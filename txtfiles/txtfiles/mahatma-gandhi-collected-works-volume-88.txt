('88', 10, 2, 3, 10138) POONA, September 1, 1945
('88', 10, 3, 4, 10163) MY DEAR DHANNO 1, I wonder whether you know Gujarati, Hindustani or Sindhi, seeing that you write to me in bad English?
('88', 10, 3, 5, 10283) Your mother knows Hindustani and Sindhi.
('88', 10, 3, 6, 10324) Your father knew all the above three well.
('88', 10, 3, 7, 10367) But this I write in the language you evidently know best.
('88', 10, 3, 8, 10425) You see now is the time for every patriot to be tested.
('88', 10, 3, 9, 10481) You wear khadi not for family tradition which may or may not be good, not for my sake (that would be of no use), not for the poor (there are other ways of serving them perhaps), but for swaraj to be gained non violently.
('88', 10, 3, 10, 10702) Then you have to wear and use khadi at all cost.
('88', 10, 3, 11, 10751) Then to strengthen your conviction you may add all the other causes.
('88', 10, 3, 12, 10820) Use of khadi is the least you should do and brave the little difficulty you mention.
('88', 10, 3, 13, 10905) Supposing you slave for a showy maintenance for 10 hours, why won’t you lighten your slavery by doing recreative spinning for half an hour daily?
('88', 10, 3, 14, 11051) While you are doing it, you will have the glow of spinning swaraj daily for half an hour.
('88', 10, 3, 15, 11141) Very little if you were the only one.
('88', 10, 3, 16, 11179) But one can multiply oneself into forty crores and then there is swaraj without perhaps more.
('88', 10, 3, 17, 11273) But if you can say to yourself honestly that you have no time for non violent swaraj, you must leave khadi alone and use the cloth you like best and forget family traditions, the poor and me.
('88', 10, 3, 18, 11465) What are you earning?
('88', 10, 3, 19, 11487) Are you married?

('88', 11, 7, 17, 12399) You must have got the reply by now.
('88', 11, 7, 18, 12435) I would not know if there was any defect in Khimji’s eye.
('88', 11, 7, 19, 12493) Generally I do not observe people too closely.
('88', 11, 7, 20, 12540) And if the parties choose each other despite one of them having an obvious defect, why need a third person object?
('88', 11, 7, 21, 12655) What right does even a father have ?
('88', 11, 7, 22, 12692) I have seen the blind and the crippled also getting married.
('88', 11, 7, 23, 12753) I would be very much surprised if Munnalal has raised any objection.

('88', 12, 2, 3, 13090) MUNNALAL, Naraharibhai writes to tell me that as Khimji has a defect in his eye you have raised an objection to his marrying Vina and are even ready to write to her father.
('88', 12, 2, 4, 13263) This surprises me.
('88', 12, 2, 5, 13282) I, therefore, used an “if” in my reply 1 to Narahari.
('88', 12, 2, 6, 13336) When K. and N. have made the selection, what objection can we have?
('88', 12, 2, 7, 13404) Besides, how can you write to Vina’s father?
('88', 12, 2, 8, 13449) Vina is not marrying the man in defiance of anybody’s advice.
('88', 12, 2, 9, 13511) I personally do not see what right a father can have to interfere if the two have selected each other despite an obvious defect in one of them.

('88', 17, 9, 21, 20542) You can’t express yourself well in English and why shouldn’t Prabhakar write to Sushilabehn?
('88', 17, 9, 22, 20635) They have not made you the supervisor.
('88', 17, 9, 23, 20674) Your ignorance and vanity is eating you up.
('88', 17, 9, 24, 20718) Remember that the only true right is what is acquired by doing one’s duty.
('88', 17, 9, 25, 20793) And now that all of you are fighting against cholera, where is the question of possessing any right ?
('88', 17, 9, 26, 20895) Never mind if people do not want to get inoculated.
('88', 17, 9, 27, 20947) Let them die, if they are prepared to.
('88', 17, 9, 28, 20986) They will have to be kept isolated if they contract cholera.

('88', 18, 11, 14, 21803) In the course of their interview, the two leaders asked Mahatma Gandhi as to whether the Hindustan Mazdoor Sevak Sangh like the Indian National Congress and the All India Trade Union Congress could adopt the words “peaceful and legitimate” instead of “truth and non violence” in its constitution.
('88', 18, 11, 15, 22100) Mahatma Gandhi is understood to have replied that he disagreed with those who held that “truth and

('88', 18, 12, 17, 22661) The discussion, therefore, must have taken place before Sunday, September 2.

('88', 19, 1, 2, 22779) non violence” were not political terms.
('88', 19, 1, 3, 22819) In the political context, the words “peaceful and legitimate” were considered to be more appropriate.
('88', 19, 1, 4, 22921) Even this expression, Mahatma Gandhi said, had been introduced by him in the Congress constitution 1. Since they had to deal with the working class, the objection on grounds of political terminology did not matter.
('88', 19, 1, 5, 23136) The workers must be told in a straight and direct way as to what they should or should not do.
('88', 19, 2, 6, 23231) On the question of trusteeship, which was absent from the constitution of the Sangh, Mahatma Gandhi is said to have pointed out that since the theory of trusteeship was stressed by him and had a permanent association with his name, it was legitimate to make it a matter of dispute.
('88', 19, 2, 7, 23513) He said that he did not want to accentuate class struggle.
('88', 19, 2, 8, 23572) The owners should become trustees.
('88', 19, 2, 9, 23607) They might insist that they should become trustees and yet they might choose to remain owners.
('88', 19, 2, 10, 23702) We shall then have to oppose and fight them.
('88', 19, 2, 11, 23747) Satyagraha will then be our weapon.
('88', 19, 2, 12, 23783) Even if we want a classless society we should not engage in a civil war.

('88', 21, 6, 8, 25963) AMIN, Today I am sending a wire 1 regarding your fast.
('88', 21, 6, 9, 26018) There is a rule that no one should go on a fast without my permission.
('88', 21, 6, 10, 26089) It is possible that you are not aware of it but Prabhakar knows this.
('88', 21, 6, 11, 26159) Both of you are at fault in going on a fast.
('88', 21, 6, 12, 26204) When all of you should render service in treating [cholera] patients, why enfeeble yourselves by fasting?
('88', 21, 6, 13, 26310) I would say that those who are not willing to be inoculated against cholera should not be persuaded to do so by fasting.
('88', 21, 6, 14, 26431) Those who cannot abide by the rules of an institution should leave it.
('88', 21, 6, 15, 26502) We do not have such rules [in our Ashram].
('88', 21, 6, 16, 26545) I am primarily responsible for this because I do not believe in inoculation, etc.
('88', 21, 6, 17, 26627) Right from South Africa I have been holding these views.
('88', 21, 6, 18, 26684) We should make arrangements for those who wish to be inoculated but we should not force those who are unwilling by resorting to a fast.
('88', 21, 6, 19, 26820) If you want to know when one can go on a fast, come to me when I have some leisure.
('88', 21, 6, 20, 26904) Who were the persons involved in beating Kotwal?
('88', 21, 6, 21, 26953) What happened to him?

('88', 26, 8, 13, 32787) I purposely write to you in English.
('88', 26, 8, 14, 32824) I mentioned not 14 letters in the Urdu script but 14 scripts collected on the chart shown to you.
('88', 26, 8, 15, 32922) I see that you can listen to hearsay even though it is contrary to the evidence of your senses.
('88', 26, 8, 16, 33018) You should know that Kakasaheb is himself a Maharashtrian and so are my many associates.
('88', 26, 8, 17, 33107) I was referring to a well known verse of the Gita 2. It asks us not to leave what may appear to be a lesser duty for what may happen to be a higher.
('88', 26, 8, 18, 33256) And I paid a compliment to Maharashtrians who stick to their jobs no matter how difficult they are.
('88', 26, 8, 19, 33356) Urdu is not so difficult as your friend has made it out.
('88', 26, 8, 20, 33413) I know many who have learnt the Urdu script in less than a week.
('88', 26, 8, 21, 33478) My offer to teach you Urdu script within a week still stands.

('88', 27, 6, 11, 34242) If it is very difficult, we should not try it.
('88', 27, 6, 12, 34289) It would not matter if we failed.
('88', 27, 6, 13, 34323) I would suggest that the amount raised in Bombay should be added to the collection from Gujarat.
('88', 27, 6, 14, 34420) The Bombay committee should be incorporated with the Gujarat committee and the whole amount should be spent for the Memorial.
('88', 27, 6, 15, 34546) This would be befitting and would bring credit to Mahadev’s name.
('88', 27, 6, 16, 34612) I think the permanent place for the Memorial should be in Ahmedabad.
('88', 27, 6, 17, 34681) If a branch is necessary a place can be rented in Bombay.

('88', 41, 6, 9, 51801) SANKARAN, I am pained as well as surprised by what I hear about you.
('88', 41, 6, 10, 51870) If you have to be told at every step, there is no point in telling you anything.
('88', 41, 6, 11, 51951) Scolding Prabhakar, not listening to Kishorelalbhai and lastly refusing to work when cholera is widespread, all this is unworthy of you.
('88', 41, 6, 12, 52088) I have sent a telegram 1 today.
('88', 41, 6, 13, 52120) If you can quietly serve at the Ashram, do so, otherwise leave it and go wherever you wish to.

('88', 51, 8, 14, 64250) I have passed the budget for Rs. 810. I shall pass the other one also but I have had a committee set up for the camp 2. I want to pass it after making any changes that may be necessary after the committee submits its report.
('88', 51, 8, 15, 64475) The committee has given me the authority about Assam, so if there is any delay I shall be to blame.
('88', 51, 8, 16, 64575) But I shall not let that happen.
('88', 51, 8, 17, 64608) The purchase of muga 3 should be taken in hand.
('88', 51, 8, 18, 64656) With regard to the method it will be enough if the following things are kept in mind: 1. Let the work of the camp be based on the principle of self sufficiency.
('88', 51, 8, 19, 64817) This means that the camp should become self sufficient by the time it is wound up.
('88', 51, 8, 20, 64900) There would thus be no harm if the camp is kept going for a longer period.
('88', 51, 8, 21, 64975) Maybe, prolonging it will lead to knowledge becoming richer and deeper.
('88', 51, 8, 22, 65047) 2. Spinning and the entire processing of cotton should be done with full knowledge.
('88', 51, 8, 23, 65131) 3. Some good craft should also be taught.
('88', 51, 8, 24, 65173) That too should be done with full knowledge.
('88', 51, 8, 25, 65218) There should be perfect cleanliness in the camp as also among individuals.

('88', 52, 1, 3, 65546) 5. The work of the camp should be done so far as possible by the inmates.
('88', 52, 1, 4, 65620) Let there be as few servants as possible.
('88', 52, 1, 5, 65662) 6. The workers, as far as possible, should be women.
('88', 52, 1, 6, 65715) 7. The camp should be located in or near a village and the life in the camp should resemble the life of the villagers.
('88', 52, 1, 7, 65834) I have written this much by way of giving guidelines.

('88', 54, 5, 20, 69080) DEAR SIR VISVESVARAYYA 1, I have your letter of the 7th July.
('88', 54, 5, 21, 69142) I know I am very late in replying to it but it was inevitable.
('88', 54, 5, 22, 69205) As it is I am sending even this late line under pressure.
('88', 54, 5, 23, 69263) I appreciate your zeal in the cause you have at heart and marvel at the fact that at your time of life you throw into your work so much energy and thought.
('88', 54, 5, 24, 69419) There, however, my appreciation, I fear, stands.
('88', 54, 5, 25, 69468) Of course, verbally our objectives appear the same but when I look at our means, the difference seems to me to be unbridgeable.
('88', 54, 5, 26, 69596) It may be that both of us being old and hardened are unable to see eye to eye.
('88', 54, 5, 27, 69675) If you regard South Africa as an elongated part of the West, I have passed the best part of my life in the West.
('88', 54, 5, 28, 69788) I have seen people, high and low, working with amazing speed and with the most modern machinery, the income of the commonest European labourer being higher than that of the American.
('88', 54, 5, 29, 69971) Yet it was there that I learnt to recoil from their method and manner.

('88', 55, 1, 3, 70255) Things, therefore, that attract you do not attract me but rather repel me.
('88', 55, 1, 4, 70330) Much as I would love to work as a humble co worker side by side with you, I cannot.
('88', 55, 1, 5, 70414) Your detailed, patient replies 1 carefully prepared, fail to convince me.
('88', 55, 1, 6, 70488) What is the use of taxing you further with my questions?
('88', 55, 1, 7, 70545) Let me tell you that I claim to have been working schemes fairly successfully among the village population with well knit organizations.
('88', 55, 1, 8, 70682) Nearly four crores (as I can recall) have been distributed among the villagers, not as doles, but for solid work done—and this in the face of heavy odds.
('88', 55, 1, 9, 70836) Had it not been for the opposition of the Government and their unreasoned wrath after the August of 1942, the said organizations would have shown greater results.
('88', 55, 1, 10, 70999) But I cannot expect you with your Krishnasagar marvels to your credit even to look at my scheme.
('88', 55, 1, 11, 71096) I can, therefore, only conclude by expressing my eagerness to follow not your scheme but your solid work and learn from it, if I see anything to learn.
('88', 55, 1, 12, 71248) I hope you are keeping perfectly well and fit.

('88', 56, 11, 22, 72950) NARANDAS, I got your letter and the statement.
('88', 56, 11, 23, 72997) You will see that I have made many changes in the statement.
('88', 56, 11, 24, 73058) I do hope that you will understand the reasons behind them.
('88', 56, 11, 25, 73118) They do not violate the existing rules of the Charkha Sangh.
('88', 56, 11, 26, 73179) Just now my advice to you is that you may follow the practice of offering 1_ per cent discount to any member buying khadi worth Rs. 100 from the store which you are running or the stores which are being run under your supervision in Kathiawar.
('88', 56, 11, 27, 73423) If the Charkha Sangh accepts this rule, it should decide to buy khadi only from the stores under the control of the respective branches.
('88', 57, 0, 1, 73560) 58 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('88', 57, 1, 2, 73601) instead, a member from Kanyakumari wants to buy khadi from a store under the Punjab branch, there will be a danger of extensive malpractices.
('88', 57, 1, 3, 73743) Your scheme does have my blessings, of course.
('88', 57, 1, 4, 73790) I will, moreover, definitely send something with anybody from here going there.
('88', 57, 1, 5, 73870) Balasaheb Kher is engaged on the 2nd and the 3rd.
('88', 57, 1, 6, 73920) He, therefore, cannot come.
('88', 57, 1, 7, 73948) He has suggested the following names in his place.
('88', 57, 1, 8, 73999) Narahari Parikh, Morarji Desai, Kaka Kalelkar, Dada Maval ankar.
('88', 57, 1, 9, 74064) From among them Kaka Kalelkar is here.
('88', 57, 1, 10, 74103) I met him.
('88', 57, 1, 11, 74114) I think he will be able to give the maximum work.
('88', 57, 1, 12, 74164) Narahari cannot be spared at all just now.
('88', 57, 1, 13, 74207) He has taken upon himself a lot of work.
('88', 57, 1, 14, 74248) Kaka can arrive there on the 1st and must return on the 4th.
('88', 57, 1, 15, 74309) He will not, therefore, be able to undertake a long tour there.
('88', 57, 1, 16, 74373) He has agreed to attend an important meeting in Bombay on the 6th.
('88', 57, 1, 17, 74440) You are entering your 60th year today, but according to me you should aspire to live for another 60 years still.
('88', 57, 1, 18, 74553) You may, therefore, be said to have completed half the journey.
('88', 57, 1, 19, 74617) Only today I read in a book that a man should aspire to live 150 years.
('88', 57, 1, 20, 74689) Even if the millions could entertain such an aspiration, it would be meaningless, for the condition affixed is that the person concerned should spend all these years in service in the spirit of yajna, that is, without attachment.
('88', 57, 1, 21, 74919) It is an extremely dfficult job to practise non attachment.
('88', 57, 1, 22, 74979) But anybody who can cultivate it is sure to live up to 125, and you have the ability to cultivate it.

('88', 57, 5, 28, 75321) Go through it and if you think that what he has stated is right, we should try to have such members from all over the country.
('88', 57, 5, 29, 75448) I think it is almost impossible to implement what he has suggested regarding the Congress as we do not have the required atmosphere.

('88', 58, 5, 9, 76028) DEAR FRIEND, I am sorry that I have to worry you almost immediately on your return from London.
('88', 58, 5, 10, 76124) My only excuse is that my mission is purely humanitarian.
('88', 58, 5, 11, 76182) Shri Haridas Mitra, an M.A. of the Calcutta University and the husband of Shri Subhas Chandra Bose’s young niece 1, aged 22 years, is under sentence of death over what appears to be an untenable ground.
('88', 58, 5, 12, 76385) I have perused the petition for mercy by the uncle of the condemned as also of Advocate Carden Noad.
('88', 58, 5, 13, 76486) I suggest that they furnish cogent grounds for the exercise of mercy.
('88', 58, 5, 14, 76556) In any event the case for mercy becomes irresistible in that the war with Japan is over.
('88', 58, 5, 15, 76645) It will be a political error of the first magnitude if this sentence of death is carried into effect.
('88', 58, 5, 16, 76747) I rejoiced to learn that you had ordered postponement of execution till after consideration of the case by you on your return.
('88', 58, 5, 17, 76874) My attention was drawn to the case by the prisoner’s wife as she has often sung at my prayer meetings when I had the honour of being a guest of Advocate Sarat Chandra Bose whom I am happy to learn the Government of India has ordered to be released.

('88', 59, 3, 5, 77624) It is rather strange that often one cannot distinguish between a friend and a foe.
('88', 59, 3, 6, 77707) Another strange thing is that you make yourself a foreigner by not writing in your mother tongue.

('88', 59, 8, 15, 78167) But he is extremely hot tempered and I run away from hot tempered people.
('88', 59, 8, 16, 78241) That is why I do not interfere in his affairs.
('88', 59, 8, 17, 78288) Lakshminarayanji 1 has sent the copies of the letters he has written to him.
('88', 59, 8, 18, 78365) Why should I get involved?
('88', 59, 8, 19, 78392) And so I shall only say that if you two follow what seems to you pure truth I shall be satisfied.

('88', 61, 10, 17, 80276) This is a place for prayers and not for public meetings.
('88', 61, 10, 18, 80333) By their foolish and improper behaviour, those who disturbed me and other occupants in the clinic have demonstrated that they did not come for prayer.
('88', 61, 10, 19, 80484) 1 I know there are people who do not believe in the existence of God.
('88', 61, 10, 20, 80554) I met them in England and there may be some here.
('88', 61, 10, 21, 80604) They ask, ‘Where is God ?’ and ‘If there is God, why is there so much distress in this world ?’ But those who believe in God and prayers cannot show God.
('88', 61, 10, 22, 80758) We expect that these prayers will have some effect on the minds of those who join us in the prayers.
('88', 61, 10, 23, 80859) I know you love your leaders and want to see and hear them.
('88', 61, 10, 24, 80919) But it is wrong to force them to come out here after the hard work they have been doing or when they have left this place.
('88', 61, 10, 25, 81042) You will have opportunity to see and hear them at other public meetings.

('88', 62, 11, 20, 82065) About the election you may write to Sardar and decide.

('88', 63, 3, 6, 82708) From this point of view, we should mourn on our birthday.
('88', 63, 3, 7, 82766) And if one gives blessings, one should do so to express the hope that, if the person has not fully known God in the years that have passed, he will spend the rest of his life in an endeavour to know Him.
('88', 63, 3, 8, 82970) Have you started learning the Urdu script?

('88', 66, 6, 14, 87298) MUNNALAL, I got your letter.
('88', 66, 6, 15, 87327) You raise ridiculous objections.
('88', 66, 6, 16, 87360) You yourself have admitted that you write long letters.
('88', 66, 6, 17, 87416) I drew your attention to it merely to correct you.
('88', 66, 6, 18, 87467) There is no question of my being offended.
('88', 66, 6, 19, 87510) I had read the portion regarding Parnerkar, I had no comment to make on it.
('88', 66, 6, 20, 87586) Something can be done only after I return there.
('88', 66, 6, 21, 87635) I have in any case written to Parnerkar.
('88', 66, 6, 22, 87676) 1 I myself feel confused.
('88', 66, 6, 23, 87702) You yourself told me that you speak too much.
('88', 66, 6, 24, 87748) You lose patience and get angry.
('88', 66, 6, 25, 87781) If you forget this fact, how will you be able to reform yourself ?
('88', 66, 6, 26, 87848) You work hard enough, but spoil everything by speaking too much.
('88', 66, 6, 27, 87913) Won’t you admit this ?
('88', 66, 6, 28, 87936) What matters in the prayer is the tune.
('88', 66, 6, 29, 87976) It is a matter of common sense as to what should be done when your voice is not in tune with that of others or the voices of others are not in tune with yours.
('88', 66, 6, 30, 88136) Praying therefore is not the remedy.
('88', 66, 6, 31, 88173) The question is of knowing the tune.
('88', 66, 6, 32, 88210) Go on serving.

('88', 67, 3, 5, 88598) I see that from all quarters and in every way you got only injustice.
('88', 67, 3, 6, 88668) Have you ever paused to think that when we seem to suffer injustice from all quarters, the weakness may really be our own, viz., of seeing wrong in others?
('88', 67, 3, 7, 88824) Did you take up goseva only because of Jamnalalji or me and not for your own sake?
('88', 67, 3, 8, 88907) Your faith seems superficial.
('88', 67, 3, 9, 88937) May you all stay well.

('88', 67, 8, 18, 89297) Let the committee decide about chillies.
('88', 67, 8, 19, 89338) It seems right to give chillies to those who stay in the Ashram without being its members or to those for whom the doctor may recommend it.
('88', 67, 8, 20, 89478) Kailas 1 has come to observe all the rules of the Ashram.
('88', 67, 8, 21, 89536) She should not desire to break them.
('88', 67, 8, 22, 89573) It is another matter if the doctor recommends it on grounds of health.

('88', 68, 3, 6, 90087) Nor is the handwriting yours.
('88', 68, 3, 7, 90117) I have already written to Joshiji 2. I cannot go into the facts.

('88', 72, 7, 12, 95000) Till today I have not been able to read the pamphlet.
('88', 72, 7, 13, 95054) And ever if I had sent my reply, I think it would have been impossible to send the circulars to all the Provinces and get their replies in time.
('88', 72, 7, 14, 95199) How can we work in such haste?
('88', 72, 7, 15, 95230) And it is almost impossible for me to send my reply by return of post.
('88', 72, 7, 16, 95301) At times I could reply to brief letters but not always.
('88', 72, 7, 17, 95357) What shall we do in such a situation?
('88', 72, 7, 18, 95395) It would be better not to wait for my permission for what is to be done urgently and in case it is imperative to have my permission I should be informed telegra phically.
('88', 72, 7, 19, 95566) Then perhaps it would be possible for me to keep the reply ready.
('88', 72, 7, 20, 95632) I have gone through all the circulars.
('88', 72, 7, 21, 95671) I think there is no need for any amendment.
('88', 72, 7, 22, 95715) If the circulars are not sent as yet, change the dates and send them out and they should be placed before the Committee’s next meeting or a copy should be sent to all after getting the reply.
('88', 72, 7, 23, 95907) Yesterday I got Suchetabehn’s letter.
('88', 72, 7, 24, 95945) I am enclosing it.
('88', 72, 7, 25, 95964) It should be kept in the office and a copy should be sent to Bapa.
('88', 72, 7, 26, 96031) It would be better that she gives us a trial and we give her a trial for three months.
('88', 72, 7, 27, 96118) And later on she can stay permanently if she is prepared to.
('88', 72, 7, 28, 96179) She can keep travelling between Allahabad and Wardha.

('88', 74, 8, 14, 98295) Your handwriting is good but not clear enough to be read easily.
('88', 74, 8, 15, 98360) If you write slightly bigger letters and do not mix them up, it will be easier to decipher.
('88', 74, 8, 16, 98452) You cannot ride on two horses.
('88', 74, 8, 17, 98483) A family cannot run properly if all the children stay with the parents all the time.
('88', 74, 8, 18, 98568) When children grow older, they have to go out for earning, studying or serving.
('88', 74, 8, 19, 98648) And when they go out, they have to forget their old and ailing parents.
('88', 74, 8, 20, 98720) So why do you feel unhappy for what is inevitable?
('88', 74, 8, 21, 98771) When your parents sent you out, they and you yourself must have thought not only that your duty was to serve your parents, but that it was time that you started earning and lessened their burden.
('88', 74, 8, 22, 98967) That is exactly what you are doing.
('88', 74, 8, 23, 99003) It is good that you are doing all your work and slowly learning every thing.
('88', 74, 8, 24, 99080) You will bring credit to yourself, your parents and the Ashram if you settle down there, stop worrying and take care of your health.
('88', 74, 8, 25, 99213) I am very happy to know that you wanted to have chillies but gave them up on your own.

('88', 75, 0, 1, 99381) 76 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('88', 75, 1, 2, 99422) used to chillies that they would rather die than give them up.
('88', 75, 1, 3, 99485) This shows that taking chillies is not a good habit.
('88', 75, 1, 4, 99538) In India it so happens that the poor cannot afford anything else and they add a few chillies and salt to the rotla 1 to somehow make it digestible.
('88', 75, 1, 5, 99686) To conclude from this that all must take chillies is sheer ignorance.
('88', 75, 1, 6, 99756) When a person takes all kinds of food including rotlas as well, the latter cannot be regarded as part of his diet.
('88', 75, 1, 7, 99871) On the contrary they may be superfluous and might even prove to be harmful.

('88', 75, 5, 13, 100132) I have your letter.
('88', 75, 5, 14, 100152) When a person takes beer with two per cent alcohol content and is forbidden to take whisky with 75 per cent alcohol content, can I ask why beer and why not whisky?
('88', 75, 5, 15, 100316) You must see also that when we drink lemonade or eat things with some alcohol content in them nobody says that we are taking alcohol.
('88', 75, 5, 16, 100450) Equate chillies with whisky and then consider if chillies can go with turmeric or coriander.
('88', 75, 5, 17, 100543) Taking spices does not mean consuming all kinds of spices.
('88', 75, 5, 18, 100602) There is said to be a lot of difference between green chillies and red chillies.
('88', 75, 5, 19, 100683) It is surprising that all these simple things have escaped your attention.
('88', 75, 5, 20, 100758) Whatever spices we give, like turmeric, black pepper, coriander, etc., are given on doctor’s recommendation and on grounds of health.
('88', 75, 5, 21, 100892) Even so, who can prevent anyone from eating for taste, and how can it be done?
('88', 75, 5, 22, 100971) Have you not heard that a Vaghari 2 woman used to relish greatly a two day stale bajra chapati without ghee, but when she was given kheer 3 and wheat halwa 43 to eat every day she started shrinking and fell ill in the end.
('88', 75, 5, 23, 101194) Shall we then say that this Vaghari woman had con quered her palate and subsisted on dry bread, chillies and salt?
('88', 75, 5, 24, 101309) What else should I write?

('88', 76, 1, 2, 101480) Why did you not ask me till today about taking chillies on grounds of health?
('88', 76, 1, 3, 101558) Of course we do let Shakaribehn have chillies willingly.
('88', 76, 1, 4, 101615) But how can we give it to others?
('88', 76, 1, 5, 101649) The reason is not that chillies have no good qualities at all.
('88', 76, 1, 6, 101712) They certainly have some medicinal value.
('88', 76, 1, 7, 101754) But chillies have no place in a hospital except as a “pain killer” which is an extract of chillies.
('88', 76, 1, 8, 101854) In the Ashram we neither take nor give anything merely for taste.
('88', 76, 1, 9, 101920) But we do not ask everybody whether they relish what they eat and if they do so they should leave the Ashram.
('88', 76, 1, 10, 102030) If we take this view, none but animals and birds will be left in the Ashram.
('88', 76, 1, 11, 102107) Kamle should somehow calm down and improve his health.
('88', 76, 1, 12, 102162) I have already written about Purnachandraji.
('88', 76, 1, 13, 102207) While living in the Ashram everyone has to observe brahmacharya.
('88', 76, 1, 14, 102272) I did not know about Ramprasadji.
('88', 76, 1, 15, 102306) But I was under the impression that Ramprasad’s house was a little away from the other houses of the Ashram.
('88', 76, 1, 16, 102415) Niamat’s room was also there but she was never asked whether she wanted to observe brahmacharya.
('88', 76, 1, 17, 102512) But I had thought that Ramprasad had not come to live in the Ashram like Niamat.
('88', 76, 1, 18, 102593) However, when I came to know that the manner in which they lived they could even produce children I was perturbed.
('88', 76, 1, 19, 102708) Besides others this is the strorgest reason for one to leave the Ashram.
('88', 76, 1, 20, 102781) His having a separate kitchen also used to irk me.
('88', 76, 1, 21, 102832) But since this had been allowed in the case of others I could not be too insistent in dissuading him.
('88', 76, 1, 22, 102934) It is not enough to assume that Purnachandraji must be obser ving brahmacharya while staying in the Ashram.
('88', 76, 1, 23, 103042) It is necessary to ask him clearly.
('88', 76, 1, 24, 103078) I hope to go to Poona from here on the 24th.

('88', 77, 10, 24, 104897) But if you find it difficult to do even that much, we cannot achieve swaraj through ahimsa.
('88', 77, 10, 25, 104989) It would be no loss either to the country or to the cause of khadi if those who lacked this zeal left khadi alone.

('88', 78, 5, 7, 105430) Dr. Bharatan Kumarappa has, in his pages on “Villagism”, a new word coined by him, furnished the lay reader and the village worker, not conversant with books on economics, a comparative and historical study of the modern movements known as Capitalism and Socialism, not excluding Marxism and Communism, and has earnestly, and I think convincingly, shown, amongst other reasons advanced by him, that the past two wars of our generation have proved the utter bankruptcy of such economic orders.
('88', 78, 5, 8, 105923) Incidentally, the wars seem to me to have proved the bankruptcy of war, meaning in forcible and naked language violence, which is not less because it is organized by States reputed to be civilized.
('88', 78, 5, 9, 106121) Whether non violence will effectively replace violence for keeping the peace of the world remains to be seen.
('88', 78, 5, 10, 106231) Certain it is that mankind, if it continues along its mad career of exploitation of the weak by the strong, must rush to annihilation fore told in all religions.
('88', 78, 5, 11, 106393) Dr. Bharatan Kumarappa shows that “Villagism” as it is being attempted in India, based as it is on truth and non violence, is well calculated to avert the doom.
('88', 78, 5, 12, 106554) If the reader is interested in the life saving process, he must turn to the instructive pages written by Dr. Bharatan Kumarappa during his recent imprisonment.

('88', 82, 10, 22, 111234) If our case is weak, we should not defend it just for the sake of defence.
('88', 82, 10, 23, 111309) It often happens that morally we are right and if by defending our case our position becomes clearer, in spite of realizing that we will lose in the end, it becomes our dharma to defend it.
('88', 82, 10, 24, 111499) I have done this quite often and succeeded also.
('88', 82, 10, 25, 111548) That is why I am putting this before you.
('88', 82, 10, 26, 111590) I hope Dadasaheb 2 will reach there in time.

('88', 82, 10, 29, 111764) But you have every right to include all those things as defects.
('88', 82, 10, 30, 111829) I would do so.

('88', 88, 3, 5, 117576) Still I shall say this: The yajna this time is of a different character.
('88', 88, 3, 6, 117649) Yarn is taking the place of gold and silver coins.
('88', 88, 3, 7, 117700) In other words, labour takes the place of currency and claims equality with it.
('88', 88, 3, 8, 117780) If this new practice is kept up and spreads, it will have effects too far reaching to be estimated.
('88', 88, 3, 9, 117880) In this there should be no place for fraud or untruth.
('88', 88, 3, 10, 117935) Even the best of plans are ruined if they are mixed with fraud or untruth.

('88', 88, 6, 17, 118245) Kishorelal.
('88', 88, 6, 18, 118257) Both are worth thinking over.
('88', 88, 6, 19, 118287) The subject matter in each is different and yet the same.

('88', 88, 6, 21, 118429) How did a saintly person like Kishorelal, working under Parnerkar, accept defeat?
('88', 88, 6, 22, 118511) Do not get muddled.
('88', 88, 6, 23, 118531) Leave the letter aside if you are unable to make head or tail of it.
('88', 88, 6, 24, 118600) Everyone will not benefit by reading it.
('88', 88, 6, 25, 118641) Only you three should read it.

('88', 88, 6, 27, 118767) Give it up if too much time is consumed in discussion.
('88', 88, 6, 28, 118822) Naraharibhai is the secretary of the Committee, so he should think over both the letters: 1. Should the institutions be kept separate ?
('88', 88, 6, 29, 118958) Will that be possible now ?
('88', 88, 6, 30, 118986) (The subject matter of K.’s letter.,) 2. Can’t two neighbours live in amity?
('88', 88, 6, 31, 119063) They may cultivate the land separately and have their cattle, fruit trees, and water supply separate.
('88', 88, 6, 32, 119165) (The subject matter of Parnerkar’s letter.) Yesterday there was a letter from Gordhandas.

('88', 93, 8, 13, 125104) This is an effective collection made by Shri P. D. Tandon 2 out of numerous writings of numerous admirers of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
('88', 93, 8, 14, 125238) It gives at a glance a good picture of the patriot as seen by various eyes.
('88', 93, 8, 15, 125314) He shines easily as father, brother, writer, traveller, patriot or internationalist.
('88', 93, 8, 16, 125399) Nevertheless it is as an ardent devotee of his country and its freedom on whose altar he would sacrifice all his other loves that the leader will specially single him out from the essays.
('88', 93, 8, 17, 125587) Be it said to his credit, however, that he will consider it beneath his dignity to purchase that freedom at the price of any other country.
('88', 93, 8, 18, 125727) His nationalism is equal to internationalism.

('88', 96, 1, 4, 128804) If you have sent anything to Nava Kal 1 similar to what you wrote to me, you have made a mistake.
('88', 96, 1, 5, 128902) I have written to Bapa regarding your camp.

('88', 97, 6, 16, 130999) [September 1945] It is true that the Congress adopted khadi, the Spinners’ Association imposed the condition of the yarn quota and khadi which is not certified by the Association is taboo for Congressmen.
('88', 97, 6, 17, 131204) A certain quantity of yarn has to be given as part of the price of khadi.
('88', 97, 6, 18, 131278) All this is true.
('88', 97, 6, 19, 131296) But I do not find anything wrong in this.
('88', 97, 6, 20, 131338) That action alone can be compulsion where there is penalty for refusing to do a particular thing.
('88', 97, 6, 21, 131436) What the form of punishment should be is a different matter.
('88', 97, 6, 22, 131497) There is no compulsion if I demand the price of khadi and refuse to give it free.
('88', 97, 6, 23, 131579) Similarly there is some condition or other attached to membership in any institution.
('88', 97, 6, 24, 131665) It is also no compulsion if subseque ntly any change is made in such conditions.
('88', 97, 6, 25, 131746) The case of uncertified kkadi is also similar.
('88', 97, 6, 26, 131793) If we go in for uncertified khadi, where is the guarantee of its purity and that a proper wage has been paid to the spinner ?
('88', 97, 6, 27, 131919) With the advance of time and experience, changes have to be made in the rules and regulations.
('88', 97, 6, 28, 132014) The only questions to be consi dered are whether the change fulfils the object, is in keeping with the principle of truth and non violence, and is actuated by selfish or
('88', 97, 7, 29, 132184) 1 This was in reply to a correspondent who had asked: “You persuaded the Congress to adopt khadi wear for its members and introduced the rule of yarn quota for the A. I. S. A. khadi.
('88', 97, 7, 30, 132367) Congressmen are prohibited from using khadi other than that certified by the A. I. S. A., and now khadi cannot be had from the Association without paying the yarn quota.
('88', 97, 7, 31, 132537) Is this not compulsion?”

('88', 98, 1, 2, 132606) benevolent motives.
('88', 98, 1, 3, 132626) The answer to all these questions will show that the change was to fulfil the original object and the question of compulsion does not arise.
('88', 98, 2, 4, 132767) I should be thanked if, against my goods, I ask for yarn or some
('88', 98, 3, 5, 132832) other commodity in place of money.
('88', 98, 4, 6, 132867) Let us go a little deeper.
('88', 98, 4, 7, 132894) We believe that khadi is only for those
('88', 98, 5, 8, 132934) who believe that non violent swaraj can be established by making khadi universal.
('88', 98, 5, 9, 133016) Spinning, even for a little time, by the greatest number of people will be helpful in obtaining swaraj.
('88', 98, 5, 10, 133120) We do not therefore spin under compulsion but of our own accord.
('88', 98, 5, 11, 133185) An additional gain is that through spinning we come in direct contact with the poor.
('88', 98, 6, 12, 133270) Therefore, I am quite clear that there is absolutely no com 
('88', 98, 7, 13, 133331) pulsion in demanding part of the price of khadi in the form of yarn.

('88', 98, 22, 27, 133695) 1 to the Sardar.
('88', 98, 22, 28, 133712) I detect in it your worry.

('88', 99, 1, 3, 134124) The Sardar has said nothing to anybody.
('88', 99, 1, 4, 134164) He, however, does feel that among Congress circles you have lost your popularity.
('88', 99, 2, 5, 134246) That, however, should be matter of no moment to you.
('88', 99, 2, 6, 134299) You will serve if your services are required.
('88', 99, 2, 7, 134345) My own opinion is that you will be wanted in due time.
('88', 99, 2, 8, 134400) But I do not want you to feel over the thing.
('88', 99, 2, 9, 134446) You do not imagine that the Sardar has a magic ward.
('88', 99, 2, 10, 134499) He can go only to a certain extent and no farther.
('88', 99, 2, 11, 134550) If he overstepped his limits he would lose what infIuence he has.
('88', 99, 2, 12, 134616) What I suggest is that you should come here whilst we are both here and let us amuse ourselves.
('88', 99, 2, 13, 134712) Let the elections 2 take care of themselves.
('88', 99, 2, 14, 134757) I would like your name among the candidates but that too without an effort.
('88', 99, 2, 15, 134833) But all these things can be discussed here.
('88', 99, 2, 16, 134877) You should give yourself ample time with me.

('88', 109, 10, 20, 147368) DINSHAW, 1. The dirt which is there in the clinic all the time should be completely removed.
('88', 109, 10, 21, 147461) There should not be any leakage.
('88', 109, 10, 22, 147494) Cleanliness should have the first place in nature cure.

('88', 109, 10, 24, 147599) 2. I have taken deep thought about the clinic and am daily thinking about it.
('88', 109, 10, 25, 147677) I am convinced that you should run it.
('88', 109, 10, 26, 147716) It is better that we have a trust but that is a small thing.
('88', 109, 10, 27, 147777) If a university is to come up it will be only from the clinic.
('88', 109, 10, 28, 147840) There won’t be any university if this is entrusted to someone else.
('88', 109, 10, 29, 147908) To leave this will mean giving up your vocation.

('88', 112, 6, 13, 151230) Thank God for Mother being somewhat better.
('88', 112, 6, 14, 151274) 2 It is remarkable if a bone joins at the age of 80. Normally it does not happen that I am not shown a letter which has something important to say.

('88', 112, 6, 17, 151593) I am sorry I cannot satisfy your curiosity.
('88', 112, 6, 18, 151637) I know that my horoscope was always kept perfect and up to date but that practice died away with my father.
('88', 112, 6, 19, 151745) He used to take interest in it and got the yearly forecast from it.

('88', 112, 7, 21, 151834) eldest son Shamaldas has kept all the records, so he is likely to have mine.

('88', 113, 4, 7, 152553) But this is beyond your capacity.
('88', 113, 4, 8, 152587) You have, therefore, no other option but to start a separate establishment.

('88', 116, 11, 21, 157520) NIMU, I received your letter.
('88', 116, 11, 22, 157550) Manilal and Sushila also read it.
('88', 116, 11, 23, 157584) Delhi will begin to have fine weather from this month.
('88', 116, 11, 24, 157639) At such a time, I do not like it that she should be brought to Nagpur.
('88', 116, 11, 25, 157710) Of course, ultimately, she will have to go there.
('88', 116, 11, 26, 157760) Ramdas also does not wish to bring her over to Nagpur.
('88', 116, 11, 27, 157815) Manilal and Sushila, too, are of the same view.
('88', 116, 11, 28, 157863) My suggestion, with which Manilal and Sushila agree, is that you should go to Delhi.
('88', 116, 11, 29, 157948) In your absence, Sushila will look after your home and take care of Ramdas and Kanam.
('88', 116, 11, 30, 158034) And so, you will be ab1e to remain in Delhi without worrying about anything.
('88', 116, 11, 31, 158111) Usha, too, may remain in Nagpur.
('88', 116, 11, 32, 158144) Both of you may think over the matter and then write or wire to me so that Sushila can start from here.
('88', 116, 11, 33, 158248) Neither of you should entertain the doubt that Sushila will not be willing to go there.

('88', 117, 1, 4, 158474) There will be no need for Sushila to give up her treatment to go there.
('88', 117, 1, 5, 158546) The treatment is such that she can give it up whenever she wishes.

('88', 117, 4, 8, 158734) 255. LETTER TO JAWAHARLAL NEHRU
('88', 117, 5, 9, 158766) October 5, 1945
('88', 117, 6, 10, 158782) JAWAHARLAL,
('88', 117, 7, 11, 158794) I have long been intending to write to you but can do so only today.
('88', 117, 7, 12, 158863) I have also been wondering whether I should write in English or Hindustani.
('88', 117, 7, 13, 158939) In the end I have decided to write in Hindustani.
('88', 117, 7, 14, 158989) I take first the sharp difference of opinion that has arisen between us.
('88', 117, 7, 15, 159062) If such a difference really exists people should also know about it, for the work of swaraj will suffer if they are kept in the dark.
('88', 117, 7, 16, 159196) I have said that I fully stand by the kind of governance which I have described in Hind Swaraj 1. It is not just a way of speaking.
('88', 117, 7, 17, 159328) My experience has confirmed the truth of what I wrote in 1909 2. If I were the only one left who believed in it, I would not be sorry.
('88', 117, 7, 18, 159463) For I can only testify to the truth as I see it.
('88', 117, 7, 19, 159512) I have not Hind Swaraj in front of me.
('88', 117, 7, 20, 159551) It is better that I redraw the picture today in my own language.
('88', 117, 7, 21, 159616) Then it would not matter to me whether or no the picture tallies with that of 1909 3, nor should it to you.
('88', 117, 7, 22, 159724) I do not have to establish what I had said before.
('88', 117, 7, 23, 159775) What is worth knowing is only what I have to say today.
('88', 117, 7, 24, 159831) I believe that if India, and through India the world, is to achieve real freedom, then sooner or later we shall have to go and live in the villages—in huts, not in palaces.
('88', 117, 7, 25, 160004) Millions of people can never live in cities and palaces in comfort and peace.
('88', 117, 7, 26, 160082) Nor can they do so by killing one another, that is, by resorting to violence and untruth.
('88', 117, 7, 27, 160172) I have not the slightest doubt that, but for the pair, truth and non violence, mankind will be doomed.
('88', 117, 7, 28, 160275) We can have the vision of that truth and non violence only in the simplicity of the villages.
('88', 117, 7, 29, 160369) That simplicity
('88', 117, 8, 30, 160385) 1 Vide “Hind Swaraj” 2 The source however has “1908”.
('88', 118, 0, 1, 160439) VOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 6 DECEMBER, 1945 119
('88', 118, 1, 2, 160484) resides in the spinning wheel and what is implied by the spinning wheel.
('88', 118, 1, 3, 160557) It does not frighten me at all that the world seems to be going in the opposite direction.
('88', 118, 1, 4, 160648) For the matter of that, when the moth approaches its doom it whirls round faster and faster till it is burnt up.
('88', 118, 1, 5, 160761) It is possible that India will not be able to escape this moth like circling.
('88', 118, 1, 6, 160839) It is my duty to try, till my last breath, to save India and through it the world from such a fate.
('88', 118, 1, 7, 160939) The sum and substance of what I want to say is that the individual person should have control over the things that are necessary for the sustenance of life.
('88', 118, 1, 8, 161096) If he cannot have such control the individual cannot survive.
('88', 118, 1, 9, 161158) Ultimately, the world is made up only of individuals.
('88', 118, 1, 10, 161212) If there were no drops there would be no ocean.
('88', 118, 1, 11, 161260) This is only a rough and ready statement.
('88', 118, 1, 12, 161302) There is nothing new in this.
('88', 118, 1, 13, 161332) But even in Hind Swaraj I have not said all this.
('88', 118, 1, 14, 161382) While I appre ciate modern thought, I find that an ancient thing, considered in the light of this thought looks so sweet.
('88', 118, 1, 15, 161504) You will not be able to understand me if you think that I am talking about the villages of today.
('88', 118, 1, 16, 161602) My ideal village still exists only in my imagination.
('88', 118, 1, 17, 161656) After all every human being lives in the world of his own imagination.
('88', 118, 1, 18, 161727) In this village of my dreams the villager will not be dull—he will be all awareness.
('88', 118, 1, 19, 161812) He will not live like an animal in filth and darkness.
('88', 118, 1, 20, 161867) Men and women will live in freedom, prepared to face the whole world.
('88', 118, 1, 21, 161937) There will be no plague, no cholera and no smallpox.
('88', 118, 1, 22, 161990) Nobody will be allowed to be idle or to wallow in luxury.
('88', 118, 1, 23, 162048) Everyone will have to do body labour.
('88', 118, 1, 24, 162086) Granting all this, I can still envisage a number of things that will have to be organized on a large scale.
('88', 118, 1, 25, 162194) Perhaps there will even be railways and also post and telegraph offices.
('88', 118, 1, 26, 162267) I do not know what things there will be or will not be.
('88', 118, 1, 27, 162323) Nor am I bothered about it.
('88', 118, 1, 28, 162351) If I can make sure of the essential thing, other things will follow in due course.
('88', 118, 1, 29, 162434) But if I give up the essential thing, I give up everything.
('88', 118, 1, 30, 162494) The other day, at the final day’s meeting of the Working Committee, we had taken a decision to the effect that the Working Committee would meet for two or three days to work out this very thing.
('88', 118, 1, 31, 162689) I shall be happy if it meets.
('88', 118, 1, 32, 162719) But even if it does not meet, I want that we two should understand each other fully.
('88', 118, 1, 33, 162804) And this for two reasons.
('88', 118, 1, 34, 162830) Our bond is not merely political.
('88', 118, 1, 35, 162864) It is much deeper.
('88', 118, 1, 36, 162883) I have no measure to fathom that depth.
('88', 118, 1, 37, 162923) This bond can never be broken.
('88', 118, 1, 38, 162954) I therefore want that we should understand each other thoroughly in politics as well.
('88', 118, 1, 39, 163040) The second reason is that neither of us considers
('88', 119, 0, 1, 163090) 120 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('88', 119, 1, 2, 163132) himself as worthless.
('88', 119, 1, 3, 163154) We both live only for India’s freedom, and will be happy to die too for that freedom.
('88', 119, 1, 4, 163240) We do not care for praise from any quarter.
('88', 119, 1, 5, 163284) Praise or abuse are the same to us.
('88', 119, 1, 6, 163320) They have no place in the mission of service.
('88', 119, 1, 7, 163366) Though I aspire to live up to 125 years rendering service, I am nevertheless an old man, while you are comparatively young.
('88', 119, 1, 8, 163490) That is why I have said that you are my heir.
('88', 119, 1, 9, 163536) 1 It is only proper that I should at least understand my heir and my heir in turn should understand me.
('88', 119, 1, 10, 163640) I shall then be at peace.
('88', 119, 1, 11, 163666) One thing more.
('88', 119, 1, 12, 163682) I had written to you 2 about Kasturba Trust and Hindustani.
('88', 119, 1, 13, 163742) You had said you would write after thinking things over.
('88', 119, 1, 14, 163799) I find that your name is already figuring in the Hindustani Sabha.
('88', 119, 1, 15, 163866) Nanavati reminded me that he had approached you and Maulana Saheb and that you had appended your signature.
('88', 119, 1, 16, 163974) That was in 1942. That was long ago.
('88', 119, 1, 17, 164011) You know where Hindustani stands today.
('88', 119, 1, 18, 164051) If you still stand by that signature, I wish to get some work out of you in this regard.
('88', 119, 1, 19, 164140) It will not involve much running about, but some work will be called for.
('88', 119, 1, 20, 164214) The work of Kasturba Memorial Trust is rather complicated.
('88', 119, 1, 21, 164273) I realize that if what I have said above is going to irk you or is irking you, you will not feel comfortable even in the Kasturba Trust.
('88', 119, 1, 22, 164410) The last point concerns the sparks that are flying about in the conflict with Sarat Babu.
('88', 119, 1, 23, 164500) 3 I have been pained by the episode.
('88', 119, 1, 24, 164537) I have been unable to trace it to its root.
('88', 119, 1, 25, 164581) If what you have told me is all there is to it and nothing more remains to be said, then I do not have to inquire further.
('88', 119, 1, 26, 164704) But if an explanation seems necessary, I very much want to hear it.
('88', 119, 1, 27, 164772) If we have to meet to thrash out all these matters, then we should find time for a meeting.
('88', 119, 1, 28, 164864) You are working very hard.
('88', 119, 1, 29, 164891) I trust you are in good health and Indu 4 is well.

('88', 121, 11, 23, 167460) He appreciated the efforts of Chaunde Maharaj and the Govardhan Society in preserving and developing this great wealth, and added that more concerted efforts would have to be made all over the country to achieve the desired object of giving the cow her proper place in the national economy of rural India.

('88', 122, 4, 5, 167983) Our friend Srinivasan was with me for some time about you.
('88', 122, 4, 6, 168042) It distressed me to find that you were ill and morose.
('88', 122, 4, 7, 168097) Why should you be ill?
('88', 122, 4, 8, 168120) And I could not believe that you with your fund of humour at your disposal could ever be morose even if the world went down.

('88', 136, 8, 12, 185647) I am the Chairman of the All India Spinners’ Association, a wholly philanthropic body of about 25 years’ standing, run solely in the interest of the millions of the poorest unemployed or partly unemployed women of India.
('88', 136, 8, 13, 185868) In order further to popularize hand spinning a rule was recently introduced at my instance to demand from the buyers of khadi a certain quantity of yarn in lieu of money.
('88', 136, 8, 14, 186039) Since the inception of the Association, some time known as Khadi Board,over four crores have been distributed among spinners all over India.
('88', 136, 8, 15, 186180) These include all Communities from among the poor village women.
('88', 136, 8, 16, 186245) Now, I understand, licensing rules are being issued by Provincial Administrations requiring khadi shops to take out licences as if they were dealers in millmade cloth.
('88', 136, 8, 17, 186413) Objection has also been taken to the price being partly demanded in hand spun yarn.
('88', 136, 8, 18, 186497) I am sure the Government do not intend to penalize khadi and thus the poor people.
('88', 136, 8, 19, 186580) As this is an all India matter, I venture to approach His Excellency in the hope of the impending wrong being redressed.
('88', 136, 8, 20, 186701) I may add that the matter has been taken up by the Honorary Secretary

('88', 137, 6, 7, 187205) MY DEAR JAIRAMDASBHAI,
('88', 137, 7, 8, 187228) I read out the whole of your letter to Bapu.
('88', 137, 7, 9, 187273) He says that the ban on sending yarn in large quantities to him was imposed because of the new rules preventing posting of yarn or cloth from one province to another and also in order to save postage.
('88', 137, 7, 10, 187474) He says if you can get over the rules and expense and send the yarn— if everyone insists on this—to him through someone who happens to be coming his way you may do so.
('88', 137, 7, 11, 187642) But he would prefer you to have the yarn woven into cloth and your proposals which are sound should be adopted.
('88', 137, 7, 12, 187754) You may send the dhotis, etc., to him for his personal use when anyone can bring them.
('88', 137, 7, 13, 187841) In regard to the signatures they cannot be had for less than Rs. 5 each.
('88', 137, 7, 14, 187914) Signature money can only go to the Harijan cause.
('88', 137, 7, 15, 187964) Khadi auctioned or yarn or cloth donated at the Jayanti, all goes to the A. I. S. A. I hope I have made Bapu’s wishes clear....
('88', 137, 8, 16, 188092) I am not keen on going 2 but Bapu feels I should go and take advantage of doing work by the way so to speak.
('88', 137, 8, 17, 188201) Bapu is all right again, I am glad to say.
('88', 137, 8, 18, 188244) Of course he gets tired easily.
('88', 137, 8, 19, 188276) But this place admits of good massage and treatment for him as also more protection from visitors than most others and the climate is better than [that of] Sevagram in August, September and October.
('88', 137, 8, 20, 188475) According to present plans he leaves for Sevagram on the 19th and after 9 days there leaves for Bengal, arriving in Calcutta on November 2nd.
('88', 137, 8, 21, 188617) But this depends on what progress Sardar makes this week.
('88', 137, 8, 22, 188675) Up till now there is no real improvement in his case but Bapu is hopeful that he will improve if he stays on....

('88', 138, 3, 5, 189410) There was no need to take the trouble to write it.
('88', 138, 3, 6, 189461) I would not misunderstand your not coming.
('88', 138, 3, 7, 189504) I know you quite well.
('88', 138, 3, 8, 189527) But now you must have noted that the Committee is meeting in Sevagram itself on the 25th, 26th and 27th.
('88', 138, 3, 9, 189632) If you can come at that time, do so.
('88', 138, 3, 10, 189669) But if the direct railway service has not been resumed, it is not necessary to take all that trouble for coming.

('88', 139, 6, 11, 191219) KISHORELAL,
('88', 139, 7, 12, 191231) Today just after the prayers I read with care your article on decimal coinage.
('88', 139, 7, 13, 191310) I liked it.
('88', 139, 7, 14, 191322) Why did you take so long in sending it?
('88', 139, 7, 15, 191362) Or did you send it and did I miss it by oversight?
('88', 139, 7, 16, 191413) I was in Panchgani then 2 and hardly looked at newspapers.
('88', 139, 7, 17, 191472) At present also the situation is just the same.
('88', 139, 7, 18, 191520) To say that I have carefully gone through the article does not mean that I have also checked up the calculations or that they are clear to me.
('88', 139, 7, 19, 191663) Since you are so good at calculations I take it that the figures are correct.
('88', 139, 7, 20, 191741) Suppose your figures are correct and your suggestions are very useful to the public, you cannot sit quiet after merely writing an article.
('88', 139, 7, 21, 191880) If your health permits, pursue the matter yourself or discuss it with Narahari, Jajuji and Kumarappa.
('88', 139, 7, 22, 191982) Vinoba also is an expert at figures.
('88', 139, 7, 23, 192019) If he agrees, Jajuji or Narahari can go deep into the matter and correspond with Kodanda Rao.
('88', 139, 7, 24, 192113) I am myself writing to him.
('88', 139, 7, 25, 192141) I have written to K. T. Shah 3, Vaikunth 4 and Gagan vihari and sent them copies of the article.
('88', 139, 7, 26, 192238) Now about Jajuji.
('88', 139, 7, 27, 192256) I don’t think we shall gain anything by sending him to the Assembly.
('88', 139, 7, 28, 192325) He would become weak.
('88', 139, 7, 29, 192347) Ours is a queer way of working and the people working there are even more queer.
('88', 139, 7, 30, 192428) People ask for Jajuju and others but will not listen to them after placing them on the throne.
('88', 139, 7, 31, 192523) Jajuji will be much more useful by remaining out of the Assembly.

('88', 140, 1, 5, 192965) And I am helpless because you are insisting exclusively on one thing.
('88', 140, 1, 6, 193035) I cannot understand your insistence.
('88', 140, 1, 7, 193072) But since it is backed by your peculiar line of thinking how can I counter it?
('88', 140, 1, 8, 193151) If you were temperamentally like Sardar I would have sent for you for treatment here or done some such thing.
('88', 140, 1, 9, 193261) I just do not believe that your constitution is collapsing from within and that it cannot be helped.
('88', 140, 1, 10, 193362) I believe it can be set right by nature cure.
('88', 140, 1, 11, 193408) I have said all this as I could not help it.

('88', 141, 8, 18, 195108) The Goseva Sangh is already there and the work is going on.
('88', 141, 8, 19, 195168) But the task is a difficult one.
('88', 141, 8, 20, 195201) There should be a considerable number of people who know the science of goseva and can put it into practice.
('88', 141, 8, 21, 195310) Your ideas are noble but the work will not progress on mere ideas.
('88', 141, 8, 22, 195377) I did not like the scene I witnessed the day I went there.
('88', 141, 8, 23, 195436) Everyone was sentimental but they had no knowledge and no will for work.
('88', 141, 8, 24, 195509) Try to expand the scope of the goshala.
('88', 141, 8, 25, 195549) Till now there is no tannery there.
('88', 141, 8, 26, 195585) I do not know if there is a good bull.
('88', 141, 8, 27, 195624) Do you have a dairy expert?
('88', 141, 8, 28, 195652) If there is one and if the existing institution itself becomes an ideal dairy, I shall be too glad and hope to have great results from it.
('88', 141, 8, 29, 195791) A similar experiment is going on in Wardha under my supervision.
('88', 141, 8, 30, 195856) I cannot of course cite any significant results.

('88', 142, 6, 10, 196344) Your sin is grave.
('88', 142, 6, 11, 196363) You cannot expiate it by fasting.

('88', 142, 6, 13, 196425) The real penance is a change of heart on your part.
('88', 142, 6, 14, 196477) You will have to confess your fall to the bride.
('88', 142, 6, 15, 196526) And if she still wishes to marry you, you may do so.
('88', 142, 6, 16, 196579) You must give up the bride’s mother.

('88', 144, 9, 22, 199474) I understand that we have no difficulty with the old rule.
('88', 144, 9, 23, 199533) Is this correct?

('88', 148, 1, 5, 203607) A Christian remains a full Indian because he cannot be otherwise and expects or wants no reward for remaining an Indian.
('88', 148, 1, 6, 203728) Then the word ‘minority’ loses all its significance.
('88', 148, 1, 7, 203781) I have put myself in the minorities’ position.
('88', 148, 1, 8, 203828) I can, therefore, speak with frankness and even some authority.
('88', 148, 1, 9, 203892) What does it matter, if older Christians cling to the Government and look up to it for crumbs?
('88', 148, 1, 10, 203987) That will be the testing time for the younger ones.
('88', 148, 1, 11, 204039) For time runs against the former and in favour of the latter.
('88', 148, 1, 12, 204101) If you have understood and appreciated my argument, in your private talks too you will bear down the opposition of the older ones by being and remaining true to yourselves and the nation to which you belong.

('88', 148, 8, 20, 204548) Having been the victim of such a volume myself I wonder whether you will appreciate my objection to any such volume.
('88', 148, 8, 21, 204665) Does it do any good?
('88', 148, 8, 22, 204686) Does the victim stand in need of encomium even from the tallest?
('88', 148, 8, 23, 204751) If he does, it should be withheld.
('88', 148, 8, 24, 204786) If he does not, it is superfluous.

('88', 149, 5, 10, 205566) Why did you write such a lengthy note?
('88', 149, 5, 11, 205605) Rajkumari had shown me what she had written [to you].
('88', 149, 5, 12, 205659) I still find nothing wrong in it.
('88', 149, 5, 13, 205693) Mahadev would have written a similar letter.
('88', 149, 5, 14, 205738) The estrangement between you and Satis Babu hurts me very much.
('88', 149, 5, 15, 205802) Perhaps I may not reach there on November 2 because it might be difficult to leave [ailing] Sardar.
('88', 149, 5, 16, 205902) In that case I will be delayed.
('88', 149, 5, 17, 205934) The second reason is the election excitement over there.
('88', 149, 5, 18, 205991) In view of this I will fix the date after I hear from you.
('88', 149, 5, 19, 206050) It will be better to draw up the programme there itself.
('88', 149, 5, 20, 206107) Of course it will mean some inconvenience but it would be better to put up with it.

('88', 152, 4, 5, 209113) Are you determined to die?
('88', 152, 4, 6, 209140) Convince me if there is any logic in your thinking so that I too may follow you.
('88', 152, 4, 7, 209221) Now it is high time [you listened to me].
('88', 152, 4, 8, 209263) Whoever writes, writes only about your getting weaker and weaker.
('88', 152, 4, 9, 209329) How can I make you understand?
('88', 152, 4, 10, 209360) What can I do if my going there is getting postponed?

('88', 152, 10, 16, 209567) I have your letter.
('88', 152, 10, 17, 209587) It is not as if I have known you from today.
('88', 152, 10, 18, 209632) You must act with the assumption that you are working under me and with me.
('88', 152, 10, 19, 209708) It is a different matter that your other pre occupations keep you in infrequent touch with me.
('88', 152, 10, 20, 209803) You will of course be knowing everything as the supervisor.
('88', 152, 10, 21, 209863) You will no doubt remain in touch with women.
('88', 152, 10, 22, 209909) If you find any shortcoming anywhere, you will draw my attention to them.
('88', 152, 10, 23, 209983) Then you will be able to tell me what needs to be told without any conflict and without the feeling that you are taking my time.
('88', 152, 10, 24, 210112) And yet, you will not feel burdened.
('88', 152, 10, 25, 210149) I have prepared the draft regarding your resignation 1 and sent it to Bapa.
('88', 152, 10, 26, 210225) I shall send it to you when it is returned and will release it to the press only after you pass it.
('88', 152, 10, 27, 210325) I shall prepare and send the English version also from here.
('88', 152, 10, 28, 210386) That, of course, you will not be able to see (before it is sent).

('88', 153, 6, 11, 211023) I am sorry to say that I do not read newspapers and heard about Chimur Ashti only from you.
('88', 153, 6, 12, 211115) If what you state is all true, it is a matter of great sorrow and all the more so for me that such an incident should take place over my name.
('88', 153, 6, 13, 211258) Moreover, I am totally ignorant about what is going on there at present.
('88', 153, 6, 14, 211331) I cannot personally go anywhere but I am enquiring about both the matters.
('88', 153, 6, 15, 211406) If the second incident also was as you describe, it is really sad.

('88', 153, 8, 20, 211684) It is good that you are earning something on your own.

('88', 155, 5, 15, 213926) October 15, 1945
('88', 155, 6, 16, 213943) KAKA, I got your letters.
('88', 155, 6, 17, 213969) I have already sent a brief message through Bal.

('88', 155, 6, 19, 214069) I, therefore, don’t write about them here.
('88', 155, 6, 20, 214112) I had a discussion with Deo regarding Hindustani.
('88', 155, 6, 21, 214162) His views are firm.
('88', 155, 6, 22, 214182) He adheres to every word of the Poddar Deo statement.
('88', 155, 6, 23, 214236) I showed him the whole of your letter.
('88', 155, 6, 24, 214275) He finds some factual errors in it, the chief being that he has never opposed your propagation of Hindustani.
('88', 155, 6, 25, 214385) He is not opposed to it even in thought.
('88', 155, 6, 26, 214426) He has, in fact, restrained others who were opposed to you.
('88', 155, 6, 27, 214486) He says that you or others may offer whatever opposition you wish and in whatever manner you wish.
('88', 155, 6, 28, 214585) My path, therefore, is clear.
('88', 155, 6, 29, 214615) You, I and others who regard knowledge of the two languages as essentiaI should vigorously, but in our own manner, carry on our work.
('88', 155, 6, 30, 214749) Atulanand’s 1 leaflet and other literature have been passed on to you.

('88', 156, 7, 14, 215668) MRIDULA, I have your resignation.
('88', 156, 7, 15, 215702) I think you have acted wisely in tendering it.
('88', 156, 7, 16, 215749) I know and I believe that in accepting the post of Joint Secretary your intention was to render wider service to the cause of women.
('88', 156, 7, 17, 215882) Equally good is your motive in resigning because you realized and I also saw that by continuing in that post you would not be able to realize your ideal.
('88', 156, 7, 18, 216036) There is temperamental incompatibility between Bapa and you.
('88', 156, 7, 19, 216097) You tried to adjust but who can remove inherent differences?
('88', 156, 7, 20, 216158) You saw that your method of working did not satisfy Bapa.
('88', 156, 7, 21, 216216) He, on his part, also tried to adjust but with little success.
('88', 156, 7, 22, 216279) I could see that the difference was enormous.
('88', 156, 7, 23, 216325) In my opinion neither of you is at fault.
('88', 156, 7, 24, 216367) Very often such differences are unbridgeable.
('88', 156, 7, 25, 216413) In these circumstances, the best thing is to work apart.
('88', 156, 7, 26, 216470) Bapa was, and is still, ready to quit.
('88', 156, 7, 27, 216509) But this is Bapa’s creation and Bapa is a seasoned hand in this kind of work.
('88', 156, 7, 28, 216587) It would be difficult for me, I think, to carry this burden without him.
('88', 156, 7, 29, 216660) It is Bapa’s wish and mine that all men should ultimately withdraw from the Samiti and the entire administration should be handed over to the sisters.
('88', 156, 7, 30, 216811) That will bring it real credit.
('88', 156, 7, 31, 216843) This effort will continue and none of us will rest on our oars till it succeeds.
('88', 156, 7, 32, 216924) Success will not come early by Bapa’s leaving it or allowing us to quit.
('88', 156, 7, 33, 216997) Hence I am allowing you to quit the Joint Secretaryship and am accepting your resignation.
('88', 156, 7, 34, 217088) I know that I am not losing your services thereby.
('88', 156, 7, 35, 217139) You are and will continue to be a

('88', 157, 1, 3, 217241) I am sure you will continue to work for the local Kasturba Nidhi committee of Gujarat; and you will also assist the Central Committee whenever it needs your help.
('88', 157, 1, 4, 217404) Thus I am confident that you will not lag behind in serving the Committee even when you relinquish its Joint Secretaryship.
('88', 157, 1, 5, 217528) Moreover, you should not forget that you have resigned from Secretaryship, not from trusteeship.
('88', 157, 2, 6, 217625) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] Your decision to publish the resignation letter is well conceived.
('88', 157, 2, 7, 217718) That will scotch all rumours and speculation either in private or in public.
('88', 157, 2, 8, 217795) You are already on leave.

('88', 161, 1, 4, 222623) When you and Esther came to me, it was, I think, common between us that conversion from one faith to another was needless and created heart burning.
('88', 161, 1, 5, 222772) One’s faith expands by removing the bad in it and absorbing the good and new from the others.
('88', 161, 1, 6, 222866) You have every right to hold the opposite view.
('88', 161, 1, 7, 222914) My point is simple.

('88', 162, 1, 3, 223943) Ultimately I made someone read it out.
('88', 162, 1, 4, 223982) I know from personal experience that there is a lot of difference between reading something and hearing it read.
('88', 162, 1, 5, 224095) Daily I make someone read out cuttings from newspapers and if and when I have time, I read them myself.
('88', 162, 1, 6, 224199) Sometimes when a thing is re read there is a striking change in my understanding.
('88', 162, 1, 7, 224281) I feel this must be a common experience.
('88', 162, 1, 8, 224322) Of course you have to realize yourself.
('88', 162, 1, 9, 224362) I have mentioned this important, though irrelevant, thing because I thought it worth mentioning.

('88', 162, 1, 12, 224616) I am sending back your article.
('88', 162, 1, 13, 224648) Please note the changes I have made in what I could read myself.
('88', 162, 1, 14, 224713) The changes are just from the point of view of language.
('88', 162, 1, 15, 224770) The rest I find is quite all right.
('88', 162, 1, 16, 224806) I am giving a gist of my experiences so as to make what I have said more clear.
('88', 162, 1, 17, 224886) I saw the work done by teachers trained under Madame Montessori, and carefully observed the working of the Nursery School.
('88', 162, 1, 18, 225009) Of course the things were foreign and the poor teacher had not digested what she had been taught.
('88', 162, 1, 19, 225107) What to speak of the children?
('88', 162, 1, 20, 225138) They could not even observe normal discipline.
('88', 162, 1, 21, 225185) I am not criticising anyone.
('88', 162, 1, 22, 225214) I have given the gist of my experience just for your information.
('88', 162, 1, 23, 225280) Imbibe whatever you find useful and discard the rest.
('88', 162, 1, 24, 225334) The conclusion I have drawn from this experience is that we shall be able to propagate scientific knowledge of child education only when our teachers are competent.
('88', 162, 1, 25, 225499) They should have the will to become one with children.
('88', 162, 1, 26, 225554) I am afraid I am not saying anything new in this.
('88', 162, 1, 27, 225604) These things are certainly not beyond your range of experience but since I have come to know you and also love you I hope you will not find fault with me for saying the things you already know.

('88', 163, 6, 19, 226884) But if you can give the sanction for two months, you may as well make it for three months so that the matter is settled.” I would do as you wish.
('88', 163, 6, 20, 227030) I shall make the sanction for three months if you so desire.
('88', 163, 6, 21, 227091) It appears to me that Jog has written under your persuasion.
('88', 163, 6, 22, 227152) So I take that what will fully satisfy you will also satisfy her.
('88', 163, 6, 23, 227218) I understand that what you suggest is two months’ wages.

('88', 165, 3, 4, 228918) CHHAGANLAL, I have your letter.
('88', 165, 3, 5, 228950) I remember to have written to you that I would let you accompany me during some part of my tour.
('88', 165, 3, 6, 229047) 1 My view is that it would be convenient if you accompanied me in the Madras Presidency, for I am familiar with the work there.
('88', 165, 3, 7, 229175) The work in Bengal and Assam is rather difficult.
('88', 165, 3, 8, 229225) I don’t have a clear picture of it in my mind.
('88', 165, 3, 9, 229272) I, therefore, don’t wish to take with me there anybody who is not specially needed.
('88', 165, 3, 10, 229356) The date of my tour also has not been fixed.
('88', 165, 3, 11, 229401) Perhaps I may go to Bengal only after November 21. Everything depends on Sardar’s health.
('88', 165, 3, 12, 229491) I think your accepting money from the Rulers requires some consideration.
('88', 165, 3, 13, 229565) It was your letter which made me think about this.
('88', 165, 3, 14, 229616) Shouldn’t we ponder whether or not we can accept money from Rulers who pay no attention at all to the welfare of their subjects?
('88', 165, 3, 15, 229745) When the amount of Rs. 1,000 is received, I will credit it to the account of the Harijan Sevak Sangh.
('88', 165, 3, 16, 229847) So far I have no knowledge of its being received this time.
('88', 165, 3, 17, 229907) I do not know if it has been received at the Sevagram Ashram.
('88', 165, 3, 18, 229969) Do you think the States would give any protection to the Harijans wherever they are oppressed?
('88', 165, 3, 19, 230064) Concerning joint fruitparties for Harijans and caste Hindus, do you mean any caste Hindus or only reformers like you and me?
('88', 165, 3, 20, 230189) Remind me again when you read about the date of my tour.
('88', 165, 3, 21, 230246) Rajkumari has gone to Simla.
('88', 165, 3, 22, 230275) From there she may perhaps have to go to England for a month.

('88', 166, 10, 16, 230936) Probably it was about your study, Jayaprakash and your coming.

('88', 169, 2, 3, 234299) POONA, October 18, 1945
('88', 169, 3, 4, 234323) BHAI PROFULLA, I have your letter and telegram about Jawaharlalji.
('88', 169, 3, 5, 234390) 2 I have understood the matter.
('88', 169, 3, 6, 234422) Sudhir came yesterday.
('88', 169, 3, 7, 234445) I have had long talks with Sudhir yesterday and today.
('88', 169, 3, 8, 234500) I could not send a telegram about my decision.
('88', 169, 3, 9, 234547) It would have been too long.
('88', 169, 3, 10, 234576) So I am sending this letter.
('88', 169, 3, 11, 234605) Sudhir must have sent you a brief telegram.
('88', 169, 4, 12, 234649) Taking everything into consideration I feel that at this stage you may announce this much: ‘Owing to unavoidable circums tances Gandhiji cannot come to Calcutta on the 2nd November.
('88', 169, 4, 13, 234831) As soon as the date is decided it will be announced.
('88', 169, 4, 14, 234884) It is likely that he will come in the last week of November or thereabouts.
('88', 169, 4, 15, 234960) His tour programme which has been published in the newspapers is also cancelled.
('88', 169, 4, 16, 235041) But wherever he is likely to go, the organizers will be informed so that they can make some arrangements.
('88', 169, 4, 17, 235147) No expen diture of any kind should be incurred at this stage.
('88', 169, 4, 18, 235209) Wherever he goes, his transport will have to be paid for, but that can be seen at that time only.
('88', 169, 4, 19, 235307) Gandhiji has made it clear that, health permitting, he will try his best to go to all the places he wanted to visit.
('88', 169, 4, 20, 235424) But consi dering his age and health, it is obvious that in spite of his desire to visit as many places as possible he will be able to visit only a few of them.’ You may publish this much.
('88', 169, 4, 21, 235612) Now I shall tell you what I want to do.
('88', 169, 4, 22, 235652) If possible I want to visit Midnapore, Chittagong, Dacca, Borkamta, Santiniketan and Assam.
('88', 169, 4, 23, 235744) If any other place is left out, like Feni, I would like to visit that also.
('88', 169, 4, 24, 235820) You can inform the local organizers about my programme which all of you there may decide for me.
('88', 169, 4, 25, 235917) Transport also would have to be arranged.
('88', 169, 4, 26, 235959) Do not give anything to the Press yet.
('88', 169, 4, 27, 235998) That can be done on my arrival.
('88', 169, 4, 28, 236030) It takes a little time to make the preliminary arrangements.
('88', 169, 4, 29, 236091) That is why I have suggested this.
('88', 169, 4, 30, 236126) It is for you to work out what places I can easily visit.
('88', 169, 4, 31, 236184) I don’t feel that it is necessary for me to let you know just now
('88', 169, 5, 32, 236250) 1 This was sent through Sudhir Ghosh.
('88', 169, 5, 33, 236288) 2 The addressee wanted Jawaharlal Nehru to postpone his visit to Calcutta for a longer visit later.

('88', 170, 1, 2, 236460) who will be with me.
('88', 170, 1, 3, 236481) If you want to suggest anything about this, you may do so.
('88', 170, 1, 4, 236540) I would certainly like to meet the people who have already been to see me.
('88', 170, 1, 5, 236615) If you want any more persons to meet me you may send for them.
('88', 170, 1, 6, 236678) Maulana Saheb is there in Calcutta at present.
('88', 170, 1, 7, 236725) You should not trouble him; but if he wants to suggest anything you should go to him and ask him about it.
('88', 170, 1, 8, 236832) I do not want to get involved in addresses of welcome.
('88', 170, 1, 9, 236887) Gift of any amount of self spun yarn, or yarn spun by friends, will not be too much.
('88', 170, 1, 10, 236972) My aim will be to convert it into khadi and distribute it there at the cheapest possible price.
('88', 170, 1, 11, 237068) Any gift of money will be welcome, but no special effort should be made for it.
('88', 170, 1, 12, 237148) It should be voluntary.
('88', 170, 1, 13, 237172) The money will be used for some constructive work in Bengal.
('88', 170, 1, 14, 237233) But please remember that this tour is not for the collection of either yarn or money.
('88', 170, 1, 15, 237319) I would of course like to meet Mr. Casey and try to secure from him whatever assistance can be had for the people.
('88', 170, 1, 16, 237434) It has been my experience so far that wherever I go and settle down, my presence gives the poor and destitute a sense of comfort.
('88', 170, 1, 17, 237564) If I can do even this much, I shall be satisfied.
('88', 170, 1, 18, 237614) I do not want to get involved in the politics of Bengal.
('88', 170, 1, 19, 237671) I have neither the desire nor the knowledge.
('88', 170, 1, 20, 237716) Whatever you decide in this matter should be decided unanimously by all of you, rather than by majority opinion.
('88', 170, 1, 21, 237829) This is not the kind of thing which should be settled by the majority.
('88', 170, 1, 22, 237900) If anyone interested in my proposed visit does not like a particular thing, I do not want to do that.
('88', 170, 1, 23, 238002) There must be no quarrel over my visit.
('88', 170, 1, 24, 238042) My dharma is to settle quarrels.
('88', 170, 1, 25, 238075) Please give this letter or a copy of it to Satis Babu.
('88', 170, 1, 26, 238130) My earnest wish is that even though you are two separate bodies, you should become of one mind before my arrival.
('88', 170, 1, 27, 238244) You are both eminent disciples of the same guru, a great guru like P. C. Ray 1. What I want is to see you both truly united in heart.
('88', 170, 1, 28, 238378) Both of you are doing my work.
('88', 170, 1, 29, 238409) Then why should there be any difference between the two of you?
('88', 170, 1, 30, 238473) But in all this God’s grace is the main thing.

('88', 171, 14, 26, 239582) The only course for Congress is to agree to Pakistan and forge a united front with the Mussalmans to fight for the freedom of India.
('88', 171, 14, 27, 239715) Dr. Zakir Husain said that the only man who could deliver the goods on behalf of the Hindus was Mr. Gandhi, but if he accepts the demand .

('88', 172, 7, 16, 240829) Bapa thinks and I agree that there should be an impartial statement in reply exposing the many mis statements in the book.
('88', 172, 7, 17, 240952) Bapa has prepared a reply on behalf of the Harijan Sevak Sangh which you should and will see.
('88', 172, 7, 18, 241046) Rajaji was to prepare the Congress reply but he cannot under the altered circumstances.
('88', 172, 7, 19, 241134) 2 You are the next best man and I would like you to take up the matter.
('88', 172, 7, 20, 241206) Bapa will write to you more fully.
('88', 172, 8, 21, 241241) Yours, BAPU SJT.

('88', 173, 2, 4, 241894) I can’t as yet decide the date of my journey.
('88', 173, 2, 5, 241940) It seems I shall be able to do so immediately after November 2. I write this letter just to let you have a copy of my letter to Santhanam 1 and to ask you to write more about it to him.
('88', 173, 2, 6, 242126) Send a draft of the answer you have prepared so that he can make the necessary changes and make a case for the Congress on the basis of it.
('88', 173, 2, 7, 242266) I think he will have Dr. Ambedkar’s book.
('88', 173, 2, 8, 242308) If not, write to him that you will send a copy to him.

('88', 173, 6, 18, 242713) I am still in correspondence with Champa.
('88', 173, 6, 19, 242755) She tells a different tale altogether.
('88', 173, 6, 20, 242794) Consider what your dharma in the present situation is.
('88', 173, 6, 21, 242849) You should go and take charge.
('88', 173, 6, 22, 242880) The case is a very difficult one.
('88', 173, 6, 23, 242914) Champa reports that Shashi took him 3
('88', 173, 7, 24, 242952) to his place, where he behaved sensibly for some time but lost his balance again.
('88', 173, 7, 25, 243034) You yourself should ascertain the facts and do what is necessary.
('88', 173, 7, 26, 243100) Narandas did all he could.
('88', 173, 7, 27, 243127) But matters have gone beyond anybody’s control.
('88', 173, 7, 28, 243175) There are only two who can exercise some restraint on him—you or I. I do not belong to any single human being now.
('88', 173, 7, 29, 243290) You alone, therefore, can do something.

('88', 174, 1, 2, 243611) 366. LETTER TO MANGALDAS PAKVASA
('88', 174, 2, 3, 243644) October 18, 1945
('88', 174, 3, 4, 243661) BHAI MANGALDAS PAKVASA, Many Provincial governments permit the sale of cloth under licences.
('88', 174, 3, 5, 243754) They have now amended the terms.
('88', 174, 3, 6, 243787) A copy of the amendment introduced by the C. P. Government is enclosed.
('88', 174, 3, 7, 243859) In my view a product like khadi cannot be, ought not to be, licensed.
('88', 174, 3, 8, 243929) A leading counsel in South Africa with a flourishing practice had told me that one must proceed on the assumption that every tangible wrong had a remedy in law and seareh for it, assured that it would be found.
('88', 174, 3, 9, 244140) This had appealed to me very much, and I had always relied on it in my work in South Africa and succeeded in finding the remedies.
('88', 174, 3, 10, 244271) I believe the principle is true in India, too.
('88', 174, 3, 11, 244318) I have not read all the laws, but I feel that a law which applies to a mill owner worth millions cannot apply to khadi.
('88', 174, 3, 12, 244438) If you see the definition of a ‘dealer’, you will observe that it must include ‘business’.
('88', 174, 3, 13, 244529) There is no trace of ‘business’ in khadi, for all processes relating to it merely ensure a livelihood to those who make a living through khadi.
('88', 174, 3, 14, 244673) I have alluded to this argument merely as a suggestion to you.
('88', 174, 3, 15, 244736) You will also see that the Government is empowered to grant exemption to anybody.
('88', 174, 3, 16, 244818) This is not a matter of law, as yet.
('88', 174, 3, 17, 244855) I draw your attention to it.
('88', 174, 3, 18, 244884) You may write to Jajuji for any further information which you cannot get locally.
('88', 174, 3, 19, 244966) What I want you to do is this.
('88', 174, 3, 20, 244997) Consult anybody whom you wish to and then write to the Government yourself, or request the counsel whom you consult to do so.
('88', 174, 3, 21, 245123) If, however, you feel that whatever representation is to be made should be addressed by Jajuji as Secretary, we shall do that.
('88', 174, 3, 22, 245250) Send copies to Jajuji and me of any correspondence that you have.
('88', 174, 3, 23, 245316) And if you decide to write to the Government directly from there, send the letter after showing the draft to me.
('88', 174, 3, 24, 245429) I still cherish the belief that I may be able to suggest some improvements.
('88', 174, 3, 25, 245505) We should write immediately to the Provincial Government or to the Central Government, whichever you decide.
('88', 174, 3, 26, 245614) I have already addressed 1 a communication to the Central Government as President of the Charkha Sangh.
('88', 174, 3, 27, 245718) A copy is enclosed.
('88', 174, 3, 28, 245738) I have even received an acknowledgement of the letter.
('88', 174, 3, 29, 245793) The copy is only for your information for the present.

('88', 175, 1, 3, 246038) Probably you know that by adopting such a procedure I had been able to save the Charkha Sangh during Linlithgow’s tenure.
('88', 175, 1, 4, 246160) Let us see what happens this time.
('88', 175, 1, 5, 246195) I am entrusting this important task to you relying on the assurance you have given to me, that you intend to use your ability and prestige as a lawyer, not for money but entirely for public service.
('88', 175, 1, 6, 246394) And that is what you have been doing for some time.
('88', 175, 1, 7, 246446) Isn’t that the best way for everybody to use their talents?
('88', 175, 1, 8, 246506) If you want any further information, please write to me.
('88', 175, 1, 9, 246563) The matter is urgent, since they have already started issuing licences.
('88', 175, 1, 10, 246635) I forgot about one thing.
('88', 175, 1, 11, 246661) Khadi is facing a special danger, namely, the U. P. Government’s objection to our practice of demanding yarn worth some pice from the buyers for khadi worth every rupee.
('88', 175, 1, 12, 246831) The objection seems to me ridiculous and harmful from every point of view.
('88', 175, 1, 13, 246906) However, please consider along with the other issue whether such an objection can be sustained in law.
('88', 175, 1, 14, 247009) In my view this is a secondary matter and can be easily dealt with.
('88', 175, 1, 15, 247077) The chief thing is that khadi must not be considered as falling within the scope of the licensing law.
('88', 175, 1, 16, 247180) We have even stores which sell less than 1,000 rupees worth of khadi every month.
('88', 175, 1, 17, 247262) To require a licence for sale of khadi is to put a restraint over the production of khadi, i.
('88', 175, 1, 18, 247356) e., over the poor.

('88', 178, 1, 7, 250852) The times when the sentences were pronounced were those of war when calmness was at a discount.
('88', 178, 1, 8, 250948) Now they are changed.
('88', 178, 1, 9, 250970) The war is over.

('88', 182, 4, 17, 256361) 3 You will see from Vaikunth’s letter that though the Government is collecting all literature about it, it will not start implementing it and meanwhile if suggestions are accepted, it will at any rate stop for the time being.
('88', 182, 4, 18, 256587) Of course I am pursuing it.

('88', 182, 4, 21, 256753) However, we shall await his reply.
('88', 182, 4, 22, 256788) Sardar also received a cutting.
('88', 182, 4, 23, 256820) I have taken that and passed it on to Rajkumari.
('88', 182, 4, 24, 256869) The argument about your health will take us nowhere.
('88', 182, 4, 25, 256922) I think my heart ache is also useless but one’s nature does not readily obey reason.
('88', 182, 4, 26, 257007) So I stick to my suggestion 5. .

('88', 184, 2, 3, 258707) October 19, 1945
('88', 184, 3, 4, 258724) BHAI BHAVANIDAYAL, I have your letter.
('88', 184, 3, 5, 258763) I am sorry to learn that you are not well.
('88', 184, 3, 6, 258806) Get well soon.
('88', 184, 3, 7, 258821) This is my hope as well as my wish.
('88', 184, 3, 8, 258857) It is surprising that you who know me from childhood should still fail to understand fully or to make others understand what I am doing.
('88', 184, 3, 9, 258994) Truly speaking, good work does not need anyone’s blessings because it is in itself a blessing.
('88', 184, 3, 10, 259089) That is to say, its success lies in the work itself.
('88', 184, 3, 11, 259142) Secondly, for what shall I send my blessings?
('88', 184, 3, 12, 259188) There is no reason to doubt that your aunt may be greater than all the mahatmas in her field and perhaps she is.
('88', 184, 3, 13, 259301) Moreover, she is certainly of an advanced age but it is my misfortune that I don’t know her.
('88', 184, 3, 14, 259394) In such a situation how can a man like me send blessings to her?
('88', 184, 3, 15, 259459) And where do I count among so many titled men and other bigwigs, and, pray, why should I?
('88', 184, 3, 16, 259549) When the rich take my blessings on some occasions you should take it that I know them and take service from them.
('88', 184, 3, 17, 259663) Otherwise none of the rich come to me or can get anything from me.
('88', 184, 3, 18, 259730) And what to say of the poor?
('88', 184, 3, 19, 259759) They are mine and I am theirs.
('88', 184, 3, 20, 259790) I am myself poor but if they get my blessings it is not going to appear in the newspapers.
('88', 184, 3, 21, 259881) So looking from all points of view, I cannot be a participant in your aunt’s memorial.
('88', 184, 3, 22, 259968) Those who are in it do not know me; so they can only criticize me.
('88', 184, 3, 23, 260035) What else can they do?
('88', 184, 3, 24, 260058) If people like you can convince them with love, you may do so.
('88', 184, 3, 25, 260121) What will you gain by writing to me except that I should waste my time in writing such long letters and give you the trouble of reading them even when you are not well?
('88', 184, 3, 26, 260290) I shall have done my job if I have been able to make you see the point and if I have not, I am helpless.

('88', 186, 13, 20, 262774) I am surprised at your wanting to stand for the Assembly on the Congress ticket.
('88', 186, 13, 21, 262855) I am also pained a little.
('88', 186, 13, 22, 262882) You cannot have my blessings in this matter.
('88', 186, 13, 23, 262927) Only the person who is sociable and can easily adjust with everyone, who possesses other abilities and is not fit for anything except legislative work can go to the Assembly.
('88', 186, 13, 24, 263102) There is no question of high or low.
('88', 186, 13, 25, 263139) It is a question only of fitness.

('88', 186, 14, 28, 263224) 386, 2 According to the source this was written before the letter to the addressee dated October 27, 1945. However, Gandhiji’s decision to stay on in Poona till November 2 was taken around October 19. This letter, therefore, appears to have been written some time after that.

('88', 187, 1, 3, 263624) One cannot say that therefore he is also fit for the Assembly work.
('88', 187, 1, 4, 263692) Sardar cannot be said to have recovered yet.
('88', 187, 1, 5, 263737) He has constipation.
('88', 187, 1, 6, 263758) He used to spend one and a half to two hours in the toilet.
('88', 187, 1, 7, 263818) It may be due to spasm 1 in the intestines, or the trouble may be due to some adhesions 2 inside.
('88', 187, 1, 8, 263916) The pelvic loop 3 (of the colon) is much enlarged.
('88', 187, 1, 9, 263967) He also feels cramps in the stomach.
('88', 187, 1, 10, 264004) Dinshawji believes that the greater part of the complaint he has today will disappear after three months’ treatment here.
('88', 187, 1, 11, 264126) He will complete three months on November 22. He is not accompanying me to Sevagram.
('88', 187, 1, 12, 264211) According to the present programme I shall myself go to Sevagram only for three or four days and then proceed to Bengal.
('88', 187, 1, 13, 264332) The programme may be modified.
('88', 187, 1, 14, 264363) Do write if you have any suggestions about Sardar’s treatment.
('88', 187, 1, 15, 264426) I am here at least till November 2nd.

('88', 188, 8, 17, 265520) He does not like to study.
('88', 188, 8, 18, 265547) I see that neither Abha nor Zohra has any influence on him.
('88', 188, 8, 19, 265607) Kanu looks after him a little.
('88', 188, 8, 20, 265638) Valjibhai teaches him.
('88', 188, 8, 21, 265661) He has also engaged a man to teach him tables.
('88', 188, 8, 22, 265708) I feel now that it would have been better if I had insisted on your taking him with you.
('88', 188, 8, 23, 265797) I am no good now for this kind of work.
('88', 188, 8, 24, 265837) It might be better to make some arrangement for Arun there.
('88', 188, 8, 25, 265897) My plan is hanging fire.
('88', 188, 8, 26, 265922) It seems that I shall be able to go to Sevagram after the 15th.
('88', 188, 8, 27, 265986) I think it will be difficult to leave while Sardar’s treatment is going on.
('88', 188, 8, 28, 266062) It seems Pyarelal has typhoid.
('88', 188, 8, 29, 266093) He will recover.

('88', 189, 4, 5, 266455) There is room for disappointment in expectation.
('88', 189, 4, 6, 266504) Moreover, it is a sin to entertain false hopes.
('88', 189, 4, 7, 266552) What Manibehn says is clear.
('88', 189, 4, 8, 266581) If you think that she is a sevika, that too of her ailing father, his secretary and aide, you may perhaps make changes in your article.
('88', 189, 4, 9, 266717) If you find fault with her way of answering or her voice, one can only point out that you are much older.

('88', 189, 10, 18, 267137) It is clear that only independent India can make such changes.
('88', 189, 10, 19, 267200) The best of reforms can be implemented only if approved by the people.
('88', 189, 10, 20, 267271) I am also sending Gagan Mehta’s letter to you.
('88', 189, 10, 21, 267318) Why should you do typing work?
('88', 189, 10, 22, 267349) I believe the Talimi Sangh should do it.

('88', 189, 10, 24, 267473) But that requires enthusiasm on your part or detachment like Sardar’s.
('88', 189, 10, 25, 267544) He has no faith in this system but still he is giving it a trial.

('88', 190, 1, 7, 268247) I think your going to Nagpur is futile.

('88', 193, 3, 5, 272349) Today she must have reached Delhi from Simla and will fly to Lon don tomorrow or the day after.
('88', 193, 3, 6, 272445) You did well in writing to her.
('88', 193, 3, 7, 272477) Why keep it in your heart?
('88', 193, 3, 8, 272504) Since you have written so frankly, I also have an opportunity of saying something.
('88', 193, 3, 9, 272587) Your sense of detachment should be sufficiently strong.
('88', 193, 3, 10, 272643) Explain your doubts to Prafulla Babu and listen to what he says and if he disagrees, accept his advice.
('88', 193, 3, 11, 272747) Haven’t I made it clear in the letter that I have sent through Sudhir that so long as you all do not decide unanimously and not by majority, it should not be considered as finally decided?
('88', 193, 3, 12, 272936) Still, I shall go there and decide which places I shall visit and which I may not.
('88', 193, 3, 13, 273019) I have stopped anything being sent to the newspapers.
('88', 193, 3, 14, 273073) I think this solves all the problems.

('88', 193, 6, 20, 273270) [Before October 21, 1945] 1
('88', 193, 7, 21, 273298) The meaning of the middle path is this.
('88', 193, 7, 22, 273338) If you suddenly take a liking for someone, you will not act on an impulse.
('88', 193, 7, 23, 273413) If you are used [to male company] you will not be affected by the sight of a young man.
('88', 193, 7, 24, 273501) All men are like a brother or a father to you.
('88', 193, 7, 25, 273548) If yours is an ideal mother she will also be a preceptor and guru.
('88', 193, 7, 26, 273615) She will care for you and will find a husband for you.
('88', 193, 7, 27, 273670) If your mother is not an ideal one any other person whom you have accepted as your mentor will take full care of you.
('88', 193, 7, 28, 273788) It is possible you may yourself come across a person of your liking but that will be due to your previous birth and not because of a sudden infatuation.
('88', 193, 7, 29, 273941) Even then you would like to consult your mother or your mentor and in that case it will not be a secret matter at all.
('88', 193, 7, 30, 274060) By “you” here I do not mean “Chand” but .

('88', 194, 11, 18, 274887) Your letter will be destroyed after Sushila has read it.
('88', 194, 11, 19, 274944) She is just now (9.10) away at Talegaon to see a hospital.
('88', 194, 11, 20, 275003) She will be back at 11. Your time will pass quickly and you will be with me.
('88', 194, 11, 21, 275080) Only keep well.

('88', 196, 5, 10, 277269) POONA, October 21, 1945
('88', 196, 6, 11, 277293) BHAI BHULABHAI 1, As it is difficult to decipher my handwriting, I am dictating this letter so that it can be written in a clear hand.
('88', 196, 6, 12, 277428) Sardar and I keep receiving telegrams suggesting that you should be put up as a candidate for the Central Legislative Assembly.
('88', 196, 6, 13, 277556) I myself have no interest in the elections.
('88', 196, 6, 14, 277600) A durbar daily assembles round the Sardar, but I know nothing about it.
('88', 196, 6, 15, 277672) Ordinarily he does not talk to me not do I ask him anything.
('88', 196, 6, 16, 277733) I attend to my work and he attends to his.
('88', 196, 6, 17, 277776) The only reason for our being together this time is his nature care treatment.
('88', 196, 6, 18, 277855) He does not have much faith in nature care while I have.
('88', 196, 6, 19, 277912) An operation would be a very risky affair.
('88', 196, 6, 20, 277955) No doctor except Dr. Deshmukh advises it.
('88', 196, 6, 21, 277997) That is why he has put faith in me and is undergoing nature cure treatment.
('88', 196, 6, 22, 278073) I have, accordingly, brought him to Dr. Mehta for I have faith in him.
('88', 196, 6, 23, 278144) My own knowledge of nature cure is superficial.
('88', 196, 6, 24, 278192) I have given this introduction because I thought it necessary.
('88', 196, 7, 25, 278255) If Sardar receives any suggestion regarding you, he puts it before me.
('88', 196, 7, 26, 278326) Since you have accepted my advice, I assume that you yourself are not at all keen o getting into the Central Assembly, and that, therefore, those who send the telegrams do not do so at your

('88', 197, 1, 3, 278723) Some big people naturally desire your presence in the Assembly.
('88', 197, 1, 4, 278787) If I were not there, perhaps Sardar would have yielded to the pressure.
('88', 197, 1, 5, 278859) But I am firm, for I am acting as your well wisher.
('88', 197, 1, 6, 278911) I want a big service from you, if you can give it.
('88', 197, 1, 7, 278962) I wish to see you as a people’s man.
('88', 197, 1, 8, 278999) I don’t consider you an old man.
('88', 197, 1, 9, 279032) Why shouldn’t you also live up to 125?
('88', 197, 1, 10, 279071) If you do not aspire to live that long, as I do, please remember that I try to persuade everybody to have such as piration for the sake of service.
('88', 197, 1, 11, 279219) And it is not that there is no strength or effort behind my aspiration.
('88', 197, 1, 12, 279291) If there is non and my aspiration proves fruitless, I will accept that.
('88', 197, 1, 13, 279363) I am not, therefore, afraid of death if it should come today.
('88', 197, 1, 14, 279425) But I will cherish my aspiration till my last breath, for I have to serve —I have not yet finished with service.
('88', 197, 1, 15, 279538) There is a spirit of competition to serve which all of us should share.
('88', 197, 1, 16, 279610) From this standpoint I suggest to you that you yourself should issue a graceful statement, thanking all those who are trying on your behalf, explaining that you do not wish to be a member of the Assembly at the moment and that you have been doing, and will continue to do, whatever service you can from outside, that if you live long enough and feel later that you should also enter the Legislature, you yourself will come forward and seek people’s votes.
('88', 197, 1, 17, 280066) I like the work you are doing just now of defending the prisoners.
('88', 197, 1, 18, 280133) 1 It will bring you credit.
('88', 197, 1, 19, 280161) I also wish that like Jawaharlal and Sardar, and to a great extent Maulana Azad, you too should come into contact with the masses.
('88', 197, 1, 20, 280292) Perhaps I should cite Rajendra Babu’s case as offering the best example.
('88', 197, 1, 21, 280365) Rajendra Babu is sought after by Bihar, he himself does not go seeking the support of Bihar.
('88', 197, 1, 22, 280458) I can cite other similar instances, too.
('88', 197, 1, 23, 280499) But where is the need to do so for you?
('88', 197, 1, 24, 280539) Even what I have written above seems to me too long, but I cannot restrain my Moha 2. If desire also could be described as sattvika 3, I am sure this desire of mine is that and, therefore, I need not hide it.
('88', 197, 1, 25, 280748) I trust you are well and succeeding in your efforts.

('88', 198, 2, 5, 281414) I would like to go a little further.
('88', 198, 2, 6, 281451) Khadi is a symbol of truth and ahimsa.
('88', 198, 2, 7, 281490) It should not subsist on the mercy of the Government.
('88', 198, 2, 8, 281544) It will be a different thing altogether if khadi is adopted deliberately after its real strength is realized.
('88', 198, 2, 9, 281654) The shortage of cloth will then be easily removed.
('88', 198, 2, 10, 281705) We can even have swaraj by non violent means and thereby bring credit to ourselves and to our Government.
('88', 198, 2, 11, 281811) Sooner or later that will come but how soon it will come, depends on the public acceptance of the new plan.
('88', 198, 2, 12, 281919) I do know that a time may come when we may even have to suspend the sale of khadi in our shops.

('88', 198, 2, 14, 282049) From that point of view Jajuji’s article is a preliminary and an essential move.

('88', 199, 3, 9, 283081) And it must issue from the heart, not from the mouth.

('88', 201, 7, 15, 286193) If your food habits and ventilation are taken care of nothing should happen to you.

('88', 201, 12, 23, 286485) Now have you declared me not guilty?
('88', 201, 12, 24, 286522) A man cannot become an inmate of the Ashram just because he appreciates the elevenfold vow 2 or knows all the Shastras and is acquainted with the constructive programme.
('88', 201, 12, 25, 286692) But one certainly becomes such by observing the vows.
('88', 201, 12, 26, 286746) It seems you have not been able to see that constructive programme is included in the observance of the vows.

('88', 202, 10, 23, 288248) I have my doubts if going there will be beneficial.

('88', 202, 10, 25, 288348) Madalasa would like it, too.

('88', 203, 7, 17, 289140) There should indeed be no indiscipline.
('88', 203, 7, 18, 289180) And from where can they get money, etc., if they want to have a maternity centre and other things without permission?
('88', 203, 7, 19, 289298) We cannot say anything if they themselves collect the amount for it.
('88', 203, 7, 20, 289367) Moreover, haven’t I said that wherever people are willing to work, we allow them to do so by issuing a circular to that effect?

('88', 207, 1, 3, 294546) Now having heard everything from Akka 1, I feel that you are no longer in a position to do so.
('88', 207, 1, 4, 294641) Naturally you have to take care of Akka and also look after your other daughters and manage their affairs.
('88', 207, 1, 5, 294748) You have to support your wife.
('88', 207, 1, 6, 294779) If you do not, who else will?
('88', 207, 1, 7, 294809) So it is the duty of people like you to give primary importance to the family responsibilities and devote to public service only as much time as you can after that.
('88', 207, 1, 8, 294974) One who shoulders the burden of the family as dharma also renders service.
('88', 207, 1, 9, 295049) One must clearly distinguish between family responsibility and family enjoyment.
('88', 207, 1, 10, 295130) You have long since given up indulgence.
('88', 207, 1, 11, 295171) Why should I discuss these things at length?
('88', 207, 1, 12, 295216) You should be able to understand them from what I have already said.
('88', 207, 1, 13, 295285) It should be clear enough that if you do not abide by what I have said the result will be quite to the contrary of what it should be.
('88', 207, 1, 14, 295419) I cannot say what I had in mind when I wrote “I cannot give” [answers to your other questions].
('88', 207, 1, 15, 295515) And what will you gain by thinking over it again and again?
('88', 207, 1, 16, 295575) If I was short of time, I should have said that I would reply to the other questions some other time.
('88', 207, 1, 17, 295677) At any rate, I was quite clear in my mind when I sent a letter 2 through Akka that I should tell you what according to me your dharma was without bothering you about other things.
('88', 207, 1, 18, 295857) Now the question arises only if you are not able to understand and approve of my stand.
('88', 207, 1, 19, 295945) You can discuss this letter with Vinoba and Kishorelal.
('88', 207, 1, 20, 296001) Of course also with Dhotre 3 and other relatives there.

('88', 208, 6, 9, 296872) I really wish I had enough time to write Urdu in a beautiful hand.

('88', 208, 6, 11, 297025) Of course work is always there but sometimes rest is essential for work and for doing more of it.

('88', 211, 3, 7, 300640) Kanu has the greatest influence over him.
('88', 211, 3, 8, 300682) He and others also told him.
('88', 211, 3, 9, 300711) But he remained stubborn.

('88', 211, 3, 15, 300998) He has no interest at all in study, but has plenty in playing and cycling.
('88', 211, 3, 16, 301073) Whatever is possible will have to be done only here.
('88', 211, 3, 17, 301126) Arun himself is quite happy.
('88', 211, 3, 18, 301155) He studies a little, but very little.
('88', 211, 3, 19, 301193) For all this backwardness I hold you, his mother, most responsible, since I have always believed you to be wise.
('88', 211, 3, 20, 301306) If Arun remains a dullard, I will surely regard you as stupid.
('88', 211, 3, 21, 301369) May you all spend a happy Diwali.
('88', 211, 3, 22, 301403) Reserve a share for us all in your happiness.
('88', 211, 3, 23, 301449) “Us all” includes all of us here and the dumb, poor millions of India.
('88', 211, 3, 24, 301520) Those who do not remember them even on the Diwali day, their Diwali, according to me, is worse than Holi.

('88', 213, 13, 23, 304462) Your Hindi is not bad but it may be inadequate to express your thoughts.
('88', 213, 13, 24, 304535) Mine is also imperfect but the very idea of writing to Indians in English pains me.
('88', 213, 13, 25, 304619) Moreover, I will not agree that you can truly express your thoughts or feelings in English.
('88', 213, 13, 26, 304711) Maybe, you think otherwise.

('88', 214, 5, 13, 305360) BAPA, I had the circular you wanted to issue about the women village workers I don’t remember now why I did not give then the approval asked for.
('88', 214, 5, 14, 305506) I am sorry there has been this delay.
('88', 214, 5, 15, 305544) I have carefully gone through it.
('88', 214, 5, 16, 305578) Do circulate it.
('88', 214, 5, 17, 305595) Satyabhama Devi’s donation should be accepted if the Pro vincial Committee can make use of it and no burden falls on us.
('88', 214, 5, 18, 305716) I take it that the correspondence, etc., will be put in order.
('88', 214, 5, 19, 305779) The idea of training midwives through the Kamala Nehru Hospital 2 is good.
('88', 214, 5, 20, 305854) It is commendable that facilities are made available by the Hospital.
('88', 214, 5, 21, 305924) But I have my doubts about the utility of such midwives as they will not be able to serve in villages.
('88', 214, 5, 22, 306027) Since our committee is going to meet now the matter will be decided withoutany delay.
('88', 214, 5, 23, 306113) It had, therefore, better be postponed till then.
('88', 214, 5, 24, 306163) I hope to reach Wardha on the 21st.

('88', 216, 9, 13, 308350) He is surprised to hear from you that Shri Kamaraj and Shri Bhaktavatsalam used his name to persuade you to stand for election.
('88', 216, 9, 14, 308478) He had said nothing of the kind to them.
('88', 216, 9, 15, 308519) In the company of others they came to see him and enquire about his health as he was under the same roof as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
('88', 216, 9, 16, 308653) Dr. Pattabhi who led them pointedly remarked that they had only come on a friendly visit as they knew he took no interest in elections, and as a matter of fact during the few minutes that they were with him there was no talk about the elections.

('88', 218, 8, 14, 310636) GHANSHYAMDAS, I have had Jehangir Patel’s 1 letter.
('88', 218, 8, 15, 310688) He also writes that only the school building would be suitable.
('88', 218, 8, 16, 310752) There should be some more facilities there.
('88', 218, 8, 17, 310796) There should also be provision for electricity and water.
('88', 218, 8, 18, 310854) Dinshaw suggests going straight into the school building when everything is ready.
('88', 218, 8, 19, 310937) In that case it will take nine months.
('88', 218, 8, 20, 310976) I favour moving at once into the sanatorium building and starting work there, and later shifting to the school building when it is ready.
('88', 218, 8, 21, 311114) Whether this is possible or not has to be decided by you people.
('88', 218, 8, 22, 311179) In the sanatorium building also more pipes will be required for water.
('88', 218, 8, 23, 311250) Maybe, something will have to be done about electricity too.
('88', 218, 8, 24, 311311) Water treatment requires plenty of water.
('88', 218, 8, 25, 311353) I see some difficulty in taking the school building.
('88', 218, 8, 26, 311406) If the school is to be housed there, it will be difficult to run two institutions in the same building.
('88', 218, 8, 27, 311510) If my idea takes shape, even the present building may not be enough.
('88', 218, 8, 28, 311579) For, my idea is that the poor also have to be admitted and I shall be interested in running nature cure clinics for them, too.
('88', 218, 8, 29, 311706) It seems to me that from the school building it would also be possible to serve the village people as I have planned to do.
('88', 218, 8, 30, 311830) Think over all this and let me know what you feel would be best to do.
('88', 218, 8, 31, 311901) Let me also give you Sardar’s view.

('88', 219, 1, 2, 312047) interest myself in this work to this extent.
('88', 219, 1, 3, 312092) If Dinshaw requires financial help I should have it provided to him and then stop at it.
('88', 219, 1, 4, 312181) In going further at the moment there is a risk of Dinshaw breaking down or my being disappointed and the great affection which Dinshaw is showing for me today coming to an end.
('88', 219, 1, 5, 312358) I have no such fear.
('88', 219, 1, 6, 312379) In my opinion Dinshaw can break down, but his affection for me cannot wane.
('88', 219, 1, 7, 312455) I know that he had the same affection for me even when no question of money was involved and when I did not even know him.
('88', 219, 1, 8, 312578) But Sardar understands human nature and he has too much consideration for me; so I think it is as well to place his view before you so that you may decide the question objectively.
('88', 219, 1, 9, 312759) Please do not think that just because I have been given assurance about Nasik no other alternative should be considered.
('88', 219, 1, 10, 312880) Nature cure work is of great importance.
('88', 219, 1, 11, 312921) If carried on well it can have far reaching results the scope of which can hardly be envisaged today.
('88', 219, 1, 12, 313023) It must also be considered to what extent Dinshaw can fit into this set up.
('88', 219, 1, 13, 313099) If you think it necessary to see me before taking any decision in the matter and if you can find some time, come and talk it over.
('88', 219, 1, 14, 313230) But if the matter can be settled through correspondence, you need not come.
('88', 219, 1, 15, 313306) In spite of my great interest in this work you should take it that I am acting in a detached way.
('88', 219, 1, 16, 313404) If I am to live for 125 years, there is also this condition that my sense of objectivity, that is, non attachment should increase day by day and approximate as much to perfection as is humanly possible.
('88', 219, 1, 17, 313607) I do not know how this can happen or whether it will happen at all.
('88', 219, 1, 18, 313675) Why should I even wish to know?
('88', 219, 1, 19, 313707) Let me keep that ideal in view and do what I consider to be my duty.
('88', 219, 1, 20, 313776) I know this much that it is difficult to reach that ideal.

('88', 220, 6, 16, 314804) There is no doubt that the people resented and rose against the hasty and wholesale arrests 3. The civil disobedience movement could only be started by me.
('88', 220, 6, 17, 314960) I never started it.
('88', 220, 6, 18, 314980) In some cases people lost self control.
('88', 220, 6, 19, 315020) But the Government[’s] senseless violence eclipsed all popular violence.
('88', 220, 6, 20, 315093) To accuse Rajaji of betrayal is not to know him.
('88', 220, 6, 21, 315142) He is too good to do anything mean.

('88', 221, 5, 13, 316316) Unfortunately, Congress monopoly tacitly recognized by all is broken.
('88', 221, 5, 14, 316386) But if the Congress is challenged I suppose the Congress will say we are the only real servants of labour.
('88', 221, 5, 15, 316493) Who will establish the claim finally is in the womb of time.
('88', 221, 5, 16, 316554) My participation in the affairs of the Working Committee is very slight and, I fancy, growing slighter.
('88', 221, 5, 17, 316658) Therefore, don’t expect me to do anything in the matter of the flag designed by you.
('88', 221, 5, 18, 316743) 3. SWEEPERS.
('88', 221, 5, 19, 316756) You and a few others may recognize my claim to be the first sweeper, but I will cut a sorry figure in a sweepers’ conference.
('88', 221, 5, 20, 316882) The so called sweepers will themselves repudiate my claim as many do.
('88', 221, 5, 21, 316952) My sympathy will be with them in such repudiation.
('88', 221, 5, 22, 317003) The fortunate position of a self styled man, however, is that he does not require any outside recognition of a style adopted by himself.
('88', 221, 5, 23, 317140) Therefore, I must not bear the burden of having the conference even when the choice of the venue is left to me.
('88', 221, 5, 24, 317252) What is more, I have neither the time nor the wish to carry more burdens than I have.
('88', 221, 5, 25, 317338) You should therefore go on without counting on my service even in the way of a message.
('88', 221, 5, 26, 317426) Cultivate the belief that every bonafide service carries with it its own recognition.
('88', 221, 6, 27, 317512) 1 Gandhiji had started writing the Key to Health on August 27, 1942, during his incarceration in the Aga Khan Palace and completed it on December 18, 1942. The Gujarati original was translated into Hindustani and English by Sushila Nayyar under Gandhiji’s guidance.

('88', 221, 6, 29, 317876) These were later published in the form of a booklet under the title A Guide to Health.

('88', 222, 1, 2, 318008) 4. MATERNITY HOME.
('88', 222, 1, 3, 318027) Are you not principally dependent upon Government grant and recognition?
('88', 222, 1, 4, 318100) The record you mention is certainly very good but it loses in public dignity and value.
('88', 222, 1, 5, 318188) No Gov ernment or Government aided institution suffers for want of funds.
('88', 222, 1, 6, 318262) All are crowded, some even to suffocation.
('88', 222, 1, 7, 318305) Whether they really serve the needy poor is a separate question.
('88', 222, 1, 8, 318370) This criticism is independent of the fact that I have to ask you to be merciful and excuse me from the obligation you seek to impose on me.
('88', 222, 1, 9, 318510) If I do succeed in visiting Madras for the Hindustani Prachar Sabha, I must ask friends who know me to extend to me their co operation by imposing upon themselves restraint in the way of saving me from further burdens.
('88', 222, 1, 10, 318729) 5. “UP FROM SLAVERY”: I would love to write a line on this.
('88', 222, 1, 11, 318789) But seeing that you have waited all these years I would ask you to wait a little longer and remind me when I have settled down after the tours I have in mind.

('88', 222, 6, 18, 319174) Send him a cable, saying, ‘Bapu unable send message.’ The pre paid form also is enclosed, so that you may use it.
('88', 222, 6, 19, 319288) Send the reply immediately.
('88', 222, 6, 20, 319316) Arun is quite happy.
('88', 222, 6, 21, 319337) The rest is going on well.
('88', 222, 6, 22, 319364) Sardar has left on business, accompanied by Dinshaw.
('88', 222, 6, 23, 319417) Both will return on the 1st.
('88', 222, 6, 24, 319446) My work is going on very well.

('88', 223, 3, 4, 319875) KISHORELAL, It would be very good indeed if Gomati completely recovers.
('88', 223, 3, 5, 319947) She is as strong as you.
('88', 223, 3, 6, 319972) She has the strength to bear any amount [of pain].
('88', 223, 3, 7, 320023) But [“those who are in it enjoy rare happiness] the spectators are scorched”.
('88', 223, 4, 8, 320101) Whenever I am consulted about an abhinandan granth 2, I always oppose the suggestion.
('88', 223, 4, 9, 320187) So I will oppose it regarding Kakasaheb also.
('88', 223, 4, 10, 320233) You too should do the same.
('88', 223, 4, 11, 320261) I am going to say the same thing about Nathuram Premi.
('88', 223, 4, 12, 320316) I think this is a sort of mania.
('88', 223, 4, 13, 320349) I don’t feel like writing to Ranka 3. From your suggestion I take it that Sardar will write to him.
('88', 223, 4, 14, 320449) Don’t trust what the newspapers say.
('88', 223, 4, 15, 320486) I am not going to stay in Poona.
('88', 223, 4, 16, 320519) It will be a different thing if I have to come here to help Dinshaw.

('88', 223, 8, 24, 320820) Your dharma is to admit that you yourself are suffering from illusion instead of saying that others have turned against you.
('88', 223, 8, 25, 320945) You should not go to any shop or ask for money and spend it.
('88', 223, 8, 26, 321006) If you lose your temper all the time, you had better leave the Ashram.
('88', 223, 8, 27, 321077) Come here if you feel like it.
('88', 223, 8, 28, 321108) You are not in a position to go to the Himalayas.
('88', 223, 8, 29, 321158) Your place is either near your father or near me.

('88', 224, 7, 15, 321981) Your brother is gone.
('88', 224, 7, 16, 322003) From the empirical view it is only natural that you should grieve, but if you take the transcendental view, the integral view, what is there to grieve over in death?
('88', 224, 7, 17, 322169) What is there to rejoice over in birth?
('88', 224, 7, 18, 322209) These two go together, one must follow the other and the two are inseparably linked.
('88', 224, 7, 19, 322294) Hence at least to you death should cause no sorrow.
('88', 224, 7, 20, 322346) You have an added reason for devoting yourself to your duty.
('88', 224, 7, 21, 322407) It is all the more regrettable that you thought of going into the Assembly at the suggestion of your deceased brother.
('88', 224, 7, 22, 322526) About Gadodiaji, if you stick to everything [you have said] write to me point by point as 1, 2, 3. I am willing to send them to him.
('88', 224, 7, 23, 322659) I shall also suggest that they should be placed before an arbitrator.
('88', 224, 7, 24, 322729) These should cover all the complaints you had made to me.
('88', 224, 7, 25, 322787) The decision about other things may well depend on it, though now I must confess I have my suspicions.
('88', 224, 7, 26, 322890) I cannot write anything about Sardar because he and Dinshawji are in Bombay.
('88', 224, 7, 27, 322967) They will return on the 1st.

('88', 227, 3, 12, 326451) It will do so readily if it appreciates the fact that some, among whom I count myself, render greater help by refraining from signing anything like your resolution but working silently and probably effectively.

('88', 227, 3, 14, 326804) It may interest and even please you to know that I have enforced in my own life now for years your ‘ten don’ts’ 2 andinvited my neighbours to do likewise for I have long believed that there is a ‘spirit in the wood’, using the word ‘wood’ in a double sense.

('88', 228, 2, 4, 328365) I have not studied the question of primary education in Travancore so as to satisfy myself, and I observe that many persons of note have expressed emphatic views one way or the other.

('88', 228, 2, 9, 328728) But neither takes any interest in public matters.
('88', 228, 2, 10, 328778) It is fraud upon the public to put such ignorant persons on the platform and make them repeat things parrot like, leading the public to believe that some good work has been done.
('88', 228, 2, 11, 328957) I felt sorry when I first heard that my sister had been dragged out of her merited obscurity in which she was happy and contented.
('88', 228, 2, 12, 329088) She has now come to me being on her way back to Rajkot.
('88', 228, 2, 13, 329144) She tells me that she had not the slightest intention of going to a meeting or sending her daughter.
('88', 228, 2, 14, 329245) She allowed herself to be tempted to go to Rameshwaram as a point of pilgrimage.
('88', 228, 2, 15, 329326) She had intended also to remain obscure and not let the people know that she was my sister.
('88', 228, 2, 16, 329418) If she had asked me I would have dissuaded her even from going to Rameshwaram, for I have no faith in these pilgrimages except under certain conditions.
('88', 228, 2, 17, 329571) But what is done cannot be undone.
('88', 228, 2, 18, 329606) I would how ever like you to give me your version of the story, so that I can have full facts enabling me to come to a right judgment, for I do not want to do yo any injustice by making up my mind on insufficient data.
('88', 228, 2, 19, 329825) Please therefore enlighten me.
('88', 228, 2, 20, 329856) And who was the party who wrote out the speech that my sister’s daughter read without understanding it?

('88', 229, 2, 3, 330212) October 28, 1945
('88', 229, 3, 4, 330229) BHAI DAHYALAL, Don’t be angry with me but have a hearty laugh.
('88', 229, 3, 5, 330292) I don’t know who told me or where I read it or what happened but somehow I had the illusion that you had died.
('88', 229, 3, 6, 330403) Later one day when I saw Kishorelal revising your translation of the Gita, I came to know that you were alive and I was happy about it.
('88', 229, 3, 7, 330539) But I forgot about this and thought you were dead.
('88', 229, 3, 8, 330590) Meanwhile yesterday your letter came and now this won’t leave my mind.
('88', 229, 3, 9, 330661) So now you have to live long.
('88', 229, 3, 10, 330691) But l know that you may live beyond me, that is, you may live for more than 125 years, and yet will remain what you are now.
('88', 229, 3, 11, 330816) Isn’t that as good as being dead even when alive?
('88', 229, 3, 12, 330866) This is the impression I have got after reading your letter.
('88', 229, 3, 13, 330927) There is nothing new in what you have said about the five things.
('88', 229, 3, 14, 330993) Of course, there is some truth in it but according to me it is so full of ignorance that I have not found any one of them useful.
('88', 229, 3, 15, 331123) Your last sentence is: “If there is any service that I can do, do order me.” How incorrect this sentence is!
('88', 229, 3, 16, 331232) I did order you to do a lot of service and what did I get from it?
('88', 229, 3, 17, 331299) What could the country achieve or what benefit did you get?
('88', 229, 3, 18, 331359) Think over the other four things in the same way.
('88', 229, 3, 19, 331409) There is no need for a reply and this should not be published on anyaccount.
('88', 229, 3, 20, 331486) I have written this just to humour you in the hope that it may open your eyes one day.
('88', 229, 3, 21, 331573) If any time you are able to understand the hidden meaning behind it I would think it is better than getting your reply and would consider your living meaningful.

('88', 230, 1, 5, 332356) The question of her salary does not arise at the moment.
('88', 230, 1, 6, 332413) The thing is we have to see whether we can have her as Joint Secretary with Sucheta, and whether she can stay in Bajajwadi.
('88', 230, 1, 7, 332537) We have also to find out whether Sucheta will agree to have a Joint Secretary.
('88', 230, 1, 8, 332616) If you appr ove of these suggestions, then we shall have to consult Sucheta.
('88', 230, 1, 9, 332693) If you concur, I shall refer the matter to her.

('88', 232, 4, 11, 335988) Though I can have nothing in common with any defence by force of arms, I am never blind to the valour and patriotism often displayed by persons in arms, as seems to be the case here.
('88', 232, 4, 12, 336171) And can the Government afford to ignore the almost, if not the wholly, unanimous opinion of Indians of all shades of opinion?
('88', 232, 4, 13, 336297) India adores these men who are on their trial.
('88', 232, 4, 14, 336344) No doubt theGovernment have overwhelming might on their side.
('88', 232, 4, 15, 336406) But it will be misuse of that power if it is used in the teeth of universal Indian opposition.

('88', 233, 3, 4, 337378) DEAR SIR EVAN, In continuation of my letter 1 of October 10, 1945, about khadi being licensed, may I add that the Privy Council had to consider the question of exempting the A.I.S.A. from the income tax.
('88', 233, 3, 5, 337582) The case is reported in A. I. R. 1944 Privy Council at p.
('88', 233, 3, 6, 337640) 88. His Excellency’s predecessor had at my request ordered that the collection of the tax be suspended, pending decision of the Privy Council.
('88', 233, 3, 7, 337783) 2 It reversed the decision of the Bombay High Court and expressed the opinion that the primary object of the Association is the relief of the poor, that its objects include the advancement of other purposes of general public utility and that the making of a commercial or private profit is not the purpose of the Association.
('88', 233, 3, 8, 338109) On these grounds they came to the conclusion that the Association is a charitable and philanthropic body and entitled to exemption from tax.
('88', 233, 3, 9, 338250) Can khadi manufactured and sold on behalf of the manufacturers—the profits, if any, going to the hand spinners and handloom weavers—be classed with mill cloth under the Anti Profiteering and Hoarding Regulations?
('88', 233, 3, 10, 338463) In my humbleopinion, it should be wholly exempt from such control, if the meagre earnings of the poor concerned are not to be taxed.

('88', 238, 3, 5, 344676) Its full execution means complete independence.
('88', 238, 3, 6, 344724) But so long as the millions of India do not take to it, Parliamentary programme will remain as a supplement.
('88', 238, 3, 7, 344833) 2. The method of enrolment of Congress membership has been useful and Congress has been able to do a lot of good work.
('88', 238, 3, 8, 344952) But many defects have crept in.
('88', 238, 3, 9, 344984) Therefore, in future the Congress will consist of workers or servants of the nation only.
('88', 238, 3, 10, 345074) Any man or woman above the age of sixteen can become a Congress worker, provided he or she is a habitual wearer of khadi certified by the A.I.S.A. and pays a monthly fee of 1,920 rounds of handspun yarn to the Congress.
('88', 238, 3, 11, 345294) The spinners should be conversant with all the processes from picking cotton pods from the field to the point of making slivers and producing yarn.
('88', 238, 3, 12, 345442) They should also know how to put a spinning wheel in order.

('88', 238, 3, 16, 345955) These shall form the Village Congress Committee.
('88', 238, 3, 17, 346004) (c) He shall keep a record of his work from day to day.
('88', 238, 3, 18, 346060) (d) It is possible that obstacles might be placed in his way by the Government or by the villagers themselves.
('88', 238, 3, 19, 346171) He shall fight all difficulties by truthful and non violent action even though he might perish in the attempt.
('88', 238, 3, 20, 346282) (e) He shall organize the villages so as to make them self contained and self supporting through their agriculture and handicrafts, treating the manufacture of Khadi as the centre, in accordance with the lines laid down by the A.I.S.A., A.I.V.I.A. and the Goseva Sangh.

('88', 239, 1, 4, 347028) (h) For the above purposes and others to be added from time to time by the Congress, he shall train and fit himself for the due performance of duty, in accordance with the rules laid down by the Congress for time to time.
('88', 239, 1, 5, 347250) 4. The Congress shall take part in the elections in all Goverment managed or controlled institutions, beginning with the Village Panchayat to the Central Legislative Assembly and Council.
('88', 239, 1, 6, 347438) 5. The Congress shall contact all those who are on the Government’s voters’ list, and (a) will give them an idea of their duties and their rights, (b) shall produce the necessary literature for their education, (c) shall make arrangements to impart literacy to the illiterate amongst them.
('88', 239, 1, 7, 347728) (d) shall see that those whose names are missing on the Government registers are duly entered therein.
('88', 239, 1, 8, 347831) (e) shall encourage those who are legally unqualified for the franchise to acquire the necessary qualifications for getting the right.
('88', 239, 1, 9, 347966) (f) shall carry on agitation for adult franchise for all inhabitants of India who are not proved lunatics or otherwise unfit workers.
('88', 239, 1, 10, 348100) 6. Out of the existing workers the Congress shall maintain a Central Board of volunteers whose sole and special duty will be to reach help to and protect, in accordance with Truth and Non violence, the people in cases of rioting, stealing, robbery and like emergencies.
('88', 239, 1, 11, 348370) To this end the Congress shall conduct a teaching institution.
('88', 239, 1, 12, 348433) 7. The Congress shall run a Languages School so as to enable Congressmen and women to learn the national language (i.e., Hindustani spoken by the villagers–Hindus, Muslims and others in the villages of the North and written in the Nagari or Urdu script) and other Indian languages.
('88', 239, 1, 13, 348715) This work is to be done along the lines of the Hindustani Prachar Sabha and Bharatiya Bhawan.

('88', 240, 4, 7, 349605) I am becoming more and more convinced that the four anna membership should go.
('88', 240, 4, 8, 349684) The membership of the Congress should be forty crores, the whole of the population, no matter to what sect, religion or province or state or the so called independent possessions a particular individual belongs.
('88', 240, 4, 9, 349896) The members have an equal right with all to service by the Congress organization.
('88', 240, 4, 10, 349978) These forty crore members will exercise no privilege by reason of their recognition as such by the Congress.
('88', 240, 4, 11, 350087) The organization will be worked by those who are habitual wearers of khaddar one year before the date of commencement, who have renounced untouchability in all its forms and who are not dealers in foreign cloth or intoxicants, who have full belief in the constructive programme of the Congress and who are prepared and willing to do work referred to in Schedule A hereto and who have passed a probation period of six months in doing that work.

('88', 244, 13, 19, 354940) CHHAGANLAL, I have your letter.
('88', 244, 13, 20, 354972) While I was talking to Narandas about the money from the States, he promptly said, “Certainly stop it if you wish to.” Now we shall think over it when we meet.
('88', 244, 13, 21, 355132) I have received the money from Wankaner.
('88', 244, 13, 22, 355173) I shall send it to you as I received it—in two instalments and under insured cover.

('88', 244, 13, 25, 355353) I don’t approve of the condition laid down by him.
('88', 244, 13, 26, 355404) How can we have a trust for such a small amount?
('88', 244, 13, 27, 355453) Why does he not have faith in an institution like the Harijan Sevak Sangh?
('88', 244, 13, 28, 355528) And why all this fuss about making a trust?
('88', 244, 13, 29, 355572) He can give the shares to Harijan Sevak Sangh on condition that the money received from the shares will be utilized as decided by the Sangh for the Harijans of Sorath.
('88', 244, 13, 30, 355740) I also believe that if we can get more money by selling the

('88', 245, 1, 3, 355892) Think over this and discuss this with Tryambaklal if you wish to.

('88', 246, 3, 6, 357579) How can one do without an index in a book on a serious subject?
('88', 246, 3, 7, 357643) You must find a helper who would prepare the index.
('88', 246, 3, 8, 357695) I know you have written novels, too, and may still be writing more.
('88', 246, 3, 9, 357763) I can understand not having an index there.

('88', 246, 13, 29, 358575) You have laboured very hard.
('88', 246, 13, 30, 358604) What for ?
('88', 246, 13, 31, 358615) With me you could have been brief because I do not any more have to try
('88', 247, 0, 1, 358687) 248 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('88', 247, 1, 2, 358729) and understand you.
('88', 247, 1, 3, 358749) Or do I have to understand you further ?
('88', 247, 1, 4, 358790) I hope I can understand from your slightest hint.
('88', 247, 1, 5, 358840) There is one thing you must do.
('88', 247, 1, 6, 358872) What can there be personal with people like us ?
('88', 247, 1, 7, 358921) Are you any more an individual ?
('88', 247, 1, 8, 358954) If you continue to be an individual, it is not for writing personal things, but to preserve your individuality, which is done only when you reduce yourself to a zero and remain a zero.
('88', 247, 1, 9, 359139) If you do not know this, then follow my exeprience if you can.
('88', 247, 1, 10, 359202) Where there is ‘I’, there is individuality.
('88', 247, 1, 11, 359246) It is only when ‘I’ is eliminated, that individuality ceases to exist.
('88', 247, 1, 12, 359317) Take the letter ‘I’ of the English alphabet.
('88', 247, 1, 13, 359362) So long as it is straight, it appears like a scare crow.
('88', 247, 1, 14, 359419) If it wants to efface itself and realize its individuality it must turn itself into a cipher.
('88', 247, 1, 15, 359513) This is philosophy.
('88', 247, 1, 16, 359533) But you will see what I mean.
('88', 247, 1, 17, 359563) I can understand your views about Bapa.
('88', 247, 1, 18, 359603) Our experiences with him have been different.
('88', 247, 1, 19, 359649) Only time will show whose experience is right.
('88', 247, 1, 20, 359696) I am under no misconception that my experience being longer is right and your experience being shorter is worng.
('88', 247, 1, 21, 359809) I know that even a long experience can be wrong.
('88', 247, 1, 22, 359858) We shall weigh our experiences on the scales of time.
('88', 247, 1, 23, 359912) Kanu agrees that what I have written to the Kasturba Nidhi about Bapa is correct, because Thakkar Bapa was instrumental in this.
('88', 247, 1, 24, 360041) Had he not involved himself, the matter would not have gone any further.
('88', 247, 1, 25, 360114) And Narandas is always clinging to him.
('88', 247, 1, 26, 360154) He would like to continue to work through him as before and be satisfied.
('88', 247, 1, 27, 360228) His idea assumed the gigantic size it did only after Thakkar Bapa joined in.
('88', 247, 1, 28, 360305) Afterwards others too played a major role.
('88', 247, 1, 29, 360348) That in my opinion is a remarkable thing about Bapa.
('88', 247, 1, 30, 360401) He starts something and lets someone else take the credit.
('88', 247, 1, 31, 360460) He has shortcomings, no doubt.
('88', 247, 1, 32, 360491) Who does not have them ?
('88', 247, 1, 33, 360516) But in my view, his faults have become insignificant in the face of his good qualities.
('88', 247, 1, 34, 360604) I wish you too would recognize this some day.
('88', 247, 1, 35, 360650) I am writing to Bapa to pay Lila Jog for three months.

('88', 250, 4, 10, 364221) —Nanak July 20, 1945 Truth can be found by searching within, never through argument or disputation.
('88', 250, 4, 11, 364321) It is just the same if for ‘Truth’ one reads ‘God’.
('88', 250, 4, 12, 364373) July 21, 1945 Nanak says: “God dwells in every human heart, and so every heart is a temple of God.” July 22, 1945 If God resides in every heart, then who dare hate whom?
('88', 250, 4, 13, 364543) July 23, 1945 Nanak says: “If we obey the law of God, we then need no man made laws.” July 24, 1945 Nanak says: “God has ordained that all of us in this world itself are one family and each of us has to live for others,” July 25, 1945 The darkness of egoism is more impenetrable than darkness itself.

('88', 251, 1, 2, 365028) July 26, 1945 How shall we dispel this darkness of egoism?
('88', 251, 1, 3, 365087) By the light of uttermost humility.
('88', 251, 1, 4, 365123) July 27, 1945 Sorrow is but another aspect of joy.
('88', 251, 1, 5, 365174) Hence the one invariably follows the other.
('88', 251, 1, 6, 365218) July 28, 1945 Just as joy and sorrow are a pair that follow each other, in succession, so is the case with all things in life.
('88', 251, 1, 7, 365345) Consequently, to have real peace of mind, we must rise above such pairs of opposites.
('88', 251, 1, 8, 365431) July 29, 1945 How can he who realizes not the true value of the Self, nor is able to protect it, protect anything else in life?
('88', 251, 1, 9, 365559) July 30, 1945 Even one word, if true, is enough.
('88', 251, 1, 10, 365608) Untrue words, however many, are worth nothing.
('88', 251, 1, 11, 365655) July 31, 1945 The power of a true word is such that it leads one from selfishness to selflessness.
('88', 251, 1, 12, 365754) August 1, 1945 He alone lives in whose heart dwells Rama (God) and who is ever aware of such presence.
('88', 251, 1, 13, 365857) August 2, 1945 Real knowledge cannot be acquired by mere reading of the scriptures.
('88', 251, 1, 14, 365941) Indeed, it is difficult of attainment without the practice of virtue.
('88', 251, 1, 15, 366011) August 3, 1945 One can never find Truth if one is not wide awake every moment of one’s life.
('88', 251, 1, 16, 366104) August 4, 1945 There can be no such thing as rights for a satyagrahi.
('88', 251, 1, 17, 366174) For him there is only one right—the right to serve.
('88', 251, 1, 18, 366226) August 5, 1945 Therefore, a satyagrahi will never seek rights; these will come to him unsought.
('88', 251, 1, 19, 366322) August 6, 1945 Even one drop of the poison of untruth will poison the entire milk ocean of Truth.
('88', 252, 0, 1, 366420) VOL.88: 30 AUGUST, 1945 6 DECEMBER, 1945 253
('88', 252, 1, 2, 366465) August 7, 1945 Nanak says: “Man is born of woman as woman is born of man.” Then, why is it that we find sexual immorality in the world?
('88', 252, 1, 3, 366601) August 8, 1945 Nanak lay in the open under the sky.
('88', 252, 1, 4, 366653) A kind hearted householder suggested to him, “There is a beautiful dharmsala nearby.
('88', 252, 1, 5, 366738) Why not go there?” Nanak replied: “The whole earth is my dharmsala and the sky is its roof.” August 9, 1945 Nanak says: “The craving for happiness is a veritable disease.
('88', 252, 1, 6, 366909) Sorrow or suffering is its remedy.” August 10, 1945 Says Nanak again: “Whatever you give away is yours; whatever you keep is not yours.” August 11, 1945 Whatever we take, we are snatching from the mouths of others.
('88', 252, 1, 7, 367124) Therefore, whenever we acquire anything, let us see that it is really needed and that our wants are as few as possible.
('88', 252, 1, 8, 367244) August 12, 1945 Nanak says: “He who earns his bread by the sweat of his brow and shares with others what he so earns, can be called truly honest.” August 13, 1945 Nanak says: “The more one indulges oneself, the more unhappy one becomes.” August 14, 1945 St. Catherine of Italy had no money with her.
('88', 252, 1, 9, 367544) She had only a cloak which she was wearing.
('88', 252, 1, 10, 367588) A destitute asked for it and she gave it away.
('88', 252, 1, 11, 367635) Someone, thereupon, asked her: “How will you go about now?” She replied: “The raiment of love will cover me far more securely than the cloak.” August 15, 1945 Money alone can keep memory green—how much harm this false notion has done!
('88', 252, 1, 12, 367870) This thought occurs to me today on the anniversary of Mahadev [Desai].
('88', 252, 1, 13, 367941) August 16, 1945 Nanak says: “Dreams are evidence of the fact that the atma (soul) uses the senses as its instruments.
('88', 252, 1, 14, 368059) But it is only when the atma
('88', 253, 0, 1, 368088) 254 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('88', 253, 1, 2, 368130) keeps the senses under control that they become its instruments, and the atma then becomes ripe for union with the Paramatma.” August 17, 1945 The pangs of hunger are not relieved by filling the stomach.
('88', 253, 1, 3, 368334) They can be overcome by taking a limited quantity of food, like medicine, and remaining content with it.
('88', 253, 1, 4, 368439) August 18, 1945 Fear vanishes only with the annihilation of the ego.
('88', 253, 1, 5, 368508) August 19, 1945 It is an ordeal nowadays to read the newspapers.
('88', 253, 1, 6, 368573) They do not give correct news.
('88', 253, 1, 7, 368604) Nothing would be lost by not reading them.
('88', 253, 1, 8, 368647) August 20, 1945 It is as difficult to make the impossible possible, as it is easy to make the possible impossible.
('88', 253, 1, 9, 368762) August 21, 1945 What seems impossible is not always really so.
('88', 253, 1, 10, 368825) August 22, 1945 One person has God on his side; millions have Satan on theirs.
('88', 253, 1, 11, 368904) Must, therefore, one fear the millions?
('88', 253, 1, 12, 368944) August 23, 1945 Supposing God is on the side of both, then who should fear whom?
('88', 253, 1, 13, 369025) August 24, 1945 He who remembers God can afford to forget everything else.
('88', 253, 1, 14, 369100) August 25, 1945 He who remembers everything else but forgets God, really remembers nothing.
('88', 253, 1, 15, 369192) August 26, 1945 He who forgets God, forgets himself.
('88', 253, 1, 16, 369245) August 27, 1945 If there is a soul, then surely the Supreme Soul (God), too, exists.
('88', 253, 1, 17, 369330) August 28, 1945 Because of our physical limitations, we cannot have a conception of the existence of God.

('88', 254, 1, 2, 369481) August 29, 1945 How can one believe in Truth if one has no belief in nonviolence?
('88', 254, 1, 3, 369563) If non violence is not put into practice, Truth, too, cannot be.
('88', 254, 1, 4, 369628) August 30, 1945 Why would one who is capable of violence for gaining his ends, hesitate to resort to untruth in both speech and action?
('88', 254, 1, 5, 369764) August 31, 1945 There are some things which a man does by word of mouth, some by observing silence, and yet others by action.
('88', 254, 1, 6, 369890) If all that he does is informed with knowledge, it is action indeed.
('88', 254, 1, 7, 369959) September 1, 1945 Never should we make the mistake of imagining that a wrong can be classified as ‘big’ or ‘small’.
('88', 254, 1, 8, 370075) September 2, 1945 One man commits a theft, another aids and abets it, while the third only harbours the intention to commit it.
('88', 254, 1, 9, 370203) All the three are thieves.
('88', 254, 1, 10, 370230) September 3, 1945 ‘What I do is a minor lapse; what others do are major lapses’— one who thinks like this lives in abysmal ignorance.
('88', 254, 1, 11, 370364) September 4, 1945 He who does something wrong out of a false sense of shame is guilty of a twofold wrong and will not be able to stand up before God.
('88', 254, 1, 12, 370514) September 5, 1945 He who thinks, speaks and acts with God as his witness, will never feel ashamed of doing the right thing.
('88', 254, 1, 13, 370638) September 6, 1945 A man who believes whole heartedly in something, even if it be absolutely improper, for him it shall be right and proper.
('88', 254, 1, 14, 370778) September 7, 1945 He who doubts the existence of God perishes.
('88', 254, 1, 15, 370841) September 8, 1945 He who denies the existence of God denies his own.
('88', 254, 1, 16, 370910) September 9, 1945 A man who behaves like a beast is worse than the beast; bestiality is natural for the beast, not so for the man.
('88', 255, 0, 1, 371041) 256 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('88', 255, 1, 2, 371083) September 10, 1945 Woman is not helpless.
('88', 255, 1, 3, 371125) She must never regard herself as weaker than man.
('88', 255, 1, 4, 371175) She should not, therefore, beg for any man’s mercy, nor depend on him.
('88', 255, 1, 5, 371246) September 11, 1945 Everyone, prince or pauper, is the guardian of his own dharma.
('88', 255, 1, 6, 371328) What is there to grieve or rejoice in this?
('88', 255, 1, 7, 371372) September 12, 1945 How strange that a man very often does not know who is a friend and who is a foe!
('88', 255, 1, 8, 371473) September 13, 1945 Belittling one’s mother tongue is like disparaging one’s own mother.
('88', 255, 1, 9, 371561) September 14, 1945 Who can make him take a lower seat who has chosen to sit on the ground?
('88', 255, 1, 10, 371652) Likewise, who can make him a servant who has himself become the servant of all?
('88', 255, 1, 11, 371732) September 15, 1945 When a man gives way to anger, he only harms himself.
('88', 255, 1, 12, 371805) The truth of this is borne out by daily experience.
('88', 255, 1, 13, 371857) September 16, 1945 Life becomes perpetually renewed every day.
('88', 255, 1, 14, 371920) This knowledge should be helpful in uplifting us.
('88', 255, 1, 15, 371970) September 17, 1945 Happiness eludes us if we run after it.
('88', 255, 1, 16, 372029) In fact happiness comes only from within.
('88', 255, 1, 17, 372071) It is not a commodity to be bought from outside.
('88', 255, 1, 18, 372120) September 18, 1945 It is a moot point as to how far a man should go with his comrades when he knows that they really no longer walk with him in spirit.
('88', 255, 1, 19, 372272) September 19, 1945 He alone can be said to have conquered anger who is not angry even when there is a cause for anger.
('88', 255, 1, 20, 372391) September 20, 1945 Conquest of anger does not mean that anger is not outwardly manifest while the heart is full of it.
('88', 255, 1, 21, 372510) Deliberately casting out anger root and branch, constitutes real conquest.

('88', 256, 1, 3, 372702) Anger, too, can bring it on.
('88', 256, 1, 4, 372731) September 22, 1945 It is far easier to conquer others than to conquer oneself because the former can be attained by recourse to outside means while the latter can be achieved only with one’s own mind.
('88', 256, 1, 5, 372932) September 23, 1945 Religion is no religion if it becomes mechanical.

('88', 256, 1, 7, 373105) It is not like a garment.
('88', 256, 1, 8, 373131) September 25, 1945 ‘Money is God’—it is wrong to say so, and it has been proved to be wrong.
('88', 256, 1, 9, 373224) September 26, 1945 Flout one rule and all rules are flouted, for they all have one basis—breach of any rule is a breach of self control.
('88', 256, 1, 10, 373361) September 27, 1945 All human activity is or should be directed towards the realization of the self.
('88', 256, 1, 11, 373461) And in this self realization lies hidden God realization.
('88', 256, 1, 12, 373519) September 28, 1945 Man cannot worship God and at the same time despise his fellow beings.
('88', 256, 1, 13, 373609) The two are irreconcilable.
('88', 256, 1, 14, 373637) September 29, 1945 Man is truly known by the humility of his spirit.

('88', 256, 1, 17, 373813) October 1, 1945 Knowledge is that alone which enables a man to know himself.
('88', 256, 1, 18, 373890) In other words, knowledge means self realization.
('88', 256, 1, 19, 373940) October 2, 1945 “Kind and generous though [the man of God] is to the sorrow stricken, his mind is not touched with pride.” If it is God who inspires all our actions, then what place has self pride?

('88', 257, 1, 10, 374912) October 11, 1945 One test of non attachment is that a man, on retiring to bed with Ramanama on his lips, falls asleep in a moment.
('88', 257, 1, 11, 375043) October 12, 1945 Narasinha Mehta says: “To say ‘I do this’ and ‘I do that’ is the height of ignorance.” The key to non attachment lies in the contemplation of this truth.
('88', 257, 1, 12, 375214) October 13, 1945 It is possible to endure a diseased body, but not a diseased mind.
('88', 257, 1, 13, 375298) October 14, 1945 What greater meanness can there be than to seek out our good points and praise them to others?

('88', 258, 1, 4, 375744) October 17, 1945 To mistake selfishness for selflessness is like mistaking a jackal for a lion.
('88', 258, 1, 5, 375840) October 18, 1945 The saying that “distance lends enchantment to the view” is apt not only in the case of hills, but also in that of most other things in life.
('88', 258, 1, 6, 375999) October 19, 1945 Purity is tested only when it is pitted against impurity.

('88', 258, 1, 12, 376332) They cannot be genuine otherwise.
('88', 258, 1, 13, 376366) October 23, 1945 Justice needs to be tempered with generosity as much as generosity needs to be tempered with justice.

('88', 258, 1, 18, 376840) October 27, 1945 Religion is not religion if it expects others to follow it.
('88', 258, 1, 19, 376917) For example, the religion of ahimsa (non violence) can manifest itself only in the face of himsa (violence).

('88', 259, 9, 15, 377827) Arun 1 has written.
('88', 259, 9, 16, 377847) I talked to him and so did Kanu 2 and Abha 3, but he refuses to budge.
('88', 259, 9, 17, 377918) I showed him your letter despite your wish to the contrary, for I did not wish to stop him if he showed the slightest desire.

('88', 262, 10, 17, 381396) These days while I spin I have a friend read out to me some book which I think is worth reading.
('88', 262, 10, 18, 381493) I am disappointed with your book.
('88', 262, 10, 19, 381527) From what you had said I had expected that I would learn something new from it and at the same time some light would be thrown on the Hindu Muslim question.
('88', 262, 10, 20, 381684) Right from my childhood I have lived with Muslims and when I went to London Providence placed me in close association with Christians, Muslims and Parsis.
('88', 262, 10, 21, 381839) Hindus of course were there.
('88', 262, 10, 22, 381868) I came into contact with the intellectuals among them and that is how I read the holy books of all the four religions.
('88', 262, 10, 23, 381987) I came to the conclusion that we could know the true facts about any religion only after reading its sacred books.
('88', 262, 10, 24, 382102) I also read quite a few criticisms of them.
('88', 262, 10, 25, 382146) I can say that I have also read the Muslim critics you mention in your letter.
('88', 262, 10, 26, 382225) I had a talk with Muslims in South Africa about those books and also with an Englishman who had become Muslim.
('88', 262, 10, 27, 382336) After coming here I read the works of Maulana Shibli.
('88', 262, 10, 28, 382390) As a result I have realized that every religion contains both truth and untruth.

('88', 266, 2, 3, 387560) NATURE CURE CLINIC, POONA, November 2, 1945
('88', 266, 3, 4, 387604) MY DEAR BHARATAN,
('88', 266, 4, 5, 387622) I had your letter yesterday.
('88', 266, 4, 6, 387651) You have given a cautious and judicious opinion on Bhailal’s 1
('88', 266, 5, 7, 387714) project.
('88', 266, 5, 8, 387723) That is not what I wanted exactly from you.
('88', 266, 5, 9, 387767) Did I tell you that I lent him your book 2 in typescript, which you gave me to read for my foreword, and he cock suredly told me that his scheme was exactly in conformity with your thesis?
('88', 266, 5, 10, 387956) I said to him, and I repeat it now, that if I have understood your thesis correctly, his project is quite contrary to the letter and the spirit of your thesis.
('88', 266, 5, 11, 388116) The rule of thumb that I applied was to know whether his scheme would succeed if it was multiplied to the extent of covering 700,000 villages.
('88', 266, 5, 12, 388259) And my answer was it could not succeed within a measurable distance of time.
('88', 266, 5, 13, 388336) This fundamental objection is apart from the fact that he, a tried engineer and therefore an accurate man, has dared to build his scheme largely on his calculation that people will do this and that and the other thing will come true.
('88', 266, 5, 14, 388570) If what I have said is true and really flows from your book, as it does from my instinctive belief, you have to say so in black and white.
('88', 266, 5, 15, 388709) If my argument is sound, the way to amend your opinion is to supplement what you have given already by adding that, according to your book as interpreted by you, the project is bound to fail in terms of the millions, and is likely to fail even within the limited compass, because he has built largely upon speculations, a thing which a tried engineer should never do.
('88', 266, 5, 16, 389077) Did you also notice that his project contemplates a mill 3 split up into fragments, owned by the villagers or one intelligent villager?
('88', 266, 5, 17, 389213) Just think what it means.
('88', 266, 5, 18, 389239) It must resolve itself into one gigantic State owned mill or mills centrally situated.
('88', 266, 5, 19, 389326) In other words, 700,000 villages must be converted into 700 or 70 cities.
('88', 266, 5, 20, 389400) In still other words, a large portion of the population must die of starvation, famine and the like or be cut to pieces by the sword or

('88', 267, 5, 12, 390216) In this manner I heard the whole of your speech at the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan 1. I liked what you said regarding my resignation.
('88', 267, 5, 13, 390345) 2 I was glad, too, that you had firmly expressed your views regarding the national language.
('88', 267, 5, 14, 390438) But I feel that what you have said about writers is not correct.
('88', 267, 5, 15, 390503) I would let the thing pass if the views expressed were not harmful.
('88', 267, 5, 16, 390571) If I have not heard right, please correct me.
('88', 267, 5, 17, 390617) I have understood your view to be this: that if a writer can make his art interesting he has fulfilled himself.
('88', 267, 5, 18, 390729) It has always seemed to me a terrible thought that the end of art is for it to be made interesting.
('88', 267, 5, 19, 390829) Leaving aside debauchery, even hypocrisy, violence and untruth can easily be made interesting.
('88', 267, 5, 20, 390924) Would such writing be called art?
('88', 267, 5, 21, 390958) On your recommendation I read Prithivivallabh 3. According to me it owes its popularity not to the interest it sustains but to the meaning it contains.
('88', 267, 5, 22, 391110) Besides, you have beautifully blended the beautiful languages descended from Sanskrit.
('88', 267, 5, 23, 391197) But, as you have not been able to forget that history 4, can you, as a historian, forget the whole of Muslim history?
('88', 267, 5, 24, 391315) Even if you can do so, can you make the whole of India forget it?
('88', 267, 5, 25, 391381) Can you reverse the flow of water and make it go upward?

('88', 268, 1, 3, 392029) I have placed these two ideas before you with some hesitation, for I do not regard myself either as an expert on art or as a student of history.
('88', 268, 1, 4, 392174) I, however, felt it was my duty to place before you the experience I have gained as, with my eyes open, I have wandered around the world.
('88', 268, 1, 5, 392312) I realize, of course, that the principle which I have followed in this very letter in welcoming your views regarding the national language might equally well apply to your ideas on these two subjects.
('88', 268, 1, 6, 392513) I liked your Press statement correcting the article which appeared in The Chronicle.
('88', 268, 1, 7, 392598) I had been considering asking you about it, when I read your reply.

('88', 268, 3, 11, 392796) 527. LETTER TO NARAHARI D. PARIKH
('88', 268, 4, 12, 392830) November 2, 1945
('88', 268, 5, 13, 392847) NARAHARI,
('88', 268, 6, 14, 392857) Your questions are very good.
('88', 268, 6, 15, 392887) This much is clear to me: whether public institutions have members of different religious persuasions or not, members belonging to the majority communities cannot celebrate their festivals in a manner which would hurt the religious sentiments of others.
('88', 268, 6, 16, 393141) The Ganapati festival, and such others, are entirely of a political character and have nothing to do with religion.
('88', 268, 6, 17, 393257) We cannot, therefore, celebrate them.
('88', 268, 6, 18, 393295) But celebrations which are part of religious practice must be observed.
('88', 268, 6, 19, 393367) For instance, in the Ashram Imam Saheb used to give, at my instance and request, the call to the faithful and we used to pray.
('88', 268, 6, 20, 393494) The call is an essential practice in Islam.
('88', 268, 6, 21, 393538) It is believed to be superior to the Church bell of the Christians.
('88', 268, 6, 22, 393606) I think I have now answered your question regarding public institutions.
('88', 268, 6, 23, 393679) If I have left out any point, please ask again.
('88', 268, 6, 24, 393727) It is not easy to answer the question what should be done now regarding Hindu practices.
('88', 268, 6, 25, 393816) It is very easy for me to describe what I myself do.
('88', 268, 6, 26, 393869) And I am also quite clear in my mind about the correctness of what I do.
('88', 268, 6, 27, 393942) But I am not so clear how far the Hindu community should go or which reforms to advocate even in the face
('88', 269, 0, 1, 394048) 270 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('88', 269, 1, 2, 394090) of opposition from it.
('88', 269, 1, 3, 394113) Probably Kishorelal remembers—as I do, if I am not imagining it—that he had once suggested the omission from our prayers of the verses referring to Ganapati, Saraswati and the Earth.
('88', 269, 1, 4, 394296) I could not accept this.
('88', 269, 1, 5, 394321) I know that the form of Saraswati described in the verse is purely imaginary.
('88', 269, 1, 6, 394399) The Ganapati also is an imaginary figure and stands merely for “Aum”.
('88', 269, 1, 7, 394469) But the popular beliefs about both take the descriptions literally; hence we have the images of Saraswati and Ganapati.
('88', 269, 1, 8, 394589) If, therefore, we were to eliminate all these practices, Hinduism would be transformed into something quite different; it would, you might say, take the form of the Arya Samaj.
('88', 269, 1, 9, 394766) There is much in the Arya Samaj that I love, but I just cannot accept Satyarthaprakash as scripture.
('88', 269, 1, 10, 394867) Dayananda Saraswati was a great man and he believed in what he preached.
('88', 269, 1, 11, 394940) He did, therefore, make an impact.
('88', 269, 1, 12, 394975) Hinduism, it seems to me, is already assimilating all that is good in the Arya Samaj, and this is the distinctive feature of Hinduism.
('88', 269, 1, 13, 395110) I do not wish to go, or take you, into still deeper waters just now.
('88', 269, 1, 14, 395179) If I am destined to live up to 125 years or for many more years still and if my non attachment becomes as deep as I wish it to become, my views will become clearer and firmer and I will also find a language that appeals to the heart.
('88', 269, 1, 15, 395413) Till that time arrives, be content with this prosaic explanation that I have given.
('88', 269, 1, 16, 395497) I have of course always expressed, and will continue to express, random views from time to time as occasion demands.
('88', 269, 1, 17, 395614) And this will some day lead—if it is so destined—to perfect clearness.
('88', 269, 1, 18, 395685) At present my attitude is, neti, neti 1. You may derive what comfort you can from this.
('88', 269, 1, 19, 395773) I am unhappy that I am not able to answer your questions as clearly as you have put them.
('88', 269, 1, 20, 395863) I have stated my view regarding the Ganapati festival.
('88', 269, 1, 21, 395918) I will add this: 1. Wherever there is a Ganapati temple, the arati, etc., should continue to be performed for the present.
('88', 269, 1, 22, 396041) There is room for reform in the arati and the ceremonial.
('88', 269, 1, 23, 396099) The arati as it is performed at present is crude.
('88', 269, 1, 24, 396149) There is no music in it.
('88', 269, 1, 25, 396174) It can easily be made musical and sweet to the ear.
('88', 269, 1, 26, 396226) The ceremonial also can be made more solemn by employing a better priest.
('88', 269, 1, 27, 396300) 2. There is no religion at all in the Dussehra celebration.
('88', 269, 1, 28, 396360) Its only sanction is custom.
('88', 269, 1, 29, 396389) I have always been opposed to it since my childhood.
('88', 269, 1, 30, 396442) Even if we wish to equip the people with arms, the Dussehra celebration has no meaning.
('88', 269, 1, 31, 396530) Instead of worship of arms, the people, including even children, should be taught the use of arms, as is

('88', 270, 1, 2, 396705) done in the West.
('88', 270, 1, 3, 396723) 3. Plying the charkha on the Charkha Jayanti Day amounts to ceremonial worship of it.
('88', 270, 1, 4, 396809) To introduce into it a ritual is to bring the charkha into disrepute.
('88', 270, 1, 5, 396879) If you ask me why, when they spin, I permit them to have a lamp with ghee during broad daylight, my answer will be that in a large measure it is due to my sense of tolerance, also to my weakness.
('88', 270, 1, 6, 397075) I have always opposed the ceremonial worship of the Gita or the manner in which Gita Jayanti is celebrated at present.
('88', 270, 1, 7, 397194) I have also forbidden the composing of a hymn in praise of the Gita to be recited on the Gita Jayanti Day.
('88', 270, 1, 8, 397301) 4. I do not approve of any leader’s photograph being worshipped or of arati being performed in front of it, but I have not always opposed these things publicly though I did oppose them in my mind.
('88', 270, 1, 9, 397498) Since such worship of human beings runs in the blood of Hindus, I have remained indifferent to them.
('88', 270, 1, 10, 397599) In this matter I am the greatest culprit, as it is the worship of my image that has become most widespread.
('88', 270, 1, 11, 397707) Since it cannot be prevented, do what I will, I derived a kind of false consolation when the worship of other leaders also started.
('88', 270, 1, 12, 397839) This, of course, does not mitigate my guilt.
('88', 270, 1, 13, 397884) It is very difficult to say where this thing will take us.
('88', 270, 1, 14, 397943) There is some basis of truth in this practice, namely, that man himself being, in a sense, an image, he will always remain an image worshipper.
('88', 270, 1, 15, 398087) The forms of such worship will vary for different faiths, but in essence the thing remains image worship.
('88', 270, 1, 16, 398193) 5. You may be sure I am opposed to the practice of inviting Brahmins and breaking a coconut at a foundation stone laying.
('88', 270, 1, 17, 398315) And yet I have tolerated this.
('88', 270, 1, 18, 398346) But since the time I learnt to regard all of us as belonging to one class, namely, the Atishudras, all these rituals have taken a different form in my mind.
('88', 270, 1, 19, 398503) The new form 1 was first put to use on the occasion of the marriage of Tendulkar and Indu.
('88', 270, 1, 20, 398594) It is a long time since then, but I have seen no defect in the practice.
('88', 270, 1, 21, 398667) On the day itself the new form seemed very impressive indeed.
('88', 270, 1, 22, 398729) Vanu 2 is getting along very well.
('88', 270, 1, 23, 398764) If the clinic 3 continues in existence, she will complete one full year here.
('88', 270, 1, 24, 398842) She will lose nothing.
('88', 270, 1, 25, 398865) On the contrary, I believe she will gain something.
('88', 270, 1, 26, 398917) I do feel sorry that I am not able to give her as much attention as I should like to but my preoccupations have become so serious even here and I have to husband my time so

('88', 272, 9, 18, 401453) KAILAS,
('88', 272, 10, 19, 401461) I have your letter.
('88', 272, 10, 20, 401481) I must admit that I am disappointed in you.
('88', 272, 10, 21, 401525) Prabhudas praised you sky high.
('88', 272, 10, 22, 401557) I literally believed him and strongly recommended to the secretary of the Ashram that you be admitted, but you did not prove worthy of that praise.
('88', 272, 10, 23, 401705) You caused anxiety.
('88', 272, 10, 24, 401725) It will be good if you have settled down even now.
('88', 272, 10, 25, 401776) Prabhudas’s mother is almost an invalid, though she has her wits about her.
('88', 272, 10, 26, 401852) His father is bed ridden.
('88', 272, 10, 27, 401878) If you had remained there as his daughter how much less I should have had to worry?
('88', 272, 10, 28, 401962) As long as you do not cultivate true devotion to service, as long as you have not controlled your palate and have not learnt to treat all children as your own, I do not see how you can do justice to the kindergarten.
('88', 272, 10, 29, 402179) It is more difficult to run a kindergarten than to run a school for grown up children.
('88', 272, 10, 30, 402266) Very few realize this.
('88', 272, 10, 31, 402289) Kindergartens are the vogue these days.
('88', 272, 10, 32, 402329) ‘What is there in teaching the children?’ There are many who nurture such ignorance.
('88', 272, 10, 33, 402414) I hope you are not a victim of it.
('88', 272, 10, 34, 402449) This letter is not to dissuade you from gaining some kindergarten experience but I feel it would be desirable if you served Kashibehn to supplement your experience.

('88', 273, 1, 8, 403009) Your Gujarati handwriting also invites comment.
('88', 273, 1, 9, 403057) Even your own signature is not well formed.

('88', 274, 3, 4, 404194) BHAI RAMNARAYAN DUBE,
('88', 274, 4, 5, 404216) I have your letter.
('88', 274, 4, 6, 404236) It is all right that you are sending your book but please give up the thought of dedicating it to me.
('88', 274, 4, 7, 404338) If the book has power, that itself will be true dedication.
('88', 274, 4, 8, 404398) I cannot say that I shall be able to read your book carefully.
('88', 274, 4, 9, 404461) May be it will arouse my interest when I glance through it.

('88', 274, 9, 16, 404787) Mahuva is said to be a health resort.
('88', 274, 9, 17, 404825) The harbour therefore should suit you.
('88', 274, 9, 18, 404864) I have an impression that there are facilities for education in Mahuva.
('88', 274, 9, 19, 404936) At one time Dudhabhai was running a school for Harijans there and the attendance too was pretty good.
('88', 274, 9, 20, 405038) Find out and tell me whether it still continues.
('88', 274, 9, 21, 405087) You have gone to a place where there is much scope for service.
('88', 274, 9, 22, 405151) The people there are bigoted.
('88', 274, 9, 23, 405181) Hence very few wear khadi.
('88', 274, 9, 24, 405208) You may find an odd person here and there wearing it.
('88', 274, 9, 25, 405262) It is as good as a virgin field.
('88', 274, 9, 26, 405295) Besides, being an important part of the State, we can see its influence.
('88', 274, 9, 27, 405368) Do as much as you can and keep writing to me.

('88', 275, 4, 10, 405954) 535. THE CHARKHA SANGH AND POLITICS
('88', 275, 5, 11, 405990) A khadi worker has sent the above letter 1 to Jajuji, Secretary of the Charkha Sangh.
('88', 275, 5, 12, 406076) He has forwarded it to me to discuss it in Khadi Jagat and to give my opinion on it.
('88', 275, 5, 13, 406161) The Charkha Sangh is not a small organization.
('88', 275, 5, 14, 406208) Even today the workers or the servants—whatever you call them—of the Sangh are to be found all over India.
('88', 275, 5, 15, 406315) Their number is about 3,000. I consider this a small number.
('88', 275, 5, 16, 406376) Their number should increase considerably when khadi spreads in the country.
('88', 275, 5, 17, 406453) Even if we have one worker for every village, the number of workers on the rolls of the Charkha Sangh should be 700,000. This requires a lot of money.
('88', 275, 5, 18, 406604) But from this one should not conclude that it is impossible to have so many workers.
('88', 275, 5, 19, 406689) I have never believed that.
('88', 275, 5, 20, 406717) When the cause is good and there is a spirit of service among the workers the money is always found.
('88', 275, 5, 21, 406818) I have founded and conducted insitutions all my life.
('88', 275, 5, 22, 406872) In my experience there has not been a single institution which was closed down or which could not make progress for want of money.
('88', 275, 5, 23, 407003) On the contrary I have found that some institutions ceased functioning or could not make progress for want of workers.
('88', 275, 5, 24, 407122) You should not ask how, if not on the strength of money, big factories function and recruitment to the Government offices is made.
('88', 275, 5, 25, 407253) Those who do not understand fully what I have said above, raise such doubts.
('88', 275, 5, 26, 407330) I never said that money could serve no purpose.
('88', 275, 5, 27, 407378) If money served no purpose how could we have become its slaves?
('88', 275, 5, 28, 407442) I would go to the extent of saying that without money we cannot go ahead.
('88', 275, 5, 29, 407516) But what I want to say is that if we want to become slaves of money we should give up the
('88', 275, 6, 30, 407606) 1 Not reproduced here.
('88', 275, 6, 31, 407629) The correspondent had suggested that workers of the Charkha Sangh might be permitted to take part in the election activities in their spare time.

('88', 276, 1, 2, 407821) idea of serving the people.
('88', 276, 1, 3, 407849) And it is the lot of slaves to be suppressed.
('88', 276, 1, 4, 407895) If however we consider money as our slave and use it as a means and that too for rendering service, then we are making good use of it.
('88', 276, 1, 5, 408030) For the work of service, our first and indispensable need is workers and when we have such workers money will come chasing them.
('88', 276, 1, 6, 408159) They will not have to go in search of money.
('88', 276, 1, 7, 408204) That is why I say if we get seven lakh or even more workers we may take it as though we had the money in the safe.
('88', 276, 1, 8, 408319) It may be said that we do not pay enough to tempt or attract workers.
('88', 276, 1, 9, 408389) I admit it.
('88', 276, 1, 10, 408401) But it is only the spirit that matters.
('88', 276, 1, 11, 408441) Those who join such philanthropic institutions as the Charkha Sangh do so for the sake of service and not for salaries.
('88', 276, 1, 12, 408561) They do take monthly salaries because like the rich the poor too have to feed themselves, but they do so only to keep themselves alive and fit for service.
('88', 276, 1, 13, 408717) Such workers do not eat or drink or dress merely for pleasure.
('88', 276, 1, 14, 408780) If we assume that such are the workers of the Charkha Sangh then they do not have any time to take part in politics.
('88', 276, 1, 15, 408897) The Charkha Sangh cannot function at all if the workers devote eight hours to office work and spend the rest of thetime in pleasure or otherwise.
('88', 276, 1, 16, 409043) Because they are the people who will make or mar the Sangh.
('88', 276, 1, 17, 409103) Therefore they should devote their spare time to making themselves more competent for improving its activities, such as learning all the processes of khadi making, studying its science, and doing well all that they do.
('88', 276, 1, 18, 409322) This does not mean that the workers of the Charkha Sangh have no interest in politics or other activities.
('88', 276, 1, 19, 409429) They are and should be interested in such activities.
('88', 276, 1, 20, 409483) However, they should keep that interest in check and give expression to it through their work in the Charkha Sangh.
('88', 276, 1, 21, 409599) Then only can they understand true politics.
('88', 276, 1, 22, 409644) A Charkha Sangh worker will remain a true voter and will vote for the candidate put up by the Congress but he will not bother to canvass for him.
('88', 276, 1, 23, 409790) He will not deliver speeches supporting him.
('88', 276, 1, 24, 409835) He will not devote his time to such work.
('88', 276, 1, 25, 409877) Congress work is peoples’ work.
('88', 276, 1, 26, 409909) The Congress belongs to the people.
('88', 276, 1, 27, 409945) The Charkha Sangh has been created by the Congress and the Charkha Sangh also belongs to the people.
('88', 276, 1, 28, 410046) Just as political work is Congress work the Sangh work is also Congress work.
('88', 276, 1, 29, 410124) How can a man ride two horses at the same time?
('88', 276, 1, 30, 410172) One who joins the Charkha Sangh should devote himself wholly to its activities and one who joins politics should devote his entire time to politics.
('88', 276, 1, 31, 410321) In this way both supplement each other’s work.
('88', 276, 1, 32, 410368) What I said above is at the back of the
('88', 277, 0, 1, 410408) 278 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('88', 277, 1, 2, 410450) rule that the workers of Charkha Sangh should not take active part in politics.

('88', 277, 6, 7, 410651) MUNNALAL, It is not right that you have not written to me at all recently.
('88', 277, 6, 8, 410726) I was to reply to your other questions only after I had received your reply to my suggestion, and that is still so.
('88', 277, 6, 9, 410842) Kanchan is on fire.
('88', 277, 6, 10, 410862) Who else but you can quench that fire?
('88', 277, 6, 11, 410901) Even if you released her, she would not marry anybody else.
('88', 277, 6, 12, 410961) And she is not one to satisfy her passion through illicit relations with somebody.
('88', 277, 6, 13, 411044) And yet passion is burning her up.
('88', 277, 6, 14, 411079) She does not know the value of brahmacharya.
('88', 277, 6, 15, 411124) She has married to gratify her passion.
('88', 277, 6, 16, 411164) You did not tell her about the condition of brahmacharya when marrying her.
('88', 277, 6, 17, 411240) Is it not your dharma, now, to satisfy her?
('88', 277, 6, 18, 411284) If you were completely free from passion, I would have had nothing to tell you.
('88', 277, 6, 19, 411364) After giving Kanchan the gift of children you may observe brahmacharya, or you should calm her not with anger but with pure love.
('88', 277, 6, 20, 411494) You should look after Kishorelal, Gomati, Chhaganlal and Borde, and so also should Kanchan.

('88', 277, 11, 27, 411764) I have your letter.

('88', 278, 1, 3, 412065) However, if he cannot bring himself to agree to this I cannot force him against his will.
('88', 278, 1, 4, 412155) You should, therefore, remain calm.
('88', 278, 1, 5, 412191) Show this to Munnalal.

('88', 278, 1, 7, 412312) For the present I should like you, if your health permits, to look after Gomatibehn, as also the others who are ill.
('88', 278, 1, 8, 412429) We shall discuss the question of your accompanying me when I come.
('88', 278, 1, 9, 412496) You had wanted to accompany me to Madras.

('88', 278, 1, 12, 412613) We shall do so when I arrive there.
('88', 278, 1, 13, 412649) Meanwhile you should remain calm, get well and serve as much as you can.
('88', 278, 1, 14, 412722) You are a fine worker.
('88', 278, 1, 15, 412745) Let service be your husband, your hobby, your all.

('88', 280, 8, 19, 415137) Gomatibehn is actually ill.
('88', 280, 8, 20, 415165) She is suffering from some kind of typhoid.
('88', 280, 8, 21, 415209) The constant fever has now come down a little.
('88', 280, 8, 22, 415256) We trust and hope that it will come down to normal.
('88', 280, 8, 23, 415308) But it will take some time for her to leave the sick bed, and it will be quite a while before she is able to look after herself.
('88', 280, 8, 24, 415437) She would not accept the services of anyone who may offer them, and if they can help it, neither of them would accept anybody’s services.
('88', 280, 8, 25, 415575) I would like it if someone were to stay with them now and look after them.
('88', 280, 8, 26, 415650) There is no question as to whether they will like it, for I have not heard of their having ever complained to anyone about not getting any service.
('88', 280, 8, 27, 415798) But wouldn’t my heart complain?
('88', 280, 8, 28, 415830) If, therefore, you can get away from there and go to Sevagram, and if your health permits you to look after them, I think it would be the best

('88', 281, 1, 2, 416062) arrangement.
('88', 281, 1, 3, 416075) In that case you will also have to cancel your plan of accompanying me to Calcutta.
('88', 281, 1, 4, 416159) I believe it will be February by the time I finish touring and return to the Ashram.
('88', 281, 1, 5, 416244) By that time, winter will be over and we may hope that both of them will have got well.
('88', 281, 1, 6, 416332) I hope to reach Sevagram on the 21st.
('88', 281, 1, 7, 416370) I should like both of you to go to Sevagram before then.
('88', 281, 1, 8, 416427) I think it necessary for Manilal to accompany me on my tour, not to look after me but to gain experience which might help him in his work and to get to know people.
('88', 281, 1, 9, 416592) He, therefore, will not be there all the time.
('88', 281, 1, 10, 416639) Arun will certainly accompany me to Sevagram.
('88', 281, 1, 11, 416685) One cannot say what progress he will make in studies, but I think he is showing himself to be a good servant.
('88', 281, 1, 12, 416795) He has taken to Kanu and, therefore, he is bound to learn to serve.
('88', 281, 1, 13, 416863) Hence he also will help.
('88', 281, 1, 14, 416888) Besides, if both of you agree of your own accord, not for my sake, to let Arun stay and grow up in the Ashram, as he now says he would like to do, he will study and also acquire practical wisdom.
('88', 281, 1, 15, 417084) Moreover, he has now become friends with Aminbhai, who is a learned man, and stays in the Ashram.
('88', 281, 1, 16, 417182) Probably you do not know him.
('88', 281, 1, 17, 417212) Manilal is certain to know him.
('88', 281, 1, 18, 417244) He is an artist like you, but a much better one.
('88', 281, 1, 19, 417293) Arun has already started learning from him.
('88', 281, 1, 20, 417337) And Aminbhai says that if he were given two years’ time Arun would learn much more here than he would by joining even the best of schools.
('88', 281, 1, 21, 417476) This may perhaps be too optimistic a view.
('88', 281, 1, 22, 417519) But what difference does it make to us?
('88', 281, 1, 23, 417559) It is a fact that his company is bene ficial.
('88', 281, 1, 24, 417605) My purpose in writing all this about Arun is to tell you that he has the spirit of service in him and that, since he will be with you in the Ashram, you will not get bored there.
('88', 281, 1, 25, 417784) Kishorelal and Gomati behn will thus have the benefit of your service without any hardship to you.
('88', 281, 1, 26, 417883) If they feel that you are likely to suffer in any way by staying there to look after them, they are not the type who will put up with it.
('88', 281, 1, 27, 418021) Let me add too that Kashi also is tired out.
('88', 281, 1, 28, 418066) She cannot work much now.
('88', 281, 1, 29, 418092) And Chhaganlal is on sickbed.
('88', 281, 1, 30, 418122) He has continuous fever.
('88', 281, 1, 31, 418147) If it turns out to be as prolonged as Gomatibehn’s, he also will require to be looked after.
('88', 281, 1, 32, 418240) I believe, therefore, that it will be good if you are in the Ashram for his sake at any rate.
('88', 281, 1, 33, 418334) I have thus put before you what I believe to be your duty.
('88', 281, 1, 34, 418393) Both of you may think over this and do what you consider right.
('88', 281, 1, 35, 418457) If your presence there is not essential, both of you should at once leave for the Ashram.
('88', 281, 1, 36, 418547) You may write to me from there and tell me what you intend to do.
('88', 281, 1, 37, 418613) Ila 1 will be with you, of course.

('88', 287, 10, 20, 426342) VASUMATI, I have your letter of October 31. I see from it that you have not received my previous letter.
('88', 287, 10, 21, 426447) There is nothing wrong with my health.
('88', 287, 10, 22, 426486) I am quite well.
('88', 287, 10, 23, 426503) I shall leave here for Bombay on the 19th, reaching Sevagram on the 21st.
('88', 287, 10, 24, 426577) I shall leave for Calcutta on December 30 and be there for a month and three weeks.
('88', 287, 10, 25, 426661) Then maybe 15 days in Madras.

('88', 288, 1, 2, 426737) again back to Sevagram for 5 or 7 days and thence perhaps to the Frontier Province.
('88', 288, 1, 3, 426821) Only on returning from there can I settle down in Sevagram.
('88', 288, 1, 4, 426881) This means that right now my stay in Sevagram cannot be permanent.
('88', 288, 1, 5, 426948) If therefore you want to spend a little time in the Ashram you can do so only in my absence.
('88', 288, 1, 6, 427041) But do as you feel inclined.

('88', 288, 5, 11, 427190) November 6, 1945
('88', 288, 6, 12, 427207) BAPA, I have your letter as also the cheque for Lila Jog.
('88', 288, 6, 13, 427265) I shall of course forward your letter to Mridulabehn.
('88', 288, 6, 14, 427319) Still it is certainly right to send the cheque.
('88', 288, 7, 15, 427367) What you say about Sushila Pai is right.
('88', 288, 7, 16, 427408) It was never my intention to make one of the two permanent.
('88', 288, 7, 17, 427468) But as long as Sucheta stays there, whether as a candidate or for examinations, she will be considered a candidate for the post of organizing secretary.
('88', 288, 7, 18, 427621) Won’t she?
('88', 288, 7, 19, 427632) So the same should hold good in the case of Sushila Pai also.
('88', 288, 7, 20, 427694) She also wanted it that way.
('88', 288, 7, 21, 427723) But I saw that Sucheta did not like it.
('88', 288, 7, 22, 427763) So if Sushila Pai goes there it will be just to observe the work and to see if she can adjust herself in the office.
('88', 288, 7, 23, 427880) Sucheta is going to let me know her decision only after seeing you.

('88', 288, 11, 28, 428082) POONA, November 6, 1945
('88', 288, 12, 29, 428106) DINSHAW, I could not write to you yesterday but I kept mulling over things.
('88', 288, 12, 30, 428182) You can have anything you like under the Trust, but I would

('88', 289, 0, 1, 428288) 290 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('88', 289, 1, 2, 428330) say that we cannot start anything at Singhgadh right now.
('88', 289, 1, 3, 428388) It is another matter if I think of something to start there.
('88', 289, 1, 4, 428449) The Bombay centre will have to be closed down.
('88', 289, 1, 5, 428496) I would advise you to keep it for your own diversion and as a source of income.
('88', 289, 1, 6, 428576) I cannot afford to have it under the Trust.
('88', 289, 1, 7, 428620) I have still not received the figures about your personal expenses.
('88', 289, 1, 8, 428688) If you are provided board and lodging and Rs. 500/ per month from here, in my view, you should not think of making extra money from nature cure.
('88', 289, 1, 9, 428833) But here you must ask your own conscience.
('88', 289, 1, 10, 428876) If this is a bitter pill, then you must live in Bombay and carry on your practice.
('88', 289, 1, 11, 428959) If you put it in the Trust, it may be closed down soon after.
('88', 289, 1, 12, 429021) You do not have to worry at all about the expense here.
('88', 289, 1, 13, 429077) I shall manage.
('88', 289, 1, 14, 429093) I am anticipating that there will not be a single rich patient left here by the end of December.
('88', 289, 1, 15, 429190) The facilities here will solely be for those whom I send.
('88', 289, 1, 16, 429248) The person I send to manage things here will stay here.
('88', 289, 1, 17, 429304) Meat will be cooked in the kitchen for only Maji and any members of your family who may be visiting but not for any patient.
('88', 289, 1, 18, 429429) My dharma tells me that non vegetarian food, such as mutton, liver, etc., have no place in nature cure.
('88', 289, 1, 19, 429533) I do not suggest that those things have not benefited or cannot benefit anyone.
('88', 289, 1, 20, 429613) All I say is that in my view they cannot be included in nature cure.
('88', 289, 1, 21, 429682) The entire portion I am occupying at present will be reserved for you and Gulbai and it should not be necessary at any time to vacate it even for me.
('88', 289, 1, 22, 429832) Whenever I come, I can live anywhere on the upper floor.
('88', 289, 1, 23, 429889) It will not be difficult for me even to stay in the room which Saralabehn is at present occupying.
('88', 289, 1, 24, 429988) If it rains I can settle in the bathroom.
('88', 289, 1, 25, 430030) But it is not the least bit fair for me to occupy the portion especially built for Gulbai.
('88', 289, 1, 26, 430121) A ‘stock list’ should be prepared for the Trust.
('88', 289, 1, 27, 430170) Perhaps it cannot be done till Bhimnag comes, though of course I have with me so many people here that I can easily get the stock list and such other things prepared.
('88', 289, 1, 28, 430337) But your method of getting work done is altogether different.
('88', 289, 1, 29, 430399) I do not like it.
('88', 289, 1, 30, 430417) That way there are many things that I do not like, but I put up with them.
('88', 289, 1, 31, 430492) If you take up the responsibility, most of the things here can be settled while I am here.
('88', 289, 1, 32, 430583) I consider it wrong that you do not get patients to work.
('88', 289, 1, 33, 430641) Vanamala is capable of doing a lot of work.
('88', 289, 1, 34, 430685) All the patients would not be bed ridden.
('88', 289, 1, 35, 430727) From now on, only the poor must be admitted.
('88', 289, 1, 36, 430772) If there is any rich patient, he will be brought only by me and he will serve some purpose.
('88', 289, 1, 37, 430864) I may even take money from him and he will stay at my pleasure.
('88', 289, 1, 38, 430928) It irks me that you have not trained even Gulbai properly.
('88', 289, 1, 39, 430987) No one here seems to be

('88', 290, 1, 2, 431057) getting any training.
('88', 290, 1, 3, 431079) I do not even see the three year training being given here which you thought was necessary.
('88', 290, 1, 4, 431171) That is not correct.
('88', 290, 1, 5, 431192) But in this matter, I have got to be content with whatever you can easily provide.
('88', 290, 1, 6, 431275) If you think that thereby the whole thing would completely change and if it is not proper for me to interfere to such an extent, you can remove me.
('88', 290, 1, 7, 431423) If I were to involve myself in the matter, I would let things continue as they are.
('88', 290, 1, 8, 431507) I receive letters from people from all over.
('88', 290, 1, 9, 431552) They are willing to help in this or even join in.
('88', 290, 1, 10, 431602) Some of them I must admit are very good.
('88', 290, 1, 11, 431643) But till such time as I see you as a votary of nature cure and know who will be the right people to work with you, I would not like to admit any nature cure expert.
('88', 290, 1, 12, 431808) If I run this workshop I would like to pass on its benefits to the thousands of people outside.
('88', 290, 1, 13, 431904) For that, I would naturally need to have a large number of workers.
('88', 290, 1, 14, 431972) Only when that happens, can we at last have something like a university.
('88', 290, 1, 15, 432045) Give some thought to this.
('88', 290, 1, 16, 432072) I have not kept a copy of this letter.
('88', 290, 1, 17, 432111) Return it to me after reading.

('88', 294, 12, 22, 437519) The other two were tried and sentenced to death along with their helpers.

('88', 295, 3, 6, 437954) I am glad that you wish to be forgiven for writing the letter.
('88', 295, 3, 7, 438017) That shows also that you should have procured a postcard beforehand.

('88', 295, 8, 16, 438403) MRIDULA, I am enclosing a cheque for Rs. 375—Lila Jog’s three months’ salary.
('88', 295, 8, 17, 438481) I am also enclosing the letter Bapa has sent along with the cheque.
('88', 295, 8, 18, 438549) This is just for your information.
('88', 295, 8, 19, 438584) Deliver the cheque to Lila Jog and send me a receipt.
('88', 295, 8, 20, 438638) Your work is then over.
('88', 295, 8, 21, 438662) The purpose of sending you a copy of Bapa’s letter is that you may know that Bapa is firm in his views.
('88', 295, 8, 22, 438766) My reading is that there is some mutual misunderstanding.
('88', 295, 8, 23, 438824) It is not that anyone is deliberately lying.
('88', 295, 8, 24, 438869) What it means is that there is some purpose in what in English is called “red tape”; that is, to get everything in writing so that there can be no scope for saying something different.
('88', 295, 8, 25, 439054) Red tape has and does not have a place among family members.
('88', 295, 8, 26, 439115) It means that none of them are bound to one another and that everything is going on smoothly

('88', 296, 6, 20, 440143) Let things take their own course.
('88', 296, 6, 21, 440177) If Kailas is really so timid, then I feel she should stay with her parents.
('88', 296, 6, 22, 440253) Let her learn what she can while serving them.
('88', 296, 6, 23, 440300) This is just my opinion.
('88', 296, 6, 24, 440325) Of course I shall be happy if she studies at the Talimi Sangh and becomes proficient.
('88', 296, 6, 25, 440411) I would not like her to serve at the cost of her education.
('88', 296, 6, 26, 440471) I on my part believe that pure service is in itself education.

('88', 297, 3, 5, 441100) Even after having been so close to me, don’t you know that asking for messages really brings harm?
('88', 297, 3, 6, 441199) I know it is difficult to understand this, but it should not be difficult for a person like you.
('88', 297, 3, 7, 441296) Do men and institutions advance because of praise by others or because of their own qualities and strength and by adding to these day by day?
('88', 297, 3, 8, 441438) Will you not admit that those who depend on others’ praise progressively become enfeebled?
('88', 297, 3, 9, 441529) The sacrifice made by the Herald is genuine, but does sacrifice need anybody’s praise?
('88', 297, 3, 10, 441616) And what sacrifice can be made by one who expects praise?
('88', 297, 3, 11, 441674) I hope you will be able to follow my rashtrabhasha.

('88', 297, 8, 19, 441940) There are occasions when one has to write about those with whom one is very close.
('88', 297, 8, 20, 442023) The rule to follow is that people closely associated should not eulogize each other.
('88', 297, 8, 21, 442108) I can write much in support of this but what shall I write to a person like you?
('88', 297, 8, 22, 442189) Better to spare me from all such things.
('88', 297, 8, 23, 442230) I am sorry I have not even seen the daily called Samsar.
('88', 297, 8, 24, 442287) Even if it comes here, it is not shown to me because so many editors are kind enough to send me their dailies.
('88', 297, 8, 25, 442398) I can say that these days I do not read newspapers at all.
('88', 297, 8, 26, 442457) Clippings from newspapers believed to be useful to me are placed before me.
('88', 297, 8, 27, 442533) If I send a message to one, why not to the others?

('88', 298, 3, 6, 442896) I write the truth as I personally see it.

('88', 298, 3, 8, 442967) It is beyond reach.
('88', 298, 3, 9, 442987) At the most we can say it is neti, neti 1. The truth that we see is relative, many sided, plural and is the whole truth for a given time.
('88', 298, 3, 10, 443125) There is no scope for vanity in it and the only way of reaching it is through ahimsa.
('88', 298, 3, 11, 443211) Pure and absolute truth should be our ideal.
('88', 298, 3, 12, 443256) We can reach the ideal only by constantly meditating on it, and reaching it is attaining moksha.

('88', 299, 10, 20, 445000) Your handwriting is particularly bad.
('88', 299, 10, 21, 445038) It is not worthy of you.
('88', 299, 10, 22, 445063) In my view each character of the alphabet is a drawing, and no drawing is made by scrawling.
('88', 299, 10, 23, 445156) Whether it is of a mere learner or that of a great painter the broad outline must look the same to the eye.
('88', 299, 10, 24, 445264) The drawings of a parrot made by a learner and an expert artist will look alike in their general form, but the quality of art in each will reveal who is the learner and who the expert.

('88', 300, 1, 3, 445603) The difference would be seen only in the quality of art in each.
('88', 300, 1, 4, 445668) But in the drawings of your letters there is no resemblance at all.
('88', 300, 1, 5, 445736) I would blame your teacher more than you for this.

('88', 300, 6, 14, 446159) But one thing is clear, namely, that you should tell Kanchan in plain words that you do not look upon her as your wife and that she also should not look upon you as her husband.
('88', 300, 6, 15, 446337) You should accept no service from her.
('88', 300, 6, 16, 446376) Indeed, you two should not live in the same place.
('88', 300, 6, 17, 446427) I am prepared to arrange for your stay in different places.
('88', 300, 6, 18, 446487) This would be a painful duty.
('88', 300, 6, 19, 446517) But your letter makes it incumbent upon me to take such a step.

('88', 301, 3, 5, 446985) I cannot say I have read the whole of it, but Chi.
('88', 301, 3, 6, 447036) Kanu has told me in substance all that I should know.
('88', 301, 3, 7, 447090) If indeed you have settled down as you say you have, I am happy and Ba’s soul will rejoice wherever it is.

('88', 301, 3, 9, 447292) They have become closer to you than your relations by blood.

('88', 301, 3, 14, 447655) If Manilal feels any hesitation in sending you your keys, please believe me to be the cause behind his hesitation.
('88', 301, 3, 15, 447770) I do not possess a pie which I can call my own, and I do not feel that I have the right to spend any money on your account.

('88', 302, 1, 3, 448733) If Uncle recovers fully, all the credit will go to you, though personally I would give part of it to Bhai Krishnavarma.
('88', 302, 1, 4, 448853) He has, so far, not asked me even for the expense he has incurred on Uncle and has nursed him as well as he could for the sake of Ba.
('88', 302, 1, 5, 448987) Had he not come forward to help, I would have been at a loss to know where to put Uncle.
('88', 302, 1, 6, 449076) Your idea of helping Uncle run a small store in your neigh bourhood is no doubt good, but please do not put it into effect immediately.
('88', 302, 1, 7, 449212) After his establishment has been wound up, as you have suggested, and he has completely forgotten about it and become perfectly composed, I see no harm in your letting him start a store in partnership with any member of your family.

('88', 302, 6, 14, 449667) Arun has taken away your letter and has not returned it.
('88', 302, 6, 15, 449724) He is always in high spirits these days.
('88', 302, 6, 16, 449765) He soon makes friends with everybody who comes here.
('88', 302, 6, 17, 449818) So I do not now worry about him.
('88', 302, 6, 18, 449851) Though he makes no effort, he does learn a little.
('88', 302, 6, 19, 449902) There is, therefore, no need for any of you to worry about him just now.
('88', 302, 6, 20, 449975) Please go to Bombay for the books.
('88', 302, 6, 21, 450010) Maybe you have already gone there.
('88', 302, 6, 22, 450045) If you wish, you may certainly pay a flying visit here before returning.
('88', 302, 6, 23, 450118) But do not come here for my sake at all, for all my needs are being properly looked after.
('88', 302, 6, 24, 450209) So far as I can judge, you need not come even for the sake of Arun.
('88', 302, 6, 25, 450277) If, therefore, you come it must be only for the pleasure of the trip.
('88', 302, 6, 26, 450347) We will leave for Bombay on the morning of the 19th.
('88', 302, 6, 27, 450400) I should advise you to wait for me in Bombay or, as I have already written, at Sevagram.

('88', 303, 1, 8, 451055) He has asked for them.
('88', 303, 1, 9, 451078) He has written a long letter.
('88', 303, 1, 10, 451108) He wishes to sell off his things.
('88', 303, 1, 11, 451142) He seems to be well composed in mind at present.

('88', 303, 6, 21, 451588) But one must not hope for any reward for acting upon one’s resolutions.

('88', 305, 1, 2, 453700) Tell Bapu that I have always held the view, which has become all the clearer to me while translating some books, that if we wish to make Hindustani the language of the common people, its vocabulary should mostly consist, except for words which have religious associations, of Arabic and Persian words or their derivatives instead of Sanskrit.
('88', 305, 1, 3, 454043) The seven or eight hundred years of Hindu Muslim contact has made Urdu a more common language than Hindi.

('88', 309, 3, 7, 459252) On the one hand Bapa writes to say that I was hasty in getting it published because I had agreed that we should publish it only after the meeting of the Managing Committee.
('88', 309, 3, 8, 459425) How nice it would have been if he had had me put it down in writing.
('88', 309, 3, 9, 459494) I myself have no such recollection.
('88', 309, 3, 10, 459530) Kanu says that he was present at the time and that I had told Bapa that if something had happened and if the matter was to be published, the sooner this was done the better.
('88', 309, 3, 11, 459704) Well, that is as it may be.
('88', 309, 3, 12, 459732) Your own recollection is that I was to give a short statement of my own in the end.
('88', 309, 3, 13, 459816) I remember having said something like that but I had not decided on it.
('88', 309, 3, 14, 459888) Having considered the whole thing I felt that since my letter 22 to you gave the entire background it was better published.
('88', 309, 3, 15, 460012) Now if this step was mistaken how can it be rectified?
('88', 309, 3, 16, 460067) I don’t see anything wrong in publishing the facts.
('88', 309, 3, 17, 460119) I have not seen what has come out in the newspapers.
('88', 309, 3, 18, 460172) If you are talking about the English translation, I had certainly approved it but I do not know if the same has appeared in the newspapers.
('88', 309, 3, 19, 460312) Anyway, for the present I am treating this chapter as closed.
('88', 309, 3, 20, 460374) It is good you are coming on the 12th.
('88', 309, 3, 21, 460413) This of course will be posted.

('88', 309, 8, 27, 460581) BAPA, I have your letter of November 6. By all means have a separate kitchen.
('88', 309, 8, 28, 460659) We should not put too much burden on Shamlal, that is to say on his wife.
('88', 309, 8, 29, 460733) Nothing has been decided about Sushila Pai.
('88', 309, 8, 30, 460777) She wishes to come as a joint organizer.

('88', 310, 1, 3, 461016) Sushila Pai is a very good worker.
('88', 310, 1, 4, 461051) She is a learned woman.
('88', 310, 1, 5, 461075) She was for many years the Head Mistress of Vanita Vishram, Rajkot.
('88', 310, 1, 6, 461143) She gave up the job on her own.
('88', 310, 1, 7, 461175) She is a woman of great promise.
('88', 310, 1, 8, 461208) It is possible that she will not like to join as a clerk.
('88', 310, 1, 9, 461266) In whatever capacity she comes, it will be only provisionally.
('88', 310, 1, 10, 461329) I have not written to her again as I am waiting for Sucheta’s letter.
('88', 310, 1, 11, 461399) Please see how the work is to be divided.
('88', 310, 1, 12, 461441) Spend on the building only as much as is necessary for providing the conveniences.
('88', 310, 1, 13, 461524) I take it that you will not have to get permission for this from the Managing Committee.
('88', 310, 1, 14, 461613) I am not going through the rules and regulations.
('88', 310, 1, 15, 461663) I have passed on that responsibility to Shamlal.
('88', 310, 1, 16, 461712) In fact we should know it by heart.
('88', 310, 1, 17, 461748) There was a time when I could do that but of late I have forgotten all about it.
('88', 310, 1, 18, 461829) I have had to.
('88', 310, 1, 19, 461844) I got your letter of today after writing this.

('88', 310, 6, 25, 462027) SUMI, I like your letter.
('88', 310, 6, 26, 462053) You have improved your handwriting a lot.
('88', 310, 6, 27, 462095) But your vowel strokes are not always that same.
('88', 310, 6, 28, 462144) That is a defect.
('88', 310, 6, 29, 462162) You make your strokes look like pearl pendants.
('88', 310, 6, 30, 462210) Nowadays girls have made this a fashion, but it is a mistake.
('88', 310, 6, 31, 462272) Strokes should always be slanting.
('88', 310, 6, 32, 462307) At the most you can put a dot on top.
('88', 310, 6, 33, 462345) I am not at all happy that Rs. 125 was stolen from your pocket and I am very angry with Nimu.
('88', 310, 6, 34, 462439) She could have sent the money by money order.
('88', 310, 6, 35, 462485) You can always have such dealings with Devdas and you should.
('88', 310, 7, 36, 462547) Just because I have appreciated your handwriting, don’t think that there is no room for improvement.
('88', 310, 7, 37, 462648) You should yourself see and try to improve it.
('88', 310, 7, 38, 462695) Take care of your health, physical and mental.
('88', 310, 7, 39, 462742) Let me know what you have gained from Nagpur.

('88', 311, 3, 8, 463273) I am glad you have settled down at the Bank of Jaipur.
('88', 311, 3, 9, 463328) Become an expert at your job and stick to the bank so that in the field of your work you can earn a name for yourself.
('88', 311, 3, 10, 463447) I know of two persons who, just like you, began even lower than clerks and yet reached the top and became famous.
('88', 311, 3, 11, 463561) Both of them are no more.
('88', 311, 3, 12, 463587) They were Gujaratis but it is immaterial whether they were Gujaratis or not.
('88', 311, 3, 13, 463664) One is bound to make progress if one sincerely sticks to something and wishes to acquire mastery in it.

('88', 313, 8, 17, 465933) The report says that Pandit Jawaharlal had sent a nice message but that it was suppressed and was not read out.
('88', 313, 8, 18, 466045) Bhai Munshi says that he never received any such message, let alone suppress it.
('88', 313, 8, 19, 466126) If this is true and someone gave a false report, he should have signed it.

('88', 313, 8, 21, 466224) You could have had a talk with him.

('88', 316, 3, 6, 469532) Now that I think of it I seem to remember we did have a talk about the matter.
('88', 316, 3, 7, 469611) There does not seem to be even a hint of it in our letters.
('88', 316, 3, 8, 469671) Kanu says he was present at our talk and that as far as he can remember you had made the suggestion but I had not accepted it because postponing publication of the resignation 1 would have served no purpose.
('88', 316, 3, 9, 469879) If however the President has no right at all to accept a resignation, then the thing assumes an entirely different aspect.
('88', 316, 3, 10, 470002) But the case only supports what I have been saying all along, namely, that word of mouth should be considered as having no weight.
('88', 316, 3, 11, 470133) Only what is written down is true, more so for a person like me whose memory is dim.
('88', 316, 3, 12, 470218) So if things are put down in writing it will be a safeguard for both.
('88', 316, 3, 13, 470288) You close your letter with “khair” 2. Do not go by it.
('88', 316, 3, 14, 470343) Take to heart the lesson you learn from this episode.
('88', 316, 3, 15, 470397) I consider the episode in itself trivial but it carries significance.
('88', 316, 3, 16, 470467) It was I who sent a copy of the resignation to the Press.

('88', 316, 7, 23, 470736) We shall discuss this further when we meet.
('88', 316, 7, 24, 470780) If I said anything about the money for his ashram I do not recollect it.
('88', 316, 7, 25, 470853) This again shows that mere word of mouth has no value.

('88', 323, 12, 17, 479744) This is a thoroughly revised edition of the Constructive Programme which I first wrote in 1941. 1 The items included in it have not been arranged in any order, certainly not in the order of their importance.
('88', 323, 12, 18, 479952) When the reader discovers that a particular subject though important in itself in terms of independence does not find place in the programme, he should know that the omission is not intentional.
('88', 323, 12, 19, 480147) He should unhesitatingly add to my list and let me know.
('88', 323, 12, 20, 480204) My list does not pretend to be exhaustive; it is merely illustrative.
('88', 323, 12, 21, 480274) The reader will see several new and important additions.
('88', 323, 13, 22, 480331) 1 Vide “Constructive Programe” Its Meaning and Place”,13 12 1941
('88', 324, 0, 1, 480396) VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 6 DECEMBER, 1945 325
('88', 324, 1, 2, 480442) Readers, whether workers and volunteers or not, should definitely realize that the constructive programme is the truthful and non volent way of winning poorna swaraj.
('88', 324, 1, 3, 480609) Its wholesale fulfilment is complete independence.
('88', 324, 1, 4, 480660) Imagine all the forty crores of people busying themselves with the whole of the constructive programme which is designed to build up the nation from the very bottom upward.
('88', 324, 1, 5, 480833) Can anybody dispute the proposition that it must mean complete independence in every sense of the expression, including the ousting of foreign domination?
('88', 324, 1, 6, 480988) When the critics laugh at the proposition, what they mean is that forty crores of people will never co operate in the effort to fulfil the programme.
('88', 324, 1, 7, 481138) No doubt, there is considerable truth in the scoff.
('88', 324, 1, 8, 481190) My answer is, it is still worth the attempt.
('88', 324, 1, 9, 481235) Given an indomitable will on the part of a band of earnest workers, the programme is as workable as any other and more so than most.
('88', 324, 1, 10, 481368) Anyway, I have no substitute for it, if it is to be based on non violence.
('88', 324, 1, 11, 481443) Civil disobedience, mass or individual, is an aid to constructive effort and is a full substitute for armed revolt.
('88', 324, 1, 12, 481559) Training is necessary as well for civil disobedience as for armed revolt.
('88', 324, 1, 13, 481633) Only the ways are different.
('88', 324, 1, 14, 481662) Action in either case takes place only when occasion demands.
('88', 324, 1, 15, 481724) Training for military revolt means learning the use of arms ending perhaps in the atomic bomb.
('88', 324, 1, 16, 481819) For civil disobedience it means the constructive programme.
('88', 324, 1, 17, 481879) Therefore, workers will never be on the look out for civil resistance.
('88', 324, 1, 18, 481950) They will hold themselves in readiness, if the constructive effort is sought to be defeated.
('88', 324, 1, 19, 482043) From one or two illustrations it will be seen where it can be and where it cannot be offered.
('88', 324, 1, 20, 482137) Political pacts we know have been and can be, but personal friendship with individuals cannot be, prevented.
('88', 324, 1, 21, 482246) Such friendships, selfless and genuine, must be the basis for political pacts.
('88', 324, 1, 22, 482325) Similarly, centralized khadi can be defeated by the Government, but no power can defeat individual manufacture and use of khadi.
('88', 324, 1, 23, 482454) The manufacture and use of khadi must not be imposed upon the people, but it must be intelligently and willingly accepted by them as one of the items of the freedom movement.
('88', 324, 1, 24, 482629) This can be done only from the villages as units.
('88', 324, 1, 25, 482679) Pioneers even in such programmes can be obstructed.
('88', 324, 1, 26, 482731) They have had to go through the fire of suffering throughout the world.
('88', 324, 1, 27, 482803) There is no swaraj without suffering.
('88', 324, 1, 28, 482841) In violence, truth is the first and greatest sufferer; in non violence it is ever triumphant.
('88', 324, 1, 29, 482935) Moreover, men composing the Government are not to be regarded as enemies.
('88', 324, 1, 30, 483009) To regard them as such will be contrary to the non violent spirit.
('88', 324, 1, 31, 483076) Part we must, but as friends.
('88', 324, 1, 32, 483106) If this preliminary observation has gone home to the reader, he will find the constructive programme to be full of deep interest.

('88', 325, 3, 5, 483495) NATURE CURE CLINIC, 6 TODIWALA ROAD, POONA, November 13, 1945
('88', 325, 4, 6, 483557) DEAR SIR EVAN, I have just seen Reuter’s message from London about the threatened arrest of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
('88', 325, 5, 7, 483674) I admit that Pandit Nehru’s speeches are hot, if the British rulers do not want to part with power and hand over to the people what is theirs.
('88', 325, 5, 8, 483817) They are not, if the British professions are real.
('88', 325, 5, 9, 483868) It will be wrong to attribute hatred or malice to him.
('88', 325, 5, 10, 483923) He undoubtedly speaks strongly against the I. C. S. men.
('88', 325, 5, 11, 483980) But there he speaks the people’s mind.
('88', 325, 5, 12, 484019) And he is right.
('88', 325, 5, 13, 484036) The fine doctrine propounded by His Excellency of “Forget and Forgive” can only apply to the excesses of a soldiery in action but surely not to inexusable butchery, inhumanity, bribery, corruption and the like.
('88', 325, 5, 14, 484247) If his statements are wrong, they should be tested through an open and impartial tribunal.
('88', 325, 5, 15, 484338) If the Government’s hands are clean they have nothing to fear from publicity.
('88', 325, 5, 16, 484416) I will not waste His Excellency’s time by arguing about the obvious.
('88', 325, 6, 17, 484485) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI

('88', 326, 10, 15, 486013) JIVANJI, I have your letter.
('88', 326, 10, 16, 486042) I have been working since the last eight days on the booklet regarding constructive work.
('88', 326, 10, 17, 486132) That is to say, I have been giving it every minute that I can spare from time to time.
('88', 326, 10, 18, 486219) I finished it two days ago, but I made so many revisions that I intend to get some portions rewritten.
('88', 326, 10, 19, 486322) So that has taken another two days and is likely to take two more days still.
('88', 326, 10, 20, 486400) To that extent the pamphlet will become new and perfect.
('88', 326, 10, 21, 486457) I could have polished it still further.
('88', 326, 10, 22, 486497) But is not greed a hill that lives and grows?
('88', 326, 10, 23, 486543) It is not inert.
('88', 326, 10, 24, 486560) Do not believe all that has appeared in the newspapers regarding Sardar’s biography.
('88', 326, 10, 25, 486645) I have not seen the report.
('88', 326, 10, 26, 486673) When I heard about the plan for presenting a book of tributes to Sardar, as promised, I put an end to it and suggested that an authentic biography be written instead.
('88', 326, 10, 27, 486840) There would be no question of presenting it to him.
('88', 326, 10, 28, 486892) I therefore refused to give a message when they approached me and thus stopped the plan for tributes.
('88', 326, 10, 29, 486994) It was Munshi 2

('88', 327, 1, 3, 487235) I have not inquired what happened or is happening after that.
('88', 327, 1, 4, 487297) I do not know whether you are writing the biography or getting it written.
('88', 327, 1, 5, 487372) You may ask Munshiji direct.
('88', 327, 1, 6, 487401) The work is entrusted to Patil and Tendulkar.
('88', 327, 1, 7, 487447) The letter is to work as Munshi’s assistant.
('88', 327, 1, 8, 487492) If, therefore, Munshi has agreed, you should put together all the material you get and send it to Munshiji.
('88', 327, 1, 9, 487600) If he is not going to do the work, ask me again.
('88', 327, 1, 10, 487649) I had also suggested that the date for publication of the book should be announced right now and we should adhere to it.
('88', 327, 1, 11, 487770) You may take it that as regards the journals 1 I am ready.
('88', 327, 1, 12, 487829) I do not now, though, how far I shall be able to cope with the work.
('88', 327, 1, 13, 487898) But I think I must do it if the publication can be resumed without difficulty.
('88', 327, 1, 14, 487977) You need not flatter anybody.
('88', 327, 1, 15, 488007) Mavalankar or you may meet the Magistrate officially and ask him.
('88', 327, 1, 16, 488073) If he agrees, take out a licence.
('88', 327, 1, 17, 488107) We should give no binding, orally or in writing.
('88', 327, 1, 18, 488156) Only if the Government also wants the publication of the journals to be resumed may we bring them out.
('88', 327, 1, 19, 488259) It would be intolerable if they were to demand a security as soon as an article appeared.
('88', 327, 1, 20, 488349) If they are interested in the publications being resumed, they will have to give us the required paper.
('88', 327, 1, 21, 488453) After all, how much would we need?
('88', 327, 1, 22, 488488) There is no question of advertisements.
('88', 327, 1, 23, 488528) We shall have to print a large number of copies.
('88', 327, 1, 24, 488577) We must print at many as there is a demand for.
('88', 327, 1, 25, 488625) I expect that we shall have to print at least as many as we used to do.
('88', 327, 1, 26, 488697) Give me full detials.
('88', 327, 1, 27, 488719) And give me reasonable time for the first issue.
('88', 327, 1, 28, 488768) You may, thus, assume that I shall be ready even if I am touring at the time.

('88', 328, 8, 16, 489693) We would not have discussed more yesterday and it is my view that we shall not be able to finish our work at a single sitting.
('88', 328, 8, 17, 489820) We must meet from time to time.
('88', 328, 8, 18, 489852) I am so made that if I had the strength to travel about, I would seek you out, stay with you for a day or two, have some talk and then leave.
('88', 328, 8, 19, 489994) Though I am not in a position to do that now, you may know I have done such things before.
('88', 328, 8, 20, 490085) I want that people should know us as we know each other.
('88', 328, 8, 21, 490142) If in the end we find that our paths are diferent, then so be it.
('88', 328, 8, 22, 490208) Our hearts will still remain one, for they are one.
('88', 328, 8, 23, 490260) The talks we had yesterday have given me the impression that there is not much difference in our outlook or the way we understand things.

('88', 329, 1, 2, 490473) tell you how I have understood you.
('88', 329, 1, 3, 490509) If there is any difference you will let me know.
('88', 329, 1, 4, 490558) (1) The crucial question according to you, is how to ensure man’s mental, economic, political and moral development.
('88', 329, 1, 5, 490675) That is my position too.
('88', 329, 1, 6, 490700) (2) And in doing so every inividual should have equal right and opportunity.
('88', 329, 1, 7, 490777) (3) From this point of view there should be equality between villages and cities.
('88', 329, 1, 8, 490859) And therefore their food and drink, their way of life, their dress and their habits should be the same.
('88', 329, 1, 9, 490963) If such a condition is to be brought about people should produce their own cloth and food and build their on houses.
('88', 329, 1, 10, 491080) So also they should produce their own water and electricity.
('88', 329, 1, 11, 491141) (4) Man is not born to live in the jungle; he is born to live in society.
('88', 329, 1, 12, 491215) If we are to make sure that one person does not ride on an other’s back, the unit should be an ideal village or a social group which will be self sufficient, but the members of which will be interdependent.
('88', 329, 1, 13, 491422) This conception will bring about a change in human relationship all over the world.

('88', 330, 1, 5, 492530) That is why I do not like your new village scheme.
('88', 330, 1, 6, 492581) My advice is that if you have the time, go and see our villages and do what you can.
('88', 330, 1, 7, 492666) Go and see what my associates, the Kumarappa brothers and the other three are doing.
('88', 330, 1, 8, 492751) I have always liked to keep good relations with America but I have never liked having an agency there, nor do I like it now.
('88', 330, 1, 9, 492876) This is more or less a matter of self satisfaction if not self deception.
('88', 330, 1, 10, 492950) If we build up strength in India itself, it is bound to have its impact.
('88', 330, 1, 11, 493023) The British Government spends lakhs of rupees on spreading falsehood.
('88', 330, 1, 12, 493093) Must we imitate their ways to spread truth?
('88', 330, 1, 13, 493137) I know the clergy in America do such things.
('88', 330, 1, 14, 493182) I also know that there is, as there should be, a lot of difference between propagating truth and propagating untruth.

('88', 331, 2, 3, 494076) November 14, 1945
('88', 331, 3, 4, 494094) BHAI KRISHNAVARMA, Naturopathy or any other work is never stalled for lack of funds.
('88', 331, 3, 5, 494179) But it certainly is stalled if it lacks purity and sincere workers.
('88', 331, 3, 6, 494247) The figures you have quoted must remain on paper only.
('88', 331, 3, 7, 494302) If the thing had been all that easy in practice, we would have progressed a great deal by now.
('88', 331, 3, 8, 494397) We have to sweat to increase 4 to 20; increasing 20 to 100 or 100 to 500 is just a dream.
('88', 331, 3, 9, 494487) But it does not matter.
('88', 331, 3, 10, 494511) Man can only make an effort.
('88', 331, 3, 11, 494540) There is no need for you to come here.
('88', 331, 3, 12, 494579) I am fully booked.
('88', 331, 3, 13, 494598) I shall be in Bombay on the 20th.
('88', 331, 3, 14, 494632) You can drop in there.
('88', 331, 3, 15, 494655) I shall leave for Wardha the same day.

('88', 332, 1, 2, 495276) 631. LETTER TO DINSHAW K. MEHTA
('88', 332, 2, 3, 495308) POONA, November 14, 1945
('88', 332, 3, 4, 495333) DINSHAW,
('88', 332, 4, 5, 495342) My cogitations go on.
('88', 332, 4, 6, 495364) The institution should close down on December 31. From January 1, it should become an institution for the poor and cease to be one for the rich.
('88', 332, 4, 7, 495509) You have so far insisted that the poor should be taken only after the rich have been accommodated but those who are really poor can hardly reach you and if anyone reaches you, they will have to pay the rates the rich pay, which will completely ruin them.
('88', 332, 4, 8, 495764) From the 1st January let the rich come after the poor are accommodated but only if they can live as the poor.
('88', 332, 4, 9, 495874) The institution should have more cleanliness than it has today.
('88', 332, 4, 10, 495938) Money is not necessary for maintaining cleanliness, but it requires care, love, truth and knowledge.
('88', 332, 4, 11, 496039) So it is better that cleaning work is started from today, but I am afraid it is not possible because no one listens to the others and everyone is his own master.
('88', 332, 4, 12, 496201) If anyone takes interest in work, it is only to please you.
('88', 332, 4, 13, 496261) Therefore there can be improvement only if someone from among the people I mentioned above starts working from today.
('88', 332, 4, 14, 496379) If this thing does not appeal to you, both of us will have to repent ultimately because I believe that cleanliness is a part of God.
('88', 332, 4, 15, 496512) I would amend the saying “cleanliness is next to godliness” and say “cleanliness is godliness”.
('88', 332, 4, 16, 496608) But only if cleanliness is both internal and external can we call it an attribute of God.
('88', 332, 4, 17, 496698) A sign board should be hung here from January 1. It should be written in Marathi, Devanagari, Urdu and English.
('88', 332, 4, 18, 496810) I have not in my mind formed a precise idea but it would be somewhat as follows.
('88', 332, 4, 19, 496891) “The poor are given nature cure treatment here”.The name Healthotorium should be removed.
('88', 332, 4, 20, 496981) There is no need for any name.
('88', 332, 4, 21, 497012) It does not befit a poor institution.
('88', 332, 4, 22, 497050) In fact it does not befit any.
('88', 332, 4, 23, 497081) The English would consider it “vulgar”.
('88', 332, 4, 24, 497121) We should not use foreign things whether they are patent or not.
('88', 332, 4, 25, 497186) The poor cannot afford a bottle of Isapgol pakced in England, Robinson Barley, Quaker Oats, Sanatogen, Horlicks, malted milk or Merck’s Glucose.
('88', 332, 4, 26, 497331) We, from here, cannot teach the people to take these things—it is immaterial who is here—whether Sardar, some Raja or I.
('88', 333, 0, 1, 497452) 334 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('88', 333, 1, 2, 497494) We must make Sanatogen here.
('88', 333, 1, 3, 497523) Things similar to Horlicks and malted milk should be made here and also something like glucose should be available.
('88', 333, 1, 4, 497639) The kitchen can no longer function on the lines it has been doing so far.
('88', 333, 1, 5, 497713) Today you have the means to feed even a king.
('88', 333, 1, 6, 497759) But those means must be given up tomorrow.
('88', 333, 1, 7, 497802) The liberality with which fruit and other things are used here hurts me much.
('88', 333, 1, 8, 497880) It ought to be changed.
('88', 333, 1, 9, 497904) Can’t we manage with jaggery and lemon?
('88', 333, 1, 10, 497944) You must develop the habit of writing.
('88', 333, 1, 11, 497983) Let your Gujarati be faulty, it can be expressed in good language.
('88', 333, 1, 12, 498050) Little booklets should be brought out from here.
('88', 333, 1, 13, 498099) You will have to pay a lot of attention to all these things.
('88', 333, 1, 14, 498160) I do not know how you will be able to do that while earning 4 5 thousand rupees a month.
('88', 333, 1, 15, 498249) But bear in mind that if you cannot do it the University will remain merely a dream.
('88', 333, 1, 16, 498334) I have a capacity for boundless work and also for planning.
('88', 333, 1, 17, 498394) But I do not have a magic wand by waving which I can create a university.
('88', 333, 1, 18, 498468) Further, I do not have the knowledge reuqired for that.
('88', 333, 1, 19, 498524) Therefore I am helpless.
('88', 333, 1, 20, 498549) If I was not helpless I would have started a nature cure clinic of my own, and would have carried on all my activities from there.
('88', 333, 1, 21, 498680) But God did not grant me that.
('88', 333, 1, 22, 498711) Although I was, and still am, very enthusiastic, which is why I am clinging on to you, you are a big man and you have allowed your knowledge to stagnate.
('88', 333, 1, 23, 498865) That is a big stumbling block in your way.
('88', 333, 1, 24, 498908) Your dream will be realized only if you can get over it.
('88', 333, 1, 25, 498965) If your heart bids you that it is not possible, then leave me even now.
('88', 333, 1, 26, 499037) I shall not feel bad.
('88', 333, 1, 27, 499059) Sardar is worried how I am going to cope with the work.
('88', 333, 1, 28, 499115) His worry is meaningless because no one compels me.
('88', 333, 1, 29, 499167) God impels me to do the work.
('88', 333, 1, 30, 499197) If He wants to stop the work He will do so.
('88', 333, 1, 31, 499241) But you seem to have faith in me, so I must warn you about my helplessness.
('88', 333, 1, 32, 499317) And I must let you know the limitations and faults I find in you.
('88', 333, 1, 33, 499383) More when something strikes me.

('88', 334, 2, 3, 499577) November 14, 1945
('88', 334, 3, 4, 499595) BHAI BAKSHI TEKCHAND, Pandit Jawaharlal was here for a day.
('88', 334, 3, 5, 499655) He told me that you were prepared to make a Trust Deed about Jallianwala Bagh and also look after it.
('88', 334, 3, 6, 499757) Before 1942 Bhulabhai was assigned the task of the Trust Deed but some obstacles kept delaying it.
('88', 334, 3, 7, 499856) Then war broke out and the work of the Trust Deed was left in the air.
('88', 334, 3, 8, 499927) I shall be glad if you discuss this with Bhulabhai and complete the work of the Trust Deed.
('88', 334, 4, 9, 500019) Mukerji, who has been the secretary of the Jallianwala Bagh committee for years, will see you.
('88', 334, 4, 10, 500114) It will be some time before he reaches there.
('88', 334, 4, 11, 500160) I am happy that you have once again taken up public work.

('88', 334, 9, 19, 500455) Did I tell you that I would get you some monetary help from Bapa?
('88', 334, 9, 20, 500521) I don’t remember anything about it.
('88', 334, 9, 21, 500557) My memory has become hopeless.
('88', 334, 9, 22, 500588) If I say something and it is of some use you must get it in writing from me.
('88', 334, 9, 23, 500665) 2 Moreover, Bapa further writes and says that owing to the cold weather the hospital may have to be shifted to some other place or the whole work may have to be stopped.

('88', 335, 12, 17, 501509) BHAI MANGALDAS, I have your letter.
('88', 335, 12, 18, 501545) I see you are working at great speed.
('88', 335, 12, 19, 501583) I on my part am doing what I can from here.
('88', 335, 12, 20, 501627) I have gone through Motilal’s and your opinion.
('88', 335, 12, 21, 501675) I agree with it.
('88', 335, 12, 22, 501692) But there is one thing neither of you appear to have considered.
('88', 335, 12, 23, 501757) The words are: “one should not refuse to sell [khadi] which is worth buying”.
('88', 335, 12, 24, 501835) Now the question is which khadi should be considered “worth buying”.
('88', 335, 12, 25, 501904) One might say that the khadi which had been produced according to the conditions laid down by me was “worth buying”.
('88', 335, 12, 26, 502021) Isn’t that so?
('88', 335, 12, 27, 502036) Why can’t I say that I will sell my khadi only to the person who pays me the highest price for it?
('88', 335, 12, 28, 502135) This gives rise to many more questions but I do not wish to discuss them.
('88', 335, 12, 29, 502209) They are irrelevant at the moment.
('88', 335, 12, 30, 502244) But I have been forced to write this becuase it is not irrelevant to point out the snag which I notice and which prevents me from publishing your views.
('88', 335, 12, 31, 502397) So if it can be put right, I would of course like to get it done, so that it can be published.
('88', 335, 12, 32, 502492) But if there is something wrong in my way of thinking, I should not proceed with it for the moment.

('88', 336, 1, 3, 502694) Sardar and others will be with me.

('88', 336, 1, 5, 502775) Now about Munshi.
('88', 336, 1, 6, 502793) I did not like the article 1 you showed me which appeared in the Chronicle.
('88', 336, 1, 7, 502869) I found malice in it.
('88', 336, 1, 8, 502891) Munshi had come here on business of his own.
('88', 336, 1, 9, 502936) I asked him about it.
('88', 336, 1, 10, 502958) He showed me the mistakes in the article and there were other defects also.
('88', 336, 1, 11, 503034) Even if Jawaharlal had sent a message 2, Munshi did not get it.
('88', 336, 1, 12, 503098) Afterwards Jawaharlal also came and when I asked him he said that he did not have the slightest recollection of having sent a message.
('88', 336, 1, 13, 503233) He might have told somebody to send one but it was of no value.
('88', 336, 1, 14, 503297) The gist of this is that there is very little truth in newspapers and they are full of falsehood.
('88', 336, 1, 15, 503395) If a man acts believing in their veracity he must lose.
('88', 336, 1, 16, 503451) I certainly do not wish to see you lose.

('88', 336, 6, 23, 503714) I like it because you have taken pains to clear your mind.
('88', 336, 6, 24, 503773) I have come to the conclusion that under the circumstances you should not start work in my absence.
('88', 336, 6, 25, 503873) Since you have ordered goods to the value of a thousand rupees, you should first dispose of them and then wash your hands of the ointment business.

('88', 338, 2, 3, 505457) November 15, 1945
('88', 338, 3, 4, 505475) BHAI DASTANE, What can poor Akka 1 or Vatsala 22 tell you?
('88', 338, 3, 5, 505534) All your daughters are good and wish to give you the minimum trouble.
('88', 338, 3, 6, 505604) At the same time they want to take the minimum obligation from others.
('88', 338, 3, 7, 505675) But I know the way they depend on you unknowingly.
('88', 338, 3, 8, 505726) Of course I don’t blame anyone.
('88', 338, 3, 9, 505758) Our circumstances often are such that we cannot get out of them.
('88', 338, 3, 10, 505823) That is why I advise you that you should take up grihasthashrama 3 and the more you purify it and remain pure yourself the better will you serve the country.
('88', 338, 3, 11, 505981) Today we are all intoxicated.
('88', 338, 3, 12, 506011) Intoxication is not always due to liquor, ganja or opium.
('88', 338, 3, 13, 506069) I have seen that being intoxicated with vanity or the craze for swaraj is at times worse than the intoxication of liquor.
('88', 338, 3, 14, 506191) To know our swadharma and to be engrossed in it is our supreme dharma.
('88', 338, 3, 15, 506262) That is why, let me add, I can only discuss things with you but I cannot think as you do.
('88', 338, 3, 16, 506352) Do take as much as you can digest from what I say and go ahead.
('88', 338, 3, 17, 506416) I would suggest you have a talk with the members of the Working Committee.
('88', 338, 3, 18, 506491) I cannot go very far.
('88', 338, 3, 19, 506513) My position is like that of a ‘tenant at will’ 4. The difference is great.
('88', 338, 3, 20, 506588) I am what I am without any conscious effort on my part, and the poor tenant at will desires to stay for ever.
('88', 338, 3, 21, 506698) I came across a sloka by Bhartrihari, “In fact one who is attached to sense objects and one who is free from them are both in the same position.
('88', 338, 3, 22, 506843) The latter voluntarily gives up sense objects and enjoys bliss, while the self indulgent one too has to give up his sensual pleasures every now and then and earns only misery.” Bhartrihari has crammed a great deal of wisdom into this.
('88', 338, 3, 23, 507078) Let us all drink that nectar and attain bliss.

('88', 339, 10, 14, 507798) He appreciated the effort of serving villagers through the health centre and of spreading knowledge of child nursing.
('88', 339, 10, 15, 507916) He remarked that there was ample scope for such work in the seven lakhs of villages of India.2 Gandhiji said:
('88', 339, 11, 16, 508026) To provide facilities for a safe delivery to a few women is a poor

('88', 340, 6, 20, 509720) You must give up the craving for letters in my handwriting.
('88', 340, 6, 21, 509780) I am dictating this lying down in the evening after the prayers.
('88', 340, 6, 22, 509845) Sometimes two line suffice, but at times I have to write at length.
('88', 340, 6, 23, 509913) You had better leave it to me when I should write myself or when and to whom I should dictate.
('88', 340, 6, 24, 510008) Now that you have started the exercise 4 do not give it up.
('88', 340, 6, 25, 510068) You can go up to 108 namaskars.
('88', 340, 6, 26, 510100) Many asanas can be performed while doing suryanamaskar.

('88', 340, 6, 28, 510216) Consider also whether you should go up to 108 namaskars.

('88', 341, 1, 2, 510627) you put on weight, let it be so.
('88', 341, 1, 3, 510660) You need not worry about it in the least.
('88', 341, 1, 4, 510702) You have used the word ‘stunt’ in a wrong context.
('88', 341, 1, 5, 510753) You can translate it as dhating in Gujarati.
('88', 341, 1, 6, 510798) The changes in diet or other methods adopted for reducing weight cannot be called stunt.
('88', 341, 1, 7, 510887) Those who digest what they have studied keep on pursuing the study in order to acquire more knowledge without even thinking about the examination results.
('88', 341, 1, 8, 511042) While studying they build up their bodies as best they can because keeping the body healthy, strong and lustrous is also a part of learning.
('88', 341, 1, 9, 511183) I give you full encouragement to study what you have undertaken not for the sake of getting a degree but for the knowledge that you will acquire while studying for it.
('88', 341, 1, 10, 511351) Since you have already studied Gray 1 once, it should be a mere child’s play to go through it a second time.
('88', 341, 1, 11, 511460) The oftener you read it, the more knowledge you will gain.
('88', 341, 1, 12, 511519) It will be good if you give up the habit of walking about as you read.
('88', 341, 1, 13, 511590) It spoils the eyesight and sometimes the thoughts also wander.
('88', 341, 1, 14, 511653) While walking one can think over and digest what one has read or think of the work one has done during the day, and so on.
('88', 341, 1, 15, 511776) But the eyes have to look around and take note of the surroundings and watch out for any obstruction in one’s way.
('88', 341, 1, 16, 511891) One cannot walk with eyes closed but a person like me who walks with the support of others enjoys the pleasure of doing so.
('88', 341, 1, 17, 512015) But that is not for you.
('88', 341, 1, 18, 512040) Stick to your decision not to attend Lakshmidas’s wedding.

('88', 342, 4, 5, 512411) I have your postcard.
('88', 342, 4, 6, 512433) I have sent the thing on to a historian who has also made a serious study of the Hindu Muslim question.
('88', 342, 4, 7, 512537) I am awaiting his reply.
('88', 342, 4, 8, 512562) A leading Congressman told me that it would not do any good to write anything like this in the name of the Congress because the atmosphere was such that people had shut their ears to objectively expressed views of others and such being the case anything said was bound to be misunderstood.
('88', 342, 4, 9, 512852) Therefore, I am not keen to have this published.
('88', 342, 4, 10, 512901) Seeing the atmosphere that prevails I myself hold a similar view.
('88', 342, 4, 11, 512967) But lest I do injustice to your endeavour I have sent it to a historian for his opinion.
('88', 342, 4, 12, 513056) This much I can say that it will not be possible to have it published as quickly as you want.
('88', 342, 4, 13, 513150) Let us see what comes of it and what I finally decide.
('88', 342, 4, 14, 513205) My visit to Bengal will not be long in coming now.
('88', 342, 4, 15, 513256) I hope to reach there on December 1st.
('88', 342, 4, 16, 513295) Do meet me there.
('88', 342, 4, 17, 513313) Let me, however, tell you that the final decision lies not with those with an English education but with the millions of people who know their mother tongue or the national language.
('88', 342, 4, 18, 513496) Therefore, write the original in your mother tongue, Bengali; and for other provinces in the national language in both the scripts.
('88', 342, 4, 19, 513628) If you agree with what I say, start reading and writing the national language in both the scripts.

('88', 344, 3, 6, 515291) I am interested, if at all, in a caste Hindu marrying a Harijan.
('88', 344, 3, 7, 515356) For, if we wish to observeVarnashrama dharma, we should all belong to one caste, i.e., of Harijans.
('88', 344, 3, 8, 515456) And how else can we prove that we have really become Harijans?
('88', 344, 3, 9, 515519) But what if marriage between a Bhangi and a Brahmin is not for observing dharma but for indulgence?
('88', 344, 3, 10, 515619) All the same you have my blessings if your marriage is for the service of the poeple and if both of you live a life of self restraint.

('88', 344, 9, 18, 515987) Yesterday I could not go where I intended to go, could not do what I intended to do.
('88', 344, 9, 19, 516072) I only watched the tamasha 1. Such things give me a fright.
('88', 344, 9, 20, 516132) I am also past the age when they could interest me.

('88', 344, 9, 22, 516291) I had intended to talk to the doctors and joke with the patients.
('88', 344, 9, 23, 516357) I have to say none of this was done.
('88', 344, 9, 24, 516394) I had especially brought along Nargisbehn.
('88', 344, 9, 25, 516437) She could not see anything.
('88', 344, 9, 26, 516465) I would not take her to watch a tamasha at any time.

('88', 345, 1, 4, 517063) The septic tank is a good device.
('88', 345, 1, 5, 517097) There was some rank grass around and it seems valuable water, containing manure, flowing from the tank is going waste.
('88', 345, 1, 6, 517216) Something had better be done about it.

('88', 345, 7, 16, 517562) Chandu has woken up.

('88', 347, 8, 20, 520324) In a democratic organization and especially one in which violence is eschewed, things will happen as they do.
('88', 347, 8, 21, 520434) But they must come right in the end.

('88', 348, 2, 3, 520803) POONA, November 18, 1945
('88', 348, 3, 4, 520828) JIVANJI, Please read the enclosed letter and return it to me with your opinion on what should be done.
('88', 348, 3, 5, 520931) They have sent the money as royalty on the sales of the translation, but since we are not entitled to it I feel tempted to utilize it for the many other activities under my charge instead of crediting it to the Navajivan account.
('88', 348, 3, 6, 521161) But then I also feel that I had better send it to you.
('88', 348, 3, 7, 521216) I am, therefore, sending the cheque herewith.
('88', 348, 3, 8, 521262) If, now, you yourself feel that the money should not be credited to the Navajivan account, then, and only then, return it to me.
('88', 348, 3, 9, 521391) At present I am spending money as it comes from different accounts.
('88', 348, 3, 10, 521459) I do not see any of these to be specially in need of this money.
('88', 348, 3, 11, 521524) Hence both of us can consider the matter objectively.
('88', 348, 3, 12, 521578) I sent you yesterday the pamphlet on constructive programme after revising it with great labour.
('88', 348, 3, 13, 521675) Inadvertently, it was posted as unregistered packet.
('88', 348, 3, 14, 521728) I shall, therefore, feel worried till I get an acknowledgment from you.
('88', 348, 3, 15, 521800) For I have kept no copy of it.
('88', 348, 3, 16, 521831) But I derive what comfort I can from the story of Newton who, after being slightly upset when the manuscript on which he had been working for many years was destroyed in a fire by somebody, proceeded to write it all over again.
('88', 348, 3, 17, 522059) And with this thought I keep patience.
('88', 348, 3, 18, 522098) I hope it will not be lost on the way.
('88', 348, 3, 19, 522137) But if it is, I will revise another copy.
('88', 348, 3, 20, 522179) It will mean loss of some time, of course.
('88', 348, 3, 21, 522222) If, therefore, you receive it safely, spend money on a wire, but if you don’t get it send another copy with your suggestions so that I may start work on it immediately.

('88', 349, 3, 6, 522752) “As ye sow, so shall ye reap” is a law without exception.

('88', 350, 6, 12, 524226) But that is all right.
('88', 350, 6, 13, 524249) I am replying now.
('88', 350, 6, 14, 524268) 1. I regard Prakash as my daughter.
('88', 350, 6, 15, 524304) There was no idea of pleasing anybody in allowing her to touch me.
('88', 350, 6, 16, 524371) I decided that she should remain with me while I stayed in Calcutta and then should accompany me to Santiniketan, nowhere else.
('88', 350, 6, 17, 524499) I still think the same today.
('88', 350, 6, 18, 524529) Let her come to Calcutta.
('88', 350, 6, 19, 524555) Then we shall see what happens.
('88', 350, 6, 20, 524587) 2. I shall arrange Rs. 25/ a month to be sent to you if you so wish.
('88', 350, 6, 21, 524656) 3. I do not see any need for Sushila to write to Manu.
('88', 350, 6, 22, 524711) However, if Sushila herself feels that she should send the letter, or another letter, she is free to do so.
('88', 350, 6, 23, 524819) I am firmly of opinion that it is in her interest and in the interest of everyone that among the three of us only I should correspond with her.
('88', 350, 6, 24, 524963) I do not think it is necessary to send either of the books to Manu now.
('88', 350, 6, 25, 525035) But I shall let her know that you have given me the books to be sent to her.
('88', 350, 6, 26, 525112) I shall do as she desires.
('88', 350, 6, 27, 525139) That would be best.
('88', 350, 6, 28, 525159) I feel that it would be somewhat rude to send her the books just like that.
('88', 350, 6, 29, 525235) Now that I am writing, let me state that I had understood your wish that I should not use for you terms like ‘poet’ and so on.
('88', 350, 6, 30, 525362) You did not know the full context.
('88', 350, 6, 31, 525397) Still, I shall be as cautious as I can be.

('88', 351, 2, 3, 525680) POONA, November, 18, 1945
('88', 351, 3, 4, 525706) GHANSHYAMDAS, I have no doubt that you have done everything possible with regard to the land at Nasik.
('88', 351, 3, 5, 525809) Dinshaw is an eccentric man but he is very good, generous and simple hearted.
('88', 351, 3, 6, 525887) In the matter of nature cure he is the only man on whom my eyes are fixed.
('88', 351, 3, 7, 525962) I shall go on encouraging him in his virtues and, if I can do so, it will be of much help to the patients.
('88', 351, 3, 8, 526069) Therefore, when I saw that he was himself not keen on going to Nasik, I dropped the matter.
('88', 351, 3, 9, 526161) With that I also decided to begin the new term of the institution from here and run it for the poor.
('88', 351, 3, 10, 526262) So far only the rich have come and the poor have remained behind.
('88', 351, 3, 11, 526328) But now the rich who wish to be admitted here will have to come after the poor.
('88', 351, 3, 12, 526408) The rich will get the same facilities as the poor.
('88', 351, 3, 13, 526459) At the same time it is certain that an attempt will be made to observe the rules of cleanliness as meticulously as possible.
('88', 351, 3, 14, 526584) No doubt it is a difficult task.
('88', 351, 3, 15, 526617) I should not cultivate such an interest in my declining years.
('88', 351, 3, 16, 526680) But what lay dormant for years has awakened without any effort on my part.
('88', 351, 3, 17, 526755) How can I resist it?
('88', 351, 3, 18, 526776) God’s will alone will prevail.
('88', 351, 3, 19, 526807) For the time being the insti tution of which you too are a trustee has been closed.
('88', 351, 3, 20, 526891) If it is to come into existence out of the activities here, it will.
('88', 351, 3, 21, 526960) Whatever happens will be proper from all points of view.
('88', 351, 3, 22, 527017) I shall write to you if I have to go to Nasik or need money to carry on this institution.
('88', 351, 3, 23, 527107) At present I am just watching.
('88', 351, 3, 24, 527138) There is some money lying with me.
('88', 351, 3, 25, 527173) I shall manage with it.
('88', 351, 3, 26, 527197) Since it is the condition of this trust that the management will not be left in Dinshaw’s hands, you may as well say that the responsibility will mine.
('88', 351, 3, 27, 527349) I have read Shivnath Singh’s letter you sent me.
('88', 351, 3, 28, 527398) It did not make a favourable impression on me.
('88', 351, 3, 29, 527445) He has written at great length 1. I am writing a brief note to him.

('88', 355, 8, 20, 531665) The biggest problem is the condition you have laid down.

('88', 355, 8, 22, 531764) I can speak for myself and I think I have already conveyed 1

('88', 355, 9, 24, 531960) I still think as I have said earlier, that only if all the communities are first united at heart and wish to sit together and decide the issue will it be possible to frame a constitution.
('88', 355, 9, 25, 532148) So what the Congress will do is beside the point.

('88', 356, 5, 9, 532854) BOMBAY, [Novemeber 19, 1945] 1
('88', 356, 6, 10, 532885) To a questions why the Urdu script should be imposed on a person who did not like it and wished to learn the national language only through the Devanagari script, Mahatma Gandhi replied: It is not a question of liking or disliking.
('88', 356, 6, 11, 533117) If you do not like the Urdu script, then I conclude that you do not like Hindustani.
('88', 356, 6, 12, 533202) The Urdu script must be learnt.
('88', 356, 6, 13, 533234) Without effort and sacrifice we cannot dream of winning freedom.
('88', 356, 6, 14, 533299) So far as the provinces of Bombay, Gujarat and Maharashtra are concerned, the question of learning the Nagari script does not arise at all as everybody knows it already.
('88', 356, 6, 15, 533469) Then, where does Hindustani Prachar come in?
('88', 356, 6, 16, 533514) In learning the other script, do not think you are conferring a favour on anyone.
('88', 356, 6, 17, 533596) It should be considered as your duty.
('88', 356, 6, 18, 533634) It is a national work and everyone should do it.
('88', 356, 6, 19, 533683) By learning both the scripts you can better understand both the Hindi and the Urdu developments of the language.
('88', 356, 6, 20, 533796) I can understand Sanskritized Hindi, but what about the masses?
('88', 356, 6, 21, 533860) It is our duty to learn both the scripts.
('88', 356, 6, 22, 533902) Then alone can we hoenstly serve the country in a humble way.
('88', 356, 6, 23, 533964) According to me one who does not have a liking for the Urdu script has no liking for swaraj also.
('88', 356, 6, 24, 534062) The masses do not understand pure Hindi or pure Urdu, so Hindustani should be evolved in such a way that even the illiterate masses can understand it.
('88', 356, 6, 25, 534213) Mere slogans would not help in achieving the goal of freedom.
('88', 356, 6, 26, 534275) Taking as little trouble as possible and looking to your worldly advancement will leave your swaraj just a dream.
('88', 356, 6, 27, 534389) Nagari and Urdu are

('88', 357, 1, 2, 534491) both equally dear to me.
('88', 357, 1, 3, 534516) So when I say learn the Urdu script I have no enmity towards the other script.
('88', 357, 1, 4, 534595) Our swaraj cannot be given to us as a gift, but we shall have to win it through our untiring efforts.
('88', 357, 1, 5, 534697) To understand our people and win swaraj for our country, do not be deterred from this small effort of learning the two important scripts of our land.
('88', 357, 1, 6, 534847) To keep faith, one must be cent per cent faithful.
('88', 357, 1, 7, 534898) It is not a bit of bread which you can break up in pieces.
('88', 357, 1, 8, 534957) The language of a people cannot be divided, it is one and indivisible like Truth.
('88', 357, 1, 9, 535039) Therefore, whether you like it or not you will have to learn and love Urdu.
('88', 357, 2, 10, 535115) Asked whether script should be given as much importance as language, Gandhiji replied: Language and script are both necessary in practice.
('88', 357, 2, 11, 535254) How are we, after all, to solve the question of writing to our own Muslim brethren who know only the other script?
('88', 357, 2, 12, 535369) If we argue, ‘What have we to do with them?’, then I say why bother about swaraj?
('88', 357, 2, 13, 535451) I want to learn all the thirteen scripts and want to know them equally well.
('88', 357, 2, 14, 535528) Had you given one seventh of the time to the learning of these scripts which you have given to English, you would have learnt all the thirteen scripts by now.
('88', 357, 2, 15, 535687) It is not difficult to learn the Urdu script.
('88', 357, 2, 16, 535733) It can be done with great ease and facility.
('88', 357, 3, 17, 535778) A pracharak asked why the Urdu script should not be taught to the student after the Nagari is learnt.
('88', 357, 3, 18, 535880) Mahatma said: If I had been a teacher, I would have taught four or five scripts at the same time.
('88', 357, 3, 19, 535978) I did not take even eight days to learn the Urdu script.
('88', 357, 3, 20, 536035) There should at least be four or five such teachers who may know the two script perfectly and may be able to teach them.
('88', 357, 3, 21, 536156) It could be left to the option of the teacher whether he taught the two scripts together or one after the other.
('88', 357, 3, 22, 536269) But he should examine them in both before giving them a certificate.
('88', 357, 4, 23, 536338) Regarding the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan and Babu Purushottam Das Tandon’s attitude to the script issue, Mahatma Gandhi said: Tandonji is my friend.
('88', 357, 4, 24, 536483) I love him.
('88', 357, 4, 25, 536495) We have lived together for a long time.
('88', 357, 4, 26, 536535) But now, on this question, we are taking two different paths; but we do not stand in each other’s way.
('88', 357, 4, 27, 536638) Personally, for myself, I want to see Saraswati after the union of Ganga and Jamuna.

('88', 358, 3, 9, 537215) Excuse me for not replying in English.

('88', 358, 6, 15, 537525) WARDHA, November 21, 1945 I had purposely refrained from correcting or contradicting reports about my shifting to Poona and establishing a nature cure hospital on an extensive plot of ground in Poona or even Nasik.
('88', 358, 6, 16, 537740) All this was wrong, as most unauthentic reports in the Press are.
('88', 358, 6, 17, 537806) These have always cost me dear, perhaps the public more than me.
('88', 358, 6, 18, 537871) There was, however, a grain of truth in the ounce of rumour.
('88', 358, 6, 19, 537932) Dr. Dinshaw Mehta knew me before I knew him and, ever since I have known him, I have liked him.
('88', 358, 6, 20, 538028) I have been myself a nature cure man before all known to me.
('88', 358, 6, 21, 538089) Of them, Dr. Dinshaw has made the greatest impression on me and he is a dreamer like me.
('88', 358, 6, 22, 538178) He wants a nature cure university; so do I. He has made over to a Trust his concerns at Poona and Sinhgad.
('88', 358, 6, 23, 538285) Their nominal cost, according to the schedules to the Trust, is, in round figures, Rs. 50,000. I have allowed myself to be one of the Trustees.
('88', 358, 6, 24, 538429) The other two are Dr. Mehta himself and Mr. Jehangir Patel who is interested in nature cure.
('88', 358, 6, 25, 538522) Hitherto Dr. Mehta’s institution has been meant for monied men and then for as many poor people as he could safely take.
('88', 358, 6, 26, 538643) Patients have all been residential.
('88', 358, 6, 27, 538679) From the 1st of January next, this institution will be devoted to
('88', 359, 0, 1, 538745) 360 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('88', 359, 1, 2, 538787) the service of the poor.
('88', 359, 1, 3, 538812) The rich will be taken only if they can accommodate themselves to remain with the poor, and expect no more space or comforts than the poor will get at this institution.
('88', 359, 1, 4, 538981) The guarantee will be that the standard of cleanliness, shorn of luxury, will be the highest attainable in any institution of the kind.
('88', 359, 1, 5, 539117) Treatment will be both indoor and outdoor.
('88', 359, 1, 6, 539160) Outdoor will naturally be more than indoor.
('88', 359, 1, 7, 539204) The Birlas have interested themselves in me for years.
('88', 359, 1, 8, 539259) And they were prepared to give me in Nasik as much land with buildings as were required for the institution.
('88', 359, 1, 9, 539368) But Dr. Dinshaw was not whole heartedly inclined to favour the Nasik idea, unless I consented to include in the Trust the going concerns at Poona too.
('88', 359, 1, 10, 539519) I could not shoulder the burden.
('88', 359, 1, 11, 539552) Hence the Nasik project had to be dropped, for the time being at any rate.
('88', 359, 1, 12, 539627) 1 Dr. Dinshaw will still remain the sole Director so far as the technical part is concerned.
('88', 359, 1, 13, 539720) This institution, if it is to grow at all, will require the silent blessings of the poor, the financial support of the rich, active co operation of genuine naturopaths of India and sympathy of the medical fraternity.
('88', 359, 1, 14, 539937) Its present site is too small for the requirements of the poor.
('88', 359, 1, 15, 540001) Moreover, it will largely depend upon the leaseholder whether the institution can in any case remain located on the present site.

('88', 360, 7, 11, 541058) And when the Sardar is there what more can one want?
('88', 360, 7, 12, 541111) I have secured the books you recommended.
('88', 360, 7, 13, 541153) I do want to glance through them but what am I to do?
('88', 360, 7, 14, 541207) Please send Joad’s book when you come across it.

('88', 360, 12, 24, 541703) SEVAGRAM, November 22, 1945
('88', 360, 13, 25, 541731) KAMALNAYAN, Since you will certainly not be back before I leave Sevagram, I am writing you this letter.
('88', 360, 13, 26, 541835) You should know that the Nagpur Bank was Jamanalal’s, which he had started for the service of the people.
('88', 360, 14, 27, 541941) 1 Charles Hodge
('88', 361, 0, 1, 541957) 362 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('88', 361, 1, 2, 541999) idea was, and ought to be even now, that it should serve as a savings bank for the poor.
('88', 361, 1, 3, 542088) The bank, therefore, must never crash.
('88', 361, 1, 4, 542127) In other words, the Nagpur Bank should crash only when the Bank of England or the Imperial Bank do or when there is some great natural calamity.
('88', 361, 1, 5, 542272) That is, it must have the reputation that it will be the last not the first to crash.
('88', 361, 1, 6, 542358) That you are Jamnalal’s heir really means that you are heir to that reputation, and it was because of this belief of mine that I advised the Jallianwala Trust to let its funds remain in the Nagpur Bank and to try to transfer still more deposits to it.
('88', 361, 1, 7, 542610) I have given the same advice to Kumarappa, nemely, that he should deposit the Village Industries Association’s funds in that Bank.
('88', 361, 1, 8, 542741) That confidence must not prove to have been misplaced.
('88', 361, 1, 9, 542796) But the moment I alighted at the railway station yesterday Bharatan told me quite the opposite.
('88', 361, 1, 10, 542892) He of course spoke gently and since I am the President of the Association, asked for my opinion.
('88', 361, 1, 11, 542989) Kumarappa had written to me and asked me whether he should deposit the Village Industries funds in the .
('88', 361, 1, 12, 543094) 1 Bank.
('88', 361, 1, 13, 543102) Vaikunthbhai had advised in favour of it and, therefore, Kumarappa had assumed that I also would agree.
('88', 361, 1, 14, 543206) But I expressed doubt and did not give my consent.
('88', 361, 1, 15, 543257) Kumarappa, however, had already deposited the money.
('88', 361, 1, 16, 543310) But now we must withdraw it.
('88', 361, 1, 17, 543339) In that case we shall lose the interest.
('88', 361, 1, 18, 543380) And what if, despite our readiness to lose the interest, we cannot withdraw it.
('88', 361, 1, 19, 543460) So Bharatan asked my advice.
('88', 361, 1, 20, 543489) Kumarappa, is not here just now.
('88', 361, 1, 21, 543522) But I told Bharatan that if the Bank people objected, we must put up a fight and insist on withdrawing the money, for otherwise I felt the money was insecure and it would be like killing a buffalo for a leather thong.
('88', 361, 1, 22, 543740) I do not know even today what kind of an establishment the .
('88', 361, 1, 23, 543801) Bank is.
('88', 361, 1, 24, 543810) I do have some vague idea about it, of course.
('88', 361, 1, 25, 543857) But I generally dislike and distrust new banks.
('88', 361, 1, 26, 543905) I would not, therefore, readily agree to deposit money in them.
('88', 361, 1, 27, 543969) Then the question arose: if not in the .
('88', 361, 1, 28, 544010) Bank, why should we keep the money in the Nagpur Bank?
('88', 361, 1, 29, 544065) Is it also not a comparatively new bank?
('88', 361, 1, 30, 544106) Comparatively yes.
('88', 361, 1, 31, 544125) Bharatan then added that it was being rumoured that the Nagpur Bank would close down in a month or two because it had incurred losses and it was feared that the deposits were not safe.
('88', 361, 1, 32, 544310) He suggested, therefore, that it would be wise to withdraw the money in time.
('88', 361, 1, 33, 544388) I did not believe the rumour and remained undisturbed in my mind, but I wanted to know what was at the back of the rumour.
('88', 361, 1, 34, 544511) Radhakrishna was with me at the time.
('88', 361, 1, 35, 544549) I asked him.
('88', 361, 1, 36, 544562) He explained the position.
('88', 361, 1, 37, 544589) I felt reassured and told Bharatan that we must deposit the money in the Nagpur Bank and nowhere else.
('88', 361, 1, 38, 544692) However, I felt that I must inform you.
('88', 361, 1, 39, 544732) Hence this letter.
('88', 361, 1, 40, 544751) Think over this and be on your guard.
('88', 361, 1, 41, 544789) It is no

('88', 362, 0, 1, 544839) VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 6 DECEMBER, 1945 363
('88', 362, 1, 2, 544885) ordinary matter to be Jamnalal’s heir.
('88', 362, 1, 3, 544924) You are his heir because you are his son.
('88', 362, 1, 4, 544966) I am his heir because I am his adopted father.
('88', 362, 1, 5, 545013) My interest is to see that his name remains untarnished.
('88', 362, 1, 6, 545070) You and I shall have proved ourselves his true heirs only if the ventures he started are not merely kept up but become models of their kind.
('88', 362, 1, 7, 545211) It may be that you will earn a lot of money and be reckoned a millionaire.
('88', 362, 1, 8, 545286) But what is to happen to the philanthropic ventures and the Bank he started in the last years of his life?
('88', 362, 1, 9, 545393) What is to happen to the cause of the poor cow, of khadi, of the Village Industries Association?
('88', 362, 1, 10, 545490) Did I not settle at Wardha at his behest, ignoring Sardar’s anger born out of his love?
('88', 362, 1, 11, 545578) He could have easily secured for me ten orchards against one here, but he could not find for me a Jamnalal there and, therefore, I let go the ten orchards.
('88', 362, 1, 12, 545734) And now, I do not wish even to feel that I have lost Jamnalal.
('88', 362, 1, 13, 545797) This rests entirely in your hands, in Radhakrishna’s and Janakidevi’s.
('88', 362, 1, 14, 545868) Janakidevi, however, is uneducated and the hope of her shaping up which I had cherished has dried up after Jamnalal’s passing away.
('88', 362, 1, 15, 546000) I therefore cannot explain to her the position about the Bank and have not even tried.
('88', 362, 1, 16, 546087) Radhakrishna is very clever.
('88', 362, 1, 17, 546116) He has practical sense but cannot be said to be educated.
('88', 362, 1, 18, 546174) You have been to England and have, besides, made some mark as a business man.
('88', 362, 1, 19, 546252) As for self confidence, you have more of it than is good for you.
('88', 362, 1, 20, 546318) Be that as it may, as heir to Jamnalal and head of the family it is to you that I have to look up.
('88', 362, 1, 21, 546417) I, therefore, advise you to do the best you can to bring glory to your father’s name as a philanthropist.
('88', 362, 1, 22, 546523) If you think it beyond your capacity, be humble and caution me in time.
('88', 362, 1, 23, 546595) Not all sons can or do follow in the footsteps of their benevolent fathers.
('88', 362, 1, 24, 546671) If, therefore, you also fail to do so, nobody can point a finger at you.
('88', 362, 1, 25, 546744) And in any case who am I to do so?
('88', 362, 1, 26, 546779) But as a grandfather I should at least advise you and caution you.
('88', 362, 1, 27, 546846) Having done so, I would quietly accept what you do.
('88', 362, 1, 28, 546898) I think I have said enough.
('88', 362, 1, 29, 546926) Ponder over it carefully and let me know, at any rate, whether the advice I have given to Bharatan is correct or not.

('88', 363, 1, 2, 547150) 675. TALK TO STUDENTS OF SAMAGRA GRAMSEVA VIDYALAYA 1
('88', 363, 2, 3, 547204) SEVAGRAM, November 22, 1945
('88', 363, 3, 4, 547232) I expect much from the students who have come here for study.
('88', 363, 3, 5, 547294) Not only I but also those who take interest in this work, expect much from you.
('88', 363, 3, 6, 547374) There are many educated people in India who criticize and run down our programme.
('88', 363, 3, 7, 547456) Some of them oppose it on principle.
('88', 363, 3, 8, 547493) At present I do not want to say anything about them, though I have a ready answer for them.
('88', 363, 3, 9, 547585) But we should listen to those who have some interest in this work and wish to take some part in it.
('88', 363, 3, 10, 547685) Such people hope for much from khadi work, village industries, goseva and work of Harijan uplift.
('88', 363, 3, 11, 547783) We should therefore make strenuous efforts to fulfil their expectations.
('88', 363, 3, 12, 547856) If you have come here in order merely to earn your livelihood, then that hope will not be realized.
('88', 363, 3, 13, 547956) Many people study in Government colleges.
('88', 363, 3, 14, 547998) They get degrees there.
('88', 363, 3, 15, 548022) They think that with that education they will earn money and fame and at least become clerks in some Government office, or if not, they can certainly get jobs as peons.
('88', 363, 3, 16, 548191) And they become peons not for the sake of work, but in the hope of getting promotions in future and making some money on the side.
('88', 363, 3, 17, 548322) This means that they believe that once they enter Government service, their life is secure.
('88', 363, 3, 18, 548414) This is a matter which needs careful thinking.
('88', 363, 3, 19, 548461) The Government has provided several facilities in their colleges.
('88', 363, 3, 20, 548527) They have provided spacious buildings, offered large scholarships and given travelling facilities.
('88', 363, 3, 21, 548626) How can we compete with all this?
('88', 363, 3, 22, 548660) I have already shown several ways of solving this problem.
('88', 363, 3, 23, 548719) You have not come here for comforts or for the sake of salary.
('88', 363, 3, 24, 548782) If you want to succeed in your aim bear in mind that you have not come here merely to learn crafts.
('88', 363, 3, 25, 548882) Of course you have to learn crafts but you should not rest content with that.
('88', 363, 3, 26, 548960) Artisans are already there in villages.
('88', 363, 3, 27, 549000) They have been doing the same work from generation to generation.
('88', 363, 3, 28, 549066) How can you compete with them?
('88', 363, 3, 29, 549097) Do learn the process, but along with that you must acquire scientific knowledge.
('88', 363, 3, 30, 549178) We should think again and again why we are doing this work, how we should proceed about it, how we can link it with swaraj.
('88', 363, 3, 31, 549302) Swaraj has to be attained through non violence.
('88', 363, 3, 32, 549350) There are crores of people living in the villages of

('88', 364, 1, 2, 549509) We have to emancipate them, serve them and make them understand the value of this work.
('88', 364, 1, 3, 549597) If you believe that the mill owners can feed the people and if you are satisfied with it then you should not study here.
('88', 364, 1, 4, 549718) But the mill owners can provide for only a handful.
('88', 364, 1, 5, 549770) Mill owners never think at all of the crores of people.
('88', 364, 1, 6, 549826) I have not come across any mill owner so far who has told me that mills can provide work for the millions.
('88', 364, 1, 7, 549933) You have come here to accomplish a Herculean task.
('88', 364, 1, 8, 549984) You have to serve crores of people.
('88', 364, 1, 9, 550020) It is immaterial that you are only sixty one in number.
('88', 364, 1, 10, 550076) But you will have accomplished something if you leave after gaining scientific knowledge.
('88', 364, 1, 11, 550166) All the sixty one of you have to become guardians or trustees for the millions of people.
('88', 364, 1, 12, 550256) If your example is followed, the number will increase.
('88', 364, 1, 13, 550311) This Vidyalaya is like the Gangotri 1. Its flow will swell like that of the Ganga.
('88', 364, 1, 14, 550394) This has been my dream for the last 25 years.
('88', 364, 1, 15, 550440) The hope that I have cherished has not yet been fulfilled.
('88', 364, 1, 16, 550499) Still I am not disappointed at all because I never lose heart.
('88', 364, 1, 17, 550562) A great enterprise does not move quickly.
('88', 364, 1, 18, 550604) Non violence marches forward slowly but steadily.
('88', 364, 1, 19, 550654) Its way is straight.
('88', 364, 1, 20, 550675) It will overtake those who move with the speed of an aeroplane.
('88', 364, 1, 21, 550739) This is my firm belief.
('88', 364, 1, 22, 550763) The knowledge that you gain here is to be imparted to the villa gers.
('88', 364, 1, 23, 550833) You have to create interest in them for such knowledge.
('88', 364, 1, 24, 550889) But this is not an easy task.
('88', 364, 1, 25, 550919) I have been here in Sevagram for the last so many years.
('88', 364, 1, 26, 550976) The headquarters of the Charkha Sangh, Gramodyog Sangh, Goseva Sangh and so on are situated here.
('88', 364, 1, 27, 551074) There are very good workers also.
('88', 364, 1, 28, 551108) The facilities that are not available anywhere else are available here.
('88', 364, 1, 29, 551180) In spite of all this, I have not been able to do what I wanted to do.
('88', 364, 1, 30, 551250) But you should not lose heart because of that.
('88', 364, 1, 31, 551297) You should ask yourselves why we have not been able to do it.
('88', 364, 1, 32, 551359) The teachers should have an answer for this.
('88', 364, 1, 33, 551404) Those who are sitting here are neither hypocrites nor cheats.
('88', 364, 1, 34, 551466) They are sitting here with a firm belief that sooner or later the key to this problem will come into their hands.
('88', 364, 1, 35, 551580) We have to multiply Sevagrams.
('88', 364, 1, 36, 551611) We have to think not of a single village but the whole of India.
('88', 364, 1, 37, 551676) I sometimes think of the whole world as well.
('88', 364, 1, 38, 551722) If we had to take care of Sevagram only or had to work without concern for non violence and truth, then we could have accomplished the work but that would not have removed the sufferings of this world.
('88', 364, 1, 39, 551924) India is a tiny spot in the world and in it Sevagram is but a speck.
('88', 364, 1, 40, 551993) Whatever is possible in Sevagram can also be possible in the world.
('88', 364, 1, 41, 552061) I am prepared to spend 100 years for it.
('88', 364, 1, 42, 552102) I shall teach you whatever I know if you are prepared to learn it

('88', 365, 1, 2, 552253) with patience.
('88', 365, 1, 3, 552268) But it will not help you to earn money.
('88', 365, 1, 4, 552308) I can easily earn a thousand or two thousand rupees.
('88', 365, 1, 5, 552361) I stayed for 20 years in South Africa, I can speak some broken English also.
('88', 365, 1, 6, 552438) Moreover, these days I am considered a mahatma too !
('88', 365, 1, 7, 552491) So anybody will give me two thousand rupees.
('88', 365, 1, 8, 552536) But I don’t want all this.
('88', 365, 1, 9, 552563) On the strength of it I can collect crores of rupees, but not for myself.
('88', 365, 1, 10, 552637) So far as I am concerned I want nothing more than plain bread.
('88', 365, 1, 11, 552700) In the same way you should also be content with plain bread.
('88', 365, 1, 12, 552761) The work here is not easy.
('88', 365, 1, 13, 552788) If you are not satisfied with the work here you should leave.
('88', 365, 1, 14, 552850) You can earn enough money elsewhere but if you wish to stay here, you should stay with a contented mind.
('88', 365, 1, 15, 552955) If you have this feeling that you are one with the millions, then you will succeed.
('88', 365, 1, 16, 553039) You have come here from different Provinces.
('88', 365, 1, 17, 553084) You eat together and live together.
('88', 365, 1, 18, 553120) Your heart should be clean and you should feel that we are all one.
('88', 365, 1, 19, 553188) I have started saying that we are all Harijans—indeed Bhangis.
('88', 365, 1, 20, 553251) Only when you imbibe such an attitude, will our work succeed.
('88', 365, 1, 21, 553313) You will have to be alert every moment and carry on the work.
('88', 365, 1, 22, 553375) You will be examined and you will be given a certificate.
('88', 365, 1, 23, 553433) But that will not prove your worth.
('88', 365, 1, 24, 553469) The certificate will not be for showing to others.
('88', 365, 1, 25, 553520) It will enable you to know that you have reached a certain standard and that you have to proceed further.
('88', 365, 1, 26, 553626) Today certificates do carry weight but we have to change our values, change our way of life and also our attitude towards these things.

('88', 365, 5, 33, 553945) I had expected to see you here, instead of which I saw your letter full of real distress.
('88', 365, 5, 34, 554035) It was not the lamentation usual in your letters.
('88', 365, 5, 35, 554085) I felt in it, instead, your sorrow at having fallen ill at the wrong moment.
('88', 365, 5, 36, 554162) I too, therefore, felt unhappy.
('88', 365, 5, 37, 554194) Maganbhai 1, too, gave me a vivid description.

('88', 366, 7, 14, 554896) You have too many advisers.
('88', 366, 7, 15, 554924) That is bad.
('88', 366, 7, 16, 554937) You should listen only to one person whom you respect and follow his advice.
('88', 366, 7, 17, 555014) Do not listen to anybody else, and if someone comes to talk to you just close your ears.
('88', 366, 7, 18, 555103) You will then quickly recover.
('88', 366, 7, 19, 555134) And don’t worry in any case.
('88', 366, 7, 20, 555163) Since you have given birth to a child, you must bring him up well.

('88', 366, 13, 27, 555517) I got all your letters and Dr. Sharma’s and quite a number of them, I may say, but I did not think it proper to get involved in all these things.
('88', 366, 13, 28, 555663) Now I see that I shall have to devote some time to the matter.
('88', 366, 13, 29, 555726) You emphatically proclaim your honesty and I have as yet no reason to doubt it.
('88', 366, 13, 30, 555806) You have already given me the reason for believing that your conscience is clear and I have accepted it despite opposition from others.

('88', 367, 1, 4, 556173) He insists that it should be sent to you.
('88', 367, 1, 5, 556215) You can give whatever reply you want to and send it along with his letter.
('88', 367, 1, 6, 556290) I am writing this letter with a heavy heart.
('88', 367, 1, 7, 556335) Dr. Sharma’s complaint is not a new one.
('88', 367, 1, 8, 556376) He had the same complaint when he had come to see me a few months after my release from jail.
('88', 367, 1, 9, 556470) But I did not pay much attention to it.

('88', 370, 2, 3, 559904) SEVAGRAM, November 25, 1945
('88', 370, 3, 4, 559932) DEAR SIR EVAN, I write this in continuation of my letter 1 of 10th October.
('88', 370, 3, 5, 560008) Since then I have seen other such accounts in the papers and now I have with me a young man (Shri Prabhu Dayal Vidyarthi) who came to me while he was yet in his teens, without being recommended by anybody, as a poor youngster.
('88', 370, 3, 6, 560235) This was in the year 1935. Ever since then he has never been out of my observation.
('88', 370, 3, 7, 560319) He was arrested in connection with the 1942 disturbances, and has lately been discharged.
('88', 370, 3, 8, 560409) He came to Wardha in a dilapidated condition.
('88', 370, 3, 9, 560455) I was then at Poona.
('88', 370, 3, 10, 560476) He reported his arrival and I telegraphed to him to come there so that I could look after him better and, if necessary, get Dr. Mehta’s assistance at his sanatorium where I was staying.
('88', 370, 3, 11, 560662) He narrates tales of terrible torture, into the details of which I do not wish to go at this stage.
('88', 370, 4, 12, 560762) On top of this I have received a communication from Dr. Lohia’s friends and they tell me that Dr. Lohia has gone through torture himself.
('88', 370, 4, 13, 560900) He is an able, cultured man who sacrificed a position of ease and luxury for the sake of the cause of India’s independence.
('88', 370, 4, 14, 561024) I know him well and, through him, also his father.
('88', 370, 4, 15, 561075) It is difficult to disbelieve all the accounts that have appeared in the Press and the two incidents mentioned above.
('88', 370, 4, 16, 561193) I suggest that His Excellency goes deeper into the matter and not reject the statements as an exag geration undeserving of any attention.
('88', 370, 4, 17, 561331) I take comfort from the fact that in your letter of 1st November in reply to mine of 10th October, you tell 3 me that though His Excellency believes the story to be exaggerated, he is making further investigations.
('88', 370, 4, 18, 561546) I plead for investigation into all other such statements and, if he proposes to do so, I am prepared to send you such details as I possess about the two

('88', 372, 2, 9, 563766) Do send a reply that the ban should be lifted and the State Congress should be recognized.
('88', 372, 2, 10, 563857) For the rest Jawaharlalji should be consulted.

('88', 372, 6, 15, 564028) MANI, I got your two letters.
('88', 372, 6, 16, 564058) I am sending you the letter meant for Kanjibhai 2. Post it along with your letter.
('88', 372, 6, 17, 564141) Ask them to consider one thing about the Yeravda Pact.
('88', 372, 6, 18, 564196) It has a provision regarding ten years’ limit.
('88', 372, 6, 19, 564243) But it is not there in the 1935 Act.
('88', 372, 6, 20, 564280) Can it, then, be legally enforced?
('88', 372, 6, 21, 564315) Let Pakvasa 3 think about it.
('88', 372, 6, 22, 564345) He may, if necessary, consult counsel.
('88', 372, 6, 23, 564384) My own view is clear.
('88', 372, 6, 24, 564406) The law will not help.
('88', 372, 6, 25, 564429) But there can be no two opinions that politically we can fight.
('88', 372, 6, 26, 564493) It will have to be considered, of course, whether it would be advisable to raise the issue just now.
('88', 372, 6, 27, 564594) But we shall discuss this after you arrive here.

('88', 373, 8, 18, 565537) You should have a frank talk with him.
('88', 373, 8, 19, 565576) I am of course going to do that.
('88', 373, 8, 20, 565609) Others also who criticize him must write plainly.
('88', 373, 8, 21, 565659) I know of no case where mincing of words has cured anyone.
('88', 373, 8, 22, 565718) My impression is that it makes people worse.
('88', 373, 8, 23, 565763) To make indirect suggestions and then expect good results means that for the sake of improving something, one may do wrong and speak untruth.
('88', 373, 8, 24, 565905) I received Kunvarji’s letter.

('88', 374, 8, 14, 566642) I did not know you had such a sense of humour.
('88', 374, 8, 15, 566689) I was very happy to learn that you had made one of the rooms shine like a mirror.
('88', 374, 8, 16, 566771) Do the same with the other rooms and all of you then use them as mirrors.
('88', 374, 8, 17, 566845) This will save the expense on a mirror.
('88', 374, 8, 18, 566885) You slept a lot.
('88', 374, 8, 19, 566902) If you keep sleeping like that, you will recover quickly.

('88', 375, 3, 4, 567273) KRISHNACHANDRA,
('88', 375, 4, 5, 567289) Champabehn 1 is going to stay here in the same way as the others do.
('88', 375, 4, 6, 567358) About Sarala’s education I have made it clear to her that while she stays here, she can neither have tuition from outside nor expect any other special facilities.
('88', 375, 4, 7, 567521) She can receive only the education available here and she has to do as much work for the Ashram as her body will permit.
('88', 375, 4, 8, 567642) She will have to be content with the food provided here and she will have to bear all expenses.
('88', 375, 4, 9, 567738) She already knows spinning and other activities.
('88', 375, 4, 10, 567787) 1. Efforts should be made gently to make Kanjibhai abide by the rules or else he must be suffered with love.
('88', 375, 4, 11, 567896) Only love can understand the language of love.
('88', 375, 4, 12, 567943) It would be a crime to make a mechanical approach.
('88', 375, 4, 13, 567994) 2. I have already had a talk with Kailasbehn.
('88', 375, 4, 14, 568040) She will stay in the Ashram.
('88', 375, 4, 15, 568069) This is a similar problem.
('88', 375, 4, 16, 568096) Here too the key lies in love.
('88', 375, 4, 17, 568127) The same applies to Om Prakash.
('88', 375, 4, 18, 568159) 3. I would love to keep Govind in the Talimi Sangh but only if Sankaran is convinced.
('88', 375, 4, 19, 568245) 4. I do not know anything about Mavjibhai.
('88', 375, 4, 20, 568288) I have just met him and his wife.
('88', 375, 4, 21, 568322) With regard to them do what Kishorelalbhai and Naraharibhai say.
('88', 375, 4, 22, 568387) 5. There is nothing to be said about Govind Reddy.
('88', 375, 4, 23, 568438) 6. I should be happy to make the acquaintance of Mohan Singhji 2 but I have no time.
('88', 375, 4, 24, 568523) I would like to utilize his services as a blacksmith and carpenter.
('88', 375, 4, 25, 568591) 7. While looking after the management, it will be good if you can take classes in the spare time.
('88', 375, 4, 26, 568689) But I too have looked after the management, haven’t I?
('88', 375, 4, 27, 568744) For me management itself had become a [training] class.
('88', 375, 4, 28, 568800) I was a teacher as well as a pupil.
('88', 375, 4, 29, 568836) The manager keeps an eye on everyone and sees how he sits, how he eats and what he

('88', 376, 1, 2, 569081) If within this framework, you can have a class, it will be all right.
('88', 376, 1, 3, 569151) For instance, at Kocharab, all education was given in the Ashram.
('88', 376, 1, 4, 569217) I had made a list of all those who were qualified to teach.
('88', 376, 1, 5, 569277) Probably only one or two hours were reserved for teaching.
('88', 376, 1, 6, 569336) I had assigned some work to myself too and I used to do my share.
('88', 376, 1, 7, 569402) 8. Workers have got to learn all the processes concerning cotton.
('88', 376, 1, 8, 569468) Let this instruction be imparted at Khadi Vidyalaya.
('88', 376, 1, 9, 569521) The three R’s must be taught.
('88', 376, 1, 10, 569551) I shall not be able to go into the details of how it is to be done.
('88', 376, 1, 11, 569619) 9. Even if Vinoba takes selections from Al Fateha 1 and Mazda 2
('88', 376, 2, 12, 569683) it will have to be in Arabic and Pehlavi.
('88', 376, 2, 13, 569725) They can be accompanied by Vinoba’s translation to bring out the meaning.
('88', 376, 2, 14, 569799) In my view there is some value in reciting them in the original.
('88', 376, 2, 15, 569864) I do not take the position that everything should be in the mother tongue or the national language.
('88', 376, 2, 16, 569964) 10. You are right.
('88', 376, 2, 17, 569983) 11. What you say is correct.
('88', 376, 2, 18, 570012) I am used to one room only and I have not had two separate rooms.
('88', 376, 2, 19, 570078) It is the same thought with a slight difference at the Christ Seva Sangh.
('88', 376, 2, 20, 570152) 12. I have written at length about clothing.
('88', 376, 2, 21, 570197) Go through it.
('88', 376, 2, 22, 570212) 13. Now I myself take spices.
('88', 376, 2, 23, 570242) But I hope I do that only by way of medicine.
('88', 376, 2, 24, 570288) I take them at the instance of Dr. Mehta but I am not even aware of their existence in my food.
('88', 376, 2, 25, 570384) The significant change is that we have now realized they have as much place in medicine as they have in taste.
('88', 376, 2, 26, 570495) Wheat is cooked in so many different ways for taste and we also make roti out of it to fill the stomach.
('88', 376, 2, 27, 570600) 14. The quantity of milk is all right.
('88', 376, 2, 28, 570639) Maybe, even one lb.
('88', 376, 2, 29, 570659) is enough.
('88', 376, 2, 30, 570670) 15. Gajraj has started going to the Talimi Sangh.
('88', 376, 2, 31, 570720) I think we should keep him there full time.
('88', 376, 2, 32, 570764) 16. Think things over and write to me further if you wish.
('88', 376, 2, 33, 570823) There are two sides to it.
('88', 376, 2, 34, 570850) 17. Write to Purushottam Gandhi 3 in this regard.
('88', 376, 2, 35, 570900) 18. Consider in this matter the person concerned and the

('88', 378, 3, 5, 572237) I am sorry and surprised that you have again misinterpreted my letter.
('88', 378, 3, 6, 572308) I had not suggested that because the correspondence between us was still going on you should not have your letter published.
('88', 378, 3, 7, 572433) I had only expressed my view that this correspondence should not be released to the press.
('88', 378, 3, 8, 572524) However, if you think it proper, you may have it published.
('88', 378, 3, 9, 572584) You are right in saying that Dastagir 2 can come here if he so desires.
('88', 378, 3, 10, 572656) I had not said I would comment on each separate clause of the constitution you have drafted.
('88', 378, 3, 11, 572749) I had only said that if broad questions are prepared in regard to it, I could try to reply to them.
('88', 378, 3, 12, 572849) But from your letter I have begun to fear that you may misunderstand anything I may say.
('88', 378, 3, 13, 572938) Be that as it may, if you formulate a few questions for me, I shall give you written replies to them.
('88', 378, 3, 14, 573040) It is unnecessary for Dastagir to come just to collect my replies.
('88', 378, 3, 15, 573107) Besides there is not even enough time for that.
('88', 378, 3, 16, 573155) But whatever you send at this address will reach me wherever I may be.
('88', 378, 3, 17, 573226) I have got one more complaint, namely, why do you write to me in English?

('88', 379, 1, 2, 573573) 700. WHY THE INSISTENCE ON THE YARN CLAUSE 1
('88', 379, 2, 3, 573618) November 27/28, 1945 This is an old argument.
('88', 379, 2, 4, 573664) 2 One wants to do many good things but is too lazy.
('88', 379, 2, 5, 573716) However, when a rule is made the work becomes easy.
('88', 379, 2, 6, 573768) Then one finds that one has gained the strength to do the work one could not do before.
('88', 379, 2, 7, 573856) By making the yarn clause compulsory, we do not coerce people.
('88', 379, 2, 8, 573919) We only make it easy for those who want to spin.
('88', 379, 2, 9, 573968) How long can they spin who have no heart in it?
('88', 379, 2, 10, 574016) It will be hypocritical if they spin as a demonstration.
('88', 379, 2, 11, 574073) Hyprocrites only do harm to themselves.
('88', 379, 2, 12, 574113) They cannot harm khadi in any way.
('88', 379, 2, 13, 574148) I would in fact go so far as to say that he who takes up spinning out of a desire for praise will gradually develop an interest in the activity and then continue to spin willingly.
('88', 379, 2, 14, 574329) If even after long practice he cannot find interest in spinning, if he still finds it a tedium he will give up khadi.
('88', 379, 2, 15, 574447) That will not harm us in any way.
('88', 379, 2, 16, 574481) If the khadi bhandars close down because of the yarn clause they well may.
('88', 379, 2, 17, 574556) And I do not care whether anyone buys khadi or not.
('88', 379, 2, 18, 574608) I do not wish to run a shop.
('88', 379, 2, 19, 574637) I want people to learn spinning.
('88', 379, 2, 20, 574670) In Bombay 300 or 350 charkhas are plied.
('88', 379, 2, 21, 574711) But this number means nothing.
('88', 379, 2, 22, 574742) What I want is that there should be as many charkhas plying there as there are homes.
('88', 379, 2, 23, 574828) If the cities are to imbibe non violence there is no other way.
('88', 379, 2, 24, 574892) The Government have the force that destroys; I have the charkha.
('88', 379, 2, 25, 574957) The charkha alone can save us from destructive force.
('88', 379, 2, 26, 575011) All other methods are useless.
('88', 379, 2, 27, 575042) If the enforcement of the yarn clause results in reduced sales of khadi and if the consequent loss forces us to close down the khadi bhandars, we may close them down.
('88', 379, 2, 28, 575209) We cannot maintain khadi bhandars to sell khadi.
('88', 379, 2, 29, 575258) You will say that if khadi bhandars in the city close down we shall have to sell khadi in the villages and that khadi cannot sell in the villages as it can in the cities.
('88', 379, 2, 30, 575429) I agree that khadi cannot sell in the villages and it should not.
('88', 379, 2, 31, 575495) Khadi is not to be sold in the villages, it is to be worn there.
('88', 379, 2, 32, 575560) It is to be spun and worn.
('88', 379, 2, 33, 575587) Rather than that we should have to get licences from the Government for khadi bhandars it is better that khadi dies, it is better that the khadi
('88', 379, 3, 34, 575732) 1 According to the source this is a summary of what Gandhiji had said at discussions with the Charkha Sangh workers on November 27 and 28.
('88', 379, 4, 35, 575871) 2 It had been suggested that those who could not tender yarn for the purchase of khadi should be allowed to buy it for cash, and that making the tendering of yarn compulsory would amount to coercion.
('88', 380, 0, 1, 576071) VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 6 DECEMBER, 1945 381
('88', 380, 1, 2, 576117) shops close down.
('88', 380, 1, 3, 576135) Khadi cannot survive if it has to depend on others for its survival.
('88', 380, 1, 4, 576204) Then it will be its lot to disappear.
('88', 380, 1, 5, 576242) Once you understand the idea behind khadi you will not be nervous.
('88', 380, 1, 6, 576309) You will not wonder how khadi bhandars and khadi centres will carry on.
('88', 380, 1, 7, 576381) Since we have taken that step, since we have dared, we must be prepared to face difficulties.
('88', 380, 1, 8, 576475) If we have to suffer set backs we must be prepared for it.
('88', 380, 1, 9, 576534) You ask about woollens and silks.
('88', 380, 1, 10, 576568) Who wears them?
('88', 380, 1, 11, 576584) Can the poor do so?
('88', 380, 1, 12, 576604) Why should we take all the trouble for a few rich people?
('88', 380, 1, 13, 576662) These things cannot become universal.
('88', 380, 1, 14, 576700) We may certainly keep stocks of woollens and silks in khadi bhandars as we keep other things there but we must understand that that is no part of our work.
('88', 380, 1, 15, 576856) We may not apply the yarn clause to woollens and silks.
('88', 380, 1, 16, 576912) We may not ask for yarn when selling these.
('88', 380, 1, 17, 576956) Do we ask for yarn when selling other village handicrafts?
('88', 380, 1, 18, 577015) Woollens and silks come in that category.
('88', 380, 1, 19, 577057) If we remain steadfast, the importance of khadi will not diminish.
('88', 380, 1, 20, 577124) If we think of meeting the expenditure of khadi bhandars out of the proceeds from the sale of woollens and silks, it will not help khadi, it will only harm it.
('88', 380, 1, 21, 577284) If we carry on the khadi activity with the help of woollens and silks we shall become crippled.
('88', 380, 1, 22, 577380) We shall not be able to carry on with the khadi work.
('88', 380, 1, 23, 577434) Khadi work can sustain itself.
('88', 380, 1, 24, 577465) It does not require dependence on anyone.
('88', 380, 1, 25, 577507) No one can kill khadi.
('88', 380, 1, 26, 577530) How can mills do so?
('88', 380, 1, 27, 577551) Mills may themselves be destroyed.
('88', 380, 1, 28, 577586) We do not worry on that account.
('88', 380, 1, 29, 577619) All the activities concerned with khadi, right from the picking of cotton to the weaving of khadi, should be carried on by the khadi bhandars.
('88', 380, 1, 30, 577762) Selling of khadi is only a minor activity.
('88', 380, 1, 31, 577805) Kakubhai is the secretary of the Bombay khadi bhandar.
('88', 380, 1, 32, 577860) I want to see how skilled he is.
('88', 380, 1, 33, 577893) I want to see in his hand not a pen but a charkha.
('88', 380, 1, 34, 577944) He should be an expert in all the processes employed in khadi.
('88', 380, 1, 35, 578007) If I were in a bhandar I would spin, I would card.
('88', 380, 1, 36, 578058) We have to teach people spinning and weaving through the bhandars.
('88', 380, 1, 37, 578125) Today we do try to teach people how to ply the charkha.
('88', 380, 1, 38, 578181) But if khadi is to reach every home we must teach people ginning, carding and all the other processes.
('88', 380, 1, 39, 578284) I do not much care for buying slivers.
('88', 380, 1, 40, 578323) One should make slivers oneself.
('88', 380, 1, 41, 578356) Today machine made slivers are used.
('88', 380, 1, 42, 578393) The practice must stop.
('88', 380, 1, 43, 578417) Everyone should card his own cotton, make his own slivers and then spin.
('88', 380, 1, 44, 578490) Only then can we say that we have adopted khadi.
('88', 380, 1, 45, 578539) I have become a lover of hand carding.
('88', 380, 1, 46, 578578) Even inferior cotton such as mathia, hand carded, can yield yarn of the fineness of 20 counts.
('88', 380, 1, 47, 578673) The mills cannot produce yarn of a count higher than six or seven from this cotton.
('88', 380, 1, 48, 578757) I prefer hand carding to carding with a bow.
('88', 380, 1, 49, 578802) It does not expose one to the risk either of consumption or asthma.
('88', 380, 1, 50, 578870) Even a queen in her palace can easily take
('88', 381, 0, 1, 578913) 382 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('88', 381, 1, 2, 578955) this up.
('88', 381, 1, 3, 578964) Even children and old men can card and make slivers.
('88', 381, 1, 4, 579017) It is a simple and easy activity.
('88', 381, 1, 5, 579051) Today we must not think of spreading khadi by carrying it about on our backs and hawking it.
('88', 381, 1, 6, 579144) We have not to give anyone ready made khadi.
('88', 381, 1, 7, 579189) We shall say, ‘take this charkha, take this cotton, card it, make slivers and spin.
('88', 381, 1, 8, 579273) Get the weaver in your village to weave it and then wear it.’ I would in fact say that the khadi bhandars not only should not have khadi, they should not even have slivers and cotton.
('88', 381, 1, 9, 579457) If people demand them we may give them cotton and the necessary tools and arrange for spinning to be taught.
('88', 381, 1, 10, 579566) You will then see that the country will have no dearth of khadi or cloth as such.
('88', 381, 1, 11, 579648) Cloth is frequently rationed and still cloth famine persists.
('88', 381, 1, 12, 579710) I can remove it.
('88', 381, 1, 13, 579727) If I was made responsible for it, I could provide cloth to everyone.
('88', 381, 1, 14, 579796) I am going to Bengal.
('88', 381, 1, 15, 579818) If they do as I desire, I shall see that there will be no cloth famine there.
('88', 381, 1, 16, 579896) You ask if you should provide khadi for hospitals.
('88', 381, 1, 17, 579947) For where will the patients find yarn, how will they be able to spin?
('88', 381, 1, 18, 580017) Similarly there are the Congress committees, the district boards, the banks.
('88', 381, 1, 19, 580094) Then there are exhibitions, Congress meetings and so on, which require khadi worth thousands of rupees.
('88', 381, 1, 20, 580198) Where can they all find the yarn?
('88', 381, 1, 21, 580232) Would it not be right to give them khadi without insisting on yarn being tendered?
('88', 381, 1, 22, 580315) I say that if these institutions cannot tender yarn they should give up the idea of khadi.
('88', 381, 1, 23, 580406) They can borrow the yarn, they can make their members spin or they can obtain it from friends.
('88', 381, 1, 24, 580501) I want to allow no exceptions to the rule.
('88', 381, 1, 25, 580544) I have taken in hand the nature cure clinic of Dinshaw Mehta at Poona.
('88', 381, 1, 26, 580615) Do you think I can use mill cloth there?
('88', 381, 1, 27, 580656) I said to Dinshaw, ‘I shall give you my yarn and you can buy khadi in exchange.’ Everyone will have to give yarn, be he a raja or a maharaja.
('88', 381, 1, 28, 580798) The yarn clause allows for buying yarn from the neighbours, but this is against my intention.
('88', 381, 1, 29, 580892) I do not want this.
('88', 381, 1, 30, 580912) What I have said is that people may take yarn from their neighbour but they may not pay for it.
('88', 381, 1, 31, 581008) We do not take things from our friends by paying for them.
('88', 381, 1, 32, 581067) That would be commerce.
('88', 381, 1, 33, 581091) If we do not have something we take it from the neighbours and later when we get it ourselves, we return it.
('88', 381, 1, 34, 581200) As a good neighbour he may not take it back but in any case no payment is involved.
('88', 381, 1, 35, 581284) There is in the resolution also the provision for one’s servant doing the spinning.
('88', 381, 1, 36, 581368) It is the same as the members of one’s family spinning and one tendering the yarn in one’s name.
('88', 381, 1, 37, 581465) But it would not be right if someone were to employ a servant specifically for spinning because that is the same as buying the yarn.
('88', 381, 1, 38, 581598) If a servant employed for
('88', 382, 0, 1, 581624) VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 6 DECEMBER, 1945 383
('88', 382, 1, 2, 581670) household work spends a little time on spinning for his employer we can have no objection.
('88', 382, 1, 3, 581761) At the Times of India office, Bombay, they wanted some khadi.
('88', 382, 1, 4, 581823) They came to me and asked, ‘Where shall we find the yarn?’ I said, ‘You have so many peons and workers in your office who do nothing but paste addresses.
('88', 382, 1, 5, 581977) Allow them an hour or two every day for spinning.
('88', 382, 1, 6, 582027) Teach them the art.
('88', 382, 1, 7, 582047) And use the yarn so produced to buy khadi.’ I suggested spinning clubs being organized in cities.
('88', 382, 1, 8, 582145) But I see a different meaning has been put upon what I had said.
('88', 382, 1, 9, 582210) The Club at Bombay became an agency for the sale of yarn.
('88', 382, 1, 10, 582268) Workers are employed who spin for wages and then people buy the yarn to procure their khadi from the bhandars.
('88', 382, 1, 11, 582379) This is to murder truth.
('88', 382, 1, 12, 582404) What I had said was that since large cities are too cramped and people have to live in very small rooms where there is no space for spinning or keeping the charkha or carding, clubs should be organized in various localities and in the precincts of khadi bhandars where people could go to card, make slivers and spin.
('88', 382, 1, 13, 582721) This could remedy the lack of space for spinning.
('88', 382, 1, 14, 582771) Also it would be easier to arrange for instruction in spinning.
('88', 382, 1, 15, 582835) But the clubs that have been started are of a totally different kind and they should be discontinued.
('88', 382, 1, 16, 582937) We should not leave hold of truth.
('88', 382, 1, 17, 582972) We must not deceive ourselves.
('88', 382, 1, 18, 583003) We must give up the lure of selling khadi.
('88', 382, 1, 19, 583046) We should now develop an interest in teaching khadi.
('88', 382, 1, 20, 583099) If this results in the sale of khadi stopping we should not mind it.
('88', 382, 1, 21, 583168) But the khadi of my conception can only prosper by this means.
('88', 382, 1, 22, 583231) You ask what should be the character of the Bombay khadi bhandar now.
('88', 382, 1, 23, 583301) I myself am anxious to make my idea clear.
('88', 382, 1, 24, 583344) In the first place we must shift the bhandar from a central market like Kalabadevi.
('88', 382, 1, 25, 583428) We should take it to a suburb such as Dadar or Vile [Parle], where we can find enough space.
('88', 382, 1, 26, 583521) The work of the bhandar also should undergo change.
('88', 382, 1, 27, 583573) The manager will not try and persuade people to buy khadi.
('88', 382, 1, 28, 583632) He will sit in the bhandar and spin on the takli.
('88', 382, 1, 29, 583682) His co workers will do the same.
('88', 382, 1, 30, 583715) He will talk to the customers and try to explain to them the new khadi policy.
('88', 382, 1, 31, 583794) If someone is willing to learn spinning he will teach him.
('88', 382, 1, 32, 583853) He will not use ready made slivers.
('88', 382, 1, 33, 583889) He will teach all the processes.
('88', 382, 1, 34, 583922) beginning with hand carding.
('88', 382, 1, 35, 583951) He will also gather at the bhandar some artisans.
('88', 382, 1, 36, 584001) He will have looms operated where the yarn spun can be woven.
('88', 382, 1, 37, 584063) He will have charkhas and other implements manufactured.
('88', 382, 1, 38, 584120) He will repair the implements of the customers.
('88', 382, 1, 39, 584168) The surroundings of the bhandar will be clean and the air
('88', 383, 0, 1, 584226) 384 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('88', 383, 1, 2, 584268) will be pure.
('88', 383, 1, 3, 584282) There will be cleanliness.
('88', 383, 1, 4, 584309) The charkhas will be in proper order and the atmosphere will be congenial for spinning.
('88', 383, 1, 5, 584397) It will also have facilities for selling khadi.
('88', 383, 1, 6, 584445) The Bombay bhandar up to now has been a clearing house.
('88', 383, 1, 7, 584501) It will still be that though in a different way.
('88', 383, 1, 8, 584550) So long we only worried about what the Bombay customers wanted.
('88', 383, 1, 9, 584614) If a handkerchief of a particular design was in vogue we told the production centres to make such handkerchiefs.
('88', 383, 1, 10, 584727) If it was a sari with a particular border we told the Andhra people to make such saris.
('88', 383, 1, 11, 584815) We even used to send representatives of the bhandars to those far away places to explain what exactly was wanted.
('88', 383, 1, 12, 584929) We took up printing saris at Masulipatnam.
('88', 383, 1, 13, 584972) It revived a dying craft.
('88', 383, 1, 14, 584998) But if we do not now change our method of work the same thing will be the undoing of khadi.
('88', 383, 1, 15, 585090) Now the centres will have to meet the needs of the areas around them.
('88', 383, 1, 16, 585160) They have to produce things with that end in view.
('88', 383, 1, 17, 585211) In the matter of designs they do not have to follow the directives of the Bombay bhandar.
('88', 383, 1, 18, 585301) Bombay will have to accept whatever varieties and designs are left and be content with that.
('88', 383, 1, 19, 585394) It is no part of our duty to provide to the cities the designs they want.
('88', 383, 1, 20, 585468) Our duty is only to teach how people can produce things that they want.
('88', 383, 1, 21, 585540) That is the reason why I want the bhandars to be shifted from a central bazaar.
('88', 383, 1, 22, 585620) Take some place on the outskirts of the city which is attractive.
('88', 383, 1, 23, 585686) Create beauty in wilderness.
('88', 383, 1, 24, 585715) It is said that the English once had their factory on the banks of the Tapti on the outskirts of Surat, from where they started running the country.
('88', 383, 1, 25, 585864) They wanted to suppress the khadi and other village industries of India.
('88', 383, 1, 26, 585937) Our mission will be to revive them.
('88', 383, 1, 27, 585973) If some stray artisan happens to come to you, put him at a loom.
('88', 383, 1, 28, 586038) Start the work of carding, spinning and such other activities.
('88', 383, 1, 29, 586101) Let a model village grow up there.
('88', 383, 1, 30, 586136) Make the khadi bhandar an attractive centre.
('88', 383, 1, 31, 586181) Those who seek peace from the noise of Bombay will go there on Saturdays if not every day.
('88', 383, 1, 32, 586272) They will buy their khadi and learn carding.
('88', 383, 1, 33, 586317) If you make things you need in the village way the city folk may also find an interest in such activity.
('88', 383, 1, 34, 586422) If you talk about our responsibility to the people of Bombay I shall ask: ‘What responsibility?’ If the people of Bombay continue their old interest, what shall we do?
('88', 383, 1, 35, 586590) Will you be able to interest yourselves in horse racing, gambling, cinema, theatre, dancing?
('88', 383, 1, 36, 586683) What can you do about people who want to pursue these?
('88', 383, 1, 37, 586738) Yes, if they want the facility to live in the style of a village we may invite them.
('88', 383, 1, 38, 586823) That will be doing our duty.
('88', 383, 1, 39, 586852) You say that in a city like Bombay where people are politically conscious we can make khadi a success only if
('88', 384, 0, 1, 586962) VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 6 DECEMBER, 1945 385
('88', 384, 1, 2, 587008) we are able to persuade them that the success of our political work depends on our pursuing this new khadi policy.
('88', 384, 1, 3, 587123) I shall only answer that khadi has value to me only if it is a symbol of ahimsa.
('88', 384, 1, 4, 587204) An American once said that it was not words that grew but it was the work.
('88', 384, 1, 5, 587279) Your success will depend on what kind of khadi bhandars and what kind of surroundings for them you can create with your faith and tapascharya.

('88', 384, 3, 8, 587510) November 28, 1945 Whatever work regarding education is carried on under the Kasturba Nidhi, whether it is for children or adults, should be given only through manual labour and handicrafts.
('88', 384, 3, 9, 587700) Trained teachers will be required to carry on this work properly.
('88', 384, 3, 10, 587766) Arrangements should be made to give training to these teachers in registered training schools.
('88', 384, 3, 11, 587861) So long as such teachers are not ready, education can be imparted through manual labour and handicrafts but instruction in handicrafts should also be given in a proper way.
('88', 384, 3, 12, 588034) The teachers should study the literature of Nayee Talim and carry on their work on those lines as far as possible till they get properly trained.

('88', 384, 7, 17, 588360) VANUDI, I got your letter.
('88', 384, 7, 18, 588387) I have no doubt about your purity, nor about your firmness of mind.
('88', 384, 7, 19, 588455) But if you yourself have some doubt, however faint, regarding the propriety of what you do, you should carefully think over it and change your habits suitably.
('88', 384, 7, 20, 588615) Suppose, for instance, you tell somebody in jest that you are married and have a few children, and add that your mother in law is dead.
('88', 384, 7, 21, 588751) Such jokes are
('88', 385, 0, 1, 588766) 386 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('88', 385, 1, 2, 588808) permissible, but the dangers in them are easy to see.
('88', 385, 1, 3, 588862) That is why even in the highest circles we still hear criticism of certain things that take place in theatres.
('88', 385, 1, 4, 588973) If a married man acts the part of Rama in a play and a woman married to another man that of Sita, how far is that desirable for both?
('88', 385, 1, 5, 589107) It also requires to be seriously considered what kind of effect such Rama and Sita produce on the spectators.
('88', 385, 1, 6, 589217) That carried away by the modern trend we may do or like improper things or see others doing that is altogether a different matter.
('88', 385, 1, 7, 589348) I do not wish to dwell at length on this, nor have I the time for that.
('88', 385, 1, 8, 589420) But you are a thoughtful girl and I have, therefore, put before you in a few words an important question for you to think over.
('88', 385, 1, 9, 589548) I hope you keep good health, and trust that all of you devote yourselves to keeping the Arogya Bhavan clean in every possible manner.
('88', 385, 1, 10, 589682) You have with you many visitors now.
('88', 385, 1, 11, 589719) Use the services of them all in cleaning up the place.
('88', 385, 1, 12, 589774) I am trying to send Munnalal there.
('88', 385, 1, 13, 589810) I expect he will arrive there in about a week.

('88', 385, 7, 19, 590091) Though you have become the mother of so many children, you are still as foolish as ever.
('88', 385, 7, 20, 590180) If I cannot write to you owing to pressure of work and ask somebody else to do so, what is wrong in that?
('88', 385, 7, 21, 590286) You did a good thing in giving me all the news of the family.
('88', 385, 7, 22, 590348) Do come when I settle down again in the Ashram and stay there as long as you wish.
('88', 385, 7, 23, 590431) Bring your son with you.
('88', 385, 7, 24, 590456) Perhaps you do not know that in Poona Valji 1 used to come every day to read books to me.
('88', 385, 7, 25, 590546) I would quietly spin while he read to me for half an hour or three quarters of an hour.

('88', 386, 5, 7, 591032) SEVAGRAM, November 28, 1945
('88', 386, 6, 8, 591060) KANTI, I got your postcard, as also the report sent by you.
('88', 386, 6, 9, 591120) The latter seems to have been drafted by you.
('88', 386, 6, 10, 591166) If so, your English is weak.
('88', 386, 6, 11, 591195) Ordinarily this should not count as a deficiency in one, but in India it is; for we take pride, though we ought not to, in being able to speak and write a foreign language correctly.
('88', 386, 6, 12, 591378) I am a lover of all languages and take scrupulous care to write correctly, but I am more eager to convey my meaning and am not scared of making mistakes.
('88', 386, 6, 13, 591532) Were it not so, I would never have been able to speak in Hindi and other languages.
('88', 386, 6, 14, 591616) Having said this, my criticism of the report is that its English is not correct.
('88', 386, 6, 15, 591697) I have no time to revise it and return it.
('88', 386, 6, 16, 591740) The report itself is good and, therefore, I show it to everybody who is interested in it.
('88', 386, 6, 17, 591830) I am now sending it to Jajuji to read.
('88', 386, 6, 18, 591869) I shall not feel sorry that you will be breaking up an organization which you have brought into being.
('88', 386, 6, 19, 591972) Your leaving it will amount to breaking it.
('88', 386, 6, 20, 592016) I only hope that your action will not be an expression of the rashness and anger which I have observed in your nature.
('88', 386, 6, 21, 592135) Sometimes it becomes one’s dharma to humbly cling to the organization one has set up, despite the co workers’ coolness towards oneself.
('88', 386, 6, 22, 592271) I have been doing this from a much earlier age than you are at present and it has certainly benefited me.
('88', 386, 6, 23, 592377) Endurance is a virtue worth cultivating.
('88', 386, 6, 24, 592418) You are a student of the Gita.
('88', 386, 6, 25, 592449) Ponder the profound truths contained in it.
('88', 386, 6, 26, 592493) After cautioning you thus, I unreservedly accept your decision.
('88', 386, 6, 27, 592557) If you teach the students who come to you and take

('88', 387, 1, 3, 592761) In future lay stress from the very beginning on all the processes relating to cotton.
('88', 387, 1, 4, 592847) I have come to realize from daily experience that this is of the utmost importance.
('88', 387, 1, 5, 592931) My good wishes for the result of your examination.

('88', 387, 6, 16, 593370) I do wish to offer you some suggestions but that will be when I can spare the time.
('88', 387, 6, 17, 593454) For the present I shall say only this much.
('88', 387, 6, 18, 593498) Give full encouragement to those who are engaged in the cleaning activity.
('88', 387, 6, 19, 593573) You must also pay as much attention to it as you can while doing your own work.
('88', 387, 6, 20, 593653) You will have already decided to dispose of all the furniture.
('88', 387, 6, 21, 593716) You can take it to Bombay and sell it there to recover the price or if you want me to dispose of it you will let me know, so that I may make arrangements from wherever I am.
('88', 387, 6, 22, 593890) We shall not sell it at a throw away price.
('88', 387, 6, 23, 593934) Bhai Munnalal will be going there in six or seven days.
('88', 387, 6, 24, 593990) He will take part in the cleaning activity.
('88', 387, 6, 25, 594034) I think he can keep the accounts and do for you whatever shopping there is to be done.
('88', 387, 6, 26, 594121) He is well versed in all the three things and has done them all before.
('88', 387, 6, 27, 594193) I understand that Mr. Mange is looking after the accounts and shopping.
('88', 387, 6, 28, 594265) I wish to keep him entirely out of all this.
('88', 387, 6, 29, 594310) I have no doubt that he should train himself for something else.
('88', 387, 6, 30, 594375) He should become a naturopath.
('88', 387, 6, 31, 594406) He should also educate himself.

('88', 388, 5, 11, 594996) I think there is some misunderstanding.
('88', 388, 5, 12, 595036) You had better ask Jawaharlal also and write to me at Calcutta.

('88', 388, 7, 17, 595280) Q. The object of the constructive programme is stated to be the preparation of the people for a non violent political order.
('88', 388, 7, 18, 595405) Is this definition correct?
('88', 388, 7, 19, 595433) Or will it be better to define such a social and political order as one in which no one would be able to exploit the labour of another?
('88', 388, 8, 20, 595569) A. Your definition is correct but it is incomplete.
('88', 388, 8, 21, 595621) In what way it is incomplete will be explained in the answer to your next question.
('88', 388, 9, 22, 595705) Q. If my definition is correct I feel such a social and political order can be achieved theoretically even by our making the largest use of machinery.
('88', 388, 9, 23, 595856) In that case is it necessary to have the maximum number of village industries for the non violent political order?
('88', 388, 9, 24, 595971) If so why?
('88', 388, 10, 25, 595982) A. Non violence cannot be divided into compartments.
('88', 388, 10, 26, 596035) Non violence is an inherent attribute of man or, at any rate, it should be an attribute of man during his waking hours.
('88', 388, 10, 27, 596155) Devotion to non violence is the highest expression of his conscious state.
('88', 388, 10, 28, 596230) If we thus conceive ahimsa we should satisfy all our necessities by the labour of our
('88', 388, 11, 29, 596316) 1 Nature Cure Clinic at Uruli Kanchan
('88', 389, 0, 1, 596354) 390 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('88', 389, 1, 2, 596396) If we do not do this we shall have to depend upon other powers and as long as such condition persists we shall be unable to realize a state of fearless ness.
('88', 389, 1, 3, 596554) Another danger in making more and more use of machinery is that we have to make great efforts for the protection of it, that is to say, we shall have to keep an army as is being done today elsewhere in the world.
('88', 389, 1, 4, 596767) The fact is that even if there is no danger of aggression from outside we shall be slaves to those who will be in control of the big machinery.
('88', 389, 1, 5, 596911) Take the case of the atom bomb.
('88', 389, 1, 6, 596943) Those nations who have atom bombs are feared even by their friends.
('88', 389, 1, 7, 597011) If we take a wise view, we shall be saved from the working of machinery.
('88', 389, 2, 8, 597084) Q. One of the reasons given in favour of hand spinning is that it makes one self sufficient.
('88', 389, 2, 9, 597177) Can one who is self sufficient serve society better than one who is dependent on others?
('88', 389, 2, 10, 597266) Do you mean to say that there is such a connection between self sufficiency and social service that the more one is self sufficient the more is one’s capacity for social service?
('88', 389, 2, 11, 597445) A. In order to satisfy this doubt also we will have to keep in mind the non violent outlook because truth and non violence form the foundation of the order of my conception.
('88', 389, 2, 12, 597619) Our first duty is that we should not be a burden on society, i.e., we should be self sufficient.
('88', 389, 2, 13, 597716) That means self sufficiency by itself is a kind of service.
('88', 389, 2, 14, 597776) After becoming self sufficient we shall use our spare time for the service of others.
('88', 389, 2, 15, 597862) If all become self sufficient no one will have any difficulty.
('88', 389, 2, 16, 597925) In that case no one will be required to undertake service of others.
('88', 389, 2, 17, 597994) But we have not yet reached that stage and therefore we have to think of social service.
('88', 389, 2, 18, 598083) Even if we succeed in realizing complete self sufficiency, man being a social animal we shall have to accept service in some form or other.
('88', 389, 2, 19, 598223) That is, man is as much dependent on others as he is dependent on himself.
('88', 389, 2, 20, 598298) When dependence becomes necessary in order to keep society in good order it is no longer dependence but becomes co operation.
('88', 389, 2, 21, 598424) There is a fragrance in co operation and there is no one weak or strong among the co operators.
('88', 389, 2, 22, 598520) Everyone is equal.
('88', 389, 2, 23, 598539) There is a feeling of helplessness in dependency.
('88', 389, 2, 24, 598589) Members of a family are as much self dependent as interdependent, but there is no feeling of mine or thine.
('88', 389, 2, 25, 598697) That is why they are called co operators.
('88', 389, 2, 26, 598739) Similarly when we take a society, a nation or the entire mankind as a family all men become co operators.
('88', 389, 2, 27, 598845) If we can conceive a picture of such co operation we shall find that there is no need of depending upon lifeless machines.
('88', 389, 2, 28, 598968) Or we shall have to use them the least, not the most, and therein lies the real security and self protection of society.
('88', 390, 0, 1, 599089) VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 6 DECEMBER, 1945 391
('88', 390, 1, 2, 599135) Q. You lay more emphasis on spinning than on agriculture.
('88', 390, 1, 3, 599193) Is there any political reason behind it?
('88', 390, 1, 4, 599234) Or is it because people cannot take to farming as easily as they can to spinning?
('88', 390, 1, 5, 599316) A. I do not make such divisions as social, economic and political.
('88', 390, 1, 6, 599383) What is political is also social and economic.
('88', 390, 1, 7, 599430) One includes the others.
('88', 390, 1, 8, 599455) It is true that we make and have to make such divisions for clarity of understanding.
('88', 390, 1, 9, 599541) One of the reasons why I have not laid stress on agriculture is that even my knowledge of it is almost nil.
('88', 390, 1, 10, 599649) How will I be able to enlighten you if I put emphasis on it?
('88', 390, 1, 11, 599710) It is not so in the case of the charkha.
('88', 390, 1, 12, 599751) I have acquired enough knowledge of it.
('88', 390, 1, 13, 599791) Secondly under foreign rule the charkha had died out; it had been destroyed.
('88', 390, 1, 14, 599868) Agriculture can never be destroyed but its form has been so changed that it has increased the slavery of the people.
('88', 390, 1, 15, 599985) The third reason for putting emphasis on the charkha is that skill of hand has a very small place in agriculture.
('88', 390, 1, 16, 600099) There is hardly any other industry in which the hands and the fingers are so much used as they are in the various processes that go to make khadi.
('88', 390, 1, 17, 600246) The fourth reason is that foreign power first takes hold of the land and through it controls the other things.
('88', 390, 1, 18, 600357) Therefore Government help is very necessary for improvement in agriculture.
('88', 390, 1, 19, 600433) For these and other similar reasons I have laid more emphasis on hand spinning.
('88', 390, 2, 20, 600513) Q. One of the features of the material development of human society appears to be that man is tending to move more and more from self sufficiency to dependency.
('88', 390, 2, 21, 600674) Don’t you think this tendency is not right and that there will be revival of the opposite tendency?
('88', 390, 2, 22, 600774) A. I take this question to mean that society is advancing towards machinery.
('88', 390, 2, 23, 600851) If I have understood the question right, my answer is that society must get rid of its slavery to the machine.
('88', 390, 2, 24, 600962) By being slaves to the machine our slavery to our senses and their activity also increases immensely.
('88', 390, 3, 25, 601064) Q. Are you confident that the constructive programme will be able to achieve its object during your lifetime by mere propaganda?
('88', 390, 3, 26, 601193) Don’t you think taking into consideration human frailties (lust, anger, greed, infatuation, pride and jealousy) that there will be need for “legislative aid” 1 to make the people take to the constructive programme on any wide scale especially in this machine age?
('88', 390, 3, 27, 601457) Will there be any violation of the principle of non violence in taking such help from the elected representatives of the people?
('88', 390, 3, 28, 601586) If so how?
('88', 390, 4, 29, 601597) A. I have said many a time that we will have to take help from the Government on our own terms.
('88', 390, 4, 30, 601693) Not only that, we will have to take help from the whole world There was a time when I felt that we could have only the barest minimum of help from the legislators in the matter of constructive programme.
('88', 390, 4, 31, 601897) But now I have come to realize
('88', 391, 0, 1, 601928) 392 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('88', 391, 1, 2, 601970) that if the representatives of the people go into the legislatures we can secure their help.
('88', 391, 1, 3, 602063) Along with this we must bear in mind that we cannot appreciate the value of the constructive programme properly if we cannot carry it on in adverse circumstances.
('88', 391, 1, 4, 602226) Other people of course can’t.
('88', 391, 1, 5, 602256) I can say dispassionately but from experience that the strength of the people has increased in proportion to the progress of the constructive programme.
('88', 391, 1, 6, 602409) If we can make the constructive programme universal and get it implemented through the people, then swaraj is in our hands.

('88', 391, 4, 10, 602666) MY DEAR HOYLAND 1, It gladdened me to see your letter after such a long time and made me happy to find that Prof.
('88', 391, 4, 11, 602780) Privat 2 and his wife 3 were with you.
('88', 391, 4, 12, 602819) Of course I remember the communion wehad at Woodbrooke, now as you remind me, fourteen years ago.
('88', 391, 4, 13, 602917) I suppose Woodbrooke has grown during this what may be called fairly long lapse of time, and I wonder how the ‘School for the Imbeciles’ we all visited 4 is faring.
('88', 391, 4, 14, 603082) My love to all.
('88', 391, 4, 15, 603098) I am looking forward to the visit of Horace and Agatha.

('88', 392, 8, 10, 604156) Arun is a good boy but he is not up to the mark.
('88', 392, 8, 11, 604205) He does not even know additions, though he talks of additions, subtractions, multiplications and divisions.
('88', 392, 8, 12, 604313) It was only when I tested him yesterday that I could understand the report given to me by Valji.
('88', 392, 8, 13, 604410) But it is not his fault.
('88', 392, 8, 14, 604435) It is the parents’ fault and now that of us all who are here.
('88', 392, 8, 15, 604497) I am the first among them.

('88', 392, 11, 19, 604598) 711. FOREWORD TO “GANDHIAN CONSTITUTION FOR FREE INDIA”
('88', 392, 12, 20, 604654) Perhaps the expression “Gandhian Constitution” is not a fitting title for Principal Agrawal’s 3 pages.
('88', 392, 12, 21, 604757) It may be acceptable as a convenient and compact title.
('88', 392, 12, 22, 604813) The framework is really Principal Agrawal’s, based on his study of my writings.
('88', 392, 12, 23, 604893) He has been interpreting them for a number of years.
('88', 392, 12, 24, 604946) And as he is anxious not to
('88', 392, 13, 25, 604974) 1 This was written at the back of Arun’s letter to his parents, i.

('88', 393, 0, 1, 605197) 394 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('88', 393, 1, 2, 605239) misinterpret them in any way he would publish nothing without my seeing it.
('88', 393, 1, 3, 605315) This is both an advantage and a disadvantage.
('88', 393, 1, 4, 605361) The advantage is obvious.
('88', 393, 1, 5, 605387) The disadvantage lies in the reader mistaking the particular writing being my view in every detail.
('88', 393, 1, 6, 605487) Let me then warn him against making any such mistake.
('88', 393, 1, 7, 605541) If I were to commit myself to every word appearing in these pages, I might as well write the thing myself.
('88', 393, 1, 8, 605648) Though I have endeavoured to read the constitution twice, with as much attention as I was able to bestow on it during my other engagements, I could not undertake to check every thought and every word of it.
('88', 393, 1, 9, 605855) Nor would my sense of propriety and individual freedom permit me to commit any such atrocity.
('88', 393, 1, 10, 605949) All, therefore, I am able to say is that the brochure contains ample evidence of the care bestowed upon it by the author to make it as accurate as he could.
('88', 393, 1, 11, 606106) There is nothing in it which has jarred on me as inconsistent with what I would like to stand for.
('88', 393, 1, 12, 606205) The author was good enough to make such alterations as I thought were necessary.
('88', 393, 1, 13, 606286) The word “constitution” must not mislead the reader into thinking that the author has made any profession to give him a complete constitution.
('88', 393, 1, 14, 606429) He has made it perfectly clear in the beginning pages that he has only laid down broad lines to indicate what a constitution of my conception would be.
('88', 393, 1, 15, 606581) I regard Principal Agrawal’s to be a thoughtful contribution to the many attempts at presenting India with constitutions.
('88', 393, 1, 16, 606703) The merit of his attempt consists in the fact that he has done what for want of time I have failed to do.

('88', 394, 2, 3, 607003) November 30, 1945
('88', 394, 3, 4, 607021) Yesterday I went to see the Talimi Sangh hostel.
('88', 394, 3, 5, 607070) You know Hoshiaribehn 1 who stays in the Ashram.
('88', 394, 3, 6, 607119) I have sent her son Gajraj to your school.
('88', 394, 3, 7, 607162) He insisted that I should see his school.
('88', 394, 3, 8, 607204) Even yesterday morning he came and said: “You will come, won’t you?” I said: “What shall I do at your school?
('88', 394, 3, 9, 607314) I would rather see the place where you sleep.” I had intended to send his mother too.
('88', 394, 3, 10, 607400) Anyway, I went there after my morning walk to keep my promise.
('88', 394, 3, 11, 607463) I was pained by what I saw there.
('88', 394, 3, 12, 607497) I noticed filth and mismanagement which should not have been there.
('88', 394, 3, 13, 607565) I had not wanted to spend much time there, but I could not bear what I saw there and spent half an hour or threequarters of an hour explaining things to Pandey.
('88', 394, 4, 14, 607726) I found there were puddles of water in front of the verandah of the children’s hospital.
('88', 394, 4, 15, 607815) It offended the eye.
('88', 394, 4, 16, 607836) The children wash themselves right there.
('88', 394, 4, 17, 607878) This breeds mosquitoes and so much of water is wasted.
('88', 394, 4, 18, 607933) We should collect the water in a tub.
('88', 394, 4, 19, 607971) Or we may wash beside the trees near by.
('88', 394, 4, 20, 608012) If there were a thousand boys it would be a disaster.
('88', 394, 4, 21, 608066) Going through the room I found the same thing in front of the verandah on the other side.
('88', 394, 5, 22, 608156) Then I went to the children’s dormitory.
('88', 394, 5, 23, 608197) Even at the entrance there was a lot of dirt.
('88', 394, 5, 24, 608243) I went in.
('88', 394, 5, 25, 608254) Mats were not properly kept.
('88', 394, 5, 26, 608283) I had the bedding of a boy unrolled.
('88', 394, 5, 27, 608320) It was very dirty.
('88', 394, 5, 28, 608339) The bed sheet was torn.
('88', 394, 5, 29, 608363) It was stitched in a couple of places, but very crudely.
('88', 394, 5, 30, 608420) The other tears had not been attended to.
('88', 394, 5, 31, 608462) They should have been patched.
('88', 394, 5, 32, 608493) If the sheet was too badly torn it could have been doubled and stitched.
('88', 394, 5, 33, 608566) Many times in jail I had got mattresses made that way.
('88', 394, 5, 34, 608621) They are warm and strong.
('88', 394, 5, 35, 608647) The cotton of the mattress had collected into big lumps.
('88', 394, 5, 36, 608704) It was not warm.
('88', 394, 5, 37, 608721) That cotton should have been taken out and carded again.
('88', 394, 5, 38, 608778) Several pieces of cloth were discovered from under the mattress.
('88', 394, 5, 39, 608843) They were very dirty.
('88', 394, 5, 40, 608865) I would have kept those pieces clean and used them for patching.
('88', 394, 5, 41, 608930) The mat was very dirty.
('88', 394, 5, 42, 608954) It should have been washed.
('88', 394, 6, 43, 608982) 1 Niece of Balvantsinha.
('88', 394, 6, 44, 609007) According to Balvantsinha Gajraj had complained to Gandhiji that Talimi Sangh was a very dirty place.
('88', 395, 0, 1, 609109) 396 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('88', 395, 1, 2, 609151) I examined the floor.
('88', 395, 1, 3, 609173) It is used for sleeping but is in a very bad state.
('88', 395, 1, 4, 609225) Pandey said cow dung was not available.
('88', 395, 1, 5, 609265) It is better if cow dung is available.
('88', 395, 1, 6, 609304) But one can do without it.
('88', 395, 1, 7, 609331) Where was there cow dung in South Africa?
('88', 395, 1, 8, 609373) We managed with earth.
('88', 395, 1, 9, 609396) There was a wooden shelf fixed to the wall for keeping things.
('88', 395, 1, 10, 609459) When I touched it my hand was covered with dust.
('88', 395, 1, 11, 609508) I wiped my hand on Pandey’s hand.
('88', 395, 1, 12, 609542) It also got covered with dust.
('88', 395, 1, 13, 609573) One boy had put his ink pot on the mat.
('88', 395, 1, 14, 609613) Where else was the poor boy to put it?
('88', 395, 1, 15, 609652) But there was no method about it.
('88', 395, 1, 16, 609686) I examined each and every pen and nib.
('88', 395, 1, 17, 609725) I saw also the ink pots.
('88', 395, 1, 18, 609750) That is my way.
('88', 395, 1, 19, 609766) That should also be the way of Nayee Talim.
('88', 395, 1, 20, 609810) Everything was wrong from my point of view.
('88', 395, 1, 21, 609854) These are small things.
('88', 395, 1, 22, 609878) But small things make up big things.
('88', 395, 1, 23, 609915) It does not required money.
('88', 395, 1, 24, 609943) It requires a keen vision, it requires art.
('88', 395, 1, 25, 609987) It is our duty to teach these.
('88', 395, 1, 26, 610018) It is the purpose of Nayee Talim.
('88', 395, 1, 27, 610052) It is the teacher’s fault if it is not done.
('88', 395, 1, 28, 610097) It is your fault.
('88', 395, 1, 29, 610115) I would say that it is my fault.
('88', 395, 1, 30, 610148) After all, the responsibility lies with me.
('88', 395, 1, 31, 610192) What is the point in starting a thing and then giving it up?
('88', 395, 1, 32, 610253) If someone says that in this way he can look after only one boy, I would say admit only one boy.
('88', 395, 1, 33, 610350) Do not admit more.
('88', 395, 1, 34, 610369) An element of untruth enters if we admit more boys and cannot look after them.
('88', 395, 1, 35, 610448) As I came out, I noticed the sacking you have hung up along the verandah.
('88', 395, 1, 36, 610522) For this I must quarrel with you.
('88', 395, 1, 37, 610556) A verandah is designed to admit air and sunlight.
('88', 395, 1, 38, 610606) By fixing sacking around it you shut out both.
('88', 395, 1, 39, 610653) And the room at the rear becomes absolutely useless.
('88', 395, 1, 40, 610706) If you say it can’t be helped because the boys are too many, I would say that we should take only as many boys as we can accommodate.
('88', 395, 1, 41, 610840) We should not take more.
('88', 395, 1, 42, 610865) Pandey’s mother Kodamba was in very dirty clothes.
('88', 395, 1, 43, 610916) She looked like a maid servant.
('88', 395, 1, 44, 610948) She did not even know Hindustani.
('88', 395, 1, 45, 610982) And she has been with us for two months.
('88', 395, 1, 46, 611023) Even Pandey’s own clothes were not quite all right.
('88', 395, 1, 47, 611075) The neck was open and so also the cuffs.
('88', 395, 1, 48, 611116) We are labourers.
('88', 395, 1, 49, 611134) Our shirts must have half sleeves.
('88', 395, 1, 50, 611169) Brass or glass buttons are useless for us.
('88', 395, 1, 51, 611212) I had a brief discussion with Asha Devi 1. But I am writing in detail because these matters, though small, are very important.
('88', 395, 1, 52, 611339) And failing in these points, we depart too far from our objective.
('88', 395, 1, 53, 611406) I have read this again.
('88', 395, 1, 54, 611430) It seems to be all right.

('88', 396, 3, 6, 611761) 1 While I am dictating this, Sushilabehn informs me that you have repaired the pump.
('88', 396, 3, 7, 611846) I knew that you would do it.
('88', 396, 3, 8, 611875) I knew your great ability for mechanical things.
('88', 396, 3, 9, 611924) Develop it fully and if any such work comes up in the Ashram continue doing it.
('88', 396, 3, 10, 612004) Go on observing the power of the spinning wheel.
('88', 396, 3, 11, 612053) I had noticed that your help had become inevitable in the camp run by Kanubhai.
('88', 396, 3, 12, 612133) I realized that you had culinary talent as well when I saw the bread and the biscuits you made with tomato juice in an ordinary oven.
('88', 396, 3, 13, 612267) I wish you would develop this talent too and give its full benefit to the Ashram.

('88', 396, 6, 17, 612471) November 30, 1945 I am not going to Bengal to serve four or five persons, but I am going to Bengal to serve crores of persons.
('88', 396, 7, 18, 612598) Referring to garba dance which the girls executed, Gandhiji said: No doubt garba dance is famous in the world but this is no time for such dance.
('88', 396, 8, 19, 612744) He said that he was going to Bengal to serve humanity and wished that the girls would shower blessings on him and pray for his successful programme.
('88', 396, 9, 20, 612893) Referring to the sari spun by the inmates of the Mahila Ashram from the yarn produced in non stop spinning during last Gandhi Jayanti, Gandhiji said that he would not like to take the sari with him.

('88', 397, 1, 2, 613394) 715. RATIONAL APPROACH TO NON VIOLENCE 1
('88', 397, 2, 3, 613435) According to me what the All India Congress Committee meant is clear.
('88', 397, 2, 4, 613505) If constructive work is not carried on keeping non violence in mind and accepting it rationally, India will not achieve swaraj as a result of it.
('88', 397, 2, 5, 613651) A lot of work always went on in our villages but it was not informed by the knowledge and the vision of non violence.
('88', 397, 2, 6, 613769) So all we achieved was that we did not become as bankrupt financially as we are today.
('88', 397, 2, 7, 613856) And when foreign invasion started, we abandoned the village industries one after another.
('88', 397, 2, 8, 613946) Work for eradication of untouchability, uplift of Adivasis, equal rights for women, imparting training and bridging the gulf between the poor and the rich and so on had never been taken up.
('88', 397, 2, 9, 614136) When we realized that to achieve real freedom the only royal way was that of non violence and truth, our range of vision extended to the whole of India and beyond it to the whole world, and despite India being a slave country its fame spread in the world.
('88', 397, 2, 10, 614392) I am firmly of opinion that if, as stated in the question, we forget all other aspects of non violence except non killing of human beings, non violence will not remain non violence, it will become bereft of truth, its universality will be lost and we shall never achieve swaraj.
('88', 397, 2, 11, 614671) If ahimsa includes destruction of others’ property, boycotting Government servants, going underground and so on, then, we can neither awaken the crores of people nor give them the correct training in fearlessness.
('88', 397, 2, 12, 614885) If we want to work non violently, then it is necessary to accept the restrictions laid down by me.
('88', 397, 2, 13, 614984) But if we do away with these restrictions then there will be no other alternative for us but to abandon non violence and to train the people for violence.
('88', 397, 2, 14, 615139) That this way is totally futile for us has been proved by this barbarous war.
('88', 397, 2, 15, 615217) At any rate by openly accepting the way of violence we save ourselves from deceiving our own people and the world at large.
('88', 397, 3, 16, 615341) [From Hindi] Khadi Jagat, November 1945
('88', 397, 4, 17, 615381) 1 This was in reply to the question : “How far is the inference correct that in trying to make non violence practical and progressive, people could arrest others or run away, go underground and destroy property but not kill or hurt anyone ?” It was to make this point clear that the All India Congress Committee deliberately added the words “accepting non violence rationally”.

('88', 398, 1, 2, 615805) 716. SPEECH ON NAYEE TALIM 1
('88', 398, 2, 3, 615834) November 1945 Nayee Talim means teaching through craft.
('88', 398, 2, 4, 615890) That basic craft has to be selected in the light of the conditions and produce of the region.
('88', 398, 2, 5, 615984) For instance, it would not be proper to have khadi as a means of teaching in a region where cotton does not grow, but has to be imported for the purpose.
('88', 398, 2, 6, 616138) If Nayee Talim can be proved to be self supporting through khadi, then the same thing can be applied to other industries too.
('88', 398, 2, 7, 616264) What I mean by making education self sustaining is this.
('88', 398, 2, 8, 616321) Just as the expense on food and clothing for the children studying in Government schools is borne by their parents, similarly, in Nayee Talim schools, parents will have to bear the expenses on food and clothing of their children.
('88', 398, 2, 9, 616551) But the expenses incurred in the schools of today on books and fees will be saved.
('88', 398, 2, 10, 616634) There should be no place for books in Nayee Talim.
('88', 398, 2, 11, 616685) Initially some expenses may have to be incurred on cotton, carding bow, and takli and so on.
('88', 398, 2, 12, 616778) Afterwards the only expenses will be on the teachers’ salaries, stationery, and the salaries of peons, etc., if they have to be engaged.
('88', 398, 2, 13, 616915) Suppose, there are thirty boys in one school.
('88', 398, 2, 14, 616961) They will handle all the processes right from collecting cotton from the field to spinning and weaving the yarn into cloth.
('88', 398, 2, 15, 617085) Through every process the teacher will educate them so that their intellect sharpens day by day.
('88', 398, 2, 16, 617182) This will result in students’ making ever new discoveries in the methods employed in the khadi industry which will make it more productive and profitable.
('88', 398, 2, 17, 617337) The cloth produced by students will be purchased by their parents at any price.
('88', 398, 2, 18, 617417) It will be the teacher’s duty to see that through his students he creates an awareness in their parents that they may not even touch foreign and mill made cloth.
('88', 398, 2, 19, 617579) We should also see that an atmosphere of self sufficiency in cloth and khadi is created.
('88', 398, 2, 20, 617668) We shall have to create an atmosphere of our own.
('88', 398, 2, 21, 617718) For bringing khadi to the stage it has reached today, we had to make efforts and create the climate.
('88', 398, 2, 22, 617819) As a result no one now can root out khadi.
('88', 398, 2, 23, 617862) The same thing can be said of Nayee Talim also.
('88', 398, 2, 24, 617910) If the teacher is unable to create the necessary atmosphere, Nayee Talim cannot become self reliant and cannot make headway.
('88', 398, 2, 25, 618035) If he succeeds in creating the atmosphere and sharpening the intellect of the students, then the entire expenditure from beginning to end on Nayee Talim can be met from the sale of
('88', 398, 3, 26, 618216) 1 This appeared under the title : “Self reliance in Nayee Talim”.
('88', 399, 0, 1, 618282) 400 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('88', 399, 1, 2, 618324) cloth produced by students.
('88', 399, 1, 3, 618352) Students will be equipped for earning when they leave our schools.
('88', 399, 1, 4, 618419) We do not promise them jobs.
('88', 399, 1, 5, 618448) The Government also does not promise employment to students who are trained at enormous expense in Government schools.
('88', 399, 1, 6, 618567) But our students will be brighter than the students of Government schools and will easily find occupations for themselves.
('88', 399, 1, 7, 618690) We must remember that when atmosphere had to be created for Government schools, they had to put in considerable effort in spite of the way being clear.
('88', 399, 1, 8, 618842) The atmosphere we have to create is for revival.
('88', 399, 1, 9, 618891) That which has been destroyed has to be revived in a new way and we look upon it as a peaceful way of attaining swaraj.
('88', 399, 1, 10, 619011) It should be easy to do this.
('88', 399, 1, 11, 619041) We do not find it easy as we have not gone to the villages with the correct attitude and have made no real attempts at all.
('88', 399, 1, 12, 619165) Now we have Nayee Talim.
('88', 399, 1, 13, 619190) If it does not work a miracle and develop power, then what is it good for?
('88', 399, 1, 14, 619265) We do not realize the full significance of boys and girls being entrusted to our care from their childhood and undergoing craft based education in our schools for seven years or more.
('88', 399, 1, 15, 619449) And the modern education which is being imparted to us teaches us that schooling can never become self supporting.
('88', 399, 1, 16, 619564) This creates some confusion in our minds.
('88', 399, 1, 17, 619606) It is my firm belief that if Nayee Talim cannot become self supporting, then the teachers do not understand what it is.
('88', 399, 1, 18, 619726) In my view, amongst other characteristics self reliance is the most important characteristic of Nayee Talim.
('88', 399, 1, 19, 619835) If this is so for the education of boys and girls, then adult education must also be self supporting.
('88', 399, 1, 20, 619937) If we believe that it is difficult to convince adults about the value of education, then I have to say that this is nothing but an old illusion.
('88', 399, 1, 21, 620082) And the teaching of the three R’s in adult education is no part of our Nayee Talim.
('88', 399, 1, 22, 620166) The meaning of adult education is that we will give them, through their own language, all round education of a pure and socially useful life.
('88', 399, 1, 23, 620308) And if they do not easily become self supporting, in my view there is some serious defect in that education.
('88', 399, 1, 24, 620417) We should not also forget that complete co operation should be the basis from the very beginning.
('88', 399, 1, 25, 620515) Those who know the full meaning of co operation will raise no doubts about self reliance.
('88', 399, 2, 26, 620605) QUESTION: Today only those students go to Government schools whose parents can pay for their food and clothing.
('88', 399, 2, 27, 620717) We expect that under Nayee Talim, all the children of a village will go to school.
('88', 399, 2, 28, 620800) There may be many among them who do not have the necessary food and clothing in their homes.
('88', 399, 2, 29, 620893) What is the responsibility of Nayee Talim in such cases?
('88', 400, 0, 1, 620950) VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 6 DECEMBER, 1945 401
('88', 400, 1, 2, 620996) A. I have just stated the ideal that parents will provide for food and clothes.
('88', 400, 1, 3, 621076) Even now boys do eat and wear clothes.
('88', 400, 1, 4, 621115) The parents will pay to school whatever they spend on their children’s food and clothing.
('88', 400, 1, 5, 621205) The diet we give will have a scientific basis.
('88', 400, 1, 6, 621252) The expense will be a little more because of the milk.
('88', 400, 1, 7, 621307) That expense will be met by the school.
('88', 400, 1, 8, 621347) But when we persuade the parents to bear the expense on food, then they will pay for milk too.
('88', 400, 1, 9, 621442) Those who are very poor will be very few; but if they are really poor then we can certainly bear the entire expense.
('88', 400, 1, 10, 621559) I shall not worry about what clothes the girls and boys should wear because my ideal for them is a loin cloth or clothes that a baby wears.
('88', 400, 1, 11, 621699) It may be a brief kuchchha.
('88', 400, 1, 12, 621727) We can easily make it.
('88', 400, 1, 13, 621750) When girls develop breasts something will have to be done to cover them.
('88', 400, 1, 14, 621823) The answer is a piece of cloth of the kind that is in vogue in the South.
('88', 400, 1, 15, 621897) It is a different matter what provision is to be made in winters.
('88', 400, 1, 16, 621963) You may not provide them any wraps but you must give them enough to wear.
('88', 400, 1, 17, 622037) All this will be our property—the boys and girls of the same age group will wear them.
('88', 400, 1, 18, 622124) One thing should be kept in mind, that these boys and girls will stay with us most of the time.
('88', 400, 1, 19, 622220) We can easily bear all this expense.
('88', 400, 1, 20, 622257) According to us the clothes for the poor and the rich will be the same.
('88', 400, 1, 21, 622329) If the clothes are clean and of the right size, they will look as neat and tidy as naked children look.
('88', 400, 2, 22, 622433) Q. (a) Will there be an increase in the demand for cloth if an atmosphere of self reliance in cloth is generated?
('88', 400, 3, 23, 622547) (b) Even if parents want to purchase cloth produced by their children, do they have the means to pay the price that we may ask for it?
('88', 400, 3, 24, 622682) A. Any price must of course mean reasonable price.
('88', 400, 3, 25, 622733) This merely means that those who do not even touch khadi today, will certainly buy the cloth made by their children if we sell it at a reasonable price.
('88', 400, 3, 26, 622886) There will be no question of making a large profit on it.
('88', 400, 3, 27, 622944) The price of every item will be different but by and large the difference between the cost price and the selling price will be almost the same.
('88', 400, 3, 28, 623088) Even if the price of fancy goods is higher, still comparatively it will be much cheaper.
('88', 400, 3, 29, 623177) Those who buy them will pay the price willingly.
('88', 400, 3, 30, 623226) When self reliance in cloth is achieved, everyone will accept khadi and will do so willingly.
('88', 400, 3, 31, 623320) Then Nayee Talim will have reached its peak.
('88', 400, 3, 32, 623365) Not one will even care for me if this happens during my lifetime.
('88', 400, 3, 33, 623431) All my answers apply to the present time, the present conditions.
('88', 400, 4, 34, 623497) Q. Training of teachers is a vast field that we have before us.
('88', 400, 4, 35, 623561) In what way are we to practise self reliance in this training.
('88', 401, 0, 1, 623624) 402 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('88', 401, 1, 2, 623666) A. Your question is, how can those who have come here to be teachers become self reliant?
('88', 401, 1, 3, 623756) If young students can become self reliant, the teachers must become self reliant.
('88', 401, 1, 4, 623838) The question is only one of bearing the expense of one’s own food, clothing and education.
('88', 401, 1, 5, 623929) My point is that if teachers themselves cannot become self reliant, how can they make the students self reliant?
('88', 401, 1, 6, 624042) In fact well to do persons who have come here not for salary but for service, will not need any supervision.
('88', 401, 1, 7, 624151) They will learn all occupations attentively and carefully.
('88', 401, 1, 8, 624210) They will not waste anything because of carelessness.
('88', 401, 1, 9, 624264) Such people will be able to meet their entire expenses from whatever occupation they undertake.
('88', 401, 1, 10, 624360) Your curriculum ought to be such that teachers and students can earn enough for their expenses while they learn.
('88', 401, 1, 11, 624473) You too will be put to the test in preparing such a curriculum.
('88', 401, 1, 12, 624537) I like this question very much because it is a good sign that you have raised this question in the very beginning.
('88', 401, 1, 13, 624652) Aryanayakum has written: “I have understood and agree with it.” This means that I also should have the same thing in mind that he has.
('88', 401, 1, 14, 624787) If your syllabus is not based on the above lines, let me know.
('88', 401, 1, 15, 624850) Perhaps I may be able to make it with your help.
('88', 401, 1, 16, 624899) I go so far as to say that even wood should not be available free of charge.
('88', 401, 1, 17, 624976) Bear in mind that we want to work in co operation.
('88', 401, 1, 18, 625027) We also want to learn true co operation.
('88', 401, 1, 19, 625068) Hence the fruits of everyone’s intelligence and skill should go into one pool.
('88', 401, 1, 20, 625147) As I go on writing the subject becomes more and more interesting to me.
('88', 401, 1, 21, 625219) I become more and more confirmed in my belief that self reliance is the key to our success.
('88', 401, 1, 22, 625311) This is proved by long experience.

('88', 402, 4, 14, 626572) You will see that I have left the place of the Panchayats at the taluka and district level rather vague.
('88', 402, 4, 15, 626677) They are only advisory bodies.
('88', 402, 4, 16, 626708) Why should they be given a place in the legal framework?
('88', 402, 4, 17, 626765) Even the necessity for their existence is a matter of doubt.
('88', 402, 4, 18, 626826) When the villages really come to life, the need for advisory bodies should be less.
('88', 402, 4, 19, 626910) The Provincial Panchayat would attend to everything and would get things done through talukas and districts.
('88', 402, 4, 20, 627019) If you think there is any snag in this line of thinking let me know.
('88', 402, 4, 21, 627088) I have put in as much hurried reading as I could.
('88', 402, 4, 22, 627138) It is worth I considering if Pakistan and the Princes can have any place in my conception [of India].
('88', 402, 4, 23, 627240) Remember that the Gandhian plan can be successful only if it can be achieved through non violent means.

('88', 403, 5, 8, 627875) I am of the opinion that the fund that we have will be enough for the training in handicrafts and adult education.
('88', 403, 5, 9, 627990) If both the activities go on together the expenses will be lessened.
('88', 403, 5, 10, 628059) These funds should not be made to cover the other five activities.
('88', 403, 5, 11, 628126) This does not mean that we are not to pursue those five activities or that they are of secondary importance.
('88', 403, 5, 12, 628235) We shall conduct them with a separate fund.
('88', 403, 5, 13, 628279) If we think of all the seven activities we may not be able to deal with any one.
('88', 403, 5, 14, 628360) I am therefore of the opinion that this fund should be earmarked only for the two activities.
('88', 403, 5, 15, 628454) Even when the fund grows later on, it should be limited to only the two activities.
('88', 403, 5, 16, 628538) Of course all this requires hard work and intelligence.
('88', 403, 5, 17, 628594) If necessary you may use this letter.

('88', 404, 1, 2, 629293) Another journalist asked Mahatmaji: “Can we send what you said for publication?” Mahatmaji laughed and said: Cook it, digest it and assimilate it.
('88', 404, 1, 3, 629440) Use your journalistic sense and you will see what I have given you is something other than a stunt.
('88', 404, 2, 4, 629540) Questioned regarding his reactions to major questions of the day, Gandhiji said: Great problems lie before us and as and when they arise, my views will be there.
('88', 404, 3, 5, 629702) He declined to commit himself further.
('88', 404, 4, 6, 629741) When one of the newspapermen queried him about his travel from Wardha, Gandhiji, with his proverbial fund of wit, retorted jokingly: You have been travelling with me and if your journalistic instinct does not prompt you to answer that question, resign your post and take to something more useful in life.

('88', 404, 6, 9, 630108) SODEPUR, December 1, 1945
('88', 404, 7, 10, 630134) He began by referring to his attempts made since 1914, when he was in England to learn Bengali.
('88', 404, 7, 11, 630230) He made some progress in it, though he could not keep up his Bengali studies.
('88', 404, 7, 12, 630308) It was his ambition to be able to speak to the people of Bengal in Bengali so that he might be able to penetrate into their hearts.
('88', 404, 7, 13, 630440) He was sorry he could not do so on the present occasion.
('88', 404, 7, 14, 630497) He was also of the opinion that no Indian could call himself a full fledged citizen of India unless he could speak to the people of the various provinces in their own tongues.
('88', 404, 7, 15, 630673) Failing this proficiency in the different languages it was the duty of every Indian to learn at least Hindustani which alone could be the rashtrabhasha 1 of India.
('88', 404, 8, 16, 630837) He then proceeded to give the etiology of his present visit to Bengal.
('88', 404, 8, 17, 630908) Ever since his release from prison, he had been anxious to visit Bengal but he could not do so owing to ill health.
('88', 404, 8, 18, 631024) Moreover, he did not want to visit Bengal unless he was sure that the authorities would welcome his visit and that there would be no restrictions on his movements.
('88', 404, 8, 19, 631188) He was not prepared to submit to any restrictive orders on the one hand or on the other to offer civil disobedience against such orders under conditions now prevailing in the country.
('88', 404, 8, 20, 631372) Even after the way for his visit to Bengal was clear it had to be postponed for several months on account of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel who

('88', 405, 1, 2, 631572) was in need of nature cure treatment and needed his (Gandhiji’s) presence by his side.
('88', 405, 1, 3, 631659) He was glad, however, that after all he had been able to come to Bengal.
('88', 405, 2, 4, 631732) Explaining next the object of his visit, Gandhiji said that it was purely to offer whatever consolation his presence in their midst could give to the victims of Bengal famine and to do whatever he could to relieve their distress.
('88', 405, 2, 5, 631962) He had not come to take part in the politics of the province or in the forthcoming elections.
('88', 405, 2, 6, 632056) In fact, as they all knew, he took very little interest in these things.
('88', 405, 2, 7, 632129) Where his chief interest lay was too well known to need reiteration.
('88', 405, 3, 8, 632198) Mahatmaji then concluded after appealing to the people assembled to contribute their mite to the Harijan Fund as a token of their sympathy with the cause of the abolition of untouchability as also to ameliorate the condition of Harijans.
('88', 405, 3, 9, 632436) Incidentally he mentioned that in this way he had collected 2 lakhs of rupees for the Harijans since his release.
('88', 405, 3, 10, 632550) The proceeds of the autograph fees that he charged were earmarked for the Harijan Fund.
('88', 405, 3, 11, 632638) Anyone by paying a fee of Rs. 5 could have his autograph.
('88', 405, 3, 12, 632696) There could be no exemption on the ground of poverty because according to him the autograph hunting was essentially a rich man’s hobby.
('88', 405, 3, 13, 632832) Anyway, there was none poorer than the Harijans and consequently none had a right to cheat the Harijans out of the autograph fees which had been premortgaged to them.

('88', 405, 6, 16, 633067) SODEPUR, [On or after December 1, 1945] 2
('88', 405, 7, 17, 633109) GANDHIJI: Arguing on those lines, you will be able to understand the prejudice in South Africa too.
('88', 405, 7, 18, 633209) The root cause—a false notion of preservation of the race and economic status—is common to both.
('88', 405, 7, 19, 633306) The difference is only one of degree.
('88', 405, 7, 20, 633344) If you apply concrete facts to individual cases it is half a dozen of one and six of the other.
('88', 405, 7, 21, 633440) It is on a par with the racial prejudice here.
('88', 405, 8, 22, 633487) IAN STEPHENS: Oh, no.
('88', 405, 8, 23, 633509) Here it is much less.
('88', 405, 8, 24, 633531) G. Yes, owing to the vast disparity in numbers.
('88', 405, 8, 25, 633579) But take the case of the individual who actually suffers.
('88', 405, 8, 26, 633637) His experience does not differ from that of the coloured men in South Africa or America.
('88', 405, 9, 27, 633726) 1 This report by Pyarelal appeared under the title “With an English Friend”.
('88', 405, 9, 28, 633803) Ian Stephens, a correspondent of The Statesman, Calcutta, was of the opinion that colour bar and racial segregation was at its worst in South Africa, and did not agree with Gandhiji that it was equally bad in America.
('88', 405, 9, 29, 634021) 2 Gandhiji reached Sodepur on December 1, 1945.
('88', 406, 0, 1, 634069) VOL.88 : 30 AUGUST, 1945 6 DECEMBER, 1945 407
('88', 406, 1, 2, 634115) I. S. We, Englishmen are apt to forget that side of the question.
('88', 406, 2, 3, 634181) G. Habit becomes second nature.
('88', 406, 2, 4, 634213) There may be no deliberate intention either.
('88', 406, 3, 5, 634258) I. S. In the Punjab and Delhi races mix much more freely than elsewhere.
('88', 406, 3, 6, 634331) Was that due to the fact that the disparity in numbers was comparatively less there?
('88', 406, 4, 7, 634416) Gandhiji was of opinion that the contrast presented by Bengal in this respect was perhaps due to the violent spirit having manifested itself there on a much larger scale than in Delhi or in the Punjab.
('88', 406, 4, 8, 634618) The Punjab did show the violent spirit in some measure.
('88', 406, 4, 9, 634674) But it was not a patch upon Bengal.
('88', 406, 4, 10, 634710) The daring of the Chittagong Armoury Raid was neither attempted nor duplicated anywhere else.
('88', 406, 5, 11, 634804) I. S. I have often thought over it, and it has always baffled me how these Bengali young men, so gentle by nature, have drifted into violence.
('88', 406, 6, 12, 634947) G. I have solved it for myself.
('88', 406, 6, 13, 634979) They feel they have been unjustly libelled in the past.
('88', 406, 6, 14, 635035) Lord Curzon harped on their softness.
('88', 406, 6, 15, 635073) It soured them.
('88', 406, 6, 16, 635089) So they say, ‘We may not be wealthy, but surely we are not effeminate.’ So they adopted this devious method and surpassed every other province in daring.
('88', 406, 6, 17, 635243) They defied death, defied poverty and even public opinion.
('88', 406, 6, 18, 635302) I have discussed this question of violence threadbare with so many terrorists and anarchists.
('88', 406, 6, 19, 635396) It is terrible whether the Arab does it or the Jew.
('88', 406, 6, 20, 635448) It is a bad outlook for the world if this spirit of violence takes hold of the mass mind.
('88', 406, 6, 21, 635538) Ultimately in destroying itself it destroys the race.
('88', 406, 7, 22, 635592) I. S. And it has spread all over the world for the last two or three years.
('88', 406, 8, 23, 635668) G. Look at the latest ukase of Gen.
('88', 406, 8, 24, 635704) MacArthur 1. He has divided the entire Japanese nation into two categories, those whom he calls war criminals and those who do not come under that label.
('88', 406, 8, 25, 635858) As I read it, it struck me that this was not the best way to introduce democracy among the Japanese—a race so proud, so sensitive, so highly organized along Western lines.
('88', 406, 8, 26, 636030) They will do what the Italians did in Garibaldi’s time on a much larger scale.
('88', 406, 8, 27, 636109) You cannot deal with the human race on these lines.
('88', 406, 8, 28, 636161) Whatever happens in one part of the world will affect the other parts.
('88', 406, 8, 29, 636232) The world has so shrunk.
('88', 406, 9, 30, 636257) This evoked from the friend the observation that he did not think that the world had deteriorated so much theoretically as it might have during the last three years.
('88', 406, 9, 31, 636423) Gandhiji agreed with him though his grounds, he remarked, were different.
('88', 406, 10, 32, 636497) I. S. My reason for that belief is that in spite of the fact that suffering, for

('88', 407, 1, 2, 636720) instance in Indonesia and elsewhere, has been appalling during the last three years, the human mind has not been equally warped.
('88', 407, 2, 3, 636849) G. My hope is based on a detached view of the situation.
('88', 407, 2, 4, 636906) Whilst in detention in the Aga Khan Palace I had leisure to read and think.
('88', 407, 2, 5, 636982) What struck me was that whilst practice showed deterioration, the mind of man had very much progressed.
('88', 407, 2, 6, 637086) Practice has not been able to keep pace with the mind.
('88', 407, 2, 7, 637141) Man has begun to say, ‘This is wrong, that is wrong.’ Whereas previously he justified his conduct, he now no longer justifies his own or his neighbour’s.
('88', 407, 2, 8, 637295) He wants to set right the wrong but does not know that his own practice fails him.
('88', 407, 2, 9, 637378) The contradiction between his thought and conduct fetters him.
('88', 407, 2, 10, 637441) His conduct is not governed by logic.
('88', 407, 2, 11, 637479) Then, of course, there is my standing prediction in favour of non violence that it will prevail— whatever man may or may not do.
('88', 407, 2, 12, 637608) That keeps my optimism alive.
('88', 407, 2, 13, 637638) Extensive personal experience too confirms my belief that non violence is self acting.
('88', 407, 2, 14, 637725) It will have its way and overcome all obstacles irrespective of the shortcomings of the instruments.
('88', 407, 2, 15, 637826) It makes no difference how we arrive at our conclusion, but it keeps us fresh and green.
('88', 407, 3, 16, 637915) The conversation next turned upon Gandhiji’s pet theme of living up to 125 years.
('88', 407, 3, 17, 637997) Gandhiji’s visitor wanted to know how he managed to keep physically fit.
('88', 407, 3, 18, 638070) Gandhiji replied that outwardly he owed his physical fitness to strict adherence to regular habits in eating, drinking and sleeping and to his partiality for nature cure principles which he had adopted strictly in life since 1901. Reminiscently he described how up till 1901 he used the medicine bottle but had almost thrown it away and for forty five years he had lived more or less according to nature cure principles.
('88', 407, 4, 19, 638491) G. But, in a still greater measure, it is due to the practice of detachment of mind.
('88', 407, 4, 20, 638576) By detachment I mean that you must not worry whether the desired result follows from your action or not, so long as your motive is pure, your means correct.
('88', 407, 4, 21, 638733) Really, it means that things will come right in the end if you take care of the means and leave the rest to Him.
('88', 407, 5, 22, 638846) He based his belief on the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita which he had called his “dictionary of action”.
('88', 407, 6, 23, 638952) The friend remarked on the close analogy between the teaching of the Bhagavad Gita and the thesis presented in Aldous Huxley’s 1 Ends and Means.
('88', 407, 6, 24, 639097) The mention of Aldous Huxley’s name revived in Gandhiji’s mind memories of old days
('88', 407, 7, 25, 639181) 1 British novelist and critic; in later life became increasingly drawn to Hindu philosophy.

('88', 408, 1, 2, 639319) about Aldous Huxley’s father 1 whose writings he used to read during his student days in London in 1889.
('88', 408, 2, 3, 639424) I. S. But there is a physical side all the same?
('88', 408, 3, 4, 639473) G. Yes, only I attach greater importance to the mental.
('88', 408, 3, 5, 639529) What you think you become.
('88', 408, 3, 6, 639556) Thought is never complete unless it finds expression in action and action limits your thought.
('88', 408, 3, 7, 639651) It is only when there is a perfect accord between the two that there is full, natural life.
('88', 408, 4, 8, 639743) I. S. But what about the legacy of one’s past life?
('88', 408, 4, 9, 639795) It cannot be written off the balance sheet.
('88', 408, 5, 10, 639839) G. I have my answer for that.
('88', 408, 5, 11, 639869) If my past conduct does not warrant the full span of life, no matter however correct my present life may be, I can still counteract the effect of past mistakes by attaining complete detachment between the mind and the body.
('88', 408, 5, 12, 640093) Detachment enables one to overcome the effects of past faulty practice as well as handicaps of heredity and environment.
('88', 408, 5, 13, 640214) Normally speaking, every deviation from the rule of nature, whether ignorant or wilful, e.
('88', 408, 5, 14, 640305) g., anger, ill temper, impatience, errors in conjugal life, exacts its toll.
('88', 408, 5, 15, 640382) But there is this promise that if you have arrived at complete detachment you can rub out all these.
('88', 408, 5, 16, 640483) “Except ye be born again, ye cannot have everlasting life.” Conversely, you can have everlasting life if you are “born again”.
('88', 408, 5, 17, 640610) There is no hurdle placed before death.
('88', 408, 5, 18, 640650) You can turn over a new leaf and begin life anew here and now; the past will not disturb its tenor provided you have completely severed yourself from it and its legacy by the axe of detachment.
('88', 408, 6, 19, 640844) On the previous occasion when this friend had visited Gandhiji, Gandhiji had done all the talking and the friend had listened.
('88', 408, 6, 20, 640971) This time Gandhiji had intended that he would only speak in answer to questions and let the friend do the talking but the friend again had the better of his resolve.
('88', 408, 6, 21, 641137) Gandhiji remarked, discomfited, at the end of their talk: I admit defeat.
('88', 408, 6, 22, 641211) After all you are a practised journalist.
('88', 408, 7, 23, 641253) I. S. I am only human.

('88', 409, 4, 5, 641548) F. A. U. MEMBER: However much we may want to be friendly the past tradition clings round your necks and drives you to desperation.
('88', 409, 4, 6, 641679) It seems to me, that there is hardly any hope of giving to a young Bengali student an idea of the better side of Englishmen unless perhaps he is transferred to England.
('88', 409, 4, 7, 641848) The atmosphere in India is so poisoned that I wonder if it would not be better for Englishmen not to attempt to come to work in India just now but to wait for better times.
('88', 409, 5, 8, 642021) GANDHIJI: Any friend, who is a real friend, and who comes in a spirit of service, not as a superior, is bound to be welcome.
('88', 409, 5, 9, 642146) India, when she has come into her own will need all such assistance.
('88', 409, 5, 10, 642215) The distrust of Englishmen, as you say, is there.
('88', 409, 5, 11, 642265) It won’t disappear even by transporting Indian students to England.
('88', 409, 5, 12, 642333) You have got to understand it and live it down.
('88', 409, 5, 13, 642381) It has its roots in history.
('88', 409, 5, 14, 642410) The late Charlie Andrews and I were bed fellows.
('88', 409, 5, 15, 642459) There were scarcely a thought in our mind which we did not share.
('88', 409, 5, 16, 642525) He even adopted Indian dress though sometimes with grotesque results.
('88', 409, 5, 17, 642595) But even he could not escape suspicion.
('88', 409, 5, 18, 642635) He was even dubbed “a spy”.
('88', 409, 5, 19, 642663) His was a very sensitive spirit.
('88', 409, 5, 20, 642696) He suffered unspeakable anguish under these unmerited attacks and I was hard put to it to dispel the baseless distrust.
('88', 409, 5, 21, 642816) ‘If he is a spy, I am a spy,’ I said to these critics.
('88', 409, 5, 22, 642871) In the end C. F. A.’s spirit triumphed.
('88', 409, 5, 23, 642911) Pearson 2 was C. F. Andrews’ disciple and friend.
('88', 409, 5, 24, 642961) He too came in for his share of distrust.
('88', 409, 5, 25, 643003) Then there is Stocks 3. “If I am to serve India I must become an Indian,” he said to himself and married a Christian Rajput.
('88', 409, 5, 26, 643128) He was boycotted by the Rajputs.
('88', 409, 5, 27, 643161) The Government distrusted him too in the beginning.
('88', 409, 5, 28, 643213) But he has lived down the distrust of both
('88', 409, 6, 29, 643256) 1 Gandhiji reached Calcutta on December 1. 2 W. W. Pearson, a British missionary worker in Bengal and for some time a teacher in Santiniketan 3 Samuel Stokes, a British missionary and an associate of C. F. Andrews.
('88', 409, 6, 30, 643471) He was a member of the Congress and courted arrest in 1920; became a Hindu to deliver the message of Jesus to the Hindus; changed his name to Satyanand, and took up work for the uplift of the Hill tribes at Kotgarh.

('88', 410, 1, 2, 643733) the Government and Indians.
('88', 410, 1, 3, 643761) If then, even a C. F. Andrews and a Stokes and others had to labour under distrust, for you to be distrusted may not be wondered at.
('88', 410, 1, 4, 643894) So far Indians have known Englishmen only as members of the ruling race—supercilious when they were not patronizing.
('88', 410, 1, 5, 644011) The man in the street makes no distinction between such an Englishman and a good, humble European, between the Empire builder Englishman of the old type that he has known and the new type that is now coming into being, burning to make reparation for what his forefathers did.
('88', 410, 1, 6, 644287) Therefore, if one has not got the fire of sacrifice in him I would say to him: ‘Do not come to India just now.’ But if you are cast in a heroic mould there will be no difficulty.
('88', 410, 1, 7, 644466) You will in the end be taken at your worth if you persevere.
('88', 410, 1, 8, 644527) Anyway those of you who are here have no reason for going back.
('88', 410, 2, 9, 644591) The same friend was able to elicit from Gandhiji what he considered to be the weak spots in the Indusco Plan of Chinese co operatives.
('88', 410, 2, 10, 644726) Firstly, the Indusco was a product of abnormal times.
('88', 410, 2, 11, 644780) Its production was war time and war purposes production stimulated by the Japanese blockade.
('88', 410, 2, 12, 644873) Secondly, it was organized by foreign missionary enterprise and their work was tainted by the proselytization motive.
('88', 410, 3, 13, 644991) G. If you try to merely copy the Chinese co operatives in India you will end in miserable failure.
('88', 410, 3, 14, 645090) Here you have to work among Indian Christians.
('88', 410, 3, 15, 645137) The temperament is different, the character is different, and the circumstances are different.
('88', 410, 3, 16, 645232) Co operation which is rooted in the soil always works.
('88', 410, 3, 17, 645287) You have therefore to find out for yourself what type of co operative is best suited to the Indian temperament and soil.
('88', 410, 3, 18, 645408) Even those who have become converts to orthodox Christianity are today veering round.
('88', 410, 4, 19, 645494) M. By “veering round” you mean going back?
('88', 410, 5, 20, 645537) G. Yes, I mean going back to real Christianity, to Christ, not Western Christianity.
('88', 410, 5, 21, 645622) They are beginning to realize that Jesus was an Asiatic.
('88', 410, 5, 22, 645679) Having seen this they are reading their Bible through Indian eyes.
('88', 410, 5, 23, 645746) You should study the meaning of Indian Christianity through J. C. Kumarappa’s book Practice and Precepts of Jesus.

('88', 411, 2, 3, 645967) [December 2, 1945] Rajendra Prasad is a true patriot.
('88', 411, 2, 4, 646021) Long live Rajendra Prasad.

('88', 411, 4, 6, 646069) 725. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING
('88', 411, 5, 7, 646099) SODEPUR, December 2, 1945
('88', 411, 6, 8, 646125) Addressing the congregation after the prayer Gandhiji said he would like to thank them and congratulate them because they had maintained silence and were peaceful during the prayer.
('88', 411, 6, 9, 646307) The gathering of this evening was very big indeed.
('88', 411, 6, 10, 646358) On Saturday the prayer meeting was less crowded.
('88', 411, 6, 11, 646407) On both the days they had shown remarkable discipline.
('88', 411, 6, 12, 646462) So he would thank them and hope they would continue to behave calmly in future also.
('88', 411, 7, 13, 646547) The prayer song which was sung this evening had a special significance.
('88', 411, 7, 14, 646619) Gandhiji said it was very appropriate in the conditions obtaining at present.
('88', 411, 7, 15, 646697) The song was also sung in a very melodious tune.
('88', 411, 8, 16, 646746) In the song there was an appeal to God to lead humanity from darkness to light.
('88', 411, 8, 17, 646826) It said the humanity was engulfed in thickening darkness and had lost vision.
('88', 411, 8, 18, 646904) So they were praying to God to give them strength and lead them to light.
('88', 411, 9, 19, 646978) The import of the song was that they must be freed from all bondage and attain enlightenment.
('88', 411, 9, 20, 647072) The freedom from bondage also included the winning of swaraj.
('88', 411, 9, 21, 647134) India wanted release from the bondage.
('88', 411, 9, 22, 647173) We are all engulfed in darkness today.
('88', 411, 9, 23, 647212) Not only India but the world also is engulfed in darkness.
('88', 411, 9, 24, 647271) India wants peace.
('88', 411, 9, 25, 647290) So also does the entire world.
('88', 411, 9, 26, 647321) We are all travellers groping in that thickening darkness.
('88', 411, 9, 27, 647380) We are all blind and cannot feel the absence of light.
('88', 411, 9, 28, 647435) The prayer we have offered is the most important thing of this evening.
('88', 411, 9, 29, 647507) I was in South Africa when I used to pray privately.
('88', 411, 9, 30, 647560) When I returned to India I saw the necessity of holding mass prayers.
('88', 411, 10, 31, 647630) 1 The news report which carried the item was dated December 2, and was exclusively published in Advance on the occasion of Rajendra Prasad’s 61th birthday.

('88', 412, 1, 2, 647832) been holding mass prayers since then.
('88', 412, 1, 3, 647870) There is of course the necessity of individual praying in his own way.
('88', 412, 1, 4, 647941) Our prayer today to God is to lead us from darkness to light, from untruth to truth, and let us have peace—peace not only for India but for the entire world.
('88', 412, 2, 5, 648099) Gandhiji said he did not like the shouting of slogans.
('88', 412, 2, 6, 648154) The shouting of slogans disturbed the peaceful atmosphere which was the condition prerequisite to holding prayer.
('88', 412, 2, 7, 648268) So he would request them not to distrub the peaceful atmosphere of the place by shouting slogans.
('88', 412, 3, 8, 648366) In conclusion, Gandhiji asked the gathering to remove untouchability from their midst.
('88', 412, 3, 9, 648453) Untouchability was a slur on humanity.
('88', 412, 4, 10, 648492) Gandhiji then requested those who had assembled to contribute their mite to the Harijan Fund.

('88', 412, 7, 13, 648653) SODEPUR, December 2, 1945 I know your love for me.
('88', 412, 7, 14, 648704) I also want to love you.
('88', 412, 7, 15, 648729) I also want to win your heart.
('88', 412, 7, 16, 648760) But that I want to achieve through work.
('88', 412, 7, 17, 648801) Do not ask for my darshan or want to touch my feet.
('88', 412, 7, 18, 648853) I am not God; I am a human being.
('88', 412, 7, 19, 648887) I am an old man and my capacity to stand the strain is limited.
('88', 412, 7, 20, 648951) If I am to appear before you again and again my strength will be exhausted.
('88', 412, 7, 21, 649027) And I will not be able to do work.
('88', 412, 7, 22, 649062) So my request to you is that you should not ask for my darshan or request me to stand before you so that you may touch my feet.
('88', 412, 7, 23, 649190) If you come at prayer time you will have my darshan.
('88', 412, 7, 24, 649243) But I want to impress upon you that I like peace.
('88', 412, 7, 25, 649293) I do not like shouting of slogans or claps.
('88', 412, 7, 26, 649337) They irritate me.
('88', 412, 7, 27, 649355) If you love me you will not do so.

('88', 417, 6, 11, 655045) May be you are not acquainted with my views as they have progressed.
('88', 417, 6, 12, 655114) They were of course implicit in all my writings but of late they have become more explicit.
('88', 417, 6, 13, 655206) I have no longer any interest in marriages, whether within the caste, inter caste or even interprovincial.
('88', 417, 6, 14, 655313) Therefore, so far as possible, I do not say anything anywhere on the subject of marriages.
('88', 417, 6, 15, 655404) As it is I hardly ever attended any and now I have firmly stopped attending them altogether.
('88', 417, 6, 16, 655497) What I believe is that if we want to preserve whatever is good in varnashrama every Hindu has to become not only a Shudra but an atishudra 1, and regard himself as such.
('88', 417, 6, 17, 655667) And as a true indication of it marriages should really take place only between atishudras and the so called other varnas.
('88', 417, 6, 18, 655789) These marriages also should be not for the sake of indulgence but so as to observe restraint and keeping in mind the restrictions it implies.

('88', 417, 6, 20, 655967) Ramakant and Chi.
('88', 417, 6, 21, 655985) May they be happy, live in restraint and may their alliance be doubly devoted to service.
('88', 417, 6, 22, 656075) Often after a marriage instead of one sevak multiplying into two both the parties drop out of service.
('88', 417, 6, 23, 656178) This is my experience.
('88', 417, 6, 24, 656201) There are exceptions, and may this union be one such.
('88', 417, 6, 25, 656255) To that end pure restraint on your part will prove helpful to them in every field.
('88', 417, 6, 26, 656338) The Medical Board has not been lax; it has to do work that is vast in scope.
('88', 417, 6, 27, 656415) Besides, they are contemplating a co ordination of the various systems of medicine; so the matter it seems will take some time.
('88', 417, 6, 28, 656543) Let me also add that although I have a great regard for

('88', 418, 4, 8, 656958) SODEPUR, December 4, 1945
('88', 418, 5, 9, 656984) BHAI SAILEN It is thought, and it has been my experience, that through the power of prayer, heart felt prayer, one can achieve what cannot be achieved by any other power.
('88', 418, 5, 10, 657155) Swaraj is a very small thing.
('88', 418, 5, 11, 657185) But prayer should not be recited mechanically.
('88', 418, 5, 12, 657232) True prayer transforms the life of a man.
('88', 418, 5, 13, 657274) Your second question displays sheer ignorance on your part.
('88', 418, 5, 14, 657334) When did I say that I would live up to 125 years?
('88', 418, 5, 15, 657384) If I can be so arrogant I shall be God as the questioner says.
('88', 418, 5, 16, 657447) On the contrary I do not know whether I shall be able to take the next breath.
('88', 418, 5, 17, 657526) What I have said is that I want to live for 125 years while rendering service.
('88', 418, 5, 18, 657605) And I have also said that all should aspire to that end.
('88', 418, 5, 19, 657662) We can only wish.

('88', 418, 8, 24, 657805) SODEPUR, December 4, 1945
('88', 418, 9, 25, 657831) Gandhiji explained that the real purpose of the prayer could not be fulfilled unless the congregation became calm and quiet.
('88', 418, 9, 26, 657956) I have just seen that a crowd of people have entered the prayer ground after we have finished the prayer.
('88', 418, 9, 27, 658062) I must remind you all that the prayer begins punctually at 5 p.
('88', 418, 9, 28, 658126) (Bengal Time).
('88', 418, 9, 29, 658141) Those who want to join the prayer must reach the place earlier.
('88', 418, 10, 30, 658205) Proceeding, Gandhiji said that he was happy that such a big gathering attended his prayer.
('88', 418, 10, 31, 658296) He was also happy that those who had unfortunately came late had imbibed the mass feeling and stood at the edge of the congregation and listened to what he had
('88', 418, 11, 32, 658456) 1 According to the source the gathering included British, American and Chinese nationals as also a large number of women students.

('88', 419, 1, 3, 658661) Even though they could not take part in the prayer they were very silent.
('88', 419, 1, 4, 658735) That attitude, said Gandhiji, was what the prayer intended to teach the average man.
('88', 419, 1, 5, 658820) It was called self control and was a great factor of human life.
('88', 419, 1, 6, 658885) For the last sixteen years he had practised it.
('88', 419, 1, 7, 658933) Whenever he was late in attending any meeting or function he decided better not to go at all as otherwise he was sure to disturb others.
('88', 419, 1, 8, 659070) When placed in such a position he requested friends to excuse his inability to comply with their requests for attending the meeting.
('88', 419, 1, 9, 659203) He would strongly urge upon those who came to attend the prayer to learn the virtue of self control and develop it in their lives.
('88', 419, 2, 10, 659334) During his stay in Calcutta, concluded Gandhiji, he would try to explain the social and other important aspects of self control and prayer.

('88', 419, 6, 14, 659572) BHAGAWATI, I have your letter.
('88', 419, 6, 15, 659603) How will the marriage be performed at Gondia?
('88', 419, 6, 16, 659649) Will there be some rites or will it take place before the magistrate?
('88', 419, 6, 17, 659719) You have not made it clear.
('88', 419, 6, 18, 659747) I, of course, wish you both well.
('88', 419, 6, 19, 659781) I can never have any objection to such marriages if they are not for mindless indulgence but for exercising restraint, for expanding the field of service and enhancing the spirit of service.
('88', 419, 6, 20, 659972) Actually, I can even encourage such marriages.
('88', 419, 6, 21, 660019) That is why I wish to have a reply to the above question.
('88', 419, 6, 22, 660077) What is the girl’s brother doing?
('88', 419, 6, 23, 660111) Why does the girl not write to me?

('88', 419, 10, 31, 660441) One of your notes is kept in my files so that whenever I get the time I can go through it and return it to you.
('88', 419, 10, 32, 660553) The other one I have already read but I don’t know where it is now.
('88', 419, 10, 33, 660621) It is not lost.
('88', 419, 10, 34, 660637) But I agree it should reach you at the earliest.

('88', 420, 1, 4, 660943) I have had a talk with him.
('88', 420, 1, 5, 660971) I now have my eye on him.
('88', 420, 1, 6, 660997) I am very keen on engaging him in Dinshaw’s clinic.
('88', 420, 1, 7, 661049) I believe that the experience he will gain there will prove very useful for village work.
('88', 420, 1, 8, 661139) Moreover, since he has to spend some time with me he will certainly be under my supervision from time to time and so I shall myself get better acquainted with him.

('88', 420, 5, 15, 661530) JIVANJI, I got your letter and the cheque.
('88', 420, 5, 16, 661573) It has to be considered whether we should go as far as you suggest regarding the copy right.
('88', 420, 5, 17, 661666) Anybody writing to us for permission and our giving it will mean that we have read the work or got it read by someone and approve.
('88', 420, 5, 18, 661797) In this connection Anand Hingorani had suggested different Boards, so that the Tamil Board would decide about the Tamil translation and the Malayalam Board would advise about the translation in that language.
('88', 420, 5, 19, 662006) There would, thus, be a separate Board for each language.
('88', 420, 5, 20, 662064) We have to consider how far it would be advisable and becoming for us to bother ourselves to that extent.
('88', 420, 5, 21, 662170) There are several translations of Tolstoy’s books in the same language.
('88', 420, 5, 22, 662242) All of them are not up to the mark, and the titles of the books also have been translated differently.
('88', 420, 5, 23, 662345) All of them sell, but the translation which is most faithful to the original, most painstaking and beautiful sells more than the other translations.
('88', 420, 5, 24, 662494) The same has happened in the case of the Bible.
('88', 420, 5, 25, 662542) The authorized version is there but there are many others in the field and their publication is not prohibited.
('88', 420, 5, 26, 662654) Every translation has its own circle of readers.
('88', 420, 5, 27, 662703) You have raised the question of the Autobiography.
('88', 420, 5, 28, 662754) A translation has been brought out by one Tamil publisher and now this
('88', 421, 0, 1, 662825) 422 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('88', 421, 1, 2, 662867) is the second.
('88', 421, 1, 3, 662882) How would we know which of the two is really good?
('88', 421, 1, 4, 662933) Or would it be advisable to stop other translations from being published?
('88', 421, 1, 5, 663007) I do not see much benefit in that.
('88', 421, 1, 6, 663042) Even when we decided to claim copyright, I did not go as far as that.
('88', 421, 1, 7, 663112) This matter cannot be looked at from a purely legal point of view, nor from a purely financial one.
('88', 421, 1, 8, 663212) We should look at it wholly from a moral and practical point of view.
('88', 421, 1, 9, 663282) And looking at it thus I feel that we should permit the person who has written to us to publish the translation.
('88', 421, 1, 10, 663395) I have not replied to him, however.
('88', 421, 1, 11, 663431) Consult all the others and discuss the matter with them and suggest whatever reply you think should be given.
('88', 421, 1, 12, 663541) I will think over it and then send a reply to the man.

('88', 421, 8, 25, 664157) To the extent this communion was achieved the individual man got a fresh lease of spiritual enlightenment to sustain one for the next 24 hours.

('88', 423, 8, 15, 666439) You know perhaps that when I was a prisoner in the Aga Khan Palace in Yeravda the ashes of Mahadev Desai first and then of my wife were buried in your compound.
('88', 423, 8, 16, 666600) The remains were cremated there at the Government’s instance.
('88', 423, 8, 17, 666662) They would not let me cremate them outside at the usual crematorium.

('88', 424, 8, 19, 668052) This will not only cure the chest complaint but I am sure make the whole body perfectly healthy.

('88', 425, 2, 4, 668381) MUNNALAL, I got your two letters.
('88', 425, 2, 5, 668415) If other people’s advice differs from mine, follow mine.
('88', 425, 2, 6, 668472) I assume that you have gone to Poona and am accordingly addressing this letter there.
('88', 425, 2, 7, 668558) Why should you feel concerned over anything that you may hear?
('88', 425, 2, 8, 668621) Remain engrossed in your work and don’t speak except when absolutely necessary.
('88', 425, 2, 9, 668701) You should attend to only three duties there and discharge them to the best of your ability: writing the accounts, doing the marketing and maintaining cleanliness.
('88', 425, 2, 10, 668865) In doing the last you may occasionally have to express your opinion, but in doing the other two things you need speak nothing.
('88', 425, 2, 11, 668992) If you keep up courage and faith, your work is bound to win appreciation.
('88', 425, 2, 12, 669066) But even if it does not, what does it matter?
('88', 425, 2, 13, 669112) Kanchan seems to be keeping good health.
('88', 425, 2, 14, 669153) I get very little time to talk to her.
('88', 425, 2, 15, 669192) She works and remains cheerful.
('88', 425, 2, 16, 669224) I have torn up your letter.

('88', 426, 3, 4, 669800) KRISHNACHANDRA, 1. With regard to Om Prakashji I think there is no need for an M. A. degree.
('88', 426, 3, 5, 669893) Of course he must improve his knowledge of Urdu and achieve proficiency in it.
('88', 426, 3, 6, 669972) But how will a degree help in that?
('88', 426, 3, 7, 670008) If he wishes to go home when his brother sends for him, he can certainly go.
('88', 426, 3, 8, 670085) 2. I had entrusted the sadhu to Aryanayakum’s charge because I felt I should not burden you with the responsibility of a case which needs careful [medical] attention.
('88', 426, 3, 9, 670252) Let him go if he wishes to.
('88', 426, 3, 10, 670280) If he stays he has to abide by all the rules.
('88', 426, 3, 11, 670326) Cleaning of lavatories is the first duty.
('88', 426, 3, 12, 670368) He should not be a burden in any way.
('88', 426, 3, 13, 670406) From what Kanu tells me he seems to be a totally useless man.
('88', 426, 3, 14, 670468) As for new Sevagram only what is deemed proper should be done.
('88', 426, 3, 15, 670531) In this connection, only what Jajuji says should be done.
('88', 426, 3, 16, 670589) Read the letter to Sankaran which is enclosed herewith.
('88', 426, 3, 17, 670645) That includes my reply regarding his sister and his son.
('88', 426, 3, 18, 670702) Any girl who wishes to learn only Hindi can easily learn it on her own.
('88', 426, 3, 19, 670774) But we cannot provide facilities for teaching only Hindi.
('88', 426, 3, 20, 670832) Provision can be made for both the scripts.
('88', 426, 3, 21, 670876) This point is perfectly intelligible.
('88', 426, 3, 22, 670914) Try to convince them by appealing to their reason.
('88', 426, 3, 23, 670965) We may not compel anyone to learn both the scripts, but let us provide facilities for those who wish to learn both the scripts.

('88', 427, 5, 7, 671669) 753. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING 2
('88', 427, 6, 8, 671701) SODEPUR, December 6, 1945
('88', 427, 7, 9, 671727) In his introductory speech Gandhiji referred to the incident which took place at Sodepur Railway Station when one person either in attempting
('88', 427, 8, 10, 671869) to board a running train which was not scheduled to stop at Sodepur or for some such reason was run over and killed.
('88', 427, 9, 11, 671986) They might think that when there were crores of Indians what did it matter if one met with death in such circumstances.
('88', 427, 9, 12, 672106) But that was a totally wrong view.
('88', 427, 9, 13, 672141) And if they allowed themselves to think in that way they would not be able to build up a brotherhood in India and secure her salvation.
('88', 427, 9, 14, 672277) They must instead think that the person who met his death the other day was one of them and must feel sorry for his tragic end.
('88', 427, 10, 15, 672405) Perhaps, said Gandhiji, he himself was partly responsible for his death for the deceased went there either to see him or to attend the prayer.
('88', 427, 10, 16, 672548) The congregation too was partly responsible because after the prayer was over they rushed to the Station, vied with each other to catch the train and thereby created a situation which caused this death.
('88', 427, 10, 17, 672751) They, therefore, should henceforth take the vow with him not to create any such situation in future which might cause the death of a fellow brother.
('88', 427, 11, 18, 672900) All this happened because they were not disciplined.
('88', 427, 11, 19, 672953) The prayer was intended to confer upon man that discipline which he required so urgently.
('88', 427, 11, 20, 673043) If they were mentally disciplined through the practice of prayer they would no more commit the mistake they committed the other day.
('88', 427, 12, 21, 673176) If by prayer they could be mentally disciplined, stated Gandhiji, they would

('88', 428, 1, 2, 673406) attain a state which was nobler and higher than even the salvation of India.
('88', 428, 2, 3, 673483) Perhaps, freedom of India could be maintained with the help of pistols or swords.
('88', 428, 2, 4, 673565) But were those weapons of any value if their votaries were not disciplined?
('88', 428, 2, 5, 673641) Therefore whether a country was wedded to violence or non violence discipline was of paramount importance to all men.
('88', 428, 3, 6, 673759) Without discipline it was difficult to attain swaraj as he had stated two days ago.
('88', 428, 4, 7, 673843) If they practised prayer with all concentration they would find that all their difficulties would smoothen.
('88', 428, 5, 8, 673951) Concluding, Gandhiji referred to an incident in South Africa when a ship came upon a rock and was about to sink.
('88', 428, 5, 9, 674064) Its Captain was a strong willed and disciplined man.
('88', 428, 5, 10, 674117) He preserved the calm of his mind and realized that he could not save all lives.
('88', 428, 5, 11, 674198) He, therefore, secured the safety of as many men as he could and then went down with a hymn to God on his lips alone with the sinking ship.
('88', 428, 5, 12, 674338) If he was not a disciplined man, said Gandhiji, he could not have saved the lives of the many passengers of the ship whom he brought to safety.
('88', 428, 5, 13, 674482) What was, therefore, urgently required of all was discipline and this all men could aquire by actively participating in prayer.

('88', 429, 3, 4, 674706) LORD WAVELL’S VERSION OF HIS TALK WITH GANDHIJI1
('88', 429, 4, 5, 674755) I deplored the recent speeches of Congress leaders and said that the preaching of violence could only lead to violence, especially with the inflammable material in India, of young students and goondas (the Indian equivalent of hooligans); and that fomentation of racial and communal hatred would not produce the atmosphere in which a solution could be produced in next year’s discussions.
('88', 429, 4, 6, 675144) He admitted the violence of Congress speeches and indicated that he was trying to get the tone lowered.
('88', 429, 4, 7, 675248) I said that an agreement of some kind between Hindu and Muslim was necessary, even if it was an agreement to part.
('88', 429, 4, 8, 675363) He said he had always tried for a settlement but was frustrated by the British policy of divide and rule.
('88', 429, 4, 9, 675469) I said this was nonsense, we tried our best to bring them together; that the increase in communal feeling was mainly due to the action of Congress Ministries in 1937 39 which had made Muslims feel they would not get a square deal from Congress and had caused the rise of the Muslim League and the idea of Pakistan.
('88', 429, 4, 10, 675784) He defended the Congress Ministries at some length, and said all Governors had admitted their fairness.
('88', 429, 4, 11, 675888) I said there was no doubt about the psychological effect on the Muslims, whatever the facts may have been; and he admitted this.
('88', 429, 4, 12, 676017) I then said that the British were accustomed to abuse and misrepresentation from Indian Nationalists, but that there was a limit, and that it seemed hardly wise to antagonize us at this moment when we were trying our best to bring about a settlement, and that India after getting her freedom would want Britain’s co operation in defence and in commercial development.
('88', 429, 4, 13, 676385) I added that if any disorder resulted from the hatred now being stirred up, it would of course be my duty to suppress it, and I should do so by all means in my power.
('88', 429, 4, 14, 676552) He assented to this; and then said that India needed no help from Britian in trade or defence.
('88', 429, 4, 15, 676647) She would develop her trade in her own way, and her defence would be the moral force of non violence, which would eventually conquer the world and bring about universal peace.
('88', 429, 4, 16, 676823) I said I did not think either of us would live to see this desirable issue, and that the immediate point was to prevent violence in India during the next year or so.
('88', 429, 4, 17, 676989) We left it at that.
('88', 429, 4, 18, 677009) He was quite friendly though woolly, and seemed in good health.
