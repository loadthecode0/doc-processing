('86', 0, 2, 3, 74) When Dr. Kumarappa has given such an excellent introduction, what more is there for me to say?
('86', 0, 2, 4, 169) But Shri Jhaverbhai’s 2 love would not leave me alone.
('86', 0, 2, 5, 224) For his sake I have gone through the pamphlet from beginning to end.
('86', 0, 2, 6, 293) I was not inclined to argue over technical details.
('86', 0, 2, 7, 345) Dr. Sushila was with me.
('86', 0, 2, 8, 370) I made her read out to me the entire thing.
('86', 0, 2, 9, 414) She made a few suggestions which occurred to her.
('86', 0, 2, 10, 464) Jhaverbhai made the necessary improvements.
('86', 0, 2, 11, 508) This means that this pamphlet hears the stamp of Dr. Sushila and Dr. Manu Trivedi 3. I liked the pamphlet.
('86', 0, 2, 12, 615) Its language is simple and lucid.
('86', 0, 2, 13, 649) I hope that this pamphlet will be read by thousands.

('86', 1, 8, 10, 1780) I entirely agree with you regarding the States.
('86', 1, 8, 11, 1828) As to foreign rule, I could not open the subject with Q.A. Jinnah.
('86', 1, 8, 12, 1895) He has excluded the States from his calculation.
('86', 1, 8, 13, 1944) You have not expected me to give any thought to the rest of your scheme.
('86', 1, 8, 14, 2017) For my opinion is that when the whole of foreign rule goes from the whole of India, then only we shall be free to think with a true sense of responsibility.

('86', 2, 12, 20, 3081) You did well in writing to Kaleswara.
('86', 2, 12, 21, 3119) My visit to Bangalore is not going to come about.

('86', 2, 12, 23, 3239) But you simply reply to them: “His going there unlikely.” 2
('86', 2, 13, 24, 3299) It seems I have forgotten to write about, the teacher student relationship.
('86', 2, 13, 25, 3375) I am not worthy to be anyone’s teacher.
('86', 2, 13, 26, 3415) But if you consider yourself my student and conduct yourself accordingly, how can I stop you from doing so?
('86', 2, 14, 27, 3523) 1 The addressee had asked: “Why is it easier to pick up vice than virtue?

('86', 3, 6, 12, 4105) Had Sushila not seen Dinshaw, I would not have known about his distress.
('86', 3, 6, 13, 4178) In fact there was no cause at all for him to be distressed.
('86', 3, 6, 14, 4238) Nothing had been lost.
('86', 3, 6, 15, 4261) Now you have to give him courage.
('86', 3, 6, 16, 4295) How can you afford to lose heart?

('86', 4, 3, 5, 5081) Here the question is one of principle.
('86', 4, 3, 6, 5120) I am sure that an intellectual can do better than an artisan.
('86', 4, 3, 7, 5182) If he does not, then he cannot become an administrator.
('86', 4, 3, 8, 5238) The entire history of England bears testimony to this.
('86', 4, 3, 9, 5293) But I will not interfere.

('86', 4, 7, 16, 5505) March 5, 1945 Brahmacharya plays an important role in subduing the brute within us.
('86', 4, 7, 17, 5589) This is my definition: Brahmacharya is that path by which we realize the Brahman.
('86', 4, 7, 18, 5671) This path lies in completely controlling the five sense organs, the five moter organs and the eleventh, the mind.
('86', 4, 7, 19, 5785) I have deliberately replied in Hindustani.
('86', 4, 8, 20, 5828) From the Hindi original: G.N. 1322

('86', 5, 2, 3, 6129) March 5, 1945 1
('86', 5, 3, 4, 6145) When asked by the representative of the Orient Press on what he had to say about the recent warning given to local Congress workers by the District Magistrate, Nagpur, 2 Gandhiji said: Congressmen who have associated for the fulfilment of our constructive programme need not be agitated over what local governments say or do.
('86', 5, 3, 5, 6471) Whether their policy is merely local or represents the Centre, they should learn to shed fear.
('86', 5, 3, 6, 6566) The District Magistrate’s strictures if they are properly reported are undoubtedly revealing.
('86', 5, 3, 7, 6660) They need not alarm us.
('86', 5, 4, 8, 6684) In reply to another question as to how without any political action and only by social and economic improvement the country could reach its destined goal as revealed by him in his statement published on 20th February, 3 Gandhiji replied: I must refer you to my statement and you may ask yourself whether, if the programme is universally responded to, it will not lead to swaraj.
('86', 5, 4, 9, 7063) Indeed the Muslim League and even the Government should join in its prosecution if they are honest about independence.
('86', 5, 5, 10, 7182) When asked what he thought about anti Indian propaganda carried on in America by Britishers Gandhiji replied: Anti Indian British propaganda should not matter if we are truthful.

('86', 5, 6, 12, 7384) 1 The Hindu, 6 3 1945, however, reports this under the date March 4, 1945. 2 The Additional District Magistrate, Nagpur, had told Congressmen that activities banned in the name of the Congress could not be carried on in the name of any camouflaged Congress organization.
('86', 5, 6, 13, 7655) He had mentioned such organizations as the Nagpur Provincial Congress Representative Committees,the Political Prisoners’ Aid Committee and Congress Ward Committees and warned that action could be taken against them under the Restrictions and Detention Ordinance.

('86', 6, 12, 19, 8701) Why don’t you explain it to me more clearly?

('86', 7, 2, 3, 9054) March 6, 1945
('86', 7, 3, 4, 9068) MU., Why need you feel embarrassed?
('86', 7, 3, 5, 9104) This problem cannot be solved in that way.
('86', 7, 3, 6, 9147) Ask me any question you wish without the slightest hesitation.
('86', 7, 3, 7, 9210) My statement has undergone some revision and may undergo more.
('86', 7, 3, 8, 9273) I don’t wish to exclude anybody.
('86', 7, 3, 9, 9306) I have mentioned four.
('86', 7, 3, 10, 9329) Perhaps they will say, “We were not objects of your experiment; we slept with you as with a mother.” I would not contradict them.
('86', 7, 3, 11, 9459) It is enough here to mention that such a thing has happened.
('86', 7, 3, 12, 9520) I don’t consider Abha, Kanchan and Vina as part of the experiment.
('86', 7, 3, 13, 9587) If we distinguish between sleeping together and the experiment, the difference between the two in my view is a big one.
('86', 7, 3, 14, 9707) Abha slept with me for hardly three nights.
('86', 7, 3, 15, 9751) Kanchan slept one night only.
('86', 7, 3, 16, 9781) Vina’s sleeping with me might be called an accident.
('86', 7, 3, 17, 9834) All that can be said is that she slept close to me.
('86', 7, 3, 18, 9886) If Abha had continued, her case would have been and altogether different one.
('86', 7, 3, 19, 9964) Kanchan’s case was rather tragic.
('86', 7, 3, 20, 9998) I didn’t understand her at all.
('86', 7, 3, 21, 10030) What Abha or Kanchan told me was this; that she had no intention whatever of observing brahmacharya, butwished to enjoy the pleasure of sex.
('86', 7, 3, 22, 10171) She, therefore, stayed only reluctantly and undressed only for fear of hurting me.
('86', 7, 3, 23, 10254) If I remember rightly, she was not with me even for an hour.
('86', 7, 3, 24, 10315) I then stopped both the women sleeping with me, for I realized that Kanu and you were upset.
('86', 7, 3, 25, 10408) I myself advised them that they should tell you both and also Bhansali.
('86', 7, 3, 26, 10480) You will thus see that these three names cannot be included in the experiment.
('86', 7, 3, 27, 10559) Lilavati, Amtussalaam, Rajkumari and Prabhavati are not here.
('86', 7, 3, 28, 10621) I have deliberately included Pra.
('86', 7, 3, 29, 10655) in the experiment.
('86', 7, 3, 30, 10674) Maybe I should not.
('86', 7, 3, 31, 10694) She often used to sleep with me to keep me warm even before I was conscious that I was making an experiment.
('86', 7, 3, 32, 10803) I used to draw her to me when she lay on the floor, shivering, for my sake.
('86', 7, 3, 33, 10879) This is an old, old story.
('86', 7, 3, 34, 10906) I think I have now told you everything.
('86', 7, 3, 35, 10946) If you have any more questions, you may ask me.
('86', 7, 3, 36, 10994) Kanchan’s labouring under a misunderstanding pained me, but I was helpless.
('86', 7, 3, 37, 11070) I formed no judgment regarding Sushila and you.
('86', 7, 3, 38, 11118) I did not get sufficient material, for doing that either.
('86', 7, 3, 39, 11176) If she herself wishes and you too wish it, I would spare some time and hear you both.
('86', 7, 3, 40, 11262) I will examine witnesses and try to weigh the evidence.
('86', 7, 3, 41, 11318) But let me repeat that if you

('86', 8, 1, 2, 11387) two feel as brother and sister to each other, you should not ask even your father to examine you and pronounce judgment.
('86', 8, 1, 3, 11508) But do as you wish.
('86', 8, 1, 4, 11528) I understand about a separate kitchen.
('86', 8, 1, 5, 11567) I shall try.
('86', 8, 1, 6, 11580) Will the purchase of provisions for the hospital and the Ashram kitchens be under one account or two?
('86', 8, 1, 7, 11682) I see that a catering service can be run only if it is managed by a third party.
('86', 8, 1, 8, 11763) I think this is enough for today.
('86', 8, 1, 9, 11797) About the third party and going to villages, etc., later on.
('86', 8, 1, 10, 11858) I have not revised this.

('86', 8, 6, 20, 12250) Remember we have decided that we shall strive to become one nation but the movement for swaraj cannot remain in abeyance till we have succeeded in that.
('86', 8, 6, 21, 12403) The question of language should be removed from that area.
('86', 8, 6, 22, 12462) It is true that greater unity will be achieved if the two forms are combined.

('86', 9, 2, 3, 12808) March 6, 1945 You have raised a pertinent question.
('86', 9, 2, 4, 12860) I am dealing with it patiently.
('86', 9, 2, 5, 12892) Asha Devi, Aryanayakum, etc., are looking after this.

('86', 9, 5, 9, 13037) 19. NOTE TO MUNNALAL G. SHAH 1
('86', 9, 6, 10, 13068) March 6, 1945 This discussion is somewhat out of place because at present nothing is happening.
('86', 9, 6, 11, 13164) For this too friends are responsible.
('86', 9, 6, 12, 13202) I have gone as far as I could to satisfy them.
('86', 9, 6, 13, 13249) It will not be proper for me to do anything until I have satisfied my co workers.
('86', 9, 6, 14, 13331) I am as much against compromise as I am for it.
('86', 9, 6, 15, 13379) For this very reason my elder brother remained my enemy for 13 years.
('86', 9, 6, 16, 13449) He asked my forgiveness five or six months before his death.
('86', 9, 6, 17, 13510) My caste also became my enemy in the same manner.
('86', 9, 6, 18, 13560) Now it does not show any feeling of animosity.
('86', 9, 6, 19, 13607) But quite a few sanatanists are still opposed to me.
('86', 9, 6, 20, 13660) On this account I let myself be deprived of lakhs of rupees.
('86', 9, 6, 21, 13721) I used to be a friend of the Empire.
('86', 9, 6, 22, 13758) Today I have become its enemy.
('86', 9, 6, 23, 13789) What more need I say?
('86', 9, 6, 24, 13811) I showed the door to a wife like Ba.
('86', 9, 6, 25, 13848) Thus, I am what I am.
('86', 9, 6, 26, 13870) There is therefore no point in talking about the welfare of society.
('86', 9, 6, 27, 13939) What else may I give up?
('86', 9, 6, 28, 13964) I cannot give up thinking.
('86', 9, 6, 29, 13991) As far as possible I have postponed the practice of sleeping together.
('86', 9, 6, 30, 14062) But it cannot be given up altogether.
('86', 9, 6, 31, 14100) You can say that ever since I went to England I have been pursuing the idea of brahmacharya.
('86', 9, 6, 32, 14193) It has not harmed anyone.
('86', 9, 6, 33, 14219) It is true of course that I should do what others too can be permitted to do.
('86', 9, 6, 34, 14297) If I can restrain myself and sleep beside a woman, others can also do so on the same condition.
('86', 9, 6, 35, 14393) They can fulfil that condition if they so wish.
('86', 9, 6, 36, 14441) The same applies to non violence.
('86', 9, 6, 37, 14475) If I completely give up sleeping together, my brahmacharya will be put to shame.
('86', 9, 6, 38, 14556) It is not that I would do anything for the mere pleasure of it.
('86', 9, 6, 39, 14620) I have not done it

('86', 10, 1, 2, 14754) for years, and I shall not do it now.
('86', 10, 1, 3, 14792) It is true that people may indulge in licentiousness by imitating me.
('86', 10, 1, 4, 14862) Who can stop it?
('86', 10, 1, 5, 14879) Is there any place where asatyagraha 1 has never been practised in the name of satyagraha?
('86', 10, 1, 6, 14970) In any case, the thing has been postponed because it calls for consideration.
('86', 10, 1, 7, 15048) But since there is need for a halt let it be so.
('86', 10, 1, 8, 15097) You can ask any questions.
('86', 10, 1, 9, 15124) I suggest that you should not ask questions individually.You may all discuss it among yourselves and then ask questions.
('86', 10, 1, 10, 15245) Let it be understood that right now everything is postponed.
('86', 10, 1, 11, 15306) Manu has been left alone by the others.
('86', 10, 1, 12, 15346) Hence there is scope for a mature deliberation.
('86', 10, 1, 13, 15394) I claim that whatever I have done I have done in the name of God.
('86', 10, 1, 14, 15460) I go to bed reciting His name.
('86', 10, 1, 15, 15491) I have got up with His name on my lips.
('86', 10, 1, 16, 15531) So it is in my dreams, whether alone or with some woman.
('86', 10, 1, 17, 15588) What God will make me do in days to come He alone knows.
('86', 10, 1, 18, 15645) Such restrictions should not be imosed on me.
('86', 10, 1, 19, 15691) Kishorelalbhai’s business should be left to him.
('86', 10, 1, 20, 15740) Do not drag him into this matter.
('86', 10, 1, 21, 15774) My advice is that everybody should join hands and stand by him.
('86', 10, 1, 22, 15838) There is no need to plead his case before me.
('86', 10, 1, 23, 15884) I am glad that I have answered your question but I am not in a position to listen.
('86', 10, 1, 24, 15967) I have said that right now everything stands postponed, leaving aside Manu.
('86', 10, 1, 25, 16043) But Kishorelal is not satisfied with this.
('86', 10, 1, 26, 16086) It is your duty to understand him.
('86', 10, 1, 27, 16121) He is right when he says: “I was not consulted at first.
('86', 10, 1, 28, 16178) Now I shall not create any confusion.” In the present situation whoever has any doubt in his mind should follow him.
('86', 10, 1, 29, 16295) I would in any case do that.
('86', 10, 1, 30, 16324) I would not create difficulties for him.
('86', 10, 1, 31, 16365) You should consider his delicate health when you bother him.
('86', 10, 1, 32, 16426) If you do this you will be serving him, no doubt, but you will also be serving me.
('86', 10, 1, 33, 16509) My love for him is certainly no less than my love for my brother.
('86', 10, 1, 34, 16575) What more can I do?

('86', 11, 0, 1, 16940) 12 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('86', 11, 1, 2, 16981) serious worker who can affect the politics of his country and even the world affairs.
('86', 11, 1, 3, 17067) To such my advice is that he must read the originals.
('86', 11, 1, 4, 17121) The introduction may be used as such and as an aid to memory.
('86', 11, 1, 5, 17183) I want the readers I have in view to take me at my word.
('86', 11, 1, 6, 17240) I have written as I felt at the moment as a seeker of long standing of Truth and Non violence.
('86', 11, 1, 7, 17335) I have written without reservation and without embellishment.
('86', 11, 1, 8, 17397) After my accidentally premature discharge from detention 1 and convalescence I studied from reliable witnesses the happenings of the two years after the incarceration of principal Congressmen and myself.
('86', 11, 1, 9, 17601) I have heard nothing to modify the opinion expressed in my writings under review.
('86', 11, 1, 10, 17683) I know first hand what has happened, since my discharge, in the various spheres of life.
('86', 11, 1, 11, 17772) And I have found bitter confirmation of what I have said in the following pages.
('86', 11, 1, 12, 17853) Indeed, the whole of India is a vast prison.
('86', 11, 1, 13, 17898) The Viceroy is the irresponsible superintendent of the prison with numerous jailers and warders under him.
('86', 11, 1, 14, 18005) The four hundred millions of India are not the only prisoners.
('86', 11, 1, 15, 18068) There are others similarly situated in the other parts of the earth under other superintendents.
('86', 11, 1, 16, 18165) A jailer is as much a prisoner as his prisoner.
('86', 11, 1, 17, 18213) There is no doubt a difference.
('86', 11, 1, 18, 18245) From my point of view he is worse.
('86', 11, 1, 19, 18280) If there is a Day of Judgment, i.e., if there is a Judge whom we do not see but who nevertheless is much more truly than we exist for a brief moment, the judgment will go hard against the Jailer and in favour of the prisoners.
('86', 11, 1, 20, 18507) India is the only place on earth which knowingly has chosen Truth and Non violence as the only means for her deliverance.
('86', 11, 1, 21, 18629) But deliverance to be obtained through these means must be deliverance for the whole world including the jailers otherwise described by me as tyrants and imperialists.
('86', 11, 1, 22, 18797) I need not mention Fascists or Nazis or Japanese.
('86', 11, 1, 23, 18847) They seem to be as good as gone.
('86', 11, 1, 24, 18880) The war will end this year or the next.
('86', 11, 1, 25, 18920) It will bring victory to the Allies.
('86', 11, 1, 26, 18957) The pity of it is that it will be only so called if it is attained with India and the like lying prostrate at the feet of the Allies.
('86', 11, 1, 27, 19091) That victory will be assuredly a prelude to a deadlier war, if anything could be more deadly.
('86', 11, 1, 28, 19185) I know that I do not need to plead for non violent India.
('86', 11, 1, 29, 19243) If India has the coin with Truth on one face and Non violence on the
('86', 11, 2, 30, 19312) 1 On May 6, 1944
('86', 12, 0, 1, 19329) VOL. 86 : 4 MARCH, 1945 28 MAY, 1945 13
('86', 12, 1, 2, 19369) other, the coin has its own inestimable value which will speak for itself.
('86', 12, 1, 3, 19444) Truth and Non violence must express humility at every step.
('86', 12, 1, 4, 19504) They do not disdain real aid from any quarter, much less from those in whose name and for whom exploitation is practised.
('86', 12, 1, 5, 19626) If the British and the Allies aid, so much the better.
('86', 12, 1, 6, 19681) Deliverance will then come sooner.
('86', 12, 1, 7, 19716) If they do not, deliverance is still certain.
('86', 12, 1, 8, 19762) Only the agony of the victim will be greater, the time longer.
('86', 12, 1, 9, 19825) But what are agony and time if theyare spent in favour of liberty, especially when it is to be brought about through Truth and Non violence!

('86', 12, 5, 15, 20205) He easily finds use for this increased knowledge in disseminating it.
('86', 12, 5, 16, 20275) He thinks in his own language or the national language, so that his ideas are understood by thousands with the utmost ease.
('86', 12, 5, 17, 20399) If he carries on in this manner, the knowledge he has gained will soon become common possession.
('86', 12, 5, 18, 20496) Bhai Jhaverbhai has written a beautiful essay and given information about food, etc., in simple language.
('86', 12, 5, 19, 20602) I hope that the knowledge will be widely used and the suggestions made in the essay implemented.

('86', 17, 3, 4, 25892) KRISHNACHANDRA, There is no discourtesy in your question.
('86', 17, 3, 5, 25950) Your question shows how imperfect a medium language is.
('86', 17, 3, 6, 26006) If I stop sleeping together for all time it will mean that I have been mistaken.
('86', 17, 3, 7, 26087) Otherwise why should I stop it?
('86', 17, 3, 8, 26119) There is a limit toabstaining from it for the sake of friends.
('86', 17, 3, 9, 26182) Sleeping together came with my taking up of brahmacharya or even before that.
('86', 17, 3, 10, 26260) Can you understand it now?
('86', 17, 3, 11, 26287) The dangers you have pointed out are certainly there.
('86', 17, 3, 12, 26341) But for that reason, a good act should not be avoided.
('86', 17, 3, 13, 26396) Only we should be vigilant.
('86', 17, 3, 14, 26424) The experiment is not meant to be imitated.
('86', 17, 3, 15, 26468) But if I can become a perfect brahmachari thereby, would I not be able to contribute more to the welfare of the world?
('86', 17, 3, 16, 26587) Even if there is a single person who can train himself that way, he should do it.
('86', 17, 3, 17, 26669) I was not out for an experiment, but when the situation presented itself before me I did what I felt was necessary.

('86', 25, 2, 3, 34824) SEVAGRAM, March 9, 1945 2
('86', 25, 3, 4, 34850) (1) Q. At present there are only provincial Congress organizations functioning.
('86', 25, 3, 5, 34930) Is it not essential to have an all India Congress organization to enunciate a common policy and common programme?
('86', 25, 4, 6, 35044) A. A common all India Congress organization is an impossibility while the President and other members of the Working Committee are in detention.
('86', 25, 5, 7, 35189) (2) Q. What is the definition of a kisan?
('86', 25, 5, 8, 35231) We hope that you agree that we can have an independent Andhra Provincial Kisan Congress as a part of and under the discipline of the Andhra Province Congress Assembly [sic]?
('86', 25, 6, 9, 35405) A. For me a kisan is one who actually works on land belonging to himself or another.
('86', 25, 6, 10, 35490) In every case, I have pointed the way of relief.
('86', 25, 6, 11, 35539) You should read what I have written.
('86', 25, 6, 12, 35576) 3 Local difficulties should be solved locally.
('86', 25, 6, 13, 35623) For the right answer, accurate knowledge of local conditions is necessary.
('86', 25, 6, 14, 35698) I lack this.
('86', 25, 6, 15, 35711) Hence my answer may even mislead.
('86', 25, 6, 16, 35745) All organizations may be independent and yet a part of the Congress and subject to its discipline.
('86', 25, 7, 17, 35844) (3) Q. We think it is better to have for the Kisan Congress also a tricoloured national flag without any additional class emblem.
('86', 25, 8, 18, 35974) A. I had full discussion with Prof.
('86', 25, 8, 19, 36010) 4 I agree generally about the points you have raised.
('86', 25, 9, 20, 36064) (4) Q. There are many kisans in villages who have helped in war efforts under the official influence.
('86', 25, 9, 21, 36166) They are not entitled to be members of the Congress organizations at present.
('86', 25, 9, 22, 36244) But they are, all the same, sympathizers of the National Congress.
('86', 25, 9, 23, 36311) Shall we bring them into Kisan Congress?
('86', 25, 9, 24, 36352) Both classes of members can have equal voice in the matter of redress against the landlords and the Government.
('86', 25, 9, 25, 36464) But the first class of members only should decide all questions of a political nature.
('86', 25, 10, 26, 36551) A. Those who are real sympathizers will remain so even if for

('86', 26, 2, 4, 37044) The Deputation asked Gandhiji whether Congress could see local officials in grave and emergent cases of food and other economic difficulties of people for immediate redress and Gandhiji replied that it was not an absolute evil to see officials but there should be no seeing to flatter or please them.
('86', 26, 3, 5, 37345) Asked as to whether Congress bodies could apply to officials for permission to hold public meetings, processions or training camps, in any district where prohibitory order by the District Magistrate is in force, Gandhiji replied that no such permission should be applied for.
('86', 26, 4, 6, 37621) Winding up the discussion, Mahatmaji said that generally while he made himself available to all friends, they should try to act on their own even though they may make mistakes.

('86', 32, 13, 21, 43539) SEVAGRAM, March 11, 1945 A conference of Congress workers, limited in number and by special invitation, was recently banned in Akola by the District Magistrate.
('86', 32, 13, 22, 43700) The order is reported to say that “discussion will take
('86', 32, 14, 23, 43756) 1 Raja Narendranath, addressee’s father, died on March 10.
('86', 33, 0, 1, 43815) 34 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('86', 33, 1, 2, 43856) place among other subjects on the work and programme of the Congress, particularly in villages”.
('86', 33, 1, 3, 43953) Considering the influence of the invitees, he was of the opinion that this conference would “hamper the successful prosecution of the war”.
('86', 33, 1, 4, 44093) It passes comprehension how a conference, where only discussion could take place, can hamper the prosecution of the war or how the constructive programme, no matter how influentially worked, can hamper the prosecution of the war.
('86', 33, 1, 5, 44323) Does the Magistrate say one thing and mean something else when he says that a successful working of the constructive programme can and will make the present war with the Japanese impossible?
('86', 33, 1, 6, 44514) This may need proof, but no proof is needed to show that the constructive work cannot and is not designed to hamper in any way whatsoever the prosecution of the war.
('86', 33, 1, 7, 44680) What it can do is to bring work and bread to villagers in their own homes, besides making illiterates literate and happy.
('86', 33, 1, 8, 44802) Or does Government, if the order is prompted by them, want to prevent influential Congressmen from serving the people in any way whatsoever?
('86', 33, 1, 9, 44943) If so, why have they released Congressmen at all?
('86', 33, 1, 10, 44993) Anyway Congressmen whose only calling is service of the people will serve mutely and without caring for the consequences that may befall them by reason of their service.
('86', 33, 1, 11, 45163) That is the true meaning of do or die.

('86', 34, 2, 6, 46052) Almost all of them would strip reluctantly.
('86', 34, 2, 7, 46096) I have written—haven’t I?— that they did so at my prompting.

('86', 35, 7, 9, 47042) MUNNALAL, I am a little tired now of talking about myself.
('86', 35, 7, 10, 47101) I have said much, I shall say more.
('86', 35, 7, 11, 47137) But not in this manner.
('86', 35, 7, 12, 47161) I do not wish to publicize Kanchan’s name.
('86', 35, 7, 13, 47204) Even you do not have the right to do so.
('86', 35, 7, 14, 47245) You are not Kanchan’s owner, as she is not yours.
('86', 35, 7, 15, 47295) But after all these years I have not been able to make you understand this.
('86', 35, 7, 16, 47371) I read your letter regarding Sushilabehn.
('86', 35, 7, 17, 47413) If you say that both of you lost patience and swerved from the path, then that should be enough.
('86', 35, 7, 18, 47510) You need no one else’s opinion.
('86', 35, 7, 19, 47542) I therefore advise you to forget the incident.
('86', 35, 7, 20, 47589) If Sushila should say that she had not swerved, I should have to hear her but it would serve no useful purpose.
('86', 35, 7, 21, 47701) If, nevertheless, you insist on an impartial judgment, I am ready to hand over all the papers to Narahari.
('86', 35, 7, 22, 47808) Let him go through them and give his verdict.
('86', 35, 7, 23, 47854) Is not your advice to me futile?
('86', 35, 7, 24, 47887) In practice there is nothing now.
('86', 35, 7, 25, 47921) As for the thought, how can I change it so long as I feel that it is pure?

('86', 37, 2, 3, 49540) MUNNALAL, I can find the time, but it seems pointless.
('86', 37, 2, 4, 49595) Since you want it I give my decision.
('86', 37, 2, 5, 49633) Both of you are hasty.
('86', 37, 2, 6, 49656) Both of you first say whatever occurs to you and think afterwards.
('86', 37, 2, 7, 49723) If Sushila had not intervened that evening, the outcome would have been quite different.
('86', 37, 2, 8, 49812) But she is unable to restrain herself.
('86', 37, 2, 9, 49851) Moreover, she believes she cannot hurt you since you are more than a brother to her.
('86', 37, 2, 10, 49936) There is nothing more left for me to say.
('86', 37, 2, 11, 49978) What has happened has happened.
('86', 37, 2, 12, 50010) Sushila could not have removed Chand to quarters reserved for other people, and she assumed that since she had come with a suggestion about the sick, you would readily offer your room.
('86', 37, 2, 13, 50195) The thing is we ought to have special facilities for the sick, which we have not provided.
('86', 37, 2, 14, 50286) It will be enough if we take a lesson for the future from this incident.
('86', 37, 2, 15, 50359) Say to yourself again and again: “Think before you speak.” As far as possible one must cultivate silence.
('86', 37, 2, 16, 50465) And even if we have to work very hard for it, we must have a separate room for the sick.
('86', 37, 2, 17, 50554) Like a fire bucket, it must not be put to any other use.
('86', 37, 2, 18, 50611) Sushila’s statement is attached, as also yours.
('86', 37, 2, 19, 50659) I have not shown her this letter, nor your statement.

('86', 37, 4, 24, 50958) If we have one, we must put up with a good many things.
('86', 37, 4, 25, 51014) Shushila cannot see any other point of view, but ignore that.
('86', 37, 4, 26, 51076) You should endure.
('86', 37, 4, 27, 51095) what you can easily endure and leave what you cannot.
('86', 37, 4, 28, 51149) It is a condition for apeaceful life.
('86', 37, 4, 29, 51187) Gita which at one place says “what then will restraint avail” 1 teaches restraint elsewhere.

('86', 57, 8, 18, 71639) Write a sweet letter to Totaramji.
('86', 57, 8, 19, 71674) I see no need of your going there.
('86', 57, 8, 20, 71709) The same goes for Surendraji.
('86', 57, 8, 21, 71739) But you may go to your own village.
('86', 57, 8, 22, 71775) Or, to Mirabehn or perhaps to Manzar Ali.
('86', 57, 8, 23, 71817) In any of these three places you will do at least something.
('86', 57, 8, 24, 71878) Yes, Bengal is a vast field for your goseva work.
('86', 57, 8, 25, 71928) But now that is out.
('86', 57, 8, 26, 71949) Now about Sevagram.
('86', 57, 8, 27, 71969) It is my belief that Sevagram will never break up.
('86', 57, 8, 28, 72020) It may undergo transformation, as was the case with Sabarmati.
('86', 57, 8, 29, 72083) As long as I am alive and active, there will not be much change at Sevagram.
('86', 57, 8, 30, 72160) I do not wish to make any.
('86', 57, 8, 31, 72187) If I survive, a new order will come in course of time.
('86', 57, 8, 32, 72242) Those who are attached to Sevagram will not give it up for good either now or after I am gone.
('86', 57, 8, 33, 72337) Who can say that after I am dead even Vinoba may not possibly make the place his own?
('86', 57, 8, 34, 72423) If he survives me, his loyalty and his non violence will not permit him to leave Sevagram.
('86', 57, 8, 35, 72514) I am sure that even though all the organizations are independent, they are unknowingly dependent on Sevagram.
('86', 57, 8, 36, 72624) This is just as well.

('86', 58, 1, 4, 72857) At least you have not been taken away from the cow?
('86', 58, 1, 5, 72909) What does it matter if today you and Munnalal do not feel one as before?
('86', 58, 1, 6, 72982) I am not saying all this in order to make you change your mind.
('86', 58, 1, 7, 73046) My advice to you stays.
('86', 58, 1, 8, 73070) Go where I have suggested.

('86', 58, 6, 18, 73481) That alone will please me.

('86', 61, 7, 18, 76625) I put my idea of education into practice in my own case.
('86', 61, 7, 19, 76682) My fast—it could not really be called a fast because I took fruit juice—was purely physical.
('86', 61, 7, 20, 76775) I did not find it unbearable.
('86', 61, 7, 21, 76805) I did not agree to take glucose and so had the feeling of fasting.
('86', 61, 7, 22, 76872) But that was only for a short time, as later on I had to take glucose.
('86', 61, 7, 23, 76943) I can tell you more but this should suffice.
('86', 61, 7, 24, 76988) Bear in mind that I take all possible care of myself.
('86', 61, 7, 25, 77042) I hope Kanam is well.
('86', 61, 7, 26, 77064) He wrote to me that he would be coming to Bombay but would be able to do so only after hisexaminations.
('86', 61, 7, 27, 77168) I do not know whether I shall be there then.
('86', 61, 7, 28, 77213) We shall see.

('86', 62, 3, 4, 77541) KRISHNACHANDRA, Has it not been proved that in your case proximity to me does not help in observing brahmacharya?
('86', 62, 3, 5, 77655) Otherwise, after so many years, your brahmacharya should have been perfect.
('86', 62, 3, 6, 77731) It is necessary for the sake of brahmacharya that one should engage oneself in ennobling work.
('86', 62, 3, 7, 77826) Nayee Talim is one such work and when children are there what more can you ask?
('86', 62, 3, 8, 77906) If you stay with the children instead of being here, you will not lose contact with me and you will be kept away from idle talk.

('86', 62, 8, 13, 78151) KRISHNACHANDRA, Your long letter betrays your state of mind.
('86', 62, 8, 14, 78212) Is it not right that I should write to you taking what you say to be the complete truth?
('86', 62, 8, 15, 78301) The others who are here do not feel very intensely about brahmacharya.
('86', 62, 8, 16, 78372) You do and so I write about it.
('86', 62, 8, 17, 78404) But in the end you must do as you feel.
('86', 62, 8, 18, 78444) If you do something I say without your heart being in it, you may take it that it will be futile.
('86', 62, 8, 19, 78542) It will be no good at all if you mechanically do what I say.
('86', 62, 8, 20, 78603) What you have written is of course true.
('86', 62, 8, 21, 78644) What does it matter?
('86', 62, 8, 22, 78665) I do consult people after all.
('86', 62, 8, 23, 78696) What is the harmeven if the boys leave?
('86', 62, 8, 24, 78736) There is a lot of work to do.
('86', 62, 8, 25, 78766) After all our principle is just this: whoever is available is fit to be taught and fit also to teach.

('86', 63, 8, 16, 79472) She is doing as much as she can.
('86', 63, 8, 17, 79505) The course is not easy.
('86', 63, 8, 18, 79529) The votaries of Ayurved have to cut a path for themselves.

('86', 63, 8, 20, 79649) I have not come across a single vaidya who would sacrifice everything for this work.
('86', 63, 8, 21, 79734) I am not worried that there are too many doctors on the committees.
('86', 63, 8, 22, 79802) When the need arises we can have vaidyas on every committee.
('86', 63, 8, 23, 79863) I shall never let a good suggestion pass.
('86', 63, 8, 24, 79905) But what am I to do if I do not come across any.
('86', 63, 8, 25, 79954) Do as much as you can.

('86', 64, 3, 12, 80710) It is my belief that if everybody had followed that programme we should have won freedom by now.

('86', 71, 13, 17, 87758) MY DEAR URMILA 2, I hope you got my wire in Reply [to] your first letter.
('86', 71, 13, 18, 87832) Now I have your second letter.
('86', 71, 13, 19, 87863) I have seen Dr. Mitra’s scheme.
('86', 71, 13, 20, 87895) I have written to him and also Profulla about it.
('86', 71, 13, 21, 87945) 3 Dr. Mitra has to revise his scheme in terms of the villages whom he must see in their dangers [sic] before he can write anything useful.
('86', 71, 13, 22, 88084) As for yourself, you need not worry.
('86', 71, 13, 23, 88121) The first thing is for you to be fit for nursing.
('86', 71, 13, 24, 88171) Will you ever be?
('86', 71, 13, 25, 88189) Mere wish is of little use.
('86', 71, 14, 26, 88217) 1 The addressee had wired: “Fever left but cough still persisting.
('86', 71, 14, 27, 88284) Am taking toast, vegetable and milk no butter.

('86', 72, 5, 8, 88746) March 20, 1945
('86', 72, 6, 9, 88761) MUNNALAL, I have read all that you have written.
('86', 72, 6, 10, 88810) Give up the notion that I have no trust in you.
('86', 72, 6, 11, 88858) That you are unmethodical is shown by your writing and your behaviour.
('86', 72, 6, 12, 88929) What can you do about it?
('86', 72, 6, 13, 88955) First the realization, then the endeavour, then the time.
('86', 72, 6, 14, 89013) That is the order.
('86', 72, 6, 15, 89032) I do wish that there should be a separate kitchen.
('86', 72, 6, 16, 89083) I am considering what to do now.
('86', 72, 6, 17, 89116) I will write nothing now about Sushila.
('86', 72, 6, 18, 89156) There was no question of my selecting anybody for my office.
('86', 72, 6, 19, 89217) I employ in it only those whom I cannot fix up anywhere else.
('86', 72, 6, 20, 89279) Others who joined did so by accident.
('86', 72, 6, 21, 89317) If I had to start a new office altogether, I should know very well how to do it.
('86', 72, 6, 22, 89398) You do not know with what type of persons I have run an office in the most difficult circumstances.
('86', 72, 6, 23, 89498) But can I not run the Ashram also in that manner?
('86', 72, 6, 24, 89548) Why did I not appoint Vinoba to run the office?
('86', 72, 6, 25, 89596) You should be able to draw the appropriate conclusions from this.
('86', 72, 6, 26, 89662) If when I have some free time you ask me for work, I will tell you.
('86', 72, 6, 27, 89730) Do you really feel like doing some work in the office?
('86', 72, 6, 28, 89785) Personally I should like to return from Bombay in about four days’ time.
('86', 72, 6, 29, 89858) But I shall be in the doctors’ hands.
('86', 72, 6, 30, 89896) Maybe I shall have to go to Panchgani if they insist.
('86', 72, 6, 31, 89950) I don’t know.
('86', 72, 6, 32, 89964) We shall see what happens.
('86', 72, 6, 33, 89991) I do not say, or wish, that you should go to Kanchan.
('86', 72, 6, 34, 90045) But if she or you feel such a desire, I would encourage you.
('86', 72, 6, 35, 90106) If you tell me your
('86', 73, 0, 1, 90126) 74 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('86', 73, 1, 2, 90167) reasons for not going, or write them down, I might consider.
('86', 73, 1, 3, 90228) I have to be away for two months.
('86', 73, 1, 4, 90262) In that time there is a chance that the kitchenarrangements may improve.
('86', 73, 1, 5, 90335) I am not satisfied with this letter.
('86', 73, 1, 6, 90372) The circumstances themselves are unsatisfactory.
('86', 73, 1, 7, 90421) Whom can we blame for that?

('86', 73, 5, 14, 90689) Kanchan’s postcard to Munnalal came today.
('86', 73, 5, 15, 90732) I see from it that she is very ill.
('86', 73, 5, 16, 90768) I am asking Munnalal to go there.
('86', 73, 5, 17, 90802) Let us see what happens.
('86', 73, 5, 18, 90827) I am all right.
('86', 73, 5, 19, 90843) I am working regularly.
('86', 73, 5, 20, 90867) I shall have to go to Bombay towards the end of this month.
('86', 73, 5, 21, 90927) I am not writing separately to Kanchan.

('86', 73, 8, 25, 91138) It seems to me that you should go to your village.
('86', 73, 8, 26, 91189) Go to Mirabehn and also to Dharmadev Shastri.
('86', 73, 8, 27, 91235) Staying away at this time can only do you good.
('86', 73, 8, 28, 91283) No doubt the Ashram remains full because of me, but it has proved its independent existence during my absence, be it here, at Sabarmati, at Kochrab or at Phoenix.
('86', 73, 8, 29, 91446) The Autobiography gives the story up to Sabarmati.
('86', 73, 8, 30, 91497) It is astonishing.
('86', 73, 8, 31, 91516) Ask somebody or ask me.
('86', 73, 8, 32, 91540) It is good to learn veterinary science.

('86', 74, 2, 3, 91822) SEVAGRAM, March 20, 1945
('86', 74, 3, 4, 91847) GHANSHYAMDAS, I have sent you an express telegram 1, a copy of which is enclosed.
('86', 74, 3, 5, 91929) What are you taking, how much and when?
('86', 74, 3, 6, 91969) What leafy vegetables are you taking, and are you taking them raw or boiled?
('86', 74, 3, 7, 92046) You do not throw away the water, do you?
('86', 74, 3, 8, 92087) Will not khakhara 2 be better than toast?
('86', 74, 3, 9, 92129) Does the Hour include the bran?
('86', 74, 3, 10, 92161) If you are taking milk, how much?
('86', 74, 3, 11, 92195) Whatever happens you must take half an ounce of butter well spread over the toast or khakhara, together with the salad.
('86', 74, 3, 12, 92315) If you have indigestion, reduce other things, but continue the butter.
('86', 74, 3, 13, 92386) Deep breathing is essential.
('86', 74, 3, 14, 92415) Close one nostril and breathe deeply through the other.
('86', 74, 3, 15, 92471) You can gradually increase it to half an hour.
('86', 74, 3, 16, 92518) Utter Ramanama with every breath you take.
('86', 74, 3, 17, 92561) When doing breathing exercises, you should have fresh air on all sides.
('86', 74, 3, 18, 92633) It would be better to do it in the open.
('86', 74, 3, 19, 92674) You should do it every morning without fail and afterwards at least four times after the food has been digested.
('86', 74, 3, 20, 92787) Breathe in and breathe out.
('86', 74, 3, 21, 92815) This exercise should be taken slowly.
('86', 74, 3, 22, 92853) Do your bowels move properly?
('86', 74, 3, 23, 92883) Are you able to sleep?
('86', 74, 3, 24, 92906) If you do all this carefully you will soon get rid of the cough.

('86', 74, 8, 31, 93162) It is good that you are in Harijan Nivas.
('86', 74, 8, 32, 93204) You must get well.
('86', 74, 8, 33, 93223) Chand is somewhat agitated.

('86', 75, 1, 3, 93478) If you need Chand’s services, I will send her immediately.
('86', 75, 1, 4, 93537) She is learning to nurse the sick here.
('86', 75, 1, 5, 93577) But nursing you will be the proper training.
('86', 75, 1, 6, 93622) However, if you do not need Chand’s services, then I do not see any point in sending her merely so that you can look at each other.
('86', 75, 1, 7, 93754) Let me know your mind.
('86', 75, 1, 8, 93777) Khurshedbehn left a few days ago.

('86', 75, 6, 18, 94140) Spinning means picking the cotton bolls from the field, separating the seeds with a rolling pin, ginning the cotton, making the slivers, spinning the yarn of the required count and doubling it.
('86', 75, 7, 19, 94334) It was good as it was.
('86', 75, 7, 20, 94357) But since I was asked I have put down my ideas.

('86', 76, 12, 17, 95223) [Q.] Mr. Amery 4 told Karaka, Bombay Chronicle’s war correspondent, in the course of an interview, that you could give a lead.
('86', 76, 12, 18, 95350) He stated that you had spoken for the Congress party before.
('86', 76, 12, 19, 95411) In the context the suggestion seems to be that you candeal

('86', 77, 1, 3, 95894) What are your views on these suggestions?
('86', 77, 1, 4, 95936) In view of the statement made by Mr. Amery that “the Government Of India would no doubt need also to be satisfied that nothing would be done to impede or injure war efforts by direct opposition or by attempts to dislocate the economic situation”, will you be pleased to make things absolutely clear on the point?
('86', 77, 1, 5, 96249) [A.] 1 Wish is often father to the thought.
('86', 77, 1, 6, 96293) I see nothing new in Mr. Amery’s statement to Shri Karaka.
('86', 77, 1, 7, 96352) All talk of resolution of the present deadlock is useless so long as the members of the Working Committee and other Congressmen are under detention.
('86', 77, 1, 8, 96501) Obstruction of war effort is a mere bogey.
('86', 77, 1, 9, 96544) But if it means that there will be fierce criticism of the bungling and corruption that has gone on in the name of war effort it is true—not that there is no criticism now.
('86', 77, 1, 10, 96717) When the principal Congressmen are free there will be real national war effort if they are allowed to have an effective say.

('86', 77, 5, 18, 97157) Hence satyagraha is directly connected with soul force.
('86', 77, 6, 19, 97213) Q. What is the value or worth of independence?
('86', 77, 7, 20, 97260) A. The direct or straight road to independence is non violence.
('86', 77, 7, 21, 97324) We can or shall be immortal or live in death by dying non violently (or by sacrificing ourselves for a noble cause) but not by killing others (or by perpetrating violence).

('86', 77, 9, 26, 97658) 3 The report appeared under the date line “Sevagram, March 21, 1945”.
('86', 78, 0, 1, 97728) VOL. 86 : 4 MARCH, 1945 28 MAY, 1945 79
('86', 78, 1, 2, 97768) 150. FOREWORD TO “PRACTICE AND PRECEPTS OF JESUS”
('86', 78, 2, 3, 97818) Hating carefully gone through these chapters, I can recommend their careful 1 perusal to every believer in God be he a Christian or a follower of any other religion.
('86', 78, 2, 4, 97984) The booklet presents Professor J. C. Kumarappa’s views on Christian teaching in a nutshell.
('86', 78, 2, 5, 98076) It is a revolutionary view of Jesus as a man of God.
('86', 78, 2, 6, 98129) It is none the less revealing and interesting.
('86', 78, 2, 7, 98176) The interpretation of the Lord’s prayer is novel and refreshing as are many other interpretations.
('86', 78, 2, 8, 98275) If all believe as Prof.
('86', 78, 2, 9, 98299) Kumarappa does there will be no religious feuds and rivalries between sects and sects and different religions.
('86', 78, 2, 10, 98410) Anyway, this reading of the Bible must bring solace to the Christians of India.
('86', 78, 2, 11, 98490) If they will read the Bible as Prof.
('86', 78, 2, 12, 98527) K. does, they need not be ashamed 2 of their forefathers or their ancient faith.
('86', 78, 2, 13, 98608) What is bad and superstitious in the old they are able to throw off by means of the liberal teaching presented in the following pages but it helps one to see that there is much of the old which is imperishable and worthy of being treasured.
('86', 78, 2, 14, 98849) Indeed, Prof.
('86', 78, 2, 15, 98863) K. has a message beyond the confines of India.
('86', 78, 2, 16, 98910) He speaks with confidence born of a living faith in the belief that the West, though nominally Christian, has not known the true Jesus of the Gospels.
('86', 78, 2, 17, 99061) As I was going through these pages, I was reminded of the late Advocate F. A. Laughton of Durban.
('86', 78, 2, 18, 99159) I was then no student of Roman Or Dutch Law nor of the case law of the four States of South Africa.
('86', 78, 2, 19, 99259) In difficulty, therefore, I used to go to Mr. Laughton for help.
('86', 78, 2, 20, 99324) But, after I had done with my work, he would proudly bring forth from his drawer a green cover book with his father’s annotations from the Bible.
('86', 78, 2, 21, 99470) It was Edwin Arnold’s Song Celestial, and had Mr. Laughton’s father’s parallel passages from the Bible showing that there was much in common between the New Testament and the Gita.
('86', 78, 2, 22, 99651) I was then a novice trying to find out Truth in all its aspects without then knowing that I was so doing.
('86', 78, 2, 23, 99757) Kumarappa’s interpretation with copious quotations from the Bible reminded me of what I used to believe even
('86', 78, 3, 24, 99866) 1 This word is omitted in the printed source.
('86', 78, 3, 25, 99912) 2 The printed source has “apologetic”.

('86', 80, 8, 14, 101489) You could not do otherwise.
('86', 80, 8, 15, 101517) The central disease of India is its deep poverty and deeper ignorance.

('86', 81, 3, 4, 101955) MUNNALAL, You should never conclude from anything that I write that I must have examined every aspect.
('86', 81, 3, 5, 102058) That is for you readers to do.
('86', 81, 3, 6, 102089) I would of course relieve you and put up with whatever hardship follows.
('86', 81, 3, 7, 102162) But the truth is that you ought not to abandon the work you have taken up.
('86', 81, 3, 8, 102237) Man may not abandon his duty any more than the ant can abandon the pot of jaggery.
('86', 81, 3, 9, 102320) We, however, look upon duty not as a pot of jaggery but as a burden.
('86', 81, 3, 10, 102389) Otherwise how dare A. S. so much as suggest that you should leave?
('86', 81, 3, 11, 102456) But that is what happened.
('86', 81, 3, 12, 102483) I like what you say.
('86', 81, 3, 13, 102504) By all means cling to the kitchen and make it a model one.
('86', 81, 3, 14, 102563) It will bring you all the joy and you will get training along with the others.
('86', 81, 3, 15, 102642) The gods will shower flowers and it may be I shall be there to watch.

('86', 81, 3, 18, 102853) What more could you desire?
('86', 81, 3, 19, 102881) You now know my ideas fully.
('86', 81, 3, 20, 102910) Forget Kanchan if possible.
('86', 81, 3, 21, 102938) Write to her plainly that you are to get tempered here and she there.
('86', 81, 3, 22, 103008) After both of you have become tempered, you will meet again.
('86', 81, 3, 23, 103069) If you can do this, you will have brought down many fruits with one stone.

('86', 94, 6, 9, 117146) SEVAGRAM, March 24, 1945 I regret I shall not be able to be present throughout the entire proceedings.
('86', 94, 6, 10, 117249) The reason is that I wish to live for 125 years, so that I can serve the country longer.
('86', 94, 6, 11, 117338) I was not joking when I said so at the August meeting of A. I. C. C., for a satyagrahi never utters a word that he does not mean.
('86', 94, 6, 12, 117468) I earnestly endeavour to fulfil this wish of mine and to this end I try to conserve as much of my energy as I can.
('86', 94, 6, 13, 117583) Whether I succeed in my desire to live to 125 years will not depend on doctors or medical science, though in my own way I have used the aid of both a good deal.
('86', 94, 6, 14, 117744) It will depend on my ability fully to translate into practice the principles of truth and ahimsa.
('86', 94, 6, 15, 117842) My experience of ahimsa has taught me that even in the work of service the pace should not be too fast.
('86', 94, 6, 16, 117946) I confess that in this I have been only partially successful.
('86', 94, 6, 17, 118008) I cannot regulate my pace sufficiently.
('86', 94, 6, 18, 118048) Old, settled habits are not overcome all at once.
('86', 94, 6, 19, 118098) I know undue haste is bad; it impedes work instead of facilitating it.
('86', 94, 6, 20, 118169) I have been asked whether it is desirable to mix politics and constructive work.
('86', 94, 6, 21, 118250) At present some people are doing constructive workin order to strengthen the Congress organization.
('86', 94, 6, 22, 118350) This mixing of
('86', 94, 7, 23, 118365) 1 The addressee had asked: “What is meant by personality and how can we build it up?” 2 The meeting, attended by the Trustees, Provincial Secretaries and workers of A. I. S. A., was held in the Khadi Vidyalaya Hall.
('86', 95, 0, 1, 118581) 96 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('86', 95, 1, 2, 118622) politics and constructive work helps neither.
('86', 95, 1, 3, 118668) I entirely concur with the view that for full justice to be done to constructive work it must stand on its own feet and should not be tied to political work.
('86', 95, 1, 4, 118826) I fear this advice of mine will not have any effect.
('86', 95, 1, 5, 118879) But as the author of the Mahabharata says, ‘You must continue to proclaim the truth irrespective of whether anybody listens to you or not.’ This comforts me.
('86', 95, 1, 6, 119037) Since I first presented through the Congress the constructive programme to the country in 1920, my faith in its efficacy has become stronger.
('86', 95, 1, 7, 119179) In the light of experience and knowledge gained, its scope has been enlarged.
('86', 95, 1, 8, 119257) It is my claim, and I have proclaimed it from the house tops, that my 15 point programme is comprehensive and if it is pursued throughout the country we shall gain swaraj without any other programme.
('86', 95, 2, 9, 119457) Mahatma Gandhi referred to the formation of the Congress Ministry in the North West Frontier Province and the reported efforts of Mr. Bhulabhai Desai to end the political deadlock and said: 1
('86', 95, 3, 10, 119649) I prefer to keep silent on these points for the present.
('86', 95, 3, 11, 119706) The Parliamentary programme may result in political swaraj; but non violent swaraj is possible only by fully implementing the constructive programme.
('86', 95, 4, 12, 119856) If only the constructive programme was worked in the right spirit, there was no need either to incur the wrath of the ruling race or even to enter the Legislatures.
('86', 95, 4, 13, 120021) But Gandhiji urged that even if parliamentary work was permitted, the special importance of the constructive programme would always remain and through it alone the freedom of the country could be achieved.
('86', 95, 4, 14, 120227) It may be asked whether the people will take up the constructive programme and pursue it in the way I want it pursued.
('86', 95, 4, 15, 120346) My answer is that whether they do so or not does not take away from the merit of the remedy I advocate which is both good and practicable.
('86', 95, 4, 16, 120485) In this connection I have been asked whether, since carrying on of the movement against untouchability and organizing of peasants and workers in the name of the Congress provides a chance to Ambedkar and others to raise opposition and thus impede anti untouchability work, it would not be better if these programmes were pursued independently of the Congress.
('86', 95, 4, 17, 120845) It is my view that if the followers of Ambedkar oppose us we
('86', 95, 5, 18, 120906) 1 This and the two following paragraphs are from The Hindu.
('86', 96, 0, 1, 120966) VOL. 86 : 4 MARCH, 1945 28 MAY, 1945 97
('86', 96, 1, 2, 121006) should not let ourselves be provoked or give up our work because of it.
('86', 96, 1, 3, 121078) We should reach their hearts and understand their feelings.
('86', 96, 1, 4, 121138) If we had gone through the experiences that the Harijans have gone through, there is no telling how embittered we might not have become and how little our ahimsa would have endured.
('86', 96, 1, 5, 121320) Therefore on such occasions we should look inward and if there is the slightest vestige of untouchability left we should purge ourselves of it.
('86', 96, 1, 6, 121464) It is my firm belief that if Hinduism is to survive, untouchability must go.
('86', 96, 1, 7, 121541) If untouchability lives, Hinduism is bound to perish and will deserve to perish.
('86', 96, 1, 8, 121622) The tragedy is that those who should have especially devoted themselves to the work of reform did not put their hearts into the thing and only played with it.
('86', 96, 1, 9, 121781) What wonder that Harijan brethren feel suspicious, and show opposition and bitterness?
('86', 96, 1, 10, 121868) The removal of untouchability root and branch thus becomes a religious duty for me and for other Hindus like me.
('86', 96, 1, 11, 121981) If we want to achieve swaraj through non violence then untouchability will have to be eradicated.
('86', 96, 1, 12, 122079) We cannot attain swaraj without that.
('86', 96, 1, 13, 122117) Not all Congressmen share this view of mine.
('86', 96, 1, 14, 122162) The Cangress is a democratic organization and it can have in it people representing many points of view.
('86', 96, 1, 15, 122267) No one has the right to thrust his own view on others and expect them to work in pursuance of those views.
('86', 96, 1, 16, 122374) It will be right if those who consider eradication of untouchability a religious duty give themselves up exclusively to this work with single minded devotion.
('86', 96, 1, 17, 122533) At the same time it will also be right if those who consider anti untouchability work as a part of the political programme of the Congress pursue it as such.
('86', 96, 1, 18, 122691) Religious duty is a very subtle and complicated thing.
('86', 96, 1, 19, 122746) It is not a commodity that can be bought and sold.
('86', 96, 1, 20, 122797) Perpetual inner searching is needed in order to discover it.
('86', 96, 1, 21, 122858) In essence it is the same for all times and all places but its form and its translation into practice changes from individual to individual and from time to time.
('86', 96, 1, 22, 123021) If we can but grasp this secret of the many sidedness of truth we shall be able to see any differences between principles and practice in their proper perspective.
('86', 96, 1, 23, 123185) I therefore welcome both those who work for the eradication of untouchability independently and those who do so in pursuance of the Congress programme.
('86', 96, 2, 24, 123337) The same argument, he said, applied to the question whether Congressmen
('86', 96, 3, 25, 123409) 1 The following paragraph is from The Hindu.
('86', 97, 0, 1, 123454) 98 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('86', 97, 1, 2, 123495) could organize the kisans and workers.
('86', 97, 1, 3, 123534) Congressmen could not do it and yet remainCongressmen.
('86', 97, 1, 4, 123589) He said he had already informed Mr. N. G. Ranga that it would lead to conflict if there was a separate organization for peasants and workers and consequent weakening of both the organizations.
('86', 97, 2, 5, 123782) He himself had ceased to be a four anna member of the Congress and yet he claimed that he was rendering more service to the Congress by remaining outside.
('86', 97, 2, 6, 123937) Everyone could do like him but no one had the right to lay down the rule for others or expect them to fall into line with himself.
('86', 97, 2, 7, 124068) To find fault with those whose angle of approach to constructive work was different would be like cutting the very tree on which they were sitting.
('86', 97, 3, 8, 124216) Gandhiji concluded the first set of questions by repeating what he had often said before that he was there merely to advise.
('86', 97, 3, 9, 124341) No one was bound to accept his advice unless it appealed to his head and heart.
('86', 97, 3, 10, 124421) The other question asked is whether the funds of the Charkha Sangh can be used for giving training to khadi workers in other branches of constructive work, such as agriculture, animal husbandry and Nayee Talim, in order to equip them for allround village service.
('86', 97, 3, 11, 124685) My answer is no.
('86', 97, 3, 12, 124702) Funds collected for one institution cannot be spent on another.
('86', 97, 3, 13, 124766) According to the constitution of the Charkha Sangh its funds cannot be used for any purpose other than khadi.
('86', 97, 3, 14, 124876) Therefore expenditure on training in agriculture and animal husbandry should be borne by the institution concerned.
('86', 97, 3, 15, 124992) Otherwise it will lead to confusion.
('86', 97, 3, 16, 125029) If money belonging to one institution has to be advanced as loan to another institution, it should be done on proper security and on a reasonable rate of interest.
('86', 97, 3, 17, 125193) The job of a trustee is difficult and dedicate.
('86', 97, 3, 18, 125241) I have been atrustee of various institutions for over fifty years and every institution under me has flourished.
('86', 97, 3, 19, 125354) The secret of my success is not my Mahatmaship but my business sense and the meticulous care I show in maintaining accounts.
('86', 97, 3, 20, 125479) The success or otherwise of a public institution ought not to depend on the brilliance of an individual or individuals but on the purity of its management and the soundness of its business policy.
('86', 97, 3, 21, 125676) If you cultivate these money will come to you of itself.
('86', 97, 3, 22, 125733) A friend has suggested that khadi work instead of being carried on through the various branches of the Charkha Sangh should, within a specified time, be entrusted to workers engaged in all round village work who understand the scheme.
('86', 97, 3, 23, 125968) I agree with the suggestion, but I am not in favour of laying down a time limit for winding up all khadi production activity.
('86', 97, 3, 24, 126094) I am however very keen that all the khadi
('86', 97, 4, 25, 126136) 1 This and the following paragraph are from The Bombay Chronicle.
('86', 98, 0, 1, 126202) VOL. 86 : 4 MARCH, 1945 28 MAY, 1945 99
('86', 98, 1, 2, 126242) consumed in the villages should be produced in the villages by thevillagers themselves.
('86', 98, 1, 3, 126330) That will eliminate all incidental and overhead charges and put khadi beyond commercial competition.
('86', 98, 1, 4, 126431) This is the work which can very effectively be done through Nayee Talim.
('86', 98, 1, 5, 126504) Nayee Talim is all embracing in its scope.
('86', 98, 1, 6, 126547) That means it has to be like a magnet that attracts all, young and old.
('86', 98, 1, 7, 126619) So long as it does not develop this power it will be a body without soul.
('86', 98, 1, 8, 126693) If the Charkha Sangh is to free itself of the burden it carries, workers of the type needed will have to be produced.
('86', 98, 1, 9, 126811) These are lacking at present.
('86', 98, 1, 10, 126841) I therefore want that none of you should leave Sevagram till you have understood the principles of Nayee Talim.
('86', 98, 1, 11, 126953) I am as impatient as any of you to reach our goal but I realize that the task is an uphill one.
('86', 98, 1, 12, 127049) India has been enslaved for so long—its slavery dates since even before British rule—that all initiative and originality in us has been killed and we are paralyzed with despair.
('86', 98, 1, 13, 127227) Constructive work cannot make headway without a resuscitation of these lost qualities in us, and the attainment of independence through truth and non violence must remain an empty dream unless constructive work can be carried through to success.
('86', 98, 1, 14, 127473) Freedom is bound to come.
('86', 98, 1, 15, 127499) It is coming.
('86', 98, 1, 16, 127513) But mere political freedom will not satisfy me.
('86', 98, 1, 17, 127561) It will certainly not satisfy the world which expects much greater things from India.
('86', 98, 1, 18, 127647) Independence of my conception means nothing less than the realization of the “Kingdom of God within you and on this earth’’.
('86', 98, 1, 19, 127772) 1 I would rather work for and die in the pursuit of this dream though it may never be realized.
('86', 98, 1, 20, 127868) That means infinite patience and perseverance.
('86', 98, 1, 21, 127915) If India is satisfied with the mere attainment of political independence and there is nothing better for me to do, you will find me retiring to the Himalayas leaving those who wish to listen to me to seek me out there.
('86', 98, 2, 22, 128134) Gandhiji then offered to answer the remaining questions the next day 2 and before winding up his talk for the day he said that they need not be disheartened at the present state of the country.
('86', 98, 2, 23, 128328) He was happy that with infinite patience they had achieved something in spite of their slavery and other obstacles, and he was really proud of the achievement.

('86', 99, 2, 3, 128890) SEVAGRAM, March 25, 1945 South Africa has lost a most generous minded citizen and the Indians of that subcontinent a very warm friend.
('86', 99, 2, 4, 129025) In Hermann Kallenbach’s death I have lost a very dear and near friend.
('86', 99, 2, 5, 129096) He used to say to me often that when I was deserted by the whole world, I would find him to be a true friend going with me, if need be, to the ends of the earth in search of Truth.
('86', 99, 2, 6, 129277) He used to spend at one time £75 per month on his person alone.
('86', 99, 2, 7, 129341) But he so revolutionized his life that his monthly personal expenses amounted to under £8. This lasted while we lived together in a cottage seven miles from Johannesburg.
('86', 99, 2, 8, 129512) When I left South Africa, he reverted in large part to his original life though mostly eschewing the things of life he had deliberately left.
('86', 99, 2, 9, 129654) He came in close touch with the late patriot Mr. G. K. Gokhale, who held him in high esteem.
('86', 99, 2, 10, 129747) It may be noted that together with Henry Polak, Mr. H. Kallenbach was arrested for marching with me from Natal to Transvaal 2. The Hindu, 27 3 1945

('86', 101, 2, 3, 131889) SEVAGRAM, March 25, 1945 Jajuji says that the quantity of yarn tendered in partial payment for khadi should be increased from two pice to 2_ as., or a hank of yarn per rupee.
('86', 101, 2, 4, 132064) This is too mild.
('86', 101, 2, 5, 132082) I would go further.
('86', 101, 2, 6, 132102) Some days back Bombay had become the Manchester of khadi.
('86', 101, 2, 7, 132160) Khadi was brought from far and wide and sold there.
('86', 101, 2, 8, 132212) The credit for this went to the salesmanship of Shri Vithaldas Jerajani.
('86', 101, 2, 9, 132285) It was thanks to his efforts that first swadeshi goods and then khadi entered Bombay.
('86', 101, 2, 10, 132371) But now I see that that was not the light way.
('86', 101, 2, 11, 132418) Khadi, in the first place, should be consumed where it is produced.
('86', 101, 2, 12, 132486) If in a particular place khadi in excess of the requirement is produced the surplus should be sent to the nearest place where it is needed.
('86', 101, 2, 13, 132626) The district should be the limit or at most the province.
('86', 101, 2, 14, 132684) Indeed I would not go even as far as the province.
('86', 101, 2, 15, 132735) A district is a large enough area for this sort of transaction.
('86', 101, 2, 16, 132799) The aim of course is that the khadi produced in a village should be sold in that village.
('86', 101, 2, 17, 132889) But out of the seven lakh villages in India how many are there which can make this claim about themselves?
('86', 101, 2, 18, 132996) In the villages where khadi is produced the spinners and weavers, for all the efforts of the Charkha Sangh, use very little of the khadi they produce.
('86', 101, 2, 19, 133147) This is against the ideal of khadi.
('86', 101, 2, 20, 133183) The condition of two pice per rupee to be tendered in yarn for the purchase of khadi does not apply to villagers.
('86', 101, 2, 21, 133297) They must sell khadi only in exchange of yarn.
('86', 101, 2, 22, 133344) Do you fear that if you enforce the yarn condition the sale of khadi in cities will suffer?
('86', 101, 2, 23, 133436) If you do not get rid of this fear you will kill khadi.
('86', 101, 3, 24, 133492) The rule of giving half an anna worth of yarn for one rupee of khadi purchased is generally meant for big cities and I would desire that all should spin and produce their khadi.
('86', 101, 3, 25, 133670) Khadi is the emblem oftruth and non violence.
('86', 101, 3, 26, 133716) Such exchange of yarn may result in reducing the number of khadi wearers but we should carry on our work in that direction and ultimately we shall succeed.
('86', 101, 3, 27, 133872) Khadi has won a place of honour in society.
('86', 101, 3, 28, 133916) The rich feel proud of buying khadi produced by the poor.
('86', 101, 3, 29, 133974) But this is not enough.
('86', 101, 3, 30, 133998) If you limit the role of khadi to providing bread to the poor, it cannot be an

('86', 102, 1, 2, 134177) instrument for securing swaraj through non violence.
('86', 102, 1, 3, 134230) I do not want this.
('86', 102, 1, 4, 134250) Even if I were the only one left to buy khadi on condition of yarn being tendered I should not worry.
('86', 102, 1, 5, 134352) You have accepted khadi as the symbol of non violence.
('86', 102, 1, 6, 134407) You have also accepted it as the means for securing swaraj.
('86', 102, 1, 7, 134467) If it is the will of God that khadi should die I would rather it died a natural death than that your timidity and lack of faith should be the cause of its demise.
('86', 102, 1, 8, 134630) Those who for some reason cannot themselves spin can get their wives, mothers, sisters or servants to spin.
('86', 102, 1, 9, 134738) Failing that they may get yarn from their neighbours but not on payment.
('86', 102, 2, 10, 134811) Next he produced some figures 2 which Shri Aryanayakum and Smt.
('86', 102, 2, 11, 134875) Asha Devi had given him.
('86', 102, 2, 12, 134900) He considered those figures to be most revealing.
('86', 102, 2, 13, 134950) They were proof positive of how quickly khadi could be introduced in the villages through Nayee Talim.
('86', 102, 2, 14, 135053) Cloth produced by the children during the period of their training would be sufficient to cloth the entire village and it would be the cheapest cloth possible.
('86', 102, 2, 15, 135213) We should increase our love for khadi and serve the villages.
('86', 102, 2, 16, 135275) You should make all your dependents khadi wearers.
('86', 102, 2, 17, 135326) I have compared khadi to the sun and the other industries to the planets in the solar system.
('86', 102, 2, 18, 135420) Agriculture is a planet in this solar system but it cannot be the sun, for agriculture is not free.
('86', 102, 2, 19, 135520) Those who till the land do not own it.
('86', 102, 2, 20, 135559) The Government controls it through petty officials.
('86', 102, 2, 21, 135611) The people have lost self confidence.
('86', 102, 2, 22, 135649) Harmful customs have led to fragmentation of land.
('86', 102, 2, 23, 135700) If I am alive fifty years hence and if by that time people have gained control of the land I shall reconsider its place in my solar system.
('86', 102, 2, 24, 135840) I can say that agriculture by itself cannot develop the intellect as much as khadi and other village industries can.
('86', 102, 2, 25, 135957) As the late Madhusudan once said, constant company of bullocks turns men into bullocks.
('86', 102, 2, 26, 136045) The gist of what I have told you during the past two days is that if you have faith in my ideal you should put your whole effort behind it.
('86', 102, 2, 27, 136185) The Shastras proclaim that Truth ever triumphs.
('86', 102, 2, 28, 136233) This is a universally valid principle.
('86', 102, 2, 29, 136272) If sometimes in life it is seen to fail the reason is not that the principle is at fault.
('86', 102, 2, 30, 136362) It shows the imperfection of the man who is applying the principle.
('86', 102, 2, 31, 136430) Once you have understood the principle you will have developed that detachment and that freedom

('86', 103, 4, 7, 136991) March 25, 1945
('86', 103, 5, 8, 137006) Q. 1. Some members of the Charkha Sangh took a leading part in sabotage activities.
('86', 103, 5, 9, 137090) .The Government became suspicious and took represssive measures against such organizations.
('86', 103, 5, 10, 137182) In such a situation, is it not a mistake to put the entire blame on the Government?
('86', 103, 6, 11, 137266) A. Just because some worker went astray, it was wrong to punish the Charkha Sangh.
('86', 103, 6, 12, 137349) I blame the Government entirely for its high handedness.
('86', 103, 7, 13, 137406) Q. 2. Some Congressmen whose faith in non violence was not very strong ...
('86', 103, 7, 14, 137481) are full of ideas regarding sabotage.
('86', 103, 7, 15, 137519) How can these people be weaned away from these ideas?
('86', 103, 8, 16, 137573) A. Those who have lost faith in non violence will recover it through the work of the people who have retained their faith.
('86', 103, 8, 17, 137696) They will never recover it through reprimands.
('86', 103, 8, 18, 137743) They are following their own convictions.
('86', 103, 8, 19, 137785) Let us be perfect as they are imperfect Darkness is dispelled by the rising of the sun.
('86', 103, 9, 20, 137873) Q. 3. These days the committees for constructive work appointed by the Congress are full of people with the ideas mentioned in question No.
('86', 103, 9, 21, 138013) 2. There are some devoted people too.
('86', 103, 9, 22, 138051) Do you believe that the constructive work can make progress with the help of such committees?
('86', 103, 10, 23, 138145) A. The constructive work will proceed if the people having faith can give expression to their faith not through words but through deeds.
('86', 103, 11, 24, 138282) Q. 4. Under such circumstances, would it not be better that the people having faith in non violence should carry on their work independently of others?
('86', 103, 12, 25, 138434) A. The answer is contained in the previous answers and also in my speech.
('86', 103, 13, 26, 138508) 1 The questions were from Pundalik Katagde.

('86', 104, 0, 1, 138605) VOL. 86 : 4 MARCH, 1945 28 MAY, 1945 105
('86', 104, 1, 2, 138646) Q. 5. Those who have no faith in non violence and, for that reason, are not able to contribute to the programme based on non violence are in a very uncomfortable position in the constructive work committees.
('86', 104, 1, 3, 138854) This has a demoralizing effect on them.
('86', 104, 1, 4, 138894) In such a situation would it not be proper to let their efforts find scope in Parliamentary activities?
('86', 104, 2, 5, 138998) A. Do we restrict anyone from going into the Parliament?
('86', 104, 2, 6, 139055) It is enough that we do not go ourselves.
('86', 104, 3, 7, 139097) Q. 6. Will there not be greater scope for basic education, stopping corruption, improving the food situation, removing the difficulties of the villagers and so on, if the Congress assumes power?
('86', 104, 4, 8, 139292) A. It may or may not happen.
('86', 104, 4, 9, 139321) It will depend on what type of people come forward and on the state of public opinion.
('86', 104, 5, 10, 139408) Q. 7....
('86', 104, 5, 11, 139417) Can I give my opinion in favour of bringing electricity to the villages, particularly in Hudli?
('86', 104, 6, 12, 139513) A. I am strongly opposed to it.
('86', 104, 6, 13, 139545) My answers are not meant for publication.
('86', 104, 6, 14, 139587) Yon can show them to friends.
('86', 104, 7, 15, 139617) BAPU [PS.] I have not revised this.

('86', 106, 7, 15, 141269) [March 26, 1945] 1
('86', 106, 8, 16, 141288) MUNNALAL, Here is for your guidance.
('86', 106, 8, 17, 141325) There must be rules, and they must be obeyed.
('86', 106, 8, 18, 141371) Manage somehow during these five days.
('86', 106, 8, 19, 141410) Then after my return we shall see.
('86', 106, 8, 20, 141445) I am in favour of two kitchens.
('86', 106, 8, 21, 141477) If I were in your place, I would attend to everything you mention and do it well.
('86', 106, 8, 22, 141559) I have done that.
('86', 106, 8, 23, 141577) But that does not mean that, your doing what I would have done will necessarily bear fruit.
('86', 106, 8, 24, 141669) There is no such rule.
('86', 106, 8, 25, 141692) You may act as you like, but on one condition, namely, that you must be absolutely sure that you are following truth and ahimsa.
('86', 106, 8, 26, 141821) If the persons you have named do not observe the rules, you should talk to them one by one and find out why.
('86', 106, 8, 27, 141930) If a person admits the fact, you may make an exception in his favour, and if you find that the exceptions are so many that they defeat the rule you should revise the rule.
('86', 106, 8, 28, 142102) I understand from what you write that the exceptions do defeat the rule.
('86', 106, 8, 29, 142175) This isindeed a hotel.
('86', 106, 8, 30, 142198) But it is more than that.
('86', 106, 8, 31, 142224) A hotel is a place where
('86', 106, 9, 32, 142249) 1 The addressee’s letter, to which this is a reply, was delivered to Gandhiji at 5.15 a.
('86', 106, 9, 33, 142338) on March 25, and this letter was acknowledged at 6.15 a.

('86', 107, 1, 2, 142450) people pay for boarding and lodging.
('86', 107, 1, 3, 142487) They order and get whatever they want, and feel no embarrassment.
('86', 107, 1, 4, 142553) It should be so here also.
('86', 107, 1, 5, 142580) Here, too, we must have some rules, as every hotel has.
('86', 107, 1, 6, 142636) For instance, we would serve no non vegetarian food or cater to people’s taste in regard to spices.
('86', 107, 1, 7, 142736) Let Shakaribehn start a separate kitchen.
('86', 107, 1, 8, 142778) Anybody else who wishes may also do that.
('86', 107, 1, 9, 142820) Meet every permanent resident and know from him or her their wishes, then frame rules and get them passed in the presence of all and see that everyone observes the rule which he himself has accepted.
('86', 107, 1, 10, 143020) I knew about Kamle today by chance.
('86', 107, 1, 11, 143056) He is suffering from dysentery.
('86', 107, 1, 12, 143088) I have asked him today to go immediately.
('86', 107, 1, 13, 143130) He should have gone earlier.
('86', 107, 1, 14, 143159) It was only from your note that I came to know that Gurbuxani and Vimalabehn have made separate arrangements for their meals.
('86', 107, 1, 15, 143285) You ought to have complete information as to which persons do that and why.
('86', 107, 1, 16, 143361) Instead, you permit anarchy to reign.
('86', 107, 1, 17, 143399) Is it right?
('86', 107, 1, 18, 143412) I think I have given all the guidance you need.
('86', 107, 1, 19, 143460) Now think over Sushilabehn’s advice.
('86', 107, 1, 20, 143497) A plate, a cup for water, two bowls and one spoon.
('86', 107, 1, 21, 143548) The plate, the cup and the bowls should be nickel plated.
('86', 107, 1, 22, 143606) About the spoon I am not convinced.
('86', 107, 1, 23, 143642) Two bowls may be all right, though I am not sure.
('86', 107, 1, 24, 143692) Serving ghee with the vegetable will not do.
('86', 107, 1, 25, 143737) Perhaps it will not do even to put it on the chapatis.
('86', 107, 1, 26, 143792) If the vegetable is served in a bowl, ghee may be added to it.
('86', 107, 1, 27, 143855) But I have seen only one bowl in many places.
('86', 107, 1, 28, 143901) I am giving no ruling in this matter.
('86', 107, 1, 29, 143939) Personally, I would provide only one bowl.
('86', 107, 1, 30, 143982) But I give no ruling.
('86', 107, 1, 31, 144004) You had told me that you would take out from your notebook and give me the portions regarding myself.
('86', 107, 1, 32, 144106) Do that before my departure.
('86', 107, 1, 33, 144135) The decision to talk to every permanent resident in private, to frame rules and discuss them in the presence of all is for immediate implementation.
('86', 107, 1, 34, 144284) About the separate kitchen it should be postponed till my return.
('86', 107, 1, 35, 144350) Show me the rules.
('86', 107, 1, 36, 144369) Those who wish to have separate arrangements from today may be permitted to have them.

('86', 108, 2, 3, 144636) MUNNALAL, It would be better if the thing was done before I left for Bombay.
('86', 108, 2, 4, 144713) 1 But do not sacrifice your sleep for that.
('86', 108, 2, 5, 144757) I was glad that the problem about Sushilabehn had been solved.
('86', 108, 2, 6, 144820) My success holds no lesson for anybody, but it may give one hope.
('86', 108, 2, 7, 144886) There may be many reasons for my success.
('86', 108, 2, 8, 144928) According to me, the chief reason is my ahimsa.
('86', 108, 2, 9, 144976) From your point of view it is true that your training has not fitted you for managing a kitchen.
('86', 108, 2, 10, 145073) When you learn non attachment you will not say that.
('86', 108, 2, 11, 145126) We are fit enough for any duty that comes to us unsought.
('86', 108, 2, 12, 145184) The secret is that we do not run after any task; the task comes to us unsought.
('86', 108, 2, 13, 145264) If you look upon a servant as your own brother or sister, you will never fail.
('86', 108, 2, 14, 145343) Yesterday the kedgeree was not well cooked.
('86', 108, 2, 15, 145387) Manu refused to eat it and so I examined it with my fingers.
('86', 108, 2, 16, 145448) Finding that it was insufficiently cooked I made her a sign that she need not eat it.
('86', 108, 2, 17, 145534) If I had insisted, she would have consumed it and suffered from stomachache in consequence.
('86', 108, 2, 18, 145626) If everybody had eaten it that would have been no evidence that it was well cooked.
('86', 108, 2, 19, 145710) I explained to Kalukhan himself about Magandeep.
('86', 108, 2, 20, 145759) I understand about Aundh.
('86', 108, 2, 21, 145785) I think nothing remains now.
('86', 108, 2, 22, 145814) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] Instead of engraving people’s names on the utensils, they should be numbered.
('86', 108, 2, 23, 145918) This is the practice in jails, as also in institutions.
('86', 108, 2, 24, 145974) Instead of purchasing additional utensils, find some way out.
('86', 108, 2, 25, 146036) In the last resort, we can always have [leaf cups] 2. If you can have inexpensive earthen ones you may have them.
('86', 108, 2, 26, 146150) Everybody may make for himself spoons of wood.
('86', 108, 2, 27, 146197) We can teach them.
('86', 108, 2, 28, 146216) It is quite easy to learn.
('86', 108, 2, 29, 146243) Think what the poor would do and find some way.
('86', 108, 2, 30, 146291) Discuss the matter with the permanent residents.
('86', 108, 2, 31, 146340) Mohan Singh will probably suggest something.
('86', 108, 2, 32, 146385) Moreover, now I shall be leaving, so you will have no difficulty during that time.
('86', 108, 2, 33, 146468) Think over the matter before I return.
('86', 108, 2, 34, 146507) You can certainly make wooden ones.
('86', 108, 2, 35, 146543) We used to do that in S. A. The wood and the knife were supplied by the jail authorities.

('86', 109, 9, 19, 147435) It is a pity your health has deteriorated so much.
('86', 109, 9, 20, 147486) You have got to get well somehow.
('86', 109, 9, 21, 147520) And both of you should stay there till you get leave.

('86', 110, 8, 13, 148405) Your indecision comes from your fear of committing mistakes.
('86', 110, 8, 14, 148466) We must quickly take decisions even if they should turn out to be mistaken.

('86', 110, 13, 22, 148745) You get a scholarship there.
('86', 110, 13, 23, 148774) There are so many women with you.
('86', 110, 13, 24, 148808) It is therefore your duty to stay there and give satisfaction to your seniors.
('86', 110, 13, 25, 148887) At this time it is very hot here and it will continue so for at least two months.
('86', 110, 13, 26, 148969) If you do good work there, I shall have you here later on.

('86', 112, 8, 13, 150504) Your pen runs independently of you.
('86', 112, 8, 14, 150540) Discipline it and then let it climb a hill.
('86', 112, 8, 15, 150584) I can only indicate the ideal.
('86', 112, 8, 16, 150615) It is for you to reach it or not.
('86', 112, 8, 17, 150649) How can I say that you can do so much and no more?
('86', 112, 8, 18, 150700) I shall try to adjust myself to you as much as I can.
('86', 112, 8, 19, 150754) Perhaps there is no spare pair of sandals.
('86', 112, 8, 20, 150797) You will get the loin cloth.
('86', 112, 8, 21, 150826) It cannot be called a lungi.
('86', 112, 8, 22, 150855) A lungi cannot be tucked up from behind.
('86', 112, 8, 23, 150896) Bhansali and Balkrishna wear lungis.
('86', 112, 8, 24, 150933) Give up hope of sandals.
('86', 112, 8, 25, 150958) I have no spare pair at all.

('86', 112, 8, 28, 151059) Make notes from them and give me a copy.
('86', 112, 8, 29, 151100) Wooden sandals are inexpensive and easy to make.
('86', 112, 8, 30, 151149) You may use leather or webbing or cloth for the strips.
('86', 112, 8, 31, 151205) You should train people one by one to join in the prayers.
('86', 112, 8, 32, 151264) If they are not prepared to give that much time, only those who can sing in tune may join.
('86', 112, 8, 33, 151355) The truth is that even after so many years people have developed no deep interest in the prayers.
('86', 112, 8, 34, 151453) Theattendance at morning prayers is practically nil.
('86', 112, 8, 35, 151506) But don’t exert yourself about this just now.

('86', 113, 1, 3, 151693) It will be enough if you keep up the other items of the programme.
('86', 113, 1, 4, 151760) Since you do not know the beauty of joint recitation, you have not been able to describe it.
('86', 113, 1, 5, 151853) Everybody gets breathing time and yet they all seem to be singing in unison.
('86', 113, 1, 6, 151930) I am saying this from experience.
('86', 113, 1, 7, 151964) Don’t write to other institutions now to make any inquiry.
('86', 113, 1, 8, 152023) Will there be a shortage of rooms after I leave?
('86', 113, 1, 9, 152072) I will see about Hari ichchha.
('86', 113, 1, 10, 152103) It is easy to turn steam into water.
('86', 113, 1, 11, 152140) We should learn to do that.

('86', 113, 4, 19, 152443) Sometimes dreams are due to our impatience.
('86', 113, 4, 20, 152487) Many a time we worry unconsciously and then we get dreams.
('86', 113, 4, 21, 152546) In such cases we should keep repeating Ramanama.

('86', 114, 8, 18, 154004) Why do you need a certificate?
('86', 114, 8, 19, 154035) For a follower of truth, truth is certificate enough.
('86', 114, 8, 20, 154089) Asking for certificates is a very bad habit.
('86', 114, 8, 21, 154134) I showed interest in it for some time; but it is 55 years since I gave it up.
('86', 114, 8, 22, 154212) Do not take any from me or from anyone else.
('86', 114, 8, 23, 154257) Do not [ask for favours] 1 but strive hard on the strength of your truth and non violence.

('86', 123, 8, 14, 163735) The acknowledgment is enclosed.
('86', 123, 8, 15, 163767) But I have not been able to decide so far whether I should issue the appeal about the Fund.

('86', 125, 3, 4, 165249) CHIMANLAL, Have you read my letter to Krishnachandra?
('86', 125, 3, 5, 165303) One cannot observe one dharma by violating another.
('86', 125, 3, 6, 165355) I have not at all given a one sided decision.
('86', 125, 3, 7, 165401) Krishnachandra should come to a decision after fullconsideration.
('86', 125, 3, 8, 165467) I remain neutral.
('86', 125, 3, 9, 165485) All of you should arrive at a joint decision.
('86', 125, 3, 10, 165531) And you should do it promptly without fear of going wrong.
('86', 125, 3, 11, 165590) A mistake can always be corrected.
('86', 125, 3, 12, 165625) It is all right if Prabhakar looks after the girl.
('86', 125, 3, 13, 165676) It is, however, not at all desirable.
('86', 125, 3, 14, 165714) Some woman ought to look after her.
('86', 125, 3, 15, 165750) It is not a burden.
('86', 125, 3, 16, 165770) It is a matter of duty.
('86', 125, 3, 17, 165794) I think it will not be possible for me to accommodate Ramprasad.
('86', 125, 3, 18, 165859) R. P. is an absolutely independent minded person.
('86', 125, 3, 19, 165909) Besides, I must have Sushila’s consent too.
('86', 125, 3, 20, 165953) We should act under the assumption that it is her responsibility.
('86', 125, 3, 21, 166019) I consider it a serious defect that you could not frame the rules.

('86', 130, 1, 2, 171482) 248. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
('86', 130, 2, 3, 171510) BOMBAY, March 31, 1945 The National Week 1 will be presently on us.
('86', 130, 2, 4, 171578) We began to observe the Week in 1919. We had the unexpected and spontaneous manifestation of the villagers all over India.
('86', 130, 2, 5, 171701) Seven days after, Jallianwala Bagh massacre, also unthought of, took place.
('86', 130, 2, 6, 171777) We have observed the Week ever since in triple expectation of achieving communal unity, full establishment of khaddar and swaraj.
('86', 130, 2, 7, 171907) We seemed to be at one time within an ace of the triple achievement.
('86', 130, 2, 8, 171976) But today we seem to be very far.
('86', 130, 2, 9, 172010) I advisedly use the verb “seem”.
('86', 130, 2, 10, 172043) The goal ever seems to recede from us but if we have honestly worked for it, it really comes nearer.
('86', 130, 2, 11, 172144) Anyhow I feel so.
('86', 130, 2, 12, 172162) We were never nearer the goal than now in spite of our many blunders.
('86', 130, 2, 13, 172232) It is as well that we remember our blunders and fail to notice the successes lying underneath.
('86', 130, 2, 14, 172327) Only our blunders must never dishearten us.
('86', 130, 2, 15, 172371) We must learn to profit by them and correct them.
('86', 130, 2, 16, 172421) Then every blunder will hearten us, for we shall mount a step higher by unlearning each blunder.
('86', 130, 2, 17, 172518) Thus it becomes a cleansing process.
('86', 130, 2, 18, 172555) Let it be noted that khaddar has attained a wider connotation than before.
('86', 130, 2, 19, 172630) It has become the central sun round which other village industries revolve like so many planets.
('86', 130, 2, 20, 172727) Moreover it now represents the fifteenfold constructive programme.
('86', 130, 2, 21, 172794) Khaddar itself has after much experience got its proper value and thus has received a dignity never before given to it.
('86', 130, 2, 22, 172914) Everyone is now able, with the introduction by Vinoba of ‘tunar’ 2 to make his or her ‘punis’ 3 and spin with ease.
('86', 130, 2, 23, 173030) The wheel too has undergone radical improvement and the new process of doubling yarn has made it as strong as one could wish for weaving.
('86', 130, 2, 24, 173168) Would that every lover of freedom of India will remember these things during the Week and bring freedom nearer than ever before without parliamentary programme and even civil disobedience unless the Government drive workers to it by talking of India’s freedom without meaning it.

('86', 131, 2, 3, 173602) BOMBAY, March 31, 1945 If the news is correct that the Ashti and Chimur petition has been rejected, it is disturbing.
('86', 131, 2, 4, 173720) 1 I am opposed to State hanging in every case, but most so in cases like these.
('86', 131, 2, 5, 173800) Whatever was done by the people on and after August 9, 1942, was done under excitement.
('86', 131, 2, 6, 173888) If these hangings are now carried out, it will be cold blooded, calculated murder and worse, because it will be done ceremoniously and under the name of so called law.
('86', 131, 2, 7, 174056) It will leave behind nothing but a great increase in the already existing woeful bitterness.
('86', 131, 2, 8, 174149) How I wish that the threatened hangings were given up.
('86', 131, 2, 9, 174204) They can be if there is the united voice of India against the impending sentences and such other contemplated sentences.

('86', 134, 3, 5, 179535) The correspondence between you and Bapa was read.
('86', 134, 3, 6, 179585) Your letter was finished and I saw at the end that you had meant it to be confidential.
('86', 134, 3, 7, 179673) There was no reason for it.
('86', 134, 3, 8, 179701) There was nothing to be ashamed of in it.
('86', 134, 3, 9, 179743) Your own part was creditable to you and so was Kamlabai’s and her husband’s.
('86', 134, 3, 10, 179820) Her salary should be drawn to the extent of her needs.
('86', 134, 3, 11, 179875) She must not be a burden on her husband.
('86', 134, 3, 12, 179916) Since Bapa agrees that you can have the furniture, your estimate is right.
('86', 134, 3, 13, 179991) But I question the necessity of all furniture.
('86', 134, 3, 14, 180038) You should squat an the ground.
('86', 134, 3, 15, 180070) Then you don’t need chairs and tables at all.
('86', 134, 3, 16, 180116) Mats are quite enough.
('86', 134, 3, 17, 180139) You may need a ground desk for the typist.

('86', 134, 3, 19, 180203) You may have open racks.
('86', 134, 3, 20, 180228) You have provided for a safe.
('86', 134, 3, 21, 180258) You can draw Rs. 150 and divide between the two institutions as occasion requires.
('86', 134, 3, 22, 180341) Please redraw your budget in the light of what I have said and send.
('86', 134, 3, 23, 180410) I shall have the power to sanction your budget if I approve of it.
('86', 134, 4, 24, 180477) Yours sincerely, BAPU [PS.] You need only a Tamil typewriter.

('86', 135, 6, 20, 181669) I am employing the means I know for saving the lives of the condemned prisoners 2. Fasting in this case is no remedy.

('86', 139, 7, 16, 186389) BOMBAY, April 3, 1945
('86', 139, 8, 17, 186411) Gandhiji said that it was a matter for shame that they had come to pray to God but failed to conduct the prayer peacefully.
('86', 139, 8, 18, 186535) People shouted and did not allow the prayer to go on, as it should go on.
('86', 139, 9, 19, 186609) Continuing, he said that he had been told by a friend that the people of Bombay would derive no benefit from his prayer.
('86', 139, 9, 20, 186730) They would throw a few rupees for the Harijan Fund, but if he thought that it was going to produce any effect on them or
('86', 139, 10, 21, 186851) 1 The meeting was attended by about 30,000 people.
('86', 139, 10, 22, 186902) Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan was among those present.
('86', 139, 10, 23, 186951) 2 The crowd attending the prayer had become unmanageable at one stage and a number of people including Sushila Nayyar and Krishna Hatheesingh had got hurt in the rush.
('86', 140, 0, 1, 187119) VOL. 86 : 4 MARCH, 1945 28 MAY, 1945 141
('86', 140, 1, 2, 187160) that they would embrace the Harijans as their own kith and kin he was mistaken.
('86', 140, 2, 3, 187240) “If you want, you go to Bombay.
('86', 140, 2, 4, 187272) You will get money but as far as prayers are concerned, it is better to stay at home and pray,” the friend had warned him.
('86', 140, 3, 5, 187395) Gandhiji said that he was not entirely convinced.
('86', 140, 3, 6, 187445) They could not see God with the naked eye.
('86', 140, 3, 7, 187488) They could not touch Him with their hands.
('86', 140, 3, 8, 187531) He had become an untouchable.
('86', 140, 3, 9, 187561) And no wonder, considering that there was so much sin abroad, such violence, drinking and gambling.
('86', 140, 3, 10, 187661) Forty crores of people were in serfdom.
('86', 140, 3, 11, 187701) This was because they only talked of freedom but they did not know what freedom was really worth.
('86', 140, 3, 12, 187799) But he told this friend that he had always conducted prayers for a long time.
('86', 140, 3, 13, 187877) He was a firm believer in prayer.
('86', 140, 3, 14, 187911) Every religion had taught that man was no man if he did not pray to his Maker.
('86', 140, 3, 15, 187990) Therefore he had told this friend that though there was not much chance of his advice being followed, he could not give up his principles.
('86', 140, 3, 16, 188129) If he did not trust the people even that much, he would be worth nothing.
('86', 140, 3, 17, 188203) If he gave up prayer the next thing for him to do would be to give up the struggle for freedom, the striving for truth and non violence.
('86', 140, 4, 18, 188340) He told the people that they should let him come and go without rushing towards him.
('86', 140, 4, 19, 188425) They should keep silent during prayers.
('86', 140, 5, 20, 188465) In conclusion, Gandhiji asked them how, if they could not control themselves, they could wield the reins of power.
('86', 140, 5, 21, 188580) He would come there the next day and every day thereafter as long as he stayed in Bombay.
('86', 140, 5, 22, 188670) He would watch how far his words had gone home.
('86', 140, 5, 23, 188718) He would find out how far they were fit to govern themselves.
('86', 140, 5, 24, 188780) The man with God in his heart would know how to control himself.

('86', 142, 9, 20, 190984) (2) My view about propagation of music is that that alone is real music which uplifts the soul.
('86', 142, 9, 21, 191080) This contains everything I should like to suggest.
('86', 142, 9, 22, 191131) (3) I have already explained that music is a constructive activity, but that it is not included in the Congress programme.
('86', 142, 9, 23, 191254) Swaraj can be conceived without it.
('86', 142, 9, 24, 191290) It cannot, therefore, be one of the objects for which Narandas is collecting a fund.
('86', 142, 9, 25, 191375) That is why I have said that, if we do not demand a salary for you, you should take the money from me.

('86', 146, 2, 3, 195143) BOMBAY April 6, 1945
('86', 146, 3, 4, 195164) Gandhiji began by asking people to keep silent and listen patiently to whatever he had to say.
('86', 146, 3, 5, 195259) Nobody should clap hands.
('86', 146, 3, 6, 195285) He wanted their ear; he wanted their heart.
('86', 146, 3, 7, 195329) If his words reached their hearts through their ears, he would be satisfied.
('86', 146, 4, 8, 195406) He congratulated them on their disciplined behaviour since Tuesday.
('86', 146, 4, 9, 195474) On that day two women had been hurt.
('86', 146, 4, 10, 195511) They had been perhaps touched by the incident and had decided to maintain discipline and allow the prayers to go on as usual.
('86', 146, 4, 11, 195637) On that day, there was a large crowd not lakhs but a few thousands.
('86', 146, 4, 12, 195705) Whether it was because of thefact that there were fewer people or for any other reason, he was glad to find that they had learnt discipline.
('86', 146, 4, 13, 195846) If they wanted to live together the first lesson they should learn was one of discipline.
('86', 146, 5, 14, 195936) Continuing, Gandhiji said that he was a Gujarati and should normally speak in Gujarati.
('86', 146, 5, 15, 196024) But it had been decided that whenever there was a cosmopolitan gathering they should speak in the national language.
('86', 146, 5, 16, 196141) He was responsible for that decision as much as others.
('86', 146, 5, 17, 196197) They had also to learn both the scripts, namely, Nagari and Urdu.
('86', 146, 5, 18, 196263) And they should learn to speak in such a simple way that everybody would understand it.
('86', 146, 5, 19, 196351) He had now realized that Urdu, Hindi, and Hindustani were all the same language.
('86', 146, 5, 20, 196432) If they learnt that language they could deal with members of any community and people from any part of India.
('86', 146, 5, 21, 196542) It served him when he went to the Punjab.
('86', 146, 5, 22, 196584) It would serve him if he were to go to Kashmir—he had not been there, but he had some Kashmiri friends— Jawaharlal was one of them.
('86', 146, 5, 23, 196716) Gandhiji said that it was wrong to refer to a Muslim language or a Muslim script.
('86', 146, 5, 24, 196798) Both Hindus and Muslims wrote that language and if they wanted to steal the hearts of these people, they should be able to speak the same language and write in that script.
('86', 146, 6, 25, 196971) Adverting to the National Week, Gandhiji said that they had been observing the Week for the last 26 years.
('86', 146, 6, 26, 197078) Its observance was meant for the purification of their thoughts and their language.
('86', 146, 6, 27, 197162) In the beginning, the Week commenced with a fast.
('86', 146, 6, 28, 197212) He had since abandoned that.
('86', 146, 6, 29, 197241) He had also abandoned hartal.
('86', 146, 6, 30, 197271) The Week, however, had not become less holy on that account.
('86', 146, 6, 31, 197332) The fifteen point programme was there.
('86', 146, 6, 32, 197371) It began with khadi.
('86', 146, 6, 33, 197392) From that followed other items.
('86', 146, 6, 34, 197424) On such a holy day the people should begin to observe the fifteen point programme.
('86', 146, 6, 35, 197507) He was not asking them to observe it only for the Week but for all time.
('86', 146, 6, 36, 197580) They should not only follow it themselves but induce other people to do so.
('86', 146, 6, 37, 197656) If they wanted to make India free and not wait for others to free her, if they wanted to get freedom by truthful and non violent means, there was no other way.
('86', 146, 6, 38, 197816) But if it was to be by violence and revolution, that was another thing.
('86', 147, 0, 1, 197888) 148 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('86', 147, 1, 2, 197930) He had not known that method; he had not learnt it.
('86', 147, 1, 3, 197982) Freedom would not fall from the skies nor would it rise from the deep.
('86', 147, 1, 4, 198053) If they wanted to get it from their own efforts, there was only one way.
('86', 147, 2, 5, 198126) Some people thought in terms of Parliament.
('86', 147, 2, 6, 198170) He did not want to utter its name.
('86', 147, 2, 7, 198205) He wanted to forget Parliament but to think only of the constructive programme.
('86', 147, 2, 8, 198285) An important item of this programme was Hindu Muslim unity.
('86', 147, 3, 9, 198345) Concluding, Gandhiji said: Freedom is in our hands.
('86', 147, 3, 10, 198397) When we breathe, we cannot take other people’s help.
('86', 147, 3, 11, 198450) If we resort to artificial methods of respiration, it means that we are on the brink of death.
('86', 147, 3, 12, 198545) Freedom is like our breath.Having lost it for a long time we do appreciate it.
('86', 147, 3, 13, 198624) But I know the nature of freedom.
('86', 147, 3, 14, 198658) I have fully experienced freedom.
('86', 147, 3, 15, 198692) And if you regard it as holy and worthy of achievement, this is the only way.

('86', 155, 7, 12, 207478) BOMBAY, April 8, 1945 2
('86', 155, 8, 13, 207502) In reply to the request of the deputationists for advice Gandhiji said: My advice in this matter may not be of much use as, with the exception of Abidally, I am not acquainted with any of you.
('86', 155, 8, 14, 207695) Nor have I any direct, intimate knowledge of the conditions in Bombay.
('86', 155, 8, 15, 207766) 1 would therefore say to you that you should consult such leaders as enjoy your confidence and are sound and you should do as they say.
('86', 155, 9, 16, 207902) Pressed by the deputationists to give a word of guidance on the strength of his own experience of strikes which he had led, Gandhiji observed: I have conducted many strikes.
('86', 155, 9, 17, 208076) I can, therefore, give you the conditions of a successful strike.
('86', 155, 9, 18, 208142) The first is that the cause should be clear and just.
('86', 155, 9, 19, 208196) Secondly, the strikers should be firm and not be afraid of starvation, physical assaults or even death.
('86', 155, 9, 20, 208300) Thirdly, they should never deviate from the path of truth and ahimsa in whatever they
('86', 155, 10, 21, 208386) 1 The B.E.S.T. workers had been on strike and had sought Gandhiji”s advice.
('86', 155, 10, 22, 208462) As it was Gandhiji”s silence day he gave his remarks in writing.
('86', 155, 10, 23, 208527) The report given here was contained in a statement issued by Pyarelal in view of the fact that the Press had earlier published an unauthorized translation.

('86', 156, 1, 2, 208752) might do.
('86', 156, 1, 3, 208762) Fourthly, the strikers should have public support behind them.
('86', 156, 1, 4, 208825) If you can satisfy all these four conditions you should stand firm, but if you fall short in any of these respects you should boldly retrace your steps.
('86', 156, 1, 5, 208978) I cannot give you further guidance.
('86', 156, 1, 6, 209014) The details are for you to decide.
('86', 156, 2, 7, 209049) In answer to their further request that he should address an appeal to the Directors of the Company, most of whom were Indians, Gandhiji said: It is not my practice to interfere in a matter with which I am not fully acquainted.
('86', 156, 2, 8, 209277) I do not even know who are on the Board of Directors.
('86', 156, 2, 9, 209331) If, as you say, the Board is composed predominantly of Indians your task ought to be easy.
('86', 156, 2, 10, 209422) My function ceases with the advice.
('86', 156, 2, 11, 209458) The time is perhaps past when I could lead strikes myself.
('86', 156, 2, 12, 209517) If you understand this limitation of mine you will save my time as wellas yours.
('86', 156, 2, 13, 209598) Time in your case is the very essence.
('86', 156, 2, 14, 209637) You have therefore to act promptly.
('86', 156, 2, 15, 209673) If you carefully ponder over what I have said you will find that I have told you everything.
('86', 156, 3, 16, 209766) The deputationists finally asked whether Gandhiji would not appeal to the public to support them.
('86', 156, 3, 17, 209864) Gandhiji replied: It is not my word but your conduct that can win for you public support.

('86', 156, 6, 21, 210027) GHANSHYAMDAS, Can you read my handwriting?
('86', 156, 6, 22, 210070) If you find it difficult, I shall in future dictate my letters.
('86', 156, 6, 23, 210134) Days pass and there is no time left for a heart to heart talk.
('86', 156, 6, 24, 210197) I shall, therefore, put down in writing what I have to say.
('86', 156, 6, 25, 210257) That way I should be able to have my say.
('86', 156, 6, 26, 210299) You can reply in a few words.
('86', 156, 6, 27, 210329) This does not, of course, mean that I am withdrawing what I have said.
('86', 156, 6, 28, 210400) I will not leave here till I have given you time but I do not wish to postpone what I have to say.
('86', 156, 6, 29, 210499) Profulla Babu said to me: “Krishnakumar and Madhav Prasad have now become so big that they could not even come to see me in my illness.
('86', 156, 6, 30, 210635) Formerly they did visit me occasionally and also asked me questions.” It seems to be a case of negligence.
('86', 156, 6, 31, 210742) There is no question here of big and small.

('86', 157, 1, 2, 210828) asked Profulla if I could bring this matter up.
('86', 157, 1, 3, 210876) 2. My work has increased.
('86', 157, 1, 4, 210902) My endeavour now is to see that no one expects any money from me and the institutions I have created become self supporting.
('86', 157, 1, 5, 211027) This will, of course, take some time and meanwhile I shall have to find money for them.
('86', 157, 1, 6, 211115) The institutions are All India Spinners’ Association, Village Industries Association, Nayee Talim, Hindustani Prachar and the Ashram.
('86', 157, 1, 7, 211249) The second, third, fourth and fifth need the money now.
('86', 157, 1, 8, 211305) So far as the fifth, the Ashram, is concerned it will never be self supporting.
('86', 157, 1, 9, 211385) I am doing my best of course.
('86', 157, 1, 10, 211415) The Ashram also includes the hospital.
('86', 157, 1, 11, 211454) The monetary provision for the hospital is separate.
('86', 157, 1, 12, 211507) Efforts are being made to secure funds for it from various sources.
('86', 157, 1, 13, 211575) Still the annual expenses of the Ashram alone are in the neighbourhood of Rs. 100,000. I am quotingthe figure from memory.
('86', 157, 1, 14, 211698) The Ashram is not in need of funds at present.
('86', 157, 1, 15, 211745) Rameshwardas 1 sends the needed money.
('86', 157, 1, 16, 211784) As for the second, third and fourth, they need the money.
('86', 157, 1, 17, 211842) I believe Rameshwardas has sent some money.
('86', 157, 1, 18, 211886) Money is needed for the propagation of Hindi and for Nayee Talim.
('86', 157, 1, 19, 211952) Probably I shall want Rs. 200,000. Are you disposed to take this burden on your shoulders?
('86', 157, 1, 20, 212043) As for the “Sufferers’ Fund” 2, Rameshwardas’s letter mentions it.
('86', 157, 1, 21, 212110) I have also given my opinion.
('86', 157, 1, 22, 212140) 3. Now for my relationship with women and my experiment.
('86', 157, 1, 23, 212197) I have suspended the experiment for the sake of co workers.
('86', 157, 1, 24, 212257) I did not see anything improper in it.
('86', 157, 1, 25, 212296) I am the same who took a vow of brahmacharya in 1906 and have been observing brahmacharya since 1901. Today I am a better brahmachari than I was in 1901. What my experiment has done is to make me more firm in my brahmacharya.
('86', 157, 1, 26, 212522) The experiment was designed to make of myself a perfect brahmachari?
('86', 157, 1, 27, 212591) and if God so wills it will lead to perfection.
('86', 157, 1, 28, 212639) You wanted to talk to me and question me on the subject.
('86', 157, 1, 29, 212696) You may do both.
('86', 157, 1, 30, 212713) Please do not hesitate.
('86', 157, 1, 31, 212737) It will be unbearable if there is any hesitation in one with whom I have such intimate relations and whose money I have been so freely spending.
('86', 157, 1, 32, 212882) It is good that two of your brothers are together.
('86', 157, 1, 33, 212933) This letter is certainly for both but you may take it that it is indeed for all the brothers and the entire family.

('86', 158, 1, 3, 213250) After all it covers three points.
('86', 158, 1, 4, 213284) I forgot to mention one thing.
('86', 158, 1, 5, 213315) You have given Rs. 50,000 for the Ashram land which has been transferred to the goshala.
('86', 158, 1, 6, 213404) Now the list that Chimanlal has sent mentions the Ashram field and some land with a well in it.
('86', 158, 1, 7, 213500) If that is so, then all the houses go too.
('86', 158, 1, 8, 213543) This cannot be so.
('86', 158, 1, 9, 213562) It must have been an oversight.
('86', 158, 1, 10, 213594) Though letters were sent to Janakidevi and others there was no result.
('86', 158, 1, 11, 213665) Now, if you think that the entire land with the well has been given to the goshala, then a certain amount will have to be deducted from your Rs. 50,000. Do what you think proper.

('86', 160, 8, 14, 215810) Q. Do you still hold that the Harijan problem is only religious and social and that it has no great political significance?
('86', 160, 9, 15, 215934) A. It has political significance but indirectly.
('86', 160, 10, 16, 215983) Q. The Congress as an organization has not taken up the Harijan work.
('86', 160, 10, 17, 216053) Will it not be better if that work is taken up by the Congress and not by the Harijan Sevak Sangh?
('86', 160, 11, 18, 216152) A. It is wrong to say that the Congress has not taken it up.
('86', 160, 12, 19, 216213) Q. But it seems that leaders like Jawaharlal and the Rashtrapati are not keenly aware of the Harijan question?
('86', 160, 13, 20, 216324) A. Those two are immersed in that work.
('86', 160, 14, 21, 216364) Q. The Harijan Sevak Sangh after years of work had not yet produced even a dozen leaders from among the Harijans themselves.
('86', 160, 15, 22, 216489) A. That charge is only partly true.
('86', 160, 16, 23, 216525) Q. All great men have a passion for simplification.

('86', 161, 1, 3, 216838) But in life, is not the conflict between one right and another right or between one truth and another truth?
('86', 161, 1, 4, 216947) How can non violence deal with such a situation?
('86', 161, 2, 5, 216996) A. That is a matter of application.
('86', 161, 3, 6, 217032) Q. In the Hindu Muslim question where the conflict is between the rights of the Hindus and the rights of the Muslims, what technique of non violence can be employed to solve the problem, especially when these rights seem to be irreconcilable?
('86', 161, 4, 7, 217275) A. That awful situation can only be dealt with properly through satyagraha.
('86', 161, 4, 8, 217351) Your questions show that you have not studied it.
('86', 161, 4, 9, 217401) If I am right, P[yarelal] will give you a list of the books.

('86', 161, 6, 12, 217634) A. He cannot serve the one without serving the other.
('86', 161, 6, 13, 217688) Abroad you will say it is a domestic question which you are determined to solve for yourselves.

('86', 162, 1, 2, 218237) 303. SPEECH AT BORIVLI CAMP 1
('86', 162, 2, 3, 218267) April 11, 1945
('86', 162, 3, 4, 218282) Gandhiji began his remarks by requesting them 2 to give him a little respite.
('86', 162, 3, 5, 218360) There was a time and place for everything in life, he told them.
('86', 162, 3, 6, 218425) He had trained himself to listen to the inner voice irrespective of his surroundings.
('86', 162, 3, 7, 218511) But in that he had succeeded only partially.
('86', 162, 3, 8, 218556) He could not keep himself absolutely unaffected by his surroundings.
('86', 162, 3, 9, 218625) Therefore he requested the photographers to spare him while he was trying to express his deepest feelings.
('86', 162, 3, 10, 218732) Photography out of time and place was not art but vulgarity.
('86', 162, 4, 11, 218793) Dealing with the question of prayer” he said that he had learnt that common prayers had been excluded from their routine lest anyone should feel that religion was being imposed upon her or him.
('86', 162, 4, 12, 218987) Speaking for himself” he could say that he could do and had often done without food for days on end, but he could not do without prayer even for a single day.
('86', 162, 4, 13, 219146) Individual prayer was there but no one should fight shy of collective prayer.
('86', 162, 4, 14, 219224) Man is a social being.
('86', 162, 4, 15, 219247) If men and women could eat together, play together and work together why should they not pray together?
('86', 162, 4, 16, 219351) Why should anyone feel the need to pray away from everybody’s gaze?
('86', 162, 4, 17, 219419) Was there anything sinful orshameful in prayer that it should not be said in public?
('86', 162, 4, 18, 219504) For close on fifty years he had been a believer in public prayer.
('86', 162, 4, 19, 219570) From his earliest days in South Africa he had among his associates and co workers men and women of every religion.
('86', 162, 4, 20, 219685) Hindus, Muslims, Christians and Parsis, all used to join him in prayer.
('86', 162, 4, 21, 219757) In India men and women in crowds attended his prayers wherever he went.
('86', 162, 4, 22, 219829) He had been told that they did not come to attend the prayers.
('86', 162, 4, 23, 219892) They came just to have his darshan.
('86', 162, 4, 24, 219928) Even if it was so, they came because they wanted to join him — a man of prayer.
('86', 162, 4, 25, 220008) He was aware that he had not come as near to God as he wanted to.
('86', 162, 4, 26, 220074) His realization of truth and ahimsa was still far from perfect, otherwise there would be no need for him to use speech.
('86', 162, 4, 27, 220194) His very being would radiate truth and ahimsa so that they would be able to see it on his face and feel its presence.
('86', 162, 4, 28, 220312) He had often said that the perfect ahimsa of one individual was quite enough for the whole world.
('86', 162, 4, 29, 220410) Whatever measure of success he had attained in the realization of truth and non violence was the result of prayer.
('86', 162, 5, 30, 220525) Prayer should be a spontaneous welling up of the heart.
('86', 162, 5, 31, 220581) One should not pray if one felt that prayer was a burden.
('86', 162, 5, 32, 220639) God was not hungry for man’s prayer or praise.
('86', 162, 5, 33, 220686) He tolerated all because He was all Love.
('86', 162, 5, 34, 220728) If they felt that they owed a debt to Him who is the Giver of all things” they should remember Him and pray to Him out of sheer
('86', 162, 6, 35, 220856) 1 The camp was organized by Mridula Sarabhai under the auspices of the Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Fund.
('86', 162, 6, 36, 220967) 2 The cameramen who had been clicking continuously
('86', 163, 0, 1, 221018) 164 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('86', 163, 1, 2, 221060) gratitude.
('86', 163, 1, 3, 221071) The fear of incurring anybody’s ridicule or displeasure should never deter one from performing one’s elementary duty towards the Maker.
('86', 163, 1, 4, 221207) To illustrate his remark he told them the story of Prophet Daniel.
('86', 163, 2, 5, 221274) Answering next Shrimati Mridulabehn’s question as to what were the good and bad points of Indians as a nation, he observed that he was convinced that in the sum the former far outweighed the latter.
('86', 163, 2, 6, 221473) Indians had many defects.
('86', 163, 2, 7, 221499) India was a slave country and her slavery dated much farther back than the British conquest of India.
('86', 163, 2, 8, 221601) Slavery of evil customs and superstitions” he knew, was the worst form of slavery.
('86', 163, 2, 9, 221684) Yet the solace that he could find in India he could find nowhere else.
('86', 163, 2, 10, 221755) He had lived in England and he had spent the best part of his life in South Africa.
('86', 163, 2, 11, 221839) Yet he could not adopt those countries as his home.
('86', 163, 2, 12, 221891) In reply to a friend’s query years ago” he had said that he wanted to die in the lap of his mother.
('86', 163, 2, 13, 221991) His own mother, who was a frail little woman, had died years ago.
('86', 163, 2, 14, 222057) But Mother India with her 80 crores of hands 80 crores of feet and 40 crores of mouths had beckoned to him from across the seas and he could not resist that call.
('86', 163, 3, 15, 222220) What did it matter if that venerable mother appeared sick and paralysed today?
('86', 163, 3, 16, 222299) It was not for him to proclaim India’s virtues.
('86', 163, 3, 17, 222347) As for her shortcomings he had been proclaiming them from the house tops ever since his return to India.
('86', 163, 3, 18, 222452) But if he were pressed to name only one shortcoming of Indians he would say that the worst was cowardice.
('86', 163, 4, 19, 222558) Another friend asked how women could go into the villages and work under the Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Fund scheme handicapped as they wereby so many restrictions.
('86', 163, 4, 20, 222730) Gandhiji’s reply was that he had expected that their first lesson in the camp was to learn to break all social restrictions that cramped or degraded them.
('86', 163, 4, 21, 222885) He, however, warned them that this did not mean throwing off of all moral restraints.
('86', 163, 4, 22, 222971) There was at present a woeful deterioration of moral standards in society among men.
('86', 163, 4, 23, 223056) Even those who talked loudly about enforcing monogamy through law did not practise it themselves.
('86', 163, 4, 24, 223154) The same tendency was beginning to manifest itself among women.
('86', 163, 4, 25, 223218) He had known educated girls who thought nothing of marrying men having a living wife.
('86', 163, 4, 26, 223304) He called this degradation of womanhood.
('86', 163, 4, 27, 223345) Such views could not be defended under the pretence of banishing social superstitions or vice.
('86', 163, 4, 28, 223440) Did the emancipation of women mean that they should imitate men in that respect?
('86', 163, 4, 29, 223521) Certainly not.
('86', 163, 4, 30, 223536) India could never win swaraj, certainly not the swaraj of his conception, by following that path.
('86', 163, 5, 31, 223634) Uttermost moral purity was the first requisite for establishing social freedom.
('86', 163, 5, 32, 223714) No one who lacked moral purity was qualified to lead a crusade against evil social restrictions.
('86', 163, 6, 33, 223811) The next question was how they were to deal with the question of untouchability in the villages.
('86', 163, 6, 34, 223908) He agreed that the problem of untouchability in the
('86', 164, 0, 1, 223960) VOL. 86 : 4 MARCH, 1945 28 MAY, 1945 165
('86', 164, 1, 2, 224001) villages was very acute.
('86', 164, 1, 3, 224026) But those who went there should go with the grim determination to destroy it root and branch or perish in the attempt.
('86', 164, 1, 4, 224145) They should begin with the scavengers.
('86', 164, 1, 5, 224184) Unfortunately, there was untouchability even among the so called untouchables.
('86', 164, 1, 6, 224263) They should mix with them and eat and drink with them, provided they observed the rules of cleanliness and sanitation.
('86', 164, 1, 7, 224382) They could inculcate these habits upon them by cooking for them and cleaning up their homes for them.
('86', 164, 2, 8, 224484) Another question expressed the fear that since capitalists had contributed the bulk of the Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Fund and since they were taken on committees their influence would dominate the organization and vitiate it.
('86', 164, 3, 9, 224718) Gandhiji dismissed the apprehension as groundless.
('86', 164, 3, 10, 224769) He maintained that in endorsing the acceptance of donations of the rich he had not in any way accepted their dictation nor did they seek or expect any such thing from him.
('86', 164, 3, 11, 224941) Moneyed men were in a majority only in the Board of Trustees, but that did not mean that they dominated or wanted to dominate the organization.
('86', 164, 3, 12, 225085) In fact they had offered voluntarily to retire from the Board after the fund had been collected and would have gladly done so had he expressed such a desire.
('86', 164, 3, 13, 225243) But he wanted not only their donations but their talent” goodwill and services for the cause and so they continued to be on the Board.
('86', 164, 4, 14, 225378) He refused to believe that the capitalists were necessarily a bad lot or worse than members of any other class.
('86', 164, 4, 15, 225490) In this world everyone was imperfect.
('86', 164, 4, 16, 225528) He was too well aware of his own imperfections to presume to judge others.
('86', 164, 4, 17, 225603) His ahimsa required him to be rigorous in viewing his own shortcomings but to be charitable in judging others.
('86', 164, 4, 18, 225714) It was enough if he could eradicate his own.
('86', 164, 4, 19, 225759) If, therefore, instead of cavillingat the faults of others we turned the searchlight inward and concentrated on self purification, the world would become a better place to live in and the general social purification would be reflected in the capitalist class too.
('86', 164, 4, 20, 226023) He could not therefore say to the capitalists that unless they renounced all their riches he would have nothing to do with them.
('86', 164, 4, 21, 226152) Complete renunciation of one’s possessions was a thing which very few even among the ordinary folk were capable of.
('86', 164, 4, 22, 226268) All that one could legitimately expect of the wealthy class was to hold their riches in trust and use them for the service of society.
('86', 164, 4, 23, 226403) To insist upon more would be to kill the goose that laid the golden eggs.

('86', 165, 2, 3, 226581) BORIVLI, April 11, 1945
('86', 165, 3, 4, 226605) Gandhiji said he was reminded by Balasaheb Kher that he had visited Borivli after twenty years.
('86', 165, 3, 5, 226701) He did not think it was such a long time.
('86', 165, 3, 6, 226743) He was glad to be able to renew their acquaintance after such a long period.
('86', 165, 3, 7, 226820) On them rested a great responsibility owing to Shrimati Mridulabehn’s shibir in their midst.
('86', 165, 3, 8, 226913) They should interest themselves in it.
('86', 165, 3, 9, 226952) He then turned to Khan Saheb and said, if he was to be friends with Khan Saheb was he to expect him to learn Sanskritized Hindi or was he, the speaker, bound to speak and write to him in Urdu?
('86', 165, 3, 10, 227145) But Khan Saheb was everyone’s friend.
('86', 165, 3, 11, 227183) Therefore it was the duty of the audience to learn the national language in both the forms and both scripts.
('86', 165, 3, 12, 227292) Thus and thus alone could the All India language permeate the whole of India.
('86', 165, 3, 13, 227370) In this at least there should be no Pakistan and he who wished to make common cause with Hindus and Muslims was bound to learn the two scripts and two forms.
('86', 165, 3, 14, 227528) A time would then come when the two forms of speech would become one.
('86', 165, 3, 15, 227598) If they felt it a burden to learn the scripts, he could only say swaraj was not to be had easily and without toil.
('86', 165, 3, 16, 227713) Where there was love toil was no trouble but pleasure.
('86', 165, 4, 17, 227768) The speaker then alluded to the evening bhajan sung at the prayer.
('86', 165, 4, 18, 227835) Its burden was that the way to God was for the valiant, not for the timid.
('86', 165, 4, 19, 227910) But God was not to be reached by slaves.
('86', 165, 4, 20, 227951) Therefore the bhajan was also for those who wanted to throw off their slavery.
('86', 165, 5, 21, 228030) The speaker then concluded that slavery must be the lot of those who hugged untouchability and that too in the name of religion.
('86', 165, 5, 22, 228159) He wanted therefore to repeat what he had said so often, namely, that Hinduism must perish if untouchability lived.

('86', 166, 3, 5, 228500) It is perhaps shameful on my part to exile myself for three months for coolness’ sake.
('86', 166, 3, 6, 228587) My consolation is that they have all driven me out.
('86', 166, 3, 7, 228639) But very little temptation will hurl me back to Sevagram.
('86', 166, 3, 8, 228697) You should convert the people there to your view.
('86', 166, 3, 9, 228747) I did try.

('86', 167, 6, 10, 229883) CHIMANLAL, I have your letter.
('86', 167, 6, 11, 229914) I have a little leisure today.
('86', 167, 6, 12, 229945) If I were you I would be considerate enough to keep Sarojini with me and strict enough to recover every pie from her and make her eat in the kitchen regularly.
('86', 167, 6, 13, 230105) 2 If that should make her want to leave I would let here leave.
('86', 167, 6, 14, 230169) But do whatever seems proper to you.
('86', 167, 6, 15, 230206) From this distance I can only give you advice.
('86', 167, 6, 16, 230253) It is Ramprasad’s duty to go to Mirabehn.
('86', 167, 6, 17, 230295) The work there is light, the air is good and he will be there only for two months.
('86', 167, 6, 18, 230378) If he does not go let him do whatever he likes.
('86', 167, 6, 19, 230426) The problem of the Ashram land has been solved.
('86', 167, 6, 20, 230474) Ghanshyamdas does not want the money back.
('86', 167, 6, 21, 230517) Jajuji has decided that since the land which you did not want to give would not be given, Ghanshyamdas could deduct something if he so desired.
('86', 167, 6, 22, 230661) He does not want to deduct anything.
('86', 167, 6, 23, 230698) So that work is over.
('86', 167, 6, 24, 230720) I enclose Dr. Ice’s letter.
('86', 167, 6, 25, 230748) We should build a house for him as he asks.
('86', 167, 6, 26, 230792) Consider all the changes he wants to make for us.
('86', 167, 6, 27, 230842) I feel that if we can have some relief from heat by building a suitable house, we should do that.

('86', 168, 6, 15, 231715) However, if they are propagated in their Western garb in Indian villages they are more likely to prove useless and might even prove harmful, because in that garb they will be too expensive for Indian villages and ill adapted to the village atmosphere.
('86', 168, 6, 16, 231967) It is possible the cities may not feel the expense so much and women influenced by Western ways may be receptive to the ideas presented in Western garb; but even so it will be of no use because India lives not in cities but in its seven lakh villages.
('86', 168, 6, 17, 232219) Besides, scientific education with Western trappings might prove poisonous to the city dwellers because here education begins the moment the child is conceived and ends no one knows when.
('86', 168, 6, 18, 232407) These days the cities are created by the foreigners toserve their ends and so they do not represent the villages.
('86', 168, 6, 19, 232521) They do not protect the interests of the villagers but are becoming their exploiters.

('86', 169, 8, 17, 233423) There is no mention in it of my suggestion.
('86', 169, 8, 18, 233467) It could not be that you have not received it, because Chi.
('86', 169, 8, 19, 233527) Chimanlal writes that you would not like to go to Mirabehn.
('86', 169, 8, 20, 233587) How is that?
('86', 169, 8, 21, 233600) It is work you like and the place is also cool.
('86', 169, 8, 22, 233648) Can you get what you desire if you are notwilling to go?

('86', 170, 8, 15, 234388) The importance of Nayee Talim is that we become teachers of all.
('86', 170, 8, 16, 234453) However one who does not also become a student is not fit to be a teacher.
('86', 170, 8, 17, 234528) Being a student one daily learns something new.
('86', 170, 8, 18, 234576) You should not be afraid of anyone.
('86', 170, 8, 19, 234612) You will win over everyone by ahimsa.
('86', 170, 8, 20, 234650) The heat there is stifling.
('86', 170, 8, 21, 234678) You have to overcome that also.
('86', 170, 8, 22, 234710) Everyone cannot go to a cool place.
('86', 170, 8, 23, 234746) You must make that place itself as cool as you can.
('86', 170, 8, 24, 234798) Take Dr. Kelkar’s help.
('86', 170, 8, 25, 234822) He is a nice man and he has written to me about this.

('86', 173, 8, 20, 237837) He was close to my father.

('86', 175, 2, 3, 239344) April 15, 1945 I am sorry to say that what appears to have been meant as a supplement to the constructive programme is its flat contradiction.
('86', 175, 2, 4, 239487) And it is unworkable.
('86', 175, 2, 5, 239509) If put in action, it will [not only] frustrate itself but will largely hamper the constructive programme.
('86', 175, 2, 6, 239615) But this is merely a caution.
('86', 175, 2, 7, 239645) Those who believe in this programme must prosecute it till they are convinced to the contrary.
('86', 175, 2, 8, 239740) That is the best argument.
('86', 175, 2, 9, 239767) Hence I do not want to reason even if I had the time which I have not just now.

('86', 177, 7, 12, 242008) April 15, 1945 In my view the question is not difficult.
('86', 177, 7, 13, 242065) I shall define the ideal.
('86', 177, 7, 14, 242091) It is for each individual to decide how far it is proper to depart from it.
('86', 177, 7, 15, 242167) Consider also that my own conduct is not in keeping with the ideal I lay down.
('86', 177, 7, 16, 242246) My coming here and then going to Mahabaleshwar is a breach of the ideal.
('86', 177, 7, 17, 242319) Even so, that is what I am doing.
('86', 177, 7, 18, 242353) You are similarly free to act as you wish.
('86', 177, 7, 19, 242396) If the heart is inclined in a certain way the ideal is secondary.
('86', 177, 7, 20, 242462) Let us do without what everyone cannot have.
('86', 177, 7, 21, 242507) I have told you that in practice we do not do it.
('86', 177, 7, 22, 242557) Now you have to decide without hesitation whether or not you should take help from Saroj or Raihana or Kamalnayan.
('86', 177, 7, 23, 242672) Neither I nor anybody else should take that decision.

('86', 178, 3, 5, 243148) After all he is here for six months.
('86', 178, 3, 6, 243185) Isn’t he?
('86', 178, 3, 7, 243195) Pyarelal needs all the rooms.
('86', 178, 3, 8, 243225) He has a lot of papers and books.

('86', 178, 7, 13, 243391) OM 1, If you keep your clothes in the room on getting up, does it mean the room is yours?
('86', 178, 7, 14, 243481) The ideal thing would be that we consider it more than enough if we have a corner to keep our things in.
('86', 178, 7, 15, 243586) Do you throw your clothes about anyhow or do you fold them and keep them neatly arranged?
('86', 178, 7, 16, 243676) Do you wash your mouth and face before going to the morning prayer?
('86', 178, 7, 17, 243744) You have described the schedule from lunch to 3.15 p.m.
('86', 178, 7, 18, 243800) as cleaning and ginning of cotton, newspaper reading and writing.
('86', 178, 7, 19, 243866) You ought to mention specifically the time each activity takes.
('86', 178, 7, 20, 243930) Working eight hours is compulsory.
('86', 178, 7, 21, 243965) In an institution given to non violence, taking work from others is coercion.
('86', 178, 7, 22, 244043) Why should we exact work?
('86', 178, 7, 23, 244069) Everything we do is work.
('86', 178, 7, 24, 244095) We should not keep our diaries secret.
('86', 178, 7, 25, 244134) It is our ideal not to keep anything secret.
('86', 178, 7, 26, 244179) It is better to get the diary signed by the manager.
('86', 178, 7, 27, 244232) Any work given to us is our study, or should be.
('86', 178, 7, 28, 244281) Shriman Narayan’s school should not have English.
('86', 178, 7, 29, 244331) It will be discontinued.
('86', 178, 7, 30, 244356) I do not know the price.
('86', 178, 7, 31, 244381) You must find out.
('86', 178, 7, 32, 244400) Do not send the diary to me.
('86', 178, 7, 33, 244429) Show it to me when I come.

('86', 180, 2, 3, 245339) BOMBAY, April 15, 1945
('86', 180, 3, 4, 245362) Gandhiji wanted to refer to a conversation he had with a friend.
('86', 180, 3, 5, 245427) He was asked to define who was a Gandhi ite as there was confusion in the public mind.
('86', 180, 3, 6, 245514) He could safely say there was no Gandhi ite in India.
('86', 180, 3, 7, 245568) He was himself not one.
('86', 180, 3, 8, 245592) He had founded no cult.
('86', 180, 3, 9, 245616) He claimed to be a satyagrahi and” therefore, he was also non violent, or was trying to be and he invited everyone in the audience to do likewise.
('86', 180, 4, 10, 245763) When the odds were heavy against them in South Africa, where they were in a hopeless minority, he had discovered satyagraha in 1906 in the place of parliamentary programme.
('86', 180, 4, 11, 245936) He had never been a member of any parliament or even a local board.
('86', 180, 4, 12, 246004) He saw that non violent non co operation was the most powerful thing instead.
('86', 180, 4, 13, 246082) The constructive part was his 15 point programme which they had seen.
('86', 180, 4, 14, 246152) There was swaraj in it and much more.
('86', 180, 5, 15, 246190) Satyagraha was not a mere policy with him, it was his creed.
('86', 180, 5, 16, 246251) He hoped to see God face to face through it.
('86', 180, 5, 17, 246296) If that was the power of satyagraha surely political swaraj was a simple matter if all took to it.
('86', 180, 6, 18, 246395) But his satyagraha told him that he was to bear with those who did not see eye to eye with him but sought to go through the parliamentary programme.
('86', 180, 6, 19, 246544) They had known him closeted with Dr. Khan Saheb and his friends as also with Advocate Bhulabhai Desai.
('86', 180, 6, 20, 246647) He told them to follow their belief.
('86', 180, 6, 21, 246684) He owned no enemy—certainly not Englishmen and not even English officials.
('86', 180, 6, 22, 246759) But that did not mean that he should follow them.
('86', 180, 6, 23, 246809) He went his own way.
('86', 180, 6, 24, 246830) The official way was to rule India, his was to serve India.
('86', 180, 6, 25, 246890) The official was all for power, he was all for service and that in the name of God.
('86', 180, 6, 26, 246974) Therefore he could afford to face the whole world’s opposition, for God, he believed, was with him and He was a never failing, all sufficing companion and infallible Guide.

('86', 181, 2, 3, 247249) [April 16, 1945] 2
('86', 181, 3, 4, 247268) Instead of undertaking the thankless task of going through the jumble of my writings to find out what I have said or have not said about caste, you have done well in sending me the following questions.
('86', 181, 4, 5, 247470) 1. Do you still adhere to the views you have expressed on the caste system in your writings?
('86', 181, 5, 6, 247563) 2. Do you still believe that the caste system is the best social order and that the world should adopt it?
('86', 181, 6, 7, 247670) 3. Do you still believe that the thousands of existing sub castes will disappear and merge so that in the end only the four varnas will remain?
('86', 181, 6, 8, 247814) In the last twenty five years how many sub castes have thus disappeared and merged into bigger castes?
('86', 181, 7, 9, 247917) 4. Whatever castes we find in history are all based on birth and the inequalities arising therefrom.
('86', 181, 7, 10, 248018) Do you think that the equality and brotherhood you preach is consistent with that kind of social order?
('86', 181, 7, 11, 248122) If the Bhangis go on doing the work of scavenging from one generation to the next, what will be their future?
('86', 181, 8, 12, 248232) 5. Isn’t Shri Sanjana’s severe criticism of the “Politics of the Cow”’ entirely true?
('86', 181, 9, 13, 248318) 6. Will you give your consent to the bill introduced in the Central Legislature for retaining caste differences in the Hindu Law?
('86', 181, 10, 14, 248448) 7. “The Congress is an orthodox Hindu organization and under the fostering care of Gandhiji it has become a missionary organization for the renewal and well being of the orthodox Hindu religion with its caste system.” What reply would you give to such allegations of Shri Sanjana?
('86', 181, 10, 15, 248729) And if what Shri Sanjana says is correct, does it not repudiate the Congress claim of being a truly national organization?
('86', 181, 11, 16, 248852) 8. Is the caste system consistent with democracy and democratic organizations?
('86', 181, 11, 17, 248931) I do not need to refer to my past writings to say what I believe
('86', 181, 12, 18, 248996) 1 The questions had been submitted to Gandhiji by a correspondent and included quotations from Gandhiji’s writings.
('86', 181, 12, 19, 249112) Gandhiji, in answering, summarized these.
('86', 181, 12, 20, 249154) Later the questions and the answers were published by Navajivan as a preface to Varnavyavastha.
('86', 181, 12, 21, 249250) These were also published in The Bombay Chronicle and The Hindu.

('86', 182, 1, 2, 249395) today, because only what I believe today counts.
('86', 182, 1, 3, 249444) I wish to say that the caste system as it exists to day in Hinduism is an anachronism.
('86', 182, 1, 4, 249531) It is one of those ugly things which will certainly hinder the growth of true religion.
('86', 182, 1, 5, 249619) It must go if both Hinduism and India are to live and grow from day today.
('86', 182, 1, 6, 249694) The way to do it is for all Hindus to become their own scavengers and treat the so called hereditary Bhangis as their own brothers.
('86', 182, 1, 7, 249826) I say the Bhangis because they are at the lowest rung of the ladder.
('86', 182, 1, 8, 249895) This answers all the questions and I need say nothing more.
('86', 182, 1, 9, 249955) It is evident that the questioner has not taken the trouble to read my writings.
('86', 182, 1, 10, 250036) 1 Everybody knows that the Congress from its inception has not been and is not even now an orthodox Hindu organization.
('86', 182, 1, 11, 250156) It is a democratic organization comprising people holding different views and is daily becoming more and more so under my fostering care.

('86', 185, 3, 8, 253080) Do not go on discussing things.
('86', 185, 3, 9, 253112) The President after listening to everything should decide either through consensus or a majority vote or at his own discretion.

('86', 187, 7, 12, 255225) BOMBAY, April 17, 1945 Though I know that silence is better than the spoken or written word, there are well defined limitations to the application of the maxim.
('86', 187, 7, 13, 255386) The San Francisco Conference is announced to meet shortly.
('86', 187, 8, 14, 255445) I do not know its agenda.
('86', 187, 8, 15, 255471) Probably no outsider knows it.
('86', 187, 8, 16, 255502) Whatever it may be, the Conference will have much to do with the world to be after the so called end of the war.
('86', 187, 8, 17, 255615) I very much fear that behind the structure of world security sought to be raised lurk mistrust and fear which breed war.
('86', 187, 8, 18, 255736) Therefore as a lifelong believer in peace as against war, it seems well for me to record my convictions in the matter.
('86', 187, 8, 19, 255855) I reiterate my conviction that there will be no peace for the Allies or the world unless they shed their belief in the efficacy of war and its accompanying terrible deception and fraud and are determined to hammer out real peace based on freedom and equality of all races and nations.
('86', 187, 8, 20, 256140) Exploitation and domination of one nationover another can have no place in a world striving to put an end
('86', 187, 9, 21, 256246) 1 The Conference was convened on April 25 and concluded on June 26 when the Charter of the United Nations was finally adopted.
('86', 188, 0, 1, 256373) VOL. 86 : 4 MARCH, 1945 28 MAY, 1945 189
('86', 188, 1, 2, 256414) to all wars.
('86', 188, 1, 3, 256427) It is only in such a world that the militarily weaker nations will be free from the fear of intimidation or exploitation.
('86', 188, 1, 4, 256549) (1) An indispensable preliminary to peace is the complete freedom of India from all foreign control, not merely because it is a classic example of imperialist domination but specially because it is a big, ancient and cultured country which has fought for its freedom since 1920 deliberately with Truth and Nonviolence as its only weapon.
('86', 188, 1, 5, 256887) Though the Indian soldier has fought not for India’s freedom, he has shown during this war as never before that he is at least an equal of the best in his fighting qualities.
('86', 188, 1, 6, 257062) I cite this to answer the charge that India’s peaceful struggle is due to its lack of soldierly quality.
('86', 188, 1, 7, 257167) The inevitable deduction that is drawn from this is that non violence of the strong is infinitely braver than their violence.
('86', 188, 1, 8, 257293) That India may not yet have evolved such non violence is another matter.
('86', 188, 1, 9, 257366) If it is the case, it does not detract from the statement that it has battled non violently for freedom and that not without considerable success.
('86', 188, 1, 10, 257513) (2) Freedom of India will demonstrate to all the exploited races of the earth that their freedom is very near and that in no case will they henceforth be exploited.
('86', 188, 1, 11, 257678) (3) Peace must be just.
('86', 188, 1, 12, 257702) In order to be that, it must neither be punitive nor vindictive.
('86', 188, 1, 13, 257767) Germany and Japan should not be humiliated.
('86', 188, 1, 14, 257811) The strong are never vindictive.
('86', 188, 1, 15, 257844) Therefore, fruits of peace must be equally shared.
('86', 188, 1, 16, 257895) The effort then will be to turn them into friends.
('86', 188, 1, 17, 257946) The Allies can prove their democracy by no other means.
('86', 188, 1, 18, 258002) (4) It follows from the foregoing that there will be no armed peace imposed upon the forcibly disarmed.
('86', 188, 1, 19, 258106) All will be disarmed.
('86', 188, 1, 20, 258128) There will be an international police force to enforce the lightest terms of peace.
('86', 188, 1, 21, 258212) Even this retention of an international police will be a concession to human weakness, not by any means an emblem of peace If these foregoing essentials of peace are accepted, it follows that the camouflage of Indian representation through Indians nominated by British imperialism should be dropped.
('86', 188, 1, 22, 258512) 1 Such representation will be worse than no representation.
('86', 188, 1, 23, 258572) Either India at SanFrancisco is represented by an elected representative or represented not at all.
('86', 188, 2, 24, 258672) 1 The British Government had nominated A. Ramaswamy Mudaliar, Firoz Khan Noon and V. T. Krishnamachari to represent India at the Conference.
('86', 189, 0, 1, 258813) 190 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('86', 189, 1, 2, 258855) The following from the Congress resolution of August 8, 1942, shows clearly what free India stands for:
('86', 189, 2, 3, 258959) While the A.I.C.C. must primarily be concerned with the independence and defence of India in this hour of danger, the Committee is of opinion that the future peace, security and ordered progress of the world demand a world federation of free nations, and on no other basis can the problems of the modern world be solved.
('86', 189, 2, 4, 259280) Such a world federation would ensure the freedom of its constituent nations, the prevention of aggression and exploitation by one nation over another, the protection of national minorities, the advancement of all backward areas and peoples, and the pooling of the world’s resources for the common good of all.
('86', 189, 2, 5, 259590) On the establishment of such a world federation, disarmament would be practicable in all countries, national armies, navies and air forces would no longer be necessary, and a world federal defence force would keep the world peace and prevent aggression.
('86', 189, 2, 6, 259844) An independent India would gladly join such a world federation and co operate on an equal basis with other countries in the solution of international problems.
('86', 189, 2, 7, 260004) Thus the demand for Indian independence is in no way selfish.
('86', 189, 2, 8, 260066) Its nationalism spells internationalism.

('86', 189, 4, 11, 260181) BOMBAY, April 18, 1945 As India holds the key to the freedom of all the exploited races and nations of the earth so do Indians in South Africa hold the key to the protection and freedom of the exploited people in the overseas.
('86', 189, 4, 12, 260408) For it was in South Africa that satyagraha was fairly tried and became largely successful.
('86', 189, 4, 13, 260499) Will the Indians there unite and sacrifice themselves for the common cause?

('86', 189, 7, 16, 260616) 1 The message was conveyed through J. R. Bhala, Joint Secretary of the Overseas Indian Students’ Association, who had met Gandhiji and acquainted him with the difficulties facing the overseas students.

('86', 190, 3, 4, 261006) CHIMANLAL, Sushilabehn tells me that there is an understanding with Jajuji and the others that, apart from diagnosis and general treatment, the expenses on patent medicines should be borne by the patients themselves.
('86', 190, 3, 5, 261223) They should not be purchased by the Hospital but should be procured by the patients as per the prescription.
('86', 190, 3, 6, 261332) According to this arrangement, the cost of the distilled water should be recovered from those patients to whom it is given or the Ashram should pay if it wants.
('86', 190, 3, 7, 261493) This is a matter of keeping accounts.
('86', 190, 3, 8, 261531) Sushilabehn intends to make the Hospital self reliant.
('86', 190, 3, 9, 261586) It seems that the water is being distilled for Hari ichchha, Kishorelalbhai and others.
('86', 190, 3, 10, 261674) We cannot take money from them, so it seems to me that the expenses should be put in the Ashram account.

('86', 193, 5, 11, 265235) April 19, 1945 I have read this.
('86', 193, 5, 12, 265268) It is good.

('86', 193, 5, 14, 265310) If I did, I might make some suggestions, but I will not attempt that.

('86', 193, 5, 20, 265683) It may mean that they also should be taught.
('86', 193, 5, 21, 265728) Illiterates are in large number—they are in millions.
('86', 193, 5, 22, 265782) They can be taught the Nagari script because it is a perfect one.
('86', 193, 5, 23, 265848) That means that there will be one script for the languages descended from Sanskrit.
('86', 193, 5, 24, 265932) Everybody would write his mother tongue also in that script.
('86', 193, 5, 25, 265993) Let there be mother tongue—the mother script is unnecessary.
('86', 193, 5, 26, 266054) The national language should be written in two scripts as long as the dispute is not settled.
('86', 193, 5, 27, 266148) In words of non Arabic and non Persian origin, only one and some other letters may be used.
('86', 193, 5, 28, 266240) I shall not write more.

('86', 195, 8, 19, 268192) BHAI TANDONJI, I am a little unhappy over yesterday’s discussion.
('86', 195, 8, 20, 268258) I wonder if I have wasted your time.
('86', 195, 8, 21, 268295) Then again I could not explain to you a very simple thing.
('86', 195, 8, 22, 268354) I had made it clear at Indore that Hindi did not mean exclusion of Urdu.
('86', 195, 8, 23, 268427) You yourself do not want to give up Urdu.
('86', 195, 8, 24, 268469) Then it becomes your duty and mine—and of other patriots also—to know both the scripts and their styles.
('86', 195, 8, 25, 268574) We include Urdu knowing people in taking account of the supporters of the national language.
('86', 195, 8, 26, 268667) Therefore the national language is=Hindi + Urdu.
('86', 195, 8, 27, 268716) Hindi will be an incomplete national language if we take it in its narrow sense.
('86', 195, 8, 28, 268797) Those imbued with nationalism will easily learn two more languages.
('86', 195, 8, 29, 268865) Those who do not will lag behind.
('86', 195, 8, 30, 268899) Such being my views, I will popularize Hindustani whether others support me or not.

('86', 198, 3, 4, 271365) Gandhiji spoke of the value of prayer and asked the audience to continue the habit even after he was gone.
('86', 198, 3, 5, 271472) In particular he asked them to pray that the taint of untouchability might be removed root and branch and find no place in their hearts.
('86', 198, 4, 6, 271609) But he reminded them also that it was not enough if they prayed.
('86', 198, 4, 7, 271674) While everything ultimately depended on the will of God they must do their duty.
('86', 198, 4, 8, 271755) In the 15 point constructive programme which he had set out before them was hidden the key to swaraj.
('86', 198, 4, 9, 271857) If a large majority of them pursued this programme sincerely he was confident that their efforts would be crowned with success.

('86', 209, 3, 7, 284608) The necessary literature for that purpose should be collected.
('86', 209, 3, 8, 284671) There is no truth as regards the bullocks.

('86', 212, 10, 15, 288176) BHAI RAMANLAL,
('86', 212, 11, 16, 288191) I have gone through your letter.
('86', 212, 11, 17, 288224) Please let me know what harm is caused by the eating of lemons and tomatoes.
('86', 212, 11, 18, 288301) I have taken these in large quantities and made others do so.
('86', 212, 11, 19, 288363) I have noticed no harm.
('86', 212, 11, 20, 288387) I take plenty of fruit.
('86', 212, 11, 21, 288411) I have observed no ill effects from it.
('86', 212, 11, 22, 288451) Let me know why one should not take fruit.
('86', 212, 11, 23, 288494) I would like to take less fruit and more vegetables because the latter are cheaper.
('86', 212, 11, 24, 288578) Have you tried pumpkin seeds?
('86', 212, 11, 25, 288608) If that remedy should work, I would consider it very good and it is also cheap.
('86', 212, 11, 26, 288688) What can you say from your experience?
('86', 212, 11, 27, 288727) The impression Dr. Mehta has formed of you is that you have read a great deal but seem to have no experience.
('86', 212, 11, 28, 288837) I understand that you are busy translating Lindbar’s book.
('86', 212, 11, 29, 288896) It would be better if you gained some experience either under Dr. Dinshaw or, if you can put up with the heat, at Sevagram, where you

('86', 213, 6, 13, 289598) Why then should I have you at Mahabaleshwar ?
('86', 213, 6, 14, 289644) There was a reason for sending you to hospital.
('86', 213, 6, 15, 289692) You say I am everything to you, yet you are unable to understand me.
('86', 213, 6, 16, 289761) One would surely understand the person one regarded both as mother and father.
('86', 213, 6, 17, 289840) One would not argue with him.
('86', 213, 6, 18, 289870) Whatever he said would go straight to one’s heart.
('86', 213, 6, 19, 289921) But what can I do when you remain untouched even after persuasion ?
('86', 213, 6, 20, 289989) What kind of a person are you that you hesitate to go to Shantikumar’s 1 place ?

('86', 214, 3, 7, 290514) You will never fall ill if you follow the rules of health.

('86', 218, 3, 4, 294273) RAMESHWARI, I have some respite here at any rate.
('86', 218, 3, 5, 294323) So I am attending to the letters lying unanswered.
('86', 218, 3, 6, 294374) One of the letters is from the Kauls.
('86', 218, 3, 7, 294412) They have sent Rs. 1000 for the work Raja Saheb had mentioned in his letter to Dr. Mahmud.
('86', 218, 3, 8, 294503) I do not now wish to issue an appeal about it.
('86', 218, 3, 9, 294550) I do approve of such memorials, but the beginning should be made with the Punjab.
('86', 218, 3, 10, 294632) I do not share Raja Saheb’s view that it is possible to collect one crore for the Hindu Muslim work.
('86', 218, 3, 11, 294733) Even so, a decent amount can be collected if an appeal is issued.
('86', 218, 3, 12, 294799) You say that a large number of Muslims had attended the funeral.
('86', 218, 3, 13, 294864) Will they do some work?
('86', 218, 3, 14, 294888) Can you give your view?
('86', 218, 3, 15, 294912) You are not the one to desist because Raja Saheb was your father.
('86', 218, 3, 16, 294978) You are objective enough to consider the matter and give your opinion.
('86', 218, 3, 17, 295049) I shall be here for a month.

('86', 218, 7, 24, 295383) Cut the hair of girls and even grown up women if they are agreeable.
('86', 218, 7, 25, 295452) It will save a lot of time.
('86', 218, 7, 26, 295480) It does not spoil the face at all.

('86', 221, 3, 4, 297681) In your place I would not submit even if I were to die.
('86', 221, 3, 5, 297737) 2 But there is no one law for everyone.
('86', 221, 3, 6, 297777) You should act solely according to your capacity.
('86', 221, 3, 7, 297827) In any event seeing that you did not accept the notice, you should inform the authorities that you would not accept restrictions save of your own conscience and that you fully believed in non violence and truth.

('86', 221, 5, 10, 298106) [Before April 25, 1945] 4
('86', 221, 6, 11, 298132) RALPH CONISTON: Why do you feel so sceptical about the possibility of a lasting peace emerging from the defeat of the Axis Powers?
('86', 221, 7, 12, 298263) GANDHIJI: The reason is patent.
('86', 221, 7, 13, 298295) Violence is bound sooner or later to exhaust itself but peace cannot issue out of such exhaustion.
('86', 221, 7, 14, 298394) I am uttering God’s truth when I say that unless there is a return to sanity, violent people will be swept off the face of the earth .
('86', 221, 7, 15, 298529) Those who have their hands dyed deep in blood cannot build a non violent order for the world.
('86', 221, 8, 16, 298623) R. C. While the representatives of the big powers who would be meeting at San Francisco were what they were, the people at large, after the experience of the horrors of war, would force the hands of their respective Governments.
('86', 221, 9, 17, 298852) G. I know the European mind well enough to know that when it has to choose between abstract justice and self interest, it will plump for the latter.
('86', 221, 9, 18, 299001) The man in the street even in America does not think much for himself.
('86', 221, 9, 19, 299072) He will put faith in what Roosevelt says.
('86', 221, 9, 20, 299114) Rooseveltgives him market, credit and all that.
('86', 221, 9, 21, 299162) Similarly Churchill can say to the English working class that he has kept the Empire intact and

('86', 222, 1, 2, 299640) preserved for them the foreign markets.
('86', 222, 1, 3, 299680) The people will, as they do, follow him.
('86', 222, 2, 4, 299721) R. C. So, you don’t think that the average man in Europe or America cares much for the high ideals for which the war is professed to be fought?
('86', 222, 3, 5, 299865) G. I am afraid, I do not.
('86', 222, 3, 6, 299891) If you hold the contrary view, I shall honour you for your belief but I cannot share it.
('86', 222, 4, 7, 299980) R. C. Then, you don’t think the Big Five or the Big Three can guarantee peace?
('86', 222, 5, 8, 300059) G. I am positive.
('86', 222, 5, 9, 300077) If they are so arrogant as to think that they can have lasting peace while the exploitation of the coloured and the so called backward races goes on, they are living in a fool’s paradise.
('86', 222, 6, 10, 300265) R. C. You think they will fall out among themselves before long?
('86', 222, 7, 11, 300330) G. There you are stealing my language.
('86', 222, 7, 12, 300369) The quarrel with Russia has already started.
('86', 222, 7, 13, 300414) It is only a question when the other two—England and America—will start quarreling with each other.
('86', 222, 7, 14, 300514) Maybe, pure self interest will dictate a wiser course and those who will be meeting at San Francisco will say: ‘Let us not fall out over a fallen carcass.’ The man in the street will gain nothing by it.
('86', 222, 7, 15, 300717) Freedom of India along non violent lines, on the other hand, will mean the biggest thing for the exploited races of the earth.
('86', 222, 7, 16, 300844) I am, therefore, trying to concentrate on it.
('86', 222, 7, 17, 300890) If India acts on the square when her turn comes, it will not dictate terms at the Peace Conference but peace and freedom will descend upon it, not as a terrifying torrent, but as ‘gentle rain from heaven’.
('86', 222, 7, 18, 301096) Liberty won non violently will belong to the least.
('86', 222, 7, 19, 301148) That is why I swear by non violence.
('86', 222, 7, 20, 301185) Only when the least can say, ‘I have got my liberty’ have I got mine.
('86', 222, 8, 21, 301255) The conversation then turned on the issue of the treatment of the aggressor nations after the war.
('86', 222, 9, 22, 301354) G. As a non violent man, I do not believe in the punishment of individuals, much less can I stomach the punishment of a whole nation.
('86', 222, 10, 23, 301488) R. C. What about the war criminals?
('86', 222, 11, 24, 301524) G. What is a war criminal?
('86', 222, 11, 25, 301551) Was not war itself a crime against God and humanity and, therefore, were not all those who sanctioned, engineered, and conducted wars, war criminals?
('86', 222, 11, 26, 301701) War criminals are notconfined to the Axis Powers alone.
('86', 222, 11, 27, 301757) Roosevelt and Churchill are no less war criminals than Hitler and Mussolini.
('86', 222, 11, 28, 301834) Hitler was “Great Britain’s sin”.
('86', 222, 11, 29, 301868) Hitler is only an answer to British imperialism, and this I say in spite of the fact that I hate
('86', 223, 0, 1, 301965) 224 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('86', 223, 1, 2, 302007) Hitlerism and its anti Semitism.
('86', 223, 1, 3, 302040) England, America and Russia have all of them got their hands dyed more or less red—not merely Germany and Japan.
('86', 223, 1, 4, 302153) The Japanese have only proved themselves to be apt pupils of the West.
('86', 223, 1, 5, 302224) They have learnt at the feet of the West and beaten it at its own game.
('86', 223, 2, 6, 302296) R. C. What would you see accomplished at San Francisco?
('86', 223, 3, 7, 302352) G. Parity among all nations—the strongest and the weakest —the strong should be the servants of the weak not their masters or exploiters.
('86', 223, 4, 8, 302490) R. C. Is not this too idealistic?
('86', 223, 4, 9, 302524) But you asked me what I would like to see accomplished.
('86', 223, 4, 10, 302580) It is my belief that human nature is ever working upward.
('86', 223, 4, 11, 302638) I can, therefore, never take a pessimistic view of the future of human nature.
('86', 223, 4, 12, 302717) If the Big Five say, ‘We shall hold on to what we have’, the result will be a terrible catastrophe and then Heaven help the world and the Big Five.
('86', 223, 4, 13, 302865) There will be another and bloodier war and another San Francisco.
('86', 223, 5, 14, 302931) R. C. Would the results of the second San Francisco be any better than that of the first?
('86', 223, 6, 15, 303021) G. I hope so.
('86', 223, 6, 16, 303035) They will be saner then.
('86', 223, 6, 17, 303060) They will have gained their balance somewhat after their third experience.
('86', 223, 7, 18, 303135) R. C. Would you not go to the West to teach them the art of peace?
('86', 223, 8, 19, 303202) G. In the second World War some British pacifists, including Dick Sheppard and Maude Royden had written to me asking me to point the way.
('86', 223, 8, 20, 303340) My reply in substance was: Even if one of you can become true in the right sense of the word, that one man will be able to inculcate non violence among the European folk.
('86', 223, 8, 21, 303511) I cannot today save Europe, however much I may like to.
('86', 223, 8, 22, 303567) I know Europe and America.
('86', 223, 8, 23, 303594) If I go there I shall be like a stranger.
('86', 223, 8, 24, 303636) Probably I shall be lionized but that is all.
('86', 223, 8, 25, 303682) I shall not be able to present to them the science of peace in language they can understand.
('86', 223, 8, 26, 303775) But they will understand if I can make good my non violence in India.
('86', 223, 8, 27, 303845) I shall then speak through India.
('86', 223, 8, 28, 303879) I, therefore, declined to accept the invitations from America and Europe.
('86', 223, 8, 29, 303953) My answer would be the same today.
('86', 223, 9, 30, 303988) R. C. If you were at San Francisco, what would you be advocat ing there?
('86', 223, 10, 31, 304061) G. If I knew I would tell you but I am made differently.
('86', 223, 10, 32, 304118) When I face a situation, the solution comes to me.
('86', 223, 10, 33, 304169) I am not a man who sits down and thinks out problems syllogistically.
('86', 223, 10, 34, 304239) I am a man of action.

('86', 224, 1, 3, 304336) Logic comes afterwards, it does not precede the event.
('86', 224, 1, 4, 304391) The moment I am at the Peace Conference, I know the right word will come.
('86', 224, 1, 5, 304465) But not beforehand.
('86', 224, 1, 6, 304485) This much, however, I can say that whatever I say there will be in terms of peace, not war.
('86', 224, 2, 7, 304577) R. C. What kind of world organization would promote an enduring peace or preserve it?
('86', 224, 3, 8, 304663) G. Only an organization based predominantly on truth and non violence.
('86', 224, 4, 9, 304734) R. C. With the present imperfect condition of the world and human nature, what means would in your opinion promote peace?
('86', 224, 5, 10, 304856) G. Nearest approach to the condition laid down in my answer to the previous question.
('86', 224, 6, 11, 304942) R. C. Would you have a world government?
('86', 224, 7, 12, 304983) G. Yes.
('86', 224, 7, 13, 304991) I claim to be a practical idealist.
('86', 224, 7, 14, 305027) I believe in compromise so long as it does not involve the sacrifice of principles.
('86', 224, 7, 15, 305111) I may not get a world government that I want just now but if it is a government that would just touch my ideal, I would accept it as a compromise.
('86', 224, 7, 16, 305258) Therefore, although I am not enamoured of a world federation, I shall be prepared to accept it if it is built on an essentially non violent basis.
('86', 224, 8, 17, 305405) R. C. If the nations of the world were to consider world government as a means for preserving peace and promoting the welfare of all peoples, would you advocate the abandonment of India’s aspiration for independence ill order to join in the general plan?
('86', 224, 9, 18, 305660) G. If you will carefully go through the much abused Congress resolution of August 1942, you will discover that independence is necessary for India becoming an efficient partner in any scheme for the preservation of lasting peace in the world.

('86', 225, 2, 3, 306025) January 1, 1945 Thus, though we find the young and the old, the rich and the poor, all passing away before our very eyes, we do not want to sit in peace; rather for the sake of living a few days more, we try everything except Rama.
('86', 225, 2, 4, 306257) January 2, 1945 How nice it would be if having realized this truth, we relied on Rama, put up with whatever ailments came our way and made our lives peaceful.
('86', 225, 2, 5, 306416) January 3, 1945 We saw the corporeal Mahadev 2 in his physical body and in his writings—which was one and the same thing.
('86', 225, 2, 6, 306538) The Mahadev, who transcends the body is, however, all pervading.
('86', 225, 2, 7, 306603) He can be recognized by his virtues which we can all share alike.
('86', 225, 2, 8, 306669) No one can have a greater or smaller share.
('86', 225, 2, 9, 306713) January 4, 1945 Are not birth and death perhaps the two sides of the same coin?
('86', 225, 2, 10, 306793) You find death on the one side and birth on the other.
('86', 225, 2, 11, 306848) Why should this give rise to sorrow or joy?
('86', 225, 2, 12, 306892) January 5, 1945 If this be true of birth and death as it certainly is, then why should we fear death even in the slightest degree or sorrow over it and rejoice in a birth?
('86', 225, 2, 13, 307064) Every man should ask himself this question.
('86', 225, 2, 14, 307108) January 6, 1945 The world is full of opposites.
('86', 225, 2, 15, 307156) There is sorrow behind happiness, and happiness behind sorrow.
('86', 225, 2, 16, 307219) Where there is sunshine,there is also shadow; where there is light, there is also darkness; where there is birth, there is also death.
('86', 225, 2, 17, 307354) Non attachment lies in remaining unaffected
('86', 225, 3, 18, 307398) 1 Gandhiji started writing “A Thought for the Day” for Anand T. Hingorani at the latter’s request on November 20, 1944, and continued the practice for about two years.
('86', 225, 3, 19, 307566) The thoughts for the period covered by this volume are reproduced as a single item under the last date, April 24, 1945. The thoughts were originally written in Hindi.
('86', 225, 3, 20, 307733) The translation by Anand T. Hingorani is reproduced here with slight alteration.

('86', 226, 1, 2, 307871) by these opposites.
('86', 226, 1, 3, 307891) The way to triumph over them is not to efface then, but to rise above them and be completely free from attachment.
('86', 226, 1, 4, 308006) January 7, 1945 The foregoing shows that the key to happiness lies in the worship of Truth, which is the giver of all things.
('86', 226, 1, 5, 308132) January 8, 1945 How, then, shall we worship truth?
('86', 226, 1, 6, 308183) Who knows the truth?
('86', 226, 1, 7, 308204) The reference here is to relative truth, that which appears to us as truth.
('86', 226, 1, 8, 308280) Experience will show that truth, even in this limited sense, is very hard indeed to observe.
('86', 226, 1, 9, 308373) January 9, 1945 Why does a person, knowing what is truth, hesitate to utter it?
('86', 226, 1, 10, 308453) Is he ashamed?
('86', 226, 1, 11, 308468) Ashamed of whom?
('86', 226, 1, 12, 308485) Whether high or low, what matters it?
('86', 226, 1, 13, 308523) The fact is that habit consumes us all.
('86', 226, 1, 14, 308563) Let us reflect over this and rid ourselves of the bad habit.
('86', 226, 1, 15, 308624) January 10, 1945 Unless we are freed from this habit, we cannot tread the path of truth.
('86', 226, 1, 16, 308713) Indeed, we must sacrifice all at the altar of truth.
('86', 226, 1, 17, 308766) We wish to appear not as we are but as very much better.
('86', 226, 1, 18, 308823) How nice it would be for us, if we are lowly, to appear lowly—but if we wish to rise, to act nobly and think nobly.
('86', 226, 1, 19, 308939) If that be not possible, then let us appear lowly.
('86', 226, 1, 20, 308990) Then some day we shall attain the desired height.
('86', 226, 1, 21, 309040) January 11, 1945 The more experience I gather, the more I realize that man himself is the cause of his happiness as well as his misery.
('86', 226, 1, 22, 309176) January 12, 1945 That being so, why is man happy or miserable?
('86', 226, 1, 23, 309239) January 13, 1945 The fact is that man does not like to give any thought to such things; so he persuades himself to believe that he has no time to spare for such reflection.
('86', 226, 1, 24, 309412) January 14, 1945 If we wish to live a true life, we must give up our mental laziness and do some basic thinking.
('86', 226, 1, 25, 309525) Our life will thereby become very simple.
('86', 226, 1, 26, 309567) January 15, 1945 A seer has called us wayfarers.
('86', 226, 1, 27, 309616) And it is true.
('86', 226, 1, 28, 309632) We are here for only a few days.
('86', 226, 1, 29, 309665) Thereafter we do not die, but only go home.

('86', 227, 1, 2, 309751) beautiful and true thought!
('86', 227, 1, 3, 309779) January 16, 1945 Hundreds of tons of earth and stone have to be excavated by means of hard labour before even one diamond is discovered.
('86', 227, 1, 4, 309916) Do we give even a fraction of this labour to the removal of the rubble of untruth and the search for the diamond of Truth?
('86', 227, 1, 5, 310039) January 17, 1945 Nothing is ever achieved without toil, that is without tapa 1. How, then, can self purification be possible without it?
('86', 227, 1, 6, 310176) January 18, 1945 If all our time belongs to God, how can we afford to waste even a single moment?
('86', 227, 1, 7, 310274) Likewise, if we belong to God, why should we devote even a part of our being to the pursuit of the vain pleasures of life?
('86', 227, 1, 8, 310397) January 19, 1945 Selfless action is a source of strength, for such action means the worship of God.
('86', 227, 1, 9, 310497) January 20, 1945 Jamshed Mehta has sent me one of the prayers of St. Francis of Assissi, a part of which reads: “O Divine Master!
('86', 227, 1, 10, 310627) It is in giving that we receive, and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.” January 21, 1945 Verily, the land belongs to him who labours on it.
('86', 227, 1, 11, 310782) January 22, 1945 He who is truly clean within, cannot remain unclean without.
('86', 227, 1, 12, 310860) January 23, 1945 A right cause never fails; A true word never hurts in the end.
('86', 227, 1, 13, 310940) January 24, 1945 A word uttered from a pure heart goes never vain.
('86', 227, 1, 14, 311007) January 25, 1945 If idleness gives us pain, we will not remain idle.
('86', 227, 1, 15, 311076) Similarly, if impurity causes us unhappiness, we will not be or stay impure.
('86', 227, 1, 16, 311153) Independence Day, January 26, 1945 Work must come first, and then, if possible, wages

('86', 228, 1, 2, 311290) commensurate with the amount of work done.
('86', 228, 1, 3, 311333) To work in this spirit is to serve God.
('86', 228, 1, 4, 311373) But if the wages are demanded first, that would be service to Satan.
('86', 228, 1, 5, 311442) January 27, 1945 It is well not to yield to desire.
('86', 228, 1, 6, 311494) Once we give in restraint becomes difficult if not impossible.
('86', 228, 1, 7, 311557) January 28, 1945 He who is unable to rule over himself can never really succeed in ruling over others.
('86', 228, 1, 8, 311660) January 29, 1945 In order to know himself, man must come out of his shell and view himself dispassionately.
('86', 228, 1, 9, 311768) January 30, 1945 No man is worthless who lightens anyone’s burden even the least bit.
('86', 228, 1, 10, 311854) January 31, 1945 Our happiness and peace of mind lie in our doing what we regard as right and proper, not in doing what others say or do.
('86', 228, 1, 11, 311992) February 1, 1945 Moral strength does accrue from the reading of scriptures; but real freedom cannot be attained without enlightenment.
('86', 228, 1, 12, 312127) February 2, 1945 To seek a favour is to barter away one’s freedom.
('86', 228, 1, 13, 312194) February 3, 1945 The greatness of a person lies in his heart, not in his head, that is, intellect.
('86', 228, 1, 14, 312293) February 4, 1945 Religion is that which comprehends all.
('86', 228, 1, 15, 312350) In other words, religion permeates life in all its aspects and at all times.
('86', 228, 1, 16, 312427) February 5, 1945 Religion is not something apart from life.
('86', 228, 1, 17, 312487) Life itself should be regarded as religion.
('86', 228, 1, 18, 312531) Life divorced from religion is not human life, it is animal life.
('86', 228, 1, 19, 312597) February 6, 1945 Those who have the greatest measure of self control or are most absorbed in work, speak the least.
('86', 228, 1, 20, 312713) Speech and action go ill together.

('86', 229, 1, 2, 312790) Look at Nature.
('86', 229, 1, 3, 312806) She is continuously in action, never resting for a single moment, and is yet silent.
('86', 229, 1, 4, 312891) February 7, 1945 He who thinks of the suffering humanity, will not think of himself.
('86', 229, 1, 5, 312976) Where has he the time?
('86', 229, 1, 6, 312999) February 8, 1945 A man will see and hear only that which he wishes to see and hear.
('86', 229, 1, 7, 313083) A gardener will see only the flowers in a garden, whilst a philosopher will be oblivious of them.
('86', 229, 1, 8, 313181) Perhaps he will not even notice whether he is inside the garden or outside!
('86', 229, 1, 9, 313257) February 9, 1945 We can see and even rectify our shortcomings through those we live with.
('86', 229, 1, 10, 313347) If we maintain the highest standard of purity in our everyday life, we can hope to render real service.
('86', 229, 1, 11, 313451) February 10, 1945 Those who take the vow of Truth should practise silence.
('86', 229, 1, 12, 313526) Nevertheless, we find that many a seeker after Truth is given to much talking, the obvious reason being force of habit.
('86', 229, 1, 13, 313646) Let us give up this habit.
('86', 229, 1, 14, 313673) February 11, 1945 How shall we remember the dear departed?
('86', 229, 1, 15, 313732) It is my firm belief that they do not die; it is only their bodies that perish.
('86', 229, 1, 16, 313812) Their memory has to be kept alive by imbibing their virtues as far as we can, by taking up their good work and promoting it to the best of our ability.
('86', 229, 1, 17, 313964) Flowers are placed on their samadhis to strengthen such remembrance.
('86', 229, 1, 18, 314033) But to remain content with mere flower offering would be idol worship.
('86', 229, 1, 19, 314104) February 12, 1945 How wrong it is to ask others to be clean when we ourselves remain unclean!
('86', 229, 1, 20, 314198) February 13, 1945 The only difference between man and man all the world over is one of degree, and not of kind, even as there is between trees of the same species.
('86', 229, 1, 21, 314362) Why then anger, envy or discrimination?
('86', 229, 1, 22, 314402) February 14, 1945 Let a man not make a good resolution at all; but if he makes one after due deliberation, let him never abandon it.

('86', 230, 1, 2, 314576) February 15, 1945 Man’s capacity for self deception is immeasurably greater than that for deceiving others.
('86', 230, 1, 3, 314684) Every sensible person will testify to this.
('86', 230, 1, 4, 314728) February 16, 1945 Credit lies in restraining one’s anger against one’s own kith and kin.
('86', 230, 1, 5, 314817) In the case of strangers, one is compelled to keep one’s temper under control.
('86', 230, 1, 6, 314896) What merit can there be in that?
('86', 230, 1, 7, 314929) February 17, 1945 Life means not revelry—eating, drinking and making merry but praising God, i.
('86', 230, 1, 8, 315025) e., rendering true service to humanity.
('86', 230, 1, 9, 315065) February 18, 1945 What distinguishes man from animals?
('86', 230, 1, 10, 315120) Comprehensive thinking on this question will solve a lot of our problems.
('86', 230, 1, 11, 315194) February 19, 1945 When man oversteps his limits, works or even thinks beyond his capacity, he is likely to be assailed by illness and anger.
('86', 230, 1, 12, 315335) Such haste is waste and can be harmful too.
('86', 230, 1, 13, 315379) February 20, 1945 In this morning’s bhajan it was said: “God never forgets us; it is we who forget Him.
('86', 230, 1, 14, 315483) And that is our misery.” February 21, 1945 When God does not wish it, neither wealth nor parents, nor the best of physicians, will save us.
('86', 230, 1, 15, 315623) What, then, should we do?
('86', 230, 1, 16, 315649) February 22, 1945 Have we any right to pray so long as we have not purged ourselves of our impurities?
('86', 230, 1, 17, 315752) February 23, 1945 A man may use a rosary because it is blessed by a saint or made of sacred tulsi 1, sandalwood or rudraksha beads.
('86', 230, 1, 18, 315884) But if the user looks upon the rosary as all, he had better throw it away.
('86', 230, 1, 19, 315959) If, however, the rosary draws him nearer to God and makes him alive to the performance of his duties, he may certainly use it regularly.
('86', 230, 1, 20, 316096) February 24, 1945 We exist, because God is.
('86', 230, 1, 21, 316140) This shows that man, or any living being, is part of the Divine.

('86', 231, 1, 2, 316255) February 25, 1945 There is a sentence in the New Testment: Let there be no care in they heart, nor fear of aught.
('86', 231, 1, 3, 316369) 1 This is for those who have faith in God.
('86', 231, 1, 4, 316412) February 26, 1945 The same New Testment tells us that if God leads us into temptation, He also delivers us from evil.
('86', 231, 1, 5, 316530) 2 This is applicable only to those who do not, of their own accord, succumb to temptation.
('86', 231, 1, 6, 316621) February 27, 1945 It is not as if Tulsidas was the only one who had sung the glory of the Lord’s name.
('86', 231, 1, 7, 316724) I find the same in the Bible as well.
('86', 231, 1, 8, 316762) In Romans, X. 13, it is said: “For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” February 28, 1945 Sin stays not hid.
('86', 231, 1, 9, 316898) It is writ large on the face of man.
('86', 231, 1, 10, 316935) We do not fully know that book but the thing is plain.
('86', 231, 1, 11, 316990) March 1, 1945 These days I have been reading verses from the Bible.
('86', 231, 1, 12, 317058) Today I find the following: “And all things, whatever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.” 3
('86', 231, 2, 13, 317168) March 2, 1945 “God is the Help of the helpless.” The same idea is also expressed in Psalms, XXXIV.
('86', 231, 2, 14, 317267) 18, which says: “The Lord is nigh untothem that are of a broken heart; and seventh such as be of a contrite spirit.” March 3, 1945 Isaiah, XLI.
('86', 231, 2, 15, 317411) 10 has: “Fear thou not; for I am with thee.” March 4, 1945 “Trust ye in the Lord for ever: for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.” Isaiah, XXVI.
('86', 231, 2, 16, 317566) 4. March 5, 1945 Just as it is in the nature of water to flow downward, so also does vice drags man downward and is, therefore, undoubtedly the easy way.
('86', 231, 2, 17, 317720) Virtue takes a man upward and so appears to be rather difficult.

('86', 232, 1, 4, 318101) 1. March 8, 1945 God’s word is: “I am, was and ever shall be, I am everywhere and in everything.” Knowing this, we turn away from God, seek refuge in that which is perishable and imperfect, and thus make ourselves miserable.
('86', 232, 1, 5, 318326) Can there be anything more amazing?
('86', 232, 1, 6, 318362) March 9, 1945 We must not draw distinctions between the East and the West.
('86', 232, 1, 7, 318437) Everything must be judged on its merits.
('86', 232, 1, 8, 318478) Thus alone can we do proper justice to things.
('86', 232, 1, 9, 318525) March 10, 1945 Why is there good and evil, happiness and misery?
('86', 232, 1, 10, 318590) God is and yet He is not an individual.
('86', 232, 1, 11, 318630) He is the Law as well as the Law giver.
('86', 232, 1, 12, 318670) Therefore it follows that man is what his actions make of him.
('86', 232, 1, 13, 318733) He rises by good actions, and falls by evil ones.
('86', 232, 1, 14, 318783) March 11, 1945 True service of society is that whereby society, that is, all its members, are uplifted.
('86', 232, 1, 15, 318887) Only by studying a particular society will it be possible to say how it can be raised.
('86', 232, 1, 16, 318974) March 12, 1945 Man knows very well that when death is near, there is no solace but God, yet hesitates to utter His name!
('86', 232, 1, 17, 319095) March 13, 1945 There is only one way of achieving independence through non violence: by dying we live, by killing never.
('86', 232, 1, 18, 319216) March 14, 1945 How shall we die?
('86', 232, 1, 19, 319249) By committing suicide?
('86', 232, 1, 20, 319272) To hold ourselves in readiness to die, when there is occasion for it, is to die only to live for ever.
('86', 232, 1, 21, 319375) March 15, 1945 There is nothing that cannot be attained by patience and equanimity.
('86', 232, 1, 22, 319459) The truth of this can be verified in one’s daily

('86', 233, 1, 3, 319562) March 16, 1945 Between destiny and human endeavour there is an inces sant struggle.
('86', 233, 1, 4, 319646) Let us continue to endeavour and leave the result to God.
('86', 233, 1, 5, 319704) March 17, 1945 Let us not leave everything to destiny, nor be vain about our endeavour.
('86', 233, 1, 6, 319792) Destiny will take its own course.
('86', 233, 1, 7, 319826) We should only see where we can intervene or where it is our duty to do so, whatever be the result.
('86', 233, 1, 8, 319926) March 18, 1945 The pity is that even while knowing what our duty is, we fail to perform it!
('86', 233, 1, 9, 320018) For this, let every man answer to himself.
('86', 233, 1, 10, 320061) March 19, 1945 Every moment of my life I realize that silence is the best speech.
('86', 233, 1, 11, 320143) If you must speak, speak as little as possible.
('86', 233, 1, 12, 320191) Avoid using two words if one suffices.
('86', 233, 1, 13, 320230) March 20, 1945 When little things upset us, let us understand that there is attachment lurking somewhere.
('86', 233, 1, 14, 320336) We should find it and banish it.
('86', 233, 1, 15, 320369) It is a delusion to think that we remain upright in big things, for there we are under compulsion.
('86', 233, 1, 16, 320468) Surely, that cannot pass for uprightness.
('86', 233, 1, 17, 320510) March 21, 1945 On such occasions the verse to remember is: “Contacts of the senses with their objects come and go.
('86', 233, 1, 18, 320625) Endure them.
('86', 233, 2, 19, 320638) March 22, 1945 Whatever one does, one must do well or not at all.
('86', 233, 2, 20, 320704) The truth of this one observes every day.
('86', 233, 2, 21, 320746) Today it was especially borne in upon me.
('86', 233, 2, 22, 320788) It was Ba’s death anniversary, and so there was the usual Gita recitation.
('86', 233, 2, 23, 320863) But there was no life in it.
('86', 233, 2, 24, 320892) March 23, 1945 A wrong ceases to be a wrong only when it is righted.
('86', 233, 2, 25, 320961) If suppressed, it erupts like a boil and assumes a dangerous form.
('86', 233, 2, 26, 321028) March 24, 1945 Man rises by realizing the true nature of the Self, by meditating
('86', 233, 3, 27, 321109) 1 Bhagavad Gita, II.
('86', 234, 0, 1, 321130) VOL. 86 : 4 MARCH, 1945 28 MAY, 1945 235
('86', 234, 1, 2, 321171) thereon and by following its virtues.
('86', 234, 1, 3, 321209) A contrary course of action leads to his downfall.
('86', 234, 1, 4, 321260) March 25, 1945 What is patience?
('86', 234, 1, 5, 321293) Shankaracharya says: “Sit by the seashore and take one drop of water on a blade of grass.
('86', 234, 1, 6, 321383) If you have enough patience, and there is a place near by wherein that drop can be stored, you may in time empty the ocean of all its water.” This is an illustration of almost perfect patience.
('86', 234, 1, 7, 321577) March 26, 1945 He who has not in him infinite patience cannot observe non violence.
('86', 234, 1, 8, 321661) March 27, 1945 What is the difference between a snake and a human being?
('86', 234, 1, 9, 321734) Apparently a snake crawls on its belly, while man walks erect on his feet.
('86', 234, 1, 10, 321809) Things are, however, not what they seem to be.
('86', 234, 1, 11, 321856) For what about the man who mentally crawls on his belly?
('86', 234, 1, 12, 321913) March 28, 1945 Every day I see the importance of silence.
('86', 234, 1, 13, 321971) It is good for all, but for him who is deeply absorbed in work, silence is indeed golden.
('86', 234, 1, 14, 322061) March 29, 1945 “The hasty are ruffled; the slow and steady have composure.” One sees the truth of this every moment.
('86', 234, 1, 15, 322178) March 30, 1945 How dangerous it is to fall out of routine?
('86', 234, 1, 16, 322237) Since coming to Bombay, I have failed to write daily.
('86', 234, 1, 17, 322291) (Written on 3 4 1945.) March 31, 1945 Nothing can work without rules.
('86', 234, 1, 18, 322361) The entire solar system would go to pieces if there were even a momentary breach of the rules governing it.
('86', 234, 1, 19, 322469) (Written on 3 4 1945.) April 1, 1945 This lesson is for all alike, big and small.
('86', 234, 1, 20, 322551) We must learn it and act accordingly, or else die a living death.
('86', 234, 1, 21, 322617) (Written on 3 4 1945.) April 2, 1945 It is sinful to multiply wants unnecessarily.

('86', 235, 1, 2, 322765) April 3, 1945 Hartal (general strike) is being observed today for saving the lives of those who have been condemned to the gallows.
('86', 235, 1, 3, 322897) If the day’s programme is carried out with understanding, we shall have taken a big stride forward on the path of non violence.
('86', 235, 1, 4, 323025) April 4, 1945 Man knows what his duty is, yet does not do what he knows he ought to.
('86', 235, 1, 5, 323110) Why is that so?
('86', 235, 1, 6, 323126) April 5, 1945 We shall be undone if we succumb to the psychological environment around us.
('86', 235, 1, 7, 323217) The situation regarding the Chimur prisoners keeps changing from day to day.
('86', 235, 1, 8, 323294) Let us do our duty and remain detached.
('86', 235, 1, 9, 323334) April 6, 1945 What a high degree of non violence is needed to bear patiently with a person who is bent on misunderstanding even the simplest thing!
('86', 235, 1, 10, 323482) April 7, 1945 I strive hard to preserve my physical body.
('86', 235, 1, 11, 323540) Do I take the same pains to know my soul?
('86', 235, 1, 12, 323582) April 8, 1945 When there is misunderstanding I become angry, I weep, I laugh, I feel pity.
('86', 235, 1, 13, 323673) But instead of this, is it not my duty to keep calm and try to remove the misunderstanding.
('86', 235, 1, 14, 323765) April 9, 1945 What shall we believe?
('86', 235, 1, 15, 323802) Praise of us or censure of us?
('86', 235, 1, 16, 323833) Both may be undeserved.
('86', 235, 1, 17, 323857) Then, shall we be our own judges?
('86', 235, 1, 18, 323891) Here too there is room enough for error.
('86', 235, 1, 19, 323932) God alone knows what we are, but He does not tell us.
('86', 235, 1, 20, 323986) It is, therefore, best neither to seek to know nor believe anything about ourselves.
('86', 235, 1, 21, 324071) We are what we are.
('86', 235, 1, 22, 324091) Nothing is to be gained by knowing or believing what we are.
('86', 235, 1, 23, 324152) Performance of duty is the only thing that really matters.
('86', 235, 1, 24, 324211) April 10, 1945 Blind is not he who has lost his eyes, but he who hides his shortcomings.
('86', 235, 1, 25, 324300) April 11, 1945 Man’s serenity of mind can be tested only in the world of men,
('86', 236, 0, 1, 324378) VOL. 86 : 4 MARCH, 1945 28 MAY, 1945 237
('86', 236, 1, 2, 324419) not on the solitary heights of the Himalayas.
('86', 236, 1, 3, 324465) April 12, 1945 An ideal is one thing; living up to it is quite another.
('86', 236, 1, 4, 324537) (Written on 15 4 1945.) April 13, 1945 A man without an ideal is like a ship without a rudder.
('86', 236, 1, 5, 324632) (Written on 15 4 1945.) April 14, 1945 I may be said to have an ideal only when I put forth an effort to realize it.
('86', 236, 1, 6, 324749) (Written on 15 4 1945.) April 15, 1945 We may rest content with trying, provided we make the right effort and to the best of our ability.
('86', 236, 1, 7, 324887) The result does not depend on the effort alone.
('86', 236, 1, 8, 324935) There are other factors over which we have no control.
('86', 236, 1, 9, 324990) April 16, 1945 What shall be called the right effort?
('86', 236, 1, 10, 325044) One test is that very often it yields the desired result.
('86', 236, 1, 11, 325102) So the rightness is judged by the result.
('86', 236, 1, 12, 325144) But experience shows that this is not always the case.
('86', 236, 1, 13, 325199) Right effort is that in which there is deep conviction about the correctness of the means employed, so much so that, even in the face of contrary results, the means do not change, nor does the effort vary or slacken.
('86', 236, 1, 14, 325416) April 17, 1945 What shall be called “the best of our ability”?
('86', 236, 1, 15, 325479) That effort in which we spend all our energy without stint.
('86', 236, 1, 16, 325539) Success generally attends such pure effort.
('86', 236, 1, 17, 325583) April 18, 1945 Man reaches decisions on the strength of insignificant evidence and shapes his course of action accordingly.
('86', 236, 1, 18, 325707) Where such is the case, it is better not to reach a decision as far as possible and to be indifferent as regards the results.
('86', 236, 1, 19, 325833) But should it become a duty to take a decision, it should be taken with the greatest possible care and should be fearlessly implemented.
('86', 236, 1, 20, 325970) April 19, 1945 An important matter loses importance if irrelevant.
('86', 236, 1, 21, 326037) A relevant thing, though small, is of the highest importance.

('86', 237, 1, 2, 326141) April 20, 1945 Man’s avarice reaches up to the highest heavens and down to the lowest regions of the earth.
('86', 237, 1, 3, 326249) Hence, it should be controlled.
('86', 237, 2, 4, 326281) MAHABALESHWAR, April 21, 1945 Man’s joy knows no bounds when he obtains something beyond his hopes.
('86', 237, 2, 5, 326381) April 22, 1945 There is surely something wrong with a person who is supposed to be highly spiritual and yet is always physically ailing.
('86', 237, 2, 6, 326518) April 23, 1945 If we think how enormous is the amount of work we have to do, we shall panic and accomplish nothing.
('86', 237, 2, 7, 326634) Whereas, if we coolly get to grips with it, we shall find that even a mountain of work becomes easier day by day and is ultimately completed.
('86', 237, 2, 8, 326776) April 24, 1945 We do not wish to see our own faults, but take delight in perceiving the faults of others.
('86', 237, 2, 9, 326882) Much unhappiness arises from this habit.

('86', 238, 9, 23, 328329) But one should know how to do that.
('86', 238, 9, 24, 328365) The servants should be treated as one’s brothers and sisters.

('86', 239, 8, 18, 329211) I entirely agree with you about liquor.

('86', 239, 8, 21, 329403) I intend to stay here up to the end of May and after that one month in Panchgani.
('86', 239, 8, 22, 329485) Whether or not I will be able to do so, rests with God.
('86', 239, 8, 23, 329541) I feel better.
('86', 239, 8, 24, 329556) I should be happy if Vasumati 1 stayed on there.

('86', 239, 8, 26, 329652) What Badshah Khan 2 says is partially true.
('86', 239, 8, 27, 329696) You went to Samau of your own accord, though it is true that I approved of your decision.
('86', 239, 8, 28, 329786) I would also approve of your going to the Frontier Province— probably, even more—but only on condition that you desired to go there.
('86', 239, 8, 29, 329919) Now I would not even induce you.

('86', 240, 1, 3, 330168) If you had not settled down to work there, you would have gone to the Frontier Province.
('86', 240, 1, 4, 330257) If you could train somebody for the Samau work, I should certainly like you to go to the Frontier Province.

('86', 240, 7, 12, 330629) BHA I APP A, It is good you have sent an account of the satyagraha.
('86', 240, 7, 13, 330697) Harijan brethren seem to have displayed considerable forbearance and courage.
('86', 240, 7, 14, 330775) I see the conditions were favourable.
('86', 240, 7, 15, 330813) That the people’s support too was forthcoming is a good sign.
('86', 240, 7, 16, 330875) Much remains to be done to make this success an enduring one.
('86', 240, 7, 17, 330937) In order to retain public support Harijan men and women will have to go a long way in purity and cleanliness.
('86', 240, 7, 18, 331047) It is not right to argue that others are not pure and clean.
('86', 240, 7, 19, 331108) Harijan brethren have to go against the current and should therefore develop the necessary strength.
('86', 240, 7, 20, 331209) Make use of this in whatever way you like, so that I need not write again.

('86', 241, 3, 5, 331576) You place reliance on me which, at the present moment, is not right.
('86', 241, 3, 6, 331645) One does not even know whether or not I shall recover.
('86', 241, 3, 7, 331700) I hope to live for 125 years but there are many obstacles in the way.
('86', 241, 3, 8, 331770) Even supposing I survived, it seems to me I shall only be an adviser.
('86', 241, 3, 9, 331840) It is true that if the Congress comes into power, I will suggest changes in the field of education.
('86', 241, 3, 10, 331940) However, your duty is clear.
('86', 241, 3, 11, 331969) Your work is to persuade your colleagues and go ahead.
('86', 241, 3, 12, 332024) That iswhy I sent Narahari’s 1 letter to you.
('86', 241, 3, 13, 332070) You will have to be cautious, if he holds a different view.
('86', 241, 3, 14, 332130) The essence of democracy is that one must move taking along one’s colleagues.
('86', 241, 3, 15, 332208) My help will be limited to using my infIuence.
('86', 241, 3, 16, 332255) I can render that help only if I am in Ahmedabad and listen to all the discussions.
('86', 241, 3, 17, 332339) Sitting here I can only write letters such as this.
('86', 241, 3, 18, 332391) Do you realize my limitations?

('86', 242, 3, 8, 333405) I am of the opinion that it will not be proper for you to go, if the central office has to bear the expenses.

('86', 243, 8, 14, 334914) Whatever we may have to say about anyone, we should let them know first.
('86', 243, 8, 15, 334987) Hence even if you yourself do not say anything to Mridulabehn 2, you should let me show your letter to her.

('86', 245, 4, 5, 337348) Why are you so stingy about your paper ?
('86', 245, 4, 6, 337389) I like economy but dislike stinginess.
('86', 245, 4, 7, 337428) You crowd in your words.
('86', 245, 4, 8, 337453) You must leave some space at the top and on the sides.
('86', 245, 4, 9, 337508) Dr. Sushila Nayyar says Hiralakshmi had no pleurisy.
('86', 245, 4, 10, 337561) Her disease is simply T.B. It is a great pity if the distilling machine has gone bad.

('86', 245, 4, 13, 337709) What will be the cost of a new one ?

('86', 247, 6, 10, 340177) MUN NALAL , I got your three letters together.
('86', 247, 6, 11, 340224) I have observed that when you write so many letters at once, you are agitated.
('86', 247, 6, 12, 340303) It is so this time, too.
('86', 247, 6, 13, 340328) Why is that?
('86', 247, 6, 14, 340341) You are agitated when I am in the Ashram and also when I am not.
('86', 247, 6, 15, 340406) Maybe, the nature of your agitation is different in the two cases, but the effect on your health is the same.
('86', 247, 6, 16, 340516) This shows that your unhappiness springs from within, and that its supposed externalcauses are nothing but imagination.
('86', 247, 6, 17, 340636) How can it be that your old co workers themselves harass you?
('86', 247, 6, 18, 340698) The harassment is imagined.
('86', 247, 6, 19, 340726) Differences of opinion do not constitute harassment.
('86', 247, 6, 20, 340779) What is the use of my ordering you?
('86', 247, 6, 21, 340815) After all it is with your co workers that you have to work and you must, therefore, work in harmony with them.
('86', 247, 6, 22, 340926) This is what is meant by public opinion, “democracy”.
('86', 247, 6, 23, 340980) Work of this nature can be done only by accepting the majority opinion or the decision of the person who has been selected as the leader.
('86', 247, 6, 24, 341118) Why should one feel unhappy about this, or think that one’s self respect is being offended?
('86', 247, 6, 25, 341210) This is the only way of serving other people—not in the manner we like, but in the manner that they desire.
('86', 247, 6, 26, 341318) Only if you do this cheerfully you will gain wisdom, rise higher and do the utmost possible service.
('86', 247, 6, 27, 341419) My advice, therefore, is that you should remain there and go on working patiently and cheerfully.
('86', 247, 6, 28, 341517) I should, of course, like you to deal with the so called servants as you would with your own brothers and sisters.
('86', 247, 6, 29, 341632) That will bring credit to you, and if you succeed, the results will be excellent.
('86', 247, 6, 30, 341714) Servants have always been with us in their capacity as

('86', 248, 1, 3, 341820) The only difference is that now we wish to draw them nearer to us and give some time to them.
('86', 248, 1, 4, 341914) If you do not show discretion in this, you will fail.
('86', 248, 1, 5, 341968) But even if you fail, what does it matter?
('86', 248, 1, 6, 342011) Success lies hidden in failure.
('86', 248, 1, 7, 342043) He who fails will one day succeed.
('86', 248, 1, 8, 342078) One who does nothing for fear of failing will achieve nothing.
('86', 248, 1, 9, 342141) If you start re counting from the point where you went wrong, you will get the figure right.
('86', 248, 1, 10, 342234) By losing yourself you will gain yourself.
('86', 248, 1, 11, 342277) One becomes oneself only if one ceases to be oneself.

('86', 248, 1, 13, 342383) Let it be lost.
('86', 248, 1, 14, 342399) I had a letter from Kanchan 1 today, which I am sending for your perusal.
('86', 248, 1, 15, 342473) Let her stay where she is.
('86', 248, 1, 16, 342500) She will get trained there.
('86', 248, 1, 17, 342528) Amtussalaam also mentions her in her letter.
('86', 248, 1, 18, 342573) I am, therefore, sending that too.
('86', 248, 1, 19, 342608) I tear up your letters.
('86', 248, 1, 20, 342632) You should never preserve your letters.
('86', 248, 1, 21, 342672) They contain your sarcasms on the impulse of the moment.
('86', 248, 1, 22, 342729) There is no point in re reading or recalling them.
('86', 248, 1, 23, 342780) All of you have been kept fully informed about ourselves.
('86', 248, 1, 24, 342838) We shall be here up to the end of May, then June in Panchgani and then Sevagram.
('86', 248, 1, 25, 342919) This is my intention.
('86', 248, 1, 26, 342941) Only His will be done.
('86', 248, 1, 27, 342964) Our hosts here are PremliIabehn 2 and Shantikumar 3, and in Panchgani it will beNanji Sheth 4. In addition, Bachchharajbhai 5 is of course at both the places.

('86', 249, 2, 3, 343417) MAHABALESHWAR, April 26, 1945
('86', 249, 3, 4, 343447) 1, I got your letter.
('86', 249, 3, 5, 343469) Chi....
('86', 249, 3, 6, 343477) likes what you have done.
('86', 249, 3, 7, 343503) You need not, therefore, think about it any more.
('86', 249, 3, 8, 343553) I examined your doings not as those of a near relation, but as an educated woman’s.
('86', 249, 3, 9, 343637) Though you were not guilty, even then I regard it as a great error on your part to have kept the knowledge of his marriage in childhood a secret.
('86', 249, 3, 10, 343783) I did like, of course, your marrying outside the caste.
('86', 249, 3, 11, 343839) That neither ...
('86', 249, 3, 12, 343856) nor you treated the childhood marriage as marriage seems altogether improper.
('86', 249, 3, 13, 343934) seems to be a very good man.
('86', 249, 3, 14, 343963) However, according to me he has done no service to the lady.
('86', 249, 3, 15, 344024) You certainly have not.
('86', 249, 3, 16, 344048) How would you have felt, if you had been in that woman’s place?
('86', 249, 3, 17, 344112) There are numerous cases in Hindu society like.
('86', 249, 3, 18, 344160) If everybody did what he had done, what would be the condition of the girls married to them?
('86', 249, 3, 19, 344253) .’s duty was to live with that girl and be her teacher.
('86', 249, 3, 20, 344309) You were tempted by the thought of doing social service, and he was infatuated with you.
('86', 249, 3, 21, 344398) You need not accept this analysis.
('86', 249, 3, 22, 344433) Both of you believe that you have followed dharma in what you did.
('86', 249, 3, 23, 344500) That is enough for you.
('86', 249, 3, 24, 344524) One’s dharma is what one believes to be so.
('86', 249, 3, 25, 344568) I am not writing separately to....

('86', 257, 9, 19, 352806) NAR ANDAS , I like the scheme 2. There are two tests in it—of yarn contribution and pice contribution.
('86', 257, 9, 20, 352909) In both what matters is the number of donors.
('86', 257, 9, 21, 352955) Yarn is a source of strength, as is evident from the very saying: “Many threads mean strength.” One thread of yarn may snap, but a rope made up of many threads would pull much heavier weight depending on the number of threads...
('86', 257, 9, 22, 353184) 3 Therefore yarn, from a single individual, however much it may be, is of no consequence.
('86', 257, 9, 23, 353274) There will be many who will be ready to give more than seventy six pice...
('86', 257, 9, 24, 353349) It is good that you have decided not to accept more.
('86', 257, 9, 25, 353402) Similarly [even less than that] 4 cannot be accepted.
('86', 257, 9, 26, 353456) Otherwise the account will not be clear.
('86', 257, 9, 27, 353497) Only a little ....
('86', 257, 9, 28, 353516) There are millions in this poor country who can offer no more than a pie.
('86', 257, 9, 29, 353590) There are also likely to be millions who

('86', 258, 1, 4, 354030) Similarly a family may contribute 76 pice for each member.

('86', 258, 5, 10, 354292) MAN I, I got your letter.
('86', 258, 5, 11, 354318) Immediately after reading it, I tore it up.
('86', 258, 5, 12, 354362) It had been kept aside by mistake, but it came to me as soon as it was discovered that it was personal.
('86', 258, 5, 13, 354466) But what is there so personal in what you have written?
('86', 258, 5, 14, 354522) I myself opened it just to respect your wishes and to reassure you and will post this in the same way.
('86', 258, 5, 15, 354625) As for fasts, perhaps I must have undertaken more of them than anyone else in the group.
('86', 258, 5, 16, 354714) In South Africa I used to fast on any pretext.
('86', 258, 5, 17, 354761) I must have taken only one meal a day for more than a year.
('86', 258, 5, 18, 354821) But I am of the opinion that moderation in eating is more difficult than fasting.
('86', 258, 5, 19, 354903) Fasts have a place in our life but the death of a relative is certainly not an occasion for them.
('86', 258, 5, 20, 355001) Why shouldn’t they be undertaken on the occasion of birth?
('86', 258, 5, 21, 355060) I have done that also but gave that up on further reflection.
('86', 258, 5, 22, 355122) From this you can judge your fasts.
('86', 258, 5, 23, 355158) 1 The human body is the temple of God, and should be taken care of as such.
('86', 258, 5, 24, 355234) It is not that I do not know of your regular habits.
('86', 258, 5, 25, 355287) Motilalji 2
('86', 258, 6, 26, 355299) gave you first rank in that.
('86', 258, 6, 27, 355328) But you should be charitable to co workers.
('86', 258, 6, 28, 355372) You fail in your duty to your neighbours because you are not so.
('86', 258, 6, 29, 355437) Moreover you admit your shortcomings.
('86', 258, 6, 30, 355475) People admit their short comings either because they wish to stick to them or wish to cure themselves of them.
('86', 258, 6, 31, 355586) Don’t you wish to get rid of your shortcomings?
('86', 258, 6, 32, 355634) You should infect others with your regularity and at the same time must preserve yours.

('86', 260, 5, 14, 357757) Those who have not taken up Hindustani, or do not know it, learn only half the rashtrabhasha.
('86', 260, 5, 15, 357851) That is why I am partial to Hindustani.

('86', 260, 5, 18, 358045) Hindi is a language which Hindus and Muslims speak and is written in the Nagari or Urdu script.
('86', 260, 5, 19, 358141) If that is so, you and I have to know both the scripts and be familiar with the vocabulary of both.
('86', 260, 5, 20, 358241) That being the case, you have to revive the Urdu script and always keep in touch with it.
('86', 260, 5, 21, 358331) Besides, in order to remove the feeling of hostility you should join the Hindustani Prachar Sabha.
('86', 260, 5, 22, 358430) If everyone does so, the hostility will be removed.

('86', 263, 4, 5, 361876) He said that he had felt that people in Lanka sought to be separated from India, although the culture and problems of both were similar.
('86', 263, 4, 6, 362013) He was glad, however, to learn that there were people in Lanka who realized this unity.
('86', 263, 4, 7, 362101) Such people, he added, needed no message from him.
('86', 263, 4, 8, 362152) They have only to understand the message of the charkha, khadi and the constructive programme, including village uplift and fostering of a national language.
('86', 263, 4, 9, 362310) He referred to his tour of Ceylon 15 years ago 2 and his embarrassment then to notice European and alien habits and customs of the people there, and wished that the Ceylonese had known more about India and the message of the charkha.

('86', 278, 7, 20, 381620) Meanwhile drink plenty of boiled water, take orange juice and juice of raw vegetable such as carrots, palak and snake gourd.
('86', 278, 7, 21, 381745) You can drink not more than three pounds of milk and take three ounces of fresh coconut well chewed.
('86', 278, 7, 22, 381846) Drink the water of the coconut.
('86', 278, 7, 23, 381878) If the piles bleed, take rest, omit one meal and apply oil to the affected part.

('86', 280, 1, 3, 383695) This is worth seriously thinking over.
('86', 280, 1, 4, 383734) Those who stay separately may continue to do so and go on doing their work, and I would pass the rest of my life touring.
('86', 280, 1, 5, 383856) This seems to me to be the best thing to do.
('86', 280, 1, 6, 383901) Do not discuss this with too many people.
('86', 280, 1, 7, 383943) First you yourself should think, and do what seems best to you.
('86', 280, 1, 8, 384007) You need not even show this letter to anybody.
('86', 280, 1, 9, 384054) You are the Chairman.

('86', 280, 5, 14, 384241) MUN NALAL , Chairman means Chimanlal.
('86', 280, 5, 15, 384279) Inability to come to a decision immediately is no shortcoming, if he is otherwise able to come to a correct decision and express his view in time.
('86', 280, 5, 16, 384426) Chimanlal is the Chairman because he is the most qualified of all.
('86', 280, 5, 17, 384493) But the inmates of the Ashram have a right to appoint another person as Chairman.
('86', 280, 5, 18, 384575) Decide first on who are Ashram inmates.
('86', 280, 5, 19, 384615) If you think it beyond your capacity, the question of majority vote, or for that matter even of one vote, does not arise.
('86', 280, 5, 20, 384737) If all the inmates regard themselves as incapable of running the kitchen, thejoint kitchen should be closed.
('86', 280, 5, 21, 384846) In that case everybody will have to run his own kitchen.
('86', 280, 5, 22, 384903) I do believe, of course, that the Ashram cannot be run in that way.
('86', 280, 5, 23, 384971) It would then be something different.
('86', 280, 5, 24, 385009) I had accepted the suggestion that you should be requested to leave.

('86', 283, 6, 10, 387353) Bhai Jivanji has brought out at the right moment a collection of my writings and speeches on the subject of our national language.
('86', 283, 6, 11, 387484) I have not found it possible to go through all the writings collected here but I have read the first twenty pages.
('86', 283, 6, 12, 387599) I made the first speech 3 on this subject in 1917. And I hold the same views today as those expressed in the speech or thereafter from time to time.
('86', 283, 6, 13, 387748) The only difference is that they are now stronger, clearer and more definite than before.
('86', 283, 6, 14, 387838) Hindi and Urdu have always been inseparable to me.
('86', 283, 6, 15, 387889) I have also quite freely used the word Hindustani.
('86', 283, 6, 16, 387940) I am saying the same thing today that I did in the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan session at Indore in 1918. Hindustani is not Urdu but a happy amalgam of Hindi and Urdu which people in Northern India may easily understand and which may be written either in the Nagari or Urdu script.
('86', 283, 6, 17, 388217) That alone is the perfect national language; all others are imperfect.
('86', 283, 6, 18, 388288) For the present those who desire to learn the national language fully and not partially must learn both the scripts and know both the forms.
('86', 283, 6, 19, 388429) It is a duty demanded of us by our love for the nation.

('86', 295, 2, 3, 402891) MAHABALESHWAR, May 3, 1945
('86', 295, 3, 4, 402918) MANI, I got your letter.
('86', 295, 3, 5, 402943) It is clear.
('86', 295, 3, 6, 402956) As regards your fasts, I suggest that you should undertake them only for reasons of health.
('86', 295, 3, 7, 403048) You will then come to know about yourself, profit from it spiritually too and be emancipated from superstition or insincerity.
('86', 295, 3, 8, 403175) It is quite absurd to think that we should at least fast in memory of Ba or Mahadev if we cannot do anything more.
('86', 295, 3, 9, 403290) They would surely be distressed at this if they could know about it.
('86', 295, 3, 10, 403359) When we lose a dear one, we should do something difficult and at the same time dear to them.
('86', 295, 3, 11, 403452) We might cultivate a sweetness of temper like Mahadev’s or faith like Ba’s.
('86', 295, 3, 12, 403528) I have cited these as two illustrations which readily come to my mind.
('86', 295, 3, 13, 403599) We can think of more.
('86', 295, 3, 14, 403621) If only we realize that the body is the temple of God, or rather the instrument of God realization, all will be well with us.
('86', 295, 3, 15, 403747) Then the fraud which now passes for religion will cease.
('86', 295, 3, 16, 403804) I take all this trouble to explain things to you because you are simple in habits and have resisted many temptations.
('86', 295, 3, 17, 403922) I know that you would be able to achieve much more if you could rise higher in all respects.
('86', 295, 3, 18, 404015) And that is why I wish to draw you here or to the Ashram.
('86', 295, 3, 19, 404073) Father too feels that way, and that makes me all the more eager to attract you.
('86', 295, 3, 20, 404153) If Father was out of prison neither you nor I would desire that even for a single moment you should be anywhere else but by his side.
('86', 295, 3, 21, 404287) If you are near me, you will grow in tolerance, for this is a place where one has to cultivate detachment in spite of having to adjust oneself to different temperaments.
('86', 295, 3, 22, 404457) This means that we should always be ready to learn from others.
('86', 295, 3, 23, 404521) We should observe people, emulate their virtues and bear with their weaknesses for that is the best way of curing them.
('86', 295, 3, 24, 404641) And, therefore, come soon.
('86', 295, 3, 25, 404668) You did well to give me news of Nandubehn, Diwan Master 1 and [Dr.] Kanuga.

('86', 298, 6, 14, 407567) But since you lack firmness, the two virtues become mere feelings.
('86', 298, 6, 15, 407634) You lack firmness because although you know the atman, you do not have paramatma standing before you.
('86', 298, 6, 16, 407736) And how can there be atman where paramatma is not?
('86', 298, 6, 17, 407787) And how can we exist if there is no atman?

('86', 301, 3, 4, 410647) Mr. D. N. Balavenkataram, former President of the Salem Taluka Congress Committee, asked Gandhiji whether the Press reports that he would not think of entering the temple of Mahabaleshwar as long as they were not open to the Harijans were correct.
('86', 301, 3, 5, 410895) Mahatma Gandhi remarked: Yes, the Press reports are true.
('86', 301, 3, 6, 410953) As long as the doors of the temples are not open to the Harijans, I shall never enter them.
('86', 301, 4, 7, 411045) Replying to a question whether a visitor should go on a fast unto death to see that the temples were open to the Harijans, Gandhiji said: No.
('86', 301, 4, 8, 411187) That would be an act of violence.
('86', 301, 5, 9, 411221) Asked when a fast was violent and when it could be construed as non violent, Gandhiji replied that it would depend on the circumstances of each case.

('86', 302, 2, 3, 411906) MAHABALESHWAR, May 4, 1945 These are the remarks attributed to Sir Firoz Khan Noon 1 as having been made by him at San Francisco.
('86', 302, 3, 4, 412036) Sir Firoz Khan Noon claimed that while the Japanese were overrunning Burma and heading towards India, the agents of Mahatma Gandhi’s party severely damaged or destroyed 332 railway stations and 945 post offices.
('86', 302, 3, 5, 412248) He also alleged that Gandhiji himself encouraged disobedience because “he was convinced that Britain had been defeated and he did not want to displease the Japanese.
('86', 302, 3, 6, 412414) Gandhiji is in the hands of the reactionary and orthodox Hindus.
('86', 302, 3, 7, 412479) He would be doing a great service to the country if, at this moment, he were to retire in favour of a younger man.
('86', 302, 3, 8, 412594) I feel Nehru would be an excellent successor to Gandhi.
('86', 302, 3, 9, 412650) He has quite a large support among the Muslims and is not so bigoted as Gandhi, who is at a dead end.
('86', 302, 3, 10, 412752) The only solution is for Nehru to come to the forefront.
('86', 302, 3, 11, 412809) But Nehru respects Gandhi so much that he would not come forward.” Assuming their authenticity, I beg to offer the following remarks: Time was when I was considered by the British rulers as pro Japanese, but they quietly withdrew the remark.
('86', 302, 3, 12, 413051) There was not the slightest foundation for it.
('86', 302, 3, 13, 413098) It comes somewhat as a surprise that Sir Firoz should make such a statement at this juncture.
('86', 302, 3, 14, 413192) It may interest him to know that even when the British had suffered severe reverses, I told the masses that the British were fighters who were never dismayed by defeats, delighted in bungling and never learned except by making and even repeating mistakes.
('86', 302, 3, 15, 413448) I commend my writings before the August of 1942 to Sir Firoz.
('86', 302, 3, 16, 413510) He will find in them my answer 2 to the Congress Responsibility for the Disturbances, 1942 43. I stood for unadulterated Indianindependence and, therefore, could not afford to be lukewarm about Japanese or any other Power’s success against the British.
('86', 302, 3, 17, 413763) My purpose was to end British or any other foreign rule in India as a whole through non violent non co operation and civil resistance.
('86', 302, 4, 18, 413898) 1 Defence Member in the Viceroy’s Executive Council from October 1943; he was one of the three members of the Indian delegation to the San Francisco Peace Conference; the other two were A. Ramaswami Mudaliar and V. T. Krishnamachari.
('86', 302, 4, 19, 414132) Noon was answering questions in an interview to Indian journalists attending the Conference.

('86', 303, 0, 1, 414314) 304 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('86', 303, 1, 2, 414356) I had never any party of mine in the Congress.
('86', 303, 1, 3, 414403) I ceased to be its member from December 1934. Whenever my services were needed by the Congress, it had every right to call me in for my special training in non violent resistance.
('86', 303, 1, 4, 414583) Neither the Congress nor I had anything to do with civil or other resistance in and after August 1942. I alone was armed with authority to start it when in my opinion the time for it came.
('86', 303, 1, 5, 414772) But I was arrested before I could take any action or even issue any instructions.
('86', 303, 1, 6, 414854) Therefore neither the Congress nor I could be saddled with any responsibility for the disturbances of 1942. Apart from that fact, the figures quoted by Sir Firoz are utterly unproved, the Government, though often challenged, never having taken the trouble to prove before a competent court of law the charges made by them with surprising lavishness.
('86', 303, 1, 7, 415204) Next, I come to Sir Firoz’s statement about Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and me.
('86', 303, 1, 8, 415280) He should know that I have called the Pandit my successor.
('86', 303, 1, 9, 415339) He does not need to come to the front.
('86', 303, 1, 10, 415378) He is in the front.
('86', 303, 1, 11, 415398) The Government of India would not let him work as he would.
('86', 303, 1, 12, 415458) He and I are friends.
('86', 303, 1, 13, 415480) But we are no rivals.
('86', 303, 1, 14, 415502) We are both servants of the people and the platform of service is as big as the world.
('86', 303, 1, 15, 415589) It is never overcrowded.
('86', 303, 1, 16, 415614) On it, there is always room for more, and as on the point of independence we have no differences, we are always brothers in arms.
('86', 303, 1, 17, 415744) He has undoubtedly the advantage of youth over me.
('86', 303, 1, 18, 415795) Let Sir Firoz ask his Government, on pain of resignation, to release Pandit Nehru and his fellow prisoners, and he will see his wish fulfilled.
('86', 303, 1, 19, 415939) I shall give him my hearty co operation in its fulfilment.
('86', 303, 1, 20, 415998) Let him make no capital out of my supposed bigotry or orthodoxy.
('86', 303, 1, 21, 416063) He may not know that I have never been a bigot or known as such since my youth.
('86', 303, 1, 22, 416143) And orthodoxy would not have me for my uncompromising and radical attitude on untouchability and general social reform.
('86', 303, 1, 23, 416263) Sir Firoz is on safer ground when he accuses me of being out of date.
('86', 303, 1, 24, 416333) For no one knows what or who is out of date.
('86', 303, 1, 25, 416378) I confess my ignorance on the point.
('86', 303, 2, 26, 416415) 1 In Mahatma, Vol. 7, p.
('86', 303, 2, 27, 416440) 5, D. G. Tendulkar says: “George Bernard shaw stepped in to defend Gandhi: ‘Gandhi’s politics is half a century out of date.
('86', 303, 2, 28, 416565) His tactics like all tactics are subject to error and readjustment, but his strategy is sound, as it was fifty or five millon years ago.’ As for Gandhi’s retiring, he added: ‘Retire from what?
('86', 303, 2, 29, 416758) His position is natural, not official.
('86', 303, 2, 30, 416797) The Mahatma cannot hand over anything.
('86', 303, 2, 31, 416836) Leadership is not a plug of tobacco that can be passed from one man to another.’ ”

('86', 304, 1, 2, 416960) I notice too a remark made that “the Cripps Mission would have had a greater chance of success, if Mr. Gandhi had not interfered at the last stage”.
('86', 304, 1, 3, 417109) It is astonishing how a lie, once it gets a start, persists.
('86', 304, 1, 4, 417170) I left Delhi long before the Mission had commenced its talks with the Working Committee.
('86', 304, 1, 5, 417259) I then ceased to interest myself in the Mission, having more important work on hand.

('86', 310, 3, 4, 424050) SATYANARAYANJI, If you understand individual self reliance, you should understand the self reliance of a society or an institution.
('86', 310, 3, 5, 424182) If an individual believes that he will get his bread if he puts in earnest labour, then the same is true of an institution.
('86', 310, 3, 6, 424306) That is to say, if it renders service, it will get bread without asking, meaning thereby that it will get the money to meet its expenses.
('86', 310, 3, 7, 424444) In fact, it should get the money from its neighbours.
('86', 310, 3, 8, 424498) If it does not get it, then it should realize that no one cares for its services.
('86', 310, 3, 9, 424580) Such a thing can happen while dispelling ignorance in a land of blind faith.
('86', 310, 3, 10, 424657) Then the expenses will be borne by the reformers.
('86', 310, 3, 11, 424707) The same rule will apply here too.
('86', 310, 3, 12, 424742) The reformers in the beginning will starve, a few of them will even die.
('86', 310, 3, 13, 424815) We must have faith that God will sustain them in some way or other.
('86', 310, 3, 14, 424883) If you don’t fully understand this, we shall discuss it.

('86', 311, 3, 5, 425836) Your handwriting is worse than mine.
('86', 311, 3, 6, 425873) I can hardly read it.

('86', 313, 3, 5, 427925) Don’t say cleaning duty—say cleaning work or dharma to clean up.
('86', 313, 3, 6, 427990) Duty means dharma.
('86', 313, 3, 7, 428009) It is not ‘bheen’ but ‘bhinna’.

('86', 315, 8, 13, 430709) NARAHARI, I have gone through your book Kanyane Patro.
('86', 315, 8, 14, 430764) The letters seem to have been written with great care but you have not been bold enough.
('86', 315, 8, 15, 430853) Your views about mixed marriages are not expressed clearly.
('86', 315, 8, 16, 430913) Since I believe that we cannot have too many of such marriages, I do not at all approve of marriages within the same caste.
('86', 315, 8, 17, 431037) I do not find you advocating mixed marriages on an extensive scale even within the same province.
('86', 315, 8, 18, 431135) You accept inter provincial marriages only as exceptions.
('86', 315, 8, 19, 431193) I would encourage them and they ought to be encouraged.
('86', 315, 8, 20, 431249) Reformists, being indifferent to religion, may do that, but their example will have no effect.
('86', 315, 8, 21, 431344) We, however, who keep religion in the forefront should make up our minds how far we are prepared to go.
('86', 315, 8, 22, 431448) If Hindustani becomes the national language and castes and sub castes as we know them disappear—as they should—we should unhesitatingly accord the highest importance to marriages between Ati Sudras and caste Hindus.
('86', 315, 8, 23, 431664) The question of provincial boundaries will not even arise then.
('86', 315, 8, 24, 431728) Where parents are wise, there should be no difficulty even about marriages between persons of different religions.
('86', 316, 0, 1, 431843) VOL. 86 : 4 MARCH, 1945 28 MAY, 1945 317
('86', 316, 1, 2, 431884) Do we not look upon all religions as equal?
('86', 316, 1, 3, 431928) It is with some purpose that we have accorded a place to other faiths in our prayer.
('86', 316, 1, 4, 432013) The offspring may choose either religion.
('86', 316, 1, 5, 432055) The couple of our conception will give the children liberal education in that regard.
('86', 316, 1, 6, 432141) In my view this should be quite easy.
('86', 316, 1, 7, 432179) In ‘letters addressed to a girl’, such things should be stated firmly and clearly.
('86', 316, 1, 8, 432262) Mahadev’s article is a little out of focus.
('86', 316, 1, 9, 432306) Vanamala’s doubt is correct.
('86', 316, 1, 10, 432335) What do our Jain nuns do?
('86', 316, 1, 11, 432361) And what about Swaminarayan nuns?
('86', 316, 1, 12, 432395) It will produce indigestion in the children if we give them so much from English literature.
('86', 316, 1, 13, 432488) Comparisons should be made only between equals.
('86', 316, 1, 14, 432536) Our culture is free from the extremes of Western culture.
('86', 316, 1, 15, 432594) We may know that culture after we have grown up and compare it with ours.
('86', 316, 1, 16, 432668) Growing children should first understand and assimilate their own heritage.
('86', 316, 1, 17, 432744) But I will not make this too long.
('86', 316, 1, 18, 432779) I was forgetting one point.
('86', 316, 1, 19, 432807) You have written with people of our category in view, i.
('86', 316, 1, 20, 432864) e., the upper three castes, and even among them Brahmins and Banias.
('86', 316, 1, 21, 432933) What about Rajputs?
('86', 316, 1, 22, 432953) And Sudras?
('86', 316, 1, 23, 432965) Also Ati Sudras?
('86', 316, 1, 24, 432982) They permit divorce and remarriage.
('86', 316, 1, 25, 433018) There are also communities among whom there is no such thing as marriage ceremony.
('86', 316, 1, 26, 433101) Even then purity is observed.
('86', 316, 1, 27, 433131) This thing must be mentioned.

('86', 318, 1, 2, 434735) 552. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
('86', 318, 2, 3, 434763) MAHABALESHWAR, May 6, 1945
('86', 318, 3, 4, 434790) What do you think of the future plans now being made by the Government to dispose of Indian industries under high sounding phrases, through the nationalist minded Sir Ardeshir Dalal 1 and through the visit of capitalists reported to be presently despatched unofficially to America and England, under the auspices of the Government of India?
('86', 318, 3, 5, 435131) This question has been put to me.
('86', 318, 3, 6, 435165) Nothing said by those outside the Government ring seems to matter.
('86', 318, 3, 7, 435232) They have come to know that the best of us will speak loud and give it the lie by our action.
('86', 318, 3, 8, 435326) Big merchants, capitalists, industrialists and others speak and write against the Government, but in action do its will and even profit—through it—though the profit may amount to, say, five per cent against the Government’s 95. Circumstances alone may be to blame for the condition in which the country has been weltering since the advent of British commerce backed by British guns.
('86', 318, 3, 9, 435709) The bright spot in the situation, however, is that all the big interests proclaim with one voice that India wants nothing less than her own elected national government to shape her own destiny free of all control, British or other.
('86', 318, 3, 10, 435941) This independence will not come for the asking.
('86', 318, 3, 11, 435989) It will come only when the interests, big or small, are prepared to forgo the crumbs that fall to them from partnership with the British in the loot which British rule takes from India.
('86', 318, 3, 12, 436175) Verbal protests will count for nothing so long as the partnership continues unchecked.
('86', 318, 3, 13, 436262) The so called unofficial deputation, which the protestants fear, will go to England and America, dare not proceed, whether for inspection or for entering into a shameful deal, so long as the moving spirits of the Working Committee are being detained without any trial for the sole crime of sincerely striving for India’s independence without shedding a drop of blood save their own.

('86', 322, 3, 4, 441124) VASUMATI, What I said, did not mean what you have understood it mean.
('86', 322, 3, 5, 441194) All I meant was that you should not lose balance of mind.
('86', 322, 3, 6, 441252) But now I should also like to mean what you have inferred.
('86', 322, 3, 7, 441311) Free yourself from outside involvements and dig yourself in at Samau whether you live or die.
('86', 322, 3, 8, 441405) The hope I have cherished of you will flower if you can do so.

('86', 322, 3, 13, 441704) Do whatever you do, only after measuring your own strength.

('86', 322, 7, 21, 442064) MUNNALAL, I have your two letters.
('86', 322, 7, 22, 442099) It is not good that you strain yourself and write at twelve o’clock.
('86', 322, 7, 23, 442168) You should go to bed by ten and get up at four.

('86', 323, 1, 11, 443211) But why need she think aboutthat at all?
('86', 323, 1, 12, 443252) She is a girl who wants to be useful and can be useful in many ways.

('86', 331, 14, 27, 454435) My blessings will haunt like a ghost anyone who contravenes the condition attaching to it.” According to Pyarelal, “Gandhiji explained, he had put all concerned, including the British Government, on their honour and made it easier for the industrialist friends to put up a fight against any reaction whether within their ranks or without and resist any plan detrimental to Indian interests.

('86', 333, 2, 5, 456385) The simple reason, perhaps, is that they never die with the dissolution of their bodies.

('86', 337, 3, 5, 461861) The replies to your questions are given below: 1. Communal representation is in itself bad.
('86', 337, 3, 6, 461953) 2. No one today has the right to enrol members for the Congress.
('86', 337, 3, 7, 462018) The committees you mention have not been formed constitutionally.
('86', 337, 3, 8, 462084) They just set themselves up.
('86', 337, 3, 9, 462113) Everyone can therefore refuse to recognize them.
('86', 337, 3, 10, 462162) 4. So far as I am aware there are no restrictions in this regard laid down in the Congress Constitution.
('86', 337, 3, 11, 462267) Even a hooligan can enter the Congress.
('86', 337, 3, 12, 462307) 5. Yes, provided, they sincerely work for the Congress.
('86', 337, 3, 13, 462363) The above answers should be considered tentative.
('86', 337, 3, 14, 462413) They represent my personal view.
('86', 337, 3, 15, 462446) From a legal angle my view could be wrong and, even if it was not, it could be rejected for the simple reason that I do not possess any authority.
('86', 337, 3, 16, 462593) You may therefore assume that it is not to be taken into account.

('86', 339, 6, 21, 465346) You have sent a telegram.

('86', 339, 6, 30, 465881) What is the point in going if you will not serve their interests?

('86', 341, 2, 3, 467428) MAHABALESHWAR, May 11, 1945
('86', 341, 3, 4, 467456) BHAI TARACHAND, Pandit Sunderlal is here.
('86', 341, 3, 5, 467498) It is good he came.
('86', 341, 3, 6, 467518) I have had talk with him.
('86', 341, 3, 7, 467544) AS a consequence we all feel that there is a danger of being misled if the committee functions at Allahabad.
('86', 341, 3, 8, 467653) Panditji said that those working on the Board 1 will be afraid of going to Wardha and may refuse to go there.
('86', 341, 3, 9, 467763) The implications of this are obnoxious.
('86', 341, 3, 10, 467803) The Sabha was born in Wardha.
('86', 341, 3, 11, 467833) It functioned in Wardha.
('86', 341, 3, 12, 467858) The work on thedictionary should be carried on in Wardha and, if I am to do this work and supervise the dictionary, the office of the Board should be in Wardha.
('86', 341, 3, 13, 468019) There will be nothing to worry about if, for the sake of convenience, some work is done in Allahabad.
('86', 341, 3, 14, 468121) A building was constructed in Wardha for this work.
('86', 341, 3, 15, 468173) Kakasaheb’s place is in Wardha.
('86', 341, 3, 16, 468205) I am, therefore, of the firm opinion that the headquarters of the Dictionary Board should be in Wardha.
('86', 341, 3, 17, 468309) If Akhtar works for us he should stay in Wardha.
('86', 341, 3, 18, 468358) It will be all right if your own share of work is for the most part sent on to you in Allahabad.
('86', 341, 3, 19, 468455) From this point of view, consideration of expenditure becomes secondary.
('86', 341, 3, 20, 468528) We should now make public the names of the members of the Board we have decided to form, shouldn’t we?
('86', 341, 3, 21, 468631) Panditji is writing to the persons concerned.
('86', 341, 3, 22, 468677) We have to have someone take the final decision about the work and then get it approved by the executive committee.
('86', 341, 3, 23, 468793) Isn’t that so?
('86', 341, 3, 24, 468808) According to the rules it should be like that.
('86', 341, 3, 25, 468855) Let me know your opinion.
('86', 341, 3, 26, 468881) I am here and in Panchgani till the end of June.
('86', 341, 3, 27, 468930) Panditji is of the opinion that I should be the constitutional head of the Board.
('86', 341, 3, 28, 469012) But I don’t think it is necessary.

('86', 342, 2, 3, 469345) MAGANBHAI, I have your letter.
('86', 342, 2, 4, 469376) What you write about Purushottam is right.
('86', 342, 2, 5, 469419) A man belonging to the Urdu Anjuman can also belong to our organization, can’t he?
('86', 342, 2, 6, 469502) Therefore those working for the Hindi Sammelan can also work for us.
('86', 342, 2, 7, 469571) I should maintain that policy as long as I am associated with the Sammelan work.
('86', 342, 2, 8, 469652) However, if that is against the policy of the Sammelan then I must leave.
('86', 342, 2, 9, 469726) I am considering this.
('86', 342, 2, 10, 469749) Please welcome Kosambi on my behalf.
('86', 342, 2, 11, 469786) I am in correspondence with Dr. Tarachand.
('86', 342, 2, 12, 469829) 1 We have formed a special committee at Wardha, haven’t we?
('86', 342, 2, 13, 469889) We shall do everything after consulting it and the General Body, shall we not?
('86', 342, 2, 14, 469968) My views on the future activities of the Vidyapith are as follows.
('86', 342, 2, 15, 470035) We must start implementing the ideas I have expressed on Nayee Talim.
('86', 342, 2, 16, 470105) That covers everything.
('86', 342, 2, 17, 470129) So there will be a revolutionary change in the existing schemes of the Vidyapiths.
('86', 342, 2, 18, 470212) The entire structure will change.
('86', 342, 2, 19, 470246) However, these changes won’t be effected artificially.
('86', 342, 2, 20, 470301) Whatever you wish to take from my speeches or discussions should be acted upon.
('86', 342, 2, 21, 470381) Can you understand from this what I have in mind?
('86', 342, 2, 22, 470431) Come to Panchgani if you want to know more.
('86', 342, 2, 23, 470475) It is your duty to persuade Narahari and take him with you.
('86', 342, 2, 24, 470535) You will have to take many in this way.
('86', 342, 2, 25, 470575) That is what is called institution ethics.
('86', 342, 2, 26, 470618) If that is not done only individual work will be done.
('86', 342, 2, 27, 470673) Now I have replied to all your questions.

('86', 345, 7, 12, 473956) MAHABALESHWAR, May [11/] 2 12, 1945
('86', 345, 8, 13, 473992) RAJAGOPALACHARI: The people, who are now saying they are doing your constructive work, are really parliamentarians but only one branch of it and they seek power through your unofficial influence, whereas other parliamentarians are seeking it through constitutional channels.
('86', 345, 8, 14, 474267) On the other hand, the only man who understands and can do your constructive work is myself.
('86', 345, 9, 15, 474360) GANDHIJI: Yes.
('86', 345, 10, 16, 474375) Are you thinking of dividing Congress work into functions?
('86', 345, 10, 17, 474434) I am not thinking of division of functions.
('86', 345, 10, 18, 474478) But there is a natural division.
('86', 345, 10, 19, 474511) But I have not thought (of) 3 compartments lower and higher.
('86', 345, 11, 20, 474572) It is like varna vyavastha.
('86', 345, 11, 21, 474600) Horizontal, never vertical.
('86', 345, 11, 22, 474628) But my conception certainly is that we can come to our own if all take up constructive work.
('86', 345, 12, 23, 474721) Parliamentary work will help constructive work.
('86', 345, 12, 24, 474769) But (constructive) work need
('86', 345, 13, 25, 474798) 1 The discussion is extracted from “Rajaji: Gandhiji’s Alter Ego” by Pyarelal, who says that the talks continued for two days.
('86', 345, 13, 26, 474925) However, only the last paragraph, under the date line May 12, 1945, is available in the G.N. source.
('86', 345, 13, 27, 475026) According to Pyarelal, Gandhiji wrote out his answers on slips of paper as he was “observing silence for a greater part of the day, under medical advice”.
('86', 345, 13, 28, 475181) 2 ibid 3 This and other parentheses are as in the source.
('86', 346, 0, 1, 475239) VOL. 86 : 4 MARCH, 1945 28 MAY, 1945 347
('86', 346, 1, 2, 475280) not necessarily be our whole care.
('86', 346, 1, 3, 475315) It replaces armed activity.
('86', 346, 1, 4, 475343) But we can never come to our own through parliamentary activity (alone).
('86', 346, 2, 5, 475416) If, on the one hand, no one outside can act on behalf of the Congress and, on the other, the British Government will not release the Working Committee members unless a basis of reconciliation has been authoritatively agreed to, there is an insoluble tangle.
('86', 346, 2, 6, 475674) Someone must some time or other act on behalf of the Congress and accept a scheme of settlement and, as a part of that scheme, the prisoners must be released.
('86', 346, 2, 7, 475833) You must, therefore, act on behalf of the Congress.
('86', 346, 2, 8, 475885) You know you are competent to do it.
('86', 346, 2, 9, 475922) You say that every Congressman may act on his own authority as if he were president.
('86', 346, 2, 10, 476007) But this is chaos.
('86', 346, 2, 11, 476026) Suppose now, there are a number of president candidates, the best man must win.
('86', 346, 2, 12, 476106) That is you.
('86', 346, 2, 13, 476119) The man who is in fact the best man to take up authority should take up responsibility at some time.
('86', 346, 2, 14, 476220) There is no use asking others to negotiate without committing the Congress.
('86', 346, 2, 15, 476296) There is no force behind Bhulabhai’s 1 efforts because you have not given 2 open and unreserved approval to his proposals.
('86', 346, 2, 16, 476419) It is only if you take up the authority like a dictator, can reasonable scheme of settlement have success.
('86', 346, 2, 17, 476526) You must take up authority on behalf of the Congress some time.
('86', 346, 2, 18, 476590) That point may be reached some time, but not now.
('86', 346, 3, 19, 476640) It may be that parliamentary activity will advance constructive work and that will help.
('86', 346, 3, 20, 476729) Then you hold my view or I yours.
('86', 346, 4, 21, 476763) As Churchill (was it Pritt 4?) has said, the courts are not beyond political influence.
('86', 346, 4, 22, 476851) This he said some years ago about Judge Granville over a heated political case involving judicial points.
('86', 346, 4, 23, 476957) In my case (in South Africa) it was a franchise question.
('86', 346, 4, 24, 477015) I lost because it was political.
('86', 346, 4, 25, 477048) I had engaged Asquith.
('86', 346, 5, 26, 477071) If Colville 6 (the Governor of Bombay) means it, he can say,
('86', 346, 6, 27, 477132) 1 Leader of the Congress Party in the Central Assembly, he was trying to end the political deadlock in the matter of Congress League coalition for the formation of a national government through talks with Liaquat Ali Khan, Deputy Leader of the Muslim League in the Central Assembly; the talks, however, failed.
('86', 346, 6, 28, 477443) 2 Vide “Note to Bhulabhai J. Desai”, 5 1 1945. 3 Pyarelal explains, rest of the discussion took place on May 12 and it was about he Asthi Chimur prisoners, which Gandhiji “made the acid test of Britis sincerity”.

('86', 347, 1, 3, 478042) Let us hope that Bhulabhai is on the qui vive.
('86', 347, 1, 4, 478089) I don’t mind if the examination is started.
('86', 347, 1, 5, 478133) 2 I simply feel that we shall have to go through these things, if the rulers are bent on crushing us.

('86', 347, 1, 8, 478367) I have put a limit to the price to be paid.

('86', 350, 3, 5, 483088) We should understand what Ambalal Sheth says.
('86', 350, 3, 6, 483134) He says, “You do make efforts.
('86', 350, 3, 7, 483165) But the labourers listen to you as long as it serves their purpose and when it comes to their doing their duty, they do not listen to you so that our scheme must fall flat.” It is beside the point whether the Sheth himself fulfils his part of the bargain.
('86', 350, 3, 8, 483421) What he does is of secondary importance to us.
('86', 350, 3, 9, 483468) Even so what you wrote to me about his shortcomings, you should write to himalso very frankly.
('86', 350, 3, 10, 483563) I am certainly with you.
('86', 350, 3, 11, 483588) I find immediate relief through allopathic medicine.

('86', 354, 4, 10, 489078) The experiment which Munnalal is conducting in regard to the ‘servants’ is good.
('86', 354, 4, 11, 489159) That is what should be done.
('86', 354, 4, 12, 489188) If it fails, it will show that our ahimsa is as yet very incomplete.
('86', 354, 4, 13, 489257) The error is one of under standing.
('86', 354, 4, 14, 489293) Let us not treat servants as servants but as brothers.
('86', 354, 4, 15, 489348) Even if they spoil things or steal or the expenses go up, it will not be in vain if we can consider them as members of the family.
('86', 354, 4, 16, 489479) Think it over.
('86', 354, 4, 17, 489494) I have instructed Chimanlal about the question of management.

('86', 359, 3, 5, 494585) I have read your letter.
('86', 359, 3, 6, 494610) It is my view that no one has the right to speak in the name of the Congress, not even members of the All India Working Committee who are out of jail.

('86', 359, 3, 16, 495243) I have not issued any circular.
('86', 359, 3, 17, 495275) 4 What was attributed to me must have been taken from an opinion expressed in a letter I wrote to someone in Ahmedabad.
('86', 359, 3, 18, 495395) All that it meant was that no one can issue orders in the name of the Congress.
('86', 359, 3, 19, 495475) Now as regards your restrictions.
('86', 359, 3, 20, 495509) So long as you do not regard yourself under control of the Government, whatever you wrote (in reply to the restriction order) was correct.

('86', 361, 10, 25, 499094) 1. Gandhiji has no recollection of having read the book 1 referred to by you.
('86', 361, 11, 26, 499172) 2. Impossible to say anything at this distance of time.
('86', 361, 12, 27, 499228) 1 In Mahatma Gandhi—The Last Phase, Vol. I, Book One, pp.
('86', 361, 12, 28, 499286) 101 2, Pyarelal explains that the addressee had written to Gandhiji that she was expecting to meet him at San Francisco Peace Conference, and thence to accompany him to India.
('86', 361, 12, 29, 499462) She had also suggested: “If you are short of secretaries to accompany you to the Peace Conference, call here on your way and I shall come along.” 2 Herman Kallenbach’s.
('86', 361, 12, 30, 499631) A German Jew who was with Gandhiji in South Africa, he died on March 25, 1945, in Johannesburg.
('86', 361, 12, 31, 499727) Vide also “Message on Death of Hermann Kallenbach”, 25 5 1945. 3 Alluding to the reports on Gandhiji’s illness, the addressee had said: “I was not greatly perturbed when you were ill (I regret your suffering, of course) because I felt confident that you would not depart hence until India was free .
('86', 361, 12, 32, 500027) I have not the slightest doubt that you will live until you are 125, if only you desire it.” 4 After Mother India by Harry H. Field.

('86', 362, 2, 3, 500311) 4. Please send an authentic copy of Mrs. Annette Helen Doharty’s affidavit referred to by you.
('86', 362, 2, 4, 500406) On the face of it, it seems to be a malicious invention.

('86', 362, 9, 14, 500739) Though you have given up khadi work as your means of livelihood, you still take interest in it and that is a good th ing.
('86', 362, 9, 15, 500861) I am taking all the measures I can think of.
('86', 362, 9, 16, 500906) Meet Kakubhai 1 and give him such useful help as he asks for and you can give.

('86', 363, 3, 4, 501391) SHAMALDAS 1, The enclosed is from your paper.
('86', 363, 3, 5, 501437) I feel that an advertisement which is immoral or is against the recognized or declared policy of the management should never be accepted.
('86', 363, 3, 6, 501575) No registered bhandar can sell khadi without yarn being tendered.
('86', 363, 3, 7, 501641) It should not escape your notice.
('86', 363, 3, 8, 501675) Therefore you should not accept this advertisement.
('86', 363, 3, 9, 501727) You should outright refuse this person.
('86', 363, 3, 10, 501767) For doing so you must impose restrictions on advertisements.
('86', 363, 3, 11, 501828) That involves some sacrifice and some scrutiny.
('86', 363, 3, 12, 501876) However, in the long run, you won’t lose anything but if you do it, it will be nothing more than the dirt on your palms 2. Do lose it.

('86', 364, 1, 3, 502653) That man is clever, no doubt.
('86', 364, 1, 4, 502683) He has done quite a lot of khadi work.
('86', 364, 1, 5, 502722) I have written to him that he should give you such occasional help as you feel he can give.
('86', 364, 1, 6, 502814) Make the bhandar an institution for learning.
('86', 364, 1, 7, 502860) Some should go there to learn the work and to spin also.
('86', 364, 1, 8, 502917) Others should pay for the lesson.
('86', 364, 1, 9, 502951) The poor should pay in the form of labour.

('86', 364, 6, 16, 503266) CHI LILI, I read your letter just now.
('86', 364, 6, 17, 503305) They handed it to me without opening it.
('86', 364, 6, 18, 503346) But I am going to give it to Narahari, Pyarelal, Munnalal and Hemantkumar to read.
('86', 364, 6, 19, 503429) That letter is a mirror of your soul.
('86', 364, 6, 20, 503467) You have always been, and still are, silly.
('86', 364, 6, 21, 503511) Remember the verse: “Dwelling in thought on vishayas.
('86', 364, 6, 22, 503565) ” 2 Here vishaya does not mean merely what it does in Gujarati, namely, immoral sex pleasure.
('86', 364, 6, 23, 503659) All objects of desire are vishayas, as for example, desiring what appeals to the eye, hearing with the ear, smelling with the nose, andother similar objects of sense.
('86', 364, 6, 24, 503826) Your object of desire is to come to the hills.
('86', 364, 6, 25, 503873) If it didn’t materialize you should forget about it.
('86', 364, 6, 26, 503926) But you would not be Lili if you could forget anything.
('86', 364, 6, 27, 503982) And that is why you suffer.
('86', 364, 6, 28, 504010) Otherwise there are few other women as fortunate as you.
('86', 364, 6, 29, 504067) Though married in the prime of your youth, you have remained a virgin all these years so that all the desire in you for that momentary pleasure has been burnt away.
('86', 364, 6, 30, 504232) You like service and get opportunities for it.
('86', 364, 6, 31, 504279) The best service you rendered was to Bhansali, then to Ramprasad and then to Krishnachandra.
('86', 364, 6, 32, 504372) I will not consider your services to Ba, Mahadev
('86', 364, 7, 33, 504421) 1 Vide “Letter to Amritlal Doshi”, 13 5 1945. 2 Bhagavad Gita.

('86', 365, 1, 2, 504526) and myself as there was attachment in that.
('86', 365, 1, 3, 504570) You are educating yourself to be a doctor entirely with the aim of dedicating yourself to public service.
('86', 365, 1, 4, 504676) What purer happiness than this could one have?
('86', 365, 1, 5, 504723) If you are still discontented, does it not mean that you are silly?
('86', 365, 1, 6, 504791) Hoshiari wishes to come to me, and so does Vina.
('86', 365, 1, 7, 504840) And there is no limit to the number of men who wish to come.
('86', 365, 1, 8, 504901) If they cannot come, does it mean that they are unfortunate?
('86', 365, 1, 9, 504962) You should completely burn up this desire of yours.
('86', 365, 1, 10, 505014) Hence, though from one point of view your letter is good, from another point of view it is one that you should withdraw, and that too, cheerfully.
('86', 365, 1, 11, 505161) You must pass, and do so with credit.
('86', 365, 1, 12, 505199) Afterwards you will be serving to your heart’s content.
('86', 365, 1, 13, 505255) And you do get opportunities from time to time, such as serving uncle.

('86', 365, 5, 22, 505676) That is not right.

('86', 368, 7, 24, 509897) My blessings to Prakashnarayan and the bride.
('86', 368, 7, 25, 509943) Normally I do not bless marriages contracted within the caste unless there is a special reason.
('86', 368, 7, 26, 510039) My fear is, this marriage will be one such.
('86', 368, 7, 27, 510083) Anyway, there is a special reason for my sending blessings for this marriage.
('86', 368, 7, 28, 510161) I have met Purnima.
('86', 368, 7, 29, 510181) She made a good impression on me.

('86', 370, 3, 4, 511655) BHAI RANGA, I have read what you have written about the tribes in the Nilgiris.
('86', 370, 3, 5, 511735) I wanted to write to you about it but in the mean time your letter came.
('86', 370, 3, 6, 511808) The article about the Nilgiris is good.
('86', 370, 3, 7, 511848) I congratulate you.
('86', 370, 3, 8, 511868) There should have been a glossary of the Indian words.
('86', 370, 3, 9, 511923) There should have been figures concerning their numbers.
('86', 370, 3, 10, 511980) You should have said something about their language.
('86', 370, 3, 11, 512033) You should have described their habits and customs in greater detail.
('86', 370, 3, 12, 512103) Do not drag me into the quarrel with the communists.
('86', 370, 3, 13, 512156) It concerns you people.
('86', 370, 3, 14, 512180) Before I say anything, it is necessary that I talk to them.
('86', 370, 3, 15, 512240) Going as far as that will be a waste of my time.
('86', 370, 3, 16, 512289) My place is to advise in more important matters.
('86', 370, 3, 17, 512338) Now I write in Hindustani even to South Indians.
('86', 370, 3, 18, 512387) But this is not without exceptions.
('86', 370, 3, 19, 512423) I hope you do not find it difficult to read letters such as this.
('86', 370, 3, 20, 512489) Do write to me in English, if you can’t write in Hindustani.
('86', 370, 3, 21, 512550) However, you should cultivate the habit of writing in Hindustani.

('86', 370, 8, 28, 512799) DEAR SIR TEJ, I was going to write to you in Hindustani but for this letter at least I restrain myself.
('86', 370, 8, 29, 512903) For the future I shall do as you will bid.

('86', 371, 1, 3, 513087) Rajaji told me otherwise.
('86', 371, 1, 4, 513113) Hence this note, though belated.
('86', 371, 1, 5, 513146) I considered the whole of your report as sketched to me to be an able document.
('86', 371, 1, 6, 513226) But I did not interest myself in the whole of it.
('86', 371, 1, 7, 513276) My interest was naturally confined to the communal question and it was wholly satisfactory.
('86', 371, 1, 8, 513368) I hope you do not want me to express any opinion on the rest.
('86', 371, 1, 9, 513430) You have, and that at your age, laboured at the report and laboured with your colleagues as few men would have done.
('86', 371, 1, 10, 513547) Rajaji has told me much about this part of your valuable work.
('86', 371, 1, 11, 513610) And in Santanam you have an able and painstaking secretary.
('86', 371, 1, 12, 513670) Hope you are keeping well and that your ailing son has recovered completely.

('86', 371, 6, 22, 514045) She and the sisters should do what they think fit.
('86', 371, 6, 23, 514096) It hurts me that Shyamlal’s affairs are disorganized.
('86', 371, 6, 24, 514150) You would not have told him about it and I do not want to say that he should use your name.
('86', 371, 6, 25, 514242) I am watching the developments.
('86', 371, 6, 26, 514274) Enough if you take care of your first division.

('86', 372, 3, 5, 514686) It would be only proper that the sisters hear everything and do whatever they want after due consideration.
('86', 372, 3, 6, 514794) Every place has advantages as well as disadvantages.
('86', 372, 3, 7, 514847) It is possible that Manu will not be able to get rid of her fear just by being told to do so.
('86', 372, 3, 8, 514941) It seems to be an ingrained trait.
('86', 372, 3, 9, 514976) If she recovers fully it will be a great achievement for us.
('86', 372, 3, 10, 515037) I take it that you will be coming back on the 16th.

('86', 372, 6, 16, 515449) If you wishto go either to Karachi or to Porbandar, by all means go.
('86', 372, 6, 17, 515518) What I am concerned with is that you should become strong in body and mind.
('86', 372, 6, 18, 515594) If you can do it there, I shall be pleased.
('86', 372, 6, 19, 515638) Because of your negligent habits, I thought that, if you could overcome your fear, you would be able to benefit fully and for long from the mountain air.
('86', 372, 6, 20, 515792) However I am not enamoured of hill stations either.
('86', 372, 6, 21, 515844) Wherever you stay with a free mind, you are bound to benefit.
('86', 372, 6, 22, 515906) You may, therefore, do what your sisters desire.
('86', 372, 6, 23, 515955) I give my consent for it.
('86', 372, 7, 24, 515981) Why should we observe anybody’s face?
('86', 372, 7, 25, 516019) We may even make a mistake in judging a person from his face.
('86', 372, 7, 26, 516081) We are not God.
('86', 372, 7, 27, 516097) We might even do him injustice.
('86', 372, 7, 28, 516129) And moreover, when one has made up one’s mind not to fear anybody, why need one know the other person’s mind?

('86', 375, 7, 31, 520163) In any case, Sailen must give something.
('86', 375, 7, 32, 520204) If you run a free hospital, it will get filled up and no one will be benefited.
('86', 375, 7, 33, 520284) That can be discussed when we have the time.
('86', 375, 7, 34, 520329) I have written to Sailen to go to you and show my postcard.

('86', 376, 8, 13, 521185) He is a deserving man.
('86', 376, 8, 14, 521208) This talk about castes has become outmoded.

('86', 379, 3, 6, 524094) We have said “No” to him, and we should stick, to it.

('86', 379, 3, 12, 524303) We cannot control her mind.
('86', 379, 3, 13, 524331) I have already suggested one remedy for Shakaribehn.
('86', 379, 3, 14, 524384) Another is to take the treatment of Dr. Ice.
('86', 379, 3, 15, 524429) He can easily deal with such a complaint.
('86', 379, 3, 16, 524471) There is no harm in your having detained Saroj.

('86', 379, 8, 28, 525057) If there have been changes, do let me know.

('86', 380, 1, 3, 525529) Some of what has been written is meant only to malign me.
('86', 380, 1, 4, 525587) Some show a lack of understanding, some ignorance.
('86', 380, 1, 5, 525638) Then again some of it is written with a view to publication and largely for money.
('86', 380, 1, 6, 525721) It is immaterial whether people are convinced by my reply or not.
('86', 380, 1, 7, 525787) Those, with whose criticism I have dealt, have certainly been convinced.
('86', 380, 1, 8, 525860) Some would like it more if I dispensed with the distinction I have laid down in my article.
('86', 380, 1, 9, 525952) But how could I do that?
('86', 380, 1, 10, 525977) Varnavyavastha will not cease to be beneficial by our not being aware of its benefits.
('86', 380, 1, 11, 526064) That the meaning of varna needs to be properly understood is another question.
('86', 380, 1, 12, 526143) The difference pointed out by you seems correct.
('86', 380, 1, 13, 526192) It would certainly be good if my articles on varna, etc., are published.
('86', 380, 1, 14, 526265) No omissions and additions should be made before getting them published.
('86', 380, 1, 15, 526338) Even if I had the time I would make no changes.
('86', 380, 1, 16, 526386) However, I would explain 1 my present stand in detail.
('86', 380, 1, 17, 526441) Study them if you have the time and the will.
('86', 380, 1, 18, 526487) I shall be ready to go through your work.
('86', 380, 1, 19, 526529) But do not at all think that it is your duty to do this work.

('86', 384, 3, 7, 530218) It has become your profession and your mission to transform the art of spinning into a science and make it interesting.

('86', 385, 7, 14, 532082) I sent your letter on to Sevagram because I thought it was good.
('86', 385, 7, 15, 532147) Now it appears that I did not write at all.
('86', 385, 7, 16, 532191) But now it is to be understood that you are to write, whether I write or not.Vimala must be well.
('86', 385, 7, 17, 532289) It is not right that she does not write.
('86', 385, 7, 18, 532330) I must know if it is because of illness.
('86', 385, 7, 19, 532371) But if it is because of laziness, she is guilty.

('86', 387, 5, 7, 533831) One of the first and best pupils of the late lamented Dr. P. C. Ray, Shri Satis Chandra Das Gupta is a fit person to bring under one cover all the available literature on the cow rightly called the ‘Mother of Prosperity’.
('86', 387, 5, 8, 534053) By convincing arguments based on copious reading of which he has reproduced the relevant parts in the volume, the author has dispelled the belief held even by learned men that India’s cattle are a burden upon the land and divide its production with the people to the latter’s detriment.
('86', 387, 5, 9, 534340) He shows the usefulness of the cow as the giver of milk, the producer of draught bullocks, the manurer of our fields and after death the giver of her hide and bone.
('86', 387, 5, 10, 534505) He proves the superiority of cattle over the engine for ploughing the fields of India.
('86', 387, 5, 11, 534592) He establishes the inevitable connection and interdependence between the cattle and other animal life, the earth and man.
('86', 387, 5, 12, 534714) Lastly, he proves the superiority of the cow over the buffalo, not so that the latter should be killed off or starved out but so that the buffalo should not be favoured at the expense of the cow as is done at the present moment.
('86', 387, 5, 13, 534943) I commend the volume to the lover of the cow as also to everyone who would learn that the slaughter of cattle for food is a pure economic waste and know how he can turn the cow into a giver of plenty instead of being the giver of scanty which, owing to criminal negligence, she has become today.

('86', 388, 5, 9, 535651) She has become very weak.
('86', 388, 5, 10, 535677) In these circumstances, you must either go yourself or send someone.

('86', 388, 5, 13, 535858) You yourself should decide.
('86', 388, 5, 14, 535886) Kanchan also is tired of the place.
('86', 388, 5, 15, 535922) She must, therefore, return.

('86', 390, 1, 2, 537852) 681. HOW TO IMPROVE VILLAGE INDUSTRIES
('86', 390, 2, 3, 537891) May 21, 1945 I have distinguished other village industries from khadi and called them planets and the charkha or the spinning wheel the sun.
('86', 390, 2, 4, 538032) As a matter of fact there is no real reason for such a distinction, for khadi is also a village industry.
('86', 390, 2, 5, 538138) But it has acquired a special position, and it is because of this special position which it has acquired that we can now talk about the other village industries.
('86', 390, 2, 6, 538300) Today we are not required to demonstrate the special position acquired by khadi but we are required to discover ways and means of putting it and other village industries on a firm footing.
('86', 390, 2, 7, 538489) One of the ways is to resort to centralized production of necessities through machinery worked by power and requiring the minimum of human labour.
('86', 390, 2, 8, 538636) This results in increasing the number of the rich few and making it a dharma to multiply the people’s wants.
('86', 390, 2, 9, 538745) Even if all such centralized industries were to be State owned, it would make no difference to me.
('86', 390, 2, 10, 538844) For the obligation to increase wants will not only not decrease, but may be strengthened where such industries are owned by the State.
('86', 390, 2, 11, 538979) Only the task of increasing wants will pass from the hands of small capitalists to the bigger capitalists, or the State, whose action will secure the seal of public support.
('86', 390, 2, 12, 539153) This is how things are going in England and America.
('86', 390, 2, 13, 539206) I am purposely leaving out Russia; because their work is still continuing, I shall not at this stage dare to assess the result.
('86', 390, 2, 14, 539334) I hope that Russia will produce something unique.
('86', 390, 2, 15, 539384) But I must confess that I have my doubts whether it will truly succeed.
('86', 390, 2, 16, 539456) I shall consider it a great success if, through it, all the wealth really goes into the hands of the poor, and intellectual and personal freedom is at the same time secured.
('86', 390, 2, 17, 539630) In that case I will have to revise my present concept of ahimsa.
('86', 390, 2, 18, 539695) Now I come to the main point.
('86', 390, 2, 19, 539725) In England and America, machinery rules supreme.
('86', 390, 2, 20, 539774) On the contrary, in India we have village industries, symbolizing the resurgence of human labour.
('86', 390, 2, 21, 539872) In the West, a handful of persons with the aid of mechanical power rule over others.
('86', 390, 2, 22, 539957) In India, on the other hand, the great task of bringing out whatis best in every individual is being attempted by the A. I. S. A., A. I. V. I. A. and other allied institutions.
('86', 390, 2, 23, 540134) From this point of view the growth of Western civilization seems to be an easy thing, but to develop a

('86', 391, 1, 2, 540279) organize the latent capacities of individuals through village industries appears to be a very difficult task.
('86', 391, 1, 3, 540389) Looking at it from another point of view, it may be said that, for a handful of men to rule over other men with the aid of steam and other power will be harmful in the end, as it is bound to multiply injustice.
('86', 391, 1, 4, 540600) By using the human power available to us by the million, injustice is reduced.
('86', 391, 1, 5, 540679) And there is no room for failure.
('86', 391, 1, 6, 540713) For here, along with human power, we rely on divine Power.
('86', 391, 1, 7, 540772) In the other method, no value is attached to divine Power.
('86', 391, 1, 8, 540831) In short, if in the case of village industries we do not truly obtain God’s help, we are bound to fail.
('86', 391, 1, 9, 540935) The Western method only appears to be successful, but in truth there is nothing but failure in it.
('86', 391, 1, 10, 541034) For it destroys the will to work.

('86', 394, 3, 7, 544750) I have an impression that I have written to Surendraji.
('86', 394, 3, 8, 544806) If he does not want to wait till I reach Wardha, he can come to Panchgani.

('86', 394, 3, 10, 544913) But I leave it to him to decide.

('86', 394, 3, 13, 545024) Khadi Vidyalaya, Goshala, Village Industries and other such activities can take up considerable time.

('86', 395, 3, 10, 546403) I should like you to do it there.
('86', 395, 3, 11, 546437) You know that is what I have always done.

('86', 398, 8, 21, 551099) One feels pleasant in the sun.
('86', 398, 8, 22, 551130) The difference in altitude between this place and Panchgani is 500 ft.
('86', 398, 8, 23, 551201) But here it rains so heavily that one cannot stay on after the rains start in June.

('86', 399, 3, 4, 551471) JAI SUKHL AL, So Manu has returned there at last, not restored in health but broken both in body and mind.
('86', 399, 3, 5, 551578) The two react on each other.
('86', 399, 3, 6, 551607) She is of course responsible for the weakening of both.
('86', 399, 3, 7, 551663) The atmosphere also may be responsible, but man’s strength lies in overcoming his surroundings.
('86', 399, 3, 8, 551759) I could not teach this to her fully.
('86', 399, 3, 9, 551796) She is consumed by fear.
('86', 399, 3, 10, 551821) She herself is the cause of that fear.
('86', 399, 3, 11, 551860) It has become an occupation with her to listen to others, then get upset and jumpy and start crying, and she studies only when she gets some free time from this.
('86', 399, 3, 12, 552022) She is filled with the highest spirit of service, is interested in learning and is of loving nature.
('86', 399, 3, 13, 552123) Like me, she also suffers from amoebiasis and hookworm.
('86', 399, 3, 14, 552179) I keep the infection under control, but she does not.
('86', 399, 3, 15, 552233) Do now whatever suggests itself to you as best.
('86', 399, 3, 16, 552281) She can always come back to me.
('86', 399, 3, 17, 552313) I will never leave her.

('86', 399, 9, 27, 552580) I am answering this at once.
('86', 399, 9, 28, 552609) It is all right that you have gone to Karachi.
('86', 399, 9, 29, 552656) But you must get rid of the amoeba and hook worm.
('86', 399, 9, 30, 552706) But how can you manage to do so, if you are returning on the 4th?
('86', 399, 9, 31, 552772) In any case, do not take that vaid’s treatment.
('86', 399, 9, 32, 552820) If you decide to stay on there, do so with a firm resolution to get rid of your illness.
('86', 399, 9, 33, 552909) Do not be anxious to appear for the examination.
('86', 399, 9, 34, 552958) If you can easily manage to read a little, it will be all right.
('86', 399, 9, 35, 553023) I can see from your letter that you are consumed by the fear of the surrounding atmosphere.
('86', 399, 9, 36, 553115) The world will always frighten those who let themselves be frightened.
('86', 399, 9, 37, 553186) You would, therefore, do well to cast all fear into the sea.

('86', 402, 9, 12, 556515) Mahatma Gandhi said that the national song which they had sung to welcome him praised ‘Bharatmata’ and struck a victorious note but the present time was not the one in which one could indulge in joyous celebrations.
('86', 402, 9, 13, 556731) India was now in the same plight as Draupadi was at one time and it was a matter to be seriously considered whether that should be an occasion to celebrate.
('86', 402, 9, 14, 556888) In the song they had sung,there occurred the motto “Do or Die”.
('86', 402, 9, 15, 556952) That should encourage them to carry on the fight for the liberation of the motherland without rest.
('86', 402, 9, 16, 557052) It was the natural duty of the young to carry on the fight for freedom but at the same time they should not allow the old to take rest.

('86', 402, 10, 19, 557421) The King had rejected their mercy petition; vide “Statement to the Press”, 31 3 1945. But a lacuna in the order was discovered by the defence counsel, and the executions were stayed.
('86', 402, 10, 20, 557604) Later, owing to Gandhiji’s efforts, on August 16, 1945, the Viceroy commuted the sentences to life imprisonment.

('86', 405, 3, 8, 560736) Are you studying for the examination or for knowledge?
('86', 405, 3, 9, 560791) An examination is only yardstick, but knowledge is the end [the reality].

('86', 405, 7, 23, 561666) NIM U, I have received your long letter just now.
('86', 405, 7, 24, 561716) I will not say that you have been lazy and so have saved yourself from writing to me.
('86', 405, 7, 25, 561802) Today you had no escape from writing.
('86', 405, 7, 26, 561840) That is as it should be.
('86', 405, 7, 27, 561865) I love to have letters from all of you but I will not expect them from anyone.
('86', 405, 7, 28, 561944) I have a letter from Sumi which I am sending you.
('86', 405, 7, 29, 561994) I have lovingly rebuked her about the examination.
('86', 405, 7, 30, 562045) 2 Ask her to send you the

('86', 406, 1, 2, 562197) letter.
('86', 406, 1, 3, 562205) Do not send for her there.
('86', 406, 1, 4, 562232) Her eyes will be harmed.
('86', 406, 1, 5, 562257) Everything can be done in Delhi.
('86', 406, 1, 6, 562290) If you want to go and take Usha with you, you may go.
('86', 406, 1, 7, 562344) Kanam will look after himself.
('86', 406, 1, 8, 562375) However, I want you not to leave Ramdas.
('86', 406, 1, 9, 562416) My advice is that you should entrust Sumi to Devdas and Lakshmi.
('86', 406, 1, 10, 562481) If Sumi can manage without you, let her do so.
('86', 406, 1, 11, 562528) If you people go, Devdas will certainly have to bear some burden.
('86', 406, 1, 12, 562594) Lakshmi is very good natured and affectionate.
('86', 406, 1, 13, 562641) But her health is delicate.
('86', 406, 1, 14, 562669) She has just left childbed.
('86', 406, 1, 15, 562697) It will be a different thing if you go there and take charge of cooking, etc.
('86', 406, 1, 16, 562775) You will not be able to do that; so your place is in Nagpur with Ramdas.
('86', 406, 1, 17, 562848) It will be enough if you can make Sumi give up her infatuation for reading.
('86', 406, 1, 18, 562924) It is not through reading that one can think.
('86', 406, 1, 19, 562970) What is the advantage of mere cramming?
('86', 406, 1, 20, 563010) Devdas will manage.
('86', 406, 1, 21, 563030) Lakshmi can also manage.
('86', 406, 1, 22, 563055) The doctors in Delhi are good.
('86', 406, 1, 23, 563086) It is a consolation that Sumi likes being there.
('86', 406, 1, 24, 563135) You have to persuade Ramdas.
('86', 406, 1, 25, 563164) He should continue with Mehta for a long period.
('86', 406, 1, 26, 563213) That was what he decided when he was here with me.
('86', 406, 1, 27, 563264) If you wish, you can win him over and make him do what you want.
('86', 406, 1, 28, 563329) No one else has that power.
('86', 406, 1, 29, 563357) I had it once.
('86', 406, 1, 30, 563372) But not now, because I am not able to pay much attention to him.
('86', 406, 1, 31, 563437) My attention has been divided these days.
('86', 406, 1, 32, 563479) Kanam will come and see me either here or at Panchgani.
('86', 406, 1, 33, 563535) I have a letter from him.
('86', 406, 1, 34, 563561) I have given him the permission.
('86', 406, 1, 35, 563594) Manilal and Devdas left yesterday.
('86', 406, 1, 36, 563629) Most probably Sushila will not come to the hill station.
('86', 406, 1, 37, 563686) She will come only to Sevagram.

('86', 407, 9, 14, 564253) However, you have written good English.
('86', 407, 9, 15, 564293) What you write, I did not know.
('86', 407, 9, 16, 564325) My advice is the same as I have already given.
('86', 407, 9, 17, 564372) You should humbly try to persuade your father.
('86', 407, 9, 18, 564419) I have not the least doubt that your true happiness lies in accepting my advice.
('86', 407, 9, 19, 564500) The times are to be thanked for what has happened.
('86', 407, 9, 20, 564551) There is no need at all for you to lose your head over what has happened or is happening.
('86', 407, 9, 21, 564641) Do what is proper and that will certainly give you peace.

('86', 408, 2, 3, 564901) MAHABALAESHWAR, May 23, 1945
('86', 408, 3, 4, 564930) BAPA, What you decided was right.
('86', 408, 3, 5, 564964) I am not waiting to consult Mridula.
('86', 408, 3, 6, 565001) 1 How can I remember what I told her and why should I?
('86', 408, 3, 7, 565056) This I know I said: “I will not give my decision without knowing Bapa’s opinion.” I certainly will not be a party to keeping a large number of persons as paid employees.
('86', 408, 3, 8, 565226) Therefore I shall comply with your decision.
('86', 408, 3, 9, 565271) The doctor has left today.
('86', 408, 3, 10, 565298) I would like it if Amba and Prabhudas stayed there.
('86', 408, 3, 11, 565350) Only yesterday I received a letter from him.
('86', 408, 3, 12, 565395) His preference appears to be for staying at Hapur.
('86', 408, 3, 13, 565446) If you can draw him into your work, do so.
('86', 408, 3, 14, 565489) He is a very useful man.
('86', 408, 3, 15, 565514) But he has become weak.
('86', 408, 3, 16, 565538) So for the two together you may have to pay as much as Rs. 200, because Prabhudas will need plenty of milk, fruit, ghee and green vegetables.
('86', 408, 3, 17, 565680) He has gone through a pretty hard time.
('86', 408, 3, 18, 565720) In view of his state of health you will have to permit him to go somewhere else in extreme summer.
('86', 408, 3, 19, 565819) It is possible that Prabhudas will agree to accept a little less.
('86', 408, 3, 20, 565885) But I would not consider it proper.
('86', 408, 3, 21, 565921) His daughters too are sensible and, in my view, quite capable.
('86', 408, 3, 22, 565984) So between all of them I would not consider that salary too high.
('86', 408, 3, 23, 566050) It is necessary that he should be free of anxiety about the money.
('86', 408, 3, 24, 566117) Do not neglect your eyes.
('86', 408, 3, 25, 566143) Do not spoil your health.
('86', 408, 3, 26, 566169) I know that you are more careless than I. You have so far got along.
('86', 408, 3, 27, 566238) You may even be tempted to do more.
('86', 408, 3, 28, 566274) But you will not benefit by that.
('86', 408, 3, 29, 566308) “Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.” 2 Jesus had said this on a different occasion.
('86', 408, 3, 30, 566396) I do not recollect at the moment its Hindustani or Sanskrit equivalent.
('86', 408, 3, 31, 566468) I have filled one sheet of paper.

('86', 409, 3, 4, 566767) I had not read the last portion carefully.
('86', 409, 3, 5, 566810) But I think I have grasped the purport of the whole thing.
('86', 409, 3, 6, 566869) I do not propose to answer your points.
('86', 409, 3, 7, 566909) This is what I advise : We must not spend so much time in preparing questions.
('86', 409, 3, 8, 566988) We must take whatever work we can with ease and be patient with regard to the rest.
('86', 409, 3, 9, 567072) You do not have to move only with me.
('86', 409, 3, 10, 567110) I have provided you a great institution.
('86', 409, 3, 11, 567151) Now it is for you to prove your worth.
('86', 409, 3, 12, 567190) You must play the main part in winning over Bapa.
('86', 409, 3, 13, 567240) I might be of help to you, but if you do not like what I do, or my method of doing it, it is difficult for me to say what you should do.
('86', 409, 3, 14, 567377) Some words of yours have given me that impression.
('86', 409, 3, 15, 567428) You do not like the Ashram and I have been constantly wondering how anyone who does not like the Ashram can like me.
('86', 409, 3, 16, 567545) I blame myself for that.
('86', 409, 3, 17, 567570) It is a case of my being liked but not my work.
('86', 409, 3, 18, 567618) You alone must sit down at leisure and find a solution.
('86', 409, 3, 19, 567674) But what is to be done when leisure is something you cannot afford ?
('86', 409, 3, 20, 567743) How long must I go on writing like this ?
('86', 409, 3, 21, 567785) A word to the wise should suffice.

('86', 412, 7, 13, 570414) MAHABALESHWAR, May 24, 1945 I was glad to meet you any time and so I said ‘Yes’ to Joshi.
('86', 412, 7, 14, 570504) But these two questions could have been answered in two lines.
('86', 412, 7, 15, 570567) My correspondence with Joshi was never confidential.
('86', 412, 7, 16, 570620) In any event it can be published at once.
('86', 412, 7, 17, 570662) I think I have said as much in one of my letters.
('86', 412, 7, 18, 570712) I can’t hasten Bhulabhai.
('86', 412, 7, 19, 570738) I have sent him the papers I could.
('86', 412, 7, 20, 570774) He could give his opinion any day he chose.
('86', 412, 7, 21, 570818) 2 My fear is that it won’t be an award.
('86', 412, 7, 22, 570858) It would be the opinion of a distinguished lawyer on the papersin my possession.
('86', 412, 7, 23, 570939) But my own opinion is not formed.
('86', 412, 7, 24, 570973) I want to pass no hasty judgment.
('86', 412, 7, 25, 571007) Many honest Congressmen come to me or
('86', 412, 8, 26, 571045) 1 This was in reply to a request from Mohan Kumaramangalam on P. C. Joshi’s behalf to publish the correspondence that had passed between Gandhiji and P. C. Joshi.
('86', 412, 8, 27, 571208) 2 Bhulabhai Desai, who was preoccupied and also not keeping well, was one of the members of a tribunal suggested by the communists to have the charges against them examined.
('86', 412, 8, 28, 571382) Giving his opinion on August 20, 1945, Desai said that P. C. Joshi had admitted that the war which has ended was a ‘people’s war’ and that since August 9, 1942, the Communist Party was propagating views contrary to that of the Congress.

('86', 413, 1, 3, 571838) I am not going to base my opinion on this evidence either.
('86', 413, 1, 4, 571897) I dare not condemn you, Batliwala, Joshi or Habib of Lucknow.

('86', 413, 1, 7, 572133) I do not want to pass judgment against a political party.
('86', 413, 1, 8, 572191) I tell friends to be guided by their own knowledge and not by my judgment which may be erring for want of complete evidence.

('86', 413, 5, 13, 572513) Well then, do so.
('86', 413, 5, 14, 572531) But divide the responsibility and do only such work as you can wihtout having to move about.
('86', 413, 5, 15, 572624) Look after the accounts and such supervisory work as you can.
('86', 413, 5, 16, 572686) If anyone wishes to be the Manager, let him, and help him.
('86', 413, 5, 17, 572745) A day has to come when it will be necessary for someone to be the Manager, for I must some day die and so must you.
('86', 413, 5, 18, 572861) After that someone will have to become the Manager.
('86', 413, 5, 19, 572913) Your wisdom and, if you wish, mine, also lies in training a person for it while we are still alive.
('86', 413, 5, 20, 573013) Manage things somehow during our lifetime.

('86', 415, 3, 12, 575487) No doubt, I did plenty of work.
('86', 415, 3, 13, 575519) I sat at a stretch for four hours at a meeting of the trustees.
('86', 415, 3, 14, 575583) But that was enough for me.
('86', 415, 3, 15, 575611) There is such a difference between four hours and twenty hours.

('86', 416, 2, 6, 576698) I am sending it after signing.
('86', 416, 2, 7, 576729) You must get rid of your pride.
('86', 416, 2, 8, 576761) There was nothing to feel shy about in your letter.
('86', 416, 2, 9, 576813) You explained to me your condition in a simple manner and that is why I used my prerogative.
('86', 416, 2, 10, 576906) Whatever I think worth keeping confidential, I keep confidential.
('86', 416, 2, 11, 576972) But a person who has faith in God should never keep his personal matters confidential.
('86', 416, 2, 12, 577059) Confidential means most personal.
('86', 416, 2, 13, 577093) “Renounce and enjoy” includes “confidential” also.

('86', 416, 4, 24, 577731) For the time being you should not read or write.
('86', 416, 5, 25, 577780) Now about Hariji.
('86', 416, 5, 26, 577798) Your opinion is correct.
('86', 416, 5, 27, 577823) Even if he has acquired complete mastery, we should let Rameshwaribehn 1 come in.

('86', 418, 14, 21, 580583) I keep receiving letters in Urdu, Hindi and Gujarati all asking me how I can be both in the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan and the Hindustani [Prachar] Sabha at the same time.
('86', 418, 14, 22, 580751) They say that according to the Sammelan Hindi alone can be our national language and the Nagari script alone can be given national status, whereas I concede national status both to the Nagari and Urdu scripts and to a language that is neither too Persianized nor too Sanskritized.
('86', 418, 14, 23, 581032) When I do not accord exclusive national status to the language propagated by the Sammelan and the Nagari script, I ought to get out of the Sammelan.
('86', 418, 14, 24, 581181) It seems to me a valid argument.
('86', 418, 14, 25, 581214) Does it not then become my duty to leave the Sammelan?
('86', 418, 14, 26, 581269) By my doing so people will not be in a dilemma and I shall know where I stand.

('86', 420, 4, 7, 582396) Dr. Patel whom you mention is dead.
('86', 420, 4, 8, 582432) Now there is one Dr. Jesudasan at the hospital.

('86', 420, 9, 20, 582771) DIN SHAW,
('86', 420, 10, 21, 582781) I received your letter just now in the evening.
('86', 420, 10, 22, 582829) I understand about Mavalankar.
('86', 420, 10, 23, 582860) Our duty is to pick up a gem even if it is lying in garbage heap and to cherish it.
('86', 420, 10, 24, 582944) I have seen with my own eyes how thousands of maunds of rubble is dug up from the bowels of the earthin order to extract a few ounces of diamond.
('86', 420, 10, 25, 583090) The question of money is different.
('86', 420, 10, 26, 583126) Mavalankar joined us because his father is very generous and also very particular.
('86', 420, 10, 27, 583209) You have given a correct reply to Shah.
('86', 420, 10, 28, 583249) You will have kept the money from him as fees.
('86', 420, 10, 29, 583296) I have of course written to him that he should send you the money.
('86', 420, 10, 30, 583363) I was glad you did not come.
('86', 420, 10, 31, 583392) If I fall ill, I will call you; but if I am all right I can do with any sort of massage I get.
('86', 420, 10, 32, 583487) Rather than have massage from you I should prefer your staying there to look after the patients and perfect the institution.
('86', 420, 10, 33, 583612) I do not want to eat up the plant to its root because it tastes sweet.
('86', 420, 10, 34, 583683) I had right away written 1 to Gulbehn that she could come.
('86', 420, 10, 35, 583742) Now the weather here has also improved.

('86', 423, 7, 18, 587331) Longden, among other things, raised the questions of Dominion Status v.
('86', 423, 7, 19, 587403) Independence, the Hindu Muslim question, responsibility for the August 1942 disturbances and possibility of Congress co operation in the war effort.
('86', 423, 7, 20, 587552) Mahatma Gandhi is said to have replied that the question of Dominion Status v.
('86', 423, 7, 21, 587631) Independence could be decided after the principle of independence for India had been accepted by the British Government.
('86', 423, 7, 22, 587752) On the Hindu Muslim question, Mahatma Gandhi is understood to have said that Hindus who had been converted to Islam could not claim separate nationhood by virtue of a change of religion.

('86', 423, 8, 24, 588063) According to the A. P. I. report, Longden “was told by Gandhiji that his vow of silence prevented a discussion but that written answers could be given to written questions”.
('86', 424, 0, 1, 588237) VOL. 86 : 4 MARCH, 1945 28 MAY, 1945 425
('86', 424, 1, 2, 588278) As regards the August 1942 disturbances, Mahatma Gandhi is said to have declared that the Government themselves have absolved him of charge of “treachery” and of trying to assist the Japanese.
('86', 424, 1, 3, 588471) Mahatma Gandhi had informed Maj.
('86', 424, 1, 4, 588504) Longden that though he had no objection to the publication of the questions and answers he thought it would be inadvisable to publish them at this stage and Maj.
('86', 424, 1, 5, 588666) Longden agreed.

('86', 424, 3, 7, 588714) 742. FOREWORD TO “GITAGITMANJARI”
('86', 424, 4, 8, 588748) I have discovered no easy way of enjoying the music of songs.
('86', 424, 4, 9, 588810) I cannot, therefore, easily drink in the joy that they are capable of giving.
('86', 424, 4, 10, 588888) It has happened sometimes that when a song was sung in a manner I found sweet, I fully enjoyed it and also understood its meaning.
('86', 424, 4, 11, 589019) Sometimes I myself have been able to hum the tune of a song, and then I have both fully enjoyed the music and understood the meaning.
('86', 424, 4, 12, 589153) Jugatram 1 has requested such a person—with much hesitation— to say a few words by way of blessings.
('86', 424, 4, 13, 589254) “With much hesitation” because he knows the value of my time, as also my limitations.
('86', 424, 4, 14, 589340) If, in spite of that, he has requested my blessings, the reason is that I look upon the Gita as a lexicon of the soul.
('86', 424, 4, 15, 589459) I have not been able to read the Manjari from beginning to end.
('86', 424, 4, 16, 589523) But I have carefully glanced through it.
('86', 424, 4, 17, 589564) I liked the work.
('86', 424, 4, 18, 589582) The author’s labour is evident.
('86', 424, 4, 19, 589614) Jugatram has, in his own manner, put into song what he has liked in the different chapters of the Gita.
('86', 424, 4, 20, 589718) The glossary following the Preface in the Manjari, the selected passages from Gitabodh 2 and Anasaktiyog, which are relevant to the context, and the relevant verses from the Gita are likely to prove useful to a serious student of the work.
('86', 424, 4, 21, 589958) Jugatram has not come to the end of his journey.
('86', 424, 4, 22, 590007) He has come as far as Chapter 12. Let us hope that he will be able to complete the journey.
('86', 424, 4, 23, 590099) He has done well also to include, after the 60th manjari, the songs written for Kakasaheb’s Be Keri 3.
('86', 424, 5, 24, 590202) 1 Jugatram Dave 2 Vide “Letters on Gita”, 11 11 1930. 3 Literally, “Two Mangoes”; a Gujarati play written by D. B. Kalelkar; the follow ing item.
('86', 425, 0, 1, 590348) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 426
('86', 425, 1, 2, 590390) The student should also know that Jugatram practises the teaching of the Gita as he has understood it, and is one of the few who draw from the fountain of milk unceasingly flowing from it.
('86', 425, 1, 3, 590579) Hence anybody who wishes to enjoy the fragrance of this Manjari should touch it only if he wishes to practise the teaching of the Gita and work in the spirit of non attachment, or derive strength for such work.

('86', 425, 6, 8, 590926) May 27, 1945
('86', 425, 7, 9, 590939) JUG ATRAM , You have given me a good job indeed.
('86', 425, 7, 10, 590988) Here is the Foreword 1, or whatever you care to call it.
('86', 425, 7, 11, 591045) It took more than four hours of my time to write it.
('86', 425, 7, 12, 591098) For me that is too much.
('86', 425, 7, 13, 591123) But I had no choice.
('86', 425, 7, 14, 591144) I like such jobs, but I am no longer fit for them.
('86', 425, 7, 15, 591195) The work which I have planned to do here takes most of my time, or rather all the time that I get.
('86', 425, 7, 16, 591294) My purpose in writing this is not to reproach you for giving me a job like this but, through you, to stop others from doing the same.
('86', 425, 7, 17, 591428) How can I reproach you?
('86', 425, 7, 18, 591452) And then you have written Manjari only to help me in my work.
('86', 425, 7, 19, 591514) Isn’t that so?
('86', 425, 7, 20, 591529) This is no mere rhetoric.
('86', 425, 7, 21, 591555) You have called the ninth manjari “Samata Yoga” and the 40th “Samata”.
('86', 425, 7, 22, 591626) You will observe that the word ‘samata’ bears two different meanings in the two places.
('86', 425, 7, 23, 591714) I would call the ninth “Samata”, dropping “Yoga”, and the 40th “Samatva” or “Samabhava”.
('86', 425, 7, 24, 591803) The reason is plain.
('86', 425, 7, 25, 591824) The discussion of Chapter 12 ends at the 60th manjari.
('86', 425, 7, 26, 591879) I see from the contents that you have included something from Be Keri.
('86', 425, 7, 27, 591950) There should be some mention of it, on p.
('86', 425, 7, 28, 591992) 152 2. Think over it.
('86', 425, 7, 29, 592014) If something can be done about it, do so.

('86', 426, 2, 3, 592318) “MORARJI CASTLE”, MAHABALESHWAR, May 27, 1945 THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BOMBAY HOME DEPARTMENT BOMBAY
('86', 426, 3, 4, 592429) DEAR SIR, I refer you to my letter 1 of 6th May, 1944, written from the Detention Camp.
('86', 426, 3, 5, 592517) Up till recently there has been no hitch about friends and relatives going to the samadhis of the two departed ones, my wife and Shri Mahadev Desai.
('86', 426, 3, 6, 592666) But a hitch occurred recently.
('86', 426, 3, 7, 592697) Tactful handling made devotion fairly possible during fixed hours.
('86', 426, 3, 8, 592764) Now comes the rumour that H. H. the Aga Khan’s Palace is about to be occupied by the Military and in that event, devotion may not be permitted at all.
('86', 426, 3, 9, 592915) I can only hope that the fear is wholly unjustified.
('86', 426, 3, 10, 592968) In my letter of 6th May, 1944, to the Government I reduced my contention to writing to the effect that
('86', 426, 4, 11, 593071) by reason of the cremation of the corpses of Shri Mahadev Desai and then my wife, the place of cremation which has been fenced off becomes consecrated ground.
('86', 426, 4, 12, 593230) The party has daily visited the ground twice and offered floral tributes to the departed spirits and said prayers.
('86', 426, 4, 13, 593345) I trust that the plot will be acquired by the Government with the right of way to it through H. H. the Aga Khan’s grounds so as to enable those relatives and friends who wish to visit the cremation ground whenever they like.
('86', 426, 4, 14, 593570) To this the following reply was received:
('86', 426, 5, 15, 593612) I am to inform you that it is legally impossible for Government to acquire the site compulsorily under the Land Acquisition Act.
('86', 426, 5, 16, 593741) Government considers that the matter is one for private negotiations between you and His Highness the Aga Khan.
('86', 426, 5, 17, 593853) I am to add, however, that your request has been communicated to His Highness the Aga Khan and is now understood to be under his consideration.
('86', 426, 5, 18, 593997) Government understands that he has no objection, in the mean while, to the relatives of Mrs. Gandhi and Mr. Mahadev Desai and any other persons suggested by you going through the Palace

('86', 427, 1, 3, 594398) I do hope that, no matter who occupies or owns the palace, the consecrated ground on which the two samadhis stand will be protected and reserved for devotion by the friends and relatives of the families.

('86', 427, 6, 8, 594700) DEAR SISTER, I have your letter.
('86', 427, 6, 9, 594733) It is a very good practice to give money for Harijan work or some such cause on occasions such as a birth or an engagement or a dear one’s death.
('86', 427, 6, 10, 594879) I have received your cheque.
('86', 427, 6, 11, 594908) I will go to Poona at the end of June or around that time.
('86', 427, 6, 12, 594967) If you come then you will be able to keep your vow.
('86', 427, 6, 13, 595019) If possible we shall go to the samadhi together.

('86', 427, 12, 19, 595246) PRA BHA, You were released and the restrictions on Rajkumari were lifted.
('86', 427, 12, 20, 595320) I got news of both together.
('86', 427, 12, 21, 595349) But that did not make me happy.
('86', 427, 12, 22, 595381) The reason is exactly what you write.
('86', 427, 12, 23, 595419) I received your wire yesterday and the letter today.
('86', 427, 12, 24, 595472) How can you be blamed if you wrote in pencil because there was no other help?
('86', 427, 12, 25, 595550) Even so your handwriting is very good and well formed.
('86', 427, 12, 26, 595605) It was your duty to go to Father.
('86', 427, 12, 27, 595639) It was good you went there.
('86', 427, 12, 28, 595667) Come here after you are able to leave the place.

('86', 428, 1, 4, 595882) You will stay here only as long as it is necessary.

('86', 428, 1, 6, 595948) I will reach Panchgani on the 31st.
('86', 428, 1, 7, 595984) Mahabaleshwar is only a little higher up.
('86', 428, 1, 8, 596026) Why do you feel shy of spectacles?
('86', 428, 1, 9, 596061) Khurshedbehn is at Panchgani.
('86', 428, 1, 10, 596091) More when we meet.

('86', 429, 2, 3, 596966) May 28, 1945
('86', 429, 3, 4, 596979) MY DEAR BHARATAN, Your letter and the book.
('86', 429, 3, 5, 597023) 1 Appasamy came, left the book and went away.
('86', 429, 3, 6, 597069) I have not met him.
('86', 429, 3, 7, 597089) I wonder if he will seek me out and meet me though I am silent the whole day till evening prayer!
('86', 429, 3, 8, 597187) You need not apologize for sending me the book.
('86', 429, 3, 9, 597235) I must read it.
('86', 429, 3, 10, 597251) I glanced at it, as it came into my hands.
('86', 429, 3, 11, 597294) How does it differ from your description of socialism which you say centres round society and its needs and villagism which you say centres round the village and its wants?
('86', 429, 3, 12, 597467) Do you mark any difference?
('86', 429, 3, 13, 597495) Is not village and its welfare the same as society and its needs?
('86', 429, 3, 14, 597561) Is not the difference this: socialism includes violence as a measure to achieve it, villagism excludes it?
('86', 429, 3, 15, 597668) My English is not perfect.
('86', 429, 3, 16, 597695) It may be relatively better than Hindustani.
('86', 429, 3, 17, 597740) I must try to make it equal to my English, if it is not.
('86', 429, 3, 18, 597797) I reach the masses only through Hindustani however imperfect it may be, never through English, however perfect it may be.
('86', 429, 3, 19, 597919) If you admit this, the Patrika would be only in Hindustani and the provinces will render it in the provincial languages, the people thereof will understand.
('86', 429, 3, 20, 598076) You may have an English translation of necessary extracts for the foreign reader.
('86', 429, 3, 21, 598158) This can happen only when both of you see the point and resolve to write in Hindustani however imperfect it may be.
('86', 429, 3, 22, 598274) I migrate to Panchgani on 31st May.

('86', 430, 3, 5, 598552) Both Pyarelal and Narahari had been to the place.
('86', 430, 3, 6, 598602) They do not think much of it.
('86', 430, 3, 7, 598632) The work done is make believe.
('86', 430, 3, 8, 598663) It is a poor house giving charity.
('86', 430, 3, 9, 598698) And from what I understand Mahabaleshwar owing to its heavy rainfall is not the place to hold such an institution.
('86', 430, 3, 10, 598813) Able bodied poor may live in the place and even thrive.

('86', 433, 6, 19, 602786) Even you yourself cannot go against it.
('86', 433, 6, 20, 602826) No woman can at one and the same time both bear children and be of service.
('86', 433, 6, 21, 602902) Of course bearing children can also become a kind of service.

('86', 433, 6, 23, 603026) Hear what everyone says and then obey the dictates of your heart.
('86', 433, 6, 24, 603092) It will be all right if you reach Sevagram on the 9th June.
('86', 433, 6, 25, 603152) Sushilabehn will write more.
('86', 433, 6, 26, 603181) You are not a small girl at all.

('86', 436, 9, 15, 605967) One can say that true adult education is being imparted if the wells are kept in good order, houses are fitted with windows and there is light in the rooms.
('86', 436, 9, 16, 606124) The new economics you have indicated is quite good.
('86', 436, 9, 17, 606176) If we succeed in labour banks, then the success of grain banks, etc., is within our reach.
('86', 436, 9, 18, 606267) You must maintain your health.
('86', 436, 9, 19, 606298) You will be able to do that if you do your work with detachment.

('86', 438, 3, 10, 607826) He can only argue thus.

('86', 438, 3, 13, 607923) Shriman has taken his argument to the extreme.
('86', 438, 3, 14, 607970) It is impossible today.
('86', 438, 3, 15, 607994) Ramdas does not know the whole of India directly or indirectly.
('86', 438, 3, 16, 608058) It is not his fault.
('86', 438, 3, 17, 608079) One must be acquainted with the situation in India in order to make a scientific study.
('86', 438, 3, 18, 608167) The situation about which he is talking is due to the invasion from the West.
('86', 438, 3, 19, 608245) There can only be violence at the root of Ramdas’s statement.
('86', 438, 3, 20, 608307) If non violence has to prevail, many things will have to be carried on without steam power, etc.
('86', 438, 3, 21, 608404) That there should be big factories run by the people for big industries is a matter of regret, not of joy.
('86', 438, 3, 22, 608511) In brief, Ramdas will have to think very deeply.
('86', 438, 3, 23, 608560) I know that ultimately Ramdas will be able to give up his attachment.
('86', 438, 3, 24, 608630) You have got to go to Nagpur.
('86', 438, 3, 25, 608660) Go there and get lots of experience.

('86', 439, 4, 6, 609015) I am not at all satisfied about Ratan Devi.
('86', 439, 4, 7, 609059) She has only been exploited.
('86', 439, 4, 8, 609088) You yourself should have given the reply.
('86', 439, 4, 9, 609130) Ratan Devi must surely be regretting that she does not know English.
('86', 439, 4, 10, 609199) What does it matter if the editor brings out an English paper ?
('86', 439, 5, 11, 609263) Do not involve me in the politics there.

('86', 440, 3, 4, 609584) PYARELAL’S STATEMENT1
('86', 440, 4, 5, 609606) Gandhiji, having seen it, says that he never sent any such or other circular to Congress workers or committees in any or all the Provinces.
('86', 440, 4, 6, 609746) The statement that has appeared in the Press to that effect is, therefore, wrong.
('86', 440, 4, 7, 609828) He holds the view, and has shared it with correspondents, that as long as the Congress President and his colleagues are in prison, Congressmen must act on their own initiative and judgment and no individual or group or assembly, whatever name they give to themselves, will have the authority to act in the name or on behalf of the Congress organization.
('86', 440, 4, 8, 610182) They are entitled to and bound to act as they deem it best in the interests of the cause for which the Congress stands, but they do so on their own authority and responsibility and cannot use the name of the Congress to enforce their decision.
('86', 440, 4, 9, 610426) Gandhiji adds that such is his individual opinion.
