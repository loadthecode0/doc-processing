('59', 0, 2, 3, 72) January 13, 1933
('59', 0, 3, 4, 89) MY DEAR PURANDARE, I have your letter.
('59', 0, 3, 5, 128) I am sorry to have had it.
('59', 0, 3, 6, 155) I don’t like the spirit underlying it.
('59', 0, 3, 7, 194) You have looked upon the whole thing as a commercial transaction, whereas I have looked upon the whole thing as a matter of selfless service.
('59', 0, 3, 8, 336) You left the question of remuneration entirely in my hands, although I asked you to tell me what you would charge for giving me a corrected collection of your speeches on untouchability and for supervising the printing.
('59', 0, 3, 9, 556) But you would not think of it, telling me that there was no mercenary motive behind it.
('59', 0, 3, 10, 644) That being so, I had no hesitation in undertaking the delicate task, but at the end of it, I shirked it, and I asked Haribhau to name the sum.
('59', 0, 3, 11, 787) He named Rs. 125 and I straightaway accepted.
('59', 0, 3, 12, 833) Believe me, so far as I am concerned, I did not think of the Arya Bhushan bill in connection with fixing up your fee, remuneration or honorarium, whatever it may be called.
('59', 0, 3, 13, 1006) Nor did I then know nor do I now know that the Arya Bhushan bill is exorbitant.
('59', 0, 3, 14, 1086) My understanding is that they should not make anything but nominal profits.
('59', 0, 3, 15, 1162) You are thinking of anything between Rs. 500 to 3,000. I can only meet your proposal with a reasonable offer.
('59', 0, 3, 16, 1272) You can take over the book yourself by simply paying the printing charges and sell the book on your own account and make whatever profit you can, only you should not increase the published price, for any increase in the price would be unjust to the public.
('59', 0, 3, 17, 1529) I have already asked Haribhau to pay you Rs. 125 if you would accept the amount in full payment and not feel any dissatisfaction.
('59', 0, 3, 18, 1659) For I would be deeply hurt if, after having left the thing in my hands, you were dissatisfied with the amount declared by me.
('59', 0, 4, 19, 1785) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('59', 1, 3, 4, 1968) DEAR FRIEND, I will not refer you to any of my statements this time, but I will ask you to re read your own letter 1. I suggest to you that that letter is libellous, insulting and unworthy of one who holds the position of General Secretary of a Sanatan Dharma Sabha.
('59', 1, 3, 5, 2235) If you will re read your letter calmly and dispassionately, you will at once apologize to the pandits whom you have libelled, and, in any event, till you apologize, your letters will neither be read nor replied to.
('59', 1, 3, 6, 2450) I am sorry for it.

('59', 1, 7, 11, 2644) January 13, 1933
('59', 1, 8, 12, 2661) DEAR SATYANANDA BABOO, You are always so good and always think of me whenever there is anything to say to me.
('59', 1, 8, 13, 2771) I think that this is hardly the time to consider improvements in Dr. Subbaroyan’s Bill.
('59', 1, 8, 14, 2859) The first thing is to get the Viceregal sanction.
('59', 1, 8, 15, 2909) When that is had, many improvements may be possible.
('59', 1, 8, 16, 2962) I am not therefore just now applying my mind to your suggestion 2. After the principle of the Bill is once accepted, the Government themselves may

('59', 2, 1, 3, 3635) So far as I am concerned, my one thought in connection with the temple entry is the purification of caste Hindus.
('59', 2, 1, 4, 3749) But of course I shall bear your suggestions in mind whenever the occasion arises for their use.

('59', 2, 5, 10, 3995) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter together with your article 1. I am sorry indeed that there should have been any molestation of you by the audience.
('59', 2, 5, 11, 4143) I have, as you must be aware, repeatedly written against intolerance, and I shall gladly re emphasize my warning when the time comes.
('59', 2, 5, 12, 4277) As for your article, we must agree to differ.

('59', 3, 6, 12, 5767) 6. LETTER TO C. RAJAGOPALACHARI
('59', 3, 7, 13, 5799) January 13, 1933
('59', 3, 8, 14, 5816) MY DEAR C.R., Vallabhbhai had a battle royal with me last night on your behalf.
('59', 3, 8, 15, 5896) If a person, an utter stranger to him, had chance to be there, from the vehemence of Vallabhbhai’s language, he would have concluded that we must be most quarrelsome persons.
('59', 3, 8, 16, 6071) He thought that I was doing violent injustice to you, inasmuch as, without consultation with you, I made proposals that might prove to be utterly embarrassing, as had happened on two occasions.
('59', 3, 8, 17, 6265) The cause of our quarrel was my compromise proposal 1. He thought that I had no right to publish it without consultation with you, and he was quite sure that though you were too good to mention it to me, you had felt very much embarrassed by it, if not also irritated.
('59', 3, 8, 18, 6534) I told him that you were too good to conceal your embarrassment from me, if you were really embarrassed, and that would be quite unlike you.
('59', 3, 8, 19, 6675) I even added that in this particular instance you happened even to like my proposal and that even if it was discovered that you did not
('59', 3, 9, 20, 6811) 1 For a discussion, vide “Talk with Sadashivrao and Shinde”, 13 1 1933
('59', 4, 0, 1, 6882) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 5
('59', 4, 1, 2, 6925) like it and that you were really embarrassed, it was impossible for me every time to consult you, or such other colleagues on such occasions.
('59', 4, 1, 3, 7067) I went further and argued that work on such lines would become almost impossible.
('59', 4, 1, 4, 7149) People act together when there is a general agreement between them on fundamentals and [provided] that their deductions from those fundamentals were, as a rule, identical, and that if, at times, they came to different deductions, a timely confession of error would keep their friendship in tact, as also the common cause.
('59', 4, 1, 5, 7471) Nothing that I could say, however, would conciliate Vallabhbhai.
('59', 4, 1, 6, 7536) The curfew bell, mutually agreed upon by us, came to the rescue, and put an end to what promised to be an endless discussion.
('59', 4, 1, 7, 7662) But I retired to bed with a determination that I would refer the matter to you.
('59', 4, 1, 8, 7742) Your reply, one way or the other, would bring some consolation to your counsel, and you know that it won’t make me disconsolate if you agreed with your counsel on both his propositions, namely, that before giving to the world the compromise proposal which I had given to Pandit Panchanan Tarkaratna I should have consulted you, and that it, as a matter of fact, did embarrass you.
('59', 4, 1, 9, 8123) You would also add to your opinion on these points, your opinion whether on merits you consider my proposal to be sound or otherwise.
('59', 4, 1, 10, 8257) A perfect tragedy was enacted here yesterday.
('59', 4, 1, 11, 8303) Five pandits and their five advisers came to the jail gate yesterday an hour and a half after the appointed time and took two hours and a half in exchanging brief notes with me, the three notes 1 that they exchanged with me taking all the two hours and a half.
('59', 4, 1, 12, 8564) And, will you believe it, when I tell you that they would not come in and carry on the discussion because I would not remove one word I had added to their draft, the word being an adjective added to the word ‘untouchables’.
('59', 4, 1, 13, 8788) The adjective applied was ‘as at present classified’.
('59', 4, 1, 14, 8842) Of course it altered the whole scope of their discussion.
('59', 4, 1, 15, 8900) So they went away.
('59', 4, 1, 16, 8919) Of course it is not our position that there is no untouchability at all in the Shastras.
('59', 4, 1, 17, 9008) Our position is that there is no untouchability in the Shastras as we practise it today.
('59', 4, 1, 18, 9097) They were expected to prove that untouchability as at present practised has sanction in the Shastras.
('59', 4, 1, 19, 9199) It is an impossible task to perform honestly.
('59', 4, 1, 20, 9245) No text that has yet been cited on their behalf has proved it.
('59', 4, 1, 21, 9308) The Shastris on our behalf are really very learned men, and also pious men.
('59', 4, 1, 22, 9384) It is their honest conviction that there is no warrant for the untouchability of the present day in the Shastras.
('59', 4, 1, 23, 9498) The real

('59', 5, 5, 7, 9777) January 13, 1933
('59', 5, 6, 8, 9794) MY DEAR JOSEPH, You can better imagine than I can describe my joy at receiving your letter, and especially your letter 1 to Pyarelal.
('59', 5, 6, 9, 9928) I shall try to have your letter delivered to him.
('59', 5, 6, 10, 9978) But let me say two things in connection with that letter.
('59', 5, 6, 11, 10036) My fast 2 was not a fast unto death in its literal sense.
('59', 5, 6, 12, 10094) The Roman Catholic priest, who is a visitor to this prison, knows me, and when I was on the eve of taking that fast, he came over to me in his kindly manner just to say one word, and he said how he drew the distinction between a suicide and a sacrifice.
('59', 5, 6, 13, 10348) A suicide carried with it a certainty of destruction.
('59', 5, 6, 14, 10402) A sacrifice meant risking life, the greater the risk, the greater the sacrifice.
('59', 5, 6, 15, 10483) But there should be nothing beyond risk.
('59', 5, 6, 16, 10524) I had no hesitation in agreeing with the distinction, and my fast being conditional was not a fast amounting to suicide, but it was a fast involving the greatest risk, but still a risk and no more.
('59', 5, 6, 17, 10722) You will be interested to know that some of my Roman Catholic friends have detected no flaw in the fast.
('59', 5, 6, 18, 10827) Of course, in Hinduism some few extreme cases there are in which ending of life is peremptory, but these I need not consider at present.
('59', 5, 6, 19, 10964) There is general agreement between Hinduism and other faiths that suicide is a sin.
('59', 5, 6, 20, 11048) Now, about the Inner Voice.
('59', 5, 6, 21, 11076) 3 Here again I can agree with you whole heartedly when you say that the voice of God can never counsel or ountenance sin.
('59', 5, 6, 22, 11198) Encouragement to sin can only come from the devil.
('59', 5, 6, 23, 11249) But the real difficulty comes in when the question of
('59', 5, 7, 24, 11303) 1 In which the addressee had expressed his views on Pyarelal's book The Epic Fast and stated: “The Inner Voice is either a hallucination or the voice of God.
('59', 5, 7, 25, 11461) If it is truly the voice of God, it cannot counsel self destruction because the life that God gives is for Him alone to put an end to .
('59', 5, 7, 26, 11597) .” 2 Vide
('59', 5, 8, 27, 11607) 3 For a discussion, vide “Discussion with a Friend”, 13 1 1933
('59', 6, 0, 1, 11670) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 7
('59', 6, 1, 2, 11713) sin itself is debatable.
('59', 6, 1, 3, 11738) Those who would consider a particular act to be sinful will naturally reject the claim that it was prompted by God.
('59', 6, 1, 4, 11854) Hence it was that in answer to a question I said 1 that whilst in self defence and for the sake of truth which I worship I was bound to say what I believed, my claim was not to be accepted as part of argument in determining relevant questions.
('59', 6, 1, 5, 12098) The opponents were bound to rule [out] that claim as wholly beside the point.
('59', 6, 1, 6, 12176) Whether the claim for the voice of God was well or ill made in a particular case can only be decided after the claimant’s death, and in some extraordinary cases it may even then be difficult.
('59', 6, 1, 7, 12368) Apart from the danger of hypocrisy there is the still greater danger of self deception to which mankind is prone, and it is possible for self deceived people to attain great things and yet their claim that the voice of God was behind their acts might be wholly wrong.
('59', 6, 1, 8, 12636) These are final difficulties which will remain to the end of time, but if the truth is to make any progress, then self deluded people must also be allowed full play.
('59', 6, 2, 9, 12802) Finally comes the question of confession.
('59', 6, 2, 10, 12844) You may not know that I have some very valued Roman Catholic friends also.
('59', 6, 2, 11, 12919) I am in the habit of picking up knowledge more from personal contact than from printed texts.
('59', 6, 2, 12, 13013) These friends have not yet been able to clearly define the function of Confession and the Confessor.
('59', 6, 2, 13, 13114) For instance, what is one to confess who has no consciousness of guilt and when there is, I can understand a Confessor granting absolution, but can he also guide the future acts of the penitent?
('59', 6, 2, 14, 13309) In the place of the Confessor Hinduism has the Guru.
('59', 6, 2, 15, 13362) I have all my life striven to find one, one to whom I can shift all my burdens and roam about merely doing his will.
('59', 6, 2, 16, 13479) But then such implicit limitless obedience is not a mechanical act; and having got the spirit of obedience instinctively within me I would be satisfied by nothing less than tendering complete obedience.
('59', 6, 2, 17, 13682) But it seems to me that it is not given to all to find the true Guru in this short span of life.
('59', 6, 2, 18, 13779) But it is given to all to make that diligent search, and it may be that that very search is its own reward, and that it keeps one in possession of peace and joy everlasting.
('59', 6, 2, 19, 13953) Anyway, you will accept my testimony that ceaseless search has not only given me such joy and peace, but has protected me from conscious error.
('59', 6, 2, 20, 14097) I thank you for copying for me that extract from Imitation of

('59', 7, 6, 10, 14582) Vinabehn also told me about your illness.
('59', 7, 6, 11, 14624) Illness does not spare even a lawyer, nor the chairman of a municipality!
('59', 7, 6, 12, 14698) It is something to be thankful for that you will be able to move about soon.
('59', 7, 6, 13, 14775) I read Keshavji’s questions.
('59', 7, 6, 14, 14804) We should willingly endure a great many things like this to atone for the sins of our ancestors and our contemporaries.
('59', 7, 6, 15, 14924) When to suspicion is added selfishness, you can expect nothing better.
('59', 7, 6, 16, 14995) But I suppose the skin of your back has become sufficiently thick by now so that you feel such blows as light as flowers.

('59', 7, 6, 18, 15193) Since when did you become Dada?
('59', 7, 6, 19, 15225) It must have been before I was born.
('59', 7, 6, 20, 15262) May you live long and serve the Harijans.
('59', 7, 6, 21, 15304) Bapa suggests that you should use your influence with Vaishnavas like Chimanbhai, Sakarbhai, etc.
('59', 7, 6, 22, 15402) They may not permit Harijans to enter temples for darshan, but they should liberally help with money for activities other than the movement for temple entry.
('59', 7, 6, 23, 15560) But need one commend the cause of the tongue to the teeth?
('59', 7, 6, 24, 15619) If Bapa’s word does not carry weight with Dada, how can Bapu of merely fifteen years, standing hope that his will?
('59', 7, 6, 25, 15734) I have only passed on to you the load put on my head by Bapa.
('59', 7, 6, 26, 15796) He has also ordered me to write to Kasturbhai 3
('59', 7, 7, 27, 15844) and make a similar request to him.

('59', 8, 6, 10, 16508) I had a wire from Lilavati 2 too.
('59', 8, 6, 11, 16542) She has replied that she cannot say anything without consulting Padma.
('59', 8, 6, 12, 16613) Let me have all the information you possess regarding this marriage.
('59', 8, 6, 13, 16682) Who is the bridegroom and what kind of a man is he?
('59', 8, 6, 14, 16734) What is his age?
('59', 8, 6, 15, 16751) What is his economic condition and what sort of health does he have?
('59', 8, 6, 16, 16820) What is his occupation?
('59', 8, 6, 17, 16844) I suppose you know that Maganlal 3 is against the marriage.
('59', 8, 6, 18, 16904) You seem to be very busy with the marriage in your family.
('59', 8, 6, 19, 16963) I hope you have not been incurring unnecessary expenditure.
('59', 8, 6, 20, 17023) Utilize the occasion also to give as much money to worthy causes as you can.

('59', 8, 12, 26, 17272) She should be sent away to a place like Deolali.
('59', 8, 12, 27, 17321) She will be restored to health only if she takes complete rest there.

('59', 9, 6, 10, 17975) Show them to Bhai Mavalankar.
('59', 9, 6, 11, 18005) If his health has improved go with him to both of them.
('59', 9, 6, 12, 18061) Or, you yourself do what you can.
('59', 9, 6, 13, 18095) If we fail today, we shall succeed tomorrow.
('59', 9, 6, 14, 18140) Let us not give up hope.
('59', 9, 6, 15, 18165) My booklet for the Gujaratis will certainly materialize.
('59', 9, 6, 16, 18222) It is taking time but now it will soon be ready, provided nothing fresh crops up to impede it.

('59', 9, 12, 22, 18491) DEAR CHAMANBHAI, Bhai Shankerlal and Thakkar Bapa write that apart from the temple entry, you are also declining to help to other activities of Harijan service.
('59', 9, 12, 23, 18652) I did not, and still do not, expect this of you.
('59', 9, 12, 24, 18701) Others may find fault with me as a Vaishnava, but surely you would not join them.

('59', 10, 1, 3, 19027) However, I will let that pass for now.

('59', 10, 1, 6, 19166) Bhai Mangaldas gave me this right and you acknowledge it.

('59', 10, 7, 13, 19402) MY DEAR MARGARETE, I must continue to dictate.
('59', 10, 7, 14, 19449) You are entitled to call yourself an Indian since you have felt like one from your childhood, but that is not a substitute for your German birth.
('59', 10, 7, 15, 19595) The adoption should be an addition both to your name and to your strength, and what can be finer than that we should all add on the virtues of our own nations to those of the others!
('59', 10, 7, 16, 19778) Why was there a struggle to choose between Gurudev and myself?
('59', 10, 7, 17, 19841) We are no competitors.
('59', 10, 7, 18, 19864) Gurudev occupies a throne which belongs to him by sheer merit.
('59', 10, 7, 19, 19927) I have none of the gifts that he has, and what is more, we dearly love each other, and as years roll on, our love becomes stronger, and we understand also each other better and better.
('59', 10, 7, 20, 20112) I would have you therefore to say that you like us both equally for whatever gifts God has bestowed upon us.
('59', 10, 7, 21, 20221) No more therefore of choice making, if you would be a real daughter like Mira.
('59', 10, 7, 22, 20300) I hope you got my previous letter 2in which I acknowledged your letter written from Aden.
('59', 10, 7, 23, 20390) The registered packet addressed to Mahadev was also duly received.
('59', 10, 7, 24, 20457) Love from us both.

('59', 11, 2, 3, 20704) January 14, 1933
('59', 11, 3, 4, 20721) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('59', 11, 3, 5, 20754) The question is not so much what the Harijans need, but how the caste Hindus should behave towards them.
('59', 11, 3, 6, 20859) In my opinion, it is the clear duty of caste Hindus to give to the Harijans the same rights that they enjoy.
('59', 11, 3, 7, 20968) The fact that evil has survived numberless generations does not make it any the less an evil.
('59', 11, 3, 8, 21062) Similarly, the fact that untouchability has survived the great religious teachers whom you name does not warrant the present generation in continuing it, if it can be proved to be an evil.
('59', 11, 3, 9, 21251) I am convinced it is.
('59', 11, 3, 10, 21273) A person who has heard the inner call should still be open to reason and therefore conviction.
('59', 11, 3, 11, 21368) That attitude enables him and others to test the truth of his claim.
('59', 11, 3, 12, 21437) I do say with my conception of Hinduism that God denies Himself what Harijans are denied, because they are called Harijans.
('59', 11, 4, 13, 21561) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('59', 11, 8, 18, 21698) DEAR BABOO BHAGWANDAS, I have your letter.
('59', 11, 8, 19, 21741) I read an account of your meeting 1 in the papers.
('59', 11, 8, 20, 21792) We are bound at the present moment to find obstruction at our meetings.
('59', 11, 8, 21, 21864) I know that the Benares meeting was in the safest hands and I knew how you took the wind out of the sail of the adversary by always giving him the chance and even the first chance of speaking and restraining the sympathizers from retaliating.
('59', 11, 8, 22, 22107) I do hope that you soon got out of the effect of the little fever.
('59', 11, 8, 23, 22174) It does not do to take unnecessary risks at our age.
('59', 11, 8, 24, 22227) I suppose you are a few years older.

('59', 12, 1, 3, 22582) I am getting cuttings from Marathi and Gujarati but not from Hindi.
('59', 12, 1, 4, 22650) I have not forgotten the message for the Aaj, nor the book you kindly left for me, the very first copy.
('59', 12, 1, 5, 22754) I acknowledged it in a previous letter which I hope you duly received.
('59', 12, 1, 6, 22825) You will be pleased to know that I have already made the commencement, but I have to confess that I am going very slow and sometimes misreading it altogether.

('59', 12, 6, 12, 23125) I want to warn you against resisting nature beyond the saturation point.
('59', 12, 6, 13, 23198) In Biblical language, I should say: “Thou shalt not tempt the Lord, thy God.” I would say without the slightest hesitation, if you have another bad attack you should treat it as the clearest call from God to return to England and render what service you can render there.
('59', 12, 6, 14, 23470) If God wants you here, the first thing He would give you is health of body.
('59', 12, 6, 15, 23546) If you have humbly to acknowledge defeat, you should do so.
('59', 12, 6, 16, 23606) Your defeat will be victory for God of truth.
('59', 12, 6, 17, 23652) There is no waste in God’s laboratory.
('59', 12, 6, 18, 23691) The work begun there by you will not die.
('59', 12, 6, 19, 23733) I do not mind if one man who has good health and is beyond reproach in character is there in sole charge.
('59', 12, 6, 20, 23839) If there is no such worker just now, let the whole thing be temporarily wound up.
('59', 12, 6, 21, 23921) This is no doleful picture.
('59', 12, 6, 22, 23949) It is the real background for a Godly life.
('59', 12, 6, 23, 23993) “Not my will, but thine, of Truth.” I must not prolong this sermon.
('59', 12, 6, 24, 24061) You know what I mean.

('59', 13, 4, 6, 24337) I don’t require any information about Liladhar from you.
('59', 13, 4, 7, 24394) Do you know if Shankarbhai neglects his father?
('59', 13, 4, 8, 24442) I have already written to Mahavir again.
('59', 13, 4, 9, 24483) Vallabhbhai suggests Wadhwan for Radha.
('59', 13, 4, 10, 24523) I asked you to write to me about the Chharas 1. Their harassment of us seems to have stopped.
('59', 13, 4, 11, 24617) Does a bhajan party 2 visit their settlement?
('59', 13, 4, 12, 24663) Has the Government posted police to keep watch on hem?
('59', 13, 5, 13, 24718) Prema causes me some worry.
('59', 13, 5, 14, 24746) Her conduct frightens me.
('59', 13, 5, 15, 24772) If she is silent because she has realized her error, I need not mind.
('59', 13, 5, 16, 24842) If, however, she is silent because she is angry, she has more serious defect of character than I had thought.
('59', 13, 5, 17, 24952) Try and discover, if you can, what is in her heart.

('59', 14, 4, 11, 25748) KASHI, I have gone through your letter.
('59', 14, 4, 12, 25788) I felt very unhappy that we could not talk a little longer.
('59', 14, 4, 13, 25848) If, however, we go a little deeper into the matter, we might wonder what after all there was to talk about.
('59', 14, 4, 14, 25956) Since you will be reading my letter to Prabhudas, I will not say anything more about the matter.
('59', 14, 4, 15, 26053) I will write directly to you and you also should send your letters directly to me.
('59', 14, 4, 16, 26136) I had written to Keshu just a few days before.
('59', 14, 4, 17, 26183) There is much difference between Keshu’s nature and that of Prabhudas’s.
('59', 14, 4, 18, 26256) Prabhudas will open his mind to everyone, Keshu will not do so to anyone.
('59', 14, 4, 19, 26330) With Maganlal, too, he hardly ever talked.
('59', 14, 4, 20, 26373) However, it is certainly your duty to tell me if you know anything or have seen anything about him.

('59', 14, 6, 23, 26564) YERAVDA, January 14, 1933
('59', 14, 7, 24, 26590) PRABHUDAS, l received your letter.
('59', 14, 7, 25, 26625) It seems to me improper that you should have written directly to Nanabhai.
('59', 14, 7, 26, 26700) Kakasaheb may write if he wishes to.
('59', 14, 7, 27, 26737) And it would be unreasonable for me to burden him with responsibility.
('59', 14, 7, 28, 26808) We may keep in mind the conditions you have
('59', 15, 0, 1, 26852) 16 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 15, 1, 2, 26893) stipulated but we cannot put them down on paper.
('59', 15, 1, 3, 26942) It would be altogether unbecoming to do so.
('59', 15, 1, 4, 26986) Discuss with Kakasaheb all that you have written to me and do as he suggests.
('59', 15, 1, 5, 27064) I can understand your impatience.
('59', 15, 1, 6, 27098) Once you have decided to marry, it is best that you should do so as soon as possible.
('59', 15, 1, 7, 27184) However, some time is bound to elapse.
('59', 15, 1, 8, 27223) Or, perhaps it may not be so.
('59', 15, 1, 9, 27253) Certainly the best course is that you yourself should look for a girl concurrently with the work you are doing and Kakasaheb and others also may be on the lookout at the same time.
('59', 15, 1, 10, 27434) Do not worry about what Vinoba will think.
('59', 15, 1, 11, 27477) His blessings will always be with you.
('59', 15, 1, 12, 27516) You cannot have a girl from the Ashram, for it would be improper to arouse the least traceof such a feeling in any girl in the Ashram.
('59', 15, 1, 13, 27651) Even indirectly, such a feeling should not be encouraged.
('59', 15, 1, 14, 27709) Hence you should also not think of selecting any of the girls who have newly joined the Ashram.
('59', 15, 1, 15, 27805) What you say about Padma in your letter shows how dangerous was the close association of you two.
('59', 15, 1, 16, 27903) Both of you were forcing yourselves to behave as brother and sister, while deep down in your hearts you felt yourselves to be husband and wife.
('59', 15, 1, 17, 28047) But that is an old story now.
('59', 15, 1, 18, 28077) Padma will of course know the fact when you get married, but it is too much to expect her to find a girl for you.
('59', 15, 1, 19, 28191) It is beyond her capacity, but even if it was within her capacity, it would be undesirable to do so.
('59', 15, 1, 20, 28292) We just cannot burden her with such a responsibility.
('59', 15, 1, 21, 28346) You have no reason whatever to feel helpless.
('59', 15, 1, 22, 28392) Write to me without hesitation any foolish or silly idea that may occur to you.
('59', 15, 1, 23, 28472) I will not misunderstand what you say, for, I have faith in you and even blind love for you.
('59', 15, 1, 24, 28565) I believe that you will never deceive me.
('59', 15, 1, 25, 28607) I am not in the least unhappy at your simplicity of mind.
('59', 15, 1, 26, 28665) If your simplicity is a cause of fear for you, it also acts as a shield for me.
('59', 15, 1, 27, 28745) You yourself may tell G.V. Pant, Harivallabh or any other of your acquaintances in Almora to guide and help you.
('59', 15, 1, 28, 28858) Do not think of the high or low social status of the girl concerned, consider only her character.
('59', 15, 1, 29, 28956) Write to Devdas.
('59', 15, 1, 30, 28973) He may possibly have some girl in view.
('59', 15, 1, 31, 29013) It would be good if you spend about a month in Kosamba and learn the harmless method of extracting honey.
('59', 15, 1, 32, 29119) The whole course takes a month and a half to complete.
('59', 15, 1, 33, 29174) But really speaking, it should not require even that much time.
('59', 15, 1, 34, 29238) I am firmly of the view that for industrious people like us, a week or fifteen days at the most are sufficient.
('59', 15, 1, 35, 29350) There is no need at all for you to go out of your way to see

('59', 16, 1, 2, 29455) Sarojinidevi, nor to satisfy her with an explanation.
('59', 16, 1, 3, 29509) If she has indulged in an exaggeration, it cannot be undone now.
('59', 16, 1, 4, 29574) Our own way of looking at things should be such that if we ourselves have committed a little wrong, it should appear to us big as mountain, so that if the world regards it as such, we are not shocked.
('59', 16, 1, 5, 29775) The man who looks upon his failings as if they were diamonds and pearls and weighs their value as we do that of diamonds and pearls, is certain to commit big sins and he who looks upon the smallest sin as if it was the biggest, would certainly be saved from big sins.
('59', 16, 1, 6, 30043) I would see nothing wrong if you happen to meet Sarojinidevi by chance and the matter comes up for discussion but there is no need at all to open the subject intentionally.

('59', 16, 6, 10, 30301) January 15, 1933
('59', 16, 7, 11, 30318) NARANDAS, All your letters seem to have been delivered to me.
('59', 16, 7, 12, 30380) For how many days did Chimanlal 1 try the fenugreek seeds?
('59', 16, 7, 13, 30439) Jamna 2 may try them along with any other medicine which she is taking.
('59', 16, 7, 14, 30511) But she should take care that she does not get constipation.
('59', 16, 7, 15, 30572) About Mahavir, I can think of no other way.
('59', 16, 7, 16, 30616) The whole family must leave.
('59', 16, 7, 17, 30645) I have given up the hope of their observing the rules.
('59', 16, 7, 18, 30700) This is my view.
('59', 16, 7, 19, 30717) If, however, you wish to let them stay, I can have no objection.
('59', 16, 7, 20, 30782) But have no doubt that misplaced kindness is a form of violence.
('59', 16, 7, 21, 30847) I also feel worried about Prema.
('59', 16, 7, 22, 30880) I am pained and surprised that she cannot see her weakness which everybody else can see.
('59', 16, 7, 23, 30969) I had hoped that I would be able to open her eyes.
('59', 16, 7, 24, 31020) It seems I have been wrong, for the present at any rate.
('59', 16, 7, 25, 31077) But she is a thoughtful lady.
('59', 16, 7, 26, 31107) Hence I do not give up hope altogether.
('59', 16, 7, 27, 31147) Her language was certainly full of hatred, but she denies it.
('59', 16, 7, 28, 31209) That means that she does not know when one’s language may be described as full of hatred.
('59', 16, 7, 29, 31299) She does not

('59', 17, 1, 2, 31462) even have faith in me to trust that, when my loving heart feels the presence of hatred anywhere, it must be there.
('59', 17, 1, 3, 31577) I am partial to her and stress her virtues as outweighing her faults.
('59', 17, 1, 4, 31647) If, then, I see a weakness in her, instead of getting angry with me she should be humble and try to understand her weakness.
('59', 17, 1, 5, 31772) If I am committing an error, she should point it out to me.
('59', 17, 1, 6, 31832) This is how I feel.
('59', 17, 1, 7, 31852) I may die any day.
('59', 17, 1, 8, 31871) Ultimately the burden will have to be shouldered by you.
('59', 17, 1, 9, 31928) Therefore do what you think best.
('59', 17, 1, 10, 31962) If I am doing injustice to anybody in any matter, do not hesitate to tell me so.
('59', 17, 1, 11, 32043) And if you are convinced that my view is correct, do not hesitate to tell her so emphatically.
('59', 17, 1, 12, 32138) I certainly do not wish to crush her individuality in any manner whatsoever.
('59', 17, 1, 13, 32215) If the individauality of any person in the Ashram is crushed, that would harm the Ashram itself.
('59', 17, 1, 14, 32312) But I think Prema misunderstands the meaning of individuality.
('59', 17, 1, 15, 32375) I understand her problem, but I feel helpless before her obstinacy.
('59', 17, 1, 16, 32443) I understand what you say regarding Liladhar.
('59', 17, 1, 17, 32489) Has he abandoned his plan of going to Zanzibar?
('59', 17, 1, 18, 32537) If you decide to take him back, have a frank talk with him before doing so.
('59', 17, 1, 19, 32613) If the harassment by the Chharas has stopped, is it because our people have started going in their midst or does it mean something else?
('59', 17, 1, 20, 32750) I have discussed everything with Prabhudas 1. Your letter did not give the statistics of people’s weights.

('59', 17, 2, 24, 32972) After he is released, he wishes to stay in the Ashram for two months or so and have experience of the life there.
('59', 17, 2, 25, 33086) And so does Sitaram.
('59', 17, 2, 26, 33107) I have told them that there will be no difficulty in admitting them.
('59', 17, 2, 27, 33176) They will write to you.
('59', 17, 2, 28, 33200) If you can accommodate them, admit them.
('59', 17, 2, 29, 33241) Did anything happen between Balwant, Prabhashankar’s 2 son, and you?
('59', 17, 2, 30, 33310) How is Ratilal?
('59', 17, 2, 31, 33326) I hope Totaramji 3 is completely all right now.

('59', 18, 8, 12, 34061) KRISHNADAS1, I have read your letter to Prabhudas.
('59', 18, 8, 13, 34112) It is ignorance, and therefore an error, to go on working without regard to one’s health till the body breaks down.
('59', 18, 8, 14, 34228) You should take rest even for being able to serve, as you wish to do.
('59', 18, 8, 15, 34298) I hope that Prabhudas did not drag you as far as Bombay.
('59', 18, 8, 16, 34355) He could have easily gone there by himself and also seen Vinoba.
('59', 18, 8, 17, 34420) I will suggest this to him if it is not too late—let me know if it is.

('59', 19, 2, 3, 34947) January 15, 1933
('59', 19, 3, 4, 34964) PREMA, Your continued sulking shows that you have a good measure of childishness in you.
('59', 19, 3, 5, 35053) If you do not tolerate my criticizing you, you are not at all likely to tolerate anybody else doing so.
('59', 19, 3, 6, 35157) Instead of thanking me for [telling you] the impression you produce on me, you get angry with me.
('59', 19, 3, 7, 35255) Your duty is to try to ask me again to explain my charge against you, if you have not understood it.
('59', 19, 3, 8, 35356) You may also quarrel with me.
('59', 19, 3, 9, 35386) But all your education and wisdom seem to have disappeared on this occasion.
('59', 19, 3, 10, 35463) You cannot even see that behind your sulking lies your extreme pride.
('59', 19, 3, 11, 35533) Let me tell you that this is not freedom but self will.
('59', 19, 3, 12, 35589) I wish that you should open your eyes and understand my love, and not falsify my estimate of you.
('59', 19, 3, 13, 35687) It is not right for you to sulk; on the contrary, you should feel sorry and weep for having made me suffer.
('59', 19, 3, 14, 35795) Why don’t you realize that, if I say anything harsh to you, it is for your own good?
('59', 19, 3, 15, 35880) If I am making any mistake in doing so, it is your duty to point it out humbly to me.
('59', 19, 3, 16, 35966) If you are sure that you are innocent, you should be confident of being able to prove it to me.
('59', 19, 3, 17, 36062) Instead, you resent my criticism and sulk, and thereby seem to aggravate your guilt.
('59', 19, 3, 18, 36147) I had never expected this from you.
('59', 19, 3, 19, 36183) Wake up and express sorrow for nursing resentment against me.

('59', 19, 9, 28, 36586) It will not matter if you are not able to return to the Ashram at all.
('59', 19, 9, 29, 36657) Create the atmosphere of the Ashram wherever you live.

('59', 20, 7, 12, 37216) Or you should come to Poona and stay here for some time.

('59', 20, 14, 22, 37600) I got your letter.
('59', 20, 14, 23, 37619) I am writing this letter only to reassure you.
('59', 20, 14, 24, 37666) You need not reply to this.
('59', 20, 14, 25, 37694) Poor Pradhan, he has a reason to describe me as a young man.
('59', 20, 14, 26, 37755) But should he do that before you?
('59', 20, 14, 27, 37789) But apart from that, would it be surprising if an old man of twenty should regard you, a man of forty five, as being ‘dateless’?
('59', 20, 15, 28, 37918) I don’t mind differences of opinion at all.
('59', 20, 15, 29, 37962) Where the heart is one, why should we mind such differences?

('59', 21, 6, 9, 38439) January 15, 1933
('59', 21, 7, 10, 38456) The words “twenty four hours” you have taken rather literally.
('59', 21, 7, 11, 38519) You should have understood my intention in using them.
('59', 21, 7, 12, 38574) For twenty four hours mean for as long as possible.
('59', 21, 7, 13, 38626) When it is raining or is very hot, when there is a strong wind or it is extremely cold, or when for any other reason it is absolutely impossible or will be harmful to remain or sleep or work in the open, one’s moral duty is to take shelter under a shade or a roof or in a house with the doors and the windows shut.
('59', 21, 7, 14, 38941) All that you should have read in my words is that it is desirable to spend as much time as possible in the open without anything between oneself and the sky.
('59', 21, 7, 15, 39099) Those who understand this will spend the least possible time inside their houses and will also see that there is adequate ventilation inside.
('59', 21, 7, 16, 39241) And now about knowing the time of the day.
('59', 21, 7, 17, 39284) A village worker does not require a clock or a watch.
('59', 21, 7, 18, 39338) All his activities follow nature.
('59', 21, 7, 19, 39372) His clock also is nature’s.
('59', 21, 7, 20, 39400) His manner of indicating time is different from ours.
('59', 21, 7, 21, 39454) He will not ask a person to come at four.
('59', 21, 7, 22, 39496) He will say: ‘Come at prayer time,, or ‘Come an hour or two before sunset’, or ‘Come at daybreak’, or ‘Come when the birds start singing’, or ‘Come at dinner time’, or ‘Come when I am weaving tape’, or ‘Come at twilight’ or ‘at supper time’.
('59', 21, 7, 23, 39738) One can thus use different descriptions for different hours of the day.
('59', 21, 7, 24, 39810) And the worker is so regular in his tasks that he does not need to look at the sky to know the time of the day.
('59', 21, 7, 25, 39922) Every day he does the same job at the same hour and takes the same time for doing it.
('59', 21, 7, 26, 40008) Because of this exact regularity, when the work is over he knows what time of day it is.
('59', 21, 7, 27, 40097) Since he is not in the habit of consulting a watch, he cannot say how many hours he would require
('59', 21, 8, 28, 40195) 1 Addressee’s wife 2 The addressee was working in Orissa

('59', 22, 1, 2, 40296) for a given job.
('59', 22, 1, 3, 40313) But he says that he weaves a certain number of yards of tape daily, and from that he and others can judge for how many hours he must be working.
('59', 22, 1, 4, 40458) It was because of this that in former days time was not counted in hours but was measured by the amount of work done.
('59', 22, 1, 5, 40576) Even when the village worker travelled, he experienced no difficulty, for he knew how many miles he could walk between sunrise and sunset.
('59', 22, 1, 6, 40715) Such a worker rests not according to the clock but only when he feels tired.
('59', 22, 1, 7, 40792) In short, one feels very little need for a clock in a village; one may say that one feels no need at all.
('59', 22, 1, 8, 40898) The village worker measures his work by reference to the movements of the sun or the other heavenly bodies.
('59', 22, 1, 9, 41006) Clouds are no obstacles to this, because there are very few days in the year when the sky is covered with clouds.
('59', 22, 1, 10, 41120) Even on such days, however, his work goes on as usual.
('59', 22, 1, 11, 41175) Prayer time also is observed without any conscious effort.
('59', 22, 1, 12, 41234) If one’s hours of the day are filled with work and succeed one another in the same order, one will know without looking at the clock when it is time for prayer.
('59', 22, 1, 13, 41395) It will, then, rarely happen that one gets up late and has to worry about how to make up for the lost time.
('59', 22, 1, 14, 41503) It is not necessary to adjust the time of evening prayer with the prayer hour in the Ashram.
('59', 22, 1, 15, 41596) People living in different parts of the world cannot do a particular thing at the same hour.
('59', 22, 1, 16, 41689) It will, therefore, be most convenient for you to start your prayer when the sun sets in that part of the country.
('59', 22, 1, 17, 41804) I think I have answered all your doubts, big and small.

('59', 23, 13, 17, 42981) How can I help when He prompts me to undertake an indefinite fast?
('59', 23, 13, 18, 43048) I can show that the use of legislatures to secure freedom to the Harijans to enter temples is not opposed to the principle of non co operation.
('59', 23, 13, 19, 43192) But I would be violating jail rules by doing so.

('59', 25, 15, 18, 45319) DEAR COL.
('59', 25, 15, 19, 45329) DOYLE, Sjt.
('59', 25, 15, 20, 45341) Mathuradas, the only grandson of a deceased sister of mine, was recently discharged from Belgaum Prison.
('59', 25, 15, 21, 45446) He met me and told me that my letters were delivered to him with passages cut out.
('59', 25, 15, 22, 45529) Now my letters never contain anything that might possibly be considered of an obnoxious nature from the prison or any other standpoint.
('59', 25, 15, 23, 45665) They go from here duly censored.
('59', 25, 15, 24, 45698) The Superintendents here have done me the favour of drawing my attention to passages in my letters which they may not like.
('59', 25, 15, 25, 45822) But to cut out words or passages from a letter
('59', 25, 16, 26, 45869) 1 By Vasantram Shastri
('59', 26, 0, 1, 45892) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 27
('59', 26, 1, 2, 45936) without reference to the writer may lead to dangerous interpretations or interpretations not intended by the writer.
('59', 26, 1, 3, 46053) In my opinion any letter of which a passage is held objectionable should be referred to the writer and option given to him either of withdrawing the passage or the letter altogether.
('59', 26, 1, 4, 46236) And I cannot understand the practice of double censoring.
('59', 26, 1, 5, 46294) My letters are all thought out and conceived as one piece.
('59', 26, 1, 6, 46353) They contain mostly ethical matters.
('59', 26, 1, 7, 46390) The removal of a word may change the meaning.
('59', 26, 1, 8, 46436) I should not like my letters to be interfered with without my knowledge.
('59', 26, 1, 9, 46509) I may say that I often receive Maniben Patel’s letters with large patches making the letters meaningless.
('59', 26, 1, 10, 46615) I wish you could grant relief in this matter by no means trivial to me.

('59', 26, 6, 15, 46798) January 16, 1933
('59', 26, 7, 16, 46815) DEAR COL.
('59', 26, 7, 17, 46825) DOYLE, I hope that you have now overtaken the Christmas week arrears and are comparatively free to devote a little attention to an important matter which we have often talked about but never thoroughly thrashed out.
('59', 26, 7, 18, 47041) I refer to the question of handcarding and hand spinning in the prisons.
('59', 26, 7, 19, 47114) I have told you that as early as 1922 these two things were first introduced at my request in this prison.
('59', 26, 7, 20, 47221) At first Sjt.
('59', 26, 7, 21, 47235) Shankerlal Banker and I were permitted to do this work on our own bows and wheels with our own cotton.
('59', 26, 7, 22, 47338) Then cotton was brought by Col.
('59', 26, 7, 23, 47370) Dalziel from Dharwar.
('59', 26, 7, 24, 47392) The result of our work was liked by Major Jones who followed Col.
('59', 26, 7, 25, 47458) Dalziel and he allowed all Civil Disobedience prisoners who volunteered to do this work regularly.
('59', 26, 7, 26, 47557) I was permitted to regulate and examine the daily work and issue the necessary instructions for improvement.
('59', 26, 7, 27, 47666) A record was kept of the work.
('59', 26, 7, 28, 47697) Spinning wheels and bows were manufac tured in the prison, spindles were made and the yarn was used as welt, and, if I am not mistaken, also for tapes.
('59', 26, 7, 29, 47849) I was allowed to train convict warders as carders, and a considerable quantity of yarn was thus produced.
('59', 26, 7, 30, 47955) On the resumption of Civil Disobedience in 1930 the question
('59', 27, 0, 1, 48016) 28 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 27, 1, 2, 48057) was raised by me and several prisoners and permission was granted in some cases and not in others.
('59', 27, 1, 3, 48156) There was no fixed policy evolved when peace was declared and the C. D. prisoners were discharged.
('59', 27, 1, 4, 48255) The matter this time is also in the same uncertain state.
('59', 27, 1, 5, 48313) In Dhulia for instance Seth Jamnalal Bajaj tells me hand spinning is universal among the C. D. prisoners, so much so that much khadi has been manufactured out of the yarn so spun.
('59', 27, 1, 6, 48493) I know that in some other jails too it is freely allowed.
('59', 27, 1, 7, 48551) It is only here that almost complete prohibition reigns except with me, my companions and certain other prisoners and the female Civil Disobedience prisoners.
('59', 27, 1, 8, 48710) I have told you that many Civil Disobedience prisoners have been under vows to spin regularly as a sacrifice.
('59', 27, 1, 9, 48820) It is only after much effort that I have succeeded generally in persuading the Civil Disobe dience prisoners not to regard the vow as binding in prisons.
('59', 27, 1, 10, 48974) They know that I am trying to persuade you to give the permission to spin to those who regard it as a sacred duty, either as part of their task or as extra work to be kept by them for their use.
('59', 27, 1, 11, 49169) To carding and spinning by itself I am sure the Government can have no objection.
('59', 27, 1, 12, 49251) It has no connection with the Civil Disobedience campaign.
('59', 27, 1, 13, 49310) Spinning organizations have not been declared unlawful nor spinning an unlawful activity.
('59', 27, 1, 14, 49400) From the State point of view I can demons trate, as I did in 1922 by actual results, that it is a more remunerative occupation than several others followed in the prisons.
('59', 27, 1, 15, 49572) Indeed I endeavoured to show to one of your predecessors, viz., Col.
('59', 27, 1, 16, 49641) Mel, that it was possible even to make prisons self supporting by a universal introduction of all cotton processes in the prisons.
('59', 27, 1, 17, 49772) But whilst I was carrying on these conversations, he retired.
('59', 27, 1, 18, 49834) Inspectors General and Superintendents change rapidly and I was discharged all too prematurely owing to the attack of appendicitis.
('59', 27, 1, 19, 49966) If I can but get a little encouragement from you, I have the same confidence as in 1922 and could show you startling results.
('59', 27, 1, 20, 50092) But that may be a far cry.
('59', 27, 1, 21, 50119) My present purpose is to ask you please to regularize the practice, which is now followed haphazard, of allowing volunteers to do hand carding and hand spinning with such restrictions as may be considered necessary in the interest of the administration.
('59', 27, 2, 22, 50373) Yours sincerely,

('59', 29, 8, 15, 52106) The latest one in front of me is full of hot spices, reckless statements and innuendoes.
('59', 29, 8, 16, 52195) If your letter had not betrayed anger, I would have pleaded with you and shown you the mis statements and misrepresentations with which your letter bristles.

('59', 30, 2, 3, 52686) January 16, 1933
('59', 30, 3, 4, 52703) DEAR FRIEND, The letters that come to me from Travancore, that is, from Trivandrum, and all practically from M.A.s and B.A.s who are also High Court vakils, are very remarkable for hard heartedness and want of susceptibility to the upward impulse of humaneness.
('59', 30, 3, 5, 52965) The writers seem to exhaust the whole of their effort in resorting to subtleties of argument for defending the obviously indefensible.
('59', 30, 3, 6, 53100) I was ill prepared for such an exhibition of ungenerous interpretation of Shastras from a place of which I have such happy memories.
('59', 30, 3, 7, 53233) It is to me a vast tragedy that you, who have such a magnificent natural scenery about you, expressive of bountiful Nature, should steel your hearts against your own kith and kin and find it in you to make an appeal to me for peace 1 when, un mindful of consequences, perhaps all unconsciously to yourself, you are engaged in carrying on destruction.
('59', 30, 3, 8, 53584) I would not have written thus to you if I had not traced a ring of sincerity about your letter.

('59', 30, 8, 14, 53830) According to me, the reasons why your body does not become strong and healthy are these: though you eat, you do not have faith in the food which you eat and feel aversion towards it, you waste your mental energy too much and neglect your health out of ignorant attachment to work.
('59', 30, 8, 15, 54111) The remedy is indicated by the reasons themselves.
('59', 30, 8, 16, 54162) You should cure your lack of faith, look upon the food which you eat as a sign of God’s kindness and pray, while eating it,
('59', 30, 9, 17, 54286) 1 The addressee had pleaded: “Please drop temple entry; vouch peace; destroy not; but, fulfil.”
('59', 31, 0, 1, 54382) 32 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 31, 1, 2, 54423) that it may give you strength.
('59', 31, 1, 3, 54454) You should realize that it is necessary to preserve the body in good health for the sake of the atman, regard it as a trust and take the best care of it that you can.
('59', 31, 1, 4, 54621) Anybody who neglects a trust is guilty of a wrong.
('59', 31, 2, 5, 54672) I do not know when I first became aware of the existence of God.
('59', 31, 2, 6, 54737) Doing these things becomes so natural to me that I feel I have always been doing them.
('59', 31, 2, 7, 54824) Who can say that the leaves of a tree became so big on such and such a day?
('59', 31, 2, 8, 54900) All that I can say is that I have arrived at the present stage at the age of sixty four.
('59', 31, 2, 9, 54989) But this means nothing.
('59', 31, 3, 10, 55013) When a person has attained the Brahmi state 1, he does not suffer at the sight of others’ sufferings because he does not rejoice at the sight of their happiness.
('59', 31, 3, 11, 55175) A carpenter does not feel either happy or unhappy when repairing a ship; a Brahmin acts in the same manner.

('59', 32, 7, 13, 56653) You may, by all means, wear the bangles and the kumkum if you are fond of them.
('59', 32, 7, 14, 56733) Anyway, you may wear them if Mother wants you to; you must not hurt her feelings.

('59', 33, 14, 17, 58110) I am quite sure that Seth Chamanlal 2 could not believe that there was any likelihood of a civil war in the country.
('59', 33, 14, 18, 58227) As I have said in my appeal to sanatanists, such a thing I hold to be inconceivable.
('59', 33, 14, 19, 58312) If anybody knows the reformers, I should surely know them.
('59', 33, 14, 20, 58371) War could take place only if there are two parties to fight one another.
('59', 33, 14, 21, 58444) Self styled sanatanists would be simply beating the air if they staged a war.
('59', 33, 14, 22, 58522) And why should there be a war?
('59', 33, 14, 23, 58553) The Viceroy gives formal sanction not to a Bill passed but to a Bill that has been introduced, which even when passed ensures absolute freedom from fight.
('59', 33, 14, 24, 58708) The fight may come when the matter goes out of the reformers’ hands and disappointed and enraged Harijans take the matter in their

('59', 34, 1, 4, 59321) The Bill can only pass if it has solid Hindu opinion behind it and not otherwise.
('59', 34, 1, 5, 59403) I hope, therefore, that nobody will be scared by thetelegram to which you have just drawn my attention.

('59', 34, 5, 9, 59583) MY DEAR MARY, I have your letter.
('59', 34, 5, 10, 59617) Whatever you are, you are no guest.
('59', 34, 5, 11, 59653) 1 You are a member of the ever growing family.
('59', 34, 5, 12, 59700) Whether you are daughter, or sister or mother, matters little.
('59', 34, 5, 13, 59763) In this strange family, each one makes his or her own choice of the position he or she would occupy.
('59', 34, 5, 14, 59864) Therefore you understand you will be no guest to me wherever we meet.
('59', 34, 5, 15, 59934) My conception of idol worship is wholly different from that of the learned men.
('59', 34, 5, 16, 60014) I know from the experience of many people that idol worship has given them spiritualism of the highest type and that a philosophic conception of God has made such philosophers grossly material.
('59', 34, 5, 17, 60208) As I have told you, whilst the form may be different, mankind are idol worshippers by their very nature.
('59', 34, 5, 18, 60313) It is true that not all are uplifted by such worship, but that can be said of every form of worship.
('59', 34, 5, 19, 60414) Those who look down upon idol worship with philosophic contempt are not idol worshippers but probably the worst form of idolaters, for they are worshippers of self.
('59', 34, 5, 20, 60579) Ba is in the Ashram.
('59', 34, 5, 21, 60600) She left here some time ago.

('59', 35, 3, 7, 61401) This is my advice.

('59', 35, 3, 10, 61546) Teach them cleanliness.
('59', 35, 3, 11, 61570) If they come in a dirty condition to the school, wash them.
('59', 35, 3, 12, 61630) See that their eyes, ears, nose and hair are quite clean.
('59', 35, 3, 13, 61688) Let there be no dirt in their nails.
('59', 35, 3, 14, 61725) If their clothes are rags, you should beg some khaddar and get a volunteer tailor or your own mothers to make nice little vests and chaddis 1 for them.
('59', 35, 3, 15, 61877) You should take them for walks to see interesting sights.
('59', 35, 3, 16, 61935) Tell them stories from Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc., and by being truthful and kind under every circumstance, teach them to be likewise; and to all this you may add booklearning including simple arithmetic.

('59', 37, 1, 3, 64532) I do not know that he tried much either.
('59', 37, 1, 4, 64573) The impression that he has left on my mind is that he is convinced that our case is unassailable, but he has not the courage to come out boldly for the purification of Hinduism.
('59', 37, 1, 5, 64751) Of course this is not for publication, but if Moti Baboo sees him, I do not mind his showing this letter to him.
('59', 37, 1, 6, 64864) I do not want to say of him what I am not prepared to say in front of him.
('59', 37, 1, 7, 64939) He promised to send his son or some other representative to me who was to engage in a quiet discussion with me on the meaning of the Shastras for a number of days.
('59', 37, 1, 8, 65103) I thought the son or another Shastri was to come soon after he reached Bombay.
('59', 37, 1, 9, 65182) I observed that the son was one of the Shastris who were to hold the discussion on the 12th, a discussion which unfor tunately never came off.
('59', 37, 1, 10, 65325) It is a painful episode 1, not worth describing.

('59', 38, 8, 13, 66885) All the advice that I would give you just now is that you should be patient and watch the progress of the campaign against untouchability, giving the reformers all the help they may need, and you can anticipate their need by carrying on social reformation of a concentrated character amongst the Harijans and preparing a statement giving accurately a list of all the social and other disabilities that they may be suffering from.

('59', 39, 3, 7, 67861) Rasik Lal Biswas.
('59', 39, 3, 8, 67879) I have advised him to see you.
('59', 39, 3, 9, 67910) Do please invite him to see you.
('59', 39, 3, 10, 67943) What is this agitation against the Yeravda Pact?
('59', 39, 3, 11, 67992) I would like you to give me the inwardness of the opposition.
('59', 39, 3, 12, 68054) How can there be any injustice in the Pact, simply because of reservation of more seats for Harijans than had been provided in the British Government decision?
('59', 39, 3, 13, 68214) Are they not also Hindus?
('59', 39, 3, 14, 68240) Was there not always the cry on our part that the Harijans could take as many seats as they liked, even cent per cent?
('59', 39, 3, 15, 68359) This opposition, if it is popular, is likely to estrange Harijans and to justify the fears often expressed on their behalf as to the attitude of caste Hindus.
('59', 39, 3, 16, 68518) But you know the local situation infinitely better than I do.
('59', 39, 3, 17, 68580) You will correct me if I have erred in putting the argument.
('59', 39, 3, 18, 68641) I have given no public reply, because I felt that any reply from me at the present stage might increase the resentment of the Harijans.
('59', 39, 3, 19, 68777) In any case, I did not want to say anything without first understanding the situation through you.
('59', 39, 3, 20, 68876) Please guide me.
('59', 39, 3, 21, 68893) I hope Kamala and Dr. Alam are making steady progress.

('59', 39, 7, 25, 69024) January 17, 1933
('59', 39, 8, 26, 69041) NARANDAS, Some of the developments there are such as cause me worry, and so these days I wait for a letter from you almost every day.
('59', 39, 8, 27, 69175) This does not mean of course that you should write daily.
('59', 39, 8, 28, 69233) When there is no letter from you, I must assume, and I shall, that you had nothing to write about.
('59', 39, 8, 29, 69332) I have only explained the state of my mind.
('59', 39, 8, 30, 69376) You will have to take the necessary step about the Giri family even at the risk of appearing cruel.
('59', 39, 8, 31, 69476) I feel all the time that it is against their interests and those of the Ashram to let them remain.
('59', 39, 8, 32, 69575) We must realize that Mahavir is supported in his behaviour by all of them.
('59', 40, 0, 1, 69650) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 41
('59', 40, 1, 2, 69694) Chimanlal has won the confidence of Krishnamaiyadevi 1 in some measure.
('59', 40, 1, 3, 69766) After he has had a talk with her, call a meeting of the committee which you have appointed there and let it decide finally.
('59', 40, 1, 4, 69890) Since the question is a serious one, it is desirable that you alone should not take the responsibility.
('59', 40, 1, 5, 69994) If you have not already written to the people from whom Mahavir has borrowed, do so immediately and ascertain the facts.
('59', 40, 1, 6, 70115) Sitla Sahai 2 may have been arrested.
('59', 40, 1, 7, 70153) Write to Sarojinidevi 3
('59', 40, 2, 8, 70177) occasionally.
('59', 40, 2, 9, 70191) Inquire what happened about Padma 4. Keep an eye on her monthly expenses.

('59', 40, 6, 12, 70396) January 17, 1933
('59', 40, 7, 13, 70413) NARANDAS, These days I write to you almost daily.
('59', 40, 7, 14, 70463) I got today both your weekly mail and the letters despatched on the 15th.
('59', 40, 7, 15, 70537) I don’t remember what I wrote to Madhavlal.
('59', 40, 7, 16, 70581) It did not seem necessary to me to consult you about the matter.
('59', 40, 7, 17, 70646) If you wish, however, you may write to him and tell him that, instead of asking me for an explanation, he should write to you directly.
('59', 40, 7, 18, 70782) What do you mean when you say that the mill will start working soon?
('59', 40, 7, 19, 70851) Do you mean the ordinary hand mill of stone?
('59', 40, 7, 20, 70896) If you have decided to revive it, I assume that you must have taken all the factors into consideration.
('59', 40, 7, 21, 71000) I hope you did not think from any of my letters that I wished it to be done.
('59', 40, 7, 22, 71077) Personally I believe that we shall not be able to revive it now.
('59', 40, 7, 23, 71142) We do not even get good hand mills now.
('59', 40, 7, 24, 71182) It is easy and cheap to get grain ground in flour mills.
('59', 40, 7, 25, 71239) I think it will be difficult to give up the practice.
('59', 40, 7, 26, 71293) But we can grind small quantities of grain in the Ashram with our own mills or with American hand mills.
('59', 40, 7, 27, 71398) If such a mill is of a good quality, it never gives trouble.
('59', 40, 7, 28, 71459) When any of

('59', 41, 5, 8, 71902) RUKMINI1, Your letters are becoming increasingly dull.
('59', 41, 5, 9, 71957) I would not be surprised if in time you begin to write as Chhotelalji does.
('59', 41, 5, 10, 72033) Sometimes his letters come to me in this form: “ BAPU,
('59', 41, 6, 11, 72088) Regards from

('59', 41, 12, 16, 72336) January 17, 1933
('59', 41, 13, 17, 72353) It is not correct to say that I am a champion of mixed marriages.
('59', 41, 13, 18, 72419) It can be said that I do not oppose such marriages.
('59', 41, 13, 19, 72471) There is a difference between the two statements.
('59', 41, 13, 20, 72521) The statement that I am a champion of mixed marriages or even that I am not opposed to them is likely to give rise to some misunderstanding in so far as your idea of a mixed marriage is different from mine.
('59', 41, 13, 21, 72728) Today we hardly come across any true Brahmins or true Shudras.
('59', 41, 13, 22, 72791) Therefore what you do not regard as a mixed marriage is likely to be one and what, if I accepted the popular parlance, would be a mixed marriage may not actually be such.
('59', 41, 13, 23, 72962) For instance, if a so called Shudra girl possessing the qualities of a Brahmin girl marries a real Brahmin I would not call it a mixed
('59', 41, 14, 24, 73097) 1 Daughter of Maganlal Gandhi and wife of Benarsilal Bazaj

('59', 42, 1, 2, 73200) marriage, whereas you would regard it as such.
('59', 42, 1, 3, 73247) On the other hand, if a so called Brahmin boy with the qualities of a Shudra marries a so called Shudra girl with Brahmin like qualities it would be a mixed marriage in my view.
('59', 42, 1, 4, 73425) You would also regard it as one.
('59', 42, 1, 5, 73458) Both of us will, however, do it for different reasons.
('59', 42, 1, 6, 73513) You should understand from this that I never reject a scientific truth that has been established.
('59', 42, 1, 7, 73611) But you should also note that in [the realm of] science what has come to be accepted as truth today is not unlikely to be proved as untruth tomorrow.
('59', 42, 1, 8, 73761) Sciences founded on deduction are always bound to suffer this basic imperfection.
('59', 42, 1, 9, 73843) We cannot therefore regard it as an absolute truth.
('59', 42, 1, 10, 73895) I think I understand and also believe in varnashrama dharma.
('59', 42, 1, 11, 73956) But you and I seem to understand the purport of varnashrama dharma in different ways.
('59', 42, 2, 12, 74042) In spite of saying all this I ought to caution you that if you propose to consider the question of untouchability in a scientific way you should understand that interdining and mixed marriage have nothing to do with the question, and you should act accordingly.
('59', 42, 2, 13, 74304) As for me today I am living, but tomorrow I may not be there, but this problem is certainly going to be there even after me.
('59', 42, 2, 14, 74429) At the moment I am not at all canvassing for interdining and mixed marriage.
('59', 42, 2, 15, 74506) We shall see about it when I start advocating them.
('59', 42, 2, 16, 74558) It is neither scientific nor moral to condemn, because of faults you find in me, the noble work that I happen to be doing.

('59', 42, 5, 23, 74933) I am aware of the distressing fact that there are five or six divisions among the Harijans.

('59', 43, 8, 15, 75973) January 18, 1933
('59', 43, 9, 16, 75990) Of carded cotton yields 840 yards of yarn of 1 count, i.e., 8400 yards of yarn of 10 counts.
('59', 43, 9, 17, 76083) An average good spinner spins at least 150 yards per hour of 10 counts.
('59', 43, 9, 18, 76155) Therefore in 6 working hours he will spin 900 yards—4.14 tolas.
('59', 43, 9, 19, 76219) Therefore 9 such men will spin 1 lb.
('59', 43, 9, 20, 76256) of yarn per day.
('59', 43, 9, 21, 76273) At the rate of 3 as.
('59', 43, 9, 22, 76294) per lb.
('59', 43, 9, 23, 76302) of 10 [count] yarn as the ordinary wage of a spinner, 9 men will earn 3 as.
('59', 43, 9, 24, 76378) a day, i.e., 1/3 of an anna each.
('59', 43, 9, 25, 76412) At the present moment at least.
('59', 43, 9, 26, 76444) 1000 C. D. prisoners in this jail are not producing even half of this small amount of wealth.
('59', 43, 9, 27, 76538) In other words there is a dead waste of at least Rs. 10 per day in the Yeravda Central Prison.
('59', 43, 9, 28, 76633) The outlay required for producing the yarn is 120 lb.
('59', 43, 9, 29, 76687) of cotton per day.
('59', 43, 9, 30, 76706) It is likely that it will not be necessary to supply spinning wheels to all these spinners.
('59', 43, 9, 31, 76798) I am unable to say off hand how many will have their own spinning wheels.
('59', 43, 9, 32, 76872) But that will need to be ascertained.
('59', 43, 9, 33, 76910) I have given the lowest possible estimates so as to err on

('59', 44, 1, 2, 77060) the safest side.
('59', 44, 1, 3, 77077) It may also be stated that it is possible to do the spinning through the takli, the easiest and the cheapest method, but the output would be 1/3 compared to the wheel.
('59', 44, 1, 4, 77245) I suggest that the beginning should be made at once with those who volunteer to do the spinning and who can produce their own spinning wheels .
('59', 44, 1, 5, 77389) There remains now the question as to what to do with the yarn.
('59', 44, 1, 6, 77452) Yarn of 10 counts can be utilized to weave coarse cloth or the yarn as it is produced can be sold without the slightest difficulty.
('59', 44, 1, 7, 77584) I have made no reference in this note to carding.
('59', 44, 1, 8, 77634) The usual estimate is that one carding bow can supply ten spinners with carded cotton.
('59', 44, 1, 9, 77721) The processes to be gone through before spinning is begun are carding and sliver making in which last is the simplest.
('59', 44, 1, 10, 77840) If further particulars are required I will gladly supply them.
('59', 44, 1, 11, 77903) I have here confined myself only to the commercial aspect and made no reference to those with whom spinning is a part of daily sacrifice.
('59', 44, 1, 12, 78041) I think that for such the permission should be granted at once, in view of the fact that it is being done in several prisons.

('59', 45, 9, 13, 79413) Without knowing the condition of the Harijans it is impossible for me from here to say whether the suggestions made therein are proper and feasible.
('59', 45, 9, 14, 79562) Workers should generally take care that in advising Harijans they do not raise false or impossible hopes.
('59', 45, 9, 15, 79668) Anti untouchability workers are expected more to do some tangible service themselves rather than promote petitions, etc.
('59', 45, 9, 16, 79789) In the first instance, local bodies are to be expected to do their duty and when they manifestly fail to do so, public agitation undoubtedly becomes a necessity.

('59', 45, 13, 21, 80099) January 18, 1933
('59', 45, 14, 22, 80116) DEAR FRIEND, Do you mean to suggest that in Malabar the public temples do not belong to the Hindus who have the right of worship there?
('59', 45, 14, 23, 80252) Will you contend that even when the temple was first built, it was not the property of Hindus although Hindus subscribed to the cost of
('59', 46, 0, 1, 80388) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 47
('59', 46, 1, 2, 80432) building it?
('59', 46, 1, 3, 80445) And if that was so, then the trustees would not be trustees, but they would be absolute owners.
('59', 46, 1, 4, 80541) There are thousands of such temples owned by private persons.
('59', 46, 1, 5, 80603) A public temple is so called only because it is public property; that is to say, the property of those members of the public at whose instance and with whose money and on whose behalf the temple was built.
('59', 46, 1, 6, 80809) Do you think that the multitude of people who give donations daily have no right whatsoever to the temple to which they give donations?
('59', 46, 1, 7, 80945) Of course you may say that the right does not include authority to change the character or quality of those who are entitled to offer worship.
('59', 46, 1, 8, 81088) If you do so, you will simply beg the question.
('59', 46, 1, 9, 81136) For the contention of the reformers is that the so called Harijans are only so called, and that they should never have been excluded from rights enjoyed by any other members of the Hindu family, provided that they conform to the regulations as to cleanliness and the like.
('59', 46, 1, 10, 81409) The purity of the temples themselves is irrelevant to the present discussion.
('59', 46, 1, 11, 81487) You don’t want to say that if a temple has dancing girls and swindling Brahmins, it should be opened to Harijans, and not if the Brahmins cease to swindle and the girls cease to dance in those temples?
('59', 46, 1, 12, 81689) Do indeed see Malaviyaji, if he can give you a few moments, and Dr. Bhagwandas.
('59', 46, 1, 13, 81769) He certainly has more leisure than Malaviyaji.
('59', 46, 1, 14, 81816) About my fast you need have no fear.

('59', 47, 8, 11, 82620) MY DEAR AMTUSSALAAM, I must hurry on to write to you.
('59', 47, 8, 12, 82674) Therefore this English letter.
('59', 47, 8, 13, 82705) I would like you to make up your mind quickly as to the treatment to be followed.
('59', 47, 8, 14, 82787) My advice is, if you get a doctor there who would take real interest in you, you should give him the fullest chance by obeying all his instructions and doing as he bids.
('59', 47, 8, 15, 82957) That is to say, you should do as Veenabehn advises you.
('59', 47, 8, 16, 83013) There should be no time wasted in simply making a decision.
('59', 47, 8, 17, 83073) You should be in the hospital and take what medicine or injection is given to you and undergo the operation that may be needed.
('59', 47, 8, 18, 83201) Do not think of the removal of the womb unless the doctor says so.
('59', 47, 8, 19, 83268) Never mind the letter written to Dr. Sharma.
('59', 47, 8, 20, 83313) You yourself say that he cannot cure piles.
('59', 47, 8, 21, 83357) After you are well you shall come and see me.
('59', 47, 8, 22, 83403) God may keep you well.

('59', 48, 2, 3, 83543) January 18, 1933
('59', 48, 3, 4, 83560) MY DEAR N., I have your two interesting and instructive letters.
('59', 48, 3, 5, 83625) It is very great work you are doing, and if the young men who have responded to your call remain steadfast and do not give in after the first flush of enthusiasm is exhausted, the street cleaning you are doing must prove infectious and it would be a great advance towards the removal of untouchability.
('59', 48, 3, 6, 83928) I am therefore surprised that anybody should cavil at the work itself or take exception to the fact that you, who have become an Indian by adoption and by right of love, should have taken the lead, and if anybody thinks that I would not have advised such work if I was out, he is wholly mistaken.
('59', 48, 3, 7, 84225) I have personally undertaken such work before now, both publicly and privately, and the cleaning of Harijan quarters that was done all over India on the 18th ultimo was due to the suggestion made by me and heartily taken up by the Servants of Untouchables Society.
('59', 48, 3, 8, 84490) You are at liberty to make public use of this letter.
('59', 48, 3, 9, 84544) I did think from the language of your previous letter that you had fasted all the days that I was fasting.
('59', 48, 3, 10, 84651) I am glad therefore of the correction you have made.
('59', 48, 3, 11, 84704) As you know, I am deeply interested in the question of scientific or (which is the same thing) hygienic and spiritual dietary.
('59', 48, 3, 12, 84831) Tell me therefore more about your diet.
('59', 48, 3, 13, 84871) Give me the actual things you take and the quantities, and how far you have been on this diet.
('59', 48, 3, 14, 84966) As you seem to have read practically everything I have ever written, perhaps you are aware that I have lived on fruits and nuts for over six years, that I have gone without milk for over nine years, and it has been the most disappointing thing for me to have been obliged to take even goat’s milk.
('59', 48, 3, 15, 85264) I know of no one of my acquaintance who has been able to do hard physical work as also hard mental work, as you seem to be doing, merely on fruits and vegetables, that means, no protein, no starch and no fat of any kind.
('59', 48, 3, 16, 85485) The two letters before me whet my appetite for seeing you face to face and understanding you more than

('59', 49, 1, 3, 85886) To know them I need to look at them and talk to them, and you have written so much to me about yourself that I do want to know you if I can.
('59', 49, 1, 4, 86027) But at the same time I don’t want you to come here at the sacrifice of the great work you are doing there.
('59', 49, 1, 5, 86134) You should come only when you can be spared for a few days from your work.

('59', 49, 11, 20, 86855) They discover weaknesses in me of which till now I was unaware.
('59', 49, 11, 21, 86919) My words are interpreted in strange ways and by such means the victory of sanatana dharma is declared with beat of drums.
('59', 49, 11, 22, 87041) We laugh at all this, knowing that there is no real strength behind it.
('59', 49, 11, 23, 87113) If there were real strength behind it, and also public opinion, then it would be not an occasion for laughter, but one for weeping; then one

('59', 50, 5, 7, 87630) January 18, 1933
('59', 50, 6, 8, 87647) SHRI BRAHMACHARIJI, Your letter.
('59', 50, 6, 9, 87680) I can see you on the 25th instant at 2 o’clock and shall reserve one hour for you.
('59', 50, 6, 10, 87763) I shall not give this time to anyone else.
('59', 50, 6, 11, 87806) But according to my vow I regard it a duty to answer your doubts.
('59', 50, 6, 12, 87872) (1) 1 I agree with all that you say in the first question but there is the difference of interpretation which is almost impossible to explain through correspondence.
('59', 50, 6, 13, 88038) All human beings are like blind men but all the devotees of truth are partially right in the same way that the seven blind men were right on their part in giving varying descriptions of the elephant on each touching different parts of its anatomy, (2) Untouchability as practised today is found nowhere in the Shastras.
('59', 50, 6, 14, 88358) This is the impression I have gathered on hearing what many Shastris say.
('59', 50, 6, 15, 88432) (3) Everything can be found in the Gita.
('59', 50, 6, 16, 88473) According to the change of place, time and circumstances, conduct as prescribed by the principle can change but never the principle itself.
('59', 50, 6, 17, 88613) (4) This too is a fact that we have degenerated and continue to do so because of failure in observing dharma.
('59', 50, 6, 18, 88723) (5) What you say is not true.
('59', 50, 7, 19, 88753) (6) In no way do I regard myself as more learned and wiser than anyone else.
('59', 50, 7, 20, 88830) (7) I have never taken such a vow 3 as you think I have.
('59', 50, 8, 21, 88887) 1 The addressee had asked whether Gandhiji had faith in the Vedas, whether he accepted their traditional interpretation or he had his own original interpretation.
('59', 50, 8, 22, 89050) 2 The addressee had stated that the Government was creating internal disunity in the country by allowing Gandhiji, even while in jail, to work for the removal of untouchability.

('59', 51, 0, 1, 89307) 52 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 51, 1, 2, 89348) (8) I do not appreciate the extreme rules of purification and so on.
('59', 51, 1, 3, 89417) (9) The observation that things follow their natural bent should be regarded as quite correct.
('59', 51, 1, 4, 89512) (10) Intermarriage and interdining have no connection with untouchability.
('59', 51, 1, 5, 89587) They are totally different; read what I have said on this subject.
('59', 51, 1, 6, 89654) Certain people, because of their hostile attitude, grossly misinterpret it.
('59', 51, 1, 7, 89730) (11) The idea of founding a new religion has never occurred to me even in a dream.
('59', 51, 1, 8, 89813) (12) It is perfectly right that the politics which does not serve to protect dharma deserves to be wholly disregarded.
('59', 51, 1, 9, 89932) (13) I cannot either give up or take up fasting.
('59', 51, 1, 10, 89981) (14) What you say is almost correct.
('59', 51, 2, 11, 90018) (15) I have firm faith in the worthiness of the object for which I am thinking of a ‘referendum’.
('59', 51, 2, 12, 90116) (16) I hold courteous dialogue with whosoever wants to talk to me, whether he is small or big.
('59', 51, 2, 13, 90211) What more can I do?

('59', 51, 7, 17, 90323) January 18, 1933
('59', 51, 8, 18, 90340) When his attention was drawn to the report of an interview 2 between him and
('59', 51, 9, 19, 90417) its correspondent appearing in a Madras paper Gandhiji said: I had decided not to express any opinion on the proposal that a committee should be appointed to gauge opinion in respect of temple entry, because I did not attach any importance to the proposal.
('59', 51, 9, 20, 90674) But now that mention has been made, I can unhesitatingly say that the appointment of such a committee would be a most unfortunate thing.
('59', 51, 10, 21, 90811) 1 The addressee had referred to the dehumanizing effects of the Western industrial civilization.
('59', 51, 10, 22, 90908) 2 Vide “Interview to “The Hindu” Correspondent”, 14 1 1933. For Gandhiji’s contradiction, vide “Telegram to The Hindu”, 18 1 1933
('59', 52, 0, 1, 91038) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 53
('59', 52, 1, 2, 91082) I do not believe that the Government can ever endorse such a proposal.
('59', 52, 2, 3, 91153) The report stated that Mr. Gandhi said that he had decided to express his views on the proposal and that if the Viceroy refused sanction to the introduction of Dr. Subbaroyan’s Bill, he (Mr. Gandhi) would resist it with his life.
('59', 52, 2, 4, 91383) While characterizing the report as a misrepresentation of a conversation never intended for publication, Mr. Gandhi said that he never told the correspondent that he had decided to express his views on.
('59', 52, 2, 5, 91586) the proposal for a committee.
('59', 52, 2, 6, 91616) On the contrary, he had decided not to do so.
('59', 52, 3, 7, 91662) Explaining why the appointment of a committee would be most unfortunate, Mr. Gandhi said that Dr. Subbaroyan’s Bill was thoroughly inoffensive.
('59', 52, 3, 8, 91806) It not only did not seek interference with religion, but was intended to sound the religious feelings of the people concerned.
('59', 52, 3, 9, 91933) There was no question of sanctioning any law; the only thing the Viceroy was requested to do was to give his formal consent to the introduction of the Bill, which was the result of the unanimous vote of the Madras Council.
('59', 52, 4, 10, 92156) Mr. Gandhi expressed surprise regarding the second part of the interview attributed to him, and said that he had no recollection whatsoever of having said that if the Viceroy refused to sanction, he would resist it with his life.
('59', 52, 4, 11, 92386) He had no such settled plan before him, and if he had, he was not in the habit of making premature announcements to the public and that, even before bringing such an important decision to the notice of the authorities concerned.
('59', 52, 4, 12, 92615) Indeed, he could say emphatically that he himself did not know what he would do if permission was withheld.
('59', 52, 4, 13, 92723) But I know it to be a terrific ordeal for me, if the progress of reform was interfered with by the refusal of sanction to the introduction of a measure indispensable for the growth of religious freedom.

('59', 52, 7, 16, 92970) January 19, 1933
('59', 52, 8, 17, 92987) MIRA, This is just after the morning prayer Thursday.
('59', 52, 8, 18, 93041) Vallabhbhai and I are waiting for the hot water for honey.
('59', 52, 8, 19, 93100) I have your letter before me.
('59', 52, 8, 20, 93130) Of course I wrote last week as usual on Thursday after the morning prayer.
('59', 52, 8, 21, 93205) If the letter was for any reason detained by the Superintendent there, he would have at least
('59', 53, 0, 1, 93299) 54 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 53, 1, 2, 93340) informed you of the fact so as to spare you the anxiety of imagining all sorts of evil.
('59', 53, 1, 3, 93428) I brought the matter to the notice of Major Bhandari and he promised to inquire.
('59', 53, 1, 4, 93509) The letter was duly posted at this end.
('59', 53, 1, 5, 93549) It may be, however, that the letter was withheld because, for the first time so far as I can recall, I sent you with my letter, letters of welfare from Madeleine Rolland, Andrews and copy of my letter to Madame Rolland.
('59', 53, 1, 6, 93769) I sent also a very beautiful picture card containing the Virgin and the divine babe.
('59', 53, 1, 7, 93854) I should be surprised if the letter was withheld for that reason and even then why the letter itself.
('59', 53, 1, 8, 93956) I therefore imagine that it has been waylaid during transit.
('59', 53, 1, 9, 94017) Anyway I am inquiring at this end and you may at yours.
('59', 53, 1, 10, 94073) For me that card was the greatest treasure with Aristarchi’s inscription at the back.
('59', 53, 1, 11, 94159) And from this incident learn the lesson that even if such a mishap occurs again feel assured that I have written as usual even though I may not have got your weekly message and that the mishap must be due to causes beyond my control.
('59', 53, 1, 12, 94393) If I got ill and could not write or if I was prevented for any other cause, you should be duly informed that no letter was sent during that week.
('59', 53, 1, 13, 94539) In other words do not imagine causes but wait patiently for the knowledge if it is to come and in any case never imagine the worst.
('59', 53, 1, 14, 94671) Since God is a God of mercy, if we must imagine, it is best to imagine the best.
('59', 53, 1, 15, 94752) Of course, a votary of the Gita never imagines anything.
('59', 53, 1, 16, 94809) Good and bad are after all relative terms.
('59', 53, 1, 17, 94852) He takes note of things as they happen and reacts naturally to them, fulfilling his part as if propelled by the Great Mechanic, even as a piece of machine in good order responds automatically to the call of the machinist.
('59', 53, 1, 18, 95074) It is the most difficult thing for an intelligent being to be like a machine.
('59', 53, 1, 19, 95152) And yet, if one is to become a zero, that is precisely what one desiring perfection has to become.
('59', 53, 1, 20, 95251) The vital difference between the machine and the man is that the machine is inert, the man is all life and consciously becomes like a machine in the hands of the Master Mechanic.
('59', 53, 1, 21, 95430) Krishna says in so many words that God moves all beings as if they were parts of a machine.
('59', 53, 2, 22, 95522) You see I have written this with the right hand.
('59', 53, 2, 23, 95571) I notice that the left too requires rest from even the little writing it does.
('59', 53, 2, 24, 95650) It is probable that the pain in the elbows has something to do with outward fatigue caused by writing or spinning or both.
('59', 53, 2, 25, 95773) It has certainly not yielded to the saltless, and how should it if the cause is not organic?
('59', 53, 2, 26, 95866) It produces

('59', 54, 1, 2, 95951) immediate effect in you, because with you the cause is organic.
('59', 54, 1, 3, 96015) I have no rheumatism.
('59', 54, 1, 4, 96037) If there was any, I should not fail to know it.
('59', 54, 1, 5, 96085) Anyway the saltless diet still continues.
('59', 54, 1, 6, 96127) And I showed yesterday an increase of one lb.
('59', 54, 1, 7, 96173) It is therefore now 104 lb.
('59', 54, 1, 8, 96201) You should, if you can, discover the cause of your giddiness.
('59', 54, 1, 9, 96263) Have you discussed it with the medical officer there?
('59', 54, 1, 10, 96317) You ought not [to] feel giddy at the end of your walk.
('59', 54, 1, 11, 96372) You should feel refreshed.
('59', 54, 1, 12, 96399) It is often a good thing to dash cold water on the face and even the head before starting the walk and sip cold water during the walk on the slightest warning of approaching giddiness.
('59', 54, 1, 13, 96584) Even stopping for a moment to take deep breath avoids it.
('59', 54, 1, 14, 96642) These are all bits out of my own experience.
('59', 54, 1, 15, 96687) I note what you say about your reading.
('59', 54, 1, 16, 96727) The Mahabharat is a good programme.
('59', 54, 1, 17, 96763) You ought to be a good Hindi scholar when you have finished reading the unabridged Hindi translation without missing the meaning of a single word.
('59', 54, 1, 18, 96910) That means a great feat.
('59', 54, 1, 19, 96935) But I know there is nothing that can defeat love.
('59', 54, 1, 20, 96985) If you are allowed to drop a postcard to acknowledge this and if it is delivered on receipt, drop me a postcard.
('59', 54, 1, 21, 97098) Love from us all.

('59', 54, 5, 25, 97219) January 19, 1933
('59', 54, 6, 26, 97236) DEAR FRIEND, I have gone through your printed letter very carefully.
('59', 54, 6, 27, 97305) You don’t expect me to argue out my position.
('59', 54, 6, 28, 97351) My argument is to be found in my writings.
('59', 54, 6, 29, 97394) Therefore, to you I can only say I have been endeavouring to follow the light that God gives me, and whatever I have written at any time, I have believed and have meant fully.
('59', 54, 6, 30, 97570) Where you find contradictions in my writings, I find nothing but a due fulfilment or elaboration of a previous position.
('59', 54, 6, 31, 97691) But I am not so much concerned with showing consistency in my writings as with stating that I have given to the readers the truth as I have known it at the time of writing.
('59', 54, 6, 32, 97864) I however heartily endorse your fear that whatever I have said believing it to be true may after all be found to have been a vast error.
('59', 55, 0, 1, 98001) 56 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 55, 1, 2, 98042) But I take comfort (very poor, you may say) in the thought that it is a possibility common, without exception, to the whole of mankind.
('59', 55, 1, 3, 98178) But you will perhaps agree that so long as I do not see the error of my ways myself I would be cowardly and disloyal to the truth I worship if I fail to act up to my conviction.
('59', 55, 2, 4, 98356) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('59', 55, 6, 9, 98491) MY DEAR GHANSHYAMDAS, I have your letter of 14th instant.
('59', 55, 6, 10, 98549) I had a prolonged conversation with Syts.
('59', 55, 6, 11, 98591) Deodhar and Vaze yesterday regarding the English edition, and as a result 1 I have telegraphed to Amritlal Thakkar to send Shastri 2 at once if he could be spared.
('59', 55, 6, 12, 98755) Vaze tells me that Shastri is the fittest man for doing the editorial work.
('59', 55, 6, 13, 98831) He himself will help but cannot be completely identified with the paper.
('59', 55, 6, 14, 98904) I can appreciate his reason.
('59', 55, 6, 15, 98933) But both told me that though Shastri had applied to the Society for admission as a probationer, the Society would have no objection to Shastri taking up the editorial responsibility.
('59', 55, 6, 16, 99116) Of course, so long as Mahadev and I have the time, the columns will be filled by us, and Shastri will carry out instructions, and in time to come write original articles himself.
('59', 55, 6, 17, 99295) I wonder when the Hindi edition will be out.

('59', 56, 3, 4, 99602) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('59', 56, 3, 5, 99635) I have read as you have about the movement in Bengal for the revision of the Yeravda Pact.
('59', 56, 3, 6, 99726) I can assure you that I have found no reason whatsoever to revise my own attitude.
('59', 56, 3, 7, 99809) You need not be anxious, for I am convinced that that Pact cannot be revised without the unanimous consent of all the parties concerned.

('59', 56, 9, 14, 100084) Oh yes, it is necessary for you to write to me, although P and L 2
('59', 56, 10, 15, 100151) write to me.
('59', 56, 10, 16, 100164) They cannot tell me what you can if you choose to write.
('59', 56, 10, 17, 100221) There is always an individuality about letters when they are written with a will.
('59', 56, 10, 18, 100303) You know or ought to know that letter writing is an art.
('59', 56, 10, 19, 100360) It can come to everyone who writes naturally and to the point.
('59', 56, 10, 20, 100423) You should try to acquire this art.

('59', 56, 14, 26, 100611) Please do not be impatient.
('59', 56, 14, 27, 100639) I will do the best I can.
('59', 56, 14, 28, 100665) I did not wish to deceive people by using the word ‘Harijan,.
('59', 56, 14, 29, 100727) Since the word Dhed and others like that in common use are not proper, I accepted the word ‘Harijan’ at the request of one or two

('59', 57, 6, 8, 101248) January 19, 1933
('59', 57, 7, 9, 101265) BHAI THAKKAR BAPA, Read the accompanying cutting carefully and then write to me giving me your views.
('59', 57, 7, 10, 101367) If we have made a mistake anywhere, we will admit it.
('59', 57, 7, 11, 101421) If the fast resulted in coercion on anybody but secured justice, we need not think about the matter.
('59', 57, 7, 12, 101522) But we should certainly think if it has resulted in injustice.
('59', 57, 7, 13, 101585) The article has had no effect on me.
('59', 57, 7, 14, 101622) Is this mere agitation or is there anything serious behind it?
('59', 57, 7, 15, 101685) If it is only agitation, what is the motive?
('59', 57, 8, 16, 101730) BAPU [PS.] I have just received your wire regarding Shastri.
('59', 57, 8, 17, 101791) I shall await your letter.
('59', 57, 8, 18, 101818) I had sent the wire yesterday in the presence of Deodhar and Vaze.
('59', 57, 8, 19, 101885) The latter had offered volunteers on the understanding that they would not participate directly.

('59', 57, 13, 23, 102077) BHAI THAKKAR BAPA, After I had written a letter to you [today], I got your letter of the 16th.
('59', 57, 13, 24, 102172) Hence this second letter.
('59', 57, 13, 25, 102198) I have already written to you regarding Ahmedabad.
('59', 57, 13, 26, 102249) Our letters crossed each other.
('59', 57, 13, 27, 102281) Karsandas had written to me about Gokhale’s death anniversary.
('59', 57, 13, 28, 102344) I do not at all wish to cheapen Gokhale’s name.

('59', 58, 1, 3, 102526) History will appreciate the purity of his character and the greatness of his services.
('59', 58, 1, 4, 102613) I don’t think they will be appreciated in our lifetime.
('59', 58, 1, 5, 102669) I don’t mind “Anti untouchability Days’, being celebrated independ ently.
('59', 58, 1, 6, 102743) This is my firm view.
('59', 58, 1, 7, 102765) Don’t you think it is based on very good reasons?
('59', 58, 1, 8, 102815) The Sangh has not yet reached its destination.
('59', 58, 1, 9, 102862) On the contrary, several swords are hanging over it.
('59', 58, 1, 10, 102915) Rajaji, of course, is holding an umbrella over it, but it is the Sangh’s lot to pass through an ordeal just now.
('59', 58, 1, 11, 103028) So what can an umbrella avail?
('59', 58, 1, 12, 103059) However, you may consult Harijan and other principal fighters.
('59', 58, 1, 13, 103122) If they agree, you may proceed further, otherwise bury Rajaji’s letter deep under the ground.
('59', 58, 1, 14, 103216) I had passed on to Ghanshyamdas the letter which I had received from him.
('59', 58, 1, 15, 103290) He is not particular about the name.
('59', 58, 1, 16, 103327) If I wish, he would agree to change it.
('59', 58, 1, 17, 103367) Personally I do wish [that it should be].
('59', 58, 1, 18, 103409) But time is all powerful.
('59', 58, 1, 19, 103435) He swallows our desires alive, like a snake and makes even a Mahatma like me look an alpatma 2. Hence I have held my tongue.
('59', 58, 1, 20, 103560) You have strong shoulders.
('59', 58, 1, 21, 103587) If you wish, you may take up the responsibility.
('59', 58, 1, 22, 103636) As for the name the saying is, “With great love, we name the child Hari, and it dies in infancy.” The Sangh will not succeed or fail because of its name.
('59', 58, 1, 23, 103790) It will be judged by its work.
('59', 58, 1, 24, 103821) If it works in the manner of the Yamaraj 3, I have no doubt that it will swallow the demon of untouchability alive.
('59', 58, 1, 25, 103937) You are wrong.
('59', 58, 1, 26, 103952) You yourself should have humorously advertised the Holloway ointment.
('59', 58, 1, 27, 104022) There are persons who will bear witness to its efficacy.
('59', 58, 1, 28, 104079) If you do not like doing it or have no time, forget about it.
('59', 58, 1, 29, 104141) I have got some free time and so could indulge in this bit of light talk.

('59', 59, 2, 3, 104416) January 20, 1933
('59', 59, 3, 4, 104433) I have seen your statement convening a Conference of sanatanists 1. I had purposely refrained from worrying you over the question of temple entry.
('59', 59, 3, 5, 104580) Much as I stood in need of your invaluable assistance, I knew that you were preoccupied with matters of the highest moment, and I felt that the least I could do, as also the most that was possible, was deliberately to forgo that assistance.
('59', 59, 3, 6, 104821) Friends in Kerala pressed me to ask you to go to their rescue.
('59', 59, 3, 7, 104884) I refused to do so, and I warned them against troubling you.
('59', 59, 3, 8, 104945) But now I see that you have yourself taken the initiative and a tremendous responsibility.
('59', 59, 3, 9, 105036) I hope and pray that great good will come out of the Conference.
('59', 59, 3, 10, 105101) I wish that it had been possible for us to meet before the Conference, or that we had exchanged ideas before you propounded your suggestions about temple entry.
('59', 59, 3, 11, 105262) I feel, however, that I should submit to you my own position.
('59', 59, 3, 12, 105324) If the Bombay Meeting, during and immediately after the fast week 2, that passed the resolution was representative of Hindu India, it is up to every Hindu to make good that resolution in its fulness.
('59', 59, 3, 13, 105524) That resolution, as you know, has definite reference to temple entry.
('59', 59, 3, 14, 105594) It prescribes no conditions.
('59', 59, 3, 15, 105623) The whole trend of the resolution is that temple entry and the use of public institutions by Harijans on the same terms as the other Hindus is a debt long overdue by caste Hindus.
('59', 59, 3, 16, 105803) I feel that it would be wrong, if not a manifest breach of faith, to import any conditions specially applicable to Harijans.
('59', 59, 3, 17, 105928) Naturally, Harijans would be expected to conform to the conditions that are implied in Hinduism and have to be observed by everyone who enters temples.
('59', 59, 3, 18, 106080) But that is a different thing from laying down special conditions to be observed by Harijans by way of penance.
('59', 59, 3, 19, 106192) Most of the things that are included in your suggestions can be enunciated in a different and perfectly harmless manner, that is to say, by saying that it is the right of Harijans to enter all public temples under the same conditions that are applicable to all Hindus, irrespective of their caste or status, that is to say, (here may be described these general

('59', 60, 1, 3, 106959) From all the discussions that I had with the Shastris who favour the present movement and who are hostile to it, I have gathered that there is no warrant whatsoever for untouchability as we now know it.
('59', 60, 1, 4, 107162) There is perfect confusion as to whom, of all the people classified as untouchables in the census books, the verses oft quoted apply.
('59', 60, 1, 5, 107296) Untouchability by birth seems to be utterly non existent.
('59', 60, 1, 6, 107354) There is no proof whatsoever to show that any single one of the untouchables so classed is the progeny of a Brahmin woman through a Shudra man or that he is a descendant of such a union.
('59', 60, 1, 7, 107541) I would, therefore, beg of you not to surrender on the matter of principle.
('59', 60, 1, 8, 107617) I would far rather that the reformers were left to plough the lonely furrow than that they should be called upon to lend themselves to an unworthy surrender.
('59', 60, 1, 9, 107775) The surrender, in my opinion, of the highest type I have suggested in my compromise proposal, where the most delicate susceptibilities of a minority, however small it may be, have been taken into consideration.
('59', 60, 1, 10, 107986) Even that has cost me much criticism, but I am unaffected by it, because, in my opinion, it is perfectly honourable and satisfies all sincere and religious minded reformers and dissenters.
('59', 60, 1, 11, 108175) If I am obscure, you will, I know and hope, use the wire freely.
('59', 60, 1, 12, 108240) I am most anxious that God may make you the instrument of purifying Hinduism and keeping faith with the Harijans.

('59', 61, 8, 18, 109902) If it is, what form does the security take?
('59', 61, 8, 19, 109946) Besides the names of the printer and the publisher, is it necessary to announce the name of the editor, and if it is, is he to file a declaration?
('59', 61, 8, 20, 110093) In the estimate before me, the cost of wrappers has not been given.

('59', 62, 3, 5, 110650) I am not so enthusiastic as you are.
('59', 62, 3, 6, 110687) Let’s however wait, watch and pray.

('59', 62, 7, 10, 110804) January 20, 1933
('59', 62, 8, 11, 110821) DEAR RAMANAND BABOO1, This letter is not for publication.
('59', 62, 8, 12, 110879) This sudden opposition in Bengal against the Yeravda Pact comes upon me as a painful surprise.
('59', 62, 8, 13, 110974) The Secretary of the British Indian Association has sent me the text of the Resolution in which, among other things, an appeal is made to me to assist in revising the Pact in so far as Bengal is concerned.
('59', 62, 8, 14, 111180) 2 I have refrained from taking any part in the public discussion of the question, because I do not want to make confusion worse confounded, or to give an opinion on a matter on which I am not sufficiently informed.
('59', 62, 8, 15, 111395) I therefore seek your assistance and guidance in enabling me to form a judgement.
('59', 62, 8, 16, 111477) Two Harijan friends from Bengal, dreading that I might weaken, have asked me what I think about the opposition, and I have told them that I have not altered my opinion and that the Pact could not be changed without the unanimous consent of all the parties concerned.
('59', 62, 8, 17, 111744) My own position is that Harijans cannot be given too much by caste Hindus.
('59', 62, 8, 18, 111819) It is my confirmed opinion that if all the seats available to Hindus were taken by Harijans and other depressed classes, the so called superior castes will not only lose nothing, but will gain by the sacrifice, if such it may be called.
('59', 62, 8, 19, 112056) Taking this into consideration, please tell me whether you share the views of the opposition, and if you do, on what grounds, and why

('59', 63, 1, 2, 112312) those grounds were not at least urged at the Conference in Bombay by any one of the Bengal representatives.
('59', 63, 1, 3, 112420) You hardly need my assurance that I would be grateful to you for your frank opinion, even though it may be against the Pact.
('59', 63, 1, 4, 112545) I have no other end in life to serve but that of truth.
('59', 63, 1, 5, 112601) It is therefore never too late for me to mend an error, of which the conviction has gone home to me.

('59', 63, 6, 10, 112791) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter of 17th instant.
('59', 63, 6, 11, 112840) I never had your letter regarding Sjt.
('59', 63, 6, 12, 112879) Vaidya’s letter nor Mr. Seymer Stone’s.
('59', 63, 6, 13, 112919) If you have kept a copy, please let me have it, as also your explanation about Sjt.
('59', 63, 6, 14, 113003) Vaidya.
('59', 63, 6, 15, 113011) It is a most difficult thing for me to spare you one hour just now.
('59', 63, 6, 16, 113079) You should first reduce to writing exactly what your formula 1 is.
('59', 63, 6, 17, 113146) It does not matter whether your English is good or bad.
('59', 63, 6, 18, 113202) You may even write to me in Marathi.
('59', 63, 6, 19, 113239) I shall have no difficulty in following it, if the writing is legible.

('59', 63, 11, 24, 113404) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter.
('59', 63, 11, 25, 113446) You have started with an error and ended with an error.
('59', 63, 11, 26, 113502) I have gathered round me no one but God.
('59', 63, 11, 27, 113543) I would like you to name those whom you have in mind.
('59', 63, 11, 28, 113597) Who do you think could be with me fifty years ago, when the truth first dawned on me that untouchability as practised today is a sin, and do you know

('59', 64, 1, 2, 113920) that at that age I was forlorn unlike all the other school boys?
('59', 64, 1, 3, 113985) What authority have you to say that 90% caste Hindus are against temple entry, and supposing that they are, and supposing further that they are actually in error, why should it be suicidal for me to fight that error even though I was alone?
('59', 64, 1, 4, 114226) The untouchability question was taken up by the Congress in 1920 as an integral part of its programme.
('59', 64, 1, 5, 114329) I have no knowledge that from that day onward the Congress began to dwindle down in popular favour.
('59', 64, 1, 6, 114429) I claim to know something of the saints of Maharashtra whom you have named.
('59', 64, 1, 7, 114505) They have taught me a lesson quite different from the one you have learnt.
('59', 64, 1, 8, 114580) This is no new experience.
('59', 64, 1, 9, 114607) People learn from the Gods not what the latter would teach them but what they want to learn.
('59', 64, 1, 10, 114700) If you are really an admirer of my work, you will at least do me the favour of studying what I am doing before judging me, and if you will do so, you will soon discover that I am out not to destroy varnashramadharma, but to destroy the excess of it which is the present day untouchability, so that varnashramadharma may be revived in all its purity.

('59', 65, 3, 4, 115209) DEAR MR. JAYAKAR, From all the accounts that I have received, I understand that you have returned this time with very great benefit to your health.
('59', 65, 3, 5, 115357) I hope that the news I have received is quite correct.
('59', 65, 3, 6, 115412) The purpose, however, of writing to you is to ask you to guide me in the matter of the all India Bill about untouchability.
('59', 65, 3, 7, 115536) I hope you have read my statement on it.
('59', 65, 3, 8, 115577) I would appreciate your opinion about it.
('59', 65, 3, 9, 115619) What I would like you specially to apply your mind to are the following points: 1. Is the Bill itself good for the purpose intended?
('59', 65, 3, 10, 115752) 2. Is my argument about it correct?
('59', 65, 3, 11, 115788) 3. What are the prospects of its passing?
('59', 65, 3, 12, 115830) 4. Supposing that the opinion outside the Assembly is overwhelmingly in its favour, what should be done to ensure its safe passage through the Assembly?
('59', 65, 3, 13, 115983) If in this matter you think that you should discuss the whole question with me before you can usefully guide me, and if you can spare the time, do please come.
('59', 65, 3, 14, 116143) You perhaps know that in this matter you do not need to ask for any permission.

('59', 65, 8, 19, 116315) KAKA, I got your two letters.
('59', 65, 8, 20, 116345) I had been waiting to hear from you.
('59', 65, 8, 21, 116382) Complete the dental treatment.
('59', 65, 8, 22, 116413) I am glad that you try to reassure me regarding Prabhudas.
('59', 65, 8, 23, 116472) In fact I do wish my mind to be at rest in the matter.
('59', 65, 8, 24, 116527) What is the doctor’s explanation about the regular bleeding from the gums?
('59', 65, 8, 25, 116602) or is it that a dentist cannot know that?
('59', 65, 8, 26, 116644) Ask Talwalkar or Kanuga if they can explain.
('59', 65, 8, 27, 116689) I saw Rohit.

('59', 66, 1, 5, 117031) We had a full discussion on the subject of cooked food and I had expressed my firm opinion that this was not at all a suitable time to raise the issue.
('59', 66, 1, 6, 117183) Nobody has so far considered it to be a stumbling block nor is there any proposal that Harijans should make food offerings at all in the temples.
('59', 66, 1, 7, 117329) Your suggestions can be implemented when the issue is raised.

('59', 67, 3, 7, 118543) Is he careful in his work?
('59', 67, 3, 8, 118570) If he has the necessary qualities, it should not be difficult to find suitable work for him.
('59', 67, 3, 9, 118663) I hope you remember about the leather for repairing soles of sandals.
('59', 67, 3, 10, 118733) I don’t need it immediately, of course.
('59', 67, 3, 11, 118773) Send it with somebody who may be coming this way.
('59', 67, 3, 12, 118823) I suppose you have ascertained Radha’s wish.

('59', 68, 3, 4, 119841) MY DEAR RANGASWAMI, I have your letter.
('59', 68, 3, 5, 119881) You have made all the amends that it was possible for you to make.
('59', 68, 3, 6, 119948) 1 From Salivati’s letter of yesterday received by me I thought that he had done likewise, but now I see that the fault seems to have been entirely his.
('59', 68, 3, 7, 120100) His motives was no doubt good, but his judgement wholly bad, but before I can give my final opinion, I would like you to send me his despatch as it was received by you.
('59', 68, 3, 8, 120269) In his letter of yesterday, which I enclose herewith, as you can see he protests innocence and if his despatch was as he describes it to be, I fancy that he stands exonerated.
('59', 68, 3, 9, 120445) So far as my own memory is concerned, it is not at all at fault, and Mahadev, who is ever vigilant, and aspires to be another Boswell, has notes of my conversation 2 with Salivati which confirm me and in no way support him if he reported me as he appears to have done according to The Hindu of the 16th.
('59', 68, 3, 10, 120749) The unfortunate report came at such an awkward time when the slightest error on my part could have undone a structure that is being built up with patient toil and most delicate care.
('59', 68, 3, 11, 120932) Happily, the A. P. interview 3 I really gave most reluctantly, both out of my regard for you and solicitude for Salivati, and your prompt publication of my telegram averted what might have proved a dangerous situation.
('59', 68, 3, 12, 121151) The only reason now for my pursuing the subject is in order that no injustice may be done to Salivati.

('59', 70, 2, 3, 123589) January 21, 1933
('59', 70, 3, 4, 123606) MY DEAR SADASHIVA RAO,
('59', 70, 4, 5, 123629) I have your letter of 13th instant written on the train.
('59', 70, 4, 6, 123686) Untruthful propaganda and abuse are the lot generally of all reformers.
('59', 70, 4, 7, 123758) Why should we be any exception to the general rule?
('59', 70, 4, 8, 123810) Those who can stand such abuse and will not retaliate by matching two untruths against one have not only nothing to fear but will actually gain in strength through such unscrupulous opposition.
('59', 70, 4, 9, 124004) Therefore, so long as consciousness of the correctness of the campaign and the purity of the means employed in conducting it continue, we may not become agitated in any shape or form over such opposition.
('59', 70, 4, 10, 124209) But we may be sure of thriving on it.
('59', 70, 4, 11, 124247) And when we have positive consciousness of the truth in us and the strength derived from it, we need never be afraid of being charged with weakness.
('59', 70, 4, 12, 124396) He who for fear of appearing weak hesitates to say or do the right thing becomes untruthful in the very act, and therefore it may be said of him that he never had consciousness of the truth in him.
('59', 70, 5, 13, 124594) I read through the questions you left with me.
('59', 70, 5, 14, 124641) I have not dealt with them because you will find that every one of the points is amply covered in the statements already made by me.
('59', 70, 5, 15, 124774) I wonder if you have seen my letter 1 to the Editor of the Justice published on the day of its expiry.
('59', 70, 6, 16, 124877) There now remains your question about the conduct of Congressmen in connection with the provincial and district branches of the Servants of Untouchables Society.
('59', 70, 6, 17, 125039) They should be identified with activities of these organizations only in so far as their services are wanted and no further, even though the work may appear to them to be languishing.
('59', 70, 6, 18, 125223) In a service that may take in the activity of as many true servants who will offer their services, one need not belong to or work through an organization.
('59', 70, 6, 19, 125378) Even a cup of water lovingly handed to a Harijan, giving or procuring medical aid for an ailing Harijan, giving shelter to a shelterless Harijan, and innumerable such individual

('59', 71, 12, 17, 126114) I have your letter.
('59', 71, 12, 18, 126134) In my opinion, khaddar has virtues which nothing else has.
('59', 71, 12, 19, 126193) Khaddar means help to the most needy, and amongst them are to be counted thousands of Harijans, for their women eke out a living by spinning and several thousands of Harijans are weavers of nothing but khaddar.

('59', 72, 2, 3, 126600) January 21, 1933
('59', 72, 3, 4, 126617) MY DEAR THAKKAR BAPA, Your letter of the 18th instant surprises me.
('59', 72, 3, 5, 126685) I never asked the Bombay Board 1 to make an advance payment of Rs. 500 on account of the Central Board, but I asked them, if they would, to pay Rs. 500 to Poona on account of the expenses that Poona had to incur because of my activities being directed from Poona.
('59', 72, 3, 6, 126949) If I had intended the Central Board to pay, I would have approached the Central Board myself without the slightest hesitation.
('59', 72, 3, 7, 127076) I asked the Bombay Board because of its being well able to bear these expenses, Poona being next door to it.
('59', 72, 3, 8, 127185) You need not therefore refund the amount asked of you, but refer them to me.
('59', 72, 3, 9, 127262) As for the 5000 copies of my statements 2, I am not aware that I asked them to print them.
('59', 72, 3, 10, 127353) There certainly was some conversation about a reprint of my statements in pamphlet form, but I cannot now recall whether I talked about it to Seth Mathuradass, or Sjt.
('59', 72, 3, 11, 127521) J. K. Mehta, or Pyarelal or Chandrashankar.
('59', 72, 3, 12, 127565) As a matter of fact, I warned them against incurring the expense, as I had the impression that the Ajmer people were reprinting them and therefore asked them to enquire before embarking upon this expense.
('59', 72, 3, 13, 127770) But there never was the slightest intention on my part that the Central Board should be called upon to bear these expenses, and my own opinion is, as it always has been, that propaganda work should be more or less self supporting.
('59', 72, 3, 14, 128001) Therefore, I should consider it bad management if the sale of 5000 copies of my statements did not cover even the printing expenses.
('59', 72, 3, 15, 128134) You should refer the Bombay Board to me about this item also.
('59', 72, 3, 16, 128196) G. K. Devdhar’s letter to you is quite in order.
('59', 72, 3, 17, 128245) When Haribhau asked me about the matter I agreed with him and he was the bearer of G. K. Devdhar’s message that they should have Rs. 500 over and above the grant they would receive from the C:entral Board, and I told him to tell Devdhar that I would endeavour to secure that amount either from the Central Board or the Bombay Board.
('59', 72, 3, 18, 128578) But I first chose to write to the Bombay Board for the reason I have already stated, and

('59', 73, 1, 2, 128783) I was glad that promptly and without demur they sent a cheque for Rs. 500. Had they told me that it was on account of the Central Board, I would have asked Haribhau to return the cheque.
('59', 73, 1, 3, 128970) I am sending a copy of this letter to the Bombay Board for their information.
('59', 73, 1, 4, 129048) I am sending you a copy of my letter to the Bombay Board.

('59', 73, 6, 10, 129306) How did you gain the impression that I had authorized you to debit the Central Board with the two items referred to in my letter?
('59', 73, 6, 11, 129436) If I had so intended, according to my wont, I would have made it quite clear to you.
('59', 73, 6, 12, 129521) Indeed, I would have approached the Central Board myself for sanction, as I have done about various matters.

('59', 73, 11, 17, 129720) MY DEAR GHANSHYAMDAS, I have your letter.
('59', 73, 11, 18, 129762) I do not want you to come out with any public statement on the Bengal question, as you have noticed I am not making any public statement myself, and I have anticipated you by copying you, that is, writing to Dr. Bidhan and Ramanand Baboo.
('59', 73, 11, 19, 130001) I am not writing to Sjt.
('59', 73, 11, 20, 130026) J. C. Gupta, nor is it necessary for me to do so.
('59', 73, 11, 21, 130076) I might have met him, but I cannot say that I am even acquainted with him.

('59', 74, 1, 3, 130312) You can do one or the other thing, either issue a revised pamphlet suppressing the old copies, or paste the full resolution onto the imperfect resolution in the existing copies, and send a public circular to the effect that by an oversight an incomplete resolution was printed in the pamphlet, giving the corrected full text.
('59', 74, 1, 4, 130638) I quite understand that you have to look after your own business also, with more concentration today than before.
('59', 74, 1, 5, 130752) What is the hitch in getting Harijan Sevak out?
('59', 74, 1, 6, 130800) The news about your health is disturbing.
('59', 74, 1, 7, 130842) Why not have the necessary operation, if a reliable doctor advises it?
('59', 74, 1, 8, 130913) I have learnt by experience that even dietetics and fasts have their limitations.
('59', 74, 1, 9, 130995) They do not always answer.
('59', 74, 1, 10, 131022) And whatever rest is necessary, you ought to impose on yourself.
('59', 74, 1, 11, 131087) Dilatoriness in these matters should be regarded as sinful.

('59', 74, 5, 17, 131325) Your handwriting seems to be getting worse and worse.
('59', 74, 5, 18, 131379) That will never do.
('59', 74, 5, 19, 131399) Even from her sick bed, whenever Radha writes a letter she writes it in beautiful handwriting which looks like printed type.
('59', 74, 5, 20, 131524) Surely you are not incapable of writing like that?
('59', 74, 5, 21, 131575) As for the contents of the letter, though none of us could observe it Chhaganlal discovered that you had tried this time to introduce some colour in it, but the colour was so faint that six out of eight eyes could not observe it.
('59', 74, 5, 22, 131805) As he is taking down this letter, Mahadev tells me that he also had observed it.
('59', 74, 5, 23, 131886) You may get out of this what comfort you wish to.
('59', 74, 5, 24, 131936) You should know from this with what attention even a letter of ten lines from you is being read here.

('59', 75, 3, 10, 132563) It is rather long.

('59', 75, 3, 13, 132719) Calm him down a little if you can.
('59', 75, 3, 14, 132754) I can’t believe that Mathuradas would tell a lie.
('59', 75, 3, 15, 132804) We ought not to get angry with him for writing what he has done, but should learn from it whatever may be worth learning.

('59', 76, 3, 14, 134246) Should it not be published by the Gujarat Mandal?
('59', 76, 3, 15, 134296) Anyway, consider and do what is proper.

('59', 76, 8, 21, 134562) January 21, 1933
('59', 76, 9, 22, 134579) Referring to the Delhi message published this morning, in which probable difficulties in the way of the Government according sanction to the Temple entry Bills were anticipated, Gandhiji observed: If the report is an intelligent anticipation of the forthcoming Viceregal decision I can only say it will be a tragedy.
('59', 76, 9, 23, 134896) I emphatically repudiate the suggestion that there is any political objective behind these measures.
('59', 76, 9, 24, 134997) If court decisions had not hardened a doubtful custom into law, no legislation would probably be required.
('59', 76, 9, 25, 135104) I would
('59', 77, 0, 1, 135112) 78 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 77, 1, 2, 135153) myself regard State interference in religious matters as an intolerable nuisance.
('59', 77, 1, 3, 135235) But, here, legislation becomes an imperative necessity in order to remove the legal obstruction and, based as it will be on popular will so far as I can see, there can be no question of a clash between parties representing rival opinions.
('59', 77, 1, 4, 135474) It has been suggested that one of the reasons for withholding sanction is likely to be that there has been no demand on the part of Harijans for legislation to remove their social disabilities.
('59', 77, 1, 5, 135668) But, I do know that Dr. Ambedkar’s memorandum bristles with suggestions for legislation regarding all sorts of social disabilities.
('59', 77, 1, 6, 135800) Yet, I hope nobody wants a hurricane agitation on behalf of Harijans before the social and religious yoke is removed from off their necks.
('59', 77, 1, 7, 135939) Furthermore, I make bold to claim, if there has not been a loud demand by Harijans for temple entry, I am responsible for it, because I have been advising them not to enter the agitation on a large scale, whilst caste Hindus are themselves making Herculean efforts to implement the Bombay Resolution of September last, which pledges caste Hindus to opening public temples, among other things, to Harijans.
('59', 77, 1, 8, 136345) In conclusion, I would only repeat that the refusal to sanction the introduction of a measure demanded by caste Hindu opinion would obstruct the progress of reform, whose advisability no lover of religious freedom has questioned.
('59', 77, 2, 9, 136575) Mr. Gandhi has declined to comment on the suggestion that the Government
('59', 77, 3, 10, 136648) might decide in favour of a single Central legislation, saying that he would like to
('59', 77, 4, 11, 136733) have more details regarding this proposal.

('59', 78, 1, 4, 137583) I understand that you also wish that this marriage should take place soon.
('59', 78, 1, 5, 137658) Please help me.
('59', 78, 1, 6, 137674) Leave me out of this, and do what you think is for their good.
('59', 78, 1, 7, 137737) If you had not asked me about the matter and if Maganlal 3 had not written to me about it I would have had no occasion at all to give advice.
('59', 78, 1, 8, 137879) What right had I to give any?
('59', 78, 1, 9, 137909) When all of you seek my advice, looking upon me as your well wisher, I think it my duty to give whatever advice may seem right to me.
('59', 78, 1, 10, 138043) I know the limits of one’s relations with persons with whom one has no blood relation.

('59', 78, 12, 22, 138606) NARANDAS, I can’t understand how you received on the same day the letters handed over by me on different days.
('59', 78, 12, 23, 138717) I will inquire of the authorities.

('59', 79, 1, 3, 139105) If you let me know every time these dates as you have done this time, I can ask the authorities here to be more alert.
('59', 79, 1, 4, 139224) I got [today] the letters posted by you on the 20th.
('59', 79, 1, 5, 139277) The letters posted on the 19th were received yesterday.
('59', 79, 1, 6, 139333) I am convinced that we shall gain nothing from Krishnamaiy adevi’s connection with the Ashram.
('59', 79, 1, 7, 139428) If it seems proper to you, you may fix a monthly allowance to be paid to her for some time.
('59', 79, 1, 8, 139520) During that period, Mahavir should secure a job.
('59', 79, 1, 9, 139569) The mother and the daughters also should work.
('59', 79, 1, 10, 139616) I would have no objection to their being paid Rs. 50 a month for four months plus railway fare from Ahmedabad to the place where they decide to go and live.
('59', 79, 1, 11, 139773) These are my personal views.
('59', 79, 1, 12, 139802) If, however, all of you there have discussed the matter and come to some other decision, you should abide by it and implement it.
('59', 79, 1, 13, 139932) I still advise you to write to the persons who have lent them money.
('59', 79, 1, 14, 140001) We shall thereby know, we ought to know, what the facts are.
('59', 79, 1, 15, 140062) You may derive what consolation you can from the fact that .
('59', 79, 1, 16, 140123) 1 has harassed me more than he has done you.
('59', 79, 1, 17, 140168) And he has crossed all bounds in his behaviour to me this time.
('59', 79, 1, 18, 140232) All the same, we should go on doing our duty by him.
('59', 79, 1, 19, 140285) I may even have made a mistake in permitting him to join the Ashram.
('59', 79, 1, 20, 140354) I also doubt whether he really suffers from tuberculosis.
('59', 79, 1, 21, 140412) However, I never regret such mistakes.
('59', 79, 1, 22, 140451) Anybody who tries to follow ahimsa is bound to commit them.
('59', 79, 1, 23, 140511) How can we judge a man’s worth?
('59', 79, 1, 24, 140543) Does he live in the Ashram now?
('59', 79, 1, 25, 140575) I hope Indira has recovered.
('59', 79, 1, 26, 140604) How does Ramnik behave?
('59', 79, 1, 27, 140628) If Bhikhabhai lives in the Ashram, does he take his meals at home or in the Ashram kitchen?
('59', 79, 1, 28, 140720) As for the land cess to be paid by the Ashram, you may do what you think right.
('59', 79, 1, 29, 140800) I am writing to Mama about khadi.
('59', 79, 1, 30, 140834) 2 I have more of it here than I need.
('59', 79, 1, 31, 140872) There is no harm in Amtussalaam going to Delhi.
('59', 79, 1, 32, 140920) She has faith in Dr. Sharma and the latter is confident.
('59', 79, 1, 33, 140977) Just now the weather in Delhi will also be lovely.
('59', 79, 1, 34, 141028) She seems to be very eager to come and see me.
('59', 79, 1, 35, 141075) Do what you think right about that.

('59', 80, 1, 2, 141231) I got Prema’s letter.
('59', 80, 1, 3, 141253) I, therefore, don’t write about the matter here.

('59', 80, 5, 8, 141501) January 22, 1933
('59', 80, 6, 9, 141518) PREMA, I was relieved to get your letter.
('59', 80, 6, 10, 141560) Even worry is a child of imagination.
('59', 80, 6, 11, 141598) Why should I worry if I do not get a letter from you, and why should I feel relieved on getting one?
('59', 80, 6, 12, 141699) If you ask me this question, I would not be able to reply to it, or would only say: ‘‘This is what ignorant attachment means.” A foolish letter from you would not upset me.
('59', 80, 6, 13, 141872) If, however, I see your error or shortcoming and do not point it out to you, I would not be doing my duty as your well wisher, co worker, friend or father.
('59', 80, 6, 14, 142028) What I find strange is that you should get angry with me and sulk for telling you something with a sincere motive, instead of thanking me for it.
('59', 80, 6, 15, 142174) Should we not thank a person for telling us frankly what he feels?
('59', 80, 6, 16, 142241) I learnt this in my very childhood.
('59', 80, 6, 17, 142277) I do want you to learn it from me.
('59', 80, 6, 18, 142312) If my understanding of a situation is wrong, I deserve to be pitied, and, if it is correct, I would be doing you good.
('59', 80, 6, 19, 142431) In either case, you gain something, in that you come to know better the person with whom you have thrown in your lot.
('59', 80, 6, 20, 142549) I want that all of you should know my shortcomings and deficiencies and it is always my effort to show them myself.
('59', 80, 6, 21, 142665) I don’t wish to hide even my thoughts.
('59', 80, 6, 22, 142704) I would even write them down if I had the necessary gift.
('59', 80, 6, 23, 142762) But I know I cannot do that.
('59', 80, 6, 24, 142791) I don’t think there can be any power in the world which can penetrate all the secrets of thought.
('59', 80, 6, 25, 142889) Probably we shall be able to know them if somebody invents a machine to reveal them.
('59', 80, 6, 26, 142974) Even while I was writing these few sentences, my imagination traversed the universe many times over.
('59', 80, 6, 27, 143075) You will admit that everybody cannot understand whether or not he has the poison in his heart.
('59', 80, 6, 28, 143170) Because one does not consciously wish to nurse hatred, it does not mean that there is no hatred in one’s heart.
('59', 81, 0, 1, 143282) 82 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 81, 1, 2, 143323) It takes hold of us against our will.
('59', 81, 1, 3, 143361) You will probably not admit that anybody whose heart is full of anger is also full of hatred.
('59', 81, 1, 4, 143455) If you do not, then the word ‘‘poison” does not have the same meaning for you and me.
('59', 81, 1, 5, 143541) I remember that Ba often charged me with having poison in my heart.
('59', 81, 1, 6, 143609) How can I deny that charge?
('59', 81, 1, 7, 143637) I may not have believed that there was any poison in my words.
('59', 81, 1, 8, 143700) But that is beside the point.
('59', 81, 1, 9, 143730) What should matter to me is that she felt the poison.
('59', 81, 1, 10, 143784) Words which are perfectly truthful and spoken with perfect love will never hurt anybody.
('59', 81, 1, 11, 143873) They may sometimes hurt one in the beginning, but such a person himself will afterwards admit their beneficial effect on him.
('59', 81, 1, 12, 143999) I should like you not to be your own judge in all matters.
('59', 81, 1, 13, 144058) It is possible that others judge you better than you do yourself.
('59', 81, 1, 14, 144124) I will now end this tale of “poison”.
('59', 81, 1, 15, 144162) The question of your leaving the Ashram does not arise just now.
('59', 81, 1, 16, 144227) It will arise only after I am released and return to the Ashram to stay there.
('59', 81, 1, 17, 144306) That is how I read your letter.
('59', 81, 1, 18, 144338) Morally speaking, it can arise only then, if at all, for, so long as I cannot return to the Ashram to stay in it, in the eyes of the inmates of the Ashram I will remain a prisoner.
('59', 81, 1, 19, 144519) All of you who decided to stay on when I bade good bye to the Ashram bound yourselves thereby to remain there till I returned.
('59', 81, 1, 20, 144646) If I am right in believing this, it is a waste of time and energy to think now what should be done when I return to stay there.
('59', 81, 1, 21, 144774) The news you have given about happenings in the Ashram is very useful to me.
('59', 81, 1, 22, 144851) You should discuss the problem of Lakshmi with Narandas, and if both of you decide that she should be married, it should be done soon.
('59', 81, 1, 23, 144986) Her restlessness also is likely to be the result of an unconscious desire to get married.
('59', 81, 1, 24, 145076) She is now of marriageable age, and she does intend to marry.
('59', 81, 1, 25, 145138) The desire to wait till I am released should be regarded as nothing but ignorant attachment to me.
('59', 81, 1, 26, 145237) You should try and understand her heart properly, and not wait for her emphatic consent.
('59', 81, 1, 27, 145326) It seems to me desirable to take the advice of Lakshmibehn and Durgabehn in this matter.
('59', 81, 1, 28, 145415) They would understand the problem better than you can.
('59', 81, 1, 29, 145470) I understand from what you yourself have said that you have no experience of how a girl feels when she desires to marry.
('59', 81, 1, 30, 145591) In other words, you have never felt the desire to marry.
('59', 81, 1, 31, 145648) I also know some other unmarried women who have never felt it.
('59', 81, 1, 32, 145711) Some other women remain unmarried with an effort of will.
('59', 81, 1, 33, 145769) They know what marriage means.
('59', 81, 1, 34, 145800) What advice should I give you about your health?
('59', 81, 1, 35, 145849) Ghee seems

('59', 82, 1, 2, 145904) to be absolutely necessary for it.
('59', 82, 1, 3, 145939) Whenever you leave the Ashram, your weight increases, and as soon as you return to the Ashram you lose the weight you had gained.
('59', 82, 1, 4, 146069) You must get over this weakness.
('59', 82, 1, 5, 146102) How it can be done, you alone know.
('59', 82, 1, 6, 146138) I hope you experience no difficulty now in speaking.
('59', 82, 1, 7, 146191) I don’t wish to catch anybody in my snare.
('59', 82, 1, 8, 146234) What would be my plight if all people became my slaves?
('59', 82, 1, 9, 146290) And, moreover, I am sure that any such effort would be doomed to failure.
('59', 82, 1, 10, 146364) Even if it is true that I try to catch people in my snare, why should you lose confidence in yourself for that reason?
('59', 82, 1, 11, 146483) Your letters are sufficient evidence that you are vigilant and not likely to succumb.
('59', 82, 1, 12, 146569) It does seem, however, that you are perpetually afraid that you will let yourself be caught.
('59', 82, 1, 13, 146662) That is a bad sign.
('59', 82, 1, 14, 146682) Having resolved that you will not let yourself be caught, why should you feel afraid?
('59', 82, 1, 15, 146768) But may it also not be possible that you and I do not mean the same thing by ‘‘getting caught”?

('59', 82, 5, 18, 146944) January 22, 1933
('59', 82, 6, 19, 146961) BHAGWANJI, Chit and chitta are two different words, but the latter is derived from the former.
('59', 82, 6, 20, 147056) Chit means consciousness, or it can be interpreted to mean that which can have consciousness, namely, the atman.
('59', 82, 6, 21, 147169) To say that the chitta of one who has overcome attachment is always serene and contented means that his atman is so.
('59', 82, 6, 22, 147286) Chitta may also mean the mind.
('59', 82, 6, 23, 147317) The word should be interpreted according to the context in the sentence or the verse in which it occurs.
('59', 82, 6, 24, 147422) In trying to explain the meaning of dhyanayoga, one frequently has to use the word yoga.
('59', 82, 6, 25, 147511) It should be remembered when doing so that yoga means skill in work or action done without attachment.

('59', 83, 14, 21, 148655) The verse from Kabir also is appropriate.
('59', 83, 14, 22, 148697) Still, there is some incompleteness in your evaluation, but it is not a serious defect.
('59', 83, 14, 23, 148785) Only, one would expect more from you.
('59', 83, 14, 24, 148823) I have no doubt that you have given what you could.

('59', 84, 7, 12, 149624) Did you behave politely and courteously there?

('59', 84, 12, 20, 150229) This knowledge calms down our passions.
('59', 84, 12, 21, 150269) Hence, I would say that khadi, when worn with such awareness, helps brahmacharya.
('59', 84, 12, 22, 150351) Do you get the point?

('59', 85, 8, 9, 150827) It would be a crime not to send you to Delhi even after receiving Dr. Sharma’s letter.
('59', 85, 8, 10, 150914) So you may proceed direct for Delhi but see me on the way to the Ashram on your return.
('59', 85, 8, 11, 151002) You must learn to some extent the value of remaining quiet.
('59', 85, 8, 12, 151062) And remember that we profess to be poor.
('59', 85, 8, 13, 151103) The poor remain content by meeting their companions and relatives in the spirit only.
('59', 85, 8, 14, 151189) Who would provide them railway fare?
('59', 85, 8, 15, 151226) Anyway, go to Delhi immediately, get well and visit me on return.
('59', 85, 8, 16, 151292) God will keep you safe.
('59', 85, 8, 17, 151316) Keep writing to me.

('59', 86, 8, 8, 151828) January 23, 1933
('59', 86, 9, 9, 151845) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter enclosing a copy of the resolution of your Union.
('59', 86, 9, 10, 151936) I note what the resolution says about a distinct name.
('59', 86, 9, 11, 151991) A name is inevitable till there is a complete fusion.
('59', 86, 9, 12, 152045) The only question therefore is what name to distinguish the so called untouchables by; and ‘Harijans’ was the name suggested by some of them, and as it was a name that exactly fitted the condition, I adopted it; for, those who are forsaken by mankind become the chosen of God, and ‘Harijan’ literally means that.
('59', 86, 9, 13, 152358) I hope that this resolution by your Union is not the end of the service to the cause, but merely a beginning and an earnest of solid and constructive service yet to come.
('59', 86, 10, 14, 152529) Yours sincerely, THE VICE PRESIDENT PUNJAB PROVINCIAL STUDENTS’ UNION LAHORE

('59', 87, 3, 7, 153128) You may make it in your way, but that way should be such that the progress made by others will seem insignificant in comparison.
('59', 87, 3, 8, 153257) If you decide, I am sure you will be able to do much.
('59', 87, 3, 9, 153311) Do try.

('59', 87, 9, 19, 153730) Each letter in a word should be distinct.
('59', 87, 9, 20, 153772) It is Ba’s love which makes her write that she would like you to stay with her.

('59', 88, 9, 12, 154692) You have said that you accept everything else except opening of temples to Harijans.
('59', 88, 9, 13, 154777) You may leave me to strive for the cause of temple entry, but the other things you must do as a sacred duty.
('59', 88, 9, 14, 154886) If you help, we can soon make the Harijans give up eating carrion.
('59', 88, 9, 15, 154953) All schools, hospitals, wells, and so on should be thrown open completely.
('59', 88, 9, 16, 155028) You yourself have said that if the Harijans pray, bathe regularly and keep themselves clean, they will be as good as we are.
('59', 88, 9, 17, 155153) You should help in making them do all that.
('59', 88, 9, 18, 155197) You will then be welcome to abuse me as much as you wish to.

('59', 89, 3, 5, 155658) Perhaps you are afraid that the local subjects may be offended if the temple is thrown open, but what about the bham?
('59', 89, 3, 6, 155776) What are the arrangements for the disposal of carcasses?
('59', 89, 3, 7, 155833) Do you charge the Dheds for clearing them?
('59', 89, 3, 8, 155876) If you wish to stop them from partaking of carrion, you ought to pay them for their services and supervise the processing of carcasses.
('59', 89, 3, 9, 156012) This would involve some labour no doubt, but no loss.
('59', 89, 3, 10, 156066) How are they treated in courts, and in hospitals?

('59', 89, 8, 16, 156276) SUMANGAL, I have your letter after many weeks, nay, months.
('59', 89, 8, 17, 156336) It is only proper to utilize some time for improving your health.
('59', 89, 8, 18, 156402) I keep getting news of Kanta.
('59', 89, 8, 19, 156432) Saroop gives me news of her, as does Prabhavati.
('59', 89, 8, 20, 156481) I have no doubt she has been putting her time to good use.
('59', 89, 8, 21, 156540) If one gets food from outside after securing permission, for the sake of one’s health, one is doing nothing wrong.
('59', 89, 8, 22, 156655) But it is praiseworthy if one is content with whatever food one gets inside and refrains from asking for more.
('59', 89, 8, 23, 156766) But he who cannot maintain his health on the food he gets in prison, and has secured permission to obtain it from outside and can easily have it, yet does not do so and so spoils his health, is obstinate.
('59', 89, 8, 24, 156971) Perhaps he could be considered a literalist.

('59', 90, 1, 2, 157104) I certainly do not think there is any harm in having a shikha 1. It is a time honoured custom which the reformer may not try to change and so run into trouble.
('59', 90, 1, 3, 157264) You may not find a strong reason in support of every custom, yet if it is popular and there is nothing morally wrong in it, is deserves to be followed.
('59', 90, 2, 4, 157416) The statement that “a few medicines are found to be effective but they are well known” is not happily phrased.
('59', 90, 2, 5, 157527) The meaning can be made more explicit.
('59', 90, 2, 6, 157566) Although one may not repose one’s faith in allopathy, some allopathic medicines can certainly be used.
('59', 90, 2, 7, 157669) One does not have to go out and look for them.
('59', 90, 2, 8, 157716) They are well known household remedies such as castor oil, quinine, kariata, sonamukhi.
('59', 90, 2, 9, 157804) I have not come to any harm from fasting.
('59', 90, 2, 10, 157846) Fasting may be resorted to in old age.
('59', 90, 2, 11, 157885) Then, a fast undertaken from spiritual motives is not difficult to go through.
('59', 90, 2, 12, 157964) Of course one does become emaciated because there is not enough fat in the body.
('59', 90, 2, 13, 158045) You write in haste and therefore your letters are difficult to decipher.

('59', 92, 3, 4, 160275) BHAI SOMAVANSHI, I read your loving letter from beginning to end.
('59', 92, 3, 5, 160341) I have received the books 1 also.
('59', 92, 3, 6, 160375) I also listened to the life story of the Maharaj.
('59', 92, 3, 7, 160425) I have read almost all the marked portions of the book.
('59', 92, 3, 8, 160481) Both failed to impress me.
('59', 92, 3, 9, 160508) Chiefly because we find no basis for regarding the so called untouchables as untouchables; nor for the treatment meted out to them.
('59', 92, 3, 10, 160640) How am I at fault?
('59', 92, 3, 11, 160659) I have been saying for the last 45 years the very thing about the eradication of untouchability that I say now.
('59', 92, 3, 12, 160771) My views have been well known in India for more than 25 years.
('59', 92, 3, 13, 160834) Now and then some opposition was certainly heard but I incurred no one’s wrath.
('59', 92, 3, 14, 160914) Now that I am ready to do penance for it I am blamed.
('59', 92, 3, 15, 160968) But the Shastras and the saints have preached the necessity of tapascharya 2 whenever dharma dwindles and this is what I am attempting to do.
('59', 92, 3, 16, 161110) There is no headstrongness about it.
('59', 92, 3, 17, 161147) How can that man be headstrong who is ever prepared to correct his errors?
('59', 92, 3, 18, 161222) By pointing out the omission on the part of saints to lay stress on this particular problem you are doing them and me an injustice.
('59', 92, 3, 19, 161354) The saints do not try to remove all the evils, nor can they do so.
('59', 92, 3, 20, 161421) They simply disseminate dharma and in the process try to remove some evil.
('59', 92, 3, 21, 161496) Even the avatars are unable to destroy all evil; they perform their deeds concentrating on the chief evil of their times.
('59', 92, 3, 22, 161618) An important feature of the non violent spirit is that it always keeps the popular will in view.
('59', 92, 3, 23, 161715) The anti untouchability movement may also be taken as basically meant to test public will.
('59', 92, 3, 24, 161806) The highest religion is useless for those who are not prepared to live by it.
('59', 92, 3, 25, 161884) Compulsion has absolutely no place in the spirit of non violence.
('59', 92, 3, 26, 161950) You are correct in suggesting that I should offer daily prayers to God to show me the right path.
('59', 92, 3, 27, 162048) I not only constantly do that but believe that I take no action without His command; you may rest assured on this.

('59', 93, 3, 4, 162363) Observing silence implies abstaining from talking, gestures, food and drink, and closing one’s eyes and ears, i.e., remaining in seclusion and losing oneself in thought.
('59', 93, 3, 5, 162533) On the day of silence, one should remember God.
('59', 93, 3, 6, 162581) The purpose of silence is meditation.

('59', 93, 10, 19, 163079) DEAR DAUGHTER RAIHANA, I have your letter.
('59', 93, 10, 20, 163122) The meaning of tuk as given by you seems correct.
('59', 93, 10, 21, 163172) If I wait till I can write a good hand and commit not a single error, I shall never be able to write in Urdu.
('59', 93, 10, 22, 163282) If you send me by post some extra time along with the Urdu lessons, you will find no mistakes.
('59', 93, 10, 23, 163377) My respects to Father and Mother.
('59', 93, 10, 24, 163411) May I send a kiss for you?
('59', 93, 10, 25, 163438) But only on one condition; that you drive away the fever.
('59', 93, 10, 26, 163496) Why don’t you become perfectly well by taking a little more rest?
('59', 93, 10, 27, 163562) There are enough duties for you if you remain well.
('59', 93, 10, 28, 163614) There is no lack of jobs for those keen to serve.

('59', 94, 1, 2, 163768) 141. STATEMENT ON VICEROY’S DECISION
('59', 94, 2, 3, 163805) January 24, 1933
('59', 94, 3, 4, 163822) Having read the Government decision on the two Bills 1
('59', 94, 4, 5, 163877) about untouchability now before the country, I cannot help expressing my regret on general grounds that the Government could not see their way to allow both the Bills to be discussed by the respective Legislatures and the country.
('59', 94, 4, 6, 164108) Dr. Subbaroyan’s Bill restricts itself to one particular issue of temple entry and that too in the Madras Presidency, and the opening of each temple depends on the will of the majority of those entitled to temple entry.
('59', 94, 4, 7, 164328) It therefore reduces the possibility of a clash between one party and another party to a minimum and to a zero if the reformers play the game, i.e., allow for the religious scruples even of a microscopic minority as my compromise proposal does.
('59', 94, 4, 8, 164573) But this was not to be.
('59', 94, 4, 9, 164597) From a strict sanatanist point, the Madras Bill was perhaps the lesser of the two evils as they would put it.
('59', 94, 4, 10, 164707) It was easier for a reformer to cope with, and for me personally too as a fasting hostage, for Viceregal sanction would have in all probability successfully prevented a fast over Guruvayur.
('59', 94, 4, 11, 164897) But the Government of India had willed otherwise.
('59', 94, 4, 12, 164947) I must try to trace the hand of God in it.
('59', 94, 4, 13, 164990) He wants to try me through and through.
('59', 94, 4, 14, 165030) If He does, He will have to give me adequate strength as He has always vouchsafed those who would surrender themselves wholly to Him.
('59', 94, 4, 15, 165164) The all India Bill is short and sweet, being of negative character in one way.
('59', 94, 4, 16, 165243) It gives no direct aid to the reformer.
('59', 94, 4, 17, 165283) It merely refuses aid to any and every individual sanatanist who would come to seek assistance in the secular courts to impose his will on the whole Hindu society and to enforce a custom which the latter may consider to be repugnant to Hindu Shastras and the innate moral sense of man.
('59', 94, 4, 18, 165569) It abolishes legal untouchability, leaving the social and religious to its fate.
('59', 94, 4, 19, 165650) The sanction given to this Bill is an unintentional challenge to Hinduism and the reformer.
('59', 94, 4, 20, 165742) Hinduism will take care of itself if the reformer will be true to himself.
('59', 94, 4, 21, 165817) Thus considered, the Government of India’s decision must be regarded as a godsend.
('59', 94, 4, 22, 165900) It clears the issue.

('59', 95, 0, 1, 166074) 96 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 95, 1, 2, 166115) makes it easy for India and the world to understand the tremendous importance of the moral struggle now going on in India.
('59', 95, 1, 3, 166238) It takes it at one sweep to its natural platform to which it was timidly advancing.
('59', 95, 1, 4, 166322) As a life long reformer and fighter, I must take up the challenge in all humility, and so must every Hindu who was directly or indirectly a party to the resolution 1 adopted under the chairmanship of the revered Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya.
('59', 95, 1, 5, 166563) The resolution bears repetition:
('59', 95, 2, 6, 166596) This Conference resolves that henceforth, amongst Hindus, no one shall be regarded as ‘untouchable’ by reason of his birth, and that those who have been so regarded hitherto will have the same rights as other Hindus in regard to the use of public wells, public schools, public roads and all other public institutions.
('59', 95, 2, 7, 166914) These rights shall have statutory recognition at the first opportunity, and shall be one of the earliest Acts of the swaraj Parliament, if it shall not have received such recognition before that time.
('59', 95, 3, 8, 167115) It is further agreed that it shall be the duty of all Hindu leaders to secure,
('59', 95, 4, 9, 167194) by every legitimate and peaceful means, the early removal of all social
('59', 95, 5, 10, 167266) disabilities now imposed by custom upon the so called untouchable classes
('59', 95, 6, 11, 167340) including the bar in respect of admission into temples.
('59', 95, 6, 12, 167396) Let the reader carefully note the words printed in italics.
('59', 95, 6, 13, 167456) The resolution contemplates, if at all possible, the removal of legal untouchability even before the establishment of a swaraj Parliament.
('59', 95, 6, 14, 167595) The opportunity has now offered itself.
('59', 95, 6, 15, 167635) No Hindu who is jealous of the honour of Hinduism or the word given to Harijans dare let the opportunity slip.
('59', 95, 6, 16, 167746) Even the sanatanist, if he will read the all India Bill, as I do, may not resist it.
('59', 95, 6, 17, 167831) For, has he not said to me, has he not said it even in his writings, that he has no quarrel with political and civic rights being given to Harijans on the same terms as caste Hindus?
('59', 95, 6, 18, 168014) In other words, he has no objection to Harijans being treated as equals with the rest in the eye of the law.
('59', 95, 6, 19, 168123) If he is not, in the eye of religion, that is a matter for the sanatanist and his conscience.
('59', 95, 6, 20, 168217) The law’s assistance must not be summoned to aid him to enforce his conscience against a fellow being.
('59', 95, 6, 21, 168320) The sanatanist Shastris whom I had the pleasure of meeting had been able only to cite me verses to the effect that if anyone is polluted by the touch of an untouchable he has either to take a sip of water or

('59', 96, 1, 2, 168674) have a bath.
('59', 96, 1, 3, 168687) There seems to be nowhere mention of punishment for an untouchable entering a public place including a temple.
('59', 96, 1, 4, 168798) And, in no case, should the aid of secular law be summoned to punish an untouchable guilty of mere infringement of a sacerdotal rule.
('59', 96, 1, 5, 168932) The present Bill rightly renders such an interference by law impossible.
('59', 96, 1, 6, 169005) The opening of temples to Harijans would, under the Bill, be regulated by mutual adjustment.
('59', 96, 1, 7, 169098) Where the opinion of the temple going population is not ripe for reform, naturally the Harijans cannot enter the temples.
('59', 96, 1, 8, 169220) Where the opinion is ripe, the law cannot be invoked by individuals to thwart the will of the majority.
('59', 96, 1, 9, 169324) But whatever the sanatanists may decide, the movement for temple entry now broadens from Guruvayur in the extreme south to Hardwar in the north, and my fast, though it remains further postponed, depends not, now, upon Guruvayur only but extends automatically to temples in general.
('59', 96, 1, 10, 169606) That is to say, the fast becomes dependent upon the actions of reformers not regarding the Madras Bill which was to cover Guruvayur only, but regarding the all India Bill which covers all temples including Guruvayur.
('59', 96, 1, 11, 169823) And so it has been throughout my life.
('59', 96, 1, 12, 169862) One step has naturally led me on to another, even despite myself.
('59', 96, 1, 13, 169928) I was confining my attention to the Madras Bill.
('59', 96, 1, 14, 169977) It was enough for me.
('59', 96, 1, 15, 169999) Even on Saturday last, that is, the 21st January, when the Associated Press correspondent asked my opinion of the Associated Press Delhi correspondent’s forecast, I declined to commit myself to any opinion on the all India Bill as compared to the Madras Bill.
('59', 96, 1, 16, 170259) 1 I was not prepared to face a bigger and graver contingency.
('59', 96, 1, 17, 170321) But now that it comes upon me as an accomplished fact, I dare not flinch.
('59', 96, 1, 18, 170395) The Government pronouncement would have one to think that the Bill will be one long drawn out agony, and may never become the law of the land.
('59', 96, 1, 19, 170538) They are right, from their standpoint, in being over cautious.
('59', 96, 1, 20, 170601) But if Hindu conscience is really roused against untouchability, as the latter is practised today, the Bill can become law in no time.
('59', 96, 1, 21, 170736) The Government cannot resist the unequivocal expression of Hindu opinion in favour of it.
('59', 96, 1, 22, 170826) Despite sanatanist opposition, my belief is that a vast mass of Hindu opinion is against untouchability, though it may not take energetic steps to remove it.
('59', 96, 1, 23, 170984) It is that faith which sustains me.
('59', 96, 1, 24, 171020) No further ordinary propaganda will convince the
('59', 96, 2, 25, 171069) 1 Vide “Interview to Associated Press”, 21 1 1933
('59', 97, 0, 1, 171119) 98 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 97, 1, 2, 171160) Hindu mind of the sense of wrong of untouchability if it is not already convinced by years of work in that behalf.
('59', 97, 1, 3, 171275) It requires then, as it has done before now, the extraordinary propaganda of penance.
('59', 97, 1, 4, 171361) It may be that it needs the stimulus of a fast on the part of one who has made his life one with them.
('59', 97, 1, 5, 171464) If so, they shall have it.
('59', 97, 1, 6, 171491) They must either remove untouchability or remove me from their midst.
('59', 97, 1, 7, 171561) Let me proclaim it, for the thousandth time, that for me, as with my co workers, the removal of untouchability is an indispensable religious need and the opening of temples to Harijans, being a pure spiritual act, is an indispensable test of that removal.
('59', 97, 1, 8, 171817) It is the one thing that alone can give new life and new hope to Harijans, as no mere economic uplift can do.
('59', 97, 1, 9, 171927) Economic and all other uplift will follow temple entry as light follows dawn.
('59', 97, 1, 10, 172005) The one single act of opening temples to Harijans will purify Hinduism, and will open the hearts of both caste Hindus and Harijans to receive new light.
('59', 97, 1, 11, 172158) The message of the temples will penetrate every Harijan hut; the message of economic and educational uplift will touch only those to whom it is personally brought.
('59', 97, 1, 12, 172322) This proposition of mine can easily be understood by those who, like me, believe in temples as an integral part of Hinduism, as churches and mosques are of Christianity and Islam.
('59', 97, 1, 13, 172502) It is not necessary that every Harijan should at once enter the temples.
('59', 97, 1, 14, 172575) It is enough and necessary if he knows that he has acquired that right.
('59', 97, 1, 15, 172647) And in this religious conception of Hinduism fasts and the like take their natural and necessary place.
('59', 97, 1, 16, 172751) They are then, no more coercion than any bona fide cry of love of the Divine is.

('59', 98, 3, 5, 172975) 1 My statement 2 has not the meaning that you have assigned to it, as would be quite clear to you if you will read it as a whole.
('59', 98, 3, 6, 173105) I have considered myself to be incapable of coming to a judgement one way or the other, if only because I have not all the data for coming to a judgement.
('59', 98, 3, 7, 173260) I have therefore stated in unequivocal language that every Congressman has to decide for himself or herself, taking stock of the circumstances over which they alone have control and I have none, as also of their own individual obligations of which they alone can have knowledge and I can have none.

('59', 98, 8, 14, 173829) I do not remember having said whichever side stops correspondence is to be considered to have accepted the other’s position.
('59', 98, 8, 15, 173954) In my opinion such a thing should not be regarded as conclusive, because each party may exhaust all points of difference
('59', 98, 9, 16, 174075) 1 The addressee had written: ‘‘In answer to those Congressmen who wish to know whether they should prosecute the civil disobedience campaign or should take an active interest in the campaign against untouchability, you have reminded them of the celebrated English proverb: ‘Much wants more and loses all.’ I presume that you intend thereby to convey that we have had enough of the civil disobedience movement in the past and that we do not want it any longer, lest we stand to lose all that we aspire for.

('59', 99, 1, 3, 174742) However, you will not find me suddenly stopping the correspondence, because I want to get all the wisdom and all the information that I can from everyone.
('59', 99, 1, 4, 174897) Coming to your reply or rejoinder as you call it, I shall leave Acharya Dhruva to answer for himself, but you do not carry conviction even to a layman like myself.
('59', 99, 1, 5, 175061) You say that the word api 1
('59', 99, 2, 6, 175089) only denotes the unfitness of the Chandala and the height of the path of devotion.
('59', 99, 2, 7, 175172) Do you not see the inconsistency of your statement?
('59', 99, 2, 8, 175224) If the Chandala is unfit, there is no height (I suppose you mean ‘greatness’) about the path of devotion.
('59', 99, 2, 9, 175330) The path of devotion is truly great, because it brings peace and joy and salvation even to the Chandala.
('59', 99, 2, 10, 175435) Instances of the use of api by way of emphasis can surely be multiplied.
('59', 99, 2, 11, 175508) In your second paragraph, emphasis is not on the fact that here the Chandala was pious but that it was the Chandala who was speaking.
('59', 99, 2, 12, 175642) Most of the sanatanists who oppose temple entry by Harijans contend that no piety on the part of a Chandala would cure him of his disability.
('59', 99, 2, 13, 175784) In the third clause, your admission that all life as atman is one rules out the impassable barrier between touchables and untouchables.
('59', 99, 2, 14, 175920) The verse in question itself notes the differentiation between persons and bodies and yet insists on equality of treatment.
('59', 99, 2, 15, 176044) I need not labour the rest of your replies except to say that they are unconvincing to me.
('59', 99, 2, 16, 176135) However, without my comments on your reply, I am forwarding it to Acharya Dhruva, for his own independent reply which I shall gladly send to you when it comes to me.

('59', 102, 3, 4, 178906) DEAR FRIEND, I have your pathetic letter.
('59', 102, 3, 5, 178948) Do not mix up two questions, the fast and temple entry.
('59', 102, 3, 6, 179004) Dismiss the fast from your mind, because it is a personal matter and it may or may not come.
('59', 102, 3, 7, 179097) Temple entry is the question.
('59', 102, 3, 8, 179127) The economic and the educational questions are what the adjectives imply.
('59', 102, 3, 9, 179201) Temple entry is a spiritual act, transforming the whole society by one single act of admission.
('59', 102, 3, 10, 179297) It will electrify into a new life the whole of the Harijan population, and it will purify Hinduism as no single act that I can think of can do.
('59', 102, 3, 11, 179441) If you have the Hindu religious instinct in you, you will not find it difficult to follow my argument.
('59', 102, 3, 12, 179544) If you do not possess a living faith in Hinduism or do not consider temples an integral part of it, I have no effective argument to meet your difficulty.
('59', 102, 3, 13, 179698) On the contrary, I must then accept a defeat.

('59', 102, 8, 19, 179897) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for all your letters and the great pains you have been taking to instruct me and to supply me with the information I have wanted.
('59', 102, 8, 20, 180052) When I have studied all your letters I shall write to you if necessary at length.
('59', 102, 8, 21, 180134) Though you have not replied to my criticism about your letter paper, you seem to have done better by acting upon a part of my suggestion, namely, removing the portrait and the surrounding letter press; if the removal is an acknowledgement of the correctness of my criticism, you will note that my criticism was directed also against the ornamental border.

('59', 103, 7, 14, 181345) You have indeed fulfilled your self imposed vow, for the letter you have written to me is not for yourself.
('59', 103, 7, 15, 181453) I have already advised Amtussalaam to proceed to Delhi and I hope that she will leave the Ashram at once, stay there till you can discharge her fully cured and then return to the Ashram.

('59', 104, 3, 4, 182104) RADHAKRISHNA, I have read your letter to Jamnalalji.
('59', 104, 3, 5, 182157) The Ashram cannot run under its auspices the proposed Mahila Ashram or Mahila Vidyalaya or Vanita Ashram or Vanita Vidyalaya, because such an institution would not be prepared to accept Harijan girls at present.
('59', 104, 3, 6, 182369) It would not be possible to burden the institution with both the tasks.
('59', 104, 3, 7, 182441) It should be considered enough for it to admit Harijan girls as day scholars.
('59', 104, 3, 8, 182519) The Ashram cannot even lend the support of its name to suck an institution.
('59', 104, 3, 9, 182595) I agree with Vinobaji’s view and also feel that such a restriction on the scope of the Mahila Vidyalaya is inevitable.
('59', 104, 3, 10, 182714) Tell Janakibehn that I see no need at present to get Jamnalalji examined by Dr. Modi.
('59', 104, 3, 11, 182800) He is physically well enough.
('59', 104, 3, 12, 182830) The ear gives no trouble.
('59', 104, 3, 13, 182856) He can digest food fairly well and his weight has gone up.
('59', 104, 3, 14, 182915) There is no cause for worry at all.
('59', 104, 3, 15, 182951) Nor do I feel that Dr. Modi can say or do anything just now.
('59', 104, 3, 16, 183012) There would be no difficulty and no delay in making the necessary arrangements as soon as the slightest need is felt, or if Jamnalalji himself wishes to be examined by him.
('59', 104, 3, 17, 183185) I don’t think it advisable that he should be taken to Bombay just now.
('59', 104, 3, 18, 183256) Since the climate here has agreed with him, why make a change for a few days?
('59', 104, 3, 19, 183334) I got the two lengths of cloth woven from yarn spun by Grandmother.
('59', 104, 3, 20, 183402) I shall gladly wear them as a loving gift from her.
('59', 104, 3, 21, 183454) Kamalnayan was here, but went away without seeing me.

('59', 105, 9, 18, 184863) I think in purely religious matters Government aid should not be sought.
('59', 105, 9, 19, 184936) Anti untouchability work is essentially for Hindus to do.
('59', 105, 9, 20, 184994) It is a huge religious reform, and I should be chary of seeking financial assistance even if we had a purely national government, or if financial assistance is given, it will have to be under a scheme of just distribution to all the different

('59', 106, 6, 9, 185728) MY DEAR GHANSHYAMDAS, Here is the estimate for the proposed English edition of Harijan Sevak.
('59', 106, 6, 10, 185822) As you can see, it is a very moderate sum.
('59', 106, 6, 11, 185865) There will still be some overhead charges on clerical assistance, and whatever remunerat ion that might have to be paid to Shastri who has agreed to edit the paper.
('59', 106, 6, 12, 186030) I propose to bring out, to start with, 10,000 copies.
('59', 106, 6, 13, 186084) Then if there is not that demand, we might slow down.
('59', 106, 6, 14, 186138) My policy, as you know, is that I shall not handle the paper except to make it self supporting.
('59', 106, 6, 15, 186234) If it does not become self supporting, I should conclude that there is inefficient management or editing, or that there is no public demand for such a paper.
('59', 106, 6, 16, 186392) In any one of these cases, if the defect cannot be mended, the paper must be ended.
('59', 106, 6, 17, 186476) I should give the paper a trial for three months, within which time it must become self supporting.
('59', 106, 6, 18, 186576) I would therefore like you, after consultation with Thakkar Bapa and such others as you need to consult, to telegraph your sanction of the expenditure, such as it may be, up to the final limit to be fixed by you.
('59', 106, 6, 19, 186789) I suggest an addition of Rs. 200 per month at the outside to the figures as per estimate, excluding the postal and telegraphic charges.
('59', 106, 6, 20, 186925) I should be able to give you more definite figures after I have seen Shastri.
('59', 106, 6, 21, 187003) If you can pass the budget, should I proceed with the paper whether you have brought out the Hindi edition or not?
('59', 106, 6, 22, 187118) I understand that there is not likely to be any difficulty at this end about bringing out the paper.
('59', 106, 6, 23, 187219) I have your telegram from Gwalior about the Government decision on the untouchability Bills.

('59', 107, 6, 11, 188092) January 25, 1933
('59', 107, 7, 12, 188109) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('59', 107, 7, 13, 188142) Here are my answers: The opening of temples to Harijans is to be an act of penance on the part of caste Hindus or rather an act of payment of an obligation due to them.
('59', 107, 7, 14, 188311) 2 That one act will elevate them.
('59', 107, 7, 15, 188345) Throwingopen of temples to them is the foundation for their elevation and not a reward for good behaviour.
('59', 107, 7, 16, 188452) They will only be liable to the same conditions as caste Hindus are as to daily bath, etc.
('59', 107, 7, 17, 188543) But just as we do not ask every caste Hindu who enters a temple whether he has conformed to the conditions or not, unless he bears the mark of non performance on his own person at the time of entry, even so we may not cross question a Harijan in appearance showing no disregard of conditions whether he has fulfilled other conditions or not.
('59', 107, 7, 18, 188885) Please remember that abstention from flesh and drink is not an indispensable condition of entry for caste Hindus in all sects of Hinduism.
('59', 107, 7, 19, 189024) Personally, I would like such abstention to be a condition, but it cannot be imposed upon Harijans, if it is not imposed upon all Hindus.
('59', 107, 7, 20, 189162) If three or four orthodox Brahmins cause obstruction, miscalled satyagraha, by stretching themselves in front of the temple, they can be easily dodged.
('59', 107, 7, 21, 189314) Temple entry is not complete until Harijans are

('59', 108, 1, 3, 189587) There is no question of Harijans entering the sanctuary if caste Hindus do not enter the sanctuary and only those who perform the ceremonial are allowed to enter.

('59', 111, 6, 9, 193753) BHAI RATUBHAI, I got your letter.
('59', 111, 6, 10, 193787) I too had a wire from Lilavati.
('59', 111, 6, 11, 193819) I sent a wire asking not to commit me in advance.
('59', 111, 6, 12, 193869) They should allow me to see Padma.
('59', 111, 6, 13, 193904) I would like to see the boy too.
('59', 111, 6, 14, 193937) Jekibehn came to see me yesterday and she told me: ‘‘Padma is yet only 14 years old and the boy is immoral.” What can I say if the parents are willing?
('59', 111, 6, 15, 194089) But if I do not approve of the match, they should not ask me to say I do.
('59', 111, 6, 16, 194163) What is your opinion about this marriage?
('59', 111, 6, 17, 194205) Even you should keep me out of it.
('59', 111, 6, 18, 194240) I can only interfere wherever you all wish me to.
('59', 111, 6, 19, 194290) I cannot at all insist on anything.
('59', 111, 6, 20, 194326) I want to write to Chhaganlal and Lilavati too about the firm.
('59', 111, 6, 21, 194389) I have written to them to come and see me.
('59', 111, 6, 22, 194432) Come and see me when Maganlal arrives.
('59', 111, 6, 23, 194471) Keep on writing to Chhaganlal and Lilavati.

('59', 112, 2, 3, 194756) January 25, 1933
('59', 112, 3, 4, 194773) BHAI CHHOTALAL, I got your letter.
('59', 112, 3, 5, 194808) There is a great difference between varna and caste.
('59', 112, 3, 6, 194861) There are innumerable castes, but only four varnas.
('59', 112, 3, 7, 194913) Varna refers to a person’s qualities of character and occupation.
('59', 112, 3, 8, 194979) Caste is based at best on convenience.
('59', 112, 3, 9, 195018) Caste deserves to be abolished, whereas varna should be reformed.
('59', 112, 3, 10, 195084) There is a confusion of varnas at present, but it is possible and necessary to reform the system.
('59', 112, 3, 11, 195182) There may perhaps be no harm in serving one’s own community, but the best service which one can do to it is to cultivate relations with members of other communities.
('59', 112, 3, 12, 195348) One should not be attached to one’s own caste and be proud of it.
('59', 112, 3, 13, 195414) Though interdining and intermarriage will be restricted to groups of similar temperament and occupation, that is, within the limits of the same varna, this was not an essential feature of the system in former times.

('59', 112, 7, 18, 195733) January 25, 1933
('59', 112, 8, 19, 195750) NARANDAS, I get your letters.
('59', 112, 8, 20, 195780) If occasionally you cannot write for want of time, I will know that that was the reason and also that there was nothing urgent to write about.
('59', 112, 8, 21, 195923) It seems you note the weights of only the boys and girls.
('59', 112, 8, 22, 195981) Since we wish to know the effect of the new regimen, it would be better if you note the weights of all the inmates.
('59', 112, 8, 23, 196097) You may do so every fortnight.
('59', 112, 8, 24, 196128) The weights should be recorded on fixed dates in a separate register kept for the purpose.
('59', 112, 8, 25, 196219) Have you shown in the record of weights sent to me the weekly increases?
('59', 112, 8, 26, 196292) In every case in which there is loss in weight, the reason, if it can be ascertained, should be noted.
('59', 112, 8, 27, 196395) What effect did the change have on the
('59', 113, 0, 1, 196434) 114 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 113, 1, 2, 196476) incidence of constipation?
('59', 113, 1, 3, 196503) Can we say by how much the consumption of rice has decreased?
('59', 113, 1, 4, 196565) I should like a record maintained of the quantity of each kind of grain consumed and the number of persons among whom consumed and the record sent to me.
('59', 113, 1, 5, 196719) What vegetables do you serve?
('59', 113, 1, 6, 196749) Do you buy any from the market or what is produced in the Ashram suffices?
('59', 113, 1, 7, 196824) Does any fruit grow in sufficient quantity in the Ashram to meet your requirements fully?
('59', 113, 1, 8, 196914) I know that you require time to think about and plan all this.
('59', 113, 1, 9, 196977) You may carry out only those of my suggestions which you can and leave the rest.
('59', 113, 1, 10, 197058) If, however, we can have correct information on these matters, we can so plan things as to benefit considerably both in regard to health and expenditure.
('59', 113, 1, 11, 197212) Our farm, orchard and kitchen should be run with this aim in view.
('59', 113, 1, 12, 197279) It is not, it ought not to be, beyond our capacity to banish illness from the Ashram.
('59', 113, 1, 13, 197365) All that is necessary is that somebody should pay attention to the problem and maintain strict vigilance about it.
('59', 113, 1, 14, 197480) If you can select someone from among the many workers at your disposal, train him for the job.
('59', 113, 1, 15, 197575) You can train even some of the boys or girls if you find them suitable.
('59', 113, 1, 16, 197647) I was pleased by the certificate which you have given to Kanhaiyalal.
('59', 113, 1, 17, 197717) What progress has his wife made?
('59', 113, 1, 18, 197750) Tell him about the climate of Orissa.
('59', 113, 1, 19, 197788) If their health is not good, don’t send them to Orissa just now.
('59', 113, 1, 20, 197853) If, however, they are ready to endure all hardships, they may leave even now.
('59', 113, 1, 21, 197931) I am glad to learn that Manekbai has arrived there.
('59', 113, 1, 22, 197983) I don’t suppose you knew her before.
('59', 113, 1, 23, 198020) I hope Ba sees her frequently.
('59', 113, 1, 24, 198051) Amtussalaam must have left for Delhi.
('59', 113, 1, 25, 198089) I got the slivers sent with Prabhudas.
('59', 113, 1, 26, 198128) There is no change in the condition of my elbow.
('59', 113, 1, 27, 198177) However, I have started spinning since yesterday.
('59', 113, 1, 28, 198227) As there has been no improvement though I had stopped spinning, I don’t think it right to continue the restriction.
('59', 113, 1, 29, 198343) I have informed the doctor, too.
('59', 113, 1, 30, 198376) If the pain increases, I will stop spinning again.
('59', 113, 1, 31, 198427) I am not being unnecessarily obstinate in this matter.
('59', 113, 1, 32, 198482) I look at it entirely from the point of view of dharma.
('59', 113, 1, 33, 198538) I am certainly very glad that jowar 1 and bajri 2 are grown in the Ashram itself.
('59', 113, 1, 34, 198620) It would certainly be good if the hand mill is revived even for our own needs only.
('59', 113, 1, 35, 198704) But I am afraid that this

('59', 114, 6, 11, 199312) We workers would then have no chance of seeing where we stand vis a vis the people.
('59', 114, 6, 12, 199396) Our initial proposition therefore should be to have an eating house run to suit our own convenience.

('59', 114, 11, 19, 199603) In my view it is misplaced pity or excess of pity and hence it is violence.

('59', 114, 11, 21, 199721) Therefore wherever I shall see the absence of truth I shall immediately tell you about it.
('59', 114, 11, 22, 199812) You are open minded.
('59', 114, 11, 23, 199833) And so you will certainly progress.
('59', 114, 11, 24, 199869) Truth and non violence both demand fearlessness.
('59', 114, 11, 25, 199918) If that is lacking, there is often a chance of untruth creeping in.
('59', 114, 11, 26, 199986) And where an untruth has been committed, it is violence as well.
('59', 114, 11, 27, 200051) Hence let the world laugh at you or call you a fool or bury you alive or starve you—but we shall always observe truth.

('59', 116, 3, 6, 202234) I am hoping that Mr. Ranga Iyer’s Bill being of a negative character, all Hindus will see that it does not interfere with religion in any shape or form and if sanatanists admit that the Harijans should suffer under no social disabilities they must make good their admission by welcoming the measure.
('59', 116, 3, 7, 202534) They do not seem to seek legal protection for enforcing religious observances.
('59', 116, 3, 8, 202613) Religious observance ceases to be religious, the moment it becomes enforceable by law.
('59', 116, 3, 9, 202700) It must depend on mutual goodwill and on the readiness of Hindus in general to perform religious observances.
('59', 116, 3, 10, 202810) There are numerous religious observances in the Hindu religion as in all other religions but they are not enforceable by law and what Mr. Ranga Iyer’s Bill provides is that the religious prohibition against temple entry should not be forced at the point of the bayonet.
('59', 116, 3, 11, 203080) But should the sanatanists not appreciate this obvious proposition of mine and there is opposition to the Bill, it would become a question for me as to what would be my duty.
('59', 116, 3, 12, 203255) But I am hoping that there would be an unequivocal declaration by the vast mass of Hindus to favour the Bill so as to compel the acceleration of its passage through all its stages.

('59', 116, 6, 15, 203491) January 26, 1933
('59', 116, 7, 16, 203508) MIRA, This is before prayer time Thursday.
('59', 116, 7, 17, 203551) I get your weekly letter Wednesday noon and I write the reply Thursday morning after prayer or sometimes before as now.
('59', 116, 7, 18, 203671) So whenever you get my letter later than usual or not at all?
('59', 116, 7, 19, 203733) you will know that there has been no delay on my part.
('59', 116, 7, 20, 203788) But accidents will happen in the best of all possible worlds.
('59', 116, 7, 21, 203850) There is no such thing as accident in God’s dictionary.
('59', 117, 0, 1, 203906) 118 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 117, 1, 2, 203948) world is a chapter of accidents.
('59', 117, 1, 3, 203981) For accidents are events which we cannot control and often can’t find causes for even after they have occurred.
('59', 117, 1, 4, 204093) As you see I have again taken to writing by the right hand.
('59', 117, 1, 5, 204153) I do not do much writing.
('59', 117, 1, 6, 204179) Some Gujarati every day not more than two hours and the weekly English letter to you.
('59', 117, 1, 7, 204265) That cannot injure the hand.
('59', 117, 1, 8, 204294) At least no one has suggested that as the cause.
('59', 117, 1, 9, 204343) The wheel was blamed.
('59', 117, 1, 10, 204365) But even that seems to be an exploded theory.
('59', 117, 1, 11, 204411) I recommenced moderate spinning on Tuesday last.
('59', 117, 1, 12, 204460) But I shall not be obstinate.
('59', 117, 1, 13, 204490) I shall give it up, if the pain increases.
('59', 117, 1, 14, 204533) The weight went down 2 lb.
('59', 117, 1, 15, 204560) yesterday but the little fluctuation is a matter of no concern whatsoever.
('59', 117, 1, 16, 204635) Now about yourself.
('59', 117, 1, 17, 204655) Whatever the cause of that giddiness, you ought to discuss with the doctor.
('59', 117, 1, 18, 204731) If it is due to the stenches, you should be transferred to a better place.
('59', 117, 1, 19, 204806) If you do not mind I would like to write to the Government myself.
('59', 117, 1, 20, 204873) You have a very sensitive nose and therefore are more readily acted upon than others by foul smells.
('59', 117, 1, 21, 204974) Shall I apply for transfer?
('59', 117, 1, 22, 205002) Perhaps you will be allowed to answer this question apart from your usual weekly letter.
('59', 117, 1, 23, 205091) Blind Morris 1 will appreciate your letter.
('59', 117, 1, 24, 205135) It will be an event with him for many days.
('59', 117, 1, 25, 205179) This reminds me of Mrs. Aiman.
('59', 117, 1, 26, 205210) Did you know her?
('59', 117, 1, 27, 205228) Andrews says we all did.
('59', 117, 1, 28, 205253) Mahadev remembers her.
('59', 117, 1, 29, 205276) I cannot.
('59', 117, 1, 30, 205286) If you do, you may know that she is no more.
('59', 117, 1, 31, 205331) Aiman is connected with 112 Gower Street.
('59', 117, 1, 32, 205373) Andrews made me write to Mr. Aiman.
('59', 117, 1, 33, 205409) The expression “There is no prayer without fasting” is thoroughly sound.
('59', 117, 1, 34, 205482) Here fasting has to be of the widest character possible.
('59', 117, 1, 35, 205539) Fasting of the body has to be accompanied by fasting of all the senses.
('59', 117, 1, 36, 205611) And alpahar, the meagre food of the Gita, is also a fasting of the body.
('59', 117, 1, 37, 205684) The Gita enjoins not temperance in food but ‘meagreness’.
('59', 117, 1, 38, 205742) Meagreness is a perpetual fast.
('59', 117, 1, 39, 205774) Meagreness means just enough to sustain the body for the service for which it is made.
('59', 117, 1, 40, 205861) The test is again supplied by saying that food should be taken as required, not for taste but for the welfare of the body.
('59', 117, 1, 41, 205984) ‘Meagreness’ is perhaps better rendered by ‘measured quantities’.
('59', 117, 1, 42, 206050) I cannot recall Arnold’s rendering.
('59', 117, 1, 43, 206086) A ‘full’ meal is therefore a crime against God and man— the latter because the full mealers deprive their neighbours of their portion.
('59', 117, 1, 44, 206221) God’s economy provides from day to day just enough food

('59', 118, 1, 2, 206363) for all in just medicinal doses.
('59', 118, 1, 3, 206396) We are all of the tribe of full mealers.
('59', 118, 1, 4, 206437) Instinctively to know the medicinal dose required is a Herculean task.
('59', 118, 1, 5, 206508) For by parental training we are gluttons.
('59', 118, 1, 6, 206550) Then when it is almost too late it dawns upon some of us that food is made not to enjoy but to sustain the body as our slave.
('59', 118, 1, 7, 206676) It becomes from that moment a grim fight against inherited and acquired habit of eating for pleasure.
('59', 118, 1, 8, 206778) Hence the necessity for a complete fast at intervals and partial fasts for ever.
('59', 118, 1, 9, 206859) Partial fast is the meagre or measured food of the Gita.
('59', 118, 1, 10, 206916) Thus ‘There is no prayer without fasting, is a scientific proposition capable of verification by experiment and experience.
('59', 118, 1, 11, 207040) Yes, I remember Manorama.
('59', 118, 1, 12, 207066) Poor girl.
('59', 118, 1, 13, 207077) If I know where she is to go, I would gladly write to her.
('59', 118, 1, 14, 207136) If she is there, here is a note for her.
('59', 118, 1, 15, 207177) The Superintendent will kindly hand it to her or to you for giving it to her or if she is transferred, send the letter to her.
('59', 118, 1, 16, 207304) Love from us all.

('59', 119, 2, 3, 207746) January 26, 1933
('59', 119, 3, 4, 207763) MY DEAR MARY,
('59', 119, 4, 5, 207777) I have your two letters, but not knowing whether any letter from me could reach you at Tirupattur I have refrained from writing and am now sending you this in the hope that you will receive it at the Bombay address given by you.
('59', 119, 4, 6, 208006) I am trying to reach you at the Poona station also through Shastri, for if you want to stay in Bombay for two or three days, you will stay where I stay in Bombay.
('59', 119, 4, 7, 208169) The place you know: “Mani Bhuvan, Laburnum Road, Gamdevi”.
('59', 119, 4, 8, 208228) You will present the accompanying note to Manibhai or Dhirubhai, the two brothers.
('59', 119, 4, 9, 208311) It is as good as a home.
('59', 119, 4, 10, 208336) You will find there also the late Dr. Mehta’s daughter, Jekibehn.
('59', 119, 4, 11, 208402) Of course if you stay there one or two days, you should meet as many members of the growing family that you have entered.
('59', 119, 4, 12, 208524) You might have to pay heavily for the choice you have made.
('59', 119, 4, 13, 208584) Perhaps you know something of what it has cost Mira to become a daughter.
('59', 119, 4, 14, 208658) She is generally the Cinderella not however 2 having the expectation of getting the golden slipper some day or other.
('59', 119, 4, 15, 208776) I sent you a card 3 telling you that I have received the book The Little Plays of St. Francis.
('59', 119, 4, 16, 208871) I got on to one of the plays marked by you, I suppose, and perhaps that is all the progress I shall have made with it.
('59', 119, 4, 17, 208990) It is a hopeless thing for me to try to read or do anything outside the work in front of me.
('59', 119, 4, 18, 209083) About idol worship I would like you not to worry.
('59', 119, 4, 19, 209133) Let it unconsciously simmer in the brain, and when you have leisure and I have leisure and we can meet, you will discuss it to your heart’s content.
('59', 119, 4, 20, 209282) But if there is a difficulty that gnaws you, you must have it out and I shall try patiently to solve it if I can.
('59', 119, 4, 21, 209396) At the Ashram you are going to be truly at home and ask

('59', 119, 5, 23, 209657) So he had sent four letters to make sure that one unimportant person should be safe and comfortable in Bombay.
('59', 119, 5, 24, 209768) Could any meticulous business man do more for his partner, or loving father for his daughter?” 2 The source has “who”.

('59', 120, 1, 2, 209975) everything that you may need for physical comfort.
('59', 120, 1, 3, 210026) I will not easily forgive you if you damage your health, because the foolish people at the Ashram could not anticipate your want and you foolishly would not express it.
('59', 120, 1, 4, 210195) I would call it ‘not playing the game’.
('59', 120, 1, 5, 210235) I am supposed to have the instinct of a mother.
('59', 120, 1, 6, 210283) I do often succeed in anticipating people’s wants, but I admit that I have also failed miserably and not anticipated wants that I should have.
('59', 120, 1, 7, 210426) I have therefore exacted a promise even from guests that if they would make me feel at ease about them, they would at once tell me what they need.
('59', 120, 1, 8, 210573) If I had the time, I could give you some ludicrous instances, all at my expense, of how, if the friends had not told me, they would have made themselves miserable and judged me uncharitably in the bargain.
('59', 120, 1, 9, 210779) People at the Ashram are a self satisfied lot.
('59', 120, 1, 10, 210826) They think that nobody can possibly want more than they do, wherein they are quite wrong.
('59', 120, 1, 11, 210916) They would be quite right if they were to say nobody should want more than they do, for they themselves take more than what they should want and more than [what] millions of people get.
('59', 120, 1, 12, 211102) Again, don’t think that the Ashram is an abode of angels where there can be no pilfering.
('59', 120, 1, 13, 211192) As it so happens, we have just now very dangerous neighbours.
('59', 120, 1, 14, 211254) Their occupation is stealing at night, and in broad daylight, and that without ally compunction.
('59', 120, 1, 15, 211351) Quite selfishly we are trying to do some work in their midst.
('59', 120, 1, 16, 211413) I say selfishly, because through that service we would like them to leave the Ashram untouched, but they don’t, and they say it quite frankly.
('59', 120, 1, 17, 211556) You will make their acquaintance if you are so minded.
('59', 120, 1, 18, 211611) These are the known thieves, but there are unknown thieves also to warn you that you are not entitled to possess anything beyond the poorest garment that you have on your person and the coarsest food with which you can manage.
('59', 120, 1, 19, 211838) But if you will have more than that, you expose yourself to be deprived of the superfluities by those who are in greater need.
('59', 120, 1, 20, 211965) We have the vow of non possession in the Ashram, but we do not follow it strictly.
('59', 120, 1, 21, 212048) At the present moment it is only there as an ideal.
('59', 120, 1, 22, 212100) You should study the rules of the Ashram, if you have not done so already.

('59', 121, 2, 3, 212433) January 26, 1933
('59', 121, 3, 4, 212450) DEAR DR.
('59', 121, 3, 5, 212459) SAPRU, I hope that you have benefited by your English visit and that the strain this time was not anything like what it was in 1931. This is however to seek your guidance about Ranga Iyer’s Bill about untouchability.
('59', 121, 3, 6, 212676) If you have not already read my statement 1 on the Government of India announcement sanctioning the introduction of the All India Bill and withholding it for the Madras Bill, I would ask you please now to read it, and then criticize it freely, and tell me how to go about it.
('59', 121, 3, 7, 212952) To be interested in the passage of Bills is an experience I have not had since the passing of the Champaran Ryots’ Relief Bill in 1917. But then my task was easy, as both the Government of Bihar and of India were interested in its passage, and it was a Government measure.
('59', 121, 3, 8, 213225) Here the circumstances are quite novel.
('59', 121, 3, 9, 213265) I therefore approach you, as to an expert, and if you think that you would like a conversation with me before you could guide me, I know that you would not mind taking the trouble of running down to Yeravda.
('59', 121, 3, 10, 213473) I hope that your son who had that nasty accident just after the Yeravda Pact has no trace left of it.

('59', 121, 5, 15, 213726) January 26; 1933
('59', 121, 6, 16, 213743) MY DEAR SATISBABOO,
('59', 121, 7, 17, 213763) I understand every word of what you have said in your letter of the 21st and you are going to do as the spirit leads you.
('59', 121, 7, 18, 213885) I must think aloud all the reactions that your letters produce upon me so that whenever they find an echo in your heart, you may re adjust yourself
('59', 121, 8, 19, 214033) 1 Vide “Statement on Viceroy’s Decision”, 24 1 1933
('59', 122, 0, 1, 214085) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 123
('59', 122, 1, 2, 214130) accordingly.
('59', 122, 1, 3, 214143) But there is to be no re adjustment if there is no such echo in your heart because in reading letters, even yours, hurriedly, I may miss a word here and a word there which may alter a conclusion equally hurriedly come to.
('59', 122, 1, 4, 214365) Thus, take this startling statement of yours—I mean startling for me—“As soon as I feel that I have been able to set up some arrangement for serving the Harijans on proper basis, I shall revert to my old field of activity.” This is what you would undoubtedly do as a chemist and mechanic, as you have done so successfully often.
('59', 122, 1, 5, 214694) But service of Harijans is no such mechanical thing to be arranged, put on a basis, and then left to workers.
('59', 122, 1, 6, 214804) It is a spiritual act, soul acting upon soul, and therefore there is no such mechanical replacement as we have in purely temporal activities.
('59', 122, 1, 7, 214946) There do come replacements even in spiritual activities, but those replacements are of a different character.
('59', 122, 1, 8, 215056) Even the Pratishthan work is a spiritual activity but can be arranged up to a point as a temporal activity; not so the Harijan work.
('59', 122, 1, 9, 215189) Your great organizing ability may even be a hindrance than a help in doing Harijan work, for you might have to plough what may appear to be a lonely furrow without yielding any fruit which you can see with your physical eyes.
('59', 122, 1, 10, 215415) You have simply to believe that fruit is there whether you see it or not.
('59', 122, 1, 11, 215489) Thus having once taken up Harijan work in the style that you have, there is no reversion to the “old field of activity”.
('59', 122, 1, 12, 215610) Reversion can only be consistently with the unimpaired continuance of Harijan service.
('59', 122, 1, 13, 215697) I wonder if I have made my meaning perfectly clear.
('59', 122, 1, 14, 215749) Of course your conception of personal service in the basti may be quite different from mine.
('59', 122, 1, 15, 215842) You are not to fit in mine with your own.
('59', 122, 1, 16, 215884) You must hold on to your own, unless mine appeals to you as the correct one.
('59', 122, 1, 17, 215961) The two won’t run together.
('59', 122, 1, 18, 215989) But all this is only by way of illustration as to what I am trying to drive at.
('59', 122, 1, 19, 216069) Please also bear in mind that whenever you feel like running down to Poona, you should do so.
('59', 122, 1, 20, 216163) It won’t be money thrown away.
('59', 122, 1, 21, 216194) Andrews has done it so often with me.
('59', 122, 1, 22, 216232) He has not even heeded my chiding, for, he would say, “What you consider to be waste of money is for me a definite want which I must satisfy”, and from his own standpoint he has been right.
('59', 122, 1, 23, 216422) He would have been torn to pieces if he had not run to me.
('59', 122, 1, 24, 216481) No writing of letters would have satisfied him.
('59', 122, 1, 25, 216529) Even as I am dictating this letter a cablegram has come to me from him.
('59', 122, 1, 26, 216601) Just now he is sending a cablegram per day.
('59', 122, 1, 27, 216645) This is a costly affair, but I cannot restrain him.
('59', 122, 1, 28, 216697) I do not need his cablegrams, but he needs to send them for his peace.
('59', 122, 1, 29, 216768) Look at this latest samples: “Thank God—Charlie, Esther”.
('59', 122, 1, 30, 216826) This cablegram
('59', 123, 0, 1, 216841) 124 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 123, 1, 2, 216883) perhaps you cannot even understand but it has a world of meaning for me.
('59', 123, 1, 3, 216956) The latest statement of mine has reached him and as he drafted his cable under Esther’s roof, he added her name, for Esther is like a daughter to me.
('59', 123, 1, 4, 217106) But the cablegram has no place in the plan of Harijan service, and considered in terms of money it deprives Harijans of so much money.
('59', 123, 1, 5, 217241) If, after your walk of 26 miles in one day, you had no sense of over fatigue, you are certainly in a fit state, and if that is due to the pills you took, it is worth knowing them.
('59', 123, 1, 6, 217421) I would like to be just as free from anxiety about Hemprabha’s health as you are making me about yours.

('59', 123, 12, 20, 217939) MY DEAR SALIVATI, I have now got from Madras a true copy of your message.
('59', 123, 12, 21, 218013) So far as I can see it, there is complete justification for my complaint.
('59', 123, 12, 22, 218087) I am afraid that your over zeal has led you astray.
('59', 123, 12, 23, 218139) Thinking that you must have a copy yourself by now, I am not sending you the copy in front of me, but you can have it if you want to see it.

('59', 124, 6, 8, 218599) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter 1. I do not quite understand what you are driving at.
('59', 124, 6, 9, 218694) Is it the handful of Congressmen who are serving the anti untouchability campaign who are misbehaving themselves, or, is it the very large body of non Congress reformers who are the mischief makers?
('59', 124, 6, 10, 218893) Is your complaint against the Congressmen or the other reformers exploiting my fast which may never come?
('59', 124, 6, 11, 218999) If you have any proof in your possession that Harijans do not want temple entry, I should like to have that proof, and supposing that what you say is true, is that any reason for caste Hindus not to discharge the obligation that they owe to Harijans?
('59', 124, 6, 12, 219250) Then, is it any argument against reformers that they do not carry out the principle of equality in all their transactions?
('59', 124, 6, 13, 219373) May not imperfect human beings take part to the best of their ability in the progress of mankind?

('59', 125, 3, 4, 219968) NARANDAS, Read my letter to Kanhaiyalal.
('59', 125, 3, 5, 220009) It would be very good if Amina could be sent to Sharda Mandir.
('59', 125, 3, 6, 220072) Read my letter to Qureshi too.
('59', 125, 3, 7, 220103) It would help Bhau very much if he could go to Rajkot.
('59', 125, 3, 8, 220158) He and Jamnadas will like each other’s company.
('59', 125, 3, 9, 220206) If for any reason Bhau does not feel comfortable in Rajkot, send him here.
('59', 125, 3, 10, 220281) I will arrange for him to stay at Lady Thackersey’s place and keep a watch on his health.
('59', 125, 3, 11, 220371) I will also give him some work to do.
('59', 125, 3, 12, 220409) His constipation must be cured.
('59', 125, 3, 13, 220441) You must have received the letters posted yesterday.
('59', 125, 3, 14, 220494) Let me pass on to you one discovery which I have made.
('59', 125, 3, 15, 220549) If it is very cold at night or at any other time, one can keep oneself warm by wrapping paper round oneself.
('59', 125, 3, 16, 220658) If the cotton sheet used for covering the body during sleep is further covered with paper, one will immediately feel warm.
('59', 125, 3, 17, 220781) It is very cold here these days.
('59', 125, 3, 18, 220814) But I sleep in the open.
('59', 125, 3, 19, 220839) Even three blankets are not enough to keep off cold.
('59', 125, 3, 20, 220892) I don’t have the courage, or I don’t want to use a fourth blanket.
('59', 125, 3, 21, 220959) So once I put a newspaper between the cotton sheet and the blanket, as also under the bed sheet.
('59', 125, 3, 22, 221056) This gave more than enough warmth.
('59', 125, 3, 23, 221091) For a long time now I have been covering the legs, when they feel very cold, with a newspaper and keep them warm.
('59', 125, 3, 24, 221205) If one puts paper on the plastered floor when sitting, it does not feel cold.
('59', 125, 3, 25, 221283) These are a poor man’s ways of keeping himself warm.
('59', 125, 3, 26, 221336) That even these are not available to the village folk is a different problem.

('59', 126, 8, 12, 221885) QURESHI, I got your letter.
('59', 126, 8, 13, 221913) The boys must be given education in Islam from their childhood.
('59', 126, 8, 14, 221977) I will not hesitate to keep the children with Noor Banu for whatever reason.
('59', 126, 8, 15, 222054) I regard her as one of the family.
('59', 126, 8, 16, 222089) It is essential that the children should get instruction in Islam and Amina should get the training she needs at present.
('59', 126, 8, 17, 222211) Don’t mind the children being separated from her in the process.
('59', 126, 8, 18, 222276) If we keep insisting on this, a Hindu institution would impart instruction in Islam and a Muslim institution instruction in Hinduism.
('59', 126, 8, 19, 222410) Such a day may be distant but is not inconceivable.
('59', 126, 8, 20, 222462) You may have read in the Autobiography that I used to do that in South Africa.
('59', 126, 8, 21, 222541) I had Muslim, Christian and Prasi children with me.
('59', 126, 8, 22, 222593) They got religious instruction to the extent I could provide them such instruction.
('59', 126, 8, 23, 222677) At the moment, however, this is only a dream.
('59', 126, 8, 24, 222723) I have mentioned it only by the way.
('59', 126, 8, 25, 222760) I should be very pleased if they admit Amina to Sharda Mandir.
('59', 126, 8, 26, 222823) She need not worry at all.
('59', 126, 8, 27, 222850) If she does not feel comfortable there, she can go back to the Ashram.
('59', 126, 8, 28, 222921) Why need one feel ashamed of returning to one’s home?
('59', 126, 8, 29, 222975) And in any case Amina will be joining Sharda Mandir for education.
('59', 126, 8, 30, 223042) I greatly value the benefits of education.
('59', 126, 8, 31, 223085) If Amina studies well and then devotes herself to service, Imam Saheb’s soul, wherever it may be, will be pleased.
('59', 126, 8, 32, 223200) Let Amina join that particular school without second thought.

('59', 128, 7, 10, 224933) I have your letters and plenty of cablegrams.
('59', 128, 7, 11, 224979) 1 I know their meaning and the anxiety complex underlying them.
('59', 128, 7, 12, 225043) I have no doubt that the Government of India should have given their assent to the introduction of both the Bills.
('59', 128, 7, 13, 225158) But the sanatanist agitation has frightened them.
('59', 128, 7, 14, 225208) I do not mind however the refusal to give the assent to Dr. Subbaroyan’s Bill.
('59', 128, 7, 15, 225287) No doubt it protracts the agony, but that cannot be helped.
('59', 128, 7, 16, 225347) After all, it is the Hindu mass mind that has to be awakened.
('59', 128, 7, 17, 225409) If the touchable Hindus are not ready for the removal of untouchability, I do not want even the all India Bill, though, as you will see, from my statement 2 on the Bill, it is perfectly harmless.
('59', 128, 7, 18, 225605) It simply refuses to give the sanction of secular law to untouchability, thus leaving free scope to the reformers and the objectors to carry on the education of the masses.
('59', 128, 7, 19, 225778) It is strictly a Bill of non interference either way.
('59', 128, 7, 20, 225832) Nevertheless, I shall be prepared to reconcile myself to the Bill being blocked by the Government, if it is conclusively proved that caste Hindus will not have it.
('59', 128, 7, 21, 225996) My difficulty is to prove the readiness of the vast mass of caste men for the change, unless the Government are prepared to accept the ordinary methods of proof.
('59', 128, 7, 22, 226158) Just at present a vicious agitation that, so far as I am aware, has no authority from the public at large is being conducted in the name of sanatana dharma.
('59', 128, 7, 23, 226315) It is difficult to show to outsiders that it has no genuine public support.
('59', 128, 7, 24, 226391) If this agitation is taken to be the genuine expression of the Hindu
('59', 128, 8, 25, 226460) 1 The addressee had written in his letter dated January 13 that it would be better if the proposed legislation regarding untouchability was made “an all India question” and dealt with by the Central Legislature rather than by the Madras Council.

('59', 129, 4, 18, 227850) My faith has not weakened; if anything, it has become stronger.
('59', 129, 4, 19, 227914) Civic rights will certainly be protected by law if they are to be worth anything.
('59', 129, 4, 20, 227996) There is no question of Harijans existing on the sufferance of anybody.
('59', 129, 4, 21, 228068) But law is one thing, cultivation of public opinion wholly another.
('59', 129, 4, 22, 228136) Society holds together on the strength not of law but of mutual goodwill, and unless the majority of caste Hindus are converted, there is not much use in the law protecting rights which the majority is not prepared to recognize.
('59', 129, 4, 23, 228365) The whole of the present campaign is directed towards cultivating and ascertaining the opinion of caste Hindus.
('59', 129, 4, 24, 228477) The legal guarantees and all that they mean are bound to be there, but they will be an expression of the will of the majority and not a superimposition.

('59', 130, 3, 6, 228869) I gave you plenty of time the other day, and I am giving you time by answering your letters promptly, and I would have, given you more time by inviting you if I had found your proposal 1 to be sound or even workable.
('59', 130, 3, 7, 229086) Let me tell you that it is not in any sense a new suggestion.
('59', 130, 3, 8, 229148) It was put before me when I returned from South Africa in 1915 and I rejected it.
('59', 130, 3, 9, 229230) It is a bad training for the Harijans and it is bad also for caste Hindus.
('59', 130, 3, 10, 229305) What however you and I want is that caste Hindus should do penance and make reparation to those whom they have ignorantly or may be even insolently regarded as untouchables.
('59', 130, 3, 11, 229479) What is therefore wanted in terms of religion is not a fraud, however pardonable, but a conscious act on the part of caste Hindus of welcoming Harijans with open arms.
('59', 130, 3, 12, 229647) That Hinduism has absorbed people who were once under boycott but who had stolen in by assuming other names is only too true.
('59', 130, 3, 13, 229773) But it is not in my opinion a practice to be copied.
('59', 130, 3, 14, 229826) I wish I could convince you that the removal of untouchability 2 is purely a religious problem which does not admit of questionable methods or tricks.
('59', 130, 3, 15, 229977) Do you not now agree with me?
('59', 130, 4, 16, 230007) Yours sincerely,

('59', 130, 7, 19, 230085) January 27, 1933
('59', 130, 8, 20, 230102) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter.
('59', 130, 8, 21, 230144) You evidently contemplate that those who are seeking the assistance of law whether in British India or in the States want to force people to do anything against their will, especially in matters of religion.
('59', 130, 8, 22, 230352) What is wanted is that there should be no State recognition of untouchability.
('59', 130, 8, 23, 230431) At the present moment there is
('59', 130, 9, 24, 230462) 1 That untouchables should give up caste names like Mahar, Mang, Chambhar, Dhor, etc.
('59', 130, 9, 25, 230548) source has “this method of untouchability”.
('59', 131, 0, 1, 230592) 132 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 131, 1, 2, 230634) this anomaly that the State not only recognizes untouchability, but helps believers in it to enforce their views against others, thus making what they believe to be a religious precept a matter of legal obligation.
('59', 131, 1, 3, 230849) Seeking assistance of law therefore becomes obligatory for reformers in order to have the anomaly removed, and when the anomaly is removed there will be no question of forcing the entry of Harijans into temples but it would be possible for the majority of those who are under the present usage entitled to enter temples to throw them open to Harijans.
('59', 131, 1, 4, 231201) In that event there can be no question of boycott of temples by the majority.
('59', 131, 1, 5, 231279) There may be a minority who may cease to take advantage of the temples.
('59', 131, 1, 6, 231351) It would be their loss, but I have in my compromise proposal made allowances even for their views or prejudices as I would call them.
('59', 131, 1, 7, 231485) Therefore those in Travancore who believe that untouchability should be removed for the good name of Hinduism will work might and main on the one hand to convert by gentle means and purity of conduct orthodox objectors to their own view and on the other work among the Harijans so as to induce them to shed those habits or customs which are repugnant to the moral sense.
('59', 131, 2, 8, 231856) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('59', 131, 6, 14, 232130) I have not arrived at what I believe to be truth in the analytical way and therefore it is most difficult for me to understand some of your questions.

('59', 132, 1, 3, 232651) I confess that I am very stupid and often cannot account for things I do and beliefs I hold and sometimes I fancy that God is speaking or acting through me.
('59', 132, 1, 4, 232808) I am painfully conscious of the fact that such belief may be merely a figment of my imagination, but while it lasts, believe me, it is as true to me as it is that I am dictating this letter to you.

('59', 133, 4, 7, 234201) DEAR FRIEND, I think we have made a fetish of preservation of the purity of stock through unnatural restrictions.
('59', 133, 4, 8, 234315) The ancients never knew these restrictions.
('59', 133, 4, 9, 234359) This does not mean that I am an advocate of promiscuous unions.
('59', 133, 4, 10, 234423) I think that it is a wise rule to have marriage among people having common thought and common habits of life, but it is a vicious thing when it becomes so rigid as to make a departure from it a sinful act, especially in these days when the varnas have lost their purity, if not their original significance altogether.
('59', 133, 4, 11, 234741) The division between the superior and inferior people that you seem to believe in is, in my opinion, a monstrous perversion of truth.

('59', 134, 14, 20, 236024) January 27, 1933
('59', 134, 15, 21, 236041) Mr. Gandhi said that he was surprised and pained to find that Mr. Iyengar, an
('59', 134, 16, 22, 236119) ex judge, had spoken “so irresponsibly” as he had done.
('59', 134, 16, 23, 236175) 1 If he had taken the trouble
('59', 134, 17, 24, 236205) of studying the movement, he would at once have seen that, with Mr. Gandhi, the
('59', 134, 18, 25, 236285) removal of untouchability was an article of faith before he knew anything of politics.
('59', 134, 19, 26, 236372) If he (Mr. Gandhi) had been guided by political, instead of religious instinct, he would
('59', 134, 20, 27, 236461) have excluded temple entry from the programme and confined his attention to
('59', 134, 21, 28, 236537) economic and educational uplift.
('59', 134, 21, 29, 236570) But he had staked his popularity, such as it was,
('59', 134, 22, 30, 236620) 1 Srinivasa Iyengar was reported to have said at a sanatanist meeting in Madras that the present temple entry movement was but a political stunt of Gandhiji and his followers to placate the Harijans and win them over to the Congress so as to present a united front.
('59', 135, 0, 1, 236886) 136 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 135, 1, 2, 236928) because he believed that without temple entry untouchability could not be said to
('59', 135, 2, 3, 237010) have been abolished from Hinduism.
('59', 135, 2, 4, 237045) Mr. Gandhi added: I make an offer to Mr. Iyengar and other sanatanists who say that they do not wish to ill treat Harijans, and would like to promote their economic and other temporal welfare.
('59', 135, 2, 5, 237238) Let them join the Servants of Untouchables Society and finance and work its programme for temporal uplift and leave temple entry to me and those who think with me.
('59', 135, 2, 6, 237402) Mr. Iyengar should know that the Society contains few Congressmen.
('59', 135, 2, 7, 237469) The organization contains many prominent Liberals.
('59', 135, 2, 8, 237520) Indeed, sanatanists can, if they mean what they say, by bringing money and workers to the Society, take charge of it and shape its policy.
('59', 135, 2, 9, 237659) If this does not suit them, let them run a rival organization and spread its branches all over the country, and win the hearts and gratitude of Harijans.
('59', 135, 2, 10, 237813) I would take my chance of gaining religious merit by prosecuting the temple entry movement and showing that it will, at a stroke, uplift the Harijans and caste Hindus, and purify both and automatically promote the temporal welfare of the former.
('59', 135, 2, 11, 238059) Mr. Iyengar should realize that, in a matter concerning the masses, no stunt can be of much use.
('59', 135, 2, 12, 238156) They are open to be appealed to by everybody, and only honesty and hard work can win in the end.
('59', 135, 3, 13, 238253) As for the charge of religious interference, Gandhiji said: I have already dealt with the question in my previous statements.
('59', 135, 3, 14, 238379) I can only reiterate my view that I myself will be the first person to oppose religious interference by the State even when real power passes to the people.
('59', 135, 3, 15, 238536) But sanatanists cannot have it both ways.
('59', 135, 3, 16, 238578) They would want, as they have done before, the aid of law to sustain what, to one like me, appears to be prejudice or worse; and when I seek to remove that interference, the cry of interference is at once raised by the upholders of prejudice in the name of religion.
('59', 135, 3, 17, 238845) Indeed, I want to respect even prejudice, for I realize what may appear to me prejudice may be enlightenment to others.
('59', 135, 3, 18, 238965) But these are matters where the aid of the law cannot be sought.
('59', 135, 3, 19, 239030) The law can only take a temporal view of the questions that come before it.
('59', 135, 3, 20, 239106) It cannot recognize the Agamas 1
('59', 135, 4, 21, 239139) upholding thieving.
('59', 135, 4, 22, 239159) I have, at the Ashram, neighbours who honestly believe that thieving is an occupation enjoined by God to them as a caste.
('59', 135, 4, 23, 239281) I respect their prejudice, but the law does not.
('59', 135, 4, 24, 239330) I am here not giving a hypothetical case.
('59', 135, 4, 25, 239372) I am quoting from actual experience.

('59', 136, 1, 2, 239467) Mr. Iyengar says that I do not believe in the Shastras.
('59', 136, 1, 3, 239523) He will fail to produce a single statement of mine to support his accusation.
('59', 136, 1, 4, 239601) Surely, he is too good a lawyer to claim infallibility for his interpre tation of the Shastras or his judgment of their authenticity.
('59', 136, 1, 5, 239735) I would ask him and those who are flinging all sorts of charges against me, distorting my writings in order to prove them, whether they will uphold sanatana dharma by such methods.
('59', 136, 1, 6, 239916) Let them believe me when I say that I am quite capable of saying so if I had the slightest desire to found a new religion or a new sect.
('59', 136, 1, 7, 240053) I have no other wish in this world, but to find light, joy and peace through Hinduism.
('59', 136, 1, 8, 240140) It is for that reason that I want to see it purified.
('59', 136, 1, 9, 240194) It satisfies me because, as I have understood and lived it, it has enabled me to treat other religions on a footing of absolute equality and their followers even as my blood brothers and sisters.
('59', 136, 1, 10, 240390) Hinduism and my conception of the Gita, of the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Bhagavata, and the Mahabharata, teach me that all life is one, and that in the eye of God there is no superior and no inferior.
('59', 136, 1, 11, 240592) I am sick of controversy.
('59', 136, 1, 12, 240618) But I am more sick of untruth and impurity.
('59', 136, 1, 13, 240662) I invite sanatanists to join hands with me in fighting them.

('59', 137, 3, 9, 241595) The legal obstruction must be removed.
('59', 137, 3, 10, 241634) We must therefore educate the public on the necessity of the removal of the legal bar, and meanwhile, where there is no obstruction from trustees and the public desire it, temples should be thrown open.
('59', 137, 3, 11, 241837) Our programme, therefore, practically remains as it was, the all India Bill replacing the Madras Bill.

('59', 138, 6, 9, 243495) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('59', 138, 6, 10, 243528) I can only vaguely gather what you are driving at.
('59', 138, 6, 11, 243579) I wish you will adopt a simple style to express simple ideas and give up all metaphor and ornamentation.
('59', 138, 6, 12, 243684) Remember the following: 1. No cause that is backed by truth is ever lost.
('59', 138, 6, 13, 243758) 2. Legislation is required now and will always be required to remove legal obstruction.
('59', 138, 6, 14, 243846) 3. Both hotels and vilasams 1 are bad; both pander to the palate.
('59', 138, 6, 15, 243912) 4. One can be a glutton on vegetarian food and strictly temperate on flesh food which he does not consider forbidden food.
('59', 138, 6, 16, 244035) 5. Virtue lies in abstaining from visiting public eating houses altogether, and even in one’s home, partaking of food as medicine, just enough to sustain the body, and never to please the palate.
('59', 138, 6, 17, 244231) 6. Don’t mix up the loose life of modern times with a very big movement for religious reform.
('59', 138, 7, 18, 244325) Yours sincerely,

('59', 139, 3, 6, 244609) If you are prepared to take over the book, I shall gladly go through the estimates you have received and you will pay no more than the market rate.

('59', 139, 8, 11, 244865) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter and resolution 1. If my compromise is ever accepted by the sanatanist Hindus, you will find that, not only does it not wound the self respect of Harijans, but it actually enhances it; but the matter is just now irrelevant.
('59', 139, 9, 12, 245129) Yours sincerely, THE HON.

('59', 139, 11, 16, 245497) but also wounding to the self respect of the so called Depressed Classes.”

('59', 140, 3, 7, 245783) But if he or anybody has been guilty of action such as you describe you should institute proceedings against them.
('59', 140, 3, 8, 245898) I am sending your letter to Sjt.

('59', 141, 3, 4, 246560) DEAR FRIEND, I have your card.
('59', 141, 3, 5, 246591) I have no objection to my opinion 1 on your article being published, only it must be as addressed to you, for, as a prisoner, I have no right to address letters to editors apart from matters of untouchability.
('59', 141, 3, 6, 246801) As to your article on temple entry, I did go through it when I received it, and I have a recollection that it seemed to me to be reasonable, but I am just now working under a very severe strain and I glance through the literature that I get to an extent just enough for my purpose.
('59', 141, 3, 7, 247083) My opinion therefore has no value when I do not express it as a result of deliberate study.

('59', 141, 8, 12, 247269) NARANDAS, I got your mail 2. I have not received slivers from Chhakkaddas.
('59', 141, 8, 13, 247344) I have written to Maganlal and asked if he can send any.
('59', 141, 8, 14, 247401) If you can send slivers from there without any difficulty, please do so.
('59', 141, 8, 15, 247474) Parachure Shastri and Dastane also are supplied slivers from here, and Mahadev and Chhaganlal give all their time [to spinning].
('59', 141, 8, 16, 247603) Hence making slivers to meet the requirements of five spinners is likely to take a great deal of our time.
('59', 141, 8, 17, 247710) If, however, Chhakkaddas from there cannot supply any, don’t trouble him.
('59', 141, 8, 18, 247784) If Keshu can offer any without inconvenience to himself, you may send them.
('59', 141, 8, 19, 247860) Do you get any letters from Tulsi Maher?
('59', 141, 8, 20, 247901) He doesn’t seem to be making much progress about spinning.
('59', 141, 8, 21, 247960) If you know anything about this or have information, let me know.

('59', 144, 3, 6, 250936) I have already written to you regarding the boys and the girls.
('59', 144, 3, 7, 251000) If the parents approve of the arrangement suggested, make it immediately.

('59', 144, 3, 9, 251190) Mary Barr must have arrived there.
('59', 144, 3, 10, 251225) I would advise you to assign her some teaching work and some work connected with the uplift of Harijans.

('59', 144, 3, 12, 251453) Probably she is accustomed to eating fruits.

('59', 144, 3, 17, 251687) This time my weight was less by two pounds.
('59', 144, 3, 18, 251731) That is, it has gone down from 104 to 102. But my health is quite good otherwise.
('59', 144, 3, 19, 251813) You must have read in the papers about my getting headaches.
('59', 144, 3, 20, 251874) But they were soon cured by mud packs and it is an old story now.

('59', 145, 1, 7, 252715) About Shastri’s suggestion, I shall write to you after he comes here and after I have discussed the whole thing with him.
('59', 145, 1, 8, 252837) Of this I am quite sure, that we shall not want two men of the same level for the English weekly.
('59', 145, 1, 9, 252935) You may tell me what work you were taking or you had intended to take from Shastri.
('59', 145, 1, 10, 253019) You have asked Mahadev to send you about 25 copies of the Hindi translation of the opinion on untouchability of the learned men.
('59', 145, 1, 11, 253148) Mahadev destroyed the copies.
('59', 145, 1, 12, 253178) He has only one or two copies for his file.
('59', 145, 1, 13, 253222) You will therefore have to multiply the copies you have in your possession.
('59', 145, 1, 14, 253298) I wonder if you have carried out all the corrections in the Hindi copy.
('59', 145, 1, 15, 253370) If you are still going to have the opinion in all the principal vernaculars in one cover, I expect you to ensure absolutely correct translation and to see to it that the pamphlet is free from any errors.

('59', 146, 8, 12, 254473) He has really no defence.
('59', 146, 8, 13, 254499) The sub editor at your end made no mistakes at all in carrying out his message.
('59', 146, 8, 14, 254579) But in his own over zeal for the cause, Salivati drew upon his imagination.
('59', 146, 8, 15, 254655) He admits that many things he attributed to me I never said, but he simply inferred from a word here and a word there that had dropped out of my lips that I had meant what he said.
('59', 146, 8, 16, 254836) That of course was very dangerous, but he thought that he would serve the cause by allowing his imagination full play.
('59', 146, 8, 17, 254955) He admits also that I had warned him that he was not to make any use whatsoever of the conversation, but again he thought there was no harm, since the cause was good.
('59', 146, 8, 18, 255122) There was no mala fides behind his action.
('59', 146, 8, 19, 255165) I think and hope that this mistake will last him for the rest of his life.
('59', 146, 8, 20, 255240) Therefore, beyond warning him that he must act purely as a reporter and not at all as a protagonist of a cause, nothing further need be done.
('59', 146, 8, 21, 255382) When one sees so much of indifferent, incompetent and even unscrupulous reporting it would be a pity to punish a mistake, though serious, quite unintentional.
('59', 146, 9, 22, 255541) Yours sincerely, [PS.]

('59', 147, 10, 15, 256276) I enclose today another and that is from Raghunath Shastri Kokaje.
('59', 147, 10, 16, 256343) His essay is not convincing.
('59', 147, 10, 17, 256372) The argument is somewhat loose, and it does not examine the position of the opposite school.
('59', 147, 10, 18, 256465) The Hindi admits of much correcting, which I hope you will see to.
('59', 147, 10, 19, 256532) I have been having regularly cuttings from newspapers from the Aaj office, for which many thanks, and which give me useful indication of what is going on in the Hindi Press.

('59', 148, 2, 3, 256829) January 29, 1933
('59', 148, 3, 4, 256846) DEAR FRIEND, I have your last letter which is undated but which was received yesterday.
('59', 148, 3, 5, 256934) The first part of that letter is a complaint against unseemly behaviour of certain people at the meeting organized by the “followers of sanatana dharma”.
('59', 148, 3, 6, 257088) I was grieved to hear of the incident referred to by you.
('59', 148, 3, 7, 257146) I shall discuss it with Shri Rajagopalachariar who is expected here tomorrow.
('59', 148, 3, 8, 257224) It hurts me whenever there is any rowdyism or untruthfulness on either side.
('59', 148, 3, 9, 257301) Honest differences of opinion there will always be.
('59', 148, 3, 10, 257353) The cause of Truth cannot be served by hard swearing, stone throwing or untruthfulness.
('59', 148, 3, 11, 257441) The second part of your letter relieved the pain caused by the first part owing to the manner in which you approached my argument about untouchability.
('59', 148, 3, 12, 257593) As it so happened, I read your letter aloud amongst us, four prisoners, and I must confess to you that, as I proceeded, I could not help bursting into laughter, in which my companions heartily joined.
('59', 148, 3, 13, 257794) But behind the laughter was also a sadness that you, an agent of sanatana dharma, could not see that religion could not be treated in terms of algebra.
('59', 148, 3, 14, 257946) You have, instead of going straight to the core of my argument, launched out into an irrelevant discourse, ending in a ludicrous algebraical formula.
('59', 148, 3, 15, 258096) You will pardon me for writing straight from the heart.
('59', 148, 3, 16, 258152) Of all the letters that I have been receiving only yours and one or two others that I can mention have been courteous and have attempted to argue cogently.
('59', 148, 3, 17, 258308) I should only return your courtesy and your honest attempt to convince me by giving you an honest reply.
('59', 148, 3, 18, 258413) Let me tell you that all the letters and literature that have come to me have only confirmed me in the opinion that untouchability, as we are practising today, is a big blot upon Hinduism and an atrocious error in which we are still persisting, simply because of our laziness to understand and act up to the very fundamentals of Hinduism.
('59', 148, 3, 19, 258752) This inglorious persistence in error cuts me to the quick, but I am an optimist.
('59', 148, 3, 20, 258833) I have implicit faith in the ultimate victory of Truth.
('59', 148, 3, 21, 258889) I know therefore that untouchability will go and Hinduism will live a purified religion.
('59', 148, 3, 22, 258978) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('59', 149, 3, 4, 259189) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('59', 149, 3, 5, 259222) I cannot recall a single occasion when I called the Mahabharata a heap of rubbish.
('59', 149, 3, 6, 259305) I have not had many occasions to speak or write about the Mahabharata, and when I did write about it I compared it to a diamond mine, whereas I compared the Gita to a diamond chest.
('59', 149, 3, 7, 259487) Perhaps, the Shankaracharya had that simile in mind, but at the present moment, for sanatanists, whether they are big men or small men, any stone is good enough to fling at me.
('59', 149, 4, 8, 259664) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('59', 150, 2, 3, 260222) January 29, 1933
('59', 150, 3, 4, 260239) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter.
('59', 150, 3, 5, 260281) So much untruth, almost bordering on the libellous, is being broadcast at the present moment about me that I should warn you not to believe anything against me unless you have it verified by me or you yourself have verified it from my authentic writings.
('59', 150, 3, 6, 260536) Thus, I have never declared to the world that “the hereditary caste system of the Hindu society is an artificial creation of some designing men”.
('59', 150, 3, 7, 260682) By hereditary system I suppose you mean varnashramadharma.
('59', 150, 3, 8, 260741) If so what I have said and written is that I believe in hereditary varnashramadharma which is one of the gifts that Hinduism has made to the world.
('59', 150, 3, 9, 260889) Again, what I have resisted and what I would resist with my life is untouchability as it is being practised today.
('59', 150, 3, 10, 261004) But I have never said that there is no such thing as untouchability.
('59', 150, 3, 11, 261073) On the contrary, I have said that untouchability of a kind is common to all mankind and all religions and that it is a necessary institution, and in that real sense all mankind become untouchable while they are performing certain functions of nature.
('59', 150, 3, 12, 261324) This is only one instance of natural necessary untouchability, but that carries no sin with it.
('59', 150, 3, 13, 261420) Again, interdining, intermarriage and the like are no part whatsoever of the campaign against untouchability as it is being practised today.
('59', 150, 3, 14, 261561) I have written in favour of interdining and even intermarriage under certain circumstances, but that is wholly irrelevant to the present discussion.
('59', 150, 3, 15, 261710) You can, if you desire to know my views on things not pertaining to untouchability, do so by studying my writings.
('59', 150, 3, 16, 261825) I hope this fully answers your letter.

('59', 152, 17, 23, 264074) All that I can say in this matter is that you should consult your own conscience and fearlessly follow its bidding.

('59', 154, 8, 15, 266412) It is certainly good that you intend to seek the advice and help of Dhurandear.
('59', 154, 8, 16, 266492) Let me know what exactly is.
('59', 154, 8, 17, 266521) Madan also runs a ‘Health Home’ or some such thing.
('59', 154, 8, 18, 266573) Get acquainted with it with the help of Bhai Khambhatta.
('59', 154, 8, 19, 266630) His address is 275 Hornby Road.
('59', 154, 8, 20, 266662) We have close relations with him and he is a very good man.
('59', 154, 8, 21, 266722) I want you to come and see me after you have spent some time there or if you find that the place does not agree with you.

('59', 154, 14, 26, 266958) RAMA (JOSHI), May I describe your letter, received after a long interval, as a favour?
('59', 154, 14, 27, 267045) Chhaganlal takes down the letters which I dictate, looks after files and puts every letter in its proper file, prepares dates for me to eat, etc., etc.
('59', 154, 14, 28, 267197) He is learning the Gita by heart and trying to improve his

('59', 155, 1, 3, 267311) He is also trying to put on weight.
('59', 155, 1, 4, 267347) I have already written to you that he has succeeded somewhat in this.
('59', 155, 1, 5, 267417) All four of us take a walk every morning and evening.
('59', 155, 1, 6, 267471) You need not, therefore, worry about Chhaganlal at all.
('59', 155, 1, 7, 267527) Tell this to Vimu also.
('59', 155, 1, 8, 267551) If even then she continues to worry you about her father, tell her that I would then not call her a sensible girl.
('59', 155, 1, 9, 267666) I should like her to say: “If father’s body and mind improve and become stronger, let him remain in jail.
('59', 155, 1, 10, 267772) I will endure separation from him.”

('59', 156, 9, 13, 269219) BHAI MOOLCHAND (i) The varna system proper is no longer in practice and there are no varnas like the Bhangi or the Chamars.
('59', 156, 9, 14, 269343) If we have to make a proper division we have to take into consideration the qualities of each individual.

('59', 156, 12, 22, 269924) (iii) As removal of untouchability is the goal, should not people interdine with the Harijans?
('59', 156, 12, 23, 270019) (iv) You are indifferent on the subject of yajnopavit [sacred thread].
('59', 156, 12, 24, 270090) Nevertheless, if Brahmis, Vaishyas and others can wear yajopavit, can Bhangis and Chamars too wear it?

('59', 157, 3, 4, 270338) I have settled amongst you since 1915. I have often spoken to you on untouchability.
('59', 157, 3, 5, 270423) You have often condemned it and promised to give it up.
('59', 157, 3, 6, 270479) Fulfil this promise or .

('59', 157, 3, 8, 270534) I have used the word ‘so called’ purposely.
('59', 157, 3, 9, 270578) I do not believe in high or low.
('59', 157, 3, 10, 270611) Religion teaches that he who believes himself high commits a sin.
('59', 157, 3, 11, 270677) God creates various classes, but does not make any class high or low.

('59', 157, 3, 13, 270786) I have been subjected to abuse.

('59', 157, 3, 16, 270911) Those who serve have been always treated like that.

('59', 157, 7, 23, 271177) That is, you will be admitted to public temples on the same conditions as other Hindus, but devotees of God should be as clean as possible internally and externally.

('59', 158, 3, 5, 271820) No sooner you leave the shores of India, my complaints start.
('59', 158, 3, 6, 271882) Sita’s boils must have disappeared as soon as the ship had left the shore.
('59', 158, 3, 7, 271957) I hope your work has become smoother.
('59', 158, 3, 8, 271995) Let me know what arrangements you have finally made.
('59', 158, 3, 9, 272048) If you wish to live happily and preserve your reputation, pay off the debt soon and never borrow money again.
('59', 158, 3, 10, 272158) One should not incur a debt even for the sake of one’s father.
('59', 158, 3, 11, 272221) One may give one’s life for him, but not forsake one’s dharma, and incurring a debt is as good as forsaking dharma.
('59', 158, 3, 12, 272337) I am all right.
('59', 158, 3, 13, 272353) I do not know whether or when I shall have to fast, but I am sure of this, that I will fast only if, and when, God prompts me.
('59', 158, 3, 14, 272480) If you believe me when I say this, you will not be upset and will not be anxious to come running here.
('59', 158, 3, 15, 272583) You should leave South Africa when you feel beyond doubt that it is your duty to do so.
('59', 158, 3, 16, 272671) Till then, your duty is to remain there and do what service you can.
('59', 158, 3, 17, 272740) You should live as if at present your country was South Africa.
('59', 158, 3, 18, 272804) You should preserve the utmost simplicity in your life except in regard to things which may be necessary for conforming to the standard of life there.
('59', 158, 3, 19, 272955) Do not discontinue the daily recitation of the Gita; Chapter XII is in fact your spiritual food in the journey of life.
('59', 158, 3, 20, 273075) Not only should you be able to recite the verses from memory but they should have also sunk into your heart.
('59', 158, 3, 21, 273184) If they have, you will find that they contain the essence of all Shastras.
('59', 158, 3, 22, 273259) Did I write to you that Chhaganlal Joshi was with me?
('59', 158, 3, 23, 273313) We are all well.

('59', 159, 3, 5, 273876) Two of them do not help one much to understand you but I did get something from the third.
('59', 159, 3, 6, 273967) I liked it.
('59', 159, 3, 7, 273979) The speeches would have told me more about you if the dates of all of them had been given.
('59', 159, 3, 8, 274070) I will now try to glance through some of your books which have been received here and, if I feel like it, will write to you about them.
('59', 159, 3, 9, 274206) You have aroused my interest.

('59', 159, 3, 13, 274412) I saw your scheme for the high school.
('59', 159, 3, 14, 274451) It was shown to me by Bhai Multi.
('59', 159, 3, 15, 274485) You must be aware that the High Court’s order includes primary education.
('59', 159, 3, 16, 274559) Despite that, why have you decided to start only a high school?
('59', 159, 3, 17, 274623) And even in the high school I see that you have given place only to pupils drawn from a higher social level.
('59', 159, 3, 18, 274732) Think over the following points and let me have your views: 1. What is meant by “high class Hindus”?
('59', 159, 3, 19, 274833) 2. Does not the clause of the will under which you have framed your scheme also include primary education?
('59', 159, 3, 20, 274940) 3. If it does, why have you excluded primary education?
('59', 159, 3, 21, 274996) 4. Don’t you think that you have made the hostel of the high school very expensive?
('59', 159, 3, 22, 275080) 5. What place have you given to the mother tongue in your scheme?
('59', 159, 3, 23, 275146) 6. Does the phrase “for high class Hindus” mean that the untouchable communities cannot take advantage of the high school?
('59', 159, 3, 24, 275269) I have heard of a case in which it was ruled that, if an institution was established for a particular class, there was no bar to the admission of other classes if they could be admitted without injury to the interests of the former and if that class did not raise any objection to these others being admitted.
('59', 159, 3, 25, 275579) I hope you are all right.
('59', 159, 3, 26, 275605) If you cannot write with either of the two hands, you need not write yourself.

('59', 160, 7, 11, 276106) It must be carried out now.
('59', 160, 7, 12, 276134) Be firm and carry it out.
('59', 160, 7, 13, 276160) If we do not act thus, the Ashram cannot go on.
('59', 160, 7, 14, 276208) Its good requires that the decision should be carried out.
('59', 160, 7, 15, 276267) Be firm in talking with Ramji also.
('59', 160, 7, 16, 276303) Discuss his problem with all the others, and call him when you do so.
('59', 160, 7, 17, 276373) We should act towards him in the same way as you would towards me or I towards you in similar circumstances.
('59', 160, 7, 18, 276482) The path of ahimsa is like a razor’s edge.
('59', 160, 7, 19, 276525) Everybody in the Ashram should realize that the institution does not exist for him or her, but that it exists in order to train all the inmates for service, to teach them to offer themselves as sacrifice in the yajna of self purification.
('59', 160, 7, 20, 276764) There can be no room in it for selfish objectives.
('59', 160, 7, 21, 276815) Why didn’t Santok go with Radhika?
('59', 160, 7, 22, 276850) Who will look after her?

('59', 161, 10, 16, 278065) I thank you for your letter of 21st instant.
('59', 161, 10, 17, 278110) I do not recollect having received yours of the 16th November last.
('59', 161, 10, 18, 278178) In reply to your elaborate argument I can only commend to your attention the various statements that I have been issuing from time to time.
('59', 161, 10, 19, 278318) The more I study the question and the literature that correspondents send me, the more deeply I become convinced that there is absolutely no warrant in the Shastras for untouchability as we practise it today.
('59', 161, 10, 20, 278527) He who runs may read the signs of the times and see that it is crumbling to pieces even as it is.
('59', 161, 10, 21, 278625) Is it not better that we should deliberately destroy it and purify Hinduism?
('59', 161, 10, 22, 278702) Its destruction merely through its own weakness will leave Hinduism weaker.

('59', 162, 6, 8, 279086) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter of 24th instant for which I thank you.
('59', 162, 6, 9, 279157) The extract from my article of 1920 seems to be quite correct though I have no means of verifying it.
('59', 162, 6, 10, 279259) But I should repeat the ideas contained in that extract even today word for word, and I repeated the same thing to Sjt.

('59', 162, 11, 19, 279746) DEAR KALI BABOO, It was a matter of great joy to me to receive your letter describing the activities of Santiniketan and Sriniketan in the service of the Harijans.
('59', 162, 11, 20, 279910) My heart felt congratulations to you for the solid work you are doing.
('59', 162, 11, 21, 279981) I note that you are presently holding a district conference of the Harijans of Birbhum.
('59', 162, 11, 22, 280069) I hope that that would result in a great wave of

('59', 163, 5, 8, 280409) January 31, 1933
('59', 163, 6, 9, 280426) DEAR BABOOJI, The shorter form is more affectionate than the longer.
('59', 163, 6, 10, 280495) way I use it as such.
('59', 163, 6, 11, 280517) I wish I could induce you to follow my rule—not to publish a newspaper unless it becomes self supporting.
('59', 163, 6, 12, 280623) If the public want a newspaper, they should pay for it, and when it does not pay for itself, it shows that it is not wanted.
('59', 163, 6, 13, 280748) For such a paper naturally there are no advertisements.
('59', 163, 6, 14, 280804) There is no padding.
('59', 163, 6, 15, 280825) It contains only that which the editor cannot help giving and the staff of such newspapers will also be chosen for its spirit of self sacrifice.
('59', 163, 6, 16, 280970) You at least may not be party to a paper that exists on charity.
('59', 163, 6, 17, 281035) Of course you will throw these ideas in the waste paper basket of your mind if you have any rigid notions about the conduct of newspapers and if these ideas find no echo in you.
('59', 163, 6, 18, 281213) I take it that as editor of the supplement you have every right to add your own comments to any of the opinions you may be publishing in the supplement.
('59', 163, 6, 19, 281366) I am now torturing my brain and heart to yield to me the right method of dealing with the situation that has arisen from the Viceregal decision.
('59', 163, 6, 20, 281511) My statement is but the prelude to the action that is developing.
('59', 163, 6, 21, 281577) The suggestion you make does not appear to me to be practical in the sense that the people require prolonged training for its adoption.
('59', 163, 6, 22, 281713) The vast mass of those who are today in the habit of attending temples fervently believe in darshan and its spiritual benefit.
('59', 163, 6, 23, 281840) They will not deny to themselves a spiritual benefit for the sake of
('59', 164, 0, 1, 281909) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 165
('59', 164, 1, 2, 281954) others who might be deprived of it and from their own standpoint they will be right.
('59', 164, 1, 3, 282039) If they could be persuaded to believe that there can be no spiritual benefit to be derived from a temple whose trustees perpetuate injustice, it would be a different thing.
('59', 164, 1, 4, 282212) That is the lesson we are trying to drive home, but we have not yet succeeded to the extent we would like to.
('59', 164, 1, 5, 282322) I never knew that Sri Prakasa was a stickler for the proper spelling of his name in the Roman character.
('59', 164, 1, 6, 282427) 1 His name in Devanagari can only be spelt in one way.
('59', 164, 1, 7, 282482) Rendered in a character with defective phonetics, it cannot be a matter of much consequence how it is spelt.
('59', 164, 1, 8, 282591) However I shall respect his weakness.
('59', 164, 1, 9, 282629) I had a letter some time ago from Shivaprasad which led me to think that he was making steady headway.
('59', 164, 1, 10, 282732) But your letter seems to point the other way.
('59', 164, 1, 11, 282778) I would therefore like you to give me an accurate account about him when Sri Prakasa returns.
('59', 164, 1, 12, 282872) Of course if you can get the permission for the publication of my opinion of your book, if I succeed in sending one, I should have no objection whatsoever.
('59', 164, 1, 13, 283028) Of course my private letters do find their way to the Press.
('59', 164, 1, 14, 283089) That’s no concern of mine.
('59', 164, 1, 15, 283116) What I have to guard against is sending of opinions on books for publication or messages to newspapers for publication apart from untouchability.
('59', 164, 2, 16, 283262) Yours sincerely,

('59', 164, 5, 19, 283342) January 31, 1933
('59', 164, 6, 20, 283359) DEAR HARIJI, I have your letter of the 26th instant.
('59', 164, 6, 21, 283412) If you will look up my telegram about Lakshmanshastri 2, you will find that it was accurate enough.
('59', 164, 6, 22, 283512) You got the telegram at 10.45 p.m.
('59', 164, 6, 23, 283547) The next day began after midnight.
('59', 164, 6, 24, 283582) Therefore Lakshmanshastri was reaching there, as he did, at 2 a.m.
('59', 164, 6, 25, 283649) following 10.45 p.m.
('59', 164, 6, 26, 283670) I would not however have bothered you about this, as it was quite a small matter, if I did not want to write to

('59', 165, 1, 2, 283975) you about the defeat of the Harijan candidates.
('59', 165, 2, 3, 284023) This defeat makes me sad.
('59', 165, 2, 4, 284049) I would not trouble you to enquire again into the matter.
('59', 165, 2, 5, 284107) But I cannot help owning to you my utter stupidity.
('59', 165, 2, 6, 284159) I had fondly believed, I suppose quite without any warrant, that Harijan candidates will have a walk over at elections, especially in the beginning stages.
('59', 165, 2, 7, 284315) I see, however, that without reservation they would have a poor chance of being elected unless caste Hindus develop a high sense of honour or unless Harijans are overwhelmingly represented on the voters, list, but where there is neither honour nor overwhelming representation on the voters’ list, reservation seems to be their only safety.
('59', 165, 2, 8, 284655) This Cawnpore election opens my eyes as nothing else before did, and I can now appreciate the force of the summary rejection by Dr. Ambedkar of any convention.
('59', 165, 2, 9, 284815) Nothing but statutory reservation would satisfy him, and it may be that we shall have to have statutory reservation everywhere as fit punishment for our selfishness.
('59', 165, 2, 10, 284981) In order to avert a calamity of such a nature descending upon us, if I had my way, I would right this evil by three caste Hindus vacating their seats and allowing three Harijans to be elected.
('59', 165, 2, 11, 285174) It would be a striking demonstration of our ability to repair wrongs if the defeat of Harijan candidates was a striking demonstration of our selfishness.
('59', 165, 2, 12, 285328) You may make whatever use you like of this letter.
('59', 165, 2, 13, 285379) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('59', 167, 9, 18, 287625) THE PRIVATE SECRETARY TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE VICEROY NEW DELHI
('59', 167, 10, 19, 287687) DEAR SIR, On the 30th December I sent you a telegram 1 for submission to His Excellency on the question of what is known as Dr. Subbaroyan’s Bill regarding temple entry.
('59', 167, 10, 20, 287857) I have had no acknowledgement of it, formal or otherwise.
('59', 167, 10, 21, 287915) Nevertheless I deem it my duty to make my submission to His Excellency on the decision just announced regarding Sjt.
('59', 167, 10, 22, 288032) Ranga Iyer’s Bills.
('59', 167, 10, 23, 288052) Though I feel that it would have served the cause of humanity better, in point of time, if Dr. Subbaroyan’s Bill had been allowed, I feel thankful that sanction has been granted for the introduction of Sjt.
('59', 167, 10, 24, 288259) Ranga Iyer’s Bills, one of which is drawn after Dr. Subbaroyan’s disallowed Bill.
('59', 167, 10, 25, 288341) My purpose in addressing this submission is to invite His Excellency’s attention to some considerations that warrant helpful

('59', 168, 0, 1, 288527) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 169
('59', 168, 1, 2, 288572) action by the Government of India regarding the consideration of the Bills by the Assembly at as early a date as is consistent with the importance of the object of the Bills.
('59', 168, 1, 3, 288747) Not knowing the procedure of the Assembly, I sought Sjt.
('59', 168, 1, 4, 288804) M.R. Jayakar’s assistance and guidance which he very kindly gave me yesterday.
('59', 168, 1, 5, 288883) He told me that the Government, if they wished, could make it possible to pass one at least of the Bills during the ensuing session of the Assembly.
('59', 168, 1, 6, 289032) If such is the case, I would urge that the Government are morally bound to give such assistance as may be necessary for the speedy consideration of the measures.
('59', 168, 1, 7, 289194) By the acceptance of the Yeravda Pact relating to the representation of the ‘depressed classes’, now commonly described as ‘Harijans’, in the legislatures, they bound themselves morally to facilitate as far as it lay in their power the observance by caste Hindus of all the other conditions of the Pact, which had reference to social and religious matters.
('59', 168, 1, 8, 289551) Inasmuch as His Majesty’s Government endorsed the legislative part of the Pact, they recognized the representative character of the Conference that passed the various resolutions.
('59', 168, 1, 9, 289731) One of them is as follows: 1
('59', 168, 2, 10, 289760) It is in due fulfilment of the pledge thus given to the Harijans that the Bills have been brought.
('59', 168, 2, 11, 289859) They are necessary inasmuch as the English Law of Trusts bars the progress of reform in the shape of opening temples to the Harijans.
('59', 168, 2, 12, 289993) I am advised that the decisions of British Courts hold it a breach of trust by a trustee who would open temples contrary to the usage prevailing at the time of his entering upon his trust.
('59', 168, 2, 13, 290182) Therefore it is not open either to the trustees or the congregations of the numerous Hindu temples even if they so wished to admit Harijans if usage shows, as it would show, that the general body of Hindu temples are not open to them on the same terms as to the caste Hindus.
('59', 168, 2, 14, 290458) But for decisions based on the English Law of Trusts it would be possible for Hindu pandits and the laity to vary the custom and introduce reforms.
('59', 168, 2, 15, 290606) The Bills are designed to remove this obstacle to progress and restore the condition that existed prior to the decisions referred to above.
('59', 168, 2, 16, 290746) His Excellency may not know that cases have already occurred in which Harijans have been fined for entering temples in good faith
('59', 168, 3, 17, 290876) 1 This is not reproduced here.

('59', 169, 1, 2, 291031) and for the sole object of offering worship.
('59', 169, 1, 3, 291076) Hindu religious usage warrants no such punishment.
('59', 169, 1, 4, 291127) It enjoins purification of the idol and the temple and prescribes purification of caste Hindus in the shape of a bath, but no punishment of the offending worshipper.
('59', 169, 1, 5, 291293) Until therefore the Bills are passed or an equivalent is found by the Government, the vital part of the Hindu pledge cannot be performed.
('59', 169, 1, 6, 291431) For me, personally, holding my life as hostage for the due and timely fulfilment of the pledge, an indefinite prolongation of the impediment is an intolerable agony.
('59', 169, 1, 7, 291597) And as a prisoner I have, I feel, a right to seek Government’s active assistance.
('59', 169, 1, 8, 291679) I ask for no State interference in religious matters.
('59', 169, 1, 9, 291733) I am personally opposed to it.
('59', 169, 1, 10, 291764) In the present case what is sought is to remove the existing State interference.
('59', 169, 1, 11, 291845) I hesitate to point out how the Government can help the introduction and consideration of the Bills.
('59', 169, 1, 12, 291946) It would be presumption on my part to make any such attempt.
('59', 169, 1, 13, 292007) I hope however that I have shown sufficiently clearly that this is a case for the Government of India to facilitate the progress and passage of the Bills in every way legitimately open to them.
('59', 169, 1, 14, 292201) Though I have shown this to some friends, I am not sending it to the Press.

('59', 169, 5, 18, 292369) MY DEAR CHARLIE, I enclose herewith copy of my letter to the Viceroy on the Bills whose introduction he has just sanctioned.
('59', 169, 5, 19, 292494) I take it that you have already seen my statement on the first Bill.
('59', 169, 5, 20, 292563) I have not issued any public statement on the sanction for introducing a Bill which is almost a copy of Dr. Subbaroyan’s Bill, except that it is meant now for the Assembly instead of the Madras Council.
('59', 169, 5, 21, 292766) It is feared that the Bills, although formal sanction for their introduction has been given, will be shelved unless the Government are helpful and even anxious that the Bills should be considered by the Assembly during the session that

('59', 170, 1, 3, 293162) You will see my argument in my letter to the Viceroy.
('59', 170, 1, 4, 293216) So far as I can judge, it is a conclusive argument making it a moral obligation on the part of the Government to facilitate the immediate consideration of the Bills.
('59', 170, 1, 5, 293382) The telegram referred to in my letter to the Viceroy was a long argument urging that sanction should be given for introduction of Dr. Subbaroyan’s Bill as early as possible.

('59', 171, 9, 18, 295304) 2 I shall make use of your services for untouchability work, but since you have offered yourself, body, soul, and mind for that service, after consultation with Sjt.

('59', 171, 9, 20, 295657) Experience at the Ashram would enable you to come in touch with the variety of workers and the manner in which Harijan service is being organized.
('59', 171, 9, 21, 295804) I mention nothing as to your remuneration because, if I understand you rightly, you want nothing more than what may be needed for the sustenance of the body.
('59', 171, 9, 22, 295962) That may be fixed up after you have had your time at the Ashram.

('59', 172, 4, 10, 296619) BIDHAN, I have your letter.
('59', 172, 4, 11, 296647) 1 Ghanshyamdas is here and he will be able to tell you something about what happened in Bombay, for I had no knowledge of the composition of the Conference.
('59', 172, 4, 12, 296804) I have simply concerned myself with the Pact purely from the Harijan point of view, for I assumed as an axiom that whatever was good for Harijans was necessarily good for caste Hindus and that too much good can never be given to Harijans.
('59', 172, 4, 13, 297043) So far as the question of separate electorate is concerned, for my purpose the scheme of the Pact bears no analogy to the separate electorate provided for in the Government scheme.
('59', 172, 4, 14, 297224) That caste Hindus have no voice in the selection of candidates cannot be a matter for complaint.
('59', 172, 4, 15, 297321) The election of one out of four candidates selected by Harijans leaves a wide range of choice for caste Hindu voters cum Harijan voters.
('59', 172, 4, 16, 297458) However, you will please let me know the progress of events there.
('59', 172, 4, 17, 297525) I wonder if Kamala will be fully restored to health so as to enable her to do active work.
('59', 172, 4, 18, 297616) Thank you also for Abdul Alim’s case.
('59', 172, 4, 19, 297654) I hope the young man has already been admitted to the Refuge.

('59', 175, 4, 16, 302593) Do you mean that the Harijan employees in the B.B.& C.I. Railway Workshops are admitted to temples, the temple authorities and the caste Hindu worshippers well knowing that they are Harijans, or, do you imply that they being well dressed pass unnoticed?
('59', 175, 4, 17, 302847) Measures are being taken everywhere to introduce clean ways of living among Harijans.

('59', 176, 3, 4, 303602) MY DEAR GOPALA MENON, I have your letter.
('59', 176, 3, 5, 303644) Satyagraha regarding Guruvayur in the old style is not to be thought of just now.
('59', 176, 3, 6, 303726) We must for the moment concentrate upon the passing of legislation and educating public opinion in favour of complete removal of untouchability and in getting those temples opened which are private properties or about which both the trustees and the public are agreed.
('59', 176, 3, 7, 303995) Therefore our programme should be threefold: Firstly, meetings all over the country urging the Government of India to provide all facilities in their power for the introduction and consideration of the two Bills and appealing to the members of the House generally not to obstruct the passage of the Bills, regarding them as measures demanded by the dictates of humanity and non interference with anybody’s private faith, and appealing to the Hindu members to vote solidly for the measures so as to leave Hindu conscience complete freedom of action regarding untouchability.
('59', 176, 3, 8, 304569) Secondly, you have to carry on house to house propaganda amongst caste Hindus and induce them to show in a concrete manner that they have ceased to believe in untouchability as it is practised today.
('59', 176, 3, 9, 304769) Thirdly, propaganda should be carried on amongst Harijans with reference to the observance of the laws of cleanliness and abstention from food and drink forbidden by Hinduism.
('59', 176, 3, 10, 304945) And all this work should be carried on by men of character who have a living faith in Hinduism.
('59', 176, 4, 11, 305041) Yours sincerely,

('59', 177, 1, 2, 305129) 265. LETTER TO DEVDAS GANDHI
('59', 177, 2, 3, 305158) February 2, 1933
('59', 177, 3, 4, 305175) DEVDAS, I read your speeches in Hindi and English.
('59', 177, 3, 5, 305226) You have expressed yourself well in both languages.
('59', 177, 3, 6, 305278) Every speech is short and full of thoughts and most of the suggestions are useful.
('59', 177, 3, 7, 305361) It is difficult to say to what degree the reform of Hindi is possible.
('59', 177, 3, 8, 305432) Many languages have irregular genders for inanimate objects and this cannot be changed.
('59', 177, 3, 9, 305520) There must have been some rule originally behind this phenomenon.
('59', 177, 3, 10, 305586) The difficulty is felt only by those to whom the language is not their mother tongue, and should be accepted as unavoidable.
('59', 177, 3, 11, 305711) The reform suggested by you involves a change in the basic structure of the language and seems impossible, at present at any rate.
('59', 177, 3, 12, 305842) There has been no instance of a language which was simplified by a deliberate effort in such manner.
('59', 177, 3, 13, 305943) A common script for all the languages would probably save some effort in learning them.
('59', 177, 3, 14, 306031) But this is a question which concerns the science of the study of languages.
('59', 177, 3, 15, 306108) I wanted to refer only to the beauty of expression in your speeches.
('59', 177, 3, 16, 306177) Have you studied Tamil and acquired any proficiency in it?
('59', 177, 3, 17, 306236) We could not talk much and you did not come again.
('59', 177, 3, 18, 306287) But don’t mind.
('59', 177, 3, 19, 306303) You have congenial company at present and so I do not worry on your account.
('59', 177, 3, 20, 306380) Now that you are in Delhi, send me the Urdu books which you were to send and one small dictionary in which I can find the spellings of words without difficulty.
('59', 177, 3, 21, 306541) It should preferably be a combined Urdu English and English Urdu dictionary.
('59', 177, 3, 22, 306618) One book on grammar.
('59', 177, 3, 23, 306639) And any other books which you may like.
('59', 177, 3, 24, 306679) Write to me often.

('59', 178, 1, 2, 306787) 266. INTERVIEW TO ASSOCIATED PRESS
('59', 178, 2, 3, 306822) February 2, 1933
('59', 178, 3, 4, 306839) Interviewed by the Associated Press, Mahatma Gandhi expressed pleasure that
('59', 178, 4, 5, 306915) Mr. Ranga Iyer’s second Bill, which is virtually a copy of Dr. Subbaroyan’s Bill, has
('59', 178, 5, 6, 307001) received the Viceregal sanction.
('59', 178, 5, 7, 307034) He continued: I can only hope that every facility will be offered for the imme diate consideration of these measures by the Assembly.
('59', 178, 5, 8, 307168) Though they are private Bills, they are measures of all India importance and, from a humanitarian standpoint, of world importance.
('59', 178, 5, 9, 307299) I hope that members of the Assembly have no difficulty in recognizing that the Bills constitute no interference with anybody’s religion, whatever is being said to the contrary in utter disregard of the facts.
('59', 178, 5, 10, 307508) The Bills are necessary, if the State is to observe the strictest religious neutrality.
('59', 178, 5, 11, 307596) Both the Bills are simply designed to remove impediments in the path of progress and do not coerce anybody or alter any religious custom or usage.
('59', 178, 6, 12, 307743) Replying to another question regarding the chances of the introduction of the Bills in the Assembly this session itself on which Mahatma Gandhi had been seeking information from prominent persons, he stated that he could say on authority of those who had been members of the Assembly, it was perfectly possible not only for the Bills to be introduced, but if members desired it, the Bills would become law.
('59', 178, 6, 13, 308150) It was quite possible for the Government and members at least to afford reasonable facilities for the introduction of the Bills this session.
('59', 178, 7, 14, 308292) Asked for his views on the suggestion that the Bills should be circulated for eliciting public opinion, Gandhiji said: I can only hope that no such procedure will be adopted, because the question underlying the measure is in no sense new and the Bills contain no complicated sections which may be difficult to understand.
('59', 178, 7, 15, 308614) Opinion of different individuals and groups of parties is also well known.
('59', 178, 7, 16, 308689) Therefore, circulation of the Bills means, to me, a mere dilatory procedure.
('59', 178, 8, 17, 308766) Asked if any definite programme has been chalked out as a result of his
('59', 178, 9, 18, 308838) conversation with Messrs Birla, Rajagopalachariar and others, Gandhiji said that
('59', 178, 10, 19, 308919) they had compared notes and tried to understand the implications in the Viceregal
('59', 178, 11, 20, 309001) sanction for the introduction of the Bills as all India measures.
('59', 178, 11, 21, 309067) They had debated on
('59', 178, 12, 22, 309087) the method to be adopted for consolidating public opinion and for demonstrating the
('59', 179, 0, 1, 309171) 180 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 179, 1, 2, 309213) sincerity of the sanatanists.
('59', 179, 1, 3, 309243) There was no essential difference between them and
('59', 179, 2, 4, 309294) reformers, and the latter did not revolutionize religious customs or flout Shastras.
('59', 179, 3, 5, 309379) It was felt that the sanatanist agitation was largley due to the refusal of the sanatanists to appreciate the reformer’s point of view, and the suspicion that more lay at the bottom of the movement for the removal of untouchability than was stated in their programme.
('59', 179, 3, 6, 309647) It was, therefore, recognized that propaganda for enlightening the public should be continued and workers should be advised not to engage in vain debating but confine themselves to placing the issues in the clearest possible manner.

('59', 179, 6, 10, 309961) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter enclosing your questions.
('59', 179, 6, 11, 310028) I return the questions with answers given against them.
('59', 179, 7, 12, 310084) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('59', 179, 8, 14, 310158) QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
('59', 179, 9, 15, 310180) Q. The report of the Hide Cess Committee, vide copy enclosed, states that the
('59', 179, 10, 16, 310258) depressed classes and the peasantry would derive much benefit from the development of the tanning industry and incidentally refers to the existing appalling waste.
('59', 179, 10, 17, 310422) Can this statement be accepted entirely in respect of unslaughtered cattle hides?
('59', 179, 10, 18, 310504) If it can be, how should the development be brought about so as to yield maximum benefit to the depressed classes and to the peasantry?
('59', 179, 11, 19, 310640) A. It can.
('59', 179, 11, 20, 310651) The development can be brought about only by teaching the classes concerned simple but scientific methods fitted for individuals and villages of lifting carcasses at the places where the cattle die and of treating every part in an economic manner excluding the use of meat for food.
('59', 179, 12, 21, 310934) Q. Should tanning of unslaughtered hides be taken up in India to the exclusion of slaughtered hides or only as an industry mixed up with that of slaughtered hides as at the present stage?
('59', 179, 12, 22, 311122) Is it in any way derogatory for caste Hindus to take up this industry as a profession?
('59', 180, 0, 1, 311209) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 181
('59', 180, 1, 2, 311254) A. I should love to have tanning of the unslaughtered hides as a separate industry distinct from that of slaughtered hides.
('59', 180, 1, 3, 311378) In my opinion it is not derogatory or irreligious for caste Hindus to take up this industry.
('59', 180, 1, 4, 311471) It is essential for the purpose of cow protection that this industry be developed as an aid to cow protection and therefore on philanthropic lines.
('59', 180, 2, 5, 311619) Q. Would not the tanning of unslaughtered cattle hides on a large scale by modern scientific methods be helpful to the following?
('59', 180, 2, 6, 311749) (a) Economic uplift of Harijan brethren and an immediate item of programme of work for the Servants of Untouchables Society.
('59', 180, 2, 7, 311874) (b) Improvement of the living wealth of the country.
('59', 180, 2, 8, 311927) (c) The creation of a new field of activity for the educated unemployed.
('59', 180, 2, 9, 312000) (d) Protection of cows.
('59', 180, 3, 10, 312024) A. I have my doubts.
('59', 180, 3, 11, 312045) Home or village tanning is necessary.
('59', 180, 4, 12, 312083) Q. The unslaughtered cattle hides can be tanned to near perfection of the slaughtered ones.
('59', 180, 4, 13, 312175) Is your information to the contrary?
('59', 180, 5, 14, 312212) A. I believe that this is only partly true, if the carcass is taken up immediately after death and removed so as not to damage the hide.
('59', 180, 6, 15, 312349) Q. In the manufacture of leather goods, particularly shoes, difficulty is being experienced in providing lining which is to be thin and delicate.
('59', 180, 6, 16, 312495) Such a leather is only available from the skins of live sheep and goat.
('59', 180, 6, 17, 312567) Since Hindu India in a fair number is a flesh eater would it go against the principles of the industry of unslaughtered hides to utilize the skins for lining and other purposes of such sheep and goats as are unavoidably killed for food?
('59', 180, 7, 18, 312804) A. Much as I should like to answer otherwise, I believe that for the majority of Hindus the use of the skins of goats and sheep slaughtered for food will not offend their religious sense.
('59', 180, 8, 19, 312992) Q. In the event of the Agra Tannery at Agra restricting its activities to the tanning of unslaughtered hides exclusively, may the Tannery expect your blessings and distinguished patronage?
('59', 180, 9, 20, 313181) A. Any tannery restricting its activities as suggested would certainly receive my blessings if it is run on the lines suggested by me, but whoever does so should realize that in the initial stages he might have to lose.
('59', 180, 9, 21, 313401) I can say nothing of distinguished patronage.

('59', 181, 8, 11, 314090) February 3, 1933
('59', 181, 9, 12, 314107) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter for which I thank you.
('59', 181, 9, 13, 314162) 1 In every case where there has been resistance offered by prostration, whether in front of a temple or elsewhere, I have condemned it as being contrary to the rule of satyagraha.
('59', 181, 9, 14, 314342) For, satyagraha requires suffering in one’s own person, not offering physical resistance to another which prostration undoubt edly does.
('59', 181, 9, 15, 314479) Being the author of satyagraha I have endeavoured to lay down certain rules for the guidance of those who recognize my autho rity, but as I claim no monopoly of the knowledge of the doctrine of satyagraha, it is open to anyone to give what meaning he likes to satyagraha and lay down rules also according to his liking.
('59', 181, 9, 16, 314799) My letter to the President of the League in Ellore has only a limited application.
('59', 181, 9, 17, 314882) The word ‘dodge’ is to be taken in its dictionary meaning.
('59', 181, 9, 18, 314941) I never knew it to bear the meaning of tramping over any person.
('59', 181, 9, 19, 315006) Once Pandit Malaviyaji ‘dodged’ to the amusement of the public and to the discomfiture of the so called satyagrahi students
('59', 181, 10, 20, 315130) 1 The addressee had asked why it could not be called a satyagraha and could be “dodged” if four or five orthodox Brahmins prostrated themselves in front of a temple and peacefully resisted any attempt to allow untouchables in the temple.

('59', 182, 1, 3, 315589) Not one of the prostrating brotherhood was in any shape or form injured or molested, and, if my recollection serves me right, the prostrating ones admired Malaviyaji’s non violent resourcefulness.
('59', 182, 1, 4, 315786) But that was only one way of dodging.
('59', 182, 1, 5, 315824) The dictionary says you can make a dodge behind, around, under, between or into what will hide one.
('59', 182, 1, 6, 315924) But you will recognize that all these dodgings exclude violence.

('59', 182, 5, 11, 316122) [February 3, 1933] 1
('59', 182, 6, 12, 316143) NARANDAS, I got your letter.
('59', 182, 6, 13, 316172) must have got my letter regarding Mahavir and the family must have left now.
('59', 182, 6, 14, 316249) If they have not left, you may use the accompan ying letter.
('59', 182, 6, 15, 316310) It is best now that the chapter should be closed as early as possible.
('59', 182, 6, 16, 316381) After it is closed, I will write in greater detail about the duties of people who live in the Ashram.
('59', 182, 6, 17, 316483) Titus’s overstaying his leave seems improper.
('59', 182, 6, 18, 316529) We would be in a better position to judge if we know the reason for his doing so.
('59', 182, 6, 19, 316611) But it can be stated as a general rule that nobody should overstay his leave except for reasons absolutely beyond his control.
('59', 182, 6, 20, 316738) However, do not start enforcing this rule with Titus.
('59', 182, 6, 21, 316792) Know the reason from him after he has returned and write to me.
('59', 182, 6, 22, 316856) But we can lay down the following rule for the future: Anybody who violates a vow or pledge taken by him should, if he is outside the Ashram at the time of doing so, keep out of the Ashram and, if he is in the Ashram, leave it.
('59', 182, 6, 23, 317084) In an ashram which is dedicated to truth, this rule should be observed without any exception.
('59', 182, 7, 24, 317178) 1 The date is supplied in Bapuna Patro 9: Shri Narandas Gandhine, Pt. II.
('59', 183, 0, 1, 317252) 184 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 183, 1, 2, 317294) It will not apply in a case in which the reason for violating the vow or the pledge is beyond the control of the person doing so.
('59', 183, 1, 3, 317424) A person who goes on leave also promises to return before a certain date.
('59', 183, 1, 4, 317498) This rule is observed even in ordinary institutions.
('59', 183, 1, 5, 317551) An institution in which it is not observed will not run for long or will lose its reputation.
('59', 183, 1, 6, 317645) You and other senior inmates there should discuss this rule among yourselves and, if all of you agree, read it out to the other inmates.
('59', 183, 1, 7, 317782) If all the people accept it, enforce it rigorously thereafter.
('59', 183, 1, 8, 317845) The enforcement of such rules is essential for the work which the Ashram has to do.
('59', 183, 1, 9, 317929) I feel that it will soon be necessary for us to lay down our lives for banishing untouchability.
('59', 183, 1, 10, 318026) But only those who are perfectly pure in their lives are fit to make such a sacrifice.
('59', 183, 1, 11, 318113) If we did not strictly observe the necessary rules in looking after all the girls in the Ashram, we would be lost.
('59', 183, 1, 12, 318228) We should not mind if the Ashram breaks up, but should not tolerate the violation of rules which we accept for ourselves.
('59', 183, 1, 13, 318350) We are judged by the manner in which we observe formal rules in their true spirit.
('59', 183, 1, 14, 318433) Only God can know whether we observe a rule in its spirit, but everybody can know whether or not it is formally observed.
('59', 183, 1, 15, 318555) However, the Ashram does not belong to me alone; it belongs to you all.
('59', 183, 1, 16, 318627) I have only stated my views.
('59', 183, 1, 17, 318656) It is for you all to consider whether you should act upon them.
('59', 183, 1, 18, 318720) Mahadev had got Vasram’s letter to him.
('59', 183, 1, 19, 318760) I have referred to this in my letter to him.
('59', 183, 1, 20, 318805) I hope he got that letter.
('59', 183, 1, 21, 318832) What you write about Chhotubhai is correct.
('59', 183, 1, 22, 318876) My headaches did not last long.
('59', 183, 1, 23, 318908) They were cured by mudpacks.
('59', 183, 1, 24, 318937) I have continued the packs as a preventive measure.

('59', 184, 2, 3, 319255) February 3, 1933
('59', 184, 3, 4, 319272) BHAGWANJI, I got a letter from you after many days.
('59', 184, 3, 5, 319324) Do we tolerate in other people what the Harijans do, i.e., refuse to work and yet ask for more money?
('59', 184, 3, 6, 319426) What error do you see in what Narandas says?
('59', 184, 3, 7, 319471) Shouldn’t we expect them to give eight hours’ work?
('59', 184, 3, 8, 319523) Misplaced pity is violence.
('59', 184, 3, 9, 319551) I make no distinction between them and other people, or only that we may tolerate faults in them which we would not in other people.

('59', 184, 8, 15, 319944) CHIMANLAL, I got your letter.
('59', 184, 8, 16, 319974) I need not write anything about the Giri family.
('59', 184, 8, 17, 320023) I have seen instances of asthma being cured by giving up salt and through such other experiments.
('59', 184, 8, 18, 320121) It is because of that that I recommen ded giving up salt in the book 1 on health.
('59', 184, 8, 19, 320203) In India I have not had the miraculous experiences I had in South Africa, and being very busy with other affairs I have not been able to make any experiments.
('59', 184, 8, 20, 320362) However, there will be no harm at all if you try the experiment.

('59', 184, 8, 24, 320612) The diet should consist only of fruit and milk.
('59', 184, 8, 25, 320660) As for fruits, the papaw and mosambis will suffice.
('59', 184, 8, 26, 320712) Such a diet requires no salt.
('59', 184, 8, 27, 320742) One should get clear stools; if there is any difficulty, one should take enema.
('59', 184, 8, 28, 320822) You should also daily practise slow breathing, retaining the air in the lungs for some time.
('59', 184, 8, 29, 320915) All this may help you.

('59', 187, 8, 16, 324625) I have no doubt that when the so called higher classes or castes have forgotten the distinctions between high and low and given up untouchability, Harijans will give up untoucha bility as among themselves.

('59', 188, 3, 9, 325468) By caste I have not meant varna.
('59', 188, 3, 10, 325501) I draw a broad distinction between varna and caste.
('59', 188, 3, 11, 325553) Caste is a comparatively modern growth.
('59', 188, 3, 12, 325593) It had some material use and it may even have it now, but I feel that it has outlived its use, and in any event it was and is a social institution, having no spiritual basis, which varna has.
('59', 188, 3, 13, 325785) But of this I would love to write when the occasion comes and time permits.

('59', 189, 9, 13, 326922) CHI NARAHARI, I got your letter.
('59', 189, 9, 14, 326955) It is a good sign that we are able to see our own weaknesses.
('59', 189, 9, 15, 327017) Even if people call us simpletons or impractical fools, we will not violate truth in word or deed.
('59', 189, 9, 16, 327116) Your experience that it is difficult to live in that manner in a place like that is that of others too, but one may be said to follow dharma only if one does so even in the face of difficulties.
('59', 189, 9, 17, 327311) He is not the best captain who steers a ship in a calm sea; it is the one who does not let a ship sink even in stormy waters.
('59', 189, 9, 18, 327437) But we should not feel unhappy about the past.
('59', 189, 9, 19, 327484) We have learnt the necessary lesson from it.
('59', 189, 9, 20, 327529) In future let God decide what work you should take up and what you should not.
('59', 189, 9, 21, 327608) All that we should do is to resolve to cling to truth in whatever circumstances we may be placed.
('59', 189, 9, 22, 327706) We should have faith that God does not test beyond their strength those who trust Him.
('59', 189, 9, 23, 327793) The pity is that we do not trust Him.
('59', 189, 9, 24, 327831) If we do, why should we feel concerned whether we shall lose our good name by clinging to truth, or harm the cause or displease a co worker?
('59', 189, 9, 25, 327972) God is there to concern Himself with all these problems.

('59', 190, 1, 2, 328137) bemoan the past.
('59', 190, 1, 3, 328154) Give me a description of Kuvalayananda’s Ashram.
('59', 190, 1, 4, 328203) Who are the teachers there?
('59', 190, 1, 5, 328231) What things do they teach?
('59', 190, 1, 6, 328258) What fee do they charge?
('59', 190, 1, 7, 328283) Manibehn and you should learn this lesson from what has happened, that a mother should know how to take care of the children’s teeth.
('59', 190, 1, 8, 328417) Their food should not be very soft and should not contain too much starch.
('59', 190, 1, 9, 328492) They should have sugar and jaggery in very small quantity only.
('59', 190, 1, 10, 328556) Instead, they may be allowed to suck juice from lots of sugarcane in the season.
('59', 190, 1, 11, 328637) When the season is over, the children may be given fruits containing sugar, like figs, munakka, dates, etc.
('59', 190, 1, 12, 328745) Moreover, the mother should stand by the side of the children when they brush their teeth in the morning and teach them to clean the teeth with the babool stick vigorously, and also see that they use a mixture of powdered coal and salt which has been properly sifted.
('59', 190, 1, 13, 329013) They should be taught to gargle properly after every meal and to massage the teeth and the gums with their fingers.
('59', 190, 1, 14, 329129) The truth is that most of us are scarcely fit to be parents.
('59', 190, 1, 15, 329190) Why should those who have not learnt the science of child care bring children into the world?
('59', 190, 1, 16, 329284) This question led some to the discovery of brahmacharya and some others to the discovery of artificial birth control.
('59', 190, 1, 17, 329402) The second is a dangerous and perilous way.
('59', 190, 1, 18, 329446) The middle course, that of lethargy and indifference, is still more dangerous and perilous.
('59', 190, 1, 19, 329538) While teaching Mani how to take care of the children’s teeth, teach her the whole science of child care.
('59', 190, 1, 20, 329643) She should also learn to observe the stools and the urine of the children.
('59', 190, 1, 21, 329718) She should examine them from time to time.
('59', 190, 1, 22, 329761) She should also examine their eyes, ears and nails, their habits of breathing and their tongues, and watch how they speak and what they do during the whole day.
('59', 190, 1, 23, 329922) All these things become very easy to do once the mother has formed the habit of doing them.
('59', 190, 1, 24, 330014) Tell Gomati that she may come whenever she wishes.

('59', 192, 3, 7, 331587) Mr. R. V. Shastri, B.A., B.L., is the Editor.
('59', 192, 3, 8, 331633) Only recently the latter left a lucrative post in partnership in Calcutta, and gave his services on a mere living wage to Mr. A. V. Thakkar, Secretary of the Servants of Untouchables Society.
('59', 192, 3, 9, 331825) When it was decided that this English edition is to be published in Poona, I asked Mr. Thakkar whether he could spare Mr. Shastri for the editorial work, and whether the latter would undertake the responsibility.
('59', 192, 3, 10, 332038) Both promptly responded.
('59', 192, 3, 11, 332063) I hope to contribute my full share so far as it is possible for me, to the contents of the paper.
('59', 192, 3, 12, 332161) I hope the paper will have a very large patronage.
('59', 192, 3, 13, 332212) It is desired to make the paper completely self supporting.
('59', 192, 3, 14, 332272) The annual subscription, inland, will be Rs. 4 including postage and Rs. 3 without, while the foreign subscription will be Rs. 5 8. A single copy will be priced one anna.
('59', 192, 3, 15, 332443) Intending subscribers will please send their names to Mr. Patwardhan, with subscription charges in money or stamps.

('59', 192, 6, 18, 332632) 2 After Gandhiji’s arrest in January 1932, Young India was discontinued, its last issue being that of January 14, 1932. As the movement against untouchability grew stronger, Gandhiji decided to bring out another journal, Harijan, to propagate his views.
('59', 192, 6, 19, 332886) The first issue of Harijan appeared from Poona on Fabruary 11 , 1933 under the editorship of R. V. Shastri.
('59', 192, 6, 20, 332994) On April 13, 1935, Mahadev Desai became its editor.
('59', 192, 6, 21, 333046) In 1940, during the Individual Civil Disobedience movement, it was suspended.
('59', 192, 6, 22, 333124) However from January 18, 1942 it again began to make its appearance from the Navajivan Press, Ahmedabad, till the press was raided on August 21, 1942 and the journal banned.
('59', 192, 6, 23, 333298) After the removal of the ban by the Government on January 10, 1946, the journal was revived on February 10, 1946, under the editorship of Pyarelal who continued to work in that capacity up to February 22, 1948. Subsequently, it was edited by Kishorelal G. Mashruwala and lastly by Maganbhai P. Desai till the journal stopped publication in March 1956.

('59', 193, 6, 7, 333911) February 5, 1933
('59', 193, 7, 8, 333928) DEAR COL.
('59', 193, 7, 9, 333938) DOYLE, Major Bhandari has just shown me the Bombay Government’s order in connection with my cable 1 to Mr. Andrews.
('59', 193, 7, 10, 334054) As it was rather important that it should go at once I have asked Major Bhandari kindly to withdraw an amount from my private account which as a matter of fact is not my own property.
('59', 193, 7, 11, 334238) I am hoping for a revision of the Government’s order and thus to reimburse my private account.
('59', 193, 7, 12, 334333) My reason for asking for a revision is this.
('59', 193, 7, 13, 334378) But for the very heavy bill that was paid to the dental surgeon my account would show a good balance.
('59', 193, 7, 14, 334480) You will recall that the dental surgeon was called in at your suggestion and not mine; also that when you suggested that I should obtain a new plate I asked for Dr. Desai, a dentist friend, to be called in, and that I also told you in my letter of the 28th June, 1932 that I had suggested his name as “I had no desire to land the Government in the expense of a new set of teeth”, and I knew that “Dr. Desai would not want to make any charge for the plates he might make for me.” You will thus see that I could have had the plate without any charge and at that time I had never suspected that the dental charges if they had to be paid would be paid out of monthly allowance.
('59', 193, 7, 15, 335154) As you are aware, from month to month I was saving as much out of the hundred rupees as possible.
('59', 193, 7, 16, 335252) But you chose to call in a dental surgeon of your own selection.
('59', 193, 7, 17, 335317) I could have no objection and when the bill was shown to me by Major Bhandari and when he told me that the money had to be paid out of my allowance, though I demurred I did not wish to raise any objection because I did not think then that I would want to draw upon the balance that was then outstanding in my

('59', 194, 1, 2, 335720) favour.
('59', 194, 1, 3, 335728) But in the new circumstances that have arisen, I must ask for the dental charges being removed from my account and if that be done there wouldbe at once a balance in my favour.
('59', 194, 1, 4, 335905) I would further suggest that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s and my accounts be amalgamated.
('59', 194, 1, 5, 335993) There is a balance in his favour still left.
('59', 194, 1, 6, 336038) If therefore these two accounts are amalgamated there would be a surplus left.
('59', 194, 1, 7, 336117) I have consulted the Sardar and he is quite willing that our accounts should be amalgamated.
('59', 194, 1, 8, 336210) In fact both of us have often suggested the adoption of this course to Major Bhandari.
('59', 194, 1, 9, 336297) May I ask you please to secure an early decision on this point as telegrams have to be frequently sent by me especially at this moment.

('59', 194, 6, 14, 336545) February 5, 1933
('59', 194, 7, 15, 336562) DEAR FATHER LASH, You do confound a poor man like me.
('59', 194, 7, 16, 336616) Who is father, and who is brother, and when, and also perhaps why?
('59', 194, 7, 17, 336683) But that is neither here nor there.
('59', 194, 7, 18, 336719) It is a fine thing to find you in Sabarmati.
('59', 194, 7, 19, 336764) I hope you will feel as much at home there as at the C.S.S.A., and it is good too that you are there when Mary Barr is there.
('59', 194, 7, 20, 336890) I take a promise from every stranger that visits the Sabarmati Ashram that he should give me his criticism of the Ashram and especially tell me frankly all about the defects he might have noticed in it.
('59', 194, 7, 21, 337093) You have to make the promise, please.
('59', 194, 7, 22, 337131) Now, for your difficulty.
('59', 194, 7, 23, 337157) It is not necessarily wrong “to be compelled to act against one’s reasoning and instinct through fear of hurting someone whom we love”, provided of course that the thing we do is in itself not only not wrong but morally worth doing.
('59', 194, 7, 24, 337390) You will notice that I have copied your own wording.
('59', 194, 7, 25, 337443) Conversely, to be compelled even through love to do a thing that is wrong is undoubte dly wrong.
('59', 194, 7, 26, 337540) But then that love itself is wrong.
('59', 194, 7, 27, 337576) It is good for me to love you and be loved by you.
('59', 194, 7, 28, 337627) But it is immoral for me to do wrong for the sake of love.
('59', 194, 7, 29, 337686) If there is any likelihood of that happening, we have
('59', 195, 0, 1, 337740) 196 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 195, 1, 2, 337782) to shun each other’s company.
('59', 195, 1, 3, 337812) Having stated these two propositions, let me cite the world’s experience in proof.
('59', 195, 1, 4, 337895) Whether it is right or wrong, it is a fact that in innumerable cases men and women are good, not for the sake of good, but for the sake of love which they owe to others or which they receive from them.
('59', 195, 1, 5, 338097) In an equal number of cases such love keeps us from falling.
('59', 195, 1, 6, 338158) Perhaps you will easily admit that Jesus Christ was and still remains one of the greatest among moral coercers of the world.
('59', 195, 1, 7, 338283) He continually coerces you, a very weak man otherwise, to do the right thing though your weak flesh would have you to do the wrong thing, and the strange thing is that you sing hymns of praise to Him for holding you tight in His chains.
('59', 195, 1, 8, 338520) You do not mind some people laughing at you for your helplessness and weakness.
('59', 195, 1, 9, 338600) Do not retort by way of answer: “But Jesus was Christ and God Incarnate.” I have given you the most telling illustration to show what is happening in everyday life.
('59', 195, 1, 10, 338765) Some have God to rely upon; others, poor mortals, have their parents; and yet others, like me, have their wives, sons and friends to lean on.
('59', 195, 1, 11, 338907) I had, not very many years ago, all but fallen, but the thought of Devdas, who was then living with me, of Mahadev, Mathuradas and others who were at that time surrounding me and whom I believed to be themselves leaning on me, and the thought of my wife, kept me from going to perdition.
('59', 195, 1, 12, 339195) It was their love which chained me so tightly and strongly that I could not burst through the bond although the flesh was pulling hard enough to tear the chains to bits and rush into hell fire.
('59', 195, 1, 13, 339389) That is the type of coercion and no other which my love, expr essed through my fast, was intended to exercise, the common thing in all these illustrations being the doing of a right act.
('59', 195, 1, 14, 339576) There is nothing wrong in people doing the right thing under the pressure of love and later doing the same thing for the sake of it.
('59', 195, 1, 15, 339709) I hope I have made my point clear, even though I might not have carried convition.
('59', 195, 1, 16, 339792) You must pardon me when I contradict you by saying that God’s shoulders are broad enough to bear the responsibility even of anything that is wrong.
('59', 195, 1, 17, 339940) In Christian parlance, does He not bear easily the humanly intolerable burden of the world’s sins?
('59', 195, 1, 18, 340039) This contra diction is unnecessary for our purpose, but I thought I would draw your attention to what I think is a clear slip.
('59', 195, 1, 19, 340166) My fast was certainly right so long as I hold the belief truthfully that it was prompted by God.
('59', 195, 1, 20, 340263) But even under God’s shelter I cannot claim immunity from a
('59', 196, 0, 1, 340323) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 197
('59', 196, 1, 2, 340368) fast which may be designed to compass unknowingly an immoral thing.
('59', 196, 1, 3, 340436) Therefore, the motive behind must be right, the end in front must be equally right, and the act itself propelled by the motive should also be right.
('59', 196, 1, 4, 340585) Hence in this chain the intermediate act, if it is violent, would vitiate both the motive and the end.
('59', 196, 1, 5, 340688) Hence the necessity for unadultered ahimsa—non violence in thought, word and deed.
('59', 196, 1, 6, 340771) And since the Gita says “Man can really only control his acts” 1, if they are right he may safely leave the rest to God, and whether he willingly and wittingly does so or not, God alone controls the rest.
('59', 196, 1, 7, 340976) I do hope that your foot is quite all right now.
('59', 196, 1, 8, 341025) If it is not, I would not now ask you to try the earth cure, but ask Narandas to send you to a doctor or fetch a doctor for you.
('59', 196, 1, 9, 341154) It is no use playing with even a small mischief.
('59', 196, 1, 10, 341203) With love from us,

('59', 197, 8, 16, 342838) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter and the memorandum of items of work to be undertaken by your Anti untouchability League.
('59', 197, 8, 17, 342959) I notice seven items, of which five relate to the carrying on of agitation or propaganda, one relates to satyagraha and one relates to the administration of funds.
('59', 197, 8, 18, 343123) My advice is that all these may be cut out altogether and the activities of the League be confined to actual constructive work by individual workers.
('59', 197, 8, 19, 343273) It is wholly unnecessary to agitate for waste land, political rights or even about matters of education.
('59', 197, 8, 20, 343378) What you need today is to educate as many as possible and to relieve economic distress of as many as possible and to have as many temples opened as possible.

('59', 198, 4, 10, 344027) I handed it to Sjt.
('59', 198, 4, 11, 344047) Patwardhan and asked him to tell me whether there was any overcharge at all in connection with the bill for the publication of the book.
('59', 198, 4, 12, 344184) He placed himself in touch with Vasukaka and he says that you never showed him the book but asked him for quotation for printing a book containing eight demi pages.
('59', 198, 4, 13, 344349) When he saw the proof and saw the corrections you have made, he said that in some respects the Arya Bhushan bill was lower than his.
('59', 198, 4, 14, 344482) Thus whereas for composing, the Arya Bhushan bill is Rs. 18, for the same amount of work, Chitrashala’s will be Rs. 36, for printing, Arya Bhushan 3, Chitrashala 5; for paper, Arya Bhushan 4, Chitrashala 8; and even in the bill as rendered by Chitrashala Press, the amount is 32 as against Arya Bhushan’s 25/8. For covers Arya Bhushan has charged 7, Chitrashala would charge 7/8, for binding Arya Bhushan has charged 7/8, Chitrashala would charge 10. So you will see that at every step you are wrong.

('59', 200, 1, 3, 346770) Nor, so far as I know, are temples already opened—and there are no fewer than 500 temples opened—deserted by the ordinary temple goers except a few.
('59', 200, 1, 4, 346919) I entirely agree with you that the hearts of people can only be changed by prayer, but my own experience and the experience of innumerable people shows that there is no intense prayer without fasting.
('59', 200, 1, 5, 347120) My fasts have been in the past, as I hope they will be in the future, if they have to come, an expression of intense prayer.
('59', 200, 2, 6, 347245) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('59', 200, 5, 11, 347393) February 5, 1933
('59', 200, 6, 12, 347410) KAKA, I got your letter.
('59', 200, 6, 13, 347435) You should have got your teeth extracted earlier.
('59', 200, 6, 14, 347485) Even now, you should get as many of them extracted as may be necessary, and not only thirteen.
('59', 200, 6, 15, 347580) As too many midwives complicate labour, so also with doctors.
('59', 200, 6, 16, 347642) Till you feel safe about the teeth, remain in Bombay.
('59', 200, 6, 17, 347696) Don’t feel at all that by doing so you will neglect your duty.
('59', 200, 6, 18, 347759) You can serve in many ways while staying in Bombay While the treatment of the teeth is going on, you should live in the open air and daily go for as long walks—up to fifteen miles—as your body can endure without fatigue.
('59', 200, 6, 19, 347980) I am sure you go to bed early and rise early.
('59', 200, 6, 20, 348026) The morning hours should always be spent in taking walks.
('59', 200, 6, 21, 348084) In food, it is necessary to exclude all starches for the present.
('59', 200, 6, 22, 348150) The best diet of course would be milk, curds, ghee and the juice of oranges and mosambis.
('59', 200, 6, 23, 348240) These things do not have to be chewed.
('59', 200, 6, 24, 348279) The starch should be converted into sugar in the mouth, which will not be possible in the present condition of your teeth.
('59', 200, 6, 25, 348402) Hence the diet which I have suggested is the only suitable one.
('59', 200, 6, 26, 348466) You may, if you wish, eat some green vegetables, like gourd or bhaji, but even these are not necessary.
('59', 200, 6, 27, 348570) Have no fear about my teeth.
('59', 200, 6, 28, 348599) Since the doctors here don’t worry about my elbow, why should I?
('59', 200, 6, 29, 348664) For calling my own doctor, I would have to obtain special permission, which the Government is not

('59', 201, 1, 2, 348804) likely to give.
('59', 201, 1, 3, 348820) You should rest assured that I am not at all neglecting my health.
('59', 201, 1, 4, 348887) The moment I suspect something, I will not remain indifferent even for a moment.
('59', 201, 1, 5, 348968) And why should you worry about that which I myself am ready to worry about?
('59', 201, 1, 6, 349044) Your suggestion about Bal is correct.
('59', 201, 1, 7, 349082) Write to me and let me know when he comes to Bombay.
('59', 201, 1, 8, 349135) I believe Harijan will be published on Saturday.

('59', 201, 5, 11, 349277) February 5, 1933
('59', 201, 6, 12, 349294) BHAI BALWANTSINH, I have your letter.
('59', 201, 6, 13, 349332) The guru must possess the virtues of a sthitaprajna 2. I have not come across such an embodiment of perfection.
('59', 201, 6, 14, 349444) But I have found a few people in all countries who possess varying degrees of these virtues.
('59', 201, 6, 15, 349537) 2. To remain equally unmoved by happiness and unhappiness, honour and dishonour means that one should not be hurt by insults nor feel elated by honours.
('59', 201, 6, 16, 349690) But in no way does it follow that one should not reply to the insult or end the sorrow.
('59', 201, 6, 17, 349778) 3. The virtues of a devotee can be acquired by effort and the direction of effort has been indicated in the chapter 3 on bhakti.
('59', 201, 6, 18, 349907) But there is nothing to hinder one from acquiring the virtues in a different way if it be possible.
('59', 201, 6, 19, 350007) 4. Sleep can become sounder by practice.
('59', 201, 6, 20, 350048) On waking from sound sleep there is awareness of nothing except sleep and a sense of well being.
('59', 201, 6, 21, 350145) Even when the Gita, etc., are recited many thoughts rise unawares in the mind.
('59', 201, 6, 22, 350224) Sound sleep is possible when the soul is in rapport with the Gita or, in other words, with God.
('59', 201, 6, 23, 350320) Therefore we should faithfully continue the present effort of filling ourselves with the Gita.
('59', 201, 7, 24, 350415) 1 The letter carries the following note in English evidently for the jail authorities: ‘‘This contains only answers to religious questions.

('59', 202, 1, 2, 350657) 5. The idea of writing about the Ramayana too has always been there but lack of time has stood in the way.
('59', 202, 1, 3, 350764) Anyway there is no longer much need of it.
('59', 202, 1, 4, 350807) One who studies Anasaktiyoga 1 well can easily get at the secret of the Ramayana.
('59', 202, 1, 5, 350889) 6. The history contained in the Ramayana is only secondary.
('59', 202, 1, 6, 350949) Spiritual philosophy is the main thing.
('59', 202, 1, 7, 350989) Dharma has been revealed through the unfolding of events.
('59', 202, 1, 8, 351047) Hence while studying the Ramayana, you must regard Rama as the Supreme Being and Ravana as the forces opposed to Him.
('59', 202, 1, 9, 351165) You may equate Rama with Krishna, his forces with the Pandava army, and Ravana with Duryodhana.
('59', 202, 1, 10, 351261) The Mahabharata and Ramayana express one and the same idea.
('59', 202, 1, 11, 351321) Your study of the Gurumukhi works is also useful.
('59', 202, 1, 12, 351371) The vow of memorizing the Gita must be kept.
('59', 202, 1, 13, 351416) I have answered Bhai Fulchand’s letter.
('59', 202, 1, 14, 351456) I hope this letter reaches [him].

('59', 202, 7, 19, 351601) [Before February 6, 1933] 3
('59', 202, 8, 20, 351629) You should not be impatient.
('59', 202, 8, 21, 351658) There should be no satyagraha just yet.
('59', 202, 8, 22, 351698) We must educate public opinion, and deal gently with orthodoxy.
('59', 202, 8, 23, 351762) Remember that at one time many of us shared the same prejudices as orthodox people do today.
('59', 202, 8, 24, 351855) You must, first of all, ascertain whether it is the trustees who refuse to open the temples or whether it is the temple goers who would not tolerate the admission of Harijans.
('59', 202, 8, 25, 352031) For that purpose, you should have a scientific and accurate referendum, voting being strictly confined to those who are entitled to enter the respective temples.
('59', 202, 8, 26, 352193) The proprietors of hotels and saloons stand on a somewhat different footing.
('59', 202, 8, 27, 352270) They have their bread and butter to consider, and they must not be expected to take risks.

('59', 203, 4, 5, 352885) February 6, 1933
('59', 203, 5, 6, 352902) THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BOMBAY HOME DEPARTMENT
('59', 203, 6, 7, 352960) DEAR SIR, I enclose herewith letter from Shrimati Mirabai (Slade) dated 28th ultimo and handed to me only this day.
('59', 203, 6, 8, 353076) It speaks for itself.
('59', 203, 6, 9, 353098) Being in answer to an anxious enquiry from me, the letter might have been given to me earlier.
('59', 203, 6, 10, 353193) Since this letter was written the usual weekly letter was received in which she stated that she was examined by the Civil Surgeon who had recommended her for transfer.
('59', 203, 6, 11, 353361) Miss Slade had repeatedly complained to me in her weekly letters about the stenches and the stifling atmosphere of Arthur Road Prison and recurring attacks of headache, giddiness, eruptions and the like.
('59', 203, 6, 12, 353565) But I felt, as she had felt, that as a prisoner she must suffer the hardships of prison life.
('59', 203, 6, 13, 353659) It might however be held pardonable, if not even right, in cases causing anxiety about health, for prisoners to bring to the knowledge of superior authority the condition of their health.
('59', 203, 6, 14, 353847) Acting in accordance with that rule I have approached Government before now, wherever I have felt the necessity of bringing to their notice cases of prisoners in whose welfare I have been interested as if they were my own nearest relatives.
('59', 203, 6, 15, 354088) The letter enclosed gives a true picture of Miss Slade’s health, and her attachment towards me.
('59', 203, 6, 16, 354184) It has been a privilege to me to enjoy that affection.
('59', 203, 6, 17, 354239) She came to me with the fullest consent of her late mother and the reluctant consent of her father the late Sir Edmond Slade who never cut off the annuity that he used to give to her.
('59', 203, 6, 18, 354423) I hardly need to say anything more about her family connections which are better known to Government than to me.
('59', 203, 6, 19, 354536) You will notice the dread she has of being sent away to a place further away from me.
('59', 203, 6, 20, 354622) I wish she was less sensitive, but her sensitiveness has to be taken into account as it so quickly affects her body.
('59', 203, 6, 21, 354739) I therefore suggest her transfer to the Female Yard attached to
('59', 204, 0, 1, 354803) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 205
('59', 204, 1, 2, 354848) this Prison.
('59', 204, 1, 3, 354861) From all the accounts that I have heard of the Yard, it is airy, roomy and much cooler than Arthur Road Prison.
('59', 204, 1, 4, 354973) She will certainly be happier there.
('59', 204, 1, 5, 355010) I suggest too that she be examined by specialists in view of what she says about her glands and the condition of her tonsils.
('59', 204, 1, 6, 355136) I would gladly name my doctors if Government would entertain their names, but I have no desire to press the point.
('59', 204, 1, 7, 355251) I should be entirely satisfied so long as she is examined by specialists.
('59', 204, 1, 8, 355325) It grieves me to have to approach the Government over a delicate and personal matter.
('59', 204, 1, 9, 355411) But I entertain the hope that perhaps the Government may even appreciate the fact that I have brought this matter to their notice.
('59', 204, 1, 10, 355542) I shall be thankful for an early decision.
('59', 204, 2, 11, 355585) I remain,

('59', 204, 8, 19, 355940) Whether there is or not, my own course in the matter is simple, as I have said repeatedly that caste Hindus have wronged the so called untouchables, and that those of us who have realized the magnitude of that wrong have got to do penance for it.

('59', 205, 3, 4, 356535) MY DEAR THAKKAR BAPA, I have your several letters.
('59', 205, 3, 5, 356586) As to the second edition of Holloway’s, we must give up the idea for the time being.
('59', 205, 3, 6, 356671) As to the second Harijan day, can you tell me how much was collected on the previous Harijan day?
('59', 205, 3, 7, 356769) It is most vexing that the Hindi Harijan is taking all this time.
('59', 205, 3, 8, 356835) I wonder if I sent you or Ghanshyamdas an offer from Delhi from a man to take over his weekly which he is now publishing—lat; It might be worth while seeing him.
('59', 205, 3, 9, 356997) According to his statement, Indra knows him.
('59', 205, 3, 10, 357042) The English edition would be out on Saturday.
('59', 205, 3, 11, 357088) We are bringing out 10,000 copies of the first issue.
('59', 205, 3, 12, 357142) It will be stopped if it does not become self supporting, and it cannot but be self supporting if all the Provincial Boards subscribe to a certain number of copies.
('59', 205, 3, 13, 357307) They must need them for their workers if they are efficiently working organiza tions.
('59', 205, 3, 14, 357393) Every such organization has to have a common organ.
('59', 205, 3, 15, 357445) This applies to you also.
('59', 205, 3, 16, 357471) So you will please telegraph to me how many copies you will want and you have to pay in advance for the copies you may need.
('59', 205, 3, 17, 357596) You may send for the minimum number, so that at your end too there may be no waste.
('59', 205, 3, 18, 357680) Some copies no doubt you will have to distribute free.
('59', 205, 3, 19, 357735) I would like you also to send Patwardhan a cheque or draft for Rs. 500. I had Rs. 544 6 0 with me which I wanted to transfer to you, but now I am paying that amount to Patwardhan.
('59', 205, 3, 20, 357915) It would be regarded as a loan as from you to the paper, and as soon as subscriptions arrive, the loan will be refunded, unless there is a loss from the very commencement.
('59', 205, 3, 21, 358087) Thus, you will credit me with Rs. [5]44 6 0 1 as having been received from me for untouchability work and debit Harijan with Rs. 544 6 0 in addition to the Rs. 500 I have asked you to send from there.
('59', 205, 3, 22, 358288) Patwardhan cannot possibly need more than Rs. 1000 to go on with.
('59', 205, 3, 23, 358354) Before he begins to receive subscriptions, moneys have to be disbursed for stamps, wages and paper.
('59', 205, 3, 24, 358454) If there is any news to impart for publication in Harijan you

('59', 206, 11, 15, 359205) February 7, 1933
('59', 206, 12, 16, 359222) DEAR BABOO BHAGWANDAS, A professor of Arabic has written to me asking for assistance in the work that he has undertaken of translating Manusmriti into Arabic.
('59', 206, 12, 17, 359381) He does not know Sanskrit himself.
('59', 206, 12, 18, 359416) Therefore he has to rely upon English translations.
('59', 206, 12, 19, 359468) I have, however, warned him against taking the printed text going under the name of Manusmriti as the reality.
('59', 206, 12, 20, 359579) When I read this book, whilst I was stirred by many verses of moral beauty, I was repelled by several verses which seemed to be so wholly contrary to the spirit of the moral teaching.
('59', 206, 12, 21, 359763) I have therefore always held that the printed text is not the work of the same author nor written at the same time and that there have been many interpolations after the
('59', 206, 13, 22, 359933) 1 The addressee had requested Gandhiji to send his blessings for the success of a Harijan candidate in a bye election for the membership of the Bihar and Orissa Legislative Council.

('59', 207, 1, 2, 360157) original verses were written.
('59', 207, 1, 3, 360187) I have no authority for this statement save my own instinct.
('59', 207, 1, 4, 360248) You have however made a deep study of this book and perhaps a comparative study of all the Smritis.
('59', 207, 1, 5, 360348) If you have come to any decision and written something on it, I would like to have your opinion, or, if you know any person who has held the view that I hold of the Smriti or how he has reconciled the contradictory verses, I would like you to enlighten me.
('59', 207, 1, 6, 360605) I am just now hard pressed owing to Harijan work falling on my shoulders.
('59', 207, 1, 7, 360679) I wanted to write separately to Principal Dhruva on this matter, but I must give up that ambition and ask you to kindly pass this letter on to him so that he can let me have his own views also.
('59', 207, 1, 8, 360873) I have warned Professor Haqqi against translating the printed text without examining the question from the standpoint suggested by me.
('59', 207, 1, 9, 361008) But I cannot help him if he wants to be guided along the lines suggested by me unless I have some authoritative guidance myself.
('59', 207, 1, 10, 361137) My instinct is good enough for my consolation but it can be no guide for others if I cannot support it with external convincing evidence.
('59', 207, 2, 11, 361275) Yours sincerely

('59', 207, 6, 15, 361369) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter.
('59', 207, 6, 16, 361411) 1 I understand what you say.
('59', 207, 6, 17, 361440) If Harijans were not Hindus, samskara 2 would be necessary.
('59', 207, 6, 18, 361500) None is necessary for Hindus before they can enter temples.
('59', 207, 6, 19, 361560) Of course they have to observe the laws of ceremonial cleanliness and the rest.
('59', 207, 7, 20, 361640) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('59', 208, 2, 3, 361989) February 7, 1933
('59', 208, 3, 4, 362006) MY DEAR HARIBHAU PHATAK, I have your letter.
('59', 208, 3, 5, 362051) I am sorry that Mr. Mate should think that I betrayed any impatience or anger in carrying on the argument with him the other day.
('59', 208, 3, 6, 362181) If there was any such betrayed, I must apologize to him.
('59', 208, 3, 7, 362238) It was certainly not intended.
('59', 208, 3, 8, 362269) He can come and discuss the whole thing with me.
('59', 208, 3, 9, 362318) I promise to observe complete silence and listen to him whilst he is speaking.
('59', 208, 3, 10, 362397) After all, my business is to deliver my message and convert those who think differently from me.
('59', 208, 3, 11, 362494) I have no desire whatsoever to impose my views on anybody, and I cannot convert anybody by being impatient or angry.
('59', 208, 3, 12, 362611) He may bring any friend he likes.
('59', 208, 3, 13, 362645) Let there be a previous appointment made so as to avoid disappointment.
('59', 208, 3, 14, 362717) Now that I have to attend to Harijan I must not give any appointments for Wednesdays and Thursdays.
('59', 208, 3, 15, 362817) Fridays and Saturdays would be quite good.
('59', 208, 3, 16, 362860) As to the subject matter of your letter Mr. Mate is quite wrong in thinking that any but Hindu voters will have the right of voting under the Temple entry Bill, and I can show quite clearly that there is absolutely no question whatsoever of compulsion.
('59', 208, 3, 17, 363113) Nor is there the slightest desire to see the Bill passed if the Hindu Members do not want it.
('59', 208, 3, 18, 363207) The first Bill has no reference even to temples.
('59', 208, 3, 19, 363256) It is the most innocent that can possibly be conceived.
('59', 208, 3, 20, 363312) It simply takes untouchability out of the penal law of the land.
('59', 208, 3, 21, 363377) Surely, it was wrong when the courts were first called upon to give a legal status to untouchability.
('59', 208, 3, 22, 363479) I should very much like to know in what respect either Bill constitutes an interference with anybody’s liberty.
('59', 208, 3, 23, 363591) I am sorry to hear about Yashoda Bai.
('59', 208, 3, 24, 363629) I shall certainly write to her.
('59', 208, 3, 25, 363661) With reference to the charkhas as you know, Kanitkar was manufacturing the very thing in Poona.
('59', 208, 3, 26, 363757) His boy knows the thing.
('59', 208, 3, 27, 363782) I had suggested slight improvements in the pattern that was brought to me.
('59', 208, 3, 28, 363857) To have them from Bardoli would mean probably four annas railage, if not more, for each charkha, when the whole thing is capable of being made locally and cheaply.
('59', 208, 3, 29, 364021) But if they must be had from Bardoli, I can easily get them.
('59', 208, 3, 30, 364082) Please thank the makers of the oils of the two bottles.
('59', 208, 3, 31, 364138) I have still

('59', 209, 5, 6, 364455) February 7, 1933
('59', 209, 6, 7, 364472) MY DEAR C. R., I am sure you are doing good work there.
('59', 209, 6, 8, 364528) I do not at all like Ranga Iyer’s statements in reply to Jagadguru’s telegram.
('59', 209, 6, 9, 364607) He there says, in spite of the Guruvayur referendum result, that Malabar Hindus are against temple entry and gives a certificate to sanatanists for earnestness of purpose, conservatism and what not, and makes me out to be a fair approach to Buddha.
('59', 209, 6, 10, 364856) If all the three statements were correct, one could have nothing to say against them, however embarrassing they may be.
('59', 209, 6, 11, 364976) But they are all the three wrong.
('59', 209, 6, 12, 365010) Apart from the Guruvayur referendum, nobody knows the opinion of Malabar Hindus.
('59', 209, 6, 13, 365091) Your own evidence of Travancore is against Ranga Iyer’s opinion.
('59', 209, 6, 14, 365156) The sanatanists cannot deserve a good certificate if they can produce no one who will at all listen to reason and understand the viewpoint of the reformer.
('59', 209, 6, 15, 365312) They exaggerate the reformers’ claim out of all proportion, and then to describe me as Buddha is to damn the cause in advance, for orthodoxy believes Buddha to have been an atheist denying the authority of the Vedas, varnashrama and everything.
('59', 209, 6, 16, 365557) They take pride in the fact that Shankar arose to drive out Buddhism and they will naturally want to drive me out if I am anything like the Buddha of their imagination.
('59', 209, 6, 17, 365726) The latest statement of Ranga Iyer therefore increases my fear of advocacy.
('59', 209, 6, 18, 365802) I hope Devdas had my letter awaiting him when he reached Delhi.
('59', 209, 6, 19, 365866) That letter anticipated his letter just received.
('59', 209, 6, 20, 365916) I am too full of Harijan work just now to give you more or write to him separately.
('59', 209, 7, 21, 366000) Yours sincerely,

('59', 210, 2, 3, 366156) February 7, 1933
('59', 210, 3, 4, 366173) Requested to explain further his statement of 14th January 1 in view of
('59', 210, 4, 5, 366245) interpretations in the Assembly yesterday, Gandhji declared to the Associated Press: The written words stand.
('59', 210, 4, 6, 366355) I must not add to what 1 have already said in my statement.
('59', 210, 5, 7, 366415) Gandhiji’s attention was drawn to different interpretations put on this
('59', 210, 6, 8, 366487) statement, and particularly to the reference made by Sir Harry Haig in this connection
('59', 210, 7, 9, 366574) to the meaning attributed to his statement by the Bombay Congress Bulletin.
('59', 210, 8, 10, 366650) Gandhiji replied: I cannot help people putting all sorts of interpretation to my writings.
('59', 210, 8, 11, 366741) It is not a new experience to me.
('59', 210, 8, 12, 366775) My statement is quite explicit.
('59', 210, 8, 13, 366807) You can surely find the correct meaning.
('59', 210, 8, 14, 366848) I have certainly not intended the statement to be equivocal, but it should be read as one whole.
('59', 210, 8, 15, 366945) You can read many meanings out of sentences detached from their context.
('59', 210, 9, 16, 367018) Always alive to the limitations to his freedom of speech, Gandhiji declined to
('59', 210, 10, 17, 367097) answer more pointed questions in this connection, saying: You are treading on slippery ground.
('59', 210, 11, 18, 367192) Replying to another question regarding the charge of inconsistency levelled
('59', 210, 12, 19, 367268) against him, in so far as he, a non co operator, had sought the aid of the Government
('59', 210, 13, 20, 367354) and the legislature in connection with temple entry, Gandhiji said he could not
('59', 210, 14, 21, 367434) answer the question without entering into the region of politics, which he could not
('59', 210, 15, 22, 367519) He proceeded: I must therefore take the risk of damage to my reputation.
('59', 210, 15, 23, 367592) But I prize my honour above reputation, and if that remains safe, then reputation will take care of itself.

('59', 211, 2, 3, 367861) February 7, 1933
('59', 211, 3, 4, 367878) Commenting on the letter of Jagadguru Shankaracharya of Puri to Mr. Ranga Iyer and the latter’s reply thereto, Gandhiji said in an interview to the Associated Press: I am really sorry that the Jagadguru should have written that letter about the Bills.
('59', 211, 3, 5, 368130) I venture to think that the Bills do not, in any shape or form, interfere with religious liberty.
('59', 211, 3, 6, 368228) On the contrary, both the Bills jealously guard it.
('59', 211, 3, 7, 368280) Nor is the analogy used by the Jagadguru correct.
('59', 211, 3, 8, 368330) There is no technical question involved in the Bills requiring technical knowledge.
('59', 211, 3, 9, 368414) It is always open to worshippers to determine what company they would take with them for prayer.
('59', 211, 3, 10, 368511) You may call that even a change of religion if you like.
('59', 211, 3, 11, 368568) But you cannot deprive the people of that right.
('59', 211, 3, 12, 368617) What is there to prevent cent per cent of the worshippers in a temple admitting whomsoever they choose, even though such admission may be against the Agama governing that particular temple?
('59', 211, 3, 13, 368807) There is no religious interference involved in restoring to the people a right that should never have been taken away from them.
('59', 211, 3, 14, 368936) And if it is admitted that cent per cent of the worshippers can, if they choose, alter the rules of admission into a temple, then it should easily be conceded that a sufficient majority should have the right of determining the question of admission so long as they do not interfere with the liberty of the minority to perform worship in isolation from the majority.
('59', 211, 3, 15, 369302) Surely, it is a serious thing for a responsible person like the Jagadguru to label reformers, who claim to be followers of the same faith and believe in the same Shastras, as renegades from sanatana dharma.
('59', 211, 3, 16, 369509) It also passes my comprehension how the passage of the Bills can be considered an unconstitutional procedure.
('59', 211, 3, 17, 369619) If the Jagadguru’s letter is thus open to objection, I am afraid Mr. Ranga Iyer’s reply also needs some corrections.
('59', 211, 3, 18, 369736) I am not so sure as he is, that Malabar Hindu opinion is against the Bill, and so against the temple entry of Harijans.
('59', 211, 3, 19, 369856) The results of the Guruvayur referendum may be regarded as an indication to the contrary.
('59', 211, 3, 20, 369946) Eyewitnesses who have been in Malabar have also told me that popular opinion is by no means against temple entry.
('59', 211, 3, 21, 370060) But that is a
('59', 212, 0, 1, 370074) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 213
('59', 212, 1, 2, 370119) matter which can be determined anywhere if both the parties agree to have an unofficial referendum under joint supervision.
('59', 212, 1, 3, 370243) Then, Mr. Ranga Iyer, in his enthusiasm and blind affection for me, has been betrayed into an unfortunate analogy.
('59', 212, 1, 4, 370358) I do not consider myself in any way fit to be compared with the Buddha.
('59', 212, 1, 5, 370430) I regard myself as a very common man—a poor worker, liable to all the errors mankind is prone to make.
('59', 212, 1, 6, 370533) I am merely a humble truth seeker.
('59', 212, 1, 7, 370568) But the analogy is unfortunate for another reason also.
('59', 212, 1, 8, 370624) Sanatanists would say that the Buddha was an atheist, and that he did not accept the authority of the Vedas and did not believe in their divinity—not that as a matter of fact he was an atheist or did not believe in the Vedas.
('59', 212, 1, 9, 370850) But, what he really was, is not pertinent to our point.
('59', 212, 1, 10, 370906) Therefore, if I am also considered an atheist or non believer in the divinity of the Vedas, I am certainly out of court, as a reformer asking Hindus to reject modern untouchability as being wholly against Hindu Shastras regarded as a whole.

('59', 213, 3, 5, 371744) V. Joshi of Sangli was here the other day to discuss matters about untouchability, and he reminded me that when I was in Sangli a part of the collections made there amounting to over Rs. 850/ was left with you.
('59', 213, 3, 6, 371955) He told me too that the amount had accumulated with you together with interest and that you would not part with the amount except under my authority.

('59', 213, 3, 8, 372165) Gangadharrao Deshpande was entrusted with the collections, I referred the matter to him, and he tells me that he has recollection of this particular collection.
('59', 213, 3, 9, 372326) Will you kindly now send the amount with interest to me, or, if it suits you better, hand it over on my behalf to Mr. Abhyankar to whom I am writing by the same post that will take this letter?

('59', 213, 8, 16, 372724) If I was to stop your fast I had to use strong and precise language.
('59', 213, 8, 17, 372793) As you had taken the fast in connection with something I had done or not done, I had to assume authority and also presume that I knew you sufficiently to send you a peremptory telegram.
('59', 213, 8, 18, 372979) Now that you claim to have known me through my writings and doings, evidently the authoritative tone I adopted in my wire was quite justified.
('59', 213, 8, 19, 373122) You must remember that I was acting like a responsible physician to his patient and I am glad that you promptly responded by breaking your fast.

('59', 214, 11, 17, 374141) Whereupon I sent a letter to the Government requesting your transfer to Yeravda and also an examination by specialists.

('59', 215, 1, 6, 375482) There should be therefore on the one hand every honest and permissible attempt to keep the body in good condition and to obtain the other amenities, on the other to receive disappointment with perfect detachment.
('59', 215, 1, 7, 375695) You should continue to report the whole of your condition to the Civil Surgeon and give him the history of your previous glands.
('59', 215, 1, 8, 375824) I wish you had written about them before to me.
('59', 215, 1, 9, 375872) Anyway now the matter is in the Government’s hands and more in God’s hands.
('59', 215, 1, 10, 375948) ‘Not a blade moves but by His will.’
('59', 215, 2, 11, 375985) The passage you quote from the Gita refers to moderate habits.
('59', 215, 2, 12, 376048) That is not what I had in mind.
('59', 215, 2, 13, 376080) The passage I had in mind occurs in the last chapter, 52nd verse.
('59', 215, 2, 14, 376146) I should translate it thus.
('59', 215, 2, 15, 376174) “Who prefers solitude, who eats meagre food, who has under perfect control thought, speech and action, who is intent on meditation, who is free always from attachments.”
('59', 215, 3, 16, 376344) You have no reason to complain of the quantity of your food.
('59', 215, 3, 17, 376405) You dare not go by the abstract measurement.
('59', 215, 3, 18, 376450) Double your quantity would be really meagre for many of our friends.
('59', 215, 3, 19, 376519) The condition of your own body should be the sole guide as to the quantity without reference to that taken by others.
('59', 215, 3, 20, 376637) All we should recognize is that voluntary meagre eating is one of the most difficult things in the world.
('59', 215, 3, 21, 376743) It is a perpetual fast much more difficult than the complete periodic fasts.
('59', 215, 3, 22, 376820) Meagre food voluntarily taken must lead to perfect poise, i.e., perfect health of body and mind.
('59', 215, 3, 23, 376917) We can but make the attempt.
('59', 215, 4, 24, 376946) My food and weight remain what I described them to be last week.
('59', 215, 4, 25, 377011) The elbow continues as before.
('59', 215, 4, 26, 377042) I do not think any more about it.
('59', 215, 4, 27, 377076) I thought I told you that I had resumed spinning.
('59', 215, 4, 28, 377126) I did it, I think, Tuesday last week.
('59', 215, 4, 29, 377164) I do it whilst I am receiving visitors.
('59', 215, 4, 30, 377204) I have fixed no minimum.
('59', 215, 4, 31, 377229) I have not yet reached even 160 rounds.
('59', 215, 4, 32, 377269) Yesterday’s was the highest, 141. The count is over 40. What you say about Devdas is true.

('59', 216, 1, 6, 377626) He could not have found a better.
('59', 216, 1, 7, 377660) I am, we all are, just now very busy over the forthcoming Harijan.
('59', 216, 1, 8, 377727) I have a very good editor and an equally good manager.
('59', 216, 1, 9, 377782) The press belongs to the Servants of India Society with which I enjoy what may be called spiritual relations.
('59', 216, 1, 10, 377892) I have therefore not to worry about the details of management.
('59', 216, 1, 11, 377955) God is great and compassionate if He is also terrible.

('59', 216, 6, 18, 378161) DEAR FRIEND, With reference to our conversation of the 7th instant, I do hope that the members of the Satya Shodhak Samaj 2 will throw themselves heart and soul into the campaign against untouchability subject to the limitations prescribed by the Servants of Untouchables Society.
('59', 216, 6, 19, 378442) I know that the Satya Shodhak Samaj is against Brahminism and against varnashrama.
('59', 216, 6, 20, 378525) The present campaign does not deal with varnashrama at all and is not a campaign against Brahminism, but against untouchabi lity, pure and simple, because the Society does not believe that untouchability is any part of Brahminism.
('59', 216, 6, 21, 378756) We must not here mix up Brahmins who swear by untouchability with Brahminism.
('59', 216, 6, 22, 378834) For we have a large and growing body of Brahmins who are as much opposed to untouchability as you and I can be.

('59', 217, 3, 4, 379219) DEAR COL.
('59', 217, 3, 5, 379229) DOYLE, Major Bhandari communicated to me yesterday the contents of the Government orders about a certain letter from Appasaheb Patwardhan addressed to me and withheld by Government.
('59', 217, 3, 6, 379411) Not knowing the contents of the letter I can say nothing about it.
('59', 217, 3, 7, 379478) I see in this morning’s Times of India that Appasaheb Patwardhan has put himself on reduced rations.
('59', 217, 3, 8, 379579) This has naturally disturbed me.
('59', 217, 3, 9, 379612) I shall thank you to tell me whether there is any truth in the report.
('59', 217, 3, 10, 379683) Will you also please let me know what the orders of the Government of India are in the matter of conservancy work by volunteer prisoners?

('59', 217, 6, 15, 379960) BHAISHRI RAMJI, Swarupbehn, wife of Ranjit Pandit and daughter of late Motilalji, is at present in Bombay.
('59', 217, 6, 16, 380067) I think it would be nice if a tour of Kathiawar was arranged for her in connection with untouchability.
('59', 217, 6, 17, 380171) You should collect money for that purpose and perhaps it may influence people.
('59', 217, 6, 18, 380250) At present she is going to do this work alone.
('59', 217, 6, 19, 380297) She has been detained so that she can be of service to Kathiawar.
('59', 217, 6, 20, 380363) She is married to a Kathiawari, so we have a claim over her.
('59', 217, 6, 21, 380424) If you wish to invite her, send me a wire and the programme.
('59', 217, 6, 22, 380485) Who will tour with her?
('59', 217, 6, 23, 380509) One woman should also travel with her.
('59', 217, 6, 24, 380548) It would be better if Saraladevi or some other woman from there itself went with her.
('59', 217, 6, 25, 380634) She could well be taken to several places in Gujarat.
('59', 217, 6, 26, 380688) I shall write about this to Ahmedabad.

('59', 218, 2, 3, 380871) February 9, 1933
('59', 218, 3, 4, 380888) Mahatma Gandhi has put himself in communication 1 with the Government in connection with the reported fast of Appasaheb Patwardhan, a political prisoner in the Ratnagiri jail, and he will decide his course of action in this matter on receipt of the Government reply.
('59', 218, 3, 5, 381155) I have no knowledge of the fast or rather his putting himself on reduced rations, apart from the newspaper report just shown to me.
('59', 218, 3, 6, 381287) Of course, the news is disturbing; it has vital connection with my previous action 2 regarding Appasaheb and untouchability in Indian prisons.
('59', 218, 3, 7, 381430) I have sought authoritative information from the Government, and meanwhile, I hope the Press report is incorrect.
('59', 218, 4, 8, 381544) Asked if this fast will have his support, Gandhiji said he would prefer not to say anything at present, not having all the facts in his possession.

('59', 219, 8, 13, 383177) With reference.
('59', 219, 8, 14, 383193) to Jitendralal Bannerji and B. C. Chatterji, I think you should take no public notice of their letters, but you should carry on quiet correspondence with Ramanand Baboo.
('59', 219, 8, 15, 383363) I am carrying on correspondence both with them and Dr. Bidhan.
('59', 219, 8, 16, 383426) No public controversy is needed at least at this stage.
('59', 219, 8, 17, 383482) With reference to your letter about Harijan, after the letter was sent Ghanshyamdas came here and he gave the verbal sanction.
('59', 219, 8, 18, 383609) Nothing more was therefore necessary.
('59', 219, 8, 19, 383647) Nevertheless, the written sanction should be recorded in your books.
('59', 219, 8, 20, 383716) With this you will have the Harijan itself.
('59', 219, 8, 21, 383760) I am hoping that it will be entirely self supporting.
('59', 219, 8, 22, 383814) I have also the Memorandum about the proposed change of the name of the Society.
('59', 219, 8, 23, 383895) I note the decision recorded by you and Hariji.

('59', 221, 3, 5, 385289) But birth and death are always with us and if there is joy about birth we must cancel it through the knowledge of coming death, and if there is sorrow about death we must cancel it by the knowledge of coming birth.

('59', 221, 8, 19, 386226) I have already written to you about the expenses.
('59', 221, 8, 20, 386276) Ghanshya mdas has promised to send you a contribution and he told me that he would write to you too.
('59', 221, 8, 21, 386377) I hope you will remind him if you have not done so already.

('59', 222, 3, 4, 386838) DEAR SISTER, I thank you for your letter.
('59', 222, 3, 5, 386880) This time Sir Henry Lawrence was right when he told you that “Abide with me” was one of my favou rite hymns.
('59', 222, 3, 6, 386989) 1 Though I am a devout Hindu, or even because I am a devout Hindu, I have no difficulty in appreciating the devotional hymns of other religions, and having had intimate contact with many Christians I came to appreciate some of the hymns even as a young ster.
('59', 222, 3, 7, 387248) You will perhaps be glad to know that among them “Lead,Kindly Light” is the most favourite.
('59', 222, 3, 8, 387340) But there are others also which you do not need to know.
('59', 222, 3, 9, 387397) As to the fast, let me say that you have been wholly misin formed.
('59', 222, 3, 10, 387464) My fast was not directed to a political purpose at all.
('59', 222, 3, 11, 387520) It was a purely spiritual act after the same style as Buddha’s, only upon an infinitely humbler scale.
('59', 222, 3, 12, 387623) I am sending you a new weekly which is being published this week.
('59', 222, 3, 13, 387689) In the light of your letter you might find it of some little interest.

('59', 222, 9, 19, 387894) MY DEAR CHILD, Yes.
('59', 222, 9, 20, 387914) You did keep me without a letter this time for some weeks and I was wondering why.
('59', 222, 9, 21, 387997) I must not give you a long letter this time, because the new weekly Harijan absorbs me to the exclusion of every thing else.
('59', 222, 9, 22, 388122) You will see the copy that will reach you at the same time as this.
('59', 222, 9, 23, 388190) I can quite understand what a source of pleasure Charlie Andrews’s presence must be to you and the children.

('59', 223, 5, 8, 388625) February 10, 1933
('59', 223, 6, 9, 388643) MY DEAR MARGARETE, I do hope you have been receiving my letters.
('59', 223, 6, 10, 388708) I have the lovely photographs you have sent me.
('59', 223, 6, 11, 388756) Everyone admired the album.
('59', 223, 6, 12, 388784) I am glad you are able, with the consent of your mother, to keep up your vegetarianism.
('59', 223, 6, 13, 388872) I hope the body will feel none the worse for it.
('59', 223, 6, 14, 388921) The spirit can only prosper under that simple food.
('59', 223, 6, 15, 388973) But you must not be so cock sure about your being more economical than I. You spent 5d.
('59', 223, 6, 16, 389061) on one meal.
('59', 223, 6, 17, 389074) I have made occasionally 3 meals out of 6d.
('59', 223, 6, 18, 389118) in London.
('59', 223, 6, 19, 389129) This may be in your favour that I did it when the things were cheaper than now.
('59', 223, 6, 20, 389209) I did it in London in 1890. You were not even born then, were you?
('59', 223, 6, 21, 389276) You will get by this mail the Harijan which I hope you will like.
('59', 223, 7, 22, 389342) Yours sincerely,

('59', 223, 11, 26, 389440) Stanley Jones paid me a visit the other day 1 before sailing for America.
('59', 223, 11, 27, 389514) He said that in America he would be asked many questions about the campaign against untouchability and had, therefore, some questions which he wanted me to answer.
('59', 223, 11, 28, 389678) I was glad of the visit and I readily answered his questions.
('59', 223, 11, 29, 389740) I do not propose to rep roduce the whole of our conversation and all his questions and crossquestions, but I propose to give to the readers the main questions
('59', 223, 12, 30, 389899) 1 On February 4, 1933. Mahadev Desai’s report of this meeting appeared in Mahadevbhaini Diary, “Indian Traders in Natal”, 18 11 1899
('59', 224, 0, 1, 390032) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 225
('59', 224, 1, 2, 390077) and the substance of my answers.
('59', 224, 1, 3, 390110) His first question, then, was:
('59', 224, 2, 4, 390141) Why do you restrict the movement to the removal of untouchability only?
('59', 224, 2, 5, 390213) Why not do away with the caste system altogether?
('59', 224, 2, 6, 390263) If there is a difference between caste and caste, and caste and untouchability, is it not one only of degree?
('59', 224, 3, 7, 390373) ANSWER: Untouchability as it is practised in Hinduism today is, in my opinion, a sin against God and man and is, therefore, like a poison slowly eating into the very vitals of Hinduism.
('59', 224, 3, 8, 390559) In my opinion, it has no sanction whatsoever in the Hindu Shastras taken as a whole.
('59', 224, 3, 9, 390644) Untouchability of a healthy kind is undoubtedly to be found in the Shastras and it is universal in all religions.
('59', 224, 3, 10, 390758) It is a rule of sanitation.
('59', 224, 3, 11, 390786) That will exist to the end of time; but untouchability as we are observing today in India is a hideous thing and wears various forms in various Provinces, even in districts.
('59', 224, 3, 12, 390960) It has degraded both the ‘untouchables’ and the ‘touchables’.
('59', 224, 3, 13, 391022) It has stunted the growth of nearly 40 million human beings.
('59', 224, 3, 14, 391083) They are denied even the ordinary amenities of life.
('59', 224, 3, 15, 391136) The sooner, therefore, it is ended, the better for Hinduism, the better for India and, perhaps, better for mankind in general.
('59', 224, 3, 16, 391263) Not so the caste system.
('59', 224, 3, 17, 391288) There are innumerable castes in India.
('59', 224, 3, 18, 391327) They are a social institution.
('59', 224, 3, 19, 391358) They are so many trade guilds, as was well said by the late Sir William Wilson Hunter.
('59', 224, 3, 20, 391445) And at one time they served a very useful purpose, as, perhaps, they are even now doing to a certain extent.
('59', 224, 3, 21, 391554) This institution has superadded to it restrictions which, in my opinion, are undesirable and are bound to go in course of time.
('59', 224, 3, 22, 391682) There is nothing sinful about them.
('59', 224, 3, 23, 391718) They retard the material progress of those who are labouring under them.
('59', 224, 3, 24, 391791) They are no bar to the spiritual progress.
('59', 224, 3, 25, 391834) The difference, therefore, between caste system and untouchability is not one of degree, but of kind.
('59', 224, 3, 26, 391936) An ‘untouchable’ is outside the pale of respectable society.
('59', 224, 3, 27, 391997) He is hardly treated as a human being.
('59', 224, 3, 28, 392036) He is an outcaste hurled into an abyss by his fellow beings occupying the same platform.
('59', 224, 3, 29, 392125) The difference, therefore, is somewhat analogous to the difference between heaven and hell.
('59', 224, 3, 30, 392217) There is one thing more to be remembered about the caste system.
('59', 224, 3, 31, 392282) For me, it is not the same as varnashramadharma.
('59', 224, 3, 32, 392331) Whilst the caste system is an answer to the social need, varnashrama is based upon the Hindu scriptures.
('59', 224, 3, 33, 392436) Not so the caste system.
('59', 224, 3, 34, 392461) While there are innumerable castes (some dying out and new ones coming into being), the varnas are, and have always been, four.
('59', 224, 3, 35, 392589) I am a firm believer
('59', 225, 0, 1, 392610) 226 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 225, 1, 2, 392652) in varnashrama.
('59', 225, 1, 3, 392668) I have not hesitated before now to consider it as a gift of Hinduism to mankind.
('59', 225, 1, 4, 392749) Acceptance of that dharma is, so far as I have been able to see it, a condition of spiritual growth.
('59', 225, 1, 5, 392850) But I may not here elaborate my view of these four famous divisions in Hinduism.
('59', 225, 1, 6, 392931) Their consideration is irrelevant to the present purpose.
('59', 225, 1, 7, 392989) But I may make this admission that today this varnashramadharma is not being observed in its purity.
('59', 225, 1, 8, 393090) There is an utter confusion of varna and if Hinduism is to become a living force in the world, we have to understand its real purpose and revive it; but we cannot do so, unless the canker of untouchability is destroyed.
('59', 225, 1, 9, 393310) The idea of inferiority and superiority has to be demolished.
('59', 225, 1, 10, 393372) The four divisions are not a vertical section, but a horizontal plane on which all stand on a footing of equality, doing the services respectively assigned to them.
('59', 225, 1, 11, 393537) A life of religion is not a life of privileges but of duty.
('59', 225, 1, 12, 393597) Privileges may come, as they do come to all, from a due fulfilment of duty.
('59', 225, 1, 13, 393673) In the book of God, the same number of marks are assigned to the Brahmin that has done his task well as to the Bhangi who has done likewise.
('59', 225, 1, 14, 393814) The second question was:
('59', 225, 2, 15, 393839) Why do you want temple entry for Harijans?
('59', 225, 2, 16, 393882) Are not temples the lowest thing in Hinduism?
('59', 225, 3, 17, 393928) ANSWER: I do not think so for one moment.
('59', 225, 3, 18, 393970) Temples are to Hindus what churches are to Christians.
('59', 225, 3, 19, 394025) In my opinion, we are all idolators; that in Hinduism we have images of stone or metal inside temples makes to me no difference.
('59', 225, 3, 20, 394154) Thousands of Hindus who visit temples in simple faith derive precisely the same spiritual benefit that Christians visiting churches in simple faith do.
('59', 225, 3, 21, 394306) Deprive a Hindu of his temple, and you deprive him of the thing he generally prizes most in life.
('59', 225, 3, 22, 394404) That superstition and even evil have grown round many Hindu temples is but too true.
('59', 225, 3, 23, 394489) That, however, is an argument for temple reform, not for lowering their value for Harijans or any Hindu.
('59', 225, 3, 24, 394594) It is my certain conviction that temples are an integral part of Hinduism.
('59', 225, 3, 25, 394669) His third question was:
('59', 225, 4, 26, 394693) Was not your fast pure coercion?
('59', 225, 5, 27, 394726) ANSWER: If it is agreed that my fast sprang from love, then it was coercion, only if love of parents for their children or of the latter for the former, or love of husband for wife and wife for husband, or to take a sweeping illustration, love of Jesus for those who own Him as their all, is coercion.
('59', 225, 5, 28, 395028) It is the implicit and sacred belief of millions of Christians that love of Jesus keeps them from falling and that it does
('59', 226, 0, 1, 395151) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 227
('59', 226, 1, 2, 395196) so against themselves.
('59', 226, 1, 3, 395219) His love bends the reason and the emotion of thousands of His votaries to His love.
('59', 226, 1, 4, 395303) I know that, in my childhood, love of my parents kept me from sinning, and, even after fifty years of age, love of my children and friends kept me positively from going to perdition, which I would have done most assuredly but for the definite and overwhelming influence of that love.
('59', 226, 1, 5, 395587) And, if all this love could be regarded as coercion, then the love that prompted my fast and, therefore, my fast, was coercion, but it was that in no other sense.
('59', 226, 1, 6, 395750) Fasting is a great institution in Hinduism, as perhaps in no other religion, and, though it has been abused by people not entitled to fast, it has, on the whole, done the greatest good to Hinduism.
('59', 226, 1, 7, 395948) I believe that there is no prayer without fasting and there is no real fast without prayer.
('59', 226, 1, 8, 396040) My fast was the prayer of a soul in agony.

('59', 226, 4, 12, 396130) The following has just been received from Dr. Ambedkar:
('59', 226, 5, 13, 396186) At the end of our conversation 1 on Saturday last you asked me to send a message for insertion in the first issue of your new weekly Harijan.
('59', 226, 5, 14, 396328) I feel I cannot give a message.
('59', 226, 5, 15, 396360) For I believe it will be a most unwarranted presumption on my part to suppose that I have sufficient worth in the eyes of the Hindus which would make them treat any message from me with respect.
('59', 226, 5, 16, 396555) I can only speak as man to man.
('59', 226, 5, 17, 396587) As such it may be desirable that the Hindus should know my views on the momentous issue of Hindu social organization with which you have chosen to occupy yourself.
('59', 226, 5, 18, 396751) I am, therefore, sending you the accompanying statement for publication in your Harijan.
('59', 226, 6, 19, 396840) STATEMENT
('59', 226, 7, 20, 396850) The outcaste is a bye product of the caste system.
('59', 226, 7, 21, 396901) There will be outcastes as long as there are castes.
('59', 226, 7, 22, 396954) Nothing can emancipate the outcaste except the destruction of the caste system.
('59', 226, 7, 23, 397034) Nothing can help to save Hindus and ensure their survival in the coming struggle except the purging of the Hindu faith of this odious and vicious dogma.

('59', 227, 0, 1, 397301) 228 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 227, 1, 2, 397343) Dr. Ambedkar is bitter.
('59', 227, 1, 3, 397367) He has every reason to feel so.
('59', 227, 1, 4, 397399) He has received a liberal education.
('59', 227, 1, 5, 397436) He has more than the talents of the average educated Indian.
('59', 227, 1, 6, 397497) Outside India he is received with honour and affection, but, in India, among Hindus, at every step he is reminded that he is one of the outcastes of Hindu society.
('59', 227, 1, 7, 397661) It is nothing to his shame, for, he has done no wrong to Hindu society.
('59', 227, 1, 8, 397733) His exterior is as clean as that of the cleanest and the proudest Brahmin.
('59', 227, 1, 9, 397808) Of his interior, the world knows as little as of that of any of us.
('59', 227, 1, 10, 397876) In spite of all this, he believes that ‘it will be a most unwarranted presumption on his part to suppose that he has sufficient worth in the eyes of the Hindus which would make them treat any message from him with respect’.
('59', 227, 1, 11, 398100) This is the caste Hindus’ shame, not his, but I would like him to feel that there are today thousands of caste Hindus who would listen to his message with the same respect and consideration that they would give to that of any other leader and that in their estimation there is no person high and no person low.
('59', 227, 1, 12, 398411) I would like him, too, to know that Harijan is not my weekly.
('59', 227, 1, 13, 398473) So far as the proprietary rights are concerned it belongs to the Servants of Untouchables Society and, therefore, I would like him to feel that it is as much his as of any other Hindu.
('59', 227, 1, 14, 398658) As to the burden of his message, the opinion he holds about the caste system is shared by many educated Hindus.
('59', 227, 1, 15, 398770) I have not, however, been able to share that opinion.
('59', 227, 1, 16, 398824) I do not believe the caste system, even as distinguished from varnashrama, to be an ‘odious and vicious dogma’.
('59', 227, 1, 17, 398936) It has its limitations and its defects, but there is nothing sinful about it, as there is about untouchability, and, if it is a bye product of the caste system it is only in the same sense that an ugly growth is of a body, or weeds of a crop.
('59', 227, 1, 18, 399179) It is as wrong to destroy caste because of the outcastes as it would be to destroy a body because of an ugly growth in it, or a crop because of the weeds.
('59', 227, 1, 19, 399334) The outcasteness, in the sense we understand it, has, therefore, to be destroyed altogether.
('59', 227, 1, 20, 399427) It is an excess to be removed, if the whole system is not to perish.
('59', 227, 1, 21, 399496) Untouchability is the product, therefore, not of the caste system, but of the distinction of high and low that has crept into Hinduism and is corroding it.
('59', 227, 1, 22, 399652) The attack on untouchability is thus an attack upon this ‘high and low’ness.
('59', 227, 1, 23, 399729) The moment untouchability goes, the caste system itself will be purified, that is to say, according to my dream, it will resolve itself into the true varnadharma, the four divisions of society, each complementary of the other and none inferior or superior to any other, each as necessary for

('59', 228, 1, 2, 400066) the whole body of Hinduism as any other.
('59', 228, 1, 3, 400107) How it can be and what that varnashrama is, it is not necessary to examine here.
('59', 228, 1, 4, 400188) But, such being my faith, I have always respectfully differed from those distinguished countrymen, Dr. Ambedkar among them, who have held that untouchability will not go without the destruction of varnashramadharma.
('59', 228, 1, 5, 400404) They have made no distinction between caste and varna.
('59', 228, 1, 6, 400459) But that is another story.
('59', 228, 1, 7, 400486) At the present moment, it is the ‘untouchable’, the outcaste, with whom all Hindu reformers, whether they believe in varnashrama or not, have agreed to deal.
('59', 228, 1, 8, 400644) The opposition to untouchability is common to both.
('59', 228, 1, 9, 400696) Therefore, the present joint fight is restricted to the removal of untouchability, and I would invite Dr. Ambedkar and those who think with him to throw themselves, heart and soul, into the campaign against the monster of untouchability.
('59', 228, 1, 10, 400934) It is highly likely that at the end of it we shall all find that there is nothing to fight against in varnashrama.
('59', 228, 1, 11, 401049) If however, varnashrama even then looks an ugly thing, the whole of Hindu society will fight it.
('59', 228, 1, 12, 401146) For this campaign against untouchability is not one of compulsion, but conversion.
('59', 228, 1, 13, 401229) At the end of the chapter, I hope that we shall all find ourselves in the same camp.
('59', 228, 1, 14, 401314) Should it prove otherwise, it will be time enough to consider how and by whom varnashrama is to be fought.

('59', 228, 3, 16, 401440) 329. UNTOUCHABILITY
('59', 228, 4, 17, 401460) Untouchability as at present practised is the greatest blot on Hinduism.
('59', 228, 4, 18, 401533) It is (with apologies to sanatanists) against the Shastras.
('59', 228, 4, 19, 401593) It is against the fundamental principles of humanity, it is against the dictates of reason that a man should, by mere reason of birth, be for ever regarded as an untouchable, even unapproachable and unseeable.
('59', 228, 4, 20, 401803) These adjectives do not convey the full meaning of the thing itself.
('59', 228, 4, 21, 401872) It is a crime for certain men, women and their children to touch, or to approach within stated distances, or to be seen by those who are called caste Hindus.
('59', 228, 4, 22, 402030) The tragedy is that millions of Hindus believe in this institution as if it was enjoined by the Hindu religion.
('59', 228, 5, 23, 402142) Happily, Hindu reformers have recoiled with horror from this practice.
('59', 228, 5, 24, 402213) They have come to the conclusion that it has no support in the Hindu Shastras taken as a whole.
('59', 228, 5, 25, 402309) Isolated texts torn from their context and considered by themselves can no doubt be produced in
('59', 229, 0, 1, 402405) 230 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 229, 1, 2, 402447) support of this practice, as of any evil known to mankind.
('59', 229, 1, 3, 402506) But there is abundant authority in the Shastras to warrant the summary rejection, as being un Hindu, of anything or any practice that is manifestly against the fundamental principles of humanity or morality, of ahimsa or satya 1. This movement against untouchability has been daily gathering strength.
('59', 229, 1, 4, 402808) It was in last September that leading Hindus, claiming to represent the whole of Hindu India, met together and unanimously passed a Resolution 2, condemning untouchability and pledging themselves to abolish it by law, if possible even during the existing regime, and, failing that, when India had a Parliament of her own.
('59', 229, 1, 5, 403130) Among the marks of untouchability to be removed was the prohibition against temple entry by Harijans.
('59', 229, 1, 6, 403232) In the course of the struggle, it was discovered that the British Courts in India had recognized this evil custom, so much so that certain acts done by untouchables as such came to be offences under the British Indian Penal Code.
('59', 229, 1, 7, 403462) Thus, the entry by an untouchable into a Hindu temple would be punishable as a crime under the I.P.C Before, therefore, the movement of temple entry can make headway, it has become imperative to have this anomaly removed.
('59', 229, 1, 8, 403684) It is for this purpose that Sjt.
('59', 229, 1, 9, 403717) Ranga Iyer has given notice of two Bills to be introduced in the Central Legislature.
('59', 229, 1, 10, 403803) After ascertaining the opinion of the Provincial Governments, H.E. the Viceroy has sanctioned the introduction of these Bills.
('59', 229, 1, 11, 403930) But, being private Bills, they have a poor chance of becoming the law of the land, unless the Gove rnment and the members of the Assembly refrain from obstructing its consideration.
('59', 229, 1, 12, 404112) It may be argued that, being pledged to neutrality in matters of religion, the Government are bound to facilitate the passage of the first Bill at any rate, inasmuch as it merely seeks to undo the effect produced by the decisions of British Indian Courts, and this it does by withdrawing legal recognition from untouchability.
('59', 229, 1, 13, 404439) There are practices in various religions professed by the inhabitants of this land whose breach is not regarded as criminal, though it would be regarded as very serious by the respective religious codes.
('59', 229, 1, 14, 404643) Thus, beef eating by a Hindu is an offence in the eye of the Hindu religious code, but rightly not punishable as a crime under the

('59', 230, 1, 2, 404871) Indian Penal Code.
('59', 230, 1, 3, 404890) Is there, then, any reason why the common law of India should punish a breach of the custom of untouchability?
('59', 230, 1, 4, 405001) If there are many Hindus learned in the Hindu scriptures who find support in them for the present practice of untouchability, there are quite a number of equally learned Hindus holding the opposite view.
('59', 230, 1, 5, 405205) Though this opinion of the pandits has already appeared in the Press, it is reproduced elsewhere for ready reference.
('59', 230, 1, 6, 405323) Let it be noted that the signatories are all orthodox Hindus, as much lovers of their faith as are the learned men of the opposite school.
('59', 230, 1, 7, 405462) On the 25th of January 1933 was held the session of the All India Sanatan Dharma Sabha, presided over by Pandit Malaviyaji and attended by over one hundred learned men.
('59', 230, 1, 8, 405631) It passed a resolution to the effect that Harijans were as much entitled to temple entry as the rest of the Hindus.
('59', 230, 1, 9, 405747) If the Bills are not passed, it is obvious that the central part of the reform will be hung up almost indefinitely.
('59', 230, 1, 10, 405863) Neutrality in matters of religion ought not to mean religious stagnation and hindrance to reform.With due regard to the sanatanists, it is difficult to understand the cry of ‘religion in danger’.
('59', 230, 1, 11, 406059) Under neither Bill will a single temple be opened against the will of the majority of temple goers in question.
('59', 230, 1, 12, 406171) The second Bill expressly says so.
('59', 230, 1, 13, 406206) The first Bill takes up a neutral attitude.
('59', 230, 1, 14, 406250) It does not help a Harijan to force his way into a temple.
('59', 230, 1, 15, 406309) The reformers do not seek to compel the opponents to their will.
('59', 230, 1, 16, 406374) They desire, by the fairest means possible, to convert the majority or the minority, as the case may be, to their view of untouchability.
('59', 230, 1, 17, 406512) It is said that the Harijans themselves do not want temple entry and that they want only betterment of their economic and political condition.
('59', 230, 1, 18, 406655) The reformer, too, wants the latter, but he believes that this betterment will be much quicker brought about, if religious equality is attained.
('59', 230, 1, 19, 406800) The reformer denies that the Harijans do not want temple entry.
('59', 230, 1, 20, 406864) But it may be that they are so disgusted with caste Hindus and Hindu religion itself as to want nothing from them.
('59', 230, 1, 21, 406979) They may in sullen discontent choose to remain outside the religious pale.
('59', 230, 1, 22, 407054) Any penance on the part of caste Hindus may be too late.
('59', 230, 1, 23, 407111) Nevertheless, the caste Hindus who recognize that untouchability is a blot on Hinduism have to atone for the sin of untouchability.
('59', 230, 1, 24, 407243) Whether, therefore, Harijans desire temple entry or not, caste Hindus have to open their temples to Harijans, precisely on the same terms as to other Hindus.
('59', 230, 1, 25, 407401) For a caste Hindu with any sense of honour, temple prohibition is a continuous breach of the pledge taken at the Bombay

('59', 231, 1, 3, 407590) Those, who gave their word to the world and to God that they would have the temples opened for the Harijans, have to sacrifice their all, if need be, for redeeming the pledge.
('59', 231, 1, 4, 407766) It may be that they did not represent the Hindu mind.
('59', 231, 1, 5, 407820) They have, then, to own defeat and do the proper penance.
('59', 231, 1, 6, 407878) Temple entry is the one spiritual act that would constitute the message of freedom to the untouchables and assure them that they are not outcastes before God.

('59', 231, 3, 8, 408056) 330. TO THE READER
('59', 231, 4, 9, 408075) The English edition of Harijan is being published by and for the Servants of Untouchables Society at my request and, therefore, in accordance with the views I have long held regarding reform journals.
('59', 231, 4, 10, 408276) It is being published on the assumption that 1. unfortunately, the Hindi edition cannot as yet serve the South and probably, Bengal, 2. it is necessary for the people in the different Provinces to know the progress of the reform from week to week in the Provinces other than their own, 3. since the movement, though essentially Hindu, has a world wide significance and seeks the sympathy, if possible, of the whole of humanity, it is necessary to keep the world acquainted with its implica tions and progress.
('59', 231, 4, 11, 408786) If these assumptions are correct, Harijan will supply a felt want and should, therefore, become self supporting.
('59', 231, 4, 12, 408899) If it does not, it must stop publication.
('59', 231, 4, 13, 408941) If it is published at a loss, it will mean so much money taken from the mouths of Harijans.
('59', 231, 4, 14, 409033) An endeavour is being made to expend every pice of subscription received on behalf of the Society for the sole service of Harijans and the advance of the movement for the removal of untouchability.
('59', 231, 4, 15, 409231) You will note that no advertisements are being taken for the upkeep of the paper.
('59', 231, 4, 16, 409313) It has to depend solely upon the subscriptions received.
('59', 231, 4, 17, 409370) You can send the subscription for yourself or your friends, Indian or foreign, or for institutions, such as libraries, or for poor and deserving Harijans.
('59', 231, 4, 18, 409525) Ten thousand copies are being printed for the time being.
('59', 232, 0, 1, 409583) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 233
('59', 232, 1, 2, 409628) copies will be sent free, either by way of compliment or exchange, but the list can only be limited.
('59', 232, 1, 3, 409729) It is possible for you to extend it.
('59', 232, 1, 4, 409766) I would like every English knowing Harijan student and every untouchability worker to have a free copy on a certified application.
('59', 232, 1, 5, 409897) This is possible only through the active co operation of the reader who can afford to pay more than his own subscription.
('59', 232, 1, 6, 410019) The provincial organizations should send and pay for their own copies of which they should send advice in time, accompanying it with cheques or money orders.
('59', 232, 1, 7, 410177) So much for the financial part of this appeal.
('59', 232, 1, 8, 410224) That part of your obligation I know you will fulfil, if you are a reformer.
('59', 232, 1, 9, 410300) But the harder is the necessary consequence of your fulfilment of that part.
('59', 232, 1, 10, 410377) By paying subscriptions for yourself or others, you buy the right of, and recognize the duty of, serving the great cause in every legitimate manner possible for you.
('59', 232, 1, 11, 410543) Thus, you can become an active helper in spreading the message of Harijan among those who are opposing the reform.
('59', 232, 1, 12, 410658) This requires special qualifi cations.
('59', 232, 1, 13, 410697) You need to have self restraint.
('59', 232, 1, 14, 410730) The opponents are in a state of rage just now.
('59', 232, 1, 15, 410777) Some of them believe that sanatana dharma is in danger, as it has never been before.
('59', 232, 1, 16, 410862) They imagine much more than the reform means and, therefore, do not hesitate to ascribe motives to reformers.
('59', 232, 1, 17, 410972) You have, by your gentleness and gentlemanliness, to disarm suspicions and enable them to understand what the reform means.
('59', 232, 1, 18, 411096) If you will diligently study Harijan, it will equip you for the delicate task.
('59', 232, 1, 19, 411175) It will give you an epitome of the week’s doings in the various parts of India in connection with the campaign against untouchability.
('59', 232, 1, 20, 411310) It will also tell you what the others are doing and what the opponents are saying.
('59', 232, 1, 21, 411393) It will also lay bare the weaknesses and mistakes of workers.
('59', 232, 1, 22, 411455) Will you become a fellow worker in this movement of liberating over forty million human beings from an intolerable yoke and of purifying Hinduism?
('59', 232, 1, 23, 411602) But I do not despair of even some opponents subscribing to Harijan.
('59', 232, 1, 24, 411670) I am an irrepressible optimist.
('59', 232, 1, 25, 411702) I have no quarrel with the opponents.
('59', 232, 1, 26, 411740) These pages will be written as much for them as for the reformers.
('59', 232, 1, 27, 411807) If Harijan stands for truth and if the reformers have patience, the opponents of today will be the reformers of tomorrow.

('59', 233, 1, 2, 411990) 331. WHY ‘HARIJAN’
('59', 233, 2, 3, 412009) Several correspondents have asked me why I have adopted the name ‘Harijan’ for ‘untouchable’.
('59', 233, 2, 4, 412103) Some English friends have asked me for its meaning.
('59', 233, 2, 5, 412155) It is not a name of my coining.
('59', 233, 2, 6, 412187) Some years ago, several ‘untouchable, correspondents complained that I used the word asprishya in the pages of Navajivan 1. Asprishya means literally untouchable.
('59', 233, 2, 7, 412350) I then invited them to suggest a better name and one of the ‘untouchable, correspondents suggested the adoption of the name ‘Harijan’, on the strength of its having been used by the first known poet saint of Gujarat.
('59', 233, 2, 8, 412567) Though the quotation he sent me did not exactly fit the case he wanted to make out for the adoption, I thought that it was a good word.
('59', 233, 2, 9, 412703) ‘Harijan’ means ‘a man of God’.
('59', 233, 2, 10, 412735) All the religions of the world described God pre eminently as the Friend of the friendless, Help of the helpless and Protector of the weak.
('59', 233, 2, 11, 412875) The rest of the world apart, in India who can be more friendless, helpless or weaker than the forty million or more Hindus of India who are classified as untouchables?
('59', 233, 2, 12, 413043) If, therefore, any body of people can be fitly described as men of God, they are surely these helpless, friendless and despised people.
('59', 233, 2, 13, 413179) Hence, in the pages of Navajivan, since the correspondence, I have always adopted Harijan as the name signifying untouchables.
('59', 233, 2, 14, 413306) And, when God chose to entrust me with their service even whilst undergoing imprisonment, I could not use any other word for describing them.
('59', 233, 2, 15, 413448) I recoil with horror from that word and all it implies.
('59', 233, 2, 16, 413504) Not that the change of name brings about any change of status, but one may at least be spared the use of a term which is itself one of reproach.
('59', 233, 2, 17, 413649) When caste Hindus have of their own inner conviction and, therefore, voluntarily got rid of the present day untouchability, we shall all be called Harijans, for, according to my humble opinion, caste Hindus will then have found favour with God and may, therefore, be fitly described as His men.

('59', 234, 2, 3, 414060) Several friends have written to me letters asking me in substance the following question: Why is it that you, who have always sworn by non co operation with the Government and Legislatures, are now carrying on propaganda for the passage of untouchability Bills by the present Legislatures, and are thus co operating with both the Government and the Legislatures?
('59', 234, 2, 4, 414423) Newspaper reporters also have been plying me with the same question.
('59', 234, 2, 5, 414492) I have evaded both by saying that I cannot, consistently with my obligation as a prisoner, deal with this question as fully as I would like to.
('59', 234, 2, 6, 414636) But I can say this much, that there is no doctrine in the world which admits of the same kind of application under every variety of circumstance.
('59', 234, 2, 7, 414782) Different circumstances evoke different applications of the same doctrine.
('59', 234, 2, 8, 414857) Thus, my love for a starving man would require me to feed him.
('59', 234, 2, 9, 414920) My love for my overfed child would require me to starve him, even though he may be crying for food.
('59', 234, 2, 10, 415020) I am today non co operating with sanatanist friends, but I would like my questioners to analyse my non co operation, and they will find that in the very act of non co operation I am seeking their co operation in my campaign.
('59', 234, 2, 11, 415245) Exactly in the same manner, I may non co operate as much as I like with Government or any institution, but I would be a very foolish man, if I did not know that I was non co operating in order to secure co operation from them.
('59', 234, 2, 12, 415472) Thus, I am now seeking the co operation of the Government and the Legislatures in order to further my purpose, which I hold to be very sacred and altogether good.
('59', 234, 2, 13, 415635) Beyond this I may not go, for the reason I have already stated and which the reader should respect.

('59', 235, 2, 3, 415825) Hiralal A. Shah writes: 1
('59', 235, 3, 4, 415851) The suggestion made by Sjt.
('59', 235, 3, 5, 415879) Shah is certainly worthy of consideration as well by municipalities and local bodies as by individuals, but particularly by the former.
('59', 235, 3, 6, 416015) Corporate cleanliness can only be ensured, if there is a corporate conscience and a corporate insistence on cleanliness in public places.
('59', 235, 3, 7, 416153) Untouchability has a great deal to answer for the insanitation of our streets and our latrines, whether private or public.
('59', 235, 3, 8, 416276) In its inception, untouchability was a rule of sanitation, and still is in all parts of the world outside India.
('59', 235, 3, 9, 416389) That is to say, an unclean person or thing is untouchable, but immediately his or its uncleanliness is shed, he or it is no longer untouchable.
('59', 235, 3, 10, 416533) Therefore, a person who is to attend to scavenging, whether it is a paid Bhangi or an unpaid mother, they are unclean until they have washed themselves clean of their unclean work.
('59', 235, 3, 11, 416714) If, instead of being regarded as untouchable for ever, the Bhangi was treated as brother and was given an opportunity and even made to become clean after performing an unclean service for society, he should be as acceptable as any other member of that society.
('59', 235, 3, 12, 416975) Corporations can, therefore, lead the way in this matter, but they will not unless the citizens insist.
('59', 235, 3, 13, 417079) It is truly said that Corporations have no souls, that is, apart from the souls of the citizens.
('59', 235, 3, 14, 417176) Whilst, therefore, commending Sjt.
('59', 235, 3, 15, 417211) Shah’s suggestion to all concerned, I would advise him to concentrate his energy upon one single spot and there agitate, both amongst the public and their Corporation, for the much needed reform.
('59', 235, 3, 16, 417407) Let him, therefore, devote every ounce of his spare energy to educating public opinion in Bombay, where he has his habitation, evolve concrete suggestions and get them accepted by the people in the different wards, and he will soon find that his labours are crowned with success.

('59', 236, 2, 3, 417947) February 11, 1933
('59', 236, 3, 4, 417965) DEAR SIR, On the 8th instant Major Bhandari communicated to me the information that Government had decided to withhold a letter addressed to me by Appasaheb Patwardhan.
('59', 236, 3, 5, 418134) The next morning I saw in The Times of India a paragraph to the effect that Appasaheb had put himself on reduced rations.
('59', 236, 3, 6, 418256) Thereupon the same day I wrote 1 to Col.
('59', 236, 3, 7, 418297) Doyle inquiring about the news and asking to know the orders of the Government of India about conservancy work in the prisons by volunteer prisoners.
('59', 236, 3, 8, 418447) Not having any reply I sent yesterday a reminder.
('59', 236, 3, 9, 418497) 2 Since then I have a copy of the orders of the Government of India, but no reply to my inquiry about Appasaheb.
('59', 236, 3, 10, 418610) For me the matter is of the gravest importance involving my honour.
('59', 236, 3, 11, 418678) As a result of the protracted correspondence between the authorities and me there was a settlement about the subject matter thereof and at the instance of Col.
('59', 236, 3, 12, 418838) Doyle I sent the following wire 3 to Appasaheb Patwardhan on the 6th December last.
('59', 236, 3, 13, 418922) It clearly foreshadows resumption of fast by him in the event of an unfavourable decision.
('59', 236, 3, 14, 419013) The Government will observe that any decision in this matter that affects Appasaheb affects me equally.
('59', 236, 3, 15, 419117) As I read the whole of the transactions between December 1st and now in this matter, the Government have recognized the correctness of my action.
('59', 236, 3, 16, 419263) I hope that they do not now intend to revise their attitude and cut me off from Appasaheb.
('59', 236, 3, 17, 419354) For the moment therefore I ask whether Appasaheb is or very recently had been on a partial fast and whether he and his comrades have been now permitted to do conservancy work.
('59', 236, 3, 18, 419530) Owing to the increasing tension caused by the report of Appasaheb’s partial fast, I am requesting Major Bhandari, if he has authority, or to request Col.

('59', 237, 10, 14, 420571) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter and I appreciate it.
('59', 237, 10, 15, 420633) Beyond what I have said in the columns of the Harijan, it is not possible for me to go and yet not commit breach of faith.
('59', 237, 10, 16, 420756) therefore the article in Harijan “Seeking or Giving” 2, does not convince you, I can only ask you to be patient with me and still give your whole hearted service to the cause of Harijans.
('59', 237, 10, 17, 420944) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('59', 238, 12, 19, 422040) February 11, 1933
('59', 238, 13, 20, 422058) DEAR RAMANANDA BABOO, I thank you for taking so much trouble over my letter of the 20th ultimo about the Yeravda Pact.
('59', 238, 13, 21, 422177) I had read all that appeared in the
('59', 238, 14, 22, 422213) 1 Gandhiji’s co worker in Champaran; vide
('59', 238, 15, 23, 422255) 2 Report of a lecture by Sophia Wadia
('59', 239, 0, 1, 422293) 240 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 239, 1, 2, 422335) Modern Review 1 on the Pact and I wish that I had spared you the trouble of sending me copies by telling you that I had read them and asking you if you had any further comments to offer on the matter in view of the agitation set up in Bengal.
('59', 239, 1, 3, 422578) I am not so bad as I used to be out of prison.
('59', 239, 1, 4, 422625) Then, I had not a moment to read even the Modern Review let alone other magazines and papers.
('59', 239, 1, 5, 422719) Inside the prison hitherto I have had time to read the Modern Review which you have been so kindly and punctually sending me from month to month.
('59', 239, 2, 6, 422865) The argument in your letter 2 is quite clear to me though it does not convince me.
('59', 239, 2, 7, 422948) I was surprised even when I read your note on the Yeravda Pact.
('59', 239, 2, 8, 423012) For I had heard that you had been party to the statement made by Dr. Moonje that so far as Hindu Sabha was concerned he was quite willing that cent per cent seats were given to the depressed classes, and I was glad when I read the statement and still more so when I heard that you had heartily approved of it.
('59', 239, 3, 9, 423322) My own position is fundamentally different from yours.
('59', 239, 3, 10, 423377) If there was to be any reservation at all, and I saw that there had to be, we could not afford to give it in a niggardly spirit.
('59', 239, 3, 11, 423506) We were bound to give as many seats as Harijan representatives desired and certainly up to their numerical strength.
('59', 239, 3, 12, 423623) My action was based on absolute trust.
('59', 239, 3, 13, 423662) If we have to suffer for it no one will be to blame but ourselves.
('59', 239, 3, 14, 423729) We can never suffer if we will be only strictly just to them.
('59', 239, 3, 15, 423791) We can never be generous, for there is no danger for years to come of our giving them too much.
('59', 239, 3, 16, 423887) I wish that I can persuade every caste Hindu as to the measure of the enormity of the wrong done by them to Harijans.
('59', 239, 3, 17, 424005) Nor do I mind many who have hitherto described themselves as caste Hindus rushing to the registering officers to be classified as Harijans.
('59', 239, 3, 18, 424145) I do not mind because daily we must be advancing towards effacement of the vicious distinction between caste Hindus and outcastes, so much
('59', 239, 4, 19, 424284) 1 Of Octobers, 1932 2 Wherein the addressee had written: “My individual opinion is against the Poona Pact, so far as it relates to Bengal .
('59', 239, 4, 20, 424424) Reservation of seats for the depressed will not help the really “depressed” or “untouchable” people.
('59', 239, 4, 21, 424525) The present “depressed” class M.L.C.s generally oppose nationalist parties and side with the pro bureaucracy Mussalmans.
('59', 239, 4, 22, 424646) Giving 30 seats out of 80 to the depressed castes would mean the practical wiping out of a nationalist opposition party in the future Bengal Council.
('59', 239, 4, 23, 424796) .” (S. N. 20155).

('59', 240, 1, 2, 424859) so that it would be a privilege for a caste Hindu to be classified as Harijan.
('59', 240, 1, 3, 424938) Indeed, in my opinion Bengal is in a better position than the other Provinces, if it is true that there are very few untouchables in the real sense of the term and I think that it is true but that many are classed as such because they are economically depressed and are suffering from other social disabilities than untouchability.
('59', 240, 1, 4, 425270) So far as I am concerned, let all, everywhere, who are at all economically depressed and are suffering from any social disability get themselves registered as Harijans, if to be registered as Harijans is an optional act.
('59', 240, 1, 5, 425491) That very fact will be a factor in the removal of untouchability instead of, as you fear, in hardening it.
('59', 240, 1, 6, 425598) Lastly, I do not share your fear that in many elections only those who may be called advanced Harijans will be elected.
('59', 240, 1, 7, 425718) That and many other things will undoubtedly happen if the reformer either goes to sleep or is insincere.
('59', 240, 1, 8, 425823) If he is sincere and active, untouchability will be a dying cult and those who are lowest in the social scale and intelligence will get their due.
('59', 240, 1, 9, 425970) And if at the bottom of all your arguments and fears there is the suspicion that the reformer is not all that one would desire it to be, for a moment, but only for a moment, I would be tempted to share that suspicion, but I am a born optimist.
('59', 240, 1, 10, 426214) I have faith in my sincerity and activity.
('59', 240, 1, 11, 426257) Therefore I refuse to suspect my comrades.
('59', 240, 1, 12, 426300) Hence the counter arguments that I have advanced.
('59', 240, 1, 13, 426350) I would invite you to share my faith in the reform and the reformers and believe with me that if we are true the Harijans will be true and all will be well.
('59', 240, 1, 14, 426507) If you find nothing in my letter that appeals to you I would like you to strive with me and tear my argument to pieces.
('59', 240, 1, 15, 426627) You know the regard I have for you.
('59', 240, 1, 16, 426663) If it admits of enhancement it would only be enhanced by your frank and fearless criticism.
('59', 240, 1, 17, 426755) I am anxious that we approach the Yeravda Pact and all it means with perfect confidence in its correctness.

('59', 242, 3, 4, 428302) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter of the 6th instant.
('59', 242, 3, 5, 428363) I have never believed that the problem of untouchability can be solved by mere temple entry.
('59', 242, 3, 6, 428456) But I do believe that it can never be solved without temple entry on equal terms with the others, and I further believe that the economic and educational advance can be accelerated by temple entry which is really the mark of the removal of untouchability.
('59', 242, 3, 7, 428712) One may be ever so educated and ever so rich and yet be untouchable, but immediately he has got religious equality through temple entry, untouchability is gone.
('59', 242, 3, 8, 428873) At the same time, I believe with you that the educational and economic advance must not be neglected nor subordinated to temple entry.
('59', 242, 3, 9, 429008) As a matter of fact, that isbeing prosecuted [as] vigorously as it is possible to do.

('59', 242, 8, 16, 429333) It was very good.
('59', 242, 8, 17, 429351) Those who recite Gita give up any worry whatsoever.
('59', 242, 8, 18, 429403) I do know that your fits are caused by some worry or other.
('59', 242, 8, 19, 429463) If you need to write every fortnight to Jayaprakash you must write only to him and he can send me the news.
('59', 242, 8, 20, 429571) If a monthly letter is sufficient for him it will be enough if I too may receive one in the month.

('59', 243, 1, 4, 429956) It was excellent that you were given the job of teaching.
('59', 243, 1, 5, 430014) Inform Kanta that I deliberately refrain from writing to her so that she may receive the essential mail due to her without any hindrance.
('59', 243, 1, 6, 430152) Her news I continue to get through Sumangal.
('59', 243, 1, 7, 430197) Mrityunjaya and Vidyavati do not even write to me but I get the news about Father’s health.
('59', 243, 1, 8, 430289) There was no serious complaint about the women inmates of the Ashram; anyway neither your nor Kanta’s name was mentioned in it.
('59', 243, 1, 9, 430417) My work certainly goes on increasing, but I do have some help now that Chhaganbhai is here.

('59', 243, 1, 17, 430785) The weight hovers around 103 lb.
('59', 243, 1, 18, 430818) The pain in the elbow has become chronic.
('59', 243, 1, 19, 430860) It should not cause any anxiety.
('59', 243, 1, 20, 430893) I can spin every day but not much.
('59', 243, 1, 21, 430928) It is about 100 rounds.
('59', 243, 1, 22, 430952) Sardar, Mahadev and Chhaganlal are all doing well.

('59', 244, 4, 6, 431819) I do not know how you
('59', 244, 5, 7, 431841) will distribute them, but I suppose you can think of better ways than I can suggest from here.
('59', 244, 5, 8, 431936) From among the friends in the mofussil you will please have as many subscribers as possible and get newsboys to do the street sales.
('59', 244, 5, 9, 432069) I do not know if you will want the Khadi Pratishthan to act as agents.
('59', 244, 5, 10, 432140) But if you feel that the Pratishthan cannot undertake the work, please try to get as many subscribers as possible and collect the money and send a cheque for the amount and save so much money for the Harijan.
('59', 244, 5, 11, 432349) In case you would have the Pratishthan to take up the agency please let the

('59', 245, 2, 3, 433455) February 12, 1933
('59', 245, 3, 4, 433473) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter for which I thank you.
('59', 245, 3, 5, 433528) The idea of a separate university for Harijans is attractive, but it is hardly necessary to create a separate university.
('59', 245, 3, 6, 433650) In the place of that we have Mr. David’s scheme of which you must have already read and of which you will see a little more in last week’s Harijan.
('59', 245, 3, 7, 433798) It is elastic and economical in the sense that every rupee obtained under the scheme goes directly for the tuition of Harijans and it is also the quickest method of giving higher education to selected Harijan students.
('59', 245, 3, 8, 434017) If Mr. David’s scheme proves successful, there should be no difficulty in extending it so as to cover a further selection of students for being sent to foreign countries.
('59', 245, 3, 9, 434188) Industrial education too I should treat precisely in the same manner as I would treat higher education.
('59', 245, 3, 10, 434292) Of cinema shows I understand but little, having never attended any.
('59', 245, 3, 11, 434360) An attempt is already being made to induce the better classes to engage Harijans as domestic servants and I think it is coming.
('59', 245, 3, 12, 434488) As to the caste system, I would commend the last week’s issue of Harijan to your attention for my views.
('59', 245, 3, 13, 434593) I think this answers all your questions.
('59', 245, 3, 14, 434634) I take it that you have sent a copy of your letter to the Central Board or at least a similar letter, if not a copy.
('59', 245, 4, 15, 434751) Yours sincerely G. M. THAWARE ASST.

('59', 246, 2, 3, 434926) February 12, 1933
('59', 246, 3, 4, 434944) DEAR N., Kumar Diwakar Singh whom you call Devula gave me your note.
('59', 246, 3, 5, 435013) Your way of addressing me as your son is very strange.
('59', 246, 3, 6, 435068) I lost my mother years ago.
('59', 246, 3, 7, 435096) I am fast making daughters and sisters.
('59', 246, 3, 8, 435136) But mother I have not found.
('59', 246, 3, 9, 435165) Age is no bar.
('59', 246, 3, 10, 435180) If you can inspire me with mother worship towards you nothing would please me better.
('59', 246, 3, 11, 435266) But let me say that your letter before me has filled me with misgivings.
('59', 246, 3, 12, 435339) It smells of the hysteric.
('59', 246, 3, 13, 435366) Your judgment of the friend whom you have sent is not confirmed by my talks with him.
('59', 246, 3, 14, 435452) He seems to me to be a youth of unbalanced mind.
('59', 246, 3, 15, 435501) He is not likely to do much in Allahabad.
('59', 246, 3, 16, 435543) But more serious still is the attack upon your character that came to me yesterday from an unexpected source.
('59', 246, 3, 17, 435653) The friend who gave me the warning is a man of great worth and has no end to serve by misleading me.
('59', 246, 3, 18, 435754) He simply warns me against my playing into your hands; of course the friend has no first hand information.
('59', 246, 3, 19, 435861) But it is against my nature to keep such reports from those of whom I have them and in whose welfare I may be interested as I am in yours.
('59', 246, 3, 20, 436000) Your first letters prepossessed me in your favour and I thought that I could use you for the common service of Truth.
('59', 246, 3, 21, 436118) This report coupled with your latest letter have created a doubt in my mind.
('59', 246, 3, 22, 436195) I should hope that it has no solid foundation.
('59', 246, 3, 23, 436242) If you have any care for my opinion, you will lay aside all work and without trumpet come to Poona, leave your luggage at the station and come to me any day after 9 a.m.
('59', 246, 3, 24, 436412) and let me see you face to face and ask you some straight questions.
('59', 246, 4, 25, 436481) Yours sincerely,

('59', 247, 3, 6, 436643) SHARMA, I was glad to have your letter.
('59', 247, 3, 7, 436683) 1 Amtussalaam being with you puts me at ease.
('59', 247, 3, 8, 436729) She has such great faith in your ability to cure her.
('59', 247, 3, 9, 436783) I do hope that she will be thoroughly restored to health.
('59', 247, 3, 10, 436841) I hope that your troubles will be soon over.
('59', 247, 3, 11, 436886) I am glad you are preparing yourself for the Ashram life.
('59', 247, 3, 12, 436944) It will please me greatly if you could go to the Ashram.

('59', 247, 6, 15, 437088) [February] 2 12, 1933
('59', 247, 7, 16, 437110) DEVDAS, I got your letter.
('59', 247, 7, 17, 437137) Write to me when you get time and let me know your reasons for thinking that the reforms suggested by you in Hindi are possible.
('59', 247, 7, 18, 437266) There is Dr. Sharma’s Sun ray Hospital in Karol Bagh.
('59', 247, 7, 19, 437320) Amtussalaam has been admitted there.
('59', 247, 7, 20, 437357) She has great faith in Dr. Sharma.
('59', 247, 7, 21, 437392) Find some time and get acquainted with him, and learn from him whatever appeals to you.
('59', 247, 7, 22, 437480) Give me some details about the hospital.
('59', 247, 7, 23, 437521) See Amtussalaam and inquire after her health.
('59', 247, 7, 24, 437567) I hope you remember about the small Urdu dictionary.
('59', 247, 7, 25, 437620) I will remember what you have written about Rajaji.
('59', 247, 7, 26, 437672) Do not be lazy in writing to me.
('59', 247, 7, 27, 437705) Send me Rajaji’s and your comments on Harijan.
('59', 247, 7, 28, 437752) Request him to write to me a few lines.
('59', 247, 8, 29, 437792) From a photostat of the Gujarati: G.N. 1993
('59', 247, 9, 30, 437836) 1 Amtussalaam had told the addressee that Gandhiji, being worried about the correctness of the nature cure treatment followed for the Ashram inmates, wanted him to go to the Ashram and stay there for some time.
('59', 247, 9, 31, 438047) The addressee had therefore written to Gandhiji that after disposing of the work in hand he would immediately go to the Ashram.
('59', 247, 9, 32, 438175) 2 From the postmark and the reference to Harijan; the source has “12 1 33”, which is evidently a slip.

('59', 248, 3, 4, 438371) CHI RAMA, How is this?
('59', 248, 3, 5, 438394) After taking a vow to write to me every week, you broke it the very next week.
('59', 248, 3, 6, 438473) But please remember I will not leave you.
('59', 248, 3, 7, 438515) One may not give one’s word, but having given it one should keep it even at the cost of one’s life.

('59', 248, 7, 10, 438693) February 12, 1933
('59', 248, 8, 11, 438711) SHIVABHAI, I did not find your letter incomplete in any respect.
('59', 248, 8, 12, 438776) I hope you got my previous letter.
('59', 248, 8, 13, 438811) An act of expiation for violation of a vow should be directly related to the nature of the vow.
('59', 248, 8, 14, 438907) If one has been guilty of telling a lie, the proper expiation for it should be observance of silence for some time and not a resolution to give up drinking, for the latter is desirable even in itself.
('59', 248, 8, 15, 439108) If drinking was the cause of one’s speaking, untruth, then of course it would be one’s duty to give it up.
('59', 248, 8, 16, 439215) Similarly, if you touched your wife’s body with impure thoughts, you should stop going to her room or even refrain from the sight of your wife for some days.
('59', 248, 8, 17, 439373) In addition to doing this, you may give up eating sweets as reminder to yourself of your resolution.
('59', 248, 8, 18, 439474) However, you are fully awake and conscious of your lapses.
('59', 248, 8, 19, 439533) You will, therefore, be saved.

('59', 249, 2, 3, 439686) February 12, 1933
('59', 249, 3, 4, 439704) RAMBHAU, This time you have signed your letter in Bengali.
('59', 249, 3, 5, 439763) If you have done all this with a proper plan, it is certainly good.
('59', 249, 3, 6, 439831) It should not be a matter for wonder that a young man should try to learn Sanskrit, Bengali, Urdu, Tamil, Punjabi, Sindhi, Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Oriya, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and English, for of all these the really independent languages are only three, English, Sanskrit and Tamil.
('59', 249, 3, 7, 440122) The other languages are the daughters either of Sanskrit or Tamil.
('59', 249, 3, 8, 440189) But you will be able to learn them only if you are really interested in them.

('59', 249, 7, 11, 440366) February 12, 1933
('59', 249, 8, 12, 440384) KAKA, I got your letter.
('59', 249, 8, 13, 440409) If we have trouble when we cut teeth, why should we not have it also when we lose them?
('59', 249, 8, 14, 440497) Do you get pure milk?
('59', 249, 8, 15, 440519) Though your experience is that a milk diet brings on weakness and causes diarrhoea, I still think that the experiment is worth making.
('59', 249, 8, 16, 440654) Cereal foods should not be necessary for one to be able to digest milk.
('59', 249, 8, 17, 440726) The fact that you require them indicates some weakness in the system.
('59', 249, 8, 18, 440796) I cling to my belief that one can eat wheat only when one is able to digest milk and fruits.
('59', 249, 8, 19, 440889) Some people believe that solid food helps in the digestion of milk.
('59', 249, 8, 20, 440957) But in fact it is not digested, and is retained in the body in some harmful form which gives one the illusion of strength.
('59', 249, 8, 21, 441080) If you get pure and fresh milk, it is worth while trying the experiment of drinking it without heating it.
('59', 249, 8, 22, 441187) These days I drink such milk.
('59', 249, 8, 23, 441217) It has done no harm so far, though I have not carried on the experiment long enough to say that it has benefited me.
('59', 249, 8, 24, 441334) I started it about fifteen days ago.
('59', 249, 8, 25, 441371) You should get your knees massaged.
('59', 249, 8, 26, 441407) You cannot afford to be an old man so soon.

('59', 250, 1, 5, 441712) I am expecting a big telescope on Monday.

('59', 250, 7, 14, 442099) You did a very good thing in fasting as a remedy for your fever.
('59', 250, 7, 15, 442164) An innocuous egg is one from which no chick can come out.
('59', 250, 7, 16, 442222) Personally I regard such eggs as acceptable food.
('59', 250, 7, 17, 442272) From a medical point of view, they are beneficial in a variety of conditions.
('59', 250, 7, 18, 442350) They are likely to be harmful in regard to brahmacharya, but not to persons of weak health.
('59', 250, 7, 19, 442442) There are two considerations which can be urged against such eggs.
('59', 250, 7, 20, 442509) From a religious point of view, they are an unnecessary addition to the number of articles which we eat, and from the point of view of vegetarianism they are as objectionable as milk.
('59', 250, 7, 21, 442693) Probably it gives a hen greater pain to carry such eggs and be caged for their sake than it does a cow to be milked.
('59', 250, 7, 22, 442810) However, such eggs are not in the same category as meat, which we regard as forbidden.
('59', 250, 7, 23, 442897) It may be necessary in some cases to recommend innocuous eggs as medicine.
('59', 250, 7, 24, 442972) This fully sums up my view on this subject.
('59', 250, 7, 25, 443016) Keep a diary and do not neglect to spin for yajna.

('59', 251, 3, 8, 443482) If he does not come, it may be necessary for you to go there.
('59', 251, 3, 9, 443544) You should not worry about my fast.
('59', 251, 3, 10, 443580) I am ascertaining the facts.
('59', 251, 3, 11, 443609) I will not take a single step without careful thought, though I may not be able to convince you and others every time.
('59', 251, 3, 12, 443728) Let me always remain true to myself.
('59', 251, 3, 13, 443765) On the day on which I am false to myself, you may be sure that I will have fallen.
('59', 251, 3, 14, 443848) “Being false to myself” means not doing what I think to be right.
('59', 251, 3, 15, 443914) Yes, the heat which is being given to me is diathermy, but it has not benefited me at all.
('59', 251, 3, 16, 444005) The Chief Surgeon here says that the trouble is a symptom of old age.

('59', 253, 7, 11, 446292) DEAR DAUGHTER AMTUSSALAAM, I have your letters.
('59', 253, 7, 12, 446340) You did right in going straight to Delhi.
('59', 253, 7, 13, 446382) Now you must remain there until you recover fully.
('59', 253, 7, 14, 446433) You should come to see me on your recovery before you go to the Ashram.
('59', 253, 7, 15, 446505) That Dr. Sharma is preparing to go to the Ashram is comforting news to me.
('59', 253, 7, 16, 446580) You can write to me whenever you wish.
('59', 253, 7, 17, 446619) It will cause me no discomfort to write to you, but your not writing will certainly grieve me.

('59', 253, 13, 24, 446899) MY DEAR C. R., I have read your and G.’s 1 appeal to the public.
('59', 253, 13, 25, 446964) Why do you even so much as mention the fast and its possibility?
('59', 253, 13, 26, 447029) You surely undermine its spiritual value, if the fast, if it at all comes, is to be a spiritual fast.
('59', 253, 13, 27, 447131) I do not even know that the fast is a certainty if the Bills do not pass during this session or at all.
('59', 253, 13, 28, 447235) I think that you should all dismiss it from your consideration altogether and let the public mind work unfettered by it.
('59', 253, 13, 29, 447356) When it does come it will produce its own effect

('59', 254, 1, 2, 447471) if it is a spiritual act.
('59', 254, 1, 3, 447497) If it is the product of a diseased or arrogant mind, it will merely torture the body and excite pity or contempt according to the temperament of the people who may hear of it.
('59', 254, 1, 4, 447673) Do take this advice as from an expert and act up to it to the fullest extent.
('59', 254, 1, 5, 447751) Then you have seriously to consider Pt. Malaviyaji’s attitude.
('59', 254, 2, 6, 447814) He is strongly against the Bills especially if they are not to be circulated.
('59', 254, 2, 7, 447892) Of course I do not share the view.
('59', 254, 2, 8, 447927) I shall be writing to him.
('59', 254, 2, 9, 447954) But you should see him if you can at all spare yourself or send Devdas alone.
('59', 254, 2, 10, 448032) But on this I have no firm opinion.
('59', 254, 2, 11, 448068) You will do what appeals to you most.
('59', 254, 2, 12, 448106) You know the outside atmosphere firsthand.
('59', 254, 2, 13, 448149) All my knowledge is secondhand and therefore worthless.
('59', 254, 2, 14, 448205) I had what must be described in one way as a very unsatisfactory interview with Dr. A. 2 He is irreconcilable.
('59', 254, 2, 15, 448316) In another way it was satisfactory.
('59', 254, 2, 16, 448352) I know him better than I did.

('59', 255, 2, 3, 449450) February 13, 1933
('59', 255, 3, 4, 449468) PREMA, It is the morning of the silence day.
('59', 255, 3, 5, 449513) I got up at three and have taken up your letter to reply to it.
('59', 255, 3, 6, 449577) I liked it very much indeed.
('59', 255, 3, 7, 449606) You have given me in it all that I wanted.
('59', 255, 3, 8, 449649) It fully answers to my imagination of what women can give me.
('59', 255, 3, 9, 449711) What it gives seems small and unspectacular, but is very useful to a seeker after truth.
('59', 255, 3, 10, 449800) I learn something from an objective letter like this one, and it helps me to guide you and others.
('59', 255, 3, 11, 449899) The Ashram is indeed a dharmashala.
('59', 255, 3, 12, 449935) But the word has two meanings.
('59', 255, 3, 13, 449966) It means a place where people can stay free, but it also means a place where one can learn dharma and try to follow it.
('59', 255, 3, 14, 450086) The Ashram is a dharmashala in this second sense of the word.
('59', 255, 3, 15, 450148) But dharma means truth.
('59', 255, 3, 16, 450172) The Ashram, therefore, is a place where one may know the truth and try to follow it, that is, show agraha 1 for it, and hence it is Satyagraha Ashram.
('59', 255, 3, 17, 450323) In our quest for truth, we wish to cultivate unity with all living creatures.
('59', 255, 3, 18, 450401) The Ashram, therefore, is an ever growing family.
('59', 255, 3, 19, 450451) But it is something more even than that, for it is the means and dharma is the end, and not vice versa.
('59', 255, 3, 20, 450555) It is also a big school, and yet it is not so; for, since it is a family, we cannot mechanically apply there rules of outward behaviour such as are followed for other types of training.
('59', 255, 3, 21, 450741) The letter of the rule has to be sacrificed in order to save the spirit of the rule.
('59', 255, 3, 22, 450826) I will now apply these observations to some specific cases.
('59', 255, 3, 23, 450886) In bringing up and educating Lakshmi, we, including you, are being tested.
('59', 255, 3, 24, 450961) What would we do to children in our own family?
('59', 255, 3, 25, 451009) What would you do to your own sister?
('59', 255, 3, 26, 451047) If Lakshmi does not observe the rules, the fault is chiefly mine, and then yours.
('59', 255, 3, 27, 451129) I leave out the others.
('59', 255, 3, 28, 451153) I leave out Narandas, too, for if we hold him responsible for the behaviour of every person in the Ashram, he will not be able to attend to his own duties.
('59', 255, 3, 29, 451309) Looking after Lakshmi is a woman’s job, and particularly of the woman to whom it is entrusted.
('59', 255, 3, 30, 451404) The fault is chiefly mine because I am her adopted father and also mother.
('59', 255, 3, 31, 451479) I did my duty as a father but

('59', 256, 1, 2, 451565) not as a mother, because I remained away from the Ashram most of the time.
('59', 256, 1, 3, 451640) I feel now that I should not have accepted Lakshmi at all.
('59', 256, 1, 4, 451699) But who was I to decide?
('59', 256, 1, 5, 451724) I am but a servant of God.
('59', 256, 1, 6, 451751) I did not seek Lakshmi.
('59', 256, 1, 7, 451775) God sent her.
('59', 256, 1, 8, 451789) Let Him, then, look after her.
('59', 256, 1, 9, 451820) She was under the charge of Ba first, then of Santok, then of Gangabehn, and now she is under your charge.
('59', 256, 1, 10, 451927) None of you asked to have charge of her.
('59', 256, 1, 11, 451968) It was time and circumstances which put her under the charge of these persons one after another.
('59', 256, 1, 12, 452065) You should now do the best that you can.
('59', 256, 1, 13, 452106) Whenever necessary, you may consult me.
('59', 256, 1, 14, 452146) Do not get tired of your charge or despair.
('59', 256, 1, 15, 452190) Have faith and bathe her with your love.
('59', 256, 1, 16, 452231) God will ultimately solve the problem.
('59', 256, 1, 17, 452270) She has come to us as a representative of Harijans to claim payment of the debt which we owe to them.
('59', 256, 1, 18, 452372) If she is full of shortcomings and is indolent, the responsibility for that lies on you, me and on the caste Hindus.
('59', 256, 1, 19, 452489) We reap as we sow.
('59', 256, 1, 20, 452508) I am trying to get her married off.
('59', 256, 1, 21, 452544) I have written to Lakshmidas and inquired about Maruti.
('59', 256, 1, 22, 452600) I have also written to Dudabhai.
('59', 256, 1, 23, 452633) You need not get upset because more boys and girls are coming to the Ashram.
('59', 256, 1, 24, 452710) They will benefit to the extent that they observe the rules.
('59', 256, 1, 25, 452771) We may let them stay as long as we tolerate their laxity, and ask them to leave when we can do so no longer.
('59', 256, 1, 26, 452880) People do not stay in a dharmashala permanently.
('59', 256, 1, 27, 452929) Even near relations do not stay permanently.
('59', 256, 1, 28, 452974) Those of them who can accommodate themselves to the discipline of the Ashram will stay, and the others will leave.
('59', 256, 1, 29, 453089) Why should we care either way?
('59', 256, 1, 30, 453120) Moreover, we cannot adopt any other policy in the present circumstances.
('59', 256, 1, 31, 453193) As long as we can do so, we should admit people who come unasked and who seem deserving.
('59', 256, 1, 32, 453282) Most of them will leave on their own.
('59', 256, 1, 33, 453320) Our rules themselves will drive them away.
('59', 256, 1, 34, 453363) Everybody who comes must do physical work.
('59', 256, 1, 35, 453406) They should clean lavatories and eat simple food in the same manner as we swallow medicine.
('59', 256, 1, 36, 453498) They will not get jaggery, nor wheat as often as they might wish.
('59', 256, 1, 37, 453564) If we can daily demonstrate more and more clearly by our manner of life that the Ashram is a representative of the starving poor, we shall always be safe and happy.
('59', 256, 1, 38, 453729) This means that there should be increasing simplicity in our life in the Ashram and the rules should be observed more and more strictly.
('59', 256, 1, 39, 453866) If fire preserves its nature, creatures which cannot endure it simply cannot live near it.
('59', 256, 1, 40, 453957) That is the virtue of fire and not its defect.
('59', 256, 1, 41, 454004) It is because, unlike fire, we are not true to ourselves that all the problems arise.
('59', 256, 1, 42, 454090) My suggestion about simplicity and strictness in observing the rules concerns ourselves.
('59', 256, 1, 43, 454179) We should cultivate them in ever greater degree.
('59', 256, 1, 44, 454228) We seek
('59', 257, 0, 1, 454236) 258 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 257, 1, 2, 454278) ,protection for ourselves in our inner selves and not outside of us “we” here means all of us who voluntarily stay in the Ashram, you, I and everybody else.
('59', 257, 1, 3, 454435) And one should not observe only as many rules as the other inmates do.
('59', 257, 1, 4, 454506) One must observe every rule as strictly as one can.
('59', 257, 1, 5, 454558) In this lies the secret of the progress of the Ashram.
('59', 257, 1, 6, 454613) The rule should be, a liberal attitude towards others and strictness towards oneself.
('59', 257, 1, 7, 454699) Even so, we shall preserve some minimum decency in our attitude to ourselves, for very often our liberal attitude towards others will not be sincere and our strictness towards ourselves will be so only in appearance.
('59', 257, 1, 8, 454916) The ideal for girls is a life of inviolate brahmacharya.
('59', 257, 1, 9, 454973) Training for it includes training for ideal married life.
('59', 257, 1, 10, 455031) Boys and girls do not require to be instructed as to what married life means.
('59', 257, 1, 11, 455109) That relation is a part of the animal nature of men and women.
('59', 257, 1, 12, 455172) The institution of marriage was devised as a means of exercising some control on that nature.
('59', 257, 1, 13, 455266) Its perfect control means brahmacharya.
('59', 257, 1, 14, 455306) Anybody who can observe this perfect control will also be able to observe the limited control of marriage.
('59', 257, 1, 15, 455413) But those who regard marriage itself as their ideal will not understand the real purpose even of marriage.
('59', 257, 1, 16, 455520) What training does one require for lust?
('59', 257, 1, 17, 455561) It will grow of itself.
('59', 257, 1, 18, 455585) However, the girl who has accepted complete brahmacharya as her ideal must learn how to manage a home.
('59', 257, 1, 19, 455688) She must learn something about child care.
('59', 257, 1, 20, 455731) She will not be a nun living in a cave.
('59', 257, 1, 21, 455771) An unmarried woman marries the whole world, makes herself a mother and a daughter to all people and thereby becomes fit to manage the affairs of the whole society.
('59', 257, 1, 22, 455935) May be there has been no such unmarried woman.
('59', 257, 1, 23, 455982) Nevertheless that is the ideal.
('59', 257, 1, 24, 456014) For all girls, therefore, the training should be the same.
('59', 257, 1, 25, 456073) I think I have explained the idea clearly.
('59', 257, 1, 26, 456116) If I have not done so, ask me to explain it again.
('59', 257, 1, 27, 456167) This will explain your duty towards that Muslim woman.
('59', 257, 1, 28, 456222) The real cause of fainting fits and similar ailments in girls lies in our own shortcomings.
('59', 257, 1, 29, 456314) If we have made fairly satisfactory progress, even the presence of young people among us will not be dangerous to the Ashram.
('59', 257, 1, 30, 456440) But whenever we see such danger, we should ask the young man or woman to leave.
('59', 257, 1, 31, 456520) If you wish to stop admitting other young men or women, you may do so.
('59', 257, 1, 32, 456591) All my hopes rest on Narandas.
('59', 257, 1, 33, 456622) If Narandas who is the secretary of the Ashram is the Narandas as I imagine him to be, everything will be well.
('59', 257, 1, 34, 456734) My faith in him is daily increasing.
('59', 257, 1, 35, 456771) If he is defeated, some

('59', 258, 1, 2, 456840) other old inmate of the Ashram will grow and advance, and I am sure, therefore, that everything will be well.
('59', 258, 1, 3, 456950) There are many residents in the Ashram but only a few inmates.
('59', 258, 1, 4, 457013) That is why we do not get sufficient workers.
('59', 258, 1, 5, 457059) In these very imperfect conditions, all of you should do the best that you can.
('59', 258, 1, 6, 457139) The Ashram is the measuring rod by which people can judge me.
('59', 258, 1, 7, 457201) I take it with me wherever I go.
('59', 258, 1, 8, 457234) Wherever my body may be, my soul is always in the Ashram.
('59', 258, 1, 9, 457292) All the shortcomings found in the Ashram must be present, visibly or invisibly, in me too.
('59', 258, 1, 10, 457383) If I have made a mistake in understanding you all, the blame must be mine and nobody else’s.
('59', 258, 1, 11, 457476) If, however, I do not know myself, how can I sit in judgment over all of you?
('59', 258, 1, 12, 457554) When I think of particular persons, I see that I did not invite anybody except Chhaganlal and Maganlal.
('59', 258, 1, 13, 457658) All the others were sent to me by God to test me or to help me.
('59', 258, 1, 14, 457722) And now another matter.
('59', 258, 1, 15, 457746) You made a mistake in not going to Dr. Patel yourself.
('59', 258, 1, 16, 457801) You cannot ask a doctor’s advice through a note.
('59', 258, 1, 17, 457850) Observe complete silence.

('59', 258, 4, 21, 458019) 365. LETTER TO HINDU CENTRAL COMMITTEE
('59', 258, 5, 22, 458058) February 13, 1933
('59', 258, 6, 23, 458076) DEAR FRIENDS, 1. In continuation of my letter acknowledging yours of 4th instant I have now to say that I have read the statement of the Hindu Central Committee with much attention and when after reading the statement I saw the names of distinguished lawyers amongst other notabilities as the original members of the Committee I was filled with sorrow.
('59', 258, 6, 24, 458429) 2. Take this assertion in the statement:
('59', 258, 7, 25, 458470) We feel that there is no question of inferiority complex in the divi 
('59', 258, 8, 26, 458540) sions of Hindu society and least of all, no sin has been committed all these
('59', 258, 9, 27, 458617) centuries by the orthodox Hindus who have been following the traditions
('59', 258, 10, 28, 458689) established by all the merciful humanitarian sages of this land.
('59', 258, 10, 29, 458754) Is this assertion borne out by the evidence of the senses?
('59', 258, 10, 30, 458813) If the Committee were to contend that there is in the Hindu Shastras no
('59', 259, 0, 1, 458885) 260 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 259, 1, 2, 458927) inferiority or superiority I should at once agree.
('59', 259, 1, 3, 458978) But untouchability as it is practised today with the attendant system of locations and deprivation practically of all the amenities of life for the so called untouchables is surely proof of their inferiority.
('59', 259, 1, 4, 459187) These disabilities have been often enumerated in the public Press.
('59', 259, 1, 5, 459254) The precept of equality therefore seems to have been systematically and cruelly disregarded by modern Hindu society.
('59', 259, 1, 6, 459371) Is the Committee able to point out any act on the part of what it calls the orthodox Hindus for the amelioration of the economic and material condition of the depressed classes?
('59', 259, 1, 7, 459549) And is not the very existence of a class called “depressed” sufficient contradiction of the above quoted assertion?
('59', 259, 1, 8, 459665) 3. The Committee then proceeds and says:
('59', 259, 2, 9, 459706) There are also in many places in the country large sections of the population amongst caste Hindus who are worse than Panchamas both
('59', 259, 3, 10, 459839) economically and culturally.
('59', 259, 3, 11, 459868) I am unaware of any sections of caste Hindus who are both economically and culturally worse than Panchamas, and if there are I should very much like to know their names.
('59', 259, 3, 12, 460038) 4. The third statement of the Committee to which I would invite attention is:
('59', 259, 4, 13, 460116) It will be a travesty of truth to suggest that the orthodox Hindus have not been generous in their dealings with the Panchamas or Harijans in the
('59', 259, 5, 14, 460262) villages.
('59', 259, 5, 15, 460272) Is it a sign of generosity on the part of caste Hindus to give leavings of their dishes to Harijans, to force their labour against a starvation wage, to deny to them the services of physicians, schoolmasters, barbers and practically all the other services to which they, the caste Hindus, are used?
('59', 259, 5, 16, 460571) 5. Another statement of the Committee is:
('59', 259, 6, 17, 460613) Except in the higher classes today, there is no unemployment problem in the country.
('59', 259, 6, 18, 460698) Surely, this is a sweeping statement at complete variance with known facts as found in historical and Government records.
('59', 259, 6, 19, 460820) 6. The Committee then proceeds:
('59', 259, 7, 20, 460852) The first creed of the orthodox Hindu is always the gift of food to the hungry and he has always felt it as a religious duty and his first prayer has been to the Lord to vouchsafe happiness to all human beings.
('59', 259, 7, 21, 461063) The creed is undoubtedly there.
('59', 259, 7, 22, 461095) Has the Committee any
('59', 260, 0, 1, 461117) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 261
('59', 260, 1, 2, 461162) evidence to show any corresponding action on the part of the orthodox Hindus in connection with Harijans?
('59', 260, 1, 3, 461268) 7. Then the Committee goes on to say:
('59', 260, 2, 4, 461306) It cannot be suggested for one moment that though the Congress has thrown itself whole heartedly in favour of this agitation for the removal of untouchability and for temple entry after the announcement of the fast of Mr. Gandhi, it has done any appreciable service for the economic and material uplift of the depressed classes.
('59', 260, 2, 5, 461635) The Committee should know that it is not possible for the Congress “to throw itself whole heartedly into the agitation”.
('59', 260, 2, 6, 461756) It is being carried on by the general Hindu population organized by the recently formed Servants of Untouchables Society.
('59', 260, 2, 7, 461878) That Society invites all without distinction of party to help it to remove untouchability.
('59', 260, 2, 8, 461969) This Society has planned a wide constructive programme.
('59', 260, 2, 9, 462025) In so far as the Congress itself is concerned, its Hindu members have a record for the service of Harijans which is second to that of no other similar organization.
('59', 260, 2, 10, 462190) 8. But the Committee goes on:
('59', 260, 3, 11, 462220) If the call to join the movement for such uplift comes from persons who are pledged to temple entry, the orthodox Hindus on their part cannot but view it with suspicion, especially when it is preceded by Gandhi’s cry of “Leave the temple entry to me”.
('59', 260, 3, 12, 462472) I fail to see why the orthodox Hindus should view with suspicion the call for joining the movement for uplift because it comes from persons who are openly advocating temple entry, not by compulsion but by conversion.
('59', 260, 3, 13, 462689) And what can be the meaning of emphasis on my statement “Leave the temple entry to me”?
('59', 260, 3, 14, 462777) I am charitable enough to assume that the Committee framed that sentence without knowing the context in which ‘‘Leave the temple entry to me” was first used.
('59', 260, 3, 15, 462935) It was said in answer to correspondents who were impatient to offer satyagraha and adopt energetic measures for opening other temples.
('59', 260, 3, 16, 463070) In order to keep the movement within fixed limits and in order to confine direct action by way of fast for the present at least to Sjt.
('59', 260, 3, 17, 463206) Kelappan and myself I said to the correspondents, “Leave the temple entry to me and go on with the other constructive programme of economic and educational uplift”.
('59', 260, 3, 18, 463371) The Committee can easily verify this from my writings.
('59', 260, 3, 19, 463426) I hope therefore that the Committee will disabuse their minds of the prejudice betrayed against me in the sentence quoted.
('59', 261, 0, 1, 463549) 262 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 261, 1, 2, 463591) 9. The next sentence in the Committee’s statement runs:
('59', 261, 2, 3, 463647) If Mr. Gandhi and his followers will give an undertaking to save temples and other religious institutions from interference by the mixed legislatures of the land, we are willing to whole heartedly co operate with them.
('59', 261, 2, 4, 463866) I have shown repeatedly that the two Bills before the Legislative Assembly imply no interference with temples or other religious institutions.
('59', 261, 2, 5, 464009) They seek to restore the status quo existing before certain decisions of law courts, well known to the legal members of the Committee.
('59', 261, 2, 6, 464144) I can give the assurance on my behalf and on behalf of my co workers that we have no desire whatsoever to invoke interference by the legislatures in matters of religion and if only the Committee will co operate in the prosecution of the general movement for the removal of untouchability, not of the desirable type such as is mentioned in the Shastras in the interests of sanitation, but of the—in my opinion—undesirable type as is being practised today, the Committee will soon discover that there is no cause whatsoever for alarm or suspicion and that if there is anything in the two Bills that can be shown to be an interference with religious liberty, the defect can undoubtedly be remedied without difficulty.
('59', 261, 2, 7, 464859) 10. With the sentiment expressed in the last two sentences of the statement of the Committee I can whole heartedly agree, for so far as I am concerned there is no desire indiscriminately “to import Western ideals of society, civilization and equality”.
('59', 261, 2, 8, 465112) Perhaps, no one has written, and endeavoured as much as possible to act in accordance with the writing, against Western civilization and I have not the slightest desire to destroy the foundations of Hindu caste system, if by that is meant varnashramadharma.
('59', 261, 2, 9, 465370) The movement against untoucha bility is on that very account deliberately circumscribed and restricted to the very things described by the Committee except temple entry, and as to this last, it can be shown conclusively that there is no desire whatsoever to force temple entry but by proper disciplined agitation to bring about a change in Hindu public opinion, a change not inconsistent with the spirit of the Shastras.
('59', 261, 2, 10, 465791) 11. If the Committee will dispassionately read my analysis of the statement, I am not without hope that it will see that whoever has framed the statement has committed the members of the Committee to assertions which cannot be supported by existing facts.
('59', 261, 2, 11, 466047) The statement though sent to me is merely a copy of what has already been sent to
('59', 262, 0, 1, 466129) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 263
('59', 262, 1, 2, 466174) the Press, but on reading the statement I discovered that according to the Committee’s admissions there was a great deal that was common between the Committee and the reformers and that the assertions which were made in order to emphasize differences were mostly if not wholly imaginary and not capable of proof.
('59', 262, 1, 3, 466487) I felt that I would point out to the Committee in a private communication the glaring flaws in the statement and see if there was not any possibility of meeting on a common platform.
('59', 262, 1, 4, 466670) 12. If the Committee however considers that all the assertions made in the statement can be supported and that I am labouring under self delusion, I would be glad to be corrected.
('59', 262, 1, 5, 466850) If the Committee sees any good in my letter, I invite it to send one or more representatives to confer with me with a view to exploring possibilities of common action or at least of understanding the real differences in matters of principle.
('59', 262, 1, 6, 467092) Pending your reply, I am not sending this letter to the Press, but if the Committee finds it to be hopeless, it is at liberty to publish it.
('59', 262, 2, 7, 467233) Yours sincerely, THE HON.

('59', 264, 6, 9, 469739) Asked if permission was given to Appasaheb as a special case, Mr. Gandhi declined to answer.
('59', 264, 6, 10, 469832) But it is learnt that the new orders of the Government of India, while permitting high caste Hindus to do voluntary conservancy work, leave it entirely to the discretion of the Jail Superintendent to permit or not to permit a particular prisoner to do this.
('59', 264, 6, 11, 470090) Asked why he attached such importance to this subject, Mr. Gandhi replied that untouchability had to go everywhere, and more so in jails.
('59', 264, 6, 12, 470228) Untouchability could not exist in jails where prisoners could not insist on high class and low class distinctions, and where they must be willing to perform all services, including those imposed on the so called low castes.
('59', 264, 6, 13, 470452) Asked if he would advise high castes outside also to do conservancy work, Mr. Gandhi replied: I would most decidedly expect high caste men to render voluntarily all useful services which today are reserved to certain classes.
('59', 264, 6, 14, 470678) The idea that the most necessary service in the world will be considered degrading or should carry any sin with it is abhorrent to me.
('59', 264, 6, 15, 470813) Our villages will wear a different appearance altogether when sanitary services begin to be classed among the honourable occupations, nor will the streets of our cities be so dangerously dirty as they are today, when we have ceased to consider it degrading to take a brush, bucket and broom in order to do the necessary cleansing.

('59', 265, 14, 19, 471956) MY DEAR SHRIPRAKASH, Though doleful, the receipt of your letter was a matter of joy for me.
('59', 265, 14, 20, 472048) I have no doubt whatsoever that in the quiet of the village surroundings you will soon recover your lost health and repair your broken spirits.
('59', 265, 14, 21, 472192) You are not an old man but being a man of emotion and possessing a sensitive nature, you imagine all sorts of evil.
('59', 265, 14, 22, 472308) You have many years of active.
('59', 265, 14, 23, 472339) life and service in front of you.
('59', 265, 14, 24, 472373) Many people have gone through much more distress of the body than you have and yet I see them today in possession of sound health and bright spirits.
('59', 265, 14, 25, 472523) Mens sana in corpore sano you learnt in your youth and as soon as the body becomes healthy, the mind is bound to react.
('59', 265, 14, 26, 472643) Meanwhile therefore your first and the last care is to regain your health and not to worry about the future of the family, the country or the world.
('59', 265, 14, 27, 472792) You cannot be the architect of any of these but you can contribute your own share to the advancement of all the three.
('59', 265, 14, 28, 472911) In a true scheme of life the real advancement of one conduces to the advancement of all.
('59', 265, 14, 29, 473000) You may not write anything of your experiences of the events

('59', 266, 1, 2, 473188) happening around you.
('59', 266, 1, 3, 473210) That must be a sealed book to me except what I can gather through the papers that I am permitted to receive; nor, constituted as I am by nature, have I the slightest desire to know them.
('59', 266, 1, 4, 473397) A prisoner is civilly dead to the outside world, and that is right.
('59', 266, 1, 5, 473465) If he hankers after peeping into the forbidden land he is like the departed ghost which according to our belief misbehaves itself if it hankers after establishing communication with the world he was made by the Angel of Death to leave.
('59', 266, 1, 6, 473701) A prisoner who misbehaves like the ghost fails to establish real communication with the world he has left and in the vain pursuit loses the pleasure, such as it may be, which falls to the lot even of the prisoner.
('59', 266, 1, 7, 473915) Realizing this beautiful truth I have never misbehaved like the ghost.
('59', 266, 1, 8, 473986) I shall remember what you say about the spelling of your name.
('59', 266, 1, 9, 474049) 1 It was Father who gave me the idea that you were a stickler for the right spelling of your name.
('59', 266, 1, 10, 474148) You have now repaid him in his own coin and retort that he is a stickler, not you.
('59', 266, 1, 11, 474231) I have thrown the apple of discord between father and son.
('59', 266, 1, 12, 474290) You will now fight it out amongst yourselves.
('59', 266, 1, 13, 474336) I do not mind because I am out of harm’s way, and since I have your permission I shall continue to spell your name after my own fashion.
('59', 266, 1, 14, 474473) But if I am not concerned about your health I am much concerned about Shivaprasad’s.
('59', 266, 1, 15, 474558) I now understand why he is silent after having promised that he would send me weekly report about his health.
('59', 266, 1, 16, 474668) I am deeply distressed.
('59', 266, 1, 17, 474692) I will write to him, but in any case you will continue to give me such news as you may receive, and though you may not give me the news of the outside world you must continue to write to me about your own progress.
('59', 266, 1, 18, 474907) Remember me to the children and give them the love of us all and accept the same for yourself.

('59', 267, 2, 3, 475196) February 14, 1933
('59', 267, 3, 4, 475214) MY DEAR RAJBHOJ, I have your letter.
('59', 267, 3, 5, 475251) I see that you are in a hurry.
('59', 267, 3, 6, 475282) I have thought over your scheme and I have conferred with Sheth Jamnalalji also.
('59', 267, 3, 7, 475363) I think that at the present moment you should concentrate your attention upon your Hostel.
('59', 267, 3, 8, 475454) That will certainly absorb much of your time if you are to make it an ideal home for students and then you will want some leisure from that routine work for public engagements.
('59', 267, 3, 9, 475631) If you took up the responsibility of conducting an Ashram you will have to devote yourself entirely to it and then possess qualifications which you might not have today.
('59', 267, 3, 10, 475801) In any case, seeing that you have that high ambition, I would like you, when you can spare yourself, to pass at least three months at the Ashram and try to live the Ashram life.
('59', 267, 3, 11, 475979) That will certainly be of use to you in every one of your activities.
('59', 267, 3, 12, 476049) I am quite sure that you should give up the idea of reviving Dalit Bandhoo.
('59', 267, 3, 13, 476125) As to the Marathi edition of Harijan, I am considering the thing myself.
('59', 267, 3, 14, 476198) You have seen how it is a rule with me not to issue any paper that does not become self supporting.
('59', 267, 3, 15, 476298) It is to me a test of its being wanted by the public.
('59', 267, 3, 16, 476352) It is only in rare cases that a paper may be issued in the first instance at a loss.
('59', 267, 4, 17, 476437) Yours sincerely,

('59', 268, 13, 19, 477213) DEAR MR. JAYAKAR, I thank you very much indeed for sending me a prompt reply, and I am glad that you have written to the Viceroy 2. I have no doubt that it will have its weight.
('59', 268, 13, 20, 477391) I thank you also for two copies of the Bill

('59', 269, 1, 3, 477909) I shall very probably make use of it for the ensuing number of Harijan.
('59', 269, 1, 4, 477981) 1 I hope you got a copy of the first issue.
('59', 269, 1, 5, 478025) If you had the time to go through it, I would value your criticism and your opinion for publication on the interpretation of the Shastras on untouchability.
('59', 269, 1, 6, 478182) As that of a Sanskrit scholar and jurist your opinion will have great value if you can at all find time to give it.

('59', 270, 2, 3, 478806) February 14, 1933
('59', 270, 3, 4, 478824) MY DEAR GHANSHYAMDAS, I have your letter.
('59', 270, 3, 5, 478866) 1 I understand the situation.
('59', 270, 3, 6, 478896) We can but do whatever is possible and await the result.
('59', 270, 3, 7, 478953) It is beyond the control of man.
('59', 270, 3, 8, 478986) I have a long letter from Malaviyaji in which he opposes the introduction of the Bills altogether and in any case insists upon their circulation.
('59', 270, 3, 9, 479132) I am suggesting to him that he should come over here and discuss the whole thing with me before coming to a conclusion.
('59', 270, 3, 10, 479252) I have suggested to Rajaji 2 that he should go to him or send Devdas.
('59', 270, 3, 11, 479322) I do not know whether it is worth while your going.
('59', 270, 3, 12, 479374) I leave the thing to you.
('59', 270, 3, 13, 479400) About Bengal, I hope you saw my letter 3 to Ramanand Baboo.
('59', 270, 3, 14, 479460) And now Dr. Ambedkar appears on the scene, I have written to Rajaji and also telegraphed 4 him as to what I feel about exploiting the possibility of my fast.
('59', 270, 3, 15, 479618) I think that it should not be done.
('59', 270, 3, 16, 479654) The fast must be dismissed out of consideration altogether.
('59', 270, 3, 17, 479714) This exploiting robs it of any spiritual value it might possess.
('59', 270, 3, 18, 479779) The knowledge that it is a possibility may colour your action but you may not use it to affect the actions of others.
('59', 270, 3, 19, 479897) That would amount to illegitimate pressure.
('59', 270, 3, 20, 479941) I wish you will not henceforth mention it anywhere.

('59', 270, 6, 24, 480216) If the Government obstruct, then of course the Bill may not be introduced even in this session.
('59', 270, 6, 25, 480312) But from what I see, I hope hey will at least help the introduction of the Bill in this session, but they would not be prepared to go beyond that.
('59', 270, 6, 26, 480459) They would insist on the Bill being circulated.

('59', 271, 3, 4, 480764) I got your postcard.
('59', 271, 3, 5, 480785) You had said in it that you would write a long letter.
('59', 271, 3, 6, 480840) I waited for it, but since none came I am writing this.
('59', 271, 3, 7, 480896) Ceaseless efforts are being made to persuade Harijans to follow the rules of cleanliness and hygiene.
('59', 271, 3, 8, 480998) Others may not distinguish between the different aspects of my work for Harijans, but why don’t you do so, and help me in regard to those which you accept?
('59', 271, 3, 9, 481154) I hope you don’t doubt my intention or ability to adhere to a decision firmly made.
('59', 271, 3, 10, 481238) It was my elders who joined themselves in a mutual bond with the Patwari family and, following in their foot steps, I became personally indebted to you and have, therefore, always looked upon you as a respected elder.
('59', 271, 3, 11, 481456) How can I give up this respectful attitude and why do you try to make me give it up?
('59', 271, 3, 12, 481541) What does it matter if there are differences of opinion between us?
('59', 271, 3, 13, 481609) Haven’t I such a difference with my sister too?
('59', 271, 3, 14, 481657) But she does not cease to be my elder sister for that reason.
('59', 271, 3, 15, 481719) My family has had the same kind of bond with the Patwari family for half a century and I, for my part, will not break it.

('59', 271, 9, 23, 482021) Do not be impatient but learn as much from the Yogashram as you can.
('59', 271, 9, 24, 482090) I have seen many who thought that they had learnt much in a short time, but repented afterwards.
('59', 271, 9, 25, 482187) You should not, therefore, be impatient.
('59', 271, 9, 26, 482228) You need not try Madan’s treatments, but it would be worthwhile to see whether his institution is actually running and how.
('59', 271, 9, 27, 482352) Come here at 12 noon on Saturday.

('59', 272, 13, 20, 483154) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter of 11th instant.
('59', 272, 13, 21, 483203) I referred to Sjt.
('59', 272, 13, 22, 483222) Gangadharrao and he says: “So far as I can remember I do not think that you had given any authority to Mr. Chhapkhane or to anybody else to use the money as he liked.
('59', 272, 13, 23, 483389) It was understood that the amount collected at the meeting should be sent either to me or to you.
('59', 272, 13, 24, 483487) The amount collected in the tour was to be applied to khadi.” Your letter appears to be positive.
('59', 272, 13, 25, 483585) I myself have no recollection whatsoever but it is most unusual for me when I am touring for a specific purpose and with a responsible man like Sjt.

('59', 273, 1, 4, 483943) Chhapkhane himself as to what he knows about it.
('59', 273, 1, 5, 483992) I must dissent from the proposition you have laid down that a person has no control over the monies entrusted by him to another for disposal even when the amount is unspent.
('59', 273, 1, 6, 484166) But the first thing to determine is what was actually intended by me when the money was left with you.
('59', 273, 1, 7, 484269) I take it that from now you will not make any use of the money till the matter is finally settled as to its control and disposal.

('59', 273, 6, 13, 484570) February 14, 1933
('59', 273, 7, 14, 484588) I have most carefully read Dr. Ambedkar’s statement 1 for which I cannot conceal my sorrow, but I must also confess he has a perfect right to make a statement as he has done.
('59', 273, 7, 15, 484763) Harijans have laboured under grievous wrongs for ages, and Dr. Ambedkar and other educated Harijans are fully conscious of these wrongs.
('59', 273, 7, 16, 484900) The marvel to me is that they are not more bitter and more resentful than they are.
('59', 273, 7, 17, 484984) Having therefore excused their position, I cannot travel the same length that Dr. Ambedkar would have me do.
('59', 273, 7, 18, 485093) He has asked me a straight question, and is entitled to an equally straight answer from me.
('59', 273, 7, 19, 485185) I have described myself as a Harijan by adoption and in order to qualify myself for the privilege that it is to me, I have endeavoured to enter the very depths of their feelings.
('59', 273, 7, 20, 485364) I have lived with them, dined with them, and they have always claimed the first place in my thoughts and my prayers.
('59', 273, 7, 21, 485481) I have done so not to do any favour to them, but as a matter of religious duty.
('59', 273, 7, 22, 485561) I am a Hindu not merely because I was born in the Hindu fold,

('59', 274, 1, 2, 485715) but I am one by conviction and choice.
('59', 274, 1, 3, 485754) As I know it and interpret it, it gives me all the solace I need, both here and hereafter.
('59', 274, 1, 4, 485845) It solves for me many riddles of life.
('59', 274, 1, 5, 485884) But it also contains, as it is practised today, the big blot of untouchability in the sense in which it is understood today, that is, distinction between man and man, one occupying the topmost rung of the ladder and another the lowest.
('59', 274, 1, 6, 486120) If this doctrine of utmost superiority and utmost inferiority, descending from father to son for eternity, is an integral part of Hinduism without the slightest prospect of a change, then I no more want to belong to it than does Dr. Ambedkar.
('59', 274, 1, 7, 486363) But I am convinced that this doctrine of eternal damnation is a thing utterly foreign to the spirit of Hinduism and the Shastras as I have understood them.
('59', 274, 1, 8, 486519) There is no superiority or inferiority in the Hinduism of my conception.
('59', 274, 1, 9, 486592) Therefore I should go the whole length with Dr. Ambedkar in fighting the arrogation of superiority on the part of any individual or class over any other.
('59', 274, 1, 10, 486746) My fight against untouchability is a fight against this horrid doctrine.
('59', 274, 1, 11, 486819) If untouchability goes from the heart of Hindus, superiority and inferiority are also gone.
('59', 274, 1, 12, 486911) But when Dr. Ambedkar wants to fight varnashrama itself I cannot be in his camp, because I believe varnashrama to be an integral part of Hinduism.
('59', 274, 1, 13, 487058) It is quite evident that the varnashrama of Dr. Ambedkar’s conception is being practised today, but that is not my conception of varnashrama.
('59', 274, 1, 14, 487200) In my opinion, at present both varnadharma and ashramadharma are in abeyance, and if I were asked what varna is in operation at present, I would say Shudra varna, not because it is the lowest, but because it is the only thing that remains, for the divine knowledge, the power behind it and wealth for the support of this knowledge and power are gone.
('59', 274, 1, 15, 487551) Knowledge, power and wealth there certainly are in a way.
('59', 274, 1, 16, 487609) But in the religious conception of varnadharma, these three have to be used not for personal ends, but for spiritual and social advance.
('59', 274, 1, 17, 487746) The only thing that remains open for all today is service, also included in the scheme of varnashramadharma, for a spiritual end.
('59', 274, 1, 18, 487876) Out of that spirit of service, it is possible to revive spiritual knowledge, the power to defend it and the wealth to sustain both.
('59', 274, 1, 19, 488008) Then, those who are in possession of that knowledge, and will use it for society will be Brahmins, those who use that power for the benefit of society will be Kshatriyas, and those who gain wealth and use wealth, also for society, are Vaishyas.
('59', 274, 1, 20, 488253) They will all depend for their very existence on Shudras, the embodiments of real service.
('59', 274, 1, 21, 488344) For me that is true varnashrama, and there is no question
('59', 275, 0, 1, 488402) 276 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 275, 1, 2, 488444) of superiority or inferiority in this conception.
('59', 275, 1, 3, 488494) The Shudra is as necessary for society as the Brahmin.
('59', 275, 1, 4, 488549) Each will have, more or less, all the qualities and privileges of the rest, but people belonging to particular varnas will perform the special service assigned to them.
('59', 275, 1, 5, 488718) There is then, in this conception, no question of privilege, but only duty and service.
('59', 275, 1, 6, 488806) I invite Dr. Ambedkar to shed his bitterness and anger and try to learn the beauties of the faith of his forefathers.
('59', 275, 1, 7, 488924) Let him curse the caste Hindus as much as he likes but let him not curse Hinduism without making an unbiassed study of it, and if it fails to sustain him in the hour of need, by all means let him forsake it.
('59', 275, 1, 8, 489132) Coming to the question of temple entry, I entirely agree with him that Harijans cannot be and must not be beggars for it.
('59', 275, 1, 9, 489254) It is for the caste Hindus to open temples whole heartedly or not at all.
('59', 275, 1, 10, 489328) I would repeat that the opening of temples is one of the duties that caste Hindus owe to Harijans.
('59', 275, 1, 11, 489427) I hope Dr. Ambedkar’s statement is not intended to convey the meaning that Harijans do not feel the deprivation of the right to temple entry, for I know from personal knowledge that for thousands of them, it is a serious deprivation.
('59', 275, 1, 12, 489661) The betterment of their economic and educational conditions is undoubtedly required.
('59', 275, 1, 13, 489746) But no betterment of those conditions will give religious equality.
('59', 275, 1, 14, 489814) That can be attained only by admission into temples and all the religious consolation to which caste Hindus are today entitled.
('59', 275, 1, 15, 489942) This religious equality cannot be attained even by statute, but only when the heart of the caste Hindus is changed.
('59', 275, 1, 16, 490058) The Bills before the Assembly are not intended to force open the temples to Harijans, but only to make it possible for the caste Hindus to throw them open when the hearts of the majority are changed.
('59', 275, 1, 17, 490258) Dr. Ambedkar has confined himself to the criticism of the second Bill (Temple entry Bill on the model of Dr. Subbaroyan’s Bill).
('59', 275, 1, 18, 490387) In my opinion, this Bill is designed to test caste Hindu feelings.
('59', 275, 1, 19, 490454) When the hearts of the majority are changed, temples would be thrown open.
('59', 275, 1, 20, 490529) Surely, Dr. Ambedkar does not want forcible opening of temples.
('59', 275, 1, 21, 490593) I do not, for one moment, hold the opinion, which he does, that the majority of caste Hindus today are not prepared to open temples to Harijans.
('59', 275, 1, 22, 490738) Evidence of the Guruvayur referendum, despite Dr. Ambedkar’s belittling, is undoubtedly in favour of a change of heart on the part of caste Hindus.
('59', 275, 1, 23, 490886) The referendum in Madura too, recently published, points in the same direction.
('59', 275, 1, 24, 490966) There will be time

('59', 276, 1, 2, 491030) enough to show dissatisfaction and disappointment when caste Hindus had been given an opportunity of expressing their opinion.
('59', 276, 1, 3, 491157) Dr. Ambedkar, I observe, has remained silent about the first Bill (Untouchability Bill).
('59', 276, 1, 4, 491246) It withdraws the recognition of secular law from the recognition of religious belief.
('59', 276, 1, 5, 491332) I hope he has no objection to this Bill, but whether he has or not, caste Hindus have a duty to perform, that is, to secure the passage of the Bills with the utmost despatch.

('59', 276, 4, 8, 491595) February 15, 1933
('59', 276, 5, 9, 491613) DEAR MAJOR BHANDARI, There are two matters that I have discussed with you, with which you have told me you have no authority to deal.
('59', 276, 5, 10, 491747) The first matter relates to the supply of newspapers to me in terms of the orders of the Government of India, giving me special facilities about untouchability propaganda.
('59', 276, 5, 11, 491919) Somehow or other hitherto I have managed to cope with my work in spite of restrictions that you have been exercising about newspapers addressed to me.
('59', 276, 5, 12, 492070) I have already drawn your attention to very important matters escaping my notice owing to the non delivery of these papers.
('59', 276, 5, 13, 492194) However careful your staff may be, they cannot always be sure of having all the cuttings relating to untouchability in the papers received.
('59', 276, 5, 14, 492334) Some papers such as Dr. Ambedkar’s I have to look through fully and carefully.
('59', 276, 5, 15, 492413) So far as I read the Government of India orders they contemplate no restrictions on the prompt receipt by me of correspondence and newspapers.
('59', 276, 5, 16, 492556) It is obvious that I cannot carry on propaganda if I do not get such things in proper time.
('59', 276, 5, 17, 492648) I therefore ask that all the newspapers received for me and which do not come under the heading of “prohibited literature” should be delivered to me as they arrive.
('59', 276, 5, 18, 492813) Of course they may be taken away from me as soon as I have used them.
('59', 276, 5, 19, 492883) I need hardly repeat the assurance that I have no use for them save for the one purpose to which all my energy and attention are being exclusively directed.
('59', 276, 5, 20, 493040) I shall therefore thank you to obtain necessary and early instructions in the matter.
('59', 276, 5, 21, 493126) The second matter is about the new weekly Harijan which is being published in Poona in the interest of the Servants of Untouchables Society.
('59', 276, 5, 22, 493267) Its policy is naturally being controlled by me
('59', 277, 0, 1, 493314) 278 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 277, 1, 2, 493356) as it has been published at my instance.
('59', 277, 1, 3, 493397) It has therefore to deal exclusively with questions relating to untouchability only and therefore it is a purely socio religious weekly.
('59', 277, 1, 4, 493534) I ask you whether copies could be sent to my associates and fellow prisoners whether belonging to ‘B’ class or ‘C’ class.
('59', 277, 1, 5, 493656) I would thank you if you will kindly ask for Government’s instructions on my request.
('59', 277, 1, 6, 493742) I may draw the attention of the Government to the fact that in 1922 when I was admitted into this Prison as a convicted prisoner and when in all other matters except food and sanitary conveniences I had no facilities given to me except what were permitted to other prisoners, there never was any difficulty about my getting newspapers of a purely socio religious character.
('59', 277, 1, 7, 494116) I hope, therefore, there will be none this time about the giving of Harijan to my friends, the fellow prisoners.
('59', 277, 1, 8, 494229) Lastly, will you please convey my thanks to the Government for their very prompt attention to my letters 1 about Shrimati Mirabehn (Slade) and Appasaheb Patwardhan.
('59', 277, 2, 9, 494394) Yours sincerely,

('59', 277, 7, 15, 494566) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL, In the hope of giving you a good letter against your splendid letter 2 I have been postponing writing to you.
('59', 277, 7, 16, 494696) But I can do so no longer.
('59', 277, 7, 17, 494723) Daily the work is increasing.
('59', 277, 7, 18, 494753) I must therefore write now and do the best I can.
('59', 277, 7, 19, 494803) I wonder if you are allowed an innocent paper like Harijan.
('59', 277, 7, 20, 494863) I am sending it in the hope that you will get it.
('59', 277, 7, 21, 494913) If you do, you will please let me have your opinion.
('59', 277, 7, 22, 494966) The fight against sanatanists is becoming more and more interesting if also increasingly difficult.
('59', 277, 7, 23, 495066) The one good thing is that they have been awakened from long lethargy.
('59', 277, 7, 24, 495137) The abuses they are hurling at me are wonderfully refreshing.
('59', 277, 7, 25, 495199) I am all that is bad and corrupt on this earth.
('59', 277, 7, 26, 495247) But the storm

('59', 278, 1, 2, 495484) will subside.
('59', 278, 1, 3, 495498) For I apply the sovereign remedy of ahimsanon retaliation.
('59', 278, 1, 4, 495557) The more I ignore the abuses, the fiercer they are becoming.
('59', 278, 1, 5, 495618) But it is the death dance of the moth round a lamp.
('59', 278, 1, 6, 495670) Poor Rajagopalachari and Devdas!
('59', 278, 1, 7, 495703) They are also in for it.
('59', 278, 1, 8, 495728) They are dragging out the engagement with Lakshmi and weaving round it foul charges.
('59', 278, 1, 9, 495813) Thus is untouchability being supported!
('59', 278, 1, 10, 495853) Sarup and Krishna 1 saw me the other day about untouchability and Indu 2 as part of the domestic interview.
('59', 278, 1, 11, 495961) Indu was in excellent health and seemed to be quite happy.
('59', 278, 1, 12, 496020) Sarup is having a brief tour in Kathiawar and Gujarat for anti untouchability and Krishna was to have gone to Allahabad.
('59', 278, 1, 13, 496141) Devdas is in Delhi helping Raja who is moving the M.L.A.s for the anti untouchability Bills.
('59', 278, 1, 14, 496234) Our time is being wholly occupied by the untouchability work.
('59', 278, 1, 15, 496296) Sardar Vallabhbhai contributes all the envelopes for the ever increasing number of outgoing letters.
('59', 278, 1, 16, 496397) He is the diligent newspaper reader who digs out odd bits of information on untouchability and what not.
('59', 278, 1, 17, 496502) He is also a factory for the inexhaustible supply of mirth.
('59', 278, 1, 18, 496562) The inspection day is just the same to him as any other day.
('59', 278, 1, 19, 496623) He never has any request to make.
('59', 278, 1, 20, 496657) With me never a day passes but I have some request to make.
('59', 278, 1, 21, 496717) But I do not know which is the happier.
('59', 278, 1, 22, 496757) Why may I not be as happy as he, if I can take my defeats without pulling a long face!
('59', 278, 1, 23, 496844) We all envy your solitude and your studies.
('59', 278, 1, 24, 496888) It is true that our burdens are of our own making or more accurately of my making.
('59', 278, 1, 25, 496971) I have dashed to pieces all Vallabhbhai’s hope of becoming a good Sanskrit scholar.
('59', 278, 1, 26, 497055) He can’t concentrate on his studies in the midst of the excitement of Harijan work and the daily dish of spiced criticism which he enjoys like the Bengal footballers their game.
('59', 278, 1, 27, 497233) Mahadev continues to be what Shaukat described him to be—the hamal 3 of the party.
('59', 278, 1, 28, 497316) No work is too much for him or beyond him.
('59', 278, 1, 29, 497359) Chhaganlal Joshi is still finding his feet.
('59', 278, 1, 30, 497403) But he is flourishing.
('59', 278, 1, 31, 497426) With the spring now well on us, he cannot fail to blossom out.
('59', 278, 1, 32, 497489) We are not a bad assortment.
('59', 278, 1, 33, 497518) We observe the rules of the game and so make a fairly decent family strictly regulated by the code of varnashrama which between Dr. Ambedkar and me will soon provide a new sensation for the sanatanists.
('59', 278, 1, 34, 497721) More trouble for me but none of my seeking, I assure

('59', 279, 5, 7, 498067) MY DEAR THAKKAR BAPA, I have your letter of the 9th instant, regarding Travancore Christian Pulayas.
('59', 279, 5, 8, 498168) If they are unapproachable I don’t know that we can exclude them from our service.
('59', 279, 5, 9, 498251) After all, what is the service?
('59', 279, 5, 10, 498283) The admission to schools we may not refuse to Christian unapproachables, or to wells.
('59', 279, 5, 11, 498369) Again we may not refuse to share the wells with them.
('59', 279, 5, 12, 498423) The line has to be drawn at the temples of course.
('59', 279, 5, 13, 498474) Therefore you can say that Christian unapproachables would be entitled to the same civic services as the other unapproachables.
('59', 279, 5, 14, 498602) When it comes to the question of giving individual scholarships, there may be a difficulty.
('59', 279, 5, 15, 498694) But I am not inclined to anticipate and provide against it now.
('59', 279, 5, 16, 498758) When it comes, we shall deal with it.

('59', 280, 1, 2, 499504) ‘service’ and without the slightest mental reservation as to making them Christians.
('59', 280, 1, 3, 499589) Their ambition should be to make them better Hindus and better members of society.
('59', 280, 1, 4, 499672) You should tell Mr. Simon plainly that unless we have that guarantee, we may not make the experiment of employing non Hindu agencies.
('59', 280, 1, 5, 499806) If Mr. Simon undertakes work under those conditions he should be entrusted with it and called upon not only to render at least a fortnightly report to you but to keep himself in touch with the local branch of the Society.
('59', 280, 1, 6, 500028) You should also find out through Christian friends from St. Stephen’s College what they can say about Mr. Simon.

('59', 281, 3, 4, 500972) JANAKIBEHN, It is Jamnalal’s definite opinion that Om 1 should be separated.
('59', 281, 3, 5, 501049) His next suggestion is that Om should be placed with Varutai.
('59', 281, 3, 6, 501111) She will look after her carefully.
('59', 281, 3, 7, 501146) If, however, you have any objection to this, she may be put either in the Ashram or in Sharda Mandir according as you wish.
('59', 281, 3, 8, 501270) You should now select one of the three places, make the necessary arrangements without delay and inform me what you have done.
('59', 281, 3, 9, 501397) Jamnalal thinks that you will prefer the Varutai proposal to the others, and he himself likes it most.
('59', 281, 3, 10, 501500) As for Kesarbehn, Jamnalal intends to make arrangements for separation as soon as he is released.

('59', 281, 9, 16, 501783) BHAI PARIKSHITLAL, I got your telegram.
('59', 281, 9, 17, 501823) I did not mean Saruprani, Jawaharlal’s mother, but meant Sarupbehn, his sister, wife of Ranjit Pandit, who is in Bombay.
('59', 281, 9, 18, 501944) As Pandit belongs to Rajkot, Sarupbehn can be regarded as a Kathiawari.
('59', 281, 9, 19, 502016) The name given to her by her husband’s family is Vijayalakshmi.
('59', 281, 9, 20, 502080) She will reach Bhavnagar on 19th.
('59', 281, 9, 21, 502114) Consult Ramjibhai and fix up your programme.
('59', 281, 9, 22, 502159) Sarupbehn’s address is: Meher Villa, Laburnum Road, Gamdevi, Bombay.
('59', 281, 9, 23, 502228) If you can, send a weekly report of the progress of work in Gujarat for publication in Harijan.

('59', 282, 3, 4, 502521) RUKMINI, I forgot to reply to one question which you had asked in your postcard.
('59', 282, 3, 5, 502602) If the yarn spun by a person as contribution to the Spinners, Association is removed from the spindle and wound into a hank by somebody else, there will certainly be no violation of the yajna.
('59', 282, 3, 6, 502795) However, the porridge will be sweet in proportion to the quantity of jaggery which you mix with it.
('59', 282, 3, 7, 502895) Similarly, the yajna will be perfect in proportion to the labour which one puts in for spinning and producing yarn.
('59', 282, 3, 8, 503011) If the spinning wheel is got ready by one person, the yarn is moistened by somebody else, the length is measured by a third person and the yarn is wound into a hank by a fourth person and I only spin, I shall have done the yajna but shall deserve only pass marks.
('59', 282, 3, 9, 503275) Radhika’s ship of health is certainly weak.
('59', 282, 3, 10, 503319) One cannot say whether it will reach the shore safely.
('59', 282, 4, 11, 503374) BENARSILAL, Jamnalal is quite well.

('59', 282, 7, 17, 503613) I hope you received the special letter I wrote four days back.
('59', 282, 7, 18, 503676) I wrote it on learning of your fits.
('59', 282, 7, 19, 503713) But your letter contains no mention of the fits.
('59', 282, 7, 20, 503762) I gave the details of my food, etc., in that letter.

('59', 283, 2, 3, 503991) February 16, 1933
('59', 283, 3, 4, 504009) DEAR DR.
('59', 283, 3, 5, 504018) SAPRU, I thank you for both your letters 1 and your telegram.
('59', 283, 3, 6, 504080) I am approaching the members of the Assembly in my own way.
('59', 283, 3, 7, 504140) Though I have written to the Viceroy, 2 there is no reply from him.
('59', 283, 3, 8, 504208) Rajagopalachari and Ghanshyamdas are both doing their utmost to consolidate the opinion of the members of the Assembly.
('59', 283, 3, 9, 504328) I see that you have considered only one Bill 3. I would like you to consider the other also.
('59', 283, 3, 10, 504421) It is a very short Bill.
('59', 283, 3, 11, 504446) That also is before the Assembly and it is the first of the two to receive sanction for introduction.
('59', 283, 3, 12, 504548) Therefore I take it that it would be the first to be considered by the current session of the Assembly, if it is to be considered at all.
('59', 283, 3, 13, 504686) For ready reference I am sending you Rajagopalachari’s booklet containing both the Bills.
('59', 283, 3, 14, 504776) If it does not come into your hands at the same time that this letter does, you will perhaps not mind sending for the first Bill from the Leader office.
('59', 283, 3, 15, 504929) I would suggest your writing to the Viceroy.
('59', 283, 3, 16, 504974) Mr. Jayakar has written at my request.
('59', 283, 3, 17, 505013) Thank you for your enquiry about my health.
('59', 283, 3, 18, 505057) I am keeping quite fit and well.
('59', 283, 4, 19, 505090) Yours sincerely,

('59', 283, 6, 22, 505209) 1 Dated February 2 and 11. In his letter dated February 2, 1933, the addressee had expressed his sympathy and support for the campaign against untouchability and stated: “.
('59', 283, 6, 23, 505382) that even a moderate measure of this character has not much of a chance in the Assembly as it is constituted.
('59', 283, 6, 24, 505492) Meanwhile, my advice is that you should, over your own signature, address a communication to the members of the Legislature asking them to push forward this legislation.
('59', 283, 6, 25, 505662) I fear an attempt will be made to secure the circulation of this Bill, which, in my opinion, will be tantamount to shelving it for the time being.
('59', 283, 6, 26, 505809) orthodox opinion may well be presumed to be hostile to it.
('59', 283, 6, 27, 505868) It seems to me a clash with that opinion is inevitable.” For extracts from his letter dated February 11, vide “Dr. Sapru on Untouchability Bills”, 25 2 1933.

('59', 284, 2, 3, 506198) February 16, 1933
('59', 284, 3, 4, 506216) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('59', 284, 3, 5, 506249) I endeavoured to send you as full a reply as the time at my disposal would permit me to send.
('59', 284, 4, 6, 506343) I entirely endorse your suggestion that just as others learn from the Gods and the scriptures what they want to, so must I. Some people learn only by making blunders.
('59', 284, 4, 7, 506510) I have often found myself doing so, but I don’t regret for the simple reason that at the time I made the blunders I was wholly unconscious of them.
('59', 284, 4, 8, 506658) I try to be cautious, but however cautious I may be, unless I become a perfect man, I cannot become proof against unconscious errors.
('59', 284, 4, 9, 506792) But so long as I retain the capacity to own them frankly and fully as soon as I become conscious, it is well with me and well even with those who may be affected by my errors.
('59', 284, 4, 10, 506968) If by fear of blunder I hesitated to act at all I should never succeed in reaching truth.
('59', 284, 5, 11, 507058) I must persist in saying that the Bills before the Assembly are in no way intended to compel anybody to act contrary to his conscience.
('59', 284, 5, 12, 507194) I quite see your own viewpoint.
('59', 284, 5, 13, 507226) It is my misfortune that I cannot make you see mine.
('59', 284, 5, 14, 507279) I can therefore only ask you to be patient with me.

('59', 285, 7, 10, 507908) AMBEDKAR, I thank you for your letter of the 12th instant enclosing your statement.
('59', 285, 7, 11, 507992) I did not receive anything from the Associated Press, but I saw it in the daily Press.
('59', 285, 7, 12, 508079) I hope you saw my reply 2. I wish that you could appreciate my viewpoint.

('59', 285, 11, 16, 508234) February 16, 1933
('59', 285, 12, 17, 508252) Commenting on the statement in the News Chronicle that untouchability is an
('59', 285, 13, 18, 508328) evil extraordinarily difficult to uproot by legislation alone, Mr. Gandhi said: I am not surprised at the ignorance betrayed by the writer in the News Chronicle when we have in India itself obstinate refusal on the part of many people to see that there is nothing at all in the two Bills in the shape of compulsion.
('59', 285, 13, 19, 508644) I could understand the difficulty, if there was a measure to abolish untouchability by law.
('59', 285, 13, 20, 508736) Again, the writer asks whether the Government ought to regard the abolition of untouchability as a duty imposed on it by consider ations of humanity such as compelled it to abolish suttee.
('59', 285, 13, 21, 508925) Surely, a comparison between the Suttee Suppression Law and the present Bills is most misleading.
('59', 285, 13, 22, 509023) The practice of suttee is a penal offence, whereas the present Bill merely withholds legal recognition from untoucha bility.
('59', 285, 13, 23, 509148) In my opinion, the Government is morally bound to help the reformers to adopt reforms wherever public opinion is ripe for it.
('59', 285, 14, 24, 509274) 1 The addressee had welcomed the opportunity of going to the Ashram provided it was treated by both as an experiment, with no pledge as to the future on either side.
('59', 285, 14, 25, 509440) 2 Vide “Interview to Associated Press”, 14 2 1933
('59', 286, 0, 1, 509490) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 287
('59', 286, 1, 2, 509535) British journalists should recognize the correctness of the reformers’ position.
('59', 286, 1, 3, 509616) They do not seek to bring about reforms by compulsion.
('59', 286, 1, 4, 509671) Not to pass these measures will be a block on the progress of reform, which is being prosecuted by reformers against heavy odds.
('59', 286, 2, 5, 509800) Asked if he was doing anything to persuade the members of the Assembly to facilitate the passage of the Bills, Mr. Gandhi said that he had adopted the most effective step in sending Mr. Rajagopalachariar there to present his case and seek the assistance of every member, Hindu members for supporting the Bills, and non Hindus for facilitating consideration of the Bills in this session itself.

('59', 286, 5, 10, 510309) I had not much expected to receive a reply, since, if you wrote to everybody, you would soon exhaust the number of letters which you were entitled to write.
('59', 286, 5, 11, 510466) However, I got news about you from time to time.
('59', 286, 5, 12, 510515) When you are out of jail, write to me an account of how you passed your time.
('59', 286, 5, 13, 510593) My companions and I are quite well.
('59', 286, 5, 14, 510629) But you will know all about that from my letter 1 to Mira.

('59', 286, 11, 21, 510878) on Friday.

('59', 286, 11, 23, 510990) It suits me better.
('59', 286, 11, 24, 511010) For I have no time for personal letters on Wednesdays and Thursdays, both the days being required for Harijan.
('59', 286, 11, 25, 511121) Everything must go out of my hands by 6 p.m.

('59', 287, 1, 2, 511235) Thursday.
('59', 287, 1, 3, 511245) Hence though I must write on other days as well for Harijan, I must devote Wednesdays and Thursdays entirely to it.
('59', 287, 1, 4, 511361) This is almost as before.
('59', 287, 1, 5, 511387) The extra note that I thought I might have to write I did not and could not have written with but extraordinary effort.
('59', 287, 1, 6, 511507) I gather from your letter that you are not locked for the night.
('59', 287, 1, 7, 511572) You must take the fullest advantage of that liberty.
('59', 287, 1, 8, 511625) The best food you want is the freshest air all day and all night.
('59', 287, 1, 9, 511691) Therefore you should work outdoor during the day, if, as I learn, you have many neem trees in your yard.
('59', 287, 1, 10, 511796) You should sleep all night directly under the sky—not even the shade of the trees—dew or no dew.
('59', 287, 1, 11, 511893) The most direct contact with the stars is absolutely essential.
('59', 287, 1, 12, 511957) Dew causes no mischief so long as you are well covered from toe to neck and the head also if necessary and so long as your lips are tightly closed and you are sure that you are breathing only through the nose—to ensure this at the time of retiring you should take a few deep breaths through the nose whilst you are lying flat on your back with legs fully stretched.
('59', 287, 1, 13, 512323) You should set apart certain fixed time, say, five minutes each time for taking these breaths.
('59', 287, 1, 14, 512418) Then you will acquire the habit of always breathing through the nose.
('59', 287, 1, 15, 512488) Those who, without practice, think that they naturally breathe through the nose, are not always right.
('59', 287, 1, 16, 512591) They do not know when they breathe through the mouth.
('59', 287, 1, 17, 512645) Unfortunately in the majority of cases correct breathing is an acquired habit.
('59', 287, 1, 18, 512724) Tuberculosis is an impossibility with one who takes freshest air, drinks pure water, eats properly the proper quantity of the proper food and has proper exercise.
('59', 287, 1, 19, 512887) I have thanked the Government for removing you from Arthur Road.
('59', 287, 1, 20, 512952) They have done it promptly and well.
('59', 287, 1, 21, 512989) It is true that I had definitely asked for transfer to Yeravda.
('59', 287, 1, 22, 513053) But they must have their good reasons for not transferring you there.
('59', 287, 1, 23, 513123) Sabarmati is undoubtedly the next best, knowing you as I do—Sabarmati should be the best if you realized that though my body dwells in Yeravda, my spirit is to be found in Sabarmati.
('59', 287, 1, 24, 513306) The body without the spirit is like the Taj without Shahjehan a tomb!
('59', 287, 1, 25, 513376) You should have reported all about the glands to the Surgeon at Arthur Road.
('59', 287, 1, 26, 513453) We may not ask for transfers but we are bound to report our condition.
('59', 287, 1, 27, 513524) For the authorities hold our bodies in the expectation that we shall report all about their condition to them.
('59', 287, 1, 28, 513635) If we do not, we commit at least a technical, if not a full breach, of prison discipline.

('59', 288, 1, 2, 513770) You will therefore report every irregularity to the Superintendent who the Government tell me is an I. M. S. officer and therefore a fully qualified physician.
('59', 288, 1, 3, 513930) You should try to make your body 100 per cent proof against disease.
('59', 288, 1, 4, 513999) It is a great joy to me that you have Ba with you and Gangabehn and Kusum.
('59', 288, 1, 5, 514074) Have you no access to the others?
('59', 288, 1, 6, 514108) Tell Gangabehn 1 and Kusum that I wrote to both of them.

('59', 288, 7, 19, 514818) Herewith Dr. Ambedkar’s statement and my reply 2. The rest you have in Harijan.
('59', 288, 7, 20, 514898) I also want you to read the statements of the two Harijan leaders Rajan and Deorukhkar.
('59', 288, 7, 21, 514986) I have now heard from the Viceroy 3 in reply to my letter 4. The trend of it is that he insists upon circulating the Bills, and in the Assembly too there is little hope of a majority resisting circulation.

('59', 289, 1, 3, 515474) It simply shows against what odds one has to fight, and on the top of that has come Malaviyaji’s disagreement.
('59', 289, 1, 4, 515585) This legal difficulty is an unexpected thunderbolt, but one has to deal with such difficulties also.
('59', 289, 1, 5, 515686) I had expected that the Government would not help to impede the progress of reform.

('59', 289, 6, 12, 515927) MY DEAR AGATHA, I have your letter with the two enclosures which you dug out of Andrews’s pocket.
('59', 289, 6, 13, 516025) Now that I give you a long letter in the shape of Harijan, you must not expect personal letters except rarely.
('59', 289, 6, 14, 516136) I know that you are working full speed and that is all we can do.
('59', 289, 6, 15, 516202) The results are controlled by the Infinite Power, and hence we may not worry.
('59', 289, 6, 16, 516280) I have enclosed a number of important cuttings with Andrews’s letter.

('59', 290, 6, 7, 517001) MY DEAR CHILD, Nowadays my time is more than fully occupied.
('59', 290, 6, 8, 517062) Two clear days have to be given to Harijan to the exclusion of every other work.
('59', 290, 6, 9, 517143) Therefore brief as they were, my love letters have to be briefer still.
('59', 290, 6, 10, 517215) But there is some compensation in that you have my general letter in the form of Harijan.
('59', 290, 6, 11, 517305) I know quite well what my visit to London meant to you.
('59', 290, 6, 12, 517361) We do not know God’s hidden ways.
('59', 290, 6, 13, 517395) If we only submit to Him, He makes us do many things even unconsciously to ourselves.
('59', 290, 6, 14, 517481) It will be such a joy to me if you never find yourself in the Valley of Despair, for, to be there even for one moment means lack of faith in a living God.

('59', 291, 1, 3, 518362) You will only come when the way is perfectly clear for you.
('59', 291, 1, 4, 518422) Surely, it is possible for you to love India even from where you are and to do many acts of service.
('59', 291, 1, 5, 518523) You have plenty of years before you.
('59', 291, 1, 6, 518560) Go through the necessary training, keep India your goal, and some day you will gravitate here.
('59', 291, 1, 7, 518655) Of course you are like Lakshmi to me or Mira.

('59', 291, 6, 13, 518876) DEAR SATISBABOO, Your telegram was received yesterday.
('59', 291, 6, 14, 518931) A reply was sent most hurriedly.
('59', 291, 6, 15, 518964) I forgot therefore to give you my opinion of the name of the Bengali edition.
('59', 291, 6, 16, 519042) Why should it not be identical with the title of the English weekly, simply ‘Harijan’?
('59', 291, 6, 17, 519129) You will publish the Bengali edition as of the original, but you need not give and it should be wrong to give whole translation of everything that may appear in the English weekly.
('59', 291, 6, 18, 519310) You should give only a condensed translation of whatever appears in the English edition.
('59', 291, 6, 19, 519399) You will even omit certain things which may not be necessary for the Bengali reader and put in many other things, but nothing inconsistent with the tenor of the English edition.
('59', 291, 6, 20, 519577) You will therefore personally supervise every line that appears in it.
('59', 291, 6, 21, 519648) You will send me also for the English weekly whatever news you may have about the progress of the movement in Bengal.
('59', 291, 6, 22, 519766) Perhaps you have replied to the Manager of the Harijan as to the number of copies you want per week.
('59', 291, 6, 23, 519867) How is your work in the bastis 1 progressing, and how are you keeping yourself?

('59', 292, 8, 12, 520643) If you do that, I shall be able to write nothing which may help you.
('59', 292, 8, 13, 520712) What I wrote certainly does not apply to you alone.
('59', 292, 8, 14, 520764) It applies to all, not excluding even myself.
('59', 292, 8, 15, 520810) We must know what an ideal mother should be.
('59', 292, 8, 16, 520855) I don’t think that you have enough knowledge to be an ideal mother.
('59', 292, 8, 17, 520923) Hard work may certainly help a woman to make up for part of the deficiency, but the original deficiency can be removed only by realizing it and taking the necessary steps to overcome it.
('59', 292, 8, 18, 521110) The practice of making the children brush their teeth before going to bed is a good one.
('59', 292, 8, 19, 521199) Massage the gums vigorously with your fingers.

('59', 293, 3, 4, 521436) NARANDAS, Wednesdays and Thursdays are devoted wholly to Harijan.

('59', 293, 3, 6, 521556) Amina’s problem seems to have been solved for the present.
('59', 293, 3, 7, 521615) How painful that a Muslim boy or girl cannot be admitted in a Hindu institution?
('59', 293, 3, 8, 521696) Of course Chandulal 1 or Nanabhai 2 are in no way to blame.

('59', 296, 3, 4, 525719) BRIJKISAN, Your letter.
('59', 296, 3, 5, 525743) That you two are together is to my liking.
('59', 296, 3, 6, 525786) 1 Both must be keeping fit.
('59', 296, 3, 7, 525814) Yes, you will have to give up the attachment to Mother and the brothers.
('59', 296, 3, 8, 525887) By our attachment we give them cause for hope and they are grieved when we cannot later fulfil their hope.
('59', 296, 3, 9, 525994) When they are made to understand clearly, they no longer harbour hope but acquire a healthy attitude.
('59', 296, 3, 10, 526096) We are all well.

('59', 296, 9, 15, 526221) DEAR SISTER, I have your letter.
('59', 296, 9, 16, 526254) You have not introduced yourself nor given your proper address.
('59', 296, 9, 17, 526318) Give me a weekly account of your work.
('59', 296, 9, 18, 526357) Who are the other ladies working there and what exactly are they doing?

('59', 297, 1, 2, 526780) 417. AN APPEAL TO M. L. A.S
('59', 297, 2, 3, 526808) A valued friend suggests 1 that I should send personal letters to the members of the Assembly bespeaking their support to the consideration, during the current session, of Sjt.
('59', 297, 2, 4, 526985) Ranga Iyer’s two Bills on untouchability.
('59', 297, 2, 5, 527027) I hope there is no false pride in me.
('59', 297, 2, 6, 527065) Having made up my mind, or, as critics would say, deceived myself into the belief, that in spite of my non co operation there was nothing wrong in asking the members to do what was right, I would not hesitate, if I was free, to go to them personally and show to them why it was necessary for all the members to allow the Bills to be considered without delay and for the Hindu members to back them for the sake of the purity of their religion.
('59', 297, 2, 7, 527508) But I am not free and I have found in Sjt.
('59', 297, 2, 8, 527551) C. Rajagopalachariar a better lobbyist than myself and perhaps better also at the art of wooing obstinate members.
('59', 297, 2, 9, 527666) He is, therefore, in Delhi as my duly authorized agent to plead my cause.
('59', 297, 2, 10, 527740) The public know what confidence I have in him as an exponent of and believer in whatever philosophy there may be in me.
('59', 297, 2, 11, 527860) Therefore, it would be superfluous, and if it was any other agent, even discourteous to him, if I was to write directly to the members who, I hope, will regard Rajagopalachari’s appeal to them as much more than a letter to them individually.

('59', 297, 5, 15, 528157) The foregoing 2 is the text kindly sent to me by Sjt.
('59', 297, 5, 16, 528211) Jayakar of the Bill on untouchability which he had sought to introduce into the Assembly while he was a member.
('59', 297, 5, 17, 528323) It is important for three reasons: Firstly, it shows that he, as a distinguished lawyer and an equally distinguished Sanskrit scholar, considers that his Bill merely seeks to remove “obstacles”, created by British Indian courts’ decisions, in the way of the abolition, even by the people concerned, of customs which they may consider contrary to their welfare, morals or conscience.
('59', 297, 5, 18, 528706) Secondly, it is in substance a combination of the two Bills now before the Assembly and the country; and thirdly, it shows that

('59', 298, 1, 2, 528949) the matter has been before the country for several years and is in no sense new.
('59', 298, 1, 3, 529030) The British Indian courts’ decisions and rulings referred to by Sjt.
('59', 298, 1, 4, 529099) Jayakar have acted on the Hindu society as a deadweight which has stopped its healthy growth.
('59', 298, 1, 5, 529193) The two Bills, like Sjt.
('59', 298, 1, 6, 529218) Jayakar’s combination, seek merely to remove the deadweight.

('59', 298, 4, 9, 529327) Vasantlal Morarka writes from Calcutta:
('59', 298, 5, 10, 529367) We have already commenced to do work amongst the Harijans.
('59', 298, 5, 11, 529426) We have taken charge of 20 night and day schools in the bastis.
('59', 298, 5, 12, 529490) Nearly 500 boys and
('59', 298, 6, 13, 529510) girls are receiving instruction in these schools, and we are tackling the problem of having water pipes laid, sanitary conveniences supplied and of carrying on propaganda for the eradication of the drink evil and other evil habits.
('59', 298, 6, 14, 529742) Moreover, we had a meeting and sports organized under the chairmanship of Shrimati Saruprani Nehru.
('59', 298, 6, 15, 529842) Marwadi, Harijan and other boys freely mixed together.
('59', 298, 6, 16, 529897) Men and women also did likewise.
('59', 298, 6, 17, 529930) There was absence of all artificiality about this gathering.
('59', 298, 6, 18, 529991) Nevertheless, I must confess to you that the work in the bastis is very difficult.
('59', 298, 6, 19, 530074) I know what the work in the bastis is like.
('59', 298, 6, 20, 530118) Satis Chandra Das Gupta of Khadi Pratishthan has already described to me in graphic and heart rending terms the condition of the Harijans living in the bastis.
('59', 298, 6, 21, 530278) These difficulties may not daunt workers.
('59', 298, 6, 22, 530320) If removal of untouchability was an easy job, we would have achieved it long ago.
('59', 298, 6, 23, 530402) It is only now that we are having a foretaste of these difficulties.
('59', 298, 6, 24, 530471) But patience and perseverance will overcome even an Everest of them.
('59', 298, 7, 25, 530540) Harijan, 18 2 1933
('59', 298, 8, 26, 530559) 420. IS THIS BROTHERLINESS?
('59', 298, 9, 27, 530587) As sanatanists persist in their statement that untouchability, as we know it, is not a blot upon Hinduism and that Harijans are well treated and are a happy and contented lot, and as I know that some of them, if not many, honestly believe in that statement, it becomes necessary to demonstrate the fallacy of that belief and show that the treatment actually received by Harijans cannot possibly be worse.
('59', 298, 9, 28, 530992) Such demonstration will also give the reformer an idea of the work that is in front of him.
('59', 298, 9, 29, 531084) Even when sanatanists and reformers join hands, as they
('59', 299, 0, 1, 531140) 300 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 299, 1, 2, 531182) undoubtedly will one day, there will be work enough and to spare for several thousand volunteers.
('59', 299, 1, 3, 531280) Though I have written and I shall continue to write with vigour about the necessity of admission of Harijans to temples, I have never given and shall never give a back seat to the constructive work.
('59', 299, 1, 4, 531479) But what I am certain about is that admission of Harijans to temples will automatically quadruple the pace of constructive reform.
('59', 299, 1, 5, 531610) Here is, then, a free translation of a letter from a Gujarati worker among Harijans in parts of Gujarat near Ahmedabad: Harijans suffer great hardships from the so called higher classes.
('59', 299, 1, 6, 531797) In some villages they are not allowed to build verandahs for their houses.
('59', 299, 1, 7, 531872) They may not build houses with an upper storey.
('59', 299, 1, 8, 531920) They may not wear decent clothing, nor ride horses.
('59', 299, 1, 9, 531972) There can, therefore, be no question in these villages of Harijan children receiving any education or having a decent recreation ground.
('59', 299, 1, 10, 532109) The high class people will not even tolerate any discussion about reform.
('59', 299, 1, 11, 532183) The Harijans cannot take advantage of the Government instructions that they should have access to public places on the same terms as other Hindus.
('59', 299, 1, 12, 532330) And now there have sprung among them false sadhus and bavas 1 who under all kinds of pretences cheat them.
('59', 299, 1, 13, 532437) Then, there is the vicious habit they have copied from higher classes of having infant marriages and incurring expenses in connection with these marriages.
('59', 299, 1, 14, 532593) They do not hesitate to pay 30% interest on two or three hundred rupees that they must spend on the marriage of their children, and it often happens that these little children die before they come of age and so the whole of the expense becomes a complete waste.
('59', 299, 1, 15, 532855) These customs have resulted in a perpetuity of debts which continue to increase without the prospect of ever being discharged.
('59', 299, 1, 16, 532982) And, of course, they have untouchability amongst themselves.
('59', 299, 1, 17, 533043) The result is that those who are considered the lowest have to exist on what dirty water they can collect from anywhere.
('59', 299, 1, 18, 533164) This is from one of the latest letters.
('59', 299, 1, 19, 533204) The following is taken from a letter received by Sjt.
('59', 299, 1, 20, 533258) Amritlal Thakkar from one Mr. Simon, M. A., who is a missionary for Children’s Special Service in the West Godavari District.
('59', 299, 1, 21, 533384) 2 He writes from Narsapur and says:
('59', 299, 2, 22, 533420) 1 Mendicants 2 Vide “Letter to Amritlal V. Thakkar”, 15 2 1933
('59', 300, 0, 1, 533483) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 301
('59', 300, 1, 2, 533528) The principal untouchables are Malas and Madigas who live on the outskirts of the main village, far from the habitations of the caste Hindus, and are the worst untouchables in the sense that they live in an appalling environment of dirt and squalour.
('59', 300, 1, 3, 533779) The boys and girls live in huts under the most insanitary conditions and are ragged and dirty, as they have never understood or experienced the joy of being clean.
('59', 300, 1, 4, 533943) Their parents themselves are careless of the cleanliness and the education of their children, not to say of their morality.
('59', 300, 2, 5, 534067) I believe that such a condition is due to their poverty on the one hand, and the dirt to which they have become habituated from ages.
('59', 300, 2, 6, 534201) The Malapalem and the Madiga gudem are on the borders of the caste Hindus’ village, hemmed in, on all sides, by the encroachments of the paddy field owners.
('59', 300, 2, 7, 534358) The Malas are a coolie class employed only for field work and the Madigas are shoemakers.
('59', 300, 2, 8, 534448) The latter class eat the meat of dead animals.
('59', 300, 2, 9, 534495) So, they live outside the pale of decent society, caged like wild animals, treated worse than the most uncared for village dogs.
('59', 300, 2, 10, 534624) It is not possible for me to reject any of these two pieces of evidence as exaggerated, because I have been an eye witness to such things in other places.
('59', 300, 2, 11, 534779) Nor am I disposed to underrate Mr. Simon’s evidence because of his being a foreigner, for the simple reason that his letter has been written for the sake of doing some service through the Servants of Untouchables Society and, therefore, incurs the risk of being utterly discredited if he made an exaggerated report.
('59', 300, 2, 12, 535095) Even from the most selfish point of view, it can be shown that this criminal neglect of the manpower of the country is an economic waste which can never be exaggerated.
('59', 300, 2, 13, 535264) The same people, if they were made honourable and equal members of Hindu society, will add to the material and moral resources of the country to an extent it is difficult to conceive.
('59', 300, 2, 14, 535448) At the present moment they are a burden upon society.
('59', 300, 2, 15, 535502) For, they discredit Hinduism, and the depression of 40 million human beings cannot but drag down the other 260 millions with them.
('59', 300, 3, 16, 535633) Harijan, 18 2 1933
('59', 300, 4, 17, 535652) 421. WHEN IS IT POSSIBLE?
('59', 300, 5, 18, 535678) I observe that Sjt.
('59', 300, 5, 19, 535698) C. Rajagopalachariar and Sheth Ghanshyamdas Birla have, in a statement issued by them, referred to the possibility of another fast by me.
('59', 300, 5, 20, 535836) If these two friends have thus not hesitated to exploit such a possibility, it is not unlikely that others are
('59', 301, 0, 1, 535947) 302 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 301, 1, 2, 535989) doing likewise without my knowing it.
('59', 301, 1, 3, 536027) I have already sent a wire 1 to the two friends urging them not to repeat the mistake.
('59', 301, 1, 4, 536114) And hereby I warn all friends against copying their example.
('59', 301, 1, 5, 536175) Such exploitation robs a spiritual act of all its value.
('59', 301, 1, 6, 536232) The dreaded event may never come to pass.
('59', 301, 1, 7, 536274) All I know is that there is, so far as I am aware, no present possibility of its coming.
('59', 301, 1, 8, 536363) Pandit Malaviyaji, whom I regard as an elder brother, has sent me a loving message of which the following is the substance: You are in a hurry.
('59', 301, 1, 9, 536507) You must go slow.
('59', 301, 1, 10, 536525) Take care that pride of tapasya does not corrupt you.
('59', 301, 1, 11, 536579) Tapasya without humility is of no avail and may even be harmful.
('59', 301, 1, 12, 536644) There should be no more fasting.
('59', 301, 1, 13, 536677) I prize this warning.
('59', 301, 1, 14, 536699) I know that pride of merit damages a soul like a heinous sin.
('59', 301, 1, 15, 536761) I hope I am not consciously proud.
('59', 301, 1, 16, 536796) What I am, unconsciously and in spite of myself, God only knows fully and, to some extent, those who surround me.
('59', 301, 1, 17, 536910) I am not impatient with anyone.
('59', 301, 1, 18, 536942) I am, however, impatient of untouchability.
('59', 301, 1, 19, 536986) But I know that its destruction is no one man’s work.
('59', 301, 1, 20, 537040) God has suffered the evil to exist all these long years and He will remove it in His own good time.
('59', 301, 1, 21, 537140) Nevertheless, He expects all Hindus to do their duty.
('59', 301, 1, 22, 537194) Suffering even unto death and, therefore, even through a perpetual fast is the last weapon of a satyagrahi.
('59', 301, 1, 23, 537302) That is the last duty which it is open to him to perform.
('59', 301, 1, 24, 537360) Therefore, fast is a part of my being as, I hold, it has been, to a large or small extent, of every seeker of Truth.
('59', 301, 1, 25, 537477) I am making an experiment in ahimsa on a scale perhaps unknown in history.
('59', 301, 1, 26, 537552) That I may be wholly wrong is quite possible, but quite irrelevant to the present purpose.
('59', 301, 1, 27, 537643) So long as I am not conscious of the error, but, on the contrary, am sure, as far as it is humanly possible to be, of being in the right, I must go on with my pursuit to the farthest end.
('59', 301, 1, 28, 537831) And in this manner, but in no other, a fast or a series of fasts are always a possibility in my life.
('59', 301, 1, 29, 537933) I have undergone many before now since childhood.
('59', 301, 1, 30, 537983) There should be no alarm felt if they are undertaken for public causes.
('59', 301, 1, 31, 538055) Nor must anyone exploit them in anticipation.
('59', 301, 1, 32, 538101) When they come, they will produce their own effect and result, whether any body wills or no.
('59', 301, 1, 33, 538194) But it is wrong to speculate over the contingency.
('59', 301, 1, 34, 538245) I, therefore, implore the public to dismiss from their minds, and be unaffected by, the remote possibility of another fast by me in this

('59', 302, 1, 3, 538640) I will not be a traitor to God to please the whole world.

('59', 302, 3, 5, 538717) 422. AGREEING TO DIFFER
('59', 302, 4, 6, 538741) There are some whose friendship and co operation I prize beyond measure.
('59', 302, 4, 7, 538814) One of such men is Pandit Malaviyaji, whom from the time that we first met I have recognized as an elder brother.
('59', 302, 4, 8, 538928) Nevertheless, it has been often my misfortune to disagree with him.
('59', 302, 4, 9, 538996) Our disagreement, however, has never in the slightest degree dimi nished our mutual affection.
('59', 302, 4, 10, 539091) The correspondence published below 1 will show the reader how we have again found it necessary to differ.
('59', 302, 4, 11, 539197) Conscience is a hard taskmaster.
('59', 302, 4, 12, 539230) I do not propose to deal with all the points covered in the correspondence.
('59', 302, 4, 13, 539306) I would confine myself to the vital matter referred to in it, viz., the interpretation of the Bombay Resolutions.
('59', 302, 4, 14, 539420) In my opinion, with all the deference that I owe to Malaviyaji, I feel that the Bombay Resolution 2 which I give below has only one meaning.
('59', 302, 4, 15, 539561) Under it, responsible Hindus are bound to give to the Harijans through law that which only law can give.
('59', 302, 4, 16, 539666) This they are bound to do now, if at all possible, and wait for the swaraj Parliament only if the legal relief becomes an impossibility now.
('59', 302, 4, 17, 539807) It cannot be considered an imposs ibility till all effort humanly possible has been made.
('59', 302, 4, 18, 539897) My duty and that of the Hindus who accept my interpretation is quite clear.
('59', 302, 4, 19, 539973) We must ask all the members of the Assembly, and especially the Hindu members, to help us to fulfil the pledge given, not merely to Dr. Ambedkar and cultured Harijans like him, but to the dumb and suffering forty millions whom they seek to represent, and whom it should be the duty and privilege of every caste Hindu to represent equally with the leaders of the Harijans.

('59', 303, 1, 3, 540826) A legal bar can only be removed by a legislative act.
('59', 303, 1, 4, 540880) What an agreement amongst Hindus can do is to move the Government to give effect to it as was done in connection with the political part of the Yeravda Pact.
('59', 303, 1, 5, 541038) Those caste Hindus who strained themselves to ensure recognition of the political part of the Yeravda Pact are now doubly bound to give effect to the other resolutions which were the direct and natural consequence of the Yeravda Pact; and since in the course of complying with those resolutions it has been discovered that there is a legal difficulty which was not foreseen then, that difficulty has got to be removed at the earliest possible moment.
('59', 303, 1, 6, 541489) Hence the two Bills.
('59', 303, 1, 7, 541510) But, says Malaviyaji, temple entry, the opening of wells, etc., had to be done by persuasion, not by compulsion.
('59', 303, 1, 8, 541623) I quite agree, but to remove a legal bar is not to do the desired thing by compulsion.
('59', 303, 1, 9, 541710) There is the Madura temple.
('59', 303, 1, 10, 541738) If I am correctly informed, the trustees of that temple are elected by the Hindu voters.
('59', 303, 1, 11, 541827) They are pledged to open the temple.
('59', 303, 1, 12, 541864) By an overwhelming majority, the Hindu voters have desired the opening of the temple.
('59', 303, 1, 13, 541950) But, because of the legal bar, the trustees cannot open the temple to the Harijans.
('59', 303, 1, 14, 542034) Will it be compulsion to have that legal bar removed by law?
('59', 303, 1, 15, 542095) I can cite several other instances where willing trustees of public temples are powerless to give effect to the public demand and their own wishes.
('59', 303, 1, 16, 542243) I venture, therefore, to think that there is no escape from permissive and corrective legislation.
('59', 303, 1, 17, 542342) If the Bills are defective, the defect can be remedied.
('59', 303, 1, 18, 542398) I have submitted the Bills to two eminent lawyers for their opinion.
('59', 303, 1, 19, 542467) Jayakar’s the public will learn from another column of this issue of Harijan.
('59', 303, 1, 20, 542545) 1 I have also approached Dr. Sapru, 2 and I betray no confidence when I inform the public that he has already expressed his opinion in emphatic terms in favour of the second Bill, i.e., the Temple entry Bill, to which Malaviyaji has taken strong exception.
('59', 303, 1, 21, 542802) Dr. Sapru sees no compulsion in it.
('59', 303, 1, 22, 542838) I have invited him to examine the first Bill also.
('59', 303, 1, 23, 542889) Every legitimate difficulty can be easily met if the principle of securing immediate relief from the legal obstacle is admitted.
('59', 303, 1, 24, 543018) Therefore, in my opinion, the way before the reformer is quite clear.
('59', 303, 1, 25, 543088) He must invite the Government to facilitate consideration of the Bills

('59', 304, 1, 3, 543459) Success or failure is not his concern.
('59', 304, 1, 4, 543498) But earnest and ceaseless effort is his concern and is under his control, and he must not flinch, whether he is one or many.
('59', 304, 1, 5, 543623) Malaviyaji suggests that the Bills be circulated.
('59', 304, 1, 6, 543673) I have not been able to follow his reasoning.
('59', 304, 1, 7, 543719) If the Bills were of a compulsory character, I should not only support circulation, but perhaps I should oppose their introduction altogether.
('59', 304, 1, 8, 543862) But the Bills are purely of a permissive character.
('59', 304, 1, 9, 543914) They pave the way for ascertaining Hindu opinion in accor dance with rules laid down in the law itself.
('59', 304, 1, 10, 544018) I should be prepared to accept any amendment that would make it impossible to force the opening of a single public temple against the will of those who have been hitherto entitled to offer worship in the particular temple.
('59', 304, 1, 11, 544241) After all, what is wanted is not removal of untouchability by law.
('59', 304, 1, 12, 544308) If the Hindu heart harbours untouchability, it will be there, whether the law recog nizes it or not.
('59', 304, 1, 13, 544409) But the aid of law cannot be invoked to regulate religious belief, as it was invoked by sanatanists when the court decisi ons referred to by Sjt.
('59', 304, 1, 14, 544555) Jayakar were obtained.
('59', 304, 1, 15, 544578) Legal interference, therefore, was invoked by the very people who are today stoutly opposing the introduction of the Bills, which seek not to impose any compulsion, but to remove the existing compulsion, that makes impo ssible a due fulfilment of the pledge embodied in the Bombay Resolutions.

('59', 304, 3, 17, 544891) 423. TEMPLE ENTRY AND VARNASHRAMA
('59', 304, 4, 18, 544925) It is to be hoped that the reader has read Dr. Ambedkar’s statement and my reply 1 on the temple entry question and there anent on varnashramadharma.
('59', 304, 4, 19, 545075) I had intended to republish them in Harijan, but I see that it is not possible to do so without enlarging the size of a journal which is just entering upon the second week of its existence.
('59', 304, 4, 20, 545265) I have, therefore, relied upon the reader having read both Dr. Ambedkar’s statement and my reply.
('59', 304, 4, 21, 545363) Let the reader understand that Dr. Ambedkar does want temple entry, but he wants something more.
('59', 304, 4, 22, 545460) Very rightly, he would not beg for it.
('59', 304, 4, 23, 545499) Quite wrongly, he would not even help caste Hindus to

('59', 305, 1, 2, 545645) do the correct thing.
('59', 305, 1, 3, 545667) The more that he wants is complete destruction of varnashramadharma of his imagination.
('59', 305, 1, 4, 545755) Varnashrama to him means the essence of superiority and inferiority.
('59', 305, 1, 5, 545824) I admit that today varnashrama does mean that, if it also means much more, but the evil of high and low ness is represented by untouchability.
('59', 305, 1, 6, 545967) When, therefore, the latter is demolished, varnashrama will be purged of the very thing for which Dr. Ambedkar abhors it.
('59', 305, 1, 7, 546089) Varnashrama of my conception is a wholly different thing.
('59', 305, 1, 8, 546147) It exists only in name today.
('59', 305, 1, 9, 546177) Let the reader, therefore, be not led astray from the main purpose.
('59', 305, 1, 10, 546245) It will be time enough to look after varnashrama when the doctrine of high and low is demolished.
('59', 305, 1, 11, 546343) It is necessary, too, not to be disturbed over my definition of varnashrama.
('59', 305, 1, 12, 546420) I am aware that it will shock sanatanist friends, but they will permit me to act according to my reading of the Shastras and the whole spirit of Hinduism.
('59', 305, 1, 13, 546575) The letters that I receive from sanatanists do not tell me that they believe in the doctrine of high and low.
('59', 305, 1, 14, 546685) On the contrary, they protest against my statement that caste Hindus have regarded Harijans as inferiors, always to be kept at a distance.
('59', 305, 1, 15, 546824) Therefore, they should join hands in purging Hinduism of the doctrine of inequality of status, irrespective of their conception of varnashrama.
('59', 305, 1, 16, 546968) After all, only that conception which the masses accept will hold the field.
('59', 305, 1, 17, 547045) The scope of the present campaign against untouchability is strictly limited.
('59', 305, 1, 18, 547123) It will be a great pity to befog the public mind by raising before it the cry of ‘Varnashrama in danger’.
('59', 305, 1, 19, 547229) I am convinced that it is more in danger from those who will be blind to what is going on in Hinduism today than from Dr. Ambedkar who courageouly says: ‘I shall have nothing to do with varnashrama that would keep me and mine for ever at the bottom of the social scale.’ If we would find room for such as him in Hinduism, let us show him by our acts that varnashrama is not a vertical line but that it is a horizontal plane on which all the children of God occupy absolutely the same status, though they may be engaged in different pursuits of life and though they may have different qualities and different tastes.

('59', 306, 2, 3, 548016) February 18, 1933
('59', 306, 3, 4, 548034) DEAR MOTI BABOO, I had expected to hear from you after your visit to Allahabad.
('59', 306, 3, 5, 548114) Please make up the defect now.
('59', 306, 3, 6, 548145) I expect your criticism of Harijan.
('59', 306, 3, 7, 548181) You should also ask some responsible people to get subscribers and send me a weekly report of the actual constructive work done by the members of the Sangh 1
('59', 306, 4, 8, 548339) among Harijans.
('59', 306, 4, 9, 548355) The report should be unvarnished.
('59', 306, 4, 10, 548389) Please tell Panchanan Shastri Tarkaratna that he has keenly disappointed me.
('59', 306, 4, 11, 548466) Nothing pains me so much as a breach of promise.
('59', 306, 4, 12, 548515) He promised to prosecute his search for a meeting ground between sanatanists and reformers.
('59', 306, 4, 13, 548607) 2 I have heard nothing from him on the point.
('59', 306, 4, 14, 548653) He promised twice that he would send his son or someone equally learned to put before me his own view and to answer my questions and help me generally to understand the sanatanists, standpoint.
('59', 306, 4, 15, 548847) Is he still going to send some such person?
('59', 306, 4, 16, 548891) Again, his son was one of the pandits who were to have seen me.
('59', 306, 4, 17, 548955) I was grieved that he should have been amongst those who, in my opinion, behaved in a manner unworthy of learned men.
('59', 306, 4, 18, 549073) 3 I had to exercise great self restraint in drawing the curtain over the events of that painful day.
('59', 306, 4, 19, 549174) They were painful because those who should be repositories of the real Shastras seemed to be so wanting in dignity and ordinary courtesies of life.
('59', 306, 4, 20, 549322) This is the very first occasion when I have put my pen to paper in order to characterize the conduct of the learned men on that day, and I have done so because of my regard for Panchanan Shastri, and because his son was one of those Shastris.
('59', 306, 4, 21, 549565) If I accept anything from Panchanan Shastri, he should know exactly where I stand, and he should know what I think of those to whom he lent the weight of his name and the services of his son.
('59', 306, 4, 22, 549757) You will either send this very extract to him or its translation or go over to him and personally tell him what I have written to you.

('59', 307, 2, 3, 550179) DEAR FRIEND, I have your very touching letter, but you must not be bewildered nor be pained.
('59', 307, 2, 4, 550272) My reply was in Gujarati, but the translation you have read is fairly correct.
('59', 307, 2, 5, 550351) What I have said 1 in answer to the questions put by the ex Dewan of Morvi I have said repeatedly in my writings.
('59', 307, 2, 6, 550465) It could not have escaped you if you had followed my writings carefully.
('59', 307, 2, 7, 550538) Nor is it inconsistent with the law of heredity.
('59', 307, 2, 8, 550587) The law cannot be changed but if we know the law we will suit our actions in accordance with it and that is precisely what my answer means.
('59', 307, 2, 9, 550727) Essential qualities are transmitted from father to son.
('59', 307, 2, 10, 550783) If parties having like qualities marry, they carry out the law of heredity and therefore also the law of varna.
('59', 307, 2, 11, 550895) Such marriages have taken place in Hindu society ever since the establishment of varnashrama.
('59', 307, 2, 12, 550989) This ought to give you satisfaction.
('59', 307, 2, 13, 551026) You do not expect me to give you a detailed reply to the conundrums you have raised.
('59', 307, 2, 14, 551111) You will believe me when I tell you that I have not even the time for doing it.
('59', 307, 2, 15, 551191) If you will carefully follow the pages of Harijan, all your doubts will be solved But if they are not, you should dismiss me from your consideration.
('59', 307, 2, 16, 551341) The cause is far superior to me.
('59', 307, 2, 17, 551374) You and I live for the cause and work for it.
('59', 307, 2, 18, 551420) If I err in the common prosecution of the common cause, you will leave me and march forward towards the goal.
('59', 307, 2, 19, 551530) The limits of untouchability work are well defined.
('59', 307, 2, 20, 551582) Never mind my views of extraneous matters, such as caste and varna, intermarriage and interdining.
('59', 307, 2, 21, 551681) I am not presenting my views on these matters for public acceptance at the present moment.
('59', 307, 2, 22, 551772) I give those views for the satisfaction of enquirers, for I would have my friends and the public to know me as I am and not picture me as something they fancy but has no likeness to me.
('59', 307, 2, 23, 551958) If even this does not give you satisfaction, you must find time to come to me and discuss the whole thing with me till you have full satisfaction.
('59', 307, 2, 24, 552105) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('59', 308, 3, 5, 552466) Four people have been at it.
('59', 308, 3, 6, 552495) All of us four feel that it is to be re drafted altogether.
('59', 308, 3, 7, 552555) Shastri is at it just now.
('59', 308, 3, 8, 552582) You will please forgive me if I am not ready with my suggestions yet for some time.
('59', 308, 3, 9, 552666) It does not matter if it takes a little time, but whatever we give must be thoroughly sound and perfectly readable.
('59', 308, 3, 10, 552782) About the Harijan Day, I think that the announcement should come from you officially.
('59', 308, 3, 11, 552868) I will then support it.
('59', 308, 3, 12, 552892) It might be as well if a Harijan Day is desired to be proclaimed now and again to fix a day in the month or a day every two months so that people automatically know and it becomes a kind of a monthly or six weekly or bi monthly religious observance.

('59', 309, 3, 8, 554036) I have no doubt that it will come if it has not already.

('59', 310, 3, 4, 555583) DEAR FRIEND, I have before me your two letters dated 8th and 14th February respectively.
('59', 310, 3, 5, 555672) I would now ask you to cry a halt.
('59', 310, 3, 6, 555707) I esteem the great pains you are bestowing upon your compositions, but I must tell you that your arguments produce no effect on my mind.
('59', 310, 3, 7, 555844) Some of them I cannot follow at all.
('59', 310, 3, 8, 555881) Some of them are wholly irrelevant to the issue.
('59', 310, 3, 9, 555930) You often beg the question and equally often make assertions as if they were axioms.
('59', 310, 3, 10, 556015) In my opinion that is not the way in which you will drive the truth home to anybody.
('59', 310, 3, 11, 556100) I believe that I am very pervious to argument and that I have the capacity for seeing my critics’ standpoint.
('59', 310, 3, 12, 556210) You have prepossessed me in your favour by your courteous language and by your quietly accepting and acting up to my suggestion about the ornamentation of your letter paper.
('59', 310, 3, 13, 556384) I therefore approach your letter[s] with a desire to find substantial help from them, but you will excuse me for saying that I do not find any.
('59', 310, 3, 14, 556528) I would therefore now ask you to close this correspondence.
('59', 310, 3, 15, 556588) I would be guilty of discourtesy towards you if I left you under the impression that your argument was at all going home and that therefore you could continue your correspondence.
('59', 310, 4, 16, 556768) Yours sincerely

('59', 310, 7, 19, 556852) 431. LETTER TO F. MARY BARR
('59', 310, 8, 20, 556880) February 18, 1933
('59', 310, 9, 21, 556898) MY DEAR MARY, Our letters crossed with each other.
('59', 310, 9, 22, 556949) You are living up to the failing ascribed to your sex.
('59', 310, 9, 23, 557004) The Ashram has been made to rid each sex of its failings.
('59', 310, 9, 24, 557062) Will you get rid of yours and learn to give in your letters the things that should be there.
('59', 310, 9, 25, 557155) You have omitted to mention your asthma.
('59', 310, 9, 26, 557196) I hope it has left you entirely.
('59', 310, 9, 27, 557229) Puniam is usually spelt punyam.
('59', 310, 9, 28, 557261) You should learn the Devanagari script.
('59', 310, 9, 29, 557301) You will take no more than a week giving one hour daily.
('59', 310, 9, 30, 557358) Then you will know why
('59', 311, 0, 1, 557381) 312 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 311, 1, 2, 557423) you cannot express the original by puniam.
('59', 311, 1, 3, 557466) Even the ‘n’ does not give the original sound.
('59', 311, 1, 4, 557513) There are five nasal sounds in Sanskrit.
('59', 311, 1, 5, 557554) ‘Narandas’ is quite enough.
('59', 311, 1, 6, 557582) But the bad habit of attaching ‘bhai’ or ‘ji’ has been the vogue and takes the place of ‘Mr.’.
('59', 311, 1, 7, 557677) Strangers would use only the other suffix.
('59', 311, 1, 8, 557720) But you may omit either, if you are older than Narandas.
('59', 311, 1, 9, 557777) If you are younger, ‘bhai’ becomes necessary as a member of the family.
('59', 311, 1, 10, 557849) Being daughter to me, you are as sister to Narandas and every other member in the Ashram.
('59', 311, 1, 11, 557939) ‘Bhai’ means brother as ‘behn’ means sister.
('59', 311, 1, 12, 557984) Here endeth the first lesson.
('59', 311, 1, 13, 558014) You must not be impatient with yourself, if you pick up new things slowly.
('59', 311, 1, 14, 558089) They will all become easy and natural by determined practice.
('59', 311, 1, 15, 558151) Love from us all.

('59', 311, 5, 18, 558268) February 18, 1933
('59', 311, 6, 19, 558286) NARANDAS, I am sending a friend to you.
('59', 311, 6, 20, 558326) His name is Duncan Greenlees.
('59', 311, 6, 21, 558356) He is a B. A. of oxford University.
('59', 311, 6, 22, 558392) He was a teacher in a school in U. P. He has also been in jail.
('59', 311, 6, 23, 558456) He intends to devote himself to Harijan work.
('59', 311, 6, 24, 558502) I have advised him to stay in the Ashram for some time and see how he feels there.
('59', 311, 6, 25, 558585) If we and he find that he will be able to work with us, we may assign him some work.
('59', 311, 6, 26, 558670) So let him stay there and give him some work.
('59', 311, 6, 27, 558716) He should also do spinning and weaving.
('59', 311, 6, 28, 558756) He may be given teaching work too.
('59', 311, 6, 29, 558791) He is a man of simple habits and is a vegetarian.
('59', 311, 6, 30, 558841) Ascertain his requirements.
('59', 311, 6, 31, 558869) I am sure that he will not be a burden on you.
('59', 311, 6, 32, 558916) Give him the expenses of his journey from Poona to Ahmedabad, or credit the amount to his name.
('59', 311, 6, 33, 559012) It is likely to be between Rs. 10 and 12.

('59', 312, 3, 5, 559230) If you come on a Friday or Saturday and inform us in advance, you will be able to meet me.
('59', 312, 3, 6, 559321) It is not necessary to write to anybody in advance to get an interview with me.
('59', 312, 3, 7, 559401) It will be enough if you inform me about the date.
('59', 312, 3, 8, 559452) People can see me between 12 and 1.30. I will fix up about Joshi after you let me know the date.
('59', 312, 3, 9, 559549) Since Vimu does not want me to call her silly, I hope she has given up her tantrums.
('59', 312, 4, 10, 559634) BAPU [PS.] I just learn that Chhaganlal wishes that you should not come just now, but may come after three months.
('59', 312, 4, 11, 559749) If you want to, you may write to me about this.

('59', 312, 9, 16, 559945) But what is the use of a peahen who does not speak at all?
('59', 312, 9, 17, 560004) And your handwriting is no better than your peahen, and, moreover, the letter is written in pencil.

('59', 313, 3, 7, 560365) I am afraid .
('59', 313, 3, 8, 560379) 2 will not live in Bombay.
('59', 313, 3, 9, 560406) He has still not become straightforward.
('59', 313, 3, 10, 560447) 3 seems to be deceiving us.
('59', 313, 3, 11, 560475) She does not at all wish to do any work.
('59', 313, 3, 12, 560516) We, however, should support her as long as we can afford.
('59', 313, 3, 13, 560574) If, therefore, your suggestions have been acted upon and are working, continue the arrangement.
('59', 313, 3, 14, 560670) Read the letters to Marybehn and pass them on to her.
('59', 313, 3, 15, 560724) Did Father Lash make any suggestions?
('59', 313, 3, 16, 560762) Did you cultivate his acquaintance?

('59', 314, 3, 6, 561450) My suggestion was only that you should take advantage of her presence if you thought it necessary.

('59', 314, 9, 14, 561990) There has been no harm in your having got yourself operated upon.
('59', 314, 9, 15, 562056) But otherwise your explanation as to the cause of the trouble is correct.
('59', 314, 9, 16, 562130) It has its origin in the stomach.
('59', 314, 9, 17, 562164) The only remedy, therefore, is fasting followed by a period of light diet.
('59', 314, 9, 18, 562239) For some time you should live on milk and fruits.
('59', 314, 9, 19, 562289) What you have written about ahimsa is right.

('59', 315, 3, 6, 562681) I made the suggestion to Ramjibhai thinking that you would decline without hesitation if you had not still recovered fully.
('59', 315, 3, 7, 562805) In my foolishness I assumed that he would not use my name in writing to you.
('59', 315, 3, 8, 562882) You were quite right to decline.
('59', 315, 3, 9, 562915) Send Vidyabehn 1 or Sharadabehn 2 if you think it fit.

('59', 316, 13, 23, 564610) February 19, 1933
('59', 316, 14, 24, 564628) KAKA, I got your letter.
('59', 316, 14, 25, 564653) If milk, when taken without any other food, is not digested, it does no harm, but the milk which seems to be digested with the help of other food is not really digested but mixes with the food, and remaining in the body in the form of poison, it harms the gums, etc.
('59', 316, 14, 26, 564920) This is the view held by more and more doctors and seems to be correct.
('59', 316, 14, 27, 564992) You can have with milk oranges, grapes, pineapples, pomegranates and other juicy fruits.
('59', 316, 14, 28, 565081) They will prevent milk from causing constipation.
('59', 316, 14, 29, 565131) You should, therefore, start the experiment of milk diet as soon as possible and accustom your body really to digest it.
('59', 316, 14, 30, 565252) I make no distinction between milk and curds.
('59', 316, 14, 31, 565298) Some doctors,
('59', 316, 15, 32, 565312) 1 Literally, ‘by the name of God’
('59', 317, 0, 1, 565346) 318 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 317, 1, 2, 565388) probably most, believe that curds are more easily digested.
('59', 317, 1, 3, 565448) The curds should not taste sour at all—the curds which we used to make by adding drops of lemon juice to milk would be the best.
('59', 317, 1, 4, 565577) You should not drink the milk but sip it slowly.
('59', 317, 1, 5, 565626) It would be better to take a spoonful at a time.
('59', 317, 1, 6, 565675) To start with, you should take a quarter pound every hour.
('59', 317, 1, 7, 565734) Do not mind if you get diarrhoea.
('59', 317, 1, 8, 565768) It will stop in a few days.
('59', 317, 1, 9, 565796) You may drink the fruit juice separately at any convenient time.
('59', 317, 1, 10, 565861) In fruit juice, you should have the juice of six mosambis or of one pound of fresh grapes in two parts.
('59', 317, 1, 11, 565965) You should take about four pounds of milk or curds, and mix with it as much butter as may be necessary.
('59', 317, 1, 12, 566069) If you take milk in sufficient quantity, I doubt the necessity of butter.
('59', 317, 1, 13, 566143) But it will do no harm if it can be digested even in the absence of other food.
('59', 317, 1, 14, 566223) Doctors believe that, like milk, butter too does no harm if taken by itself.
('59', 317, 1, 15, 566300) See how I have described the benefits of milk.
('59', 317, 1, 16, 566347) But I have no choice.
('59', 317, 1, 17, 566369) I can find no plant or herb which can equal milk in food value.
('59', 317, 1, 18, 566433) There is certainly some truth in the belief that milk is a wholesome food even for yogis.
('59', 317, 1, 19, 566523) It is the only substitute for meat.
('59', 317, 1, 20, 566559) Only our vaids 1 could have discovered a vegetable substitute for milk, but, lacking zeal for dharma, they made no such attempt.
('59', 317, 1, 21, 566688) I have failed in my search and given it up.
('59', 317, 1, 22, 566732) We do not know if anybody else will take it up and succeed.
('59', 317, 1, 23, 566792) Perhaps in the West they may succeed.
('59', 317, 1, 24, 566830) Among us there is no one who possesses the necessary medicinal knowledge to make such a discovery.
('59', 317, 1, 25, 566929) We do not regard it as our dharma to acquire such knowledge and to make experiments with that aim.
('59', 317, 1, 26, 567028) Anybody who wishes to undertake the task should be inspired with zeal for the welfare of the cow.
('59', 317, 1, 27, 567126) He should be convinced that no milk other than the mother’s milk can be the proper food of a human being.
('59', 317, 1, 28, 567232) Such a person should then study medicine.
('59', 317, 1, 29, 567274) We do not have at present men with such a spirit.
('59', 317, 1, 30, 567324) If India is destined to discover such a substitute, God will send among us a person with the necessary gifts.
('59', 317, 1, 31, 567434) Till then, let us sing praises of milk and do the duty which lies before us.
('59', 317, 1, 32, 567511) I hope you will feel satisfied that I have replied to your question in greater detail than you had expected.
('59', 317, 1, 33, 567620) I also hope that you will understand the relative importance of the issues involved.
('59', 317, 1, 34, 567705) Think over all this and do what seems right to you, for even in such matters the final decision should be one’s own.
('59', 317, 1, 35, 567822) What I have said is true only about people with weak health.
('59', 317, 1, 36, 567883) Those who are healthy will eat normal food and may even be able to digest it.

('59', 318, 1, 3, 568268) I suppose you know that yogis mix crushed neem leaves in milk before drinking it.

('59', 318, 1, 6, 568488) You will get more information from the friend at Sangli.
('59', 318, 1, 7, 568545) An innocent egg is one from which no chick can be born.
('59', 318, 1, 8, 568601) Personally, I very much liked the design for the title page of Harijan.
('59', 318, 1, 9, 568673) It was entirely my choice.
('59', 318, 1, 10, 568700) At first we had thought of getting a block made.
('59', 318, 1, 11, 568749) But I liked the design better after it was printed and so the idea of getting a block made was dropped.
('59', 318, 1, 12, 568853) Shastra does not mean the pronouncements of men of spiritual experience in the past.
('59', 318, 1, 13, 568938) It means the words of living men today who have had first hand spiritual experience, that is, who have realized the Brahman.
('59', 318, 1, 14, 569063) Shastra is something which is daily embodied in somebody’s life.
('59', 318, 1, 15, 569128) What exists only in books and is not followed in life may be philosophy, or it may be foolish chatter or mere hypocrisy.
('59', 318, 1, 16, 569249) Shastra must be immediately capable of realization in experience, it must spring from the living experience of the person who utters it.
('59', 318, 1, 17, 569386) It is only in this sense that the Veda is eternal.
('59', 318, 1, 18, 569437) All else is not Veda, but theorizing about Veda.
('59', 318, 1, 19, 569486) 1 is resolved to marry .
('59', 318, 1, 20, 569511) he should ignore our opposition and do so.
('59', 318, 1, 21, 569554) There is no harm in doing that.
('59', 318, 1, 22, 569586) The Gita verse, “What can self control avail 2”, applies in this case.
('59', 318, 1, 23, 569657) But then the couple should have courage and confidence in themselves.
('59', 318, 1, 24, 569727) If the people ultimately see that they lead a life of self control, the world will forgive the couple.
('59', 318, 1, 25, 569830) It is such action which forsakes the rule of Shastra.
('59', 318, 1, 26, 569884) 3 If it is inspired by a pure and noble ideal, it is ultimately condoned.
('59', 318, 1, 27, 569958) But just now such conduct will be and ought to be disapproved.
('59', 318, 1, 28, 570021) Our duty, therefore, is clear.

('59', 319, 9, 14, 571056) DEAR SIR, I thank you for the reply 3 to my letter 4 addressed to the Private Secretary to the Viceroy dated the 1st instant.
('59', 319, 9, 15, 571182) There are two things about which I would like to make brief observations.
('59', 319, 9, 16, 571256) The Government have assumed without just cause that “education and the provision of the normal facilities of life” are not considered by me as the vital part of the Resolution referred to therein.
('59', 319, 9, 17, 571453) It was wholly irrelevant to the purpose of my letter to the Private Secretary to the Viceroy to state what was being done by me or through me in connection with these things.
('59', 319, 9, 18, 571628) Indeed I have shown in my writings being published in the course of the controversy that education and the like were being prosecuted with all the vigour possible and that the pace would be quadrupled by the temples being

('59', 320, 1, 3, 572075) As to the two measures now before the legislature, I may be permitted to point out that they are not intended to affect religious “customs and usages of the Hindu community”.
('59', 320, 1, 4, 572250) They are specially designed to leave that question to the community itself.
('59', 320, 1, 5, 572326) The law as it stands makes impossible the operation of the Hindu mind on certain religious customs and usages, and the measures are designed to release the Hindu mind from those fetters.
('59', 320, 1, 6, 572513) I would submit that it is the duty of the Government, which is pledged to neutrality in religious matters, to free the reformers from the shackles of, not of religious custom, but of the law.
('59', 320, 1, 7, 572705) For, had it not been for the law, it would have been open to the trustees, with the consent of the temple goers, to change the custom.
('59', 320, 1, 8, 572840) Nor may it be forgotten that the Bills have come before the legislature as a result of the formation of a very strong body of public opinion in favour of the change of custom.

('59', 321, 7, 13, 574533) DEAR MR. JAYAKAR, I was glad to hear that at the instance of Seth Bhagoji Kir you were going to open two temples in Ratnagiri to Harijans on the 22nd instant.
('59', 321, 7, 14, 574692) I hope that both caste Hindus and Harijans will appreciate this religious act of Seth Bhagoji Kir and that Harijans will take advantage of the opportunity they have now got of offering worship in these two temples.
('59', 321, 7, 15, 574907) I have no doubt that you will remind Harijan brothers and sisters that it is necessary in order to gain the full advantage of worship to conform to the obligations that lie upon all worshippers to observe the law of cleanliness, such as daily individual bath, wearing of unpolluted clothing and offering individual worship in the home, and abstain from carrion and beef eating and intoxicating liquors.
('59', 321, 7, 16, 575310) I am posting a copy of this to reach you at Ratnagiri lest this should reach Bombay after your departure for Ratnagiri.

('59', 322, 4, 9, 576355) You may depend upon it that speaking for myself personally, not even a single argument of the sanatanists has escaped me, or, so far as it was possible for me to do, remained unanswered.
('59', 322, 4, 10, 576542) I did enquire about the meeting 3 in Calcutta that you have referred to, and the information that I received was that the statements made were gross exaggerations.

('59', 323, 8, 15, 578149) Such errors come out of the depths of love—but love gone mad.
('59', 323, 8, 16, 578211) I mended the error by magnifying it a hundred fold and driving a rich lesson home to people.
('59', 323, 8, 17, 578304) I know that neither you nor Ghanshyamdas will repeat the error.
('59', 323, 8, 18, 578368) Where is the cause for it?
('59', 323, 8, 19, 578395) We simply work away.
('59', 323, 8, 20, 578416) Your reading of the Gita is perfect so far.
('59', 323, 8, 21, 578460) The A.P.I. news about 27 members did not disturb me in the slightest degree.
('59', 323, 8, 22, 578537) You are there delivering the message to everybody who will listen.
('59', 323, 8, 23, 578604) What does it matter now if nobody listens?
('59', 323, 8, 24, 578647) As it is you have made considerable progress.
('59', 323, 8, 25, 578693) Nor has Malaviyaji’s bombshell 1 disturbed me.
('59', 323, 8, 26, 578740) It was bound to come.
('59', 323, 8, 27, 578762) We have to have him with all his limitations as we consider them to be.
('59', 323, 8, 28, 578834) But his so called limitations are also his strength.
('59', 323, 8, 29, 578887) It may be wise not to worry him now by sending Devdas and Shankerlal.

('59', 324, 5, 12, 579597) February 19, 1933
('59', 324, 6, 13, 579615) MY DEAR SATISBABOO, I have your letter of the 15th instant.
('59', 324, 6, 14, 579675) The description you give of smallpox in the bastis makes painful reading.
('59', 324, 6, 15, 579749) I do not know how far that faith in Sitala Devi 2 is to be admired, and if it is to be admired, why should we undermine it?
('59', 324, 6, 16, 579873) It seems to me that by patience and perseverance we have to undermine this blind faith and show to the people that smallpox is like every other disease caused by irregular living and that it is amenable like every other disease to proper treatment.
('59', 324, 6, 17, 580122) I do not know how far you are justified in avoiding vaccina tion and perhaps encouraging co workers to do likewise.
('59', 324, 6, 18, 580238) Of course I myself am a fanatic about some of these matters.
('59', 324, 6, 19, 580299) But I never like people to copy fanaticism.
('59', 324, 6, 20, 580343) A fanatic has his own justifi cation.
('59', 324, 6, 21, 580381) He may never be copied.
('59', 324, 6, 22, 580405) Fanaticism must be instinctive.
('59', 324, 6, 23, 580437) It may be almost compared to the blind faith of the people whom you have described and who recklessly touch and mingle with smallpox patients.
('59', 324, 6, 24, 580580) But just as you and I cannot copy their blind faith with any prospect of success, so also may nobody copy anybody else’s fanaticism; and since you have such occular demonstration of the success of vaccination, unless you have your own independent faith and conviction that vaccination is bad you ought to be vaccinated and you should encourage your co workers to do likewise.

('59', 325, 1, 4, 581442) You should send me from week to week, if there is anything to be sent, a report of constructive work actually done in connection with Harijans in your part of the world, whether by you or others.

('59', 325, 5, 9, 581825) February 19, 1933
('59', 325, 6, 10, 581843) MY DEAR SURESH, I have been thinking of you almost every day, and not having heard from you for a long time, in my despair I dictated a message, quite selfish, to you, in my letter to Satisbaboo, and immediately I had finished that letter, Mahadev put your letter of 15th instant in my hands.
('59', 325, 6, 11, 582136) You can better imagine my joy than I can describe it.
('59', 325, 6, 12, 582190) I see you have been near death’s door again.
('59', 325, 6, 13, 582235) It is better perhaps to realize that we are always near death’s door, the healthy looking people no less than the ill looking.
('59', 325, 6, 14, 582362) I know many bed ridden people surviving the loss of dear ones who had looked pictures of health and who they had thought were bound to survive them.
('59', 325, 6, 15, 582511) Pray, do not become impatient.
('59', 325, 6, 16, 582542) Understand thoroughly the distinction I have drawn between caste and varnashrama.
('59', 325, 6, 17, 582624) Caste is a touch me not institution.
('59', 325, 6, 18, 582661) If untouchability goes, you will find that touch me not ism will go.
('59', 325, 6, 19, 582730) According to my meaning of it varnashrama has not the slightest tinge of touch me not ism.
('59', 325, 6, 20, 582821) It is a spiritual law just as valid as any physical law, whether we recognize its existence or whether we do not.
('59', 325, 6, 21, 582935) He who recognizes the existence of this law profits by his knowledge, even as a scientist, knowing the properties of a drop of water and the laws which are responsible for those properties, makes railway trains to move at a speed our ancestors had never thought of.
('59', 325, 6, 22, 583201) So also if we recognize the law of varnashrama

('59', 326, 1, 3, 583355) I can understand Dr. Ambedkar in his rage against caste Hindus refusing to see the wood for the trees, but you have no excuse whatsoever for not understanding the very clear distinction I have pointed out.
('59', 326, 1, 4, 583561) 1 In any case I am convinced that to precipitate a fight on varnashrama today is to do a great disservice to the cause of the removal of untouchability.

('59', 327, 1, 3, 584938) In two years’ time, Lalita will probably decide for herself.
('59', 327, 1, 4, 584999) The solution should be such as will not shock Nathabhai and as will safeguard the interests of Lalita.
('59', 327, 1, 5, 585102) We should have faith that we shall be able to find such a solution when the time comes.

('59', 327, 6, 9, 585284) PREMA, I am determined not to make this a long letter.
('59', 327, 6, 10, 585339) If you can win over Maitri and all the three sisters improve, I will certainly regard that as your and Ashram’s victory.
('59', 327, 6, 11, 585460) Narandas has tried the way of love.
('59', 327, 6, 12, 585496) See if you succeed.
('59', 327, 6, 13, 585516) You must have realized that Lakshmi must be married off now, or else she should leave the Ashram.
('59', 327, 6, 14, 585614) I do not think any of you should be burdened any longer with her responsibility.
('59', 327, 6, 15, 585695) Maruti is an exceptional young man.
('59', 327, 6, 16, 585731) Lakshmidas also has had a hand in his training.
('59', 327, 6, 17, 585779) You have found that what Moti had told you about him was not correct.

('59', 327, 6, 19, 585924) I liked your suggestion about Nirmala.
('59', 327, 6, 20, 585963) I have not yet been able to discuss it with Mahadev, though.
('59', 327, 6, 21, 586024) I also understand what you say about Prithuraj.
('59', 327, 6, 22, 586072) I am eager to know more details about the Muslim lady.

('59', 327, 6, 24, 586202) He has impressed me as a man inclined to a life of renunciation.
('59', 327, 6, 25, 586267) Look after his needs.
('59', 327, 6, 26, 586289) To which aspect of my behaviour, when you came to see me with Sushila, did your question refer?
('59', 327, 6, 27, 586385) I do not remember anything.
('59', 327, 6, 28, 586413) If you ask this question again, I will try to answer it.
('59', 327, 6, 29, 586470) I understand what you say about doctors.
('59', 327, 6, 30, 586511) Once we have put ourselves in a doctor’s hand, we should get from him whatever he can give.
('59', 327, 6, 31, 586603) Otherwise we shall not do him justice, and may do harm to ourselves.

('59', 328, 1, 4, 586963) Millions of people cannot consult them at all.
('59', 328, 1, 5, 587010) But I think that such self denial is beyond the capacity of the inmates of the Ashram.
('59', 328, 1, 6, 587097) We may, therefore, consult doctors who are reputed to be intelligent.

('59', 328, 6, 12, 587350) You should always write what you do after careful thought.
('59', 328, 6, 13, 587409) Anybody who wants to be scrupulously truthful would not utter or write even one word without care fully weighing it.
('59', 328, 6, 14, 587526) I had got confused by what you wrote.
('59', 328, 6, 15, 587564) Now everything is clear.

('59', 328, 6, 18, 587701) What does Jai Jai mean?
('59', 328, 6, 19, 587725) Does it mean the same thing as Jaya Jaya?
('59', 328, 6, 20, 587767) A person like me can afford to make a mistake in spelling a word.

('59', 330, 8, 18, 590644) I feel relieved.
('59', 330, 8, 19, 590661) We should take care and see that the children do not feel the burden of the Ashram life.

('59', 330, 8, 21, 590792) Keep me informed about Liladhar.

('59', 331, 2, 25, 592709) Tell Dr. Talwalkar about it.
('59', 331, 2, 26, 592738) If he approves of my suggestion, put up a sort of wall of hay or hessian or any other suitable material round the place where Kusum sits.
('59', 331, 2, 27, 592876) The wall should be such as can be removed every day.
('59', 331, 2, 28, 592929) Or you may select some other suitable place in consultation with the doctor and put up such a wall there and let her have sun bath in that enclosure.
('59', 331, 2, 29, 593079) If necessary, she may be carried there in a cot.
('59', 331, 2, 30, 593128) Find out whether it is necessary to obtain Government’s permission for putting up such temporary wall on agricultural land.
('59', 331, 2, 31, 593252) Patients like Kusum are known to have recovered by only taking sun bath with their bodies completely uncovered.
('59', 331, 2, 32, 593364) Some boys ask me in their letters to write “Blessings from” at least when I write to them.
('59', 331, 2, 33, 593455) Please remind all that in order to save time and spare the hand unnecessary work I don’t say it in words but leave it to be understood by the addressee.

('59', 332, 6, 15, 594509) DEAR GURUDEV, At the instance of Seth Ghanshyamdas you sent a poem 2 for the Harijan of which I hope you received the first issue.
('59', 332, 6, 16, 594640) Harijans are your special care.
('59', 332, 6, 17, 594672) I am therefore not going to be satisfied with that message only.
('59', 332, 6, 18, 594737) If you can send something occasionally it will be a source of strength to me personally and a help to the readers of Harijan in the midst of so much that is going on to undermine their faith.

('59', 332, 11, 24, 595057) February 20, 1933
('59', 332, 12, 25, 595075) MY DEAR JAISUKHLAL, If it is at all possible, I would like you to get the opinion of some legal friends on the following points.
('59', 332, 12, 26, 595204) I have already asked Sjt.
('59', 332, 12, 27, 595230) Jayakar to help me, but he will do so both as lawyer and politician

('59', 333, 1, 3, 595400) But if we can get four or five signatures from well known lawyers with his amongst them, I should value the thing all the more.
('59', 333, 1, 4, 595528) I do not know that, it is necessary to go through the stiff course of solicitors preparing a brief and submitting it to several advocates for their opinion.
('59', 333, 1, 5, 595685) I would like it to be a considered opinion of lawyers as public men applying their knowledge of law to a question of great importance.
('59', 333, 1, 6, 595820) The points to which I would like them to address themselves are these: 1. Is there any element of compulsion in any of the two Bills?
('59', 333, 1, 7, 595954) 2. Is there any interference with any person’s religious practice or conscience?
('59', 333, 1, 8, 596035) 3. In spite of the willingness of the trustees as well as the worshippers of a particular public Hindu temple, is not one of the two Bills at least or a measure like them necessary before it is possible for a public Hindu temple to be opened in view of the English Law of Trusts and known decisions of the High Courts in India?
('59', 333, 1, 9, 596363) You should approach Mr. Bahadurji on this matter.
('59', 333, 1, 10, 596413) But I do not insist; you know better what to do and how to do it.
('59', 333, 1, 11, 596479) You should attend to this as early as you possibly can.

('59', 334, 1, 5, 597360) If, however, I had kept him in the Ashram and somehow found him the money which he wanted, he would have let his thoughts run after immoral pleasures and would have been deceiving himself and the world.

('59', 335, 3, 6, 598666) It need not be of one fixed type.

('59', 335, 9, 16, 599011) She claimed an old connection with me.

('59', 336, 7, 10, 599956) February 21, 1933
('59', 336, 8, 11, 599974) DEAR MR. NATARAJAN, I thank you for your letter.
('59', 336, 8, 12, 600023) 1 I can never take amiss any intervention from you.
('59', 336, 8, 13, 600075) On the contrary, I have always welcomed it.
('59', 336, 8, 14, 600119) You will perhaps be interested to learn that the original draft of the Resolution on Temple entry and the like was also framed by me and handed to Sjts.
('59', 336, 8, 15, 600272) Purushottamdas and Ghanshyamdas Birla.
('59', 336, 8, 16, 600311) The Resolution as passed at the Bombay meeting is undoubtedly different from the one I had worded.
('59', 336, 8, 17, 600410) The essential features of my Resolution have however been kept in the Bombay Resolution.
('59', 336, 8, 18, 600499) Nevertheless I must apply to it the same canon of interpretation as we apply to Government’s ordinary laws and the like.
('59', 336, 8, 19, 600620) The intention of the author is irrelevant to the interpretation of his work if that intention is not carried out in his language.
('59', 336, 8, 20, 600750) I have therefore mentioned the fact of my authorship of the original text as a mere matter of historical interest.
('59', 336, 8, 21, 600865) If you will read the first Resolution 2 you will find the following:
('59', 336, 9, 22, 600934) This right shall have statutory recognition at the first opportunity, and shall be one of the earliest acts of swaraj Parliament, if it shall not have received such recognition before that time.
('59', 336, 10, 23, 601129) 1 The addressee had referred to the Bombay Resolution of September 25, 1932 and written: “Of course, the Pact itself was largely your doing and you are the best authority as to what it was intended to mean.
('59', 336, 10, 24, 601336) But the Bombay Conference, of which I was a member, did not intend more than Malaviyaji says.
('59', 336, 10, 25, 601430) Perhaps, less.” 2 Vide “Statement on Viceroy’s Decision”, 24 1 1933
('59', 337, 0, 1, 601498) 338 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 337, 1, 2, 601540) Therefore, the legislative aid was clearly contemplated by the resolution.
('59', 337, 1, 3, 601615) But I go a step further.
('59', 337, 1, 4, 601640) The meeting further agreed
('59', 337, 2, 5, 601667) by every legitimate and peaceful means to secure an early removal of all social disabilities .
('59', 337, 2, 6, 601762) including the bar in respect of admission to temples.
('59', 337, 2, 7, 601816) In the course of the conduct of the campaign one discovered that there was a legal obstacle in the path of the progress towards reform.
('59', 337, 2, 8, 601952) Surely, it is up to the caste Hindus to remove the obstacles at the earliest possible moment.
('59', 337, 2, 9, 602046) Every lawyer to whom I have referred the matter has assured me that even when the trustees and temple goers desire a particular temple to be opened, it cannot be done because of the state of the law.
('59', 337, 2, 10, 602246) So far as the defects in any of the Bills are concerned, they can surely be easily remedied.
('59', 337, 2, 11, 602339) If you have any doubt about the position I have taken up, I would like you, if you at all can, to come over to Yeravda and discuss the position before you differ.
('59', 337, 2, 12, 602502) If, however, you have no doubt whatsoever about your view of the matter, I must not trouble you to come merely for my pleasure.
('59', 337, 3, 13, 602630) Yours sincerely, SJT.

It is not possible to send you proofs before Friday mail, because the last article does not lave me before Thursday evening, and it will be dangerous to send you anything from day to day, because there is no certainty of what I write appearing in the issue for which it is written, nor of its appearing in the form in which it is written in the first instance.

('59', 338, 8, 13, 604120) February 21, 1933
('59', 338, 9, 14, 604138) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter of 15th instant for which I thank you.
('59', 338, 9, 15, 604209) I endeavour to be as precise as I possibly can about anything I write and therefore when I am confronted with anything as having been said by me, in justice to me I should have the very words that I have said.
('59', 338, 9, 16, 604419) You will understand what I mean when I tell you what distinction there is between what you think I have said and what I have actually said.
('59', 338, 9, 17, 604559) I do not consider “the Gita to be the only scripture of
('59', 338, 10, 18, 604615) 1 The addressee wanted to publish a supplement in Tamil and Telugu every Monday containing Gandhiji’s articles in Harijan and had therefore requested for advance proofs which he wanted to reach him on Friday or Saturday.

('59', 339, 1, 2, 604899) unquestionable authority which alone should be our true guide”.
('59', 339, 1, 3, 604963) What I have said and what I still hold is that for me in view of the multitude of books claimed to be scriptural and [of] conflicting texts, Gita is the only safe guide, because it contains the concentrated essence of all that the Hindu scriptures have to teach and that I would unhesitatingly reject anything that is in conflict with the spirit of the Gita.
('59', 339, 1, 4, 605322) Thus I would test the validity of every religious precept or code of conduct on the anvil of that teaching.
('59', 339, 1, 5, 605430) Thus you will see that I exclude nothing.
('59', 339, 1, 6, 605472) I take in all the scriptures, but I use the Gita to unlock their meaning.
('59', 339, 1, 7, 605546) I quite agree with your view of the Samhitas, but my difficulty in applying them to daily conduct arises from the fact that there are conflicting statements in the same Samhita and there is conflict among the different Samhitas.
('59', 339, 1, 8, 605775) There again I summon the Gita to my aid.
('59', 339, 1, 9, 605816) Whilst I agree also that rules of conduct will show variation from the ideal and even between man and man, to be true to the ideal they should conform to it and enable one to make a progressive approach to it.
('59', 339, 1, 10, 606026) They must not take one away progressively further from it.
('59', 339, 1, 11, 606085) Examined thus, untouchability, as it is practised today, in my opinion, is clearly contrary to the Hindu scriptures.
('59', 339, 1, 12, 606202) As I read your several propositions, untouchability stands condemned by them.
('59', 339, 1, 13, 606280) As to the referendum, you have evidently missed the strict limitations placed upon its scope.
('59', 339, 1, 14, 606374) If I had believed that current untouchability had its roots in Hinduism and that untouchables were clearly prohibited from entering temples, there would be no question whatsoever of referendum.
('59', 339, 1, 15, 606568) But since there are two schools of opinion, why should not the people decide to which school they will belong?
('59', 339, 1, 16, 606679) Who will decide for the people whether they should belong to the Shaivite sect or Vaishnavite, if not they themselves?
('59', 339, 1, 17, 606798) Is that not what the Hindus have done all through their great history?

('59', 340, 2, 3, 607140) February 21, 1933
('59', 340, 3, 4, 607158) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter of the 19th instant.
('59', 340, 3, 5, 607220) I can only advise you patiently to follow the columns of Harijan.
('59', 340, 3, 6, 607286) Perchance you will find some answer in them to your questions 1. As you yourself admit in effect that varnashrama is irrelevant to the issue that is agitating the public mind, I must conserve the energy of myself and the public by not saying more than is necessary on varnashrama, not that there is anything to conceal; as a matter of fact, what I may say hereafter can be gleaned by a patient reader from my writings.
('59', 340, 3, 7, 607705) Only I have observed repeatedly that not until a particular question has become a live issue have readers of my writings concentrated upon what I have said upon that issue before it became a live issue.
('59', 340, 3, 8, 607908) You may depend upon it that Dr. Ambedkar himself will not let me off as easily as you will.
('59', 340, 3, 9, 608000) You will perhaps allow yourself to be put off, not Dr. Ambedkar quite so easily.
('59', 340, 3, 10, 608081) Therefore you will please hold yourself in patience.
('59', 340, 4, 11, 608134) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('59', 340, 8, 18, 608405) Moreover, it will also be possible to implement the compromise which I have suggested.

('59', 340, 9, 21, 608720) What about the intermarriage and interdining amongst the four varnas?
('59', 340, 9, 22, 608790) At what age would the varna be determined?
('59', 340, 9, 23, 608833) Who would supervise and be responsible for the maintenance of the order of varnashrama?
('59', 340, 9, 24, 608921) If marriage or dining is immaterial, how would your varnashrama differ from the Western order of society?”

('59', 342, 2, 4, 610565) 1 I could not drive the lesson home unless I drew pointed attention to your mention.
('59', 342, 2, 5, 610650) I have certainly forgotten all about it.
('59', 342, 2, 6, 610691) Will you do likewise?
('59', 342, 2, 7, 610713) Nor must you take to heart Dr. Ambedkar’s explosion 2, the Government’s decision 3, or Malaviyaji’s opposition 4. These are all in the day’s happenings.
('59', 342, 2, 8, 610866) Somehow or other not one of the three things has shaken me, possibly because I was prepared for all the three.
('59', 342, 2, 9, 610977) Our satisfaction must lie in our having done the very best that we are capable of doing.
('59', 342, 2, 10, 611066) You have certainly.

('59', 342, 10, 26, 612176) I know you do not agree with this, but personally I feel that for all practical purposes there is no difference between the circulation and the appointment of a Select Committee.
('59', 342, 10, 27, 612355) Even if a Select Committee is appointed, nothing could be done before the Simla session and even if the Bill is circulated with a specific time limit the Select Committee could be appointed in the Simla session and the Bill may then be taken into consideration.
('59', 342, 10, 28, 612617) Thus in reconciling ourselves to the circulation course, we are not wasting any more time than would be wasted in any case.

('59', 343, 4, 6, 612937) 481. WHY ‘HARIJAN’1
('59', 343, 5, 7, 612957) Many people have asked me why I have used the name ‘Harijans’ for people whom we commit the sin of regarding as untouchables.
('59', 343, 5, 8, 613083) Years ago a Kathiawadi Antyaja had written to me that names like Antyaja, achhoot, asprishya hurt his community.
('59', 343, 5, 9, 613196) I could appreciate their feelings.
('59', 343, 5, 10, 613231) For me they were neither Antyajas nor untouchables.
('59', 343, 5, 11, 613283) It was this correspondent who had pointed out to me that the poet devotee Narasinh Mehta in one of his bhajans had referred to the Antyajas as ‘Harijans’.
('59', 343, 5, 12, 613438) In my view the bhajan he had sent to me to support his contention did not yield the meaning which he thought it did.
('59', 343, 5, 13, 613555) All the same I liked the name ‘Harijan’ immensely.
('59', 343, 5, 14, 613606) ‘Harijan’ means a devotee of God, beloved of God.
('59', 343, 5, 15, 613656) It is God’s promise that He is the Protector of the oppressed, an ocean of compassion, the strength of the weak, the Refuge of the helpless, the Support of the lame and the Eye of the blind.
('59', 343, 5, 16, 613847) One may therefore expect Him to bestow especial grace on the oppressed.
('59', 343, 5, 17, 613919) Looked at from this point of view, I am sure the name ‘Harijan’ is appropriate in every way for the Antyaja brethren.
('59', 343, 5, 18, 614037) Some argue that the Antyajas became untouchables because of their actions in their previous birth.
('59', 343, 5, 19, 614136) Still others say: ‘Let us suppose for a moment that we regard four crores of our brethren as untouchables.
('59', 343, 5, 20, 614243) But what special miseries do they have to suffer that the other crores of people do not?
('59', 343, 5, 21, 614332) The miseries that they suffer because of untouchability must be only mental and there is no remedy for it.
('59', 343, 5, 22, 614439) Being the fruit of a previous birth, it must be regarded as a divine dispensation.
('59', 343, 5, 23, 614522) The privations which the Antyajas suffer because of their poverty and destitute condition are the common lot of all the people of India with the exception of two or three crores of people.
('59', 343, 5, 24, 614711) Why then should not all of them be called Harijans?’ This argument is utterly absurd.
('59', 343, 5, 25, 614797) Untouchability as we observe today is neither the result of actions of previous births nor of God’s making.
('59', 343, 6, 26, 614905) 1 Gandhiji wrote under the same title in the English Harijan, vide “Why ‘Harijan’ ”, “Why Harijan”, 11 2 1933.
('59', 344, 0, 1, 615016) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 345
('59', 344, 1, 2, 615061) untouchability prevalent at the present time is man’s doing.
('59', 344, 1, 3, 615122) The caste Hindus are responsible for it.
('59', 344, 1, 4, 615163) No one can escape the fruit of his action.
('59', 344, 1, 5, 615206) But by accepting the law of karma, we acquire no right to put the blame on others.
('59', 344, 1, 6, 615289) The way of karma is indeed inscrutable.
('59', 344, 1, 7, 615329) No one knows what karma will bear what fruit.
('59', 344, 1, 8, 615375) We are all laden with one or other shortcoming, hence we have no right whatever to judge the shortcomings or sins of others.
('59', 344, 1, 9, 615500) Our right and duty is only to help one another get rid of such shortcomings.
('59', 344, 1, 10, 615577) Compassion is incompa tible with untouchability whether predestined or unavoidable.
('59', 344, 1, 11, 615661) Four crores of Hindus have to face unparalleled hardships because we treat them as untouchables.
('59', 344, 1, 12, 615758) They do not get even food or a place to live in as others do, even though they have the money as well as other means.
('59', 344, 1, 13, 615876) They have no temples, or dharmsalas or hospitals or schools for them as other people have.
('59', 344, 1, 14, 615967) We have crushed them so much that they have almost forgotten that they are human beings.
('59', 344, 1, 15, 616056) These four crore brethren have not even the will to rise from this abject and abominable situation.
('59', 344, 1, 16, 616156) There is no exaggeration in my account of Harijans.
('59', 344, 1, 17, 616208) It may be there in one respect.
('59', 344, 1, 18, 616240) No one knows the exact number of Harijans.
('59', 344, 1, 19, 616283) I have accepted the figure given by Shri Amritlal Thakkar.
('59', 344, 1, 20, 616342) Thakkar Bapa is himself not very sure about the figure After thorough survey all that can be said is that the number of Harijans cannot be more than four crores.
('59', 344, 1, 21, 616504) But irrespective of the fact whether there are four crore Harijans or one, the guilt on the part of the caste Hindus remains the same.
('59', 344, 1, 22, 616639) If there is any fault in my description of Harijans it may be one of understatement and certainly not of exaggeration.
('59', 344, 1, 23, 616758) 1 If this oppressed class were not to have God’s grace or mercy the world would cease to have faith in God.
('59', 344, 1, 24, 616866) The truth is that He exists and He is an ocean of compassion, the Protector of the oppressed, and the Feeder of the hungry.
('59', 344, 1, 25, 616990) Therefore, in India, those who are most unhappy deserve to be called Harijans.
('59', 344, 1, 26, 617069) And it is my firm belief that if we do not remove the untouchability practised against the Harijans and did not treat them as our brethren, Hindu society would perish under their curse.
('59', 344, 1, 27, 617255) As Tulsidas says,
('59', 344, 2, 28, 617273) 1 A Gujarati version of this article which appeared in Harijanbandhu, 12 3 1933, has the following additional sentences: “Whatever I have written can be substantiated.

('59', 345, 4, 6, 617694) February 23, 1933
('59', 345, 5, 7, 617712) MY DEAREST SON, Son you have become of your own choice.
('59', 345, 5, 8, 617768) I have accepted the responsible position.
('59', 345, 5, 9, 617810) And son you shall remain to the end of time.
('59', 345, 5, 10, 617855) The tie between you and me is much thicker and tougher than blood.
('59', 345, 5, 11, 617922) It is the burning love of Truth at any cost.
('59', 345, 5, 12, 617967) Therefore whatever you may do will not disappoint me.
('59', 345, 5, 13, 618021) But I was sad.
('59', 345, 5, 14, 618036) I am not thinking of superiority of celibacy over marriage.
('59', 345, 5, 15, 618096) I am thinking of what you had intended, almost pledged yourself to be.
('59', 345, 5, 16, 618167) But I know that you had to be true to yourself and appear as you were.
('59', 345, 5, 17, 618238) I showed your letter to Jamnalalji and he too felt the same as I did.
('59', 345, 5, 18, 618308) But whilst I was trying to make time to write to you, in came Ala, tears dropping from her eyes.
('59', 345, 5, 19, 618405) She put into my hands your letter and said, “How can I bear this?
('59', 345, 5, 20, 618471) It was agreed between us that we were both to remain single, or if we could not, we were to marry each other.” I consoled her and advised her to send you her blessings.
('59', 345, 5, 21, 618640) I do not know what she has done or written.
('59', 345, 5, 22, 618684) You will tell me what understanding there was between you and her.
('59', 345, 5, 23, 618751) But taking it for granted that your word was never given to Ala as she imagines it was, you and Mary 1 have my blessings.
('59', 345, 5, 24, 618873) I have met her.
('59', 345, 5, 25, 618889) I have a vivid recollection that the innocence of her face stamped itself upon my mind.
('59', 345, 5, 26, 618977) I know that your joint life will be one of complete dedication to service.
('59', 345, 5, 27, 619052) But if there is the slightest possibility of a breach (moral) of word given to Ala, you must both—you and Mary—be prepared to bear what will be the heaviest cross and sacrifice your cherished hope on the altar of Truth which is God.
('59', 345, 5, 28, 619285) If there is a trace of suspicion of breach, you certainly and Mary and Ala—the latter two if they have the same living faith in Truth as I have

('59', 346, 1, 6, 619790) My letter is not satisfactory because it is written in ignorance of facts.
('59', 346, 1, 7, 619865) But it need not be unsatisfactory as being between father and son.
('59', 346, 1, 8, 619932) You can fill in the gaps.
('59', 346, 1, 9, 619958) Of this you have my assurance that whatever you do, I am certain, will have been done out of obedience to Truth as it might reveal itself to you.
('59', 346, 1, 10, 620104) More than that no man can do.
('59', 346, 1, 11, 620134) May God guide you and Mary.

('59', 346, 5, 17, 620355) MY DEAR ELLEN, I was delighted to hear from you.
('59', 346, 5, 18, 620404) I appreciate all your affection.
('59', 346, 5, 19, 620437) I have gone up hills but I have never walked along them all day long but I do know however what you mean by the mountains reaching the horizon.
('59', 346, 5, 20, 620581) The knowledge that I am a guiding varde to some friends humbles me and makes me more and more conscious of the tremendous burden that I carry on my shoulders.
('59', 346, 5, 21, 620740) I have to watch myself and incessantly pray to the God of Truth that I may not prove a false guide to anybody.

('59', 348, 3, 5, 622085) I was delighted to see your old familiar hand but sorry to learn that you had not been keeping well.
('59', 348, 3, 6, 622186) You must not put on fat.
('59', 348, 3, 7, 622211) Though I am a quack, I am a quack who has tried experiments on himself and therefore can speak with some authority.
('59', 348, 3, 8, 622327) You ought to take plenty of exercise.
('59', 348, 3, 9, 622365) Walking is the prince of exercises, and you should give up all prepared fat, such as, oil or ghee, and take as little milk as possible and live on juicy fruit and brown bread without butter.
('59', 348, 3, 10, 622556) In a month’s time you will find yourself a changed man.
('59', 348, 3, 11, 622612) You may take green, non starchy vegetables simply boiled.
('59', 348, 3, 12, 622670) We do not realize how we become prey to disease by criminal ignorance of the right dietary and the absolute necessity of exercises in the fresh air.
('59', 348, 3, 13, 622819) I shall keep a letter with this for Krishna.

('59', 349, 2, 3, 623350) February 23, 1933
('59', 349, 3, 4, 623368) MY DEAR TANGAI1, You have sent me a note not written by you.
('59', 349, 3, 5, 623429) Therefore you cannot complain if I sent you a reply not written by me.
('59', 349, 3, 6, 623500) I know that Uncle Charlie eats much salt, but you must not copy bad habits of elderly people, and eating much salt is a bad habit, and much salt spoils the original flavour of things with which it is mixed.
('59', 349, 3, 7, 623707) Uncle Charlie has also a habit of spoiling little children by giving them too many sweets.
('59', 349, 3, 8, 623798) Therefore, if I were you, I should distribute sweets amongst lots of poorer children and I should feel happy at the thought of sharing with them gifts received from friends.

('59', 350, 2, 3, 624431) February 23, 1933
('59', 350, 3, 4, 624449) MY DEAR MARY, Your Hindi letter is extraordinarily good.
('59', 350, 3, 5, 624506) We all admired your very clear handwriting.
('59', 350, 3, 6, 624550) God has many definitions: as many as there are men and women on this earth.
('59', 350, 3, 7, 624626) are also among them, they may be rendered as Truth, Knowledge and Bliss.
('59', 350, 3, 8, 624699) They are interlaced.
('59', 350, 3, 9, 624720) The selection of morning verses is designed to satisfy all wants.
('59', 350, 3, 10, 624786) Every verse represents a power or powers of God the Infinite and the Indescribable.
('59', 350, 3, 11, 624870) Yes, I had a letter from Verrier.
('59', 350, 3, 12, 624904) It surprised me, it did not disappoint me.
('59', 350, 3, 13, 624947) I believe with Paul that men should marry rather than burn.
('59', 350, 3, 14, 625007) Celibacy is good for those whose mind co operates with the body.
('59', 350, 3, 15, 625072) I do remember Mary Gillett well.
('59', 350, 3, 16, 625105) Her innocent face impressed itself on me the very first time I saw her.
('59', 350, 3, 17, 625177) I am glad you are getting on well there.
('59', 350, 3, 18, 625218) And now you have Duncan Greenlees to care for.
('59', 350, 3, 19, 625265) You will please see to his comforts and know him too.
('59', 350, 4, 20, 625319) BAPU [PS.] You should sleep under the sky and you will feel cool throughout the night.
('59', 350, 4, 21, 625406) I have your letter about Kashmir.
('59', 350, 4, 22, 625440) Of course you should go and stay there till June if the climate agrees and then come down.
('59', 350, 4, 23, 625531) But the duration will depend upon circumstances.

('59', 351, 2, 3, 625721) February 23, 1933
('59', 351, 3, 4, 625739) NARANDAS, I got the large packet of letters sent by you.
('59', 351, 3, 5, 625796) You will find with this a letter 1 for Mary and one for Greenlees.
('59', 351, 3, 6, 625863) Lakshmidas and Anandi have come here.
('59', 351, 3, 7, 625901) Anandi has been having fever and the temperature remains at 99. It even rises by one or two points in the course of the day.
('59', 351, 3, 8, 626026) It does not fall below 99. But I am completely hopeful that we shall be able to cure her fever here.
('59', 351, 3, 9, 626127) For one thing, the climate of the place is excellent.
('59', 351, 3, 10, 626181) When Dudabhai comes there, have a talk with him and come to a definite decision.
('59', 351, 3, 11, 626262) If he agrees, let the marriage take place as soon as possible.
('59', 351, 3, 12, 626325) If he does not give his willing consent, tell him that we shall not be able to look after Lakshmi any longer.
('59', 351, 3, 13, 626435) If your own experience is contrary to my inference and if you feel inclined to let her stay, you may ignore my opinion.
('59', 351, 3, 14, 626555) Impart to Amina as much as you can.
('59', 351, 3, 15, 626591) It would be good if she daily practises the Urdu script.
('59', 351, 3, 16, 626648) What happened about Parvati?
('59', 351, 3, 17, 626677) Is Ranchhodbhai in difficulty about anything?
('59', 351, 3, 18, 626723) I worry about him as I have had no letter from him.
('59', 351, 3, 19, 626775) Parnerkar’s scheme which all of you have approved is an old one, though it is certainly good.
('59', 351, 3, 20, 626869) Ask him to write to me.
('59', 351, 3, 21, 626893) What arrangement do you propose to make for selling milk?
('59', 351, 3, 22, 626951) I follow what you say regarding the land at Bidaj.
('59', 351, 3, 23, 627002) Let me know how you find Duncan.
('59', 351, 3, 24, 627035) If the impression which he has produced on me turns out to be correct, he is likely to prove a fine worker.
('59', 351, 3, 25, 627143) What is the composition of the plaster applied to Kanu?
('59', 351, 3, 26, 627199) By whom was it recommended?
('59', 351, 3, 27, 627227) In all such cases of injury, complete rest for the injured part is the most important thing.
('59', 351, 3, 28, 627320) Some times the injury is to such a part that, in order to give rest to it, it is necessary to rest the whole body.
('59', 351, 3, 29, 627435) But this is the quickest remedy for curing the pain.
('59', 351, 3, 30, 627488) Have a talk with Prabhudas and try to help him to overcome his restlessness.
('59', 351, 3, 31, 627565) If Bhagwanji devotes himself whole heartedly to his new job, he can do excellent work.
('59', 351, 3, 32, 627652) Has Dhiru’s health improved?
('59', 351, 3, 33, 627681) I am not happy that he has stopped writing to me altogether.

('59', 354, 1, 4, 630551) I suppose you know that she is called Mother.
('59', 354, 1, 5, 630597) ‘Gita’ means ‘song’.
('59', 354, 1, 6, 630618) It is used as an adjective applied to Upanishad which is in the feminine gender.
('59', 354, 1, 7, 630699) It has been likened to the sacred cow, the giver of all desires.
('59', 354, 1, 8, 630764) Hence Mother.
('59', 354, 1, 9, 630778) Well, that immortal Mother gives all the milk we need for spiritual sustenance, if we would but approach her as babes seeking and sucking it from her.
('59', 354, 1, 10, 630929) She is capable of yielding milk to her millions of babes from her exhaustless udder.
('59', 354, 1, 11, 631014) In doing the Harijan work in the midst of calumny, misrepresentations and apparent disappointments, her lap comforts me and keeps me from falling into the Slough of Despond.
('59', 354, 1, 12, 631188) So you find me laughing and free from care.
('59', 354, 1, 13, 631232) My weight has become steady at 103 and the diet also the same in quantity and kind.
('59', 354, 1, 14, 631316) For the time being unboiled fresh milk goes on without doing any harm.
('59', 354, 1, 15, 631387) Writing for Harijan occupies most of my time and Mahadev’s.
('59', 354, 1, 16, 631447) Chhaganlal too is kept fairly busy.
('59', 354, 1, 17, 631483) No more this time.
('59', 354, 1, 18, 631502) I must wake up the others for prayer now.
('59', 354, 1, 19, 631544) Love to you and the others from us all.
('59', 354, 2, 20, 631584) BAPU [PS.] I send you by registered book post religious postcards which Princess Aristarchie sends almost every week with carefully selected verses at the back of each.
('59', 354, 2, 21, 631753) Do you know that Verrier intends to marry Mary Gillett in April!
('59', 354, 2, 22, 631818) Mahadev reminds me that I wrote to you last week about Verrier.
('59', 354, 3, 23, 631882) I have just got your letter.
('59', 354, 3, 24, 631911) But no time to deal with it today.

('59', 355, 2, 3, 632126) [February 24, 1933] 1
('59', 355, 3, 4, 632148) MY DEAR CHARLIE, I have your letter.
('59', 355, 3, 5, 632185) You know what is happening to the Bills.
('59', 355, 3, 6, 632226) It is unfortunate and it is bad.
('59', 355, 3, 7, 632259) The Government have taken up, in my opinion, not an attitude of neutrality but one of partiality.
('59', 355, 3, 8, 632357) I do not know if you have caught the central point of my argument.
('59', 355, 3, 9, 632424) It would be partiality to the reformers and would also be interference with religion if the Government gave facilities for the consideration of a measure compelling temple entry.
('59', 355, 3, 10, 632603) It is partiality to orthodoxy in that the Government will not remove the legal bar to temple entry created by decisions of courts of law, decisions not based on statutory law but on religious usage, thus making untouchability a crime as if it was part of the Penal Code.
('59', 355, 3, 11, 632874) The Government to be neutral should lift this bar and say to either party.
('59', 355, 3, 12, 632949) ‘We cannot take sides in religious matters.
('59', 355, 3, 13, 632993) Untouchability may be for some of you a breach of your religion, but there is no breach in it of common law and therefore there can be no punishment under the common law.’ There are innumerable religious practices in Hinduism not even [as] offensive to the moral sense of the world as untouchability undoubtedly is, and yet their breach is not penal under the common law.
('59', 355, 3, 14, 633365) All that the reformers want is opportunity for progress, opportunity for converting public opinion, and when and where it is converted, opportunity for giving effect to that conversion.
('59', 355, 3, 15, 633551) Today even if cent per cent of Hindus entitled to worship in a particular temple desired the admission of Harijans to that temple, they could not carry out their wish because of the decisions I have referred to.
('59', 355, 3, 16, 633763) The two Bills are designed to remove this anomaly.
('59', 355, 3, 17, 633814) I watch, wait and pray.

('59', 356, 2, 3, 634065) February 24, 1933
('59', 356, 3, 4, 634083) MY DEAR GANESAN, I have your letter of 20th instant, but as I have anticipated you and told you that advance copies 1 can be sent to you on Fridays and not before, 2 I need not say anything more.
('59', 356, 3, 5, 634279) Mahadev just reminds me that sending you copies on Fridays gives you no advantage because Madras copies are all sent on Fridays.
('59', 356, 3, 6, 634408) My previous letter tells you how utterly impossible it is to send you anything earlier.
('59', 356, 3, 7, 634496) I return the letter from Dr. Rajan.
('59', 356, 4, 8, 634532) Yours sincerely,

('59', 356, 7, 11, 634614) February 24, 1933
('59', 356, 8, 12, 634632) I had your telegram 3 asking me whether you could release the correspondence for publication.
('59', 356, 8, 13, 634726) As I had done so 48 hours before the receipt of your telegram I did not send a wire in reply, thinking that you must already have seen the notice of the publication 4. Since then I had no time to dictate a reply to you, as Harijan takes up practically all my time up to Thursday evening.
('59', 356, 8, 14, 635014) I hope you are getting regularly your copy of the Harijan.
('59', 356, 8, 15, 635073) I do not know whether you at all get the time to look at it.
('59', 356, 8, 16, 635134) Now that the world knows the difference of outlook between you and me as to these Bills, I would like you to review the whole position in the light of what you yourself have suggested.
('59', 356, 8, 17, 635319) You say that it is possible by discussion between sanatanists and reformers to arrive at a compromise without the aid of legislation.
('59', 356, 8, 18, 635453) I taxed myself as to how this could be, even assuming that there was

('59', 357, 1, 2, 635699) complete agreement between sanatanists and reformers that public temples should be thrown open to Harijans.
('59', 357, 1, 3, 635807) Even that agreement cannot supersede the law which lays down that Harijans cannot enter public temples.
('59', 357, 1, 4, 635911) I therefore cannot get away from the very real moral difficulty that unless we get the law altered, we are not in a position to keep the pledge given in the Bombay Resolution.
('59', 357, 1, 5, 636087) We cannot plead helplessness under cover of this law, of which I knew nothing at the time I drew up the Resolution about temples.
('59', 357, 1, 6, 636217) I suppose that you do know that the original draft was prepared by me.
('59', 357, 1, 7, 636288) True, several changes were made after, but no change was made so as to alter the substance of my draft.
('59', 357, 1, 8, 636392) I wish therefore that for the sake of the very religion which you and I hold dearer than life itself, you will examine the moral difficulties I have presented here.
('59', 357, 1, 9, 636557) And let me repeat, if it is at all necessary, what I have said in my article in Harijan that this latestdifference in viewpoint between you and me does not, in the slightest degree, diminish my regard or affection for you.

('59', 357, 5, 13, 636852) February 24, 1933
('59', 357, 6, 14, 636870) MY DEAR DEVI, I was glad to have your letter.
('59', 357, 6, 15, 636916) I see you are now doing lighter work.
('59', 357, 6, 16, 636954) The change was certainly necessary for you and I hope that it has benefited you.
('59', 357, 6, 17, 637035) Of course we have cold here, but in this part of India cold weather is very nice and pleasant, not at all severe, but it is very severe in the Punjab, though it is very bracing.
('59', 357, 6, 18, 637213) I think I did meet Dr. and Mrs. Gray whilst I was there.
('59', 357, 6, 19, 637270) You should give me news of Albert whenever you have any, because I do not hear from him at all.
('59', 357, 6, 20, 637366) I have written to him.
('59', 357, 6, 21, 637389) Devdas is in Delhi doing Harijan work.
('59', 357, 6, 22, 637428) Ramdas is in the same prison, but not in the same yard.
('59', 357, 6, 23, 637484) I am permitted to see him occasionally.
('59', 357, 6, 24, 637524) Mahadev is of course with me and doing quite well.
('59', 357, 6, 25, 637575) Ba and Mira are together in the Sabarmati prison, and so far as I am aware, they are keeping well.

('59', 358, 1, 5, 637957) The whole of my time is occupied with that work just now.
('59', 358, 1, 6, 638015) I am not writing to Muriel 1 this week.
('59', 358, 1, 7, 638055) Please give my love to her and all the dear friends of Kingsley Hall and the School House.

('59', 358, 6, 13, 638299) I prize your love.
('59', 358, 6, 14, 638318) Of course I was not angry with you and therefore there is nothing to forgive.
('59', 358, 6, 15, 638396) On the contrary, it is a matter of joy to me that I have friends to whom I can write without reserve and without any fear of being misunder stood.
('59', 358, 6, 16, 638543) However, I am glad that you have resolved upon not spending money on love cables.
('59', 358, 6, 17, 638625) Love need not express itself in words, but if it must, love letters ought to be quite enough.
('59', 358, 6, 18, 638719) Immediately we realize that we have nothing of our own, that all we have is held in trust for those in greater need, we have to spend it like misers.

('59', 359, 6, 14, 639827) She further tells me that latterly you have not felt quite happy about her.
('59', 359, 6, 15, 639903) Please tell me quite frankly all you know about her or may have against her.

('59', 359, 11, 22, 640190) You can do khadi work most decidedly, and you can also meet the orthodox people and discuss with them the whole question of the service of Harijans.
('59', 359, 11, 23, 640339) Though orthodoxy is well entrenched in Cochin, you will have no difficulty in approaching the orthodox people, and then of course there is a large Gujarati colony in Cochin.
('59', 359, 11, 24, 640513) You should meet them.
('59', 359, 11, 25, 640535) Lastly, you should secure subscribers for the Harijan among the very large number of English speaking Cochinites.

('59', 361, 3, 5, 642141) It was from her own letter that I learnt how she regarded you as her all in all.
('59', 361, 3, 6, 642222) As I heard certain allegations against her while our correspondence was going on, I wrote to her about them immediately and suggested that she should come and see me.
('59', 361, 3, 7, 642389) She did so immediately.
('59', 361, 3, 8, 642413) It appears from our conversation that the allegations against her may be baseless.
('59', 361, 3, 9, 642496) I have been guiding her to an extent, but I think it to be my duty to ascertain your wish before I give her any positive advice.
('59', 361, 3, 10, 642625) Hence this letter.
('59', 361, 3, 11, 642644) I have written it with her knowledge.
('59', 361, 3, 12, 642682) She will remain here till your reply is received.
('59', 361, 3, 13, 642732) I request you to have no hesitation in making any suggestion you wish to do.

('59', 361, 7, 18, 642965) 1 How is that?
('59', 361, 7, 19, 642980) If you have faith in me, you can have no reason to be restless.
('59', 361, 7, 20, 643044) You must joyously do what you are asked.
('59', 361, 7, 21, 643085) Have you heard or sung the bhajan: “I will dance singing praises of the Lord”?
('59', 361, 7, 22, 643164) Devotion to duty is singing praises of the Lord.

('59', 362, 4, 7, 644217) 509. HIGHER EDUCATION FOR HARIJANS
('59', 362, 5, 8, 644252) I hope all those who are interested in the removal of untouchability are familiar with Mr. David’s scheme for the higher education of selected Harijans by caste Hindus.
('59', 362, 5, 9, 644421) The scheme was published some time ago in the Bombay Press after being enthusiastically accepted by the Servants of Untouchables Society.
('59', 362, 5, 10, 644559) In Mr. David’s words, “It aims at enabling a large number of untouchables to enjoy the benefits of the best higher education (including technical instruction) possible in this country.” Under it, “well to do caste Hindus are expected throughout India each to bear the expenses for such education of at least one Harijan student for a period of five years.
('59', 362, 5, 11, 644915) Scholarships should be given to selected candidates and the expenses imply the provision of educational fees, books and living expenses on a modest scale”.
('59', 362, 5, 12, 645071) Mr. David thinks that Rs. 500 per year per Harijan would be required for college education and half as much for high school education.
('59', 362, 5, 13, 645206) He advises donors to subscribe, wherever it is possible, the whole amount covering five years in one lump sum.
('59', 362, 5, 14, 645317) “In order to build up the self respect of Harijan scholars”, says Mr. David, “it should be laid down that each scholar would be expected to reimburse the amount originally advanced for his education as soon as he is in a position to do so.
('59', 362, 5, 15, 645557) Thus a student under this scheme is provided by means of a loan and not a gift.” And if a large number of students discharge these debts of honour, Mr. David anticipates that a permanent fund will be created.
('59', 362, 5, 16, 645766) Mr. David advises the formation of a committee or committees in Provinces which will frame rules for the selection of candidates, and the disbursements of subscriptions will be subject to the recommendation of such committee or committees.
('59', 362, 5, 17, 646006) He is emphatic that the scheme, if carried out, should “produce important and sustained results”, and make possible within a comparatively short
('59', 363, 0, 1, 646151) 364 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 363, 1, 2, 646193) period the creation of a large number of lawyers, teachers, doctors and engineers from among Harijans.
('59', 363, 1, 3, 646296) The existence of a considerable number of such persons would be of material help in raising the social status of the depressed classes, and, he adds, “it is framed on strictly non controversial lines, thus widening to the maximum its potential field of response.
('59', 363, 1, 4, 646559) It should win the support of even the staunchest sanatanists.
('59', 363, 1, 5, 646621) It is an opportunity at hand for caste Hindus to give concrete expression of their feeling towards untouchables.” Let me hope, with Mr. David, that the scheme will commend itself to the “staunchest sanatanists” and that in any case it would receive liberal support.
('59', 363, 1, 6, 646887) I do not know whether the Central Board or the Bombay Board has received any donations.
('59', 363, 1, 7, 646975) I venture to suggest to the Bombay Board that, if it has not already done so, it should form a small committee getting, if possible, a sanatanist to work on it, frame rules and get scholarships.
('59', 363, 1, 8, 647170) Whilst it would be the most proper thing to get 1,000 donors who would contribute Rs. 2,500 or 1,250, as the case may be, for full five years’ expenses, it is not necessary to confine oneself to the letter of Mr. David’s scheme, so long as its spirit is observed.
('59', 363, 1, 9, 647434) The central point of the scheme is that there should be a decent fund at once collected from caste Hindus for the higher education of a select number of Harijan boys or girls.
('59', 363, 1, 10, 647610) I, therefore, invite subscriptions for the scheme.
('59', 363, 1, 11, 647661) They will be duly acknowledged in these columns.
('59', 363, 1, 12, 647710) Donors should send moneys to the Manager, Sjt.
('59', 363, 1, 13, 647757) A. V. Patwardhan, marking the envelopes ‘the David Scheme’.
('59', 363, 1, 14, 647817) Acknowledgements will be published from week to week, and the money will be handed to the Central Board for their disposal strictly in accordance with the donor’s instructions.
('59', 363, 1, 15, 647994) As soon as the first full subscription is received, I would advise the Central Board to make its selection.
('59', 363, 1, 16, 648102) Donors may make their own choice of the Province from which Harijan boys or girls may be selected, or they may even make their own selection of such boy or girl and hand the donation to the Central Board or Provincial Board for disbursement to, and supervision of, the candidate so selected.

('59', 364, 2, 4, 648497) As the public know, I have been in communication with Dr. Sapru and Sjt.
('59', 364, 2, 5, 648570) Jayakar over the two Bills which have stirred Hindu opinion.
('59', 364, 2, 6, 648631) Jayakar’s opinion I have already published.
('59', 364, 2, 7, 648675) Dr. Sapru’s opinion is now before me on both the Bills.
('59', 364, 2, 8, 648731) In his letter of the 11th instant on the first Bill, he says: 1
('59', 364, 3, 9, 648795) Whatever may be my own personal views, there is no doubt that some eminent Judges (Hindus included) in Madras, Bombay and elsewhere have interpreted the law in such a way that you cannot throw open the temples everywhere to Hindus of the depressed classes except by an Act of the Legislature.
('59', 364, 3, 10, 649088) Now coming to the Bill itself.
('59', 364, 4, 11, 649119) I am afraid the forces of orthodoxy are strong in the Assembly and I am more than doubtful whether the reformers will carry the day.
('59', 364, 4, 12, 649252) I should not, however, feel surprised if dilatory tactics are adopted and the motion to circulate the Bill is carried.
('59', 364, 4, 13, 649371) Framed as the Bill is, I should strongly oppose the motion to circulate the Bill and should enlist the sympathy and support of the members of the Legislature to go ahead with the consideration of the Bill.
('59', 364, 4, 14, 649577) I appreciate the moderation of the Bill, though, speaking for myself, I should not hesitate to go much further than the Bill.
('59', 364, 4, 15, 649703) In my individual capacity I can be of very little use, so far as the Assembly is concerned, but I can assure you of my support, even though I feel that the Bill is a very mild measure.
('59', 364, 5, 16, 649888) On this I telegraphed for his opinion also on the shorter Bill of the two.
('59', 364, 5, 17, 649963) His reply dated 18th instant (omitting the immaterial or personal matters) is as follows: 3
('59', 364, 6, 18, 650055) As I read this clause, it seeks to remove disabilities from which the untouchables are suffering under the existing law, but it does notseek to impose any disability on caste Hindus.
('59', 364, 6, 19, 650238) So far as the latter are concerned, there does not seem to me to be anything like an element of compulsion contemplated by the Bill.
('59', 364, 6, 20, 650371) If they do not wish to associate with the untouchables in the temples, they are not, by this Bill, compelled to do so.
('59', 364, 6, 21, 650490) All that it requires them to do is that they must not stand in the way of the untouchables.
('59', 364, 6, 22, 650582) It also lays down a rule of law for the courts which are required

('59', 365, 1, 7, 651258) Left to myself, I should be prepared to go much further and I have not the same horror of compulsion in a matter of this character as some others have.

('59', 365, 4, 11, 651550) Pandit Pareshnath Bhattacharya, M. A., Vedantaratna, writes from Cooch Behar under date 15th February, 1933: 2
('59', 365, 5, 12, 651661) .I beg to note down in brief outlines the chief points and principles on which I have failed to concur with you.
('59', 365, 5, 13, 651774) (1) You are reported to have said to the effect that the Gita is the only
('59', 365, 6, 14, 651848) scripture of unquestionable authority which alone should be our true guide in matters social, religious and spiritual.
('59', 365, 6, 15, 651967) (2) The sources of Hindu religion are enumerated in the first chapter of the Manusamhita.
('59', 365, 6, 16, 652057) There is no valid reason for its rejection on the mere
('59', 365, 7, 17, 652112) suspicion of interpolations.
('59', 365, 7, 18, 652141) (3) Scriptures are clearly distinguishable into two classes: (a) those dealing with high principles of philosophy and directions for spiritual advancement, (b) and others laying down laws for social discipline and prescribing penalties for lapses and crime.
('59', 365, 7, 19, 652399) (4) In dealing with society and socio religious institutions, we must recognize and abide by the authority of the Samhitas .
('59', 365, 8, 20, 652524) (5) The noble ideal of Vedantic Monism, Pantheism or Panatheism has no application to the problems of social organization or reform, for the simple reason that a whole people can never soar to that height.
('59', 365, 8, 21, 652730) (6) Humanism is admittedly the highest form of religious idealism, but for all practical purposes it must remain the private property of the saints and

('59', 366, 1, 2, 653109) siddha purushas.
('59', 366, 1, 3, 653126) There are inequalities in the society, both in natural
('59', 366, 2, 4, 653181) endowments and personal habits.
('59', 366, 2, 5, 653213) No amount of love or legislative efforts will do away with these inequalities between man and man.
('59', 366, 3, 6, 653312) (7) According to the abstract theory of justice, we cannot condone invidious distinction between man and man for the mere accident of birth or the mistaken choice of profession.
('59', 366, 3, 7, 653490) But in dealing with men, we must face the stern reality and admit the necessity of differential treatment between different castes and classes of people.
('59', 366, 4, 8, 653644) (8) The Hindu law makers were not insensible to the theoretical rights of men, nor were they actuated by the pride of caste or racial hatred.
('59', 366, 5, 9, 653786) (9) According to the Shastras, a sannyasin has no caste.
('59', 366, 5, 10, 653843) Likewise in practice, a truly pious man is always revered irrespective of his caste.
('59', 366, 5, 11, 653928) This shows the true spirit of Hindu religion.
('59', 366, 6, 12, 653974) (10) Religious reform cannot be enforced on the results of referendum.
('59', 366, 6, 13, 654045) For religion, unlike politics, is always cherished by a small minority and it is always for these few to guide, and for the majority to follow.
('59', 366, 6, 14, 654189) Religion cannot be democratised with impunity.
('59', 366, 7, 15, 654236) With these observations, I beg to request you to reconsider the position
('59', 366, 8, 16, 654309) which you have taken up with regard to the temple entry question, and if it is
('59', 366, 9, 17, 654388) not possible, to convince the orthodox people who are always open to
('59', 366, 10, 18, 654457) conviction.
('59', 366, 10, 19, 654469) It would have been much better if the Pandit had quoted my very words about the Gita, as he would at once have seen the difference between what I am reported to have said and what I have actually written.
('59', 366, 10, 20, 654674) This is what I wrote in my statement dated 4th November last:
('59', 366, 11, 21, 654736) It is the one open book to every Hindu who will care to study it, and if
('59', 366, 12, 22, 654809) all the other scriptures were reduced to ashes, the seven hundred verses of this
('59', 366, 13, 23, 654890) imperishable booklet are quite enough to tell one what Hinduism is and how
('59', 366, 14, 24, 654965) one can live up to it.
('59', 366, 14, 25, 654988) And I claim to be a sanatanist because for forty years I
('59', 366, 15, 26, 655045) have been seeking literally to live up to the teachings of that book.
('59', 366, 15, 27, 655115) Whatever
('59', 366, 16, 28, 655124) is contrary to its main theme I reject as un Aindu.
('59', 366, 16, 29, 655176) It excludes no faith and no
('59', 366, 17, 30, 655204) teacher.
('59', 366, 17, 31, 655213) The Pandit and the reader will see that there is a very wide difference between what I have actually said and what is attributed to me, and, that being the case, the grounds for showing the untenability of a position I have never taken up become irrelevant.
('59', 367, 0, 1, 655471) 368 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 367, 1, 2, 655513) Similarly with reference to the Code of Manu, I never rejected the whole of it on “the mere suspicion of interpolation”; and as to interpolations, they are more than a suspicion, for what I consider as interpolations are clearly in contravention of the fundamentals laid down in the Gita and, for that matter, in Manu’s Code itself.
('59', 367, 1, 3, 655846) The following is Manu’s touchstone of religion:
('59', 367, 2, 4, 655894) : : : |
('59', 367, 4, 5, 655902) Whatever is always followed by the learned, the good and those who are free from anger and attachment and whatever is experienced in the heart, know that to be religion.
('59', 367, 5, 6, 656072) Another text is, again, from the same Code:
('59', 367, 8, 7, 656116) Steadfastness, forgiveness, restraint, non stealing, purity, control of the senses, intelligence, learning, truth, freedom from anger, these ten are the touchstone of religion.
('59', 367, 9, 8, 656293) Accordingly, whatever is clearly contrary to this touchstone must be rejected as an interpolation.
('59', 367, 9, 9, 656392) The Pandit has summarilÁŸy dismissed the ideals of Hinduism about equality and justice, by regardiÁfng them as the private property of the saints, forgetting that ideals and saints become perfectly useless if the practice of the poor sinners can never approach the ideals and their repositories, the saints.
('59', 367, 9, 10, 656700) What is that justice “which will not condone invidious distinction between man and man but will make us face the stern reality and admit the necessity of differential treatment between different castes and classes of people”?
('59', 367, 9, 11, 656926) Who are the different castes and what is the differential treatment between them?
('59', 367, 9, 12, 657008) For instance, among the Banias, whom I should know best, there are about 50 castes.
('59', 367, 9, 13, 657092) I know of no differential treatment between them.
('59', 367, 9, 14, 657142) Nor do I find any authority for the formation of these castes in the Smritis.
('59', 367, 9, 15, 657220) There are as many castes among the Brahmins as there are leaves in the little tree under which I am sitting, but I do not find any Smriti which enumerates these castes and the differential treatment.

('59', 368, 1, 2, 657501) have a shrewd suspicion that these gentlemen will fight to the last ditch any attempt made to mete out differential treatment to them, and some of them may even, like my non Brahmin friends, consign to the flames Sanskrit verses printed and stitched together and passed off as divinely inspired Smritis.
('59', 368, 1, 3, 657805) The Pandit says:
('59', 368, 2, 4, 657822) The best way, therefore, of rising superior to the stigma of social inferiority is not enfranchisement, but emancipation from the snare of the dark forces of Nature.
('59', 368, 2, 5, 657988) Who is to be emancipated from the snare of the dark forces of Nature?
('59', 368, 2, 6, 658058) Evidently the Pandit means that it is not the Brahmin who has to emancipate himself from the snare of superiority, but the poor Harijan has to disengage himself from the snare of inferiority.
('59', 368, 2, 7, 658250) Unfortunately, that is precisely what the modern sanatanist Brahmin is resisting, and that is precisely what Dr. Ambedkar demands almost at the point of the bayonet.
('59', 368, 2, 8, 658416) For, he says, ‘the dark forces of Nature shall no longer hold me in their snare.
('59', 368, 2, 9, 658497) I shall rise to the same height that the Brahmin occupies, even though I may have to demolish both him and myself in the attempt.,’ Yet that is the net result of the Pandit’s prescription.
('59', 368, 2, 10, 658686) As against the Pandit’s, my humble prescription is that it is the Brahmin whose privilege and duty it is to disentangle himself from the snare of superiority and himself become a ‘Harijan’ man of God,.
('59', 368, 2, 11, 658888) Then only will he vindicate the glory of varnadharma and the true message of Hinduism, for which he is supposed ‘‘to live, move and have his being”.
('59', 368, 2, 12, 659037) I invite the Pandit to appreciate this very simple prescription.
('59', 368, 2, 13, 659102) Lastly, he has done himself and me less than justice by misreading the scope of the referendum suggested by me.
('59', 368, 2, 14, 659214) Surely, worshippers in a temple have at any time the right to admit others to worship with them on the same terms as they themselves do, so long as they do not interfere with the ceremonial or the mode of worship, which undoubtedly can only be regulated by experience.
('59', 368, 2, 15, 659483) Let us know this ancient practice by its own ancient name, and perhaps it will cease to frighten the Pandit, and other orthodox friends.
('59', 368, 2, 16, 659620) Have not Mahajans always decided matters of admission to temples?
('59', 368, 2, 17, 659686) And Mahajans are assemblies of men and they decide by putting their heads together and taking the sense of the meeting.
('59', 368, 2, 18, 659806) I presume that this would be described as a referendum in the English language.
('59', 368, 2, 19, 659886) I have suggested nothing more and nothing less than this.

('59', 369, 2, 8, 660263) The reply wire was as characteristic as the letter.
('59', 369, 3, 9, 660315) Firstly inappropriate to Harijan, secondly, offensive to partisans.
('59', 369, 4, 10, 660383) Ill requital for your steadfast affection.
('59', 369, 4, 11, 660426) However if perchance useful please publish.
('59', 369, 4, 12, 660470) And here is the letter:
('59', 369, 5, 13, 660494) Private
('59', 369, 6, 14, 660502) SVAGATAM,MYLAPORE, February 13, 1933
('59', 369, 7, 15, 660539) DEAR BROTHER,
('59', 369, 8, 16, 660553) Thanks for your affectionate letter, in which you ask for a message to your new baby.
('59', 369, 9, 17, 660639) I am going to change towards you.
('59', 369, 9, 18, 660673) It is necessary in your interest, no matter what effort it costs me.
('59', 369, 10, 19, 660742) You live in a difficult world.
('59', 369, 10, 20, 660773) Waking or dreaming, you are racked by
('59', 369, 11, 21, 660811) thoughts of sin and penance, confessions and truth quests, satyagraha and
('59', 369, 12, 22, 660885) moral self flagellation.
('59', 369, 12, 23, 660910) Those that talk to you or correspond with you
('59', 369, 13, 24, 660956) continually pose doubts and serious problems, only deepening the grimness
('59', 369, 14, 25, 661030) and suffocation around you.
('59', 369, 14, 26, 661058) Few bring lightness of talk, familiar expletives,
('59', 369, 15, 27, 661108) innocent jokes, revealing banter.
('59', 369, 15, 28, 661142) You badly need a privileged jester in your
('59', 369, 16, 29, 661185) establishment.
('59', 369, 16, 30, 661200) Have you read a story called Ardath by Ouida?
('59', 369, 16, 31, 661246) The hero there
('59', 369, 17, 32, 661261) has a critic whose business is to expose his errors and bring to light the flaws
('59', 369, 18, 33, 661342) in his character.
('59', 369, 18, 34, 661360) Being a professional fault finder, he overdoes his part in the
('59', 369, 19, 35, 661423) end and defeats his first object.
('59', 369, 19, 36, 661457) I shall vary my function from time to time and
('59', 369, 20, 37, 661504) disappear from the scene every now and then.
('59', 369, 20, 38, 661549) But I will endeavour to awaken
('59', 369, 21, 39, 661580) parts of your mind long gone to sleep and to supply elements of nourishment
('59', 369, 22, 40, 661656) which it has long been without.
('59', 369, 22, 41, 661688) Of course, you can stop the medicine if it
('59', 369, 23, 42, 661731) disagrees and you cannot stand it.
('59', 369, 23, 43, 661766) That would be a sign to me that the disease
('59', 369, 24, 44, 661810) had gone too far.
('59', 369, 25, 45, 661828) You are an extraordinarily correct writer of English.
('59', 369, 25, 46, 661882) The ordinary reader will not detect any slips on your part.
('59', 369, 25, 47, 661942) They are not only rare but of a subtle nature.
('59', 369, 25, 48, 661989) The eye of a schoolmaster, made acute by dwelling on trivialities of
('59', 370, 0, 1, 662058) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 371
('59', 370, 1, 2, 662103) grammar, can alone see them.
('59', 370, 1, 3, 662132) Here are some, all from the first number of the Harijan and from the parts bearing your name.
('59', 370, 2, 4, 662226) Page 3. “If it is a bye product of the caste system, it is only in the same sense that an ugly growth is of a body”.
('59', 370, 2, 5, 662343) (‘That’ is fast undergoing a change in English, but this use is far in excess of present usage.
('59', 370, 2, 6, 662439) Better say ‘in which
('59', 370, 3, 7, 662460) an ugly growth is a bye product of a body’.) Also read the whole passage again.
('59', 370, 3, 8, 662540) Don’t you say in effect ‘if the caste system is a bye product of the caste system’?
('59', 370, 3, 9, 662624) Page 3. “The outcaste ness, in the sense we understand it, has therefore to be destroyed altogether.” (A slip similar to the above.
('59', 370, 3, 10, 662756) Between ‘sense’ and ‘we’ insert ‘in which’.) Page 4. “Caste Hindus have to open their temples to Harijans, precisely on the same terms as the other Hindus.,, (Say ‘the same terms as to the other Hindus’.
('59', 370, 3, 11, 662960) Else, it would mean that the other Hindus opened their temples on certain terms to Harijans.) 1
('59', 370, 4, 12, 663056) Page 7. “Beyond this I may not go, for the reason I have already stated and which the reader should respect.” (Insert ‘which’ after ‘reason’.
('59', 370, 4, 13, 663198) The conjunction ‘and’ must not be made to connect a suppressed ‘which’ and an expressed ‘which’.)
('59', 370, 5, 14, 663296) Page 8. “Untouchability has a great deal to answer for the insanitation
('59', 370, 6, 15, 663368) of our streets and our latrines.” (Idiomatically, ‘for’ is part of the verb
('59', 370, 7, 16, 663444) ‘answer’, and cannot govern ‘the insanitation’.
('59', 370, 7, 17, 663492) We must insert ‘in’ after ‘for’,
('59', 370, 8, 18, 663525) though the sentence becomes inelegant.
('59', 370, 8, 19, 663564) I would recast it: ‘Untouchability is
('59', 370, 9, 20, 663602) answerable for a great deal of the insanitation etc.’).
('59', 370, 10, 21, 663658) Page 8. “Therefore, a person who is to attend to scavenging, whether it
('59', 370, 11, 22, 663730) is a paid Bhangi or an unpaid mother, they are unclean until they have washed
('59', 370, 12, 23, 663808) themselves clean of their unclean work.” (The looseness is, perhaps, the result of rapid dictation unchecked by subsequent reading.
('59', 370, 12, 24, 663940) ‘A person’ is left hanging in the air.
('59', 370, 12, 25, 663979) The plurals ‘they’, ‘themselves’ and ‘their’ are justified by the common gender required.
('59', 370, 12, 26, 664069) Still the discord of number is apparent to the point of harshness and may be avoided.
('59', 370, 12, 27, 664155) Read ‘A person .
('59', 370, 12, 28, 664172) is unclean until washed clean of the unclean work.’) Let me add a criticism of substance.
('59', 370, 12, 29, 664262) On page 7 you answer a question under the heading “Seeking or Giving?”.
('59', 370, 12, 30, 664334) The paragraph has gained brevity at the expense of clearness.
('59', 370, 12, 31, 664396) The difference between giving co operation and seeking it requires more elucidation.
('59', 370, 12, 32, 664481) Likewise the analogy of love leading to feeding in one case and starving in another.
('59', 370, 12, 33, 664566) But you are obscure and even baffling when you say that your policy of non co operation with Government
('59', 370, 13, 34, 664670) 1 This correction has been made in the text at p.
('59', 371, 0, 1, 664720) 372 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 371, 1, 2, 664762) allows of your seeking its co operation when ever your purpose is, in your opinion, ‘very sacred and altogether good’.
('59', 371, 1, 3, 664881) Most sensible people follow this rule in ordinary life, not seeking co operation when they don’t care and seeking it when they care.
('59', 371, 1, 4, 665014) They don’t proclaim it as a policy or give it a grand name.
('59', 371, 2, 5, 665074) Ever yours affectionately,
('59', 371, 3, 6, 665101) V. S. SRINIVASAN I wanted to share this letter with the public, because such a letter would help any publicist and his cause and that in an unexpected manner, more so when written without any thought of publication.
('59', 371, 3, 7, 665317) I want also to use the publication of the letter for easing the tension between sanatanists and reformers.
('59', 371, 3, 8, 665424) Let them learn that closest friendships can subsist between persons of contrary temperaments.
('59', 371, 3, 9, 665518) As the public know, Sastri and I have opposite views on many important questions.
('59', 371, 3, 10, 665600) our mutual regard and affection have never suffered on that account.
('59', 371, 3, 11, 665669) There is no reason whatsoever why the same rule cannot be extended to parties and groups representing opposite schools of opinion.
('59', 371, 3, 12, 665800) The sanatanists are out to defend religion as they believe it.
('59', 371, 3, 13, 665863) I take their claim at its face value and deal with it as such.
('59', 371, 3, 14, 665926) Why need they impute to me political motives when I solemnly assert that for me, too, the question of untouchability is a matter purely of religion?
('59', 371, 3, 15, 666075) Would that the affection subsisting between Sastri and me prove so deep and extensive as to reach and affect the whole society !
('59', 371, 3, 16, 666204) But enough of this.
('59', 371, 3, 17, 666224) I almost hear Sastri’s spirit whispering to me: ‘You are misusing the medicine I prescribed to wean you from your disease of grimness and the like., Therefore, let me hasten to tell him and the public that I have in my little camp of privileged jester in Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
('59', 371, 3, 18, 666505) He succeeds in bending me almost double every day with laughter over his unexpected sallies.
('59', 371, 3, 19, 666598) Gloom hides her fiendish face in his presence.
('59', 371, 3, 20, 666645) No disappointment, however great, can make him gloomy for long.
('59', 371, 3, 21, 666709) And he will not let me be serious for two consecutive minutes.
('59', 371, 3, 22, 666772) He will not spare even my ‘saintliness’!
('59', 371, 3, 23, 666813) It may deceive simple people but never the Sardar or the sanatanists.
('59', 371, 3, 24, 666883) Both tear down the mask and compel me to see myself as they delight to see me.
('59', 371, 3, 25, 666962) To be just to the sanatanists, let me admit that Vallabhbhai does not see me quite as sanatanists do.
('59', 371, 3, 26, 667064) But that is beside the point.
('59', 371, 3, 27, 667094) The thing that Sastri wants in our little family is there cent per cent.
('59', 371, 3, 28, 667167) Next time he enters the Assembly or some such place, he must vote special thanks to the Government for putting Vallabhbhai with me or
('59', 372, 0, 1, 667301) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 373
('59', 372, 1, 2, 667346) me with him.
('59', 372, 1, 3, 667359) But this consoling information does not it any way release Sastri from his self imposed obligation.
('59', 372, 1, 4, 667459) For the Sardar will not do what Sastri can be trusted to do mostly.
('59', 372, 1, 5, 667527) Unlike him, the Sardar has the wretched habit in the end of saying ‘ditto’ to all I say.
('59', 372, 1, 6, 667616) And that is bad for anybody.
('59', 372, 1, 7, 667645) Let the student note in passing Sastri’s love for the language he has mastered as few men have done.
('59', 372, 1, 8, 667746) He is a purist in everything.
('59', 372, 1, 9, 667776) We badly need purists in our counry.
('59', 372, 1, 10, 667813) I want only purists as fellow workers in this glorious compaign of abolition of untouchability.
('59', 372, 1, 11, 667909) As to the purity of the language of Harijan, whatever faults are found notwithstanding Sastri’s warning will be shared with me by Shastri, the Editor, and by Mahadev Desai, who shares with the schoolmaster the weakness for writing correctly in the language which for the moment he is using.
('59', 372, 1, 12, 668200) I must leave the reader to find out for himself or herself the many other beauties of Sastri’s letter.
('59', 372, 1, 13, 668303) If he will do so, he must read the letter three or four times and look up all the references in the first issue of Harijan.

('59', 372, 3, 15, 668446) 513. A CAMPAIGN OF ABUSE
('59', 372, 4, 16, 668471) Correspondents have been sending me cuttings from sanatanist newspapers containing distortions of conversations with me and attributing to me things I have never said.
('59', 372, 4, 17, 668639) There is a sheet in Tamil that the Editor has been kindly translating to me.
('59', 372, 4, 18, 668716) It contains nothing but libels against reformers.
('59', 372, 4, 19, 668766) There is in it what purports to be a report of my conversation with a Madura Pandit 1 who came to see me some time ago.
('59', 372, 4, 20, 668886) One correspondent wonders if, as the report has tried to make out, I could have said that there were no chaste women in India.
('59', 372, 4, 21, 669013) The whole report is a caricature, the most material portions having been omitted.
('59', 372, 4, 22, 669095) But I must not fill the columns of Harijan with a transcript of the caricature and the true version of the conversation of which Mahadev Desai took notes at the time.
('59', 372, 4, 23, 669262) But I reproduce the portion relating to women.

('59', 373, 0, 1, 669435) 374 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 373, 1, 2, 669477) is first a free translation of the Tamil report:
('59', 373, 2, 3, 669526) GANDHI: Should a pure woman consort with her husband when he is given up to sinful ways?
('59', 373, 3, 4, 669615) THE PANDIT: Yes.
('59', 373, 3, 5, 669632) The sinful husband will be metamorphosed into a virtuous man by the chastity of the wife.
('59', 373, 4, 6, 669722) GANDHI: Are there chaste women in these days?
('59', 373, 5, 7, 669768) PANDIT: How can we say there are none?
('59', 373, 5, 8, 669807) There may be virtuous women for all we know.
('59', 373, 5, 9, 669852) But why wander from our topic of conversation?
('59', 373, 5, 10, 669899) Let us go on with our discussion.
('59', 373, 5, 11, 669933) Be it noted that the Madura Pandit or his friend took no notes.
('59', 373, 5, 12, 669997) Here is the relevant portion of Mahadev Desai’s notes:
('59', 373, 6, 13, 670052) PANDIT: The temples are intended for women and Shudras.
('59', 373, 6, 14, 670108) According to Shastras, Shudras only can enter the temples today, because they alone are observing their swadharma 1‘ viz., service, and chaste women have the same right.
('59', 373, 6, 15, 670278) The others are burdened with karmas and duties, which now they have ceased to perform and, therefore, not entitled to enter a temple.
('59', 373, 7, 16, 670412) GANDHI: So whilst a Brahmin may be a karma Chandala 2‘ his chaste wife may be entitled to enter a temple.
('59', 373, 8, 17, 670518) PANDIT: The wife because of her chastity purifies her husband.
('59', 373, 9, 18, 670581) GANDHI: Then, the moment a man has a wife who is pure, he becomes pure, no matter what sort of life he lives.
('59', 373, 10, 19, 670691) PANDIT: Yes; his wife saves him.
('59', 373, 11, 20, 670724) GANDHI: A man may go to the dogs, and yet if his wife is chaste, he becomes pure?
('59', 373, 12, 21, 670806) PANDIT: Yes, his wife saves him; though what he does is wrong, his sins will be neutralized.
('59', 373, 12, 22, 670899) GANDHI: So, if a man wants to remain immune from the consequences of his acts, all that he has to do is to be armed with a chaste wife.
('59', 373, 13, 23, 671035) PANDIT: Quite so.
('59', 373, 14, 24, 671053) GANDHI: Well, then, since we are not going to impute bad character to a single woman in India, for we must assume every one of them to be pure, unless, of course, she admits that she is impure or she has been found to be impure—every married man is pure and there should be no untouchability.
('59', 373, 15, 25, 671346) PANDIT: She should be a true pativrata, a genuinely chaste woman, described
('59', 373, 16, 26, 671422) 1 Duty of oneself 2 Untouchable for one’s actions
('59', 374, 0, 1, 671472) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 375
('59', 374, 1, 2, 671517) in our religious books like Ramayana.
('59', 374, 2, 3, 671555) GANDHI: How are you to determine that a particular woman satisfies that definition?
('59', 374, 3, 4, 671639) PANDIT: Agni pariksha.
('59', 374, 3, 5, 671662) She must prove her chastity by undergoing the ordeal
('59', 374, 4, 6, 671715) through fire, as Sita did.
('59', 374, 5, 7, 671742) GANDHI: And so, those who cannot come scatheless out of it must be declared to be impure?
('59', 374, 6, 8, 671832) PANDIT: Indeed.
('59', 374, 7, 9, 671848) GANDHI: I have done.
('59', 374, 7, 10, 671869) Enough, however, about the Tamil sheet.
('59', 374, 7, 11, 671909) A Gujarati sheet published by one claiming to be a sanatanist Shastri and now distributed broadcast in Hindi by sanatanist papers in North India professes to publish excerpts from my writings, sixty in all, which have the effect of proving me to be the very embodiment of everything anti Hindu.
('59', 374, 7, 12, 672204) Excerpts are torn from their context and made to bear a meaning the opposite of what they have when read in their context.
('59', 374, 7, 13, 672327) Here is a sample of statements attributed to me:
('59', 374, 8, 14, 672376) My parents and Sita were Bhangis.
('59', 374, 9, 15, 672410) The Shastras are the productions of hypocrites, and the sages are so many Satans.
('59', 374, 10, 16, 672492) I regard a Bhangi to be superior to a Brahmin.
('59', 374, 11, 17, 672539) I am an iconoclast.
('59', 374, 11, 18, 672559) Now my correspondents, some of them frankly puzzled, invite me to deal with these charges.
('59', 374, 11, 19, 672650) I must respectfully but resolutely decline the invitation.
('59', 374, 11, 20, 672709) If there are people who will believe of me the things that are said in the writings sent to me, no refutation will save me.
('59', 374, 11, 21, 672833) The public must take me as I am.
('59', 374, 11, 22, 672866) What is more, the cause is everything, I am nothing..
('59', 374, 11, 23, 672920) If the campaign against untouchability is just and necessary for the very existence of Hinduism, it will survive the reputation of a thousand Gandhi.
('59', 374, 11, 24, 673070) What is, however; sad, almost tragic, about these libellous statements is that they are made by responsible sanatanists reported to be learned men and presumed to be holy men fit to be religious teachers of unsophisticated simple folk.
('59', 374, 11, 25, 673306) Their curious interpretations of the Shastras, their refusal to read the signs of the times, their defence of obviously superstitions and even inhuman beliefs and customs, one can understand as being honestly held.
('59', 374, 11, 26, 673521) What may appear as superstitious and inhuman to the reformer may not appear so to
('59', 375, 0, 1, 673603) 376 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 375, 1, 2, 673645) But the resort by responsible pandits to untruths, distortions and suppression of truth is bound to do incalculable harm to Hindus and Hinduism.
('59', 375, 1, 3, 673790) Let sanatanists put up as stubborn a fight as they like in defence of what they regard as a good cause.
('59', 375, 1, 4, 673894) But I implore them to weed it of untruth.

('59', 375, 6, 9, 674124) actions.
('59', 375, 6, 10, 674133) They are always ready to give all the Hindus, whether touchables or
('59', 375, 7, 11, 674201) untouchables, every help they can.
('59', 375, 7, 12, 674236) They give the untouchables priests,
('59', 375, 8, 13, 674272) preceptors, Shastras with Ramnam, etc.
('59', 375, 8, 14, 674311) But there are some so called educated
('59', 375, 9, 15, 674349) persons who always hate those untouchables.
('59', 375, 9, 16, 674393) They are always keeping aloof
('59', 375, 10, 17, 674423) from them and they want to pollute the sanatanists with the impurity brought
('59', 375, 11, 18, 674500) by them from non Hindus.
('59', 375, 11, 19, 674525) The foregoing I have taken from a fairly long letter and I have taken it as a sample from many such letters.
('59', 375, 11, 20, 674634) ‘Hate, is perhaps the wrong word.
('59', 375, 11, 21, 674668) I should use the word ‘despise’.
('59', 375, 11, 22, 674701) And if to relegate a body of people to distant locations, to regard their touch, approach or sight as pollution, to throw at them the leavings of one’s food, to deny to them the use of public roads and institutions, even the use of public temples, is not to despise them, I do not know what the word ‘despise, means.
('59', 375, 11, 23, 675018) The writer says that the untouchables have priests and preceptors.
('59', 375, 11, 24, 675085) My own experience and the experience of numerous reformers is to the contrary.
('59', 375, 11, 25, 675164) Despairing of real priests, they have raised from among themselves what must be called ‘an apology for priests’.
('59', 375, 11, 26, 675277) The writer betrays the secret when he says that untouchables have the “Shastras with Ramnam”, implying that they can have no access to any other Shastras.
('59', 375, 11, 27, 675432) What are their daily customs and daily actions which evoke hatred?
('59', 375, 11, 28, 675499) Their daily action was described in graphic terms by the Poet in his message 1 for our first issue.
('59', 375, 11, 29, 675599) Save for carrion eating, their customs are the same as those of innumerable caste Hindus.
('59', 375, 11, 30, 675689) And carrion eating is by no means common to all the

('59', 376, 1, 2, 675808) untouchables so called.
('59', 376, 1, 3, 675832) If a census were taken, we would be astonished to find that there are so few.
('59', 376, 1, 4, 675910) I hope to present the readers of Harijan with reliable statistics in this matter.
('59', 376, 1, 5, 675992) And I have not a shadow of a doubt that caste Hindus are responsible for this habit of carrion eating and that, immediately they are welcomed as brothers and sisters and are offered the ordinary amenities of life on the same terms as caste Hindus, that habit will automatically drop out.
('59', 376, 1, 6, 676280) Lastly, the common experience is that whatever has been done for the Harijans by caste Hindus has been done by those who have received education or who are otherwise ranked as reformers.
('59', 376, 1, 7, 676467) It will give me pleasure to know that sanatanists as such have done much or anything for Harijans.
('59', 376, 1, 8, 676566) I would gladly publish the list of their charities or other acts of service rendered to Harijans.

('59', 376, 4, 11, 676717) Some readers are anxious to know when, if at all, Harijan will be published in Hindi and other languages of the country.
('59', 376, 4, 12, 676838) The idea was to publish the Hindi edition first and the English and the other editions after.
('59', 376, 4, 13, 676932) But, as there was delay in publishing the Hindi edition, the Chairman of the Central Board of the Servants of Untouchables Society authorized the publication of the English edition without waiting for the former.
('59', 376, 4, 14, 677145) I am happy to be able to inform the reader that the Hindi edition will have been out before this is in his hands.
('59', 376, 4, 15, 677259) Arrangements are proceeding as fast as possible for the publication of provincial editions in the provincial languages, e.g., in Bengali, Marathi, Tamil, Gujarati, etc.
('59', 376, 4, 16, 677428) My prescription has been and is that they should all be self supporting.
('59', 376, 4, 17, 677501) Moneys that are being collected for and by the Central and the Provincial Boards must be predominantly spent among the Harijans, i.e., for their educational and economic uplift.
('59', 376, 4, 18, 677679) The weekly journals and leaflets are part of the necessary propaganda chiefly among caste Hindus.
('59', 376, 4, 19, 677777) Therefore, they should pay for it.
('59', 376, 4, 20, 677812) Except up to a point, I do not believe in presenting the public with free literature on any subject.
('59', 376, 4, 21, 677913) It may be ever so cheap, but never free.
('59', 376, 4, 22, 677954) I believe in the old Sanskrit proverb, ‘Knowledge is for those who would know’.
('59', 376, 4, 23, 678034) But these are my personal views.
('59', 376, 4, 24, 678067) I can only tender my advice to the organizations and organizers.

('59', 378, 3, 4, 679195) DEAR MAJOR BHANDARI’ As you know I have been endeavouring during my present incarceration to study the heavens.
('59', 378, 3, 5, 679307) You have kindly allowed astronomical literature to come in to me.
('59', 378, 3, 6, 679373) I need a fair sized astronomical telescope.
('59', 378, 3, 7, 679417) Lady Vithaldas has one and has kindly consented to give me a loan of it.
('59', 378, 3, 8, 679490) Ramnathan and Desai of the Government observatory (Poona) who put the telescope right say that I won’t be able to use it unless they gave personal directions.
('59', 378, 3, 9, 679649) They need to be with me for that purpose for about half an hour after the stars are observable.
('59', 378, 3, 10, 679745) If there is any objection to this lesson being given to me in the yard in which I am kept during the night, it may be given in the yard reserved for untouchability interviews.
('59', 378, 3, 11, 679921) I shall thank you if you will please ascertain the wishes of the Government in the matter.

('59', 378, 9, 20, 680219) ALAM’ I was delighted to have your letter and to observe that you were making steady progress.
('59', 378, 9, 21, 680314) If she continues to be as careless as she has been in her Urdu writing in her latest letter, please tell Begum Alam that I shall have to tone down my compliments.

('59', 380, 8, 15, 683083) These sacrifices are a relic of barbarism and it would be a great sin if, in the face of the anti untouchability movement with temple entry as a part of it, animal sacrifices are not stopped altogether.

('59', 382, 3, 4, 684908) DEAR FRIEND’ I have your letter.
('59', 382, 3, 5, 684941) You are quite right in thinking that the object of the anti untouchability movement is to level down the distinctions of high and low.
('59', 382, 3, 6, 685076) There would be to the end of time different professions and occupations, different qualities also, but none of these differences necessitate the distinction of high and low.
('59', 382, 3, 7, 685250) The motive behind the temple entry is from this standpoint easily understood.
('59', 382, 3, 8, 685328) It is to demonstrate to the Hindu mind and to the world that in the house of God there is no one high and no one low.
('59', 382, 3, 9, 685446) This is a reform wanted by those caste Hindus who have got the conviction that hitherto the treatment meted out to the so called untouchables has been sinful and contrary to the spirit of Hinduism.Those who think that temple entry has anything to do with Congress politics are wholly mistaken.

('59', 383, 6, 9, 686876) DEAR MR. JAYAKAR’ I see you have the old enemy 1 again.
('59', 383, 6, 10, 686932) I hope however that with the aid of good medical advisers you have successfully routed him.
('59', 383, 6, 11, 687024) I wonder if you were able to pass on my letter 2 about the opening 3
('59', 383, 7, 12, 687093) ceremony to Vinayakrao 4. He has certainly done very good social work in Ratnagiri, and it must have been a very serious disappointment to him, as also to Sjt.
('59', 383, 7, 13, 687253) Kir that you were disabled from performing the opening ceremony.
('59', 383, 7, 14, 687318) I hope you got my second letter 5 together with the letter about the Ratnagiri temple.
('59', 383, 7, 15, 687405) With the letter I sent you a copy of the Government’s reply to my letter and of my rejoinder.
('59', 383, 8, 16, 687499) Yours sincerely,

('59', 384, 6, 12, 688682) I quite agree with you that so far as the civil rights are concerned, we can make no distinction between Christian untoucha bles and Hindu untouchables, except that where Christians have special facilities for education you need not worry about them.
('59', 384, 6, 13, 688933) About the other letter, I am unable to say anything definite in the absence of fuller information, but this I can say that if the rites are intended as a condition precedent to their admission to varnashramadharma, I am wholly opposed to the performance of the rites; if on the other hand, they are meant for their betterment and as part of a spiritual instruction, they might be quite harmless and even beneficial, if the selection is properly made and the rites are performed by men, qualified both by their character and learning.
('59', 384, 7, 14, 689467) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('59', 385, 3, 4, 689700) MY DEAR HARIBHAU’ I had a very long conversation with Upasak.
('59', 385, 3, 5, 689762) His wife is a very unsteady woman, she may even desert him any day and she is wholly incapable of observing self restraint.
('59', 385, 3, 6, 689886) Such a couple cannot possibly go to the Ashram where brahmacharya is indispensable.
('59', 385, 3, 7, 689970) I do not think also that Upasak will be able to conform to all the conditions of the Board, but he says that if the grant up to April is now paid, i.e., Rs. 22, he will try to do what he can to keep the school going and he will take his chance if he cannot.
('59', 385, 3, 8, 690228) I think that this is a proposal worth considering.
('59', 385, 3, 9, 690279) If, therefore, it is possible, I recommend Rs. 22 being paid to him with the absolute warning that nothing more will be paid to him thereafter.

('59', 386, 10, 19, 691748) The simplest manner in which I can put before you my views about the education of children is that they should be put in the company of people having a character beyond reproach.

('59', 387, 6, 11, 692723) Many people dedicate books to others without waiting for their permission.
('59', 387, 6, 12, 692798) You can also do likewise.
('59', 387, 6, 13, 692824) I can do nothing to you.
('59', 387, 6, 14, 692849) For me to give you the permission would mean that I have read your book and have generally approved of it.
('59', 387, 6, 15, 692956) You will admit that this I cannot honestly do.

('59', 387, 10, 20, 693143) February 25,1933
('59', 387, 11, 21, 693160) RAMDAS’ Khushaldas has passed away.
('59', 387, 11, 22, 693196) I received both the accompanying letters yesterday evening.
('59', 387, 11, 23, 693256) I have written to Shantilal and informed him.
('59', 387, 11, 24, 693302) Khushaldas has indeed been released from the suffering of this life.
('59', 387, 11, 25, 693371) The truth is that everybody who goes on a journey along that royal road is released from this life.
('59', 387, 11, 26, 693471) For this life is given to us for repaying our debts, and nobody can leave before he has paid off his.
('59', 387, 11, 27, 693573) If this idea is correct, death means that the person has paid off his debt
('59', 388, 0, 1, 693648) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 389
('59', 388, 1, 2, 693693) partially at least.
('59', 388, 1, 3, 693713) He who knows with perfect conviction that this life is given to us for repaying our debts can repay his debts to all, and the ancients described that as attaining moksha.
('59', 388, 1, 4, 693884) Moksha means complete freedom from debt and, consequently, end of the cycle of births for the person.
('59', 388, 1, 5, 693986) I was pained to see your condition yesterday, your broken health and your mental suffering.
('59', 388, 1, 6, 694078) I had no remedy for either, and was pained because you attributed to your father more power than he possessed.
('59', 388, 1, 7, 694189) I felt as Harishchandra had done.
('59', 388, 1, 8, 694223) He had become ready to sell his only son for the sake of dharma.
('59', 388, 1, 9, 694288) I have been doing very much the same thing.
('59', 388, 1, 10, 694332) Though I know the remedy for your poor health, I cannot adopt it because of my concern for dharma, nor can end your mental suffering for the same reason If you follow the rule that you cannot avail yourself of facilities which other prisoners who keep bad health would not get, you can do nothing to improve your health.
('59', 388, 1, 11, 694653) I can understand that you would not like to ask for special facilities for yourself but it does not seem right to me that you should not avail yourself of facilities which may be offered to you when you explain to the authorities the condition of your health.
('59', 388, 1, 12, 694913) When you are outside, you enjoy more facilities than the countless millions and never think about the matter.
('59', 388, 1, 13, 695023) I ask for and enjoy, both in jail and outside, facilities which they can never hope to get, and am fully aware that I do so.
('59', 388, 1, 14, 695148) But I do not feel that I violate dharma thereby.
('59', 388, 1, 15, 695197) If an elephant tries to crawl like an ant, he will not succeed in becoming an ant thereby and will cease to be an elephant, which means that he will have lost his true nature.
('59', 388, 1, 16, 695373) An elephant like me, however, would humbly accept his big size and consume food weighing more than thousands of ants and would also draw, without the least effort, loads which those ants could never draw.
('59', 388, 1, 17, 695578) An elephant is entitled to consume food which the size of his body requires.
('59', 388, 1, 18, 695655) Only, he must not waste that food by not giving proportionate service in return.
('59', 388, 1, 19, 695736) That is, he should carry loads proportionate to his strength.
('59', 388, 1, 20, 695798) If he does that, he will have consumed as much food and given as much service as an ant.
('59', 388, 1, 21, 695887) This is communism.
('59', 388, 1, 22, 695906) If, therefore, you can secure the food which your body requires by legitimate means and without humiliating yourself for the purpose, you should do so and improve your health, and then serve other people to the best of your ability.
('59', 388, 1, 23, 696139) But even in trying to serve other people and securing facilities for yourself by legitimate means, you should know and understand
('59', 389, 0, 1, 696269) 390 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 389, 1, 2, 696311) your duty as a prisoner.
('59', 389, 1, 3, 696336) A prisoner has no right except that of preserving his self respect, for he ceases to be the master of his body as soon as he becomes a prisoner and the jail superintendent becomes its master.
('59', 389, 1, 4, 696528) Even if the latter does not give the prisoner enough to eat or to drink or sufficient clothes to wear, the prisoner should remain contented and cheerful.
('59', 389, 1, 5, 696682) Anybody who cannot do so is not a true prisoner.
('59', 389, 1, 6, 696731) We must admit that in this age the British policy towards prisoners is comparatively more liberal than that of any other government.
('59', 389, 1, 7, 696864) It is improving day by day.
('59', 389, 1, 8, 696892) There is certainly room for much more improvement still, but that is another matter.
('59', 389, 1, 9, 696977) A prisoner may fight to bring about such improvement.
('59', 389, 1, 10, 697031) If, however, he remembers the general principle stated above, he will not be disappointed if he fails in his attempt—for he has no absolute right to enjoy any facility.
('59', 389, 1, 11, 697200) If you understand this reasoning fully, I shall be relieved and you will be able to overcome your mental unrest.
('59', 389, 1, 12, 697313) I will certainly try to do what I can in regard to everything which you mentioned—but in my own way, and that is bound to take time.
('59', 389, 1, 13, 697446) The delay will not make me impatient, and I wish that you also should not be.
('59', 389, 1, 14, 697524) What can you or I do?
('59', 389, 1, 15, 697546) Certainly we are not masters of the result.
('59', 389, 1, 16, 697590) We can only try the best that we can.
('59', 389, 1, 17, 697628) You have been doing what you can, and I also will do what I can.
('59', 389, 1, 18, 697693) Even if we don’t succeed, you should dance with joy, and so will I.
('59', 389, 2, 19, 697761) Be not moved by joy or sorrow; with the body were they created;
('59', 389, 3, 20, 697825) None can escape them for by the Lord of Raghu were they decreed.
('59', 389, 3, 21, 697890) Do you follow all this?
('59', 389, 3, 22, 697914) Read the letter three or four times, and if you do not follow any point ask me to explain it again.
('59', 389, 3, 23, 698014) Keep me informed about the condition of your health.

('59', 391, 4, 7, 699839) Being nearly 15 years younger than you, I should be a four year old baby expecting to grow new teeth.
('59', 391, 4, 8, 699941) How nice!
('59', 391, 4, 9, 699951) Then the sanatanist friends can swear at me to their heart’s content for many, many years to come.
('59', 391, 4, 10, 700050) But no such good luck for them.
('59', 391, 4, 11, 700082) For with your silvery beard, even little children won’t take you to be only 18. They would vote us down as old humbugs wishing to give them no chance.
('59', 391, 4, 12, 700233) If you get your Rs. 2’000 from the Maharajah, it would be a good start.
('59', 391, 5, 13, 700305) You should waylay all the lecturers that come there.
('59', 391, 5, 14, 700358) They should give you something for the great cause.
('59', 391, 5, 15, 700410) Poor Rehana!
('59', 391, 5, 16, 700423) I had a note from her.
('59', 391, 5, 17, 700446) You will not hurry her out of Poona if she is comfortable at Nanavati’s.
('59', 391, 5, 18, 700519) Do you know what time it is now?
('59', 391, 5, 19, 700552) Not yet 4 a.m.
('59', 391, 5, 20, 700567) Good morning.
('59', 391, 5, 21, 700581) Love from us all.

('59', 391, 10, 24, 700658) February 26, 1933
('59', 391, 11, 25, 700676) NARANDAS, Champa has written to me about repairs in her bungalow and the need for getting it painted.
('59', 391, 11, 26, 700778) She also wishes to go to some hill station during the summer.
('59', 391, 11, 27, 700840) If painting and repairs are necessary, get them done.
('59', 391, 11, 28, 700894) About her desire to go to a hill station, I have put some questions to her in my letter.
('59', 391, 11, 29, 700983) Read it.
('59', 391, 11, 30, 700992) Does she remain on good terms
('59', 391, 12, 31, 701022) 1 This was the form of greeting between Gandhiji and the addressee.
('59', 391, 12, 32, 701090) 2 The addressee was collecting funds in Kathiawar for Harijan work.
('59', 392, 0, 1, 701158) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 393
('59', 392, 1, 2, 701203) with you?
('59', 392, 1, 3, 701213) Does she behave with proper courtesy?
('59', 392, 1, 4, 701251) How is Ratilal?
('59', 392, 1, 5, 701267) Does he wish to go to a hill station?
('59', 392, 1, 6, 701305) Read my letter to Parashuram.
('59', 392, 1, 7, 701335) He wishes to spend some time with Rajaji.
('59', 392, 1, 8, 701377) I don’t know whether the latter will give his consent.
('59', 392, 1, 9, 701432) Can you make him free for two months?
('59', 392, 1, 10, 701470) Who will teach Hindi during his absence?
('59', 392, 1, 11, 701511) Tell Kusum that as I wrote to her separately some time ago, I don’t write to her today.
('59', 392, 1, 12, 701599) I shall get another opportunity to write separately to her.
('59', 392, 2, 13, 701659) BAPU [PS.] In all there are 14 letters.
('59', 392, 2, 14, 701699) They are all stitched together.

('59', 392, 4, 16, 701774) 541. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
('59', 392, 5, 17, 701805) February 26, 1933
('59', 392, 6, 18, 701823) NARANDAS, I got your letter.
('59', 392, 6, 19, 701852) You will find with this a letter for Bhagwanji and one for Panditji.
('59', 392, 6, 20, 701921) I believe that up to a certain quantity (12 ounces) milk is supplied to a prisoner at the cost of the jail.
('59', 392, 6, 21, 702029) Personally I am glad that you have told Hariyomal that he could come back.
('59', 392, 6, 22, 702104) Such persons learn only through experience.
('59', 392, 6, 23, 702148) Your suggestion regarding Parvati is excellent.
('59', 392, 6, 24, 702196) If it is acted upon, both will be free.
('59', 392, 6, 25, 702236) We must bear the expenses of Prabhudas’s journeys.
('59', 392, 6, 26, 702287) He is rather timid.
('59', 392, 6, 27, 702307) He will probably take time to find a partner, and it may even be a difficult task.
('59', 392, 6, 28, 702390) He will not get over his restlessness till he marries.
('59', 392, 6, 29, 702445) The forcible repression of his strong desire to marry was the cause of his restlessness.
('59', 392, 6, 30, 702534) Your remaining firm about the problem of Lakshmi is very necessary.
('59', 392, 6, 31, 702602) I cannot understand Dudabhai’s opposition.
('59', 392, 6, 32, 702645) I have had no letter from Purushottam.
('59', 392, 6, 33, 702684) I did ask him to write to me.
('59', 392, 6, 34, 702714) I don’t think fasting will do him any harm.
('59', 392, 6, 35, 702758) If he knows how to break the fast gradually, he is bound to benefit from it.
('59', 392, 6, 36, 702835) If the bone setter knows his job well, there will be no harm.
('59', 392, 6, 37, 702897) It will probably be safer to get Kanu
('59', 393, 0, 1, 702935) 394 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 393, 1, 2, 702977) examined by Haribhai 1. If Mathuradas remains firm in his resolve, Motibehn will give up her opposition.
('59', 393, 1, 3, 703082) It has been my unfailing experience that if one of the two parties is firm and the other party knows that he or she cannot be shaken from his or her resolve, the latter resigns herself or himself to the situation.
('59', 393, 1, 4, 703296) As we forget in time our grief even over the death of one who was dearest to us, so also this folly leaves us by and by.
('59', 393, 1, 5, 703417) The truth is there is some weakness in both parties and that is why they need each other’s support.
('59', 393, 1, 6, 703517) Really speaking, such support is of no avail.
('59', 393, 1, 7, 703563) If it helps any couple to keep their resolve, the fact must be counted as an accident.
('59', 393, 1, 8, 703650) How can a blind person lead another blind person?
('59', 393, 1, 9, 703700) How can one who is drowning save another in the same plight as himself?
('59', 393, 1, 10, 703772) How can a person who is not free from passion help his or her partner to be so?
('59', 393, 1, 11, 703852) The reasoning is quite simple.
('59', 393, 1, 12, 703883) You need not take any trouble to enlist subscribers for Harijan.
('59', 393, 1, 13, 703948) We will send five copies to the Ashram addressed to no particular subscribers.
('59', 393, 1, 14, 704027) You may use them in any way that you can.
('59', 393, 1, 15, 704069) See if you can maintain a file with four out of the five copies, or with the copies which remain unsold.
('59', 393, 1, 16, 704174) Some day they will be useful.
('59', 393, 1, 17, 704204) I got Satyarthaprakash, the slivers and the leather for the soles.
('59', 393, 1, 18, 704271) Kellogg’s book must have been sent to Dhulia jail for Madhavji.
('59', 393, 1, 19, 704335) Or it was with somebody in Vijapur.
('59', 393, 1, 20, 704371) I am sure about this.

('59', 393, 6, 24, 704543) PREMA, Do not expect a long letter today.
('59', 393, 6, 25, 704585) I have been writing so much with the right hand that it has got tired now.
('59', 393, 6, 26, 704660) Nor have I much time.
('59', 393, 6, 27, 704682) I got the slivers sent by you.
('59', 393, 6, 28, 704713) They were received yesterday evening.
('59', 393, 6, 29, 704751) I spun with them today.
('59', 393, 6, 30, 704775) Assuming that their weight as stated by you is correct, I see that I can spin yarn of 60 counts with slivers made from the devkapas variety of cotton.
('59', 393, 6, 31, 704926) I will give half the quantity

('59', 394, 1, 3, 705041) He has better skill in handling slivers than I have.
('59', 394, 1, 4, 705094) Very probably he will be able to spin yarn of 100 counts at the very first attempt.
('59', 394, 1, 5, 705178) You give no news about your health.
('59', 394, 1, 6, 705214) Is your throat all right?
('59', 394, 1, 7, 705240) How is the backache?

('59', 394, 3, 12, 705465) While there, you may help Jamnadas in any way you can.
('59', 394, 3, 13, 705520) If you are completely cured there, the improvement will remain even after you have left Rajkot.
('59', 394, 3, 14, 705616) Let me know your daily programme of work and also your diet.
('59', 394, 3, 15, 705677) Those who have money ought to help others.
('59', 394, 3, 16, 705720) Those who cannot meet their needs in any other way, like totally disabled people and sannyasis (genuine),etc., deserve to be helped.
('59', 394, 3, 17, 705853) The mendicant may be deserving if he gives all his time to social service and accepts no other return.
('59', 394, 3, 18, 705956) The woman certainly deserves help.

('59', 394, 6, 26, 706266) The interpretation which you put upon his wire 1 is correct.
('59', 394, 6, 27, 706327) From the wire it seems that he has an open mind on the subject.

('59', 395, 5, 12, 707065) It is a nice idea to visit them on Sundays.
('59', 395, 5, 13, 707109) Try if possible to make this arrangement.
('59', 395, 5, 14, 707151) It would be enough if the Friday programme is shifted to Sunday.
('59', 395, 5, 15, 707216) Discuss it with Narandas.
('59', 395, 5, 16, 707242) If your conduct is spotless, it will definitely influence them.
('59', 395, 5, 17, 707306) It is inevitable that you should mix with older people.
('59', 395, 5, 18, 707362) They also will be won over by love and service.
('59', 395, 5, 19, 707410) Sometimes you may invite the Harijan children to the Ashram.
('59', 395, 5, 20, 707471) Before inviting them take permission from Narandas.
('59', 395, 5, 21, 707523) I regard it as good news that the weights of most of you have gone up and also the counts of the yarn.

('59', 395, 8, 30, 707968) Anyway I have written something in this connection in the current issue of Harijan.

('59', 396, 2, 3, 708226) February 26,1933
('59', 396, 3, 4, 708243) It is unfortunate that untruth is being preached these days in the name of the sanatana dharma.
('59', 396, 3, 5, 708339) I am receiving many new sanatanist newspapers which abound in untruth and indecency.
('59', 396, 3, 6, 708424) I have been severely attacked in them.
('59', 396, 3, 7, 708463) Many correspondents ask me to write something in reply to them.
('59', 396, 3, 8, 708527) What can I write?
('59', 396, 3, 9, 708545) Some say I do not believe in religion.
('59', 396, 3, 10, 708584) In answer to that, except for me to say that religion is my life breath what other reply can I give?
('59', 396, 3, 11, 708685) A learned religious propagandist has written in the same vein.
('59', 396, 3, 12, 708748) I can only give this reply to it that every word of it is almost entirely untrue.
('59', 396, 3, 13, 708830) His words are not proved untrue because I say so, just as, his mere saying so does not establish what he says as truth.
('59', 396, 3, 14, 708950) Still untruth can be resisted by truth alone.
('59', 396, 3, 15, 708996) It is necessary to understand this great saying.
('59', 396, 3, 16, 709045) The root of all actions is in thought.
('59', 396, 3, 17, 709084) False thoughts result in false utterances; and after that, or along with it or without the utterances, action follows.
('59', 396, 3, 18, 709203) In the same way right action has its roots in right thoughts.
('59', 396, 3, 19, 709265) If the thought is not true then that action or utterance which seems true is only false, is erroneous.
('59', 396, 3, 20, 709368) That is to say, if I am entirely truthful even in my thoughts falsehood will be warded off automatically.
('59', 396, 3, 21, 709474) People will not believe these canards.
('59', 396, 3, 22, 709513) This firm faith keeps me unperturbed, and my friends also should be unperturbed.
('59', 396, 3, 23, 709594) This false propaganda cannot last long.
('59', 396, 3, 24, 709634) It is that for a short while the atmosphere will be contaminated by it.
('59', 396, 3, 25, 709706) In every agitation such things always happen.
('59', 396, 4, 26, 709752) Let the reformer remember one thing.
('59', 396, 4, 27, 709789) Let him never even contemplate untruth.
('59', 396, 4, 28, 709829) We have a great religious mission before us.
('59', 396, 4, 29, 709874) The abolition of untouchability is the great religious task before me, an onerous duty.
('59', 396, 4, 30, 709962) To eradicate untouchability is the supreme duty of every Hindu.
('59', 396, 4, 31, 710026) We can never accomplish this religious task with untruth.
('59', 396, 4, 32, 710084) Ultimately anger or violence is also untruth.
('59', 396, 4, 33, 710130) For this reason, it is necessary for those who serve Harijans never to be angry with their opponents; never to utter lies; but to overcome anger with affection, rudeness with courtesy, falsehood with truth, and violence with non violence.
('59', 396, 4, 34, 710369) And since we cannot control the outcome but can certainly practise truth and other virtues, God has said, “You have
('59', 397, 0, 1, 710485) 398 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 397, 1, 2, 710527) only the right to action; and not to the fruit thereof.” 1 If all those who serve Harijans will stick to truth, then the result will only be good.
('59', 397, 1, 3, 710674) There is no doubt whatever in this.

('59', 397, 4, 6, 710804) February 26, 1933
('59', 397, 5, 7, 710822) A gentleman writes:
('59', 397, 6, 8, 710842) You are very hasty.
('59', 397, 6, 9, 710862) Although a non co operator, you even seek help
('59', 397, 7, 10, 710909) from the Assembly.
('59', 397, 7, 11, 710928) Why such weakness?
('59', 397, 7, 12, 710947) Negotiate with the sanatanists and
('59', 397, 8, 13, 710982) have the temples thrown open.
('59', 397, 8, 14, 711012) I replied to this gentleman on these lines: I am not hasty.
('59', 397, 8, 15, 711072) I am striving to fulfil my pledge.
('59', 397, 8, 16, 711107) In Bombay, at the end of September, this large conference of Hindus leaders on behalf of the Hindus resolved to strive to get the temples thrown open to Harijans in as peaceful a manner as possible.
('59', 397, 8, 17, 711306) Now this difficulty has cropped up in our way, namely, the British courts have decided that Harijans cannot enter many temples.
('59', 397, 8, 18, 711434) Even a consensus among Hindus cannot abolish the law.
('59', 397, 8, 19, 711488) Law can be abrogated by law alone.
('59', 397, 8, 20, 711523) So legislation has become necessary and Shri Ranga Iyer has presented the Bill.
('59', 397, 8, 21, 711603) It does not have even a hint of force or of interference with religion.
('59', 397, 8, 22, 711675) According to the Bill, if the Hindu public wish so, temples can be thrown open to the Harijans.
('59', 397, 8, 23, 711771) The temples will be thrown open when Hindu public decide to do so; never by the Bills.
('59', 397, 8, 24, 711858) There is no question of co operation or non co operation in this.
('59', 397, 8, 25, 711924) But this matter is outside my province today.
('59', 397, 8, 26, 711970) People should have this much faith that if I, the author of the principle of non co operation, am a partisan to the passing of these Bills, the possibility of the principle being violated is very little.
('59', 397, 8, 27, 712174) The important thing is that it is the duty of those who made the solemn declaration in Bombay to do their utmost to remove the legal obstruction.
('59', 397, 8, 28, 712320) Only then can they say:
('59', 397, 9, 29, 712344) Rather die than go back upon one’s word.

('59', 398, 3, 5, 712638) I received your telegram.
('59', 398, 3, 6, 712664) I had sent a reply.
('59', 398, 3, 7, 712684) I have also received Hindi Harijan 1 today.

('59', 399, 8, 10, 714188) February 27,1933
('59', 399, 9, 11, 714205) BHAI VIYOGI HARI, I have gone through Harijan Sevak; I did not like it.
('59', 399, 9, 12, 714277) It requires more labour and more study.
('59', 399, 9, 13, 714317) It contains the news of the opening of the Santram temple at Nadiad.
('59', 399, 9, 14, 714386) The news is published despite the fact that the Santram temple has not been thrown open.
('59', 399, 9, 15, 714475) No news item should be quoted from the papers without verifying it.
('59', 399, 9, 16, 714543) Publication of such news always undermines one’s prestige and harms the cause of dharma.
('59', 399, 9, 17, 714632) The prefix ‘it is reported’ is certainly there but who can thank you for it?
('59', 399, 9, 18, 714709) Very many things are reported but few turn out to be true on verification.
('59', 399, 9, 19, 714784) This must now be corrected.
('59', 399, 9, 20, 714812) Enquire from the head of the Santram temple.
('59', 399, 9, 21, 714857) The account of activities has taken up too much space.
('59', 399, 9, 22, 714912) It indicates that you had nothing left to print and that is why even after so much space being used up the lower portion remained blank.
('59', 399, 9, 23, 715049) And that is an eyesore.
('59', 399, 9, 24, 715073) You could have found sufficient material from the two issues of Harijan lying with you.
('59', 399, 9, 25, 715161) Certainly there was no lack of time.
('59', 399, 9, 26, 715198) The translation of my article should have borne at the end the appellation ‘translation’.
('59', 399, 9, 27, 715288) Even the translation is not satisfactory.
('59', 399, 9, 28, 715330) Harijan Sevak should not be stuffed with articles but it should be a guide to the workers and should abound with news.
('59', 399, 9, 29, 715449) The problems facing the sanatanists should be indicated and solutions suggested.
('59', 399, 9, 30, 715530) The falsehoods of the sanatanists should be exposed at the appropriate time.
('59', 399, 9, 31, 715607) Hence we must receive exhaustive reports from all provinces.
('59', 399, 9, 32, 715668) The letters published already in Aaj need not be reproduced.

('59', 400, 5, 8, 716059) February 28,1933
('59', 400, 6, 9, 716076) DEAR THAKKAR BAPA, I know you don’t believe in giving yourself rest.
('59', 400, 6, 10, 716145) I propose to join you in not giving you rest.
('59', 400, 6, 11, 716191) Mahadev wrote to you at my instance yesterday about the wretched get up of the Harijan Sevak, both as to the matter and the manner.
('59', 400, 6, 12, 716323) I sent even a telegram to Viyogi Hari.
('59', 400, 6, 13, 716362) Today I send you what has appealed to me as an extraordinarily clever report on the Harijan organizations of the Punjab.
('59', 400, 6, 14, 716483) I am dealing with it in the ensuing Harijan, but you should circulate the copies of the enclosed report among the Punjab organizations and get their replies.
('59', 400, 6, 15, 716641) If you think that there is absolutely nothing to be said for the report and that it simply contains a series of exaggerations and unsupported statements, naturally you will not go to the expense of copying the report and multiply your and your staff’s work.
('59', 400, 6, 16, 716899) You will then return me the report with a brief note that it is not worthy of consideration.
('59', 400, 6, 17, 716992) Perhaps you know the writer; if you do, you will let me know all about him.
('59', 400, 6, 18, 717068) I am still in correspondence with him.
('59', 400, 6, 19, 717107) I wonder if you read the English Harijan.
('59', 400, 6, 20, 717149) It is addressed to you personally as it is to every Harijan servant, because it contains suggestions for workers, appeals to them, as also arguments to arm them for their battle.
('59', 400, 6, 21, 717328) Arguments and appeals you may not need at all, but suggestions you must welcome, no matter from what quarter they come.
('59', 400, 6, 22, 717448) There is one suggestion of my making in my article on the Punjab report which I do not want to duplicate, because I expect you to see it in the Harijan.
('59', 400, 6, 23, 717601) If you see a flaw in the reasoning, or if you find it to be impossible to carry out, you will tell me and if your counter argument appeals to

('59', 401, 7, 12, 718232) With reference to your question in your letter of 23rd instant, my emphatic answer is, like the rest, the present priesthood is decadent.
('59', 401, 7, 13, 718370) If it was not, we should find Hinduism in a different state altogether.

('59', 402, 3, 4, 718603) DEAR DR.
('59', 402, 3, 5, 718612) KATJU, I thank you for your valuable letter.
('59', 402, 3, 6, 718657) 1 I am glad that yourdaughter is happy with her husband.
('59', 402, 3, 7, 718714) I know you will do all you can for the Harijan.
('59', 402, 3, 8, 718762) I appreciate your argument about temple entry.
('59', 402, 3, 9, 718809) In my opinion, based even upon the present experience of new temples which are being opened, the donors have no fixed ideas.
('59', 402, 3, 10, 718934) They simply build temples for Hindus without a rigid definition for the class of Hindus to be admitted to the temples.
('59', 402, 3, 11, 719053) Hinduism has never been a rigid faith.
('59', 402, 3, 12, 719092) It has kept abreast of the times.
('59', 402, 3, 13, 719126) Untouchables of today were not the untouchables, say, a hundred years ago, and those who were untouchables a thousand years ago are undoubtedly not untouchables today.
('59', 402, 3, 14, 719294) Would you say that the English law of Trusts is applicable to Hindu usage?
('59', 402, 3, 15, 719369) Some of the most learned Shastris who are no reformers of the Western style do not hesitate to give the opinion that Hindu public temples should never have been closed to untouchables.
('59', 402, 3, 16, 719554) According to your argument, our ancestors could stop the march of Hinduism by opening temples in accordance with the usage then in existence.
('59', 402, 3, 17, 719696) I would like you therefore to re consider your position, and if there is a flaw in my deductions from your argument, I would like you to strive with me.
('59', 402, 3, 18, 719849) For I have no desire to see any injustice done to any party or person.
('59', 402, 4, 19, 719920) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('59', 402, 6, 24, 720073) for many many centuries, rightly or wrongly, untouchables have not been allowed access to public temples.
('59', 402, 6, 25, 720179) it seems to me that it is not so much a question of Hindu Shastras or their right and correct interpretation, but in truth a question of what the founder must be deemed or presumed to have intended.
('59', 402, 6, 26, 720378) otherwise I do not see what right has the majority to override the intention of the founder, and it may be open to any member of the Hindu public to appeal to a civil court to give effect to the intentions of the founder.

('59', 406, 3, 5, 724048) It is very good indeed that Devdas has arrived.
('59', 406, 3, 6, 724096) You must not be impatient for serving others.
('59', 406, 3, 7, 724142) First of all improve your health, everything else will be all right then.
('59', 406, 3, 8, 724216) If Dr. Sharma puts his trust in God and has a sincere wish to go to the Ashram his path will be cleared by Him.
('59', 406, 3, 9, 724328) If the doctor has full faith in his treatment the Ashram offers good scope and the people will learn to trust him.
('59', 406, 3, 10, 724443) However, he must not hope for the present to sell his books.

('59', 406, 9, 19, 724743) March 1,1933 Newcomers do find the routine a stiff business.
('59', 406, 9, 20, 724804) But we are trying to live the life of the billions of the earth.
('59', 406, 9, 21, 724869) They are toilers all the day long.
('59', 406, 9, 22, 724904) They have to do their thinking whilst their bodies are working.
('59', 406, 9, 23, 724968) When the routine becomes natural, it becomes pleasant and does not interfere with hard thinking.
('59', 406, 9, 24, 725065) All thinking is not useful.
('59', 406, 9, 25, 725093) Clear thinking is the need.
('59', 406, 9, 26, 725121) That can only come through continuous sacrifice, i.e., toiling for the service of others.

('59', 407, 2, 3, 725677) March 1,1933
('59', 407, 3, 4, 725690) NARANDAS, I got your mail (a big packet).
('59', 407, 3, 5, 725732) I think it would be best to serve rice to Maitri and others who insist on it.
('59', 407, 3, 6, 725810) We may only explain the properties of the different classes of grain and not press anybody to follow our advice.
('59', 407, 3, 7, 725923) These properties are a matter of direct experience.
('59', 407, 3, 8, 725975) I see from experience every day that we should consume a minimum of starches.
('59', 407, 3, 9, 726053) Rice is pure starch, and so it is served to people who cannot digest any other grains.
('59', 407, 3, 10, 726140) The derogatory use of the term “rice eater’, is perfectly justified.
('59', 407, 3, 11, 726209) But this argument will convince only those who use their reason.
('59', 407, 3, 12, 726274) It is not at all likely to appeal to a person whose stomach will not tolerate anything but rice.
('59', 407, 3, 13, 726371) I could write a great deal more on this subject, but I have no time for that.
('59', 407, 3, 14, 726449) Ramabehn saw me yesterday.
('59', 407, 3, 15, 726476) You have not won her trust.
('59', 407, 3, 16, 726504) Try harder.
('59', 407, 3, 17, 726516) She wishes to learn English.
('59', 407, 3, 18, 726545) She wishes to do so in spare time after doing her work for the Ashram.
('59', 407, 3, 19, 726616) Go and meet her.
('59', 407, 3, 20, 726633) Listen to what she has to say and request Mathew or Mary or Duncan to give her one hour daily.
('59', 407, 3, 21, 726728) Do all you can to satisfy her desire to learn English.
('59', 407, 3, 22, 726783) If any of the women who are old inmates of the Ashram wish to learn English, their desire is natural.
('59', 407, 3, 23, 726885) We feel the necessity of its knowledge every hour, and also observe that as soon as a person learns English he or she goes up in the esteem of others.
('59', 407, 3, 24, 727036) We cannot check this tide.
('59', 407, 3, 25, 727063) There is no harm in knowing the language itself.
('59', 407, 3, 26, 727112) The harm comes from the misuse of the language, from its blind worship.
('59', 407, 3, 27, 727184) Women are not likely to cultivate such an attitude soon.
('59', 407, 3, 28, 727241) If you see any flaw in this reasoning, point it out to me.

('59', 408, 2, 3, 727419) Morning, March 2, 1933
('59', 408, 3, 4, 727442) NARANDAS, You must have received the letter which I wrote to you yesterday.
('59', 408, 3, 5, 727518) Make careful preparations for Lakshmi’s marriage and see that everything goes well.
('59', 408, 3, 6, 727602) Jamna and you should give away the bride, and Velanbehn should offer the bridegroom.
('59', 408, 3, 7, 727687) If possible, I will send Lakshmidas there.
('59', 408, 3, 8, 727730) As usual, keep a dhoti, shirt, cap, takli and a copy each of the Gita and the Bhajanavali ready for the bridegroom.
('59', 408, 3, 9, 727846) Tie the marriage knot with the ends.
('59', 408, 3, 10, 727883) Give a translation of the vows 1 to both the bride and the bridegroom.
('59', 408, 3, 11, 727954) And they should fast on that day and eat nothing till after the ceremony is over.
('59', 408, 3, 12, 728036) You, Jamna and Velanbehn also should fast.
('59', 408, 3, 13, 728079) Both the bride and the bridegroom should perform the ceremonial worship of the cow and the tree and recite Chapter XII of the Gita.
('59', 408, 3, 14, 728211) It is not necessary to invite any friends except Anasuyabehn.
('59', 408, 3, 15, 728273) We don’t want the marriage to be published in newspapers, though we do not wish to keep it a secret either.
('59', 408, 3, 16, 728381) The bride and the bridegroom may leave for home by the night train and start working immediately.
('59', 408, 3, 17, 728479) Velanbehn will arrange for the sari on behalf of Maruti.
('59', 408, 3, 18, 728536) If you wish to ask any other question, you may do so.
('59', 408, 3, 19, 728590) Invite all Harijan friends to attend the wedding.
('59', 408, 3, 20, 728640) If you wish, you may serve them refreshments.
('59', 408, 3, 21, 728686) In that case, I believe fruit will be the best.
('59', 408, 3, 22, 728734) But consult your own convenience in all this, and make any changes which you feel necessary.
('59', 408, 3, 23, 728827) Let the members of the Committee come together and plan the arrangements.
('59', 408, 3, 24, 728901) Invite the senior women inmates also to the meeting of the Committee.
('59', 408, 3, 25, 728971) Let the day of marriage be for us a sacred day of tapascharya and self purification and one to be celebrated in keeping with our ideal of simplicity and self control.
('59', 408, 3, 26, 729138) Let all present shower their blessings on the bride and the bridegroom.
('59', 408, 3, 27, 729210) Maruti’s letters simply fill me with admiration for him.
('59', 408, 3, 28, 729267) If he remains true to the aspirations which he expresses in them, we shall believe that he must have become a member of Lakshmidas’s family blessed with the holy merit of his good deeds in previous lives.
('59', 408, 3, 29, 729472) Lakshmidas’s love for him, too, must be wonderful beyond words.

('59', 409, 1, 3, 729801) Explain to everybody in the Ashram that it is the universal experience that anybody who does not give his best, physically and mentally in serving the sick, can do no other useful work, and that the Ashram exists to enable its inmates to serve others.
('59', 409, 1, 4, 730053) Nobody in the Ashram, therefore, should be half hearted in doing service.
('59', 409, 2, 5, 730127) BAPU [PS.] Doesn’t Velanbehn keep well?
('59', 409, 2, 6, 730167) Read my letter to Dudabhai.
('59', 409, 2, 7, 730195) I have not pressed him to attend the wedding.

('59', 409, 6, 13, 730485) Please forgive me.
('59', 409, 6, 14, 730504) I see that it required a prompt reply.
('59', 409, 6, 15, 730543) I hope, however, that this will be in time for you in helping you to come to a decision if you had not arrived at it when this reaches you.
('59', 409, 6, 16, 730683) I have no hesitation in saying that you should accept the invitation 1 of the Y. W. C. A. if they will bear the expense of the journey.
('59', 409, 6, 17, 730819) Poor workers must not be expected to find the expenses themselves.
('59', 409, 6, 18, 730886) I hope the Harijan gives you all the information you may need about the untouchability movement.

('59', 410, 3, 6, 731417) You must now begin to tell me something about your children, and the many things that you teach them and how you teach them.
('59', 410, 3, 7, 731542) You don’t think that those things will not interest me.
('59', 410, 3, 8, 731598) They will, because they might be of use for the Ashram children.
('59', 410, 3, 9, 731663) You should tell me also as a teacher what you would do to and for the Ashram children if you had them under your charge.

('59', 410, 6, 18, 731987) I know she will be delighted with it.
('59', 410, 6, 19, 732025) Probably you wrote the same time that you wrote to me.

('59', 410, 6, 21, 732150) I posted a letter 1 last week to Tangai and just gave you a line only.
('59', 410, 6, 22, 732221) I hope she felt duly proud to receive a letter all to herself, put in an envelope bearing her address, and I hope that she sent me a thousand kisses when she got that letter.
('59', 410, 6, 23, 732396) As I am pouring out my heart through Harijan, I feel that I have nothing more to say to the members of the growing family.

('59', 411, 3, 5, 733066) With the restrictions natural in a prison house, you will not expect me to discuss the political aspect of your paper.

('59', 411, 3, 7, 733329) I have no axe to grind.

('59', 412, 2, 3, 734169) March 2, 1933
('59', 412, 3, 4, 734183) MY DEAR NELLIE1, Next time when you feel like writing you should trace the spelling of your name.
('59', 412, 3, 5, 734281) As I read your signature I can only make out ‘Mell Bull’.
('59', 412, 3, 6, 734339) I can easily read ‘Bull’ as ‘Ball’, but Esther confounds me.
('59', 412, 3, 7, 734400) She has clearly spelt your name as ‘Nellie Ball’.
('59', 412, 3, 8, 734450) I have therefore adopted her clear spelling in preference to your doubtful ‘Mell’.
('59', 412, 3, 9, 734533) If therefore I have made any mistake you must go for Esther.
('59', 412, 3, 10, 734594) But I see that you are a little philosopher with a big heart.
('59', 412, 3, 11, 734656) Therefore you will exclaim, ‘What is in a name?
('59', 412, 3, 12, 734704) It is the spirit that matters’.
('59', 412, 3, 13, 734736) And whether I trace Mell or Nellie my spirit goes out to you, the little invalid daughter.
('59', 412, 3, 14, 734827) But I propose a peremptory change in the way you describe yourself.
('59', 412, 3, 15, 734895) Your body is no doubt shattered, but your spirit seems to have risen triumphant over the body.
('59', 412, 3, 16, 734990) I do not want to think of you therefore as my ‘little invalid daughter’, but my ‘little daughter strong with the faith in God’.
('59', 412, 3, 17, 735118) Now that C. F. Andrews is there you will certainly have the joy of receiving visits from him frequently and not only rarely.
('59', 412, 3, 18, 735243) He is a genius for seeking out persons like you and going to them as often as he can.
('59', 412, 3, 19, 735329) To visit people in power is a tax upon his mind.
('59', 412, 3, 20, 735378) To visit people like you and me is a matter of perennial joy to him.
('59', 412, 3, 21, 735447) He derives his strength from his association with those whom the world calls weak and helpless and who often but wrongly feel so themselves.
('59', 412, 3, 22, 735588) But I must now stop.
('59', 412, 3, 23, 735609) You should give my love to your doctor and ask him to write to me about you.

('59', 413, 6, 9, 736379) MY DEAR MURIEL, I know you will always be wandering.
('59', 413, 6, 10, 736432) That is part of your work and therefore it does not appear to me quite as horrible as you think it might.
('59', 413, 6, 11, 736538) I hope your new child will not fare as badly as the preceding one.
('59', 413, 6, 12, 736605) Of course those who have read your book 1 do not mind having read it, but these are very few.
('59', 413, 6, 13, 736699) Those who do not want to know anything about your having entertained a funny little man cannot be blamed for not wanting your book.
('59', 413, 6, 14, 736831) There must be quite a few thousand people who would like to know the story of Kingsley Hall and Children’s House dedicated to the service of the neglected poor.
('59', 413, 6, 15, 736992) Why were you sorry that John Morris was being removed to an old workhouse?
('59', 413, 6, 16, 737067) Would he not get there the same kind treatment he had at the hospital?
('59', 413, 6, 17, 737138) Where is the place situated?
('59', 413, 6, 18, 737167) I suppose you will see him often enough, or, is the workhouse far away from you?
('59', 413, 6, 19, 737248) When you see him you should take my love to him.
('59', 413, 6, 20, 737297) I see you are in your 18th year and so is the Ashram at Sabarmati.
('59', 413, 6, 21, 737364) Let us hope that both the institutions pass muster in God’s book.

('59', 414, 3, 4, 737661) DEAR SISTER, I continue to receive your letters fairly regularly.
('59', 414, 3, 5, 737727) You must not hesitate to write as often as you like so long as you don’t always expect prompt acknowledgement from me.
('59', 414, 3, 6, 737846) I hope you got over the effects of the hurt long ere this reaches you.
('59', 414, 3, 7, 737917) I am glad you possess all the volumes of the Upanishads.
('59', 414, 3, 8, 737974) Some of them will no doubt appear dry to you, but I am quite sure that you will not miss the central teaching which permeates all the principal Upanishads.
('59', 414, 3, 9, 738130) But no teaching, however lofty it may be, enables us to control our nerves and our senses.
('59', 414, 3, 10, 738221) That control only comes from incessant prayer from the heart and from utterly selfless service.

('59', 414, 8, 17, 738602) Every help that comes counts in the midst of the difficulties that are being created day after day.
('59', 414, 8, 18, 738702) I hope you are fast regaining your lost strength.
('59', 414, 8, 19, 738752) I wonder if you have seen the Madras Law Review’s opinion on

('59', 415, 1, 5, 739175) I personally think that Mr. Rajah’s Bill deserves support.
('59', 415, 1, 6, 739234) You had my telegram 2 in reply to yours.
('59', 415, 1, 7, 739275) Whether for the moment we succeed or not, we must continue to create public opinion in favour of the Bills and make such effort as is possible to have them passed.
('59', 415, 1, 8, 739439) That we did not succeed on the 27th does not worry me.
('59', 415, 1, 9, 739494) I hope you are following carefully what I am writing for the Harijan.

('59', 415, 5, 17, 739874) March 2,1933
('59', 415, 6, 18, 739887) MY DEAR GHANSHYAMDAS, I have received from Mr. M. I. David Rs. 2,500. So far as I know, it is the first answer to the appeal on behalf of his scheme.
('59', 415, 6, 19, 740037) Mr. David wants to remain anonymous.
('59', 415, 6, 20, 740074) I am sending the money to you by registered and insured packet.
('59', 415, 6, 21, 740138) For the present you will please retain the money on account of the David Scheme.
('59', 415, 6, 22, 740219) It would be better to put it so as to bear interest at once.
('59', 415, 6, 23, 740280) We won’t need to use it all at once and I expect to get his own letter which he has promised.
('59', 415, 6, 24, 740374) I think that we ought to be able to announce a few scholarships.
('59', 415, 6, 25, 740439) You blessed the scheme, the Bombay board blessed the scheme and if it ends with a solitary subscriber, and that also the creator himself, it would be a miniature disaster.
('59', 415, 6, 26, 740611) Do, therefore, induce Lala Shreeram and others at least to give these paltry sums and let me announce some

('59', 417, 5, 8, 742602) March 2,1933
('59', 417, 6, 9, 742615) Gandhiji stated in reply to a question that, if the necessary permission was given, he would, after duly examining the terms of the permission, quite willingly make a declaration of his policy on political questions.
('59', 417, 6, 10, 742832) But just now he was not thinking about it at all.
('59', 417, 6, 11, 742882) Politics was excluded from his thoughts.
('59', 417, 6, 12, 742923) He was deliberately practising and doing this for two reasons, firstly, that he might not be burdened with its weight when he had another subject in hand to which he had been permitted to devote attention, and secondly nothing might escape his lips, even inadvertently, which would be tantamount to a breach of faith with the Government.
('59', 417, 6, 13, 743261) He was now so constituted that he could not discuss politics.
('59', 417, 6, 14, 743323) He added: It is a wonderful gift God has given me.
('59', 417, 7, 15, 743374) Did it mean he was not interesting himself in contemporary political events?
('59', 417, 7, 16, 743451) Gandhiji replied: Oh yes, but only as a foreigner would.
('59', 417, 7, 17, 743508) I note them in passing, but I bestow little thought on them.
('59', 417, 7, 18, 743569) Of course, if the ban is lifted, and I am permitted to speak, I can, without any difficulty, speak on questions of policy and fundamental principles.
('59', 417, 8, 19, 743719) He added that those agents in his brain who were now on leave would then begin to work.
('59', 417, 9, 20, 743807) Asked if in his own opinion, the Harijan movement had not diverted attention from civil disobedience, Gandhiji replied: Surely, it is a matter which everyone can decide for himself, because, all the materials are before him.
('59', 417, 9, 21, 744032) One might as well ask me what is the height of the Himalayas when both he and I are seeing it.
('59', 417, 9, 22, 744127) one will say it is 23,000 feet, another 25,000.
('59', 417, 10, 23, 744175) Asked as to what was his estimate of the height, Gandhiji replied at once.

('59', 420, 10, 14, 746839) BHAI AMAR SINGH,
('59', 420, 11, 15, 746856) I got your letter.
('59', 420, 11, 16, 746875) It is only through silent service that one can reach God and realize the self for, such service reveals that all are equal.
('59', 420, 11, 17, 746999) I am glad to know that your are well now.
('59', 420, 12, 18, 747041) Blessings from

('59', 420, 16, 21, 747115) The following important opinion 1, on the question of temple entry, of Sjt.
('59', 420, 16, 22, 747191) T. R. Venkatarama Sastri, ex Law Member of the Madras Government, is taken from the daily Press.
('59', 420, 17, 23, 747288) KELKAR’S COMPROMISE
('59', 420, 18, 24, 747308) N. C. Kelkar was good enough to pay me a visit at my request to discuss the question of temple entry.
('59', 420, 18, 25, 747410) I was anxious to know what he thought of the proposed legislation.
('59', 420, 18, 26, 747477) He said that
('59', 420, 19, 27, 747490) 1 Not reproduced here.
('59', 420, 19, 28, 747513) It said that temple entry legislation did not infringe the property rights of anyone.
('59', 421, 0, 1, 747599) 422 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 421, 1, 2, 747641) he had for years held that there was no way out of legislation in matters, even affecting religion, where a law alone could set them right, as in the case of temple entry.
('59', 421, 1, 3, 747813) Judge made law had ordained that trustees of public Hindu temples were bound to pre vent Harijans from entering them.
('59', 421, 1, 4, 747931) No amount of public opinion could undo that law.
('59', 421, 1, 5, 747980) It could demand the passage of a law but could not make the law permitting temple entry.
('59', 421, 1, 6, 748069) Whilst, therefore, Sjt.
('59', 421, 1, 7, 748093) Kelkar agreed that measures like Sjt.
('59', 421, 1, 8, 748131) Ranga Iyer’s were necessary, he said that actual temple entry would only be effected by amicable settlement.
('59', 421, 1, 9, 748240) He had no doubt that Harijans should enter temples on precisely the same terms as caste Hindus.
('59', 421, 1, 10, 748336) But public opinion might not be ripe for the former’s admission to the sanctuaries.
('59', 421, 1, 11, 748420) If so, the caste Hindus should forgo the rights which Harijans could not have.
('59', 421, 1, 12, 748499) He, therefore, suggested that in all the public temples there should be a common barrier set up, beyond which nobody but the priest actually in charge of the ceremonial could go.
('59', 421, 1, 13, 748678) This would mean that, in some temples where now caste Hindus are able to enter the sanctuary and touch the idol, they would have to deny themselves that right, if they were not prepared to let Harijans enjoy it equally with them.
('59', 421, 1, 14, 748908) I said I should have no objection whatsoever to such a compromise, provided, of course, that it was honestly carried out in practice.
('59', 421, 1, 15, 749042) Nothing would please me better than to see this unseemly domestic wrangle close at the earliest moment.

('59', 421, 2, 17, 749164) 590. A WAIL FROM KUMAON
('59', 421, 3, 18, 749188) A Harijan correspondent from Haldvani writes complaining that nothing is being done by caste Hindus on their behalf in his district.
('59', 421, 3, 19, 749321) This complaint is a sign that the message of the September resolutions has reached the Harijan masses and that, therefore, they are expecting great things.
('59', 421, 3, 20, 749477) Provincial Boards of the Servants of Untouchables Society will have to organize their work so as to penetrate the remotest village and let the Harijans know that every attempt is being made to fight the monster of untouchability.

('59', 422, 1, 2, 749770) 591. JOINT OR SEPARATE?
('59', 422, 2, 3, 749794) Correspondents suggest that there should be separate temples, schools, wells, etc., for Harijans for the time being.
('59', 422, 2, 4, 749911) A general adoption of the suggestion may easily be the way to perpetuate untouchability, and we might as well have had separate electorates and elections for them, if we are to have everything else separate for them.
('59', 422, 2, 5, 750128) I would certainly not have staked my life just to avoid separate electorates.
('59', 422, 2, 6, 750206) I staked it, and it is still at stake, for the purpose of eradicating the present unnatural untouchability from the religion itself.
('59', 422, 2, 7, 750339) I rose against separate electorates, because it would have spelt an end to the effort for the destruction of the canker.
('59', 422, 2, 8, 750460) They would have meant an end to effective penance by the penitent caste Hindu.
('59', 422, 2, 9, 750539) With the Yeravda Pact, such penance is a possibility, whether the penitents are in the majority or the minority.
('59', 422, 2, 10, 750652) That there is a mighty upheaval in Hinduism and that we have two well defined divisions working actively for their respective objectives is the surest justification for the Yeravda Pact.
('59', 422, 2, 11, 750839) As a result of it, the religious untouchability goes or the reformer.
('59', 422, 2, 12, 750909) If he is to be true to his pledge, the reformer has no other choice.
('59', 422, 2, 13, 750978) Therefore, separate temples and separate other services must be regarded with suspicion.
('59', 422, 2, 14, 751067) Let us consider the limitations of the suggestion.
('59', 422, 2, 15, 751118) Till the legal obstacle in the way of opening public temples to untouchables is removed, the opening of existing temples on a large scale comes to a standstill.
('59', 422, 2, 16, 751279) But the march of reform cannot be stayed.
('59', 422, 2, 17, 751321) There are three ways of doing the thing.
('59', 422, 2, 18, 751362) (a) Where public opinion and trustees are quite demonstrably in favour of opening temples, trustees may open the temples under their charge and may take the risk of an injunction being issued against them.
('59', 422, 2, 19, 751568) (b) Private temples should be opened where the owners are willing to open them.
('59', 422, 2, 20, 751648) (c) Wealthy and spiritually minded people may open new temples under pure methods of consecration.
('59', 422, 2, 21, 751747) (I add the adjective advisedly because I believe that all is not well with the existing temples.) These temples will be purposely designed for the Harijans as well as for the other Hindus.
('59', 422, 2, 22, 751936) These must, therefore, be situated in such
('59', 423, 0, 1, 751979) 424 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 423, 1, 2, 752021) localities as are easily accessible to Harijans.
('59', 423, 1, 3, 752070) Common schools and wells should be opened where the existing ones are not available for Harijans either owing to the violent and successful opposition of the neighbours or some other unavoidable cause.
('59', 423, 1, 4, 752272) Harijans cannot be left uncared for in matters of necessary services till public opinion has ripened.
('59', 423, 1, 5, 752374) If there is a clearly awakened body of Hindus who have the same feeling towards Harijans as if they were their own kith and kin, they will not wait for public opinion to consolidate itself before taking action.
('59', 423, 1, 6, 752585) They will do their best to supply pure water and good education to their own newly found kith and kin.
('59', 423, 1, 7, 752688) There is one special consideration in favour of opening what may be called preparatory schools for Harijan children.
('59', 423, 1, 8, 752805) I cannot do better than quote the reason in the words of a co worker who has gone to live in their midst and who writes: 1
('59', 423, 2, 9, 752928) My school is conducted in a Harijan verandah.
('59', 423, 2, 10, 752974) Some of my scholars are .
('59', 423, 2, 11, 753000) full of dirt.
('59', 423, 2, 12, 753014) My lesson, therefore, begins with telling them how to keep clean, and behave.
('59', 423, 2, 13, 753092) They are bad liars.
('59', 423, 2, 14, 753112) Some of them are industrious and wise.
('59', 423, 2, 15, 753151) I play with them and perhaps learn more than I teach.
('59', 423, 2, 16, 753205) I begin my class in the early morning.
('59', 423, 2, 17, 753244) I sleep in a Harijan dharmasala about a furlong from the school.
('59', 423, 2, 18, 753309) I naturally sometimes enter their homes when they do not mind.
('59', 423, 2, 19, 753372) Many of them are dark holes with inmates packed like matches.
('59', 423, 2, 20, 753434) But I am a novice.
('59', 423, 2, 21, 753453) I know my limitations.
('59', 423, 2, 22, 753476) I long to fulfil God’s conditions for becoming a true Vaishnav.
('59', 423, 2, 23, 753540) This is but a sample of the condition of raw Harijan children.
('59', 423, 2, 24, 753603) We want every one of these children to learn to live in a clean and decent manner.
('59', 423, 2, 25, 753686) We want them all to attend the common public schools.
('59', 423, 2, 26, 753740) Therefore, preparatory schools for them are an absolute essential if we mean honest business.

('59', 423, 5, 29, 753877) The Secretary of the Jat Pat Torak Mandal, i.
('59', 423, 5, 30, 753923) e., Society for the Abolition of Caste, has published in the daily Press his letter to me of the 18th ultimo.
('59', 423, 5, 31, 754033) He does me the honour of calling me a ‘deep thinker’ and in the same breath withdraws it by saying:
('59', 423, 6, 32, 754133) You have failed to see that the caste system is the origin of
('59', 423, 7, 33, 754195) 1 Only extracts are reproduced here
('59', 424, 0, 1, 754231) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 425
('59', 424, 1, 2, 754276) untouchability and that one cannot do without the other.
('59', 424, 1, 3, 754333) I venture to suggest to the Secretary that, if he is really honest in his paying me the compliment, he must suspend his judgement about the caste system and follow out the reasoning of the ‘deep thinker’ of his imagination; whereas if he has called me a ‘deep thinker’ in order to increase the height from which I have fallen, I fear that no reasoning of mine will affect him.
('59', 424, 1, 4, 754710) However, according to my wont, I propose to give the Secretary credit for honesty and shall, therefore, strive with him.
('59', 424, 1, 5, 754831) I am one of those who think that the caste system, in so far as it is the English equivalent for varnashrama, is nothing but a division of labour or duty.
('59', 424, 1, 6, 754986) Anyone who will take the trouble of looking at any religious book must find this out for himself.
('59', 424, 1, 7, 755084) In that sense the divisions or classes are four and no more, and these classes are known all the world over.
('59', 424, 1, 8, 755193) One is the repository of knowledge, the other is that of power, the third is that of wealth and the fourth is that of service.
('59', 424, 1, 9, 755320) All these four labours are regarded as duties to be discharged by every one of them for the protection and advancement of dharma, and everyone who performs his duty to the best of his knowledge and ability gains equal merit with the rest, if the latter, too, do likewise.
('59', 424, 1, 10, 755592) The merit, therefore, consists not in being one or the other, but in the performance of the duty assigned to it.
('59', 424, 1, 11, 755705) Here, there is no untouchability.
('59', 424, 1, 12, 755739) There is no superiority.
('59', 424, 1, 13, 755764) And this is the essence of varnadharma.
('59', 424, 1, 14, 755804) It may be non existent today and it is so.
('59', 424, 1, 15, 755847) That, however, in no way diminishes the force of my argument that there is no superiority and inferiority in the original conception of varnadharma and that untouchability can never be a necessary outcome of this pure division of duties.
('59', 424, 1, 16, 756085) If this varnashrama cannot be revived in its original simplicity and purity, persons like me would consider it to be a calamity.
('59', 424, 1, 17, 756214) Others may welcome it, but let varnadharma and untouchability stand or fall on their own merits or demerits.
('59', 424, 1, 18, 756323) Confusing the two can only add to the difficulty of removal of untouchability, which all reformers and even many sanatanists desire.
('59', 424, 1, 19, 756456) The caste abolitionists must, therefore, hold their souls in patience and join the battle against the common and admitted evil of untouchability.
('59', 424, 1, 20, 756602) Varnashrama, as I interpret it, satisfies the religious, social and economic needs of a community.
('59', 424, 1, 21, 756701) It satisfies the religious needs, because a whole community, accepting the law, is free to devote ample
('59', 425, 0, 1, 756805) 426 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 425, 1, 2, 756847) time to spiritual perfection.
('59', 425, 1, 3, 756877) Observance of the law obviates social evils and entirely prevents the killing economic competition.
('59', 425, 1, 4, 756977) And if it is regarded as a law laying down, not the rights or the privileges of the community governed by it, but their duties, it ensures the fairest possible distribution of wealth though it may not be an ideal, i.e., strictly equal, distribution.
('59', 425, 1, 5, 757227) Therefore, when people in disregard of the law mistake duties for privileges and try to pick and choose occupations for self advancement, it leads to confusion of varna and ultimate disruption of society.
('59', 425, 1, 6, 757432) In this law, there is no question of compelling any person to follow the parental occupation against his or her aptitude; that is to say, there can be no compulsion from without as there was none for, perhaps, several thousand years, during which the law of varnashrama worked without interruption.
('59', 425, 1, 7, 757731) By training, the people had recognized the duty and the justice of the law, and they voluntarily lived under it.
('59', 425, 1, 8, 757844) Today, nations are living in ignorance and breach of that law and they are suffering for it.
('59', 425, 1, 9, 757937) The so called civilized nations have by no means reached a state which they can at all regard with equanimity and satisfaction.
('59', 425, 1, 10, 758065) It is easy enough to see that this conception of varnashrama has nothing to do with restrictions as to inter dining and intermarriage.
('59', 425, 1, 11, 758200) The Vedas and the Mahabharata are filled with illustrations both of inter dining and intermarriage.
('59', 425, 1, 12, 758300) But these are matters of choice, not a matter of religious regulation.
('59', 425, 1, 13, 758371) No one can be compelled or required to dine with any other or contract marital relations.
('59', 425, 1, 14, 758461) No doubt social habits will grow up and regulate these things more or less rigidly.
('59', 425, 1, 15, 758545) But it would be wrong to dignify them by the name of religious observances.
('59', 425, 1, 16, 758621) Therefore, inter dining and intermarriage can form no part of the campaign against untouchability.
('59', 425, 1, 17, 758720) In so far as they are a matter for reform, they must be treated, in my opinion, as an absolutely separate subject, unconnected either with untouchability or even with varnashrama reform.
('59', 425, 1, 18, 758907) So far as the multiplicity of castes apart from varnadharma are concerned, they are essentially trade guilds or societies, with intermarriage and inter dining restrictions of a more or less rigid character superimposed upon them.
('59', 425, 1, 19, 759137) Castes are as numerous as the leaves of the famous banana tree whose every branch becomes a trunk for shooting out more branches.
('59', 425, 1, 20, 759267) They are undergoing a perpetual transformation.
('59', 425, 1, 21, 759315) Many have disappeared and new ones are appearing.
('59', 425, 1, 22, 759365) Surely they have nothing to do with varnashrama; nor have they anything to do with religion.
('59', 425, 1, 23, 759458) That today they are regarded by sanatanists as an integral part of Hinduism arises,
('59', 426, 0, 1, 759542) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 427
('59', 426, 1, 2, 759587) in my opinion, from an utter ignorance of the working of these trade guilds.
('59', 426, 1, 3, 759664) There are undoubtedly many undesirable practices that have crept into these corporations, but that is only because Hinduism as a religion has ceased to be a living, vitalizing force.
('59', 426, 1, 4, 759847) We are today living upon capital which is itself being fast exhausted.

('59', 426, 4, 8, 760143) As the reader may remember, this amount covers five years’ expenses for one Harijan student.

('59', 426, 4, 10, 760324) I hope that this announcement will result in inducing others to send in their donations.

('59', 426, 8, 14, 760592) This measure is not likely to give much relief to the Harijans from the disabilities they are suffering from.

('59', 427, 2, 4, 761254) The first issue was published on the 23rd ultimo.
('59', 427, 2, 5, 761304) 1 It is the same size as the English edition and has no paid advertisements.

('59', 427, 6, 25, 762840) You have pointed out 3 that the use of the word ‘Harijan’ to denote the untouchable class in the present movement inaugurated in their behalf has by no means been novel and that the word had thus been used previously by a Gujarati poet.
('59', 427, 6, 26, 763077) I have taken up the pen just to let you know, as the news is

('59', 428, 1, 2, 763297) likely to give you particular pleasure, that the very word has been used in the same sense by Moropant, the celebrated Maharashtrian poet.
('59', 428, 1, 3, 763436) The stanza 1 in question is as follows.
('59', 428, 1, 4, 763476) Similar testimony is to be found in the writings not only of the other saints of Maharashtra but also the saints of the whole of India.
('59', 428, 1, 5, 763612) If industrious scholars will collect such sayings of the saints from different parts of the country, I shall gladly hand them to the Editor for publication in the Harijan, and they will be a help and an inspiration to the workers in the cause of the abolition of untouchability.

('59', 428, 3, 7, 763909) 597. AS THEY SEE US
('59', 428, 4, 8, 763929) Hardly has the great central organization of the Servants of Untouchables Society made the commencement, when complaints against it and the provincial organizations have cropped up.
('59', 428, 4, 9, 764111) They come chiefly and naturally from Harijans.
('59', 428, 4, 10, 764158) One of these correspon dents sent to me some time ago an able letter, undertaking to give details if I desired.
('59', 428, 4, 11, 764270) I took him at his word and asked him to give me details; and the letter he has sent me in reply is abler than the first.
('59', 428, 4, 12, 764391) It will compete with any well written report of an inspector.
('59', 428, 4, 13, 764453) It contains a summary of reports of every organization claiming to work in the writer’s Province for the uplift of Harijans, and after giving me suffi cient details, his one conclusion about all the organizations practically without exception is:
('59', 428, 5, 14, 764700) They are run principally by caste men who have their own axes to grind
('59', 428, 6, 15, 764771) or who are in need of some occupation that would maintain them decently.
('59', 428, 7, 16, 764844) utmost that some of these have done is to fling a few scholarships at Harijan
('59', 428, 8, 17, 764922) Some others have been great at delivering lectures.
('59', 428, 8, 18, 764974) All have come to us
('59', 428, 9, 19, 764994) as patrons.
('59', 428, 9, 20, 765006) Hardly has anyone come as a friend and equal, let alone as a
('59', 428, 10, 21, 765067) servant.
('59', 428, 10, 22, 765076) Your provincial organization is no exception.
('59', 428, 10, 23, 765122) It is difficult for a
('59', 428, 11, 24, 765144) Harijan to approach its chief man without fear and trembling.
('59', 428, 11, 25, 765206) He is always in
('59', 428, 12, 26, 765222) danger of being met with a frown.
('59', 428, 12, 27, 765256) My correspondent is also not without suggestions, which may be
('59', 428, 13, 28, 765319) 1 Which is translated as follows: “In your superior wisdom you give Harijans names like Mahar, Yawan, Kunbi.
('59', 428, 13, 29, 765428) It is the fruit of the tree that reveals the property concealed in the seed (i.e., actions reveal the man).”
('59', 429, 0, 1, 765537) 430 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 429, 1, 2, 765579) summarized thus: If you are to take advantage of the great awakening that has taken place, you must concentrate upon primary education on a mass scale.
('59', 429, 1, 3, 765731) You will not drive out the ignorance of ages without spreading that education.
('59', 429, 1, 4, 765810) We shall certainly help, but seeing that caste Hindus want to remove untouchability and make us one with them, there is no better way of employing their money and their labour than in imparting this education.
('59', 429, 1, 5, 766020) It is necessary to know the Harijan mind in any programme of work that may be taken up.
('59', 429, 1, 6, 766108) Caste Hindus, for whom removal of untouchability is a matter of penance and purification, have undoubtedly to do much more than open schools everywhere.
('59', 429, 1, 7, 766261) I have discussed elsewhere 1 where such schools may be opened.
('59', 429, 1, 8, 766324) The conduct of caste Hindus would be generally tested by its reaction upon the mass mind of the Harijans.
('59', 429, 1, 9, 766430) If we have really changed towards them, they will feel the change in a thousand ways.
('59', 429, 1, 10, 766516) Our activity, I mean that of caste Hindus, will affect every department of their lives.
('59', 429, 1, 11, 766604) Even in the remotest village we are interdependent, so much so that this interdependence cannot be dissolved all at once, even if we desired it, without resulting in the greatest harm to the nation in general; and this interdependence, which is today that of slave and master, will never be corrected unless there is absolute religious equality.
('59', 429, 1, 12, 766950) It is a tremendous task, but as we progress towards the goal, the truth must dawn upon every caste Hindu that there is no half way house between abject slavery and perfect religious equality.
('59', 429, 1, 13, 767142) Hence my humble insistence upon temple entry without losing sight of the other things we must do.
('59', 429, 1, 14, 767240) My correspondent is bitter in discussing what he considers to be the extravagant management of the different organizations that have come under his lash.
('59', 429, 1, 15, 767394) As an expert organizer that I may claim to be, I have been generally guided by the rule that the cost of administration, that is, overhead charges, should never exceed 10% of the receipts— 5% being the ideal—the balance going to the cause which brought the organization into being.
('59', 429, 1, 16, 767676) I suggest this test to the Central Board and the Provincial Boards and all other independent Harijan organizations run by caste Hindus.
('59', 429, 1, 17, 767812) Let it not be said of us that we spend more on running the organizations than upon Harijans themselves.
('59', 429, 1, 18, 767916) Let us see

('59', 430, 1, 2, 768010) to it that, out of every Rs. 100 received as donation for the Harijan cause Rs. 90 go straight into the pockets of Harijans.
('59', 430, 1, 3, 768135) Therefore, our officials should be largely volunteers, never highly paid wherever paid service is required.
('59', 430, 1, 4, 768243) Wherever it is possible, we should get Harijans.
('59', 430, 1, 5, 768292) We should select candidates and train them.
('59', 430, 1, 6, 768336) The correspondent says that peons in the organizations inspected by him are not drawn from the Harijan ranks.
('59', 430, 1, 7, 768446) Let every organization for the service of Harijans introspect itself in the light of the criticism I have condensed and the suggestions I have made.
('59', 430, 1, 8, 768595) I know that the correspondent has painted the picture as black as he could.
('59', 430, 1, 9, 768671) He has refused to see the bright side.
('59', 430, 1, 10, 768710) I know something of Harijan service done by caste men in the different Provinces.
('59', 430, 1, 11, 768792) I know that there is a bright side to the work of the organizations referred to by my correspondent, but it was unnecessary for me to give the bright side.
('59', 430, 1, 12, 768948) It will take care of itself, if the organizations will take care of the dark side of the picture.
('59', 430, 1, 13, 769046) Most organizations have a capacity for self deception.
('59', 430, 1, 14, 769101) There is a tendency towards self glorification.
('59', 430, 1, 15, 769149) The Harijan exists for the sake of giving due prominence, therefore, to every bit of criticism that can be levelled against us by Harijan critics.
('59', 430, 1, 16, 769296) Harijan, 4 3 1933
('59', 430, 2, 17, 769314) 598. IS IT LOSS OF FAITH?
('59', 430, 3, 18, 769340) A co worker writes:
('59', 430, 4, 19, 769360) Some of us feel that your ‘fasting unto death’ may mean a conscious or unconscious loss of faith in the efficacy of non violence.
('59', 430, 4, 20, 769490) Can you enlighten us, who have derived our faith in non violence from you?
('59', 430, 4, 21, 769565) It is a flattering thought that some people have derived their faith in non violence from me.
('59', 430, 4, 22, 769659) But I would warn them that I may prove a broken reed at a critical juncture, if they have not assimilated the spirit of non violence and if it has not become an integral part of their life.
('59', 430, 4, 23, 769849) Faith in a man is a perishable quantity, for it vanishes like smoke when their idol does not come up to their expectations; but what gives us hope and courage in the nick of time is an undying faith in a cause or a principle, irrespective of persons from whom it is derived.
('59', 430, 4, 24, 770124) Having uttered this warning, let me say that my ‘fast unto death, was not due to loss of faith in non violence, but it was, as I have
('59', 431, 0, 1, 770258) 432 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 431, 1, 2, 770300) already said on more than one occasion, the last seal upon that faith.
('59', 431, 1, 3, 770371) Sacrifice of self even unto death is the final weapon in the hands of a non violent person.
('59', 431, 1, 4, 770463) It is not given to man to do more.
('59', 431, 1, 5, 770498) I, therefore, suggest to this co worker and all the others that in this religious battle against untouchability they must be prepared joyously even to ‘fast unto death, if such an urgent call comes to them.
('59', 431, 1, 6, 770705) If they feel that they are party to the September pledge 1 given unsolicited to the Harijans and if they cannot make good the pledge in spite of ordinary effort, how else, being non violent, will they propose to deliver the goods except by laying down their lives?
('59', 431, 1, 7, 770970) The Shastras tell us that, when people in distress prayed to God for relief and He seemed to have hardened His heart, they declared a ‘fast unto death’ till God had listened to their prayer.
('59', 431, 1, 8, 771161) Religious history tells us of those who survived their fast, because God listened to them but it tells us nothing of those who silently and heroically perished in the attempt to win the answer from a deaf God.
('59', 431, 1, 9, 771371) I am certain that many have died in that heroic manner, but without their faith in God and non violence being in the slightest degree diminished.
('59', 431, 1, 10, 771517) God does not always answer prayers in the manner we want Him to.
('59', 431, 1, 11, 771582) For Him life and death are one, and who is able to deny that all that is pure and good in the world persists because of the silent death of thousands of unknown heroes and heroines!

('59', 431, 4, 14, 771808) This is the substance of what a correspondent 2 writes in the course of a long letter: Some of us caste men tried and succeeded in having certain wells in some of the Bihar villages opened to the use of Harijans.
('59', 431, 4, 15, 772021) But the Brahmin pujaris nearby retorted by stopping the service in the village temple, and the local Brahmins threa tened to stop all religious services at shraddha 3, marriage and the like.
('59', 431, 4, 16, 772212) This frightened the simple villagers.
('59', 431, 4, 17, 772250) I feel tempted to offer satyagraha, but I desist lest I might do so in anger.
('59', 431, 4, 18, 772328) What would you advise in such cases?

('59', 432, 1, 2, 772598) Not long ago there was a similar case near Trichinopoly.
('59', 432, 1, 3, 772655) Dr. Rajan acted with decision.
('59', 432, 1, 4, 772686) Himself a Brahmin by caste and Shudra by right of service, he defied the orthodox Brahmins who had refused even to perform the funeral rights in the case of death in a reformer’s family.
('59', 432, 1, 5, 772873) My advice, therefore, is that there is no occasion in such cases for satyagraha.
('59', 432, 1, 6, 772954) Those who regard untouchability as a sin must be prepared to suffer all the hardships of boycott and the like as a part of the process of purification and penance.
('59', 432, 1, 7, 773118) In all humility they must learn to dispense with the outward form.
('59', 432, 1, 8, 773185) Anything done in the name of God and for His sake needs no support from an officiating priest, whether it is a death or a marriage or a shraddha.
('59', 432, 1, 9, 773331) Anybody can unite a couple in marriage by reciting the sacred mantras, whether it is Ramanama of any of the known formulae according to the tradition in which one has been brought up.
('59', 432, 1, 10, 773515) God is known not by His thousand names only but by millions of names.
('59', 432, 1, 11, 773585) Any name which comes from the heart and by which we can recognize Him is as good as any other or, rather, the best of all for us.
('59', 432, 1, 12, 773715) But these things can only be done by those who have the courage of their conviction, faith in themselves, faith in their cause and faith in a living God.
('59', 432, 1, 13, 773869) This is not a movement in which faint heartedness can be of any use.
('59', 432, 1, 14, 773938) Only workers with stout hearts and irreproachable character will be able to infect the villagers with their own strong convictions and enable them to do the right thing in the face of boycott or worse persecution.

('59', 432, 4, 17, 774193) March 4, 1933
('59', 432, 5, 18, 774207) MIRA, This is Saturday before prayer time 3.30 a.m.
('59', 432, 5, 19, 774259) No letter from you till Friday evening.
('59', 432, 5, 20, 774299) I put off even yesterday in the hope of getting your letter in the afternoon and still posting you something yesterday but that was not to be.
('59', 432, 5, 21, 774442) So each week your letter is getting later in coming.
('59', 432, 5, 22, 774495) But though I look forward to it I do not worry.
('59', 432, 5, 23, 774543) The letter writing is not a right of prisoners.
('59', 432, 5, 24, 774591) Therefore there is no deprivation.
('59', 432, 5, 25, 774626) What in ordinary life religion calls duty becomes or seems to be compulsion in the prison life.
('59', 432, 5, 26, 774722) But that is not the case with us.
('59', 432, 5, 27, 774756) We are in a way voluntary prisoners.
('59', 432, 5, 28, 774793) Therefore we may not feel
('59', 433, 0, 1, 774819) 434 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 433, 1, 2, 774861) the compulsion as such when a certain permission is withdrawn or is regulated in the manner suited to the authorities.
('59', 433, 1, 3, 774980) I can do without your letters if need be and you must train yourself to do likewise and feel happy 1. In a manner everybody trains himself to do without things when he cannot get them.
('59', 433, 1, 4, 775165) A follower of the Gita dharma trains himself to do without things with happiness 2 called equanimity in Gita language, for happiness of the Gita is not the opposite of unhappiness.
('59', 433, 1, 5, 775346) It is superior to that state.
('59', 433, 1, 6, 775376) The devotee of the Gita is neither happy nor unhappy.
('59', 433, 1, 7, 775430) And when that state is reached, there is no pain, no pleasure, no victory, no defeat, no deprivation, no possession.
('59', 433, 1, 8, 775547) Prison life is a life of privilege if we learn to practise the Gita teaching.
('59', 433, 1, 9, 775625) It is easier in the prison than outside.
('59', 433, 1, 10, 775666) For outside we have the opportunity of picking and choosing.
('59', 433, 1, 11, 775727) Hence we are not always able to test ourselves.
('59', 433, 1, 12, 775775) In the prison, there are various jarring occasions.
('59', 433, 1, 13, 775827) Are we able to bear them with equanimity?
('59', 433, 1, 14, 775869) If we are, it is well with us.
('59', 433, 1, 15, 775900) I have kept your letter of 19th February which I got after I had written my weekly letter.
('59', 433, 1, 16, 775991) You had Mridula in your party.
('59', 433, 1, 17, 776022) I hope she is quite well.
('59', 433, 1, 18, 776048) She was not quite strong and healthy.
('59', 433, 1, 19, 776086) Ba should look after her jaws.
('59', 433, 1, 20, 776117) Does she wear her teeth?
('59', 433, 1, 21, 776142) Does she take enough exercise?
('59', 433, 1, 22, 776173) Does she do any reading herself?
('59', 433, 1, 23, 776206) Does she get weekly letters or fortnightly?
('59', 433, 1, 24, 776250) I know last time she did not get several of my letters.
('59', 433, 1, 25, 776306) I do not know what happened to them.
('59', 433, 1, 26, 776343) This time I am anxious that she should get my letters.
('59', 433, 1, 27, 776398) So far as I am aware prison authorities had not withheld her letters.
('59', 433, 1, 28, 776468) I do propose to write to Dr. Saunders 3 about your history.
('59', 433, 1, 29, 776528) But whatever the history, there is only one treatment which I have mentioned to you.
('59', 433, 1, 30, 776613) There need be therefore no waiting for his report.
('59', 433, 1, 31, 776664) It would be interesting to know what he has to say.
('59', 433, 1, 32, 776716) Sunlight, simple food in which vitamins have not been destroyed and exercise in the open air will dissolve all glands and other affections.
('59', 433, 1, 33, 776856) Verrier has cried off the proposed marriage with Mary Gillett.
('59', 433, 1, 34, 776919) But his communications are not happy.
('59', 433, 1, 35, 776957) He is showing a very vulnerable spot in his character.

('59', 434, 5, 10, 777484) March 4, 1933
('59', 434, 6, 11, 777498) DEAR JANAKDHARI BABOO,
('59', 434, 7, 12, 777521) You were quite right in sending me your long letter.
('59', 434, 7, 13, 777574) You will see that one portion of your letter I have dealt with in the columns of the Harijan.
('59', 434, 7, 14, 777668) 1 I have purposely refrained from using your name.
('59', 434, 7, 15, 777719) You will have to lead the way by defying the priesthood yourself, and you will find, as I have found elsewhere, that the boycotting priests will immediately quiet down and want to perform the ceremonies, for they would not want to lose the income that they get from the performance of these ceremonies.
('59', 434, 7, 16, 778022) They proclaim the boycott today, because they think that thereby they will be able to get more money from frightened people, and you will find too that you will presently get reformers who will gladly officiate at these functions.
('59', 434, 7, 17, 778253) That was what Dr. Rajan was able to do.
('59', 434, 7, 18, 778293) Do please continue to write to me whenever you feel you have something to say to me.
('59', 434, 7, 19, 778378) As for your personal struggle, no prayashchitta is necessary except that you should resolutely live apart from your wife, and you will soon find you will be quite all right.
('59', 434, 7, 20, 778552) You must develop the will to enforce this resolution.
('59', 434, 7, 21, 778606) The other thing you ask is much more difficult.
('59', 434, 7, 22, 778654) You attain to ‘param’ i.e., truth, by constantly practising it.
('59', 434, 7, 23, 778718) The saying that a man becomes what he thinks is a scientific truth.
('59', 434, 7, 24, 778786) Here thinking does not mean the mental vapours.
('59', 434, 7, 25, 778834) It means perfect accord between thought, speech and deed, and when there is that completely, you are within sight of Truth.
('59', 434, 7, 26, 778958) I wonder if it is clear to you.

('59', 435, 8, 13, 779517) The difference between Malaviyaji and myself is as you properly say unfortunate, but since the difference was there it is as well that it has come out.

('59', 435, 13, 20, 779900) You were quite right in writing the letter.
('59', 435, 13, 21, 779944) The best appreciation I could show was to publish the relevant parts of it and to offer my own criticism.
('59', 435, 13, 22, 780050) I had prepared the article 2 for this week’s issue of the Harijan, but it had to stand aside for matters more urgent.
('59', 435, 13, 23, 780168) I hope however it will go in next week.

('59', 436, 1, 2, 780446) letter I will not repeat the argument just now.
('59', 436, 1, 3, 780494) The reference to Gurudev I have not given in the Harijan.
('59', 436, 1, 4, 780552) I know he has been specially tender towards me of late.
('59', 436, 1, 5, 780608) Perhaps Truth suffers through his reticence if he has absolutely strong and confirmed views on the question as your letter would suggest he has.
('59', 436, 1, 6, 780753) I should hold it to be a great tragedy if through the tenderness of friends, untruth had crept into my life or had passed current among the people.
('59', 436, 1, 7, 780901) If what I hold is truth, it must stand the light of fiercest criticism even of friends who have hitherto worked with me.
('59', 436, 1, 8, 781022) I have no end to serve but that of Truth.
('59', 436, 1, 9, 781064) If my defeat means victory of Truth, I would count that defeat itself as victory.
('59', 436, 1, 10, 781146) I do not regard my judgements as infallible and even though I may be right in 99 cases out of 100, I do not want to trade upon it and assume or expect other people to assume that the 100th judgement is also right.
('59', 436, 1, 11, 781360) I have for that reason called Gurudev the great sentinel, and I have always appreciated his warnings even when I have not been able to depart from my course by reason of his warnings.
('59', 436, 1, 12, 781544) They have put me on my mettle and made the .
('59', 436, 1, 13, 781589) people think and choose.
('59', 436, 1, 14, 781614) It is not good for individuals or nations to be under the hypnotic influence of any single person.
('59', 436, 1, 15, 781713) It is a golden cover that hides the face of Truth.
('59', 436, 1, 16, 781764) You may, if you like, read this to Gurudev, and if he is clear in his mind, after reading the article that you will see in a few days, that he has no doubt in his mind that I am in error, let him issue his warning by way either of a public statement or a letter addressed to me for publication.
('59', 436, 1, 17, 782059) But if he has any doubt I want the benefit of that doubt because I do not want the people to be confused.
('59', 436, 1, 18, 782165) As it is, on this temple entry question I do not hold the field undisputed.
('59', 436, 1, 19, 782241) They have all kinds of arguments put before them for examination.
('59', 436, 1, 20, 782307) I do not want Gurudev’s to be one of this crowd of arguments against the simple issue.
('59', 436, 1, 21, 782394) His must be an overpowering deliverance standing by itself in its strength and originality.
('59', 436, 1, 22, 782486) I am personally not quite sure that Gurudev agrees with you in your attitude, for Santiniketan has its own temple or church or mandir, whatever you like to call it.
('59', 436, 1, 23, 782651) Where two or three people gather together in a particular place in the name of God to offer worship, it becomes a temple.
('59', 436, 1, 24, 782773) In Santiniketan we have a humble but beautiful building where prayers are offered, incenses burnt and sermons given.
('59', 436, 1, 25, 782890) In Sabarmati we have no building, no walls, but the cardinal points are the walls, the sky is the roof and mother earth is the floor; nevertheless, the spot that has been selected for the morning and the evening prayers has all the essentials of a temple.

('59', 437, 4, 7, 783476) MY DEAR THADANI, Though I cannot immediately promote you to the rank of a privileged jester, your letter just enables you to be admitted as a candidate for that coveted service.
('59', 437, 4, 8, 783654) You have therefore every reason to persevere.
('59', 437, 4, 9, 783700) You have no reason to fear publicity.
('59', 437, 4, 10, 783738) When you have actually been admitted to that high order, whether you fear or covet publicity, it will be there.
('59', 437, 4, 11, 783850) You had only one English educated Indian seriously to tell you that untouchability has been from the beginning of time.
('59', 437, 4, 12, 783970) I discover these celebrities practically every day, and, if I was not a child of the Mother Gita all the fears that Sastri entertained would have been long ago realized in spite of the presence of a privileged jester.
('59', 437, 4, 13, 784188) But thank God, the Gita is a never failing mother, and what is more, she is immortal.

('59', 438, 1, 2, 784679) this work after my own fashion when I was 15 years old and, finding myself in the house of a prostitute 1 I discovered suddenly that God had deprived me at that time, to my shame as I then thought and later as I discovered to my great pleasure and the glory of God, of the animal instinct.
('59', 438, 1, 3, 784969) I knew then how man was misbehaving towards woman, and since then I have never allowed a single opportunity to pass by without making an effort to eradicate the evil.
('59', 438, 1, 4, 785136) I have written strongly against it, spoken against it still more strongly.
('59', 438, 1, 5, 785211) My private correspondence is filled with the same thing.
('59', 438, 1, 6, 785268) At the present moment my activities in that direction must be necessarily circumscribed.

('59', 438, 1, 8, 785441) In the Harijan I won’t be able to handle the problem directly.
('59', 438, 1, 9, 785504) The reason for it is obvious.
('59', 438, 1, 10, 785534) You have no need to apologize for being a foreigner doing this service.
('59', 438, 1, 11, 785606) When people realize that you have no other motive, but the simple motive of serving these fallen sisters of India and through their service also serving the fallen men of India, they will forget that you are a foreigner.

('59', 440, 1, 3, 787995) You have written about the duty of caste Hindus.
('59', 440, 1, 4, 788044) But please write and say what the Harijans should do under such circumstances.
('59', 440, 1, 5, 788123) A. The above three questions have been sent by a Harijan brother.
('59', 440, 1, 6, 788189) All the three are difficult questions.
('59', 440, 1, 7, 788228) As long as there are several sub castes among caste Hindus it is very difficult to abolish the different sub castes among Harijans.
('59', 440, 1, 8, 788360) But this much is true that if there is a great awakening among Harijans then they can march ahead by leaps and bounds, at once.
('59', 440, 1, 9, 788488) I should like to see a time when Harijans will be actually far ahead of the caste Hindus.
('59', 440, 1, 10, 788578) But the question here is about the present condition.
('59', 440, 1, 11, 788632) In the present circumstances, it can only be said that castes considered higher among the Harijans should attempt to mix with castes deemed lower.
('59', 440, 1, 12, 788779) For example, the Mahar 1 caste should mix with the Mang 2 caste; they should begin to eat together and intermarry.
('59', 440, 1, 13, 788894) The Mahars who mix in this way with the Mangs should be fearless and face whatever difficulties they might encounter.
('59', 440, 1, 14, 789012) The second question is common to all.
('59', 440, 1, 15, 789050) In this age of transition many occupations will vanish and new ones will crop up.
('59', 440, 1, 16, 789132) It has always been so.
('59', 440, 1, 17, 789155) The question of sewerage can never arise in villages, Only towns can have sewerage.
('59', 440, 1, 18, 789239) Scavengers are found in towns.
('59', 440, 1, 19, 789270) I imagine that where there is sewerage, some scavengers must lose their jobs.
('59', 440, 1, 20, 789348) It is the duty of the municipality to provide work for such unemployed scavengers.
('59', 440, 1, 21, 789431) My advice is that weaving or some such occupation should be learnt by the scavengers.
('59', 440, 1, 22, 789517) In Gujarat I noticed that scavengers who lost their jobs took to weaving.
('59', 440, 1, 23, 789591) There is no common remedy for all in this matter.
('59', 440, 1, 24, 789641) It varies with the individual.
('59', 440, 1, 25, 789672) The third question is very difficult.
('59', 440, 1, 26, 789710) It is implied in the question itself that Harijans are entirely helpless and frightened.
('59', 440, 1, 27, 789799) Under these circumstances, it can only be said that they should go to the police for help.
('59', 440, 1, 28, 789890) Dr. Ambedkar told me that since the police belong to higher castes, they do not assist and this is quite possibly true.
('59', 440, 1, 29, 790010) Therefore, it can only be said that where there is police indifference or opposition and where no help is offered by the caste Hindus and where the Harijans are not sufficiently strong, it is best to have patience.
('59', 440, 1, 30, 790225) The only consolation is that there are occasions in the life of every person and every community when there is no other course open except to

('59', 441, 1, 4, 790535) Therefore, if the Harijans can see no non violent way out of a difficulty, then they had better pray to God for help.

('59', 441, 11, 24, 791512) The field of social service is as wide as India itself, but it may not be an exaggeration to say that the centre of it is Harijan service; for, in serving the Harijans, the worker will meet with every conceivable social problem in a concentrated form and he will have to possess the best qualities.

('59', 442, 2, 3, 792062) March 5, 1933
('59', 442, 3, 4, 792076) MARY, Received your letter.
('59', 442, 4, 5, 792104) Your letters are never fault finding.
('59', 442, 4, 6, 792142) You need not therefore be afraid of writing as you feel, without any polish.
('59', 442, 4, 7, 792219) I want you to think aloud.
('59', 442, 4, 8, 792246) Polishing is often a concealment of thought.
('59', 442, 4, 9, 792291) If it is relevant thought, the concealment amounts to an untruth.
('59', 442, 4, 10, 792357) In ordinary life our speech is rarely 100 per cent truthful.
('59', 442, 4, 11, 792418) If you will go through the translation of all the verses we sing for the morning prayer you will perhaps find what you are craving for.
('59', 442, 4, 12, 792554) Only remember that Mother Earth, Mother Saraswati, etc., are all manifestations of God, even as Father God is a manifestation.
('59', 442, 4, 13, 792681) No one has described the whole of Him.
('59', 442, 4, 14, 792720) The test of your yarn is not at all bad.
('59', 442, 4, 15, 792761) The coolness of a room is never the same as the coolness right under the sky.
('59', 442, 4, 16, 792839) In London, I slept with the door and the window open but had the roof for fear of the rain coming down any moment.
('59', 442, 4, 17, 792954) But you must not try, so long as you have any fear.
('59', 442, 4, 18, 793006) I wonder if I answered your question [as to] when I began spinning.
('59', 442, 4, 19, 793074) I began it in 1919, i.
('59', 442, 4, 20, 793097) e., when I was 50. I know people who began after 60. You have therefore no cause whatever for despair.
('59', 442, 4, 21, 793200) And if it will give you comfort, know that I was a dunce.
('59', 442, 5, 22, 793258) BAPU [PS.] It is not necessary to fast whilst you are silent.
('59', 442, 5, 23, 793320) Begin first with a few hours.

('59', 443, 3, 4, 793581) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter.
('59', 443, 3, 5, 793623) I am now sending your letter to Dr. Bidhan Roy for such investigation as may be possible for him to undertake.With reference to your pamphlet, I have read it.
('59', 443, 3, 6, 793782) You will permit me to say that I regard it as unbalanced.
('59', 443, 3, 7, 793840) Such argument in it as is relevant has already been dealt with in the pages of the Harijan which you can easily secure, because there is a local sale of the paper.

('59', 444, 3, 5, 794750) DEAR FRIEND, Mirabai (Madeleine Slade) is, as you perhaps know, undergoing imprisonment under the Civil Disobedience policy of the Government of India.
('59', 444, 3, 6, 794902) Her health has latterly been a cause of some anxiety.
('59', 444, 3, 7, 794956) She tells me that you, as the family physician, attended at all her youthful illnesses and were present at an operation she had undergone for glands.
('59', 444, 3, 8, 795106) 1 If you have a record of her illnesses I would thank you to send me a copy for use when required.
('59', 444, 3, 9, 795205) I may mention that there is absolutely nothing serious about her health just now.
('59', 444, 3, 10, 795287) She has been removed to a better prison and has been feeling better also after her removal.
('59', 444, 3, 11, 795379) But as there was a fear at one time that she might have tubercular glands, by way of precaution I have asked you to give me what information you can about her previous condition.
('59', 444, 4, 12, 795558) Yours sincerely, DR.

('59', 445, 2, 3, 796138) March 5, 1933
('59', 445, 3, 4, 796152) DEAR SATISBABU, I have your letter, and I have also two copies of the Bengali Harijan.
('59', 445, 3, 5, 796239) I wish my knowledge of Bengali was such as to enable me to read what you have been writing.
('59', 445, 3, 6, 796331) Ghanshyamdas has heard me say that I am studying Bengali.
('59', 445, 3, 7, 796389) Unfortunately, that is untrue.
('59', 445, 3, 8, 796420) What I told him was that I was studying Urdu and that if I had the time I had a great longing for studying Bengali and reviving my knowledge of Tamil.
('59', 445, 3, 9, 796571) A study of Bengali, as you know, is an old dream.
('59', 445, 3, 10, 796621) It was about to materialize in 1914, but I had to abruptly leave London for India and the lessons which Mrinalini Devi was giving to me had to be suspended.
('59', 445, 3, 11, 796778) Therefore when Mahadev has read the paper 1 will send you what he has to say.
('59', 445, 3, 12, 796856) The cover is certainly attractive.
('59', 445, 3, 13, 796891) You will let me know what reception it has had from the public.
('59', 445, 3, 14, 796955) As for the articles to be sent in advance, there are tremendous difficulties, but I shall see what can be done.
('59', 445, 3, 15, 797067) I understand your position about vaccination.
('59', 445, 3, 16, 797113) Your faith will sustain you.
('59', 445, 3, 17, 797142) You will see how the report that you sent about the Bengali work was interwoven by Shastri into the “Week to Week” columns.
('59', 445, 4, 18, 797266) Have you noticed the ‘comedy of errors, that happened in connection with the information that Hemprabha had given me about Aroon’s father’s death?
('59', 445, 4, 19, 797413) When I read her letter, I could not believe my eyes.
('59', 445, 4, 20, 797466) There was nothing wrong with you.
('59', 445, 4, 21, 797500) You were Aroon’s [sic] father and yet the expression ‘Aroon’s father, was there right enough.
('59', 445, 4, 22, 797594) I read or showed it to the 9 Sardar, Mahadev and Chhaganlal, and we all came to the conclusion that it must be another Aroon whose father was dead, because later from the language used by Hemprabha it was clear that you were to have seen Aroon’s father before he died, but you and she were too late.
('59', 445, 4, 23, 797894) I had a vague recollection of Hemprabha having adopted a boy or girl, so I connected Aroon with this adoption, and yet there were not two Aroons to my knowledge.
('59', 445, 4, 24, 798056) Therefore my letter 2 to Hemprabha baldly referred to a strange Aroon’s father.

('59', 446, 1, 2, 798241) letter cleared the mystery.
('59', 446, 1, 3, 798269) And now comes Aroon’s postcard, but of course your letter itself was quite clear that it was your father who had died.
('59', 446, 1, 4, 798388) If I had remembered, as I should have remembered, that your father was still alive, I would at once have known that Hemprabha meant grandfather instead of father.
('59', 446, 1, 5, 798551) But at the time I read Hemprabha’s letter I had forgotten altogether that your father was still alive.
('59', 446, 1, 6, 798654) It was only your letter which revived the recollection.
('59', 446, 1, 7, 798710) I hope you and Hemprabha, Aroon and everybody who read my letter had a hearty laugh at my expense.
('59', 446, 1, 8, 798809) But if I had been there when my letter was received, I should have joined that hearty laughter, or perhaps called for a laughter at Hemprabha’s expense.
('59', 446, 1, 9, 798962) I am not writing separately to Aroon.
('59', 446, 1, 10, 799000) You will therefore share this portion with him.
('59', 446, 1, 11, 799048) I see that he is still not quite well.
('59', 446, 1, 12, 799087) And tell Aroon that I shall write to him when he has written to me the letter he has promised.

('59', 446, 6, 17, 799273) DEAR FRIEND,
('59', 446, 7, 18, 799286) I have read your letter of 24th February from beginning to end with greatest attention.
('59', 446, 7, 19, 799374) Whilst I acknowledge the great pains you have bestowed over the composition and the Sanskrit learning which you exhibit, you will permit me to say that I miss the application of that learning to the reality, and it has been a matter of very deep grief to me that in the contact I am having with so many learned sanatanists, hardly any one of them has touched the fundamental points I have raised.
('59', 446, 7, 20, 799771) I state them for you.
('59', 446, 7, 21, 799793) Of all those who appear as untouchables in the census figures, who are the untouchables by birth?
('59', 446, 7, 22, 799891) Where is the authority in the Vedas for regarding them as such?
('59', 446, 7, 23, 799955) And if there is none in the Vedas, call the later Shastras impose disabilities or create classes not contemplated by the Vedas?
('59', 446, 7, 24, 800083) What is there in the Shastras to justify the numerous disabilities which I have described in the pages of the Harijan and which are suffered by those who are classified as untouchables?

('59', 447, 3, 9, 800707) I was deeply grieved like you to see the A. P. report.
('59', 447, 3, 10, 800762) The interview was undoubtedly only for you, and I had no notion that Gopalan had taken it.
('59', 447, 3, 11, 800853) But not only did he take it, he never even showed it to me.
('59', 447, 3, 12, 800913) Hence the extremely bad form in which it has appeared.
('59', 447, 3, 13, 800968) It does not even accurately convey my opinion.
('59', 447, 3, 14, 801015) Nevertheless, I am quite satisfied there was no dishonourable conduct on Gopalan’s part.
('59', 447, 3, 15, 801104) It was a bona fide mistake.
('59', 447, 3, 16, 801132) I hope therefore you will dismiss from your mind all irritation against him.

('59', 449, 13, 21, 803733) NARMADA, You seem to have no regard for truth.
('59', 449, 13, 22, 803780) You did not write any letter yourself and you demand that I should write to you You did well in paying a visit to your home.
('59', 449, 13, 23, 803905) Now devote yourself completely to work Write to me regularly.

('59', 450, 3, 4, 804144) BHAISHRI MUNSHI, I got your postcard.
('59', 450, 3, 5, 804182) It seems that you are being weighed down by misfortunes.
('59', 450, 3, 6, 804239) But probably man cannot be tested except through suffering.
('59', 450, 3, 7, 804299) I had already given a ‘quick doctor’s’ advice to let Jagdish stay where he was if his health had deteriorated very much.
('59', 450, 3, 8, 804420) Your hand does not seem to have improved yet.

('59', 450, 9, 14, 804620) GANGABEHN, I am glad that you are released.
('59', 450, 9, 15, 804664) You did not get the second letter which I wrote to you, but I think they must have given it to you at the time you were released.
('59', 450, 9, 16, 804794) Write to me about your experiences in jail this time.
('59', 450, 9, 17, 804848) You have done right in accompanying Lakshmi.
('59', 450, 9, 18, 804893) Write to me about your experience in the Ashram together with your experience in jail.
('59', 450, 9, 19, 804980) And also tell me how your health was while in jail.
('59', 450, 9, 20, 805032) What did you read, and what did you think about?
('59', 450, 9, 21, 805081) And what work did you do?
('59', 450, 9, 22, 805107) the women prisoners here are quite well.
('59', 450, 9, 23, 805148) The Jail Superintendent often tells me in joke that, when you were here, all the other women prisoners wanted medicines form you, but now nobody asks for any medicine.
('59', 450, 9, 24, 805316) I replied to him, of course.
('59', 450, 9, 25, 805345) But you also may send your reply, if you wish.

('59', 451, 9, 15, 806027) Have we not made an agreement that you will not abuse her nor beat her?
('59', 451, 9, 16, 806099) To abuse or beat a weak woman ought to be regarded as a terrible form of violence.
('59', 451, 9, 17, 806182) Wake up, reform your ways, calm down.
('59', 451, 9, 18, 806220) If a person like you cannot exercise such self control, who else can we expect to observe ahimsa?

('59', 452, 3, 4, 806469) BOYS AND GIRLS, I got your letter.
('59', 452, 3, 5, 806504) It is violence to tear sheets from a notebook and use them for writing letters.
('59', 452, 3, 6, 806584) Do you understand this?
('59', 452, 3, 7, 806608) Don’t do it again.
('59', 452, 3, 8, 806627) If the secretary or the other office bearers show themselves unfit or if the members harass them, in either case our progress will be arrested.
('59', 452, 3, 9, 806771) When you grow up you will behave as you now do.
('59', 452, 3, 10, 806819) What you do not learn now you will never learn later.
('59', 452, 3, 11, 806873) I hope you do understand that.
('59', 452, 3, 12, 806904) Just as mangoes cannot grow on a babul tree, you are not likely to change suddenly after ten years if you cannot work unitedly or behave with self restraint.
('59', 452, 3, 13, 807062) You should, therefore, learn to manage your body in a proper manner.

('59', 452, 8, 17, 807225) March 6, 1933
('59', 452, 9, 18, 807239) PREMA, I am starting on this letter at five sharp (Silence Day).
('59', 452, 9, 19, 807304) Yours was the last letter I read from the Ashram post.
('59', 452, 9, 20, 807359) I have not been able to go beyond 75 counts with the slivers which you sent.
('59', 452, 9, 21, 807436) Yarn of 75 counts should be regarded as very much below the mark.
('59', 452, 9, 22, 807502) I have calculated the count on the basis of the figure you give for weight.
('59', 452, 9, 23, 807578) The scales here are not good enough for weighing with any minute accuracy.
('59', 452, 9, 24, 807653) I do believe, however, that if my hand was all right I would be able to go up to 100 counts.
('59', 452, 9, 25, 807746) What you write to me regarding Sushila is simply incompre hensible to me.
('59', 452, 9, 26, 807820) I am not aware of having ignored her in theleast.
('59', 452, 9, 27, 807870) She herself made me feel that there was no need to inquire after her or
('59', 452, 10, 28, 807942) 1 Literally, ‘Yeravda Temple’, that is, Yeravda Central Prison, where Gandhiji was imprisoned from January 4, 1932 to May 8, 1933. This place line is not reproduced in subsequent letters.

('59', 453, 1, 2, 808172) advise her.
('59', 453, 1, 3, 808184) So I did not ask her any detailed questions.
('59', 453, 1, 4, 808229) Tell her this.
('59', 453, 1, 5, 808244) How could I know that like you she also craved for a show of love and for compliments?
('59', 453, 1, 6, 808331) I ought to have known that your friend would be like you.
('59', 453, 1, 7, 808389) Isn’t that what you suggest?
('59', 453, 1, 8, 808418) But probably Sushila herself will not admit this.
('59', 453, 1, 9, 808468) Isn’t one Prema enough for me?
('59', 453, 1, 10, 808499) There are other Premas, of course, but they are all different from one another and from you.
('59', 453, 1, 11, 808592) However, I will be more careful in future.
('59', 453, 1, 12, 808635) How old is Vijaya?
('59', 453, 1, 13, 808654) How does she behave?
('59', 453, 1, 14, 808675) Train Lakshmi thoroughly.
('59', 453, 1, 15, 808701) I also suspect something from the fact that Durga’s boils cannot still be cured.
('59', 453, 1, 16, 808782) She used to write to me regularly, but she never writes now.
('59', 453, 1, 17, 808843) From that, too, I suspect that she is hiding something.
('59', 453, 1, 18, 808899) Inquire and find out if she is suffering from some other disease.
('59', 453, 1, 19, 808965) A diet of raw vegetables and dates is bound to help you to reduce your weight.
('59', 453, 1, 20, 809044) You should also include in it two and a half ounces of unboiled milk.
('59', 453, 1, 21, 809114) Among raw vegetables, you may eat tomatoes, radishes, carrots, lettuce, etc.
('59', 453, 1, 22, 809191) You should exclude salt.
('59', 453, 1, 23, 809216) You should take two or three lemons with water or with dates.
('59', 453, 1, 24, 809278) Probably it will be better to take it with water.
('59', 453, 1, 25, 809328) If, however, it sours your teeth you may not take it.
('59', 453, 1, 26, 809382) You can also mix soda bicarb with it.
('59', 453, 1, 27, 809420) I cannot discuss the question asked by Rajaji and others.
('59', 453, 1, 28, 809478) That would be violating truth.
('59', 453, 1, 29, 809509) It can be done when a suitable opportunity arises.
('59', 453, 1, 30, 809560) My writings, however, contain a reply to every doubt.
('59', 453, 1, 31, 809614) I will admit all the shortcomings of the Ashram which you may point out.
('59', 453, 1, 32, 809687) But you will help me better if you also suggest suitable remedies at the same time.
('59', 453, 1, 33, 809771) Even if, however, you cannot do that, I must have your criticism.
('59', 453, 1, 34, 809837) I use my brain as much as I can.
('59', 453, 1, 35, 809870) I know this: the Ashram’s shortcomings are not its own, but mine.
('59', 453, 1, 36, 809936) If the potter makes an ill shaped pot, is that the fault of the pot or of the potter?
('59', 453, 1, 37, 810022) I literally believe what I have said, and the shortcomings of the Ashram, therefore, are a measure of my ignorance.
('59', 453, 1, 38, 810138) But notwithstan ding its shortcomings, I like the Ashram, for I am not ready to say positively that I do not like myself.
('59', 453, 1, 39, 810260) I like myself in the measure that I do not feel the sense of “I”, and ceaselessly strive to overcome what still remains of that sense.

('59', 454, 3, 4, 810575) BHAI CHHOTUBHAI, I got your letter.
('59', 454, 3, 5, 810611) Indulgence in moderation is less harmful, but brahmacharya is the best.
('59', 454, 3, 6, 810683) The atman is not a body and can exist without the body, as God does.
('59', 454, 3, 7, 810752) That which is bodiless can have no need for sex gratification, and, therefore, one who has awakened from the state of ignorance also can have none.
('59', 454, 3, 8, 810900) If it is one’s dharma to shed ignorance, sex gratification is contrary to dharma and, therefore, harmful.
('59', 454, 3, 9, 811006) The earth is certainly ever alive, but man who is of earth is not.
('59', 454, 3, 10, 811073) He must perish.
('59', 454, 3, 11, 811089) I cannot say whether at present people are rising or falling, It seems to me to be a futile question.
('59', 454, 3, 12, 811191) It is certainly true that we have no strength of our own except what God gives us and we must, therefore, admit it.
('59', 454, 3, 13, 811307) He who has real humility has risen far above the man who is proud, for humility is truth and pride is falsehood.
('59', 454, 3, 14, 811420) One should not brush the teeth with a babul stick after a meal, but one must clean them with a finger and gargle well.
('59', 454, 3, 15, 811539) The future will show what relations you will maintain with the Ashram after your marriage.
('59', 454, 3, 16, 811630) It is needless to think of it Just now.
('59', 454, 3, 17, 811670) I cannot say that I immediately recognized you on reading your letter.
('59', 454, 3, 18, 811741) I cannot say that with regard to anybody.

('59', 455, 3, 4, 812230) PRABHUDAS, I have your letter.
('59', 455, 3, 5, 812261) I understand what you say about the girl.
('59', 455, 3, 6, 812303) I am not likely to be satisfied with any sort of girl for you.
('59', 455, 3, 7, 812366) Gomati had approved of her.
('59', 455, 3, 8, 812394) She believed that the girl did not belong to the modh sub caste.
('59', 455, 3, 9, 812459) The only point was that if an educated girl is desirable for a match, though rather grown up, she should be accepted and the objection on the ground of her being a Gujarati or belonging to the Bania caste, should be waived.
('59', 455, 3, 10, 812683) I have no intention whatever of doing anything without your approval.
('59', 455, 3, 11, 812753) You have not said in your letter anything about honey or the school.
('59', 455, 3, 12, 812822) Do they make honey there?
('59', 455, 3, 13, 812848) From what do they make it?
('59', 455, 3, 14, 812875) What is the quality of teaching?
('59', 455, 3, 15, 812908) Who are the people who are learning?
('59', 455, 3, 16, 812945) I hope you have not completely given up your writing work or your study, have you?
('59', 455, 3, 17, 813028) I do not want to burden you with any responsibility in Almora.
('59', 455, 3, 18, 813091) Let the Shail Ashram remain just a dharmashala 1 for the present.
('59', 455, 3, 19, 813157) We will see later what should be done.
('59', 455, 3, 20, 813196) I, too, would welcome keeping the Chandradutta brothers.
('59', 455, 3, 21, 813253) If they are good men, no harm will be done.
('59', 455, 3, 22, 813297) It would of course be good if Mahavirprasad accepts them.
('59', 455, 3, 23, 813355) I think it would not be proper to give a big salary for the care of the Shail Ashram.
('59', 455, 3, 24, 813441) But in this matter, too, Narandas will know better.

('59', 456, 3, 4, 813690) BHAI VIYOGI HARI, Your letter.
('59', 456, 3, 5, 813721) This issue 1 is better though there is still room for improvement.
('59', 456, 3, 6, 813788) It is not necessary to take everything from English nor is it necessary to translate in full all that is taken.
('59', 456, 3, 7, 813900) Some article may deserve full translation, another only a summary, yet another may be rejected; in brief, the Hindi readers should get all that is worth giving.
('59', 456, 3, 8, 814061) Items published in other journals too should be screened.
('59', 456, 3, 9, 814119) But sometimes those translations may be faulty.
('59', 456, 3, 10, 814167) For purity, simplicity and restraint our translation should read like original writing.
('59', 456, 3, 11, 814255) As for the translated items appearing in newspapers, they need not be included in Hindi Harijan if the translations are accurate.
('59', 456, 3, 12, 814385) I am arranging to send English articles in advance.
('59', 456, 3, 13, 814437) Satisbabu wants them and so does Ganesan.
('59', 456, 3, 14, 814479) I shall see what can be done.
('59', 456, 3, 15, 814509) Why do you not include articles by Hindi writers?
('59', 456, 3, 16, 814559) But they should not be mere essays.
('59', 456, 3, 17, 814595) They should contain either the views or arguments of some sanatanists and answers to them or a discussion of problems faced by the workers or an account of the hardships suffered by Harijans.
('59', 456, 3, 18, 814787) All the articles, in short, must be written with a view to solving the current and immediate problems.
('59', 456, 3, 19, 814890) An abstract of the activities in Provinces should be a must every time.
('59', 456, 4, 20, 814962) From now on I shall send everything care of The Hindustan Times.

('59', 456, 8, 24, 815115) March 7, 1933
('59', 456, 9, 25, 815129) DEAR FRIEND,
('59', 456, 10, 26, 815142) I thank you for your letter of the 26th ultimo and now your letter of the 3rd instant.
('59', 456, 10, 27, 815229) Owing to pressure of work in connection with the Harijan I have not been able to acknowledge your first letter earlier.
('59', 456, 10, 28, 815349) I have no ground whatsoever to dispute the facts which you

('59', 457, 1, 2, 815499) seem to remember so well.
('59', 457, 1, 3, 815525) Have you any recollection of the subscribers to the fund?
('59', 457, 1, 4, 815583) 1 If you have, and if you can send me their statements also, it completes for me the chain of evidence.
('59', 457, 1, 5, 815687) My only interest just now is to secure as much money as I can legitimately for Harijan work, and when I was told by Sjt.
('59', 457, 1, 6, 815808) Joshi that I had control over the money in question I was naturally pleased.
('59', 457, 1, 7, 815885) You may depend upon it however that if I could by any chance persuade you to let me have a say in the disposal of a purse that was supposed to be presented to me, it won’t be Sjt.
('59', 457, 1, 8, 816065) Joshi who would have the fund.
('59', 457, 1, 9, 816096) I could not even write to you this letter if there was the slightest political motive behind my investigation of the fund.
('59', 457, 1, 10, 816219) I thank you for reminding me that I had the honour of being your guest at the time of my visit 2 to Sangli and that the alleged presentation was only formal and was made under your roof.
('59', 457, 1, 11, 816406) Yours sincerely, SJT.

Chhapkhane had claimed that the fund in question was raised from selected contributors for starting a movement for uplift of ‘‘States’ subjects”, that the matter had been discussed with Gandhiji at the time and that he had asked the addressee to start the said movement and keep the money on his (addressee’s) responsibility.

('59', 458, 3, 4, 817408) DEAR BROTHER KESHAV, I have your letter and copy of your appeal.
('59', 458, 3, 5, 817473) As I take up your letter, Kakasaheb 1 is sitting by me and so I have asked him to see you, understand from you the scheme, see the brother who has had his training in the Ashram, and he would then advise me, after which I shall form my opinion and let you know.
('59', 458, 3, 6, 817735) As you know, Kakasaheb is a founder member and so he knows the evolution of spinning and weaving from the beginning.

('59', 458, 6, 10, 817983) March 7, 1933
('59', 458, 7, 11, 817997) MY DEAR RAMACHANDRA, I thank you for your exhaustive letter of the 4th instant.
('59', 458, 7, 12, 818077) I had entirely forgotten your stay at the Ashram.
('59', 458, 7, 13, 818127) Your letter is quite helpful.
('59', 458, 7, 14, 818157) left Poona on Saturday, the 4th instant.
('59', 458, 7, 15, 818198) Your presence is now quite unnecessary.
('59', 458, 7, 16, 818238) Perhaps by this time I know more about her than you do.
('59', 458, 7, 17, 818294) She has been much worse than you have described her to be.
('59', 458, 7, 18, 818353) She has led for years an utterly immoral and extravagant life and has been an utter stranger to truth.
('59', 458, 7, 19, 818456) She has made that confession to me and has also definitely promised that she would make that confession publicly before the world and she has also promised to turn over a new leaf and lead henceforth a truthful, chaste life, and to that end she would retire from all public activity and live a beggar’s life in Harijan quarters in the poorest possible style, living on charity, unknown to the world.
('59', 458, 7, 20, 818856) Whether she has the strength to carry out this promise or

('59', 459, 1, 3, 819095) Let’s hope that she has.
('59', 459, 1, 4, 819120) She thinks that she has that strength.
('59', 459, 1, 5, 819159) If she is sincerely desirous of leading this life, you will render her what help you can.
('59', 459, 1, 6, 819249) You are at liberty to show this letter to her and you will please tell me all about her from time to time.
('59', 459, 1, 7, 819356) From her talks with me she led me to understand that she had great regard for you, but that regard has very little value because she was leading an altogether false life when she entertained this regard for you.
('59', 459, 1, 8, 819568) Even here truth had not dawned upon her when she came, but if it has really come to her, it dawned slowly and unperceivably.
('59', 459, 1, 9, 819693) That of course is all the better.
('59', 459, 1, 10, 819727) Some of the young men at least who have surrounded her do not seem to have behaved well.

('59', 460, 5, 8, 821021) NARANDAS, Send Prabhavati the volume of Speeches.
('59', 460, 5, 9, 821071) She has written to tell me that she had asked for it but has not received it.
('59', 460, 5, 10, 821149) Probably you know Parachure Shastri.
('59', 460, 5, 11, 821186) He has once stayed in the Ashram.
('59', 460, 5, 12, 821220) He is suffering from leprosy, but the symptoms may be considered to have dried up now.
('59', 460, 5, 13, 821307) He is in jail and will be released on the 8th.
('59', 460, 5, 14, 821354) He is a good man, a man of renunciation.
('59', 460, 5, 15, 821395) He knows Sanskrit, is married, and has three children.
('59', 460, 5, 16, 821450) The children are foolish.
('59', 460, 5, 17, 821476) The wife is weak in the brain.
('59', 460, 5, 18, 821507) She had once been admitted to a lunatic asylum.
('59', 460, 5, 19, 821555) I think we should keep him.
('59', 460, 5, 20, 821583) Give him one room.
('59', 460, 5, 21, 821602) Kaka says he should be given Mirabehn’s room.
('59', 460, 5, 22, 821648) The wife will of course live in the women’s wing.
('59', 460, 5, 23, 821698) The children could be kept anywhere.
('59', 460, 5, 24, 821735) Parachure Shastri will observe the modern hygienic rules for lepers.
('59', 460, 5, 25, 821804) That is, he will not touch anyone and will keep his clothes separate.
('59', 460, 5, 26, 821874) It will be necessary to send his meals to his room.
('59', 460, 5, 27, 821926) Probably he will live on milk and fruit, or on a mixture of fresh milk and neem leaves.
('59', 460, 5, 28, 822014) He can do a great deal of work sitting in his room.
('59', 460, 5, 29, 822066) He will teach Sanskrit.
('59', 460, 5, 30, 822090) He can teach even Marathi there.
('59', 460, 5, 31, 822123) He will arrive there by the 10th or the 12th.
('59', 460, 5, 32, 822169) He will presently go to see his wife.
('59', 460, 5, 33, 822207) I will know from him what he intends to do if his wife is against his

('59', 460, 7, 35, 822419) 3 The letter does not bear the date of writing, but in his letter to addressee dated March 8, 1923, Gandhiji says: “I have replied to Parachure Shastri.
('59', 460, 7, 36, 822572) Everything will depend on your wire.” Vide “Letter to Narandas Gandhi”, 8 3 1933. Evidently, the wire expected by Gandhiji would be in reply to this letter.
('59', 460, 7, 37, 822729) Again, in his letter to the addressee dated March 10, 1933, Gandhiji says, “ I just received your wire about Parachure Shastri.
('59', 460, 7, 38, 822857) I had been waiting for it before asking him to go there.” Ibid.

('59', 461, 1, 2, 822963) joining the Ashram.
('59', 461, 1, 3, 822983) He spins a great deal.
('59', 461, 1, 4, 823006) He has spun quite a lot in the jail.
('59', 461, 1, 5, 823043) He will spin there, too.
('59', 461, 1, 6, 823068) He was in fact a teacher in Chinchavad.
('59', 461, 1, 7, 823108) I do not think I have any further suggestion to make.
('59', 461, 1, 8, 823162) I take it that no one will take fright by this news.
('59', 461, 1, 9, 823215) Leprosy does not spread through the air.
('59', 461, 1, 10, 823256) Personally, I doubt if it is contagious.
('59', 461, 1, 11, 823297) In our country, lepers freely move about everywhere.
('59', 461, 1, 12, 823350) But we should observe the prohibitation about physical contact with a leper since that would be the right thing for us to do.
('59', 461, 1, 13, 823476) We cannot completely ignore modern science.
('59', 461, 1, 14, 823520) Shastri himself willingly observes that prohibition.
('59', 461, 1, 15, 823573) If he employs the remedies I have suggested, he may even be cured of his leprosy.
('59', 461, 1, 16, 823655) I have assumed that you yourself will not be reluctant to take him in.
('59', 461, 1, 17, 823726) If, however, you are, send me a telegram.
('59', 461, 1, 18, 823768) Ask the Managing Committee, too.
('59', 461, 1, 19, 823801) It is better to consult the other permanent inmates of the Ashram as well.
('59', 461, 1, 20, 823876) In fact I feel that it is my dharma to ascertain the opinion of every member in this matter.
('59', 461, 1, 21, 823969) I took this step only after all of us here unanimously agreed on it.
('59', 461, 1, 22, 824038) But I do not worry about it.
('59', 461, 1, 23, 824067) I felt it is to be my clear dharma to take him in.
('59', 461, 1, 24, 824118) He had in fact arrived with the purpose of living in the Ashram but had to leave because his wife was against it.
('59', 461, 1, 25, 824232) I think we cannot reject him.
('59', 461, 1, 26, 824262) However, there may be room for difference of opinion in this matter.
('59', 461, 1, 27, 824331) Since he had left the Ashram once, we cannot say without further deliberation that it is our dharma to take him back again.
('59', 461, 1, 28, 824455) Hence, on getting this letter, think over the matter.
('59', 461, 1, 29, 824509) First yourself, then the Committee, and after that the rest.
('59', 461, 1, 30, 824570) If your own view is against taking him in, I should not send him there, nor if the Committee is against it, nor if the old time members are against it.
('59', 461, 1, 31, 824722) I would not consider it essential to seek the consent of those who have joined the Ashram only for a short period.
('59', 461, 1, 32, 824837) However, it would be proper to discuss the matter with all the members.
('59', 461, 1, 33, 824909) I feel that I have abused the freedom which I obtained from you.
('59', 461, 1, 34, 824974) Such things come naturally to me, but I have no right, without the co workers’ consent to send anyone who might be a burden on them.
('59', 461, 1, 35, 825107) I followed the same rule at Phoenix.
('59', 461, 1, 36, 825144) Once, when I was practicing there, someone suffering from a dangerous disease turned up and I made Ba nurse him.
('59', 461, 1, 37, 825257) I am nearing the end of my life doing such things but have still not changed my ways.
('59', 461, 1, 38, 825343) That is, I act on the assumption that the co workers, particularly those who are very close to me, will as a matter of course do what I do.
('59', 461, 1, 39, 825483) Let us believe and hope that this will prove to be my last misdeed.
('59', 461, 1, 40, 825551) I will settle the matter perfectly well with Parachure Shastri.
('59', 461, 1, 41, 825615) Hence nobody should come to a decision on the basis of my assurance to him.
('59', 461, 1, 42, 825691) After considering the matter
('59', 462, 0, 1, 825720) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 463
('59', 462, 1, 2, 825765) independently and examining the Ashram’s dharma in this case send me a telegram whether thedecision is ‘yes’ or ‘no’.
('59', 462, 1, 3, 825883) Let no one believe that I will be shocked, whatever the decision.
('59', 462, 1, 4, 825949) I had expected that I would have to give but one sheet of paper to this subject, but now it seems that I would instead be giving five.
('59', 462, 1, 5, 826084) I went on writing as ideas came to me one after another.
('59', 462, 1, 6, 826141) In the matter of observing one’s dharma, taking a decision in a hurry is harmful and ought to be avoided.
('59', 462, 1, 7, 826247) It implies self conceit.
('59', 462, 1, 8, 826272) You will see from this something of the present state of my mind.
('59', 462, 1, 9, 826338) My fitness to think about anything except what relates to Harijan service seems to be fast leaving me.
('59', 462, 1, 10, 826441) To think about other things or to do anything or speak about anything else has become painful to me.
('59', 462, 1, 11, 826542) I am going through painful experiences which I find impossible to describe.
('59', 462, 1, 12, 826618) Even if I wished to describe them, I have no time to do so.
('59', 462, 1, 13, 826678) But no more of this now.
('59', 462, 1, 14, 826703) I feel perfectly at ease in pouring out my heart to you.
('59', 462, 1, 15, 826760) I believe you have the capacity to respond to such things.
('59', 462, 1, 16, 826819) If you have followed all I have said and wish to give the letter to others to read, I will have no objection.
('59', 462, 1, 17, 826929) If you feel that what I have written is strange, keep the letter with you after reading it.
('59', 462, 1, 18, 827021) I will explain it if we meet some day.
('59', 462, 1, 19, 827060) What I have said is nothing mysterious.
('59', 462, 1, 20, 827100) It is easy enough to understand, but it gives a glimpse into what agony one, who unswervingly follows the path of dharma, has to endure.
('59', 462, 1, 21, 827237) I do feel that if someone who has not associated himself with my life were to read this, it would do much harm.
('59', 462, 1, 22, 827349) Tell Parasaram firmly what your decision is.
('59', 462, 1, 23, 827394) I am writing to him.
('59', 462, 1, 24, 827415) If he wants to leave despite your being straightforward in dealing with him, let him do so.
('59', 462, 1, 25, 827507) If he wishes to stay in spite of it, no objection need be made.
('59', 462, 1, 26, 827571) There is no room for charity in the sphere of dharma.
('59', 462, 1, 27, 827625) It would be easy to acquiesce in it if we transgress the proper limit of ahimsa.
('59', 462, 1, 28, 827706) But it becomes difficult to do so when in the name of ahimsa one shows undeserved compassion and is thereby guilty of a subtle form of violence.
('59', 462, 1, 29, 827851) Just as we do not indulge an invalid’s fancies so also we need not indulge the fancies of a person who violates the rules.
('59', 462, 1, 30, 827974) This is the way to put an end to Parasaram’s noisy complaints.
('59', 462, 1, 31, 828037) I think it will be difficult to arrange for Kusum’s trip to Almora.
('59', 462, 1, 32, 828105) At present, there are just no such facilities there.
('59', 462, 1, 33, 828158) I think it will be difficult to look after her there.
('59', 462, 1, 34, 828212) We cannot put the burden of doing so on Prabhudas, nor on Navin.
('59', 462, 1, 35, 828277) If her disease gets aggravated, who will look after her there?
('59', 462, 1, 36, 828340) It might be possible to send her either to Deolai
('59', 463, 0, 1, 828390) 464 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 463, 1, 2, 828432) or Matheran.
('59', 463, 1, 3, 828445) Whether or not she can be sent to Deolali, will have to be considered.
('59', 463, 1, 4, 828516) I do not think it proper for the whole family to go.
('59', 463, 1, 5, 828569) Beyond this my brain refuses to work just now.
('59', 463, 1, 6, 828616) I have already written to you about Lakshmi.
('59', 463, 1, 7, 828661) Lakshmidas will certainly come there.
('59', 463, 1, 8, 828699) Perhaps Devdas also will come.
('59', 463, 1, 9, 828730) Rajaji and Shankerlal are here at present.
('59', 463, 1, 10, 828773) BAPU [PS.] Monday, 5.25 One thing was left out in the letter for the children.
('59', 463, 1, 11, 828852) Some of them write to me to say that they have got tired of the agricultural work.
('59', 463, 1, 12, 828935) Tell them that this does not become them.
('59', 463, 1, 13, 828977) A duty once undertaken cannot be abandoned.
('59', 463, 1, 14, 829021) Even music tires one so long as one has not learnt it well.
('59', 463, 1, 15, 829081) Those who have learnt agricultural work well, do not give it up.
('59', 463, 1, 16, 829146) If agricultural work were not interesting, millions in the world would not engage themselves in it.
('59', 463, 1, 17, 829246) It does require hard work, but hard work is interesting, not indolence.
('59', 463, 1, 18, 829318) Moreover, the hard work is only physical.
('59', 463, 1, 19, 829360) But our bodies love ease and comfort and therefore we avoid hard work and in consequence suffer from diseases.
('59', 463, 1, 20, 829471) I therefore hope that the children will not tire of agricultural work.
('59', 463, 1, 21, 829542) Besides, the mother Gita also teaches us that it is in doing our duty that we find pleasure and agricultural work is one of our duties.
('59', 463, 1, 22, 829678) I have looked into the result of the yarn test competition.
('59', 463, 1, 23, 829738) It is disappointing.
('59', 463, 1, 24, 829759) Only one sample bears the mark ‘excellent’.
('59', 463, 1, 25, 829803) The mark against two is ‘bad’.
('59', 463, 1, 26, 829834) All other samples fall short in both respects.
('59', 463, 1, 27, 829881) This defect must be remedied.
('59', 463, 1, 28, 829911) Ask those whose yarns have gone through the test and the others also, to be vigilent.
('59', 463, 1, 29, 829997) Spinning good quality yarn that is even and strong, requires nothing more than careful attention.
('59', 463, 1, 30, 830095) If the sliver is of inferior quality, the yarn may fall short in respect of .
('59', 463, 1, 31, 830173) 1 but it will certainly not be uneven or weak.
('59', 463, 1, 32, 830220) I still consider the count of the samples low.
('59', 463, 1, 33, 830267) The quality of slivers is likely to be at fault in that.
('59', 463, 1, 34, 830324) It does not matter if we produce a smaller quantity of slivers and yarn, but what we do produce must be of the finest quality.
('59', 463, 1, 35, 830451) Pay attention to this subject and induce others to do the same.

('59', 464, 1, 2, 830815) 643. LETTER TO F. MARY BARR AND DUNCAN GREENLEES
('59', 464, 2, 3, 830864) March 8, 1933
('59', 464, 3, 4, 830878) MARY AND DUNCAN, I like your letter very much indeed.
('59', 464, 3, 5, 830932) Before I argue to the contrary, let me say what I have told Narandas and I think I made clear to both of you, that you should not be treated as the other learners who come to the Ashram, that you should take only such part in the Ashram work as you like and can digest and that you should use your time as may seem most profitable to you from your own standpoint.
('59', 464, 3, 6, 831296) Now for my own opinion.
('59', 464, 3, 7, 831320) The Ashram is a place where the idea is to enforce literally the maxim ‘to labour is to pray’.
('59', 464, 3, 8, 831415) This labour was interpreted by Thoreau and Tolstoy to mean physical labour and Tolstoy adopted Bondaref’s maxim of bread labour being God’s law for all mankind.
('59', 464, 3, 9, 831576) I read the same thing in the third chapter of the Gita.
('59', 464, 3, 10, 831632) I have tested the truth of the interpretation in my own life and in the lives of many companions and I have felt that our lives have been incomplete and unsatisfying exactly to the extent that we have failed to carry out the interpretation in practice.
('59', 464, 3, 11, 831885) Therefore I would say that, so long as the routine of the Ashram appears to be a slavish following of it, the spirit of tile Ashram is not imbibed.
('59', 464, 3, 12, 832033) I confess unhesitatingly that so few have imbibed the spirit.
('59', 464, 3, 13, 832095) Many follow the routine mechanically and, therefore, slavishly.
('59', 464, 3, 14, 832159) I do not grumble over the mechanical following, because even that is better than people idling away their time and I am not without hope that even those who are mechanically following the routine will some day detect the spirit and the beauty behind it.
('59', 464, 3, 15, 832413) So many Englishmen and women, especially missionaries, make, in my opinion, the tremendous mistake of directing the activity of others without themselves taking a direct part in it.
('59', 464, 3, 16, 832595) They, therefore, remain untouched by the activity itself and often become blind guides.
('59', 464, 3, 17, 832683) As I am dictating this, illustrations from life crowd in upon my mind.
('59', 464, 3, 18, 832754) I would, therefore, say that if you can appreciate and understand the spirit of my remarks and feel the truth of them, then follow the routine patiently, intelligently, whole heart edly, till it becomes a part of your nature, lies light upon your mind and seems to speak to you its message.
('59', 464, 3, 19, 833045) Then, but not tillthen, are you really able to write anything serious for public service.
('59', 464, 3, 20, 833135) Not even every good thought is worth giving to the world unless it is repeatedly tested on the anvil of experience.
('59', 464, 3, 21, 833251) All true labour is both contagious and

('59', 465, 1, 3, 833344) I wonder if I have driven my meaning home.
('59', 465, 1, 4, 833387) If I have not, you must reject all my argument without the slightest hesitation and do exactly as you feel you should, so as to get the best out of your experience of the Ashram.

('59', 466, 3, 5, 835012) Your letter is going in this week, but I would like you to let me have the details showing how the disbursements were made.
('59', 466, 3, 6, 835136) As to the reply received by you from the Government regarding the supply of Harijan to prisoners, I must not deal with it through the Harijan.

('59', 466, 6, 12, 835441) March 8, 1933
('59', 466, 7, 13, 835455) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter and I am glad you have written to me.
('59', 466, 7, 14, 835534) I wish you would care to read all the numbers of the Harijan and I think that most of your doubts will be solved.
('59', 466, 7, 15, 835648) You will find in them that I have unhesitatingly said that all that is bad about varnashrama and caste should be wholly removed.
('59', 466, 7, 16, 835777) Temple entry is certainly coming much sooner than you expect.
('59', 466, 7, 17, 835839) It is the centre of reform because it would be a visible sign to the millions that untouchability is gone.
('59', 466, 7, 18, 835946) Therefore we must prosecute the reform whether the vast mass of caste Hindus come round or not.
('59', 466, 7, 19, 836042) Anti untouchability leagues are, I think, working satisfactorily.
('59', 466, 7, 20, 836108) A great deal is being done by them for the educational advancement

('59', 467, 1, 5, 836731) But I am writing for fuller particulars.
('59', 467, 1, 6, 836772) If you were to start the leagues and the Birla Committee 1 were to furnish the funds, you won’t call that self reliance.
('59', 467, 1, 7, 836893) As a matter of fact, what you need is not money but men who having received education would take it to the humbler Harijans.
('59', 467, 1, 8, 837018) My advice to the Harijan youths, therefore, is to take up the reform energetically among the poorest.
('59', 467, 1, 9, 837120) I do not know the effect of the Madras Services Commission.
('59', 467, 1, 10, 837180) You will perhaps enlighten me on the point, but Harijan graduates and other highly educated Harijans have limitless scope for serving fellow Harijans.
('59', 467, 1, 11, 837331) If there is no Telugu newspaper specially devoted to Harijans, I suppose it is because there are very few literate Harijans.
('59', 467, 1, 12, 837456) Before, therefore, you think of starting a paper, all the educated Harijans should spread themselves among the illiterate Harijans and impart instruction to them.
('59', 467, 1, 13, 837619) Every educated Harijan should, therefore, become a walking newspaper, and this you can supplement by issuing leaflets from time to time as they may be demanded.
('59', 467, 1, 14, 837780) Please keep yourself in touch with me.

('59', 467, 5, 20, 837967) NARANDAS, I got your big packet of mail.
('59', 467, 5, 21, 838008) My views about the teaching of English, it may be said, have changed to a certain extent.
('59', 467, 5, 22, 838098) I feel that the older women in the Ashram should be permitted to learn what they wish to.
('59', 467, 5, 23, 838188) They feel their deficiency at every step, and particularly, in our circumstances, their

('59', 468, 0, 1, 838317) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 469
('59', 468, 1, 2, 838362) ignorance of English.
('59', 468, 1, 3, 838384) They don’t mind being ignorant of arithmetic nor do they mind their indifferent Gujarati, but they feel unhappy that they don’t know English.
('59', 468, 1, 4, 838526) Our connections with Englishmen will continue, ought to continue, and, therefore, we shall also continue to use the English language.
('59', 468, 1, 5, 838660) Hence the women feel that if they know a little English, they will be able to use it every now and then.
('59', 468, 1, 6, 838765) This argument is not altogether tenable, but there is enough truth in it to make them wish to learn English.
('59', 468, 1, 7, 838874) It is certainly not immoral to learn English.
('59', 468, 1, 8, 838920) I think that, if the women do not feel interested in any other subject, it would be good to teach them even English to make them study minded.
('59', 468, 1, 9, 839063) It is desirable that the older women should become interested in study, no matter how.
('59', 468, 1, 10, 839150) It is also desirable that they should increase their knowledge.
('59', 468, 1, 11, 839214) I, therefore, think that we should provide whatever facility we can to any older woman who may wish to learn English.
('59', 468, 1, 12, 839332) Please point out to me any weakness that you may see in this reasoning.
('59', 468, 1, 13, 839404) I will try to explain again.
('59', 468, 1, 14, 839433) I see from Kikabhai’s letter that a large crowd of Harijans will be attending Lakshmi’s wedding.
('59', 468, 1, 15, 839530) I think that Jamna and you are the right persons to give away the bride.
('59', 468, 1, 16, 839603) I hope Jamna does not harbour the prejudice of untouchability in her heart.
('59', 468, 1, 17, 839679) Don’t make the Harijans who may attend sit apart from the others.
('59', 468, 1, 18, 839745) Since their proportion will be large enough for the gathering, serve them some fruit as refresh ment, as I have suggested.
('59', 468, 1, 19, 839868) I suggest copra and raisins.
('59', 468, 1, 20, 839897) If possible, I will write something to be read out to the assembled guests and en close it with this letter.
('59', 468, 1, 21, 840006) 1 You will have to give some dresses to Lakshmi as a gift from the Ashram.
('59', 468, 1, 22, 840081) Think over this.
('59', 468, 1, 23, 840098) If you can, see Ba and ask her advice.
('59', 468, 1, 24, 840137) I should be happy if she gives one of her saris, a new one or an almost new one.
('59', 468, 1, 25, 840218) If she has preserved any jewellery, she may give some of it too.
('59', 468, 1, 26, 840283) Tell the Superintendent that you wish to see her specially for this reason.
('59', 468, 1, 27, 840359) If he permits you, well and good, if he does not, don’t mind.
('59', 468, 1, 28, 840421) Discuss with the women this question of what to give to Lakshmi.
('59', 468, 1, 29, 840486) See that we omit to do nothing which would be proper on such an occasion.
('59', 468, 1, 30, 840560) I will write to you again if I think of anything more.
('59', 468, 1, 31, 840615) You can ignore any of my suggestions which you don’t think appropriate.
('59', 468, 1, 32, 840687) I have replied to Parachure Shastri.

('59', 469, 1, 4, 840902) They have not seen me yet.
('59', 469, 1, 5, 840929) Gangabehn will not be able to do so.
('59', 469, 1, 6, 840966) Sharda will see me on Saturday if she is here on that day.
('59', 469, 1, 7, 841025) You did the right thing in keeping Lakshmi’s younger sister with Anasuyabehn.

('59', 469, 2, 14, 841365) She lives on milk and fruit.
('59', 469, 2, 15, 841394) For some time she must remain here.
('59', 469, 2, 16, 841430) You may ask Lakshmidas about the remedies which are being tried for her.
('59', 469, 2, 17, 841503) They will be useful to others, too.
('59', 469, 2, 18, 841539) It cannot be said, though, that they will agree with everyone.
('59', 469, 2, 19, 841602) But they will certainly do no harm.
('59', 469, 2, 20, 841638) I have no fear about your health so long as your diet includes milk and curds.
('59', 469, 2, 21, 841717) But I should certainly like you to exclude gram from it.
('59', 469, 2, 22, 841774) It makes the mental work you are doing more difficult.
('59', 469, 2, 23, 841829) The best food for mental workers is milk and fruit.
('59', 469, 2, 24, 841881) If you eat uncooked cabbage, it should be tender.
('59', 469, 2, 25, 841931) But this is not necessary if you eat it boiled.
('59', 469, 2, 26, 841979) It would be better if you drink milk without boiling it.
('59', 469, 2, 27, 842036) Jamna should take sun bath, get her body massaged with oil, do pranayama systematically and, for food, drink milk and eat papaya, raisins and, if she wishes, some vegetable.
('59', 469, 2, 28, 842210) I believe she will be all right if she restricts her diet to these things.

('59', 469, 4, 31, 842422) March 8, 1933 I feel a little unhappy that neither Ba nor I will be present in the Ashram on the occasion of the wedding of Lakshmi and Maruti 3, but I think that is ignorant love.
('59', 469, 4, 32, 842603) One should feel happy wherever devotion to dharma may make it necessary for one to be.
('59', 469, 4, 33, 842690) Since one who
('59', 469, 5, 34, 842704) 1 Lakshmi’s parents.

('59', 470, 1, 2, 842931) follows dharma should never wish that things should be otherwise than they are, he can have no cause to feel unhappy.
('59', 470, 1, 3, 843049) Moreover, when so many elders and friends, men and women, will be assembling to give their blessings, Ba’s presence or mine should not be considered at all essential.
('59', 470, 1, 4, 843216) Lakshmi was of course eager that Ba and I should be present at her wedding.
('59', 470, 1, 5, 843292) So was Chi.
('59', 470, 1, 6, 843304) Maruti.
('59', 470, 1, 7, 843312) I could understand their desire.
('59', 470, 1, 8, 843345) But all of us felt that the marriage should take place without delay, and hence I advised both the bride and the bridegroom to have the wedding as soon as possible and they accepted my advice.
('59', 470, 1, 9, 843538) Lakshmi has been brought up in the Ashram since her childhood.
('59', 470, 1, 10, 843601) But we have not been able to educate and train her as well as the Ashram and I would have liked to do.
('59', 470, 1, 11, 843704) We did not, therefore, think it desirable to keep a girl in the bloom of youth unmarried for very long after betrothal.
('59', 470, 1, 12, 843824) The fact that Chi.
('59', 470, 1, 13, 843843) Lakshmi is getting married does not mean that her education will stop.
('59', 470, 1, 14, 843914) I regard Maruti as a very worthy young man.
('59', 470, 1, 15, 843958) He is a man of self control.
('59', 470, 1, 16, 843987) He has received training at the hands of Bhai Lakshmidas and Velabehn.
('59', 470, 1, 17, 844058) He realizes the responsibility he is undertaking.
('59', 470, 1, 18, 844108) He will not only be a husband to Lakshmi, but will also be a friend and teacher to her.
('59', 470, 1, 19, 844196) There can be no doubt that, if this marriage is successful, it will benefit both Harijans and Hinduism a great deal.
('59', 470, 1, 20, 844313) Looked at from this point of view, this marriage is of great importance and makes the responsibility of both correspondingly greater.
('59', 470, 1, 21, 844447) Maruti and Chi.
('59', 470, 1, 22, 844463) Lakshmi were betrothed some years ago.
('59', 470, 1, 23, 844502) It was a big problem for the Ashram to whom Lakshmi should be married.
('59', 470, 1, 24, 844573) We thought that, having regard to the training she had received in the Ashram, she would be happy only if she got a partner who had received a similar training.
('59', 470, 1, 25, 844734) The Ashram believes in the principle of varnashrama and tries to follow it as well as it can.
('59', 470, 1, 26, 844828) I cannot speak for all, but I have often stated that I myself believe that in the present age all Hindus can, and do, belong to one varna only.
('59', 470, 1, 27, 844972) If we wish to revive the varnashrama system, we shall have to start with a clean slate.
('59', 470, 1, 28, 845060) This being my view, it was my duty to find a suitable husband for Lakshmi.
('59', 470, 1, 29, 845135) Velabehn came to my help and suggested Maruti’s name.
('59', 470, 1, 30, 845189) Lakshmidas also liked the idea.
('59', 470, 1, 31, 845221) I put the suggestion to Lakshmi, and she, too, accepted it.
('59', 470, 1, 32, 845281) Her father also gave his consent and the two were betrothed.
('59', 470, 1, 33, 845342) In my opinion all that we did was in conformity with dharma.
('59', 470, 1, 34, 845403) I regard marriage too as a protective hedge
('59', 471, 0, 1, 845447) 472 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 471, 1, 2, 845489) for dharma, and we should hope that the bride and the bridegroom also will regard it in the same light.
('59', 471, 1, 3, 845593) This marriage has no connection with the present movement.
('59', 471, 1, 4, 845652) Mixed marriages like this one are in no way a part of the movement for the removal of untouchability.
('59', 471, 1, 5, 845754) This marriage is a recognition of the point of view of one who believes in all the various ideals of the Ashram.
('59', 471, 1, 6, 845867) I hope that no one will misunderstand its significance because it is taking place at the present time when the movement for removal of untouchability is going on and because it is inspired by one who is the chief leader of that movement.
('59', 471, 1, 7, 846105) I do not hold up this marriage as an example for anybody to follow.
('59', 471, 1, 8, 846173) I regard marriage as a matter of the parents’ and their children’s free will.
('59', 471, 1, 9, 846251) I believe that there is ample support for this view in Hinduism.
('59', 471, 1, 10, 846316) However, it has no connection with the problem of the removal of untouchability.
('59', 471, 1, 11, 846397) The question belongs to another field of reform in Hinduism.

('59', 471, 6, 17, 846642) The following resolution was adopted on behalf of what are known as caste Hindus by a meeting of their representatives from all India held at Bombay under the presidentship of Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya on 25th September, 1932. 2
('59', 471, 7, 18, 846873) This Conference resolves that henceforth, amongst Hindus, no one shall be regarded as an untouchable by reason of his birth and those who have been so regarded hitherto will have the same rights as the other Hindus in regard to the use of public wells, public roads and other public institutions.

The constitution was finally adopted with minor changes on January 2, 1935. Gandhiji says in the above letter that the draft was prepared by Mahadev Desai.
('59', 471, 8, 21, 847552) The portions of the original draft left after Gandhiji had revised it are underlined.

('59', 472, 2, 3, 847861) It is further agreed that it shall be the duty of all Hindu leaders to secure, by every legitimate and peaceful means, an early removal of all social disabilities now imposed by custom upon the so called untouchable classes including the bar in respect of admission to temples.
('59', 472, 2, 4, 848139) This was followed up by a public meeting convened by the Hindu leaders from all parts of the country and held in Bombay on the 30th September, under the presidentship of Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, at which following resolution among others was passed:
('59', 472, 3, 5, 848393) This public meeting of the Hindus resolves that an All India Antiuntouchability League, with its headquarters at Delhi and branches in different provincial centres, be established for the purpose of carrying on propaganda against untouchability and that for this purpose the following steps should be immediately taken:
('59', 472, 4, 6, 848713) (a) All public wells, dharmsalas, roads, schools, crematoriums, burn ing ghats, etc., be declared open to depressed classes.
('59', 472, 5, 7, 848838) (b) All public temples be opened to members of depressed classes.
('59', 472, 5, 8, 848904) Provided that no compulsion or force shall be used with regard to (a) and (b), but peaceful persuasion will be adopted as the only means.
('59', 472, 6, 9, 849042) This public meeting of Hindus appeals to the Hindu community to collect as large an amount as possible to be used for the removal of untoucha bility and cognate objects and for this purpose authorizes the President and [the] Secretary to take all necessary steps.
('59', 472, 6, 10, 849306) In pursuance of the said resolutions a society, named the All India Anti untouchability League subsequently named as Harijan Sevak Sangh was duly formed and a constitution was adopted by it at [Delhi] on 26th [October, 1932].
('59', 472, 6, 11, 849532) It was then considered advisable to frame a fuller constitution and the following was finally adopted at a meeting of the central board of All India Harijan Sevak Sangh held at Delhi on .

('59', 477, 5, 7, 858288) MY DEAR ABHYANKAR,
('59', 477, 6, 8, 858307) Here is copy of my further correspondence with Sjt.
('59', 477, 6, 9, 858359) Chhap khane.
('59', 477, 6, 10, 858372) 1 I suggest your seeking him and fixing up whatever is possible.
('59', 477, 6, 11, 858437) He is so definite about what happened during my visit to Sangli that it is difficult to contradict him without unimpeachable evidence or to believe that he is guilty of saying what is not true.
('59', 477, 6, 12, 858631) Joshi will perhaps show my letter 2 to you.

('59', 477, 10, 17, 858762) MY DEAR GHANSHYAMDAS, The English Harijan has become self supporting already.
('59', 477, 10, 18, 858840) The subscriptions received to date from street sales and annual subscribers leave a balance without the aid of the Rs. 1044 from the Central Board 3. This money can, therefore, now be refunded.
('59', 477, 10, 19, 859034) Will you kindly tell me how you would want this money to be sent to you?
('59', 477, 10, 20, 859107) I understand that you have to pay something to the Maharashtra Board.
('59', 477, 10, 21, 859177) My enquiry as to the method of refunding the money is merely with a view to saving commission on money order, draft or cheque.
('59', 477, 10, 22, 859304) Arrangements have been made to issue a Gujarati Harijan also.

('59', 478, 5, 10, 859984) SECRETARIES BRITISH INDIAN ASSOCIATION 18 BRITISH INDIAN STREET, CALCUTTA
('59', 478, 6, 11, 860058) DEAR FRIENDS, I thank you for your letter of 23rd ultimo enclosing a memorandum on the Poona Pact on behalf of the British Indian Asso ciation.
('59', 478, 6, 12, 860202) 2 I have been carrying on private correspondence with friends in this matter to ascertain Bengal opinion.
('59', 478, 6, 13, 860308) My own position is quite clear.
('59', 478, 6, 14, 860340) I was wholly uninterested in the number of seats reserved for untouchables or depressed classes.
('59', 478, 6, 15, 860437) Once the principle of reservation was conceded, my own position was that the more they got the better it was for them and for Hinduism and, therefore, for the whole of India from every point of view.
('59', 478, 6, 16, 860637) If untouchables are a part of ourselves, what can be grander than that we reserve seats for them without any
('59', 478, 7, 17, 860746) 1 The postscript appears only In the Shadow of the Mahatma, according to which source it was written in Hindi.
('59', 478, 7, 18, 860857) 2 The memorandum was prepared by a subcommittee, with Sir Bepin Bihary Ghose as its president” appointed by the All Parties Bengali Hindu Conference held on the January 11, 1933, in the hall of the British Indian Association.
('59', 478, 7, 19, 861083) The memorandum inter alia said: “It will thus be seen that the caste Hindus of Bengal are already smarting under a sense of injustice; and the Prime Minister’s acceptance of the Poona Pact comes as a sensible addition to their grievances.
('59', 478, 7, 20, 861322) Upon the basis of the facts set forth above, it is submitted that the Poona Pact did not fulfil the conditions for a substituted agreement laid down in the Prime Minister’s Award, and that, therefore, the Prime Minister has ample justification for re considering his assent to the same” (S.N. 20341 ) .
('59', 479, 0, 1, 861625) 480 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 479, 1, 2, 861667) reservation.
('59', 479, 1, 3, 861680) That to my mind would be the very best method of killing the spirit of difference.
('59', 479, 1, 4, 861763) I wholly dissent from the view that the principle of separation is left intact in the Yeravda Pact 1. On the contrary, the principle of joint election has been the main feature of the Yeravda Pact so far as the political side is concerned.
('59', 479, 1, 5, 862003) That the candidates for joint election have to be selected by Harijan electors in the first instance is surely no drawback, if we have faith in ourselves and in our regard for them, and if all the four candidates selected happen to be anti Hindu reactionaries it would be to me proof positive that during the period of grace we had failed to command their affection or esteem and we would have to thank our stars if we have to elect from among reactionary candidates.
('59', 479, 1, 6, 862471) I do not in any way share your fear that depressed class members will not do justice to the Hindu or the national cause.
('59', 479, 1, 7, 862592) Nor have I any fear that they will not be able to discharge their proper function as representatives of the people.
('59', 479, 1, 8, 862708) Should it prove otherwise it will mean that we are not fit for swaraj.
('59', 479, 1, 9, 862779) All things considered, therefore, I fear that I can be no party to the revision of the Pact, and in any case I am only one of the parties concerned, and my opinion will be valueless if all the other parties consent to or desire revision of the Pact in the direction suggested by the British Indian Association.
('59', 479, 1, 10, 863090) As I do not wish to compromise your position in any way, I have not entered into a public discussion of your position nor will I do so now unless you wish me to.
('59', 479, 1, 11, 863252) The very first person I wrote to was, I think, Dr. Bidhan Roy, and he told me that he was seeing all the interested parties and that he would write to me.
('59', 479, 1, 12, 863407) I have not heard from him since.
('59', 479, 1, 13, 863440) I am now in your hands.
('59', 479, 1, 14, 863464) Yours sincerely,

('59', 480, 2, 3, 863719) March 9, 1933
('59', 480, 3, 4, 863733) DEAR SATISBABOO, I have your letter giving me the contents of the two issues of the Bengali Harijan.
('59', 480, 3, 5, 863834) You will see the note 1 that is to appear in the ensuing number of the Harijan.
('59', 480, 3, 6, 863914) I note what you say about smallpox.
('59', 480, 3, 7, 863950) I do not know however whether it is a useful thing for us to have statistics about the distribution of smallpox among different castes.
('59', 480, 3, 8, 864086) I am glad you are keeping in touch with sanatanists.
('59', 480, 3, 9, 864139) That they will not listen to the other things until we give up temple entry is well known.
('59', 480, 3, 10, 864230) My suggestion is before them that they should start their own organizations and take up the other items.
('59', 480, 3, 11, 864335) If they don’t, it shows the hypocrisy of the whole thing.
('59', 480, 3, 12, 864393) As to varnashrama, I do mean that today if we must classify the whole of Hindus according to varna, there is only one varna possible, and that is Shudra.
('59', 480, 3, 13, 864547) Acceptance of the fourth varna by all will repre sent not only the true state of Hindu society, but it will at one stroke level down all distinctions of high and low.
('59', 480, 3, 14, 864714) That does not prevent anybody from attaining divine or any other knowledge, but it does mean that all live by their labour and all become entitled therefore to nothing more than simple maintenance.
('59', 480, 3, 15, 864912) That in my opinion is varna dharma in a nutshell.
('59', 480, 3, 16, 864962) That Hinduism has never lived up to it perfectly is true, but in my opinion it is equally true that Hinduism has in its purest period consciously lived up to it with success.
('59', 480, 3, 17, 865137) Yours sincerely,

('59', 481, 3, 4, 865305) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('59', 481, 3, 5, 865338) I have heard from Sjt.

('59', 481, 3, 9, 865486) Chhapkhane to have the matter cleared up.
('59', 481, 3, 10, 865528) I suggest your doing it.
('59', 481, 3, 11, 865553) Copies of the balance of corres pondence are being forwarded to Sjt.
('59', 481, 3, 12, 865622) Abhyankar.
('59', 481, 3, 13, 865633) Of course there is no question of a court case.
('59', 481, 3, 14, 865681) I can only plead with those who hold the money, but it is difficult for me to believe that a man like Sjt.
('59', 481, 3, 15, 865788) Chhap khane could be guilty of giving a false version of what happened during my visit to Sangli.
('59', 481, 3, 16, 865886) No theory can be built upon Sjt.
('59', 481, 3, 17, 865919) Gangadhar Rao’s recollection.
('59', 481, 3, 18, 865949) He does not say anything with confidence and it is not possible for anyone to recollect events that happened so many years ago.
('59', 481, 3, 19, 866077) Therefore, unless there is unimpeachable evidence to the contrary, Sjt.
('59', 481, 3, 20, 866149) Chhapkhane’s word must be taken, and in that event I can only plead with him to use some part of the money at least in connection with Harijan work.
('59', 481, 3, 21, 866298) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('59', 481, 8, 27, 866427) I had hoped to hear from you today.
('59', 481, 8, 28, 866463) I had your note scribbled on the back of the telegram that was received by you.
('59', 481, 8, 29, 866543) You were right in refusing the Rs. 25. I did not like the subscription to your note.
('59', 481, 8, 30, 866628) “Your son” looks unnatural and theatrical.

('59', 482, 1, 4, 867169) I had letters from S. 1 and Sir M. 2 I am therefore writing to Sir M. a letter giving him the purport of your confession and your promise, naturally withholding the names you have given me and I am sending a similar letter to S. That is right, is it not?
('59', 482, 1, 5, 867424) S. adds in his letter that he would be delighted if you came under my guidance and utilized your services.

('59', 482, 4, 10, 867671) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter about N. She was with me for a few days and I regret to have to report to you that her record is not what you describe.
('59', 482, 4, 11, 867832) Bit by bit she made her confession and it made a ghastly story.
('59', 482, 4, 12, 867896) She seems to have led a most extravagant and immoral life, even from tender years.
('59', 482, 4, 13, 867979) She was open to the advances of practically any person, and she was no better after her acceptance of Hindu religion.
('59', 482, 4, 14, 868097) She has debts amounting to nearly Rs. 10,000 spread over Europe and India.
('59', 482, 4, 15, 868172) She has travelled under a false name.
('59', 482, 4, 16, 868210) The only thing I am able to say in her favour is that she has been quite frank with me in her recital of her recklessnesses, though, as I have said, they came bit by bit in answer to my cross examination.
('59', 482, 4, 17, 868415) She has professed penitence and made me a definite promise to say good bye to her past life.
('59', 482, 4, 18, 868508) I have told her that I could not take her on trust but that if she proved true to her promise I would not hesitate to defend her and to guide her.
('59', 482, 4, 19, 868655) I do not know what capacity she has still left for controlling herself and keeping her promises.
('59', 482, 4, 20, 868752) In giving you this painful story of her confession I am betra ying no confidence, for, she was to have published a confession much like this immediately on her reaching Bangalore.

('59', 483, 1, 3, 869425) There are some further details, some other particulars of her life, which I may not disclose, nor, so far as I am aware, will she.
('59', 483, 1, 4, 869556) Her confession has made me sad.
('59', 483, 1, 5, 869588) I have had many boys and girls making their confessions to me, but it has never been my mis fortune to come across a case like N.’s.
('59', 483, 1, 6, 869721) But I have no right to judge her.
('59', 483, 1, 7, 869755) Judgment is in the hands of God.
('59', 483, 1, 8, 869788) Being myself in need of pity from the world I only pity her and love to help her to the extent of my ability.
('59', 483, 1, 9, 869898) I felt drawn to her when she wrote to me announcing her decision to fast with me if I had commenced the fast in the begin ning of the year.
('59', 483, 1, 10, 870038) I had warned her against it and the correspondence be came lengthened.
('59', 483, 1, 11, 870109) I had hoped that she would become an excellent member of the army of Harijan servants and her letters give all that promise.

('59', 484, 7, 12, 871081) DEAR PANDITJI, I was amazed to receive your undated letter.
('59', 484, 7, 13, 871141) So far as your son’s visit is concerned, he was to come to me not as one of the Shastri disputants but as one desirous of answering my questions, enlightening me and to this end seeing me from day to day for 10 days or longer if necessary, and he was to come to me as your representative even as you had come 1 without imposing any condi tions on me.
('59', 484, 7, 14, 871492) It surprises me that now you should describe his coming to me as one of the disputants in the nature of fulfilment of your promise.
('59', 484, 7, 15, 871624) Secondly, from the very commencement of the discussions, untouchability as it is practised today was the subject matter of discussion 2, and I have a letter written by Pandits on the very date that they came to the effect that that was the common ground between them and me.
('59', 484, 7, 16, 871899) You, your son or anybody can see the original docu ment in my possession.
('59', 484, 7, 17, 871973) But the Pandits had imposed another condi tion which they thought I would never accept, but in order not to miss the discussion with them when they had come as far as the jail gate, I

('59', 485, 1, 5, 872581) Of all the painful episodes that I have had the misfortune to face in my contact with Shastris, this was the most painful.
('59', 485, 1, 6, 872704) Of the other parts of your letter I desire to say nothing beyond this that I am unable to endorse your interpretation of the Shastras as being repugnant to common sense, universal morals and contrary to the interpretation of the Shastras by Pandits having no less learning and authority than the opposite school and in the presence of such a conflict of interpretation you will not blame me if I accept that which is more consistent with my moral sense.
('59', 485, 1, 7, 873158) As to your proposed fast, whilst I should deplore it if you ever came to undertake it, such fasts are an everyday occurrence in Hinduism and have always to be welcomed when they come from the purity of one’s heart and without anger or malice.
('59', 485, 1, 8, 873401) You would not write as you have done about the two Bills now pending before the Legislature if you had carefully studied the contents and application of these Bills.
('59', 485, 1, 9, 873567) 1 In my opinion they constitute no interference with anyone’s religion or conscience.
('59', 485, 1, 10, 873653) One Bill takes untouchability out of the domain of civil law which is what you and I and everybody else should desire, and the other ensures the free exercise of conscience by all, whereas today the conscience of a growing number of people is constrained.
('59', 485, 1, 11, 873909) Yours sincerely, PANDIT PANCHANAN TARKARATNA CALCUTTA

('59', 485, 3, 13, 873994) 1 These were unofficial Bills relating to the abolition of untouchability: one to be sponsored in the Central Legislative Assembly by Ranga Iyer and the other in the Madras Legislative Council by Dr. Subbaroyan.
('59', 485, 3, 14, 874206) Ranga Iyer’s Bill was to come up for introduction first on February 27 and then again on March 24. On both occasions “protracted discussions on other non official Bills by members who were hostile or indifferent to the anti untouchability movement” vitiated the attempt.

('59', 487, 1, 2, 875731) 663. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
('59', 487, 2, 3, 875762) March 9, 1933
('59', 487, 3, 4, 875776) NARANDAS,
('59', 487, 4, 5, 875786) I send with this my reply 1 to the question asked by Mary and Duncan.
('59', 487, 4, 6, 875856) Read and think over it and then pass it on to them.
('59', 487, 4, 7, 875908) I wrote to you 2 yesterday regarding Lakshmi and also sent a message for the occasion.
('59', 487, 4, 8, 875995) Most probably Devdas will arrive there on Sunday.
('59', 487, 5, 9, 876045) I am becoming convinced that the source of asthma also is in the stomach.
('59', 487, 5, 10, 876119) If, therefore, Chimanlal and Jamna cling to the experiment of milk diet with determination, their asthma is bound to be cured.
('59', 487, 5, 11, 876246) And they need not also think that they must drink a certain quantity of milk.
('59', 487, 5, 12, 876324) I think that they will be able to digest only a very small quantity.
('59', 487, 5, 13, 876393) Milk is drunk for the sake of the proteins, the ghee and the vitamins which it contains.
('59', 487, 5, 14, 876482) If proteins give strength, they also diminish it if there is the slightest excess of them.
('59', 487, 5, 15, 876573) Weak people, therefore, can build up strength by drinking milk in a very small quantity.
('59', 487, 5, 16, 876662) The chief food of such people should be vegetables and juicy fruits.
('59', 487, 5, 17, 876731) Without trying other remedies, therefore, if they eat bhaji and juicy fruits in plenty and drink a very small quantity of milk for strength, they are bound to get all right.
('59', 487, 5, 18, 876905) And if this regimen does not help them, I will not mind their concluding that nothing else will and doing nothing.
('59', 487, 5, 19, 877020) They should drink the milk unboiled and mixed with some fruit or green vegetable.
('59', 487, 5, 20, 877102) In doing so, they would be eating milk instead of drinking it, and it will then be much easier to digest.
('59', 487, 5, 21, 877208) They should also regularly do pranayamas, slowly and moderately, on an empty stomach.
('59', 487, 5, 22, 877294) Besides, they should take sun bath.
('59', 487, 5, 23, 877330) In this season, hip bath also is bound to be beneficial.
('59', 487, 6, 24, 877387) I have looked into Radha’s accounts.
('59', 487, 6, 25, 877424) I am returning them.
('59', 487, 6, 26, 877445) I think in the present circumstances we are helpless in this matter.

('59', 488, 0, 1, 877622) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 489
('59', 488, 1, 2, 877667) Expenses on food alone come to Rs. 30. Rs. 55 account for rent, railway fare and other expenses during the journey, and Rs. 25 for the doctor’s fees, maid servant, postage, repair of watch, etc., and playing cards for bezique.
('59', 488, 1, 3, 877894) There may be room for criticism in regard to this item of Rs. 25, but there can be no criticism in regard to the Rs. 30 for food, if the amount is for one month.
('59', 488, 1, 4, 878056) The whole question of Ashram expenses, that is, of our way of living, is a complicated one.
('59', 488, 1, 5, 878148) If we carefully watch ourselves daily and introduce greater and greater simplicity in the Ashram, we shall learn to rely more and more on God in our misfortunes in the shape of illness and accidents.
('59', 488, 1, 6, 878348) Our work then will shine better.
('59', 488, 1, 7, 878381) We shall feel happy with ourselves and will be safe in all circumstances.
('59', 488, 1, 8, 878455) It will then be easy for us to control, without criticizing them, those others who spend too much.
('59', 488, 1, 9, 878554) “We” here means most of the inmates of the Ashram who are seekers after truth and have dedicated themselves to its pursuit.
('59', 488, 1, 10, 878678) Personally I feel that a time is coming when we shall have to live like sannyasis confined to the Ashram.
('59', 488, 1, 11, 878784) That is, we shall have to be content with whatever treatment we can get in the Ashram itself for any illness.
('59', 488, 1, 12, 878894) Almora was intended, is still intended, to supplement the Ashram.
('59', 488, 1, 13, 878960) But I think it would be desirable to renounce even that.
('59', 488, 1, 14, 879017) But we can do all these things only by cultivating such a climate of opinion in the Ashram.
('59', 488, 1, 15, 879109) In doing so, nobody should look to what the other inmates do.
('59', 488, 1, 16, 879171) Anybody who feels that he ought to practise such sannyasa should start doing so.
('59', 488, 1, 17, 879252) In other words, he will not go anywhere outside the Ashram for treatment of illness or for his personal work.
('59', 488, 1, 18, 879362) Just now, this is only an aspiration.
('59', 488, 1, 19, 879400) I have merely taken this opportunity to put the suggestion before you so that you may think over it at leisure and discuss it with other senior inmates.
('59', 488, 2, 20, 879553) Sitla Sahai has attacked me too.
('59', 488, 2, 21, 879586) But I have thrown the responsi bility for the whole thing on you.
('59', 488, 2, 22, 879652) He also has complained that I have shifted the responsibility.
('59', 488, 2, 23, 879715) I will put up with that charge.
('59', 488, 2, 24, 879747) Ask Purushot tam to write a detailed letter to me.
('59', 488, 2, 25, 879798) The doctor’s remarks in regard to Kanu seem justified to me.
('59', 488, 2, 26, 879859) If he has carefully learnt how to do the massage, if he gives complete rest to the affected part and if it is gently massaged every day, it will certainly be cured.
('59', 488, 2, 27, 880024) The improve ment will of course take time.

('59', 489, 1, 2, 880109) Parashuram seems to have joined the Ashram to test your capacity for endurance.
('59', 489, 1, 3, 880189) But you are strong enough and so we need not worry.
('59', 489, 1, 4, 880241) You may give him divorce when you can bear it no longer.
('59', 489, 1, 5, 880298) Personally, I am now ready to accept this reform in Hindu marriage.
('59', 489, 1, 6, 880366) Millions of poor Hindus do have the custom of divorce.
('59', 489, 1, 7, 880421) Their lives would become unbearable without it.
('59', 489, 1, 8, 880469) I see no dharma in people regarding themselves as belonging to the twice born class and forcing women to accept their ideal.
('59', 489, 1, 9, 880594) Spiritual bonds must be indissoluble.
('59', 489, 1, 10, 880632) But when the ideal is forced upon people through law, it ceases to be dharma.
('59', 489, 1, 11, 880710) I was discussing the question of marriage with the Ashram, but I digressed and discussed the problem of ordinary marriage.
('59', 489, 1, 12, 880833) Those who join the Ashram marry it, and say so.
('59', 489, 1, 13, 880881) The Ashram is the wife and the person who joins it is the husband.
('59', 489, 1, 14, 880948) When, however, the bond becomes unbearable to the poor wife, she has every right to ask for divorce.
('59', 489, 1, 15, 881049) You may use this right whenever you wish to.

('59', 490, 2, 3, 881253) APPENDIX 1
('59', 490, 3, 4, 881264) TALK WITH SADASHIVRAO AND SHINDE1
('59', 490, 4, 5, 881298) January 13, 1933
('59', 490, 5, 6, 881315) BAPU: Even after this Bill is passed the majority should not exercise their
('59', 490, 6, 7, 881391) right to frighten away the minority.
('59', 490, 6, 8, 881428) The temple should be kept open for a few hours
('59', 490, 7, 9, 881475) daily for the sake of the minority.
('59', 490, 7, 10, 881511) They too have a certain sentiment for the image
('59', 490, 8, 11, 881559) and believe in its importance and power.
('59', 490, 8, 12, 881600) I would say to them that they should have darshan to their heart’s content before the temple becomes ‘impure’; I would go in
('59', 490, 9, 13, 881725) after that.
('59', 490, 10, 14, 881737) SADASHIVRAO: But would it not hurt their inferiority complex?
('59', 490, 11, 15, 881799) BAPU: The question of inferiority arises only in the case of Harijans.
('59', 490, 11, 16, 881870) If the reformists are in a majority, the Harijans should act like seniors, and should do out of their free will what they are not bound to do by law.
('59', 490, 12, 17, 882020) I don’t want separate temples erected.
('59', 490, 12, 18, 882059) But I would say to them [the sanatanists]: ‘I shall make the necessary arrangement for you.
('59', 490, 12, 19, 882151) You should not go away.
('59', 490, 12, 20, 882175) I do not want to pay you in the same coin.
('59', 490, 12, 21, 882218) You had regarded us as low.
('59', 490, 12, 22, 882246) You asked up to be content with having darshan of the tower.
('59', 490, 12, 23, 882307) But we are not going to
('59', 490, 13, 24, 882331) regard you as low.
('59', 490, 13, 25, 882350) We shall let you precede us and we shall respect your sentiments regarding the purity of the image.’ Man compromises either through weakness or because he is strong.
('59', 490, 13, 26, 882516) As a votary of truth I would make a compromise on the basis of my strength.
('59', 490, 13, 27, 882592) Only yesterday I dealt with the sanatanists in this way.
('59', 490, 13, 28, 882649) They asked me to sign some document.
('59', 490, 13, 29, 882686) Normally I would not endorse such a statement.
('59', 490, 13, 30, 882733) But in order to satisfy them I affixed my signature, but after making a couple of most essential changes.
('59', 490, 13, 31, 882839) If I disclose what took place between them and me, it is not going to shed lustre on Hinduism.
('59', 490, 14, 32, 882934) I have learnt a lot from my involvement in this issue.
('59', 490, 14, 33, 882989) I came to know what the Shastras had to say.
('59', 490, 14, 34, 883034) Without knowing all this I could not have issued such statements.
('59', 490, 14, 35, 883100) I would not have at any rate been able to write with such authority.
('59', 490, 14, 36, 883169) Even the thought of this compromise would not have occurred to me had I not had all these interviews with them.
('59', 490, 15, 37, 883281) SHINDE: But they think this is where the hitch comes in.
('59', 490, 16, 38, 883338) BAPU: I do not look upon it as any hitch.
('59', 490, 16, 39, 883380) I do not believe that all those who
('59', 490, 17, 40, 883416) 1 Vide “Letter to S. Nagasundaram”, 13 1 1933
('59', 491, 0, 1, 883462) 492 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 491, 1, 2, 883504) raise objections are insincere.
('59', 491, 1, 3, 883536) I don’t want to drive them out of the temples.
('59', 491, 1, 4, 883583) The lives of those who go to temples with a sincere heart are linked with the temples.
('59', 491, 1, 5, 883670) I say this on the strength of my mother’s example.
('59', 491, 1, 6, 883721) She would not put a grain in her mouth without having darshan in a temple, however ill and bed ridden she might be.
('59', 491, 2, 7, 883837) She used to derive strength from this practice of hers.
('59', 491, 2, 8, 883893) I do not want to exercise the right I have acquired as though I were a demon or a bully.
('59', 491, 2, 9, 883982) I have to give a thought to a true mother.
('59', 491, 2, 10, 884025) All the women who visit temples are but mothers to me.
('59', 491, 2, 11, 884080) If they want to preserve the purity [of the images], they may do so.
('59', 491, 2, 12, 884149) The Harijans should be charitable enough to let them do it.
('59', 491, 2, 13, 884209) In fact they should let them do it of their own free will.
('59', 491, 2, 14, 884268) Take the instance of spectacles and injections which are in vogue.
('59', 491, 2, 15, 884335) Our ancestors would regard these as superstitions.
('59', 491, 2, 16, 884386) Tomorrow there may come up somebody who may regard praying as so much superstition.
('59', 491, 2, 17, 884470) Even then we ought to respect people’s sentiments.
('59', 491, 2, 18, 884521) Therefore the compromise I have suggested is absolutely correct.
('59', 491, 2, 19, 884586) The sanatanists would not admit it but I do see they are coming closer to me.
('59', 491, 2, 20, 884664) I am myself a Harijan and I have influence over them.
('59', 491, 3, 21, 884718) SHINDE: The Harijans will of course listen to you.
('59', 491, 3, 22, 884769) They are bound to listen to you.
('59', 491, 3, 23, 884802) When I ask you not to make any compromise, I do not mean that there will never be any compromise.
('59', 491, 4, 24, 884900) BAPU: Mate wanted a segregated space for having darshan.
('59', 491, 4, 25, 884957) That was an unfair
('59', 491, 5, 26, 884976) compromise.
('59', 491, 6, 27, 884988) SHINDE: From the spiritual point of view your compromise is no compromise at all.
('59', 491, 6, 28, 885070) It will gradually wear out.
('59', 491, 7, 29, 885098) BAPU: Yes, it takes for granted mutual respect and sincerity.
('59', 491, 7, 30, 885160) Only then does a temple become a true temple.
('59', 491, 7, 31, 885206) In the same way the sanatanists can, if they want to, have tables reserved in restaurants.
('59', 491, 7, 32, 885297) While I suggest all this I take it for granted that we are in the majority.
('59', 491, 7, 33, 885373) If the sanatanists are in the majority we may not set foot in the temples.
('59', 491, 8, 34, 885448) I have found out a new way of looking at compromises.
('59', 491, 8, 35, 885502) The initiative for compromise should come from the stronger party.
('59', 491, 8, 36, 885569) Only he who has truth on his side can arrive at such a compromise.
('59', 491, 9, 37, 885636) SHINDE: Yes, the same is true of forgiveness, which only the strong can practise.
('59', 491, 10, 38, 885718) BAPU: This compromise in no way detracts from your principles, or mine or anybody else’s.
('59', 491, 10, 39, 885808) One that would do violence to other’s principles can only be called cruel.

('59', 492, 5, 7, 886116) It is a voice other than our own.
('59', 492, 5, 8, 886150) It could be the voice of Satan or of God.
('59', 492, 5, 9, 886192) In order to ensure that it is God that speaks from within us, we should correctly observe the yamas and niyamas.
('59', 492, 5, 10, 886305) Millions of men may claim to hear the Inner Voice but the true Inner Voice could be heard in very few.
('59', 492, 5, 11, 886408) We cannot adduce proof in its support.
('59', 492, 5, 12, 886447) But it does have its influence.
('59', 492, 5, 13, 886479) The Inner Voice is a power beyond us but it is not an outer force.
('59', 492, 5, 14, 886546) ‘Beyond us’ means ‘a power which is beyond our ego’.
('59', 492, 5, 15, 886599) When the ego is lying dormant there are two forces which act upon it, the real and the unreal.
('59', 492, 5, 16, 886694) When we are one with the power that is real it is said, in the language of mysticism, that God is speaking through us.
('59', 492, 5, 17, 886813) When we are one with sat our ego is reduced to zero.
('59', 492, 6, 18, 886866) Q. When can man claim to have heard the Inner Voice?
('59', 492, 7, 19, 886919) BAPU: That depends upon the man.
('59', 492, 7, 20, 886952) When he experiences that he is not acting on his own he can make that claim.
('59', 492, 7, 21, 887029) Supposing I constantly try to hear the Inner Voice, I constantly pray to God that He should act through me and reduce me to a cipher, a moment will come when I shall feel that the Lord is letting me hear Him.
('59', 492, 7, 22, 887238) At such a time I can even say that I am hearing the voice of the Lord.
('59', 492, 7, 23, 887309) But how can I prove it?
('59', 492, 7, 24, 887333) It is for my conduct to prove it.
('59', 492, 7, 25, 887367) But that too will not be the final test.
('59', 492, 7, 26, 887408) Supposing a man lies buried in a cave in the Himalayas and God sends me there to see him.
('59', 492, 7, 27, 887498) Supposing I reach the place, I dig a little and meet the man.
('59', 492, 7, 28, 887560) Even then quite likely it may not be that I heard the Inner Voice.
('59', 492, 7, 29, 887627) It could be a mere accident or even my illusion or someone might have said it to me.
('59', 492, 7, 30, 887712) The world will no doubt judge me from the result.
('59', 492, 7, 31, 887762) If the result is favourable the world will say that it was a miracle.
('59', 492, 7, 32, 887832) But indeed there can be no final proof in this case.
('59', 492, 7, 33, 887885) Man himself does not know when he is deceiving himself, or when he is pretending.
('59', 492, 7, 34, 887967) There is a greater danger in hypocrisy than in self deception.
('59', 492, 7, 35, 888030) We find further proof when there are many instances pointing towards the same conclusion.
('59', 492, 7, 36, 888120) This includes all the great men, Buddha, Krishna, Mohammed.
('59', 492, 7, 37, 888180) It was not with their own power that they uttered the truths.
('59', 492, 7, 38, 888242) But some occult power urged them to such utterance.
('59', 492, 7, 39, 888294) Some people are worthy enough, and through them the occult power works.
('59', 492, 7, 40, 888366) But we cannot be sure when it will happen.

('59', 493, 2, 3, 888562) DISCUSSION WITH DHARMADEV1
('59', 493, 3, 4, 888589) January 17, 1933
('59', 493, 4, 5, 888606) BAPU: I accept heredity to the extent that the progeny of a pure Brahmin man and a pure Brahmin woman should be a Brahmin.
('59', 493, 4, 6, 888729) If such a Brahmin raises his children as Shudras he should be regarded as fallen from his varna.
('59', 493, 4, 7, 888826) He becomes a fallen Brahmin.
('59', 493, 5, 8, 888855) DHARMADEV: But why at all call him a Brahmin?
('59', 493, 6, 9, 888901) BAPU: There is no high and low among the varnas.
('59', 493, 6, 10, 888950) We may call him only fallen because he can return to his varna by quitting his fallen state.
('59', 493, 6, 11, 889043) Leave aside the talk of high and low.
('59', 493, 6, 12, 889081) Suppose a carpenter gives up carpentry and takes up the work of cleaning lavatories.
('59', 493, 6, 13, 889166) The Gita would describe him as fallen from dharma.
('59', 493, 6, 14, 889217) “Better is
('59', 493, 7, 15, 889228) death in the discharge of one’s duty.” A carpenter may not go after the work of a goldsmith.
('59', 493, 7, 16, 889321) Similarly, if he tries to get instructed in the Vedas, even then I would call him a carpenter who had fallen.
('59', 493, 7, 17, 889431) We want to bring about harmony between dharma and karma (i.e., practical life).
('59', 493, 7, 18, 889511) Will it do if we talked of making people adventurous and asked them all to embark upon trade?
('59', 493, 7, 19, 889605) Hence occupations came to be hereditary.
('59', 493, 7, 20, 889646) We may only ask them to apply their talents and powers for society’s enduring welfare.
('59', 493, 7, 21, 889733) Today we admire those who assault the Kanchanjungha.
('59', 493, 7, 22, 889786) My heart does not admire them; it censures them.
('59', 493, 7, 23, 889835) It is not that we never made any discoveries.
('59', 493, 7, 24, 889881) Patanjali is responsible for the scientific discovery of ahimsa.
('59', 493, 8, 25, 889946) DHARMADEV: Does it mean that one may not develop in oneself any quality appropriate to [any other] varna?
('59', 493, 8, 26, 890052) I am a Kshatriya but I have no Kshatriya quality.
('59', 493, 8, 27, 890102) You are a Vaishya, but where is your Vaishya conduct?
('59', 493, 9, 28, 890156) BAPU: I was talking of a pure social order.
('59', 493, 9, 29, 890200) No such order exists today.
('59', 493, 9, 30, 890228) There is today a confusion of varnas because the ashrama system has disappeared.
('59', 493, 9, 31, 890309) Only one ashrama remains now—the householder’s.
('59', 493, 9, 32, 890357) And that too not based on dharma but on self indulgence.
('59', 493, 9, 33, 890414) And the varna that remains is the Shudra’s.
('59', 493, 9, 34, 890458) Today we are slaves under an alien rule because there are no more Kshatriyas, no more Brahmins, no more Vaishyas.
('59', 493, 9, 35, 890572) The Vaishyas are busy making money.
('59', 493, 9, 36, 890608) And can we describe ourselves even as Shudras?
('59', 493, 9, 37, 890655) We serve only under compulsion, not regarding service as our dharma.
('59', 493, 9, 38, 890724) A Shastri admitted to me that we are all Chandalas by our actions.
('59', 493, 9, 39, 890791) What should this Chandala community do?
('59', 493, 9, 40, 890831) Should it attempt to bring about varnadharma?
('59', 493, 9, 41, 890877) I don’t say
('59', 493, 10, 42, 890889) that this varnadharma should have the same name.
('59', 493, 10, 43, 890938) The Shastras have described
('59', 493, 11, 44, 890966) 1 Vide “Letter to A College Student”, 17 1 1933.
('59', 494, 0, 1, 891015) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 495
('59', 494, 1, 2, 891060) dharma as without beginning but they do speak of organization into varnas.
('59', 494, 1, 3, 891135) I am yet doing my sadhana.
('59', 494, 1, 4, 891162) I cannot speak in this matter with any self confidence because my sadhana is not adequate.
('59', 494, 2, 5, 891253) DHARMADEV: Then why don’t you say that you don’t believe in any varna, as there is no varna today?
('59', 494, 2, 6, 891352) You have maintained that a Brahmin is born, but Brahminhood is not acquired by birth.
('59', 494, 2, 7, 891438) “A man is born a Shudra.” 1
('59', 494, 3, 8, 891466) BAPU: I don’t agree with you on this point.
('59', 494, 3, 9, 891510) The Arya Samajists have restricted their reason.
('59', 494, 3, 10, 891559) My language is aphoristic, it lacks precision.
('59', 494, 3, 11, 891606) It is therefore open to several interpretations.
('59', 494, 4, 12, 891655) DHARMADEV: You say that Brahmins should regain the high position they held of yore.
('59', 494, 5, 13, 891739) BAPU: Quite correct.
('59', 494, 5, 14, 891760) I was born a Vaishya, but people see in me certain qualities worthy of a Brahmin and say that I am a Brahmin.
('59', 494, 5, 15, 891870) But I must earn my livelihood through my qualities as a Shudra.
('59', 494, 5, 16, 891934) At the Ashram everyone works eight hours a day to earn his food.
('59', 494, 5, 17, 891999) This communism of mine is deduced from Hinduism.
('59', 494, 5, 18, 892048) Ruskin also taught the same thing.
('59', 494, 5, 19, 892083) But today the Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra all want to become multi millionaires.
('59', 494, 5, 20, 892172) Hence I maintained that everyone should have equal payment, whether a barrister or a Shudra.
('59', 494, 5, 21, 892265) Everyone should dedicate his talent to the service of the community.
('59', 494, 5, 22, 892334) If the whole community made sacrifices the people would not starve.
('59', 494, 5, 23, 892402) Even gamblers have everything in common.
('59', 494, 5, 24, 892443) We are worse than the gamblers.
('59', 494, 5, 25, 892475) I have come across such generous gamblers on board who pocket nothing as their personal gains but spend it off in the company.
('59', 494, 5, 26, 892602) My heart weeps at our present condition.
('59', 494, 5, 27, 892643) Tears may not fall from my eyes but my heart does weep.
('59', 494, 5, 28, 892699) I cry when anyone commits an untruth or succumbs to passion at the Ashram which runs on public funds.
('59', 494, 5, 29, 892801) I wish that the experiment which I am carrying on at the Ashram is tried in the whole world.
('59', 494, 5, 30, 892894) If I fail in this I would not mind taking a thousand births to fulfil it.
('59', 494, 5, 31, 892968) Whoever employs his talent for personal gain is good for nothing.
('59', 494, 5, 32, 893034) One’s talent ought to be utilized for one’s own community.
('59', 494, 5, 33, 893093) I must express my thoughts in a new language.
('59', 494, 6, 34, 893139) DHARMADEV: But you also say that you accept both varna and karma [one’s actions as deciding one’s caste].
('59', 494, 7, 35, 893245) BAPU: Look, here is a matter of justice.
('59', 494, 7, 36, 893286) What can we do if people do not lend
('59', 494, 8, 37, 893323) us their ear however much we may carry on our propaganda?
('59', 494, 8, 38, 893381) That is why man has been
('59', 494, 9, 39, 893406) advised to observe silence.
('59', 494, 9, 40, 893434) What else can be propagated except truth?
('59', 494, 9, 41, 893476) I have declared
('59', 494, 10, 42, 893492) what varnadharma is, but now I don’t propagate it because it is irrelevant.
('59', 494, 10, 43, 893568) There is no
('59', 494, 11, 44, 893580) feeling of high and low in varnadharma, but it is very much there in untouchability.
('59', 494, 12, 45, 893665) 1 The second half of the verse says, “He becomes a twice born (Brahmin) through his sacraments.”
('59', 495, 0, 1, 893762) 496 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 495, 1, 2, 893804) Therefore untouchability is an excrescence on varnadharma.
('59', 495, 2, 3, 893863) DHARMADEV: It was born of caste.
('59', 495, 3, 4, 893896) BAPU: Yes, from caste; but with the disappearance of untouchability the feeling of high and low among the castes will also go.
('59', 495, 3, 5, 894023) The greatest reptile is the serpent of untouchability.
('59', 495, 3, 6, 894078) I don’t care if the rest, such as the scorpion and so on persist.
('59', 495, 3, 7, 894144) When untouchability goes .
('59', 495, 4, 8, 894171) DHARMADEV: But it will not go unless we break the barriers of caste.
('59', 495, 5, 9, 894240) BAPU: Why did I undertake this fast?
('59', 495, 5, 10, 894277) only to do away with that feeling of high and low.
('59', 495, 6, 11, 894328) DHARMADEV Why don’t you say it plainly?
('59', 495, 6, 12, 894368) You mix up the issues of heredity and actions.
('59', 495, 7, 13, 894415) BAPU: But I do proclaim myself an enemy of caste; I am a champion of the varnas.
('59', 495, 8, 14, 894496) DHARMADEV: But you do mix up [the issues of] heredity and actions.
('59', 495, 8, 15, 894563) Why should we regard Harijans as Shudras?
('59', 495, 8, 16, 894605) But you have said as much.
('59', 495, 9, 17, 894632) BAPU: Now I would not repeat that statement.
('59', 495, 9, 18, 894677) Now I would only say that we may not regard him as Chandala.
('59', 495, 10, 19, 894738) DHARMADEV: Why don’t you clarify the sanatana dharma?
('59', 495, 10, 20, 894792) Sanatana dharma is the eternal dharma.
('59', 495, 11, 21, 894831) BAPU: Sanatana dharma might contain the eternal dharma, but if the people
('59', 495, 12, 22, 894905) would not accept this position how will it remain eternal?
('59', 495, 12, 23, 894964) I subscribe to the Jain theory of anekantavada.
('59', 495, 12, 24, 895012) I do not accept any one thing as admitting only one
('59', 495, 13, 25, 895064) solution.
('59', 495, 13, 26, 895074) Hence I call this dharma the true dharma.
('59', 495, 13, 27, 895116) But I would not call it sanatana—
('59', 495, 14, 28, 895150) as long as the world does not accept it.
('59', 495, 15, 29, 895191) DHARMADEV: Where did you find this interpretation?
('59', 495, 16, 30, 895242) BAPU: This is the historical interpretation.
('59', 495, 16, 31, 895287) The historical interpretation of goghna 1 is different from its actual meaning.
('59', 495, 17, 32, 895367) DHARMADEV: No.
('59', 495, 17, 33, 895382) You are not clarifying your position to the sanatanists.
('59', 495, 17, 34, 895439) You ought to tell them that sanatana dharma means the eternal dharma, the Vedic dharma; all that is opposed to it is adharma.
('59', 495, 17, 35, 895565) “There is no dharma higher than the Veda.” You
('59', 495, 18, 36, 895612) have said in one place that the Shastras should be acceptable both to the reason and to the heart.
('59', 495, 18, 37, 895711) Nothing in the Vedas is contrary to reason.
('59', 495, 19, 38, 895755) BAPU: Say, there are two Shastris quarrelling over the interpretation of the word duhitri.
('59', 495, 19, 39, 895846) One says that it means a daughter, the other says it means one who
('59', 495, 20, 40, 895913) milks the cows.
('59', 495, 20, 41, 895929) Both of them went far in the dispute and the judge ordered both of them to be sent to the gallows because one talks of one thing and the other talks of
('59', 495, 21, 42, 896081) 1 Slaughterer of cows
('59', 496, 0, 1, 896103) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 497
('59', 496, 1, 2, 896148) the same thing in a different sense.
('59', 496, 1, 3, 896185) Similarly we cannot carry on a discussion by each of us offering a different interpretation of sanatana dharma.
('59', 496, 1, 4, 896297) Therefore I say that you are making nonsense of sanatana dharma.
('59', 496, 1, 5, 896362) They say there is a sanatana dharma to marry off a ten year old girl.
('59', 496, 1, 6, 896432) Now if the people would not support such a thing, who would call it sanatana dharma?
('59', 496, 1, 7, 896517) They say they have millions of men behind them, I say there are millions of men behind me.
('59', 496, 1, 8, 896608) I emphatically say that I talk of nothing but the ancient dharma which I interpret as above.
('59', 496, 1, 9, 896701) Someone said that I should declare myself an Arya Samajist.
('59', 496, 1, 10, 896761) I said, “Why?
('59', 496, 1, 11, 896775) Is it because people might stop agreeing with me?” Should I give up the Smritis, Itihasas, Puranas?
('59', 496, 1, 12, 896875) I have a different interpretation of
('59', 496, 2, 13, 896912) image worship in which I believe.
('59', 496, 2, 14, 896946) I even maintain that there is image worship in Christianity and even Islam.
('59', 496, 2, 15, 897022) According to my dharma I should preserve all that is worth preserving and reject all else.
('59', 496, 2, 16, 897113) Hence I say that I don’t want a new name.
('59', 496, 2, 17, 897155) The name Hindu dharma is enough for me.
('59', 496, 2, 18, 897195) For me Hindu dharma is an unfathomable ocean.
('59', 496, 2, 19, 897241) It includes many things.
('59', 496, 2, 20, 897266) Therefore I call myself neither an Arya Samajist nor a Brahmo Samajist but only a Hindu.
('59', 496, 3, 21, 897355) DHARMADEV: In what sense do you believe in image worship?
('59', 496, 3, 22, 897413) Acharya Ramadev maintains that since the temple is a public place it should be open to all.
('59', 496, 3, 23, 897505) However, we should try and persuade the priests to give up image worship.
('59', 496, 4, 24, 897579) BAPU: Here I differ with you.
('59', 496, 4, 25, 897609) I believe that those who have the darshan of the
('59', 496, 5, 26, 897658) Lord in Kashi Vishwanath [really] see Him.
('59', 496, 5, 27, 897701) My mother never took a meal without having darshan of the Lord in the temple.
('59', 496, 5, 28, 897779) She used to tell me that she went there to
('59', 496, 6, 29, 897822) become pure, to fulfil her dharma.
('59', 496, 6, 30, 897857) I bow to her.
('59', 496, 6, 31, 897871) I wondered what dharma I could teach this mother.
('59', 496, 6, 32, 897921) All these things are imaginary and are sustained only by faith.
('59', 496, 7, 33, 897985) DHARMADEV: But would one agree to see bread in stone?
('59', 496, 8, 34, 898039) BAPU: Yes, if a man looked upon stone as bread and ate it he will no doubt
('59', 496, 9, 35, 898114) have peace at the moment.
('59', 496, 9, 36, 898140) Vishwamitra took the flesh after stealing it.
('59', 496, 9, 37, 898186) He bathed and performed sandhya, and then threw it away.
('59', 496, 9, 38, 898243) But did he not have peace when in the first
('59', 496, 10, 39, 898287) instance he took it?
('59', 496, 10, 40, 898308) I am a votary of truth, I am in quest of God, I find new gems daily
('59', 496, 11, 41, 898376) which I go on distributing to others.
('59', 496, 11, 42, 898414) The same thing is to be found in my recent
('59', 496, 12, 43, 898457) statement about civil disobedience and untouchability.
('59', 496, 12, 44, 898512) It may look incomprehensible
('59', 496, 13, 45, 898541) because the science of satyagraha is new, people are not used to it.
('59', 496, 14, 46, 898610) DHRMADEV: Some say that you are promulgating a new Veda with the help of your Inner Voice.
('59', 496, 15, 47, 898701) BAPU: Let them say so!
('59', 496, 15, 48, 898724) I believe there can be no new Veda.
('59', 496, 15, 49, 898760) The Vedas are endless.
('59', 496, 15, 50, 898783) Anybody’s utterance at the inspiration of the Lord within is nothing but Veda.
('59', 496, 15, 51, 898862) What Mohammed has said could also be Vedic utterance.
('59', 496, 15, 52, 898916) That is precisely why truth is Veda.
('59', 496, 16, 53, 898953) DHARMADEV: Veda is truth.

('59', 497, 1, 3, 899115) If you come across a statement opposed to morality or truth you should say that it is an interpolation.

('59', 497, 4, 8, 899397) DHARMADEV: At the time when you said it you wanted to bring about Hindu Muslim unity by any means.
('59', 497, 4, 9, 899496) That is why you said so.
('59', 497, 5, 10, 899521) BAPU: That means I told a lie?

('59', 497, 16, 26, 900180) decided on some dilatory course of action to gain time and refused immediate sanction

('59', 497, 18, 28, 900292) The Mahatma’s general health, I was told, is fairly good.

('59', 497, 18, 30, 900428) He was signing numerous replies to letters, which Mr. Mahadeo Desai had prepared earlier in consultation with him.

('59', 497, 19, 32, 900596) Gandhiji said that he would await the Government of India’s decision.
('59', 497, 19, 33, 900666) He stated that he had decided to express his views on the much discussed proposition to send round a committee to gauge opinion in respect of temple entry.

('59', 498, 1, 4, 901250) He would try to unsettle a settled question, in the same manner as he had done in the case of the Premier’s Award.

('59', 498, 4, 8, 901577) STATEMENT BY MADAN MOHAN MALAVIYA1
('59', 498, 5, 9, 901612) The object of the special session of the Sanatana Dharma Mahasabha is to focus and voice the most informed and most esteemable orthodox opinion on some questions, including those relating to the removal of untouchability and temple entry which has been agitating the sanatanist world on one side, and those who are described as reformers on the other.
('59', 498, 5, 10, 901964) I have been distressed to note differences between the two sides becoming acute, and it is evident that if these differences are unsolved, the Hindu community would be further divided and weakened.
('59', 498, 5, 11, 902162) The differences are largely due to misunderstanding, and this, in its turn, is due to a great extent on imperfect knowledge of what the Shastras have laid down for our guidance in important matters in question.
('59', 498, 5, 12, 902373) It should not be necessary to say that Mahatma Gandhi cannot desire to injure sanatana dharma.
('59', 498, 5, 13, 902468) He has proved to the world that he is willing and determined to throw away even his life in the attempt to serve the country by removing disabilities under which the vast number of those who belong to it labour, so that they may enjoy the full benefit of being Hindus and remain contented and happy members of the community.
('59', 498, 6, 14, 902793) It is equally necessary to say that sanatanists who do not agree with Mahatma Gandhi’s proposals or methods are not wanting in sympathy with the depressed classes.
('59', 498, 6, 15, 902957) This being so, I am confident that it is possible to arrive at a solution of the problem in conformity with the Shastras which should be acceptable to both sections of sanatanist opinion—more advanced and less advanced—and which should establish peace and religious unity among the Hindu community on a basis that will endure.
('59', 498, 7, 16, 903284) From statements recently made by Mahatma Gandhi, it is clear that he is not only willing, but anxious to show every respect for the orthodox opinion.
('59', 498, 8, 17, 903434) 1 Vide “Letter to Madan Mohan Malaviya”, 20 1 1933 and “Agreeing to Differ”, 18 2 1933
('59', 499, 0, 1, 903521) 500 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 499, 1, 2, 903563) From utterances of several esteemed exponents of sanatana dharma, it is also clear that they are willing to move forward to bring about an understanding which will be consistent with the Shastras.
('59', 499, 1, 3, 903760) This being so, I believe that, by dispassionate consideration of the Shastras by those who claim to expound them, it will be generally conceded, rules of action can be laid down which would secure the most liberal and practicable advance for the humblest Hindu and satisfaction to the most orthodox conservative opinion which is willing to act in conformity not merely with the letter, but also with the spirit of the Shastras.
('59', 499, 1, 4, 904188) I have convened the Mahasabha with the conviction that such a unity can be brought about among the sanatanist Hindus and appeal to all of them to make such contribution to the success of this effort as lies in their power.
('59', 499, 2, 5, 904411) To prevent misunderstanding, I wish to make the position clear.
('59', 499, 2, 6, 904475) Speaking in 1923 as the President of the Hindu Mahasabha of Holy Kashi in the presence of great gathering of learned and pious men, I pleaded that opportunity should be afforded even to the humblest Hindu to have a purifying and ennobling darshan of the deity
('59', 499, 3, 7, 904735) whom we adore in our temples and offer his prayer to Him.
('59', 499, 3, 8, 904793) I urged that this may be done in conformity with rules which may be laid down in that behalf and further urged that other disabilities from which the depressed classes suffered should be removed.
('59', 499, 3, 9, 904989) I still hold the same opinion and have publicly repeated it many times during the last few years and last few months, but have never been able to approve of recourse to satyagraha with the object of getting the temple opened to the depressed classes.
('59', 499, 3, 10, 905240) I do not think it right that this kind of pressure should be exerted in a matter where religious convictions and practices come into play.
('59', 499, 3, 11, 905379) Those who adhere to the orthodox view have also got their convictions which are deep seated and come down through the ages.
('59', 499, 3, 12, 905503) I believe that it is the sacred duty of those of us who differ from them to do our best to bring about a change of those convictions.
('59', 499, 3, 13, 905637) But by the very nature of the case, this duty demands that we should attempt it by resort to peaceful persuasion only.
('59', 499, 4, 14, 905756) This was laid down in a resolution which was passed by the Bombay public meeting held immediately after the Poona Pact over which I presided, and at which, the All India Anti untouchability League was established for the purpose of carrying on propaganda against untouchability.
('59', 499, 4, 15, 906035) That resolution stated that “for this purpose steps should immediately be taken to secure as early as possible that (a) all public wells, schools, roads, sarais, dharmashalas, crematoriums, burning ghats, etc., should be declared open to the depressed classes and (b) all public temples should be open to members of the depressed classes provided that for carrying out (a) and (b) no force or compulsion be used but resort shall be had only to peaceful persuasion.” It is both just and expedient that the solution of such a question should be one that would satisfy the community as a whole.
('59', 499, 4, 16, 906627) In my opinion, such a solution can be reached only
('59', 500, 0, 1, 906678) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 501
('59', 500, 1, 2, 906723) by the method of argument and persuasion with the help of those scholars who are versed in the Shastras and who desire the good of every section of the community.
('59', 500, 1, 3, 906886) It is to bring about such an agreement and solution that I have invited the special session of the Sanatana Dharma Mahasabha, and I am hoping and praying too that God will bless the attempt and crown it with success.
('59', 500, 2, 4, 907103) Towards this end, I intend to place the following concrete proposal before the Mahasabha, that for the uplift of the depressed classes, the following plan may be adopted: 
('59', 500, 3, 5, 907275) 1 (a) Samskar and updesh—initiation and instruction—known as diksha.
('59', 500, 3, 6, 907344) This will consist (a) of prayashchittam—penance and purification;
('59', 500, 4, 7, 907410) (b) tyag—giving up carrion and beef, leavings of dishes (uchchhishta), wine;
('59', 500, 5, 8, 907487) (c) diksha—receiving mantram, either ashtakshar mantram (with or without wearing tulsi bead); panchakshar mantram (with or without wearing rudraksha bead);
('59', 500, 6, 9, 907643) (d) Achara grahana—daily bath and daily prayer (morning and evening), daily
('59', 500, 7, 10, 907719) reading of the sacred book (teaching every man, woman and child to read and write will be an integral part of the scheme);
('59', 500, 8, 11, 907842) (e) vrata—vows—observing five necessary vows which are prescribed for all castes, ahimsa, satya, asteya, shaucham and indriyanigraha, (hurtlessness, truth,
('59', 500, 9, 12, 907998) non stealing, purity of body and mind, and control of senses);
('59', 500, 10, 13, 908061) 2 (a) freedom to join public meetings and public schools;
('59', 500, 11, 14, 908119) (b) use of public wells, roads, parks, sarais, dharmashalas, burning ghats, etc.; and
('59', 500, 12, 15, 908205) (c) entry into public temples for devadarshana and stuti.
('59', 500, 13, 16, 908263) If the scheme is approved, the giving of diksha should be completed
('59', 500, 14, 17, 908331) within a month.
('59', 500, 14, 18, 908347) The carrying out of this scheme will mean a great social, religious and spiritual uplift of the classes.
('59', 500, 14, 19, 908452) It will mean making them Harijans in the full sense of the term.
('59', 500, 14, 20, 908517) This will be only one of the proposals to be placed before the gathering of Acharyas and learned men.
('59', 500, 14, 21, 908619) There will be many proposals before them for their consideration.
('59', 500, 14, 22, 908685) There is every hope that with God’s grace result of deliberations will be one which will be welcomed with joy by all followers of sanatana dharma and all well wishers of humanity.

('59', 501, 4, 5, 908994) The Superintendent read the statement.
('59', 501, 4, 6, 909033) When Gandhiji woke up he said, “What do you propose to do now?
('59', 501, 4, 7, 909096) Let me know so that I may inform the Government.
('59', 501, 4, 8, 909145) But it would be better if you do not go on a fast now.”
('59', 501, 5, 9, 909201) BAPU: There is no Inner Voice urging me to go on a fast forthwith.
('59', 501, 5, 10, 909268) It would be regarded as an arbitrary action if I went on a fast now.
('59', 501, 5, 11, 909337) I am perturbed at the Viceroy’s decision, no doubt, but it is likely that my perturbation might be only temporary.
('59', 501, 5, 12, 909452) A fast might be in the offing but not now.
('59', 501, 5, 13, 909495) If it comes up in its natural course let it.
('59', 501, 5, 14, 909540) I cannot say when it will come.
('59', 501, 5, 15, 909572) I shall have to go on a fast only if I feel helpless—as I had been at the time of the Award when I resorted to a fast.
('59', 501, 5, 16, 909691) You can inform the Government that it is not my intention to go on a fast in the immediate future.
('59', 501, 5, 17, 909790) You have already seen my statement.
('59', 501, 5, 18, 909826) I have nothing in my heart over and above this statement.
('59', 501, 5, 19, 909884) Today I woke at 3 in the morning, and my mind was absolutely clear about what I had to write.

('59', 501, 10, 26, 910131) BAPU: Whatever the non Hindus might do is not likely to touch the core of
('59', 501, 11, 27, 910205) this injustice because the Harijans are still clinging to Hinduism.
('59', 501, 11, 28, 910273) I know how much
('59', 501, 12, 29, 910289) they are inter twined with Hinduism.
('59', 501, 12, 30, 910326) That is why I had poured out my heart in my
('59', 501, 13, 31, 910370) speech at the Round Table Conference.
('59', 501, 13, 32, 910408) In India the villages are mostly populated by
('59', 501, 14, 33, 910454) Hindus.
('59', 501, 14, 34, 910462) All the untouchables say that they are Hindus.
('59', 501, 14, 35, 910509) Quite a few do not even feel the
('59', 501, 15, 36, 910542) injustice.
('59', 501, 15, 37, 910553) They are in such a miserable plight that the thought of renouncing their
('59', 501, 16, 38, 910626) faith would not occur to them.
('59', 501, 16, 39, 910657) But I shall not be surprised if some day they set out to

('59', 502, 1, 2, 910933) BAPU: No, worse.
('59', 502, 1, 3, 910950) In the case of inferiority complex there is the consciousness of injustice being done.
('59', 502, 1, 4, 911037) But these people are not even aware of it.
('59', 502, 1, 5, 911080) That is why I say that if a non Hindu happens to be interested in this movement he should be prompted only by compassion.
('59', 502, 1, 6, 911202) If a non Hindu wants to help, he should associate himself with a Hindu organization before doing so.
('59', 502, 2, 7, 911303) G. I have been to the temples of South India.
('59', 502, 3, 8, 911349) BAPU: I want to stop this parody of Hinduism.
('59', 502, 3, 9, 911395) I want pure gold.
('59', 502, 3, 10, 911413) There will be political consequences of this activity, but I don’t at all think of political consequences.
('59', 502, 3, 11, 911520) I would engage myself in this activity even if there were to be no political consequences, I don’t care for them.
('59', 502, 3, 12, 911634) I want to bring about spiritual results and for that I am willing to sacrifice thousands of lives including mine.
('59', 502, 3, 13, 911748) This is a great injustice being done to a large section of the community.
('59', 502, 3, 14, 911822) To remove it we ought to work with a sense of atonement.
('59', 502, 3, 15, 911879) One should work with the feeling that one has committed an injustice and one must remove it oneself.
('59', 502, 3, 16, 911980) I don’t want a Gengiz Khan to descend upon us and threaten to cut the throats of the obstinate Savarnas and bring about this reform.

('59', 502, 9, 24, 912464) My position is wholly religious.
('59', 502, 9, 25, 912497) I cannot look at this thing from a political viewpoint.
('59', 502, 9, 26, 912553) I must have the Bill withdrawn if people are really opposed to it.
('59', 502, 9, 27, 912620) Then someone will tell me with the promptness of an arrow what I should do.
('59', 502, 9, 28, 912696) We certainly do not wish to enter temples stealthily.
('59', 502, 9, 29, 912750) Temple entry is definitely a spiritual act and it must bring about a revolution in society.
('59', 502, 9, 30, 912842) This whole idea of my fast is based on the belief that a large section of the people favour temple entry, but they do not voice it.
('59', 502, 9, 31, 912974) If people are on our side but the law is not, we can ask the trustees to break the law and to put up with it if someone were to bring an action against them under this law.
('59', 502, 10, 32, 913147) Bapu then stated that they should obtain a clear referendum in this regard.
('59', 502, 10, 33, 913223) But Bapu thought that even if it were to take three months the work must be
('59', 502, 11, 34, 913299) 1 Vide” Letter to K. Kelappan”, 28 1 1933 also footnote 3, “Letter to Ranachhoddas Patwari”, 11 1 1933
('59', 503, 0, 1, 913402) 504 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 503, 1, 2, 913444) accomplished in the area chosen.
('59', 503, 2, 3, 913477) BIRLA: In that case the best referendum is that there should be fresh elections to the Legislature on this issue.
('59', 503, 3, 4, 913591) BAPU: We would easily win them.
('59', 503, 3, 5, 913623) But that will not give us the ratio of the temple going Hindus’ vote.
('59', 503, 4, 6, 913693) Acharya invites us to go to the Varnashrama Swarajya Sangh.
('59', 503, 4, 7, 913753) He is involved in it.
('59', 503, 4, 8, 913775) And if we want to do so, we can, by capturing the Sangh and defeating him as it happened in 1921 when the Hindu Mahasabha was captured.
('59', 503, 4, 9, 913911) But whatever it is, it is intolerable that the Bill should hang fire for two years simply because it was being circulated among the members.
('59', 503, 5, 10, 914052) RAJAJI: Why should we object to it if the delay was due to the circulation of the Bill among the members?
('59', 503, 6, 11, 914158) BAPU: Because we know it is only an excuse and it is dishonest.
('59', 503, 6, 12, 914222) If as a result of the referendum public opinion suddenly sways in favour of the Bill I would press for its early passage.
('59', 503, 7, 13, 914344) Then they discussed the subject of Harijan Sevak.
('59', 503, 7, 14, 914394) Rajaji’s objections were: (1)
('59', 503, 8, 15, 914424) our journal will be read only by our own people whereas at present your statements are published in all the newspapers.
('59', 503, 8, 16, 914544) (2) The journal might prove useless.
('59', 503, 9, 17, 914581) BAPU: It is very necessary for training our workers and also for tying up all loose ends.
('59', 503, 9, 18, 914671) There are so many things which cannot be conveyed through A.P.I. In fact I wonder why you did not feel the necessity of a journal till now.
('59', 503, 10, 19, 914811) For conducting the referendum Birla suggested having pandits instead of laymen but added few men of character could be found among them.
('59', 503, 11, 20, 914948) BAPU: Then they are not needed.
('59', 503, 11, 21, 914980) Character means clinging steadfast to one’s beliefs.
('59', 503, 11, 22, 915033) The beliefs of a man who changes them for a higher fee have no worth.
('59', 503, 11, 23, 915103) I would of course choose to have a sincere pandit, but I would prefer a layman to a pandit who lacks character.
('59', 503, 13, 24, 915215) January 31, 1933
('59', 503, 14, 25, 915232) Vallabhbhai had a heated discussion continuing from the previous evening about a referendum and about utilizing Rajaji in upper India for this purpose.
('59', 503, 14, 26, 915384) [He argued] that a referendum as such could be of no use unless we have our further aims clarified.
('59', 503, 15, 27, 915484) BAPU: My doubt increases whether the people are firmly behind us.
('59', 503, 16, 28, 915550) VALLABHBHAI: We never had the opportunity to show it.
('59', 503, 17, 29, 915604) Yesterday Bapu had said to Rajaji that he would be able to advise him in this matter to a certain limit only.
('59', 504, 0, 1, 915714) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 505
('59', 504, 1, 2, 915759) RAJAJI: Since you have started this movement we must work for it.
('59', 504, 1, 3, 915825) But if the movement would work only if I were out of it I would prefer to quit.
('59', 504, 2, 4, 915905) BAPU: If you independently and dispassionately feel that you alone would be my representative in this movement you should regard this as a clear call to work for the movement and ought to continue the work without caring for public criticism.
('59', 504, 2, 5, 916148) But I always recite the verse: “Whoever, leaving secure things etc.” 1 to those who have the slightest doubt in their minds and tell them that they ought to give the benefit of the doubt to their initial pledge of civil disobedience.
('59', 504, 2, 6, 916382) But if you feel you have a clear call, and it seems you do, you must do Harijan work.
('59', 504, 3, 7, 916468) RAJAJI: Is the fast yet impending?
('59', 504, 4, 8, 916503) BAPU: Yes, it is unavoidable.
('59', 504, 4, 9, 916533) Looking at the happenings around I think the sooner it comes the better.
('59', 504, 4, 10, 916606) I have heard about a case at Kanpur.
('59', 504, 4, 11, 916643) Three Harijan candidates contested the Municipal Corporation election.
('59', 504, 4, 12, 916714) The other party sponsored none but three Harijan candidates to oppose them.
('59', 504, 4, 13, 916790) With the result that no Harijan was elected.
('59', 504, 4, 14, 916835) This has deeply hurt me.
('59', 504, 4, 15, 916860) I had girded up my loins against having reserved constituencies.
('59', 504, 4, 16, 916925) But now I think that had I been in Ambedkar’s place I would have opposed it much more violently.
('59', 504, 4, 17, 917022) In this Kanpur case they prevented the Harijans from winning only to safeguard their own interest.
('59', 504, 4, 18, 917121) The people should have only seen to it that three Harijan candidates win the election either for their own party or for the opposition.
('59', 504, 4, 19, 917257) This case is a clear violation of the Poona Pact.
('59', 504, 4, 20, 917307) I wrote to Hariji (Pandit Hriday Nath Kunzru).
('59', 504, 5, 21, 917354) He attempted to explain it with cool unconcern and informed me that he would further investigate it.
('59', 504, 5, 22, 917455) But I want no such investigation.
('59', 504, 5, 23, 917489) I have already told him to set right this injustice.
('59', 504, 6, 24, 917542) Birla and the others told Bapu that the Kanpur case was only an exception.
('59', 504, 6, 25, 917617) The Hindu society was undergoing a speedy change for the better.
('59', 504, 7, 26, 917682) BAPU: I do know it.
('59', 504, 7, 27, 917702) Such instances should not precipitate the fast.
('59', 504, 7, 28, 917750) But such incidents do upset me.
('59', 504, 7, 29, 917782) I am however consciously striving to postpone the ordeal of fast.
('59', 504, 8, 30, 917848) BIRLA: But once these Bills are passed wouldn’t there be an end to this question of the fast?
('59', 504, 9, 31, 917942) BAPU: No, my friend, not at all.
('59', 504, 9, 32, 917975) The fast does not depend solely on the Bills.
('59', 504, 9, 33, 918021) The question before me is not merely that of temple entry but the whole question [of untouchability].
('59', 504, 9, 34, 918123) Day after day I feel more and more that the likelihood of my fast is not diminishing but growing.
('59', 504, 9, 35, 918221) I cannot say why it is so.
('59', 504, 9, 36, 918248) I do not even know what will
('59', 504, 10, 37, 918277) 1 The verse runs as follows: “Whoever, leaving secure things runs after insecure ones loses the former, the latter being as good as lost.”
('59', 505, 0, 1, 918416) 506 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 505, 1, 2, 918458) precipitate it but this feeling is slowly but certainly growing.
('59', 505, 1, 3, 918523) I know this much that I am not at all at ease.
('59', 505, 1, 4, 918570) All these incidents taken as a whole fail to make a good impression on me.
('59', 505, 1, 5, 918645) True, some good things are also happening.
('59', 505, 1, 6, 918688) I cannot shut my eyes to them.
('59', 505, 1, 7, 918719) On the contrary, I try to close my eyes to unfavourable things.
('59', 505, 1, 8, 918783) For instance look at this nasty correspondence I am carrying on with these religious teachers and legal pandits.
('59', 505, 2, 9, 918896) BIRLA: But you should be content with the speed at which the reform is proceeding.
('59', 505, 3, 10, 918979) BAPU: Yes, those who have patience will be content.
('59', 505, 3, 11, 919031) But it does not at all comfort my heart.
('59', 505, 3, 12, 919072) I know our workers have plunged into activity, there is no lethargy in them.
('59', 505, 3, 13, 919149) But looking at the whole thing there is hardly anything that can satisfy my heart.
('59', 505, 4, 14, 919232) RAJAJI: .
('59', 505, 4, 15, 919242) To cut a long story short I may say that you have grown impatient.
('59', 505, 5, 16, 919309) BAPU: I know, as a practical man I must hold my patience.
('59', 505, 5, 17, 919367) There is no reason to be impatient.
('59', 505, 5, 18, 919403) Let me assure you that I entertain no such feeling.
('59', 505, 5, 19, 919455) I had taken no time to come to the decision before January 2 that I should not go on fast.
('59', 505, 5, 20, 919546) And let me inform you that some of my co workers are sore because I didn’t begin my fast on January 2. Only a few days ago a friend argued that no reasons had come up to postpone the fast which had already been decided upon.
('59', 505, 6, 21, 919771) RAJAJI: You have pampered all these co workers.
('59', 505, 6, 22, 919819) (Loud laughter)
('59', 505, 7, 23, 919835) BAPU: That is all right.
('59', 505, 7, 24, 919860) But there are others too who have condemned this postponement and they are not at all known to me.
('59', 505, 7, 25, 919959) One gentleman even went on an eleven day fast protesting against me.
('59', 505, 7, 26, 920028) I sent him a severe wire telling him that his fast was a sin and nothing less; only then did he give it up.
('59', 505, 7, 27, 920136) Hence as far as this question goes please believe me that I am struggling within myself.
('59', 505, 7, 28, 920225) Yet I cannot say to you that there will be no fast.
('59', 505, 7, 29, 920277) When I say this my friends in England do not get angry with me.
('59', 505, 7, 30, 920341) Whenever they have a doubt in their mind they try to believe that there must be God’s hand behind.
('59', 505, 7, 31, 920440) Andrews had written to me several times expressing his doubts.
('59', 505, 7, 32, 920503) Afterwards he wired to me cancelling all his letters and assured me that he had then understood the whole thing correctly.
('59', 505, 8, 33, 920626) Alluding to people’s superstitions, Rajaji said: Some people really believe that hitherto Gandhiji used to bring the rains but now he is committing an act owing to which the rains may fail.
('59', 505, 9, 34, 920816) BAPU: You are talking about the ignorant people.
('59', 505, 9, 35, 920865) But I have heaps of letters from people with B.A. and B.L. degrees, which are full of anger, bitterness, venom and abuses, besides superstition.
('59', 505, 10, 36, 921010) RAJAJI: This looks like a misalliance between legal expertise and a low class master.
('59', 505, 10, 37, 921096) (Laughter)
('59', 506, 0, 1, 921107) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 507
('59', 506, 1, 2, 921152) BAPU: My present feeling is that the possibility of the fast is not very far away.
('59', 506, 2, 3, 921235) How can I say when the fast will come up?
('59', 506, 2, 4, 921277) When I started my fast in Bombay in 1921, I abruptly woke up Mathuradas who was sleeping by my side and told him: ‘Don’t argue with me, this is my resolution., The same was the case with my 21 day fast—Hakimji, Mohammed Ali all were dazed.
('59', 506, 2, 5, 921517) But will anyone on that account say that the fast was wrong?
('59', 506, 2, 6, 921578) I for one think that the fast did achieve its object then, it will prove useful even after 5000 years.
('59', 506, 3, 7, 921681) Mathuradas then asked what a worker should do who felt bound to offer civil disobedience but was tired.
('59', 506, 4, 8, 921785) BAPU: It is difficult to tell.
('59', 506, 4, 9, 921816) But why shouldn’t such a person do Harijan work?
('59', 506, 4, 10, 921865) Of course there will be one condition, that he must declare that he is tired and that therefore instead of going to jail he wants to do Harijan work.
('59', 506, 4, 11, 922015) He cannot do Harijan work by concealing this fact.
('59', 506, 4, 12, 922066) Rather than doing Harijan work while concealing the truth he had better sit at home doing nothing.
('59', 506, 4, 13, 922165) There is courage in humbly confessing the truth.
('59', 506, 4, 14, 922214) Those who want to rest should declare it and say that they want to improve their health and till then they will do Harijan work.
('59', 506, 4, 15, 922343) The point is that one should not practise deceit.
('59', 506, 4, 16, 922393) Deceit will benefit neither Congress work, nor the work of civil disobedience nor untouchability work.

('59', 506, 7, 20, 922559) LETTER FROM GOVERNMENT OF INDIA1
('59', 506, 8, 21, 922592) [Before February 17, 1933]
('59', 506, 9, 22, 922619) The Governor General in Council has carefully considered the points urged by Mr. Gandhi in his letter of the 1st February 1933, addressed to the Private Secretary to the Viceroy, in which he requests that, for the reasons stated therein, the Government of India should facilitate the progress and passage of the Bills regarding temple entry, which will be introduced in the Assembly by Mr. Ranga Iyer and others.
('59', 506, 9, 23, 923032) He is unable to accept the arguments developed by Mr. Gandhi relating to the Poona Pact, and notes that the Resolution he has quoted did not form part of the Pact as communicated to the Government of India.
('59', 506, 9, 24, 923239) In the matter of the Pact, Government
('59', 506, 10, 25, 923277) 1 This was received on February 17. Vide “Letter to C. F. Andrews”, 1 2 1933, “Letter to C. F. Andrews”, 17 2 1933 and “Letter to Home Secretary, Government of India”, 19 2 1933
('59', 507, 0, 1, 923455) 508 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 507, 1, 2, 923497) were concerned merely to accept a modification of the representation in the Legislatures which had been provided in the Communal Award by His Majesty’s Government.
('59', 507, 1, 3, 923661) But quite apart from the Pact, the Government for many years have taken an active interest in the improvement of the conditions under which the depressed classes live.
('59', 507, 1, 4, 923829) That interest has been directed to the matters referred to in the Resolution which he quotes, such as education and the provision of the normal facilities of life, which were placed in the forefront of the Resolution but appear not to be regarded by him as the vital part of it.
('59', 507, 1, 5, 924108) The Government have naturally taken no initiative in matters which specifically affect religious practice.
('59', 507, 1, 6, 924215) In regard to that, they have nothing to add to the statement issued to the Press on 23rd January.
('59', 507, 1, 7, 924313) They must reiterate that in their opinion it is essential that the consideration of a measure, which so closely affects the religious customs and usages of the Hindu community, should not proceed unless the proposals are subjected to the fullest examination in all their aspects, not merely in the Legislatures, but also outside it, by all who will be affected by them.
('59', 507, 1, 8, 924683) This purpose can only be satisfied if the Bill is circulated in the widest manner for the purpose of eliciting public opinion, and if adequate time is given to enable all classes of Hindus to form and express their considered views.

('59', 507, 4, 12, 925007) DISCUSSION WITH B. R. AMBEDKAR1
('59', 507, 5, 13, 925039) February 4, 1933
('59', 507, 6, 14, 925056) Discussing the propriety or otherwise of Ranga Iyer’s two Bills [Ambedkar] said: The one paragraph Bill is a very simple one.
('59', 507, 6, 15, 925182) Its fair point lies in admitting that this custom is immoral.
('59', 507, 6, 16, 925244) There is no such admission in the second Bill.
('59', 507, 7, 17, 925291) BAPU: No, it is there in its preamble.
('59', 507, 8, 18, 925330) A. But it is not clear.
('59', 507, 8, 19, 925354) I also think that the two Bills do not go together.
('59', 507, 9, 20, 925406) BAPU: The one paragraph Bill is certainly superior to the other.
('59', 507, 9, 21, 925471) But the other lengthier Bill was brought forward because the first one could not be introduced in the Provincial Legislature.
('59', 507, 9, 22, 925597) There is no contradiction in the two Bills.
('59', 507, 9, 23, 925641) In one Bill untouchability ceases to be a disability and the law refuses to accept the argument based on untouchability.
('59', 507, 9, 24, 925762) As a result of the second Bill, temple authorities are obliged to take steps under certain circumstances.
('59', 507, 9, 25, 925868) If we can get both the Bills passed the trustees will not be able to put up any kind of obstacle.
('59', 507, 9, 26, 925966) I take it upon myself to have all the temples opened within one month if we could get both the Bills passed.
('59', 507, 10, 27, 926075) 1 Vide “Dr. Ambedkar and Caste”, 7 2 1933

('59', 508, 1, 2, 926162) sanatanists would prefer the second Bill.
('59', 508, 1, 3, 926204) But speaking as a sincere sanatanist I would prefer the first Bill.
('59', 508, 2, 4, 926272) Now the Government will have to issue orders against the sanatanists under Section 144 because they would be regarded as interfering with untouchables’ rights.
('59', 508, 3, 5, 926432) BAPU: However, I want you now to emphatically proclaim your ideas in very clear words.
('59', 508, 4, 6, 926519) As far as we are concerned we have no immediate concern other than securing political power .
('59', 508, 4, 7, 926613) and that alone is the solution of our problem.
('59', 508, 5, 8, 926660) We want our social status raised in the eyes of the savarna Hindus.
('59', 508, 6, 9, 926728) There is another point of view also.
('59', 508, 6, 10, 926765) The object of this effort could be that you want the depressed classes to be retained in the Hindu religion, in which case I am inclined to believe that it is not sufficient in the present awakened state of the depressed classes.
('59', 508, 6, 11, 926995) If I call myself a Hindu I am obliged to accept that by birth I belong to a low caste.
('59', 508, 6, 12, 927082) Hence I think I must ask the Hindus to show me some sacred authority which would rule out this feeling of lowliness.
('59', 508, 6, 13, 927199) If it cannot be I should say goodbye to Hinduism.
('59', 508, 6, 14, 927249) I am not going to be satisfied with measures which would merely bring some relief.
('59', 508, 6, 15, 927332) I don’t want to be crushed by your charity.
('59', 508, 7, 16, 927376) BAPU : I have nothing to say if you have come with a final decision that you are not going to move your little finger to have this Bill passed.
('59', 508, 8, 17, 927520) A. We have not made any decision.
('59', 508, 8, 18, 927554) However, I have shown you how my mind is working.
('59', 508, 9, 19, 927604) BAPU : I told you that I could have nothing to say if you have already taken a decision.
('59', 508, 10, 20, 927693) A. We cannot ask the savarna Hindus to decide for themselves whether or not
('59', 508, 11, 21, 927769) we are a part of them.
('59', 508, 11, 22, 927792) You ought to demonstrate your determination by getting these Bills passed.
('59', 508, 12, 23, 927867) BAPU: I am not asking you to do anything.
('59', 508, 12, 24, 927909) I never wanted the depressed people to go on their knees to the savarna Hindus and ask them to get these Bills
('59', 508, 13, 25, 928020) passed.
('59', 508, 13, 26, 928028) Unfortunately, the solution of this problem is in the hands of a third power which is in a position to mend or worsen the situation.
('59', 508, 14, 27, 928161) A. I can set right the thing.
('59', 508, 15, 28, 928191) BAPU: That is right.
('59', 508, 15, 29, 928212) Of course I agree with you that it does not behove your dignity to approach the Hindus.
('59', 508, 15, 30, 928300) I take the position—you might remember since I made the speech at the Round Table Conference—that we should atone for this.
('59', 508, 15, 31, 928424) If you repudiate us and go away I would think that we only deserved it.
('59', 508, 16, 32, 928496) A. The Bill mentions temple entry but it makes no mention of entry into the sanctum sanctorum.
('59', 508, 16, 33, 928591) Will they let a member of the depressed community place flowers
('59', 509, 0, 1, 928655) 510 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 509, 1, 2, 928697) on the idol, or will they let him offer a tray containing oblations?
('59', 509, 1, 3, 928766) Malaviyaji has already declared that question of offering puja does not arise.
('59', 509, 2, 4, 928845) BAPU : Temple entry is meant for puja if anything.
('59', 509, 2, 5, 928896) But if the language of the Bill is not right it can be amended and we can say ‘entry for the purpose of puja’.
('59', 509, 3, 6, 929007) seems there has been some misunderstanding somewhere in the case of Malaviyaji.
('59', 509, 3, 7, 929087) He would not say what you attribute to him.
('59', 509, 3, 8, 929131) Flowers, sweets or any other offerings from Harijans will surely be accepted.
('59', 509, 3, 9, 929209) So we two agree on this point that there is no question of your imploring the savarna Hindus.
('59', 509, 3, 10, 929303) When some savarna Hindus tell me
('59', 509, 4, 11, 929336) that Harijans do not want to enter the temples I ask them to throw open the temple doors for the Harijans whether or not they wish to come in.
('59', 509, 4, 12, 929479) They ought to have the satisfaction that they have done their duty.
('59', 509, 4, 13, 929547) They ought to discharge the debt which they owe whether the creditor keeps it or throws it into the gutter.
('59', 509, 4, 14, 929655) But I must say that you ought not to say that you are not a Hindu.
('59', 509, 4, 15, 929722) In accepting the Poona Pact you accept the position that you are Hindus.
('59', 509, 5, 16, 929795) A. I have accepted only the political aspect of it.
('59', 509, 6, 17, 929847) BAPU : You cannot escape the situation that you are Hindus in spite of your statement to the contrary.
('59', 509, 7, 18, 929950) A. We ask of you that our silence should not be misconstrued.
('59', 509, 7, 19, 930012) After that I accept your point.
('59', 509, 8, 20, 930044) BAPU: I go one step further.
('59', 509, 8, 21, 930073) You will not be able to go ahead a single step unless you maintain your position absolutely correct.
('59', 509, 8, 22, 930174) I regard temple entry as a spiritual matter through which everything else will bear fruit.
('59', 509, 9, 23, 930265) A. The Hindu mind does not work in a rational way.
('59', 509, 9, 24, 930316) They have no objection to the untouchables touching them on the railway and other public places.
('59', 509, 9, 25, 930413) Why do they object to it only in the case of temples?
('59', 509, 10, 26, 930467) BAPU: We are well caught on this point.
('59', 509, 10, 27, 930507) I take up the question of temple entry first of all because these people want to cling to untouchability in the temples.
('59', 509, 10, 28, 930628) Many sanatanist Hindus say that they would admit Harijans in schools and public places but not in temples.
('59', 509, 10, 29, 930735) I ask them to grant the Harijans equal status before God.
('59', 509, 10, 30, 930793) It will raise their status.
('59', 509, 11, 31, 930821) A. Supposing we are lucky in the case of temple entry, will they let us fetch water from the wells?
('59', 509, 12, 32, 930921) BAPU: Sure.
('59', 509, 12, 33, 930933) This is bound to follow it.
('59', 509, 12, 34, 930961) And it is also very easy.

('59', 510, 2, 3, 931095) A TALK1
('59', 510, 3, 4, 931103) February 13, 1933
('59', 510, 4, 5, 931121) Like Angada and Krishna who had gone with the message of truce, we approach these legislators and the Government.
('59', 510, 4, 6, 931235) Justice can be demanded from any source and that, too, forcefully.
('59', 510, 4, 7, 931302) We fail in dharma if we do not demand justice.
('59', 510, 4, 8, 931349) What does the pledge taken at Bombay imply?
('59', 510, 4, 9, 931393) [It implies that] as far as possible we will abolish untouchability by law before the attainment of swaraj.
('59', 510, 4, 10, 931501) We do not want to accomplish anything by force.
('59', 510, 4, 11, 931549) I do not want to achieve it by undertaking a fast—God will make me undertake one [sooner or later]—for it is likely that I might be deluded into describing it as inspired by God.
('59', 510, 4, 12, 931728) Kelappan had said to me that the temple would be thrown open within a couple of days.
('59', 510, 4, 13, 931814) Yet I told him that though it might help throw open the temple immediately how could we continue a fast that was initiated on unjust grounds.
('59', 510, 5, 14, 931956) Now remains the question of the law.
('59', 510, 5, 15, 931993) I for one want no laws.
('59', 510, 5, 16, 932017) I am an anarchist.
('59', 510, 5, 17, 932036) Bat I want to act within the limits of the law.
('59', 510, 5, 18, 932084) In this case we want a law enacted in order to undo another.
('59', 510, 5, 19, 932145) At present the decision of the law courts has become as good as the shruti (Revelation) and the Government is the God who reveals it.
('59', 510, 5, 20, 932279) Therefore we
('59', 510, 6, 21, 932292) ask the Government to repeal it.
('59', 510, 6, 22, 932325) Let us take the first Bill.
('59', 510, 6, 23, 932353) The Invisible Power will punish breach of a religious commandment, a ruler does not have this authority.
('59', 510, 6, 24, 932458) The wholly Hindu State might acquire this authority.
('59', 510, 6, 25, 932511) But in the present case it is the Government which inflicts punishment for breach of a religious injunction.
('59', 510, 6, 26, 932620) This is gross injustice.
('59', 510, 6, 27, 932645) We must have it removed and thus follow our dharma.
('59', 510, 6, 28, 932697) How long can we keep it pending?
('59', 510, 6, 29, 932730) Whether it is a mixed legislature or even a Muslim Government, we should have it passed by them.
('59', 510, 6, 30, 932827) Today we cannot follow our dharma.
('59', 510, 6, 31, 932862) Even where the trustees are willing to throw open the temple the law forbids them from doing so.
('59', 510, 6, 32, 932959) Now have I any other course open?
('59', 510, 6, 33, 932993) Hence the Bill.
('59', 510, 6, 34, 933009) With the passage of this Bill no one believing in untouchability will be compelled to give it up.
('59', 510, 6, 35, 933107) I am this day prepared to give in writing that unless the sanatanists are willing to throw open the temples they will not be forced to do so.
('59', 510, 7, 36, 933249) By fighting we can get justice even from anti national Government— rather it becomes our dharma.
('59', 510, 7, 37, 933346) Malaviyaji is a Yudhishthira.
('59', 510, 7, 38, 933376) He is always in doubt.
('59', 510, 7, 39, 933399) In his perpetual anxiety to follow the dictates of dharma, he often fails to follow it at all.
('59', 510, 7, 40, 933494) Vyasa had such wonderful power.
('59', 510, 7, 41, 933526) He depicts Yudhishthira as a rather weak person; yet
('59', 510, 8, 42, 933579) 1 On Madan Mohan Malaviya’s objection to the Bills; vide “Drafta Telegraam toa C. Rajagopalchari”, 13 2 1933

('59', 511, 1, 2, 933730) he is Dharmaraja.
('59', 511, 1, 3, 933748) In the same sense Malaviyaji also is a Dharmaraja.
('59', 511, 1, 4, 933799) We can never give him up.
('59', 511, 1, 5, 933825) He has boundless love for me and whenever he loses in an argument he thinks that there must be some truth in what I say.

('59', 512, 22, 30, 937080) B. R. AMBEDKAR’S STATEMENT1
('59', 512, 23, 31, 937108) Although the controversy regarding the question of temple entry is confined to the sanatanists and Mahatma Gandhi, the Depressed Classes have undoubtedly a very important part to play in it, in so far as their position is bound to weigh the scale one way or the other, when the issue comes for a final settlement.
('59', 512, 23, 32, 937422) It is, therefore, necessary that their viewpoint should be defined and stated so as to leave no ambiguity about it.
('59', 512, 24, 33, 937538) To the Temple entry Bill of Mr. Ranga Iyer as now drafted, the Depressed Classes cannot possibly give their support.
('59', 512, 24, 34, 937655) The principle of the Bill is that if a majority of municipal and local board voters in the vicinity of any particular temple on a referendum decide by a majority that the Depressed Classes shall be allowed to enter the temple, the trustees or the manager of the temple shall give effect to that decision.
('59', 512, 24, 35, 937960) The principle is an ordinary principle of majority rule, and there is nothing
('59', 512, 25, 36, 938038) 1 Vide “Interview to Associated Press”, 14 2 1933 and “Letter to C. Rajagopalachari”, 22 2 1933
('59', 513, 0, 1, 938134) 514 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 513, 1, 2, 938176) radical or revolutionary about the Bill, and if the sanatanists were a wise lot they would accept it without demur.
('59', 513, 2, 3, 938292) The reasons why the Depressed Classes cannot support a Bill based upon this principle are two.
('59', 513, 2, 4, 938387) One reason is that the Bill cannot hasten the day of temple entry for the Depressed Classes any nearer than otherwise would be the case.
('59', 513, 2, 5, 938524) It is true that under the Bill, the minority will not have the right to obtain an injunction against the trustee, or the manager who throws open the temple to the Depressed Classes in accordance with the decision of the majority.
('59', 513, 2, 6, 938754) But before one can draw any satisfaction from this clause and congratulate the author of the Bill, one must first of all feel assured that when the question is put to the vote, there will be a majority in favour of templeentry.
('59', 513, 2, 7, 938982) If one is not suffering from illusions of any kind, one must accept that the hope of a majority voting in favour of temple entry will be very rarely realized if at all.
('59', 513, 2, 8, 939151) Without doubt, the majority is definitely opposed today—a fact which is conceded by the author of the Bill himself in his correspondence with the Shankaracharya.
('59', 513, 3, 9, 939313) What is there in the situation as created after the passing of the Bill, which can lead one to hope that the majority will act differently?
('59', 513, 3, 10, 939453) I find nothing.
('59', 513, 3, 11, 939469) I shall, no doubt, be reminded of the results of the referendum with regard to the Guruvayur Temple.
('59', 513, 3, 12, 939570) But I refuse to accept a referendum, so overweighted as it was by the life of Mahatma Gandhi, as the normal result.
('59', 513, 3, 13, 939686) In any such calculations, the life of the Mahatma must necessarily be deducted.
('59', 513, 4, 14, 939766) If Hindu religion is to be a religion of social equality, then an amendment of its code to provide temple entry is not enough.
('59', 513, 4, 15, 939893) What is required is to purge it of the doctrine of chaturvarnya.

('59', 513, 8, 19, 940033) DEHRA DUN JAIL, January 5, 1933
('59', 513, 9, 20, 940065) MY DEAR BAPU,
('59', 513, 10, 21, 940079) Your letter is always a tonic, and when it comes after a long interval, it brings
('59', 513, 11, 22, 940161) a thrill with it and its effect is all the more exhilarating.
('59', 513, 11, 23, 940223) I recognized Mahadev’s
('59', 513, 12, 24, 940246) handwriting on the envelope.
('59', 513, 12, 25, 940275) Yours did not seem as of old.
('59', 513, 12, 26, 940305) Perhaps your left hand was
('59', 513, 13, 27, 940332) functioning and I am not so familiar with it.
('59', 513, 14, 28, 940378) 1 Vide “Letter to Jawaharlal Nehru”, 15 2 1933
('59', 514, 0, 1, 940425) VOL. 59 : 13 JANUARY, 1933 9 MARCH, 1933 515
('59', 514, 1, 2, 940470) I am following of course with great interest your campaign against untouchability, as far as I can from The statesman and the Pioneer.
('59', 514, 1, 3, 940605) Anything that you
('59', 514, 2, 4, 940623) may do is bound to interest and fascinate.
('59', 514, 2, 5, 940666) The subject itself has tremendous possibilities.
('59', 514, 2, 6, 940715) Not being a man of religion, my interest is largely confined to the social aspect and to the wider issues involved.
('59', 514, 3, 7, 940831) Of course Sarup should do untouchability work if she feels like it.
('59', 514, 3, 8, 940899) My suggestion about a short holiday in Ceylon was made chiefly in the interest of Krishna.
('59', 514, 3, 9, 940990) I am a little worried about her.
('59', 514, 3, 10, 941023) After a year in prison, with our home practically broken up, she feels rather at a loose end and does not know what to do.
('59', 514, 3, 11, 941146) Ever since her childhood the poor girl has been deprived of real home life and proper education because of our preoccupations and repeated visits to prison.
('59', 514, 3, 12, 941303) She grew up a rather lonely girl not having as much friendship and sympathy as she was entitled to.
('59', 514, 4, 13, 941403) Father’s death shook her up a great deal.
('59', 514, 4, 14, 941445) I tried to soothe her and win her confidence and I am glad to say that I succeeded to some extent.
('59', 514, 4, 15, 941544) But 1931 was for all of us a year full of work and worry and anxiety.
('59', 514, 4, 16, 941614) Then came a long spell of prison for her, and for a young girl this was a far greater ordeal than it could be for most of us.
('59', 514, 4, 17, 941740) As her release drew near I sensed how she must be feeling and how life in Anand Bhawan as it is today would be no joy to her.
('59', 514, 4, 18, 941866) She would feel out of joint.
('59', 514, 4, 19, 941895) She would want to do something and yet not know what to do, and this would rob her of peace of mind.
('59', 514, 4, 20, 941996) I was myself not clear what to suggest to her.
('59', 514, 4, 21, 942043) Latterly she has begun to look upon me almost as a kind of refuge in a friendless world.
('59', 514, 4, 22, 942132) If I had been out I might have been of help to her but I could do little from Dehra Dun Jail.
('59', 514, 5, 23, 942226) I felt that a short holiday in neutral surroundings would ease her mind and remove the tension.
('59', 514, 5, 24, 942322) Hence my proposal about Ceylon.
('59', 514, 5, 25, 942354) Three weeks in Ceylon would not have solved any problem but she would have freshened up and returned with a brighter outlook on life.
('59', 514, 5, 26, 942488) These were my reasons.
('59', 514, 5, 27, 942511) I was thinking more of mental health than of physical health.
('59', 514, 5, 28, 942573) But the proposal seems to have fallen through as nobody seems to be keen on it.
('59', 514, 5, 29, 942653) In the present, therefore, Ceylon is off.
('59', 514, 6, 30, 942695) Perhaps Krishna will go to Poona to see you and you might be able to advise her about her work.
('59', 514, 6, 31, 942791) I might see her also.
('59', 514, 6, 32, 942813) It is easy enough to suggest odd bits of work but this must appeal to the person concerned.
('59', 514, 7, 33, 942905) As for my interviews, it is now nearly seven months since I had one.
('59', 514, 7, 34, 942974) I have missed them greatly but the U. P. Govt.
('59', 514, 7, 35, 943021) had been very discourteous to Mother and Kamala and I felt that I had no alternative; besides I have not yet got rid of my obstinacy—a hereditary failing in me of which you cannot be unaware.
('59', 514, 7, 36, 943213) The Government made some partial amends and the Home Member, the Nawab of Chhatari, came and expressed his concern.
('59', 514, 7, 37, 943329) All this was more or less beside the point and the graceful thing and the right thing was not done, but then the right thing is seldom done.
('59', 514, 7, 38, 943470) I wrote again to Government.
('59', 514, 7, 39, 943499) Still I decided in my mind that should
('59', 515, 0, 1, 943538) 516 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 515, 1, 2, 943580) special necessity arise I would withdraw my prohibition and consent to an interview.
('59', 515, 1, 3, 943665) So matters have stood for the last few weeks.
('59', 515, 1, 4, 943711) I did not suggest an early interview as there was some talk of my transfer back to Naini Prison.
('59', 515, 2, 5, 943808) Now that you have also written about it, what can I do but immediately to capitulate to you?
('59', 515, 2, 6, 943901) So henceforth, and unless something untoward intervenes, I shall take my usual interviews.
('59', 515, 2, 7, 943992) Kamala may not be able to see me for several weeks still.
('59', 515, 2, 8, 944050) She [ is] in Calcutta under Bidhan’s treatment.
('59', 515, 2, 9, 944098) But I shall see Mother and Indu and Sarup and Krishna or such of them as can find me.
('59', 515, 3, 10, 944184) The stopping of interviews has made me retire a little more into myself.
('59', 515, 3, 11, 944257) But I have had pleasing and a friendly neighbour—the Himalayas.
('59', 515, 3, 12, 944321) The sight of their outline against the sky, and now their summits and sides covered with fresh snow, have meant a geat deal to me.
('59', 515, 3, 13, 944452) They seem to rouse in me ancient memories of the long ago when perhaps my ancestors wandered about the mountains of Kashmir and played in their snow and glaciers.
('59', 515, 3, 14, 944615) I have had companions here but largely I have been left to myself, and I have grown a little contemplative, in defiance of heredity and family tradition and personal habit!
('59', 515, 3, 15, 944788) But that is a thin veneer which I am afraid will rub off at little provocation.
('59', 515, 3, 16, 944868) How can the Ethiopian change his skin?
('59', 515, 4, 17, 944907) I have read a lot, and if wisdom could be had in books I would be wise.
('59', 515, 4, 18, 944979) But wisdom eludes me, and big question marks confront me wherever I look.
('59', 515, 4, 19, 945053) Sometimes I think of Prince Siddhartha’s old question and no answer comes:
('59', 515, 5, 20, 945128) How can it be that Brahma
('59', 515, 6, 21, 945154) Would make a world and keep it miserable,
('59', 515, 7, 22, 945196) Since, if all powerful He leaves it so,
('59', 515, 8, 23, 945236) He is not good, and if not powerful,
('59', 515, 9, 24, 945273) He is not God?
('59', 515, 10, 25, 945288) From all accounts in the papers you are as ever the slave of industry and are over working yourself even in prison.
('59', 515, 10, 26, 945404) The new industrial system of the West is often criticized and blamed because it makes man a machine for ceaseless work and robs him of all leisure.
('59', 515, 10, 27, 945552) You are supposed to be no lover of this system.
('59', 515, 10, 28, 945600) And yet, you seem to personify to me often this very industrial system !
('59', 515, 11, 29, 945673) I am intrigued at your remark that eye witnesses have told you that I am keeping fit.
('59', 515, 11, 30, 945759) The information is correct but who could these eye witnesses be who have managed to reach you?
('59', 515, 11, 31, 945854) I have had no interviews for a long while and, except for a colleague who was discharged a month ago, I can think of no other likely recent eye witness.
('59', 515, 11, 32, 946007) It is true that I am poorer by four teeth.
('59', 515, 11, 33, 946050) I have sacrificed them at the altar of modern science to appease the goddess of physical health.
('59', 515, 12, 34, 946147) This is a long letter for gaol.
('59', 515, 12, 35, 946179) But this I am writing to you after over a year and I have not seen you for over sixteen months.
('59', 515, 12, 36, 946275) My last glimpse of you was when you

('59', 516, 1, 2, 946356) were sailing away to the far West and your figure grew smaller and smaller as the ship bore you away and left us, feeling rather lonely and forlorn, on the pier.
('59', 516, 2, 3, 946518) With my love to all the happy family of yours in Yeravda.
('59', 516, 3, 4, 946576) Yours affectionately,

('59', 516, 6, 6, 946669) APPENDIX XV
('59', 516, 7, 7, 946681) TALK WITH MATHURADAS1
('59', 516, 8, 8, 946703) February 18, 1933
('59', 516, 9, 9, 946721) [BAPU]: It is true that according to the Vedas the Shudras have no privileges; mainly they speak of only three varnas.
('59', 516, 9, 10, 946840) However, the Vedas which are available to us are not the only ones.
('59', 516, 9, 11, 946908) Of the thousands of books only a few have come down to us.
('59', 516, 9, 12, 946967) There is religion as well as history in the Vedas.
('59', 516, 9, 13, 947018) And history is not religion.
('59', 516, 9, 14, 947047) The part dealing with religion is timeless and eternal whereas the one dealing with history describes the circumstances then prevailing.
('59', 516, 9, 15, 947184) Who knows how long I have to live?
('59', 516, 9, 16, 947219) But if I had no other task to demand my attention, I would certainly wish to take up the work of varnashramadharma.
('59', 516, 9, 17, 947335) But the establishment of varnadharma needs the foundation of ashramadharma without which the whole structure would necessarily be weak.
('59', 516, 9, 18, 947471) There is contentment at the root of varnashramadharma.
('59', 516, 9, 19, 947526) It implies willing acceptance of one’s dharma and karma.
('59', 516, 9, 20, 947583) Therefore varnashramadharma is a divine way of life whereas all the others are demoniac ones.
('59', 516, 9, 21, 947677) Varnashramadharma has nobility as its predominant quality whereas the others are dominated by calculated selfishness.
('59', 516, 10, 22, 947795) Once this law is understood many other things will follow.
('59', 516, 10, 23, 947854) If we know how to drink water but do not know the science behind it, then it is of no use.
('59', 516, 10, 24, 947945) If we know the various forms of water such as snow, vapour and hydro electricity, then we can be said to have understood the science of water.
('59', 516, 10, 25, 948088) Similar is the case with varnashrama.
('59', 516, 10, 26, 948126) This is a principle applicable in all cases.
('59', 516, 11, 27, 948171) [M.D.]: In other words, as Muslims claim that Islam means peace, and that it is the universal law meant for the whole world, you say that varnashramadharma is the universal law.
('59', 516, 12, 28, 948349) BAPU: Yes, it is in the same sense.
('59', 516, 12, 29, 948385) Every religion has some eternal principles and the followers of a particular religion follow their dharma in that measure.
('59', 516, 12, 30, 948508) The rest of their religion is related to the circumstances of time and place.
('59', 516, 13, 31, 948586) I would give up varnashramadharma this very day, were it not connected with
('59', 516, 14, 32, 948662) 1 Vide “Letter to Motilal Roy”, 18 2 1933.
('59', 517, 0, 1, 948705) 518 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('59', 517, 1, 2, 948747) What would otherwise be left in it?
('59', 517, 1, 3, 948783) I would maintain that the correct thing would be that the son of a carpenter should be a carpenter and not a blacksmith.
('59', 517, 1, 4, 948904) If as a result there are to be hundreds of castes, let there be.
('59', 517, 1, 5, 948969) So long as there is inter dining and intermarrying among them let there be any number of castes.
('59', 517, 1, 6, 949066) The restrictions about dining and marriage have turned the whole thing into a wretched affair.
('59', 517, 2, 7, 949161) I would certainly say that Dronacharya had fallen from dharma.
('59', 517, 2, 8, 949224) What I mean is not that a member of one varna may never follow the profession of another varna, but that it is not proper.
('59', 517, 2, 9, 949347) This varnashramadharma as I propound it is for everybody to follow not blindly but after due deliberation.
('59', 517, 2, 10, 949454) Like Hindus, Muslims also may follow it.
('59', 517, 2, 11, 949495) It was in this sense that I described it as ‘Hinduism’s greatest gift to mankind’.
('59', 517, 2, 12, 949578) With the observance of this dharma the entire community will be saved and it will become invincible.

('59', 517, 7, 18, 949832) Why do they shun your touch, my friend, and call you unclean?
('59', 517, 8, 19, 949894) Whom cleanliness follows at every step, making the earth and air sweet for our dwelling, and ever luring us back from return to the wild?
('59', 517, 9, 20, 950032) You help us, like a mother her child, into freshness, and uphold the truth, that disgust is never for man.
('59', 517, 10, 21, 950139) The holy stream of your ministry carries pollution’s away and ever remains pure.
('59', 517, 11, 22, 950220) Once Lord Siva had saved the world from a deluge of poison by taking it himself.
('59', 517, 12, 23, 950301) And you save it every day from filth with the same divine sufferance.
('59', 517, 13, 24, 950371) Come friend, come my hero, give us courage to serve man, even while bearing the brand of infamy from him.
