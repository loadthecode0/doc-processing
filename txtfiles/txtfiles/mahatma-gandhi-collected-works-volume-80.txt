('80', 0, 2, 3, 72) December 28, 1940
('80', 0, 3, 4, 90) DEAR MR. MOORE 1, Many thanks for your reasoned letter.
('80', 0, 3, 5, 146) I see that we cannot agree as to facts and, where we agree, we view them from different angles of vision.
('80', 0, 3, 6, 252) Therefore we must for the time being agree to differ.
('80', 0, 3, 7, 306) ‘We shall know each other better when the mists have rolled away.’ I know that our friendship can easily bear the strain of our differences.
('80', 0, 3, 8, 447) With compliments of the season.

('80', 1, 6, 9, 1519) MY DEAR PROFESSOR,
('80', 1, 7, 10, 1538) Why do you complain about my dealing directly with the Presidents and issuing Press notes?
('80', 1, 7, 11, 1629) There is nothing irregular in this.
('80', 1, 7, 12, 1665) And how cumbersome to do all these things through you?
('80', 1, 7, 13, 1720) Mahadev might have sent you copies.
('80', 1, 7, 14, 1756) But you will pity him if you saw him at work.
('80', 1, 7, 15, 1802) And if and when he too goes!
('80', 1, 7, 16, 1831) You are overdue.
('80', 1, 7, 17, 1848) I sent you a wire in reply to your letter.
('80', 1, 7, 18, 1891) No reply and no Kripalani!

('80', 2, 1, 2, 2308) I have heard that Sushila 1 visited you.
('80', 2, 1, 3, 2349) You must, therefore, have come to know everything.
('80', 2, 1, 4, 2400) Bhagavat 2 also had written to me.
('80', 2, 1, 5, 2435) Sarojinidevi 3 also had told me that spinning, prayers and so on were going on regularly.
('80', 2, 1, 6, 2525) I hope that all the women will come out [of jail] with good health after having acquired great skill in constructive work.
('80', 2, 1, 7, 2648) Prabhavati is here.
('80', 2, 1, 8, 2668) She travelled a lot with Jayaprakash.
('80', 2, 1, 9, 2706) She has been here for three days.
('80', 2, 1, 10, 2740) Jayaprakash will come either today or tomorrow and take her away.
('80', 2, 1, 11, 2806) She has benefited by your teaching and your guidance.
('80', 2, 1, 12, 2860) She will start her work from January 1. She had gone out taking one month’s leave.
('80', 2, 1, 13, 2943) Don’t be guided by newspaper reports about my health.
('80', 2, 1, 14, 2997) I am quite all right.
('80', 2, 1, 15, 3019) I am taking care of my health.
('80', 2, 1, 16, 3050) So long as God wishes to take work from me, He will keep me in health.
('80', 2, 1, 17, 3121) Ba is with me.
('80', 2, 1, 18, 3136) She is calm.

('80', 2, 5, 24, 3371) SEVAGRAM, WARDHA, December 29, 1940
('80', 2, 6, 25, 3407) MY DEAR SUBHAS, You are irrepressible whether ill or well.
('80', 2, 6, 26, 3466) Do get well before going in for fireworks.
('80', 2, 6, 27, 3509) I have not been in consultation with Maulana Saheb.
('80', 2, 6, 28, 3561) But, when I read in the papers about the decision, I could not help approving of it.
('80', 2, 6, 29, 3646) I am surprised that you won’t distinguish between discipline and indiscipline.
('80', 2, 7, 30, 3725) 1 Sushila Pai 2 Manager, Saswad Ashram 3 Sarojini Naidu 4 This was in reply to the addressee’s letter dated December 23; vide “Letter From Subhas Chandra Bose”, 23 12 1940 Mukundlal Sircar, with Gandhiji’s approval, released the correspondence to the Press.
('80', 3, 0, 1, 3983) 4 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 3, 1, 2, 4023) But I quite agree with you that either of you is more than a match for the Maulana Saheb as far as popularity is concerned.
('80', 3, 1, 3, 4147) But a man has to put conscience before popularity.
('80', 3, 1, 4, 4198) I know that in Bengal it is difficult to function effectively without you two.
('80', 3, 1, 5, 4277) I know, too, that you can carry on even without the Congress.
('80', 3, 1, 6, 4339) But the Congress has to manage somehow under the severe handicap.
('80', 3, 1, 7, 4405) Suresh 1 wrote to me that Sarat was coming.
('80', 3, 1, 8, 4449) I have been waiting.
('80', 3, 1, 9, 4470) He can come any time he chooses, and so can you too.
('80', 3, 1, 10, 4523) You know, you will be well looked after here.
('80', 3, 1, 11, 4569) As for your Bloc 2 joining civil disobedience, I think, with the fundamental differences between you and me, it is not possible.
('80', 3, 1, 12, 4698) Till one of us is converted to the other’s view, we must sail in different boats, though their destination may appear, only appear, to be the same.
('80', 3, 1, 13, 4846) Meanwhile let us love one another, remaining members of the same family that we are.

('80', 3, 5, 19, 5096) If you are ignorant, you alone are not to blame.
('80', 3, 5, 20, 5145) I am equally to blame, am I not?
('80', 3, 5, 21, 5178) Has not the education of all you brothers remained incomplete?
('80', 3, 5, 22, 5241) I do not regret that.
('80', 3, 5, 23, 5263) I am aware of it.

('80', 3, 6, 26, 5451) not so much for the contents, as for the clarification of your views.
('80', 3, 6, 27, 5521) It is not merely my personal desire to offer hearty and sincere co operation, but it is the desire of many who stand with me.
('80', 3, 6, 28, 5647) For doing this, it is neither necessary nor desirable to surrender or abandon our political principles and connections.
('80', 3, 6, 29, 5767) In the previous struggle, many worked shoulder to shoulder with ardent Gandhi ites while differing from them on several important questions.
('80', 3, 6, 30, 5908) Why should not this happen again?
('80', 3, 6, 31, 5942) I beg of you to reconsider your decision.

('80', 4, 1, 3, 6116) But is not that true of the whole of India?
('80', 4, 1, 4, 6160) Critics say that I am destroying the country.
('80', 4, 1, 5, 6206) Pyarelal’s statement contains pure truth.
('80', 4, 1, 6, 6248) It was not drafted to prove anything.
('80', 4, 1, 7, 6286) The letter 1 to Hitler also was prompted from within.
('80', 4, 1, 8, 6340) There is no bitterness in it at all.
('80', 4, 1, 9, 6377) But it certainly states what I believe to be truth.
('80', 4, 1, 10, 6429) Your scepticism in this regard does not pain me.
('80', 4, 1, 11, 6478) It is a virtue to see only the good in others.
('80', 4, 1, 12, 6525) But if we see the bad and still cover it up, isn’t that a vice?
('80', 4, 1, 13, 6589) Was it not I who used to sing ‘God Save the King’?
('80', 4, 1, 14, 6640) After much experience, I have come to see the darker side.
('80', 4, 1, 15, 6699) I have received the Government’s reply 2. I am sending you a copy of it.
('80', 4, 1, 16, 6772) It is poisonous.
('80', 4, 1, 17, 6789) I am in no hurry to see the letter to Hitler published.
('80', 4, 1, 18, 6845) It is enough for me that you are ready.
('80', 4, 1, 19, 6885) I will write to you when the time for you comes.
('80', 4, 1, 20, 6934) What you have said in the letter to Mahadev about your policy is correct.
('80', 4, 1, 21, 7008) There is no need for you to stand alone.
('80', 4, 1, 22, 7049) It is better to take a stand which others can share.
('80', 4, 1, 23, 7102) I cannot send Mahadev to take your place.
('80', 4, 1, 24, 7144) My suggestion was quite different.
('80', 4, 1, 25, 7179) But that also cannot be done now.
('80', 4, 1, 26, 7213) You may play whatever part you can.
('80', 4, 1, 27, 7249) This is but the beginning of the country’s fight.
('80', 4, 1, 28, 7299) The worst is yet to come.
('80', 4, 1, 29, 7325) Let us see how long God keeps me.
('80', 4, 1, 30, 7359) God knows what work He wants from me.
('80', 4, 1, 31, 7397) I merely dance to His tune.

('80', 4, 5, 35, 7523) SEVAGRAM, WARDHA, December 30, 1940
('80', 4, 6, 36, 7559) DEAR MR. LAITHWAITE, I thank you for your letter 3 of 27th instant, received yesterday.
('80', 4, 6, 37, 7647) Your letter raises a fundamental question.
('80', 4, 6, 38, 7690) I can fully appreciate the fact that His Excellency could only hold the view he does.
('80', 4, 7, 39, 7776) 1 Vide “Letter to Adolf Hitler”, 24 10 1940 2 Vide footnote 2, “Telegram to Sir J. G. Laithwaite; also the following item.

('80', 5, 0, 1, 7965) 6 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 5, 1, 2, 8005) despair of Indian nationalists like me has been that British functionaries could not be persuaded to see the other side of the shield.
('80', 5, 1, 3, 8140) And so the distance between them and nationalists is growing in spite of all efforts to the contrary.
('80', 5, 1, 4, 8242) The present struggle is the latest attempt among many to induce the makers of the British Empire to see things through nationalist eyes.
('80', 5, 1, 5, 8379) Such attempt must be continued till the truth is brought home to them.
('80', 5, 1, 6, 8450) Why should they constitute themselves the judges of their work among and on us?
('80', 5, 1, 7, 8530) The ordinary rule is that those should be the final judges who are the beneficiaries and not the self styled benefactors.But I must not enter into the interminable discussion of a question on which the British rulers and we must for the present differ.
('80', 5, 1, 8, 8783) But that difference can be no reason for gagging me.
('80', 5, 1, 9, 8836) I sought for the assistance because all the means of communication are under the Government control.
('80', 5, 1, 10, 8937) I was unprepared for the prohibition against the Indian Press.
('80', 5, 1, 11, 9000) I was prepared for the gag outside.
('80', 5, 1, 12, 9036) His Excellency must be the sole judge of the effect on the bona fide war effort of my letter to Herr Hitler being published in the world in the manner I had intended.
('80', 5, 1, 13, 9203) But I observe from your letter that the gag has been placed not for reasons of high policy but because, in His Excellency’s opinion, my characterization of British rule is not true to facts.
('80', 5, 1, 14, 9394) This is a dangerous doctrine of which the logical result would be suppression of all honest opinion except at the will of the executive head of the State or his deputy or deputies.
('80', 5, 1, 15, 9575) This has evidently no bearing on the war issue.
('80', 5, 1, 16, 9623) I may draw His Excellency’s attention to the fact that the sentiments expressed by me in the open letter to Herr Hitler are those I have expressed often enough in the columns of Harijan and elsewhere.
('80', 5, 1, 17, 9824) My booklet called Hind Swaraj 1 or Indian Home Rule contains similar sentiments.
('80', 5, 1, 18, 9905) I should like to know, if I may, whether my interpretation of your letter is correct.
('80', 5, 1, 19, 9991) I may mention that I had copies of the letter prepared for distribution to the Press.
('80', 5, 1, 20, 10077) But owing to the Press Adviser’s note I refrained from distributing the copies.
('80', 5, 1, 21, 10157) I have sent a copy only to my son forbidding its publication for the time being.
('80', 5, 1, 22, 10238) I do not want surreptitious publication, nor do I want to resort to open defiance, so

('80', 8, 3, 5, 12832) We do not want to give up everything modern.
('80', 8, 3, 6, 12877) The tape needs some improvement.
('80', 8, 3, 7, 12910) Assign the work to Bharatanandji 2 [for making] improvements in order to facilitate its use by the rural folk.
('80', 8, 3, 8, 13021) The rest will be done by Sushilabehn.
('80', 8, 3, 9, 13059) If it is possible it might perhaps be better to have all water boiled.
('80', 8, 3, 10, 13130) It is good to follow the rule to the extent possible.
('80', 8, 3, 11, 13184) According to the analysis of the experts the wells here remain polluted throughout the year.
('80', 8, 3, 12, 13277) That is another reason why there has been no case of typhoid ever since boiled water began to be used.

('80', 8, 7, 18, 13540) The booklet is all right but the absence of the table of contents is a great fault.
('80', 8, 7, 19, 13624) Let Ramnarayan look after the Hindi Navajivan and you join the Ajmer struggle.
('80', 8, 7, 20, 13703) I would like that arrangement.
('80', 8, 7, 21, 13734) You should not go till it becomes absolutely necessary.

('80', 10, 3, 4, 15679) MANILAL AND SUSHILA, I got your two quite lengthy letters together.
('80', 10, 3, 5, 15747) It is of course commendable that you two are holding out by yourselves.
('80', 10, 3, 6, 15819) He who is on the side of truth, though alone, is in company, and those who oppose truth, though millions in number, count for little.
('80', 10, 3, 7, 15953) Tari is with me for the last three days.
('80', 10, 3, 8, 15994) She is pretty ill.

('80', 10, 3, 18, 16412) It remains overcrowded.
('80', 10, 3, 19, 16436) Yesterday I called over Janakidevi here.

('80', 11, 7, 17, 17728) You must let me know the price.
('80', 11, 7, 18, 17760) If the fruit is dear, must get it from where it is cheap even when it is a gift.
('80', 11, 7, 19, 17841) I have three sick beds just now.
('80', 11, 7, 20, 17874) Your argument is both sound and unsound.
('80', 11, 7, 21, 17915) I would have the hospital in preference to superstition.
('80', 11, 7, 22, 17972) But there is a middle way—to have intelligent home treatment and then await the result with confidence.
('80', 11, 7, 23, 18076) Even kings have to die.
('80', 11, 7, 24, 18100) Thousands die in hospitals.
('80', 11, 7, 25, 18128) It is all a toss.
('80', 11, 7, 26, 18146) The key to life is in God’s hands.
('80', 11, 7, 27, 18181) We can but explore His laws and obey them.
('80', 11, 7, 28, 18224) And I do not expect a time when every villager who wishes can have good hospital treatment.
('80', 11, 7, 29, 18316) But I do expect a time when he can have at his door competent advice.
('80', 11, 7, 30, 18386) But even that time is far off.

('80', 12, 6, 18, 19893) Now Maulana is not coming.
('80', 12, 6, 19, 19920) I feel that now I should get out of the Sammelan.
('80', 12, 6, 20, 19970) A policy which I got accepted has been practically destroyed in Poona.
('80', 12, 6, 21, 20041) The Sammelan had full powers to change it.

('80', 13, 6, 22, 21293) To one who loves a quiet life, the type of motley crowd we have here can be unbearable.

('80', 15, 5, 8, 23331) SEVAGRAM, January 10, 1941
('80', 15, 6, 9, 23358) A very serious question confronts me in connection with the struggle.
('80', 15, 6, 10, 23428) In many places magistrates; have been imposing heavy fines on civil resisters, in some cases without option of imprisonment.
('80', 15, 6, 11, 23553) Civil resisters must not and cannot complain of whatever penalty is imposed on them, and Government will always take advantage of weaknesses of human nature.
('80', 15, 6, 12, 23711) Hitherto I have advised that fines should not be voluntarily paid but that authorities must be left to collect fines by distraint.
('80', 15, 6, 13, 23842) The result during the last struggle was a great deal of heart burning and bitterness.
('80', 15, 6, 14, 23928) Those who bought movables or immovables for a song incurred popular ill will.
('80', 15, 6, 15, 24006) I hope that if Government wish to touch immovable property, they will not sell but confiscate it.
('80', 15, 6, 16, 24104) For, whenever the struggle ends, immovable property is bound to be restored to the original owners—the resisters.
('80', 15, 6, 17, 24218) The late Bombay Government knew how difficult it was for them to restore to the resisters the immovable properties that had changed hands.
('80', 15, 6, 18, 24357) I have, however, discovered what may be termed a flaw in the reasoning that I had applied to the infliction of fines.
('80', 15, 6, 19, 24475) I now feel that even as a resister courts imprisonment, he is expected to court any other form of punishment, i.e., fines.
('80', 15, 6, 20, 24598) Punishment courted has to be joyfully suffered.
('80', 15, 6, 21, 24646) Therefore when fines are imposed and the person fined is able to pay he must do so willingly.
('80', 15, 6, 22, 24740) The result may naturally be that such a person will be fined again and again.
('80', 15, 6, 23, 24818) If he persists in his resistance, he may have no property left.
('80', 15, 6, 24, 24882) This is nothing to be wondered at.
('80', 15, 6, 25, 24917) As a matter of fact it is the essence of civil disobedience that the resister becomes indifferent whether the authorities take away all his property or not.
('80', 15, 6, 26, 25074) Therefore all propertied persons who wish to join the struggle should do so well knowing that the whole of their property may be taken up by the Government.
('80', 15, 6, 27, 25231) This is a struggle which has no ending except in success.
('80', 15, 6, 28, 25289) Therefore those who may be
('80', 16, 0, 1, 25316) VOL. 80 : 28 DECEMBER, 1940 17 AUGUST, 1941 17
('80', 16, 1, 2, 25363) fined should pay cash if they have it.
('80', 16, 1, 3, 25402) If they have no cash and the Government attach their property, it should be open to their friends to buy the same.
('80', 16, 1, 4, 25517) This will be an effective check on the cupidity of those who would profit by exploiting others’ loss and there will be no bad blood.
('80', 16, 1, 5, 25650) One corrollary to this reasoning is that even as I had declared that every inch of immovable property sold or confiscated by the Government would have to be returned to the resisters, so will every rupee taken in fines have to be returned to them on the struggle ending.
('80', 16, 1, 6, 25921) It follows of course that those who pay the fines will have to offer civil disobedience till they are safely lodged in jail.
('80', 16, 1, 7, 26046) It follows also that those propertied persons who do not wish to run the risk of losing their property must not join this struggle.
('80', 16, 1, 8, 26178) I hope however that patriotic people who believe in the efficacy of civil resistance will not fight shy of losing all their possessions.
('80', 16, 1, 9, 26315) Let them remember the words of Sheth Jamnalal:
('80', 16, 2, 10, 26362) I have long since come to realize that much too heavy a price has been and is being paid by the few for the enjoyment of wealth and for the apparent safety of life.
('80', 16, 2, 11, 26527) The price paid is the blood of the famishing millions and the manliness of those who should be ready to shed their blood for the defence of themselves, their families and their country.

('80', 17, 3, 4, 27335) Surely there is no cause for depression.
('80', 17, 3, 5, 27376) I have never condemned Punjab Congressmen.
('80', 17, 3, 6, 27419) I have faith that the average Congressman in the Punjab is as good as the average in the other provinces.
('80', 17, 3, 7, 27525) Let the Punjab Congressmen take heart and qualify themselves by spinning, and regarding Harijans and other Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, etc., as blood brothers.
('80', 17, 3, 8, 27681) Let them have a living faith in the virtue of non violence, and they will all be chosen for civil disobedience.

('80', 17, 7, 11, 27881) January 11, 1941
('80', 17, 8, 12, 27898) I hope that every man and woman in India, whether Congressman or other, will realize the gravity of the struggle and will resolve on the forthcoming Independence Day upon dedicating himself or herself to the service of the country in terms of the millions.
('80', 17, 8, 13, 28155) Swaraj based on non violence does not mean mere transfer of power.
('80', 17, 8, 14, 28222) It should mean complete deliverance of the toiling yet starving millions from the dreadful evil of economic serfdom.
('80', 17, 8, 15, 28339) This can only be attained by the propertied few identifying themselves with the millions and by their readiness to sacrifice their all for the latter’s sake.
('80', 17, 8, 16, 28497) It must be a day of fraternization, abolition of untouchability from our hearts, giving up spirituous liquors, self spinning, and sale and spread of khadi and village industries.
('80', 17, 8, 17, 28676) There is to be no civil disobedience that day.
('80', 17, 8, 18, 28723) For, we must not invite disturbance of our
('80', 17, 9, 19, 28766) 1 The message was sent through Jagannath who, in his letter dated January 10, requested: “A friend from Lahore who is a responsible and well informed Congress worker and who is in constant touch with Congressmen all over the Punjab writes to me that the recent occurrences in the Punjab have depressed the hearts of Congressmen there and have created confusion in their minds and they are feeling that they may have fallen in your estimation and you may have despaired of them.
('80', 17, 9, 20, 29244) A word from you will cheer them up.

('80', 18, 1, 2, 29364) meetings, processions and prabhat pheries 1 on that day.
('80', 18, 1, 3, 29421) The day may begin with prabhat pheries, followed by flag hoisting and flag salutation.
('80', 18, 1, 4, 29508) In the evening there may be processions terminating in public meetings where the pledge 2 may be explained clause by clause and administered by the Chairman and solemnly accepted by the audience.
('80', 18, 1, 5, 29704) Where there are already restrictions they must be obeyed.
('80', 18, 1, 6, 29762) From such voluntary obedience comes the strength for the right of civil resistance.
('80', 18, 2, 7, 29846) PLEDGE 3
('80', 18, 3, 8, 29855) In view of the fact that individual civil disobedience has already commenced and that a large number of Congressmen have already been imprisoned all over India, it becomes the special duty of every Indian to concentrate with redoubled zeal on the constructive programme, without the fulfilment of which no civil disobedience, mass or individual, can help us to win and retain swaraj.
('80', 18, 3, 9, 30239) Concretely expressed, constructive programme means the universalization of hand spinning and khadi and popularization of village industries and village products.
('80', 18, 3, 10, 30401) We recognize that effective spread of non violence must bring communal harmony and complete eradication of untouchability in every shape and form.

('80', 18, 6, 16, 30665) SEVAGRAM, WARDHA, January 11, 1941
('80', 18, 7, 17, 30700) MY DEAR IDIOT, Your wire has come in.
('80', 18, 7, 18, 30738) I had fully intended to write yesterday.
('80', 18, 7, 19, 30779) But it was no use.
('80', 18, 7, 20, 30798) The interviews which began at 3 p.m.
('80', 18, 7, 21, 30835) ended after the second dinner bell.
('80', 18, 7, 22, 30871) So you were crowded out.

('80', 19, 1, 3, 31334) That must have been some consolation.
('80', 19, 1, 4, 31372) I hope you are having a profitable time there 1. You will insist on seeing Ambujam and on going to the Hindi Prachar Office.
('80', 19, 1, 5, 31497) Ascertain the prices of the fruit you bring.
('80', 19, 1, 6, 31542) You will bring coconut of course.
('80', 19, 1, 7, 31576) But bring lemons (sour) too.
('80', 19, 1, 8, 31605) They are scarce in the Wardha market.
('80', 19, 1, 9, 31643) Das’s experiment is spreading.
('80', 19, 1, 10, 31674) I have joined it with greater zeal than when you were here.
('80', 19, 1, 11, 31734) I have given up cooked vegetables and the blood pressure has dropped in a phenomenal manner.
('80', 19, 1, 12, 31827) All the three times near or under 150 systolic and 100 diastolic.
('80', 19, 1, 13, 31893) The reason is absence of gases.
('80', 19, 1, 14, 31925) The note 2 I was drafting was finished today.

('80', 19, 5, 21, 32169) SEVAGRAM, WARDHA, January 12, 1941
('80', 19, 6, 22, 32204) Long before his unexpected arrest 3 Maulana Saheb had announced that before offering civil disobedience he would visit Sevagram and discuss with me important matters affecting the communal questions as also such other matters.
('80', 19, 6, 23, 32431) But it was not to be.
('80', 19, 6, 24, 32453) Non popular rulers do not disclose their intentions to the people.
('80', 19, 6, 25, 32520) They allow them to be inferred from their acts.
('80', 19, 6, 26, 32568) Perhaps it is a legitimate inference to draw from Maulana Saheb’s premature (from the Congress standpoint) arrest that they did not want him to meet me.
('80', 19, 6, 27, 32721) There can be no cause for complaint in this.
('80', 19, 6, 28, 32766) They may not be expected to consult Congress convenience.
('80', 19, 6, 29, 32824) But it is proper for Congressmen to realize that the rulers have no faith in Congress non violence.
('80', 19, 6, 30, 32924) Probably they do not consider me to be a knave, but they do consider me to be a fool.
('80', 19, 6, 31, 33010) In so doing they only follow many others who think that Congressmen fool me and that the latter’s

('80', 20, 1, 2, 33209) non violence is but a cloak for hiding their violence, if it is not a preparation for it.
('80', 20, 1, 3, 33299) Our struggle, therefore, consists in showing that our non violence is neither a cloak to hide our violence or hatred, nor a preparation for violence in the near or distant future.
('80', 20, 1, 4, 33479) Therefore our success depends not upon numbers going to jail but on the sum total of the purity and non violence we are able to show in all our activities.
('80', 20, 1, 5, 33635) Numbers can count only when they are of the right type.
('80', 20, 1, 6, 33691) They will positively harm the movement, if they are of the wrong type.
('80', 20, 1, 7, 33762) For me there is no turning back, whether I have many or very few satyagrahis.
('80', 20, 1, 8, 33840) I would far rather be regarded as a fool but strong, than as a knave and a coward.
('80', 20, 1, 9, 33923) Though the whole world may repudiate my claim, I must repeat that the struggle is God guided.
('80', 20, 1, 10, 34017) I am but a humble instrument in His hand.
('80', 20, 1, 11, 34059) Without His guidance, real or imaginary, I should feel utterly impotent to shoulder the burden I am supposed to be carrying.
('80', 20, 1, 12, 34184) Let me now say how I visualize the struggle.
('80', 20, 1, 13, 34229) Maulana Saheb having gone, there is to be no successor appointed.
('80', 20, 1, 14, 34295) Every acting President in a province must be approved by me.
('80', 20, 1, 15, 34356) It is not necessary that there should be one.
('80', 20, 1, 16, 34402) All representative Congressmen from members of village to provincial Committees are expected to be in jail if they are fit and approved by me.
('80', 20, 1, 17, 34545) If they are not, by reason of health or otherwise, they cannot be expected to function except in rare cases and that too under my approval.
('80', 20, 1, 18, 34685) No fresh elections are to take place to replace those who will have gone.
('80', 20, 1, 19, 34759) The idea is ultimately for every Congressman to act on his own and be his own president but nobody else’s.
('80', 20, 1, 20, 34866) That is the conception of a completely non violent institution or society.
('80', 20, 1, 21, 34941) Not much direction is required by those who have learnt the art of suffering.
('80', 20, 1, 22, 35019) Everybody knows the conditions he has to fulfil for acquiring fitness for offering civil disobedience.
('80', 20, 1, 23, 35122) They can be easily complied with by any adult who is sound in body and mind.
('80', 20, 1, 24, 35199) No difficulty as to action arises so long as I am left free.
('80', 20, 1, 25, 35260) For nobody can resort to direct action without my consent.
('80', 20, 1, 26, 35319) My intention not to court arrest abides, but the rulers may have a different plan.
('80', 20, 1, 27, 35402) If it comes, it will be the real time of freedom from external control be it ever so non violent as also of true test for everyone.
('80', 20, 1, 28, 35534) I am not to appoint a successor.
('80', 20, 1, 29, 35567) Thus if I am arrested, everyone will be under the discipline of his or her own conscience.
('80', 20, 1, 30, 35658) In theory, therefore, a time may come when millions will be judges of their own fitness to offer civil disobedience.
('80', 21, 0, 1, 35775) 22 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 21, 1, 2, 35816) This is not a struggle which can be ended quickly.
('80', 21, 1, 3, 35867) We are resisting an authority that is in itself struggling to fight for life against a stubborn foe.
('80', 21, 1, 4, 35968) The authority is related to a nation which knows no defeat.
('80', 21, 1, 5, 36028) Those whose life is in danger either readily yield on what they regard as non essential, or fight to the end on what they regard as essential.
('80', 21, 1, 6, 36171) Its refusal to concede our demand shows that they think that our struggle comes under the latter category.
('80', 21, 1, 7, 36278) Therefore our struggle must be coterminous at least with the European.
('80', 21, 1, 8, 36349) Hence everyone who offers civil disobedience and gets a short term should know that on every release he has to repeat civil disobedience till the end of the struggle.
('80', 21, 1, 9, 36516) There are two tactics demanding attention.
('80', 21, 1, 10, 36559) I have already issued a note 1 about fines without the option of imprisonment.
('80', 21, 1, 11, 36638) The other is that of not arresting civil resisters at all.
('80', 21, 1, 12, 36697) In each case the resisters should march on foot in easy stages in the direction of Delhi.
('80', 21, 1, 13, 36787) It may be even two or three miles per day.
('80', 21, 1, 14, 36830) The resister will march taking such food as the villagers may provide.

('80', 23, 7, 15, 40612) 30, explains that a statement, signed by prominent Indian Liberals, the signatories to which included V. N. Chandavarkar, P. S. Sivaswamy Aiyar and V. S. Srinivasa Sastri, was sent in reply to the letter on January 17, 1941. They held that “the British Government had so far failed to unify British and Indian interests and to inspire zeal for the British cause among the people of India.” The signatories, however, hoped that the situation “could be improved beyond recognition if the British acted with vision and courage.” 7 Vide also “Letter to Carl Heath”, 25 1 1941.

('80', 25, 2, 3, 42861) SEVAGRAM, WARDHA, January 16, 1941
('80', 25, 3, 4, 42896) DEAR SIR GILBERT,
('80', 25, 4, 5, 42914) Many thanks for your letter 1 of the 4th instant.
('80', 25, 4, 6, 42964) I am not going to write a serious reply to your extra serious letter.
('80', 25, 4, 7, 43034) My letters are not written either for publication or for propaganda, They are written in pursuance of the effort to act non violently.
('80', 25, 4, 8, 43169) Nor are they written to a stranger.
('80', 25, 4, 9, 43205) So much by way of preface.
('80', 25, 4, 10, 43232) The language of officialdom is evidently a thing to be learnt specially.
('80', 25, 4, 11, 43305) Your letter is an instance in point.
('80', 25, 4, 12, 43342) In my own plain English I resolve your language thus: I forgot to tell you that His Excellency’s disagreement with you as to the estimate of the British connection was not the only reason for not complying with your request.
('80', 25, 4, 13, 43567) It is inconvenient to give you the real or the whole reason.
('80', 25, 4, 14, 43628) So please regard this correspondence as closed.
('80', 25, 4, 15, 43676) Putting this interpretation upon your letter and reading it together with the last paragraph in it, I have finally decided not to contrive to secure publicity of the open letter 2 to Herr Hitler.
('80', 25, 4, 16, 43872) I have accordingly asked my son not to make any use of the letter but to destroy it.
('80', 25, 4, 17, 43957) I had told 3 you that I had not shown the letter to anyone else except my son.
('80', 25, 4, 18, 44036) I have since shown it to an English friend 4 who believes in my method.
('80', 25, 4, 19, 44108) She is not to make use of her knowledge except among friends such as the Bishop of Calcutta.
('80', 25, 4, 20, 44201) My hearty co operation with His Excellency in preventing publication does not mean admission of the validity of the prohibition It is an earnest of my desire not to embarrass authority wherever it is possible for me to avoid embarrassment.

('80', 26, 1, 2, 44659) But the action of the Censor in prohibiting the enclosed 1 passes comprehension.
('80', 26, 1, 3, 44740) I entertain the fond hope that His Excellency knows nothing of the Censor’s action.
('80', 26, 1, 4, 44824) I would like you very kindly to let me know whether it commands His Excellency’s approval.
('80', 26, 1, 5, 44915) If it does and if I am to fall in with it, it will stop all open communication with the public.
('80', 26, 1, 6, 45011) That would constitute an undue interference with the liberty of the Press, and would raise a grave issue.
('80', 26, 1, 7, 45117) I shall hope that if it is at all possible, this will be avoided.
('80', 26, 1, 8, 45183) As the matter is very urgent may I expect an early reply?

('80', 27, 1, 3, 46481) And now one never knows what one may write.
('80', 27, 1, 4, 46525) I do not mind the Censor reading what I write but I do mind his suppressing what one writes.
('80', 27, 1, 5, 46618) And yet war is war.
('80', 27, 1, 6, 46638) One must not grumble.
('80', 27, 1, 7, 46660) Warriors want to win and they will not tolerate what in their opinion hinders their efforts.
('80', 27, 1, 8, 46753) Knowing this, I am patient.
('80', 27, 1, 9, 46781) I do not know what you can do.
('80', 27, 1, 10, 46812) Here I am hampered at every step.
('80', 27, 1, 11, 46846) I wrote what I thought was a good letter 1 to Herr Hitler.
('80', 27, 1, 12, 46905) It has been suppressed.
('80', 27, 1, 13, 46929) Of course I could secure publication at once.
('80', 27, 1, 14, 46975) But I do not want to do so.
('80', 27, 1, 15, 47003) I must bow to the Viceregal judgment.
('80', 27, 1, 16, 47041) Evidently, he thinks it will interfere with their war effort.
('80', 27, 1, 17, 47103) Since open publication is possible only by their permission, I have deemed it proper not to seek publicity through defiance which must be initiated surreptitiously.
('80', 27, 1, 18, 47268) But they have gone a step further.
('80', 27, 1, 19, 47303) They are interfering with local publication of my statements which are necessary.
('80', 27, 1, 20, 47385) I am, therefore, devising a method of securing publication.
('80', 27, 1, 21, 47445) But no matter what hindrances are put, the struggle will continue.
('80', 27, 1, 22, 47512) I can give you this assurance, if you need it, that nothing unworthy, nothing that may be even remotely called violent will be knowingly done.
('80', 27, 1, 23, 47655) I have absolute faith that this non violence will finally triumph.
('80', 27, 1, 24, 47722) It must not be allowed to be suppressed.
('80', 27, 1, 25, 47763) The M.P.s’ appeal has fallen flat.
('80', 27, 1, 26, 47798) 2 It takes no note of the truth.
('80', 27, 1, 27, 47831) Hindu Muslim differences do not stand in the way of an honourable agreement.
('80', 27, 1, 28, 47908) The will is not there.

('80', 27, 1, 30, 47965) They need not be blamed.
('80', 27, 1, 31, 47990) They go on and, if they can, they do not stop to consider whether it is right or wrong.
('80', 27, 1, 32, 48078) That is not rulers’ way.

('80', 30, 7, 14, 51764) Letters are meaningless when hearts can speak to each other.
('80', 30, 7, 15, 51825) I know you are doing your duty there 4
('80', 30, 8, 16, 51864) as we are trying to do ours outside.
('80', 30, 8, 17, 51901) Do keep yourself well and complete your Hindi learning.

('80', 30, 13, 22, 52166) He has joined the ninth class and needs some books.
('80', 30, 13, 23, 52218) Please send for him and ask what books he wants and what they would cost.
('80', 30, 13, 24, 52292) He is a ‘free’ student.
('80', 30, 13, 25, 52316) His address is: 4/1 Sham Charande Street.

('80', 31, 5, 7, 52852) [Before January 23, 1941] 2
('80', 31, 6, 8, 52880) Non violence is an active force.
('80', 31, 6, 9, 52913) Do you not realize that when non violence reigns, materialism takes the back seat, avenues are changed; and in a non violent war there is no waste of efforts, property or the moral fibre?

('80', 31, 10, 13, 53201) The action of the Principal, if it is such as you describe, calls certainly for a protest.
('80', 31, 10, 14, 53292) You should negotiate with him respectfully; you should seek the assistance of leading citizens and you should cultivate public opinion.
('80', 31, 10, 15, 53428) Still if you do not obtain justice you have the right to strike.
('80', 31, 10, 16, 53493) To exercise that right or not is dependent upon the strength of the students.

('80', 32, 3, 4, 54011) VIJAYA, I got your letter.
('80', 32, 3, 5, 54038) My reason does not tell me that the gifts we make in the name of the dead benefit the dead.
('80', 32, 3, 6, 54130) But thereby we show our loyalty towards them.
('80', 32, 3, 7, 54176) I hold the same view about prayer.
('80', 32, 3, 8, 54211) But in such matters it is better to rely on faith rather than on reason.
('80', 32, 3, 9, 54284) At least there is no harm in doing so.
('80', 32, 3, 10, 54323) Charity must be prompted by knowledge.
('80', 32, 3, 11, 54362) I do not feel particularly tired.
('80', 32, 3, 12, 54396) Whatever fatigue I feel should now be accepted as inevitable in old age.
('80', 32, 3, 13, 54469) There is a good deal of illness here.

('80', 32, 7, 18, 54733) SEVAGRAM, January 24, 1941
('80', 32, 8, 19, 54760) I observe that in the Punjab people pay for and wear paper [or] metallic tricolour badges.
('80', 32, 8, 20, 54851) Now the tricolour has merit because of the material, that is, khadi, of which it is made and is a symbol of identification with the masses and of non violence.
('80', 32, 8, 21, 55011) Therefore badges must be made of khadi.
('80', 32, 8, 22, 55051) Metal and paper badges have no value for Congressmen save as superfluous decorations.
('80', 32, 8, 23, 55137) At this time of trial for us all I would expect Congressmen and those who are in sympathy

('80', 33, 11, 18, 56051) DEAR FRIEND, I have your very kind letter.
('80', 33, 11, 19, 56094) In it there is no acknowledgement of my cable reply 1 to your cable referred to in your letter.
('80', 33, 11, 20, 56190) My reply cabled 28th 2 October, 1940, was as follows:
('80', 33, 12, 21, 56244) All effort failed.
('80', 33, 12, 22, 56263) Indian condition wholly different and unique.
('80', 33, 12, 23, 56309) Press gagged.
('80', 33, 12, 24, 56323) Have stopped Harijan weeklies.
('80', 33, 12, 25, 56354) Restricting civil disobedience minimum requirements of non violence.
('80', 33, 12, 26, 56423) Since then I have sent you the following cable 3 in reply to yours of the last week of December:
('80', 33, 13, 27, 56520) 1 Vide “Cable to Carl Health”, 28 10 1940 and 15 1 1941. 2 The source, however, has “27”.
('80', 34, 0, 1, 56610) VOL. 80 : 28 DECEMBER, 1940 17 AUGUST, 1941 35
('80', 34, 1, 2, 56657) M.P.’s letter ignores facts.
('80', 34, 1, 3, 56686) Frank open communication made impossible.
('80', 34, 1, 4, 56728) God between us all.
('80', 34, 1, 5, 56748) I understand your argument.
('80', 34, 1, 6, 56776) The Quaker attitude is individual.
('80', 34, 1, 7, 56811) The Congress attitude has reference to a big organization.
('80', 34, 1, 8, 56870) The Congress, as an institution based on non violence, cannot distinguish between one species of violence and another.
('80', 34, 1, 9, 56989) I do not think that the world will be any better if British arms are victorious over the German through the means employed by the latter.
('80', 34, 1, 10, 57127) In the ultimate, the question before the Congress is how to do away with the use of arms as between man and man or nation and nation for the vindication of justice.
('80', 34, 1, 11, 57292) The universal proposition is implicit in India’s fight for freedom through non violence.
('80', 34, 1, 12, 57381) You have rightly detected the flaw in the Congress attitude as reflected in the Poona resolution.
('80', 34, 1, 13, 57479) That was when and why I had ceased to guide the Congress or take part in its deliberations.
('80', 34, 1, 14, 57571) I withdrew my opposition when the Congress retraced its steps through the later resolution at Bombay.
('80', 34, 1, 15, 57673) In my opinion it reflects no discredit on the Congress that it could not abide by non violence in all circumstances.
('80', 34, 1, 16, 57790) Its policy is truth and non violence.
('80', 34, 1, 17, 57828) Above all else, therefore, it must be honest.
('80', 34, 1, 18, 57874) When, therefore, it found the Poona demand flouted, it came round to its original position and invited me to lead the battle of civil disobedience.
('80', 34, 1, 19, 58022) I had no hesitation in responding as I knew that the mass mind in India was by instinct non violent.
('80', 34, 1, 20, 58123) You seem also to have missed the fact that the Poona resolution would not have been passed at all but for my weakness of which I made ample confession 1 in the pages of Harijan.
('80', 34, 1, 21, 58301) My experience is that the Congress has grown progressively, though slowly, in non violence.
('80', 34, 1, 22, 58393) And I would have proved an unworthy exponent of non violence if I had failed at the right moment to express it through the Congress.
('80', 34, 1, 23, 58526) The Congress is as much anti Nazism as anti imperialism.
('80', 34, 1, 24, 58583) If the Government had not thoughtlessly forbidden the anti war activity of the Congress and had not proclaimed it as pro Nazi, they could easily have claimed the whole of India as anti Nazi—both that part which followed the Congress non violence and the other which believed in the use of violence.
('80', 34, 1, 25, 58882) Had it not done so, much bitterness would have

('80', 35, 1, 3, 59220) It is never too late to mend one’s error.
('80', 35, 1, 4, 59262) Whether, however, the error is admitted and mended or not the course of the Congress is clear.
('80', 35, 1, 5, 59357) The conviction being purely moral it should be pursued irrespective of the immediate result.
('80', 35, 1, 6, 59450) A moral means is almost an end in itself.
('80', 35, 1, 7, 59492) Is not virtue its own reward?

('80', 35, 5, 11, 59664) SEVAGRAM, WARDHA, January 25, 1941
('80', 35, 6, 12, 59699) DEAR SIR TEJ BAHADUR, I have just finished reading your article 1 in the Twentiet Century.
('80', 35, 6, 13, 59790) I quite agree with you that we have to settle our domestic troubles ourselves and without thinking whether the rulers will accept our joint demands or not.
('80', 35, 6, 14, 59946) Having that belief you should know that I specially went 2 to Qaid e Azam Jinnah in Bombay and had several talks, and then Subhas Babu went but we could make no headway.
('80', 35, 6, 15, 60116) You perhaps know why.
('80', 35, 6, 16, 60138) Then again, determined not to go to the Viceroy as strangers, I invited myself to his house in Delhi 3 and from there we went together in his car but only to show our differences to the Viceroy.
('80', 35, 6, 17, 60333) I would go again and again if I had not the knowledge that my going would cause irritation to him.
('80', 35, 6, 18, 60432) I cannot crack a joke without exposing myself to being misunderstood.
('80', 35, 6, 19, 60502) My impression is that he does not want a settlement till he has so consolidated the League position that he can dictate his terms to all the parties concerned including the rulers.

('80', 36, 1, 3, 60875) But with this impression it is useless for me to approach him.

('80', 36, 1, 5, 61036) But if you have faith why don’t you see him without being asked by anybody?

('80', 36, 6, 13, 61448) Shri Natarajan I have known for years before he knew me.
('80', 36, 6, 14, 61505) I am a hero worshipper, and he was one of my heroes as a social reformer.
('80', 36, 6, 15, 61579) Then we began to know each other and became friends that we are today.
('80', 36, 6, 16, 61650) But I have never known him as a journalist.
('80', 36, 6, 17, 61694) He became an Editor because he was a reformer.
('80', 36, 6, 18, 61741) I do not believe in scholarship in journalism.
('80', 36, 6, 19, 61788) I would like Shri Natarajan’s name to be associated with a rise in the status of women or Harijan uplift or some such social reform dear to his heart.
('80', 36, 6, 20, 61939) But I have no desire to affect the course the Committee has adopted especially if it has met with Shri Natarajan’s approval.

('80', 37, 7, 13, 63004) [Before January 26, 1941] 2
('80', 37, 8, 14, 63032) I am fighting the country’s struggle.
('80', 37, 8, 15, 63070) The country includes students as much as other parts of the body politic.
('80', 37, 8, 16, 63144) I have, however, a special claim upon the students and they upon me, for I regard myself still a student and also because, from the very commencement of my return to India, I have been in close touch with them and many of them have served the cause of satyagraha.
('80', 37, 8, 17, 63408) Therefore, even if the whole of the student world were to repudiate me for causes which in their very nature must be temporary, I am not going to be deterred from tendering my advice for fear of rejection.
('80', 37, 8, 18, 63614) Students cannot afford to have party politics.
('80', 37, 8, 19, 63661) They may hear all parties, as they read all sorts of books, but their business is to assimilate the truth of all and reject the
('80', 37, 9, 20, 63789) 1 The addressee, in a letter to Gandhiji, said that “he would still maintain that the policy of the Students’ Federation was that all their actions for the achievement of the rights and redress of their grievances should be peaceful.
('80', 37, 9, 21, 64023) If the communists can prove otherwise, I am amenable to any disciplinary action.
('80', 37, 9, 22, 64104) We Congressmen, Socialists, Forward Bloc and others, except the communists, believe that the students’ platform should not be turned into a tail of any political party.
('80', 37, 9, 23, 64273) It must be kept aloof from party politics.” 2 From The Hindu, 27 1 1941, in which the letter was reported under the date line “Bombay, January 26”

('80', 38, 1, 2, 64467) balance.
('80', 38, 1, 3, 64476) This is the only worthy attitude that they can take.
('80', 38, 1, 4, 64529) Power politics should be unknown to the student world.
('80', 38, 1, 5, 64584) Immediately they dabble in that class of work they cease to be students and will, therefore, fail to serve the country in its crisis.
('80', 38, 1, 6, 64718) And you as General Secretary would be ill serving the cause of the students if you take part in power politics.
('80', 38, 1, 7, 64830) All communists are not bad as all Congressmen are not angels.
('80', 38, 1, 8, 64892) I have therefore no prejudice against communists as such.
('80', 38, 1, 9, 64950) Their philosophy, as they have declared it to me, I cannot subscribe to.
('80', 38, 1, 10, 65023) I have great regard for Dr. Ashraf’s abilities.
('80', 38, 1, 11, 65071) I have never questioned his love of his country but I am positive, he will one day be sorry for the wrong guidance he is giving to student world.
('80', 38, 1, 12, 65217) But, inasmuch as he is enamoured of his views, as I am of mine, and we are equally obstinate, I despair of convincing him of his error and, therefore, never enter into argument with him.

('80', 38, 1, 14, 65450) But let the students remember that at the present moment I am fighting the country’s cause.
('80', 38, 1, 15, 65542) I am not an inexperienced general, but a seasoned soldier of 50 years’ standing.
('80', 38, 1, 16, 65623) Let them, therefore, think 50 times before rejecting my advice which is that they must not dabble in strikes without reference to me.
('80', 38, 1, 17, 65757) I have never said or suggested that they may never resort to strikes.
('80', 38, 1, 18, 65827) They should not forget my recent advice 1 to the Christ Church College students.
('80', 38, 1, 19, 65908) I do not repent of that advice.
('80', 38, 1, 20, 65940) Let them take full benefit of it.
('80', 38, 1, 21, 65974) In the first place you gave me none 2 on behalf of the Federation.
('80', 38, 1, 22, 66041) In the second place, even if you had given any, I would not have taken it from you because you had no authority to give me assurance in advance.

('80', 42, 2, 3, 71427) SEVAGRAM, January 28, 1941
('80', 42, 3, 4, 71454) DEAR EDITOR, We have become so used to the Press gag that we hardly know that there is a partial paralysis of the Press.
('80', 42, 3, 5, 71575) In the name of “war effort” all honest expression of opinion, if it is opposed to war effort as conceived by the official world, is effectively suppressed, unless an enterprising editor or publisher risks the loss of his Press.
('80', 42, 3, 6, 71803) Thus my own effort, if my honesty be not questioned, is the true effort to end all war and therefore in no way anti British or pro German.
('80', 42, 3, 7, 71942) If public opinion desired suppression, the Press would on its own initiative exclude news and opinions disliked by the public.
('80', 42, 3, 8, 72069) But in India the majority of Indian Editors would gladly publish all the news about satyagraha if there was no gag.
('80', 42, 3, 9, 72185) I wish to use my case by way of illustration.
('80', 42, 3, 10, 72231) For the conduct of the campaign and for the sake even of keeping it within restraint, I have to issue statements from time to time.
('80', 42, 3, 11, 72363) During four days two out of three such statements were suppressed.
('80', 42, 3, 12, 72430) The reason assigned was as follows:
('80', 42, 4, 13, 72466) 1. January 16, 1941. I am writing this to inform you that Mahatma Gandhi’s statement of January 12 1 regarding continuance of the Civil Disobedience Movement was submitted for Press advice by two of the Press agencies but was not passed for publication.
('80', 42, 4, 14, 72720) I am accordingly bringing the above fact to your notice.
('80', 42, 5, 15, 72777) 2. January 28, 1941. I am writing this to inform you that Mahatma Gandhi’s statement of January 10 2 regarding payment of fines by satyagrahis, which was submitted for Press advice by two of the Press agencies, was not passed for publication, as being a prejudicial report containing incitement to carry on anti war civil disobedience.
('80', 42, 5, 16, 73113) I am accordingly bringing the above fact to your notice.
('80', 42, 6, 17, 73170) 1 Vide “Instructions to Satyagrahis”, 12 1 1941; the source, however, has “January 13”.
('80', 42, 6, 18, 73258) 2 Vide “Instructions to Satyagrahis”, 10 1 1941; the source, however, has “January 9”.
('80', 43, 0, 1, 73345) 44 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 43, 1, 2, 73386) I used to send my statements through the usual news agencies.
('80', 43, 1, 3, 73448) But when I found that they were censored, I had to send my statements to selected newspapers and so they found place in some of them.
('80', 43, 1, 4, 73582) You can judge for yourself whether they were objectionable news.
('80', 43, 1, 5, 73647) This method of sending statements on chance publication is precarious.
('80', 43, 1, 6, 73718) As I had no intention of extending civil disobedience to the special Press laws and ordinances, I stopped 1 the three Harijan weeklies whose chief aim was to propagate non violence and what is known as the constructive programme.
('80', 43, 1, 7, 73948) I do not want so far as possible to extend the scope of civil disobedience beyond the present limit.
('80', 43, 1, 8, 74049) But I do not know that I can exercise that restraint if the Press abdicates its function of publishing relevant news.
('80', 43, 1, 9, 74167) I therefore appeal to the Press not to succumb to the gag but to assert its independence by publish ing all the satyagraha news in its fullness.
('80', 43, 1, 10, 74312) Of course it is open to the Editors to criticize and condemn the movement or the statements that may be issued.
('80', 43, 1, 11, 74424) Editors can signify their disapproval of the gag by either publishing the offending statements and risking prose cution or even confiscation of the Press or by stopping publication of their papers altogether by way of protest.
('80', 43, 1, 12, 74651) These are only two out of many ways for signifying your disapproval.
('80', 43, 1, 13, 74720) I observe that the Standing Committee of Editors is meeting on the 1st proximo 2. The Committee is expected fearlessly to vindicate the liberty of the Press.
('80', 43, 1, 14, 74878) It must cease to be the power it should be, if it submits to suppression of free public opinion.
('80', 43, 1, 15, 74975) I need hardly draw attention to the fact that in a subject country like India, the liberty of the Press is doubly precious.
('80', 43, 1, 16, 75099) And your responsibility, if you represent British owned Press, is very great at the present critical moment in the history of this country.
('80', 43, 1, 17, 75239) I need hardly also draw attention to the fact that I represent unadulterated non violence whose spread can do nobody any harm.
('80', 43, 1, 18, 75366) It is false and cruel to suggest that I could have anything in common with Nazism or Fascism because I happen to oppose imperialism.

('80', 46, 6, 13, 78740) Rejection of so many nominations, on apparently the flimsiest grounds, is a serious matter.
('80', 46, 6, 14, 78832) It has filled me with deep regret that this injustice should have been perpetrated in Mysore.

('80', 47, 5, 9, 79897) I cannot do it.

('80', 47, 5, 11, 79985) But I know the result.
('80', 47, 5, 12, 80008) He will immediately distort our meeting.
('80', 47, 5, 13, 80049) He thinks that I am the greatest stumbling block.
('80', 47, 5, 14, 80099) I am, therefore, biding my time.
('80', 47, 5, 15, 80132) As soon as I see my way, I would certainly seek an interview with him and everybody else.
('80', 47, 5, 16, 80222) You may have seen how he has distorted the present civil disobedience as anti Muslim 2?
('80', 47, 5, 17, 80310) But of course you should pursue the subject after your own style with whomsoever you may think fit.

('80', 47, 8, 21, 81148) I have simply suggested to him that he should be prepared to meet you and to have a talk with you, if you should write to him to see him in Bombay or elsewhere..

('80', 48, 3, 5, 81475) I am afraid I won’t be able to help you.
('80', 48, 3, 6, 81516) I cannot lead a movement of satyagraha as you suggest.

('80', 48, 3, 11, 81771) They are entitled to hold the views they do.
('80', 48, 3, 12, 81816) But they cannot lead a satyagraha movement.
('80', 48, 3, 13, 81860) I think they will admit as much.
('80', 48, 3, 14, 81893) You draw too much upon our talks when you say that you would not have joined the Sabha without my blessings.
('80', 48, 3, 15, 82002) All I said was that you had every right to join it, if you thought the Congress was impotent and the Sabha could secure relief.

('80', 52, 9, 18, 87152) I shall write to him.
('80', 52, 9, 19, 87174) You say that all of you will come over in May.
('80', 52, 9, 20, 87221) Why so late?
('80', 52, 9, 21, 87234) It is very hot in May.
('80', 52, 9, 22, 87257) If you are not afraid of the heat, it is all right.
('80', 52, 9, 23, 87309) It will take time for your quarters to get ready.
('80', 52, 9, 24, 87359) But I shall be able to accommodate you in the quarters that are getting ready and make arrangements for a separate kitchen for you.
('80', 52, 9, 25, 87491) A suitable building for that will be ready soon.

('80', 52, 9, 29, 87691) Do observe the vow of brahmacharya which you have taken.
('80', 52, 9, 30, 87748) I would be happy if you could observe it.

('80', 53, 1, 3, 88011) But the practice cannot but do harm in the end.
('80', 53, 1, 4, 88059) It destroys morality.
('80', 53, 1, 5, 88081) According to me life without self control has no meaning.
('80', 53, 1, 6, 88139) Without self control no real service is possible.
('80', 53, 1, 7, 88189) Those who wish to observe brahmacharya should lead a simple and disciplined life.
('80', 53, 1, 8, 88271) They should keep themselves physically and mentally well occupied all the time.
('80', 53, 1, 9, 88351) One’s reading, too, should be such as will fill one’s mind with good thoughts.
('80', 53, 1, 10, 88430) Both husband and wife should devote themselves to public service, so that they might not even feel the desire for pleasure.
('80', 53, 1, 11, 88554) If you want to ask me anything more, do so.
('80', 53, 1, 12, 88598) You should, of course, do nothing beyond your capacity.
('80', 53, 1, 13, 88654) Only rare persons succeed in observing self control., If, therefore, you two cannot observe it for a long time, what need I say?
('80', 53, 1, 14, 88783) Hence both of you should think over the matter yourselves and do what you think best.
('80', 53, 1, 15, 88869) Devdas told me that Magan was thinking of going to Poona.
('80', 53, 1, 16, 88927) If you decide not to stay here, Poona would of course be better than Delhi.

('80', 54, 5, 9, 90058) Read the letter 1 to Balvantsinha.
('80', 54, 5, 10, 90093) What you write is absolutely correct.
('80', 54, 5, 11, 90131) Watch the result now.
('80', 54, 5, 12, 90153) The seemingly royal life is in fact a very simple one.
('80', 54, 5, 13, 90208) All this cannot be proved while the thing is still in an experimental stage.
('80', 54, 5, 14, 90285) But try to find out, if everybody eats all things raw with the exception of rotli, how much will the expenditure come to?
('80', 54, 5, 15, 90407) The quantity of milk would be reduced, less fuel would be consumed and, as for fruits, the fruits and vegetables grown in our gardens would be enough to meet our needs.
('80', 54, 5, 16, 90576) This is my reason for plunging into this experiment with the enthusiasm of a young man.
('80', 54, 5, 17, 90664) That we in the ashram are a motley crowd is of course a big handicap.

('80', 54, 8, 25, 91133) Didn’t I have a share in building up the school?

('80', 57, 7, 9, 94430) SEVAGRAM, WARDHA, February 10, 1941
('80', 57, 8, 10, 94466) SIR, Your word to me written so earnestly in your issue of February 7, demands a reply.
('80', 57, 8, 11, 94554) In spite of your disbelief, I must adhere to my faith in the possibility of the most debased human nature to respond to non violence.
('80', 57, 8, 12, 94688) It is the essence of non violence that it conquers all opposition.
('80', 57, 8, 13, 94755) That I may not express myself that measure of non violence, and the rest may express less is highly probable.
('80', 57, 8, 14, 94865) But I will not belittle the power of non violence or distrust the Fuhrer’s capacity to respond to true non violence.
('80', 57, 8, 15, 94982) The illustrations you have cited in support of your disbelief are all unhappy because wholly inapplicable.
('80', 57, 8, 16, 95089) A man is not necessarily non violent because he lays down his arms.
('80', 57, 8, 17, 95157) The Czechs, the Danes, the Austrians, and the Poles may have all acted most wisely, but certainly not non violently.
('80', 57, 8, 18, 95274) If they could have put up successful armed resistance, they would have done so and would have deserved well of their countrymen.
('80', 57, 8, 19, 95403) Nor is it for me to blame them for submission when resistance became vain.
('80', 57, 8, 20, 95478) It was, however, order to meet such contingen cies and in order to enable even the physically weakest persons not to feel powerless against physically strong persons fully armed with

('80', 58, 0, 1, 95837) VOL. 80 : 28 DECEMBER, 1940 17 AUGUST, 1941 59
('80', 58, 1, 2, 95884) modern weapons of destruction that satyagraha was discovered and applied in South Africa in 1907 1. And it has since been successfully applied under varying and even baffling circumstances.
('80', 58, 1, 3, 96074) You will please excuse me for refusing to draw a distinction in kind between the forces I have had to cope with hitherto and what I may have to cope with if the Fuhrer attacked India.
('80', 58, 1, 4, 96258) The prospect of his killing every satyagrahi causes neither terror nor despair.
('80', 58, 1, 5, 96338) If India has to go through such a purgatory and if a fair number of satyagrahis face the Fuhrer’s army and die without malice in their breasts, it would be a new experience for him.
('80', 58, 1, 6, 96520) Whether he responds or not, I am quite clear that these satyagrahis facing the army will go down in history as heroes and heroines at least equal to those of whom we learn in fables or cold history.
('80', 58, 2, 7, 96719) You are, however, on less weak ground when you doubt the honesty or non violence of my companions.
('80', 58, 2, 8, 96818) You are entitled to throw the Poona resolution in my face.
('80', 58, 2, 9, 96877) I have already confessed 2 that the Poona resolution would not have been passed but for my momentary weakness.
('80', 58, 2, 10, 96988) As to the want of honesty or defective non violence, I can only say that the future alone will show whether satyagrahis were only so called or as honest and true as human beings can be.
('80', 58, 2, 11, 97174) I can only assert that every care has been taken in making the selection to ensure a fair standard of non violence.
('80', 58, 2, 12, 97290) I admit, however, that hypocrites have undoubtedly crept in.
('80', 58, 2, 13, 97351) But I entertain the belief that the vast majority will be found to be true.
('80', 58, 2, 14, 97427) The Congress President has been frank enough to define the limitations of his non violence.
('80', 58, 2, 15, 97519) 3 But so far as I know his mind—and nobody does if I do not—his non violence will be proof against any temptation within the limits defined by him.
('80', 58, 2, 16, 97667) I should undertake to engage in non violent resistance to the Fuhrer if I had companions with the Maulana Saheb’s circumscribed belief.
('80', 58, 2, 17, 97803) Whether such non violence can stand the test or not, is a moot question.
('80', 58, 2, 18, 97876) I have achieved success till now with such material.
('80', 58, 2, 19, 97929) You are incorrect in attributing to me a demand for unfettered

('80', 59, 0, 1, 98402) 60 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 59, 1, 2, 98443) liberty of the Press or speech.
('80', 59, 1, 3, 98475) 1 What I have said 2 is that there should be unfettered liberty provided that it is not inconsistent with non violence.
('80', 59, 1, 4, 98595) I am not aware that Congress Ministers’ restrictive action went beyond the proviso.
('80', 59, 1, 5, 98679) If it did, it was certainly against the declared Congress policy and can be no guide or criterion for me.
('80', 59, 1, 6, 98785) The unkindest cut is contained in the insinuation that my demand for free speech, subject to the proviso mentioned, was “a device for squeezing political concessions from the British”.
('80', 59, 1, 7, 98970) There would be nothing politically wrong if political concessions were demanded even at the point of civil disobedience.
('80', 59, 1, 8, 99091) But it is a matter of public knowledge that the Poona resolution has lapsed.
('80', 59, 1, 9, 99168) And in so far as I am concerned, it remains lapsed so long as the war lasts.
('80', 59, 1, 10, 99245) Civil disobedience would certainly be withdrawn if free speech is genuinely recognized and the status quo restored.
('80', 59, 1, 11, 99361) I have never stated during previous movements that they were likely to be long drawn out.
('80', 59, 1, 12, 99451) But I have done so this time because I believe that there can be no settlement with the Congress, short of complete independence during the pendency of the war, for the simple reason that the Congress cannot commit itself to active help in war with men and money.
('80', 59, 1, 13, 99715) That would mean a reversal of the policy of non violence which the Congress has pursued for the last 20 years.
('80', 59, 1, 14, 99826) And independence cannot come through any settlement while the war lasts.
('80', 59, 1, 15, 99899) Therefore so far as I know, the Congress will be satisfied with the fullest freedom to grow in non violence.
('80', 59, 1, 16, 100008) The Congress demand concerns all persons and parties.
('80', 59, 1, 17, 100062) You ask me in the face of all these facts whether it is “fair or morally right to pursue his (my) present campaign”.
('80', 59, 1, 18, 100179) You have answered the question yourself in the negative.
('80', 59, 1, 19, 100236) But I may not accept your answer.
('80', 59, 1, 20, 100270) In the first place, as shown above, I do not subscribe to your facts.
('80', 59, 1, 21, 100340) Secondly, to accept your answer will be to declare my utter insolvency.
('80', 59, 1, 22, 100412) I would be untrue to the faith I have unwaveringly held now for nearly half a century in the efficacy of non violence.
('80', 59, 1, 23, 100531) I may seemingly fail, but even at the risk of being completely misunderstood I must live and act according to my faith and belief that I am serving
('80', 59, 2, 24, 100679) 1 The Times of India had argued: “He demands the unfettered liberty of the Press and the right of the individual to say what he likes.
('80', 59, 2, 25, 100814) These so called rights do not exist anywhere in the world; they did not prevail when Mr. Gandhi’s Congress Governments were in office in the Indian provinces.
('80', 59, 2, 26, 100973) Bombay and Madras bear witness to that fact.
('80', 59, 2, 27, 101018) Is Mr. Gandhi justified in demanding for himself and others a privilege which even Congress Ministers denied to the public?” 2 Vide “letter to Newspaper Editors”, 28 1 1941

('80', 60, 1, 2, 101238) India, Britain and humanity.
('80', 60, 1, 3, 101267) I do not wish well to India at the expense of Britain as I do not wish well to Britain at the expense of Germany.
('80', 60, 1, 4, 101381) Hitlers will come and go.
('80', 60, 1, 5, 101407) Those who believe that when the Fuhrer dies or is defeated his spirit will die, err grievously.
('80', 60, 1, 6, 101503) What matters is how we react to such a spirit, violently or non violently.
('80', 60, 1, 7, 101578) If we react violently, we feed that evil spirit.
('80', 60, 1, 8, 101627) If we act non violently, we sterilize it.
('80', 60, 1, 9, 101669) You ask me to devote myself to internal unity.
('80', 60, 1, 10, 101716) Well, my passion for it is as old as that for non violence.
('80', 60, 1, 11, 101776) Indeed, my first non violent experiment outside the domestic circle was to promote that unity.
('80', 60, 1, 12, 101871) And I had considerable success.
('80', 60, 1, 13, 101903) I ask you, therefore, to believe me that my effort for unity is not suspended but intensified by the present movement.
('80', 60, 1, 14, 102022) The great beauty of non violent effort lies in the fact that its failure can only harm those who are in it, while its success is sure to promote all round good.

('80', 62, 11, 20, 104617) When people are in need of blessings, they do not seek them by post.
('80', 62, 11, 21, 104686) So Mary will have to come here and ask them with due supplication.
('80', 62, 11, 22, 104753) As for your suit, it has failed in spite of my pleading.
('80', 62, 11, 23, 104810) My whole soul rebels against any speechifying.

('80', 67, 9, 21, 111367) There should be no competition between provinces for number.
('80', 67, 10, 22, 111428) It is understood that Mahatma Gandhi has disapproved of the proposal of the Berar Provincial Congress Committee to start training camps for satyagrahis.
('80', 67, 10, 23, 111581) Mahatma Gandhi is reported to have told Mr. Vamanrao Joshi, President of the Berar Provincial Gongress Committee, when he interviewed him recently, not to start such training camps as it might be banned by the Government and that he did not want to embarrass the Government.

('80', 69, 7, 17, 114668) BHAI ADVAITA KUMAR, Received your letter just now.
('80', 69, 7, 18, 114719) My opinion is that you should not pick a quarrel over congregational prayer.
('80', 69, 7, 19, 114796) It is a different thing if obstruction is put on individual prayer.
('80', 69, 7, 20, 114864) Prayer should not be said loudly even in one’s own room.

('80', 71, 7, 25, 117237) SEVAGRAM, February 16, 1941
('80', 71, 8, 26, 117265) DEAR MUKUNDALAL, I have your letter 2. I had to delay replying to you because I got your copy of Subhas Babu’s letter first and then his own letter.
('80', 71, 9, 27, 117414) 1 The Foreword did appear as facsimile block on all cover jackets of the titles under “Gandhi Series”.
('80', 71, 9, 28, 117517) To the Students and To the Women were the first two books published under the series on October 2, 1941. 2 According to the source, “the letter of Mr. Bose dated January 10 [vide footnote 4, “Letter to Jamnalal Bajaj”] having remained unanswered, Mr. Mukundalal Sircar sent a telegram to Mahatma Gandhi on January 28, asking for a reply.
('80', 71, 9, 29, 117855) When he learnt from Sevagram that Mahatma Gandhi did not receive the letter in question, Mr. Sircar sent a copy of the same on February 8 for ready reference.”
('80', 72, 0, 1, 118015) VOL. 80 : 28 DECEMBER, 1940 17 AUGUST, 1941 73
('80', 72, 1, 2, 118062) The differences in our case are vital and fundamental.
('80', 72, 1, 3, 118117) Subhas Babu knows them, and I expect you too know them.
('80', 72, 1, 4, 118173) Independence secured through violence would have contents different from that secured through non violent means.
('80', 72, 1, 5, 118286) My notion of independence is independence of the poorest and the lowliest in the land.
('80', 72, 1, 6, 118373) But in political language, all of us—Communists, Socialists, Kisan Sabhaites, Labourites and others must think of independence though all will have different meanings for the same word.
('80', 72, 1, 7, 118559) So far as I am concerned, I have no objection to the whole of the correspondence being published.
('80', 72, 1, 8, 118657) You will please let me know as soon as news about Subhas Babu’s whereabouts is known.

('80', 72, 5, 12, 118827) DEAR SIR TEJ BAHADUR, I thank you for two letters 2. I need not now discuss the points raised by you.
('80', 72, 5, 13, 118929) Qaid e Azam Jinnah’s letter confirms my fear.
('80', 72, 5, 14, 118975) He would see me if I go “on behalf of the Hindu community”.
('80', 72, 5, 15, 119035) This I cannot do.
('80', 72, 5, 16, 119053) I do not represent the Hindu community.
('80', 72, 5, 17, 119093) I am not even a member of the Hindu Mahasabha.
('80', 72, 5, 18, 119140) But you may not now get out of the situation.
('80', 72, 5, 19, 119186) You must not mind my warning 3. I suggest your writing to Qaid e Azam that his position is unsound, if you agree with me.
('80', 72, 6, 20, 119308) 1 The addressee’s reply dated February 21, inter alia, read: “Though I consider the correspondence on this subject as closed, I feel constrained to say that the sentence in your letter with particular reference to violent and non violent means, in my opinion, does not arise and is not relevant to the point of clarification sought for by Subhas Babu, because he is a Congressman and the Forward Blocists are Congressmen as well.
('80', 72, 6, 21, 119738) As such Subhas Babu and his associates in the Forward Bloc had all along advocated the means of “non violent” mass struggle as the only potential force to secure independence and, therefore, the independence thus secured is surely the independence through non violent means.” 2 Dated February 12 and 14.

('80', 75, 3, 4, 123094) In my opinion the Magistrate’s remarks 3are libellous.
('80', 75, 3, 5, 123149) There should be no appeal.

('80', 75, 3, 7, 123220) He cannot harm the movement.
('80', 75, 3, 8, 123249) He has harmed the Service he has disgraced.
('80', 75, 4, 9, 123293) The Hindu, 21 2 1941
('80', 75, 5, 10, 123314) 1 The addressee, a Congressman of Gudur, had drawn Gandhiji’s “attention to the remarks made by the local Sub Divisional Magistrate, Mr. R. Galletti, in his judgment in the cases against satyagrahis, and in his speech at the public meeting held in connection with the satyagraha offered by Enuga Narasa Reddi in Gudur, on February 1.” The report appeared under the date line “Gudur, February 17”.
('80', 75, 5, 11, 123711) 2 ibid 3 According to The History of the Indian National Congress, Vol. II, p.
('80', 75, 5, 12, 123790) 265, “Galletti was not merely stating from the bench that it was wrong on the part of the police to prosecute the smaller fry, leaving alone the prime movers who were the arch conspirators .
('80', 75, 5, 13, 123981) but by joining public meetings and arguing out with the people the pros and cons of the movement.” The book explains that in one of his speeches, referring to Narasa Reddi’s trial before him and Gandhiji’s instruction to him to spin for fifteen days, subsequent to discharge order and to offer satyagraha again, Mr. Galletti “disputed the assertion of Mr. Reddi about spinning, and added that he would honour men of character though they were misguided, and expose those to ridicule who lacked it.
('80', 75, 5, 14, 124479) Speaking on the war effort in his division, Mr. Galletti assured himself that the satyagrahis could not do anything ‘prejudicial’, even if Mr. Gandhi came and had his say.” Referring to the correspondence between Gandhiji and E. E. Mack (vide pp.
('80', 75, 5, 15, 124726) 315 and 329), Galletti is stated to have said that “ ‘Gandhiji, as everyone knew, would not go out of his spiritual determination.’ He quoted the analogy of Quakers who had conscientious objection to war but at the same time came forward to the relief of the victims in war.
('80', 75, 5, 16, 125001) The same was the view of Gandhiji.
('80', 75, 5, 17, 125036) But what was the Provincial Congress Committee doing?
('80', 75, 5, 18, 125090) There were a number of Congressmen who were angry with Gandhiji for his opinion on Congressmen’s participation in Red Cross work.
('80', 75, 5, 19, 125220) There were a few sincere Congressmen but most lacked honesty.
('80', 75, 5, 20, 125282) Many of them .
('80', 75, 5, 21, 125297) were inconsistent.”

('80', 77, 8, 13, 126990) If I myself break rules, who will observe them?
('80', 77, 8, 14, 127038) Hence behind my seeming breach of a rule you will discover that I really observe it.
('80', 77, 8, 15, 127123) If I had known about Kripalani, I would have stopped him.
('80', 77, 8, 16, 127181) Nevertheless it is our duty when a guest turns up unexpectedly that we should spare for him some food even from the measured quantity that has been cooked.
('80', 77, 8, 17, 127337) One should exercise one’s discretion.
('80', 77, 8, 18, 127375) The sparing of such food would be dharma only if it is willingly done by the person concerned.
('80', 77, 8, 19, 127470) Ba’s interference is of course to be regretted.
('80', 77, 8, 20, 127518) But that is part of her nature.
('80', 77, 8, 21, 127550) We have, therefore, no option but to put up with it.
('80', 77, 8, 22, 127603) Ba has changed herself a great deal with patience.
('80', 77, 8, 23, 127654) If I made more effort, she would improve still further.
('80', 77, 8, 24, 127710) But I save my time.
('80', 77, 8, 25, 127730) Yet I will see.
('80', 77, 8, 26, 127746) You must take charge of datan 3. Anybody who uses one must pick it with his eyes shut.
('80', 77, 8, 27, 127833) Nobody should select and choose.
('80', 77, 9, 28, 127866) 1 Gandhiji had written this on the margin of Abdus Samad Ansari’s letter to him complaining of corruption and anti Muslim prejudice on the part of Congress members in electing chairman to Sultanpur District Board.
('80', 77, 9, 29, 128080) 2 In his reply dated March 4, the addressee said that A.S. Ansari’s report was true; but he could not find any proof for the charges of corruption and the anti Muslim prejudice.

('80', 78, 1, 7, 128563) The matter should be discussed with all.
('80', 78, 1, 8, 128604) The use of 501 soap must be stopped.
('80', 78, 1, 9, 128641) Why shouldn’t we ourselves make soft soap?
('80', 78, 1, 10, 128684) See if you can do something about it.

('80', 78, 1, 13, 128843) There should be some arrangement for looking after it.
('80', 78, 1, 14, 128898) The persons in charge must be sthitaprajnas 1. If we have such persons, the whole set up would function smoothly.

('80', 78, 4, 21, 129293) [Before February 19, 1941] 2
('80', 78, 5, 22, 129322) It is understood that Mahatma Gandhi has sent a letter to Ali Gul Khan, President of the Frontier Congress Committee, expressing his agreement with Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s suggestion that satyagrahis should remain in the Frontier Province to finish constructive work and thus there need be no march towards Delhi for the present.
('80', 78, 6, 23, 129654) Referring to those satyagrahis who want to postpone satyagraha on some pretext or another, Mahatma Gandhi is understood to have advised that their names should be struck off the list unless their case is undeniable.
('80', 78, 7, 24, 129870) Ali Gul Khan is forwarding the letter to Abdul Ghaffar Khan who is at Utmanzai.

('80', 79, 5, 6, 130313) I showed your letter to the General Secretary dated the 16th February, 1941, to Gandhiji who has asked me to reply to you as follows:
('80', 79, 6, 7, 130447) He sees no objection whatsoever to Congressmen helping in the prohibition campaign started by the present Government, provided it does not affect the satyagraha campaign.
('80', 79, 6, 8, 130618) That is to say, those who have signed the satyagraha pledge and are due to offer satyagraha on the dates given to them may not allow their decision to be affected by the campaign.
('80', 79, 6, 9, 130798) You say: “Some Congressmen, mostly active satyagrahis, have been enrolled as members of prohibition committees and, in some cases, they have assumed responsible roles.” But Shri Chaliha in his letter to Gandhiji dated 15th February, 1941, writes: “Congressmen who are offering services for this work are almost (all?) non satyagrahis, and out of 150 members there are only a few satyagrahis.” What is the truth?
('80', 79, 6, 10, 131210) However, our duty is clear.
('80', 79, 6, 11, 131238) Those who have not signed the satyagraha pledge may offer full co operation to Government, and those who have, may do so until the date on which they are offering satyagraha.

('80', 82, 6, 12, 135101) The following seven chapters are a result of Pyarelal’s deep study of the status of the Princes of India.
('80', 82, 6, 13, 135207) They should have been published in pamphlet form long ago, and would have been, but for my pre occupation.
('80', 82, 6, 14, 135314) The writer is himself behind jail walls.
('80', 82, 6, 15, 135355) Therefore they are being published as they were written.
('80', 82, 6, 16, 135412) They are an evergreen.
('80', 82, 6, 17, 135435) They give to the busy public worker or student, in a compact form, an idea of the status of the Princes of whom there are nearly six hundred.
('80', 82, 6, 18, 135577) The chief merit of the pamphlet is that it contains nothing but what is taken from authentic records.
('80', 82, 6, 19, 135679) The existence of this gigantic autocracy is the greatest dis proof of British democracy and is a credit neither to the Princes nor to the unhappy people who have to live under this undiluted autocracy.
('80', 82, 6, 20, 135881) It is no credit to the Princes that they allow themselves powers which no human being, conscious of his dignity, should possess.
('80', 82, 6, 21, 136010) It is no credit to the people who have mutely suffered the loss of elementary human freedom.
('80', 82, 6, 22, 136103) And it is perhaps the greatest blot on British rule in India.
('80', 82, 6, 23, 136165) But we are too near the event to realize the falsity called “Princes’ India” or “Indian India”.
('80', 82, 6, 24, 136261) The system will break under its own intolerable weight.
('80', 82, 6, 25, 136317) My humble non violent effort is to induce all the three parties to wash the triple sin.
('80', 82, 6, 26, 136405) Even one of them can take the decisive step and it will affect all.
('80', 82, 6, 27, 136473) But it will be glorious if the three together realize the enormity of the sin and by a combined effort wash it.

('80', 83, 3, 4, 136773) It would not be wrong if non arrested satyagrahis tour the whole district for a month or two and then proceed to Delhi.
('80', 83, 3, 5, 136893) Some may tour in the district and some may go to Delhi.
('80', 83, 4, 6, 136949) Referring to illiterate Harijan satyagrahis, Mahatma Gandhi says that if they do not march to Delhi or return after going half way, they should do constructive work and may also learn reading and writing.
('80', 83, 5, 7, 137154) Mahatma Gandhi does not approve of the idea of batches of two, three or four satyagrahis proceeding to Delhi but wants everyone to go singly.
('80', 83, 6, 8, 137296) Answering another question, Mahatma Gandhi says that those not proceeding to Delhi should offer satyagraha in their provinces.
('80', 83, 7, 9, 137423) To another query, “When people are told not to give food to satyagrahis, what should they do?”, Mahatma Gandhi replied that they should buy food if they have money or starve or proceed further; no hard and fast rule can be laid down.

('80', 85, 11, 24, 140836) Gandhiji wrote down the reply so that she could carry it with her during her second term of imprisonment, and in order that the women prisoners would not doubt its authenticity.
('80', 85, 11, 25, 141014) Gandhiji left Sevagram on February 26.

('80', 86, 1, 7, 141576) The purpose behind payment of fine is only to remove the fear of fine as we have already overcome the fear of jail.
('80', 86, 1, 8, 141692) It does not mean that fine should be paid by borrowing money.
('80', 86, 1, 9, 141754) But we should not lose valuable things for a negligible price.

('80', 86, 4, 15, 142098) [Before February 27, 1941] 1
('80', 86, 5, 16, 142127) The Azad Arrangement 2 should be adhered to, failing which the Congress members of the Assembly should help in dethroning the present Ministry 3 and support Khan Bahadur Allah Baksh, in forming a new Ministry.
('80', 86, 6, 17, 142337) It is understood that Mahatma Gandhi had earlier expressed the opinion that in case the Azad Pact was broken, the Congress members should resign and come out of the Assembly, but on a reference being made to him whether he was still of the same opinion, Mahatma Gandhi expressed the above view, having learned in the meanwhile Maulana Azad’s mind in the matter.

('80', 87, 3, 4, 143201) Mahatma Gandhi, while expressing his delight at the completion of a great project 1 which was the fulfilment of the last wish of the late Mrs. Kamala Nehru, pointed out that the Kamala Nehru Hospital was one of the first of its kind from the point of view of architectural beauty, and the comforts provided for the patients might attract even maharanis.
('80', 87, 3, 5, 143555) He, however, hoped that those responsible for running the day to day administration of the institution would not forget that the hospital was primarily intended for the poor whose interests should not be neglected, and service to the poor patients should be the motto of those in charge of the administration.

('80', 88, 4, 13, 145264) March 1, 1941
('80', 88, 5, 14, 145278) The students cannot offer satyagraha unless they are ready to suspend their studies during the period of the Movement.
('80', 88, 6, 15, 145397) Mahatma Gandhi added that those who could not go to that length might do constructive work, specially the promotion of khadi and communal unity.
('80', 88, 6, 16, 145542) It was undesirable that communal virus should infect the brains of the students.
('80', 88, 7, 17, 145623) Gandhiji also emphasised the need for discipline, which was necessary in any organization.
('80', 88, 7, 18, 145714) Even violence, he remarked, needed discipline as was obvious from the example of Hitler.
('80', 88, 8, 19, 145803) Regarding the strikes, Gandhiji reiterated his previous statements 2 and warned the students against entering into party politics prematurely.
('80', 88, 8, 20, 145946) He urged that the students should keep an open mind and study ideologies.
('80', 88, 8, 21, 146020) He stressed that the students could play an important part in bringing about communal unity.

('80', 88, 9, 23, 146134) 1 About 19 members of the Working Committee of the Federation met Gandhiji at Anand Bhavan in the morning; Ram Naresh Shukla, Balram Srivastava, Siddiq Ahmad, Hit Narain Singh and Madan Mohan Prasad were among them.
('80', 88, 9, 24, 146350) The report said: “Mr. T. K. Chaturvedi, Convenor of the U.P. Students’ Federation of the rival group, submitted today to Mr. Mahadev Desai for Mahatma Gandhi a memorandum deploring the present ‘unfortunate split’ in the Students’ Federation, and repudiating the allegation that his group was opposed to the present national struggle and requesting Mahatma Gandhi to help them in bringing about unity amongst the students by blessing the plan of ‘democratic elections’ suggested in the memorandum.” 2Vide “Message to Students”, 14 11 1940, “Satement to the Press”, 29 11 1940 and “Fragment of Letter to M.

('80', 89, 11, 20, 148075) I gave my finding about the causes of the riot, and suggested the means of restoring communal harmony in that unfortunate province.
('80', 89, 11, 21, 148207) As regards the Manzilgah, my finding was that it was a mosque, that it was undesirable to have a tribunal, that it should be restored to the Muslims who on their part should take their Hindu brethren back to the villages and should inspire confidence in them....
('80', 89, 11, 22, 148470) No doubt, in my report I have criticized our own organization in Sind with a view to reform it and make it more acceptable to the people....
('80', 89, 11, 23, 148611) Now that the judicial enquiry is also over and the Manzilgah has been restored by the Government to the Muslims, there is absolutely no justification for not publishing my report any longer.

('80', 92, 3, 5, 151710) He added that this form of satyagraha would be resorted to from next week.
('80', 92, 4, 6, 151785) Mr. Sankaran said that Mahatma Gandhi approved another list of 1,607 Congressmen for offering satyagraha.
('80', 92, 4, 7, 151891) He said that 140 satyagrahis from the South including five ladies, are now marching towards Delhi.
('80', 92, 4, 8, 151990) Mahatma Gandhi has insisted that satyagrahis from the South should learn Hindi if they are to march towards Delhi.

('80', 92, 8, 12, 152191) NARANDAS, I liked your letter very much.
('80', 92, 8, 13, 152232) Your ideal is fine indeed; but Kanaiyo will not be able to reach it.
('80', 92, 8, 14, 152301) His mind was firm before Abha came into the picture.
('80', 92, 8, 15, 152354) People have noticed that since then he has been unconsciously letting himself be drawn towards her.
('80', 92, 8, 16, 152454) When I asked him, he felt that it was true.
('80', 92, 8, 17, 152498) We can put off the engagement for the present, but that would only be like deceiving the people.
('80', 92, 8, 18, 152595) The condition of Kanaiyo’s mind, so far as I can see, is as follows: ‘If I marry, it will be Abha, and if I cannot get Abha, I would prefer to remain unmarried.’ My view is that Abha should wait for three or four years.
('80', 92, 8, 19, 152815) Abha is of course growing fast.
('80', 92, 8, 20, 152847) Even after my death, he will marry nobody but Abha.
('80', 92, 8, 21, 152899) He is not of such an unsteady mind that he may change it any time.
('80', 92, 8, 22, 152966) Besides, Abha seems to me to be a noble type of girl.
('80', 92, 8, 23, 153020) Though she is not highly educated, she is lively.
('80', 92, 8, 24, 153070) She understands Gujarati even today.
('80', 92, 8, 25, 153107) She always talks with Ba in that language.
('80', 92, 8, 26, 153150) If both of them stay there, she will not spare herself in service.
('80', 92, 8, 27, 153217) She would willingly serve anybody she is asked to serve.
('80', 92, 8, 28, 153274) I shared your keen desire, but Kanaiyo does not have the strength to

('80', 93, 1, 4, 153569) If Kanaiyo must marry, then from our point of view Abha is the chosen one.

('80', 93, 4, 8, 153746) 164. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
('80', 93, 5, 9, 153774) SEVAGRAM, March 6, 1941
('80', 93, 6, 10, 153798) I must warn the public against journalistic flights of imagi nation.
('80', 93, 6, 11, 153867) No importance need be attached to my visits to Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and there meeting quite accidentally Kunver Sir Jagdishprasad, then Pandit Malaviyaji and the morning following Shri Vijayalakshmi Pandit and finally Maulana Saheb Abul Kalam Azad.
('80', 93, 6, 12, 154117) They were all of them friendly visits wholly unarranged when I left Sevagram for Allahabad.
('80', 93, 6, 13, 154209) I had gone for one mission and that alone.
('80', 93, 6, 14, 154252) What little other work I did was purely accidental.
('80', 93, 6, 15, 154304) I refer to my meeting some students and Garhwali workers.
('80', 93, 6, 16, 154362) Sir Tej Bahadur I went to see because he was ailing.
('80', 93, 6, 17, 154415) We are old friends.
('80', 93, 6, 18, 154435) He was to have come to see me but when I heard that he was ill I insisted on going to him.
('80', 93, 6, 19, 154526) No doubt, we talked about the political situation and even more about the Hindu Muslim problem.
('80', 93, 6, 20, 154622) Sir Jagdish who dropped in and who was to dine at Sir Tej Bahadur’s joined the conversation.
('80', 93, 6, 21, 154715) But not the slightest political importance attaches to these conversations.
('80', 93, 6, 22, 154791) We talked as individuals and not with regard to any mission.
('80', 93, 6, 23, 154852) Sir Tej Bahadur is anxious (who is not?) to end the present deadlock.
('80', 93, 6, 24, 154922) He would give anything to bring about Hindu Muslim unity.
('80', 93, 6, 25, 154980) He ascribes to me overmuch capacity for bringing about unity.
('80', 93, 6, 26, 155042) Sir Jagdish is no less anxious.
('80', 93, 6, 27, 155074) But the talks were no more than a friendly interchange of views.
('80', 93, 6, 28, 155139) As to the visits to Malaviyaji Maharaj, the same thing happened.
('80', 93, 6, 29, 155204) He has aged.
('80', 93, 6, 30, 155217) He ought not to talk about current events.
('80', 93, 6, 31, 155260) He is too weak.
('80', 93, 6, 32, 155276) But the country’s affairs are his daily food.
('80', 93, 6, 33, 155322) He will cease to think about them when he ceases to read and think of the Bhagvata

('80', 94, 1, 2, 155528) and the Gita.
('80', 94, 1, 3, 155542) These things are the breath of his life and they will stop with the stoppage of his last breath.
('80', 94, 1, 4, 155639) Who knows but that he will take them where the disembodied spirit goes.
('80', 94, 1, 5, 155711) It was a privilege to meet these friends but our talks have no bearing on the political situation in the country.
('80', 94, 1, 6, 155825) And there could be none in the purely prison visits to the Maulana and Shri Vijayalakshmi Pandit.
('80', 94, 1, 7, 155923) I know that the imaginary descriptions of such visits and the eagerness with which the public devour them show their desire for communal unity and a solution of the political deadlock.
('80', 94, 1, 8, 156108) But mere desire will take us no nearer its fulfilment.
('80', 94, 1, 9, 156163) For fulfilment can only come through common action on the part of those who share the desire.
('80', 94, 1, 10, 156257) All are searching for common action.
('80', 94, 1, 11, 156294) Speculation interferes with the search.
('80', 94, 1, 12, 156334) So far as the Congress is concerned, its policy and action based thereon are well known.
('80', 94, 1, 13, 156423) It is gross misrepresentation to suggest that the Congress is out for securing terms for itself.
('80', 94, 1, 14, 156520) Freedom of speech is for all even as independence will be for all.
('80', 94, 1, 15, 156587) The contents of the latter will be decided not by the Congress but by the vote of all.
('80', 94, 1, 16, 156674) And if it is to be achieved non violently it follows that the mere vote of the majority will have little play.
('80', 94, 1, 17, 156785) The charter of independence must be the product of the willing consent of the minorities and other relevant interests which are not in conflict with the interests of the vast mass of Indian humanity.
('80', 94, 1, 18, 156985) Be this as it may, in order that all the units may have full freedom of expression even against the war itself, the Congress has embarked upon civil disobedience.
('80', 94, 1, 19, 157148) That is the contribution of the Congress to the fulfilment of the common desire.
('80', 94, 1, 20, 157229) As an effort in direct action it must hold the field till a better is found.
('80', 94, 1, 21, 157306) Strong objection has been raised against my interpretation of the Bombay resolution.
('80', 94, 1, 22, 157391) I regard it as a true interpretation.
('80', 94, 1, 23, 157429) But it is that of an individual.
('80', 94, 1, 24, 157462) I have no authority from the Congress to interpret or vary the Congress resolutions.
('80', 94, 1, 25, 157547) That is essentially the function of the President, the Working Committee and finally the A.I.C.C. The.
('80', 94, 1, 26, 157650) only authority I have is to conduct the campaign of civil disobedience.
('80', 94, 1, 27, 157722) But when the time for settlement comes it will be for the Working Committee to decide what the terms shall be.
('80', 94, 1, 28, 157833) My contribution will be confined to advising the Committee.
('80', 94, 1, 29, 157893) The Working Committee may reject the interpretation I have given.
('80', 94, 1, 30, 157959) It or the A.I.C.C, may even alter the resolutions they have passed.
('80', 94, 1, 31, 158027) Meanwhile let everyone whether Congressmen or others be guided by the Bombay resolution and not
('80', 95, 0, 1, 158123) 96 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 95, 1, 2, 158164) by my interpretation.
('80', 95, 1, 3, 158186) I have, therefore, failed to understand the consternation created by my statement 1 that there can be no settlement short of independence during the pendency of the war.

('80', 95, 9, 18, 158790) SUSAI, Your case is hard.
('80', 95, 9, 19, 158816) But the remedy is in your hands.
('80', 95, 9, 20, 158849) If the Church is as bad as Hinduism, and if you have no conscientious scruples, you should revert to your original faith.
('80', 95, 9, 21, 158971) If you do not, surely you should suffer the fate of reformers and purge the Catholic Church of the blot.

('80', 95, 12, 25, 159406) Gandhiji expressed denial of the answer in Harijan, 28 7 1940 (vide “Impossible”), and suggested to the addressee to have the mistake rectified.

('80', 96, 12, 24, 160741) Regarding your honesty, have no doubt; but carelessness is a great defect.
('80', 96, 12, 25, 160816) In accounts there should

('80', 97, 1, 2, 160882) not be a mistake even of a pie.
('80', 97, 1, 3, 160914) A pie entered more or less in accounts can result in a mistake of a thousand, and it has happened before.
('80', 97, 1, 4, 161020) Accounts should be written daily.
('80', 97, 1, 5, 161054) Not only this, every item should be entered then and there, as is done in banks.
('80', 97, 1, 6, 161135) It is not good that you have given up [writing the accounts] What Chimanlal said was correct, but by asking his pardon you should have kept the work to yourself.
('80', 97, 1, 7, 161297) This can be done even now if you wish.
('80', 97, 1, 8, 161336) The atonement for this is that whatever the deficit make it up by getting the money from home.
('80', 97, 1, 9, 161431) Clearly specify the reason for doing so.
('80', 97, 1, 10, 161472) There is no cause for shame.

('80', 105, 6, 9, 171959) If you have read Harijan carefully, you would have known his views on the militarization of India or indeed any country.
('80', 105, 6, 10, 172080) A satyagrahi who believes in out and out non violence can never stand for militarization of India under any circumstances.
('80', 105, 6, 11, 172203) But such are few and far between.
('80', 105, 6, 12, 172237) The majority believe in non violence for achieving our independence but cannot get as far as condemning war weapons and machinery for defence from external aggression.
('80', 105, 6, 13, 172405) This, as you rightly say, requires boundless faith in non violence as a living creed and the only way to save the world from destruction.

('80', 109, 7, 11, 178099) The Parting of the Ways should have appeared when it was finished, i.e., immediately after August 10. By some mischance it has escaped publication till now.
('80', 109, 7, 12, 178256) It has just come into my possession.
('80', 109, 7, 13, 178293) I understand that some portions of the article have already appeared in Asia.
('80', 109, 7, 14, 178371) I think it is too precious a document to be withheld from the public.
('80', 109, 7, 15, 178441) I have shown it to Dr. Rajendra Prasad and Acharya Kripalani who are in Wardha.
('80', 109, 7, 16, 178521) They agree with me that it should be published on behalf of the A.I.C.C. I know that Sarojini Devi, if she was here, would also agree.
('80', 109, 7, 17, 178656) I believe that it correctly represents in moderate, though forcible language, the Congress position.
('80', 109, 7, 18, 178757) The passages quoted above 2 are key paragraphs.
('80', 109, 7, 19, 178805) The first extract shows what might have been.
('80', 109, 7, 20, 178851) The second declares the author’s love for the British people.
('80', 109, 7, 21, 178913) The third shows in the fewest possible words how the British Government in India is sustained by coercion pure and simple.
('80', 109, 7, 22, 179036) The fourth paragraph shows that the independence India wants is neither exclusive nor antagonistic to any nation.
('80', 109, 8, 23, 179150) 1 Written by Jawaharlal Nehru, this article dated August 10, 1940, was published by the A.I.C.C. on March 18, 1941. 2 Vide “Extracts from “Parting of the ways”.
('80', 110, 0, 1, 179311) VOL. 80 : 28 DECEMBER, 1940 17 AUGUST, 1941 111
('80', 110, 1, 2, 179359) Though the author has said not one word about non violence, he has led the reader to the inevitable conclusion that the independence of Jawaharlal’s conception, nay, Congress conception cannot be won except through unadulterated non violence, and the present struggle is an attempt to keep the spirit of non violence alive in the midst of the fratricidal inhuman carnage.
('80', 110, 1, 3, 179731) If it is a contribution to India’s freedom it is no less contribution to world peace.

('80', 110, 11, 14, 180209) MRIDULA, I have read your statement about Vikasgriha 2. Pushpabehn 3 and you seem to be working hard and devoting yourselves to public service.
('80', 110, 11, 15, 180353) You, therefore, desire to serve both men and women.
('80', 110, 11, 16, 180405) Your institution is a valuable shelter for poor girls.
('80', 110, 11, 17, 180460) You have the strength for such a tough job.
('80', 110, 11, 18, 180504) May God increase it.
('80', 110, 11, 19, 180525) The obstacles created by elders are a painful thing.
('80', 110, 11, 20, 180578) But it is good that all are not of that type.
('80', 110, 11, 21, 180624) If some of them obstruct your work, there are others who help you.

('80', 111, 1, 3, 180922) But the best remedy for the goondaism that you see is a vigilant public opinion.
('80', 111, 1, 4, 181003) In order to cultivate it you should give publicity to incidents of that type.
('80', 111, 1, 5, 181081) Your scheme for a building for the Vikasgriha is a good one.
('80', 111, 1, 6, 181142) Of course, the utmost simplicity will have to be observed.
('80', 111, 1, 7, 181201) The building and style of living [of the inmates] should be such as will befit a poor country like India.
('80', 111, 1, 8, 181307) You certainly deserve financial help for this building project.

('80', 111, 4, 13, 181505) [Before March 17, 1941]
('80', 111, 5, 14, 181529) Don’t bring persons from villages into towns for offering satyagraha.
('80', 111, 6, 15, 181599) Satyagrahis, if not arrested, may do house to house propaganda but it should not take the form of picketing.
('80', 111, 6, 16, 181708) Satyagrahis should not enter the houses where they are not welcome.
('80', 111, 7, 17, 181776) Persons serving in local bodies should resign from the services before offering satyagraha.
('80', 111, 8, 18, 181868) When a Congress Committee is suspended, its work should be entrusted to an approved satyagrahi.
('80', 111, 9, 19, 181964) Lady satyagrahis, if unable to march to Delhi, may tour in their own districts and province.
('80', 111, 10, 20, 182057) Satyagrahis marching to Delhi should obtain a working knowledge of Hindustani.
('80', 111, 11, 21, 182136) Satyagrahis charged under the Nuisance Act may not offer any defence.
('80', 111, 11, 22, 182206) They may make it clear that their sole intention was to carry on anti war propaganda, and plead not guilty to the nuisance charge.
('80', 111, 12, 23, 182337) Harijan Congress workers should devote themselves to constructive work.
('80', 111, 13, 24, 182409) Satyagrahi prisoners may refuse food only if it is unwholesome and uneatable.
('80', 111, 14, 25, 182487) Satyagrahis who are let off with fines should continue the satyagraha without giving a fresh notice.
('80', 111, 15, 26, 182588) Satyagrahis able to pay the fine may not evade payment, but are not bound to

('80', 112, 1, 2, 182808) sell their property to pay it.
('80', 112, 2, 3, 182839) For the facility and convenience of village folk, non arrested satyagrahis should be provided with a certificate or a badge on the authority of the Provincial Congress Committee, testifying to his being an approved satyagrahi.
('80', 112, 2, 4, 183066) The badge may differ from province to province.
('80', 112, 3, 5, 183114) Satyagraha may not be offered in a place where Section 144 is in force.
('80', 112, 4, 6, 183186) Fetters and handcuffs, etc., should be borne cheerfully when being transferred from one jail to another.
('80', 112, 4, 7, 183291) Non arrested satyagrahis marching to Delhi should, besides raising anti war slogans and otherwise carrying on anti war propaganda, propagate the constructive programme of the Congress.
('80', 112, 4, 8, 183476) It must be explained to the masses that the best and most effective as also the easiest way in which they can help forward the struggle is by carrying out the constructive programme laid before the country by our leader.

('80', 113, 6, 22, 185552) WARDHAGANJ, March 18, 1941
('80', 113, 7, 23, 185579) The handsome public response to the Kamala Nehru Memorial Hospital 4, though late, yet not too late, prompts this appeal.
('80', 113, 7, 24, 185701) Even as I had made that collection my special duty because of the promise made by me to Kamala when she went to Europe, as it turned out, to meet death, so is incumbent on me the duty of collection for the Andrews Memorial.
('80', 113, 7, 25, 185925) I might have failed in collecting for the Kamala Memorial but for the tireless labours of Dr. Jivraj Mehta.
('80', 113, 7, 26, 186033) I have no counterpart to Dr. Jivraj Mehta for the Andrews Memorial collection.
('80', 113, 7, 27, 186112) The first anniversary of Deenabandhu’s death will be soon upon us.
('80', 113, 7, 28, 186179) I am too weak and too occupied to travel about for collections.
('80', 113, 7, 29, 186243) What is, however, tantalizing is the fact that the collections have not been coming promptly and spontaneously.

('80', 114, 1, 2, 186698) everybody’s friend in need.
('80', 114, 1, 3, 186726) He made no distinction between the high and the poor or Christians and non Christians or Englishmen and others.
('80', 114, 1, 4, 186838) He ungrudgingly assisted all who were in need of his help.
('80', 114, 1, 5, 186897) He slaved night and day for humanity.
('80', 114, 1, 6, 186935) He found his home and self expression in Santiniketan.
('80', 114, 1, 7, 186990) Dr. Rabindranath Tagore was his guru and friend.
('80', 114, 1, 8, 187039) He was the chief collector of funds for Santiniketan.
('80', 114, 1, 9, 187093) No more fitting memorial could, therefore, be conceived than that his home should never be in want and that it should have additional funds for expansion.
('80', 114, 1, 10, 187248) Indeed the Gurudev himself should command all the monetary help he needs.
('80', 114, 1, 11, 187322) He has brought lustre to India.
('80', 114, 1, 12, 187354) Many men have derived signal assistance from him and his institution.
('80', 114, 1, 13, 187424) Their children are receiving instruction in Santiniketan.
('80', 114, 1, 14, 187482) His art decorates many an Indian home.
('80', 114, 1, 15, 187521) His poetry, his novels, plays and his art enrich the minds of thousands of boys and girls, men and women.
('80', 114, 1, 16, 187627) It is a problem why these two precious names have not brought forth spontaneous response.
('80', 114, 1, 17, 187717) Why should there be special appeals made on behalf of a memorial which is its own compelling recommendation?
('80', 114, 1, 18, 187826) A spontaneous response will delight Deenabandhu’s spirit and put new life into Rabindranath Tagore.
('80', 114, 1, 19, 187926) What answer have students and teachers, friends of labour and lovers of art to make?
('80', 114, 1, 20, 188011) Among them they can produce the paltry Rs. 5,00,000 in a day.
('80', 114, 1, 21, 188073) Will they produce the amount before the 5th April, the day on which Deenabandhu, that true friend of the poor, took sleep from which he never awoke?

('80', 115, 11, 20, 189410) DEAR SIR MIRZA3, I must thank you for your most affectionate letter.
('80', 115, 11, 21, 189479) I have never doubted your personal affection for me, I was going to say even partiality.
('80', 115, 11, 22, 189568) These are things I treasure.
('80', 115, 11, 23, 189597) They please me but what I want is true co operation, if my mission of peace and goodwill is to succeed.

('80', 116, 0, 1, 189950) VOL. 80 : 28 DECEMBER, 1940 17 AUGUST, 1941 117
('80', 116, 1, 2, 189998) Since you would know what I would like, I reduce to writing my thoughts as they come to me.
('80', 116, 1, 3, 190090) I am quite clear in my mind that there is little real freedom of speech in British India, there is still less in ‘Indian India’ and there is no independent judiciary.
('80', 116, 1, 4, 190257) Unfortunately you hold a different view.
('80', 116, 1, 5, 190298) Hence there is not much prospect of co operation.
('80', 116, 1, 6, 190348) I am sure you will one day be convinced of this fundamental truth.
('80', 116, 1, 7, 190415) Till then we must agree to differ.
('80', 116, 1, 8, 190450) Your Chief Justice is wholly unfit for the post he holds.
('80', 116, 1, 9, 190508) How can there be real justice !
('80', 116, 1, 10, 190540) I know that in British India too there have been unfit Chief and other Justices.
('80', 116, 1, 11, 190621) My point is that they become worse on going to the States.
('80', 116, 1, 12, 190680) I feel these things keenly because I am the only true friend among public men of the Princes.
('80', 116, 1, 13, 190774) This is a high but true claim.
('80', 116, 1, 14, 190805) You are about to leave.
('80', 116, 1, 15, 190829) How I wish you can see truth as I feel it!
('80', 116, 1, 16, 190872) By way of palliative you can restore the sanads and redress the wrong done to those candidates who were rejected.
('80', 116, 1, 17, 190986) 1 Such a step will be appreciated.
('80', 116, 1, 18, 191021) It won’t be of much use because the lawyers have turned the punishment to good account and they have become workers.
('80', 116, 1, 19, 191138) The rejected candidates have reconciled themselves to the rejection.
('80', 116, 1, 20, 191207) But as a gesture, if you can take the step, it will have a value.
('80', 116, 1, 21, 191273) Don’t please expect Bhashyam or others to seek an interview with you but send for them as friends.
('80', 116, 1, 22, 191372) Trust will beget trust.
('80', 116, 1, 23, 191396) Surely the first step should be yours.
('80', 116, 1, 24, 191435) I am asking Pattabhi 2 to see you as early as he can.
('80', 116, 1, 25, 191489) I know that even in your retirement, you will be doing useful service.
('80', 116, 1, 26, 191560) May you have many years before you and may you be an instrument for doing some truly big work.
('80', 116, 1, 27, 191655) Your sandal wood box is always by my side and holds my odds and ends.
('80', 116, 1, 28, 191725) This is a personal letter.
('80', 116, 1, 29, 191752) I am not copying it.
('80', 116, 1, 30, 191773) I have not written it for any public use, nor do I expect a reply unless you feel like sending one.

('80', 118, 5, 16, 193988) I had taken the letter to Allahabad.
('80', 118, 5, 17, 194025) I could not get a minute there.

('80', 118, 5, 22, 194251) Congratulations to all.
('80', 118, 5, 23, 194275) You yourself have got this valuable opportunity for clarifying your thoughts.
('80', 118, 5, 24, 194353) It is but natural that people expect a lot from you.
('80', 118, 5, 25, 194406) Maulana has somehow not been able to go beyond two parts.

('80', 118, 5, 27, 194519) He will send it.
('80', 118, 5, 28, 194536) Superficial non violence is when a man is not killed or even attacked physically.
('80', 118, 5, 29, 194618) The subtle kind is when no one is hurt in thought, word or deed and when the welfare of all mankind is at heart.
('80', 118, 5, 30, 194731) In normal circumstances the idea of non violence is limited to man only.
('80', 118, 5, 31, 194804) But truly speaking there is no limit at all.
('80', 118, 5, 32, 194849) It can be extended to animals and even germs.
('80', 118, 5, 33, 194895) But one does not go that far nor can one do so.
('80', 118, 5, 34, 194943) But non violence is normally extended to animals.
('80', 118, 5, 35, 194993) I do not talk of such non violence in respect of the Congress.
('80', 118, 5, 36, 195056) Nor can one do so.
('80', 119, 0, 1, 195075) 120 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 119, 1, 2, 195117) would not suit the Muslims.
('80', 119, 1, 3, 195145) Nor would it suit Christians and countless Hindus.
('80', 119, 1, 4, 195196) So the observance of subtle non violence about which I talk is limited to man.
('80', 119, 1, 5, 195275) I think it is enough if we reach that stage.
('80', 119, 1, 6, 195320) Something is bound to come out of it in due time.

('80', 120, 8, 27, 197343) March 21, 1941
('80', 120, 9, 28, 197358) The National Week 2 will be soon upon us.
('80', 120, 9, 29, 197400) Its observance has a double purpose: (1) to achieve self purification through fasting on the 6th and 13th April, and (2) to increase mass consciousness by greater concentration on constructive work.
('80', 120, 9, 30, 197599) The 6th of April 1919 saw exhibition of a sudden and unexpectedly high spirit of swadeshi and mass manifestation of communal unity and a determination on the

('80', 121, 1, 3, 198104) The spirit of swadeshi centred itself on khadi as it was the central village industry of a universal character.
('80', 121, 1, 4, 198216) During the twenty years since 1919 the constructive programme has widened.
('80', 121, 1, 5, 198291) The other village industries have found expression through the A.I.V.I.A. 1. Education has been linked with the villagers through Hindustani Talimi Sangh.
('80', 121, 1, 6, 198446) There has been greater concentration on impressing women in the national service and, therefore, regarding them as valued co workers on a par with men.
('80', 121, 1, 7, 198598) The widening and working of the constructive programme is the only way in which active non violence can express itself.
('80', 121, 1, 8, 198718) Civil disobedience comes, if it must, at the end of the constructive programme, never in the beginning.
('80', 121, 1, 9, 198822) We saw through experience that we had to retrace our steps in 1919 as civil resistance had been resorted to without preparation through constructive service.
('80', 121, 1, 10, 198980) Disobedience of laws can never be civil unless the resisters have learnt the art of voluntary obedience.
('80', 121, 1, 11, 199085) This is impossible without tangible co operative work requiring exact discipline and voluntary and whole hearted obedience to rules and regulations.
('80', 121, 1, 12, 199234) Civil resistance is merely lawful and obligatory only in some cases, whereas constructive work is obligatory on all who belong to a non violent organization.

('80', 125, 2, 3, 204616) SEVAGRAM, March 22, 1941
('80', 125, 3, 4, 204641) KRISHNACHANDRA, What you said yesterday was correct, and was timely.
('80', 125, 3, 5, 204710) If you are still not satisfied, ask again and again.
('80', 125, 3, 6, 204763) The matter is important.
('80', 125, 3, 7, 204788) Therein lies the test of ahimsa.
('80', 125, 3, 8, 204821) Both were attracted towards each other.
('80', 125, 3, 9, 204861) If this is considered a defect and they are turned out, their lives can be embittered.
('80', 125, 3, 10, 204948) If we tolerate them, their self control can increase, and they can progress step by step.
('80', 125, 3, 11, 205038) Their progress depends on us.
('80', 125, 3, 12, 205068) This line of thought is in favour of their staying [in the Ashram], and this should be sufficient.
('80', 125, 3, 13, 205167) We should put up with the temper of others to the extent that we ourselves are not weighed down by it.
('80', 125, 3, 14, 205270) A proof of this is that others are influenced by us.
('80', 125, 3, 15, 205323) This is an outward proof.
('80', 125, 3, 16, 205349) Inner proof is the testimony of the soul.
('80', 125, 3, 17, 205391) If our fearlessness goes on increasing, it is ahimsa, otherwise it is cowardice.
('80', 125, 3, 18, 205472) It may be said that in Kocharab [Ashram] 1 the whole work was in order.
('80', 125, 3, 19, 205544) The other things were subject to it.
('80', 125, 3, 20, 205581) In outward work there was there the same discipline that I had in South Africa.
('80', 125, 3, 21, 205661) I used to engage the visitors in the Ashram work or they left soon after they came.
('80', 125, 3, 22, 205745) My physique could bear the strain of laborious work, so I could take part in every activity; and it may be said that I was in constant touch with all.
('80', 125, 3, 23, 205896) There was one big living room.
('80', 125, 3, 24, 205927) So it was easy to come in touch with others.
('80', 125, 3, 25, 205972) This is about the early stage.
('80', 125, 3, 26, 206003) Whole work means to fill water early in the morning, to wash clothes, to cook food, to clean grains and vegetables, to serve food, to teach, and so on.
('80', 125, 3, 27, 206155) These things being one after the other were not troublesome.
('80', 125, 3, 28, 206216) The rest of the questions were answered yesterday.
('80', 125, 3, 29, 206267) Your letter is enclosed.

('80', 126, 8, 10, 206953) But while I may personally discuss every aspect with them, I could not, without consultation with the members of the Working Committee, give them any assurance, armed with which they might go to the Viceroy.
('80', 126, 8, 11, 207161) For they would need the assurance on behalf of the Congress Working Committee and I have no authority to give it.
('80', 126, 8, 12, 207275) There will be this obvious handicap, but otherwise I should be only too glad to meet them.
('80', 126, 8, 13, 207366) They may come with great expectations and I may fail to satisfy them.
('80', 126, 8, 14, 207436) Otherwise of course I could not have the slightest objection to meeting them.

('80', 129, 1, 2, 210895) there is any need to send for all family members.
('80', 129, 1, 3, 210945) If the lady doctor also is of the same opinion, get the operation done at once.
('80', 129, 1, 4, 211025) There is no danger at all in opening the abdomen.
('80', 129, 1, 5, 211075) I think it absolutely necessary to find out about the tumour.
('80', 129, 1, 6, 211137) Even if all of them come over, they will not be of much help.
('80', 129, 1, 7, 211199) Why, then, incur expenses on travelling and so on?
('80', 129, 1, 8, 211250) It is necessary to observe certain limits in every matter.
('80', 129, 1, 9, 211309) Show this letter to everybody.

('80', 129, 5, 15, 211649) I did not like the pencil handwriting and so she re wrote the portion in ink.

('80', 129, 9, 21, 211916) PRABHUDAYAL, Write to Shri Ramji Sharma that Mahadevbhai has already sent his opinion about Sainik.
('80', 129, 9, 22, 212016) We are fighting on behalf of Sainik and do not want to publish it under any other name.
('80', 129, 9, 23, 212104) The greatest need is for dharma and determination.
('80', 129, 9, 24, 212155) Your article is worthless.
('80', 129, 9, 25, 212182) It is grossly exaggerated.
('80', 129, 9, 26, 212209) A considerable part of Shastriji’s body is still very clear.
('80', 129, 9, 27, 212270) There is not much of a stink.
('80', 129, 9, 28, 212300) I do not spend hours on him.
('80', 129, 9, 29, 212329) These days I don’t even give him massage.
('80', 129, 9, 30, 212371) I have already told you that your language is superficial because your thoughts are such.
('80', 129, 9, 31, 212461) You do not honour truth as much as you should.
('80', 129, 9, 32, 212508) If at all you wish to write

('80', 130, 5, 9, 212929) You never doubted the welcome you were to receive there.
('80', 130, 5, 10, 212986) I did not.
('80', 130, 5, 11, 212997) I hope Tofa 1 remembers us all.
('80', 130, 5, 12, 213029) I know your love of flowers.
('80', 130, 5, 13, 213058) But I cannot give you satisfaction here.
('80', 130, 5, 14, 213099) The place is much too disorganized for sporting flower beds.
('80', 130, 5, 15, 213160) Harijan will be out on 5th April unless some mishap prevents it.
('80', 130, 6, 16, 213225) Probably it will be Ahmedabad.
('80', 130, 6, 17, 213256) Chandrashanker seems to have neglected his duty to an unforgivable extent.
('80', 130, 6, 18, 213331) I am hoping that he has not been wilfully dishonest.
('80', 130, 6, 19, 213384) But neglect such as he seems to have shown produces almost the same result.
('80', 130, 6, 20, 213460) I am keeping well in spite of the heat.
('80', 130, 7, 21, 213500) BAPU [PS.] Amtul Salaam is doing well.

('80', 134, 8, 12, 217992) If personally I had some inkling of it, I would have told you.
('80', 134, 8, 13, 218055) As I was in a hurry I did not write.
('80', 134, 8, 14, 218092) The underlying problem is that man is not so simple.
('80', 134, 8, 15, 218145) If anyone tells as soon as passion arises in him, then this Ashram would become heaven.
('80', 134, 8, 16, 218233) Afterwards it may or may not result in marriage.
('80', 134, 8, 17, 218282) 2 was able to hide his passion.
('80', 134, 8, 18, 218314) When I asked him he admitted it.
('80', 134, 8, 19, 218347) If their behaviour was not disapproved by others, who knows how far the two would have gone.
('80', 134, 8, 20, 218440) So the correct rule would be that as soon as passion arises, one should let it be known.
('80', 134, 8, 21, 218529) But who will do this?
('80', 134, 8, 22, 218551) So I stick to the old saying that as we are and as we shall be so would others be.

('80', 135, 1, 4, 219034) To expel .
('80', 135, 1, 5, 219045) 1 would be equally unjust.
('80', 135, 1, 6, 219072) For disobeying the rules everyone should be dismissed.
('80', 135, 1, 7, 219127) To expel a person who sincerely admits his mental attitude would be intolerance.

('80', 135, 6, 16, 219587) There is no absolute merit in jail going.

('80', 135, 6, 24, 219993) Let the satyagrahis work in their districts and organize them, if they will not march towards Delhi.
('80', 135, 6, 25, 220094) In any event a vast majority will always be outside.
('80', 135, 6, 26, 220147) If they are organized fully, none need court imprisonment.
('80', 135, 6, 27, 220206) The Maulana’s arrest is of course unfortunate, but it had to come.

('80', 140, 9, 20, 226112) Deep inside me I have an ever growing faith that in the midst of this universal destruction due to bloodshed, I am carrying on an absolutely innocuous struggle which, however, is pregnant with great potentialities.
('80', 140, 10, 21, 226327) The movement, for the conduct of which I am responsible, may prove a vain effort, if I represent no one but myself; and if I remain true to my faith, I may be satisfied, but so far as world peace is concerned, the effort will prove inadequate in terms of the present.
('80', 140, 10, 22, 226595) For producing the desired result during the lifetime of the present generation, it will be necessary to give an unmistakable demonstration that a substantial part of the nation is behind the effort.

('80', 141, 1, 4, 227035) Man can only make an honest attempt.
('80', 141, 1, 5, 227072) In a satyagraha movement, the saying that God is the giver of the result is literally true.
('80', 141, 1, 6, 227164) Therefore, it is faith that sustains me and it is faith that must sustain the other satyagrahis.
('80', 141, 1, 7, 227261) We have only begun the battle.
('80', 141, 1, 8, 227292) The real test, the real suffering, has yet to come.
('80', 141, 1, 9, 227344) Let me repeat for the thousandth time that, in this long and arduous struggle, quality alone will count, never quantity.
('80', 141, 1, 10, 227465) In this there is no room for hatred, certainly not for camouflage.
('80', 141, 1, 11, 227532) Despite my being the originator of this struggle, I venture to say that only through it can we hope for permanent world peace.

('80', 143, 7, 19, 230442) But there is no sickness just now.
('80', 143, 7, 20, 230477) Things are difficult here.
('80', 143, 7, 21, 230504) I had announced resumption of Harijan but a letter 2 from the Government compelled me to countermand the announcement.
('80', 143, 7, 22, 230623) Kamala has got a good training ground in a big hospital in Bombay and thanks to Dr. Jivraj Mehta.

('80', 143, 7, 24, 230745) Chandel is carrying on in Khedi.

('80', 144, 3, 4, 231199) DEAR IDIOT, I have your two letters today.
('80', 144, 3, 5, 231242) That accounts for the absence of yesterday’s.
('80', 144, 3, 6, 231288) I have given you a definite opinion about women.
('80', 144, 3, 7, 231337) Shah has not come near me yet.
('80', 144, 3, 8, 231368) Farooqui won’t be able to exploit my letter 1 much or for any length of time.
('80', 144, 3, 9, 231446) The position I have taken up is sound almost in all such cases.
('80', 144, 3, 10, 231510) There need never be any fear of going to arbitration.
('80', 144, 3, 11, 231564) The choice of a judge or judges is always under one’s control.
('80', 144, 3, 12, 231627) I agree with you that the Congress should not seek to organize students as a party.
('80', 144, 3, 13, 231711) But who can prevent individual Congressmen ?
('80', 144, 3, 14, 231756) You must not take such things to heart.
('80', 144, 3, 15, 231796) After one has done one’s best, it is always wise to let events take their course.
('80', 144, 3, 16, 231878) About the Punjab Congress affairs, I am not so agitated as you are.
('80', 144, 3, 17, 231946) In a big democratic organization, action cannot be taken all of a sudden.
('80', 144, 3, 18, 232020) It must represent good men as well as bad men.
('80', 144, 3, 19, 232067) If the sum total is bad, it will be utterly discredited.
('80', 144, 3, 20, 232124) Therefore without in any way worrying yourself, you bring me all the facts you can and I will see what action is possible.
('80', 144, 3, 21, 232247) Not much money has come in, in reply to my appeal.
('80', 144, 3, 22, 232298) 2 Malkani has gone to Ahmedabad and Delhi for the purpose.
('80', 144, 3, 23, 232357) He will get some, I am sure.
('80', 144, 3, 24, 232386) If nothing comes in, I shall have to go to some places myself.
('80', 144, 3, 25, 232449) Let us see.
('80', 144, 3, 26, 232461) I am still fit.
('80', 144, 3, 27, 232477) Amtul Salaam is decidedly better.
('80', 144, 3, 28, 232511) So is Bhagawati.
('80', 144, 3, 29, 232528) Janakibehn occupies Ba’s seat and Madalasa yours.
('80', 144, 3, 30, 232578) The former is taking normal food.
('80', 144, 3, 31, 232612) The latter still requires care.

('80', 145, 3, 6, 233121) Since you both are so keen, I will send Urmi back.
('80', 145, 3, 7, 233172) I do not feel like doing so as she is progressing satisfactorily.
('80', 145, 3, 8, 233238) I will be on the lookout for someone to send her with.

('80', 146, 12, 21, 234783) She would do whatever I ask her.
('80', 146, 12, 22, 234816) She does not like giving up the programme here nor does she wish to disregard the wishes of you both.
('80', 146, 12, 23, 234918) I suggest that you should come over here in May and let Urmi stay on.

('80', 148, 1, 3, 236431) The powers belong to the office and not to the man holding it.
('80', 148, 1, 4, 236494) So nobody need worry what sort of a man the manager is.
('80', 148, 1, 5, 236550) This means “No blame attaches to the strong, my Lord,” says Tulsidas.
('80', 148, 1, 6, 236620) In English it is: “The King can do no wrong.” Among us Indians this fault finding is almost universal.
('80', 148, 1, 7, 236723) From where can we find a perfect manager ?
('80', 148, 1, 8, 236766) It is needless to ask how Chimanlal is.
('80', 148, 1, 9, 236806) His analysis of merits and defects was correct.
('80', 148, 1, 10, 236854) If I can find time to go to that kitchen, I will certainly do so, and carry my milk with me, because I do not consider it second rate.
('80', 148, 1, 11, 236989) That one is inexpensive and this one is costly.
('80', 148, 1, 12, 237037) Perhaps there condiments are allowed and here they are not.
('80', 148, 1, 13, 237097) In case no incon venience is felt there, it would no doubt be good if anyone of us some time go there.
('80', 148, 1, 14, 237200) In view of his temperament what Chimanlal said to Sushila was proper.
('80', 148, 1, 15, 237270) Now it is time to stop.

('80', 148, 7, 22, 237683) 1According to Amrita Lal Chatterjee, who was an inmate of Sevagram Ashram, in a letter dated January 8, 1941, he had “suggested to Gandhiji that the Ashramites should keep a personal diary of their work, thoughts and ideas that come in their way, and place them before Gandhiji for his perusal so that he could know the mind and work of each and every Ashramite, and make necessary suggestions.
('80', 148, 7, 23, 238078) Gandhiji accepted the idea, and the system of keeping a personal diary was introduced from April 1.” In his diary dated April 1, Amrita Lal Chatterjee had recorded a talk between him and Kanu Gandhi, Gandhiji’s personal attendant, regarding “a subdued suspicion and whisperings of two particular sisters in the Ashram about the friendly relation that was developing between Kanu Gandhi and Abha (now Abha Gandhi) daughter of Amrita Lal Chatterjee”, and had sought Gandhiji’s advice.

('80', 149, 3, 6, 238788) Whoever he may be, respect is due to the post.
('80', 149, 3, 7, 238835) Victoria became queen at the age of seventeen.
('80', 149, 3, 8, 238882) Old Palmerston 1 knelt before her.
('80', 149, 3, 9, 238917) This is British etiquette.
('80', 149, 3, 10, 238944) Victoria was immature.
('80', 149, 3, 11, 238967) Still Palmerston did not hesitate.
('80', 149, 3, 12, 239002) What have you to do with Chimanlal?
('80', 149, 3, 13, 239038) I am in a delicate position.
('80', 149, 3, 14, 239067) If in my presence only the will of the manager prevails, the order is maintained; if it does not prevail then there could be no order.
('80', 149, 3, 15, 239202) If there were no order here then it would be nowhere, and then satyagraha would disappear.

('80', 151, 6, 19, 242212) It is for you to find out a way of living that will satisfy you, for who else can understand what will satisfy you?

('80', 151, 6, 21, 242372) And as for being released from me, that will be possible only when you ask for it.

('80', 152, 5, 14, 243483) The fact is I never have your letters before me at the time of replying.

('80', 153, 3, 4, 244196) MUNNALAL, Better is death in the discharge of one’s duty; another’s duty is frought with danger.
('80', 153, 4, 5, 244293) You must, therefore, concentrate at present on your examinations.

('80', 153, 4, 10, 244550) That village may be regarded as reformed, where everybody wears khadi, which produces all the khadi it needs, in which every inhabitant spends some of his time in one or more processes relating to cotton, which uses only oil produced in indigenous oil presses, which consumes only jaggery manufactured in the village itself or in its neighbourhood and only hand milled flour and hand pounded rice; the village, in other words, where the largest possible number of village industries are flourishing, in which nobody is illiterate, where the roads are clean, there is a fixed place for evacuation, the wells are clean, there is harmony among the different communities, and untouchability is completely absent, in which everybody gets cow’s milk, ghee, etc., in moderate quantities, in which nobody is without work, and which is free from quarrels and thefts, and in which the people abide by the sevak’s advice in all matters.

('80', 159, 3, 4, 252506) I have never undertaken to read diaries word for word.
('80', 159, 3, 5, 252561) I gave most attention to yours.
('80', 159, 3, 6, 252593) To be read, you must be brief.
('80', 159, 3, 7, 252624) You are prolix.
('80', 159, 3, 8, 252640) You have written almost an essay.
('80', 159, 3, 9, 252674) I have read all the marked parts.
('80', 159, 3, 10, 252708) I can give no guarantee as to the pay.
('80', 159, 3, 11, 252747) You will get what you are worth.
('80', 159, 3, 12, 252780) Anything more will be charity.
('80', 159, 3, 13, 252811) Today you are a burden and you will be still greater when you are studying.
('80', 159, 3, 14, 252887) But if you begin to earn, you reduce the burden and will presently save.
('80', 159, 3, 15, 252960) This means hard and honest labour.
('80', 159, 3, 16, 252995) I hope you will do this.
('80', 159, 3, 17, 253020) You are not attending to your diet.
('80', 159, 3, 18, 253056) You must control it or let Dr. Das control it.
('80', 159, 3, 19, 253103) I am quite sure, I was right in stopping massage.
('80', 159, 3, 20, 253153) You are becoming too soft.

('80', 159, 7, 23, 253295) [Before April 7, 1941]
('80', 159, 8, 24, 253318) I am firmly of the opinion that, if the constructive programme is assiduously and successfully worked out to its end, the helpless will find themselves possessing power they never had before, and that is the truest foundation for the swaraj of millions based on non violence.

('80', 159, 10, 26, 253625) 1 According to Amrita Lal Chatterjee, Sailendra Nath Chatterjee had noted in his diary, dated April 6, “that he was sorry that Gandhiji did not read his diary fully .
('80', 159, 10, 27, 253792) that he was prepared to give up further studies and join service, if his father and Gandhiji desired so, and if it offered a decent pay and future prospects.
('80', 159, 10, 28, 253950) Sailendra Nath had also mentioned about the trouble he had, because of his taking rather too much food after a long fast.” 2 The message was for its fourth session, held on April 7. 3 The reference is to the non stop spinning performed in connection with the National Week observed from the 6th to the 13th April.

Weight of the slivers of each of the spinners; 2. amount of yarn produced thereby; 3. amount of refuse; waste yarn to be collected; it has its own use; 4. count of the yarn produced, its tensile strength and evenness; 5. every gundi 4 should be accompanied by the spinner’s name.

('80', 160, 8, 10, 254858) There is not much in it.
('80', 160, 8, 11, 254883) Ba often makes it.
('80', 160, 8, 12, 254902) And it will be often made if I would allow it.
('80', 160, 8, 13, 254949) Gram flour makes it too nutritious for all but the heavy work labourers.
('80', 160, 8, 14, 255022) The proportion of bhaji is not enough.
('80', 160, 8, 15, 255061) Our bread is far superior and any day lighter.
('80', 160, 8, 16, 255108) I am glad you have been able to finish your Jullundur work.
('80', 160, 8, 17, 255168) Ba might have to give a month to Delhi.
('80', 160, 8, 18, 255208) Sushila expects to cure her completely.
('80', 160, 8, 19, 255248) She may drop in for two days.
('80', 160, 8, 20, 255278) I do not think I ever met Sardar Sunder Singh.
('80', 160, 8, 21, 255325) I am, therefore, not writing.

('80', 161, 2, 3, 255569) SEVAGRAM, April 7, 1941
('80', 161, 3, 4, 255593) 1. I have said my say.
('80', 161, 3, 5, 255616) You will grow only if you find that the plus side is greater than the minus side.
('80', 161, 3, 6, 255698) It is strange but true that a person is affected by a thing as he imagines it to be not as it really is.
('80', 161, 3, 7, 255803) Thus the two Sikh brothers who lived here told me that the shortcomings they saw they were prepared for, but the new and good things they saw in the Ashram filled them with admiration.
('80', 161, 3, 8, 255988) The Bengali detenu who was here (I forget his name) saw nothing or little that was good.
('80', 161, 3, 9, 256077) The truth no one knows, not even I the author.
('80', 161, 3, 10, 256124) God only knows what this place is.
('80', 161, 3, 11, 256159) 2. Of course Vina and Abha can stay here, if they know the art of living in the midst of suspicion.
('80', 161, 3, 12, 256259) 3. Sailen is a tough problem.
('80', 161, 3, 13, 256289) I fear he will be a burden to himself and to you and society.

('80', 162, 7, 17, 257677) What is the harm if you get fewer opportunities of staying with me?
('80', 162, 7, 18, 257745) It is but natural that you wish to come over.
('80', 162, 7, 19, 257791) But are all our wishes always fulfilled?

('80', 162, 7, 22, 257951) Ba is still in Delhi.

('80', 163, 3, 4, 258437) I have seen what purports to be a report 1 by some ‘special correspondent’ of an interview by Shri Mukundlal Sircar and Shri R. S. Ruikar with me.
('80', 163, 3, 5, 258584) I have no hesitation in saying that it is a mischievous distortion of a friendly conversation.
('80', 163, 3, 6, 258679) I rarely give interviews.
('80', 163, 3, 7, 258705) When I do, I insist on seeing the draft before publication.
('80', 163, 3, 8, 258765) So far as I know, there was no one in my cottage who could send any reports.
('80', 163, 3, 9, 258842) I should hope that none of the two friends has become a ‘special correspondent’.
('80', 163, 3, 10, 258923) I repeat my request that Editors will confer a favour on me if, before publishing interviews with me, they will make sure that I have authorized them.

('80', 163, 7, 19, 259411) Your Lahore programme is strenuous.
('80', 163, 7, 20, 259447) I shall heave a sigh of relief when you are back in your corner.
('80', 163, 7, 21, 259512) How nice not to have a room but a corner or even a part of a wall.
('80', 163, 7, 22, 259579) Nevertheless when the hot wind blows as it is, while I am writing this, I feel tempted to say, pass a month or so at Simla.

('80', 166, 6, 17, 262851) He had an arduous programme.
('80', 166, 6, 18, 262880) How I have anticipated you!
('80', 166, 6, 19, 262908) I suddenly remembered that you had written to me about the porch.
('80', 166, 6, 20, 262974) The idea is sound.
('80', 166, 6, 21, 262993) But the addition will be made after your return.
('80', 166, 6, 22, 263042) In my case the workmen are few and the work much.
('80', 166, 6, 23, 263092) Therefore nothing can be rushed.
('80', 166, 6, 24, 263125) Nor is there any hurry.
('80', 166, 6, 25, 263149) I am simply delighted with the change I have made in the library.
('80', 166, 6, 26, 263215) It has proved a positive blessing to Madalasa.
('80', 166, 6, 27, 263262) She rests there from 10 to 2.30 p.m.
('80', 166, 6, 28, 263299) Amtul Salaam also often rests there and has her hip baths.
('80', 166, 6, 29, 263358) The door too opens.
('80', 166, 6, 30, 263378) Mira has gone to Chorwad, a seaside place in Kathiawar.
('80', 166, 6, 31, 263434) What an escape you had!
('80', 166, 6, 32, 263458) But life is made of a series of escapes, living as we are in the midst of death.
('80', 166, 6, 33, 263539) Do avoid overwork.

('80', 167, 8, 12, 264073) I heard from Mahadev that you were quite seriously ill.
('80', 167, 8, 13, 264129) Now take complete rest.
('80', 167, 8, 14, 264153) I had warned you.
('80', 167, 8, 15, 264171) One should never work beyond one’s strength.
('80', 167, 8, 16, 264216) But that is a thing of the past.
('80', 167, 8, 17, 264249) If you take care of the present, everything will be all right.
('80', 167, 8, 18, 264312) Mahadev says that your party has broken up and you are depressed about that; but that is unnecessary.
('80', 167, 8, 19, 264414) You have done your best; why need you worry then ?
('80', 167, 8, 20, 264465) Many other factors and circumstances contribute to the outcome, and surely you cannot be the master of all of them?
('80', 167, 8, 21, 264581) What you have done is enough.
('80', 167, 8, 22, 264611) If you get well completely, you will again be able to influence the Corporation irrespective of whether you have a party behind you.

('80', 168, 3, 4, 264884) DEAR MAURICE, I have your letter.
('80', 168, 3, 5, 264918) I never thought of your fast.
('80', 168, 3, 6, 264948) I was under the impression that you were fed here.
('80', 168, 3, 7, 264999) I hope you were none the worse for it.
('80', 168, 3, 8, 265038) I was painfully conscious that I could not give you any satisfaction for your theory.
('80', 168, 3, 9, 265124) The worst of it is that those who seek support for their theories cannot be easily satisfied, if at all, except when you agree with them.
('80', 168, 3, 10, 265262) This is no drawback.
('80', 168, 3, 11, 265283) It often means strength.
('80', 168, 3, 12, 265308) Where would all the discoverers and inventors have been, if they had given in at the first sign of opposition.
('80', 168, 3, 13, 265419) Therefore you need not be disappointed if you have a living faith in your theory.

('80', 172, 3, 4, 269519) PREMA, I had your letter written from Saswad.
('80', 172, 3, 5, 269565) Yesterday I got the one written from jail.
('80', 172, 3, 6, 269608) I was delighted to read the account of conditions there.
('80', 172, 3, 7, 269665) I am sure that, if all the women live in harmony and do constructive work with faith, they will bring swaraj nearer.
('80', 172, 3, 8, 269782) On the 6th everybody here, excepting the children and the sick, fasted for twenty four hours.
('80', 172, 3, 9, 269876) Today also we intend to do the same.
('80', 172, 3, 10, 269913) Non stop working of some charkhas, one carding bow and several taklis is in progress.
('80', 172, 3, 11, 269999) Babla and Kanu had a big hand in arranging this.
('80', 172, 3, 12, 270048) All are working with zeal.
('80', 172, 3, 13, 270075) And now for your questions: 1. All that I can say about fasting is that it is part of my life.
('80', 172, 3, 14, 270170) A fast may come any time.
('80', 172, 3, 15, 270196) At the moment, however, I am not thinking of any.
('80', 172, 3, 16, 270246) But my strength comes from the possibility of my undertaking one and from my faith in the method.
('80', 172, 3, 17, 270344) In the last resort a satyagrahi vindicates his honour by laying down his life, as one who believes in violence does by killing.
('80', 172, 3, 18, 270472) What a big difference!
('80', 172, 3, 19, 270495) Let nobody, therefore, look upon the possibility of a fast by me as the sword of Damocles.
('80', 172, 3, 20, 270586) If the fast does come, welcome it and pray that God may grant me the strength to go through it.
('80', 172, 3, 21, 270682) 2. Harijan was stopped because of an unexpected letter 1 from Delhi.
('80', 172, 3, 22, 270751) I could see from it that they were not well disposed towards the paper, and I do not want it to be made an issue in this struggle.
('80', 172, 3, 23, 270882) 3. The current political developments have had no effect on me, for I have realized that nothing is possible just now.
('80', 172, 3, 24, 271001) That is why I have said that this is going to be a long struggle.
('80', 172, 3, 25, 271067) On the whole our good lies in that.
('80', 172, 3, 26, 271103) Mahadev has again gone today to Bombay for a day.
('80', 172, 3, 27, 271153) He has gone leaving Durga ill here.
('80', 172, 3, 28, 271189) Both are courageous.

('80', 174, 3, 7, 272754) Though I am under eighteen, I have known enough of the student world and the world outside to realize the necessity of discipline in everything.
('80', 174, 3, 8, 272899) In the step I have taken I have, therefore, obtained the blessings of my parents and other elders.
('80', 174, 3, 9, 272998) Under my parents I have had practical training in non violence in every detail of life.
('80', 174, 3, 10, 273086) I have just finished my matriculation examination.
('80', 174, 3, 11, 273137) I began school work rather late in life.
('80', 174, 3, 12, 273178) My parents had stopped our regular school work during the non co operation days of 1920 when I was not even born.
('80', 174, 3, 13, 273292) My parents have brought us all up in a free atmosphere.
('80', 174, 3, 14, 273348) And so when I was minded to go to school and go through the ordinary training, I was permitted to do so.
('80', 174, 3, 15, 273453) When, however, the present struggle was started, my mind began to waver and I felt that the practical experience I should gain in the pursuit of freedom would be of far greater value than the ordinary schooling which every schoolboy knows is conceived not so much in the interest of the masses as that of the rulers.
('80', 174, 3, 16, 273770) If in spite of that knowledge we go through that course, it is because it is the only one that has been in vogue for so many years and which serves the purpose of providing a status in life.
('80', 174, 3, 17, 273961) Such is the fate to which we have been reduced through foreign domination.
('80', 174, 3, 18, 274036) I have been attracted to the present struggle more for its moral worth than the political.
('80', 174, 3, 19, 274127) I know that if India can present a completed example of non violence, India will have made a unique contribution to human progress.
('80', 174, 3, 20, 274259) It is a vision that holds my youthful mind and I would count no suffering too great to achieve an end so noble and glorious.

('80', 175, 3, 5, 274908) I am somewhat late answering.
('80', 175, 3, 6, 274938) Yes, uneven and weak yarn is, like a counterfeit coin, useless.
('80', 175, 3, 7, 275002) I have received some very fine specimens from the jails.
('80', 175, 3, 8, 275059) My health is quite good and so is Kumarappa’s.
('80', 175, 3, 9, 275106) Yes, I saw Maulana Saheb in Naini Jail.
('80', 175, 3, 10, 275146) He was quite well, and so was Vijaylakshmi who has now been discharged.
('80', 175, 3, 11, 275218) Sardar is keeping well and spinning during all his spare hours.
('80', 175, 3, 12, 275282) Kumarappa too is in good order and condition.
('80', 175, 3, 13, 275328) He will leave today for Coonoor for a change.
('80', 175, 3, 14, 275374) Rajen Babu is keeping well.

('80', 175, 7, 19, 275512) April 15, 1941 Neither boys nor elders should indulge in idle jokes either between themselves or with girls.
('80', 175, 7, 20, 275621) While discussing work there is a place for innocent pleasantries.
('80', 175, 7, 21, 275687) That is an art.
('80', 175, 7, 22, 275703) But unless there is adequate reason for talking, observing silence is best.
('80', 175, 7, 23, 275779) This is the root of purity in speech.
('80', 175, 7, 24, 275817) There is much filth and refuse lying around the Ashram.
('80', 175, 7, 25, 275873) Someone from amongst us should assume responsibility for keeping the surroundings clean.
('80', 175, 7, 26, 275962) 1 It need hardly be emphasized that cleanliness is an essential part of non violence.

('80', 177, 9, 21, 278608) Her staying with you is certainly a different thing from your occasionally visiting her.
('80', 177, 10, 22, 278697) Letters to Pyarelal have been received.
('80', 177, 10, 23, 278737) I shall have them sent on to him if that can be done.

('80', 181, 5, 13, 283349) I adhere to all that I said at the initiation of the struggle 2. When I launched out, I had no foolish illusion about a sudden miracle happening.
('80', 181, 5, 14, 283495) It was conceived to be, and it remains, a silent declaration of unquenchable faith in the power of non violence even in the midst of circumstances so terrible and so baffling as face the world today.
('80', 181, 5, 15, 283695) I believe more in the efficacy of the incalculable force of inscrutable divinity than in the efficacy of the calculated and calculable forces that the combined powers of destruction can bring into play on this little planet.
('80', 181, 5, 16, 283920) That incalculable force has somehow or the other to act through human agency.
('80', 181, 5, 17, 283998) How and when I cannot say.
('80', 181, 5, 18, 284025) Whether that agency is the Congress or not, I cannot say.
('80', 181, 5, 19, 284083) I proceed upon the faith that today the Congress is the only organization, however imperfect, however wanting in faith as an organization, still the only organization that stands definitely for peaceful measures.
('80', 181, 5, 20, 284296) That being my position, so far as I am concerned, there is no drawing back.
('80', 181, 5, 21, 284372) Whether civil disobedience is offered by one or many is of no moment.
('80', 181, 5, 22, 284442) It must continue against all odds.
('80', 181, 5, 23, 284477) Congressmen can

('80', 182, 1, 2, 284728) certainly repudiate it in more ways than one.
('80', 182, 1, 3, 284774) It will then cease to be an organizational movement, and therefore I will admit it will cease to be effective in any shape or form.
('80', 182, 1, 4, 284906) But I would be content if I still retain the faith to be the solitary witness of the power of non violence.
('80', 182, 1, 5, 285014) I must resolutely deny that this movement, whether in conce ption or in execution, is communal or anti Muslim or anti English.
('80', 182, 1, 6, 285141) There is sufficient evidence for those who want to notice it to show that extraordinary precaution is being taken to keep the movement within limits and absolutely innocuous.
('80', 182, 1, 7, 285316) Many Government people have admitted that it is wholly ineffective according to their conception.
('80', 182, 1, 8, 285414) The writer of the article has said as much from his standpoint.
('80', 182, 1, 9, 285478) And both are right.
('80', 182, 1, 10, 285498) It was never intended that it would create an appreciable impression upon the war effort, but it is a moral, and from that standpoint a grand protest against the conduct of the war in the name of a free people.
('80', 182, 1, 11, 285709) It is a token of the yearning of a political organization to achieve the freedom of 350,000,000 people through purely non violent effort and therefore to affect the future destiny of the world.
('80', 182, 1, 12, 285903) Again an ambitious claim, but it is there.
('80', 182, 1, 13, 285946) If I can help it, the Congress will disdain freedom at the sacrifice of a single legitimate interest that is consistent with the interests of the dumb millions, whether they are Hindus, Muslims or others.
('80', 182, 1, 14, 286151) I must deny that if the Congress had held on to office in the seven provinces the Pakistan cry would have been less loud than it is today; but the giving up of office had an infinitely more moral basis than the avoidance of a tussle with Muslim interests or any other interests.
('80', 182, 1, 15, 286430) The fundamental basis was India’s dissociation from the war effort to which it was never invited to be party.
('80', 182, 1, 16, 286540) This is putting it in its lowest term and in bald political language.
('80', 182, 1, 17, 286610) As you snow, my own basis is still more abstract, still more moral and still more universal, but on that account none the less real or less practical.
('80', 182, 1, 18, 286761) I make bold to say that when the clash of arms has ceased and we have settled down to peace, permanent or impermanent, history will record that the Congress fight in its totality was a supremely moral fight and free from any injury to man’s dignity.
('80', 182, 1, 19, 287011) To conclude this very unsatisfactory reply, as it would appear, to a friendly gesture, I want to plead one thing.
('80', 182, 1, 20, 287125) Would friends ask me at this supreme moment in the life of the world and my own life, to deny a faith that has sustained me for nearly half a century?
('80', 182, 1, 21, 287276) And let me
('80', 183, 0, 1, 287287) 184 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 183, 1, 2, 287329) interpolate one thought, however unwelcome it may be: I am con vinced that if Britain will only be true to India, then, whether the Congress withdraws the struggle or not, everything can be settled satisfactorily.
('80', 183, 1, 3, 287543) But unfortunately British statesmen have chosen the wrong path and have put imaginary obstacles in the way of India’s freedom.
('80', 183, 1, 4, 287670) But that is a chapter on which I have no desire to dilate.

('80', 183, 5, 8, 287817) DEAR LALA DUNICHANDJI,
('80', 183, 6, 9, 287840) I arrived here on the 16th evening but was only able to put your questions before Gandhiji yesterday.
('80', 183, 7, 10, 287942) 1. In regard to M.L.A.s who in spite of reminders do not court imprisonment the question had better wait for an answer in view of Mian Iftikhar ud din’s 1 pending early release.
('80', 183, 8, 11, 288120) 2. The same applies to A.I.C.C. members whose date has already been extended to the 30th instant.
('80', 183, 9, 12, 288218) 3. Gandhiji is agreeable to having the spinning and weaving of certified khadi test done by the A.I.S.A. appointees.
('80', 183, 9, 13, 288335) He is, however, in agreement with you that those who cannot afford to or for some equally legitimate reason are unable to present themselves before the appointed examiners and who can get the necessary certificate of bona fides from the President or Secretary of District Congress Committees may be exempted from the A.I.S.A. test.
('80', 183, 10, 14, 288667) 4. In regard to members of local bodies resigning, the matter had better wait till Mian Iftikhar ud din’s release.
('80', 183, 11, 15, 288782) 5. The same as regards Congressmen of all grades who refuse to offer civil disobedience.
('80', 183, 12, 16, 288871) 6. Members of the Provincial Congress Committees are included among the number that is to offer civil disobedience.
('80', 183, 13, 17, 288987) 7. Members of Working Committees of all grades are to offer civil disobedience.
('80', 183, 14, 18, 289067) 8. Gandhiji fears that no undertaking of loyalty to the movement will be worth anything with those who are determined to deceive.

('80', 184, 1, 2, 289295) Your list of 212 satyagrahis has come.
('80', 184, 1, 3, 289334) I note that the names have been accepted by the local President or Secretary and you told me that you had seen to it that these officers are reliable persons.
('80', 184, 1, 4, 289493) In any event we would like to have the answers to the questionnaire from each person from the local officers.
('80', 184, 1, 5, 289603) And what about a test for them?
('80', 184, 1, 6, 289635) How soon can the A.I.S.A. arrange for the latter?
('80', 184, 1, 7, 289685) There have been some complaints regarding the revisions undertaken by the Amicus curiae Bar Association Committee in Lahore.
('80', 184, 1, 8, 289810) Gandhiji’s opinion is that the idea of such a committee in itself is all right.
('80', 184, 1, 9, 289890) But it should be allowed to function on its own without any interest, instigation or interference in its work on the part of the satyagrahis.
('80', 184, 1, 10, 290032) You should issue strict injunctions to the latter in this regard.
('80', 184, 1, 11, 290098) I am afraid my programme must have tired you as it did me.
('80', 184, 1, 12, 290157) I trust you are rested by now and well.
('80', 184, 1, 13, 290197) With kind regards, Yours sincerely, AMRIT KAUR [PS.] Since writing the above your covering letter of the 15th instant has come in.

('80', 184, 3, 17, 290557) They are certainly harsh.
('80', 184, 3, 18, 290583) I am considering the matter.
('80', 184, 3, 19, 290612) What I would suggest is that an impartial arbitrator should be appointed and only such terms should be laid down as he accepts.
('80', 184, 3, 20, 290740) Strictly speaking, of course, every employer has a right to fix his own terms for recruitment and everyworker has a right to reject them.
('80', 184, 3, 21, 290878) It is up to one’s liking.
('80', 184, 3, 22, 290904) But since I know the press authorities I have suggested the appointment of an arbitrator.

('80', 185, 2, 3, 291151) SEVAGRAM, April 20, 1941
('80', 185, 3, 4, 291176) MY DEAR KHWAJA, I was much touched by your long letter.
('80', 185, 3, 5, 291232) I had your note too from Delhi.
('80', 185, 3, 6, 291264) I am glad you met Ba.
('80', 185, 3, 7, 291286) You will have no difficulty in believing me that I am the same confirmed believer in unity that you saw in 1919. Let me correct you about dates and facts.
('80', 185, 3, 8, 291441) I presided at the Hindi Sammelan in 1918 1 and that with the deliberate intention of making Hindi inclusive, not exclusive.
('80', 185, 3, 9, 291565) There was no criticism then of my presiding.
('80', 185, 3, 10, 291610) Muslim friends were enthusiastic about my definition of Hindi.
('80', 185, 3, 11, 291673) At that time it was only my definition when I presided.
('80', 185, 3, 12, 291729) Again my definition was accepted by the Sammelan.
('80', 185, 3, 13, 291779) How could there be criticism when I broadened the basis so as to give recognition to Urdu script on a Hindi platform?
('80', 185, 3, 14, 291897) The first note of opposition was sounded when I attempted to use Hindi as a term synonymous with Hindustani.
('80', 185, 3, 15, 292006) Again it was an attempt in the right direction.
('80', 185, 3, 16, 292054) But I had lost caste by then and every act of mine had begun to be suspect.
('80', 185, 3, 17, 292130) Into the causes for this phenomenon I need not go.
('80', 185, 3, 18, 292181) But from the above narrative it is clear that nothing that I have done could possibly be a cause for the Hindi Urdu controversy.
('80', 185, 3, 19, 292310) But the controversy having arisen, I could not escape unscathed.
('80', 185, 3, 20, 292375) I would not call the Sammelan 2 a communal organization any more than I would so call t he Urdu Anjuman 3. Both forms exist and votaries of both also exist.
('80', 185, 3, 21, 292532) There need be no rivalry between the two but the wretched spirit which has nothing to do with the languages pervadesevery department of life.
('80', 185, 3, 22, 292674) When it goes, as it will and must some day, the languages will remain what they are but they will provide us no food for quarrel.
('80', 185, 3, 23, 292804) Meanwhile both are subserving the common cause.
('80', 185, 3, 24, 292852) In the end the extreme forms which have no living reality behind them will disappear or will exist as corruptions of a past age.
('80', 185, 3, 25, 292981) Be that as it may, let us few keep our heads cool and do the right, cost what it may.

('80', 186, 11, 27, 294231) Pyarelal says that you should definitely not appear for the examination without full preparation.
('80', 186, 11, 28, 294329) Hence, he would rather that you did it either in October or April next.
('80', 186, 11, 29, 294401) I feel that if you are confident, you should certainly appear for the examination in May.
('80', 186, 11, 30, 294491) I for one believe firmly that medical service is a God given gift in your case and hence you will easily pass whenever you sit for the examination.

('80', 191, 1, 2, 300058) The problem is why do riots take place in spite of Congressmen functioning in all the three places—Dacca, 1 Ahmedabad and Bombay?
('80', 191, 1, 3, 300188) Congress influence is strongest in Ahmedabad, then in Bombay.
('80', 191, 1, 4, 300250) You are under a handicap.
('80', 191, 1, 5, 300276) Why were so many thousand people so helpless as to fail to defend their homes?
('80', 191, 1, 6, 300355) They could have done it either violently or non violently.
('80', 191, 1, 7, 300414) Congressmen must not be satisfied with mere relief work.
('80', 191, 1, 8, 300471) That is for social workers who have specialized in the field, such as the Marwari Relief Society.
('80', 191, 1, 9, 300569) Congressmen have to find out the why and the way to combat the evil.
('80', 191, 1, 10, 300638) You are a seasoned worker, no arm chair man.

('80', 191, 1, 13, 300786) If there are people who can be easily frightened, there must be those who will put them in fright.

('80', 192, 8, 19, 302797) Both these things should have an effect on the rectum.
('80', 192, 8, 20, 302852) Today almost everyone is on fast.

('80', 194, 5, 10, 304616) SUSHILA, I have your letter.
('80', 194, 5, 11, 304645) I have received all your letters concerning Ba and I have replied to all of them.
('80', 194, 5, 12, 304727) Since you had forbidden it, I have not written to Ba anything about her fever.
('80', 194, 5, 13, 304806) I know that you would not regard Ba as a burden.
('80', 194, 5, 14, 304855) Still, Ba does make demands on your time, does she not?
('80', 194, 5, 15, 304911) It irks me that you have to visit her twice every day.
('80', 194, 5, 16, 304966) Ba is only in your hands and so of course you will shower on her all you have.
('80', 194, 5, 17, 305045) But what would be my own duty in the matter?
('80', 194, 5, 18, 305090) And yet since Ba is there with you what more can I wish?
('80', 194, 5, 19, 305147) Hence, what you write is absolutely correct.
('80', 194, 5, 20, 305192) I am observing fast today.
('80', 194, 5, 21, 305219) 1 By the time this letter is in your hand, there will be hardly four or five hours left to end the fast.
('80', 194, 5, 22, 305324) I am not feeling anything today.
('80', 194, 5, 23, 305357) I am taking a lot of water.

('80', 194, 5, 25, 305452) Even if not, no harm can come in just twenty four hours.
('80', 194, 5, 26, 305509) The fast is undertaken on moral grounds.
('80', 194, 5, 27, 305550) I have been greatly perturbed that Sharad and Abha resorted to lying.
('80', 194, 5, 28, 305620) My conditions are such that they are bound to be broken, and when they are broken, one cannot help telling lies.
('80', 194, 5, 29, 305733) Therefore, I had no recourse except to observe a fast for my mental peace.
('80', 194, 5, 30, 305808) Give this information to Ba also.
('80', 194, 5, 31, 305842) I have not let this get around.
('80', 194, 5, 32, 305874) You too should tell no one except Ba.
('80', 194, 5, 33, 305912) Do not mention this to Lakshmi [or] Devdas.

('80', 195, 7, 7, 306532) WARDHA, April 25, 1941 I have read painfully the long report of the debate in the House of Commons on India.
('80', 195, 7, 8, 306641) Distress has been known to have softened people’s hearts and made them mindful of facts.
('80', 195, 7, 9, 306730) But Britain’s distress has evidently left Mr. Amery absolutely cold and untouched.
('80', 195, 7, 10, 306813) 1 This callousness makes me more than ever confirmed in my opinion that the Congress must abide by its policy of non violence in spite of the heavy odds facing it.
('80', 195, 7, 11, 306977) Mr. Amery has rendered no service to Great Britain by his contemptuous disregard of the situation as it exists in India and thefacts that stare one in the face.
('80', 195, 7, 12, 307138) He talks glibly of British rule having given peace to India.
('80', 195, 7, 13, 307199) Did he not know what was happening in Dacca and Ahmedabad?
('80', 195, 7, 14, 307258) Who was responsible for keeping the peace in these two places?
('80', 195, 7, 15, 307321) I hope he will not throw in my face the fact that Bengal, at any rate, has self government.
('80', 195, 7, 16, 307413) He knows what a mockery that self government is.
('80', 195, 7, 17, 307462) He knows what little power for such emergencies toy Ministers have, whether they wear the Congress label, the League label or any other.
('80', 195, 7, 18, 307599) I ask the very pertinent question: Why has this long spell of British rule left the people so emasculated as to disable them from standing up against a few hundred goondas?
('80', 195, 7, 19, 307772) It is a humiliating spectacle, more for the British than for us, to see thousands of people
('80', 195, 8, 20, 307864) 1 L. S. Amery, Secretary of State for India, moved a resolution in the House of Commons on April 22, 1941, to extend for another year the proclamation under which the Governors of Indian Provinces had assumed the powers of the Provincial Legislators.
('80', 196, 0, 1, 308115) VOL. 80 : 28 DECEMBER, 1940 17 AUGUST, 1941 197
('80', 196, 1, 2, 308163) running away from their homes through sheer fright, because a few hundred goondas have found a favourable atmosphere for resorting to arson, murder and loot The first act of any government worth the name would be to teach its people the art of self defence, but the foreign British Government had no concern about this fundamental welfare of India’s citizens and so it deprived the people of the use of arms.
('80', 196, 1, 3, 308572) All the handsome tribute that Mr. Amery pays to Indian troops falls flat on Indian soil, because, leaving aside Congress non violence for the time being, if India had been equipped and trained for self defence and if India had become a voluntary ally of Great Britain, I hold that all European Powers combined for destruction would not have touched Great Britain.
('80', 196, 1, 4, 308936) Mr. Amery has insulted Indian intelligence by reiterating ad nauseam that Indian political parties have but to agree among themselves and Great Britain will register the will of a united India.
('80', 196, 1, 5, 309130) I have repeatedly shown that it has been the traditional policy of Great Britain to prevent parties from uniting.
('80', 196, 1, 6, 309244) ‘Divide and rule’ has been Great Britain’s proud and ill conceived motto.
('80', 196, 1, 7, 309318) It is the British statesmen who are responsible for the divisions in India’s ranks, and the divisions will continue so long as the British sword holds India under bondage.
('80', 196, 1, 8, 309490) I admit that there is unfortunately an unbridgeable gulf between the Congress and the Muslim League.
('80', 196, 1, 9, 309591) Why do not British statesmen admit that it is after all a domestic quarrel?
('80', 196, 1, 10, 309667) Let them withdraw from India and I promise that the Gongress and the League and all other parties will find it to their interest to come together and devise a home made solution for the Government of India.
('80', 196, 1, 11, 309874) It may not be scientific; it may not be after any Western pattern; but it will be durable.
('80', 196, 1, 12, 309965) It may be that before we come to that happy state of affairs, we may have to fight amongst ourselves.
('80', 196, 1, 13, 310067) But if we agree not to invite the assistance of any outside power, the trouble will last perhaps a fortnight and it will not mean even one day’s destruction of human heads such as goes on in Europe today, for the simple reason that thanks to the British rule we are wholly unarmed.
('80', 196, 1, 14, 310349) Mr. Amery, in utter disregard of truth, misleads his ignorant audience that the Congress wants “all or nothing”.
('80', 196, 1, 15, 310462) Let me remind him that in order to placate British sentiment, the Congress descended

('80', 197, 1, 2, 310589) to the Poona Resolution 1 and when at Bombay it undid the Poona Resolution, 2 I authoritatively stated that the British Government could not at the present moment grant or declare India’s independence and that, therefore, for the time being, we should be satisfied with the complete freedom of speech and pen.
('80', 197, 1, 3, 310899) Was that “all or nothing”?
('80', 197, 1, 4, 310926) With Mr. Amery’s state of mind, I suppose it is too much to expect him to have the elementary grace to acknowledge the studied moderation of the Congress in its desire not to embarrass the British Government whilst it is fighting for its very existence.
('80', 197, 1, 5, 311180) Not having that grace, he turns the Congress moderation against it and claims that the Congress civil disobedience has fallen flat.
('80', 197, 1, 6, 311312) It took my breath away when I read his statement about India’s prosperity.
('80', 197, 1, 7, 311387) I say from experience that it is a legendary thing.
('80', 197, 1, 8, 311439) India’s millions are becoming progressively pauperized.
('80', 197, 1, 9, 311495) They are miserably clothed and underfed.
('80', 197, 1, 10, 311536) Because there is one man’s rule, he is able to produce a budget of millions.
('80', 197, 1, 11, 311613) But I make bold to say that it is not only no proof of the prosperity of the famishing millions, but it is proof positive that India is being ground down under the British heel.
('80', 197, 2, 12, 311791) It is the duty of every Indian who knows anything about the distress of the peasantry, to rise in rebellion against this autocratic rule.
('80', 197, 2, 13, 311929) Fortunately for humanity, India’s rebellion is a peaceful revolt and I hope it will be through exclusively peaceful effort that India will realize her natural destiny.
('80', 197, 2, 14, 312097) But I must not carry any further the painful dissection of Mr. Amery’s performance.
('80', 197, 2, 15, 312181) It hurts me to have to undertake even this very brief analysis of his speech.
('80', 197, 2, 16, 312259) But it is so amazingly misleading that I felt I would be failing in my duty if I did not point out at least some of the most glaring discrepancies in that unfortunate utterance.
('80', 197, 2, 17, 312437) Surely he could have rested content with the undisputed sway that he exercises over the destinies of over four hundred million people.

('80', 198, 2, 3, 313065) [April 25, 1941] 2
('80', 198, 3, 4, 313084) 1. In answer I must repeat my former statement that British statesmen and publicists have covered the whole Indian question with unreality.
('80', 198, 3, 5, 313224) The reality about the Times [of India] criticism is that nationalist India, for some reason or other, is against co operating in the war effort.
('80', 198, 3, 6, 313369) 3 But when one understands that the whole of India is a prison and that the jailers are able to make the prisoners do what they Iike, it is small wonder that the British Government is able to impress what money and recruits they like.
('80', 198, 3, 7, 313604) I have shown before now that the modern titled classes, including the ruling princes; are essentially a British creation.
('80', 198, 3, 8, 313726) 2. If the proposals 4 of the Bombay Conference are accepted in toto I shall admit that though the proposals are likely to be unacceptable by the Congress, their acceptance will be some evidence of a desire to part with power.
('80', 198, 3, 9, 313952) 3. To describe me as a dictator is laughable, if only because I have no sanction behind my instructions save the willing and affectionate endorsement thereof by Congressmen.
('80', 198, 3, 10, 314126) I have imposed no views on anybody.
('80', 198, 3, 11, 314162) Imposition of non violent views is a contradiction in terms.
('80', 198, 3, 12, 314223) It is true that I cannot change what is described as my policy because my policy is my creed.
('80', 198, 4, 13, 314317) I am amazed at Mr. Amery’s effrontery in saying that the Congress wants “all or nothing” and “refused even to discuss the matter”.
('80', 198, 4, 14, 314448) He knows that the Congress descended so far as to make the Poona offer and he should know that at Bombay when the Poona offer was withdrawn the Congress realized that the Government could not be expected at the present moment to grant the Congress demand, and therefore the resolution asked for freedom of speech which has been categorically refused.
('80', 198, 5, 15, 314799) 1 Enclosing this in his letter dated April 25, 1941, to Frank Moraes who had raised these questions on behalf of The News Chronicle, London, Mahadev Desai wrote: “Here is what G. has given in reply to questions 1, 2, 3 and 5. He wants to say nothing in reply to question 4.” 2 ibid 3 Vide “Statement to “The Times of India”, 19 4 1941 4 Vide “Non Party Leaders’ Conference Resolution”, 14 3 1941 5 What follows is presumably the answer to question 5.
('80', 199, 0, 1, 315250) 200 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 199, 1, 2, 315292) Equally false is the description of the Congress as a totalitarian body with totalitarian ambitions.
('80', 199, 1, 3, 315393) The essence of totalitarianism is that it should have violent sanction behind it.
('80', 199, 1, 4, 315475) Mr. Amery knows that the Congress is pledged to non violence and I challenge him to produce a single instance of an authoritative resort to violence by the Congress to impose its will upon its opponents.
('80', 199, 1, 5, 315679) On a par with the foregoing two statements is Mr. Amery’s assertion that “the main constitutional task is inevitably for the moment far more in the hands of Indians themselves than in ours” when he knows that there is nothing in the hands of the Indians themselves, except to perform the almost impossible task of undoing the traditional policy of ‘divide and rule’.
('80', 199, 1, 6, 316046) Imagine a Hitler in occupation of England and successfully dividing Englishmen as Indians are divided in India and then mocking at them by saying, ‘I will ratify an agreement among you.’ I assert that in India we have Hitlerian rule however disguised it may be in softer terms.
('80', 199, 1, 7, 316324) And since he has chosen to disregard truth, I must not wonder at his deliberately misleading an ignorant audience by saying that individual civil disobedience has created a situation naturally embarrassing as it was meant to be.
('80', 199, 1, 8, 316553) The written letter stands, and it is that the Congress by its civil disobedience did not mean to embarrass.
('80', 199, 1, 9, 316661) That it has not proved embarrassing is acknowledged by Mr. Amery himself in his speech when he declared with great gusto that the Congress action has not affected the war effort in any part of India, “generous funds having flowed in from every class for every purpose of war or for mitigation of suffering”.
('80', 199, 1, 10, 316969) Instead of paying a tribute to the exemplary moderation of the Congress, he has gracelessly accused a half century old organization of doing what it has never intended and what, in fact, it has never done.
('80', 199, 1, 11, 317175) It makes me sad to think that the distress through which Great Britain is passing today has not sobered Mr. Amery even to the extent of respecting cold fact.

('80', 200, 3, 6, 317614) He ought not to coerce his family.
('80', 200, 3, 7, 317649) He istherefore likely to take mental sannyasa and sever his connection with the family.

('80', 200, 3, 9, 317784) The two girls 3 he takes with him.
('80', 200, 3, 10, 317819) I think their place is with their mother with whom they have more in common than with Amrita Babu.
('80', 200, 3, 11, 317918) I would like you to advise and guide the family.
('80', 200, 3, 12, 317967) So long as they accept your guidance I shall continue to send the money I am sending.
('80', 200, 3, 13, 318053) I would like both the sisters to do some national service and earn their living.
('80', 200, 3, 14, 318134) But you will know better.
('80', 200, 3, 15, 318160) Amrita Babu has high ambition in the shape of service.
('80', 200, 3, 16, 318215) He would rather die in the attempt to still the rioters 4 than anything else.
('80', 200, 3, 17, 318293) You will guide.

('80', 206, 1, 2, 325650) 369. LETTER TO EDITOR, “THE TIMES OF INDIA”
('80', 206, 2, 3, 325694) May 1, 1941
('80', 206, 3, 4, 325706) DEAR SIR, You write 1:
('80', 206, 4, 5, 325729) Mr. Amery may well retort that the “discrepancies” with which Mr. Gandhi charges him are also evident in the Congress leader’s statement 2. Certainly the accusation that India has been “emasculated” because of the alleged British policy of keeping her ‘‘wholly unarmed” comes strangely from the arch protagonist of non violence.
('80', 206, 4, 6, 326058) In 1908 3 when I first expounded the life saving and the life giving truth of ahimsa I wrote that disarmament was the blackest page in British history in India.
('80', 206, 4, 7, 326219) I repeated the same thing in 1918 4 when I was collecting recruits for the British army with a zeal that brought me serious illness and a fair measure of unpopularity.
('80', 206, 4, 8, 326387) My statement passed muster then.
('80', 206, 4, 9, 326420) But times have changed and I have become inconsistent for stating an unchallengeable fact.
('80', 206, 4, 10, 326511) I suggest that non violence cannot be imposed upon anyone.
('80', 206, 4, 11, 326570) It has to come from within.
('80', 206, 4, 12, 326598) The British measure was undertaken to make British rule safe, not to make the people non violent.
('80', 206, 4, 13, 326696) It has made them impotent even for mischief.
('80', 206, 4, 14, 326741) Good, impotent persons 5 can never do.
('80', 206, 4, 15, 326780) It is no matter for pride or credit that one representative of the British power can hold in abject subjection, say, a village of 1,000 souls.
('80', 206, 4, 16, 326923) My non violence does admit of people, who cannot or will not be non violent, holding and making effective use of arms.
('80', 206, 4, 17, 327042) Let me repeat for the thousandth time that non violence is of the strongest, not of the weak.
('80', 206, 4, 18, 327136) It is a force mightier than violence, though radically different from it in quality and effect.

('80', 207, 8, 21, 328513) I understand that you are definitely appearing for the examination.
('80', 207, 8, 22, 328581) I have taken it for granted that you will pass the examination.
('80', 207, 8, 23, 328645) What you write about that girl is correct.
('80', 207, 8, 24, 328688) You would have felt more satisfied if you had examined her yourself.

('80', 209, 7, 10, 330622) DEAR KAMALA, Yes, I had all your letters.
('80', 209, 7, 11, 330664) 3 I should have written earlier, but I
('80', 209, 8, 12, 330703) 1 This was sent in reply to the addressee’s telegram dated May 2, which read: “Mr. Jinnah, without reference to me, has released for publication my letter to him dated 6th February and his reply to me dated 10th February, 1941. I ask your permission to publish our correspondence beginning with 25th January and ending with 10th March, 1941. Please wire.” In his statement dated May 4, the addressee explained: “After reading day before yesterday the statement of Mr. Jinnah in the newspapers, issued from Mysore, and the correspondence between him and me, which he has released to the Press, I sent day before yesterday evening a telegram to Mahatma Gandhi.
('80', 209, 8, 13, 331362) Last evening, I received the .
('80', 209, 8, 14, 331393) reply from the Mahatma.
('80', 209, 8, 15, 331417) As Mr. Gandhi is agreeable to my releasing the correspondence which has taken place between him and me, I am issuing it to the Press.
('80', 209, 8, 16, 331551) In his statement, Mr. Jinnah says that he showed his willingness ‘to meet Mr. Gandhi or any other Hindu leader to have a heart to heart conversation’.
('80', 209, 8, 17, 331702) He would have been more accurate if he had drawn attention to the following sentence in his own letter to me: ‘I have always been ready and willing to see Mr. Gandhi or any other Hindu leader on behalf of the Hindu community and do all I can to help in the solution of the Hindu Muslim problem.” The words ‘on behalf of the Hindu community’, which he has omitted in his statement, but which are found in his letter, would go to show that he wanted Mr. Gandhi to see him in that professed capacity.
('80', 209, 8, 18, 332200) Mr. Gandhi, as will appear from his letter, was not in a position to agree to this condition.
('80', 209, 8, 19, 332294) There the matter ended, and it was no use my carrying the matter further with Mr. Jinnah.
('80', 209, 8, 20, 332384) .” For Gandhiji’s letters to the addressee 2 ibid 3 Gandhiji had asked the addressee to send him a fortnightly diary while she was under training in midwifery.

('80', 210, 9, 19, 333413) 378. COMMUNAL RIOTS
('80', 210, 10, 20, 333433) SEVAGRAM, May 4, 1941 Hindu Muslim riots that have broken out in many important places in the country must have saddened all sane people.
('80', 210, 10, 21, 333571) My grief however is special.
('80', 210, 10, 22, 333600) The Congress influence seems to have been practically unfelt during the dark days.
('80', 210, 10, 23, 333683) We have proved ourselves barbarians and cowards in these places.
('80', 210, 10, 24, 333748) Arson, loot and killing of innocent people including children, have been common in almost all the places.
('80', 210, 10, 25, 333854) Thousands have run away
('80', 210, 11, 26, 333878) 1 According to the addressee this statement, dated May 1, was on “his mission to Dacca where a Hindu Muslim riot had broken out”.

('80', 211, 1, 2, 334104) from their homes for fear of their lives.
('80', 211, 1, 3, 334146) Congress influence was not to be measured by the number of members on the Congress register but by its leavening quality.
('80', 211, 1, 4, 334268) It has been shown clearly that the influence is negligible in riots and the like.
('80', 211, 1, 5, 334350) Individual cases apart, the Congress produced little or no influence over either the Muslims or the Hindus in the affected areas.
('80', 211, 1, 6, 334480) From the accounts received it seems that Muslim fanatics in Dacca and Ahmedabad did their worst in inflicting damage on Hindu property by looting and burning with a deliberation that showed premeditation.
('80', 211, 1, 7, 334685) Hindus, instead of boldly standing up and facing the mischief makers, fled in their thousands from the danger zone.
('80', 211, 1, 8, 334801) And where they did not, they were as barbarous as the assailants.
('80', 211, 1, 9, 334867) These were all untouched by the Congress non violence.
('80', 211, 1, 10, 334922) And yet these are the men who form the bulk of the Congress meetings.
('80', 211, 1, 11, 334992) If the Congress has no control over the masses on such occasions, there is not much value in Congress non violence as a positive force.
('80', 211, 1, 12, 335128) The Congress cannot take charge of the Government if the British suddenly withdraw.
('80', 211, 1, 13, 335212) They are not likely to do so without a desperate effort.
('80', 211, 1, 14, 335269) But British valour cannot make Congressmen brave or fit for shouldering the responsibility of Government.
('80', 211, 1, 15, 335375) At the present moment the British Government is preoccupied.
('80', 211, 1, 16, 335436) It is a marvel how they hold sway over four hundred million people.
('80', 211, 1, 17, 335504) Their amazing self confidence and their skill in the use of destructive weapons enable them to hold India in bondage.
('80', 211, 1, 18, 335622) But they may not be expected to keep the peace even to the extent they do in normal times.
('80', 211, 1, 19, 335713) They will ensure their control anyhow but they willallow us to kill one another and come in only when that control is in danger.
('80', 211, 1, 20, 335842) Congressmen’s course is clear.
('80', 211, 1, 21, 335873) They must examine the contents of their non violence.
('80', 211, 1, 22, 335927) If it does not go as far as the regulation of inter communal and such other relations, it is of no use for the acquisition of independence.
('80', 211, 1, 23, 336067) I prophesy that without pervasive non violence of the brave, when the question of real transfer of power comes, it won’t be the Congress who will have the privilege and the responsibility of delivering the goods.
('80', 211, 1, 24, 336280) The power will descend to those who are able to make effective use of violence.
('80', 211, 1, 25, 336360) In Europe two forces, equally matched in destructive skill and bravery, are ranged against one another.
('80', 211, 1, 26, 336464) The goal before both is domination.
('80', 211, 1, 27, 336500) In spite of all the will in the world, I have found no difference in kind between the two.
('80', 211, 1, 28, 336591) The difference in degree does not
('80', 212, 0, 1, 336625) VOL. 80 : 28 DECEMBER, 1940 17 AUGUST, 1941 213
('80', 212, 1, 2, 336673) interest me.
('80', 212, 1, 3, 336686) The British heel is bad enough for me.
('80', 212, 1, 4, 336725) As a man wedded to independence and non violence, I must fight Nazism and Fascism equally with the enslaving British Imperialism.
('80', 212, 1, 5, 336855) But has the Congress really the non violent strength even to fight this imperialism which we know through and through?
('80', 212, 1, 6, 336974) Hitherto it was a case of seizing power bit by bit.
('80', 212, 1, 7, 337026) But every Indian politician knows that there never was the slightest move on the part of the British to part with real power.
('80', 212, 1, 8, 337152) And now we have it in its nakedness from Mr. Amery that we may expect no such thing peacefully from British authority.
('80', 212, 1, 9, 337271) We have to fight for it either violently or non violently, whether it is the Congress or the League or the Hindu Mahasabha that fights for it.
('80', 212, 1, 10, 337414) I am satisfied that the two sectional organizations will never win independence for the masses, Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Parsi, Jew.
('80', 212, 1, 11, 337554) The Congress is the only organization that has laboured for national solidarity from the beginning.
('80', 212, 1, 12, 337654) But that labour will be vain if the Congress does not prove true to its trust.
('80', 212, 1, 13, 337733) I do not mind Congressmen changing their creed in spite of many leaders being in jail or openly leaving the Congress.
('80', 212, 1, 14, 337851) I can see my way to rebuilding the Congress with five true men with whom there is neither Hindu nor Muslim nor any other.
('80', 212, 1, 15, 337973) Religion is a personal matter.
('80', 212, 1, 16, 338004) It ought not to affect the political field.
('80', 212, 1, 17, 338048) Then what should a Congressman do?
('80', 212, 1, 18, 338083) He must resolutely refuse to take sides and defend with his life and without the use of violence the person who is in distress as did for instance three women in Ahmedabad.
('80', 212, 1, 19, 338256) I have no doubt there are many such individual instances unknown to me.
('80', 212, 1, 20, 338328) Cowards will never bring peace or independence.
('80', 212, 1, 21, 338376) He must therefore tell the masses never to fly from danger and that if they cannot follow his way they must defend themselves in the best way they can.
('80', 212, 1, 22, 338528) What is required is a brave heart—a possession which is in nobody’s giving and which therefore can never be taken away.
('80', 212, 1, 23, 338648) He must instil into his neighbours the lesson that even violence can be both decent and indecent.
('80', 212, 1, 24, 338746) It is no bravery to kill unawares an innocent person because he does not belong to one’s religion or to burn his property.
('80', 212, 1, 25, 338869) Those who do so disgrace their religion and themselves and positively mar the effort for independence.
('80', 212, 1, 26, 338972) Let me give some further illustrations of what a Congressman should do in given circumstances.
('80', 212, 1, 27, 339067) A Congressman has no enemy.
('80', 212, 1, 28, 339095) While he will not seek the protection of the police or the military, he will not interfere with them in the performance of their duty but he will not hesitate to lose his life
('80', 213, 0, 1, 339271) 214 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 213, 1, 2, 339313) if need be in checking them when they are partial or exceeding their authority.
('80', 213, 1, 3, 339393) This will appear a dangerous doctrine.
('80', 213, 1, 4, 339432) But it is not if it is enforced fully.
('80', 213, 1, 5, 339471) For if the Congressman concerned has erred, he will be the sufferer and not the police or the military.
('80', 213, 1, 6, 339575) I know that a young man, because he was brave, by timely interference saved perhaps a hundred lives by simply holding the bridle of an officer’s horse and telling him in firm accents, that he may not give the order to fire and that he—the young man—would reason with the crowd and disperse them.
('80', 213, 1, 7, 339871) Supposing there is a Hindu procession which has a right to pass through a Muslim locality and a Congressman has no influence over either, he will still give his life in begging a passage from the opposing Muslims.
('80', 213, 1, 8, 340085) The immediate result may be zero.
('80', 213, 1, 9, 340119) But the Congressman will have left a legacy of non violent bravery.
('80', 213, 1, 10, 340187) It will be good practice in non violence.
('80', 213, 1, 11, 340229) Let us learn from the British people the art of recklessly losing life and property.
('80', 213, 1, 12, 340314) The same rule applies to a Muslim procession passing through a Hindu locality.
('80', 213, 1, 13, 340393) We shall never learn the art of mutual forbearance and toleration till some of us, though perfectly innocent, have staggered Indian humanity by losing our lives.
('80', 213, 1, 14, 340555) A crowd is bent upon setting on fire the property of one community or another or desecrating a mosque or a temple.
('80', 213, 1, 15, 340670) Congr essmen whether one or many will give their lives to prevent mob fury.
('80', 213, 1, 16, 340746) A stray man attempts to stab a passer by.
('80', 213, 1, 17, 340788) At the risk of his life, a Congressman will pluck the knife out of the hands of the would be miscreant.
('80', 213, 1, 18, 340892) Congressmen may gasp on reading this note and particularly the illustrations and say ‘impossible’.
('80', 213, 1, 19, 340991) Well, attainment of indepen dence is still more impossible whether by violent or non violentmeans.
('80', 213, 1, 20, 341090) But what seems impossible to one lacking faith will become possible to those who have faith.
('80', 213, 1, 21, 341183) And it is said that faith can move mountains.
('80', 213, 1, 22, 341229) I know this, that neither independence nor communal unity is possible without ample sacrifice, bravery and self confidence which is but another name for faith.

('80', 217, 6, 16, 346686) BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS, Today I finished reading your article on the economic condition of India.
('80', 217, 6, 17, 346779) I liked it very much.
('80', 217, 6, 18, 346801) To do justice to it, a gist should be given in the beginning.
('80', 217, 6, 19, 346863) There should be more of such articles, and they should be printed in pamphlet form and translated.
('80', 217, 6, 20, 346962) If it is necessary to go to Bihar, I am fully prepared.
('80', 217, 6, 21, 347018) I read again about Schuster, etc.
('80', 217, 6, 22, 347052) I do not feel there is any need for suggestions from here.
('80', 217, 6, 23, 347111) We should put our own house in order and clean it.
('80', 217, 6, 24, 347162) Time is on our side.
('80', 217, 6, 25, 347183) They have to move forward.
('80', 217, 6, 26, 347210) We must secure control over things.
('80', 217, 6, 27, 347246) At least freedom of speech and the Press should be allowed and the detenus should be released.

('80', 218, 8, 11, 347806) DEAR BARDOLOI, I was delighted to have your letter.
('80', 218, 8, 12, 347858) You are certainly making the best use of your time.
('80', 218, 8, 13, 347910) I am glad too that you are all spinning.
('80', 218, 8, 14, 347951) I do not mind your writing about me.
('80', 218, 8, 15, 347988) 1 But you will offend all orthodoxy by bracketing me with the avatars or prophets and I think rightly.
('80', 218, 8, 16, 348091) You cannot write of a living man in the same way as of the dead who, by common consent, have been acclaimed as great teachers.
('80', 218, 8, 17, 348218) Your second question is difficult.
('80', 218, 8, 18, 348253) 2 I believe with those Muslims who think that the Prophet’s years in Mecca were the years in which he taught and lived pure non violence.
('80', 218, 8, 19, 348391) He became an administrator in Madina and thus ceased to be a pure teacher.
('80', 218, 8, 20, 348466) In any case the net effect of the Koran is that non violence is an obligation but violence is permissible.
('80', 218, 8, 21, 348573) We are bound to accept as authoritative the interpretation generally given by the Muslim world and not the one I have preferred.
('80', 218, 8, 22, 348702) As to Krishna’s advice to Arjuna you should read my
('80', 218, 9, 23, 348754) 1 The addressee who was in Jorhat Jail had sought Gandhiji’s permission to include a life sketch of Gandhiji in his Assamese book on religious teachers, meant for children.
('80', 218, 9, 24, 348927) 2 The addressee had wondered how to reconcile the ahimsa doctrine with the action of prophet Mahomed in Madina, where he took up arms, and Shri Krishna’s advice to Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita to fight.

('80', 219, 7, 11, 349555) But I read your letter only last evening.
('80', 219, 7, 12, 349597) As the matter is very important, I am giving a brief reply.
('80', 219, 7, 13, 349657) Mridula 3 is of course made of steel.
('80', 219, 7, 14, 349695) God will protect her.
('80', 219, 7, 15, 349717) I will not be satisfied with watchmen.
('80', 219, 7, 16, 349756) I am assuming that the truly non violent can be counted on one’s fingers.
('80', 219, 7, 17, 349830) The others should defend themselves.
('80', 219, 7, 18, 349867) If this is not done, the same story will repeat itself.
('80', 219, 7, 19, 349923) Keep this in mind in whatever you plan.
('80', 219, 7, 20, 349963) Those who employ watchmen will not be able to rule.
('80', 219, 7, 21, 350015) The few who can be counted on one’s fingers must of course meet the Mussalmans.
('80', 219, 7, 22, 350095) They should try to win over as many of them as they can.
('80', 219, 7, 23, 350152) If the Muslim community is bent on fighting, I would not reject the idea of boycott.
('80', 219, 7, 24, 350237) I would consider boycott more decent than stabbing with daggers, burning houses, etc.
('80', 219, 7, 25, 350323) The conclusion to be drawn from this is that we should guide even those who resort to violence as much as we can.
('80', 219, 7, 26, 350437) As I am writing this with my left hand I have been brief.
('80', 219, 7, 27, 350495) Add this to what Mahadev tells you or keep this in mind in whatever you do.
('80', 219, 7, 28, 350571) Mahadev himself will fit it into what he advises.

('80', 221, 10, 17, 352650) SEVAGRAM, May 7, 1941 I have just read an account of the unfortunate riots in Bihar.
('80', 221, 10, 18, 352735) As soon as a wire was received on the 3rd instant by Rajendra Babu from Shri Sachidanand Sinha that a dangerous situation was developing in Bihar, he responded by hastening to Bihar.
('80', 221, 10, 19, 352918) The account of the riots makes painful reading.
('80', 221, 10, 20, 352966) I have studied the various statements regarding them also.
('80', 221, 10, 21, 353025) Rajendra Babu has gone to Bihar to put in the whole of his weight in favour of sanity and peace.
('80', 221, 10, 22, 353122) This is his first wire to me after reaching there:
('80', 221, 11, 23, 353173) Situation improving but still panicky uncertain.
('80', 221, 11, 24, 353222) Mathura Babu 1, Shah Sahib 2
('80', 221, 12, 25, 353251) touring.
('80', 221, 12, 26, 353260) Myself proceeding with volunteers.
('80', 221, 13, 27, 353295) 1 Rajendra Prasad’s Secretary 2 Shah Mohammed Uzair Munimji 3 In his Autobiography Rajendra Prasad writes: “ .
('80', 221, 13, 28, 353406) I decided to go at once to Bihar Sharif.
('80', 221, 13, 29, 353447) Fortunately Abdul Bari arrived in Patna the same day and he consented to accompany me.
('80', 221, 13, 30, 353534) We engaged a couple of motor lorries and with a batch of teachers and students of Bihar Vidyapith and some other workers left for the place.
('80', 222, 0, 1, 353675) VOL. 80 : 28 DECEMBER, 1940 17 AUGUST, 1941 223
('80', 222, 1, 2, 353723) I know that he will give a good account of himself.
('80', 222, 1, 3, 353775) Peace will somehow be restored if it has not been already by the police and the military.
('80', 222, 1, 4, 353865) But this can only be a superimposed peace.
('80', 222, 1, 5, 353908) Rajendra Babu’s as every Congressman’s and for that matter every sane citizen’s business is to find out the cause of the riots.
('80', 222, 1, 6, 354036) Unless this is done, there is no likelihood of permanent peace.
('80', 222, 1, 7, 354100) I observe that the riots started with the resentment over the observance of Anti Pakistan Day 1. Pakistan and anti Pakistan observances and the like have come to stay.
('80', 222, 1, 8, 354268) As national consciousness grows and ambitions rise high, such observances will multiply.
('80', 222, 1, 9, 354357) But why can we not conduct ourselves decently in spite of these?
('80', 222, 1, 10, 354422) Why should we be so utterly intolerant as not to suffer one another’s views?
('80', 222, 1, 11, 354499) And then why should we show our intolerance as if we were savages?
('80', 222, 1, 12, 354566) I am quite convinced that the chief burden for the voluntary preservation of peace lies on the shoulders of the Congress, the oldest, the best organized and the most popular organization in India.
('80', 222, 1, 13, 354763) It must be admitted that the vast majority of Congress members are Hindus and Bihar is a predominantly Hindu province.
('80', 222, 1, 14, 354882) Therefore it should be comparatively easier for the Congress to ensure peace there without the aid of the police and the military.
('80', 222, 1, 15, 355013) It should be a point of honour for the stronger party to protect the weak against harm to life or property.
('80', 222, 1, 16, 355121) It is a difficult task but it has got to be tackled.
('80', 222, 1, 17, 355174) When I lay this burden on the Congress, I do not mean to suggest that the Congress alone should or can do it.
('80', 222, 1, 18, 355284) The Congress has to invoke the assistance of all parties, the Muslim League, the Hindu Mahasabha and others.
('80', 222, 1, 19, 355393) Each may have its political programme.
('80', 222, 1, 20, 355432) But if we are not intent upon imposing our respective programme on the opponents by force of arms, expressed today through goondaism, surely we may all agree that we shall settle all our differences through negotiation and peaceful effort including arbitration.
('80', 222, 1, 21, 355694) The Congress may fail to produce joint action.
('80', 222, 1, 22, 355741) If so, it will be a noble failure.
('80', 222, 1, 23, 355776) It must, however, continue to work even single handed, if its non violence has any meaning in it.
('80', 222, 1, 24, 355874) At present Bihar is the province that can lead the way and set the example.
('80', 222, 1, 25, 355950) Rajendra Babu has a gentle and unique hold in his province such as no other leader has.
('80', 222, 1, 26, 356038) He is the hero of the earthquake 2 days when the whole of India put its trust in him.
('80', 222, 1, 27, 356124) May he have too the privilege of being the messenger of peace in Bihar and through Bihar

('80', 223, 5, 9, 356620) MY DEAR MENON, I had both your letters.
('80', 223, 5, 10, 356660) The first did not call for a reply.
('80', 223, 5, 11, 356696) I note what you say about the meeting.
('80', 223, 5, 12, 356735) As Seth Jamnalalji had a talk with Shri Vaze 1 and as the latter is understood to have undertaken even the editing of the paper 2 I have written to him and am awaiting his reply.
('80', 223, 5, 13, 356914) I would therefore suggest your holding the meeting after I have had the reply.

('80', 226, 6, 9, 360747) I merely gave you advice which you were free to follow or reject.
('80', 226, 6, 10, 360813) Now my firm opinion is that you are wholly unfit for responsible work on your own.
('80', 226, 6, 11, 360896) You have long neglected your domestic duty.
('80', 226, 6, 12, 360940) You will serve the nation by bearing the family burden.
('80', 226, 6, 13, 360996) If you can restrain your sexual appetite, you will create no progeny but do your duty by those for whose creation you are responsible.
('80', 226, 6, 14, 361131) Your worth will be judged by what you are able to do in this direction.
('80', 226, 6, 15, 361203) I shall continue to send money till the end of this month.
('80', 226, 6, 16, 361262) Thence you will bear your own burden.
('80', 226, 6, 17, 361300) Please remember that I was in no way obliged to spend any money on you.
('80', 226, 6, 18, 361372) But thinking that you were a deserving national servant, I spent money on you.
('80', 226, 6, 19, 361451) I shall still try to train Sailen and Dhiren.
('80', 226, 6, 20, 361497) I shall go on for a little time.

('80', 228, 3, 5, 363323) 1 I had been waiting for your reply and so did not write to you yesterday.
('80', 228, 3, 6, 363398) I do hope that Ba is really all right.
('80', 228, 3, 7, 363437) So that is not the reason why I have sent the telegram.
('80', 228, 3, 8, 363493) I feel perturbed that just when you are having your examination you have to be worrying about Ba.
('80', 228, 3, 9, 363591) But I know God will save you.

('80', 228, 3, 15, 363891) Rajkumari and Amtul Salaam were in agreement with the plan.
('80', 228, 3, 16, 363951) Lilavati was not aware of it.
('80', 228, 3, 17, 363981) Even so she slept at some distance.
('80', 228, 3, 18, 364017) She did not even protest when Dr. Das made other suggestions.
('80', 228, 3, 19, 364079) The whole change was with a view to giving me rest.

('80', 231, 8, 13, 367929) If Ba has to come before you do, she must have an escort.
('80', 231, 8, 14, 367987) That is why I am sending Lilavati.
('80', 231, 8, 15, 368022) There is also the wish that while Ba is bed ridden, this will mean less burden for Lakshmi.
('80', 231, 8, 16, 368114) Now Lilavati is going there.
('80', 231, 8, 17, 368143) If she has to stay on there, you will of course be showing her around the college, etc.
('80', 231, 8, 18, 368231) Entrust that job to someone else.
('80', 231, 8, 19, 368265) I do not wish to take your time.
('80', 231, 8, 20, 368298) I am returning the papers you had sent for Pyarelal.
('80', 231, 8, 21, 368351) He does not want them.

('80', 232, 3, 5, 368689) I understand about Ba.
('80', 232, 3, 6, 368712) I feel relieved after sending Lilavati.
('80', 232, 3, 7, 368752) The burden on Lakshmi was hurting me.
('80', 232, 3, 8, 368790) Lilavati will give you all the news from here.
('80', 232, 3, 9, 368837) It is really strange about your examination.
('80', 232, 3, 10, 368882) What kind of a university is it that cannot fix even the dates till the very last moment?
('80', 232, 3, 11, 368972) What can you gain out of it?
('80', 232, 3, 12, 369001) Be that as it may, you have to go through the ordeal.
('80', 232, 3, 13, 369055) I shall await your arrival on the 2nd or 3rd of June.

('80', 232, 8, 21, 369341) 1 Evidently you did not attend to what I said.
('80', 232, 8, 22, 369388) I told you, you were not to use my name about anything you did.
('80', 232, 8, 23, 369452) You were sent because Vina and Abha had to go and for that matter even Sailen and Dhiren had to go.
('80', 232, 8, 24, 369552) I did advise you to go toDacca but not as my agent or messenger, You needed no introduction.
('80', 232, 8, 25, 369645) You know that I have no confidence in your judgment.
('80', 232, 8, 26, 369698) I merely suggested what you might do, if you cut yourself from your family.
('80', 232, 8, 27, 369774) But I must not labour the point.
('80', 232, 8, 28, 369807) If you will let friends know that you were acting under an obvious misunderstanding and that you were in no way my representative it would be enough.
('80', 232, 8, 29, 369957) My Dacca wire stands.
('80', 232, 8, 30, 369979) If you work in the limelight you will fail.

('80', 233, 1, 3, 370402) If they do not you must go to the family and attend to that primary duty.
('80', 233, 1, 4, 370476) I shall not be responsible for your expenses after May for which month I now understand you have already taken the money in advance.
('80', 233, 1, 5, 370609) I was sorry to hear that you had taken away the things you had got from others as for instance the blanket from Chimanlal.

('80', 233, 6, 13, 370954) You are worrying too much about Durgabehn.
('80', 233, 6, 14, 370997) She sleeps more than enough.
('80', 233, 6, 15, 371026) The pain in the thigh is gradually subsiding.
('80', 233, 6, 16, 371072) She is taking salicylate and occasionally Epsom salts too.
('80', 233, 6, 17, 371131) Urine, etc., are normal.
('80', 233, 6, 18, 371156) She can sit up by herself.
('80', 233, 6, 19, 371183) She comes down at will from the raised platform in the open with somebody’s help.
('80', 233, 6, 20, 371265) In spite of this evident daily improvement, do you still want her to be admitted to the hospital?
('80', 233, 6, 21, 371363) What do you suspect?
('80', 233, 6, 22, 371384) She eats thin khakharis, bhaji, fruit, etc.

('80', 234, 2, 4, 371772) DEVDAS, I got your letter today at 11.40 along with the other letters.
('80', 234, 2, 5, 371843) You have written Friday in your letter.
('80', 234, 2, 6, 371883) Today is Saturday.
('80', 234, 2, 7, 371902) A letter written on Friday cannot reach here on Saturday at 11 o’clock.
('80', 234, 2, 8, 371974) The date on the envelope is also that of Thursday.
('80', 234, 2, 9, 372025) It seems I must now stop issuing statements to the Associated Press.
('80', 234, 2, 10, 372094) The U[nited] P[ress of India] has stopped on its own.
('80', 234, 2, 11, 372148) Several papers have published my statement 1 in full.
('80', 234, 2, 12, 372202) You fought quite well.
('80', 234, 2, 13, 372225) But I think by and by even that will not be possible.
('80', 234, 2, 14, 372279) Or you people will have to.
('80', 234, 2, 15, 372307) 2 I see that you have published my statement minus the portions censored.
('80', 234, 2, 16, 372381) 3 This was not right.
('80', 234, 2, 17, 372403) It would have been much better if you had not published the statement at all.
('80', 234, 2, 18, 372481) In any case you should have said “censored” at places where some portions are omitted.
('80', 234, 2, 19, 372568) The Hindustan Times will come out poor in comparison with other papers.
('80', 234, 2, 20, 372640) It wouldn’t have mattered if such an impression had no foundation in fact.
('80', 234, 2, 21, 372715) But here it will be well founded.
('80', 234, 2, 22, 372749) But what is done is done.
('80', 234, 2, 23, 372775) Henceforth I should like my statements to be published in full, if they are to be published at all.
('80', 234, 2, 24, 372875) I was glad to learn that you found Ba in good health.
('80', 234, 2, 25, 372929) I had no doubt at all about Lakshmi’s capacity for service.
('80', 234, 2, 26, 372989) All the same, I have sent Lilavati to lighten her burden.
('80', 234, 2, 27, 373047) It seems now that Ba will not return before June.
('80', 234, 2, 28, 373097) Mahadev will be here on the 13th.

('80', 235, 1, 3, 373746) I got it yesterday and could read it only late at night.
('80', 235, 1, 4, 373803) How can I share your belief that, had I been in Ahmedabad, the riots would not have taken place?
('80', 235, 1, 5, 373900) It is difficult to make such a statement about anybody today.
('80', 235, 1, 6, 373962) I follow where God leads me.
('80', 235, 1, 7, 373991) He has brought me and kept me here.
('80', 235, 1, 8, 374027) I know there are many villages like this one in Gujarat and I could have settled in one of them.

('80', 235, 1, 15, 374331) Yesterday I sent Lilavati to Delhi.
('80', 235, 1, 16, 374367) Janakibehn’s 2 health is very good indeed.
('80', 235, 1, 17, 374410) Why did Nandubehn say it was bad?
('80', 235, 1, 18, 374444) These days she is taking long walks as she never used to do before.
('80', 235, 1, 19, 374512) And she eats well.
('80', 235, 1, 20, 374531) Kanu’s betrothal has been put off for the present.
('80', 235, 1, 21, 374582) It may be assumed that it is not coming off in the immediate future.

('80', 235, 2, 23, 374662) also has gone home to her parents.

('80', 239, 8, 19, 379067) We should work according to our lights.

('80', 240, 6, 10, 380245) If you are as slovenly in your work as you are in writing to me, you will fail.
('80', 240, 6, 11, 380325) Janaki Devi is in Nagpur at Shri Mehta’s.

('80', 240, 10, 25, 380802) Why do you worry?
('80', 240, 10, 26, 380820) Whatever is to happen will happen.

('80', 241, 3, 4, 381463) SUSHILA, I have your perfect letter.
('80', 241, 3, 5, 381500) The letter from Devdas scared me so much that I sent a telegram leaving it all to you.
('80', 241, 3, 6, 381587) Even though I had not asked for a telegraphic reply, I did expect one.
('80', 241, 3, 7, 381658) But now it is an old story.
('80', 241, 3, 8, 381686) Now you alone will bring Ba.
('80', 241, 3, 9, 381715) But what about your examination?
('80', 241, 3, 10, 381748) What utter chaos!
('80', 241, 3, 11, 381766) I have not seen such a thing anywhere.
('80', 241, 3, 12, 381805) On what basis did Lazarus say that the examination would be held on the 12th?
('80', 241, 3, 13, 381883) Even if the examination is not held this month, will you be able to ask for long leave in June?
('80', 241, 3, 14, 381979) Tell Lilavati that I have received her letter.
('80', 241, 3, 15, 382026) Coax her to study.
('80', 241, 3, 16, 382045) I do not like that she should lose three months without study.
('80', 241, 3, 17, 382108) Jamnalalji has fallen ill.
('80', 241, 3, 18, 382135) I have sent Das.

('80', 241, 8, 28, 382481) About the guests, what you say is correct.
('80', 241, 8, 29, 382524) You are also correct regarding kitchen cleanliness, etc.
('80', 241, 8, 30, 382581) If you have to incur some out of the way expense the Committee should be consulted.
('80', 241, 8, 31, 382665) The expenses will be debited to the accounts falling within your sphere.
('80', 241, 8, 32, 382738) These will be endorsed by you.
('80', 241, 8, 33, 382769) But the manager can endorse them only in your absence.

('80', 241, 8, 35, 382897) The same people can work in other departments also.
('80', 241, 8, 36, 382949) You should arrange for this with the head of the other department.

('80', 242, 1, 3, 383123) Whatever authority we need to discharge it will come by itself.
('80', 242, 1, 4, 383187) This has been my experience throughout the last fifty years.
('80', 242, 1, 5, 383248) You will have to arrange your work in such a way that a definite time is kept for supervising cleanliness.
('80', 242, 1, 6, 383355) At that time you should have a small bucket, a shovel and a broomstick.
('80', 242, 1, 7, 383427) The regular work would be done by others.
('80', 242, 1, 8, 383469) But whatever faults you come across at the time of inspection you will yourself do as best as you can and draw the attention of the persons concerned.
('80', 242, 1, 9, 383620) You will not try to do the bulk of the work yourself, and whatever you can conveniently do, you will not allot to others.

('80', 242, 6, 18, 384070) The thing is that the world is inseparable from me.
('80', 242, 6, 19, 384122) There are more Bhansalis than one.
('80', 242, 6, 20, 384157) They all do not behave so handsomely as he 3 does.

('80', 242, 6, 22, 384228) You have not gone deeper into the thing.
('80', 242, 6, 23, 384269) It is not the kitchen that is worrying me.
('80', 242, 6, 24, 384312) The growth has been spontaneous and the destruction or the reshaping will have to be likewise.
('80', 242, 6, 25, 384407) I can only help the process.
('80', 242, 6, 26, 384436) Everywhere I have been overwhelmed.
('80', 242, 6, 27, 384472) The Rajkot home gave place to the Bombay home.
('80', 242, 6, 28, 384519) That to the Natal Home, the latter again to Bombay, then two in Johannesburg, then Phoenix, Tolstoy Farm, back to Phoenix, then Kochrab, Sabarmati, Maganwadi and Sevagram.
('80', 242, 6, 29, 384691) I have omitted the intermediate shifts.

('80', 243, 4, 12, 385396) MY DEAR ‘SLAVE’, ‘Handsome is that handsome does’.
('80', 243, 4, 13, 385447) J. H. has gone by the appearance of the exterior.
('80', 243, 4, 14, 385497) The imposing case was nonsense.
('80', 243, 4, 15, 385529) Remove the nonsense and the bare dhanush takli is the cheapest and the most efficient thing going.
('80', 243, 4, 16, 385628) It is cheaper than the original takli.
('80', 243, 4, 17, 385667) It cannot easily go out of order and is so incredibly simple that the spinner can adjust it, not so the vertical wheel or the horizontal.
('80', 243, 4, 18, 385805) I touch no other.
('80', 243, 4, 19, 385823) After having said this, let me admitthat the solid charkha has its special merits.
('80', 243, 4, 20, 385906) But putting all things together, the dhanush takli I consider the best.
('80', 243, 4, 21, 385978) 1 You will pass on this to J.H. These riots are a wicked thing.

('80', 245, 2, 3, 387760) May 13, 1941
('80', 245, 3, 4, 387773) KISHORELAL, I had carefully preserved the draft of Satyagraha Sathi 1 which you had prepared on August 9, 1940. I had resolved to find time to go through it.
('80', 245, 3, 5, 387931) I fulfilled my resolve today, if only to respect your enthusiasm and selfless labour.
('80', 245, 3, 6, 388017) I have experienced such disappointments regarding the Ashram that I have lost all interest in embarking on new ventures.
('80', 245, 3, 7, 388138) I do wish that some of you should set up a brotherhood during, or even after, my lifetime.
('80', 245, 3, 8, 388229) Let it be just a few in the beginning.
('80', 245, 3, 9, 388268) The supplement is useful.
('80', 245, 3, 10, 388294) It gives good guidance.
('80', 245, 3, 11, 388318) It can be touched up and published even now.
('80', 245, 3, 12, 388363) I have deleted two clauses on page 6. I did not think it necessary to list the different types of violence as they are countless.
('80', 245, 3, 13, 388493) Moreover, the ones you have cited are superficial examples.
('80', 245, 3, 14, 388553) Violence lies latent in our hearts.
('80', 245, 3, 15, 388589) If in my curs cursory revision I have spoiled the draft, please make necessary corrections.
('80', 245, 3, 16, 388681) You will understand what I mean by the cross on page 10. Appendix C becomes superfluous for the present.

('80', 245, 8, 22, 388973) Those who want to serve should learn the art of keeping healthy.

('80', 246, 13, 19, 389958) MUNNALAL, Your letter makes strange reading.
('80', 246, 13, 20, 390003) It shows the limit of mental confusion.
('80', 246, 13, 21, 390043) You asked for one hundred rupees, and the sum was immediately sent.
('80', 246, 13, 22, 390111) You now return it and say that if, after considering all the factors, Kanchan and I feel convinced and are fully satisfied, the money may be sent back to you !
('80', 246, 13, 23, 390271) What is all this?
('80', 246, 13, 24, 390289) You could have asked us whether or not we were satisfied.

('80', 247, 1, 2, 390389) After reading it, I am sending your terrible letter to Kanchan.
('80', 247, 1, 3, 390453) You are not coming.
('80', 247, 1, 4, 390473) If now I send her, you are prepared to have her.
('80', 247, 1, 5, 390522) What is this?
('80', 247, 1, 6, 390536) You have no consideration for her feelings nor for mine.
('80', 247, 1, 7, 390593) If you were not to come or could not come, it was understood that Kanchan would stay there.
('80', 247, 1, 8, 390685) She could have stayed.
('80', 247, 1, 9, 390708) You sent her back as soon as she arrived.
('80', 247, 1, 10, 390750) What is this?
('80', 247, 1, 11, 390764) Your heart is not there, and still you are staying on.
('80', 247, 1, 12, 390819) You have not got adjusted to everything there and are still obstinately clinging on.
('80', 247, 1, 13, 390904) This is not right.
('80', 247, 1, 14, 390923) I have not told anyone that you are hiding any fact or thought from me.
('80', 247, 1, 15, 390995) That you do not want to come to Sevagram, I learnt only from your letter.
('80', 247, 1, 16, 391069) My advice is this: Ask for the hundred rupees whenever you need it.
('80', 247, 1, 17, 391137) If you are not interested in appearing for the examination or if your health is not good, come over here and then go to some cool place.
('80', 247, 1, 18, 391274) If you wish, you can go to Bordi.
('80', 247, 1, 19, 391308) If you come here, we can have a quiet talk and decide what you should do.
('80', 247, 1, 20, 391382) I do not agree with you that I have paid no attention to your problems.

('80', 248, 7, 9, 392468) DEAR SARANGADHAR DAS , I was delighted to read your very interesting letter to Rajkumari.
('80', 248, 7, 10, 392558) Yes, I remember having received your statement.
('80', 248, 7, 11, 392606) I can remember nothing that jarred on my ears.
('80', 248, 7, 12, 392653) Rajkumari was then in the Punjab.
('80', 248, 7, 13, 392687) I am glad you came in such close contact with Harijans.
('80', 248, 7, 14, 392743) ‘C’ class is undoubtedly best.
('80', 248, 7, 15, 392774) ‘‘A” and “B” are [an] eternal sore.
('80', 248, 7, 16, 392810) It is of our making.
('80', 248, 7, 17, 392831) I hope you are none the worse for your experience.
('80', 248, 7, 18, 392882) I know there is trouble outside.
('80', 248, 7, 19, 392915) Rajen Babu cannot leave Bihar for the present.
('80', 248, 7, 20, 392962) As I have already told Padhiary 4 we have all to learn the art of solving our own difficulties.

('80', 249, 1, 2, 393622) 440. “KHADI JAGAT” 1
('80', 249, 2, 3, 393643) The sphere of Khadi Jagat is co extensive with that of the activities of the All India Spinners’ Association.
('80', 249, 2, 4, 393753) Theoretically speaking, the activities of the A. I. S. A. are unlimited.
('80', 249, 2, 5, 393826) At present it provides employment to 2,24,421 spinners, of whom 1,67,996 are Hindus and 56,425 are Muslims, along with 20,643 other artisans, such as ginners, carders, dyers, weavers and washermen.
('80', 249, 2, 6, 394024) The A. I. S. A. represents all those Hindus, Mussalmans, and others who are engaged in the various processes involved in the production of khadi, as also those who use khadi.
('80', 249, 2, 7, 394199) Although these people are at present a mere drop in the ocean of Indian humanity, they are numerous enough to be scattered throughout the length and breadth of the country.
('80', 249, 2, 8, 394372) The A. I S. A. is entirely a philanthropic institution.
('80', 249, 2, 9, 394428) It is the largest institution of its kind in India and perhaps in the world.
('80', 249, 2, 10, 394505) If the expectations formed about this institution materialize, the A. I. S. A. should represent the whole of the dumb and semi starved millions of India.
('80', 249, 2, 11, 394659) And if that event comes about, it would represent the aspirations of the whole of the submerged world.
('80', 249, 2, 12, 394762) The bloody massacre going on in the present war is probably a demonstration of the fact that industrialism will lead the world to destruction in the end.
('80', 249, 2, 13, 394916) Enlightened revival of handicrafts alone can save it.
('80', 249, 2, 14, 394970) But here I am talking of the future and God alone knows what the future has in store for us.
('80', 249, 2, 15, 395063) All the same there is such a thing in the world as human endeavour, and the endeavour of the A. I. S. A. is to propagate the spirit of khadi throughout India.
('80', 249, 2, 16, 395222) Then alone can we get rid of the grinding pauperism of India’s masses.
('80', 249, 2, 17, 395293) The word ‘khadi’ must be taken in its wider sense here.
('80', 249, 2, 18, 395349) For such extensive work, we require a much greater number of workers than have been hitherto available.
('80', 249, 2, 19, 395453) Those who are already engaged in this work have to cultivate greater capacity for sacrifice.
('80', 249, 2, 20, 395546) They must cultivate the habit of studying in a scientific spirit.
('80', 249, 2, 21, 395612) Their knowledge must be steadily progressive.
('80', 249, 2, 22, 395658) The wheel is the centre of this activity because it alone can give employment and living to the millions of women.
('80', 249, 2, 23, 395773) The wheel includes the takli.
('80', 249, 2, 24, 395803) It is not to be taken merely as the widow’smainstay.
('80', 249, 2, 25, 395856) It has been conceived as a symbol of India’s economic uplift,
('80', 249, 3, 26, 395918) 1 This appeared in the inaugural issue of Khadi Jagat, a Hindi monthly published by the A.I.S.A. from Wardha.
('80', 250, 0, 1, 396028) VOL. 80 : 28 DECEMBER, 1940 17 AUGUST, 1941 251
('80', 250, 1, 2, 396076) Hindu Muslim unity and therefore even of her independence in terms of her millions.
('80', 250, 1, 3, 396160) Thus the science of khadi is a lofty study.
('80', 250, 1, 4, 396204) Many experts are required to dedicate their energies in an organized manner for the furtherance of the cause.
('80', 250, 1, 5, 396314) These include economists as well as highly skilled mechanics.
('80', 250, 1, 6, 396376) A mason can build a village house, but it requires an engineer to plan and build a big building or a big dam.
('80', 250, 1, 7, 396486) Much more talent, knowledge, application and research are required to improve the village implements than to build a bridge on the Ganga.
('80', 250, 1, 8, 396624) When we are able to attract people of this type by our renunciation and methodical research, we will be able to make rapid far reaching progress, not till then.
('80', 250, 1, 9, 396785) Looking at it from this point of view, Khadi Jagat is not an insignificant venture.
('80', 250, 1, 10, 396869) It was because I regarded it as an ambitious venture that I supported the proposition of undertaking it.
('80', 250, 1, 11, 396974) I hope, therefore, that all the articles published in this magazine will be of the required standard and be earnestly studied by the A. I. S. A. workers and those interested in the uplift of the villages.
('80', 250, 1, 12, 397179) To carry on the activities of the A. I. S. A. we require workers as well as money.
('80', 250, 1, 13, 397262) The responsibility of getting both rests upon the Present khadi workers.
('80', 250, 1, 14, 397335) I think it will be well for me as the President of the A. I. S. A. at this stage to make a confession.
('80', 250, 1, 15, 397438) The Association has suffered a loss of over two lacs because of my and a co worker’s, call it carelessness, or overtrustfulness.
('80', 250, 1, 16, 397567) Thinking him to be a good man, Shankerlal Banker took a certain person on the A. I. S. A. staff.
('80', 250, 1, 17, 397664) He overtrusted this man and did not supervise his work as he ought to have.
('80', 250, 1, 18, 397740) His failing health was partly responsible for this.
('80', 250, 1, 19, 397792) Though the auditing of accounts was done regularly, this man very cunningly succeeded in outwitting everybody and misappropriating over two lacs of rupees.
('80', 250, 1, 20, 397948) This was detected when Shri Jajuji took charge of A. I. S. A. offlce.
('80', 250, 1, 21, 398018) The delinquent has confessed his guilt, though we have not succeeded in getting back the money as yet.
('80', 250, 1, 22, 398121) We are still trying for it.
('80', 250, 1, 23, 398149) The Sangh is following its traditional policy of avoiding the law courts as far as possible, but if it becomes necessary, there will be no hesitation in going to the courts.
('80', 250, 1, 24, 398323) The object of mentioning this incident here is to let the helpers of the A. I. S. A. learn of our carelessness and forgive us if possible.
('80', 250, 1, 25, 398462) I make the confession also in order that we may become more vigilant.
('80', 250, 1, 26, 398532) It is also hoped that as a result of this confession, workers of the A. I. S. A. all over the country will realize their responsibility and know that every pice mis 
('80', 251, 0, 1, 398698) 252 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 251, 1, 2, 398740) appropriated is so much taken out of the mouths of the poor.
('80', 251, 1, 3, 398801) It will be well if it can also awaken the guilty person to a sense of his duty.
('80', 251, 1, 4, 398881) It will comfort Shri Shankerlal Banker who in his simplicity had put too much trust in this man.
('80', 251, 1, 5, 398978) One thing I must not omit.
('80', 251, 1, 6, 399005) The Association has increased the wages of the spinners without any demand from the spinners themselves and completely ignoring the market wages.
('80', 251, 1, 7, 399151) This will be always looked upon as a creditable adventure for the A. I. S. A. The khadi lovers have helped the Association in this philanthropic move.
('80', 251, 1, 8, 399302) The price of khadi was bound to go up, but these friends willingly paid the extra price.
('80', 251, 1, 9, 399391) Consequently, khadi workers have a double duty to discharge.
('80', 251, 1, 10, 399452) They must see that in the first place the spinners get the full wages according to the standard laid down by the A. I. S. A. Secondly the customer buying khadi should be charged the minimum price compatible with the rise in the wages.
('80', 251, 1, 11, 399687) There should be no attempt at making profit.
('80', 251, 1, 12, 399732) If at some place profits have accrued they should be spent with the permission of the A. I. S. A. in lowering the price of khadi or otherwise in the interest of the poor.
('80', 251, 1, 13, 399903) The progress of khadi does not depend upon the ups and downs of the market.
('80', 251, 1, 14, 399979) It depends upon the purity of our transactions.
('80', 251, 1, 15, 400027) If our transactions are pure they must result in at least three things.
('80', 251, 1, 16, 400099) 1. We will attract spinners and artisans.
('80', 251, 1, 17, 400141) 2. The number of khadi wearers will increase and the necessary money will flow in, and 3. Greater number of workers will be attracted.
('80', 251, 1, 18, 400276) I say this on the strength of 55 years of public service.
('80', 251, 1, 19, 400334) It will be the endeavour of the Khadi Jagat to achieve the three ends or in other words Khadi Jagat will strive to induce in the workers an ambition for greater purity, greater dedication and greater knowledge.

('80', 252, 7, 14, 401059) May 15, 1941
('80', 252, 8, 15, 401072) Q. Very few names from the third list of satyagrahis from Maharashtra (193 out of 1,072) are approved and permitted to offer satyagraha.
('80', 252, 8, 16, 401209) This permissionbusiness seems to be unduly delayed, and the satyagrahis are thus put to much inconvenience.
('80', 252, 9, 17, 401317) A. I propose to introduce a change in the technique about the passing of these lists of satyagrahis.
('80', 252, 9, 18, 401418) 2 From the date on which the name of a prospective satyagrahi is forwarded to me for sanction by the Provincial Congress Committee the satyagrahi concerned has to stop his private activities and has to devote himself wholly to the working out of one or more of the items of the thirteenfold constructive programme, which expression is to be understood in the widest sense as explained in my article 3 headed ‘‘Implications of Constructive
('80', 252, 10, 19, 401857) 1 President, Maharashtra Provincial Congress Committee, who was accom panied by Dr. Lagu of Poona.
('80', 252, 10, 20, 401956) According to the source, this was ‘‘revised and corrected by Gandhiji” and was released to the Press with his permission.

('80', 253, 0, 1, 402365) 254 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 253, 1, 2, 402407) Programme” in the issue of Harijan dated 18th of August 1940. Every prospective satyagrahi is expected to keep a log book (or diary) in which he will daily enter the work done during the course of the day and the log book shall be submitted to me through the P.C.C. concerned at stated intervals, say, fortnightly or monthly.
('80', 253, 1, 3, 402733) After going through the diaries I shall grant permission for satyagraha to deserv ing persons.
('80', 253, 1, 4, 402828) Others will have to follow the said course till they get permission.
('80', 253, 1, 5, 402897) The satyagrahi may not expect any financial help from the Congress.
('80', 253, 1, 6, 402965) I know that on this very strict basis the number of satyagrahis will be reduced to a very large extent but what I am keen on is quality and not quantity.
('80', 253, 1, 7, 403119) I shall not feel sorry if the number is reduced to any extent.
('80', 253, 1, 8, 403182) Moreover, whilst so many satyagrahis are wandering about, I am anxious not to add to the list of wanderers.
('80', 253, 2, 9, 403290) Don”t you feel that you are unfair to the prospective satyagrahis in prescribing such a severe preliminary test to them only, while you allowed their predecessors in on a comparatively simpler test?
('80', 253, 3, 10, 403489) I don’t think I am unfair.
('80', 253, 3, 11, 403516) One thing that you must remember is that the above movement is evolving.
('80', 253, 3, 12, 403589) Exigencies of the situation may demand varying conditions.
('80', 253, 4, 13, 403648) Has the President of the P.C.C. any duty towards the satyagrahis when they come out of jail?
('80', 253, 4, 14, 403741) Yes, he certainly has.
('80', 253, 4, 15, 403764) He has to ask them to repeat satyagraha and find themselves again in jail, say, within about a week from the date of their release.
('80', 253, 4, 16, 403896) The P.C.C.s.
('80', 253, 4, 17, 403909) need only report to me cases demanding special treatment and the instructions that will be issued by me in these cases should be followed and executed by the P.C.C.s.
('80', 253, 5, 18, 404076) How long will this process go on?
('80', 253, 5, 19, 404110) Indefinitely; that is to say, till we achieve our goal.
('80', 253, 5, 20, 404166) Deep down in me there is a feeling that the struggle will become progressively fiercer, and we must pass through all such trials.
('80', 253, 5, 21, 404296) In this respect we must take lesson from the British who, in spite of all the severe losses and heavy odds against them, have maintained fine morale and are determined to carry on.
('80', 253, 5, 22, 404477) We may not do less.
('80', 253, 6, 23, 404497) 1 This and the following three paragraphs are reproduced from Congress Bulletin.
('80', 254, 0, 1, 404578) VOL. 80 : 28 DECEMBER, 1940 17 AUGUST, 1941 255
('80', 254, 1, 2, 404626) If any satyagrahi who has enrolled himself on the original basis feels unable to accept the new basis, which will be the honourable way out for him ?
('80', 254, 2, 3, 404776) He is free to withdraw his name and there is no disgrace attaching to any such honest withdrawal.
('80', 254, 2, 4, 404874) I must not be deceived.
('80', 254, 2, 5, 404898) To deceive me is to deceive oneself and the nation.
('80', 254, 2, 6, 404950) Every honest person can and should withdraw his name.
('80', 254, 2, 7, 405004) He may continue to render whatever services he can to the country.
('80', 254, 2, 8, 405071) He does remain and does continue a Congressman as before.
('80', 254, 2, 9, 405129) Congress does require and does appreciate his services also.
('80', 254, 2, 10, 405190) But he cannot remain on the satyagrahi list as it is now envisaged.
('80', 254, 3, 11, 405258) Can we start and develop a volunteer organization under the present circumstances ?
('80', 254, 3, 12, 405342) By all means; the only condition is that it shall be organized only on the basis of non violence—unadulterated non violence.
('80', 254, 3, 13, 405467) No trifling with non violence will do and therefore no laxity in that respect can be tolerated.
('80', 254, 3, 14, 405563) One more point.
('80', 254, 3, 15, 405579) The said organization should be pro Congress and yet independent of the Congress.
('80', 254, 3, 16, 405661) It can be an allied institution like A.I.S.A., etc.
('80', 254, 4, 17, 405713) Can decent violence in self defence under emergencies by any member of such volunteer organization be tolerated as an exception?
('80', 254, 4, 18, 405842) No, it cannot be.
('80', 254, 4, 19, 405860) No such exception can be contemplated or provided against in advance, in an organization which is started specifically on the sole basis of non violence.
('80', 254, 4, 20, 406014) Such a person will have to leave the organization.
('80', 254, 5, 21, 406065) Non violent resistance is the best method; failing that, even violent decent resistance is tolerable but cowardice is unthinkable and condemnable”.
('80', 254, 5, 22, 406213) That is what you have been preaching in this respect.
('80', 254, 5, 23, 406267) But what you now say does not square with your above dictum.
('80', 254, 5, 24, 406328) That dictum is meant for those millions that have not yet accepted the creed of the Congress.
('80', 254, 5, 25, 406422) It cannot apply to those organiza tions that are founded on the basic creed of non violence.
('80', 254, 5, 26, 406515) Those who desire to effect a change in the basic creed of non violence must either change their General or go out of the organization.
('80', 254, 6, 27, 406650) The Congress being largely suspended as an organization, what should be our policy this year as regards the annual enrolment of membership?
('80', 254, 7, 28, 406790) 1 This and the following paragraph are reproduced from Congress Bulletin.
('80', 254, 7, 29, 406864) 2 This and the following three paragraphs are reproduced from Congress Bulletin.
('80', 255, 0, 1, 406945) 256 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 255, 1, 2, 406987) Under the circumstances there can be no obligation to enrol membership in the usual manner.
('80', 255, 1, 3, 407079) New applicants, if they so desire, must however be enrolled as members and there should be no objection to realizing annual subscriptions from old members wherever practicable.
('80', 255, 2, 4, 407256) Do you desire the starting of peace brigades?
('80', 255, 2, 5, 407302) Certainly I do.
('80', 255, 2, 6, 407318) Some time ago (vide Harijan 18th June, 1938) I made certain concrete suggestions 1 in that respect.
('80', 255, 2, 7, 407418) I know very few will be found, at least in the beginning, to enlist in such an organiza tion.
('80', 255, 2, 8, 407512) A beginning may however be made by any small number or even singly.
('80', 255, 2, 9, 407580) Such an organization cannot be conducted on the lines of democracy.
('80', 255, 2, 10, 407648) It can only be a body of persons with a definite purpose.
('80', 255, 2, 11, 407706) If the pioneers are the right sort of people they may gather followers in due course.
('80', 255, 3, 12, 407792) What should be our attitude towards elections to local bodies?
('80', 255, 3, 13, 407855) As a rule, elections to such bodies should not be run in the name of the Congress.
('80', 255, 3, 14, 407938) There may be no objection to Congressmen fighting the same on their individual responsibility.
('80', 255, 3, 15, 408033) But this is a question which can be authoritatively decided only by Rajendra Babu and Acharya Kripalani 2.
('80', 255, 4, 16, 408140) Can enrolled satyagrahis fight such elections individually?
('80', 255, 4, 17, 408200) I am quite clear on this point.
('80', 255, 5, 18, 408232) What should be done in the case of those satyagrahis who have already put in their candidature for such elections?
('80', 255, 5, 19, 408347) They have either to withdraw from the election or from the satyagraha pledge 3; they cannot retain both.
('80', 255, 6, 20, 408452) What should be the Congress attitude towards the registration of voters to the Legislatures—both central and provincial?
('80', 255, 6, 21, 408573) The Congress must pay full attention to this work.
('80', 255, 6, 22, 408624) Congress may not ignore it.

('80', 256, 8, 15, 409622) 3 I have also told you that I shall be no longer responsible for your expenses.
('80', 256, 8, 16, 409702) It is no use your returning to Sevagram.
('80', 256, 8, 17, 409743) If no public body will have you or pay for your keep, you should quietly settle down and earn your livelihood and reconstruct your broken home.

('80', 258, 12, 20, 412986) I have not written to you as I promised.
('80', 258, 12, 21, 413027) As a matter of fact I discovered that I did not want to say anything beyond what I said in my letter to Guha 2 and what he has published.
('80', 258, 12, 22, 413165) It is not enough that we give relief.
('80', 258, 12, 23, 413203) That work many can do and are doing, But who can give courage to those who are frightened and who can avoid hatred in spite of things happening which must generate hatred?

('80', 259, 2, 6, 413851) Since his daughters had to be sent away to Bengal and since I had no particular use for him I asked him to return to Bengal and advised him if he wished to go to Dacca and immolate himself as a silent worker without fuss and without in any way using my name.
('80', 259, 2, 7, 414110) Instead he has appeared in the limelight as a star of the first magnitude.
('80', 259, 2, 8, 414185) It has pained me much.
('80', 259, 2, 9, 414208) If I can, I want to avoid having to repudiate him publicly.
('80', 259, 2, 10, 414268) Please talk to him if you think it worth while and wean him from his vanity and falsity.
('80', 259, 2, 11, 414357) In any case warn those who should be warned.
('80', 259, 2, 12, 414402) Do you know anything of his work in Dacca?

('80', 259, 7, 20, 414636) Mahadevbhai went and met Pyarelal today.
('80', 259, 7, 21, 414677) He is all right, but he is almost observing silence.
('80', 259, 7, 22, 414730) The gland in the neck is of course visible.
('80', 259, 7, 23, 414774) He does not write any letters at all.

('80', 260, 3, 5, 415373) I do not even remember if anybody told me anything against you.
('80', 260, 3, 6, 415437) If it had been so I would have at least told you about it.
('80', 260, 3, 7, 415496) Remember the three monkeys.
('80', 260, 3, 8, 415524) Do not lend your ears to such idle talk.
('80', 260, 3, 9, 415565) Tell yourself ‘If there is any complaint Bapu would tell me’ and ignore the complainants.

('80', 261, 1, 4, 416526) Asking me questions, piecemeal, will not help.

('80', 261, 5, 11, 416834) May 18, 1941
('80', 261, 6, 12, 416847) BAPA, You did very well in going to Garhwal.
('80', 261, 6, 13, 416892) It will do you good.
('80', 261, 6, 14, 416913) I think the climate and water of that place are good.
('80', 261, 6, 15, 416967) Jainarayan came and saw me.
('80', 261, 6, 16, 416995) I accepted Vaze’s suggestion and so I told him to go to you and do nothing else.
('80', 261, 6, 17, 417076) I have already communicated my view to you, namely, that the Standing Committee stands suspended and during the struggle the Emergency Committee should function.
('80', 261, 6, 18, 417238) I certainly should not like the whole organization to remain under Amritlal Sheth’s 2 control.
('80', 261, 6, 19, 417333) I do not even like that the paper should run with his money.
('80', 261, 6, 20, 417394) Jainarayan thinks that the Emergency Committee was a private body.
('80', 261, 6, 21, 417461) There was no report about it in the papers nor is it likely to do any work.
('80', 261, 6, 22, 417537) It is the Standing Committee which must have the sole authority.
('80', 261, 6, 23, 417602) I had asked Jamnalalji.
('80', 261, 6, 24, 417626) He says that the Emergency Committee was formed with the consent of Jainarayanji and others, and, therefore, the Standing Committee remains suspended at present.
('80', 261, 6, 25, 417788) It was Balwantrai, and not J., who was keen on the States’ People’s [Conference].
('80', 261, 6, 26, 417870) Jawaharlal has conveyed to Menon that he should abide by my advice.
('80', 261, 6, 27, 417938) That is why I have taken interest in the matter.
('80', 261, 6, 28, 417987) My opinion is as above.
('80', 261, 6, 29, 418011) If you also agree with it there will be no need for you to come.
('80', 261, 6, 30, 418076) If you differ, however, then it is desirable that you should come here.
('80', 261, 6, 31, 418148) I think there will be no difficulty if the States’ People’s [Conference] is run independently.

('80', 262, 1, 4, 418430) I would certainly like your coming here.
('80', 262, 1, 5, 418471) If you feel that anybody else should be present, you may arrange accordingly.
('80', 262, 1, 6, 418549) Do you find it difficult to decipher my handwriting?
('80', 262, 1, 7, 418602) I ask the question this time because I have had to write a rather long letter.
('80', 262, 2, 8, 418681) BAPU [PS.] After writing the above I got your letter full of joy.

('80', 262, 12, 32, 419603) Injustice arises only when one is deprived of a right.
('80', 262, 12, 33, 419658) To go to jail can only be a duty, but never a right.

('80', 264, 8, 24, 422175) If this is correct, the plea for pardon is meaningless.

('80', 266, 5, 11, 424143) [On or before May 21, 1941] 2
('80', 266, 6, 12, 424173) For four days, Mridulabehn, Gulzarilal and I have had talks to our hearts’ content.
('80', 266, 6, 13, 424257) If you and Sjt.
('80', 266, 6, 14, 424273) Jivanlal Divan could have been also present, it would have been very helpful to me in arriving at a decision.
('80', 266, 6, 15, 424383) I gather that there are two opinions regarding what the Congress did, failed to do, and should do in future in case of communal disturbances.
('80', 266, 6, 16, 424525) However that may be, everything considered, I am of opinion that, in a crisis like the present, an Advisory Committee (of which the personnel is given below) should be appointed, and everything should be done according to their advice.
('80', 266, 6, 17, 424761) You will see that I have included Shri Mahadev Desai’s name on the Committee.
('80', 266, 6, 18, 424839) He will not be able to be there on all occasions, but he will try to be there whenever you all feel that his presence is essential.
('80', 266, 6, 19, 424971) Your first duty is to find out how many among our Congressmen firmly hold that violent resistance against an opponent in defence of oneself or others is out of the question.
('80', 266, 6, 20, 425145) Those who favour violent resistance must get out of the Congress and shape their conduct just as they think fit and guide others accordingly.
('80', 266, 6, 21, 425287) I am firmly of opinion that, if the Congress does not clearly define its policy in this matter, it will end in proving itself to be a useless organization.
('80', 266, 7, 22, 425443) 1 Secretary, Gujarat Provincial Congress Committee.
('80', 266, 7, 23, 425495) According to the source, this letter was brought to Ahmedabad by Mahadev Desai for the guidance of Congressmen.
('80', 266, 7, 24, 425607) Mahadev Desai left for Ahmedabad on May 21; vide the following item.
('80', 267, 0, 1, 425676) 268 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 267, 1, 2, 425718) If a majority of Congressmen hold that violent resistance against an assailant is a duty, and if they do not regard it ,as inconsistent with the creed of the Congress, they should openly declare their opinion and guide people accordingly.
('80', 267, 1, 3, 425957) The absence of our leaders in jail should not deter anyone from declaring his opinion in this crisis.
('80', 267, 1, 4, 426059) It can be revised in case it is found later to be wrong.
('80', 267, 1, 5, 426116) The point is that no one should be in a state of indecisiveness.
('80', 267, 1, 6, 426181) I am sure that, if all Congressmen had done their duty, we should not have had the goondashahi—the reign of the goonda—that we had recently.
('80', 267, 1, 7, 426322) That people should flee for their lives for fear of the goonda should be intolerable.
('80', 267, 1, 8, 426408) They ought to possess the capacity of resisting goondashahi violently or non violently.
('80', 267, 1, 9, 426496) If my interpretation of the Congress creed is correct, the Congress and Congressmen may offer non violent resistance only, and they are sure to succeed.
('80', 267, 1, 10, 426649) But we should tell the people, in the clearest possible terms, that running away in fear is cowardice.
('80', 267, 1, 11, 426752) It is their duty to offer resistance—even violent, if they are incapable of non violent resistance, which is a worthy way.
('80', 267, 1, 12, 426875) Congressmen will not ask for the help of the Government, the police or the military.
('80', 267, 1, 13, 426960) Those who believe in violent resistance will indeed ask for Government’s help.
('80', 267, 1, 14, 427039) A Congressman may not directly or indirectly associate himself with gymnasia where training in violent resistance is given.
('80', 267, 1, 15, 427163) But he will appeal even to the believer in violent resistance to observe certain rules of restraint.
('80', 267, 1, 16, 427264) Even violent resistance admits of a certain amount of de cency.
('80', 267, 1, 17, 427328) Thus, for instance, murdering an innocent man in cold blood should be taboo.
('80', 267, 1, 18, 427405) The fundamental thing to be borne in mind is that people should, under no circumstances, be cowardly or impotent.
('80', 267, 1, 19, 427519) One need never be a goonda to fight a goonda.
('80', 267, 1, 20, 427565) One who stabs another in the back and takes to his heels will never be counted as brave.
('80', 267, 1, 21, 427654) A Congressman can have no prejudices, and so he would go out of his way to meet members of the Muslim League, the Hindu Maha sabha and other bodies in the interest of peace, and persuade them to combine in ruling out the law of the jungle, no matter how great their political differences.
('80', 267, 1, 22, 427943) That these endeavours may fail should not matter in the least.
('80', 267, 1, 23, 428006) It is their duty to appeal to everyone, and to flatter none.
('80', 267, 1, 24, 428067) The Congress will not claim compensation for losses sustained during the riots.
('80', 267, 1, 25, 428147) That is not its concern.
('80', 267, 1, 26, 428172) The people had to sustain losses as they lacked the capacity to defend themselves; and so they
('80', 268, 0, 1, 428267) VOL. 80 : 28 DECEMBER, 1940 17 AUGUST, 1941 269
('80', 268, 1, 2, 428315) must bear them.
('80', 268, 1, 3, 428331) I go so far as to believe that Government could not, even if they would, secure adequate compensation to those who have sustained losses.
('80', 268, 1, 4, 428469) I think it is terrible to think of protecting ourselves with the help of the Bhaiyya, the Sikh or the Thakurda.
('80', 268, 1, 5, 428581) To engage an ordinary durwan or gate keeper is a different proposition.
('80', 268, 1, 6, 428653) There should be no young man among the mercantile middle class community who hasnot gone through training for self defence, violent or non violent.
('80', 268, 1, 7, 428801) Engaging these foreign elements for defence, far from putting an end to goondashahi will put a premium on it.
('80', 268, 1, 8, 428911) Hindus staying in Muslim localities must not leave them, but stay on there even at the risk of their lives.
('80', 268, 1, 9, 429019) Muslims living in Hindu localities should be ensured the fullest protection by the Hindus.
('80', 268, 1, 10, 429110) The practice of closing down shops at the slightest rumour of disturbance should be stopped and every shopkeeper should be ready for violent or non violent self defence.
('80', 268, 1, 11, 429280) If they will cultivate this courage, the loss will be reduced to a minimum, and the riots would become a thing of the past.
('80', 268, 1, 12, 429404) Riots such as we have in our country are unknown in the West, though there may be civil wars there.
('80', 268, 1, 13, 429504) The reason is that the contending parties there are equally matched, and do not take to their heels at the sight of one another, nor do they ask for and accept police help.
('80', 268, 1, 14, 429677) The use of the police is entirely for protection against thieves and robbers.
('80', 268, 1, 15, 429755) In this respect we are absolutely barbarous and even impotent.
('80', 268, 1, 16, 429818) MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE: Mr. Mahadev Desai—President; Mr. Narahari Parikh—Vice President; Mr. Bhogilal and Mr. Gulzarilal Nanda—Secretaries; Mr. Jivanlal Divan, Mridula Sarabhai, Indumati Chimanlal, Mr. Khandubhai Desai and Raojibhai Patel.

('80', 270, 6, 24, 432522) [On or before May 22, 1941] 2
('80', 270, 7, 25, 432552) Replying to a question put by me, in the course of a special interview, whether he felt that the British Government would not come to any understanding with India, that they would prefer to continue the policy of drift, Mahatma Gandhi said: I am afraid, I have to say, ‘Yes’.
('80', 270, 7, 26, 432828) Quite; that has been their traditional policy and it seems that, even whilst they are fighting for their very existence, they do not or they will not revise their traditional policy.
('80', 270, 8, 27, 433011) Asked whether in the present circumstances the Congress should be content with merely recording its moral protest when moral values seemed to be the first victim in the war, Gandhiji replied: The Congress has no other value and no other influence.
('80', 270, 8, 28, 433259) Whilst it is true that moral values are the first victims in war, in the end they will emerge triumphant if there is any body of people ready to represent them.
('80', 270, 8, 29, 433420) And I have every hope that the Congress is at least

('80', 271, 1, 3, 433648) If I am asked for proof, I can’t give it.
('80', 271, 1, 4, 433690) Time alone will show.
('80', 271, 2, 5, 433712) When I drew Gandhiji’s attention to the remark 1 he made in the course of his statement on communal riots that mischief makers and their victims who failed to stand up to them were all untouched by Congress and yet these are the men who form the bulk of Congress meetings, Gandhiji replied: Yes, I have been obliged to say that because Congress has not been able to gain control over rowdy elements.
('80', 271, 2, 6, 434112) It does not matter to me whether these elements are supported by powerful organizations or, as some hint, encouraged by the British authorities.
('80', 271, 2, 7, 434257) I have no manner of doubt that the mass mind has to shed all fear of goondaism.
('80', 271, 2, 8, 434337) Whether that fear is shed violently or non violently, it has to be shed before we can defend ourselves not only against British might but the world.
('80', 271, 2, 9, 434486) The first condition of civilized life is that people are able to deal with goondaism, no matter how fomented.
('80', 271, 3, 10, 434596) Asked whether the report that no further list of satyagrahis is likely to be approved by him is correct, Gandhiji said that satyagraha is temporarily suspended in places where there is tension due to communal riots and where there are a large number of satyagrahis who have not yet been arrested.
('80', 271, 4, 11, 434893) To a question whether satyagrahis returning from jail will be required to offer satyagraha again, Gandhiji replied: Every one of them, I suppose, will go to jail from time to time until the whole question is settled for which civil disobedience is being offered, that is, until the object of civil disobedience is fulfilled.

('80', 273, 3, 5, 437236) Ba is in Delhi.
('80', 273, 3, 6, 437252) She has gone there for treatment by Dr. Sushila.
('80', 273, 3, 7, 437301) She will return on the 24th.
('80', 273, 3, 8, 437330) She has improved in health, though she is still weak.
('80', 273, 3, 9, 437384) I shall preserve your letter for her.
('80', 273, 3, 10, 437422) Your health department seems to be doing excellent work.
('80', 273, 3, 11, 437479) Many find it a great help.
('80', 273, 3, 12, 437506) You have given no news about your health.
('80', 273, 3, 13, 437548) May I, therefore, take it that it is fine?
('80', 273, 3, 14, 437591) You did very well in sending an extract from Jaiji’s letter.
('80', 273, 3, 15, 437652) It is excellent.
('80', 273, 3, 16, 437669) Tell her when you write that I remember her quite often.
('80', 273, 3, 17, 437726) What she says about the virtues of the British is correct, but the description is incomplete.
('80', 273, 3, 18, 437820) It is necessary for us to realize that their intoxication of power, highhandedness and blatant lies, seen here in India, show that their civilization is rooted in selfishness and love of pleasure.
('80', 273, 3, 19, 438017) If we do not get angry with them despite this knowledge and cultivate friendship, then alone will our ahimsa be worth the name.
('80', 273, 3, 20, 438145) We have not yet developed such ahimsa.
('80', 273, 3, 21, 438184) I hope everything is going on well there.
('80', 273, 3, 22, 438226) My blessings to all.

('80', 273, 8, 31, 438507) Without that how would your going to jail do you credit?
('80', 273, 8, 32, 438564) Should you not maintain all proprieties of conduct, all courtesies?
('80', 273, 8, 33, 438632) I keep getting news about your health.
('80', 273, 8, 34, 438671) But it is one thing your giving the news yourself and quite another thing my getting it.
('80', 273, 8, 35, 438760) Now write to me in detail.

('80', 274, 1, 15, 439435) Surendra has run away.
('80', 274, 1, 16, 439458) It is not known where he is.
('80', 274, 1, 17, 439487) He has misappropriated quite a sum.
('80', 274, 1, 18, 439523) My health is very good.
('80', 274, 1, 19, 439547) A. S. is the way she always has been.
('80', 274, 1, 20, 439585) That is how things are.
('80', 274, 1, 21, 439609) Munnalal had gone to learn the work of the Charkha Sangh.
('80', 274, 1, 22, 439667) He fell ill and came back.

('80', 274, 5, 30, 440028) May 22, 1941
('80', 274, 6, 31, 440041) SUSHILA, I have your letter.
('80', 274, 6, 32, 440070) You do not have to worry about the opposition from your brother.
('80', 274, 6, 33, 440135) He did not have the background to form an opinion.
('80', 274, 6, 34, 440186) And then does he also not think that my decision should be taken as final?
('80', 274, 6, 35, 440261) He told even Mahadev:“What have I got to say when Bapu has made the choice?” Moreover, at the root of his opposition is his love or att achment.
('80', 274, 6, 36, 440406) He wishes to see you at the top in everything.
('80', 274, 6, 37, 440453) He would certainly not tolerate that you should fail.
('80', 274, 6, 38, 440507) I would give no importance to your failing at all.
('80', 274, 6, 39, 440558) The value of examination lies in giving prestige to a person.
('80', 274, 6, 40, 440620) But those who fail do not lose their prestige, do they?
('80', 275, 0, 1, 440676) 276 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 275, 1, 2, 440718) There are many reasons for one’s failing.
('80', 275, 1, 3, 440760) Many clever persons are also known to have failed.
('80', 275, 1, 4, 440811) But I for one cannot believe that you can fail.
('80', 275, 1, 5, 440859) Both Durgabehn and Mahadevbhai will have arrived here by the time you come.
('80', 275, 1, 6, 440935) Munnalal has already come in a sick condition.
('80', 275, 1, 7, 440982) It is only malaria and he has been given cinchona and quinine.
('80', 275, 1, 8, 441045) He is better today.
('80', 275, 1, 9, 441065) I expect that Ba will be arriving the day after tomorrow.
('80', 275, 1, 10, 441123) Lilavati writes that she may delay her coming by a couple of days because Ramdas has arrived there.
('80', 275, 1, 11, 441223) Do not worry about Ba.
('80', 275, 1, 12, 441246) I shall continue your treatment here.
('80', 275, 1, 13, 441284) I shall be in trouble if Tari and Balkrishna fall sick again.

('80', 275, 6, 22, 441622) I have not been able to understand your imprisonment.

('80', 275, 6, 24, 441725) Saksena of course did right in refusing to be set free by giving an undertaking.
('80', 275, 6, 25, 441806) But even if one cannot resist the pressure of family feelings and gives an undertaking for one’s release, I shall put up with it.
('80', 275, 6, 26, 441936) The best thing of course is not to seek release.
('80', 275, 6, 27, 441985) I shall certainly try to push the good work of village industries that you had been doing.
('80', 275, 6, 28, 442076) But who can replace you?

('80', 277, 3, 4, 443722) BHAI PRITHVI SINGH, I got your letter.
('80', 277, 3, 5, 443761) Our training should only be on non violent lines.
('80', 277, 3, 6, 443811) So we cannot teach the use of the sword and other such violent weapons.
('80', 277, 3, 7, 443883) But we should certainly teach non violent defence even through them.
('80', 277, 3, 8, 443952) To use the sword against the sword is a violent defence.
('80', 277, 3, 9, 444009) To snatch the sword from the murderer would he non violent defence.
('80', 277, 3, 10, 444077) The best defence would be to surrender before the murderer and die.
('80', 277, 3, 11, 444145) For such defence we should have unlimited capacity for forgiveness.
('80', 277, 3, 12, 444213) For such people there will be no need of exercise or any other kind of training.
('80', 277, 3, 13, 444294) The training in exercise is for those who have not freed themselves from fear.
('80', 277, 3, 14, 444373) I am writing this with the intention of training those who do not know the difference between violence and non violence, and whom we want to train in non violent exercises.
('80', 277, 3, 15, 444546) I feel I have in brief covered everything.
('80', 277, 3, 16, 444589) Nathji and Kishorelalji may also see this and ask any other questions, if necessary.

('80', 277, 7, 20, 444824) WARDHA, May 23, 1941 It is but natural that nowadays I don’t feel like leaving Sevagram at all.
('80', 277, 7, 21, 444920) If I express a desire to do so I get invitations to various places.
('80', 277, 7, 22, 444988) But I am unable to complete the different jobs I have on hand at Sevagram.
('80', 277, 7, 23, 445063) That is why it is not possible for me to take interest in other things.
('80', 277, 7, 24, 445135) But then I thought to myself that so many boys are coming to
('80', 277, 8, 25, 445196) 1This appeared along with a note, which read: “This has been reported by newspapers also, but this is the authentic report of the speech which was delivered by Gandhiji at 8.20 p.m.
('80', 277, 8, 26, 445378) on May 23, 1941, at Wardha.”
('80', 278, 0, 1, 445407) VOL. 80 : 28 DECEMBER, 1940 17 AUGUST, 1941 279
('80', 278, 1, 2, 445455) Wardha and I wouldn’t like it if I am not able to mix freely with them or crack jokes with them.
('80', 278, 1, 3, 445552) So I myself agreed to come and attend the Camp.
('80', 278, 1, 4, 445600) Today my mind is full of only one thing.
('80', 278, 1, 5, 445641) I cannot think of anything except what has happened at Ahmedabad, Dacca, Bombay and in Bihar.
('80', 278, 1, 6, 445735) Riots have again started in Ahmedabad.
('80', 278, 1, 7, 445774) There are disturbances in Bombay, too.
('80', 278, 1, 8, 445813) I ask you, ‘‘What part are the youths supposed to play in these circumstances?” Every Indian should ask himself this question.
('80', 278, 1, 9, 445940) There are but two ways of facing this situation.
('80', 278, 1, 10, 445989) One is the age old way of the world—meeting violence with violence.
('80', 278, 1, 11, 446057) There is yet another way of defending oneself—that is, to peacefully endure the suffering and not to take revenge.
('80', 278, 1, 12, 446172) The first way is considered universal.
('80', 278, 1, 13, 446211) It is unmanly to run away from danger.
('80', 278, 1, 14, 446250) Dumb animals run away when beaten.
('80', 278, 1, 15, 446285) We should not be like them.
('80', 278, 1, 16, 446313) It only befits us to face the danger like men and sacrifice our lives while doing so if the occasion demands.
('80', 278, 1, 17, 446423) The Congress has shown the path of facing violence through non violence.
('80', 278, 1, 18, 446496) This is the only right way.
('80', 278, 1, 19, 446524) If you are not able to accept this, then it is your duty to fight the enemy as much as you like.
('80', 278, 1, 20, 446621) But do remember this—you have to fight only the assailant; to take revenge on innocent people is a sign of inhumanity and cowardice.
('80', 278, 1, 21, 446754) I wish you to make yourselves worthy of accepting the new and better way—the non violent way—of bravely dying for the cause.
('80', 278, 1, 22, 446879) You should neither give blow for blow nor run away for your life.
('80', 278, 1, 23, 446945) For the last twenty years we have been learning to put this supreme art into practice.
('80', 278, 1, 24, 447032) Today the situation is such that it is a challenge to our faith in the new way of self defence, i.e., non violence.
('80', 278, 1, 25, 447148) I hope you have been taught the art of facing such difficult situations.
('80', 278, 1, 26, 447221) At the moment every Congressman is put to a severe test.
('80', 278, 1, 27, 447278) If the Congress does not stand this test it will not have a right to exist as a national institution.
('80', 278, 1, 28, 447380) What counts most is that we should be true to ourselves.

('80', 283, 9, 22, 452925) If a man is passing through a forest alone, and someone stabs him in the back, he cannot do anything.
('80', 283, 9, 23, 453027) But according to your description, men were stabbed in many residential areas; in such places the assailant could easily be caught, or would be killed, provided the people are not cowardly.
('80', 283, 9, 24, 453217) The murder of one innocent person cannot be avenged by killing another innocent person.

('80', 289, 6, 13, 460235) I would not for a moment tolerate your suppressing your thoughts or simply parroting my views.
('80', 289, 6, 14, 460330) It would not become either of us.
('80', 289, 6, 15, 460364) You have the fullest liberty of thought and expression.
('80', 289, 6, 16, 460420) If there is an error, there is nothing to prevent us from correcting it.
('80', 289, 6, 17, 460493) But do remember that non violent resistance is far superior to violent resistance.
('80', 289, 6, 18, 460576) And if that is so, how can a votary of non violence resort to violence?
('80', 289, 6, 19, 460648) I have already made it absolutely clear that violentresistance becomes the duty of those who have no faith in non violence.
('80', 289, 7, 20, 460772) But I would ask you not to worry about these things while you are there.
('80', 289, 7, 21, 460845) Go to Kausani and soothe your eyes with the sight of the Dhavalgiri snows.
('80', 289, 7, 22, 460920) Do stay there longer, if you must, for the sake of your eyes.

('80', 291, 3, 4, 462529) KRISHNACHANDRA, If you have understood my letter 1, then the other two [questions] need no reply.
('80', 291, 3, 5, 462627) The pity is that both [you and Chimanlal] are ready to give up work.
('80', 291, 3, 6, 462696) What would you give up?
('80', 291, 3, 7, 462720) Duty or right?
('80', 291, 3, 8, 462735) Duty cannot be given up and there is no right.
('80', 291, 3, 9, 462782) You cannot give up what forms a part of duty, what is left is only a burden.
('80', 291, 3, 10, 462859) This applies to both you and Chimanlal.
('80', 291, 3, 11, 462899) If Chimanlal does not enjoy the privilege of a manager, then he is free, but what remains as part of duty has got to be done.
('80', 291, 3, 12, 463025) For example, if Surendra steals, then power has to be exercised to stop him from doing so.
('80', 291, 3, 13, 463116) But if he insults anyone, the use of power should be shunned.
('80', 291, 3, 14, 463178) Both of you should read this.

('80', 292, 3, 5, 463919) You are too simple to do any responsible work.
('80', 292, 3, 6, 463966) The girls are deceiving you.
('80', 292, 3, 7, 463995) You were near them.
('80', 292, 3, 8, 464015) How could Surendra thrust those things on them without your knowledge?

('80', 292, 3, 10, 464118) You are spoiling your children.

('80', 292, 4, 18, 464695) You are surely at liberty to say anything you like so long as you are truthful.
('80', 292, 4, 19, 464775) By private life, I meant taking any service on your merits.

('80', 295, 3, 5, 468318) I hope you will soon be restored.
('80', 295, 3, 6, 468352) Rajkumari is in Bombay.

('80', 295, 14, 17, 468776) Manibehn arrived yesterday.
('80', 295, 14, 18, 468804) She has grown very weak indeed.
('80', 295, 14, 19, 468836) Even so, I would have asked her to return to jail, but I think she can do very useful work in Ahmedabad.
('80', 295, 14, 20, 468941) I have, therefore, asked her to proceed there.
('80', 295, 14, 21, 468988) She will spend two or three days in Bombay.
('80', 295, 14, 22, 469032) She tells me that the condition of lavatories in the women’s ward is intolerable.
('80', 295, 14, 23, 469114) You should fight about this matter there.
('80', 295, 14, 24, 469156) It seems to be less a matter of expenditure than of indifference or lethargy.

('80', 296, 1, 5, 469503) What is destined to happen will happen.
('80', 296, 1, 6, 469543) Personally I believe it is a civil war that has started.
('80', 296, 1, 7, 469600) It remains to be seen how far it takes us.
('80', 296, 1, 8, 469643) Nobody can influence the events now.
('80', 296, 1, 9, 469680) I am not worrying at all.
('80', 296, 1, 10, 469706) I am guiding people according to my lights.

('80', 296, 6, 18, 470046) BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS, I have read your letter and also the enclosed.
('80', 296, 6, 19, 470112) We should not even think of such things.
('80', 296, 6, 20, 470153) I would do nothing here.
('80', 296, 6, 21, 470178) Yes, in the end everything will be as God ordains.
('80', 296, 6, 22, 470229) Then why should we worry?
('80', 296, 6, 23, 470255) We should take necessary precaution and give up fear.
('80', 296, 6, 24, 470309) I do not feel satisfied by keeping Gorkha watchmen and so on.
('80', 296, 6, 25, 470371) We may keep them but at the same time give up all fear, and learn to defend ourselves through violence or non violence.
('80', 296, 6, 26, 470491) We would perish if we depended on others.
('80', 296, 6, 27, 470533) People are cowardly, and that is why they are scared by such things; and there are lots of people in the world to scare them.
('80', 296, 6, 28, 470659) On this occasion my advice to you is to give up all fear, and tell others also to do so.
('80', 296, 6, 29, 470748) Such disturbances will go on and will increase.
('80', 296, 6, 30, 470796) They can die out if Hindus become brave in the true sense.
('80', 296, 6, 31, 470855) Such bravery cannot be gained in a day or two.
('80', 296, 6, 32, 470902) We can be secure if we understand the situation and face it.
('80', 296, 6, 33, 470963) It hurts me that our people even give up their moral stand.
('80', 296, 6, 34, 471023) How can the weak maintain their moral position?
('80', 296, 6, 35, 471071) Mahadev will be reaching Delhi.

('80', 297, 3, 5, 471308) ABRAHAM,
('80', 297, 4, 6, 471317) Here is a copy of the report on your letter.
('80', 297, 4, 7, 471362) It will be a pity if there is difference of opinion on facts.
('80', 297, 4, 8, 471424) It is likely that the riots had economic causes rather than religious.
('80', 297, 4, 9, 471495) But you will give me your considered opinion.

('80', 297, 9, 15, 471683) DEAR GOSAVI,
('80', 297, 10, 16, 471696) Our talk 2 was not for publication.
('80', 297, 10, 17, 471732) Something has already appeared.
('80', 297, 10, 18, 471764) It should not have.
('80', 297, 10, 19, 471784) I do not understand Marathi well.
('80', 297, 10, 20, 471818) But as far as I understand your notes, they faithfully interpret my answers.
('80', 297, 10, 21, 471895) It would be however better for me to put forth the whole thing in a form fit for publication.
('80', 297, 10, 22, 471989) If the socialist friends or any others resent my restrictions, of course it is open to them to take independent action.
('80', 297, 10, 23, 472109) This they can do by resigning from the Congress.
('80', 297, 10, 24, 472158) It would be rebellion, if they act independently while they remain in the Congress.
('80', 297, 10, 25, 472242) Their rebellion will be justified, if they carry the bulk of Congressmen with them in their revolt.
('80', 297, 10, 26, 472342) So you will see that my instructions in no way interfere with the independence of any single person.
('80', 297, 11, 27, 472443) 1 The source places this among the papers of 1941. Riots had broken out in Dacca, Ahmedabad and Bombay in March and April.

('80', 298, 1, 3, 472760) Where are you?
('80', 298, 1, 4, 472775) I have a feeling that you yourself do not like the restrictions I have suggested.
('80', 298, 1, 5, 472857) If so, you will fail in Maharashtra.
('80', 298, 1, 6, 472894) You won’t be able to carry on the struggle mechanically.

('80', 298, 8, 17, 473447) But I can explain without speaking.
('80', 298, 8, 18, 473483) Make a dhanush takli with a bamboo stick, and make the spindle from an umbrella spoke which I will send for.
('80', 298, 8, 19, 473592) Make as many such taklis as you can.
('80', 298, 8, 20, 473629) It is an easy job.
('80', 298, 8, 21, 473648) You will also learn something as you do it.

('80', 300, 11, 20, 475906) BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS, The letter has had no effect on me because I did not find anything new in it.
('80', 300, 11, 21, 476003) If I had written anything about that, I would have given them another chance to tell lies, and it would have been of no use.
('80', 300, 11, 22, 476128) The principle is that except for doing our own duty we should notbother about anything else.
('80', 300, 11, 23, 476221) But my unwillingness had nothing to do with the principle.
('80', 300, 11, 24, 476280) I am glad to know that there is no atmosphere of fear in Calcutta.
('80', 300, 11, 25, 476347) It would be very satisfying if at the back of this fearlessness is a restraint in taking revenge.
('80', 300, 11, 26, 476445) Perhaps the riots, etc., will increase but it will be good if neither party goes beyond limits; any other course

('80', 301, 6, 11, 476957) I hope however that your mother has survived the illness.
('80', 301, 6, 12, 477015) Of course no son wants to be away from mother’s bedside.
('80', 301, 7, 13, 477072) The fact is he 2 was a selfless friend and guide to so many.
('80', 301, 7, 14, 477133) Such was his goodness.
('80', 301, 7, 15, 477156) May his spirit sustain us and enable us to so conduct ourselves as to prove worthy of him.
('80', 301, 7, 16, 477247) You vainly approach me for relief and strength.
('80', 301, 7, 17, 477295) I have none of his great medical skill nor do I possess the knowledge of you all that he had.
('80', 301, 7, 18, 477389) But I know God has given you strength and courage enough to bear the separation.

('80', 301, 7, 20, 477542) It seems to have cooled down a bit today.
('80', 301, 7, 21, 477584) You know that Jamnalalji has been discharged on medical grounds.
('80', 301, 7, 22, 477649) He is much reduced but purposely.
('80', 301, 7, 23, 477683) The question is whether he will be able to get rid of his arthritis.
('80', 301, 7, 24, 477752) He is in Sevagram undergoing the same dietetic course he was having in the jail.
('80', 301, 7, 25, 477833) Of course there is no cause for anxiety.

('80', 302, 7, 16, 478848) MY DEAR SHUAIB, I assume that you have seen my statements on the riots.
('80', 302, 7, 17, 478920) 4 They have come in for much hostile criticism on the part of Muslim correspondents.
('80', 302, 7, 18, 479005) I would like your reaction to my statements.
('80', 302, 7, 19, 479050) If you have not read them, I would get the cuttings and send them.
('80', 302, 7, 20, 479117) My remark that in Dacca and Ahmedabad the start was made by Muslim goondas has been specially resented.
('80', 302, 7, 21, 479221) I wonder what you have to say to that remark.
('80', 302, 7, 22, 479267) What disturbs me most are the indecent stabbings and the like.
('80', 302, 7, 23, 479330) Whatever the political differences between parties or communities, a resolute attempt should be made to avoid the use of the law of the jungle.

('80', 303, 6, 10, 480130) I had nothing special to say.
('80', 303, 6, 11, 480160) It would be a very good thing if you just now devote yourself to the dhanush takli and learn to make it.
('80', 303, 6, 12, 480265) That will give you both peace of mind and knowledge, besides enabling you to serve Daridranarayana.
('80', 303, 6, 13, 480365) Afterwards you will of course appear for both the examinations simultaneously.
('80', 303, 6, 14, 480444) We will send Kanchan to Valod or Bangalore when Sushilabehn returns.
('80', 303, 6, 15, 480513) Her own wish is to stay here till you have fully regained strength.
('80', 303, 6, 16, 480581) Don’t hurt her in any way.

('80', 304, 6, 8, 481029) DEAR GOSAVI, I have your clear and unequivocal letter.
('80', 304, 6, 9, 481084) It was not a question of suspicion.
('80', 304, 6, 10, 481120) But as you had not made your position clear in your letter or during our talks 3, I was bound to find out where you yourself stood.
('80', 304, 6, 11, 481252) I well remember your being with Prof.
('80', 304, 6, 12, 481290) Limaye and others.

('80', 304, 6, 14, 481428) I return the questions and answers duly corrected.

('80', 304, 9, 18, 481567) 1 Miss Eleanor Rathbone, M. P., in an open letter addressed to Indian friends, had said that she saw a risk that the attitude of most of her British friends who were concentrating on the question of how far the British Government might be blamed for Indian deadlock and what they could possibly do to end it might mislead non co operating Indians into thinking that all progressive minded British people were with them in throwing the whole blame on the British authorities.
('80', 304, 9, 19, 482042) Hence, she said, she was moved to take the opposite course by trying to set down the opposite side as she saw it—the case against non co operators.
('80', 304, 9, 20, 482190) The correspondent had asked Gandhiji whether he wished to say anything in reply to Miss Rathbone’s letter.

('80', 305, 8, 10, 482715) SEVAGRAM, June 9, 1941
('80', 305, 9, 11, 482738) I have read and re read with shame and sorrow an official account of the cool, calculated and unprovoked murder of a Muslim family including an infant girl, three years old.
('80', 305, 9, 12, 482912) Though Rajendra Babu is doing glorious work on behalf of communal peace in Bihar, it is impossible for me to suppress my own opinion on this cruel crime.
('80', 305, 9, 13, 483066) The perpetrators, whoever they may be, have done no good either to themselves or their religion, if they have any, or to this country.
('80', 305, 9, 14, 483201) This I say apart from my views on ahimsa.
('80', 305, 9, 15, 483243) I suggest that on no ground, even of violence, can such murders be defended.
('80', 305, 9, 16, 483320) Repeated on a wide scale they must reduce our fair land to savagery and make the country’s freedom an impossibility.
('80', 305, 9, 17, 483437) No government can cope with such crimes.
('80', 305, 9, 18, 483478) They can only punish the miscreants after the event and that only if they are found.
('80', 305, 9, 19, 483563) In the latter case, the punishment is likely to be as indiscriminate and savage as the crime itself.
('80', 305, 9, 20, 483664) I, therefore, advise the perpetrators with all the force my words may possess to deliver themselves up unconditionally to the authorities for such punishment as the latter may think fit to award.
('80', 305, 9, 21, 483860) This act of repentance, tardy though it will be, will somewhat recompense for the grievous crime committed.
('80', 305, 9, 22, 483968) They will thereby purge themselves, their religion andtheir country to some extent of the disgrace that attaches to the crime.
('80', 305, 10, 23, 484095) 1 The addressee, who was sentenced to one and a half years’ imprisonment for offering satyagraha, had sought Gandhiji’s advice regarding the suspension of his licence of Pleadership under the Defence of India Rules.

('80', 306, 5, 8, 484749) I see that Chandrashankar has no more trust in your impartiality.
('80', 306, 5, 9, 484815) He often writes to Mahadev, and sometimes to me also, complaining against you, but I didn’t think it necessary to take up your time by sending his letters to you.
('80', 306, 5, 10, 484978) I have written to him that the final decision will be mine and that your report will cover only the figures.

('80', 306, 10, 16, 485222) I have been watching the conflict among the students with pain and detachment.
('80', 306, 10, 17, 485301) I can thus neither send a message nor depute a leader.
('80', 306, 10, 18, 485356) And it is in this that the good of the student community lies.
('80', 306, 10, 19, 485419) You must resolve the quarrel amongst yourselves.
('80', 306, 10, 20, 485468) How this is to be done I have explained in my exposition of satyagraha.
('80', 306, 10, 21, 485540) Nothing should be done out of cowardice, nothing at all from malice and nothing to gain power.
('80', 306, 10, 22, 485635) You should also keep away from active politics.
('80', 306, 10, 23, 485683) If even a handful of students remember this and work accordingly, others will in time begin to follow them.

('80', 307, 2, 5, 486069) Because of my foolishness or ignorance I have mild dysentery and slight fever.
('80', 307, 2, 6, 486148) If Sushilabehn had not forbidden me, I could have easily come to the dining room.
('80', 307, 2, 7, 486230) But I follow the instructions of the doctors as far as possible.

('80', 307, 6, 15, 486587) It is but natural for a girl to wish to stay with her parents.
('80', 307, 6, 16, 486650) It is not quite necessary that she should stay with you.

('80', 310, 5, 10, 490132) SEVAGRAM, June 15, 1941 Shri K. M. Munshi wrote to me the enclosed 1 from Nainital to which I sent a reply 2 in Gujarati of which the original and translation are herewith enclosed.
('80', 310, 5, 11, 490314) In pursuance of the correspondence, Shri K. M. Munshi came to me 3 as soon as it was possible after his return to Bombay.
('80', 310, 5, 12, 490436) In the course of the discussion, I discovered that whilst he accepted in the abstract the principle of ahimsa with all its implications, he felt the greatest difficulty in acting upon it, the more so as with his intimate knowledge of Bombay he was sure that he could not carry the Hindus with him, much less the Muslims.
('80', 310, 5, 13, 490757) He knew that the numerous Hindus who were under his influence would look to him for guidance and would seek his advice.
('80', 310, 5, 14, 490877) He saw no way of convincing them that they could defend themselves through ahimsa.
('80', 310, 5, 15, 490960) As a political weapon and therefore of immediate use in the midst of the riots which looked more like a miniature civil war, he could not make any effective use of ahimsa.
('80', 310, 5, 16, 491132) With him the question was not one of interpretation of Congress resolutions but of being truthful to himself and to the country.
('80', 310, 5, 17, 491261) In view, therefore, of the following resolution 4 by the A.I.C.C. explaining the Wardha statement, I advised that the only dignified and brave course for him was to resign from the Congress and attain freedom of action unhampered by restrictions entailed by the Congress non violence.
('80', 310, 6, 18, 491546) 1 Vide “Letter to K. M. Munshi”, 26 5 1941 2 Vide”Letter to K. M. Munshi”, 29 5 1941 3 On June 12, 1941; vide “Discussion with K. M. Munshiu and Others”, 12 6 1941 4 Passed at Poona on July 28, 1940.
('80', 311, 0, 1, 491746) 312 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 311, 1, 2, 491788) The A.I.C.C. has considered the statement issued by the Working Committee from Wardha on June 21, 1940, and confirmed it.
('80', 311, 1, 3, 491910) The A.I.C.C. is of opinion that as explained therein, while the Congress must continue to adhere strictly to the principle of non violence in the struggle for independence, it is unable, in the present circumstances, to declare that the principle should be extended to free India’s national defence.
('80', 311, 1, 4, 492210) The A.I.C.C. desires to affirm that the Congress organization should continue to be conducted on the principle of non violence and all Congress volunteers are bound by their pledge to remain non violent in the discharge of their duty and no Congress volunteers’ organization can be formed or maintained except on that basis.
('80', 311, 1, 5, 492535) Any other volunteers’ organization for the purpose of self defence with which Congressmen are associated must likewise adhere to non violence.
('80', 311, 1, 6, 492678) I told him that there came a time in every Congressman’s life when being a Congressman dragged him down; that was when there was conflict between thought and action.
('80', 311, 1, 7, 492844) For the spring of non violent action was non violent thought.
('80', 311, 1, 8, 492906) If the latter was absent, the former had subjectively little or no value.
('80', 311, 1, 9, 492980) Therefore it was good for him, the Congress and the country that he should resign and mould hisaction from moment to moment as he thought proper.
('80', 311, 1, 10, 493126) And by his action he would open the door for those Congressmen to resign whose practice could not accord with their thought.
('80', 311, 1, 11, 493251) The Congress was conceived to be a non violent and truthful organization in which there should be no place for those who could not honestly conform to these two conditions.
('80', 311, 1, 12, 493424) Strange as it might appear, the practice of non violence seemed more difficult than of truth.
('80', 311, 1, 13, 493518) For the fruits of untruth were more indetectable than those of violence.
('80', 311, 1, 14, 493591) My advice appealed to Shri Munshi.
('80', 311, 1, 15, 493626) And he has decided to accept it.
('80', 311, 1, 16, 493659) 1 He will go because he could not be disloyal to the Congress he has so long served.
('80', 311, 1, 17, 493744) And it does not at all follow that his resignation means that from being a meek and mild man he suddenly becomes a fierce man, vowing vengeance on those whom he may consider to be opponents, or that he becomes a communal anti nationalist.
('80', 311, 1, 18, 493983) I have no doubt that for him every non Hindu whose only home is India is as much Indian as a Hindu, born and bred in India.
('80', 311, 1, 19, 494107) I congratulate him upon taking the step he will and I have every hope that his resignation from the Congress will enable him to utilize his faculties so as to make a decisive contribution towards the establishment of lasting peace in Bombay.

('80', 312, 2, 3, 494565) SEVAGRAM, June 15, 1941
('80', 312, 3, 4, 494589) DEAR SISTERS, We have very carefully studied your message addressed to India’s women.
('80', 312, 3, 5, 494675) We write this in our individual capacity, as also that of representative members of the A.I.W.C. which, as you know, is an organization of fifteen years’ standing.
('80', 312, 3, 6, 494839) We mention this to show that what we state here is not only our deep personal conviction, but also, as far as we can judge, the conviction of a large body of India’s women.
('80', 312, 3, 7, 495012) It is scarcely necessary to tell you that we appreciate the sincerity of your appeal.
('80', 312, 3, 8, 495098) But we are amazed at the ignorance betrayed in it of the realities.
('80', 312, 3, 9, 495166) Indeed your Prime Minister 2 by contrast shows a grasp of realities which is refreshing, however painful it may be.
('80', 312, 3, 10, 495282) He has no misgivings about the status that India occupies in the British mind.
('80', 312, 3, 11, 495361) It is a dependency which can and is being utilized at the British will.
('80', 312, 3, 12, 495433) He knows that he does not need the consent or co operation of India’s thinking sons and daughters in anything that Britain wants for fighting her war.
('80', 312, 3, 13, 495584) He takes care to pay tribute to the valour of the Indian soldiers who are part of the army of occupation in India.
('80', 312, 3, 14, 495699) These soldiers you should know are wholly unconnected with the national life and activities.
('80', 312, 3, 15, 495792) They may not freely see any nationalist without incurring heavy penalties, nor has your Prime Minister any difficulty in raising either by taxation or so called voluntary contributions the money he wants.
('80', 312, 3, 16, 495997) We cannot complain of this helplessness but we must not be blind to the facts.
('80', 312, 3, 17, 496076) How can there be the association, in such a situation, of the India that is impatient of the foreign yoke with the forcible aid we have adverted to?
('80', 312, 3, 18, 496225) The fact is that you are wholly wrong in your estimate of things.
('80', 312, 3, 19, 496291) We are surprised at your quoting the untruth contained in President Roosevelt’s pronouncement.
('80', 312, 3, 20, 496386) You quote: “Today the whole world is

('80', 313, 0, 1, 496689) 314 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 313, 1, 2, 496731) divided between human slavery and human freedom.” 1 The fact is that there is no such thing as human freedom for Asiatic races, certainly not for India, nor is there for the virile Africans.
('80', 313, 1, 3, 496922) The result, whatever it may be, of the war will not alter their condition for the better, save through their own efforts.
('80', 313, 1, 4, 497044) As we see the reality, it is this.
('80', 313, 1, 5, 497079) It is a war between the British Empire and Nazis and Fascists for world domination, meaning in effect exploitation of the non European races.
('80', 313, 1, 6, 497221) We cannot be in love with Nazism and Fascism.
('80', 313, 1, 7, 497267) But we may not be expected to be in love with British Imperialism.
('80', 313, 1, 8, 497334) Now perhaps you will understand why we as women are against all war.
('80', 313, 1, 9, 497403) Women’s part is just now to stand up for truth and non violence as against the untruth and violence which surround us.
('80', 313, 1, 10, 497522) We admire the self sacrifice of the British women of which you write with just pride.
('80', 313, 1, 11, 497608) Here we wish you could have taken a braver andprouder part by telling your men to wash their hands clean of human blood.
('80', 313, 1, 12, 497729) You might not have succeeded all at once.
('80', 313, 1, 13, 497771) But you would have led the way to the establishment of permanent peace.
('80', 313, 1, 14, 497843) We take leave to doubt the wisdom of women aping men in the black art of human slaughter on a scale hitherto unknown.
('80', 313, 1, 15, 497961) Lastly, let us point out the anomaly of British women asking India, though a slave nation, to help the slave owner in distress instead of asking the slave owner to undo the wrong and cure himself of the initial sin and thus ensure the moral justness of his position.
('80', 313, 1, 16, 498228) This presentation of the picture may appear unpleasant to you but it is none the less sincere.
('80', 313, 1, 17, 498323) And we could not answer your sincerity except by being equally sincere.

('80', 313, 5, 21, 498468) KRISHNACHANDRA, The way to hand over the kitchen to Harijans is to train those men and women who work steadily and to leave the others out.
('80', 313, 5, 22, 498608) In the beginning one of us should supervise their work.
('80', 313, 5, 23, 498664) This sort of arrangement prevails in all institutions.

('80', 314, 1, 2, 498824) The rules of the kitchen continue to be the same.
('80', 314, 1, 3, 498874) The change is only in the case of fruit.
('80', 314, 1, 4, 498915) It should be served to those who must have it and to others when available.
('80', 314, 1, 5, 498991) Mangoes will go out in a few days now.
('80', 314, 1, 6, 499030) Serve papayas when they become available.
('80', 314, 1, 7, 499072) If you can give fruit to everyone by all means do so.
('80', 314, 1, 8, 499126) Nothing is to be given to anyone because he likes it but Ba is exempted from this rule.
('80', 314, 1, 9, 499214) Shakaribehn can prepare something for herself, if she desires.
('80', 314, 1, 10, 499277) In the ease of others anything outside the menu may be prepared only if specially instructed by me.
('80', 314, 1, 11, 499377) Of course you know about Shastriji.
('80', 314, 1, 12, 499413) This covers everything.

('80', 314, 6, 17, 499562) DEAR SISTER, I got your letter today.
('80', 314, 6, 18, 499600) I received the dhoti.
('80', 314, 6, 19, 499622) I wore it the next day and will use it more.
('80', 314, 6, 20, 499667) I understand the affection it symbolizes.
('80', 314, 6, 21, 499709) Only our actions will lead to the spread of ahimsa.
('80', 314, 6, 22, 499761) Harijan cannot be published right now.
('80', 314, 6, 23, 499800) Publishing it will itself harm the truth.
('80', 314, 6, 24, 499842) But we should have faith that thought is more effective than speech and writing.
('80', 314, 6, 25, 499923) If I hold pure thoughts, it is my firm belief, they must be having their effect, and this will spread.
('80', 314, 6, 26, 500026) What happened in Garhwal is rather sad.
('80', 314, 6, 27, 500066) I feel that you or Bapa should go there.
('80', 314, 6, 28, 500107) And if possible both of you should go.
('80', 314, 6, 29, 500146) If the settlement is broken, you must go there and restore it.
('80', 314, 6, 30, 500209) It is essential that at least one of you should visit the place at once.
('80', 314, 6, 31, 500282) The path of service is hard indeed.
('80', 314, 6, 32, 500318) I hope you were not worried on hearing of my illness.
('80', 314, 6, 33, 500372) Now I am quite all right.

('80', 315, 9, 14, 501129) You have to bear it with fortitude.
('80', 315, 9, 15, 501165) There is a tuberculosis hospital in Delhi but it is for the benefit of Delhi people only and is always full.
('80', 315, 9, 16, 501274) But the one at Bhowali is the best, where people belonging to the U.P. are given priority, and there is another at Dharampur.
('80', 315, 9, 17, 501400) There is no cause for worry.
('80', 315, 9, 18, 501429) If Rajendra observes restraint in diet he will recover.
('80', 315, 9, 19, 501485) If the tuberculosis is in its early stages it is not incurable.

('80', 326, 1, 3, 514006) Jivrambhai was rich.
('80', 326, 1, 4, 514027) According to me he was an ideal trustee.
('80', 326, 1, 5, 514068) He gave his money for the spread of the charkha among the poor of Orissa.
('80', 326, 1, 6, 514142) He himself lived like the poor of Orissa and all the twenty four hours his thoughts were full of the welfare of the people of Orissa.
('80', 326, 1, 7, 514276) Shri Ishwarlal describes his last days thus:
('80', 326, 2, 8, 514321) He suffered from diarrhoea for nearly three months.
('80', 326, 2, 9, 514373) He stopped taking medicines from the 18th June, 1941. He said: “I have been taking medicines for the last three months and there is no improvement.
('80', 326, 2, 10, 514521) So now let it be as God wills.” He was using mud packs.
('80', 326, 2, 11, 514577) He had completely given up food.
('80', 326, 2, 12, 514610) He took mosambi juice which also he gave up later.
('80', 326, 2, 13, 514661) Since the morning of the 23rd he did not take even water.
('80', 326, 2, 14, 514719) He used to rinse his mouth when his throat went dry.
('80', 326, 2, 15, 514772) I told him: “Please take some water”.
('80', 326, 2, 16, 514810) He replied: “Don’t you see I am losing my breath?” This he said in the morning and till ten minutes to three he was fully conscious.
('80', 326, 2, 17, 514943) Within ten minutes all of a sudden he was unconscious and lay stiff.
('80', 326, 2, 18, 515012) Without any movement, slowly the breathing stopped.
('80', 326, 2, 19, 515064) Let us all become like him.
('80', 326, 2, 20, 515092) May God grant us such a noble death.

('80', 326, 6, 25, 515250) DEAR MOTI BABU, Shri Jajuji has sent me the file regarding Prabartak Sangha.
('80', 326, 6, 26, 515327) I was distressed on reading it.
('80', 326, 6, 27, 515359) The A.I.S.A. is a huge concern which has the poorest of the land as its only concern.
('80', 326, 6, 28, 515445) It must put all its transactions on a sound legal footing.
('80', 326, 6, 29, 515504) Then only can it be morally sound.
('80', 326, 6, 30, 515539) I therefore do not understand the hesitation to give the required promissory note.
('80', 326, 6, 31, 515622) Indeed, the debt should have been paid off long ago.
('80', 326, 6, 32, 515675) And why this hesitation to get the certificate?
('80', 326, 6, 33, 515723) If you cannot accept the requirements, surely the least you should do is to stop khadi work altogether.

('80', 329, 6, 15, 519049) In view of the notice given by you, I suppose you must court imprisonment, but if the Government had good grounds for releasing you, it would be violence to court imprisonment.

('80', 330, 6, 23, 521107) No appreciation is therefore needed for doing what is natural, even as there need be none for a man being what he is.
('80', 330, 6, 24, 521225) Yes, Zohra has written.
('80', 330, 6, 25, 521249) She asks for permission, but I have asked her to wait.

('80', 330, 6, 28, 521429) I am quite well.
('80', 330, 6, 29, 521446) There was nothing but a passing distemper.
('80', 330, 6, 30, 521489) I admit even that should not have been.
('80', 330, 6, 31, 521529) I regard every distemper as a breach of nature’s laws.
('80', 330, 6, 32, 521584) That we are often unconscious is no excuse.

('80', 331, 6, 8, 522012) You must have seen from my statement 1 that the Congress policy is quite clear.
('80', 331, 6, 9, 522092) The clarity was achieved after a long discussion.
('80', 331, 6, 10, 522142) Hence those who do not accept that particular portion of the Poona resolution have no option but to leave the Congress, and that is why I persuaded Bhai Munshi to take the step he has taken.
('80', 331, 6, 11, 522333) Now if what I understand about your views is correct, your path is clear.
('80', 331, 6, 12, 522407) You should come out openly with your view and try to cultivate public opinion inaccordance with it.
('80', 331, 6, 13, 522507) This is an age of action.
('80', 331, 6, 14, 522533) All of us will be judged by our actions.
('80', 331, 6, 15, 522574) A heavy responsibility rests on the Congress.
('80', 331, 6, 16, 522620) It can be discharged only if there is perfect correspondence between our views and our actions.
('80', 331, 6, 17, 522716) We claim to represent the 35 crores.
('80', 331, 6, 18, 522753) I am addressing this to you personally, but I should like all of you to think over it.

('80', 332, 1, 7, 523648) The path of ahimsa can lead to success only if all those who adopt it believe in it whole heartedly.

('80', 333, 1, 5, 524913) It has stopped just now.
('80', 333, 1, 6, 524938) I have been working .full speed, none the worse for the fast.
('80', 333, 1, 7, 525000) Sushila has gone to Nagpur to accompany Usha for medical examination of her womb by Dr. Martin.

('80', 333, 5, 14, 525398) Along with his success, Shri Narandas’s ambition and en thusiasm go on increasing from year to year.
('80', 333, 5, 15, 525499) So should it be with all those who have faith.
('80', 333, 5, 16, 525546) The scope for khadi is as wide, at least, as the boundaries of India.
('80', 333, 5, 17, 525616) This terrible; suicidal war may perhaps show that khadi, i.e., the principle of self reliance for meeting one’s needs, is of universal application.
('80', 333, 5, 18, 525764) Be that as it may, for India, at any rate, the spinning wheel is the sole means of ending simultaneously both poverty and unemployment.
('80', 333, 5, 19, 525900) I, therefore, hope that Kathiawar will completely fulfil Narandas’s ambition.
('80', 333, 5, 20, 525978) It should be remembered that the use of khadi is spreading in Kathiawar.
('80', 333, 5, 21, 526051) It should, therefore, produce locally all the khadi it needs.
('80', 333, 5, 22, 526113) This will necessarily require more money.
('80', 333, 5, 23, 526155) In view of this, all the money received this time will be used for production of khadi.
('80', 333, 5, 24, 526243) Narandas hopes to collect at least one lakh rupees in the coming 72 days.
('80', 333, 5, 25, 526317) May this hope be fulfilled!

('80', 335, 2, 3, 528007) [July 2, 1941] 1
('80', 335, 3, 4, 528024) For domestic reasons in which the public is not interested I had to come back to Bengal leaving my two elder sons under Gandhiji’s care.
('80', 335, 3, 5, 528161) On arrival in Bengal I proceeded at once to Dacca as I had thought under Gandhiji’s instructions.
('80', 335, 3, 6, 528259) And I made a long statement about my going to Dacca.
('80', 335, 3, 7, 528312) On seeing the statementGandhiji in a telegram 2 repudiated it and said that he had never given me any instructions but that he had said that if I felt like it I could go to Dacca on my own responsibility and without fuss immolate myself there whilst trying to serve both the communities.
('80', 335, 3, 8, 528600) I am sorry I misunderstood his instructions.
('80', 335, 3, 9, 528645) I well recall his repeatedly saying to me as to all workers that we had to work silently and selflessly.
('80', 335, 3, 10, 528750) But in the impulse of the moment I forgot myself and was betrayed into making a long statement up to which I could not live.
('80', 335, 3, 11, 528875) In Dacca I was in need of directions without which I could not do work.
('80', 335, 3, 12, 528947) I wired to Gandhiji for them and he wired 3saying he could issue none and that I should come away and work for my living which I am trying to do.

('80', 340, 7, 14, 535924) It is a grand thing to feel that your movements are fixed for you without taxing you.
('80', 340, 7, 15, 536010) If servants do so they are faithful, if friends do so they may at least get that much credit.
('80', 340, 7, 16, 536104) And imagine what opportunity you get for doing your work!
('80', 340, 7, 17, 536162) But we are living in an ungracious world.
('80', 340, 7, 18, 536204) What is to be done?
('80', 340, 7, 19, 536224) Sikander is here feeling lonely without you.

('80', 342, 6, 10, 538433) What you say is true.
('80', 342, 6, 11, 538455) Sometimes, while trying to rush through work, I do forget to reply to some letters and I reply to some twice over, as it happened in your case.
('80', 342, 6, 12, 538599) Is it not better to reply twice rather than not reply at all?
('80', 342, 6, 13, 538661) Even as I was writing to you I felt that I had replied to that letter earlier.
('80', 342, 6, 14, 538740) As a rule, I reply to your letters by return of post.
('80', 342, 6, 15, 538794) But in this case I did not note on the letter the date of my reply and hence the mistake.
('80', 342, 6, 16, 538884) But all this is idle talk.

('80', 347, 2, 3, 545391) SEVAGRAM, July 6, 1941 When Mian Saheb Iftikhar ud Din, President of the Punjab Provincial Congress Committee, and Dr. Gopichand were with me the other day, Mian Saheb told me that there was some misunderstanding among some Congressmen about certain things which required clearing.
('80', 347, 2, 4, 545673) I should have dealt with them earlier.
('80', 347, 2, 5, 545712) But pressure of work and my limited capacity for disposal are responsible for the delay.
('80', 347, 2, 6, 545801) I take them up now.
('80', 347, 2, 7, 545821) When the Punjab Bar patriotically took up the honourable role of amicus curiae and decided to bring before their High Court for revision the cases of satyagrahis in which, in their opinion, obvious injustice was done, I was delighted, not for the sake of the relief such revision might bring, but for the sake of the Punjab Bar and of purity of justice.
('80', 347, 2, 8, 546175) Whilst satyagrahis must be indifferent to the sentences pronounced against them, they must welcome exposure of injustice especially when it is brought about at the instance of disinterested parties.
('80', 347, 2, 9, 546374) When, therefore, Ismet Begum wired and wrote to me that her husband was much displeased and disturbed over the prospect of revision, I urged her not to interfere and asked her to tell her husband that there was nothing wrong about the revision and that if he was discharged it would be open to him to offer civil disobedience again.
('80', 347, 2, 10, 546707) Of course the matter wears a different and ugly aspect when satyagrahi prisoners request the amicus curiae that they should take up their (prisoners’) cases.
('80', 347, 2, 11, 546865) Such conduct would be quite contrary to the satyagraha code.
('80', 347, 2, 12, 546926) Complaints are being made in several parts as in the Punjab that the new lists of satyagrahis are not being passed as fast as they are sent.
('80', 347, 2, 13, 547067) There is no lack of despatch in the Punjab or any other province as to the lists.
('80', 347, 2, 14, 547149) But I am in no hurry to pass them.
('80', 347, 2, 15, 547184) I repeat for the thousandth time that the present civil disobedience is not only not designed to embarrass authority but care is being taken as far as possible to avoid all embarrassment.
('80', 347, 2, 16, 547372) The merit as also the strength of the struggle consists in reducing embarrassment to the minimum whilst the British are engaged in a deadly life and death war.
('80', 347, 2, 17, 547532) Moreover, since our struggle is going to be indefinitely prolonged —I
('80', 348, 0, 1, 547602) VOL. 80 : 28 DECEMBER, 1940 17 AUGUST, 1941 349
('80', 348, 1, 2, 547650) give no less than five years—there need be no hurry to fill the jails.
('80', 348, 1, 3, 547721) Mere filling of jails can bring us no nearer our freedom than we are now.
('80', 348, 1, 4, 547795) The virtue lies in the people learning through the restricted civil disobedience the necessity of discipline, suffering and self sacrifice.
('80', 348, 1, 5, 547935) Every true example of satyagraha acts as a leaven working itself in the mass mind.
('80', 348, 1, 6, 548018) During the initial stages I was purposely lax in scanning the lists.
('80', 348, 1, 7, 548087) The result was that many crept in who had done no constructive work.
('80', 348, 1, 8, 548156) Some had even no faith in it.
('80', 348, 1, 9, 548186) These are a burden on the organization and positively hinder the march to freedom.
('80', 348, 1, 10, 548269) I have said repeatedly that constructive work is the foundation for civil disobedience.
('80', 348, 1, 11, 548357) It promotes discipline and conduces to the growth of non violence in the worker.
('80', 348, 1, 12, 548438) As time advances Congressmen must therefore expect increasing stiffness on my part.
('80', 348, 1, 13, 548522) The conditions will be the same.
('80', 348, 1, 14, 548555) Strictness will be confined to the enforcement.
('80', 348, 1, 15, 548603) This is but natural if we are to grow from strength to strength and if we are to make the struggle increasingly purer.
('80', 348, 1, 16, 548722) I can conduct it on no other terms.
('80', 348, 1, 17, 548758) Then Mian Saheb mentioned to me that some Congressmen had adversely criticized his move for achieving among all parties in the Punjab agreement about eschewing goondaism in the pursuit of their respective programmes.
('80', 348, 1, 18, 548975) When the Mian Saheb told me that there was just a possibility of such an effort succeeding, I at once told him to make it and suspend for the time being his own civil disobedience and of those whose assistance he might consider necessary for the arduous task.
('80', 348, 1, 19, 549235) Some Congressmen seem to have taken exception that Mian Saheb had invited to his meeting non Congressmen and even communal leaders.
('80', 348, 1, 20, 549367) The objectors forget that it is the essence of Mian Saheb’s move to bring together all the opposite elements and see whether they could agree to eschew goondaism for the achievement of their respective purposes.
('80', 348, 1, 21, 549579) Nor could there be in such a meeting decisions by counting heads.
('80', 348, 1, 22, 549645) The end contemplated could only be achieved by the willing consent of the parties.
('80', 348, 1, 23, 549728) In any event Congressmen should know that Mian Saheb has undertaken this difficult mission in consultation with me and with my whole hearted consent.
('80', 348, 1, 24, 549878) I hope that he will receive the closest co operation of all Congressmen.
('80', 348, 1, 25, 549951) He is impatient to offer civil disobedience.
('80', 348, 1, 26, 549996) As the head of the Congress in the Punjab, he thinks that his primary duty is to offer civil disobedience.
('80', 348, 1, 27, 550103) I have told him that there is no such universal
('80', 349, 0, 1, 550151) 350 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 349, 1, 2, 550193) On the contrary it is his clear duty, and of those whom he mayselect, to refrain so long as he and they feel that they can contribute their mite to the attempt to eradicate goondaism.
('80', 349, 1, 3, 550377) There remains the question of those who were prematurely released owing to the Punjab High Court decision about the insufficiency for the purpose of conviction of mere notices to offer civil disobedience.
('80', 349, 1, 4, 550582) When I learnt about the decision, I had informed Mian Saheb that he should not be in a hurry to send them to jail and that when he paid his contemplated visit to Sevagram I should discuss the question with him and decide.
('80', 349, 1, 5, 550804) He came and I advised that those who were not wanted for the peace move should re offer civil disobedience.

('80', 349, 5, 17, 551252) But it was only a preliminary talk.
('80', 349, 5, 18, 551288) He said he would come again.

('80', 349, 5, 20, 551368) Nandan ought to give me his opinion about Farooqi especially as he is a Delhi man.

('80', 350, 1, 4, 552115) And I had told you that I would not feel at ease using that paper.
('80', 350, 1, 5, 552182) His bill, as it was, was a true bill.
('80', 350, 1, 6, 552220) He would exact that price from any other customer.
('80', 350, 1, 7, 552271) But there is no hurry about a final decision.

('80', 353, 7, 29, 557092) It is also proper that Munnalal has begged for pardon.
('80', 353, 7, 30, 557147) But Munnalal’s views are wrong on many things.
('80', 353, 7, 31, 557194) No one can be unworthy of living in an institution.
('80', 353, 7, 32, 557246) The world itself is an institution.
('80', 353, 7, 33, 557282) Can anybody stay outside it?
('80', 353, 7, 34, 557311) The family is also an institution.
('80', 353, 7, 35, 557346) It is a sub institution; and in between the world and the family are institutions like ours.
('80', 353, 7, 36, 557439) All are imperfect.
('80', 353, 7, 37, 557458) The world is also imperfect.

('80', 354, 3, 9, 558066) Jivrambhai’s money has been lying in different places.
('80', 354, 3, 10, 558121) What do they propose to do about it?
('80', 354, 3, 11, 558158) Who will manage the Ashram?
('80', 354, 3, 12, 558186) I should like it if Nathibai came here.
('80', 354, 3, 13, 558226) Give her the letter meant for her.
('80', 354, 3, 14, 558261) Some memorial ought to be erected at the spot where Jivrambhai was cremated.
('80', 354, 3, 15, 558338) Let me know if you have thought about anything.
('80', 354, 3, 16, 558386) Where was he cremated?
('80', 354, 3, 17, 558409) Have you preserved any portion of the ashes, or did you immerse the whole of them into the sea?
('80', 354, 3, 18, 558505) We whom Jivrambhai has left behind will have been worthy of him when the seeds which he sowed grow into big trees.

('80', 354, 8, 24, 558799) You ought not to think of going to jail until you are completely free from the complaint.

('80', 355, 2, 3, 559231) July 11, 1941
('80', 355, 3, 4, 559245) MUNNALAL, Even a person who becomes perfect as a man does not become God.
('80', 355, 3, 5, 559319) Even Krishna the man died a miserable death.
('80', 355, 3, 6, 559364) 1 He may have been the best among men but was not God.
('80', 355, 3, 7, 559419) Just as a frog may become the highest among frogs, so a man may be the highest among men.
('80', 355, 3, 8, 559509) Any institution, therefore, created by man is bound to be imperfect.
('80', 355, 3, 9, 559578) If, however, you feel unhappy in this institution, you must leave it.
('80', 355, 3, 10, 559648) I merely wanted to say that what you had stated about all institutions was based on ignorance.
('80', 355, 4, 11, 559743) I would certainly welcome your staying in another institution, namely, the family.
('80', 355, 4, 12, 559826) That is what poor Kanchan wants.
('80', 355, 4, 13, 559859) She has not known the joys of family life.
('80', 355, 4, 14, 559902) Make her happy and let her feel satisfied.
('80', 355, 4, 15, 559945) Here we do have freedom.
('80', 355, 4, 16, 559970) I am certain that you will enjoy nowhere else the freedom that you do here.
('80', 355, 4, 17, 560046) If you reflect over the matter, you will see that you cannot tolerate in others the freedom that you want for yourself.
('80', 355, 4, 18, 560166) Cariappa was certainly at fault in refusing to do anything, but you should have respected his freedom to do that.
('80', 355, 4, 19, 560280) Likewise, you should respect Chimanlal’s freedom not to keep Nimbarkar, just as he should respect your freedom to express your opinion.
('80', 355, 4, 20, 560416) Whether justice or injustice is being done to Nimbarkar is for me to see.

('80', 356, 6, 20, 561783) Moreover, all those who have to go to jail will have their chance.

('80', 361, 6, 11, 568084) Mahadev is in Delhi.
('80', 361, 6, 12, 568105) He has to wander about just now.
('80', 361, 6, 13, 568138) Why this hankering?
('80', 361, 6, 14, 568158) True friendship does not require meeting or even letter writing.
('80', 361, 6, 15, 568223) Why not just treasure silent love?

('80', 362, 3, 5, 568839) By all means satisfy it.
('80', 362, 3, 6, 568864) Your being the Secretary 1 will not come in your way.
('80', 362, 3, 7, 568918) Ghanshyamdas and you have come together as co workers and this union cannot be dissolved except by death.
('80', 362, 3, 8, 569024) He needs—and so do I—your moral strength and your dedication.
('80', 362, 3, 9, 569086) Your Secretaryship is but an indication of that.
('80', 362, 3, 10, 569135) I don’t think you will want to give up the Secretaryship even when you are free to give to the Adivasis as much time as you wish despite your being the Secretary.
('80', 362, 3, 11, 569298) For your sake we held back Vaidyanatha Iyer with just a line.
('80', 362, 3, 12, 569360) Surely it was not as if the others would not have worked.
('80', 362, 3, 13, 569418) But we want the moral strength of saintly men for washing off this sin.
('80', 362, 3, 14, 569490) Please do not forget that the evil of untouchability is being practised in the name of religion.
('80', 362, 3, 15, 569587) The Adivasis, however, suffer from no such bar.

('80', 365, 5, 17, 574084) DEAR SISTER, Your questions are good.
('80', 365, 5, 18, 574122) In non violent war, to mix poison in water or to burn grains, oil, etc., are forbidden, and should be so.
('80', 365, 5, 19, 574228) It is one thing to non co operate with the enemy and quite another to stop water, etc., to harm him.
('80', 365, 5, 20, 574329) The non co operator accepts suffering for himself.
('80', 365, 5, 21, 574380) For example, a lawyer will starve because ofnon co operation.
('80', 365, 5, 22, 574442) Motilalji 1 sacrificed lakhs of rupees.

('80', 365, 5, 24, 574514) Men working in offices gave up their jobs.
('80', 365, 5, 25, 574557) We are not going to run away from the invaders and if we do so, unable to bear the sufferings, we would leave our property as the Dukhobors 2
('80', 365, 6, 26, 574699) had done in Russia.
('80', 365, 6, 27, 574719) In following ahimsa there is no question of ever doing what Stalin was obliged to do.
('80', 365, 6, 28, 574805) A satyagrahi is not to protect his property, instead he may give up his life.
('80', 365, 6, 29, 574883) A satyagrahi should be a non possessor and he can defend others by being so.
('80', 365, 6, 30, 574960) That is why I said that Englishmen may lose England but not their self respect.
('80', 365, 6, 31, 575040) To save his self respect while doing no harm to his enemy, a satyagrahi has, for the time being, to allow his property to be looted.
('80', 365, 6, 32, 575173) Anyway in a violent war too he would, on being defeated, lose his property.

('80', 368, 6, 12, 578958) You deserve rest after 40 years’ unbroken service.
('80', 368, 6, 13, 579009) As to your views on non violence, satyagraha, etc., we have to tolerate one another’s differences of opinion.

('80', 369, 6, 12, 580185) I do not feel like saying anything.
('80', 369, 6, 13, 580221) In such matters I have always given the first place to Jawaharlal’s views and he is not here.
('80', 369, 6, 14, 580315) His policy has been the policy of the Congress.
('80', 369, 6, 15, 580363) Since he is in prison my mind does not work at all.
('80', 369, 6, 16, 580415) Russia is not a country like Spain or China.

('80', 369, 6, 18, 580505) I find a great difference between Lenin and Stalin.
('80', 369, 6, 19, 580557) Lenin’s Russia is no more.
('80', 369, 6, 20, 580584) But this is going into the merits and shortcomings.
('80', 369, 6, 21, 580636) I may be wrong in my observation.

('80', 371, 5, 8, 582684) As to Mr. Munshi 1, my position is clear.
('80', 371, 5, 9, 582726) When he could not conform to the explicit resolution 2 of the Congress on internal disorders, I had no option but to advise him to leave.
('80', 371, 5, 10, 582864) 3 I cannot be held responsible for what he does after severing his connection with the Congress.
('80', 371, 5, 11, 582961) Those who know me understand that such influence as I can exert on Shri Munshi must still be on the side of non violence.
('80', 371, 5, 12, 583083) Those who do not trust me impute motives to me which I can only disprove by my conduct.
('80', 371, 5, 13, 583171) As to the workers, they are bound by the Congress resolution I have quoted in my letter to Shri Munshi.
('80', 371, 5, 14, 583275) The Congress policy binds them to non violence in the struggle with the Government as also in dealing with communal riots and the like.

('80', 374, 5, 19, 587150) Your letter forms part of it.
('80', 374, 5, 20, 587180) The question of the Soviet Union is too deep for you to unders tand.
('80', 374, 5, 21, 587249) In this matter I have appointed Jawaharlal my captain.

('80', 374, 5, 24, 587401) Today’s Russia is not the Russia of Lenin.
('80', 374, 5, 25, 587444) And Russia is not a small country.

('80', 374, 5, 29, 587679) How can those who stand for a free India speak in the matter?
('80', 374, 5, 30, 587741) Such are my difficulties.

('80', 375, 3, 4, 588287) LILI, Your complaint is justified.
('80', 375, 3, 5, 588322) I was caught in a very heavy schedule of work.
('80', 375, 3, 6, 588369) Now there is hope of a little respite.
('80', 375, 3, 7, 588408) You have deliberately spoilt your health.
('80', 375, 3, 8, 588450) You used to have a sense of balance.
('80', 375, 3, 9, 588487) Now eat well and improve your health.
('80', 375, 3, 10, 588525) Keep me fully posted.
('80', 375, 3, 11, 588547) Mahadev will have given you the razor.
('80', 375, 3, 12, 588586) Clean it by applying oil on it.
('80', 375, 3, 13, 588618) Now you may have to give up tea.
('80', 375, 3, 14, 588651) I shall not be able to tolerate even slow or any other type of fever or ailment.
('80', 375, 3, 15, 588732) Your good health should never be spoilt.

('80', 376, 2, 3, 589436) July 20, 1941 What you say in your letter 1 is true.
('80', 376, 2, 4, 589489) Don’t be eager to go to Wardha for marketing.
('80', 376, 2, 5, 589535) You may do that when you are all right, for you have a special aptitude for it.
('80', 376, 2, 6, 589615) For the present, follow my advice and confine yourself to work in the farm— within the limits of your strength.
('80', 376, 2, 7, 589727) That will restore your health.
('80', 376, 2, 8, 589758) Give up all worries.
('80', 376, 2, 9, 589779) Live chiefly on milk and curds.
('80', 376, 2, 10, 589811) Eat whatever fruit you can get.
('80', 376, 2, 11, 589843) Eat very little of bread, but eat greens in plenty.
('80', 376, 2, 12, 589895) Your second letter is fine.
('80', 376, 2, 13, 589923) The best way of winning people’s trust is through selfless work and service.
('80', 376, 2, 14, 590000) The secret of this lies in “seeing oneself in all creatures”.
('80', 376, 2, 15, 590062) If this truth abides in your heart, nothing will make you unhappy.
('80', 376, 2, 16, 590129) My plan regarding your expenses is this.
('80', 376, 2, 17, 590170) I wish to draw from the money Iying in your name for all extraordinary expenses till the amount is exhausted.
('80', 376, 2, 18, 590280) You two will begin to progress rapidly only when it is fully exhausted.
('80', 376, 2, 19, 590352) As long as the money is there, interest in possession will remain and you will continue to harbour the sense of proprietorship.
('80', 376, 2, 20, 590480) Though it is true that both of you have practically gifted away the money, the knowledge that you own it does you harm.
('80', 376, 2, 21, 590600) If you do not understand this distinction, ask me.
('80', 376, 2, 22, 590651) Let not the arrival of Kanchan disturb your peace of mind in the least.
('80', 376, 2, 23, 590723) It is indeed a good thing that she has come.
('80', 376, 2, 24, 590768) Stop regarding her as your property.
('80', 376, 2, 25, 590805) You may start living as husband and wife after some time, but if you accept her right to enjoy the same freedom that you do, you will not get angry with her for anything she does.
('80', 376, 2, 26, 590985) You may let her serve you, but you must not feel in the least offended if she does not do that to the extent you would like her to do.
('80', 376, 2, 27, 591120) You wish to win her trust, too, don’t you?
('80', 376, 2, 28, 591163) Please remember that unbroken cheerfulness is the most important condition for your keeping good health.

('80', 377, 8, 17, 592028) DEAR SIR RADHAKRISHNAN 1, I see that in your deep and extensive studies the art of begging formed no part.
('80', 377, 8, 18, 592135) Malaviyaji is unequalled in that art.
('80', 377, 8, 19, 592173) You will be begging in his name.
('80', 377, 8, 20, 592206) Do you suppose that my recommendation can carry greater weight?
('80', 377, 8, 21, 592270) Your innate modesty disables you from seeing that you cannot need any introduction from me.
('80', 377, 8, 22, 592362) Some of the friends you mention I have probably not even met.
('80', 377, 8, 23, 592424) Anyway, if my recommendation is of the slightest use, please use this letter and tell the friends whom you meet that I regard it as the duty of monied men to free Malaviyaji Maharaj from the anxiety about the B.H.U. by subscribing liberally towards the payment of the debt referred to by you.
('80', 377, 8, 24, 592717) I do hope that your mission will be wholly successful.
('80', 377, 8, 25, 592772) You know that you will be welcome whenever you can come.
('80', 377, 8, 26, 592829) Sundaram has been the University Collector.

('80', 379, 7, 19, 595511) You should, therefore, render to the poorest among them whatever silent service is possible.
('80', 379, 7, 20, 595604) Such service is bound to bear fruit.
('80', 379, 7, 21, 595641) It was with this idea that I made the suggestion about one or two boys.
('80', 379, 7, 22, 595713) While training them, you also will get trained and will learn the art of serving people.
('80', 379, 7, 23, 595802) Let our way of living produce whatever effect it can on the panchayat.
('80', 379, 7, 24, 595873) I shall certainly talk to Krishnadas and Chimanlal, but everything will depend on your being frank and gentle.

('80', 380, 6, 13, 596748) Now he need not do any fixed work.
('80', 380, 6, 14, 596783) He may, therefore, stay either with Krishna[das] 2 here or with Prabhudas 3 or with you at Rajkot.
('80', 380, 6, 15, 596882) Kashi 4, too, will be able to live independently.

('80', 381, 5, 8, 597980) July 21, 1941
('80', 381, 6, 9, 597994) BHAI DILKHUSH, I have carefully gone through Kantan Praveshika 1. The title is not appropriate.
('80', 381, 6, 10, 598090) The book is not a praveshika.
('80', 381, 6, 11, 598120) It offers useful suggestions to those who have become acquainted with the subject.
('80', 381, 6, 12, 598203) I would, therefore, call it Kantanarne Upayogi Soochano 2 or simply Kantanarne.
('80', 381, 6, 13, 598283) Your instructions are incomplete in some ways.
('80', 381, 6, 14, 598330) You have assumed that the spinner can tell when a spindle is bent or can judge about the point.
('80', 381, 6, 15, 598426) My experience is that 95 spinners out of a hundred cannot do that.
('80', 381, 6, 16, 598493) You should, therefore, explain what a bent spindle and a good point are.
('80', 381, 6, 17, 598566) You should similarly explain about slivers, etc.
('80', 381, 6, 18, 598615) The third and easiest method of determining the count of yarn is not what you have suggested.
('80', 381, 6, 19, 598709) The count is equal to the number of rounds in one anna weight of yarn.
('80', 381, 6, 20, 598780) The method you have explained does of course include this, but a beginner will not be able to see this.
('80', 381, 6, 21, 598884) I found from experience that the method suggested by me was the best.
('80', 381, 6, 22, 598954) I hit upon it while trying, day after day, to determine the count of my yarn in Yeravda.
('80', 381, 7, 23, 599043) You have suggested the use of cocoanut oil.
('80', 381, 7, 24, 599087) My experience is that it smells and also attracts ants.
('80', 381, 7, 25, 599143) I used to mix with cocoanut oil one fourth or a little more of kerosene.
('80', 381, 7, 26, 599216) This keeps away ants and less of dirt gets mixed with the oil.
('80', 381, 7, 27, 599279) From the above you will be able to think for yourself about other revisions.

('80', 382, 6, 10, 599858) It is surprising that you have not received the letters.
('80', 382, 6, 11, 599915) This letter is also being sent at the same address.
('80', 382, 6, 12, 599967) I hope your going to another hospital will not make any difference.
('80', 382, 6, 13, 600035) Enclosed is a letter from Dr. Gopichand addressed to you.
('80', 382, 6, 14, 600093) Here too the rains have stopped, and hence the days are hot.
('80', 382, 6, 15, 600154) The nights are lovely.

('80', 382, 6, 20, 600320) He has been fasting since yesterday and has taken saline.
('80', 382, 6, 21, 600378) Veeramma drank potassium permanganate in a fit of anger.
('80', 382, 6, 22, 600435) 1 It was immediately discovered.
('80', 382, 6, 23, 600468) She was given lime to drink and made to vomit.

('80', 383, 10, 25, 601839) Both of them can be said to have forgotten their duty.

('80', 384, 1, 2, 602007) onreading your letter, I almost felt like weeping.
('80', 384, 1, 3, 602058) You started writing by dipping your pen into a cup of venom and poured out the whole of it in the end.
('80', 384, 1, 4, 602161) Why all this?
('80', 384, 1, 5, 602175) I was sure that Dr. Arundale would come over.
('80', 384, 1, 6, 602221) Had he come, he would have certainly spoken in English.
('80', 384, 1, 7, 602277) It was with hesitation that I permitted Vishwanathdas to speak in English but I would have gladly permitted Dr. Arundale.
('80', 384, 1, 8, 602399) You just cannot have any concrete reason to doubt this.
('80', 384, 1, 9, 602455) I have no hostility towards Dr. Arundale nor towards any Englishman.
('80', 384, 1, 10, 602524) I had none against General Dyer and I was a worshipper of Mrs. Annie Besant.
('80', 384, 1, 11, 602601) Perhaps you might not have been born when I began to idolize her.
('80', 384, 1, 12, 602667) This was in 1889 90. I beg your pardon if you were born about this time.
('80', 384, 1, 13, 602740) I do not remember at all about the meeting where Shri Iyengar was present.
('80', 384, 1, 14, 602815) Why should I oppose putting up a statue of Mrs. Annie Besant?
('80', 384, 1, 15, 602877) I do not remember anything at all.
('80', 384, 1, 16, 602912) I shall be obliged if you will give me the evidence you have.
('80', 384, 1, 17, 602974) In the end you have exceeded the limits.
('80', 384, 1, 18, 603015) You have insulted the English language the way you have abused your own people.
('80', 384, 1, 19, 603095) Perhaps you could not have poured out so much venom in Gujarati.
('80', 384, 1, 20, 603160) As I have good relations with your family, your letter has shocked me.
('80', 384, 1, 21, 603231) Your letter is full of rudeness and ignorance.

('80', 384, 6, 33, 603724) I think whatever may have been decided about Pyarelal’s stay there, etc., is appropriate.

('80', 385, 6, 12, 604261) BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS,
('80', 385, 7, 13, 604280) I finished reading Bapu Just now.
('80', 385, 7, 14, 604314) At two or three places the facts are wrong though they do not detract from the views expressed.
('80', 385, 7, 15, 604410) I have marked the passages.
('80', 385, 7, 16, 604438) Of course you can always put forward your own arguments about the calf incident 4. But I findsome fundamental defect in it.
('80', 385, 7, 17, 604562) The killing of the calf has no similarity with the killing of Ravana and so on.
('80', 385, 7, 18, 604642) I had no self interest in killing the calf, the only motive was to free it from pain.
('80', 385, 7, 19, 604728) Primarily there was self interest in the killing of Ravana and so on.
('80', 385, 7, 20, 604798) There was burden on the earth and it had to be lightened.
('80', 385, 7, 21, 604856) His destroyer was God in the form of Rama.
('80', 385, 7, 22, 604899) Here the destroyer was no supposed incarnation.
('80', 385, 7, 23, 604947) I hold that everyone in my situation can do what I did.
('80', 385, 7, 24, 605003) Inspired and encouraged by me, Ambalal killed forty dogs.
('80', 385, 7, 25, 605061) There was however some material advantage.
('80', 385, 7, 26, 605104) But there is a lot of difference between the killing of Ravana and so on and this.
('80', 385, 7, 27, 605187) And I have given a special meaning to these things.
('80', 385, 7, 28, 605239) A discussion of it was necessary there.
('80', 385, 7, 29, 605279) More about it on another occasion if considered necessary.
('80', 385, 7, 30, 605338) The language is sweet.

('80', 386, 5, 8, 605907) July 22, 1941
('80', 386, 6, 9, 605921) When I asked Gandhiji, who was at work on his charkha when I called on him, whether he had read the communique 1, he said he had not and asked me to read it.
('80', 386, 6, 10, 606079) With his hands busy operating his charkha, stopping only now and then to wind the thread, Gandhiji listened as I read the communique including the personnel of the National Defence Council.
('80', 386, 6, 11, 606269) When I concluded reading, Gandhiji looked up and, laughing loudly, asked whether I had finished.
('80', 386, 6, 12, 606366) I said I had, and asked him whether he wished to say anything.
('80', 386, 6, 13, 606429) Gandhiji said that he had no statement to make and added: I would rather observe silence, Monday silence, whatever it may mean and you can say so in the papers.
('80', 386, 7, 14, 606590) When I asked him whether it could be taken that he was not interested in the announcement, he said: I can’t say so.
('80', 386, 7, 15, 606706) That will be pedantic.
('80', 386, 8, 16, 606729) Then I handed him a sheet of paper containing a few questions drafted by me earlier.
('80', 386, 8, 17, 606814) Gandhiji read the questions and remarked: I can answer some of these questions.
('80', 386, 8, 18, 606894) But I don’t know what purpose it will serve.
('80', 386, 9, 19, 606939) Pressed further to say whatever he wished, Gandhiji replied to my first question, whether the Government of India’s announcement affected the stand taken by the Congress and whether it met the Congress demand to any extent.
('80', 386, 9, 20, 607163) The announcement does not affect the stand taken by the Congress; nor does it meet the Congress demand to any extent.
('80', 386, 10, 21, 607281) To my next question whether the members of the A.I.C.C., if released from jail, will be permitted to consider the present situation in the light of recent
('80', 386, 11, 22, 607436) 1 Issued by the Government of India on July 21 from Simla announcing the expansion of the Viceroy’s Executive Council and the formation of a National Defence Council.

('80', 387, 1, 2, 607645) developments in the country, Gandhiji replied: I understand you to mean whether I shall permit A.I.C.C. members, if they are released, to consider the present situation.
('80', 387, 1, 3, 607815) If that is the meaning of your question, I can at once say that I have no authority to prevent members of the A.I.C.C. from doing anything they wish.
('80', 387, 1, 4, 607965) The authority given to me by the A.I.C.C. does not permit my interference with the fullest freedom of its members.
('80', 387, 1, 5, 608080) And in any case the body that gave me the authority can at any time refuse it or withdraw it.
('80', 387, 1, 6, 608174) I certainly consider the demand made by the Mysore Legislative Council 1 as not only modest but any day opportune.
('80', 387, 2, 7, 608289) When I asked him whether the present situation in the country was an opportune one for embarking on the programme, Gandhiji added: As a matter of fact it should have been made long ago.
('80', 387, 2, 8, 608475) The present situation in the country cannot be allowed to interfere with elementary justice being done to Harijans.
('80', 387, 3, 9, 608591) When I asked him whether non arrest of satyagrahis shouting anti war slogans can be construed, as some people seemed to, as amounting to grant of liberty to preach against war, Gandhiji said: There is no warrant for the belief implied in the opinion.
('80', 387, 3, 10, 608842) Some Provincial Governments have clearly stated that they do not want to arrest unimportant members.
('80', 387, 3, 11, 608943) But they are arresting those whom they consider important enough if they recite anti war slogans.

('80', 388, 13, 25, 611037) Please find herewith your memo of the interview with Gandhiji as corrected by him.
('80', 388, 13, 26, 611120) It is common ground that it is for personal record.” Kishorelal Mashruwala was present during the interview.

('80', 389, 1, 2, 611271) time is gone.
('80', 389, 1, 3, 611285) I mention to him the restlessness that is becoming evident in the country, and if the Congress were not to revise its stand, it may lose ground.
('80', 389, 1, 4, 611430) To this he said that even if the Congress were to find itself in the desert, it would prefer to be there, to sacrificing the country’s interest and humorously said that sometimes the desert air did good.
('80', 389, 1, 5, 611634) I mentioned to him that by the withdrawal of the Congress ministry, the little good that was attempted to be done had to be given up.
('80', 389, 1, 6, 611768) He replied that weighing matters in the proper way, it was not worth while to put much emphasis on the attempted progress, when considerations far weightier were at stake.
('80', 389, 1, 7, 611940) When Congress was out to put down imperialism, all these things were insignificant.
('80', 389, 1, 8, 612024) Even if the Congress gave up non violence, it had been found that as a purely political measure, the Poona resolution could not be revived.

('80', 389, 11, 27, 612774) I have found you to be weak in action and that out of your overgoodness.

('80', 390, 1, 2, 612932) weakness.
('80', 390, 1, 3, 612942) It means a disposition not to offend people even at the cost of suppression of truth.
('80', 390, 1, 4, 613028) My firm advice to you is that you should talk to Mian Saheb 1 with the utmost candour and he will respond.
('80', 390, 1, 5, 613135) If he has suspicion he will tell you so.
('80', 390, 1, 6, 613176) He is young and in experienced but straight and brave.
('80', 390, 1, 7, 613231) This is my analysis of him.
('80', 390, 1, 8, 613259) You should have gone to Solan and Simla.
('80', 390, 1, 9, 613300) When he definitely asked you not to go to Manorlal, it was well to respect his wishes.
('80', 390, 1, 10, 613387) But you were not bound always to carry out his wishes except in strict Congress matters.
('80', 390, 1, 11, 613476) Youmust build up your opinions and enforce them when enforcement becomes a duty.
('80', 390, 1, 12, 613557) It is wrong to seek imprisonment in order to gain relief from squabbles or suspicion fancied or real of one’s chief.
('80', 390, 1, 13, 613674) Such imprisonment is harmful.
('80', 390, 2, 14, 613704) I refrain from guiding you in the matters referred to by you, till you have become even with Mian Saheb.
('80', 390, 2, 15, 613809) If you have really forfeited his confidence, my advice would be for you to retire from the Congress activities without any fuss.
('80', 390, 2, 16, 613938) You have ample other useful work.
('80', 390, 2, 17, 613972) Men like you cannot work half heartedly or under shadow of mistrust or suspicion.
('80', 390, 2, 18, 614054) I have not heard from Mian Saheb at all for weeks now.
('80', 390, 2, 19, 614109) I do not think I had anything from him save one letter to Rajkumari after the last visit.

('80', 391, 3, 4, 614470) DEAR MR. STIMSON, Here are my answers : 1. No modification necessary.
('80', 391, 3, 5, 614540) My advice to the Russians would be precisely the same as to the British.
('80', 391, 3, 6, 614613) It is a cruel misrepresentation of my advice to the British to say that it was one of non resistance.
('80', 391, 3, 7, 614715) I suggested non violent resistance which is any day superior to violent, blood thirsty resistance.
('80', 391, 3, 8, 614814) 2. I am entirely satisfied with the progress and achievements of my limited non cooperation campaign as you call it and which I describe as civil disobedience.
('80', 391, 3, 9, 614974) 3. It is a difficult question to answer definitely.
('80', 391, 3, 10, 615026) But I do not mind it being said that the majority are non violent only out of policy.
('80', 391, 3, 11, 615112) That is the weakest part of my campaign but it is inevitable.
('80', 391, 3, 12, 615174) In spite of the appearances to the contrary it is my belief that true non violence is growing among the people.
('80', 391, 3, 13, 615286) 4. I have no doubt whatsoever that in spite of the riots, etc.
('80', 391, 3, 14, 615349) India will have the moral strength and unity to forge her own destiny in her own way.
('80', 391, 3, 15, 615435) Twenty years of solid work cannot be a waste.
('80', 391, 3, 16, 615481) I hope you can decipher my writing and that if you publish my reply, it will be published as it is, in toto.

('80', 391, 6, 20, 615713) 1 An Associated Press correspondent had sought Gandhiji’s views on the following points : (i) whether Gandhiji’s policy of non violence advocated to the British would apply to Russians also, or would it need any modification; (ii) whether Gandhiji was satisfied with the progress of non cooperation; (iii) how many of his followers really believed in non violence; (iv) whether in view of the widespread rioting in the country, India could still have the unity and strength to forge her own destiny.

('80', 392, 3, 4, 616325) DEAR SHEIKH SAHEB, You have my apology.
('80', 392, 3, 5, 616365) You had, I thought, always told me that you were a soldier and I was your general.
('80', 392, 3, 6, 616448) I see I misunderstood you.
('80', 392, 3, 7, 616475) I now understand your complaint about Kashmir.
('80', 392, 3, 8, 616522) I asked Badshah Khan who is with me and he supports me.
('80', 392, 3, 9, 616578) He vividly recollects the grief he in common with me felt over your obstinacy in opposing my wish to be the state guest not for my pleasure but for the sake of the people of Kashmir.
('80', 392, 3, 10, 616761) 1 You should know that I cancelled the visit to Kashmir simply to please you.
('80', 392, 3, 11, 616839) I changed overnight for I learnt that if I came as the people’s guest the Durbar would take it amiss.
('80', 392, 3, 12, 616941) I thought that I could take the liberty I took with my followers as I deemed you to be in altering my plans.
('80', 392, 3, 13, 617050) But now I see that you were only trying me before becoming my follower.
('80', 392, 3, 14, 617122) I am sorry I failed in your test.
('80', 392, 3, 15, 617156) Now about the Kashmir position.
('80', 392, 3, 16, 617188) I had no difficulty in giving my provisional opinion about the script.
('80', 392, 3, 17, 617259) You have put before me an intricate problem on which I dare not give even a provisional opinion.
('80', 392, 3, 18, 617356) I appreciate your frankness.
('80', 392, 3, 19, 617385) I hope you will find no want of it in my reply.

('80', 404, 5, 7, 633268) July 28, 1941
('80', 404, 6, 8, 633282) KRISHNACHANDRA, The tone of Balvantsinha’s letter did not suggest [that the refuse] was burnt out of enmity.
('80', 404, 6, 9, 633391) His letter expresses nothing but grief.
('80', 404, 6, 10, 633431) Almost all the refuse is manure except broken glass.
('80', 404, 6, 11, 633484) I feel that what Balvantsinha says is correct; it would have been better to have asked him before getting the refuse burnt.
('80', 404, 6, 12, 633608) When he had asked for help, it should have been given.
('80', 404, 6, 13, 633663) It is true that a farmer would be deeply hurt if his manure is burnt.
('80', 404, 6, 14, 633733) Try to pacify Balvantsinha.

('80', 404, 11, 20, 633929) She wanted me to add something.
('80', 404, 11, 21, 633961) But the letter was posted by mistake.
('80', 404, 11, 22, 633999) What she meant was that I also should give you comfort regarding the illness of the children.
('80', 404, 11, 23, 634093) But now the children are all right.
('80', 404, 11, 24, 634129) And even if they are not, what comfort do you need?
('80', 404, 11, 25, 634181) We are all in the hands of God.
('80', 404, 11, 26, 634213) Yes, it is our duty to try our best, and that you are already doing.

('80', 405, 7, 9, 634766) I was very clear in my reply.
('80', 405, 7, 10, 634796) 1 But being confused in mind you find it vague.
('80', 405, 7, 11, 634844) My advice is that you should firmly decide to stay here and be content with doing whatever work is given you.
('80', 405, 7, 12, 634954) This is the royal road and the royal yoga.
('80', 405, 7, 13, 634997) If you cannot do that, you may go on a tour and return if and when you feel tired.
('80', 405, 7, 14, 635080) Don’t carry any worry with you.

('80', 406, 7, 12, 635877) Your two letters came in together.
('80', 406, 7, 13, 635912) So you see it works the same way at both ends.
('80', 406, 7, 14, 635959) We must suffer these little pricks of life.
('80', 406, 7, 15, 636003) If Jamnalal must leave earlier, he must not be prevented.

('80', 406, 13, 22, 636253) You need stay there only as long as you wish to.
('80', 406, 13, 23, 636302) Far from envying you, I would welcome your cultivating a closer relationship with that family than I enjoy.
('80', 406, 13, 24, 636410) But how do you hope to cultivate a relationship like mine when from the very beginning you feel afraid even to stay there?
('80', 406, 13, 25, 636533) You should have no objection to staying there as long as Rajkumari is there.
('80', 406, 13, 26, 636610) But do as you like.
('80', 406, 13, 27, 636630) It would be certainly good if you meet Jawaharlal.

('80', 408, 3, 5, 638155) Where was the time?
('80', 408, 3, 6, 638175) I did tell him to see me at four but he did not want to say anything.
('80', 408, 3, 7, 638245) I think I had replied to Bhai Kotwal.
('80', 408, 3, 8, 638283) I do not in the least relish the idea of his going to jail 1. And there is absolutely no need to come here.
('80', 408, 3, 9, 638391) Why should he at all go to jail?
('80', 408, 3, 10, 638424) Let him do whatever constructive work he can in Indore.
('80', 408, 3, 11, 638480) If he does not get my letter, he should consider this my reply to him.
('80', 408, 3, 12, 638551) Mishrilal has lost much weight.
('80', 408, 3, 13, 638583) Now he should take it easy.

('80', 408, 8, 26, 639115) DEAR SIR, This is the concluding portion of your leaderette 2 in The Times of India, [of the] 29th instant:
('80', 408, 9, 27, 639223) Either he has been lax in interpreting his own rules of satyagraha or he has been deceived by the majority of those whose names were submitted.
('80', 408, 9, 28, 639367) Mr. Gandhi can best say which of these alternatives is the right one.
('80', 408, 10, 29, 639437) 1 The source here adds “in Ajmer”; vide “Letter to Kotwal”, 7 8 1941 2 Vide “Letter from Subhas Chandra Bose”, 23 12 1940.

('80', 409, 1, 2, 639602) I suggest a third alternative.
('80', 409, 1, 3, 639633) I have neither been lax in the interpretation of my rules of satyagraha nor have I been deceived by anybody.
('80', 409, 1, 4, 639742) You have omitted to read one sentence in my admissions: “It is inevitable.” From the very inception of the movement in 1920 non violence has been a policy and not a creed.
('80', 409, 1, 5, 639914) I said 1 in Bombay speaking at the A.I.C.C. meeting on the reversal of the Poona resolution that with the majority non violence was a policy.
('80', 409, 1, 6, 640056) The weak ness was therefore inherent in the movement.
('80', 409, 1, 7, 640110) It should not be for gotten that I am trying the great experiment of using non violence for the political freedom of the country.
('80', 409, 1, 8, 640240) With me no doubt non violence is an end in itself, though it is also a means for the attainment of the freedom of the country.
('80', 409, 1, 9, 640367) With the vast majority of Congressmen it is and must remain a means.
('80', 409, 1, 10, 640436) The weakness is thus inherent though none the less regrettable.
('80', 409, 1, 11, 640500) The marvel is that in spite of the weakness, twenty years’ experience has not weaned Congressmen from the non violent policy, though it is open to it to change it any time.
('80', 409, 1, 12, 640673) In the light of the information I have provided, you will perhaps admit that the case you have made up against the Congress and me falls to the ground.
('80', 409, 3, 13, 640825) Yours sincerely,

('80', 409, 7, 25, 641278) He returned that.
('80', 409, 7, 26, 641296) Mine looked like advertisement and he did not see any use in seeing me again.

('80', 411, 4, 12, 643289) Now the diet will consist of curds, milk, leafy vegetables, sour lime, etc.
('80', 411, 4, 13, 643365) I am of course well.
('80', 411, 4, 14, 643386) Khan Saheb has arrived.
('80', 411, 4, 15, 643410) He is all right.
('80', 411, 4, 16, 643427) Most probably he will leave on Sunday.
('80', 411, 4, 17, 643466) He is likely to reach there on Monday.
('80', 411, 4, 18, 643505) Ask Devdas to take the car to fetch him.

('80', 411, 9, 25, 643725) SUSHILA, After you went, you must have received one letter followed by a postcard.
('80', 411, 9, 26, 643808) Enclosed is the strange letter from Sankaran which you must read and preserve.
('80', 411, 9, 27, 643887) Annapurna’s fear proved right.
('80', 411, 9, 28, 643918) Sankaran has worked very hard.
('80', 411, 9, 29, 643949) He is well educated.
('80', 411, 9, 30, 643970) But women remain his obsession.
('80', 411, 9, 31, 644002) I cannot decide what can be done about it.
('80', 411, 9, 32, 644045) I do not want to

('80', 412, 1, 3, 644243) I shall see about it.
('80', 412, 1, 4, 644265) But it is necessary that you should be kept informed.
('80', 412, 1, 5, 644319) My blood pressure continues to be satisfactory at the previous level.
('80', 412, 1, 6, 644389) It seems it was unnecessary for me to take the salted limes that I had been taking.
('80', 412, 1, 7, 644473) Within four day, after I gave up taking the limes, the blood pressure started coming down.
('80', 412, 1, 8, 644564) At all the three readings yesterday it was between 150/90. It had considerably gone down the day before yesterday also.
('80', 412, 1, 9, 644684) Of course, I had been working very hard.
('80', 412, 1, 10, 644725) Tari is still here.
('80', 412, 1, 11, 644745) She will most probably go to the Bal Kutir tomorrow.
('80', 412, 1, 12, 644798) It will be some time before it gets vacated.
('80', 412, 2, 13, 644843) Madalasa is doing fine.
('80', 412, 2, 14, 644867) Mahesh’s 1 pain seems to have gone now.

('80', 412, 3, 17, 644999) She is feeling quite energetic.
('80', 412, 4, 18, 645031) Your letter was received today.
('80', 412, 4, 19, 645063) Kaka’s urine was found to contain sugar and acetone.

('80', 414, 6, 14, 647078) I know Khan Saheb’s nature.
('80', 414, 6, 15, 647106) He would surely expect that I should talk when he comes.
('80', 414, 6, 16, 647163) There certainly had been a mistake, it occurs to me as I write this.
('80', 414, 6, 17, 647232) He was to arrive in themorning, and so it would have been all right if I had started talking later.
('80', 414, 6, 18, 647332) As it happened, I was having my massage when he arrived.
('80', 414, 6, 19, 647389) He could not wait the while and barged in while the massage was going on and engaged me in talk.
('80', 414, 6, 20, 647486) Love is a remarkable bond.
('80', 414, 6, 21, 647513) But that is all right.

('80', 414, 6, 25, 647695) She is refusing to have the operation without seeing Kanu.

('80', 415, 2, 3, 648093) WARDHA, August 1, 1941 We want to achieve the welfare of the world by truth and non violence.
('80', 415, 2, 4, 648187) I want you, students of this Vidyalaya, to devote yourselves to a scientific study of the charkha and khadi and make improvements by new inventions and serve the villagers.
('80', 415, 2, 5, 648360) Just as the sun is the centre of the planetary system, so is the charkha of our economic or village structure.
('80', 415, 2, 6, 648471) Without the sun, the world will perish; so without the charkha, which is our saviour and bread giver, we shall lose.
('80', 415, 2, 7, 648588) If khadi comes to stay, everything will be all right; for the progress and improvement of khadi utilize both your intellect and hand power.
('80', 415, 2, 8, 648728) This khadi mantra manifested itself in 1908 when I was in South Africa along with the late Maganlal Gandhi who had made experiments for improving its technique.
('80', 415, 2, 9, 648889) We are not opposed to machinery, but we must meet it by new inventions in our khadi science and by providing work and food for the villagers.
('80', 415, 2, 10, 649031) Make your mind and intellect scientific, so that you students will always search for new things for the betterment of your country.
('80', 415, 2, 11, 649163) Our prayer should be for serving all, Hindus, Muslims and other communities.
('80', 415, 2, 12, 649240) By serving India, we can serve the world, as our object is non exploitation, non suppression and non hatred.
('80', 415, 2, 13, 649349) This requires penance which will add to our knowledge.
('80', 415, 2, 14, 649404) We have to exert ourselves more for passing the test of service to Indians and later to humanity.
('80', 415, 2, 15, 649502) The Charkha Sangh is the central force or the centre of the All India Village Industries’ Association and the Talimi Sangh just as the sun is the guiding force on the solar system (suryamandal).
('80', 415, 2, 16, 649697) Our small beginning with this Vidyalaya may attain or produce better results and our dreams will be realized if you systematically and scientifically study khadishastra (science) for serving the poor villagers, for giving them food and clothing by your sacrifice, suffering, penance and purity of character; by this we shall not only serve India, but also the world.

('80', 416, 3, 4, 650206) MY DEAR IDIOT, Your letter is bad!
('80', 416, 3, 5, 650241) What is the use of your suppressing your illness or weakness?
('80', 416, 3, 6, 650303) It leads to greater anxiety.
('80', 416, 3, 7, 650332) I shall learn to shed anxiety not by companions suppressing truth but by experience which faithful companions should not deny me.
('80', 416, 3, 8, 650462) Do be well and strong.
('80', 416, 3, 9, 650485) I understand your instructions about not writing on other people’s letters.
('80', 416, 3, 10, 650561) In the case referred to, I was careful to write on that part which you would have easily cut out.
('80', 416, 3, 11, 650659) Let Jamnalal have the pleasure of beating you each time.
('80', 416, 3, 12, 650716) Your report about Dehra Dun is exhilarating.
('80', 416, 3, 13, 650761) You will never succeed in telling me when you come what you cannot tell me through letters.
('80', 416, 3, 14, 650853) You know you did not succeed last time.
('80', 416, 3, 15, 650893) I do not mind.
('80', 416, 3, 16, 650908) You will be right in retorting that I never give you time.
('80', 416, 3, 17, 650967) Such is life.
('80', 416, 3, 18, 650981) What is really worth telling I know you will never omit.
('80', 416, 3, 19, 651038) But what is of that nature as a rule admits of writing and cannot await long delay.

('80', 417, 3, 4, 651715) NARANDAS, Kanaiyo is terribly upset.
('80', 417, 3, 5, 651752) Do console him, please.
('80', 417, 3, 6, 651776) I need him badly here but if he wishes to stay on there or if you feel the need to keep him there, you need not worry about me.
('80', 417, 3, 7, 651904) I have always regarded it as my dharma to take whatever work I can from those persons who feel the need to be near me.
('80', 417, 3, 8, 652023) Any other course would not be compatible with scrupulous adherence to truth.
('80', 417, 3, 9, 652100) Realization of God also is impossible in any other way.
('80', 417, 3, 10, 652156) The renunciation of grihasthashrama is inspired by the same ideal.
('80', 417, 3, 11, 652223) It follows, therefore, that it is my duty to think of Kanaiyo’s welfare and take into consideration what will suit you.

('80', 418, 8, 23, 653766) Tari gets fever between 99° 102°.

('80', 419, 3, 5, 654104) I cannot understand this irregular delivery.
('80', 419, 3, 6, 654149) Something wrong at your end.
('80', 419, 3, 7, 654178) What can’t be cured must be endured.
('80', 419, 3, 8, 654215) This public kidnapping of Khurshed 1 is an atrocious thing!
('80', 419, 3, 9, 654275) I do not know that your organization 2 should not take up the case from women’s standpoint.
('80', 419, 3, 10, 654367) You should carefully consider the thing.
('80', 419, 3, 11, 654408) This too under the Defence of India Ordinance.
('80', 419, 3, 12, 654455) What an untruth!
('80', 419, 3, 13, 654472) Your being ill is not a comforting thought.
('80', 419, 3, 14, 654516) You have not fared so badly before in Simla?
('80', 419, 4, 15, 654561) You must bestir yourself and get thoroughly well.
('80', 419, 4, 16, 654611) Or is old age creeping over you?

('80', 420, 6, 23, 656484) Would she not be a burden to you?

('80', 421, 2, 3, 656947) SEVAGRAM, August 4, 1941 1
('80', 421, 3, 4, 656974) Khurshedbehn Naoroji is the youngest grand daughter of the late G.O.M. 2 of India.
('80', 421, 3, 5, 657057) In common with her other sisters, she has dedicated herself to the service of India, in truth, of humanity.
('80', 421, 3, 6, 657165) She felt the call some years ago to go to the Frontier Province.
('80', 421, 3, 7, 657230) and workamong the Pathans there and spread the gospel of non violence.
('80', 421, 3, 8, 657301) She took part also in the last civil disobedience campaign.
('80', 421, 3, 9, 657361) The last time she was in the Frontier was in connection with dacoities and kidnappings.
('80', 421, 3, 10, 657449) She is a brave and fearless woman, and so she had planned to work, if she could, even in the tribal area, and come in contact with the dacoits, and wean them from their error.
('80', 421, 3, 11, 657625) For months she worked within the Province and was trying to cross the border with the permission of the Government.
('80', 421, 3, 12, 657741) But she did not get the permission, though the authorities with whom she came into contact recognized her worth, transparent honesty, and utter absence of secrecy about her movements in the Frontier Province.
('80', 421, 3, 13, 657950) This is clear from the letters she holds from the officials.
('80', 421, 3, 14, 658011) Being tired of waiting she notified the Frontier Government of her intention to cross the border.
('80', 421, 3, 15, 658109) But she was arrested, tried and sentenced to a fine of Rs. 100 or imprisonment for three months in default thereof.
('80', 421, 3, 16, 658225) She preferred the latter and on her finishing the term of imprisonment she was externed from the Frontier Province, and interned in the Island of Bombay.
('80', 421, 3, 17, 658379) She protested against the order and corresponded with the authorities.
('80', 421, 3, 18, 658450) I give below her letters:

('80', 422, 0, 1, 658864) VOL. 80 : 28 DECEMBER, 1940 17 AUGUST, 1941 423
('80', 422, 1, 2, 658912) dated 18th February, 1941, which was served on me just before my release
('80', 422, 2, 3, 658985) from the Peshawar Central Prison on 4th March 1941, I have to state as
('80', 422, 3, 4, 659056) follows:
('80', 422, 4, 5, 659065) I consider the language of the order vague and the restrictions
('80', 422, 5, 6, 659129) unjustifiable, in view of the activities in which I was engaged.
('80', 422, 5, 7, 659194) I place these
('80', 422, 6, 8, 659208) few facts before you.
('80', 422, 7, 9, 659230) For nine months prior to my arrest on 4th December, 1940, I had been
('80', 422, 8, 10, 659299) working in the Bannu District of the North West Frontier Province, trying to
('80', 422, 9, 11, 659376) instil into the minds of the people the ideal of non violence.
('80', 422, 9, 12, 659439) I went about
('80', 422, 10, 13, 659452) from village to village meeting Pirs, Maliks, Khans, as well as dacoits—all
('80', 422, 11, 14, 659528) honour to many of them—who gave a patient hearing to my talks.
('80', 422, 11, 15, 659591) I spoke to
('80', 422, 12, 16, 659602) them on the cowardice and cruelty of carrying away or killing defenceless men,
('80', 422, 13, 17, 659681) women and children.
('80', 422, 13, 18, 659701) I argued with dacoits and tribesmen on the inhumanity of
('80', 422, 14, 19, 659758) killing one’s fellow beings.
('80', 422, 14, 20, 659787) I strove to make villagers responsible for the
('80', 422, 15, 21, 659834) collective security of the villages.
('80', 422, 15, 22, 659871) I asked the Hindus to show more courage,
('80', 422, 16, 23, 659912) and try and create a living bond of sympathy between themselves and their
('80', 422, 17, 24, 659986) Pathan neighbours.
('80', 422, 17, 25, 660005) I begged of the Pathans to live up to their traditions of
('80', 422, 18, 26, 660063) protecting the weak and opposing brute force even from their own kinsmen.
('80', 422, 19, 27, 660137) The above mentioned facts may be verified through Government officials in
('80', 422, 20, 28, 660211) the district concerned, in the North West Frontier Province.
('80', 422, 21, 29, 660272) After due intimation to the authorities, I was proceeding to Walo Tangi in
('80', 422, 22, 30, 660347) Tribal Territory on 4th Dec.
('80', 422, 22, 31, 660376) 1940, to try and obtain the release of some Hindu
('80', 422, 23, 32, 660426) kidnappees, among whom was a woman, when I was arrested.
('80', 422, 23, 33, 660483) I had intended to
('80', 422, 24, 34, 660501) spend some time there, if necessary, until I had accomplished my object.
('80', 422, 25, 35, 660574) During all my talks, private or public, to the Frontier villagers as stated
('80', 422, 26, 36, 660650) above, at least one C.I.D. officer was always present and heard what I said, and
('80', 422, 27, 37, 660731) which in all probability was reported to the Government department
('80', 422, 28, 38, 660798) concerned.
('80', 422, 29, 39, 660809) I, therefore, take the liberty to ask if my conduct or speech in the N.W.F.
('80', 422, 30, 40, 660885) Province, such as I have described, could by any stretch of imagination be
('80', 422, 31, 41, 660960) considered to be prejudicial to the efficient prosecution of the war, to the
('80', 422, 32, 42, 661037) defence of British India, or to the public order.
('80', 422, 33, 43, 661087) I regard my work in the Frontier Province to have been essentially humanitarian.
('80', 422, 33, 44, 661168) I feel sure that I could not have been banished from the N.W.F.P. for the activities described by me.
('80', 422, 33, 45, 661270) If the Government have information to the contrary, they have been entirely misled.
('80', 422, 33, 46, 661354) I should be given
('80', 423, 0, 1, 661372) 424 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 423, 1, 2, 661414) an opportunity of rebutting evidence which has led to the passing of the order against me.
('80', 423, 2, 3, 661505) May I expect an early reply?
('80', 423, 3, 4, 661534) Yours truly, Sd/ K. A. D. NAOROJI The authorities turned a deaf ear to her protest.
('80', 423, 3, 5, 661618) So she decided to break the order of internment if she could not get relief and consequently gave the following notice to the authorities:
('80', 423, 4, 6, 661757) DEAR SIR,
('80', 423, 5, 7, 661767) With reference to your last letter after careful consideration I have
('80', 423, 6, 8, 661837) failed to find the slightest justification for restricting me to the Island of
('80', 423, 7, 9, 661916) Bombay.
('80', 423, 8, 10, 661924) I am prepared to understand in these times of stress for the British Government the prevention of my entry, for the time being, into the Frontier Province.
('80', 423, 8, 11, 662080) But I find it hard to reconcile myself to being cooped up in the Island of Bombay.
('80', 423, 8, 12, 662163) My whole soul rebels against what I hold to bemanifestly unjust and wholly unnecessary.
('80', 423, 8, 13, 662251) It insults my intelligence.
('80', 423, 8, 14, 662279) Unless, therefore, the restriction order is confined only to the Frontier Province and my freedom of movement is left otherwise undisturbed and unless I receive an answer amending the order as requested by June 30, I propose to disobey it.
('80', 423, 9, 15, 662519) Yours truly, Sd/ K. A. D. NAOROJI For very shame, 1 I suppose, and probably also because they felt that they could not justify their high handed action in confining the internment to Bombay they relaxed the order so as to cover the whole of the Bombay Presidency.
('80', 423, 9, 16, 662783) That brought her no relief.
('80', 423, 9, 17, 662811) She resented the underlying distrust.
('80', 423, 9, 18, 662849) As will be seen from the correspondence I have reproduced, she was quite willing to accommodate the authorities by not going to the Frontier Province.
('80', 423, 9, 19, 663000) But she could not possibly tolerate the idea of being confined to the Bombay Presidency.
('80', 423, 9, 20, 663089) There was no reason whatsoever why she should not be allowed to go to Wardha to confer with me, or to go to Allahabad to see the Kamala Nehru Hospital of which she was till the other day one of the active trustees and
('80', 423, 10, 21, 663307) 1 Vide “Letter to Devdas Gandhi”, 13 8 1941.

('80', 424, 1, 2, 663400) secretaries, or to travel to any other part of India, where she has many friends, and where she could be of great service in many of the constructive activities going on in the country.
('80', 424, 1, 3, 663586) At last being utterly dissatisfied with the inexplicable treatment meted out to her she gave notice to the Commissioner of Police, Bombay, on 31st July, 1941, of her intention to proceed to Wardha on the 1st of August if she was left free.
('80', 424, 1, 4, 663826) So on the morning of the 1st she was without trial, shall I say, kidnapped, to the Yeravda Central Jail.
('80', 424, 1, 5, 663931) This action of the Government baffles me, and is a significant and searching commentary on the so called expansion of the Viceregal Council and what not.
('80', 424, 1, 6, 664085) The public should understand that Khurshedbehn’s action is no part of the war resistance.
('80', 424, 1, 7, 664175) But the public is hardly aware of the fact that many persons have been arrested and detained without trial although so far as I am aware there is no charge against them of having offered war resistance either as part of the Congress campaign or outside it.
('80', 424, 1, 8, 664432) They are being detained for reasons of which neither they nor the public have any knowledge.
('80', 424, 1, 9, 664525) Is Khurshedbehn’s case an index of what has been done in these other cases?

('80', 425, 8, 22, 666120) But I understand the delay.
('80', 425, 8, 23, 666148) I see you are having the greatest difficulty in establishing contact with the villagers.
('80', 425, 8, 24, 666237) You are bound to succeed, if you have the right type of workers with the proper spirit of perseverance.
('80', 425, 8, 25, 666341) Do you manufacture your own tools?
('80', 425, 8, 26, 666376) You ought not to depend upon Sabarmati or Nalwadi.
('80', 425, 8, 27, 666427) We must fail, if we depend on distant depots.
('80', 425, 8, 28, 666473) Decentralization to the nth degree is necessary for success.

('80', 426, 1, 3, 666786) Did I ever ask you to go to Quetta and advise the Baluchistan Congress about constructive work?
('80', 426, 1, 4, 666882) Maulvi Abdus Samad is the President or Secretary.
('80', 426, 1, 5, 666932) I promised that I would ask you to proceed there and give a few days.
('80', 426, 1, 6, 667002) I have the notion that I sent you a hurried line about this.
('80', 426, 1, 7, 667063) But as you make no reference to the matter, I wonder what happened.

('80', 427, 7, 25, 668797) I am not able to decide.
('80', 427, 7, 26, 668822) Its odour is offensive.
('80', 427, 7, 27, 668846) I dare not increase the quantity of food.
('80', 427, 7, 28, 668888) The blood pressure is well under control.

('80', 428, 1, 2, 669294) 739. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
('80', 428, 2, 3, 669322) WARDHAGANJ, August 5, 1941 I have read a Press summary of a letter said to have been written to me by 48 persons from the Gujrat Jail (Punjab).
('80', 428, 2, 4, 669466) The question asked in the message is: “Would it be possible for any member of the Congress to use violent means against a violent dacoit under grave and provocative conditions, and yet remain in the Congress fold?” Of course it is possible, it is even possible for people to remain in the Congress although they deliberately break every Congress rule.
('80', 428, 2, 5, 669818) But if I am asked whether such persons should remain in the Congress, my answer would be an emphatic ‘No’.
('80', 428, 2, 6, 669925) That is for public conduct.
('80', 428, 2, 7, 669953) No law has been laid down by the Congress as to private conduct.
('80', 428, 2, 8, 670018) The Congress will refuse, as it should, to judge the conduct of a person who resists by force a robber robbing his property, or an assailant molesting his daughter.
('80', 428, 2, 9, 670183) However, the Congress Resolution passed at Poona clearly lays down that volunteer organizations for the purpose of self defence organized by the Congress or with which Congressmen are associated, must adhere to non violence.
('80', 428, 2, 10, 670408) Whether persons who break the rule or even preach the use of violence by Congressmen in such cases should be turned out of the Congress is a different question.
('80', 428, 2, 11, 670569) My personal attitude is clear.
('80', 428, 2, 12, 670600) I would not necessarily turn out such persons from the Congress.
('80', 428, 2, 13, 670665) My letter to the Delhi President of the Congress Committee has been misquoted or misunderstood.
('80', 428, 2, 14, 670761) 1 I deliberately advised against expulsion from the Congress.
('80', 428, 2, 15, 670823) I have always held that it is an action to be adopted in rare case.
('80', 428, 2, 16, 670891) I know some persons have interpreted my advice 2 to Shri Munshi as expulsion.
('80', 428, 2, 17, 670969) I regard the step taken by him as that of a high souled man.
('80', 428, 2, 18, 671030) He had taken no overt action.
('80', 428, 2, 19, 671060) He had conscientious scruples.
('80', 428, 2, 20, 671091) He referred to me for advice and, in his own interest and that of the Congress, I advised him to go out of the Congress.
('80', 428, 2, 21, 671212) There was no coercion, even remote or indirect.
('80', 428, 2, 22, 671260) His retirement was wholly
('80', 428, 3, 23, 671286) 1 The Hindu, 4 7 1941, had quoted the letter as follows: “If any four anna Congress member, directly or indirectly, participates in the war effort, he should be expelled from the Congress membership.” Vide also “Letter to Raghunandan Saran”, Before 16 7 1941. 2 Vide “Statement to the Press”, 15 6 1941

('80', 429, 1, 3, 671680) I have no reason whatsoever for repenting of my advice, which I should unhesitatingly repeat in every such case.

('80', 429, 5, 14, 672211) You were right also in vetoing his going to Hardwar.

('80', 432, 12, 31, 676550) BHAI VITHTHALDAS, Bhai Jajuji 2 had sent me your budget for my information.
('80', 432, 12, 32, 676626) I made the suggestions without much thinking.
('80', 432, 12, 33, 676672) You have identified yourself with the work of the Spinners’ Association as much as Jajuji and I. We may, therefore, put our points of view before you and then agree with what you say.
('80', 432, 12, 34, 676856) Is it not true, as a rule, that as sales increase the cost diminishes?
('80', 432, 12, 35, 676927) That is, either the cost price decreases or profits

('80', 433, 1, 2, 677088) increase.
('80', 433, 1, 3, 677098) Since we do not want to make profit we should reduce the prices.
('80', 433, 1, 4, 677163) But I thought that, since you are increasing the number of shops, in the beginning the expenses might go up, but in the end they are bound to come down.
('80', 433, 1, 5, 677316) If this reasoning is correct, you should tell me when the cost is likely to begin decreasing.

('80', 433, 11, 17, 677820) What you say is not correct.
('80', 433, 11, 18, 677849) It seems you have not understood at all the nature of the struggle this time.
('80', 433, 11, 19, 677927) It is no good people going to jail simply because others have done so.
('80', 433, 11, 20, 677998) If there are poor people who want to do constructive work but cannot you will be needed to organize them.
('80', 433, 11, 21, 678104) You will be needed even if there is a riot again.
('80', 433, 11, 22, 678154) It will do even if no one from Gujarat goes to jail for the present.

('80', 433, 11, 25, 678316) Your letter bespeaks cowardice and impatience.
('80', 433, 11, 26, 678363) It does not behove you.

('80', 434, 4, 5, 678674) August 6, 1941
('80', 434, 5, 6, 678689) SUSHILA, I have received your two letters together today.
('80', 434, 5, 7, 678747) You are unnecessarily worrying about me.
('80', 434, 5, 8, 678788) I am well enough to be able to say that God will look after me.
('80', 434, 5, 9, 678852) I have no fear.
('80', 434, 5, 10, 678868) I have already written that I have increased the milk quota and started taking onions and garlic.
('80', 434, 5, 11, 678966) Do not worry.
('80', 434, 5, 12, 678980) Concentrate on your studies and see that you not only pass but there is nothing in the field worth knowing that you do not know.
('80', 434, 5, 13, 679109) I want you to have the ability to formulate a plan for a small or big hospital and to say what it should be like, and to map out a plan for rural health.
('80', 434, 5, 14, 679263) All this is possible only if you become a sanyasini for one year.
('80', 434, 5, 15, 679329) Sharma’s case is as you describe.
('80', 434, 5, 16, 679363) But I have the impression that he is honest.
('80', 434, 5, 17, 679408) There is no need to ask Mahadev because I know his opinion.
('80', 434, 5, 18, 679468) You can be of great use if you can control yourself.
('80', 434, 5, 19, 679521) But if your joining this interferes with your studies, I do not wish to involve you.
('80', 434, 5, 20, 679606) Hence, instead of leaving it to me, give your independent view.
('80', 434, 5, 21, 679670) Let Tari be here for the present.
('80', 434, 5, 22, 679704) If her health deteriorates I shall send her there.
('80', 434, 5, 23, 679755) She seems to be happy that she is able to live independently.
('80', 434, 5, 24, 679817) I meet her every morning.
('80', 434, 5, 25, 679843) On second thoughts, I feel that I should not involve you in the Sharma affair.
('80', 434, 5, 26, 679922) Forget it.
('80', 434, 5, 27, 679933) You should not be saddled with that responsibility.

('80', 435, 7, 10, 680475) In the death of Rabindranath Tagore, we have not only lost the greatest poet of the age, but an ardent nationalist who was also a humanitarian.
('80', 435, 7, 11, 680619) There was hardly any public activity on which he has not left the impress of his powerful personality.
('80', 435, 7, 12, 680722) In Santiniketan and Sriniketan, he has left a legacy to the whole nation, indeed, to the world.

('80', 436, 6, 9, 682127) Sailen’s you need not correct if you have not done already.
('80', 436, 6, 10, 682187) I wrote 2 to him strongly about his great carelessness.

('80', 436, 6, 12, 682296) But I have read the two articles in Indian Social Reformer on it and some other reviews.
('80', 436, 6, 13, 682385) It appeared to me to be a good report.
('80', 436, 6, 14, 682424) I do not know that anything is coming out of all this effort.
('80', 436, 6, 15, 682486) (I am writing this in the midst of interruptions.) Your letter is disquieting.
('80', 436, 6, 16, 682565) You don’t seem to have profited by the change as much as I had expected.
('80', 436, 6, 17, 682638) So you are obliged to doubt your ability to return even at the end of the month.

('80', 436, 7, 21, 683162) Of course, before those few days could elapse, my Liberal, Conservative and Labour colleagues in London would send for me to come home and would have a padded cell waiting for me on my arrival.’ ” 2 Vide “Letter to Amrit Kaur”, 5 8 1941 3 This was appointed under the Chairmanship of B. N. Rau in January 1941, “to examine the Hindu Women’s Rights to Property Act of 1937 (as amended by Act XI of 1938) with particular reference to five private Bills.” The report, which was published from New Delhi on July 26, advocated “immediate admission of the daughter to an equal share with the daughter in law”.
('80', 436, 7, 22, 683766) It suggested “legislation for agricultural land, with retrospective effect, in order to give widows the full measure of multiplicity of rules of succession”.
('80', 436, 7, 23, 683924) The Committee had recommended “preparation” in gradual stages, of a complete code of Hindu Law” beginning with the law of succession, instead of piecemeal legislation.

('80', 438, 6, 15, 685754) Why this despondency?
('80', 438, 6, 16, 685776) You have not failed and left me.
('80', 438, 6, 17, 685809) Why do you allow yourself to be affected by what other people may say?
('80', 438, 6, 18, 685880) That is not scientific thinking.
('80', 438, 6, 19, 685913) A good doctor should be of steadfast intellect.
('80', 438, 6, 20, 685961) Hence, you will truly be an M.D. when you develop a sense of detachment and do not let yourself be affected by anything whatever.

('80', 443, 8, 12, 692139) MY DEAR ANNADA, Your letter.
('80', 443, 8, 13, 692168) The reason why the alteration was made is that there were charges against the Bengal Branch which need elucidation.
('80', 443, 8, 14, 692284) The Khadi Pratishthan case is wholly of a different type.
('80', 443, 8, 15, 692342) The question then was whether they sold cheaper.
('80', 443, 8, 16, 692391) If they have, it does not much matter.
('80', 443, 8, 17, 692430) The charge against the Bengal Branch is that it sold khadi dearer, unduly loaded the khadi prices.
('80', 443, 8, 18, 692529) It is [a] matter of much moment.
('80', 443, 8, 19, 692562) I would myself like to be satisfied as to what has happened.
('80', 443, 8, 20, 692623) Do you see the distinction?
('80', 443, 8, 21, 692651) The reference should therefore be as follows: ‘Whether during the years 1937 to 1939 the Bengal Branch unduly loaded the khadi prices and sold khadi much dearer than what they should have.
('80', 443, 8, 22, 692840) What should have been and what has been the gross margin during the said years and to report on the reasons for the high prices, if any, and on the use made of the margin, if any.’

('80', 444, 3, 4, 693318) SUSHILA, Because you do not mark your letter ‘Personal’, they are opened, but nobody reads them.
('80', 444, 3, 5, 693415) You worry unnecessarily.
('80', 444, 3, 6, 693440) What makes you think that I shall not do as you say?
('80', 444, 3, 7, 693493) I have already written to you that I have increased my milk quota by 50 per cent.
('80', 444, 3, 8, 693575) I am also trying to take more rotis.
('80', 444, 3, 9, 693612) I have of course started taking garlic and onions.
('80', 444, 3, 10, 693663) Now let me see what happens.
('80', 444, 3, 11, 693692) Since I take a shorter route, there is no appreciable increase in walking.
('80', 444, 3, 12, 693767) I am taking great care.
('80', 444, 3, 13, 693791) Do not worry.

('80', 444, 8, 23, 694166) I have not received any communication either from the Maulana Sahib or any other prisoner; nor has any messenger come to me with such representations.
('80', 444, 9, 24, 694317) Asked what the position was of Congressmen in jail, who felt that the policy of the Congress should be revised in view of the altered situation at home and abroad, Gandhiji said: If they have changed their views and want a change of colour, of course, they can do so at any time.
('80', 444, 9, 25, 694597) They have only to declare this and the Government will be glad to oblige them.
('80', 444, 10, 26, 694676) 1 Reported under the date line “Nagpur, August 10” 2 The correspondent had drawn Gandhiji’s attention to the report that “forty prisoners in the Naini Jail, including the Congress President, made representations to him urging a change in Congress policy in view of the changed international situation”.

('80', 447, 5, 16, 698047) August 10, 1941
('80', 447, 6, 17, 698063) BABUDI, Tell Chokhawala that he has expressed his opinion without careful thinking.
('80', 447, 6, 18, 698147) You have been weak in body from your very birth.
('80', 447, 6, 19, 698196) If you had been eating everything, you would not have lived long enough to marry Chokhawala.
('80', 447, 6, 20, 698289) Anybody who can have milk, ghee and greens will never be delicate in health.
('80', 447, 6, 21, 698366) If he but looks around, he will see that the innumerable people who fall ill eat chillies and fried stuff.
('80', 447, 6, 22, 698473) If he visits a hospital, he will find it full of such people.
('80', 447, 6, 23, 698535) Let Anand, therefore, grow up, while he is a child, on milk, curds, fruits, greens and bread.
('80', 447, 6, 24, 698629) When he grows up he will choose for himself.
('80', 447, 6, 25, 698674) I am trying to buy a copy of Kuhne’s book.
('80', 447, 6, 26, 698717) If that friend does not arrive you need do nothing.

('80', 448, 2, 3, 698997) August 10, 1941
('80', 448, 3, 4, 699013) MATHURADAS, Your letter has just arrived.
('80', 448, 3, 5, 699055) Radha’s letter too arrived at the same time.
('80', 448, 3, 6, 699100) I am sending it to you.
('80', 448, 3, 7, 699124) I think it would not be good to make her give up the job she has got.
('80', 448, 3, 8, 699194) You may disregard the money.
('80', 448, 3, 9, 699223) You may disregard experience.
('80', 448, 3, 10, 699253) But you may not disregard the loss of reputation.
('80', 448, 3, 11, 699303) Is it Radha’s medical knowledge you need or just her company?
('80', 448, 3, 12, 699365) If you want only the company, why not have Bindu?
('80', 448, 3, 13, 699415) Or should I find somebody else?
('80', 448, 3, 14, 699447) It is embarrassing that just when you expressed a desire to call her, Radha finds herself in an awkward situation.

('80', 448, 8, 21, 699748) SUSHILA, There is no letter from you today.
('80', 448, 8, 22, 699792) Sankaran’s letter is enclosed.
('80', 448, 8, 23, 699823) My weight has increased by 1 1b.
('80', 448, 8, 24, 699856) Do not worry about me and concentrate on your work.
('80', 448, 8, 25, 699908) I do not at all like that you should remain unhappy.
('80', 448, 8, 26, 699961) There is absolutely no reason for it.
('80', 448, 8, 27, 699999) You must understand that if you become dispirited and disheartened or if you fail, I will be held responsible for it, and justifiably, because when you were not in very close touch with me, you succeeded in everything you did.
('80', 448, 8, 28, 700226) There was nothing like disappointment.
('80', 448, 8, 29, 700265) From your association with me would your qualities be further enriched or would they be diminished?
('80', 448, 8, 30, 700365) I know that nothing is going to be achieved by argument.
('80', 448, 8, 31, 700422) Association with people has a subtle influence.
('80', 448, 8, 32, 700470) We cannot free ourselves from it.

('80', 449, 5, 10, 700890) DEAR IDIOT, Your note.
('80', 449, 5, 11, 700913) You do not say whether you lost your headache and why you had it.
('80', 449, 5, 12, 700979) I do not mind your imprisoning Jamnalal for a year, so long as you do not have to be with him all that time.
('80', 449, 5, 13, 701088) I have heard that Simla is at its very best in winter and it is the cheapest—rent is nothing and vegetables and fruit you get for a song.
('80', 449, 5, 14, 701226) Valji was there during a winter and profited by his stay.

('80', 449, 5, 17, 701381) We have a positive infliction.
('80', 449, 5, 18, 701412) They have now attacked my bathroom and may spread throughout the place if their mischief is not stopped in [time].
('80', 449, 5, 19, 701527) The agricultural department must know the remedy.
('80', 449, 5, 20, 701577) Have I not told you that malish is done by Dhiren and office work by Lakshmidas?
('80', 449, 5, 21, 701658) Amtul Salaam is quite well.
('80', 449, 5, 22, 701686) She has added seven pounds to her weight and is active the whole day long.

('80', 450, 6, 21, 702806) By going to jail just now you would only feel self satisfied.

('80', 451, 6, 7, 703698) SUSHILA, Your letter has arrived only today.
('80', 451, 6, 8, 703743) You will have fully recovered by now.
('80', 451, 6, 9, 703781) I did not have any particular hospital in mind.
('80', 451, 6, 10, 703829) Let us first see someone making a donation of Rs. 30 lakhs.
('80', 451, 6, 11, 703889) Only then will you be in a position to say what kind of a hospital could be run with that amount, and what kind with a hundred rupees.
('80', 451, 6, 12, 704024) I know this is very difficult.
('80', 451, 6, 13, 704055) But does not the M.D. degree mean the capacity to know the most difficult things?
('80', 451, 6, 14, 704137) Only you can say whether all this is possible through a study course of one year.
('80', 451, 6, 15, 704219) Perhaps an M.D. is not required to have knowledge of this kind.
('80', 451, 6, 16, 704283) But even if that be so, I would expect you to have that knowledge, because I have observed that medical skill is a god given gift to you, so that you are able to turn your reading and observation into something good.
('80', 451, 6, 17, 704500) Had I known that you would be so upset by your failure I would not have allowed you to appear for the examination at all.
('80', 451, 6, 18, 704622) I should have respected Pyarelal’s knowledge of you and gone with his advice.
('80', 451, 6, 19, 704700) But I thought in my pride that I too knew you well.
('80', 451, 6, 20, 704752) I also assumed in my pride that you had developed detachment to a certain extent after being in contact with me.
('80', 451, 6, 21, 704865) But it is no use crying over spilt milk.
('80', 451, 6, 22, 704906) Now as far as possible try to forget your failure at the last examination and work hard to pass the next examination.
('80', 451, 6, 23, 705024) There should be no obstacle to it.
('80', 451, 6, 24, 705059) I commend your resolve not to seek any financial help.
('80', 451, 6, 25, 705114) But even there, stubbornness would not be proper.
('80', 451, 6, 26, 705164) If you need to have more free time for the sake of your examination, then you must accept such help.

('80', 453, 6, 19, 707286) WARDHA, August 12, 1941 The seventeenth instant is the shraddha day of Gurudev.
('80', 453, 6, 20, 707366) Those who attach religious significance to the shraddha ceremony will no doubt fast for the day by abstaining from food altogether or confining themselves only to fruits, and devote themselves to prayer.
('80', 453, 6, 21, 707570) The prayer may be individual or congregational.
('80', 453, 6, 22, 707618) Every city and every village which has partaken of Gurudev’s uplifting message delivered through his writings and lived in his life will meet at an hour best suited to them and contemplate the noble life and dedicate themselves for the country’s service.
('80', 453, 6, 23, 707873) Gurudev stood for peace and goodwill.
('80', 453, 6, 24, 707911) He knew no communal barriers.
('80', 453, 6, 25, 707941) I, therefore, hope that all sections will join together in observing the solemn day and promote communal harmony.
('80', 453, 6, 26, 708055) I would like all further to remember that the bulk of the Deenabandhu Memorial still remains to be collected.
('80', 453, 6, 27, 708165) Sad to say, it has also become Gurudev’s Memorial, for the simple reason that collections of the Memorial are to be solely devoted to the upkeep and expansion of Santiniketan, which includes the Visvabharati and
('80', 454, 0, 1, 708377) VOL. 80 : 28 DECEMBER, 1940 17 AUGUST, 1941 455
('80', 454, 1, 2, 708425) Sriniketan.
('80', 454, 1, 3, 708437) This does not exclude a separate and special memorial for Gurudev, but it would be a mockery even to think of one before the memorial conceived by Gurudev himself has been fulfilled.
('80', 454, 1, 4, 708620) It would be a fitting finish to the solemn day if the workers and organizers make it a point to collect for the memorial and send them to Messrs Bachraj and Company, 51 Mahatma Gandhi Road, Bombay.

('80', 462, 5, 7, 718851) August 14, 1941
('80', 462, 6, 8, 718867) JAMNALAL, Your health seems to be improving there.
('80', 462, 6, 9, 718918) It seems from Dr. Menkel’s report that the knee trouble will remain for ever.
('80', 462, 6, 10, 718996) If there is no other complication, I see no harm.
('80', 462, 6, 11, 719046) Do not leave that place, as long as you get peace of mind there.
('80', 462, 6, 12, 719111) Do not be very keen on seeing [Sir Francis] Wylie.
('80', 462, 6, 13, 719162) There will be no harm if you can see him without any effort.
('80', 462, 6, 14, 719223) It would not be good if you have to make an effort to see him.
('80', 462, 6, 15, 719286) I was very pleased to see Ramakrishna.
('80', 462, 6, 16, 719325) He is taking full advantage of his stay in prison.

('80', 462, 10, 20, 719473) August 14, 1941
('80', 462, 11, 21, 719489) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, I got your letter yesterday.
('80', 462, 11, 22, 719536) I was glad to receive it, but was pained on reading it.
('80', 462, 11, 23, 719592) Mahadev did write to me about your health having suffered.
('80', 462, 11, 24, 719651) But your letter suggests that it has got much worse.
('80', 462, 11, 25, 719704) If that is so, what is the use of having Dr. Gilder there?
('80', 462, 11, 26, 719763) If he cannot improve your health, you will be dismissed.
('80', 462, 11, 27, 719820) Personally I would prefer your living for some time on fruit juices.
('80', 462, 11, 28, 719889) It would clear the obstruction, if any, in the bowels.
('80', 462, 11, 29, 719944) If you take

('80', 463, 1, 3, 720168) If you can take the juice in sufficient quantity—say, 60 ounces—there is no reason why you should grow weak.
('80', 463, 1, 4, 720277) And along with it if you apply mud packs on the abdomen at night, I am sure it will do you good.
('80', 463, 1, 5, 720374) It must not become necessary to release you because of illness.
('80', 463, 1, 6, 720438) Keep me regularly informed.
('80', 463, 1, 7, 720466) Drop a postcard if nothing more.
('80', 463, 1, 8, 720499) The workers in Gujarat are being tested well.
('80', 463, 1, 9, 720545) They seem to be working all right.
('80', 463, 1, 10, 720580) Mahadev also is gaining fairly good experience.
('80', 463, 1, 11, 720628) I don’t experience any difficulty, since Kishorelal is staying here.
('80', 463, 1, 12, 720697) He is indeed a great help to me.
('80', 463, 1, 13, 720730) My health may be said to be generally good.
('80', 463, 1, 14, 720774) Ba has regained good strength.
('80', 463, 1, 15, 720805) She walks about three quarters of a mile every evening, besides working the whole day.
('80', 463, 1, 16, 720892) She is able to eat well.
('80', 463, 1, 17, 720917) There is no cause at all for worry.
('80', 463, 1, 18, 720953) Jamnalal also is better.
('80', 463, 1, 19, 720978) He is having change of air in Simla.
('80', 463, 1, 20, 721015) He is regaining strength.
('80', 463, 1, 21, 721041) He is Rajkumari’s prisoner there, eating the food she permits, walking eight miles a day, playing chess and enjoying himself.
('80', 463, 1, 22, 721167) He has the atmosphere he wanted.
('80', 463, 1, 23, 721200) Janakibehn and Madalasa are with me and they have their meals with me.
('80', 463, 1, 24, 721271) Both are well.
('80', 463, 1, 25, 721286) Janakibehn can run fast for four or five miles.
('80', 463, 1, 26, 721334) Madalasa is in the family way.
('80', 463, 1, 27, 721365) It is the seventh month.
('80', 463, 1, 28, 721390) She had ulcers in the mouth, but they have disappeared now.
('80', 463, 1, 29, 721450) This time the delivery is likely to be normal.
('80', 463, 1, 30, 721497) Gurudev having passed away, I have had to take up the responsibility of collecting the Deenabandhu Fund as quickly as possible.
('80', 463, 1, 31, 721625) God’s will be done.
('80', 463, 1, 32, 721645) Kusum [Desai] is here at present.
('80', 463, 1, 33, 721679) She helps me a little.
('80', 463, 1, 34, 721702) She will stay for about a month or may be more.
('80', 463, 1, 35, 721750) I have left it to her.

('80', 464, 3, 10, 722222) He is not here at present.
('80', 464, 3, 11, 722249) I have almost given up going to Tari.
('80', 464, 3, 12, 722287) Be firm and complete your programme.
('80', 464, 3, 13, 722324) It seems best to take leave without pay.
('80', 464, 3, 14, 722365) It is due to obstinacy that you are refusing to take money.
('80', 464, 3, 15, 722425) Give up all worry and complete your study and gain full experience.

('80', 464, 8, 24, 722738) I ought to have sent you a copy of my letter to Sarangadhar Das.
('80', 464, 8, 25, 722803) But there it is.
('80', 464, 8, 26, 722820) I never succeed in doing such things as they should be done.
('80', 464, 8, 27, 722881) Your apples are extra fine.

('80', 464, 8, 29, 722934) That I do likewise goes without saying.
('80', 464, 8, 30, 722974) This is not to be taken as an invitation to send more.
('80', 464, 8, 31, 723029) What about the price of fruit in winter in Simla?
('80', 464, 8, 32, 723079) A crowd is coming in.
('80', 464, 8, 33, 723101) Do make small collections in Simla.
('80', 464, 8, 34, 723137) I see this will be in your hands after the event.

('80', 465, 3, 5, 723532) Your being with Kakasaheb is by itself half the medicine.

('80', 465, 3, 7, 723674) You two sisters should now leave only after fully restoring Kakasaheb to health.

('80', 468, 3, 4, 726303) LETTER FROM SUBHAS CHANDRA BOSE1
('80', 468, 4, 5, 726336) CALCUTTA, December 23, 1940
('80', 468, 5, 6, 726364) When Mahadevbhai saw me in the Presidency Jail, I took the opportunity of conveying a message to you.
('80', 468, 5, 7, 726466) I requested him to tell you that, if you launched a movement, then our services would be entirely at your disposal, for what they were worth.
('80', 468, 5, 8, 726608) I also waned him to request you to take the initiative in settling the dispute in Bengal, so that the Province could throw its whole weight into the movement.
('80', 468, 5, 9, 726767) Since you have been appointed Dictator, you could easily take up this matter on behalf of the Congress.
('80', 468, 5, 10, 726871) So, I thought.
('80', 468, 6, 11, 726886) At the time, my fond expectation was that you would launch a mass movement, as you had done in 1921, 1930 and 1932, though Mahadevbhai told me that you had been thinking of individual civil disobedience.
('80', 468, 6, 12, 727090) Today it is clear that the movement launched by you is not on the issue of our national demand for independence.
('80', 468, 6, 13, 727203) Nor is this movement a mass struggle.
('80', 468, 6, 14, 727241) If the Government were to permit anti war speeches, it appears to me, the movement would come to an end.
('80', 468, 6, 15, 727346) Nevertheless we would like to co operate with such a movement, despite its restricted scope and form, so far as it lies in our power consistently with our political stand.
('80', 468, 6, 16, 727518) We would like to know if you would accept our co operation for what it is worth—and if so, what you would like us to do in pursuance of this offer of co operation.
('80', 468, 6, 17, 727682) This proffered co operation is unconditional in the sense that whatever grievances we may have against the Congress High Command will not stand in our way.
('80', 468, 6, 18, 727838) If and when the High Command deal with us unfairly and unjustly, we shall have to react accordingly.
('80', 468, 6, 19, 727939) We may have to fight the arbitrary and high handed action of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad at the present time.
('80', 468, 6, 20, 728045) But this can never blind us to the larger issues before the country, and there you can have our fullest co operation, consistently with our political stand.
('80', 468, 6, 21, 728202) I beg you to accept our offer of co operation.
('80', 468, 7, 22, 728249) Regarding the Bengal situation, I had told Mahadevbhai that if you desired unity, you could have it for the mere asking, and all that was necessary was a talk between you and my brother, Sarat Babu.
('80', 468, 7, 23, 728448) Since then the situation has deteriorated.
('80', 468, 7, 24, 728491) You have chosen to remain silent and indifferent.
('80', 468, 7, 25, 728541) The Maulana has been rushing

('80', 469, 1, 2, 728663) headlong along the mad path of what he calls disciplinary action.
('80', 469, 1, 3, 728729) I am not bothered about it, because if he wills it and seeks it, we are ready to meet him on his own ground.
('80', 469, 1, 4, 728838) He cannot affect our public position in the least, and he has only been making himself ridiculous before the public of this province and thereby dragging the name of the Congress to the dust.
('80', 469, 1, 5, 729030) Since the Maulana’s action seems to have your tacit approval, I am not seeking your intervention in this matter.
('80', 469, 1, 6, 729143) All that I desire is that, despite this unfortunate side show which has been forced on us, we should co operate where larger issues are concerned.
('80', 469, 1, 7, 729290) and so far as we are concerned, we are anxious to co operate.
('80', 469, 1, 8, 729352) In all sincerity, I am offering you our co operation.
('80', 469, 2, 9, 729406) I am sending this letter through a relative who is going to Nagpur.
('80', 469, 2, 10, 729474) I am asking him to wait for a reply.
('80', 469, 3, 11, 729511) How is your health?
('80', 469, 3, 12, 729531) The papers again give disquieting news.

('80', 469, 6, 16, 729634) LETTER FROM SIR J. G. LAITHWAITE 1
('80', 469, 7, 17, 729669) VICEROY’S CAMP, SUNDERBANS, January 4, 1941
('80', 469, 8, 18, 729713) DEAR MR. GANDHI,
('80', 469, 9, 19, 729730) Thank you for your letter of the 30th December, which I have laid before His Excellency.
('80', 469, 9, 20, 729819) You must not regard my letter of the 27th December, which dealt solely with your request for the Viceroy’s personal assistance for intervention and action in the transmission of your message, as in any way an exhaustive exposition of the reasons which have necessitated the decision of which you complain, and the observations contained in it as to His Excellency’s personal feelings could quite clearly have no relations whatever to the matter of publicity in India.
('80', 469, 9, 21, 730287) It will, however, be obvious to you that so far as a personal request such as you made is concerned, it would be out of the question for the head of the Executive Government, merely on personal grounds, to take special steps to facilitate the transmission of a document which, in the respects alluded to in my letter, any other relevant considerations apart, he cannot but regard as containing an unfair presentation of very important facts to its addressee.
('80', 469, 10, 22, 730746) His Excellency asks me to add that as this correspondence which started on an

('80', 470, 1, 2, 730963) entirely personal basis is clearly taken by your letter of the 30th December into the official field, and as he thinks it important that the official and personal fields should not overlap, he feels that he has no option, in the interests of avoiding misunderst anding, but with great reluctance, to conclude that the present channel of communi cation had better not be further pursued in regard to the present matter.
('80', 470, 2, 3, 731382) But he asks me to take the opportunity to add an expression of his apprecia tion of the attitude displayed in the concluding paragraph of your letter under reply.
('80', 470, 3, 4, 731545) Yours sincerely,

('80', 470, 7, 9, 731671) LETTER FROM SIR J. C. LAITHWAITE1
('80', 470, 8, 10, 731705) THE VICEROY’S HOUSE, NEW DELHI, January 28, 1941
('80', 470, 9, 11, 731754) DEAR MR. GANDHI,
('80', 470, 10, 12, 731771) Thank you very much for your letter of the 16th January which I have laid before His Excellency.
('80', 470, 10, 13, 731868) He is very glad to note your decision, and he asks me to say that he much appreciates the emphasis you have laid in your letter on your attitude towards the embarrassing of authority.
('80', 470, 11, 14, 732052) I see that you are under some misapprehension as to the manner in which the statements enclosed with your letter failed to appear in the Press.
('80', 470, 11, 15, 732196) There is no such thing as the censorship of matter intended for publication in the Indian Press nor has any prohibition been issued in respect of your two statements.
('80', 470, 11, 16, 732363) In view, however, of the provisions of the Defence of India Rules regarding the publication of prejudicial reports, Press agencies and editors have the option of voluntarily submitting for advice messages in regard to which they feel any doubt.
('80', 470, 11, 17, 732608) In giving advice on such references the Press Advisers have regard only to the question whether the matter submitted contains any prejudicial report, the publication of which would render the person concerned liable to prosecution under the Defence of India Rules.
('80', 470, 11, 18, 732873) You will see, for instance, that both the Congress Pledge and your own statement 2 about Independence Day, although similarly referred for Press advice, were passed for publication, because they had no direct connection with movement intended to

('80', 471, 0, 1, 733219) 472 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 471, 1, 2, 733261) interfere with the prosecution of the war.
('80', 471, 1, 3, 733304) On the other hand, both the statements 1
('80', 471, 2, 4, 733345) enclosed with your letter were, I regret to say, of this nature.
('80', 471, 2, 5, 733410) Although considerable portions of them could have been published without objection, at least from the point of view of the war, each of them contained numerous passages which were clearly intended or likely to encourage and instruct persons engaged in your civil disobedience movement.
('80', 471, 2, 6, 733696) This movement in its present form consists of the uttering in public of slogans purporting to dissuade the public from participation in the war effort and thus in the words of the Defence of India Rules “to influence the conduct or attitude of the public or any section of the public in a manner likely to be prejudicial to the defence of British India or to the efficient prosecution of the war”.
('80', 471, 2, 7, 734094) In so far as they contained such passages, the statements in question could not have been published without exposing the editor or Press agency concerned to the risk of prosecution and the Press Advisers were only performing their clear duty in advising the Press against their publication.
('80', 471, 2, 8, 734385) The Press were of course not obliged to take this advice, but you would not expect them, I think, to take a risk of which they were warned and you will see the dilemma in which they are placed when they receive such statements from you for publication.
('80', 471, 2, 9, 734638) His Excellency feels sure that you will appreciate that the liberty of the Press does not and cannot in any country mean the right to publish anything without prosecution, more especially at a time of grave emergency such as this, and that without any interference with such liberty the Press Advisers were fully justified in giving the advice they did and the Press in accepting it.

('80', 471, 7, 15, 735152) LETTER FROM T. B. SAPRU2
('80', 471, 8, 16, 735177) January 28, 1941
('80', 471, 9, 17, 735194) DEAR MAHATMAJI,
('80', 471, 10, 18, 735210) I thank you for your letter of the 25th of January, which I received yesterday.
('80', 471, 10, 19, 735290) I am glad to know that my article in the Twentieth Century had attracted your notice.
('80', 471, 11, 20, 735376) 1 Vide “Instructions to Satyagrahis”, 10 1 1941 and “Instruction to Satyag rahis”, 12 1 1941 2 Vide “Letter to T. B. Sapru”, 25 1 1941 and “Letter to T. B. Sapru”, 1 2 1941
('80', 472, 0, 1, 735549) VOL. 80 : 28 DECEMBER, 1940 17 AUGUST, 1941 473
('80', 472, 1, 2, 735597) I read in the papers that you had gone to Bombay to see Mr. Jinnah but I do not know what exactly passed between you and him there.
('80', 472, 1, 3, 735729) I met Mr. Jinnah by the merest accident at Dr. Berger’s Clinic in Bombay on the 6th or the 7th of August last.
('80', 472, 1, 4, 735840) He came up to me and asked me to have tea with him.
('80', 472, 1, 5, 735892) Accordingly I went to him the next day and I had a conversation with him lasting for about one hour and a half.
('80', 472, 1, 6, 736004) He told me what had transpired between you and him at Delhi and of the differences which arose between you and him in the presence of the Viceroy.
('80', 472, 1, 7, 736151) My impression was that though there was a general conversation between you and him on some of the political demands of the Congress, the communal question did not specifically form the subject of discussion.
('80', 472, 2, 8, 736359) You are, if I may say so, quite right in saying that we have to settle our domestic troubles ourselves and that without thinking whether the British will accept our joint demands or not.
('80', 472, 2, 9, 736546) That has always been my view.
('80', 472, 2, 10, 736576) I am afraid, the communal situation has been allowed too long to deteriorate from bad to worse and I very strongly feel that that is the one question to which every one of us (and particularly you with your influence) have to address ourselves.
('80', 472, 2, 11, 736821) For so long as these differences last among ourselves, I am afraid, real self government is difficult to achieve and still more difficult to maintain.
('80', 472, 3, 12, 736972) During the Christmas Week Nawab Mohammad Ismail and Nawab Liaquat Ali Khan were here in connection with the session of the Provincial Muslim league.
('80', 472, 3, 13, 737121) The former, who is an old friend of mine, came to see me and I met the latter at the house of a common friend.
('80', 472, 3, 14, 737232) We talked freely and pleasantly and the impression left on my mind was that though the task of settlement would present great difficulties, it was by no means hopeless.
('80', 472, 3, 15, 737401) I had no talk with Mr. Jinnah on the question of Pakistan.
('80', 472, 3, 16, 737460) I believe the word ‘Pakistan’ is a convenient phrase which has been adopted by the Muslim League to cover a multitude of political and constitutional ideas.
('80', 472, 3, 17, 737617) If it means a partition of India then I do not mind saying that I am very strongly opposed to it.
('80', 472, 3, 18, 737715) If it means a reconsideration of certain political ideas and readjustment of some constitutional provisions then I should not rule out their discussion.
('80', 472, 3, 19, 737868) In any case, however, for the purpose of conversations intended to achieve a communal settlement, it would not be right for any party to impose on the other any kind of conditions precedent.
('80', 472, 3, 20, 738059) I can see no reason why Mr. Jinnah should decline to meet you.
('80', 472, 3, 21, 738122) Not only would it be rude on his part to decline to meet you but it would also put him positively in the wrong, if he were to adopt that sort of attitude.
('80', 472, 4, 22, 738277) You say in your letter that “he does not want a settlement till he has so consolidated the League position that he can dictate his terms to all the parties concerned including the rulers” and that you “often feel like writing to him but lose courage when it comes to the point of taking up my pen”.
('80', 472, 4, 23, 738576) You are, however, a man of infinite courage and you are big enough to rise superior to petty considerations of a
('80', 473, 0, 1, 738689) 474 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 473, 1, 2, 738731) conventional character.
('80', 473, 1, 3, 738755) I see no reason why you should not write to him a perfectly courteous letter—as you always do—telling him that in the interest of the country you should like to have an opportunity of meeting him and discussing the whole situation so as to see whether an honourable settlement, which will be satisfactory to all the parties concerned, is possible.
('80', 473, 1, 4, 739103) If he makes a satisfactory response, I think, you should take the step forward.
('80', 473, 1, 5, 739183) That will heighten and strengthen your position and the position of the Congress and of the Hindus at large.
('80', 473, 1, 6, 739292) If he makes no response to your request or adopts a truculent attitude that is bound to recoil on his head and on the party which he represents.
('80', 473, 1, 7, 739437) My own belief is that the farther away the parties can be from each other, the greater is the misunderstanding and the more difficult the task of reconciliation.
('80', 473, 2, 8, 739599) You then say in your letter: “But if you have faith why don’t you see him without being asked by anybody?” As a private individual I should have no objection at all to meeting him or anybody else but the real difficulty that I feel about my position is that I cannot pretend to represent the Congress or the Hindus.
('80', 473, 2, 9, 739915) I can write to him (and am quite willing to do so) suggesting that he should meet you or that if you write to him saying that you want to meet him, he should receive you and talk to you.
('80', 473, 2, 10, 740102) I should not, however, write to him without your permission.
('80', 473, 2, 11, 740163) If you will permit me, I can also write to Nawab Mohammad Ismail, who, I know, is a very good man and who, I feel, will sincerely welcome peace and harmony.
('80', 473, 2, 12, 740320) You may be sure that whether I write to Mr. Jinnah or to Nawab Ismail or to anyone, I am not going to commit you or anyone to any position.
('80', 473, 2, 13, 740460) I can only throw out a suggestion for the initiation of conversations.
('80', 473, 2, 14, 740531) Hitherto I have written no kind of letter on the subject to Mr. Jinnah or any other Muslim friend and I have scrupulously avoided during the last one year and a half writing to the Viceroy or any British official at Delhi or Simla.
('80', 473, 2, 15, 740763) Last time that I saw the Viceroy was in September 1939. Holding the views that I do, I feel verystrongly that it is no use my seeing him or writing to him in the midst of these differences, which divide one party from another and one set of politicians from another.
('80', 473, 2, 16, 741030) It is because of this feeling that both in the statement that I issued last month to the Press and in my article in the Twentieth Century I have laid emphasis on the desirability of a communal settlement and of your meeting Mr. Jinnah.
('80', 473, 2, 17, 741266) Speaking for myself I do not attach much importance to the general criticism of British policy that the Secretary of State and the Viceroy have given a veto to the minorities.
('80', 473, 2, 18, 741442) Whether they have done so or not, it is up to us to set our house in order and once we have done that, I think, we shall have gained the strength which it will be impossible on political grounds for anyone at Delhi, Simla or Whitehall to resist.
('80', 473, 3, 19, 741688) It is my misfortune that on some political questions I differ from many of my countrymen and have very strong convictions but I should do everything that lay in my power to pave the way for the communal settlement to which I attach far greater

('80', 474, 1, 2, 741980) importance than I do to mere academic discussions of this political theory or that.
('80', 474, 1, 3, 742064) In short, if you permit me, I am quite willing to write to Mr. Jinnah and some other Muslim friends.
('80', 474, 1, 4, 742165) I would much rather that you took the lead at a suitable opportunity of calling a conference than that any outsider or common friends howsoever well intentioned assumed responsibility for such a conference.
('80', 474, 1, 5, 742372) Some friends have written to me about it but I am not yet convinced that it would do any good for any private individuals to call such a conference or to wait on the Viceroy.
('80', 474, 1, 6, 742547) This must be left to you and Mr. Jinnah and I feel very strongly that if you take the lead in this matter, good may result.
('80', 474, 2, 7, 742671) With my best regards,
('80', 474, 3, 8, 742693) Yours sincerely,

('80', 474, 10, 14, 742831) February 12, 1941
('80', 474, 11, 15, 742849) DEAR MAHATMAJI,
('80', 474, 12, 16, 742865) I received your letter of the 9th of February yesterday.
('80', 474, 12, 17, 742922) I was, however, surprised to know from you that my last letter of the 6th of February had somewhat disconcerted you.
('80', 474, 12, 18, 743039) I see no reason why it should have.
('80', 474, 13, 19, 743075) In your letter of the 1st of February you say: “Qaid e Azam Jinnah says, I can only talk to him as a Hindu for Hindus.
('80', 474, 13, 20, 743194) I cannot do it.
('80', 474, 13, 21, 743210) If I write to him that I want to meet him, he won’t decline to meet me.
('80', 474, 13, 22, 743282) But I know the result.” In the present state of feeling I admit that it is quite understandable that he should think that you are the greatest stumbling block.
('80', 474, 13, 23, 743442) Towards the end of that letter you wrote to me: “But of course you should pursue the subject after your own style with whomsoever you may think fit.” This sentence led me to believe that I was at liberty to write to Jinnah in my own style and to suggest to him that he should meet you.
('80', 474, 14, 24, 743728) I am herewith enclosing a copy of my letter to Jinnah.
('80', 474, 14, 25, 743783) You will find from it that among other things I have written to him as follows: (a) “I represent neither the one party nor the other.
('80', 474, 14, 26, 743917) I can neither offer nor accept terms.
('80', 474, 14, 27, 743955) I can only appeal to you

('80', 475, 1, 2, 744138) in my individual capacity—in the capacity of one who strongly and genuinely holds that the Muslims are an integral part of India and that their willing co operation with other communities must necessarily condition the nature, extent and speed of the progress of the country.” Then I wrote to him: (b) “I think conversations, or if I may use a hackneyed phrase, heart to heart conversations, may possibly lead to some satisfactory results.”
('80', 475, 2, 3, 744579) My suggestions to him are contained in the following sentences: “I am, therefore, venturing to suggest on my own account, without committing any other person, or any other party, to my views or suggestions that (1) you should agree first to meet Mr. Gandhi, and then the process of private talks could be extended to others.
('80', 475, 2, 4, 744904) (2) If you and other leaders then think that it would serve the best interests of the country to invite a joint conference, then you all could take the necessary step.
('80', 475, 2, 5, 745072) If your reply to my suggestion is that you will be prepared to see Mr. Gandhi and talk over matters with him, I shall write to him and press it on him that he must see you at Bombay or any other place that may suit your convenience.
('80', 475, 2, 6, 745305) I hope very strongly that he will be quite willing to see you in Bombay or any other convenient place and discuss things with you.”
('80', 475, 3, 7, 745437) After careful consideration of the whole position I do not see any reason to regret the letter that I have written to Mr. Jinnah.
('80', 475, 3, 8, 745567) I could not reasonably ask him to give me the undertaking that he would certainly come to a settlement with you when you met.
('80', 475, 3, 9, 745693) The basis of a settlement is for you and him and others to decide; but in my opinion it would not be right for any party to impose any kind of conditions precedent on the other or to have any such assurances.
('80', 475, 4, 10, 745902) I do not wish my letter to him at all to interfere with any other line of action that may possibly be under contemplation or in progress; and I have, therefore, decided to drop the matter altogether.
('80', 475, 4, 11, 746102) If Mr. Jinnah writes to me any letter and if it is of a satisfactory character, I shall communicate the same to you and leave it to you to come to your own decision.
('80', 475, 4, 12, 746268) But in view of your last letter to me, I shall not, as I have said above, pursue the matter any further.
('80', 475, 5, 13, 746373) With kind regards,
('80', 475, 6, 14, 746392) Yours sincerely,

('80', 476, 1, 2, 746552) APPENDIX VI
('80', 476, 2, 3, 746564) EXTRACTS FROM “PARTING OF THE WAYS”1
('80', 476, 3, 4, 746601) In the mind and heart of India there was a conflict.
('80', 476, 3, 5, 746654) There was an intense dislike of Fascism and Nazism and no desire to see them win.
('80', 476, 3, 6, 746736) If India could but be convinced that this war was being fought for a new world order, for real freedom, then indeed India would throw all her weight and strength into it.
('80', 476, 3, 7, 746907) But imperialism and we were old acquaintances, very old, with many generations of contact.
('80', 476, 3, 8, 746998) We knew each other, suspected each other, and disliked each other thoroughly.
('80', 476, 3, 9, 747076) There was this background of one hundred and eighty years of hostility, of exploitation, of bitterness, of promises unfulfilled, of disruptive and reactionary movements encouraged, and attempts to break up the national unity of India.
('80', 476, 3, 10, 747311) It was no easy matter for us to get over these tremendous hurdles, or remove the complexes that had grown up.
('80', 476, 3, 11, 747421) Yet we said we would do it, but we could not even attempt it unless a great psychological shock was given to the people, a pleasant shock, which would suddenly change the air of India and get rid of fears and complexes.
('80', 476, 3, 12, 747641) That pleasant shock could only come by an unequivocal declaration of independence and immediate steps to give effect to the popular will in the carrying on of the administration.
('80', 476, 3, 13, 747820) Unless this was done, no man in India, nor group, could make the people move in the direction of willing association with the war.
('80', 476, 3, 14, 747951) Wars today required mass support and even authoritarian countries have to whip up their people by ceaseless propaganda.
('80', 476, 3, 15, 748071) No war can be fought effectively by a professional army in an atmosphere of public ill will or indifference.
('80', 476, 3, 16, 748180) So even from the narrower point of view of organizing India’s defence or India’s participation in the war effort, a popular representative government was essential.
('80', 476, 3, 17, 748345) Imperialism can coerce; it cannot win public approval and goodwill.
('80', 476, 4, 18, 748413) I repeat that it is incorrect to say that there is any new parting of the ways, for our ways never lay together.
('80', 476, 4, 19, 748526) But this declaration of the British Government means the final breaking of such slender bonds as held our minds together, it means the ending of all hope that we shall ever march together.
('80', 476, 4, 20, 748715) I am sorry, for in spite of my hostility to British imperialism and all imperialisms, I have loved much that was England, and I should have liked to keep the silken bonds of the spirit between India and England.
('80', 476, 4, 21, 748927) Those bonds can only exist in freedom.
('80', 476, 4, 22, 748966) I wanted India’s freedom for India’s sake of course; but I also wanted it for England’s sake.
('80', 476, 4, 23, 749060) That hope is shattered and fate seems to have fashioned a different future for us.
('80', 476, 4, 24, 749143) The way of co operation is not for us; the hundred year old hostility will remain and grow in future conflicts, and the breach when it comes, as come it must, will also not be in friendship but in hostility.
('80', 476, 5, 25, 749351) The British Government says, it will not coerce an important group to impose

('80', 477, 1, 2, 749515) a system of government which this does not like.
('80', 477, 1, 3, 749564) The alternative surely is that it will coerce other groups who want that particular system of government.
('80', 477, 1, 4, 749670) What exactly has the function of the British Government been, and what is it today, in India?
('80', 477, 1, 5, 749764) It is to coerce the Indian people as a whole, every group, in order to maintain its own hold and special position.
('80', 477, 1, 6, 749879) It is to suppress Indian industry in favour of British industry in India.
('80', 477, 1, 7, 749953) It is to maintain an army of occupation whose chief function is to coerce the Indian people.
('80', 477, 1, 8, 750046) It is to uphold Indian princes by coercing their subjects into submission.
('80', 477, 1, 9, 750121) It is strange to be told that the British Government does not want to we coercion.
('80', 477, 1, 10, 750204) What else does it do in India?
('80', 477, 2, 11, 750235) That is the goal of India—a united, free, democratic country, closely associated in a world federation with other free nations.
('80', 477, 2, 12, 750363) We want independence, but not the old type of narrow, exclusive independence.
('80', 477, 2, 13, 750441) We believe that the day of separate warring national State is over.

('80', 477, 7, 18, 750620) DEAR MR. YOUNGS
('80', 477, 8, 19, 750636) On return to Warda I have had some talk with Gandhiji over our correspondence about the restarting of the Harijan.
('80', 477, 8, 20, 750751) Shri Srinivasan was also here, especially to urge Gandhi to restart it.
('80', 477, 8, 21, 750823) And it is after some deliberation that I am writing this.
('80', 477, 9, 22, 750881) While there is in the correspondence little to encourage us to revive the Harijan, there is no doubt that there was enough in our informal talks—both between you and me, and between Sir Richard Tottenham and Shri Srinivasan —which could help a favourable decision.
('80', 477, 9, 23, 751146) Above all there is the urgent desire of Shri Srinivasan and many of the members of the Standing Committee, as also of the general reading public, which Gandhiji cannot possibly ignore.
('80', 477, 9, 24, 751331) He has, therefore, come to the concl usion that it would now be discourteous, if not improper, not to comply with the wish so generally expressed.
('80', 477, 9, 25, 751478) We propose to bring out the first issue on the 29th March.
('80', 477, 10, 26, 751537) But before we do so, I owe it to you to tell you again that both Gandhiji and I are completely identified with the satyagraha movement, and our editing of the Harijan cannot but bear the colour and impress of that identification, though it will be solely with a view to keeping the spirit of non violence alive in a world of strife and

('80', 478, 1, 4, 752091) I will not misunderstand it, and say nothing in public about it, for the simple reason that I have not yet announced the decision to restart the paper.

('80', 478, 6, 9, 752312) NON PARTY LEADERS’ CONFERENCE RESOLUTION1
('80', 478, 7, 10, 752354) March 14, 1941
('80', 478, 8, 11, 752369) While India should not take advantage of Britain’s difficulties in her heroic struggle, the Conference is equally desirous that India’s domestic problems should not be pressed to her disadvantage.
('80', 478, 8, 12, 752566) As a first step towards the removal of the present deadlock and until a permanent constitution is brought into force, the Conference desires to emphasize the immediate need for the reconstruction of the Governor General’s Executive Council.
('80', 478, 9, 13, 752807) The Conference considers that the present Council, which consists of three European members of the Indian Civil Service, and three Indians of whom two are non officials and one is a member of the Indian Civil Service, in addition to His Excellency the Viceroy and His Excellency the Commander in Chief, is neither adequate nor sufficiently representative to organize and direct India’s war efforts at this moment of grave period.
('80', 478, 9, 14, 753237) This Conference is anxious that India’s defences should be put on a firm basis and that resources of this great country in men and material should be used to the fullest advantage not only for defending her own frontiers but for helping the British people to the fullest extent possible consistently with the best interests of India.
('80', 478, 10, 15, 753571) For the reasons mentioned above, this Conference is of the opinion that the whole Executive Council should consist of non official Indians drawn from important elements in the public life of the country.
('80', 478, 10, 16, 753775) This would naturally involve the transfer of all portfolios, including the vital ones of finance and defence, to Indians.
('80', 478, 11, 17, 753897) The Conference would be content during the period of the war that the reconstructed centre remains responsible to the Crown, and so far as defence is concerned, the position of the Commander in Chief as the Executive head of the defence forces of the country should not be in any way prejudiced.
('80', 478, 11, 18, 754193) At the same time

('80', 479, 0, 1, 754244) 480 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 479, 1, 2, 754286) the Conference is strongly of the view that the reconstructed Government should not merely be a collection of departmental heads, but should deal with all important matters of policy on a basis of joint and collective responsibility.
('80', 479, 1, 3, 754520) In regard to all interimperial and international matters, the reconstructed Government should be treated on the same footing as the Dominion Governments.
('80', 479, 2, 4, 754674) The Conference is further of the opinion that with a view to create a favourable atmosphere for the working of the reconstructed Central Government, it is necessary to remove the doubts and misgivings of the people of this country as regards the genuineness of the intentions of His Majesty’s Government by making a declaration simultaneously with the reconstruction of the Government that within a specified time limit after the conclusion of the war, India will enjoy the same measure of freedom as will be enjoyed by Britain and the Dominions.
('80', 479, 3, 5, 755221) The Conference authorizes its President, the Rt.
('80', 479, 3, 6, 755270) Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru to communicate the terms of the resolution to His Excellency the Viceroy and the Secretary of State for India and to take such other steps as may be necessary to achieve its objects.

('80', 479, 8, 11, 755632) DEAR MR. MAHADEV DESAI,
('80', 479, 9, 12, 755656) Mr. Desmond Young has shown me the correspondence 2 which he has had with you about the publication of the Harijan and it will, I think, be convenient if I make the position of the Government of India clear.
('80', 479, 9, 13, 755864) In the first place, there is no question of Government advising against publication.
('80', 479, 9, 14, 755949) The decision whether or not to resume publication of the Harijan, must of course be entirely a matter for Mr. Gandhi himself, and is one which the Government are not concerned to influence in any way.
('80', 479, 9, 15, 756150) In the second place, you are of course aware of the limits imposed by the Defence of India Rules on the publication of news or comment which may fall within their mischief; and you will not, I am certain, misunderstand me if I add, in the most friendly way, that these Rules must necessarily be of general application.
('80', 479, 9, 16, 756469) I am, however, glad to

('80', 480, 7, 8, 757005) [On or before March 30 1941]2
('80', 480, 8, 9, 757035) GANDHIJI: Shall I congratulate you upon your defence and acquittal in appeal ?
('80', 480, 9, 10, 757114) RUIKAR: I have not been able to understand the fundamental difference between you and Sjt.
('80', 480, 9, 11, 757205) Subhas Bose.
('80', 480, 10, 12, 757218) G. Is it not clear in the first letter of Mr. Bose which he wrote to me ?
('80', 480, 11, 13, 757292) R. No, it is not clear to me.
('80', 480, 12, 14, 757322) G. The fundamental difference is about non violence.
('80', 480, 13, 15, 757375) R. So far as the present struggle is concerned, Sjt.
('80', 480, 13, 16, 757428) Bose and the Forward Bloc agree that it has to be carried on non violently.
('80', 480, 14, 17, 757504) Non violence means that you must believe in the emblem of non violence—which is charkha, Hindu Muslim unity and removal of untouchability.
('80', 480, 15, 18, 757643) R. So far as the last two items are concerned, we believe in them.
('80', 480, 16, 19, 757710) The real emblem of non violence is the charkha which Sjt.
('80', 480, 16, 20, 757768) Bose ridicules.
('80', 480, 17, 21, 757784) R. What about Pandit Jawaharlal and Maulana Azad?
('80', 480, 18, 22, 757834) G. But Pandit Jawaharlal has agreed to abide by all the conditions imposed by me.
('80', 480, 18, 23, 757916) It was only when he agreed and conveyed his acceptance that I allowed him to be the second satyagrahi.
('80', 480, 18, 24, 758019) Even now he sends reports from jail that he is regularly spinning and has therefore faith in the charkha, so far at least as the present struggle is concerned.
('80', 480, 19, 25, 758179) R. Suppose a man has faith in non violence and is prepared to work for Hindu Muslim unity and removal of untouchability but does not believe in charkha would you say that this is a fundamental difference between him and you ?

('80', 481, 1, 2, 758641) If I am the General of the Army, I choose my own emblem, and, so far as I am concerned, charkha is the emblem of non violence.
('80', 481, 2, 3, 758768) R. Gandhiji, your philosophy of non violence is a world philosophy and world policy, would you put Hindu Muslim unity as one of the emblems in America or England?
('80', 481, 3, 4, 758931) G. No; obviously it could not be.
('80', 481, 3, 5, 758965) So far as India is concerned, the emblem of non violence is charkha and one who wants to join the army must accept the condition of the General.
('80', 481, 4, 6, 759110) R. Mahatmaji, do you not contemplate some compromise with the Muslim League at some stage or other?
('80', 481, 5, 7, 759210) G. Yes.
('80', 481, 6, 8, 759218) R. Do you expect the Muslim League to accept charkha as the emblem of non violence and to co operate with them?
('80', 481, 8, 9, 759330) R. On what condition will you have compromise with the League?
('80', 481, 9, 10, 759393) G. On common grounds on which we can work together.
('80', 481, 10, 11, 759445) R. Don’t you agree with me that there are more common grounds of agreement with Sjt.
('80', 481, 10, 12, 759530) Subhas Bose and the Forward Bloc than with the Muslim League ?
('80', 481, 11, 13, 759593) G. Yes; I agree that there are more common grounds of agreement between Sjt.
('80', 481, 11, 14, 759670) Bose and me than between the League and me; but because Sjt.
('80', 481, 11, 15, 759731) Bose insists on working inside the Congress, I cannot work with him.
('80', 481, 11, 16, 759800) If he goes out of the Congress, then there will be more common grounds of agreement between us.
('80', 481, 12, 17, 759896) R. Are we to understand that the only hope of co operation with Sjt.
('80', 481, 12, 18, 759965) Subhas Bose is that he should go out of the Congress?
('80', 481, 13, 19, 760019) G. Yes; I admire him as a great man and if he is out of the Congress, there will be more chances of co operation with him than if he is inside the Congress.

('80', 482, 3, 4, 760438) June 17, 1941
('80', 482, 4, 5, 760452) 1. A released satyagrahi must seek to offer satyagraha as soon as possible.
('80', 482, 4, 6, 760528) If for any reason he is unable to do so he must apply through the President or officer in charge of the Provincial Congress Committee for exemption from Mahatma Gandhi and he should state the reasons for such exemption being granted.
('80', 482, 5, 7, 760762) 2. From the date on which the name of a prospective satyagrahi is forwarded to Mahatma Gandhi for sanction, he is to suspend his private activities and devote himself wholly to working out one or more items of the following thirteenfold items of the constructive programme:
('80', 482, 6, 8, 761036) (a) Hindu Muslim or communal unity.
('80', 482, 7, 9, 761072) (b) Removal of untouchability.
('80', 482, 8, 10, 761103) (c) Prohibition.
('80', 482, 9, 11, 761120) (d) Khadi.
('80', 482, 10, 12, 761131) (e) Other village industries.
('80', 482, 11, 13, 761161) (f) Village sanitation.
('80', 482, 12, 14, 761185) (g) New or Basic Education.
('80', 482, 13, 15, 761213) (h) Adult education.
('80', 482, 14, 16, 761234) (i) Uplift of women.
('80', 482, 15, 17, 761255) (j) Education in hygiene and health.
('80', 482, 16, 18, 761292) (k) The propagation of Rashtrabhasha.
('80', 482, 17, 19, 761330) (I) Cultivating love of one’s own language.
('80', 482, 18, 20, 761374) (m) Working for economic equality.
('80', 482, 19, 21, 761409) 3. Every prospective satyagrahi is expected to keep a diary in which he will enter the work done by him during the day and this diary will be submitted to the Provincial Congress Committee concerned at fortnightly intervals.
('80', 482, 19, 22, 761634) Permission to offer satyagraha shall be granted only to such workers who have proved their worth by their everyday work.
('80', 482, 20, 23, 761755) 4. The new restrictions in passing lists of satyagrahis are considered necessary in the interest of the struggle as it is likely to develop in future and will become progressively more arduous.
('80', 482, 20, 24, 761949) New satyagrahis that come in should, therefore, be such as can stand the new test.
('80', 482, 20, 25, 762032) Complaints have been received in the office of undue delay in passing names.
('80', 482, 20, 26, 762109) Those who have given their names need not, however, feel impatient at the delay.
('80', 482, 20, 27, 762190) They should devote the interval to carrying out the

('80', 483, 0, 1, 762291) 484 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 483, 1, 2, 762333) If any satyagrahi who has enrolled himself on the original basis feels unable to accept the new terms, he is free to withdraw his name and there will be no disgrace attached to any such withdrawal.
('80', 483, 1, 3, 762531) He may continue to render whatever other service he can to the country.
('80', 483, 1, 4, 762603) He remains a Congressman as before.
('80', 483, 2, 5, 762639) 5. Enrolled satyagrahis cannot contest elections to the local bodies.
('80', 483, 2, 6, 762709) Those who have put in their candidature for such elections, before being enlisted as satyagrahis, have either to withdraw from election or from offering satyagraha.
('80', 483, 2, 7, 762874) As satyagrahis they cannot be in both places.
('80', 483, 3, 8, 762920) 6. No released satyagrahi who is a member of a local board, unless specially exempted by Mahatma Gandhi, can attend its meeting.
('80', 483, 3, 9, 763049) If he does, his name will be expunged from the list of satyagrahis.
('80', 483, 4, 10, 763117) 7. Unarrested satyagrahis who are touring in their districts and those whose names have been approved are not to attend meetings of local bodies.
('80', 483, 5, 11, 763263) 8. During the monsoons a satyagrahi may, if necessary, establish himself in a village, not his own, or a group of villages and carry on satyagraha and constructive activities.
('80', 483, 6, 12, 763439) 9. Unarrested satyagrahis, either touring in their districts or marching in the direction of Delhi, should send fortnightly reports of their work to the provincial office.
('80', 483, 6, 13, 763611) The Provincial Congress Committees in turn will send a consolidated report of their work to the All India Congress Committee office at stated intervals, fortnightly or monthly.
('80', 483, 7, 14, 763788) 10. Complaints have been received about the intemperance of language of certain satyagrahis.
('80', 483, 7, 15, 763881) Satyagrahis should know that vituperation and abuse are against both the spirit and letter of satyagraha and must, therefore, be invariably avoided.

('80', 483, 14, 24, 764460) Those (Congressmen) who favour violent resistance (by way of self defence)
('80', 483, 15, 25, 764535) 1 Vide “Letter to K. M. Munshi”, 29 5 1941 and “Statement to the Press”, 15 6 1941
('80', 484, 0, 1, 764618) VOL. 80 : 28 DECEMBER, 1940 17 AUGUST, 1941 485
('80', 484, 1, 2, 764666) Those (Congressmen) who favour violent resistance (by way of self defence) must get out of the Congress and shape their conduct just as they think fit and guide others accordingly.
('80', 484, 2, 3, 764847) A Congressman may not directly or indirectly associate himself with gymnasia where training in violent resistance is given.
('80', 484, 3, 4, 764971) Forgive me if I cannot reconcile myself to these injunctions.
('80', 484, 3, 5, 765033) Since Pakistan has been in action at Dacca, Ahmedabad, Bombay and other places, it is clear that such riots are going to be the normal feature of our life for some years.
('80', 484, 3, 6, 765204) If war comes to India’s frontiers or the British machinery of maintaining order weakens, they will perhaps grow more frequent and intense if a division of India is sought to be enforced by internal or external agencies through organized violence.
('80', 484, 3, 7, 765451) If life, home and shrine and honour of women is threatened by goondaism, organized resistance in self defence appears to me to be a paramount and inalienable duty, whatever form such resistance may take.
('80', 484, 3, 8, 765655) Do you include akhadas in the gymnasia where training in violent resistance is given?
('80', 484, 3, 9, 765741) I may inform you that for the last fifteen years and more I have been associated with the akhada movement in the presidency, both directly and indirectly.
('80', 484, 3, 10, 765896) I presided over two conferences, one at Bombay and the other at Poona to organize it on systematic lines.
('80', 484, 3, 11, 766002) I have still unofficial connections with several akhadas.
('80', 484, 3, 12, 766060) I deem them an essential machinery for training our race in the art of self defence.
('80', 484, 3, 13, 766145) During the last many years they have played a great part in giving us some self confidence to resist goondaism.
('80', 484, 3, 14, 766257) In spite of the great efforts which I have made since yesterday, I have failed to convince myself that my views as expressed in an article I wrote a fortnight ago and published in the Social Welfare of the 22nd May, 1941, require a revision.
('80', 484, 3, 15, 766499) I am sending you a copy of the article for ready reference.
('80', 484, 4, 16, 766559) Since I came to you in 1930, you have been more to me than a political leader.
('80', 484, 4, 17, 766638) You have been to the whole of our family a father.
('80', 484, 4, 18, 766689) You have been a beacon for the last ten years lighting me on the path of the little spirituality that I can lay claim to.
('80', 484, 4, 19, 766811) Hence the pain I feel in confessing that I have searched in vain for a way out of this conflict.
('80', 484, 4, 20, 766908) I can, of course, keep quiet or can acquiesce in what you say or can, for fear of losing my Congress association and your confidence—both precious possessions of my life— voice your sentiments and go my way or do nothing.
('80', 484, 4, 21, 767130) But something in me rebels against such a course.
('80', 484, 4, 22, 767180) You have been to me the embodiment of truth and I would lose my self respect, my right to pray to God, if I pretend to follow you with such mental reservations.
('80', 484, 4, 23, 767341) I cannot pledge myself not to preach, hold, organize or sympathize with organized resistance to violence in self defence by all possible means.
('80', 484, 4, 24, 767485) I do not want to be dishonest to myself nor to the country whose integrity is now threatened, nor do I desire to deny myself your inspiration and guidance in this dilemma.
('80', 484, 4, 25, 767657) Please let me know what I should do.
('80', 484, 5, 26, 767694) My wife is leaving Naini Tal on the 28th and has already written to you.
('80', 484, 5, 27, 767767) I am leaving again for Kausani.
('80', 484, 5, 28, 767799) I will start from here on June 9 and will be in Bombay on the 11th.
('80', 484, 5, 29, 767867) Will the 12th or the 13th suit you to see me at Sevagram?
('80', 484, 5, 30, 767925) My eyes are still

('80', 485, 6, 7, 768105) RABINDRANATH TAGORE’S REPLY TO ELEANOR RATHBONE1
('80', 485, 7, 8, 768154) SANTINIKETAN, June 4, 1941
('80', 485, 8, 9, 768181) I have been deeply pained at Miss Rathbone’s open letter to Indians.
('80', 485, 8, 10, 768250) I do not know who Miss Rathbone is, but I take it that she represents the mentality of the average ‘well intentioned’ Britisher.
('80', 485, 8, 11, 768379) Her letter is mainly addressed to Jawaharlal and I have no doubt that if that noble fighter of freedom’s battle had not been gagged behind prison bars by Miss Rathbone’s countrymen, he would have made a fitting and spirited reply to her gratuitous sermon.
('80', 485, 8, 12, 768635) His enforced silence makes it necessary for me to voice my protest even from my sick bed.
('80', 485, 9, 13, 768725) The lady has ill served the cause of her people by addressing so indiscreet, indeed impertinent, a challenge to our conscience.
('80', 485, 9, 14, 768853) She is scandalized at our ingratitude,—that having “drunk deeply at the wells of English thought” we should still have some thought left for our poor country’s interests.
('80', 485, 9, 15, 769024) English thought, in so far as it is representative of the best traditions of Western enlightenment, has Indeed taught us much, but let me add, those of our countrymen who have profited by it have done so despite the official British attempts to ill educate us.
('80', 485, 9, 16, 769285) We might have achieved introduction to Western learning through any other European language.
('80', 485, 9, 17, 769378) Have all the other peoples in the world waited for the British to bring them enlightenment?
('80', 485, 10, 18, 769470) It is sheer insolent self complacence on the part of our so called English friends to assume that had they not ‘taught’ us we would still have remained in the dark ages.
('80', 485, 10, 19, 769640) Through the official British channels of education in India have flowed to our children in schools not the best of English thought but its refuse, which has only deprived them of wholesome repast at the table of their own culture.
('80', 485, 11, 20, 769871) Assuming, however, that the English language is the only channel left to us for “enlightenment”, all that “drinking deeply at its wells” has come to is that in 1931, even after a couple of centuries of British administration, only about one per cent of the population was found to be literate in English,—while in the U.S.S.R. in 1932, after only fifteen years of Soviet administration, 98 per cent of the children were educated.
('80', 485, 11, 21, 770301) (These figures are taken from The Statesman’s Year Book, an English
('80', 485, 12, 22, 770369) 1 Vide “Letter to D. K. Gosavi”, 8 6 1941
('80', 486, 0, 1, 770411) VOL. 80 : 28 DECEMBER, 1940 17 AUGUST, 1941 487
('80', 486, 1, 2, 770459) publication, not likely to err on the Russian side.)
('80', 486, 2, 3, 770512) But even more necessary than the so called culture are the bare elementary needs of existence, on which alone can any super structure of enlightenment rest.
('80', 486, 2, 4, 770669) And what have the British who have held tight the purse strings of our nation for more than two centuries and exploited its resources done for our poor people?
('80', 486, 3, 5, 770829) I look around and see famished bodies crying for bread.
('80', 486, 3, 6, 770885) I have seen women in villages dig up mud for a few drops of drinking water; for wells are even more scarce in Indian villages than schools.
('80', 486, 3, 7, 771025) I know that the population of England itself is today in danger of starvation and I sympathize with them, but when I see how the whole might of the British navy is engaged in convoying food vessels to the English shores and when I recollect that I have seen our people perish of hunger and not even a cart load of rice brought to their door from the neighbouring district, I cannot help contrasting the British at home with the British in India.
('80', 486, 3, 8, 771471) Shall we then be grateful to the British, if not for keeping us fed, at least for preserving law and order?
('80', 486, 3, 9, 771579) I look around and see riots raging all over the country.
('80', 486, 3, 10, 771636) When scores of Indian lives are lost, our property looted, our women dishonoured, the mighty British arms stir in no action, only the British voice is raised from overseas to chide us for our unfitness to put our house in order.
('80', 486, 4, 11, 771865) Examples are not wanting in history when even fully armed warriors have shrunk before superior might and contingencies have arisen in the present war when the bravest among the British, French and Greek soldiers have had to evacuate the battle field in Europe because they were overwhelmed by superior armaments—but when our poor, unarmed and helpless peasants, encumbered with crying babes, flee from homes unable to protect them from armed goondas, the British officials perhaps smile in contempt at our cowardice.
('80', 486, 5, 12, 772382) Every British civilian in England is armed today for protecting his hearth and home against the enemy, but in India even lathi training was forbidden by decree.
('80', 486, 5, 13, 772543) Our people have been deliberately disarmed and emasculated in order to keep them perpetually cowed and at the mercy of their armed masters.
('80', 486, 5, 14, 772683) The British hate the Nazis for merely challenging their world mastery and Miss Rathbone expects us to kiss the hand of her people in servility for having riveted chains on ours.
('80', 486, 5, 15, 772861) A government mustbe judged not by the pretensions of its spokesmen but by its actual and effective contribution to the well being of the people.
('80', 486, 6, 16, 773006) It is not so much because the British are foreigners that they are unwelcome to us and have found no place in our hearts as because while pretending to be trustees of our welfare they have betrayed the great trust and have sacrificed the happiness of millions of India to bloat the pockets of a few capitalists at home.
('80', 486, 6, 17, 773326) I should have thought that the decent Britisher would at least keep silent at these wrongs and be grateful to us for our inaction, but that he should add insult to injury and pour salt over our wounds passes all bounds of decency.

('80', 487, 2, 3, 773654) DISCUSSION WITH K. M. MUNSHI AND OTHERS1
('80', 487, 3, 4, 773695) (9 to 11 a.m.) June 12, 1941
('80', 487, 4, 5, 773724) MUNSHI: (a) War is coming on India’s frontiers, when the internal machinery of order will be weakened.
('80', 487, 5, 6, 773827) (b) Pakistan is in action and will be so for some time in the shape of premeditated riots.
('80', 487, 6, 7, 773918) (c) Pakistan can only be conceded on our dead bodies.
('80', 487, 7, 8, 773972) (d) The question of freedom and of the territorial integrity of India are academic.
('80', 487, 7, 9, 774056) The real question is whether in the coming years of trouble we will have strength enough to protect our homes, lives, etc., from internal disturbances.
('80', 487, 8, 10, 774208) (e) Few Congressmen can follow the programme of self immolation.
('80', 487, 8, 11, 774273) I will only lead to hypocrisy in the Congress or make other elements more powerful.
('80', 487, 9, 12, 774357) (f) If Congressmen can’t take any part in this way, then what are they to do?
('80', 487, 9, 13, 774435) They must cease to play any effective part in the most acute problem of the day.
('80', 487, 10, 14, 774516) Gandhiji discussed the general situation.
('80', 487, 10, 15, 774558) (12 Noon)
('80', 487, 11, 16, 774568) GANDHIJI: (a) I do not expect any settlement with Government.
('80', 487, 12, 17, 774630) (b) Jinnah is not likely to settle; and the riots will grow.
('80', 487, 13, 18, 774691) (c) Congress as constituted at present can have no place in riots.
('80', 487, 13, 19, 774758) At the same time it will be extinct if it does not tackle the riot situation.
('80', 487, 14, 20, 774836) (d) If I continue, with even some men, it may enable the masses, in a conceivable event when they are tired of the present methods, to seek me outfor a solution.
('80', 487, 14, 21, 774998) Anyway, we may leave behind us a tradition which will help the country in future.
('80', 487, 15, 22, 775080) (e) Any attempt to organize violent self defense will attract an attack on the Congress by Government.
('80', 487, 15, 23, 775183) The problem is an all India one and cannot be ignored.
('80', 487, 16, 24, 775238) MUNSHI: I do not want to part from you.
('80', 487, 16, 25, 775278) But you should tell me what I should do in view of my limitations and the situation.
('80', 487, 17, 26, 775363) GANDHIJI: As for the Congress some people must get out to have a free hand.
('80', 487, 17, 27, 775439) It will be dangerous for the organization to do anything in the riots, for it will give Government an opportunity to destroy it.
('80', 487, 17, 28, 775568) (3.00 to 5.00 p.m.)
('80', 487, 18, 29, 775588) Rajendra Babu and Mathura Babu described the conditions in Bihar.
('80', 487, 19, 30, 775654) RAJENDRA BABU: (a) I am losing my hold over Bihar.
('80', 487, 20, 31, 775705) (b) The Muslims are frankly aggressive.
('80', 487, 21, 32, 775745) 1 Vide”Statement to the Press”, 15 6 1941
('80', 488, 0, 1, 775787) VOL. 80 : 28 DECEMBER, 1940 17 AUGUST, 1941 489
('80', 488, 1, 2, 775835) (c) The Hindus are equally aggressive, and are organizing themselves.
('80', 488, 2, 3, 775905) (d) The Hindu Mahasabha is gaining ground.
('80', 488, 3, 4, 775948) (e) The Peace Brigade does not appeal to Congressmen and few will be found to follow it.
('80', 488, 4, 5, 776037) GANDHIJI: I admit that the Peace Brigade idea is not likely to attract Congressmen.
('80', 488, 4, 6, 776121) Even Mahadev has got no response in Ahmedabad so far.
('80', 488, 5, 7, 776175) Shri Gopichand Bhargava described the position in Punjab.
('80', 488, 6, 8, 776233) RAJENDRA BABU: These are preliminary skirmishes, in my opinion, to see how the Muslim community is affected.
('80', 488, 6, 9, 776342) Very soon, the full force of the campaign will perhaps begin.
('80', 488, 7, 10, 776404) MUNSHI: It’s a civil war.
('80', 488, 7, 11, 776430) An effective part must be played by the Congress.
('80', 488, 8, 12, 776480) RAJENDRA BABU: Not a single Mussalman leader is coming forward to condemn the Muslim atrocities, nor will he join in saying that we should immolate ourselves.
('80', 488, 8, 13, 776639) (9.30 to 11.00 a.m., June 13, 1941)
('80', 488, 9, 14, 776675) GANDHIJI: (a) Congress as an institution cannot organize violent self defence.
('80', 488, 10, 15, 776754) (b) At the same time it may become necessary for the Congress to encourage the efforts of those who conscientiously believe that this ‘war’ should be stopped in some other way.
('80', 488, 11, 16, 776931) (c) He can always insist on force being used in self defence or in a decent manner.
('80', 488, 11, 17, 777015) For instance, shrines, women and children may not be touched in any case.
('80', 488, 12, 18, 777089) Dr. Gopichand then stated the Punjab situation.
('80', 488, 13, 19, 777137) In the Punjab, the northern part is predominantly Muslim, central Sikh, eastern Hindu.
('80', 488, 13, 20, 777224) So there is scarcely any equality.
('80', 488, 13, 21, 777259) But the real quarrel is between agriculturists and non agriculturists.
('80', 488, 13, 22, 777330) Muslim attitude discussed.
('80', 488, 13, 23, 777357) (2.30 p.m.)
('80', 488, 14, 24, 777369) Discussed the reaction of leading Muslim Congressmen to the modification of the principle of non violent defence in (a) international matters and (b) in domestic disputes.
('80', 488, 15, 25, 777541) GANDHIJI: Maulana accepted that violent defence is necessary in (a) but would not accept it for (b).
('80', 488, 16, 26, 777642) GOPICHAND BHARGAVA: Asaf Ali had said that Gandhiji’s letter 1 regarding non violent self defence to Bhogilal was not a correct interpretation of the Congress creed, which only dealt with the movement for swaraj, not with internal affairs.
('80', 488, 17, 27, 777882) GANDHIJI: But he sided with Maulana in opposing the use of violent defence in internal matters.
('80', 488, 18, 28, 777978) MUNSHI: They don’t want the Congress Hindus to defend violently; they can’t stop the Muslims from violent aggression.
('80', 488, 18, 29, 778096) The result is that the Hindus will be

('80', 489, 0, 1, 778178) 490 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('80', 489, 1, 2, 778220) divided and unable to oppose the Muslims in a civil war.
('80', 489, 2, 3, 778277) RAJENDRA BABU: The Muslim Congressmen now outside may be consulted.
('80', 489, 3, 4, 778345) GANDHIJI: It is not necessary.
('80', 489, 3, 5, 778376) Khan Saheb is for pure non violence; Maulana also is.
('80', 489, 4, 6, 778430) Bombay position discussed.
('80', 489, 5, 7, 778457) GANDHIJI: I have thought over the whole question.
('80', 489, 5, 8, 778507) For Munshi the path is this:
('80', 489, 6, 9, 778536) (a) If he can throw himself heart and soul in the Peace Brigade, he would be able to work it up very well.
('80', 489, 7, 10, 778643) (b) If he can’t he may retire into the Himalayas or somewhere for a few months and watch the situation and find out what way his mind works and whether he could adopt the first course.
('80', 489, 8, 11, 778828) (c) If he comes to the conclusion that the first course is not possible, he should leave the Congress and organize the Hindus for violent self defence.
('80', 489, 8, 12, 778980) Whatever course you may take, our personal relations will remain the same and I will take the same interest in you as now.
('80', 489, 9, 13, 779103) MUNSHI: As you know my attachment for you, I do not want to part from you.
('80', 489, 9, 14, 779178) I will think over the alternatives with my wife and let you know.
('80', 489, 9, 15, 779244) But of one thing I am positive; I cannot retire in the way you mention.
('80', 489, 9, 16, 779316) I am in public life for years.
('80', 489, 9, 17, 779347) When God willed that I should be out of jail at this time when I feel my country, community and culture are in danger, I cannot forgive myself if I shrink back.
('80', 489, 9, 18, 779508) (I broke down here.)
('80', 489, 10, 19, 779529) That is out of question.
('80', 489, 10, 20, 779554) If, however, you think that the interest of the Congress or the country requires my abstention from public life I am willing (a) to go back to jail; or
('80', 489, 11, 21, 779706) (b) retire into exclusive professional activities.
('80', 489, 12, 22, 779757) GANDHIJI: I do not want you to go to jail nor to retire into practice,
('80', 489, 13, 23, 779828) MUNSHI: Then as regards the first course, my whole being protests against the idea.
('80', 489, 13, 24, 779912) If I undertake it, I must take it up thoroughly and offer myself at the first instance.
('80', 489, 13, 25, 780000) I feel that I can’t do it: (a) I haven’t that spiritual strength; (b) I know it’s useless and I won’t take it up hypocritically.
('80', 489, 13, 26, 780129) My inner urge is my country and culture are in danger.
('80', 489, 13, 27, 780184) I want to fight for them, so far as I can, though I know it won’t be much, as I have neither the health nor the ability to do anything effective.
('80', 489, 13, 28, 780330) But I will struggle to acquire the necessary spirituality for the first course.
('80', 489, 14, 29, 780410) (c) Bombay Congressmen still believe that Gandhiji will work a miracle; Congress will get into power; so they must retain their vested interest.
('80', 489, 15, 30, 780555) (d) Scarcely anyone will be found to immolate himself.
('80', 489, 16, 31, 780610) (e) Several Congressmen helped and do help new organizations which defend their localities violently.

('80', 490, 4, 5, 781195) GANDHIJI: If Munshi can’t take to the first course, it is in the interests of the Congress that he should go out and do as he is prompted to do.
('80', 490, 4, 6, 781340) I will issue a statement 1 to clear his position.
('80', 490, 4, 7, 781390) He should also discuss the matters with his Congress friends and see whether they would join him in going out and organizing defence.

('80', 490, 6, 9, 781615) Gandhiji was inclined to the view that the Congress workers in Bombay should consider whether they want the right of violent self defence.
('80', 490, 6, 10, 781754) Rajendra Babu pointed out that that would destroy the integrity of the Congress.
('80', 490, 7, 11, 781835) Munshi concurred.
('80', 490, 7, 12, 781853) The idea was given up.

('80', 490, 15, 22, 782301) K. M. MUNSHI’S STATEMENT1
('80', 490, 16, 23, 782327) I had the benefit of detailed discussion with Gandhiji and many friends on the present situation in the country.
('80', 490, 16, 24, 782440) After mature deliberation, I feel that the interests of the country demand that, with my views on the question of self defence, I should not continue any longer to be a member of the Congress.
('80', 490, 16, 25, 782633) Any other course would neither be honourable for me nor fair to the country or the Congress.
('80', 490, 16, 26, 782726) Gandhiji would not think of my offering satyagraha in the present uncertain and enfeebled condition of my health.
('80', 490, 16, 27, 782840) I could not think of working a Peace Brigade in Bombay, not having the requisite spiritual strength.
('80', 490, 16, 28, 782941) At the same time to pursue any work other than that of helping to arrest the progress of the blood feud that is going on before one’s eyes is flying away from duty.
('80', 490, 16, 29, 783106) I feel that in the dark days which lie ahead of India I would be of no use to the country unless I pursued the path of duty in

('80', 491, 1, 2, 783327) the light which God has been pleased to vouchsafe to me.
('80', 491, 1, 3, 783384) This decision has been rendered rather difficult by the personal bond which subsists between Gandhiji and several leading Congressmen on the one hand and myself [on the other], but I would not be worthy of their confidence if I remained in the Congress with a mental reservation on the cardinal point of Congress faith as Gandhiji understands it.
('80', 491, 1, 4, 783731) My only satisfaction has been that Gandhiji, with his usual generosity, has helped me to reach a decision which is consistent with my own view as to the direction in which immediate duty lies.

('80', 491, 4, 7, 783966) “MR. GANDHI’S ADMISSION”1
('80', 491, 5, 8, 783992) Mr. Gandhi, in an interview with an American news agency, makes a candid and significant admission.
('80', 491, 5, 9, 784092) When asked how many of his followers who are now in jail sincerely subscribe to his own belief that violence can never be right, he replies: “I do not mind it being said that the majority are non violent only out of policy.
('80', 491, 5, 10, 784316) That is the weakest part of my campaign.
('80', 491, 5, 11, 784357) .” Impartial observers of Mr. Gandhi’s civil disobedience campaign have suspected as much from the beginning, and their suspicion has been confirmed of late by the departure from Mr. Gandhi’s ranks of men like Mr. Munshi and Dr. Satyapal 2. Mr. Gandhi himself has now publicly recognized, and for the first time, that the non violent slogan is being exploited politically.
('80', 491, 5, 12, 784730) He also admits by implication that such exploitation is distasteful to him, and, indeed, weakens his campaign.
('80', 491, 5, 13, 784841) When the campaign was first launched, it was widely believed that only those who were in full agreement with Mr. Gandhi’s interpretation of non violence should offer themselves for jail.
('80', 491, 5, 14, 785028) And yet, as we now know, a majority submitted their names, not out of conviction, but “only out of policy”—some of them through a sense of loyalty to the party organization, others from more questionable motives.
('80', 491, 5, 15, 785241) Nor can Mr. Gandhi escape the largest share of the blame for allowing this inconsistency to develop.
('80', 491, 5, 16, 785342) He is personally responsible for sanctioning the names of satyagrahis, and it is reasonable to suppose that in some instances at least he accepted nominees who he knew did not fulfil the conditions which he himself had laid down.
('80', 491, 5, 17, 785572) If the presence in jail of those who went “only out of policy” has weakened Mr. Gandhi’s campaign, then Mr. Gandhi has proved that he is among his own worst enemies.
('80', 491, 5, 18, 785738) Either he has been lax in interpreting his own rules of satyagraha or he has been deceived by the majority of those whose names were submitted.
('80', 491, 5, 19, 785882) Mr. Gandhi can best say which of these alternatives is the right one.
