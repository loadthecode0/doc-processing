('16', 0, 1, 2, 44) 1. INDIAN COLONIAL EMIGRATION
('16', 0, 2, 3, 74) I have carefully read the resolution issued at Simla by the Government of India on the 1st instant, embodying the report of the Inter Departmental Conference recently held in London.
('16', 0, 2, 4, 257) 1 It will be remembered that this was the conference referred to in the Viceregal speech of last year at the opening of the Sessions of the Viceregal Legislative Council.
('16', 0, 2, 5, 428) It will be remembered, too, that this was the conference which Sir James Meston and Sir S. P. Sinha were to have attended but were unable to attend owing to their having returned to India before the date of the meeting of the conference.
('16', 0, 2, 6, 666) 2 It is stated in the report under discussion that these gentlemen were to discuss the question of emigration to certain English colonies informally with the two Secretaries of State, i.e., the Secretary of State for India and the Secretary of State for the Colonies.
('16', 0, 2, 7, 934) Lord Islington 3, Sir A. Steel Maitland 4 and Messrs Seton 5, Crindle 6, Green 7 and Macnaughton 8 constituted the Conference.
('16', 0, 2, 8, 1061) To take the wording of the Resolution, this Conference sat “to consider the proposals for a new assisted system of emigration to British Guiana, Trinidad, Jamaica and Fiji”.
('16', 0, 2, 9, 1235) The public should therefore note that this assisted emigration is to be confined only to the four Crown Colonies mentioned and not to the self governing Colonies of South Africa, Canada or Australia, or the Crown Colony of Mauritius.
('16', 0, 2, 10, 1469) 9 What follows will show the importance of this distinction.
('16', 0, 2, 11, 1530) It is something to be thankful for, that “the Government of India have not yet considered the report and reserved judgement on all the points raised in it”.
('16', 0, 2, 12, 1687) This is as it should be on a matter so serious as this and one which only last year fairly
('16', 0, 3, 13, 1778) 1 In May 1917 to discuss a new system of emigration 2 Sir James Meston and S. P. Sinha represented India at the Imperial War Conference held in April, 1917. They were also nominated by the Government of India as its representatives to the Inter Departmental Conference, but both of them had to return to India before the Conference could meet formally.

('16', 1, 0, 1, 2290) 2 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 1, 1, 2, 2330) convulsed the whole of India and which has in one shape or another agitated the country since 1895. The declaration too that “His Majesty’s Government in agreement with the Government of India have decided that indentured emigration shall not be re opened” is welcome as is also the one that “no free emigrants 1 can be introduced into any colony until all Indian emigrants already there have been released from existing indentures”.
('16', 1, 1, 3, 2764) In spite however of so much in the report that fills one with gladness, the substantive part of it which sets forth the scheme which is to replace indentured emigration is so far as one can judge, to say the least of it, disappointing.
('16', 1, 1, 4, 3000) Stripped of all the phraseology under which the scheme has been veiled, it is nothing less than a system of indentured emigration no doubt on a more humane basis and safeguarded with some conditions beneficial to the emigrants taking advantage of it.
('16', 1, 1, 5, 3251) The main point that should be borne in mind is that the conference sat designedly to consider a scheme of emigration not in the interests of the Indian labourer but in those of the Colonial employer.
('16', 1, 1, 6, 3451) The new system therefore is devised to help the colonies concerned.
('16', 1, 1, 7, 3519) India needs no outlet at any rate for the present moment for emigration outside the country.
('16', 1, 1, 8, 3612) It is debatable whether in any event the four colonies will be the most suitable for Indian colonisation.
('16', 1, 1, 9, 3718) The best thing therefore that can happen from an Indian stand point is that there should be no assisted emigration from India of any type whatsoever.
('16', 1, 1, 10, 3868) In the absence of any such assistance, emigration will have to be entirely free and at the risk and expense of the emigrant himself.
('16', 1, 1, 11, 4001) Past experience shows that, in that event, there will be very little voluntary emigration to distant colonies.
('16', 1, 1, 12, 4112) In the report, assisted emigration means, to use a mild expression, stimulated emigration; and surely with the industries of India crying out for labour and with her legitimate resources yet undeveloped, it is madness to think of providing a stimulus for the stay at home Indian to go out of India.
('16', 1, 1, 13, 4411) Neither the Government nor any voluntary agency has been found capable of protecting from ill usage the Indian who emigrates either to Burma or Ceylon, much less can any such protection avail in far off Fiji or then three other colonies.
('16', 1, 1, 14, 4649) I hope that
('16', 1, 2, 15, 4661) 1 “emigration” in the report published in The Indian Review, September 1917
('16', 2, 0, 1, 4737) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 3
('16', 2, 1, 2, 4781) leaders of public opinion in India will therefore take their stand on the one impregnable rock of not wanting any emigration whatsoever to the colonies.
('16', 2, 1, 3, 4934) It might be argued that we, as a component part of the Empire, are bound to consider the wants of our partners, but this would not be a fair plea to advance so long as India stands in need of all the labour she can produce.
('16', 2, 1, 4, 5158) If, therefore, India does not assist the colonies, it is not because of want of will, but it is due to want of ability.
('16', 2, 1, 5, 5278) An additional reason a politician would be justified in using is that, so long as India does not in reality occupy the position of an equal partner with the colonies and so long as her sons continue to be regarded by Englishmen in the colonies and English employers even nearer home to be fit only as hewers of wood and drawers of water, no scheme of emigration to the colonies can be morally advantageous to Indian emigrants.
('16', 2, 1, 6, 5705) If the badge of inferiority is always to be worn by them, they can never rise to their full status and any material advantage they will gain by emigrating can therefore be of no consideration.
('16', 2, 1, 7, 5898) But let us for the moment consider the new system.
('16', 2, 2, 8, 5949) The system to be followed in future will be one of aided emigration 1 and its object will be to encourage the settlement of Indians in certain colonies after a probationary period of employment in those colonies to train and fit them for life and work there and at the same time to acquire 2 a supply of the labour essential to the well being of the colonists 3 themselves.
('16', 2, 2, 9, 6323) So the re settlement is to be conditional on previous employment under contract and it will be seen in the course of our examination that this contract is to be just as binding as the contracts used to be under indenture.
('16', 2, 2, 10, 6545) The report has the following humorous passage in it:
('16', 2, 3, 11, 6598) He will be in no way restricted to service under any particular employer except that for his own protection a selected employer will be chosen for him for the first six months.
('16', 2, 3, 12, 6775) This has a flavour of the old indentured system.
('16', 2, 3, 13, 6824) One of the evils complained of about that system was that the labourer was assigned to an employer.
('16', 2, 3, 14, 6924) He was not free to choose one himself.
('16', 2, 3, 15, 6963) Under the new system, the employer is to be selected for the protection of the

('16', 3, 1, 2, 7209) labourer.
('16', 3, 1, 3, 7219) It is hardly necessary for me to point out that the would be labourer will never be able to feel the protection devised for him.
('16', 3, 1, 4, 7348) The labourer is further
('16', 3, 2, 5, 7372) to be encouraged to work for his first three years in agricultural industries by the offer, should he do so, of numerous and important benefits subsequently as a colonist.
('16', 3, 2, 6, 7544) This is another inducement to indenture and I know enough of such schemes to be able to assure both the Government and the public that these so called inducements in the hands of clever manipulators become nothing short of methods of compulsion in respect of innocent and ignorant Indian labourers.
('16', 3, 2, 7, 7843) It is due to the framers of the scheme that I should draw attention to the fact that they have avoided all criminal penalties for breach of contract.
('16', 3, 2, 8, 7993) In India itself if the scheme is adopted, we are promised a revival of the much dreaded depots and emigration agents, all no doubt on a more respectable basis, but still of the same type and capable of untold mischief.
('16', 3, 2, 9, 8212) The rest of the report is not likely to interest the public, but those who wish to study it will, I doubt not, come to the conclusion to which I have been driven, that the framers have done their best to strip the old system of many of the abuses which had crept into it, but they have not succeeded in placing before the Indian public an acceptable scheme.
('16', 3, 2, 10, 8570) I hold that it was an impossible task.
('16', 3, 2, 11, 8609) The system of indenture was one of temporary slavery; it was incapable of being amended, it should only be ended and it is to be hoped that India will never consent to its revival in any shape or form.

('16', 4, 1, 3, 9354) That is her wish and I think so too.
('16', 4, 1, 4, 9391) Mrs. Petit cares for her wonderfully well but Mrs. Polak thinks that, if she is to be laid up for a long time, it should not be at her place.
('16', 4, 1, 5, 9533) It will not be surprising, therefore, if I have to stay on for two or three days more, or even longer.
('16', 4, 1, 6, 9636) I shall send you a wire.
('16', 4, 1, 7, 9661) Mr. Polak left yesterday.
('16', 4, 1, 8, 9687) Matters are proceeding satisfactorily about satyagraha.
('16', 4, 1, 9, 9743) There is a meeting today at which I have some hope that an agreed resolution will be passed.
('16', 4, 2, 10, 9836) Amritlalbhai 2 has fallen ill.
('16', 4, 2, 11, 9867) That is the reason why he is late.
('16', 4, 2, 12, 9902) He is somewhat better now and will be ready with the plan for our building in eight or ten days perhaps.
('16', 4, 2, 13, 10007) I hope everyone is all right there.
('16', 4, 2, 14, 10043) Thakorelal is to be paid Rs. 15 every month.
('16', 4, 2, 15, 10088) I have spoken to Fulchand.
('16', 4, 2, 16, 10115) Resume forwarding the post [to me here].
('16', 4, 2, 17, 10156) You have to send for Mavji’s brother yarn worth Rs. 30 for socks at the place that he will indicate.
('16', 4, 2, 18, 10257) Inquire of him and make the necessary arrangement.
('16', 4, 2, 19, 10308) Mangaldas Sheth has promised to supply all our requirements of yarn at two annas less than the market rate.

('16', 4, 7, 26, 10718) September 2, 1917
('16', 4, 8, 27, 10736) A heated discussion took place.
('16', 4, 8, 28, 10768) M. K. Gandhi, on being asked, stated that the campaign of passive resistance could not be carried on by an institution like the Congress.
('16', 4, 8, 29, 10906) Passive resistance could be described merely as a matter of conscience or force of soul, when it was useless to go to lawyers.
('16', 4, 9, 30, 11033) 1 The meeting was adjourned due to differences over the resolution and only an agreed amendment passed; Vide the following item.

('16', 5, 1, 2, 11221) After Gandhi had delivered his opinion, it was suggested that B. G. Tilak should, after consultation with Gandhi, suggest to the meeting some acceptable amendment.
('16', 5, 1, 3, 11385) On this Gandhi himself suggested an amendment but Tilak insisted on making his own alterations in it before placing it before the meeting.
('16', 5, 1, 4, 11524) The President, after some discussion with Tilak and his party, declared that a certain amendment had been drawn up in agreement with Tilak and his party.
('16', 5, 1, 5, 11678) The amendment was as follows:
('16', 5, 2, 6, 11708) ‘Though the Bombay Provincial Congress Committee is of opinion that there is a strong feeling among the people to support the campaign of passive resistance on account of the coercive measures recently taken by the Government, it advises that, taking into consideration the fact that Mr. Montagu 1 is coming on a visit to this country and that the reasons of his coming are well known, the work of the consideration of and giving opinion on the principles underlying passive resistance and the measures necessary to put them into effect, which has been entrusted to this committee by the All India Congress Committee and the Council of the All India Muslim League, be for the present held in abeyance, and the meeting expresses the hope that the Government will take the necessary steps to allay the bitter feeling aroused among the people by action of internments and coercive measures taken by the authorities.
('16', 5, 2, 7, 12621) This course will enable the Secretary of state to fulfil the work entrusted to him under normal conditions.’
('16', 5, 3, 8, 12730) it was unanimously passed amidst cheers.

('16', 5, 6, 11, 12858) [September 2, 1917] 2
('16', 5, 7, 12, 12880) BHAISHRI SHANKARLAL, You want to know my ideas about satyagraha.
('16', 5, 7, 13, 12945) Here they are in brief: The English phrase “passive resistance” does not suggest the power I wish to write about; “satyagraha” is the right word.
('16', 5, 7, 14, 13091) Satyagraha is soul force, as opposed to armed strength.
('16', 5, 7, 15, 13147) Since it is essentially an ethical weapon, only men inclined to the ethical way of life can use it wisely.
('16', 5, 7, 16, 13254) Prahlad, Mirabai, and others were satyagrahis.
('16', 5, 8, 17, 13301) 1 E. S. Montagu (1879 1924), Secretary of State for India, 1917 22 and cosponsor of the Montagu Chelmsford Reforms 2 Published in Gujarati, 2 9 1917

('16', 6, 1, 2, 13494) the time of the Morocco fighting, the Arabs were under fire from French guns.
('16', 6, 1, 3, 13572) The Arabs were fighting, as they believed, solely for their religion.
('16', 6, 1, 4, 13642) Reckless of their lives, they advanced running towards the French guns with cries of “Ya Allah” 1. Here, there was no scope at all for fighting back to kill.
('16', 6, 1, 5, 13800) The French gunners refused to fire on these Arabs and, throwing up their caps, ran to embrace these brave Arabs with shouts of joy.
('16', 6, 1, 6, 13932) This is an example of satyagraha and the success it can achieve.
('16', 6, 1, 7, 13997) The Arabs were not satyagrahis by deliberate choice.
('16', 6, 1, 8, 14050) They got ready to face death under pressure of a strong impulse, and had no love in their hearts.
('16', 6, 1, 9, 14148) A satyagrahi bears no ill will, does not lay down his life in anger, but refuses rather to submit to his “enemy” or oppressor because he has the strength himself to suffer.
('16', 6, 1, 10, 14321) He should, therefore, have a courageous spirit and a forgiving and compassionate nature.
('16', 6, 1, 11, 14410) Imam Hassan 2 and Hussain 3 were merely two boys.
('16', 6, 1, 12, 14460) They felt that an injustice had been done to them.
('16', 6, 1, 13, 14511) When called upon to surrender, they refused.
('16', 6, 1, 14, 14556) They knew at the time that this would mean death for them.
('16', 6, 1, 15, 14615) If, however, they were to submit to injustices they would disgrace their manhood and betray their religion.
('16', 6, 1, 16, 14723) In these circumstances, they yielded to the embrace of death.
('16', 6, 1, 17, 14785) The heads of these fine young men rolled on the battlefield.
('16', 6, 1, 18, 14846) In my view, Islam did not attain its greatness by the power of the sword but entirely through the self immolation of its fakirs.
('16', 6, 1, 19, 14975) It is soldierlike to allow oneself to be cut down by a sword, not to use the sword on another.
('16', 6, 1, 20, 15070) When he comes to realize that he is guilty of murder, the killer, if he has been in the wrong, will feel sorry forever afterwards.
('16', 6, 1, 21, 15201) The victim, however, will have gained nothing but victory even if he had acted wrongly in courting death.
('16', 6, 1, 22, 15307) Satyagraha is the way of non violence.
('16', 6, 1, 23, 15346) It is, therefore, justified, indeed it is the right course, at all times and all places.
('16', 6, 1, 24, 15435) The power of arms is violence and condemned as such in all religions.
('16', 6, 1, 25, 15505) Even those who advocate the use of arms put various limits on it.
('16', 6, 1, 26, 15571) There are no limits on satyagraha, or rather, none except those placed by the satyagrahi’s capacity for tapascharya, for voluntary suffering.
('16', 6, 1, 27, 15713) Obviously, it is irrelevant to raise issues about the legality of such satyagraha.
('16', 6, 1, 28, 15796) It is for the satyagrahi to decide.
('16', 6, 1, 29, 15832) Observers may
('16', 6, 2, 30, 15846) 1 Glory to God 2 Sons of Ali by his wife Fatima, daughter of the prophet.
('16', 6, 2, 31, 15920) They refused to acknowledge the authority of Yazid (Caliph, 680 3).
('16', 6, 2, 32, 15988) Hussain revolted against him, but was defeated and killed at Karbala.
('16', 7, 0, 1, 16058) 8 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 7, 1, 2, 16098) judge satyagraha after the event.
('16', 7, 1, 3, 16132) The world’s displeasure will not deter a satyagrahi.
('16', 7, 1, 4, 16185) Whether or not satyagraha should be started is not decided by any mathematical rule.
('16', 7, 1, 5, 16270) A man who believes that satyagraha may be started only after weighing the chances of defeat and victory and assuring oneself of the certainty of victory, may be a shrewd enough politician or an intelligent man, but he is no satyagrahi.
('16', 7, 1, 6, 16506) A satyagrahi acts spontaneously.
('16', 7, 1, 7, 16539) Satyagraha and arms have both been in use from time im memorial.
('16', 7, 1, 8, 16604) We find them praised in the extant scriptures.
('16', 7, 1, 9, 16651) They are the expressions, one of the daivi sampad 1 and the other of the asuri sampad 1. We believe that in former times in India the daivi sampad was much the stronger of the two.
('16', 7, 1, 10, 16832) Even today that is the ideal we cherish.
('16', 7, 1, 11, 16873) Europe provides the most striking example of the predominance of the asuri sampad.
('16', 7, 1, 12, 16956) Both these forms of strength are preferable to weakness, to what we know by the rather plain but much apter word ‘cowardice’.
('16', 7, 1, 13, 17082) Without either, swaraj or genuine popular awakening is impossible.
('16', 7, 1, 14, 17149) Swaraj achieved otherwise than through resort to one or the other will not be true swaraj.
('16', 7, 1, 15, 17240) Such swaraj can have no effect on the people.
('16', 7, 1, 16, 17286) Popular awakening cannot be brought about without strength, without manliness.
('16', 7, 1, 17, 17365) Let the leaders say what they like and the Government strive its utmost, unless they and we, all of us, strengthen the forces of satyagraha, the methods of violence are bound automatically to gain ascendancy.
('16', 7, 1, 18, 17574) They are like weeds which grow wild in any soil.
('16', 7, 1, 19, 17623) The crop of satyagraha requires willingness to exert oneself or a venturesome spirit by way of manure.
('16', 7, 1, 20, 17726) Just as, moreover, the seedlings are likely to be lost among the weeds if the latter are not plucked out, so also will weeds of violence keep growing unless we keep the land free of them by tapascharya and, with compassion, pluck out those which have already grown.
('16', 7, 1, 21, 17992) We can, with the help of satyagraha, win over those young men who have been driven to desperation and anger by what they think to be the tyranny of the Government and utilize their courage and their mettlesome spirit, their capacity for suffering, to strengthen the daivi sampad of satyagraha.
('16', 7, 1, 22, 18286) It is therefore very much to be desired that satyagraha is propagated as quickly as can be.
('16', 7, 1, 23, 18378) This is in the interest both of the rulers and the ruled.
('16', 7, 1, 24, 18436) The satyagrahi desires to harass neither the Government nor anyone else.
('16', 7, 1, 25, 18509) He takes no step without the fullest deliberation.
('16', 7, 1, 26, 18560) He is never arrogant.
('16', 7, 2, 27, 18582) 1 God like equipment and demoniac equipment (Vide Bhagvad Gita, XVI.
('16', 8, 0, 1, 18651) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 9
('16', 8, 1, 2, 18695) Consequently, he will keep away from ‘boycott’ but be always firm in the vow of swadeshi as a matter of duty.
('16', 8, 1, 3, 18805) He fears God alone, so that no other power can intimidate him.
('16', 8, 1, 4, 18868) He will never, out of fear of punishment, leave a duty undone.
('16', 8, 1, 5, 18931) I need hardly say now that it is our duty to resort to satyagraha to secure the release of the learned Annie Bai and her co workers.
('16', 8, 1, 6, 19064) Whether we approve of every or any action of hers is another question.
('16', 8, 1, 7, 19135) I, for one, certainly do not approve of some of them; all the same, her incarceration by the Government is a great mistake and an act of injustice.
('16', 8, 1, 8, 19283) I know, of course, that the Government does not think it a mistake.
('16', 8, 1, 9, 19351) Maybe the people are wrong in desiring her release.
('16', 8, 1, 10, 19403) The Government has acted according to its lights.
('16', 8, 1, 11, 19453) What can the people do to express their outraged feelings?
('16', 8, 1, 12, 19512) Petitions, etc., are good enough when one’s suffering is bearable.
('16', 8, 1, 13, 19579) When it is unbearable, there is no remedy but satyagraha.
('16', 8, 1, 14, 19637) Only when people find it unbearable will they, and only those who find it unbearable will, devote their all, body, mind and possessions, to securing the release of Annie Bai.
('16', 8, 1, 15, 19812) This will be a powerful expression of popular feeling.
('16', 8, 1, 16, 19867) It is my unshakable faith that before so great a self sacrifice even the power of an emperor will give way.
('16', 8, 1, 17, 19975) People may certainly restrain their feelings in view of the forthcoming visit of Mr. Montagu.
('16', 8, 1, 18, 20069) That will be an expression of faith in his sense of justice.
('16', 8, 1, 19, 20130) If she is not released, however, before his arrival, it will be our duty to resort to satyagraha.
('16', 8, 1, 20, 20228) We do not want to provoke the Government or put difficulties in its way.
('16', 8, 1, 21, 20301) By resorting to satyagraha, we reveal the intensity of our injured feelings and thereby serve the Government.

('16', 8, 3, 23, 20481) 5. SATYAGRAHA—NOT PASSIVE RESISTANCE 1
('16', 8, 4, 24, 20520) [About September 2, 1917] 2
('16', 8, 5, 25, 20548) The force denoted by the term ‘passive resistance’ and translated into Hindi as nishkriya pratirodha is not very accurately described either by the original English phrase or by its Hindi rendering.
('16', 8, 5, 26, 20747) Its correct description is ‘satyagraha’.
('16', 8, 5, 27, 20788) Satyagraha was born in South Africa in 1908. There was no word in any Indian language
('16', 8, 6, 28, 20874) 1 The original Gujarati is not available.
('16', 8, 6, 29, 20916) 2 This article appears to belong to the same date as the preceding item.
('16', 9, 0, 1, 20989) 10 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 9, 1, 2, 21030) denoting the power which our countrymen in South Africa invoked for the redress of their grievances.
('16', 9, 1, 3, 21131) There was an English equivalent, namely, ‘passive resistance’, and we carried on with it.
('16', 9, 1, 4, 21221) However, the need for a word to describe this unique power came to be increasingly felt, and it was decided to award a prize to anyone who could think of an appropriate term.
('16', 9, 1, 5, 21396) A Gujarati speaking 1 gentleman submitted the word ‘satyagraha’, and it was adjudged the best.
('16', 9, 2, 6, 21491) ‘Passive resistance’ conveyed the idea of the Suffragette Movement in England.
('16', 9, 2, 7, 21570) Burning of houses by these women was called ‘passive resistance’ and so also their fasting in prison.
('16', 9, 2, 8, 21672) All such acts might very well be ‘passive resistance’ but they were not ‘satyagraha’.
('16', 9, 2, 9, 21758) It is said of ‘passive resistance’ that it is the weapon of the weak, but the power which is the subject of this article can be used only by the strong.
('16', 9, 2, 10, 21911) This power is not ‘passive’ resistance; indeed it calls for intense activity.
('16', 9, 2, 11, 21989) The movement in South Africa was not passive but active.
('16', 9, 2, 12, 22046) The Indians of South Africa believed that Truth was their object, that Truth ever triumphs, and with this definiteness of purpose they persistently held on to Truth.
('16', 9, 2, 13, 22212) They put up with all the suffering that this persistence implied.
('16', 9, 2, 14, 22278) With the conviction that Truth is not to be renounced even unto death, they shed the fear of death.
('16', 9, 2, 15, 22378) In the cause of Truth, the prison was a palace to them and its doors the gateway to freedom.
('16', 9, 3, 16, 22471) WHAT IS SATYAGRAHA?
('16', 9, 4, 17, 22491) Satyagraha is not physical force.
('16', 9, 4, 18, 22525) A satyagrahi does not inflict pain on the adversary; he does not seek his destruction.
('16', 9, 4, 19, 22612) A satyagrahi never resorts to firearms.
('16', 9, 4, 20, 22652) In the use of satyagraha, there is no ill will whatever.
('16', 9, 4, 21, 22709) Satyagraha is pure soul force.
('16', 9, 4, 22, 22740) Truth is the very substance of the soul.
('16', 9, 4, 23, 22781) That is why this force is called satyagraha.
('16', 9, 4, 24, 22826) The soul is informed with knowledge.
('16', 9, 4, 25, 22863) In it burns the flame of love.
('16', 9, 4, 26, 22894) If someone gives us pain through ignorance, we shall win him through love.
('16', 9, 4, 27, 22969) “Nonviolence is the supreme dharma” 2 is the proof of this power of love.
('16', 9, 4, 28, 23043) Non violence is a dormant state.
('16', 9, 4, 29, 23076) In the waking state, it is love.
('16', 9, 4, 30, 23109) Ruled by love, the world goes on.
('16', 9, 4, 31, 23143) In English there is a saying, “Might is Right”.
('16', 9, 4, 32, 23191) Then there is the doctrine of the survival of the fittest.
('16', 9, 4, 33, 23250) Both these ideas are contradictory to the above principle.
('16', 9, 4, 34, 23309) Neither is wholly

('16', 10, 1, 2, 23431) If ill will were the chief motive force, the world would have been destroyed long ago; and neither would I have had the opportunity to write this article nor would the hopes of the readers be fulfilled.
('16', 10, 1, 3, 23634) We are alive solely because of love.
('16', 10, 1, 4, 23671) We are all ourselves the proof of this.
('16', 10, 1, 5, 23711) Deluded by modern western civilization, we have forgotten our ancient civilization and worship the might of arms.
('16', 10, 2, 6, 23825) WORSHIP OF ARMED MIGHT We forget the principle of non violence, which is the essence of all religions.
('16', 10, 2, 7, 23928) The doctrine of arms stands for irreligion.
('16', 10, 2, 8, 23972) It is due to the sway of that doctrine that a sanguinary war is raging in Europe.
('16', 10, 2, 9, 24054) In India also we find worship of arms.
('16', 10, 2, 10, 24093) We see it even in that great work of Tulsidas.
('16', 10, 2, 11, 24140) But it is seen in all the books that soul force is the supreme power.
('16', 10, 3, 12, 24210) RAMA AND RAVANA Rama stands for the soul and Ravana for the non soul.
('16', 10, 3, 13, 24280) The immense physical might of Ravana is as nothing compared to the soul force of Rama.
('16', 10, 3, 14, 24367) Ravana’s ten heads are as straw to Rama.
('16', 10, 3, 15, 24408) Rama is a yogi, he has conquered self and pride.
('16', 10, 3, 16, 24457) He is “placid equally in affluence and adversity”, he has “neither attachment, nor greed nor the intoxication of status”.
('16', 10, 3, 17, 24579) This represents the ultimate in satyagraha.
('16', 10, 3, 18, 24623) The banner of saytagraha can again fly in the Indian sky and it is our duty to raise it.
('16', 10, 3, 19, 24712) If we take recourse to satyagraha, we can conquer our conquerors the English, make them bow before our tremendous soul force, and the issue will be of benefit to the whole world.
('16', 10, 3, 20, 24891) It is certain that India cannot rival Britain or Europe in force of arms.
('16', 10, 3, 21, 24965) The British worship the war god and they can all of them become, as they are becoming, bearers of arms.
('16', 10, 3, 22, 25069) The hundreds of millions in India can never carry arms.
('16', 10, 3, 23, 25125) They have made the religion of non violence their own.
('16', 10, 3, 24, 25180) It is impossible for the varnashram system to disappear from India.
('16', 10, 4, 25, 25248) WAY OF VARNASHRAM The way of varnashram is a necessary law of nature.
('16', 10, 4, 26, 25318) India, by making a judicious use of it, derives much benefit.
('16', 10, 4, 27, 25380) Even the Muslims and the English in India observe this system to some extent.
('16', 10, 4, 28, 25458) Outside of India, too, people follow it without being aware of it.
('16', 10, 4, 29, 25525) So long as this institution of varnashram exists in India, everyone cannot bear arms here.
('16', 10, 4, 30, 25616) The highest place in India is assigned to the brahmana dharma—which is soul force.
('16', 10, 4, 31, 25699) Even the armed warrior does obeisance to the brahmin.
('16', 10, 4, 32, 25753) So long as this custom prevails, it is vain for us to aspire for equality with the West in force of arms.
('16', 11, 0, 1, 25859) 12 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 11, 1, 2, 25900) PANACEA FOR ALL ILLS It is our kamadhenu 1. It brings good both to the satyagrahi and his adversary.
('16', 11, 1, 3, 26001) It is ever victorious.
('16', 11, 1, 4, 26024) For instance, Harishchandra was a satyagrahi, Prahlad was a satyagrahi, Mirabai was a satyagrahi.
('16', 11, 1, 5, 26122) Daniel, Socrates and those Arabs who hurled themselves on the fire of the French artillery were all satyagrahis.
('16', 11, 1, 6, 26235) We see from these examples that a satyagrahi does not fear for his body, he does not give up what he thinks is Truth; the word ‘defeat’ is not to be found in his dictionary, he does not wish for the destruction of his antagonist, he does not vent anger on him; but has only compassion for him.
('16', 11, 2, 7, 26529) A satyagrahi does not wait for others, but throws himself into the fray, relying entirely on his own resources.
('16', 11, 2, 8, 26641) He trusts that when the time comes, others will do likewise.
('16', 11, 2, 9, 26702) His practice is his precept.
('16', 11, 2, 10, 26731) Like air, satyagraha is all pervading.
('16', 11, 2, 11, 26770) It is infectious, which means that all people—big and small, men and women—can become satyagrahis.
('16', 11, 2, 12, 26869) No one is kept out from the army of satyagrahis.
('16', 11, 2, 13, 26918) A satyagrahi cannot perpetrate tyranny on anyone; he is not subdued through application of physical force; he does not strike at anyone.
('16', 11, 2, 14, 27055) Just as anyone can resort to satyagraha, it can be resorted to in almost any situation.
('16', 11, 3, 15, 27143) HISTORICAL EVIDENCE
('16', 11, 4, 16, 27163) People demand historical evidence in support of satyagraha.
('16', 11, 4, 17, 27223) History is for the most part a record of armed activities.
('16', 11, 4, 18, 27282) Natural activities find very little mention in it.
('16', 11, 4, 19, 27333) Only uncommon activities strike us with wonder.
('16', 11, 4, 20, 27381) Satyagraha has been used always and in all situations.
('16', 11, 4, 21, 27436) The father and the son, the man and the wife are perpetually resorting to satyagraha, one towards the other.
('16', 11, 4, 22, 27545) When a father gets angry and punishes the son, the son does not hit back with a weapon, he conquers his father’s anger by submitting to him.
('16', 11, 4, 23, 27686) The son refuses to be subdued by the unjust rule of his father but he puts up with the punishment that he may incur through disobeying the unjust father.
('16', 11, 4, 24, 27840) We can similarly free ourselves of the unjust rule of the Government by defying the unjust rule and accepting the punishments that go with it.
('16', 11, 4, 25, 27983) We do not bear malice towards the Government.
('16', 11, 4, 26, 28029) When we set its fears at rest, when we do not desire to make armed assaults on the administrators, nor to unseat them from power, but only to get rid of their injustice, they will at once be subdued to our will.
('16', 11, 5, 27, 28241) 1 Mythical cow which yielded whatever one wished
('16', 12, 0, 1, 28290) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 13
('16', 12, 1, 2, 28335) The question is asked why we should call any rule unjust.
('16', 12, 1, 3, 28393) In saying so, we ourselves assume the function of a judge.
('16', 12, 1, 4, 28452) It is true.
('16', 12, 1, 5, 28464) But in this world, we always have to act as judges for ourselves.
('16', 12, 1, 6, 28530) That is why the satyagrahi does not strike his adversary with arms.
('16', 12, 1, 7, 28598) If he has Truth on his side, he will win, and if his thought is faulty, he will suffer the consequences of his fault.
('16', 12, 2, 8, 28716) What is the good, they ask, of only one person opposing injustice; for he will be punished and destroyed, he will languish in prison or meet an untimely end through hanging.
('16', 12, 2, 9, 28890) The objection is not valid.
('16', 12, 2, 10, 28918) History shows that all reforms have begun with one person.
('16', 12, 2, 11, 28977) Fruit is hard to come by without tapasya.
('16', 12, 2, 12, 29019) The suffering that has to be undergone in satyagraha is tapasya in its purest form.
('16', 12, 2, 13, 29103) Only when the tapasya is capable of bearing fruit, do we have the fruit.
('16', 12, 2, 14, 29176) This establishes the fact that when there is insufficient tapasya, the fruit is delayed.
('16', 12, 2, 15, 29265) The tapasya of Jesus Christ, boundless though it was, was not sufficient for Europe’s need.
('16', 12, 2, 16, 29357) Europe has disapproved Christ.
('16', 12, 2, 17, 29388) Through ignorance, it has disregarded Christ’s pure way of life.
('16', 12, 2, 18, 29453) Many Christs will have to offer themselves as sacrifice at the terrible altar of Europe, and only then will realization dawn on that continent.
('16', 12, 2, 19, 29597) But Jesus will always be the first among these.
('16', 12, 2, 20, 29645) He has been the sower of the seed and his will therefore be the credit for raising the harvest.
('16', 12, 3, 21, 29741) EDUCATING IGNORANT PEASANTS IN SATYAGRAHA
('16', 12, 4, 22, 29783) It is said that it is a very difficult, if not an altogether impossible, task to educate ignorant peasants in satyagraha and that it is full of perils, for it is a very arduous business to transform unlettered ignorant people from one condition into another.
('16', 12, 4, 23, 30042) Both the arguments are just silly.
('16', 12, 4, 24, 30077) The people of India are perfectly fit to receive the training of satyagraha.
('16', 12, 4, 25, 30154) India has knowledge of dharma, and where there is knowledge of dharma, satyagraha is a very simple matter.
('16', 12, 4, 26, 30261) The people of India have drunk of the nectar of devotion.
('16', 12, 4, 27, 30319) This great people overflows with faith.
('16', 12, 4, 28, 30359) It is no difficult matter to lead such a people on to the right path of satyagraha.
('16', 12, 4, 29, 30443) Some have a fear that once people get involved in satyagraha, they may at a later stage take to arms.
('16', 12, 4, 30, 30545) This fear is illusory.
('16', 12, 4, 31, 30568) From the path of satyagraha [clinging to Truth], a transition to the path of a satyagraha [clinging to untruth] is impossible.
('16', 12, 4, 32, 30695) It is possible of course that some people who believe in armed activity may mislead the satyagrahis by infiltrating into their ranks and later making them take to arms.
('16', 12, 4, 33, 30864) This is possible in all enterprises.
('16', 12, 4, 34, 30901) But as compared to other activities, it is less likely to
('16', 13, 0, 1, 30959) 14 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 13, 1, 2, 31000) happen in satyagraha, for their motives soon get exposed and when the people are not ready to take up arms, it becomes almost impossible to lead them on to that terrible path.
('16', 13, 1, 3, 31176) The might of arms is directly opposed to the might of satyagraha.
('16', 13, 1, 4, 31242) Just as darkness does not abide in light, soulless armed activity cannot enter the sunlike radiance of soul force.
('16', 13, 1, 5, 31357) Many Pathans took part in satyagraha in South Africa abiding by all the rules of satyagraha.
('16', 13, 2, 6, 31450) Then it is said that much suffering is involved in being a sat yagrahi and that the entire people will not be willing to put upwith this suffering.
('16', 13, 2, 7, 31598) The objection is not valid.
('16', 13, 2, 8, 31626) People in general always follow in the footsteps of the noble.
('16', 13, 2, 9, 31689) There is no doubt that it is difficult to produce a satyagrahi leader.
('16', 13, 2, 10, 31760) Our experience is that a satyagrahi needs many more virtues like self control, fearlessness, etc., than are requisite for one who believes in armed action.
('16', 13, 2, 11, 31916) The greatness of the man bearing arms does not lie in the superiority of the arms, nor does it lie in his physical prowess.
('16', 13, 2, 12, 32040) It lies in his determination and fearlessness in face of death.
('16', 13, 2, 13, 32104) General Gordon was a mighty warrior of the British Empire.
('16', 13, 2, 14, 32163) In the statue that has been erected in his memory he has only a small baton in his hand.
('16', 13, 2, 15, 32252) It goes to show that the strength of a warrior is not measured by reference to his weapons but by his firmness of mind.
('16', 13, 2, 16, 32372) A satyagrahi needs millions of times more of such firmness than does a bearer of arms.
('16', 13, 2, 17, 32459) The birth of such a man can bring about the salvation of India in no time.
('16', 13, 2, 18, 32534) Not only India but the whole world awaits the advent of such a man.
('16', 13, 2, 19, 32602) We may in the meanwhile prepare the ground as much as we can through satyagraha.
('16', 13, 3, 20, 32683) USE OF SATYAGRAHA
('16', 13, 4, 21, 32701) How can we make use of satyagraha in the present conditions?
('16', 13, 4, 22, 32762) Why should we take to satyagraha in the fight for freedom?
('16', 13, 4, 23, 32821) We are all guilty of killing manliness.
('16', 13, 4, 24, 32861) So long as our learned Annie Besant is in detention, it is an insult to our manhood.
('16', 13, 4, 25, 32946) How can we secure her release through satyagraha?
('16', 13, 4, 26, 32996) It may be that the Government has acted in good faith, that it has sufficient grounds for keeping her under detention.
('16', 13, 4, 27, 33115) But, at any rate, the people are unhappy at her being deprived of her freedom.
('16', 13, 4, 28, 33194) Annie Besant cannot be freed through armed action.
('16', 13, 4, 29, 33245) No Indian will approve of such an action.
('16', 13, 4, 30, 33287) We cannot secure her freedom by submitting petitions and the like.
('16', 13, 4, 31, 33354) Much time has passed.
('16', 13, 4, 32, 33376) We can all humbly inform the Government that if Mrs. Annie Besant is not released within the time limit prescribed by us, we
('16', 14, 0, 1, 33501) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 15
('16', 14, 1, 2, 33546) will all be compelled to follow her path.
('16', 14, 1, 3, 33588) It is possible that all of us do not like all her actions; but we find nothing in her actions which threatens the “established Government” 1 or the vested interests.
('16', 14, 1, 4, 33754) Therefore we too by participating in her activities will ask for her lot, that is, we shall all court imprisonment.
('16', 14, 1, 5, 33870) The members of our Legislative Assembly also can petition the Government and when the petition is not accepted, they can resign their membership.For swaraj also, sat yagraha is the unfailing weapon.
('16', 14, 1, 6, 34069) Satyagraha means that what we want is truth, that we deserve it and that we will work for it even untodeath.
('16', 14, 2, 7, 34178) Nothing more need be said.
('16', 14, 2, 8, 34205) Truth alone triumphs.
('16', 14, 2, 9, 34227) There is no dharma higher than Truth.
('16', 14, 2, 10, 34265) Truth always wins.
('16', 14, 2, 11, 34284) We pray to God that in this sacred land we may bring about the reign of dharma by following satyagraha and that this our country may become an example for all to follow.

('16', 14, 6, 16, 34557) MY DEAR ESTHER, I have your two letters really to answer, the last one is most touching.
('16', 14, 6, 17, 34646) The cause of the terrible pain I have suffered was within myself.
('16', 14, 6, 18, 34712) I twice ate when I ought not to have.
('16', 14, 6, 19, 34750) The result was dysentery in a most acute form.
('16', 14, 6, 20, 34797) I am now much better and am making daily progress.
('16', 14, 6, 21, 34848) In four or five days, I shall be out of bed.
('16', 14, 7, 22, 34893) With love,

('16', 15, 3, 5, 35121) Many thanks.
('16', 15, 3, 6, 35134) The decision about Viramgam has been well taken.
('16', 15, 4, 7, 35183) The question of small princely states is always present in my mind.
('16', 15, 4, 8, 35251) For the present it does not seem to advance any further.

('16', 15, 9, 13, 35483) AHMEDABAD, September 6, 1917
('16', 15, 10, 14, 35512) MY DEAR ESTHER, I was delighted to receive your note.
('16', 15, 10, 15, 35566) I hope to be in Madras for a day only on the 14th instant.
('16', 15, 10, 16, 35625) I shall have to leave on the 15th instant in the evening.
('16', 15, 10, 17, 35683) Ever since my arrival here, I have been on the move trying to spread the gospel of satyagraha in the place of methods of violence.
('16', 15, 10, 18, 35814) It is an uphill task.
('16', 15, 10, 19, 35836) You will see from the enclosed what I mean by satyagraha.
('16', 15, 10, 20, 35894) It was not my intention that your remarks upon dress

('16', 15, 11, 22, 36031) 2 Gandhiji had written to the Government and also discussed the subject of the abolition of the customs levy at Viramgam with the Governor of Bombay and the Viceroy.
('16', 15, 11, 23, 36197) The levy was abolished on November 7, 1917. Vide also.

('16', 16, 1, 3, 36437) I forgot to warn Dr. M. about it.
('16', 16, 1, 4, 36471) He liked your views so much that he could not restrain himself.
('16', 16, 1, 5, 36535) I do hope you don’t mind my sending to Dr. M. such of your letters as may appear to be helpful.
('16', 16, 1, 6, 36631) ‘To be free from desire’ is a technical expression and means desire to be or possess something short of the highest.
('16', 16, 1, 7, 36748) Thus, love of God is not ‘a desire’.
('16', 16, 1, 8, 36785) It is the natural longing.
('16', 16, 1, 9, 36812) But to possess a fortune so that I may do good is a desire and therefore to be curbed.
('16', 16, 1, 10, 36899) Our good acts must be as natural to us as the twinkling of our eyes.
('16', 16, 1, 11, 36968) Without our desiring, they act automatically.
('16', 16, 1, 12, 37014) The doing of good should be just as natural to us.

('16', 16, 7, 17, 37173) BHAISHRI BHAGWANJI 2, Will you do one thing to help me?
('16', 16, 7, 18, 37229) Will you send a brief note on the evils in every State?
('16', 16, 7, 19, 37285) I must have the freedom to publish it.
('16', 16, 7, 20, 37324) Even if you don’t give me such freedom, send the note at any rate.
('16', 16, 7, 21, 37391) For instance, I have heard that in Jamnagar there is a tax on the Brahmin’s kit and a tax to be paid on the calving of a buffalo.
('16', 16, 7, 22, 37521) In Wadhwan, hand spun yarn is taxed in three ways.
('16', 16, 7, 23, 37572) Mill yarn and mill cloth are exempt.
('16', 16, 7, 24, 37609) These are the more obvious examples I have mentioned.
('16', 16, 7, 25, 37663) I want these and the like, even graver ones.
('16', 16, 7, 26, 37708) Note the hardships resulting from laws and the manner of enforcing them.
('16', 16, 7, 27, 37781) Send the thing immediately.

('16', 17, 9, 14, 38636) THE RIGHT HON’BLE MR. E. S. MONTAGU SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA
('16', 17, 10, 15, 38701) THE PETITION OF THE BRITISH SUBJECTS OF GUJARAT
('16', 17, 11, 16, 38749) HUMBLY SHEWETH, (1) The petitioners have considered and understood the Swaraj Scheme prepared by the Council of the All India Moslem League and the All India Congress Committee and unanimously adopted last year by the Indian National Congress and the All India Moslem League.
('16', 17, 11, 17, 39025) (2) The petitioners approve of the Scheme.
('16', 17, 11, 18, 39068) (3) In the humble opinion of the petitioners, the reforms
('16', 17, 12, 19, 39126) 1 The date is fixed on the basis of Gandhiji’s tour itinerary given in the letter.
('16', 17, 12, 20, 39209) 2 This was drafted by Gandhiji in Gujarati as stated in “Circular Letter by Gujarat Sabha”, 13 9 1917; Vide Appendix “Circular Letter By Gujarat Sabha Office”, 13 9 1917 Identical petitions were presented in other Indian languages; for example, the Hindi petition reproduced at page 521 of Select Documents on Mahatma Gandhi’s Movement in Champaran.
('16', 18, 0, 1, 39559) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 19
('16', 18, 1, 2, 39604) proposed in the aforementioned Scheme are absolutely necessary in the interests of India and the Empire.
('16', 18, 1, 3, 39709) (4) It is further the petitioner’s belief that without such reforms India will not witness the era of true contentment.
('16', 18, 1, 4, 39829) For these reasons the petitioners respectfully pray that you will be pleased to give full consideration and accept the reform proposals and thus render successful your visit taken at great inconvenience and fulfil the national hope.
('16', 18, 1, 5, 40062) And for this act of kindness the petitioners shall for ever remain grateful.

('16', 18, 5, 9, 40262) [Before September 13, 1917]
('16', 18, 6, 10, 40290) Mr. Gandhi also devised the following rules for the Volunteers to obtain signatures: 1. In taking signatures to the petition, first it must be ascertained whether the person signing correctly understands the scheme described in the petition or not.
('16', 18, 6, 11, 40539) 2. In order to make people understand the scheme, it should be read out to the inhabitants of the place, called together by a notification prepared by the Sabha.
('16', 18, 6, 12, 40701) If in such reading the people raise any new question, which cannot be answered out of the Foreword, then the Volunteer should not decide the point himself but should refer it to the Chief of his own Circle; and the questioner should not be allowed to sign so long as he has not been satisfied.
('16', 18, 6, 13, 40995) 3. It should be clearly kept in mind that no kind of pressure is to be used on any inhabitant of any place.
('16', 18, 6, 14, 41103) 4. Care should be taken that Government servants, as also people
('16', 18, 7, 15, 41168) 1 These were framed by Gandhiji; vide “Circular Letter by Gujarat Sabha Office”, 13 9 1917.
('16', 19, 0, 1, 41260) 20 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 19, 1, 2, 41301) who are unable to understand, do not sign by oversight.
('16', 19, 1, 3, 41357) 5. Signatures should not be taken from young people, who appear to be under the age of eighteen.
('16', 19, 1, 4, 41454) 6. Signatures should not be taken from school going students, whatever their age may be.
('16', 19, 1, 5, 41543) 7. There is no objection in taking signatures from any man or woman if the Volunteer is convinced that he or she can understand the matter.
('16', 19, 1, 6, 41683) 8. A man or woman, who is unable to read or write, should be made to put his or her cross and an authentication of it by a well known person of the place should be placed opposite the cross.
('16', 19, 1, 7, 41874) 9. It should be kept in mind that each signature is to be taken on two forms.
('16', 19, 1, 8, 41952) 10. The papers should be preserved without being soiled or crumpled.
('16', 19, 1, 9, 42021) 11. The papers which are not signed should at once be sent to the Head Office; and a report should at once be sent to the Head Office from the place where a meeting has been held or some attempt made.
('16', 19, 1, 10, 42222) 12. The Volunteer has no authority to make any speech on any subject outside the scope of petition or on any subject relating to but not included in the Foreword.
('16', 19, 1, 11, 42385) 13. First the inhabitants of a place should be called together and the Foreword read out to them and their signatures taken.
('16', 19, 1, 12, 42510) After that as many houses as can as be practicable should be visited and the signatures of the rest of the men and women taken.
('16', 19, 1, 13, 42638) But these should be taken only after the Foreword has been explained.
('16', 19, 1, 14, 42708) 14. If while visiting places or calling together people, the police or any other officials object, the Volunteer should politely reply that so long as the Head Office does not direct the cessation of work, he would have to continue his work.
('16', 19, 1, 15, 42950) If in doing this, he is arrested by the police, he should allow himself to be arrested, but he should not resist the police.
('16', 19, 1, 16, 43075) And if such a thing happens, he should at once send a detailed report to the Head Office.
('16', 19, 1, 17, 43165) If people themselves hesitate to gather together through the fear of the police or for any other cause, the Volunteer should give up that place and should at once give information of such an occurrence to the Head Office.

('16', 20, 6, 7, 43885) [Before September 16, 1917]
('16', 20, 7, 8, 43913) DEAR SATYANAND BABU, Mr. Polak had sent me your letter of inquiry about Passive Resistance.
('16', 20, 7, 9, 44005) I have time only to give you the briefest reply to your questions.
('16', 20, 7, 10, 44072) P. R., as conceived by me, is soul force, and essentially a religious principle.
('16', 20, 7, 11, 44153) Its scope, therefore, takes in every variety of wrong.
('16', 20, 7, 12, 44208) It is a force as old as the world itself.
('16', 20, 7, 13, 44250) Consider the conduct of Prahlad, Daniel, Jesus, Mirabai and others whose guiding principle in life has been religion.
('16', 20, 7, 14, 44368) Indians in South Africa made use, more or less, of this force, and they were successful only to the extent that they used it to the exclusion of every other force.
('16', 20, 7, 15, 44532) From whom did the idea first originate, is your second question.
('16', 20, 7, 16, 44597) In view of the meaning I have given to the expression, no reply seems to be necessary.
('16', 20, 7, 17, 44684) But it may be stated that so far as its use on the political platform is concerned, the idea may be said to have originated with me.
('16', 20, 7, 18, 44817) I knew nothing of it, but Tolstoy drew my attention to it.
('16', 20, 7, 19, 44876) At the time of the Controversy on the Education Bill passed by the House of Commons and the so called Passive Resistance offered by Dr. Clifford 3 and others, Mr. Winston
('16', 20, 8, 20, 45047) 1 Mrs. Besant 2 This was in reply to the addressee’s letter dated August 15, 1917 to Polak.
('16', 20, 8, 21, 45139) 3 John Clifford (1836 1923), British Non conformist minister and liberal politician, who led the “Passive Resistance” movement against the Education Bill of 1902 by non payment of taxes.
('16', 21, 0, 1, 45326) 22 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 21, 1, 2, 45367) Churchill 1 said that P. R. was perfectly constitutional under the British Constitution.
('16', 21, 1, 3, 45456) A similar pronouncement was made by Gen.
('16', 21, 1, 4, 45497) Smuts, with regard to our Passive Resistance when demand was made by Senator Whiteside for my deportation side by side with that of the nine Englishmen who were deported in connection with the European Railway strike that had just then ended.
('16', 21, 1, 5, 45740) I am unable, offhand, to give any reference from a constitu tional lawyer.
('16', 21, 2, 6, 45815) Your fifth question requires historical precedents.
('16', 21, 2, 7, 45867) This is answered in para.
('16', 21, 2, 8, 45893) 2. Your sixth question, whether it comes within constitutional methods needs no answer.
('16', 21, 2, 9, 45981) I am sorry for the delay that has taken place in replying.
('16', 21, 2, 10, 46040) I am in Ahmedabad up to the 16th September, then prepare to leave for Bihar.

('16', 21, 4, 12, 46189) 15. THE MORAL BASIS OF CO OPERATION 3
('16', 21, 5, 13, 46227) The only claim I have on your indulgence is that some months ago I attended with Mr. Ewbank a meeting of mill hands to whom he wanted to explain the principles of co operation.
('16', 21, 5, 14, 46404) The chawl 4
('16', 21, 6, 15, 46416) in which they were living was as filthy as it well could be.
('16', 21, 6, 16, 46477) Recent rains had made matters worse.
('16', 21, 6, 17, 46514) And I must frankly confess that had not it been for Mr. Ewbank’s great zeal for the cause he has made his own, I should have shirked the task.
('16', 21, 6, 18, 46657) But there we were, seated on a fairly worn out charpai 5, surrounded by men, women and children.
('16', 21, 6, 19, 46754) Mr. Ewbank opened fire on a man who had put himself forward and who wore not a particularly innocent countenance.
('16', 21, 6, 20, 46868) After he had engaged him and the other people about him in Gujarati conversation,
('16', 21, 7, 21, 46950) 1 Sir Winston (Leonard Spencer) Churchill (1874 ), British statesman and writer; Under Secretary for Colonies, 1905 8 (Gandhiji first met him during his deputation to England in 1906); Minister of Munitions, 1917; Secretary for War, 1918 21; Prime Minister, 1940 5, 1951 5; awarded Nobel Prize for Literature, 1953 2 Questions 4 and 5 were: “4. Did any constitutional lawyer deal with the subject?

('16', 22, 1, 2, 47587) he wanted me to speak to the people.
('16', 22, 1, 3, 47624) Owing to the suspicious looks of the man who was first spoken to, I naturally pressed home the moralities of co operation.
('16', 22, 1, 4, 47747) I fancy that Mr. Ewbank rather liked the manner in which I handled the subject.
('16', 22, 1, 5, 47827) Hence, I believe, his kind invitation to me to tax your patience for a few moments upon a consideration of co operation from a moral standpoint.
('16', 22, 1, 6, 47972) My knowledge of the technicality of co operation is next to nothing.
('16', 22, 1, 7, 48041) My brother Devdhar has made the subject his own.
('16', 22, 1, 8, 48090) Whatever he does naturally attracts me and predisposes me to think that there must be something good in it and the handling of it must be fairly difficult.
('16', 22, 1, 9, 48246) Mr. Ewbank very kindly placed at my disposal some literature too on the subject.
('16', 22, 1, 10, 48327) And I have had a unique opportunity of watching the effect of some co operative effort in Champaran.
('16', 22, 1, 11, 48428) I have gone through Mr. Ewbank’s ten main points which are like the commandments, and I have gone through the twelve points of Mr. Collins of Behar, which remind me of the law of the twelve tables.
('16', 22, 1, 12, 48626) There are so called agricultural banks in Champaran.
('16', 22, 1, 13, 48679) They were to me disappointing efforts, if they were meant to be demonstrations of the success of co operation.
('16', 22, 1, 14, 48790) On the other hand, there is quiet work in the same direction being done by Mr. Hodge, a missionary whose efforts are leaving their impression on those who come in contact with him.
('16', 22, 1, 15, 48971) Mr. Hodge is a co operative enthusiast and probably considers that the results which he sees flowing from his efforts are due to the working of co operation.
('16', 22, 1, 16, 49129) I who was able to watch the two efforts had no hesitation in inferring that the personal equation counted for success in the one and failure in the other instance.
('16', 22, 1, 17, 49293) I am an enthusiast myself, but twenty five years of experimenting and experience have made me a cautious and discriminating enthusiast.
('16', 22, 1, 18, 49429) Workers in a cause necessarily, though quite unconsciously, exaggerate its merits and often succeed in turning its very defects into advantages.
('16', 22, 1, 19, 49574) In spite of my caution I consider the little institution 1 I am conducting in Ahmedabad as the finest thing in the world.
('16', 22, 1, 20, 49696) It alone gives me sufficient inspiration.
('16', 22, 1, 21, 49738) Critics tell me that it represents a soulless soul force and that its severe discipline has made it merely mechanical.
('16', 22, 1, 22, 49857) I suppose both—the critics and I—are wrong.
('16', 22, 1, 23, 49901) It is, at best, a humble attempt to place at the disposal of the nation a home where men and women may have scope for free and unfettered development of character, in keeping with the national genius, and if
('16', 22, 2, 24, 50109) 1 Satyagraha Ashram
('16', 23, 0, 1, 50129) 24 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 23, 1, 2, 50170) its controllers do not take care, the discipline that is the foundation of character, may frustrate the very end in view.
('16', 23, 1, 3, 50292) I would venture, therefore, to warn enthusiasts in co operation against entertaining false hopes.
('16', 23, 1, 4, 50390) With Sir Daniel Hamilton, it has become a religion.
('16', 23, 1, 5, 50442) On the 13th January last, he addressed the students of the Scottish Churches College, and in order to point a moral he instanced Scotland’s poverty of two hundred years ago and showed how that great country was raised from a condition of poverty to plenty.
('16', 23, 1, 6, 50699) He said:
('16', 23, 2, 7, 50708) There were two powers which raised her—the Scottish Church and the Scottish banks.
('16', 23, 2, 8, 50791) The Church manufactured the men and the banks manufactured the money to give the men a start in life....
('16', 23, 2, 9, 50896) The Church disciplined the nation in the fear of God which is the beginning of wisdom and in the parish schools of the Church, the children learned that the chief end of man’s life was to glorify God and to enjoy Him for ever.
('16', 23, 2, 10, 51123) Men were trained to believe in God and in themselves, and on the trustworthy character so created, the Scottish banking system was built.
('16', 23, 2, 11, 51261) Sir Daniel then shows that it was possible to build up the marvellous Scottish banking system only on the character so built.
('16', 23, 2, 12, 51387) So far there can only be perfect agreement with Sir Daniel, for ‘Without character there is no co operation’ is a sound maxim.
('16', 23, 2, 13, 51514) But he would have us go much further.
('16', 23, 2, 14, 51552) He thus waxes eloquent on co operation:
('16', 23, 3, 15, 51592) Whatever may be your day dreams of India’s future, never forget this that it is to weld India into one, and so enable her to take her rightful place in the world, that the British Government is here; and the welding hammer in the hand of the Government is the co operative movement.
('16', 23, 3, 16, 51875) In his opinion, it is the panacea of all the evils that afflict India at the present moment.
('16', 23, 3, 17, 51968) In its extended sense it can justify the claim on one condition which need not be mentioned here; in the limited sense in which Sir Daniel has used it, I venture to think, it is an enthusiast’s exaggeration.
('16', 23, 3, 18, 52176) Mark his peroration:
('16', 23, 4, 19, 52197) Credit which is only Trust and Faith, is becoming more and more the money power of the world, and in the parchment bullet into which is impressed the faith which removes mountains, India will find victory and peace.
('16', 23, 4, 20, 52413) Here there is evident confusion of thought.
('16', 23, 4, 21, 52457) The credit which is becoming the money power of the world has little moral basis and is not a synonym for Trust or Faith, which are purely moral qualities.
('16', 23, 4, 22, 52613) After twenty years’ experience of hundreds of men, who had dealings with banks in South Africa, the opinion I had so often heard expressed has become firmly rooted in me, that the greater the rascal,
('16', 24, 0, 1, 52813) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 25
('16', 24, 1, 2, 52858) the greater the credit he enjoys with his banks.
('16', 24, 1, 3, 52907) The banks do not pry into his moral character; they are satisfied that he meets his over drafts and promissory notes punctually.
('16', 24, 1, 4, 53036) The credit system has encircled this beautiful globe of ours like a serpent’s coil, and if we do not mind, it bids fair to crush us out of breath.
('16', 24, 1, 5, 53183) I have witnessed the ruin of many a home through the system, and it has made no difference whether the credit was labelled co operative or otherwise.
('16', 24, 1, 6, 53333) The deadly coil has made possible the devastating spectacle in Europe, which we are helplessly looking on.
('16', 24, 1, 7, 53440) It was perhaps never so true as it is to day that as in law so in war the longest purse finally wins.
('16', 24, 1, 8, 53542) I have ventured to give prominence to the current belief about credit system in order to emphasise the point that the co operative movement will be a blessing to India only to the extent that it is a moral movement strictly directed by men fired with religious fervour.
('16', 24, 1, 9, 53812) It follows, therefore, that co operation should be confined to men wishing to be morally right, but failing to do so, because of grinding poverty or of the grip of the mahajan 1. Facility for obtaining loans at fair rates will not make immoral or unmoral men moral.
('16', 24, 1, 10, 54078) But the wisdom of the State or philanthropists demands that they should help, on the onward path, men struggling to be good.
('16', 24, 1, 11, 54203) Too often do we believe that material prosperity means moral growth.
('16', 24, 1, 12, 54272) It is necessary that a movement which is fraught with so much good to India should not degenerate into one for merely advancing cheap loans.
('16', 24, 1, 13, 54413) I was therefore delighted to read the recommendation in the Report of the Committee on Co operation in India, that
('16', 24, 2, 14, 54528) they wish clearly to express their opinion that it is to true co operation alone, that is, to a co operation which recognises the moral aspect of the question that Government must look for the amelioration of the masses and not to a pseudo co operative edifice, however imposing, which is built in ignorance of co operative, principles.
('16', 24, 2, 15, 54865) With this standard before us, we will not measure the success of the movement by the number of co operative societies formed, but by the moral condition of the co operators.
('16', 24, 2, 16, 55039) The Registrars will in that event ensure the moral growth of existing societies before multiplying them.
('16', 24, 2, 17, 55144) And the Government will make their promotion conditional, not upon the number of societies they have registered, but the moral success of the existing institutions.
('16', 24, 2, 18, 55309) This will mean tracing the course of every pice lent to the members.
('16', 24, 2, 19, 55378) Those responsible for

('16', 25, 0, 1, 55414) 26 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 25, 1, 2, 55455) the proper conduct of co operative societies will see to it that the money advanced does not find its way into the toddy sellers’ till or into the pockets of the keepers of gambling dens.
('16', 25, 1, 3, 55643) I would excuse the rapacity of the mahajan if it has succeeded in keeping the gambling die or toddy from the ryot’s home.
('16', 25, 2, 4, 55765) A word perhaps about the mahajan will not be out of place.
('16', 25, 2, 5, 55824) Co operation is not a new device.
('16', 25, 2, 6, 55858) The ryots co operate to drum out monkeys or birds that destroy their crops.
('16', 25, 2, 7, 55934) They co operate to use a common thrashing floor.
('16', 25, 2, 8, 55983) I have found them co operate to protect their cattle to the extent of their devoting their best land for the grazing of their cattle.
('16', 25, 2, 9, 56117) And they have been found co operating against a particularly rapacious mahajan.
('16', 25, 2, 10, 56197) Doubt has been expressed as to the success of co operation because of the tightness of the mahajan’s hold on the ryots.
('16', 25, 2, 11, 56317) I do not share the fears.
('16', 25, 2, 12, 56343) The mightiest mahajan must, if he represents an evil force, bend before co operation, conceived as an essentially moral movement.
('16', 25, 2, 13, 56473) But my limited experience of the mahajan of Champaran has made me revise the accepted opinion about his ‘blighting influence’.
('16', 25, 2, 14, 56600) I have found him to be not always relentless, not always exacting of the last pie.
('16', 25, 2, 15, 56683) He sometimes serves his clients in many ways or even comes to their rescue in the hour of their distress.
('16', 25, 2, 16, 56789) My observation is so limited that I dare not draw any conclusions from it, but I respectfully enquire whether it is not possible to make a serious effort to draw out the good in the mahajan and help him or induce him to throw out the evil in him.
('16', 25, 2, 17, 57036) May he not be induced to join the army of co operation, or has experience proved that he is past praying for?
('16', 25, 3, 18, 57146) I note that the movement takes note of all indigenous industries.
('16', 25, 3, 19, 57212) I beg publicly to express my gratitude to Government for helping me in my humble effort to improve the lot of the weaver.
('16', 25, 3, 20, 57334) The experiment I am conducting shows that there is a vast field for work in this direction.
('16', 25, 3, 21, 57426) No well wisher of India, no patriot dare look upon the impending destruction of the handloom weaver with equanimity.
('16', 25, 3, 22, 57543) As Dr. Mann has stated, this industry used to supply the peasant with an additional source of livelihood and an insurance against famine.
('16', 25, 3, 23, 57681) Every Registrar who will nurse back to life this important and graceful industry will earn the gratitude of India.
('16', 25, 3, 24, 57796) My humble effort consists of, firstly, in making researches as to the possibilities of simple reforms in the orthodox handlooms, secondly, in weaning the educated youth from the craving for Government or other service and the feeling that
('16', 26, 0, 1, 58035) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 27
('16', 26, 1, 2, 58080) education renders him unfit for independent occupation and inducing him to take to weaving as a calling as honourable as that of a barrister or a doctor, and, thirdly, by helping those who have abandoned their occupation to revert to it.
('16', 26, 1, 3, 58318) I will not weary the audience with any statement on the first two parts of the experiment.
('16', 26, 1, 4, 58409) The third may be allowed a few sentences as it has a direct bearing upon the subject before us.
('16', 26, 1, 5, 58505) I was able to enter upon it only six months ago.
('16', 26, 1, 6, 58554) Five families that had left off the calling have reverted to it and they are doing a prosperous business.
('16', 26, 1, 7, 58660) The Ashram supplies them at their door with the yarn they need; it volunteers to take delivery of the cloth woven, paying them cash at the market rate.
('16', 26, 1, 8, 58812) The Ashram merely loses interest on the loan advanced for the yarn.
('16', 26, 1, 9, 58880) It has as yet suffered no loss and is able to restrict its loss to a minimum by limiting the loan to a particular figure.
('16', 26, 1, 10, 59002) All future transactions are strictly cash.
('16', 26, 1, 11, 59045) We are able to command a ready sale for the cloth received.
('16', 26, 1, 12, 59105) The loss of interest, therefore, on the transaction is negligible.
('16', 26, 1, 13, 59172) I would like the audience to note its purely moral character from start to finish.
('16', 26, 1, 14, 59255) The Ashram depends for its existence on such help as friends render it.
('16', 26, 1, 15, 59327) We, therefore, can have no warrant for charging interest.
('16', 26, 1, 16, 59385) The weavers could not be saddled with it.
('16', 26, 1, 17, 59427) Whole families that were breaking to pieces are put together again.
('16', 26, 1, 18, 59495) The use of the loan is predetermined.
('16', 26, 1, 19, 59533) And we the middlemen being volunteers obtain the privilege of entering into the lives of these families 1 hope for their and our betterment.
('16', 26, 1, 20, 59674) We cannot lift them without being lifted ourselves.
('16', 26, 1, 21, 59726) This last relationship has not yet been developed, but we hope at an early date to take in hand the education too of these families and not rest satisfied till we have touched them at every point.
('16', 26, 1, 22, 59923) This is not too ambitious a dream.
('16', 26, 1, 23, 59958) God willing, it will be a reality some day.
('16', 26, 1, 24, 60002) I have ventured to dilate upon the small experiment to illustrate what I mean by co operation to present it to others for imitation.
('16', 26, 1, 25, 60135) Let us be sure of our ideal.
('16', 26, 1, 26, 60164) We shall ever fail to realise it, but we should never cease to strive for it.
('16', 26, 1, 27, 60242) Then there need be no fear of “co operation of scoundrels” that Ruskin so rightly dreaded.

('16', 27, 2, 3, 60491) RANCHI, [Adhik Aso Sud 7, September 23, 1917] 1
('16', 27, 3, 4, 60539) MAGANLAL, It is twelve days since I left you.
('16', 27, 3, 5, 60585) Out of the eleven days, nine I spent on the train and only two nights at a friend’s.
('16', 27, 3, 6, 60670) Despite this, my health has not suffered.
('16', 27, 3, 7, 60712) I had regular food today after eleven days.
('16', 27, 3, 8, 60756) I had discussions with Amritlalbhai 2 in Bombay about the Ashram buildings.
('16', 27, 3, 9, 60832) Chhaganlal must have written to you.
('16', 27, 3, 10, 60869) He made some very weighty suggestions, the most important being that we cannot escape using wood.
('16', 27, 3, 11, 60967) There will be some difficulty about the foundation.
('16', 27, 3, 12, 61019) It just will not hold there, and the only way out is to have wood work filled in with brick.
('16', 27, 3, 13, 61112) The library, he said, would have to be lengthened, otherwise there would not be enough light.
('16', 27, 3, 14, 61206) He will himself write in detail about all this.
('16', 27, 3, 15, 61254) I hope you remember that you have to carry with you the lamp, with its post, from Jivanlalbhai’s bungalow.
('16', 27, 3, 16, 61361) We shall need them.
('16', 27, 3, 17, 61381) Amritlalbhai suggested that the wood should be thickly painted all round with coal tar.
('16', 27, 3, 18, 61469) Provide for good latrines and urinals from the very start.
('16', 27, 3, 19, 61528) Money spent on them will be well spent.
('16', 27, 3, 20, 61568) It will also be necessary to provide for quick draining away of sewage.
('16', 27, 3, 21, 61640) I think it needful that you collect in the Ashram stone, gravel, etc., wherever and in whatever quantity available.
('16', 27, 3, 22, 61756) Plan the roads fairly broad and get them ready soon.
('16', 27, 3, 23, 61809) I see that I shall have to stay longer in Ranchi than I had thought.
('16', 27, 3, 24, 61878) The sittings start on Monday.

('16', 27, 7, 27, 62011) 1 Gandhiji left Ahmedabad on September 11 and arrived at Ranchi, via Bombay, Madras and Poona, on September 22, spending nine days on the train.
('16', 27, 7, 28, 62156) Again, the first meeting of the second session of the Champaran Enquiry Committee, which is referred to at the end of the letter, was held on Monday, September 24 at Ranchi.

('16', 28, 2, 3, 62523) RANCHI, September 24, 1917
('16', 28, 3, 4, 62550) The President said that he understood that Mr. Gandhi had some remarks to make about the draft report which had been circulated.
('16', 28, 3, 5, 62679) Mr. Gandhi said that he had an interview with His Honour the Lieutenant Governor and understood from him that arbitration on the conflicting claims as to sharahbeshi was possible.
('16', 28, 3, 6, 62859) The President
('16', 28, 4, 7, 62873) said that during the time he had been in Ranchi he had discussed this matter with the local Government and had pointed out that there were three possible courses:
('16', 28, 5, 8, 63036) (1) for the local Government to arbitrate,
('16', 28, 6, 9, 63079) (2) for the Bettiah estate to meet the difference of 25 per cent, or
('16', 28, 7, 10, 63148) (3) for the question to be left to a special tribunal.
('16', 28, 8, 11, 63203) He understood that the local Government was not prepared to arbitrate but was prepared to consider the second suggestion after consulting the local officers.
('16', 28, 8, 12, 63361) The latter were, however, opposed to the idea and when he himself had put it to the planters principally concerned, viz., Messrs Norman, Hill and Irwin, he gathered that they also were not in favour of it.
('16', 28, 8, 13, 63567) He, therefore, understood that the local Government had abandoned all idea of the first and second alternatives and the report was consequently drafted on the assumption that the third alternative would be adopted.
('16', 28, 8, 14, 63782) Mr. Gandhi said that he thought that Sir Edward Gait would be prepared to arbitrate and suggested that the matter might be referred to him.
('16', 28, 8, 15, 63922) Mr. Rainy pointed out that it would he necessary to ascertain first whether the parties were willing.
('16', 28, 8, 16, 64024) The President said that it was necessary, before the matter was referred to His Honour, to decide one or two points.
('16', 28, 8, 17, 64141) The first was as to Turkaulia.
('16', 28, 8, 18, 64172) Mr. Hill had not agreed to a reduction in sharahbeshi larger than 20 per cent and Mr. Gandhi had said that he was prepared to
('16', 28, 9, 19, 64298) consider special cases.
('16', 28, 9, 20, 64322) The President asked, therefore, whether he would agree in the case of Turkaulia for the arbitration to be between the limits of 20 per cent and 40 per cent.
('16', 28, 9, 21, 64479) Mr. Gandhi agreed to this.
('16', 28, 9, 22, 64506) The President said that the second point was, supposing some of the planters agreed and some did not, was the arbitration to be recommended in the case of those who agreed?
('16', 28, 9, 23, 64679) Mr. Gandhi said that he thought if any concerns preferred to fight out their case in the ordinary courts, he would have no objection to their doing so.
('16', 28, 9, 24, 64831) Mr. Reid agreed to this.
('16', 28, 9, 25, 64856) The President then asked whether Mr. Gandhi intended the arbitration to be done by His Honour personally or by the local Government.
('16', 28, 9, 26, 64989) Mr. Gandhi said that he thought it should be done by His Honour personally and the Committee agreed.
('16', 28, 9, 27, 65090) Mr. Reid enquired whether His Honour would fix a separate figure for each factory.
('16', 28, 9, 28, 65173) Mr. Gandhi said he thought it was not necessary
('16', 29, 0, 1, 65221) 30 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 29, 1, 2, 65262) to go into details and that this could be left to His Honour.
('16', 29, 1, 3, 65324) The President then pointed out that, supposing the arbitration was undertaken, it was necessary to give the planters some assurance that the award would be made binding on the raiyats.
('16', 29, 2, 4, 65509) Adami said that this would require legislation.
('16', 29, 2, 5, 65557) Mr. Gandhi, however, thought that it would be simpler and just as binding as legislation, if he got a power of attorney from the raiyats to act on their behalf.
('16', 29, 2, 6, 65718) This would not cause so much delay and probably be
('16', 29, 3, 7, 65769) less troublesome on the whole than special legislation.
('16', 29, 3, 8, 65825) The President asked what was to be done in the case of those raiyats who were not paying sharahbeshi and against
('16', 29, 4, 9, 65938) whom the indigo obligation was recorded.
('16', 29, 4, 10, 65979) Mr. Gandhi said that they should have the option of commuting the obligation at whatever rate might eventually be awarded.
('16', 29, 4, 11, 66102) The President pointed out that the Committee had already agreed that the tinkathia
('16', 29, 5, 12, 66185) system was so bad that it ought to be abolished.
('16', 29, 5, 13, 66234) Mr. Gandhi said that in spite of that he could not see why raiyats should be compelled to pay enhanced rents if they did not wish to.
('16', 29, 5, 14, 66368) He was prepared to try and get a power of attorney from such raiyats but the raiyats should not be compelled to agree to the arbitration.
('16', 29, 5, 15, 66506) Mr. Reid said he
('16', 29, 6, 16, 66523) thought that there would be great delay in getting the power of attorney and the President asked what would happen if the raiyats repudiated it subsequently.
('16', 29, 6, 17, 66681) Mr. Gandhi said that in that case the raiyats would have to fight, but that was not likely.
('16', 29, 7, 18, 66773) He would agree to the following being put in the report, “In order to protect the planters in the matter of acceptance by the raiyats of the Lieutenant Governor’s award, Mr. Gandhi would undertake to obtain a power of attorney from the raiyats concerned.” He added that it might be simpler if the raiyats simply signed an
('16', 29, 8, 19, 67095) agreement that they would accept the figure fixed by the Lieutenant Governor.
('16', 29, 8, 20, 67173) The President enquired whether if arbitration was to take place before this agreement was obtained, it would be right to go to the raiyats and ask them to sign it subsequent to
('16', 29, 9, 21, 67350) the arbitration.
('16', 29, 9, 22, 67367) Mr. Gandhi said that in that case it would not be a power of attorney but would be a legal acceptance.
('16', 29, 9, 23, 67470) Mr. Rainy said that what was required was something which the raiyat could not question if the planter had to bring a suit for arrears of
('16', 29, 10, 24, 67608) Mr. Reid pointed out that if the attested rent had to be revised in the record, legislation would be necessary and a separate agreement would be required from each raiyat specifying the terms which had been settled in each particular case.
('16', 29, 11, 25, 67848) President said that the difficulty was that while with the planters the Committee were dealing with principals, with raiyats they were dealing with the representatives.
('16', 29, 12, 26, 68017) two methods which had been proposed to get over this were
('16', 29, 13, 27, 68075) (1) to get a power of attorney from the raiyats before arbitration which
('16', 29, 14, 28, 68148) would be a lengthy process, and
('16', 29, 15, 29, 68180) (2) that Mr. Gandhi should obtain a legal acceptance after arbitration.
('16', 29, 16, 30, 68252) Mr. Adami said that if the second suggestion was adopted, an agreement would have to be taken from every raiyats and registered, The President pointed out that in
('16', 30, 0, 1, 68415) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 31
('16', 30, 1, 2, 68460) that case the expense would be considerable and it would have to be decided who was to bear it.
('16', 30, 1, 3, 68556) Mr. Gandhi said that to get the power of attorney, it would take at least a month.
('16', 30, 1, 4, 68639) Mr. Reid thought that legislation would be preferable.
('16', 30, 1, 5, 68694) Mr. Rainy pointed out that it would be difficult to have the arbitration before the power of attorney was obtained and asked whether Mr. Gandhi would not agree to recommend that the settlement should be made binding by legislation, if necessary.
('16', 30, 1, 6, 68940) Mr. Gandhi agreed to that.
('16', 30, 1, 7, 68967) Mr. Reid said that he understood that in any case legislation was necessary to abolish the tinkathia system and he saw no reason therefore why provisions as to sharahbeshi should not also be included.
('16', 30, 1, 8, 69168) The President said he thought that the
('16', 30, 2, 9, 69207) proposal for special legislation was to some extent gambling on the Legislative Council but the members generally thought there would be no difficulty about this.
('16', 30, 2, 10, 69370) It was finally agreed that the President should go to His Honour with the unanimous request that he should arbitrate on the following basis:
('16', 30, 3, 11, 69511) (l) In the case of Turkaulia between the limits of 20 per cent and 40 per cent reduction in sharahbeshi.
('16', 30, 4, 12, 69616) (2) In Pipra, Motihari, Jallaha and Sirni between the limits of 25 per cent and 40 per cent reduction.
('16', 30, 5, 13, 69719) The arbitration was only to take place where the concerns agreed.
('16', 30, 5, 14, 69785) Any concern which did not agree would be left to the agency of the ordinary courts.
('16', 30, 5, 15, 69869) The award might vary for different concerns and although Mr. Gandhi would prefer to omit this qualification, he would prefer to retain it rather than that the arbitration should fail.
('16', 30, 5, 16, 70053) Where the indigo obligation was recorded, the raiyat was to have the option of
('16', 30, 6, 17, 70132) continuing under the obligation or of commuting it at the rates fixed by the arbitration.
('16', 30, 6, 18, 70222) Effect was to be given to the award by emergency legislation.
('16', 30, 7, 19, 70284) The President then said that in case His Honour agreed to arbitrate, the report would presumably simply state this fact.
('16', 30, 7, 20, 70405) Mr. Gandhi said that he would prefer the arbitration to take place first of all and the figure arrived at to be incorporated in the report as their recommendation with the additional recommendation that legislation should be undertaken to enforce it.
('16', 30, 7, 21, 70656) The Committee agreed to this.
('16', 30, 8, 22, 70686) The President then said that they had now to consider the report and he asked Mr. Gandhi to put his general views before the meeting.
('16', 30, 8, 23, 70820) Mr. Gandhi said that he thought that for their purpose, the report was too heavy and that the Committee were not warranted in giving such a lengthy history after a summary enquiry.
('16', 30, 8, 24, 71001) He pointed out that the materials were all in the Government record and on the terms of reference they had merely to report conclusions without giving the reasons.
('16', 30, 8, 25, 71165) His experience was that arbitrators who did not give reasons always did well.
('16', 30, 8, 26, 71243) The President agreed, provided that the report was unanimous.
('16', 30, 9, 27, 71305) The President said that one point which had not been dealt with in the report was the case of tawan in mukarrari villages.
('16', 30, 9, 28, 71428) The report dealt with the case
('16', 31, 0, 1, 71459) 32 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 31, 1, 2, 71500) of tawan in thika villages only.
('16', 31, 1, 3, 71533) He referred specially to the case of Rajpur.
('16', 31, 1, 4, 71578) Mr. Gandhi said he thought that Mr. Hudson ought to repay part of the tawan, as he had lost nothing by replacing tinkathia indigo by khuski indigo.
('16', 31, 1, 5, 71726) If necessary, the
('16', 31, 2, 6, 71744) payment could be enforced by special legislation.
('16', 31, 3, 7, 71794) The President then brought forward a note of dissent put in by the Hon’ble Raja Kirtyanand Sinha as to the recommendation made in regard to sections 75 and 58 of the Bengal Tenancy Act.
('16', 31, 3, 8, 71980) As to the amendment in section 75, Mr. Adami pointed out that the principle of having two alternative procedures for dealing with an infringement had already been accepted by the Legislature in section 58, so that the objection on this ground was not valid.
('16', 31, 3, 9, 72238) Mr. Gandhi said that the objection on the ground that a legal point might arise seemed more valid but this would be provided for because there would be an appeal to the Commissioner.
('16', 31, 3, 10, 72421) The President pointed out that the recommendation was practically to make the section the same as in the Chhota Nagpur Tenancy Act and asked the Raja if he would not agree to the recommendation if it was restricted to the Champaran district.
('16', 31, 3, 11, 72663) Raja Kirtyanand Sinha said that on this condition he was willing to agree.
('16', 31, 4, 12, 72738) Select Documents on Mahatma Gandhi’s Movement in Champaran, No.
('16', 31, 6, 13, 72802) 18. MINUTES OF CHAMPARAN COMMITTEE MEETING
('16', 31, 7, 14, 72845) RANCHI, September 25, 1917
('16', 31, 8, 15, 72872) The President said he had seen the Lieutenant Governor who had said that he was not prepared to give a definite reply to the proposal that he should arbitrate and pointed out that it would be a somewhat difficult position for him since, as the head of the Government, he would have to deal with the report.
('16', 31, 8, 16, 73179) The Lieutenant Governor had, therefore, suggested that it might be preferable if a High Court Judge was appointed to arbitrate.
('16', 31, 8, 17, 73307) Mr. Gandhi said that he did not contemplate such a stiff and formal arbitration.
('16', 31, 8, 18, 73388) It was not a legal mind that was required for this arbitration but a business mind.
('16', 31, 8, 19, 73472) Mr. Reid said that he was doubtful whether Messers Irwin and Hill would agree to arbitration and he was certain that they would not agree to arbitration by a High Court Judge.
('16', 31, 8, 20, 73648) The President said that in that case it was hardly worthwhile to go on with the proposal to arbitrate.
('16', 31, 8, 21, 73751) Mr. Gandhi agreed but said he still had hopes of bringing about an arbitration.
('16', 31, 9, 22, 73831) Turning to the discussion of the report, the President said that, in considering whether the introductory historical portion should be cut down, it had to be remembered that it was desirable to make the report as a whole intelligent to the
('16', 32, 0, 1, 74071) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 33
('16', 32, 1, 2, 74116) public and not to make it appear as if the Committee had shirked their tasks.
('16', 32, 1, 3, 74194) Mr. Rainy said he had no objection to cutting down Chapter II.
('16', 32, 1, 4, 74257) Mr. Adami was inclined to keep Chapter II as it was.
('16', 32, 1, 5, 74310) Raja Kirtyanand Sinha suggested that the paragraph about the thikadari system might be shortened.
('16', 32, 1, 6, 74408) Mr. Reid said that he saw no objection to
('16', 32, 2, 7, 74450) Chapter II standing.
('16', 32, 2, 8, 74471) It was necessary to enable anyone to grasp the problem as it stood at present.
('16', 32, 2, 9, 74550) Mr. Gandhi said that if the report was not to be unanimous, he could understand and would not resist the desire of the majority to state their argument fully.
('16', 32, 2, 10, 74709) The President said that Mr. Gandhi should indicate precisely the points to which he objected and the report could then be altered, if possible, to meet the views of everybody.
('16', 32, 2, 11, 74885) Mr. Rainy pointed out that if there was anything in Chapter II which was contentious, it could be transferred to the contentious part of the report.
('16', 32, 2, 12, 75034) He added that if the report was to recommend the tribunal, it was unnecessary to discuss the sharahbeshi question at length, because that was the very point which the tribunal
('16', 32, 3, 13, 75210) would have to decide, but if Government was going to decide the question itself, then it would be necessary to give the arguments at some length.
('16', 32, 3, 14, 75356) Mr. Gandhi thought that Government would have to decide between the views of the majority and his own views, as what he wanted was for Government to decide on the equities of the case and legislate at once.
('16', 32, 3, 15, 75563) If Government held sharahbeshi to be illegal and that tinkathia,
('16', 32, 4, 16, 75628) though legal, was accompanied by so much abuse that it should be abolished, they would legislate against it without the necessity of appointing a tribunal.
('16', 32, 4, 17, 75784) If he had come on the scene earlier, he would have advised the raiyats against compensation,
('16', 32, 5, 18, 75877) but as it was, compensation had been paid and he had to recognise that Mr. Reid said that he had only agreed to recommend that tinkathia should be abolished if there was
('16', 32, 6, 19, 76047) compensation for it.
('16', 32, 6, 20, 76068) The President said that the Committee could not bind Government, but he could indicate the view that he thought Government took; if there was a decision by arbitration on the consent of both parties, Government could legislate to give effect to that agreement without any difficulty.
('16', 32, 6, 21, 76352) If there was no agreement, there were two alternatives:
('16', 32, 7, 22, 76408) (1) for Government to decide for itself and legislate accordingly or
('16', 32, 8, 23, 76477) (2) for the matter to be referred to a special tribunal or left to the ordinary courts.
('16', 32, 9, 24, 76565) As to the first alternative, questions affecting important claims to property were involved which it would be rather arbitrary and high handed for Government to decide executively.
('16', 32, 9, 25, 76746) The second alternative would, therefore, be the one probably adopted if no agreements were reached.
('16', 32, 9, 26, 76846) The President added that until the Committee had before them Mr. Gandhi’s specific suggestions as to what he wished to alter in the report, it was impossible to go on.
('16', 32, 9, 27, 77014) What he wanted was a unanimous report as far as possible, that is to say, that any contentious matter should be confined to the one portion regarding sharahbeshi.
('16', 32, 9, 28, 77177) Mr. Gandhi said that there was one master idea
('16', 33, 0, 1, 77224) 34 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 33, 1, 2, 77265) running through the report recognising the legality in certain cases of the tinkathia obligation and the justification for sharahbeshi.
('16', 33, 1, 3, 77401) The President said that if Mr. Gandhi
('16', 33, 2, 4, 77439) would go through the report in detail, each portion of it could be dealt with separately.
('16', 33, 3, 5, 77529) Discussing the possibility of arbitration, Mr. Gandhi said that he thought if the planters believed they had a good case, it was unbusinesslike for them to refuse arbitration.
('16', 33, 3, 6, 77705) The President asked whether if only Mr. Norman agreed to arbitration, it was worthwhile taking up his case alone.
('16', 33, 3, 7, 77819) Mr. Rainy thought that might make one or other of the parties regard the local Government as being incapacitated from dealing with the other cases impartially.
('16', 33, 3, 8, 77979) He suggested that if a special tribunal was set up, it might be left open to the planters to agree to arbitration by the tribunal instead of detailed trial in each case.
('16', 33, 3, 9, 78149) The President said he did not think there would be any advantage in that.
('16', 33, 4, 10, 78223) The President then suggested that the constitution ant duties of the tribunal should be discussed.
('16', 33, 4, 11, 78322) Mr. Adami said that it should consist of three members to provide for a difference of opinion and thought that there should be an appeal to the High Court on any legal point but not on the question of what was the fair amount for the commutation of the obligation.
('16', 33, 4, 12, 78587) The Committee accepted three as the number of members of the tribunal and the personnel was then discussed.
('16', 33, 4, 13, 78695) The President suggested that the tribunal should consist of:
('16', 33, 5, 14, 78756) (1) a Judicial Officer not below the rank of District Judge,
('16', 33, 6, 15, 78817) (2) a Revenue Officer not below the rank of Collector, and
('16', 33, 7, 16, 78876) (3) another Judge or another Revenue Officer.
('16', 33, 8, 17, 78922) As to (1), Mr. Rainy proposed that the Judicial Officer should be a High Court Judge and that there should be no appeal.
('16', 33, 8, 18, 79043) Mr. Gandhi, however, thought that there should be a right of appeal, as tribunals sometimes went wrong.
('16', 33, 8, 19, 79147) His view was the same whether the Judicial Officer in the tribunal was a High Court Judge or a District Judge.
('16', 33, 8, 20, 79258) He agreed that the right of appeal should be confined to legal points.
('16', 33, 8, 21, 79329) Mr. Adami said that if a High Court Judge was on the tribunal, he would allow no appeal, but there was no technical objection to an appeal being allowed from such a tribunal.
('16', 33, 8, 22, 79504) Mr. Reid agreed with Mr. Rainy.
('16', 33, 8, 23, 79536) Raja Kirtyanand Singh said that he would prefer that Mr. Gandhi should agree to a 25 per cent reduction in sharahbeshi, which would
('16', 33, 9, 24, 79668) obviate the appointment of a tribunal, the working of which would obviously give a good deal of trouble.
('16', 33, 9, 25, 79773) The Committee agreed that the second member of the tribunal should be a Revenue Officer not below the grade of Collector.
('16', 33, 9, 26, 79895) As to the third member of the tribunal, Mr. Rainy said he would prefer to leave it to the local Government, who might wish to appoint neither a Judge nor a Revenue Officer.
('16', 33, 9, 27, 80068) Mr. Adami said that he would prefer the third member to be a Judicial Officer.
('16', 33, 9, 28, 80147) Mr. Gandhi also preferred a
('16', 34, 0, 1, 80175) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 35
('16', 34, 1, 2, 80220) Judicial Officer.
('16', 34, 1, 3, 80238) He said that the case here was not the same as in arbitration and, for a formal judicial tribunal, he would prefer a majority of Judicial Officers.
('16', 34, 1, 4, 80386) The President asked if it was possible for a High Court Judge and a District Judge to sit together.
('16', 34, 1, 5, 80486) Mr. Adami said he thought there was no objection, Mr. Rainy said that Government might wish to put in a barrister or a pleader, and might also desire that one at least of the tribunal should be an Indian.
('16', 34, 1, 6, 80691) He thought if they made their recommendation as to the personnel in too much detail, it would tie the hands of Government.
('16', 34, 1, 7, 80814) The President then raised a question of the duties of tribunal.
('16', 34, 1, 8, 80878) He suggested that the necessary legislation should lay down their duties somewhat as follows:
('16', 34, 2, 9, 80972) That on the application of either party within a certain period, the tribunal was to decide (1) If the obligation to grow indigo existed or not.
('16', 34, 2, 10, 81117) (2) If so, what compensation in the form of enhanced rent, if any, should be allowed.
('16', 34, 2, 11, 81203) (3) If the tribunal decided that compensation was to be given, it should have regard in fixing that compensation to the following points:
('16', 34, 3, 12, 81341) (a) in no case was the rent to be greater than fair and equitable rent;
('16', 34, 4, 13, 81413) (b) the existing rent and the period for which it had remained unenhanced; and
('16', 34, 5, 14, 81492) (c) the actual rate of sharahbeshi which had been taken in the concern or in
('16', 34, 6, 15, 81569) neighbouring concerns.
('16', 34, 7, 16, 81592) Mr. Adami said that if the tribunal had to fix a commutation rate, this was probably the best way.
('16', 34, 7, 17, 81691) It had been suggested that a fair and equitable rent should be fixed by the tribunal, irrespective of any conditions.
('16', 34, 7, 18, 81809) Mr. Rainy said that in his view the tribunal should be left entirely free to decide what points to consider.
('16', 34, 7, 19, 81918) There were limits to their discretion because they could not fix the rent lower than the original rent nor one higher than the existing rent including sharahbeshi.
('16', 34, 7, 20, 82082) The President said
('16', 34, 8, 21, 82101) that as Revenue Officer, he would hesitate to carry out the rent settlement without some such guidance as he had proposed.
('16', 34, 8, 22, 82224) Mr. Reid pointed out that the survey record was available and would assist the tribunal.
('16', 34, 8, 23, 82313) The President said that the survey record was not designed for what in northern India was understood by the settlement of rent; and in his view the proposal would lengthen the proceedings considerably.
('16', 34, 8, 24, 82515) Mr. Rainy did not press his view but he thought that the decision as to what points should be considered should be left to the tribunal.
('16', 34, 8, 25, 82652) The President said this might be met if it was laid down that, amongst other considerations, the tribunal should take into account the three points mentioned.
('16', 34, 8, 26, 82811) Mr. Gandhi pointed out that any recommendation restricting the provisions of the Bengal Tenancy Act would be fought in the Legislative Council, and that as far as possible the Committee’s suggestion should aim at liberalising the Act and not restricting it.
('16', 34, 8, 27, 83069) Mr. Reid said he thought it would be simpler if the tribunal was simply given power to consider
('16', 35, 0, 1, 83165) 36 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 35, 1, 2, 83206) the rent rendered at the settlement and revise it, if necessary.
('16', 35, 1, 3, 83271) The President pointed out that the special tribunal would only have to consider cases where the obligation had been recorded or where sharahbeshi had been taken.
('16', 35, 1, 4, 83433) It was agreed that the period
('16', 35, 2, 5, 83463) of time within which applications to the tribunal should be made should be fixed at three months from the date of notification, and that if application was not made within that period, the entry in the settlement record should be final.
('16', 35, 2, 6, 83700) Mr. Adami was asked to draft a paragraph embodying these decisions to go at the end of paragraph 24 of the report.
('16', 35, 3, 7, 83815) Mr. Gandhi wanted provisions to be made that the tribunal should consider cases of coercion and undue influence and other illegal practices, that is to say, that it should go into the past history of the working of the tinkathia system.
('16', 35, 3, 8, 84052) Mr. Adami
('16', 35, 4, 9, 84062) said that this would take a long time.
('16', 35, 4, 10, 84101) Mr. Gandhi pointed out that there would be a test case which other cases would follow.
('16', 35, 4, 11, 84188) The President said he thought that the clause, that the tribunal could decide what compensation, if any, was payable, implied that the raiyat in his plea would be able to plead that no compensation was due, because in
('16', 35, 5, 12, 84406) the past the planter had already got sufficient compensation.
('16', 35, 5, 13, 84468) He thought that Mr. Gandhi by this request was going back to his original case that there should be no tribunal.
('16', 35, 5, 14, 84581) Whether there was to be a tribunal or not, there was a point that Government would have to decide.
('16', 35, 5, 15, 84680) Mr. Rainy said that if the tribunal was to consider all these matters, it might be simpler to leave the whole thing to the operation of the ordinary law and merely appoint a Special Judge to try the cases.
('16', 35, 5, 16, 84886) Mr. Gandhi said that even if Government found that the equities were in favour of the case, they would appoint a tribunal because as the President had said before, they could not take on themselves the responsibility of passing an arbitrary executive order.
('16', 35, 5, 17, 85144) Mr. Adami said that he thought the widest discretion should be given to the tribunal.
('16', 35, 5, 18, 85230) Mr. Rainy pointed out that the Turkaulia case had been fought largely on the point of coercion and that this might be raised in sharahbeshi cases that came before the tribunal.
('16', 35, 5, 19, 85407) The tribunal, however, was also to deal with cases where sharahbeshi had not been taken, but
('16', 35, 6, 20, 85500) where applications had been made for the obligation to be commuted.
('16', 35, 6, 21, 85568) If the tribunal allowed an enhancement of rent in the latter case, why should they not do so in the former case even when the agreement was void on account of coercion?
('16', 35, 6, 22, 85737) He did not consider, therefore, that the question of coercion came in to any great extent.
('16', 35, 6, 23, 85828) It was to provide for cases of this sort that he proposed that the tribunal should consider anything that they thought relevant.
('16', 35, 6, 24, 85957) Mr. Reid enquired as to who would pay the cost of the tribunal.
('16', 35, 6, 25, 86021) The President said presumably Government would pay the cost and enquired of Mr. Gandhi if he could say how long the tribunal would take.
('16', 35, 6, 26, 86158) Mr. Gandhi said he thought it would take at least a month in the most favourable circumstances.
('16', 35, 6, 27, 86254) Mr. Adami thought it would take much longer.
('16', 35, 7, 28, 86299) As regards the printed evidence, Mr. Gandhi said that he wanted the enclosures
('16', 36, 0, 1, 86378) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 37
('16', 36, 1, 2, 86423) to the written evidence of the three raiyats who had been examined publicly to be
('16', 36, 2, 3, 86505) printed.
('16', 36, 2, 4, 86514) The President said that these could be printed as an appendix.
('16', 36, 2, 5, 86577) Mr. Gandhi also wanted statements of other raiyats that he had filed to be printed.
('16', 36, 2, 6, 86661) Mr. Reid
('16', 36, 3, 7, 86670) objected to this.
('16', 36, 3, 8, 86688) The President said that it would be sufficient for Mr. Gandhi’s purpose if statements of witnesses who were examined informally were printed.
('16', 36, 3, 9, 86830) Mr. Gandhi said that he would examine the statements and consider the point.
('16', 36, 3, 10, 86907) He also wanted copies of judgements that he had filed to be printed.
('16', 36, 3, 11, 86976) The President said that that would make a very bulky record.
('16', 36, 3, 12, 87037) The judgements were all public documents and he did not think it more necessary to print them than it was to print Government records that had been placed before them.
('16', 36, 3, 13, 87205) Mr. Gandhi said he thought that Mr. Gourlay’s report should be printed.
('16', 36, 3, 14, 87277) The President said that was a matter for the Government to decide.
('16', 36, 3, 15, 87344) Mr. Gandhi said his idea in wanting these documents printed was that he could refer to them in his report.
('16', 36, 3, 16, 87451) The President pointed out that Mr. Gandhi could refer to them, although they were not printed.
('16', 36, 4, 17, 87546) The meeting then adjourned.

('16', 36, 8, 20, 87709) RANCHI, September 25, 1917
('16', 36, 9, 21, 87736) TO THE EDITOR THE LEADER
('16', 36, 10, 22, 87761) SIR, I have now been in India for over two years and a half after my return from South Africa.
('16', 36, 10, 23, 87856) Over one quarter of that time I have passed on the Indian trains travelling 3rd class by choice.
('16', 36, 10, 24, 87953) I have travelled north as far as Lahore, down south up to Tranquebar, and from Karachi to Calcutta.
('16', 36, 10, 25, 88053) Having resorted to third class travelling among other reasons for the purpose of studying the conditions under which this class of passengers travel, I have naturally made as critical observations as I could.
('16', 36, 10, 26, 88262) I have fairly covered the majority of railway systems during this period.
('16', 36, 10, 27, 88336) Now and then I have entered into
('16', 36, 11, 28, 88369) 1 A copy of this was sent by Gandhiji to the Secretary, Department of Commerce and Industries, Delhi, with a letter making practical suggestions for improvement; vide, “Letter to Commerce and Industries Secretary”, 31 10 1917.
('16', 37, 0, 1, 88596) 38 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 37, 1, 2, 88637) correspondence with the management of the different railways about defects that have come under my notice.
('16', 37, 1, 3, 88744) But I think that the time has come when I should invite the Press and the public to join in a crusade against a grievance which has too long remained unredressed, though much of it is capable of redress without great difficulty.
('16', 37, 1, 4, 88973) On the 12th instant I booked at Bombay for Madras by the mail train and paid Rs. 13 9. It was labelled to carry 22 passengers.
('16', 37, 1, 5, 89100) These could only have seating accommodation.
('16', 37, 1, 6, 89145) There were no bunks in this carriage whereon passengers could lie with any degree of safety or comfort.
('16', 37, 1, 7, 89249) There were two nights to be passed in this train before reaching Madras.
('16', 37, 1, 8, 89322) If not more than 22 passengers found their way into my carriage before we reached Poona, it was because the bolder ones kept the others at bay.
('16', 37, 1, 9, 89466) With the exception of two or three insistent passengers, all had to find their sleep, being seated all the time.
('16', 37, 1, 10, 89579) After reaching Raichur the pressure became unbearable.
('16', 37, 1, 11, 89634) The rush of passengers could not be stayed.
('16', 37, 1, 12, 89678) The fighters among us found the task almost beyond them.
('16', 37, 1, 13, 89735) The guards or other railway servants came in only to push in more passengers.
('16', 37, 1, 14, 89813) A defiant Memon merchant protested against this packing of passengers like sardines.
('16', 37, 1, 15, 89898) In vain did he say that this was his fifth night on the train.
('16', 37, 1, 16, 89961) The guard insulted him and referred him to the management at the terminus.
('16', 37, 1, 17, 90036) There were during this night as many as 35 passengers in the carriage during the greater part of it.
('16', 37, 1, 18, 90137) Some lay on the floor in the midst of dirt and some had to keep standing.
('16', 37, 1, 19, 90211) A free fight was at one time avoided only by the intervention of some of the older passengers who did not want to add to the discomfort by an exhibition of temper.
('16', 37, 1, 20, 90375) On the way, passengers got for tea tannin water with filthy sugar and a whitish looking liquid miscalled milk which gave this water a muddy appearance.
('16', 37, 1, 21, 90527) I can vouch for the appearance, but I cite the testimony of the passengers as to the taste.
('16', 37, 1, 22, 90619) Not during the whole of the journey was the compartment once swept or cleaned.
('16', 37, 1, 23, 90698) The result was every time you walked on the floor or rather cut your way through the passengers seated on the floor, you waded through dirt.
('16', 37, 1, 24, 90839) The closet was also not cleaned during the journey and there was no water in the water tank.
('16', 37, 1, 25, 90932) Refreshments sold to the passengers were dirty looking, handed by dirtier hands, coming out of filthy receptacles and weighed in
('16', 38, 0, 1, 91061) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 39
('16', 38, 1, 2, 91106) equally unattractive scales.
('16', 38, 1, 3, 91135) These were previously sampled by millions of flies.
('16', 38, 1, 4, 91187) I asked some of the passengers who went in for these dainties to give their opinion.
('16', 38, 1, 5, 91272) Many of them used choice expressions as to the quality but were satisfied to state that they were helpless in the matter; they had to take things as they came.
('16', 38, 2, 6, 91432) On reaching the station, I found that the ghariwala 1 would not take me unless I paid the fare he wanted.
('16', 38, 2, 7, 91538) I mildly protested and told him I would pay him the authorized fare.
('16', 38, 2, 8, 91607) I had to turn passive resister before I could be taken.
('16', 38, 2, 9, 91663) I simply told him he would have to pull me out of the ghari or call the policeman.
('16', 38, 3, 10, 91746) The return journey was performed in no better manner.
('16', 38, 3, 11, 91800) The carriage was packed already and but for a friend’s intervention, I could not have been able to secure even a seat.
('16', 38, 3, 12, 91919) My admission was certainly beyond the authorized number.
('16', 38, 3, 13, 91976) This compartment was constructed to carry 9 passengers but it had constantly 12 in it.
('16', 38, 3, 14, 92063) At one place, an important railway servant swore at a protestant, threatened to strike him and locked the door over the passengers whom he had with difficulty squeezed in.
('16', 38, 3, 15, 92235) To this compartment there was a closet falsely so called.
('16', 38, 3, 16, 92293) It was designed as a European closet but could hardly be used as such.
('16', 38, 3, 17, 92364) There was a pipe in it but no water, and I say without fear of challenge that it was pestilentially dirty.
('16', 38, 4, 18, 92471) The compartment itself was evil looking.
('16', 38, 4, 19, 92512) Dirt was lying thick upon the wood work and I do not know that it had ever seen soap or water.
('16', 38, 5, 20, 92607) The compartment had an exceptional assortment of passengers.
('16', 38, 5, 21, 92668) There were stalwart Punjabi Mahommedans, two refined Tamilians and two Mahommedan merchants who joined us later.
('16', 38, 5, 22, 92781) The merchants related [about] the bribes they had to give to procure comfort.
('16', 38, 5, 23, 92859) One of the Punjabis had already travelled three nights and was weary and fatigued.
('16', 38, 5, 24, 92942) But he could not stretch himself.
('16', 38, 5, 25, 92976) He said he had sat the whole day at the Central Station, watching passengers giving bribes to procure their tickets.
('16', 38, 5, 26, 93093) Another said he had himself to pay Rs. 5 before he could get his ticket and his seat.
('16', 38, 5, 27, 93179) These three men were bound for Ludhiana and had still more nights of travel in store for them.
('16', 38, 6, 28, 93274) What I have described is not exceptional but normal.
('16', 38, 6, 29, 93327) I have got down at Raichur, Dhond, Sonepur, Chakardharpur, Purulia, Asansol
('16', 38, 7, 30, 93403) 1 Driver of the carriage
('16', 39, 0, 1, 93428) 40 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 39, 1, 2, 93469) and other junction stations and been at the Mosafirkhana 1 attached to these stations.
('16', 39, 1, 3, 93556) They are discreditable looking places where there is no order, no cleanliness but utter confusion and horrible din and noise.
('16', 39, 1, 4, 93682) Passengers have no benches or not enough to sit on.
('16', 39, 1, 5, 93734) They squat on dirty floors and eat dirty food.
('16', 39, 1, 6, 93781) They are permitted to throw the leavings of their food and spit where they like, sit how they like, and smoke everywhere.
('16', 39, 1, 7, 93903) The closets attached to these places defy description.
('16', 39, 1, 8, 93958) I have not the power to adequately describe them without committing a breach of the laws of decent speech.
('16', 39, 1, 9, 94065) Disinfecting powder, ashes or disinfecting fluids are unknown.
('16', 39, 1, 10, 94128) The army of flies buzzing about them warns you against their use.
('16', 39, 1, 11, 94194) But a third class traveller is dumb and helpless.
('16', 39, 1, 12, 94244) He does not want to complain even though to go to these places may be to court death.
('16', 39, 1, 13, 94330) I know passengers who fast while they are travelling just in order to lessen the misery of their life in the trains.
('16', 39, 1, 14, 94447) At Sonepur flies having failed, wasps have come forth to warn the public and the authorities, but yet to no purpose.
('16', 39, 1, 15, 94564) At the Imperial Capital a certain 3rd class booking office is a Black Hole fit only to be destroyed.
('16', 39, 2, 16, 94665) Is it any wonder that plague has become endemic in India?
('16', 39, 2, 17, 94723) Any other result is impossible where passengers always leave some dirt where they go and take more on leaving.
('16', 39, 3, 18, 94834) On Indian trains alone passengers smoke with impunity in all carriages irrespective of the presence of the fair sex and irrespective of the protest of non smokers.
('16', 39, 3, 19, 94998) And this notwithstanding a bye law which prevents a passenger from smoking without the permission of his fellows in a compartment which is not allotted to smokers.
('16', 39, 4, 20, 95162) The existence of the awful war cannot be allowed to stand in the way of removal of this gigantic evil.
('16', 39, 4, 21, 95265) War can be no warrant for tolerating dirt and overcrowding.
('16', 39, 4, 22, 95325) One could understand an entire stoppage of passenger traffic in a crisis like this, but never a continuation or accentuation of insanitation and conditions that must undermine health and morality.
('16', 39, 4, 23, 95522) Compare the lot of the 1st class passengers with that of the 3rd class.
('16', 39, 4, 24, 95594) In the Madras case, the 1st class fare is over five times as much as the 3rd class fare.
('16', 39, 4, 25, 95683) Does the third class passenger get one fifth, even one tenth, of the comforts of his first class fellow?
('16', 39, 4, 26, 95788) It is but simple justice to claim that some relative proportion be observed between the cost and comfort.
('16', 39, 5, 27, 95894) 1 Passengers’ waiting rooms
('16', 40, 0, 1, 95922) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 41
('16', 40, 1, 2, 95967) It is a known fact that the 3rd class traffic pays for the ever increasing luxuries of 1st and 2nd class travelling.
('16', 40, 1, 3, 96084) Surely a third class passenger is entitled at least to the bare necessities of life.
('16', 40, 2, 4, 96169) In neglecting the 3rd class passengers, opportunity of giving a splendid education to millions in orderliness, sanitation, decent composite life, and cultivation of simple and clean tastes is being lost.
('16', 40, 2, 5, 96373) Instead of receiving an object lesson in these matters, 3rd class passengers have their sense of decency and cleanliness blunted during their travelling experience.
('16', 40, 3, 6, 96538) Among the many suggestions that can be made for dealing with the evil here described, I would respectfully include this: Let the people in high places, the Viceroy, the Commander in chief, the Rajas, Maharajas, the Imperial Councillors and others, who gene rally travel in superior classes, without previous warning, go through the experiences now and then of 3rd class travelling.
('16', 40, 3, 7, 96920) We would then soon see a remarkable change in the conditions of the 3rd class travelling and the uncomplaining millions will get some return for the fares they pay under the expectation of being carried from place to place with the ordinary creature comforts.

('16', 41, 3, 7, 97526) He appears worthy of being taken up.
('16', 41, 3, 8, 97563) I have asked for some more information from him.

('16', 41, 9, 22, 98060) I don’t take any medicine, though.
('16', 41, 9, 23, 98095) I am confident that I shall get rid of it.
('16', 41, 9, 24, 98138) There is no need to worry about me.
('16', 41, 9, 25, 98174) Tell Narahari that Prof.
('16', 41, 9, 26, 98199) Balvantrai 3 has undertaken to write the preface to Gokhale’s speeches.
('16', 41, 9, 27, 98271) I know you must be having no end of difficulties.
('16', 41, 9, 28, 98321) There can be no great achievement without difficulties.
('16', 41, 10, 29, 98377) 1 Gandhiji was in Ranchi on this date.
('16', 41, 10, 30, 98416) The original has Bhadrapad Shukla 9, which appears to be a slip for Adhik Ashvin Shukla 9, for on the former date Gandhiji was not in Ranchi.

('16', 42, 6, 13, 99620) RANCHI, September 26, 1917
('16', 42, 7, 14, 99647) The President said he had a talk with Mr. Hill on the previous day but found him obdurate.
('16', 42, 7, 15, 99738) Mr. Hill told him that he was certain that Mr. Irwin would not accept arbitration but probably Mr. Norman would.
('16', 42, 7, 16, 99851) Mr. Hill also said that he was sorry he had made any offer of reduction and would prefer to have the matter settled by a court.
('16', 42, 7, 17, 99979) It was not only a matter of money but of reputation.
('16', 42, 7, 18, 100032) The President thought that, in these circumstances, any idea of arbitration must be dropped, but the question arose as to whether it was worthwhile going on with arbitration in Mr. Norman’s case.
('16', 42, 7, 19, 100228) The difficulty was that two methods of settlement would be going on at the same time and two kinds of legislation would be necessary.
('16', 42, 7, 20, 100362) Mr. Rainy pointed out that it was open to Mr. Norman to have his case arbitrated separately apart from any recommendation of the Committee and he might be contented to do so without binding legislation.
('16', 42, 7, 21, 100565) Mr. Gandhi said that in Mr. Norman’s case, there would be no difficulty in giving effect to a settlement in his concern by consent.
('16', 42, 7, 22, 100697) The agreements could be registered village by village.
('16', 42, 7, 23, 100752) The President observed that it would be difficult to legislate for one concern only.
('16', 42, 7, 24, 100837) Mr. Adami said that this would not be necessary.
('16', 42, 7, 25, 100886) The legislation could be on the lines that either the parties could apply to the tribunal for settlement of rent or could go to arbitration, in which case it could be provided that the award should be given effect to by the tribunal.
('16', 42, 7, 26, 101120) There would be no need in this case to specify any particular concern in the legislation.
('16', 42, 7, 27, 101210) Mr. Gandhi said that it was doubtful
('16', 42, 8, 28, 101247) 1 This is not available.
('16', 43, 0, 1, 101272) 44 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 43, 1, 2, 101313) whether anything could be generally done by consent.
('16', 43, 1, 3, 101366) Treating the matter now as a difference between himself and the rest of the Committee, he asked whether the difference could be split and adopted as a recommendation of the Committee.
('16', 43, 1, 4, 101550) The President said that when this matter was discussed before, his view was that there was no case for the planters to give up sharahbeshi at all.
('16', 43, 1, 5, 101697) They had, however, volunteered
('16', 43, 2, 6, 101728) to give up a certain percentage for the sake of a settlement by goodwill and he was not prepared to recommend Government to go any further without the consent of the planters.
('16', 43, 2, 7, 101904) Mr. Reid also said that he could not agree to anything beyond the limits already indicated.
('16', 43, 2, 8, 101996) The President said that there was no chance of settlement by consent unless Mr. Gandhi could bring h imself to agree to these limits.
('16', 43, 2, 9, 102130) Mr. Reid asked if there was any chance of agreement on a proposal to start at a reduction of 40 per cent and after a period of years to work up to a reduction of 25 per cent.
('16', 43, 2, 10, 102305) The President said that he thought the planters would not accept that.
('16', 43, 2, 11, 102376) He added that he gathered that although Mr. Irwin would abide by his promise, he would be glad if he saw any way out of it.
('16', 43, 2, 12, 102500) He asked Mr. Gandhi whether it was more in the interests of raiyats to accept the planters’ limits or to leave them to fight it out.
('16', 43, 2, 13, 102633) He thought that
('16', 43, 3, 14, 102649) the risks of failure, if they were left to fight, were so great, that it was not worth it.
('16', 43, 3, 15, 102740) Mr. Gandhi said that he did not see the risk because he had every confidence that he would prove his case.
('16', 43, 3, 16, 102847) The President asked what that confidence was based on, because Mr. Gandhi had been able to put his case before four members of the Committee and had failed to convince them.
('16', 43, 3, 17, 103021) Two of the Government witnesses, Mr. Sweeney and Mr. Heycock, were certainly not unsympathetic to the raiyats and they were convinced
('16', 43, 4, 18, 103155) that Mr. Gandhi’s view of the case was wrong.
('16', 43, 4, 19, 103201) The legal view, so far as it had been expressed, was also contrary to Mr. Gandhi’s.
('16', 43, 4, 20, 103285) Mr. Gandhi said that this was not the case.
('16', 43, 4, 21, 103329) He held that the Turkaulia judgement was in his favour because kabuliyats 1 could
('16', 43, 5, 22, 103411) not be produced except in a few of the cases.
('16', 43, 5, 23, 103457) The President said that Mr. Hill had told him that, as far as Turkaulia was concerned, he was risking nothing, as registered kabuliyats existed in the large majority of cases.
('16', 43, 5, 24, 103633) Mr. Hill had also told him that he
('16', 43, 6, 25, 103668) had taken the very best legal advice which was to the effect that he was almost certain to win his case.
('16', 43, 6, 26, 103773) Mr. Gandhi said that on the raiyats’ side, there was great confidence
('16', 43, 7, 27, 103843) also but he did not base his view entirely on that.
('16', 43, 7, 28, 103895) He based his confidence on the equities of the case.
('16', 43, 7, 29, 103948) He thought that Mr. Sweeney’s views were unfortunately wrong and that his subsequent views were affected by the fact that he had to adhere to his decision.
('16', 43, 7, 30, 104104) The President said that Mr. Hill held that public discussion had impugned his reputation and for this reason he would welcome the tribunal so as to be given an opportunity for clearing himself.
('16', 43, 7, 31, 104298) Mr. Gandhi said that in that case, it would probably be necessary to have the tribunal, and an additional reason for this was supplied by the fact that Mr. Irwin felt sorry for his promise, because even if there was a
('16', 43, 8, 32, 104516) 1 Agreements (to pay rent)
('16', 44, 0, 1, 104543) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 45
('16', 44, 1, 2, 104588) settlement on the basis of this promise, there would be a certain amount of dissatisfaction and this was what he wanted to avoid.
('16', 44, 1, 3, 104718) The President said he did not think that the position in respect of Mr. Irwin’s promise had been quite understood.
('16', 44, 1, 4, 104833) The planters had agreed to a reduction not because they thought that their full claim was wrong but because they were willing to give up something in order to get a settlement by consent, and in deference to the wishes of the Committee.
('16', 44, 1, 5, 105070) There was, therefore, no reason to suppose that any settlement on these terms would be regarded with dissatisfaction.
('16', 44, 1, 6, 105188) Mr. Gandhi then suggested that he should go and see Mr. Hill, so that he could make his position clear and find out what was in Mr. Hill’s mind.
('16', 44, 1, 7, 105333) The President said that he understood that if Mr. Gandhi was satisfied with the justness of Mr. Hill’s attitude, he would agree to his terms.
('16', 44, 1, 8, 105475) Mr. Gandhi said that this was not what he meant.
('16', 44, 1, 9, 105524) What he intended was to try and persuade Mr. Hill to agree to arbitration.
('16', 44, 1, 10, 105599) If he failed and he saw that Mr. Hill had good reasons, he should have to reconsider his position regarding the previous non acceptance of the planters’ offer.
('16', 44, 1, 11, 105759) The President said that Mr. Hill had told him that he could not agree either to the arbitrator proposed by the Committee or to the arbitration being between the limits of 20 and 40 per cent, but that he would accept as an arbitrator a European Judge of the Patna or the Calcutta High Court acquainted with the Tenancy Act or a commercial man.
('16', 44, 1, 12, 106102) Mr. Gandhi said that it had given him hope that an arbitration might be possible after all.
('16', 44, 1, 13, 106194) He asked whether Mr. Hill would disagree to have an arbitrator from Champaran, as it would be an advantage to have someone who knew the question.
('16', 44, 1, 14, 106340) He had previously 1 suggested a tribunal composed of Mr. Apperley and Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya with Mr. Heycock as President; and he would be inclined to accept Mr. Heycock as an arbitrator, if the other side agreed.
('16', 44, 1, 15, 106560) Mr. Reid said he thought the planters would accept Mr. Heycock but the President was inclined to doubt if they would.
('16', 44, 1, 16, 106678) Mr. Gandhi said that if they accepted Mr. Heycock as an arbitrator, it would be understood that the arbitration should be between the figures already suggested.
('16', 44, 1, 17, 106839) Mr. Reid said he did not think that Mr. Hill would accept on that basis.
('16', 44, 1, 18, 106912) The President said that Mr. Hill’s view was that he, either right or wrong, was willing to give up of his own free will 20 per cent, but would not take the risk of being made to give up more by arbitration.
('16', 44, 1, 19, 107119) If it was put to him that if without prejudice he was prepared to offer more, it would be accepted and he might be inclined to agree to it.
('16', 44, 1, 20, 107259) He (Mr. Hill) was not prepared to accept what he regarded as a censure on his conduct except by a legally constituted tribunal.
('16', 44, 1, 21, 107387) It was not a matter of business but of conscience.
('16', 44, 1, 22, 107438) It was decided that the President and Mr. Reid should see Mr. Hill at once and that Mr. Reid and Mr. Gandhi should see him in the afternoon.
('16', 44, 1, 23, 107579) The President said he thought that if the interview was successful, that Managers of the other concerns, namely, Messrs

('16', 45, 1, 2, 107800) Norman, Irwin, Jameson and Bion 1 should be sent for.
('16', 45, 1, 3, 107854) He thought that if two concerns could be got to agree, the arbitration was worth doing, but if there was one only, it was not worthwhile to go on.
('16', 45, 1, 4, 108001) He asked whether, assuming Turkaulia and Pipra agreed to a settlement, the Committee were prepared to recommend that a similar settlement should be enforced by legislation on the other three concerns, although the proprietors did not agree.
('16', 45, 1, 5, 108242) The Committee agreed that this would be done.
('16', 45, 2, 6, 108288) Mr. Reid raised the question as to whether the abolition of tinkathia should
('16', 45, 3, 7, 108365) not be made compulsory.
('16', 45, 3, 8, 108389) Mr. Gandhi said he thought the Legislative Council would not accept this, but in all probability the raiyats would apply for commutation
('16', 45, 4, 9, 108526) voluntarily.
('16', 45, 4, 10, 108539) Mr. Reid said he doubted if all of them would apply and it would be inconvenient to have one or two raiyats with the tinkathia obligation still attached.
('16', 45, 5, 11, 108693) The President said that he understood that His Honour was in favour of having it abolished.
('16', 45, 5, 12, 108785) Mr. Gandhi said he saw legal difficulties but would be willing to accept the view that it should be abolished as a recommendation of the Committee.
('16', 45, 5, 13, 108933) The President pointed out that, on the one side, the raiyat was not to be allowed to enter into contract and it was reasonable, on the other side, that the raiyat should not be allowed to it even if he wanted it.
('16', 45, 5, 14, 109146) The raiyat was fully safeguarded because the tribunal
('16', 45, 6, 15, 109200) could not fix more than a fair rent.
('16', 45, 6, 16, 109237) He added that in Turkaulia, five per cent of the raiyats was still doing tinkathia which was one of the points on which Mr. Hill relied to prove his case.
('16', 45, 6, 17, 109392) Mr. Gandhi said that, when khushki indigo was grown on a large scale, as he hoped it would be, the raiyats, under the tinkathia obligation, would
('16', 45, 7, 18, 109538) soon find it to their advantage to commute.
('16', 45, 7, 19, 109582) Mr. Rainy pointed out that if the old system survived in any case, it might affect prejudicially the working of the new khushki system.
('16', 45, 7, 20, 109718) Mr. Gandhi said he would accept the recommendation as part of the
('16', 45, 8, 21, 109784) whole compromise but not if a tribunal was appointed.
('16', 45, 8, 22, 109838) In that case, the legislation would abolish the tinkathia obligation and leave the landlord the option of applying
('16', 45, 9, 23, 109953) for the settlement of additional rent as compensation if he wished.
('16', 45, 10, 24, 110021) The Committee then adjourned.

('16', 46, 3, 6, 110399) Mr. Natesan has provided him with a connected narrative of the movement of self government in a very attractive and acceptable form.
('16', 46, 3, 7, 110532) By reproducing in their historical sequence the extracts from official records, he has allowed them to speak for themselves.
('16', 46, 3, 8, 110657) The book is in my opinion a great help to the controversialist and the student of our present day politics who does not care to study musty blue books or has no access to them.
('16', 46, 3, 9, 110834) With reference to the joint scheme 3 of self Government, though I do not take so much interest in it as our leaders, I feel that from the Government stand point it must command their attention as a measure which has agitated the public mind as no other has, and I venture to think that there will be no peace in the country until the scheme has been accepted by the Government.

('16', 47, 1, 4, 112249) So much for the public eye.
('16', 47, 1, 5, 112277) Your decision to leave out ‘an appeal to the British Democracy’ is wise.
('16', 47, 1, 6, 112350) You will be sorry to learn that I have been laid up with fever since my arrival in Ranchi.
('16', 47, 1, 7, 112441) It comes on alternate days.
('16', 47, 1, 8, 112469) Yesterday was the fourth day.
('16', 47, 1, 9, 112499) It comes only in the afternoon.
('16', 47, 1, 10, 112531) It has therefore not interfered with the work in hand.
('16', 47, 1, 11, 112586) But it has weakened me very considerably.
('16', 47, 1, 12, 112628) The fear I have expressed in my letter 1 to the Press on the Railways has been realized in my own case.
('16', 47, 1, 13, 112732) I had no notion of it when I drafted the letter.
('16', 47, 1, 14, 112781) With regard to my speeches & writings 2 I wish you would not have the time limit.
('16', 47, 1, 15, 112863) I could then give you translations of some of my recent writings in Gujarati.
('16', 47, 1, 16, 112941) In my opinion they have considerable merit.
('16', 47, 1, 17, 112985) I would not have the required leisure before November when perhaps I would tackle the writing.
('16', 47, 1, 18, 113080) My fever need not cause you any worry.
('16', 47, 1, 19, 113119) It must take its time and go.

('16', 47, 6, 24, 113300) RANCHI, September 28, 1917
('16', 47, 7, 25, 113327) The discussion on Chapter IV of the report was taken up....
('16', 47, 7, 26, 113387) Mr. Gandhi said he did not like the arrangement of the Chapter.
('16', 47, 7, 27, 113451) He wanted to omit the first two paragraphs merely stating what abwab had been found to be collected, condemning
('16', 47, 8, 28, 113563) the practice and giving the Committee’s recommendations.
('16', 47, 9, 29, 113620) The arrangement for meeting Messrs Irwin and Norman was discussed.
('16', 47, 9, 30, 113687) It was settled that Mr. Reid should see them on Saturday and, if necessary, Mr. Gandhi

('16', 48, 1, 2, 114017) should see them on Sunday.
('16', 48, 1, 3, 114044) The next meeting was fixed for Monday morning.
('16', 48, 2, 4, 114091) Referring to the possibility of getting the goodwill of the planters in this settlement, the President asked Mr. Gandhi as to his future plans for Champaran.
('16', 48, 2, 5, 114249) Mr. Gandhi explained this to the Committee.
('16', 48, 2, 6, 114293) In the course of the discussion, Mr. Reid raised the question as to what would happen to the indigo crop in the coming year.
('16', 48, 2, 7, 114418) Mr. Gandhi said he would certainly advise the raiyats to grow indigo, provided a fair
('16', 48, 3, 8, 114504) price was paid for it.
('16', 48, 3, 9, 114527) Mr. Reid pointed out that the question of price was now raised for the first time.
('16', 48, 3, 10, 114610) The former decision of the Committee to which Mr. Gandhi had agreed was that indigo in the year 1917 18 should be grown on the old basis to allow the planters time to change the system.
('16', 48, 4, 11, 114796) Mr. Gandhi said that his view was that he was quite ready to advise the raiyats
('16', 48, 5, 12, 114876) to go on growing indigo but not on the old terms which were disadvantageous to the raiyat.
('16', 48, 5, 13, 114967) He would use his influence to get the raiyats to grow at a reasonable rate.
('16', 48, 6, 14, 115043) President asked whether it was possible to tide over this year, by the planters agreeing to pay a certain percentage above the Association rate.
('16', 48, 6, 15, 115188) Mr. Gandhi said he thought an agreement could be arrived at on those lines.
('16', 48, 6, 16, 115264) Mr. Reid said he could not accept the proposal until he had an opportunity of consulting the planters.
('16', 48, 7, 17, 115367) The Committee then adjourned.

('16', 48, 11, 23, 115583) I thought I could never fall ill.
('16', 48, 11, 24, 115617) Well I am laid up with malarial fever which comes on alternate days and in the afternoon.
('16', 48, 11, 25, 115707) This has not interfered with the work in hand.
('16', 48, 11, 26, 115754) I never knew, when I was penning my remarks on catching illness in that letter 1 of mine on the railway passengers (if you have read it at all) that I would be myself the illustration and that too immediately after the dispatch of that letter.
('16', 48, 11, 27, 115998) I am applying my own treatment.
('16', 48, 11, 28, 116030) You need not be anxious.
('16', 48, 11, 29, 116055) Possibly we shall meet in Allahabad.
('16', 48, 11, 30, 116092) I say possibly because I nay not have finished the Committee work here.

('16', 49, 1, 3, 116391) Yes, the Gujarat Sabha has selected workers.

('16', 49, 1, 5, 116491) The Home Rule League is working in Bombay.
('16', 49, 1, 6, 116534) And I have just received a letter from Mrs. Besant that her workers are doing likewise in Madras.
('16', 49, 1, 7, 116632) Elaborate instructions 1 have been drafted for the volunteers and the scheme has been fully translated for presentation to the villagers and others whose signatures are asked for.
('16', 49, 1, 8, 116812) The idea is that the whole of India should take up the petition which should be translated in the vernaculars.
('16', 49, 1, 9, 116923) The original draft was in Gujarati!
('16', 49, 1, 10, 116959) The English you have read is a translation.
('16', 49, 1, 11, 117003) For me the value of it lies in the education that the masses will receive and the opportunity that the educated men and women will have of coming in close touch with the people.
('16', 49, 1, 12, 117181) I do hope you are keeping well.

('16', 50, 4, 7, 118246) You will be glad to learn that some of the planters are anxious that I should go to Champaran at an early date and commence the work of pacification.
('16', 50, 4, 8, 118396) May I tell the ryots what the Committee has reported?
('16', 50, 4, 9, 118450) Your extreme goodness to me prompts me to make a request.
('16', 50, 4, 10, 118508) May I hope that the resolution will be worthy of the occasion and drawn up in no uncertain language?
('16', 50, 4, 11, 118609) The message to the ryots in the vernacular ought to be full and such as to reach their hearts.
('16', 50, 4, 12, 118704) If it is not impertinence on my part to say so, I would like to state that my services in this matter are at the disposal of the Government should they require them.
('16', 50, 4, 13, 118870) I shall be in Motihari on the 8th and shall be there till the 12th instant.
('16', 50, 4, 14, 118946) I have an engagement in Bhagalpur on the 15th instant and from that time forward, I shall not be free before the 7th Nov.
('16', 50, 4, 15, 119068) when I expect to return to Motihari.
('16', 50, 4, 16, 119105) I am leaving Ranchi today.

('16', 51, 8, 10, 119950) RANCHI, October 4, 1917
('16', 51, 9, 11, 119974) DEAR ESTHER, I have hot been able to write to you as often as I should like to have.
('16', 51, 9, 12, 120059) I must let you share one of the richest experiences of life.
('16', 51, 9, 13, 120120) Contrary to my expectation and owing to great strain, I was down with malaria, just when I could least afford to have illness.
('16', 51, 9, 14, 120247) I had to attend the Committee work every day.
('16', 51, 9, 15, 120293) Quinine was the drug prescribed.
('16', 51, 9, 16, 120326) I would not take it.
('16', 51, 9, 17, 120347) My faith has saved me.
('16', 51, 9, 18, 120370) I missed not a single meeting and we signed an unanimous report 4 yesterday.
('16', 51, 9, 19, 120447) I believe I have seen the last of the illness too.
('16', 51, 9, 20, 120498) I have not the time to go into greater detail but when we meet you should ask me to give you the details of this experience.
('16', 51, 9, 21, 120623) I take it you have read my letter to the Press on the railways.
('16', 51, 9, 22, 120687) 5 If you have missed it, you should ask the Ashram to let you have a copy.
('16', 51, 9, 23, 120762) You were quite right [in] not coming to Madras.
('16', 51, 9, 24, 120810) Love must be patient and humble.
('16', 51, 9, 25, 120843) It is the rich and leisurly who can afford to be demonstrative in their love.
('16', 51, 9, 26, 120921) We humble folks have naturally a different

('16', 52, 4, 10, 121667) I hope you got my telegram 3. I wanted to write immediately but could not.
('16', 52, 4, 11, 121742) And then I was on the move all the time and so could not write.
('16', 52, 4, 12, 121806) You have had to suffer much.
('16', 52, 4, 13, 121835) If you see matters in the right light, you will be the better for the suffering.
('16', 52, 4, 14, 121916) You lost your daughter, then your mother; now, India is all you have, call her daughter or mother, what you will.
('16', 52, 4, 15, 122030) You can get much from her and give her much.
('16', 52, 4, 16, 122075) You will receive a hundred times more than you give.
('16', 52, 4, 17, 122128) She is a Kamadhuk 4, but how can she yield milk if we don’t so much as feed her with hay?
('16', 52, 4, 18, 122218) What you may give and how, we shall consider when you are here.
('16', 52, 4, 19, 122282) If you agree to come over here, I am here up to the 20th at any rate.
('16', 52, 4, 20, 122352) After that, there will be some moving about.

('16', 53, 6, 7, 123346) [About October 9, 1917] 3
('16', 53, 7, 8, 123372) I am thankful to the Gaurakshini Sabha and to you all for inviting me to lay the foundation stone of the gaushala 4 in this town.
('16', 53, 7, 9, 123502) For the Hindus, this is sacred work.
('16', 53, 7, 10, 123539) Protection of the cow is a primary duty for every Indian.
('16', 53, 7, 11, 123597) It has been my experience, however, that the way we set about this important work leaves much to be desired.
('16', 53, 7, 12, 123706) I have given some thought to this serious problem and wish to place before you the conclusions I have formed.
('16', 53, 7, 13, 123816) These days cow protection has come to mean only two things: first, to save cows from the hands of our Muslim brethren on occasions like the Bakr i Id 5 and, secondly, to put up gaushalas for decrepit cows.
('16', 53, 7, 14, 124022) We do not go the right way to work for protecting the cows against our Muslim brethren.
('16', 53, 7, 15, 124110) The result has been that these two great communities of India are always at odds with each other and cherish mutual distrust.
('16', 53, 7, 16, 124236) Occasionally, they even fight.
('16', 53, 7, 17, 124267) The riot at Shahabad a few days ago bears out my statement.
('16', 53, 7, 18, 124327) The problem calls for some serious thinking on the part of both the communities.
('16', 53, 7, 19, 124408) Hundreds of Hindu friends indulged in rioting and looted the property of innocent Muslims.
('16', 53, 7, 20, 124499) What virtue could there be in this ?
('16', 53, 7, 21, 124536) In fact, it was a very sinful thing to do.
('16', 53, 7, 22, 124579) The activities of the Gaurakshini Sabha result in a far larger number of cows being killed than are saved.
('16', 53, 7, 23, 124686) Hinduism
('16', 53, 8, 24, 124695) 1 “Salutations to the motherland !” This had become a national slogan ever since Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s poem beginning with this phrase, in Anandmath, was adopted as a national song by the Indian National Congress.
('16', 53, 8, 25, 124915) 2 The meeting was held under the auspices of the Gaurakshini Sabha at Bettiah, a small town in the Champaran district of Bihar, about 25 miles from Motihari.
('16', 53, 8, 26, 125073) 3 The date is inferred from the reference, in the speech, to the communal riots in Shahabad, Bihar, which occurred between September 28 and October 9. 4 Institution for care of infirm and disabled cows 5 A Muslim festival
('16', 54, 0, 1, 125295) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 55
('16', 54, 1, 2, 125340) attaches special importance to non violence.
('16', 54, 1, 3, 125385) It is the very oppositeof religious conduct to kill a Muslim in order to save a cow.
('16', 54, 1, 4, 125470) If we wish the Muslims not to kill cows, we should bring about a change of heart in them.
('16', 54, 1, 5, 125560) We shall not succeed by force.
('16', 54, 1, 6, 125591) We should reach their hearts with prayer and entreaty and achieve our purpose by awakening their sense of compassion.
('16', 54, 1, 7, 125709) In adopting this course, we should take a pledge that, while seeking to protect the cows, weshall bear no ill will or malice towards Muslims or be angry with them or fight with them.
('16', 54, 1, 8, 125892) It is when we have taken up such a reassuring attitude that we shall be qualified to raise the matter with them.
('16', 54, 1, 9, 126005) It should be remembered that what we regard as sin is not seen in the same light by our Muslim brethren.
('16', 54, 1, 10, 126110) On the contrary, for them it is a meritorious act to kill cows on certain occasions.
('16', 54, 1, 11, 126195) Every person should follow his own religion.
('16', 54, 1, 12, 126240) If it were true that killing of cows was enjoined by Islam, India would have had no genuine peace any time; as I understand the matter, however, killing of cows on occasions like Bakr i Id is not obligatory, but Muslim friends imagine it their duty to do so when we seek to prevent them by force.
('16', 54, 1, 13, 126537) Be this as it may, I have no doubt in my mind that this problem can be solved only by tapascharya 1. The height of tapascharya on such occasions is to lay down one’s life for the sake of cows.
('16', 54, 1, 14, 126730) However, all Hindus are not qualified for such supreme tapascharya.
('16', 54, 1, 15, 126798) Those who want to stop others from sinning must be free from sin themselves.
('16', 54, 1, 16, 126875) Hindu society has been inflicting terrible cruelty on the cow and her progeny.
('16', 54, 1, 17, 126954) The present condition of our cows is a direct proof of this.
('16', 54, 1, 18, 127015) My heart bleeds when I see thousands of bullocks with no blood and flesh on them, their bones plainly visible beneath their skin, ill nourished and made to carry excessive burdens, while the driver twists their tails and goads them on.
('16', 54, 1, 19, 127251) I shudder when I see all this and ask myself how we can say anything to our Muslim friends so long as we do not refrain from such terrible violence.
('16', 54, 1, 20, 127400) We are so intensely selfish that we feel no shame in milking the cow to the last drop.
('16', 54, 1, 21, 127487) If you go to dairies in Calcutta, you will find that the calves there are forced to go without the mother’s milk and that all the milk is extracted with the help of a process known as blowing.
('16', 54, 1, 22, 127680) The proprietors and managers of these dairies are none other than Hindus and most of those who consume the milk are also Hindus.
('16', 54, 1, 23, 127809) So long as such dairies flourish and we consume the milk supplied by them, what
('16', 54, 2, 24, 127889) 1 Originally, constant meditation, such as by ancient sages, on the Supreme in search of enlightenment; here, persistent and painstaking endeavour
('16', 55, 0, 1, 128036) 56 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 55, 1, 2, 128077) right have we to argue with our Muslim brethren?
('16', 55, 1, 3, 128126) It should be borne in mind, besides, that there are slaughter houses.
('16', 55, 1, 4, 128196) in all the big cities of India.
('16', 55, 1, 5, 128228) Thousands of cows and bullocks are slaughtered in these.
('16', 55, 1, 6, 128285) It is mostly from them that beef is supplied to the British.
('16', 55, 1, 7, 128346) Hindu society keeps silent about this slaughter, thinking that it is helpless in the matter.
('16', 55, 1, 8, 128439) As long as we do not get this terrible slaughter stopped, I think it is impossible that we can produce any effect on the hearts of Muslims or protect the cows against them.
('16', 55, 1, 9, 128612) Our second task, therefore, is to carry on agitation among our British friends.
('16', 55, 1, 10, 128692) We are in no position to use brute strength against them.
('16', 55, 1, 11, 128750) They also should be won over by tapascharya and gentleness.
('16', 55, 1, 12, 128810) For them eating of beef is no religious act.
('16', 55, 1, 13, 128855) It should be easier to that extent to persuade them.
('16', 55, 1, 14, 128908) It is only after we have rid ourselves of the taint of violence which I mentioned earlier and have succeeded in persuading our British friends not to eat beef and kill cows and bullocks, it is only then that we shall be entitled to say something to our Muslim friends.
('16', 55, 1, 15, 129177) I can assure you that, when we have won over the British, our Muslim brethren will also have more sympathy for us and perform their religious rites with some other kind of offering.
('16', 55, 1, 16, 129359) Once we admit that we are also guilty of violence, the working of our gaushalas will change.
('16', 55, 1, 17, 129452) We shall not reserve them merely for decrepit cows but maintain there well nourished cows and bullocks as well.
('16', 55, 1, 18, 129564) We shall endeavour to improve the breed of cattle and will also be able to produce pure milk, ghee, etc.
('16', 55, 1, 19, 129669) This is not merely a religious issue.
('16', 55, 1, 20, 129707) It is an issue on which hinges the economic progress of India.
('16', 55, 1, 21, 129770) Economists have furnished irrefutable figures to prove that the quality of cattle in India is so poor that the income from their milk is much less than the cost of their maintenance.
('16', 55, 1, 22, 129953) We can turn our gaushalas into centres for the study of economics and for the solution of this big problem.
('16', 55, 1, 23, 130061) Gaushalas cost a great deal and at present we have to provide the expenses.
('16', 55, 1, 24, 130137) The gaushalas of my conception will become self supporting in future.
('16', 55, 1, 25, 130207) They will not be located in the midst of cities.
('16', 55, 1, 26, 130256) We may buy land in the neighbourhood of a city to the tune of hundreds of acres and locate these gaushalas there.
('16', 55, 1, 27, 130370) We can raise on this land crops to serve as fodder for the cows and every variety of grass.
('16', 55, 1, 28, 130462) We shall find good use for the valuable manure they yield by way of excrement and urine.
('16', 55, 1, 29, 130551) I hope you will all give the utmost thought to what I have said.
('16', 55, 1, 30, 130616) The Gaurakshini Sabha in Motihari has accepted this suggestion.
('16', 55, 1, 31, 130680) It is my request, in the end, that both these institutions come together and undertake this big task.

('16', 57, 1, 5, 132672) By inviting me to preside over this meeting today and permitting me to speak in Hindi and conduct the proceedings, too, in Hindi, you, students, have given me evidence of your love.
('16', 57, 1, 6, 132854) I shall think myself fortunate indeed if I can prove myself worthy of this love and be of some service to you.
('16', 57, 1, 7, 132965) You have shown great wisdom in deciding to carry on the proceedings of this Conference in the regional language of the province—which also happens to be our national language.
('16', 57, 1, 8, 133141) I congratulate you, and hope that you will continue this practice.
('16', 57, 2, 9, 133208) We have been guilty of disrespect to our mother tongue.
('16', 57, 2, 10, 133264) I am sure we shall have to pay heavily for this act of sin.
('16', 57, 2, 11, 133324) It has raised a wall of separation between us and our families.
('16', 57, 2, 12, 133388) All those who are present at this Conference will bear witness to this fact.
('16', 57, 2, 13, 133465) We do not and cannot explain to our mothers anything of what we learn.
('16', 57, 2, 14, 133536) We do not and cannot give the benefit of our knowledge to others in our families.
('16', 57, 2, 15, 133618) One will never find this sad state of affairs in an English family.
('16', 57, 2, 16, 133686) In England and in other countries where education is imparted through the mother tongue, students, when they return home, discuss with their parents what they learn at school; the servants in the home, and others too, become familiar with it.
('16', 57, 2, 17, 133929) Thus, the other members of the family also benefit from what the children learn at school.
('16', 57, 2, 18, 134020) We, on the other hand, leave behind in the school what we learn there.
('16', 57, 2, 19, 134091) Knowledge, like air, can circulate in no time.
('16', 57, 2, 20, 134138) But, as a miser keeps his wealth buried in the ground, so we keep our learning to ourselves and others, therefore, do not share in its benefits.
('16', 57, 2, 21, 134283) Disrespect to the mother tongue is as reprehensible as disrespect to one’s mother.
('16', 57, 2, 22, 134366) No one who is guilty of it deserves to be called a patriot.
('16', 57, 2, 23, 134426) We hear many people saying that our languages are not rich enough in words to express our highest thinking.
('16', 57, 2, 24, 134534) Gentlemen, this is no fault of the language.
('16', 57, 2, 25, 134579) It is for us to develop and enrich our language.
('16', 57, 2, 26, 134628) There was a time when English was in the same condition [as our languages].
('16', 57, 2, 27, 134704) It progressed because the British made progress and strove to develop their language.
('16', 57, 2, 28, 134790) If we fail to develop our languages, holding that English alone can help us to cultivate and express higher thoughts, there is not the least doubt that we shall continue to be slaves for ever.
('16', 57, 2, 29, 134983) So long as our languages do not acquire the power to express all our thinking and remain incapable of serving as the medium of communication for the various sciences, the nation will not get modern knowledge.
('16', 57, 2, 30, 135192) It is self evident:
('16', 58, 0, 1, 135212) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 59
('16', 58, 1, 2, 135257) 1. that the entire body of our people need this knowledge; 2. that it will never be possible for all our people to understand English; 3. that, if only an English educated individual can acquire new knowledge, it is impossible for all the people to have it.
('16', 58, 1, 3, 135515) This means that, if the first two propositions are correct, there is no hope for the masses.
('16', 58, 1, 4, 135608) For this position, however, the blame does not lie with the languages.
('16', 58, 1, 5, 135679) Tulsidas was able to express his divine ideas just in Hindi.
('16', 58, 1, 6, 135740) There are not many books in the world to equal his Ramayana.
('16', 58, 1, 7, 135801) A great patriot Like Bharat Bhushan Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, who, though a house holder, has sacrificed his all for the country, has no difficulty in expressing himself in Hindi.
('16', 58, 1, 8, 135984) He commands silvery English, but his speeches in Hindi have the brilliance of gold, like the current of the Ganga blazing like gold in sunshine as it pours down from lake Manasa.
('16', 58, 1, 9, 136163) I have heard some Maulavis delivering their sermons.
('16', 58, 1, 10, 136216) They find it easy enough to express their most profound ideas in their mother tongue.
('16', 58, 1, 11, 136302) The language of Tulsidas is perfect, immortal.
('16', 58, 1, 12, 136349) If we cannot express our thoughts in the speech which was his, surely the fault is ours.
('16', 58, 1, 13, 136438) The reason why we cannot do so is clear: the medium of education is English.
('16', 58, 1, 14, 136515) All of us can help in getting this serious anomaly removed.
('16', 58, 1, 15, 136575) I feel students can petition the Governments, respectfully, on this matter.
('16', 58, 1, 16, 136651) There is another remedy which they can simultaneously adopt, and that is, to translate what they learn at school into Hindi, share their knowledge with others in their homes, and pledge themselves to use only their mother tongue in their intercourse with one another.
('16', 58, 1, 17, 136919) I cannot bear to see one Bihari corresponding with another Bihari in English.
('16', 58, 1, 18, 136997) I have heard thousands of Englishmen talking to one another.
('16', 58, 1, 19, 137058) Some of them know other languages, but I have never heard two Englishmen talking in any foreign language among themselves.
('16', 58, 1, 20, 137181) The inordinate folly that we are guilty of in India has no parallel in the history of the world.
('16', 58, 1, 21, 137278) A Vedantist poet has said that learning without thinking is useless.
('16', 58, 1, 22, 137347) But owing to the reasons mentioned above, students’ lives seem to be almost bankrupt of thought.
('16', 58, 1, 23, 137444) They have lost all spirit and energy, are devoid of originality and most of them appear listless and apathetic.
('16', 58, 1, 24, 137556) I do not dislike English; its riches are infinite.
('16', 58, 1, 25, 137607) It is the language of administration and is rich with the wealth of know ledge.
('16', 58, 1, 26, 137687) All this notwithstanding, I hold that it is not necessary for every Indian to
('16', 59, 0, 1, 137765) 60 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 59, 1, 2, 137806) learn it.
('16', 59, 1, 3, 137816) But of this, I do not wish to speak more here.
('16', 59, 1, 4, 137863) Students have been learning English and they have no option but to do so till some other system is devised and the present schools undergo a revolution.
('16', 59, 1, 5, 138016) I shall, therefore, end this all important subject of the mother tongue here, merely saying in conclusion that in their dealings with one another, and whenever possible, people should use only their mother tongue and that others, besides students, who are present here should strive their utmost to make the mother tongue the medium of education.
('16', 59, 1, 6, 138363) As I have earlier pointed out, most of the students look listless and devoid of energy.
('16', 59, 1, 7, 138451) Many of them have asked me what they should do, how they could serve the country and what they had best do to earn their living.
('16', 59, 1, 8, 138580) I have the impression that they are most anxious about this last.
('16', 59, 1, 9, 138646) Before answering these questions, it is necessary to consider what the true aim of education is.
('16', 59, 1, 10, 138743) Huxley has said that education should aim at building character.
('16', 59, 1, 11, 138808) Our seers aver that, if a man, though well versed in the Vedas and the shastras, fails to realize the Self and to make himself worthy of liberation from all bonds, all his learning will have been in vain.
('16', 59, 1, 12, 139013) They have also said: “He who has known the Self knows all.” Selfrealization is possible even without knowledge of letters.
('16', 59, 1, 13, 139136) Prophet Mahomed was illiterate.
('16', 59, 1, 14, 139168) Jesus Christ never went to school.
('16', 59, 1, 15, 139203) But it would be foolhardy to assert, therefore, that these great souls had not attained self realization.
('16', 59, 1, 16, 139309) Though they never went to our schools and colleges to take any examination, we revere them.
('16', 59, 1, 17, 139401) They had all that learning and knowledge could bring.
('16', 59, 1, 18, 139455) They were mahatmas.
('16', 59, 1, 19, 139475) If, following their example in blind imitation of one another, we leave off attending school, we shall get nowhere, to be sure.
('16', 59, 1, 20, 139603) But we, too, can attain knowledge of the Self only by cultivating good character.
('16', 59, 1, 21, 139685) What is character, however ?
('16', 59, 1, 22, 139714) What are the hall marks of a virtuous life ?
('16', 59, 1, 23, 139759) A virtuous man is one who strives to practise truth, non violence, brahmacharya, non possession, non stealing fearless ness and such other rules of conduct.
('16', 59, 1, 24, 139916) He will give up his life rather than truth.
('16', 59, 1, 25, 139960) He will choose to die rather than kill.
('16', 59, 1, 26, 140000) He will rather suffer himself than make others suffer.
('16', 59, 1, 27, 140055) He will be as a friend even to his wife and entertain no carnal thoughts towards her.
('16', 59, 1, 28, 140141) Thus the man of virtue practises brahmacharya and tries to conserve, as well as he can, the ultimate source of energy in the body.
('16', 59, 1, 29, 140272) He does not steal, nor take bribes.
('16', 59, 1, 30, 140308) He does not waste his time nor that of others.
('16', 59, 1, 31, 140355) He does not accumulate wealth needlessly.
('16', 59, 1, 32, 140397) He does not seek ease and comfort and does not use things he does not really need but is quite content to live
('16', 60, 0, 1, 140508) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 61
('16', 60, 1, 2, 140553) a simple life.
('16', 60, 1, 3, 140568) Firm in the belief that ‘‘I am the immortal spirit and not this perishable body and that none in this world can ever kill the spirit”, he casts out all fear of suffering of mind and body and of worldly misfortunes and refusing to be held down even by an emperor, goes on doing his duty fearlessly.
('16', 60, 2, 4, 140866) If our schools never succeed in producing this result, the students, the system of education and the teachers—all three must share the blame.
('16', 60, 2, 5, 141008) It is, however, in the students’ own hands to make good the want of character.
('16', 60, 2, 6, 141087) If they are not anxious to develop character, neither teachers nor books will avail them.
('16', 60, 2, 7, 141177) Thus, as I have said earlier, we must first understand the aim of education.
('16', 60, 2, 8, 141254) A student who desires to cultivate and build character will learn how to do so from any good book on the subject.
('16', 60, 2, 9, 141368) As Tulsidas has said:
('16', 60, 3, 10, 141390) The Lord of Creation has made all things in this world, animate and inanimate, an admixture of good and evil.
('16', 60, 3, 11, 141500) But a good man selects the good and rejects the evil even as the fabled swan is said to help himself to milk leaving out water.
('16', 60, 4, 12, 141628) Being devoted to Rama, Tulsidas beheld him even in the image of Krishna.
('16', 60, 4, 13, 141701) Some of our students attend Bible classes as required by rules but they remain innocent of the teaching of the Bible.
('16', 60, 4, 14, 141819) One who reads the Gita with the intention of discovering errors in it may well succeed in doing so.
('16', 60, 4, 15, 141919) But to him who desires liberation, the Gita shows the surest way thereto.
('16', 60, 4, 16, 141993) Some people see nothing but imperfection in the Koran e Sharif, others, by meditating over it, fit themselves to cross the ocean of this earthly life.
('16', 60, 4, 17, 142144) But I am afraid that most of the students never think as to the real aim of education.
('16', 60, 4, 18, 142231) They attend school merely because that is the normal thing to do.
('16', 60, 4, 19, 142297) Some do so in order to be able to obtain employment later on.
('16', 60, 4, 20, 142359) In my humble opinion, to think of education as a means of earning a living betrays an unworthy disposition of mind.
('16', 60, 4, 21, 142475) The body is the means of earning a living, while the school is a place for building character.
('16', 60, 4, 22, 142570) To regard the latter as the means of fulfilling one’s bodily needs is like killing a buffalo for a small piece of hide.
('16', 60, 4, 23, 142690) The body should be maintained through bodily work.
('16', 60, 4, 24, 142741) How can the atman, the spirit, be employed for this purpose?
('16', 60, 4, 25, 142802) “Thou shalt earn the bread by the sweat of thy brow”—this is a mahavakya of Jesus Christ.
('16', 60, 4, 26, 142892) The Gita also seems to say the same.
('16', 60, 4, 27, 142929) About 99 per cent of the people in this world follow this law and live without fear.
('16', 60, 4, 28, 143014) “He who has given the teeth will
('16', 60, 5, 29, 143047) 1 This has been quoted from the Ramayana.
('16', 61, 0, 1, 143089) 62 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 61, 1, 2, 143130) also give the feed” is indeed a true saying.
('16', 61, 1, 3, 143175) But it is not for the lazy and indolent.
('16', 61, 1, 4, 143216) Students had better know from the very start that they will have to earn their living through bodily labour and not be ashamed of manual work to that end.
('16', 61, 1, 5, 143371) I do not mean that all of us should always be plying the hoe.
('16', 61, 1, 6, 143433) But it is necessary to understand that there is nothing wrong in plying the hoe to earn one’s living even though one may be engaged in some other avocation, and that labourers are in no way inferior to us.
('16', 61, 1, 7, 143639) One who has accepted this as a principle and an ideal, will reveal himself as a man of pure and exceptional character in the way he does his work, no matter what profession he follows.
('16', 61, 1, 8, 143824) Such a man will not be the slave of wealth; rather, wealth will be his slave.
('16', 61, 1, 9, 143902) If I am right in this, students will have to acquire the habit of doing physical labour.
('16', 61, 1, 10, 143991) I have said this for the benefit of those who look upon education as the means of earning their living.
('16', 61, 2, 11, 144095) Students who attend school without taking thought as to the true aim of education, should first make sure what it should be.
('16', 61, 2, 12, 144220) Such a student may resolve this very day that, henceforth, he will regard school as a place for building character.
('16', 61, 2, 13, 144336) I am sure that he will effect a change for the better in his character in the course of a month and that his companions will also bear witness to his having done so.
('16', 61, 2, 14, 144502) The shastras assert that we become what we think.
('16', 61, 3, 15, 144552) Many students feel that it is not necessary to make any special effort for health.
('16', 61, 3, 16, 144635) However, regular exercise is absolutely necessary for the body.
('16', 61, 3, 17, 144699) What can be expected of a student who is not well equipped in health?
('16', 61, 3, 18, 144769) Just as milk cannot be held in a paper container, so also education is not likely to remain for long in the paper like bodies of our students.
('16', 61, 3, 19, 144912) The body is the abode of the spirit and, therefore, holy like a place of pilgrimage.
('16', 61, 3, 20, 144997) We must see that it is well protected.
('16', 61, 3, 21, 145036) Walking regularly and energetically for an hour and a half in the morning and for the same period in the evening in open air keeps it healthy and the mind fresh.
('16', 61, 3, 22, 145198) The time thus spent is not wasted.
('16', 61, 3, 23, 145233) Such exercise, coupled with rest, will invigorate both the body and the intellect, enabling one to learn things more quickly.
('16', 61, 3, 24, 145359) I think games like cricket have no place in a poor country like India.
('16', 61, 3, 25, 145430) We have a number of inexpensive games of our own which afford innocent joy.
('16', 61, 4, 26, 145506) The daily life of the student should be above reproach.
('16', 61, 4, 27, 145562) He alone can experience true delight whose mind is pure.
('16', 61, 4, 28, 145619) Indeed, to ask such a man to seek delight in worldly pleasures is to deprive him of the real delight which is his.
('16', 61, 4, 29, 145734) He who has resolved to rise does indeed rise.
('16', 62, 0, 1, 145780) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 63
('16', 62, 1, 2, 145825) Ramachandra, in his innocence, wished for the moon and he got it.
('16', 62, 2, 3, 145891) From one point of view, the world seems to be an illusion; from another, it seems real enough.
('16', 62, 2, 4, 145986) For students, the world does indeed exist, for it is they who have to strive for great achievement in it.
('16', 62, 2, 5, 146092) He who declares the world to be illusory without knowing what that really means, indulges in pleasures as the fancy takes him and then claims to have renounced the world, is welcome to call himself a sannyasi but in reality he is a deluded man.
('16', 62, 3, 6, 146337) This brings me to the subject of dharma.
('16', 62, 3, 7, 146378) Where there is no dharma, there can be neither knowledge nor wealth, nor health, nor anything else.
('16', 62, 3, 8, 146478) Where there is no dharma, life is devoid of all joy, is mere emptiness.
('16', 62, 3, 9, 146550) We have had to go without instruction in dharma; we are in much the same position as the bridegroom’s party at a wedding without the bridegroom.
('16', 62, 3, 10, 146695) Students cannot have innocent joy without a knowledge of dharma.
('16', 62, 3, 11, 146760) That they may have such joy, it is necessary for them to study the shastras, to reflect over their teaching and bring their conduct in conformity with their ideals.
('16', 62, 3, 12, 146925) Smoking a cigarette the first thing in the morning or idle gossip does good to nobody.
('16', 62, 3, 13, 147012) Nazir has said that, even the sparrows as they twitter, sing the name of the Lord morning and evening, when we are still lying in our beds full length.
('16', 62, 3, 14, 147164) It is the duty of every student to acquire the knowledge of dharma in any manner he can.
('16', 62, 3, 15, 147253) Whether or not dharma is taught in schools, it is my prayer to students who have assembled here that they introduce its essential principles in their life.
('16', 62, 3, 16, 147409) What exactly is dharma?
('16', 62, 3, 17, 147433) In what manner can instruction in religion be imparted?
('16', 62, 3, 18, 147489) This is not the place for a discussion of this subject.
('16', 62, 3, 19, 147545) But I shall give you this practical advice, based on my own experience, that you should take to the Ramacharitamanasa [of Tulsidas] and the Bhagavad Gita in love and reverence.
('16', 62, 3, 20, 147722) You have a real jewel in the latter; seize it.
('16', 62, 3, 21, 147769) But see that you study these two books in order to learn the secret of dharma.
('16', 62, 3, 22, 147848) The seers who wrote these works did not set out to write history but only to teach dharma and morals.
('16', 62, 3, 23, 147950) Millions of people read these books and lead pure lives.
('16', 62, 3, 24, 148007) They read them with a guileless heart and live in this world full of innocent joy.
('16', 62, 3, 25, 148090) It never occurs to them even in a dream to ask whether or not Ravana was a historical figure or whether they might not kill their enemies as Rama killed Ravana.
('16', 62, 3, 26, 148251) Even when face to face with enemies, they pray for Ramachandra’s protection and remain unafraid.
('16', 62, 3, 27, 148348) Tulsidas, the author of the Ramayana, had nothing but compassion by way of a weapon.
('16', 62, 3, 28, 148433) He desired to kill none.
('16', 63, 0, 1, 148458) 64 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 63, 1, 2, 148499) creates, destroys.
('16', 63, 1, 3, 148518) Rama was God; He had created Ravana and so had the right to kill him.
('16', 63, 1, 4, 148588) When any of us becomes God, he may consider whether he is fit to have the power to destroy.
('16', 63, 1, 5, 148680) I have ventured to say this by way of introduction to these great books.
('16', 63, 1, 6, 148753) I was, myself, a sceptic once and lived in fear of being destroyed.
('16', 63, 1, 7, 148821) I have grown out of that stage and become a believer.
('16', 63, 1, 8, 148875) I have thought it fit here to describe the influence which these books have had on me.
('16', 63, 1, 9, 148962) For Muslim students, the Koran is the best book in this respect.
('16', 63, 1, 10, 149027) I would counsel them as well that they study this book in a spirit of devotion.
('16', 63, 1, 11, 149107) They should understand its true message.
('16', 63, 1, 12, 149148) I feel, too, that both Hindus and Muslims should study each other’s religious scriptures with due respect and try to understand them.
('16', 63, 2, 13, 149282) From this most absorbing subject, I shall pass on to a topic of more worldly interest.
('16', 63, 2, 14, 149369) It is often asked whether it is proper for students to take part in politics.
('16', 63, 2, 15, 149447) I will let you know my opinion about it without going into the reasons.
('16', 63, 2, 16, 149519) Politics has two aspects, theoretical study and practical activity.
('16', 63, 2, 17, 149587) It is essential that students be introduced to the former, but it is harmful for them to concern themselves with the latter.
('16', 63, 2, 18, 149712) They may attend political meetings or the sessions of the Congress in order to learn the science of politics.
('16', 63, 2, 19, 149822) Such gatherings are useful as object lessons.
('16', 63, 2, 20, 149868) Students should have complete freedom to attend them and every effort should be made to get the recent ban on them removed.
('16', 63, 2, 21, 149992) Students may not speak or vote at such meetings but may serve as volunteers if that does not interfere with their studies.
('16', 63, 2, 22, 150115) No student can afford to miss an opportunity of serving Malaviyaji if one comes his way.
('16', 63, 2, 23, 150204) Students should keep away from party politics.
('16', 63, 2, 24, 150251) They should remain detached and cultivate respect for the leaders of the nation.
('16', 63, 2, 25, 150332) It is not for them to judge the latter.
('16', 63, 2, 26, 150372) Students easily respond to excellences of character, they adore them.
('16', 63, 2, 27, 150442) They say it is the duty of students to look upon elders with reverence and respect their words.
('16', 63, 2, 28, 150538) This is well said.
('16', 63, 2, 29, 150557) He who has not learnt to respect others cannot hope for respect for himself.
('16', 63, 2, 30, 150634) An attitude of insolence ill becomes students.
('16', 63, 2, 31, 150681) In this respect, an unusual situation has come about in India.
('16', 63, 2, 32, 150744) Older folk are careless how they behave, or fail to maintain their dignity.
('16', 63, 2, 33, 150820) What are the students to do in these circumstances?
('16', 63, 2, 34, 150872) As I imagine, a student should have regard for dharma.
('16', 63, 2, 35, 150927) Such a student, when faced with a moral dilemma, should recall the instance of Prahlad.
('16', 63, 2, 36, 151015) Placed in circumstances in which this boy respectfully disobeyed the commands of his father, we can act in like manner towards elders resembling the
('16', 64, 0, 1, 151164) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 65
('16', 64, 1, 2, 151209) latter.
('16', 64, 1, 3, 151217) But any disrespect shown to them beyond this will be wrong.
('16', 64, 1, 4, 151277) It will ruin the community.
('16', 64, 1, 5, 151305) An elder is so not merely by virtue of his age, but by virtue of the knowledge, experience and wisdom which age brings.
('16', 64, 1, 6, 151425) Where these are absent, the elder’s position depends simply on his age.
('16', 64, 1, 7, 151497) Nobody, however, worships age as such.
('16', 64, 2, 8, 151536) Another question is: How can students serve the country ?
('16', 64, 2, 9, 151594) The simple answer is that a student should study well, safeguarding his health meanwhile and cherishing the aim of using the fruits of his study in the service of the country.
('16', 64, 2, 10, 151770) I am quite sure he will thereby serve his country.
('16', 64, 2, 11, 151821) By living a purposeful life and taking care to be unmindful of our own interests and to work for others, we can achieve much with little effort.
('16', 64, 2, 12, 151966) I want to tell you of one task of this kind.
('16', 64, 2, 13, 152011) You must have seen my letter in the newspapers about the difficulties of third class passengers.
('16', 64, 2, 14, 152108) I suppose most of you travel third.
('16', 64, 2, 15, 152144) These passengers spit in the compartment; they also spit out the remains of betel leaves and tobacco which they chew right in the carriage, and likewise throw the skins of bananas, etc., and other leavings on the floor of the carriage; they are careless in the use of the latrine and foul it.
('16', 64, 2, 16, 152437) They smoke bidis and cigarettes without any regard for the convenience of fellow passengers.
('16', 64, 2, 17, 152530) We can explain to the other passengers in our compartment the harm that results from their dirtying the place.
('16', 64, 2, 18, 152641) Most passengers respect students and listen to them.
('16', 64, 2, 19, 152694) They should not then miss these excellent opportunities of explaining the rules of hygiene to the masses.
('16', 64, 2, 20, 152800) The eatables sold at stations are dirty.
('16', 64, 2, 21, 152841) It is the duty of students, when they find the things dirty, to draw the attention of the traffic manager to the fact, whether he replies or no.
('16', 64, 2, 22, 152986) And take care that you write to him in Hindi.
('16', 64, 2, 23, 153032) When he receives many such letters, he will be forced to heed them.
('16', 64, 2, 24, 153100) This is easy work to do but it will yield important results.
('16', 64, 3, 25, 153161) I have spoken about the habits of chewing betel leaves and tobacco.
('16', 64, 3, 26, 153229) In my humble opinion, these habits are both harmful and unclean.
('16', 64, 3, 27, 153294) Most of us, men and women, have become their slaves.
('16', 64, 3, 28, 153347) We must be free of this slavery.
('16', 64, 3, 29, 153380) A stranger visiting India will surely think that we are always eating some thing or the other.
('16', 64, 3, 30, 153475) That the betel leaf, possibly, helps to digest food may be conceded, but food eaten in the proper quantity and manner is digested without any help from things like the betel leaf.
('16', 64, 3, 31, 153655) Moreover, it does not have even an agreeable taste.
('16', 64, 3, 32, 153707) And tobacco chewing must be given up as well.
('16', 64, 3, 33, 153753) Students should always practise self control.
('16', 64, 3, 34, 153799) It is also necessary to consider the habit
('16', 65, 0, 1, 153842) 66 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 65, 1, 2, 153883) of smoking.
('16', 65, 1, 3, 153895) Our rulers have set a bad example in this respect.
('16', 65, 1, 4, 153946) They smoke cigarettes anywhere and everywhere.
('16', 65, 1, 5, 153993) This has led us to consider smoking a fashion, and to turn our mouths into chimneys.
('16', 65, 1, 6, 154078) Many books have been written to show that smoking is harmful.
('16', 65, 1, 7, 154140) We call this age Kaliyuga.
('16', 65, 1, 8, 154167) Christians believe that Jesus Christ will come again when selfishness, immorality, addiction to drugs and drink, etc., become rife.
('16', 65, 1, 9, 154299) I shall not consider to what extent we may accept this as true.
('16', 65, 1, 10, 154363) But I do feel that the world has been suffering a great deal from evils such as drinking, smoking, addiction to opium, ganja, hemp and so on.
('16', 65, 1, 11, 154505) All of us are caught in this snare and so we cannot truly measure the magnitude of its unhappy consequences.
('16', 65, 1, 12, 154614) It is my prayer that you, the students, keep away from them.
('16', 65, 2, 13, 154675) This Conference has entered its seventeenth year.
('16', 65, 2, 14, 154725) The speeches of the Presidents in previous years were sent to me I have gone through them.
('16', 65, 2, 15, 154816) What is the object behind arranging these speeches?
('16', 65, 2, 16, 154868) If it is that you may learn something from them, ask yourselves what you have learnt.
('16', 65, 2, 17, 154954) If it is just to hear a beautiful flow of English words and enhance the prestige of the Conference, I feel sorry for you.
('16', 65, 2, 18, 155076) I take it that these speeches are arranged with the idea that you may learn something from them and put it into practice.
('16', 65, 2, 19, 155198) How many of you followed Smt.
('16', 65, 2, 20, 155228) Besant’s advice and adopted the Indian mode of dress, simplified your food habits and gave up unclean talk or acted on Prof.
('16', 65, 2, 21, 155353) Jadunath Sarkar’s advice and spent your vacations in teaching the poor, free of charge?
('16', 65, 2, 22, 155441) I can put many questions.
('16', 65, 2, 23, 155467) I do not ask for a reply.
('16', 65, 2, 24, 155493) You may answer these questions to your own conscience.
('16', 65, 2, 25, 155548) The worth of your learning will be judged by your actions.
('16', 65, 2, 26, 155607) Stuffing your brains with the contents of hundreds of books may bring its reward but action is of much greater value by far.
('16', 65, 2, 27, 155732) One’s stock of learning is of no more value than the action it leads to.
('16', 65, 2, 28, 155805) The rest is an unnecessary burden.
('16', 65, 2, 29, 155840) I would, therefore, always request you and urge you to practise what you learn and what appears to you to be right.
('16', 65, 2, 30, 155956) That is the only way to progress.

('16', 66, 3, 4, 156148) MAGANLAL 1, It is not surprising that the sight of funeral pyres made you momentarily nervous.
('16', 66, 3, 5, 156243) If men had some rule and discipline in their lives, death would come at the right time and funeral pyres would take their natural course.
('16', 66, 3, 6, 156381) We are upset when a storm brings down unripe fruit.
('16', 66, 3, 7, 156433) We are content to see ripe fruit fall.
('16', 66, 3, 8, 156472) The same isthe case with human lives.
('16', 66, 3, 9, 156510) When people die in consequence of calamities such as the plague, we take the thing to heart.
('16', 66, 3, 10, 156603) It is satyayuga 2 when such things don’t happen.
('16', 66, 3, 11, 156652) It is for us to bring about the times when there will be no reason to fear death.
('16', 66, 3, 12, 156734) If we do our best, satyayuga will have dawned for us.
('16', 66, 3, 13, 156788) We should always be prepared for death and live without fear.
('16', 66, 3, 14, 156850) To teach one to live such a life—that is the aim of the Ashram 3. You are all doing something great indeed.
('16', 66, 3, 15, 156958) It is an excellent thing to live in tents and put up with hardships.
('16', 66, 3, 16, 157027) If we had stayed on in the bungalow, we would have had to hang our heads in shame.
('16', 66, 3, 17, 157110) Living in tents, you are all getting beaten into shape.
('16', 66, 3, 18, 157166) You are being educated.
('16', 66, 3, 19, 157190) You are setting an example.
('16', 66, 3, 20, 157218) You are learning to fight it out with Nature.
('16', 66, 3, 21, 157264) Anyone who resolves to live such a life can do so.
('16', 66, 4, 22, 157315) I am in good cheer.
('16', 66, 4, 23, 157335) I shall be able to go to the Ashram only after I have finished with Broach.

('16', 67, 2, 3, 157804) [After October 19, 1917]
('16', 67, 3, 4, 157829) Merchants always have the spirit of adventure, intellect and wealth, as without these qualities their business cannot go on.
('16', 67, 3, 5, 157954) But, now, they must have the fervour of patriotism in them.
('16', 67, 3, 6, 158014) Patriotism is necessary even for religion.
('16', 67, 3, 7, 158057) If the spirit of patriotism is awakened through religious fervour, then, that patriotism will shine out brilliantly.
('16', 67, 3, 8, 158174) So it is necessary that patriotism should be roused in the mercantile community.
('16', 67, 3, 9, 158255) The merchants take more part in public affairs now a days than before.
('16', 67, 3, 10, 158326) When merchants take to politics through patriotism, swaraj is as good as obtained.
('16', 67, 3, 11, 158409) Some of you might be wondering how we can get swaraj.
('16', 67, 3, 12, 158463) I lay my hand on my heart and say that, when the merchant class understands the spirit of patriotism, then only can we get swaraj quickly.
('16', 67, 3, 13, 158602) Swaraj then will be quite a natural thing.
('16', 67, 3, 14, 158645) Amongst the various keys which will unlock swaraj to us, the swadeshi 2 vow is the golden one.
('16', 67, 3, 15, 158740) It is in the hands of the merchants to compel the observance of the swadeshi vow in the country, and this is an adventure which can be popularized by the merchants.
('16', 67, 3, 16, 158905) I humbly request you to undertake this adventure and then you will see what wonders you can do.
('16', 67, 3, 17, 159001) This being so, I have to say with regret that it is the merchant class which has brought ruin to the swadeshi practice and the swadeshi movement in this country.
('16', 67, 3, 18, 159163) Complaints have lately risen in Bengal about the increase of rates, and one of them is against Gujarat.
('16', 67, 3, 19, 159267) It is complained there that the prices of dhotis have been abnormally increased and dhotis go from Gujarat.
('16', 67, 3, 20, 159375) No one wants you not to earn money, but it must be earned righteously and not be ill gotten.
('16', 67, 3, 21, 159468) Merchants must earn money by fair means.
('16', 67, 3, 22, 159509) Unfair means must never be used.
('16', 67, 3, 23, 159542) India’s strength lies with the merchant class.
('16', 67, 3, 24, 159589) So much does not lie even with the army.
('16', 67, 3, 25, 159630) Trade is the cause of war, and the merchant

('16', 68, 1, 3, 160118) Merchants raise the money and the army is raised on the strength of it.
('16', 68, 1, 4, 160190) The power of England and Germany rests on their trading class.
('16', 68, 1, 5, 160253) A country’s prosperity depends upon its mercantile community.
('16', 68, 1, 6, 160315) I consider it as a sign of good luck that I should receive an address from the merchant class.
('16', 68, 1, 7, 160410) Whenever I remember Broach, I will enquire if the merchants who have given me an address this day have righteous faith and patriotism.
('16', 68, 1, 8, 160545) If I receive a disappointing reply, I will think that merely a wave of giving addresses had come over India and that I had a share in it.

('16', 68, 4, 11, 160775) BROACH, October 20, I917
('16', 68, 5, 12, 160800) Gandhiji prefaced the speech with an apology to the audience: As it is already late, reading my speech will proceed beyond the time limit fixed for it.
('16', 68, 5, 13, 160952) I read it because I am under pressure from friends here to do so.
('16', 68, 5, 14, 161018) When preparing the speech, I took the utmost care to see that it briefly expressed all that I wished to say, but it has become longer than I expected.
('16', 68, 5, 15, 161169) I hope to be excused, therefore, if in reading it I exceed my time.
('16', 68, 6, 16, 161237) Gandhiji then read the speech from a printed text.
('16', 68, 7, 17, 161288) DEAR SISTERS AND BROTHERS, You have done me a great honour in selecting me to be the President of this Conference.
('16', 68, 7, 18, 161403) I know that I do not have the necessary learning for this office.
('16', 68, 7, 19, 161469) I know, too, that my work in other spheres in the service of our country does not, and cannot, qualify me for the honour you have conferred on me today.
('16', 68, 7, 20, 161622) I have but one qualification for it, that I would not, I am perfectly sure, be content with anything but the first place in a contest for demonstrating one’s love for Gujarati.
('16', 68, 7, 21, 161799) Indeed, it is because I am confident of this that I have accepted this onerous responsibility.
('16', 68, 7, 22, 161894) I hope that the generosity which has prompted you to give me this honour will also prompt you to forgive all my shortcomings, and help me in this work—which is as

('16', 69, 1, 2, 162255) much yours as mine.
('16', 69, 1, 3, 162275) This Conference is but a year old.
('16', 69, 1, 4, 162310) Just as, in the case of a great man, we often find indications of his future greatness even in his infancy, so it is with this Conference.
('16', 69, 1, 5, 162449) I have read the report of its work for the last year.
('16', 69, 1, 6, 162503) It is a report which would do credit to any institution.
('16', 69, 1, 7, 162560) The Secretaries are to be congratulated on having prepared and published this valuable report in time.
('16', 69, 1, 8, 162663) It is our good fortune that we have such able secretaries.
('16', 69, 1, 9, 162722) To those who have not yet read this report, I suggest that they do so and ponder over it.
('16', 69, 1, 10, 162812) The death of Shri Ranjitram Vavabhai 1 last year has been a great loss to us.
('16', 69, 1, 11, 162890) It is a matter of deep regret that a man of letters like him was snatched away from our midst in the prime of life; this should make us pause and think.
('16', 69, 1, 12, 163043) May God grant peace to the departed soul.
('16', 69, 1, 13, 163085) I would request the members of his family to take strength in the thought that we all share their grief.
('16', 69, 1, 14, 163190) The organization 2 which has called this Conference has set three aims before itself: 1. To create and give expression to public opinion on questions of education.
('16', 69, 1, 15, 163354) 2. To carry on propaganda in regard to educational questions in Gujarat.
('16', 69, 1, 16, 163427) 3. To undertake concrete activities for promoting education in Gujarat.
('16', 69, 1, 17, 163499) I shall endeavour to place before you the results of my thinking, such as it has been, on these three aims.
('16', 69, 1, 18, 163607) It should be obvious to everyone that the first thing to do in this connection is to come to a definite decision about the medium of instruction.
('16', 69, 1, 19, 163753) Unless that is done, all other efforts, I fear, are likely to prove fruitless.
('16', 69, 1, 20, 163832) To impart education without first considering the question of the medium of instruction will be like raising a building without a foundation.
('16', 69, 1, 21, 163974) On this point, two views prevail among educationists.
('16', 69, 1, 22, 164028) Some hold that education should be imparted through the mother tongue; that is, through Gujarati.
('16', 69, 1, 23, 164126) Others contend that it should be imparted through

('16', 70, 1, 4, 164566) But mere good intentions are not enough to gain the end we desire.
('16', 70, 1, 5, 164633) It is the experience of the world that good intentions do occasionally take us to unworthy places We must, therefore, critically examine both these views and, if possible, come to a unanimous decision on this great and important question.
('16', 70, 1, 6, 164872) There is no doubt whatsoever that the issue is of the utmost importance and we cannot consider it too carefully.
('16', 70, 1, 7, 164985) This question concerns the whole of India.
('16', 70, 1, 8, 165028) But each Presidency or Province may decide this matter for itself.
('16', 70, 1, 9, 165095) It is erroneous to think that, until unanimity has been reached about it, Gujarat cannot go ahead by itself.
('16', 70, 1, 10, 165204) We can, however, solve some of our difficulties by considering what they have done about it in other Provinces.
('16', 70, 1, 11, 165316) At the time of the Bengal partition 1, when the spirit of swadeshi was at its height, an effort was made there to impart education through Bengali.
('16', 70, 1, 12, 165464) A national school 2 was also started.
('16', 70, 1, 13, 165502) Money poured forth in plenty.
('16', 70, 1, 14, 165532) But the experiment failed.
('16', 70, 1, 15, 165559) In my humble opinion, the sponsors of the movement had no faith in their experiment.
('16', 70, 1, 16, 165644) The teachers were in the same pitiable condition.
('16', 70, 1, 17, 165694) In Bengal, the educated classes are blindly in love with English.
('16', 70, 1, 18, 165760) It has been suggested that the progress made by Bengali literature in recent times is mainly due to the profound knowledge of English language and literature among the Bengalis.
('16', 70, 1, 19, 165938) But the facts are against this assumption.
('16', 70, 1, 20, 165981) The bewitching style of our beloved poet—Rabindranath Tagore 3 —does not owe its excellence to his knowledge of English.
('16', 70, 1, 21, 166102) Its source lies rather in his love for his own language.
('16', 70, 1, 22, 166159) Gitanjali was originally written in Bengali.
('16', 70, 1, 23, 166204) This great poet always uses his mother tongue when in Bengal.
('16', 70, 1, 24, 166266) The great speech he recently made at Calcutta on present day conditions in India was in Bengali.
('16', 70, 1, 25, 166363) Among those who went to hear him were some of the most prominent men and women from his part of the country.
('16', 70, 1, 26, 166472) And I have been told by those who heard him on the occasion that he kept the audience literally spell bound for an hour and a half with the flow of
('16', 70, 2, 27, 166620) 1 In 1905, on grounds of administrative convenience, Bengal was divided into two provinces, one of which was predominantly Hindu and the other, Muslim.
('16', 70, 2, 28, 166772) The partition, which raised a storm of protest throughout India and let to the movement for boycott of British goods, was finally annulled in 1911. 2 A council and a society for promotion of national education were set up.

('16', 71, 1, 4, 167250) He says, he has acquired them from the atmosphere of this country.
('16', 71, 1, 5, 167317) He has culled them from the Upanishads 1. It is our glorious Indian sky which has inspired him.
('16', 71, 1, 6, 167413) I believe it is the same with other Bengali authors.
('16', 71, 2, 7, 167466) When Mahatma Munshiram 2, serene and sublime like the Himalayas, speaks in Hindi, men, women and children alike enjoy listening to him and follow him.
('16', 71, 2, 8, 167617) He has reserved his English for his English friends.
('16', 71, 2, 9, 167670) He does not make his [Hindi] speeches with English phrases in his mind.
('16', 71, 3, 10, 167742) It is said that the English of the revered Madan Mohan Malaviya 3, who, though a householder, has dedicated his all to the country, shines like silver.
('16', 71, 3, 11, 167894) Even the Viceroy has to take note of anything that Malaviyaji says.
('16', 71, 3, 12, 167962) But, if his English is like shining silver, his Hindi, the flow of the Ganga that it is, shines like gold even as the latter does when flowing down from Manasarovar.
('16', 71, 3, 13, 168128) These three great speakers have acquired this power of eloquence not from their knowledge of English but from the love of their own language.
('16', 71, 3, 14, 168270) Swami Dayanand 4 did great service to Hindi not because he knew English but because he loved the Hindi language.
('16', 71, 3, 15, 168383) English had nothing to do with Tukaram 5 and Ramadas 6 shedding lustre on Marathi.

('16', 72, 1, 2, 169665) Dalpatram 1, have greatly enriched Gujarati literature; their glorious success is not to be attributed to their knowledge of English.
('16', 72, 1, 3, 169799) The above examples prove beyond doubt that, for the enrichment of the mother tongue, what is needed is not knowledge of English but love for one’s own language and faith in it.
('16', 72, 2, 4, 169976) We shall arrive at the same conclusion by examining the growth and development of various languages.
('16', 72, 2, 5, 170077) A language mirrors the character of the people who use it.
('16', 72, 2, 6, 170136) We acquire information about the manners and customs of the Negroes of South Africa by studying their native tongue.
('16', 72, 2, 7, 170253) A language takes its form from the character and life of those who speak it.
('16', 72, 2, 8, 170330) We can say without hesit ation that the people whose language does not reflect the qualities of courage, truthfulness and compassion are deficient in those virtues.
('16', 72, 2, 9, 170495) Importing of words expressive of courage or compassion from other tongues will not enrich or widen the content of a language nor make its speakers brave and kind.
('16', 72, 2, 10, 170658) Courage is not to be had as a gift; if it is there within, covered with rust though it be, it will shine forth when that covering disappears.
('16', 72, 2, 11, 170800) In our own mother tongue, we find a large number of words denoting an excess of meekness, because we have lived under subjection for many years.
('16', 72, 2, 12, 170945) Similarly, no other language in the world has as many nautical terms as English.
('16', 72, 2, 13, 171026) Supposing that an enterprising Gujarati writer were to render books on the subject from English into Gujarati, it would not add one whit to the range and power of our language, nor would it in any way increase our knowledge of ships.
('16', 72, 2, 14, 171260) But as soon as we start building ships and raise a navy, the necessary technical phraseology will automatically establish itself.
('16', 72, 2, 15, 171390) The late Rev.
('16', 72, 2, 16, 171404) Taylor has expressed this same view in his book on Gujarati grammar.
('16', 72, 2, 17, 171473) He says:
('16', 72, 3, 18, 171482) One frequently hears people arguing whether the Gujarati language is perfect or imperfect.
('16', 72, 3, 19, 171573) There is a proverb saying: “As the King, so the people”, and another “As the teacher, so the disciple”.
('16', 72, 3, 20, 171677) In the same way, we might say, “As the speaker, so the language”.
('16', 72, 3, 21, 171743) It does not appear that poets like Shamal Bhatt and others ever felt handicapped in expressing the innumerable thoughts in their minds because of any sense of deficiency in Gujarati.
('16', 72, 3, 22, 171926) Indeed, they displayed such fine discrimination in the disposing of new and old words that whatever they said or wrote passed into currency and was incorporated in the speech of the people.

('16', 73, 0, 1, 172158) 74 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 73, 1, 2, 172199) In some respects, all the languages of the world are imperfect.
('16', 73, 1, 3, 172263) When speaking of things beyond man’s limited intellect, of God and Eternity, we shall find every language imperfect.
('16', 73, 1, 4, 172380) Language is but a function of man’s intellect.
('16', 73, 1, 5, 172427) Hence, when the intellect fails to reach out to or fully comprehend a subject, the language [expressing the thought] will be imperfect.
('16', 73, 1, 6, 172563) The general principle concerning a language is that the ideas which find expression in it reflect the minds of the people who speak it.
('16', 73, 1, 7, 172699) If the people are courteous, so is their language; if the people are foolish, the language is equally so.
('16', 73, 1, 8, 172805) All English proverb says: “A bad carpenter quarrels with his tools.” Those who complain of the imperfection of their language often do much the same.
('16', 73, 1, 9, 172955) A student with a smattering of the English language and English learning may feel tempted to think that Gujarati is imperfect, for an accurate translation from English into one’s own mother tongue is difficult.
('16', 73, 1, 10, 173166) The fault does not lie with the language but with the people who use it.
('16', 73, 1, 11, 173239) Inasmuch as the people do not practise exercising their judgment to follow new expressions, new subjects and new styles, the writer hesitates to use them.
('16', 73, 1, 12, 173394) Who will be foolhardy enough to sing in front of a deaf man?
('16', 73, 1, 13, 173455) As long as the people are not ready to discriminate between good and bad, or new and old and evaluate things aright, how can we expect a writer’s genius to blossom forth ?
('16', 73, 2, 14, 173627) Some of those who translate from English seem to labour under the impression that they have imbibed Gujarati with their mother’s milk and learnt English through study and are, therefore, perfect bilinguists.
('16', 73, 2, 15, 173835) Why, they ask, should they study Gujarati?
('16', 73, 2, 16, 173878) But surely acquisition of proficiency in one’s own language is more important than the effort spent over mastering a foreign one.
('16', 73, 2, 17, 174008) Look up the works of poets like Shamal and others.
('16', 73, 2, 18, 174059) Every verse bears evidence of study and labour.
('16', 73, 2, 19, 174107) Gujarati may seem imperfect before one has struggled with it, but afterwards one will find it mature enough.
('16', 73, 2, 20, 174216) He whose effort is half hearted will wield the language but imperfectly; the writer or speaker whose effort is unsparing will likewise command Gujarati that is perfect; nay, it may even be polished.
('16', 73, 2, 21, 174415) Gujarati, of the Aryan family, a daughter of Sanskrit, related to some of the best languages—who dare call her undeveloped?
('16', 73, 3, 22, 174539) May God bless her!
('16', 73, 3, 23, 174558) May she speak, till the end of ages, of wisdom and learning ever the best and of true religion.
('16', 73, 3, 24, 174654) May God, the Creator, grant us that we hear her praises from the mother and the student, for ever and for ever.
('16', 73, 3, 25, 174766) Thus, we see that the failure of the movement to impart education through the medium of Bengali in Bengal does not show any inherent imperfection in that language or the futility of such an

('16', 74, 1, 2, 175001) effort.
('16', 74, 1, 3, 175009) We have considered the point about imperfection; as for futility, the experiment in Bengal does not prove it.
('16', 74, 1, 4, 175119) If anything, it only shows the incompetence of those who made the effort, or their lack of faith in it.
('16', 74, 1, 5, 175223) In the North, Hindi is certainly making good progress.
('16', 74, 1, 6, 175278) But a persistent effort to use it as the medium of instruction has been made only by the Arya Samajists in the gurukulas.
('16', 74, 1, 7, 175400) In Madras, the movement for using the mother tongue as the medium of education started only a few years ago.
('16', 74, 1, 8, 175509) The Telugu people are more active in this respect than the Tamilians.
('16', 74, 1, 9, 175579) The latter are so dominated by the influence of English that they have little enthusiasm for making an effort to use Tamil as the medium of instruction.
('16', 74, 1, 10, 175732) In the Telugu speaking region, English education has not yet penetrated to the same extent.
('16', 74, 1, 11, 175824) Therefore, the people in that part use the mother tongue more than the Tamilians.
('16', 74, 1, 12, 175906) The Telugu people are not only carrying on experiments to impart education through their own language but have also started a movement for the redistribution of India on the basis of language.
('16', 74, 1, 13, 176099) The movement is of recent origin, and is as yet in the initial stage.
('16', 74, 1, 14, 176169) But so vigorous is their effort that it is not unlikely that we may see the idea being given a practical shape before long.
('16', 74, 1, 15, 176293) There are rocks on the way, but their leaders have given me the impression that they have the strength all right to break them.
('16', 74, 1, 16, 176421) Maharashtra is making the same attempt, sponsored by the great and noble Prof.
('16', 74, 1, 17, 176500) Karve 1. Shri Nayak holds the same view.
('16', 74, 1, 18, 176541) Private schools have taken up the task.
('16', 74, 1, 19, 176581) With great effort, Prof.
('16', 74, 1, 20, 176606) Vijapurkar 2 has revived his plan and we shall shortly see his school functioning.
('16', 74, 1, 21, 176689) He had drawn up a plan for preparing text books.
('16', 74, 1, 22, 176738) Some of these have already been printed, others are ready in manuscript.
('16', 74, 1, 23, 176811) The teachers of that school never wavered in their faith.
('16', 74, 1, 24, 176869) If, unfortunately, it had not been closed, it would have by now settled the controversy whether or not Marathi can serve as the medium of education even at the highest level.
('16', 74, 1, 25, 177044) In Gujarat, too, this movement has got started.

('16', 75, 1, 3, 177634) Gajjar 2 and the late Diwan Bahadur Manibhai Jasbhai may be regarded as the leaders of this movement.
('16', 75, 1, 4, 177736) It is now for us to decide whether or not we should help the growth of the seeds sown by these persons.
('16', 75, 1, 5, 177840) To my mind, there is no doubt that the more we delay, the greater our loss.
('16', 75, 1, 6, 177916) It requires a minimum of 16 years to complete one’s education through the medium of English.
('16', 75, 1, 7, 178009) If the same subjects were taught through the mother tongue, it would take ten years at the most.
('16', 75, 1, 8, 178106) This is the opinion expressed by many experienced teachers.
('16', 75, 1, 9, 178166) A saving of six years for each of the thousands of students means a saving of thousands of years for the nation.
('16', 75, 1, 10, 178279) Education through a foreign language entails an excessive strain which only our boys could bear, they must needs pay dearly for it, though.
('16', 75, 1, 11, 178419) To a large extent, they lose the capacity of shoulder ing any other burden afterwards.
('16', 75, 1, 12, 178506) Our graduates, therefore, are a useless lot, weak of body, without any zest for work, and mere imitators.
('16', 75, 1, 13, 178612) They suffer an atrophy of the creative faculty and of the capacity for original thinking, and grow up without the spirit of enterprise and the qualities of perseverance, courage and fearless ness.
('16', 75, 1, 14, 178809) That is why we are unable to make new plans or carry out those we make.
('16', 75, 1, 15, 178881) A few who do show promise of these qualities usually die young.
('16', 75, 1, 16, 178945) An Englishman has said that there is the same difference between Europeans and the people of other countries as between an original piece of writing and its impression on a piece of blotting paper.
('16', 75, 1, 17, 179143) The element of truth in this statement is not to be attributed to any natural or innate incapacity on the part of the Asians.
('16', 75, 1, 18, 179269) The reason lies, in a large measure, in the unsuitable med ium of instruction.

('16', 76, 1, 4, 180282) It is only we, the English educated people, who are unable to assess the great loss that results.
('16', 76, 1, 5, 180380) Some idea of it may be had if we estimate how little has been our influence on the general mass of our people.
('16', 76, 1, 6, 180491) The occasional remarks which our parents are led to make about the worthlessness of our education have some point.

('16', 76, 2, 10, 181118) That is why everything that they do bears the stamp of originality.
('16', 76, 2, 11, 181186) They are now in a position to teach their teachers.
('16', 76, 2, 12, 181238) They have belied the comparison [of non Euro pean peoples] with blotting paper.
('16', 76, 2, 13, 181318) The life of the Japanese is throb bing with vitality and the world looks on in amazement.
('16', 76, 2, 14, 181408) The system under which we are educated through a foreign language results in incalculable harm.
('16', 76, 3, 15, 181504) The continuity that should exist, on the one hand, between the culture the child imbibes along with the mother’s milk and the sweet words it receives and, on the other, the training school, is broken when education is imparted through a foreign tongue.
('16', 76, 3, 16, 181757) Those who are responsible for this are enemies of the people, howsoever honest their motives.
('16', 76, 3, 17, 181851) To be a voluntary victim of this system of education is to betray one’s duty to one’s mother.
('16', 76, 3, 18, 181945) The harm done by this educa tion received through a foreign tongue does not stop here but goes much further.
('16', 76, 3, 19, 182054) It has created a gulf between the educated classes and the masses.
('16', 76, 3, 20, 182121) We do not know them and they do not know us.
('16', 76, 3, 21, 182166) They regard us as sahibs to be feared and may distrust us.

('16', 77, 1, 2, 182730) that the educated classes do not represent the common people would be true.
('16', 77, 1, 3, 182806) Fortunately, our educated classes appear to be awakening from their slumber.
('16', 77, 1, 4, 182883) Now that they are beginning to come in contact with the people, they themselves realize the handicaps described above.
('16', 77, 1, 5, 183002) How may they infect the people with their own enthusiasm?
('16', 77, 1, 6, 183060) English certainly will not avail us, whereas we have little or no aptitude to do the thing through Gujarati.
('16', 77, 1, 7, 183169) I always hear people say that they experience great difficulty in expressing themselves in the mother tongue.
('16', 77, 1, 8, 183279) This barrier dams up the current of popular life.
('16', 77, 1, 9, 183329) Macaulay’s 1
('16', 77, 2, 10, 183342) motive in introducing English education was sincere.
('16', 77, 2, 11, 183395) He despised our literature.
('16', 77, 2, 12, 183423) His contempt infected us, too, and we also lost our balance.
('16', 77, 2, 13, 183484) Indeed, we have left our masters, the English, far behind us in this matter.
('16', 77, 2, 14, 183561) Macaulay wanted us to become prop agandists of Western civilization among our masses.
('16', 77, 2, 15, 183647) His idea was that English education would help us to develop strength of character and then some of us would disseminate new ideas among the people.
('16', 77, 2, 16, 183796) It would be irrelevant here to consider whether or not those ideas were good enough to be spread among the people.
('16', 77, 2, 17, 183911) We have only to consider the question of the medium of instruction.
('16', 77, 2, 18, 183979) We saw in English education an opportunity to earn money and, therefore, gave importance to the use of English.
('16', 77, 2, 19, 184091) Some learned patriotism from it.
('16', 77, 2, 20, 184124) Thus the original idea became secondary and we suffered much harm from the use of English which extended beyond Macaulay’s original intention.
('16', 77, 3, 21, 184267) If we had political power in our hands, we would have discov ered the error soon enough and would have found it impossible to give up the mother tongue.
('16', 77, 3, 22, 184420) The officials did not give it up.
('16', 77, 3, 23, 184454) Many perhaps do not know that our court language is supposed to be Gujarati.
('16', 77, 3, 24, 184531) The Government gets the laws translated into Gujarati as well.
('16', 77, 3, 25, 184594) Speeches read at durbars are translated into Gujarati simult aneously.
('16', 77, 3, 26, 184665) We know that in currency notes Gujarati is used alongside with English.
('16', 77, 3, 27, 184737) Mathematical calculations which land surveyors have to learn are difficult.
('16', 77, 3, 28, 184813) If they had to do so through English, the work of the Revenue Department would have become very expensive.
('16', 77, 3, 29, 184920) So they evolved Gujarati terminology for the use of the surveyors.
('16', 77, 4, 30, 184987) 1 Thomas Babington Macaulay (1800 59); President of the General Committee of Public Instruction and Law Member of the Governor General’s Executive Council; recommended, in his Education Minute of February 2, 1835, the introduction of English education in India.

('16', 78, 1, 2, 185343) terms will give us a pleasant surprise.
('16', 78, 1, 3, 185383) If we have a sincere love for our language, we can this very moment put to use the resources at our disposal.
('16', 78, 1, 4, 185493) If lawyers start using Gujarati for their work, much of the clients’ money would be saved.
('16', 78, 1, 5, 185584) Clients would also get the requisite knowledge of law and come to know their rights.
('16', 78, 1, 6, 185669) The expenses on the services of interpreters would also be saved.
('16', 78, 1, 7, 185735) Legal terms would pass into current use.
('16', 78, 1, 8, 185776) Of course, lawyers would have to put themselves to some trouble to do all this.
('16', 78, 1, 9, 185856) I believe, and the belief is supported by experience, that this will not harm the interests of the client.
('16', 78, 1, 10, 185963) There is no reason to fear that arguments in Gujarati would carry less weight with the Court than in English.
('16', 78, 1, 11, 186073) It is compulsory for Collectors and other Government officials to know Gujarati.
('16', 78, 1, 12, 186154) But, because of our unreasoning craze for English, we allow their knowl edge to rust.
('16', 78, 2, 13, 186240) It has been contended that there was nothing wrong in our people learning English and using it for earning money and cultivating a sense of patriotism through it.
('16', 78, 2, 14, 186403) But the contention has no bearing on the use of English as the medium of instruction.
('16', 78, 2, 15, 186489) We shall respect a person who learns English for acquiring wealth or for doing good to the country.
('16', 78, 2, 16, 186589) But we cannot, on this account, assert that English should be used as the medium of instruction.
('16', 78, 2, 17, 186686) All that is intended here is to bring out the harmful consequences of English having established itself as the medium of education because of these two developments.
('16', 78, 2, 18, 186852) There are some who hold that English knowing people alone have displayed patriotism.
('16', 78, 2, 19, 186937) For the past two months, we have been witnessing something very different.
('16', 78, 2, 20, 187012) We may, however, accept this claim with the modification that others never had the opportunity which the English knowing people had.
('16', 78, 2, 21, 187145) The patriotism induced by the knowledge of English has not been infectious.
('16', 78, 2, 22, 187221) Real patriotism is an expanding force which is ever propagating itself.
('16', 78, 2, 23, 187293) The patriotism of English knowing people lacks this quality.
('16', 78, 2, 24, 187354) It is said that, however correct these arguments, the idea is not practicable today.
('16', 78, 2, 25, 187439) “It is a pity that the study of other subjects should have to suffer because of the excessive importance given to English.
('16', 78, 2, 26, 187562) And it is to be deplored that much of our mental energy is used up in mastering it.
('16', 78, 2, 27, 187646) But, in my humble opinion, the way we are placed in relation to English leaves us no alternative but to accept the present arrangement and then find a way out.” This is the view not of any ordinary writer but of one of the foremost scholars of Gujarat and a great lover of our mother tongue.
('16', 78, 2, 28, 187938) We cannot but take into account
('16', 79, 0, 1, 187970) 80 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 79, 1, 2, 188011) anything that Acharya Dhruva 1 says.
('16', 79, 1, 3, 188048) Few can claim to have the experience that he has.
('16', 79, 1, 4, 188098) He has rendered great service in the fields of education and literature.
('16', 79, 1, 5, 188171) He has a perfect right to advise and criti cize.
('16', 79, 1, 6, 188220) That being so, a man like me has to think twice before exp res sing a different opinion.
('16', 79, 1, 7, 188309) Shri Anandshankarbhai has expressed in courteous language the view held by the entire body of the advo cates of English.
('16', 79, 1, 8, 188430) We are in duty bound to give consideration to this point of view.
('16', 79, 1, 9, 188496) Besides, my position in respect of this is somewhat awkward.
('16', 79, 1, 10, 188557) I am conducting an experiment in National Education under his guidance and supenision.
('16', 79, 1, 11, 188644) In this experiment we are using the mother tongue as the medium of education.
('16', 79, 1, 12, 188722) In view of such close relations between us, I naturally hesitate to write anything in criticism of his views.
('16', 79, 1, 13, 188832) Fortunately, Acharya Dhruva has considered education through English and that through the mother tongue only as experiments and has not expressed any definite opinion about either.
('16', 79, 1, 14, 189013) I do not, therefore, feel as much hesitation in voicing my opposition to the above view as I otherwise would.
('16', 79, 2, 15, 189123) We attach excessive importance to our relationship with English.
('16', 79, 2, 16, 189188) I am aware that we cannot discuss this question with unrest ricted freedom in this Conference.
('16', 79, 2, 17, 189283) But it is not improper to tell even those who cannot take part in political affairs that the British rule in India should be for the good of our country.
('16', 79, 2, 18, 189437) There can be no other justification for it.
('16', 79, 2, 19, 189481) The British rulers themselves admit that for one nation to rule over another is an intolerable situation for both, that it is evil and harms both.
('16', 79, 2, 20, 189628) This is accepted in principle in discussions which recognize the altruistic point of view.
('16', 79, 2, 21, 189719) Therefore, if it is proved to the satisfaction of both the rulers and the ruled that education through English saps the mental energy of our people, then, no time should be lost in changing the medium of instruction.
('16', 79, 2, 22, 189936) The obstacles that lie in the way will then be a challenge to us.
('16', 79, 2, 23, 190002) If this view is accepted, it should not be necessary to give any further argument to convince those who, like Acharya Dhruva, admit the [present] drain on our mental energy.
('16', 79, 3, 24, 190176) I do not think it necessary to consider whether or not the adoption of the mother tongue as the medium of instruction will have any adverse effect on the knowledge of English.
('16', 79, 3, 25, 190352) It is not essential for all educated Indians to have a mastery of this alien language.
('16', 79, 3, 26, 190439) Not only
('16', 79, 4, 27, 190448) 1 Anandshankar Bapubhai Dhruva; Sanskrit scholar and man of letters; Vice Chancellor, Benares Hindu University, 1920 37

('16', 80, 1, 2, 190613) that, I even maintain, in all humility, that it is unnecessary to go out of one’s way to create the desire for such mastery.
('16', 80, 1, 3, 190738) It is true that some Indians will have to learn English.
('16', 80, 1, 4, 190795) Acharya Dhruva seems to have looked at this question only from the point of view of higher education.
('16', 80, 1, 5, 190897) If, however, we consider it from all angles, it will be seen that two classes of people will need to learn English: 1. Public spirited people who possess special aptitude for languages, have time on their hand and want to study English literature in order to put the fruits of their learning before our people, or use them in their contacts with the rulers.
('16', 80, 1, 6, 191255) 2. Those who want to use their knowledge of English for economic gain.
('16', 80, 1, 7, 191326) There is no harm in giving both these groups a thorough knowledge of English as an optional subject.
('16', 80, 1, 8, 191427) We should even provide the necessary facilities for it.
('16', 80, 1, 9, 191483) But in this arrangement the medium of instruction will be the mother tongue.
('16', 80, 1, 10, 191560) Acharya Dhruva fears that, if we do not adopt English as the medium but learn it merely as a foreign language, it will share the fate of Persian, Sanskrit, etc.
('16', 80, 1, 11, 191721) I must say, with due respect to the Acharya, that this view is not quite correct.
('16', 80, 1, 12, 191803) There are many Englishmen who know French well and are able to use it satisfactorily for their work even though they received their education through English.
('16', 80, 1, 13, 191962) In India, too, there are a number of Indians whose knowledge of French is quite good, though they learned it through the medium of English.
('16', 80, 1, 14, 192102) The truth is that, when English comes to occupy its own place and the mother tongue has gained its rightful status, our minds which are imprisoned at present will be set free from the prison house and, for brains which are well cultivated, well exercised and yet fresh, learning English will not be too much of a strain.
('16', 80, 1, 15, 192423) I even believe that the English we learn under such conditions will be more of a credit to us than it is at present.
('16', 80, 1, 16, 192540) What is more, with our intelligence vigorous and fresh, we shall be able to use it to better advantage.
('16', 80, 1, 17, 192644) From the practical point of view of gain and loss, the course proposed will be found effective in promoting all our interests.
('16', 80, 1, 18, 192771) When we start receiving education through our own language, our relations in the home will take on a different character.
('16', 80, 1, 19, 192893) Today, we cannot make our wives real life companions.
('16', 80, 1, 20, 192947) They have very little idea of what we do outside.
('16', 80, 1, 21, 192997) Our parents know nothing about what we learn at school.
('16', 80, 1, 22, 193053) If, however, we were to receive education through our mother tongue, we would find it easy to educate the washerman, the
('16', 81, 0, 1, 193174) 82 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 81, 1, 2, 193215) barber, the Bhangi 1 and others who serve us.
('16', 81, 1, 3, 193261) In England, they discuss politics with the hair dresser while having a hair cut.
('16', 81, 1, 4, 193342) Here, we cannot do so even with the members of our own families.
('16', 81, 1, 5, 193407) The reason is not that they are ignorant.
('16', 81, 1, 6, 193449) They, too, know as much as the English barber.
('16', 81, 1, 7, 193496) We talk with them on the Mahabharata, the Ramayana and of holy places, because it is these things which our people hear and learn about.
('16', 81, 1, 8, 193633) But, the knowledge we get at school does not seep down to others, not even to the members of our families, because we cannot impart to them what we learn in English.
('16', 81, 2, 9, 193799) At present the proceedings of our Legislative Assemblies are in English.
('16', 81, 2, 10, 193872) It is the same story with other bodies.
('16', 81, 2, 11, 193912) Consequently, the riches of our knowledge lie buried in the ground, much like the wealth of the miser.
('16', 81, 2, 12, 194015) The same thing happens in our courts of law.
('16', 81, 2, 13, 194060) The judges offer useful counsel.
('16', 81, 2, 14, 194093) Litigants are eager enough to know what they say, but they get to know nothing except the dry judgment at the end.
('16', 81, 2, 15, 194208) They cannot even follow the arguments of their lawyers.
('16', 81, 2, 16, 194264) It is the same with doctors, educated in schools through English.
('16', 81, 2, 17, 194330) They cannot educate the patients as may be required.
('16', 81, 2, 18, 194383) They do not even know the Gujarati names for the various parts of the body.
('16', 81, 2, 19, 194459) In consequence, most of them show no interest in their patients except to write out prescriptions for them.
('16', 81, 2, 20, 194567) It is said that, in our thoughtlessness, we allow huge masses of water flowing down the hills to go waste.
('16', 81, 2, 21, 194674) In the same way, we produce precious manure worth millions, but, in the result, we get only diseases.
('16', 81, 2, 22, 194776) Similarly, crushed under the weight of English and wanting in foresight, we fail to give our people what they are entitled to get.
('16', 81, 2, 23, 194907) This is no exaggeration.
('16', 81, 2, 24, 194932) It only expresses the intensity of my feeling on this point.
('16', 81, 2, 25, 194993) We shall have to pay heavily for our disregard of the mother tongue.
('16', 81, 2, 26, 195062) This has aIready done us great harm.
('16', 81, 2, 27, 195099) I consider it the first duty of the educated to save our masses from any further harrn on this account.
('16', 81, 3, 28, 195203) There can be no limit to the development of Gujarati, the language of Narasinh Mehta 2, the language in which Nandshankar wrote Karanghelo 3, which has been cultivated by writers like

('16', 82, 1, 3, 196145) What else can one expect of Gujaratis if they do not use such a language for their education?
('16', 82, 1, 4, 196239) The pity is that the point needs to be argued.
('16', 82, 1, 5, 196286) Finally, while bringing this topic to a close, I draw your attention to the articles of Dr. Pranjivandas Mehta on this subject.
('16', 82, 1, 6, 196414) Gujarati translations of these articles have been published and I suggest that you read them.
('16', 82, 1, 7, 196508) You will find in them many ideas which support these views.
('16', 82, 1, 8, 196568) If, now, we are convinced that it is good to adopt the mother tongue as the medium of instruc.tion, the next thing is to consider the steps to implement the decision.
('16', 82, 1, 9, 196735) Without going into any argument, I set down what these steps should be just in the order in which they occur to me: 1. English knowing Gujaratis should never, intentionally or inadvertently, use English among themselves.
('16', 82, 1, 10, 196956) 2. Those who possess a sound knowledge of both English and Gujarati should translate into Gujarati good and useful books or ideas in English.
('16', 82, 1, 11, 197098) 3. Societies for the promotion of education should get text books prepared.
('16', 82, 1, 12, 197174) 4. The rich among us should start schools in various places for imparting education through Gujarati.

('16', 83, 1, 2, 197985) 5. At the same time, various Conferences and Educational Associations should petition the Government for using the mother tongue as the sole medium of instruction.
('16', 83, 1, 3, 198149) Courts and legislatures should carry on their proceedings in Gujarati and people should also use Gujarati in all their work.
('16', 83, 1, 4, 198274) The prevailing practice of selecting only those who know English for lucrative posts should be changed and the candidates should be selected according to merit and without discrimination on the basis of language.
('16', 83, 1, 5, 198487) A petition should also go to the Government that schools be opened where Government servants may acquire the necessary knowledge of Gujarati.
('16', 83, 2, 6, 198629) Exception may be taken to this programme on one count.
('16', 83, 2, 7, 198684) It will be said that in the Legislative Assembly 1 there are Marathi, Sindhi and Gujarati members and, maybe, from Karnatak as well.
('16', 83, 2, 8, 198817) The difficulty is serious enough, but not insurmountable.
('16', 83, 2, 9, 198875) The Telugu speaking people have already raised this question and there is no doubt that some day there will have to be a reorganization of provinces on the basis of language.
('16', 83, 2, 10, 199050) But, meanwhile, members of the Assembly should have the right to speak either in Hindi or in their mother tongue.
('16', 83, 2, 11, 199164) If you find this suggestion ridiculous today; I need only say—with due respect to you—that most radical suggestions seem similarly ridiculous in the beginning and on a superficial view.
('16', 83, 2, 12, 199350) I am of the opinion that the progress of our country will largely depend on our deciding aright the question of the medium of education.
('16', 83, 2, 13, 199487) I think, therefore, that my suggestion is of great consequence.
('16', 83, 2, 14, 199551) When the mother tongue is better esteemed and has been restored to its rightful status—that of an official language—it will reveal powers and capacities undreamt of at present.
('16', 83, 3, 15, 199728) As we have had to consider the question of the medium of education, so also is it necessary to consider that of the national language.
('16', 83, 3, 16, 199863) If this is to be English, it must be made a compulsory subject.
('16', 83, 4, 17, 199927) Can English become our national language?
('16', 83, 4, 18, 199969) Some of our learned men, good patriots, contend that even to argue that English should become the national language betrays ignorance, that it is already so.
('16', 83, 4, 19, 200127) His Excellency the Viceroy 2 in his recent speech merely expressed the hope that it would occupy this place.

('16', 84, 1, 2, 200440) carry him as far as to say that it had already become our national language and that there could be no question about it.
('16', 84, 1, 3, 200562) He believes, however, that English will spread in the country day by day, enter our homes, and finally attain the exalted status of a national language.
('16', 84, 1, 4, 200715) On a superficial consideration, this view appears correct.
('16', 84, 1, 5, 200774) Looking at the educated section of our population, one is likely to gain the impression that, in the absence of English, all our work would come to a stop.
('16', 84, 1, 6, 200930) But deeper reflection will show that English cannot, and ought not to, become our national language.
('16', 84, 1, 7, 201031) Let us see what are the requirements of a national language:
('16', 84, 2, 8, 201092) 1. It should be easy to learn for Government officials.
('16', 84, 2, 9, 201148) 2. It should be capable of serving as a medium of religious, economic and political intercourse throughout India.
('16', 84, 2, 10, 201262) 3. It should be the speech of large numbers of Indians.
('16', 84, 2, 11, 201318) 4. It should be easy for every Indian to learn.
('16', 84, 2, 12, 201366) 5. In choosing such a language, considerations of temporary or passing circumstances should not count.
('16', 84, 3, 13, 201469) English does not fulfil any of these requirements.
('16', 84, 4, 14, 201520) The first point ought to have been placed last, but I have purposely reversed the order because it seems as though English fulfils it.
('16', 84, 4, 15, 201655) Closer examination will, however, show that even at the present moment it is not for officials an easy language to learn or handle.
('16', 84, 4, 16, 201787) The Constitution, under which we are being ruled, envisages that the number of British officials will progressively decrease until finally only the Viceroy and a few others are left here.
('16', 84, 4, 17, 201975) Even now, the majority of people in Government services are Indians and their number will increase as time passes.
('16', 84, 4, 18, 202090) I think no one will deny that for them English is more difficult than any Indian language.
('16', 84, 4, 19, 202181) As regards the second requirement, I think that religious intercourse through English is an impossibility unless our people throughout the land start speaking English.
('16', 84, 4, 20, 202349) Spreading English among the masses to this extent appears quite impossible.
('16', 84, 4, 21, 202425) English simply cannot satisfy the third requirement as it is not the speech of any very large number of Indians.
('16', 84, 4, 22, 202538) The fourth also cannot be met by English because it is not relatively an easy language for all our people to learn.
('16', 84, 4, 23, 202654) Considering the fifth point, we see that the status which English
('16', 85, 0, 1, 202720) 86 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 85, 1, 2, 202761) enjoys today is temporary; as a permanent arrangement, the position is that the need for English in national affairs will be, if at all, very slight.
('16', 85, 1, 3, 202911) It will be required for dealings with the British Empire and will remain the language of diplomacy between different countries within the Empire; this is a different matter.
('16', 85, 1, 4, 203085) It will certainly remain necessary for such purposes.
('16', 85, 1, 5, 203139) We do not grudge English anything.
('16', 85, 1, 6, 203174) We only want that it should not overstep its proper limits; this is all that we insist upon.
('16', 85, 1, 7, 203267) English will remain the imperial language and accordingly we shall require our Malaviyas, our Shastris and our Banerjeas to learn it, 1
('16', 85, 2, 8, 203403) confident that they will enhance the glory of India in other lands.
('16', 85, 2, 9, 203471) But English cannot be the national language of India.
('16', 85, 2, 10, 203525) To give it that position will be like introducing Esperanto into our country.
('16', 85, 2, 11, 203603) To think that English can become our national language betrays weakness, as the attempt to introduce Esperanto would betray sheer ignorance.
('16', 85, 2, 12, 203744) Which language, then, fulfils all the five requirements?
('16', 85, 2, 13, 203801) We shall have to admit that it is Hindi.
('16', 85, 2, 14, 203842) I call that language Hindi which Hindus and Muslims in the North speak and which is written either in Devanagari or Urdu script.
('16', 85, 2, 15, 203971) There has been some objection to this definition.
('16', 85, 2, 16, 204021) It is argued that Hindi and Urdu are two different languages.
('16', 85, 2, 17, 204083) But this is incorrect.
('16', 85, 2, 18, 204106) Both Hindus and Muslims speak the same language in North India.
('16', 85, 2, 19, 204170) The difference has been created by the educated classes.
('16', 85, 2, 20, 204227) That is, educated Hindus Sanskritize their Hindi with the result that Muslims cannot follow it.
('16', 85, 2, 21, 204323) Muslims of Lucknow Persianize their Urdu and make it unintelligible to Hindus.
('16', 85, 2, 22, 204402) To the masses both these languages are foreign and so they have no use for them.
('16', 85, 2, 23, 204483) I have lived in the North and have mixed freely with both Hindus and Muslims, and, though my knowledge of Hindi is limited; I have never found any difficulty in carrying on communication through it with them.
('16', 85, 2, 24, 204692) Therefore, call it Hindi or Urdu as you like, the language of the people in North India is the same thing—basically.
('16', 85, 2, 25, 204809) Write it in the Urdu script and call it Urdu, or write it in the Nagari script and call it Hindi.
('16', 85, 2, 26, 204907) There now remains the question of the script.
('16', 85, 2, 27, 204953) For the present, Muslims will certainly use the Urdu script and most of the Hindusthe Devanagari.
('16', 85, 2, 28, 205051) I say “most” because thousands of Hindus even today
('16', 85, 3, 29, 205103) 1 Madan Mohan Malaviya, Rt.
('16', 85, 3, 30, 205131) Hon’ble V. S. Srinivasa Sastri and Sir Surendranath Banerjea were pre eminent in their masterly use of the English language.

('16', 86, 1, 2, 205301) write in the Urdu script and some even do not know the Devanagari script.
('16', 86, 1, 3, 205375) In the end, when Hindus and Muslims will have ceased to regard each other with distrust, when the causes for such distrust have disappeared, the script which has greater range and is more popular will be more widely used and thus become the national script.
('16', 86, 1, 4, 205633) In the intervening period, Hindus and Muslims who desire to write their petitions in the Urdu script should be free to do so and these should be accepted at all Government offices.
('16', 86, 1, 5, 205814) No other language can compete with Hindi in satisfying these five requirements.
('16', 86, 1, 6, 205894) Next to Hindi comes Bengali.
('16', 86, 1, 7, 205923) But the Bengalis themselves make use of Hindi outside Bengal.
('16', 86, 1, 8, 205985) The Hindi speaking man speaks Hindi wherever he goes and no one feels surprised at this.
('16', 86, 1, 9, 206074) The Hindu preachers and the Mahomedan Moulvis always deliver their religious discourses in Hindi and Urdu and even the illiterate masses understand them.
('16', 86, 1, 10, 206228) Even an unlettered Gujarati, when he goes to the North, attempts to speak a few Hindi words, but the man from the North who works as gate keeper for the Bombay businessman declines to speak in Gujarati and it is the latter, his employer, who is obliged to speak to him in broken Hindi.
('16', 86, 1, 11, 206514) I have heard Hindi spoken even in far off Dravidian provinces 1. It is not correct to say that in Madras one needs English.
('16', 86, 1, 12, 206638) Even there, I have used Hindi for all my work.
('16', 86, 1, 13, 206685) In the trains, I have heard hundreds of Madrasi passengers speaking to others in Hindi.
('16', 86, 1, 14, 206773) Besides, the Muslims of Madras know good enough Hindi.
('16', 86, 1, 15, 206828) It should be noted that Muslims throughout India speak Urdu and they are found in large number in every province.
('16', 86, 1, 16, 206942) Thus Hindi has already established itself as the national language of India.
('16', 86, 1, 17, 207019) We have been using it as such for a long time.
('16', 86, 1, 18, 207066) The birth of Urdu itself is due to the aptness of Hindi for this purpose.
('16', 86, 1, 19, 207140) Muslim kings could not make Persian or Arabic the national language.
('16', 86, 1, 20, 207209) They accepted the Hindi grammar and, employing the Urdu script, used more Persian words.
('16', 86, 1, 21, 207298) They could not use a foreign tongue in their dealings with the masses.
('16', 86, 1, 22, 207369) It is not as if the British are unaware of this position.
('16', 86, 1, 23, 207427) Those who know anything about military affairs know that they have had to adopt Hindi and Urdu technical terms for use with the sepoys.
('16', 86, 1, 24, 207563) Thus, we see that Hindi alone can become our national language, though the matter presents some difficulty to the educated
('16', 86, 2, 25, 207686) 1 These constitute today the Southern States of Andhra, Kerala, Mysore and Madras, the home of people speaking languages of the Dravidian group.
('16', 87, 0, 1, 207831) 88 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 87, 1, 2, 207872) classes of Madras.
('16', 87, 2, 3, 207891) For Maharashtrians, Gujaratis, Sindhis and Bengalis, the thing is very easy.
('16', 87, 2, 4, 207968) In a few months they can acquire enough command of Hindi to be able to use it for all India intercourse.
('16', 87, 2, 5, 208073) It is not so easy for Tamil friends.
('16', 87, 2, 6, 208110) Tamil and other languages of the South belong to the Dravidian group.
('16', 87, 2, 7, 208180) The structure and the grammar of these languages are different from those of Sanskrit.
('16', 87, 2, 8, 208267) There is nothing in common between these two groups except certain words.
('16', 87, 2, 9, 208341) But the difficulty in learning Hindi is confined to the present educated classes only.
('16', 87, 2, 10, 208428) We are entitled to trust to their patriotic spirit and hope that they will make a special effort to learn Hindi.
('16', 87, 2, 11, 208541) As for the future, if Hindi attains its due status, it will be introduced in every school in Madras and there will be increased possibilities of contact between Madras and other provinces.
('16', 87, 2, 12, 208730) English has failed to reach the Dravidian masses, but Hindi will do so in no time.
('16', 87, 2, 13, 208813) The Telugu people have already started moving in this direction.
('16', 87, 2, 14, 208878) If this Conference reaches a decision on the question of the national language, we shall have to think of ways and means of implementing the decision.
('16', 87, 2, 15, 209029) The measures suggested for the promotion of the mother tongue could, with suitable modifications, be applied to the national language as well.
('16', 87, 2, 16, 209172) The difference is that the responsibility for making Gujarati the medium of instruction in our province will have to be shouldered mainly by us, whereas, in the movement to popularize the national language, the whole country will play its part.
('16', 87, 2, 17, 209417) We have discussed the question of the medium of instruction, the national language and, incidentally, the place of English.
('16', 87, 2, 18, 209541) We have now to consider whether there are any defects in the present system of education in the schools.
('16', 87, 3, 19, 209646) There is no difference of opinion on this point.
('16', 87, 3, 20, 209695) Both the Government and public opinion condemn the present system.
('16', 87, 3, 21, 209762) There are, however, differences of view regarding what aspects are fit to be preserved and what to be rejected.
('16', 87, 3, 22, 209874) I am not competent enough to discuss these differences.
('16', 87, 3, 23, 209930) I shall only venture to place before this Conference my own conclusions.
('16', 87, 4, 24, 210003) Since education is not exactly my sphere of work, I feel diffident in saying anything on this subject.
('16', 87, 4, 25, 210106) When I see a person talk about a thing of which he has no practical experience and which is, therefore, outside his range, I want to tell him off and grow impatient with him.
('16', 87, 4, 26, 210281) It would be natural for a lawyer to feel impatient and angry

('16', 88, 1, 2, 210387) with a physician talking of law.
('16', 88, 1, 3, 210420) In the same way, I hold that those who have no experience in the field of education have no right to offer criticism on matters connected with it.
('16', 88, 1, 4, 210567) I should, therefore, like to say a few words about my qualifications to speak on this subject.
('16', 88, 1, 5, 210662) I started thinking about modern education 1 twenty five years ago.
('16', 88, 1, 6, 210729) I had my children and the children of my brothers and sisters to look after.
('16', 88, 1, 7, 210806) I was aware of the defects in our schools.
('16', 88, 1, 8, 210849) I therefore carried out experiments on my children.
('16', 88, 1, 9, 210901) No doubt, I tossed them about a good deal in the process.
('16', 88, 1, 10, 210959) Some I sent to one place and some to others.
('16', 88, 1, 11, 211004) A few I taught myself.
('16', 88, 1, 12, 211027) My dissatisfaction with the prevailing system remained the same as ever even after I had left for South Africa, and I had to apply my mind further to the subject The management of the Indian Education Society 2 was in my hand for a long time.
('16', 88, 1, 13, 211270) I never sent my boys to school.
('16', 88, 1, 14, 211302) My eldest son was a witness to the different stages through which I passed.
('16', 88, 1, 15, 211378) He left me in disappointment and studied at a school in Ahmedabad for some time.
('16', 88, 1, 16, 211459) But, as he realized later, this did not benefit him particularly.
('16', 88, 1, 17, 211525) I am convinced that those whom I did not send to school have not stood to suffer and that they have received a good training indeed.
('16', 88, 1, 18, 211658) I am conscious of their deficiencies, but these are due to the fact that they grew up while my experiments were in their early stages and they were, therefore, victims of the modifications which the experiments went through despite the continuity of the general pattern.
('16', 88, 1, 19, 211929) During the satyagraha struggle in South Africa, there were fifty boys studying under my supervision.
('16', 88, 1, 20, 212030) 3 The general line of work in the school was laid down by me.
('16', 88, 1, 21, 212092) It had nothing in common with the system in vogue in Government or other schools.
('16', 88, 1, 22, 212174) A similar effort is now being made here and a National School 4 has been started in Ahmedabad with the blessings of Acharya Dhruva and other scholars.
('16', 88, 1, 23, 212325) It is now five months old.
('16', 88, 1, 24, 212352) Sankalehand Shah, formerly of the Gujarat College, is its Principal.
('16', 88, 1, 25, 212421) He received his education under Prof.
('16', 88, 1, 26, 212459) Gajjar and there are many other lovers of the language associated with him.

('16', 89, 1, 2, 213011) the responsibility for the scheme is mine, but it has the active approval of all the teachers connected with it.
('16', 89, 1, 3, 213124) They have dedicated themselves to the work, content to receive a salary just enough to meet their needs.
('16', 89, 1, 4, 213229) Though circumstances do not permit me to undertake actual teaching work in this school, its affairs constantly engage my attention.
('16', 89, 1, 5, 213361) Thus, my contribution is more like an amateur’s but, I believe, not altogether devoid of thought.
('16', 89, 1, 6, 213459) I would request you to keep this in mind in considering my criticism of the prevailing system of education.
('16', 89, 1, 7, 213567) It has always appeared to me that the present system of education pays no attention to the general pattern of life in our families.
('16', 89, 1, 8, 213699) Naturally enough, our needs were not taken into account when the scheme was drawn up.
('16', 89, 1, 9, 213785) Macaulay despised our literature.
('16', 89, 1, 10, 213819) He thought we were over much given to superstitions.
('16', 89, 1, 11, 213872) Most of those who drew up this scheme were utterly ignorant of our religion.
('16', 89, 1, 12, 213949) Some of them thought that it was a false religion.
('16', 89, 1, 13, 214000) Our scriptures were regarded as mere collections of superstitions.
('16', 89, 1, 14, 214067) Our civilization seemed full of defects to them.
('16', 89, 1, 15, 214116) Because we had fallen on evil times, it was thought that our institutions must be defective.
('16', 89, 1, 16, 214209) With the best of motives, therefore, they raised a faulty structure.
('16', 89, 1, 17, 214278) Since a fresh start was being made, the planners could only think of the immediate needs of the situation.
('16', 89, 1, 18, 214385) The whole thing was devised with this idea in mind, that the rulers would need lawyers, doctors, and clerks to help them and that the people should have the new knowledge.
('16', 89, 1, 19, 214557) Consequently, books were written without any regard for our way of living.
('16', 89, 1, 20, 214632) Thus, to use an English proverb, “The cart was placed before the horse”.
('16', 89, 1, 21, 214705) Shri Malabari said that, if History and Geography were to be taught to children, a beginning should be made with the history and geography of the home.
('16', 89, 1, 22, 214857) I remember, however, that I was made to memorize the counties of England, with the result that an interesting subject like geography became poison to me.
('16', 89, 1, 23, 215011) I found nothing in History to enthuse me.
('16', 89, 1, 24, 215053) History is a good means of inculcating patriotism.
('16', 89, 1, 25, 215104) But the way it was taught in the school gave me no reason to take pride in this country.
('16', 89, 1, 26, 215193) To learn that, I have had to read other books.
('16', 89, 1, 27, 215240) In teaching Arithmetic and other allied subjects, too, the traditional method hardly finds any place.
('16', 89, 1, 28, 215342) It is almost completely abandoned.
('16', 89, 1, 29, 215377) With the disappearance of the indigenous method of learning tables, we have lost the capacity for making speedy
('16', 90, 0, 1, 215489) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 91
('16', 90, 1, 2, 215534) calculations which our elders possessed.
('16', 90, 1, 3, 215575) Science tends to be dry and dull.
('16', 90, 1, 4, 215609) Our children cannot make much use of what they are taught in this field.
('16', 90, 1, 5, 215682) A science like astronomy which should be taught to the boys in the open by actually showing them the stars in the sky is taught through books.
('16', 90, 1, 6, 215825) I do not think many boys remernber how to decompose water into its constituent elements once they leave school.
('16', 90, 1, 7, 215937) As to Hygiene, it is no exaggeration to say that it is not taught at all.
('16', 90, 1, 8, 216011) We do not know, after 60 years of education, how to protect ourselves against epidemics like cholera and plague.
('16', 90, 1, 9, 216124) I consider it a very serious blot on the state of our education that our doctors have not found it possible to eradicate these diseases.
('16', 90, 1, 10, 216261) I have seen hundreds of homes.
('16', 90, 1, 11, 216292) I cannot say that I have found any evidence in them of a knowledge of hygiene.
('16', 90, 1, 12, 216371) I have the greatest doubt whether our graduates know what one should do in case one is bitten by a snake.
('16', 90, 1, 13, 216477) If our doctors could have started learning medicine at an earlier age, they would not make such a poor show as they do.
('16', 90, 1, 14, 216597) This is the disastrous result of the system under which we are educated.
('16', 90, 1, 15, 216670) People in almost all the parts of the world have managed to eradicate the plague.
('16', 90, 1, 16, 216752) Here it seems to have made a home and thousands of Indians die untimely deaths.
('16', 90, 1, 17, 216832) If this is to be attributed to poverty, it would still be up to the Education Department to answer why, even after 60 years of education, there is poverty in India.
('16', 90, 1, 18, 216997) Let us now turn our attention to the subjects which are not taught at all.
('16', 90, 1, 19, 217072) All education must aim at building character.
('16', 90, 1, 20, 217118) I cannot see how this can be done except through religion.
('16', 90, 1, 21, 217177) We are yet to realize that gradually we are being reduced to a state in which we shall have lost our own without having acquired the new.
('16', 90, 1, 22, 217315) I cannot go more into this, but I have met hundreds of teachers and they sighed in pain as they told me of their experiences.
('16', 90, 1, 23, 217441) This is an aspect which the Conference cannot but deeply ponder over.
('16', 90, 1, 24, 217511) If pupils in schools lose their character, everything will have been lost.
('16', 90, 1, 25, 217586) In our country, 85 to 90 per cent of people are engaged in agriculture.
('16', 90, 1, 26, 217658) Needless to say that no knowledge of this particular field of work can be too much.
('16', 90, 1, 27, 217742) And yet it has no place at all in the school syllabus up to the end of the high school education.
('16', 90, 1, 28, 217840) It is only in India that such an anomalous position can exist.
('16', 90, 1, 29, 217903) The weaving industry is also falling into ruin.
('16', 90, 1, 30, 217951) It provided work to farmers during their free hours.
('16', 90, 1, 31, 218004) The craft finds no place in the
('16', 91, 0, 1, 218036) 92 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 91, 1, 2, 218077) curriculum.
('16', 91, 1, 3, 218089) Our education can only produce clerks and, its general tendency being what it is, even goldsmiths, blacksmiths and cobblers, once they are caught up in its meshes, be come clerks.
('16', 91, 1, 4, 218269) We desire that everyone should have a good education.
('16', 91, 1, 5, 218323) But how will it profit us if our education makes us all clerks ?
('16', 91, 1, 6, 218388) Military science finds no place in our education.
('16', 91, 1, 7, 218438) Personally, I am not unhappy over this.
('16', 91, 1, 8, 218478) I even regard it as an accidental gain.
('16', 91, 1, 9, 218518) But the people want to learn the use of arms.
('16', 91, 1, 10, 218564) Those who do so should not be denied the opportunity of learning it.
('16', 91, 1, 11, 218633) But this science seems to have been completely lost sight of, as it were, in our scheme of education.
('16', 91, 1, 12, 218735) Nowhere do I find a place given to music.
('16', 91, 1, 13, 218777) It exercises a powerful influence over us.
('16', 91, 1, 14, 218820) We do not realize this vividly enough, otherwise we would have done everything possible to teach music to our boys and girls.
('16', 91, 1, 15, 218946) The Vedic hymns seem to follow musical tunes in their composition.
('16', 91, 1, 16, 219013) Harmonious music has the power to soothe the anguish of the soul.
('16', 91, 1, 17, 219079) At times, we find restlessness in a large gathering.
('16', 91, 1, 18, 219132) This can be arrested and calmed if a national song is sung by all.
('16', 91, 1, 19, 219199) That hundreds of boys may sing a poem full of courage and the spirit of adventure and bravery and be inspired with the spirit of heroism is no commonplace fact.
('16', 91, 1, 20, 219360) We have an example of the power of music in the fact that boatmen and other labourers raise, in unison, the cry of Harahar and Allabeli and this helps them in their work.
('16', 91, 1, 21, 219531) I have seen English friends trying to fight cold by singing songs.
('16', 91, 1, 22, 219598) Our boys learn to sing songs from popular plays in all manner of tunes and without regard to time and place, and try their hands on noisy harmoniums and Other instruments, and this does them harm.
('16', 91, 1, 23, 219795) If, instead, they were to be correctly trained in music, they would not waste their time singing, or attempting to sing, music hall songs.
('16', 91, 1, 24, 219934) Just as a trained singer never sings out of tune or at the wrong time, even so one who has learnt classical music will not go in for street music.
('16', 91, 1, 25, 220081) Music must get a place in our efforts at popular awakening.
('16', 91, 1, 26, 220141) The views of Dr. Ananda Coomaraswami 1 on this subject are worthy of serious study.
('16', 91, 1, 27, 220225) I include in the term “physical training” sports, games, etc.
('16', 91, 1, 28, 220287) These, too, have been little thought of.
('16', 91, 1, 29, 220328) Indigenous games have been given up and tennis, cricket and football hold sway.
('16', 91, 1, 30, 220408) Admit tedly, these games are enjoyable.
('16', 91, 1, 31, 220448) If, however, we had not been carried away by

('16', 92, 1, 2, 220689) enthusiasm for all things Western, we would not have given up our inexpensive but equally interesting games like gedi dado, gilli danda, kho kho, mag matali, kabaddi, kharo pat, nava nagelio, sat tali, etc.
('16', 92, 1, 3, 220896) Exercises which provided the completest training for every bodily organ and the old style gymnasium where they taught wrestling have almost totally disappeared.
('16', 92, 1, 4, 221057) I think if anything from the West deserves copying, it is drill.
('16', 92, 1, 5, 221122) A friend once remarked that we did not know how to walk, particularly when we had to walk in squads and keep step.
('16', 92, 1, 6, 221237) Silently to walk in step, by hundreds and thousands of us in twos and fours, shifting the directions from time to time is something we can never do.
('16', 92, 1, 7, 221386) It is not that such drill is useful only in actual battle.
('16', 92, 1, 8, 221445) It can be of great use in many other activities in the sphere of public service.
('16', 92, 1, 9, 221526) For example, in extinguishing fire, in rescuing people from drowning, in carrying the sick and disabled in a doli 1, etc., [previous practice in] drill is a valuable aid.
('16', 92, 1, 10, 221697) Thus, it is necessary to introduce in our schools indigenous games, exercises and the Western type of drill.
('16', 92, 2, 11, 221806) The education of women is as faulty as that of men.
('16', 92, 2, 12, 221858) No thought has been given to the relations of men and women or to the place of woman in Indian society.
('16', 92, 3, 13, 221962) Primary education for the two sexes can have much in common.
('16', 92, 3, 14, 222023) There are important differences at all other levels.
('16', 92, 3, 15, 222076) As Nature has made men and women different, it is necessary to maintain a difference between the education of the two.
('16', 92, 3, 16, 222195) True, they are equals in life, but their functions differ.
('16', 92, 3, 17, 222254) It is woman’s right to rule the home.
('16', 92, 3, 18, 222292) Man is master outside it.
('16', 92, 3, 19, 222318) Man is the earner, woman saves and spends.
('16', 92, 3, 20, 222361) Woman looks after the feeding of the child.
('16', 92, 3, 21, 222405) She shapes its future.
('16', 92, 3, 22, 222428) She is responsible for building its character.
('16', 92, 3, 23, 222475) She is her children’s educator, and hence, mother to the Nation.
('16', 92, 3, 24, 222540) Man is not father [in that sense].
('16', 92, 3, 25, 222575) After a certain period, a father ceases to influence his son; the mother never abdicates her place.
('16', 92, 3, 26, 222675) The son, even after attaining manhood, will play with the mother even as the child does.
('16', 92, 3, 27, 222764) He cannot do that with his father.
('16', 92, 4, 28, 222799) If this is the scheme of Nature, and it is just as it should be, woman should not have to earn her living.
('16', 92, 4, 29, 222906) A state of affairs in which women have to work as telegraph clerks, typists or compositors can be, I think, no good, such a people must be bankrupt and living on their capital.
('16', 92, 5, 30, 223083) 1 Seat slung from a pole carried by two or more men on shoulders
('16', 93, 0, 1, 223148) 94 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 93, 1, 2, 223189) Hence, just as, on the one hand, it is wrong to keep women in ignorance and under suppression, so, on the other, it is a sign of decadence and it is tyrannical to burden them with work which is ordinarily done by men.
('16', 93, 1, 3, 223407) There must be provision, therefore, for separate arrangements for the education of women after their attaining a certain age.
('16', 93, 1, 4, 223533) They should be taught the management of the home, the things they should or should not do during pregnancy, and the nursing and care of children.
('16', 93, 1, 5, 223679) Drawing up such a scheme presents difficulties.
('16', 93, 1, 6, 223727) The idea is new.
('16', 93, 1, 7, 223744) The right course would be to constitute a committee of men and women, of good character and well informed, who would think further and arrive at conclusions, and ask them to produce a suitable plan for the purpose.
('16', 93, 1, 8, 223959) This committee should consider measures for the education of girls from the time that they cease to be children.
('16', 93, 1, 9, 224072) There is, however, a very large number of girls who have been married off before puberty, and the number is increasing.
('16', 93, 1, 10, 224192) Once they are married, they just disappear from the field.
('16', 93, 1, 11, 224251) I have given my views on this in my foreword to the first book of the “Bhagini Samaj” series.
('16', 93, 1, 12, 224345) I reproduce them here: We shall not solve the problem of women’s education merely by educating girls.
('16', 93, 1, 13, 224447) Victims of child marriage, thousands of girls vanish from view at the early age of twelve.
('16', 93, 1, 14, 224538) They change into house wives!
('16', 93, 1, 15, 224568) Till this wicked custom has disappeared from among us, the husband will have to learn to be the wife’s teacher.
('16', 93, 1, 16, 224680) A great many of our hopes lie in women being educated on matters mentioned above.
('16', 93, 1, 17, 224762) It seems to me that unless women cease to be a mere means of pleasure or cooks to us and come to be our life companions, equal partners in the battle of life, sharers in our joys and sorrows, all our efforts are doomed to failure.
('16', 93, 1, 18, 224993) There are men to whom their women are no better than animals.
('16', 93, 1, 19, 225055) For, this sad state, some of the Sanskrit sayings and a well known doha 1 of Tulsidas may be held responsible.
('16', 93, 1, 20, 225166) Tulsidas says at one place: “The drum, the fool, the Sudra, the animal and the woman—all these need beating.” 2 I adore Tulsidasji, but adoration is not blind.
('16', 93, 1, 21, 225326) Either this couplet is an interpolation, or, if it is his, he must have
('16', 93, 2, 22, 225398) 1 Couplet 2 This is from Ramacharitamanas.
('16', 94, 0, 1, 225441) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 95
('16', 94, 1, 2, 225486) to the Sanskrit sayings, people seem to labour under the impression that every verse in that language was a scriptural precept.
('16', 94, 1, 3, 225614) We must fight this impression and pluck out from its very root the general habit of regarding women as inferior beings.
('16', 94, 1, 4, 225734) On the other hand, blinded by passion, many among us regard women as beautiful dolls to be adored as so many goddesses and decorate them with ornaments just as we have Thakorji 1 dressed up in new finery every few hours.
('16', 94, 1, 5, 225955) We must keep away from this evil also.
('16', 94, 1, 6, 225994) Ultimately, however, there can be salvation for us only when—and not until—our women become to us what Uma 2 was to Shankar 3, Sita to Rama and Damayanti to Nala, joining us in our deliberations, arguing with us, appreciating and nourishing our aspirations, understanding, with their marvellous intuition, the unspoken anxieties of our outward life and sharing in them, bringing us the peace that soothes.
('16', 94, 1, 7, 226400) This goal can hardly be achieved in the immediate future merely by starting girls’ schools.
('16', 94, 1, 8, 226492) As long as we have around our necks the noose of child marriage, men have to be teachers to their wives, and that not merely to make them literate.
('16', 94, 1, 9, 226640) Gradually, it should be possible to introduce women to the subjects of politics and social reform.
('16', 94, 1, 10, 226739) Literacy is not essential for this.
('16', 94, 1, 11, 226775) The man, in such a case, will have to change his attitude to his wife.
('16', 94, 1, 12, 226846) If a girl were treated as a pupil till she came of age, the husband observing brahmacharya the while, if we had not been pressed down by the weight of inertia, we would never subject a girl of twelve or fifteen to the agony of child bearing.
('16', 94, 1, 13, 227088) One ought to shudder at the very thought of it.
('16', 94, 1, 14, 227136) Classes are now conducted for married women and lectures arranged.
('16', 94, 1, 15, 227203) All this is good as far as it goes.
('16', 94, 1, 16, 227239) Those who are engaged in this work make a sacrifice of their time.
('16', 94, 1, 17, 227306) This is to the credit side.
('16', 94, 1, 18, 227334) It seems to me, however, that unless men simultaneously discharge the duty indicated above, these efforts will not produce much result.
('16', 94, 1, 19, 227470) A little reflection will show this to be self evident.
('16', 94, 1, 20, 227525) Wherever we look, we find heavy structures raised on weak foundations.
('16', 94, 1, 21, 227596) Those selected as teachers for primary education may in courtesy be termed so, but in doing this we, in fact, misuse this
('16', 94, 2, 22, 227718) 1 The idol or image of God 2 Parvati, spouse of Shiva 3 Shiva, one of the Hindu trinity of gods
('16', 95, 0, 1, 227814) 96 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 95, 1, 2, 227855) Childhood is the most important period of one’s life.
('16', 95, 1, 3, 227909) Knowledge received during this period is never forgotten.
('16', 95, 1, 4, 227967) But this is the period during which the child is allowed the least time [for learning] and is held prisoner in no matter what manner of school.
('16', 95, 1, 5, 228111) I hold that, in our equipping high schools and colleges, we incur expense which this poor land can hardly bear.
('16', 95, 1, 6, 228223) If, instead, primary education were to be given by well educated and experienced teachers of high character, in surroundings which would reflect some regard for the beauty of Nature and safeguard the health of the pupils, we would see good results in a short time We would not succeed in bringing about the desired change even if we double the monthly salaries of the present teachers.
('16', 95, 1, 7, 228609) Big results cannot be brought about through such small changes.
('16', 95, 1, 8, 228673) The very pattern of primary education must change.
('16', 95, 1, 9, 228724) I know that this is a difficult proposition and that there are several obstacles in the way.
('16', 95, 1, 10, 228817) All the same, it should not be beyond the power of the Gujarat Kelavani Mandal to find a solution to this problem.
('16', 95, 1, 11, 228932) I should, perhaps, say that it is not my intention to find fault with the teachers in primary schools.
('16', 95, 1, 12, 229035) That they are able to show results beyond their powers is, in my opinion, to be attributed to our noble culture and traditions.
('16', 95, 1, 13, 229163) I am sure that, given sufficient training and encouragement, these same teachers will show results of which we can have no conception at present.
('16', 95, 1, 14, 229309) I think it would be improper for me to say anything about the question, whether or not education should be free and compulsory.
('16', 95, 1, 15, 229437) My experience is limited.
('16', 95, 1, 16, 229463) Besides, the idea of imposing anything as duty on our people does not appeal to me and so I cannot reconcile myself to this addition to their obligations.
('16', 95, 1, 17, 229618) It will be more appropriate at present to make education free but optional and make experiments.
('16', 95, 1, 18, 229715) I visualize many difficulties in making education compulsory until we have left the days of autocracy behind us.
('16', 95, 1, 19, 229828) The experience of the Baroda Government may be of some help in coming to a decision on this matter.
('16', 95, 1, 20, 229928) My own investigation has led me to conclude against the advisability of compulsory education; but the investigation was not thorough and, therefore, no weight can be attached to it.
('16', 95, 1, 21, 230110) I hope some of the delegates to this Conference will throw helpful light on the point.
('16', 95, 2, 22, 230197) I am convinced that petitioning the Government is not the royal road for correcting all the foregoing deficiencies.
('16', 95, 2, 23, 230313) The Government cannot change things radically in a day.
('16', 95, 2, 24, 230369) It is for leaders of the people
('16', 96, 0, 1, 230401) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 97
('16', 96, 1, 2, 230446) road for correcting all the foregoing deficiencies.
('16', 96, 1, 3, 230498) The Government cannot change things radically in a day.
('16', 96, 1, 4, 230554) It is for leaders of the people to take the initiative in such ventures.
('16', 96, 1, 5, 230627) The British Constitution leaves particular scope for such initiative.
('16', 96, 1, 6, 230697) If we think that anything can be done only if the Government moves, we are not likely to realize our aims for ages.
('16', 96, 1, 7, 230813) As they do in England, we must first make experiments and show results before asking the Government to adopt new measures.
('16', 96, 1, 8, 230936) Whoever finds a deficiency in any field can try to correct it by his own efforts and, after he has succeeded, can move the Government for the desired improvement.
('16', 96, 1, 9, 231099) For such pioneering ventures, it is necessary to establish a number of special educational bodies.
('16', 96, 1, 10, 231198) There is one great obstacle in the way—the lure of degrees.
('16', 96, 1, 11, 231258) We think our entire life depends on success at examinations.
('16', 96, 1, 12, 231319) This results in great harm to the people.
('16', 96, 1, 13, 231361) We forget that a degree is useful only for those who want to go in for Government service.
('16', 96, 1, 14, 231452) But the edifice of national life is not to be raised on the salaried class.
('16', 96, 1, 15, 231528) We also see that people are able to earn money quite well even without taking up any service.
('16', 96, 1, 16, 231622) When those who are almost illiterate can become millionaires by their intelligence and shrewdness, there is no reason why the educated cannot do the same.
('16', 96, 1, 17, 231777) If the educated would only give up their fear, they could be as capable as the unlettered.
('16', 96, 1, 18, 231868) If this lure of degrees could be shaken off, any number of private schools could flourish.
('16', 96, 1, 19, 231959) No government can provide fully for all the education which the people need.
('16', 96, 1, 20, 232036) In America, education is mostly a private enterprise.
('16', 96, 1, 21, 232090) In England, too, private enterprise runs a number of institutions.
('16', 96, 1, 22, 232157) They give their own certificates.
('16', 96, 1, 23, 232191) It will require Herculean efforts to put our education on a sound foundation.
('16', 96, 1, 24, 232269) We shall have to make sacrifices and dedicate ourselves body, mind and soul to the task.
('16', 96, 1, 25, 232358) I think there is not much that we can learn from America, but one thing we would do well to copy.
('16', 96, 1, 26, 232456) Some of the biggest educational institutions there are run by a huge Trust.
('16', 96, 1, 27, 232532) Wealthy Americans have donated millions to this Trust.
('16', 96, 1, 28, 232587) It runs a number of private schools.
('16', 96, 1, 29, 232624) If it has a huge fund, it also has at its disposal the services of a number of learned men who love their country and are well equipped physically.
('16', 96, 1, 30, 232772) They inspect all these institutions and help them in maintaining academic standards.
('16', 96, 1, 31, 232857) They provide help wherever and in whatever measure they think necessary.
('16', 96, 1, 32, 232930) It is available to any
('16', 97, 0, 1, 232953) 98 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 97, 1, 2, 232994) institution which agrees to adopt the approved constitution.
('16', 97, 1, 3, 233055) An enthusiastic campaign launched by this Trust carried the results of new researches in the field of agriculture to elderly peasants.
('16', 97, 1, 4, 233190) We can have a similar plan in Gujarat.
('16', 97, 1, 5, 233229) There is wealth here and scholarship, too, and love of religion has not altogether disappeared.
('16', 97, 1, 6, 233325) Children are only waiting to be taught.
('16', 97, 1, 7, 233365) If we can take up this venture, we may show to the Government in a few years that our efforts are in the right direction.
('16', 97, 1, 8, 233487) I am sure the Government, then, will not fail to adopt the plan.
('16', 97, 1, 9, 233552) Actual work will speak to better effect than a thousand petitions This suggestion covers the other two objects of the Gujarat Kelavani Mandal.
('16', 97, 1, 10, 233695) The establishment of such a Trust will ensure both a continuous campaign for the spread of education and also practical work in that field.
('16', 97, 1, 11, 233835) This done, everything else will follow.
('16', 97, 1, 12, 233875) Evidently, therefore, it will not be easy work.
('16', 97, 1, 13, 233923) Wealthy people are like the Government, in that they wake up only when we prod them.
('16', 97, 1, 14, 234008) For this, tapascharya is the only means we have.
('16', 97, 1, 15, 234057) It is the first and last step in dharma.
('16', 97, 1, 16, 234098) I take it that the Gujarat Kelavani Mandal is the embodiment of such tapascharya.
('16', 97, 1, 17, 234180) When its secretaries and members are wholly possessed by the spirit of service and are also men of learning, money will pour forth on its own.
('16', 97, 1, 18, 234323) Moneyed people are always sceptical.
('16', 97, 1, 19, 234360) They have reason to be so.
('16', 97, 1, 20, 234387) Therefore, if we want to please the goddess of wealth, we shall have first to prove our fitness.
('16', 97, 1, 21, 234484) Though we shall need plenty of money, we need not stress the matter overmuch.
('16', 97, 1, 22, 234562) Anyone who would work for the spread of national education will, if uneducated, teach himself as he goes about his daily labour and then, sitting beneath a tree, teach those who want to learn.
('16', 97, 1, 23, 234755) This is the way of the Brahmin dharma.
('16', 97, 1, 24, 234794) Anyone who chooses may follow it.
('16', 97, 1, 25, 234828) When we have such Brahmins, both wealth and power will bow in reverence before them.
('16', 97, 1, 26, 234913) I want the Gujarat Kelavani Mandal to have such unshakable faith; may God grant that it have.
('16', 97, 1, 27, 235007) In education lies the key to swaraj.
('16', 97, 1, 28, 235044) Let political leaders wait on Mr. Montagu 1, if they want to.
('16', 97, 1, 29, 235106) It does not matter if politics is out of bounds for this Conference.
('16', 97, 1, 30, 235175) But the fact remains that all efforts are futile without the right kind of education, which is the special concern

('16', 98, 4, 7, 235757) [After October 20, 1917] 1
('16', 98, 5, 8, 235784) BHAI MAGANLAL, I have your letter.
('16', 98, 5, 9, 235819) I leave the decision about Guruprasad to you.
('16', 98, 5, 10, 235865) If you feel that he is really patriotic and can live on in the Ashram without quarrelling with anyone, and that he does the work assigned to him sincerely, I see no objection to sending him anything up to Rs.10. But do that on your responsibility.
('16', 98, 5, 11, 236113) I do not want it to happen that I take a step and you suffer the consequence.
('16', 98, 5, 12, 236191) I did not think that we would have to send him anything, nor did I know anything about his needs.
('16', 98, 5, 13, 236289) All the same, we can accommodate a worthy person.
('16', 98, 5, 14, 236339) Vrajlalbhai keeps fit enough.
('16', 98, 5, 15, 236369) Fulchand must have recovered.
('16', 98, 5, 16, 236399) Ask him to write to me about his wife’s condition also.
('16', 98, 5, 17, 236455) Ask Sankalehand to send me at once translation of the speech at the Educational Conference.

('16', 98, 9, 20, 236639) 39. SCHEME FOR NATIONAL EDUCATION 2
('16', 98, 10, 21, 236675) For many years past, several friends and I have felt that our present education is not national and that, in consequence, people do not get from it the benefit they ought to.
('16', 98, 10, 22, 236850) Our children languish as a result of this education.
('16', 98, 10, 23, 236903) They become incapable of any great achievement and the knowledge they acquire does not spread among
('16', 98, 11, 24, 237003) 1 The speech at the Educational Conference referred to in the letter was delivered on October 20; vide the preceding item.
('16', 98, 12, 25, 237126) 2 This article, which appeared as by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, is an ela boration of his earlier article: “National Gujarati School”, vide”National Gujarati School”, After 18 1 1917.
('16', 99, 0, 1, 237311) 100 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 99, 1, 2, 237353) the masses—not even among their families.
('16', 99, 1, 3, 237395) Nor do the young people have any aim in mind in taking this modern education except to get a job and make money
('16', 99, 2, 4, 237507) Anandshankar Bapubhai Dhruva writes:
('16', 99, 3, 5, 237544) As, during the last five years or so, India stirred out of her sleep and
('16', 99, 4, 6, 237617) opened her eyes, she found herself faced with the problem of her education.
('16', 99, 5, 7, 237693) The people of India want to have a share in their government and, to be sure,
('16', 99, 6, 8, 237771) they will get it.
('16', 99, 6, 9, 237789) Are three quarters of her population, then, to remain
('16', 99, 7, 10, 237843) condemned to illiteracy?
('16', 99, 7, 11, 237868) They are to pledge themselves to the use of swadeshi
('16', 99, 8, 12, 237921) Is their education, then, to remain without due provision for
('16', 99, 9, 13, 237983) instruction in commerce and industry?
('16', 99, 9, 14, 238021) India will become conscious of her self 
('16', 99, 10, 15, 238062) respect; is she to be content, then, to have her ancient literature and her arts,
('16', 99, 11, 16, 238144) her religions and her philosophy, expounded always by foreign scholars ?
('16', 99, 12, 17, 238217) These and other like aspirations for a fuller life, along with the changed
('16', 99, 13, 18, 238292) circumstances, have invested the problem of education at the present day with
('16', 99, 14, 19, 238370) especial importance and till, recognizing the seriousness of this all important
('16', 99, 15, 20, 238450) issue, we firmly adhere to certain principles as fundamental to our education,
('16', 99, 16, 21, 238529) we shall not have done our duty by ourselves and our country, in fact, by the
('16', 99, 17, 22, 238607) humanity in us.
('16', 99, 18, 23, 238623) And again:
('16', 99, 19, 24, 238634) Social reform and religion seemed to be quite simple matters to the leaders of
('16', 99, 20, 25, 238713) that generation, but the threads which go into the making of a religious life
('16', 99, 21, 26, 238791) are many coloured and closely inter twined.
('16', 99, 21, 27, 238835) Hindu society derives its vitality
('16', 99, 22, 28, 238870) from its recognition of these two facts.
('16', 99, 22, 29, 238911) It is the duty of the new age to
('16', 99, 23, 30, 238944) understand this truth and order its life accordingly.
('16', 99, 23, 31, 238998) The system of education in
('16', 99, 24, 32, 239025) vogue in the last generation was defective as it limited itself to turning out
('16', 99, 25, 33, 239104) government servants, lawyers and doctors.
('16', 99, 26, 34, 239146) Wherever I have travelled in India, I have discussed this question with the leaders and, without exception, everyone has admitted that our educational system must change.
('16', 99, 26, 35, 239317) The following extract makes it quite clear that the Government did not consider all the needs of the people in devising this system:
('16', 99, 27, 36, 239450) We have, moreover, looked upon the encouragement of education as peculiarly
('16', 99, 28, 37, 239526) important, because it is calculated not only to produce a higher degree of
('16', 99, 29, 38, 239601) intellectual fitness, but to raise the moral character of those who partake of its
('16', 100, 0, 1, 239684) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 101
('16', 100, 1, 2, 239730) advantages and so to supply you with servants to whose probity you may,
('16', 100, 2, 3, 239802) with increased confidence, commit offices of trust in India.
('16', 100, 3, 4, 239863) It is one of the recognized principles of education that it should be planned with a view to the needs of the people.
('16', 100, 3, 5, 239981) This idea finds no place at all in our schools.
('16', 100, 3, 6, 240029) The system of education has to change, but to look to the Government for this will be sheer waste of time.
('16', 100, 3, 7, 240136) The Government will wait on public opinion and, being foreign, move very timidly; it cannot understand our needs, its advisers may be ill informed or they may have interests of their own to serve.
('16', 100, 3, 8, 240333) For a variety of such reasons, it will probably be quite long before there is any serious change in the present system; the time that passes meanwhile, is so much loss to the people.
('16', 100, 3, 9, 240516) It is, however, not intended to suggest here that we should not try to get the Government to move.
('16', 100, 3, 10, 240615) Let petitions be made to it and let public opinion be ascertained.
('16', 100, 3, 11, 240682) But the best petition to the Government will be an actual demonstration by us and this will also be the easiest way of cultivating public opinion.
('16', 100, 3, 12, 240829) It has accordingly been decided, in consultation with some educated gentlemen, to start a national school.
('16', 100, 3, 13, 240936) EDUCATION IN THE SCHOOL Education in the school will be entirely through the mother tongue.
('16', 100, 3, 14, 241028) It is surprising that, while among other nations the mother tongue enjoys pride of place, among us this place belongs to English.
('16', 100, 3, 15, 241158) This state of affairs is ultimately harmful to the people.
('16', 100, 3, 16, 241217) The President of the first Gujarat Educational Conference, too, expressed the view that the medium of education should be the mother tongue.
('16', 100, 3, 17, 241358) The Chairman of the Reception Committee was very emphatic in his speech that education should be through the mother tongue.
('16', 100, 3, 18, 241482) The matter was specifically mentioned in the Government dispatch of 1854. It is not easy to understand how, in spite of that, the basis of education was altered.
('16', 100, 3, 19, 241644) The dispatch said:
('16', 100, 4, 20, 241663) It is neither our aim nor our desire to substitute the English for the vernacular dialects of the country.
('16', 100, 4, 21, 241770) We have always been most sensible of the importance of the use of the languages, which alone are understood by the great mass of the population.
('16', 100, 4, 22, 241915) These languages, not English, have been, put by us in the place of Persian in the administration of justice and in the intercourse between the officers of the Government and the people.
('16', 100, 4, 23, 242101) It is indispensable, therefore,
('16', 100, 5, 24, 242133) 1 This and the subsequent quotations are English passages as quoted by Gandhiji in footnotes in the original Gujarati version of this article.
('16', 101, 0, 1, 242276) 102 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 101, 1, 2, 242318) that in any general system of education, the studio of vernaculars should be assiduously attended to.
('16', 101, 1, 3, 242420) And any acquaintance with improved European knowledge which is to be communicated to the great mass of the people whose circumstances prevent them from acquiring a high standard of knowledge and who cannot be expected to overcome the difficulty of a foreign language, can only be conveyed to them through one or other of these vernacular languages.
('16', 101, 1, 4, 242769) We look, therefore to the English language and the vernacular languages of India together as media for the diffusion of European knowledge, and it is our desire to see them cultivated in all schools in India of a sufficiency high class to maintain a school master possessing the requisite qualifications.
('16', 101, 1, 5, 243074) His Excellency Lord Chelmsford, the Viceroy, also gave an idea, in his address to the Conference of Directors [of Education] held in Delhi on February 22, of the harm that has resulted from English instead of the mother tongue having been assigned the chief place.
('16', 101, 1, 6, 243339) He asked where the British people would have been if they had had to receive their education through a foreign tongue.
('16', 101, 1, 7, 243458) His own reply was that many Britons would have given up their studies in sheer despair.
('16', 101, 1, 8, 243546) He described the present method of imparting education through English as a “vicious system” 1. These are his words:
('16', 101, 2, 9, 243663) I refer to the relative claims of English and vernacular teaching.
('16', 101, 2, 10, 243730) At the present moment, we rely on English as the medium of higher instruction.
('16', 101, 2, 11, 243809) This is due mainly to the fact that English is the passport to employment and that vernacular text books are not available, but the consequence is obvious.
('16', 101, 2, 12, 243965) Students endeavour to grapple with abstruse subjects through the medium of a foreign tongue and in many cases, thanks to their mediocre acquaintance with that tongue, have perforce to memorize their text books.
('16', 101, 2, 13, 244176) We criticize adversely this tendency to memorize but to my mind it reflects credit on the zeal of the student who, rather than abandon their quest for knowledge, memorize whole pages, whole books which they understand but imperfectly.
('16', 101, 2, 14, 244411) This is, of course, a mere travesty of education....I would ask you and myself as University men how should we have fared in our education if it had been wholly through the medium of a foreign tongue.
('16', 101, 2, 15, 244612) I doubt whether we would [not] have abandoned the attempt in despair; and I am lost in admiration for the gift of those boys who made a gallant attempt to surmount the difficulties imposed on them by a vicious system.
('16', 101, 2, 16, 244830) An attempt has been made in Poona to impart education through an Indian language, and, in the view of those who run the
('16', 101, 3, 17, 244950) 1 Gandhiji uses the English expression,
('16', 102, 0, 1, 244990) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 103
('16', 102, 1, 2, 245036) school, the result has been good.
('16', 102, 1, 3, 245070) This view is shared by the Government and the public; we, too, aim at providing education through the mother tongue.
('16', 102, 1, 4, 245187) The President of the first [Gujarat] Educational Conference had pointed out in his speech that, if the mother tongue was adopted as the medium of instruction, it would require seven years to impart the knowledge which at present requires 11 years in the High School.
('16', 102, 1, 5, 245454) This is no insignificant saving.
('16', 102, 1, 6, 245487) The most important advantage of such a policy would be the reduction in the financial burden on the people.
('16', 102, 2, 7, 245595) Hindi has been included in the curriculum of this school for the simple reason that it is spoken by about 220 million people.
('16', 102, 2, 8, 245721) If a language spoken by such large numbers of our countrymen can be taught [to the rest], they would all find it easy to understand the meaning of the various political movements.
('16', 102, 2, 9, 245901) I am convinced that, in India, Hindi alone can occupy the position of a national language.
('16', 102, 2, 10, 245992) It has a fine literature, too, and will therefore enrich our literatures.
('16', 102, 2, 11, 246066) The schools under the present dispensation make no provision for teaching the science of religion.
('16', 102, 2, 12, 246165) It has been given a place in the curriculum of this school.
('16', 102, 3, 13, 246225) The pupils here will be trained in two occupations: (1) agriculture and (2) weaving.
('16', 102, 3, 14, 246310) Incidental to these, they will get training in carpentry and smithy.
('16', 102, 3, 15, 246379) They will also receive instruction in Physics, Chemistry, Botany and Zoology.
('16', 102, 3, 16, 246457) In India, the foregoing occupations occupy the most important place and anyone who learns them will never have to go in search of a job.
('16', 102, 4, 17, 246594) Every pupil will be taught the means of preserving health and home remedies for common ailments.
('16', 102, 4, 18, 246691) The pupil’s physical training will receive no less attention than the education of his mind.
('16', 102, 5, 19, 246784) Every pupil will be taught five languages: (1) Gujarati (2) Hindi (3) Marathi (4) Sanskrit and (5) English.
('16', 102, 6, 20, 246892) Mathematics will include Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry and Trigonometry.
('16', 102, 6, 21, 246965) In other words, the pupils will be brought up to the level of the present First Year of the College.
('16', 102, 6, 22, 247066) History Geography: The history to be taught will be of Gujarat, India, England, Greece, Rome, and of modern times.
('16', 102, 6, 23, 247181) During the last year, Philosophy of History and Sociology will also be taught.
('16', 102, 6, 24, 247260) In Geography, the standard will not be inferior to what obtains in the schools at present.
('16', 103, 0, 1, 247351) 104 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 103, 1, 2, 247393) In Astronomy, the elements of the subjects will be taught.
('16', 103, 1, 3, 247452) A study of Economics is also essential and will, accordingly, be provided for.
('16', 103, 1, 4, 247531) Some knowledge of law is useful to every person and provision will, therefore, be made for teaching it for practical purposes.
('16', 103, 1, 5, 247658) Drill has been introduced in the first year to provide recreation and exercise to the pupils.
('16', 103, 1, 6, 247752) Music has been introduced as an aid to recitation and also that one may understand something of the subject.
('16', 103, 1, 7, 247861) All instruction in the first year will be oral.
('16', 103, 1, 8, 247909) Such general knowledge as will help in the development of the child’s mind, it is intended to convey to it as it plays about.
('16', 103, 1, 9, 248035) Knowledge of colours, shapes, size, etc., can be conveyed in this way and, so conveyed, it will stimulate the child’s powers of observation.
('16', 103, 1, 10, 248176) Hence this aid to education will also be utilized as an integral part of the method.
('16', 103, 1, 11, 248261) India never knew the institution of examinations.
('16', 103, 1, 12, 248311) The method is of recent introduction.
('16', 103, 1, 13, 248349) It received no great importance in the dispatch of 1854. The system has lent itself to serious abuse, every subject being taught with an eye on the examination and the conviction firmly planted in the pupil’s mind that passing the examination was all that was necessary.
('16', 103, 1, 14, 248620) The teacher, too, has got into the habit of doing his work in the same spirit, as so much drudgery.
('16', 103, 1, 15, 248720) Hence any knowledge that is acquired is superficial.
('16', 103, 1, 16, 248773) Not a single subject is taught with thoroughness.
('16', 103, 1, 17, 248823) The following passage is worth quoting in this context:
('16', 103, 2, 18, 248879) In recent years, they [examinations] have grown to extravagant dimension and their influence has been allowed to dominate the whole system of education in India with the result that instruction is confined to the rigid frame of prescribed courses, that all forms of training which do not admit of being tested by a written examination are liable to be neglected, and that most teachers and pupils are tempted to concentrate their energies not so much on genuine study as upon questions likely to be set by the examiner.
('16', 103, 2, 19, 249399) Having regard to the view that examinations are quite undesirable, pupils in this institution will be tested periodically from two points of view—whether the teacher has made the right effort and whether the pupil has followed.
('16', 103, 2, 20, 249627) The pupil will be freed from the fear of examinations.
('16', 103, 2, 21, 249682) The tests will be held by the teachers of the school and by others familiar with the institution.
('16', 103, 2, 22, 249780) The expectation is that a pupil who has attended the school for ten years will be as well
('16', 104, 0, 1, 249870) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 105
('16', 104, 1, 2, 249916) equipped as the present day graduate.
('16', 104, 1, 3, 249954) In addition, he will have a practical knowledge of agriculture and weaving.
('16', 104, 1, 4, 250030) The use to which the student puts his abilities after leaving school will be the true measure of the worth of his education.
('16', 104, 1, 5, 250155) Every opportunity will be taken to rid his mind of the fallacious notion that the aim of education is to get employment.
('16', 104, 1, 6, 250276) At present, it is the general practice among business men to select for the better posts men who know English, and that from among those educated under the Government controlled system.
('16', 104, 1, 7, 250462) But they will have an alternative field for selection when scholars of this school go out on the completion of their studies.
('16', 104, 1, 8, 250588) The people will then have some idea of the effectiveness of the method of education followed here.
('16', 104, 1, 9, 250687) A businessman is not in love with a “degree”; his choice will fall on the efficient man.
('16', 104, 1, 10, 250776) If, after ten years of study, anyone wants to pursue a subject further, necessary arrangements for the purpose are left to the future.
('16', 104, 1, 11, 250911) EDUCATION FREE No fees will be charged in this school, the expenses being met from donations received.
('16', 104, 2, 12, 251014) TEACHERS Paid teachers will be engaged and will be, all of them, grownup men who have reached the college level or possess equivalent attainments.
('16', 104, 2, 13, 251161) The idea is that children should have the best teachers in the early stages.

('16', 104, 7, 18, 251343) I have been thanked already.
('16', 104, 7, 19, 251372) Never and nowhere could I express all that I feel.
('16', 104, 7, 20, 251423) It is services such as these which, I believe, lead to moksha 2. For these three days, I have been extremely happy.
('16', 104, 7, 21, 251539) I am thankful to Mr. Haribhai, for day and night he has been busy serving everyone.
('16', 104, 7, 22, 251623) If anyone has been dissatisfied with him, I apologize to him

('16', 105, 1, 2, 251840) on Mr. Haribhai’s behalf.
('16', 105, 1, 3, 251866) From a milch cow you may even bear a kick.
('16', 105, 1, 4, 251909) I am in love with the mother tongue, crazy over it.
('16', 105, 1, 5, 251961) I think we just cannot get on without it, can hope for no progress.
('16', 105, 1, 6, 252029) It is for this reason that I urge its claims wherever I go.
('16', 105, 1, 7, 252089) Seeing that my pleas have been of some avail here, I offer my thanks to you.
('16', 105, 1, 8, 252166) Why should you thank me ?
('16', 105, 1, 9, 252192) If, nonetheless, you do, I shall have no patience to hear what you say.
('16', 105, 1, 10, 252264) I hope the various committees will carry out what they have been charged with.
('16', 105, 1, 11, 252343) All obstacles must yield to determined human effort.
('16', 105, 1, 12, 252396) I am sorry that, for want of time, I have not been able to meet the wishes of the audience for a long speech.
('16', 105, 1, 13, 252506) I thank you all, sisters and brothers.
('16', 105, 1, 14, 252545) Only if I die for India shall I know that I was fit to live.

('16', 105, 4, 18, 252693) BROACH, October 21, 1917
('16', 105, 5, 19, 252718) Ever since I came to know Mr. Anandashankar Dhruva, I have been all admiration for him.
('16', 105, 5, 20, 252806) He is a priceless jewel of Gujarat; perhaps, the latter has not yet fully recognized his greatness.
('16', 105, 5, 21, 252906) When he was elected President, I saw that this body knew its own worth too.
('16', 105, 5, 22, 252982) Mr. Dhruva has proved to the entire Hindu world that the supreme virtue of non violence has been accepted by all in India.
('16', 105, 5, 23, 253105) Jainism and Hinduism are not so different as to justify our treating them as distinct religions.
('16', 105, 5, 24, 253202) The religion named after Gautam Buddha cherishes the same ideals as Hinduism.
('16', 105, 5, 25, 253280) Mr. Dhruva is a jewel not only of Gujarat but of the whole of India.
('16', 105, 5, 26, 253349) The rest of India does not know him because he has not come out into public life in Gujarat.
('16', 105, 5, 27, 253442) He is a scholar of great distinction.
('16', 105, 5, 28, 253480) I could see his scholarship even from his speeches.
('16', 105, 5, 29, 253532) Practical ability such as his is very necessary in the affairs of this world.
('16', 105, 5, 30, 253610) I have had much experience of these affairs and gone through a great deal.
('16', 105, 5, 31, 253685) It was a pleasure to me to listen to his sincere words and I would simply love to be in his company.
('16', 105, 6, 32, 253786) 1 Gandhiji spoke on the second day of the Conference, while proposing vote of thanks to the President, A. B. Dhruva.
('16', 106, 0, 1, 253903) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 107
('16', 106, 1, 2, 253949) Mr. Dhruva is a hidden jewel.
('16', 106, 1, 3, 253979) He is well informed about ancient and modern Hindu society.
('16', 106, 1, 4, 254039) For the present generation, which is growing up in luxuries and building castles in the air and is, in its thoughtlessness, carried away by the flood of all these notions of reform, Mr. Dhruva is like a boat, a leader taking them back to the right place.
('16', 106, 1, 5, 254294) Old men can value a flower aright.
('16', 106, 1, 6, 254329) In like fashion, Mr. Dhruva, too, has shown due appreciation [of young people] and, mingling with them, given proof of his skill in bringing them round firmly to his views.
('16', 106, 1, 7, 254502) That the Humanitarian League could accept Mr. Dhruva as its President proves that the League has been working along sound lines and that it will work more energetically in future to place its humanitarian principles before the people and cultivate public opinion.
('16', 106, 1, 8, 254766) And now I move the vote of thanks to the President which, I hope, you will all pass with acclamation.

('16', 106, 7, 15, 255070) SIR, I enclose herewith copy of a letter 1 recently addressed by me to the Press on the hardships of 3rd class railway passengers.
('16', 106, 7, 16, 255201) The hardships are of two kinds: those which are due to the neglect of the passengers themselves and those that can only be remedied by the Railway Companies.
('16', 106, 7, 17, 255359) They may again be divided into those that can be dealt with without any great extra cost and those that can be dealt with only on a large outlay of money.
('16', 106, 7, 18, 255514) I recognize that the hardships falling under the last category
('16', 106, 8, 19, 255577) 1 Vide “Letter to the Press on Third Class Travelling on Indian Railways”, 25 9 1917.
('16', 107, 0, 1, 255663) 108 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 107, 1, 2, 255705) cannot be effectively dealt with whilst the War is going on.
('16', 107, 1, 3, 255766) They are due to insufficiency of accommodation.
('16', 107, 1, 4, 255814) On this I venture to suggest that some check can certainly be exercised in the issue of tickets, and guards or other officials should be instructed to regulate the traffic.
('16', 107, 1, 5, 255987) As it is, the strongest find their own seats without any supervision or control by the officials and the weaker ones often find them selves left out.
('16', 107, 1, 6, 256137) Officials should not only be instructed to regulate the traffic, but they should also be required to examine the state of the compartments from time to time and see that no passengers appropriate space to the discomfort of other passengers.
('16', 107, 1, 7, 256378) In so far as the passengers are themselves responsible for the evils I have described, notices should be pasted on the walls of the carriages and put up at the stations giving detailed instructions regarding the use of closets, etc.
('16', 107, 1, 8, 256611) Bye laws prohibiting dirty or offensive practices may be cautiously enforced.
('16', 107, 1, 9, 256689) A book of instructions in the different vernaculars may be issued together with long journey tickets and otherwise given gratis on demand.
('16', 107, 1, 10, 256828) Co operation of volunteers should be invited from the general public in the prosecution of this educative work.
('16', 107, 1, 11, 256940) As to the other grievances: Station inspectors or the other officials should be directed tohave the carriages and closets swept and cleaned at every junction or principal station.
('16', 107, 1, 12, 257120) Station closets ought to be kept scrupulously clean, earth and disinfectants should be used every time closets are used.
('16', 107, 1, 13, 257241) This presupposes constant employment of Bhangis at every station.
('16', 107, 1, 14, 257307) In my humble opinion, the importance of the matter demands such employment.
('16', 107, 1, 15, 257383) It may be a wise thing to set apart special privies which any passenger may use on payment of a nominal fee.
('16', 107, 1, 16, 257492) At present there is no privacy provided in the station latrines.
('16', 107, 1, 17, 257557) I think that at a very small cost this can be provided.
('16', 107, 1, 18, 257613) There should be bathing facilities at all principal stations.
('16', 107, 1, 19, 257675) I understand that only licensed vendors are permitted to sell refreshments at the stations.
('16', 107, 1, 20, 257767) A written tariff should be provided and cleanliness of refreshments and vendors should be ensured before the granting of licences.
('16', 107, 1, 21, 257898) Third class refreshment rooms should not be allowed to be in the dirty state in which they are at present, but should be kept scrupulously clean.
('16', 107, 1, 22, 258044) Untold difficulties are put in the way of the passengers getting
('16', 108, 0, 1, 258109) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 109
('16', 108, 1, 2, 258155) their tickets on application.
('16', 108, 1, 3, 258185) Often they are issued only a short time before the departure of trains.
('16', 108, 1, 4, 258257) The result is bribery, a fight among passengers for the purchase of tickets and disappointment to many.
('16', 108, 2, 5, 258361) Waiting rooms at the principal stations need complete overhauling.
('16', 108, 2, 6, 258428) There ought to be regulations for the observance of passengers.
('16', 108, 2, 7, 258492) Benches should be provided in large numbers.
('16', 108, 2, 8, 258537) They should be cleaned several times during the day.
('16', 108, 2, 9, 258590) Rooms should be provided for the use of the fair sex.
('16', 108, 3, 10, 258644) In my humble opinion, all the evils except the provision of extra carriages can be dealt with at a very small additional cost to the railway administrations.
('16', 108, 3, 11, 258802) What is needed is sympathy and due recognition of the rights of third class passengers who provide the largest part of the income from passenger traffic.
('16', 108, 4, 12, 258956) Though the grievances here adverted to are old, they are pressing enough to demand immediate attention.
('16', 108, 4, 13, 259060) I hope that your department will take up the matter at an early date.
('16', 108, 4, 14, 259130) My services are at its disposal to be utilized in any manner it may deem fit.
('16', 108, 5, 15, 259208) I remain,
('16', 108, 6, 16, 259218) Yours faithfully,

('16', 109, 3, 4, 259485) BHAISHRI, I have your letter.
('16', 109, 3, 5, 259515) I had a talk about Viramgam.
('16', 109, 3, 6, 259544) 2 I am expecting a reply.
('16', 109, 3, 7, 259570) It ought to go and I have no doubt that it will.
('16', 109, 3, 8, 259619) The registered letter is with me.
('16', 109, 3, 9, 259653) I shall do what you want me to do, in part at least, when the time comes.
('16', 109, 3, 10, 259727) Of course, I very much want to go to Kathiawad, but I don’t know when I shall be able to.
('16', 109, 3, 11, 259817) For the present, six months are reserved for Bihar.

('16', 109, 9, 16, 260059) 1 From the reference in the letter to Viramgam and “six months reserved for Bihar”, the letter appears to have been written in 1917. 2 The imposition of a Customs cordon at Viramgam, on the border between the Kathiawad States and British Indian territory was causing considerable hardship to railway passengers.
('16', 109, 9, 17, 260371) Gandhiji’s attention to the problem was first drawn by Motilal, a tailor; vide An Autobiography, Part V, Ch. III.
('16', 109, 9, 18, 260485) After thoroughly studying the subject, Gandhiji wrote to the Bombay Government concerning the grievance.
('16', 109, 9, 19, 260590) Later he discussed it with the Governor, Lord Willingdon, and his secretary.
('16', 109, 9, 20, 260667) Gandhiji raised the matter, in the course of an interview, with the Viceroy, Lord Chelmsford, who promised redress.
('16', 109, 9, 21, 260783) The levy was annulled on November 10; vide “Speech at Gujarat Political Conference I”, November 3, 1917; also “Resolutions at Gujarat Political Conference II”, November 5, 1917. 3 Once the indigo labourers’ problem in Champaran, Bihar, had been tackled, Gandhiji decided to devote his efforts to educational and sanitation world in the province.

('16', 110, 2, 3, 261223) [GODHRA,] November 3, 1917
('16', 110, 3, 4, 261250) Lokamanya B. G. Tilak 2 having arrived late for the opening session, Gandhiji remarked:, I am not responsible for his being late.
('16', 110, 3, 5, 261380) We demand swaraj.
('16', 110, 3, 6, 261398) If one does not mind arriving late by three quarters of an hour at a conference summoned for the purpose, one should not mind if swaraj too comes correspondingly late.
('16', 110, 4, 7, 261566) Gandhiji then read his speech.
('16', 110, 5, 8, 261597) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, I am thankful to you all for the exalted position to which you have called me.
('16', 110, 5, 9, 261698) I am but a baby of two years and a half in Indian politics.
('16', 110, 5, 10, 261758) 4 I cannot trade here on my experience in South Africa.
('16', 110, 5, 11, 261814) I know that, in these circumstances, acceptance of the position is to a certain extent an impertinence.
('16', 110, 5, 12, 261918) I have accepted it, all the samc, unable to resist the pressure of your overwhelming affection.
('16', 110, 5, 13, 262014) I am conscious of my responsibility.
('16', 110, 5, 14, 262051) This Conference is the first of its kind in Gujarat.
('16', 110, 5, 15, 262104) The time is most critical for the whole of India.
('16', 110, 5, 16, 262154) The Empire is labouring under a strain never before experienced.
('16', 110, 5, 17, 262219) My views do not quite take the general course.
('16', 110, 5, 18, 262266) I feel that some of them run in the opposite direction.
('16', 110, 5, 19, 262322) Under the circumstances, I am hardly qualified for this privileged position.
('16', 110, 5, 20, 262399) The president of a meeting is usually its spokesman.
('16', 110, 5, 21, 262452) I cannot pretend to lay any such claim.
('16', 110, 5, 22, 262492) It is your kindness that gives me such a unique opportunityof placing my
('16', 110, 6, 23, 262565) 1 This was Gandhiji’s presidential address at the first Political Conference to be held in Gujarat.
('16', 110, 6, 24, 262665) It lasted three days and was largely attended by cultivators, petty traders and small land holders.
('16', 110, 6, 25, 262765) 2 Bal Gangadhar Tilak (l856 1920); great Indian political leader, scholar and writers popularly known as ‘Lokamanya’; one of the founders of the Deccan Education Society, Poona and of the newspapers the Kesari and the Mahratta; suffered six years’ deportation for his criticism of the Government; took active part in the Home Rule campaign.

('16', 111, 1, 2, 263383) thoughts before the Gujarat public.
('16', 111, 1, 3, 263419) I do not see anything wrong in these views being subjected to criticism, dissent and even emphatic protest.
('16', 111, 1, 4, 263527) I would like them to be freely discussed.
('16', 111, 1, 5, 263569) I will only say with regard to them that they were not formed today or yesterday.
('16', 111, 1, 6, 263651) But they were formed years ago.
('16', 111, 1, 7, 263683) I am enamoured of them, and my Indian experience of two years and a half has not altered them.
('16', 111, 1, 8, 263778) I congratulate the originators of the proposal to hold this conference as also those friends who have given practical shape to it.
('16', 111, 1, 9, 263909) It is a most important event for Gujarat.
('16', 111, 1, 10, 263951) It is possible for us to make it yield very valuable results.
('16', 111, 1, 11, 264013) This conference is in the nature of a foundation, and if it is well and truly laid, we need have no anxiety as to the superstructure.
('16', 111, 1, 12, 264147) Being in the nature of a foundation, it carries a heavy responsibility.
('16', 111, 1, 13, 264219) I pray that God may bless us with wisdom and that our deliberations will benefit the people.
('16', 111, 1, 14, 264312) This is a political conference.
('16', 111, 1, 15, 264344) Let us pause a moment over the word “political”.
('16', 111, 1, 16, 264393) It is, as a rule, used in a restricted sense, but I believe it is better to give it a wider meaning.
('16', 111, 1, 17, 264494) If the work of such a conference were to be confined to a consideration of the relations between the rulers and the ruled, it would not only be incomplete, but we should even fail to have an adequate conception of those relations.
('16', 111, 1, 18, 264725) For instance, the question of mahwa flowers 1 is of great importance for a part of Gujarat.
('16', 111, 1, 19, 264817) If it is considered merely as a question between the Government and the people, it might have unhappy consequences or we might fail in our aim.
('16', 111, 1, 20, 264961) If we considered the genesis of the law on mahwa flowers and also appreciated our duty as individuals in this matter, we would, very probably, succeed sooner in our fight with the Government than otherwise and easily discover the key to successful agitation.
('16', 111, 1, 21, 265220) You will more clearly perceive my interpretation of the word “political” in the light of the views I shall place before you.
('16', 111, 1, 22, 265345) Conferences do not, as a rule at the end of their deliberations, leave behind them an executive body, and even when such a body is appointed, it is, to use the language of the late Mr. Gokhale 2, composed of men who are amateurs; What we need is men who would

('16', 112, 1, 3, 266167) If such men come forward in great numbers, then and then only will such conferences be a credit to the country and produce lasting results.
('16', 112, 1, 4, 266307) At present there is much waste of energy.
('16', 112, 1, 5, 266349) It is desirable that there should be many institutions of the type of the Servants of India Society.
('16', 112, 1, 6, 266450) Only when men, fired with the belief that service is the highest religion, come forward in great numbers, could we hope to see great results.
('16', 112, 1, 7, 266592) Fortunately, India is richly endowed with the religious spirit, and if it is realized that in the present age service of the motherland is the best religion, religiously inclined men and women would take part in public life in larger numbers.
('16', 112, 1, 8, 266835) When sages and saints take up this work, I believe India will achieve her cherished aims quite easily.
('16', 112, 1, 9, 266938) At all events, it is incumbent on us that, for the purposes of this conference, we form an executive committee whose business it would be to enforce its resolutions.
('16', 112, 1, 10, 267104) The air in the country is thick with cries of swaraj.
('16', 112, 1, 11, 267158) It is due to Mrs. Besant 1 that swaraj is on the lips of hundreds of thousands of men and women.
('16', 112, 1, 12, 267255) What was unknown to most men and women only two years ago, has, by her consummate tact and her indefatigable efforts, become common property for them.
('16', 112, 1, 13, 267406) There cannot be the slightest doubt that her name will take the first rank in history among those who inspired us with the hope that swaraj was attainable at no distant date.
('16', 112, 1, 14, 267581) Swaraj was, and is, the goal of the Congress.
('16', 112, 1, 15, 267627) The idea did not originate with her.
('16', 112, 1, 16, 267664) 2 But the credit of presenting it to us as a goal realizable in the immediate future belongs to that lady alone.
('16', 112, 1, 17, 267777) For that we could hardly thank her enough.
('16', 112, 1, 18, 267820) By releasing her and her associates, Messrs Arun dale 3 and Wadia 4, Government have laid us under an obligation, and at

('16', 112, 3, 20, 268266) 2 Gandhiji evidently had in mind, Dadabhai Naoroji who, in 1906, first used the word swaraj to define the goal of the Indian National Congress at its Calcutta Session.
('16', 112, 3, 21, 268434) 3 G. S. Arundale was the head of the Society for the Promotion of National Education organized by Annie Besant.
('16', 112, 3, 22, 268546) He took active part in the Home Rule movement and suffered internment.
('16', 112, 3, 23, 268617) 4 B. P. Wadia organized the Home Rule League and took active part in Home Rule movement.

('16', 113, 1, 2, 268748) the same time acknowledged the just and reasonable nature of the agitation for swaraj.
('16', 113, 1, 3, 268835) 1 It is to be wished that the Government extend the same generosity towards our brothers, Mahomed Ali 2 and Shaukat Ali 3. It is not necessary to inquire how much of what Sir William Vincent 4 has said about them needs to be looked into.
('16', 113, 1, 4, 269073) It is to be hoped that the Government will accede to the people’s desire for their release and leave it to them to see that no untoward results follow.
('16', 113, 1, 5, 269225) This will place the people under a still greater obligation.
('16', 113, 1, 6, 269286) The act of generosity will be incomplete so long as these brothers are not released.
('16', 113, 1, 7, 269371) The grant of freedom to the brothers will gladden the people’s hearts and endear the Government to them.
('16', 113, 1, 8, 269476) 5 Mr. Montagu will shortly be in our midst.
('16', 113, 1, 9, 269520) The work of taking signatures to the petition 6 to be submitted to him is going on apace.
('16', 113, 1, 10, 269610) The chief object of this petition is to educate the people about swaraj.
('16', 113, 1, 11, 269683) To say that literacy is essential for achieving swaraj betrays ignorance of history.
('16', 113, 1, 12, 269768) It is not necessary for the purpose of inculcating among people the idea that we ought to manage our own affairs.
('16', 113, 1, 13, 269882) What is essential is the idea, the desire itself.
('16', 113, 1, 14, 269932) Hundreds of unlettered kings have ruled kingdoms with great success.
('16', 113, 1, 15, 270001) To see how far such an idea exists in the minds of the people and to try to create it where it is absent is the object of this petition.
('16', 113, 1, 16, 270138) It is desirable that millions of men and women should sign it with the fullest understanding of what it means.
('16', 113, 1, 17, 270249) That such a largely signed petition will naturally have its due
('16', 113, 2, 18, 270313) 1 Mrs. Besant and her associates had been interned at Coimbatore and Ootacamand on June 15, 1917. They were released on September 16 in pursuance of the new British policy embodied in the Montagu declaration of August 20. 2 Editor of The Comrade, an English weekly; was imprisoned, soon after the out break of World War, for publishing an article entitled “Evacuate Egypt”; along with his brother, he was interned in October 1914; attended the second Round Table Conference in London.
('16', 113, 2, 19, 270798) 3 Editor of Hamdard, suffered internment along with his younger brother, Mahomed Ali.

('16', 114, 1, 2, 271491) weight with Mr. Montagu is its natural result.
('16', 114, 1, 3, 271538) No one has the right to alter the scheme of reforms 1 approved by the Congress and the Moslem League, and one need not, therefore, go into the merits thereof.
('16', 114, 1, 4, 271697) For our present purposes, we have to understand thoroughly the scheme formulated most thoughtfully by our leaders and, putting our faith in them, do whatever is necessary to get it implemented.
('16', 114, 1, 5, 271891) This scheme is not swaraj, but is a great step towards swaraj.
('16', 114, 1, 6, 271954) Some English critics tell us that we are not fit to enjoy swaraj, because the class that demands it is incapable of defending India.
('16', 114, 1, 7, 272087) “Is the defence of India to rest with the British alone?” they ask, “and are the reins of Government to be in the hands of the Indians ?” Now this is a question which is both amusing and painful.
('16', 114, 1, 8, 272283) It is amusing because our British friends fancy that they are not of us, whilst our plan of swaraj is based upon retention of the British connection.
('16', 114, 1, 9, 272433) We do not want the Englishmen who have settled here to leave this country.
('16', 114, 1, 10, 272508) They will be our partners in swaraj.
('16', 114, 1, 11, 272545) And they will have nothing to complain about if, in such a scheme, the burden of the defence of the country falls on them.
('16', 114, 1, 12, 272668) They are, however, hasty in assuming that we shall not do our share of defending the country.
('16', 114, 1, 13, 272762) When India decides to acquire military strength, she will attain it in no time.
('16', 114, 1, 14, 272842) We have but to harden our feelings to be able to strike.
('16', 114, 1, 15, 272899) To cultivate a hardened feeling does not take ages.
('16', 114, 1, 16, 272951) It grows like weeds.
('16', 114, 1, 17, 272972) The question is painful, because it puts in mind the fact that the Government have up to now debarred us from military training.
('16', 114, 1, 18, 273101) Had they been so minded, they would have had at their disposal today, from among the educated classes, quite a large army.
('16', 114, 1, 19, 273224) Government have to accept a larger measure of blame than the educated classes for the latter having taken little part in the War.
('16', 114, 1, 20, 273354) Had the Government policy been shaped differently from the very beginning, they would have today an unconquerable army.
('16', 114, 1, 21, 273474) But let no one be blamed for the present situation.
('16', 114, 1, 22, 273526) At the time the British rule was established, it was considered a wise policy for the governance of crores of men to deprive them of arms and military
('16', 114, 2, 23, 273677) 1 This scheme of political reforms was originally drawn up and published, towards the end of 1916, by 19 members of the Imperial Legislative Council.
('16', 114, 2, 24, 273827) Briefly, it sought to subordinate the Executive to the Legislature.
('16', 114, 2, 25, 273895) The scheme came up for discussion at the sessions of the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League at Lucknow in December 1916. Elaborated and revised, the scheme, as accepted by both bodies in the wake of the Lucknow Pact, provided for the creation of a non official majority in the Legislative Councils.

('16', 115, 1, 3, 274293) But it is never too late to mend, and both the rulers and the ruled must immediately repair the omission.
('16', 115, 1, 4, 274399) In offering these views I have assumed the propriety of the current trend of thought.
('16', 115, 1, 5, 274485) To me, however, it does not appear to be tending altogether in the right direction.
('16', 115, 1, 6, 274569) Our agitation is based on the Western model.
('16', 115, 1, 7, 274614) The swaraj we desire is of a Western type.
('16', 115, 1, 8, 274657) As a result of it, India will have to enter into competition with the Western nations.
('16', 115, 1, 9, 274744) Many believe that there is no escape from this.
('16', 115, 1, 10, 274792) I do not think so.
('16', 115, 1, 11, 274811) I cannot forget that India is not Europe, India is not Japan, India is not China.
('16', 115, 1, 12, 274893) The divine word that “India alone is the land of karma 1, the rest is the land of bhoga (enjoyment),” is indelibly imprinted on my mind.
('16', 115, 1, 13, 275030) I feel that India’s mission is different from that of other countries.
('16', 115, 1, 14, 275101) India is fitted for the religious supremacy of the world.
('16', 115, 1, 15, 275159) There is no parallel in the world for the tapascharya that this country has voluntarily gone through.
('16', 115, 1, 16, 275261) India has little use for steel weapons; it has fought with divine weapons; it can still do so.
('16', 115, 1, 17, 275356) Other nations have been votaries of brute force.
('16', 115, 1, 18, 275405) The terrible war going on in Europe furnishes an irrefutable proof of this.
('16', 115, 1, 19, 275481) India can conquer all by soul force.
('16', 115, 1, 20, 275518) History supplies numerous instances to prove that brute force is nothing before soul force.
('16', 115, 1, 21, 275610) Poets have sung of this and men of wisdom have said so.
('16', 115, 1, 22, 275666) A thirty year old youth behaves like a lamb before his eighty year old father.
('16', 115, 1, 23, 275745) This is an instance of love force.
('16', 115, 1, 24, 275780) Love is atman 2: it is the very property of atman.
('16', 115, 1, 25, 275831) If we have faith enough, we can wield that force over the whole world.
('16', 115, 1, 26, 275902) Religion having lost its hold on us, we are without an anchor to keep us firm amidst the storm of modern civilization, and are, therefore, being tossed to and fro.
('16', 115, 1, 27, 276066) I shall return to this idea at a later stage.
('16', 115, 1, 28, 276112) These views of mine notwithstanding, I have joined the swaraj movement, for India is being governed at present under a modern system.
('16', 115, 1, 29, 276246) The Government themselves believe that the “Parliament” is the best form of that system.
('16', 115, 1, 30, 276335) Without such a parliament, we should have neither the modern nor the ancient form.
('16', 115, 1, 31, 276418) Mrs. Besant is only too true when she says that we shall soon be facing a hunger strike, if we do not have Home Rule.
('16', 115, 1, 32, 276536) I do not want to go into statistics.
('16', 115, 1, 33, 276573) The evidence of my eyes is enough for me.
('16', 115, 1, 34, 276615) Poverty in India is deepening day by day.
('16', 115, 1, 35, 276657) No other result is possible.
('16', 115, 1, 36, 276686) A country that exports its raw produce and imports it back as finished goods, a country which,

('16', 116, 1, 2, 276938) though growing its own cotton, has to pay crores of rupees to outsiders for its cloth, cannot be otherwise than poor.
('16', 116, 1, 3, 277056) A country, in which it is considered extravagance to spend on marriages, etc., can only be described as poor.
('16', 116, 1, 4, 277166) It must be a terribly poor country that cannot afford to spend enough in carrying out improvements for stamping out epidemics like the plague.
('16', 116, 1, 5, 277309) In a country whose officials spend most of their earnings outside, the people are bound to grow poorer day by day.
('16', 116, 1, 6, 277424) What are we to say of the poverty of a country whose people, during cold weather, burn their precious manure for want of woollen clothing in order to warm themselves?
('16', 116, 1, 7, 277591) Throughout my wanderings in India I have rarely, seen a face exuding strength and joy.
('16', 116, 1, 8, 277678) The middle classes are groaning under the weight of awful distress.
('16', 116, 1, 9, 277746) The lowest orders have nothing but the earth below and the sky above.
('16', 116, 1, 10, 277816) They do not know a bright day.
('16', 116, 1, 11, 277847) It is pure fiction to say that India’s riches are buried underground, or are to be found in her ornaments.
('16', 116, 1, 12, 277954) What there is of such riches is of no consequence.
('16', 116, 1, 13, 278005) The nation’s expenditure has increased, not so its income.
('16', 116, 1, 14, 278064) Government have not deliberately brought about this state of things.
('16', 116, 1, 15, 278133) I believe that their intentions are sincere.
('16', 116, 1, 16, 278178) It is their honest opinion that the nation’s prosperity is daily growing.
('16', 116, 1, 17, 278252) Their faith in their Blue books is immovable.
('16', 116, 1, 18, 278298) It is only too true that statistics can be made to prove anything.
('16', 116, 1, 19, 278365) The economists deduce India’s prosperity from statistics.
('16', 116, 1, 20, 278423) People like me who follow rough and ready ways of reckoning shake their heads over Blue book statistics.
('16', 116, 1, 21, 278528) If the gods were to come down and testify otherwise, I would insist on saying that I see India growing poorer.
('16', 116, 1, 22, 278639) What then would our Parliament do if we had one?
('16', 116, 1, 23, 278688) When we have it, we would have a right to commit blunders and to correct them.
('16', 116, 1, 24, 278767) In the early stages we are bound to make blunders.
('16', 116, 1, 25, 278818) But, we, being children of the soil, won’t lose time in setting ourselves right.
('16', 116, 1, 26, 278899) We shall, therefore, soon find out remedies against poverty.
('16', 116, 1, 27, 278960) Then our existence won’t be dependent on Lancashire goods.
('16', 116, 1, 28, 279019) Then we shall not be found spending untold riches on building Imperial Delhi.
('16', 116, 1, 29, 279097) It will, then, be in keeping with the cottages of India.
('16', 116, 1, 30, 279154) There will be some proportion observed between that cottage and our Parliament House.
('16', 116, 1, 31, 279240) The nation today is in a helpless condition; it does not possess even the right to err.
('16', 116, 1, 32, 279328) He who has no right to err can never go forward.
('16', 116, 1, 33, 279377) The history of the Commons is a history of blunders.
('16', 116, 1, 34, 279430) Man, says an Arabian proverb, is error personified.
('16', 116, 1, 35, 279482) The freedom to err and the power to correct errors is one definition of swaraj.
('16', 116, 1, 36, 279562) Having a parliament means such swaraj.
('16', 117, 0, 1, 279601) 118 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 117, 1, 2, 279643) We ought to have Parliament this very day.
('16', 117, 1, 3, 279686) We are quite fit for it.
('16', 117, 1, 4, 279711) We shall, therefore, get it on demand.
('16', 117, 1, 5, 279750) It rests with us to define “this very day”.
('16', 117, 1, 6, 279794) Swaraj is not to be attained through an appeal to the British democracy, the British people.
('16', 117, 1, 7, 279887) They cannot appreciate such an appeal Its reply will be: “We never sought outside help to obtain swaraj.
('16', 117, 1, 8, 279992) We achieved it with our own strength.
('16', 117, 1, 9, 280030) You have not received it because you do not deserve it.
('16', 117, 1, 10, 280086) When you do, nobody can withhold it from you.” How then shall we fit ourselves for it?
('16', 117, 1, 11, 280173) We have to demand swaraj from our own people.
('16', 117, 1, 12, 280219) Our appeal must be to them.
('16', 117, 1, 13, 280247) When the peasantry of India understands what swaraj is, the demand will become irresistible.
('16', 117, 1, 14, 280340) The late Sir W. W. Hunters 1 said that, in the British system, victory on the battle field was the shortest way to one’s goal.
('16', 117, 1, 15, 280467) If educated India had, silently, taken its full share in the present War, I am certain that we would not only have reached our goal already, but the manner of it would have been altogether unique.
('16', 117, 1, 16, 280664) We often refer to the fact that many sepoys of Hindustan have lost their lives on the battle fields of France and Mesopotamia.
('16', 117, 1, 17, 280791) The educated classes cannot claim the credit for this.
('16', 117, 1, 18, 280846) They were not sent out by us, nor did they join up through patriotism.
('16', 117, 1, 19, 280917) They know nothing of swaraj.
('16', 117, 1, 20, 280946) At the end of the War they will not ask for it.
('16', 117, 1, 21, 280994) They have gone to demonstrate that they are faithful to the salt they eat.
('16', 117, 1, 22, 281069) In asking for swaraj, I feel that it is not possible for us to bring into account their services.
('16', 117, 1, 23, 281167) The only thing we can say is that we are not to blame for not being able to take a big part in the prosecution of the War.
('16', 117, 1, 24, 281290) That we have been loyal at a time of stress is no test of fitness for swaraj.
('16', 117, 1, 25, 281368) Loyalty is no merit.
('16', 117, 1, 26, 281389) It is a necessity of national existence all the world over.
('16', 117, 1, 27, 281449) That loyalty can be no passport to swaraj is a self demonstrated maxim.
('16', 117, 1, 28, 281521) Our fitness lies in that we now keenly desire swaraj, and in our clearly realizing that bureaucracy, although it has served India with best intentions, has had its day.
('16', 117, 1, 29, 281690) And this kind of fitness is sufficient

('16', 118, 2, 4, 282086) But if we confine our activities for advancing swaraj only to holding meetings, the nation is likely to suffer harm.
('16', 118, 2, 5, 282203) Meetings and speeches have their own place and time.
('16', 118, 2, 6, 282256) But they cannot make a nation.
('16', 118, 3, 7, 282287) In a nation fired with the zeal for swaraj, we should observe an awakening in all departments of life.
('16', 118, 3, 8, 282390) The first step to swaraj lies in the individual.
('16', 118, 3, 9, 282439) The great truth, “As with the individual, so with the Universe,” is applicable here as elsewhere.
('16', 118, 3, 10, 282537) If we are ever torn by conflict from within, if we are ever going astray, and if instead of ruling our passions we allow them to rule us, swaraj can have no meaning for us.
('16', 118, 3, 11, 282710) Government of self, then, is the first step.
('16', 118, 4, 12, 282755) Then the family.
('16', 118, 4, 13, 282772) If dissensions reign supreme in our families, if brothers fight among themselves, if members of a family cannot live together; if joint families, i.e., families enjoying self government, become divided through family quarrels, how can we be considered fit for swaraj ?
('16', 118, 5, 14, 283041) Now for caste.
('16', 118, 5, 15, 283056) If caste fellows become jealous of one another, if the castes cannot manage their affairs in an orderly manner, if the elders claim especial importance, if the members become self opinionated and thus show their unfitness for self government in this limited sphere, how can they be fit for national government ?
('16', 118, 6, 16, 283368) After caste, the city.
('16', 118, 6, 17, 283391) If we cannot regulate the affairs of our cities, if our streets are not kept clean, if our homes are dilapidated and if our roads are crooked, if we cannot command the services of selfless citizens for civic government, and those who are in charge of affairs are neglectful or selfish, how shall we claim larger powers?
('16', 118, 7, 18, 283711) The way to national life lies through the cities.
('16', 118, 7, 19, 283761) It is, therefore, necessary to linger a little longer on this subject.
('16', 118, 7, 20, 283832) The plague has found a home in India.
('16', 118, 7, 21, 283870) 1 Cholera has been always with us.
('16', 118, 7, 22, 283905) Malaria takes an annual toll of thousands.
('16', 118, 7, 23, 283948) The plague has been driven out from every other part of the world.
('16', 118, 7, 24, 284015) Glasgow stamped it out the moment it made its appearance there.
('16', 118, 7, 25, 284079) In Johannesburg it could appear
('16', 118, 8, 26, 284111) 1 Plague appeared in a serious form in 1917 and, between July of that year and June 1918, accounted for over 8,00,000 deaths.

('16', 119, 1, 2, 284279) but once.
('16', 119, 1, 3, 284289) 1 Its municipality made a great effort and stamped it out within a month, whereas we are able to do nothing about it.
('16', 119, 1, 4, 284407) We cannot blame the Government for this state of things.
('16', 119, 1, 5, 284464) To tell the truth, we cannot even blame it on our poverty.
('16', 119, 1, 6, 284523) None can stand in our way in any remedies that we may wish to adopt.
('16', 119, 1, 7, 284592) Ahmedabad, for instance, cannot evade responsibility by pleading poverty.
('16', 119, 1, 8, 284666) I am afraid that in regard to the plague, we must shoulder the entire responsibility.
('16', 119, 1, 9, 284752) It is very significant that when the plague is working havoc in our ruralquarters, cantonments as a rule remain free.
('16', 119, 1, 10, 284870) The reasons are obvious.
('16', 119, 1, 11, 284895) In the cantonments the air is pure, houses detached, roads are wide and clean and the sanitary habits of the residents wholesome, whereas ours are as unhygienic as they well could be.
('16', 119, 1, 12, 285079) Our closets are as filthy as hell.
('16', 119, 1, 13, 285114) In a country in which ninety per cent of the population go barefoot, people spit anywhere and perform natural functions anywhere and we are obliged to walk on roads and paths thus dirtied.
('16', 119, 1, 14, 285303) It is no wonder that the plague has found a home in our midst.
('16', 119, 2, 15, 285366) Unless we alter the conditions in our cities, rid ourselves of our dirty habits and have improved latrines, swaraj can have no value for us.
('16', 119, 3, 16, 285507) It will not be out of place here to refer to another matter.
('16', 119, 3, 17, 285568) We regard men who render us most useful service, Bhangis, as untouchables.
('16', 119, 3, 18, 285643) The result has been that we let them clean only a part of our closets.
('16', 119, 3, 19, 285714) In the name of religion, we ourselves would not clean the places for fear of pollution and so, despite our reputation for personal cleanliness, a portion of our houses remains the dirtiest in the world, with the result that we grow up in an air which is laden with disease germs.
('16', 119, 3, 20, 285994) We were safe so long as we kept to our villages.
('16', 119, 3, 21, 286043) But in the cities we are ever committing suicide by reason of our insanitary habits.
('16', 119, 3, 22, 286128) Where large numbers suffer living death, it is very likely that people know neither true religion nor right action and conduct.
('16', 119, 3, 23, 286256) I believe that it ought not to be beyond us to banish the plague from India, and if we can do so, we shall have so increased our fitness for swaraj, as it cannot be by any agitation, howsoever powerful.
('16', 119, 3, 24, 286459) This is a question meriting the serious consideration of our doctors and

('16', 120, 1, 2, 286709) vaidyas 1. Not far from here is the holy centre of pilgrimage, Dakor.
('16', 120, 1, 3, 286779) I have visited it.
('16', 120, 1, 4, 286798) Its unholiness is limitless.
('16', 120, 1, 5, 286827) I consider myself a devout Vaishnava 2. I claim, therefore, a special privilege of criticising the condition of Dakorji.
('16', 120, 1, 6, 286948) The insanitation of that place is so great that one used to hygienic conditions can hardly bear to pass even twenty four hours there.
('16', 120, 1, 7, 287082) The pilgrims pollute the tank and the streets as they choose.
('16', 120, 1, 8, 287144) The keepers of the shrine quarrel among themselves and, to add insult to injury, a receiver has been appointed to take charge of the jewellery and costly robes of the idol.
('16', 120, 1, 9, 287317) It is our clear duty to set matters right.
('16', 120, 1, 10, 287360) How shall we, Gujaratis, out to have swaraj, fare as soldiers in the army fighting for it, if we cannot put our own house in order?
('16', 120, 1, 11, 287492) To think of the state of education in our cities also fills us with despair.
('16', 120, 1, 12, 287569) It is plainly our duty by our own effort to provide education to the masses.
('16', 120, 1, 13, 287646) But our gaze is fixed upon Government, whilst thousands of children go without education.
('16', 120, 1, 14, 287736) In the cities the drink evil is on the increase, tea shops are multiplying, gambling is rampant.
('16', 120, 1, 15, 287833) If we cannot remedy these evils, how can we attain swaraj ?
('16', 120, 1, 16, 287893) Swaraj means managing our own affairs.
('16', 120, 2, 17, 287932) We are approaching a time when we and our children may have to go without milk altogether.
('16', 120, 2, 18, 288023) Dairies, here in Gujarat, are doing us infinite harm.
('16', 120, 2, 19, 288077) They buy out practically the whole milk supply and produce butter, cheese, etc., for sale.
('16', 120, 2, 20, 288168) How can a nation whose nourishment is chiefly derived from milk permit itself to be deprived of this important article of food?
('16', 120, 2, 21, 288296) How can men be so selfish as to be heedless of the national health and think of enriching themselves through commercial exploitation of an article of diet ?
('16', 120, 2, 22, 288453) Milk and its products are of such paramount value to the nation that they deserve to be controlled by the municipalities.
('16', 120, 2, 23, 288575) What are we doing about them?
('16', 120, 2, 24, 288605) I have just returned from the scene of Bakr i Id riots.
('16', 120, 2, 25, 288661) For a trivial cause, the two communities fell out with each other, mischie vous men joined in the fray and a mere spark became a blaze.
('16', 120, 2, 26, 288797) We found ourselves helpless.
('16', 120, 2, 27, 288826) We have been obliged to depend entirely upon Government assistance.
('16', 120, 2, 28, 288894) This shows how crippled we are.

('16', 121, 1, 2, 289156) It will not be inopportune to dwell for a moment on the question of cow protection.
('16', 121, 1, 3, 289240) It is an important question.
('16', 121, 1, 4, 289269) And yet it is left to be solved by cow protection societies.
('16', 121, 1, 5, 289330) Protecting the cows seems to be an ancient practice.
('16', 121, 1, 6, 289383) It originated in the special needs of this country.
('16', 121, 1, 7, 289435) Protection of its cows is incumbent upon a country 90 per cent.
('16', 121, 1, 8, 289499) of whose population lives upon agricu lture and needs bullocks for it.
('16', 121, 1, 9, 289570) In such a country, even meat eaters should abstain from beef eating.
('16', 121, 1, 10, 289639) These natural causes should be enough justification for not killing cows.
('16', 121, 1, 11, 289713) But here we have to face a peculiar situation.
('16', 121, 1, 12, 289760) The chief meaning of cow protection seems to be to prevent cows from falling into the hands of our Muslim brethren and being used as food.
('16', 121, 1, 13, 289899) The rulers need beef.
('16', 121, 1, 14, 289921) On their account thousands of cows are slaughtered daily.
('16', 121, 1, 15, 289979) We do nothing to prevent this slaughter.
('16', 121, 1, 16, 290020) We hardly make any attempt to prevent the cruel torture of cows by certain Hindus of Calcutta, who subject them to a practice known as “blowing” and make them yield the last drop of milk.
('16', 121, 1, 17, 290208) In Gujarat, Hindu cart drivers use sharp goads to drive bullocks.
('16', 121, 1, 18, 290274) We say nothing about this.
('16', 121, 1, 19, 290301) The condition of bullocks in our cities is pitiable.
('16', 121, 1, 20, 290354) Indeed, protection of the cow and her progeny is a very great problem.
('16', 121, 1, 21, 290425) By making it a pretext for quarrelling with the Muslims, we have only ensured greater slaughter of cows.
('16', 121, 1, 22, 290530) It is not religion, but want of it, to kill a Muslim brother in order to save a cow.
('16', 121, 1, 23, 290615) I feel sure that if we were to discuss the matter with our Muslim brethren in the spirit of love, they also would appreciate the peculiar condition of India and readily co operate with us in the protection of cows.
('16', 121, 1, 24, 290830) By courtesy and through satyagraha, we can bring them to join that mission.
('16', 121, 1, 25, 290906) But, in order to be able to do this, we shall have to understand the question in its true bearing.
('16', 121, 1, 26, 291005) Instead of killing our brethren, we should be ready to die ourselves.
('16', 121, 1, 27, 291075) But we shall be able to do this only when we understand the real value of the cow and have pure love for her.
('16', 121, 1, 28, 291185) Success in this will ensure several things simulta neously.
('16', 121, 1, 29, 291245) Hindus and Muslims will live in peace, the cow will be safe, milk and its products will be available in a pure condition and will be cheaper than now, and our bullocks will become the envy of the world.
('16', 121, 1, 30, 291448) If our tapascharya is pure, we shall succeed in stopping slaughter of cows, whether by the British, Muslims or Hindus.
('16', 121, 1, 31, 291567) Even this one achievement will bring swaraj nearer.
('16', 121, 2, 32, 291619) Many of these issues arise out of civic government.
('16', 121, 2, 33, 291671) We can clearly see from this that our running the Government of India is dependent upon our upright management of civic affairs.
('16', 122, 0, 1, 291800) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 123
('16', 122, 1, 2, 291846) It will not be incorrect to say that practically there is no swadeshi movement in the country.
('16', 122, 1, 3, 291941) We do not realize that this movement almost holds the key to swaraj.
('16', 122, 1, 4, 292010) If we have no regard for our own language, if we feel aversion to cloth made in our country, if our dress repels us, if we are ashamed to wear the sacred shikha 1, if our food is distasteful to us, even our climate is not good enough, our people uncouth and unfit for our company, our civilization ugly and the foreign attractive, in short, if everything native is bad and everything foreign pleasing to us, I do not know what swaraj can mean for us.
('16', 122, 1, 5, 292461) If everything foreign is to be adopted, surely it will be necessary for us to continue long under foreign tutelage, for so far foreign ways have touched the masses but little.
('16', 122, 1, 6, 292637) It seems to me that, before we can appreciate swaraj, we should have not only love but passion for swadeshi.
('16', 122, 1, 7, 292746) Every act of ours should bear the swadeshi stamp.
('16', 122, 1, 8, 292796) Swaraj can only be built upon the assumption that most of what is national is, on the whole, sound.
('16', 122, 1, 9, 292896) If the view here put forth be correct, we should have a big movement in our country for swadeshi.
('16', 122, 1, 10, 292994) Every country that has carried on a move ment for swaraj has fully appreciated the swadeshi spirit.
('16', 122, 1, 11, 293094) Scottish Highlanders hold on to their kilts even at the risk of their lives.
('16', 122, 1, 12, 293171) We humorously call them the“petticoat brigade”.
('16', 122, 1, 13, 293219) But the whole world testifies to the strength that lies behind that “petticoat” and the Highlanders of Scotland will not abandon it, even though it is an inconvenient dress, and an easy target for the enemy.
('16', 122, 1, 14, 293427) I don’t wish to suggest that we should treasure our faults, but that what is national, even though not rich in excellences, should be adhered to, and that what is foreign should be avoided though one may succeed well enough in adopting it.
('16', 122, 1, 15, 293667) That which is wanting in our civilization can be supplied by proper effort on our part.
('16', 122, 1, 16, 293755) I do hope that the swadeshi spirit will possess every member in this assembly; if they all take the vow of swadeshi and observe it in the face of any difficulty or inconvenience, swaraj will be easy of attainment.
('16', 122, 1, 17, 293969) The foregoing illustrations go to show that our movement should be twofold.
('16', 122, 1, 18, 294045) We may petition the Government, we may agitate in the Imperial Council for our rights; but for a real awakening of the people, the more important thing is activities directed inwards.
('16', 122, 1, 19, 294229) There is a possibility of hypocrisy and selfishness tainting activities directed outwards.
('16', 122, 1, 20, 294320) There is very much less danger of this in activities of the other kind.
('16', 122, 1, 21, 294392) Not only will the former not be justified unless balanced

('16', 123, 1, 2, 294555) by the latter, they may even be barren of res ults.
('16', 123, 1, 3, 294607) It is not my contention that we have no activities at all directed inward, but I submit that we do not lay enough stress upon them.
('16', 123, 1, 4, 294739) One sometimes hears it said, “Let us get the government of India in our own hands; everything will be all right afterwards.” There could be no greater superstition than this.
('16', 123, 1, 5, 294914) No nation has gained its independence in this manner.
('16', 123, 1, 6, 294968) The splendour of the spring is reflected in every tree, the whole earth is then filled with the freshness of youth.
('16', 123, 1, 7, 295084) Similarly, when the spring of swaraj is on us, a stranger suddenly arriving in our midst will observe the freshness of youth in every walk of life and find servants of the people engaged, each according to his own abilities, in all manner of public activities.
('16', 123, 2, 8, 295345) If we admit that our progress has not been what it might have been, we should also admit two reasons for this.
('16', 123, 2, 9, 295456) We have kept our women away from these activities of ours and have thus become victims of a kind of paralysis.
('16', 123, 2, 10, 295567) The nation walks with one leg only.
('16', 123, 2, 11, 295603) All its work appears to be only half or incompletely done.
('16', 123, 2, 12, 295662) Moreover, the educated section, having received its education through a foreign tongue, has become enervated and is unable to give the nation the benefit of such ability as it acquires.
('16', 123, 2, 13, 295848) I need not reiterate my views on this subject, as I have elaborated them in my address 1 at the Gujarat Educational Conference.
('16', 123, 2, 14, 295976) It is a wise decision, that of conducting the proceedings of this conference in Gujarati, and I hope that nothing will induce the people of Gujarat to change it.
('16', 123, 3, 15, 296138) The educated class, lovers of swaraj, must freely mix with the masses.
('16', 123, 3, 16, 296209) We dare not turn away from a single section of the community or disown any.
('16', 123, 3, 17, 296285) We shall make progress only if we carry all with us.
('16', 123, 3, 18, 296338) Had the educated class identified itself with the masses, Bakr i Id riots would have been an impossibility.
('16', 123, 4, 19, 296446) Before coming to the last topic, it remains for me to refer to certain events as a matter of duty and to make one or two suggestions.
('16', 123, 5, 20, 296580) Every year the god of death exacts his toll from among our leaders.
('16', 123, 5, 21, 296648) I do not intend to mention the victims claimed by this god all over India during the last 12 months.
('16', 123, 5, 22, 296749) But it is impossible to omit reference to the sage like Grand Old Man 2 of India.
('16', 123, 5, 23, 296831) Who am I to estimate the value of his services to the country ?

('16', 124, 1, 7, 297423) May He grant his family and the Nation the ability to bear the loss.
('16', 124, 1, 8, 297492) We can immortalize him by making his character our own, by copying his manner of service and by enthroning him for ever in our hearts.
('16', 124, 1, 9, 297627) May the great soul of Dadabhai watch over our deliberations !
('16', 124, 1, 10, 297689) It is our duty to express our thanks to His Excellency the Viceroy for having announced the decision of the Government of India to abolish the customs levy on the border [between Saurashtra and British Indian territory] at Viramgam.
('16', 124, 1, 11, 297922) This step should have been taken earlier.
('16', 124, 1, 12, 297964) The people were groaning under the weight of this impost.
('16', 124, 1, 13, 298022) It cost large numbers their trade.
('16', 124, 1, 14, 298057) It has caused much suffering to many women.
('16', 124, 1, 15, 298101) The decision does not seem to have been brought into effect.
('16', 124, 1, 16, 298162) It is to be hoped that it will soon be.
('16', 124, 1, 17, 298202) I have submitted through the Press my experiences about the hardships of third class railway passengers.
('16', 124, 1, 18, 298307) 2 They are, indeed, past endurance.
('16', 124, 1, 19, 298343) The people of India are docile and trained in silent suffering.
('16', 124, 1, 20, 298407) Thousands, therefore, put up with the hardships, but they remain unredressed.
('16', 124, 1, 21, 298485) There is, indeed, merit in such suffering, but it must have its limits.
('16', 124, 1, 22, 298557) Submission out of weakness is unmanliness.
('16', 124, 1, 23, 298600) That we tamely put up with the hardships of railway travelling is a sign of our unmanliness.
('16', 124, 1, 24, 298693) These hardships are of two kinds, those which are due to the remissness of railway administration and those occasioned by the carelessness of the travelling public.
('16', 124, 1, 25, 298858) The remedies are also, therefore, twofold.
('16', 124, 1, 26, 298901) Where the railway administration is to blame, complaints should be addressed to it by everyone who suffers.
('16', 124, 1, 27, 299009) This may be done even in Gujarati.
('16', 124, 1, 28, 299044) The matter should be ventilated in the Press.
('16', 124, 1, 29, 299090) Secondly, where the public are to blame, the wiser among passengers should inculcate manners upon their ignorant companions and enlighten them on their carelessness and dirty habits.
('16', 124, 1, 30, 299273) This will require volunteers.
('16', 124, 1, 31, 299303) Everyone can do his share according to his ability,
('16', 124, 2, 32, 299355) 1 Gandhiji sought his counsel and help during his public life in South Africa.

('16', 125, 1, 2, 299602) and leaders might, in order to appreciate the difficulties of third class travelling, resort to it from time to time without making themselves known and bring their unhappy experiences to the notice of the administration.
('16', 125, 1, 3, 299824) If these remedies are adopted, we should, in a short time, see great changes.
('16', 125, 1, 4, 299902) A committee had been appointed in London to consider certain measures about the supply of indentured labour to Fiji and the other sister islands.
('16', 125, 1, 5, 300048) The views of that committee have been officially published and the Government of India have invited the opinion of the public upon them.
('16', 125, 1, 6, 300185) I need not dwell at length upon the matter as I have submitted my views already through the Press.
('16', 125, 1, 7, 300284) I have given it as my opinion that the recommendations of the committee, if adopted, will result in a kind of indenture.
('16', 125, 1, 8, 300405) We can, therefore, only come to one conclusion.
('16', 125, 1, 9, 300453) We do not want to see labourers emigrating under bondage in any shape or form.
('16', 125, 1, 10, 300532) There is no need for such emigration.
('16', 125, 1, 11, 300570) The only thing required is a complete repeal of the law of indenture.
('16', 125, 1, 12, 300640) It is no part of our duty to look to the convenience of the Colonies.
('16', 125, 1, 13, 300710) I come now to the last subject.
('16', 125, 1, 14, 300742) There are two methods of attaining one’s goal.
('16', 125, 1, 15, 300789) Satyagraha 1 and duragraha 2. In our scriptures, they have been described, respectively, as divine and devilish modes of action.
('16', 125, 1, 16, 300918) In satyagraha, there is always unflinching adherence to truth.
('16', 125, 1, 17, 300981) It is never to be forsaken on any account.
('16', 125, 1, 18, 301024) Even for the sake of one’s country, it does not permit resort to false hood.
('16', 125, 1, 19, 301101) It proceeds on the assumption of the ultimate triumph of truth.
('16', 125, 1, 20, 301165) A satyagrahi does not abandon his path, even though at times it seems impenetrable and beset with difficulties and dangers, and a slight departure from that straight path may appear full of promise.
('16', 125, 1, 21, 301364) Even in these circumstances, his faith shines resplendent like the midday sun and he does not despond.
('16', 125, 1, 22, 301467) With truth for sword, he needs neither a steel sword nor gun powder.
('16', 125, 1, 23, 301536) Even an inveterate enemy he conquers by the force of the soul, which is love.
('16', 125, 1, 24, 301614) Love for a friend is not put to the test.
('16', 125, 1, 25, 301656) There is nothing surprising in a friend loving a friend; there is no merit in it and it costs no effort.
('16', 125, 1, 26, 301761) When love is bestowed on the so called enemy, it is tested, it becomes a virtue and requires an effort, and hence it is an act of manliness and real bravery.
('16', 125, 1, 27, 301919) We can cultivate such an attitude
('16', 125, 2, 28, 301953) 1 Literally, “holding to truth”, pursuit of a right cause, a method of political agitation which found expression later in successive civil disobedience campaigns in India.
('16', 125, 2, 29, 302126) 2 Pursuit of a wrong cause or in a manner unworthy of the cause
('16', 126, 0, 1, 302190) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 127
('16', 126, 1, 2, 302236) even towards the Government and, doing so, we shall be able to appre ciate their beneficial activities and, as for their errors, rather than feel bitter on their account, point them out in love and so get them rectified.
('16', 126, 1, 3, 302457) Love does not act through fear.
('16', 126, 1, 4, 302489) Weakness there certainly cannot be.
('16', 126, 1, 5, 302525) A coward is incapable of bearing love, it is the prerogative of the brave.
('16', 126, 1, 6, 302600) Looking at everything with love, we shall not regard the Government with suspicion, nor believe that all their actions are inspired with bad motives.
('16', 126, 1, 7, 302750) And our examination of their actions, being directed by love, will be unerring and is bound, therefore, to carry conviction with them.
('16', 126, 2, 8, 302885) Love can fight; often, it is obliged to.
('16', 126, 2, 9, 302926) In the intoxication of power, man fails to see his error.
('16', 126, 2, 10, 302984) When that happens, a satyagrahi does not sit still.
('16', 126, 2, 11, 303036) He suffers.
('16', 126, 2, 12, 303048) He disobeys the ruler’s orders and his laws in a civil manner, and willingly submits to the penalties of such disobedience, for instance, imprisonment and gallows.
('16', 126, 2, 13, 303212) Thus is the soul disciplined.
('16', 126, 2, 14, 303242) In this, one never finds that one’s time has been wasted and, if it is subsequently realized that such respectful disobedience was an error, the consequences are suffered merely by the satyagrahi and his co workers.
('16', 126, 2, 15, 303458) In the event, no bitterness develops between the satyagrahi and those in power; the latter, on the contrary, willingly yield to him.
('16', 126, 2, 16, 303591) They discover that they cannot command the satyagrahi’s obedience.
('16', 126, 2, 17, 303658) They cannot make him do anything against his will.
('16', 126, 2, 18, 303709) And this is the consummation of swaraj, because it means complete independence.
('16', 126, 2, 19, 303789) It need not be assumed that such resistance is possible only against civilized rulers.
('16', 126, 2, 20, 303876) Even a heart of flint will melt in the fire kindled by the power of the soul.
('16', 126, 2, 21, 303954) Even a Nero becomes a lamb when he faces love.
('16', 126, 2, 22, 304001) This is no exaggeration.
('16', 126, 2, 23, 304026) It is as true as an algebraic equation.
('16', 126, 2, 24, 304066) This satyagraha is India’s distinctive weapon.
('16', 126, 2, 25, 304113) It has had others but satyagraha has been in greater use.
('16', 126, 2, 26, 304171) It is an unfailing source of strength, and is capable of being used at all times and under all circumstances.
('16', 126, 2, 27, 304281) It requires no stamp of approval from the Congress or any other body.
('16', 126, 2, 28, 304351) He who knows its power cannot but use it.
('16', 126, 2, 29, 304393) Even as the eyelashes automatically protect the eyes, so does satyagraha, when kindled, automatically protect the freedom of the soul.
('16', 126, 3, 30, 304528) But duragraha is a force with the opposite attributes.
('16', 126, 3, 31, 304583) As we saw earlier, the terrible War going on in Europe is a case in point.
('16', 126, 3, 32, 304658) Why should a nation’s cause be considered right and another’s wrong because it overpowers the latter by sheer brute force?
('16', 126, 3, 33, 304781) The strong are
('16', 127, 0, 1, 304796) 128 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 127, 1, 2, 304838) often seen preying upon the weak.
('16', 127, 1, 3, 304872) The wrongness of the latter’s cause is not to be inferred from their defeat in a trial of brute strength, nor is the rightness of the strong to be inferred from their success in such a trial.
('16', 127, 1, 4, 305064) The wielder of brute force does not scruple about the means to be used.
('16', 127, 1, 5, 305136) He does not question the propriety of means, if he can somehow achieve his purpose.
('16', 127, 1, 6, 305220) This is not dharma but the opposite of it.
('16', 127, 1, 7, 305263) In dharma, there can be no room for even a particle of untruth or cruelty, and no injury to life.
('16', 127, 1, 8, 305361) The measure of dharma is love, compassion, truth.
('16', 127, 1, 9, 305411) Heaven itself, if attained through sacrifice of these, is to be despised.
('16', 127, 1, 10, 305485) Swaraj is useless at the sacrifice of truth.
('16', 127, 1, 11, 305530) Such swaraj will ultimately ruin the people.
('16', 127, 1, 12, 305575) The man who follows the path of duragraha becomes impatient and wants to kill the so called enemy.
('16', 127, 1, 13, 305674) There can be but one result of this.
('16', 127, 1, 14, 305711) Hatred increases.
('16', 127, 1, 15, 305729) The defeated party vows vengeance and simply bides its time.
('16', 127, 1, 16, 305790) The spirit of revenge thus descends from father to son.
('16', 127, 1, 17, 305846) It is much to be wished that India never gives predominance to this spirit of duragraha.
('16', 127, 1, 18, 305935) If the members of this assembly deliberately accept satyagraha and chalk out its programme accordingly, they will reach their goal all the more easily for doing so.
('16', 127, 1, 19, 306100) They may have to face disappointment in the initial stages.
('16', 127, 1, 20, 306160) They may not see results for a time.
('16', 127, 1, 21, 306197) But satyagraha will triumph in the end.
('16', 127, 1, 22, 306237) The duragrahi, like the oilman’s ox, moves in a circle.
('16', 127, 1, 23, 306293) His movement is only motion but it is not progress.
('16', 127, 1, 24, 306345) The satyagrahi is ever moving forward.
('16', 127, 1, 25, 306384) A superficial critic of my views may find some contradiction in them.
('16', 127, 1, 26, 306454) On the one hand, I appeal to the Government to give military training to the people.
('16', 127, 1, 27, 306539) On the other, I put satyagraha on the pedestal.
('16', 127, 1, 28, 306587) Surely, there can be no room for the use of arms in satyagraha?
('16', 127, 1, 29, 306651) Of course there is none.
('16', 127, 1, 30, 306676) But military training is intended for those who do not believe in satyagraha.
('16', 127, 1, 31, 306754) That the whole of India will ever accept satyagraha is beyond my imagination.
('16', 127, 1, 32, 306832) A cowardly refusal to defend the nation, or the weak, is ever to be shunned.
('16', 127, 1, 33, 306909) In order to protect an innocent woman from the brutal design of a man, we ought to offer ourselves a willing sacrifice and by the force of love conquer the brute in the man.
('16', 127, 1, 34, 307083) Lacking such strength, we should employ all our physical strength to frustrate those designs.
('16', 127, 1, 35, 307177) The satyagrahi and the duragrahi are both warriors.
('16', 127, 1, 36, 307229) The latter, bereft of his arms, acknowledges defeat, the former never.
('16', 127, 1, 37, 307300) He does not depend upon the perishable body and its weapons, but he fights on with the strength of the unconquerable and immortal atman.
('16', 127, 1, 38, 307437) Anyone who is neither of the two is not a man, for he does not recognize the atman.
('16', 127, 1, 39, 307521) If he did, he would not take
('16', 128, 0, 1, 307550) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 129
('16', 128, 1, 2, 307596) fright and run away from danger.
('16', 128, 1, 3, 307629) Like a miser his wealth, he tries to save his body and loses all; such a one does not know how to die.
('16', 128, 1, 4, 307732) But the armoured soldier always has death by him as a companion.
('16', 128, 1, 5, 307797) There is hope of his becoming one day a satyagrahi.
('16', 128, 1, 6, 307849) The right thing to hope from India is that this great and holy Aryan land will ever give the predominant place to the divine force and employ the weapon of satyagraha, that it will never accept the supremacy of armed strength.
('16', 128, 1, 7, 308076) India will never respect the principle of might being right.
('16', 128, 1, 8, 308137) She will ever reserve her allegiance to the principle: “Truth alone triumphs.”
('16', 128, 2, 9, 308216) On reflection, we find that we can employ satyagraha even for social reform.
('16', 128, 2, 10, 308293) We can rid ourselves of the many defects of our caste system.
('16', 128, 2, 11, 308355) We can resolve Hindu Muslim differences and can solve political problems.
('16', 128, 2, 12, 308429) It is all right that, for the sake of convenience, we speak of these things as separate subjects.
('16', 128, 2, 13, 308527) But it should never be forgotten that they are all closely inter related.
('16', 128, 2, 14, 308601) It is not true to say that neither religion nor social reform has anything to do with politics.
('16', 128, 2, 15, 308697) The result obtained by bringing religion into play in the field of politics will be different from that obtained otherwise.
('16', 128, 2, 16, 308821) When thinking of political matters, we cannot ignore 56,000 ignorant sadhus living as wandering mendicants.
('16', 128, 2, 17, 308929) Our Muslim brethren cannot lose sight of their fakirs.
('16', 128, 2, 18, 308984) Nor can we be unmindful of the condition of our widows and the custom of child marriage and the Muslims of the custom of purdah.
('16', 128, 2, 19, 309113) The two communities cannot, likewise, shut their eyes to scores of questions that arise between them.
('16', 128, 3, 20, 309215) Indeed, our difficulties are Himalayan.
('16', 128, 3, 21, 309255) But we have equally potent means at our disposal for overcoming them.
('16', 128, 3, 22, 309325) We are children of an ancient nation.
('16', 128, 3, 23, 309363) We have witnessed the burial of civilizations: those of Rome, Greece and Egypt.
('16', 128, 3, 24, 309443) Our civilization abides even as the ocean in spite of its ebbs and flows.
('16', 128, 3, 25, 309517) We have all we need to keep ourselves independent.
('16', 128, 3, 26, 309568) We have great mountains and rivers.
('16', 128, 3, 27, 309604) We have the matchless beauty of nature, and the sons and daughters of this land have handed down to us a heritage of deeds of valour.
('16', 128, 3, 28, 309738) This country is the treasure house of tapascharya.
('16', 128, 3, 29, 309789) In this country alone do people belonging to different religions live together in amity and the gods of all are venerated.
('16', 128, 3, 30, 309912) If, despite all this bounty, we fail to work a miracle, bring peace to the world and conquer the British through the play of moral force in our life, we shall have disgraced our heritage.
('16', 128, 3, 31, 310100) The English nation is full of adventure, the religious spirit guides it, it has unquenchable faith in itself, it is a nation of great soldiers, it treasures
('16', 129, 0, 1, 310257) 130 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 129, 1, 2, 310299) its independence; but it has given the place of honour to its commercial instinct, it has not always narrowly examined the means adopted for seeking wealth.
('16', 129, 1, 3, 310456) It worships modern civilization.
('16', 129, 1, 4, 310489) The ancient ideals have lost their hold upon it.
('16', 129, 1, 5, 310538) If, therefore, instead of imitating that nation, we cherish our past and sincerely value our strength, trust firmly in its supremacy, we shall know how to take the best advantage of our connection with the British and so make it profitable to us, to them and to the entire world.
('16', 129, 1, 6, 310818) I pray to the Almighty that this assembly may play its part in this great work and thereby shed lustre upon itself, upon Gujarat, and upon the whole of India.

('16', 129, 4, 10, 311076) November 4, 1917
('16', 129, 5, 11, 311093) 1. This Conference places on record its grief at the demise of the Grand Old Man of India, Dadabhai Naoroji, and offers its condolences to the members of his family.
('16', 129, 5, 12, 311259) It prays to God that the soul of the Mahatma may rest in peace.
('16', 129, 5, 13, 311323) 2. This Conference places on record its grief at the demise of Mr. Abdul Rasool, a prominent leader of the All India Muslim League and the Congress, and offers its condolences to the members of his family.
('16', 129, 5, 14, 311529) It prays to God for the welfare of his soul.
('16', 129, 5, 15, 311574) 3. The itinerary of Mr. Montagu’s tour provides for a stay in Bombay from December 24, 1917, to January 2, 1918, but the leaders of the Province will be in Calcutta during the week, attending sessions of the Congress and the Muslim League there and will therefore be denied the opportunity of joining in the discussions with Mr. Montagu.
('16', 129, 5, 16, 311912) This Conference therefore requests the Government to arrange for Mr. Montagu to spend that week in Calcutta instead of in Bombay.
('16', 129, 5, 17, 312042) 4 This Conference earnestly appeals to the various Congress Committees, the branches of the Home Rule League and other

('16', 130, 4, 6, 312622) [GODHRA,] November 4, 1917
('16', 130, 5, 7, 312649) Before commencing the proceedings, Gandhiji announced the Government’s decision to lift the customs levy at Viramgam: The matter of the customs levy at Viramgam had been under correspondence and I wrote to inquire when it would be removed.
('16', 130, 5, 8, 312889) I am glad to tell you that it is to be removed and that the Government Resolution on the subject will be published in the next issue of the Gazette.
('16', 130, 6, 9, 313038) On Mr. Jinnah 2 moving in Gujarati, the resolution on the Congress League Scheme for Reforms 3, Gandhiji thanked him, saying: Mr. Jinnah has laid me under an obligation by agreeing to my suggestion.
('16', 130, 6, 10, 313237) He is at present a member of the Imperial Legislative Council.
('16', 130, 6, 11, 313300) But, at no distant date, he will have to approach Hindus and
('16', 130, 7, 12, 313361) 1 The reference is to the Home Rule petition drafted by Gandhiji and presented to Montagu; vide “Petition to E.S. Montagu”, Before 13 9 1917 An identical petition was presented on behalf of the people of Bihar and Orissa.
('16', 130, 7, 13, 313583) 2 Mahomed Ali Jinnah (1879 1948); barrister and statesman; first Governor General of Pakistan, of which he was virtually the founder.
('16', 130, 7, 14, 313717) 3 The following brief report appeared in The Bombay Chronicle, 6 11 1917: “Gandhiji, before he called upon Mr. M. A. Jinnah to move the resolution expressing gratefulness of the Conference at the forthcoming visit of Mr. Montagu and praying for the grant of the Congress Muslim League scheme of reforms as the first instalment of the policy recently announced by the Secretary of State, made a few remarks in which he explained the reasons why he left the reading of the resolution to the mover himself and exhorted him to speak in Gujarati.
('16', 130, 7, 15, 314259) “Later, Gandhiji moved from the chair a resolution urging Mr. Montagu to cancel his visit to Bombay at a time when every leader of note would be absent from the city and praying that he might attend the Congress Muslim League sittings at Calcutta.”

('16', 131, 1, 2, 314550) Muslims, Ghanchis 1, Golas 2 and others not knowing English, for votes.
('16', 131, 1, 3, 314622) He should, therefore, learn Gujarati if he does not know it.
('16', 131, 2, 4, 314683) On Lokamanya B. G. Tilak rising to address the meeting, the question arose in what language he should speak.
('16', 131, 2, 5, 314792) Gandhiji remarked: You want to have swaraj; you should then show respect to the man whom you have elected to conduct the meeting.
('16', 131, 2, 6, 314922) Mr. Tilak understands, but he cannot speak Gujarati.
('16', 131, 2, 7, 314975) He will only speak in his mother tongue 3. Though he is advanced in years, it would be but proper if he engages a Gujarati teacher and picks up the language.
('16', 131, 2, 8, 315133) We belong to the Bombay Presidency and should, therefore, learn both languages in order that we might know what the people feel.
('16', 131, 2, 9, 315262) Queen Victoria learned Urdu.

('16', 131, 5, 13, 315377) November 5, 1917
('16', 131, 6, 14, 315394) I am sorry that some of the speakers were not allowed to complete their very fine speeches, and I apologize to them for this.
('16', 131, 6, 15, 315520) Those who have had to suppress their enthusiasm may show it in other ways.
('16', 131, 6, 16, 315595) I must leave this very day, denying myself the love of the people of Godhra.
('16', 131, 6, 17, 315672) I would have had some peace if I had stayed on for a while.
('16', 131, 6, 18, 315732) These days, however, when a fire is raging, how can one expect peace?
('16', 131, 6, 19, 315802) The songs were sweet to hear, but they are not the end of the matter.
('16', 131, 6, 20, 315872) I hope what was sung would be acted upon.
('16', 131, 6, 21, 315914) If you follow up the songs with sacrifices in the cause of the nation, the hopes 5 expressed by Mr. Talati will be fulfilled.
('16', 131, 6, 22, 316040) Take the pledge, if you think you can, to achieve swaraj within 12 months.
('16', 131, 6, 23, 316115) We saw, during

('16', 131, 8, 25, 316183) 3 Marathi 4 This was Gandhiji’s concluding speech.
('16', 131, 8, 26, 316234) The Bombay Chronicle 7 11 1917, reported that “in dissolving the Conference, Mr. Gandhi, in a short speech, exhorted them to continue their propagandist work and to take signatures in the petition to Mr. Montagu.” 5 These were that the first conference after the attainment of swaraj would be held at Nadiad, in Gujarat.

('16', 132, 1, 2, 316601) the Conference, what the mother tongue can do.
('16', 132, 1, 3, 316648) Our language is in the position of a widow with no one to look after her.
('16', 132, 1, 4, 316722) Mr. Khaparde 1
('16', 132, 2, 5, 316737) and others pointed out the virtues of the mother tongue.
('16', 132, 2, 6, 316794) Mr. Tilak’s speech yesterday was followed by about 75 per cent of the audience.
('16', 132, 2, 7, 316874) A foreign language may be as beautiful as gold, but it can be of little use to us.
('16', 132, 2, 8, 316957) Our own language may be mere straw, but it is for us to turn it into gold.
('16', 132, 2, 9, 317032) Of the resolutions passed, five relate to matters which we can get settled in a year’s time.
('16', 132, 2, 10, 317125) As for the resolution on forced labour, if the Executive Committee does not get such labour abolished in that time, the members should resign.
('16', 132, 2, 11, 317268) If, again, they do not succeed in securing improvement in the condition of students, they may as well go about with bangles on their wrists.
('16', 132, 2, 12, 317409) Of course, it will be no great honour to men to do this.
('16', 132, 2, 13, 317466) We have to strive to secure the release of Mahomed Ali and Shaukat Ali.
('16', 132, 2, 14, 317538) The chair of the Muslim League President should not remain vacant.

('16', 132, 6, 18, 317679) CONFERENCE—II 2
('16', 132, 7, 19, 317695) November 5, 1917
('16', 132, 8, 20, 317712) 5. This Conference tenders its thanks to His Excellency the Viceroy for the decision he has announced to remove the levy, known as Viramgam customs, on certain categories of goods on their entry from Kathiawad into British territory, and earnestly requests him to give immediate effect to the decision.
('16', 132, 8, 21, 318015) 6. Farmers without adequate means are put to extreme hardships because of the general practice of collecting revenue dues in one instalment instead of two and are obliged to sell their means of livelihood to pay the dues.
('16', 132, 8, 22, 318237) This Conference therefore requests the Government to see that revenue dues are always collected in two instalments and to fix the time for the collection of instalments with due regard to the crop situation.
('16', 132, 9, 23, 318445) 1 G. S. Khaparde, a leader from Berar, supporter of Bal Gangadhar Tilak 2 These were moved on the third day of the Conference, and were presumably drafted by Gandhiji.

('16', 133, 1, 2, 318655) 7. This Conference is of the view that the Sub divisional Officer of every district should have his residence, during the monsoon months, in the principal town of his division instead of at the district headquarters.
('16', 133, 1, 3, 318872) For some time past, the office of the District Deputy Collector of Dohad is shifted to Godhra during the monsoon months and this results in considerable hardship to the people of Zalod, Bhimdi, etc., and also puts them to heavy expense on transport.
('16', 133, 1, 4, 319122) This Conference therefore requests the Government that the said office should remain in Dohad as in former years.
('16', 133, 2, 5, 319236) 8. This Conference requests the Government of India to release all Indians, men and women, who had been detained for political reasons under the Defence of India Act and declares its view that the desire expressed by His Excellency the Viceroy to see peace prevail in India during Mr. Montagu’s visit here will be better realized if the detenus are released.
('16', 133, 3, 6, 319595) 9. In revenue matters as also for the maintenance of peace and order in his district, the Collector is at present dependent on the one sided reports of the Mamlatdar and the police and this often leads to serious errors in the administration of the district and injustice to the people.
('16', 133, 3, 7, 319882) This Conference therefore recommends to the Government that it appoint an advisory board of elected members for each district.
('16', 133, 3, 8, 320009) 10. Recently, some persons have set up, in disregard of the interests of the people, plants for the processing of milk and the Government has also been doing the same, with the result that people have to go without the nourishing items of milk and ghee in their food.
('16', 133, 3, 9, 320277) This Conference therefore suggests to the Government that such plants be closed forthwith.

('16', 133, 6, 12, 320405) 1 A pamphlet, dated November 5, 1917 and printed at Godhra, gives a longer version of this resolution which, however, is not likely to have been drafted by Gandhiji.
('16', 133, 6, 13, 320571) Besides, the version reproduced here is corroborated by Mumbai Samachar, 8 11 1917.

('16', 134, 2, 3, 320743) November 5, 1917
('16', 134, 3, 4, 320760) MY DEAR BRETHREN, We are in the midst of those people, call them Dheds, Bhangis, Antyajas 2, or by whatever appellation you like.
('16', 134, 3, 5, 320890) Beside me there are lawyers and doctors, I believe, and other gentlemen; we have today joined hands with the so called backward classes; now we are sure to get swaraj.
('16', 134, 3, 6, 321058) (Hear, hear.) We, Hindus and Muhammadans, have become one; here we are in association with this Dhed community.
('16', 134, 3, 7, 321170) Do not suppose that that community belongs to a lower status; let the fusion take place between you and that community, and then you will be fit for swaraj.
('16', 134, 3, 8, 321327) We lost the right to swaraj before, because we committed a sin before God in treating this community with such neglect.
('16', 134, 3, 9, 321447) Why should we hesitate to touch the Antyajas?
('16', 134, 3, 10, 321493) It is not mentioned in any religious book that this community should not be touched, or treated as we are doing now.
('16', 134, 3, 11, 321610) It is a fallacy to give that community the lowest place in the scale of castes.
('16', 134, 3, 12, 321690) Where the union of hearts takes place, there, I am sure, God is present.
('16', 134, 3, 13, 321763) God is omnipotent, though some of us do not believe it.
('16', 134, 3, 14, 321819) Therefore, we quarrel among ourselves.
('16', 134, 3, 15, 321858) Where is the difference between us and this community?
('16', 134, 3, 16, 321913) There is the same heart, the same nose, the same tongue, the same feeling—everything the same.
('16', 134, 3, 17, 322008) (Cheers.) Where there is a divided heart, there Ramachandra cannot be.
('16', 134, 3, 18, 322079) There is no Imam.
('16', 134, 3, 19, 322097) (Laughter.) I do not know whether God was present at the political conference (Laughter.), but I am sure he is here.
('16', 134, 3, 20, 322214) (Hear, hear.) I have not come here to make a long speech; I came to set an object lesson.
('16', 134, 3, 21, 322304) (Hear, hear.) This lesson on social reform is not to be had elsewhere.
('16', 134, 3, 22, 322375) (Cheers.) Here is a vast assemblage.
('16', 134, 3, 23, 322412) It is like an ocean.
('16', 134, 3, 24, 322433) Anyone can use this water for cooking his rice.
('16', 134, 3, 25, 322481) (Laughter.) Let everyone speak.
('16', 134, 3, 26, 322513) I now call upon the Hon’ble Mr. Patel to speak.
('16', 134, 3, 27, 322561) (Loud cheers.)
('16', 134, 4, 28, 322576) A young Dhed then asked permission to speak.
('16', 134, 4, 29, 322621) He came forward very nervously.
('16', 134, 4, 30, 322653) He said that he was not an educated man.
('16', 134, 4, 31, 322694) He was the son of a Dhed.
('16', 134, 4, 32, 322720) He thanked the assembly on behalf of his community and tendered their tribute of love
('16', 134, 5, 33, 322806) 1 At the instance of advanced classes assembled for the Gujarat Political Conference, the Dhed community held a meeting.
('16', 134, 5, 34, 322927) Presiding over the meeting, Gandhiji spoke in Gujarati.
('16', 134, 5, 35, 322983) Abbas Tyabji, Vithalbhai J. Patel, Ratansey Dharamsey, Morarji Gokaldas and others attended.

('16', 135, 1, 2, 323225) and gratitude to the Bawaji (Mr. Patel).
('16', 135, 1, 3, 323266) He gradually grew more confident and endeavoured to substantiate the claim of his community to be among the foremost ranks of the Rajput race.
('16', 135, 2, 4, 323409) Mr. Gandhi rose at once to disillusion him of this, and advised him not to believe in such cock and bull stories regarding his ancestry.
('16', 135, 2, 5, 323546) He admonished the Dheds to be content with their parentage and to rise by their own efforts, now that the
('16', 135, 3, 6, 323652) higher classes had lent them a kindly hand.
('16', 135, 4, 7, 323696) Other speakers followed—all striving to console and encourage Dhed
('16', 135, 5, 8, 323763) community.
('16', 135, 6, 9, 323774) In his final speech Mr. Gandhi asked the upper classes to convert their theoretical sympathy for the Dheds into practical one and to subscribe towards opening and maintaining a school for Dhed children.
('16', 135, 6, 10, 323977) Rs. 1,653 were subscribed on
('16', 135, 7, 11, 324006) the spot.

('16', 135, 10, 14, 324088) November 5, 1917
('16', 135, 11, 15, 324105) I would say to the gentleman 2, on whom I lean for support as I stand, that, if he is a saint within as he is in the outer garb, we shall have swaraj all the sooner for that.
('16', 135, 11, 16, 324280) If he carries on the fight in the Legislative Council dressed like a sadhu, as now, our desire will be fulfilled earlier.
('16', 135, 11, 17, 324402) To my Antyaj brethren, I say this: today, you are sitting in the midst of Hindus and Muslims.
('16', 135, 11, 18, 324496) Hinduism certainly does not say that contact with those who serve us is sinful.
('16', 135, 11, 19, 324576) Despite this crowd, no one has so much as felt his leg squeezed.
('16', 135, 11, 20, 324641) God is there where there is such perfect silence.
('16', 135, 11, 21, 324691) I don’t believe the Political Conference or the Social Conference succeeded in proving that God exists everywhere, but here He is certainly present.
('16', 135, 11, 22, 324840) Where there are hypocrisy, falsehood, inequality and the notion that certain persons may not be touched, Vishnu, Khuda or Rasool cannot be present.
('16', 135, 12, 23, 324988) 1 Gandhiji and others were then garlanded and the meeting dissolved amid shouts of Gandhiji ki jai.
('16', 135, 13, 24, 325088) 2 Vithalbhai J. Patel, who later became the first elected Speaker of the Central Legislative Assembly under the Montagu Chelmsford Reforms.
('16', 135, 13, 25, 325228) He appeared in the garb of a sannyasi at the meeting.

('16', 136, 3, 6, 325489) 51. A STAIN ON INDIA’S FOREHEAD
('16', 136, 4, 7, 325521) [GODHRA, After November 5, 1917]
('16', 136, 5, 8, 325554) That the untouchables are a separate class is a blot on India’s forehead.
('16', 136, 5, 9, 325628) The caste system is a hindrance, not a sin.
('16', 136, 5, 10, 325672) But untouchability is a sin, a great crime, and if Hinduism does not destroy this serpent while there is yet time, it will be devoured by it.
('16', 136, 5, 11, 325814) The untouchables must not be considered as falling outside Hinduism.
('16', 136, 5, 12, 325883) They should be treated as respectable members of Hindu society and should be assigned their varnas according to their vocations.
('16', 136, 5, 13, 326012) The varna system, as I have defined and described it, is not practised by Hinduism today.
('16', 136, 5, 14, 326102) Those who call themselves Brahmins have given up the pursuit of learning.
('16', 136, 5, 15, 326176) They have taken to various other occupations.
('16', 136, 5, 16, 326222) The same is true more or less of the other varnas.
('16', 136, 5, 17, 326273) As a matter of fact, owing to our subjection to foreign rule, we are all slaves and are, in the eyes of the Westerners, untouchables lower even than the Sudras.
('16', 136, 5, 18, 326434) Why does God permit this atrocity?
('16', 136, 5, 19, 326469) Ravana was a rakshasa, but this rakshasi 2 of untouchability is even more terrible than Ravana.
('16', 136, 5, 20, 326565) And when we worship this rakshasi in the name of religion, the gravity of our sins is further increased.
('16', 136, 5, 21, 326670) Even the slavery of the Negroes is better than this.
('16', 136, 5, 22, 326723) This religion, if it can be called such, stinks in my nostrils.
('16', 136, 5, 23, 326787) This certainly cannot be the Hindu religion, It was through the Hindu religion that I learnt to respect Christianity and Islam.
('16', 136, 5, 24, 326915) How then can this sin be a part of the Hindu religion?
('16', 136, 5, 25, 326970) But then what is to be done?
('16', 136, 5, 26, 326999) I shall put up a lone fight, if need be, against this hypocrisy.
('16', 136, 5, 27, 327064) Alone I shall undergo penance and die with His name on my lips.
('16', 136, 5, 28, 327128) It is possible that I may go mad and say that I was mistaken in my views
('16', 136, 6, 29, 327201) 1 An inmate of Sabarmati Ashram who was later responsible for introducing the popular form of charkha, the spinning wheel.

('16', 137, 0, 1, 327339) 138 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 137, 1, 2, 327381) on the question of untouchability, that I was guilty of a sin in calling untouchability a sin of Hinduism.
('16', 137, 1, 3, 327488) Then you should take it that I am frightened, that I cannot face the challenge and that I change my views out of cowardice.
('16', 137, 1, 4, 327612) You should take it, in that event, that I am in delirium.
('16', 137, 2, 5, 327670) In my humble opinion, the dirt that soils the scavenger is physical and can be easily removed.
('16', 137, 2, 6, 327765) But there are those who have become soiled with untruth and hypocrisy, and this dirt is so subtle that it is very difficult to remove it.
('16', 137, 2, 7, 327903) If there are any untouchables, they are the people who are filled with untruth and hypocrisy.
('16', 137, 3, 8, 327997) There has been a lot of comment in Gujarati on the convention of Bhangis, Doms and other untouchables that was held in the Mahar compound of Godhra.
('16', 137, 3, 9, 328146) The writers of these comments have given completely distorted versions of the events at the convention and misled the readers.
('16', 137, 3, 10, 328273) I therefore write the following lines to put things right.
('16', 137, 3, 11, 328332) In matters concerning religion, I consider myself not a child but an adult with 35 years of experience.
('16', 137, 3, 12, 328436) For I have thought and reflected on the question of religion for as many years.
('16', 137, 3, 13, 328516) Especially, wherever I saw truth, I translated it into action.
('16', 137, 3, 14, 328579) It is my conviction that mere perusal of the shastras does not lead to an awareness of the true spirit of religion.
('16', 137, 3, 15, 328695) We see that without following a code of rules, without the study of the shastras, a man’s behaviour tends to be wayward.
('16', 137, 3, 16, 328816) For the meaning of a doctrine I shall not go to a man who has studied the shastras with the desire to be called a pundit.
('16', 137, 3, 17, 328938) For this reason, for formulating my code of ethics I shall not seek the assistance of the books written after laborious study by such scholars as Max Muller.
('16', 137, 3, 18, 329096) Nowadays lots of people who profess themselves knowledgeable in the shastras are found to be ignorant and conceited.
('16', 137, 3, 19, 329213) I seek a guru.
('16', 137, 3, 20, 329228) That a guru is needed I accept.
('16', 137, 3, 21, 329260) But, as long as I have not come upon a worthy guru, I shall continue to be my own guru.
('16', 137, 3, 22, 329348) The path is arduous certainly, but in this sinful age, it seems to be the right one.
('16', 137, 3, 23, 329433) Hinduism is so great and so wide in sweep that no one has so far succeeded in defining it.
('16', 137, 3, 24, 329524) I was born in the Vaishnavisam sect
('16', 137, 4, 25, 329560) 1 The paragraphs that follow were substantially embodied by Gandhiji in a letter which he addressed to Gujarati in connection with certain comments in that paper on the Antyaj Conference in Godhra on November 5. The letter was published in its issue of 30 12 1917.
('16', 138, 0, 1, 329825) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 139
('16', 138, 1, 2, 329871) and I dearly love its siddhas 1 and siddhantas 2. Nowhere, either in Vaishnavism or in Hinduism, have I seen it laid down that Bhangis, Doms, etc., are untouchables.
('16', 138, 1, 3, 330037) 3 Hinduism is hemmed in by many old customs.
('16', 138, 1, 4, 330082) Some of them are praiseworthy but the rest are to be condemned.
('16', 138, 1, 5, 330146) The custom of untouchability is, of course, to be condemned altogether.
('16', 138, 1, 6, 330218) It is because of it that, now for two thousand years, Hinduism has been burdened with a load of sin in the name of religion.
('16', 138, 1, 7, 330343) I call such orthodoxy hypocrisy.
('16', 138, 1, 8, 330376) You will have to free yourself of this hypocrisy; the penance for it you are already undergoing.
('16', 138, 1, 9, 330473) It is no good quoting verses from Manusmriti and other scriptures in defence of this orthodoxy.
('16', 138, 1, 10, 330569) A number of verses in these scriptures are apocryphal, a number of them are quite meaningless.
('16', 138, 1, 11, 330664) Then again, I have not so far come across any Hindu who obeys or wants to obey every injunction contained in Manusmriti.
('16', 138, 1, 12, 330785) And it is easy to prove that one who does this will, in the end, be himself polluted.
('16', 138, 1, 13, 330871) The Sanatana Dharma will not be saved by defending every verse printed in the scriptures.
('16', 138, 1, 14, 330961) It will be saved only by putting into action the principles enunciated in them—principles that are eternal.
('16', 138, 1, 15, 331069) All the religious leaders with whom I have had occasion to discuss the matter have agreed in this.
('16', 138, 1, 16, 331168) All the preachers who are counted among the learned and who are revered in society have clearly announced that our treatment of Bhangis, Doms, etc., has no sanction other than the custom to which it conforms.
('16', 138, 1, 17, 331377) To be truthful, no one really follows this custom.
('16', 138, 1, 18, 331428) We touch them in the trains.
('16', 138, 1, 19, 331457) They are employed in mills where we touch them without the least compunction.
('16', 138, 1, 20, 331535) Untouchables have found admission in the Fergusson and the Baroda Colleges.
('16', 138, 1, 21, 331611) Society puts no hindrance so far as these matters are concerned.
('16', 138, 1, 22, 331676) In English and Muslim homes they are politely welcomed.
('16', 138, 1, 23, 331732) And we have no hesitation in touching Englishmen and Muslims; in fact, we feel a pride in shaking hands with many of these.
('16', 138, 1, 24, 331856) When these same untouchables are converted to Christianity, we dare not treat them as untouchables.
('16', 138, 1, 25, 331956) Thus, it is impossible for a thoughtful Hindu, even if he feels differently in the matter, to uphold a tradition which it is not possible to follow.
('16', 138, 1, 26, 332105) I can think of no epithet to describe those who deny the feeling
('16', 138, 2, 27, 332170) 1 The enlightened or perfect ones 2 Principles, established truths 3 Here the letter in Gujarati has: “According to Akha, the prejudice against such contact is like a superfluous limb.”

('16', 139, 1, 2, 332398) of hatred which underlines untouchability.
('16', 139, 1, 3, 332441) If a Bhangi by mistake finds his way into our compartment, he will hardly escape a beating and, as for abuse, this will fall on him in a shower.
('16', 139, 1, 4, 332586) The tea seller will not hand him tea nor the shopkeeper sell him goods.
('16', 139, 1, 5, 332658) We will not care to touch him even if he be dying.
('16', 139, 1, 6, 332709) We give him our leavings to eat and our torn and soiled garments to wear.
('16', 139, 1, 7, 332783) No Hindu is willing to teach him.
('16', 139, 1, 8, 332817) He cannot dwell in a proper house.
('16', 139, 1, 9, 332852) On the road, out of fear of our wrath, he has to proclaim his untouchability repeatedly.
('16', 139, 1, 10, 332941) What treatment can be more indicative of hatred than this ?
('16', 139, 1, 11, 333001) What does this condition of his show ?
('16', 139, 1, 12, 333040) Just as in Europe, at one time, slavery was upheld under cover of religion, so now in our society hatred for the untouchables is fostered in the name of religion.
('16', 139, 1, 13, 333203) Till the very end there were some people in Europe who quoted the Bible in defence of slavery.
('16', 139, 1, 14, 333298) I include our present supporters of orthodoxy in this category.
('16', 139, 1, 15, 333362) We shall have to free religion of the sin of untouchability which is imputed to it.
('16', 139, 1, 16, 333446) Unless we do this, diseases like plague, cholera, etc., cannot be rooted out.
('16', 139, 1, 17, 333524) There is nothing lowly in the occupations of the untouchables.
('16', 139, 1, 18, 333587) Doctors as well as our mothers perform similar duties.
('16', 139, 1, 19, 333642) It may be argued that they cleanse themselves afterwards.
('16', 139, 1, 20, 333700) Yes, but if Bhangis, etc., do not do so, the fault is wholly ours and not theirs.
('16', 139, 1, 21, 333782) It is clear that the moment we begin lovingly to hug them, they will begin to learn to be clean.
('16', 139, 2, 22, 333879) Unlike the movement for inter dining, this movement does not need to be pushed.
('16', 139, 2, 23, 333959) This movement will not cause the system of Varnashram to disappear.
('16', 139, 2, 24, 334027) It aims at saving it by doing away with its excesses.
('16', 139, 2, 25, 334081) It is also not the desire of the initiators of this movement that Bhangis, etc., should give up their vocations.
('16', 139, 2, 26, 334194) They only want to demonstrate that the function of removing garbage and filth is a necessary and sacred function and its performance can impart grace even to a Vaishnava.
('16', 139, 2, 27, 334365) Those who pursue this vocation are not, therefore, degraded but entitled to an equal measure of social privileges with those pursuing other callings; their work protects the country from a number of diseases.
('16', 139, 2, 28, 334574) They, therefore, deserve the same respect as doctors.
('16', 139, 3, 29, 334628) While this country is venerated for its tapasya, purity, compassion and other virtues, it is also a play ground of licence, sin, barbarity and other vices.
('16', 139, 3, 30, 334784) At such a juncture it will be becoming for our fraternity of writers to gird up their loins to oppose and root out hypocrisy.
('16', 139, 3, 31, 334910) I appeal to you to share in the sacred work that was taken

('16', 140, 1, 3, 335184) Before joining this campaign, I have thoroughly reflected on my religious responsibility.
('16', 140, 1, 4, 335274) A critic has made the prophecy that, in course of time, my views will change.
('16', 140, 1, 5, 335352) 1 On this I shall only say that, before such a tune comes, I shall have forsaken not only Hinduism but all religion.
('16', 140, 1, 6, 335469) But it is my firm conviction that if, in the attempt to free Hinduism of this blot, I have to lay down my life, it will be no great matter.
('16', 140, 1, 7, 335609) It is altogether impossible for the feeling of untouchability to survive in a religion which produced devotees like Narsi Mehta who saw all men as equals [From Hindi]

('16', 140, 4, 10, 335821) November 11, 1917
('16', 140, 5, 11, 335839) FRIENDS, I had intended to speak of three things only, but what I saw at the station has added one more.
('16', 140, 5, 12, 335944) Wherever I go, our people, forgetting everything in their love, so rush at me and throw everything into such confusion that I grow weary of it all.
('16', 140, 5, 13, 336092) This kind of behaviour makes things unpleasant and obstructs national work.
('16', 140, 5, 14, 336168) If we wish to honour a public worker, there is a way of doing so and one should learn it.
('16', 140, 5, 15, 336258) Our people do not even know how to maintain order as they stand on the station platform.
('16', 140, 5, 16, 336347) We want to work for the nation.
('16', 140, 5, 17, 336379) We have embarked on the service of Bharat.
('16', 140, 5, 18, 336422) It is our duty then to learn how to behave in public, how to go about our work and how to honour public servants.
('16', 140, 5, 19, 336536) We should learn drill for this purpose.
('16', 140, 5, 20, 336576) The second thing is about Champaran.
('16', 140, 5, 21, 336613) The people there have secured what they wanted.
('16', 140, 5, 22, 336661) 3 We had no quarrel with the indigo planters; we only wanted to shake off our slavery to them and this is
('16', 140, 6, 23, 336767) 1 In Gujarati, the example of Narmadashankar has been cited here.
('16', 140, 6, 24, 336833) 2 An indirect report, available from Bihar Orissa Abstracts, 1917, recorded that five to seven thousand people attended the meeting.
('16', 140, 6, 25, 336966) 3 The Champaran satyagraha which Gandhiji led resulted in the removal of tinkathia, a levy on the indigo labourers.
('16', 141, 0, 1, 337082) 142 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 141, 1, 2, 337124) all we have been able to achieve.
('16', 141, 1, 3, 337158) The orders issued for the benefit of the people there do not apply to Muzaffarpur; I believe, however, that they will be, by and by.
('16', 141, 1, 4, 337291) If we fail to secure anything, it is merely because of want of trust between us and those from whom we seek it.
('16', 141, 1, 5, 337403) When I started my work in Champaran, the indigo planters and the officials there felt that I was out to fight them; when, ultimately, they realized that I had no such intention, that I only wanted the indigo planters to be just to the people, there was little difficulty in getting what we wanted.
('16', 141, 2, 6, 337701) The work at Champaran is over, but something still more important remains.
('16', 141, 2, 7, 337776) If a man who has shaken off slavery and gained his freedom is not properly educated, he may possibly abuse his freedom.
('16', 141, 2, 8, 337896) The people of Champaran have secured local self government of a sort.
('16', 141, 2, 9, 337966) How it is to be used is the problem now.
('16', 141, 2, 10, 338007) For this purpose my co workers, Babu Brijkishore 1 and others, have jointly decided to open schools all over the place and educate the people in general knowledge, especially in the rules of hygiene.
('16', 141, 2, 11, 338207) The intention is to give instruction in letters to boys and girls and teach them as much hygiene as they need to keep themselves clean and tidy, and teach adults how to safeguard public health and keep clean the roads, disused wells, latrines, etc.
('16', 141, 2, 12, 338456) With this object, a school is to be opened in a place called Dhaka on the auspicious day of Tuesday.
('16', 141, 2, 13, 338557) There is an urgent need of volunteers for this world.
('16', 141, 2, 14, 338611) Any educated friends who so desire may come forward.
('16', 141, 2, 15, 338664) Those who do will be examined and such of them as are found fit will be taken up.
('16', 141, 3, 16, 338746) The third matter is this.
('16', 141, 3, 17, 338772) What shall we do to bridge the gulf that exists between Hindus and Muslims and bring together hearts that have become estranged?
('16', 141, 3, 18, 338901) It is my life’s mission to bring about amity between the two communities.
('16', 141, 3, 19, 338975) For 25 years I have been thinking how this may be done and have been mixing with Muslim friends.
('16', 141, 3, 20, 339072) What I hear about Shahabad pierces my heart and makes it bleed.
('16', 141, 3, 21, 339136) 2 If I could, I would have run up to the place and had a heart to heart talk with our Muslim brethren there.
('16', 141, 3, 22, 339245) But I know my limitations.
('16', 141, 3, 23, 339272) The Champaran
('16', 141, 4, 24, 339286) 1 Brijkishore Prasad, leading lawyer of Darbhanga; staunch nationalist and close follower of Gandhiji with whom he worked in 1917 during the Agrarian Movement in Champaran; in 1920, gave up legal practice to join Non Co operation Movement 2 The reference is to the riots which had broken out there during September October.
('16', 142, 0, 1, 339610) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 143
('16', 142, 1, 2, 339656) matter is not yet out of the way and it is a principle of mine that one must live and die for the work on hand till it is brought to a successful issue.
('16', 142, 1, 3, 339809) But I have been thinking about the problem, and should like to tell my Hindu brethren that we have grievously erred on this occasion, that we are more to blame.
('16', 142, 1, 4, 339970) It is the duty of the wiser among the Hindus to heal the Muslims’ wounds and compensate them for the losses we have inflicted on them in Arrah.
('16', 142, 1, 5, 340114) I would even go to the extent of saying that, if Shahabad Hindus cannot do this, Hindus all over the country should combine to do it.
('16', 142, 1, 6, 340248) The lawyer friends who have been fighting in the courts, on the two sides, should withdraw the cases and inform the Government that they do not now want them to be proceeded with.
('16', 142, 1, 7, 340428) To Muslim friends, I shall say that the fighting between the two communities in one district need not be made an excuse for fighting all over India.
('16', 142, 1, 8, 340577) Even two brothers sometimes fight, but they should not be allowed to disrupt the family as a whole.
('16', 142, 1, 9, 340677) In like manner, the two communities here need not take their quarrel outside the Province.
('16', 142, 1, 10, 340768) We must, as a matter of religious duty, help the Muslim League and the Congress to accomplish the task they have undertaken.
('16', 142, 1, 11, 340893) Our leaders have bestowed full thought on what they are doing and we have, therefore, no right to obstruct their efforts.
('16', 142, 1, 12, 341015) We are preparing ourselves for swaraj and, if we waste our time in fighting in this manner, our descendants will have cause to blame us.
('16', 142, 1, 13, 341152) It is up to us to settle our differences, but we seem incapable of doing so.
('16', 142, 1, 14, 341229) One reason for our fighting is that we receive our education through a foreign tongue.
('16', 142, 1, 15, 341316) This has cost us our courage and our manhood.
('16', 142, 1, 16, 341362) Besides, we have lost contact with the masses; there is a big gulf separating our educated class and the masses.
('16', 142, 1, 17, 341475) With better relations between the educated and the rest, such unseemly fighting would be impossible.
('16', 142, 1, 18, 341576) The differences between Hindus and Muslims are over the cow.
('16', 142, 1, 19, 341637) If we want cows to be protected, the thing to do is to save them from slaughter houses.
('16', 142, 1, 20, 341725) Not less than 30,000 cows and calves are killed for the British every day.
('16', 142, 1, 21, 341800) While we have not succeeded in stopping this slaughter, we have no right to raise our hand against Muslims.
('16', 142, 1, 22, 341908) I should like to tell the Hindus that it is no religious act to kill Muslims in order to save cows.
('16', 142, 1, 23, 342008) Hinduism prescribes only one way: that of tapascharya.
('16', 142, 1, 24, 342063) To quote Tulsidasji, compassion is the root that sustains one in dharma; we should, accordingly, approach this work in the spirit of compassion.
('16', 142, 1, 25, 342208) I also want cows to be protected but, for that purpose, I would ask the Muslim friends to apply the knife to my
('16', 143, 0, 1, 342320) 144 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 143, 1, 2, 342362) neck and kill me rather than the cow.
('16', 143, 1, 3, 342400) I am sure they will respond to this prayerful request.
('16', 143, 1, 4, 342455) If we cherish our own freedom, we have no right to deprive others of theirs.
('16', 143, 1, 5, 342532) Interference with one another’s freedom leads to strained relations.
('16', 143, 1, 6, 342601) If a Muslim arrogantly asks Hindus not to play on drums [near a mosque], the latter will never agree.
('16', 143, 1, 7, 342703) If, however, the Muslims were to say in all humility, “Please do not play on drums and disturb us in the performance of our religious duty, in our devotions; if you do, we will lay down our lives,” I am sure there is no Hindu so thoughtless as to act against their wishes.
('16', 143, 1, 8, 342976) The truth is that in this matter neither the Hindu nor the Muslim is being honest.
('16', 143, 1, 9, 343059) If we want harmony, we can have it through love; never through intimidation, [for] the other party will not speak out frankly what it really feels.
('16', 143, 2, 10, 343207) I have been saying that there should be a single national language, and that this should be Hindi.
('16', 143, 2, 11, 343306) This, I hear, has created some misunderstanding among Muslims.
('16', 143, 2, 12, 343369) Some of them imagine that, in advocating Hindi, I ignore the claims of Urdu.
('16', 143, 2, 13, 343446) By Hindi I mean the language spoken by Hindus and Muslims in North India and written in Nagari and Urdu scripts.
('16', 143, 2, 14, 343559) I am in no way ill disposed to the Urdu language.
('16', 143, 2, 15, 343609) In my view, the two languages are one; they have a common structure and idiom, except for the difference in respect of the use of Sanskrit and Persian words.
('16', 143, 2, 16, 343767) I bear English no grudge, but it will not help us to mix with the masses and work among them like one of themselves.
('16', 143, 2, 17, 343884) This is all I mean.
('16', 143, 2, 18, 343904) Whether you speak of Hindustani or Hindi, to me they mean the same.
('16', 143, 2, 19, 343972) It is our duty to carry on national work through Hindi.
('16', 143, 2, 20, 344028) As for the script, no harm will be done if the Hindu boy uses the Nagari and the Muslim boy uses the Urdu; on the contrary, each will have learnt both the scripts.
('16', 143, 2, 21, 344192) Among ourselves, we should hear only Hindi words, not English.
('16', 143, 2, 22, 344255) Not only this, our councils, too, should resound with debates in Hindi.
('16', 143, 2, 23, 344327) I shall struggle all my life to bring this about.
('16', 143, 3, 24, 344377) I have but one thing more to say: all over India, we are agitating for swaraj.
('16', 143, 3, 25, 344456) We have realized from the experience of the Shahabad riots why swaraj is being delayed.
('16', 143, 3, 26, 344544) It will not come with petitions and speeches.
('16', 143, 3, 27, 344590) If the Hindu is out to shed Muslim blood in order to save the cow, swaraj will never come.
('16', 143, 3, 28, 344681) If harmony is restored between the two communities and they declare that they will themselves settle their differences and guarantee that there will be no need for third party intervention, swaraj will be ours.
('16', 143, 3, 29, 344892) It does not require spread of
('16', 144, 0, 1, 344922) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 145
('16', 144, 1, 2, 344968) education; the only requisite is amity among us, and strength.
('16', 144, 1, 3, 345031) We should cultivate fearlessness before we can achieve swaraj.
('16', 144, 1, 4, 345094) While we have the spark of the Divine in us, never need we fear any human being.

('16', 144, 5, 8, 345273) November 12, 1917
('16', 144, 6, 9, 345291) FRIENDS, I have been invited to declare open this library, named after Gokhale, and to unveil his portrait.
('16', 144, 6, 10, 345399) This is a sacred mission, and a solemn one.
('16', 144, 6, 11, 345443) These days people in the West are obsessed with the idea that in founding a library one renders social service.
('16', 144, 6, 12, 345555) An American city has a millionaire, Carnegie by name.
('16', 144, 6, 13, 345609) He is so rich that, even if he were to distribute rupees by the million among the people, his hoard of wealth would not be exhausted.
('16', 144, 6, 14, 345743) He donates libraries at innumerable places, all named after him.
('16', 144, 6, 15, 345808) Some Scottish leaders requested him not to import such a practice into their country against their wishes, for [they said] it was likely to do much more harm than good.
('16', 144, 6, 16, 345977) In Paris, libraries are being increasingly misused.
('16', 144, 6, 17, 346029) You need not understand from this that I am against libraries.
('16', 144, 6, 18, 346092) When a library is being started, and before deciding to start it, one should consider after whom it is to be named and what kinds of books it should make available to the townspeople, so that the library may be [suitably] named and its books read to some purpose.
('16', 144, 7, 19, 346356) 1 The Bihar Orissa Police Abstracts recorded that finally Gandhiji spoke about the Home Rule Movement and exhorted all to support the recommendations of the Muslim League and the Indian National Congress.
('16', 144, 7, 20, 346561) He appealed to the audience to sign the petition prepared for presentation to Montagu, which he explained.
('16', 144, 7, 21, 346668) Later that evening, Gandhiji attended a Conference of Hindu and Muslim leaders and took part in the discussion.
('16', 144, 7, 22, 346780) According to a confidential report dated November 12, 1917, from the Superintendent of Police, Muzaffarpur, ‘‘Mr. Gandhi condemned the Shahabad disturbance and expressed his sorrow....Mr. Gandhi said that it is not his intention that Hindi should be adopted and not Urdu.
('16', 144, 7, 23, 347052) He said that foreign language should not be adopted and only a language be adopted which is understood by all.
('16', 144, 7, 24, 347163) He said that Hindi and Urdu are mostly spoken and readily understood.” 2 In Gujarat

('16', 145, 1, 2, 347289) And now about the portrait.
('16', 145, 1, 3, 347317) Not only was Gokhale not hungry for fame, he did not even like being honoured in public.
('16', 145, 1, 4, 347406) Often, on such occasions, he would cast his eyes down.
('16', 145, 1, 5, 347461) If you believe that, when his portrait is unveiled, his soul will rest in peace, you are mistaken.
('16', 145, 1, 6, 347560) This great man, when dying, thus declared his cherished wish: “After I am dead, my biography will be written, my statues will be put up and condolence meetings will be held; all this will avail but little to bring peace to my soul.
('16', 145, 1, 7, 347792) My only wish is that the whole of India live as I have lived and that the Servants of India Society which I have established prosper.” They who are prepared to abide by this testament are entitled to unveil Gokhale’s portrait.
('16', 145, 2, 8, 348019) Gokhale’s was a life of extensive activities.
('16', 145, 2, 9, 348065) Today, I shall relate some incidents in his domestic life for the benefit of the women assembled here.
('16', 145, 2, 10, 348168) It is an example for them to follow, for Gokhale served his family very well.
('16', 145, 2, 11, 348246) He never acted in a manner which would cause pain to anyone in the family.
('16', 145, 2, 12, 348321) He refused to follow the current practice in Hindu society of marrying off a girl, doll fashion, as soon as she reached the age of eight and so cast her away to sink in the sea.
('16', 145, 2, 13, 348499) His daughter is still unmarried.
('16', 145, 2, 14, 348532) He had to go through much in keeping her so.
('16', 145, 2, 15, 348577) Moreover, he lost his wife while he was yet in the bloom of youth.
('16', 145, 2, 16, 348644) He could have married again, but he did not.
('16', 145, 2, 17, 348689) He served his family in many ways; ordinarily everyone does so.
('16', 145, 2, 18, 348753) One may, however, serve one’s family either out of self interest or to advance the interests of the nation.
('16', 145, 2, 19, 348861) Gokhale had renounced all considerations of self interest.
('16', 145, 2, 20, 348920) He did his duty by the family, and then the town and then the country, as occasion demanded, with an undaunted spirit, with perseverance and labour.
('16', 145, 3, 21, 349069) In Gokhale’s mind there was not a trace of the feeling that Hindus and Muslims are different.
('16', 145, 3, 22, 349163) He regarded all with an equal eye and with affection.
('16', 145, 3, 23, 349217) He would get angry sometimes, but the anger was provoked only by concern for national interests and it had invariably a wholesome effect on the other party.
('16', 145, 3, 24, 349374) It even converted many Europeans who had been hostile into close friends.
('16', 145, 4, 25, 349448) Anyone who looks at Gokhale’s life, the whole of it, will see that he had made it synonymous with national service.
('16', 145, 4, 26, 349564) He left this world of sorrow before he was fifty, and the only reason for this is that all the twenty four hours of the day he laboured indefatigably, using up his mental and physical energies in the service of the nation.
('16', 145, 4, 27, 349787) Never did he allow the petty concern for himself and his family to enter his mind.
('16', 146, 0, 1, 349870) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 147
('16', 146, 1, 2, 349916) The only thing that concerned him was what he could do for the country.
('16', 146, 2, 3, 349988) Gokhale, this high souled man, was also daily exercised over the issue of the uplift of the Antyaj communities, who constitute a great source of strength for the country, and he laboured in many ways to raise them up.
('16', 146, 2, 4, 350206) If anyone commented on this, he would reply plainly that contact with an Antyaj was no defilement, that, on the contrary, one committed a heinous sin by entertaining the evil prejudice against such contact.
('16', 146, 3, 5, 350413) When I went to see how the Meghwad 1 brethren here weave, I was surprised to hear the children accompanying me talk of defilement.
('16', 146, 3, 6, 350544) While I don’t wish to take up on this occasion the subject of caste, I shall certainly say that, unless we assimilate these classes, one can hope for no improvement in one’s town or in the country.
('16', 146, 3, 7, 350742) If you have any hopes for swaraj, you will be disappointed.
('16', 146, 3, 8, 350802) So long as you have not shaken off unthinking faith, so long as dissensions continue in the home, the family, the town and society as a whole, so long will you shout in vain for swaraj.
('16', 146, 3, 9, 350988) Formerly, there were 50 looms in Umreth and now only two remain, and even these are none too prosperous.
('16', 146, 3, 10, 351093) The reason is to be sought in your narrow outlook.
('16', 146, 3, 11, 351144) It is the duty of the leaders here that they develop the local industries and secure patronage for them.
('16', 146, 3, 12, 351249) If they do not show such concern, they are not entitled to put up the portrait of a saint like Gokhale, dedicated to service of others.
('16', 146, 3, 13, 351385) I don’t think, however, that Umreth is altogether devoid of spirit.
('16', 146, 3, 14, 351453) It is a matter of satisfaction that it has expressed regard for Mahatma Gokhale and has recognized his achievements.

('16', 147, 2, 3, 351686) [Before November 14, 1917]
('16', 147, 3, 4, 351713) I promised the Editor a contribution for the Diwali 1 Number of Hindustan.
('16', 147, 3, 5, 351788) I find that I have no time to make good the promise, but, thinking that I must write something, I place before the readers my views on newspapers.
('16', 147, 3, 6, 351935) Under pressure of circumstances, I had to work in a newspaper office in South Africa and this gave me an opportunity to think on the subject.
('16', 147, 3, 7, 352077) I have put into practice all the ideas which I venture to advance here.
('16', 147, 3, 8, 352149) In my humble opinion, it is wrong to use a newspaper as a means of earning a living.
('16', 147, 3, 9, 352234) There are certain spheres of work which are of such consequence and have such bearing on public welfare that to undertake them for earning one’s livelihood will defeat the primary aim behind them.
('16', 147, 3, 10, 352431) When, further, a newspaper is treated as a means of making profits, the result is likely to be serious malpractices.
('16', 147, 3, 11, 352548) It is not necessary to prove to those who have some experience of journalism that such malpractices do prevail on a large scale.
('16', 147, 3, 12, 352677) Newspapers are meant primarily to educate the people.
('16', 147, 3, 13, 352731) They make the latter familiar with contemporary history.
('16', 147, 3, 14, 352788) This is a work of no mean responsibility.
('16', 147, 3, 15, 352830) It is a fact, however, that readers cannot always trust newspapers.
('16', 147, 3, 16, 352898) Often facts are found to be quite the opposite of what has been reported.
('16', 147, 3, 17, 352972) If newspapers realized that it was their duty to educate the people, they could not but wait to check a report before publishing it.
('16', 147, 3, 18, 353105) It is true that, often, they have to work under difficult conditions.
('16', 147, 3, 19, 353175) They have to sift the true from the false in but a short time and can only guess at the truth.
('16', 147, 3, 20, 353270) Even then, I am of opinion that it is better not to publish a report at all if it has not been found possible to verify it.
('16', 147, 3, 21, 353394) The reporting of speeches in Indian newspapers is generally defective.
('16', 147, 3, 22, 353465) There are very few who can take down a speech verbatim, so that speeches are generally found to be a mere hotchpotch.
('16', 147, 3, 23, 353583) The best thing to do would be to send the proofs of the reported speech to the speaker for correction and the paper should publish its own report of the speech only if the speaker does not correct anything in the proofs sent to him.
('16', 147, 4, 24, 353816) 1 The Hindu festival of lights, celebrated at the end of the autumn harvest with ceremonial worship of Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth.
('16', 147, 4, 25, 353951) According to the Gujarati calendar, it is the last day of the year.
('16', 148, 0, 1, 354019) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 149
('16', 148, 1, 2, 354065) It is often observed that newspapers publish any matter that they have, just to fill in space.
('16', 148, 1, 3, 354160) This practice is almost universal.
('16', 148, 1, 4, 354195) It is so in the West, too.
('16', 148, 1, 5, 354222) The reason is that most newspapers have their eye on profits.
('16', 148, 1, 6, 354284) There is no doubt that newspapers have done great service.
('16', 148, 1, 7, 354343) Their defects are therefore overlooked.
('16', 148, 1, 8, 354383) But, to my mind, they have done no less harm.
('16', 148, 1, 9, 354429) There are newspapers in the West which are so full of trash that it will be a sin even to touch them.
('16', 148, 1, 10, 354531) Many, full of prejudices, create or increase ill will among people.
('16', 148, 1, 11, 354599) At times, they produce bitterness and strife even between different families and communities.
('16', 148, 1, 12, 354693) Thus, newspapers cannot escape criticism merely because they serve the people.
('16', 148, 1, 13, 354772) On the whole, it would seem that the existence of newspapers promotes good and evil in equal measure.
('16', 148, 2, 14, 354874) It is now an established practice with newspapers to depend for revenues mainly on advertisements rather than on subscriptions.
('16', 148, 2, 15, 355002) The result has been deplorable.
('16', 148, 2, 16, 355034) The very newspaper which writes against the drink evil publishes advertisements in praise of drink.
('16', 148, 2, 17, 355134) In the same issue, we read of the harmful effects of tobacco as also from where to buy it.
('16', 148, 2, 18, 355225) Or we shall find the same issue of a paper carrying a long advertisement for a certain play and denouncing that play as well.
('16', 148, 2, 19, 355351) Medical advertisements are the largest source of revenue, though they have done, and are still doing, incalculable harm to the people.
('16', 148, 2, 20, 355486) These medical advertisements almost wholly offset the services rendered by newspapers.
('16', 148, 2, 21, 355573) I have been an eye witness to the harm done by them.
('16', 148, 2, 22, 355626) Many people are lured into buying harmful medicines.
('16', 148, 2, 23, 355679) Many of these promote immorality.
('16', 148, 2, 24, 355713) Such advertisements find a place even in papers run to further the cause of religion.
('16', 148, 2, 25, 355799) This practice has come entirely from the West.
('16', 148, 2, 26, 355846) No matter at what cost or effort, we must put an end to this undesirable practice or, at least, reform it.
('16', 148, 2, 27, 355953) It is the duty of every newspaper to exercise some restraint in the matter of advertisements.
('16', 148, 3, 28, 356047) The last question to consider is: What is the duty of newspapers when laws like the Seditious Writings Act and the Defence of India Act are in force?
('16', 148, 3, 29, 356197) We often find our papers guilty of equivocation.
('16', 148, 3, 30, 356246) Some have perfected this method into a science.
('16', 148, 3, 31, 356294) But, in my opinion this harms the country.
('16', 148, 3, 32, 356337) People become weak and equivocation becomes a habit with them.
('16', 148, 3, 33, 356400) This changes the form of language: instead of being a medium for the expression of one’s thoughts, it becomes a mask for concealing them.
('16', 148, 3, 34, 356538) I am convinced that this is not the way to develop strength in the people.
('16', 148, 3, 35, 356613) The people, both collectively and individually, must cultivate the habit of speaking only
('16', 149, 0, 1, 356703) 150 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 149, 1, 2, 356745) what is in their minds.
('16', 149, 1, 3, 356769) Newspapers are a good means of such education, for those who would evade these laws had better not bring out a paper at all; the other course is to ignore the laws in question and state one’s real views fearlessly but respectfully and bear the consequences.
('16', 149, 1, 4, 357027) Mr. Justice Stephen has said somewhere that a man who has no treason in his heart can speak no treason.
('16', 149, 1, 5, 357131) If it is there in the heart, one should speak it out.
('16', 149, 1, 6, 357185) If one does not have the courage for this, one should stop publishing a newspaper.
('16', 149, 1, 7, 357268) This is in the best interests of all.

('16', 149, 4, 11, 357397) [On or before November 14, 1917]
('16', 149, 5, 12, 357430) The women whom this message reaches are likely to have had some measure of education.
('16', 149, 5, 13, 357516) I wish, therefore, to consider one thing.
('16', 149, 5, 14, 357558) What should educated women do for their illiterate sisters ?
('16', 149, 5, 15, 357619) This is a very important issue.
('16', 149, 5, 16, 357651) Beyond question, if women choose, they can attain a far greater measure of success in this field than men can ever do.
('16', 149, 5, 17, 357770) At present, we do not find many women taking to this work.
('16', 149, 5, 18, 357829) That is, I believe, not their fault but that of their education.
('16', 149, 5, 19, 357894) The first thing, therefore, which educated women must do is to try and see that their sisters do not fall a victim to it.
('16', 149, 5, 20, 358016) Modern education fails utterly to prepare women for their distinctive role; this is not questioned by anyone.
('16', 149, 5, 21, 358126) I do not wish here to examine the shortcomings of modern education or to bother you with the question how they may be overcome.
('16', 149, 5, 22, 358254) All that I desire is that educated women should make this question their own and that those of them with some experience should dedicate their all to rouse Gujarat over it and focus attention on the right lines [of reform].
('16', 149, 5, 23, 358478) Educated women have no contact with those not educated; often, they don’t welcome such contacts.
('16', 149, 5, 24, 358575) This disease must be cured.
('16', 149, 5, 25, 358603) It is necessary that educated women are made conscious of their most obvious duty.
('16', 149, 5, 26, 358686) Men also are not free from faults of this kind, but women need not follow in their footsteps.
('16', 149, 5, 27, 358780) They have the power, denied to men, of creating new ideals and translating them into action.
('16', 149, 5, 28, 358873) By comparison, man is thoughtless, impatient and given to the pursuit
('16', 149, 6, 29, 358943) 1 This was sent before the Gujarati New Year’s Day.

('16', 150, 1, 2, 359041) of novelty.
('16', 150, 1, 3, 359053) Woman, it is observed, is serious minded, patient and inclined generally to cling to old ways.
('16', 150, 1, 4, 359148) When, therefore, she has a new idea, it seems to have its birth in the tender depths of her heart.
('16', 150, 1, 5, 359247) An idea born in this manner commands her unshakable faith and, for that reason, it is capable of being rapidly propagated.
('16', 150, 1, 6, 359370) I believe therefore that, if educated women give up copying the ways of men and think independently about the important questions affecting their sex, we shall find it quite easy to solve many a knotty problem.
('16', 150, 2, 7, 359581) The problem of widows is not quite a simple one.
('16', 150, 2, 8, 359630) It is a worthy cause to which quite a few women can dedicate their lives.
('16', 150, 2, 9, 359704) It is one thing for a widow to marry again, if she so desires, quite another to waste one’s time over persuading a child widow to do so.
('16', 150, 2, 10, 359841) If women were to resolve, instead, and induce others to resolve, not to marry a widower or offer one’s daughter in marriage to one, and not to sacrifice one’s daughter to a child bridegroom, fit enough to be rocked in a cradle, I am confident the fruits will be sweet for India.
('16', 150, 2, 11, 360120) It is worth considering carefully in what way the country can avail itself of the services of hundreds of widows, young and old; if educated women will not think about this, who else should?
('16', 150, 2, 12, 360311) I have had an idea for many years; I may as well mention it here.
('16', 150, 2, 13, 360377) Only a few years ago, our women used to spin cotton, and even weave.
('16', 150, 2, 14, 360446) Today, the art is about to disappear.
('16', 150, 2, 15, 360484) India has had to suffer much because of its decline.
('16', 150, 2, 16, 360537) Millions of rupees have been lost to foreign countries.
('16', 150, 2, 17, 360593) At present, widows spend their time going to temples or in the service of those claiming to be holy men, or in idle gossip.
('16', 150, 2, 18, 360717) It does not seem to me that one can live a religious life only by going to a temple, though, of course, I do not wish to suggest that thoughtful visits to a temple may not be profitable.
('16', 150, 2, 19, 360904) The idea, however, that spending time in a temple, unmindful of other tasks, is the furthest limit of selflessness is sheer superstition.
('16', 150, 2, 20, 361042) Likewise, to wait on men of holy life, who stand in no need of services from others, and to serve them in all manner of ways, is unwholesome for both parties and waste of one’s time.
('16', 150, 2, 21, 361225) To draw widows away from such activities and induce them to take up the task of serving India, work which will promote their ultimate good, is to help them to remarriage of the purest kind.
('16', 150, 2, 22, 361415) Why do not the educated women embark upon this mission?
('16', 150, 2, 23, 361471) Those of them who might think of doing so should themselves take the first lesson in the school of industry, namely, spin cotton and weave.

('16', 151, 3, 4, 361773) DEAR MR. MERRIMAN 1,
('16', 151, 4, 5, 361794) I think that I ought to keep you informed of my doings.
('16', 151, 4, 6, 361850) Having received an offer of a ready made school building and an invitation to open a school in a Kham village, I opened one today in Barharva Lakhamsen near Daka.
('16', 151, 4, 7, 362013) I have put there the best volunteer teachers from among those who have offered their assistance.
('16', 151, 4, 8, 362110) They are Mr. and Mrs. Gokhalay from Bombay.
('16', 151, 4, 9, 362154) They have their independent means, and Mrs. Gokhalay was doing educational work in Bombay.
('16', 151, 4, 10, 362245) The nature of the work they will do I have already described to you.
('16', 151, 4, 11, 362314) I am hoping, with the assistance, if possible, of the heads of the respective concerns to open similar schools, one in the Peeprah Dehat 2
('16', 151, 5, 12, 362453) and another in the Tarkaulia Dehat, and I hope to open one in the Belwa Dehat, As this attempt is in the nature of an experiment, I do not want to open more than four or five schools, until some definite result is obtained.
('16', 151, 5, 13, 362677) I hope that I shall have the co operation of the local officials in an experiment which, I know, is full of difficulty, but which is fraught with important consequences if it becomes successful.
('16', 151, 7, 14, 362872) Yours truly.

('16', 151, 9, 18, 363163) I am interested to hear of your attempt to found schools.
('16', 151, 9, 19, 363221) I shall be glad to hear more about this, regarding the class of schools you propose to open, and the type of education to be imparted.
('16', 151, 9, 20, 363356) Also the places where you open them.” For Gandhiji’s reply to this, vide “Letter to J. L. Merriman”, 19 11 1917.

('16', 152, 3, 4, 363581) MAGANLAL, I returned to Bettiah today and read your letters.
('16', 152, 3, 5, 363642) This letter will be posted on the first 1. Read the reply 2 to Thakorelal and send it on to his address.
('16', 152, 3, 6, 363747) It is enough if Nanubhai has been satisfied.
('16', 152, 3, 7, 363792) We shall progress even through the mistakes we make.
('16', 152, 3, 8, 363845) It will be much if we don’t make the same mistake again.
('16', 152, 3, 9, 363902) You may go out for as long as you wish.
('16', 152, 3, 10, 363942) You would do well to pay a visit to Umreth as well.
('16', 152, 3, 11, 363994) I take it that Chhaganlal is at Ahmedabad.
('16', 152, 3, 12, 364037) I suppose none of you have any occasion to go to the town.
('16', 152, 3, 13, 364096) Convey my humblest greetings to respected Khushalbhai 3 and Devabhabhi 4. My blessings to you all for the New Year.

('16', 153, 2, 3, 365064) MOTIHARI, New Year’s Day, 1974 [November 15, 1917] 1
('16', 153, 3, 4, 365117) What shall I give you on this auspicious day?
('16', 153, 3, 5, 365163) I am trying to give you what you, I and many others lack.
('16', 153, 3, 6, 365221) If one has that, one has everything.
('16', 153, 3, 7, 365258) Only he who has it can give it.
('16', 153, 3, 8, 365290) If that is the truth, what can I give?
('16', 153, 3, 9, 365329) However, we may strive for it together.
('16', 153, 4, 10, 365369) Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
('16', 153, 5, 11, 365498) And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
('16', 153, 6, 12, 365686) And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
('16', 153, 6, 13, 365824) Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not, charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
('16', 153, 7, 14, 366162) Charity never faileth; but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.
('16', 153, 8, 15, 366329) For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
('16', 153, 8, 16, 366375) But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
('16', 153, 8, 17, 366462) When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
('16', 153, 8, 18, 366627) For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
('16', 153, 9, 19, 366757) And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.
('16', 153, 10, 20, 366846) 1 On this date Gandhiji appears to have communicated with J. T. Whitty, Manager of Bettiah Raj and, later, had an interview with him.
('16', 153, 10, 21, 366980) Neither the correspondence nor an authorized report of the interview is available; but the gist of both along with Whitty’s personal assessment of Gandhiji are available in a letter of his, dated November 17, 1917, addressed to L. F. Morshead, Commissioner of the Tirhut Division, vide Appendix “Extract from J.T. Whitty’s Letter to L.F.

('16', 154, 1, 2, 367511) Read this, meditate on it and read it again.
('16', 154, 1, 3, 367556) Read it in English and translate it into Hindi.
('16', 154, 1, 4, 367604) Strain every nerve to have at least a brief glimpse of love.
('16', 154, 1, 5, 367665) Mira 1 had felt the stab of this dagger of love, deep in her heart.
('16', 154, 1, 6, 367733) If we could but get hold of this dagger and get also the strength to stab ourselves with it, we could shake the world.
('16', 154, 1, 7, 367852) The thing is there in me, and yet I feel its lack every moment.
('16', 154, 1, 8, 367916) There is much that is wanting.
('16', 154, 1, 9, 367947) Sometimes, I behave like a half filled pot.
('16', 154, 1, 10, 367991) Only yesterday, I had no time to spare for people who wanted, in their love, to detain me.
('16', 154, 1, 11, 368082) I felt sore over this all the time.
('16', 154, 1, 12, 368118) This is no sign of love.
('16', 154, 1, 13, 368143) That is just the way a half filled pot spills over.
('16', 154, 1, 14, 368195) May the New Year bring you prosperity.
('16', 154, 1, 15, 368234) It is my wish, and my only blessing, that you may grow in your physical, mental and spiritual powers and dedicate them all, with love, to India.

('16', 154, 6, 20, 368501) DEAR MR. MERRIMAN, I visited Koeri yesterday and met Shivratan 2 and other people.
('16', 154, 6, 21, 368584) As, however, the result of the inquiry ordered by you is, I understand, to be announced to Shivratan on the 23rd instant, I postpone submitting my observations till the result is known.
('16', 154, 6, 22, 368770) Raiyats 3 from the Siraha Dehat inform me that thumb marks are being taken on some contracts by that factory.
('16', 154, 6, 23, 368880) I am unable to advise them as to the action they should take until I see the draft.
('16', 154, 6, 24, 368964) I have, therefore, told them that if they wish to follow my advice they ought not to sign any document until I have seen it, as I consider myself entirely unfit to give advice otherwise.

('16', 155, 1, 3, 369483) I would like to add that it would tend to smoothness of relations between the landlords and the raiyats if the former showed you the contracts they wish to enter into with the raiyats.
('16', 155, 1, 4, 369668) As you may be aware, it has been a frequent complaint on the part of the raiyats that they are often made or called upon to sign documents which they do not understand.

('16', 155, 7, 10, 370052) RESPECTED BHAISHRI,
('16', 155, 8, 11, 370072) Your letter brought the same calm to my mind that one from Kalabhai 2 would have done.
('16', 155, 8, 12, 370159) I am all love and admiration for the Patwari family.
('16', 155, 8, 13, 370212) I can never forget the help 3 you gave me at a critical moment.
('16', 155, 8, 14, 370276) I have looked upon you as an elder brother.
('16', 155, 8, 15, 370320) No one can say what way I would have gone if you had not helped me in Bombay.
('16', 155, 9, 16, 370398) I can make only one return: I can so live as to make you think that the help given to me was well deserved.
('16', 155, 9, 17, 370506) I have a feeling that you are saddened after I have taken up my work for Bhangis.
('16', 155, 9, 18, 370588) I could not, and I cannot, give up my work for Bhangis.
('16', 155, 9, 19, 370644) But your being unhappy makes me sad and so, when I received your letter, I knew that, though you disapprove of my work for Bhangis, on the whole you don’t disapprove of all my activities.
('16', 155, 9, 20, 370832) This came to me as a blessin.
('16', 155, 9, 21, 370862) But I hope for more.

('16', 156, 1, 2, 371549) dharma is being destroyed; in the name of cow protection, destruction of cows is brought about; in the name of religion, the most irreligious practices are prevalent; posing to be men of religion, irreligious people lay down the law on religious matters.
('16', 156, 1, 3, 371804) If I can see these things, how is it that you, who cherish Vaishnava dharma, should not see them?
('16', 156, 1, 4, 371902) I find myself constantly asking this question.
('16', 156, 1, 5, 371949) Contact with a Bhangi can never be sinful; killing a Muslim for [saving] cows can never be a righteous act; the holy books can never have enjoined untruth; men who give free rein to their desires ought not to rule in matters of religion; all this is axiomatic.
('16', 156, 1, 6, 372210) How can there be any difference of opinion about this?
('16', 156, 1, 7, 372265) Would you not like to use the influence you have acquired over the Vaishnava community towards this end?
('16', 156, 1, 8, 372370) Can you not help men like me at least with your verbal support?
('16', 156, 1, 9, 372434) What tapascharya can I go through to make you see things as I see them?
('16', 156, 1, 10, 372506) I keep asking these questions.
('16', 156, 1, 11, 372537) Please think [of them] inwardly again.
('16', 156, 2, 12, 372576) I send you [reports of] my speeches 1 and should like you to read them again from this point of view.
('16', 156, 3, 13, 372678) Though I may not be able just now to read the books you mention, please send them to me.

('16', 157, 1, 2, 373135) 62. LETTER TO J.L. MERRIMAN
('16', 157, 2, 3, 373163) MOTIHARI,
('16', 157, 3, 4, 373173) November 19, 1917
('16', 157, 4, 5, 373191) DEAR MR. MERRIMAN,
('16', 157, 5, 6, 373210) In the schools I am opening, children under the age of 12 only are admitted.
('16', 157, 5, 7, 373287) The idea is to get hold of as many children as possible and to give them an all round education, i.e., a knowledge of Hindi or Urdu and, through that medium, of Arithmetic, rudim ents of History and Geography, a knowledge of simple scientific principles and some industrial training.
('16', 157, 5, 8, 373571) No cut and dried syllabus has been yet prepared, because I am going along an unbeaten track.
('16', 157, 5, 9, 373664) I look upon our own present system with horror and distrust.
('16', 157, 5, 10, 373725) Instead of developing the moral and the mental faculties of the little children, it dwarfs them.
('16', 157, 5, 11, 373822) In my experiment, whilst I shall draw upon what is good in it, I shall endeavour to avoid the defects of the present system.
('16', 157, 5, 12, 373947) The chief thing aimed at is contact of the children with men and women of culture and unimpeachable moral character.
('16', 157, 5, 13, 374064) That to me is education.
('16', 157, 5, 14, 374089) Literary training is to be used merely as a means to that end.
('16', 157, 5, 15, 374152) The industrial training is designed to give the boys and girls who may come to us, an additional means of livelihood.
('16', 157, 5, 16, 374270) It is not intended that on completing their education, they should leave their hereditary occupation, viz., agriculture, but make use of the knowledge gained in the school to refine agriculture and agricultural life.
('16', 157, 5, 17, 374487) Our teachers will also touch the lives of the grown up people and, if at all possible, penetrate the purdah.
('16', 157, 5, 18, 374596) Instructions will, therefore, be given to grown up people in hygiene and about the advantages of joint action for the promotion of communal welfare, such as the making of village roads proper, the sinking of wells, etc.
('16', 157, 5, 19, 374816) And as no school will be manned by teachers who are not men or women of good training, we propose to give free medical aid, so far as is possible.
('16', 157, 5, 20, 374963) In Badharwa for instance, Mrs. Avantikabai Gokhalay who is a trained nurse and midwife and who, assisted by her husband, is in charge of the school, has already dispensed castor oil and quinine to scores of patients during the four days that she has been at work and visited several female patients.
('16', 157, 6, 21, 375263) If you desire any further information, I shall be only too glad to supply you with it.
('16', 157, 6, 22, 375350) My hope is that I shall be able to enlist in my work full co operation of the local authority.
('16', 157, 6, 23, 375445) I am opening another school
('16', 158, 0, 1, 375473) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 159
('16', 158, 1, 2, 375519) tomorrow near Shrirampur, about two miles from Amolwa.
('16', 158, 1, 3, 375574) Regarding the raiyats, complaints about documents, evidently the point I wished to make was not made by me.
('16', 158, 1, 4, 375682) I know that the raiyats can go to court about compulsion.
('16', 158, 1, 5, 375740) The difficulty is that they are neither trained nor organized enough for orderly work.
('16', 158, 1, 6, 375827) What is morally compulsion may not be compulsion in law.
('16', 158, 1, 7, 375884) My experience of the Champaran raiyat is that he is extremely unintelligent and is easily made to assent mentally to any proposition.
('16', 158, 1, 8, 376018) I hold, therefore, that the Government, as the guardian of such people, have to save them from their own ignorance.
('16', 158, 1, 9, 376134) I do not say that in the Saraiya case brought to your notice, any compulsion has been used.
('16', 158, 1, 10, 376226) I simply suggested that, in order that there might be no allegation of compulsion after such documents as I have referred to in my previous letter are signed, you might, if you deemed it proper, inquire about the contracts now offered to the raiyats for their signatures.
('16', 158, 3, 11, 376498) Yours truly, M. K. GANDHI

('16', 159, 2, 3, 377408) MOTIHARI, November 22, 1917 DEAR MR. MERRIMAN, I went over to Bhitiharva on Tuesday last and opened a school there.
('16', 159, 2, 4, 377524) Mr. Soman, a public worker from Belgaum, and a B.A. LL.B., has been left in charge, and he will be assisted by Mr. Balkrishna, a young man from Gujarat.
('16', 159, 2, 5, 377677) Mrs. Gandhi will join them on the 24th.
('16', 159, 2, 6, 377717) Her work will be chiefly confined to moving among the women.
('16', 159, 2, 7, 377778) I was in Badharwa yesterday, and Mrs. Gokhalay and my son were just returning from a visit to a dying man.
('16', 159, 2, 8, 377885) They told me that the people in the District were woefully neglectful of the patients, and they believed that many preventible deaths must occur in the District for want of a simple observance of the rudimentary principles of hygiene.
('16', 159, 2, 9, 378120) I know that this will not come to you as news, because it is not a peculiar condition of the District in which Mrs. Gokhalay is working, or of Champaran, but it is a chronic condition among the peasantry of India.
('16', 159, 2, 10, 378334) I simply mentioned the incidents in order that, as soon as I have advanced a little more in my experiment, I may enlist your active sympathy and help in a Department in which all can meet without reserve.
('16', 159, 2, 11, 378539) Dr. Dev 1, who is a qualified and experienced surgeon and physician, and Secretary of the Servants of India Society came on Tuesday.
('16', 159, 2, 12, 378672) His services have been lent for this work by the Society.
('16', 159, 2, 13, 378730) He has come with three more volunteers including a lady from Prof.
('16', 159, 2, 14, 378797) Karwe’s Widows’ Home.
('16', 159, 2, 15, 378819) Dr. Dev will chiefly supervise the Medical Branch of the work.
('16', 159, 2, 16, 378882) I may state that I shall be away from Champaran for over a fortnight.
('16', 159, 2, 17, 378952) Babu Brijkishore Prasad will represent me in my absence.

('16', 160, 2, 3, 379574) MOTIHARI, Kartak Sud 8 [November 22, 1917]
('16', 160, 3, 4, 379617) BHAISHRI CHANDULAL,
('16', 160, 4, 5, 379637) I have your letter.
('16', 160, 4, 6, 379657) You have been keeping your vows well enough and they are good ones to take.
('16', 160, 4, 7, 379733) It is my conviction that one cannot build one’s character without the help of vows.
('16', 160, 4, 8, 379817) They are to a man what anchor is to a ship.
('16', 160, 4, 9, 379861) A ship without an anchor is tossed to and fro and finally broken on the rocks; without vows, human beings meet a similar fate.
('16', 160, 4, 10, 379988) The vow of truth includes all others.
('16', 160, 4, 11, 380026) How would a man who respects truth violate brahmacharya or steal anything?
('16', 160, 4, 12, 380101) “ Brahma alone is real; all else is non existent.” If this sutra 1 is true, knowledge of Brahma is implied in the observance of truth.
('16', 160, 5, 13, 380236) Non violence and truth are convertible terms.
('16', 160, 5, 14, 380282) This seems to be the idea behind the saying, “One must speak truth, truth that is agreeable.” 2 That is genuine truth which causes no pain, for that alone is non violent.
('16', 160, 5, 15, 380453) Truth may sound harsh but it can never result in suffering.
('16', 160, 5, 16, 380513) Our employment of truth may offend the other person, but his conscience will tell him that what was said about him was true and was said with the best of motives.
('16', 160, 5, 17, 380676) We are here interpreting truth in its widest connotation.
('16', 160, 5, 18, 380734) Truth does not mean merely being truthful in speech; the term “truth” means exactly the same thing as it does in the sutra about Brahma alone being true.
('16', 160, 5, 19, 380888) The English word “truth” also carries the same meaning.
('16', 160, 5, 20, 380944) I remember to have told you that you are not made to work for women’s education.
('16', 160, 5, 21, 381025) I may be wrong, but I think it is quite a difficult task and I have not felt that you have the strength required for it.
('16', 160, 5, 22, 381146) From my experience of you, I do not think that you can take up the work by yourself.
('16', 160, 5, 23, 381231) All the same, if you are so much in love with it, by all means go on with it.
('16', 160, 5, 24, 381309) I think Sharadabehn also will not be able to manage without you now.
('16', 160, 5, 25, 381378) It may be just as well, therefore, if you do not give up that work.
('16', 160, 6, 26, 381446) 1 An aphorism 2 An old Sanskrit saying runs: | :

('16', 161, 1, 2, 381537) I have not noticed much physical energy in you.
('16', 161, 1, 3, 381585) You need to spend, in the Ashram or elsewhere, two or three months in purely physical work, as much of it as your body can stand—from cleaning food grains to digging pits.
('16', 161, 1, 4, 381757) This will give you fresh mental energy.
('16', 161, 1, 5, 381797) Your slowness in work will disappear.
('16', 161, 1, 6, 381835) The eyes, hands, legs, etc., need to be exercised.
('16', 161, 1, 7, 381886) I have noticed that you lack energy.
('16', 161, 2, 8, 381923) I have read Nandlal Kisan’s letter.
('16', 161, 2, 9, 381959) We shall have a talk about what we can do in the Indian States.
('16', 161, 2, 10, 382023) You will meet me in Bombay, or in Ahmedabad at any rate, in December.
('16', 161, 3, 11, 382093) If you have faith in yourself, you will be able to do much in your family circle.
('16', 161, 3, 12, 382175) It is for the son to bring round the mother.
('16', 161, 3, 13, 382220) A mother loves her son so much that she even submits to his wishes.
('16', 161, 3, 14, 382288) It will be a crime for you not to spare enough time for your daughters.

('16', 161, 9, 20, 382521) MY DEAR MILLIE,
('16', 161, 10, 21, 382537) I am just off to Delhi.
('16', 161, 10, 22, 382561) As I shall be on the move again for a fortnight.
('16', 161, 10, 23, 382610) I must send you a line before beginning it.
('16', 161, 10, 24, 382654) I am glad you are making steady progress and have found a friend in Miss Petit.
('16', 161, 10, 25, 382734) Mrs. Gokhale 1 is already in charge of a school.
('16', 161, 10, 26, 382783) 2 Devdas is with them.
('16', 161, 10, 27, 382806) He is growing a big boy.
('16', 161, 10, 28, 382831) Mrs. Gandhi is in her element.
('16', 161, 10, 29, 382862) She is going to assist at another school.
('16', 161, 10, 30, 382904) This means life in the jungle.
('16', 161, 10, 31, 382935) She does not mind it.
('16', 161, 10, 32, 382957) Dr. Deva has come with 3 more volunteers.
('16', 161, 10, 33, 382999) So we have enough for the time being.
('16', 161, 10, 34, 383037) Do please write to Miss Faering.

('16', 162, 1, 6, 383427) This is not for you to worry over.
('16', 162, 1, 7, 383462) I am seeking information if you know anything about Henry’s dispositions.

('16', 163, 3, 4, 384198) He gave his hearers to understand that the plea of benefit to the community would be of no avail to procure Home Rule unless unity prevailed among them.
('16', 163, 3, 5, 384351) In referring to the Arrah riots, he expressed contempt of the contemptible and detestable barbarism exhibited by the Hindus.
('16', 163, 3, 6, 384476) It was for the Hindus to mend the gap.
('16', 163, 3, 7, 384515) Hindu Mohammedan quarrels should be settled like those of [a] private family.
('16', 163, 3, 8, 384593) He made many references to the Ali brothers .

('16', 163, 7, 13, 384802) He had seen Aligarh working for the nation and the country, but the Mohammedans were not so absorbed in endeavouring to uplift their country as their brothers—the Hindus were.
('16', 163, 7, 14, 384978) He would like to see some, if not all, of the College students nation uplifters, such as Mr. Gokhale was.
('16', 163, 7, 15, 385084) He made a reference to his dress (white kurta, dhoti and topi) and said that it was the only suitable dress for Indians; the depressed class would listen to and consult persons dressed in the garb of ancient India more readily than they would those dressed in modern clothes....

('16', 163, 9, 18, 385596) One of the students garlanded Gandiji in the name of Home Rule.
('16', 163, 9, 19, 385660) The Leader, 1 12 1917, reported that, in his speech, Gandhiji “referred to Sir Syed Ahmed’s saying that Hindus and Mahomedans were like the two eyes of the motherland.” 2 After his address at the library grounds, vide the preceding item, Gandhiji spoke to the students on “Truth and Thrift” with the permission of Reynell, acting Principal of the College.
('16', 163, 9, 20, 386016) Later, he went to Khwaja Abdul Majid’s house and from there to the station and left for Calcutta.

('16', 164, 2, 3, 386204) [Before November 30, 1917]
('16', 164, 3, 4, 386231) Both of them have an excessively heavy burden on them.
('16', 164, 3, 5, 386286) There may be one difference between you and me.
('16', 164, 3, 6, 386334) Whatever little happiness I get is from the practice of self control.
('16', 164, 3, 7, 386404) Without the discipline of self control, I just cannot live.
('16', 164, 3, 8, 386464) Whenever I lose it, I feel pained.
('16', 164, 3, 9, 386499) When I lose temper with Ba, I give myself condign punishment for doing so.
('16', 164, 3, 10, 386574) At Godhra, I replied rather rudely to one of the delegates.
('16', 164, 3, 11, 386634) I was satisfied only when I had apologized to him in public.
('16', 164, 3, 12, 386695) I shall have to be in Calcutta on the 30th of November and so, most probably, I shall be in Ahmedabad quite early.
('16', 164, 3, 13, 386810) 2 However, I shall get only two days there.
('16', 164, 3, 14, 386854) Perhaps, I may not be able to go to Ahmedabad after all.
('16', 164, 3, 15, 386911) I shall spare no effort, though.

('16', 164, 7, 19, 387098) NADIAD, December 6, 1917
('16', 164, 8, 20, 387123) HOW TO PREVENT 1T ?
('16', 164, 8, 21, 387143) 1. If one’s blood is pure, it has the power of destroying the germs of every type of disease.
('16', 164, 9, 22, 387237) 2. If, therefore, we maintain our body in a healthy state, thanks to the pure blood, it will remain well protected even in an epidemic of contagious disease.
('16', 164, 10, 23, 387395) 3. For maintaining purity of blood, one must eat simple food, in limited quantity and at fixed hours.
('16', 164, 10, 24, 387497) Any diet containing excessive fat or sugar, or cooked with spices, must be avoided.
('16', 164, 10, 25, 387581) One must eat nothing for at least three hours before bed time.
('16', 164, 10, 26, 387644) Air too is food.
('16', 164, 11, 27, 387661) 1 The first three pages of the letter are not available.
('16', 164, 11, 28, 387718) 2 Gandhiji was in Ahmedabad on December 4 and 5.
('16', 165, 0, 1, 387767) 166 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 165, 1, 2, 387809) should not, therefore, sleep except in a house with proper windows and doors, and these should be kept open.
('16', 165, 1, 3, 387918) Nor should one sleep with one’s face entirely covered with the sheet.
('16', 165, 1, 4, 387988) If the head feels cold, one may wear a cap, but the face should always be left uncovered.
('16', 165, 1, 5, 388078) If the mouth is kept closed and air inhaled only through the nostrils, there is no risk of one’s feeling cold.
('16', 165, 1, 6, 388189) Water, too, must be clean.
('16', 165, 1, 7, 388216) It is an excellent practice always to drink water that has been boiled and strained through thick cloth.
('16', 165, 1, 8, 388321) The latter should be carefully washed every day.
('16', 165, 1, 9, 388370) And so, also, the inside of the water pot should be properly cleaned every day.
('16', 165, 1, 10, 388450) Every man or woman should have as much exercise daily as may be got by walking for two hours.
('16', 165, 2, 11, 388544) 4. Even a person who does all this and keeps healthy may have his blood affected if the home and its surroundings are not clean.
('16', 165, 2, 12, 388673) The doors and windows, the ceiling, the floor, the staircase—in short, every part of the house—should be kept perfectly clean.
('16', 165, 2, 13, 388800) For this purpose, such part of the house as can be washed should be washed properly and then allowed to dry.
('16', 165, 2, 14, 388909) Cobwebs, dust, straw and rubbish of every description should every day be carefully swept out of the house.
('16', 165, 2, 15, 389017) It should be ensured that no part of the house remains wet.
('16', 165, 2, 16, 389077) Carpets and floor coverings should be daily taken up [for dusting] and not left in their place day after day.
('16', 165, 2, 17, 389187) Doctors say that the plague spreads through fleas.
('16', 165, 2, 18, 389238) In a well swept house with plenty of air and light, fleas will hardly ever enter.
('16', 165, 2, 19, 389320) They say, too, that the disease spreads through rats.
('16', 165, 2, 20, 389374) One should, therefore, examine all the corners of the floor and the entire plastering and see that there are no holes anywhere.
('16', 165, 2, 21, 389502) This can be done easily enough, and at no expense.
('16', 165, 2, 22, 389553) It is because of our laziness that rats make their holes in our houses.
('16', 165, 2, 23, 389625) Keeping a cat in the house will prevent it from being so infested.
('16', 165, 3, 24, 389692) 5. But the most important cause of illness in India is the defective and extremely harmful methods we follow for answering calls of nature.
('16', 165, 3, 25, 389832) A large number of people do this in the open.
('16', 165, 3, 26, 389878) The excreta are not covered over with earth or otherwise, and this leads to the breeding of millions of flies every day.
('16', 165, 3, 27, 389999) They come into contact, first, with excreta and then with our body, food and clothes.
('16', 165, 3, 28, 390085) Several kinds of poisonous gases are generated by the excreta all the time and these pollute the air all round.
('16', 165, 3, 29, 390197) It is obvious that when air, which is men’s best food, is being thus continually polluted, they cannot maintain good health.
('16', 165, 3, 30, 390322) The filth in our latrines is equally or even more harmful.
('16', 165, 3, 31, 390381) For it is in our very homes.
('16', 165, 3, 32, 390410) If, therefore, we go out into the open, after
('16', 166, 0, 1, 390456) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 167
('16', 166, 1, 2, 390502) defecating we must cover the excreta with earth as people in other countries do.
('16', 166, 1, 3, 390583) Latrines should have arrangements for dry dust to be sprinkled in sufficient quantity every time after use.
('16', 166, 1, 4, 390691) The excreta should be collected in some sort of a bucket.
('16', 166, 1, 5, 390749) The refuse pit should be avoided altogether and all conduits should be closed up.
('16', 166, 1, 6, 390831) Urine and water should also be collected in the bucket.
('16', 166, 1, 7, 390887) If we did not cherish false notions in the name of religion, we would never tolerate such hellish filth.
('16', 166, 1, 8, 390992) The latrine should be so constructed as to permit the scavenger access to every part of it.
('16', 166, 1, 9, 391084) Unless these improvements are carried out, cities in India will never be free from infectious diseases.
('16', 166, 2, 10, 391188) 6. The air gets polluted also by reason of people urinating or spitting or throwing litter and other rubbish anywhere on the roads.
('16', 166, 2, 11, 391320) Doctors have discovered that germs spread even from the spittle of certain categories of patients, of tuberculous patients for instance, and infect others.
('16', 166, 2, 12, 391476) We must certainly consider what we do and where.
('16', 166, 2, 13, 391525) Millions of people in this country walk bare foot.
('16', 166, 2, 14, 391576) It is a sorry state of affairs that they have to walk on filth.
('16', 166, 2, 15, 391640) Our roads, our streets or the verandahs of our houses should be so clean that one would not hesitate to sit down or even sleep on them,
('16', 166, 3, 16, 391776) We would do well to do some careful thinking why it is that, in cities with an English population, the English localities are unaffected even when an epidemic of the plague is raging.
('16', 166, 3, 17, 391960) The reason is nothing else than the cleanliness of the place.
('16', 166, 3, 18, 392022) Maintaining cleanliness requires no money but merely intelligent care.
('16', 166, 4, 19, 392093) TREATMENT
('16', 166, 5, 20, 392103) 7. The plague will never spread to cities where these rules are carefully observed.
('16', 166, 5, 21, 392187) Let us now consider what should be done when it has actually broken out.
('16', 166, 5, 22, 392260) Whenever a case of plague is detected, one must search out rats and, if one finds any dead ones, they must be removed with a pair of tongs to a distant place and burnt with the help of hay or kerosene or buried in a deep pit far away from human habitation.
('16', 166, 5, 23, 392517) The place where a dead rat is found should be covered with live ashes and whitewashed, the room emptied of everything, swept clean and fumigated with neem leaves.
('16', 166, 5, 24, 392680) If the walls permit of being whitewashed, they should be.
('16', 166, 5, 25, 392738) If there are any rat holes, they should be opened up to make sure that there are no dead rats inside and then filled in.
('16', 166, 5, 26, 392859) Any holes elsewhere in the house should be treated in the same manner.
('16', 166, 5, 27, 392930) The doors and windows should be kept open and
('16', 167, 0, 1, 392976) 168 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 167, 1, 2, 393018) plenty of light and heat let in; if the roofs are covered with country tiles, they should also be removed so as to let in air and light.
('16', 167, 1, 3, 393155) Having cleaned up the house in this manner, we should leave it empty and, if possible, live in tents or huts put up in the open.
('16', 167, 1, 4, 393284) We should avoid contact with other people in the town and even when shopping be careful not to touch the shopkeeper.
('16', 167, 1, 5, 393401) If in this way immediate remedial measures are taken, the plague will not spread further.
('16', 167, 1, 6, 393491) It will not affect other families in the same town or neighbouring towns through the families which have already been affected.
('16', 167, 1, 7, 393619) If, after 31 days outside, one finds that the infection has not spread elsewhere or that no dead rats are found in the unoccupied house, the family can return to it.
('16', 167, 2, 8, 393785) 8 In any town where a case of the plague has occurred, the other families should immediately inspect their own houses.
('16', 167, 2, 9, 393904) They should remove the household things outside and look for rats.
('16', 167, 2, 10, 393971) If they find any dead ones, they should leave the house and go to live outside as advised above.
('16', 167, 2, 11, 394068) Even if no dead rats are found, the house should be thoroughly swept and kept very clean afterwards.
('16', 167, 2, 12, 394169) It should be whitewashed.
('16', 167, 2, 13, 394195) If there are no arrangements for ventilation, the necessary structural improvements should be carried out.
('16', 167, 2, 14, 394302) Measures should also be adopted to maintain the utmost cleanliness in the surroundings.
('16', 167, 2, 15, 394390) If the neighbours’ houses are not clean, it should be seen to it that they are cleaned.
('16', 167, 3, 16, 394478) 9. Nothing should be done to put the patient into a fright.
('16', 167, 3, 17, 394538) No one except the person nursing him should be allowed to go near him.
('16', 167, 3, 18, 394609) He should be kept only in a room with plenty of air and light.
('16', 167, 3, 19, 394672) If there is a public hospital, he should be removed there.
('16', 167, 3, 20, 394731) All food should be discontinued.
('16', 167, 3, 21, 394764) If he has had no food for three hours at the time the symptoms of the plague are detected, he should be immediately given an enema.
('16', 167, 3, 22, 394896) He should be placed in a tub, filled with cold water, for two minutes or, if he prefers, for five minutes so that his legs and chest remain out of water, and the portion from the knees to the hips under water.
('16', 167, 3, 23, 395106) If he feels thirsty, he may be given as much as he needs of water that has been boiled, cooled, and filtered.
('16', 167, 3, 24, 395216) Apart from this, he should have nothing to eat, or even to drink.
('16', 167, 3, 25, 395282) If the head feels very hot, a mud poultice or a wet sheet pack should be applied to it.
('16', 167, 3, 26, 395370) Very likely, these measures will suffice to secure the patient against the risk of death.
('16', 167, 3, 27, 395460) If he survives the next day and if he feels hungry, he may be given lime juice or orange juice to drink, mixed with boiling water or cold water.
('16', 167, 3, 28, 395605) When the temperature has become quite normal, he may be started on
('16', 168, 0, 1, 395672) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 169
('16', 168, 1, 2, 395718) If there is a tumour, it should be treated with hot water poultice, which should be changed often.
('16', 168, 1, 3, 395817) A piece of thick cloth 1_ ft.
('16', 168, 1, 4, 395847) long and 9 in.
('16', 168, 1, 5, 395862) broad should be wetted with hot water and the water drained out, placing the cloth in a dry handkerchief.
('16', 168, 1, 6, 395968) The cloth should then be folded up into four layers and placed on the tumour, as hot as the patient can bear, and the tumour should be bandaged up.
('16', 168, 1, 7, 396116) The poultice should be changed after every 30 minutes.
('16', 168, 1, 8, 396171) In this disease, the patient’s heart grows very weak and he should, therefore, be given complete rest.
('16', 168, 2, 9, 396274) 10. The man attending on the patient should keep away from others and avoid any work which requires contacts with them.
('16', 168, 2, 10, 396394) To ensure his own safety, he should reduce his food to a minimum and otherwise be very careful of his health.
('16', 168, 2, 11, 396504) He should not worry at all.
('16', 168, 2, 12, 396532) If he feels constipated, he should take an enema to clear the intestines and live only on fruits.
('16', 168, 3, 13, 396630) 11. The patient’s clothes should not be washed in a river or at any other place where others’ clothes are washed.
('16', 168, 3, 14, 396744) They should be soaked in boiling soap water.
('16', 168, 3, 15, 396789) If they are very dirty, they should be burnt away.
('16', 168, 3, 16, 396840) The bedding, etc., should not be used by anyone else and, if clean enough, it should be dried in the sun daily for eight days, exposing both sides by turns to sunshine.
('16', 168, 3, 17, 397009) If one can afford it, one should have it burnt away.

('16', 168, 6, 20, 397131) MOTIHARI, December 10, 1917
('16', 168, 7, 21, 397159) MY DEAR WEST, I have your important letter before me.
('16', 168, 7, 22, 397213) My view is that if you can turn out Indian Opinion only by removing to Town 1, you should suspend publication.
('16', 168, 7, 23, 397324) I do not like the idea of your competing for jobs or advertisements.
('16', 168, 7, 24, 397393) I think that when that time comes we shall have outlived our purpose.
('16', 168, 7, 25, 397463) I would rather that you sold out Phoenix and
('16', 168, 8, 26, 397508) 1 Durban; the paper was being printed at Phoenix.
('16', 169, 0, 1, 397558) 170 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 169, 1, 2, 397600) you and Sam 1 were engaged in some other independent work.
('16', 169, 1, 3, 397659) If you can make of Phoenix something without the Paper, I shall like the idea.
('16', 169, 1, 4, 397738) But if you cannot even eke out a living from agriculture at Phoenix, Phoenix should be sold.
('16', 169, 1, 5, 397831) Hilda’s education can remain in your own hands.
('16', 169, 1, 6, 397879) Surely some drastic steps are necessary for a due fulfilment of one’s ideals.
('16', 169, 2, 7, 397957) If you cannot support yourself out of Phoenix with or without the Paper and cannot secure a decent job for yourself, I must find your maintenance from here.
('16', 169, 2, 8, 398114) You will then let me know how much you will require and for how long.
('16', 169, 2, 9, 398184) For I presume that you will try to secure work there.
('16', 169, 2, 10, 398238) I am quite willing to have Devi 2 here if she would come and even you if you could come alone for a time.
('16', 169, 2, 11, 398344) But I know that Mrs. Pywell 3 and perhaps Mrs. West too may not like the climate or the surroundings here.
('16', 169, 3, 12, 398451) If Manilal wants to try his hand at turning out a sheet himself at any cost, he may be allowed to do it.
('16', 169, 4, 13, 398556) This I know that the proposed attempt in Town must become a dismal failure.
('16', 169, 4, 14, 398632) We left it because we found it unworkable.
('16', 169, 4, 15, 398675) We have arrived at all the stages after careful deliberation and as they were found necessary.
('16', 169, 4, 16, 398770) Your methods cannot be those of ordinary business men.
('16', 169, 4, 17, 398825) You will soon tire.
('16', 169, 4, 18, 398845) Why try what is foredoomed to failure?
('16', 169, 4, 19, 398884) I would like to let Manilal have a hand if he will but try.
('16', 169, 4, 20, 398944) I am writing 4 to him.

('16', 170, 3, 4, 399588) DEAR MR. MERRIMAN, I returned from my tours early this morning, and found a letter lying for me.
('16', 170, 3, 5, 399685) I enclose copy of same 2 herewith.
('16', 170, 4, 6, 399720) Dr. Deva tells me that in Mitiharva and the surrounding villages, nearly 50 p.c.
('16', 170, 4, 7, 399801) of the population is suffering from a fever which often proves fatal.
('16', 170, 4, 8, 399871) Our workers are rendering all the assistance they can.

('16', 170, 10, 13, 400152) MY DEAR MILLIE, I arrived here this morning from my peregrinations and found your letter awaiting me.
('16', 170, 10, 14, 400254) I hope you will not worry about the money.
('16', 170, 10, 15, 400297) I shall trace the error somehow.
('16', 170, 10, 16, 400330) Anyway, I have told Revashankarbhai that he is to honour your drawings.
('16', 170, 10, 17, 400402) You need not therefore put off your visit to Calcutta if you can otherwise manage it.
('16', 170, 10, 18, 400488) I should like you not to feel hampered by the imaginary pecuniary difficulty.
('16', 170, 10, 19, 400566) I am sorry you can no longer take you walks.
('16', 170, 10, 20, 400611) They are such a tonic and a necessity.
('16', 170, 10, 21, 400650) I shall therefore hope to hear from you that you have been able to resume them.
('16', 170, 10, 22, 400730) Yes, I went to Delhi to see Mr. Montagu and had a good chat with him as also Mr. Roberts.
('16', 170, 10, 23, 400820) The Viceroy was also present.
('16', 170, 10, 24, 400850) All the three were nice.
('16', 170, 10, 25, 400875) There is no doubt that we shall gain something good.

('16', 171, 1, 3, 401299) It was a spiritual affair rather than a popular show.
('16', 171, 1, 4, 401353) I was glad to be able to go.
('16', 171, 2, 5, 401382) Thence I went to Ahmedabad and Bombay and attended imp ortant meetings.
('16', 171, 2, 6, 401454) But the journeying was trying.
('16', 171, 2, 7, 401485) The trains were always crowded.
('16', 171, 2, 8, 401517) Night and day travelling under such conditions must tell.
('16', 171, 3, 9, 401575) Devdas and Mrs. G. I have not yet met.
('16', 171, 3, 10, 401614) They are in their respective schools ≈ fancy Mrs. G. being placed in charge of a school.
('16', 171, 3, 11, 401703) 1 It is a bold innovation.

('16', 171, 9, 19, 401921) MY DEAR SAM,
('16', 171, 10, 20, 401934) Mr. West has asked me whether it may not be advisable to shift to Town.
('16', 171, 10, 21, 402006) My answer is in the negative.
('16', 171, 10, 22, 402036) I would feel deeply hurt if you cannot keep up Indian Opinion in Phoenix.
('16', 171, 10, 23, 402110) In any case you should not remove the works.
('16', 171, 10, 24, 402155) If you cannot turn out the Paper in Phoenix, it must be stopped.
('16', 171, 10, 25, 402220) You should then try to get a living from agriculture alone devoting the whole of your time to it.
('16', 171, 10, 26, 402318) If that too fails, you should earn your living in Town.
('16', 171, 10, 27, 402374) I have suggested to Manilal that he should, with the assistance of Ram 2, Devi Behn and Nagarji alone, turn out the Gujarati part only.
('16', 171, 10, 28, 402510) If Ram and even Nagarji cannot be supported they too should go.
('16', 171, 10, 29, 402574) I do not care even if two sheets only are turned out in Gujarati every week.
('16', 171, 10, 30, 402651) You are on your trial.
('16', 171, 10, 31, 402674) Please do not fail.

('16', 172, 5, 6, 403088) MOTIHARI,
('16', 172, 6, 7, 403098) CHAMPARAN, December 12, 1917
('16', 172, 7, 8, 403127) DEAR ESTHER,
('16', 172, 8, 9, 403140) Your letter just received grieves me.
('16', 172, 8, 10, 403178) “Be careful for nothing” comes to my lips as I write these lines.
('16', 172, 8, 11, 403244) Why fret and worry?
('16', 172, 8, 12, 403264) You are just now passing through fire.
('16', 172, 8, 13, 403303) 2 I am sure you will come out unhurt.
('16', 172, 8, 14, 403341) It is your clear duty just now to obey those to whom you have given the right to control your movements.
('16', 172, 8, 15, 403446) You can oppose them only when they clearly hinder your spiritual progress.
('16', 172, 8, 16, 403521) They receive the benefit of any doubt.
('16', 172, 8, 17, 403560) You could certainly reason with them that just at this time of the year you will have perfect weather in Ahmedabad, loving attention and no worry.
('16', 172, 8, 18, 403707) The very change of surroundings is likely to do you good.
('16', 172, 8, 19, 403765) If you still fail, you have to accept their opposition with resignation.

('16', 172, 10, 28, 404278) Entrusted with educational work, she visited Sabarmati Ashram in 1917 and was much drawn to it.
('16', 172, 10, 29, 404374) Her Mission did not approve of her contacts and correspondence with Gandhiji, to whom she became attached as a daughter.
('16', 172, 10, 30, 404495) Later, in 1919, she resigned and became an inmate of the Ashram for some time.

('16', 174, 3, 4, 405894) DEAR MR. HAMMOND 1, I have just received your note of the 13th instant.
('16', 174, 3, 5, 405966) 2 Having, after the conversation with you, concluded that my services will not be wanted, I have accepted important engagements up to the end of March next, and have just now entered upon an educational and hygienic experiment 3 to which I attach the greatest importance and which requires my constant attention.
('16', 174, 3, 6, 406279) I should not like to leave this work and yet I do not want to lose any chance of taking what little share I can in the present War.
('16', 174, 3, 7, 406411) I may find it practically impossible to raise a corps on which I might not be serving.
('16', 174, 3, 8, 406498) I would also find it difficult to get men if I could not assure them that they would all work in a body and with me.
('16', 174, 3, 9, 406615) Will you please tell me in detail what your different requirements are and when you will want the corps and I shall see whether I can fit in.
('16', 174, 3, 10, 406757) You will please tell me in each case the nature of work required and, if possible, the destination of the proposed corps.

('16', 175, 2, 3, 407480) MOTIHARI, December 15, 1917
('16', 175, 3, 4, 407508) When I left South Africa, I had fully intended to write to my Indian and English friends there from time to time, but I found my lot in India to be quite different from what I had expected it to be.
('16', 175, 3, 5, 407707) I had hoped to be able to have comparative peace and leisure but I have been irresistibly drawn into many activities.
('16', 175, 3, 6, 407825) I hardly cope with them and local daily correspondence.
('16', 175, 3, 7, 407881) Half of my time is passed in the Indian trains.
('16', 175, 3, 8, 407929) My South African friends will, I hope, forgive me for my apparent neglect of them.
('16', 175, 3, 9, 408012) Let me assure them that not a day has passed when I have not thought of them and their kindness.
('16', 175, 3, 10, 408109) South African associations can never be effaced from my memory.
('16', 175, 3, 11, 408173) You will not now be surprised when I tell you that it was only today that I learnt from Indian Opinion to hand, about the disastrous floods.
('16', 175, 3, 12, 408314) During my travels I rarely read newspapers and I have time merely to glance at them whilst I am not travelling.
('16', 175, 3, 13, 408426) I write this to tender my sympathy to the sufferers.
('16', 175, 3, 14, 408479) My imagination enables me to draw a true picture of their sufferings.
('16', 175, 3, 15, 408549) They make one think of God and His might and the utter evanescence of this life.
('16', 175, 3, 16, 408630) They ought to teach us ever to seek His protection and never to fail in the daily duty before us.
('16', 175, 3, 17, 408728) In the divine account books only our actions are noted, not what we have spoken.
('16', 175, 3, 18, 408809) These and similar reflections fill my soul for the moment and I wish to share them with the sufferers.
('16', 175, 3, 19, 408912) The deep poverty that I experience in this country deters me even from thinking of financial assistance to be sent for those who have been rendered homeless.
('16', 175, 3, 20, 409070) Even one pie in this country counts.
('16', 175, 3, 21, 409107) I am, at this very moment, living in the midst of thousands who have nothing but roasted pulse or grain flour mixed with water and salt.
('16', 175, 3, 22, 409244) We, therefore, can only send the sufferers an assurance of our heartfelt grief.
('16', 175, 3, 23, 409324) I hope that a determined movement will be set on foot to render residence on flats exposed to visitations of death dealing floods illegal.
('16', 175, 3, 24, 409463) The poor will, if they can, inhabit even such sites regardless of consequences.
('16', 175, 3, 25, 409543) It is for the enlightened persons to make it impossible for them to do so.
('16', 175, 4, 26, 409618) The issues of Indian Opinion that acquainted me with the

('16', 176, 1, 2, 409795) destruction caused by the floods gave me also the sad news of Mr. Abdul Gani’s 1 death.
('16', 176, 1, 3, 409883) Please convey my respectful condolences to the members of our friend’s family.
('16', 176, 1, 4, 409962) Mr. Abdul Gani’s services to the community can never be forgotten.
('16', 176, 1, 5, 410029) His sobriety of judgment and never failing courtesy would have done credit to anybody.
('16', 176, 1, 6, 410116) His wise handling of public questions was a demonstration of the fact that services to one’s country could be effectively rendered without a knowledge of English or modern training.
('16', 176, 1, 7, 410298) I note, too, that our people in South Africa are not yet free from difficulties about trade licences and leaving certificates.
('16', 176, 1, 8, 410425) My Indian experience has confirmed the opinion that there is no remedy like passive resistance against such evils.
('16', 176, 1, 9, 410540) The community has to exhaust milder remedies, but I hope that it will not allow the sword of passive resistance to get rusty.
('16', 176, 1, 10, 410666) It is our duty, whilst the terrible war lasts, to be satisfied with petitions, etc., for the desired relief, but I think the Government should know that the community will not rest until the questions above mentioned are satisfactorily solved.
('16', 176, 1, 11, 410910) It is but right that I should also warn the community against dangers from within.
('16', 176, 1, 12, 410993) I hear from those who return from South Africa that we are by no means free of those who are engaged in illicit traffic.
('16', 176, 1, 13, 411114) We, who seek justice, must be above suspicion, and I hope that our leaders will not rest till they have purged the community of internal defects.

('16', 177, 7, 12, 412177) Moreover, I have got some work for the Social Service League to attend to.
('16', 177, 7, 13, 412252) I feel that, while my star is in the ascendant, I should do all I can to spread my ideals.
('16', 177, 7, 14, 412343) Let us hope that, by being watchful about rats and maintaining cleanliness, we shall prevent the plague from spreading to the Ashram.

('16', 178, 6, 9, 413767) MOTIHARI, December 19, 1917
('16', 178, 7, 10, 413795) TO THE SECRETARY GOVERNMENT OF BIHAR AND ORISSA REVENUE DEPARTMENT [PATNA
('16', 178, 8, 11, 413869) SIR,] I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.
('16', 178, 8, 12, 413935) 116 II T 44 R.T. of the 6th December 1917, enclosing copy of the Champaran Agrarian Bill and inviting my remarks thereon.
('16', 178, 8, 13, 414057) 3 I beg to submit as follows:— (1) With reference to Section 4, I observe that although both sub sections (a) and (b) apply to the same transaction, sub section (a) covers a wider area than sub section (b), I have not been able to conjecture any reason for it.
('16', 178, 8, 14, 414318) But I suggest that the wording of sub section (b) may be copied for sub section (a) and, therefore, the word “condition” occurring in the second line of sub section (a) be removed.
('16', 178, 8, 15, 414499) And the words “Section 3” occurring in line 3 thereof may be replaced by “sub section 2 of Section 3”.
('16', 178, 8, 16, 414602) (2) With reference to Section 5, I beg to state that the Commit tee’s recommendations cover contracts between landlords and raiyats, not their tenants as well as their tenants.
('16', 178, 9, 17, 414779) 1 An inmate of Satyagraha Ashram, Sabarmati 2 Kasturba Gandhi was working in a school at Motihari.
('16', 178, 9, 18, 414878) 3 Copies of the Champaran Agrarian Bill, after it had been referred to the Select Committee were forwarded by the Revenue Secretary to Gandhiji, the Bihar Land Holders’ Association and the Bihar Planter’s Association for opinion.
('16', 179, 0, 1, 415108) 180 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 179, 1, 2, 415150) There are numerous cases in which raiyats enter into contracts with zamindars who are not their landlords.
('16', 179, 1, 3, 415257) It is necessary, therefore, to amend the wording “a tenant whether holding under him” occurring in line 2 thereof by saying “a tenant whether holding, under him or otherwise”, and by removing the words “grown upon the land of his tenancy or any portion thereof” occurring in lines 3 and 4 of the Section.
('16', 179, 1, 4, 415562) It is suggested that these last words are redundant.
('16', 179, 1, 5, 415615) It is intended that the Legislature should protect the raiyats in respect of all contracts as between zamindars and the raiyats concerning the sale of produce.
('16', 179, 1, 6, 415775) (3) With reference to Section 6, I fear that as it stands it is calculated to produce results the reverse of what is contemplated by the Government and the Committee.
('16', 179, 1, 7, 415942) Under sub section (1) thereof, an agent who is a mere straw may be put up by an unscrupulous landlord to collect abwab 1. Such an agent, if he is detected, will unhesitatingly suffer the penalties prescribed by the Section, as the landlord of the type mentioned by me will always make [it] worth his while to do so.
('16', 179, 1, 8, 416258) I, therefore, suggest that it is necessary in every case to make the landlord liable.
('16', 179, 1, 9, 416344) Sub section (1), therefore, should be amended by removing the words “or his agent” occurring in line 1 and by adding the words “whether directly or through an agent” after the pronoun “who” in the said line.
('16', 179, 1, 10, 416552) Sub section 3 of the said Section should be entirely removed.
('16', 179, 1, 11, 416614) It is possible for a poor ignorant raiyat to be in the right and yet be unable to prove his case.
('16', 179, 1, 12, 416712) It will be a gross injustice if such an innocent raiyat is punished.
('16', 179, 1, 13, 416781) Moreover, the existence of such sub section will act as an effective deterrent against any raiyats lodging a complaint about abwab.
('16', 179, 1, 14, 416913) It should be added that the power of punishing complainants for lodging false complaints is to be sparingly used.
('16', 179, 1, 15, 417027) It requires a highly trained judicial mind to arrive at a firm conclusion as to complaints being false.
('16', 179, 1, 16, 417131) It is, therefore, a dangerous thing to give summary powers to a Collector who will not be acting judicially.
('16', 179, 1, 17, 417240) Lastly, a single abortion of justice under sub section 3 is bound to result in an unscrupulous landlord being bolder in his exactions, for he will know that the raiyats after proceedings under sub section 3 will have been cowed down.
('16', 179, 1, 18, 417474) Considering all the above circumstances, I trust that the sub section in question will be removed.
('16', 179, 1, 19, 417573) If, however, it is found difficult to carry the amendments to

('16', 180, 1, 2, 417738) Section 6 as proposed by me, I suggest that the whole of the Section be withdrawn.
('16', 180, 1, 3, 417821) I would far rather have the less effective protection of Section 75 of the Bengal Tenancy Act than have the doubtful protection of Section 6.
('16', 180, 2, 4, 417963) (4) I observe that cart sattas 1 dealt with by the Committee have been covered by the proposed law.
('16', 180, 2, 5, 418063) There are such sattas running into anything between 7 and 20 years with the same rate of payment throughout.
('16', 180, 2, 6, 418172) Several planters in reply to questions by the Committee not being able to justify the terms of their sattas said that they did not enforce them as a matter of fact.
('16', 180, 2, 7, 418337) I venture to suggest that there ought to be a section declaring such sattas to be void.
('16', 180, 2, 8, 418425) New sattas, if necessary for short periods, may be entered into after the rate of hire is fixed in consultation with the Divisional Commissi oner.
('16', 180, 2, 9, 418572) I may state, even at the present moment, proceedings for damages for breach of these sattas are pending.
('16', 180, 3, 10, 418677) I have read the correspondence in the Press carried on by Messrs Irwin 2 and Jameson 3 and I have read also the speeches delivered by Messrs Jameson and Kennedy 4 in the Council on the Bill.
('16', 180, 3, 11, 418868) Regarding both I wish merely to state that there is a complete answer to every one of the statements made by these writers and speakers.
('16', 180, 3, 12, 419005) I have refrained from saying anything about them for fear of unnecessarily burdening the Government.
('16', 180, 3, 13, 419106) But should any point raised by these gentlemen require elucidation from me, I shall be pleased to offer my views on any such point on hearing from you.

('16', 181, 3, 6, 419993) I have great faith in you.
('16', 181, 3, 7, 420020) You are pure of heart, so you will not be trapped anywhere.
('16', 181, 3, 8, 420080) There is nothing wrong in working for a tailor.
('16', 181, 3, 9, 420128) Remove its impurity by your purity and the tailor’s profession will become even higher than that of the lawyer.
('16', 181, 3, 10, 420240) If you learn tailoring along with selling clothes, there is nothing wrong even in that.
('16', 181, 3, 11, 420328) It requires a sharp eye to learn cutting.
('16', 181, 3, 12, 420370) A good tailor requires much artistic ability.
('16', 181, 3, 13, 420416) Do freely whatever you think appropriate.
('16', 181, 3, 14, 420458) Preserve your health and your character and I shall be satisfied.
('16', 181, 3, 15, 420524) Manilal will be tested now.
('16', 181, 3, 16, 420552) If you want to go to his aid, do go.
('16', 181, 3, 17, 420589) I have suggested to him that he should continue to publish Indian Opinion even if he should be all alone.
('16', 181, 3, 18, 420695) He will send to you my letter to him for your information.
('16', 181, 3, 19, 420754) If he does not, ask for it.
('16', 181, 3, 20, 420782) I will go to Calcutta in a day or two.
('16', 181, 3, 21, 420821) Ba and Devdas will accompany me.
('16', 181, 3, 22, 420854) Naraharibhai and his wife are at present in Champaran with me.
('16', 181, 3, 23, 420917) He is a teacher in the National School.
('16', 181, 3, 24, 420957) Surendra is also here.
('16', 181, 3, 25, 420980) You may be knowing that Dr. Dev 1 is here.
('16', 181, 3, 26, 421023) Write to him some time.
('16', 181, 3, 27, 421047) It will do if you write in Gujarati.
('16', 181, 3, 28, 421084) Tafazzul Hussain Khan of Aligarh, who joined us from Tundla, was remembering you.
('16', 181, 3, 29, 421166) I had been to Aligarh 2. It is very pleasant cold weather here now.
('16', 181, 3, 30, 421234) The others are new volunteers.
('16', 181, 3, 31, 421265) You don’t know them.
('16', 181, 3, 32, 421286) Therefore I am not giving you their names.
('16', 181, 3, 33, 421329) More next time.

('16', 182, 2, 3, 421576) MOTIHARI, Magshar Sud 8 [December 21, 1917]
('16', 182, 3, 4, 421620) JAMNADAS,
('16', 182, 4, 5, 421630) I have not been able to write to you [as frequently] as I would wish.
('16', 182, 4, 6, 421700) I sometimes feel like writing to Meva 1 , too.
('16', 182, 4, 7, 421747) Sometimes I put off writing in the hope of being able to write a good letter and then it happens that I do not even write an indifferent one.
('16', 182, 4, 8, 421889) I should like you not to be irregular in writing letters.
('16', 182, 4, 9, 421947) I have not read your translation.
('16', 182, 4, 10, 421981) I am handing it over to Mahadev 2 today.
('16', 182, 4, 11, 422022) He at any rate will read it and write to you.
('16', 182, 4, 12, 422068) I shall also go over it.
('16', 182, 4, 13, 422093) But I shall take some time.
('16', 182, 4, 14, 422121) I have one by Valjibhai 3 too.
('16', 182, 4, 15, 422152) I shall send it to you to have a look at.
('16', 182, 4, 16, 422194) I am sending you a volume brought out by Natesan.
('16', 182, 5, 17, 422244) Stay there without any worry and go on with your work.
('16', 182, 5, 18, 422299) The Doctor is all love for you.
('16', 182, 5, 19, 422331) Don’t be disheartened.
('16', 182, 5, 20, 422354) You may not be doing as well as you would like to, but anyone who makes an honest effort is bound to produce a good impression on others.
('16', 182, 5, 21, 422492) Let me also know how things are with Meva.
('16', 182, 5, 22, 422535) How is your health ?
('16', 182, 6, 23, 422556) My activities are expanding.
('16', 182, 6, 24, 422585) I am wearing myself out in placing my ideals before the country while my star is in the ascendant.
('16', 182, 7, 25, 422684) Mahadev will give you some idea about the situation here.
('16', 182, 7, 26, 422742) He has joined only recently but is an old hand already.
('16', 182, 8, 27, 422798) Manilal is being severely tried in Phoenix.
('16', 182, 8, 28, 422842) Write to him, as also to Ramdas 5. The latter has taken up service with a tailor in Johannesburg.
('16', 182, 8, 29, 422940) Ba and Devdas will go with me to Calcutta.
('16', 182, 8, 30, 422983) I shall be there up to the 30th.

('16', 183, 1, 4, 423493) But that is a risk to be taken only when you desire it.
('16', 183, 1, 5, 423549) I know there can be nothing better for you than to stay with Jamnadas at present.

('16', 183, 4, 8, 423766) MOTIHARI, December 21, 1917
('16', 183, 5, 9, 423794) DEAR BHAI AMBALALJI, I do not wish to interfere with your business affairs at all.
('16', 183, 5, 10, 423877) However, I have had a letter from Krishnalal 1 today which leaves me no option but to write.
('16', 183, 5, 11, 423970) I think you should satisfy the weavers for the sake of Shrimati Anasuyabehn 2 at any rate.
('16', 183, 5, 12, 424061) There is no reason to believe that, if you satisfy these, you will have others clamouring.
('16', 183, 5, 13, 424152) Even if that should happen, you can do what you think fit then.
('16', 183, 5, 14, 424216) Why should not the mill owners feel happy paying a little more to the workers?
('16', 183, 5, 15, 424295) There is only one royal road to remove their discontent: entering their lives and binding them with the silken thread of love.
('16', 183, 5, 16, 424422) This is not beyond India.
('16', 183, 5, 17, 424448) Ultimately, the right use of money is to spend it for the country; if you spend money for the country, it is bound to yield fruit.
('16', 183, 5, 18, 424579) How could a brother be the cause of suffering to a sister?—and that, too, a sister like Anasuyabehn?
('16', 183, 5, 19, 424680) I have found that she has a soul which is absolutely pure.
('16', 183, 5, 20, 424739) It would be nothing strange if you took her word to be law.
('16', 183, 5, 21, 424799) You are, thus, under a double obligation: to please the workers and earn a sister’s blessings.
('16', 183, 5, 22, 424894) My presumption, too, is doubly serious; in a single letter I have meddled in your business and your family affairs.
('16', 183, 5, 23, 425010) Do forgive me.

('16', 184, 2, 3, 425298) MOTIHARI, December 21, 1917
('16', 184, 3, 4, 425326) MY DEAR FRIEND,
('16', 184, 4, 5, 425342) I have been irregular of late.
('16', 184, 4, 6, 425373) I have been wandering so much that I never have the leisure to write love letters especially when they get lost.
('16', 184, 4, 7, 425486) From you I had had only three letters during the past three months.
('16', 184, 4, 8, 425554) Polak has however written to me about you and so has Miss Winterbottom 2. How often do I not want to hug you.
('16', 184, 4, 9, 425664) Daily do I have novel experiences here which I should like you to share with me.
('16', 184, 4, 10, 425745) But this monstrous War never seems to be ending.
('16', 184, 4, 11, 425794) All the peace talk only enhances the agony.
('16', 184, 4, 12, 425838) However, like all human institutions it must have an end, and our friendship must be a poor affair if it cannot bide its time and be all the stronger and purer for the weary waiting.
('16', 184, 4, 13, 426021) And what is this physical form after all?
('16', 184, 4, 14, 426063) As I was whizzing through the air yesterday and looking at the trees, I saw that beneath all the change that these mighty trees daily underwent, there was a something that persisted.
('16', 184, 4, 15, 426246) Every leaf has its own separate life.
('16', 184, 4, 16, 426284) It drops and withers.
('16', 184, 4, 17, 426306) But the tree lives on.
('16', 184, 4, 18, 426329) Every tree falls in process of time or under the cruel axe, but the forest of which the tree is but a part lives and so with us leaves of the human tree.
('16', 184, 4, 19, 426483) We may wither, but the eternal in us lives on, changeless and endless.
('16', 184, 4, 20, 426554) I derived much comfort last evening as I was thus musing.
('16', 184, 4, 21, 426612) The thoughts went on to you and I sighed, but I regained self possession and said to myself, “I know my friend not for his form but for that which informs him.”
('16', 184, 5, 22, 426773) With love,
('16', 184, 6, 23, 426784) Your old friend,

('16', 185, 8, 11, 428168) CALCUTTA, December 29, 1917
('16', 185, 9, 12, 428196) This Congress re expresses its regret that the British Indians of South Africa still labour under disabilities which materially affect their trade and render their residence difficult, and unjustly and unduly restrict their movement to and in these parts of the Empire, and hopes that the local authorities will realise their responsibility to the Indians
('16', 185, 10, 13, 428552) 1 The Conference which was scheduled to be held on December 27 at Calcutta University Institute Hall had to be postponed because of difficulty in accommodating the unprecedented crowd of people who had turned up to hear Gandhiji and others.
('16', 185, 10, 14, 428793) 2 After the postponement of the Social Service Conference, Gandhiji gave an interview to The Bengalee, of which only a brief report is available.
('16', 185, 10, 15, 428939) 3 This was the thirteenth resolution passed at the 32nd Indian National Congress Session at Calcutta and was moved by Gandhiji.
('16', 185, 10, 16, 429067) He spoke in Hindi.

('16', 186, 5, 6, 429494) CALCUTTA, December 30, 1917
('16', 186, 6, 7, 429522) That this Conference is of opinion that the measures adopted by the Government and certain associations for the education and elevation of the depressed classes have served the purpose of drawing public attention to the existence of degrading social inequality and to their detrimental influence on the general progress of the country.
('16', 186, 6, 8, 429858) But in the opinion of this Conference, the measures hitherto adopted are quite inadequate to meet these evils.
('16', 186, 6, 9, 429969) This Conference, therefore, urges upon the Government and Social Reform Bodies (1) to provide greater facilities for the education of the depressed classes, and (2) to enforce equality of treatment in all public institutions so as to remove the prejudice and disabilities of untouchableness.

('16', 187, 3, 4, 430654) .Mr. Gandhi said agriculture was the principal occupation of the Indians and that it was a most honourable profession.
('16', 187, 3, 5, 430773) The speaker had worked among agriculturists and knew all their wants, grievances complaints, and needs.
('16', 187, 3, 6, 430877) He would, however, very soon take to agriculture himself and try to do what he could to improve the lot of the peasantry.
('16', 187, 3, 7, 430999) He sincerely hoped that the peasants would very soon improve their conditions.
('16', 187, 3, 8, 431078) As he had come with Pandit Malaviyaji on their way to some other place, he was forced to be very short.

('16', 187, 7, 14, 431418) Even Queen Victoria learned Hindi.
('16', 187, 7, 15, 431453) It is my submission to Malaviyaji that he should see to it that, at the Congress next year, no speeches are made in any language except Hindi.
('16', 187, 7, 16, 431596) My complaint is that, at the Congress yesterday, he did not speak in Hindi.

('16', 188, 3, 4, 432214) That, in view of the fact that the Hindi language is very widely used by the people of the different provinces and is easily understood by the majority of them, it seems practicable to take advantage of this language as a common language for India.

('16', 188, 6, 8, 432563) Mr. Gandhi, in an Urdu speech, urged the futility of paper resolutions and appealed to them for solid work.
('16', 188, 6, 9, 432671) Everyone, whether a Mussulman or a Hindu, he said, should tell Government that, if they did not release them [Ali Brothers], they ought themselves to be interned with them.
('16', 188, 6, 10, 432844) He assured them, amidst loud cheers, that Hindus were, to a man, with them, in the agitation for the release of the Muslims interned.

('16', 188, 9, 14, 433074) .Mr. Gandhi regretted that there should be a lack of the understanding and knowledge of Hindi by Indians.
('16', 188, 9, 15, 433180) All were eager, he said, to do national service, but there could be no national service without a national tongue.
('16', 188, 9, 16, 433295) He regretted that his Bengali friends were committing national suicide by omitting to use their national tongue, without which one cannot reach hearts of the masses.
('16', 188, 9, 17, 433461) In that sense, the wide use of Hindi would come within the purview of humanitarianism.

('16', 188, 10, 19, 433575) 2 Gandiji attended the session of the League on the second day and spoke briefly about the treatment of the Ali Brothers.
('16', 188, 10, 20, 433697) 3 Gandhiji took the chair at a meeting held under the auspices of the Bengal and Bombay Humanitarian Funds.
('16', 188, 10, 21, 433805) In deference to the wish expressed by the audience, he addressed them in English; this is a summary of the speech.
('16', 188, 10, 22, 433920) Speaking later, in Hindi, Madan Mohan Malaviya deprecated animal sacrifice.
('16', 189, 0, 1, 433996) 190 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 189, 1, 2, 434038) Mr. Gandhi next passed to another phase of humanitarianism, viz., sacrifice of animals before goddesses and slaughter for food.
('16', 189, 1, 3, 434166) The Hindu shastras do not really advocate animal sacrifice.
('16', 189, 1, 4, 434226) This current practice is one of the many things which have passed under the name of Hinduism.
('16', 189, 1, 5, 434320) The Hindu religion aptly finds expression in the two apphorisms—”Harmlessness is the best form of religion” and “There is no force higher than Truth”, and these principles are incompatible with the cruel practice of animal sacrifice.

('16', 189, 3, 8, 434636) CALCUTTA, December 31, 1917
('16', 189, 4, 9, 434664) Mr. Gandhi in taking the chair spoke as follows:
('16', 189, 5, 10, 434713) If I want to hear music, I must come to Bengal.
('16', 189, 5, 11, 434761) If I want to listen to poetry, I must come to Bengal.
('16', 189, 5, 12, 434815) India is contained in Bengal, but not Bengal in India.
('16', 189, 5, 13, 434870) I heard some Marwari boys singing songs.
('16', 189, 5, 14, 434911) It was like jargon.
('16', 189, 5, 15, 434931) I told them to associate with the Bengalis.
('16', 189, 6, 16, 434975) He then delivered the following presidential address.
('16', 189, 7, 17, 435029) FRIENDS.
('16', 189, 7, 18, 435038) I thank you for the honour you have conferred upon me.
('16', 189, 7, 19, 435093) I was totally unprepared for the invitation to preside over the deliberations of this assembly.
('16', 189, 7, 20, 435189) I do not know that I am fitted for the task.
('16', 189, 7, 21, 435234) Having fixed views about the use of Hindi at national gatherings, I am always disinclined to speak in English.
('16', 189, 7, 22, 435345) And I felt that the time was not ripe for me to ask to be allowed to deliver the presidential speech in Hindi.
('16', 189, 7, 23, 435456) Moreover, I have not much faith in conferences.
('16', 189, 7, 24, 435504) Social service to be effective has to be rendered without noise.
('16', 189, 7, 25, 435569) It is best performed when the left hand knoweth not what the right is doing.
('16', 189, 7, 26, 435646) Sir Gibble’s work told because nobody knew it.
('16', 189, 7, 27, 435693) He could not be spoiled by praise or held back by blame.
('16', 189, 7, 28, 435750) Would that our service were of this nature !
('16', 189, 8, 29, 435795) 1 This presidential address was to have been delivered at the opening session of the conference on December 27, which was postponed; vide “Speech at All India Social Service Conference”, 27 12 1917. Taking no notice of the postponement, however, New India published it in its issue dated December 28. Gandhiji presided over and addressed the conference in the Y.M.C.A. premises.
('16', 190, 0, 1, 436174) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 191
('16', 190, 1, 2, 436220) Holding such views, it was not without considerable hesitation and misgivings that I obeyed the summons of the Reception Committee.
('16', 190, 1, 3, 436352) You will, therefore, pardon me if you find in me a candid critic rather than an enthusiast carrying the conference to its goal with confidence and assurance.
('16', 190, 2, 4, 436510) It seems to me then that I cannot do better than draw attention to some branches of social service which we have hitherto more or less ignored.
('16', 190, 3, 5, 436654) The greatest service we can render society is to free ourselves and it from the superstitious regard we have learnt to pay to the learning of the English language.
('16', 190, 3, 6, 436818) It is the medium of instruction in our schools and colleges.
('16', 190, 3, 7, 436879) It is becoming the lingua franca of the country.
('16', 190, 3, 8, 436928) Our best thoughts are expressed in it.
('16', 190, 3, 9, 436967) Lord Chelmsford hopes that it will soon take the place of the mother tongue in high families.
('16', 190, 3, 10, 437061) This belief in the necessity of English training has enslaved us.
('16', 190, 3, 11, 437127) It has unfitted us for true national service.
('16', 190, 3, 12, 437173) Were it not for force of habit, we could not fail to see that, by reason of English being the medium of instruction, our intellect has been segregated, we have been isolated from the masses, the best mind of the nation has become gagged and the masses have not received the benefit of the new ideas we have received.
('16', 190, 3, 13, 437490) We have been engaged these past sixty years in memorizing strange words and their pronunciation instead of assimilating facts.
('16', 190, 3, 14, 437617) In the place of building upon the foundation, training received from our parents, we have almost unlearnt it.
('16', 190, 3, 15, 437727) There is no parallel to this in history.
('16', 190, 3, 16, 437768) It is a national tragedy.
('16', 190, 3, 17, 437794) The first and the greatest social service we can render is to revert to our verna culars, to restore Hindi to its natural place as the national language and begin carrying on all our provincial proceedings in our respec tive vernaculars and national proceedings in Hindi.
('16', 190, 3, 18, 438066) We ought not to rest till our schools and colleges give us instruction through the vernaculars.
('16', 190, 3, 19, 438162) It ought not to be necessary even for the sake of our English friends to have to speak in English.
('16', 190, 3, 20, 438261) Every English civil and military officer has to know Hindi.
('16', 190, 3, 21, 438321) Most English merchants learn it because they need it for their business.
('16', 190, 3, 22, 438394) The day must soon come when our legislatures will debate national affairs in the vernaculars or Hindi, as the case may be.
('16', 190, 3, 23, 438517) Hitherto the masses have been strangers to their proceedings.
('16', 190, 3, 24, 438579) The vernacular papers have tried to undo the mischief a little.
('16', 190, 3, 25, 438643) But the task was beyond them.
('16', 190, 3, 26, 438673) The Patrika reserves its biting sarcasm, The Bengalee its learning, for ears tuned to English.
('16', 190, 3, 27, 438768) In this
('16', 191, 0, 1, 438776) 192 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 191, 1, 2, 438818) ancient land of cultured thinkers, the presence in our midst of a Tagore or a Bose or a Ray ought not to excite wonder.
('16', 191, 1, 3, 438938) Yet the painful fact is that there are so few of them.
('16', 191, 1, 4, 438993) You will forgive me if I have carried too long on a subject which, in your opinion, may hardly be treated as an item of social service.
('16', 191, 1, 5, 439129) I have however taken the liberty of mentioning the matter prominently as it is my conviction that all national activity suffers materially owing to this radical defect in our system of education.
('16', 191, 2, 6, 439325) Coming to more familiar items of social service, the list is appalling.
('16', 191, 2, 7, 439397) I shall select only those of which I have any knowledge.
('16', 191, 3, 8, 439454) Work in times of sporadic distress such as famine and floods is no doubt necessary and most praiseworthy.
('16', 191, 3, 9, 439560) But it produces no permanent results.
('16', 191, 3, 10, 439598) There are fields of social service in which there may be no renown but which may yield lasting results.
('16', 191, 3, 11, 439702) In 1914, cholera, fevers and plague together claimed 4,639,663 victims.
('16', 191, 3, 12, 439774) If so many had died fighting on the battle field during the War that is at present devastating Europe, we would have covered ourselves with glory and lovers of swaraj would need no further argument in support of their cause.
('16', 191, 3, 13, 439999) As it is, 4,639,663 have died a lingering death unmourned and their dying has brought us nothing but discredit.
('16', 191, 3, 14, 440111) A distinguished Englishman said the other day that Englishmen did all the thinking for us whilst we sat supine.
('16', 191, 3, 15, 440223) He added that most Englishmen basing their opinions on their English experience presented impossible or costly remedies for the evils they investigated.
('16', 191, 3, 16, 440376) There is much truth in the above statement.
('16', 191, 3, 17, 440420) In other countries, reformers have successfully grappled with epidemics.
('16', 191, 3, 18, 440493) Here Englishmen have tried and failed.
('16', 191, 3, 19, 440532) They have thought along Western lines, ignoring the vast differences, climatic and other, between Europe and India.
('16', 191, 3, 20, 440648) Our doctors and physicians have practically done nothing.
('16', 191, 3, 21, 440706) I am sure that half a dozen medical men of the front rank dedicating their lives to the work of eradicating the triple curse would succeed where Englishmen have failed.
('16', 191, 3, 22, 440875) I venture to suggest that the way lies not through finding out cures but through finding or rather applying preventive methods.
('16', 191, 3, 23, 441003) I prefer to use the participle “applying”, for I have it on the aforementioned authority that to drive out plague (and I add cholera and malaria) is absurdly simple.
('16', 191, 3, 24, 441169) There is no conflict of opinion as to the preventive methods.
('16', 191, 3, 25, 441231) We simply do not apply them.
('16', 191, 3, 26, 441260) We have made up our minds that the masses will not adopt them.
('16', 191, 3, 27, 441323) There could be no greater calumny uttered against them.
('16', 191, 3, 28, 441379) If we would
('16', 192, 0, 1, 441391) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 193
('16', 192, 1, 2, 441437) but stoop to conquer, they can be easily conquered.
('16', 192, 1, 3, 441489) The truth is that we expect the Government to do the work.
('16', 192, 1, 4, 441548) In my opinion, in this matter, the Government cannot lead; they can follow and help if we could lead.
('16', 192, 1, 5, 441650) Here, then, there is work enough for our doctors and an army of workers to help them.
('16', 192, 1, 6, 441736) I note that you in Bengal are working somewhat in this direction.
('16', 192, 1, 7, 441802) I may state that a small but earnest band of volunteers is at the present moment engaged in doing such work in Champaran.
('16', 192, 1, 8, 441924) They are posted in different villages.
('16', 192, 1, 9, 441963) There they teach the village children, they give medical aid to the sick and they give practical lessons in hygiene to the village folk by cleaning their wells and roads and showing them how to treat human excreta.
('16', 192, 1, 10, 442178) Nothing can yet be predicted as to results as the experiment is in its infancy.
('16', 192, 1, 11, 442258) This Conference may usefully appoint a community of doctors who would study rural conditions on the spot and draw up a course of instructions for the guidance of workers and of the people at large.
('16', 192, 1, 12, 442456) Nothing perhaps affords such splendid facility to every worker, wholetime or otherwise, for effective service as the relief of agony through which the 3rd class railway passengers are passing.
('16', 192, 1, 13, 442649) I feel keenly about this grievance not because I am in it, but I have gone to it as I have felt keenly about it.
('16', 192, 1, 14, 442762) This matter affects millions of our poor and middle class countrymen.
('16', 192, 1, 15, 442832) This helpless toleration of every inconvenience and insult is visibly deteriorating the nation, even as the cruel treatment to which we have subjected the so called depressed classes has made them indifferent to the laws of personal cleanliness and the very idea of self respect.
('16', 192, 1, 16, 443112) What else but downright degradation can await those who have to make a scramble always like mad animals for seats in a miserable compar tment, who have to swear and curse before they can speak through the window in order to get standing room, who have to wallow in dirt during their journey, who are served their food like dogs and eat it like them, who have ever to bend before those who are physically stronger than they and who, being packed like sardines in compartments, have to get such sleep as they can in a sitting posture for nights together ?
('16', 192, 1, 17, 443666) Railway servants swear at them, cheat them.
('16', 192, 1, 18, 443710) On the Howrah Lahore service, our friends from Kabul fill to the brim the cup of the misery of the third class travellers.
('16', 192, 1, 19, 443833) They become lords of the compartments they enter.
('16', 192, 1, 20, 443883) It is not possible for anyone to resist them.
('16', 192, 1, 21, 443929) They swear at you on the slightest pretext, exhaust the whole of the obscene vocabulary of Hindi language.
('16', 192, 1, 22, 444036) They do not hesitate to belabour you if you retort or in any way oppose them.
('16', 192, 1, 23, 444114) They usurp the best seats
('16', 193, 0, 1, 444140) 194 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 193, 1, 2, 444182) and insist on stretching themselves full length even in crowded compartments.
('16', 193, 1, 3, 444260) No compar tment is deemed too crowded for them to enter.
('16', 193, 1, 4, 444317) The travellers pati ently bear all their awful impertinence out of sheer helplessness.
('16', 193, 1, 5, 444404) They would, if they could, knock down the man who dared to swear at them as do these Kabulis.
('16', 193, 1, 6, 444498) But they are physically no match for the Kabulis and every Kabuli considers himself more than a match for any number of travellers from the plains.
('16', 193, 1, 7, 444646) This is not right.
('16', 193, 1, 8, 444665) The effect of this terrorizing on the national character cannot but be debasing.
('16', 193, 1, 9, 444746) We the educated few ought to deliver the travelling public from this scourge or for ever renounce our claim to speak on its behalf or to guide it.
('16', 193, 1, 10, 444893) I believe the Kabulis to be amenable to reason.
('16', 193, 1, 11, 444941) They are a God fearing people.
('16', 193, 1, 12, 444972) If you know their language, you can successfully appeal to their good sense.
('16', 193, 1, 13, 445049) But they are spoilt children of nature.
('16', 193, 1, 14, 445089) Cowards among us have used their undoubted physical strength for our nefarious purposes.
('16', 193, 1, 15, 445178) And they have now come to think that they can treat poor people as they choose and consider themselves above the law of the land.
('16', 193, 1, 16, 445308) Here is work enough for social service.
('16', 193, 1, 17, 445348) Volunteers for this class of work can board trains and educate the people to a sense of their duty, call in guards and other officials in order to remove over crowding, see that passengers leave and board trains without a scramble.
('16', 193, 1, 18, 445580) It is clear that until the Kabulis can be patiently taught to behave themselves, they ought to have a compartment all to themselves and they ought not to be permitted to enter any other compartment.
('16', 193, 1, 19, 445779) With the exception of providing additional plant, every one of the other evils attendant on railway travelling ought to be immediately redressed.
('16', 193, 1, 20, 445925) It is no answer that we have suffered the wrong so long.
('16', 193, 1, 21, 445982) Prescriptive rights cannot accrue to wrongs.
('16', 193, 2, 22, 446027) No less important is the problem of the depressed classes.
('16', 193, 2, 23, 446086) To lift them from the position to which Hindu society has reduced them is to remove a big blot on Hinduism.
('16', 193, 2, 24, 446194) The present treatment of these classes is a sin against religion and humanity.
('16', 193, 3, 25, 446273) But the work requires service of the highest order.
('16', 193, 3, 26, 446325) We shall make little headway by merely throwing schools at them.
('16', 193, 3, 27, 446390) We must change the attitude of the masses and of orthodoxy.
('16', 193, 3, 28, 446450) I have already shown that we have cut ourselves adrift from both.
('16', 193, 3, 29, 446516) We do not react on them.
('16', 193, 3, 30, 446541) We can do so only if we speak to them in their own language.
('16', 193, 3, 31, 446602) An anglicized India cannot speak to them with effect.
('16', 193, 3, 32, 446656) If we believe in Hinduism, we must approach them in the Hindu fashion.
('16', 193, 3, 33, 446727) We must do
('16', 194, 0, 1, 446738) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 195
('16', 194, 1, 2, 446784) tapasya and keep our Hinduism undefiled.
('16', 194, 1, 3, 446825) Pure and enlightened orthodoxy must be matched against superstitious and ignorant orthodoxy.
('16', 194, 1, 4, 446918) To restore to their proper status a fifth of our total population is a task worthy of any social service organization.
('16', 194, 2, 5, 447037) The bustees of Calcutta and the chawls of Bombay badly demand the devoted services of hundreds of social workers.
('16', 194, 2, 6, 447151) They send our infants to an early grave and promote vice, degradation and filth.
('16', 194, 3, 7, 447232) Apart from the fundamental evil arising out of our defective system of education, I have hitherto dealt with evils calling for service among the masses.
('16', 194, 3, 8, 447385) The classes perhaps demand no less attention than the masses.
('16', 194, 3, 9, 447447) It is my opinion that all evils like diseases are symptoms of the same evil or disease.
('16', 194, 3, 10, 447535) They appear various by being refracted through different media.
('16', 194, 3, 11, 447599) The root evil is loss of true spirituality brought about through causes I cannot examine from this platform.
('16', 194, 3, 12, 447708) We have lost the robust faith of our forefathers in the absolute efficacy of satya (truth) ahimsa (love) and brahmacharya (self restraint).
('16', 194, 3, 13, 447848) We certainly believe in them to an extent.
('16', 194, 3, 14, 447891) They are the best policy but we may deviate from them if our untrained reason suggests deviation.
('16', 194, 3, 15, 447989) We have not faith enough to feel that, though the present outlook seems bleak, if we follow the dictates of truth or love or exercise self restraint, the ultimate result must be sound.
('16', 194, 3, 16, 448174) Men whose spiritual vision has become blurred mostly look to the present rather than conserve the future good.
('16', 194, 3, 17, 448285) He will render the greatest social service who will reinstate us in our ancient spirituality.
('16', 194, 3, 18, 448379) But humble men that we are, it is enough for us if we recognize the loss and, by such ways as are open to us, prepare the way for the man who will infect us with his power and enable us to feel clearly through our reason.
('16', 194, 4, 19, 448601) Looking then at the classes, I find that our Rajahs and Maharajahs squander their resources after so called useless sport and drink.
('16', 194, 4, 20, 448734) I was told the other day that the cocaine habit was sapping the nation’s manhood and that, like the drink habit, it was on the increase and in its effect more deadly than drink.
('16', 194, 4, 21, 448912) It is impossible for a social worker to blind himself to the evil.
('16', 194, 4, 22, 448979) We dare not ape the West.
('16', 194, 4, 23, 449005) We are a nation that has lost its prestige and its self respect.
('16', 194, 4, 24, 449070) Whilst a tenth of our population is living on the verge of starvation, we have no time for indulging ourselves.
('16', 194, 4, 25, 449182) What the West may do with impunity is likely in our case to prove our ruin.
('16', 194, 4, 26, 449258) The evils that are corroding the higher strata of society are difficult for an ordinary worker to tackle.
('16', 195, 0, 1, 449364) 196 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 195, 1, 2, 449406) have acquired a certain degree of respecta bility.
('16', 195, 1, 3, 449457) But they ought not to be beyond the reach of this Conference.
('16', 195, 2, 4, 449519) Equally important is the question of the status of women, both Hindu and Mahomedan.
('16', 195, 2, 5, 449603) Are they or are they not to play their full part in the plan of regeneration alongside their husbands?
('16', 195, 2, 6, 449706) They must be enfranchised.
('16', 195, 2, 7, 449733) They can no longer be treated either as dolls or slaves without the social body remaining in a condition of social paralysis.
('16', 195, 2, 8, 449859) And here again, I would venture to suggest to the reformer that the way to women’s freedom is not through education, but through the change of attitude on the part of men and corresponding action.
('16', 195, 2, 9, 450056) Education is necessary, but it must follow the freedom.
('16', 195, 2, 10, 450112) We dare not wait for literary education to restore our womanhood to its proper state.
('16', 195, 2, 11, 450198) Even without literary education, our women are as cultured as any on the face of the earth.
('16', 195, 2, 12, 450290) The remedy largely lies in the hands of husbands.
('16', 195, 3, 13, 450340) It makes my blood boil as I wander through the country and watch lifeless and fleshless oxen, with their ribs sticking through their skins, carrying loads or ploughing our fields.
('16', 195, 3, 14, 450520) To improve the breed of our cattle, to rescue them from the cruelty practised on them by their cow worshipping masters and to save them from the slaughter house is to solve half the problem of our poverty.
('16', 195, 3, 15, 450726) We have to educate the people to a humane use of their cattle and plead with the Government to conserve the pasture land of the country.
('16', 195, 3, 16, 450863) Protection of the cow is an economic necessity.
('16', 195, 3, 17, 450911) It can not be brought about by force.
('16', 195, 3, 18, 450949) It can only be achieved by an appeal to the finer feelings of our English friends and our Mahomedan countrymen to save the cow from the slaughter house.
('16', 195, 3, 19, 451102) This question involves the overhauling of the management of our pinjrapoles and cow protection societies.
('16', 195, 3, 20, 451208) A proper solution of this very difficult problem means establishment of perfect concord between Hindus and Mahomedans and an end of Bakr i Id riots.
('16', 195, 3, 21, 451357) I have glanced at the literature kindly furnished at my request by the several Leagues who are rendering admirable social service.
('16', 195, 3, 22, 451488) I note that some have included in their programme many of the items mentioned by me.
('16', 195, 3, 23, 451573) All the Leagues are non sectarian and they have as their members the most distinguished men and women in the land.
('16', 195, 3, 24, 451688) the possibilities for services of a far reaching character are therefore great.
('16', 195, 3, 25, 451768) But if the work is to leave its impress on the nation, we must have workers who are prepared, in Mr. Gokhale’s words, to dedicate
('16', 196, 0, 1, 451898) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 197
('16', 196, 1, 2, 451944) their lives to the cause.
('16', 196, 1, 3, 451970) Give me such workers and I promise they will rid the land of all the evils that affict it.

('16', 196, 5, 7, 452145) DEVDAS, I have been waiting for your letter.
('16', 196, 5, 8, 452190) Let me know your daily programme.
('16', 196, 5, 9, 452224) Give me news about your health and that of Chhotalal and Surendra.
('16', 196, 5, 10, 452291) Send me a sample of cloth woven there.
('16', 196, 5, 11, 452330) What work is Avantikabehn doing in the women’s school?
('16', 196, 6, 12, 452385) As to news from here, what can I write to you now?
('16', 196, 6, 13, 452436) Mahadev has been flooding you with news.
('16', 196, 6, 14, 452477) The Hindi teacher has returned.
('16', 196, 6, 15, 452509) I believe our school will almost reach perfection.
('16', 196, 6, 16, 452560) At any rate, no effort will have been spared.
('16', 196, 6, 17, 452606) We have purchased another piece of land.
('16', 196, 7, 18, 452647) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] Chi.
('16', 196, 7, 19, 452678) Chhaganlal is now staying with Anasuyabehn.
('16', 196, 7, 20, 452722) [PPS.] I received your letter after the above was written.
('16', 196, 7, 21, 452781) I am very much pleased with what you have said.
('16', 196, 7, 22, 452829) I am equally dissatisfied with your handwriting.
('16', 196, 7, 23, 452878) Do please improve it.
('16', 196, 7, 24, 452900) I am constantly worried about your cough.
('16', 196, 7, 25, 452942) The cough has got to go.
('16', 196, 7, 26, 452967) Do you breathe sufficiently deeply?
('16', 196, 7, 27, 453003) Whenever you have cough, try salt free diet for a couple of days.
('16', 196, 7, 28, 453069) You should dispense with milk and ghee also and subsist on porridge and vegetables only.
('16', 196, 7, 29, 453158) By this means your body will be rid of all impurities and will begin to function as before.
('16', 196, 7, 30, 453250) But the main thing is that the root cause of cough should be removed.
('16', 196, 7, 31, 453320) To this end do your best when you are not actually suffering from it.
('16', 196, 7, 32, 453390) The best means is correct breathing.
('16', 196, 7, 33, 453427) Do not breathe perfunctorily.
('16', 196, 7, 34, 453457) Do you keep your mouth closed and head uncovered while asleep?
('16', 196, 8, 35, 453520) Blessings from BAPU

('16', 197, 2, 3, 453681) AHMEDABAD, January 1, 1918
('16', 197, 3, 4, 453708) TO J. L. MAFFEY, C.I.E., I.C.S. PRIVATE SECRETARY TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE VICEROY DELHI
('16', 197, 4, 5, 453794) [DEAR MR MAFFEY,] It grieves me to have to worry His Excellency in the midst of his many and onerous engagements.
('16', 197, 4, 6, 453908) But I think that I am rendering a service in writing this letter.
('16', 197, 4, 7, 453974) It is needless to say that I have been keenly following the agitation for the release of Messrs Muhammad Ali and Shaukat Ali.
('16', 197, 4, 8, 454100) I met their mother during my stay in Calcutta, and I ascertained the position of the brothers from her.
('16', 197, 4, 9, 454204) She gave me the fullest assurance that her sons were in no way disloyal to the British Raj, and that in the scheme of Reform they contemplated permanent retention of the British connection.
('16', 197, 4, 10, 454394) I have been attending the sessions of the Muslim League held there and I have moved freely among the leading Muhammadans.
('16', 197, 4, 11, 454516) It is my firm opinion that the continued internment of the two brothers and the refusal to discharge them is creating greater and greater dissatisfaction and irritation from day to day.
('16', 197, 4, 12, 454702) The Muhammadans, and also the Hindus for that matter, bitterly resent the internment.
('16', 197, 4, 13, 454788) I am sure that it is not a healthy feeling.
('16', 197, 4, 14, 454832) There is undoubted unrest among the Muham madans.
('16', 197, 4, 15, 454882) Discharge of the two brothers will, I am sure, greatly mitigate it.
('16', 197, 4, 16, 454950) It will not remove it entirely so long as the war lasts.
('16', 197, 4, 17, 455007) I had the privilege of supporting the resolution passed at the League about the release of the brothers.
('16', 197, 4, 18, 455112) 1 The audience were weeping whilst their mother’s address was being recited.
('16', 197, 4, 19, 455189) I am prepared to give due assurances to the Government about their future conduct.
('16', 197, 4, 20, 455272) I feel that, in order to be able to live a healthy public life, either the brothers should be discharged or should be properly tried and convicted.
('16', 197, 4, 21, 455420) I recognize the danger at the present moment of having a public trial and all it means.
('16', 197, 4, 22, 455508) But I am certain that the continued imprisonment is no less dangerous.
('16', 197, 4, 23, 455579) I therefore suggest that I should be allowed to go to Chindwara and visit the brothers.
('16', 197, 5, 24, 455667) 1 This was at the 1917 session of the Muslim League in Calcutta.

('16', 198, 1, 2, 455778) would get from them a public declaration of their loyalty, on the strength of which they may, in my humble opinion, be discharged without risk of public peace being in any way imperilled.
('16', 198, 2, 3, 455966) I may add that I know the brothers well.
('16', 198, 2, 4, 456007) They are intensely devoted to their religion and equally devoted to India.
('16', 198, 2, 5, 456082) I make bold to say that they will not make to me a statement which they do not fully intend to carry out.
('16', 198, 2, 6, 456188) I hope, therefore, that the permission I have requested will be granted me.
('16', 198, 2, 7, 456264) Will you kindly place my request before His Excellency?
('16', 198, 2, 8, 456320) I need hardly say that I should be pleased to run down to Delhi if my presence is required.
('16', 198, 2, 9, 456412) My address up to the 10th instant will be Ahmedabad and Motihari, Champaran from the 13th.

('16', 198, 8, 17, 456742) The problem of Kathiawad is all the time in my mind.
('16', 198, 8, 18, 456795) 1 I am looking out for an opportunity.
('16', 198, 8, 19, 456834) I don’t propose to associate myself with the activities of the Cutch Kathiawad Mandal.
('16', 198, 8, 20, 456921) I think they are premature.
('16', 198, 8, 21, 456949) I have told the organisers as much.

('16', 199, 1, 2, 457326) 100. SPEECH AT AHMEDABAD MEETING 1
('16', 199, 2, 3, 457361) AHMEDABAD, January 1, 1918
('16', 199, 3, 4, 457388) We meet here today on a matter which is important because it is but an aspect of swaraj.
('16', 199, 3, 5, 457477) In saying this, we are guilty of no exaggeration.
('16', 199, 3, 6, 457527) Swaraj means rule over oneself.
('16', 199, 3, 7, 457559) A meeting which asks whether the Ahmedabad Municipality is able to manage its affairs well is surely a meeting in the cause of swaraj.
('16', 199, 3, 8, 457694) The subject to be discussed at this meeting has a bearing on public health.
('16', 199, 3, 9, 457770) Air, water and grains are the three chief kinds of food.
('16', 199, 3, 10, 457827) Air is free to all, but, if it is polluted, it harms our health.
('16', 199, 3, 11, 457892) Doctors say that bad air is more harmful than bad water.
('16', 199, 3, 12, 457949) Inhalation of bad air is harmful by itself and this is the reason we [sometimes] need change of air.
('16', 199, 3, 13, 458050) Next comes water.
('16', 199, 3, 14, 458068) We are generally very careless about it.
('16', 199, 3, 15, 458109) If we were to be sufficiently careful about air, water and food, the plague would never make its appearance among us.
('16', 199, 3, 16, 458227) Some parts of Ahmedabad have been experiencing difficulties about water during the last eight years.
('16', 199, 3, 17, 458328) For these three months, the whole city has been in difficulty, and we have assembled here to protest against this to the Collector of Ahmedabad, the Commissioner of the Northern Division and the Municipal Commissioner.
('16', 199, 3, 18, 458547) From now on we must take up the effort to secure water.
('16', 199, 3, 19, 458603) Councillors are servants of the people and we have a right to question them and, if they fail to discharge their responsibilities properly, even to ask them to resign.
('16', 199, 3, 20, 458771) Under one of the sections of the [Municipal] Act, the Municipal Commissioner is appointed by the Government.
('16', 199, 3, 21, 458880) We are also entitled to call the Municipal Commissioner and the Municipal Engineer to account; we have assembled here to take even further steps, if necessary.
('16', 199, 3, 22, 459040) The larger the attendance at a meeting like this, discussing an issue of public importance, the weightier will be its protest.
('16', 199, 3, 23, 459167) I should like to request you all not to rest till you have succeeded in this effort.
('16', 199, 3, 24, 459252) If we approach every problem as seriously as we would a task of the highest importance, we are bound to succeed.
('16', 199, 3, 25, 459365) We have the right to demand our money back.
('16', 199, 3, 26, 459409) 2 We must protest, for, otherwise, the officials will never know what
('16', 199, 4, 27, 459479) 1 The meeting was called to protest against insufficient and irregular supply of water.
('16', 199, 4, 28, 459567) Gandhiji presided.
('16', 199, 4, 29, 459586) 2 Following are the remarks made by Gandhiji after the main resolution of the meeting had been moved and discussed.

('16', 200, 4, 6, 459927) [After January 11, 1918] I liked very much what you did.
('16', 200, 4, 7, 459984) It did not take the Commissioner 1 more than a moment to come out in his true colours.
('16', 200, 4, 8, 460071) I am not being censorious but I say it for your future guidance that, when the Commissioner refused to see all the members of the deputation, the secretaries would have done well, out of self respect, to withdraw 2 ...Mr. Pratt’s error will make things easier for the people.
('16', 200, 4, 9, 460347) If he wants to ignore the Gujarat Sabha, let him.
('16', 200, 4, 10, 460397) 3 If you are strong enough, stand by the people fearlessly and advise them not to pay the assessment.
('16', 200, 4, 11, 460499) If you are arrested in consequence, you will have done your duty ....Don’t worry about the results.
('16', 200, 4, 12, 460599) This is what satyagraha means.
('16', 200, 4, 13, 460630) You may be sure this is the only way to win the fullest respect for ourselves.
('16', 200, 4, 14, 460709) Quite likely, we may not succeed in the immediate present.
('16', 200, 4, 15, 460768) It is our supreme duty to take every occasion to show in action the wonderful power of satyagraha.

('16', 200, 6, 19, 460967) 2 Excessive rainfall in 1917 had caused failure of crops in the Kheda district.
('16', 200, 6, 20, 461047) The Gujarat Sabha, a body established in 1884 to represent people’s grievances to the Government, had supported the peasants’ demand for postponement of land revenue assessment.
('16', 200, 6, 21, 461225) On January 1, the Sabha wrote to the Bombay Government urging exemption in some cases and postponement in others.
('16', 200, 6, 22, 461339) Gandhiji visited Ahmedabad and, after a study of the problem, advised the Sabha of which he was President, to ask the people to suspend payment till a reply had been received from the Bombay Government.
('16', 200, 6, 23, 461542) He also suggested to the Sabha to lead a deputation to the Commissioner.
('16', 200, 6, 24, 461615) On January 10, the Sabha sought an appointment.
('16', 200, 6, 25, 461663) When the deputation called at the office of the Commissioner, he agreed to see only the Secretaries, Krishnalal Desai and G. V. Mavlankar.
('16', 200, 6, 26, 461802) Gandhiji was informed of this by telegram.
('16', 200, 6, 27, 461845) 3 During the interviews the Commissioner had stated that he might recommend to Government that the Sabha be declared an illegal body.

('16', 201, 2, 5, 462141) Do not back out of the task you have undertaken.
('16', 201, 2, 6, 462190) In fact you don’t need me or anyone else.
('16', 201, 2, 7, 462232) Those who are unable to pay the land revenue will remain so, whether or no the Government admits their inability.
('16', 201, 2, 8, 462346) Why should they pay it, then?
('16', 201, 2, 9, 462376) This is all you have to explain to the people.
('16', 201, 2, 10, 462423) Even if only one person remains firm, he will have won the battle.
('16', 201, 2, 11, 462490) From this, we shall be able to raise a new crop.

('16', 201, 5, 16, 462630) [SABARMATI, Before January 13, 1918] To those of you who would like to have jobs, I can at present offer two kind of work: (l) Construction work on a building for this Satyagraha Ashrarm is about to begin.
('16', 201, 5, 17, 462836) If anyone desiring employment agree to work on this, I shall very much appreciate his help.
('16', 201, 5, 18, 462928) I can pay him Rs. 15/ p.m.
('16', 201, 5, 19, 462955) I feel, too, that, if they help to build the Ashram with their labour, they will not only earn much credit for themselves, but also raise the prestige of the Ashram.
('16', 201, 5, 20, 463121) (2) I can also arrange that those of you who would like to promote swadeshi industries are taught hand weaving free of charge.
('16', 201, 5, 21, 463248) I can do more: supply the required yarn and help to market the cloth woven.
('16', 201, 5, 22, 463324) Those who are so inclined may therefore let me knows I think this is probably the best way of combining self interest with service to the country.

('16', 202, 2, 3, 463794) MOTIHARI, January 13, 1918 1
('16', 202, 3, 4, 463823) MY DEAR ESTHER, Having been wandering about, I have not been able to reply to your letters.
('16', 202, 3, 5, 463915) I was in Calcutta, thence went to Bombay and the Ashram and returned only yesterday.
('16', 202, 3, 6, 464000) I had varied experiences which I cannot describe for want of time.
('16', 202, 3, 7, 464067) To say that perfection is not attainable on this earth is to deny God.
('16', 202, 3, 8, 464138) The statement about impossibility of ridding ourselves of sin clearly refers to a stage in life.
('16', 202, 3, 9, 464235) But we need not search scriptures in support of the assertion.
('16', 202, 3, 10, 464298) We do see men constantly becoming better under effort and discipline.
('16', 202, 3, 11, 464368) There is no occasion for limiting the capacity for improvement.
('16', 202, 3, 12, 464432) Life to me would lose all its interest if I feel that I could not attain perfect love on earth.
('16', 202, 3, 13, 464528) After all, what matters is that our capacity for loving ever expands.
('16', 202, 3, 14, 464598) It is a slow process.
('16', 202, 3, 15, 464620) How shall you love the men who thwart you even in well doing?
('16', 202, 3, 16, 464682) And yet that is the time of supreme test.
('16', 202, 3, 17, 464724) I hope that you are now enjoying greater peace of mind.
('16', 202, 3, 18, 464780) Let your love for the Ashram be a source 2 of strength in your attempt to do your duty there.
('16', 202, 3, 19, 464874) 3 The Ashram is undoubtedly intended to teach us to do our assigned task with the utmost attention and with cheerfulness.
('16', 202, 3, 20, 464996) There is meaning in our wishes (however pure) not being fulfilled.
('16', 202, 3, 21, 465063) Not our will but His will be done.
('16', 202, 3, 22, 465098) I hope you are making progress in your Tamil lessons.
('16', 202, 3, 23, 465152) Did you receive from Messrs Natesan & Co.
('16', 202, 3, 24, 465194) a book they have brought out containing my speeches and writings ?
('16', 202, 3, 25, 465261) I am sending you a copy of my speech in Calcutta on Social Service.
('16', 202, 4, 26, 465329) With love.

('16', 203, 3, 4, 465767) BHAISHRI CHIMANLAL (CHINAIWALA), I have your letter.
('16', 203, 3, 5, 465820) It is our duty to help every class of workers.
('16', 203, 3, 6, 465867) I have no doubt about this.
('16', 203, 3, 7, 465895) I have little faith in what goes under the name of “co operation”.
('16', 203, 3, 8, 465962) I think our first task is to make a careful survey of the conditions of the working class.
('16', 203, 3, 9, 466053) What does the worker earn?
('16', 203, 3, 10, 466080) Where does he live?
('16', 203, 3, 11, 466100) In what condition?
('16', 203, 3, 12, 466119) How much does he spend ?
('16', 203, 3, 13, 466144) How much does he save ?
('16', 203, 3, 14, 466168) What debts does he incur?
('16', 203, 3, 15, 466194) How many children has he?
('16', 203, 3, 16, 466220) How does he bring them up?
('16', 203, 3, 17, 466247) What was he previously?
('16', 203, 3, 18, 466271) What brought about the change in his life?
('16', 203, 3, 19, 466314) What is his present condition?
('16', 203, 3, 20, 466345) It does not seem proper at all to start a co operative society straightway, without finding answers to all these questions.
('16', 203, 3, 21, 466469) It is necessary that we go into the midst of the working class.
('16', 203, 3, 22, 466533) If we do, we can solve a number of problems in a very short time.
('16', 203, 3, 23, 466599) For the moment, I should just advise you to mix with the workers and make yourself familiar with their condition.
('16', 203, 3, 24, 466713) More when we meet.

('16', 203, 7, 31, 467023) 1 The fact is that I have been travelling out of Champaran.
('16', 203, 7, 32, 467083) I returned only on the 12th instant.

('16', 204, 7, 11, 467799) MATHURADAS,
('16', 204, 8, 12, 467811) 1 can now understand your criticism of the translation of the section on education.
('16', 204, 8, 13, 467895) I started reading it 2 with the idea of writing the introduction.
('16', 204, 8, 14, 467961) The very first sentence put me off.
('16', 204, 8, 15, 467997) My trepidation increased as I read further on.
('16', 204, 8, 16, 468044) It seems to me that it would be unfair to put this translation before the public.
('16', 204, 8, 17, 468126) Hence even though it would mean so much money wasted, we really have no alternative.
('16', 204, 8, 18, 468211) Right now we need do no more than take the decision.
('16', 204, 8, 19, 468264) We shall hold back this translation and not get it bound.
('16', 204, 8, 20, 468322) We shall have the second and third parts published as volume one.
('16', 204, 8, 21, 468388) The pages should be renumbered.
('16', 204, 8, 22, 468420) I assume from what you say that we can bring out the volume before 19th February 3. The Gujarati of the translation should be simple, natural, free from grammatical blemishes and should possess literary beauty.
('16', 204, 8, 23, 468631) I see none of these qualities in the present translation.
('16', 204, 9, 24, 468689) Please feel free to make such critical comments on parts two and three as you consider necessary.
('16', 204, 9, 25, 468787) I shall start drafting the introduction after I have received at least some of the proofs.
('16', 204, 9, 26, 468878) Arrange to have the first forme printed after I get the proofs.
('16', 204, 9, 27, 468942) I shall return the forme immediately.
('16', 204, 9, 28, 468980) We shall have to make the full payment to the printer.
('16', 204, 9, 29, 469035) It will be nice if he can reduce the printing charges when we reprint the section on education.
('16', 204, 9, 30, 469131) If you feel so inclined, you can take up the

('16', 205, 2, 4, 469659) I can see that you have done very well in correcting the proofs.
('16', 205, 2, 5, 469724) As a rule, we should work in such a way that we do not have to give errata.
('16', 205, 2, 6, 469800) From whatever little I have read, I can see that you have been able to follow that rule.

('16', 206, 3, 4, 470485) TO L. F. MORSHEAD COMMISSIONER TIRHUT DIVISION BIHAR
('16', 206, 4, 5, 470538) DEAR MR. MORSHEAD,
('16', 206, 5, 6, 470557) I have your letter 1 of the 14th instant.
('16', 206, 5, 7, 470599) I have now carefully gone through the Bill.
('16', 206, 5, 8, 470643) I see that I must revise the view that I took of Mr. Kennedy’s amendment 2 in my conversation with you.
('16', 206, 5, 9, 470747) I fear that his amendment will not meet the case if it is to cover the whole of section 3. I can accept Amendment marked A in place of clause 2, section 3. Mr. Kennedy’s proviso marked B by you is wholly unacceptable.
('16', 206, 5, 10, 470965) Clause 1 of section 3 is necessary for the repeal of contractual tinkathia 3. Section 5 subject to the amendment suggested by me in my letter to the Government, dated l9th December, is necessary to give effect to the other recommendation of the Committee beyond recognition of khuski 4 contracts.
('16', 206, 5, 11, 471262) My position is clear.
('16', 206, 5, 12, 471284) I would consider pledging of a tenant’s land for the growing of particular crops as a revival of tinkathia.
('16', 206, 5, 13, 471392) Mr. Kennedy’s effort, if I have understood him correctly, is devoted to securing such pledging.
('16', 206, 5, 14, 471488) Between these two extremes there is no meeting ground.

('16', 207, 2, 3, 472214) MOTIHARI, January 16, 1918
('16', 207, 4, 4, 472241) THE EDITOR
('16', 207, 5, 5, 472252) THE STATESMAN [CALCUTTA]
('16', 207, 7, 6, 472277) Mr. Irwin’s latest letter published in your issue of the 12th instant 1 compels me to court the hospitality of your columns.
('16', 207, 7, 7, 472402) So long as your correspondent confined himself to matters directly affecting himself, his misrepresentations did not much matter, as the real facts were as much within the knowledge of the Government and those who are concerned with the agrarian question in Champaran, as within mine.
('16', 207, 7, 8, 472687) But in the letter under notice, he has travelled outside his jurisdiction as it were, and unchivalrously attacked one of the most innocent women walking on the face of the earth (and this I say although she happens to be my wife) and has unpardonably referred to a question of the greatest moment, I mean, the cow protection question, without taking the precaution, as behoves a gentleman, of ascertaining facts at first hand.
('16', 207, 7, 9, 473114) My address to the Gau Rakshini Sabha 2 he could have easily obtained upon application to me.
('16', 207, 7, 10, 473207) This at least was due to me as between man and man.
('16', 207, 7, 11, 473259) Your correspondent accuses me of “making a united attack on Saheb log (the landlords) who slaughter and eat cows daily”.
('16', 207, 7, 12, 473380) This presupposes I was addressing a comparatively microscopic audience of the planters’ ryots.
('16', 207, 7, 13, 473475) The fact is that the audience was composed chiefly of the non ryot class.
('16', 207, 7, 14, 473549) But I had in mind a much bigger audience, and not merely the few thousand hearers before me.
('16', 207, 7, 15, 473642) I spoke under a full sense of my responsibility.
('16', 207, 7, 16, 473691) The question of cow protection is, in my opinion, as large as the Empire to which Mr. Irwin and I belong.
('16', 207, 7, 17, 473797) I know that he is a proud father of a young lad of twenty four, who has received by his gallantry the unique honour of a colonelcy at his age.
('16', 207, 7, 18, 473940) Mr. Irwin can, if he will, obtain a greater honour for himself by studying the cow
('16', 207, 8, 19, 474023) 1 Irwin’s letter of January 8 was published actually on January 11; vide Appendix “W.S. Irwin’s Letter to The Statesman”, 8 1 1918. 2 Vide “Speech on Cow Protection, Bettiah” about October 9, 1917.
('16', 208, 0, 1, 474221) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 209
('16', 208, 1, 2, 474267) question and taking his full share in its solution.
('16', 208, 1, 3, 474319) He will, I promise, be then much better occupied than when he is dashing off his misrepr esentations to be published in the Press and most unnecessarily preparing to bring 2,200 cases against his tenants for the sake of deriving the questionable pleasure of deeming me responsible for those cases.
('16', 208, 1, 4, 474617) I said at the meeting that the Hindus had no warrant for resenting the slaughter of cows by their Mahomedan brethren, who kill them from religious conviction, so long as they themselves were a party to the killing by inches of thousands of cattle who were horribly ill treated by their Hindu owners, to the drinking of milk drawn from cows in the inhuman dairies of Calcutta, and so long as they calmly contemplated the slaughter of thousands of cattle in the slaughter houses of India for providing beef for the European and Christian residents of India.
('16', 208, 1, 5, 475173) I suggested that the first step towards procuring full protection for cows was to put their own house in order by securing absolute immunity from ill treatment of their cattle by Hindus themselves, and then to appeal to the Europeans to abstain from beef eating whilst resident in India, or at least to procure beef from outside India.
('16', 208, 1, 6, 475509) I added that in no case could the cow protection propaganda, if it was to be based upon religious conviction, tolerate a sacrifice of Mahomedans for the sake of saving cows, that the religious method of securing protection from Christians and Mahomedans alike was for Hindus to offer themselves a willing sacrifice of sufficient magnitude to draw out the merciful nature of Christians and Mahomedans.
('16', 208, 1, 7, 475910) Rightly or wrongly, worship of the cow is ingrained in the Hindu nature and I see no escape from a most bigoted and sanguinary strife over this question between Christians and Mahomedans on the one hand and Hindus on the other except in the fullest recognition and practice by the Hindus of the religion of ahimsa, which it is my self imposed and humble mission in life to preach.
('16', 208, 1, 8, 476291) Let the truth be faced.
('16', 208, 1, 9, 476315) It must not be supposed that Hindus feel nothing about the cow slaughter going on for the European.
('16', 208, 1, 10, 476415) I know that their wrath is today being buried under the awe inspired by the English rule.
('16', 208, 1, 11, 476505) But there is not a Hindu throughout the length and breadth of India who does not expect one day to free his land from cow slaughter.
('16', 208, 1, 12, 476638) But contrary to the genius of Hinduism as I know it, he would not mind forcing, even at the point of the sword, either the Christian or the Mahomedan to abandon cow slaughter.
('16', 208, 1, 13, 476814) I wish to play my humble part in preventing such a catastrophe and I thank Mr. Irwin for having provided me with
('16', 209, 0, 1, 476927) 210 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 209, 1, 2, 476969) an opportunity of inviting him and your readers to help me in my onerous mission.
('16', 209, 1, 3, 477051) The mission may fail to prevent cow slaughter.
('16', 209, 1, 4, 477098) But there is no reason why by patient plodding and consistent practice it should not succeed in showing the folly, the stupidity and the inhumanity of committing the crime of killing a fellow human being for the sake of saving a fellow animal.
('16', 209, 1, 5, 477342) So much on behalf of the innocent cow.
('16', 209, 1, 6, 477381) A word only for my innocent wife who will never even know the wrong your correspondent has done her.
('16', 209, 1, 7, 477482) If Mr. Irwin would enjoy the honour of being introduced to her he will soon find out that Mrs. Gandhi is a simple woman, almost unlettered, who knows nothing of the two bazaars mentioned by him, even as I knew nothing of them until very recently and some time after the establishment of the rival bazaar referred to by Mr. Irwin.
('16', 209, 1, 8, 477812) He will then further assure himself that Mrs. Gandhi has had no hand in its establishment and is totally incapable of managing such a bazaar.
('16', 209, 1, 9, 477954) Lastly, he will at once learn that Mrs. Gandhi’s time is occupied in cooking for and serving the teachers conducting the school established in the dehat (interior) in question, in distributing medical relief and in moving amongst the women of the dehat with a view to giving them an idea of simple hygiene.
('16', 209, 1, 10, 478261) Mrs. Gandhi, I may add, has not learnt the art of making speeches or addressing letters to the Press.
('16', 209, 1, 11, 478363) As to the rest of the letters, the less said the better.
('16', 209, 1, 12, 478420) It is so full of palpable misrepresentations that it is difficult to deal with them with sufficient self restraint.
('16', 209, 1, 13, 478536) I can only say that I am trying to the best of my ability to fulfil the obligation I hold myself under, of promoting good will between planters and ryots, and if I fail, it would not be due to want of efforts on my part, but it would be largely, if not entirely, due to the mischievous propaganda Mr. Irwin is carrying on openly and some others sub rosa in Champaran in order to nullify the effect of the report published by the Agrarian Committee, which was brought into being— not as Mr. Irwin falsely suggests at my request—but by the agitation carried on, as your files would demonstrate, by Mr. Irwin and his friends of the Anglo Indian Association.
('16', 209, 1, 14, 479191) If he is wise, he will abide by his written word, voluntarily and after full discussion and deliberation, given by him at Ranchi.
('16', 209, 2, 15, 479321) Yours, etc.,

('16', 210, 2, 3, 479444) MOTIHARI, January 16, 1918
('16', 210, 3, 4, 479471) DEAR MR. RUDRA, 1
('16', 210, 4, 5, 479489) I am dictating this letter to Mr. Desai as, owing to an acute pain in the left side, I am disinclined to do much writing.
('16', 210, 4, 6, 479611) What I want from you, if I can get it, is not a hastily written letter about the vernaculars, but a full, enthusiastic and eloquent plea for them which I can use for rousing the public to a sense of its duty in this matter.
('16', 210, 4, 7, 479835) Why should you have teaching [in] the vernacular and answers in English?
('16', 210, 4, 8, 479908) Why should every lad have to know English?
('16', 210, 4, 9, 479951) Is it not enough if some men are specially trained in English in each Province so that they may diffuse among the nation through the vernaculars a knowledge of new discoveries and researches?
('16', 210, 4, 10, 480143) So doing, our boys and girls will become saturated with the new knowledge and we may expect a rejuvenation such as we have never witnessed during the past sixty years.
('16', 210, 4, 11, 480311) I feel more and more that, if our boys are to assimilate facts of different sciences, they will only do so if they receive their training through the vernaculars.
('16', 210, 4, 12, 480474) No half measures will bring about this much needed reform.
('16', 210, 4, 13, 480533) Until we attain this state of things, I fear that we shall have to let the Englishmen think for us and we must continue slavishly to imitate them.
('16', 210, 4, 14, 480680) No scheme of self government can avert the catastrophe if it does not involve this much needed change.
('16', 210, 4, 15, 480783) If you feel with me, I want your letter expressing the above views in your own language.
('16', 210, 4, 16, 480872) I had a very nice time of it in Calcutta, but not in the Congress pandal.
('16', 210, 4, 17, 480946) 2 It was all outside the pandal.
('16', 210, 4, 18, 480979) I was enraptured to witness the “Post Office” 3 performed by the Poet and his company.
('16', 210, 4, 19, 481066) Even as I dictate this, I seem to hear the exquisitely sweet voice of the Poet and the equally exquisite acting on the part of the sick boy.
('16', 210, 4, 20, 481207) Bengali music has for me a charm all its own.
('16', 210, 4, 21, 481253) I did not have enough of it, but what I did have had a most soothing effect upon my nerves which are otherwise always on trial.
('16', 210, 4, 22, 481381) You will be glad to learn that, at the Social Service Conference, I made full use of my privilege as President and as a lover of so much that is good in the

('16', 211, 1, 3, 481867) It seemed to appreciate my remarks.
('16', 211, 1, 4, 481903) I am sending you a copy of my address which, of course, does not contain the personal appeal mentioned above.
('16', 211, 2, 5, 482013) I have not given you a tenth of my experiences, but Mr. Desai reminds me that I must give you one more.
('16', 211, 2, 6, 482117) I attended a Humanitarian League meeting.
('16', 211, 2, 7, 482159) There, too, I was the President and I felt that I should be untrue to myself and the audience if I did not touch upon the devilish worship going on at the Kalighat.
('16', 211, 2, 8, 482324) I therefore spoke about it without mincing words.
('16', 211, 2, 9, 482374) 2 I was watching the audience while I was speaking.
('16', 211, 2, 10, 482426) I am unable to say whether I made any impression upon it.
('16', 211, 2, 11, 482484) Anyway I eased my conscience by referring to the matter fairly fully.
('16', 211, 2, 12, 482554) If I had sufficient fire in me, I would stand in front of the lane leading to the Ghat and stop every man and woman from blaspheming God in the name of religion.
('16', 211, 3, 13, 482716) I return your letter on the vernaculars to you to refresh your memory.

('16', 211, 7, 18, 482902) January 16, 1918
('16', 211, 8, 19, 482919) MY DEAR MILLIE,
('16', 211, 9, 20, 482935) I hope you have received the two letters written to you during the past fortnight.
('16', 211, 9, 21, 483018) In the one I told you not to worry about the money discrepancy and in the other I gave you a brief account of the Congress.
('16', 211, 9, 22, 483142) Here the planters are doing their utmost to upset the committee’s work.
('16', 211, 9, 23, 483214) They are carrying on a most unscrupulous agitation.
('16', 211, 9, 24, 483266) I believe it was at their instance that a case was brought against one of the workers for rash driving.
('16', 211, 9, 25, 483370) He was unjustly found guilty and has, therefore, by way of protest elected to go to gaol and has become a hero.
('16', 211, 9, 26, 483482) His sentence is fortnight’s imprisonment or Rs. 40 fine.

('16', 212, 1, 2, 483707) You will be glad to hear that I have four women 1 working with me.
('16', 212, 1, 3, 483774) They are all doing good work.
('16', 212, 1, 4, 483804) They go about among the village women, teach them the laws of cleanliness and get hold of their girls.
('16', 212, 1, 5, 483907) We have opened one girl’s school.
('16', 212, 1, 6, 483941) People here are most reluctant to bring their girls out.
('16', 212, 1, 7, 483998) They are distributing also medical relief.
('16', 212, 1, 8, 484041) I know you would love this kind of work.
('16', 212, 1, 9, 484082) But your time is not yet.
('16', 212, 1, 10, 484108) I have my eyes upon you.
('16', 212, 1, 11, 484133) When Waldo and Leon are able to take care of themselves and after you have had a few years of peaceful life together, I should not wonder if you do not feel the call to work among the villagers here.
('16', 212, 1, 12, 484333) If India is to become the seat in the world of a mighty spiritual force, it would need to have international workers in her midst who are fired with spiritual zeal.
('16', 212, 1, 13, 484498) Some of India’s problems are world problems.
('16', 212, 1, 14, 484543) They can be solved in a narrow sectional spirit or from a broad humanitarian standpoint.
('16', 212, 2, 15, 484632) I know you and Henry will rally round the humanitarian flag.
('16', 212, 3, 16, 484693) With love,
('16', 212, 4, 17, 484704) Yours ever, BHAI
('16', 212, 6, 18, 484721) I am sending you a copy of my address on Social Service.
('16', 212, 7, 19, 484778) Please congratulate Waldo on his vegetarian work.
('16', 212, 7, 20, 484828) When is he going to fulfil his promise to write to me?

('16', 213, 12, 17, 485811) Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Vol. I
('16', 213, 13, 18, 485844) 1 The Gujarat Sabha advised the Kheda farmers on January 10 to refrain from paying land revenue.
('16', 213, 13, 19, 485941) This was criticised by the Collector of Kheda district in a statement on January 14: “The Collector has full authority either to recover land revenue or to grant postponement, and I have issued my final orders only after a careful investigation of the crops in the district.
('16', 213, 13, 20, 486216) In some villages of the district, where I felt relief was necessary, I have issued orders giving postponement of a part of the land revenue.
('16', 213, 13, 21, 486357) Land holders must now, therefore, pay up their land revenue and the outstanding taqavi.
('16', 213, 13, 22, 486445) If, nevertheless, anyone influenced by the wrong advice which is being given to them refuses to pay up his land revenue dues, I shall be compelled to take stringent legal measures against him.” This was followed by a statement from the Government of Bombay on January 16, which supported the Collector’s action, questioned the locus standi of the Gujarat Sabha in Ahmedabad in advising the farmers of Kheda, described the issue of such advice as “thoughtless and mischievous” and asserted that the Government would not allow “any intervention in the normal work of the collection of land revenue dues” in the “rich and fertile district”.
('16', 213, 13, 23, 487083) On being telegraphically informed of this statement, Gandhiji sent this telegram to the Sabha.

('16', 214, 3, 4, 487494) DEAR MR. REID, 1
('16', 214, 4, 5, 487511) I did not know whilst I had the privilege of working with you, what it meant for you to be on that Committee.
('16', 214, 4, 6, 487621) I know now what risks you ran.
('16', 214, 4, 7, 487652) I do not offer you my sympathy for I know that you are unaffected by the campaign of calumny Messrs Irwin and Jameson are leading.
('16', 214, 4, 8, 487783) Public men who wish to work honestly can only rely upon the approbation of their own conscience.
('16', 214, 4, 9, 487880) No other certificate is worth anything for them.
('16', 214, 4, 10, 487929) May you have strength to bear the fire through which you are passing.
('16', 214, 4, 11, 487999) I hope you had a nice time in Ceylon.

('16', 214, 10, 17, 488166) JAMNADAS, I have your letter.
('16', 214, 10, 18, 488196) If Meva can stay by herself with me, I can arrange to have her here.
('16', 214, 10, 19, 488265) The Doctor may send her in the company of some reliable person or with you.
('16', 214, 10, 20, 488341) After leaving her here, you can go back.
('16', 214, 10, 21, 488382) There are four ladies working here, Narhari’s wife, Mahadev’s, Anandibai 2 (a widow) and Avantikabai.
('16', 214, 10, 22, 488484) I propose to assign them to different villages.
('16', 214, 10, 23, 488532) Three of them are even now in villages.
('16', 214, 10, 24, 488572) Ba, too, is in a village working among the women there.
('16', 214, 10, 25, 488628) You have suffered long enough from the injury caused by the
('16', 214, 11, 26, 488688) 1 General Secretary, Bihar Planters’ Association and member, Bihar and Orissa Legislative Council; he served on the Champaran Enquiry Committee appointed on June 10, 1917, to go into the Indigo labourers’ question.
('16', 214, 11, 27, 488903) 2 Originally from Mahila Ashram at Poona, she joined the team of social workers in Champaran; later, in February 1918, started teaching in the school at Bhitiharwa.
('16', 215, 0, 1, 489068) 216 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 215, 1, 2, 489110) I hope you are absolutely free from it now.
('16', 215, 1, 3, 489154) Ramdas has purposely joined the tailor’s.
('16', 215, 1, 4, 489196) He wants to earn a little and also have some experience of unpleasant conditions.
('16', 215, 1, 5, 489278) He did not leave in a pique.
('16', 215, 1, 6, 489307) I was pleased that he went.
('16', 215, 1, 7, 489335) He will get seasoned.
('16', 215, 1, 8, 489357) He does not expect and should not expect any monetary help from me.
('16', 215, 1, 9, 489425) The question you have asked arises because of the changes that have taken place in my life.
('16', 215, 1, 10, 489517) If I had been, from the beginning, a poor man with no interest other than in the service of the country, nothing more would have been expected of me.
('16', 215, 1, 11, 489667) I could then have brought up my children according to my ideals, and they, on their part, would have been free, on growing up, to follow a path different from mine.
('16', 215, 1, 12, 489832) In that case, they would expect from me nothing more than my blessings.
('16', 215, 1, 13, 489904) I could have claimed this right if I had always been a poor man; if so, I should be able to claim it even now.
('16', 215, 1, 14, 490015) Parents may change their ideals; when they do, the children should either follow them or gently part company with them.
('16', 215, 1, 15, 490135) Only if this happens can everyone enjoy swaraj.
('16', 215, 2, 16, 490183) When an employer becomes what you have pictured, the employee has the right to leave his service.
('16', 215, 2, 17, 490281) He should only take care that the master is not put into difficulty immediately.
('16', 215, 2, 18, 490362) If the employer becomes an outright brute, the employee may leave his service regardless of what may happen to the master’s business.
('16', 215, 2, 19, 490496) He may also give up service if others under the master behave that way.
('16', 215, 2, 20, 490568) There cannot be, however, one single rule to fit all circumstances.
('16', 215, 2, 21, 490636) One can decide only with reference to a given situation.
('16', 215, 3, 22, 490693) When a Kshatriya has lost all his weapons, he fights with his bare hands and feet and dies fighting.
('16', 215, 3, 23, 490794) On this point, too, one cannot lay down an absolute rule.
('16', 215, 3, 24, 490852) There may be occasions when, losing his weapons, the Kshatriya will surrender and then fight again after securing new ones.
('16', 215, 3, 25, 490976) It is not correct to say that the truth is been discovered in the West.
('16', 215, 3, 26, 491048) One is right in holding that truth and non violence are the same thing.
('16', 215, 3, 27, 491120) The one includes the other.
('16', 215, 3, 28, 491148) If anyone vowed to non violence speaks or acts untruth, he will be violating his vow.
('16', 215, 3, 29, 491234) If a man dedicated to truth commits violence, he will sacrifice truth.
('16', 215, 3, 30, 491305) Even if a man refuses to reply, out of fear, he will be violating the vow of non violence.
('16', 215, 3, 31, 491396) If we think of Shri Krishna as the ground of all being and not as a human figure, all doubts will vanish.
('16', 215, 3, 32, 491502) He is an imaginary

('16', 216, 1, 2, 491567) figure, but He has so taken possession of the Hindu heart that He exists in body more truly than we do.
('16', 216, 1, 3, 491671) Of a certainty, Shri Krishna will live as long as Hinduism lives.
('16', 216, 1, 4, 491737) There is much more I can write, but I shall not now.
('16', 216, 1, 5, 491790) Even this I have set down in the midst of difficult circumstances.
('16', 216, 2, 6, 491857) Blessings from
('16', 216, 4, 7, 491872) MEVA, If you have the courage to stay with me by yourself, do come.
('16', 216, 4, 8, 491940) I shall improve your health and you may try to be a daughter to me and so help me to forget the want of one.

('16', 216, 10, 13, 492220) JAMNADAS, I am dictating this letter to you and not writing it myself, for otherwise there may be none at all.
('16', 216, 10, 14, 492331) You are right in what you say about things being dear.
('16', 216, 10, 15, 492386) To keep oneself away from relishing food even while living in daily company with it is a great vow to observe.
('16', 216, 10, 16, 492497) Only an exceptional man can do so and moksha is for such a man alone.
('16', 216, 10, 17, 492567) We may, as yet, only make the attempt.
('16', 216, 10, 18, 492606) Keep the vow as best as you can.
('16', 216, 10, 19, 492639) I think I am myself unworthy at present to speak with any very great authority on this subject.
('16', 216, 10, 20, 492735) Kripalani 1 went to jail the day before yesterday and we observed a fast.
('16', 216, 10, 21, 492809) The joy I knew on that day is not mine today.
('16', 216, 10, 22, 492855) I broke the fast yesterday and had fruits to eat; they were sweet enough, but I ate them without zest and so was full of joy; however, less [than on the previous day].
('16', 216, 10, 23, 493023) I know that, trying to find pleasure in food that is not particularly savoury, I ate too much today and in consequence I am ill at ease in my mind, not happy.
('16', 216, 10, 24, 493182) Thus, despite the fact of my diet being limited to five articles [during

('16', 217, 1, 3, 493513) If, at the age of 49 and despite this effort at discipline, I have not succeeded in bringing my palate fully under control, what may you do, in the prime of youth and living surrounded by all manner of dainties.
('16', 217, 1, 4, 493725) I can guess the answer well enough.
('16', 217, 1, 5, 493761) To be sure, it is my intense desire that you and other young men who have understood the importance of self control in this matter and are endeavouring, in my company, to achieve it, may outdo me.
('16', 217, 1, 6, 493958) You can.
('16', 217, 1, 7, 493967) I have struggled long to attain complete mastery.
('16', 217, 1, 8, 494017) More than this, I shall write when I am worthy enough to do so.
('16', 217, 2, 9, 494081) It is quite likely that earth will have no effect on a deep wound.
('16', 217, 2, 10, 494148) Keep up patiently the treatment you are following, that of inserting a cloth plug.
('16', 217, 2, 11, 494231) If you cannot manage the insertion well, take the Doctor’s help.
('16', 217, 2, 12, 494296) The wound should not remain unhealed for very long now.
('16', 217, 3, 13, 494352) You may put me any questions you like.
('16', 217, 3, 14, 494391) I shall reply when I find the time.

('16', 217, 8, 18, 494578) MOTIHARI , January 18, 1918
('16', 217, 9, 19, 494606) DEAR KALYANBHAI,
('16', 217, 10, 20, 494623) I have your letter.
('16', 217, 10, 21, 494643) I can see only two ways.
('16', 217, 10, 22, 494668) One, the better of the two, is this: the woman should put her education to the right use and try to improve the husband to whom fate has joined her.
('16', 217, 10, 23, 494817) Women have done this before now and, if this one shows such a spirit today, all concerned will soon be happy.
('16', 217, 10, 24, 494927) She must be wise in spirit to succeed in this task.
('16', 217, 10, 25, 494979) If she is not so well equipped, she should make bold and plainly refuse to go and live with her husband.
('16', 217, 10, 26, 495084) If there is reason to fear pressure on her in her parents’ home, she will have every right to leave it.
('16', 217, 10, 27, 495188) In that case, some friend should give her shelter.
('16', 217, 10, 28, 495239) If this cannot be done in a village, she may be removed from there.
('16', 217, 10, 29, 495307) I should like

('16', 218, 5, 7, 495537) [January 18, 1918] 1
('16', 218, 7, 8, 495558) I do not consider Rs.25 all told too much for three months’ expense for you.
('16', 218, 7, 9, 495635) I just wanted to know the figure since it would tell me so many things.
('16', 218, 7, 10, 495707) Even if the money is one’s own, one should keep a detailed account of every kori 2 spent, for the fact is that nothing in this world is our own.
('16', 218, 7, 11, 495852) It is our daily experience that everything belongs to God.
('16', 218, 7, 12, 495911) We should, therefore, be very reasonable in the way we use things and spend our money.
('16', 218, 7, 13, 495998) He who lives in this way would keep for his own satisfaction an account of every pie 3 spent by him.
('16', 218, 7, 14, 496099) If you have not kept the account of Rs. 125 4 in this manner, make it a rule to do so hereafter.
('16', 218, 7, 15, 496196) I remember Devbhabhi kept an account of all money spent just by remembering it.
('16', 218, 8, 16, 496276) If you cannot keep well, you may once again have to run away.
('16', 218, 8, 17, 496338) You may engage a maid servant if you feel that you cannot at all do without such help.

('16', 219, 2, 3, 496909) PATNA, Paush Sud 6 [January 18, 1918] 1
('16', 219, 3, 4, 496949) PRABHUDAS,
('16', 219, 4, 5, 496960) I have your letter.
('16', 219, 4, 6, 496980) Keep up the practice of writing.
('16', 219, 4, 7, 497013) For the present at any rate, your health seems to have improved.
('16', 219, 4, 8, 497078) If you are careful, the improvement will last.
('16', 219, 5, 9, 497125) There is much in the Ashram even without me.
('16', 219, 5, 10, 497170) I should like you to discover it.
('16', 219, 5, 11, 497204) It is an unfortunate position if people feel that there is life in the Ashram only when I am physically present there.
('16', 219, 5, 12, 497323) For, the body is bound to perish sooner or later.
('16', 219, 6, 13, 497373) If you feel the need for the presence of my spirit, it is always present there.
('16', 219, 6, 14, 497453) The more we give up our attachment to the physical presence of the one whom we love, the purer and wider our love becomes.
('16', 219, 6, 15, 497576) If we ourselves cultivate the spirit which we are all trying to create in the Ashram, we would not only not feel a void in the Ashram but the social spirit also would be created so much the earlier.
('16', 219, 7, 16, 497775) Inadvertantly, I have written a letter which will be difficult for you to understand.
('16', 219, 7, 17, 497861) Ask Chhaganlal to explain what you do not understand in it.
('16', 219, 7, 18, 497921) Show it to the others also since it is likely to do good to all.
('16', 219, 7, 19, 497986) Preserve it and read it over and over again and try to understand every word of it.
('16', 219, 7, 20, 498070) The cordial atmosphere which should prevail in the Ashram and among the inmates of the Ashram will then already be created.

('16', 219, 11, 23, 498249) 1 According to a note in the source, the letter was written during the year 1917 18. In both years, however, Gandhiji was not at Patna on Paush Sud 6 as given in the date line.
('16', 219, 11, 24, 498426) On January 18, 1918, which corresponds to Paush Sud 6, he was in Motihari in Bihar.
('16', 219, 11, 25, 498510) He may have mentioned Patna as the place at which Prabhudas should address his reply.

('16', 220, 2, 3, 498673) MOTIHARI, Posh Sud 8 [January 20, 1918]
('16', 220, 3, 4, 498713) MAGANLAL, I am likely to have a battle royal over Mahomed Ali.
('16', 220, 3, 5, 498776) If India carries out my plan, the Government of India will be properly humbled.
('16', 220, 3, 6, 498856) Hindus and Muslims, never united, will become so, mother cow will be safe and we shall hear the triumph of non violence proclaimed all over the world.
('16', 220, 3, 7, 499007) Before all this comes to pass, however, I shall have to go through an ordeal myself.
('16', 220, 3, 8, 499092) A power which has till now brooked opposition from no Indian is sure to fight as if for its very life when defied by a handful of Indians.
('16', 220, 3, 9, 499231) Its fury then will be almost unbearable.
('16', 220, 3, 10, 499272) But I am resolved to face it all.
('16', 220, 3, 11, 499306) I mention this to remind you to be careful that in the storm that will follow we do not lose, whether in our wisdom or folly, the money that we have received for the Ashram.
('16', 220, 3, 12, 499480) I have already told you there should be nothing in my name, at any place.
('16', 220, 3, 13, 499554) Keep everything in your name.
('16', 220, 3, 14, 499584) Transfer everything standing in my name to yours.
('16', 220, 3, 15, 499634) The receipt for the money which Revashankarbhai has deposited in the bank at Bombay is probably in our joint names, his and mine.
('16', 220, 3, 16, 499764) My name in it should be replaced by yours.
('16', 220, 3, 17, 499807) You should make your will to provide against accidents, nominating the Doctor your heir and executor.
('16', 220, 3, 18, 499909) Your plan of work has been chalked out.
('16', 220, 3, 19, 499949) You must devote yourself to weaving and agriculture.
('16', 220, 3, 20, 500002) You should so train Santok 1 that she may join you whole heartedly in this work.
('16', 220, 3, 21, 500083) Simultaneously with this and in order that you may succeed in it, you have to address yourself to the almost superhuman task of moulding Radha 2 and Rukhi 3 to be ideal girls.
('16', 220, 3, 22, 500259) For this, you will need to observe always the highest of dharma.
('16', 220, 3, 23, 500324) Naturally enough, therefore, you will be daily advancing towards moksha, and so in this work your satyagraha and your patriotic services will find their consummation.
('16', 220, 3, 24, 500491) All the money we have is for these two activities and for the National School.
('16', 220, 3, 25, 500570) That will also continue to be the position in law.
('16', 220, 3, 26, 500621) The amounts that will be transferred to your name will not become your property, but will be treated as donations in aid of our activities.

('16', 221, 1, 3, 500902) Consult Shri Krishnalal, Mavlankar and others.
('16', 221, 1, 4, 500949) Drink deep the draught of love from anywhere and everywhere, like that cowherd 1 of Dwarka, no matter even if you have to steal the thing.
('16', 221, 1, 5, 501088) The more you drink of it, the greater will be your bliss and you will have had your heart’s desire.
('16', 221, 1, 6, 501188) If the handloom, which they formerly worked in the pit, had been flourishing today and if we had been spinning all the yarn we require, we would not, with all this cotton available, have to face this terrible rise in the prices of cloth.
('16', 221, 1, 7, 501426) Here people shiver in the cold for want of clothes.
('16', 221, 1, 8, 501478) Every moment I realize the value of cloth.
('16', 221, 1, 9, 501521) Either I have to supply myself with plenty of covering so that I may sleep outside and have oxygen, or for want of such covering suffocate in a box like room, swallowing again my own carbonic acid gas.
('16', 221, 1, 10, 501723) My only prayer, and my blessing as well, is that you may have the necessary strength to realize your aspirations and fulfil my hopes.
('16', 221, 1, 11, 501857) In all that you do, please consult the Ashram inmates and the teachers of the National School.
('16', 221, 1, 12, 501952) I hope to be there at the latest by the 17th or the 18th of February.
('16', 221, 1, 13, 502022) But it occurred to me this morning that I had better write about all this immediately to you.

('16', 221, 7, 20, 502391) 2 Matters so delicate as the one regarding Messrs Ali brothers are least satisfactorily handled by correspondence.
('16', 221, 7, 21, 502506) It would perhaps be better, if you think it advisable, that I should run down to Delhi and first have a chat with you and then, if it is considered necessary, I should wait on His Excellency.

('16', 222, 6, 7, 503027) MESSRS LIENGIER & CO.
('16', 222, 6, 8, 503049) MADURA The method that I have adopted for reinstating those who have left off weaving is to supply them with yarn, at the lowest market rates, to buy out all the cloth they may manufacture, for cash, at the highest market rates, the yarn to be paid for in instalments, without interest, convenient to the weaver.
('16', 222, 6, 9, 503362) This has enabled them to earn at the rate of about Rs. 17 per month.
('16', 222, 6, 10, 503431) These weavers do not give their whole time to weaving and their manufacture is confined to the coarsest cloth.
('16', 222, 6, 11, 503542) They do not want to aspire higher and what they earn is enough for their wants.
('16', 222, 6, 12, 503622) But I know that a clever weaver manufacturing finer counts, with perhaps a little pattern work, can make twenty five rupees per month.
('16', 222, 6, 13, 503757) Every weaver lost to the country is, in my opinion, so much national waste, and every weaver reinstated is so much national gain.
('16', 222, 6, 14, 503887) Whatever the plan you may adopt, I would like you to keep me informed of your activity from time to time.

('16', 222, 10, 19, 504127) DEAR GURUDEV, For my forthcoming address before the Hindi Sammelan 1 at Indore, I am trying to collect the opinions of leaders of thought on the following questions:
('16', 222, 11, 20, 504293) 1 Vide “Speech at Hindi Sahitya Sammelan”, 29 3 1918.
('16', 223, 0, 1, 504347) 224 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 223, 1, 2, 504389) (i) Is not Hindi (as Bhasha 1 or Urdu) the only possible national language for inter provincial intercourse and for all other national proceedings ?
('16', 223, 1, 3, 504538) (ii) Should not Hindi be the language principally used at the forthcoming Congress?
('16', 223, 1, 4, 504622) (iii) Is it not desirable and possible to give the highest teaching in our schools and colleges through the vernaculars?
('16', 223, 1, 5, 504743) And should not Hindi be made a compulsory second language in all our post primary schools?
('16', 223, 1, 6, 504834) I feel that if we are to touch the masses and if national servants are to come in contact with the masses all over India, the questions set forth above have to be immediately solved and ought to be treated as of the utmost urgency.
('16', 223, 1, 7, 505066) Will you kindly favour me with your reply, at your early convenience?

('16', 223, 8, 13, 505287) The question who should write a preface to a volume 3 of my speeches and writings, or whether there should be any preface at all, can be answered after I know the publisher’s name and his motive.
('16', 223, 8, 14, 505483) If the volume is to be brought out by a firm for making profit, it will need a preface by Sarojini 4. If by a pious Vaishnava, to be sure he should approach Ranchhodbhai 5. If a third party, who does not know me, comes across my writings and he wants someone to under write sales, he should seek out a friend, that is Dr. Mehta.

('16', 224, 1, 4, 506425) The desire that, while the sea of my thoughts is yet in tide, as many people as possible should be enabled to have a plunge in it without loss of time, is the only proper motive for bringing out a volume.
('16', 224, 1, 5, 506630) I am, of course, in love with these ideas so that I would naturally desire that the largest number of people be given a chance to read them.
('16', 224, 1, 6, 506771) At present, therefore, I am also one of the sponsors of the plan for publishing a volume.
('16', 224, 1, 7, 506861) Where, then, is the need for a preface?

('16', 224, 5, 18, 507798) 2 Member of Bihar and Orissa Legislative Council.
('16', 224, 5, 19, 507848) He was also on the Select Committee to which the Champaran Agrarian Bill had been referred.
('16', 224, 5, 20, 507940) 3 This was on January 5. Vide Appendix “Memorandum of Bihar Planters’ Association”, 5 1 1918.
('16', 225, 0, 1, 508034) 226 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 225, 1, 2, 508076) be appointed to the Council and should also be on the Select Committee.
('16', 225, 1, 3, 508148) And I feel that nobody is so capable of sufficiently representing these interests as Babu Brajkishore Prasad or myself, and I hope my submission will receive from the Government the attention it deserves.
('16', 225, 1, 4, 508353) In considering the provisions of the Bill, it is, in my humble opinion, of paramount importance for all concerned to remember that the Government have proclaimed to the raiyats their decision upon the Committee’s recommendations.
('16', 225, 1, 5, 508583) 1 It is respectfully suggested that the Bill is in fulfilment of the assurance issued to the raiyats in the said proclamation.
('16', 225, 1, 6, 508710) The Bill, therefore, does not admit of any alteration in any material respect.
('16', 225, 1, 7, 508789) As it is, owing to the acrimonious correspondence going on in the Press and all sorts of rumours set afloat by interested parties, the raiyats are becoming restive.
('16', 225, 1, 8, 508954) Bis dat qui cito dat applies in the present instance with peculiar force.
('16', 225, 1, 9, 509028) Any undue delay in passing the Bill may spell disaster.
('16', 225, 1, 10, 509084) I, therefore, urge that the Bill should be placed on the Statute book of the province as expeditiously as possible.
('16', 225, 1, 11, 509200) Coming to the examination of the papers in question, I shall first take the Champaran Planters’ memorandum.
('16', 225, 1, 12, 509308) Generally speaking, it is a paper containing a series of misrepresentations completely disentitling it to any weight being attached to it.
('16', 225, 1, 13, 509447) The memorandum states that the Agrarian Committee was “admittedly appointed to allay an artificial agitation”.
('16', 225, 1, 14, 509558) The fact is that it was appointed in answer to the agitation set up by the planters in expectation of the raiyats’ agitation being thereby stopped or suppressed.
('16', 225, 1, 15, 509720) I cite in support the following extract from the Pioneer, the leading organ of Anglo Indian opinion in the country.
('16', 225, 1, 16, 509836) In its issue of about the middle of May 1917, it said:
('16', 225, 2, 17, 509891) It appears to us that the Government of Bihar and Orissa would do well forthwith to appoint a commission to investigate the differences which exist between the planters and the raiyats in the Indigo districts.
('16', 225, 2, 18, 510101) It is difficult to see what good can come of Mr. Gandhi’s investigations.
('16', 225, 2, 19, 510175) But an enquiry conducted with strict impartiality by a commission containing possibly a non official element, would give both sides a fair opportunity of stating their case, and ought to result in a lasting peace.
('16', 225, 3, 20, 510389) 1 The orders of the Government were embodied in their resolution of October 18, 1917, which along with the Enquiry Committee Report was published in the Bihar and Orissa Gazette and in local languages for distribution among raiyats.
('16', 226, 0, 1, 510622) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 227
('16', 226, 1, 2, 510668) And by the beginning of June the Government of Bihar and Orissa decided to appoint the Champaran Agrarian Committee.
('16', 226, 1, 3, 510785) On the 8th of June, 1917, the Secretary 1 of the European Association addressed a letter to the Chief Secretary to the Government of Bihar and Orissa saying:
('16', 226, 2, 4, 510943) My Council observe with great satisfaction the decision of your Government to appoint a Committee to enquire and investigate into the relations between landlords and tenants in the Province of Bihar and Orissa.
('16', 226, 3, 5, 511154) The memorandum says that the raiyats’ agitation was, “artificial” and organized outside Champaran.
('16', 226, 3, 6, 511253) The fact is that it was and has been solely confined to Champaran and an agitation in which large masses of men took part could hardly be called an “artificial agitation”.
('16', 226, 3, 7, 511425) The memorandum says “the agitation was in no way the consequence of any widespread grievances”.
('16', 226, 3, 8, 511521) The Government’s own finding and the voluminous papers produced before the Committee by the Government completely contradict this statement.
('16', 226, 3, 9, 511662) It would hardly be dignified for me to notice the many uncalled for and groundless aspersions cast upon the Agrarian Committee.
('16', 226, 3, 10, 511790) I will now take up the various amendments to the provisions of the Bill proposed by the Champaran planters in the memorandum.
('16', 226, 3, 11, 511916) AMENDMENTS TO SECTION 3, CLAUSE (1): Nothing perhaps can surpass in recklessness the statement made in the memorandum that the Bill
('16', 226, 4, 12, 512048) proposes to abolish without compensation and for no adequate reason a system (tinkathia) which has been in existence for over a hundred years.
('16', 226, 5, 13, 512191) Such a statement is made in face of the fact that the Bill is designed to give partial and, in my opinion, inadequate relief from the extortionate compensation taken by the planter for ending a system when it had ceased to become a paying proposition to them.
('16', 226, 5, 14, 512451) One planter has even made a boast in the Press of the fact that he has taken Rs. 3,20,000 from his raiyats as tawan 2 and has made addition to his rent roll of an annual income of Rs. 52,000 by taking sharahbeshi 3. And there are several such planters.
('16', 226, 5, 15, 512704) The whole of the argument advanced in the memorandum
('16', 226, 6, 16, 512757) 1 Alec Marsh 2 Penalty 3 An increase in the rent
('16', 227, 0, 1, 512806) 228 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 227, 1, 2, 512848) about the khushki system simply shows that the signatories desire a modified revival of tinkathia under the name of khushki.
('16', 227, 1, 3, 512973) By khushki I understand a contract voluntarily entered into by the raiyat to supply a particular produce to his landlord for a fair price to be mutually agreed upon.
('16', 227, 1, 4, 513139) Any clause in the contract binding the raiyat to grow a particular crop on the whole or a portion of his land or in a particular plot even selected by himself would immediately rob it of the voluntary nature, and the raiyat is deprived of the right to use his land as he chooses.
('16', 227, 1, 5, 513419) Such a clause would contravene the provisions of Section 23 read with Section 178 (3) (b) of the Bengal Tenancy Act.
('16', 227, 1, 6, 513536) The system of advances has in the past operated as a bait and as a snare.
('16', 227, 1, 7, 513610) A khushki contract should have nothing to do with the land of the raiyat.
('16', 227, 1, 8, 513684) It should only provide for the delivery by the raiyat to the planter of so much of indigo by weight at a rate mutually agreed upon.
('16', 227, 1, 9, 513816) The raiyat may produce the indigo on his own land or purchase it from others or get it from any other source.
('16', 227, 1, 10, 513926) Once his land is brought in the contract, the inevitable result will be that the same sense of obligation with which the growing of indigo has up to now been connected and which it is the desire of the Agrarian Committee and of the Government to remove, in the interest of the future peace of the district, will gradually creep in the mind of the raiyat and will in time overpower him.
('16', 227, 1, 11, 514312) It might be mentioned that the prime concern of the Legislature is not so much the prosperity or even the existence of an industry as the welfare of the raiyats.
('16', 227, 1, 12, 514474) If the raiyat is to be freed entirely from the baneful effects of tinkathia, the khushki system must (a) leave him free to obtain the particular crop he undertakes to supply where he likes and how he likes, his obligation being limited to supply the quantity agreed upon; (b) make the period of khushki contracts as short as possible; and (c) give him the market rate of the produce supplied by him.
('16', 227, 1, 13, 514874) The amendments (b) and (c) to Section 3(1) proposed in the memorandum, as they fail to satisfy the tests set forth above, are wholly unacceptable from the raiyats’ standpoint.
('16', 227, 1, 14, 515050) Coming to the amendment (a) to Section 3(1) proposed in the memorandum extending the period of termination of tinkathia, whether as an incident of tenancy or whether arising from sattas or agreements, to 1920, it is a most dangerous proposition and in breach of the undertaking of the three principal concerns referred to in the Committee’s report.
('16', 227, 1, 15, 515399) The Committee’s recommendation that it should stand abolished as from October 1917 is the one recommendation
('16', 228, 0, 1, 515508) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 229
('16', 228, 1, 2, 515554) which is already being acted upon.
('16', 228, 1, 3, 515589) Acceptance, now, of the proposal of the Champaran planters who have signed the memorandum, would reopen the sore and give rise to unthinkable result[s].
('16', 228, 1, 4, 515742) The proposal is designed virtually to nullify the effects of the Committee’s report and the Govern ment proclamation based thereon.
('16', 228, 1, 5, 515874) The chief reason for continuing the system is said to be that planters have already got seed and made arrangements for the future growing of indigo.
('16', 228, 1, 6, 516023) It must not, however, be forgotten that khushki is at their disposal and they can make use of the seed, machinery and everything under it.
('16', 228, 1, 7, 516162) It is true that real khushki will not give them that hold on the raiyats which the sattas do and will not give them the exorbitant profits, too, that they have hitherto received.
('16', 228, 1, 8, 516341) But they never had a right in equity to any such onesided advantages.
('16', 228, 1, 9, 516411) Consider [it] how we may, it is difficult to find a proper justification for continuing the system.
('16', 228, 1, 10, 516511) As to amendment (d) to Section 3(1) which seeks to continue the obligation until advances are repaid, I am sorry to find that even the Board of Revenue has fallen into the trap.
('16', 228, 1, 11, 516689) A moment’s thought will show that such a continuance may even lead to endless continuation of the obligation, to harassments and to [a] crop of law suits.
('16', 228, 1, 12, 516844) There will be nothing to prevent a planter from never asking a raiyat for a refund of the advance and thus an ignorant raiyat may for ever remain in serfdom.
('16', 228, 1, 13, 517002) I hope it will not be contended that the planter should have security for refund of the advances.
('16', 228, 1, 14, 517100) They do not need it.
('16', 228, 1, 15, 517121) The raiyats are their tenants and they have the fullest hold upon them for any financial obligation, and I cannot help saying that the proposed amendment is merely a device for keeping on foot the pernicious system as long as possible.
('16', 228, 1, 16, 517357) The whole of the soothing effect of the proposed legislation will be practically neutralized if the amendment in question is accepted and [it] will put Champaran in a ferment.
('16', 228, 1, 17, 517533) AMENDMENTS PROPOSED TO SECTION 4 “SHARAHBESHI”: The first amendment to this Section is based on a representation made by the managers of Sirnie Concern.
('16', 228, 1, 18, 517686) But the amendment as it is worded proposes to reopen the question of the rate of reduction to be allowed not only in the case of Sirnie but also of Jalha and Motihari Concerns.
('16', 228, 1, 19, 517863) There is absolutely no reason why the matter should be reopened.
('16', 228, 1, 20, 517928) Mr. Irwin of the Motihari Concern was party to the compromise.
('16', 228, 1, 21, 517991) As to the Sirnie case; I do not know that I am free to interpret the attitude of the Agrarian Committee in the matter.
('16', 228, 1, 22, 518110) I can only say that, without a fresh reference to the Agrarian Committee, it is not possible to go behind
('16', 229, 0, 1, 518216) 230 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 229, 1, 2, 518258) the figures as they are a result of a solemn compromise, not merely as between the Committee and the planters, but also as between the different interests represented on the Committee itself.
('16', 229, 1, 3, 518450) The compromise was one and an indivisible whole and one cannot break a part of it without breaking the whole.
('16', 229, 1, 4, 518560) It is not true as stated in his representation that Mr. Bion 1 was not called to give evidence or given opportunity of having any statements recorded.
('16', 229, 1, 5, 518711) Not only did he come under the general notice issued to all to send in their statements if they wanted to give any evidence, but he had received a special call from the Committee’s report to show that, in fixing the rate of reduction in the enhancements, the sole determining factor was not the rates at which the enhancements were made.
('16', 229, 1, 6, 519049) The reasoning applied to the case is generally applicable to the case of Jalha also.
('16', 229, 1, 7, 519134) AMENDMENT TO SECTION 4(2): There is one point on which it is possible to agree with the Champaran planters’ memorandum.
('16', 229, 1, 8, 519254) That the rental fixed under the Bill should be final and binding is fair; but any amendment that may be made will have to carefully guard the right of appeal on grounds of irregularity and want of jurisdiction.
('16', 229, 1, 9, 519465) SECTION 5 OF THE BILL: I have already sent in my amendment to the effect that the words “grown upon the land of his tenancy or any portion thereof” be omitted from the Section.
('16', 229, 1, 10, 519642) I have explained in the earlier part of this letter, when dealing with tinkathia, why in a khushki contract no reference to the land of the raiyat should be made.
('16', 229, 1, 11, 519805) There are two amendments to this Section proposed by the Champaran planters in the memorandum.
('16', 229, 1, 12, 519900) The first is that the word “three” of Clause (1) should be substituted by the word “five”.
('16', 229, 1, 13, 519991) In other words, it is urged that sattas be limited to five years and not to three years only.
('16', 229, 1, 14, 520085) The fact that even three years are granted is a concession.
('16', 229, 1, 15, 520145) The period of khushki contracts should be as short as possible.
('16', 229, 1, 16, 520209) The memorandum deplores the proposed termination of long term sattas forgetting that not a single planter witness before the Committee has the hardihood to defend long term sattas and some of them went even so far as to say that they did not enforce their sattas.
('16', 229, 1, 17, 520473) Speaking of sugarcane sattas, Mr. Gordon Canning 2 said that “there were sattas entered into when he started sugarcane, but they were not enforced and might be regarded as a dead letter”.

('16', 230, 0, 1, 520719) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 231
('16', 230, 1, 2, 520765) The other suggestion in the memorandum is that the raiyats should infinitely prefer to be paid at a flat rate based on the area of the land in which the specified crop is grown rather than by weight or appraisement.
('16', 230, 1, 3, 520981) This is contrary to my experience.
('16', 230, 1, 4, 521016) The real object, it may be observed, is here too as elsewhere a revival of tinkathia.

('16', 230, 2, 7, 521182) KULKARNI
('16', 230, 3, 8, 521191) [MOTIHARI,] January 24, 1918
('16', 230, 4, 9, 521220) DEAR DR.
('16', 230, 4, 10, 521229) KULKARNI, When I posted my last letter to you, I had read the literature [sent by] you, but for me it was not convincing enough to turn me from my experiment.
('16', 230, 4, 11, 521388) What you say is either true or untrue.
('16', 230, 4, 12, 521427) If salt is the panacea for all evils, no effort should be spared to double or even to quadruple its consumption.
('16', 230, 4, 13, 521540) What I require is statistics showing successful treatment of plague, etc., by the saline method.
('16', 230, 4, 14, 521637) Having read a great deal against the use of salt in books on vegetarianism, I wanted to make the experiment on myself.
('16', 230, 4, 15, 521756) Nearly 7 years ago Mrs. Gandhi was suffering from copious haemorrhage.
('16', 230, 4, 16, 521827) I was treating her with Kuhne baths and a strict dietary.
('16', 230, 4, 17, 521885) When I was almost in despair, I thought of the reasoning applied against salt by Mrs. Wallace and against pulses by Dr. Haig.
('16', 230, 4, 18, 522011) Salt, Dr. Wallace has argued, is an irritant and a stimulant.
('16', 230, 4, 19, 522073) Being inorganic it passes out without being assimilated, but in its passage making a great deal of mischief.
('16', 230, 4, 20, 522182) It unduly excites the salivary glands, irritates the stomach and thus induces men to eat more than they need, and taxing the organs unduly, it impoverishes the blood.
('16', 230, 4, 21, 522349) Both Mrs. Gandhi and I were, like most people, lovers of salt and ate large quantities of it.
('16', 230, 4, 22, 522443) I argued to myself that probably the introduction of salt in the system was responsible for the continuation of her illness.
('16', 230, 4, 23, 522568) I need not enter into the reasoning applied by me to the pulses.
('16', 230, 4, 24, 522633) I was myself at this time
('16', 230, 5, 25, 522659) 1 A week later Gandhiji met W. Maude, Member of the Executive Council, Government of Bihar and Orissa, and had a detailed discussion with him on khuskhi, sharahbeshi and related matters.
('16', 230, 5, 26, 522846) No report of the interview other than a note by Maude is available; vide Appendix “Note on Interview by W. Maude”, 31 1 1918.
('16', 231, 0, 1, 522972) 232 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 231, 1, 2, 523014) ordinarily hale and hearty.
('16', 231, 1, 3, 523042) Certainly no change on the score of health was called for.
('16', 231, 1, 4, 523101) But discovering that I could not wean Mrs. Gandhi from the use of salt and pulses without doing so myself, I left them off and so did she.
('16', 231, 1, 5, 523240) There was no other change made in the treatment.
('16', 231, 1, 6, 523289) Within a week’s time she was free from haemorrhage and she who was, at the time of change, a skeleton quickly put on flesh 1. I have ever since remained without salt.
('16', 231, 1, 7, 523456) The condiment has such a hold upon her that she could not resist the temptation when there was no necessity for it.
('16', 231, 1, 8, 523572) So when she had completely recovered, she took to salt eating.
('16', 231, 1, 9, 523635) She does have haemorrhages now and then, and leaving off salt and taking friction baths enables her to recover quickly.
('16', 231, 1, 10, 523755) During the seven years of my experiments, I have treated asthmatics and patients suffering from other lung diseases with a saltless diet, and they have almost invariably responded.
('16', 231, 1, 11, 523936) As for myself, I have not suffered from serious illnesses any more than those with whom I come in daily contact.
('16', 231, 1, 12, 524049) This saltless diet has, I believe, materially assisted me in my brahmacharya vow.
('16', 231, 1, 13, 524131) With these experiences before me, your persistent advocacy of salt has come upon me with somewhat of a shock.
('16', 231, 1, 14, 524241) There is one great change in me which I have been noticing and which I have discussed with medical friends without getting any light from them.
('16', 231, 1, 15, 524385) If I receive a wound, it heals more quickly than before.
('16', 231, 1, 16, 524442) I experience no feeling of excessive fatigue after long walks.
('16', 231, 1, 17, 524505) But I seem to have become a green stick.
('16', 231, 1, 18, 524546) The skin has become too tender and delicate.
('16', 231, 1, 19, 524591) A knife would tear it, much more quickly than anybody else’s.
('16', 231, 1, 20, 524653) Although I invariably walk barefoot, the soles of my feet refuse to become tough and hard, as would anybody else’s.
('16', 231, 1, 21, 524769) My gums have become flabby and the few teeth I have left are more ornamental than useful.
('16', 231, 1, 22, 524859) Is it possible that this delicateness is a result of a saltless diet ?
('16', 231, 1, 23, 524930) Of course, there are so many other changes that I have made in my life that it is difficult to single out salt for my condemnation.
('16', 231, 1, 24, 525062) If I had not noticed this deterioration in me— if it is a deterioration—I should have, owing to the many other advantages I have experienced, very actively advocated a saltless diet.
('16', 231, 1, 25, 525245) If I received some enlightened assistance from you, I would like, if it be for a temporary period, to go back to salt and watch its results upon my system.
('16', 231, 1, 26, 525401) I was already conferring with Dr. Dev upon the advisability of
('16', 231, 2, 27, 525464) 1 Describing his experiment of a saltless diet and this episode in detail, later, Gandhiji writes: “I would like to count this incident as an instance of satyagraha and it is one of the sweetest recollections of my life.” Vide An Autobiography, Part IV, Ch. XXIX.

('16', 232, 5, 10, 526386) The accused is either guilty or not guilty.
('16', 232, 5, 11, 526430) If the former, he should go to jail by way of penance; if the latter, he should do so by way of a lesson to the magistrate.
('16', 232, 5, 12, 526554) If every accused who is innocent were to go to jail after declaring his innocence, it would come about ultimately that an innocent person would hardly ever find himself in jail.
('16', 232, 5, 13, 526732) So much from the common sense point of view.
('16', 232, 5, 14, 526777) The Professor’s case has several special features.
('16', 232, 5, 15, 526828) His riding a horse too fast was not the reason why it was instituted.
('16', 232, 5, 16, 526898) That merely furnished a pretext.
('16', 232, 5, 17, 526931) The motive behind the case was to discredit me anyhow, and through me the agitation.
('16', 232, 5, 18, 527016) The assumption behind the step was that, though I could not be touched, my enemies would be pleased if others associated with me were.
('16', 232, 5, 19, 527151) At a time like this, it was necessary that the Professor should go to jail and show what he was made of.
('16', 232, 5, 20, 527256) The people here, moreover, are very much afraid of going to jail.
('16', 232, 5, 21, 527322) This was a fine opportunity to rid them of their fear.
('16', 232, 5, 22, 527377) It would not have been right to miss it.
('16', 232, 5, 23, 527418) For the Professor as well to refuse to go through the experience [of imprisonment], which had offered itself to him unsought, would have been to throw away a golden opportunity.
('16', 232, 5, 24, 527596) Satyagraha means fighting injustice by voluntarily submitting oneself to suffering.
('16', 232, 5, 25, 527680) The judgment of the court was naked injustice.
('16', 232, 5, 26, 527727) The Professor, undertaking to suffer by submitting to imprisonment, offered satyagraha.
('16', 232, 5, 27, 527815) It is not for a

('16', 233, 1, 2, 528144) satyagrahi to prefer an appeal.
('16', 233, 1, 3, 528176) There is no room for [legal] defence in pure satyagraha.
('16', 233, 1, 4, 528233) What we see is not pure satyagraha, but its diluted variety.
('16', 233, 1, 5, 528294) Such dilution is a measure and a sign of our weakness.
('16', 233, 1, 6, 528349) When we have pure satyagraha, the world will see its miraculous power.
('16', 233, 1, 7, 528420) I am quite confident of this.
('16', 233, 1, 8, 528450) From this point of view of satyagraha, therefore, there was no question at all of preferring an appeal.
('16', 233, 1, 9, 528554) However, the desire to adhere to pure satyagraha was but a secondary consideration in deciding against an appeal.
('16', 233, 1, 10, 528668) The case was so trivial, as it seemed to me, that we have been able to expose both the partisan spirit and the stupidity of the magistrate by not magnifying its importance through an appeal.
('16', 233, 1, 11, 528859) Moreover, no lawyer came forward to guarantee success in the appeal, if made.
('16', 233, 1, 12, 528937) I suggested to them that they could file one on their own responsibility, telling them also that, if they lost, I would certainly blame them.
('16', 233, 1, 13, 529079) There could be no appeal in this case.
('16', 233, 1, 14, 529118) Revision was possible.
('16', 233, 1, 15, 529141) In a revision, the superior court never goes into questions of fact.
('16', 233, 1, 16, 529210) It only sets matters right if there has been an error of law.
('16', 233, 1, 17, 529272) There was no scope for legal technicalities in this case.
('16', 233, 1, 18, 529330) You will see that, in what we have done, the requirements of both satyagraha and the justice that obtains in what the world calls its practical affairs have been met.

('16', 233, 4, 22, 529602) JAMNADAS, You will gain nothing by giving up your work and staying with me.
('16', 233, 4, 23, 529678) You will yourself get tired in a few days and remember your old duty.
('16', 233, 4, 24, 529748) You should, therefore, find your happiness there.
('16', 233, 4, 25, 529798) At present, your desire to stay with me is a kind of self indulgence.
('16', 233, 4, 26, 529868) Just as, after an act of such indulgence, one feels exhausted and depressed, so just now you will feel depressed after a few days with me.
('16', 233, 4, 27, 530007) You may keep it in mind that one day you will join me and meanwhile, by way of preparation, attend to the duties that devolve upon you.

('16', 234, 3, 5, 530378) The musician has also been drawn into the thing all right.
('16', 234, 3, 6, 530437) You will get the particulars about the Professor in the letter 1 to Kaka.
('16', 234, 3, 7, 530511) If Fakira 2 has, indeed, sent any masons to volunteer their services, that shows that somewhere in the depth of his heart he still has a place for the Ashram.
('16', 234, 3, 8, 530670) Thakorelal’s illness seems to have persisted too long.
('16', 234, 3, 9, 530725) It will be good if Vrajlal keeps as healthy as he will be when he arrives there.
('16', 234, 3, 10, 530806) The indigo planters here are kicking up quite a row.
('16', 234, 3, 11, 530859) I am as unperturbed as I am vigilant.
('16', 234, 3, 12, 530897) All that I have to do is to see that the peasants do not take a false step.
('16', 234, 3, 13, 530973) I will send back Narahari at the earliest opportunity.
('16', 234, 3, 14, 531028) I also feel that the National School must not suffer.

('16', 234, 9, 22, 531331) The reason for handing over the material to Mathuradas is that he may then publish it as he thinks fit.
('16', 234, 9, 23, 531435) English speeches must, of course, be translated.
('16', 234, 9, 24, 531484) He can do this.
('16', 234, 9, 25, 531500) He is eager enough and likes the work.
('16', 234, 9, 26, 531539) He is tempted by the thought that, as he translates, he will discover himself.
('16', 234, 9, 27, 531618) He is a young man of character,

('16', 235, 1, 3, 532106) He has clung to me and has made the request with the most admirable motive.
('16', 235, 1, 4, 532182) For all these various reasons, it seems right that he should be allowed to do this work.
('16', 235, 1, 5, 532271) He has ample time for proof reading, etc.
('16', 235, 1, 6, 532313) Unless you help him, he is like a bird without wings.
('16', 235, 1, 7, 532367) He can collect the material only if we give him the articles.
('16', 235, 1, 8, 532429) He too does not want to be content with translating Natesan’s volume.
('16', 235, 1, 9, 532499) If you are free from this translation work, there is much else you can do.
('16', 235, 1, 10, 532574) There remains now only one thing to consider.
('16', 235, 1, 11, 532620) If you are committed to Akhandanandji and others and they don’t release you, then, Mathuradas will certainly have to be disappointed.
('16', 235, 1, 12, 532754) Even if they publish [the writings], it will be necessary to make some arrangements about proofs.
('16', 235, 1, 13, 532852) I have gone through your list.
('16', 235, 1, 14, 532883) You can expand it considerably, if you care to.
('16', 235, 1, 15, 532931) There are a great many articles of mine in Indian Opinion which I thought very valuable.
('16', 235, 1, 16, 533020) You can make a selection from among them.
('16', 235, 1, 17, 533062) Some of the petitions I drafted in South Africa contain a good amount of history.
('16', 235, 1, 18, 533144) The open letter 1 I addressed in 1894 and the Green Pamphlet 2 which I wrote while here in India are a digest of numerous Blue books.
('16', 235, 1, 19, 533278) The petition 3 about indenture which I drafted in 1894 contains the substance of several Government dispatches on the subject.
('16', 235, 1, 20, 533405) Thus, if you open the trunk of South Africa [papers], you will get plenty of material of every description.
('16', 235, 1, 21, 533513) Anyone who feels tempted to collect it [in a volume] will have not less than six months’ work on his hands.
('16', 235, 1, 22, 533621) If, however, we publish Dharmaniti 4 and other books, that will also make a long list.
('16', 235, 1, 23, 533708) The articles I wrote in England in 1890 91 are also worth including.
('16', 235, 1, 24, 533777) 5 I don’t know where you will find them.
('16', 235, 1, 25, 533818) I have a faint idea that Manilal or Harilal preserved them.

('16', 236, 2, 3, 534464) [MOTIHARI,] January 27, 1918
('16', 236, 3, 4, 534493) BHAISHRI MAVLANKAR, I have your letter about the Sabha’s draft reply to the Press Note on Kaira.
('16', 236, 3, 5, 534590) I like the first part of our reply.
('16', 236, 3, 6, 534626) The second part is as weak [as the first is good].
('16', 236, 3, 7, 534677) I am not bothering to revise it.
('16', 236, 3, 8, 534710) A stronger reply can be given to the Government’s contention that any body outside the Kaira District is not competent to do anything in matters relating to that district.
('16', 236, 3, 9, 534882) Whether or no that district was represented by any member on the Sabha, it is entitled to address the Government concerning any part of Gujarat.
('16', 236, 3, 10, 535027) It is even its duty to do so.
('16', 236, 3, 11, 535057) It was necessary to mention the names of the members of the Inquiry Committee.
('16', 236, 3, 12, 535136) It was not proper to have made a distinction between senior and junior officers; unwittingly, we seem to have admitted that the inquiry would have been more searching and fair if made by senior officers.
('16', 236, 3, 13, 535340) Our contention is that Government officers, from the very fact of being officers, inspire less confidence than experienced citizens who know their responsibility, for the officers are appointed to safeguard the interests of their class and they have a habit of rejecting anything that the people say.
('16', 236, 3, 14, 535641) Public workers, on the other hand, have no interest of their own to serve.
('16', 236, 3, 15, 535716) They are impartial and conscious that an error by them will not be passed over, they are more careful in conducting an inquiry.
('16', 236, 3, 16, 535844) We ought to have brought out all this very effectively.
('16', 236, 3, 17, 535900) In taking up this issue, our purpose is to educate [the people] and to show that we are as anxious for our prestige as the Government is for its.
('16', 236, 3, 18, 536046) The latter often seeks to uphold its prestige by the strength of its authority.
('16', 236, 3, 19, 536126) We should do ours merely by the justice of our actions.
('16', 236, 3, 20, 536182) A training to this end in every detail [of conduct] and a definite lead for the purpose will provide the people an excellent education in swaraj.
('16', 236, 3, 21, 536328) This is why I have concerned myself to offer all this criticism.
('16', 236, 3, 22, 536393) Another thing I should like to say is that, at a moment like this, timely action wins appreciation.
('16', 236, 3, 23, 536493) The Committee must immediately attend to the problem, setting aside all other work, if need be.
('16', 236, 3, 24, 536589) In short, the Committee can in no circumstances put off its duty.
('16', 236, 3, 25, 536655) It should have able members, men of responsibility, who can attend at any time.
('16', 236, 3, 26, 536735) If we are right in our cause, it involves the safeguarding of the interests of thousands of poor people.

('16', 237, 1, 3, 537018) I think we are too late with our reply.
('16', 237, 1, 4, 537058) Often, the Government, just because it is more alert, is able to suppress a popular movement.
('16', 237, 1, 5, 537152) Justice does not help the ones who slumber but helps only those who are vigilant.
('16', 237, 1, 6, 537234) This is not a maxim to be mouthed in courts of law but to be applied in every concern of practical life.
('16', 237, 2, 7, 537339) It is because you are all doing such fine work and are holding out so firmly that I have honoured you with this criticism.
('16', 237, 2, 8, 537462) If I had wanted to suggest that you had been negligent, I would have done so by maintaining silence.
('16', 237, 2, 9, 537563) It is never my practice to waste my time saying anything of the kind in so many words.
('16', 237, 2, 10, 537650) I have said all this in love, that you may be more vigilant in future and that a body like the Sabha, of thirty years’ standing, may gain in stature.

('16', 238, 8, 17, 539182) I have written to him a consoling letter.
('16', 238, 8, 18, 539224) It is difficult for me to be reconciled to his marriage.
('16', 238, 8, 19, 539281) If he can stand a few more years of bachelor life, he will get hardened.
('16', 238, 8, 20, 539354) I have told him that he is to consider himself entirely as a free man and to receive my advice as from a friend.
('16', 238, 8, 21, 539467) You are all just now going through fire.
('16', 238, 8, 22, 539508) May you all come out unburnt.
('16', 238, 8, 23, 539538) Here I am in the midst of three imminent battles of passive resistance; 2 which will ultimately take place, it is difficult to say.

('16', 239, 7, 10, 540189) I hear from Devibehn that you showed yourself unhappy before Sam at being unmarried.
('16', 239, 7, 11, 540274) Please do not allow anything to stand in the way of your telling me what you think.
('16', 239, 7, 12, 540358) You are not my prisoner, but my friend.
('16', 239, 7, 13, 540398) I shall give you my advice honestly; you may think over what I say and then act as it seems best to you.
('16', 239, 7, 14, 540503) I should not like you to do anything sinful out of fear of me.
('16', 239, 7, 15, 540566) I want you not to stand in awe of me or anyone else.
('16', 239, 7, 16, 540619) In my view, you certainly ought not to marry.
('16', 239, 7, 17, 540665) Your welfare lies in not marrying.
('16', 239, 7, 18, 540700) If you find it impossible to continue in your present state, you may come away to India when you are free to leave and think what you should do.
('16', 239, 7, 19, 540845) Evidently, nothing can be done while you are there.
('16', 239, 7, 20, 540897) If you have decided that you should marry, I believe you will get a suitable match.
('16', 239, 7, 21, 540981) I take it that you will not give up your work just in order to get married.
('16', 239, 7, 22, 541057) You may consider marriage only when you can leave Indian Opinion in good order.
('16', 239, 7, 23, 541137) See that you don’t lose your cheerfulness; and don’t indulge in day dreams.
('16', 239, 7, 24, 541213) We have a thousand desires; all of them cannot be satisfied.
('16', 239, 7, 25, 541274) Remember this and be serene.
('16', 239, 7, 26, 541303) Be clear in your mind that whatever you do will be above board and done openly.
('16', 239, 7, 27, 541383) Everything then will be for the best.
('16', 239, 7, 28, 541421) I may have to put up a stiff fight over Mahomed Ali; I have come to no decision, though.

('16', 240, 2, 3, 541652) [PATNA,] January 31, 1918
('16', 240, 3, 4, 541678) I can very well realize the moral dilemma in which you find yourself.
('16', 240, 3, 5, 541748) Damayanti found herself in difficulty only when she was face to face with several persons looking like Nala.
('16', 240, 3, 6, 541857) Real firmness is displayed in a situation of this kind.
('16', 240, 3, 7, 541913) That is no easy matter, however, and hence mistakes on such occasions are pardonable.
('16', 240, 3, 8, 541999) I can see the point in our collecting a hundred thousand rupees and paying the revenues from the amount, but the effort will have no effect on the Government.
('16', 240, 3, 9, 542158) I don’t see how our paying up the dues on behalf of the farmers can ever worry the Government.
('16', 240, 3, 10, 542253) On the other hand, auctioning their cattle will be a jaw breaking undertaking.
('16', 240, 3, 11, 542332) The purpose of satyagraha is not to save our face but to instil courage into the people and make them independent in spirit.
('16', 240, 3, 12, 542457) If, because of fear, or distrust of us, people lose heart and pay up, they but deserve to pay [compulsorily].
('16', 240, 3, 13, 542567) We, on our part, should exert ourselves still more to be worthy of their trust.
('16', 240, 3, 14, 542647) This is the royal road of satyagraha.
('16', 240, 3, 15, 542685) If I had a hundred thousand rupees, I would go from house to house telling people to let their cattle be auctioned, but not to borrow money to pay up the revenue dues.
('16', 240, 3, 16, 542853) At the auction I would use the money to bid for the people’s cattle and, in due time, return them to the owners who would have held out through a difficult time.
('16', 240, 3, 17, 543015) I would not tell the people that I intended to see their cattle safe.
('16', 240, 3, 18, 543085) As things are, if everything goes all right, the Government will practically have to apologize.
('16', 240, 3, 19, 543181) All this will appear as wisdom after the event and hence of little value.
('16', 240, 3, 20, 543255) Do what you think the situation demands from time to time.
('16', 240, 3, 21, 543314) I have the invaluable opportunity of watching your work from a distance and you, on your part, are discovering that no one in this world is indispensable.

('16', 241, 6, 11, 543946) PRABHUDAS, There is much in the Ashram even when I am not there; I should like you to discover it.
('16', 241, 6, 12, 544045) It would be a sad state of affairs, indeed, if it were my physical presence alone which lent the Ashram its life, for the mere body is bound to perish.
('16', 241, 6, 13, 544197) The soul is always there, if only you can feel its presence.
('16', 241, 6, 14, 544258) If we love anyone, the more indifferent we become to his physical presence the purer will be our love for him.
('16', 241, 6, 15, 544369) The Ashram will not seem lonely if we cultivate in ourselves the spirit that we all strive to create in the atmosphere there; in fact, the community spirit will grow the sooner if we do this.
('16', 241, 6, 16, 544561) Without meaning to, I have written a letter rather beyond you.
('16', 241, 6, 17, 544624) Ask Chi.

('16', 241, 6, 20, 544756) Preserve it and read it over and over again so that you fully understand every word of it.

('16', 242, 9, 15, 545724) February 4, 1918
('16', 242, 10, 16, 545741) I do not want to say much.
('16', 242, 10, 17, 545768) I have received a letter asking me to be present at tomorrow’s deputation 3 that is going to wait on His Excellency the Governor, and I am sure I will be able to explain to him the true facts.
('16', 242, 10, 18, 545961) Still, I must make it clear here that the responsibility of the notice 4 issued by the Gujarat Sabha lies on me.
('16', 242, 10, 19, 546074) I was at Ahmedabad before that notice was issued, where the matter of Kheda district was being discussed, when it was decided that the
('16', 242, 11, 20, 546209) 1 This was Gandhiji’s comment on being informed that Kasturba Gandhi had been enrolled as a member of the All India Women’s Association; vide “Fragment of Letter to Mrs. Jinarajadas”?
('16', 242, 11, 21, 546393) before 10 2 1918 2 The public meeting, largely attended by merchants and traders, was held at the Moolji Jetha Market.
('16', 242, 11, 22, 546512) Jamnadas Dwarkadas presided.
('16', 242, 11, 23, 546541) 3 This consisted of Vithalbhai Patel, Dinshah Wacha and Gokuldas Parekh, besides Gandhiji.
('16', 242, 11, 24, 546632) No report of the discussion is available.
('16', 242, 11, 25, 546674) 4 The notice, circulated among the farmers of Kheda district on January 10, had advised them to refrain from paying land revenue.
('16', 243, 0, 1, 546804) 244 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 243, 1, 2, 546846) Gujarat Sabha ought to take part in the matter.
('16', 243, 1, 3, 546894) I think that, as regards this notice, a mountain has been made out of a molehill.
('16', 243, 1, 4, 546976) Everyone knew what the notice was when it was being framed.
('16', 243, 1, 5, 547036) Nobody then even dreamt that Government would misinterpret it.
('16', 243, 1, 6, 547099) The Sabha had with it sufficient data about the plight of the people.
('16', 243, 1, 7, 547169) They came to know that Government officials were collecting taxes and the people were even selling their cattle to pay the taxes.
('16', 243, 1, 8, 547299) The matter had come to such a pass, and, knowing this, the Sabha thought it better to issue a notice to console the people who braved these hardships.
('16', 243, 1, 9, 547450) And the notice was the result of that information, and I have every hope that, in the deputation that is going to wait on the Governor, the result of the deliberations will end in the success of the people.
('16', 243, 1, 10, 547657) If the Commissioner had not been angry with us, and had talked politely with the deputation that waited on him, and had not misinstructed the Bombay Government, such a grave crisis would not have eventuated, and we would not have had the trouble of meeting here this evening.
('16', 243, 1, 11, 547933) The Sabha’s request was to suspend the collection of dues till the negotiations were over.
('16', 243, 1, 12, 548024) But Government did not take this proper course and issued an angry Press Note.
('16', 243, 1, 13, 548103) It was my firm belief—and even now I firmly believe—that the representatives of the people and Government could have joined together and taken the proper steps.
('16', 243, 1, 14, 548264) I regret to have to say that Government has made a mistake.
('16', 243, 1, 15, 548324) Perhaps subordinate officers of Government would say to Government that the notice was issued not from a pure motive, but from some other ulterior motive.
('16', 243, 1, 16, 548479) If Government are impressed with this erroneous belief, those who have stood by the people, I hope, will continue to stand by them to the end and will not retreat.
('16', 243, 1, 17, 548643) Any responsible right thinking man could have given them the same advice.
('16', 243, 1, 18, 548717) People possess the same rights as the authorities have, and public men have every right to advise the people of their rights.
('16', 243, 1, 19, 548843) The people that do not fight for their rights are like slaves (“Hear, hear”), and such people do not deserve Home Rule.
('16', 243, 1, 20, 548963) 1 When authorities think that they can take anything from the people and can interfere, a difficult situation arises and if such a situation arises, I must plainly say that those who have given the people the right advice will stand by
('16', 243, 2, 21, 549199) 1 According to a report of February 10 in Prajabandhu, a Gujarati daily, Gandhiji here observed: “We should place our demands before the Government, even if we have to suffer in consequence.
('16', 243, 2, 22, 549390) India has followers of four different faiths and members of all of these—Hinduism, Islam, Zoroastrianism and Christianity—will need to employ satyagraha often enough.”

('16', 244, 1, 2, 549604) them till the end.
('16', 244, 1, 3, 549623) I have not yet come to any conclusion, and I sincerely trust that those who understand the responsibility will not hesitate to undergo hardships in order to secure justice.(Applause.) And in such an eventuality I hope you will not beat an ignominious retreat.
('16', 244, 1, 4, 549883) The first and the last principle of passive resistance is that we should not inflict hardships on others, but put up with them ourselves in order to get justice, and Government need not fear anything, if we make up our mind, as we are bent on getting sheer justice from it and nothing else.
('16', 244, 1, 5, 550174) To get that justice we must fight with the authorities, and the people that do not so fight are but slaves.
('16', 244, 1, 6, 550282) We can have only two weapons on occasions like this: revolt or passive resistance, and my request is for the second remedy always.
('16', 244, 1, 7, 550413) The right of suffering hardships, and claiming justice and getting one’s demands is from one’s birth.
('16', 244, 1, 8, 550515) Similarly, we have to get justice at the hands of the Government by suffering hardships.
('16', 244, 1, 9, 550604) We must suffer hardships like brave men.
('16', 244, 1, 10, 550645) What I have to say is: resort to the right means, and that very firmly, in order to remove the distress through which the people of Gujarat are passing.
('16', 244, 1, 11, 550798) It is my conviction that if we tell the truth to the British Government it can ultimately be convinced, and if only we are firm in our resolve, rest assured that Kheda people shall suffer wrongs no more.

('16', 245, 1, 5, 551911) I therefore hope that the Government will not only grant the inquiry suggested by me but that it would be an absolutely independent committee that will conduct the inquiry.

('16', 246, 3, 4, 553751) DEAR MR. PRATT 2,
('16', 246, 4, 5, 553769) I have just been shown a few notices issued under the signature of the Mamlatdar of Kapadvanj Taluka stating that the plots of land referred to therein will be forfeited to the Government, if the parties notified do not pay the dues therein mentioned on or before the 11th instant.
('16', 246, 4, 6, 554051) The notices issued are dated the 2nd instant.
('16', 246, 4, 7, 554097) I have seen most of the parties who appeared to me to be perfectly respectable men fighting for what they consider to be their rights.
('16', 246, 4, 8, 554232) I understand, too, that some of the land referred to in the notices is sanadia land.
('16', 246, 4, 9, 554317) 1 hope that it is not the intention of the Government, whatever may be their ultimate decision, to take extreme and, what may be termed vindictive, measures.
('16', 246, 5, 10, 554475) I have also been shown a circular over the signature of the same Mamlatdar wherein ryots like those mentioned in the notices above referred to [are described] as dandia, meaning, I presume, rascals or loafers.
('16', 246, 5, 11, 554685) In my opinion the language of the circular is undignified and highly offensive.
('16', 246, 5, 12, 554765) I am sure that it is not the Government’s desire that in drafting Gujarati circulars ordinary rules of courtesy may not be observed by officials in charge of such duties.

('16', 247, 2, 3, 555342) February 8, 1918
('16', 247, 3, 4, 555359) You should address a letter to the mill owners about your grievances.
('16', 247, 3, 5, 555429) We do not want any bitterness to grow between the twoparties.
('16', 247, 3, 6, 555491) We cannot all at once demand an increase of 50 to 60 per cent.
('16', 247, 3, 7, 555554) We shall appeal to them with due firmness.
('16', 247, 3, 8, 555597) If, despite that, they do not agree, we will have five persons nominated by each side and accept their decision.
('16', 247, 3, 9, 555710) It will be binding on both sides.
('16', 247, 3, 10, 555744) They are sure to consider our reasonable demands.
('16', 247, 3, 11, 555794) They, too, are Indians, like us and there is no reason, therefore, to give up hope.
('16', 247, 3, 12, 555878) You should follow the path of justice and seek a solution without bitterness.
('16', 247, 3, 13, 555956) This will make your case all the stronger.
('16', 247, 3, 14, 555999) Anasuyabehn lives only for you.
('16', 247, 3, 15, 556031) With increased earnings as demanded by you, you should learn to be clean, should get rid of your various addictions and see that your children get education.
('16', 247, 3, 16, 556189) Place your just demands before your employers without fear.
('16', 247, 3, 17, 556249) I want to help you in all this as much as I can.

('16', 247, 8, 23, 556418) The sentence about Mrs. Gandhi’s signature in English was unhappily worded.
('16', 247, 8, 24, 556494) The complete thought has not been given in it.
('16', 247, 8, 25, 556541) Mrs. Gandhi is not educated in any sense of the term.
('16', 247, 8, 26, 556595) She can hardly read and write Gujarati.
('16', 247, 8, 27, 556635) That she cannot even sign her name in English was intended to convey to those who prize English education the full measure of Mrs. Gandhi’s unfitness to become a member of
('16', 247, 9, 28, 556807) 1 Gandhiji had gone to Bombay in connection with the Kheda situation.
('16', 247, 9, 29, 556877) There he met Ambalal Sarabhai, the Ahmedabad mill owner, who told him of the discontent among mill hands over the issue of bonus.
('16', 247, 9, 30, 557007) Sarabhai requested Gandhiji to intervene.
('16', 247, 9, 31, 557049) Gandhiji went to Ahmedabad and studied the problem first hand.
('16', 247, 9, 32, 557112) The workers apprehended great hardship from an abrupt stoppage of the plague bonus and were demanding a dearness increase of 50 per cent in its place.
('16', 247, 9, 33, 557263) This was, perhaps, the first meeting of mill hands that Gandhiji addressed.
('16', 247, 9, 34, 557339) 2 The letter was Gandhiji’s rejoinder to the addressee’s gentle rebuke for his letter to her dated February 2; vide “Letter to Someone in Ranchi”, 2 2 1918.

('16', 249, 2, 3, 559038) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, February 15, 1918
('16', 249, 3, 4, 559079) DEAR MR. PRATT, We were not able on Wednesday last to resume discussion of my complaint about unbecoming language used in Gujarati circulars.
('16', 249, 3, 5, 559221) l enclose copy of a public notice dated the 14th January over the Collector’s signature.
('16', 249, 3, 6, 559310) I have underlined what I have ventured to term undignified and offensive.
('16', 249, 3, 7, 559384) The underlined portion insults both the Secretaries 1 and those who have accepted their advice.
('16', 249, 3, 8, 559480) As I told you I do not think that the Collector had intended to use expressions which in the Gujarati language could not be used about respectable men.
('16', 249, 3, 9, 559632) You will find herewith enclosed a copy of a circular over the Mamlatdar’s signature.
('16', 249, 3, 10, 559717) I venture to suggest that the language of this circular is open to grave objection.
('16', 249, 3, 11, 559801) As to the anti dairy activity, I enclose herewith the circular which is being printed specially for distribution.
('16', 249, 3, 12, 559915) You will notice that it covers the whole ground.
('16', 249, 3, 13, 559964) There is a slight misunderstanding in your letter.
('16', 249, 3, 14, 560015) I have not confined my attention to the milk supply to the infants of the sellers only, but my attention extends to the public at large.
('16', 249, 3, 15, 560152) In my opinion milk supplied to the dairies is so much milk taken away from the infants’ mouths.
('16', 249, 3, 16, 560248) Could you give me some details as to the coercion alleged to have been used by some people against milk sellers intending to deal with the dairies?
('16', 249, 3, 17, 560396) If I knew the villages and perhaps the names of the offenders 1 would try to reach them.
('16', 249, 3, 18, 560485) As for the forfeiture notices 1 would venture to say this.
('16', 249, 3, 19, 560544) To confiscate land worth several thousand rupees’ assessment is, in my opinion, a punishment out of all proportion to the default and can therefore only be termed vindictive.
('16', 249, 3, 20, 560719) I observe that more such notices have been issued.
('16', 249, 3, 21, 560770) I hope they will be withdrawn 2.

('16', 250, 2, 3, 561302) [SABARMATI, After February 10, 1918] I do not know in what terms to praise you.
('16', 250, 2, 4, 561382) Your love and your character fascinate me and so also your self examination.
('16', 250, 2, 5, 561459) I am not fit to measure your worth.
('16', 250, 2, 6, 561495) I accept your own estimate and assume the position of a father to you.
('16', 250, 2, 7, 561566) You seem almost to have met a long felt wish of mine.
('16', 250, 2, 8, 561620) In my view a father is, in fact, a father only when he has a son who surpasses him in virtue.
('16', 250, 2, 9, 561714) A real son, likewise, is one who improves on what the father has done; if the father is truthful, firm of mind and compassionate, the son will be all this in a greater measure.
('16', 250, 2, 10, 561891) This is what you have made yourself.
('16', 250, 2, 11, 561928) I don’t see that you owe your achievement to any effort of mine.
('16', 250, 2, 12, 561993) Hence, I accept the role you offer to me as a gift of love.
('16', 250, 2, 13, 562053) I shall strive to be worthy of it; and, if ever I become another Hiranyakashipu, oppose me respectfully as Prahlad, who loved God, disobeyed him.
('16', 250, 2, 14, 562199) It is true as you say that, though outside the Ashram, you have scrupulously observed its rules.
('16', 250, 2, 15, 562296) I never doubted that you would return.
('16', 250, 2, 16, 562335) Besides, I had your written messages, read out by Mama.
('16', 250, 2, 17, 562391) May God grant you long life, and use you for the uplift of India.
('16', 250, 2, 18, 562457) I don’t see any need for changes in your diet just yet.
('16', 250, 2, 19, 562513) Do not give up milk for the present.
('16', 250, 2, 20, 562550) On the contrary, increase the quantity, if necessary.
('16', 250, 2, 21, 562604) About the railways, no satyagraha is required.
('16', 250, 2, 22, 562651) What is wanted is intelligent workers to carry on propaganda.
('16', 250, 2, 23, 562713) On the issue in Kheda District, satyagraha may possibly have to be offered.
('16', 250, 2, 24, 562789) I am something of a tramp these days.
('16', 250, 2, 25, 562827) In a day or two, I shall have to leave for Delhi.
('16', 250, 2, 26, 562877) More when you arrive.
('16', 250, 2, 27, 562899) Everyone is looking forward to seeing you.

('16', 250, 4, 29, 563007) 1 On reading Vinoba Bhave’s letter explaining why he had not returned to the Ashram for a whole year, Gandhiji remarked: “So Gorakha [the disciple] has gone one better than Machchhindra [the master].
('16', 250, 4, 30, 563207) He is a Bhima indeed”, and dictated this letter.

('16', 250, 4, 32, 563363) I have always felt that I am fortunate in my dealings with Maharashtrians and Madrasis.
('16', 250, 4, 33, 563451) Of the latter, there is none now.

('16', 251, 9, 14, 564211) Your not being with me has given me a wound that will never heal.

('16', 251, 9, 18, 564419) I have a standing complaint against you.
('16', 251, 9, 19, 564460) You do not give me an opportunity to claim, with pride, that even my sister is helping me in my work.
('16', 251, 9, 20, 564562) Even if I should write, I could only pour out my grief and twit you as I am doing now.
('16', 251, 9, 21, 564649) That is one reason why I put off writing.

('16', 251, 9, 29, 564986) In these circumstances, there is only one thing I can say.
('16', 251, 9, 30, 565045) I don’t live in greater comfort than you do and so your hardships don’t seem unbearable to me.
('16', 251, 9, 31, 565140) I am not in the least ashamed that you have to find the extra money you need by grinding corn for others.
('16', 251, 9, 32, 565246) I only pray, if you have any compassion in you, that you come over and live with me and join

('16', 253, 8, 12, 567409) It would serve no purpose to hurt you by using strong words.
('16', 253, 8, 13, 567470) There are quite a few men who speak of their weaknesses as though they were their virtues.
('16', 253, 8, 14, 567561) You are one such.
('16', 253, 8, 15, 567579) It might be claimed that you take part in public life because you have some exceptional gift, but, in your actions, you show yourself weaker than others.
('16', 253, 8, 16, 567733) You made it out that you had been deeply grieved for your former wife, that her dying words had had a profound effect on you.
('16', 253, 8, 17, 567859) Then you forgot all about the wound, and the effect of the dying words faded into nothingness.
('16', 253, 8, 18, 567954) If a man crying in extreme pain had suddenly started laughing aloud he would be considered either an actor or a lunatic.
('16', 253, 8, 19, 568075) You, who were crying yesterday, are all smiles today.
('16', 253, 8, 20, 568129) What epithet can describe you?
('16', 253, 8, 21, 568160) A man whose desires are not under his control, who is incapable of the least self discipline, is such a man fit to be in public life?
('16', 253, 8, 22, 568294) Do not answer back that you are better than many others one comes across in public life and thus sink lower than you have already done.
('16', 253, 8, 23, 568430) The step you have taken has an important bearing on social reform among Hindus.
('16', 253, 8, 24, 568510) It is more needful that widowers show some sense of decency than that widows should remarry.
('16', 253, 8, 25, 568603) You have violated

('16', 254, 1, 2, 568667) the most fundamental principle.
('16', 254, 1, 3, 568699) If a Gujarat Sevamandal comes to be formed and I am 1 required to have close association with it, it would be very difficult for me to decide whether you could be admitted to it or not.
('16', 254, 1, 4, 568885) God forbid I should judge you—it is for Him alone to judge— but I would not give up my right to decide who shall be my associates in my life’s work.
('16', 254, 1, 5, 569034) You have let the world know what kind of a wound it was that your former wife’s death had inflicted on you.
('16', 254, 1, 6, 569142) Your action has struck me like a thunderbolt.
('16', 254, 1, 7, 569188) May God save you and grant you good sense.

('16', 254, 3, 9, 569292) 154. LETTER TO A. H. WEST
('16', 254, 4, 10, 569318) [SABARMATI,] February 13, 1918
('16', 254, 5, 11, 569349) MY DEAR WEST, I hope you have received all my letters.
('16', 254, 5, 12, 569404) I have your two letters to acknowledge.
('16', 254, 5, 13, 569444) I do not really know what to say.
('16', 254, 5, 14, 569478) I have read Ritch’s and Debeer’s letters.
('16', 254, 5, 15, 569520) From their standpoint they are right.
('16', 254, 5, 16, 569558) For me, you would better serve the work by being a good agriculturist.
('16', 254, 5, 17, 569629) Manilal’s advice from Johannesburg does not appeal to me.
('16', 254, 5, 18, 569687) He ought to be in Phoenix to manage the Gujarati portion.
('16', 254, 5, 19, 569745) 2 But, as I have said, you are the final arbiter and you should do what you think is best.
('16', 254, 5, 20, 569836) So far as I am concerned the property is as much yours as mine, and so is the cause.
('16', 254, 5, 21, 569921) Having said so much about Phoenix, I would like to speak to you about my activities here.
('16', 254, 5, 22, 570011) The very fact that I write so little to you shows how busy I must be here.
('16', 254, 5, 23, 570086) I think everybody wonders at my output of work.
('16', 254, 5, 24, 570134) And nothing is of my seeking.
('16', 254, 5, 25, 570164) I have taken up activities as they have come to me.
('16', 254, 5, 26, 570216) In Bihar, besides watching the legislative activity, I am opening and managing schools.
('16', 254, 5, 27, 570304) The teachers are as a rule married people.
('16', 254, 5, 28, 570347) And both husband and wife work.
('16', 254, 5, 29, 570379) We teach the village children, give the men lessons in hygiene and sanitation and see the village women, persuade them to break through the purdah and send their girls to our schools.
('16', 254, 5, 30, 570563) And we give medical
('16', 254, 6, 31, 570583) 1 The source has “ you are”, which is an error.
('16', 254, 6, 32, 570631) 2 The reference, evidently, is to Indian Opinion.

('16', 255, 1, 2, 570723) relief free of charge.
('16', 255, 1, 3, 570746) Diseases are known and so are remedies.
('16', 255, 1, 4, 570786) We, therefore, do not hesitate to entrust the work to untrained men and women provided they are reliable.
('16', 255, 1, 5, 570892) For instance, Mrs. Gandhi is working at one such school and she freely distributes medicine.
('16', 255, 1, 6, 570985) We have, perhaps, by this time relieved 3,000 malaria patients.
('16', 255, 1, 7, 571049) We clean village wells and village roads and thus enlist villagers’ active co operation.
('16', 255, 1, 8, 571138) Three such schools have been opened and they train over 250 boys and girls under 12 years.
('16', 255, 1, 9, 571229) The teachers are volunteers.
('16', 255, 1, 10, 571258) Then there is the work in Gujarat.
('16', 255, 1, 11, 571293) It consists in carrying out the programme set forth in the Godhra and Broach addresses.
('16', 255, 1, 12, 571381) 1 At the present moment I am trying to deal with imminent passive resistance.
('16', 255, 1, 13, 571459) The activities in Gujarat are multifarious.
('16', 255, 1, 14, 571503) Lastly, I am endeavouring to lead the movement for the release of the Ali Brothers.
('16', 255, 1, 15, 571587) I am working on a programme for dealing with cow protection, sanitation, national system of education, hand weaving and acceptance of Hindi as the lingua franca of India.
('16', 255, 1, 16, 571758) Of course, the Ashram and the national school continue.
('16', 255, 1, 17, 571814) In all this it is my good fortune to be well assisted.
('16', 255, 1, 18, 571869) This activity involves a great deal of travelling.
('16', 255, 1, 19, 571920) The Ashram is beautifully situated on the banks of the Sabarmati river.
('16', 255, 1, 20, 571992) We daily bathe in it.
('16', 255, 1, 21, 572014) All the children can swim now.
('16', 255, 1, 22, 572045) The school is under an able Principal 2 who was a distinguished professor of the Gujarat College.
('16', 255, 1, 23, 572143) The Ashram, of course, is under Maganlal’s management.
('16', 255, 1, 24, 572198) I do not know what is in store for the Ashram or the school.
('16', 255, 1, 25, 572259) They are at the present moment popular institutions.
('16', 255, 1, 26, 572312) In all these activities I often wish for the co operation of fellow workers there.
('16', 255, 1, 27, 572395) But I know it cannot be.
('16', 255, 1, 28, 572420) But, believe me, there is not a moment I do not think of one or the other of you.
('16', 255, 1, 29, 572502) Many of your exploits serve as apt illustrations for me.
('16', 255, 1, 30, 572559) I am building on the experience gained there.
('16', 255, 1, 31, 572605) Please tell Mrs. West that she should not consider for one moment that I have forgotten her or granny.
('16', 255, 1, 32, 572708) Nor have I forgotten the assurances given by me.
('16', 255, 1, 33, 572757) New ties and new acquaintances cannot make me forget old ones.

('16', 256, 7, 12, 573367) MY DEAR PARVATHY 1,
('16', 256, 8, 13, 573387) You see I began your letter in Gujarati as I rarely write [in] English to girls and boys.
('16', 256, 8, 14, 573477) But I know I must write to you in English.
('16', 256, 8, 15, 573520) You will say, ‘If you had provided for my Gujarati or Hindi tuition, I would also have understood your Gujarati and Hindi letters!’ You would be right if you said so.
('16', 256, 8, 16, 573687) I would however say, ‘If you had only gone with me or followed me to India, you would have been truly my daughter and learnt Hindi and Gujarati.’
('16', 256, 9, 17, 573833) Please tell Sam that I expect him to make of Phoenix an agricultural success.
('16', 256, 9, 18, 573911) Do please write to me all about your doings there.
('16', 256, 9, 19, 573962) Radha and Rukhi have grown wonderfully.
('16', 256, 9, 20, 574002) Rukhi looks almost as big as Radha.
('16', 256, 9, 21, 574038) They have both made considerable progress in their tuition.
('16', 256, 9, 22, 574098) With love to you all,

('16', 257, 2, 3, 574380) SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM, SABARMATI, February 15, 1918
('16', 257, 3, 4, 574428) DEAR MR. PRATT,
('16', 257, 4, 5, 574444) After the most mature deliberation, I have come to the conclusion that I dare not leave Gujarat without satisfying myself personally as to the truth or otherwise of the statements made about the failure of crops in a large part of Kaira.
('16', 257, 4, 6, 574682) I have, therefore, decided not to leave Gujarat for the time being, and I am proceeding by the one o’clock train today to Nadiad with a party of co workers.
('16', 257, 4, 7, 574839) I must confess that convincing proof has not been produced before you to warrant suspension on the scale asked for, but so far as I am aware both Messrs.
('16', 257, 4, 8, 574993) Parekh and Company and Deodhar 1 and Company believe that though they have not been able to stand the fire of cross examination, the truth is on their side.
('16', 257, 4, 9, 575150) Only they have not succeeded in producing convincing proof.
('16', 257, 4, 10, 575210) I think it is the experience of most of us that there are some facts we know, though we cannot prove them.
('16', 257, 4, 11, 575317) That has been the position of these friends.
('16', 257, 4, 12, 575362) On the strength of the failure of evidence hitherto produced, His Excellency has thrown on my shoulders the responsibility of removing the impression, which people are labouring under, as to the failure of crops in Kaira.
('16', 257, 4, 13, 575584) But obviously I cannot do so as at present equipped.
('16', 257, 4, 14, 575637) Whilst it is true that the evidence hitherto produced as to failure of crops to such all extent as to warrant supension under the revenue rules, has not been conclusive, it is not possible for me, without conducting a personal investigation, to declare that the popular belief in such failure is wrong.
('16', 257, 4, 15, 575940) This investigation is a duty I owe to the people of Kaira, to the Gujarat Sabha, of which I have the privilege of being the President, and, if I may say so, to the Government.
('16', 257, 4, 16, 576116) I have entered somewhat into details because I am anxious, if I can do so, to assure you that I have absolutely no desire to encourage or produce a useless agitation and that I am proceeding to Kaira purely and simply in search of truth.
('16', 257, 4, 17, 576354) You have agreed that if the people are right they are entitled to relief.
('16', 257, 4, 18, 576428) You very properly declined

('16', 258, 1, 2, 576512) to grant it unless reports of your officials could be successfully challenged.
('16', 258, 1, 3, 576591) And I, on my part, would be shirking a plain duty in spite of the persistent statements made by responsible people to the contrary, if I did not satisfy myself as to their truth or otherwise.
('16', 258, 1, 4, 576783) You will most materially help in allaying the ferment in Kaira, if you could possibly be generous enough to postpone collection pending the result of my self imposed mission.
('16', 258, 2, 5, 576958) And if you think that I may be afforded the usual facilities may I ask you to advise the Collector to help me with information that may be legitimately granted to a public worker.
('16', 258, 2, 6, 577138) I wish also to add that if you desire that any representative of yours should be present while I am inquiring, I have no objection whatsoever.
('16', 258, 2, 7, 577281) I trust you will excuse the length of the communication.
('16', 258, 2, 8, 577338) In reply to the invitation to attend the Durbar on the 26th instant I was obliged to send a reply in the negative in view of my then impending departure for Delhi.
('16', 258, 2, 9, 577502) But in the circumstances now altered, I hope to be able to attend, and pay my respects.

('16', 258, 8, 15, 577732) BHAISHRI .
('16', 258, 8, 16, 577743) , Your letter made painful reading.
('16', 258, 8, 17, 577779) What you say now was not out of your mind when you took the pledge.
('16', 258, 8, 18, 577847) Your duty lay in honouring it, even if your entire family were to starve in consequence.
('16', 258, 8, 19, 577936) Only persons of that stamp can mould a nation.
('16', 258, 8, 20, 577983) Others are just not to be reckoned as men.
('16', 258, 8, 21, 578026) You were under no pressure to take the pledge and you had ample time to think the matter over.

('16', 259, 1, 4, 578721) Even if you should come, you would not be accepted.
('16', 259, 1, 5, 578773) You had better work for your family now.
('16', 259, 1, 6, 578814) Think of the sin you have committed, be all humility and live a quiet life.

('16', 259, 6, 13, 579160) Reading of Amritlal’s death, I was led to think of so many things.
('16', 259, 6, 14, 579227) But a moment ago, Navalram told me that some others of your co workers also died while nursing victims of the plague.
('16', 259, 6, 15, 579345) If such was the manner of their death, there is no reason for grief, only for rejoicing.
('16', 259, 6, 16, 579434) We should welcome such a death for any of us.
('16', 259, 6, 17, 579480) The saying that there is no better death than on the field of battle is apposite in this case.
('16', 259, 6, 18, 579575) The body is bound to perish when it is worn out.
('16', 259, 6, 19, 579624) One may even welcome that.
('16', 259, 6, 20, 579651) Let us, therefore, believe that the spirits of Amritlal, Motilal and their co workers will inhabit new and fitter bodies and serve India when it is their time to do so.
('16', 259, 7, 21, 579820) Give my condolences to Amritlal’s family.
('16', 259, 8, 22, 579862) It will also be a kind of service if you try your best and see that Motilal’s widow is sent over here as early as possible.

('16', 260, 3, 15, 581880) I have entered somewhat into details because I am anxious, if I can do so, to assure you that I have absolutely no desire to encourage or produce a useless agitation and that I am proceeding to Kaira purely and simply in search of truth.
('16', 260, 3, 16, 582118) You have agreed that if the

('16', 261, 1, 2, 582312) people are right they are entitled to relief.
('16', 261, 1, 3, 582358) You very properly declined to grant it unless reports of your officials could be successfully challenged.
('16', 261, 1, 4, 582464) And I, on my part, would be shirking a plain duty in spite of the persistent statements made by responsible people to the contrary, if I did not satisfy myself as to their truth or otherwise.
('16', 261, 1, 5, 582656) You will most materially help in allaying the ferment in Kaira, if you could possibly be generous enough to postpone collection pending the result of my self imposed mission.1 And if you think that I may be afforded the usual facilities may I ask you to advise the Collector to help me with information that may be legitimately granted to a public worker.
('16', 261, 1, 6, 583012) I wish also to add that if you desire that any representative of yours should be present while I am inquiring, I have no objection whatsoever.
('16', 261, 1, 7, 583155) I trust you will excuse the length of the communication.
('16', 261, 1, 8, 583212) In reply to the invitation to attend the Durbar on the 26th instant I was obliged to send a reply in the negative in view of mythen impending departure for Delhi.

('16', 261, 8, 16, 583619) DEAR MR. CRERAR, I have delayed acknowledging your letter of the 9th instant conveying His Excellency’s decision regarding the submission of the Kaira Deputation 2 as before replying I was desirous of learning the result of the interview that Mr. Deodhar and friends had with Mr. Pratt and at which I was also present.
('16', 261, 8, 17, 583938) I now beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter I have sent to Mr. Pratt, which explains what I am doing.
('16', 261, 9, 18, 584043) 1 The addressee in his letter of even date, refused to postpone collection of revenue.

('16', 262, 1, 2, 584226) proceeding to Kaira in order that I may, so far as in me lies, stop the agitation now going on, if I find the statement as to failure to be not warranted by facts, or direct it on what I venture to consider are healthy and uplifting lines, should the statement appear to me to be true.
('16', 262, 1, 3, 584512) l cannot still help feeling that had a public inquiry been granted it would have at once put a stop to all agitation.
('16', 262, 1, 4, 584630) Much the same result is likely to follow if the request made in my letter to Mr. Pratt regarding postponement of collection of the revenue is granted.
('16', 262, 1, 5, 584781) I need hardly repeat the assurance I have given to H. E. that before taking any extreme step I shall seek an interview and place my position before him.

('16', 262, 8, 12, 585131) But I know that you are aware of the atman and am therefore sure that you will at once realize that birth and death are in reality states of the same thing.
('16', 262, 8, 13, 585288) However, it has become part of man’s nature to grieve over a death.
('16', 262, 8, 14, 585356) I want to share your grief in your bereavement.
('16', 262, 8, 15, 585404) Let this give you what solace it can.
('16', 262, 8, 16, 585442) For persons like you who have dedicated themselves to service, there is only one way to mourn a death and that is to dedicate themselves all the more to such service.

('16', 263, 2, 3, 585740) [SABARMATI,] February 16, 1918
('16', 263, 3, 4, 585771) DEVDAS, I came here for a day, but it seems I shall have to stay for about a month.
('16', 263, 3, 5, 585855) I wanted to go to Delhi today; instead, I shall have to go to Nadiad for the Kaira work.
('16', 263, 3, 6, 585944) If I back out now, thousands will be put to heavy loss.
('16', 263, 3, 7, 586000) People will yield and be utterly dispirited.
('16', 263, 3, 8, 586045) The situation being what it is, I have stayed on for the present.
('16', 263, 3, 9, 586111) I am hoping that I shall be able to get away in ten days.
('16', 263, 3, 10, 586169) I keep thinking of you all the time.
('16', 263, 3, 11, 586206) I know you have plenty of zeal and can interest yourself in anything.
('16', 263, 3, 12, 586276) Had you been here, you would have every moment observed the supreme wonder and power of truth.
('16', 263, 3, 13, 586371) This is all the legacy I can leave for you.
('16', 263, 3, 14, 586415) As I believe, it is an inexhaustible legacy.
('16', 263, 3, 15, 586460) For him who knows its worth, it is priceless.
('16', 263, 3, 16, 586506) Such a one would ask to have or desire no other legacy.
('16', 263, 3, 17, 586562) I think you have realized its worth and will cherish it with love.
('16', 263, 3, 18, 586629) I dreamt last night that you betrayed my trust in you, stole currency notes from a safe and changed them.
('16', 263, 3, 19, 586735) You spent the amount on vices.
('16', 263, 3, 20, 586766) I came to know about it.
('16', 263, 3, 21, 586791) I took alarm; felt very miserable.
('16', 263, 3, 22, 586826) Just then I awoke and saw that it was all a dream.
('16', 263, 3, 23, 586877) I thanked God.
('16', 263, 3, 24, 586892) This dream bespeaks my attachment to you.
('16', 263, 3, 25, 586934) You of course want it.
('16', 263, 3, 26, 586957) You need not fear that it will ever disappear altogether during this present life.
('16', 263, 3, 27, 587040) I am making a supreme effort to bear equal love to all but, from you, I do hope for something more [than from others].
('16', 263, 3, 28, 587159) I am not writing separately to Chi.
('16', 263, 3, 29, 587195) Chhotalal and Chi.
('16', 263, 3, 30, 587214) Surendra.
('16', 263, 3, 31, 587224) You may show this to them, if you like, or tell them of it.
('16', 263, 3, 32, 587284) You will have equal reason, though, not to show it to them, on the ground that, as it bears on the sacred relationship of father and son, it had better remain in your exclusive possession.

('16', 264, 2, 3, 587604) NADIAD, [February 17, 1918] 1
('16', 264, 3, 4, 587634) DEAR MR. GHOSAL 2, Mr. Pratt must have informed you that after all I decided to postpone my departure from Ahmedabad for Delhi and to make personal investigation in your District.
('16', 264, 3, 5, 587814) I came in yesterday.
('16', 264, 3, 6, 587835) I went to Wadthal today.
('16', 264, 3, 7, 587860) I observe that three forfeiture notices have been issued there.
('16', 264, 3, 8, 587924) The values of the plots which are described in the forfeiture notices is far in excess of the revenue dues.
('16', 264, 3, 9, 588032) There are two buffaloes also seized in respect of these dues and advertised for sale tomorrow.
('16', 264, 3, 10, 588127) I have advised the men to send in a petition to you in respect of these matters and I hope that the petition has been duly delivered to you and I venture to trust that their prayer as to the postponement of the sale will at least be granted.
('16', 264, 3, 11, 588369) I have got what I consider to be striking proof about the valuation of the crops in Wadthal which I would like, if I may, to discuss with you, and study your own valuation papers, so that I may check and if and when necessary correct myself.
('16', 264, 3, 12, 588611) I shall thank you if you will favour me with an appointment.
('16', 264, 4, 13, 588672) Yours sincerely,

('16', 264, 6, 15, 588742) 164. FOREWORD TO VOLUME OF GOKHALE’S SPEECHES
('16', 264, 7, 16, 588788) [Before February 19, 1918]
('16', 264, 8, 17, 588815) As I was the first to come by the idea of bringing out a translation of the speeches of the late mahatma Gokhale on his death anniversary, it is in a way appropriate that I myself write the foreword to the first volume.
('16', 264, 8, 18, 589035) It is hoped that we will keep on celebrating the Gokhale anniversary.
('16', 264, 8, 19, 589105) Every time to sing devotional songs, make speeches and then disperse is very much of a waste of time with no gain to anyone.
('16', 264, 8, 20, 589230) In order that people may attach more importance to action than to speech making and that they may derive some tangible
('16', 264, 9, 21, 589349) 1From the content it is evident that this letter was written the day after Gandhiji’s arrival at Nadiad to conduct an investigation into the reported failure of crops in the Kheda district.
('16', 264, 9, 22, 589539) Gandhiji reached Nadiad on February 16, 1918. 2 Collector, Kheda District
('16', 265, 0, 1, 589613) 266 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 265, 1, 2, 589655) benefit from the annual celebrations, the organizers of the anniversary resolved last year to publish, on the occasion, a useful book in the mother tongue.
('16', 265, 1, 3, 589811) They decided, at the same time, what book was to be published and, naturally enough, the choice fell on the speeches of the late mahatma.
('16', 265, 1, 4, 589949) It was everyone’s wish that the translation should be an outstanding work in Gujarati literature and that every effort should be made to preserve in the translation the beauty of the holy word of the mahatma as it stands in the original.
('16', 265, 1, 5, 590187) This could not be secured with money but only through voluntary services.
('16', 265, 1, 6, 590261) These we obtained, but, even so, the future alone can say whether the desired result has been achieved.
('16', 265, 1, 7, 590365) The part to which this is a foreword has been translated by Shri Mahadev Haribhai Desai.
('16', 265, 1, 8, 590454) This is no occasion to say anything of him by way of introduction.
('16', 265, 1, 9, 590521) I shall only mention that he is a lover of Gujarati literature.
('16', 265, 1, 10, 590585) He is no stranger to the subject; besides, he is one of the thousands of the late mahatma’s votaries.
('16', 265, 1, 11, 590687) He has carried out his task with great enthusiasm and devotion and one may justifiably hope, therefore, that this translation will earn a place in Gujarati literature.
('16', 265, 1, 12, 590855) During last year’s anniversary celebrations, as soon as the Home Rule League of Bombay learnt that a decision to publish the volume was about to be announced, its secretaries wired an offer of generous help and later sanctioned a big amount, no less than three thousand rupees, for this project; and so the organizing committee had little worry left for collection of funds and its desire to ensure beauty of printing and the general get up was satisfied even in these times of rising prices.
('16', 265, 1, 13, 591348) The Home Rule League deserves congratulations on this large hearted help.
('16', 265, 1, 14, 591422) The foregoing paragraphs are but a foreword to the Foreword.
('16', 265, 1, 15, 591483) In the Foreword itself, one must write something about the departed soul.
('16', 265, 1, 16, 591557) What could a disciple, however, write about his master?
('16', 265, 1, 17, 591613) How could he write it ?
('16', 265, 1, 18, 591637) It would be presumptuous for a disciple to do so.
('16', 265, 1, 19, 591687) The true disciple merges himself in the guru and so can never be a critic of the guru.
('16', 265, 1, 20, 591774) Bhakti or devotion has no eye for shortcomings.
('16', 265, 1, 21, 591822) There can be no cause for complaint if the public do not accept the eulogies of one who refuses to analyse the merits and shortcomings of his subject.
('16', 265, 1, 22, 591973) The disciple’s own actions are, in fact, his commentary on the master.
('16', 265, 1, 23, 592044) I have often said that Gokhale was my political guru.
('16', 265, 1, 24, 592098) That is why I consider myself incapable of writing about him.
('16', 265, 1, 25, 592160) Whatever I write would seem imperfect in my eyes.
('16', 265, 1, 26, 592210) I believe the relationship between the master and the disciple is purely spiritual.
('16', 265, 1, 27, 592294) It is not based on arithmetical calculations.
('16', 265, 1, 28, 592340) The relationship
('16', 266, 0, 1, 592357) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 267
('16', 266, 1, 2, 592403) is formed on the instant, spontaneously, as it were and never snaps once it is formed.
('16', 266, 2, 3, 592490) This relationship of ours was formed in the year 1896. 1 I had no idea of its nature then; nor had he.
('16', 266, 2, 4, 592593) About the same time, I had the good fortune to wait on the master’s master [Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade 2], Lokamanya Tilak, Sir Pherozeshah Mehta 3, Justice Badruddin Tyabji 4, Dr Bhandarkar 5, as also the leaders of Madras and Bengal.
('16', 266, 2, 5, 592832) I was but a raw youth.
('16', 266, 2, 6, 592855) Everyone of them showered his love on me.
('16', 266, 2, 7, 592897) These were among the occasions which I can never forget while I live.
('16', 266, 2, 8, 592967) But the peace of mind which my contacts with Gokhale gave me, those with others did not.
('16', 266, 2, 9, 593056) I do not remember that any special affection was shown to me by Gokhale.
('16', 266, 2, 10, 593129) If I were to measure and compare the love I experienced from them all, I have an impression that no one else showed such love to me as Dr. Bhandarkar did.
('16', 266, 2, 11, 593284) He told me: “I do not take any part in public affairs now.
('16', 266, 2, 12, 593343) But, for your sake I will preside over the public meeting on the issue which you have at heart.” Still, it was only Gokhale who bound me to himself.
('16', 266, 2, 13, 593492) Our new relationship did not take shape immediately.
('16', 266, 2, 14, 593545) But in 1902 6, when I attended the Calcutta Congress, I became fully aware of my being in the position of a disciple.
('16', 266, 2, 15, 593663) Now, again, I had the privilege of meeting almost all the leaders mentioned above.
('16', 266, 2, 16, 593746) I saw that Gokhale had not only not forgotten me but had actually taken me under his charge.
('16', 266, 2, 17, 593839) This had its tangible results.
('16', 266, 2, 18, 593870) He dragged me to his quarters.
('16', 266, 2, 19, 593901) During the Subjects Committee meeting, I felt helpless.
('16', 266, 2, 20, 593957) While the various resolutions were under discussion, I could not, right till the end, gather enough courage to declare that I too had a resolution in my pocket on South Africa.
('16', 266, 2, 21, 594134) It was not to be expected that the night would halt for my sake.
('16', 266, 2, 22, 594199) The leaders were impatient to finish the business on hand.
('16', 266, 2, 23, 594258) I was trembling with the fear that they would rise to leave any moment.
('16', 266, 2, 24, 594330) I could not summon up courage to remind even Gokhale of my business.
('16', 266, 2, 25, 594399) Just then he cried out, “Gandhi has a
('16', 266, 3, 26, 594437) 1 Vide “Speech at Meeting, Madras”, 26 10 1896. 2 1842 1901; eminent judge, reformer, and a founder of the Indian National Congress; vid 3 1845 1915; prominent Indian leader, twice president of the Congress.

('16', 266, 3, 28, 594762) 6 This is evidently a slip; the year was 1901.
('16', 267, 0, 1, 594809) 268 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 267, 1, 2, 594851) resolution on South Africa; we must take it up.” 1 My joy knew no bounds.
('16', 267, 1, 3, 594925) This was my first experience of the Congress and I put great store by resolutions passed by it.
('16', 267, 1, 4, 595021) There is no counting the occasions [of our meeting] that followed, and they are all sacred to me.
('16', 267, 1, 5, 595119) For the present, however, I think I would do well to state what I have believed to be the guiding principle of his life and conclude this Foreword.
('16', 267, 1, 6, 595267) In these difficult and degenerate times, the pure spirit of religion is hardly in evidence anywhere.
('16', 267, 1, 7, 595368) Men who go about the world calling themselves rishi, munis and sadhus rarely show this spirit in themselves.
('16', 267, 1, 8, 595477) Obviously, they have no great treasure of the religious spirit to guard.
('16', 267, 1, 9, 595550) In one beautiful phrase, Narasinha Mehta, best among the lovers of God, has shown in what that spirit consists: Vain, vain all spiritual effort Without meditation on the Self.
('16', 267, 2, 10, 595726) He said this out of his own vast experience.
('16', 267, 2, 11, 595771) It tells us that religion does not necessarily dwell even in the man of great austerities or a great yogi who knows all the procedures of Yoga.
('16', 267, 2, 12, 595915) I have not the least doubt that Gokhale was wise in the truth of the Self.
('16', 267, 2, 13, 595990) He never pretended to observe any religious practice but his life was full of the true spirit of religion.
('16', 267, 2, 14, 596097) Every age is known to have its predominant mode of spiritual effort best suited for the attainment of moksha.
('16', 267, 2, 15, 596207) Whenever the religious spirit is on the decline, it is revived through such an effort in tune with the times.
('16', 267, 2, 16, 596317) In this age, our degradation reveals itself through our political condition.
('16', 267, 2, 17, 596394) Not taking a comprehensive view of things, we run away with the belief that, if but our political conditions improved, we would rise from this fallen state.
('16', 267, 2, 18, 596551) This is only partially true.
('16', 267, 2, 19, 596580) To be sure, we cannot rise again till our political condition changes for the better ; but it is not true that we shall necessarily progress if our political condition undergoes a change, irrespective of the manner in which it is brought about.
('16', 267, 2, 20, 596825) If the means employed are impure, the change will be not in the direction of progress but very likely the opposite.
('16', 267, 2, 21, 596941) Only a change brought about in our political condition by pure means can lead to real progress.
('16', 267, 2, 22, 597037) Gokhale not only perceived this right at the beginning of his public life but also followed the principle in action.

('16', 268, 1, 2, 597323) that popular awakening could be brought about only through political activity.
('16', 268, 1, 3, 597402) If such activity was spiritualized, it could show the path to moksha.
('16', 268, 1, 4, 597472) He placed this great ideal before his Servants of India Society and before the whole nation.
('16', 268, 1, 5, 597565) He firmly declared that, unless our political movement was informed with the spirit of religion, it would be barren.
('16', 268, 1, 6, 597682) The writer who took notice of his death in The Times of India drew particular attention to this aspect of Gokhale’s mission and, doubting if his efforts to create political sannyasis would bear fruit, warned the Servants of India Society, which he left as his legacy, to be vigilant.
('16', 268, 1, 7, 597966) In this age, only political sannyasis can fulfil and adorn the ideal of sannyasa, others will more likely than not disgrace the sannayasi’s saffron garb.
('16', 268, 1, 8, 598120) No Indian who aspires to follow the way of true religion can afford to remain aloof from politics.
('16', 268, 1, 9, 598219) In other words, one who aspires to a truly religious life cannot fail to undertake public service as his mission, and we are today so much caught up in the political machine that service of the people is impossible without taking part in politics.
('16', 268, 1, 10, 598467) In olden days, our peasants, though ignorant of who ruled them, led their simple lives free from fear ; they can no longer afford to be so unconcerned.
('16', 268, 1, 11, 598619) In the circumstances that obtain today, in following the path of religion they must take into account the political conditions.
('16', 268, 1, 12, 598747) If our sadhus, rishis, munis, maulvis and priests realized the truth of this, we would have a Servants of India Society in every village, the spirit of religion would come to prevail all over India, the political system which has become odious would reform itself, India would regain the spiritual empire which, we know it enjoyed in the days gone by, the bonds which hold India under subjection would be severed in an instant, and the ideal state which an ancient seer described in his immortal words would come into being: “Iron would be used not for forging swords but for forging ploughshares, and the lion and the lamb would be friends and live together in love.” Gokhale’s ideal in his life was to labour to bring about this state of affairs.
('16', 268, 1, 13, 599496) That, indeed, is his message and I believe that whoever reads his writings with an open mind will recognize this message in every word of his.

('16', 269, 8, 15, 600216) [February 20, 1918]
('16', 269, 9, 16, 600236) DEAR SISTERS AND BROTHERS OF BHAGINI SAMAJ,
('16', 269, 10, 17, 600280) I am thankful to you for asking me to preside over this annual function of the Samaj.
('16', 269, 10, 18, 600366) Your president, I really feel, should be a woman, though you may seek men’s help or advice in your work.
('16', 269, 10, 19, 600471) The Samaj is dedicated to the noble aim of women’s regeneration and, in the same way that another’s tapascharya does not help one to ascend to heaven, men cannot bring about the regeneration of women.
('16', 269, 10, 20, 600672) I don’t mean to suggest that men do not desire it, or that women would not want to have it through men’s help;
('16', 269, 11, 21, 600783) 1 From Nadiad and Wednesday in the date line as also from the contents; Gandhiji met the Kheda Collector on February 21, 1918 and was at Nadiad the previous day which was a Wednesday.
('16', 269, 11, 22, 600967) Vide “Chronology”.
('16', 269, 11, 23, 600986) 2 Anasuya Sarabhai 3 One word is illegible here.
('16', 269, 11, 24, 601035) 4 Gandhiji presided over the annual gathering of the Bhagini Samaj, a women’s welfare organization of Bombay, held in the Morarji Gokuldas Hall.
('16', 269, 11, 25, 601180) The report of the speech in The Hindu is incomplete; the paragraphs not found in it are supplied here from the Gujarati report in Mahatma Gandhini Vicharsrishti, and marked by an asterisk.
('16', 270, 0, 1, 601369) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 271
('16', 270, 1, 2, 601415) I merely wish to place before you the principle that it is only through self help that an individual or a race can rise.
('16', 270, 1, 3, 601536) This is not a new principle, but we often forget to act upon it.* The Samaj is at present kept going by the enthusiasm of Bhai Karsandas Chitalia.
('16', 270, 1, 4, 601683) I am looking forward to a time when one of you will take his place and release him from this Samaj for other work.
('16', 270, 1, 5, 601798) Having dedicated his life wholly to the service of women, he will find out some work in the same field.
('16', 270, 1, 6, 601902) The Samaj will come into its own when it elects its office bearers from among its women members and gives a better account of itself than it does today.
('16', 270, 1, 7, 602055) I have close associations, as you know, with both men and women, but I find that I can do nothing in the way of service to women without help from women workers.
('16', 270, 1, 8, 602217) That is why I take ever occasion to protest in no uncertain terms that, so long as women in India remain ever so little suppressed or do not have the same rights [as men], India will not make real progress.
('16', 270, 1, 9, 602424) Hence it will be all to India’s honour if this Samaj succeeds completely in its aims.* It is necessary to understand what we mean when we talk of the regeneration of women.
('16', 270, 1, 10, 602597) It presupposes degeneration and, if that is so, we should further consider what led to it and how.
('16', 270, 1, 11, 602696) It is our primary duty to have some very hard thinking on these points.
('16', 270, 1, 12, 602768) In travelling all over India, I have come to realize that all the existing agitation is confined to an infinitesimal section of our people who are really a mere speck in the vast firmament.
('16', 270, 1, 13, 602958) Crores of people of both the sexes live in absolute ignorance of this agitation.
('16', 270, 1, 14, 603039) Full eighty five per cent of the people of this country pass their innocent days in a state of total detachment from what is going on around them.
('16', 270, 1, 15, 603186) These men and women, ignorant as they are, do their bit in life well and properly.
('16', 270, 1, 16, 603269) Both have the same education or, rather, the absence of education, both are helping each other as they ought to do.
('16', 270, 1, 17, 603385) If their lives are in any sense incomplete, the cause can be traced to the incompleteness of the lives of the remaining fifteen per cent.
('16', 270, 1, 18, 603523) If my sisters of the Bhagini Samaj will make a close study of the lives of these 85 per cent of our people, it will provide them ample material for an excellent programme of work for the Samaj.
('16', 270, 1, 19, 603717) In the observations that I am going to make, I will confine myself to the 15 percent above mentioned and, even then, it would be out of place to discuss the disabilities that are common both to men and women.
('16', 270, 1, 20, 603926) The point for us to consider is the
('16', 271, 0, 1, 603962) 272 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 271, 1, 2, 604004) degeneration of our women relatively to our men.
('16', 271, 1, 3, 604053) Legislation has been mostly the handiwork of men; and man has not always been fair and discriminate in performing that self appointed task.
('16', 271, 1, 4, 604193) What the authors of the various smritis have said about women can in no wise be defended.
('16', 271, 1, 5, 604283) Child marriage, the restrictions on widows and such other evils owe their origin to the injunctions in the smritis.
('16', 271, 1, 6, 604399) Women’s being placed on a level with Sudras has done unimaginable harm to Hindu society.
('16', 271, 1, 7, 604488) These statements of mine may have verbal similarity with the occasional attacks of Christians, but, apart from this similarity, there is no other common ground between us.
('16', 271, 1, 8, 604660) The Christians, in their attacks, seek to strike at the roots of Hinduism.
('16', 271, 1, 9, 604735) I look upon myself as an orthodox Hindu and my attack proceeds from the desire to rid Hinduism of its defects and restore it to its pristine glory.
('16', 271, 1, 10, 604883) The Christian critic, by demonstrating the imperfection of the smritis, tries to show that they are just ordinary books.
('16', 271, 1, 11, 605004) My attempt is to show that the imperfection of the smritis comes from interpolated passages, that is to say, verses inserted by persons accepted as smritikaras 1 in the period of our degeneration.
('16', 271, 1, 12, 605201) It is easy to demonstrate the grandeur of the smritis minus these verses.
('16', 271, 1, 13, 605275) I do not have the slightest desire to put up a weak defence of Hinduism, believing out of false pride or in ignorance, and wanting others to believe, that there is no error in the smritis or in the other accepted books of the Hindu religion.
('16', 271, 1, 14, 605517) I am convinced that such an effort will not raise the Hindu religion but will degrade it rather.
('16', 271, 1, 15, 605614) A religion which gives the foremost place to truth can afford no admixture of untruth.* The largest part of our effort in promoting the regeneration of women should be directed towards removing those blemishes which are represented in our shastras as the necessary and ingrained characteristics of women.
('16', 271, 1, 16, 605919) Who will attempt this and how ?
('16', 271, 1, 17, 605951) In my humble opinion, in order to make the attempt we will have to produce women, pure, firm and self controlled as Sita, Damayanti and Draupadi.
('16', 271, 1, 18, 606097) If we do produce them, such modern sisters will receive the same homage from Hindu society as is being paid to their prototypes of yore.
('16', 271, 1, 19, 606234) Their words will have the same authority as the shastras.
('16', 271, 1, 20, 606292) We will feel ashamed of the stray reflections on them in our smritis and will soon forget them.
('16', 271, 1, 21, 606388) Such revolutions have occurred in Hinduism in the past and will still take place in the future, leading to the stability of our faith.
('16', 271, 1, 22, 606523) I pray to God that this Samaj might soon produce such

('16', 272, 0, 1, 606598) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 273
('16', 272, 1, 2, 606644) women as I have described above.
('16', 272, 1, 3, 606677) We have now discussed the root cause of the degeneration of our women and have considered the ideals by the realization of which the present condition of our women can be improved.
('16', 272, 1, 4, 606858) The number of women who can realize those ideals will be necessarily very few and, therefore, we will now consider what ordinary women can accomplish if they will try.
('16', 272, 1, 5, 607026) Their first attempt should be directed towards awakening in the minds of as many women as possible a proper sense of their present condition.
('16', 272, 1, 6, 607168) I am not among those who believe that such an effort can be made through literary education only.
('16', 272, 1, 7, 607266) To work on that basis would be to postpone indefinitely the accomplishment of our aims ; I have experienced at every step that it is not at all necessary to wait so long.
('16', 272, 1, 8, 607437) We can bring home to our women the sad realities of their present condition without, in the first instance, giving them any literary education.
('16', 272, 1, 9, 607581) I am just returning from a district of Bihar.
('16', 272, 1, 10, 607627) I once met there a large group of women from respectable families of the place.
('16', 272, 1, 11, 607707) They all observed purdah.
('16', 272, 1, 12, 607733) In my presence, they removed the purdah as they would in the presence of a brother.
('16', 272, 1, 13, 607817) These women had had no education.
('16', 272, 1, 14, 607851) Just before I went to meet them, an English woman had been to see me.
('16', 272, 1, 15, 607921) She had called on me where I sat surrounded by a number of men.
('16', 272, 1, 16, 607985) To meet the Hindu women, on the other hand, I had to go into a room specially set apart.
('16', 272, 1, 17, 608074) Half seriously, I suggested that we could go to the room where the men were sitting.
('16', 272, 1, 18, 608159) All enthusiasm, they said that they would be only too happy to do so, but that the custom being what it was, they would need the men’s permission.
('16', 272, 1, 19, 608306) They did not like the purdah at all [they said] and wanted me to see that the custom was ended.
('16', 272, 1, 20, 608402) While there is tragedy in these words, they also bear out what I have said above.
('16', 272, 1, 21, 608484) These women had realized their condition without having had any literary education.
('16', 272, 1, 22, 608568) They were right in asking my help, but I wanted them to have the strength themselves to win their freedom and they admitted, too, that they had such strength.
('16', 272, 1, 23, 608727) I have come away full of hope that we shall soon hear that these women have flung away the purdah.
('16', 272, 1, 24, 608826) Women who would ordinarily be considered uneducated are doing excellent work in Champaran.
('16', 272, 1, 25, 608917) They are waking up their extremely backward sisters to the freedom which they themselves enjoy.* Woman is the companion of man, gifted with equal mental capacities.
('16', 272, 1, 26, 609082) She has the right to participate in the very minutest detail in
('16', 273, 0, 1, 609146) 274 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 273, 1, 2, 609188) the activities of man and she has an equal right of freedom and liberty with him.
('16', 273, 1, 3, 609270) She is entitled to a supreme place in her own sphere of activity as man is in his.
('16', 273, 1, 4, 609353) This ought to be the natural condition of things and not as a result only of learning to read and write.
('16', 273, 1, 5, 609458) By sheer force of a vicious custom, even the most ignorant and worthless men have been enjoying a superiority over women which they do not deserve and ought not to have.
('16', 273, 1, 6, 609628) Many of our movements stop half way because of the condition of our women.
('16', 273, 1, 7, 609703) Much of our work does not yield appropriate results ; our lot is like that of the penny wise and pound foolish trader who does not employ enough capital in his business.
('16', 273, 1, 8, 609873) If I am right, a good many from among you, members of this Samaj, should go out to educate your ignorant sisters about their real condition.
('16', 273, 1, 9, 610014) In practical terms, this means that you should spare as much time as you can to visit the most backward localities in Bombay and give the women there what you have yourselves received.
('16', 273, 1, 10, 610199) If you have joined men in their religious, political and social activities, acquaint them with these.
('16', 273, 1, 11, 610301) If you have gained any special knowledge about the bringing up of children, impart it to them.
('16', 273, 1, 12, 610396) If you have studied and realized in your own experience the benefits of clean air, clean water, clean and simple food, and exercise, tell these women about them too.
('16', 273, 1, 13, 610562) In this way, you will raise yourselves and them.* But although much good and useful work can be done without a knowledge of reading and writing, yet it is my firm belief that you cannot always do without a knowledge thereof.
('16', 273, 1, 14, 610787) It develops and sharpens one’s intellect and it stimulates our power of doing good.
('16', 273, 1, 15, 610871) I have never placed an unnecessarily high value on the knowledge of reading and writing.
('16', 273, 1, 16, 610960) I am only attempting to assign its proper place to it.
('16', 273, 1, 17, 611015) I have pointed out from time to time [that] there is no justification for men to deprive women or to deny to them equal rights on the grounds of their illiteracy ; but education is essential for enabling women to uphold these natural rights, to improve them and to spread them; again, the true knowledge of self is unattainable by the millions who are without such education.
('16', 273, 1, 18, 611391) Many a book is full of innocent pleasure and this will be denied to us without education.
('16', 273, 1, 19, 611481) It is no exaggeration to say that a human being without education is not far removed from an animal.
('16', 273, 1, 20, 611582) Education, therefore, is necessary for women as it is for men.
('16', 273, 1, 21, 611645) Not that the methods of education should be identical in both cases.
('16', 273, 1, 22, 611714) In the first place, our State system of education is full of error and productive of harm in many respects.
('16', 273, 1, 23, 611822) It should be
('16', 274, 0, 1, 611835) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 275
('16', 274, 1, 2, 611881) eschewed by men and women alike.
('16', 274, 1, 3, 611914) Even if it were free from its present blemishes, I would not regard it as proper for women from all points of view.
('16', 274, 1, 4, 612030) Man and woman are of equal rank, but they are not identical.
('16', 274, 1, 5, 612091) They are a peerless pair, being supplementary to one another; each helps the other so that without the one the existence of the other cannot be conceived, and, therefore, it follows as a necessary corollary from these facts that anything that will impair the status of either of them will involve the equal ruin of them both.
('16', 274, 1, 6, 612417) In framing any scheme of women’s education, this cardinal truth must be constantly kept in mind.
('16', 274, 1, 7, 612514) Man is supreme in the outward activities of a married pair and, therefore, it is in the fitness of things that he should have a greater knowledge there of.
('16', 274, 1, 8, 612670) On the other hand, home life is entirely the sphere of woman and, therefore, in domestic affairs, in the upbringing and education of children, women ought to have more knowledge.
('16', 274, 1, 9, 612849) Not that knowledge should be divided into watertight compartments or that some branches of knowledge should be closed to any one ; but unless courses of instruction are based on a discriminating appreciation of these basic principles, the fullest life of man and woman cannot be developed.
('16', 274, 1, 10, 613139) I should say a word or two as to whether English education is or is not necessary for our women.
('16', 274, 1, 11, 613236) I have come to the conclusion that, in the ordinary course of our lives, neither our men nor our women need necessarily have any knowledge of English.
('16', 274, 1, 12, 613387) True, English is necessary for making a living and for active association in our political movements.
('16', 274, 1, 13, 613489) I do not believe in women working for a living or undertaking commercial enterprise.
('16', 274, 1, 14, 613574) The few women who may require or desire to have English education can very easily have their way by joining the schools for men.
('16', 274, 1, 15, 613703) Introduction of English education in schools meant for women could only lead to a prolongation of our helplessness.
('16', 274, 1, 16, 613819) I have often read and heard people saying that the rich treasures of English literature should be opened alike to men and women.
('16', 274, 1, 17, 613948) I submit in all humility that there is some misapprehension in assuming such an attitude.
('16', 274, 1, 18, 614038) No one intends to close these treasures against women while keeping them open for men.
('16', 274, 1, 19, 614125) There is none on earth able to prevent you from studying the literature of the whole world if you are fond of literary tastes.
('16', 274, 1, 20, 614252) But when courses of education have been framed with the needs of a particular society in view, you cannot supply the requirements of the few who have cultivated a literary taste.
('16', 274, 1, 21, 614431) Their needs can be met, after we are fully developed, by separate
('16', 275, 0, 1, 614497) 276 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 275, 1, 2, 614539) institutions as in Europe.
('16', 275, 1, 3, 614566) When, through a well planned scheme, large numbers of men and women begin to receive education and those who remain without it are looked upon as exceptions, we shall have plenty of writers in our languages to bring to us the pleasures of other literatures.
('16', 275, 1, 4, 614824) If we seek the pleasure of literature always in English our languages will remain poor, which means that we shall remain a poor people.
('16', 275, 1, 5, 614960) The habit of deriving enjoyment only from a foreign literature is, I must say, if you will pardon me the simile, like the thief’s habit of deriving pleasure from stolen goods.
('16', 275, 1, 6, 615136) The pleasure which Pope found in the Iliad he placed before the people in English of superb beauty.
('16', 275, 1, 7, 615236) The pleasure which Fitzgerald derived from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam made him render it in English of such power that millions of Englishmen keep his poem with them as they do the Bible.
('16', 275, 1, 8, 615426) The Bhagavad Gita filled Edwin Arnold with transports of joy ; he did not ask the people to learn Sanskrit in order that they may have the same joy, but put the work into English which would stand beside Sanskrit or Pali, pouring his very soul into the language, and thus shared his joy with his people.
('16', 275, 1, 9, 615730) Our being so very backward is a reason why such work should be undertaken among us on a much larger scale.
('16', 275, 1, 10, 615837) This will be possible only when a scheme such as I have suggested has been formulated and is firmly adhered to.
('16', 275, 1, 11, 615949) If only we can give up our infatuation with English and our lack of confidence in ourselves or in the capacity of our languages, the task is not difficult.*
('16', 275, 2, 12, 616106) In asking our men and women to spend less time in the study of English than they are doing now, my object is not to deprive them of the pleasure which they are likely to derive from it, but I hold that the same pleasure can be obtained at less cost and trouble if we follow a more natural method.
('16', 275, 2, 13, 616403) The world is full of many a gem of priceless beauty; but then those gems are not all of English setting.
('16', 275, 2, 14, 616508) Other languages can well boast of productions of similar excellence; all these should be made available to our common people and that can only be done if our own learned men will undertake to translate them for us in our own languages.
('16', 275, 3, 15, 616744) Merely to have outlined a scheme of education as above is not to have removed the bane of child marriage from our society or to have conferred on our women an equality of rights.
('16', 275, 3, 16, 616923) Let us now consider the case of our girls who disappear, so to say, from view after marriage.
('16', 275, 3, 17, 617017) They are not likely to return to our schools.

('16', 276, 1, 2, 617122) the unspeakable and unthinkable sin of the child marriage of their daughters, their mothers cannot think of educating them or of otherwise making their dry life a cheerful one.
('16', 276, 1, 3, 617299) The man who marries a young girl does not do so out of any altruistic motives, but through sheer lust.
('16', 276, 1, 4, 617402) Who is to rescue these girls ?
('16', 276, 1, 5, 617433) A proper answer to this question will also be a solution of the woman’s problem.
('16', 276, 1, 6, 617514) The answer is albeit difficult, but it is the only one.
('16', 276, 1, 7, 617570) There is, of course, none to champion her cause but her husband.
('16', 276, 1, 8, 617635) It is useless to expect a child wife to be able to bring round the man who has married her.
('16', 276, 1, 9, 617727) The difficult work must, therefore, for the present at least, be left to man.
('16', 276, 1, 10, 617805) If I could, I would take a census of child wives and would find the friends of their husbands and through such friends, as well as through moral and polite exhortations, I will attempt to bring home to them the enormity of their crimes in linking their fortunes with child wives and will warn them that there is no expiation for that sin unless and until they have by education made their wives fit not only to bear children but also to bring them up properly, and unless, in the meantime, they live a life of absolute celibacy.
('16', 276, 2, 11, 618334) Thus there are many fruitful fields of activity before the members of the Bhagini Samaj for devoting their energies to.
('16', 276, 2, 12, 618454) The field for work is so vast that, if resolute application is brought to bear thereon, the wider movements for reform may, for the present, well be left to themselves and great service can be done to the cause of Home Rule without so much as even a verbal reference to it.
('16', 276, 2, 13, 618728) When printing presses were non existent and scope for speech making very limited, when one could hardly travel twenty four miles in the course of a day instead of a thousand miles as now, we had only one agency for propagating our ideals and that was our ‘acts’; and acts had immense potency.
('16', 276, 2, 14, 619021) We are now rushing to and fro with the velocity of air, delivering speeches, writing newspaper articles, and yet we fall short of our accomplishments and the cry of despair fills the air.
('16', 276, 2, 15, 619209) I for one am of opinion that, as in old days, our acts will have a more powerful influence on the public than any number of speeches and writings.
('16', 276, 2, 16, 619356) It is my earnest prayer to your Association that its members should give prominence to quiet and unobtrusive work in whatever it does.

('16', 277, 7, 15, 620242) Surely you know the reason why.
('16', 277, 7, 16, 620274) Before telling you something about my activity, I want to answer an important question you have asked — a question which shows how closely you have been following my doings in this part of the world.
('16', 277, 7, 17, 620474) You have reminded me of what I used to say in London, viz., that benign autocracy was the best form of Government, and have asked me how I reconcile [this with] my activity in connection with the Home Rule movement.
('16', 277, 7, 18, 620690) I still retain the position held by me in London.
('16', 277, 7, 19, 620740) But that form of Government is an impossibility today.

('16', 278, 7, 13, 622702) DEAR SHRI GORDHANBHAI 1, The most respected Anasuyabehn, Shankarlal Banker and I have just returned from a meeting of workers.
('16', 278, 7, 14, 622829) They said the mill owners wanted them to give something in writing in return for a concession of eight annas.
('16', 278, 7, 15, 622939) I have told them not to affix their signature to any document without consulting their advisers and also that we would advise them in a day or two what increase they could reasonably demand.
('16', 278, 7, 16, 623130) They would serve their interests well, I told them, if they went by our advice and accepted the suggested figure.
('16', 278, 7, 17, 623244) I politely explained yesterday to members of the Mill group my responsibility in the matter.
('16', 278, 7, 18, 623337) I think the principle of arbitration is of far reaching consequence and it is not at all desirable that the mill hands should lose faith in it.
('16', 278, 7, 19, 623481) 2 I find it impossible, therefore, to run away from this duty which has come to me unsought.
('16', 278, 7, 20, 623574) Shankarlal Banker and Vallabhbhai Patel agree with me.
('16', 278, 7, 21, 623629) It is not desirable, from the workers’ point of view and yours, in fact from that of us all, that they remain

('16', 279, 1, 4, 624135) I shall be obliged if you send me, without delay, a statement of the wages paid by the local mills.
('16', 279, 1, 5, 624235) I should also be happy if the Mill group could favour us with its views on the different categories of workers without in any way binding itself to accept our decision.
('16', 279, 1, 6, 624404) If any of you could join us in our deliberations without being committed in any way, our conclusions would be the more reasoned for that.
('16', 279, 1, 7, 624542) I am not particularly disposed to favour workers as workers; I am on the side of justice and often this is found to be on their side.
('16', 279, 1, 8, 624676) Hence the general belief that I am on their side.
('16', 279, 1, 9, 624726) I can never think of harming the great industry of Ahmedabad.
('16', 279, 1, 10, 624788) I hope, therefore, that your Association will extend its full co operation to us in this difficult task.

('16', 279, 5, 17, 625205) DEAR MR. GHOSAL, After leaving you yesterday, I went to Naika and Nawagam.
('16', 279, 5, 18, 625280) I find that the condition of the villagers in these two villages is pitiable.
('16', 279, 5, 19, 625358) I think that they are able to make out a very strong case for total remission.
('16', 279, 5, 20, 625437) They tell me that they have had three successive bad seasons.
('16', 279, 5, 21, 625499) I endeavour to find their anna valuation.
('16', 279, 5, 22, 625541) I think it can be easily proved to be under four annas in every case.
('16', 279, 5, 23, 625611) They say that their crops were inevitably damaged by the overflow of the Khari canal being turned on to their land.
('16', 279, 5, 24, 625727) Their rabi crops are negligible.
('16', 279, 5, 25, 625760) This is truer of Nawagam than of Naika and in neither case is the rabi crop on their acreage more than four annas and owing to the disease that
('16', 279, 6, 26, 625904) 1 On a study of the wage scales in Ahmedabad and Bombay, Gandhiji later came to the conclusion that a 35 per cent increase in wages would be a fair demand.
('16', 279, 6, 27, 626060) The mill owners failed to assist Gandhiji with a definite opinion on this basis.
('16', 279, 6, 28, 626141) The situation deteriorated.

('16', 280, 1, 3, 626353) I find however that about fifteen notices of forfeitures have been served upon the villagers in Naika for failure to pay the revenue dues.
('16', 280, 1, 4, 626492) The people in the surrounding villages give the same version as to their crops but I am unable as yet to make any submission on their behalf.
('16', 280, 1, 5, 626634) I hope to finish my investigation in those parts very soon.
('16', 280, 1, 6, 626694) May I request that the notices served on some of the inhabitants of Naika may be withdrawn and that the condition in the Daskroi be thoroughly inquired into.

('16', 281, 3, 4, 627900) MY DEAR DEODHAR 1, I have your two letters and the report.
('16', 281, 3, 5, 627959) I do feel that you have unconsciously injured the cause and have allowed yourself to be made a tool in Mr. Pratt’s hands.
('16', 281, 3, 6, 628081) You have based your statement about the undervaluation on the part of the raiyats on totally insufficient data.
('16', 281, 3, 7, 628193) Amritlal Thakkar 2, who went into details, does not think that 3_ annas is an undervaluation.
('16', 281, 3, 8, 628287) You know that the official valuation has undergone manipulation.
('16', 281, 3, 9, 628352) And how can it be said that the substantial concessions have been made when we know that not a single concession has yet been made?
('16', 281, 3, 10, 628484) He was simply with us when Mr. Pratt said that postponement would be granted when the rabi 3 was over 25%.
('16', 281, 3, 11, 628591) Do you realize that rabi does not include cotton, tobacco, tuvar 4 and diveli 5?
('16', 281, 3, 12, 628672) Where was the necessity for publishing the report at all?
('16', 281, 3, 13, 628730) When I entered upon the scene, you might well have left the judging of the moment of publication to me.
('16', 281, 3, 14, 628834) Lastly, why think that we can only gain what the officials give ?
('16', 281, 3, 15, 628900) Why not feel that we must get what we deserve?
('16', 281, 3, 16, 628947) I feel that you are not doing justice to yourself or the cause you handle by attempting too much.
('16', 281, 3, 17, 629045) You are ailing.
('16', 281, 3, 18, 629061) You have more irons in the fire than you can handle.
('16', 281, 3, 19, 629114) You should have boldly said you could not undertake the inquiry.
('16', 281, 3, 20, 629179) I know you will not misunderstand my letter.
('16', 281, 3, 21, 629224) I love you too well to do you conscious injustice.

('16', 282, 6, 12, 630283) SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM, SABARMATI, February 26, 1918
('16', 282, 7, 13, 630331) DEAR MR. GHOSAL, My co workers and I have so far completed our investigation of a number of villages covering all the talukas.
('16', 282, 7, 14, 630458) I attach hereto a list containing the names of such villages with the annawari found by us and hope shortly to send another containing the remaining villages.
('16', 282, 7, 15, 630617) I have already explained to you the method adopted for finding the annawari.
('16', 282, 7, 16, 630694) The rabi and the kharif now standing furnish tangible material enabling one to arrive at absolutely accurate results.
('16', 282, 7, 17, 630812) I do not know that it is contended by any of your Talatis that the harvested kharif crops were in any but the rarest cases more than four annas.
('16', 282, 7, 18, 630957) It is submitted that the crops still standing in the majority of the villages will not yield more than a four anna harvest and I do hope that if you are not satisfied with the first hand testimony 1 of myself and my co workers, you will, whilst there is yet time, secure an independent valuation by appointing a joint committee of inspection.
('16', 282, 7, 19, 631300) I observe that hundreds of villagers have paid the first instalment as they say under pressure brought to bear upon them.
('16', 282, 7, 20, 631422) Many have been made, so it appears, even to pay both the instalments at once.
('16', 282, 8, 21, 631500) 1 On arrival at Nadiad, on February 16, Gandhiji and his fellow workers had themselves divided into groups, each of which undertook investigation of crop conditions in a number of villages.
('16', 282, 8, 22, 631690) In a week’s time reports in regard to 425 out of 600 villages had become available and Gandhiji had personally investigated conditions in 30 villages.
('16', 282, 8, 23, 631841) The findings formed the basis of his letter to the District authorities.
('16', 283, 0, 1, 631914) 284 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 283, 1, 2, 631956) Many believe that they have been obliged to sell their cattle and other personal effects for paying the assessment.
('16', 283, 1, 3, 632072) I am sure that you do not desire to collect on such terms.
('16', 283, 1, 4, 632131) I hope, therefore that you will be pleased to grant full suspension in the cases of the villages in my list against which the annawari is put down at four annas or under.
('16', 283, 1, 5, 632302) I am aware that half suspension has been granted in some cases.
('16', 283, 2, 6, 632366) Mohwa trees in several localities are being destroyed on a wholesale scale, partly on account of the Mohwa Act and partly also because of the prevailing scarcity.
('16', 283, 2, 7, 632529) Whatever may be the cause I am sure you will agree with me that such destruction should be prevented so far as possible and you will make it possible by granting the relief suggested by me.
('16', 283, 2, 8, 632719) In this connection I wish to draw your attention to the fact that the villagers fall back, especially in times of scarcity, on the fruits of their trees for food.
('16', 283, 2, 9, 632882) They should therefore be allowed at least for the current year unrestricted use of Mohwa flowers.
('16', 283, 3, 10, 632980) An additional and strong reason for granting suspension is to be found in the ravages being made by the plague in the Kaira District.
('16', 283, 3, 11, 633114) Thousands, as you are aware, are living in sheds erected at, to them, no small cost.
('16', 283, 3, 12, 633199) Many families have lost their wage earners.
('16', 283, 3, 13, 633243) The villagers’ ordinary activities have been interrupted for the time being.
('16', 283, 4, 14, 633320) I fear there will be within a very short period great scarcity of fodder.
('16', 283, 4, 15, 633394) I have no doubt that this matter has not escaped your attention.
('16', 283, 4, 16, 633459) In view of the suspense under which everybody in Kaira is living.
('16', 283, 4, 17, 633525) I shall be obliged if you could let me know as early as is convenient to you your decision regarding the recommendation submitted by me.
('16', 283, 4, 18, 633662) I need hardly add that I am at your service should you desire my presence.
('16', 283, 4, 19, 633737) I should perhaps say that I may have to leave for Delhi first of March.

('16', 284, 2, 3, 634081) February 26, 1918
('16', 284, 3, 4, 634099) LEAFLET NO.
('16', 284, 4, 5, 634111) The lock out commenced on February 22. From that date the workers of the Weaving Department have been compelled to go without work.
('16', 284, 4, 6, 634243) When the mill owners issued notices withdrawing the Plague Bonus and there was unrest because of this, the employers resolved to get the dispute settled by arbitration and it was assumed that the workers would agree.
('16', 284, 4, 7, 634460) Accordingly, the mill owners resolved, on February 14, to appoint an arbitration board to decide what increase in lieu of the Plague Bonus was justified by the increase in the cost of living.
('16', 284, 4, 8, 634652) Mahatma Gandhi, Shri Shankarlal Banker and Shri Vallabhbhai Patel representing the workers, and Sheth Ambalal Sarabhai, Sheth Jagabhai Dalpatbhai and Sheth Chandulal representing the employers, with the Collector as Chairman, were appointed to arbitrate.
('16', 284, 4, 9, 634907) Thereafter, workers in some of the mills struck work owing to a misunder standing.
('16', 284, 4, 10, 634990) That was a mistake and the workers were ready to rectify it.
('16', 284, 4, 11, 635051) The employers, however, thought that the workers were in the wrong in striking before the Award was given by the arbitrators and that, therefore, they would be justified in cancelling their resolution regarding arbitration and this they did.
('16', 284, 4, 12, 635293) They simultaneously passed a resolution to the effect that workers be paid their due wages and be discharged if they were not content with a 20 per cent increase.
('16', 284, 4, 13, 635456) The weavers were not satisfied and accepted discharge, and the lock out by the employers commenced.
('16', 284, 4, 14, 635556) But the arbitrators for the workers felt it their responsibility to tell the workers, under the circumstances, what increase they could properlydemand.
('16', 284, 4, 15, 635708) But before doing so, they consulted amongst themselves and, after giving full consideration to the interests of both the mill owners and
('16', 284, 5, 16, 635845) 1 Apart from visits to workers’ houses and public meetings for educating the workers about the struggle, it was decided to “issue instructive leaflets every day with a view to fixing firmly in their minds the principles and significance of the struggle, and to supply them with simple but elevating literature which would conduce to their mental and intellectual development and enable them to leave for posterity a heritage of the means for its progress.” The leaflets were issued in the name of Anasuyabehn Sarabhai but, as stated by Mahadev Desai in Ek Dharmayuddha, of which A Righteous Struggle was the English edition, they were in fact written by Gandhiji.
('16', 284, 5, 17, 636509) This leaflet appeared on the fifth day of the lock out.
('16', 284, 5, 18, 636565) The leaflets were read out at the public meetings in the evenings.
('16', 285, 0, 1, 636632) 286 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 285, 1, 2, 636674) the workers and to all the other circumstances, decided that an increase of 35 per cent was justified and that the workers be advised accordingly.
('16', 285, 1, 3, 636821) But before doing so they intimated their intention to the mill owners and promised to consider if they had anything to say against it.
('16', 285, 1, 4, 636956) The employers did not express their view on this matter.
('16', 285, 1, 5, 637013) The workers, whose demand was for a 50 per cent increase, withdrew it and resolved to ask for a 35 per cent increase.
('16', 285, 2, 6, 637131) WORKERS’ PLEDGE The workers have resolved: (1) that they will not resume work until a 35 per cent increase on the July wages is secured; (2) that they will not, during the period of the lock out, cause any disturbance or resort to violence or indulge in looting, nor damage any property of the employers or abuse anyone, but will remain peaceful.
('16', 285, 2, 7, 637478) How the workers can succeed in their pledge will be discussed in the next leaflet.
('16', 285, 2, 8, 637561) If workers have anything to tell me 1, they are welcome to see me at my place at any hour of the day.

('16', 285, 4, 11, 637728) February 26, 1918
('16', 285, 5, 12, 637746) I read your letter on the Gujarat Sabha.
('16', 285, 5, 13, 637787) It is the duty of all of us to do something for the people of Kheda.
('16', 285, 5, 14, 637856) If the Sabha failed to discharge this duty, I think it would forfeit its right to its name.
('16', 285, 5, 15, 637948) The responsibility for the advice that is being given to the people is chiefly mine.
('16', 285, 5, 16, 638033) Their case is that the crops have been less than four annas.
('16', 285, 5, 17, 638094) The Government admits that, when the crop is less than four annas, no revenue can be collected from the ryots that year.
('16', 285, 5, 18, 638215) If the Government does not grant the ryots’ demands, they have only one course open to them and that is to refuse to pay revenue to the Government and even let it auction their properties.

('16', 286, 1, 2, 638574) Assessment is in proportion to the capacity of the land.
('16', 286, 1, 3, 638631) It is quite plain that, if the land does not yield anything, no tax can be collected.
('16', 286, 1, 4, 638717) The Government’s regulation permitting payment by instalments is not a favour but an absolute necessity.
('16', 286, 1, 5, 638822) I perceive, however, that the difference of opinion between you and the Sabha on this issue is likely to remain.
('16', 286, 1, 6, 638935) For public workers to tolerate such differences is but a part of their job.
('16', 286, 1, 7, 639011) Both points of view may be placed before the people; it will then be for them to choose.
('16', 286, 1, 8, 639100) It seems self evident to me that there is nothing unlawful if, to express one’s sense of injustice, one refuses to pay a tax, in a perfectly civil manner, and lets it be collected [forcibly].

('16', 286, 5, 11, 639384) SABARMATI, February 26, 1918
('16', 286, 6, 12, 639413) Today is the fifth day of the lock out.
('16', 286, 6, 13, 639453) Some of you probably think that everything will be all right after a week or two of suffering.
('16', 286, 6, 14, 639548) I repeat that, though we may hope that our struggle will end early, we must remain firm even if that hope is not realized and must not resume work even if we have to die.
('16', 286, 6, 15, 639719) Workers have no money but they possess a wealth superior to money—they have their hands, their courage and their fear of God.
('16', 286, 6, 16, 639845) If a time comes when you have to starve, have confidence that we shall eat only after feeding you.
('16', 286, 6, 17, 639944) We shall not allow you to die of starvation.
('16', 286, 7, 18, 639989) Some workers say that we can demand more than 35 per cent.
('16', 286, 7, 19, 640048) I say you can demand even a 100 per cent increase.
('16', 286, 7, 20, 640099) But it would be unjust if you do so.
('16', 286, 7, 21, 640136) Be content, in the present circumstances, with what you have demanded.
('16', 286, 7, 22, 640207) If you ask for more, it will pain me.
('16', 286, 7, 23, 640245) We cannot
('16', 286, 8, 24, 640255) 1 The workers gathered every evening, during this time, under a babul tree on the banks of the Sabarmati.
('16', 286, 8, 25, 640361) Gandhiji addressed them.
('16', 286, 8, 26, 640386) Mahadev Desai records: “Very few except those who attended these meetings know what historic incidents occurred under that babul tree.” 2 The workers’ advisers had taken a pledge to this effect.
('16', 287, 0, 1, 640581) 288 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 287, 1, 2, 640623) demand anything unreasonable from anybody.
('16', 287, 1, 3, 640666) I think that the demand for 35 per cent is quite fair.

('16', 287, 3, 5, 640753) 177. PRAYER DISCOURSE AT ASHRAM 2
('16', 287, 4, 6, 640787) February 27, 1918
('16', 287, 5, 7, 640805) I have always said that it is not only against Government that satyagraha can be employed.
('16', 287, 5, 8, 640896) It can be employed in any situation, against any person or body.
('16', 287, 5, 9, 640961) We see examples of this just now.
('16', 287, 5, 10, 640995) In Kheda, satyagraha has been going on against the Government and in Ahmedabad against the rich and also against the scriptures on the issue of the untouchables.
('16', 287, 5, 11, 641157) My feeling is that we are bound to win on all these issues.
('16', 287, 5, 12, 641217) Truth is on our side.
('16', 287, 5, 13, 641239) In Kheda, the Government was high handed and we had no option but to offer satyagraha against it.
('16', 287, 5, 14, 641337) If we don’t succeed, the reason will be our own limitations and not anything inherent in satyagraha.
('16', 287, 5, 15, 641438) We succeeded in Bihar because there I got very sincere co workers.
('16', 287, 5, 16, 641505) Here I don’t see the same sincerity, but I am having more than I had expected.
('16', 287, 5, 17, 641584) The situation that has developed in Ahmedabad is also very heart warming.
('16', 287, 5, 18, 641658) I feel like repeating to you what the Collector told me yesterday, something which I have not mentioned anywhere else.
('16', 287, 5, 19, 641777) I think I can say it in the Ashram.
('16', 287, 5, 20, 641813) The Collector did not mean it as mere formality ; he said what he really felt.
('16', 287, 5, 21, 641892) For the first time in his life, he said, he saw here a struggle between workers and mill owners conducted with mutual regard.
('16', 287, 5, 22, 642018) I, too, don’t think I have ever observed as good relations between the parties as here.
('16', 287, 5, 23, 642106) As you see, Shri Ambalal 3 is on the other side in this struggle but he dined here yesterday.
('16', 287, 5, 24, 642200) When I told him that he was to do so again today, he understood my meaning.
('16', 287, 5, 25, 642276) He saw why I wanted him to dine with me and immediately agreed.
('16', 287, 5, 26, 642340) What could be more beautiful than this ?
('16', 287, 5, 27, 642381) If we have the firmness and purity and display the single minded devotion which the circumstances require, I
('16', 287, 6, 28, 642490) 1 The rest of the speech is not available.
('16', 287, 6, 29, 642533) Reports of speeches were deliberately withheld from the newspapers.
('16', 287, 6, 30, 642601) Portions of Gandhiji’s speeches and discourses on the subjects of the leaflets were given by Mahadev Desai in his book.
('16', 287, 6, 31, 642721) 2 It was customary for Gandhiji to address the gathering at the early morning prayers.

('16', 288, 1, 3, 642898) I am not in a position to keep you informed of all that is happening ; you will be the better able to maintain self discipline for not being so informed.
('16', 288, 1, 4, 643052) In the present situation, we have only to get ready to work, if required.
('16', 288, 1, 5, 643126) All that we need to do for the purpose is to cultivate firmness and self discipline.

('16', 288, 3, 8, 643290) February 27, 1918
('16', 288, 4, 9, 643308) LEAFLET NO.
('16', 288, 5, 10, 643320) We saw in yesterday’s leaflet what the workers’ pledge was.
('16', 288, 5, 11, 643380) We have now to consider what we should do to carry out that pledge.
('16', 288, 5, 12, 643448) We know that the employers have crores of rupees and the workers have nothing.
('16', 288, 5, 13, 643527) If workers have no money however, they have hands and feet with which they can work, and there is no part of the world which can do without workers.
('16', 288, 5, 14, 643676) Hence, if only he knows it, the worker holds the key to the situation.
('16', 288, 5, 15, 643747) Wealth is unavailing without him.
('16', 288, 5, 16, 643781) If he realizes this, he can be sure of success.
('16', 288, 5, 17, 643829) But the worker who would wield such power must possess certain qualities of character, without which he would be at the mercy of others.
('16', 288, 5, 18, 643966) Let us see what these qualities are.
('16', 288, 5, 19, 644003) 1. The worker should be truthful.
('16', 288, 5, 20, 644037) There is no reason for him to tell a lie.
('16', 288, 5, 21, 644079) Even if he tells a lie, he will not get the desired wage.
('16', 288, 5, 22, 644137) The truthful man can be firm and a worker who is firm is never defeated.
('16', 288, 5, 23, 644210) 2. He should possess courage.
('16', 288, 5, 24, 644240) Many of us become permanent slaves through fear of what might happen to us if we lost our jobs.
('16', 288, 5, 25, 644336) 3. He should have a sense of justice.
('16', 288, 5, 26, 644374) If he asks for wages higher than his deserts, there will be hardly anyone who will employ him.
('16', 288, 5, 27, 644469) The increase we have demanded in this struggle is reasonable.
('16', 288, 5, 28, 644531) We should, therefore, have faith that sooner or later we are bound to get justice.
('16', 288, 5, 29, 644614) 4. He will not be angry with his employer nor bear him any grudge.
('16', 288, 5, 30, 644681) After all, when everything is over, the worker is to serve under him.
('16', 288, 5, 31, 644751) Every human being is liable to err.
('16', 288, 5, 32, 644787) We think the employers are in the wrong in refusing the increase asked for.
('16', 288, 5, 33, 644863) If we remain straightforward till the end, the employers are sure to revise their attitude.
('16', 288, 5, 34, 644955) At present they are angry.
('16', 288, 5, 35, 644982) Also, they suspect that, if the present demands of the workers are granted, they will repeatedly harass them.
('16', 288, 5, 36, 645092) To remove this
('16', 289, 0, 1, 645107) 290 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 289, 1, 2, 645149) suspicion, we should do our utmost to reassure the employers by our behaviour.
('16', 289, 1, 3, 645228) The first thing to that end is to harbour no grudge against them.
('16', 289, 1, 4, 645294) 5. Every worker should remember that the struggle is bound to involve suffering.
('16', 289, 1, 5, 645375) But happiness follows suffering voluntarily undertaken.
('16', 289, 1, 6, 645431) It is but suffering for the worker to be denied a wage sufficient to enable him to make both ends meet.
('16', 289, 1, 7, 645535) Because of our ignorance, however, we endure this and manage to live somehow.
('16', 289, 1, 8, 645613) Seeking a remedy against this suffering, we have told the employers that it is not possible for us to maintain ourselves without the wage increase demanded and that, if it is not granted to us and we are not saved from continuous starvation, we would rather starve right now.
('16', 289, 1, 9, 645889) How long will the employers remain unmoved by our suffering ?
('16', 289, 1, 10, 645951) 6. Lastly, the poor have their saviour in God.
('16', 289, 1, 11, 645998) Our duty is to make the effort and then, remain fully assured that we are bound to get what He has ordained for us, remain peaceful while our request is not yet granted.
('16', 289, 1, 12, 646168) A worker who behaves in this manner will never find it difficult to keep his pledge.
('16', 289, 1, 13, 646253) We shall discuss in tomorrow’s leaflet how the workers may maintain themselves during the period of the lock out.

('16', 289, 4, 17, 646457) DEAR MR. GHOSAL, I had a chat with Mr. Pratt today and I suggested that if it was not presumptuous to ask, I should like to be allowed to accompany you in your tour of inquiry into a few typical villages.
('16', 289, 4, 18, 646662) Could I do so and if I could will you please give me previous notice?

('16', 290, 2, 3, 646973) February 27, 1918
('16', 290, 3, 4, 646991) MY DEAR FRIEND, I am ashamed of myself.
('16', 290, 3, 5, 647031) I am most anxious to be there.
('16', 290, 3, 6, 647062) Yet the facts seem to have conspired against me.
('16', 290, 3, 7, 647111) The strike is still on and it is of such a delicate nature that I dare not leave it.
('16', 290, 3, 8, 647196) The Kaira affair, too, involving as it does the rights of several lacs of people, demands my attention.
('16', 290, 3, 9, 647300) I know that delay about Ali brothers is dangerous.
('16', 290, 3, 10, 647351) I therefore stay where I am till I feel free.
('16', 290, 3, 11, 647397) I know you will not have me do otherwise.
('16', 290, 3, 12, 647439) Will you please apologize to Maulana Saheb ?
('16', 290, 3, 13, 647484) Do please keep me informed of what goes on there.

('16', 290, 8, 19, 647663) February 27, 1918
('16', 290, 9, 20, 647681) RAMDAS, I keep worrying about you these days.
('16', 290, 9, 21, 647727) I detect a note of despondency in your letters.
('16', 290, 9, 22, 647775) It seems you feel the want of education.
('16', 290, 9, 23, 647816) You feel, too, that you have not settled down to anything.
('16', 290, 9, 24, 647875) If only you were with me, I would take you on my lap and comfort you.
('16', 290, 9, 25, 647945) In the measure in which I fail to make you happy, I think I must be wanting in something.
('16', 290, 9, 26, 648035) There must be something lacking in my love.
('16', 290, 9, 27, 648079) Please think of any wrongs I may have done as unintended and forgive me.
('16', 290, 9, 28, 648152) Children are entitled to much from their parents, being all submission to them.
('16', 290, 9, 29, 648232) A mistake on the part of the parents will ruin their lives.
('16', 290, 9, 30, 648292) Our scriptures place parents on a level with God.
('16', 290, 9, 31, 648342) It is not always that parents in this world are fit to carry such responsibility.
('16', 290, 9, 32, 648424) Being but earthly, they pass on the legacy to their children and so from generation to generation mere embodiments of selfishness come into this world.
('16', 290, 9, 33, 648576) Why should you think that you are an unworthy son?
('16', 290, 9, 34, 648627) If you are so, don’t you see that that would prove that I was unworthy ?
('16', 290, 9, 35, 648700) I don’t want to be reckoned as unworthy ; how could you be so then?
('16', 290, 9, 36, 648768) You may work for money, but you will not sacrifice truth for its sake and, though you have been thinking of marriage, you will exercise your judgement ; and hence I, for my part, will always think of you as
('16', 291, 0, 1, 648975) 292 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 291, 1, 2, 649017) a worthy son.
('16', 291, 1, 3, 649031) You need not ask my forgiveness.
('16', 291, 1, 4, 649064) You have given me no reason to be unhappy.
('16', 291, 1, 5, 649107) I want you to come over to me after your experiments there are over.
('16', 291, 1, 6, 649176) I shall do my part to see you married.
('16', 291, 1, 7, 649215) If you want to study, I shall help you.
('16', 291, 1, 8, 649255) If you but train your body to be as strong as steel, we shall see to the rest.
('16', 291, 1, 9, 649334) At the moment, we are scattered wide apart.
('16', 291, 1, 10, 649378) You there, Manilal in Phoenix, Deva in Badharwa, Ba in Bhitiharwa, Harilal in Calcutta, and myself ever on the move from place to place.
('16', 291, 1, 11, 649515) May be, in this separation lies service to the nation and the way to spiritual uplift.
('16', 291, 1, 12, 649602) Whether that is so or not, let us bear with a cheerful mind what has fallen to our lot.

('16', 291, 5, 16, 649791) February 27, 1918 1
('16', 291, 6, 17, 649811) There are but few to give you good advice and courage.
('16', 291, 6, 18, 649866) Many will try to discourage you, and these may include even your friends.
('16', 291, 6, 19, 649940) Many will advise you to accept as much as you can get and be thankful to God for it.
('16', 291, 6, 20, 650025) This sounds sweet but really it is very bitter advice.
('16', 291, 6, 21, 650080) We must not admit helplessness except before God.
('16', 291, 6, 22, 650130) Do not feel helpless even if you have no money, since, in any case, we have hands and feet, all of us.
('16', 291, 6, 23, 650233) We shall be masters of our own affairs only if we use our hands and feet.
('16', 291, 6, 24, 650307) We have to be firm, moreover, in order that we may have good standing with the mill owners.
('16', 291, 6, 25, 650399) In the circumstances in which we are placed, we should tell them that we are not prepared to submit to such pressure from them.
('16', 291, 6, 26, 650527) You may seek my advice or that of somebody else ; in this matter, however, you can succeed without help from anyone.
('16', 291, 6, 27, 650644) I and a hundred thousand more cannot bring you success.
('16', 291, 6, 28, 650700) Your success depends on yourselves, upon your sincerity, upon your faith in God and upon your courage.
('16', 291, 6, 29, 650803) We are merely your helpers.
('16', 291, 6, 30, 650831) You have to stand on your own strength.
('16', 291, 6, 31, 650871) Stand by your unwritten and unspoken pledge and success is yours.
('16', 291, 7, 32, 650937) 1 The speech was delivered on the sixth day of the lock out.
('16', 291, 7, 33, 650998) 2 The observations that follow related to the leaflet issued on the day.
('16', 292, 0, 1, 651071) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 293
('16', 292, 1, 2, 651117) If you had accepted defeat from the beginning, I would not have come to you, nor would have Anasuyabehn ; but you decided to put up a fight.
('16', 292, 1, 3, 651258) The news has spread all over India.
('16', 292, 1, 4, 651294) In due course, the world will know that Ahmedabad workers have taken a pledge, with God as their witness, that they will not resume work until they have achieved their object.
('16', 292, 1, 5, 651470) In future, your children will look at this tree and say that their fathers took a solemn pledge under it, with God as their witness.
('16', 292, 1, 6, 651603) If you do not fulfil that pledge, what will your children think of you ?
('16', 292, 1, 7, 651676) The future of your posterity depends on you.
('16', 292, 1, 8, 651721) I urge you all, do not allow yourselves to be dissuaded by anyone and give up the pledge ; stand by it firmly.
('16', 292, 1, 9, 651832) You may have to starve to death.
('16', 292, 1, 10, 651865) Even so, you should declare that you have taken the pledge with God as your witness ; you have taken it not because Gandhi wanted you to do so, but in the name of God.
('16', 292, 1, 11, 652033) Stand by your pledge faithfully and continue the struggle.
('16', 292, 1, 12, 652092) India will then see that you were prepared to be ruined but did not give up your pledge.
('16', 292, 1, 13, 652181) Remember each word in these leaflets and keep the pledge conscientiously.
('16', 292, 1, 14, 652255) There is no point in knowing them by heart mechanically.
('16', 292, 1, 15, 652312) Many can repeat parrot like the Holy Koran or the Gita; some can recite both the Gita and the Tulsi Ramayana.
('16', 292, 1, 16, 652422) It is not enough, though, that one knows them by heart.
('16', 292, 1, 17, 652478) If, having learnt them by heart, you put the teaching into practice, rest assured that none can whittle down your 35 per cent even by a quarter per cent.

('16', 292, 5, 21, 652721) BHAISHRI RAOJIBHAI, Bhai Ambalal’s 2 death teaches us that we cannot afford to be slack even for a moment on the path of service [that we follow].
('16', 292, 5, 22, 652868) The King of Death may send his summons any time and, therefore, if we are content only to build castles in the air about national service but have no particular desire to exert ourselves, we may have to leave empty handed and all our aspirations will have been to no purpose.
('16', 292, 5, 23, 653144) Give my condolences to the people whom Ambalal has left behind

('16', 293, 5, 6, 653554) February 28, 1918
('16', 293, 6, 7, 653572) LEAFLET NO.
('16', 293, 7, 8, 653584) We have stated what the workers’ pledge is and considered how best they may fulfil it.
('16', 293, 7, 9, 653671) Today we shall discuss how the workers may keep themselves occupied during the lock out.
('16', 293, 7, 10, 653760) There is a proverb among us that an idle man busies himself with mischief.
('16', 293, 7, 11, 653835) And so it is not at all good that ten thousand men should remain idle here in Ahmedabad.
('16', 293, 7, 12, 653924) A man who has been working all day feels quite lost if he suddenly finds himself without work.
('16', 293, 7, 13, 654019) The subject of this leaflet, therefore, is very important to us if we are to succeed in our aim.
('16', 293, 7, 14, 654116) Let us start by saying what the workers ought not to do: 1. They should not waste time in gambling.
('16', 293, 7, 15, 654216) 2. They should not spend it sleeping during the day.
('16', 293, 7, 16, 654269) 3. They should not keep talking, all the time, of the employers and the lock out.
('16', 293, 7, 17, 654351) 4. Many are in the habit of frequenting tea stalls and idling away their time in gossip or eating and drinking when they don’t need to.
('16', 293, 7, 18, 654487) Workers should keep away from such tea stalls.
('16', 293, 7, 19, 654534) 5. They should not go to the mills while the lock out continues.
('16', 293, 7, 20, 654599) Now about what the workers should do: 1. Many workers’ dwellings and their surroundings are generally dirty.
('16', 293, 7, 21, 654708) They are unable to attend to this when they are at work.
('16', 293, 7, 22, 654765) Now that they will have an enforced holiday, they should utilize some of the time in cleaning and repairing their houses and compounds.
('16', 293, 7, 23, 654901) 2. Those who are literate should spend their time in reading books and increasing their knowledge.
('16', 293, 7, 24, 655000) They can also teach the illiterate.
('16', 293, 7, 25, 655036) This way, they will learn to help each other.
('16', 293, 7, 26, 655082) Those who are fond of reading should go to the Dadabhai Library and Reading Room or other free

('16', 294, 1, 2, 655223) reading rooms.
('16', 294, 1, 3, 655238) 3. Those who know skilled work, such as tailoring, cabinet making or wood carving and engraving, can seek work for themselves.
('16', 294, 1, 4, 655365) If they fail to find any, they may approach us for help.
('16', 294, 1, 5, 655422) 4. Every person ought to have some knowledge of a subsidiary occupation besides the one from which he earns his livelihood.
('16', 294, 1, 6, 655546) Workers, therefore, can spend their time in learning some new and easy work.
('16', 294, 1, 7, 655623) They will have our help in this.
('16', 294, 1, 8, 655656) In India, a person in one occupation thinks it below his dignity to follow any other.
('16', 294, 1, 9, 655742) Besides, some occupations are considered low and degrading in themselves.
('16', 294, 1, 10, 655816) Both these ideas are wrong.
('16', 294, 1, 11, 655844) There is no question of inferiority or superiority among occupations which are essential for man’s existence.
('16', 294, 1, 12, 655954) Nor should we be ashamed of taking up an occupation other than the one we are used to.
('16', 294, 1, 13, 656041) We believe that weaving cloth, breaking stones, sawing or splitting wood or working on a farm are all necessary and honourable occupations.
('16', 294, 1, 14, 656181) We hope, therefore, that instead of wasting their time in doing nothing, workers will utilize it in some such useful work.
('16', 294, 1, 15, 656304) Having considered what workers should do, it is necessary to say what they may expect of me.
('16', 294, 1, 16, 656397) We shall say this in the next leaflet.

('16', 294, 3, 19, 656495) SABARMATI, February 28, 1918
('16', 294, 4, 20, 656524) DEAR MR. PRATT, Your frank talk of yesterday 1 encourages me to send you this letter.
('16', 294, 4, 21, 656610) The following is the position throughout India.
('16', 294, 4, 22, 656658) A new order of things is replacing the old.
('16', 294, 4, 23, 656702) It can be established peacefully or it must be preceded by some painful disturbances.
('16', 294, 4, 24, 656788) What it will be lies largely in the hands of civil servants like yourself, more than in those of the King’s representatives quite at the top.
('16', 294, 4, 25, 656930) You desire to do good, but you rule not by right of love, but by the force of fear.
('16', 294, 4, 26, 657014) The sum total of the
('16', 294, 5, 27, 657035) 1 Evidently, Gandhiji had an interview with the Commissioner on February 27, but no report of the discussion is available.
('16', 295, 0, 1, 657158) 296 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 295, 1, 2, 657200) energy of the civil service represents to the people the British Constitution.
('16', 295, 1, 3, 657279) You have failed, probably not through any fault of your own, to interpret it to the people as fully as you might have.
('16', 295, 1, 4, 657398) The result is the people dread your power to punish and they miss the good you desire to do.
('16', 295, 1, 5, 657491) The home rulers so named have become impatient of your authority.
('16', 295, 1, 6, 657557) They are a rapidly increasing power.
('16', 295, 1, 7, 657594) They find no difficulty in showing to the people the dreadful side of the civil service rule.
('16', 295, 1, 8, 657688) The people welcome them as their deliverers.
('16', 295, 1, 9, 657733) With nothing but love of the land and distrust of the officials to guide them, they spread ill will.
('16', 295, 1, 10, 657834) The order you represent knows this only too well and it naturally resents this insult.
('16', 295, 1, 11, 657921) And so the gulf widens.
('16', 295, 1, 12, 657945) I presumptuously believe that I can step into the breach and may succeed in stopping harmful disturbances during our passage to the new state of things.
('16', 295, 1, 13, 658098) I want, at the end of it, to see established not mutual distrust and the law of force, but mutual trust and the law of love.
('16', 295, 1, 14, 658223) I can only do so if I can show the people a better and more expeditious way of righting wrongs.
('16', 295, 1, 15, 658319) It is obviously bad if they submit to your order through fear and harbour ill will.
('16', 295, 1, 16, 658403) It is worse if, misguided, they resort to violence.
('16', 295, 1, 17, 658455) The only dignified and truly loyal and uplifting course for them is to show disapproval by disobeying your orders which they may consider to be unjust, and by knowingly and respectfully suffering the penalty of their breach.
('16', 295, 1, 18, 658680) I venture to think that advice to do so can be safely tendered in almost every conceivable case of a felt wrong, provided that all other recognized remedies have been previously tried.
('16', 295, 1, 19, 658865) I wish you could see the viewpoint submitted by me.
('16', 295, 1, 20, 658917) You will, I know, forgive me for my presumption in writing this letter.
('16', 295, 1, 21, 658989) Of course, I have written this irrespective of the Kaira trouble.
('16', 295, 1, 22, 659055) It is highly likely that I shall have the privilege of working with you on a more non contentious platform.
('16', 295, 1, 23, 659163) But I feel that it is better that you should know me with all my limitations.

('16', 296, 8, 9, 659594) LEAFLET NO.
('16', 296, 9, 10, 659606) We have said how workers can fulfil their pledge and what they should do during the lock out.
('16', 296, 9, 11, 659700) In this leaflet we shall explain how we propose to help them.
('16', 296, 9, 12, 659762) It is our duty to do this.
('16', 296, 10, 13, 659789) LET US STATE, FIRST, WHAT WE CANNOT DO:
('16', 296, 11, 14, 659829) (1) We shall not help the workers in doing anything which is wrong.
('16', 296, 11, 15, 659897) (2) We shall have to abandon the workers and cease helping them if they do anything wrong or make inflated demands or commit violence.
('16', 296, 11, 16, 660032) (3) We can never wish ill to the employers ; in all that we do, we are bound to consider their interests.
('16', 296, 11, 17, 660138) We shall promote the workers’ interest while duly safeguarding the employers.
('16', 296, 12, 18, 660216) NOW ABOUT WHAT WE SHALL DO FOR THE WORKERS:
('16', 296, 13, 19, 660260) (1) We are with the workers so long as they conduct themselves well, as they have done so far.
('16', 296, 13, 20, 660355) (2) We shall do all we can to obtain for them 35 per cent increase in wages.
('16', 296, 13, 21, 660432) (3) We are, as yet, only entreating the employers.
('16', 296, 13, 22, 660483) We have not tried so far to win public sympathy or educate public opinion.
('16', 296, 13, 23, 660558) But we shall be prepared, if the situation demands it, to acquaint the whole of India with the workers’ plight and hope that we shall succeed in obtaining public sympathy for our cause.
('16', 296, 14, 24, 660744) 1 Gandhiji made this observation while commenting on the last paragraph of Leaflet No.

('16', 297, 1, 3, 660987) (5) We are making an effort to inform ourselves of the condition of the workers in its economic, moral and educational aspects.
('16', 297, 1, 4, 661115) We shall show the workers how they may improve their economic condition ; we shall strive to raise their moral level; we shall think out and teach them ways and means of living in cleanliness and we shall work for the intellectual improvement of such of them as live in ignorance.
('16', 297, 2, 5, 661396) (6) We shall not ourselves eat or dress without providing food and clothing to such of the workers as are reduced to destitution in the course of the struggle.
('16', 297, 3, 6, 661556) (7) We shall nurse the sick among them and get for them the services of vaids and doctors.
('16', 297, 4, 7, 661647) We have undertaken this task with a full sense of our responsi bility.
('16', 297, 4, 8, 661718) We consider the workers’ demand to be entirely reasonable and it is because we believe that satisfaction of their demand will even tually serve rather than harm the employers’ interests that we have taken up this cause.

('16', 298, 5, 6, 662445) Your kind letter of the 18th ultimo has been redirected here.
('16', 298, 6, 7, 662507) I have been wandering about in Gujarat attending to one or two rather delicate questions.
('16', 298, 6, 8, 662597) Hence the delay in replying.
('16', 298, 6, 9, 662626) Sir Frank Sly’s version is quite correct and, as soon as the Bill becomes law, I shall endeavour to have the suits withdrawn.
('16', 298, 6, 10, 662752) When we discussed the matter, we had not contemplated legalization of the agreement.
('16', 298, 6, 11, 662837) Now that the enhancements are being legalized, subject to reduction after the year 1325 3, the planters’ protection will not rest solely on my influence with the raiyats.
('16', 298, 6, 12, 663008) I would nevertheless strain every nerve to see that the cases are withdrawn without resort to law.
('16', 298, 6, 13, 663107) There is just a possibility of a few raiyats proving obdurate.

('16', 298, 8, 16, 663550) We referred the matter to Mr. Sly who says that the question of pending suits was discussed at the meeting between the Committee and the representative planters, and that you then agreed on behalf of the raiyats that such suits should be settled in accordance with the terms of the agreement, the raiyats no longer contesting the legality of sharahbeshi and paying the recorded rent in full up to Fasli 1325. Mr. Sly says he is sure that you will support him on this point, and, if so, I would ask you kindly to induce the raiyats to carry out the agreement which you made on their behalf.” 3 Fasli year, the harvest era introduced by Emperor Akbar, equivalent to 1918

('16', 299, 2, 3, 664293) SABARMATI, March 1, 1918
('16', 299, 3, 4, 664318) DEAR FRIEND, Early this morning as I got up, I fell thinking what we were after.
('16', 299, 3, 5, 664399) What would be the issue of what I had been doing ?
('16', 299, 3, 6, 664450) And of what you had been doing ?
('16', 299, 3, 7, 664483) I suppose, if I succeeded, you would accept the workers’ demands; alternatively, if you hold firm till the last, the mill hands will take to other occupations.
('16', 299, 3, 8, 664643) If they go back on their resolve and accept the wages proposed by you, my efforts will have ended in nothing.
('16', 299, 3, 9, 664753) These results, however, have no serious consequences for the people.
('16', 299, 3, 10, 664822) What about your efforts, though?
('16', 299, 3, 11, 664855) If you succeed, the poor, already suppressed, will be suppressed still more, will be more abject than ever and the impression will have been confirmed that money can subdue everyone.
('16', 299, 3, 12, 665038) If, despite your efforts, the workers succeed in securing the increase, you, and others with you, will regard the result as your failure.
('16', 299, 3, 13, 665176) Can I possibly wish you success in so far as the first result is concerned ?
('16', 299, 3, 14, 665253) Is it your desire that the arrogance of money should increase ?
('16', 299, 3, 15, 665317) Or that the workers be reduced to utter submission ?
('16', 299, 3, 16, 665370) Would you be so unkindly disposed to them as to see no success for you in their getting what they are entitled to, may be even a few pice more ?
('16', 299, 3, 17, 665515) Do you not see that in your failure lies your success, that your success is fraught with danger for you ?
('16', 299, 3, 18, 665621) How if Ravana had succeeded ?
('16', 299, 3, 19, 665651) Do you not see that your success will have serious consequences for the whole society ?
('16', 299, 3, 20, 665739) Your efforts are of the nature of duragraha 1. My success everyone will accept as success.
('16', 299, 3, 21, 665830) My failure, too, will not harm anyone ; it will only prove that the workers were not prepared to go farther than they did.
('16', 299, 3, 22, 665953) An effort like mine is satyagraha.
('16', 299, 3, 23, 665988) Kindly look deep into your heart, listen to the still small voice within and obey it, I pray you.
('16', 299, 3, 24, 666086) Will you dine with me?

('16', 299, 4, 27, 666224) The mill owners remained obstinate at this time.
('16', 299, 4, 28, 666273) Mahadev Desai thus analysed the situation: “.
('16', 299, 4, 29, 666319) .it appeared that the non acceptance of the workers’ demand by the employers was not due to their inability to pay 35 per cent, but to sheer obstinacy.
('16', 299, 4, 30, 666471) They had adopted this perverse attitude fearing that if once the workers succeeded, they would be a source of constant nuisance and the advisers of labour would get a permanent footing.”

('16', 300, 3, 4, 666756) Hitherto we have discussed the workers’ pledge and what the workers are to do.
('16', 300, 3, 5, 666835) We have now to declare in writing what our pledge is and what we have decided to do.
('16', 300, 3, 6, 666920) We shall tell you what you should expect from us and what, in the sight of God, we have been planning to do.
('16', 300, 3, 7, 667029) Whenever you see us committing mistakes or slackening in our efforts to carry out our pledge, you can confront us with it and censure us.

('16', 300, 6, 11, 667235) March 2, 1918
('16', 300, 7, 12, 667249) LEAFLET NO.
('16', 300, 7, 13, 667261) 5 We have so far considered the situation from our point of view.
('16', 300, 7, 14, 667327) It is rather difficult to do so from that of the employers Workers’ efforts may have one of these two results: 1. They may get a 35 per cent increase in wages, or 2. They may have to resume work without getting such increase.
('16', 300, 7, 15, 667553) If the workers get an increase, they will be benefited and the employers will have earned credit.
('16', 300, 7, 16, 667651) If they have to resume work without any increase, they will be demoralized and obliged to bow before the employers as so many slaves.
('16', 300, 7, 17, 667785) It is, therefore, in the interests of both sides that the workers get an increase.
('16', 300, 7, 18, 667868) At any rate, a defeat will cost the workers very much indeed.
('16', 300, 7, 19, 667930) Employers’ efforts too may have one of these two results: 1. They may concede the workers an increase.
('16', 300, 7, 20, 668033) 2. They may not do so.
('16', 300, 7, 21, 668056) If the employers concede it, the workers will be contented and justice will have been done to them.
('16', 300, 7, 22, 668156) The employers are afraid that, if the workers’ demands are conceded, they will become overbearing.
('16', 300, 7, 23, 668255) This fear is baseless.
('16', 300, 7, 24, 668278) Even if workers are suppressed today, it is not impossible that, when opportunity arises, they will take to such ways.
('16', 300, 8, 25, 668397) 1 The speech evidently refers to Leaflet No.
('16', 300, 8, 26, 668442) 4 2 The rest of the speech is not available.
('16', 301, 0, 1, 668487) 302 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 301, 1, 2, 668529) is even possible that the workers, on being suppressed, will become vindictive.
('16', 301, 1, 3, 668609) The history of the world shows that, wherever the workers have been suppressed, they have risen in revolt later when they got an opportunity.
('16', 301, 1, 4, 668751) The employers feel that conceding the workers’ demand will strengthen their advisers’ influence on them.
('16', 301, 1, 5, 668856) If the advisers are right in their stand, if they are devoted to the cause, the workers will never leave them whether they are defeated or victorious, and be it noted that the advisers also will not abandon the workers.
('16', 301, 1, 6, 669076) Those who have dedicated themselves to service of others will not forsake it even if they have to incur the displeasure of those whom they oppose.
('16', 301, 1, 7, 669223) The more cause for disappointment they have, the more devoted will they become in their service.
('16', 301, 1, 8, 669320) Strive as they may, the employers will never succeed in dividing the advisers from the workers.
('16', 301, 1, 9, 669416) What, then, will they get by defeating the workers ?
('16', 301, 1, 10, 669469) The only reply can be: nothing but the workers’ discontent.
('16', 301, 1, 11, 669529) The employers will always distrust the suppressed workers.
('16', 301, 1, 12, 669588) By granting the increase as demanded, the employers will have contented workers.
('16', 301, 1, 13, 669669) If the latter fail in their duty, the employers can always rely on the help of the advisers ; this way, they can end the loss now being caused to both sides.
('16', 301, 1, 14, 669827) The workers, on their part, will ever remain grateful if their demand is met and there will be increased goodwill between them and the employers.
('16', 301, 1, 15, 669973) Thus, the employers’ success lies in that of the workers ; and the latter’s defeat, likewise, will be their defeat.
('16', 301, 1, 16, 670089) As against this way of pure justice, the employers have adopted the Western, or the modern, Satanic notion of justice.

('16', 301, 5, 21, 670292) LEAFLET NO.
('16', 301, 5, 22, 670304) 6 Pure justice is that which is inspired by fellow feeling and compassion.
('16', 301, 5, 23, 670379) We in India call it the Eastern or the ancient way of justice.
('16', 301, 5, 24, 670442) That way of justice which has no place in it for fellow feeling
('16', 301, 6, 25, 670506) 1 Leaflets numbered 5 and 8 have been assigned by Mahadev Desai to March 2 and March 5, respectively.
('16', 301, 6, 26, 670608) Leaflets numbered 6 and 7 fall naturally on March 3 and March 4.

('16', 302, 1, 2, 670719) or compassion is known as Satanic, Western or modern justice.
('16', 302, 1, 3, 670781) Out of compassion or regard, son and father concede many things to each other to the eventual benefit of both.
('16', 302, 1, 4, 670892) One takes pride in giving up a claim and thinks of one’s action as proceeding from strength, not weakness.
('16', 302, 1, 5, 670999) There was a time in India when servants, passing from father to son, used to serve in the same family for generations.
('16', 302, 1, 6, 671118) They were regarded and treated as members of the family.
('16', 302, 1, 7, 671175) They suffered with the employers in their misfortunes and the latter shared the servants’ joys and sorrows.
('16', 302, 1, 8, 671283) In those days, India was reputed for a social order free from friction, and this order endured for thousands of years on that basis.
('16', 302, 1, 9, 671416) Even now this sense of fellow feeling is not altogether absent in our country.
('16', 302, 1, 10, 671495) Where such an arrangement exists, there is hardly any need for a third party or an arbitrator.
('16', 302, 1, 11, 671590) Disputes between a master and a servant are settled between themselves amicably.
('16', 302, 1, 12, 671671) There was no room in this arrangement for increase or reduction in wages according as the changing needs of the two might dictate.
('16', 302, 1, 13, 671802) Servants did not ask for higher wages when there was a dearth of servants and masters did not reduce wages when servants were available in plenty.
('16', 302, 1, 14, 671949) This arrangement was based primarily on considerations of mutual regard, propriety, decorum and affection.
('16', 302, 1, 15, 672056) This sense of mutual obligation was not then, as it is now, considered unpractical but ruled us in most of our affairs.
('16', 302, 1, 16, 672176) History records that many great things have been achieved by our people because they had made this pure justice the law of their life.
('16', 302, 1, 17, 672311) This is the Eastern or ancient justice.
('16', 302, 2, 18, 672351) A totally different way of life prevails in the West today.
('16', 302, 2, 19, 672411) It is not to be supposed that all persons in the West approve of the modern idea of justice.
('16', 302, 2, 20, 672504) There are many saintly persons in the West who lead a blameless life, adopting the ancient standard.
('16', 302, 2, 21, 672605) But in most public activities of the West at present, there is no place for fellow feeling or compassion.
('16', 302, 2, 22, 672711) It is considered just that a master pays his servant what he thinks fit.
('16', 302, 2, 23, 672784) It is not considered necessary to think of the servants’ needs.
('16', 302, 2, 24, 672848) So also the worker can make his own demand, irrespective of the employer’s financial condition and this is considered just.
('16', 302, 3, 25, 672972) 1 Mahadev Desai wrote, in regard to these observations: “Gandhiji had published these ideas years ago in Indian Opinion in his article on Sarvodaya based on Ruskin’s book, Unto This Last.
('16', 302, 3, 26, 673160) The same ideas, having matured in course of time, he discussed in these leaflets in simple, direct and forceful language.” Vide “Letter to H.S.L. Polak”, 14 10 1909.
('16', 303, 0, 1, 673326) 304 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 303, 1, 2, 673368) just, they think, that everyone should look after his own interests and expect others to take these into account.
('16', 303, 1, 3, 673482) The present war in Europe is fought on the same principle.
('16', 303, 1, 4, 673541) No means is considered improper for defeating the enemy.
('16', 303, 1, 5, 673598) Wars must have been fought even in the past, but the vast masses of the people were not involved in them.
('16', 303, 1, 6, 673704) We would do well not to introduce into India this despicable idea of justice.
('16', 303, 1, 7, 673782) When workers make a demand merely because they think themselves strong enough to do so, regardless of the employers’ condition, they will have succumbed to the modern, Satanic idea of justice.
('16', 303, 1, 8, 673975) The employers, in refusing to consider the workers’ demands, have accepted this Satanic principle of justice, may be unintentionally or in ignorance.
('16', 303, 1, 9, 674125) The employers ganging up against the workers is like raising an army of elephants against ants.
('16', 303, 1, 10, 674221) If they had any regard for dharma, the employers would hesitate to oppose the workers.
('16', 303, 1, 11, 674308) You will never find in ancient India that a situation in which the workers starved was regarded as the employers’ opportunity.
('16', 303, 1, 12, 674435) That action alone is just which does not harm either party to a dispute.
('16', 303, 1, 13, 674508) We had confidently hoped that the Jain and Vaishnava employers in the capital city of this worthy land of Gujarat would never consider it a victory to bear down the workers or deliberately to give them less than their due.
('16', 303, 1, 14, 674731) We are sure this wind from the West will pass as quickly as it has come.
('16', 303, 1, 15, 674804) At any rate, we do not want to teach the workers what they do in the West these days.
('16', 303, 1, 16, 674890) We wish to follow, and to make the workers follow, our ancient idea of justice as we have known it and to help them in that manner to secure their rights.
('16', 303, 2, 17, 675045) We shall consider, in the next leaflet, some of the evil consequences of the policy followed in the West in modern times.

('16', 304, 3, 4, 675542) MAGANLAL, Santok and Ramdas arrived here yesterday.
('16', 304, 3, 5, 675594) They will leave for Rajkot tomorrow.
('16', 304, 3, 6, 675631) Shri Khushalbhai and Narandas are against letting Krishna and Purushottam go, and so the idea has been given up.
('16', 304, 3, 7, 675744) I too thought they were right.
('16', 304, 3, 8, 675775) If Purushottam goes to Rajkot, we must also let him go to Morabi.
('16', 304, 3, 9, 675841) If Krishna goes to Rajkot this time, we should have to let others, too, go to their own places.
('16', 304, 3, 10, 675937) I thought, therefore, that, though you would have liked them to go, [it would be better] not to let them, especially as the elders, too, were of the same mind ....

('16', 304, 7, 14, 676198) BHAISHRI, .
('16', 304, 7, 15, 676210) We are so terribly anxious to live on that the hour of death—especially of those dear to us—always fills us with fear.
('16', 304, 7, 16, 676329) I, for my part, have always felt that such occasions are in the nature of a real test for us.
('16', 304, 7, 17, 676423) Anyone who is even faintly alive to the reality of the atman understands the true meaning of death.
('16', 304, 7, 18, 676523) Why should such a one grieve needlessly?
('16', 304, 7, 19, 676564) There is nothing new in these thoughts but, if recalled to us in the hour of misfortunes they bring us consolation.
('16', 304, 7, 20, 676680) I state them in the hope that they will do this service to you.

('16', 305, 10, 15, 677489) LEAFLET.
('16', 305, 10, 16, 677498) 7 South Africa is a large British Colony.
('16', 305, 10, 17, 677540) The Europeans have been settled there for over four hundred years.
('16', 305, 10, 18, 677607) They enjoy autonomy.
('16', 305, 10, 19, 677628) Many European workers are employed in the railways of that country.
('16', 305, 10, 20, 677696) These workers felt that they did not receive just wages.
('16', 305, 10, 21, 677753) Instead of merely trying to get their wages increased, they thought of capturing the Government.
('16', 305, 10, 22, 677850) That was unjust; it was Satanic justice.
('16', 305, 10, 23, 677891) It increased the bitterness between the Government and the labour, and the whole of South Africa was in the grip of fear.
('16', 305, 10, 24, 678013) Nobody felt secure.
('16', 305, 10, 25, 678033) Ultimately, there was even open fighting between the parties and some innocent persons were killed.
('16', 305, 10, 26, 678133) The military took over control everywhere.
('16', 305, 10, 27, 678176) Both parties suffered heavily.
('16', 305, 10, 28, 678207) Each desired to defeat the other.
('16', 305, 10, 29, 678241) Neither cared for justice as such.
('16', 305, 10, 30, 678276) Each side magnified the other’s misdeeds.
('16', 305, 10, 31, 678318) Neither had regard for the feelings of the other.
('16', 305, 10, 32, 678368) While this was going on, our workers behaved justly.
('16', 305, 10, 33, 678421) When the railway strike was launched, a strike involving 20,000 Indian workers had already begun.
('16', 305, 10, 34, 678519) We were fighting the Government of that country for justice, pure and simple.
('16', 305, 10, 35, 678597) The weapon our workers employed was satyagraha.
('16', 305, 10, 36, 678645) They did not wish to spite the Government, nor did they

('16', 306, 1, 2, 678802) wish it ill.
('16', 306, 1, 3, 678815) They had no desire to dislodge it.
('16', 306, 1, 4, 678850) The European workers wanted to exploit the strike of the Indians.
('16', 306, 1, 5, 678916) Our workers refused to be exploited.
('16', 306, 1, 6, 678953) They said, “Ours is a satyagraha struggle.
('16', 306, 1, 7, 678996) We do not desire to harass the Government.
('16', 306, 1, 8, 679039) We will, therefore, suspend our struggle while you are fighting.” Accordingly, they called off the strike.
('16', 306, 1, 9, 679146) 1 We may call this true justice.
('16', 306, 1, 10, 679179) Eventually, our workers succeeded and the Government, too, got credit because it did justice by accepting our demands.
('16', 306, 1, 11, 679298) Our workers obeyed sentiment and did not seek to take advantage of the opponent’s embarrassment.
('16', 306, 1, 12, 679395) The end of the struggle saw better mutual regard between the Government and the people and we came to be treated with more respect.
('16', 306, 1, 13, 679527) Thus, a struggle fought on the basis of true justice benefits both sides.
('16', 306, 1, 14, 679601) If we conduct our struggle on the same basis, with a sense of justice, if we bear no malice towards the employers and ask only or what is our right, not only shall we win but there will also be increased goodwill between the workers and the employers.
('16', 306, 1, 15, 679853) Another thing to observe from this instance is that, in satyagraha, both the sides need not be followers of truth.
('16', 306, 1, 16, 679968) Even if one side alone follows it, satyagraha will finally succeed.
('16', 306, 1, 17, 680036) The party, moreover, which fights with bitterness will lose its bitterness when this is not returned by the other side.
('16', 306, 1, 18, 680156) If a man violently swings his hand in the air, he only strains it thereby.
('16', 306, 1, 19, 680231) Similarly, bitterness is fed only by bitterness.
('16', 306, 1, 20, 680280) We may, therefore, rest assured that, if we fight on with firmness and courage, we are bound to win in the end.
('16', 306, 1, 21, 680392) Tomorrow we shall consider some instances of satyagraha.

('16', 306, 4, 25, 680533) Just as our workers did not take advantage of the difficulties of the Government of South Africa, created by the strike of the European workers, but earned praise for themselves by suspending their campaign and thereby helping the Government, in the same way

('16', 307, 3, 5, 681150) March 5, 1918
('16', 307, 4, 6, 681164) LEAFLET NO.
('16', 307, 4, 7, 681176) 8 In this leaflet, we are not going to talk about satyagrahis who have won fame in the world.
('16', 307, 4, 8, 681270) It would be more profitable for us and inspire us with strength to know what suffering common men like ourselves have found it possible to go through.
('16', 307, 4, 9, 681421) Imam Hassan and Hussain were bold and resolute satyagrahis.
('16', 307, 4, 10, 681481) We revere their names, but merely calling their examples to mind does not help us to become satyagrahis.
('16', 307, 4, 11, 681586) We feel that there can be no comparison between our capacity and theirs.
('16', 307, 4, 12, 681659) An equally memorable name is that of the devotee Prahlad.
('16', 307, 4, 13, 681717) But we think that we are not capable of such devotion, resoluteness, love for truth and courage and so, in the end, we remain what we have been.
('16', 307, 4, 14, 681862) Therefore, let us on this occasion think of what other persons like ourselves have done.
('16', 307, 4, 15, 681951) Such a satyagrahi was Hurbatsingh 2. He was an old man of 75 years.
('16', 307, 4, 16, 682019) He had gone to South Africa on a five year contract to work on an agricultural farm on a monthly wage of seven rupees.
('16', 307, 4, 17, 682138) When the strike of 20,000 Indians, referred to in the last leaflet, commenced, he also joined it.
('16', 307, 4, 18, 682236) Some strikers were jailed, and Hurbatsingh was among them.
('16', 307, 4, 19, 682295) His compani ons pleaded with him and said, “It is not for you to plunge into this sea of suffering.
('16', 307, 4, 20, 682395) Jail is not the place for you.
('16', 307, 4, 21, 682426) No one can blame you if you do not join such a struggle.” Hurbatsingh replied: “When all of you suffer so much for our honour, what shall I do by remaining outside?
('16', 307, 4, 22, 682591) What does it matter even if I die in jail?” And, verily, Hurbatsingh died in jail and won undying fame.
('16', 307, 4, 23, 682695) Had he died outside, no one would have noticed his death.
('16', 307, 4, 24, 682753) But, as he died in jail, the Indian community asked for his dead body and hundreds of Indians joined his funeral procession.
('16', 307, 5, 25, 682878) 1 The rest of the speech is not available.

('16', 308, 1, 2, 683154) Like Hurbatsingh, was the Transvaal businessman Ahmed Mahomed Cachalia.
('16', 308, 1, 3, 683226) By the grace of God he is still alive, and lives in South Africa where he looks after the Indian community and safeguards its honour.
('16', 308, 1, 4, 683360) During the struggle in which Hurbatsingh sacrificed his life, Cachalia went to prison several times.
('16', 308, 1, 5, 683461) He allowed his business to be ruined and, though he now lives in poverty, is respected everywhere.
('16', 308, 1, 6, 683560) He saved his honour, though he had to pay heavily for it.
('16', 308, 1, 7, 683618) Just as an old labourer and a middle aged businessman of repute stood by their word and suffered, so also did a girl of seventeen years.
('16', 308, 1, 8, 683755) Her name was Valliamah 1. She also went to jail for the honour of the community during that same struggle.
('16', 308, 1, 9, 683862) She had been suffering from fever when she was imprisoned.
('16', 308, 1, 10, 683921) In jail, the fever became worse.
('16', 308, 1, 11, 683954) The jailer advised her to leave the jail, but Valliamah refused and with an unflinching mind completed her term of imprisonment.
('16', 308, 1, 12, 684083) She died on the fourth or the fifth day after her release from jail.
('16', 308, 1, 13, 684152) The satyagraha of all the three was pure.
('16', 308, 1, 14, 684194) All of them suffered hardships, went to jail but kept their pledge.
('16', 308, 1, 15, 684262) There is no such cloud hanging over us.
('16', 308, 1, 16, 684302) The utmost we have to suffer by keeping our pledge is to give up some of our luxuries and pull on somehow without the wages we earned.
('16', 308, 1, 17, 684437) This is no very great task.
('16', 308, 1, 18, 684465) It should not be difficult for us to do what our own brothers and sisters in our own time have done.
('16', 308, 1, 19, 684566) We shall consider this matter a little further in the next leaflet.

('16', 308, 5, 23, 684717) In going to jail and defying the Government, these three sought nothing for themselves.
('16', 308, 5, 24, 684805) These sisters and brothers of ours did not have to pay the tax.
('16', 308, 5, 25, 684869) Cachalia was a big merchant and did not have to pay it.
('16', 308, 5, 26, 684925) Hurbatsingh had migrated before the tax was imposed, so he, too, did not have to pay it.

('16', 309, 1, 4, 685532) Your struggle, on the other hand, is for your own good.
('16', 309, 1, 5, 685588) It should, therefore, be easier for you to remain firm.

('16', 309, 5, 12, 685792) 9 Yesterday we discussed the examples of three satyagrahis; they were not the only satyagrahis in that struggle.
('16', 309, 5, 13, 685905) Twenty thousand workers were out of work at a time, and the trouble was not over within twelve days.
('16', 309, 5, 14, 686006) The entire struggle lasted for seven years and during that period hundreds of men lived under great suspense and anxiety and stuck to their resolve.
('16', 309, 5, 15, 686155) Twenty thousand workers lived homeless and without wages for three months.
('16', 309, 5, 16, 686230) Many sold whatever goods they had.
('16', 309, 5, 17, 686265) They left their huts, sold their beds and mattresses and cattle and marched forth.
('16', 309, 5, 18, 686348) Hundreds of them marched 20 miles a day for several days, each getting on only on 3/4 lb.
('16', 309, 5, 19, 686438) of flour and an ounce of sugar.
('16', 309, 5, 20, 686470) There were Muslims as well as Hindus among them.
('16', 309, 5, 21, 686519) One of them is the son of the Muezzin of the Jumma Masjid of Bombay.
('16', 309, 5, 22, 686588) His name is Imam Saheb Abdul Kadir Bawazeer 1. He who had never suffered any hardship before endured the rigours of jail life, labouring, during his terms of imprisonment, on cleaning roads, breaking stones, etc., and for months lived on tasteless and simple food.
('16', 309, 5, 23, 686853) At present he has not a pie with him.
('16', 309, 5, 24, 686891) The same is true of Dadamiya Kaji of Surat.
('16', 309, 5, 25, 686935) Two seventeen year old youngsters from Madras, Narayansamy 2 and Nagappen suffered to the utmost and sacrificed their lives, but did not give in.
('16', 309, 5, 26, 687081) In this same struggle, we may note, women who had never done any manual work before went round hawking and laboured as washerwomen in jails.
('16', 309, 5, 27, 687222) Remembering these examples, will any worker among us not be

('16', 310, 1, 3, 687600) In the leaflets issued by the employers, we find that, in their anger, they have said many unworthy things; many things have been exaggerated, maybe unintentionally, and a few twisted.
('16', 310, 1, 4, 687785) We may not meet anger with anger.
('16', 310, 1, 5, 687819) It does not seem right even to correct the mis statements in them.
('16', 310, 1, 6, 687886) It is enough to say that we should not allow ourselves either to be misled or provoked by such statements.
('16', 310, 1, 7, 687993) If the allegations made against the advisers of the workers are true, merely contradicting them here will not prove them false.
('16', 310, 1, 8, 688121) We know that they are untrue but, rather than attempt to prove them so here, we shall rely on our future behaviour to furnish the proof.

('16', 311, 3, 4, 689246) Do by all means come and we shall discuss.
('16', 311, 3, 5, 689289) Meanwhile, we must agree to differ.
('16', 311, 3, 6, 689325) I have come in close touch with both Messrs Pratt and Ghosal and I think I know them.
('16', 311, 3, 7, 689411) I suppose we shall have to [be] content with half your usefulness.
('16', 311, 3, 8, 689478) He who remains sick half the time of his life is only half useful.
('16', 311, 3, 9, 689545) Is he not ?
('16', 311, 3, 10, 689557) You will not do the one thing needful to regain health.

('16', 311, 8, 16, 689737) March 6, 1918
('16', 311, 9, 17, 689751) DEAR MR. GHOSAL, In your Wadthal annawari I observe you have deducted the double crop area.
('16', 311, 9, 18, 689843) Is not this a mistake?
('16', 311, 9, 19, 689866) If five bighas of land is placed under rice cultivation and then under gram and if the rice annawari is five and that of gram four, surely the annawari of the field is not nine as would be the case if you deducted the double crop area.
('16', 311, 10, 20, 690102) I shall thank you to let me have an early reply as I have come to a standstill ill framing my full letter to you which I suggested I would do on my return to Ahmedabad.

('16', 311, 13, 23, 690336) 1 Deodhar, in replying to Gandhiji’s letter of February 26, 1918, had refused to accept the latter’s observations regarding him, and complained of his ill health.
('16', 311, 13, 24, 690499) This was Gandhiji’s rejoinder.
('16', 311, 13, 25, 690530) 2 Regarding this the addressee replied: “We calculate the annawari not by fields but for the whole village.
('16', 311, 13, 26, 690638) Our object is to get at the total crop raised in the village and divide it by the area on which this was raised.
('16', 311, 13, 27, 690751) “According to your argument if a field has a 10 anna kharif crop, and the owner thereafter tried to raise rabi but failed, the anna valuation would be 10 ÷ 2 = 5 for he would claim suspension because he simply tried to do what could not be done.
('16', 311, 13, 28, 690997) Also I do not see why we should divide by 2 when he raised the 2nd crop on the same area with the additional advantage that it involved no extra burden of assessment.”

('16', 312, 2, 4, 691312) If there was any rebuke in its humour, it was due to Mahadev.
('16', 312, 2, 5, 691374) I had no part in it whatever.
('16', 312, 2, 6, 691404) I have had nothing but satisfaction from your work.
('16', 312, 2, 7, 691456) I have never felt dissatisfied.

('16', 312, 4, 11, 691620) March 7, 1918 1
('16', 312, 5, 12, 691636) LEAFLET NO.
('16', 312, 5, 13, 691648) 10 In the situation in which we are placed, it is quite necessary to examine the point mentioned in the preceding leaflet.
('16', 312, 5, 14, 691771) It is just about a fortnight since the lock out commenced, and yet some say that they have no food, others that they cannot even pay rent.
('16', 312, 5, 15, 691910) The houses of most of the workers are found to be in a very unsatisfactory condition.
('16', 312, 5, 16, 691996) They are without proper ventilation.
('16', 312, 5, 17, 692033) The structures are very old.
('16', 312, 5, 18, 692062) The surroundings are filthy.
('16', 312, 5, 19, 692091) The clothes of the workers are dirty.
('16', 312, 5, 20, 692129) Some wear such clothes because they cannot afford to pay the washerman, others say that they cannot afford soap.
('16', 312, 5, 21, 692242) The workers’ children just play about in the streets.
('16', 312, 5, 22, 692296) They go without schooling.
('16', 312, 5, 23, 692323) Some of the workers even set their tender children to work for money.
('16', 312, 5, 24, 692393) Such extreme poverty is a painful thing indeed.
('16', 312, 5, 25, 692441) But a 35 per cent increase will not by itself cure it.
('16', 312, 5, 26, 692496) Even if wages were to be doubled, in all likelihood the abject poverty would remain unless other measures were also adopted.
('16', 312, 5, 27, 692621) There are many causes for this poverty.
('16', 312, 5, 28, 692661) We shall consider some of them today.
('16', 312, 5, 29, 692699) Questioning the workers, we learn that when they are short of money they pay interest ranging from one anna to four annas per rupee per month.
('16', 312, 5, 30, 692842) The very thought of this makes one shudder.
('16', 312, 5, 31, 692886) Anyone who agrees to pay such interest even once will find it extremely difficult to extricate himself.
('16', 312, 5, 32, 692990) Let us consider this a little.
('16', 312, 5, 33, 693021) Interest on sixteen rupees at one anna per rupee
('16', 312, 6, 34, 693070) 1 Vide the concluding sentence in Leaflet No.9.
('16', 313, 0, 1, 693118) 314 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 313, 1, 2, 693160) is one rupee.
('16', 313, 1, 3, 693174) People who pay interest at this rate pay an amount equivalent to the principal in one year and four months.
('16', 313, 1, 4, 693282) This amounts to 75 per cent interest.
('16', 313, 1, 5, 693320) Even twelve to sixteen per cent interest is considered exorbitant; how, then, can a man paying 75 per cent interest survive at all?
('16', 313, 1, 6, 693452) Then, what shall we say of a man who pays four annas a month on a rupee?
('16', 313, 1, 7, 693525) Such a person pays an amount equal to the principal in four months.
('16', 313, 1, 8, 693593) This amounts to 300 per cent interest.
('16', 313, 1, 9, 693632) People who pay interest at such rates are always in debt and are never able to extricate themselves.
('16', 313, 1, 10, 693733) Prophet Mahomed had realized the crushing burden of interest and so it is that we find in the Holy Koran strict injunctions against charging interest.
('16', 313, 1, 11, 693884) For similar reasons, the rule of damdupat 1 must have been prescribed in the Hindu scriptures.
('16', 313, 1, 12, 693979) If, as part of the present struggle all workers take an oath not to pay such excessive interest, they will have an unbearable burden lifted from them.
('16', 313, 1, 13, 694130) Nobody should pay interest at a rate higher than twelve per cent.
('16', 313, 1, 14, 694196) Some may say: “It is all right for the future, but how shall we pay back what we have already borrowed on interest?
('16', 313, 1, 15, 694312) We have this thing with us for a lifetime now.” The best way out of this situation is to start co operative credit societies of workers.
('16', 313, 1, 16, 694449) We found some workers in a position to rescue their brethren who were being crushed under the weight of interest.
('16', 313, 1, 17, 694563) Outsiders are not likely to take a hand in this.
('16', 313, 1, 18, 694612) Only those who trust us will help us.
('16', 313, 1, 19, 694650) The workers should risk everything to free themselves from this scourge.
('16', 313, 1, 20, 694723) Paying such high rates of interest is a major cause of poverty.
('16', 313, 1, 21, 694787) Probably all other causes count for less.
('16', 313, 1, 22, 694829) We shall discuss this point later.

('16', 313, 4, 28, 695045) It seems so big to me that, for the present, it is beyond my capacity.
('16', 313, 4, 29, 695116) It is not either that I have not thought about it.
('16', 313, 4, 30, 695167) I have decided to leave it alone after full deliberation.
('16', 313, 4, 31, 695225) Possibly, it is weakness on my part to have done so.
('16', 313, 4, 32, 695278) In that case, I need strength
('16', 313, 5, 33, 695308) 1 This stipulated that the interest should not be more than twice the principal.

('16', 314, 4, 8, 695620) BHAI PRANJIVAN, Be the outcome in the Kheda District what it may, the officials and the people are having a good education.
('16', 314, 4, 9, 695744) There has been a tremendous awakening among the people.
('16', 314, 4, 10, 695800) It was disloyalty even to talk of non payment of taxes, but now people speak of it without fear.
('16', 314, 4, 11, 695897) Those among the educated, who have been working as volunteers, have also immensely benefited.
('16', 314, 4, 12, 695991) Men who had never seen a village got an opportunity now and went round nearly 600 villages.
('16', 314, 4, 13, 696083) The Kheda matter is still not off our hands.
('16', 314, 4, 14, 696128) Something of the same kind is going on between the workers and the mill owners.
('16', 314, 4, 15, 696208) I find myself being drawn into every field of Indian life.
('16', 314, 4, 16, 696267) It is no small thing that, without our having to spend a single rupee, 10,000 labourers have remained peaceful; this is a fact.
('16', 314, 4, 17, 696395) People have realized that there is nothing like self help.
('16', 314, 4, 18, 696454) In both these matters, success lies along the lines summed up in these two slogans: “You will win by your own strength, not ours”, and “You will not win except through suffering deliberately endured.”
('16', 314, 5, 19, 696655) X X X Whether it is good or bad for you to expand your business 1
('16', 314, 6, 20, 696721) depends solely on the end in view.
('16', 314, 6, 21, 696756) There is no depending on one’s life.
('16', 314, 6, 22, 696793) One may earn money to be able to do good, but, if death comes meanwhile, one would die full of regrets [over things undone].
('16', 314, 6, 23, 696918) If, on the other hand, making money is your only aim, if that is regarded as a good thing in itself, or, if it is believed that one should go on expanding one’s business as a matter of duty just to make it more profitable, you must need expand it.

('16', 315, 9, 22, 698158) DEAR MR. GHOSAL, I had a visit early this morning from some of the Kathana cultivators.
('16', 315, 9, 23, 698246) They brought with them a batch of chothai notices.
('16', 315, 9, 24, 698297) I was somewhat taken aback as I had felt that even though you might insist upon collection, no chothai or khalsa orders would be issued.
('16', 315, 9, 25, 698434) I have no justification for this except the feeling that as you permitted me to continue my negotiations about the crops in Kaira District no coercion would be used even it finally collection was decided upon where postponement was urged.
('16', 315, 9, 26, 698673) I have therefore telegraphed appealing for cancellation of the orders above referred to.
('16', 315, 9, 27, 698762) I hope my

('16', 316, 1, 2, 698834) appeal will have a favourable reception from you.
('16', 316, 1, 3, 698884) I have taken the liberty, too, as the matter is so very important, of sending a telegram to the Secretariat at Bombay.
('16', 316, 1, 4, 699003) I now come to Wadthal.
('16', 316, 1, 5, 699026) I thank you for your letter in reply to my query as to the deduction of double cropped area.
('16', 316, 1, 6, 699119) If for a field which normally grew a kharif as well as a rabi crop the assessment was based on this fact, in my opinion the crop would be only 16 annas for that field or a group of similar fields in a village, if it gave 16 annas both of kharif and rabi.
('16', 316, 2, 7, 699374) The process of deducting the double cropped area could only be justified if you held that the field that gave 16 annas of kharif crop should be estimated to have given more than 16 annas to the extent of its rabi crop thus leading to the reductio ad absurdum suggested by my letter of the 6th instant.
('16', 316, 3, 8, 699676) I wholly accept the argument that in finding the annawari there can be no fieldwise calculation except as a sample.
('16', 316, 3, 9, 699792) And on that ground I venture to suggest that the rabi crop as a rule ought not to be taken into consideration, because it is not a general crop.
('16', 316, 3, 10, 699937) If 90 fields of every 100 grow only a kharif crop and have no rabi and if the rabi crop, where grown be 16 annas, it would be a false average annawari for the hundred fields if the rabi crop for the purpose of annawari is a negligible quantity.
('16', 316, 3, 11, 700182) The staple crops are undoubtedly kharif crops and in my humble opinion, agriculturists get less than justice when in order to collect revenue assessments annawari is forced up by taking the rabi into account.
('16', 316, 3, 12, 700391) Indeed my observations supported by my fellow workers now cover nearly 350 villages and they lead me to think that the cultivators pay their assessment from the kharif crops and not out of the rabi.
('16', 316, 3, 13, 700590) No intelligent observer can escape noticing as he passes from field to field that the rabi crops are like an oasis in a big desert.
('16', 316, 3, 14, 700722) It may be added that not all the fields of individual cultivators can be laid under rabi cultivation.
('16', 316, 3, 15, 700824) The season and crop report for the year 1914 15 shows that the rabi crop was only a twelfth and for 1915 16 twentieth of all the other crops.
('16', 316, 3, 16, 700966) I would venture to suggest too that crops such as spices, vegetables, variali, etc., which are grown only by a few cultivators ought not to be taken into account.
('16', 316, 3, 17, 701129) I would put cotton, too, in the same category until it becomes a general crop among the agriculturists.
('16', 316, 3, 18, 701233) It would be obviously unfair to put up the annawari of the village because a big land holder carrying on bold
('16', 317, 0, 1, 701343) 318 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 317, 1, 2, 701385) experiments has succeeded in growing special crops.
('16', 317, 1, 3, 701437) I desire, too, to protest against the strip grass being included in the calculation.
('16', 317, 1, 4, 701522) I am told that it is not usual to sell this grass, but that people have as a matter of necessity to keep the borders to allow their cattle to turn about at the end of every journey from one direction to the other.
('16', 317, 1, 5, 701736) If the object of arriving at the annawari, viz., relief to the average cultivator if his crops have not yielded .
('16', 317, 1, 6, 701850) 1 be kept steadily in view, I submit that this argument would appear to be unanswerable.
('16', 317, 1, 7, 701939) I had indeed begged of you to visit Wadhal and test the valuation for yourself.
('16', 317, 1, 8, 702019) But I had at the same time begged that I should accompany you.
('16', 317, 1, 9, 702082) I would then have been able to place before you the cultivators’ standpoint as I had seen it.
('16', 317, 1, 10, 702176) For instance, I would certainly have matched Mr. Muljibhai Amin’s testimony and shown that his could well be treated as biased.
('16', 317, 1, 11, 702304) I would have brought you face to face with the...
('16', 317, 1, 12, 702354) who would have told you that the annawari arrived at by them was 3 during the month of December last.
('16', 317, 1, 13, 702456) I would have got the people to produce for your inspection juvar pods in abundance to show you that they were not only eaten up by rats but that they were attacked by some serious disease.
('16', 317, 1, 14, 702645) The juvar in some of the fields does indeed look tall and majestic, but an examination of the pods tells a different tale.
('16', 317, 1, 15, 702768) It gives me pleasure to confess that you have bestowed much pains on the production of your report.
('16', 317, 1, 16, 702868) But I respectfully submit that based as it is originally upon the Mamlatdar’s figure its does [not] do sufficient justice to the cultivators.
('16', 317, 1, 17, 703010) In my humble opinion the mamlatdar’s annawari is totally at variance with the almost universal testimony of the villagers some of whom have a reputation to lose.
('16', 317, 1, 18, 703172) It is impossible for me to impute either untrustworthiness to them or thoughtlessness.
('16', 317, 1, 19, 703259) I am strongly supported in my view by Mr. Batukshanker of Nadiad who is himself a considerable land holder and who is one of the most respectable straightforward men in the Kaira District.
('16', 317, 1, 20, 703448) He has not said anything about Wadthal but his land is in a condition no less advantageous than the best in Wadthal and yet his annawari brings him under the suspension rules.
('16', 317, 1, 21, 703624) I cannot help remarking that your annawari of tuwar, kodra, rice, bavte, sherian tobacco, divela and gram is too high.
('16', 317, 1, 22, 703743) I venture to suggest they are.

('16', 318, 1, 2, 703922) under the suspension rules.
('16', 318, 1, 3, 703950) And if you accept my submission that only the staple crops should be values retention of your annawari in respect of them brings the average to less than 6. Again if the double cropped area were not deducted the annawari would be less than 6 retaining.
('16', 318, 1, 4, 704203) 1 figures.
('16', 318, 1, 5, 704214) Thirdly, if the rabi crops and the uncommon crops were exempted from the calculation as submitted by me the annawari would be under 6. I have before me a list carefully prepared in consultation with the villagers giving the actual yield of all the crops and the normal yield.
('16', 318, 1, 6, 704490) It will be admitted that if the figures are correct it will be the most absolute test.
('16', 318, 1, 7, 704577) The annawari for this village arrived at by this process is 2.7. I adhere to my suggestion that the rabi crop including the other standing crop can be easily utilized for testing the accuracy of the figures given by the cultivators.
('16', 318, 1, 8, 704810) I have suggested to the people of Wadthal that they should not remove the standing crops from the threshing floors except after duly weighing them in the presence of independent witnesses.
('16', 318, 1, 9, 704999) I venture to submit that it is worth while your testing the Wadthal crops in this fashion.
('16', 318, 2, 10, 705090) Might I also draw your attention to the fact that the annawari for the kharif crops arrived at by the Ho.
('16', 318, 2, 11, 705196) Messrsn.
('16', 318, 2, 12, 705205) Gokuldas Parekh and Patel and also Mr. Deolker and his party was under 4 annas.
('16', 318, 2, 13, 705285) So that if my contention about the kharif crops be accepted for purposes of inding the true annawari, you have the results of my investigation for nearly 350 villages corroborated by two other independent investiga tions.
('16', 318, 2, 14, 705507) You will observe that my investigation embraces all the talukas and covers a large number of villages in each taluka, and I have no hesitation in asking for full suspension in respect of all but a few of .
('16', 318, 2, 15, 705713) 2 cases the first instalment have already been paid and here I wish parenthetically to draw attention to the fact that in some villages even though half suspension orders were issued both instalments were collected from small holders.
('16', 318, 2, 16, 705948) I therefore suggest that the villages where the first instalment had already been received, suspension order should be issued for the second instalment.
('16', 318, 2, 17, 706101) Though you may be precluded from considering any cause for granting suspension other than the failure of crops to the extent of 12 annas I would suggest for the consideration of the Government the fact that the people of the District have been hardest hit perhaps by the plague which is raginlg furiously in it, which has decimated many a home and which has

('16', 319, 1, 2, 706539) driven many people from their houses on to temporary grass structures, built at, for them, considerable expense.
('16', 319, 1, 3, 706652) In my humble opinion, your argument about the high prices is not fair to the people.
('16', 319, 1, 4, 706737) It is common cause between us that last year has been very poor for the cultivators.
('16', 319, 1, 5, 706822) They have not certainly had much grain for sale.
('16', 319, 1, 6, 706871) Whilst therefore they have been considerably disadvantaged by them as they had to buy food and clothing.
('16', 319, 1, 7, 706976) Taking therefore everything into consideration even if full suspension be not granted I hope that the Government will be pleased to grant at least half suspension in every case, and if these orders are passed I shall try my utmost to secure without coercion payment of the first instalment from the villages which have hitherto held out.
('16', 319, 2, 8, 707314) There still remains the case of the Daskroi villages.
('16', 319, 2, 9, 707368) There can be no doubt whatsoever that flood did an irreparable damage to their crops and they are entitled to relief under the Local Calamities section.
('16', 319, 2, 10, 707521) You were pleased to tell me that you were not inclined to grant suspension where the cultivators had grown rabi crops.
('16', 319, 2, 11, 707640) I repeat what I submitted to you at the interview that if you exempt from suspension orders those who have grown rabi crops you would be punishing industry.
('16', 319, 2, 12, 707797) They have told me and I believe their statement that those who have grown rabi are actually out of pocket and are therefore worse off than those who never grow it at all.
('16', 319, 2, 13, 707968) I have inspected the rabi crop and I have no hesitation in saying that though the patches of green look tempting to the eye, closer inspection shows that the crops are diseased and will yield very little and in any case I presume you will admit that it is only on limited areas that the occupants have grown rabi crop on their fields.
('16', 319, 3, 14, 708303) I admit that the Kaira District is naturally “rich and prosperous”, its cattle are in a good condition, it has great wealth in its majestic trees.
('16', 319, 3, 15, 708450) But I fear very much that the District has been progressively going down in prosperity.
('16', 319, 3, 16, 708538) Their ill kept, dilapidated houses, their empty barns, and probably the awful destruction that is going on of trees and evidence I possess of the sale of their cattle unmistakably point to the decline in their prosperity.
('16', 319, 3, 17, 708760) A few more lean years can certainly undo this fair land.
('16', 319, 4, 18, 708817) I do not know how far the failure of crops is responsible for the destruction of mohwa trees and how far it is due to the Mohwa Act and how far it is due to the greed to get high prices for coal and wood, for both of which the Mohwa tree is so handy.
('16', 319, 4, 19, 709068) Whatever may be the

('16', 320, 1, 2, 709134) cause I do hope that the Government will remove from the people at least for the time being the fear of the Mohwa Act.
('16', 320, 1, 3, 709253) I wish further to suggest that during the summer season and during the monsoon hundreds of people in the District would be hard put to it for food and it would be an act of simple justice to permit the fullest use of Mohwa flowers for their food.
('16', 320, 1, 4, 709500) It would be cruelty to enforce the Act during this year.
('16', 320, 1, 5, 709557) To recapitulate, (a) In my opinion by a variety of ways your minimum annawari for Wadthal has been successfully challenged and it is less than 4 annas; the case for the large majority of the villages in the District is similar to Wadthal and therefore the cultivators are entitled to full suspension;
('16', 320, 2, 6, 709858) (b) If however my suggestion as to annawari be not accepted l pray that the Government may be pleased to grant half suspension all round in view (1) of the admittedly partial failure of crops and (2) of the distress caused amongst the people by the plague and the high prices, and if this relief is granted I am prepared to advise holders of sanadia lands and others who are well off to pay both the instalments voluntarily.
('16', 320, 2, 7, 710283) This will confine the relief only to those who are in actual distress;
('16', 320, 3, 8, 710354) (c) For Daskroi villages over and above the relief by way of suspension, the Local Calamities section should be fully applied to them;
('16', 320, 4, 9, 710489) (d) The operation of the known Act should be suspended and the fact widely made known to the people so that in so far as the Act is an inducement to cut down the trees they may be saved, and so that they may be enabled to make use of Mohwa flowers for food.
('16', 320, 4, 10, 710747) May I request you to pass this letter on to the Government with, if possible, favourable recommendation from you.

('16', 321, 3, 4, 711083) DEAR MR. GHOSAL, A correspondent has sent from Borsad a printed form which purports to be an admission as to the estimate of standing crops and an admission that the crop is enough to pay the Government dues.
('16', 321, 3, 5, 711292) I cannot help saying that the form is most unfair to the people.
('16', 321, 3, 6, 711357) They ought not to be called upon to sign any such document.

('16', 321, 9, 14, 711756) DEAR MR. CRERAR, In the hope that His excellency is now able to attend to public business with undue strain on him, I am addressing this communication to you.
('16', 321, 9, 15, 711915) I do however feel ashamed that I should be at all a cause of adding to His Excellency’s many anxieties.
('16', 321, 9, 16, 712019) I would certainly have refrained if I could have helped it.
('16', 321, 9, 17, 712079) I beg to enclose herewith a copy of my letter to the Collector of Kaira District.
('16', 321, 9, 18, 712161) I am awaiting his reply.
('16', 321, 9, 19, 712186) I have personally visited over thirty villages in the various talukas and I must confess that the universal cry is that the crops have been largely a failure.
('16', 321, 9, 20, 712345) It is impossible therefore to think that all the men are determined to tell an untruth.
('16', 321, 9, 21, 712433) What is more, the crops still standing confirm the popular view.
('16', 321, 9, 22, 712498) If they yield a poor return the kharif crops already cut must have been poorer still.
('16', 321, 9, 23, 712584) For it is admitted that the rabi crops and the longer living kharif are better

('16', 322, 1, 2, 712900) than the crops already harvested.
('16', 322, 1, 3, 712934) In the circumstances I have not hesitated to tell the people that they need not voluntarily pay their vigoti but should allow the officials to sell their belongings.
('16', 322, 1, 4, 713100) I have been invited to make a public statement but have declined to do so pending negotiations with the Government for a settlement.
('16', 322, 1, 5, 713233) I have declined too to issue notices to the people giving general advice.
('16', 322, 1, 6, 713307) And I am hoping that if the evidence of my colleagues and myself is not accepted, if even the prevalence of the plague is not accepted as in itself a sufficient excuse for postponing collection as required by me, a joint inquiry might be held.
('16', 322, 1, 7, 713551) But [if] even the last request is rejected there is for me no recourse left open but to generally advise the cultivators to refuse to pay the revenue dues 1 and to allow their belongings to be sold or confiscated and to issue a public appeal for support of their attitude.
('16', 322, 1, 8, 713824) In my humble opinion it is better that the people in a dignified and respectful manner disobey the Government orders and knowingly suffer in their own person the consequences of their disobedience than that disappointment should deepen into secretdiscontent.
('16', 322, 1, 9, 714083) I had promised that I would humbly lay before His Excellency my view on the situation before taking any extreme steps.
('16', 322, 1, 10, 714202) I hope that my submission will receive His Excellency’s due consideration.
('16', 322, 1, 11, 714277) I shall gladly wait on His Excellency should my presence be desired.

('16', 323, 10, 14, 715283) As days pass, leaflets misleading the workers continue to be issued.
('16', 323, 10, 15, 715352) It is also rumoured that the lock out is to be lifted on Tuesday, and that those workers who return will be taken back.
('16', 323, 10, 16, 715472) We hear, besides, that any worker who persuades five or more other workers to go with him will be given a reward.
('16', 323, 10, 17, 715586) Nothing needs to be done to counter these tactics.
('16', 323, 10, 18, 715637) Employers are entitled to get the workers back to work by employing others to persuade them.
('16', 323, 10, 19, 715730) But what is the workers’ duty?
('16', 323, 10, 20, 715761) They have stated that an increase of 20 per cent is not adequate and have given notices accordingly.
('16', 323, 10, 21, 715862) They have taken an oath not to accept anything less than 35 per cent.
('16', 323, 10, 22, 715932) Placed in this predicament, unless a 35 per cent increase is granted, the workers cannot return to work except by violating their pledge, their honour and their manliness.
('16', 323, 10, 23, 716104) It is possible, however, that every worker may not have such a sense of honour.
('16', 323, 10, 24, 716184) Some may not even have taken such a pledge.
('16', 323, 10, 25, 716228) A few hail from outside Gujarat and they may not even be attending meetings.
('16', 323, 10, 26, 716305) It would be wrong even for such workers to go back to work with a 20 per cent increase.
('16', 323, 10, 27, 716393) Our duty merely is to find out such unthinking workers and acquaint them with the true state of affairs.

('16', 324, 2, 3, 716787) Tomorrow, i.e., on Tuesday 1, we are to meet at 7.30 in the morning at the usual place.
('16', 324, 2, 4, 716875) The best way not to be tempted by the employers’ reopening the mills is to attend the meeting as usual at 7.30 in the morning.
('16', 324, 2, 5, 717002) You should also search out the workers from other parts of the country who live as strangers to you and who have hitherto not attended these meetings, and see that they attend them.
('16', 324, 2, 6, 717184) In these days, when you are facing a temptation, all manner of thoughts will occur to you.
('16', 324, 2, 7, 717275) It is a miserable thing for a working man to be without a job.
('16', 324, 2, 8, 717338) The meetings will keep up the patience of all workers who feel so.
('16', 324, 2, 9, 717405) For those who know their strength, there can be no enforced unemployment.
('16', 324, 2, 10, 717479) In reality the worker can be so independent that, if he realizes his true worth, he will never worry about losing a job.
('16', 324, 2, 11, 717600) The wealth of a rich person may disappear or be stolen or be lost in a moment by mismanagement.
('16', 324, 2, 12, 717696) Thanks to miscalculation, a rich man may have to face bankruptcy.
('16', 324, 2, 13, 717762) But a worker’s capital is inexhaustible, incapable of being stolen, and bound to pay him a generous dividend all the time.
('16', 324, 2, 14, 717885) His hands and feet, the energy which enables him to work, constitute this inexhaustible capital of his and the wages constitute his dividends.
('16', 324, 2, 15, 718028) The worker who invests more of his energy in work can easily earn more interest.
('16', 324, 2, 16, 718109) An idle worker will certainly starve.
('16', 324, 2, 17, 718147) Such a one may have reason for despair.
('16', 324, 2, 18, 718187) The industrious has no reason to worry even for a moment.
('16', 324, 2, 19, 718245) Let everyone be at the usual place in time on Tuesday and there you will learn better yet how independent you really are.

('16', 325, 6, 22, 719535) I would certainly do so if I could, even at the cost of my life.
('16', 325, 6, 23, 719600) But that is not possible.
('16', 325, 6, 24, 719626) It is in the hands of the mill owners to bring it to an end.
('16', 325, 6, 25, 719687) Why make it a point of prestige not to give 35 per cent because the workers have asked for it?
('16', 325, 6, 26, 719782) Why is it taken for granted that I can get the workers to accept anything I want?
('16', 325, 6, 27, 719864) I claim that the workers are under my control because of the means I have adopted.

('16', 326, 1, 2, 720422) Shall I now see to it that they break their pledge?
('16', 326, 1, 3, 720474) If I do so, why should they not sever my head from my shoulders?
('16', 326, 1, 4, 720539) I hear that the mill owners find fault with me.
('16', 326, 1, 5, 720587) I am unconcerned.
('16', 326, 1, 6, 720605) Some day they themselves will admit that I was not in the wrong.
('16', 326, 1, 7, 720670) There can be no bitterness between them and me, since I am not going to be a party to any bitterness.
('16', 326, 1, 8, 720772) Even bitterness needs encouragement; it won’t get any from me.
('16', 326, 1, 9, 720835) But why don’t you participate in this?
('16', 326, 1, 10, 720874) It does not become you merely to watch this great struggle unconcernedly.

('16', 326, 3, 13, 721014) [March 12, 1918] 1
('16', 326, 4, 14, 721033) LEAFLET NO.
('16', 326, 4, 15, 721045) 12 Today a new chapter begins.
('16', 326, 4, 16, 721076) The employers have decided to withdraw the lock out and have expressed their willingness to take back those who are ready to accept a 20 per cent increase.
('16', 326, 4, 17, 721232) This means that today the employers’ lock out.
('16', 326, 4, 18, 721279) is at an end and a workers’ strike has commenced.
('16', 326, 4, 19, 721329) You have all seen the announce ment of the employers’ resolution to this effect.
('16', 326, 4, 20, 721410) They say in it that many workers are ready to resume work but could not do so owing to the lock out.
('16', 326, 4, 21, 721511) The information which the employers have received ill accords with the daily meetings of the workers and the oath they have taken.
('16', 326, 4, 22, 721642) Either their information is true or the presence of the workers in the daily meetings and the oath they have taken are a fact.
('16', 326, 4, 23, 721769) The workers bore all these things in mind before taking the pledge and now they cannot resume work without securing a 35 per cent increase, whatever the inducement held out and whatever the suffering they may have to go through.
('16', 326, 4, 24, 721998) Their honour is at stake in this.
('16', 326, 4, 25, 722032) If you weigh a pledge against a sum of hundreds of thousands, the pledge will be seen to be of greater consequence.
('16', 326, 4, 26, 722148) We are sure the workers will never forget this.
('16', 326, 4, 27, 722196) They have no other way to advance themselves except to stand by their oath and it is our conviction that, if only the employers realize it, their welfare too lies in the workers’ keeping their oath.
('16', 326, 4, 28, 722395) Eventually, even the employers will not gain by taking work from workers who are too weak to keep their oath.
('16', 326, 4, 29, 722505) A religiously minded person will
('16', 326, 5, 30, 722538) 1 The lock out was lifted on March 12, 1918.
('16', 327, 0, 1, 722583) 328 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 327, 1, 2, 722625) never feel happy in forcing a person to break his pledge or associating himself with such an effort.
('16', 327, 1, 3, 722726) We have, however, no time now to think of the employers’ duty.
('16', 327, 1, 4, 722789) They know it all right.
('16', 327, 1, 5, 722813) We can only entreat them.
('16', 327, 1, 6, 722839) But the workers must think seriously what their duty is at this time.
('16', 327, 1, 7, 722909) Never again will they get an opportunity like the present one.
('16', 327, 1, 8, 722972) Let us consider what the workers are likely to gain by breaking their oath.
('16', 327, 1, 9, 723048) These days, any honest person in India can earn twenty to twenty five rupees a month by intelligent work.
('16', 327, 1, 10, 723154) The worst that can happen to a worker is that his employers may dismiss him and he will have to look for other work.
('16', 327, 1, 11, 723271) A thoughtful worker should realize that he will get work anywhere after a few days’ search.
('16', 327, 1, 12, 723363) We are sure, however, that the employers do not want to take this extreme step.
('16', 327, 1, 13, 723443) If workers are firm in their resolve, even the hardest of hearts will relent.
('16', 327, 1, 14, 723521) It is possible that the workers from outside Gujarat (i.e., those from the North or the South) are not well informed about this struggle.
('16', 327, 1, 15, 723659) In public work we do not, and do not wish to, make distinctions of Hindu, Muslim, Gujarati, Madrasi, Punjabi, etc.
('16', 327, 1, 16, 723774) We are all one or wish to be one.
('16', 327, 1, 17, 723808) We should, therefore, approach these workers with understanding and enlighten them about the struggle and make them see that it is to their advantage, too, to identify themselves with the rest of us.

('16', 327, 3, 20, 724087) March 12, 1918
('16', 327, 4, 21, 724102) I got your letter.
('16', 327, 4, 22, 724121) I have destroyed it after reading it.
('16', 327, 4, 23, 724159) I never wished that there should be any pressure on the workers.
('16', 327, 4, 24, 724224) If you send more details about who is bringing it on them, I will certainly look into the matter.
('16', 327, 4, 25, 724322) It is all the same to me whether the mill hands resume work or not.
('16', 327, 4, 26, 724390) I have always given instructions not to use force to prevent any worker from going to his mill.
('16', 327, 4, 27, 724486) I have certainly no desire that a labourer should be forced against his will to keep away from it.
('16', 327, 5, 28, 724585) 1 Mahadev Desai notes in the Diary that Gandhiji did not want a copy of this letter to be preserved, even in the Diary, but that he did not mind his summarizing it from memory.

('16', 328, 1, 2, 724808) I am even ready, myself, to escort any worker who says he wants to attend the mill.
('16', 328, 1, 3, 724892) I am altogether indifferent whether a labourer joins or does not join.
('16', 328, 1, 4, 724963) In view of the task you have set me, how can I accept the pleasure of staying with you?
('16', 328, 1, 5, 725051) I should very much like to see your children.
('16', 328, 1, 6, 725097) How is that possible at present, though?
('16', 328, 1, 7, 725138) Let us leave it to the future.

('16', 328, 4, 11, 725263) LEAFLET NO.
('16', 328, 5, 12, 725275) Rumours are afloat that many workers are willing to resume work, but that others prevent them by coercion and threats of physical assault.
('16', 328, 5, 13, 725414) Workers should remember our pledge that, if they bring pressure to bear on their fellows and use threats to stop them from going to work, we shall not find it possible to help them.
('16', 328, 5, 14, 725596) In this struggle, he alone will win who keeps his pledge.
('16', 328, 5, 15, 725654) No one can be forced to do this.
('16', 328, 5, 16, 725687) It is essentially a voluntary matter.
('16', 328, 5, 17, 725725) We want to be faithful to our pledge and go ahead.
('16', 328, 5, 18, 725776) If a man, being afraid, ventures nothing, he can never advance.
('16', 328, 5, 19, 725840) Such a one has lost everything.
('16', 328, 5, 20, 725872) Let every worker, therefore, bear in mind that he is not to use pressure on others in any form or manner.
('16', 328, 5, 21, 725978) If coercion is used, the whole struggle is likely to be weakened and will collapse.
('16', 328, 5, 22, 726062) For the success of their struggle, the workers are to rely solely on the rightness of their demand and of their conduct.
('16', 328, 5, 23, 726183) If their demand is unjust, they cannot succeed.
('16', 328, 5, 24, 726231) The demand may be just.
('16', 328, 5, 25, 726255) But even then the worker will lose his case despite all his suffering if, in securing it, he resorts to untruth or falsehood, to violence or coercion, or is apathetic.
('16', 328, 5, 26, 726423) It is very essential in this struggle that workers do not resort to coercion and that they provide for their maintenance by putting in physical labour.

('16', 329, 2, 3, 726758) March 13, 1918
('16', 329, 3, 4, 726773) I cannot do full justice, nor can anyone else for that matter, I am sure, to the task of introducing Mrs. Besant.
('16', 329, 3, 5, 726887) I have known her for thirty years, having followed her activities since my youth, though of course I cannot claim that she has known me so long.
('16', 329, 3, 6, 727032) “Home Rule” has become a household word all over India, in places big and small; the credit for this goes to this lady.
('16', 329, 3, 7, 727152) I have often said that there have been, and there may still be, differences between her and me; there are quite a few even today.
('16', 329, 3, 8, 727282) If I had the Home Rule movement under my charge, I would go to work differently.
('16', 329, 3, 9, 727363) Having said this, I admit I cannot but look up to her with reverence, honour her, pay tribute to her for her excellent qualities, for she has dedicated her very soul to India.
('16', 329, 3, 10, 727539) She lives only for India to live thus is her sole aspiration.
('16', 329, 3, 11, 727601) No matter if she commits hundreds of mistakes, we shall honour her.
('16', 329, 3, 12, 727669) In my view, Ahmedabad has covered itself with unsurpassed honour by honouring one who has rendered such great services as she has.
('16', 329, 3, 13, 727800) With regard to the subject of today’s address, it seems the present audience is not likely to be much interested in it.
('16', 329, 3, 14, 727920) Mrs. Besant told me a moment ago that she might manage to speak on swaraj before you, but that she wondered what she could say on national education.
('16', 329, 3, 15, 728070) There are not enough educated people in the audience.
('16', 329, 3, 16, 728124) She will speak, all the same.
('16', 329, 3, 17, 728154) I have her permission for speaking in Gujarati.
('16', 329, 3, 18, 728202) Whatever I wish to tell you, I can say only in Gujarati.
('16', 329, 3, 19, 728259) Her speech will later be summarized for you in Gujarati.
('16', 329, 3, 20, 728316) The agitation she has launched in the present circumstances has been useful in several ways.
('16', 329, 3, 21, 728409) India has benefited from her work, her organizing ability and her eloquence; to honour her, the first thing to do is to hear her in silence.

('16', 330, 2, 3, 728770) March 13, 1918
('16', 330, 3, 4, 728785) Gandhiji started by requesting the people to maintain silence and stressed the importance of being punctual at a meeting.
('16', 330, 3, 5, 728907) He suggested that anyone who turned up from that time onwards should remain outside the gate.
('16', 330, 3, 6, 729001) The subject of today’s speech concerns our own interest; it is about swaraj.
('16', 330, 3, 7, 729078) Wealth, honour, strength—all these follow from swaraj.
('16', 330, 3, 8, 729133) One statement of this lady deserves to be engraved in our hearts and in the Government’s, that India would have Home Rule or go on hunger strike.
('16', 330, 3, 9, 729279) Everyone should ponder over this.
('16', 330, 3, 10, 729313) Being without political power, India is growing poorer and so abject is this poverty that thousands have been driven by it to inhuman crimes.
('16', 330, 3, 11, 729455) The idea of hunger strike is intended to bring home to us that a man who has been starving for some days would stop at nothing.
('16', 330, 3, 12, 729583) She is speaking today to explain this point.
('16', 330, 3, 13, 729628) If some of Mrs. Besant’s detractors succeed against her, that is only because she believes in action and has no interest except in her work.
('16', 330, 3, 14, 729769) She has dedicated herself, body and soul, and all she has, to her mission.
('16', 330, 3, 15, 729844) She has put before us what she had to say but it is not by following her way that we shall succeed in swimming across to the other side, we shall do so only by following our own.
('16', 330, 3, 16, 730023) If the honour Ahmedabad has accorded her today is sincere, you should pray to God that He may grant the strength she has to us as well.
('16', 330, 3, 17, 730159) And, with the same regard for her listen to her in silence.
('16', 330, 3, 18, 730219) Those who cannot follow English may read a translation tomorrow.
('16', 330, 4, 19, 730284) Concluding the proceedings, Shri Gandhi suggested that her speech should be translated into Gujarati and copies of the translation distributed among the people.
('16', 330, 4, 20, 730445) He described the speech as historic.
('16', 330, 4, 21, 730482) He then read out the names of those who had presented Mrs. Besant with purses and thanked them.
('16', 330, 4, 22, 730578) He advised everyone to ponder over her speech.

('16', 331, 2, 3, 730878) [Before March 15, 1918] 1
('16', 331, 3, 4, 730904) It is not proper that you ridicule the machines and call them “empty show cases”.
('16', 331, 3, 5, 730986) 2 These inanimate machines have done you no harm.
('16', 331, 3, 6, 731036) You had your living through these very machines.
('16', 331, 3, 7, 731085) I should like to tell our poets that we are not to use bitter words; we should not cast aspersions on the employers.
('16', 331, 3, 8, 731202) It serves no purpose to say that the rich go about in motor cars because of us.
('16', 331, 3, 9, 731282) That way, we only lose our own self respect.
('16', 331, 3, 10, 731327) I might as well say that even King Emperor George V rules because of us; but saying that reflects no credit on us.
('16', 331, 3, 11, 731442) We do not establish our goodness by calling others bad.
('16', 331, 3, 12, 731498) There is God above to keep watch over the wrongdoers.
('16', 331, 3, 13, 731552) He will punish them.
('16', 331, 3, 14, 731573) Who are we to judge?
('16', 331, 3, 15, 731594) We need say no more than that the employers are wrong in not giving us the 35 per cent increase.

('16', 331, 7, 19, 731778) What is the meaning of satyagraha if you help the workers with money to carry it on or if, this time, they have joined it in the hope that you will support them with such help?
('16', 331, 7, 20, 731955) What will be the value of such satyagraha?
('16', 331, 7, 21, 731998) The essence of satyagraha lies in cheerful submission to the suffering that may follow it.
('16', 331, 7, 22, 732089) The more a satyagrahi suffers, the more thoroughly he is tested.
('16', 331, 7, 23, 732154) [From Gujarati] Ek Dharmayuddha
('16', 331, 8, 24, 732186) 1 The speech was evidently made before Gandhiji commenced his fast.
('16', 331, 8, 25, 732254) 2 One of the workers had recited at the meeting a satirical verse on machines.
('16', 331, 8, 26, 732333) 3 The rest of the speech is not available.
('16', 331, 8, 27, 732376) 4 It can not be asc ertai ned whe ther the se rem arks wer e mad e ora lly or wer e par t of a let ter.
('16', 331, 8, 28, 732480) 5 The suggestion and the reply seem to belong to the period before Gandhiji commenced his fast on this date.

('16', 332, 3, 5, 732698) 14 As the weapon of the rich is money, that of the workers is their labour.
('16', 332, 3, 6, 732774) Just as a rich man would starve if he did not employ his wealth, even so if the worker did not employ his wealth— did not work—he would also starve.
('16', 332, 3, 7, 732923) One who does not work is not a worker.
('16', 332, 3, 8, 732962) A worker who is ashamed of working has no right to eat.
('16', 332, 3, 9, 733018) If, therefore, the workers desire to fulfil their pledge in this great struggle, they should learn to do some work or other.
('16', 332, 3, 10, 733143) Those who collect funds and, remaining idle, maintain themselves out of them do not deserve to win.
('16', 332, 3, 11, 733243) Workers are fighting for their pledge.
('16', 332, 3, 12, 733282) Those who want food without working for it do not, it may be said, understand what a pledge means.
('16', 332, 3, 13, 733381) He alone can keep his pledge who can feel shame or has self respect.
('16', 332, 3, 14, 733450) Is there anyone who will not look down on those who desire to be maintained on public funds without doing any work?
('16', 332, 3, 15, 733566) It behoves us, therefore, that we maintain ourselves by doing some work.
('16', 332, 3, 16, 733639) If a worker does not work, he is like sugar which has lost its sweetness.
('16', 332, 3, 17, 733713) If the sea water lost its salt, where would we get our salt from?
('16', 332, 3, 18, 733779) If the worker did not work, the world would come to an end.
('16', 332, 3, 19, 733839) This struggle is not merely for a 35 per cent increase; it is to show that workers are prepared to suffer for their rights.
('16', 332, 3, 20, 733963) We are fighting to uphold our honour.
('16', 332, 3, 21, 734001) We have launched on this struggle in order to better ourselves.
('16', 332, 3, 22, 734065) If we start using public funds improperly, we shall grow worse and not better.
('16', 332, 3, 23, 734144) Consider the matter from any angle you choose, you will see that we must maintain ourselves by our own labour.
('16', 332, 3, 24, 734255) Farhad 2 broke stones for the sake of Shirin, his beloved.
('16', 332, 3, 25, 734314) For the workers, their pledge is their Shirin.
('16', 332, 3, 26, 734361) Why should they not break stones for its sake?
('16', 332, 3, 27, 734408) For the sake of truth, Harishchandra 3 sold himself; why should workers not suffer hardships for upholding their pledge ?
('16', 332, 3, 28, 734530) For the sake of their honour, Imam Hassan and Hussain suffered greatly.
('16', 332, 3, 29, 734602) Should we not be prepared even to die for our honour?
('16', 332, 3, 30, 734656) If we get money while we remain idle at home and fight with that money, it would be untrue to say that we are fighting.

('16', 333, 1, 2, 734998) We hope, therefore, that every worker will work to maintain himself so that he may be able to keep his oath and remain firm.
('16', 333, 1, 3, 735123) If the struggle lengthens, it will be because of weakness on our part.
('16', 333, 1, 4, 735194) So long as the mill owners believe that workers will not take to any labour and, therefore, will eventually succumb, they will have no compassion and will continue to resist [the demand].
('16', 333, 1, 5, 735382) So long as they are not convinced that workers will never give in, they will not be moved by compassion and will continue to oppose the workers even at the sacrifice of their own profits.
('16', 333, 1, 6, 735570) When, however, they feel certain that the workers will, under no circumstances, give up their resolve, they will show compassion enough and welcome the workers back.
('16', 333, 1, 7, 735736) Today the employers believe that the workers will not do any manual labour and so are bound to succumb soon.
('16', 333, 1, 8, 735845) If the workers depend on others’ money for their maintenance, the mill owners will think that the source is bound to be exhausted sooner or later, and so will not take the workers seriously.
('16', 333, 1, 9, 736036) If, on the other hand, workers who have no [other] means of subsistence begin to do manual work, the employers will see that they will lose their workers unless they grant the 35 per cent increase forthwith.
('16', 333, 1, 10, 736244) Thus, it is for us to shorten or lengthen the struggle.
('16', 333, 1, 11, 736300) We shall be free the sooner by enduring greater suffering just now.
('16', 333, 1, 12, 736368) If we flinch from suffering, the struggle is bound to be protracted.
('16', 333, 1, 13, 736437) Those who have weakened will, we hope, consider all these points and become strong again.
('16', 333, 2, 14, 736527) SPECIAL INSTRUCTION
('16', 333, 3, 15, 736547) Some workers are inclined to believe that those who have weakened cannot be persuaded to become strong.
('16', 333, 3, 16, 736651) This is a wrong impression altogether.
('16', 333, 3, 17, 736690) It is the duty of us all—yours and ours—to try, with gentleness, to persuade those who have weakened for one reason or another.
('16', 333, 3, 18, 736818) It is also our duty to educate those who do not know what the struggle means.
('16', 333, 3, 19, 736896) What we have been saying is that we may not use threats, tell lies, or resort to violence, or exert pressure in any manner to keep anyone away from work.
('16', 333, 3, 20, 737050) If, despite persuasion, anyone resumes work, that is no reason for us to lose heart.
('16', 333, 3, 21, 737135) Even if only one person holds out, we shall never forsake him.

('16', 334, 1, 2, 737276) 224. SPEECH TO AHMEDABAD MILL HANDS
('16', 334, 2, 3, 737312) [Marsh 15, 1918] 1
('16', 334, 3, 4, 737331) You must have heard what happened this morning.
('16', 334, 3, 5, 737379) Some were shocked, others wept.
('16', 334, 3, 6, 737411) I do not feel that there was anything wrong, or anything of which I need be ashamed, in this morning’s development.
('16', 334, 3, 7, 737527) I do not feel angry at the criticism made by the residents of Jugaldas Chawl.
('16', 334, 3, 8, 737605) 2 Rather, I, and others as well who want to serve India, have much to learn from it.
('16', 334, 3, 9, 737690) I have always believed that, if our capacity for tapascharya or voluntary suffering is real enough, we are bound to reap the fruit.
('16', 334, 3, 10, 737822) You took an oath relying on my advice.
('16', 334, 3, 11, 737861) In this age the oath has lost its value.
('16', 334, 3, 12, 737902) Men break their oath at any time and for any reason and I am grieved to have been instrumental in thus lowering the value of an oath.
('16', 334, 3, 13, 738036) There is nothing else that will bind a man as effectively as an oath does.
('16', 334, 3, 14, 738111) The meaning of an oath is that we decide to do a particular thing with God in whom we believe as our witness.
('16', 334, 3, 15, 738221) People who are on a higher plane can perhaps do without oaths, but we who are on a lower one cannot.
('16', 334, 3, 16, 738322) We who fall a thousand times cannot raise ourselves without oaths.
('16', 334, 3, 17, 738389) You will admit that, had we not taken the oath and repeated it daily, many of us would have fallen long ago.
('16', 334, 3, 18, 738498) You yourselves have said that never before have you known a strike as peaceful as this.
('16', 334, 3, 19, 738586) The reason why some have fallen is that they are faced with starvation.
('16', 334, 3, 20, 738658) I would advice you to keep your oath even if you have to starve, though it is our pledge, mine and my co workers’, that we will not allow you to starve.
('16', 334, 3, 21, 738811) If we look on unconcernedly while you are starving, you may give up your pledge by all means.
('16', 334, 3, 22, 738905) There is one more thing we should have mentioned along with these two.
('16', 334, 3, 23, 738976) It is that if, while not allowing you to starve, we ask you to beg, we would be guilty in the eyes of God and would prove no better than thieves.
('16', 334, 3, 24, 739122) But what should I do to persuade you to maintain yourselves with manual labour?
('16', 334, 3, 25, 739202) I can do manual work, I have been doing it, and would do so even now; but I do not get the opportunity for it.
('16', 334, 3, 26, 739313) I have a number of things to attend to, and can,
('16', 334, 4, 27, 739362) 1 The speech was delivered on the evening of the day on which the fast commenced.
('16', 334, 4, 28, 739444) 2 Chhaganlal Gandhi had, the day before, gone to the Chawl to request the workers to attend the morning meeting and had been rebuffed by them with the remark: “What is it to Anasuyabehn and Gandhiji?
('16', 334, 4, 29, 739644) They come and go in their car; they eat sumptuous food, but we are suffering death agonies; attending meetings does not prevent starvation.” This was reported to Gandhiji.

('16', 335, 1, 2, 739858) therefore, do some manual work only by way of exercise.
('16', 335, 1, 3, 739914) Will it behove you to tell me that you have worked on looms, but cannot do other physical labour ?
('16', 335, 1, 4, 740013) This notion has taken deep root in India.
('16', 335, 1, 5, 740055) It is good as a principle that a man should specialize in one type of work only; but it would be improper to use this as an excuse.
('16', 335, 1, 6, 740187) I have thought much about this.
('16', 335, 1, 7, 740219) When I came to know of your bitter criticism of me, I felt that, if I wanted to keep you to the path of dharma and show you the worth of an oath and the value of labour, I must set a concrete example before you.
('16', 335, 1, 8, 740431) We are not out to have fun at your cost or to act a play.
('16', 335, 1, 9, 740489) How can I prove to you that we are prepared to carry out whatever we tell you?
('16', 335, 1, 10, 740568) I am not God that I can demonstrate this to you in some way [other than by fasting].
('16', 335, 1, 11, 740653) I should very much like to do something which would convince you that you would have to be plain with me, that it would not do for you merely to act a part.
('16', 335, 1, 12, 740810) Nobody can be induced or coerced to keep his oath.
('16', 335, 1, 13, 740861) Love is the only inducement that can be offered.
('16', 335, 1, 14, 740910) You must understand that he alone, who loves his religion, loves his honour and country, will refuse to give up his resolve ....
('16', 335, 1, 15, 741039) I am used to taking such pledges.
('16', 335, 1, 16, 741073) For fear that people may wrongly imitate me, I would rather not take one at all.
('16', 335, 1, 17, 741154) But I am dealing with hundreds of thousands of workers.
('16', 335, 1, 18, 741210) I must, therefore, see that my conscience is clean.
('16', 335, 1, 19, 741262) I wanted to show you that I was not playing with you.
('16', 335, 1, 20, 741316) I have attempted to show you by example that you should value your oath in the same manner as I have done.
('16', 335, 1, 21, 741423) You have already done one thing.
('16', 335, 1, 22, 741456) You could have said: “What have we to do with your oath, we cannot continue the fight, we must go back’’; but you did not do so.
('16', 335, 1, 23, 741585) You decided to accept our service.
('16', 335, 1, 24, 741620) And I thought of you the more highly for that.
('16', 335, 1, 25, 741667) It seemed a beautiful thing to me to sink or swim with you.

('16', 335, 3, 27, 741759) 1 The rest of the speech is not available.
('16', 335, 3, 28, 741802) Gandhiji’s fast became a subject of serious concern.
('16', 335, 3, 29, 741855) Anandshankar Dhruva who discussed it with Gandhiji doubted its efficacy for bringing about a real change of heart among the mill owners.
('16', 335, 3, 30, 741992) They strove to dissuade him; some offered to concede the demand for a 35 per cent increase for Gandhiji’s sake, but.
('16', 335, 3, 31, 742109) according to Mahadev Desai, he rejected it saying, “Do not give 35 per cent out of pity for me, but do so to respect the workers’ pledge, and to give them justice.”

('16', 336, 2, 3, 742354) [March 16, 1918] 1
('16', 336, 3, 4, 742373) LEAFLET NO.
('16', 336, 3, 5, 742385) 15 It is necessary to understand the motive and significance of Gandhiji’s vow to fast.
('16', 336, 3, 6, 742473) The first thing to remember is that this is not intended to influence the employers.
('16', 336, 3, 7, 742558) If the fast were conceived in that spirit, it would harm our struggle and bring us dishonour.
('16', 336, 3, 8, 742652) We want justice from the employers, not pity for us.
('16', 336, 3, 9, 742705) If there is to be any pity, let it be for the workers.
('16', 336, 3, 10, 742760) We believe that it is but the employers’ duty to have pity for the workers.
('16', 336, 3, 11, 742836) But we shall be ridiculed if we accept 35 per cent granted out of pity for Gandhiji.
('16', 336, 3, 12, 742921) Workers cannot accept it on that basis.
('16', 336, 3, 13, 742961) If Gandhiji exploited his relations with the employers or the people in general in this manner, he would be misusing his position and would lose his good name.
('16', 336, 3, 14, 743121) What connection could there possibly be between Gandhiji’s fast and the issue of workers’ wages?
('16', 336, 3, 15, 743218) Even if fifty persons resolve to starve themselves to death on the employers’ premises, how can the employers, for that reason, give the workers a 35 per cent increase if they have no right to it?
('16', 336, 3, 16, 743415) If this becomes a common practice for securing rights, it would be impossible to carry on the affairs of society.
('16', 336, 3, 17, 743529) Employers cannot and need not pay attention to this fast of Gandhiji, though it is impossible that Gandhiji’s action will have no effect on them.
('16', 336, 3, 18, 743675) We shall be sorry to the extent the employers are influenced by this action.
('16', 336, 3, 19, 743752) But, at the same time, we cannot sacrifice other far reaching results that the fast may possibly bring about.
('16', 336, 3, 20, 743862) Let us examine the purpose for which the fast has been undertaken.
('16', 336, 3, 21, 743929) Gandhiji saw that the oath was losing its force with the workers.
('16', 336, 3, 22, 743995) Some of them were ready to break their pledge out of fear of what they thought would be starvation.
('16', 336, 3, 23, 744095) It is intolerable that ten thousand men should give up their oath.
('16', 336, 3, 24, 744162) A man becomes weak by not keeping a vow and ultimately loses his dignity as man.
('16', 336, 3, 25, 744243) It is, therefore, our duty to do our utmost to help the workers to keep their oath.
('16', 336, 3, 26, 744327) Gandhiji felt that, if he fasted, he would show through this how much he himself valued a pledge.
('16', 336, 3, 27, 744425) Moreover, the workers talked of starvation.
('16', 336, 3, 28, 744469) ‘Starve but keep your oath’ was Gandhiji’s message to them.
('16', 336, 3, 29, 744529) He at any rate must live
('16', 336, 4, 30, 744554) 1 This leaflet appears to have been issued on the day following the fast.
('16', 336, 4, 31, 744628) On the next day, i.e., March 17, a leaflet was issued by Shankarlal Parikh and a settlement was reached in the morning of March 18.

('16', 337, 1, 2, 744802) up to it.
('16', 337, 1, 3, 744812) That he could do only if he himself was prepared to die fasting.
('16', 337, 1, 4, 744877) Besides, workers said they would not do manual labour, but said, all the same, they stood in need of financial help.
('16', 337, 1, 5, 744994) This seemed a terrible thing.
('16', 337, 1, 6, 745024) If the workers took up such an attitude, there would be utter chaos in the country.
('16', 337, 1, 7, 745108) There was only one way in which Gandhiji could effectively teach the people to submit to the hardships of physical labour and this was that he himself should suffer.
('16', 337, 1, 8, 745274) He did manual work, of course, but that was not enough.
('16', 337, 1, 9, 745330) A fast, he thought, would serve many purposes, and so commenced one.
('16', 337, 1, 10, 745399) He would break it only when the workers got 35 per cent or if they simply repudiated their pledge.
('16', 337, 1, 11, 745498) The result was as expected.
('16', 337, 1, 12, 745526) Those who were present when he took the vow saw this well enough.
('16', 337, 1, 13, 745592) The workers were roused; they started manual labour and were saved from betraying what was for them a matter of religion.
('16', 337, 1, 14, 745714) The workers have now realized that they will secure justice at the hands of the employers only if they remain firm in their oath.
('16', 337, 1, 15, 745844) Gandhiji’s fast has buoyed them up.
('16', 337, 1, 16, 745880) But they must rely on their own strength to fight.
('16', 337, 1, 17, 745931) They alone can save themselves.

('16', 337, 3, 20, 746029) [Before March 17, 1918]
('16', 337, 4, 21, 746053) I hope that on the basis of facts ascertained by me and my friends, and having regard to the hardships caused by the epidemic and plague and enhanced cost of living, either the recovery of land revenue would be postponed or an inquiry by an independent board would be made, such as the one I had originally asked for.
('16', 337, 4, 22, 746371) But if this last request of mine is ignored and properties are confiscated or sold, or land forfeited, I shall be compelled to advise the peasants openly not to pay up land revenue.
('16', 337, 5, 23, 746553) When I first entered Kheda district, I gave you the assurance that I will let you know before taking any extreme step.
('16', 337, 5, 24, 746672) I hope that you
('16', 337, 6, 25, 746688) 1 Officials had coerced agriculturists saying that the crop yield was adequate to pay the revenue assessment.
('16', 337, 6, 26, 746798) Gandhiji protested against this coercion.
('16', 337, 6, 27, 746840) Commissioner Pratt repudiated the opinion expressed by Gandhiji and his associates, and insisted that the right course was for the farmers to pay up their dues.
('16', 337, 6, 28, 747001) This was the background against which Gandhiji wrote to the Governor.

('16', 338, 1, 2, 747117) will bear in mind the various facts which I have set out in this letter.

('16', 338, 4, 6, 747307) March 17, 1918
('16', 338, 5, 7, 747322) The step I have just now taken is a very grave one, but at the back of it there stands a great idea.
('16', 338, 5, 8, 747423) It is grave because, on hearing of this all those who know me in India will be very much pained, be almost in an agony of grief.
('16', 338, 5, 9, 747552) But, at the same time, I have here an opportunity to convey to them a beautiful idea, and I should not miss it.
('16', 338, 5, 10, 747664) This is the motive behind my action.
('16', 338, 5, 11, 747701) I have been getting quite impatient for the last two days to explain it to you but I could not get enough quiet time for that.
('16', 338, 5, 12, 747828) It would make me very unhappy to miss the morning and evening prayers in the Ashram.
('16', 338, 5, 13, 747913) And, besides, yesterday the music maestro dropped in and so I just would not forgo the pleasure of hearing his strains.
('16', 338, 5, 14, 748033) I have swum past many a lure but many hungers still persist in me.
('16', 338, 5, 15, 748100) At present I get here all that I long for by way of music and, therefore, although it was Anasuyabehn’s express wish yesterday that I should stay on there, I insisted on coming over to the Ashram.
('16', 338, 5, 16, 748297) At a time like this, the music here has a very soothing effect on me.
('16', 338, 5, 17, 748367) This is indeed the best occasion for me to unburden my soul to you.
('16', 338, 5, 18, 748435) At other hours, you are likely to be busy with your work and to make you leave that and assemble here—that won’t be proper either.
('16', 338, 5, 19, 748566) From the ancient culture of India, I have gleaned a truth which, even if it is mastered by the few persons here at the moment, would give these few a mastery over the world.
('16', 338, 5, 20, 748740) Before telling you of it, however, I should like to say another thing.
('16', 338, 5, 21, 748811) At present, there is only one person in India over whom millions are crazy, for whom millions of our countrymen would lay down their lives.
('16', 338, 5, 22, 748951) That person is Tilak
('16', 338, 6, 23, 748972) 1 To this the Governor replied on March 17, as follows: “The Government has been kept fully informed of what has been happening in the Kheda district and is satisfied that the Collector and the other officers of the Revenue Department while acting strictly according to rules and regulations have the interest of the agriculturists at heart.” 2 In this Gandhiji has explained at length the reasons for his undertaking a fast in connection with the mill hands’ strike.
('16', 339, 0, 1, 749440) 340 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 339, 1, 2, 749482) Maharaj.
('16', 339, 1, 3, 749491) I often feel that this is a great asset of his, his great treasure.
('16', 339, 1, 4, 749559) He has written on the inner meaning of the Gita 1. But I have always felt that he has not understood the age old spirit of India, has not understood her soul and that is the reason why the nation has come to this pass.
('16', 339, 1, 5, 749778) Deep down in his heart, he would like us all to be what the Europeans are.
('16', 339, 1, 6, 749853) As Europe stands on top at present, as it seems, that is, to those whose minds are steeped in European notions—he wants India to be in the same position.
('16', 339, 1, 7, 750007) He underwent six years’ internment but only to display a courage of the European variety, with the idea that these people who are tyrannizing over us now may learn how, if it came to that, we too could stand such long terms of internment, be it five years or twenty five.
('16', 339, 1, 8, 750279) In the prisons of Siberia, many great men of Russia are wasting their whole lives, but these men did not go to prison in obedience to any spiritual promptings.
('16', 339, 1, 9, 750439) To be thus prodigal of one’s life is to expend our highest treasure to no purpose.
('16', 339, 1, 10, 750522) If Tilakji had undergone the sufferings of internment with a spiritual motive, things would not have been as they are and the results of his internment would have been far different.
('16', 339, 1, 11, 750705) This is what I should like to explain to him.
('16', 339, 1, 12, 750751) I have often, with great respect, spoken about this to him, as much as I could, though I have not put the thing in so many words orally or in writing.
('16', 339, 1, 13, 750902) I might have, in what I wrote, watered down my meaning, but Tilak Maharaj has so penetrating an intellect that he would understand.
('16', 339, 1, 14, 751034) This is, however, no matter to be explained orally or in writing.
('16', 339, 1, 15, 751100) To give him first hand experience of it, I must furnish a living example.
('16', 339, 1, 16, 751174) Indirectly, I have spoken to him often enough but, should I get an opportunity of providing a direct demonstration, I should not miss it, and here is one.
('16', 339, 1, 17, 751329) Another such person is Madan Mohan Malaviya.
('16', 339, 1, 18, 751374) Amongst the present leaders of India, he is a man of the holiest character —that is, amongst political personages and amongst those whom we know.
('16', 339, 1, 19, 751520) Unknown to us, there may be many such indeed.
('16', 339, 1, 20, 751566) But although he is so holy in his life and so well informed on points of dharma, he has not, it seems to me, properly understood the soul of India in all its grandeur.
('16', 339, 1, 21, 751734) I am afraid I have said too much.
('16', 339, 1, 22, 751768) If he were to hear this, Malaviyaji might get angry with me, even think of me as a swollen headed man and take a dislike to me.
('16', 339, 1, 23, 751896) But I feel no hesitation in saying what I do because it is quite true.
('16', 339, 1, 24, 751967) I have spoken to him many times.
('16', 339, 1, 25, 752000) I am bound to him by ties of affection and hence I have
('16', 339, 2, 26, 752056) 1 Gita Rahasya, which he wrote in Mandalay Jail, serving a six year term
('16', 340, 0, 1, 752129) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 341
('16', 340, 1, 2, 752175) even indulged in frequent wranglings with him.
('16', 340, 1, 3, 752222) At the end of all my arguments, however, he would merely say that all I had said might be true but that he was not convinced of it.
('16', 340, 1, 4, 752354) I have this opportunity to provide him, too, with a direct demonstration.
('16', 340, 1, 5, 752428) I owe it to both to show now what India’s soul is.
('16', 340, 2, 6, 752479) For the last twenty days, I have been mixing with ten thousand mill hands.
('16', 340, 2, 7, 752554) In my presence, they took a pledge in the name of God.
('16', 340, 2, 8, 752609) At the time, they did so with great enthusiasm.
('16', 340, 2, 9, 752657) Whatever type of people they are, they all believe at any rate that God exists.
('16', 340, 3, 10, 752737) They thought that, when they had observed the pledge for twenty days, God was bound to come to their help.
('16', 340, 3, 11, 752844) When that did not happen and God prolonged the test, their faith faltered.
('16', 340, 3, 12, 752919) They felt that, led by this one man, they had suffered all these days but gained nothing whatever, that if they had not allowed themselves to be prevailed upon by him but had turned militant, they would have had their 35 per cent, or even more, in a much shorter time.
('16', 340, 3, 13, 753188) This is my analysis of how their minds work.
('16', 340, 3, 14, 753233) I can never bear to be in such a situation.
('16', 340, 3, 15, 753277) That a pledge once taken, at my instance, should be so lightly broken and that faith in God should decline means certain annihilation of dharma.
('16', 340, 3, 16, 753422) I simply cannot live to be a witness to this in any activity to which I am a party.
('16', 340, 3, 17, 753506) I must impress upon the minds of the mill hands what it is to take a pledge.
('16', 340, 3, 18, 753583) I must show to them what I can do for a pledge; if I did not, I would be a coward.
('16', 340, 3, 19, 753666) For a man who brags of clearing seven feet, not to clear even one is impotence.
('16', 340, 3, 20, 753746) Well, then, to keep those ten thousand men from falling, I took this step.
('16', 340, 3, 21, 753821) This was why I took the vow and its impact was electrifying.
('16', 340, 3, 22, 753882) I had never expected this.
('16', 340, 3, 23, 753909) The thousands of men present there shed tears from their eyes.
('16', 340, 3, 24, 753972) They awoke to the reality of their soul, a new consciousness stirred in them and they got strength to stand by their pledge.
('16', 340, 3, 25, 754097) I was instantly persuaded that dharma had not vanished from India, that people do respond to an appeal to their soul.
('16', 340, 3, 26, 754215) If Tilak Maharaj and Malaviyaji would but see this, great things could be done in India.
('16', 340, 4, 27, 754304) I am at present overflowing with joy.
('16', 340, 4, 28, 754342) When, on a former occasion, I took such a vow, my mind did not enjoy the peace it does today.
('16', 340, 4, 29, 754436) I also felt at that time the pull of the body.
('16', 340, 4, 30, 754483) This time I experience nothing of the kind.
('16', 340, 4, 31, 754527) My mind is filled with profound peace.
('16', 340, 4, 32, 754566) I feel like pouring forth my soul to you all but I am beside myself with joy.
('16', 341, 0, 1, 754644) 342 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 341, 1, 2, 754686) My pledge is directed to making the mill hands honour theirs and teaching them what value to attach to a pledge.
('16', 341, 1, 3, 754799) For people in our country to take pledges whenever they fancy and break them at any moment betrays their degraded state.
('16', 341, 1, 4, 754920) And for ten thousand mill hands to break faith with themselves would spell ruin for the nation.
('16', 341, 1, 5, 755016) It would never again be possible to raise the workers’ issues.
('16', 341, 1, 6, 755079) At every turn they would quote this as an example and say that ten thousand mill hands endured suffering for twenty days with a man like Gandhi to lead them and still they did not win.
('16', 341, 1, 7, 755264) I was thus forced to consider by what means the mill hands could be made to remain firm.
('16', 341, 1, 8, 755353) How could I do this without suffering myself?
('16', 341, 1, 9, 755399) I saw that it was necessary to show them by example how, for the sake of one’s pledge, one had to undergo suffering.
('16', 341, 1, 10, 755516) So it was that I took this pledge.
('16', 341, 1, 11, 755551) I am aware that it carries a taint.
('16', 341, 1, 12, 755587) It is likely that, because of my vow, the mill owners may be moved by consideration for me and come to grant the workers’ [demand for] thirty five per cent increase.
('16', 341, 1, 13, 755753) My desire is that they should grant the demand only if they see its justice and not out of charity.
('16', 341, 1, 14, 755853) But the natural result would be that they would do so out of charity and to that extent this pledge is one which cannot but fill me with shame.
('16', 341, 1, 15, 755997) I weighed the two things, however, against each other: my sense of shame and the mill hands’ pledge.
('16', 341, 1, 16, 756098) The balance tilted in favour of the latter and I resolved, for the sake of the mill hands, to take no thought of my shame.
('16', 341, 1, 17, 756221) In doing public work, a man must be prepared to put up even with such loss of face.
('16', 341, 1, 18, 756305) Thus, my pledge is not at all by way of a threat to the mill owners; on the contrary, I wish they clearly understand this and grant the 35 per cent to the mill hands only if they think it just to do so.
('16', 341, 1, 19, 756508) To the mill hands, too, I would say that they should go to the owners and tell them as much.

('16', 341, 5, 24, 756806) The latter gives me immense pleasure and, therefore, need not cause pain to anyone.
('16', 341, 5, 25, 756890) The workers will profit more from what they get as a matter of justice—they will enjoy the

('16', 342, 1, 4, 757083) 35 per cent, 20 per cent, and arbitrator—we may go in for such foolishness, put up with it, to satisfy our conscience or our pride.
('16', 342, 1, 5, 757215) The workers, being simple minded, will look upon the thing as calculated deception.
('16', 342, 1, 6, 757299) I should, therefore, prefer some other way, if we can find any.
('16', 342, 1, 7, 757363) If you want me to accept this, I will, but I won’t have you decide the matter in haste.
('16', 342, 1, 8, 757451) Let the arbitrator meet us and come to a decision right now, and let us announce the wage fixed by him; that is, 35 per cent on the first day, 20 on the second and, on the third, what the arbitrator decides.
('16', 342, 1, 9, 757659) There is foolishness even in this, but things will be left in no doubt.
('16', 342, 1, 10, 757731) The wage for the third day should be announced this very day.

('16', 342, 6, 15, 757880) The mill owners came and told me, “We shall give 35 per cent for your sake,” but it would cut me to the quick if they did so.
('16', 342, 6, 16, 758006) I knew they had been thinking that way, but I could not go back on my resolve, for I thought that ten thousand men debasing themselves would be like a curse from on high.
('16', 342, 6, 17, 758177) It is extremely humiliating to me that they offer you 35 per cent for my sake.

('16', 343, 8, 12, 759020) March 18, 1918
('16', 343, 9, 13, 759035) Most probably, we shall have a settlement today before ten.
('16', 343, 9, 14, 759095) I am quite clear in my mind what it means and I see that it is something which should be quite unacceptable to me.
('16', 343, 9, 15, 759210) It is my vow of fasting which is to blame.
('16', 343, 9, 16, 759253) The vow is open to criticism from many points of view.
('16', 343, 9, 17, 759308) This does not mean, of course, that it had very little in its favour and much against it; it means that, if there was much in its favour, there was much against it too.
('16', 343, 9, 18, 759477) In so far as it affected the workers there was much in its favour and the results have been correspondingly wholesome.
('16', 343, 9, 19, 759596) In so far as it bore on the mill owners, it was open to objection and, to that extent, I have had to give in.
('16', 343, 9, 20, 759706) Deny it as emphatically as I may, the people cannot but feel that the mill owners have acted under pressure of my fast and the world at large will not believe what I say.
('16', 343, 9, 21, 759877) My weak condition left the mill owners no freedom.
('16', 343, 9, 22, 759928) It is against the principles of justice to get anything in writing from a person or make him agree to any condition or obtain anything whatever under duress.
('16', 343, 9, 23, 760086) A satyagrahi will never do so.
('16', 343, 9, 24, 760117) I have had, therefore, to give in on this matter.
('16', 343, 9, 25, 760167) A man overpowered by a sense of shame, how much, after all, can he do ?
('16', 343, 9, 26, 760239) I put forward one modest demand after another and had to be content with what they

('16', 344, 0, 1, 760434) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 345
('16', 344, 1, 2, 760480) accepted gracefully.
('16', 344, 1, 3, 760501) If I had insisted on our demand in full, they would have met it.
('16', 344, 1, 4, 760566) But I could not at all bring myself to secure anything from them by putting them in such a position.
('16', 344, 1, 5, 760667) If I had done anything of the kind, I would have felt that I was breaking my fast by swallowing something most repulsive; how could I, who would not take even amrit 1 except at the proper hour, swallow such a thing?
('16', 344, 2, 6, 760883) I feel that some of the teachings of our sacred books are the result of profound experience.
('16', 344, 2, 7, 760976) Thoreau has said that, where injustice prevails, an upright man simply cannot prosper and that, where justice prevails, such a one would experience no want.
('16', 344, 2, 8, 761133) Our sacred books go even further and say that, where injustice prevails, an upright man just cannot live.
('16', 344, 2, 9, 761239) That is why some amongst us withdraw from all activity.
('16', 344, 2, 10, 761295) They do so not because they have grown weary of active life but simply because they find it impossible to take up any activity.
('16', 344, 2, 11, 761423) They see so much of hypocrisy in the world that they cannot live in it.
('16', 344, 2, 12, 761495) If an honest man finds himself surrounded on all sides by crooks, he should either turn his back on them or be as they are.
('16', 344, 2, 13, 761619) In our world, some good men take to the Himalayas or the Vindhya mountains and mortify their bodies.
('16', 344, 2, 14, 761720) Some think this body to be unreal; some, believing in the immortality and omnipresence of the soul, give up their bodies on the instant and attain moksha.
('16', 344, 2, 15, 761875) Some do return but only after having so purified themselves that, thereafter, even while living in the midst of the world’s hypocrisies, they can follow their own dictates.
('16', 344, 2, 16, 762048) When I compare my state with that of these illuminated souls, I am such a mere pigmy that I don’t know what to say.
('16', 344, 2, 17, 762164) To be sure, it is not as if I did not know the measure of my strength.
('16', 344, 2, 18, 762235) But in the outside world, it is esteemed much higher than it ought to be.
('16', 344, 2, 19, 762309) Every day I discover so much of hypocrisy in the world that many times I feel I just cannot go on being here.
('16', 344, 2, 20, 762419) At Phoenix, I often told you that, if one day you did not find me in your midst, you should not be surprised.
('16', 344, 2, 21, 762529) If this feeling comes over me, I will go where you will never be able to seek me out.
('16', 344, 2, 22, 762615) In that hour, do not feel bewildered, but go on with the tasks on hand as if I were with you all the time.

('16', 345, 3, 4, 762931) The settlement which I place before you merely upholds the workers’ pledge.
('16', 345, 3, 5, 763007) There is nothing more in it.
('16', 345, 3, 6, 763036) I pleaded with the mill owners as well as I could.
('16', 345, 3, 7, 763087) I asked them to grant a permanent increase of 35 per cent.
('16', 345, 3, 8, 763146) They felt, however, that that would be too much.
('16', 345, 3, 9, 763195) Let me say one thing.
('16', 345, 3, 10, 763217) Our demand, too, was onesided.
('16', 345, 3, 11, 763248) Before the struggle commenced, we had tried to ascertain their point of view, but they did not respond to our request.
('16', 345, 3, 12, 763367) The mill owners now accept the principle of arbitration.
('16', 345, 3, 13, 763424) I have agreed that the matter be entrusted to an arbitrator 2. I shall succeed in getting 35 per cent from the arbitrator.
('16', 345, 3, 14, 763547) If the arbitrator decides on something less, I will own that we had been wrong in making our demand.
('16', 345, 3, 15, 763648) The mill owners said that they had their pledge to abide by just as we had ours.
('16', 345, 3, 16, 763729) I told them that they had no right to take any such pledge, but they insisted that theirs too was equally valid.
('16', 345, 3, 17, 763842) I thought over the pledges of both.
('16', 345, 3, 18, 763878) My fast stood in the way.
('16', 345, 3, 19, 763904) I could not tell them: “I will break my fast only if you concede my demand.” I felt that this would have been cowardice on my part.
('16', 345, 3, 20, 764036) I, therefore, agreed that for the present both may maintain their pledges, and what the arbitrator decides should finally prevail.
('16', 345, 3, 21, 764167) Our settlement, therefore, is briefly this: On the first day, an increase of 35 per cent will be given in keeping with our pledge; on the second day, we get 20 per cent in keeping with the mill owners’.
('16', 345, 3, 22, 764370) From the third day till the date of the arbitrator’s award, an increase of 27_ per cent will be paid and subsequently, if the arbitrator decides on 35 per cent, the mill owners will give us 7_ per cent more and, if he decides on 20 per cent, we shall refund 7_ per cent.
('16', 345, 3, 23, 764641) What I have brought for you is enough to fulfil the letter of the pledge, but not its spirit.
('16', 345, 3, 24, 764735) Spirit does not mean much to us and so we must rest content with the letter.
('16', 345, 3, 25, 764812) We have taken counsel together in this struggle; therefore, do not take an oath hereafter without consulting us.
('16', 345, 3, 26, 764925) He who has no
('16', 345, 4, 27, 764939) 1 The settlement was arrived at on the morning of the 18th.
('16', 345, 4, 28, 764999) According to Ek Dharmayuddha, Gandhiji announced it to the workers gathered in their thousands under the babul tree, evidently the same day.
('16', 345, 4, 29, 765140) The meeting was attended by the Commissioner and prominent men of Ahmedabad.

('16', 345, 4, 31, 765225) Anandshankar Dhruva, who was acceptable to both parties, was appointed.

('16', 346, 1, 3, 765416) After twenty years’ experience, I have come to the conclusion that I am qualified to take a pledge.
('16', 346, 1, 4, 765516) I see that you are not yet so qualified.
('16', 346, 1, 5, 765557) Do not, therefore, take an oath without consulting your seniors.
('16', 346, 1, 6, 765622) If the occasion demands one, come to us, assured that we shall be prepared to die for you, as we now are.
('16', 346, 1, 7, 765728) But remember that we shall help you only in respect of a pledge you have taken with our concurrence.
('16', 346, 1, 8, 765829) A pledge taken in error can certainly be ignored.
('16', 346, 1, 9, 765879) You have yet to learn how and when to take a pledge.

('16', 346, 5, 13, 766002) [March 18, 1918]
('16', 346, 6, 14, 766019) It appears to me that as days pass, not only Ahmedabad but the whole of India will be proud of this twenty two days’ struggle and India will see that we can hope much from a struggle conducted in this manner.
('16', 346, 6, 15, 766228) There has been no bitterness in it.
('16', 346, 6, 16, 766264) I have never come across the like of it.
('16', 346, 6, 17, 766305) I have had experience of many such conflicts or heard of them, but have not known any in which there was so little ill will or bitterness as in this.
('16', 346, 6, 18, 766455) I hope you will always maintain peace in the same way as you did during the strike.
('16', 346, 6, 19, 766539) I must apologize to the employers.
('16', 346, 6, 20, 766574) I have pained them very much.
('16', 346, 6, 21, 766604) My vow [to fast] was aimed at you, but everything in this world has two sides.
('16', 346, 6, 22, 766683) Thus, the vow had an effect on the employers as well, I apologize to them humbly for this, I am as much their servant as the workers’.
('16', 346, 6, 23, 766818) All I ask is that both should utilize my services to the full.

('16', 346, 7, 27, 767079) The mill owners distributed sweets among the workers.

('16', 347, 7, 12, 767542) March 19, 1918
('16', 347, 8, 13, 767557) LEAFLET NO.
('16', 347, 9, 14, 767569) VICTORY FOR BOTH We have said in earlier leaflets that in satyagraha both the parties invariably succeed.
('16', 347, 9, 15, 767675) He who fought for truth and attained his object would of course have won.
('16', 347, 9, 16, 767749) But even he who first opposed the truth and subsequently recognized it as such and conceded it should also be considered to have won.
('16', 347, 9, 17, 767883) From this point of view, because the workers’ pledge has been fulfilled, both the parties have won.
('16', 347, 9, 18, 767983) The employers had taken an oath that they would not give more than 20 per cent.
('16', 347, 9, 19, 768063) We have respected their oath, too.
('16', 347, 9, 20, 768098) Thus the honour of both has been upheld.
('16', 347, 9, 21, 768139) Let us now see what the settlement is: 1. Workers are to resume work tomorrow, i.e., on the 20th; for that day they will get a 35 per cent increase; and for the 21st, a 20 per cent increase.
('16', 347, 9, 22, 768330) 2. From the 22nd, they will get an increase not exceeding 35 per cent, as the arbitrator may decide.
('16', 347, 9, 23, 768431) 3. Prof.
('16', 347, 9, 24, 768440) Anandshankar Bapubhai Dhruva, M.A., LL.B., a prominent man of letters of Gujarat and a man of saintly character, a professor in Gujarat College and its Vice Principal, will be the arbitrator.
('16', 347, 9, 25, 768632) 4. The arbitrator should give his award within three months.
('16', 347, 9, 26, 768693) During the period, workers will be paid an increase of 27_ per cent, i.e., the workers give up half of their demand and the employers half
('16', 347, 10, 27, 768832) 1 Gandhiji probably sent the wire on the day of the settlement.
('16', 347, 10, 28, 768896) Annie Besant published it with the comment: “It is impossible to tell the relief brought by his message.
('16', 347, 10, 29, 769001) We can only say with him: ‘Thank God’.”
('16', 348, 0, 1, 769041) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 349
('16', 348, 1, 2, 769087) of theirs.
('16', 348, 1, 3, 769098) 5. Whatever amount is decided by the arbitrator will be adjusted against the 27_ per cent, i.e., if the arbitrator awards more than 27_ per cent, the employers will give that increase and, if he awards less than 27_ per cent, the workers will refund the excess.
('16', 348, 1, 4, 769360) Two things have been accomplished by this settlement.
('16', 348, 1, 5, 769414) First, the honour of the workers has been upheld; secondly, it has been accepted as a principle that any serious dispute between the two parties should be settled not by resort to a strike but by arbitration.
('16', 348, 1, 6, 769623) It is not one of the terms of the settlement that in future the parties will settle their differences by arbitration; but, as the settlement has come about through arbitration, it is presumed that on a similar occasion in future also an arbitrator will be appointed.
('16', 348, 1, 7, 769890) It should not be understood from this that an arbitrator will be appointed even for trifling differences.
('16', 348, 1, 8, 769996) It will be humiliating to both parties if a third party has to intervene every time there is a difference between the employers and the workers.
('16', 348, 1, 9, 770141) Employers cannot tolerate that.
('16', 348, 1, 10, 770173) They will not do their business under such conditions.
('16', 348, 1, 11, 770228) The world has always respected wealth and it will always demand respect.
('16', 348, 1, 12, 770301) Consequently, if workers harass the employers for trifles, the relations that now obtain between them will break.
('16', 348, 1, 13, 770415) We believe workers will not do anything of the kind.
('16', 348, 1, 14, 770468) We must also advise them that they should never resort to a strike in thoughtless haste.
('16', 348, 1, 15, 770557) We can give them no help if they go on strike without consulting us.
('16', 348, 1, 16, 770626) Doubt has been raised whether we are right in claiming that our pledge has been fulfilled, since we have secured an increase of 35 per cent for one day only.
('16', 348, 1, 17, 770784) This seems very much like pacifying children.
('16', 348, 1, 18, 770830) This has certainly happened on some occasions but not in this case.
('16', 348, 1, 19, 770898) We have accepted 35 per cent for one day deliberately as the best thing to do in the circumstances.
('16', 348, 1, 20, 770998) “We will not resume work without securing a 35 per cent increase” may mean one of two things; one, that we will not accept anything less than a 35 per cent increase at any time and, two, that we will resume work with a 35 per cent increase, it being enough even if we get it just for a day.
('16', 348, 1, 21, 771289) Those who may have decided that it is just to demand a permanent increase of 35 per cent and feel sure that they have strength in plenty to fight till they get it will consider their pledge fulfilled only when they get what they want.
('16', 348, 1, 22, 771524) But that was not what we had resolved.
('16', 348, 1, 23, 771563) We were always ready to accept an arbitrator’s decision.
('16', 348, 1, 24, 771620) The figure of 35 per cent was fixed unilaterally.
('16', 348, 1, 25, 771670) Before we advised workers to demand 35 per cent, we wanted to hear from the employers themselves their
('16', 349, 0, 1, 771773) 350 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 349, 1, 2, 771815) view of the matter.
('16', 349, 1, 3, 771835) Unfortunately, we did not succeed.
('16', 349, 1, 4, 771870) So we examined their side as best we could and advised a demand for 35 per cent.
('16', 349, 1, 5, 771951) But we cannot claim that the figure of 35 per cent was not open to question.
('16', 349, 1, 6, 772028) We have never said so.
('16', 349, 1, 7, 772051) If the employers prove that we are mistaken, we may certainly advise workers to accept less.
('16', 349, 1, 8, 772144) Hence, if the arbitrator decides in favour of a smaller increase and we abide by his decision, our pledge will not have been violated.
('16', 349, 1, 9, 772279) We always accepted the principle of arbitration.
('16', 349, 1, 10, 772328) We think we were not wrong in deciding upon a 35 per cent increase; we hope, therefore, that this increase will be granted.
('16', 349, 1, 11, 772452) If, however, we discover that the figure was wrong, we should willingly accept less.
('16', 349, 2, 12, 772537) We ourselves have asked for three months’ time.
('16', 349, 2, 13, 772585) Employers were willing to accept a fortnight’s time limit.
('16', 349, 2, 14, 772644) We have, however, to make some inquiries in Bombay to prove the justice of our demand.
('16', 349, 2, 15, 772731) It is also very necessary to show to the arbitrator the conditions prevailing here and to acquaint him fully with the living conditions of workers.
('16', 349, 2, 16, 772879) Without such information, he cannot have a complete idea.
('16', 349, 2, 17, 772937) Such detailed work cannot be completed in a few days.
('16', 349, 2, 18, 772991) We shall see, however, that the work is completed as speedily as possible.
('16', 349, 3, 19, 773066) Some workers wanted to be paid for the period of the lock out.
('16', 349, 3, 20, 773129) We must say that we are not entitled to ask for this.
('16', 349, 3, 21, 773183) Since we did not accept the 20 per cent increase, either a strike or a lock out became necessary.
('16', 349, 3, 22, 773281) In suffering for 22 days, we did what was merely our duty and was in our own interest.
('16', 349, 3, 23, 773368) We have had our reward for that suffering, namely, this settlement.
('16', 349, 3, 24, 773436) How can we now ask for wages for the period of the lock out?
('16', 349, 3, 25, 773497) Such demand [if accepted] would amount to our having fought the struggle with the employers’ money.
('16', 349, 3, 26, 773597) The workers should be ashamed to entertain such an idea.
('16', 349, 3, 27, 773654) A warrior must fight on his own strength.
('16', 349, 3, 28, 773696) Again, the employers had paid all wages due to the workmen before the lock out, so that it can be said that workers now begin a new term of employment.
('16', 349, 3, 29, 773848) They should consider all these points and give up the idea of asking for wages for the period of the lock out.
('16', 349, 4, 30, 773959) The wages will be due only after twenty days.
('16', 349, 4, 31, 774005) What will be the workers’ condition in the meantime?
('16', 349, 4, 32, 774058) Many may not have a pie left with them.
('16', 349, 4, 33, 774098) Those who are in need of assistance before the date of payment should politely request their employers for it and we are sure they will make some provision.
('16', 349, 5, 34, 774255) The workers should note that their condition hereafter will
('16', 350, 0, 1, 774315) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 351
('16', 350, 1, 2, 774361) depend on the quality of their work.
('16', 350, 1, 3, 774398) If they work sincerely, obediently and with energy, they will win the employers’ goodwill and be helped by them in a great many ways.
('16', 350, 1, 4, 774532) It would be a mistake to believe that anything could be secured only through us.
('16', 350, 1, 5, 774613) We are prepared to serve labour in their time of difficulty, but their interests will be best served if they look upon the employers as their parents and approach them for all that they want.
('16', 350, 1, 6, 774805) The need now is for peace.
('16', 350, 1, 7, 774832) Small inconveniences should be tolerated.
('16', 350, 1, 8, 774874) If you permit us, we should like to help some of you to overcome your bad habits.
('16', 350, 1, 9, 774956) We want to provide facilities for your and your children’s education.
('16', 350, 1, 10, 775026) We want to see all round improvement in you, in your morals, in your and your children’s health, and in your economic condition.
('16', 350, 1, 11, 775155) If you permit us, we will work amongst you towards this end.
('16', 350, 1, 12, 775216) The greatest victory for the workers lies in this—God has kept their honour inviolate.
('16', 350, 1, 13, 775303) He whose honour is preserved has secured all else.
('16', 350, 1, 14, 775354) Even imperial rule over the world is as dust, if gained at the sacrifice of one’s honour.

('16', 350, 3, 17, 775507) March 19, 1918
('16', 350, 4, 18, 775522) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('16', 350, 4, 19, 775555) If indeed you have not got justice at my hands, why don’t you give me up?
('16', 350, 4, 20, 775629) What I told you was only in the nature of advice.
('16', 350, 4, 21, 775679) I told you that you might follow my advice only if you agreed.
('16', 350, 4, 22, 775742) If you decided to give up public work, that was because you approved of my advice.
('16', 350, 4, 23, 775825) If now you find that there is nothing but harshness in it, you can certainly set it aside.
('16', 350, 4, 24, 775916) I would advise you now to go on with your work as before.
('16', 350, 4, 25, 775974) I don’t say this in anger but because I think it right.
('16', 350, 4, 26, 776030) You are incapable of remembering what you might have said earlier.
('16', 350, 4, 27, 776097) I feel, therefore, that for the present you should follow your own independent way.
('16', 350, 4, 28, 776181) Only so will you prosper.
('16', 350, 4, 29, 776207) You will sink low if you treat even my advice as an order and believe that you must not depart from it ever so little.
('16', 350, 4, 30, 776326) The best course for you, it seems to me, is to be engrossed in your Home Rule work, and I

('16', 351, 1, 2, 776458) hope that is the course you will adopt.
('16', 351, 1, 3, 776498) Rest assured I shall not be angry with you for being occupied with conferences, etc.
('16', 351, 1, 4, 776583) You may also approach me for advice when you know the difference between my advice and my order.
('16', 351, 1, 5, 776680) I write this letter entirely for your peace of mind, not to make you unhappy.

('16', 351, 5, 9, 776871) DEAR MR. PRATT, Messages have been coming to me, and one has arrived just this very moment, to the effect that in several villages Talatis are putting undue pressure upon the villagers to pay the dues.
('16', 351, 5, 10, 777073) Representations have come from Matar Taluka asking me to go over to the District and speak to the people.
('16', 351, 5, 11, 777179) From everywhere in the Kaira District people have been coming in and asking for some public pronouncement.
('16', 351, 5, 12, 777286) As you are aware beyond speaking to the people as to what they ought to do I have scrupulously refrained from making any public announcement or inviting public agitation.
('16', 351, 5, 13, 777457) Indeed I have gone so far as to tell friends on whom I exercise any influence to avoid discussion in the press.
('16', 351, 5, 14, 777569) Before making public declaration and holding meetings, etc., I do want to make a final appeal to you.
('16', 351, 5, 15, 777671) Is it impossible to anounce a general suspension of the collection of the second instalment, practically for the whole District, coupled with a declaration to the effect that the Government would still expect holders of sanadia land to pay the dues in full?
('16', 351, 5, 16, 777929) This will avoid a ferment and it will be a graceful concession which I verily believe is demanded by the circumstances of the case.
('16', 351, 6, 17, 778061) I am at your service should you want it.

('16', 352, 3, 4, 778362) I have had occasion before now to introduce Mr. Andrews to you.
('16', 352, 3, 5, 778426) He can best be described as a rishi for he has all the qualities of a holy sage.
('16', 352, 3, 6, 778507) He has recently returned from Fiji, where he went on a mission that concerns us.
('16', 352, 3, 7, 778588) While in Fiji, he did not put up in any hotel or with any well to do person; he lived among the labourers, in their own houses, and studied their manner of living.
('16', 352, 3, 8, 778752) We have, at present, the Kheda affair on hand.
('16', 352, 3, 9, 778799) I am now in a position to tell you on the basis of my own investigation that, in some of the talukas of that district, the crop has been less than four annas.
('16', 352, 3, 10, 778958) On the other hand, I am in a great hurry to leave for Delhi, the occasion being quite urgent.
('16', 352, 3, 11, 779052) I should not, however, like the work in Kheda district to be delayed and I am sure you will be glad to hear that Mr. Andrews has taken it up as his own for the time being.
('16', 352, 3, 12, 779224) He is leaving today for Bombay to see His Excellency the Governor.
('16', 352, 3, 13, 779291) He will, on my behalf, place certain facts before him and also convey my request.
('16', 352, 3, 14, 779373) If anything comes of this, all right; otherwise he will be in Nadiad on Sunday next.
('16', 352, 3, 15, 779458) Thus, he has started working for our cause as well.
('16', 352, 4, 16, 779510) I was happy to hear Mr. Andrews speak in Hindi.
('16', 352, 4, 17, 779558) I was not responsible for that, however.
('16', 352, 4, 18, 779599) He speaks very well in English also; what need one say of a Cambridge don’s English?
('16', 352, 4, 19, 779684) If he were addressing a meeting of students on Milton or Shakespeare, it would be quite right for him to speak in English.
('16', 352, 4, 20, 779807) The first time Mr. Andrews went to Fiji, 3 he was accompanied by Mr. Pearson and on the second occasion he went alone.
('16', 352, 4, 21, 779926) It was I who advised him to go there to observe things, lest a system as harmful as indenture came to replace it.
('16', 352, 4, 22, 780040) The hospitals Mr. Andrews mentioned are in fact no hospitals but engines of oppression, as one might say, for the plight of Indian women in these hospitals is miserable indeed.
('16', 352, 4, 23, 780217) When Mr. Andrews asked the Government to open hospitals for women in that country, it replied that it was for the planters to do so and the latter, on their part, said that the Government would attend to the matter when the system
('16', 352, 5, 24, 780448) 1 Gandhiji made these preliminary remarks as Chairman.
('16', 352, 5, 25, 780503) The meeting was addressed by C. F. Andrews on the condition of Indian indentured labourers in Fiji, where he had spent over four months in 1917, and worked for the Indian community’s betterment.
('16', 352, 5, 26, 780698) 2 What follow are Gandhiji’s observations after Andrews had spoken.
('16', 352, 5, 27, 780766) 3 This was in 1915.

('16', 353, 1, 2, 780828) of indenture had ended.
('16', 353, 1, 3, 780852) In schools, children receive instruction in the Christian faith from the very start.
('16', 353, 1, 4, 780937) This is not good for Hindu and Muslim children.
('16', 353, 1, 5, 780985) Moreover, the education is through the medium of English and, therefore, our people gain little from it.
('16', 353, 1, 6, 781090) The same thing obtains in Natal.
('16', 353, 1, 7, 781123) Indian teachers are not available there, nor in Fiji.
('16', 353, 1, 8, 781177) We can be of help in this matter.
('16', 353, 1, 9, 781211) If a few men who will be satisfied with a small income go over to these places as teachers, that will be of some help.
('16', 353, 1, 10, 781330) One may also help by giving anything from a pie to a hundred thousand rupees.
('16', 353, 1, 11, 781408) The expenses on the Australian lady who has volunteered to go to Fiji will, for the time being, be borne by Mr. Andrews.
('16', 353, 1, 12, 781529) He will get some assistance from the Imperial Citizenship Association, but further help will be needed.
('16', 353, 1, 13, 781633) I don’t know how to estimate the value of all these services of Mr. Andrews.
('16', 353, 1, 14, 781710) He is a man of retiring disposition and service of others is his one mission in life.
('16', 353, 1, 15, 781796) I have deliberately called him a rishi.
('16', 353, 1, 16, 781836) A great man like him, given to serving others, we cannot thank enough.

('16', 353, 3, 19, 781970) March 22, 1918
('16', 353, 4, 20, 781985) The occasion which has brought us here is so important that it will be enshrined in your memory for ever.
('16', 353, 4, 21, 782091) For some months past, an agitation has been going on in this district for securing the suspension of land revenue.
('16', 353, 4, 22, 782206) The crops have been generally less than four annas this year and so the collection of revenue ought to be suspended.
('16', 353, 4, 23, 782323) In compliance with the Resolution of the Gujarat Sabha, I toured a number of villages and inquired personally into the matter.
('16', 353, 4, 24, 782450) My co workers did the same.
('16', 353, 4, 25, 782478) The available evidence goes to show that the crops do not exceed four annas in the district as a whole.
('16', 353, 4, 26, 782582) The Government, too, claims to have made an inquiry, but it is not prepared to give the needed relief to the farmers.
('16', 353, 4, 27, 782700) It has decided to collect the dues.
('16', 353, 4, 28, 782736) If people do not pay, it has threatened to adopt coercive measures.
('16', 353, 4, 29, 782804) Notices have been issued for the collection of
('16', 353, 5, 30, 782851) 1 Gandhiji addressed a meeting of about 5,000 people in connection with the situation in Kheda.
('16', 353, 5, 31, 782947) The meeting marked the inauguration of Kheda satyagraha.
('16', 353, 5, 32, 783004) This report of Gandhiji’s speech has been collated with the one available in Bombay Secret Abstracts, 1918.

('16', 354, 1, 2, 783158) chothai 1 and for the confiscation of holdings.
('16', 354, 1, 3, 783206) Complaints of oppression by Talatis are also being received.
('16', 354, 1, 4, 783267) I have only this to say to the Talatis and chiefs of villages who are present at this meeting: “Let them by all means be loyal to the Government but that loyalty does not lie in oppressing [the people].” The land revenue must be realized, as ordered, but the Government certainly would not ask them to beat the people.
('16', 354, 1, 5, 783586) Surely, the law can never authorize such an order.
('16', 354, 1, 6, 783637) If there should be any such order, the Talatis are not bound to obey it.
('16', 354, 1, 7, 783710) Anyone acting in this manner will be committing treason against the country, the State and God.
('16', 354, 1, 8, 783806) They may execute the orders of superiors loyally, but they have no right to molest the people.
('16', 354, 1, 9, 783901) If they are convinced that the crop is below four annas they should say so boldly to their superior officers.
('16', 354, 1, 10, 784011) There are two reasons why I give you this advice.
('16', 354, 1, 11, 784061) It has been the system of Government to assert that what they have said is true.
('16', 354, 1, 12, 784142) In a talk with Lord Willingdon I came to know his opinion that the people of India do not give out their correct views; they are not bold enough to say what they mean; they say anything which pleases the other party; they are lacking in moral courage.
('16', 354, 2, 13, 784394) What are the people to do in this situation?
('16', 354, 2, 14, 784439) Those whose crops are less than four annas should tell the Government politely: “It is not possible for us to submit to this injustice; when the crops have, in fact, failed, we cannot pay up our dues and thereby prove ourselves liars.
('16', 354, 2, 15, 784674) You may realize the dues by force if you choose.” It is to give you this advice that this meeting has been called.
('16', 354, 2, 16, 784789) This is a very beautiful district.
('16', 354, 2, 17, 784824) Its people has delightful trees, the like of which I have in this country except in Bihar.
('16', 354, 2, 18, 784915) But Bihar has natural beauty, while in this district beauty has been achieved by hard work and perseverance.
('16', 354, 2, 19, 785024) This is the only district which can boast of intelligent and industrious agriculturists.
('16', 354, 2, 20, 785113) They have turned their land into a lovely orchard.
('16', 354, 2, 21, 785164) They can be justly proud of their achievement.
('16', 354, 2, 22, 785211) It does not, however, follow that they may be called upon to pay land revenue even when their crops have failed.
('16', 354, 2, 23, 785324) This industrious section of the district’s population is steadily growing poorer and many have been compelled to give up agriculture and take to daily labour.
('16', 354, 2, 24, 785483) This is a distressing thing for anyone to have to do.
('16', 354, 2, 25, 785537) A country in which the farmers find this necessary is in for a bad time.
('16', 354, 3, 26, 785610) 1 One fourth of the assessment exacted as fine for non payment of revenue 2 This additional paragraph is found in Bombay Secret Abstracts.
('16', 355, 0, 1, 785749) 356 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 355, 1, 2, 785791) In fact revenue should be paid from the sale value of the crops; it is intolerable, when the crops have failed, that the Government should recover it forcibly.
('16', 355, 1, 3, 785951) But, in this country, it has become a practice with the Government to insist that it is always in the right.
('16', 355, 1, 4, 786060) It is intolerable that, however just the people’s case, the Government should have its own way.
('16', 355, 1, 5, 786156) Justice must prevail and injustice yield.
('16', 355, 1, 6, 786198) The agriculturists claim, and the evidence collected by those who conducted the inquiry bears them out, that the crops have failed and yet the Government insists that they have been plentiful.
('16', 355, 1, 7, 786391) In the circumstances, the people have every right to tell the Government that, surely, they could see and judge things as well as the Government, and that they would not submit to injustice done by the officers.
('16', 355, 1, 8, 786603) That people would tell lies, for the sake of saving at the most a year’s interest by asking for a postponement of the assessment, is inconceivable.
('16', 355, 1, 9, 786751) That the officers should suggest anything of the kind is intolerable.
('16', 355, 1, 10, 786821) We must show, therefore, that our case is just; placed in the situation that we are, I would tell you that, if the Government does not accept our request, we should declare plainly that we shall not pay land revenue and will be prepared to take the consequences.
('16', 355, 1, 11, 787084) All nations which have risen have done so through suffering.
('16', 355, 1, 12, 787145) If the people have to sacrifice their land, they should be ready to do so and suffer.
('16', 355, 1, 13, 787231) Some will even argue that this is treason or rebellion; it is nothing of the kind.
('16', 355, 1, 14, 787314) It means suffering ourselves, no treason.
('16', 355, 1, 15, 787356) When the crops have failed, to pay up the dues out of fear is cowardice.
('16', 355, 1, 16, 787429) We are human beings, not animals.
('16', 355, 1, 17, 787463) To refuse a thing firmly and plainly in the name of truth—that is satyagraha.
('16', 355, 1, 18, 787541) We have assembled today to do the spade work for satyagraha.
('16', 355, 1, 19, 787602) We don’t propose to pay up the revenue to the Government; we want to fight it out.
('16', 355, 1, 20, 787685) We have to prepare ourselves, then, for the suffering that may follow.
('16', 355, 1, 21, 787756) We must visualize what we shall have to face: (1) The Government may recover the assessment by selling our cattle and our movable property.
('16', 355, 1, 22, 787896) (2) It may impose fines.
('16', 355, 1, 23, 787921) (3) It may confiscate jagirs.
('16', 355, 1, 24, 787951) (4) It may even put people in jail on the ground that they are defiant 1. The word has been used by the Government and I don’t like it.
('16', 355, 2, 25, 788087) 1 The Gujarati original has dandai.
('16', 356, 0, 1, 788123) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 357
('16', 356, 1, 2, 788169) How can they say that you are defiant merely because you speak the truth?
('16', 356, 1, 3, 788243) Indeed, such a person is brave, not defiant.
('16', 356, 1, 4, 788288) It is an act of bravery, and no defiance, for a man who, though he can afford to pay, refuses to do so in the interests of the poor.
('16', 356, 1, 5, 788421) If in the process this man has to leave the village for ever, he will do so; he alone may take the pledge today who is ready for this.
('16', 356, 1, 6, 788556) It is very difficult to take the pledge of satyagraha; it is still more difficult to carry out one.
('16', 356, 1, 7, 788656) I cannot bear to think of any one breaking a pledge once taken, forsaking his God.
('16', 356, 1, 8, 788739) It would cause me very great pain, indeed, if you took a pledge which you did not mean to keep.
('16', 356, 1, 9, 788835) In the intensity of my suffering, I may take an extreme step.
('16', 356, 1, 10, 788897) I may have to fast.
('16', 356, 1, 11, 788917) I don’t suffer when I fast; fasting hurts me less than that people should deceive me by breaking their pledge.
('16', 356, 1, 12, 789028) In satyagraha, a pledge is the most valuable thing of all; it must be kept up to the very end.
('16', 356, 1, 13, 789123) A pledge taken in God’s name must never be broken.
('16', 356, 1, 14, 789174) I would not hesitate to sacrifice my life if that might ensure that thousands would keep their pledge.
('16', 356, 1, 15, 789277) Those who want to fight must make up their minds once for all.
('16', 356, 1, 16, 789340) I would not mind very much if people just said that they would hold out as long as possible but that they were not sure of themselves in case of severe repression.
('16', 356, 1, 17, 789504) I would far rather that they cut my throat than that they break my heart by betraying their pledge.
('16', 356, 1, 18, 789604) The man who cuts my throat, I would pray to God to forgive, but I would not forgive the other man.
('16', 356, 1, 19, 789703) I would tell you, therefore, in all humility, whatever you decide, do so with full thought and consideration.
('16', 356, 1, 20, 789813) Only those who are determined to carry their decision through are able to raise themselves.
('16', 356, 1, 21, 789905) When you have so raised yourselves, the Government will respect you, for it will know then, that it was dealing with men who would honour their plighted word and not betray it.
('16', 356, 1, 22, 790082) A man who breaks his word can do no service to his country, or to his Government or to God.
('16', 356, 1, 23, 790174) I want, therefore, to know whether you agree; I ask you: “Are you ready to fight ?” I shall prepare a written pledge.
('16', 356, 1, 24, 790292) Those friends who wish to take it should come to the Ashram and give their signatures.
('16', 356, 1, 25, 790379) I have only one request: “Suffer everything and honour the pledge; refuse to pay the revenue and prove to the Government thereby that you are prepared for sacrifices.” The Government cannot use force against everyone.

('16', 357, 6, 10, 791083) Our village has had crops under four annas.
('16', 357, 6, 11, 791127) We therefore requested the Government to postpone collection to the next year, but they did not do so.
('16', 357, 6, 12, 791230) We the undersigned therefore solemnly declare that we shall not pay the assessment for the year whether it be wholly or in part; we shall leave it to the Government to take any legal steps they choose to enforce recovery of the same and we shall undergo all the sufferings that this may involve.
('16', 357, 6, 13, 791526) We shall also allow our lands to be confiscated should they do so.
('16', 357, 6, 14, 791593) But we shall not by voluntary payment allow ourselves to be regarded as liars and thus lose our self respect.
('16', 357, 6, 15, 791703) If the Government would graciously postpone for all the remaining villages collection of the balance of the revenue, we, who can afford it, would be prepared to pay up revenue, whether it be in full or in part.
('16', 357, 6, 16, 791914) The reason why the well to do amongst us would not pay is that, if they do, the needy ones would, out of fright, sell their chattels or incur debts and pay the revenue and thus suffer.
('16', 357, 6, 17, 792099) We believe that it is the duty of the well to do to protect the needy against such a plight.

('16', 358, 2, 3, 792489) STEPHEN’S COLLEGE, DELHI, March 25, 1918
('16', 358, 3, 4, 792530) TO THE PRIVATE SECRETARY TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE VICEROY
('16', 358, 4, 5, 792585) I can’t describe to you how much disturbed I have been over this affair of Ali brothers, but our talk of this morning has given me much comfort and relief.
('16', 358, 4, 6, 792741) It was a pleasure to see that you had grasped my point in a moment.
('16', 358, 4, 7, 792809) It would be a wonderful act on the part of the Government if, without the knowledge of anybody, an order was sent for their discharge.
('16', 358, 4, 8, 792944) Such a manner of discharging them would avoid all delirious demonstration that would otherwise inevitably take place to receive them.
('16', 358, 4, 9, 793078) These are some of the reasons for their discharge: (a) If they are kept interned in order that they may not do anything hostile to the Government, the idea is frustrated because they do correspond with, and otherwise send messages to, whomsoever they choose.
('16', 358, 4, 10, 793337) (b) Their detention only increases their influence day after day.
('16', 358, 4, 11, 793403) (c) Their detention embitters the feelings of their friends and deepens the discontent of Mahomedans in general, which the Hindus too share to a certain extent.
('16', 358, 4, 12, 793564) (d) Moulana Abdul Bari Saheb is a man wielding tremendous power over thousands of Mussalmans.
('16', 358, 4, 13, 793658) He is their spiritual adviser and the Government would make him theirs by releasing the brothers.
('16', 358, 4, 14, 793756) (e) The brothers are, so far as I am aware, men with a strong will, of noble birth, men of culture and learning, possessing great influence over the educated Mahomedans, open minded and straightforward.
('16', 358, 4, 15, 793959) It was a great mistake to have interned them.
('16', 358, 4, 16, 794005) Surely the Government have ever need of such men on their side.
('16', 358, 4, 17, 794069) Lastly in my humble opinion nothing can possibly be gained by keeping them under detention.
('16', 359, 0, 1, 794161) 360 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 359, 1, 2, 794203) It will be worthy of a great Government to discharge them whilst all the clamour and agitation for their release are under suspense.

('16', 359, 4, 10, 794740) THE DUTY OF THE RYOTS OF KAIRA DISTRICT
('16', 359, 5, 11, 794780) As the crops in the Kaira district have been poor, that is to say, below 4 annas in most of the villages, the Government rule is that the collection of Land Revenue this year should be postponed.
('16', 359, 5, 12, 794976) Repeated appeals have been made to the Government on behalf of the ryots to make this postponement.
('16', 359, 5, 13, 795076) On behalf of the people the Gujarat Sabha, the honourable Messrs G. K. Parekh and V. J. Patel and Messrs Deodhar, Amritlal Thakkar and Joshi of the Servants of India Society made inquiries about the crops and all came to the conclusions that the Kharif crop practically came to nothing.
('16', 359, 5, 14, 795363) With the help of many responsible and respectable assistants, I also made minute inquiries into the crops of about 400 villages and found the same thing that, in almost all the villages the anna valuation was below four annas.
('16', 359, 5, 15, 795590) I also saw that many of the ryots had no money, and that the granaries of many were empty; further that many poor people were importing maize whole sale from outside in place of grain grown in this district and living on that.
('16', 359, 5, 16, 795817) I evensaw this, that wherever the people had paid

('16', 359, 6, 18, 795904) 2 The circular, originally in Gujarati, was resproduced in Gujarati, 31 3 1918. According to the District Magistrate of Kheda, whose note is available in Bombay Secret Abstracts, Gandhiji was busy issuing circulars since his return to Nadiad from Delhi on March 27. The first one which was reported to have been posted all over the district, and which is not available, asked farmers to communicate to Gandhiji details of coercive official measures.
('16', 359, 6, 19, 796354) This was another circular issued by Gandhiji.

('16', 360, 1, 3, 796516) At several places people had paid the land revenue by selling their trees, etc.
('16', 360, 1, 4, 796596) It also came to my notice that the people were groaning under the burden of extremely high prices.
('16', 360, 1, 5, 796695) Further the people, through fear of plague, are living in huts in a state of anxiety.
('16', 360, 1, 6, 796781) 1 All these facts have been explained to the Collector and the Commissioner; they have made certain concessions but these are of no account in comparison with the necessities of the people.
('16', 360, 1, 7, 796971) In such circumstances, only one piece of advice can be given to the people, and it is this that in order to prove their truthfulness, they should not pay the land revenue but let Government collect the land revenue by selling their property if it so desires.
('16', 360, 1, 8, 797230) It is more advisable to lose all by not paying the land revenue than to pay it up through fear and so prove false.
('16', 360, 1, 9, 797345) At any rate, this is my definite advice to the people, they should certainly not pay the land revenue and they should bear all the suffering and oppressions (zulum) that may result.
('16', 360, 1, 10, 797527) Government is bound to respect popular opinion, and it is only if people act in this way that Government will learn to respect it.
('16', 360, 1, 11, 797658) Many leading gentlemen are ready to assist the people in this struggle, and even if anyone is turned out of house and home, arrangements have been made for his food and lodging.
('16', 360, 1, 12, 797836) Forms of pledge for the signatures of those who have courage enough not to pay the assessment have already been issued, and it is hoped that all agriculturists who have not paid will sign it.
('16', 360, 1, 13, 798028) My advice is to think well before signing, but it should be remembered that after signing whatever may happen there can be no going back.

('16', 361, 1, 2, 798307) 243. LETTER TO THE PRESS 1
('16', 361, 3, 3, 798334) TO THE EDITOR THE LEADER ALLAHABAD
('16', 361, 4, 4, 798369) SIR, Perhaps I owe an explanation to the public with regard to my recent fast.
('16', 361, 4, 5, 798448) Some friends consider the action to have been silly, others cowardly and some others still worse.
('16', 361, 4, 6, 798546) In my opinion, I would have been untrue to my Maker and to the cause I was espousing, if I had acted otherwise.
('16', 361, 4, 7, 798658) When over a month ago I reached Bombay, I was told that Ahmedabad mill hands had threatened a strike and violence if the bonus that was given to them during the plague was withdrawn.
('16', 361, 4, 8, 798841) I was asked to intervene and I consented.
('16', 361, 4, 9, 798883) Owing to the plague the men were getting as much as 70 per cent bonus since August last.
('16', 361, 4, 10, 798972) An attempt to recall that bonus had resulted in grave dissatisfaction among the labourers.
('16', 361, 4, 11, 799063) When it was almost too late, the mill owners offered in the place of the plague bonus and for the sake of the high prices a rise of 20 percent.
('16', 361, 4, 12, 799207) The labourers were unsatisfied.
('16', 361, 4, 13, 799239) The matter was referred to arbitration, Mr. Chatfield, the collector, being the umpire.
('16', 361, 4, 14, 799327) The men in some mills however struck work.
('16', 361, 4, 15, 799370) The owners, thinking that they had done so without just cause, withdrew from the arbitration and declared a general lock out to be continued till the labourers were exhausted into accepting 20 per cent increase they had offered.
('16', 361, 4, 16, 799599) Messrs Shankarlal Banker, V. J. Patel and I, the arbitrators appointed on behalf of the labourers thought that they were to be demoralized if we did not act promptly and decisively.
('16', 361, 4, 17, 799781) We, therefore, investigated the question of increase they had offered.
('16', 361, 4, 18, 799852) We sought the mill owners’ assistance.
('16', 361, 4, 19, 799891) They would not give it.
('16', 361, 4, 20, 799915) Their one purpose was to organize themselves into a combination that could fight a similar combination of their employees.
('16', 361, 4, 21, 800038) One sided technically though our investigation was, we endeavoured to examine the mill owners’ side and came to the conclusion that a 35 percent increase was fair.
('16', 361, 4, 22, 800202) Before announcing the figure to the mill hands, we informed the employers of the result

('16', 362, 1, 2, 800434) of our inquiry and told them that we would correct ourselves if they could show any error.
('16', 362, 1, 3, 800525) The latter would not co operate.
('16', 362, 1, 4, 800558) They sent a reply saying as much, but they pointed out in it that the rate of increase granted by the Government as also the employers in Bombay was much less than the one contemplated by us.
('16', 362, 1, 5, 800750) I felt that the addendum was beside the point and at a huge meeting 1 announced 35 per cent for the mill hands’ acceptance.
('16', 362, 1, 6, 800874) Be it noted that the plague bonus amounted to 70 per cent of their wages and they had declared their intention of accepting not less than 50 per cent as high prices increase.
('16', 362, 1, 7, 801049) They were now called upon to accept the mean (the fixing of the mean was quite an accident) between the mill owners 20 per cent, and their own 50 per cent.
('16', 362, 1, 8, 801205) After some grumbling, the meeting accepted the 35 per cent increase, it always being understood that they would recognize, at the same time, the principle of arbitration whenever the mill owners’ did so.
('16', 362, 1, 9, 801409) From that time forward, i.e., 26th February last, day after day thousands of people gathered together under the shade of a tree outside the city walls, people walking long distances in many cases, and solemnly repeated their determination in the name of God not to accept anything less than 35 per cent.
('16', 362, 1, 10, 801713) No pecuniary assistance was given to them.
('16', 362, 1, 11, 801756) It was easy enough to understand that many must suffer from the pangs of starvation and that they could not, while they were without employment, get any credit.
('16', 362, 1, 12, 801917) We who were helping them came, on the other hand, to the conclusion that we would only spoil them if we collected public funds and utilized them for feeding them unless the able bodied among them were ready to perform bread labour.
('16', 362, 1, 13, 802149) It was a difficult task to persuade men, who have worked at machines, to shoulder baskets of sand or bricks.
('16', 362, 1, 14, 802258) They came but they did so grudgingly.
('16', 362, 1, 15, 802296) The mill owners hardened their hearts.
('16', 362, 1, 16, 802335) They were equally determined not to go beyond 20 per cent and they appointed emissaries to persuade the men to give in.
('16', 362, 1, 17, 802455) Even during the early part of the lock out, whilst we had declined to help those who would not work, we had assured them that we would feed and clothe ourselves after feeding and clothing them.
('16', 362, 1, 18, 802649) Twenty two days had passed by.
('16', 362, 1, 19, 802680) Hunger and the mill owners’ emissaries were producing their effect and Satan was whispering to the men that there was no such thing as God on earth who would help them and that vows were dodges resorted to by weaklings.

('16', 363, 1, 2, 803068) thousand men with determination written on their faces, I met a body of 2000 men with despair written on their faces.
('16', 363, 1, 3, 803186) We had just heard that mill hands living in a particular chawl had declined to attend the meeting, were preparing to go to work and accept 20 per cent increase and were taunting us (I think very properly) that it was very well for us who had motors at our disposal and plenty of food, to attend their meetings and advise staunchness even unto death.
('16', 363, 1, 4, 803536) What was I to do?
('16', 363, 1, 5, 803554) I held the cause to be just.
('16', 363, 1, 6, 803583) I believe in God as I believe that I am writing this letter.
('16', 363, 1, 7, 803644) I believe in the necessity of the performance of one’s promise at all costs.
('16', 363, 1, 8, 803721) I knew that the men before us were God fearing men, but that the long drawn out lock out or strike was putting an undue strain upon them.
('16', 363, 1, 9, 803859) I had the knowledge before me during my extensive travels in India, hundreds of people were found who as readily broke a promise as they made them.
('16', 363, 1, 10, 804007) I knew, too, that the best of us have but a vague and indistinct belief in soul force and in God.
('16', 363, 1, 11, 804105) I felt that it was a sacred moment for me, my faith was on the anvil, and I had no hesitation to rising and declaring to the men that a breach of their vow so solemnly taken was unendurable by me and that I would not take any food until they had the 35 per cent increase given or until they had fallen.
('16', 363, 1, 12, 804408) A meeting that was up to now unlike the former meetings, totally unresponsive, woke up as if by magic.
('16', 363, 1, 13, 804511) Tears trickled down the cheeks of every one of them and men after men rose up saying that they would never go to the mills unless they got the increase and that they would go about the city and steal the hearts of those who had not attended the meeting.
('16', 363, 1, 14, 804765) It was a privilege to witness the demonstration of the efficacy of truth and love.
('16', 363, 1, 15, 804848) Every one immediately realized that the protecting power of God was as much with us today as it used to be in the days of yore.
('16', 363, 1, 16, 804976) I am not sorry for the vow but with the belief that I have, I would have been unworthy of the trust undertaken by me, if I had done anything less.
('16', 363, 1, 17, 805123) Before I took the vow I knew that there were serious defects about it.
('16', 363, 1, 18, 805194) For me to take such a vow in order to affect in any shape or form the decision of the mill owners would be cowardly injustice done to them and that I would prove myself unfit for the friendship which I had the privilege of enjoying with some of them.
('16', 363, 1, 19, 805445) I knew that I ran the risk of being misunderstood.
('16', 363, 1, 20, 805496) I could not prevent my fast from affecting their decision.
('16', 363, 1, 21, 805555) Their knowledge, moreover, put a responsibility on me which I was ill able to bear.
('16', 363, 1, 22, 805639) From now I disabled myself from gaining concessions for the men, which ordinarily, in a struggle such as this, I would be entirely justified in securing.
('16', 363, 1, 23, 805793) I knew, too, that I would have
('16', 364, 0, 1, 805824) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 365
('16', 364, 1, 2, 805870) to be satisfied with the minimum I could get from the mill owners and with a fulfilment of the letter of the men’s vow rather than its spirit and so hath it happened.
('16', 364, 1, 3, 806037) I put the effect of my vow in one scale and the merits of it in the other.
('16', 364, 1, 4, 806112) There are hardly any acts of human beings which are free from all taint.
('16', 364, 1, 5, 806185) Mine, I know, was exceptionally tainted but I preferred the ignominy of having unworthily compromised by my vow the position and independence of the mill owners rather than that it should be said by posterity that 10,000 men had suddenly broken a vow which they had for over twenty days solemnly taken and repeated in the name of God.
('16', 364, 1, 6, 806520) I am fully convinced that no body of men can make themselves into a nation or perform great tasks unless they become as true as steel and unless their promises come to be regarded by the world like the law of the Medes and Persians, inflexible and unbreakable, and whatever may be the verdict of friends, so far as I can think at present, on given occasions I should not hesitate in future to repeat the humble performance which I have taken the liberty of describing in this communication.
('16', 364, 2, 7, 807011) I cannot conclude this letter without mentioning two names of whom India has every reason to be proud.
('16', 364, 2, 8, 807114) The mill owners were represented by Mr. Ambalal Sarabhai who is a gentlemen in every sense of the term.
('16', 364, 2, 9, 807218) He is a man of culture and equally great abilities.
('16', 364, 2, 10, 807270) He adds to these qualities a resolute will.
('16', 364, 2, 11, 807314) The mill hands were represented by his sister Anasuyabehn.
('16', 364, 2, 12, 807373) She possesses a heart of gold.
('16', 364, 2, 13, 807404) She is full of pity for the poor.
('16', 364, 2, 14, 807438) The mill hands adore her.
('16', 364, 2, 15, 807464) Her word is law with them.
('16', 364, 2, 16, 807491) I have not known a struggle fought with so little bitterness and such courtesy on either side.
('16', 364, 2, 17, 807586) This happy result is principally due to the connections with it of Mr. Ambalal Sarabhai and Anasuyabehn.

('16', 365, 3, 4, 807831) You will forgive me for not writing to you earlier.
('16', 365, 3, 5, 807883) I hope Girdhari gave you my message.
('16', 365, 3, 6, 807920) I wanted to give you a letter that would bring you peace and joy.
('16', 365, 3, 7, 807986) And I waited.
('16', 365, 3, 8, 808000) I may have failed to give you such a letter even now.
('16', 365, 3, 9, 808054) But I can no longer keep back writing to you.
('16', 365, 3, 10, 808100) Your own letter pouring forth the soul’s agony stares me in the face.
('16', 365, 3, 11, 808170) But should death, even when it overtakes our dearest so suddenly, as it has done in your brother’s case, paralyse us?
('16', 365, 3, 12, 808288) Is it not only “a change and a forgetting”?
('16', 365, 3, 13, 808332) Is it any the less so when it comes all of a sudden?
('16', 365, 3, 14, 808385) You have been called to a privileged position.
('16', 365, 3, 15, 808432) Your faith and your philosophy are on their trial.
('16', 365, 3, 16, 808483) If you feed by honest means two hungry mouths of your family, you are performing a truly national service.
('16', 365, 3, 17, 808590) What will happen to India if all the bread winners turned so called servants of India?
('16', 365, 3, 18, 808677) You will only now be weighed in the balance and I know you will not be found wanting.
('16', 365, 3, 19, 808763) All your friends also are now on their trial.
('16', 365, 3, 20, 808809) Pray let me know of your plans.
('16', 365, 3, 21, 808841) If you can, do come to see me, and we shall discuss them.
('16', 365, 3, 22, 808899) Any assistance I can render is, you know, yours.

('16', 365, 8, 28, 809105) NADIAD, March 28, 1918
('16', 365, 9, 29, 809128) In the district of Kheda, the crops for the year 1917 18 have, by common admission, proved a partial failure.
('16', 365, 9, 30, 809238) Under the Revenue rules
('16', 365, 10, 31, 809262) 1 This was in reply to Kripalani’s letter conveying news about the deaths of his brother and sister in law and expressing the fear that he might have to give up social service.

('16', 366, 1, 2, 809591) if the crops are under four annas, the cultivators are entitled to full suspension of the Revenue assessment for the year; if the crops are under six annas, half the amount of assessment is suspended.
('16', 366, 1, 3, 809792) So far as I am aware, the Government have been pleased to grant full suspension with regard to one village out of every 600, and half suspension in the case of over 103 villages.
('16', 366, 1, 4, 809971) It is claimed on behalf of the ryots that the suspension is not at all adequate to the actuality.
('16', 366, 1, 5, 810069) The government contended that in the vast majority of villages, crops have been over six annas.
('16', 366, 1, 6, 810165) The only question before at issue is, whether the crops have been under four annas or six annas, as the case may be, or over the latter figure.
('16', 366, 1, 7, 810309) Government valuation is in the first instance made by the Talatis assisted by the chief men of the villages concerned.
('16', 366, 1, 8, 810428) As a rule, no check on thier figures is considered necessary, for it is only during partial failure that Government valuation of crops may have been challenged.
('16', 366, 1, 9, 810589) The Talatis are as a class obsequious, unscrupulous and tyrannical.
('16', 366, 1, 10, 810657) The chief men are especially selected for their docility.
('16', 366, 1, 11, 810715) The Talatis’ one aim is naturally to collect full assessment as promptly as possible.
('16', 366, 1, 12, 810801) We sometimes read accounts of assiduous Talatis having been awarded pugree for making full collection.
('16', 366, 1, 13, 810904) In applying to the Talatis the adjectives I have given, I wish to cast no reflections on them as men.
('16', 366, 1, 14, 811006) I merely state the fact.
('16', 366, 1, 15, 811031) The Talatis are not born; they are made; and rent collectors all the world over have to cultivate a callousness without which they could not do their work to the satisfaction of their masters.
('16', 366, 1, 16, 811224) It is impossible for me to reproduce the graphic description given by the ryots of the rent collectors which the Talatis chiefly are.
('16', 366, 1, 17, 811358) My purpose in dealing with the Talatis is to show that the Governments valuation of the crops is derived in the first instance from the tainted source and is presumably biased against the ryots.
('16', 366, 1, 18, 811553) As against their valuation, we have the universal testimony of ryots, high and low, some of whom are men of position and considerable wealth, who have a reputation to lose and who have nothing to gain by exaggeration except the odium of Talatis and possibly higher officials.
('16', 366, 1, 19, 811829) I wish to state at once that behind this movement there is no desire to discredit the Government, or an individual official.
('16', 366, 1, 20, 811954) The movement is intended to assert the right of the people to be effectively heard in matters concerning themselves.
('16', 366, 2, 21, 812071) It is known to the public that the Hon’ble Mr. G. K. Parekh and Mr. V. J. Patel, invited and assisted by the Gujarat Sabha, carried on investigations as also Messrs Deodhar, Joshi and Thakkar of the Servants of India Society.
('16', 366, 2, 22, 812297) Their investigation was necessary
('16', 367, 0, 1, 812331) 368 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 367, 1, 2, 812373) preliminary and brief and therefore confined to a few villages only.
('16', 367, 1, 3, 812442) But the result of their inquiry went to show that the crops in the majority of cases was under four annas.
('16', 367, 1, 4, 812549) As their investigation, not being extensive enough, was capable of being challenged, and it was challenged.
('16', 367, 1, 5, 812657) I undertook a full inquiry with the assistance of over 20 capable, experienced and impartial men of influence and status.
('16', 367, 1, 6, 812779) I personally visited over 50 villages and met as many men in the villages as I could, inspected in these villages most of the fields belonging to them and after a searching cross examination of the villagers, came to the conclusion that their crops were under four annas.
('16', 367, 1, 7, 813051) I found that among the men who surrounded me, there were present those who were ready to check exaggerations and wild statements.
('16', 367, 1, 8, 813181) Men knew what was at stake if they departed from the truth.
('16', 367, 1, 9, 813241) As to the rabi crops and the still standing Kharif crops, I was able by the evidence of my own eyes to check the statements of the agriculturists.
('16', 367, 1, 10, 813388) The method adopted by my co workers were exactly the same.
('16', 367, 1, 11, 813447) In this manner nearly 400 villages were examined and with but a few exceptions, crops were found to be under four annas, and only in three cases they were found to be over six annas.
('16', 367, 1, 12, 813630) The method adopted by us was, so far as the Kharif crops were concerned, to ascertain the actual yield of the whole of the crops of individual villages and the possible yield of the same village in a normal year.
('16', 367, 1, 13, 813843) Assuming the truth of the statements made by them, this is admittedly an absolute test, and any other method that would bring about the same result must be rejected as untrue and unscientific; and as I have already remarked, all probability of exaggeration was avoided in the above named investigation.
('16', 367, 1, 14, 814146) As to the standing rabi crops, there was the eye estimate and it was tested by the method above mentioned.
('16', 367, 1, 15, 814253) The Government method is an eye estimate and therefore a matter largely of guess work.
('16', 367, 1, 16, 814340) It is moreover open to fundamental objections which I have endeavoured to set forth in a letter to the Collector of the District.
('16', 367, 1, 17, 814470) I request him to treat Vadthal a well known and ordinary well to do village of the district with the railway line passing by it and which is near a trade centre as a test case and I suggest that if the crops were in that village proved to be under four annas, as I hold they were, it might be assumed that in other villages less fortunately situated, crops were not likely to be more than four annas.
('16', 367, 1, 18, 814871) I have added to my request a suggestion that I should be permitted to be present at the inquiry.
('16', 367, 1, 19, 814968) He made the inquiry but rejected my suggestion and therefore it proved to be one sided.
('16', 367, 1, 20, 815056) The Collector has made an elaborate report on the crops of that village which, in my opinion, I have successfully challenged.
('16', 367, 1, 21, 815182) The original Government valuation, I understand, was twelve annas, the Collector’s minimum
('16', 368, 0, 1, 815273) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 369
('16', 368, 1, 2, 815319) valuation is seven annas.
('16', 368, 1, 3, 815345) If the probably wrong methods of valuation to which I have drawn attention and which have been adopted by the Collector are allowed for, the valuation according to his own reckoning would come under six annas and according to the agriculturists it would be under four annas.
('16', 368, 1, 4, 815620) Both the report and my answer are too technical to be of value to the public.
('16', 368, 1, 5, 815698) But I have suggested that, as both the Government and agriculturists hold themselves in the right, if the Government have any regard for popular opinion, they should appoint an impartial committee of inquiry with the cultivators’ representatives upon it, or gracefully accept the popular view.
('16', 368, 1, 6, 815992) The Government have rejected both the suggestions and insist upon applying coercive measures for the collection of revenue.
('16', 368, 1, 7, 816116) It may be mentioned that these measures have never been totally suspended and in many cases the ryots have paid simply under pressure.
('16', 368, 1, 8, 816251) The Talatis have taken away cattle and have returned them only after the payment of assessment.
('16', 368, 1, 9, 816347) In one case, I witnessed a painful incident.
('16', 368, 1, 10, 816392) A man having a milch buffalo taken away from him and it was only on my happening to go to the village that the buffalo was released; this buffalo was the most valuable property the man possessed and a source of daily bread for him.
('16', 368, 1, 11, 816624) Scores of such cases have already happened and many more will no doubt happen hereafter if the public opinion is not ranged on the side of the people.
('16', 368, 1, 12, 816775) Every means of seeking redress by prayers has been exhausted.
('16', 368, 1, 13, 816837) Interviews with Collector, the Commissioner and His Excellency have taken place.
('16', 368, 1, 14, 816918) The final suggestion that was made is this; Although in the majority of cases, people are entitled to full suspension, half suspension should be granted throughout the district except for villages which show, by common consent, crops over six annas.
('16', 368, 1, 15, 817168) Such a gracious concession may be accompanied by a declaration that the Government would expect those who have ready means voluntarily to pay the dues, we the workers on our part undertaking to persuade such people to pay up the Government dues.
('16', 368, 1, 16, 817414) This will leave only the poorest people untouched.
('16', 368, 1, 17, 817465) I venture to submit that acceptance of this suggestion can only bring credit and strength to the Government.
('16', 368, 1, 18, 817574) Resistance of popular will can only produce discontent which, in the case of fear stricken peasantry such as of Kaira, can only find an underground passage and thus demoralize them.
('16', 368, 1, 19, 817756) The present movement is an attempt to get out of such a false position, humiliating alike for the Government and the people.
('16', 368, 1, 20, 817881) And how do the Government propose to assert their position and so called prestige?
('16', 368, 1, 21, 817964) They have a Revenue Code giving them unlimited powers without a right of appeal to the ryots against the decisions of the Revenue Authorities.
('16', 368, 1, 22, 818107) Exercise of these powers in a case like the one
('16', 369, 0, 1, 818155) 370 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 369, 1, 2, 818197) before us, in which the ryots are fighting for a principle and the authorities for prestige, would be a prostitution of justice, of a disavowal of all fair play.
('16', 369, 1, 3, 818359) These powers are: (1) Right of summary execution.
('16', 369, 1, 4, 818409) (2) Right of exacting a quarter of the assessment as punishment.
('16', 369, 1, 5, 818474) (3) Right of confiscation of land, not merely rayatwari but even inami or sanadia, and the right of keeping a man under hajat.
('16', 369, 2, 6, 818601) Those remedies may be applied singly or all together, and unbelievable though it may seem to the public, it may be mentioned that the notices of the application of all these remedies but the last have been issued.
('16', 369, 2, 7, 818815) Thus a man owning two hundred acres of land in perpetuity and valued at thousands of rupees, paying a small assessment rate, may at will of the authority lose the whole of it, because for the sake of principal he respectfully refuses voluntarily to pay the assessment himself and is prepared meekly but under strong protest to penalties that may be inflicted by law.
('16', 369, 2, 8, 819182) Surely vindictive confiscation of property ought not to be the reward for orderly disobedience which, properly handled, can only result in progress all roung and in giving the Government a bold and frank peasantry with a will of its own.
('16', 369, 2, 9, 819420) I venture to invite the Press and the public to assist these cultivators of Kaira who have dared to enter up a fight for what they consider is just and right.
('16', 369, 2, 10, 819579) Let the public remember this also that unprecedentedly severe plague has decimated the population of Kaira.
('16', 369, 2, 11, 819687) People are living outside their homes in specially prepared thatched cottages at considerable expense to themselves.
('16', 369, 2, 12, 819804) In some villages mortality has been tremendous.
('16', 369, 2, 13, 819852) Prices areruling high of which, owing to the failure of crops, they can but take little advantage and have to suffer all the disadvantages thereof.
('16', 369, 2, 14, 820000) It is not money they want so much as the voice of a strong unanimous and emphatic public opinion.

('16', 370, 2, 3, 820259) [INDORE, March 29, 1918]
('16', 370, 3, 4, 820284) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, Our most venerable and selfless leader Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya has not found it possible to attend this conference.
('16', 370, 3, 5, 820426) I had requested him to come if he could and he promised to do so.
('16', 370, 3, 6, 820492) But though he has not been able to come he has sent us a letter.
('16', 370, 3, 7, 820557) I was sure that in case he did not come, he would send a letter stating his views, and it would be possible for me to read it out to you.
('16', 370, 3, 8, 820695) I have received the letter today.
('16', 370, 3, 9, 820729) I had asked the reception committee to secure views of scholars on two questions in regard to Hindi.
('16', 370, 3, 10, 820830) Panditji in his letter has replied to these two questions.
('16', 370, 4, 11, 820889) The question of language presents a big and indeed a very important problem.
('16', 370, 4, 12, 820966) Even if all the leaders were to devote themselves entirely to this task turning away from everything else, they well may.
('16', 370, 4, 13, 821088) If on the other hand, we were to regard it as of secondary importance only and to direct our attention away from it then all the enthusiasm which people now feel for it and the keen interest they are taking in it at present would be in vain.
('16', 370, 4, 14, 821330) Language is like our mother.
('16', 370, 4, 15, 821359) In fact I have no real interest in this sort of a conference.
('16', 370, 4, 16, 821421) It will be a three days’ pageant after which we shall disperse, go away to our respective places and forget all that we said or heard.
('16', 370, 4, 17, 821556) What is needed is the urge and the resolve to do things.
('16', 370, 4, 18, 821613) The president’s speech cannot give you that urge.
('16', 370, 4, 19, 821663) It is something which you have to create for yourselves.
('16', 370, 4, 20, 821720) One of the charges made against us is that our language lacks spirit.
('16', 370, 4, 21, 821790) Where there is no knowledge there is no spirit.
('16', 370, 4, 22, 821838) We have neither the urge to know nor to do things.
('16', 370, 4, 23, 821889) It is only when we acquire dynamic energy that our people and our language also will acquire it.
('16', 370, 4, 24, 821986) We cannot get the freedom we want through a foreign language for the simple reason that we are not able to use it effectively.
('16', 370, 4, 25, 822113) I am pleased to know that in Indore you carry on all your dealings through Hindi.
('16', 370, 4, 26, 822195) But – excuse me please –the letter I have received from your Chief Minister is in
('16', 370, 5, 27, 822277) 1 Gandhiji delivered this address in Hindi while presiding over the 8 th session of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan held at the Town Hall, Indore.
('16', 370, 5, 28, 822419) 2 At this point, Gandhiji read out Pandit Malaviya’s letter expressing his conviction that Hindi was the lingua franca of India.
('16', 371, 0, 1, 822548) 372 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 371, 1, 2, 822590) English.
('16', 371, 1, 3, 822599) The people of Indore perhaps do not know—but I will tell them—that here the courts entertain petitions written in English.
('16', 371, 1, 4, 822722) I ask why it should be so in Indore.
('16', 371, 1, 5, 822759) I admit that this movement—the movement for the adoption of Hindi—cannot yet succeed in British India, but there is no reason why it should not succeed in the Indian States.
('16', 371, 1, 6, 822933) The educated classes, as Pandit Malaviyaji has pointed out in his letter, have unfortunately fallen under the spell of English and have developed a distaste for their own mother tongue,.
('16', 371, 1, 7, 823120) The milk one gets from the former is adulterated with water and contaminated with poison, while that from the latter is pure.
('16', 371, 1, 8, 823246) It is impossible to make any advance without this pure milk.
('16', 371, 1, 9, 823307) But a blind person cannot see and a slave does not know how to break his fetters.
('16', 371, 1, 10, 823389) We have been living under the spell of the English now for the past fifty years.
('16', 371, 1, 11, 823470) In the result our people have remained steeped in ignorance.
('16', 371, 1, 12, 823531) The conference must give special attention to this part of the problem.
('16', 371, 1, 13, 823603) We should see that within a year conditions are created when not a word of English will be heard in any of our political or social conferences, in the Congress, in the provincial assemblies and the like.
('16', 371, 1, 14, 823807) Let us abandon the use of English entirely.
('16', 371, 1, 15, 823851) English has attained the position of a universal language.
('16', 371, 1, 16, 823910) But that is because the English have spread and established themselves throughout the world.
('16', 371, 1, 17, 824003) As soon as they lose that position, English will shrink in its extent.
('16', 371, 1, 18, 824074) We should no more neglect and thus destroy our own language.
('16', 371, 1, 19, 824135) The English insist on speaking their mother tongue and using it for all their purposes.
('16', 371, 1, 20, 824223) Let us do the same and thus raise Hindi to the high status of a national language.
('16', 371, 1, 21, 824306) Only thus shall we discharge our duty to it.
('16', 371, 1, 22, 824351) Now I will read out my written speech.
('16', 371, 2, 23, 824390) MR. PRESIDENT, DELEGATES, BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
('16', 371, 3, 24, 824438) You have done me great honour in conferring on me the presidentship of this conference.
('16', 371, 3, 25, 824526) I know only too well that from the point of view of the knowledge of Hindi, my qualifications for this honour are almost nil.
('16', 371, 3, 26, 824652) The only thing which may be said to qualify me for it is my boundless love of Hindi.
('16', 371, 3, 27, 824737) I hope that I would always be able to pass this test of love.
('16', 371, 3, 28, 824799) The extent of a particular literature can only be reckoned on the basis of the region where that language is spoken.
('16', 371, 3, 29, 824916) If the region of Hindi remains confined to the Northern part of India, the extent of its literature must remain limited.
('16', 371, 3, 30, 825037) But in case it becomes a national language, the expanse of its literature will become as wide as the
('16', 372, 0, 1, 825138) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 373
('16', 372, 1, 2, 825184) country.
('16', 372, 1, 3, 825193) As the people speaking a particular language, so the language.
('16', 372, 1, 4, 825256) If we want that high souled men from the East and the West, from the North and the South, should come to take a dip in the sea of this language, it is obvious that the sea must acquire sufficient importance.
('16', 372, 1, 5, 825464) Therefore the place of Hindi from the point of view of developing a national literature needs to be considered.
('16', 372, 2, 6, 825576) It is necessary to give some thought to the definition of the Hindi language.
('16', 372, 2, 7, 825654) I have often said that Hindi is that language which is spoken in the North by both Hindus and Muslims and which is written either in the Nagari or the Persian script.
('16', 372, 2, 8, 825821) This Hindi is neither too Sanskritized nor too Persianized.
('16', 372, 2, 9, 825881) The sweetness which I find in the village Hindi is found neither in the speech of the Muslims of Lucknow nor in that of the Hindu pundits of Prayag.
('16', 372, 2, 10, 826030) The language which is easily understood by the masses is the best.
('16', 372, 2, 11, 826097) All can easily follow the village Hindi.
('16', 372, 2, 12, 826138) The source of the river of language lies in the Himalayas of the people.
('16', 372, 2, 13, 826211) It will always be so.
('16', 372, 2, 14, 826233) The Ganga arising with the village Hindi which will flow on for ever, while the Sanskritized and Persianized Hindi will dry up and fade away, as does a rivulet springing from a small hillock.
('16', 372, 3, 15, 826425) The distinction made between Hindus and Muslims is unreal.
('16', 372, 3, 16, 826484) The same unreality is found in the distinction between Hindi and Urdu.
('16', 372, 3, 17, 826555) It is unnecessary for Hindus to reject Persian words and for Muslims to reject Sanskrit words from their speech.
('16', 372, 3, 18, 826668) A harmonious blend of the two will be as beautiful as the confluence of the Ganga and Yamuna and last for ever.
('16', 372, 3, 19, 826780) I hope that we will not waste our energy and weaken our strength by entering into the Hindi Urdu controversy.
('16', 372, 3, 20, 826890) There is, no doubt, difficulty in regard to script.
('16', 372, 3, 21, 826942) As things are, Muslims will patronize the Arabic script, while Hindus will mostly use the Nagari script.
('16', 372, 3, 22, 827047) Both scripts will therefore have to be accorded their due places.
('16', 372, 3, 23, 827113) Officials must know both scripts.
('16', 372, 3, 24, 827147) There is no difficulty in this.
('16', 372, 3, 25, 827179) In the end, the script which is theeasier of the two will prevail.
('16', 372, 3, 26, 827246) There is no doubt that there ought to be a common language for mutual intercourse between the different parts of India.
('16', 372, 3, 27, 827366) Once we forget the Hindi Urdu controversy, we shall realize that for Muslims throughout India Urdu is the lingua franca.
('16', 372, 3, 28, 827487) This proves that since Moghul times, Hindi or Urdu was well on its way to becoming the national language of India.
('16', 372, 4, 29, 827602) Even today, there is no language to rival Hindi in this respect.
('16', 372, 4, 30, 827667) The question of national language becomes quite easy of solution
('16', 373, 0, 1, 827732) 374 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 373, 1, 2, 827774) once we give up the Hindi Urdu controversy.
('16', 373, 1, 3, 827818) Hindus will have to learn some Persian words while Muslims will have to learn some Sanskrit words.
('16', 373, 1, 4, 827917) This exchange will enrich and strengthen the Islamic language and provide a very fruitful means for bringing Hindus and Muslims closer together.
('16', 373, 1, 5, 828062) in fact we have to work so hard for dispelling the present fascination for the English language that we must not raise the Hindu Urdu controversy.
('16', 373, 1, 6, 828209) Nor must we fight over the script.
('16', 373, 2, 7, 828244) Why English cannot become our national language, what harm results from the imposition of English on our people, how our people have suffered and their development has been retarded by the adoption of English as the medium of education I have dealt with in my speeches at Broach and Bhagalpur.
('16', 373, 2, 8, 828538) I will not therefore repeat myself here.
('16', 373, 2, 9, 828579) Indeed there is no doubt that Sir Rabindranath Tagore, Smt.
('16', 373, 2, 10, 828639) Besant, Lokamanya Tilak and other respected and influential persons entertain similar views regarding this question.
('16', 373, 2, 11, 828756) There will certainly be difficulties in the way of the achievement of our purpose but it will be for this body to tackle them.
('16', 373, 2, 12, 828883) Lokamanya Tilak has indeed expressed his views in this regard not only in words but also in action by starting a Hindi section in his papers the Kesari and The Mahratta.
('16', 373, 2, 13, 829053) The views of Bharat ratna Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya on this question are well known.
('16', 373, 2, 14, 829140) Still, unfortunately, some of our learned leaders hold that for atleast some years to come English must remain the national language.
('16', 373, 2, 15, 829274) We will respectfully request these leaders to consider that this unreasonable attraction for English is causing much hardship to our people, as they get little benefit out of the knowledge of their English educated countrymen between whom and them a wide gulf has been created through English.
('16', 373, 3, 16, 829568) It is unnecessary to say that I do not hate the English language.
('16', 373, 3, 17, 829634) I myself have benefited from many of the precious gems of the great treasure of English Literature.
('16', 373, 3, 18, 829734) We have also to acquire a knowledge of science and suchlike through the English Language.
('16', 373, 3, 19, 829824) Knowledge of English is therefore necessary for us.
('16', 373, 3, 20, 829876) But it is one thing to give it its due place and quite another to make a fetish of it.
('16', 373, 4, 21, 829963) It is clear that our purpose will not be achieved merely by accepting that Hindi Urdu should be our national language.
('16', 373, 4, 22, 830082) We have to consider how we may achieve this goal.
('16', 373, 4, 23, 830132) The scholars who have graced this assembly by their presence will certainly have something to say on this point.
('16', 373, 4, 24, 830245) I will make a few suggestions on how we may spread this language.
('16', 373, 4, 25, 830311) There must first be a handy book sort of a
('16', 374, 0, 1, 830354) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 375
('16', 374, 1, 2, 830400) “Hindi Teacher” which will meet the needs of those who want to learn Hindi.
('16', 374, 1, 3, 830476) I have seen a small book of this type for those who want to learn Hindi through Bengali.
('16', 374, 1, 4, 830565) There is one in Marathi also.
('16', 374, 1, 5, 830595) But I have not seen any such books for other regional languages.
('16', 374, 1, 6, 830660) This is as easy to do as it is necessary.
('16', 374, 1, 7, 830702) I hope that this Sammelan will soon take up this work.
('16', 374, 1, 8, 830757) Of course, these books should be written by learned and experienced writers.
('16', 374, 2, 9, 830834) The greatest difficulty will be felt in the case of the Southern languages.
('16', 374, 2, 10, 830910) No effort whatever in this direction has yet been made there.
('16', 374, 2, 11, 830972) We must train good Hindi teachers to take up the work.
('16', 374, 2, 12, 831027) There is a great scarcity of such teachers.
('16', 374, 2, 13, 831071) I have secured one such teacher from Prayag through your popular secretary, Bhai Purushottamdasji Tandon.
('16', 374, 3, 14, 831177) Similarly, I have not yet seen a single complete grammar of the Hindi language.
('16', 374, 3, 15, 831257) Such as exist in English and have been written by foreigners.
('16', 374, 3, 16, 831319) One of these grammars is by Dr. Kellog.
('16', 374, 3, 17, 831359) There must be a good Hindi grammar which can compare favourably with similar grammars of other Indian languages.
('16', 374, 3, 18, 831472) It is my humble request to scholars who love Hindi to make up this deficiency.
('16', 374, 3, 19, 831551) In our national Councils Hindi alone should be used.
('16', 374, 3, 20, 831604) Congress workers and leaders can and should do much in this respect.
('16', 374, 3, 21, 831673) I would suggest that this Conference should make a request to this effect to the Congress at its next session.
('16', 374, 4, 22, 831784) In our legislative bodies too the entire proceedings should be conducted through the national language.
('16', 374, 4, 23, 831888) Our people cannot have training in political affairs so long as this is not done.
('16', 374, 4, 24, 831970) Our Hindi newspapers are doing something in this respect but the education we want to be imparted to our people cannot be given through translations.
('16', 374, 4, 25, 832120) Similarly in our courts too the national and provincial languages must be used.
('16', 374, 4, 26, 832200) Under the existing set up people are being deprived of the education which they can easily receive from those who administer justice.
('16', 374, 4, 27, 832334) The Princes can promote the national language in a way in which the English Government cannot.
('16', 374, 4, 28, 832429) In the Holkar State, for example, in the Council and in the courts, Hindi and the provincial language alone can be used.
('16', 374, 4, 29, 832550) The encouragement they thus give to the national language will go a long way in helping it progress.
('16', 374, 4, 30, 832651) In the schools of this State the entire education from the beginning to the end should be imparted through the mother tongue.
('16', 374, 4, 31, 832777) In this way our
('16', 375, 0, 1, 832793) 376 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 375, 1, 2, 832835) Princes can render much service to the language.
('16', 375, 1, 3, 832884) I hope that Maharaja Holkar and his officials will take up this work enthusiastically.
('16', 375, 2, 4, 832971) It will be a sad delusion to think that we can achieve our objective merely through conferences.
('16', 375, 2, 5, 833068) Single minded devotion and constant application alone will bring success.
('16', 375, 2, 6, 833142) Only when hundreds of selfless scholars regard this work as their own can it be accomplished.
('16', 375, 2, 7, 833236) What I regret is that even the provinces which have Hindi for their mother tongue do not seem to show any enthusiasm for its promotion and propagation.
('16', 375, 2, 8, 833388) The educated classes in these provinces continue to use English for purposes of conversation and correspondence.
('16', 375, 2, 9, 833501) A friend has written to me that our newspaper proprietors do all their work in English; they keep their accounts, too, in English.
('16', 375, 2, 10, 833632) Englishmen living in France use their mother tongue in all their dealings.
('16', 375, 2, 11, 833707) Is it not a pity that we carry on even some of our most important activities in English?
('16', 375, 2, 12, 833796) It is my humble but firm opinion that unless we give Hindi its national status and the provincial languages their due place in life of the people, all the talk of swaraj is useless.
('16', 375, 2, 13, 833978) It is my fervent hope and prayer to God almighty that this Sammelan may be an instrument for the solution of this great question confronting India.

('16', 375, 5, 16, 834191) INDORE, March 30, 1918 2
('16', 375, 6, 17, 834216) We often think that changes of the kind that take place in Europe will also occur in India; that when some big transformation comes about, people who know beforehand how to prepare themselves for it win through and those who fail to take account of this are destroyed; that mere movement is progress and that our advancement lies in it.
('16', 375, 6, 18, 834553) We think that we shall be able to progress through the great discoveries that have been made in the continent of Europe.
('16', 375, 6, 19, 834674) But this is an illusion.
('16', 375, 6, 20, 834699) We are inhabitants of a country which has so long survived with its own civilization.
('16', 375, 6, 21, 834785) Many a civilization of Europe is destroyed,
('16', 375, 7, 22, 834829) 1 According to a report in The Bombay Chronicle, 2 4 1918, Gandhiji thanked Maharaja Holkar for his donation of Rs. 10,000 for propagation of Hindi.
('16', 375, 7, 23, 834978) 2 The date is according to the tour itinerary.
('16', 376, 0, 1, 835025) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 377
('16', 376, 1, 2, 835071) but India, our country, survives as a witness to its own civilization.
('16', 376, 1, 3, 835142) All scholars agree in testifying that the civilization of India is the same today as it was thousands of years ago.
('16', 376, 1, 4, 835258) But, now, there is reason to suspect that we no longer have faith in our civilization.
('16', 376, 1, 5, 835345) Every morning we do our worship and prayer, recite the verses composed by our forbears, but we do not understand their significance.
('16', 376, 1, 6, 835478) Our faith is turning in another direction.
('16', 376, 1, 7, 835521) So long as the world goes on, the war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas will also continue.
('16', 376, 1, 8, 835617) The books of almost all the religions say that the war between the gods and Satan goes on for ever.
('16', 376, 1, 9, 835717) The question is how we are to make our preparations.
('16', 376, 1, 10, 835770) I have come here to tell you that you should have faith in your civilization and keep to it steadfastly.
('16', 376, 1, 11, 835875) If you do this, India will one day hold sway over the entire world.
('16', 376, 1, 12, 835943) (Applause.)
('16', 376, 2, 13, 835955) Our leaders say that, in order to fight the West, we have to adopt the ways of the West.
('16', 376, 2, 14, 836044) But please rest assured that it will mean the end of Indian civilization.
('16', 376, 2, 15, 836118) India’s face is turned away from your modern trend; that India you do not know.
('16', 376, 2, 16, 836198) I have travelled much and so come to know the mind of India and I have discovered that it has preserved its faith in its ancient civilization.
('16', 376, 2, 17, 836341) The swaraj of which we hear will not be achieved the way we are working for it.
('16', 376, 2, 18, 836421) The Congress League Scheme, or any other scheme which is even better, will not get us swaraj.
('16', 376, 2, 19, 836515) We shall get swaraj through the way in which we live our lives.
('16', 376, 2, 20, 836579) It cannot be had for the asking.
('16', 376, 2, 21, 836612) We can never gain it through copying Europe.
('16', 376, 3, 22, 836657) That European civilization is Satanic we see for ourselves.
('16', 376, 3, 23, 836717) An obvious proof of this is the fierce war that is going on at present.
('16', 376, 3, 24, 836789) It is so terrible that the Mahabharata War was nothing in comparison.
('16', 376, 3, 25, 836859) This should be a warning to us and we should remember that our sages have given us the immutable and inviolate principles that our conduct should be godly and that it should be rooted in dharma.
('16', 376, 3, 26, 837054) We should follow these principles alone.
('16', 376, 3, 27, 837095) So long as we do not follow dharma, our wish will not be fulfilled, notwithstanding all the grandiose schemes we may devise.
('16', 376, 3, 28, 837220) Even if Mr. Montagu offers us swaraj today we can in no way benefit from that swaraj.
('16', 376, 3, 29, 837306) We must make use of the legacy left us by our rishis and munis.
('16', 376, 4, 30, 837370) The whole world knows that the tapasya that was practised in ancient India is found nowhere else.
('16', 376, 4, 31, 837468) Even if we want an empire for India, we can get it through no other method but that of self 
('16', 377, 0, 1, 837561) 378 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 377, 1, 2, 837603) discipline.
('16', 377, 1, 3, 837615) We can be certain that once the spirit of discipline comes to pervade our lives, we shall be able to get anything we may want.
('16', 377, 1, 4, 837742) Truth and non violence are our goal.
('16', 377, 1, 5, 837779) Non violence is the supreme dharma, there is no discovery of greater import than this.
('16', 377, 1, 6, 837866) So long as we engage in mundane actions, so long as soul and body are together, some violence will continue to occur through our agency.
('16', 377, 1, 7, 838003) But we must renounce at least the violence that it is possible for us to renounce.
('16', 377, 1, 8, 838086) We should understand that the less violence a religion permits, the more is the truth contained in it.
('16', 377, 1, 9, 838189) If we can ensure the deliverance of India, it is only through truth and non violence.
('16', 377, 1, 10, 838275) Lord Willingdon, the Governor of Bombay, has said that he feels greatly disappointed when he meets Indians for they do not express what is in their minds but only what would be agreeable to him, so that he never knows the real position.
('16', 377, 1, 11, 838512) Many people have this habit of hiding their own sentiments while in the presence of an important person and suiting their talk to his pleasure.
('16', 377, 1, 12, 838656) They do not realize how cruelly they deceive themselves and harm the truth.
('16', 377, 1, 13, 838732) One must say what one feels.
('16', 377, 1, 14, 838761) It is impertinence to go against one’s reason.
('16', 377, 1, 15, 838808) One must not hesitate the least to tell what one feels to anyone, be he a Minister of the Government or even a more exalted person.
('16', 377, 1, 16, 838940) Deal with all with truth and non violence.
('16', 377, 1, 17, 838983) Love is a rare herb that makes a friend even of a sworn enemy and this herb grows out of non violence.
('16', 377, 1, 18, 839086) What in a dormant state is non violence becomes love in the waking state.
('16', 377, 1, 19, 839160) Love destroys ill will.
('16', 377, 1, 20, 839184) We should love all—whether Englishmen or Muslims.
('16', 377, 1, 21, 839234) No doubt, we should protect the cow.
('16', 377, 1, 22, 839271) But we cannot do so by fighting with Muslims.
('16', 377, 1, 23, 839317) We cannot save the cow by killing Muslims..
('16', 377, 1, 24, 839361) We should act only through love; thus alone shall we succeed.
('16', 377, 1, 25, 839423) So long as we do not have unshakeable faith in truth, love and non violence, we can make no progress.
('16', 377, 1, 26, 839525) If we give up these and imitate European civilisation, we shall be doomed.
('16', 377, 1, 27, 839600) I pray to Suryanarayan 1 that India may not turn away from her civilization.
('16', 377, 1, 28, 839677) Be fearless.
('16', 377, 1, 29, 839690) So long as you live under various kinds of fears, you can never progress, you can never succeed.
('16', 377, 1, 30, 839787) Please do not forget our ancient civilization.
('16', 377, 1, 31, 839834) Never, never give up truth and love.
('16', 377, 1, 32, 839871) Treat all enemies and friends with love.
('16', 377, 1, 33, 839912) If you wish to make Hindi the national language, you can do so in a short time through the principles of truth and non violence.

('16', 378, 1, 2, 840149) 248. LETTER T0 THE PRESS
('16', 378, 2, 3, 840174) INDORE, March 31,1918 At the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, just closing, a committee consisting of the Hon’ble Rai Bahadur Bishen Dutta Shukla, Rai Bahadur Saryoo Prasad, Babu Shiva Prasad Gupta, Babu Purushottam Das Tandon, Babu Gauri Shanker Prasad, Pandit Venkatesha Narayan Tiwari and myself were appointed as a special committee to give effect to certain resolutions of the Sammelan.
('16', 378, 2, 4, 840557) One of the instructions given to the committee is to find out six Tamil and Telugu youths of promise and good character who would undertake to learn Hindi with a view to ultimately becoming missionaries for the propagation of Hindi among the Tamil and the Telugu people.
('16', 378, 2, 5, 840828) It has been proposed to locate them either at Allahabad or at Benares, and to teach them Hindi.
('16', 378, 2, 6, 840924) Expenses of their board and lodging as well as instruction will be paid for by the committee.
('16', 378, 2, 7, 841018) It is expected that the course will not take longer than a year at the most and, as soon as they have attained a certain standard of knowledge of Hindi, they would be entrusted with the missionary work, that is, the work of teaching Hindi to the Tamil or the Telugu people, as the case may be, for which they would get a salary to maintain themselves suitably.
('16', 378, 2, 8, 841379) The committee will guarantee such service for at least a period of three years, and will expect applicants to enter into a Contract with the committee to render the stipulated service faithfully and well for that period.
('16', 378, 2, 9, 841600) The committee expects that the services of these youths will be indefinitely prolonged and that they will be able to serve themselves as well as the country.
('16', 378, 2, 10, 841758) The desire of the committee is to offer liberal payment and expect in return absolute faithfulness and steadfastness.
('16', 378, 2, 11, 841876) I trust that you agree with the Sammelan that Hindi and Hindi alone, whether in Sanskrit form or as Urdu, can become the language of intercourse between the different provinces.
('16', 378, 2, 12, 842054) It is already that amongst the Mahomedans all over India, as also amongst the Hindus except in the Madras Presidency.
('16', 378, 2, 13, 842172) I exclude the English educated Indians who have made English, in my humble opinion, much to the detriment of the country, the language of mutual intercourse.
('16', 378, 2, 14, 842330) If we are to realize the swaraj ideal, we must find a common language that can be easily learnt and that can be understood by the vast masses.
('16', 378, 2, 15, 842473) This has always been Hindi or Urdu and is so even now, as I can say from personal experience.
('16', 378, 2, 16, 842567) I have faith enough in the patriotism, selflessness and the sagacity of the people of the Madras Presidency to know that those, who at all want to render national service or to come in touch with the other Provinces, will undergo the sacrifice, if it is one, of learning Hindi.
('16', 378, 2, 17, 842845) I suggest that they should consider it a privilege to be able to learn a language that
('16', 379, 0, 1, 842932) 380 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 379, 1, 2, 842974) will enable them to enter into the hearts of millions of their countrymen.
('16', 379, 1, 3, 843049) The proposal set forth is a temporary makeshift.
('16', 379, 1, 4, 843098) An agitation of great potency must arise in the country that would compel the educational authorities to introduce Hindi as the second language in the public schools.
('16', 379, 1, 5, 843265) But it was felt by the Sammelan that no time should be lost in popularizing Hindi in the Madras Presidency.
('16', 379, 1, 6, 843373) Hence the above mentioned proposal which, I hope, you will be able to commend to your readers.
('16', 379, 1, 7, 843468) I may add that the committee proposes to send Hindi teachers to the Tamil as also to the Andhra districts in order to teach Hindi free of charge to those who would care to learn it.
('16', 379, 1, 8, 843650) I hope that many will take advantage of the proffered tuition.
('16', 379, 1, 9, 843713) Those youths who wish to apply for the training above mentioned should do so under cover addressed to me care of Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Allahabad, before the end of April.

('16', 379, 4, 14, 844036) 2 The struggle is one against the attempt of the officials to crush the spirit of the people.
('16', 379, 4, 15, 844130) In the circumstances, I think it is our clear duty to assist the cultivators.
('16', 379, 4, 16, 844208) War cannot be allowed to cover oppression.
('16', 379, 4, 17, 844251) I understand that there will be a public meeting in Bombay to express sympathy for the people.
('16', 379, 4, 18, 844346) I hope that, if you at all can, you will attend the meeting and speak at it.

('16', 379, 6, 23, 844708) Need I say I am sensible of the honour it conveys ?
('16', 379, 6, 24, 844760) I have no desire to pit my judgment against that of people better qualified by experience and local knowledge.
('16', 379, 6, 25, 844871) But you would not like me to act except as my judgment approved, especially in important matters.
('16', 379, 6, 26, 844969) Frankly, I am not satisfied of the expediency of passive resistance in the Kaira affair, even allowing that the rights of the case were with the ryots.
('16', 379, 6, 27, 845121) I do not, however, approve of coercion by Govt.
('16', 379, 6, 28, 845169) In fact, I pressed the urgent call for a conciliatory policy as strongly as I could both on Sir Ibrahim Rahimtullah and Sir James Duboulay, when I saw them yesterday.
('16', 379, 6, 29, 845336) I am grieved to hesitate instead of springing to your side at your call.
('16', 379, 6, 30, 845409) But I know at the same time, you would not wish me in the circumstances to do what I cannot heartily approve.” For Gandhiji’s reply to this, Vide “Letter to V. S. Srinivasa Sastri’’, 5 4 1918.

('16', 380, 2, 3, 845676) NADIAD,
('16', 380, 3, 4, 845684) April 1, 1918
('16', 380, 4, 5, 845698) DEAR MR. STANLEY REED,
('16', 380, 5, 6, 845721) I am anxious to enlist your active sympathy in the Kaira trouble.
('16', 380, 5, 7, 845787) I have not embarked upon it without due consideration.
('16', 380, 5, 8, 845842) 1 The officials in class represent a spirit of intolerance which must spell ultimate ruin for us all.
('16', 380, 5, 9, 845944) It will be an object lesson for anybody to meet the Talatis in a body.
('16', 380, 5, 10, 846015) They represent the Viceroy to the people and they represent the rule of fear.
('16', 380, 5, 11, 846093) This rule must give way to regard for the people’s feelings.
('16', 380, 5, 12, 846154) They may succeed in collecting the revenue by coercion.
('16', 380, 5, 13, 846210) It will not be a victory.
('16', 380, 5, 14, 846236) It will be a clear defeat.
('16', 380, 5, 15, 846263) The price of collection will be deep resentment.
('16', 380, 5, 16, 846312) War cannot be allowed to cover acts of gross tyranny.
('16', 380, 5, 17, 846366) I hope you will find time to study the question and see your way to help the people.
('16', 380, 6, 18, 846451) Your sincerely,

('16', 381, 2, 3, 846731) April 1, 1918
('16', 381, 3, 4, 846745) The Government says it is determined to collect the revenue.
('16', 381, 3, 5, 846806) I say: “Recover it from our lands, seize our goods or take us into custody, but we do not wish to contradict ourselves by paying up the dues of our own accord.” In this fight, those who have justice on their side shall win.
('16', 381, 3, 6, 847030) As long as I am alive, I will fight for you.
('16', 381, 3, 7, 847075) There is no talk yet of confiscating lands; they have their eye only on jewellery, buffaloes or movable property.
('16', 381, 3, 8, 847189) There will be no great loss in this.
('16', 381, 3, 9, 847226) If the Government, for recovering ten rupees, takes away land worth a thousand rupees through confiscation, even God will not bear it.
('16', 381, 4, 10, 847361) You have married your husbands, not their jewellery or the cattle.
('16', 381, 4, 11, 847428) It is your dharma to help your husbands to observe their pledge.

('16', 381, 8, 15, 847562) [After April 1, 1918]
('16', 381, 9, 16, 847584) I got the news of the auction of your goods.
('16', 381, 9, 17, 847629) I can very well understand that you will not find it easy to bear your losses.
('16', 381, 9, 18, 847708) I feel, all the same, that this is the only way for us to rise.
('16', 381, 9, 19, 847772) I should like you to bear your grief over your losses patiently and cheerfully.
('16', 381, 9, 20, 847852) If the Government has inflicted the chothai, we shall fight it out and I am confident that we shall get the amounts back.
('16', 381, 9, 21, 847974) I congratulate you on the courage you have shown in letting your goods be auctioned.
('16', 381, 9, 22, 848059) I am sure your sacrifice will be duly rewarded.
('16', 381, 9, 23, 848107) I hope all friends will boldly adhere to their word.
('16', 381, 9, 24, 848160) May God give you divine strength and fortitude to fight this battle of truth to a successful end.

('16', 382, 2, 3, 848429) LIMBASI, April 2, 1918
('16', 382, 3, 4, 848452) DEAR MR. PRATT, I returned from Indore yesterday.
('16', 382, 3, 5, 848502) 1 am passing the day at Limbasi.
('16', 382, 3, 6, 848535) I observe that the whole of the crops of this Division has been placed under distraint.
('16', 382, 3, 7, 848623) This seems to me to be a cruel procedure.
('16', 382, 3, 8, 848665) Again complaints are being made that violence is being used against the people in other parts.
('16', 382, 3, 9, 848760) This, I know, can have no countenance from the higher officials.
('16', 382, 3, 10, 848825) The Government resist the people, and the latter the former on a matter of principle.
('16', 382, 3, 11, 848911) I think that the fight can be fought without bitterness.
('16', 382, 3, 12, 848968) Both will have gained in the end if none but the fairest means be adopted by the parties to gain their respective ends.
('16', 382, 4, 13, 849088) Yours sincerely,

('16', 382, 8, 17, 849196) LIMBASI, April 2, 1918
('16', 382, 9, 18, 849219) DEAR MR. GHOSAL, I arrived at Nadiad yesterday morning and have come here today.
('16', 382, 9, 19, 849300) I must say that the notice distraining the whole of the crops of the people is a cruel proceeding.
('16', 382, 9, 20, 849399) The villages are sending a petition seeking relief.
('16', 382, 9, 21, 849451) I am anxious that this should be and remain a fair fight between the Government and the people.
('16', 382, 9, 22, 849547) Then at the end of it both will have gained, for there will be no bitterness left behind.
('16', 382, 9, 23, 849637) I hear that in some cases even physical violence has been used.
('16', 382, 9, 24, 849701) This, I know, can only be unauthorized.
('16', 382, 9, 25, 849741) But it can be avoided if the officials at the lowest rung know and feel that the Government has no desire to be harsh.
('16', 382, 10, 26, 849860) Yours sincerely,
('16', 382, 11, 27, 849877) M. K. GANDHI My permanent address is Nadiad.

('16', 383, 1, 2, 850017) 255. SPEECH AT LIMBASI
('16', 383, 2, 3, 850040) April 2, 1918
('16', 383, 3, 4, 850054) We call the fight satyagraha.
('16', 383, 3, 5, 850084) We have made truth our weapon; hence, if you tell lies and deceive me, we shall go down and all over the country they will say that ours was a cowardly fight.
('16', 383, 3, 6, 850243) Let those who have not paid the full amount of the Government dues raise their hands; 1 and those who have paid the full amount raise theirs.
('16', 383, 3, 7, 850385) 2 This proves that most of the farmers have not paid the dues.
('16', 383, 3, 8, 850448) Indeed, this is a matter for joy.
('16', 383, 3, 9, 850482) If such a large number of people remain firm, victory is ours.
('16', 383, 3, 10, 850545) We should know what we mean by “victory”.
('16', 383, 3, 11, 850587) What are we fighting for?
('16', 383, 3, 12, 850613) We are fighting so that the Government may suspend the collection of revenue.
('16', 383, 3, 13, 850691) Where crops are less than four annas, the full amount of the assessment should be suspended and, where they have been between four and six annas, half the amount should be suspended; that is the law.
('16', 383, 3, 14, 850891) Many have had less than four annas yield, but some of them have paid up half the amount.
('16', 383, 3, 15, 850980) Our fight is to see that they don’t have to pay the remainder.
('16', 383, 3, 16, 851043) The Government says that, in most places, crops have been more than six annas; that being its view, we request the Government, in the interests o f justice, to appoint a committee of inquiry; this the Government refuses to do.
('16', 383, 3, 17, 851270) The question, here, is not merely one of land revenue.
('16', 383, 3, 18, 851325) I am pained to see that the Government should always insist that it is in the right and the people are in the wrong.
('16', 383, 3, 19, 851442) This bespeaks a state of slavery [for us].
('16', 383, 3, 20, 851485) We shall endure it no longer; of course, you won’t.
('16', 383, 3, 21, 851537) That is how you should feel.
('16', 383, 3, 22, 851566) We are fighting that you may taste the joy of freedom.
('16', 383, 3, 23, 851621) The people’s will is pitted against the Government’s.
('16', 383, 3, 24, 851675) Our stubbornness is in a right cause, hence we call it satyagraha.
('16', 383, 3, 25, 851742) If, in the fight, the Government attaches all our property and even then we do not pay the revenue, the victory will be ours.
('16', 383, 3, 26, 851868) Let the women give the same advice to their husbands.
('16', 383, 3, 27, 851922) If our crops have been less than what the Government says they are, we should stand firm in the truth we have stated.
('16', 383, 3, 28, 852040) If, out of fear of others, a man does what he ought not to, he will be ruined in his soul.
('16', 383, 3, 29, 852131) The true end of human effort, real manliness, consists in not acting thus.
('16', 383, 3, 30, 852206) We are not slaves; we are free.
('16', 383, 3, 31, 852238) The Government says that, if the people are allowed to raise their heads once, they will always hold them high.
('16', 383, 4, 32, 852350) 1 Some 200 hands were raised.
('16', 383, 4, 33, 852380) 2 Only three responded.
('16', 384, 0, 1, 852404) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 385
('16', 384, 1, 2, 852450) people have no time to go about unnecessarily raising their heads in defiance.
('16', 384, 1, 3, 852529) So much of their time is taken up in earning their bread.
('16', 384, 1, 4, 852587) We fight through voluntary suffering.
('16', 384, 1, 5, 852625) If any millionaire should offer to pay up the land revenue for you, you should flatly refuse the offer.
('16', 384, 1, 6, 852729) Such help brings us down.
('16', 384, 1, 7, 852755) People should fight with their own strength.
('16', 384, 1, 8, 852800) They should find their happiness in their suffering.
('16', 384, 1, 9, 852853) All the help I can give is to share in your suffering, give you my experience and advise you; more than this, I cannot do.
('16', 384, 1, 10, 852976) It is for you to fight.
('16', 384, 1, 11, 853000) If you don’t have peace or are not happy, we can share in all that you suffer.
('16', 384, 1, 12, 853079) If you are caught in a fire, how can we be happy ?
('16', 384, 1, 13, 853130) You may possibly be frightened by the notices and may shake with fear because the crops have been attached but, if you face the situation calmly and smilingly, the Government will find it impossible to act in this manner again.
('16', 384, 1, 14, 853358) The Government is doing all this to terrorize you.
('16', 384, 1, 15, 853409) Our Hindu scriptures speak of many examples of sacrifice for the sake of truth.
('16', 384, 1, 16, 853489) If the farmers of Limbasi allow themselves to be ruined for the sake of truth, we shall say that the story of Nalaraja was true, that we have today hundreds of Nalarajas in Limbasi.
('16', 384, 1, 17, 853671) Don’t mind if they have attached the barns.
('16', 384, 1, 18, 853715) Let them confiscate the lands.
('16', 384, 1, 19, 853746) It will be a golden day for us when, deprived of our lands, we issue forth from our villages with drums joyfully beating before us, for then it will be proved that you had fulfilled your pledge.
('16', 384, 1, 20, 853941) We shall not permit those who lose their all to starve.
('16', 384, 1, 21, 853997) If you have to go without food, I and hundreds like me will starve with you.
('16', 384, 1, 22, 854074) If you submit to suffering, happiness will come seeking you.
('16', 384, 1, 23, 854135) This is a law of nature.
('16', 384, 1, 24, 854160) When people have to submit to oppression by the Talati, the village chiefs and ravanias 1, what else can we expect from the mamlatdar?
('16', 384, 1, 25, 854295) And the Collector: how dare one set one’s eyes on him?
('16', 384, 1, 26, 854350) This is a mistaken notion under which you are labouring.
('16', 384, 1, 27, 854407) There is no law requiring you to live in fear of the officers.
('16', 384, 1, 28, 854470) If we are not afraid, the law cannot punish us either.
('16', 384, 1, 29, 854525) We should fear only God.
('16', 384, 1, 30, 854550) Those who become the victims of oppression need not get frightened.
('16', 384, 1, 31, 854618) This is the first time we are fighting the Government.
('16', 384, 1, 32, 854673) Ours is a fight for truth.
('16', 384, 1, 33, 854700) Indulal 2 and Hariprasad will remain in this taluka.
('16', 384, 1, 34, 854753) You may keep them informed of what you have to suffer.
('16', 384, 1, 35, 854808) In other talukas, too, we shall make similar arrangements.
('16', 384, 1, 36, 854867) We shall issue

('16', 385, 1, 7, 855444) When the farmers declare that they are men and have courage enough, that they are prepared for sacrifices for the sake of truth, I shall say they are not men, but gods.

('16', 385, 3, 11, 855700) NADIAD, April 4, 1918
('16', 385, 4, 12, 855722) DEAR SIR JAMES DUBOULAY, Although the Kaira matter is not under your Department, I feel that as you are a member of the Executive Council and as perhaps of all the members you know me best, I would not hesitate to place the position before you.
('16', 385, 4, 13, 855967) The situation is not of my seeking nor is it the work of the Home Rule party in any shape or form.
('16', 385, 4, 14, 856066) The initiative entirely belongs to the Kaira people.
('16', 385, 4, 15, 856119) Even at the present moment I am endeavouring as much as possible to keep it outside the political view.
('16', 385, 4, 16, 856223) The people have tried every means at their disposal of serving what they believe to be justice and they have failed.
('16', 385, 4, 17, 856340) What was I to advise?
('16', 385, 4, 18, 856362) Were they quietly to sell their treasured belongings or incur debts to pay the Government dues and be noted liars in the bragain?
('16', 385, 4, 19, 856492) For be it remembered that the local officials think that their figures are absolutely right and the people’s wrong.
('16', 385, 4, 20, 856608) The people naturally look up to public workers for advice.
('16', 385, 4, 21, 856667) For me to have advised them to suffer the wrong would have been to increase their weakness and send their discontent underground.
('16', 385, 4, 22, 856797) What I have done enables the people to state their case boldly and if they are in the wrong or the Government unbending to suffer their property to be sold.
('16', 385, 4, 23, 856954) This is at best a striking and orderly demonstration of their grief and of their faith in the ultimate triumph
('16', 385, 5, 24, 857065) 1 The meeting was later postponed, vide the following item.
('16', 386, 0, 1, 857125) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 387
('16', 386, 1, 2, 857171) of truth and in the desire of the Government to do justice.
('16', 386, 1, 3, 857231) I cannot help saying that the doctrine of infallibility of the officials is alike dangerous and intolerable.
('16', 386, 1, 4, 857340) I can see nothing wrong in the Government adopting the principle of arbitration as between themselves and the ryots.
('16', 386, 1, 5, 857457) They can only gain in prestige.
('16', 386, 1, 6, 857489) The Talati and Mukhi rule which is the rule of fear must give place to the rule of law.
('16', 386, 1, 7, 857577) Anyway that is what I am striving for throughout India.
('16', 386, 1, 8, 857633) Will you not assist?
('16', 386, 1, 9, 857654) For the facts of the case I enclose herewith my letter to the Press 1. If you wish to see me I am at your service.

('16', 386, 4, 12, 857846) April 4, 1918
('16', 386, 5, 13, 857860) When we met in Nadiad a few days ago and resolved on satyagraha, I said that I would have to go to Delhi for the sake of Mahomed Ali and Shaukat Ali.
('16', 386, 5, 14, 858010) It may seem that I take but a casual interest in this issue but I alone know how much, in fact, I am occupied with it.
('16', 386, 5, 15, 858129) Of the guests present here, Shri Shuaib 2 is among the same class of persons as the two brothers.
('16', 386, 5, 16, 858227) I said at the meeting of the Muslim League that, wherever I move in India, I embrace with love all Muslims who have their minds fixed on Allah and who recognize the truth.
('16', 386, 5, 17, 858399) My friends Mahomed Ali and Shaukat Ali are in this class.
('16', 386, 5, 18, 858457) It was in the course of my efforts to get to know these brothers 3 that I encountered Shri Shuaib.
('16', 386, 5, 19, 858556) He has come here at my instance.
('16', 386, 5, 20, 858589) He is a man of learning and a friend of truth.
('16', 386, 5, 21, 858636) He has spared himself no sacrifice.
('16', 386, 5, 22, 858672) In what terms shall I introduce to you the other friends ?
('16', 386, 5, 23, 858731) My own brothers are dead; but we have here Shri Rajendra Babu 4, on seeing whom I forget their loss.
('16', 386, 5, 24, 858832) He has given me love such as I can never forget.
('16', 386, 5, 25, 858881) Shri Badrinath Verma also belongs to Bihar, the land of King Janak.
('16', 386, 5, 26, 858949) Sister Anandibai has made up for my want of a daughter.
('16', 386, 5, 27, 859005) She is a widow.
('16', 386, 5, 28, 859021) She is still studying.
('16', 386, 5, 29, 859044) In Champaran, when I felt the

('16', 387, 1, 3, 859420) Let us plan our satyagraha in the presence of these witnesses.
('16', 387, 1, 4, 859483) Bombay is the abode of the rich.
('16', 387, 1, 5, 859516) It is difficult to explain to them the meaning of satyagraha, and more difficult still to explain it to the Bombay Government, for it always confronts us with some legal point or other.
('16', 387, 1, 6, 859702) However, as a result of the recent deliberations, a committee has been appointed.
('16', 387, 1, 7, 859784) They will wait on the Government.
('16', 387, 1, 8, 859818) The idea of a public meeting in Bombay has been put off for some time.
('16', 387, 1, 9, 859889) I don’t like to leave you and go to Bombay.
('16', 387, 1, 10, 859933) I can bring myself to go nowhere, leaving you.
('16', 387, 1, 11, 859980) It is not with Bombay’s help that we want to win this fight.
('16', 387, 1, 12, 860041) If the farmers of Kheda should drop off one by one, out of fear of Government, how will help from Bombay avail ?
('16', 387, 1, 13, 860154) Tell them the confidently that yours is a struggle in a just cause and that you are prepared for any sacrifice for it.
('16', 387, 1, 14, 860273) It was indeed good that I brought with me these guests.
('16', 387, 1, 15, 860329) This is Vallabhbhai’s native place.
('16', 387, 1, 16, 860365) Vallabhbhai is still in the fire and will have to endure a good deal of heat, but I think out of this all we shall have gold in the end.
('16', 387, 1, 17, 860502) Let your good wishes go with him.
('16', 387, 1, 18, 860536) It was good of you to have treated him to a dinner of ladus 1 but, to crown it all, you need to offer dakshina 2; this can only be that you do not pay the Government a single pie; let it, if it will, drown you in that lake or throw you into fire.
('16', 387, 1, 19, 860783) It is a very good thing that this meeting is being attended by agriculturists from the Baroda State.
('16', 387, 1, 20, 860884) If we lose our lands in satyagraha, I hope they will offer theirs to us.
('16', 387, 1, 21, 860957) If we say that the crops have been less than four annas, how can we bear that the Government should exact from us a single pie?
('16', 387, 1, 22, 861085) There is also another issue in this struggle, and that is whether the Government’s view should prevail or the people’s.
('16', 387, 1, 23, 861205) The subjects’ loyalty to their Government consists in resisting the obduracy of officers.
('16', 387, 1, 24, 861295) We have to be men.
('16', 387, 1, 25, 861314) Now that we have woken up, we must take thought what we do.
('16', 387, 1, 26, 861374) Great changes are taking place in the country.
('16', 387, 1, 27, 861421) Abroad, terrible bloodshed is going on.
('16', 387, 1, 28, 861461) In the war in Europe, the British have proved themselves a brave people.
('16', 387, 1, 29, 861534) We want to be partners of these heroes.
('16', 387, 1, 30, 861574) We shall command respect as such only if, in company with them, we make ourselves a heroic people.
('16', 387, 1, 31, 861673) If we do not, we shall affect them as well with unmanliness.
('16', 387, 1, 32, 861734) If we become abject, we shall make them so.

('16', 388, 1, 3, 861969) In a fight, one does not become brave by taking up arms.
('16', 388, 1, 4, 862026) Arms may be there, but they will be useless to those who are cowards in their hearts.
('16', 388, 1, 5, 862112) Heroism fearlessness lies in a man bearing sword cuts without shrinking.
('16', 388, 1, 6, 862185) This kind of heroism is possible to all men, women and children.
('16', 388, 1, 7, 862250) I want the agriculturists of Kheda to have it.
('16', 388, 1, 8, 862297) Our weapon is an uncompromising insistence on truth.
('16', 388, 1, 9, 862350) Let the agriculturists of Kheda sacrifice their all rather than pay the land revenue.
('16', 388, 1, 10, 862436) I am confident the agriculturists here, at Karamsad, will never turn their backs.
('16', 388, 1, 11, 862518) We are to submit to suffering, to sacrifice our possessions.
('16', 388, 1, 12, 862579) To be sure, we may feel concerned what we shall have for food.
('16', 388, 1, 13, 862642) He who has given us teethwill provide the food.
('16', 388, 2, 14, 862690) We are to sacrifice our all in this struggle.
('16', 388, 2, 15, 862736) All the same, those who, with motives none too clean, lay their hands on our lands will not be happy with them.
('16', 388, 2, 16, 862848) If the Government does so, we shall turn ourselves outlaws in defiance.
('16', 388, 2, 17, 862920) If, to recover revenue of a hundred rupees, they seize land worth ten thousand, the man who bids for it will not profit from it.
('16', 388, 2, 18, 863049) This Government is not based on robbery, but justice.
('16', 388, 2, 19, 863103) The day I learn that it is deliberately run for plunder, be sure I shall turn disloyal to it.
('16', 388, 2, 20, 863197) Why have this fear, what you would do if deprived of your lands?
('16', 388, 2, 21, 863262) Nobody will ever find it profitable to appropriate our lands.

('16', 388, 4, 24, 863385) [Before April 5, 1918]
('16', 388, 5, 25, 863408) DEAR MR. NATARAJAN 2, It grieves me to find that sometimes you jump to hurried conclusions and will not have the patience to hear the other side.
('16', 388, 5, 26, 863554) This, I venture to think, adversely affects your capacity for national service which I know you always want to render.
('16', 388, 5, 27, 863673) Take this Kaira affair.
('16', 388, 5, 28, 863697) I do not mind your differing from me.
('16', 388, 5, 29, 863735) On the contrary, I honour you for your stating your convictions even though it may hurt you to have to
('16', 388, 6, 30, 863838) 1 At this point, questions were put to Gandhiji.
('16', 388, 6, 31, 863887) What follows is his reply to one of them.
('16', 388, 6, 32, 863929) 2 Kamakshi Natarajan, editor of Indian Social Reformer
('16', 389, 0, 1, 863984) 390 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 389, 1, 2, 864026) hold them in opposition to your friends.
('16', 389, 1, 3, 864067) My complaint however is against the haste with which you form your conclusions.
('16', 389, 1, 4, 864147) You do not know the inwardness of the Kaira struggle and you have no time to study it.
('16', 389, 1, 5, 864234) There was the Godhra Conference 1 in which the masses for the first time took an active part.
('16', 389, 1, 6, 864328) Some of these men, at the end of the Conference, twitted the leaders with these remarks: “What is the use of your holding Conferences and inviting us?
('16', 389, 1, 7, 864479) Kaira is face to face with practically a failure of crops.
('16', 389, 1, 8, 864538) The raiyats are entitled to suspension.
('16', 389, 1, 9, 864578) What are you people doing in the matter?” Some of the listeners accepted the rebuke as well deserved and undertook to move in the matter.
('16', 389, 1, 10, 864716) Hence the petition 2 signed by thousands for suspension.
('16', 389, 1, 11, 864773) This petition alone should have been sufficient to warrant suspension which would have meant merely loss of interest to the Government, but the gaining of goodwill in return.
('16', 389, 1, 12, 864948) The officials, however, took a dubious and a devious course.
('16', 389, 1, 13, 865009) They set about getting annawari patraks 3 of which I can say that most of them will not bear a close scrutiny.
('16', 389, 1, 14, 865120) The raiyats have exhausted every means at their disposal for getting relief.
('16', 389, 1, 15, 865197) Each time these faulty documents are flung in their faces.
('16', 389, 1, 16, 865256) What are they to do ?
('16', 389, 1, 17, 865278) To sell their cattle, trees or other belongings and to quietly pay the revenue?
('16', 389, 1, 18, 865358) I would defy you to be on the scene as I have been and to advise the raiyats to do so.
('16', 389, 1, 19, 865445) You must know the methods that are employed in order to exact payment from raiyats when they have no crops.
('16', 389, 1, 20, 865553) I could not calmly contemplate an emasculation of the raiyats taking place in front of me.
('16', 389, 1, 21, 865644) Nor could you.
('16', 389, 1, 22, 865659) I hold that it is a perfectly constitutional, just and righteous thing for a people to say, “Since you reject our petitions and if we have to pay, we can only pay by borrowing or selling our belongings.” You have only to come and see with what perfectly good humour the fight is being carried on, how the people are steeling their hearts for any kind of loss and how elderly men and women, too, are taking part in the demonstration.
('16', 389, 1, 23, 866092) You at least ought to see that this self inflicted suffering must exalt the nation, whereas the same suffering unwillingly undergone hitherto has only degraded the nation.
('16', 389, 1, 24, 866264) This is a bread agitation.
('16', 389, 1, 25, 866291) What is the use of a thousand meetings in India, praying for redress if they are to tell the people calmly to denude

('16', 390, 1, 3, 866867) It is like giving them stone when they asked for bread.
('16', 390, 1, 4, 866923) I wish this letter would prick your conscience, stimulate your inquiring spirit, bring you to Kaira and see the campaign in working.
('16', 390, 1, 5, 867056) I would then not only be prepared to submit to, but would invite, your report no matter how adverse it may be to the cause.
('16', 390, 1, 6, 867180) I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that you have at least studied the question.
('16', 390, 1, 7, 867266) You owe this to yourself, to a friend, and to the nation.
('16', 390, 1, 8, 867324) If you cannot give this much time to the cause, you must have no business to hold any opinion on the Kaira affair.
('16', 390, 1, 9, 867439) I hope you will pardon me for my presumption in writing to you as I have done.
('16', 390, 1, 10, 867518) As I have told you so often, I always endeavour to secure your co operation and help in my work and I should be satisfied not to have it if you withhold it after full consideration.
('16', 390, 1, 11, 867700) You ought not to be led astray by the term “passive resistance”.
('16', 390, 1, 12, 867765) You have got a concrete case.
('16', 390, 1, 13, 867795) Judge it on its merits.

('16', 391, 3, 4, 869015) DEAR MR. GHOSAL, I have just heard that Agarpura, Od and Nasar cattle have been distrained and in one case a milch buffalo actually removed.
('16', 391, 3, 5, 869156) The owner writes bitterly complaining that although he pointed out other goods, the distraint upon his animal was insisted on.
('16', 391, 3, 6, 869283) In some cases officials, so the people say, have entered their cottages including kitchens without putting off shoes.
('16', 391, 3, 7, 869401) If you would rob your process of distraint of all tyranny, it is absolutely necessary to stop distraint of cattle, to recall all chothai orders and forfeiture notices and to respect popular prejudices when entering their homes.

('16', 391, 5, 9, 869682) 261. SPEECH AT VADATHAL
('16', 391, 6, 10, 869706) April 5, 1918
('16', 391, 7, 11, 869720) From the very beginning, the village of Vadathal has taken a leading part in this struggle.
('16', 391, 7, 12, 869812) I have moved from farm to farm here and assured myself that on the average the crop in this village is less than four annas.
('16', 391, 7, 13, 869937) The Collector came over for a fresh inquiry.
('16', 391, 7, 14, 869982) I wrote to him that I had ascertained the facts myself and found that the crop was less than four annas, but he did not agree with me.
('16', 391, 7, 15, 870117) I have told him that ours is a struggle through self suffering.
('16', 391, 7, 16, 870181) I have seen people suffer in satyagraha much more than you do.
('16', 391, 7, 17, 870244) I shall have you swallow bitter draughts.
('16', 391, 7, 18, 870286) You should celebrate the days on which they sell your buffaloes here, auction away your things and confiscate your belongings.
('16', 391, 7, 19, 870413) If anyone in Vadathal is jailed, the prison will have been sanctified.
('16', 391, 7, 20, 870484) Especially the women should have a feast when their husbands go to jail.
('16', 391, 7, 21, 870557) Notices of confiscation have been issued, by way of threats; in spite of them, we remain the owners of our lands.
('16', 391, 7, 22, 870671) Whatever the value of these lands, we should not falter ever so little in our duty.
('16', 391, 7, 23, 870755) In case you should lose your all in this struggle, not one of you will be allowed to starve.
('16', 391, 7, 24, 870848) We shall go and beg but provide for you.
('16', 391, 7, 25, 870889) Bear your sufferings for the sake of your pledge.
('16', 392, 0, 1, 870939) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 393
('16', 392, 1, 2, 870985) If I pay you money for the buffaloes, I and all of you will have deceived the people.
('16', 392, 1, 3, 871071) It will be wrong if we help you financially so that you may join the satyagraha.
('16', 392, 1, 4, 871152) We can stand by you, keep up your courage and give you our moral support when the Government takes repressive measures against you.
('16', 392, 1, 5, 871284) I want to rid you of the unmanliness that has come to possess you.
('16', 392, 1, 6, 871351) I want to bring back the olden days in India.
('16', 392, 2, 7, 871397) If in ancient times we had a Sita, this age, too, I believe, should produce one.
('16', 392, 2, 8, 871478) If at one time we had a Ramachandra, such a one as flowers but once in an age, the modern age, too, should produce another like him in this country.
('16', 392, 2, 9, 871627) This should be a part of our heritage.
('16', 392, 2, 10, 871666) You know the stories of Harishchandra and Dhruva.
('16', 392, 2, 11, 871716) We may not be able to do all that Harishchandra did, but something of him is bound to have come down to us.
('16', 392, 2, 12, 871824) Let the women here, too, understand the utmost importance of a pledge.
('16', 392, 2, 13, 871895) If they are not firm enough to hold to a pledge once taken, their children, too, will grow up to have no spirit in them.
('16', 392, 2, 14, 872016) The God who has created us will have justice done to us.
('16', 392, 2, 15, 872073) If, moreover, we stand firm in this struggle, we shall by and by be able to secure the reins of Government as well in our hands.
('16', 392, 2, 16, 872202) If I should have to die for saving the agriculturists of Vadathal, I would be only too happy to do so.
('16', 392, 2, 17, 872305) I am not unaware that at present your buffaloes are being sold against land revenue dues.
('16', 392, 2, 18, 872395) There have been many other cases in which people have paid land revenue by selling off their buffaloes.
('16', 392, 2, 19, 872499) That you may not have to endure such misery year after year, you may let the Government sell the buffaloes for this once.
('16', 392, 2, 20, 872621) It is welcome to do so, this year.
('16', 392, 2, 21, 872656) Next year, rest assured, it will not find it possible to sell your buffaloes or subject you to any other hardships.
('16', 392, 2, 22, 872772) Even the birds and beasts have a sense of self respect and you are human beings.
('16', 392, 2, 23, 872853) See, therefore, that you do not fail in your pledge.
('16', 392, 2, 24, 872906) Things were explained to you so very clearly before you took it.
('16', 392, 2, 25, 872971) Though we have the help of the rich in this struggle, to fight with their help is much like a man looking stout because of swellings on his person.
('16', 392, 2, 26, 873119) Have faith in God; if we tread the path of right and justice, God will protect us.
('16', 392, 2, 27, 873202) Be it justice or money, we can have it from none but Him.
('16', 392, 2, 28, 873260) Consider, now, the condition of those who are working among you.
('16', 392, 2, 29, 873325) There is not a single moment in the twenty four hours when I am not thinking of the satyagraha in Kheda.

('16', 393, 1, 3, 873511) There was no dearth of public work for him in Ahmedabad.
('16', 393, 1, 4, 873568) He has left aside all these things and has come here to take up the work and live in your midst.
('16', 393, 1, 5, 873665) As you see, Shri Vallabhbhai and Shri Keshavprasad have just arrived from Mahudha.
('16', 393, 1, 6, 873748) Two friends have come all the way from Champaran.
('16', 393, 1, 7, 873798) They have come from the land of King Janak, eager to see you.

('16', 393, 6, 15, 874159) 1 He must have written to you all about it.
('16', 393, 6, 16, 874203) You had better have some patience.
('16', 393, 6, 17, 874238) He promises that he will certainly release you.
('16', 393, 6, 18, 874286) This should suffice.
('16', 393, 6, 19, 874307) He says it will do harm if the thing is made public right now.
('16', 393, 6, 20, 874370) And yes, there is one thing more.
('16', 393, 6, 21, 874404) We do hope you will get well, and, if you do, it is everyone’s wish that you should raise no objections to marrying.
('16', 393, 6, 22, 874521) I am the first to wish this.
('16', 393, 6, 23, 874550) I merely want to make this clear about you, that, if you refuse to marry, .
('16', 393, 6, 24, 874626) 2 it will be for reasons of health, that there will be no other reason.

('16', 393, 6, 30, 874876) I should like you to agree to this cheerfully out of regard for your well wishers, but not at the risk of your health.

('16', 394, 2, 3, 875253) NADIAD, April 6, 1918
('16', 394, 3, 4, 875275) DEAR MR. PRATT, Your letter of the 29th ultimo has been redirected to me from Indore.
('16', 394, 3, 5, 875361) I thank you for it.
('16', 394, 3, 6, 875381) Evidently it was His Excellency’s desire that notwithstanding the final letter I should have sought an interview with you.
('16', 394, 3, 7, 875504) Do you think that we may usefully meet and discuss the situation?
('16', 394, 3, 8, 875570) I had a full chat with Mr. Ghosal and Mr. Hood yesterday.
('16', 394, 3, 9, 875628) We were able to reach a reasonable solution regarding Limbasi.
('16', 394, 3, 10, 875691) But I am anxious that an equally reasonable solution may be reached on the general question.
('16', 394, 3, 11, 875784) Your charge about my taking on too many responsibilities is only too true.
('16', 394, 3, 12, 875859) I can but plead helplessness.
('16', 394, 3, 13, 875889) I know that I should be there and handle the mill hands insetad of leaving them to Miss Anasuya Sarabhai 1. And yet I dare not leave the Kaira matter.
('16', 394, 3, 14, 876040) I could not avoid it in the first instance.
('16', 394, 3, 15, 876084) I shall look forward to your visit to the school.
('16', 394, 3, 16, 876134) I am anxious to interest you in my experiment.
('16', 394, 3, 17, 876181) Do please apologize on my behalf to Miss Green for my having run away from Ahmedabad.
('16', 394, 3, 18, 876267) I have your second letter also for which many thanks.
('16', 394, 4, 19, 876321) Yours sincerely,

('16', 394, 8, 23, 876425) April 6, 1918 One had far better lay down one’s life for the sake of truth; but, out of fear of economic loss, to submit to oppression like the animals—there is nothing so despicable as this.
('16', 394, 8, 24, 876617) Let the women do their duty, standing beside their husbands in this fight for truth and holding them firmly to their course.

('16', 395, 2, 3, 876988) April 6, 1918
('16', 395, 3, 4, 877002) It was my hope that women also would be present at this meeting.
('16', 395, 3, 5, 877067) In this work there is as much need of women as of men.
('16', 395, 3, 6, 877122) If women join our struggle and share our sufferings, we can do fine work.
('16', 395, 3, 7, 877196) I see that people’s enthusiasm is mounting.
('16', 395, 3, 8, 877240) This is a people’s fight and, once the people have come to understand things, the Government may fight on as long as it chooses, we shall not be defeated.
('16', 395, 3, 9, 877395) Now at last the time has come when we can see if people have courage.
('16', 395, 3, 10, 877465) Our goods are being attached and buffaloes taken away; hardships such as these purify us as fire purifies gold.
('16', 395, 3, 11, 877577) In this struggle, you are being taught courage, firmness and patience.
('16', 395, 3, 12, 877648) The Government has resorted to every possible repressive measure in this town.
('16', 395, 3, 13, 877727) But we want to show to the world that we have some mettle in us, have the strength to suffer and that, in fulfilling our pledge, we shall spare ourselves nothing.
('16', 395, 3, 14, 877890) Uttarsanda is all Patidars and, if this fight is to be won, it is only your community that will do so.
('16', 395, 3, 15, 877993) They have seen good days as well as bad.
('16', 395, 3, 16, 878034) I should like to see you go bravely through this struggle.
('16', 395, 3, 17, 878093) It bespeaks your sense of honour that you have joined this struggle.
('16', 395, 3, 18, 878162) Some may advise you to try your strength with weapons, but remember that he who can wield a stick can also ward off a blow with one.
('16', 395, 3, 19, 878295) I want you to use your strength well and in a right cause.
('16', 395, 3, 20, 878354) It is very much to be desired that a ‘satyagrahi army’ is formed, ever ready to fight for the honour of India.
('16', 395, 3, 21, 878465) The nation is entitled to expect much from your town, inhabited by so many strong and brave men.
('16', 395, 3, 22, 878562) I am having these days a wonderful experience of the amazing strength the people of Kheda District possess.
('16', 395, 3, 23, 878670) If all friends abide by the sacred pledge they have taken in this struggle, there is not the least doubt that we should have swaraj in twenty four hours.
('16', 395, 3, 24, 878824) And so I have but one request to make to you all.
('16', 395, 3, 25, 878874) Let the Government auction your household utensils, your bedsteads, your cattle; but don’t be shaken in your purpose, ever.
('16', 395, 3, 26, 878998) I want this promise from you.
('16', 395, 3, 27, 879028) I crave this gift.
('16', 395, 3, 28, 879047) You will please me if you give it.
('16', 395, 4, 29, 879082) 1 Gandhiji visited Uttarsanda, accompanied by Kasturba Gandhi, Vallabhbhai Patel, Mahadev Desai, Shankarlal Banker and Anasuyabehn.

('16', 396, 1, 3, 879397) I have drawn you into satyagraha because I have recognized your strength.

('16', 396, 4, 7, 879591) April 7, 1918
('16', 396, 5, 8, 879605) We are coming here straight from Torana.
('16', 396, 5, 9, 879646) The agriculturists there are holding out quite as well as those in Navagam and elsewhere in Dasakosi [taluka].
('16', 396, 5, 10, 879757) I am sure that despite the heavy assault on it, Torana will not fall.
('16', 396, 5, 11, 879827) Keep up this struggle which is based on truth.
('16', 396, 5, 12, 879874) See that the women go with you in all that you do.
('16', 396, 5, 13, 879925) Their courage and fortitude will serve us well.
('16', 396, 5, 14, 879973) If we have to yield, because they are afraid of losing their buffaloes, we shall have no place to stand on.
('16', 396, 5, 15, 880081) If they give us courage, we shall win.
('16', 396, 5, 16, 880120) The first step towards swaraj is to abide by the sacred pledge we have taken.
('16', 396, 5, 17, 880198) Swaraj consists in the very fact of having acquired such strength.
('16', 396, 5, 18, 880265) It is our duty to know and to safeguard our rights.
('16', 396, 5, 19, 880317) This is a struggle to compel the Government to respect popular feeling and acknowledge our rights.
('16', 396, 6, 20, 880416) We should not cross the bounds of common decency in this struggle.
('16', 396, 6, 21, 880483) Complaints have been received about some of us having harassed the officers.
('16', 396, 6, 22, 880560) Untruth, discourtesy and arrogant harassment of others are unbecoming of us.
('16', 396, 6, 23, 880637) They betray lack of discipline.
('16', 396, 6, 24, 880669) Through this struggle, we have to learn to behave with respect and courtesy towards others.
('16', 396, 6, 25, 880761) Satyagraha must display the qualities of truthfulness and courtesy.
('16', 396, 7, 26, 880829) Truthfulness, courage and zeal are indispensable in this fight.
('16', 396, 7, 27, 880893) Again, one cannot hold out unless one puts all one’s heart into it.
('16', 396, 7, 28, 880961) These qualities will not spill over if we cover them with the lid of courtesy.
('16', 396, 7, 29, 881040) Our pledge is not for a few months only, but for an indefinite period.
('16', 396, 7, 30, 881111) So long as the Government does not accede to our request, we shall not retreat a single inch but lose all that we have.

('16', 396, 8, 33, 881323) Over 3,000 agriculturists had gathered to listen to him.

('16', 397, 1, 2, 881422) have immovable faith, not in me or anyone else, but in yourselves.
('16', 397, 1, 3, 881489) This is not a struggle merely to secure suspension of land revenue, but to see that the pledge behind it is honoured.
('16', 397, 1, 4, 881607) We are to show through this fight who will have the last word, the Government or we.
('16', 397, 1, 5, 881692) So long as the Government has not the support of the people, it will not find it possible to hold out.
('16', 397, 1, 6, 881795) The satisfaction you would derive from having honoured your pledge, you will not get from your lands.
('16', 397, 1, 7, 881897) Minstrels and bards will sing of your prowess and their songs will inspire your children too to heroism.
('16', 397, 1, 8, 882002) You will pass on to them, as a priceless legacy, the temper which regards a pledge as a sacred obligation.
('16', 397, 1, 9, 882109) Fight like brave ones to honour the pledge you have taken.
('16', 397, 1, 10, 882168) The key to swaraj for India lies in this.
('16', 397, 1, 11, 882210) To suffer for the sake of truth and win immortal fame, that is your truest duty today; in that lies your honour and that of India.

('16', 397, 5, 15, 882404) ON THE TRAIN, April 8, 1918
('16', 397, 6, 16, 882432) DEAR ESTHER, I seem to have been cruelly neglectful in my correspondence with you.
('16', 397, 6, 17, 882515) I could not be satisfied with giving only a line to you.
('16', 397, 6, 18, 882572) I wanted to give you a long love letter.
('16', 397, 6, 19, 882613) I have not the quiet for framing such a letter.
('16', 397, 6, 20, 882661) And I dare not wait any longer.
('16', 397, 6, 21, 882693) I do not know how I can describe my activities not one of which is of my own seeking.
('16', 397, 6, 22, 882779) They have all come to me with a persistence I dare not oppose.
('16', 397, 6, 23, 882842) What is a soldier to do if he is hemmed in on all sides ?
('16', 397, 6, 24, 882900) Is he to concentrate his effort on dealing with one attack only and to court extinction by ignoring the other attacks that are being simultaneously delivered?
('16', 397, 6, 25, 883059) Obviously safety lies in dealing with all in the best way he can.
('16', 397, 6, 26, 883125) Such is almost my position.
('16', 397, 6, 27, 883153) Distress pleads before me from all sides.
('16', 397, 6, 28, 883195) I dare not refuse help where I know the remedy.
('16', 397, 6, 29, 883243) The Ahmedabad strike provided the richest lessons of life.
('16', 397, 6, 30, 883302) The power of love was never so effectively demonstrated to me as it was during the lock out.

('16', 398, 1, 3, 883538) Your telegram was the most touching and the truest of all.
('16', 398, 1, 4, 883597) Those four days were to me days of peace, blessing and spiritual uplifting.
('16', 398, 1, 5, 883673) There never was the slightest desire to eat during those days.
('16', 398, 1, 6, 883736) The Kaira affair you must have understood from my letter to the Press.
('16', 398, 1, 7, 883807) 1 I wrote one on the fast too.
('16', 398, 1, 8, 883838) 2 If you have not seen the letters, please let me know.
('16', 398, 1, 9, 883894) I hope you are keeping well.
('16', 398, 1, 10, 883923) In liver complaints nothing answers so well as fasting.
('16', 398, 1, 11, 883979) Please address your letters to Ahmedabad or rather Sabarmati.

('16', 398, 8, 18, 884178) Anandibehn gave me news of you.
('16', 398, 8, 19, 884210) You have been separated from Mahadev longer than I thought.
('16', 398, 8, 20, 884270) I have told him that he can go there whenever he likes; but if you so wish, I am prepared to send him at once.
('16', 398, 8, 21, 884381) I should tell you, all the same; that Mahadev has been passing through experiences which will mean so much to him.
('16', 398, 8, 22, 884496) You will also share in his gain.
('16', 398, 8, 23, 884529) If you can take comfort in this thought and get over your sadness at separation, he may stay on.
('16', 398, 8, 24, 884626) But there is one danger in this.
('16', 398, 8, 25, 884659) If I should get busy with a struggle even greater than the present one, he would not be in a position to go, much as you might desire.
('16', 398, 8, 26, 884794) This is, therefore, the right time for him to go and see you.
('16', 398, 8, 27, 884856) If you will bored there, you can come over here, though it is a little doubtful whether you will like being in Nadiad.

('16', 399, 8, 9, 885491) DEAR FRIEND,
('16', 399, 9, 10, 885504) I thought of writing to you many days ago but could not get time; the idea also went out of my mind.
('16', 399, 9, 11, 885605) I hope you will forgive me.
('16', 399, 9, 12, 885633) I beg leave to say that you have committed no mistake in sending over Mahadev to me.
('16', 399, 9, 13, 885718) This experience was necessary for his growth in life.
('16', 399, 9, 14, 885772) Money is not always the only thing necessary for one’s happiness.
('16', 399, 9, 15, 885838) It is not in Mahadev’s nature to find his happiness in money.
('16', 399, 9, 16, 885900) I think what is true of him will also be so with Durga, by and by.
('16', 399, 9, 17, 885967) Mahadev has been passing through invaluable experiences.
('16', 399, 9, 18, 886024) So far as I am concerned, the coming over of both has been nothing but a gain.
('16', 399, 9, 19, 886103) Mahadev has relieved me of many of my worries.
('16', 399, 9, 20, 886150) I was in search of a loving helpmate of his character and learning.
('16', 399, 9, 21, 886218) Having got Mahadev, I have succeeded in the search.
('16', 399, 9, 22, 886270) I did not think even in my dreams that it would be possible for me to find such good use for Chi.
('16', 399, 9, 23, 886368) Durga’s services.
('16', 399, 9, 24, 886386) Inscrutable are the ways of God.
('16', 399, 9, 25, 886419) I wish, I beg of you, that you will not worry yourself on account of these two but give them your full blessings.
('16', 399, 10, 26, 886533) Yours, etc.,

('16', 400, 3, 4, 886730) If people can be made to understand what is truly National Education and to cultivate a taste for it, the Government schools will be empty; and there will be no return thereto until the character of education in Government institutions is so radically altered as to accord with national ideals.

('16', 400, 6, 8, 887093) Mr. Gandhi said that the Government might take the revenue from the people with their consent and not by harassing them.
('16', 400, 6, 9, 887214) He emphatically said that the British could not be a blind rule.

('16', 400, 8, 12, 887341) NADIAD, April 9, 1918
('16', 400, 9, 13, 887363) DEAR SIR JAMES DUBOULAY, I thank you for your kind letter.
('16', 400, 9, 14, 887422) I know that we can have honest difference of opinion without questioning one another’s motives.
('16', 400, 9, 15, 887518) I promise not to misunderstand you in anything you say.
('16', 400, 10, 16, 887574) When I entered on the Kaira struggle I had no notion that I was attacking the whole revenue system.
('16', 400, 10, 17, 887674) I felt that I was attacking what in my opinion was a grave injustice to the people.
('16', 400, 10, 18, 887758) At the same time I confess that I would not have hesitated to enter upon the struggle even if it had meant an attack on the whole revenue system.
('16', 400, 10, 19, 887904) War had ever been present before me and I know that as a law abiding citizen and still more as a lover of the British Constitution I should at least hesitate

('16', 401, 1, 2, 888347) to embarrass the Government if I cannot actively co operate in the prosecution of War.
('16', 401, 1, 3, 888434) I have tried to do the latter so far as as I could.
('16', 401, 1, 4, 888486) But should anybody allow the War to cover injustice?
('16', 401, 1, 5, 888539) Should not the Government refrain from defying honest public opinion?
('16', 401, 1, 6, 888609) I do not say the people’s verdict be accepted in the Kaira matter.
('16', 401, 1, 7, 888676) But I do say that where there is a sharp difference of opinion, arbitration should be resorted to.
('16', 401, 1, 8, 888775) It is no pleasure to me to use adjectives for Talatis or for that matter anybody, but I know that it would be prudery in private matters, and a shirking of a painful duty in public matters, to shun adjectives where they describe material facts.
('16', 401, 1, 9, 889020) I wish you really knew them as I have come to know them.
('16', 401, 1, 10, 889077) You will then probably use stronger language than I have done.
('16', 401, 1, 11, 889140) Give me the committee I have asked for and I will show you what their estimates are worth and incidentally show you also what they are.
('16', 401, 1, 12, 889276) But here the fault is not theirs; the system under which they are working makes them so.
('16', 401, 1, 13, 889365) This however is much too large a question for me to discuss in the course of a letter.
('16', 401, 2, 14, 889452) The choice before me is quite clear.
('16', 401, 2, 15, 889489) I must either see discontent going deeper but being kept secret out of fear, or assist in making it publicly known in a disciplined manner and without fear of consequences.
('16', 401, 3, 16, 889662) No government, I agree, can afford to concede to popular clamour, nor can any government afford to ignore a strong public opinion even though the matter may be unreasonable so long as it is not immoral or destructive of the government itself.
('16', 401, 3, 17, 889905) In this case you may ignore New India but you may not ignore the opinion of the Kaira ryot in a matter concerning itself.
('16', 401, 3, 18, 890027) A government that will not yield to such public opinion deserves to be destroyed.
('16', 401, 3, 19, 890109) Indeed it courts destruction.
('16', 401, 3, 20, 890139) I am endeavouring to show both the Government and the people that all force is utterly useless before the force of the public opinion which disdains to use violence, and is based only on truth as it is apprehended by the people who are prepared to suffer to the uttermost.
('16', 401, 3, 21, 890412) The people of Kaira are receiving the richest education of their lives.
('16', 401, 3, 22, 890484) They are being taught not to strike for the right but to suffer for it with quiet but steadfast resignation, and whatever the consequences, they will have gained to the extent of their adherence to the principle I have ventured to enunciate.
('16', 401, 4, 23, 890726) I hope to run down to Bombay on Saturday.
('16', 401, 4, 24, 890768) Will you kindly let me know, either by letter or by wire, whether I could wait on you that

('16', 402, 6, 7, 891044) NADIAD, April 9, 1918
('16', 402, 7, 8, 891066) DEAR MR. PRATT, I thank you for your cordial note.
('16', 402, 7, 9, 891117) I would wait on you on Thursday the 11th instant at 9 a.m.
('16', 402, 7, 10, 891176) As to the laying down of weapons before coming to parley 1 I would do much to please you, but I feel that I shall most truly serve you by being disobedient in as orderly a manner as possible.
('16', 402, 7, 11, 891368) My disobedience is a defensive measure.
('16', 402, 7, 12, 891408) I would be no friend of law and order if I acted otherwise than I am doing.
('16', 402, 7, 13, 891484) I wish you were present at the meetings we have been having.
('16', 402, 7, 14, 891545) But I must not anticipate my pleading of Thursday.
('16', 402, 7, 15, 891596) This I know that behind my activity there is not a trace of ill will against any man on earth.
('16', 402, 7, 16, 891691) If 9 a.m., Thursday, too is inconvenient to you please send me your own time.

('16', 402, 13, 23, 891960) Surely a plea for justice is not inconsistent with my warning to the people to prepare for the worst.

('16', 403, 7, 10, 892716) DEAR FRIEND,
('16', 403, 8, 11, 892729) I have just heard that you have been saying to friends that it was only out of regard for me that you did not contradict me when I said that the result of your inquiry was the same as mine, so far as the annawari was concerned and that you [think] that I was uselessly making the people suffer.
('16', 403, 8, 12, 893024) I should be sorry if what I have heard is true.
('16', 403, 8, 13, 893072) You have every right and you owe it to a friend, as I deem myself to be to you, to say what you feel.
('16', 403, 8, 14, 893174) In public life there may arise hundreds of occasions when friends must differ and still remain friends.
('16', 403, 8, 15, 893278) Do please therefore tell me what you have been saying to the Committee there and otherwise too what your opinion is on the whole of my activity.
('16', 403, 8, 16, 893423) I know you will not mind if it does not convince me (assuming it is adverse).
('16', 403, 8, 17, 893501) You will believe me when I say that it will have due weight with me.

('16', 404, 10, 13, 894268) I am daily expecting your promised reply regarding Ali brothers.
('16', 404, 10, 14, 894333) You may know that I am engaged in a domestic quarrel with the local authority on the Kheda crops.
('16', 404, 10, 15, 894431) I am hoping that the cry of the people will have its due weight and that their opinion will be respected.What vexes me, however, is the case of the brothers Ali.
('16', 404, 10, 16, 894593) I seem to be ever worrying the administrators in the country when as a respectable citizen of the Empire I should be taking my share in the war.
('16', 404, 10, 17, 894738) I should have felt happier being in Mesopotamia.
('16', 404, 10, 18, 894787) or France.
('16', 404, 10, 19, 894798) I twice offered my services but they were not accepted.
('16', 404, 10, 20, 894854) I feel ashamed that since my arrival in India I can show no war work record in the conventional sense of the term.
('16', 404, 10, 21, 894969) On the contrary I seem to be making myself responsible for embarrassing situations and I may find myself in the midst of an agitation which might from its very magnitude cause grave anxiety to the Government.
('16', 404, 10, 22, 895178) I entertain too great a regard for Lord Chelmsford to wish to add to his anxieties and yet I dare not shirk an obvious duty

('16', 405, 1, 3, 895835) Their internment has soured the Muslim section.
('16', 405, 1, 4, 895883) As a Hindu I feel that I must not stand aloof from them.
('16', 405, 1, 5, 895940) I must assist in securing the release of the brothers, if I cannot justify the Government’s action by producing before the public a case against them.
('16', 405, 1, 6, 896091) If therefore the Government have a real case against the brothers, it should be produced and the atmosphere cleared.
('16', 405, 1, 7, 896208) If there is no producible cases I cannot help saying that the brothers should be discharged.
('16', 405, 1, 8, 896301) If Lord Chelmsford is of opinion that they ought not to be released, the Government must prepare for facing an agitation which must result in the incarceration of the leaders of it.
('16', 405, 1, 9, 896483) But I plead their discharge with all my strength.
('16', 405, 1, 10, 896533) The Government can only gain in prestige by responding to public opinion, and so far as danger to the State is concerned I can only say that I should lay down my life for it, if their release should mean any betrayal of trust.

('16', 406, 12, 24, 898582) If it goes under in this struggle, then for a long time the people of India will not be able to stand up.
('16', 406, 12, 25, 898688) There is wisdom in pausing for reflection before undertaking anything; but, having embarked on a thing, if we give it up, we only earn the title of cowards.
('16', 406, 12, 26, 898845) When the people lose their manliness, the country as a whole grows poor in spirit.
('16', 406, 12, 27, 898928) This struggle in Kheda is to secure suspension of land revenue.
('16', 406, 12, 28, 898992) There is a very important idea behind it.
('16', 406, 12, 29, 899034) That the Government is always in the right and the subjects are wrong: how can

('16', 407, 0, 1, 899233) 408 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 407, 1, 2, 899275) we tolerate this?
('16', 407, 1, 3, 899293) The Government says that authority must be respected.
('16', 407, 1, 4, 899347) Authority is blind and unjust.
('16', 407, 1, 5, 899378) A Government that says that such authority must be respected cannot last.
('16', 407, 1, 6, 899452) Under this British rule, we are taught from our childhood that theirs is a rule of justice.
('16', 407, 1, 7, 899544) This is their ideal.
('16', 407, 1, 8, 899565) It seems to me that, in place of this ideal, we have these days the rule of despotism.
('16', 407, 1, 9, 899652) That is why I say that we should rise against this Government.
('16', 407, 1, 10, 899715) I came over to Kheda district.
('16', 407, 1, 11, 899746) When we investigated the state of the crops, you proved to me and my co workers that they have been less than four annas.
('16', 407, 1, 12, 899868) If what you say is true, it is the duty of the Government to concede our demand.
('16', 407, 1, 13, 899949) And after all, what is it we have asked for?
('16', 407, 1, 14, 899994) Merely that collection of land revenue be suspended for a year and that, if they announce the suspension, those of us who have the means are ready to pay up.
('16', 407, 2, 15, 900152) If the Government does not concede even such a reasonable demand, what is the duty of the people?
('16', 407, 2, 16, 900250) The scriptures, too, enjoin that, if a king goes wrong, the people should point out his error to him.
('16', 407, 2, 17, 900352) Authority is blind and cannot readily see its own mistakes.
('16', 407, 2, 18, 900412) In this case, the Government is violating truth and doing injustice to the people, whereas we, speaking the truth, are asking for justice.
('16', 407, 2, 19, 900551) Truth ever prevails.
('16', 407, 2, 20, 900572) You ought to have this confidence that, if, for the sake of truth, we just abide by our pledge, there is no Government which will ruin its subjects for nothing.
('16', 407, 2, 21, 900733) 1 I hear people say that they are in misery.
('16', 407, 2, 22, 900778) But I have come here to tell you that, if we suffer voluntarily, we shall come through in the end.
('16', 407, 2, 23, 900877) I have placed my trust in the people of Kheda district.
('16', 407, 2, 24, 900933) Some have gone back on their pledge; to that extent the responsibility of the rest of us has increased.
('16', 407, 2, 25, 901037) If, of two or three carts one breaks down during a journey, the others will have a heavier load to carry.
('16', 407, 2, 26, 901143) I want you to bring lustre to the name of Kheda, famous as it is.
('16', 407, 2, 27, 901209) It is for you to fulfil my wish.
('16', 407, 2, 28, 901242) The day after tomorrow, you have been called by the Commissioner, to Nadiad.
('16', 407, 2, 29, 901319) He wants to talk, not to those who have paid up the land revenue, but to those specially who have not done so.
('16', 407, 2, 30, 901430) These should go positively.
('16', 407, 2, 31, 901458) Shed all fear, tell him of your pledge and say what you want.
('16', 407, 2, 32, 901520) The Commissioner will tell you that I am misleading you, that I have not advised you for your good.
('16', 407, 2, 33, 901620) He may perhaps say that I am a good man but that in this matter I have gone wrong.
('16', 407, 2, 34, 901703) But it was from you I collected the figures
('16', 407, 3, 35, 901747) 1 The Bombay Chronicle, 18 4 1918, reports Gandhiji to have said here: “That would raise them in the eyes of the world.
('16', 407, 3, 36, 901867) They bore no ill will towards Government; on the contrary they had great feelings for it.”

('16', 408, 1, 2, 902004) and the crops turned out to have been four annas.
('16', 408, 1, 3, 902054) That was the correct estimate and, therefore, you should corroborate it before Mr. Pratt.
('16', 408, 1, 4, 902144) None of you need be awed by him.
('16', 408, 1, 5, 902177) Our salvation lies in clinging to truth.
('16', 408, 1, 6, 902218) We are fighting for freedom.
('16', 408, 1, 7, 902247) 1 I would tell the women that they, too, must ask their husbands not to pay the Government’s dues, whatever the suffering you may have to go through.
('16', 408, 1, 8, 902397) If we stand by our pledge and uphold our honour, freedom is bound to follow.
('16', 408, 1, 9, 902474) Do everything necessary to ensure this.
('16', 408, 1, 10, 902514) To those who have paid up, my advice is that they should help the others to hold out.

('16', 408, 3, 12, 902633) 282. SPEECH AT SINHUJ
('16', 408, 4, 13, 902655) April 10, 1918
('16', 408, 5, 14, 902670) Before I say what I wish to, I should like to ask you how many of you have not paid the revenue.
('16', 408, 5, 15, 902767) 2 On coming here I learn that many women have been intimidated by the Government’s severity in this fight and that, in consequence, in the last two or three days, a large number have paid up the revenue.
('16', 408, 5, 16, 902971) I am sorry for those who have done this out of fear and all the more so for such of them who might have taken a pledge and have yet paid up.
('16', 408, 5, 17, 903112) There is wisdom in not taking a pledge, but a pledge once taken must be honoured.
('16', 408, 5, 18, 903194) Some will say that this struggle is merely to secure suspension of the Land revenue for a year.
('16', 408, 5, 19, 903290) Yes, that is true enough; but, in reality, the struggle is for an all important issue underlying the question of land revenue.
('16', 408, 5, 20, 903417) We must become absolutely fearless.
('16', 408, 5, 21, 903453) Fear is not for us, neither for men nor for women; fear is for beasts.
('16', 408, 5, 22, 903524) The day before yesterday I said by way of illustration that, on seeing the frightened eyes of the bullock when a car passes by, I am moved to pity.
('16', 408, 5, 23, 903672) As the car comes nearer, the bullock shakes with fear, and sometimes the car is in danger of being overturned.
('16', 408, 5, 24, 903783) The bullock’s fear is groundless.
('16', 408, 5, 25, 903817) We are in the same condition as this bullock.
('16', 408, 5, 26, 903863) It is a harsh comparison and does no credit
('16', 408, 6, 27, 903907) 1 The Bombay Chronicle report here has: “Independence, fearlessness, truth, these are virtues which we have to attain, They are dormant in our soul; if we cannot awaken them in ourselves, then we are not men but brutes.
('16', 408, 6, 28, 904127) We fight to obtain manliness.” 2 Most of those present raised their hands.
('16', 409, 0, 1, 904202) 410 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 409, 1, 2, 904244) to man, but that is the simple truth of the matter.
('16', 409, 1, 3, 904296) Why should we fear without any reason?
('16', 409, 1, 4, 904335) Neither the Talati nor the other officers hurt anyone, they simply cannot do so.
('16', 409, 1, 5, 904416) Even the ravanias only put questions and walk away.
('16', 409, 1, 6, 904468) They are rather scared, thinking that this is the people’s day.
('16', 409, 1, 7, 904532) On one side they are scared and, on the other, we are.
('16', 409, 1, 8, 904587) What a situation !
('16', 409, 2, 9, 904606) Let the Government, if it will, take away our cattle; hand over the ornaments, too, if it wants to seize them.
('16', 409, 2, 10, 904717) But there is one thing we will not give up and that is our self respect.
('16', 409, 2, 11, 904790) No one who does not maintain his self respect can be called a man of religion.
('16', 409, 2, 12, 904869) He who is afraid of God is afraid of none else.
('16', 409, 2, 13, 904917) He whom we have imagined as omnipotent and omniscient protects all and leads all to welfare.
('16', 409, 2, 14, 905010) How can you give in, betraying all those who, in this fight for truth and dharma, have bound themselves by a pledge?
('16', 409, 2, 15, 905127) To the friends who took fright, I should say, ‘‘Stand up, if you have courage enough and patriotism in you, and assure the others who are firm in their pledge that you will stand by them and, if they have to part with their lands or cattle, you will share yours with them.” Some of the women told me that, if I had come two days earlier, they would not have paid up.
('16', 409, 2, 16, 905494) I should say to these ladies, “If you would be true to your word, you should tell your husbands to spend their money on the community.” I told them in Borsad and Vasad, the day before yesterday, that a man who had yielded would feel like bringing down others and so, instead of admitting his weakness, would try to cover it up.
('16', 409, 2, 17, 905822) If any of you harbours such an idea, please banish it from your mind and give courage to the satyagrahis who have taken the pledge.
('16', 409, 2, 18, 905954) That is our sacred duty.
('16', 409, 2, 19, 905979) If you discharge this duty, at any rate, those who have taken the pledge will stick to it unflinchingly.
('16', 409, 2, 20, 906084) We want in this way to train and prepare the country, and show the right path to the Government which has chosen to disregard truth and justice; this is our aim in fighting.
('16', 409, 2, 21, 906258) It is sheer injustice to confiscate land worth ten thousand rupees to recover ten rupees of revenue.
('16', 409, 2, 22, 906359) If the Government wickedly perpetrates such monstrous injustice, I will go all out against it in the manner of an outlaw and advise you as well to do the same.
('16', 409, 2, 23, 906519) I cannot imagine the Government acting in this way for the sake of five or ten rupees.
('16', 409, 2, 24, 906606) These days, the Government rules by threats.
('16', 409, 2, 25, 906651) It is a wrong notion that a Government can be run on the basis of fear.
('16', 409, 2, 26, 906723) We should not fall a prey to such fear.
('16', 409, 2, 27, 906763) We have faith in the justice of Nature.
('16', 409, 2, 28, 906803) Do not obstruct the Government when it takes away your buffaloes nor hand over anything with your own hands.
('16', 409, 2, 29, 906912) We have all
('16', 410, 0, 1, 906924) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 411
('16', 410, 1, 2, 906970) these years been giving and obeying in fear, resentful inside.
('16', 410, 1, 3, 907033) In the result, we have come to be utterly abject.
('16', 410, 1, 4, 907083) Kheda yields crops of gold and its people are brave.
('16', 410, 1, 5, 907136) Despite the famine of 1956 1, they have, toiling day and night, turned the land into a garden.
('16', 410, 1, 6, 907231) How does it happen that the light has fled from their lands and their faces?
('16', 410, 1, 7, 907308) The only reason is that the people have begun to be afraid of the Government.
('16', 410, 1, 8, 907386) This fight is to emancipate ourselves from such a condition.
('16', 410, 1, 9, 907447) The success of this satyagraha in Kheda will have repercussions all over India.
('16', 410, 1, 10, 907527) Our salvation lies in our own hands.
('16', 410, 1, 11, 907564) By our own efforts shall we end our suffering.
('16', 410, 1, 12, 907611) In this struggle, we shall learn another wonder working idea, that we do not propose to fight with arms; we do not want to carry guns or spears; we shall fight with the weapon of truth.
('16', 410, 1, 13, 907797) He who bears this weapon has need of no other.
('16', 410, 1, 14, 907844) If, without harbouring any fear, we trust to truth and fight, we shall achieve a great success.
('16', 410, 1, 15, 907940) I hear that, in this satyagraha struggle against the Government, things are going on which are the opposite of truth.
('16', 410, 1, 16, 908058) When the officer asks the farmers why they do not pay, instead of telling him that the crops have been less than four annas, they are afraid and make other excuses.
('16', 410, 1, 17, 908223) We should not be rude to the mamlatdar or the Collector, though we need not submit to forced labour or give anything demanded as of right.
('16', 410, 1, 18, 908362) Indeed, they can order nothing from us.
('16', 410, 1, 19, 908402) On no account should we omit to extend to them common hospitality.
('16', 410, 1, 20, 908469) We may not give them anything free, but give them what they want against its full price.
('16', 410, 1, 21, 908558) We ought not to forget good manners.
('16', 410, 1, 22, 908595) Yesterday, it was brought to my notice that people refuse things even against money.
('16', 410, 1, 23, 908680) How can this be in a fight of the nature of satyagraha?
('16', 410, 1, 24, 908736) I was pained at this.
('16', 410, 1, 25, 908758) How may those who wish to be rid of tyranny tyrannize over others?
('16', 410, 1, 26, 908825) A third thing.
('16', 410, 1, 27, 908840) The Commissioner wants to address you and tell you something the day after tomorrow, at three o’clock, in the mamlatdar’s court in Nadiad.
('16', 410, 1, 28, 908979) I would advise all of you to attend.
('16', 410, 1, 29, 909016) They will even tell you that I am leading you astray.
('16', 410, 1, 30, 909070) It is not for me to judge whether I am leading you well or ill; I tell you only what seems right to me.
('16', 410, 1, 31, 909174) If it seems so to you as well, declare with one voice that, by following my advice, you command better respect and are able to safeguard your rights.
('16', 410, 1, 32, 909324) Mr. Pratt will not be angry at this.
('16', 410, 1, 33, 909361) He understands that, when the people are aggrieved, they have a right to complain.

('16', 411, 1, 3, 909646) Be fearless, all of you, and tell the Commissioner this: “Our lands, cattle or jewellery are not dearer to us than our plighted word, our self respect or our dharma.
('16', 411, 1, 4, 909812) Again and again we have pleaded with you and told you that our crops have been less than four annas.
('16', 411, 1, 5, 909913) Under the law, if the crops are less than four annas, collection of land revenue has to be suspended.
('16', 411, 1, 6, 910015) You took the Talatis’ word and not ours.
('16', 411, 1, 7, 910056) We have only one way open to us to convince you, and that is, not to pay the land revenue willingly.” Go to the meeting, all of you.
('16', 411, 1, 8, 910189) Listen carefully to what the Commissioner says and, if permitted, have your say.
('16', 411, 1, 9, 910270) Afterwards, come to the Hindu Anathashram.
('16', 411, 1, 10, 910313) We shall talk there.
('16', 411, 1, 11, 910334) The Government does not want anyone to be afraid.
('16', 411, 1, 12, 910384) We have been waving the flag of swaraj.
('16', 411, 1, 13, 910424) It is with our own efforts that we are to achieve it.
('16', 411, 1, 14, 910478) We shall certainly get it if we become absolutely fearless.
('16', 411, 1, 15, 910538) Whatever happens, do not pay the revenue.
('16', 411, 1, 16, 910580) Let the women give courage to their husbands.

('16', 411, 3, 21, 910827) April 11, 1918
('16', 411, 4, 22, 910842) As days pass, our ordeal grows severer.
('16', 411, 4, 23, 910882) I am coming straight from Ahmedabad after a meeting with the Commissioner.
('16', 411, 4, 24, 910957) We had a talk lasting an hour.
('16', 411, 4, 25, 910988) He told me of the proposed public meeting in Nadiad.
('16', 411, 4, 26, 911041) I assured him that the agriculturists would attend it.
('16', 411, 4, 27, 911096) I hope all those who have not paid up the land revenue will go to the meeting and see what the Commissioner advises.
('16', 411, 4, 28, 911213) He may tell you that, despite the failure of crops, it is the people’s duty to pay the Government the land revenue.
('16', 411, 4, 29, 911329) Maybe, he is right.
('16', 411, 4, 30, 911349) On my part, I shall only tell you that you should remain loyal, till the very end, to the pledge you have taken.
('16', 411, 4, 31, 911462) Tell him the whole story from the beginning to the end.
('16', 411, 4, 32, 911518) If you take your pledge seriously, be firm and give him your side of the
('16', 411, 5, 33, 911591) 1 A report in The Bombay Chronicle, 18 4 1918, here has: “Give courage to your husbands, to your children, to your brethren, like women of old and make them firm in their vow.” 2 The meeting which was held at the Dharmashala in Vadod, a village in the Anand Taluka, was attended by people from the surrounding villages.

('16', 412, 1, 2, 911957) case: Why you have taken the pledge; whether you took it knowing full well what you were doing, and also what you hope to gain from it.
('16', 412, 1, 3, 912093) Tell him all this plainly.
('16', 412, 1, 4, 912120) This is not a struggle merely to escape payment of the revenue this year.
('16', 412, 1, 5, 912194) I have been saying this at every place.
('16', 412, 1, 6, 912234) Through this struggle we want to bring home to the Government that it ought to yield to the people.
('16', 412, 1, 7, 912334) No king can remain in power if he sets himself against the people.
('16', 412, 1, 8, 912401) I have taken it as the chief mission of my life to prove this.
('16', 412, 1, 9, 912464) Our people have lost their spirit.
('16', 412, 1, 10, 912499) Their wealth has been drained away.
('16', 412, 1, 11, 912535) There is no light in their eyes.
('16', 412, 1, 12, 912568) 1 There is a comparison which comes to my mind again and again.
('16', 412, 1, 13, 912632) Government is to the subjects what a car approaching a bullock is to the latter, be it the British Government or a native State.
('16', 412, 1, 14, 912761) As the car comes on, tears gather in the bullock’s eyes and he begins to sweat; in the same way, the people shake with fear of the authority of their Government.
('16', 412, 1, 15, 912923) I cannot bear to see this.
('16', 412, 1, 16, 912950) You should be able to tell the Government that it may grant relief under its own law.
('16', 412, 1, 17, 913036) If you can bring it to do this, you will have some life in you in place of this abjectness of yours.
('16', 412, 1, 18, 913137) In the morning we repeat the names of innumerable rishis and satis.
('16', 412, 1, 19, 913205) We chant the names of Sita and Rama, Nala and Damayaanti, Prahlad and so on.
('16', 412, 1, 20, 913282) And for what?
('16', 412, 1, 21, 913296) To get inspiration from their lives.
('16', 412, 1, 22, 913333) The scriptures say that those human beings who pass their lives as beasts will be born as beasts in their next lives.
('16', 412, 1, 23, 913451) You went to the Collector, you went to the Commissioner and then to the Bombay Government and gave up the effort at last when you failed everywhere.
('16', 412, 1, 24, 913600) If that is the truth, I must say that to submit in this helpless fashion is to behave in the manner of a beast.
('16', 412, 1, 25, 913712) We may find our happiness either in killing or being killed.
('16', 412, 1, 26, 913773) The first way is that of beasts, the second that of man.
('16', 412, 1, 27, 913830) The soul of a beast is ever asleep, a man’s ever awake.
('16', 412, 1, 28, 913886) We can never prosper till we are fully grown and awake in our souls.
('16', 412, 1, 29, 913955) 2 I shall tell you a story from the Puranas.
('16', 412, 1, 30, 914000) There was a certain rishi; the fire emitted from between his brows put an end to all suffering.
('16', 412, 1, 31, 914096) The point of this text is that, when the soul becomes alive, all miseries end and so the injustices perpetrated by the
('16', 412, 2, 32, 914215) 1 Reports in The Bombay Chronicle, 16 4 1918, and New India, I7 4 1918 have Gandhiji saying here: “The nation is emasculated?
('16', 412, 2, 33, 914341) and there is no way out of it but that of keeping fast to our anchor while we are passing through a supreme ordeal.” 2 Reports in The Bombay Chronicle and New India add here: “ .
('16', 412, 2, 34, 914520) only by treading down brute force and planting soul force in its stead was the eternal wakefulness of the soul and consequently our salvation possible,”

('16', 413, 1, 2, 914715) Government will be no more when we become alive in our soul.
('16', 413, 1, 3, 914776) I want to put this truth to you in the plainest terms.
('16', 413, 1, 4, 914831) We want happiness in place of the present misery; if so, we should suffer voluntarily and lay down our lives for the sake of truth.
('16', 413, 1, 5, 914963) He who knows the power of truth and has realized it in his being is ever happy.
('16', 413, 1, 6, 915043) I may lose my all, but none can deprive me of the joy in my soul.
('16', 413, 1, 7, 915109) I want you to know that joy.
('16', 413, 1, 8, 915138) We need to become religious minded.
('16', 413, 1, 9, 915174) We must learn to speak the truth and walk in the way of truth.
('16', 413, 1, 10, 915237) The ravanias are welcome to come every day and bring orders of attachment.
('16', 413, 1, 11, 915312) I would tell you, out of regard for your pledge, let them dispossess you of all you have; be as fakirs but do not budge an inch.
('16', 413, 1, 12, 915441) This is the dharma for a man.
('16', 413, 1, 13, 915471) I assure the women that we shall not starve.
('16', 413, 1, 14, 915516) What we lose today we shall get back tomorrow; but, once our pledge is violated, it is violated for ever.
('16', 413, 1, 15, 915622) We should preserve our good name and our pledge, our dignity and manliness.
('16', 413, 1, 16, 915698) This is the legacy we should leave to posterity.
('16', 413, 1, 17, 915747) May God give you strength, and may you make your name ever so glorious!
('16', 413, 1, 18, 915819) Those friends who have taken the pledge may please reassure us.
('16', 413, 1, 19, 915883) Let me have it from you that the universe may go to pieces and the sun may fail to rise, but you will not go back on your pledge.
('16', 413, 2, 20, 916013) Say: “You may cut off our heads if you please, but we will not pay the land revenue.
('16', 413, 2, 21, 916098) We shall not submit to the Government’s injustice.

('16', 414, 2, 3, 916516) [NADIAD,] April 12, 1918
('16', 414, 3, 4, 916541) DEAR PROF.
('16', 414, 3, 5, 916552) GEDDES 2, I am truly thankful to you for your very kind letter.
('16', 414, 3, 6, 916616) You would not be more pained than I am over our base imitation of the West.
('16', 414, 3, 7, 916692) I want a great deal from you but nothing indiscriminately.
('16', 414, 3, 8, 916751) I take part in the spectacles such as the one at Indore 3 in order that I may reach and touch the hearts of the people and wean them from materialism as much as possible.
('16', 414, 3, 9, 916922) There is a materialistic view of the vernacular question and the religions.
('16', 414, 3, 10, 916998) I am endeavouring to place the latter before them.
('16', 414, 3, 11, 917049) The success of the Conference is to be measured by the extent to which I have been able
('16', 414, 4, 12, 917137) 1 This was sent in reply to Geddes’ letter, the main points of which were as follows, as recorded by Mahadev Desai: (1) It (Conference) was really perfectly English, with the succession of decorous speeches, by the proper persons, in the proper tone and with the proper conviction.
('16', 414, 4, 13, 917419) (2) No great public conference has yet given English a thought, yet at Stratford on Avon they play Shakespeare.
('16', 414, 4, 14, 917531) Your theatres were silent.
('16', 414, 4, 15, 917558) No sign of Tulsidas.
('16', 414, 4, 16, 917579) (3) Why not take examples and methods from the West—like the Welsh “Eisteddfod”?—at the one before last I heard Lloyd George in his utmost vigour, his most flavouring mood, since tensely in his own vernacular—He said, “I have come here to sing.” (4) Their pandal was divided into groups of each quality of voice for collective song.
('16', 414, 4, 17, 917912) (5) The Irish, reviving their language, may give you hints, e.g., establishment of small vacation gatherings.
('16', 414, 4, 18, 918022) (6) Look to Provence—a great folk poet—Mistral.
('16', 414, 4, 19, 918070) They do him honour, they reopened the ancient Graeco Roman theatres of their region and brought from .
('16', 414, 4, 20, 918173) Sarah Bernhardt and her company not simply to do their plays but to start their own acting at the highest level, and when the Swedes gave old Mistral the Nobel Prize, he built the Musee Provencal—no mere glass case museum.
('16', 414, 4, 21, 918396) (7) In Denmark a Bishop and a layman laid their heads together and set about re educating the youths and maidens not with the 3 R’s but with plough and cow and tale and song.
('16', 414, 4, 22, 918571) (8) You want for your meetings no mere transient pandal with its poor acoustics, but the open air theatre and amphitheatre where the Greeks perfected their language and literature.
('16', 414, 4, 23, 918752) (9) Support strongly the plea of uniting Hindi and Urdu.
('16', 414, 4, 24, 918809) It is very much like the union of the Saxon and the French vocabulary.
('16', 414, 4, 25, 918880) English theme gained the best qualities of each— the homely directness and force of the Germanic languages yet gained a new precision, new dignity from the clerical side.
('16', 414, 4, 26, 919051) Might not therefore the union of Urdu and Hindi be worked up by the institution of essays and prize poems for next conference?” 2 He was at the time Director, Bombay School of Economics.
('16', 414, 4, 27, 919238) 3 The reference is to the Hindi Literary Conference held on March 29 31 over which Gandhiji presided.

('16', 415, 1, 2, 919382) to touch the religions in [the] audience before me.
('16', 415, 1, 3, 919434) I tried last year to do away with the pandal for the Congress and suggested a meeting on the Maidan early in the morning.
('16', 415, 1, 4, 919556) That is the Indian style and it is the best.
('16', 415, 1, 5, 919601) I wonder if the amphitheatre is an improvement.
('16', 415, 1, 6, 919649) My ideal is speaking to the crowd from under a tree.
('16', 415, 1, 7, 919702) Never mind if the voice does not reach the thousands, nay millions.
('16', 415, 1, 8, 919770) They come not to hear but to see.
('16', 415, 1, 9, 919804) And they see far more than we can imagine.
('16', 415, 1, 10, 919847) Amphitheatres suggest a limitation to the space capacity.
('16', 415, 1, 11, 919905) The merit lies in an unlimited number being able to come and yet doing their work in an orderly manner.
('16', 415, 1, 12, 920009) Such were the annual fairs of old.
('16', 415, 1, 13, 920044) We have but to introduce religion into the new social and political life and you have a perfect organization in working order to fall back upon.
('16', 415, 1, 14, 920189) But what is the use of my writing?
('16', 415, 1, 15, 920224) Both of us are preoccupied.
('16', 415, 1, 16, 920252) The wretched fever of the West has taken possession of us.
('16', 415, 1, 17, 920311) We have no leisure for things eternal.
('16', 415, 1, 18, 920350) The utmost that can be said of us is that we do hanker after the eternal though our activity may belie our profession.
('16', 415, 1, 19, 920469) I shall treasure your letter.
('16', 415, 1, 20, 920499) May I make public use of it?
('16', 415, 1, 21, 920528) And do please tell me how I may build cheap and durable houses—from the foundation to the roof.
('16', 415, 2, 22, 920624) Yours sincerely,

('16', 415, 6, 27, 920753) [NADIAD,] April 12, 1918
('16', 415, 7, 28, 920778) DEVDAS, I have your letter.
('16', 415, 7, 29, 920806) I also wrote one to you, which you must have received.
('16', 415, 7, 30, 920861) You have said nothing about your health.
('16', 415, 7, 31, 920902) I am greatly pleased to learn that you have been attending on nursing the sister.
('16', 415, 7, 32, 920984) We read in our holy books that pupils used to volunteer their services to their teachers.
('16', 415, 7, 33, 921074) Your way of putting the thing is as natural and sweet as in those books.
('16', 415, 7, 34, 921147) I do not know how to measure the height to which this service will raise you.
('16', 415, 7, 35, 921225) It is quite easy to understand why I did not ask for 35 per cent

('16', 416, 1, 2, 921336) [increase] for more than one day.
('16', 416, 1, 3, 921370) It was impossible for me to stretch the matter any further.
('16', 416, 1, 4, 921430) The employers even now think that they agreed to give so much not because of any firmness on the workers’ part but on account of my fast.
('16', 416, 1, 5, 921568) I would have been guilty of a kind of violence if I had asked for more.
('16', 416, 1, 6, 921640) In accepting the minimum when I was in a position to ask for more, I showed straight forwar dness, modesty and good sense.
('16', 416, 1, 7, 921763) Had I not fasted, it is certain that the workers would have yielded.
('16', 416, 1, 8, 921832) They kept firm because of the fast.
('16', 416, 1, 9, 921868) A pledge so kept [by the workers] can justify only a demand placed at the lowest.
('16', 416, 1, 10, 921950) We can have it respected merely in the letter.
('16', 416, 1, 11, 921997) This one was so respected and, because I placed the demand at the minimum, I made up in a way, indeed in great measure, for the flaws which had tainted my fast.
('16', 416, 1, 12, 922158) Esther understood the significance of the fast very clearly.
('16', 416, 1, 13, 922219) She wired me a sentence from the Bible.
('16', 416, 1, 14, 922259) It means:
('16', 416, 2, 15, 922269) Greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.
('16', 416, 3, 16, 922347) I look upon that fast as the best thing I have done so far.
('16', 416, 3, 17, 922407) The peace which I knew at the time of that fast was no mere human experience.
('16', 416, 4, 18, 922485) I do not get here the joy which I found in my work at Ahmedabad.
('16', 416, 4, 19, 922550) I feel uneasy in mind and keep thinking of all manner of things.
('16', 416, 4, 20, 922615) Sometimes, I feel people have understood the idea all right; at other times, I fancy that they have not understood it and so feel pained.
('16', 416, 4, 21, 922753) To be sure, excellent work is being done, but now the mind is fatigued.
('16', 416, 4, 22, 922825) It is a crushing burden I carry, that of the fight for Mohammed Ali.
('16', 416, 4, 23, 922894) I have no choice but to bear it.
('16', 416, 4, 24, 922927) I cherish the hope that God will give me the strength for it and, because of that hope, I am calm in the inmost depths of my heart.
('16', 416, 4, 25, 923059) Ba is with me.
('16', 416, 5, 26, 923074) Tell Chhotalal that his pen appears to have grown stale again.
('16', 416, 5, 27, 923137) Let me have more details about the progress in weaving.

('16', 417, 10, 17, 924001) BHAISHRI BALWANTRAIJI, I have your letter.
('16', 417, 10, 18, 924044) It bespeaks your love for me.
('16', 417, 10, 19, 924074) I am grateful.
('16', 417, 10, 20, 924089) I have already written to Natarajan that he has been hasty in forming the opinion he has done.
('16', 417, 10, 21, 924184) 4 Instead of dealing with your arguments, I would rather explain what I mean by “satyagraha”.
('16', 417, 10, 22, 924278) Although I use the phrase “passive resistance”, it does not fully connote what I have in mind.
('16', 417, 10, 23, 924373) Please forget all about it.
('16', 417, 10, 24, 924401) I apply to political matters the same law which regulates our conduct in the family.
('16', 417, 10, 25, 924486) In India, I find that people act under the shadow of fear, do not tell the truth out of fear, deceiving themselves and the Government.

('16', 418, 1, 2, 925022) officer can ruin the reputation of a big man of wealth.
('16', 418, 1, 3, 925078) I think it is the duty of every leader to get out of this state of mind.
('16', 418, 1, 4, 925151) The officers are not amenable to the public.
('16', 418, 1, 5, 925196) They think their actions are divinely inspired and cannot conceivably be opposed.
('16', 418, 1, 6, 925278) It will be a service to them, and therefore to the State, to help them get rid of this notion.
('16', 418, 1, 7, 925373) Wherever, therefore, I find people submitting to injustice out of fear, I tell them that, to shake off imposed hardships, they must suffer voluntarily.
('16', 418, 1, 8, 925525) This is satyagraha.
('16', 418, 1, 9, 925545) To make others suffer in order to save ourselves from suffering is duragraha, brute force.
('16', 418, 1, 10, 925636) When a bullock is hurt, he kicks.
('16', 418, 1, 11, 925670) When a man is oppressed, he should employ soul force to fight himself free, suffering voluntarily to that end.
('16', 418, 2, 12, 925781) This is not the first time that hell has been let loose on the people of Kheda district.
('16', 418, 2, 13, 925870) In the past too they have suffered much.
('16', 418, 2, 14, 925911) Even the womenfolk of that place tell my wife of it.
('16', 418, 2, 15, 925964) This time, they spoke out against the hardship of having to pay the land revenue.
('16', 418, 2, 16, 926046) If they pay up, it will be done not willingly but through fear.
('16', 418, 2, 17, 926110) For doing so, many of them will have to part with their cattle or have their valuable trees cut down.
('16', 418, 2, 18, 926212) How can one bear to see this suffering?
('16', 418, 2, 19, 926252) I have seen it with my own eyes.
('16', 418, 2, 20, 926285) What is the way out?
('16', 418, 2, 21, 926306) Should I send petitions?
('16', 418, 2, 22, 926331) Natarajan says that we should approach the Viceroy or proceed to England.
('16', 418, 2, 23, 926405) What relief will this bring to the riots?
('16', 418, 2, 24, 926447) The trees will have been cut down meanwhile and the dues paid.
('16', 418, 2, 25, 926510) What will be the point of agitating thereafter?
('16', 418, 2, 26, 926558) Let it be understood that the struggle is not for amendment of the law but against the manner of its administration.
('16', 418, 2, 27, 926675) What is the use of an appeal after a convict is hanged?
('16', 418, 2, 28, 926731) Many an innocent person has been so hanged and all that through our indifference.
('16', 418, 2, 29, 926813) We had only two courses open to us.
('16', 418, 2, 30, 926849) Either resist the tax collector by force or tell him in all civil that we would not pay the tax.
('16', 418, 2, 31, 926946) “He will recover it, all the same; in what way will you have saved the people, then?” Surely, you will not put this question?
('16', 418, 2, 32, 927072) If you do, I have given my reply in the very beginning.
('16', 418, 3, 33, 927128) It happens, incidentally, that in this struggle the people are being educated about religion, right conduct, unity, truth and non violence and the Government to respect public opinion.
('16', 418, 3, 34, 927313) There is no room for hatred at all.
('16', 418, 3, 35, 927349) We have no desire to seek relief by bringing pressure on the Government, but by awakening its sense of justice.
('16', 418, 3, 36, 927461) The outcome will in every case be good.
('16', 418, 3, 37, 927501) In the end, people will have but grown stronger in spirit.
('16', 418, 3, 38, 927560) What will it matter even if, being weak, the people surrender?
('16', 418, 3, 39, 927623) Self suffering never goes in vain.

('16', 419, 1, 2, 927700) If they fall, they will fall to rise again.
('16', 419, 1, 3, 927744) No step along this path is ever wasted, No obstacle undoes the progress made; Even a little of this dharma Saves one from great danger.

('16', 419, 7, 9, 928039) April 12, 1918
('16', 419, 8, 10, 928054) The friends here have come after doing an important piece of work.
('16', 419, 8, 11, 928121) They told the Commissioner boldly what it was necessary that he should be told.
('16', 419, 8, 12, 928201) That to my mind is our victory.
('16', 419, 8, 13, 928233) The aim behind this struggle is to cultivate enough courage to be able to speak to the officers as to friends and equals, and get our demand conceded by the Government.
('16', 419, 8, 14, 928402) The fact that the Commissioner spoke in a friendly and courteous manner should itself be regarded as our victory.
('16', 419, 8, 15, 928516) A victory is all the more a victory for ‘our having clung to justice and truth through all suffering.
('16', 419, 8, 16, 928618) The Commissioner had told me, very courteously though, that the Government would confiscate lands and I had replied with equal courtesy and gentleness that it was welcome to do so but that it would not find the business profitable.
('16', 419, 8, 17, 928850) In case of a difference between the Government and the people, the principle of panch 2 must be accepted.
('16', 419, 8, 18, 928956) We are fighting for this principle.
('16', 419, 8, 19, 928992) Considering the matter from the point of view of dharma, it is obligatory to have recourse to a panch.
('16', 419, 8, 20, 929095) The relationship of the Government and its subjects is that of father and son, not of master and slave.
('16', 419, 8, 21, 929199) It is the duty of a son to resist injustice on the part of his father.
('16', 419, 8, 22, 929270) To those who have taken the pledge, it is my advice that they
('16', 419, 9, 23, 929332) 1 Bhagavad Gita, II, 40 2 Literally, “the five”; here an arbitrator
('16', 420, 0, 1, 929400) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 421
('16', 420, 1, 2, 929446) stick to it to the very end.
('16', 420, 1, 3, 929475) I shall fight on as long as they do not return to you the lands which have been confiscated.
('16', 420, 1, 4, 929568) I shall not give up the struggle while I live.
('16', 420, 1, 5, 929615) Only, you must also join it.
('16', 420, 1, 6, 929644) If you are prepared to suffer, not minding confiscation of your lands, I am with you.
('16', 420, 1, 7, 929730) Harishchandra suffered in all sorts of ways, got himself sold to a low caste family and lost everything, but he clung to truth.
('16', 420, 1, 8, 929858) It is my hope that all of you will be such Harishchandras.
('16', 420, 1, 9, 929917) It is my unshakeable belief that to follow dharma is to live it.
('16', 420, 1, 10, 929982) Chanting of devotional songs and prayers does not amount to following dharma.
('16', 420, 1, 11, 930060) One must have unwavering faith in God.
('16', 420, 1, 12, 930099) We have thus to cultivate knowledge of the self, that is, knowledge of the powers of the soul.
('16', 420, 1, 13, 930194) Mr. Pratt has described me as a sannyasi.
('16', 420, 1, 14, 930236) He was both right and wrong.
('16', 420, 1, 15, 930265) I do not claim to be a sannyasi.
('16', 420, 1, 16, 930298) I am as liable to err as you; the difference is this, that I desire to be a sannyasi and constantly strive to be one.
('16', 420, 1, 17, 930416) It is my firm conviction that political problems can be solved through satyagraha.
('16', 420, 1, 18, 930499) That our struggle has brought about a change in Mr. Pratt’s attitude—this is soul force.
('16', 420, 1, 19, 930588) To lose one’s land in the fight is nothing very great.
('16', 420, 1, 20, 930643) It is a householder, not a sannyasi, who is in a position to sacrifice land.
('16', 420, 1, 21, 930720) They are not sannyasis in Europe who are shedding rivers of blood; they are but householders.
('16', 420, 1, 22, 930814) Mr. Lloyd George, running all over the place, himself and his possessions at the disposal of the country, is he a sannyasi?
('16', 420, 1, 23, 930938) Is the war which England is fighting one for land?
('16', 420, 1, 24, 930989) Surely not.
('16', 420, 1, 25, 931001) Why, she felt, should Germany be allowed to have her way?
('16', 420, 1, 26, 931059) Germany, too, on her part, is fighting for her self respect.
('16', 420, 1, 27, 931120) She wants to vindicate herself.
('16', 420, 1, 28, 931152) We have been assured by some others that we shall not starve.
('16', 420, 1, 29, 931214) The only assurance the people of Europe have is the strength of their arms.
('16', 420, 1, 30, 931290) They see so many of their sons dying every second, but they don’t shed tears over them.
('16', 420, 1, 31, 931378) You will have your lands back with honour in this struggle.
('16', 420, 1, 32, 931438) If you put up with the loss of your lands, sacrificing your very souls in doing so, you will earn a name for yourselves not only in Kheda district but in the whole of India.
('16', 420, 1, 33, 931612) Finally, I have only this to tell you: whatever the cost, honour the pledge you have taken with God as witness and with full knowledge and understanding.
('16', 420, 1, 34, 931766) And have faith, not in me, but in God.
('16', 420, 1, 35, 931805) What does it matter even if you lose your lands?
('16', 420, 1, 36, 931854) We shall earn greater respect and fame by doing so.
('16', 420, 1, 37, 931906) The Government will also take pride in ruling over such a brave people.
('16', 420, 1, 38, 931978) I once told Mr. Pratt that theirs was a rule of fear and terror
('16', 421, 0, 1, 932042) 422 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 421, 1, 2, 932084) and that, if they were to rule, instead, with love and due respect for the people, their rule would last for ever.
('16', 421, 1, 3, 932199) I have told you again and again, and do so emphatically even here, that, if you honour your pledge at all costs, victory is assuredly yours.

('16', 421, 4, 10, 932597) During the last four days, the war has taken a graver turn.
('16', 421, 4, 11, 932657) That strengthens me in my resolve to send the letter.
('16', 421, 4, 12, 932711) In all humility I ask Lord Chelmsford not only to release the brothers but take them in his counsel, as also Mr. Tilak.
('16', 421, 4, 13, 932831) They are not enemies of the State.
('16', 421, 4, 14, 932866) Without their help you will not have a contented India.

('16', 421, 8, 18, 933018) DEAR MR. CARMICHAEL 2, I met yesterday after the interview with you a small committee consisting of Sir Narayan Chandavarkar 3 and others.
('16', 421, 8, 19, 933157) I gave them the purport of the patient and prolonged interview you and Sir James Duboulay were good enough to grant me.
('16', 421, 8, 20, 933277) That committee asked me to give them the main purport in writing for publication.
('16', 421, 8, 21, 933359) But I feel that I should ask for your confirmation of the purport and permission for its publication.
('16', 421, 8, 22, 933461) I enclose herewith the purport.
('16', 421, 8, 23, 933493) Will you kindly endorse it if it represents your views correctly and let me know
('16', 421, 9, 24, 933574) 1 The reference is to the letter dated April 10, which was sent with this covering note.

('16', 422, 4, 6, 934065) NADIAD April 15, 1918
('16', 422, 5, 7, 934087) TO THE EDITOR THE CHRONICLE BOMBAY
('16', 422, 6, 8, 934122) SIR, The publication of the summary of the Commissioner’s Gujarati address to the Kaira cultivators 3 necessitates a reply in justice to the latter as also the workers.
('16', 422, 6, 9, 934291) I have before me a verbatim report of the speech.
('16', 422, 6, 10, 934341) It is more direct than the summary in the laying down of the Government policy.
('16', 422, 6, 11, 934421) The Commissioner’s position is that the revenue authorities’ decision regarding suspension is final.
('16', 422, 6, 12, 934522) They may and do receive and hear complaints from the ryots, but the finality of their decision cannot be questioned.
('16', 422, 6, 13, 934639) This is the crux of the struggle.
('16', 422, 6, 14, 934673) It is contended on behalf of the ryots that, where there are, in matters of administrative orders, sharp differences of opinion between local officials and them, the points of differences are and ought to be referred to an impartial committee of inquiry.
('16', 422, 6, 15, 934928) This, it is held, constitutes the strength of to the British Constitution.
('16', 422, 6, 16, 935003) The Commissioner has on principle rejected this position and invited a crisis.
('16', 422, 6, 17, 935082) And he has made such a fetish of it that he armed himself beforehand with a letter from Lord Wellingdon to the effect that even
('16', 422, 7, 18, 935210) 1 The addressee in reply wrote that the purport of the interview sent by Gandhiji did not adequately cover all the aspects discussed.
('16', 422, 7, 19, 935344) 2 The letter seems to have been released to the Press generally.
('16', 422, 7, 20, 935409) It was also published in Young India, 17 4 1918. 3 Some 2,000 of the principal agriculturists of the district had gathered at a meeting in Ahmedabad, convened with Gandhiji’s assistance, on April 12. It was attended by the Collector and other revenue officials.
('16', 422, 7, 21, 935671) Gandhiji deputed Vallabhbhai Patel to the meeting, but later found it necessary to speak in order to clear up a misunderstanding created by the commissioner’s speech.
('16', 422, 7, 22, 935838) For the text of this address, vide Appendix “Commissioner Pratt’s Speech”, 12 4 1918.
('16', 423, 0, 1, 935924) 424 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 423, 1, 2, 935966) he should not interfere with the Commissioner’s decision.
('16', 423, 1, 3, 936024) He brings in the War to defend his position and adjures the ryots and me to desist from our cause at this time of peril to the Empire.
('16', 423, 1, 4, 936159) But I venture to suggest that the Commissioner’s attitude constitutes a peril far graver than the German peril, and I am serving the Empire in trying to deliver it from this peril from within.
('16', 423, 1, 5, 936352) There is no mistaking the fact that India is waking up from its long sleep.
('16', 423, 1, 6, 936428) The ryots do not need to be literate to appreciate their rights and their duties.
('16', 423, 1, 7, 936510) They have but to realize their invulnerable power and no Government, however strong, can stand against their will.
('16', 423, 1, 8, 936625) The Kaira ryots are solving an Imperial problem of the first magnitude in India.
('16', 423, 1, 9, 936706) They will show that it is impossible to govern men without their consent.
('16', 423, 1, 10, 936780) Once the Civil Service realizes this position, it will supply to India truly Civil Servants who will be the bulwark of the people’s rights.
('16', 423, 1, 11, 936920) Today the Civil Service rule is a rule of fear.
('16', 423, 1, 12, 936968) The Kaira ryot is fighting for the rule of love.
('16', 423, 1, 13, 937017) It is the Commissioner who has produced the crisis.
('16', 423, 1, 14, 937069) It was, as it is now, his duty to placate the people when he saw that they held a different view.
('16', 423, 1, 15, 937167) The revenue of India will be no more in danger because a Commissioner yields to the popular demands and grants concessions than the administration of justice was in danger, when Mrs. Maybrick was reprieved purely in obedience to the popular will, or the Empire was in danger because a corner of a mosque in Cawnpore was replaced in obedience to the same demand.
('16', 423, 1, 16, 937529) Had I hesitated to advise the people to stand against the Commissioner’s refusal to listen to their prayer, instead of taking the open and healthy course it has taken, their discontent would have burrowed under and bred ill will.
('16', 423, 1, 17, 937759) That son is a true son of his father, who rather than harbour ill will against him, frankly but respectfully tells him all he feels and equally respectfully resists him, if he cannot truthfully obey his commands.
('16', 423, 1, 18, 937972) I apply the same law to the relations between the Government and the people.
('16', 423, 1, 19, 938049) There cannot be seasons when a man must suspend his conscience.
('16', 423, 1, 20, 938113) But just as a wise father will quickly agree with his son and not incur his ill will, especially if the family was in danger from without, even so a wise Government will quickly agree with the ryots, rather than incur their displeasure.
('16', 423, 1, 21, 938350) War cannot be permitted to give a licence to the officials to exact obedience to their orders, even though the ryots may consider them to be unreasonable and unjust.
('16', 423, 1, 22, 938516) The Commissioner steels the hearts of the ryots for continuing their course by telling them that for a revenue of four lakhs of rupees, he will for ever confiscate his hundred and fifty thousand acres of
('16', 424, 0, 1, 938720) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 425
('16', 424, 1, 2, 938766) land worth over 3 crores of rupees, and for ever declare the holders, their wives and children unworthy of holding any lands in Kaira.
('16', 424, 1, 3, 938901) He considers the ryots to be misguided and contumacious in the same breath.
('16', 424, 1, 4, 938977) These are solemn words:
('16', 424, 2, 5, 939001) Do not be under the impression that our mamlatdars and our Talatis will realize the assessment by attaching and selling your movable property.
('16', 424, 2, 6, 939144) We are not going to trouble ourselves so much.
('16', 424, 2, 7, 939191) Our officers’ time is valuable.
('16', 424, 2, 8, 939223) Only by your bringing in the monies shall the treasuries be filled.
('16', 424, 2, 9, 939291) This is no threat.
('16', 424, 2, 10, 939310) You take it from me that parents never threaten their children.
('16', 424, 2, 11, 939374) They only advise.
('16', 424, 2, 12, 939392) But if you do not pay the dues, your lands will be confiscated.
('16', 424, 2, 13, 939456) Many people say that this will not happen.
('16', 424, 2, 14, 939499) But I say it will.
('16', 424, 2, 15, 939518) I have no need to take a vow.
('16', 424, 2, 16, 939548) I shall prove that I mean what I say.
('16', 424, 2, 17, 939586) The lands of those who do not pay will be confiscated.
('16', 424, 2, 18, 939641) Those who are contumacious will get no lands in future.
('16', 424, 2, 19, 939697) Government do not want their names on their Records of Ryots.
('16', 424, 2, 20, 939759) Those who go out shall never be admitted again.
('16', 424, 2, 21, 939807) I hold that it is the sacred duty of every loyal citizen to fight unto death against such a spirit of vindictiveness and tyranny.
('16', 424, 2, 22, 939937) The Commissioner has done the Ahmedabad strikers and me a cruel wrong in saying that the strikers knowingly broke their vow.
('16', 424, 2, 23, 940062) He was present at the meeting where the settlement was declared.
('16', 424, 2, 24, 940127) He may hold that the strikers had broken their vow (though his speech at the meeting produced a contrary impression) but there is nothing to show that the strikers knowingly broke their vow.
('16', 424, 2, 25, 940318) On the contrary, it was entirely kept by their resuming their work on their getting for the first day wages demanded by them, and the final decision as to wages being referred to arbitration.
('16', 424, 2, 26, 940510) The strikers had suggested arbitration which the mill owners had rejected.
('16', 424, 3, 27, 940585) Their struggle in its essence was for a 35 per cent increase in their wages or such increase as an arbitration board may decide.
('16', 424, 3, 28, 940714) And this is what they have got.
('16', 424, 3, 29, 940746) The hit at the strikers and me is, I regret to have to say, a hit below the belt.
('16', 424, 4, 30, 940828) Yours, etc.,

('16', 425, 2, 3, 940955) NADIAD, April 15, 1918
('16', 425, 3, 4, 940978) DEAR MR. PRATT,
('16', 425, 4, 5, 940994) I thank you for your note.
('16', 425, 5, 6, 941021) I venture to think that you are prejudiced against the Home Rulers quite unnecessarily.
('16', 425, 5, 7, 941109) 1 They are not so bad as you think them to be.
('16', 425, 5, 8, 941156) In any case I must take the material that I see before me and improve it where it is bad.
('16', 425, 5, 9, 941246) I find the Home Rulers to be the easiest people to get on with not because I fall in with their views very quickly but because I appeal to their sense of right and wrong and am patient with them.
('16', 425, 5, 10, 941442) Finding mine to be the superior method they accept it in place of their own.
('16', 425, 5, 11, 941519) They try to substitute love for hatred.
('16', 425, 5, 12, 941559) You could do likewise and you can make them yours.
('16', 425, 6, 13, 941610) It is likely that both the Nadiad and the Ahmedabad Home Rulers have a valid answer to your charges.
('16', 425, 6, 14, 941711) Their selflessness in their relations with me disposes me to think that they are not likely to be guided by sordid motives in their conduct of Municipal affairs.
('16', 425, 6, 15, 941873) I ask you to trust them and secure their co operation.
('16', 425, 7, 16, 941928) The Kheda people do not render blind obedience to me.
('16', 425, 7, 17, 941982) They are not allowed to do so.
('16', 425, 7, 18, 942013) And I have no doubt that if they follow my advice to the last they cannot but be elevated morally.
('16', 425, 7, 19, 942112) For does not conscious suffering always exalt a nation?
('16', 425, 7, 20, 942168) The passive resisters of South Africa are today the strongest supporters of the Government.
('16', 425, 7, 21, 942260) Their resistance was based on faith in the Government’s ultimate justice.
('16', 425, 8, 22, 942334) Were you not cruelly unjust to the strikers and me?
('16', 425, 8, 23, 942386) Do you believe that the latter broke their vow?
('16', 425, 8, 24, 942434) And whatever may be your belief your suggestion that the strikers willingly broke the vow is surely the unkindest cut of all.
('16', 425, 8, 25, 942560) Your speech at the strikers’ meeting did not leave on my mind the impression that you created at the
('16', 425, 9, 26, 942661) 1 The addressee had written that “the argument for the protection of the poor did not come well from the Nadiad Home Rulers” who were busy receiving special services for well to do people at the cost of the tax payer.
('16', 425, 9, 27, 942879) He accused the Ahmedabad Home Rulers of securing special conservancy services at rates far below cost price.

('16', 426, 5, 7, 943286) DEAR SIR NARAYAN,
('16', 426, 6, 8, 943304) Here is Mr. Pratt’s speech.
('16', 426, 6, 9, 943332) The version I am sending is a full translation of the verbatim report taken by my reporter.
('16', 426, 6, 10, 943424) I send also a copy of my reply.
('16', 426, 6, 11, 943456) I send you also the Wadthal annawari report prepared by Mr. Ghosal and the correspondence thereon.
('16', 426, 6, 12, 943555) If the latter is not understandable please let me know.
('16', 426, 6, 13, 943611) The Wadthal correspondence shows clearly how much room there is for honest difference of opinion.
('16', 426, 6, 14, 943709) Only an impartial inquiry can bring about a satisfactory settlement.
('16', 426, 6, 15, 943778) Please let me know if you need further information.

('16', 426, 13, 23, 944031) In view of Mr. Pratt’s pronouncement are they not to be withdrawn?

('16', 427, 6, 10, 944870) I believe the lands will stand confiscated only on paper.
('16', 427, 6, 11, 944928) However, as you have taken the vow to bear every kind of suffering, I need say nothing to console you.
('16', 427, 6, 12, 945031) I offer you only congratulations.

('16', 427, 7, 14, 945110) 296. SPEECH AT OD
('16', 427, 8, 15, 945128) April 16, 1918 If a person whose name we chance to mention appears unexpectedly at the spot, we usually say that he will live to be a hundred years.
('16', 427, 8, 16, 945277) Thus has it happened here.
('16', 427, 8, 17, 945304) The moment we thought of Vallabhbhai, we sighted him coming this way.
('16', 427, 8, 18, 945374) I had hoped to meet you last week, but I could not come here as I had to go to Bombay, and was then at Ahmedabad to see Mr. Pratt.
('16', 427, 8, 19, 945505) Before I acquaint you with the talks I have had with the top officers whom I met in Bombay, let me tell you what I heard about you in Nadiad.
('16', 427, 8, 20, 945647) I was told that the people of Od are quite spirited but that they have, till now, used their courage and strength, not for their good, but in quarrelling and wrangling among themselves.
('16', 427, 8, 21, 945833) And so it happens that this soil of Kheda, fertile and lovely, which your forefathers had transformed into a land of gold, has been ruined while you have been stubbornly fighting of your claims against one another.
('16', 427, 8, 22, 946048) 2 We shall not succeed in a struggle of any kind so long as this state of affairs continues.
('16', 427, 9, 23, 946141) 1 A translation of this appeared also in New India, 23 4 19l8. 2 The Bombay Chronicle, 20 4 1918, reports Gandhiji as having said: “For years you have been exhausting your energy and fearlessness in fighting each other.
('16', 427, 9, 24, 946361) For once, rise and be united and use the same strong elements to fight the ‘fear of Sirkar’, the common enemy.”
('16', 428, 0, 1, 946473) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 429
('16', 428, 1, 2, 946519) have taken the pledge to carry on our struggle to the bitter end and secure justice.
('16', 428, 1, 3, 946604) I can assure you that, if we could forget our past enmities and live together harmoniously, success is ours.
('16', 428, 1, 4, 946713) Mr. Pratt, Mr. Carmichael and [Sir James] Duboulay shook heads and strongly disapproved of our struggle.
('16', 428, 1, 5, 946818) During the course of our talks, they remarked: “You do not know the people of Kheda.
('16', 428, 1, 6, 946903) We do not agree that this struggle will result in their progress and uplift or raise them morally.
('16', 428, 1, 7, 947002) Rather, it will teach them to be defiant.” I am telling you what opinion the top officials of the Revenue Department hold about you.
('16', 428, 1, 8, 947135) In the struggle you have embarked upon, you must maintain the utmost truthfulness, not partial.
('16', 428, 1, 9, 947231) When Prahlad was asked, “Where is your God Vishnu?”, he replied: “On land and in water, in the sky and in the nether regions; I see the Almighty Vishnu wherever I look.” In the same way, only if we find truth all round us may we call this struggle satyagraha.
('16', 428, 1, 10, 947491) We cannot have one set of manners in public and another in private.
('16', 428, 1, 11, 947559) Truth is all pervasive as the Essence that we know as Vishnu.
('16', 428, 1, 12, 947621) Just as we cannot say that Vishnu is non existent in a certain place, so also we cannot say that truth exists at one place but not at some other.
('16', 428, 1, 13, 947767) As you all belong to the same village and the same community and follow the same profession, you must learn to apologize to one another [for your errors] and live harmoniously.
('16', 428, 1, 14, 947944) Anyone who says that satyagraha may be used only against the Government has not understood the meaning of satyagraha at all.
('16', 428, 1, 15, 948069) We do not want to fight the Government with threats and arrogant defiance; we want to fight it by submitting ourselves voluntarily to suffering.
('16', 428, 1, 16, 948214) Those who suffer with understanding and knowledge to end suffering always succeed.
('16', 428, 1, 17, 948297) This is the only way for you if you wish to win in this struggle.
('16', 428, 1, 18, 948363) In Nayaka, notices of confiscation were issued to twenty five farmers and their lands were confiscated.
('16', 428, 1, 19, 948467) I wrote a letter 1 to congratulate these brave friends when I heard of this.
('16', 428, 1, 20, 948544) I told them that the confiscation would remain only in the Government records.
('16', 428, 1, 21, 948623) All the same, I said, their pledge was that they would remain adamant even if their lands were confiscated, that there was no need to cheer up satyagrahis.
('16', 428, 1, 22, 948779) They should have nothing but congratulations.
('16', 428, 1, 23, 948825) This being an occasion for rejoicing, I sent them congratulations, not consolations.
('16', 428, 1, 24, 948910) I appeal to you also to welcome gladly orders of confiscation.
('16', 428, 1, 25, 948973) I cannot even dream that the Government will ever be able to confiscate our lands.
('16', 428, 2, 26, 949056) 1 Vide the preceding item.
('16', 429, 0, 1, 949083) 430 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 429, 1, 2, 949125) That is impossible under British rule.
('16', 429, 1, 3, 949164) Should the impossible become possible, I shall have no way open to me but to make myself an outlaw against the British Government, which boils down to this, that the lands will not really be confiscated.
('16', 429, 1, 4, 949368) You have committed no crime in taking the pledge; on the contrary, by doing so, you have averred your loyalty to the State.
('16', 429, 1, 5, 949492) The crops having been less than four annas, we appealed for suspension of the collection of land revenue as provided in their law, made petitions, held meetings to ask for some relief and our representatives in the legislature tried all remedies provided in law.
('16', 429, 1, 6, 949755) The Government turned a deaf ear to all this.
('16', 429, 1, 7, 949801) What, then, should a brave, manly and loyal people do under the circumstances ?
('16', 429, 1, 8, 949881) The right relation between the Government and the people is that, in case of difference between the two, the former should always bow to popular opinion.
('16', 429, 1, 9, 950035) We do not demand that the Government should accept what we say and yield.
('16', 429, 1, 10, 950109) We ask that, if our case is proved, justice be done to us.
('16', 429, 1, 11, 950168) We asked for the appointment of arbitrators, but the Government turned down even that request.
('16', 429, 1, 12, 950263) Mr. Pratt believes that the people should have no say in the matter.
('16', 429, 1, 13, 950332) We have been victims of this policy for the last fifty years; we have become impoverished through fear.
('16', 429, 1, 14, 950436) We have not money enough for repairs to our houses.
('16', 429, 1, 15, 950488) Our crops grow poorer.
('16', 429, 1, 16, 950511) How can God look kindly on us either, so long as we remain such cowards?
('16', 429, 1, 17, 950584) Even the rains are regular where the king and his subjects are truthful in their dealings.
('16', 429, 1, 18, 950675) The two sides are at odds, each holding to its own view as a matter of prestige.
('16', 429, 1, 19, 950756) The people insist on their view of the matter being right and the Government on its.
('16', 429, 1, 20, 950841) We argue that the people are speaking the truth and yet there is no relief.
('16', 429, 1, 21, 950917) This struggle will show what the Government should do in case of difference between it and the people.
('16', 429, 1, 22, 951020) All India has its eyes upon you.
('16', 429, 1, 23, 951053) Have courage and hold out; don’t prove yourselves cowards.
('16', 429, 1, 24, 951112) It is prudence not to embark upon a venture but, having once done so, it is not for a brave man to give it up.
('16', 429, 1, 25, 951223) I have been told to beware of Patidars and the people of Gujarat in general.
('16', 429, 1, 26, 951300) But I look upon all as being no better or worse than I am.
('16', 429, 1, 27, 951359) All have the same atman and are equal in their powers.
('16', 429, 1, 28, 951414) We can have the atman grow as we will .
('16', 429, 1, 29, 951454) Such is my experience.
('16', 429, 1, 30, 951477) This is to your good and will secure you relief.
('16', 429, 1, 31, 951526) I hope, therefore, that you will hold on.
('16', 429, 1, 32, 951568) The Patidars are a venturesome community; they are Kshatriyas.
('16', 429, 1, 33, 951631) They know that their lands are theirs and so it is natural that they should be proud of them.
('16', 429, 1, 34, 951725) They should
('16', 430, 0, 1, 951737) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 431
('16', 430, 1, 2, 951783) not go back on their plighted word, should not betray their Kshatriya blood but fight on to the last and compel the Government to bow to public opinion.
('16', 430, 1, 3, 951936) If they can do this, swaraj is in the hollow of our palms.
('16', 430, 1, 4, 951995) Swaraj consists in knowing our rights and our duties.
('16', 430, 1, 5, 952049) Mr. Montagu may come over from England and grant us seemingly big rights, but they will avail us nothing unless we grow conscious of our rights and obligations.
('16', 430, 1, 6, 952210) This requires some education and training.
('16', 430, 1, 7, 952253) I should think you have some elementary knowledge and under standing of these matters.
('16', 430, 1, 8, 952340) I know likewise that you have taken the pledge in this struggle after full deliberation.
('16', 430, 1, 9, 952429) You must abide by it with an intelligent understanding of its spirit.
('16', 430, 1, 10, 952499) Malice has no place in this struggle; nor the sword, nor the dhariya 1. Our sole weapon is to abide by truth, and our arms are faith and courage.
('16', 430, 1, 11, 952645) Satyagraha knows no defeat.
('16', 430, 1, 12, 952673) To be sure, we shall suffer defeat if we value our lands more than our self respect.
('16', 430, 1, 13, 952758) I am confident that my faith in the people of Kheda will not prove to have been misplaced.
('16', 430, 1, 14, 952849) I pray you will give a good fight to the Government and bring glory to the name of Kheda.

('16', 430, 5, 18, 953004) NADIAD, Chaitra Sud 7, 1974 [April 17, 1918]
('16', 430, 6, 19, 953049) The most striking instance of the terrible excesses of Hinduism’s our treatment of the Antyajas.
('16', 430, 6, 20, 953146) How degrading and shameful it is, Shri Amritlal Padhiar has set out vividly in his Antyaj Stotra.
('16', 430, 6, 21, 953244) There is some exaggeration in it, thanks to the poet in him, but it is slight.
('16', 430, 6, 22, 953323) Shri Padhiar has given a heart rending picture which cannot but fill the reader with horror to the very roots of his being.
('16', 430, 6, 23, 953447) He has poured forth his indignation in the stotra.
('16', 430, 6, 24, 953498) It should be read out to men and women in their millions, in the same way that works like the Bhagavat are read out to them in every square.
('16', 430, 6, 25, 953639) Till we have rid ourselves of this taint of untouchability, the big question will remain whether we have become fit for swaraj.
('16', 430, 6, 26, 953767) If slave owners can be said to be fit, then perhaps we are.
('16', 430, 6, 27, 953827) Let it not be forgotten that we are ourselves under subjection at present.
('16', 430, 6, 28, 953902) Those who desire to be free
('16', 430, 7, 29, 953930) 1 A curved, sickle like blade fixed to a long stick
('16', 431, 0, 1, 953982) 432 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 431, 1, 2, 954024) from this state should all the more pay attention to their own evils.
('16', 431, 1, 3, 954094) The little, mole like faults of those who have fallen on evil times seem to others as huge as the Himalayas.
('16', 431, 1, 4, 954203) Something of this kind has happened about our conduct towards the Antyajas; what is more to the point, the evil itself is a Himalayan one and hence it obstructs our progress.
('16', 431, 1, 5, 954378) I have studied, with care and in a spirit of humility, the controversy which has followed in the wake of the Antyaj Conference at Godhra.
('16', 431, 1, 6, 954516) 1 I have not come across a single convincing reason justifying the practice of untouchability.
('16', 431, 1, 7, 954611) Where the scriptures themselves are under attack, to quote from them is like the blind man denying the existence of what he does not see.
('16', 431, 1, 8, 954749) If we cannot defend our conduct by reason, the authority of scriptures is no avail.
('16', 431, 1, 9, 954833) They cannot be above reason and morality.
('16', 431, 1, 10, 954875) If these latter are given the go by any fraud can be justified in the name of religion.
('16', 431, 2, 11, 954963) We shall have to make such a sustained effort to purge ourselves of this terrible sin that, as Shri Padhiar points out, the effort will by itself raise us very high.
('16', 431, 2, 12, 955129) If we make it in our traditional manner, we shall have achieved our aim while advancing in the path of dharma; if we follow the method they do in the West, a gulf will be created between us and the Antyajas.
('16', 431, 3, 13, 955337) It is cowardly for anyone to suggest that the Antyajas will be emancipated when the old generation has passed away.
('16', 431, 3, 14, 955453) Our worth as men consists in doing tapascharya and awakening in our elders compassion and the purest sense of dharma.
('16', 431, 3, 15, 955571) That and nothing less is our duty.
('16', 431, 3, 16, 955606) If we boldly translate our words into action, the task can be accomplished quite soon.
('16', 431, 3, 17, 955693) It is a mean desire to wish to kill an enemy so that one may rule over his kingdom afterwards; dharma consists in winning him over to our way of thinking and converting him into a friend.
('16', 431, 3, 18, 955881) Shri Padhiar will have to shake off his cowardice.

('16', 432, 1, 2, 956090) 298. MESSAGE T0 SATYAGRAHI AGRICULTURISTS 1
('16', 432, 2, 3, 956134) NADIAD, April 17, 1918
('16', 432, 3, 4, 956157) You did well to listen to Mr. Pratt attentively and courageously.
('16', 432, 3, 5, 956223) That is the right way for satyagrahis.
('16', 432, 3, 6, 956262) We have had to disobey the orders of the Government about revenue, but we should not fail in the courtesy due to Government officers.
('16', 432, 3, 7, 956396) We want freedom from fear and slavery, but have no desire to forget our manners.
('16', 432, 3, 8, 956477) Rude, of course, we can never be.
('16', 432, 3, 9, 956511) In satyagraha, one should always show due courtesy.
('16', 432, 3, 10, 956563) The Commissioner pointed out the rights as also the duties of agriculturists and his advice in regard to both was worthy enough, but the gentleman failed to say that every human being has one fundamental right and obligation.
('16', 432, 3, 11, 956789) A man owes it as a duty to refuse to do anything out of fear and, therefore, when anyone holds out a threat in order to force him to do something, he has a right to resist.
('16', 432, 3, 12, 956962) By virtue of this right, the people of Kheda are at present respectfully disobeying the Government’s order.
('16', 432, 3, 13, 957070) We believe that the crops this year have been less than four annas and that, accordingly, the collection of Government dues should be suspended.
('16', 432, 3, 14, 957215) If, therefore, we pay the assessment which ought to have been suspended, we shall be doing so only out of fear that our movable property or our lands might be confiscated.
('16', 432, 3, 15, 957387) If we give way to this fear, we shall become incapable of any manly effort.
('16', 432, 3, 16, 957463) About eighty per cent of the farmers have paid up the dues out of this fear and, therefore, it is for the remaining twenty per cent to redeem the honour of all.
('16', 432, 3, 17, 957624) Anyone who has lost his manliness cannot even show true loyalty.
('16', 432, 3, 18, 957689) The difference between animals and man lies only in the latter’s manliness.
('16', 432, 3, 19, 957765) This is a fight for asserting our manliness.
('16', 432, 4, 20, 957810) If the orders of the Revenue Department or any other Government orders are not revised despite petitions, it is not the spirit of the British Constitution that they must be obeyed meekly.
('16', 432, 4, 21, 957998) There is no such political doctrine.
('16', 432, 4, 22, 958035) It is the birth right and the duty of the people to disobey orders which, on mature consideration, they regard as unjust or oppressive.
('16', 432, 4, 23, 958171) The rule which obtains in the affairs of a family is equally applicable to the relations of a Government and its
('16', 432, 5, 24, 958284) 1 Gandhiji dealt with Commissioner Pratt’s speech in his letter to the Press dated April 15. According to Mahadev Desai, Gandhiji issued this as a pamphlet to elaborate the points he had made in his speech at Nadiad on April 12.
('16', 433, 0, 1, 958513) 434 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 433, 1, 2, 958555) subjects and a violation of this rule leads to a conflict between the two: the subjects turn disloyal in secret and the Government ceases to trust anyone and becomes suspicious.
('16', 433, 1, 3, 958733) In disobeying an order of the Government, one thing must be remembered.
('16', 433, 1, 4, 958805) We cannot claim with certainty that the order in question is unjust; though we may think it so, it may in fact be just.
('16', 433, 1, 5, 958925) Therefore, as in private dealings, so a difference between a Government and its subjects should be settled through a panch.
('16', 433, 1, 6, 959049) This is what our ancient kings used to do.
('16', 433, 1, 7, 959092) The British Government always does so.
('16', 433, 1, 8, 959131) Such a panch is called a ‘commission’ or ‘committee’ and in order to save the prestige of the Government the recommendations of the panch are not made enforceable through a court but are left to the discretion of the former.
('16', 433, 1, 9, 959356) The ultimate result, though, is the same as in arbitration of the usual kind.
('16', 433, 1, 10, 959434) Government cannot be carried on without taking into account public opinion.
('16', 433, 1, 11, 959510) What should be done, then, if the Government refuses to appoint a committee or commission ?
('16', 433, 1, 12, 959602) A people amongst whom brute force is the sole arbiter resorts to violence and seeks justice with arms.
('16', 433, 1, 13, 959705) My own experience is that this method is futile.
('16', 433, 1, 14, 959754) I believe also that the scriptures of all religions have denounced this manner of obtaining justice through violence and we certainly do not employ it in our domestic affairs.
('16', 433, 1, 15, 959930) The straightforward course is to disobey the order and submit patiently and without anger to the consequent suffering.
('16', 433, 1, 16, 960049) This will serve many purposes.
('16', 433, 1, 17, 960080) If it turns out that we were in the wrong, the suffering we may have gone through would be justified; if are right, the other party, that is, the Government, cannot remain unmoved and ultimately it will have no option but to do justice.
('16', 433, 1, 18, 960317) This is vouched for by the scriptures; they assert truth to be ever victorious; and time and again we find it is.
('16', 433, 1, 19, 960431) The people of Kheda have come forward to suffer in this manner for the sake of truth, of dharma.
('16', 433, 2, 20, 960528) Lest we should become weak, we have bound ourselves by a pledge.
('16', 433, 2, 21, 960593) No people can ever rise without doing this.
('16', 433, 2, 22, 960637) A pledge means unshakable resolution.
('16', 433, 2, 23, 960675) The undecided man is swept from this side to that like a rudderless boat, and finally destroyed.
('16', 433, 2, 24, 960772) The Commissioner says that the pledge itself was improper and taken without thought.
('16', 433, 2, 25, 960857) That it was not improper, we saw earlier, inasmuch as we have the right to disobey what we believe to be an unjust order; and that it was not taken thoughtlessly, everyone who took it knows.
('16', 433, 2, 26, 961048) The course of the sun may alter, but this pledge, just and taken after full deliberation, shall not be abandoned.
('16', 434, 0, 1, 961162) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 435
('16', 434, 1, 2, 961208) I am sorry that Mr. Pratt has misrepresented the facts in his reference to the mill hands’ strike in Ahmedabad and has violated the dictates of courtesy, justice, propriety and friendship.
('16', 434, 1, 3, 961397) I hope that he has done so inadvertently.
('16', 434, 1, 4, 961439) If any people in this world have honoured their pledge, the mill workers of Ahmedabad have.
('16', 434, 1, 5, 961531) They had always maintained that they would be prepared to accept any wage that the arbitrators fixed.
('16', 434, 1, 6, 961633) It was because, at the time of the strike, the mill owners repudiated this principle that the mill hands demanded thirty five per cent.
('16', 434, 1, 7, 961769) Even afterwards, they did not refuse arbitration.
('16', 434, 1, 8, 961819) They secured thirty five per cent for the first day and so kept the letter of the pledge.
('16', 434, 1, 9, 961909) To decide what they should get afterwards, an arbitrator was appointed and the workers agreed to accept whatever he awarded.
('16', 434, 1, 10, 962034) Pending the award, the wages were fixed at between twenty per cent as offered by the mill owners and thirty five per cent as demanded by the workers.
('16', 434, 1, 11, 962184) Even for this intervening period, adjustments were to be made subsequently in accordance with the arbitrators’ award.
('16', 434, 1, 12, 962302) Thus the spirit of the pledge was kept.
('16', 434, 1, 13, 962342) However that may be, the mill hands certainly did not deliberately abandon their pledge, as alleged by Mr. Pratt.
('16', 434, 1, 14, 962456) He is free to believe that they did; he is his own master.
('16', 434, 1, 15, 962515) What is material is how the matter appeared to the workers; and this has been misrepresented by Mr. Pratt.
('16', 434, 1, 16, 962622) He was present when the terms of the agreement were being explained to the mill hands.
('16', 434, 1, 17, 962709) It was shown to them how the pledge could be considered to have been kept and the agreement was readily welcomed by the workers.
('16', 434, 1, 18, 962838) The gentleman was a witness to all this.
('16', 434, 1, 19, 962879) Speaking on the agreement.
('16', 434, 1, 20, 962906) he said:
('16', 434, 2, 21, 962915) I am happy that the two parties have arrived at a settlement.
('16', 434, 2, 22, 962977) So long as you seek and follow Mr. Gandhi’s advice, I am sure, you will succeed improving your lot and securing justice.
('16', 434, 2, 23, 963098) You must bear it in mind that Mr. Gandhi and the ladies and gentlemen who helped him have suffered a great deal for you, have put themselves to trouble and shown their love for you.
('16', 434, 3, 24, 963280) With what little intelligence I have, I fail to understand how, despite this, he talks of the pledge having been given the go by.
('16', 434, 4, 25, 963410) The Commissioner uttered many threats and even said that he would carry them out.
('16', 434, 4, 26, 963492) That means that he will confiscate the lands of all those who have taken this pledge and will even debar their heirs from owning lands in Kheda district.
('16', 435, 0, 1, 963646) 436 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 435, 1, 2, 963688) This is a very fearful, cruel and heartless threat.
('16', 435, 1, 3, 963740) I believe it issues from intense anger.
('16', 435, 1, 4, 963780) When the anger has subsided, he will feel sorry for having uttered such a cruel threat.
('16', 435, 1, 5, 963868) He holds the relationship between the Government and the people to be the same as between parents and children.
('16', 435, 1, 6, 963980) There is no instance in the whole history of the world of parents having disinherited their children for having resisted them in a non violent manner.
('16', 435, 1, 7, 964131) The pledge you have taken may be a mistaken one—that is not inconceivable—but there is not even a trace of discourtesy or insolence or defiance in it.
('16', 435, 1, 8, 964282) It is still inconceivable to me how punishment of this serious nature could be meted out for taking a pledge in a more or less religious spirit for one’s own uplift.
('16', 435, 1, 9, 964448) India cannot tolerate such punishment nor will the British statesmen ever uphold it.
('16', 435, 1, 10, 964533) The British public would be horrified at it.
('16', 435, 1, 11, 964578) If such fearful injustice should be perpetrated in the British Empire, I can live in it only as an outlaw.
('16', 435, 1, 12, 964685) But I have far greater faith in British statesmanship than the Commissioner has.
('16', 435, 1, 13, 964766) And I will repeat, what I said to you before, that I consider it impossible that you should lose your lands for anything done with such pure motives as yours.
('16', 435, 1, 14, 964925) Nevertheless, we too must be ready to lose our lands.
('16', 435, 1, 15, 964979) On the one hand, there is your pledge and, on the other, there is your property.
('16', 435, 1, 16, 965060) All that property—both movable and immovable— is nothing as compared to your pledge.
('16', 435, 1, 17, 965145) Your honouring the pledge will be a far more valuable legacy for your posterity than property worth lakhs of rupees.
('16', 435, 1, 18, 965262) This is a way by following which the whole of India can raise itself and I am sure you will never abandon it.
('16', 435, 1, 19, 965372) I pray to God that He may give you the strength to keep the pledge.

('16', 435, 5, 23, 965517) SATYAGRAHA CAMP, NADIAD, April 17, 1918
('16', 435, 6, 24, 965557) 1. The volunteers must remember that, as this is a satyagraha campaign, they must abide by truth under all circumstances.
('16', 435, 7, 25, 965679) 2. In satyagraha, there can be no room for rancour; which means that a satyagrahi should utter no harsh word about anyone, from a ravania

('16', 436, 1, 2, 965863) to the Governor himself; if someone does so, it is the volunteer’s duty to stop him.
('16', 436, 2, 3, 965948) 3. Rudeness has no place in satyagraha.
('16', 436, 2, 4, 965988) Perfect courtesy must be shown even to those who may look upon us as their enemies and the villagers must be taught to do the same.
('16', 436, 2, 5, 966120) Rudeness may harm our cause and the struggle may be unduly prolonged.
('16', 436, 2, 6, 966190) The volunteers should give the most serious attention to this matter and think out in their minds as many examples as possible of the advantages accruing from courtesy and the disadvantages resulting from rudeness and explain them to the people.
('16', 436, 3, 7, 966436) 4. The volunteers must remember that this is a holy war.
('16', 436, 3, 8, 966493) We embarked upon it because, had we not, we would have failed in our dharma.
('16', 436, 3, 9, 966570) And so all the rules which are essential for living a religious life must be observed here too.
('16', 436, 3, 10, 966666) 5. We are opposing the intoxication of power, that is, the blind application of law, and not authority as such.
('16', 436, 3, 11, 966778) The difference must never be lost sight of.
('16', 436, 3, 12, 966822) It is, therefore, our duty to help the officers in their other work.
('16', 436, 3, 13, 966891) 6. We are to apply here the same principle that we follow in a domestic quarrel.
('16', 436, 3, 14, 966972) We should think of the Government and the people as constituting a large family and act accordingly.
('16', 436, 3, 15, 967073) 7. We are not to boycott or treat with scorn those who hold different views from ours.
('16', 436, 3, 16, 967160) It must be our resolve to win them over by courteous behaviour.
('16', 436, 3, 17, 967224) 8. We must not try to be clever.
('16', 436, 3, 18, 967257) We must always be frank and straightforward.
('16', 436, 3, 19, 967302) 9. When they stay in villages, the volunteers should demand the fewest services from the village folk.
('16', 436, 3, 20, 967405) Wherever it is possible to reach a place on foot, they should avoid using a vehicle.
('16', 436, 3, 21, 967490) We must insist on being served the simplest food.
('16', 436, 3, 22, 967540) Restraining them from preparing dainties will add grace to the service we render.
('16', 436, 3, 23, 967622) 10. As they move about in villages, the volunteers should observe the economic condition of the people and the deficiencies in their education and try, in their spare time, to make them good.
('16', 436, 3, 24, 967814) 11. If they can, they should create opportunities when they may teach the village children.
('16', 436, 3, 25, 967906) 12. If they notice any violation of the rules of good health, they should draw the villagers’ attention to the fact.
('16', 437, 0, 1, 968023) 438 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 437, 1, 2, 968065) 13. If, at any place, they find people engaged in quarrelling among themselves, the volunteers should try to save them from their quarrels.
('16', 437, 1, 3, 968205) 14. They should read out to the people, when the latter are free, books which promote satyagraha.
('16', 437, 1, 4, 968303) They may read out stories of Prahlad, Harishchandra and others.
('16', 437, 1, 5, 968367) The people should also be made familiar with instances of pure satyagraha to be found in the West and in Islamic literature.
('16', 437, 1, 6, 968492) 15. At no time and under no circumstances is the use of arms permitted in satyagraha.
('16', 437, 1, 7, 968578) It should never be forgotten that in this struggle the highest type of non violence is to be maintained.
('16', 437, 1, 8, 968683) Satyagraha means fighting oppression through voluntary suffering.
('16', 437, 1, 9, 968749) There can be no question here of making anyone else suffer.
('16', 437, 1, 10, 968809) Satyagraha is always successful; it can never meet with defeat: let every volunteer understand this himself and then explain it to the people.

('16', 437, 4, 13, 969038) AS AT SABARMATI, April 17 [1918]
('16', 437, 5, 14, 969071) MY DEAR WEST, I am writing this at a little village where I have arrived with Mrs. Gandhi and others to preach passive resistance.
('16', 437, 5, 15, 969202) Here is the cutting.
('16', 437, 6, 16, 969223) The fight is great but it taxes me to the utmost I will not discuss your latest letter; I simply want to say, “Do what you like.
('16', 437, 6, 17, 969352) Phoenix and all it means are just as much yours as mine.
('16', 437, 6, 18, 969409) You are on the spot.
('16', 437, 6, 19, 969430) You must do what you think best.
('16', 437, 6, 20, 969463) I can but advise.” You are right; my views about the vernaculars must have coloured my view about Indian Opinion.
('16', 437, 6, 21, 969577) I do want it to appear in English, but I feel that if it could not be published in English it could at least be published in Gujarati.
('16', 437, 6, 22, 969712) Perhaps you would have me say the reverse.
('16', 437, 6, 23, 969755) It is enough for me to know that you are on the spot.
('16', 437, 6, 24, 969809) My affection for you and trust in you remain undiminished.
('16', 437, 6, 25, 969868) I recall many more of the touching conversations we had in Joubert Park and
('16', 437, 7, 26, 969944) 1 There is no clue as to what this was.

('16', 438, 1, 3, 970041) Then the question of I.O. being published in English at the very least.
('16', 438, 1, 4, 970113) I was not at all nervous when I received your letter enclosing Manilal’s letter.
('16', 438, 1, 5, 970194) I knew you would keep calm and take a perfectly philosophic view of the whole thing.
('16', 438, 1, 6, 970279) I shall keenly watch the progress of your new and bold experiments.
('16', 438, 1, 7, 970347) Please give my love to Granny & Mrs. West.
('16', 438, 1, 8, 970390) I wonder how Sam has taken all this.
('16', 438, 1, 9, 970427) Please ask him to write to me.

('16', 438, 6, 14, 970590) April 17, 1918
('16', 438, 7, 15, 970605) We are carrying on this struggle to secure justice from the Government.
('16', 438, 7, 16, 970677) Whilst coming here, I observed people using goads to urge bullocks yoked to carts or ploughs.
('16', 438, 7, 17, 970771) This cruelty is unforgivable in us, especially as we claim to be protectors of cows.
('16', 438, 7, 18, 970856) To save the cow we engage in big fights with Muslims, but we do not hesitate to apply goads to bullocks.
('16', 438, 7, 19, 970961) It is for sins such as these that we have to suffer.
('16', 438, 7, 20, 971014) I trust the use of goads will disappear from now.
('16', 438, 7, 21, 971064) When, driving here in a bullock cart from Petlad station, I saw the bullocks being pricked with a goad, I felt that refraining from wearing shoes yet driving in a cart was a far greater sin than wearing shoes.
('16', 438, 7, 22, 971274) I am here today not to talk about kindness to animals but about justice; all the same, believing that we must do justice to others if we want justice for ourselves, I took the occasion to say all this.
('16', 438, 7, 23, 971476) It is not so very difficult to pay the land revenue to the Government.
('16', 438, 7, 24, 971547) One can borrow the money from someone or some land or a buffalo and pay up.
('16', 438, 7, 25, 971623) Then why take upon ourselves all this bother of not paying and allowing our goods and lands to be confiscated?
('16', 438, 7, 26, 971734) This is howthe wise ones advise us.
('16', 438, 7, 27, 971770) I have given my answer to this at many places.
('16', 438, 7, 28, 971817) The question is one of principle, not merely of paying the land revenue.
('16', 438, 7, 29, 971890) We pay because we are afraid of the Government; it is this fear we wish to get rid of.
('16', 438, 7, 30, 971977) The gist of all that the Commissioner said was this: that the people must not disobey the Government’s order.
('16', 438, 7, 31, 972087) The idea I want to put into you, on the contrary, is that there is no disloyalty in
('16', 439, 0, 1, 972171) 440 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 439, 1, 2, 972213) disobeying an unjust order of the Government; rather, it is the purest loyalty to do so.
('16', 439, 1, 3, 972302) To submit to an unjust order without even a protest is a sign of weakness; it is sheer cowardice.
('16', 439, 1, 4, 972400) For instance, even in our domestic life, a son or a daughter, suffering injustice at the hands of parents, has the right to resist; we want to apply the same rule to our dealings with the Government.
('16', 439, 1, 5, 972600) We do not oppose the Government to bring it down or seek anything from it through unfair means.
('16', 439, 1, 6, 972696) We seek justice through self suffering.
('16', 439, 1, 7, 972736) Till today, we suffered out of fear and timidity and now we wish to suffer on purpose.
('16', 439, 1, 8, 972823) The Government is entitled to test us.
('16', 439, 1, 9, 972862) You friends, men and women, have been playing a game with the Government; but, when the Government starts confiscating your lands, it will be seen how many of you can hold out.
('16', 439, 1, 10, 973039) When it has done its worst by way of repression and sees that you will not bend despite it all, it will climb down all too readily....
('16', 439, 1, 11, 973174) 1 When the people tell their Government with one voice that they will not submit to its unjust orders, the latter is bound to yield.
('16', 439, 1, 12, 973307) This has ever been so.
('16', 439, 1, 13, 973330) It is our duty to be loyal to the Government, What difficulty can there be for a people so loyal in obtaining justice from the British Government?
('16', 439, 1, 14, 973477) That is why I tell you to remain determined till the very end and not to lose heart.
('16', 439, 2, 15, 973562) It is desirable that you should all understand the full meaning of satyagraha.
('16', 439, 2, 16, 973641) Four days ago, I met Mr. Carmichael in Bombay.
('16', 439, 2, 17, 973688) He is the head of the Revenue Department.
('16', 439, 2, 18, 973730) In the course of our conversation, he asked me to consider whether this struggle would ultimately raise or lower the people morally, will teach them respect for law or contempt for it.
('16', 439, 2, 19, 973915) I told him that there was no fear of their moral sense or loyalty being weakened.
('16', 439, 2, 20, 973997) In satyagraha, people cannot but gain in moral strength and learn to be more courteous.
('16', 439, 2, 21, 974085) If we were to suffer moral harm, our struggle would not be satyagraha but duragraha.
('16', 439, 2, 22, 974170) Our crops have been in most places less than four annas and, in some villages, less than six annas.
('16', 439, 2, 23, 974270) That being so, according to the Revenue Code, the collection of revenue should be suspended to the extent of half the amount.
('16', 439, 2, 24, 974396) This is all our demand, one which we claim as our right.
('16', 439, 2, 25, 974453) Accordingly, we requested the Government to order the suspension.
('16', 439, 2, 26, 974519) It did not accept our assessment of the crops.
('16', 439, 2, 27, 974566) Thereupon, we asked the appointment of a committee of inquiry.
('16', 439, 2, 28, 974629) We assured the Government that, if it were proved correct, we would accept the officers’ assessment of the crops.
('16', 439, 2, 29, 974743) Even then, the

('16', 440, 0, 1, 974791) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 441
('16', 440, 1, 2, 974837) Government refused to appoint a committee.
('16', 440, 1, 3, 974880) Under these circumstances, we should not pay the assessment.
('16', 440, 1, 4, 974941) If we fail, in this struggle, to get our rights recognized by the Government, we shall never be able again to lift our heads.
('16', 440, 1, 5, 975067) I notice that your big two storeyed houses are in a dilapidated condition; the reason for this is that you have not the money with which to carry out the necessary repairs.
('16', 440, 1, 6, 975240) From this I can see that the people are impoverished.
('16', 440, 1, 7, 975294) Bad years are a part of our lot; cloth and food are enormously dear; diseases are so rampant that, even when there is no war, people die before their time.
('16', 440, 1, 8, 975450) Having regard to the times, I have advised the people of Kheda district, who value their self respects to secure justice by submitting voluntarily to injustice and oppression.
('16', 440, 1, 9, 975626) We can secure it not through insolence but manliness.
('16', 440, 1, 10, 975680) Our struggle is so straightforward that it is bound to increase our moral strength.
('16', 440, 1, 11, 975764) I advise you emphatically, therefore, not to forsake truth on any account.
('16', 440, 1, 12, 975839) Anyone who has but a glimpse of the truth, will, in every step he takes, follow truth and morality.
('16', 440, 1, 13, 975939) Make courtesy and truth a part of your life.
('16', 440, 1, 14, 975984) Caught in a big fire, let us all unite and fight the Government.
('16', 440, 1, 15, 976049) This is a fine opportunity for us to work for our uplift.
('16', 440, 1, 16, 976107) I repeat to all friends: “Remain steadfast.” To the ladies, I say: “Give courage to your husbands, brothers, sons.”

('16', 440, 4, 19, 976281) April 17, 1918
('16', 440, 5, 20, 976296) I had hoped to meet you all last week, but I went to Ahmedabad to see the Commissioner and then I had to go to Bombay to meet his superior, Mr. Carmichael.
('16', 440, 5, 21, 976452) I could not, therefore, come earlier as I had hoped to.
('16', 440, 5, 22, 976508) If Vallabhbhai and I have come here to Chikhodra and the neighbouring villages, where reigns the order of Dayanand Saraswati, it is not, certainly, to give you encouragement but to receive it ourselves from you, or, if I may say so, not to kindle fire in you but to receive some of that divine light from you.
('16', 440, 5, 23, 976818) I am sure you will prove me right by holding out in this struggle till the very last.
('16', 440, 5, 24, 976904) Dayanand Saraswati is among the foremost of the great spiritual teachers India has produced in the past.
('16', 440, 5, 25, 977009) I hope that this and the surrounding villages, following as they do this great teacher, will
('16', 441, 0, 1, 977102) 442 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 441, 1, 2, 977144) resound with holy chants some the Vedas and also live their life as enjoined by the Vedas.
('16', 441, 1, 3, 977235) I hope, moreover, that they will observe the disciplines of yama 1 niyama 2 and rigorously keep the vow of swadeshi as well.
('16', 441, 1, 4, 977360) It would pain me very much to learn that the people of Chikhodra do not wear locally produced cloth, but use other foreign or mill made cloth.
('16', 441, 1, 5, 977503) I am taken aback as I see the clothes of many of you here.
('16', 441, 1, 6, 977562) I see that the cloth is mill made, either foreign or Indian.
('16', 441, 1, 7, 977623) To my mind, mill made cloth is seventy five per cent foreign.
('16', 441, 1, 8, 977685) The machinery on which the cloth is woven is foreign and all its benefit goes to foreign workers.
('16', 441, 1, 9, 977783) Those who wear mill made cloth may have this satisfaction that the money they pay for its manufacture will go to our mill hands.
('16', 441, 1, 10, 977912) But hardly anyone stops to consider that these mill hands, leaving their agriculture, give up a fine profession and a simple life to join the mills.
('16', 441, 1, 11, 978061) It is my advice, therefore, that you, in this and the surrounding villages, where Dayanand Saraswati’s order holds sway, should use your own cloth and so keep the rule of non possession and that of non violence, for both these are included in the law of swadeshi.
('16', 441, 1, 12, 978325) This latter holds within itself the basic principles of satyagraha.
('16', 441, 1, 13, 978393) Having explained them in brief, I proceed to the main subject.
('16', 441, 1, 14, 978456) In employing satyagraha against the injustice done by the Government, adherence to truth and non violence is very necessary.
('16', 441, 1, 15, 978581) Where the crops have been less than six annas, collection of half the revenue should be suspended, as provided in the rules framed by the Government.
('16', 441, 1, 16, 978731) It refuses to abide by this rule and tells you in these harsh and bitter words: “Nothing will avail you in this; you will rather stand to lose.
('16', 441, 1, 17, 978875) Nor can the people have any say on the Revenue Code.” The Government argues that we cannot take any matter arising out of it to the High Court or any other court, but that the people should petition the Collector, approach the Commissioner in the event of the Collector turning down their petition, and, if the latter refuses to intervene, they may go right up to the Governor.
('16', 441, 1, 18, 979253) In the present case, however, the Commissioner has spared no threats; not stopping at this, he had a letter of the Governor’s brought to the meeting and went to the length of saying that whatever he did would be upheld by the Governor.
('16', 441, 1, 19, 979489) I have never seen or heard of such
('16', 441, 2, 20, 979524) 1 Any moral duty or religious observance; the yamas are usually said to be ten, but their names are given differently by deterrent writers.
('16', 441, 2, 21, 979664) They include celibacy; compassion, truth; charity, non violence, etc.
('16', 441, 2, 22, 979734) 2 Any voluntary or self imposed religious observance, dependent on external conditions
('16', 442, 0, 1, 979821) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 443
('16', 442, 1, 2, 979867) unlimited authority in the hands of one single officer anywhere.
('16', 442, 1, 3, 979932) Our kings sometimes used to oppress the subjects and rob them of their possessions, but I cannot believe that such a thing can happen under British rule.
('16', 442, 1, 4, 980086) If, keeping within the limits of the law, we decide not to pay the land revenue, there is no disloyalty to the Government.
('16', 442, 1, 5, 980209) Most respectfully we accept the law and want the Government officers also to be governed by it, I would advise you to let your lands be confiscated, even if they be worth not three million but three hundred million.
('16', 442, 1, 6, 980425) Ours is a fight in the way of satyagraha and we must fight it with the purest soul force.
('16', 442, 1, 7, 980515) Its secret lies in bearing anything that may be inflicted on us.
('16', 442, 1, 8, 980580) This implies the observance of perfect non violence; and hence it is that we have called it a holy fight.
('16', 442, 1, 9, 980686) We want to win, not by striking terror in the rulers, but by awakening their sense of justice.
('16', 442, 1, 10, 980781) We are guilty of no treason in doing so nor do we thereby prove ourselves enemies of religion.
('16', 442, 1, 11, 980876) Our struggle is based on truth and we claim justice from the Government on humanitarian, religious and ethical grounds.
('16', 442, 1, 12, 980996) Our action is thus: altogether unexceptionable.
('16', 442, 1, 13, 981044) I have faith in you, men and women of Chikhodra, that you will understand the principles of satyagraha aright and follow them.
('16', 442, 1, 14, 981171) There is no remedy like satyagraha to see an end to your suffering.
('16', 442, 1, 15, 981239) If you use it, you will discover that it alone is the right remedy against our present grievances and those to come.
('16', 442, 1, 16, 981356) You should hold out till the last in the fight on which you have embarked.
('16', 442, 1, 17, 981431) If you fail to do so, you will have betrayed your religion and the consequences for India will be unhappy.
('16', 442, 1, 18, 981538) This struggle will make it clear to the administration here in Kheda district that it cannot ruin by ignoring popular opinion; that only by respecting public opinion can it maintain itself.
('16', 442, 1, 19, 981728) This is the real aim behind our struggle and it is for you to see that it is attained.
('16', 442, 1, 20, 981815) You have taken the pledge to uphold truth.
('16', 442, 1, 21, 981858) If you read the Ramayana, you will realize what value to attach to one’s word.
('16', 442, 1, 22, 981937) Abiding by one’s word, one may achieve moksha.
('16', 442, 1, 23, 981984) Be loyal to your pledge, no matter how much you suffer, no matter even if the universe should be blown up.
('16', 442, 1, 24, 982091) To the ladies, I shall say only this: “Even if you have to part with your furniture and other household things, your cattle and your land, do not despair.
('16', 442, 1, 25, 982246) Help the men in your families to honour their pledge.
('16', 442, 1, 26, 982300) May God give you the wisdom to be loyal to that pledge.”

('16', 443, 2, 3, 982453) April 18, 1918
('16', 443, 3, 4, 982468) Last week Vallabhbhai and I were to be here, but I had to go to Bombay and Ahmedabad and could not come.
('16', 443, 3, 5, 982573) I apologize to you for this.
('16', 443, 3, 6, 982602) Owing to the heat today, I casually asked how far the venue of the meeting was.
('16', 443, 3, 7, 982682) I was informed that it was close by, so I decided to walk down.
('16', 443, 3, 8, 982746) However, my young friends saw to it that I did not feel the heat.
('16', 443, 3, 9, 982812) To be sure, that bespeaks their love for me.
('16', 443, 3, 10, 982857) Their kind turn also suggests that the advice I have been giving has appealed to you all.
('16', 443, 3, 11, 982947) You know, however, that my advice will let neither you nor me sleep soundly, nor will it permit any rest to my co workers.
('16', 443, 3, 12, 983070) It can mean only suffering, sleepless nights and running from village to village.
('16', 443, 3, 13, 983152) You should let your buffaloes be seized, your jewellery taken away and your lands confiscated.
('16', 443, 3, 14, 983247) It is because you believe that I advise you for your good that you shower so much love on me.
('16', 443, 3, 15, 983341) I am very happy at this, but I am also fully aware, at the same time, what responsibility rests on me and how it increases as the fight intensifies.
('16', 443, 3, 16, 983490) Despite the complexity and the seriousness of the problem, I do not feel even in the inmost depth of my heart that I should withdraw this advice.
('16', 443, 3, 17, 983636) As days pass and the struggle assumes its real form, I feel that, had I not given the advice I did to the people of Kheda district, I would have failed in my duty to Gujarat.
('16', 443, 3, 18, 983811) Had I not given this advice, my trying to serve society and the country, while comfortably settled here in Gujarat, would have made me always feel that my dedication was imperfect in that measure.
('16', 443, 3, 19, 984008) The advice I have given in the present situation will raise the moral standards of men and women.
('16', 443, 3, 20, 984106) Simultaneously, the people of Kheda will come up and their triumph will be proclaimed all over India.
('16', 443, 3, 21, 984208) Looking at the matter from another point of view, the Govern ment has made it a policy not to consult the people or respect their opinions at all.
('16', 443, 3, 22, 984355) This is our experience in legislatures, municipalities and other public institutions and that is so because they do not have the backing of public opinion behind them.
('16', 443, 3, 23, 984523) 2 When we are afraid of
('16', 443, 4, 24, 984547) 1 A Village in Borsad taluka; the meeting was largely attended by agriculturists from the surrounding villages.
('16', 443, 4, 25, 984659) 2 Reports in The Bombay Chronicle, 22 4 1918, and New India, 24 4 1918, quote words to the same effect, but have in addition the sentence, “We have got no scope there to assert our opinions.”

('16', 444, 1, 3, 985026) We dare not utter a single word before him.
('16', 444, 1, 4, 985070) This condition is worse even than that of the animals.
('16', 444, 1, 5, 985125) These, when they have had enough of beating, obstinately refuse to move or do our will.
('16', 444, 1, 6, 985213) In comparison with them, consider what sort of condition ours is.
('16', 444, 1, 7, 985279) If, therefore, we would give proof of our being men, we must shed fear; if we do, we shall win in this struggle.
('16', 444, 1, 8, 985392) In the same way that in Mr. Pratt’s meeting at Nadiad the farmers replied to him boldly, we should cultivate sufficient courage to place the facts even before the Governor.
('16', 444, 1, 9, 985565) We shall not be insolent in our fight; we desire to fight by means of soul force, to win through self suffering.
('16', 444, 1, 10, 985678) This is a divine, immutable law; our scriptures declare that, if we would have happiness, we must go through suffering, do tapascharya.
('16', 444, 1, 11, 985814) King Dasharatha did so, to get sons like Bharata, Rama, Lakshmana and Shatrughna.
('16', 444, 1, 12, 985896) And so did King Nala, too, for the sake of truth and self respect, bearing countless afflictions.
('16', 444, 1, 13, 985994) That is the reason why at early dawn we remind ourselves of these ever memorable holy souls.
('16', 444, 1, 14, 986087) These divine tales are a part of our heritage....
('16', 444, 1, 15, 986137) 1 By suffering voluntarily, we seek through truth and non violence to end our sufferings ....
('16', 444, 1, 16, 986231) 2 The people of Kheda district have taken upon themselves to demonstrate this principle to the world.
('16', 444, 1, 17, 986333) It is a principle which will be of great service to the world .
('16', 444, 1, 18, 986397) 3 Our crop has been less than four annas; and so, according to the Revenue Code, the Government should have suspended the assessment this year.
('16', 444, 1, 19, 986541) Mr. Pratt argues that our figures are incorrect and wants to enforce the collection.
('16', 444, 1, 20, 986626) We insist that what we say is one hundred per cent true, that it is the Government’s figures which are incorrect, and that, accordingly, the Government should suspend the assessment.
('16', 444, 1, 21, 986809) There is, thus, an element of petty self interest in this struggle.
('16', 444, 1, 22, 986877) But it also involves a far more important issue than this, namely, that the Government should learn to respect public opinion.
('16', 444, 1, 23, 987004) As a result of this struggle, it may come about that land revenue is remitted and people may become conscious of their strength; that will be no small gain.
('16', 444, 1, 24, 987161) We must, therefore, suffer and be loyal to our pledge.
('16', 444, 1, 25, 987216) We did not resolve on it without thinking.
('16', 444, 1, 26, 987259) We ventured on the task only after the fullest deliberation.
('16', 444, 1, 27, 987320) A pledge taken with the purest of motives and for the good of the people can never be betrayed though the sun may rise in the west instead of in the east.
('16', 444, 1, 28, 987475) I entreat you to cling to it.
('16', 444, 1, 29, 987505) This is my humble advice.

('16', 445, 4, 9, 988002) If however you think that I may not make use of what was a purely friendly interview I shall entirely respect your wish.
('16', 445, 4, 10, 988123) I merely thought of making use of it as we discussed large principles and found we had honest but insurmountable difference of opinion.
('16', 445, 5, 11, 988259) Yours sincerely,

('16', 445, 9, 15, 988379) [NADIAD,] April 19, 1918
('16', 445, 10, 16, 988404) I was delighted to receive your letter signed by so many of you.
('16', 445, 10, 17, 988469) I shall send you a teacher as fast as I can.
('16', 445, 10, 18, 988514) I am trying to secure the services of a volunteer who would teach Hindi for the love of it.
('16', 445, 10, 19, 988606) The success of this great national effort depends almost entirely upon the action of the Presidency of Madras.
('16', 445, 10, 20, 988717) But I have great faith in the Tamil brethren rising to the occasion.
('16', 445, 10, 21, 988786) There will be no limit to our power for serving the land as soon as we make Hindi the common medium of expression throughout the length and breadth of India.

('16', 446, 1, 2, 989201) 306. SPEECH AT KASAR 1
('16', 446, 2, 3, 989224) April 20, 1918
('16', 446, 3, 4, 989239) 1 do not wish to speak much here.
('16', 446, 3, 5, 989273) I have informed myself about the condition in the village.
('16', 446, 3, 6, 989332) Where there is unity and firmness among the people, things are bound to be happy.
('16', 446, 3, 7, 989414) Chothai notices have been served on you, your buffaloes have been seized and your jewellery taken away.
('16', 446, 3, 8, 989518) We have borne all this.
('16', 446, 3, 9, 989542) Now, we are threatened with confiscation of lands.
('16', 446, 3, 10, 989593) Never forget that the respect we enjoy in society will be safe, and so also our lands, only if we keep our pledge.
('16', 446, 3, 11, 989708) The latter cannot take precedence over the former.
('16', 446, 3, 12, 989759) If all of you are ready to fight it out with the Government, we shall see what the Government gains by taking over our lands.
('16', 446, 3, 13, 989885) In Nayaka, one hundred and seventy eight bighas of land have been confiscated; but I do not believe that land has been confiscated because it is entered so in the register.
('16', 446, 3, 14, 990058) The Government does not intend to enclose the lands with walls, so that we may not be able to reach them, nor will it be able to do anything of the sort in this satyagraha struggle.
('16', 446, 3, 15, 990240) Hold out tenaciously, therefore; so you will bring glory to yourselves and to India.
('16', 446, 3, 16, 990325) If you yield, agriculturists all over India will be demoralized.
('16', 446, 3, 17, 990390) Bear in mind another thing.
('16', 446, 3, 18, 990418) Those who have recourse to satyagraha must not be overbearing in their conduct towards others.
('16', 446, 3, 19, 990513) This is an immutable truth, of universal range like the far spread rays of the sun.
('16', 446, 3, 20, 990597) Just as we tell the Government not to use its power as a goad with which to drive us, so also you in your turn must deal out perfect justice to people of all the communities in your town or village.

('16', 446, 5, 23, 990853) April 20, 1918
('16', 446, 6, 24, 990868) I came to your village once before but, yielding to your pressure, we have all come here again.
('16', 446, 6, 25, 990964) The teacher here sent me a report of the interesting discussion that the people had with the mamlatdar and wanted some clarifications.
('16', 446, 6, 26, 991099) That is the reason for our
('16', 446, 7, 27, 991126) 1 Along with Kasturba, Manu Subedar, Vallabhabhai Patel and others, Gandhiji visited Kasar, Ajarpura and Samarkha in the Anand taluka on April 20 and addressed meetings of peasants.
('16', 447, 0, 1, 991308) 448 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 447, 1, 2, 991350) being here again.
('16', 447, 2, 3, 991368) First of all, I shall say something about the arguments of the mamlatdar.
('16', 447, 2, 4, 991442) He told you that you should keep the terms under which your ancestors acquired the lands from the Government.
('16', 447, 2, 5, 991552) Let us consider what these terms are likely to have been.
('16', 447, 3, 6, 991610) They could not have been what the mamlatdar said they were.
('16', 447, 3, 7, 991670) The Government passes laws which serve its own convenience and, though they do not serve ours, we submit to them.
('16', 447, 3, 8, 991784) For instance, we submit to the Revenue Code though we are not very happy with it.
('16', 447, 3, 9, 991866) What was the practice in olden days?
('16', 447, 3, 10, 991903) It was that the Government was paid chothai; in other words, it claimed one fourth of the yield, if there was any, but nothing if there was none.
('16', 447, 3, 11, 992049) This was our old system.
('16', 447, 3, 12, 992074) The present Government believed that the laws it has passed have been for the benefit of the people.
('16', 447, 3, 13, 992175) Instead of claiming a share of the produce, this Government introduced the system of collecting the Land revenue in cash.
('16', 447, 3, 14, 992297) I do not believe that any advantage has accrued to the people by this law of the Government.
('16', 447, 3, 15, 992390) One of the provisions in the Land Revenue Code is to the effect that, if the crops are less than four annas, collection of the assessment should be suspended.
('16', 447, 3, 16, 992549) But the officers argue that it is in the discretion of the Government whether or not to order such suspension and that it may use the discretion only if it so chooses.
('16', 447, 3, 17, 992717) This is naked injustice.
('16', 447, 3, 18, 992742) Governments can maintain their authority only in one way, and that is by respecting public opinion.
('16', 447, 4, 19, 992842) Our struggle is not merely for securing suspension of the land revenue; a struggle for such relief would be a petty affair.
('16', 447, 4, 20, 992966) In truth, we are fighting for the sake of the important issue which is involved in it.
('16', 447, 4, 21, 993053) That is the issue of democracy, of the revival of democratic Government.
('16', 447, 4, 22, 993126) The people have awakened and begun to understand their rights.
('16', 447, 4, 23, 993189) A full understanding of these rights is what is meant by swaraj.
('16', 447, 4, 24, 993254) Let us water the seeds of the fundamental issues involved in this struggle, and they will produce sweet fruits for posterity, as sweet as the pleasant shade of this banyan tree.
('16', 447, 4, 25, 993432) That is the aim this struggle has set before itself.
('16', 447, 4, 26, 993485) Let the Government ridicule us; but you must realize that this struggle is not for securing a little relief in terms of money, it is in the nature of a foundation for a future democratic structure.
('16', 447, 5, 27, 993683) The people will be ruined if they let go their rights out of weakness.
('16', 447, 5, 28, 993754) Sir William Wedderburn, an ardent and sympathetic friend of the Indian people used to say all his life that, as the village
('16', 448, 0, 1, 993878) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 449
('16', 448, 1, 2, 993924) panchayats gradually disappeared, along with them was lost the key to swaraj.
('16', 448, 1, 3, 994002) These panchayats cannot be revived by writing books.
('16', 448, 1, 4, 994055) If, in every village, the people learn how to manage their affairs, the true key to swaraj will have been found.
('16', 448, 1, 5, 994168) A satyagraha struggle is an all embracing affair.
('16', 448, 1, 6, 994218) Truth is the very basis which sustains our life.
('16', 448, 1, 7, 994267) If they come with an order of attachment and you have nothing with you, tell them so; if you have anything, but do not wish to surrender it, let them know that plainly.
('16', 448, 1, 8, 994436) If you would not give provisions to Government servants, you should refuse them straight, but you may not truly say that you have no grain and therefore cannot supply the provisions they need.
('16', 448, 1, 9, 994629) A satyagrahi must speak the truth on every occasion.
('16', 448, 1, 10, 994682) You should understand clearly the principles of satyagraha and be guided by truth and other rules of moral conduct all your life.
('16', 448, 1, 11, 994812) Truth is God.
('16', 448, 1, 12, 994826) Let your jewellery and your lands be taken from you, but do not betray your dharma.
('16', 448, 1, 13, 994910) I pray God to give you strength to abide by the pledge you have taken.
('16', 448, 1, 14, 994981) In the revival of this way of dharma lies the key to swaraj.

('16', 448, 3, 17, 995098) April 22, 1918
('16', 448, 4, 18, 995113) In our daily living two weaknesses are evident.
('16', 448, 4, 19, 995161) The first is that we do all our work superficially; and the second is that whatever we take in hand, we do it without any understanding of it.
('16', 448, 4, 20, 995304) We do our work like the actors on a stage who speak out what they have learnt by rote.
('16', 448, 4, 21, 995391) Consequently we do not get the results we expect.
('16', 448, 4, 22, 995441) In our daily dealings, we are like the actor playing Harishchandra, whom we cannot expect to be permeated with truth in every pore of his skin.
('16', 448, 4, 23, 995585) This is exactly what these girls have proved by their manner of singing Vandemataram.
('16', 448, 4, 24, 995671) We have got into the habit of doing our work anyhow; so long as we do not put our whole heart into our work, we shall not succeed.
('16', 448, 5, 25, 995802) Our ancestors knew this and that is why they laid special stress on the correct pronunciation of the mantras.
('16', 448, 5, 26, 995912) Any error they counted as a sin.
('16', 448, 5, 27, 995945) You asked the girls to sing a grand national song like
('16', 448, 6, 28, 996000) 1 This was on the occasion of a visit by Gandhiji and his party to Palaj, in the Borsad taluka; over a thousand cultivators listened to Gandhiji’s address.
('16', 449, 0, 1, 996156) 450 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 449, 1, 2, 996198) Vandemataram.
('16', 449, 1, 3, 996212) We do not know in full the greatness of the song, its resonance and its tune.
('16', 449, 1, 4, 996290) That is the feeling I have about this struggle, that we are fighting it half heartedly.
('16', 449, 1, 5, 996378) If that is really so, if we have failed to understand its true import, then like the singing of these girls it will be unavailing.
('16', 449, 1, 6, 996509) I make these harsh remarks that you may all sit up and be more careful in this struggle.
('16', 449, 2, 7, 996598) The second point I wish to make is that we should carry on this struggle with a full understanding of it.
('16', 449, 2, 8, 996704) Mr. Pratt asked me once whether the people really understand what I have been doing.
('16', 449, 2, 9, 996789) If they fail to do so [he said] the results cannot but be evil.
('16', 449, 2, 10, 996853) In such a holy struggle we ought not to work half heartedly.
('16', 449, 2, 11, 996914) We are afraid of even petty officials.
('16', 449, 2, 12, 996953) This should not be so.
('16', 449, 2, 13, 996976) I keep telling you again and again that, even if we are to meet big and distinguished persons, we need not feel worried.
('16', 449, 2, 14, 997097) We have only to make up our mind not to be awed by them and to be courteous in addressing them.
('16', 449, 2, 15, 997193) If there is a difference of opinion, we should put it in proper language.
('16', 449, 2, 16, 997267) If we get over these shortcomings in our struggle, we should never have to suffer defeat.
('16', 449, 2, 17, 997357) We must take care that we never act thoughtlessly in this struggle.
('16', 449, 2, 18, 997425) Nor should fear have any place in it.
('16', 449, 2, 19, 997463) Truth suffers no harm.
('16', 449, 2, 20, 997486) You must repeat this at every step.
('16', 449, 3, 21, 997522) Vallabhbhai told me that the mamlatdar was encamped in this village for four days but had had no success.
('16', 449, 3, 22, 997628) The farmers remained firm.
('16', 449, 3, 23, 997655) You have shown this courage and I have nothing more to say.
('16', 449, 3, 24, 997715) I just told you that I was going to Delhi.
('16', 449, 3, 25, 997758) I don’t like to be away from this district, but I have to go to Delhi in connection with this struggle.
('16', 449, 3, 26, 997862) The Viceroy is to hold a conference.
('16', 449, 3, 27, 997899) It will consider how we can render more help in the great war that is being fought in Europe.
('16', 449, 3, 28, 997993) Perhaps the question of conscription will also come up for discussion.
('16', 449, 3, 29, 998064) We shall also be advised to put aside all our quarrels with the Government.
('16', 449, 3, 30, 998140) But this quarrel is not of our seeking, it has been thrust upon us.
('16', 449, 3, 31, 998208) I will tell them the same thing, that we did not invite this struggle, that it had been forced upon us.
('16', 449, 3, 32, 998312) When can I say this to the Viceroy?
('16', 449, 3, 33, 998348) Only if you are firm and true satyagrahis.
('16', 449, 4, 34, 998391) We can never lose.
('16', 449, 4, 35, 998410) It is impossible that they will confiscate our lands, for we have not committed the least offence.
('16', 449, 4, 36, 998509) Who can ever stop the person who follows the path of truth?
('16', 449, 4, 37, 998569) Even if your lands should be confiscated, have no fear and do not budge.
('16', 449, 4, 38, 998642) We are determined to get them back by taking to the ways of outlaws, if need be.
('16', 449, 4, 39, 998723) It is up to you to preserve the honour of India.
('16', 449, 4, 40, 998772) This struggle has turned into one
('16', 450, 0, 1, 998806) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 451
('16', 450, 1, 2, 998852) for self respect and prestige.
('16', 450, 1, 3, 998883) It is a struggle of the brave people of Kheda district to recover their lost property and prestige.
('16', 450, 1, 4, 998983) We must, for this purpose, reform our ways of daily living.
('16', 450, 1, 5, 999043) We must stop fighting with one another and get ready to fight oppression by an alien Government.
('16', 450, 1, 6, 999140) All suffering, whether of internal or external origin, should be treated with the magic remedy of satyagraha.
('16', 450, 1, 7, 999250) I would tell you, sisters, give courage to the men and for ever repeat this mantra: “The pledge can end only with death.” [From Gujarati] Kheda Satyagraha

('16', 450, 3, 9, 999426) April 22, 1918
('16', 450, 4, 10, 999441) I feel tempted to talk about the difference I observed between this village and Palaj.
('16', 450, 4, 11, 999528) When I entered Palaj, I noticed that there was no band there but instead there were the zanz 1 and the pakhaj 2. Hearing them, I remembered my childhood days.
('16', 450, 4, 12, 999687) The feelings of devotion they express, their sweetness and their art, I do not find in the band.
('16', 450, 4, 13, 999784) The band is a foreign thing; the zanz and the pakhaj are our own.
('16', 450, 4, 14, 999850) The band is an imitation, a novelty.
('16', 450, 4, 15, 999887) They are ancient.
('16', 450, 4, 16, 999905) The band may sound pleasant to the English and others, but it certainly does not to me.
('16', 450, 4, 17, 999993) Our ancestors invented an instrument that suited our country; for us, too, it is the only thing.
('16', 450, 4, 18, 1000090) In our religious ceremonies, both instrumental and vocal music find a place.
('16', 450, 4, 19, 1000167) Our native tunes have the power to elevate people from their fallen state; the band has no such power.
('16', 450, 4, 20, 1000270) Why should we, then, give up such simple, beautiful and sweet things as the zanz and the pakhaj?
('16', 450, 4, 21, 1000367) The difference between the band and the zanz pakhaj is the difference between modern and ancient ways.
('16', 450, 4, 22, 1000470) If our struggle is the same kind of thing as this band, it will come to nought.
('16', 450, 4, 23, 1000550) Just as the zanz pakhaj suggest a number of ideas, our struggle also has beautiful truths underlying it.
('16', 450, 4, 24, 1000655) If you grasp them clearly, we shall get wonderful results out of them.
('16', 450, 4, 25, 1000726) Despite all this enthusiasm I observe in you, I am afraid there appears to be an element of play acting in this struggle.
('16', 450, 4, 26, 1000848) We declare

('16', 451, 1, 2, 1000919) that we don’t mind confiscation of our lands, but deep down in our hearts, it seems to me, there is fear.
('16', 451, 1, 3, 1001025) If this is so, we are bound to lose and that will have unhappy consequences for the whole of India.
('16', 451, 1, 4, 1001125) I wish, therefore, that we carry on this fight, unflinchingly, with the aid of truth and dharma, as becomes our ancient civilisation.
('16', 451, 1, 5, 1001259) They say Gujarat is slumbering.
('16', 451, 1, 6, 1001291) Sometimes I am asked why this is so.
('16', 451, 1, 7, 1001328) But I think this charge that Gujarat is, like Kumbhakarna 1, in deep sleep, is undeserved.
('16', 451, 1, 8, 1001419) How can anyone say that, when we find so many men and women assembled here in the scorching heat of noon ?
('16', 451, 1, 9, 1001526) All the same, I should like to ask you whether we have really shaken off our slumber or are merely acting awake.
('16', 451, 1, 10, 1001639) The reply should come from the depths of your hearts, that you are no more acting, that you have joined the struggle in all sincerity.
('16', 451, 1, 11, 1001774) This struggle of ours is in the cause of truth.
('16', 451, 1, 12, 1001822) There should not be an iota of falsehood in it.
('16', 451, 1, 13, 1001870) When you succeed in convincing the Government of this, it will conduct itself as our own Government.
('16', 451, 1, 14, 1001971) If, on the contrary, we are trying to be smart or are hypocritical, the Government will not yield.
('16', 451, 1, 15, 1002070) For instance, some friends in Bhavnagar went on a strike, acting hastily.
('16', 451, 1, 16, 1002144) They did not know how to go on with it, not having the strength to suffer.
('16', 451, 1, 17, 1002219) They apologized to the Maharaja.
('16', 451, 1, 18, 1002252) All the world knows that the wages they receive are low but their strike secured them no increase.
('16', 451, 1, 19, 1002351) It gave me a shock to know that they had apologized.
('16', 451, 1, 20, 1002404) I do not understand why they did so.
('16', 451, 1, 21, 1002441) The mahajan, too, it may be said, brought humiliation to the strikers by his intervention.
('16', 451, 1, 22, 1002532) I hope that such a situation will not arise here.
('16', 451, 1, 23, 1002582) Ours is an honest request for relief, because the crops have been less than four annas.
('16', 451, 1, 24, 1002670) It is after the fullest deliberation that we declared we would not pay the land revenue.
('16', 451, 1, 25, 1002759) We knew what we were doing.
('16', 451, 1, 26, 1002787) We will never apologize.
('16', 451, 1, 27, 1002812) Our lands may be confiscated and we may be sent to jail; let us weigh this against truth, against our pledge and our self respect.
('16', 451, 1, 28, 1002943) Which will you find heavier?
('16', 451, 1, 29, 1002972) We are resolved not to surrender, not to betray our pledge.
('16', 451, 1, 30, 1003032) What is the purpose behind our pledge?
('16', 451, 1, 31, 1003071) To establish our right.
('16', 451, 1, 32, 1003095) Armies which have been fighting sometimes pay tributes; the side that pays is considered to have accepted defeat.
('16', 451, 1, 33, 1003209) It is our request to the Government that it should accept this fact.
('16', 451, 1, 34, 1003278) The voice of the panch is the voice of God.
('16', 451, 1, 35, 1003322) Public opinion is always supreme; we shall have won when we make the Government concede that it is the voice of God.

('16', 452, 1, 2, 1003628) But who can hope to win?
('16', 452, 1, 3, 1003653) There is no need to be afraid of the officer.
('16', 452, 1, 4, 1003699) We should always speak boldly, without reserve.
('16', 452, 1, 5, 1003747) The reserve between the Government and the people must go, as the false reserve between men and women must go.
('16', 452, 1, 6, 1003858) We can bring this about, not by brute force, but by soul force or the force of love.
('16', 452, 1, 7, 1003943) He wins who worships soul force.
('16', 452, 1, 8, 1003976) Brute force has no place in our struggle.
('16', 452, 1, 9, 1004018) We must win only by our soul force.
('16', 452, 1, 10, 1004054) The true hero is he who is ever ready for death.
('16', 452, 1, 11, 1004103) That is the true Kshatriya quality and to display it is the sole aim of our struggle.
('16', 452, 1, 12, 1004189) When India comes to feel that it has no use for the sword, not only the British but the entire world will come to honour us.
('16', 452, 1, 13, 1004314) By ‘us’, I mean truth.
('16', 452, 1, 14, 1004337) There is no arrogance in saying this.
('16', 452, 1, 15, 1004375) Where there is truth, there can be no defeat.
('16', 452, 1, 16, 1004421) We have to be very careful that we do not show ourselves wanting in this struggle; for this, we must cease quarrelling among ourselves.
('16', 452, 1, 17, 1004557) Our cause is just, no doubt, but the struggle is due chiefly to Mr. Pratt.
('16', 452, 1, 18, 1004632) Its only aim is to bring the Government to respect public opinion.
('16', 452, 1, 19, 1004699) The Viceroy is to hold a Durbar in Delhi; he will there request the country’s leaders to patch up our internal quarrels.
('16', 452, 1, 20, 1004820) I shall tell him in reply that it is not the Kheda people who are fighting, but the Commissioner.
('16', 452, 1, 21, 1004918) We are fighting in self defence.
('16', 452, 1, 22, 1004951) We have but held up our arm to ward off a blow; we have not attacked anyone.
('16', 452, 1, 23, 1005028) What would be my position, though, if meanwhile you yield?
('16', 452, 1, 24, 1005087) You must, therefore, remain firm and bear any losses you may be put to.
('16', 452, 1, 25, 1005159) Only so can it be proved that the blame lies not with the people, but with the Commissioner.
('16', 452, 1, 26, 1005252) I assure you that the Government cannot possibly confiscate your lands.
('16', 452, 1, 27, 1005324) They may do so on their records, but, in the absence of our signatures, the lands will not be lost to us.
('16', 452, 1, 28, 1005430) Till now, the responsibility was Vallabhbhai’s and mine jointly, but, when I am away in Delhi, the whole of it will be his.
('16', 452, 1, 29, 1005554) You, too, should share it.
('16', 452, 1, 30, 1005581) If you need my presence to keep you free from fear, this satyagraha will not be your struggle but mine.
('16', 452, 1, 31, 1005685) In truth, it is that of the people of Kheda, not mine nor Vallabhbhai’s, nor Anasuyabehn’s.
('16', 452, 1, 32, 1005777) I can only show you the path.
('16', 452, 1, 33, 1005807) It is for you to tread it.
('16', 452, 1, 34, 1005834) Success depends on the people of Kheda.
('16', 452, 1, 35, 1005874) If you remain firm and cling to truth, you are bound to win.
('16', 452, 1, 36, 1005935) Even the pledge, by itself, has spread your fame all over India; it is your dharma, then, to keep the pledge, to have courage, to maintain truthfulness and courtesy even while you preserve your self respect, that you may not lose the good name you have won.
('16', 452, 1, 37, 1006193) Dharma is more important than lands.

('16', 453, 7, 12, 1006886) I have been summoned to attend the War Conference 3. The first object is stated to be to sink domestic differences.
('16', 453, 7, 13, 1007002) This Kheda business falls under that category.
('16', 453, 7, 14, 1007049) I am not ashamed to approach you again and appeal to you in the name of the object of the Conference to recede from the position you have taken up.
('16', 453, 7, 15, 1007197) What a great relief it would be to the Viceroy if I could tell His Excellency that we had settled our domestic quarrel.
('16', 453, 7, 16, 1007317) I am leaving tonight for Bombay to attend the Begar Conference.

('16', 454, 3, 4, 1007825) DEAR MR. KER 1, Mr. Ghosal wrote to me about the Limbasi cotton crop.
('16', 454, 3, 5, 1007895) I agree that my undertaking included the cotton crop also.
('16', 454, 3, 6, 1007954) 2 1 have now made inquiries and I find that Limbasi people were ready to go to the cotton fields with the Talati, but the latter did not go.
('16', 454, 3, 7, 1008095) I understand that there is little cotton crop on fields that have no wheat crop, and all having the wheat crop have already delivered enough wheat to cover the amount of attachment.
('16', 454, 3, 8, 1008277) If my information is incorrect you will please correct me.
('16', 454, 3, 9, 1008336) I shall be away attending the War Conference.

('16', 454, 7, 16, 1008717) At present it is Maganlal, if anyone, who has so trained himself that he can carry on my work after me.
('16', 454, 7, 17, 1008821) Who will give him the needed strength?
('16', 454, 7, 18, 1008860) It is for you to show concern for his suffering, to be solicitous on his meals, to save him from all manner of worries.
('16', 454, 7, 19, 1008980) There is bitter quarrelling in Bhupatrai’s family; help them to put an end to it.
('16', 454, 7, 20, 1009062) I should like you to be active in such things.
('16', 454, 7, 21, 1009109) True learning and greatness lie in this.

('16', 455, 3, 6, 1009882) Be patient in taking Santok with you.
('16', 455, 3, 7, 1009920) Impatience shows absence of love.

('16', 455, 3, 9, 1010020) Your worrying is consuming you and it bars your progress.
('16', 455, 3, 10, 1010078) You should now come out of this state of mind.

('16', 455, 7, 18, 1010703) April 23, 1918
('16', 455, 8, 19, 1010718) I wish to add something to what the Chairman has told you about the steps which have been taken to secure relief from the Government.
('16', 455, 8, 20, 1010852) This struggle was not started by outsiders.
('16', 455, 8, 21, 1010896) Nobody instigated the Kheda public to launch it.
('16', 455, 8, 22, 1010945) There is no political motive behind it.
('16', 455, 8, 23, 1010985) It did not originate with the Home Rulers or with any barristers or lawyers as some people allege.
('16', 455, 8, 24, 1011084) I stand here to vouch for this.
('16', 455, 8, 25, 1011116) It was started by the tillers themselves.
('16', 455, 8, 26, 1011158) After the Political
('16', 455, 9, 27, 1011178) 1 Bhagavad Gita, II, 14 2 The sentence can also be read to mean: “The family quarrels of Bhupatrai will engulf Santok also.” 3 The meeting was held at Shantaram Chawl, Kandevadi, to acquaint the citizens with the situation in Kheda and to express sympathy with the satyagraha struggle there.
('16', 455, 9, 28, 1011470) Vithalbhai J. Patel presided.
('16', 455, 9, 29, 1011500) The proceedings were mostly in Gujarati and Marathi.
('16', 455, 9, 30, 1011553) A report appeared also in The Bombay Chronicle, 24 4 1918.
('16', 456, 0, 1, 1011612) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 457
('16', 456, 1, 2, 1011658) Conference at Godhra, some agriculturists in Kheda decided to request the Government for relief in view of the excessive rains.
('16', 456, 1, 3, 1011786) They wrote to me, informing me that they were legally entitled to relief and asking me whether I would help.
('16', 456, 1, 4, 1011895) You will thus see that this struggle did not originate with outside agitators, though it is true that it attracted the attention it did because of outside help.
('16', 456, 1, 5, 1012056) The support of our Chairman and the Hon’ble Gokuldasbhai 1 made the people confident of success.
('16', 456, 1, 6, 1012153) Some distinguished members of the Gujarat Sabha also made inquiries and convinced themselves that the crops had failed and that relief was called for.
('16', 456, 1, 7, 1012304) Their testimony was sufficient to justify the people’s stand; even so, everything possible was done to convince the officers.
('16', 456, 1, 8, 1012430) I testify to this.
('16', 456, 1, 9, 1012449) Satyagraha is not a way of fighting to which one can resort unless one has a real grievance.
('16', 456, 1, 10, 1012542) It requires more heroism than does fighting a battle.
('16', 456, 1, 11, 1012596) The soldier has weapons in his hand; his aim is to strike the enemy.
('16', 456, 1, 12, 1012665) The satyagrahi, on the contrary, fights by suffering himself.
('16', 456, 1, 13, 1012727) Surely, this is not for the weak and the diffident.
('16', 456, 1, 14, 1012779) Such a one would not be equal to the suffering.
('16', 456, 1, 15, 1012827) The greater the suffering a satyagrahi goes through, the purer he becomes.
('16', 456, 1, 16, 1012902) As gold is tested in fire, so also does a satyagrahi have to go through a fiery ordeal.
('16', 456, 1, 17, 1012990) His only weapon is uncompromising insistence on truth.
('16', 456, 1, 18, 1013045) A true satyagrahi fears nothing and holds fast to truth as he fights.
('16', 456, 1, 19, 1013115) Not men only, but women also have joined this struggle.
('16', 456, 1, 20, 1013171) Wonderful scenes are witnessed at the village meetings.
('16', 456, 1, 21, 1013227) The Women declare that even if the Government seize their buffaloes, attach their jewellery or confiscate their lands, the men must honour their pledge.
('16', 456, 1, 22, 1013380) This is a grand struggle, which has fired one and all.
('16', 456, 1, 23, 1013435) Its fragrance is spreading everywhere.
('16', 456, 1, 24, 1013474) It is beyond my power to describe the people of Kheda.
('16', 456, 1, 25, 1013529) They have it in them to help the Government in meeting the present danger.
('16', 456, 1, 26, 1013604) The Patidar claims to be a Kshatriya.
('16', 456, 1, 27, 1013642) The Government Press Note describes Kheda as a prosperous district, and in a sense this is quite true.
('16', 456, 1, 28, 1013745) As they say, “Broach is Broach, though in ruins”.
('16', 456, 1, 29, 1013795) When I look at people’s buildings, I am reminded of the greatness which was theirs.
('16', 456, 1, 30, 1013879) By their patience and diligence, by self exertion, they have turned the land of Kheda into a beautiful garden.
('16', 456, 1, 31, 1013990) Tears fill my eyes, though, when I look at their houses.
('16', 456, 1, 32, 1014047) They say they have no money, else their fields would have been a still more pleasant sight.
('16', 456, 1, 33, 1014139) The Government even now refuses the relief which it ought to

('16', 457, 1, 2, 1014260) have granted to such a brave people at a time of natural calamity.
('16', 457, 1, 3, 1014327) The reason for their lack lustre eyes is that they have had to go through such calamities time and again.
('16', 457, 1, 4, 1014433) Brothers and sisters who are present at this meeting!
('16', 457, 1, 5, 1014487) Go to Kheda district, inspect the big earthen jars in which they store grain to see if there is any, look for crops in their fields.
('16', 457, 1, 6, 1014620) If they have nothing with them, what are they to do?
('16', 457, 1, 7, 1014673) You can imagine from this how wretched their condition must have been.
('16', 457, 1, 8, 1014744) This is our plight, they said.
('16', 457, 1, 9, 1014775) If they could pay the year’s land revenue next year, they would save a year’s interest.
('16', 457, 1, 10, 1014863) But saving them interest is not the idea behind this struggle.
('16', 457, 1, 11, 1014926) Any wealthy magnate of Bombay could easily have paid them the amount, but that would not have ended their suffering.
('16', 457, 1, 12, 1015043) The Government would have assumed from this that every year they could raise money on interest and pay up.
('16', 457, 1, 13, 1015150) In this struggle I wish to establish the principle that the Government cannot decide on collection of land revenue without consulting the people.
('16', 457, 1, 14, 1015296) Merely saying that the Land Revenue Code is bad will not bring us relief.
('16', 457, 1, 15, 1015370) There is only one way to save ourselves from our suffering, and that is, by suffering voluntarily, to end our miseries once for all.
('16', 457, 1, 16, 1015503) Mr. Pratt, the Commissioner, is plain about this matter and says that, if he suspended the collection of land revenue this year, people all over the country would think that they could stand up against the Government even in such matters.
('16', 457, 1, 17, 1015742) This is an auspicious time for learning self suffering.
('16', 457, 1, 18, 1015798) We don’t get an opportunity like this every day.
('16', 457, 1, 19, 1015847) The people have exercised self restraint on this occasion as was but proper that they should.
('16', 457, 1, 20, 1015941) The people have transformed [this struggle] into a holy war.
('16', 457, 1, 21, 1016002) They declare that they will suffer voluntarily so that their suffering may end....
('16', 457, 1, 22, 1016085) My experience in Kheda and Champaran teaches me this one lesson, that, if the leaders move among the people, live with them, eat and drink with them, a momentous change will come about in two years.
('16', 457, 1, 23, 1016284) Make a deep study of this struggle; understand the worth of the people of Kheda; give all help you can by way of sympathy and verbal support.
('16', 457, 1, 24, 1016426) We shall not be arrogant in seeking justice.
('16', 457, 1, 25, 1016471) We seek it by awakening the Government to a sense of truth.
('16', 457, 1, 26, 1016531) The people will keep on fighting till they have secured justice.
('16', 457, 2, 27, 1016596) [From Gujarati] Kheda Satyagraha
('16', 457, 3, 28, 1016629) 1 When Gandhiji had finished his address, Tilak moved a resolution of sympathy for the Kheda cultivators, demanding of Government either revenue suspension for a year or the institution of an impartial inquiry into their grievances.
('16', 457, 3, 29, 1016862) B. G. Horniman later moved a resolution condemning the attitude taken by Commissioner Pratt in a speech on April 12.

('16', 458, 13, 13, 1017303) DEAR SIR,
('16', 458, 14, 14, 1017313) The Right Hon’ble Mr. Montagu, the Secretary of State for India, has announced his intention to visit our country for studying at first hand the present political situation in India.
('16', 458, 14, 15, 1017496) He is expected to be in India by the end of October 1917
('16', 458, 15, 16, 1017553) Mr. Montagu will in due course discuss the question of Reforms with the authorities and will also receive suggestions from representative bodies.
('16', 458, 15, 17, 1017699) But in view of the attitude which the Anglo lndian Press has begun to take and is sure to take, it is not sufficient for us merely to discuss the question with the Secretaryof State as representative bodies but it is imperatively necessary to strengthen his hands against the reactionary anti Reform forces by clearly and emphatically bringing to his notice the volume of public opinion in favour of Reforms.
('16', 458, 15, 18, 1018108) The opportunity is unique and to miss it would be almost culpable.
('16', 458, 16, 19, 1018175) With this view of our Sabha, at the suggestion of its President Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi has resolved to present a petition to Mr. Montagu, signed by the British subjects of Gujarat.
('16', 458, 16, 20, 1018364) The petition is short and is drafted by Mr. M. K. Gandhi in consultation with R. B. Ramanbhai M. Nilkanth.
('16', 458, 16, 21, 1018471) A copy of the petition is enclosed herein.
('16', 458, 17, 22, 1018514) You will note that the original petition is in Gujarati accompanied by an English translation.
('16', 458, 17, 23, 1018609) The Sabha has advisedly done so, as it is not possible to reach the masses of our countrymen through the medium of English.
('16', 458, 17, 24, 1018733) The Sabha is organising a volunteer corps for lecturing to the masses and explaining to them the Reform Scheme.
('16', 458, 17, 25, 1018845) The instructions to volunteers framed by Mr. Gandhi himself

('16', 459, 1, 2, 1018947) specially enjoin every volunteer not to take the signature to the petition of any person who does not understand the scheme, and of persons who are minors, students and Government servants.
('16', 459, 1, 3, 1019137) Every volunteer is supplied with a Gujarati translation of the Reform Scheme with a few introductory remarks printed in pamphlet form and the volunteer is strictly to confine himself to the contents of the pamphlet.

('16', 459, 6, 8, 1019469) Messrs Irwin, Hill and Norman to be summoned to Ranchi to consider three alternatives:
('16', 459, 7, 9, 1019556) A. Each should state the percentage by which he is prepared to reduce the sharahbeshi, on conditions:
('16', 459, 8, 10, 1019658) (1) that it should be a substantial advance on their previous offer; any advance made by the planters will be accepted as being substantial, in the hope of mutual goodwill in the future.
('16', 459, 9, 11, 1019845) (2) that this will be fully accepted by Mr. Gandhi as a satisfactory settlement and that he will use his influence fully with the raiyats to make them loyally accept it and to bring about future peace in the relations of planters and their tenants.
('16', 459, 10, 12, 1020094) (3) that fully binding effect will be given to the settlement by legislation.
('16', 459, 10, 13, 1020172) B. Failing the above, the question of sharahbeshi should be submitted to arbitration.
('16', 459, 10, 14, 1020258) Such arbitration to be conducted on one or other of the following alternatives: (1) The appointment of a single arbitrator, who shall have the power to arbitrate between the limits of reduction of 20 and 40 per cent for Turkaulia and 25 and 40 per cent for Motihari and Peeprah.
('16', 459, 10, 15, 1020537) Such arbitrator to be selected with mutual agreement of planters and of Mr Gandhi.
('16', 459, 11, 16, 1020620) (2) The appointment of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by the planters, one by Mr Gandhi and the umpire to be appointed by these two, and failing agreement between these two, the umpire to be appointed Sir Edward Gait.
('16', 459, 11, 17, 1020846) The arbitration court so appointed shall have power to arbitrate between the limits of no reduction at all and a full reduction of 100 per cent.
('16', 459, 11, 18, 1020991) The arbitrators to be informed that for a settlement by consent the planters have offered a reduction of 20 per cent in Turkaulia and
('16', 460, 0, 1, 1021125) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 461
('16', 460, 1, 2, 1021171) 25 per cent in Motihari and Peeprah, and that Mr. Gandhi on behalf of the raiyats has offered to accept reduction of 40 per cent, but that those offers are now withdrawn and the arbitrators have full power to make any award they may settle.
('16', 460, 2, 3, 1021412) Under both alternatives, conditions (2) and (3) of A will apply.
('16', 460, 2, 4, 1021477) In addition under all the proposals, it shall be a condition that the existing obligation recorded in the settlement records shall be abolished and that in lieu thereof sharahbeshi shall be fixed at the rate at which it would have stood had commutation in their case taken place together with the others, less reduction that may be agreed upon or awarded by the arbitration.
('16', 460, 2, 5, 1021852) Under proposals for arbitration, both the planters and Mr. Gandhi would submit written statements of their case, and both would have the option of submitting a written reply to such statements.
('16', 460, 2, 6, 1022046) The parties will not be permitted to be represented by counsel or to be heard personally as of right.
('16', 460, 2, 7, 1022148) The arbitrator or arbitrators to have the power to call for any papers they may desire to question the planters or any other person, and to give their award within one week of the filing of the written statements and rejoinders of the parties.

('16', 461, 4, 5, 1023578) CHAPTER I
('16', 461, 5, 6, 1023588) CONSTITUTION AND PROCEDURE OF THE COMMITTEE
('16', 461, 6, 7, 1023632) APPOINTMENT OF COMMITTEE AND TERMS OF REFERENCE
('16', 461, 7, 8, 1023680) The Champaran Agrarian Enquiry Committee was appointed by the Government of Bihar and Orissa in Resolution No.
('16', 461, 7, 9, 1023791) 1890 C, dated the 10th June, 1917, which is reproduced below.
('16', 461, 8, 10, 1023853) “On various occasions during the past fifty years, the relations of landlords and tenants and the circumstances attending the growing of indigo in the Champaran district have been the cause of considerable anxiety.
('16', 461, 8, 11, 1024068) The conditions under which indigo was cultivated when the industry was flourishing required re adjustment when it declined simultaneously with a general rise in the prices offoodgrains; and it was partly on this account and partly owing to other local causes that disturbances broke out in certain indigo concerns in 1908. Mr. Gourlay was deputed by the Government of Bengal to investigate the causes of the disturbances; and his report and recommendations were considered at a series of conferences presided over by Sir Edward Baker and attended by the local officers of Government and representatives of the Bihar Planters’ Association.
('16', 461, 8, 12, 1024707) As the result of these discussions, revised conditions for the cultivation of indigo, calculated to remove the grievances of the raiyats, were accepted by the Bihar Planters’ Association.
('16', 461, 9, 13, 1024895) “In 1912 fresh agitation arose, connected not so much with the conditions under which indigo was grown as with the action of certain factories which were reducing their indigo manufacture and taking agreements from their tenants for the payment, in lieu of indigo cultivation, of a lump sum in temporarily leased villages or of an increase of rent in villages under permanent lease.
('16', 461, 9, 14, 1025278) Numerous petitions on this subject were presented from time to time to the local officers and to Government, and petitions were at the same time filed by raiyats of villages in the north of the
('16', 461, 10, 15, 1025472) Bettiah sub division in which indigo had never been grown, complaining of the levy of abwab or illegal additions to rent by their leaseholders, both Indian and European.
('16', 461, 11, 16, 1025642) The issues raised by all these petitions related primarily to rent and tenancy conditions; and as the revision settlement of the district was about to be undertaken, in the course of which the relations existing between landlords and tenants would come under detailed examination, it was thought advisable to await the report of the settlement officers before passing final orders on the petitions.
('16', 461, 11, 17, 1026041) The revision
('16', 462, 0, 1, 1026054) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 463
('16', 462, 1, 2, 1026100) settlement was started in the cold weather of 1913. On the 7th April, 1915, a resolution was moved in the local Legislative Council, asking for the appointment of a mixed committee of officials and non officials to enquire into the complaints of the raiyats and to suggest remedies.
('16', 462, 1, 3, 1026383) It was negatived by a large majority, including 12
('16', 462, 2, 4, 1026434) out of the 16 non official members of the Council present, on the ground that the appointment of such a committee at that stage was unnecessary, as the settlement officers were engaged in the collection of all the material required for the decision of the questions at issue, and an additional enquiry of the nature proposed would merely have the effect of further exacerbating the relations of landlord and tenant, which were already feeling the strain of the settlement operations.
('16', 462, 3, 5, 1026918) “The settlement operations have now been completed in the northern portion of the district and are approaching completion in the remainder, and a mass of evidence regarding agricultural conditions and the relations between landlords and tenants has been collected.
('16', 462, 3, 6, 1027183) A preliminary report on the complaints of the tenants in the leased villages in the north of the Bettiah subdivision, in which no indigo is grown, has been received and action has already been taken to prohibit the levy ofillegal cesses and, in the case of the Bettiah Raj, to review the terms of the leases on which the villages concerned are held.
('16', 462, 3, 7, 1027533) As regards the complaints of the raiyats in
('16', 462, 4, 8, 1027577) other parts of the district, the final report of the settlement officer has not yet been received, but recent events have again brought into prominence the whole question of the relations between landlords and tenants and, in particular, the taking of agreements from the raiyats for compensation or for enhanced rent in return for the
('16', 462, 5, 9, 1027913) abandonment of indigo cultivation.
('16', 462, 5, 10, 1027948) In these circumstances, and in deference to representations which have been received from various quarters that the time has come when an enquiry by a joint body of officials and non officials might materially assist the Local Government in coming to a decision on the problems which have arisen, the Lieutenant Governor in Council has decided, without waiting for the final report of the settlement operations, to refer the questions at issue to a Committee of Enquiry, on which all interests concerned will be represented.
('16', 462, 6, 11, 1028473) “The following committee has accordingly been appointed with the approval of the Government of India:
('16', 462, 7, 12, 1028575) PRESIDENT
('16', 462, 8, 13, 1028585) F. G. Sly, Esq., C.S.I., Commissioner, Central Provinces.

('16', 463, 3, 4, 1029071) M. K. Gandhi, Esq.
('16', 463, 4, 5, 1029090) SECRETARY
('16', 463, 5, 6, 1029100) E. L. Tanner, Esq., I.C.S., Settlement Officer, South Bihar.
('16', 463, 6, 7, 1029161) “The duty of the Committee will be
('16', 463, 7, 8, 1029196) (1) to inquire into the relations between landlord and tenant in the Champaran district, including all disputes arising out of the manufacture and cultivation of indigo;
('16', 463, 8, 9, 1029366) (2) to examine the evidence on these subjects already available, supplementing it by such further inquiry, local and otherwise, as they may consider desirable; and
('16', 463, 9, 10, 1029530) (3) to report their conclusions to Government, stating the measures they recommend in order to remove any abuses or grievances which they may find to exist.
('16', 463, 10, 11, 1029687) “The Lieutenant Governor in Council desires to leave the Committee a free hand as to the procedure they will adopt in arriving at the facts.
('16', 463, 11, 12, 1029828) “The Committee will assemble about the 15th July and will, it is hoped, complete their labours within three months.”
('16', 463, 12, 13, 1029945) PROCEDURE FOLLOWED BY THE COMMITTEE
('16', 463, 13, 14, 1029981) 2. A notice was published by the Committee in the provincial newspapers and posted at the Motihari Collectorate and the Bettiah Sub divisional Office, inviting all persons, associations and public bodies who desired to give written evidence to send the same to the address of the Secretary of the Committee, and stating that the Committee would hold sittings at Bettiah, Motihari and any other centres where it was considered necessary, commencing about the 15th July.
('16', 463, 14, 15, 1030450) In response to this notice, written statements were received from the Bihar Planters’ Association and two managers, one of an indigo and the other of a non indigo concern, from twenty five raiyats, from Mr. Whitty, C.I.E., I.C.S.,
('16', 463, 15, 16, 1030681) Manager of the Bettiah estate, and from Mr. Sweeney, I.C.S., Settlement Officer, North Bihar, Mr. Lewis, I.C.S., Sub divisional Officer of Bettiah, Mr. L. F. Morshead, I.C.S., Commissioner of Tirhut, and Mr. E. H. Johnston, I.C.S., formerly Sub divisional Officer of Bettiah.
('16', 463, 15, 17, 1030957) The Bihar Landholders’ Association was specially invited to submit a memorandum of its views, but replied that it was not in possession of the material and facts concerning the agrarian conditions in
('16', 464, 0, 1, 1031157) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 465
('16', 464, 1, 2, 1031203) Champaran and was not therefore in a position to submit a written opinion.
('16', 464, 2, 3, 1031278) The Committee held a preliminary meeting at Ranchi on the 11th July to decide the procedure and extent of its inquiry, and its public sittings commenced at Bettiah on Tuesday, the 17th July.
('16', 464, 2, 4, 1031469) Eight public sittings were held at Bettiah and Motihari at which nineteen witnesses were examined, consisting of four Government officers (the Settlement Officer, the Sub divisional Officer of Bettiah, the Collector of the Champaran district, and the Manager of the Bettiah estate), three representatives of the raiyats the representative of the Bihar Planters’ Association,
('16', 464, 3, 5, 1031844) and twelve managers of concerns.
('16', 464, 3, 6, 1031877) We also made local investigations at eight concerns, where we examined in detail the managers together with the factory registers and accounts and the raiyats who had submitted written memoranda, and then made numerous enquiries from the large bodies of raiyats assembled to meet us.
('16', 464, 4, 7, 1032161) We desire to acknowledge the great assistance derived by us from the official records placed at our disposal by the local Government and the full information given to us by the managers of concerns and the facilities afforded by them for the examination of their records and registers.

('16', 464, 7, 10, 1032491) PRELIMINARY—THE LANDLORDS
('16', 464, 8, 11, 1032517) 3. The Government has supplied us with previous records relating to the history, economic condition and former agrarian disputes of the Champaran district.
('16', 464, 8, 12, 1032673) Our enquiry has not been sufficiently prolonged for us to be able to add usefully to that information, and we do not propose to reproduce in this report the materials already available, but only to state a few broad facts directly relevant to our present enquiry.
('16', 464, 8, 13, 1032937) For historical reasons, the district has always been one of large landed estates, and more than three fourths of it is still held by three large proprietors, viz., the Bettiah estate which has been under the management of the Court of Wards since 1898, the Ramnagar estate which has also been taken under management, and the Madhuban estate.
('16', 464, 8, 14, 1033279) The system of leasing villages to thikadars has always been largely followed by the Bettiah and Ramnagar estates, the number of villages managed direct and leased to thikadars now being as follows:

('16', 465, 1, 2, 1033703) The thikadari system has never prevailed to the same extent in the Madhuban
('16', 465, 2, 3, 1033779) estate of 163 villages, but some are also leased.
('16', 465, 3, 4, 1033829) The European indigo planters form much the most important class of thikadars in the district.
('16', 465, 3, 5, 1033923) Some of the older indigo concerns (e.g..
('16', 465, 3, 6, 1033964) Turkaulia, Peeprah,
('16', 465, 4, 7, 1033984) Motihari and Rajpur) have held many villages continuously in lease from the Bettiah estate since the first decade of the 19th century, while others have been established at later dates.
('16', 465, 4, 8, 1034170) In the north west of the district there are also European thikadars who
('16', 465, 5, 9, 1034242) have never grown indigo or have not done so until the last two years.
('16', 465, 5, 10, 1034312) In the Settlement of 1892 99 it was found that the European thikadars exercised landlord
('16', 465, 6, 11, 1034401) rights over 46 per cent of the district, and it seems likely that the area is now slightly larger.
('16', 465, 6, 12, 1034500) Broadly, it may be said that about half the district is in lease to European thikadars, and much more than half the district to thikadars of all kinds.
('16', 465, 6, 13, 1034652) Permanent leases known as mukarrari have in some cases been granted both by the Bettiah and Ramnagar estates.
('16', 465, 6, 14, 1034762) The Bettiah mukarrari leases date from the year 1888 and their
('16', 465, 7, 15, 1034825) *These figures have been supplied by the Manager of the Bettiah estate.
('16', 465, 7, 16, 1034897) The total number of villages in the estate is only 1,630 according to the Settlement Officer, and apparently there is some difference in the village unit.
('16', 465, 8, 17, 1035052) †These figures have been supplied by the Settlement Officer.
('16', 465, 9, 18, 1035113) grant formed part of a large transaction for the raising of the sterling loan by which the debts of the estate were consolidated and the rate of interest payable on them reduced.
('16', 465, 9, 19, 1035292) Under the terms of these leases the position of the lease holder concerns is practically that of a zamindar, the rent being fixed in perpetuity.
('16', 465, 9, 20, 1035437) We have not succeeded in ascertaining the circumstances in which mukarrari leases were
('16', 465, 10, 21, 1035524) granted by the Ramnagar estate, but there seems little doubt that as in Bettiah their origin is to be found in the financial embarrassments of the proprietor.
('16', 465, 11, 22, 1035683) AREA UNDER INDIGO AND METHODS OF CULTIVATION
('16', 465, 12, 23, 1035728) 4. The area under indigo at the time of the Settlement of 1892 99 was
('16', 465, 13, 24, 1035798) 98,000 acres which was 6.63 per cent of the net cropped area, but its importance in
('16', 465, 14, 25, 1035882) the agricultural economy of the district was much greater than this percentage
('16', 465, 15, 26, 1035961) indicates.
('16', 465, 15, 27, 1035972) About one third of this area was cultivated by the indigo concerns in their
('16', 465, 16, 28, 1036048) own lands and about two thirds by tenants.
('16', 465, 16, 29, 1036091) Owing to the competition of synthetic
('16', 465, 17, 30, 1036129) indigo the area had fallen to 52,600 acres in 1907 and to 8,100 acres in 1914, but
('16', 465, 18, 31, 1036212) under the stimulus of high prices during the war, the area has again expanded to
('16', 465, 19, 32, 1036293) 21,900 acres in 1916. The cultivation of indigo carried on by the factories in lands
('16', 465, 20, 33, 1036378) which they occupy directly either as proprietors or tenure holders (commonly known as zirat cultivation) does not call for special notice.
('16', 465, 20, 34, 1036517) But the condition under which
('16', 466, 0, 1, 1036547) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 467
('16', 466, 1, 2, 1036593) indigo is grown by the tenants for the factories has in the past been the cause of disputes on several occasions, and though we do not consider it necessary to enter into the history of these disputes, we cannot explain the causes of the present unrest without giving some account of the system.
('16', 466, 1, 3, 1036889) In essentials it does not appear to have varied during the last 100 years.
('16', 466, 1, 4, 1036964) Under this system, the tenant agrees to grow indigo for the factory in a portion of his holding.
('16', 466, 1, 5, 1037061) The fraction of the holding so cultivated appears at one time to have been as high as five kathas in the bigha ( = one fourth), but before 1867 it had already been reduced to four kathas, and in 1868 it was fixed at three kathas, whence the name tinkathia which is commonly applied to this system.
('16', 466, 1, 6, 1037359) In 1910 the fraction was fixed at two kathas ( = one tenth) by a bye law of the Planters’ Association, but the name tinkathia has survived.
('16', 466, 1, 7, 1037499) Where indigo is grown
('16', 466, 2, 8, 1037521) under this system, the terms of the agreement between the landlord and the tenant are usually embodied in a document which is called the satta.
('16', 466, 2, 9, 1037665) In it the tenant
('16', 466, 3, 10, 1037682) acknowledges the receipt of an advance and binds himself to cultivate a specified area with indigo annually.
('16', 466, 3, 11, 1037791) The preparation and weeding of the selected fields, and the cutting of the crop when ripe, are done by the cultivator at his own expense the seed is given by the factory, and the sowing is done by the factory and raiyat jointly; the
('16', 466, 4, 12, 1038024) green crop is carted from the field to the factory at the factory’s expense.
('16', 466, 4, 13, 1038101) The rate to be paid for the bigha of indigo is fixed by the satta and does not vary with the actual
('16', 466, 5, 14, 1038201) outturn of plant.
('16', 466, 5, 15, 1038219) If owing to ca uses for which the tenant is not responsible the crop is a failure, only half rates are paid, provided the tenant is allowed to plough up the indigo in time to sow another crop during the same season.
('16', 466, 5, 16, 1038435) A portion of the price is given as an advance free of interest to the tenant at the beginning of the cultivating season, but is usually credited in the rent account and is not paid in cash.
('16', 466, 5, 17, 1038625) The satta
('16', 466, 6, 18, 1038635) also contains a penalty clause specifying the amount of the damages which the factory may recover from the tenant if he fails to carry out the agreement, e.g., if he sows other crops in the land measured for indigo.
('16', 466, 7, 19, 1038851) The khushki system by which the raiyat grows indigo for the factory but not
('16', 466, 8, 20, 1038927) under factory supervision and sells the produce by weight or some method of appraisement seems to have been rare in Champaran until a very recent date.
('16', 466, 8, 21, 1039079) It will be more fully discussed in a later paragraph.
('16', 466, 9, 22, 1039133) THE PRICE PAID FOR INDIGO
('16', 466, 10, 23, 1039159) 5. The price paid to the tenants for the indigo so cultivated has varied from time to time.
('16', 466, 10, 24, 1039251) We find that in 1869 after a period of friction and disturbance, the price generally paid by the factories was raised from approximately Rs. 6 8 0 to Rs. 9 per acre and again in 1877 after another troubled period to Rs. 11 5 0. In that year, it was also for the first time distinctly laid down—previous practice had varied—that the rent of the land under indigo was to be remitted.
('16', 466, 10, 25, 1039633) In 1897, the Bihar Planters’ Association spontaneously raised the rate to Rs. 12 per acre.
('16', 466, 10, 26, 1039724) Finally, in 1910, after.
('16', 467, 0, 1, 1039749) 468 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 467, 1, 2, 1039791) Mr. Gourlay’s enquiry, the price was raised to Rs. 13 per acre at which it now stands.
('16', 467, 1, 3, 1039878) If the remission of the rent of the indigo lands be taken into account, the price received by the tenant is approximately Rs. 15 8 0 per acre.
('16', 467, 1, 4, 1040021) A general complaint was made to us by the tenant that the cultivation of indigo at this rate of payment caused them substantial pecuniary loss compared to the profits that they could derive from country crop at their present level of prices.
('16', 467, 1, 5, 1040263) Some leading planters have admitted, and it is not, we believe, seriously disputed by any that the direct return to the cultivator in money from indigo is less than from country crops, but stress is laid on certain indirect advantages, such as the undoubted value of indigo as a rotation crop, and also the benefit derived by the tenant from an advance free of interest at the beginning of the cultivating season which amounts to half the price of the crop.
('16', 467, 1, 6, 1040721) Finally, it is urged that the low rates of rent at which the tenants hold their land are directly connected with the growing of indigo and must be taken into account when the fairness of the price is considered.
('16', 467, 1, 7, 1040933) It is unnecessary for us to attempt the difficult task of estimating the pecuniary position of the tenant under the tinkathia system of indigo cultivation,
('16', 467, 2, 8, 1041089) because we are satisfied that on other grounds the system is radically defective and should be discontinued.
('16', 467, 3, 9, 1041198) DEFECTS IN THE SYSTEM UNDER WHICH INDIGO IS GROWN
('16', 467, 4, 10, 1041248) 6. There are several points connected with the system which in our opinion are directly responsible for its worst features.
('16', 467, 4, 11, 1041372) The first is that the price paid to the cultivator is fixed and remains unchanged for a long period of years.
('16', 467, 4, 12, 1041482) We are aware that the prices fixed by the Bihar Planters’ Association are minimum prices, but as soon as they have received the imprimatur of the Association, they are regarded as the
('16', 467, 5, 13, 1041666) authorized rates and in practice are paid by all concerns.
('16', 467, 5, 14, 1041725) In the course of fifty years, the price paid to the tenant has been doubled in order to adjust the price paid for indigo to the general rise in the level of prices during that period.
('16', 467, 5, 15, 1041909) But the price of indigo being fixed at each stage and the rise in general prices being continuous, it follows that, if the price was fair at the beginning of any period, it had become too low by the end of it.
('16', 467, 5, 16, 1042119) Of itself, this would tend to cause discontent, and it will be noticed that with the exception of the increase made in 1897, every rise in price was preceded by a period of friction and discontent, and a valid objection to the system is that an increase in the price of indigo was seldom effected except by disturbance and agitation.
('16', 467, 6, 17, 1042453) The second point is that the price is fixed on the area and does not vary with the outturn of the crop.
('16', 467, 6, 18, 1042557) This leads directly to two defects.
('16', 467, 6, 19, 1042593) The selection by the factory of the plots to be cultivated with indigo is a feature of the system which has often been called in question.
('16', 467, 6, 20, 1042732) It is certainly liable to abuse, e.g., it is asserted that homestead lands in the immediate vicinity of the village site and which are consequently the best manured are frequently selected for indigo.
('16', 467, 6, 21, 1042933) The real gravamen of
('16', 468, 0, 1, 1042954) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 469
('16', 468, 1, 2, 1043000) the charge about the selection of lands does not, however, lie in the possibility of abuse, but in the fact that the system itself is bad.
('16', 468, 1, 3, 1043139) So long as the planter has to pay the same price for a good or a bad crop, he will select for indigo the better lands in the holding.
('16', 468, 1, 4, 1043273) This selection of lands is resented by the cultivator not merely from the fact that the best lands are selected but because it involves interference with his freedom of action.
('16', 468, 1, 5, 1043450) We believe that this is a principal cause of the unpopularity of indigo, and in this respect the system is radically defective.
('16', 468, 2, 6, 1043578) The payment of a fixed rate per acre leads directly to another feature of the system which is equally responsible for its unpopularity, namely, the close supervision of the indigo cultivation exercised by the factory subordinates.
('16', 468, 2, 7, 1043809) This supervision undoubtedly affords an opportunity for a great deal of petty tyranny, and the cultivator resents being compelled to carry out the various cultivation processes not at the time most convenient to himself, but at the time when the work is considered necessary by factory subordinates.
('16', 468, 2, 8, 1044109) The system gives opportunities to the factory servants to harass cultivators against whom they may have a grudge; or to exact payment as the price of their favour.
('16', 468, 2, 9, 1044273) A good manager accessible to his raiyats
('16', 468, 3, 10, 1044314) may be able to keep the oppression of his subordinates within small limits, but even the best of managers cannot prevent altogether oppressive acts by low paid subordinates placed in a position of authority.
('16', 468, 3, 11, 1044522) So long as the payment is made on the area and does not vary with the outturn, and the tenant has no interest in the outturn, close supervision will be essential.
('16', 468, 3, 12, 1044685) In this respect also, we consider that the system is inherently bad.
('16', 468, 4, 13, 1044754) Another important objection to the tinkathia system is the fact that the
('16', 468, 5, 14, 1044827) growing of indigo is connected with a sense of obligation.
('16', 468, 5, 15, 1044886) We are satisfied that for the last fifty years the growing of tinkathia indigo has been disliked by the raiyat
('16', 468, 6, 16, 1044997) and that he would at any time have been glad to relinquish it.
('16', 468, 6, 17, 1045060) Whether such sense of obligation had any legal foundation is a matter for the decision of a legal tribunal, but its unpopularity is shown by the large extent to which the tenants have in recent years purchased their release.
('16', 468, 6, 18, 1045285) In the interests of the future peace of the districts, it is essential that the relations of landlord and tenant should be clearly defined by the law, and that the growing of indigo should cease to be connected with any sense of obligation or any customary right.
('16', 468, 7, 19, 1045549) PROPOSAL THAT THE “TINKATHIA” SYSTEM SHOULD BE ABOLISHED
('16', 468, 8, 20, 1045606) 7. We find therefore that the tinkathia system is unpopular with the raiyats who
('16', 468, 9, 21, 1045687) regard it as unprofitable, is radically defective in some important respects, and is inconsistent with the relations that should exist between landlord and tenant under modern conditions.
('16', 468, 9, 22, 1045875) We accordingly recommend that this system of growing indigo in Champaran should be altogether abolished, and that legislation should be undertaken to effect this change.
('16', 468, 9, 23, 1046045) This proposal will affect tenancies in which the growing of
('16', 469, 0, 1, 1046105) 470 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 469, 1, 2, 1046147) indigo has been recorded as an incident of the tenancy in the Record of Rights and a recommendation on this point will be made in a later paragraph.
('16', 469, 2, 3, 1046296) FUTURE SYSTEM OF GROWING INDIGO
('16', 469, 3, 4, 1046328) 8. It is not our intention of course that indigo should cease to be grown but that it should be grown under fair and reasonable conditions.
('16', 469, 3, 5, 1046468) Indigo is already grown by some factories on the voluntary system (khushki), and we consider that this is the
('16', 469, 4, 6, 1046578) system which alone should be permitted for the future.
('16', 469, 4, 7, 1046633) The essential features of such a system are:
('16', 469, 5, 8, 1046678) (1) The tenant must be absolutely free to enter into the contract or to refrain from making it.
('16', 469, 6, 9, 1046774) (2) The particular plots to be devoted to indigo must be entirely at the option of the raiyat.
('16', 469, 7, 10, 1046869) (3) The price paid for the indigo must be settled by voluntary agreement and entirely on a commercial basis.
('16', 469, 8, 11, 1046978) (4) The price must be fixed on the weight of the crop, but such weight may, if agreed, be settled by appraisement of the weight by a selected panch 1
('16', 469, 9, 12, 1047128) instead of by actual weighment.
('16', 469, 10, 13, 1047160) (5) The contract must be for an emphatically short period not exceeding three years.
('16', 469, 11, 14, 1047245) To the last condition we attach importance.
('16', 469, 11, 15, 1047289) In the interests of the tenant, we do not think that he should be allowed to bind himself to his landlord to grow a particular crop at a rate of payment fixed for many years in advance, and in Champaran long contracts would directly tend to keep alive the sense of obligation which we desire to end.
('16', 469, 12, 16, 1047589) We are in general averse from fixing by outside authority the minimum prices to be paid for particular crops, because of the strong tendency of such prices to become maximum prices.
('16', 469, 12, 17, 1047771) In view, however, of the past history of the indigo industry, we believe that a safeguard of some kind will be necessary for the first few years.
('16', 469, 12, 18, 1047917) We recommend therefore that, until the Local Government is satisfied that the safeguard can be dispensed with, a minimum price for indigo should be fixed by the Bihar Planters’ Association, subject to the approval of the Commissioner of the Division.
('16', 469, 13, 19, 1048168) CONVERSION OF THE INDIGO OBLIGATION
('16', 469, 14, 20, 1048204) 9. The manufacture in Germany in the middle nineties of synthetic indigo, which enabled the German firms to undersell the natural product, produced a profound
('16', 469, 15, 21, 1048363) 1 Arbitrator
('16', 470, 0, 1, 1048376) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 471
('16', 470, 1, 2, 1048422) effect on the indigo industry in Bihar.
('16', 470, 1, 3, 1048462) The price of the natural dye steadily diminished and though efforts were made to reduce the cost of production and to increase the outturn (e.g., by the introduction of the Java plant which gave a larger outturn of colouring matter per acre), these efforts met with but indifferent success.
('16', 470, 1, 4, 1048753) One by one, the factories abandoned the hope of successful competition with the synthetic dye and began to turn their attention to other measures, the principal being the taking of compensation in one form or another for releasing the tenant from the cultivation of indigo.
('16', 470, 2, 5, 1049027) Two concerns in the north of the district substituted a fixed payment of paddy in lieu of the cultivation of indigo, but this practice was recently abandoned owing to the disapproval expressed by Government.
('16', 470, 2, 6, 1049235) Some other concerns substituted sugarcane or oats for indigo.
('16', 470, 2, 7, 1049297) We have been informed that the Bara concern has in some cases substitued sattas for l_ kathas of sugar in lieu of 3 kathas of indigo.
('16', 470, 3, 8, 1049431) are still grown to a limited extent in lieu of indigo by the Mallahia, Bairia and Kuria concerns.
('16', 470, 3, 9, 1049529) The growing of crops other than indigo under satta conditions is expressly
('16', 470, 4, 10, 1049604) forbidden by a bye law of the Bihar Planters’ Association adopted in 1910 at the instance of Government after the disturbances which took place at the end of 1908. Those disturbances affected four factories, of which Mallahia, Bairia and Kuria are three.
('16', 470, 4, 11, 1049859) It is, we think, regrettable that those factories should have continued to act in direct contravention of a bye law which was passed with special reference to practices in these concerns.
('16', 470, 5, 12, 1050047) In 1911, a general movement towards the abandonment of indigo began which continued unchecked till the outbreak of the war in 1914, when a large rise in the price of indigo once more made the manufacture a profitable one.
('16', 470, 5, 13, 1050269) Two different methods of commutation were generally adopted.
('16', 470, 5, 14, 1050330) In some cases, agreements were executed by the tenants for the payment of enhanced rents, commonly known as sharahbeshi.
('16', 470, 5, 15, 1050451) In other cases, the raiyats purchased freedom from indigo for a
('16', 470, 6, 16, 1050515) lumpsum, sometimes paid in cash and sometimes by a money bond bearing 12 per cent interest.
('16', 470, 6, 17, 1050607) This method is called tawan or tamam.
('16', 470, 6, 18, 1050645) In both cases, a promise was given to the tenant that in consideration of the payment of sharahbeshi or tawan, as
('16', 470, 7, 19, 1050759) the case may be, neither the factory itself nor its successors in interests would in future ask him to grow indigo for them under the tinkathia conditions.
('16', 470, 8, 20, 1050915) Sharahbeshi has been taken by only five concerns, viz., Turkaulia, Motihari,
('16', 470, 9, 21, 1050992) Peeprah, Jallaha and Sirni, the two last being outworks of Turkaulia which were sold in recent years, and only in the villages which the factories held in mukarrari lease
('16', 470, 10, 22, 1051163) from the Bettiah estate and the very few held by them in proprietary right.
('16', 470, 10, 23, 1051239) In the villages held in temporary lease all these concerns, except Peeprah, took tawan, and
('16', 470, 11, 24, 1051331) it was also taken by nine other concerns, of which the most important are Rajpur, Bara, Bairia and Bhelwa.
('16', 470, 11, 25, 1051438) The rates at which sharahbeshi was taken varied widely in

('16', 471, 1, 2, 1051538) the different concerns, but on the average the enhancement amounted to between 50 and 60 per cent of the previous rents.
('16', 471, 1, 3, 1051659) The following table shows the average amount of the enhancement and the proportion it bore to the previous rent in four concerns:

('16', 471, 11, 13, 1051965) The percentage is highest in Peeprah where the previous rents had been exceptionally low.
('16', 471, 11, 14, 1052055) The rate of tawan also varied, and was usually calculated on the portion of the holding in which indigo was grown, i.e., three kathas in the bigha.
('16', 471, 12, 15, 1052203) The payment was frequently fixed on the basis of the amount which the factory had realized in indigo damage suits when the tenant had failed to carry out his agreement.
('16', 471, 12, 16, 1052372) The amount taken as tawan varied from Rs. 66 to Rs. 20 per acre and probably on the
('16', 471, 13, 17, 1052456) average was between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 per acre, which would be equivalent to a payment of Rs. 7 8 0 to Rs. 9 on each acre of the holding.
('16', 471, 14, 18, 1052594) In the concerns affected by this conversion, about 50,000 acres of indigo were formerly cultivated under tinkathia conditions, and of this area over 40,000 acres were released—18,000 acres by taking tawan and 22,000 acres by taking sharahbeshi.
('16', 471, 14, 19, 1052839) At the recent settlement, tinkathia has been recorded as an incident of the tenancy only in the five concerns of Turkaulia, Motihari, Peeprah, Jallaha and Sirni, and the area of
('16', 471, 15, 20, 1053017) indigo over which it is claimed by these factories amounts to 1,910 acres, though we\ have no information as to what extent the incident has been recorded.
('16', 471, 15, 21, 1053173) We have endeavoured to secure statistics of the present indigo cultivation from all factories and, although not quite complete for the whole district, the omissions are insignificant.
('16', 471, 15, 22, 1053357) They show that a total area of 26,848 acres of indigo is made up as follows:
('16', 471, 16, 23, 1053434) Zirat cultivation 10,697 acres
('16', 471, 17, 24, 1053465) Tinkathia cultivation 9,542 ,,
('16', 471, 18, 25, 1053496) Khushki cultivation 6,609 ,,
('16', 471, 19, 26, 1053525) COMMUTATION BY ENHANCED RENT—“SHARAHBESHI”
('16', 471, 20, 27, 1053568) 10. The enhanced rents taken in lieu of indigo in every case exceeded the limit
('16', 472, 0, 1, 1053648) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 473
('16', 472, 1, 2, 1053694) of two annas in the rupee to which enhancement contracts are ordinarily restricted by section 29, clause (b) of the Bengal Tenancy Act.
('16', 472, 1, 3, 1053830) Under the third proviso to the section, however, this limit does not apply when the raiyat has held his land at a
('16', 472, 2, 4, 1053944) specially low rate of rent in consideration of cultivating a particular crop for the convenience of his landlord.
('16', 472, 2, 5, 1054058) It is contended by the concerns that their tenants were under an obligation to grow indigo in three katha in the bigha of their holdings, that
('16', 472, 3, 6, 1054201) the rents of holdings had been determined in consideration of this obligation, and that because of the obligation the concerns had refrained from enhancement of rents.
('16', 472, 3, 7, 1054369) It is asserted, in fact, that the obligation to grow indigo was an incident of the tenancy.
('16', 472, 3, 8, 1054461) In support of this contention, the concerns have referred to certain sattas and kabuliyats executed by some of the tenants before 1880 in which the obligation to grow indigo in three kathas in the bigha is recorded.
('16', 472, 3, 9, 1054677) On behalf of the raiyats, it is
('16', 472, 4, 10, 1054709) contended that in fact they were under no legal obligation to grow indigo or that if there were any obligation they did not hold their land at a specially low rate of rent because of it.
('16', 472, 4, 11, 1054896) It is also urged that whether the enhancements were legal or not, it is inequitable that the tenants should be called on to pay an enhanced rent as the price of relief from a burden under which they had long suffered.
('16', 472, 4, 12, 1055114) Finally, it is urged that the agreements were executed by the raiyats under coercion or under influence or in
('16', 472, 5, 13, 1055224) ignorance of their true legal position.
('16', 472, 6, 14, 1055264) Mr. Sweeney, Settlement Officer, informed us that these enhancements had been the subject of enquiry during the Revision Settlement and he described to us the principles followed by the Settlement Department in dealing with these cases.
('16', 472, 6, 15, 1055501) The legality of the enhancements has also been considered by the Civil Court in nine suits brought by tenants of the Turkaulia concern asking for a declaration that the kabuliyats in which they agreed to pay the enhanced rents should be declared void on
('16', 472, 7, 16, 1055755) the ground that they were executed under coercion and were not in accordance with the law.
('16', 472, 7, 17, 1055846) These suits are now before the High Court in appeal.
('16', 472, 8, 18, 1055899) Our enquiries satisfied us that the feeling of the raiyats against enhancements
('16', 472, 9, 19, 1055979) was very strong and that every legal means would be used to upset them.
('16', 472, 9, 20, 1056051) Without special legislation, prolonged and expensive litigation seemed inevitable.
('16', 472, 9, 21, 1056134) However such litigation might end, it would produce a permanent embitterment of feeling on both sides.
('16', 472, 9, 22, 1056237) We are also impressed with the great desirability of an immediate settlement between landlords and tenants of this difficult question.
('16', 472, 9, 23, 1056372) In these circumstances, it seemed to us very important that if possible a settlement should be arranged by consent with mutual concessions made by both parties in the interests of peace and goodwill.
('16', 472, 9, 24, 1056572) With this object, we entered into negotiations with the representatives of the three principal concerns, and we are glad to report that our efforts have been successful.
('16', 472, 9, 25, 1056742) At a meeting held in Ranchi on 29th September at which Messrs Hill, Irwin, and Norman, the managers of Turkaulia Limited, Motihari
('16', 473, 0, 1, 1056873) 474 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 473, 1, 2, 1056915) Limited, and Peeprah concerns, were present and at which Mr. Gandhi represented the interests of the raiyats, an agreement was reached on the following terms:
('16', 473, 2, 3, 1057074) (1) The enhancement effected by sharahbeshi shall be reduced with effect from the commencement of the fasli year 1325 (October 1917) by 20 per
('16', 473, 3, 4, 1057217) cent in the case of Turkaulia Limited, and by 26 per cent in the case of Motihari Limited and the Peeprah concern, the rents for years prior to 1325 fasli remaining unchanged at the Survey Settlement rates.
('16', 473, 4, 5, 1057424) (2) The existing indigo obligation recorded in the Survey Records shall be abolished from the commencement of the fasli year 1325 and in lieu the enhanced rent (sharahbeshi) shall be fixed at the rate at which it would
('16', 473, 5, 6, 1057643) have stood had commutation taken place together with the others less the reduction now agreed upon.
('16', 473, 6, 7, 1057743) As the representative of the raiyats, our colleague Mr. Gandhi fully accepts
('16', 473, 7, 8, 1057820) this arrangement as a satisfactory settlement and he undertakes to use his influence fully with the raiyats to make them loyally accept it and to bring about future peace in
('16', 473, 8, 9, 1057994) the relations of planters and their tenants.
('16', 473, 8, 10, 1058039) This settlement is subject to the condition that full binding effect must be given to it by legislation.
('16', 473, 8, 11, 1058144) We regard this settlement as equitable to all interests concerned and therefore recommend that action should be immediately taken by emergency legislation to render this settlement by consent binding on all the parties concerned.
('16', 473, 9, 12, 1058374) As regards the two small concerns of Jallaha and Sirni, which are not parties to this settlement by consent, we recommend that the reduction should be fixed at 26 per cent upon the same conditions as in Motihari and Peeprah.
('16', 473, 10, 13, 1058599) COMMUTATION BY MONEY PAYMENTS—“TAWAN”
('16', 473, 11, 14, 1058637) 11. We have still to consider the cases in which the indigo obligation has been commuted for a lump sum payment which method we regard as distinctly prejudicial to the interests of the tenants.
('16', 473, 11, 15, 1058831) The taking of tawan has been defended by
('16', 473, 12, 16, 1058872) the factories in two different ways.
('16', 473, 12, 17, 1058909) Some concerns do not allege that there was anyincident of tenancy or obligation on the tenant to grow indigo apart from the satta and urge that the payment was made by the tenants for the termination of a
('16', 473, 13, 18, 1059114) contract on terms mutually satisfactory to the parties.
('16', 473, 13, 19, 1059170) But this theory that the payment was made by the tenants for the termination of a contract appears to us to be exposed to almost insuperable difficulties.
('16', 473, 13, 20, 1059325) It is not obvious why, when both parties desire to terminate a contract, a large payment should be made by one of them, particularly when the proposal to terminate the contract originates with the party who is to receive the money.
('16', 473, 13, 21, 1059557) In no concern, we believe, did the rate of payment vary according to the length of time which the contract had still to run, though this might certainly have been expected had the contract alone been in question.
('16', 473, 13, 22, 1059770) Again, in every
('16', 474, 0, 1, 1059786) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 475
('16', 474, 1, 2, 1059832) case where tawan was taken, it was a part of the bargain that the tenant received a
('16', 474, 2, 3, 1059916) promise that he would never again be required to grow indigo either by the present proprietors of the factory or by any person to whom the factory might be transferred.
('16', 474, 2, 4, 1060085) There is no doubt, in our opinion, that what the raiyat paid for was a final release
('16', 474, 3, 5, 1060170) from the obligation to grow indigo and that he would not have voluntarily paid such large sums merely for release from the unexpired period of the satta.
('16', 474, 4, 6, 1060324) The older factories which took sharahbeshi in their mukarrari villages and tawan in the villages in temporary lease give a different explanation.
('16', 474, 4, 7, 1060470) They assert in
('16', 474, 5, 8, 1060485) both cases the existence of an incident of tenancy, i.e., an obligation to grow indigo as a part of the condition on which the tenant held his land.
('16', 474, 5, 9, 1060634) But if the factory enhanced rents in a temporarily leased village, nine tenths of the profit would at the next renewal pass to the superior landlord.
('16', 474, 5, 10, 1060784) The result is that a peculiar claim is advanced by the factory.
('16', 474, 5, 11, 1060848) It is asserted that the obligation to grow indigo imposed on the tenant could be claimed only by the factory and not by the superior landlord, and that therefore the factory was entitled to commute the incident and take the whole of the proceeds, in which the superior landlord could claim no share.
('16', 474, 5, 12, 1061148) This assumes that a temporary lease holder, when setting land with a tenant, can create an incident of tenancy the benefit of which can be claimed only by him.
('16', 474, 5, 13, 1061308) No legal authority for this position was placed before us, and we regard it as wholly untenable.
('16', 474, 5, 14, 1061405) If an incident attaches to the tenancy, then the benefit can be enjoyed by the lease holder only so long as he holds the lease and no longer.
('16', 474, 5, 15, 1061547) The indigo incident has not been claimed and is not now claimed by the Bettiah estate, and the claim of the factories in the form in which it has been presented to us must, we think, be wholly rejected.
('16', 474, 6, 16, 1061750) It seems to us, therefore, that whichever theory be adopted, the taking of tawan was not justified in temporarily leased villages.
('16', 474, 6, 17, 1061881) If it be said that the payment
('16', 474, 7, 18, 1061912) was for the termination of a contract, the answer is that that is not what the tenant desired to buy, nor is it the most important thing the factory sold, that is, final release from indigo.
('16', 474, 7, 19, 1062103) If it is said that the tenant was under an obligation to grow indigo as one of the conditions on which he held his land it is evident that the payment was of the nature of capitalized rent and if so the interests of the superior landlord were prejudiced.
('16', 474, 7, 20, 1062358) Since the taking of tawan was within the knowledge of the
('16', 474, 8, 21, 1062416) Bettiah estate, which took no action to stop it, we consider that the estate itself must accept some share of the responsibility.
('16', 474, 8, 22, 1062546) We recommend that where tawan has been
('16', 474, 9, 23, 1062585) taken in temporarily leased villages, the Bettiah estate should make it a condition of the renewal of the temporary leases that 25 per cent of the tawan collected should be
('16', 474, 10, 24, 1062758) paid to the estate, and that the estate should refund it to the tenant concerned.
('16', 474, 10, 25, 1062840) Moreover, since tawan must be regarded at least in part as capitalized rent, we
('16', 474, 11, 26, 1062920) recommend that the Bettiah estate should for a period of seven years forgo any enhancement, which may be granted in the Settlement Courts on the ground of the
('16', 475, 0, 1, 1063079) 476 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 475, 1, 2, 1063121) rise in prices, of the rent of a tenant who has paid tawan.
('16', 475, 2, 3, 1063181) We have been informed that in a few cases where villages had very recently come into lease to a factory, the management procured the execution of sattas by the raiyats and, after growing indigo for one or two years, commuted the indigo rights by taking tawan.
('16', 475, 2, 4, 1063441) Action of this kind seems to us totally indefensible and the Bettiah
('16', 475, 3, 5, 1063510) estate is bound in the interests of its tenants to interfere.
('16', 475, 3, 6, 1063572) We recommend that in such cases, the Court of Wards should refuse to renew the temporary leases of the concern unless the whole of the tawan is refunded.
('16', 475, 4, 7, 1063726) Tawan was also taken in some of the permanently leased villages by a few
('16', 475, 5, 8, 1063799) concerns, of which the most important is Rajpur.
('16', 475, 5, 9, 1063848) In view of the fact that a reduction of sharahbeshi has been accepted under the settlement by consent in the interests of future peace and goodwill, we consider that the mukarraridars should be advised by the Local Government to make a refund on a similar basis of a portion of the tawan taken by them.
('16', 475, 5, 10, 1064151) In consideration of the low rate of tawan taken by the Rajpur concern,
('16', 475, 6, 11, 1064222) we consider that a reduction of ten per cent would be adequate.
('16', 475, 7, 12, 1064286) SPECIAL CASE OF RAJGHAT CONCERN
('16', 475, 8, 13, 1064318) 12. Finally, we desire to refer to the peculiar conditions of the Rajghat factory (manager, Mr. Apperley), where no incident of tenancy is claimed but where written contracts had been entered into by the tenants for the growing of indigo in consideration of freedom from rent enhancement.
('16', 475, 8, 14, 1064607) On the expiry of these contracts, this arrangement was continued by mutual consent, and consequently the factory refrained from applying for rent enhancement at the proper time during the revision settlement.
('16', 475, 8, 15, 1064816) At our local enquiry, we were informed by the tenant that they now desired to abandon indigo.
('16', 475, 8, 16, 1064910) Under these circumstances, it is only reasonable that the factory should be enabled to apply for a general enhancement of rents in accordance with the settlement procedure, but as the time limit for this procedure under section 105 of the Bengal Tenancy Act has already expired, this is impossible unless the Government takes action under section 112 of the Bengal Tenancy Act.
('16', 475, 8, 17, 1065288) Failing this course, we recommend that the special legislation should contain a clause enabling this concern to take advantage of section 105.
('16', 475, 9, 18, 1065431) CHAPTER III “ABWAB” AND THE RENEWAL OF “THIKA” LEASES “ABWAB”
('16', 475, 10, 19, 1065493) 13. Our enquiry has shown that until recently, certain sums were regularly levied from the tenants in addition to the recorded rent by the thikadars of the
('16', 475, 11, 20, 1065649) non indigo concerns in the north west portion of the district, which unauthorized dues are generally known as abwab.
('16', 475, 11, 21, 1065766) The imposition of abwab was forbidden by
('16', 476, 0, 1, 1065807) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 477
('16', 476, 1, 2, 1065853) section 54 of the Decennial Settlement Regulation (VIII of 1793), which definitely laid down that all landlords should consolidate the abwab with the rent into one sum before a fixed date and prohibited under penalty the imposition of any new abwab.
('16', 476, 2, 3, 1066103) This prohibition was again enforced by section 10 of Act X of 1859, and by section 74 of the Bengal Tenancy Act (VIII of 1885).
('16', 476, 2, 4, 1066231) For many years past, no abwab have
('16', 476, 3, 5, 1066266) been realized in villages under the direct management of the Bettiah Estate, but although the estate received no direct benefit therefrom, the thikadars of non indigo
('16', 476, 4, 6, 1066433) concerns continued their realization until this illegal practice was recently brought to notice at the revision settlement, when orders were issued by the Court of Wards prohibiting the levy of anything in excess of the recorded rent and authorized cesses.
('16', 476, 4, 7, 1066690) The evidence taken by us shows that this action has achieved its object.
('16', 476, 4, 8, 1066763) In some indigo concerns we found that the tenants made a small annual payment known as farkhawan, which is usually taken direct by the patwari at the time of rent collection.
('16', 476, 5, 9, 1066938) This practice is also contrary to the law, the landlord being responsible for the patwari’s emoluments.
('16', 476, 5, 10, 1067042) The systematic levy of abwab still prevails in the Ramnagar estate.
('16', 476, 5, 11, 1067110) In one lease produced before us, certain abwab are specified as payable by the thikadar to the estate, and in addition there is a clause binding him to assist in collecting certain dues “which are realized from the tenants and banias according to the ancient custom”.
('16', 476, 5, 12, 1067378) The abwab realized by the thikadars bear many names, 1 most of
('16', 476, 6, 13, 1067441) which are of old standing, but the full development of the system seems to be comparatively recent and does not go back beyond the last quarter of the nineteenth century.
('16', 476, 6, 14, 1067612) It took the form of an amalgamation and an enhancement of the old abwaband the consolidated levy thenceforth passed under a single name, usually salami or panikharcha (irrigation due).
('16', 476, 6, 15, 1067797) Occasionally, as in the Bhasurari concern, this levy is called tinkathia by analogy with the indigo obligation although no indigo is grown.
('16', 476, 6, 16, 1067937) The amount of the levy is usually Rs. 3 to Rs. 3 8 0 per bigha and is
('16', 476, 7, 17, 1068007) equivalent to an addition to the rent of from 60 to 100 per cent.
('16', 476, 7, 18, 1068073) The collection of abwab in this manner has been systematically adopted by the European thikadars of
('16', 476, 8, 19, 1068173) this estate who until recently never grew indigo, and also by a number of Indian thikadars and petty proprietors.
('16', 476, 8, 20, 1068287) We received no complaint of the systematic collection of abwab in the rest of the district, and it appears that at least of recent
('16', 476, 9, 21, 1068418) 1 The names of the principal abwab, according to the report, are Bandhberi (embankment due), Panikharcha (irrigation due), Chulhi awan and Kolhu awan (taxes on turmeric ovens and sugarcane or oil presses), Bapahi putahi (inheritance tax), Marwach and Sagaura (tax on marriages of girls and windows), Hisabana (accountancy fee), Tahrir (writing fee), Jungla Isamnavisi (fee for writing forest lists), Batchhapi (fee on weights and measures), Dasahari and Chaitnawami (festival taxes), Gurubhenti and Uprohiti (priestly dues).
('16', 476, 9, 22, 1068943) These abwab were not always levied under these separate names and varied from village to village
('16', 477, 0, 1, 1069040) 478 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 477, 1, 2, 1069082) years an occasional levy only has been taken by some landlords for a special purpose, such as a marriage in the proprietor’s family.
('16', 477, 2, 3, 1069215) In spite of the general exaction of these irregular dues in the north west tract of the district, not a single suit has been brought under section 75 of the Bengal Tenancy Act, which provides the legal remedy.
('16', 477, 2, 4, 1069425) The Collector is of opinion that the section remained a dead letter because the tenants did not complain and because there are difficulties in enforcing the law.
('16', 477, 2, 5, 1069587) It has been suggested to us that section 75 should be amended in order to give power to the Collector to deal with cases summarily on the lines of section 58 and we agree that a special remedy is required to meet the peculiar conditions of the Champaran district.
('16', 477, 2, 6, 1069851) We also consider that it should be made more generally known that the exaction of abwab is illegal.
('16', 477, 2, 7, 1069951) Connected with this exaction is
('16', 477, 3, 8, 1069983) the practice of landlords’ servants levying a commission on payments made by tenants known as dasturi, which is equally illegal.
('16', 477, 3, 9, 1070112) We, therefore, recommend that:
('16', 477, 4, 10, 1070143) (1) Government should issue a proclamation informing all landlords and raiyats that both abwab and the dasturi taken by landlords’ servants are
('16', 477, 5, 11, 1070287) illegal and must be stopped;
('16', 477, 6, 12, 1070316) (2) the Court of Wards should take steps to enforce those prohibitions in the estates under its charge; and
('16', 477, 7, 13, 1070424) (3) the special legislation recommended by us for the Champaran district should contain a clause providing that the Collector of his own motion may enquire into and punish the exaction by a landlord from a tenant of any sum in excess of the rent payable, his decision being subject to the ordinary appeal.
('16', 477, 7, 14, 1070730) The penalty might appropriately be fixed at a fine not exceeding Rs. 50 or double the amount of the exaction, whichever is greater.
('16', 477, 7, 15, 1070862) Our colleague, the Hon’ble Rajah Kirtyanand Singh, dissents from this proposal for legislation.
('16', 477, 8, 16, 1070958) RENT RECEIPT
('16', 477, 9, 17, 1070971) 14. Where abwab are systematically levied, the practice is to credit the first payments made by a tenant to that demand and a receipt is not given until he has paid off the whole abwab and at least some portion of his rent.
('16', 477, 9, 18, 1071195) This is facilitated by the fact that rent receipt are not usually given until payments for the year have beencompleted.
('16', 477, 9, 19, 1071315) Again, no receipts at all are given for the payment of produce rents.
('16', 477, 9, 20, 1071385) The intention of the Legislature, clearly shown by the form of rent receipt prescribed in schedule II of the Bengal Tenancy Act, was that the first payment of rent in any year should be entered in the receipt given to the raiyat who would produce this receipt for the entry of subsequent payments.
('16', 477, 9, 21, 1071683) We were informed during the course of our local enquiries that such a procedure is unsuitable for Champaran because the tenants fail to produce the first receipt at the time of subsequent payments.
('16', 477, 9, 22, 1071881) The alternative procedure, if the law is to be followed, is to give a full receipt for every
('16', 478, 0, 1, 1071974) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 479
('16', 478, 1, 2, 1072020) payment, which would involve a great increase in clerical labour because rents are frequently paid in small instalments.
('16', 478, 1, 3, 1072141) We consider it essential that some form of receipt should be given for these intermediate payments, though it need not be so elaborate as the prescribed form, and we therefore recommend that the Local Government should use its power under the proviso to section 56 (3) to prescribe a simple form of receipt for intermediate payments, the full receipt being reserved for the final payment.
('16', 478, 1, 4, 1072530) The inter mediate receipt need only contain the name of the tenant and his khatian number, the amount paid with date of payment and the account on which it was paid.
('16', 478, 2, 5, 1072696) RENEWAL OF “THIKA” LEASES
('16', 478, 3, 6, 1072722) 15. We have already described in paragraph 3 the large extent to which the thikadari system prevails in the district.
('16', 478, 3, 7, 1072840) If we believed that the abuses of the
('16', 478, 4, 8, 1072878) past were inseparable from that system, and that good relations between landlord and tenant could not be secured under it in the future, it would be our duty to recommend its abolition.
('16', 478, 4, 9, 1073064) But although we consider that good relations between landlord and tenant can ordinarily best be secured under an efficient system of direct management, which follows the general policy laid down in the Court of Wards Manual, they can also be obtained under a suitable thikadari system.
('16', 478, 4, 10, 1073350) We are opposed
('16', 478, 5, 11, 1073365) to any extension of that system, and if for any reason the lease of a village is not renewed, it seems preferable to take it under direct management rather than to lease it to another thikadar.
('16', 478, 5, 12, 1073559) The thikadari system of the Bettiah and Ramnagar estates was not created by the Court of Wards; many of the thikadars are of very old standing,
('16', 478, 6, 13, 1073703) and there may be other reasons arising out of their previous relations which render it inadvisable to make a sudden change of policy.
('16', 478, 6, 14, 1073837) If the conduct of a thikadar has been detrimental to the interests of the raiyats or of the superior landlord, his conduct
('16', 478, 7, 15, 1073960) should be scrutinized before the lease is renewed.
('16', 478, 7, 16, 1074011) In cases where the Court of Wards decides to renew the leases, we consider it preferable that they should be granted for moderately long periods, subject to cancellation for breach of the conditions, rather than that the periods should be short.
('16', 478, 7, 17, 1074257) In these circumstances, the commission granted to the lessee should be sufficient to cover the cost of collection (including irrecoverable arrears) and a reasonable remuneration for himself.
('16', 478, 7, 18, 1074448) Unlessthe estate offers its thikadars reasonable terms, it cannot evade all responsibility for resulting
('16', 478, 8, 19, 1074553) abuses.
('16', 478, 8, 20, 1074561) What a fair commission would be can no doubt be calculated for each tenure.
('16', 478, 8, 21, 1074637) On the other hand, where the commission to be given to the thikadar exceeds the
('16', 478, 9, 22, 1074717) estimated cost of direct management, the renewal of the leases on such terms requires special justification on the merits of each case.
('16', 478, 9, 23, 1074853) Finally, the leases should contain conditions enforcing such recommendations of the Committee as are accepted by Government, including in particular stipulations that no indigo should be grown except on a voluntary system, and that no abwab should be taken.
('16', 478, 9, 24, 1075111) We consider that the estate should hold itself responsible for the well being of tenants in thika
('16', 479, 0, 1, 1075209) 480 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 479, 1, 2, 1075251) villages and when that well being is in danger, should be responsible for the remedy.
('16', 479, 2, 3, 1075337) CHAPTER IV
('16', 479, 3, 4, 1075348) OTHER GRIEVANCES OF TENANTS
('16', 479, 4, 5, 1075376) FEES ON TRANSFERS
('16', 479, 5, 6, 1075394) 16. It remains for us to deal with various other matters some of which have been sources of trouble in the past and some of which are suggestions made for the improvement of agrarian conditions.
('16', 479, 5, 7, 1075589) The first is the levy of fees on the transfers of occupancy holdings.
('16', 479, 5, 8, 1075659) So far as fees are levied on transfers by inheritance, they are illegal, as the right of inheritance is given by section 26, Bengal Tenancy Act, and no custom exists in derogation of this right.
('16', 479, 5, 9, 1075854) Such fees under the name of Bapahi Putahi have been already referred to as an abwab in Chapter III.
('16', 479, 5, 10, 1075954) As regards transfers
('16', 479, 6, 11, 1075975) otherwise than by inheritance, it may be noted that the consent of the landlord is required by law to the transfer of a portion of a holding since that involves a sub division of the tenancy (section 88, Bengal Tenancy Act).
('16', 479, 6, 12, 1076200) The transferability of an occupancy holding depends on custom.
('16', 479, 6, 13, 1076263) In Champaran, the general custom is stated to be that no transfer can be made without the landlord’s consent, so that legally landlord can take a fee for recognized transfers otherwise than by inheritance, and this appears to be the usual practice.
('16', 479, 6, 14, 1076512) At the same time, however, we think that it would be desirable in the interests of good management to adopt a uniform scale of fees where it is possible to do so; e.g., in estates under the Court of Wards.
('16', 479, 6, 15, 1076718) This scale might be varied from time to time, if necessary, and its existence would not derogate from the right of veto possessed by the landlord even if the transferee offered the prescribed fee, for it would only be taken where the transfer had been approved.
('16', 479, 6, 16, 1076980) We recommend, therefore, that a moderate scale of fees be fixed from time to time in estates under the Court of Wards which should be enforced in villages held direct or under temporary lease, and that as regards villages let in mukarrari lease, the estate should use its best
('16', 479, 7, 17, 1077257) endeavour to induce the lease holder to adopt the same policy.
('16', 479, 7, 18, 1077320) The procedure followed by the Bettiah Estate in dealing with applications for mutation of names has been criticised.
('16', 479, 7, 19, 1077437) At present, the attendance of the parties at Bettiah is required, which causes unnecessary inconvenience, as local enquiries are always necessary.
('16', 479, 7, 20, 1077584) At the same time, we do not think it desirable to entrust thikadars with the power of disposing of such applications even subject to an appeal to the Manager.
('16', 479, 7, 21, 1077743) We recommend, therefore, that the power of sanctioning mutations should rest with the Estate Manager but that the applications may, if the applicant wishes, be made through the thikadar, who would forward it with his report to the Manager and who would communicate to the applicant the orders when received.
('16', 479, 8, 22, 1078051) RIGHTS IN HIDES
('16', 479, 9, 23, 1078067) 17. A complaint that has become prominent lately refers to the right claimed by the Bettiah and Ramnagar Estates and some of their tenure holders to all the hides
('16', 480, 0, 1, 1078230) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 481
('16', 480, 1, 2, 1078276) of dead cattle.
('16', 480, 1, 3, 1078292) With the rise in the value of hides in recent years, the question of ownership has become more important and has led to changes in the old custom under which a chamar took from the estate the lease of the right to the hides of a village for
('16', 480, 2, 4, 1078533) a small sum and supplied the tenants with a fixed number of shoes and other articles, whilst in addition his wife gave her service as midwife.
('16', 480, 2, 5, 1078676) The Charsa Mahal as it is called, of the Bettiah Estate was leased out to various persons, some of whom took the right to the hides over a large area and some of whom were chamars who took the
('16', 480, 3, 6, 1078869) right in individual villages.
('16', 480, 3, 7, 1078899) The total annual income of the Estate from this source is about Rs. 3,000. This right to hides was made over with other miscellaneous assets to the indigo concerns who were granted mukarrari leases in 1887. In the Ramnagar
('16', 480, 4, 8, 1079122) Estate, we understand the income from the Mahal in the past two years has been Rs. 79,000. The Manager of the Bettiah Estate has tried to justify the claim on the ground of custom and supports it on the ground of public policy for the prevention of cattle poisoning.
('16', 480, 4, 9, 1079389) On the other hand, it is urged that the hide is the legal property of the owner of the dead animal and that the present practice grew irregularly out of fees paid by the chamars for the use of waste land for skinning dead animals.
('16', 480, 4, 10, 1079620) The question of
('16', 480, 5, 11, 1079636) the validity by custom of such a right is one for legal decision.
('16', 480, 5, 12, 1079702) We doubt, however, whether such a custom even where proved can override the natural right of the owner of the dead animal to dispose of its hide in any way he pleases.
('16', 480, 5, 13, 1079870) Subject, therefore, to any legal right which the landlords may be held to possess, we are of opinion that the hides are the property of the owner of the dead animal who is entitled to dispose of them as he wishes, whether by sale or in exchange for services.
('16', 480, 6, 14, 1080129) KEROSENE OIL MONOPOLY
('16', 480, 7, 15, 1080151) 18. A somewhat similar claim to the monopoly of the trade in kerosene oil has been abandoned by the Bettiah Estate and we think that the mukarraridars who
('16', 480, 8, 16, 1080306) derive their claim from the estate should also abandon the practice of issuing licencesfor the sale of kerosene oil.
('16', 480, 8, 17, 1080423) Such a practice is clearly not legally enforceable and acts detrimentally in restraint of trade.
('16', 480, 9, 18, 1080520) RIGHTS IN TREES
('16', 480, 10, 19, 1080536) 19. A widespread discontent is manifest among the raiyats in respect of the
('16', 480, 11, 20, 1080612) rights in trees.
('16', 480, 11, 21, 1080629) The legal position has been ascertained both at the settlement of 1892 99 and at the present revision settlement.
('16', 480, 11, 22, 1080743) It appears that trees growing in tenants’ holdings cannot be felled without the consent of the landlord, and half the value of the timber of dead or felled trees belongs to him.
('16', 480, 11, 23, 1080921) The tenant urges that he pays rent for the land and the whole produce of it including the trees should belong to him, but, on the other hand, the rent was fixed in consideration of the custom and there is the legal right of the landlord.
('16', 480, 11, 24, 1081159) The tenant undoubtedly feels the restraint in not being able to take wood even from his own holding when he wants it without
('16', 481, 0, 1, 1081284) 482 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 481, 1, 2, 1081326) obtaining permission and with the possibility of abuse by subordinates.
('16', 481, 1, 3, 1081398) On the other hand, there is the danger that the handing over of all the trees to the raiyats might
('16', 481, 2, 4, 1081497) lead to their rapid destruction.
('16', 481, 2, 5, 1081530) The district is exceptionally well wooded, and we understand that in Saran, where the tenants have full rights in trees in lands for which a cash rent is paid, no evidence of general denudation is apparent.
('16', 481, 2, 6, 1081737) In view of the inconvenience resulting from the present custom, we recommend that in the Bettiah Estate the raiyats should be given the option of purchasing the landlord’s half share
('16', 481, 3, 7, 1081920) in the timber, the valuation to be made on fair principles, and, in case of disputes, referred to assessors.
('16', 481, 3, 8, 1082029) If it is found in practice that applications for purchase are received in such large numbers from any particular area as to make it probable that undue denudation might take place, the Estate would be able to limit the option.
('16', 481, 4, 9, 1082256) GRAZING RIGHTS
('16', 481, 5, 10, 1082271) 20. During our enquiry, we found that practically all the waste land has been recorded as being in the exclusive possession of the landlords, except certain small plots used for communal purposes such as roads, burial grounds, sites for threshing floors and the like.
('16', 481, 5, 11, 1082539) This permits the landlords to break up all waste for cultivation or to enclose it for his exclusive use.
('16', 481, 5, 12, 1082644) It has been urged that this is detrimental to the welfare of the village community and provides a weapon of which unfair use may be made by a bad landlord in cases of dispute with his tenants.
('16', 481, 5, 13, 1082837) There is little doubt that a village is benefited by some land being left for communal use, not necessarily large enough to provide for grazing of all the village cattle but at least adequate to provide the cattle with an exercise ground where they can move about freely without undue risk of trespass on cropped land.
('16', 481, 5, 14, 1083156) We, therefore, recommend that proprietors and permanent tenure holders should be advised to set apart suitable plots of land for communal use in the way suggested, and that the Court of Wards should do this in the villages under their direct management, while in villages on lease a similar reservation should be made after due enquiry before the renewal of any lease, conditions relating to such reservation being inserted in the lease.
('16', 481, 7, 15, 1083594) 21. Complaints were received by us from some raiyats that the rates paid by
('16', 481, 8, 16, 1083670) the landlords for labour are inadequate.
('16', 481, 8, 17, 1083711) No claim was urged before us by any landlord to any right over the labour, ploughs or carts of his tenants, and it is admitted that labour of all kinds should be taken on a voluntary basis and paid for at local market rates.
('16', 481, 8, 18, 1083936) While it is clearly impossible for us to prescribe suitable rates for all classes of labour, we consider that it would be an advantage for the Bihar Planters’ Association to lay down a minimum scale of wages based on the local market rates to be paid by concerns in membership.
('16', 481, 8, 19, 1084214) We recognize the danger that the minimum might in practice be regarded as the maximum, but rates of wages change slowly and the
('16', 482, 0, 1, 1084342) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 483
('16', 482, 1, 2, 1084388) adoption of the proposal would at least enable the Association to ascertain whether a concern was prima facie paying inadequate wages and to exercise a stronger position
('16', 482, 2, 3, 1084558) of control.
('16', 482, 2, 4, 1084570) We, therefore, recommend that all labour should be on a purely voluntary basis and paid for at local market rates, that a minimum tariff of labour wages should be fixed on the basis of local market rates by the Association with the approval of the Commissioner of the Division, and that this tariff should be revised from time to time in accordance with the local rates.
('16', 482, 3, 5, 1084941) CART “SATTAS”
('16', 482, 4, 6, 1084955) 22. Closely connected with the question of labour is the supply of carts.
('16', 482, 4, 7, 1085029) Most indigo factories require a number of carts at particular seasons of the year for the carting of the indigo crop to the factory and the refuse to the fields.
('16', 482, 4, 8, 1085191) Most factories keep sufficient carts for their ordinary requirements throughout the year, but hire the extra carts required on such special occasions.
('16', 482, 4, 9, 1085342) In order to ensure a regular supply of carts, agreements (sattas) are made with the cartmen to supply carts with bullocks at
('16', 482, 5, 10, 1085467) certain seasons for a fixed period of year at a fixed rate, and the consideration for these agreements invariably takes the form of an advance which is in some cases sufficient to cover the initial cost of a cart and pair of bullocks.
('16', 482, 5, 11, 1085702) Generally, however, it is about Rs. 30 or Rs. 40. We recognize that contracts of this nature are essential to the interests of the industry, and the system is unobjectionable provided the rates paid are fair and the periods not too long, but we consider the periods of these contracts extending in some cases to twenty years are prejudicial to the interests of the cartmen.
('16', 482, 5, 12, 1086076) We recommend that the period should be restricted to three years where the advance does not exceed Rs. 50, and to a maximum of five years where it exceeds Rs. 50, and that the Planters’ Association should enforce on its members a bye law to this effect.
('16', 482, 7, 13, 1086330) 23. We received some complaints that a few landlords had imposed and retained fines on tenants in particular cases where their own interests were not concerned and no damage of any kind was sustained by them.
('16', 482, 7, 14, 1086539) Such a practice is clearly illegal and the levy of fines, properly so called, should be stopped.
('16', 482, 9, 15, 1086636) 24. The question of pound management in the Champaran district has been brought to our notice.
('16', 482, 9, 16, 1086731) The pounds are largely leased to factories, which has given rise to complaints that they are sometimes used as improper means of coercing raiyats by
('16', 482, 10, 17, 1086880) the impounding of cattle without cause.
('16', 482, 10, 18, 1086920) While it was impossible for us to enquire into and record a finding on individual complaints, the leasing of pounds to landlords may give an opportunity for abuse, and recommend that a trial should be made as an
('16', 483, 0, 1, 1087132) 484 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 483, 1, 2, 1087174) experiment of the direct management of pounds by the District Board.
('16', 483, 2, 3, 1087243) VILLAGE ADMINISTRATION PAPER
('16', 483, 3, 4, 1087272) 25. We have found that there is no authoritative record of village customs such as exists in other provinces of northern India, the procedure followed at settlement for recording various village customs being to make an entry in the village note which does not form part of the Record of Rights.
('16', 483, 3, 5, 1087568) In most provinces, it has been found desirable to make a regular record of such customs and rights.
('16', 483, 3, 6, 1087668) While we recognize that communal village life in Bihar is not so strong as in some other provinces, and that some of the matters such as irrigation rights recorded in these village administration papers are included in the Record of Rights of Bihar, we think that advantage would result from some better authenticated record than the village note of such matters as the right in hides, grazing rights, customs as to house building and the like.
('16', 483, 3, 7, 1088113) We commend the suggestion to the consideration of Government.
('16', 483, 4, 8, 1088175) MISCELLANEOUS
('16', 483, 5, 9, 1088189) 26. There are two final recommendations that we desire to make which are designed to secure that full effect is given to the orders which Government may pass.
('16', 483, 5, 10, 1088348) The first is that such orders as may be passed should be communicated in the vernacular to the raiyats by as wide publication as possible.
('16', 483, 5, 11, 1088487) The second is that it
('16', 483, 6, 12, 1088509) should be impressed on the district staff and especially on the staff of the Court of Wards estates that, until Government is satisfied that full effect has been given to these orders, an important part of their duties will be to see that these orders are carried out.

('16', 487, 14, 13, 1096023) We, the members of the All India Committee of the Indian National Congress and of the Council of the All India Moslem League, welcome you, Sir, His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for India, and approach you and Your Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General, His Imperial Majesty’s august representative and the head of his Government in this country, with feelings of gratitude and hope; gratitude, in that proposals of reform formulated by the National Congress and the Moslem League have received the attention of Your Excellency and of His Imperial Majesty’s Ministers in Great Britain whom you, Sir, represent; hope, in that we feel that our proposals being just and in full harmony with British history and policy, will meet with favour at your hands.
('16', 487, 15, 14, 1096791) Sirs, we cannot let this historic occasion pass without acknowledging the great and good work that Great Britain has accomplished in India.
('16', 487, 15, 15, 1096931) The protection of the land from invasion from without and the establishment of peace and order are in themselves no mean achievements; but it is a prouder title to glory that she has produced a new intellectual awakening a national consciousness and an eager longing for freedom among the heirs of ancient civilization who had unfortunately fallen from

('16', 488, 1, 2, 1097330) their high estate.
('16', 488, 1, 3, 1097349) It was a great truth which Lord Ripon of blessed memory felicitously uttered when he described educated Indians as the children of British Rule, and we can assure you, Sirs, that Sir Bartle Frere’s observation is as correct today as when he made it that no section of the people of India appreciate the advantages of that rule more highly than those whose minds have been broadened by the liberal English education which will for all time stand as Britain’s most imperishable monument in India.

('16', 488, 1, 7, 1098635) The aut horit ative ann ounce ment whi ch was mad e sim ultan eousl y in England and India on the 20th of August last that His Majesty’s Government with the complete accord of the Government of India, accept responsible government for India as an integral part of the Empire as the goal of British policy was therefore received by the country with no ordinary feeling of satisfaction.
('16', 488, 1, 8, 1099020) For that epoch making declaration, Sirs, we Indians of all creeds, classes and communities are deeply beholden to His Majesty’s Government as well as to the Government of India.
('16', 488, 2, 9, 1099198) We submit however that to ensure the early realization of this ideal the reforms
('16', 488, 3, 10, 1099279) that are to be introduced as a first instalment should confer a substantial measure of
('16', 488, 4, 11, 1099366) power on the people acting through their chosen representatives in Councils, and
('16', 488, 5, 12, 1099447) further, that the determination of future progress should not, as has been proposed, be
('16', 488, 6, 13, 1099535) left entirely to the Government in India and England.
('16', 488, 6, 14, 1099589) It ought to be recognized that
('16', 488, 7, 15, 1099620) the people of India themselves, as the party principally affected, have a right to an
('16', 488, 8, 16, 1099706) effective voice in the decision of a question which is of such supreme moment to
('16', 488, 9, 17, 1099787) This would be in conformity with the principle of the declaration recently made
('16', 488, 10, 18, 1099867) by the Prime Minister of England “that the wishes of the inhabitants must be the
('16', 488, 11, 19, 1099948) supreme consideration in the resettlement”, and that this formula “is to be applied
('16', 488, 12, 20, 1100032) equally in the tropical countries”.
('16', 488, 12, 21, 1100068) It is our settled conviction that the best interests of
('16', 488, 13, 22, 1100124) this Country and of the Empire demand that full responsible Government should be
('16', 488, 14, 23, 1100205) established here as early as practicable.
('16', 488, 14, 24, 1100247) We are therefore anxious to be assured that
('16', 488, 15, 25, 1100291) the progress towards the goal shall be reasonably rapid.
('16', 488, 15, 26, 1100348) We hope that this point will
('16', 488, 16, 27, 1100377) be taken into consideration by His Majesty’s Government.
('16', 489, 0, 1, 1100434) 490 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 489, 1, 2, 1100476) We are not less grateful for the decision to introduce a substantial first
('16', 489, 2, 3, 1100551) instalment of reforms at as early a date as may be practicable.
('16', 489, 2, 4, 1100615) We beg leave to
('16', 489, 3, 5, 1100631) observe, Sirs, that the proceedings of the annual sessions of both the Indian National
('16', 489, 4, 6, 1100718) Congress and All India Moslem League are a living proof of the imperative need of
('16', 489, 5, 7, 1100800) liberal reforms in all directions—constitutional, financial and administrative.
('16', 489, 6, 8, 1100880) Amelioration of the material condition of the masses as well as the satisfaction of the
('16', 489, 7, 9, 1100968) political aspirations of the classes has throughout been the anxious concern of these
('16', 489, 8, 10, 1101054) organizations.
('16', 489, 8, 11, 1101069) They have persistently advocated reforms in land revenue policy and
('16', 489, 9, 12, 1101137) administration; measures for the relief of agricultural indebtedness, agricultural
('16', 489, 10, 13, 1101220) education and agricultural improvement; rapid progress in the construction of
('16', 489, 11, 14, 1101298) irrigation works; an active policy of industrial development and technical education;
('16', 489, 12, 15, 1101384) the wider diffusion of education in all its branches; retrenchment of public
('16', 489, 13, 16, 1101461) expenditure and reduction of taxation, pressing heavily on those least able to bear it;
('16', 489, 14, 17, 1101549) reform of the police, and of the system of administration of justice; temperance
('16', 489, 15, 18, 1101630) reform; lenient forest rules; the improvement of public health, and adequate provision
('16', 489, 16, 19, 1101717) of medical relief; the re institution of village Panchayats;—all of which are designed
('16', 489, 17, 20, 1101804) and calculated to make life more worth living for the tens of millions of our poorer
('16', 489, 18, 21, 1101889) countrymen, with whose condition as it is no one can affect to be satisfied.
('16', 489, 18, 22, 1101966) We submit
('16', 489, 19, 23, 1101976) with confidence that educated Indians cannot justly be blamed if the remedial measures
('16', 489, 20, 24, 1102063) for which they have been striving have not been introduced.
('16', 489, 20, 25, 1102123) It is true that they have
('16', 489, 21, 26, 1102149) been claiming with equal ardour the practical recognition of the rights which
('16', 489, 22, 27, 1102227) legitimately are theirs in their own country; but in doing so they have been actuated
('16', 489, 23, 28, 1102313) at least as much by the earnest desire to exercise them in the interest of their less
('16', 489, 24, 29, 1102399) favoured brethren as by the prompting of their own national self respect.
('16', 489, 24, 30, 1102473) If they have
('16', 489, 25, 31, 1102486) insistently pleaded for some measure of real power for the representatives and
('16', 489, 26, 32, 1102565) spokesmen of the people in the government of the country, if they have declined to
('16', 489, 27, 33, 1102648) reconcile themselves to a position of subordination and inferiority in administration,
('16', 489, 28, 34, 1102735) if they have pressed for the removal of all disabilities and distinction based on racial
('16', 489, 29, 35, 1102824) and religious grounds, if they have expressed their dissatisfaction with the share
('16', 489, 30, 36, 1102907) assigned to them in the defence of the country, and if they have protested against
('16', 489, 31, 37, 1102990) reactionary and repressive measures, they have done so because the assertion of their
('16', 489, 32, 38, 1103076) rights as Indians is to them a compelling public duty.
('16', 489, 32, 39, 1103131) Neither the National Congress
('16', 489, 33, 40, 1103161) nor the Moslem League has ever been slow to acknowledge the value of the
('16', 489, 34, 41, 1103234) progressive measures that have been adopted by Government from time to time.
('16', 489, 35, 42, 1103311) we may therefore be permitted to say with the less hesitation that the experience of
('16', 489, 36, 43, 1103396) years has convinced us that under the existing system social and economic reform has
('16', 489, 37, 44, 1103481) much less chance than the well being and advancement of the people demands, that

('16', 490, 1, 2, 1103608) Indian public opinion is more powerless than effectual, service and sectional
('16', 490, 2, 3, 1103686) interests are not always subordinated to the common weal, and that the system should
('16', 490, 3, 4, 1103771) be so altered as to make the will of the people prevail as far as may be in all matters of
('16', 490, 4, 5, 1103862) internal administration.
('16', 490, 5, 6, 1103887) ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF SCHEME
('16', 490, 6, 7, 1103916) It is in this conviction, Sirs, that the National Congress and the Moslem League considered the constitutional and administrative reforms which they should respectfully urge on the Government here and in England for present adoption.
('16', 490, 6, 8, 1104150) The Joint Scheme of Reforms is the result of careful deliberation of joint conferences of their committees.
('16', 490, 6, 9, 1104258) It may be mentioned here that the Memorandum which was submitted to Your Excellency by nineteen elected members of Your Excellency’s Legislative Council in the autumn of 1916 is in accord with the proposals of the Congress and the League.
('16', 490, 6, 10, 1104497) We now ask permission, Sirs, to dwell on what may be regarded as the essential features of the Scheme of Reforms.
('16', 490, 6, 11, 1104611) The basal principles on which it is founded are, firstly, that the British connection with India should be safeguarded, and secondly, that, subject to this fundamental reservation the character and constitution of the Government of India and the Provincial Governments should be transformed so as to make them representative of and responsible to the people acting through their elected representatives in Councils.
('16', 490, 6, 12, 1105027) To the former end it is proposed that the Government of India should continue to own responsibility to His Maj esty’s Gov ernme nt, and thr ough the m to the Bri tish Par lia ment, in mat ters pertaining to foreign relations and the defence of the country.
('16', 490, 6, 13, 1105284) The Legislature is to have no control over them.
('16', 490, 6, 14, 1105333) Nor will it have any right to interfere with the relations of the Government with the Indian States.
('16', 490, 6, 15, 1105434) This being secured, it is urged that in matters of internal administration the control of the Secretary of State should be replaced by control by the Legislature; the Government of India similarly devolving power on the provincial Governments, which in their turn will own responsibility to their respective Legislatures.
('16', 490, 6, 16, 1105756) It must obviously follow that there should be a strong Indian element in the Executive Governments as well as that the Legislative Councils should be expanded and reformed so as to consist of a substantial majority of members elected directly by the people on as wide a franchise as may be possible.
('16', 490, 6, 17, 1106056) And these Councils should be endowed with real and substantial power, not only over legislation but also over finance and administration.
('16', 490, 6, 18, 1106194) We venture to think that the Congress and the Moslem League make no extravagant proposals when they ask that one half of the Executive Councillors should be Indians, and that four fifths of the Legislative Councils should consist of elected members.
('16', 490, 6, 19, 1106444) Nor, we submit, are the powers proposed for the latter bodies excessive or impracticable.
('16', 490, 6, 20, 1106534) Adequate safeguards have been provided in the Scheme to prevent the adoption of hasty or unsuitable measures— legislative, financial or administrative; as well as to protect the interests of minorities.
('16', 490, 6, 21, 1106737) In connection with the latter point we beg to invite attention to the provision that no non official proposal affecting communal interests to which three fourths of the members belonging to that community object, should be proceeded with in any Legislative Council.
('16', 491, 0, 1, 1107003) 492 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 491, 1, 2, 1107045) The reforms relating to the Secretary of State and his Council are suggested as being consequential on the reform of the system of government in the country itself.
('16', 491, 1, 3, 1107210) They will, it is trusted, be found to make for economy and for harmony between the authorities in the two countries, without in any way impairing efficiency.
('16', 491, 2, 4, 1107368) In the Memora ndum in suppor t of the propos als, which we beg to hand with this addres s, the case for reform is set forth at some length .
('16', 491, 2, 5, 1107509) It discus ses, too, the import ant cognat e subjec t of local self g overnment and a few urgent ly needed admini strative reform s for the introd uction of which both the Congre ss and the League have long been earnes tly appeal ing to Govern ment.
('16', 491, 2, 6, 1107758) The resolu tions of the Congre ss and the Moslem League , the Joint Scheme of Reform s, and the memora ndum of the ninete en member s, are append ed to our Memora ndum to facili tate refere nce.
('16', 491, 2, 7, 1107953) We hope that the countr y will not have to wait longer to see Lord Ripon’s cheris hed scheme of real local self g overnment fully carrie d out; or for the substa ntial Indian ization of the public servic es for which our late revere d countr yman, Mr. Dadabh oy Naoroj i, labour ed so long and so hard; or for the comple te separa tion of the judici al servic es and functi ons from the execut ive, a reform needed even more in the intere st of he backwa rd masses s than of the classe s; or for such an amendm ent of the Arms Act and Rules as will not only do away with the invidi ous racial discri mination agains t Indian s but empower them to possess and carry arms on conditions similar to those which prevail in other civilized countries, in most of the States in this very country, and in the case of Europeans and Americans in British India itself.
('16', 491, 2, 8, 1108810) The country has expressed its gratification at the removal of the bar against the appointment of Indians as commissioned officers in the Army.
('16', 491, 2, 9, 1108953) It trusts that the rules which will regulate their admission will be liberal and open an honourable and patriotic career to the young men of all classes who may satisfy such tests as may be imposed to judge their fitness, that the requisite facilities for their training and examination will be provided in India itself, and that lndians will be appointed in reasonably large numbers.
('16', 491, 2, 10, 1109338) It is a grievance of long standing that Indians are not permitted to enlist as volunteers.
('16', 491, 2, 11, 1109429) If, however, the system of volunteering as it has existed is to disappear, it is believed that the Indian Defence Force will not be disbanded after the war, and it is urged that the Indian section of it may be placed on a level of absolute equality with the European.
('16', 491, 3, 12, 1109697) INDIA’S STATUS IN THE EMPIRE
('16', 491, 4, 13, 1109726) Before taking leave of you, Sirs, we would invite attention to the very important subject of India’s status in the Empire.
('16', 491, 4, 14, 1109849) Our claim in one word is that she should be lifted from the position of a dependency to that of equalitlity with the Dominions.
('16', 491, 4, 15, 1109977) The relation of the two should be mutual in the complete sense of the term.
('16', 491, 4, 16, 1110053) We submit that if the Dominions are to exercise any rights in relation to India, the latter should have the power to exercise the same rights in relation to them.

('16', 492, 1, 2, 1110262) any Council or Parliament of the Empire which may be constituted at a future date, India should be represented in like manner and in an equal measure with the Dominions.
('16', 492, 1, 3, 1110432) Unless this is done, the participation of the Dominions in the governance of our country, without a corresponding right in us to participate in the governance of them, will mean a lowering of even our present unsatisfactory status, which will arouse the strongest opposition in this country.
('16', 492, 1, 4, 1110724) We hope and trust that His Majesty’s Government will never entertain any such proposal.
('16', 492, 1, 5, 1110812) In the meantime we re quest that India may be allowed to be represented in the Imperial Conference (and in the Imperial Cabinet if any such should be constituted) through persons elected by the elected members of our Legislative Councils.
('16', 492, 1, 6, 1111051) We are beholden to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India for the privilege accorded to India in the beginning of this year, of sending three gentlemen to represent her in the Imperial War Conference and the Imperial War Cabinet.
('16', 492, 1, 7, 1111295) Nor are we less sensible of the value of the unanimous resolution recorded by the former body in favour of the regular representation of India at future ordinary sittings of the Imperial Conference.
('16', 492, 1, 8, 1111494) The consti tutional positi on of the Govern ment of India being what it is in relati on to His Majest y’s Govern ment on the one side and the people of India on the other, its nomine es cannot have the charac ter of repres entatives or spokes men of the people, as have the Ministers of the Dominions, which are endowed with responsible government.
('16', 492, 1, 9, 1111843) In this view of the matter we are constrained to submit that during the period of transition from the existing system to responsible government, the representatives of this country in the Imperial Conference and the Imperial Cabinet should be allowed to be elected by the elected members of the Legislative Councils in India.

('16', 498, 2, 3, 1124803) EXTRACT FROM J.T. WHITTY’S LETTER TO L. F. MORSHEAD
('16', 498, 3, 4, 1124855) [BETTIAH,
('16', 498, 4, 5, 1124865) November 17, 1917]
('16', 498, 5, 6, 1124884) It is a fact that very exaggerated ideas as regards Mr. Gandhi’s position are held by the raiyats, but I hear it on good authority that in cases where he has given directions of which the raiyats disapprove they have refused to obey him.
('16', 498, 5, 7, 1125122) I am told for instance that in the Turkaulia Dehat when Mr. Gandhi advised the raiyats that they should pay Sharahbeshi less the 20 per cent
('16', 498, 6, 8, 1125263) agreed on they said definitely that they would do no such thing and are now saying “Who is Gandhi?”
('16', 498, 7, 9, 1125363) Two days ago Mr. Gandhi wrote 1 to me to say that he had a number of enquiries from the raiyats as to why enhancement suits in villages where Tawan had been taken
('16', 498, 8, 10, 1125526) were still going on although no enhancement was to be taken for seven years.
('16', 498, 8, 11, 1125603) It struck me that the enquiry showed an extraordinary lack of knowledge of the law on the subject and the position generally.
('16', 498, 8, 12, 1125729) Obviously we are not going to withdraw our cases as we merely intend to remit the enhancement for seven years but must have it recorded as legal rent and in any case we have as yet no reliable information as to the raiyats who have actually paid Tawan.
('16', 498, 9, 13, 1125982) I replied to Mr. Gandhi that he was under a misapprehension which I should be glad to explain to him if he would call on me but that at the same time I wished to point out that the raiyats had not been to me and that I did not approve of having an
('16', 498, 10, 14, 1126230) intermediary in matters which I can deal with myself.
('16', 498, 11, 15, 1126284) His reply was to the effect that he could not understand Government Offi cers refusing the assistance of public men who are in closer touch with theraiyats
('16', 498, 12, 16, 1126440) than they could hope to be when both were working with the same object.
('16', 498, 12, 17, 1126512) He said he did not wish to come and see me on sufferance.
('16', 498, 13, 18, 1126570) I replied that the matter in which he had intervened between me and my tenants was one of no difficulty whatever, [one] on which I required no assistance from any outsiders and that I objected to the introduction of an intermediary which prevented me from being in direct touch with my own tenants.
('16', 498, 13, 19, 1126869) Mr. Gandhi refused to admit that his intervention was not justified, but expressed his wish to see me as regards his education policy.
('16', 498, 14, 20, 1127004) 1 The correspondence referred to in this letter is not available.
('16', 499, 0, 1, 1127070) 500 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 499, 1, 2, 1127112) I saw him and had a long talk with him and discussed the various points raised in the Commission’s report.
('16', 499, 2, 3, 1127219) As always in conversation I found him generally very reasonable.
('16', 499, 2, 4, 1127284) He expressed regret at the sudden breaking up of indigo cultivation.
('16', 499, 2, 5, 1127353) His own view was that some time might have been given.
('16', 499, 2, 6, 1127408) He told me that the refusal to pay rent is due to the stupidity of the raiyats who misinterpreted the orders passed.
('16', 499, 2, 7, 1127525) Whenever they
('16', 499, 3, 8, 1127539) came to him he explained to them that they must pay rent as usual.
('16', 499, 3, 9, 1127606) His own wish he says now is to utilize his position and any gratitude which he has earned from the raiyats to introduce sanitary ideas and improve agricultural methods.
('16', 499, 3, 10, 1127775) He wishes to
('16', 499, 4, 11, 1127788) improve the relations of planters and their tenants as far as it is in his power to do so.
('16', 499, 5, 12, 1127879) He approved of the action of his lieutenant in going out to enquire into the alleged disturbance in Ammon’s dehat, in which the police were said to be
('16', 499, 6, 13, 1128030) implicated, and this being so he would no doubt be prepared to make similar enquiries if asked to do so by the raiyats.
('16', 499, 7, 14, 1128150) I still consider that Mr. Gandhi himself is disinterested in his ultimate motives, but in order to strengthen and secure his position he has to make use of methods and instruments which are sure to become a danger to the peace of the district.
('16', 499, 8, 15, 1128394) As regards the non payment of rent and the interference with landlords’ admitted rights, he would certainly be on the side of the law and would advise the raiyats accordingly.
('16', 499, 8, 16, 1128570) To this extent at the present time his presence in the district is
('16', 499, 9, 17, 1128637) likely to do good rather than harm.
('16', 499, 9, 18, 1128673) At the same time he must be a continued centre of agitation.
('16', 499, 9, 19, 1128734) He has not been accepted as an arbitrator who will be fair to the interests of all parties, but as a champion of the raiyats against the Planters and it will be
('16', 499, 10, 20, 1128895) impossible for him to avoid being a storm centre.
('16', 499, 11, 21, 1128945) Yours sincerely,

('16', 500, 8, 9, 1129276) I am interested to hear of your attempt to found schools.
('16', 500, 8, 10, 1129334) I shall be glad to hear more about this, regarding the class of schools you propose to open, and the type of education to be imparted.
('16', 500, 8, 11, 1129469) Also the places where you open them.
('16', 500, 9, 12, 1129506) With regard to your letter of 17th instant about the matter of certain ryots’ complaints that they had been compelled to sign certain documents.
('16', 500, 9, 13, 1129651) they are at liberty to go to the court if they think they have been victimized.
('16', 500, 10, 14, 1129731) I am quite unable to listen to any observations in a case which is before the courts, which might tend to prejudice the merit of the court .
('16', 500, 10, 15, 1129872) I am glad therefore that you do not intend to impart your observations to me regarding a case brought by Sheoratan Nonia.

('16', 500, 14, 19, 1130065) November 24, 1917
('16', 500, 15, 20, 1130083) DEA R MR. MORS HEAD,
('16', 500, 16, 21, 1130104) My fortnightly confidential report.
('16', 500, 17, 22, 1130140) The general situation gets no easier, rather the reverse.
('16', 500, 17, 23, 1130198) I regret to report that the recent Government vernacular notice appears to have tended to increase its difficulty.

('16', 500, 19, 26, 1130513) 9. Mr. Gandhi is again with us, though he has just written to inform me that he is going away for a fortnight.
('16', 500, 19, 27, 1130624) I informed you of the interview I had with him on 9th November 1917. He has been very active since his arrival early in the month.
('16', 500, 19, 28, 1130755) He has started founding schools at the following places:
('16', 501, 0, 1, 1130812) 502 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 501, 1, 2, 1130854) (1) Barharwa ne Dhaka—in charge of Mr. and Mrs. Gokhalay, the latter being a “trained nurse and midwife”.

('16', 501, 3, 7, 1131134) (3) Belwa, P. S. Shikarpur, near Belwa Factory.
('16', 501, 4, 8, 1131182) I solicit instructions as to the attitude to be adopted to Mr. Gandhi and his schools and hygienic propaganda.
('16', 501, 4, 9, 1131293) Am I to encourage him in his work before satisfying myself of its character, or am I to adopt a neutral attitude.
('16', 501, 5, 10, 1131407) I am not prepared as yet to make any comments either on the nature of the instruction given by him or on the character of his followers.
('16', 501, 5, 11, 1131544) I know nothing about them.
('16', 501, 5, 12, 1131571) Personally I think that if they are genuinely interested in the matter they profess, they will soon get sick of trying to teach hygiene to the Bihari cultivator.
('16', 501, 5, 13, 1131733) Mr. Gandhi has been trying to get subscriptions for his schools, but has been met with a very modified enthusiasm from local Indians in this respect.
('16', 501, 6, 14, 1131883) 10. Similarly I would like instructions as to my attitude with regard to Mr. Gandhi’s other activities He is not confining himself to hygienic and educational matters only.
('16', 501, 6, 15, 1132056) He has been making personal enquiries at Belwa (the place at which he has also founded a school) concerning the recent case brought by Sheoratan Nonia v.
('16', 501, 7, 16, 1132210) Mr. Ammon of Belwa Factory, in connection with which I reported the conduct of Babu Janakdhari Prasad in my official letter of the 27th October last.
('16', 501, 7, 17, 1132360) Mr. Gandhi has offered to make “observations” on the case to me after it has been judicially decided.
('16', 501, 7, 18, 1132462) He has also been enquiring into the question of some agreements executed by the raiyats of the Seeraha Factory.
('16', 501, 7, 19, 1132574) I learn from Mr. Ammon that at Belwa Mr. Gandhi
('16', 501, 8, 20, 1132622) held a kind of formal enquiry, and took the depositions of complainant and some witnesses.
('16', 501, 9, 21, 1132713) As a public officer, I presume, I should welcome friendly assistance from outside.
('16', 501, 9, 22, 1132796) At the same time the practice of independent enquiries into cases actually pending before the course appears to me to be open to grave abuses, especially when the people concerned are, as in Champaran, ignorant, ill balanced and prone to untruthfulness.
('16', 501, 9, 23, 1133050) Mr. Gandhi himself, quite possibly with justice, claims to be wholly impartial, but the impartiality of many of his assistants is open to suspicion, and I consider them be not above “doctoring” a case to suit themselves.
('16', 501, 9, 24, 1133271) Mr. Gandhi has, I believe, previously given assurance that he would only interfere in cases where he believed the raiyats had been clearly victimized.
('16', 501, 9, 25, 1133422) But I submit that Mr. Gandhi’s
('16', 501, 10, 26, 1133453) judgment is fallible.
('16', 501, 10, 27, 1133475) It appears to be quite impossible to make such distinction between cases.
('16', 501, 10, 28, 1133549) The practice must be countenanced in all cases or in none.
('16', 501, 10, 29, 1133608) I ask for guidance on this point.

('16', 502, 1, 4, 1133905) 2577C 1571/II of 1917, dated 20th July, 1917, to Heycock, instructed Heycock to inform Mr. Gandhi that he (Heycock) was ‘‘not aware of the attitude Government will adopt towards the importation of “volunteers”.
('16', 502, 1, 5, 1134116) May I now enquire if Government will communicate to me their attitude?
('16', 502, 2, 6, 1134187) Yours sincerely,

('16', 502, 5, 10, 1134282) November 27, 1917
('16', 502, 6, 11, 1134300) There are three factors just now tending to upset raiyats in the Division,
('16', 502, 7, 12, 1134375) namely, Home Rule propaganda, Gandhi’s activities, and the tension between Hindus and Mahomedans: These react upon each other to upset the raiyats’ minds and
('16', 502, 8, 13, 1134533) promote a disregard of law and authority.
('16', 502, 8, 14, 1134575) As already reported, village to village Home
('16', 502, 9, 15, 1134620) Rule meetings are being held in Saran, and are said to have encouraged the incident at
('16', 502, 10, 16, 1134707) Sipahiya; and, in combination with Gandhi’s influence, to be stirring up trouble with
('16', 502, 11, 17, 1134793) the Maniara concern in Gopalganj.
('16', 502, 12, 18, 1134827) Merriman’s letter will show that the refusal to pay rent is becoming serious in
('16', 502, 13, 19, 1134907) Champaran, and that labour troubles are not settled.
('16', 502, 13, 20, 1134960) He asks for instructions as to his
('16', 502, 14, 21, 1134995) attitude towards Gandhi, especially in regard to his educational schemes and his
('16', 502, 15, 22, 1135076) importation of volunteers.
('16', 502, 15, 23, 1135103) I have not, however, had time to consider his letter
('16', 502, 16, 24, 1135156) properly.

('16', 502, 18, 26, 1135201) November 27, 1917
('16', 502, 19, 27, 1135219) I understand Sir William Vincent is coming here in a day or two and I think it
('16', 502, 20, 28, 1135298) might clear the air if H. H. and the two H.Ms.
('16', 502, 20, 29, 1135345) could see him together and point out the
('16', 502, 21, 30, 1135386) state of affairs in the District and ask how far the Government of India is prepared to
('16', 502, 22, 31, 1135474) The only effective action that I can see is to get Mr. Gandhi to promise to leave
('16', 502, 23, 32, 1135556) the District absolutely alone for six months or a year at least.
('16', 502, 23, 33, 1135621) If he really does that
('16', 502, 24, 34, 1135644) there is some chance of things settling down.
('16', 502, 24, 35, 1135690) As long as his name and personality
('16', 502, 25, 36, 1135726) keep bobbing up there is no chance of things settling.
('16', 502, 25, 37, 1135781) If we appeal to Mr. Gandhi to
('16', 502, 26, 38, 1135811) give the District a chance and he refuses or does not do so, how far will the
('16', 502, 27, 39, 1135889) Government of India back us up if we have to resort to compulsion?
('16', 502, 27, 40, 1135956) Sir W. Vincent
('16', 502, 28, 41, 1135971) will not of course be able to give us any absolute pledge, but he may be able to give
('16', 502, 29, 42, 1136057) us a glimpse into the mind of the Government of India which we do not possess.

('16', 503, 2, 3, 1136223) November 28, 1917
('16', 503, 3, 4, 1136241) CHI EF SE CRETA RY,
('16', 503, 4, 5, 1136261) Mr. Reid told me yesterday he had heard from Messrs Norman and Hill that all is quiet in their dehats and that Mr. Gandhi has helped to bring refractory raiyats to
('16', 503, 5, 6, 1136425) reason.
('16', 503, 5, 7, 1136433) He says, however, that considerable unrest is now spreading into Muzaffarpur, owing, it is stated, to the distribution there of the leaflets issued in Muzaffarpur district stating that these leaflets have no reference to that district and concern Champaran only.
('16', 503, 6, 8, 1136696) The Maharani of Hathwa also told me this morning that there is a tendency in Saran for the raiyats to withhold their rents because of the unrest caused by Mr.
('16', 503, 7, 9, 1136855) Gandhi and the Home Rule propaganda.
('16', 503, 7, 10, 1136892) It is worth couidering whether it would not be well to issue proclamation to the raiyats enjoining the payment of their lawful rents,
('16', 503, 8, 11, 1137026) and pointing out that they will themselves be the sufferers if they withhold payment.

('16', 503, 11, 15, 1137177) December 2, 1917
('16', 503, 12, 16, 1137194) In considering the situation in Champaran we have also to consider the disquieting reports received from other districts north of the river, particularly those from Chapra.
('16', 503, 12, 17, 1137367) There can be no doubt that a wave of unrest has passed through the districts of Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga and Saran.
('16', 503, 12, 18, 1137481) This wave undoubtedly started with Mr. Gandhi’s advent.
('16', 503, 12, 19, 1137537) That there was discontent in Champaran there can be no question but with Mr. Gandhi’s advent the attitude of the raiyats underwent a change for the worse.
('16', 503, 13, 20, 1137692) Rumours of what Mr. Gandhi was going to do spread throughout the districts named and we know it for a fact that raiyats from all districts went to Mr. Gandhi with their
('16', 503, 14, 21, 1137861) grievances.
('16', 503, 14, 22, 1137873) At the time not much attention appears to have been paid to the complaints from other districts but the general impression amongst the raiyats of
('16', 503, 15, 23, 1138019) other districts seems to be that, Mr. Gandhi, when he has done with Champaran, will take up the cause in other districts; in fact our latest information is that, speaking at recent meeting at Muzaffarpur, he promised that later on the tenants of that district would also enjoy the benefits that he, by his efforts, had secured for Champaran.
('16', 503, 15, 24, 1138361) In these circumstances it is not surprising that the simple folk should in Mr. Gandhi recognize someone all powerful.
('16', 503, 15, 25, 1138479) Whatever Mr. Gandhi’s intentions may be, and l am willing to believe they are well meant, the fact remains that he is accompanied by a number of undesirables who are making use of his name to stir up trouble.
('16', 503, 15, 26, 1138688) If Mr. Gandhi’s speeches have been correctly reported, they are calculated toencourage disaffection.
('16', 503, 15, 27, 1138789) Such statements as he wished to see tenants partners with the planters and not slaves, that “the interests of the Hindus lay in trying to stop the wholesale
('16', 504, 0, 1, 1138946) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 505
('16', 504, 1, 2, 1138992) slaughter of cows” appear curious statements for this gentleman to make at the present time, if, as he professes, he is trying to allay unrest.
('16', 504, 1, 3, 1139136) His action in making enquiries into cases that are sub judice almost amounts to contempt of court and
('16', 504, 2, 4, 1139238) certainly lowers the prestige of the local officials.
('16', 504, 2, 5, 1139292) I have no hesitation in saying Mr. Gandhi’s presence is undesirable at the present time.
('16', 504, 2, 6, 1139381) (g) EXTRACT FROM H. McPHERSON’S LETTER TO SECRETARY, HOME DEPARTMENT
('16', 504, 3, 7, 1139450) December 6, 1917
('16', 504, 4, 8, 1139467) Mr. Gandhi’s continued presence in Champaran is a difficult factor in the situation.
('16', 504, 4, 9, 1139552) His objects are doubtless sincere, and he is said to be striving for peace and to have worked with success in certain case to attain this end in co operation with the more responsible planters.
('16', 504, 4, 10, 1139746) His politics, however, are not within the comprehension of the ordinary cultivator, and the actions of the satellites, with whom he is surrounded, are not in all cases inspired with his own honesty of purpose.
('16', 504, 4, 11, 1139956) Mr. Gandhi is a prominent exponent of Home Rule, and the “monster” petition for which signatures are being collected throughout the mofussil was drafted by him.
('16', 504, 5, 12, 1140117) There are other development of Mr. Gandhi’s work which, however well intentioned they may be, are liable to be misunderstood by the raiyats.
('16', 504, 5, 13, 1140258) His activities
('16', 504, 6, 14, 1140273) extend to the foundation of schools where instruction is imparted by educated teachers from Bombay and to the investigation by him and his followers of cases which are being inquired into by the police.
('16', 504, 6, 15, 1140476) Enough is not yet known of his schools and teachers to say what sort of ideas they are instilling into the minds of their pupils, but it is certain that his interference in criminal cases is a cause of embarrassment to the local police and magistracy.

('16', 504, 12, 21, 1140857) MY DEAR MR. G ANDHI ,
('16', 504, 13, 22, 1140879) You would have arrived at Motihari by the time this reaches you and would like to know how the work here is progressing.
('16', 504, 14, 23, 1141000) Since you were here last, we have been able to put almost all the wells in the village in order by removing the drains which being so close to the wells were polluting the drinking water.
('16', 504, 14, 24, 1141188) In one or two case, it was a difficult task as a drain from

('16', 505, 1, 2, 1141290) the house could not be diverted unless it passed through a neighbour’s property which we managed to divert by appealing to the kindly feeling of the neighbour.
('16', 505, 1, 3, 1141450) In the other case, we had to take assistance of the elders of the village to use some persuasion.
('16', 505, 1, 4, 1141548) Anyhow we have achieved our object.
('16', 505, 2, 5, 1141584) We are now after them for committing nuisance quite close to their house.
('16', 505, 2, 6, 1141658) This we propose to effect through an elderly Mahomedan preaching against [it at] their usual Friday gathering.
('16', 505, 2, 7, 1141769) We propose to adopt a similar course for the Hindus.
('16', 505, 2, 8, 1141822) l think in the course of a few weeks we shall be able to see good results.
('16', 505, 2, 9, 1141897) In the meantime, we have managed to convince the people that there is no loss of prestige in at least covering the faeces with earth by doing it ourselves for them.
('16', 505, 2, 10, 1142062) You will be glad to know that people have now taken to it.
('16', 505, 3, 11, 1142121) As for the schools, the number of students has gone up to over 75. The average daily attendance for the last month was over 60. The boys seem to take great delight in learning their songs and also the new outdoor games that are taught to them after their usual drill.
('16', 505, 3, 12, 1142389) Mrs. Gokhalay visits the village in the neighbourhood almost daily as there is always a female patient requiring medical aid.
('16', 505, 4, 13, 1142515) When the people have gathered their harvest we intend to call them in the evenings and address them on the subjects of hygiene and general culture.
('16', 505, 5, 14, 1142663) Dr. Deva called here last Wednesday and stayed over a day as there are many patients whom we could not have attended.
('16', 505, 5, 15, 1142781) We cannot get his prescriptions dispensed in Dhaka Dispensary and we shall have to apply to higher authorities to make special case and have them dispensed, which would greatly help the poor folk in the neighbourhood but before that we intend to see Hospital Assistant in Dhaka.

('16', 506, 6, 9, 1143915) I have however been told that you would be willing to raise a labour corps.
('16', 506, 6, 10, 1143991) Will you kindly
('16', 506, 7, 11, 1144007) let me know if this is the case, and if so whether you are still willing to do so, and what, if any, conditions you wish to attach.
('16', 506, 7, 12, 1144139) If you wish any force you raise to be a self contained unit and not drafts to existing units, it will be necessary for me to address Army Headquarters.
('16', 506, 7, 13, 1144291) On the other hand if you do not want to go yourself and could assist us in obtaining men for the railway training depot at Gaya, where we need 500 a month, your assistance will be much appreciated.
('16', 506, 7, 14, 1144489) Kindly address your reply to me at Ranchi.

('16', 506, 15, 22, 1144694) MY DEAR MR. G ANDHI ,
('16', 506, 16, 23, 1144716) Thanks for your letter of the 15th.
('16', 506, 16, 24, 1144752) I note our requirements which you will see are at present limited to drafts for existing units.
('16', 506, 16, 25, 1144848) There is no intention at present of raising a fresh Labour Corps.
('16', 506, 17, 26, 1144914) We need men for Mesopotamia or for the Railway Training Depots at Gaya and Puri whence after 2 or 3 months’ training they would be despatched to Basra.
('16', 506, 17, 27, 1145066) We give an advance of Rs. 30. The men get Rs. 15 p.m.
('16', 506, 17, 28, 1145120) while in India and Rs. 20 when overseas.
('16', 506, 17, 29, 1145161) Rs. 3 capitation fee is paid for each man brought in.
('16', 506, 18, 30, 1145215) Cannot you in the course of your tours point out the great economic opportunity now offered?
('16', 506, 18, 31, 1145308) If one man from household goes he can remit Rs. 8 p.

('16', 507, 2, 3, 1145528) Labourers must be over 20 and under 35, really physically strong.
('16', 507, 2, 4, 1145594) If you can help us in recruiting such men you will not only be doing something towards the war but benefiting the people in whom you are taking personal interest.
('16', 507, 2, 5, 1145757) Three or four lakhs of rupees have been paid out in the Sandal Parganas to the great discomfiture of the mahajan or oppressive landlord.
('16', 507, 3, 6, 1145894) If you want to raise a corps of army bearers yourself and will let me know how many you could get I will send on your proposal to Army Headquarters.

('16', 507, 8, 12, 1146150) (a) LETTER FROM L. F. MORSHEAD
('16', 507, 9, 13, 1146181) MOTIHARI,
('16', 507, 10, 14, 1146191) January 14, 1918
('16', 507, 11, 15, 1146208) DEA R MR. GAND HI,
('16', 507, 12, 16, 1146227) In connection with the Champaran Agrarian Bill, I pointed out to the Government that the first clause of section 3, as at present drafted, prohibits khuski agreements, as hitherto understood, no less than tinkathia, because the forra of satta
('16', 507, 13, 17, 1146470) approved by the Planters’ Association contains a stipulation as to the area to be cultivated in order to supply the produce to be paid for by weight.
('16', 507, 14, 18, 1146620) I have had a letter in reply to say that in the opinion of Government there is nothing in section 5 of the Bill to render invalid a khuski satta of the kind hitherto
('16', 507, 15, 19, 1146786) approved, but section 3 would render invalid the penalty for breach of such contract by liquidated damages.
('16', 507, 15, 20, 1146894) Prima facie there is no objection to an agreement to grow indigo on two bighas or, I suppose, any other portion of land provided that the raiyat
('16', 507, 16, 21, 1147039) has entire freedom to select the actual plots to be cultivated, and it was apparently the intention of the Agrarian Committee that the existing system of khuski should be
('16', 507, 17, 22, 1147210) allowed to continue subject to that proviso.
('16', 507, 18, 23, 1147255) I have been accordingly requested to ascertain the views of the raiyats and
('16', 507, 19, 24, 1147331) their representatives both on this point and as to the most suitable way of modifying clause 3, so as not to interfere with khuski sattas.
('16', 507, 20, 25, 1147470) We discussed the matter this morning, and I put before you Mr. Kennedy’s amendment, which is as follows:
('16', 508, 0, 1, 1147575) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 509
('16', 508, 1, 2, 1147621) From the Ist October, 1917, any right, servitude or other interest notwithstanding, all lands within the district of Champaran shall be held by the tenant thereof free from any incident of tenure whereby such tenant is burdened with the obligation to grow any crop for the convenience of his landlord on his land or any part thereof and any previous act or acts permitting such as an incidence of tenure are hereby expressly repealed.
('16', 508, 2, 3, 1148056) Any agreement, contract or hypothecation whereby a tenant agrees, contracts with or hypothecates to his landlord the crop grown on his holding or any part thereof shall be void as regards such condition save the holding or part of the holding be specially defined in such agreement, contract or hypothecation.
('16', 508, 3, 4, 1148366) l understand that you take exception to the second portion of this amendment, which I mark B, but thought that the first portion alone, which I mark A, would be acceptable.
('16', 508, 3, 5, 1148539) Will you kindly let me know if I may inform Government accordingly ?
('16', 508, 3, 6, 1148608) They are anxious to have a reply before the meeting of the Select Committee on the 19th.
('16', 508, 3, 7, 1148697) Could you oblige me with a reply before that date?
('16', 508, 3, 8, 1148748) I shall be in camp at Ramgarhwa on the 15th and 16th and at Chainpatya on the 17th and 18th.
('16', 508, 4, 9, 1148841) Yours sincerely

('16', 508, 7, 12, 1148915) CAMP RAMGARHWA,
('16', 508, 8, 13, 1148931) January 16, 1918
('16', 508, 9, 14, 1148948) MY DEAR COUPL AND,
('16', 508, 10, 15, 1148967) Heycock and I saw Mr. Gandhi at Motihari on the 14th on the subject.
('16', 508, 10, 16, 1149036) I pointed out to Mr. Gandhi that the first clause of section 3 prohibits khuski, as
('16', 508, 11, 17, 1149120) hitherto understood and approved by the Committee in paragraph 8 of their report, no less than tinkathia.
('16', 508, 11, 18, 1149226) Under that system a raiyat agrees to grow indigo usually in
('16', 508, 12, 19, 1149286) consideration of an advance.
('16', 508, 12, 20, 1149315) He offers land which the concern approves before giving an advance, and is paid on the produce.
('16', 508, 13, 21, 1149411) For purpos es of discus sion I took the Rajpor e system , as I unders tand Mr. Sly an d Mr .
('16', 508, 13, 22, 1149504) Ga nd hi ha d ex am ine d th is sy st em at Ra jp ore an d we re sa ti sfi ed wi th it .
('16', 508, 13, 23, 1149593) Gandhi raised an object ion that if the raiyat failed to grow the plots
('16', 508, 14, 24, 1149665) agreed upon, he would be liable to a suit for specif ic perfor mance of the contra ct and liquid ated damage s; and so he would be, of course , if he took the advanc e and did not fulfil his part of the agreem ent and damage result ed.
('16', 509, 0, 1, 1149901) 510 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 509, 1, 2, 1149943) Mr. Gandhi explained that the Bill was drafted in order to save khuski agreements
('16', 509, 2, 3, 1150025) which otherwise were held in accordance with the opinion of Sir S. P. Sinha to be barred under the Tenancy Act.
('16', 509, 2, 4, 1150137) I then suggested that they might be left to the operation of the Tenancy Act, which at any rate would leave the khuski
('16', 509, 3, 5, 1150256) system in the position in which it stands now, whereas the Bill prohibits it contrary to the Committee’s intention.
('16', 509, 3, 6, 1150372) In order to focus the discussion I showed him Mr. Kennedy’s amendment, and asked if he approved of the first part of it, which confines the new legislation to the prohibition of tinkathia as a condition of tenancy.
('16', 509, 4, 7, 1150587) reading it he declared himself ready to accept the first part of it as a solution.
('16', 509, 4, 8, 1150670) I told him that I did not wish to ‘shoot him sitting’ and he had better think it over.
('16', 509, 4, 9, 1150757) I then wrote the attached letter, and enclose a copy of his reply.
('16', 509, 5, 10, 1150824) I do not myself believe that Mr. Gandhi represents the raiyats.
('16', 509, 5, 11, 1150888) So long as there is no compulsion they are competent to understand their own interests, and they both have been and are willing to grow indigo on the khuski system in Saran, where there is no tinkathia as well as in Champaran and Muzaffarpur a leading advantage of it being that if they require a fairly substantial advance to pay off a mahajan or the like they can get it.
('16', 509, 5, 12, 1151262) They will, however, lose this if they are not allowed to agree upon, at any rate, the description of land to be sown.
('16', 509, 5, 13, 1151380) It might be necessary to stipulate that the rent accounts must be kept entirely separate, but to go beyond this is likely, in my own opinion, to do more harm than good.

('16', 509, 13, 20, 1151709) THE EDITOR THE STAT ESMAN
('16', 509, 14, 21, 1151735) [CALC UTTA]
('16', 509, 16, 22, 1151747) It being quite evident that people outside of Champaran, and least of all the Governments of Behar and Orissa and of India (vide the New Year’s Honours’ List) have no adequate conception of the grievous harm done in that district by Mr. Gandhi’s “mission”, and the ill judged recommendations of the egregious Committee
('16', 510, 0, 1, 1152066) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 511
('16', 510, 1, 2, 1152112) of Enquiry, I am once more tempted to draw attention to and emphasize both cause and effect.
('16', 510, 2, 3, 1152205) To Government Mr. Gandhi gave an assurance that when he returned to Champaran all his efforts would be concentrated on the promotion (really renewal) of amicable relations between landlords and tenants (of the disruption of which he and his supporters were the main if not the only cause).
('16', 510, 2, 4, 1152495) I hope and intend that this letter well enable you to decide whether or not he had loyally abided by his undertaking.
('16', 510, 3, 5, 1152613) His instructions to tenants, since his return, have been to resist all the landlords’ rent demands, unless granted a reduction of 20 per cent; 26 per cent Sarabeshi (as the case may be) or a refund gf 25 per cent Tawan,— this in
('16', 510, 4, 6, 1152842) anticipation of the threatened special legislation, and notwithstanding that there is no law at present to that effect.
('16', 510, 4, 7, 1152962) Not only has this advice, which has been closely followed by the tenants, greatly embarrassed factories in their current working expenses, but has also, for the first time in the 32 years since the floating of the Bettiah Sterling Loan, caused the guarantors (or at least some of them) of the interest for that loan, to fail in the payment of the kist (instalment) which fell due on
('16', 510, 5, 8, 1153345) December 15th last, and thus has actually forced the Estate to borrow money again for the purpose.
('16', 510, 5, 9, 1153444) The guarantors can hardly be held responsible by the Courts of Wards for a failure directly caused by the mistaken action of Government, in sanctioning the wholly unnecessary (as was stated by His Honour the Lieutenant Governor himself) Committee.
('16', 510, 6, 10, 1153692) I was asked by the District Officer to submit a rent collection statement for the Ist quarter of the current Fasli year (1325) for comparison with the same period of last year, in order no doubt to explain the default of the Mothihari Ltd., share, amounting to Rs. 48,590 8, of the above interest, and I showed a deficit of Rs. 56,086 8 3, which more than accounted for the non payment.
('16', 510, 6, 11, 1154079) Fisheries which since time immemorial have belonged to the Raj and to the lessees under the Raj have been and are now being stopped ant looted by misguided tenants under, as they have stated in judicial and police inquiries, the instructions of Mr. Gandhi.
('16', 510, 6, 12, 1154336) The average in this concern for the past five years, or ever since Sarabeshi and Tawan were instituted, of rent suits ant trifling criminal cases, was 21, and less than 3, respectively, per annum.
('16', 510, 6, 13, 1154533) This year, thanks to Mr. Gandhi and the Committee’s recommendations, I anticipate not less than, 2,200 of the former, and for the later I cannot of course make any estimate.
('16', 510, 6, 14, 1154707) From the points of view of the lawyers and usurpers who imported Mr. Gandhi this doubtless is satisfactory but alas!
('16', 510, 6, 15, 1154824) I sigh for the happy record of non litigation now hopelessly broken.
('16', 510, 7, 16, 1154893) At a lecture delivered by Mr. Gandhi in what is known as the ‘‘Gaurakshini Sabha” or refuge for aged cows, in Motihari, that gentleman, I am informed and believe, exhorted his Hindu and Mohamedan listeners to cease fighting with each other about the killing of one cow per annum, and make a united attack on the
('16', 511, 0, 1, 1155205) 512 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 511, 1, 2, 1155247) Saheblog (the landlords) who slaughter and eat cows daily.
('16', 511, 1, 3, 1155306) During the absences of her
('16', 511, 2, 4, 1155333) lord and master at Home Rule and suchlike functions Mrs. Gandhi, following in the footsteps of Mrs. Annie Besant, scatters similar advice broadcast, and has recently, under the shallow pretence of opening a school, started a bazaar in the dehat of one of
('16', 511, 3, 5, 1155588) the smaller concerns, in which grain and other articles can be purchased without the payment to the malik (proprietor) or lessee of the customary bazaar dues, octroi, etc.
('16', 511, 4, 6, 1155760) This is obviously and palpably done to shut down and ruin two neighbouring bazaars belonging to the factory.
('16', 511, 4, 7, 1155869) Can all the above be possibly construed into an honest fulfilment of Mr. Gandhi’s undertaking to Government?
('16', 511, 5, 8, 1155978) Court chaprassis have told me that they dare not mention the disloyalty and
('16', 511, 6, 9, 1156054) defiance of all authority which are openly tallced of in villages into which they have to go in the performance of their duties.
('16', 511, 6, 10, 1156183) At least one court peon, whom I know, went into two of my villages to serve summonses, and was there insulted and hustled and turned out, and was told that no authority, civil or criminal, was now recognized other than that of “Gandhi Saheb”.
('16', 511, 6, 11, 1156426) And so on and so on.
('16', 511, 6, 12, 1156447) Instances might be indefinitely multiplied, but will these serve any purpose when the Government wilfully shuts its eyes to the contempt of all legally constituted authority, and to the defiance of all civil and criminal law, and blindly persists in trying to pass a special Bill affecting only 5 factories in all Behar and Orissa ?
('16', 511, 6, 13, 1156780) And even these so unfairly and inequitably that those whose tenants are discontented and out of hand, are compulsorily benefited, while those whose tenants have not complained nor have had any cause of complaint, are to be most unjustly penalized.
('16', 511, 6, 14, 1157028) There is no knowing to what extremes this sort of special legislation may not be carried and all zemindars and landholders should take warning that their liberties may at any moment be similarly sacrificed for the pacification of any political agitation, and the Permanent Settlement be as ruthlessly brushed aside as the Bengal Tenancy Act, if thought to be standing in the way of any preacher of thinly veiled sedition.
('16', 511, 6, 15, 1157450) I would be, perfectly willing to guarantee that if Mr. Gandhi and his satellites were compelled to evacuate the district, in less than two months order and quiet would be re established, for already the raiyats are jeering at the lavishness of his promises to them and the tenuity of their
('16', 511, 7, 16, 1157740) materialisation.

('16', 512, 2, 3, 1157862) MEMORANDUM OF BIHAR PLANTERS’ ASSOCIATION 1
('16', 512, 3, 4, 1157906) January 5, 1918
('16', 512, 4, 5, 1157922) In the opinion of these members, the Champaran Agrarian Bill is both unnecessary and undesirable for the following reasons:
('16', 512, 5, 6, 1158046) (a) Because it is based on the recommendations of a Committee of Enquiry which was admittedly appointed to allay an artificial agitation, organized outside Champaran and not in any way the consequence of any widespread grievances.
('16', 512, 5, 7, 1158277) The Committee has been shown to have made no genuine enquiry into agrarian conditions in Champaran as a whole, but merely to have made a superficial examination of the management of a small number of Indigo and Ticcadari Estates holding leases from the Court of Wards, and that at a time when the minds of the raiyats were inflamed by
('16', 512, 6, 8, 1158612) an agitation, encouraged by the Government, from which they have been led to expect some sort of Agricultural Millenium.
('16', 512, 6, 9, 1158733) Further, this Committee has been shown to have been actuated solely by a desire to produce a report which one of its members, the leader of the agitation mentioned above, could be induced to sign and not by any wish to report on the full and true facts of the case.
('16', 512, 7, 10, 1158999) The present Bihar and Orissa Government and its predecessors have been fully aware of every detail mentioned in the Committee’s Report, which has neither brought forward any new facts, nor shed any new light on the general position, and have not considered that any special legislation was necessary.
('16', 512, 8, 11, 1159300) As a result of the unsatisfactory and partial enquiries made by this Committee the information it acquired was not sufficient to show the general position in the district in its true light, and this fact, combined with its biased attitude and anxiety to pacify a mischievous agitator at any cost, even, if necessary, by a misuse of Trust Funds under control of the Government, render the Report and the recommendations contained in it so grossly one sided and unfair, that no weight whatever should be given to them, and this legislation which is frankly based on them, should be entirely dropped.
('16', 512, 9, 12, 1159898) (b) Because it singles out one district for invidious and unnecessary legislation.
('16', 512, 10, 13, 1159981) (c) Because it proposes to invalidate existing contracts and incidents of the raiyats’ tenancy, both of which have been proved to be perfectly legal, and the
('16', 512, 11, 14, 1160139) former of which received the direct sanction of the Government of Bengal only seven years ago.
('16', 512, 12, 15, 1160234) 1 This was forwarded by the Board of Revenue to the Secretary, Revenue Department, Government of Bihar and Orissa.
('16', 513, 0, 1, 1160349) 514 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 513, 1, 2, 1160391) (d) Because it proposes to abolish without compensation and for no adequate reason a system which has been in existence for over a hundred years and which is still carried on without friction in other districts.
('16', 513, 2, 3, 1160603) (e) Because it proposes, without the consent of the landlord, to forcibly reduce rents which have been declared after an exhaustive enquiry by the Settlement Officials to be perfectly legal, fair and not excessive, and which have been paid willingly for a number of years.
('16', 513, 3, 4, 1160876) In case the Government persists in pressing this Bill in spite of all the cogent reasons in favour of its abandonment, we will point out some of the chief defects and make certain suggestions which may go some way towards remedying them.
('16', 513, 4, 5, 1161114) Section 3 (1),—This section, as it stands, will render the growing of Indigo and Sugarcane under what is usually known as the khuski system, impossible.
('16', 513, 5, 6, 1161267) Admitting, for the sake of argument, that it is not considered desirable to allow the raiyat to make a contract with his landlord binding himself to sell the
('16', 513, 6, 7, 1161425) produce of a particular crop grown on a fixed proportion of his holding for a long term of years at a flat rate based on the area of the land on which this crop is grown, it is still both desirable and necessary that he should be allowed to agree to sell the produce from a specified plot, selected by himself, at a rate based on the amount of the produce obtained.
('16', 513, 6, 8, 1161791) And this principle is admitted in the statement of objects and reasons attached to the Bill.
('16', 513, 6, 9, 1161884) If as is suggested, he is only to be allowed to bind himself to deliver a certain weight of produce, he is at the mercy of climatic conditions ant renders himself liable to damages if he fails to divert the specified amount, whereas if he contracts to deliver the produce of a certain plot, he is only liable for the amount of the balance of his advance if the crop on that plot does not come up to his expectations.
('16', 513, 7, 10, 1162301) Further, the raiyat almost invariably demands a large advance before he
('16', 513, 8, 11, 1162373) begins to prepare his land, and being an exceedingly thriftless person, if no agreement is permitted binding him to grow the particular crop on a specified plot, he is very likely to take the advance and then fail to sow sufficient suitable land to produce the required amount, and for this reason it will be impossible for the landlord to risk the advance and the price of the seed.
('16', 513, 8, 12, 1162757) Also the raiyat instead of getting money
('16', 513, 9, 13, 1162798) from his landlord without interest will be forced to obtain it from the money lender at an extortionate rate.
('16', 513, 10, 14, 1162908) It is also obviously grossly unfair that existing contracts should be an nulled without warning and without compensation and that a system of cultivation which has been carried on for over a hundred years should be abolished without giving planters time to arrange for an alternative system to take its place.
('16', 513, 11, 15, 1163218) Champaran raiyats are both stupid and conservative at the best of times, and
('16', 513, 12, 16, 1163295) look on any innovation with suspicion, and the present disturbed state of the district
('16', 514, 0, 1, 1163382) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 515
('16', 514, 1, 2, 1163428) and the agitation still being carried on by Mr. Gandhi’s followers will render the institution of the khuski system doubly difficult.
('16', 514, 1, 3, 1163562) We, therefore, wish to urge most
('16', 514, 2, 4, 1163595) strongly that contracts now in force should be allowed to continue for three years more or such time as outstanding advances on the original sattas remain unpaid on the understanding that planters will endeavour to replace the tinkathia system by the khuski system during that period.
('16', 514, 3, 5, 1163880) It is often very difficult to collect these sums and raiyats can cause an infinite
('16', 514, 4, 6, 1163963) amount of trouble and expense if they refuse to pay, as they know that the individual amounts are very often so small as not to be worth suing for, though collectively they may amount to a very large sum.
('16', 514, 5, 7, 1164168) It is, therefore, recommended that the above condition in favour of the planter shall be allowed to continue until the balance of the advantage received by the raiyat
('16', 514, 6, 8, 1164335) shall have been completely restored.
('16', 514, 6, 9, 1164372) This could cause no hardship, as the raiyat can at any time refund it either through the post or the civil courts.

('16', 514, 10, 13, 1164590) January 31, 1918
('16', 514, 11, 14, 1164607) 1. We first discussed the khuski system.
('16', 514, 11, 15, 1164648) Mr. Gandhi objected to the hypothecation of any particular plot but said he did not object to the raiyat
('16', 514, 12, 16, 1164753) contracting to grow a certain amount of land in indigo.
('16', 514, 12, 17, 1164809) I then suggested substituting in the Champaran Planters’ proposed amendment the words “produce of a certain proportion of his holding” ins tead of the wor ds “pr oduce of any spe cifie d fie ld or plo t sel ected by him self”.
('16', 514, 12, 18, 1165036) Mr. Gandhi then suggested draft provisions to clauses 3, 4 and 5 (vide footnote 1).
('16', 514, 13, 19, 1165120) 2. We next discussed the proposed amendment making the satta obligation
('16', 514, 14, 20, 1165192) continue until advance is paid off.
('16', 514, 14, 21, 1165228) Mr.Gandhi objected altogether to this, though it was explained that it might save much litigation.
('16', 514, 15, 22, 1165327) 3. We then discussed Sirnie.
('16', 514, 15, 23, 1165356) Mr. Gandhi’s view was that neither Jallaha nor Sirnie deserved any consideration whatever although Sirnie may have taken a less rate of sharabeshi than Turkaulia.
('16', 514, 16, 24, 1165519) 1 This footnote reads: “3(1) Provided that nothing in this sub section shall prevent a raiyat from entering into a contract to grow a particular crop on any portion of his holding in terms of section 5 thereof.
('16', 514, 16, 25, 1165730) To section 5 — Provided that nothing in the contract shall take away or limit the raiyats’ freedom to select the land.”

('16', 515, 1, 2, 1165892) 4. We then discussed the proposal to make the sharabeshi enhancement as
('16', 515, 2, 3, 1165964) reduced binding.
('16', 515, 2, 4, 1165981) Mr. Gandhi agreed on this point but quoted from his letter of 24th January 1918 in which he said that “any amendment will have to carefully guard the right of appeal on grounds of irregularity or want of jurisdiction”, as for instance the Settlement Officer may have wrongly recorded the incident or where there is a manifest clerical error.
('16', 515, 3, 5, 1166323) 5. As to abwab Mr. Gandhi has no objection to the proposal to make it
('16', 515, 4, 6, 1166393) applicable to the whole Province.
('16', 515, 5, 7, 1166427) As to Mr. Gandhi’s own amendment to make the landlord liable in all cases it can be put before the Select Committee but Government cannot undertake to withdraw the whole section if it is not accepted.
('16', 515, 5, 8, 1166628) Mr. Gandhi also objects strongly to the retention of sub clause (3) of the clause.
('16', 515, 6, 9, 1166711) 6. As to cart sattas Mr. Gandhi insists that there should be a provision ending these, otherwise there will be [a] crop of law suits on the cart sattas.
('16', 515, 7, 10, 1166864) 7. The question of refund of tawan was mentioned but not discussed at this
('16', 515, 8, 11, 1166939) interview.

('16', 515, 11, 15, 1167033) SHANKARLAL BANKER'S LEAFLET
('16', 515, 12, 16, 1167061) This is the first leaflet l write for you.
('16', 515, 12, 17, 1167104) I wish, therefore, to state at the very outset that my right to advise you is only nominal.
('16', 515, 12, 18, 1167196) I have not done any manual labour.
('16', 515, 12, 19, 1167231) I have not suffered the miseries that workers have to endure, nor can I do anything myself to remove that misery.
('16', 515, 12, 20, 1167345) Therefore, I feel hesitant in giving advice on this occasion.
('16', 515, 12, 21, 1167407) But, even though I have done nothing for you in the past it is my keen desire to do what I can hereafter according to my capacity.
('16', 515, 12, 22, 1167538) I write this with that desire.
('16', 515, 13, 23, 1167569) Two days ago our situation had taken a serious turn.
('16', 515, 13, 24, 1167622) Some of you were in straitened circumstances, but instead of taking to labour to get relief from those circumstances as urged so often by Gandhiji, it was apprehended that some of you would break the vow and get back to the mills.
('16', 515, 13, 25, 1167853) But that situation has now passed away.
('16', 515, 13, 26, 1167893) Our dull hearts have been quickened by Gandhiji’s fast.
('16', 515, 13, 27, 1167949) We have become conscious of the seriousness of our oath.
('16', 515, 13, 28, 1168006) We are convinced that ‘we shall not break the oath even at the cost of our lives’ is not a slogan merely to be repeated in meetings but has to be demonstrated in action.
('16', 515, 13, 29, 1168176) As a proof of this change in the situation, those who are in financial difficulty have willingly begun to do manual work.
('16', 515, 13, 30, 1168298) Not only so, but also those who are better off have set an example by assisting from their wages those in need, and have removed the possibility of a split among us
('16', 516, 0, 1, 1168463) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 517
('16', 516, 1, 2, 1168509) for all time.
('16', 516, 1, 3, 1168523) But that is not enough.
('16', 516, 1, 4, 1168547) A very heavy responsibility has come over us by Gandhiji’s fast; and if we understand that responsibility fully, we should exert ourselves to the utmost to end this struggle as soon as possible, we should adopt all such means as would shorten the struggle consistently with keeping to our pledge.
('16', 516, 1, 5, 1168844) Our oath is to obtain a 35 per cent increase.
('16', 516, 1, 6, 1168890) And we know that financially it is not difficult for the employers to give the 35 per cent increase.
('16', 516, 1, 7, 1168991) But employers feel that if they gave the 35 per cent, the workers will become domineering and insolent, that they will become unruly at the slightest provocation, and ruin the industry by resorting to strikes on trifling matters.
('16', 516, 1, 8, 1169221) I see no reason for entertaining such a fear.
('16', 516, 1, 9, 1169267) Workers can never desire that an industry which gives them their daily bread should be destroyed.
('16', 516, 1, 10, 1169365) But if workers behave without discretion and without thinking about justice or injustice, such a result is inevitable.
('16', 516, 1, 11, 1169484) If we desire to be saved from it, we should determine to work regularly for the mill owners in good faith.
('16', 516, 1, 12, 1169591) We should decide not to make unreasonable demands, and not to resort to remedies like strikes to secure justice until all other avenues are exhausted.
('16', 516, 1, 13, 1169742) But our task is not over with such a determination.
('16', 516, 1, 14, 1169794) We have to go to the employers, acquaint them with our decision and win their confidence.
('16', 516, 1, 15, 1169884) We have to remove the misapprehension which restrains them from giving us the 35 per cent increase.
('16', 516, 1, 16, 1169984) I strongly urge upon the workers to take immediate steps in this direction.

('16', 516, 4, 19, 1170094) COMMISSIONER PRATT’S SPEECH
('16', 516, 5, 20, 1170122) [AHMEDABAD,
('16', 516, 6, 21, 1170134) April 12, 1918]
('16', 516, 7, 22, 1170150) I would like you to listen to me attentively and repeat to everybody what I say, when you go back to your villages so that what I say to you now may come to be known throughout the district; for what I am going to say to you today is not only for you but for the whole district.
('16', 516, 7, 23, 1170429) You have been given much advice by Mahatma Gandhi and Vallabhbhai Saheb and other gentlemen who are working with them.
('16', 516, 7, 24, 1170548) They have made speeches from village to village but today I would request you to listen to me.
('16', 516, 8, 25, 1170643) The rights of the agricu lturists are such that they can keep the land in their posses sion for genera tions.
('16', 516, 8, 26, 1170753) But those rights carry with them the duty to pay regula rly the land revenu e assess ment fixed accord ing to law.
('16', 516, 8, 27, 1170868) It is only on that condit ion that you can contin ue to enjoy the posses sion of your land.
('16', 516, 8, 28, 1170960) It is the Govern ment who determ ines the assess ment throug h the instru mentality of its office rs and withou t the interv ention of any lawyer or barris ter.
('16', 516, 8, 29, 1171121) No one but the
('16', 517, 0, 1, 1171136) 518 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('16', 517, 1, 2, 1171178) Govern ment has the right to fix the assess ment.
('16', 517, 1, 3, 1171228) It is not a matter of which the civil courts can take cogniz ance.
('16', 517, 1, 4, 1171295) No one can go to a court with a compla int that the land revenu e assess ment is too high.
('16', 517, 1, 5, 1171386) The agriculturists have no legal right to demand or to insist upon the postponement of the assessment.
('16', 517, 1, 6, 1171489) That is entirely within our gift.
('16', 517, 1, 7, 1171523) We issue orders after taking into account the condition of the crop and any complaints and objections that may be raised.
('16', 517, 1, 8, 1171645) After the final order is passed, there is no appeal.
('16', 517, 1, 9, 1171698) It is not a matter for Gandhiji or Vallabhbhai, and on that particular issue your fight will be in vain.
('16', 517, 1, 10, 1171803) That is what I wish to impress upon you and you must pay heed to these words, not merely because they are my words, but because they represent the legal position.
('16', 517, 1, 11, 1171966) It is not merely my order but that of Lord Willingdon.
('16', 517, 1, 12, 1172021) I have in my possession his letter which says that he will accept whatever order I will pass in this matter.
('16', 517, 1, 13, 1172130) You must, therefore, realize that it is not just I who am talking today but His Excellency the Governor.
('16', 517, 2, 14, 1172235) Mr. Gandhi is a very good man, a very holy man and he gives you advice because he believes genuinely and honestly that it is in your interest.
('16', 517, 2, 15, 1172378) He thinks that by not paying up the land revenue assessment, you will be protecting the poor; that is what he was telling me when he saw me yesterday.
('16', 517, 2, 16, 1172529) But isn’t the Government the protector of the poor?
('16', 517, 2, 17, 1172581) Is it the duty of your Governor or is it your duty to protect the poor?
('16', 517, 2, 18, 1172653) Do you not remember the days of the famine?
('16', 517, 2, 19, 1172697) In the famine of 1900, in the famine of 1902 caused by rats, I was the Collector of Ahmedabad and Panchmahal Districts.
('16', 517, 2, 20, 1172817) You will remember how many works had been opened by the Government for assisting the poor.
('16', 517, 2, 21, 1172908) I remember how many hundreds of thousands of rupees were spent for feeding the people, in building tanks and in giving taqavi loans.
('16', 517, 3, 22, 1173041) amongst you who are old will certainly remember those days.
('16', 517, 3, 23, 1173101) It is against such a Government that today your fight in this district is being waged.
('16', 517, 3, 24, 1173188) There is a big war going on in the world, and the circumstances are such that it is the duty of you all to give the Government every assistance.
('16', 517, 3, 25, 1173333) But instead of that what does the Government get from this District?
('16', 517, 3, 26, 1173402) Does it get assistance, or does it get opposition?
('16', 517, 4, 27, 1173453) If you continue this fight against the Government it will be you who will have
('16', 517, 5, 28, 1173532) to bear the consequences and not these gentlemen of the Home Rule League.
('16', 517, 5, 29, 1173606) They will
('16', 517, 6, 30, 1173616) not suffer in any way.
('16', 517, 6, 31, 1173639) They are not the people who will go to jail.
('16', 517, 6, 32, 1173684) When a movement
('16', 517, 7, 33, 1173700) of this kind was started in Africa, Mahatma Gandhi went to jail.
('16', 517, 7, 34, 1173765) In this country he
('16', 517, 8, 35, 1173784) will not go to jail.
('16', 517, 8, 36, 1173805) Jail is not a fit place for him.
('16', 517, 8, 37, 1173838) I tell you again that he is a very good
('16', 517, 9, 38, 1173878) and a very holy man.
('16', 517, 10, 39, 1173899) The Government does not harbour any anger against you.
('16', 517, 10, 40, 1173954) If children kick their
('16', 517, 11, 41, 1173977) parents, the parents are sad, but they do not get angry.
('16', 517, 11, 42, 1174034) Why must you suffer all this loss, forfeiture, chauthai fine, confiscation, the disruption of the Narva right?
('16', 517, 12, 43, 1174145) do you want to destroy your property by your own hands ?
('16', 517, 12, 44, 1174202) Do you wish to lose your
('16', 518, 0, 1, 1174227) VOL. 16: 1 SEPTEMBER, 1917 23 APRIL, 1918 519
('16', 518, 1, 2, 1174273) Narva right ?
('16', 518, 1, 3, 1174287) Do you not care for your women and children?
('16', 518, 1, 4, 1174332) Would you like to be
('16', 518, 2, 5, 1174353) reduced to the status of labourers, and what for ?
('16', 518, 3, 6, 1174404) I have 28 years’ experience of land revenue law.
('16', 518, 3, 7, 1174453) Mahatma Gandhi is my friend.
('16', 518, 3, 8, 1174482) He came to this country from Africa only two or three years ago; he has spent the greater part of his life in Africa.
('16', 518, 3, 9, 1174600) He is well versed in religion.
('16', 518, 3, 10, 1174631) Whatever advice he gives on that subject is sound, but in political matters, in matters concerning land and land revenu assessment, he knows very little.
('16', 518, 3, 11, 1174785) I know far more about these matters, and I shall be sorry to see you suffer the consequnces of your ill advised actions.
('16', 518, 3, 12, 1174906) I shall be sorry to see the lands of good Patidars confiscated.
('16', 518, 3, 13, 1174970) Government knows that there has been a misunderstanding regarding the rights of agriculturists.
('16', 518, 3, 14, 1175066) Therefore, the benevolent Government is giving you this final opportunity of listening to its advice.
('16', 518, 4, 15, 1175168) I have come here to give you this advice, and I have only this to say that it is duty of the agriculturists to pay up their land revenu dues.
('16', 518, 4, 16, 1175310) Do not think that our Mamlatdars and talatis will collect money by seizing and selling your property.
('16', 518, 4, 17, 1175412) They will not take so much trouble.
('16', 518, 4, 18, 1175448) Our time is very valuable.
('16', 518, 4, 19, 1175475) They will not go to anybody’s house to collect the money.
('16', 518, 4, 20, 1175533) I am not threatening you.
('16', 518, 4, 21, 1175559) You must realize that parents do not threaten but merely give advice.
('16', 518, 4, 22, 1175629) If you will not pay your assessment, your land will be confiscated.
('16', 518, 4, 23, 1175697) Many people tell you that that will not be so.
('16', 518, 4, 24, 1175744) But I tell you that that will be so.
('16', 518, 4, 25, 1175781) It is not necessary for me to take any pledge to that effect, but I have the authority to make good my words.
('16', 518, 4, 26, 1175891) Those who refuse to pay land revenue assessment will not get back their land.
('16', 518, 4, 27, 1175969) The Government does not wish to retain on their books such agriculturists, nor are we anxious to include the names of such in our records of rights.
('16', 518, 4, 28, 1176118) Once those names have been removed they will not be re entered.
('16', 518, 4, 29, 1176182) Now, let me tell you one more thing in conclusion.
('16', 518, 4, 30, 1176233) If anyone, through misunderstanding or mistake, takes a pledge, he need not consider himself bound by that pledge.
('16', 518, 4, 31, 1176348) Such a pledge need not be kept.
('16', 518, 4, 32, 1176380) If you break such a pledge no one can say to you that you have sinned or have committed a mistake.
('16', 518, 4, 33, 1176479) The world will regard such a person as innocent.
('16', 518, 4, 34, 1176528) You will recollect what happened in Ahmedabad.
('16', 518, 4, 35, 1176575) Many of you may not read newspapers; therefore I will tell you.
('16', 518, 4, 36, 1176639) There was a struggle recently in Ahmedabad between the mill owners and the mill hands.
('16', 518, 4, 37, 1176726) The latter had taken an oath that they would not go back to work until they got an increase of 35 per cent in their wages.
('16', 518, 4, 38, 1176849) But what happened in the end?
('16', 518, 4, 39, 1176879) When they realized that their pledge was not reasonable they could not adhere to it, they broke it and accepted an increase of 27 1/2 per cent and resumed work.
('16', 518, 4, 40, 1177040) In the same way, I tell you that when you took this pledge, you made a mistake.
('16', 518, 4, 41, 1177120) You did it only because you forgot your duty towards the Government.
('16', 518, 4, 42, 1177189) You did not give full weight to the consequences of this pledge; consequences not only to yourself but to your children.
('16', 518, 4, 43, 1177310) Taking into account all this I ask you to think again and decide whether you should do your duty by the Government or adhere to your pledge and suffer the consequences?
('16', 518, 5, 44, 1177479) Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
