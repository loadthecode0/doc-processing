('87', 4, 3, 5, 4282) I cannot fall in line with Sir Puru shottamdas’s opinion.

('87', 4, 3, 11, 4550) I have also said that he should demonstrate it in practice.

('87', 4, 3, 13, 4723) It is like injecting life into a corpse.

('87', 5, 9, 20, 6576) There is very little difference between Sindhi and Urdu scripts.
('87', 5, 9, 21, 6641) You must also be knowing that I call Hindustani that language which rural Hindus and Muslims of North India speak and which they write in the Nagari or Urdu scripts.
('87', 5, 9, 22, 6807) So, if I may advise you, I would suggest that you teach Hindustani to Hindu and Muslim boys in all the schools in both the scripts.
('87', 5, 9, 23, 6939) It is an old thing but did not make much progress.

('87', 7, 8, 15, 8979) QUESTION: Gandhiji, is there any special message you would care to send to the Negro people of America?
('87', 7, 9, 16, 9083) ANSWER: My life is its own message.
('87', 7, 9, 17, 9119) If it is not, then nothing I can now write will fulfil the purpose.
('87', 7, 10, 18, 9187) When asked to comment on the probable trend of the race relations, Mr. Gandhi said: My faith burns brighter today, even brighter than it has in the
('87', 7, 11, 19, 9335) 1 According to the source, the interviewer, a Negro journalist, was Far Eastern correspondent of Chicago Defender, in which the interview appeared on June 10, 1945. Brooks reported: “ .

('87', 7, 11, 23, 9690) I asked questions and he hurriedly jotted down his answers.” 2 Brooks reported that “later in the evening” he had attended the “prayers”.
('87', 7, 11, 24, 9828) Gandhiji reached Panchgani on May 31, 1945, in the evening.

('87', 8, 1, 2, 9928) past; we are fast approaching a solution to roublesome race problems.
('87', 8, 2, 3, 9998) This he feels will be accomplished in spite of present day discouraging symptoms.
('87', 8, 2, 4, 10080) And he still feels that the best weapon for use by underprivileged peoples is non violence.
('87', 8, 3, 5, 10172) Pointing to his recent statement 1 made at the beginning of the San Francisco Conference, he indicated that India’s freedom was closely identified with the welfare of all other under privileged peoples.
('87', 8, 3, 6, 10375) At that time he had said:
('87', 8, 4, 7, 10401) The freedom of India will demonstrate to all exploited races of the earth that their freedom is very near and that in no case will they be exploited.

('87', 8, 6, 10, 10611) I have quite a few co workers who are more or less exclusively engaged in doing my work and who, therefore, have a claim on me.
('87', 8, 6, 11, 10739) However, such a claim should not be made in so many words; otherwise I would not be able to do the work which I ought to do.
('87', 8, 6, 12, 10864) Kundarji asked me to write a Foreword for Gitai ani Gitai and Gitadhyayasangati.
('87', 8, 6, 13, 10945) How could I say ‘No’ to him?
('87', 8, 6, 14, 10974) I agreed and so it became my duty to read Gitadhyayasangati and Kundarji’s Preface.
('87', 8, 6, 15, 11058) This took away one hour of my time.
('87', 8, 6, 16, 11094) The work will suffer if I let my hours go thus and the Gita will cease to be my spiritual dictionary.
('87', 8, 7, 17, 11196) The beauty of Gitai is that its meaning and music are rendered 3
('87', 8, 8, 18, 11261) in Marathi in such a way that those who do not know the original Gita can enjoy reading it as they would the original.

('87', 9, 2, 3, 11737) Vinoba has been my co worker ever since the Ashram at Kochrab 1 was set up.
('87', 9, 2, 4, 11813) He has done plenty of work that I wanted him to do or that which was dear to me.
('87', 9, 2, 5, 11894) Take for instance Gitadhyay asangati.
('87', 9, 2, 6, 11932) I had asked for a little, Vinoba gave me much.
('87', 9, 2, 7, 11979) The readers should know that the idea of reciting the Gita in fourteen days and then in seven days first occurred to me in Yeravda Prison.
('87', 9, 2, 8, 12118) I told Vinoba of what I had in mind and asked for his approval and also his suggestions.
('87', 9, 2, 9, 12207) In reply he sent me Gitadhyayasangati.
('87', 9, 2, 10, 12246) By having this before him the reader who wants to concentrate on the Gita and put its teaching into practice will 2 be benefited.

('87', 11, 3, 6, 13849) If I don’t get a man, I can beg for services.
('87', 11, 3, 7, 13895) His eyes are weak.
('87', 11, 3, 8, 13914) He would need someone to write in Gujarati and Hindi.

('87', 11, 3, 11, 14111) The help is to be given there.

('87', 11, 9, 22, 14588) How did you get dysentery?
('87', 11, 9, 23, 14615) The ideal diet is that which improves one’s health day by day.
('87', 11, 9, 24, 14678) Do you think there is some defect in your diet somewhere?
('87', 11, 9, 25, 14736) You yourself should discover it.

('87', 13, 8, 12, 16486) Man’s duty is but to endeavour.
('87', 13, 8, 13, 16518) Success depends on the grace of God.
('87', 13, 8, 14, 16555) We should seek solitude among the multitudes— inaction in activity—but such activity should be without desire for fruits.

('87', 16, 3, 13, 19475) He deserves pity.

('87', 18, 3, 5, 21697) I am taking out the old ones today.
('87', 18, 3, 6, 21733) There is one question in that.
('87', 18, 3, 7, 21764) Singing certainly has a place in Nayee Talim.
('87', 18, 3, 8, 21810) Singing implies a knowledge of notes and this one must have.

('87', 19, 3, 6, 22502) The wedding was on the 21st.
('87', 19, 3, 7, 22531) You might have received the letter in time if I had written to you the same day.
('87', 19, 3, 8, 22612) But I could read the letter only today.
('87', 19, 3, 9, 22652) There is so much work.

('87', 19, 7, 20, 23135) I do not like to borrow money for Kashmir.
('87', 19, 7, 21, 23178) The condition seems to me very strict.
('87', 19, 7, 22, 23217) They refuse to give it for five years.
('87', 19, 7, 23, 23256) I do not see any harm in having a look at the old yarn.
('87', 19, 7, 24, 23312) However, it would be better if we could manage without a loan.
('87', 19, 7, 25, 23375) This is my personal view.
('87', 19, 7, 26, 23401) You can take a loan if the conditions are acceptable to you, if our workers from Kashmir are also willing and if we cannot give them the money in any other way.
('87', 19, 7, 27, 23562) If it becomes necessary to take the loan, I will give my signature when it is required.

('87', 20, 3, 4, 23837) RAMASWAMI, I have not replied to two of your letters.
('87', 20, 3, 5, 23891) The reason is work.
('87', 20, 3, 6, 23911) The postcard does not call for any reply.
('87', 20, 3, 7, 23953) You must have received money for the months of April and May.
('87', 20, 3, 8, 24015) I am sorry that there was some irregularity in sending the money.
('87', 20, 3, 9, 24081) I am responsible for that.
('87', 20, 3, 10, 24108) When your continuing became uncertain probably I was not able to make up my mind as to what should be the duty of the Ashram towards you.
('87', 20, 3, 11, 24246) I do not remember it well.
('87', 20, 3, 12, 24273) I am sorry that your parents were a little hurt.
('87', 20, 3, 13, 24322) Only the poor have true and pure ambition.
('87', 20, 3, 14, 24365) That certainly lifts them high and throws them into the hands of the demon.
('87', 20, 3, 15, 24441) This is the translation of “between the devil and the deep sea”.
('87', 20, 3, 16, 24506) What you say is not true.
('87', 20, 3, 17, 24532) When you feel that you are going to fall into the hands of Satan, you should give up that work.
('87', 20, 3, 18, 24628) I don’t think it proper to say more to you in this connection.
('87', 20, 3, 19, 24691) You must yourself realize your duty.
('87', 20, 3, 20, 24728) Do not blame the zemindar if you want the fame which you can acquire with your money.
('87', 20, 3, 21, 24814) Just as among the poor, there are also good and bad among them.
('87', 20, 3, 22, 24878) All poor people are not good and all rich people are not bad.
('87', 20, 3, 23, 24940) Ponder over the basic things while you are entering a new life.
('87', 20, 3, 24, 25004) I hope there won’t be any difficulty in understanding my language.
('87', 20, 3, 25, 25071) You should learn to speak and write in Hindi.
('87', 20, 3, 26, 25117) Keep on writing to me.

('87', 21, 1, 2, 25284) 41. FOREWORD TO “VARNAVYAVASTHA” 1
('87', 21, 2, 3, 25319) I do not have the time to read this book again.
('87', 21, 2, 4, 25367) I do not even wish to.
('87', 21, 2, 5, 25390) I have many other things to do.
('87', 21, 2, 6, 25422) In my opinion a man daily moves either forward or backward.
('87', 21, 2, 7, 25482) He never stands still.
('87', 21, 2, 8, 25505) The whole world is moving.
('87', 21, 2, 9, 25532) There is no exception to it.
('87', 21, 2, 10, 25561) I will be making a wrong statement if I say that I am today what I was yesterday and will remain the same in future.
('87', 21, 2, 11, 25678) In fact I should not even have such a desire.
('87', 21, 2, 12, 25724) It is right however that my writings and utterances should not be such as to confuse others.
('87', 21, 2, 13, 25817) I should not write things which can bear two interpretations.
('87', 21, 2, 14, 25879) That is to say I should always have an eye to truth and non violence while writing, speaking or doing anything.
('87', 21, 2, 15, 25991) I can say that I have been doing that ever since I gave my word to my mother.
('87', 21, 2, 16, 26069) In fact I became a devotee of truth ever since I reached the age of understanding.
('87', 21, 2, 17, 26152) This does not mean that I have had or even today have a full vision of truth and ahimsa.
('87', 21, 2, 18, 26241) But I do believe that my vision of truth and ahimsa is becoming clearer every day.
('87', 21, 2, 19, 26324) Therefore it would not be correct to say that my views on Varnashrama are the same as they were in the past.
('87', 21, 2, 20, 26433) I have said that the varnas and the ashramas are the gifts of Hinduism to the world, and I still adhere to that view.
('87', 21, 2, 21, 26551) But today neither the varnas nor the ashramas of my conception are in existence anywhere.
('87', 21, 2, 22, 26641) They should form a part of our religion.
('87', 21, 2, 23, 26682) But it can be said that these days the ashramas have disappeared altogether and varnas are found in the form of privileges.
('87', 21, 2, 24, 26806) The claim of being a Brahmin, a Kshatriya, a Vaishya connotes pride.
('87', 21, 2, 25, 26875) How can there be pride where there is religion?
('87', 21, 2, 26, 26923) And the Shudras are not taken into consideration at all!
('87', 21, 2, 27, 26980) Shudras are low and the Ati Shudras are the lowest of the low.
('87', 21, 2, 28, 27043) This is not religion but a negation of it.
('87', 21, 2, 29, 27086) Where are the four varnas of the Gita today?
('87', 21, 2, 30, 27131) Varna is entirely different from caste.
('87', 21, 2, 31, 27171) There are numerous castes.
('87', 21, 2, 32, 27198) I know of no authority for caste in the Gita or any other scripture.
('87', 21, 2, 33, 27267) The Gita has prescribed four varnas and they are based on one’s aptitudes and karma.
('87', 21, 2, 34, 27352) I am saying four just to give you an example.
('87', 21, 2, 35, 27398) There can be more or less varnas than that.
('87', 21, 2, 36, 27442) But there prevails only one varna today,
('87', 21, 3, 37, 27483) 1 Gandhiji wrote this under the title “Key to My Writings”.
('87', 22, 0, 1, 27543) VOL. 87: 29 MAY, 1945 29 AUGUST, 1945 23
('87', 22, 1, 2, 27584) that is, of Shudras’, or, you may call it, Ati Shudras’, or Harijans’ or untouchables.
('87', 22, 1, 3, 27671) I have no doubt about the truth of what I say.
('87', 22, 1, 4, 27718) If I can bring round the Hindu society to my view, all our internal quarrels will come to an end.
('87', 22, 1, 5, 27816) That will also put an end to communal riots between Hindus and Muslims, and the people of India will occupy a place of honour in the world.
('87', 22, 1, 6, 27956) Just as it is not dharma but adharma to believe in the distinctions of high and low, so also colour prejudice is adharma.
('87', 22, 1, 7, 28078) If a scripture is found to sanction distinctions of high and low, or distinctions of colour, it does not deserve the name of scripture.
('87', 22, 1, 8, 28214) One should approach the scriptures with the assumption that they would not say anything which is contrary to dharma.
('87', 22, 1, 9, 28331) Caste distinctions have taken such deep roots that they have infected the Muslims, Christians and others.
('87', 22, 1, 10, 28437) It is true that there are class destinations in more or less degree in all the religions, from which one has to conclude that that failing is inherent in every human being.
('87', 22, 1, 11, 28610) We can cleanse ourselves of that failing only by pure dharma.
('87', 22, 1, 12, 28672) I have not found sanction for such distinctions between high and low in any scriptures.
('87', 22, 1, 13, 28760) In the eyes of religion all men are equal.
('87', 22, 1, 14, 28803) An educated, intelligent and affluent man is no better than an ignorant, stupid and poor man.
('87', 22, 1, 15, 28897) If he is cultured, that is to say, if he has been purified by dharma, he will utilise his education, intelligence and money in the service of his illiterate, stupid and poor brethren.
('87', 22, 1, 16, 29081) And he will strive to give them, that is to say, the whole world, what he has got.
('87', 22, 1, 17, 29164) If that is true of religion, then in our present condition, devoid of religion our dharma lies in becoming Ati Shudras voluntarily.
('87', 22, 1, 18, 29296) A man should consider himself not the owner of his property but its trustee or custodian.
('87', 22, 1, 19, 29386) He will use it for the service of society.
('87', 22, 1, 20, 29429) He will accept only that much for himself as he has earned with his labour.
('87', 22, 1, 21, 29505) If that happens, no one will be poor and no one rich.
('87', 22, 1, 22, 29559) In such a system all religions will naturally be held equal.
('87', 22, 1, 23, 29620) Therefore all quarrels arising out of religions, caste and economic differences will be ended.
('87', 22, 1, 24, 29715) At this stage it is also necessary to ponder over one further point.
('87', 22, 1, 25, 29784) It is the foremost dharma of a subject nation to free itself of the bondage at the very first opportunity.
('87', 22, 1, 26, 29891) A subject is compulsorily an Ati Shudra.
('87', 22, 1, 27, 29932) It is immaterial whether he has been given titles, or whether he is made a judge or a peon of a judge or whether he is a king or a pauper.
('87', 22, 1, 28, 30071) The more titles one has the more abject is one’s condition under alien rule.
('87', 22, 1, 29, 30148) Thus by correlating freedom with dharma and making the latter widespread, we shall in the natural course of
('87', 23, 0, 1, 30256) 24 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('87', 23, 1, 2, 30297) things arrive at the state described in the previous paragraph.
('87', 23, 1, 3, 30361) A man who wants to follow his dharma will not bother about the time when this may be realized.
('87', 23, 1, 4, 30456) If many people do so, it will not only end our subjection but there will not be any anarchy or confusion in our freedom.
('87', 23, 1, 5, 30577) This is the swaraj of my dreams.
('87', 23, 1, 6, 30610) I yearn for that.
('87', 23, 1, 7, 30628) I want to live for the attainment of it.
('87', 23, 1, 8, 30669) I am devoting every breath of my life to that effort.
('87', 23, 1, 9, 30723) The reader is therefore requested to discard anything in this book which may appear to him incompatible with my views given above.
('87', 23, 1, 10, 30854) In order to save me labour, a friend who has digested my views and has done so with great effort, has sent me a brief note of my present views.
('87', 23, 1, 11, 30998) Shri Kishorelal thought that I could save time if I could affix my signature to it.
('87', 23, 1, 12, 31082) I was free to make any corrections I liked.
('87', 23, 1, 13, 31126) But while going through it I found that Shri Kishorelal has, as is his wont, read through the whole book, has pondered over it and then has drafted a note as a testimony of my present views.
('87', 23, 1, 14, 31317) Even if I cannot sign it, it should be published along with this.
('87', 23, 1, 15, 31383) There is no incompatibility between his key and mine.
('87', 23, 1, 16, 31437) Shri Kishorelal’s note is based on the study of this book and therefore it would be more helpful to the readers.
('87', 23, 1, 17, 31550) May Truth alone triumph.

('87', 24, 3, 4, 31749) MANILAL, I got your postcard.
('87', 24, 3, 5, 31779) You did not say where I should address this reply.
('87', 24, 3, 6, 31830) When one is constantly moving about, one should indicate the address either at the top or at the bottom.
('87', 24, 3, 7, 31935) Since Sushila has come after so many years, she is naturally very anxious to meet relations.
('87', 24, 3, 8, 32028) Maybe, she does not, therefore, bother about the heat.
('87', 24, 3, 9, 32083) I feel concerned about the children.
('87', 24, 3, 10, 32120) I hope they are not over strained.
('87', 24, 3, 11, 32155) I leave for Panchgani this evening.
('87', 24, 3, 12, 32191) There is bound to be crowding there.
('87', 24, 3, 13, 32228) But I have provided for you two, together with the children.
('87', 24, 3, 14, 32289) I am planning in my mind to secure one more bungalow.
('87', 24, 3, 15, 32343) However, since the breeze has started in Bombay it must be cooler now.
('87', 24, 3, 16, 32414) All of you can spend a month in Bombay; the place will be cool enough.
('87', 24, 3, 17, 32485) If possible call on Jairamdas once again.
('87', 24, 3, 18, 32527) I didn’t read [the article] about Rajaji carefully.
('87', 24, 3, 19, 32579) You should forget it.
('87', 24, 3, 20, 32601) I don’t feel hurt by anything he does.
('87', 24, 3, 21, 32640) He is acting according to his own lights.

('87', 24, 9, 31, 33010) It is all right.
('87', 24, 9, 32, 33027) However, I do not intend to write in that way.
('87', 24, 9, 33, 33074) I will not involve myself and my readers in the controversy.
('87', 24, 9, 34, 33135) I will try to give the key for reading my writings.
('87', 24, 9, 35, 33187) You have written on the basis of my writings, so it would perhaps be better if it is published as it is, under your name.

('87', 25, 1, 6, 33546) As knowledge grows, the meaning of a word becomes wider, which it should.
('87', 25, 1, 7, 33620) Why should we stick to the meanings of the critics?
('87', 25, 1, 8, 33672) Even then, what you say seems correct from the point of view of language.
('87', 25, 1, 9, 33746) The pity is that I am not a linguist and therefore whatever occurred to me on the spur of the moment, I wrote down.

('87', 28, 8, 15, 37181) May 1945 A correspondent asks me to speak about other village industries as I do about khadi.
('87', 28, 8, 16, 37275) Khadi is the only handicraft which is widespread.
('87', 28, 8, 17, 37325) Besides, I have likened it to the sun, and the other industries to the planets.
('87', 28, 8, 18, 37405) 2 The sun is only one, while the planets are many and new ones are being discovered.
('87', 28, 8, 19, 37490) For the present, it will be enough if you concentrate on hand made paper, hand ground flour, hand pounded rice, ghani pressed oil, honey from live bees, hide from dead cattle and articles made from it in villages, village walking sticks, village buttons, palm gur, etc.
('87', 28, 8, 20, 37760) As a matter of fact agriculture is a village industry, hence grains,
('87', 28, 9, 21, 37829) 1 The addressee who was working among the tribes of Jaunsar and Bawer at Nagthat, near Mussoorie, built the Ashok Ashram and started a school and dispensary in memory of Kasturba Gandhi.
('87', 28, 9, 22, 38016) He opened the Ashram in July 1942, but was arrested a month after.
('87', 28, 9, 23, 38083) Having been released, he was developing it into a training centre for village industries.

('87', 29, 1, 3, 38329) In short, when villages are self contained, cities will be dependent on them.
('87', 29, 1, 4, 38407) As you can see, the tooth brush belongs to the cities, while datun belongs to the villages and is better; tooth powder is of the city while charcoal powder, chalk or salt are of the village.

('87', 30, 8, 18, 39852) A wire has been sent to you, to the effect that you should go to Khadi Pratishthan.
('87', 30, 8, 19, 39936) If you keep good health there, stay on and learn.
('87', 30, 8, 20, 39986) There is much to learn there.

('87', 31, 2, 3, 40295) June 1, 1945
('87', 31, 3, 4, 40308) BAPA, I have your long letter.
('87', 31, 3, 5, 40339) It does not reveal your anger but your practical sense.
('87', 31, 3, 6, 40395) However, the practical sense suggests that you should not relinquish the post you have accepted.
('87', 31, 3, 7, 40492) I had often read in South Africa the letter Gokhale wrote on his return from England expressing his deep apology.
('87', 31, 3, 8, 40606) 1 One of the sentences in that letter was: “How can I give up the office under duress when I have not accepted it under duress?” You are in a similar situation.
('87', 31, 3, 9, 40767) The only difference is that there is no pressure at all on you.
('87', 31, 3, 10, 40831) So it will be sheer cowardice to give up the post and with that the freely available opportunity of rendering service.
('87', 31, 3, 11, 40950) The tongue that calls you a coward only condemns itself.
('87', 31, 3, 12, 41007) Moreover, to give up doing service means putting a burden on Mridula, that is, on the women.
('87', 31, 3, 13, 41100) Why should you do that?
('87', 31, 3, 14, 41124) Give it up when I tell you and if what I tell you appeals to you.
('87', 31, 3, 15, 41190) The fact is Mridula does not want to give up anything.
('87', 31, 3, 16, 41245) I feel that we should leave only when she has become competent enough to enable us to give up.
('87', 31, 3, 17, 41340) In the mean time, we should retain her and encourage her.
('87', 31, 3, 18, 41398) The words of mine you quote are the only true words.
('87', 31, 3, 19, 41451) She should not consider anything as passed by me unless it has received your independent approval.
('87', 31, 3, 20, 41550) However, if she does not do that, you should ignore it but should do what you want to.
('87', 31, 3, 21, 41637) About Rs. 2,000 I clearly remember having told her that she should not consider anything passed as long as Bapa had not considered and approved it independently.
('87', 31, 3, 22, 41799) If she has employed two or three women, I would certainly be in favour of retaining them.
('87', 31, 3, 23, 41889) But if you disapprove of it, I will do the same.
('87', 31, 3, 24, 41938) I do not feel that you are giving me trouble.
('87', 31, 3, 25, 41984) Whatever the trouble may be, it will end.
('87', 31, 3, 26, 42026) I will see to it.
('87', 31, 3, 27, 42044) What remains now is the question about the office.
('87', 31, 3, 28, 42095) It is in a large measure in your own hands.
('87', 31, 4, 29, 42139) 1 In 1897, before the Welby Commission in England, Gokhale made certain statements, based on letters he received from Poona on the plague operations in that city, relating to the conduct of British soldiers who were employed to evacuate compulsorily the infected houses.
('87', 31, 4, 30, 42410) But when the persons who supplied him with the information refused to substantiate the allegations, Gokhale had to withdraw and apologize for the statements which caused indignation in England and in India.

('87', 32, 1, 5, 42836) Moreover, at the moment you want to work for Servants of India Society.
('87', 32, 1, 6, 42908) You may gladly do that.
('87', 32, 1, 7, 42932) I might, if I wanted, come to your help.
('87', 32, 1, 8, 42973) But I do not want to do that.
('87', 32, 1, 9, 43003) I have to curb many such good intentions.

('87', 32, 6, 16, 43217) KANTI, I received your letter of April 28 today.
('87', 32, 6, 17, 43266) The reason is that Kanu came today after visiting Rajkot and other places.
('87', 32, 6, 18, 43341) From Saraswati’s letter I presume that you would all be in Travancore at present.
('87', 32, 6, 19, 43423) Nevertheless I address this C/o Prithuraj.
('87', 32, 6, 20, 43466) If Harilal improves, the credit will go to the love both of you have for him.
('87', 32, 6, 21, 43544) May it so happen.
('87', 32, 6, 22, 43562) ‘‘That interpretation would be most correct which is given by the writer provided that it is consistent with the grammar and syntax of the writing.” I have added what I have underlined.
('87', 32, 6, 23, 43748) The other meaning is useless.
('87', 32, 7, 24, 43778) It is true that I do not encourage idol worship but it is equally true that I am neutral in the matter.
('87', 32, 7, 25, 43882) Kanam has also arrived today.

('87', 34, 3, 5, 45552) I am enclosing herewith the Trust deed of the Nature Cure Clinic.

('87', 36, 10, 15, 49251) Referring to his second visit to Panchgani, he said that his stay at Mahabaleshwar for more than a month had done him some good and he hoped to stay at Panchgani for a month.
('87', 36, 10, 16, 49426) But, he added, he could do so only if he was allowed to work undisturbed.
('87', 36, 10, 17, 49500) Those who wanted to see him should realize that he did not have enough time even to carry on his day to day work which was of all India importance.
('87', 36, 10, 18, 49648) He had been doing this work for 50 years.
('87', 36, 11, 19, 49690) 1 The letter though written to Amritlal V. Thakkar was sent at Shyamlal’s address presumably with a view to drawing his attention to the postscript.

('87', 37, 1, 3, 50128) They asked what was wrong with him.
('87', 37, 1, 4, 50164) His reply was that he was 76 years old and was not young like them.
('87', 37, 1, 5, 50232) That did not mean that he was an invalid.
('87', 37, 1, 6, 50274) He had strength and that was why he was there for prayers and for Harijan work.

('87', 38, 13, 18, 52079) BAPA, I followed your criticism of the expenditure on four months’ training.
('87', 38, 13, 19, 52156) As far as I remember, only one person is paid a salary of Rs. 175. Let it be 110 rather than 72. If you can find a girl, you can have one.
('87', 38, 13, 20, 52295) It takes into account all our departments.
('87', 38, 13, 21, 52338) It seems that you have not discussed the expenditure with Mridula.
('87', 38, 13, 22, 52405) I had raised an objection as regards the training instructor.
('87', 38, 13, 23, 52467) It is, however, considered that one instructor will not be able to deal with such a large number.
('87', 38, 13, 24, 52565) The idea behind estimating the expenditure liberally is that if the expenses grow, we shall not have to ask for more.
('87', 38, 13, 25, 52683) It will perhaps not
('87', 39, 0, 1, 52703) 40 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

('87', 39, 1, 3, 52818) My experience, not being of a Government department, is different.
('87', 39, 1, 4, 52885) But let us not worry about it.
('87', 39, 1, 5, 52916) Whatever goes to the trustees should be final from our side.

('87', 39, 6, 13, 53236) Purushottam Gandhi.

('87', 39, 6, 15, 53375) They want my blessings for that.
('87', 39, 6, 16, 53408) I have written to them that you are also his student and I have already given my blessings to your scheme.

('87', 39, 6, 18, 53548) He writes to say that an attempt was made during the lifetime of Pandit Khare to draw you into their circle but they were unsuccessful.

('87', 42, 8, 9, 56661) PANCHGANI, June 2, 1945
('87', 42, 9, 10, 56685) QUESTION: To my mind one of the greatest problems confronting us at the present moment is that of combating the systematic plan of economic exploitation by flooding the market with foreign consumer goods.
('87', 42, 9, 11, 56890) This is bound to spell disaster to Indian industrialization whether small scale or large scale.
('87', 42, 9, 12, 56986) And the pity of it is that our own businessmen and industrialists seem to be vying with one another in becoming glorified agents of foreign manufacturers.
('87', 42, 9, 13, 57141) Do you not think that an urgent need of the hour is the rousing of public conscience against the matter of foreign goods?
('87', 42, 9, 14, 57263) I think constructive workers should take up this programme immediately.
('87', 42, 9, 15, 57335) A countrywide propaganda for the use of village manufactured and swadeshi goods can also prove to be a very elective and economic sanction against foreign domination.
('87', 42, 9, 16, 57502) What is your opinion and advice?
('87', 42, 10, 17, 57535) ANSWER: The difficulty cannot be met by carrying on propaganda, however wide and intensive.
('87', 42, 10, 18, 57627) The first thing is to demonstrate its economic fallacy.
('87', 42, 10, 19, 57683) Let us recognize that the industrialists are not conscious traitors.
('87', 42, 10, 20, 57752) They honestly believe that their plan will bring prosperity to the masses.
('87', 42, 10, 21, 57827) They are wrong.
('87', 42, 10, 22, 57843) But how to show that they are wrong save by patient study and publication thereof and by working so as to show that the masses respond to the work and actually prosper?
('87', 42, 10, 23, 58012) This demands hard thinking, hard study and harder constructive work among the masses.
('87', 42, 10, 24, 58098) They have to manufacture for their own use.

('87', 43, 1, 2, 58230) Just picture to yourself every village producing and manufacturing everything for its own use.
('87', 43, 1, 3, 58325) This must mean some surplus for the cities of India going from the villages.
('87', 43, 1, 4, 58402) This means also automatic stoppage of all exploitation and prosperity without having to exploit the outer world.

('87', 43, 8, 11, 58758) PANCHGANI, June 1/3, 1945
('87', 43, 9, 12, 58784) QUESTION: Do you think there has been any change in the country to warrant any change in the Congressmen’s attitude towards the war which they adopted in 1939?
('87', 43, 9, 13, 58944) If you think there is no change, then has it not come to this that, in your opinion, Congressmen should not go back to ministries in the present circumstances?
('87', 43, 10, 14, 59104) ANSWER: You ask for my personal opinion.
('87', 43, 10, 15, 59145) I give it for what it is worth.
('87', 43, 10, 16, 59177) Mine can in no sense be an authoritative opinion.
('87', 43, 10, 17, 59227) You should examine the Congress attitude not of 1939 but of 1942. So far as I am aware the Congress offered help in 1942 provided that certain conditions were fulfilled.
('87', 43, 10, 18, 59397) It is for the Congress to lay down the conditions for the present acceptance of office.
('87', 43, 10, 19, 59485) These must always be in terms of independence.
('87', 43, 11, 20, 59532) 1The Bombay Chronicle, 4 6 1945, reported that on June 3, C. Rajagopa lachari laid the foundation stone for the memorial building to house a library of the works of the Tamil poet, Subrahmanya Bharati, at his birth place, Ettayapuram, in Tamil Nadu.
('87', 43, 11, 21, 59782) Gandhiji wrote the message in Tamil.
('87', 43, 11, 22, 59819) 2 ibid 3 According to A. P. I. report, Harekrushna Mehtab released “written questions and answers” to the Press after “full discussion with Gandhiji for three days”.
('87', 44, 0, 1, 59985) VOL. 87: 29 MAY, 1945 29 AUGUST, 1945 45
('87', 44, 1, 2, 60026) There is no civil disobedience now and you have placed your manifold constructive programme before the country.
('87', 44, 1, 3, 60138) Do you approve of the following definition of the constructive programme—to tackle the immediate problems of the masses and to try to solve them on non violent lines as enunciated by you?
('87', 44, 1, 4, 60326) This definition includes the work of trying to check black marketing, profiteering and also the inflow of foreign consumer goods by insisting upon the use of swadeshi goods.
('87', 44, 1, 5, 60500) You have only a partial grasp of the constructive programme of my conception.
('87', 44, 1, 6, 60578) It is comprehensive and all pervading.
('87', 44, 1, 7, 60617) Stoppage of black marketing, profiteering and foreign consumer goods must precede construction.
('87', 44, 1, 8, 60713) They are not part of the programme, but the programme to be effective and universal has to do that weeding process.
('87', 44, 1, 9, 60829) The whole programme is swadeshi.
('87', 44, 2, 10, 60862) Would you ask Congressmen to seek co operation from other parties and even from Government agencies in the prosecution of the constructive work?
('87', 44, 2, 11, 61007) How can the constructive programme be prevented from being used for the purpose of consolidating the party position for elections and for other purposes?
('87', 44, 2, 12, 61161) I have been crying myself hoarse to persuade Congressmen to adopt whole heartedly the constructive programme without party motive or any other.
('87', 44, 2, 13, 61305) It is its own motive.
('87', 44, 2, 14, 61327) I seek the co operation of the whole nation and also of the Government in carrying out the programme, naturally, on our own terms.
('87', 44, 2, 15, 61458) If the latter give honest co operation, it must mean independence without violence and without fuss.
('87', 44, 2, 16, 61559) If the constructive programme is worked for electioneering purposes it will carry with it the seeds of its own disease.
('87', 44, 2, 17, 61679) Men can prevent vicious people from using the best things for the worst of purposes.
('87', 44, 3, 18, 61764) What should be the attitude of Congressmen towards all those who are now building up an organization which may come in clash with Congress at some stage or other in future?
('87', 44, 3, 19, 61937) The Congress position should be of complete non violent non co operation with those who will stab the country in the back.

('87', 46, 3, 9, 63519) I cannot help agreeing with the Pandit that mere dismissal of the “ring leaders” does not meet the needs of the situation so far as the wanton action of the police is concerned.
('87', 46, 3, 10, 63697) And why prosecution of certain volunteers instead of an inquiry suggested by him ?

('87', 50, 1, 2, 67950) 88. STATEMENT ON SYRIAN LEBANESE QUESTION 1
('87', 50, 2, 3, 67994) PANCHGANI, [On or after June 3, 1945] 2
('87', 50, 3, 4, 68034) I have purposely refrained from saying anything on the Syrian and Lebanese question, not because I have felt less than others but because I have felt more.
('87', 50, 3, 5, 68190) The injustice is so obvious and glaring.
('87', 50, 3, 6, 68231) It pains me to think that our Muslim fellow countrymen feel that they can effectively ask for justice to the Syrians and Lebanese as fellow Muslims.
('87', 50, 3, 7, 68380) Syrians and the Lebanese are a mixed population.
('87', 50, 3, 8, 68429) 3 Their liberty is at stake not as Muslims but as a separate nation.
('87', 50, 3, 9, 68498) The struggle of Syria and Lebanon for independence should evoke the sympathy of the whole of India, and it must be made a national issue, instead of one of a particular section or community.
('87', 50, 3, 10, 68689) 4 Muslims should speak as Indians and should invite the cooperation of all India including members of all religions.
('87', 50, 3, 11, 68806) For instance the voice of Indian Christians speaking as Christians as apart from other Indians in international affairs must fall flat.
('87', 50, 3, 12, 68942) This is the lesson of history everywhere, but in India, to my mind, the Khilafat issue emphasizes the lesson which we seem to have forgotten.
('87', 50, 3, 13, 69084) The Muslims headed by the late Hakim Saheb sought the co operation of all India and the Khilafat question became a plank in the National Congress.
('87', 50, 3, 14, 69231) And it drew world attention.
('87', 50, 3, 15, 69260) Had the history of victorious Turkey been written differently, India would have taken an effective part in the settlement of the Khilafat question.
('87', 50, 3, 16, 69408) India divided against itself will have no effect on the council of the nations of the world.
('87', 50, 3, 17, 69501) The Bombay Chronicle, 8 6 1945; also The Hindu, 8 6 1945
('87', 50, 4, 18, 69558) 1 The nationalist movement in Syria and Lebanon had come into violent conflict with France which had been ruling the area under a mandate since 1923. France had called for negotiations and at the same time despatched two contingents of troops.
('87', 50, 4, 19, 69802) There were widespread clashes culminating in the French bombardment of Damascus on May 29 and 30. The statement was made in an “exclusive interview to the special representative of the Orient Press” of India.
('87', 50, 4, 20, 70011) 2 From the expression “our Muslim fellow countrymen feel”, presumably a reference to M. A. Jinnah’s statement of June 3, which assured Syrians and Lebanese of the support of “the hundred million Muslims of India”.
('87', 50, 4, 21, 70225) Jinnah had also warned that “not only the Middle East and Muslim India but also the whole of the Muslim world will flare up” if freedom was not granted.
('87', 50, 4, 22, 70378) 3 Being predominantly Christian 4 This paragraph is reproduced from The Hindu, 8 6 1945, in which it was reported independently under the date line “Panchgani, June 6”.

('87', 51, 3, 6, 70750) It is strange that no intimation has been received by you.
('87', 51, 3, 7, 70809) You are right to ignore the newspaper notice 1, unless it is confirmed.
('87', 51, 3, 8, 70881) Also of course there is no joy in the removal in the manner it is being brought about.

('87', 52, 4, 5, 71796) He appreciates your desire to have him in America.
('87', 52, 4, 6, 71847) 1 But you have seen how he could not come.
('87', 52, 4, 7, 71890) He could not force himself on the Committee.
('87', 52, 4, 8, 71935) He has not much faith in the value of more verbal talks.
('87', 52, 4, 9, 71992) He is trying to forge the message of non violence through his work in India.
('87', 52, 4, 10, 72069) If he shows visible success here the world will get the message it needs.
('87', 52, 4, 11, 72143) Therefore the conscientious objectors who are going to meet near Glendora would do well to closely study what he has been saying and doing in India.
('87', 52, 4, 12, 72292) Particularly, they should study his writings preceding and after the 8th August, 1942—Resolution of the Congress.
('87', 52, 4, 13, 72406) They reflect the working of a non violent mind in the face of the greatest crisis in the world’s history.

('87', 53, 1, 2, 73204) Manu’s mind is wavering whether to go to Nagpur directly or come here for a day on her way there.
('87', 53, 1, 3, 73302) If Dr. Gilder doesnot permit her, there will be no question for the present of her going to Nagpur.
('87', 53, 1, 4, 73402) Manu is very impatient.
('87', 53, 1, 5, 73426) Now she is obsessed with the desire to become a nurse.
('87', 53, 1, 6, 73481) Let me see what happens.
('87', 53, 1, 7, 73506) As regards money, it is all right for you to keep it with you as Manu’s trustee.
('87', 53, 1, 8, 73587) I see no need for two names.
('87', 53, 1, 9, 73616) You may insert any condition you want in the Trust.

('87', 54, 8, 17, 75059) She has settled her accounts, but suffered much while doing so.
('87', 54, 8, 18, 75123) The fact that she exacted service from you both earned you merit.
('87', 54, 8, 19, 75189) But wasn’t that at her cost?
('87', 54, 8, 20, 75218) One should not wish to earn such merit.

('87', 56, 3, 5, 76543) The meaning of your difficulty is that the political power should pass into our hands.
('87', 56, 3, 6, 76630) But a non violent political system can come about only through non violent means.
('87', 56, 3, 7, 76712) Hence whether we are one or many we should engage ourselves only in non violent activities.
('87', 56, 3, 8, 76804) One can become many, zero cannot.
('87', 56, 3, 9, 76838) My impression about the discharge was correct.
('87', 56, 3, 10, 76885) I may have written 1 the opposite in my hurry.

('87', 58, 3, 4, 78844) BHAI PROFULLA, The Working Committee of the Kasturba Memorial Trust met at Mahabaleshwar.
('87', 58, 3, 5, 78934) Your objection to keeping the entire fund with the Head Office was put up to it.
('87', 58, 3, 6, 79015) I had told you that I would write to you and clarify the whole thing.
('87', 58, 3, 7, 79085) You know that the fund raised in Bombay is kept in the Head Office.
('87', 58, 3, 8, 79153) I feel that the same should be done with the money raised in Calcutta.
('87', 58, 3, 9, 79224) The committee which is formed now is to consider how the money will be spent in the villages.
('87', 58, 3, 10, 79318) Why should we argue over where the money should be kept?
('87', 58, 3, 11, 79375) Your duty is to submit a scheme and if it is accepted, to get it implemented.
('87', 58, 3, 12, 79453) You must be knowing that the committee for collecting the money and the committee for spending it are not the same.
('87', 58, 3, 13, 79569) It is true that the same three persons are on most of the committees.
('87', 58, 3, 14, 79639) But that is our misfortune.
('87', 58, 3, 15, 79667) There are very few workers and those who give the money claim the right to have a control over the spending of it.
('87', 58, 3, 16, 79782) When they are deserving, it may become our duty to have the donors on the committees.
('87', 58, 3, 17, 79868) What more can I write?
('87', 58, 3, 18, 79891) I would suggest that you explainmy view to the committee and write a satisfactory letter.

('87', 62, 11, 14, 84005) I approve in every way your decision to resign as Secretary.
('87', 62, 11, 15, 84066) But my approval rests on the condition that you will have fully understood my advice and acted in strict accordance with it.
('87', 62, 11, 16, 84191) Man is not a lifeless machine, though he should work like a machine; he is a conscious being and while working as a machine he should work with faith and intelligence, that is to say, with his heart and his mind.

('87', 62, 11, 21, 84587) If you do only that much, though you have ceased to be Secretary, the management will remain in your hands, for your experience and patience are your own and cannot be transferred to anybody.
('87', 62, 11, 22, 84779) Those who wish may take them from you.

('87', 64, 7, 14, 86802) I can testify to it.
('87', 64, 7, 15, 86823) I can understand why Bhulabhai has accepted this case.
('87', 64, 7, 16, 86878) He has plenty of money.
('87', 64, 7, 17, 86902) We may be sure he has not accepted the case for the sake of the money.
('87', 64, 7, 18, 86973) He has accepted the case as a lawyer and has kept politics out of it.
('87', 64, 7, 19, 87043) We should be proud of it and we should pray that truth alone may triumph and if Khuhro 1 is guilty he may be proved so.
('87', 64, 7, 20, 87163) This does not happen in the courts of today.
('87', 64, 7, 21, 87208) We often find the guilty being acquitted.
('87', 64, 7, 22, 87250) But we should not give up hope on that account.

('87', 65, 2, 3, 87781) June 7, 1945
('87', 65, 3, 4, 87794) BHAI BHULABHAI, I have sat down to write this letter after the morning prayer, i.
('87', 65, 3, 5, 87876) e., at about 6 o’clock.
('87', 65, 3, 6, 87900) I saw your letter last evening.
('87', 65, 3, 7, 87932) I am writing this with the sole desire that you should retain the eminent position you occupy.
('87', 65, 3, 8, 88027) I hesitate to write because I write without any official authority.
('87', 65, 3, 9, 88095) There is a very big difference between yourlegal style and my own old fashioned one or rather between your legal knowledge and mine.
('87', 65, 3, 10, 88228) I am saying this deliberately and not through false modesty.
('87', 65, 3, 11, 88289) I learnt while studying law and practising it— and I have always acted upon the understanding—that a lawyer, having accepted the brief of an untruthful case should give it up as soon as he realizes its untruthfulness, that is, ask for a verdict against his client.
('87', 65, 3, 12, 88554) I know that there is a section of the bar which holds the opposite view.
('87', 65, 3, 13, 88627) They ask what the function of the judge would be if an advocate himself were to sit in judgment on his case.
('87', 65, 3, 14, 88736) I have always held, and hold even today, that that section is mistaken.
('87', 65, 3, 15, 88808) This is my own view.
('87', 65, 3, 16, 88829) I find the whole of your argument unconvincing.
('87', 65, 3, 17, 88877) It should be of no concern either to you or to me whether it is the question of League or the non League Muslims.
('87', 65, 3, 18, 88991) If the case of those who hold opposite views from ours is just, I would come forward to support it notwithstanding opposition from everybody else, but if a case is unjust I would not support it even if it were my own son’s.
('87', 65, 3, 19, 89215) I also believe that Bhai Khuhro’s brief should not be rejected merely on the ground that he is believed to be inciting the Hurs.
('87', 65, 3, 20, 89344) But, if after having accepted his brief and studied it, I felt that he was guilty, my moral sense would teach me that, if permitted by the client, I should plead guilty and take the punishment.
('87', 65, 3, 21, 89538) But if he should not permit me, I would request him to release me and engage another lawyer.
('87', 65, 3, 22, 89631) I remember having done that for two Muslim clients.
('87', 65, 3, 23, 89683) In one case I asked for a verdict against the client and in another admitted the client’s guilts and got his punishment much reduced and ultimately had him released after he had undergone some years of imprisonment.
('87', 65, 3, 24, 89899) I therefore do not hesitate to request you that if, after examining the papers of Khuhro’s case, you feel that he is innocent, you should fight for him, but if you feel that he is guilty, you should advise him to plead guilty or ask him to relieve you.
('87', 65, 3, 25, 90152) This is but a suggestion from me.
('87', 65, 3, 26, 90186) If, after weighing it carefully you do not approve of it, reject it.

('87', 66, 1, 6, 90538) But that is a characteristic not only of our life but of that of the whole world.
('87', 66, 1, 7, 90620) We have observed that even the most balanced men have not been able to shed this weakness.
('87', 66, 1, 8, 90711) Hence, do not pay attention to Choithram’s shortcomings.

('87', 66, 4, 22, 91429) If, however, she is keen on returning to Sevagram, let her do so.
('87', 66, 5, 23, 91495) You have assumed a fairly heavy burden.

('87', 66, 5, 25, 91622) If fortunate, you may even have a vision of God.
('87', 66, 5, 26, 91671) In any case you will have guidance in the performance of your daily duties.

('87', 68, 5, 13, 94201) My views are radically different from yours.
('87', 68, 5, 14, 94246) The small States should straightaway and openly hand over power to the people.
('87', 68, 5, 15, 94325) They should willingly meet the people.
('87', 68, 5, 16, 94364) This is the only path by taking which they can survive.
('87', 68, 5, 17, 94420) The steps you have taken will be in vain.
('87', 68, 5, 18, 94462) You yourself will not be able to swallow this draught and, even if you do, you will not be able to persuade the princely States to swallow it.
('87', 68, 5, 19, 94605) So it is better if you do not involve me in this business.
('87', 68, 5, 20, 94664) Seek Khersaheb’s advice and do whatever he says.
('87', 68, 5, 21, 94713) I see the point of Dr. Jayakar’s advice.
('87', 68, 5, 22, 94754) He has given sincere advice as a lawyer.
('87', 68, 5, 23, 94795) But I do not see my place in any of this.
('87', 68, 5, 24, 94837) I have drawn a line.

('87', 69, 2, 3, 95129) PANCHGANI, June 7, 1945
('87', 69, 3, 4, 95153) BALVANTSINHA, I had a telegram from Chi.
('87', 69, 3, 5, 95194) Hoshiari and then, yesterday, your letter came.
('87', 69, 3, 6, 95242) My advice to Hoshiari’s father is that he should not try to take her away till I come and since he has arrived in the Ashram he should await my return and share the work in the Ashram, so that he will learn something, gain some experience and at the same time not be a burden on the Ashram.
('87', 69, 3, 7, 95533) Hoshiari is as dear to me as she is to her father.
('87', 69, 3, 8, 95584) If Hoshiari had felt dissatisfied I would not have said anything.But she is quite happy there, is getting education and making progress.
('87', 69, 3, 9, 95721) The Ashram is not perfect, but it is not a bad place.
('87', 69, 3, 10, 95775) It has not done any harm to anyone.
('87', 69, 3, 11, 95811) Many have risen by living in the Ashram.
('87', 69, 3, 12, 95852) Those who are good have never felt inconvenienced in the Ashram.
('87', 69, 3, 13, 95917) Hoshiari’s father should therefore rest assured that Hoshiari will not be harmed by living in the Ashram.
('87', 69, 3, 14, 96023) The rest when I come.
('87', 69, 3, 15, 96045) Today I can but request Hoshiari’s father that if he cannot stay on there for a month, he should not take away Hoshiari with him.
('87', 69, 3, 16, 96175) If even in spite of my letters it is decided that Hoshiari should go she should not go with her father but you should accompany her.
('87', 69, 3, 17, 96308) I hope the affairs at the Ashram are going on well.

('87', 72, 8, 10, 99244) DEAR FRIEND, I had your letter of 25th July, 1944. Perhaps you are right that after this lapse of time it would not be very profitable to enter into a detailed discussion of the various points raised by your speech in the House of Lords.
('87', 72, 8, 11, 99482) There is one point in your letter however which challenges a reply.
('87', 72, 8, 12, 99550) You have adduced two passages from my writings in support of your remarks in the House of Lords that “When Mr. Gandhi called upon the British Government to quit India, he said it would be for the Congress to take delivery.” This, you have argued, connotes totalita rian spirit in the Congress.
('87', 72, 8, 13, 99844) I have seen the full text of the Harijan articles referred to in your letter.
('87', 72, 8, 14, 99922) Copies of these are enclosed for easy reference.
('87', 72, 8, 15, 99971) The passages cited by you are from the Harijan of June 15, 1940, and December 3, 1938, respectively.
('87', 72, 8, 16, 100072) You will not fail to observe that they have no relevancy to the point at issue.

('87', 73, 0, 1, 100372) 74 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('87', 73, 1, 2, 100413) is embodied in the official declaration of its President, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad to which I have referred in my last letter 1 to you.
('87', 73, 1, 3, 100548) To that decision the Congress still stands committed and one fails to see what bearing my writings in Harijan have upon it.
('87', 73, 1, 4, 100672) The fact however is that the quotations given by you are incapable of bearing the totalitarian interpretation you have put upon them.
('87', 73, 1, 5, 100806) The British Government have often declared that they would gladly part with power if there was a body in India ready and fit to take charge.
('87', 73, 1, 6, 100947) What is wrong in the Congress trying to qualify itself for that onerous duty?
('87', 73, 1, 7, 101025) That it does not want power for itself but for the whole people of India is made absolutely clear by me in the course of the same article from which you have quoted.
('87', 73, 1, 8, 101191) Here is the relevant extract:
('87', 73, 2, 9, 101221) Its non violence forbids the Congress from standing aloof and riding the high horse as the opponents say.
('87', 73, 2, 10, 101327) On the contrary it has to woo all parties, disarm suspicion and create trust in its bona fides.
('87', 73, 2, 11, 101423) Is it not the normal goal of every party in a democratic State to aspire to convert the whole country to its view and to become its mouthpiece?
('87', 73, 2, 12, 101567) Does not the party in power in the House of Commons take delivery of the machinery of administration from the outgoing party—its predecessor?
('87', 73, 2, 13, 101709) And is not the formation of coalition cabinets under the party system of government an exception rather than the rule?
('87', 73, 2, 14, 101828) Then how can the refusal of the Congress to sacrifice or water down its ideal for the sake of securing unanimity with other parties be called totalitarian?
('87', 73, 2, 15, 101984) With regard to the second passage from the article on the Princes it is only necessary to point out that it was the British Government itself that called upon the Congress to secure an agreement with the States, at the Second Round Table Conference.
('87', 73, 2, 16, 102234) There could therefore be nothing wrong in its inviting the Princes to treat with it.
('87', 73, 2, 17, 102319) The essential fact to remember in this connection is that the Congress has no other sanction except that of persuasion and self suffering, any other being precluded by its creed.
('87', 73, 2, 18, 102498) On the other hand, is not violence, euphemistically called physical force, the basis and backbone of the totalitarian spirit?
('87', 73, 2, 19, 102624) If it is, and if you believe in

('87', 74, 11, 21, 103990) Yes, but while the taking of delivery is to be immediate and certain the other is still in the future and, it cannot be denied, is problematical.”

('87', 81, 3, 6, 111338) When you cannot yourself write in English, what is the point of getting them written and then signing them?

('87', 81, 3, 8, 111472) She narrated her anguish over Harilal’s behaviour to Devdas who translated it into English and gave it to the newspapers saying that it was almost a literal translation of what Ba had narrated to him.
('87', 81, 3, 9, 111673) You must have seen it.
('87', 81, 3, 10, 111696) Such writings will carry greater weight and with that the mother tongue will also gain in importance.
('87', 81, 3, 11, 111798) I will go to the extent of saying that whatever ideas occur to you, express them as they are either in Sindhi or Hindi.
('87', 81, 3, 12, 111918) Ultimately whatever is translated into English is as useless as fruit ripened artificially.

('87', 83, 5, 8, 113991) PRABHA, I have your second letter.
('87', 83, 5, 9, 114026) You are needlessly unhappy over being released.
('87', 83, 5, 10, 114074) You have to work out of jail and even in jail.
('87', 83, 5, 11, 114121) The truth is that for one like you there is more work outside.
('87', 83, 5, 12, 114184) But what of it?
('87', 83, 5, 13, 114200) You are capable of doing it.
('87', 83, 5, 14, 114229) Do not worry at all.
('87', 83, 5, 15, 114250) Come here, if getting permission to meet Jayaprakash is going to take time.
('87', 83, 5, 16, 114326) Go from here when you have the permission.
('87', 83, 5, 17, 114369) About Father, I fervently hope that he may be relieved from the present crippled state.
('87', 83, 5, 18, 114457) My health is of course good.
('87', 83, 5, 19, 114486) I will go down from here by the end of the month.
('87', 83, 5, 20, 114536) If the spectacles suit you, then never give them up.
('87', 83, 5, 21, 114589) I keep on receiving letters saying “Prabhavati and Rajkumari must have reached there”.
('87', 83, 5, 22, 114676) But neither of you is here.
('87', 83, 5, 23, 114704) Rajkumari has not received the order from the Government.
('87', 83, 5, 24, 114762) She saw from the news papers that the restriction imposed on her had been lifted.
('87', 83, 5, 25, 114844) Even on receiving the intimation from the Government, she will not be able to come here soon as she must stay in Simla to help her brother and sister in law with their work.
('87', 83, 5, 26, 115018) It seems she will be able to come only in July.

('87', 84, 8, 15, 115877) I follow what you say about Hindustani.
('87', 84, 8, 16, 115917) There should of course be a dictionary of the words spoken in the villages.
('87', 84, 8, 17, 115993) No language can survive without a dictionary.

('87', 87, 3, 4, 118396) I did have that in my mind.
('87', 87, 3, 5, 118424) Palme Dutt is a well known figure.
('87', 87, 3, 6, 118459) He will be able to give a fight to Amery.
('87', 87, 3, 7, 118501) Patel 2, I do not know.
('87', 87, 3, 8, 118525) Nor do I wish that too many Indians should stand for election.
('87', 87, 3, 9, 118588) This is going to be an important election.
('87', 87, 3, 10, 118631) It does not matter if he is defeated.
('87', 87, 3, 11, 118669) If, moreover, I give in this case the same opinion that I did in Patel’s, it might be interpreted to mean that I am refusing to support him because he is a communist.
('87', 87, 3, 12, 118836) I have no such thought in my mind.
('87', 87, 3, 13, 118871) The distinction is worth understanding.

('87', 88, 8, 25, 120697) It can be a great thing if it can be done.
('87', 88, 8, 26, 120740) In my opinion we should fully take part in it.
('87', 88, 8, 27, 120787) And our part will consist only in accepting contributions.
('87', 88, 8, 28, 120846) We shall not give anything.
('87', 88, 8, 29, 120874) That is to say that we shall take the yarn from persons offering at least one hank of it for Narandas’s sutrayajna and give a receipt for it.
('87', 88, 8, 30, 121016) Then we have to send an account of it to Narandas every week or every month.

('87', 92, 3, 5, 125157) I was under the impression that you were in Berar.
('87', 92, 3, 6, 125208) Now you have joined the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan.
('87', 92, 3, 7, 125256) It is good.
('87', 92, 3, 8, 125268) You must be knowing my views.
('87', 92, 3, 9, 125298) I am trying to run away from the Sammelan.
('87', 92, 3, 10, 125341) From my own point of view I have broadened the definition of the national language.
('87', 92, 3, 11, 125425) I had sown the seed when I presided 2 at the Sammelan for the first time.

('87', 92, 7, 20, 125982) I enclose herewith a letter 3 I have written to Ramnath.
('87', 92, 7, 21, 126039) Send it to him.
('87', 92, 7, 22, 126055) It is good that you had been to Wardha to look for a place for the office.
('87', 92, 7, 23, 126130) It will be good if you get accommodation in the buildings of Rashtrabhasha Prachar Sabha or Bajajwadi or Maganwadi.
('87', 92, 7, 24, 126246) Accor ding to Bapa, Bajajwadi or Maganwadi will perhaps be the most suitable.

('87', 93, 8, 16, 127096) PANCHGANI, June 10, 1945 Soon after the khadi activity was started, the need began to be felt for the workers to have a scientific knowledge of all the processes of khadi production.
('87', 93, 8, 17, 127279) Therefore, as early as 1927 ’28 a school was opened in the Sabarmati Ashram to teach spinning and weaving.
('87', 93, 8, 18, 127386) As the khadi activity grew and it became necessary to pay attention to other aspects such as making khadi attractive to look at and low priced, the lack of scientific knowledge of the subject began to be felt more and more every day.
('87', 93, 8, 19, 127620) A few workers were able, through their own individual efforts and experience, to gather many useful bits of knowledge.
('87', 93, 8, 20, 127739) The tools were experimented on and improved.
('87', 93, 8, 21, 127784) All the lovers of khadi know that the late Shri Maganlal Gandhi worked very hard in this connection.
('87', 93, 8, 22, 127885) It then became clear that it was very necessary for every khadi worker to learn the science of khadi.
('87', 93, 8, 23, 127987) I have from the very beginning emphasized this.
('87', 93, 8, 24, 128035) I prepared a questionnaire about the various things khadi workers ought to know.
('87', 93, 8, 25, 128116) In 1937, I also wrote three articles for the Harijan.
('87', 93, 8, 26, 128170) In an article dated February 13, 1937, I wrote : 1
('87', 93, 9, 27, 128221) In my opinion it should be made obligatory on every khadi worker engaged in any of the production centres of the A. I. S. A. to know the elements of this science.
('87', 93, 9, 28, 128384) Following this policy, khadi schools were later opened.
('87', 93, 9, 29, 128440) A khadi
('87', 93, 10, 30, 128448) 1 Vide “What Khadi workers should know”, 13 2 1937.
('87', 94, 0, 1, 128500) VOL. 87 : 29 MAY, 1945 29 AUGUST, 1945 95
('87', 94, 1, 2, 128542) school was opened by the Central Office [of the A. I. S. A.].
('87', 94, 1, 3, 128604) The syllabi for the “spinning workers”, “weaving workers” and “Khadi Prathama” were prepared and arrangements were made to impart instruction according to them.
('87', 94, 1, 4, 128765) It was also hoped then that all the workers of the Charkha Sangh would join these schools by turns,and complete their training.
('87', 94, 1, 5, 128893) In order to save workers from any kind of difficulties, it was arranged to pay them, over and above their regular salaries, travelling allowance and other allowances since it was thought that the workers would have to spend more on food in an unfamiliar place.
('87', 94, 1, 6, 129154) One regrets however that the workers have not shown any increased enthusiasm for learning the khadi science.
('87', 94, 1, 7, 129263) Now that the Charkha Sangh has taken up the new work it becomes obligatory on the part of khadi workers to train themselves in khadi science.
('87', 94, 1, 8, 129405) Without that it will be impossible to carry on the new khadi programme.
('87', 94, 1, 9, 129477) According to the new programme, the sales depots too will almost be like production centres.
('87', 94, 1, 10, 129570) Not only that; after some time we intend to convert all khadi production centres and sales depots into khadi education centres.
('87', 94, 1, 11, 129698) It will then be unnecessary to send workers to the schools for khadi training.
('87', 94, 1, 12, 129777) We have to train in the science of khadi all the workers, new as well as old.
('87', 94, 1, 13, 129855) Those in charge of the branches are therefore requested to scrutinize the list of workers to assess what training a particular worker needs and to make arrangements for such training to be given.
('87', 94, 1, 14, 130051) Lists of workers should in this way be made and forwarded to the Central Office.
('87', 94, 1, 15, 130132) In order to make the training obligatory, we should make the rise in salary dependent on the degree of khadi education possessed by the worker.
('87', 94, 1, 16, 130276) We should also accept the principle that the khadi worker has to pass an examination.
('87', 94, 1, 17, 130362) Those who fail should not be considered qualified.
('87', 94, 1, 18, 130413) So long as we do not seriously take up the question of khadi education, how can we hope to succeed?
('87', 94, 1, 19, 130513) I have said that if we are true khadi workers, we should have as much awareness, as much knowledge and as much alertness as is considered necessary for a member of the I. C. S.

('87', 95, 8, 14, 131145) BHAI HAMID KHAN, I have your letter.
('87', 95, 8, 15, 131182) I knew Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi 2 well.
('87', 95, 8, 16, 131222) I had great regard for him.
('87', 95, 8, 17, 131250) I have already given my view on the question of a memorial.
('87', 95, 8, 18, 131310) You must know it.
('87', 95, 8, 19, 131328) Go through it if you have not already done so.
('87', 95, 8, 20, 131375) You can’t raise a memorial by constructing a building or spending money.
('87', 95, 8, 21, 131448) A man thinks that having given the money he has done his duty.
('87', 95, 8, 22, 131511) Therefore, in my opinion, it will be a true memorial to Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi if, at least in Kanpur, and as far as possible throughout India, Hindus and Muslims should unite and instead of cutting each other’s throats be prepared to lay down their lives for each other.
('87', 95, 8, 23, 131785) If this comes about, let me know and then ask for my blessings.
('87', 95, 8, 24, 131849) What is there in merely collecting money?
('87', 95, 8, 25, 131891) Let me also know who are on the Committee?
('87', 95, 8, 26, 131934) And what are the grounds for believing that what has not been achieved so far will be achieved now?
('87', 95, 8, 27, 132034) I have seen the aim of the Memorial Committee.
('87', 95, 8, 28, 132081) That will not make the memory of the deceased immortal, only bring ridicule to it.
('87', 95, 8, 29, 132164) Two or three rich men can jointly put up such buildings, give jobs to a few persons and thus deceive themselves and others that they haveraised a memorial to Vidyarthiji.
('87', 95, 8, 30, 132335) But I will regard it as a mockery.

('87', 96, 10, 22, 133499) June 10, 1945
('87', 96, 11, 23, 133513) Gandhiji congratulated the volunteers for having walked down to Panchgani from Wai in spite of the rain.
('87', 96, 11, 24, 133618) He was sorry he could not invite them all to theprayer hall.
('87', 96, 11, 25, 133679) The hall belonged to a school.
('87', 96, 11, 26, 133710) That they allowed him, a rebel, to hold a prayer meeting in their hall was the essence of the prayer.
('87', 96, 11, 27, 133812) He knew that the volunteers did
('87', 96, 12, 28, 133844) 1 According to the A. P. I. report, this is “the authorized version” of Gandhiji’s speech to about 300 volunteers at a function organized by Dr. B. D. Savant in Parsi Girls High School.
('87', 96, 12, 29, 134030) Gandhiji spoke in Hindustani which was rendered into Marathi.
('87', 97, 0, 1, 134092) 98 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('87', 97, 1, 2, 134133) not all pray.
('87', 97, 1, 3, 134147) He had been in close touch with volunteer organizations in India ever since 1919. Yet he had not been able to make them prayer minded.
('87', 97, 1, 4, 134282) He had failed to create in them an enthusiasm for prayer.
('87', 97, 2, 5, 134340) Again he had explained to them right from the beginning that a volunteer must always serve the people and serve them only through truth and non violence.
('87', 97, 2, 6, 134494) Yet there were very few men and women amongst them who had accepted truth and non violence as their creed.
('87', 97, 2, 7, 134601) He was convinced that real swaraj, that is, swaraj for the rich and the poor alike, could not be won except through truth and non violence.
('87', 97, 3, 8, 134741) They had just seen the end of a terrible war.
('87', 97, 3, 9, 134787) It had made people doubt if truth really counted in this world.
('87', 97, 3, 10, 134851) The Allies had won, but their victory had been the result of superior arms and superior man power.
('87', 97, 3, 11, 134950) He could not enthuse over it as a victory of truth over falsehood.
('87', 97, 3, 12, 135017) At the same time he wanted to make it clear to them that a victory for the Axis would have been far worse.
('87', 97, 3, 13, 135124) The Axis had accepted violence as their creed.
('87', 97, 3, 14, 135171) The Allies had not done so.
('87', 97, 3, 15, 135199) They at least paid lip service to peace and freedom, and truth and non violence.
('87', 97, 3, 16, 135280) It was true that their actions belied their profession.
('87', 97, 3, 17, 135336) A major part of humanity today consisted of oppressed and enslaved nations.
('87', 97, 3, 18, 135412) It was his conviction that, if India could win swaraj through truth and non violence, she would be able to bring deliverance to all the other oppressed nations.
('87', 97, 4, 19, 135573) Many of the volunteers were not clad in khadi.
('87', 97, 4, 20, 135620) He had called the spinning wheel the symbol of truth and non violence and therefore also of swaraj.
('87', 97, 4, 21, 135720) That was why it had found a place in the national flag.
('87', 97, 4, 22, 135776) Therefore he exhorted them all to spin and produce khadi for their own clothes.
('87', 97, 4, 23, 135856) Thus they would help to combat the cloth shortage in the country and help the naked poor.
('87', 97, 5, 24, 135946) Lastly he asked them all to learn Hindustani.
('87', 97, 5, 25, 135992) Hindustani was the language that Hindus and Mussalmans of North India spoke and which was written in Nagari and Urdu scripts.
('87', 97, 5, 26, 136118) All those who spoke Hindustani did not know both the scripts.
('87', 97, 5, 27, 136180) But those who wished to serve all should make it a point of honour to learn both the scripts.

('87', 98, 2, 5, 136669) It is also definite that if the Chimur Ashti prisoners and other such prisoners are hanged, the situation will become impossible.
('87', 98, 2, 6, 136799) Unless the League’s attitude shows a change without any expectation of gain I will have no deal with it even if the Congress Working Committee consents.
('87', 98, 2, 7, 136952) This is for you yourself to think over and decide.
('87', 98, 2, 8, 137003) You are in a better position to understand the truth than anybody else.
('87', 98, 2, 9, 137075) The distinction that is being made between the League Muslims and the others seems to me dangerous from every point of view.
('87', 98, 2, 10, 137200) I don’t think it safe to countenance any such position.
('87', 98, 2, 11, 137256) Think carefully over what you said last night regarding this.
('87', 98, 2, 12, 137318) Will the 40 per cent Congress quota include any representatives of the Hindu Mahasabha or of Harijans?
('87', 98, 2, 13, 137421) What about the Sikhs, Parsis, Christians, etc.?
('87', 98, 2, 14, 137469) Whether you have discussed this with the League or not is irrelevant here.
('87', 98, 2, 15, 137544) When the time for final decision comes, the Congress will have to consider all these points.
('87', 98, 2, 16, 137637) The Congress will not be in the same position as the League.
('87', 98, 2, 17, 137698) It will have to take into account all the interests in the country, whereas the League is concerned with the interests only of the Muslims supporting it.
('87', 98, 2, 18, 137852) You will have to be ready to face all these complications.
('87', 98, 2, 19, 137911) You will definitely not be able to bring the ship to port by disregarding the parties other than the League.
('87', 98, 2, 20, 138020) Please understand my limitations fully before you proceed further.
('87', 98, 2, 21, 138087) As I have explained, my temper is progressively becomingmore uncompromising.
('87', 98, 2, 22, 138164) I use the word “uncompromising”
('87', 98, 3, 23, 138196) 1 “In Mahatma Gandhi—The Last Phase, Vol. I, Book One, p.
('87', 98, 3, 24, 138254) 120, Pyarelal explains: “The rejection of the appeal for mercy on behalf of the Ashti Chimur prisoners at this stage hardened Gandhiji’s attitude.
('87', 98, 3, 25, 138401) Extremely sensitive to the slightest variation in the moral atmosphere around him, he became more and more insistent on the ‘present tense’.
('87', 98, 3, 26, 138542) This was very much in evidence when Bhulabhai met him at Mahabaleshwar.”
('87', 99, 0, 1, 138615) 100 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('87', 99, 1, 2, 138657) in a good sense, so take it in that spirit.
('87', 99, 1, 3, 138701) Against my indifference to the Parliamentary scheme and my increasing faith in non violent non co operation, you can safely place my loyalty to you.
('87', 99, 1, 4, 138850) It will not let myself go beyond the limits of what I have given you in writing.
('87', 99, 1, 5, 138931) But it is difficult even for me to say where my uncompromising spirit will take me, for I am coming to put ever increasing faith in the Unseen Power and, therefore, I think very little about tomorrow.
('87', 99, 1, 6, 139132) I started writing this before 6 and it is 6.30 now.
('87', 99, 1, 7, 139184) I will write more if anything occurs to me.

('87', 102, 1, 2, 142581) 176. TWO POSERS [On or before June 12, 1945] 1
('87', 102, 2, 3, 142628) Shri Sailendra Nath Chattopadhyaya of the United Press puts the following posers before me: “Why do you wish to live for 125 years, and what is Ram Rajya?” The questions are so apt and reasonable that, contrary to my wont these days, I want to answer them.
('87', 102, 2, 4, 142885) Many visitors and correspondents put the same questions.
('87', 102, 2, 5, 142942) I take this opportunity therefore and once for all, I hope, of answering them to the best of my ability.
('87', 102, 2, 6, 143047) The idea of 125 years’ life flashed across my mind, while I was speaking on the 8th August, 1942, to the meeting of the A.I.C.C. in Bombay.
('87', 102, 2, 7, 143187) I might have mentioned the same thing before in private conversation.
('87', 102, 2, 8, 143257) If I did, I have no recollection.
('87', 102, 2, 9, 143291) I am a constant student of the Ishopanishad which contains only eighteen mantras.
('87', 102, 2, 10, 143373) The first half of the second mantra means: “Only doing works of service on this earth, you should wish to live 120 or 125 years.” The word in the original denoting the number is translated by the word ‘hundred’, but I had seen just then a com mentary which took the number to mean 120 or 125. I purposely used the highest figure at the meeting, as signifying the intense wish to live the longest in order to fulfil my allotted work.
('87', 102, 2, 11, 143806) In expressing the wish I only followed my old habit of wishing to act according to the best of my belief.
('87', 102, 2, 12, 143912) Moreover, as a naturopath, I believe in the feasibility of living the full span of life.
('87', 102, 2, 13, 144001) I know that, medically speaking, the chances are against me for I have not always followed nature’s way.
('87', 102, 2, 14, 144106) I began to adopt it fairly strictly in South Africa in 1903 or there about.
('87', 102, 2, 15, 144182) Want of brahmacharya in early married life must also weigh against the full span.
('87', 102, 2, 16, 144264) My conception of nature cure, like everything else, has undergone progressive evolution.
('87', 102, 2, 17, 144353) And for years I have believed that, if a person is filled with the presence of God and has thus attained the state of dispassion, he can surmount handicaps against long life.
('87', 102, 2, 18, 144528) I have come to the conclusion, based on observation and scriptural reading, that when a man comes to that complete living faith in the Unseen Power and has become free from passion, the body undergoesinternal transformation.
('87', 102, 2, 19, 144753) This does not come about by mere wish.
('87', 102, 2, 20, 144792) It needs constant vigilance and practice.
('87', 102, 2, 21, 144834) In spite of both, unless God’s grace descends upon one, human effort comes to naught.
('87', 102, 3, 22, 144920) 1 The article appeared under the date line “Panchgani, June 12”.
('87', 103, 0, 1, 144985) 104 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('87', 103, 1, 2, 145027) Conquest of passion—passion here does not signify animal appetite; of course, it presupposes full control over such appetite—is more difficult to attain.
('87', 103, 1, 3, 145181) If it were otherwise, complete non violence would be easy of achievement.
('87', 103, 1, 4, 145255) With all my knowledge of, and effort at, non violence, I have conquered my passion only to the stage of suppression.
('87', 103, 1, 5, 145372) This involves great strain on both body and mind.
('87', 103, 1, 6, 145422) Subjugation is the real need.
('87', 103, 1, 7, 145452) It does not involve absence of feeling.
('87', 103, 1, 8, 145492) He who identifies himself with every living creature must feel for every kind of woe and yet remain unaffected by it.
('87', 103, 1, 9, 145610) Action proceeding from such equableness is far reaching, pervasive and quickest in its effect.
('87', 103, 1, 10, 145705) Naturally, it is wholly non violent.
('87', 103, 1, 11, 145742) Difficulty of attainment need cause no worry.
('87', 103, 1, 12, 145788) For, being on the right track leads one nearer to the goal.
('87', 103, 1, 13, 145848) Thus, though I wish and even hope to live up to 125 years, what does it matter, if I die tomorrow?
('87', 103, 1, 14, 145947) There is no sense of regret or frustration in me.
('87', 103, 1, 15, 145997) And there will be no anguish in me over an early death.
('87', 103, 1, 16, 146053) Nor does the wish imply slackness of effort, in view of the prospect of a longer life.
('87', 103, 1, 17, 146140) The wish, to be capable of being fulfilled, implies readiness to leave this body without a moment’s notice.
('87', 103, 1, 18, 146248) It connotes an easy fulfilment, from day to day, of the daily duty.
('87', 103, 1, 19, 146316) All strain is an anticipation of death.
('87', 103, 1, 20, 146356) Death does not mean an end of all effort.
('87', 103, 1, 21, 146398) The Eternal Law which we term God will be a mockery, if death were the end of such an effort.
('87', 103, 1, 22, 146492) ‘Hereafter’ is a mystery into which we may not peep.
('87', 103, 1, 23, 146545) We should have enough faith to know that death, after life truly lived, is but a prelude to a better and richer life.
('87', 103, 1, 24, 146663) Now for Ram Rajya.
('87', 103, 1, 25, 146682) It can be religiously translated as Kingdom of God on Earth; politically translated, it is perfect democracy in which, inequalities based on possession and non possession, colour, race or creed or sex vanish; in it, land and State belong to the people, justice is prompt, perfect and cheap and, therefore, there is freedom of worship, speech and the Press—all this because of the reign of the self imposed law of moral restraint.
('87', 103, 1, 26, 147112) Such a State must be based on truth and non violence and must consist of prosperous, happy and self contained villages and village communities.
('87', 103, 1, 27, 147256) It is a dream that may never be realized.
('87', 103, 1, 28, 147298) I find hap piness in living in that dreamland, ever trying to realize it in the quic kest way.

('87', 104, 6, 11, 147849) I read the summary at once.
('87', 104, 6, 12, 147877) The following questions occur to me: 1. Have you or your collaborators enforced the ideas given in your brochure in a village or a group of villages?
('87', 104, 6, 13, 148027) If you have, I would like full details with names, status and emoluments of workers, etc.
('87', 104, 6, 14, 148117) 2. I seem to read a conflict in some clauses of the summary.
('87', 104, 6, 15, 148178) Has not the present war shaken one’s confidence in the stability of the economic prosperity of the leading nations, and is not that prosperity co existent with the deep and distressing poverty of large units of the same nations?
('87', 104, 6, 16, 148407) 3. The tendency, according to the summary, should be to wean the villagers from their present practice and to teach them to displace their tools with “machine tools”, and handicrafts production with “mass production by the use of modern machinery”.
('87', 104, 6, 17, 148656) 4. If I have read the summary aright and if it reflects the nature of the brochure, is it not an invitation to me to stop my “numerous activities” whose one object is to secure the maximum benefit of the villages in the minimum of time with the minimum of expense?
('87', 104, 6, 18, 148921) I have always marvelled at your zeal for and devotion to the cause you have made your own.
('87', 104, 6, 19, 149012) But unfortunately our ways seem to

('87', 105, 6, 13, 149931) He must have gone.
('87', 105, 6, 14, 149950) The papers are making a lot of fuss over nothing.
('87', 105, 6, 15, 150000) Let us see.
('87', 105, 6, 16, 150012) You seem to have done well in Delhi.
('87', 105, 6, 17, 150049) It is a hard and even bad thing that a cow should have such preferences as you describe.
('87', 105, 6, 18, 150138) Is that a general rule?

('87', 106, 3, 5, 150412) COUSINS, I have your letter.
('87', 106, 3, 6, 150441) Though we differed so, there was not an occasion which I missed of seeing Dr. Annie Besant whenever I was nearby.
('87', 106, 3, 7, 150555) But to send you something is a different matter.
('87', 106, 3, 8, 150604) What is your time limit?

('87', 106, 8, 18, 150860) The invitation still stands.
('87', 106, 8, 19, 150889) I intend to reach Sevagram in July.
('87', 106, 8, 20, 150925) Write to me then and come when you have my reply.
('87', 106, 8, 21, 150975) There are some changes in the Ashram.
('87', 106, 8, 22, 151013) If I did not tell you about them when we last met, I am telling you now, that at the Ashram the work is principally physical labour of every kind including the cleaning of lavatories.
('87', 106, 8, 23, 151197) If you do not like such work, Sevagram will not suit you.

('87', 107, 3, 6, 151563) I am also constantly thinking about him.
('87', 107, 3, 7, 151604) As long as necessary, he will go on doing that work.
('87', 107, 3, 8, 151657) Isn’t that my work as well?
('87', 107, 3, 9, 151685) I liked your becoming President of the Khadi Board.

('87', 107, 8, 18, 151999) PREMA, I have your long letter.
('87', 107, 8, 19, 152031) I have explained the ideal to you.
('87', 107, 8, 20, 152066) You yourself can, by keeping it before you, answer all the questions in the same way as every student of geometry can draw a line by keeping Euclid’s ideal line in his mind.
('87', 107, 8, 21, 152240) Now try to understand.
('87', 107, 8, 22, 152263) I know the ideal, and I will, therefore, utilize the services of educated women only for the realization of the ideal.
('87', 107, 8, 23, 152382) If necessary, I will pay them enough for their livelihood.
('87', 107, 8, 24, 152441) But they will give more than what they take.
('87', 107, 8, 25, 152486) If they do not, they will be of no use.
('87', 107, 8, 26, 152526) If it becomes necessary to run a camp to train them as teachers, I will do so.
('87', 107, 8, 27, 152605) Whether I give six months or twelve months or even more to the backward class women will depend on experience.
('87', 107, 8, 28, 152716) Won’t it?
('87', 107, 8, 29, 152726) I shall not bother about that, for, since they will be learning through thecrafts, they will be paying their expenses, or will be fit to do so in the shortest possible period.
('87', 107, 8, 30, 152902) What if people believe that I have failed?

('87', 108, 0, 1, 153025) VOL. 87 : 29 MAY, 1945 29 AUGUST, 1945 109
('87', 108, 1, 2, 153068) And how can a man who is progressing towards the ideal be regarded to have failed?
('87', 108, 1, 3, 153151) Does the fact that you yourself, though you have lived in the Ashram, are not able to live up to the ideal prove that the ideal is impossible to attain or that you are unworthy?
('87', 108, 1, 4, 153329) If the admission of uneducated women to the camp makes it impossible to run it, then it will be impossible to effect progress in villages.
('87', 108, 1, 5, 153468) Even if it is proved that Acharya Bhagwat has failed or even if he shares your view, I will not be deterred.
('87', 108, 1, 6, 153577) Our mettle will be proved by our making possible what seems impossible today.
('87', 108, 1, 7, 153655) Sushila Pai is here.
('87', 108, 1, 8, 153676) I will give her this letter.
('87', 108, 1, 9, 153705) She will write further.
('87', 108, 1, 10, 153729) And now the next point.
('87', 108, 1, 11, 153753) I stick to what I told you concerning Bhulabhai.
('87', 108, 1, 12, 153802) He is here just now.
('87', 108, 1, 13, 153823) It is 6.40 in the morning.
('87', 108, 1, 14, 153850) He will leave at 10. I don’t know that those who are in prison will be released.
('87', 108, 1, 15, 153931) It will of course be good if they are.
('87', 108, 1, 16, 153970) If people are angry with Bhulabhai, they should be angry with me, too.
('87', 108, 1, 17, 154041) For he will not pursue his plan, which I know, if I disapprove of it.
('87', 108, 1, 18, 154111) I do not believe what the members of the Working Committee are supposed to have said.
('87', 108, 1, 19, 154197) And if they have in fact said that, they have done so without authority.
('87', 108, 1, 20, 154270) What do prisoners know about conditions outside?
('87', 108, 1, 21, 154319) According to my principle, they have no right even to try and know.
('87', 108, 1, 22, 154387) And even if they differ from me, what does it matter?
('87', 108, 1, 23, 154441) They will be free to do what they like after they are released.
('87', 108, 1, 24, 154505) I have no right at all to vote.
('87', 108, 1, 25, 154537) Am I not only an adviser?
('87', 108, 1, 26, 154563) Don’t ever believe what the newspapers say.
('87', 108, 1, 27, 154607) Of what good is it anyway?
('87', 108, 1, 28, 154634) If I knew that I should die tomorrow, such knowledge of the future could only do harm.
('87', 108, 1, 29, 154721) The same is true in this case.
('87', 108, 1, 30, 154752) Yes, I will say this much: Bhulabhai does not know what the newspapers know.
('87', 108, 1, 31, 154829) If so, how am I likely to know?
('87', 108, 1, 32, 154861) How can I or anyone else say what I would do in certain circumstances?
('87', 108, 1, 33, 154932) If you can guess about the future from what I am doing today, you may do so.
('87', 108, 1, 34, 155009) I cannot do even that, for I am daily coming to realize more clearly that we ruin our lives by forming views about hypothetical matters.
('87', 108, 1, 35, 155146) There is meaning only in what we do concerning what is actual.
('87', 108, 1, 36, 155209) All else is meaningless.
('87', 108, 2, 37, 155234) Don’t you still know my limitations and my approach?
('87', 108, 2, 38, 155287) Didn’t Kumarappa resign only after consulting me?
('87', 108, 2, 39, 155337) Wasn’t I a party to the offer of military help in the resolution of August 1942?
('87', 108, 2, 40, 155418) What does it
('87', 108, 3, 41, 155431) 1 What follows is in Gujarati.
('87', 109, 0, 1, 155462) 110 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('87', 109, 1, 2, 155504) matter if, while I do one thing, the others do the opposite and I let them?
('87', 109, 1, 3, 155580) And what else could I do?
('87', 109, 1, 4, 155606) I would tell you only this: that after having been with me for so long, and later staying away from me, you now behave as if you were still with me.
('87', 109, 1, 5, 155755) Even then I would advise you to observe my actions and the views I express, think over them and then do what seems to you best, feeling certain that you will have my support in what you do.
('87', 109, 1, 6, 155945) For I do not wish to make everybody like me.
('87', 109, 1, 7, 155990) My teaching is that everybody should be true to himself.
('87', 109, 1, 8, 156047) Anybody who has digested my teaching will never fall into doubt but will ever go forward.
('87', 109, 1, 9, 156137) Manibehn also is here.
('87', 109, 1, 10, 156160) I have left the rest to Sushila Pai.

('87', 109, 6, 23, 156758) A good many days have already passed.

('87', 110, 3, 7, 157266) I have written that the third clause, which I have marked with a cross may be retained as it is because the clause about the Managing Trustee is not to be left vague.

('87', 110, 8, 21, 158132) As regards the Managing Trustee, I think it would be better to adhere to the original draft which I havealready sent.
('87', 110, 8, 22, 158250) For the intention in that regard is that as long as he is alive and in a fit condition, he himself should remain the Managing Trustee.
('87', 110, 8, 23, 158385) It is for this purpose that we are taking all this trouble.

('87', 111, 7, 12, 159129) He will be.
('87', 111, 7, 13, 159141) In his condition we too would be deceived.
('87', 111, 7, 14, 159184) We have arrived at only one conclusion.
('87', 111, 7, 15, 159224) I believe that as long as he keeps indifferent health he can only be accommodated in the Ashram.
('87', 111, 7, 16, 159321) He will be a burden if he keeps on falling ill.
('87', 111, 7, 17, 159369) You were right in advising him to take meat.
('87', 111, 7, 18, 159414) He can’t give up meat under compulsion.
('87', 111, 7, 19, 159454) I will write to him in a day or two even if I do not hear from him.
('87', 111, 7, 20, 159522) It is good that both of you have returned to Sevagram.
('87', 111, 7, 21, 159577) I shall be very happy if both of you can keep well.

('87', 112, 8, 16, 160526) BHAI SHYAMLAL, I received your letter about Sailen.
('87', 112, 8, 17, 160578) It is all right about the monthly payment.
('87', 112, 8, 18, 160621) But Sailen remains ill and therefore the expenditure incurred is more; he sends money to his father also.
('87', 112, 8, 19, 160727) So it will be better to give him Rs. 200. At present he does not get that much.
('87', 112, 8, 20, 160807) He will have to be sent for treatment to Malad for a short time.
('87', 112, 8, 21, 160872) That will not be our responsibility.
('87', 112, 8, 22, 160909) He can take leave for a year and go.
('87', 112, 8, 23, 160946) If this does not seem right we can relieve him also.
('87', 112, 8, 24, 160999) On these terms I have no objection to taking him for the book keeping work.

('87', 113, 3, 5, 161377) I am of the opinion that now is the time to resort to pure satyagraha.
('87', 113, 3, 6, 161448) You have to make a public announcement of it.
('87', 113, 3, 7, 161494) But if your enthusiasm is not true and you lack the strength to sacrifice your life non violently, you may forget it.
('87', 113, 3, 8, 161612) If you want to resort to satyagraha you have to consider all this beforehand.

('87', 115, 8, 10, 163815) PANCHGANI, June 13 1945
('87', 115, 9, 11, 163839) BAPA, I have received a pile of papers from Mridulabehn.
('87', 115, 9, 12, 163896) One of those is of course about her office.
('87', 115, 9, 13, 163940) I am writing in that connection just now in the morning.
('87', 115, 9, 14, 163997) I had forwarded your remarks about the office to her.
('87', 115, 9, 15, 164051) She has raised an objection.
('87', 115, 9, 16, 164080) It is justified.
('87', 115, 9, 17, 164097) She says that if the minutes cannot be amended, then her office should really be shifted to Wardha for the time being.
('87', 115, 9, 18, 164216) I have already expressed the opinion that it is not necessary to do so.
('87', 115, 9, 19, 164288) She can keep her office wherever she wants.
('87', 115, 9, 20, 164332) If this attitude is correct, and according to me it is, then it should be included in the minutes.
('87', 115, 9, 21, 164431) If it is not included, then her office should be shifted to Wardha till the next meeting of the Executive Committee.
('87', 115, 9, 22, 164548) It is clear to me that that can’t be done.
('87', 115, 9, 23, 164591) And it should also be clear to you, because I have said that Mridulabehn can keep her office wherever she likes.
('87', 115, 9, 24, 164704) We must accept that her demand to get that change or addition incorporated in the minutes is justified.
('87', 115, 9, 25, 164808) If she raises her objection constitutionally, I as President cannot deny what I said in the Executive Committee meeting.
('87', 115, 9, 26, 164929) I want to get the work done somehow 1 because the main thing is that the work should be done.
('87', 115, 9, 27, 165023) For the sake of truth it is better to incorporate the change, if Shyamlal has not already done so, and amend the minutes.
('87', 115, 9, 28, 165145) Otherwise we should incorporate it at my instance when the minutes come up for signing.
('87', 115, 9, 29, 165233) By doing so we can wriggle out of the constitutional requirement.
('87', 115, 10, 30, 165299) 1 Literally, “I would have the rice boiled in any water that is available.”
('87', 116, 0, 1, 165375) VOL. 87 : 29 MAY, 1945 29 AUGUST, 1945 117
('87', 116, 1, 2, 165418) Otherwise I, as President, must say that it is not obligatory on the part of Mridulabehn to take her office to Wardha along with Bapa’s.
('87', 116, 1, 3, 165555) If we do so, we shall not then need any more money for the time being because as long as another resolution is not passed, the office can be retained in the Scindia House without making any payment and she should manage with as many paid workers as there are today.
('87', 116, 1, 4, 165821) We shall do as you want.
('87', 116, 1, 5, 165846) The first proposal accords more with truth, while the second is more in conformity with the requirements of the situation.
('87', 116, 1, 6, 165969) In order to enable you to understand the whole thing better I am sending you Mridulabehn’s letter even though it is marked personal.
('87', 116, 1, 7, 166102) In this connection I have to raise yet another question.
('87', 116, 1, 8, 166159) Do you in your inmost heart feel that it would be better if Mridulabehn gave up the office?
('87', 116, 1, 9, 166251) If you say that she should not leave, then we should have some clear cut decision in writing so that this confusion is cleared once and for all.
('87', 116, 1, 10, 166396) Draw up a draft in accordance with what you have in mind or leave it to me and I shall make it and send it to you for modification.

('87', 117, 2, 6, 167511) How much, theSangh itself should determine.
('87', 117, 2, 7, 167555) Or it should pay a nominal rent.
('87', 117, 2, 8, 167588) That should be left to its own discretion.

('87', 117, 5, 24, 168357) You certainly did well in going to Mahabaleshwar.
('87', 117, 5, 25, 168407) One should look after one’s health.

('87', 117, 5, 28, 168538) These are the immortal words of Narasinha Mehta: “I have done this just as a dog under a cart fancies himself shouldering the weight of the cart.” 2 My head spins going through your programme.

('87', 119, 12, 20, 171252) PANCHGANI, June 13, 1945
('87', 119, 13, 21, 171277) BHAI PURUSHOTTAMDAS TANDONJI, I received your letter 1 yesterday.
('87', 119, 13, 22, 171343) If I understand correctly what you write, you and other lovers of Hindi should welcome my new viewpoint and help me.
('87', 119, 13, 23, 171460) But this is not happening.
('87', 119, 13, 24, 171487) People in Gujarat are in a dilemma and are asking me what they should do.
('87', 119, 13, 25, 171561) A son of my
('87', 119, 14, 26, 171573) 1 In his letter of June 8, the addressee had said that he saw no contradiction between the work of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan and Hindustani Prachar Sabha and requested Gandhiji to reconsider his decision to withdraw from the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan.
('87', 119, 14, 27, 171823) Vide also “Letter to Purushottam Das Tandon”, 25 7 1945.

('87', 120, 1, 2, 171923) own nephew and many others like him are doing both Hindi Prachar work and Hindustani Prachar work.
('87', 120, 1, 3, 172022) This creates difficulties.
('87', 120, 1, 4, 172049) You know Perinbehn.
('87', 120, 1, 5, 172069) She wants to work for both.
('87', 120, 1, 6, 172097) But the time has now come for one of the two to be given up.
('87', 120, 1, 7, 172158) If what you say is right, then the need for this should never arise.
('87', 120, 1, 8, 172227) In my view, it should be possible for a person to be the President or Secretary of both the Hindustani Prachar Sabha and the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan.
('87', 120, 1, 9, 172376) That he may not be able to do so because the work would be too heavy is a different matter.
('87', 120, 1, 10, 172468) And if your letter means, as it should mean what I also say, then there can be no reason for any difference of opinion and I shall be greatly delighted.
('87', 120, 1, 11, 172621) I have gone through your statement that you sent me.
('87', 120, 1, 12, 172674) In my view the Hindustani Prachar Sabha is doing only your work and therefore deserves your thanks.
('87', 120, 1, 13, 172774) And you at least should become a member of it.
('87', 120, 1, 14, 172821) I had requested you to be its member but you refused saying that you would keep out so long as Dr. Abdul Haq did not come in.
('87', 120, 1, 15, 172947) Now my request is that if what I write is correct and if we both are of the same view, then this should be clarified by the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan.
('87', 120, 1, 16, 173095) If this is not necessary I shall not insist on it.
('87', 120, 1, 17, 173146) But at least it should be made clear that there is no difference of opinion about it between you and me.
('87', 120, 1, 18, 173251) It is no light matter for me to get out of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan.
('87', 120, 1, 19, 173322) But just as I withdrew from the Congress in order to serve it the better, in the same way if I leavethe Sammelan it will be to serve the Sammelan, that is, Hindi, the better.
('87', 120, 1, 20, 173497) What you call my new ideas are not really new.
('87', 120, 1, 21, 173544) It would be more correct to say that I am now only putting into practice what I had said when I first became the President of the Sammelan and what I clarified further when I became its President for the second time.
('87', 120, 1, 22, 173761) I shall decide finally after receiving your reply.

('87', 121, 8, 14, 174349) BHAI LALMANSINGH, Immediately on receiving Balvantsinha’s letter, I sent you a telegram 1. Hoshiari had said in her telegram that I should reply to you after going through Balvantsinha’s letter.
('87', 121, 8, 15, 174544) I could not have received that letter along with the wire.
('87', 121, 8, 16, 174603) Therefore I replied 2 to Hoshiari imme diately on receiving the letter and wrote 3 to Balvantsinha meaning it for you.
('87', 121, 8, 17, 174722) Now I learn from your letter that you have gonehome disap pointed.
('87', 121, 8, 18, 174789) My advice was different.
('87', 121, 8, 19, 174814) It is the same today, namely, that you should stay on till I arrive there and then decide about Hoshiari.
('87', 121, 8, 20, 174920) She is not a little girl; she can realize her responsibility.
('87', 121, 8, 21, 174982) She is also a mother.
('87', 121, 8, 22, 175004) Whatever you want to do you can do only after persuading her.
('87', 121, 8, 23, 175066) She is as dear to me as a daughter.
('87', 121, 8, 24, 175102) She loves the Ashram.
('87', 121, 8, 25, 175124) But I do not want to make you unhappy.
('87', 121, 8, 26, 175163) I want to under stand your view and then tell Hoshiari what her duty is.
('87', 121, 8, 27, 175236) I hope that you received my tele gram and my letter while you were still at Sevagram and that you have stayed on.
('87', 121, 8, 28, 175350) If that is not so this letter will be sent to you at Khurja.

('87', 124, 8, 21, 178237) It is, therefore, your duty to stay with them.
('87', 124, 8, 22, 178284) How can you be a burden on them?
('87', 124, 8, 23, 178317) Moreover, you are able to keep yourself in control there.
('87', 124, 8, 24, 178375) You should not, therefore, think just now of going away anywhere else.
('87', 124, 8, 25, 178446) The climate of the place also is good.
('87', 124, 8, 26, 178485) And certainly there are facilities.

('87', 125, 2, 5, 179081) Not many people can do that.
('87', 125, 2, 6, 179110) What is surprising is that Harilal has not contracted tuberculosis so far.
('87', 125, 2, 7, 179185) He had an excellent constitution and so he did not break down completely.
('87', 125, 2, 8, 179259) That you two could persuade him to stay on for such a long time is a wonder.
('87', 125, 2, 9, 179336) If he leaves you, he will go back to his old habits, and be ruined.
('87', 125, 2, 10, 179404) I kept back this reply for two days, but on second thoughts felt that I should not delay any more.

('87', 125, 6, 18, 179857) She is the organizing secretary, so she must see the letters which concern her work.
('87', 125, 6, 19, 179942) If she sees them she can hold them back to discuss them with you.
('87', 125, 6, 20, 180008) Because, after all, she has to implement the policies.
('87', 125, 6, 21, 180063) Isn’t that so?
('87', 125, 6, 22, 180078) Her argument that it will be difficult for her to function as long as there is no clarification [about the division of work] and that, if the provincial workers receive two directives, they won’t know what to do and will get nervous, also seems correct to me.
('87', 125, 6, 23, 180338) We must decide after taking into consideration all these things.

('87', 127, 8, 16, 182174) RAMPRASAD, The meaning of “It would be a different thing if you wished to do no more than what I had asked” 1 is this: I had asked you to go there for two months.
('87', 127, 8, 17, 182337) That was what I wanted.
('87', 127, 8, 18, 182361) If you stick to that I cannot very well ask you to prolong the period, can I?
('87', 127, 8, 19, 182439) Who will trust me if I go on increasing my demands in this manner?
('87', 127, 8, 20, 182506) I, therefore, wrote to you that you must leave after the expiry of two months if you stick to my demand.
('87', 127, 8, 21, 182611) Mirabehn on her own will not detain you, so the question won’t arise.
('87', 127, 8, 22, 182681) Did I suggest to you that you yourself should draw her attention about the expenses there?
('87', 127, 8, 23, 182772) If you want I will do that.Your decision about the child’s tumour is correct.
('87', 127, 8, 24, 182850) Show him to a doctor in Bombay.
('87', 127, 8, 25, 182882) Send me the report.

('87', 128, 6, 10, 183375) KRISHNACHANDRA, I have your long letter from Nagpur.
('87', 128, 6, 11, 183428) As for Balkoba, all that can be said is that there has been no steady gain from parpati.
('87', 128, 6, 12, 183517) Now we have to see how he can regain his strength.
('87', 128, 6, 13, 183568) It will be good if he does not find it too hot to be taken back into the room.
('87', 128, 6, 14, 183647) I still abide by whatever I wrote about railways, etc., in Hind Swaraj.
('87', 128, 6, 15, 183719) But that applies to an ideal state.
('87', 128, 6, 16, 183755) It is possible that we may never reach that state.
('87', 128, 6, 17, 183806) Let us not worry about it.
('87', 128, 6, 18, 183833) It is for this reason that I have said that if we do not have railways and other such facilities, we should not feel unhappy.
('87', 128, 6, 19, 183959) We should never make it our duty to multiply such facilities.
('87', 128, 6, 20, 184021) At the same time we should also not make a duty of giving up these things.
('87', 128, 6, 21, 184096) We should have a free and easy attitude in such matters.
('87', 128, 6, 22, 184153) We must use these facilities as little as possible.
('87', 128, 6, 23, 184205) There will be all types of people in our society.
('87', 128, 6, 24, 184255) There certainly are today.
('87', 128, 6, 25, 184282) We have to live with them.
('87', 128, 6, 26, 184309) Non attachment is the only proper dharma under these circumstances.
('87', 128, 6, 27, 184377) The only thing we must be careful about is that we do not deceive ourselves.
('87', 128, 6, 28, 184454) Your statement that trains, etc., should be shunned even as theft, adultery and falsehood is not correct.
('87', 128, 6, 29, 184560) The important reason for this is that even society considers theft, etc., to be immoral.
('87', 128, 6, 30, 184649) Trains, etc., have not been, nor need they be so considered.
('87', 128, 6, 31, 184710) All that we may say is that we shouldnot consider trains, etc., as means of enjoyment.
('87', 128, 6, 32, 184797) I have repeatedly pointed out in my articles where to draw the line.
('87', 128, 6, 33, 184866) Read them and if you give a little thought you will easily be able to draw the line.

('87', 129, 6, 11, 185383) Whatever you have done is right.
('87', 129, 6, 12, 185416) There was no need for you to go to Delhi.
('87', 129, 6, 13, 185458) I completely agree with you that even in case of a family there have to be certain rules to be followed.
('87', 129, 6, 14, 185563) I had written 1 to Bapa when I received your suggestion earlier.
('87', 129, 6, 15, 185628) Bapa has been in correspondence with Prabhudas and Amba.

('87', 130, 3, 5, 186203) But in the present circumstances, how can Aruna stay back to nurse Asaf Ali?
('87', 130, 3, 6, 186280) It is very difficult to reconcile service to the country and service to an indivi dual.
('87', 130, 3, 7, 186368) Very often the two are contradictory.
('87', 130, 3, 8, 186406) They have both dedicated their lives to the country.

('87', 133, 2, 4, 190742) Thus carpentry, joinery, drawing, painting, sculpture, brick laying, scientific washing etc., have their proper place in the institute.
('87', 133, 2, 5, 190878) These should not be taught merely mechanically.
('87', 133, 2, 6, 190926) But the why and the wherefore should be explained to the pupils, so that their intellect is fully drawn out and disciplined in the act of learning and working the respective crafts and arts.
('87', 133, 2, 7, 191117) Thus they should be educated morally and intellectually through these.
('87', 133, 2, 8, 191188) Secondly, if the first is carried out to the letter and in the spirit, the whole institution must be self supporting through the sales of work turned out.

('87', 133, 6, 15, 191689) I am of the view that you should not eat anything fibrous.
('87', 133, 6, 16, 191748) Hence, among vegetables you should eat gourd and similar other things in which there would be very little of indigestible matter.
('87', 133, 6, 17, 191878) The main diet should consist of milk, glucose,honey and, if you can digest it, butter.
('87', 133, 6, 18, 191965) I think even vegetables with seeds such as brinjals, tomatoes, should be avoided.
('87', 133, 6, 19, 192047) They have sent me from Coimbatore yeast made from bajra, which may be good.
('87', 133, 6, 20, 192123) The point is that you should eat only such food as will not impose a burden on your intestines, and only a small quantity at a

('87', 134, 4, 11, 193227) As soon as I read the broadcast I sent a wire 2 to His Excellency the Viceroy drawing his attention to the fact that I have no locus standi as the “recognized representative of the Congress”.
('87', 134, 4, 12, 193419) That function belongs to the President of the Congress or whoever may be appointed to represent the Congress on a particular occasion.
('87', 134, 4, 13, 193554) For several years I have acted unofficially as an adviser to the Congress whenever required.
('87', 134, 4, 14, 193647) The public will remember that I went with the same unrepresentative character for my talks 3 with Qaid e Azam Jinnah; and I can take up no other position with the British Government, in this instance represented by the Viceroy.
('87', 134, 4, 15, 193875) There is one expression in the Viceregal broadcast which certainly offends my ear and, I hope, will offend that of every poli tically minded Hindu.
('87', 134, 4, 16, 194023) I refer to the expression “caste Hindus”.
('87', 134, 4, 17, 194065) I claim that there is no such person, speaking politically, as a “caste Hindu”,let alone the Congress which seeks to represent the whole of India which is yearning after political independence.
('87', 134, 5, 18, 194259) Does Veer Savarkar or Dr. Shyama Prasad or Dr. Moonje of the Hindu Mahasabha represent caste Hindus?
('87', 134, 5, 19, 194360) Do they not represent all Hindus without distinction of caste?
('87', 134, 6, 20, 194423) 1 Vide Appendix “ Speech broadcast by the Viceroy”, 14 6 1945. 2 This was sent to Private Secretary to the Viceroy, vide “Telegram to Private Secretary to the Viceroy”, 14 6 1945. 3 In September 1944. 4 Vide also “Telegram to Lord Wavell”, 15 6 1945.
('87', 135, 0, 1, 194674) 136 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('87', 135, 1, 2, 194716) Do they not include the so called untouchables?
('87', 135, 1, 3, 194764) Do they themselves claim to be caste Hindus?
('87', 135, 1, 4, 194809) I hope not.
('87', 135, 1, 5, 194821) Of all politically minded Hindus, I know that even the revered Pandit Malaviyaji, though he observes caste distinctions, will refuse to be called a caste Hindu, as distinguished from the other Hindus.
('87', 135, 1, 6, 195022) The modern tendency in Hinduism is to abolish all caste distinctions and this I maintain in spite of my knowledge of reactionary elements in Hindu society.
('87', 135, 1, 7, 195178) I can only hope, therefore, that H. E. the Viceroy has alloowed himself to make use of the expression in utter ignorance.
('87', 135, 1, 8, 195300) I want to acquit him of knowingly wounding the susceptibilities of Hindu society or dividing it.
('87', 135, 1, 9, 195397) I would not have dwelt on this matter but for the fact that it touches the political mind of Hindus in its sensitive spot and carries with it political repercussions.
('87', 135, 1, 10, 195564) The proposed conference can do much useful work if it is put in its proper political setting and is at the very outset rendered immune from any fissiparous tendency.
('87', 135, 1, 11, 195730) Undoubtedly all invitees might appear as Indians conjointly bent on achieving India’s natural goal and not as persons representing several sections of Indian society.
('87', 135, 1, 12, 195897) That is how I have viewed Bhulabhai Liaqat Ali understanding 1 which I suppose laid the foundation for the forthcoming Viceregal conference.
('87', 135, 1, 13, 196038) Shri Bhulabhai Desai’s proposal has no such colouring as the Viceregal broadcast would seem to have.
('87', 135, 1, 14, 196139) I am not ashamed of the part I have played in advising 2 Shri Bhulabhai Desai when he consulted me about his proposal.
('87', 135, 1, 15, 196258) Shri Bhulabhai Desai’s proposal, as I understood it, attracted me as one interested in solving the communal tangle, and I assured him that I would use my influence with the members of the Working Committee and give my reasons for acceptance of his proposal and I have no doubt that if both parties to the proposal correctly represent their constituents and have independence of India as their common goal, things must shape well.
('87', 135, 1, 16, 196688) At this point I must stop and the Working Committee has to take up the thread.
('87', 135, 1, 17, 196767) It is for its members to declare the Congress mind on the impending questions.

('87', 138, 2, 3, 198885) ‘DILKHUSHA’, PANCHGANI, June 16, 1945
('87', 138, 3, 4, 198923) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your telegram 1 of yesterday received at 3.45 p.m.
('87', 138, 3, 5, 199003) My second telegram 2, acknowledging your kind telegraphic invitation, evidently crossed yours.
('87', 138, 3, 6, 199098) I am sending you this letter in reply, instead of wiring, because I am anxious that you should understand my position thoroughly.
('87', 138, 3, 7, 199228) However, I am sending you a wire 3 intimating the despatch of this letter.
('87', 138, 3, 8, 199303) For ready reference, I am enclosing herewith a copy of my Press message 4 which was issued yesterday in the morning.
('87', 138, 3, 9, 199420) I would like you to go through it.
('87', 138, 3, 10, 199455) While it is true that my position is technical, the reality of it is truer.
('87', 138, 3, 11, 199531) My official and legal connection with the Congress was deliberately, and with the consent of the All India Congress Committee, severed 5 in order to enable me all the better to serve the common cause.
('87', 138, 3, 12, 199732) This position therefore cannot be changed at will.
('87', 138, 3, 13, 199783) In the forthcoming official conference, I can have no official position.
('87', 138, 3, 14, 199856) My presence in it will change the official colour, unless I become an official representative of the Congress.
('87', 138, 3, 15, 199967) But if you think that my helpis desirable and that without being a member of the conference I am likely to be useful, I shall make it a point to be at your service before and even during the conference proceedings, assuming, of course, that the Working Committee wishes likewise.
('87', 138, 3, 16, 200247) I want to cite an analogy.
('87', 138, 3, 17, 200274) You may have known the late Deenabandhu, as C. F. Andrews was affectionately called by us.
('87', 138, 3, 18, 200365) He severed his official connection with the Cambridge Mission and the Church in order to serve religion, India and humanity better.
('87', 138, 3, 19, 200497) The position he occupied as a valuable link between India and England, whether official or non official and, between all classes and parties, grew as days went.
('87', 138, 3, 20, 200658) If I can, I would love to occupy such a position.
('87', 138, 3, 21, 200708) It may never come to me.
('87', 138, 3, 22, 200733) Man can but try.

('87', 139, 1, 2, 201020) You have suggested further consideration and consultation, both of which I have done.
('87', 139, 1, 3, 201106) I am within an easy distance of Yeravda Central prison, where Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Shri Shankarrao Dev were recently transferred from Ahmednagar Fort.
('87', 139, 1, 4, 201265) Almost immediately after their discharge from the jail yesterday they motored to Panchgani and are still with me.
('87', 139, 1, 5, 201379) I have shown them all the necessary papers and they concur with me in what I am writing.
('87', 139, 1, 6, 201468) In the task you have undertaken, of which I fully appreciate the difficulty and delicacy, you certainly need the assistance and goodwill of all the parties.
('87', 139, 1, 7, 201625) The Congress help you naturally cannot have without the Congress being officially represented at your table.
('87', 139, 1, 8, 201734) The first and also perhaps the main purpose of the discharge of the remaining members of the Working Committee will be frustrated unless you secure the presence at your table of the President of the Congress or whomsoever he and his Committee may appoint for the purpose.
('87', 139, 1, 9, 202006) If my supposition is correct, my immediate advice is that you should invite the President of the Congress.
('87', 139, 1, 10, 202113) I expect that the ban on the Congress had been or will be lifted to the extent it still exists.

('87', 152, 2, 3, 215745) PANCHGANI, June 18, 1945 This is perhaps an opportune moment to release the text of a letter 1 I wrote to the British Prime Minister during my stay at Panchgani last year.
('87', 152, 2, 4, 215917) The letter was written in the small hours of the night on July 17 at the same time that I wrote my Gujarati note 2 to Qaid e Azam Jinnah and duly posted to be sent through H. E. the Viceroy.
('87', 152, 2, 5, 216108) Unfortunately the letter miscarried.
('87', 152, 2, 6, 216145) Having waited for a long time, on September 10, 1944, during my visit to Bombay for the meeting with Qaid e Azam, I sent a letter 3 of enquiry out of curiosity, for the psychological moment had passed.
('87', 152, 2, 7, 216347) To my surprise, the Private Secretary to the Viceroy wrote in return on September 13 that the letter in question was not received by him.
('87', 152, 2, 8, 216485) As I attached importance to that letter, I sent 4 him a copy of the missing letter on September 17, 1944, repeating the request that it might be sent to the Prime Minister.
('87', 152, 2, 9, 216658) My letter of July 17 to Mr. Churchill, in my estimation, was of a sacred character not meant for the public eye, but I could contemplate an occasion or time when it might call for publication without losing the sacred character.
('87', 152, 2, 10, 216887) I, therefore, requested the Viceroy on December 3, 1944, 5 to enquire from the Prime Minister whether I had his permission to publish it in case of need.
('87', 152, 2, 11, 217041) He replied through his Secretary that thePrime Minister agreed to the publication of my letter subject to the fact that it was duly acknowledged.
('87', 152, 2, 12, 217187) The following is the text of the letter:
('87', 152, 3, 13, 217228) ‘DILKHUSHA’, PANCHGANI, July 17, 1944 DEAR PRIME MINISTER,
('87', 152, 4, 14, 217287) You are reported to have a desire to crush the simple “Naked Fakir” as you are said to have described me.
('87', 152, 4, 15, 217393) I have been long trying to be a “Fakir”

('87', 153, 1, 2, 217671) and that naked—a more difficult task.
('87', 153, 1, 3, 217709) I, therefore, regard the expression as a compliment though unintended.
('87', 153, 1, 4, 217780) I approach you then as such and ask you to trust and use me for the sake of your people and mine and through them those of the world.

('87', 153, 3, 7, 218008) PANCHGANI, June 18, 1945
('87', 153, 4, 8, 218033) QUESTION: What did you mean when you said that the Desai Formula 1 had no such colouring as the Viceroy’s would seem to have, and how do you think that the Desai Formula would help to solve the communal tangle?
('87', 153, 5, 9, 218244) ANSWER: Bhulabhai’s proposals have no colouring of caste.
('87', 153, 5, 10, 218302) There is the 50 per cent basis as between two political bodies.
('87', 153, 5, 11, 218366) If Bhulabhai’s proposals are the same as the Viceroy’s, then I am greatly mistaken.
('87', 153, 5, 12, 218450) I did not read the proposals in that light.
('87', 153, 5, 13, 218494) According to that Formula, if the Congress chose, it could appoint 50 per cent of any community, non Hindus, caste Hindus and non caste Hindus.
('87', 153, 5, 14, 218638) If the Congress is obliged to choose only caste Hindus or even casteless Hindus then it ceases to be Indian National Congress.
('87', 153, 6, 15, 218765) Asked if he was satisfied with the clarification offered by the Viceroy 2 and the Secretary of State 3 about the question of independence, he said that it was a question for the Working Committee to answer.
('87', 153, 6, 16, 218972) He had his own opinion but he did not wish to anticipate or influence the Working Committee by speaking to the public.
('87', 153, 7, 17, 219091) Q. What is your opinion about Lord Wavell’s personal efforts in solving the political deadlock?
('87', 153, 8, 18, 219187) A. No one will know unless Lord Wavell chooses to write himself as to what part he has played in this connection.
('87', 153, 9, 19, 219301) Q. What do you think about the omission of the Hindu Mahasabha?
('87', 153, 10, 20, 219365) A. I have not thought over it, but as you prompt me I begin to think.
('87', 153, 10, 21, 219435) I do not know whether it is the method of putting the Congress

('87', 154, 1, 2, 219700) in the place of the Hindu Mahasabha and treating it as a sectional or a Hindu body and if it is that, which I hope it is not, the Congress will be one to avoid the whole show.
('87', 154, 1, 3, 219876) But there is another construction also to be put upon that omission, namely, that the British Government wants to avoid the conference being based on religious distinction and, therefore, for examining the proposal they have invited political representatives only.
('87', 154, 1, 4, 220141) Against this favourable assumption has undoubtedly to be put the parity between Muslims and caste Hindus.
('87', 154, 1, 5, 220247) But I have publicly announced 1 that I believed that this mistake, however grave, is one of ignorance.
('87', 154, 1, 6, 220350) If my assumption is right, the mistake would be corrected.
('87', 154, 1, 7, 220409) Thinking along the same lines I account for the omission of the Muslim Majlis or the Jamiat ul Ulema and similar bodies.
('87', 154, 1, 8, 220530) I must not also omit to mention that the composition of the conference is a very great advance upon all similar bodies, for, in all previous conferences convened by the British Government, members have been nominated by the Government principally.
('87', 154, 1, 9, 220778) This time the members of the conference are under no obligation to the Government for their nomination and they need not vote or speak merely to placate the Government.
('87', 154, 1, 10, 220947) The Congress Premiers, for instance, are under obligation only to the Congress as those belonging to the Muslim League are answerable only to the League.
('87', 154, 1, 11, 221101) So far as I can recall there has been no such conference before.
('87', 154, 2, 12, 221166) Q. Why do you think the Maulana was omitted in the first instance?
('87', 154, 3, 13, 221233) A. Because the Viceroy thought that I represented the Congress and the people had given him cause to think so.
('87', 154, 3, 14, 221344) But I must say the moment I pointed 2 out the mistake he saw it at once and rectified it.

('87', 155, 2, 3, 221694) June 18, 1945
('87', 155, 3, 4, 221708) Mahatma Gandhi addressing a prayer gathering on the eve of his departure from here said he had planned to stay at Panchgani till the end of the month but man proposes and God disposes.
('87', 155, 4, 5, 221893) He thanked Principal Batha of the Parsi Girls’ High School for allowing the use of the school hall for holding prayer meetings and the girl students who sweetly chanted prayers from the scriptures in the evenings.
('87', 155, 5, 6, 222107) To him the hall had become a prayer house where he found peace every evening and got over the mental fatigue of the day’s work.
('87', 155, 5, 7, 222235) He had nothing to give them in return except his blessings.
('87', 155, 6, 8, 222295) They should know, he continued, that he was going away for the same purpose for which he had come up to the hills.
('87', 155, 6, 9, 222410) That purpose was the winning of India’s independence.
('87', 155, 6, 10, 222464) If he wanted to live for 125 years, or if he died that very moment, or if he went to the hills for recouping his health, it was the same thing to him so long as his very breath was dedicated to that aim.
('87', 155, 7, 11, 222668) His conception of swaraj was not mere political independence, He wanted to see dharmaraj—establishment of the Kingdom of Heaven on earth—the reign of truth and non violence in every walk of life.
('87', 155, 7, 12, 222864) That alone was independence to the starved masses of this vast country.
('87', 155, 8, 13, 222936) He hoped that those who attended his prayers did not come there for the sake of fun.
('87', 155, 8, 14, 223021) They came to call the name of God so as to be able to do His work.
('87', 155, 8, 15, 223088) To work for the independence of his hope was God’s work.
('87', 155, 9, 16, 223145) To remain in slavery was beneath the dignity of man.
('87', 155, 9, 17, 223198) A slave who was conscious of his state and yet did not strive to break his chains was lower than the beast.
('87', 155, 9, 18, 223306) He who prayed from his heart could never accept slavery as his lot.
('87', 155, 10, 19, 223374) Everyone said that this time at last the chance had come for bringing India’s independence nearer.
('87', 155, 10, 20, 223473) He was a trusting man by temperament and he took statements at their face value.
('87', 155, 10, 21, 223554) Nevertheless, they should repose their faith in prayer more than in a man’s work.
('87', 155, 10, 22, 223636) Let them also know that we were all slaves of our passions.
('87', 155, 10, 23, 223696) If we conquered them, we could easily overcome the slavery under foreigners or our own conquerors.

('87', 156, 2, 3, 223905) PANCHGANI, [Before June 19, 1945] 1
('87', 156, 3, 4, 223941) QUESTION: Is there a “Gandhian Plan”, as Prof.
('87', 156, 3, 5, 223988) Agrawal 2 will have it, apart from the Gandhian programme?
('87', 156, 3, 6, 224047) A plan necessarily involves a time schedule within which to attain definite objectives.
('87', 156, 3, 7, 224135) You have yourself formulated no such plan?
('87', 156, 4, 8, 224178) ANSWER: For me there is neither a Gandhian plan nor Gandhian programme.
('87', 156, 4, 9, 224250) But it would be too pedantic for me to object to a friend’s use of the word “Gandhian”.
('87', 156, 4, 10, 224338) Your objection to the word “plan” is technically valid.
('87', 156, 4, 11, 224394) But I am inclined to say there is no substance in the objection.
('87', 156, 5, 12, 224459) The basis of the Gandhian programme is decentralization.
('87', 156, 5, 13, 224516) But the core of planning is centralization.
('87', 156, 5, 14, 224560) Can planning and Gandhism go together?
('87', 156, 5, 15, 224599) I must dissent from the view that the core of planning is centralization.
('87', 156, 5, 16, 224673) Why should not decentralization lend itself to planning as well as centralization?
('87', 156, 6, 17, 224756) Economic planning, says Prof.
('87', 156, 6, 18, 224786) Agrawal, necessitates the least amount of State control.
('87', 156, 6, 19, 224843) Yet the plan he unfolds by no means envisages a Government which will govern least because the emphasis throughout is on State action—“the responsibility of the State is very great”.
('87', 156, 6, 20, 225026) Necessarily, communications, public health, education, trade and commerce, banking and currency, etc., must be State controlled.
('87', 156, 6, 21, 225155) And the plan clearly supports the nationalization of key and basic large scale industries.
('87', 156, 6, 22, 225246) How do these incompatible ideas fit in?
('87', 156, 6, 23, 225286) I detect no incompatibility in the idea of decentralizing, to the greatest extent possible, all industries and crafts, economically profitable in the villages of India, and centralizing or nationalizing the key and vital large industries required for India considered as a whole.
('87', 156, 6, 24, 225566) Agrawal has taken illustrations from the present.
('87', 156, 6, 25, 225616) When we have independence cum predominance of village industries in the place of city industries as at present, those who live to see that, as I hope youand I will, will face another and much healthier atmosphere and we shall see clearly what Prof.
('87', 156, 6, 26, 225865) Agrawal and we see today only darkly.
('87', 156, 6, 27, 225903) Today everything is controlled by a foreign State.
('87', 156, 6, 28, 225954) Tomorrow the State will be controlled by the people (a very vital change in itself,) and if
('87', 156, 7, 29, 226046) 1 Gandhiji left Panchgani on June 19; vide the preceding item.

('87', 157, 0, 1, 226210) 158 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('87', 157, 1, 2, 226252) Agrawal’s plan (pardon the word) fructifies, then it is obvious that the State control, though it appears to be big, will in reality be least.
('87', 157, 1, 3, 226395) Just project in your mind’s eye 700,000 villages of India dominating the centre with its few towns required in the interests of the villages.
('87', 157, 2, 4, 226537) The Gandhian programme is essentially a resuscitation of village communities, ensuring the maximum utilization of human power.
('87', 157, 2, 5, 226664) It is an evolutionary process.
('87', 157, 2, 6, 226695) Is it not opposed to a definitive State planning, unless, of course, cottage industrialization is content to be complementary to nationalization of industries which the problems of a post war India may make imperative ?
('87', 157, 2, 7, 226915) You have correctly described the programme standing in my name.
('87', 157, 2, 8, 226979) You have lifted the term nationalization from its present setting and then put a perplexing question.
('87', 157, 2, 9, 227081) I suggest your correcting yourself and examining the contents of the term in its new village setting.
('87', 157, 2, 10, 227183) The ideal is too comprehensive for our modernized mind.
('87', 157, 2, 11, 227239) Mine may be all a day dream never destined to be realized.
('87', 157, 2, 12, 227298) But that would be merely begging the question.
('87', 157, 2, 13, 227345) We see that in a single generation we have the so called impossible of yesterday become the possible of today.
('87', 157, 3, 14, 227456) You have recently declaimed 1 against the big interests who speak loud against the Government and give the lie by their support of it for the crumbs that fall to them.
('87', 157, 3, 15, 227624) It is answered that Congress itself has not been averse to befriend these big interests who exploit the Congress for their ends.
('87', 157, 3, 16, 227753) Can you not stop such exploitation?
('87', 157, 3, 17, 227789) The Congress has never been, and I hope never will be, averse to the big interests so long as it hopes to convert them to national use instead of being itself converted by them in the process.
('87', 157, 3, 18, 227982) My very declamation referred to by you shows that the big interests have to be on the right line, if they are to subserve the interests of the masses in the end.
('87', 157, 3, 19, 228144) Today they are relatively serving the foreign ruler whilst they themselves merely get the crumbs from his table.
('87', 157, 3, 20, 228257) It is unfortunate.
('87', 157, 3, 21, 228276) But all will never think and be alike.
('87', 157, 3, 22, 228315) In non violence, there is mutual conversion instead of coercion.

('87', 159, 8, 15, 230142) If you had some thing to ask somebody you should have gone and asked Sushilabehn.
('87', 159, 8, 16, 230224) She says everything is there on the paper you had signed.

('87', 162, 3, 10, 233084) In the first place, the term ‘minorities’ includes, along with the Muslims, all the accepted minorities.
('87', 162, 3, 11, 233189) This has been my own preo ccupation from childhood.
('87', 162, 3, 12, 233241) And if you are concerned solely about Muslims, I would like to say that sometimes when a Muslim was wanted he was chosen not because he was the best Congressman among Indians but because he was the best Congressman among Mus lims and represented Muslims.
('87', 162, 3, 13, 233496) I should be grieved if you did not know this, because you are a highly experienced man and a journalist.

('87', 163, 1, 3, 234360) As Sri Sarat Babu has never been tried and found guilty evidently he has been detained all these years and that too away from Bengal, on suspicion.
('87', 163, 1, 4, 234508) For the sake of simple justice Sri Sarat Bahu ought to be removed to a health resort in Bengal with facilities for him to see his relatives.

('87', 169, 2, 3, 241780) [After June 24, 1945] 1
('87', 169, 3, 4, 241804) DEAR MAULANA SAHEB, It was by mere chance that Pyarelal happened to see you.
('87', 169, 3, 5, 241881) But what you told him, if his report of the talk is accurate, is startling.
('87', 169, 3, 6, 241957) The Working Committee has not given you the right or the permission to form a cabinet.
('87', 169, 3, 7, 242044) You yourself told me that you could not do it without the Working Committee.
('87', 169, 3, 8, 242121) That is my view too.
('87', 169, 3, 9, 242142) That was why I had said that you should form a small committee with the assistance of the Working Committee, which could be given that right and then act through that committee or the Working Committee itself.
('87', 169, 3, 10, 242352) Since you did not react favourably to either of the proposals, I can only conclude that I do not understand or do not know the stand of the Working Committee in the matter.
('87', 169, 3, 11, 242525) 2 I understand from what Jamnalalji says that you are going to summon the Working Committee anyhow.
('87', 169, 3, 12, 242625) I consider it improper.
('87', 169, 3, 13, 242649) I would not wish you to be guilty of such a grave error at this juncture.
('87', 169, 3, 14, 242723) I do not know what you have done and how you could persuade the Viceroy.
('87', 169, 3, 15, 242796) Even if you have committed yourself it is, in my view, your duty to inform him that a mistake has been committed.
('87', 169, 3, 16, 242910) So much for the matter between you and the Working Committee.
('87', 169, 3, 17, 242972) Another thing I would like to tell you is that in anything you do, you should take with you the Congress who are present and you should put everything in writing.
('87', 169, 3, 18, 243135) The third is a personal matter.
('87', 169, 3, 19, 243167) Ever since I first heard the Viceroy’s proclamation 3, that is, while I was still at Panchgani, I have been shouting that the Congress cannot accept the principle of parity between Muslims and non Harijan Hindus, an organization of Hindus alone.
('87', 169, 3, 20, 243413) Even if I am the only one among crores to do so, I shall refuse to be a party to it.
('87', 169, 3, 21, 243498) I do not care if the negotiations break down on this, for I know and believe that the moment you try to form a national government at the centre in this way you will be laying a wrong

('87', 176, 3, 5, 251450) Whatever you are doing, you are doing with deliberation.

('87', 176, 8, 13, 251718) BHAI KAILASHNATH KATJU, I have your first Hindustani letter.
('87', 176, 8, 14, 251779) I liked it very much.
('87', 176, 8, 15, 251801) The handwriting is good, as is of course the language.
('87', 176, 8, 16, 251856) The letter from Vilas disappointed me.
('87', 176, 8, 17, 251895) 1 If you can help her to improve, do so.
('87', 176, 8, 18, 251936) I finished reading your booklet 2 yesterday.
('87', 176, 8, 19, 251981) I read it from beginning to end without leaving out anything.
('87', 176, 8, 20, 252043) I liked it but I think it has shortcomings.
('87', 176, 8, 21, 252087) In this connection I would advise you to read a big book 3 Satish Babu has written on the cow.
('87', 176, 8, 22, 252182) The first part of it is already published, the second is about to come out.
('87', 176, 8, 23, 252258) His full address is .
('87', 176, 9, 24, 252280) Calcutta.
('87', 176, 9, 25, 252290) He is a first class chemist.
('87', 176, 9, 26, 252319) But he gave up everything long back and took up khadi work.
('87', 176, 9, 27, 252379) He is very industrious.
('87', 176, 9, 28, 252403) He wrote this book in jail.
('87', 176, 9, 29, 252431) Those who want to work in the villages should read this book.
('87', 176, 9, 30, 252493) It does not contain only Satis Babu’s views.
('87', 176, 9, 31, 252538) He has taken every thing from British and American reports.
('87', 176, 9, 32, 252598) There is much scope forimprovement and addition in what you say in your book about cattle, cattle diseases and land.
('87', 176, 9, 33, 252715) If the villagers have to depend on

('87', 177, 1, 2, 253016) Government veterinary doctors for treatment of their cattle, it is not going to work.
('87', 177, 1, 3, 253102) This does not mean that the villagers are not to take their help but their knowledge should be adapted to village conditions.
('87', 177, 1, 4, 253228) I have plenty of material on the subject but I do not want to give it here.
('87', 177, 1, 5, 253304) Perhaps you know Dhiren Mazumdar.
('87', 177, 1, 6, 253338) He is working in U.P. with Vichitra Narayan.
('87', 177, 1, 7, 253383) He is Acharya Kripalani’s man and is very industrious.
('87', 177, 1, 8, 253438) He knows his work well.
('87', 177, 1, 9, 253462) If you have not already met him, do so.
('87', 177, 1, 10, 253502) If possible go and see the Khadi Pratishthan of Satis Babu and then bring out a second edition.
('87', 177, 1, 11, 253598) It will not be of much use as it is.
('87', 177, 1, 12, 253635) Now that people have become interested in the subject they will buy your book and probably read it, too.
('87', 177, 1, 13, 253740) However, they will not be able to derive much benefit from it, for, though they will know from the book what they have to do, it will not tell them how they are to do it.
('87', 177, 1, 14, 253911) This I will expect in the second edition.
('87', 177, 1, 15, 253953) I have seen from your book that you are interested in the subject and so I have offered the suggestions.
('87', 177, 1, 16, 254058) One thing more.
('87', 177, 1, 17, 254074) Take up at least one village, as I have taken up Sevagram.
('87', 177, 1, 18, 254133) Then put into practice the things you have said in the book.
('87', 177, 1, 19, 254194) In this way you will gain experience.
('87', 177, 1, 20, 254232) This suggestion of mine has another consequence: You will have to do very little legal practice.
('87', 177, 1, 21, 254329) You must be knowing that Brijkishore Babu, Rajendra Babu, Vallabhbhai and others had to totally give up their practice when they took up such work.
('87', 177, 1, 22, 254477) I do not suggest that you go so far.
('87', 177, 1, 23, 254514) You have a vast knowledge of law and have gained so much experience.
('87', 177, 1, 24, 254583) So with slight modifications do as Motilal had done.
('87', 177, 1, 25, 254636) While staying in a village take up two or three good cases.
('87', 177, 1, 26, 254696) Take the cases of the poor free of charge.
('87', 177, 1, 27, 254739) Devote the rest of your time to village reform.
('87', 177, 1, 28, 254787) This is all I can say after going through your book.

('87', 178, 3, 4, 255047) SUSHILA, How can I advice you?
('87', 178, 3, 5, 255078) These are my views: These days educated men take advantage of the blind faith of women.
('87', 178, 3, 6, 255166) Truthful women will give up their immoral and unfaithful husbands.
('87', 178, 3, 7, 255233) Even educated women do not have self respect and do not keep away from licentiousness.
('87', 178, 3, 8, 255320) A woman indulging in lechery is certainly lecherous but the one who puts up with lechery is also lecherous.
('87', 178, 3, 9, 255428) If you can take anything from this you are welcome.

('87', 183, 6, 9, 261418) BHAI MOHAMMED YASIN, I have gone through your letter.
('87', 183, 6, 10, 261472) If Pyarelal cannot give you satisfaction, then I can’t do anything more because I do not have the time.
('87', 183, 6, 11, 261576) I have heard everything you have to say, so please give up the desire for a personal discussion with me.
('87', 183, 6, 12, 261681) The real thing is work, and work alone, and the most important work is plying the charkha oneself and persuading others to ply it.
('87', 183, 6, 13, 261812) This means that one has to learn and use in practice all the processes from growing cotton to spinning the yarn.

('87', 184, 2, 3, 262399) [June 27, 1945] 2
('87', 184, 3, 4, 262417) Addressing the prayer meeting Mahatma Gandhi said that the object of attending prayers was to commune with God and turn the searchlight inwards so that with the help of God they could overcome their weaknesses.
('87', 184, 3, 5, 262628) He believed that one imbibed pure thoughts in the company of the pure.
('87', 184, 3, 6, 262699) Even if there was one pure man in that gathering, the rest would be affected by that one man’s purity.
('87', 184, 3, 7, 262802) The condition was that they came with that intention.
('87', 184, 3, 8, 262856) Otherwise, their coming to the prayers was meaningless.
('87', 184, 3, 9, 262912) He went further and maintained that even if all had their weaknesses but came to the meeting with the intention of removing them, their co operative effort made day to day would quicken the progress of reform.
('87', 184, 3, 10, 263122) For even as co operation was necessary, in the economic or the political field so was co operation much more necessary on the moral plane.
('87', 184, 3, 11, 263261) That was the meaning of the prayer meetings he had been holding since his return to India.
('87', 184, 4, 12, 263352) Therefore, he appealed to them to sit absolutely quiet, with closed eyes, so as to shut themselves off from outward thoughts for a few minutes at least.
('87', 184, 4, 13, 263505) This co operative prayer needed no fuss, no advertisement.
('87', 184, 4, 14, 263564) They must be free from hypocrisy.

('87', 185, 3, 5, 264193) I have some cases given to me by Dr. Rajendra Prasad of the Working Committee.
('87', 185, 3, 6, 264272) The Chimur cases you perhaps know.
('87', 185, 3, 7, 264307) I do not quite know how the last stages of the conference are shaping.
('87', 185, 3, 8, 264378) Be that as it may, I suggest that all such hangings be commuted to life sentences without further public appeal or agitation and whether judicial proceedings are going on or not.
('87', 185, 3, 9, 264557) If you think that this is beyond you, may I suggest that these be postponed so as to be dealt with by the national government that is coming into being?

The Committee was to meet again on August 9, but early that morning the leaders were arrested.

('87', 187, 3, 4, 267265) BHAI GOVIND BALLABH PANT 1, Yesterday I came to know that you had gone to Rajaji’s house and there all of a sudden felt giddy.
('87', 187, 3, 5, 267392) I was given to understand that in any case you were not feeling too fit and that partly I was responsible for it.
('87', 187, 3, 6, 267506) That should not be so.
('87', 187, 3, 7, 267529) I am very firm in my view and I should be so.
('87', 187, 3, 8, 267575) There may be occasions when you do not agree with my views.
('87', 187, 3, 9, 267635) So what?
('87', 187, 3, 10, 267644) All of us, if we want to serve the country, should have our own opinions.
('87', 187, 3, 11, 267718) Only then can the country forge ahead and a way be shown to the people.
('87', 187, 3, 12, 267790) I firmly believe that you should not work at the cost of your health.
('87', 187, 3, 13, 267860) Stop worrying and do not feel unhappy that you do not agree with my views.
('87', 187, 3, 14, 267935) The more I think the more convinced I become that if the Working Committee tries to select as many Hindus as there areMuslims then the communal poison will spread throughout the country and we will never be able to win freedom.
('87', 187, 3, 15, 268163) What is the harm if the Congress is reduced from a majority to a minority?
('87', 187, 3, 16, 268238) Must we do a wrong thing to maintain our majority?
('87', 187, 3, 17, 268289) Will not the Congress become a communal organization by selecting as many Hindus as there are Muslims?
('87', 187, 3, 18, 268392) If the Congress takes the fewest of Hindus, and as many as possible from the other communities, the communal poison will be removed and it will succeed in bringing freedom nearer.
('87', 187, 3, 19, 268572) I quite see that now the first step towards freedom has to be taken through the Government.
('87', 187, 3, 20, 268664) The course should be straight so far as we are concerned.
('87', 187, 3, 21, 268722) If people do not accept this, then let the reins of Government be passed to those whom the people approve.
('87', 187, 3, 22, 268829) Everything will be all right even if there are only a few straightforward persons.
('87', 187, 3, 23, 268912) This is my opinion and I can never give it up.

('87', 188, 5, 9, 269620) SIMLA, June 29, 1945
('87', 188, 6, 10, 269641) In reply to my questions, Gandhiji said be was feeling well and that the 7,000 foot altitude of Simla had not affected him so far, although he was watchful that he did not overstrain his heart.
('87', 188, 7, 11, 269835) Answering an initial request that he should give a report on the negotiations as they stood at the moment, Mahatma Gandhi said: I wish I could, but I am here only as an adviser.
('87', 188, 7, 12, 270013) I have, for many years, been advising the Congress.
('87', 188, 7, 13, 270065) But now, I have constituted myself as an adviser both to the Congress and to the Viceroy, too, and through him of the British people.
('87', 188, 7, 14, 270199) You see, that makes my position exceptionally delicate.
('87', 188, 7, 15, 270255) The only information I have is what my colleagues bring when they come to me.
('87', 188, 7, 16, 270333) Frankly speaking, I do not know in what position the conference exactly is today.
('87', 188, 7, 17, 270415) It has never been my habit to cry out of curiosity.
('87', 188, 8, 18, 270467) It was suggested that the Congress representatives should keep him advised almost hourly, to which he replied: They do, and they do not.
('87', 188, 8, 19, 270604) Unless the Viceroy wants my advice, I would know nothing as to what is happening at that end.
('87', 188, 8, 20, 270698) But, if things go on smoothly, he does not need my advice.
('87', 188, 8, 21, 270757) On our side too, while they do come to me, it need not be from day to day or hour to hour.
('87', 188, 8, 22, 270848) While, therefore, I cannot tell you what exactly the situation in the conference is, I can only share with you my hope and prayer that things will come right both for India and Great Britain.
('87', 188, 8, 23, 271040) I say for both, because I do not know that, even if a settlement is pulled through, it will be on right lines.
('87', 188, 8, 24, 271151) But I give you a tip.
('87', 188, 8, 25, 271173) I was not joking when I made a statement 1
('87', 188, 9, 26, 271216) some time back in answer to Sir Feroz Khan Noon at San Francisco,
('87', 188, 10, 27, 271282) 1 Vide “Statement to the press”, 4 5 1945.
('87', 189, 0, 1, 271325) 190 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('87', 189, 1, 2, 271367) that Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru is my heir.
('87', 189, 1, 3, 271408) He has got ability, knowledge and close touch with the public here and can interpret India’s mind.
('87', 189, 1, 4, 271507) I have already, as I wrote 1 to Lord Linlithgow, taken him as my guide in international affairs.
('87', 189, 1, 5, 271604) He can interpret India’s mind to the outside world as no one else can.
('87', 189, 1, 6, 271675) This much I can say, that Congress can never become sectional organization.
('87', 189, 1, 7, 271751) Not that there are not communal minded people in it, but the Congress can never work communally.
('87', 189, 1, 8, 271848) Therefore, normally speaking, the parity principle should be distasteful to everybody.
('87', 189, 2, 9, 271935) Turning to the composition of the current conference, Gandhiji declared it was “political in its complexion” and not communal.
('87', 189, 2, 10, 272062) This was in direct contradiction to the Muslim League argument that the whole conference was chosen on communal basis.
('87', 189, 2, 11, 272181) If they wanted various groups to be represented communally, they should have invited the Hindu Mahasabha and not the Congress, which has always been, and is now, a purely political body trying to think and act in terms of the whole nation.
('87', 189, 2, 12, 272421) It cannot belie its entire history at this critical moment.
('87', 189, 3, 13, 272481) Asked if an acceptance of invitation to work for an interim government was in the belief that it was a step towards independence, Gandhiji replied: The acceptance of the invitation was a recognition of the fact that it was a step towards independence.
('87', 189, 3, 14, 272733) But this was subjectto explanation and clarification of what was in the Viceroy’s mind.
('87', 189, 3, 15, 272821) It was like sitting on the top of a volcano which might erupt.
('87', 189, 3, 16, 272884) I took that risk.
('87', 189, 4, 17, 272902) Toward the end of the interview, it was suggested that Mr. Jinnah, President of the Muslim League, was reported to be somewhat resentful that Gandhiji had withdrawn from the conference.
('87', 189, 4, 18, 273088) If Mr. Jinnah wants me there, he can take me there.
('87', 189, 4, 19, 273140) We shall both go arm in arm.
('87', 189, 4, 20, 273169) He can help me up the hill and save strain on my heart.
('87', 189, 4, 21, 273225) Such a gesture on Mr. Jinnah’s part would mean that he wants a settlement even in the teeth of the differences and obstacles that face the conference.
('87', 189, 4, 22, 273376) You can tell him that I am quite willing to be taken to the conference by him.
('87', 189, 5, 23, 273455) I suggested that not only Mr. Jinnah, but Lord Wavell, most of India and all observers at the conference looked upon Gandhiji as head of the Congress regardless of the technicality that he was not a member, and that no settlement would be reached

('87', 190, 1, 2, 273791) without his consent.
('87', 190, 1, 3, 273812) Gandhiji replied: That is both right and wrong.
('87', 190, 1, 4, 273860) That impression has been created because generally my advice is accepted.
('87', 190, 1, 5, 273934) But technically and substantially it is wrong.
('87', 190, 1, 6, 273981) The conference is legally representative and, therefore, I can have no place in it.
('87', 190, 2, 7, 274065) To my insistence that his was the controlling voice in the Congress, Gandhiji replied: Not even that.
('87', 190, 2, 8, 274167) They can shunt me out at any time, brush aside my advice.
('87', 190, 2, 9, 274225) If I tried to override them, I might succeed for once.
('87', 190, 2, 10, 274280) But the moment I try to cling to power, I fall, never to rise again.

('87', 190, 6, 17, 274610) 23 I on my part have put uncle in your hands in the hope that he will get well.
('87', 190, 6, 18, 274690) For the sake of his treatment certainly be firm with him.
('87', 190, 6, 19, 274748) I wrote this letter long back in Panchgani.
('87', 190, 6, 20, 274792) I did not post it as I left the place.
('87', 190, 6, 21, 274831) Now I wish to inquire about uncle and Sailen.
('87', 190, 6, 22, 274877) 3 Give whatever treatment you think fit to Sailen.
('87', 190, 6, 23, 274928) Both of them should get well.
('87', 190, 6, 24, 274958) I will have to think about your expenses.
('87', 190, 6, 25, 275000) Sailen should write to me.
('87', 190, 6, 26, 275027) Please show this to him.

('87', 192, 9, 15, 276380) P. or S. or M. may give you.
('87', 192, 9, 16, 276409) You have given in your postcard as much as you could include in it.
('87', 192, 9, 17, 276477) I am writing this after the prayer, since I do not feel like returning to bed.
('87', 192, 9, 18, 276556) My work here has been prolonged.
('87', 192, 9, 19, 276589) But I do hope that it will end well.
('87', 192, 9, 20, 276626) I had a letter from Manu 1 from Poona.
('87', 192, 9, 21, 276665) She expresses confidence that she will be fully restored.
('87', 192, 9, 22, 276723) There is [however] no letter from Vanu 2. I set great store by the purification of the atmosphere there.
('87', 192, 9, 23, 276828) Purification includes cultivation of knowledge and devotion, diligence, perseverance in the path of dharma, etc.
('87', 192, 9, 24, 276941) Both of you should ponder over this.
('87', 192, 9, 25, 276978) Write to me and ask me.
('87', 192, 9, 26, 277002) I had wanted to return there in the first week of July, but that will not be possible now.
('87', 192, 9, 27, 277093) That is why I am writing this letter.

('87', 193, 3, 6, 277778) As to the second, I will not leave Simla without knowing that you no longer want me.
('87', 193, 3, 7, 277863) Whenever you need me, you have only to send me a message.
('87', 193, 3, 8, 277921) I hope you have noticed that Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru is reaching Simla tomorrow and that you will invite him to meet you and Lady Wavell.

('87', 193, 8, 15, 278336) Now it is your responsibility to see that Mahendra does not squander money.
('87', 193, 8, 16, 278412) I had the same relationswith Kevalrambhai as I had with your father.
('87', 193, 8, 17, 278481) Then both of them left.

('87', 194, 5, 9, 279320) SIMLA, June 30, 1945
('87', 194, 6, 10, 279341) GANDHIJI: I have registered your claim but have nothing to say.
('87', 194, 6, 11, 279405) I generally don’t speak during day but for your sake I am speaking to you as a special case.
('87', 194, 6, 12, 279498) You have to prompt me.
('87', 194, 7, 13, 279521) CORRESPONDENT: What will be the composition of the interim government if you have your way?
('87', 194, 8, 14, 279613) G. (Laughing) The interim government will consist of top men, irrespective of caste, creed or colour.
('87', 194, 8, 15, 279715) If I became the Viceroy of India, I would startle the world with my list and yet make it acceptable.
('87', 194, 9, 16, 279816) I asked Mahatmaji to explain what he meant by top men, and he amplified his remark by saying that he meant men and women who are fittest to do the work the country needs.
('87', 194, 9, 17, 279987) The Mahatma said: Of course, nobody will take the trouble of appointing me the Viceroy of India nor of electing me as President of the Congress—for I am not even a four anna member of the Congress to be eligible for election—with full authority to appoint the new government.
('87', 194, 10, 18, 280263) Mahatma Gandhi said that he would not hesitate to leave out anyone at present in the Congress, if he felt that better men were available outside who would work in their respective spheres so as to bring full independence at the earliest time possible.
('87', 194, 10, 19, 280515) I next asked:
('87', 194, 11, 20, 280529) In the course of your correspondence with the Viceroy on his proposals, you objected to the term “caste Hindus” in the matter of parity of representation for Hindus and Muslims, adding that if this parity between caste Hindus and Muslims was
('87', 194, 12, 21, 280771) 1 According to the source, Gandhiji jokingly said this when A. S. Bharatan, Special Correspondent of the Associated Press of India, greeted him.
('87', 194, 12, 22, 280916) “Mahatma Gandhi .
('87', 194, 12, 23, 280934) seated on a simple mattress on a raised platform in a room overlooking ...
('87', 194, 12, 24, 281009) the snow capped Himalayan.
('87', 194, 12, 25, 281036) ranges.
('87', 194, 12, 26, 281044) was actually enjoying the magnificent scenery in front of him.”

('87', 195, 1, 2, 281150) unalterable, then the Congress would have no place in the new Government.
('87', 195, 2, 3, 281224) According to the reports, the Congress delegates to the Conference have accepted parity between Hindus other than Scheduled Classes and Muslims.
('87', 195, 2, 4, 281369) Have you any comment to make on this?
('87', 195, 2, 5, 281407) If Congressmen have accepted parity, it cannot be in the sense you imagine.
('87', 195, 2, 6, 281483) I interpret the Viceregal pronouncement 2 to mean that neither community can ask for more representation than the other in the national cabinet.
('87', 195, 2, 7, 281628) Thus Hindus other than the Scheduled Classes can, if they wish, be less but not more than the Muslims.
('87', 195, 3, 8, 281731) Do you approve of the procedure suggested by Lord Wavell yesterday at the leaders’ conference for the selection of the new Executive Council, namely, that all parties should submit separate panels of names to the Viceroy first and that thereafter he would consult Party leaders before making his final selection and place the personnel finally selected by him before the conference for approval?
('87', 195, 3, 9, 282127) The procedure suggested by Lord Wavell is, in my opinion, good inasmuch as the Viceroy does not seek to impose his will on the conference.
('87', 195, 3, 10, 282266) The Viceroy has said in his opening remarks to the delegates that the various elements represented in the conference should regard him, the Viceroy, as their leader.
('87', 195, 3, 11, 282432) It is a good and dignified expression that Lord Wavell has used.
('87', 195, 3, 12, 282497) He thus acts at the conference as its leader and not as the agent of Whitehall.

('87', 196, 8, 22, 284029) How, then, can we meet?
('87', 196, 8, 23, 284053) I have already written 1 to you to persuade Hoshiari and take her with you.
('87', 196, 8, 24, 284129) Hoshiari’s children should be allowed to stay with her.
('87', 196, 8, 25, 284185) One of our bad practices is that we suppress women while men have their freedom.
('87', 196, 8, 26, 284266) What would you have done if she had been a boy?
('87', 196, 8, 27, 284314) But I do not wish to try and convince you more fully through a letter.

('87', 198, 7, 13, 286268) SIMLA, July 2, 1945 In or about the year 1902, I, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, then of Johannesburg, Attorney, bought a piece of property about 100 acres in two lots, popularly known as the Phoenix Settlement, for benevolent purposes.

('87', 201, 8, 13, 290704) The first I wrote to Bishop Westcott, the second to the ailing Narendra Dev and this third I am writing to you.
('87', 201, 8, 14, 290816) Doesn’t the ˜æè look like Öè ?
('87', 201, 8, 15, 290847) Can a pot have its neck reshaped after it is baked?
('87', 201, 8, 16, 290899) But I wonder whether this saying can be applied to a living pot.
('87', 201, 8, 17, 290964) It must of course have been first used by a wiseacre for an old man.
('87', 201, 8, 18, 291033) So much for joking, though not quite without meaning.
('87', 201, 8, 19, 291087) Though I am engaged here in an important work, all the same the mind is filled with supreme peace.
('87', 201, 8, 20, 291186) My window opens on the Himalayas.
('87', 201, 8, 21, 291220) As soon as it was known that I would have to stay here for fifteen days, the mind turned to this spectacle.
('87', 201, 8, 22, 291328) Since the house was built for men accustomed to sitting in chairs, one can see nothing if one squats on the floor.
('87', 201, 8, 23, 291443) I, therefore, became shameless and seated myself on a bench.
('87', 201, 8, 24, 291504) Now the eyes are stuck on the scene, so is the mind.
('87', 201, 8, 25, 291557) Even while lying on the bench I can see something of the spectacle.
('87', 201, 8, 26, 291625) On a clear day, the hills are covered with snow.
('87', 201, 8, 27, 291674) For a spectacle better than this, one must go to Shivji’s Kailas!
('87', 201, 8, 28, 291740) My Kailas, however, is Sevagram.

('87', 203, 7, 16, 293762) July 2, 1945
('87', 203, 8, 17, 293775) Mahatma Gandhi drew the attention of the people to the new rule of the A. I. S. A. according to which payment for khadi had to be made partly in yarn.
('87', 203, 8, 18, 293926) This rule had come into force from the first of July in Simla.
('87', 203, 8, 19, 293989) People had said to him that Simla Khadi Bhandar sold khadi to all sorts of people who came up for short or long visits.
('87', 203, 8, 20, 294109) Most of them could not spin and the sales of the Bhandar would go down if part payment of the price of khadi in yarn was insisted upon.
('87', 203, 8, 21, 294245) He did not mind such a result, untoward though it would be.
('87', 203, 9, 22, 294305) There was a time, Gandhiji said, when they aimed at promoting the sale of khadi to help the poor to supplement their income.
('87', 203, 9, 23, 294430) But deep thought, especially during his recent incarceration, had convinced him that if khadi was to serve as a means of bringing swaraj, its scope and meaning had to be extended.
('87', 203, 9, 24, 294610) He could not keep a mighty organization like the A. I. S. A. merely for producing and selling khadi for the sake of providing economic relief.
('87', 203, 9, 25, 294753) Any other occupation could be utilized for that purpose.
('87', 203, 9, 26, 294810) If khadi was to bring swaraj through non violence, millions had to spin with the full consciousness of its implication in terms of ahimsa and independence.
('87', 203, 9, 27, 294966) The A. I. S. A. had started by asking for yarn worth only two pice for every rupee worth of khadi sold.
('87', 203, 9, 28, 295070) If he could carry conviction, he would insist upon the full payment being made in yarn.
('87', 203, 9, 29, 295158) If they loved freedom, they should not find it burdensome to do that much—those who did not wish to be free had no business to
('87', 203, 10, 30, 295285) 1 The reference is to Jawaharlal Nehru; ‘jawahar’, literally, means jewel.

('87', 204, 1, 3, 295423) A man of prayer could never accept slavery as his lot.
('87', 204, 2, 4, 295478) If all had taken to spinning in the way he wanted it, Gandhiji said, they would have had swaraj without any further effort.
('87', 204, 2, 5, 295602) He would not have had to come up to Simla.
('87', 204, 2, 6, 295645) But society was made of all kinds of people.
('87', 204, 2, 7, 295690) Therefore he had to come in common with others for the conference to see whether it was possible through the conference [to find a] way to further the progress towards independence.
('87', 204, 3, 8, 295872) As for the yarn to be given in exchange for khadi it should be either spun by the individual concerned or by members of his family.
('87', 204, 3, 9, 296004) The farthest the A. I. S. A. could go was to let them take yarn spun by their servants whom they should treat as members of the family.
('87', 204, 3, 10, 296140) Yarn bought from the black market could not serve the purpose in view.
('87', 204, 3, 11, 296211) Also, if Bhandars began to sell yarn to prospective purchasers of khadi, that would defeat the very purpose for which the new rule was being enforced.

('87', 204, 5, 14, 296409) [After July 2, 1945] 1
('87', 204, 6, 15, 296432) DEAR LORD SAMUEL 2, I have your letter of 2nd July.
('87', 204, 6, 16, 296484) I am sorry that you are still unconvinced.
('87', 204, 6, 17, 296527) The ground of your objections seems to be that whilst the Congress may sincerely wish to embrace all parties and is trying to do so, it has not yet been able to achieve it and that its ultimate achievement is problematical, while the taking of the delivery is to be immediate and certain.
('87', 204, 6, 18, 296816) This objection again overlooks the very relevant fact to which I have twice drawn your attention, namely, that the Congress through its president has invited the Government to transfer full power to the League and ask it to form a truly national government, in which it would have the loyal co operation of the Congress.
('87', 204, 6, 19, 297137) This offer was reiterated at Simla.
('87', 204, 6, 20, 297173) But I am sorry to have to say it was again turned down.
('87', 204, 6, 21, 297229) I still adhere to my statement that “there cannot be Swaraj without an understanding with the Muslims.” My contention is and has been that the presence of the third party is the greatest stumbling block in the way of this understanding.
('87', 204, 6, 22, 297466) So long as one community in the country enjoys the power of vetoing all political progress there can be no reasonable settlement.
('87', 204, 6, 23, 297596) In India this anomalous power is

('87', 205, 1, 2, 297776) assured to the League by the British Government which supererogates to itself the right of arbitrating and holding the balance of power between the various communities.
('87', 205, 1, 3, 297945) In the absence of an agreed solution, a just solution through impartial arbitration is held to be the only feasible alternative in civilized society, but in India the absence of an agreed solution is strangely held to be a justification for retention of power by an alien Government over a nation of 400 millions !
('87', 205, 1, 4, 298260) ‘Quit India’ can be the only reply to such a claim.
('87', 205, 1, 5, 298312) It seemsstrange that you should see in this cry a manifestation of totalitarian spirit instead of the anguished despair of an enslaved people to be free from totalitarian foreign rule which has in the past demonstrably sabotaged all their efforts to achieve unity in order to be free and spurned their united and unanimous demands for political advance.

('87', 229, 2, 3, 325936) July 12, 1945
('87', 229, 3, 4, 325950) Mahatma Gandhi referred to the serious inconvenience experienced by his host due to unruly crowds.
('87', 229, 3, 5, 326049) Some of them had invaded the house opposite to ‘Manor Ville’, which belonged to Rajkumari Amrit Kaur’s brother and had smashed flower pots and damaged the railing of the verandah.
('87', 229, 3, 6, 326229) When checked by the Rani Saheba they had been rude to her.
('87', 229, 3, 7, 326288) All this hurt him deeply.
('87', 229, 3, 8, 326314) He would have liked to run away.
('87', 229, 3, 9, 326347) But after all, wherever he went the crowds would go with him.
('87', 229, 3, 10, 326409) He could not run away from them.
('87', 229, 3, 11, 326442) He was their servant and he lived to serve them.
('87', 229, 4, 12, 326491) Some came to the prayers, Gandhiji said, simply to have his darshan.
('87', 229, 4, 13, 326560) He had told them often enough that he was not a mahatma.
('87', 229, 4, 14, 326617) He was just one of them, an ordinary human being.
('87', 229, 4, 15, 326667) He must, however, confess that he called the name of God with every breath of his life and in everything that he did he proceeded with God as hiswitness.
('87', 229, 4, 16, 326821) But that should not make him a mahatma.
('87', 229, 4, 17, 326861) Every human being should act as he claimed he did.
('87', 229, 4, 18, 326912) That was what distinguished man from beast.
('87', 229, 4, 19, 326956) Those who came to the prayers should at least have decent manners.
('87', 229, 4, 20, 327023) Even the soldiers in arms observed discipline and behaved in an orderly fashion.
('87', 229, 4, 21, 327104) These who came to pray should have better manners, not worse.
('87', 229, 4, 22, 327166) The object of coming to prayers was to praise God and for doing that, purity of thought was a necessary pre requisite.
('87', 229, 4, 23, 327285) If they could not control their minds, they should pray to God that he should enable them to have pure thoughts at least during prayers.
('87', 229, 4, 24, 327422) Gradually and with practice they would be able to control them at all times.

('87', 231, 8, 15, 328806) You have not given enough thought to the matter.
('87', 231, 8, 16, 328855) If khadi workers are pure, khadi work will not become static.
('87', 231, 8, 17, 328917) Today we have very little khadi.
('87', 231, 8, 18, 328950) Make a thorough study of the theory and practice of khadi.

('87', 232, 3, 4, 329323) Prayer is even more essential for the well being of the soul than is food for the maintenance of the body.
('87', 232, 3, 5, 329430) It becomes necessary to give up food on occasions in order to benefit the body.
('87', 232, 3, 6, 329510) But prayer may never be abandoned.
('87', 232, 3, 7, 329545) If we provide food for the body which is perishable, then, surely, it is our primary duty to provide food for the soul which is imperishable and such sustenance is found in prayer.
('87', 232, 3, 8, 329726) The real meaning of prayer is devoted worship.
('87', 232, 4, 9, 329773) S. N. CHATTOPADHYAYA: Why do you never look at your face in a looking glass ?
('87', 232, 5, 10, 329851) GANDHIJI: Since everyone who meets me sees my face, what need is there for me to employ a mirror?
('87', 232, 6, 11, 329949) Why do you not use a thick mattress?
('87', 232, 6, 12, 329986) I do all I can to merge myself into the poor millions of India.
('87', 232, 7, 13, 330050) Why do you always travel third class on the railway?
('87', 232, 7, 14, 330103) The answer to this is embodied in the above.
('87', 232, 8, 15, 330148) Why not take salt and spices with your food?
('87', 232, 8, 16, 330193) Why should I take anything which is not essential for my bodily needs?

('87', 233, 8, 10, 330979) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your note of the 14th instant.
('87', 233, 8, 11, 331039) It gladdens me to think that you have appreciated my effort to advance the common cause.
('87', 233, 8, 12, 331128) As you perhaps know, I have arranged to leave here tomorrow.
('87', 233, 8, 13, 331189) A special from Kalka will carry me to Wardha by the kind courtesy of the authorities concerned.
('87', 233, 8, 14, 331285) It grieves me to think that the conference which began so happily and so hopefully should have ended in apparent failure—due exactly, as it would seem, to the same cause as before.
('87', 233, 8, 15, 331466) This time you have taken the blame on your own shoulders.
('87', 233, 8, 16, 331524) 1 But the world will think otherwise.
('87', 233, 8, 17, 331562) India certainly does.
('87', 233, 8, 18, 331584) I must not hide from you the suspicion that the deeper cause is perhaps the reluctance of the official world to part with power, which the passing of the virtual control into the hands of their erstwhile prisoners would have meant.
('87', 233, 8, 19, 331816) Be that as it may, what a pity that the moral height which the British, if not even the Allied Powers, would have occupied by the suc cess of the conference cannot be theirs, at any rate, for the time being.
('87', 233, 8, 20, 332024) I must not close this without a reminder about the Bihar case.
('87', 233, 8, 21, 332087) Your passing remark that it was one of ordinary dacoity, calling for the heavy hand of law, disturbed me.

('87', 234, 1, 2, 332344) dacoity.
('87', 234, 1, 3, 332353) The young man who is under sentence of death is no professional dacoit.
('87', 234, 1, 4, 332425) He is a misled Congressman under twenty five years (I think.) with a young wife of twenty years.
('87', 234, 1, 5, 332522) I do hope that all such death sentences will be commuted to life sentences.
('87', 234, 1, 6, 332598) It seems tobe the least demand of humanity, if not also of high politics.

('87', 234, 7, 19, 333420) The sentence of death .
('87', 234, 7, 20, 333444) was confirmed by the High Court .
('87', 234, 7, 21, 333478) Privy Council has rejected an application for special appeal.
('87', 234, 7, 22, 333540) I cannot find anything.
('87', 234, 7, 23, 333564) to suggest that Mahendra Chowdhury is a political offender .
('87', 234, 7, 24, 333625) I have decided that the law must take its course.” 2 Gandhiji was observing silence.

('87', 235, 2, 4, 333831) I am writing this after the morning prayer.
('87', 235, 2, 5, 333875) Address your reply at Sevagram.
('87', 235, 2, 6, 333907) You have remained as crazy after becoming a communist and a mother as you were as a child.
('87', 235, 2, 7, 333998) Which Ashram has boycotted you?
('87', 235, 2, 8, 334030) Where is the Ashram?
('87', 235, 2, 9, 334051) Who has boycotted you?
('87', 235, 2, 10, 334074) Many communists have stayed with me.
('87', 235, 2, 11, 334111) In the same way you also can stay.
('87', 235, 2, 12, 334146) You know that Jayanti 1 had stayed with me.
('87', 235, 2, 13, 334190) You should know that I have received many complaints, but I have not acted on any of them.
('87', 235, 2, 14, 334281) I am in correspondence with the Secr etary 2. He had asked me for my permission to publish the letters and I have granted it.
('87', 235, 2, 15, 334407) Whether he has published them or not I do not know.
('87', 235, 2, 16, 334459) The Working Committee 3 has taken no step.
('87', 235, 2, 17, 334502) There has been no time to consider the matter.
('87', 235, 2, 18, 334549) If Jawaharlalji goes against them, all the communists will have to sit up and think.
('87', 235, 2, 19, 334634) For he has a soft corner for the Party but he will not tolerate anything unworthy.
('87', 235, 2, 20, 334717) I myself have not been able to come to a final decision.
('87', 235, 2, 21, 334774) I have received quite a few complaints.
('87', 235, 2, 22, 334814) I have sent them to the Head office.
('87', 235, 2, 23, 334851) You have written your letter without thinking.
('87', 235, 2, 24, 334898) If you calm down and think before writing, you can help the communist cause.
('87', 235, 2, 25, 334975) You must learn to distinguish between communism and commu nists.
('87', 235, 2, 26, 335040) Besides, Marx stands for one thing, Lenin for another and Stalin for a third.
('87', 235, 2, 27, 335118) The followers of the last are again divided into two groups.
('87', 235, 2, 28, 335179) Gandhi is one thing, Gandhism is another and Gandhi ites are a third thing.
('87', 235, 2, 29, 335255) There are always, and will remain, such differences.
('87', 235, 2, 30, 335308) Immature people may identify themselves with one or the other group.

('87', 237, 1, 2, 337509) 412. “A THOUGHT THE DAY” 1
('87', 237, 2, 3, 337536) April 25, 1945 A man does not become a satyagrahi by styling himself as such.
('87', 237, 2, 4, 337614) The observance of pure truth alone makes him a satyagrahi.
('87', 237, 2, 5, 337673) April 26, 1945 Is only that unclean which appears to the eye as unclean?
('87', 237, 2, 6, 337746) If there is even a little dirt on what is white, we feel annoyed; but the black may have any amount of dirt on it and we care not at all!
('87', 237, 2, 7, 337884) April 27, 1945 We consider the black impure and the white pure.
('87', 237, 2, 8, 337948) But black, in its natural setting, is as much a virtue; as white, out of place, is a vice.
('87', 237, 2, 9, 338039) April 28, 1945 How strange that one who claims not to fear death fears it the most, and seeks every means to avoid it!
('87', 237, 2, 10, 338158) April 29, 1945 A son’s obeisance to his parents is undoubtedly a form of prayer.
('87', 237, 2, 11, 338239) What homage, then, must we pay to Him who is the Eternal Father of us all?
('87', 237, 2, 12, 338314) Prayer may not be interpreted here in a narrow sense.
('87', 237, 2, 13, 338368) April 30, 1945 “A Thought for Today,’, published in today’s The Times of India, appealed to me.
('87', 237, 2, 14, 338464) Its purport is: “Believe in Truth, think Truth and live Truth.
('87', 237, 2, 15, 338527) Howsoever triumphant untruth may seem to be, it can never prevail against Truth.”
('87', 237, 3, 16, 338609) 1 Originally written in Hindi, these ‘thoughts, were translated and published under this title by Anand T. Hingorani, who explains in the Preface that after the death of his wife, Vidya, on July 20, 1943, during his eight week stay in Sevagram from September 30, 1944, Gandhiji would greet him “every morning, after the prayer .
('87', 237, 3, 17, 338938) speak words of sympathy and solace, and .
('87', 237, 3, 18, 338980) write down something .
('87', 237, 3, 19, 339003) to meditate upon.
('87', 237, 3, 20, 339021) From October 13, 1944, onwards he wrote continuously for a fortnight, and then off and on.
('87', 237, 3, 21, 339112) .” Before leaving Sevagram for nature cure treatment at Bhimavaram, Hingorani had requested Gandhiji to write something for him daily, which Gandhiji began to do from November 20, 1944, vide In June 1946, when Hingorani sought Gandhiji’s permission to publish the ‘thoughts, in a book form, Gandhiji remarked: “What is there about them that you are so keen on publishing them?
('87', 237, 3, 22, 339489) If, however, you wish to publish them, do so after my death.
('87', 237, 3, 23, 339550) Such writings are generally never published during the lifetime of their authors.
('87', 237, 3, 24, 339632) Who knows, I may not be able to live up to what I have written !
('87', 237, 3, 25, 339697) But if I live up to it till the last breath of my life, then alone will it be worthwhile to publish these thoughts.” Gandhiji, however, discontinued the practice by the end of 1946, as he put it, “for the sake of my Noakhali mission, I renounced practically everything .
('87', 237, 3, 26, 339968) gave up the Ashram, all my companions and even writing for the Harijan.

('87', 238, 1, 2, 340082) May 1, 1945 Where there is hypocrisy, even if there is something good along with it, do not go there even for the sake of picking up that good only.
('87', 238, 1, 3, 340231) If you do, it could be co operation with evil which must not be offered: May 2, 1945 Just as we throw away milk if there is poison in it, so must we reject any good which has got the poison of hypocrisy mixed with it.
('87', 238, 1, 4, 340449) May 3, 1945 Says Confucius: “In a well ordered State, progress is not measured in terms of wealth.
('87', 238, 1, 5, 340548) The purity of the People and their leaders alone constitutes the true wealth of the nation.” May 4, 1945 Minds are of two kinds: one kind elevates, the other debases.
('87', 238, 1, 6, 340715) Let us constantly reflect over this and learn to distinguish one from the other.
('87', 238, 1, 7, 340796) May 5, 1945 Just as only others can see a man’s back while he himself cannot, we too cannot see our own errors.
('87', 238, 1, 8, 340908) May 6, 1945 Is not death, in every case, a release from too much suffering?
('87', 238, 1, 9, 340984) If so, why lament when it comes?
('87', 238, 1, 10, 341017) May 7, 1945 Life is likened to a rose; because life, too, is full of thorns.
('87', 238, 1, 11, 341094) May 8, 1945 Verily, there should be only one fear—the fear of doing something mean or untrue.
('87', 238, 1, 12, 341188) May 9, 1945 Slipshod work is like half baked bread, fit only to be thrown away.
('87', 238, 1, 13, 341268) May 10, 1945 Why is it that man is afraid of speaking and practising truth, not untruth?
('87', 238, 1, 14, 341357) May 11, 1945 There is an English saying, which is true, that “cowards die many times before their death”.
('87', 238, 1, 15, 341463) As I have often said, death really means deliverance from pain and suffering.
('87', 238, 1, 16, 341541) Fear serves only to accentuate suffering and makes one’s condition pitiable.
('87', 239, 0, 1, 341618) 240 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('87', 239, 1, 2, 341660) May 12, 1945 By whatever name God be called, if there be godly attributes, we must surely bow to Him.
('87', 239, 1, 3, 341762) May 13, 1945 Then, what should God be like?
('87', 239, 1, 4, 341806) Passionless and Formless, He should be a repository of all attributes and yet be wholly without attributes.
('87', 239, 1, 5, 341914) Why should God then be of masculine gender?
('87', 239, 1, 6, 341958) This is purely a question of grammar.
('87', 239, 1, 7, 341996) The God of our conception, being formless, is neither male nor female.
('87', 239, 1, 8, 342067) May 14, 1945 The breach of one rule inevitably leads to the breach of other rules.
('87', 239, 1, 9, 342150) May 15, 1945 To rejoice in happiness is to invite misery.
('87', 239, 1, 10, 342208) Real happiness springs from sorrow and suffering.
('87', 239, 1, 11, 342258) May 16, 1945 Not contrived but genuine laughter is true eloquence, and more effective than speech.
('87', 239, 1, 12, 342357) May 17, 1945 The contentment that accrues to man as a result of leading a regular life, promotes his health and longevity.
('87', 239, 1, 13, 342480) May 18, 1945 Pride devours man completely.
('87', 239, 1, 14, 342523) The truth of this can be realized by everyone every moment.
('87', 239, 1, 15, 342583) May 19, 1945 On the other hand, modesty and humility nourish man and make for his growth.
('87', 239, 1, 16, 342673) May 20, 1945 Every minute that runs to waste is irrecoverable.
('87', 239, 1, 17, 342736) Yet, knowing this, how much time we waste!
('87', 239, 1, 18, 342779) May 21, 1945 A needless word is also a violation of truth.
('87', 239, 1, 19, 342838) That is why the practice of truth becomes easier by observing silence.
('87', 239, 1, 20, 342909) May 22, 1945 Like a ship without direction or destination, labour without an ideal is fruitless.
('87', 239, 1, 21, 343006) May 23, 1945 The power by which a railway train moves, an aeroplane flies and man lives, is Divine Power, by whatsoever name one may call it.
('87', 240, 0, 1, 343148) VOL. 87: 29 MAY, 1945 29 AUGUST, 1945 241
('87', 240, 1, 2, 343190) The train is not moved by the steam engine; the aeroplane is not flown by the motor; nor does man live by the mere mechanical functioning of his heart.
('87', 240, 1, 3, 343342) May 24, 1945 “Sweet are the fruits of equanimity”—the truth of this is experienced every moment.
('87', 240, 1, 4, 343439) May 25, 1945 There is a vast difference between obstinacy and steadfastness.
('87', 240, 1, 5, 343516) To seek to foist one’s view on others is obstinacy; whereas steadfastness is that whereby we voluntarily impose something on ourselves and which results in bringing others round to the acceptance of our view of their own free will.
('87', 240, 1, 6, 343748) May 26, 1945 What should a man do when there is much work and little time to do it in?
('87', 240, 1, 7, 343835) He should have patience, do what he believes is most useful and leave the rest to God.
('87', 240, 1, 8, 343922) If God grants life, the arrear can be taken up some other day.
('87', 240, 1, 9, 343985) May 27, 1945 I took off my spectacles to wash my face.
('87', 240, 1, 10, 344040) I had intended to pick them up later, but forgot to do so.
('87', 240, 1, 11, 344099) Because something else engrossed my attention and so I became negligent.
('87', 240, 1, 12, 344172) This is called disorganization which is a dangerous thing.
('87', 240, 1, 13, 344231) May 28, 1945 A man is ashamed when he does something wrong.
('87', 240, 1, 14, 344291) But when he does something good, he wishes to let it be known.
('87', 240, 1, 15, 344354) May 29, 1945 Envy devours him who harbours it.
('87', 240, 1, 16, 344401) He who is the object of envy remains unaffected, perhaps even unaware of it.
('87', 240, 1, 17, 344478) May 30, 1945 The opposite of envy is generosity.
('87', 240, 1, 18, 344527) Generosity does not allow us to be envious of anyone.
('87', 240, 1, 19, 344581) On the contrary, if we find virtue in anyone, we appreciate it and even profit by it.
('87', 240, 1, 20, 344667) May 31, 1945 Every moment I observe how man deceives himself.
('87', 240, 1, 21, 344729) June 1, 1945 He who wants to please all, will please none.
('87', 240, 1, 22, 344788) June 2, 1945 It is God that we have to please.
('87', 240, 1, 23, 344835) If we praise, we should praise Him only.
('87', 240, 1, 24, 344876) Then shall we become free of all worry and botheration.
('87', 241, 0, 1, 344932) 242 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('87', 241, 1, 2, 344974) June 3, 1945 How shall we please God, how praise Him?
('87', 241, 1, 3, 345028) By serving His creature—man.
('87', 241, 1, 4, 345057) June 4, 1945 When, as a matter of habit, a man knows not what he speaks, it is high time that he got rid of that habit either by muffling his mouth or even by sealing his lips.
('87', 241, 1, 5, 345234) Jane 5, 1945 Desire is of various kinds—good, bad and feasible.
('87', 241, 1, 6, 345298) The mind should harbour only that which is good and possible of realiza tion.
('87', 241, 1, 7, 345376) June 6, 1945 Different people interpret the Shastras (religious scriptures) differently.
('87', 241, 1, 8, 345465) The right course is to follow in practice that interpretation which appeals to us as basically sound even if it can be proved to be grammatically unsound, provided, however, that our interpretation is not opposed to morality and that it makes for self restraint.
('87', 241, 1, 9, 345728) June 7, 1945 An untruthful person leaves many a loophole for himself.
('87', 241, 1, 10, 345798) And when he escapes through one or the other, he thinks he is very clever!
('87', 241, 1, 11, 345873) In fact, by doing so, he only digs pitfalls for himself.
('87', 241, 1, 12, 345930) June 8, 1945 A man of Truth, on the other hand, plugs all loopholes; or rath er for him, it may be said, there is neither a wall nor any holes.
('87', 241, 1, 13, 346074) He can walk even blindfold on the right path and never does he fall into a pit.
('87', 241, 1, 14, 346154) June 9, 1945 Non attachment is difficult of attainment, as some say.
('87', 241, 1, 15, 346223) So it is.
('87', 241, 1, 16, 346233) But are not the things we need always difficult to obtain?
('87', 241, 1, 17, 346292) It is only when we put in a sustained and determined effort that what is difficult becomes easy.
('87', 241, 1, 18, 346389) June 10, 1945 Drops make the ocean, the reason being that there is complete cohesion and co operation among the drops.
('87', 241, 1, 19, 346508) The same law applies to human beings.
('87', 241, 1, 20, 346546) June 11, 1945 To conceal ignorance is to increase it.
('87', 241, 1, 21, 346600) An honest confession of it, however, gives ground for the hope that it will diminish.
('87', 241, 1, 22, 346686) June 12, 1945 What is learnt by rote is of as little value as the parrot’s recitation of Ramanama.
('87', 242, 0, 1, 346785) VOL. 87: 29 MAY, 1945 29 AUGUST, 1945 243
('87', 242, 1, 2, 346827) June 13, 1945 If the foregoing is correct and borne out by experience, it follows that knowledge that sinks deep, and becomes part of one’s being, is capable of transforming man, provided, however, that such knowledge is self knowledge.
('87', 242, 1, 3, 347064) June 14, 1945 If a man does anything, and regrets it afterwards, it shows that he has not done it with due deliberation but under compulsion.
('87', 242, 1, 4, 347206) June 15, 1945 Non attachment is put to real test only when there is full scope for our attachment to something.
('87', 242, 1, 5, 347318) June 16, 1945 It is man’s habit to forget his own faults and see those of others.
('87', 242, 1, 6, 347400) This naturally brings him disappointment in the end.
('87', 242, 1, 7, 347453) June 17, 1945 To have faith in God should be the easiest thing in the world, yet it appears to be the most difficult.
('87', 242, 1, 8, 347571) June 18, 1945 The root cause of most of our misunderstandings lies in distrust, and the root cause of this distrust lies most in fear.
('87', 242, 1, 9, 347706) June 19, 1945 The common saying goes that there can be no love without fear.
('87', 242, 1, 10, 347783) But that is wrong.
('87', 242, 1, 11, 347802) The fact is that where there is fear, there can be no true love.
('87', 242, 1, 12, 347867) June 20, 1945 Experience is daily growing upon me that everything is attainable through silence.
('87', 242, 1, 13, 347964) June 21, 1945 If we stopped talking about useless things and talked of things that matter in as few words as possible, much of our time as well as that of others could be saved.
('87', 242, 1, 14, 348142) June 22, 1945 It follows from the foregoing that we would be thereby adding that much time to our span of life.
('87', 242, 1, 15, 348254) June 23, 1945 The same thing when looked at from one angle makes us lose our temper, and when viewed from another makes us laugh.
('87', 242, 1, 16, 348384) Will it not be better if we neither become angry nor laugh?
('87', 243, 0, 1, 348444) 244 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('87', 243, 1, 2, 348486) June 24, 1945 Daily we have testimony of the influence exercised by one who speaks the truth and lives up to it.
('87', 243, 1, 3, 348599) Even so, we never think of following his example in word and deed.
('87', 243, 1, 4, 348666) June 25, 1945 Sacrifice which causes pain is no sacrifice at all.
('87', 243, 1, 5, 348732) True sacrifice is joy giving and uplifting.
('87', 243, 1, 6, 348776) June 26, 1945 True help can come only from God.
('87', 243, 1, 7, 348824) But God helps only through some agency.
('87', 243, 1, 8, 348864) Let no one, therefore, knowingly seek the help of a broken reed.
('87', 243, 1, 9, 348929) June 27, 1945 Guru Teg Bahadur says: “The life which causes the least possible injury is simple life.
('87', 243, 1, 10, 349031) That which causes no pain at all is pure life.” Therefore, he alone practises true religion who does nothing evil.
('87', 243, 1, 11, 349146) June 28, 1945 If someone says, “Go straight along this road”, and if a man follows the given direction, he is sure to reach his destination.
('87', 243, 1, 12, 349287) Such a road is truth.
('87', 243, 1, 13, 349309) Going along that road, a man reaches his goal in the shortest possible time.
('87', 243, 1, 14, 349386) June 29, 1945 Every minute of my life I am conscious of the presence of God.
('87', 243, 1, 15, 349463) Why, then, need I fear anyone?
('87', 243, 1, 16, 349494) June 30, 1945 A man came to me today and said: “I lose all interest in living if I do not render true service”.
('87', 243, 1, 17, 349606) July 1, 1945 Do not lose your temper if someone calls you a liar or opposes you.
('87', 243, 1, 18, 349687) If you want to say something, say it calmly.
('87', 243, 1, 19, 349732) Or, perhaps, silence would be best.
('87', 243, 1, 20, 349768) If you are really truthful, you do not become a liar simply because someone calls you so.
('87', 243, 1, 21, 349858) July 2, 1945 Untruth corrodes the soul, truth nourishes it.
('87', 243, 1, 22, 349918) July 3, 1945 There is greater pleasure in not eating than in eating.
('87', 243, 1, 23, 349987) Who has not experienced the truth of it?
('87', 243, 1, 24, 350028) July 4, 1945 Do not listen to rumour; but, if you do, do not believe it.
('87', 244, 0, 1, 350101) VOL. 87: 29 MAY, 1945 29 AUGUST, 1945 245
('87', 244, 1, 2, 350143) July 5, 1945 We must always listen to criticism of our faults and failings, never to our praises.
('87', 244, 1, 3, 350241) July 6, 1945 When ‘I’ and when ‘God’?
('87', 244, 1, 4, 350279) In determining this lies the test of wisdom.
('87', 244, 1, 5, 350324) July 7, 1945 God is one.
('87', 244, 1, 6, 350349) He is ever Changeless and Formless.
('87', 244, 1, 7, 350385) We are his mirrors.
('87', 244, 1, 8, 350405) If we are straight and pure, God is also reflected in us as such.
('87', 244, 1, 9, 350471) But if we are crooked and vile, His image suffers the same distortion.
('87', 244, 1, 10, 350542) It behoves us, therefore, always to remain clean and pure in every respect.
('87', 244, 1, 11, 350618) July 8, 1945 To find fault is one thing; to prove it is another.
('87', 244, 1, 12, 350683) July 9, 1945 He alone knows the charm of solitude who has deliberately taken to it.
('87', 244, 1, 13, 350767) July 10, 1945 He who is the dust of everybody’s feet is near to God.
('87', 244, 1, 14, 350836) July 11, 1945 Do not think, speak or write without reflecting.
('87', 244, 1, 15, 350899) Consider how much time could thereby be saved.
('87', 244, 1, 16, 350946) July 12, 1945 Just as the universe is contained in the self, so is India contained in the villages.
('87', 244, 1, 17, 351046) July 13, 1945 If India lives in the villages, then let there be but one ideal village and it can serve as a model for the whole country.
('87', 244, 1, 18, 351183) July 14, 1945 If we think of India from the point of view of the villages, most of the things that we do will appear to be useless.
('87', 244, 1, 19, 351315) July 15, 1945 Life is not for making merry.
('87', 244, 1, 20, 351359) Rather it is for the realization of the Creator and for the service of the creation.
('87', 244, 1, 21, 351444) July 16, 1945 If life is intended only for the service of humanity and for the realization of God, then it becomes our duty to keep it pure and abstemious.

('87', 245, 2, 3, 351704) AGRA, July 17, 1945 [GANDHIJI:] Study and work for the country’s freedom.
('87', 245, 2, 4, 351778) This is my message to the students of India.
('87', 245, 3, 5, 351823) Gandhiji said that he realized the despondency of the student community on the failure of the Simla Conference 2 and the danger of ill feeling that might creep in between Hindu and Muslim students.
('87', 245, 3, 6, 352021) Hopes must not be lost.
('87', 245, 4, 7, 352045) Gandhiji stressed the need of unity among students and said it was deplorable that a number of parties existed and things had reached such a stage that the police were sometimes required to intervene.
('87', 245, 4, 8, 352246) He wished that students of every creed, colour and caste worked as a united body for the common cause.
('87', 245, 4, 9, 352349) He advised the people [to refrain] from indulging in mutual recriminations.
('87', 245, 5, 10, 352425) Asked if the Simla Conference failed on the issue of one seat given to a non Leaguer, Mahatma Gandhi refuted the contention.
('87', 245, 5, 11, 352550) He said that he would publicize his views regarding this problem at the earliest opportunity.

('87', 245, 6, 13, 352675) 1 On his way to Wardha after the Simla Conference, Gandhiji addressed the crowd assembled at the Agra Cantt.

('87', 245, 6, 15, 352842) About a dozen local Communists, who had collected on the platform, were initially disallowed by the authorities but they were allowed on the assurance from them to remain peaceful.
('87', 245, 6, 16, 353023) 2 The Simla Conference was convened by the Viceroy, Lord Wavell, and was attended by leaders of the various parties, prominent among whom were Abul Kalam Azad, Bhulabhai Desai, M. A. Jinnah, Dr. Khan Saheb, Liaquat Ali Khan, Sir Henry Richardson, Rao Bahadur Shiv Raj and Master Tara Singh.
('87', 245, 6, 17, 353314) Gandhiji did not attend the Conference but he remained in Simla so as to be available for consultation.
('87', 245, 6, 18, 353418) The Conference, started on June 25, was adjourned on June 29 to enable the parties to send the lists of the names for the proposed Executive Council.
('87', 245, 6, 19, 353568) However, when it met again on July 14 Lord Wavell announced its failure.

('87', 246, 3, 4, 353735) M. N. TANDON: Failure at Simla has disappointed the people who looked to a change in the regime.
('87', 246, 4, 5, 353832) GANDHIJI: They should not be disappointed.
('87', 246, 4, 6, 353875) The Congress took a correct attitude and has vindicated its national character.
('87', 246, 5, 7, 353955) M. N. T. Mutual apportionment of blame has begun between the Congress and the League leaders and the papers.
('87', 246, 5, 8, 354064) Would this not embitter relations and dash hopes of any future settlement, thus drifting to a position of civil war and riots?
('87', 246, 6, 9, 354191) G. Mutual recriminations should not be indulged in though truth will have to be spoken.
('87', 246, 6, 10, 354279) There is a danger of the situation drifting into a civil war.
('87', 246, 6, 11, 354341) The clash at Delhi station before Maulana Azad’s compart ment is a pointer.
('87', 246, 6, 12, 354417) But the police should not be allowed to maintain order amongst us.
('87', 246, 6, 13, 354484) But if riots take place what can we do?
('87', 246, 6, 14, 354524) Riots have always been taking place.
('87', 246, 6, 15, 354561) Even in the reign of .
('87', 246, 6, 16, 354584) 3 riots and disturb ances took place.
('87', 246, 6, 17, 354622) This country is inhabited by a very large population of various conflicting ideas.
('87', 246, 7, 18, 354705) M. N. T. Civil disturbances of the older days were no comparison to those of today with their political and economic implications.
('87', 246, 7, 19, 354836) Patriots of the Congress and the League would fight instead of uniting for people’s service, with the result that the people would lose faith in the honesty and patriotism of both.
('87', 246, 7, 20, 355017) Their miseries would increase tenfold and the national movement would go to pieces.
('87', 246, 8, 21, 355101) G. Yes.
('87', 246, 8, 22, 355109) We should make efforts not to let such a situation develop.
('87', 246, 9, 23, 355169) M. N. T. Do you hope that the Congress and the League will be able to settle in the near future?
('87', 246, 9, 24, 355266) G. We should all hope so.
('87', 246, 10, 25, 355292) M. N. T. The belief of the common man is that the Conference broke over the question of a single seat due to dissensions among the leaders.
('87', 246, 11, 26, 355432) G. It is wrong to say that the Conference broke over the question

('87', 247, 1, 3, 355861) The Congress fought for a principle.
('87', 247, 2, 4, 355898) M. N. T. Even if the Congress had to nominate only Hindu Congressmen, they could very well have represented the Nationalist Muslims and safeguarded their interests.
('87', 247, 2, 5, 356063) There is no difference between Congressman and Congressman.
('87', 247, 3, 6, 356123) G. But we were seeking able men of all parties and communities.
('87', 247, 3, 7, 356187) We did not bother which party got what number of seats.
('87', 247, 4, 8, 356243) M. N. T. You had accepted the Bhulabhai Formula 1 of Congress League parity and gave a public statement 2 to that effect.
('87', 247, 4, 9, 356365) But the Congress Working Committee agreed to Hindu Muslim parity, proposed by Wavell, 3 thus raising the rock of breakdown, since Congress and League could not agree to the nomination of one by the other.
('87', 247, 4, 10, 356570) Is it a fact that the Working Committee disagreed with you and rejected the Congress League parity formula?
('87', 247, 5, 11, 356678) G. Now you are dragging me into deep water.
('87', 247, 5, 12, 356722) The truth is something like this.
('87', 247, 5, 13, 356756) I shall write about it in the near future.
('87', 247, 6, 14, 356799) M. N. T. You perhaps know that the Communists’ main slogan all through the Conference has been “transform Hindu Muslim parity into Congress League parity” and they are making efforts in the direction.
('87', 247, 7, 15, 357000) G. They should continue their efforts.
('87', 247, 8, 16, 357039) M. N. T. On what grounds did your correspondence with P. C. Joshi 4 break?
('87', 247, 9, 17, 357114) G. Who says it has broken down?
('87', 247, 10, 18, 357146) M. N. T. Has the Working Committee taken any decision regarding the Communists?
('87', 247, 11, 19, 357226) It has not taken any decision.
('87', 247, 12, 20, 357257) M. N. T. You know the ban of the U. P. Government continues on the three Communist weeklies 5 in U. P.
('87', 247, 13, 21, 357360) G. Have they not yet lifted the ban?
('87', 247, 13, 22, 357397) It is very wrong for the Government to do so.

('87', 248, 3, 8, 358390) SEVAGRAM, July 18, 1945 The public will not like to know, as I have not liked, the fact that I had to travel from Kalka to Wardha like a thief.
('87', 248, 3, 9, 358534) I could do so only by the courtesy of the authorities.
('87', 248, 3, 10, 358589) Why should I have to escape the embarrassing affection of the public?
('87', 248, 3, 11, 358659) When I travelled by the Frontier Mail from Bombay to Kalka 2, at every stopping station it was a wild demonstration.
('87', 248, 3, 12, 358776) Accidents, even fatal, were escaped by miracle.
('87', 248, 3, 13, 358824) Those who were with me in the compartment had a rough time and two wakeful nights.
('87', 248, 3, 14, 358907) Singly I might not have been able to cope with the din, noise and hustle of the crowd.
('87', 248, 3, 15, 358994) Of course this was not the first time that I had to face such wild demonstrations, nor am I unaware that other leaders have to go through such ordeals, but the fact is that each year makes me less fit for them.
('87', 248, 3, 16, 359205) My ears cannot stand the noise.
('87', 248, 3, 17, 359237) I can do no work among demonstrators and cannot make Harijan collections in such circumstances.
('87', 248, 3, 18, 359333) What is most painful is the fact that this wildness is no prelude to swaraj, it is no sign of non violence.
('87', 248, 3, 19, 359441) Crowds there should be to greet the leaders, but they should be peaceful, dignified and completely disciplined.
('87', 248, 3, 20, 359553) I have seen ordinary soldiers in thousands observing perfect silence whether on the march or at rest.
('87', 248, 3, 21, 359655) Our crowds, if they are non violent soldiers of swaraj, should be more disciplined than ordinary soldiers.
('87', 248, 3, 22, 359762) Will leaders of volunteers learn a lesson from my train journey from Kalka to Wardha and ensure perfectly peaceful demonstrations at stations and elsewhere in all circumstances and not only or especially for me?

('87', 253, 8, 15, 366547) I have great faith in Dr. Dinshaw, and therefore I am not worrying about you.
('87', 253, 8, 16, 366625) You could not be in a better place.
('87', 253, 8, 17, 366661) I can see from your letters themselves that both of yougirls will learn something there.
('87', 253, 8, 18, 366750) You must return only after you have built up radiant health.
('87', 253, 8, 19, 366811) Trust the doctor implicitly and do whatever he tells you to do.

('87', 254, 3, 6, 367395) Then remain Vanudi.
('87', 254, 3, 7, 367415) If you have any silliness in you, leave it there.
('87', 254, 3, 8, 367465) As for the extra fat, you have gone there to shed it, and also to improve the ear.

('87', 254, 8, 19, 367955) I felt inclined to write today after hearing the account given by Kanaiyo 2. I had left him in Bombay with high hopes.
('87', 254, 8, 20, 368074) But they have not been fulfilled.
('87', 254, 8, 21, 368108) Maybe, that also is to the good.
('87', 254, 8, 22, 368141) On top of that, he got boils on the hand.
('87', 254, 8, 23, 368183) How he got them one cannot tell.
('87', 254, 8, 24, 368216) It is hoped they will subside in about eight days’ time.
('87', 254, 8, 25, 368273) After that he intends to go there.
('87', 254, 8, 26, 368308) It is necessary to think now how he should be fixed up.
('87', 254, 8, 27, 368364) He has considerable ability.
('87', 254, 8, 28, 368393) We have to consider which of his gifts to employ and on what tasks.
('87', 254, 8, 29, 368461) Personally I feel that it would be the most natural thing for him to remain with me and get trained.
('87', 254, 8, 30, 368562) But I would attach more importance to your view, for at present my mind is occupied with the work lying before me and, therefore, I am not able to concentrate it on problems of individuals.
('87', 254, 8, 31, 368752) If something occurs to me on the spur of the moment,

('87', 260, 3, 5, 376019) They have all been duly answered.
('87', 260, 3, 6, 376053) Bear in mind that anyone who spins will have to see to all the previous processes connected with cotton.
('87', 260, 3, 7, 376158) Without it the work will be incomplete.
('87', 260, 3, 8, 376198) Among these the process of carding works wonders.

('87', 260, 7, 21, 376832) If Dr. Gilder is not using Prabhavati’s 4 spinning wheel, bring it back.
('87', 260, 7, 22, 376905) Buy him a new one if he is using it, or we can send one from here.
('87', 260, 7, 23, 376972) Prabhavati’s spinning wheel is specially meant for me and so I want it back if possible.

('87', 266, 8, 12, 384824) BHAI SHYAMLAL 2, There are two ways of serving the Harijans.
('87', 266, 8, 13, 384885) First, by raising them through education, etc., and secondly by rooting out untouch ability from among the caste Hindus.
('87', 266, 8, 14, 385006) The first course always bears fruit and it is desirable to pursue it however little one can.
('87', 266, 8, 15, 385099) Simple ‘Eradication of Untouchability’ does not serve our purpose.
('87', 266, 8, 16, 385166) There fore, ‘Harijan Sevak Sangh’ is a more appropriate expression.
('87', 266, 8, 17, 385234) It is true that so far very little work has been done among the savarnas.
('87', 266, 8, 18, 385308) The reasons are obvious.
('87', 266, 8, 19, 385333) We lack self sacrifice.
('87', 266, 8, 20, 385357) Everyone, to some extent, can do the work of spreading education.
('87', 266, 8, 21, 385423) But everyone cannot work among the savarnas for the removal of Untouchability.
('87', 266, 8, 22, 385502) Untouchability cannot be removed by delivering speeches.
('87', 266, 8, 23, 385559) It will be removed only by the power of our self sacrifice.
('87', 266, 8, 24, 385619) In such self sacrifice, fasting has an important place.
('87', 266, 8, 25, 385675) The fasts should be backed by discretion.
('87', 266, 8, 26, 385717) Something could be done if competent Shastris is sue public statements.
('87', 266, 8, 27, 385789) What Barveji 3 says is not right.
('87', 266, 8, 28, 385823) There can be no separate village for Harijans because they are an integral part of society and yet outside it.
('87', 266, 8, 29, 385934) They need wells, schools, etc., and if they are properly built and

('87', 267, 1, 3, 386316) Abolition of untouchability has politi cal implications but it must be pursued with a purely religious motive.
('87', 267, 1, 4, 386427) It is a need of Hinduism.
('87', 267, 1, 5, 386453) The answers to your more important ques tions are as follows: 1. Castes must go if we want to root out untouchability.
('87', 267, 1, 6, 386572) Read my preface to Varnavyavastha 1. 2. I feel that if it becomes necessary we should continue special schools, wells, and so on.
('87', 267, 1, 7, 386702) 3. Propaganda among the savarna Hindus is necessary.
('87', 267, 1, 8, 386755) I have mentioned its limitations above.
('87', 267, 1, 9, 386795) 4. If there is a conflict with the savarnas for securing the rights of Harijans, we must put up with it but secure them the rights.
('87', 267, 1, 10, 386927) 5. The suggestion is good, but discretion will be necessary in [implementing] it.
('87', 267, 1, 11, 387009) 6. I consider the movement for temple entry as necessary.
('87', 267, 1, 12, 387067) 7. I do not know how far it is possible to have a meeting of Hindu leaders.
('87', 267, 1, 13, 387143) But there should be such a meeting.
('87', 267, 1, 14, 387179) 8. The question of separate wells has already been dealt with.

('87', 267, 4, 20, 387422) It is also uncertain where I shall be when you come.
('87', 267, 4, 21, 387475) it is only physical labour the whole day.

('87', 268, 8, 17, 388349) Why, then, should you grieve?
('87', 268, 8, 18, 388379) But this is mere philosophy.
('87', 268, 8, 19, 388408) Experience of the world tells us that no one goes mad over the death of his children.
('87', 268, 8, 20, 388494) You should, therefore, feel ashamed of yourself over your excessive grieving and shower love on Nalini.

('87', 275, 3, 5, 396377) I then gave it to Kishorelalbhai.
('87', 275, 3, 6, 396411) You probably know that he is an independent thinker.

('87', 275, 3, 9, 396583) The time has now come when the same love will separate me from you.
('87', 275, 3, 10, 396651) I have not been able to explain myself.
('87', 275, 3, 11, 396691) Kindly place this letter before the Standing Committee of the Sammelan 2. I feel that the Sammelan has not accepted my definition of Hindi.
('87', 275, 3, 12, 396831) And now my ideas are moving further still in that direction.
('87', 275, 3, 13, 396892) My definition of Rashtrabhasha includes a knowledge of Hindi and Urdu and both the Nagari and Persian scripts.
('87', 275, 3, 14, 397003) Only thus can a fusion of Hindi and Urdu come about, if it will.
('87', 275, 3, 15, 397068) I am afraid this suggestion of mine may not be welcome to the Sammelan.
('87', 275, 3, 16, 397140) I therefore request that my resignation be accepted.

('87', 276, 3, 4, 398085) DEAR FRIEND, I have just heard from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel that several thousand Indian soldiers who had joined Subhas Babu 1 in Burma or elsewhere and who were captured during the recent anti Japanese operations have been locked up in the Delhi Fort and the ring leaders (so called) have been shot under the decree of a court martial.
('87', 276, 3, 5, 398423) I am inclined to think that this is a bazaar rumour.
('87', 276, 3, 6, 398476) Nevertheless, I suggest that the public may be taken into confidence as to the true situationand that, if there is any truth about the lock up and trial, legal assistance of their choice may be given to those who may be tried.

('87', 277, 8, 19, 400601) We here cannot have the freedom that they enjoy.
('87', 277, 8, 20, 400650) But we must apply the controls that they do.

('87', 277, 8, 22, 400746) It will be published shortly.
('87', 277, 8, 23, 400776) Just now you should reduce the quantity of milk as much as you conven iently can.
('87', 277, 8, 24, 400858) The final decision should be postponed till after Sushila behn’s arrival.
('87', 277, 8, 25, 400932) I should like to do without ghee altogether, but that does not seem desirable for vegetarians.
('87', 277, 8, 26, 401027) Experience will be a better guide in this matter.
('87', 277, 8, 27, 401077) Pulses cannot replace milk, but doctors believe that they are necessary in themselves.

('87', 278, 1, 4, 401528) The same about spices.
('87', 278, 1, 5, 401551) Those who are under the Ashram vows cannot consume them for the pleasure of the palate, but if they are necessary for aiding digestion they may be used.
('87', 278, 1, 6, 401704) It should be remem bered that there are very few in the Ashram who have taken the vows.
('87', 278, 1, 7, 401792) I see no great trouble in having two separate cuisines—one with spices, the other without.
('87', 278, 1, 8, 401883) We cannot compel anybody to observe the vow of controlling the palate, or any vow.
('87', 278, 1, 9, 401966) While considering this matter, we should remember that though milk, ghee and fruit are consumed in greater quantity in the Ashram, illness persists.
('87', 278, 1, 10, 402115) We must investigate the cause of this.

('87', 282, 1, 2, 407245) 483. INTERVIEW TO “THE HINDU”
('87', 282, 2, 3, 407275) WARDHAGANJ, July 28, 1945
('87', 282, 3, 4, 407301) QUESTION: According to Dr. Pattabhi, the Desai Liaqat Formula contemplated formation of a new government first, to be followed by the release of the members of the Congress Working Committee.
('87', 282, 3, 5, 407493) This aspect of the Formula had been interpreted by some people as “bypassing the Congress” and by some others as “stabbing the Congress in the back”.
('87', 282, 4, 6, 407643) You have stated in your statement issued from Panchgani that you blessed the Formula as you thought it provided a basis for communal settlement.
('87', 282, 4, 7, 407788) It is generally believed that you were consulted at every stage of the agreement.
('87', 282, 4, 8, 407870) Is theinterpretation put on the agreement that it bypassed the Congress correct?
('87', 282, 5, 9, 407951) ANSWER: I consider the question has been addressed to a wrong person.
('87', 282, 5, 10, 408021) Parties to the Formula are the best persons to say what it meant.
('87', 282, 5, 11, 408087) Then what you put into Dr. Pattabhi’s mouth, he may repudiate.
('87', 282, 5, 12, 408150) I, therefore, suggest to all reporters at all times, but most specially at this time, to be precise and accurate in what they say.
('87', 282, 5, 13, 408281) There never was the slightest intention on the part of Advocate Bhulabhai Desai, on whose behalf alone I can speak, “of stabbing the Congress in the back” or making an attempt to “bypass” the Con gress.
('87', 282, 5, 14, 408484) He, himself made politically by the Congress, could never be guilty of any such intention, and, for me, I should be committing suicide if I could be a party to any such attempt.
('87', 282, 5, 15, 408662) I can say this much for Advocate Bhulabhai Desai that the only intention he had was that of honourably resolving the deadlock and thereby serving the Congress.
('87', 282, 5, 16, 408822) It would be wrong to say that I was consulted “at every stage” but it would be strictly correct to say that Advocate Bhulabhai Desai saw me more than once about the ‘Pact’.
('87', 282, 6, 17, 408995) Asked whether the release of the members of the Working Committee formed part of the agreement, whether it was agreed between the parties that the Muslim League alone should nominate the Muslim members of the new government and whether in view of so many statements and counter statements on the subject it would not be desirable to release the Formula for publication, Gandhiji said: I think, in the foregoing, I have said as much as I could, consis tently with the fact that the ‘Pact’ has not seen the light of day.
('87', 282, 6, 18, 409514) I wish that the parties had agreed to release it for publication.

('87', 283, 3, 4, 409685) MY DEAR SUDHIR, I have your good letter.
('87', 283, 3, 5, 409726) A man is sincere in the sense that he is not knowingly dishonest.
('87', 283, 3, 6, 409792) But if he makes up his mind hastily and will not deign to take the trouble to study accurately facts of each case, he is in fact untruthful without knowing that he is so.
('87', 283, 3, 7, 409963) Such is the case with perhaps millions of Hindus.
('87', 283, 3, 8, 410013) They sincerely believe that untouchability is a part of the divine plan.
('87', 283, 3, 9, 410086) But they hug a provable untruth.
('87', 283, 3, 10, 410119) Of course I will see Mr. Casey1 first, if I succeed in coming to Bengal which I want to do as early as the rains permit.
('87', 283, 3, 11, 410240) I have the pamphlets.

('87', 284, 7, 19, 411472) I had only to see the land pertaining to the Muslim school and to Tata.
('87', 284, 7, 20, 411544) As I understood it there was nothing for me to do in that connection.
('87', 284, 7, 21, 411614) And what can I do?
('87', 284, 7, 22, 411633) I believe that the land is not of any use to the village.
('87', 284, 7, 23, 411691) The sanatorium can be built there; that is to say we can use that land instead of the one at Simhagad.
('87', 284, 7, 24, 411794) But that apart, write to me your views.
('87', 284, 7, 25, 411834) Preston might perhaps prove expensive.

('87', 285, 4, 7, 412380) All I want to say is that the 12th Chapter (of the Gita ) is not as easy to understand and to practise as you say.
('87', 285, 4, 8, 412495) We can make anything simple and easy by distortion.
('87', 285, 4, 9, 412547) Here it seems to say the opposite of what is said elsewhere.

('87', 290, 3, 5, 418630) Better see Viceregal Secretary about Mahendra.” The new Government 1 cannot interfere with the Viceroy’s decision all of a sudden but there is some hope from Jenkins.
('87', 290, 3, 6, 418797) Did our people not send any appeal to London?
('87', 290, 3, 7, 418843) Is the person not yet hanged?
('87', 290, 3, 8, 418873) If he is alive whatever you have to do in that respect do it here.
('87', 290, 3, 9, 418940) To send deputation to London is futile.

('87', 290, 7, 16, 419141) I shall send you by book post what I can lay hands upon Sardar is none too well.
('87', 290, 7, 17, 419222) Probably he will have first to have nature cure and then, if necessary, operation.
('87', 290, 7, 18, 419305) If he goes to Poona, I shall have to go there.

('87', 291, 8, 21, 421044) I will write to Kanjibhai 1. The rule that people should work only in their own locality is very harsh.
('87', 291, 8, 22, 421148) Does it show our poverty?
('87', 291, 8, 23, 421174) We shall think about the draft when you have to resign.

('87', 291, 8, 25, 421310) It would be better if you do not ask for any official letter to be sent there.

('87', 295, 2, 3, 425873) July 1945 Sjt.
('87', 295, 2, 4, 425888) Bharatan Kumarappa writes to me from his tours: People are asking what has Gandhiji done.
('87', 295, 2, 5, 425978) He will kill khadi by insisting on yarn being given in exchange for it.
('87', 295, 2, 6, 426050) What are we, who because of his teachings have vowed to put on only khadi, to do?
('87', 295, 2, 7, 426132) We do not know how to spin neither do we want to learn it.
('87', 295, 2, 8, 426191) Are we to go without khadi?
('87', 295, 2, 9, 426219) This rule regarding yarn only shows Gandhiji’s obduracy.
('87', 295, 2, 10, 426276) Bharatan Kumarappa’s letter is in English.
('87', 295, 2, 11, 426319) I have given its substance here.
('87', 295, 2, 12, 426352) People will not find any obduracy in my demand if only they understood that non violent swaraj depends on every drawing out of the yarn.
('87', 295, 2, 13, 426489) On the contrary they will then find absorbing interest in it.
('87', 295, 2, 14, 426551) Those who see only obduracy in it do not know how non violence works.
('87', 295, 2, 15, 426621) Since my return to India I have been crying myself hoarse that if we want to attain independence through non violence spinning should be an essential part of our activity.
('87', 295, 2, 16, 426793) The late Maulana Mohamed Ali used to say that the charkha was our rifle and the spindles of yarn our bullets; we shall attain swaraj only through.
('87', 295, 2, 17, 426940) these bullets.
('87', 295, 2, 18, 426955) This is as true today as when it was said.
('87', 295, 2, 19, 426998) My experience tells me that if khadi is to become universal, both in cities and in villages, it should be made available only in exchange of yarn.
('87', 295, 2, 20, 427145) Today one anna’s worth of yarn in the rupee is demanded.
('87', 295, 2, 21, 427202) But this is only the beginning.
('87', 295, 2, 22, 427234) When people have understood and learnt how to spin, then khadi will be given only in full exchange for yarn spun.
('87', 295, 2, 23, 427348) I hope that as days go by everyone will himself insist on buying khadi only in exchange of yarn.
('87', 295, 2, 24, 427445) If this does not happen and if they give yarn grudgingly swaraj through non violence is impossible.
('87', 295, 2, 25, 427545) Surely some effort has to be made for swaraj.
('87', 295, 2, 26, 427591) It cannot be had by mere begging.
('87', 295, 2, 27, 427625) A certain kind of freedom can of course be obtained on the strength of the rifle, but it will not be real swaraj and I for one am not interested in it.
('87', 295, 2, 28, 427777) The very idea of obtaining swaraj through the rifle makes my head reel and a mountain of difficulties appears before my eyes.
('87', 295, 2, 29, 427903) Thisarticle is not meant for those who would obtain swaraj through the rifle.
('87', 295, 2, 30, 427981) Why should they wear khadi at all?
('87', 295, 2, 31, 428016) From their point of view khadi can be proved to be quite a useless thing.

('87', 296, 1, 2, 428156) should realize that if khadi is to be produced by villagers, not for their own use but for sale in cities, and if crores of villagers themselves are to use only mill cloth, then khadi will be of very little avail.
('87', 296, 1, 3, 428370) How can we rest content if khadi merely puts a few coppers into the pockets of the poor?
('87', 296, 1, 4, 428459) A doubt is raised that this new rule will kill the khadi which is now being produced by the poor and will make the wearing of khadi spun by themselves a matter of fashion only for a few select city dwellers.
('87', 296, 1, 5, 428667) This idea, however, displays ignorance.
('87', 296, 1, 6, 428707) The masses do not eat for fashion but in order that they may live.
('87', 296, 1, 7, 428774) Similarly they do not wear clothes for fashion, but for protection.
('87', 296, 1, 8, 428842) Therefore the charkha, like the oven, should find a place in every house and every able bodied person should spin.
('87', 296, 1, 9, 428957) Then all can wear khadi and obtain swaraj.
('87', 296, 1, 10, 429000) Able bodied persons should spin also for the crippled and the weak.
('87', 296, 1, 11, 429068) If games clubs demanding both energy and money can be run, as they are, why cannot swaraj clubs or charkha clubs be run where people can make slivers, spin and get khadi in exchange of yarn?
('87', 296, 1, 12, 429259) The truth is that where there is no will, unfavour able arguments present themselves and where there is a will, the will itself discovers favourable arguments.
('87', 296, 1, 13, 429419) If the will is strong nobody will give up the charkha even as nobody leaves games.
('87', 296, 1, 14, 429502) If the will can be found for games, can it not be found also for swaraj?
('87', 296, 1, 15, 429575) A powerful argument advanced against the system of exchang ing khadi for yarn is that if city people produce their own yarn the khadi produced by the poor will vanish and the little relief that has till now been given to them through khadi will stop, and the hope of seeing villagers clad in khadi produced by themselves will remain only a dream.
('87', 296, 1, 16, 429922) Supposing city people give up wearing khadi out of laziness or anger and villagers give up spinning and weaving for want of demand, what great loss is it to the country?
('87', 296, 1, 17, 430092) The poor people will take to other occupations in the place of khadi and will somehow make their living.
('87', 296, 1, 18, 430197) Such people will not be found in crores but only in lakhs as at present.
('87', 296, 1, 19, 430270) Those who are engaged in bidi making earn four times what is possible through spinning, or even more.
('87', 296, 1, 20, 430372) Many of the mill labourers have become rich.
('87', 296, 1, 21, 430417) This means that those who are starving today will starve still further till they die, and the few of them who can earn well will ride roughshod over the rest.
('87', 296, 1, 22, 430576) If more mills are increased and the number of cities is increased it will not make Indiaprosperous.
('87', 296, 1, 23, 430676) On the other hand it will make crores die of starvation and of the many diseases produced by starvation.
('87', 296, 1, 24, 430781) If city people are pleased with such a spectacle I have nothing to say.
('87', 296, 1, 25, 430853) Then it
('87', 297, 0, 1, 430861) 298 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('87', 297, 1, 2, 430903) will be the reign of violence, not of non violence and truth, and I will admit that in that case khadi will have no place, it can have no place.
('87', 297, 1, 3, 431048) Then military training will be compulsory whether we like it or not.
('87', 297, 1, 4, 431117) But what I am talking about relates to the crores of the starving people.
('87', 297, 1, 5, 431191) If they are to live, and live well, the charkha will have to be central and spinning undertaken voluntarily also by those who do not need to spin.
('87', 297, 1, 6, 431338) The weapons of non violence must not be adopted by people because they have no other alternative.
('87', 297, 1, 7, 431436) Therefore to my mind the rule of yarn for khadi which has been introduced has to exist and increase in its application.
('87', 297, 1, 8, 431556) Exactly for the same reason, if all the khadi bhandars have to be closed down and khadi wearers give up khadi I will regard it as a triumph of truth, because then I shall understand that people had no belief in non violence and that if they wore khadi they did it out of ignorance and thereby merely deceived themselves into thinking that by wearing khadi they would somehow get swaraj.
('87', 297, 1, 9, 431943) Why should I thus allow people to deceive themselves when I know that such khadi will not bring swaraj and that it will be discarded after swaraj is obtained?
('87', 297, 1, 10, 432102) In that case the prophecy of the late Chintamani 1
('87', 297, 2, 11, 432153) will come true that on Gandhi’s death people will laugh at khadi and also at him and will burn his body with the charkhas they may have in their houses.
('87', 297, 2, 12, 432306) If hand spun yarn cannot represent non violence, why should I not retrieve my error while I am still alive and save the wood used in the charkhas?
('87', 297, 2, 13, 432453) But I do not regard that prophecy as true.
('87', 297, 2, 14, 432496) People have understood that the crores of India cannot obtain freedom through violence.
('87', 297, 2, 15, 432584) India occupies or will soon occupy a great place in the world.
('87', 297, 2, 16, 432647) That will be possible only through non violence.
('87', 297, 2, 17, 432696) If the crores of our people want to demonstrate the workability of non violence they can do it only by making the charkha central.
('87', 297, 2, 18, 432827) As the desire for freedom is strong amongst city folks it is their duty to understand this and to take to spinning and khadi wearing in order to obtain non violent swaraj.

('87', 299, 2, 3, 434270) SEVAGRAM, August 1, 1945
('87', 299, 3, 4, 434295) BHAI KAKUBHAI, I have your letter.
('87', 299, 3, 5, 434330) Kanu has given me the details in writing, but I shall not go into them.
('87', 299, 3, 6, 434402) All this misunderstanding arose because I could not explain myself fully.
('87', 299, 3, 7, 434476) “God has tied me with a cotton thread.
('87', 299, 3, 8, 434515) Whichever way he pulls me I am His.
('87', 299, 3, 9, 434551) I am pierced by the dagger of love.” This is from a famous bhajan of Mirabai.
('87', 299, 3, 10, 434629) Swaraj hangs by that thread; it does not snap because the weight is that of love.
('87', 299, 3, 11, 434711) The languages of India are full of allegories featuring yarn.
('87', 299, 3, 12, 434773) Narandas has conceived of a yarn bank.
('87', 299, 3, 13, 434812) If such a bank is organized well, it will ultimately beat the money banks.
('87', 299, 3, 14, 434887) Narandas is a supreme devotee of khadi.
('87', 299, 3, 15, 434927) None among us can beat him in his tapascharya.
('87', 299, 3, 16, 434974) He has no other work.
('87', 299, 3, 17, 434996) I am a witness to the work he has done for the charkha.
('87', 299, 3, 18, 435052) I am a lover of his work.
('87', 299, 3, 19, 435078) He has added immensely to the importance of Rentia Baras 1. It is not a work of Kathiawaris alone and this time Kathiawaris alone are not to do it.
('87', 299, 3, 20, 435226) In this scheme the Charkha Sangh was to play a major role and its benefit would have been also quite large.
('87', 299, 3, 21, 435334) Kanu after finishing his work in Bombay was to proceed further.
('87', 299, 3, 22, 435398) Collection of funds was Of secondary importance.
('87', 299, 3, 23, 435447) Yarn was the main thing.
('87', 299, 3, 24, 435472) The Charkha Sangh had to collect only the yarn delivered at its door and send the acknowledgement to Narandas’s bank.
('87', 299, 3, 25, 435590) The ownership of the yarn would have certainly remained with the Charkha Sangh.
('87', 299, 3, 26, 435670) Suppose yarn worth crores of rupees was produced, the Charkha Sangh would have got it without striving.
('87', 299, 3, 27, 435774) Kanu is a child, an errand boy.
('87', 299, 3, 28, 435806) He is not a leader.
('87', 299, 3, 29, 435826) He could not explain what he wanted to say.
('87', 299, 3, 30, 435870) From what he says he did not absent himself so as to humiliate you.
('87', 299, 3, 31, 435938) This thing was such that there was no need for explanation.
('87', 299, 3, 32, 435998) Goddess Lakshmi was to come to your door to bless you.
('87', 299, 3, 33, 436053) However, what has happened has happened.
('87', 299, 3, 34, 436094) I do not think it can be rectified.
('87', 299, 3, 35, 436130) Do whatever you can.
('87', 299, 3, 36, 436151) I had reckoned that Kanu would go from house to house, revivespinning, repair charkhas, enrol volunteers, collect yarn, and that well tied bales of yarn would be heaped at your place.
('87', 299, 4, 37, 436335) 1 Bhadrapad Vad 12, Gandhiji’s birthday according to the Vikram calendar, was observed as spinning day.

('87', 301, 7, 12, 438074) DEAR FRIEND, Shri Sudhir Ghosh kindly gave me copies of your two speeches, one of which I finished yesterday during moments snatched from my daily work.
('87', 301, 7, 13, 438227) I write this to draw attention to two things for the moment.
('87', 301, 7, 14, 438288) Cloth shortage you can deal with without delay by following the policy laid down by the All India Spinners’ Association which is represented in Bengal too.
('87', 301, 7, 15, 438444) In one sentence the scheme is to ask every home practically to spin its cotton and every village to weave its own cloth.
('87', 301, 7, 16, 438565) It is the largest co operative effort that can be conceived in the world.
('87', 301, 7, 17, 438639) The second is the cattle question.
('87', 301, 7, 18, 438674) For that you should meet Shri Satis Chandra Das Gupta of Khadi Pratishthan.
('87', 301, 7, 19, 438750) He is ailing andmay not be available just now.
('87', 301, 7, 20, 438797) He has just published a monumental work 1
('87', 301, 8, 21, 438839) on the question.
('87', 301, 8, 22, 438856) Shri Sudhir Ghosh has given me your message about my visiting Bengal.

('87', 302, 7, 24, 440102) 1 I did not feel it was right to say anything when I had only seen the newspaper.
('87', 302, 7, 25, 440184) Now that I have received the letter I shall be writing something.
('87', 302, 7, 26, 440250) I have seen the telegram Rajaji has sent you.
('87', 302, 7, 27, 440296) I agree with it.
('87', 302, 7, 28, 440313) I [saw] something in the Press by way of a directive from you about providing for the relatives of those who died [during the struggle] in 1942 and afterwards.
('87', 302, 7, 29, 440473) The financial help we are at present giving to such relatives for their maintenance and education is something different.
('87', 302, 7, 30, 440595) In my opinion if we go by truth and non violence we cannot give such assistance.
('87', 302, 7, 31, 440676) How can we say that all of them died for the country, that they sacrificed themselves for the cause of swaraj?
('87', 302, 7, 32, 440787) I feel that under no circumstances can you do that.
('87', 302, 7, 33, 440839) If I may advise you, I would ask you to withdraw the statement.
('87', 302, 7, 34, 440903) I do not know whether there is still time for that.

('87', 303, 5, 18, 442000) Vidya 3 was good but cannot take the place of God.
('87', 303, 5, 19, 442051) I am an iconoclast.
('87', 303, 5, 20, 442071) So I wanted you to forget Vidya.
('87', 303, 5, 21, 442104) But we see God in numerous images.
('87', 303, 5, 22, 442139) You have chosen to see God in the image of Vidya.
('87', 303, 5, 23, 442189) So long as the delusion persists who can make you understand?
('87', 303, 5, 24, 442251) If you can forget her easily do so.
('87', 303, 5, 25, 442287) Then Vidya will rise and also you.
('87', 303, 5, 26, 442322) Nowadays my movements are very uncertain.

('87', 304, 3, 5, 442902) I showed him your letter.
('87', 304, 3, 6, 442928) He said: “The fact is that both mentioned that Zohrabehn’s heart was not there.
('87', 304, 3, 7, 443008) We now want Zohrabehn to go to Darussalaam.
('87', 304, 3, 8, 443052) Ever since her son was gone she has been unhappy and she finds the house on Rajpur Road dreary.
('87', 304, 3, 9, 443148) We appreciate the difficulties of Abdul Huq Saheb.
('87', 304, 3, 10, 443199) He may therefore occupy the houseon Rajpur Road.
('87', 304, 3, 11, 443248) The rent is not much.
('87', 304, 3, 12, 443270) It is a little less commodious and therefore till he can make some other arrangement he can keep the store of Urdu Anjuman 1 on the ground floor of Darussalaam.
('87', 304, 3, 13, 443431) Abdul Huq Saheb himself may fix the rent.” In my opinion the proposal is fair.
('87', 304, 3, 14, 443510) You are all like a family.
('87', 304, 3, 15, 443537) Everything will be all right if you can agree to this.
('87', 304, 3, 16, 443592) Ghalib Saheb is leaving tomorrow.
('87', 304, 3, 17, 443626) Zohra is still in Hyderabad.

('87', 304, 7, 24, 443858) You are a most responsible man.
('87', 304, 7, 25, 443890) Whatever the goading by Gopal Reddy you should have been silent or said just one word.
('87', 304, 7, 26, 443977) And what an occasion!

('87', 304, 8, 29, 444347) However, on July 22, 1945, in the light of Gandhiji’s reply dated July 15, 1943 (vide “Letter to Additional Secretary, Home Department, Government of India”, 15 7 1943.), to the Government on the Andhra Circular, he modified his earlier statement and said that Gandhiji “had no knowledge of any such Circular.

('87', 305, 5, 9, 445049) WARDHA, August 3, 1945 I have now read the report of Dr. Pattabhi’s Telugu speech at Masulipatam and the correct version given by him later.
('87', 305, 5, 10, 445190) 3 I have also corresponded with him and am now able to answer the reporters who taxed me about it the other day.
('87', 305, 5, 11, 445303) I have re read the relevant portion 4 of my reply to the Government publication called Congress Responsibility for the Disturbances, 1942 43. I have nothing to amend or correct in my references to the Andhra Circular.
('87', 305, 5, 12, 445521) Dr. Pattabhi and others as friends and fellow workers did have conversations with me on the topic of the day.
('87', 305, 5, 13, 445631) I have naturally no record of those talks nor did I authorize publication of the talks.
('87', 305, 5, 14, 445719) I have however contemporaneous evidence of what I had in mind on 7th of August, 1942. My draft instructions 5 were circulated among Members of the Working Committee on 8th August.
('87', 305, 5, 15, 445899) They were to be considered on 9th August, but before they could be considered, Members of the Working Committee and I were arrested.
('87', 305, 5, 16, 446032) Hence no authorized instructions were or could be issued.

('87', 307, 1, 4, 448461) Why need you spend your indefatigableand boundless energy for that?

('87', 307, 1, 7, 448635) Do not mind if, in that case, the khadi has to be sent outside.
('87', 307, 1, 8, 448699) If you do not have such implicit faith, you may go on doing khadi work from outside the Charkha Sangh.

('87', 311, 7, 9, 453675) August 4, 1945
('87', 311, 8, 10, 453690) MADHAVDAS, Dr. Krishnavarma has sent all the reports about you.
('87', 311, 8, 11, 453754) Kunvarji 1
('87', 311, 9, 12, 453765) has also written a postcard.
('87', 311, 9, 13, 453794) Dr. Krishnavarma has no interest in keeping you.
('87', 311, 9, 14, 453843) He has kept you only for my sake.
('87', 311, 9, 15, 453877) He kept Sailen also in the same way.
('87', 311, 9, 16, 453914) Your good lies in remaining underDr. Krishnavarma’s treatment and following his instructions.
('87', 311, 9, 17, 454008) I think I know Dr. Krishnavarma’s virtues and failings.
('87', 311, 9, 18, 454064) For his failings he will be answerable to God.
('87', 311, 9, 19, 454111) I see and cling to his virtues.
('87', 311, 9, 20, 454143) Many allegations are made against him.
('87', 311, 9, 21, 454182) Who is immune to them?
('87', 311, 9, 22, 454205) I do not care for such allegations.
('87', 311, 9, 23, 454241) I have seen with my own eyes how he looked after Ba.
('87', 311, 9, 24, 454294) I think he had seen Ba’s virtues and became a great admirer of hers.
('87', 311, 9, 25, 454363) The knowledge that you are Ba’s brother prompts him to keep you and look after you.
('87', 311, 9, 26, 454447) You need not worry about how much you will have to pay him.
('87', 311, 9, 27, 454507) The doctor has told me that he does not want a single pie, but I have decided that, if you agree, I shall pay him what I think proper from out of your own possessions.
('87', 311, 9, 28, 454675) I have discussed this with Manilal too.
('87', 311, 9, 29, 454715) But if you are not willing to pay a single pie, well, a lot of money has already been spent over you and this will be some more.
('87', 311, 9, 30, 454844) It will be to the good if you get well and can live a normal life.
('87', 311, 9, 31, 454911) However, Ba’s last words to me about you were: “You have done what you could for Madhavdas, I did what I could as his sister, and made you do what you could for him.

('87', 312, 1, 2, 455200) him.” This is what she said about you and Harilal.
('87', 312, 1, 3, 455251) I know that these words proceeded from her anger, but also from her love.
('87', 312, 1, 4, 455325) I have not, therefore, obeyed those words literally.
('87', 312, 1, 5, 455378) Now do what you wish, with God, whom you believe you worship every day, as witness.
('87', 312, 1, 6, 455462) Of one thing you may be sure, that I will not be able to keep you in the Ashram, nor can I cure you.
('87', 312, 1, 7, 455563) And remember also that no relation will be able to accommodate you.
('87', 312, 1, 8, 455631) Society is so constituted that even though a person may wish to do something he is not able to do it, cannot do it.
('87', 312, 1, 9, 455747) Ultimately, everyone has to turn to God, and only what He does or permits is possible.
('87', 312, 1, 10, 455834) If you can think, then after reading this letter stay where you are.
('87', 312, 1, 11, 455903) If you cannot think, then also, do not do anything in a hurry but stay there.

('87', 312, 6, 17, 456107) BHAI KRISHNAVARMA, Please read the enclosed letter and then pass it on to Mama.
('87', 312, 6, 18, 456187) I read your whole letter yesterday, till then I was not able fully to go through it.
('87', 312, 6, 19, 456272) I agree with what you say.
('87', 312, 6, 20, 456299) I have given Mama some idea of you in my letter to him.
('87', 312, 6, 21, 456355) I had observed even when you were here that you had no control over your tongue.
('87', 312, 6, 22, 456436) You do not observe the rules of cleanliness—maybe, you do not even know them.
('87', 312, 6, 23, 456514) I had noticed that also when you were here.
('87', 312, 6, 24, 456558) I presume you are doing the same there.
('87', 312, 6, 25, 456598) Kanti Mashruwala is an admirer of yours.
('87', 312, 6, 26, 456639) Manilal had been there.
('87', 312, 6, 27, 456663) He is not an admirer of you but he is wise.
('87', 312, 6, 28, 456707) He has seen something of the world.
('87', 312, 6, 29, 456743) He recognizes your qualities.
('87', 312, 6, 30, 456773) He believes that you are no doubt good at heart but he also believes that you do not observe the rules of cleanliness nor make others do so.
('87', 312, 6, 31, 456914) I only know your goodness and therefore wish that your shortcomings may disappear.
('87', 312, 6, 32, 456997) I know that I have served my own interest in sending Mama to you and I still want to keep him there.
('87', 312, 6, 33, 457098) He will be in a very bad plight if he goes away from there.
('87', 312, 6, 34, 457158) I cannot keep him in the Ashram, as it will be against the spirit of the Ashram.
('87', 312, 6, 35, 457239) I do not think he can stay anywhere else.
('87', 312, 6, 36, 457281) Whatever has to be done, you alone can do.
('87', 312, 6, 37, 457324) As you have started a hospital it certainly is your duty.

('87', 313, 1, 3, 457468) You must know the rules of cleanliness and observe them meticulously.
('87', 313, 1, 4, 457538) There are too many mosquitoes there.
('87', 313, 1, 5, 457575) Just because you are taking work from the poor women you should not put up with their indifferent performance.
('87', 313, 1, 6, 457686) As a doctor and a householder it is your duty to teach them cleanliness.
('87', 313, 1, 7, 457759) It should be your job to eradicate mosquitoes from the neighbourhood.
('87', 313, 1, 8, 457829) You should know how to do that.
('87', 313, 1, 9, 457861) How can you call yourself a nature cure doctor if you do not do all these things?
('87', 313, 1, 10, 457943) I can write much along these lines but I am sure you are one of those to whom a word is enough.
('87', 313, 1, 11, 458039) For this reason and also because I do not have the time I am not prolonging the letter.
('87', 313, 1, 12, 458127) I understand about Sailen.
('87', 313, 1, 13, 458154) Encash the cheque he has sent to you.
('87', 313, 1, 14, 458192) I won’t think it is your fee by any means.
('87', 313, 1, 15, 458235) I know you did notkeep Sailen for the sake of fee.
('87', 313, 1, 16, 458286) But I thought he should on his own put into the charity box whatever he could afford and therefore asked him to send the cheque.
('87', 313, 1, 17, 458415) Get the cheque cashed and utilize the money for charity.
('87', 313, 1, 18, 458472) I do not advise you to come here.
('87', 313, 1, 19, 458506) The main reason of course is that I do not have the time.
('87', 313, 1, 20, 458564) Otherwise I would be happy if I could keep you here and give you training in cleanliness.
('87', 313, 1, 21, 458654) But that is not possible at the moment.
('87', 313, 1, 22, 458694) I shall call you when such an occasion arises.
('87', 313, 1, 23, 458741) However, if you want to come on your own, want to be reassured and if you do come, it will be a different matter.

('87', 313, 6, 30, 459021) You write that Mama should be allowed to go where he wants.
('87', 313, 6, 31, 459081) I do not understand this, nor does Manilal.
('87', 313, 6, 32, 459125) Where will he go?
('87', 313, 6, 33, 459143) Where will he stay?
('87', 313, 6, 34, 459163) Are you going to keep him?
('87', 313, 6, 35, 459190) If you think he can stay in the Ashram, that is not possible.
('87', 313, 6, 36, 459252) Have you considered what would happen if he were to go and stay in his own house?
('87', 313, 6, 37, 459334) Mama has gone to Malad of his own free will.
('87', 313, 6, 38, 459379) When he asked me to send him to Malad I was not willing to do so.
('87', 313, 6, 39, 459445) I requested Dr. Krishnavarma when Manilal pleaded on his behalf.
('87', 313, 6, 40, 459510) It requires but one moment to remove him from there, but I believe that it would harm

('87', 314, 5, 12, 460125) WARDHA, August 4, 1945 Several Congressmen have asked me questions relating to the Congress programme.
('87', 314, 5, 13, 460228) Cablegrams too have been received from London and other places.
('87', 314, 5, 14, 460292) I am sorry I have not been able to acknowledge them.
('87', 314, 5, 15, 460345) The reason, however, is and should be obvious.
('87', 314, 5, 16, 460392) In the absence of the Maulana Saheb and other members of the Working Committee, it is true I took upon myself the responsibility to give such advice as I was capable of giving in regard to Congress matters.
('87', 314, 5, 17, 460599) Now that the Working Committee is out, I can only give advice through the Maulana Saheb and the Working Committee.
('87', 314, 5, 18, 460714) My advice, independently given, may be in conflict with their opinion and it may embarrass them and even put them or me in a wrong position and, what is more, may confuse the public mind.
('87', 314, 5, 19, 460902) Therefore, I should warn all here and outside India against making any reference to me on such questions as are properly for the President and the Working Com mittee to advise upon.

('87', 315, 2, 3, 461176) August 4, 1945 I said then and I repeat now that my offer to Mr. Jinnah was not in the nature of a bargain.
('87', 315, 2, 4, 461284) 1 It was my settled conviction though originally derived from Rajaji 2. I am not in the habit of deriving anything from anybody, however great he is, unless I can appropriate and assimilate it for myself.
('87', 315, 2, 5, 461489) Therefore even if Rajaji went back on that Formula, I shall stick to it so long as I retain my sanity.
('87', 315, 2, 6, 461592) I hold it to be substantial and also directly derivable from the Congress Resolutions and immediately from the Resolution of August 8, 1942. Only I have given it concrete shape.

('87', 317, 3, 5, 463620) Through non attachment devotion to someone can be transformed into devotion to God.
('87', 317, 3, 6, 463704) If such devotion is not linked with devotion to God, it becomes infatuation and assumes a dangerous form.
('87', 317, 3, 7, 463810) You two have spared no effort in the service of Harilal.
('87', 317, 3, 8, 463867) I had felt all along that Harilal would ultimately act as he had always done.
('87', 317, 3, 9, 463945) But let not this worry you in the least.
('87', 317, 3, 10, 463986) You should be thankful if even the last rites fell to your lot to perform.
('87', 317, 3, 11, 464061) You have shown devotion in many ways.
('87', 317, 3, 12, 464099) All that devotion will have achieved fulfilment if now you turn it into devotion to God.
('87', 317, 3, 13, 464188) And true devotion to God as I see itnow is devotion to Sutranarayana 2. The word Daridranarayana 3 was first used by Vivekananda (if my memory serves me right, for I am not quite sure whether it was he or some other holy man who used it first).
('87', 317, 3, 14, 464433) The word Satyanarayana 4 is well known.
('87', 317, 3, 15, 464473) But as God of action it is Sutranarayana who reveals Himself to me.
('87', 317, 3, 16, 464541) You have started worship of that God.
('87', 317, 3, 17, 464579) Understand His nature properly.
('87', 317, 3, 18, 464611) Rise above the intrigues there or anywhere else.
('87', 317, 3, 19, 464660) If you do not show the slightest softness to Harilal, he will leave Mysore.
('87', 317, 3, 20, 464736) Try to find out, if you can, how he managed to obtain Rs. 200 from the Maharaja of Mysore.
('87', 317, 3, 21, 464827) You may tell me, when we meet, the other things which you have on your mind.
('87', 317, 3, 22, 464904) But do not worry if you cannot.
('87', 317, 3, 23, 464936) If you wish to write about them, have no hesitation in doing so.
('87', 317, 3, 24, 465001) See that Saraswati 5 and you devote yourselves to your studies and complete them.
('87', 317, 4, 25, 465083) Blessings to both of you from BAPU

('87', 318, 1, 2, 465357) 544. LETTER TO RAMDAS GANDHI
('87', 318, 2, 3, 465386) August 5, 1945
('87', 318, 3, 4, 465401) RAMDAS, You have used reasoning in your letter which, however, does not appeal to me.
('87', 318, 3, 5, 465487) You have a right to go to Dinshaw’s because he has made you his own.
('87', 318, 3, 6, 465556) Dinshaw is imbued with the spirit of altruism, even towards the poorest.
('87', 318, 3, 7, 465629) His is not an organization for the poor.
('87', 318, 3, 8, 465670) Similarly it is not for the rich.
('87', 318, 3, 9, 465704) However, both can go there as also those belonging to the middle class; that is possible because of Dinshaw’s good nature.
('87', 318, 3, 10, 465827) Moreover, you had no right to use reasoning the way you have, for you had given me to understand that you were about to take long leave, or had taken it, and would be devoting a year to improving your health.
('87', 318, 3, 11, 466036) Of course you will have yourself treated there and think of going to Dinshaw only after you have completely ruined your health.
('87', 318, 3, 12, 466164) As you will yourself admit you could not perceive Dinshaw’s love for you.
('87', 318, 3, 13, 466238) I therefore even now advise you to take oneyear’s leave and go to Dinshaw’s.
('87', 318, 3, 14, 466315) As I have already told you, I shall manage to find your one year’s expenses from somewhere.
('87', 318, 3, 15, 466407) I shall not pay from the Ashram funds but seek money for you from somewhere.
('87', 318, 3, 16, 466484) I have forgotten what arrangement was made about the expenditure.
('87', 318, 3, 17, 466550) However, explain that to me again and I will act accordingly.
('87', 318, 3, 18, 466612) You have something that attracts older persons to you.
('87', 318, 3, 19, 466667) I myself do not know what it is but I have firsthand knowledge of it.
('87', 318, 3, 20, 466737) Dinshaw knows many of my people but he is not drawn to them.
('87', 318, 3, 21, 466798) But he is attracted to you.
('87', 318, 3, 22, 466826) Most probably you yourself do not know why that is so.
('87', 318, 3, 23, 466881) This is one of the instances.
('87', 318, 3, 24, 466911) I have many others in my mind.
('87', 318, 3, 25, 466942) It would therefore be better if you did not argue over the matter and went to Dinshaw’s.
('87', 318, 3, 26, 467031) If you both want to go you may.
('87', 318, 3, 27, 467063) It will be enough for you to wind up the establishment from there for one year.
('87', 318, 3, 28, 467143) There are numerous teaching institutions in Poona.
('87', 318, 3, 29, 467194) Kanam and Usha won’t have any difficulty in learning Marathi if they have to.
('87', 318, 3, 30, 467272) Manilal and Sushila will be arriving tomorrow.
('87', 318, 3, 31, 467319) Sita will stay on in Akola.
('87', 318, 3, 32, 467347) She is engrossed in her studies.
('87', 318, 3, 33, 467380) I am still of the opinion that Nimu 1 did well in not going either to Delhi or to Simla.
('87', 318, 3, 34, 467469) There is no point in making Sumi 2 dependent on
('87', 318, 4, 35, 467517) 1 Nirmala, addressee’s wife 2 Sumitra, addressee’s daughter
('87', 319, 0, 1, 467577) 320 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('87', 319, 1, 2, 467619) I can understand parents’ attachment.
('87', 319, 1, 3, 467657) However, this time I have seen that neither Nimu nor you could have done anything more for Sumi than what Devdas and Lakshmi did for her.
('87', 319, 1, 4, 467795) I noticed that they looked after Sumi in the same way as they look after their own children.
('87', 319, 1, 5, 467888) Sumi gave me the impression that she also held the same view.
('87', 319, 1, 6, 467950) She is quite at home with the children there.
('87', 319, 1, 7, 467996) Ultimately, isn’t God the Protector of all?
('87', 319, 1, 8, 468040) Gopaldas’s and Nalini’s son was gone in a moment while they helplessly looked on.
('87', 319, 1, 9, 468122) 1 Nalini could not save him.
('87', 319, 1, 10, 468151) There are so many such instances.

('87', 319, 6, 16, 468375) SUMI, I notice that even now you do not worship pure truth.
('87', 319, 6, 17, 468435) You do not even fulfil the promises you gave me.
('87', 319, 6, 18, 468484) What is the meaning of your pining for Nimu when you have accepted Devdas and Lakshmi as your parents?
('87', 319, 6, 19, 468587) They of course treat you accordingly.
('87', 319, 6, 20, 468625) We should be content with the situation in which we place ourselves or are placed.
('87', 319, 6, 21, 468708) For the sake of the love Devdas and Lakshmi cherish for you, you must protect your health, your eyes.
('87', 319, 6, 22, 468810) Why should you put yourself through the strain of an examination?
('87', 319, 6, 23, 468876) Why should you force yourself to finish a specified course within a specified time?
('87', 319, 6, 24, 468960) You have to preserve your eyes, your intellect and your body in order to continue with your studies.
('87', 319, 6, 25, 469061) This is such an obvious truth that it does not need any explanation.
('87', 319, 6, 26, 469130) It is self evident.
('87', 319, 6, 27, 469150) Hence the Gujarati saying: the health of the body is the first happiness.
('87', 319, 6, 28, 469224) So allay Ramdas’s and Nimu’s fears by studying without becoming restless and improving your health.
('87', 319, 6, 29, 469324) Bring credit to the love Devdas and Lakskmi have for you and be worthy of it.

('87', 320, 9, 20, 470297) KRISHNACHANDRA, It is the same to an inmate of the Ashram whether he works as a manager or as a sweeper.
('87', 320, 9, 21, 470402) Being a sweeper probably entails a greater responsibility.
('87', 320, 9, 22, 470461) In being a manager there is no authority, only service.
('87', 320, 9, 23, 470517) One should be prepared for both.
('87', 320, 9, 24, 470550) If one finds being a sweeper pleasant and being a manager unpleasant, it is a sign of ignorance.
('87', 320, 9, 25, 470647) And, if being a manager smacks of authority it means one is conceited.
('87', 320, 9, 26, 470718) Keep yourself ready for managership.
('87', 320, 9, 27, 470755) Do not bother about whether or not you get it.

('87', 322, 8, 15, 472644) I am sure you will have realized by now that one has to reply to points which strike one’s eye.
('87', 322, 8, 16, 472740) 2. Since you are the Manager, you should treat nothing as private.
('87', 322, 8, 17, 472807) 3. This reply is meant for all.
('87', 322, 8, 18, 472839) If you wish, you may treat your letter as private.
('87', 322, 8, 19, 472890) 4. Instead of compelling the women to attend the prayer, you should explain to them their dharma and then leave the matter to them.
('87', 322, 8, 20, 473022) You cannot claim greater right or control over Kanchan than over the other women.
('87', 322, 8, 21, 473104) If you look upon Kanchan as your wife and wish to have children by her or gratify physical or mental craving through her, you should resign as Manager, notwithstanding your many other virtues and endowments.
('87', 322, 8, 22, 473312) That is to say, you should treat Kanchan as completely independent.
('87', 322, 8, 23, 473380) 5. Utilize Pushpa’s services to the full.
('87', 322, 8, 24, 473422) She must learn to recite the Gita with correct pronunciation.
('87', 322, 8, 25, 473484) She can sing too.

('87', 323, 1, 8, 473992) He is a Harijan.
('87', 323, 1, 9, 474009) It is our duty to serve him.
('87', 323, 1, 10, 474038) This does not mean that we should spoil him.

('87', 323, 1, 14, 474263) It is necessary to understand him.
('87', 323, 1, 15, 474298) I have been training him.
('87', 323, 1, 16, 474324) If you do not think he may be a lustful man, you may let him teach the women, not where he would be alone with them but in a big room, or on my verandah or, if Sushila Gandhi permits, in Ba’s room.
('87', 323, 1, 17, 474522) Even if a man is a perfect brahmachari, he should never be alone with a woman.
('87', 323, 1, 18, 474601) 9. Ramnarayan 1 will have to pay all the expenses.
('87', 323, 1, 19, 474652) Since the girls are to be given modern education outside, he will not be considered an Ashram inmate.
('87', 323, 1, 20, 474754) If he himself, however, wishes to stay here till he gets a house outside, he may pay nominal rent and stay.
('87', 323, 1, 21, 474862) But he should not have a separate kitchen.
('87', 323, 1, 22, 474905) Lanterns too should be shared as far as possible.
('87', 323, 1, 23, 474955) Even if he is ready to pay for them, we cannot give any just now.

('87', 323, 1, 25, 475098) Discuss this with Kanaiyo and Mohansinh.
('87', 323, 1, 26, 475139) All those who wish to read should do so silently round one or two lamps.
('87', 323, 1, 27, 475212) And the same for writing.
('87', 323, 1, 28, 475238) We must economize on kerosene.

('87', 323, 1, 30, 475300) He should not be made to carry too heavy a financial burden.
('87', 323, 1, 31, 475361) All the expenses must be managed within Rs. 150. Everyone should be given local fruit and Bombay fruit should be reserved for the sick.
('87', 323, 1, 32, 475497) I intend to make some arrangements.
('87', 323, 1, 33, 475533) Estimate the cost of fruit from Bombay.
('87', 323, 1, 34, 475573) You should exercise discretion, moderation and gentleness in this matter.
('87', 323, 1, 35, 475647) 10. In order to know a man’s nature we must learn to tolerate his weaknesses as we expect the world to tolerate ours.
('87', 323, 1, 36, 475765) If the world did not tolerate our weaknesses it would kill us.
('87', 323, 1, 37, 475828) This applies to all, but it applies especially to the Manager who has embraced ahimsa.

('87', 324, 1, 6, 476414) 12. About the trees Parnerkar 1 says that there has been no negligence.
('87', 324, 1, 7, 476486) There has been some miscalculation, of course.
('87', 324, 1, 8, 476533) That is, the heat has harmed four or five trees more than was expected.
('87', 324, 1, 9, 476605) The rest are coming up.
('87', 324, 1, 10, 476629) Exposing the trees to heat was deliberate, so that they might bear finer and sweeter fruit.

('87', 326, 3, 5, 479066) You are right about me.
('87', 326, 3, 6, 479090) Your way is different from mine.
('87', 326, 3, 7, 479123) But I have countenanced you as you have appealed to me as an earnest man.
('87', 326, 3, 8, 479197) In spite of the testimonials you have quoted often, you have not made progress not because Congressmen have not appreciated your labours but because your unity plan has made no appeal to the general mind.
('87', 326, 3, 9, 479402) But this is a long story.
('87', 326, 3, 10, 479428) I suggest to you to look inward for your failure and not outward.
('87', 326, 3, 11, 479494) Why not do some concrete work, be it ever so little?
('87', 326, 3, 12, 479547) And then there will be no failure.
('87', 326, 3, 13, 479582) For concrete work is its own success.

('87', 327, 13, 19, 481065) [Before August 8, 1945] 2
('87', 327, 14, 20, 481091) This is what the Editor of the Gram Udyog Patrika tells me:
('87', 327, 15, 21, 481151) I am afraid your last article 3 in regard to why people should give yarn for khadi is not convincing.
('87', 327, 15, 22, 481253) Your whole argument rests on the view, which is repeated several times in the course of your article, that non violent swaraj is impossible unless everybody spins.
('87', 327, 15, 23, 481417) This crucial point, however, is never explained, but taken for granted and asserted repeatedly.
('87', 327, 15, 24, 481513) Unless you can show
('87', 327, 16, 25, 481533) 1 From the reference to the letter to Atulanand Chakravarty dated August 7, 1945; vide “Letter to Atulanand Chakravarty”, 7 8 1945. 2 The article appeared in The Hindu, 11 8 1945, under the date line “Bombay, August 8”.
('87', 327, 16, 26, 481753) 3Vide “Why Khadi for yarn and not for money?”, july 1945.
('87', 328, 0, 1, 481811) VOL. 87: 29 MAY, 1945 29 AUGUST, 1945 329
('87', 328, 1, 2, 481853) what connection there is between non violent swaraj and the people of all kinds—even those who have more profitable occupation—taking to the charkha for their cloth requirements, your argument cannot convince those who honestly feel that your asking them to spin, if they want to use khadi, even when their time can be spent more profitably, is to expect a little too much from them.
('87', 328, 1, 3, 482237) So can you perhaps provide this missing link in your argument for the next issue, and show how through spinning we can obtain non violent swaraj?
('87', 328, 1, 4, 482383) The better course this time is to answer in English.
('87', 328, 1, 5, 482436) Few, if any, readers who do not know English would ask for the “missing link”, for the very simple reason that, they know my argument showing the connection between hand spinning and swaraj obtained through non violence.
('87', 328, 1, 6, 482657) Swaraj can only be obtained by work, either violent or non violent.
('87', 328, 1, 7, 482725) Violent work we know.
('87', 328, 1, 8, 482747) It necessarily includes training in the use of the most modern weapons of destruction and all it means.
('87', 328, 1, 9, 482851) By common consent this has been ruled out.
('87', 328, 1, 10, 482894) Mere constitutional means, though non violent, went out of date long ago.
('87', 328, 1, 11, 482968) It is a superstition to think that liberty can be gained by such means in the teeth of armed opposition.
('87', 328, 1, 12, 483073) Non violent work is then the only means for winning freedom.
('87', 328, 1, 13, 483134) What is the training or work that Indians should undertake for adapting themselves for non violent efforts?
('87', 328, 1, 14, 483242) It has been shown that Indian freedom was lost when India’s chief trade in cotton fabric, which was prepared in her cottages, was destroyed and together with it many other occupations which Indians carried on to sustain that trade.
('87', 328, 1, 15, 483474) It is obvious that that trade and the allied occupations should be revived or some others consistent with non violence should be taken up.
('87', 328, 1, 16, 483613) Revival was the only thing thought of.
('87', 328, 1, 17, 483652) It was being attempted by way of copying the English or, say, the modern method of replacing human labour by means of power driven machinery.
('87', 328, 1, 18, 483794) Instinctively I rejected it [as] being a way of violence and sought to replace it by human labour [as] being a way of non violence.
('87', 328, 1, 19, 483926) The struggle between the two is going on.
('87', 328, 1, 20, 483968) In my opinion, the war that is ending has demonstrated the bankruptcy of violence.
('87', 328, 1, 21, 484051) Solvency of non violence remains to be proved.
('87', 328, 1, 22, 484098) Revival of the central trade of India by means of power driven machinery is possible only by a superior exhibition of the resourcefulness of the West.
('87', 328, 1, 23, 484249) And, if it becomes possible, it will find the masses of India no better off than now.
('87', 328, 1, 24, 484335) I advance no argument in proof of this proposition.
('87', 328, 1, 25, 484387) For, it can be studied through a perusal of my writings already published in
('87', 329, 0, 1, 484464) 330 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('87', 329, 1, 2, 484506) book form 1. Then the only form of non violent work to be done by the largest number of men, women and children of the land, in order to regain the lost trade with its attendant activities, is the spinning wheel.
('87', 329, 1, 3, 484719) Thus conceived, it easily becomes the symbol par excellence of non violence.
('87', 329, 1, 4, 484796) To be an instrument of swaraj, naturally it must not flourish under Government or any other patronage.
('87', 329, 1, 5, 484899) It must flourish, if need be, even in spite of the resistance from Government or the capitalist who is interested in his spinning and weaving mills.
('87', 329, 1, 6, 485048) The spinning wheel represents the millions in the villages as against the classes represented by the mill owners and the like.
('87', 329, 1, 7, 485175) “Assuming,” the Editor asks, “that the wheel is designed to bring in swaraj non violently, why should a person who is more usefully occupied or even disinclined spin?” The reason is more psychological than utilitarian.
('87', 329, 1, 8, 485394) The villagers have become used to imitating the city dwellers so much so that the movement is towards migration to the city slums instead of remaining in and improving their own lot in the villages.
('87', 329, 1, 9, 485593) If every person sets apart, for the sake of winning swaraj non violently, a certain time for hand spinning, an atmosphere for spinning will be created and if khadi became an article for personal use instead of being an article of commerce, which it now largely is, the question of competition with mill cloth or any other cloth will disappear and the poorest as well as the richest will be able to wear and use khadi without the slightest difficulty.
('87', 329, 1, 10, 486044) No wonder Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru has called it “the livery of our freedom”.

('87', 332, 3, 5, 488570) I did not know that you had anything to do with the thing.

('87', 332, 3, 7, 488671) I think I told you that we were living in artificial and unnatu ral atmosphere and therefore we had to have thick skins if we were to do our duty.

('87', 332, 8, 16, 489115) DEAR MENON 2, Panditji 3 has sent me your letter to him.
('87', 332, 8, 17, 489172) I am not frightened of the word ‘machine’.
('87', 332, 8, 18, 489215) Therefore, if a life giving machine can be made in India and will do the work of the spinning wheel more quickly and better, I would have it and pay a tempting prize to the inventor.
('87', 332, 8, 19, 489398) You should be informed that a fat prize was issued to the inventor of such a machine.4 The terms were advertised here and in foreign countries.
('87', 332, 8, 20, 489542) There was only one Indian inventor.

('87', 333, 11, 18, 490520) KAKA, I have your letter.
('87', 333, 11, 19, 490546) I am in two minds about whether you should or should not go to the Tilak Vidyapith.
('87', 333, 11, 20, 490630) And therefore it is best that I should express no definite opinion.
('87', 333, 11, 21, 490698)  We do not wish to enter into controversy over the Vedas.
('87', 333, 11, 22, 490756) The compositions that are today accepted as the Vedas are full of unresolved doubts.
('87', 333, 11, 23, 490841) Not all the writings have come down to us.
('87', 333, 11, 24, 490884) Even from among those which have, no one knows what is genuine and what is not.
('87', 333, 11, 25, 490964) As regards their interpretation, sheerconfusion prevails.
('87', 333, 11, 26, 491022) Hence the judgment about goodness or badness can come only from a purified conscience.
('87', 333, 11, 27, 491109) I have, therefore, taken as my guide the sloka cited by Anandshankarbhai 2 in his book:

('87', 334, 1, 2, 491296) I do not even know from where he has quoted the sloka.
('87', 334, 1, 3, 491351) It appealed to me instantly and sank into my heart, and I, therefore, got it included in the women’s prayer.
('87', 334, 1, 4, 491460) Also please remember that we got the marriage of the Harijan girl Lakskmi and Harijan Velayudhan performed according to the rite that we had accepted.
('87', 334, 1, 5, 491611) I do not remember the names of other Harijans.
('87', 334, 1, 6, 491658) But all this I consider irrelevant.
('87', 334, 1, 7, 491694) If I am right in my statement that the regeneration of Hinduism lies in our becoming Harijans, then it is very clear that a change must be made in the marriage rite in all weddings taking place in the Ashram or the ones with my blessings.
('87', 334, 1, 8, 491933) Since I have already agreed, Indu and Tendulkar should be married in the Ashram.
('87', 334, 1, 9, 492014) I am not bound as regards the rite, and, therefore, the new rite should be introduced from this wedding.
('87', 334, 1, 10, 492119) I am giving all this additional information here simply by way of background.
('87', 334, 1, 11, 492197) You may, if you wish, discuss this matter with him.
('87', 334, 1, 12, 492249) You may discuss it with Vinobaji also, and then prepare as short a text of the ceremony as possible.
('87', 334, 1, 13, 492350) Remember that this must be finalized before I leave.
('87', 334, 1, 14, 492403) I assume that you also will be accompanying me.

('87', 335, 7, 13, 493602) August 8, 1945 I have gone through the appeal 2 of the trustees.
('87', 335, 7, 14, 493667) I like it.
('87', 335, 7, 15, 493678) I hope that the entire amount they have asked for in it will be available through contributions.
('87', 335, 7, 16, 493775) I feel that much has been done for the propagation of Hindustani in the southern provinces and hope that even more will be done in the future.
('87', 335, 7, 17, 493918) People should contribute on the understanding that the money thus raised will be used for furthering the cause of the national language as I have defined it.
('87', 335, 7, 18, 494076) The national language as explained in the appeal is a language written in the Urdu or Hindi style and in the Nagari or Urdu script.
('87', 335, 7, 19, 494208) This means that the Hindi written solely in the Devanagari script cannot be called national language, nor can the language written solely in the Persian script.
('87', 335, 7, 20, 494369) The true Hindustani will be evolved only when we, who know the national language, are able to write it in both the scripts and speak in both the dictions.
('87', 335, 7, 21, 494524) There can be no doubt that even today millions of Hindus and Muslims in the North speak such a language, such Hindustani.
('87', 335, 7, 22, 494646) However, we cannot say that educated people of the North speak such Hindustani.
('87', 335, 7, 23, 494726) If it has to be our misfortune that such a state of affairs should continue, then it will continue, but it should be our

('87', 336, 1, 3, 495099) This can be the only meaning of propagating Hindustani.
('87', 336, 1, 4, 495155) Therefore the work of propagating Hindustani which is going on in South India will emphasize both the styles.
('87', 336, 1, 5, 495265) And that is the meaning of the resolution which the Congress passed in 1925 1. The resolution was:
('87', 336, 2, 6, 495364) This Congress resolves that the proceedings of the Congress, A.I.C.C. and the Congress Working Committee shall ordinarily be conducted in Hindustani.
('87', 336, 2, 7, 495514) The English language or any other provincial language may be used if the speaker is unable to speak in Hindustani or whenever necessary.

('87', 336, 6, 16, 495952) Would not your having to take quinine indicate that there was something lacking in your treatment?

('87', 336, 6, 18, 496101) My only point is that if you spend the entire sum of Rs. 25 on food and improve your health, but then have a relapse and are again obliged to take quinine, what would one have to say of your treatment?
('87', 336, 6, 19, 496303) I do not doubt your goodness but I have the gravest doubts concerning your treatment.

('87', 337, 3, 5, 496694) What would be the good of my sending for all three of you here?
('87', 337, 3, 6, 496758) It is unnecessary.
('87', 337, 3, 7, 496777) I must admit I have not understood your point.
('87', 337, 3, 8, 496824) I had understood that Anjana Devi was keen on providing modern education to Sita 1 and Subhadra 2. I do not consider it improper in any way.
('87', 337, 3, 9, 496965) While going in for Nayee Talim, she is free to send the girls elsewhere whenever she feels like it.
('87', 337, 3, 10, 497065) If they want to be educated there at present, you must stay somewhere nearby.
('87', 337, 3, 11, 497143) You will go to the Goshala when the building is ready in four to six months’ time.
('87', 337, 3, 12, 497226) Since no other accommodation is available itwould be better if it can be found in the Ashram as was done in the case of Prabhakar.
('87', 337, 3, 13, 497357) I have written to Munnalal to that effect.
('87', 337, 4, 14, 497400) Prabhakar used to cook his own food.
('87', 337, 4, 15, 497437) I did not make this applicable to you because I thought that except for the education of Sita and Subhadra you and Anjana Devi had a preference for the Ashram life.
('87', 337, 4, 16, 497602) Therefore I felt you would not need to cook separately.
('87', 337, 4, 17, 497658) But now I understand from your letter that you do not like the system at the Ashram.
('87', 337, 4, 18, 497743) If that is so the Ashram life must be something different.
('87', 337, 4, 19, 497802) But I don’t think it is so.
('87', 337, 4, 20, 497830) Understand that if the life and routine in the Ashram cause you discomfort you both, or at least Anjana Devi, will not be able to stay here in peace.
('87', 337, 4, 21, 497980) Your cooking separately will hurt me and irritate the managers.
('87', 337, 4, 22, 498044) It should not be necessary to convince you on this point.
('87', 337, 4, 23, 498102) Hence, consider the matter well and do whatever you think best.

('87', 339, 3, 4, 499269) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, It is a pity that you cannot sleep while travelling.
('87', 339, 3, 5, 499340) We shall be reaching Poona in time, and shall see what happens there.
('87', 339, 3, 6, 499410) I leave on the 19th and arrive there 1 on the 20th.
('87', 339, 3, 7, 499462) I shall spend the day there and then we shall leave for Poona on the 21st by the first train, assuming that, as before, they will offer us a third class compartment.
('87', 339, 3, 8, 499628) Mean while take some rest if you can.
('87', 339, 3, 9, 499666) If you rest, Mani also will get some rest.
('87', 339, 3, 10, 499709) I feel that she will not be able to endure the present strain for long.
('87', 339, 3, 11, 499781) Even now she is sustained only by her inexhaustible devotion to you.
('87', 339, 3, 12, 499850) But even devotion proves helpless in the face of what is but natural.
('87', 339, 3, 13, 499920) There was a vivid account in the newspapers of the Ahme dabad events.

('87', 340, 3, 8, 500352) You should, however, assume that I am staying with you.

('87', 340, 3, 12, 500506) You got a fine samadhi 1 constructed.

('87', 341, 3, 6, 501512) Your thoughts are confused.

('87', 342, 3, 4, 502440) INDU, This letter is for both of you.
('87', 342, 3, 5, 502478) I propose to solemnize your wedding on the 19th.
('87', 342, 3, 6, 502527) The ceremony is likely to be performed by Prabhakar.
('87', 342, 3, 7, 502580) He is from a Harijan family.
('87', 342, 3, 8, 502609) His parents had become Christians.
('87', 342, 3, 9, 502644) The rite is being drafted by Kakasaheb.
('87', 342, 4, 10, 502684) I assume that you approve of all this.
('87', 342, 4, 11, 502723) I think you ought to write to your elders and seek their permission.
('87', 342, 4, 12, 502792) I assume also that this marriage will not be for indulgence but for service.
('87', 342, 4, 13, 502869) I assume further that until real independence is achieved you will not consummate your marriage.
('87', 342, 4, 14, 502966) And of course I take it for granted that you will not take to contraceptive methods.
('87', 342, 4, 15, 503051) I need not say that if you find all this hard you should not feel obliged to have the marriage solemnized here.
('87', 342, 4, 16, 503163) If you approve of a marriage of this type, do regular spinning, study the 12th Chapter of the Gita with interest and understanding, and think only of public good while working in the Ashram.
('87', 342, 4, 17, 503354) Remember that in drafting this rite I have not taken the law into consideration.

('87', 344, 6, 13, 505301) SEVAGRAM, August 11, 1945 Those like me, who were interested in saving Mahendra Chowdhary from the gallows, are, I know, shocked that he was hanged at the Central Jail in Bhagalpur on August 7. Those who remain behind will have to know that many more such tragedies will take place.
('87', 344, 6, 14, 505584) Only, we must learn the lesson of each.
('87', 344, 6, 15, 505624) Let us, then, now dispassionately learn the lesson of this accomplished death sentence.
('87', 344, 6, 16, 505712) First, the Government.
('87', 344, 6, 17, 505735) They do not call it a political dacoity.
('87', 344, 6, 18, 505776) Every dacoity is not a political act.
('87', 344, 6, 19, 505814) Many professionals used the political ferment for their own ends.
('87', 344, 6, 20, 505880) Government, whether truly national or foreign, would not let such crimes go unpunished.
('87', 344, 6, 21, 505968) The authorities, in this case, held Mahendra Chowdhary to be implicated in such a dacoity and, therefore, they allowed the sentence to take the extreme course.
('87', 344, 6, 22, 506128) Now, for the popular side.
('87', 344, 6, 23, 506155) They say that Mahendra Chowdhary was a young man of twenty five.
('87', 344, 6, 24, 506220) He had no idea of taking part in a dacoity whether professional or political, so called.
('87', 344, 6, 25, 506309) He was in hiding.
('87', 344, 6, 26, 506327) He was tried after the event and sentenced on doubtful evidence.Acceptance of the evidence and the verdict depended on the whim of the judge or judges and at the time judges were, as often as not, biased.
('87', 344, 7, 27, 506532) 1 The contents of the letter indicate that this was written after the letter to the addressee dated August 10, 1945; vide “Letter to Indumati Gunaji”, 10 8 1945.
('87', 345, 0, 1, 506694) 346 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('87', 345, 1, 2, 506736) If the popular belief is founded on fact, the death was a murder, worse, reprehensible because judicial.
('87', 345, 1, 3, 506841) Who can find the truth, except a body of utterly impartial lawyers?
('87', 345, 1, 4, 506909) They have to do so from the recorded evidence and the judgements of the original and appellate courts.
('87', 345, 1, 5, 507012) Let us neither be carried away by sentiment nor lazily forget the incident, now that Mahendra Chowdhary is no more.
('87', 345, 1, 6, 507128) If Government at all care for public opinion and would not rest on the overwhelming force they have at their disposal, they will be equally interested, and will associate themselves with the public.

('87', 346, 5, 8, 508527) I like it.
('87', 346, 5, 9, 508538) Kanchan writes what she feels.
('87', 346, 5, 10, 508569) I think it is necessary that she should be satisfied.
('87', 346, 5, 11, 508623) How can she be forced against her will?
('87', 346, 5, 12, 508663) But I doubt very much if you two can stay together in the Ashram.
('87', 346, 5, 13, 508729) It seems to me impossible that you may stay in a house of your own in the Ashram and still refrain from sexual gratification.
('87', 346, 5, 14, 508855) Kanchan at any rate will not be able to do so.
('87', 346, 5, 15, 508902) And, knowing you as I do, I can say that you also will not be able to do so.
('87', 346, 5, 16, 508979) Ramprasad is not an Ashram inmate.
('87', 346, 5, 17, 509014) He is a paid worker and runs a separate kitchen of his own.
('87', 346, 5, 18, 509074) Even so, I am not reconciled to their gratification of physical desire.
('87', 346, 5, 19, 509146) But having engaged him I am help less.
('87', 346, 5, 20, 509185) His case, like Niyamat’s, should not be cited as a precedent.

('87', 354, 13, 24, 519237) Only then can it do good.
('87', 354, 13, 25, 519263) That was my view about the management.
('87', 354, 13, 26, 519302) Since I am not aware of everything, the final decision should be taken by those who know

('87', 355, 5, 6, 519553) August 13, 1945
('87', 355, 6, 7, 519569) PARNERKAR, If the manure was lying there because of paucity of labour you should have taken help from the Ashram inmates.
('87', 355, 6, 8, 519691) You will remember you have asked for such help before.
('87', 355, 6, 9, 519746) There was no point in shifting itfrom one place to another.
('87', 355, 6, 10, 519806) It can be used for vegetables; but the question is whether it is more useful for the fruit trees or for the vegetables.
('87', 355, 6, 11, 519926) I felt that your reply was not straight.
('87', 355, 6, 12, 519967) If we have been negligent it is our duty to own it.
('87', 355, 6, 13, 520019) (2) I will myself see about the trees.
('87', 355, 6, 14, 520058) (3) I shall be pleased if Shri Patil and his sister in law live in the Ashram and work in the Goshala.
('87', 355, 6, 15, 520161) But have a talk with Munnalalji and write to Patil what he says.
('87', 355, 6, 16, 520226) (4) I will certainly like it if Ramnarayan can stay in the Goshala.
('87', 355, 6, 17, 520294) Ask him whether he wishes to stay or not.
('87', 355, 6, 18, 520336) I was under the impression that at the moment it is not possible to accommodate him under any circumstances.
('87', 355, 6, 19, 520445) (5) Does the Hindustani Talimi Sangh want developed land?
('87', 355, 6, 20, 520503) I thought it was otherwise.
('87', 355, 6, 21, 520531) We must give the land.
('87', 355, 6, 22, 520554) Put down everything in Writing and let me know.
('87', 355, 6, 23, 520602) Let them have it on a nominal rent, for a specific period.
('87', 355, 6, 24, 520661) Give them the right to return the land.
('87', 355, 6, 25, 520701) I think I have replied to all your questions.

('87', 356, 2, 3, 520959) Now you can talk.
('87', 356, 2, 4, 520977) I shall talk if I have to reply.
('87', 356, 2, 5, 521010) The question is not about.
('87', 356, 2, 6, 521037) 2 at Wardha.
('87', 356, 2, 7, 521050) The question is what is proper for you.
('87', 356, 2, 8, 521090) I have not laid down any condition.
('87', 356, 2, 9, 521126) If you Say it is something new, then you may leave it.
('87', 356, 2, 10, 521181) You are not a little girl, nor are you an ordinary woman.
('87', 356, 2, 11, 521239) You are a worker of some standing.
('87', 356, 2, 12, 521274) Tendulkar is an experienced man.
('87', 356, 2, 13, 521307) I might join you two in wedlock only to see you lost in family life.
('87', 356, 2, 14, 521376) Read my letter 3 again; you will not find in it any condition, only a keendesire on my part.
('87', 356, 2, 15, 521469) If you have already decided to lead family life, what is the use of going through an Ashram wedding?
('87', 356, 2, 16, 521570) You do not know the amount of pains I am taking and how much I am thinking about it.
('87', 356, 2, 17, 521655) In my opinion this is no small matter.
('87', 356, 2, 18, 521694) Know that I had expressed the same desire in the case of every other wedding.
('87', 356, 2, 19, 521772) But they were all young girls with the exception of Saundaram.
('87', 356, 2, 20, 521835) You on the other hand ought to raise more important questions.
('87', 356, 2, 21, 521898) How will it look if you desired progeny before the coming of independence?
('87', 356, 2, 22, 521973) I shall not forbid you from inviting those people if you wish.
('87', 356, 2, 23, 522036) Will they have to be served a meal here?
('87', 356, 2, 24, 522077) Tell me after thinking over it.
('87', 356, 2, 25, 522109) Show me my letter.
('87', 356, 2, 26, 522128) Does my language imply a condition?
('87', 356, 4, 27, 522164) This is a different matter.
('87', 356, 4, 28, 522192) When you say that I laid down a condition which was not there earlier, I maintain that I have stipulated no such condition.
('87', 356, 4, 29, 522316) This is why I made the inquiry.
('87', 356, 4, 30, 522348) I can do something only on the assumption that neither of you will be a hypocrite.
('87', 356, 4, 31, 522431) In the event of hypocrisy I shall not be losing anything; only you two will stand to lose.
('87', 356, 4, 32, 522522) This has been my experience to date.
('87', 356, 4, 33, 522559) Those who betrayed me have ultimately fallen.

('87', 357, 6, 11, 523273) [Before August 14, 1945] 2
('87', 357, 7, 12, 523300) I can give you advice only as from one individual to another.
('87', 357, 7, 13, 523362) I am not giving any advice to the Harijan Sevak Sangh which is an institution.
('87', 357, 7, 14, 523441) After all the Harijan Sevak Sangh is only as good as the best men in it and I know how few they are.
('87', 357, 7, 15, 523542) The Sangh has done substantial work, though not in the estimation of the Harijans or in the estimation of the orthodox Hindus.
('87', 357, 7, 16, 523669) The Harijans may want to smash the caste Hindus and the caste Hindus may want to cling to the old way.
('87', 357, 7, 17, 523772) The Sangh has to face both these.
('87', 357, 7, 18, 523806) You have asked me how the Sangh can be revitalized.
('87', 357, 7, 19, 523858) I know the royal way is a fast by me.
('87', 357, 7, 20, 523896) I might fast again and that more readily for Harijans than for anything else.
('87', 357, 7, 21, 523974) But I must wait till God asks me to do it.
('87', 357, 7, 22, 524017) There is no such thing as a forced fast.
('87', 357, 7, 23, 524058) It has to come and I cannot say now when it will come.
('87', 357, 7, 24, 524113) I must also tell you that there are others who want to fast for the Harijans.
('87', 357, 7, 25, 524191) But I have told them that they are not to fast while I am alive.
('87', 357, 7, 26, 524256) I have also the idea of a chain of fasts.
('87', 357, 7, 27, 524298) In such a chain I will fast first and then when my body has perished, the next fast will begin and it will go on till untouchability is no more.
('87', 357, 7, 28, 524443) Such a fast is conceived, but it cannot be taken up at once as I said it has to come.
('87', 357, 7, 29, 524529) But before even such a thing happens a lot of spade work has to be done.
('87', 357, 7, 30, 524602) That is why Harijan Sevak Sangh workers are
('87', 357, 8, 31, 524646) 1Who had sought Gandhiji’s advice on the various problems of Harijans 2From the reference to the Harijan Sevak Sangh workers’ meeting which was held on August 14, 1945. Vide also “Letter to Sudhir Ghosh”, 28 8 1945.
('87', 358, 0, 1, 524862) VOL. 87 : 29 MAY, 1945 29 AUGUST, 1945 359
('87', 358, 1, 2, 524905) meeting here soon.
('87', 358, 1, 3, 524924) They are meeting for the very purpose of revitalizing the Sangh’s work.
('87', 358, 1, 4, 524996) The present feeling among the Harijan Sevak Sangh workers is that practically nothing has been done among caste Hindus.
('87', 358, 1, 5, 525116) Education of Harijans is one thing; education of Savarnas is another and as I know more difficult.
('87', 358, 1, 6, 525215) You can educate Harijans by giving them scholarships, hostels, etc., but no such way is possible among the caste Hindus.
('87', 358, 1, 7, 525336) The task, therefore, is to educate the savarnas.
('87', 358, 1, 8, 525385) But this can be done only by those who are fired by a living faith in the Hinduism which I understand.
('87', 358, 1, 9, 525488) Only those who fully know the meaningof Hinduism as I know it can perform the miracle.
('87', 358, 1, 10, 525575) Let us not forget that untouchability is a most difficult thing to remove and that our task is a heavy one.
('87', 358, 1, 11, 525683) But I have no doubt that God will remove untou chability or remove Hinduism.
('87', 358, 1, 12, 525760) Now in regard to your question on the political future of Harijans, I certainly see that those Harijans who have become poli tically conscious should straightaway have a full opportunity to figure in politics.
('87', 358, 1, 13, 525970) You have asked me what I mean by saying that I want such Harijans to be more than a match for all other political competitors.
('87', 358, 1, 14, 526097) Many people weigh the Harijans in some special Harijan balance.
('87', 358, 1, 15, 526161) But I want to weigh the Harijans in the same balance in which I weigh the best.
('87', 358, 1, 16, 526241) You have to outweigh others because you have to cover so much lost distance.
('87', 358, 1, 17, 526318) That is why I expect from the Harijans greater effort than from others.
('87', 358, 1, 18, 526390) You have asked me whether Dr. Ambedkar has in my opinion thus proved himself to be more than a match.
('87', 358, 1, 19, 526492) My answer is ‘Yes’ and ‘No’.
('87', 358, 1, 20, 526521) Dr. Ambedkar is a fierce and fearless man.
('87', 358, 1, 21, 526564) He does not scruple to beat the Hindu dog with any stick he can get.
('87', 358, 1, 22, 526633) He wants to destroy Hinduism.
('87', 358, 1, 23, 526663) It is open to him to do it.
('87', 358, 1, 24, 526691) If the Harijans want to do it they can do it.
('87', 358, 1, 25, 526737) Then the Harijans must become the destroyers of Hinduism.
('87', 358, 1, 26, 526795) I want Harijans to become as able and earnest as Dr. Ambedkar but in a different way.
('87', 358, 1, 27, 526881) I want you to do even better.
('87', 358, 1, 28, 526911) I want you to produce sterling men who will reshape the whole of our society.
('87', 358, 1, 29, 526989) It is not enough to be educated.
('87', 358, 1, 30, 527022) It is necessary to be cultured and fearless.
('87', 358, 1, 31, 527067) Such men who will reshape society will have to work among the people and not cut themselves away from the people.
('87', 358, 1, 32, 527181) They will have to be stern, incorruptible and self reliant.
('87', 358, 1, 33, 527241) There is nothing to prevent such people from taking any assistance from clean quarters.
('87', 358, 1, 34, 527329) But my point is the more you lean on such assistance, the more difficult becomes the task of uplifting the Harijans.

('87', 364, 7, 16, 532291) WARDHA, August 14, 1945
('87', 364, 8, 17, 532315) Gandhiji said that only caste Hindus and no Harijan should be taken on the Executive of the Sangh, as it was the caste Hindus who had to atone for their sin of prolonging untouchability.
('87', 364, 8, 18, 532502) Harijans could be members of the supervision committee that might be set up for carrying on the work properly.
('87', 364, 9, 19, 532613) Replying to a question, Gandhiji said that he would appreciate the principle of satyagraha for enforcing the civic rights of Harijans in public places like tanks, wells, temples, etc.
('87', 364, 9, 20, 532797) He, however, emphasized that the Harijan Sevak Sangh as an organization should not be involved in such a satyagraha.
('87', 364, 9, 21, 532914) Individual Harijan workers might try that remedy with the help of others.
('87', 364, 10, 22, 532988) Gandhiji explained to the members how Harijan work was to be carried on.
('87', 364, 10, 23, 533061) Persistent propaganda for changing the hearts of the orthodox and caste Hindus, hesaid, would greatly help to solve the problem of untouchability which was a stigma on Hinduism.
('87', 364, 11, 24, 533239) To create confidence among Harijans, Mahatma Gandhi went on, Harijan workers had to live amidst Harijans, mix with them, study their local and other

('87', 365, 1, 3, 533628) The workers should live like the Harijans “so that they can feel that you are one of them”.
('87', 365, 2, 4, 533720) Gandhiji emphasized the need for more intensive work for the uplift of Harijans and called for more workers.
('87', 365, 2, 5, 533829) It was a very vast work and needed great patience, energy, time and money, he said.

('87', 365, 5, 10, 534079) I tlnink it should not be published.
('87', 365, 5, 11, 534116) Writing fully.” I do not infer from your letter that you are writing about my ‘Hindus’.
('87', 365, 5, 12, 534204) Whatever you have in your heart has not come in your writing.
('87', 365, 5, 13, 534266) But do not worry about it.

('87', 365, 5, 15, 534350) Whatever you want to say about the communal problem should not be said without consulting the Working Committee.
('87', 365, 5, 16, 534463) I am also of the opinion that it would be better to be quiet.
('87', 365, 5, 17, 534525) The party can give its opinion after consultation with you.
('87', 365, 5, 18, 534585) They have a right to do so.
('87', 365, 5, 19, 534613) Besides it is their duty.
('87', 365, 5, 20, 534639) I differ from your opinion.
('87', 365, 5, 21, 534667) I can not say if I attach importance to the words ‘Hindu’ and ‘Mussalman’.
('87', 365, 5, 22, 534742) Whatever the Congress does is a different thing.
('87', 365, 5, 23, 534791) At one time I do not like ‘Hindu’ and at another time I do not like ‘Mussalman’.
('87', 365, 5, 24, 534872) It means there cannot be either.
('87', 365, 5, 25, 534905) All this needs pondering over.

('87', 366, 3, 6, 535826) What you say is perfectly correct.

('87', 366, 8, 21, 536449) VINOBA, I do not believe that agriculture alone will bring self reliance.
('87', 366, 8, 22, 536523) We should become self reliant through the handicrafts we take up.
('87', 366, 8, 23, 536589) I grant that in the very first year we cannot become self reliant.
('87', 366, 8, 24, 536656) However, when we complete the entire process the expenditure and the income should balance.
('87', 366, 8, 25, 536748) I would not call agriculture a handicraft.
('87', 366, 8, 26, 536791) But it is an occupation of crores of people.
('87', 366, 8, 27, 536836) It does not encourage skill but it does give a lot of physical exercise.
('87', 366, 8, 28, 536909) It has been accorded its rightful place after seven years.
('87', 366, 8, 29, 536968) It is a sad thing that we have been divided into two groups but that is inevitable.
('87', 366, 8, 30, 537052) We regard constructive work as a symbol of ahimsa while others look upon it as a means of furthering their work.
('87', 366, 8, 31, 537165) And that only to the extent that if they can do without itthey will do so.

('87', 367, 6, 15, 537839) I am sending your letters to Agatha Harrison and Krishna Menon, by air mail.
('87', 367, 6, 16, 537916) I see from these that all those sentenced to death are classed as political prisoners.
('87', 367, 6, 17, 538003) Can this view sustain?
('87', 367, 6, 18, 538026) During the upheaval a few criminals indulged in foul deeds.
('87', 367, 6, 19, 538086) Can they be described as political?
('87', 367, 6, 20, 538122) Then what the Huns did in Sind should similarly be described as political.
('87', 367, 6, 21, 538197) All these things are weighing on my mind.
('87', 367, 6, 22, 538239) Even so I do not hold back your letter, because I have not been given any choice and it is addressed to Agatha Harrison.
('87', 367, 6, 23, 538360) The second letter you have forgotten to sign.
('87', 367, 6, 24, 538406) However, I am forwarding it to Krishna Menon.
('87', 367, 6, 25, 538452) The truth is that capital punishment is bad in itself and it should be abolished.
('87', 367, 6, 26, 538534) I have no hope of anything good coming out of it.
('87', 367, 6, 27, 538584) We must understand the system.
('87', 367, 6, 28, 538615) The Viceroy wields supreme power.
('87', 367, 6, 29, 538649) So if we are not able to achieve anything here we might as well wash our hands of the whole thing.
('87', 367, 6, 30, 538748) They cannot run the administration in any other way.
('87', 367, 6, 31, 538801) We should therefore do whatever is possible only here.
('87', 367, 6, 32, 538856) Our last resort is public opinion.
('87', 367, 6, 33, 538891) Public opinion, in this matter, is evidently not able to do much and when it does achieve something it is not as effective as it should be.
('87', 367, 6, 34, 539031) I have stated what can be done about Mahendra Chowdhary after the execution.

('87', 369, 5, 16, 541364) August 16, 1945
('87', 369, 6, 17, 541380) NARANDAS, I sent you today a wire as follows: “All agree cotton condition beneficial end.
('87', 369, 6, 18, 541470) Writing—Bapu.” 2 If I could have written to you on the very day that I received your letter, this letter would have reached you at the same time as the wire.
('87', 369, 6, 19, 541628) But I did not wish to reply to your letter without showing it to others.
('87', 369, 6, 20, 541701) For, though I had written a long letter to you, you remained convinced in your mind regarding your demand.
('87', 369, 6, 21, 541808) I did not, therefore, think it proper to write to you on my own.
('87', 369, 6, 22, 541873) Yourletter has now been read by Jajuji, Chhaganlal 3, Krishnadas 4 and

('87', 370, 1, 2, 542100) Kan aiyo.
('87', 370, 1, 3, 542110) They all agree with me.
('87', 370, 1, 4, 542134) Jajuji has even written down his view.
('87', 370, 1, 5, 542173) I send it with this.
('87', 370, 1, 6, 542194) He has described his own experience.
('87', 370, 1, 7, 542231) I am confident that a person like you is bound to have the same experience.
('87', 370, 1, 8, 542307) “Swaraj will be gained through yarn,” I said, relying on intuition.
('87', 370, 1, 9, 542375) But I realize now that intuition is one thing and its confirmation by experience another.
('87', 370, 1, 10, 542465) And what I have been putting forward now is something different still.
('87', 370, 1, 11, 542536) Others are having more convincing experience of the same.
('87', 370, 1, 12, 542594) It is not going to impress me at all even if in Kathiawar khadi worth Rs. 4 lakhs instead of Rs. 2 lakhs is produced and sold.
('87', 370, 1, 13, 542721) For it could be proved that such production and sale of khadi would only promote the welfare of the poor, and an all India institution like the Charkha Sangh need not be established merely for that purpose.
('87', 370, 1, 14, 542928) A co operative of the poor for producing khadi could be established and more khadi at still lower cost could be produced.
('87', 370, 1, 15, 543050) But even then that khadi would be of value only as khadi for the poor.
('87', 370, 1, 16, 543121) It would, one may say, make no contribution to the cause of swaraj.
('87', 370, 1, 17, 543189) I, therefore, desire that you should have perfect self confidence and adopt this new method—policy—for khadi and discover from experience that it is khadi for swaraj.
('87', 370, 1, 18, 543356) It is quite possible that Kathiawar may not accept such khadi.
('87', 370, 1, 19, 543419) If so, don’t mind if no khadi work is done there, for you must be aware that no such work is done in many Indian States.
('87', 370, 1, 20, 543540) In the same way if no work is done in Kathiawar, either, the cause of khadi for swaraj would not suffer.
('87', 370, 1, 21, 543645) I go even further and say that in carrying on khadi activity for swaraj, if it ceases to be khadi for the poor, the latter are not going to lose anything for they will be able to earn their bread in some other way.
('87', 370, 1, 22, 543860) But if khadi supports the poor even while remaining khadi for the swaraj, it would be a credit both to the poor and the cause of swaraj.
('87', 370, 1, 23, 543997) The poor thereby would have contributed to the winning of swaraj.
('87', 370, 1, 24, 544063) If I have left any point unexplained, Kanaiyo will explain it when he arrives there.
('87', 370, 1, 25, 544148) I hope your health is perfect.
('87', 370, 1, 26, 544179) If you can leave that place, it might be better for you to come and see me once.

('87', 371, 2, 3, 544448) August 16, 1945
('87', 371, 3, 4, 544464) BHAI LAKSHMI BABU, We cannot accept even one of the three conditions.
('87', 371, 3, 5, 544534) 1 Even though we believe that it is an inflammatory speech, constructive activity has no relation at all with movements such as that of 1942. Even if we denounce the violent activities of Shri Jayaprakash Narayan, we cannot accept any of these three conditions, that is to say, we cannot compel the workers to respect them.
('87', 371, 3, 6, 544858) If the independence of India is common cause between us and the Government then what is the meaning of all these differences?
('87', 371, 3, 7, 544984) The truth is that the Bihar Government has made a mistake in making the arrests but instead of acknowledging the mistake it wants to put the responsibility on us.
('87', 371, 3, 8, 545147) We will not accept the responsibility even if they should wipe us out.
('87', 371, 3, 9, 545218) Let them stop our peaceful activities.
('87', 371, 3, 10, 545257) We shall still go forward.

('87', 371, 8, 16, 545409) BHAI PROFULLA BABU, I have your two letters: one about Labanya Kumar and the other about my going there.
('87', 371, 8, 17, 545514) I have met Labanya Kumar and have written about the engineers.
('87', 371, 8, 18, 545577) He has also seen things here.
('87', 371, 8, 19, 545607) Now about my visit.
('87', 371, 8, 20, 545627) I have said I will go.
('87', 371, 8, 21, 545650) I have also been told by the Governor that the way is open for my visit.
('87', 371, 8, 22, 545723) The question now is when I should go.
('87', 371, 8, 23, 545761) I cannot go before October under any circumstances and as regards October you frighten me.
('87', 371, 8, 24, 545852) I personally am not frightened but if I am not to go in October it will be very late.
('87', 371, 9, 25, 545938) 1 The addressee had written that the Governor of Bihar in his talk with Anugraha Narayan Sinha had said that: (i) The Government would not allow the constructive workers to make any inflammatory speeches.
('87', 371, 9, 26, 546143) (ii) The Government would not give any opportunity to the Constructive workers to launch a mass movement as that of 1942. (iii) The Government would keep a close watch on the activities of the Congress as none of its members, including Gandhiji, denounced the violent activities of Jayaprakash Narayan.

('87', 372, 1, 2, 546489) So write to me after considering everything.
('87', 372, 1, 3, 546534) As you must be aware, I have stayed in Calcutta in October and have moved about.
('87', 372, 1, 4, 546615) Besides, I ask myself why I cannot stay in a place where you all can.
('87', 372, 1, 5, 546685) I will advise you to see Satis Babu also in this connection.
('87', 372, 1, 6, 546746) I know it is a tricky matter, but we should be able to do something.
('87', 372, 1, 7, 546815) In Calcutta I shall stay in Sodepur.
('87', 372, 1, 8, 546852) I know Sarat Babu 1 would insist that I should stay with him.
('87', 372, 1, 9, 546914) You should jointly decide and let me know.
('87', 372, 1, 10, 546957) I am not going there for a fixed period.
('87', 372, 1, 11, 546998) I want to lose myself in the misery of Bengal.
('87', 372, 1, 12, 547045) I want to go to Midnapore and also to Chittagong.
('87', 372, 1, 13, 547095) I do not know how far the body will carry.
('87', 372, 1, 14, 547138) Also I shall not be able to put up with undisciplined crowds and constant noise.
('87', 372, 1, 15, 547219) Do not go on saying ‘yes’ to everybody.
('87', 372, 1, 16, 547259) Meet the persons whom you have to meet and let me know.
('87', 372, 1, 17, 547315) Meet Sudhir Ghosh also.
('87', 372, 1, 18, 547339) I have come to know him quite well and he has something to do with my going there.
('87', 372, 1, 19, 547422) He works with the Tatas.

('87', 372, 5, 24, 547586) It certainly is.
('87', 372, 5, 25, 547603) 3 But I learnt the fact only today.
('87', 372, 5, 26, 547639) I did know about his marriage in Germany.
('87', 372, 5, 27, 547681) But, though married, he had become as good as one not married.
('87', 372, 5, 28, 547744) That he is going to marry for the third time, I learnt only now and from you.
('87', 372, 5, 29, 547822) You told Abha and she told me.
('87', 372, 5, 30, 547853) Nevertheless I attach great value to a promise and, therefore, for the sake of the promise, this knowledge notwithstanding, I will get them married.
('87', 372, 5, 31, 548002) However, I do realize from this case that one should make no promises.
('87', 372, 5, 32, 548073) But this is like inquiring about a man’s caste after drinking water at his place.
('87', 372, 5, 33, 548155) But do we not have the other saying, too, that it is morning whenever one wakes up?

('87', 373, 2, 4, 548716) August 18, 1945
('87', 373, 3, 5, 548732) DEAR TENDULKAR, Many are protesting to me that I am officiating at your marriage tomorrow.
('87', 373, 3, 6, 548823) Among them are Manilal and now his wife.
('87', 373, 3, 7, 548864) She tells me that this will be your third marriage, though I believe in one man one wife and vice versa for all time.
('87', 373, 3, 8, 548982) I know about your new German wife but nothing about your previous wife.
('87', 373, 3, 9, 549054) My son says none of my ideals will be realized in this union and that neither you nor Indu will carry out my wish that you may not procreate during the country’s dependence.
('87', 373, 3, 10, 549228) I have told them that I cannot go back on my promise which is not in itself immoral or not for a manifestly immoralpurpose.
('87', 373, 3, 11, 549352) Therefore the promise shall be fulfilled (D. V.,).
('87', 373, 3, 12, 549403) But you will please give me such answer as you can.
('87', 373, 3, 13, 549455) Now for your preparation for tomorrow: (1) Both should fast till the marriage tie is formed, fruits may be taken.
('87', 373, 3, 14, 549569) (2) You will both read 12th Chapter of Gita and contemplate its meaning.
('87', 373, 3, 15, 549642) (3) Each will clean up separate plots of ground with measure.
('87', 373, 3, 16, 549704) (4) Each will tend cows in the Goshala.
('87', 373, 3, 17, 549744) (5) Each will clean up the well side.
('87', 373, 3, 18, 549782) (6) Each will clean a closet well.
('87', 373, 3, 19, 549817) (7) Each will spin daily and do all these with the intention so far as possible of carrying out these yajnas daily.

('87', 373, 6, 21, 549995) 636. YARN DONATION
('87', 373, 7, 22, 550014) We all know that Shri Narandas Gandhi is a dedicated votary of khadi.
('87', 373, 7, 23, 550084) He has such great faith in khadi that he sees Daridranarayana in it.
('87', 373, 7, 24, 550153) He therefore spins for many hours a day.
('87', 373, 7, 25, 550194) He has also given a prominent place to spinning in the national school conducted by him at Rajkot.
('87', 373, 7, 26, 550293) For the last many years he has been collecting both yarn and money for the “Charkha Dwadashi’’ 1. This time he has carried

('87', 374, 0, 1, 550470) VOL. 87 : 29 MAY, 1945 29 AUGUST, 1945 375
('87', 374, 1, 2, 550513) the sutra yajna a long way and he has expressed his wish to the country that not only spinning but donating of yarn should catch on.
('87', 374, 1, 3, 550646) Everyone can participate in it.
('87', 374, 1, 4, 550678) It should be borne in mind that he does not insist that the yarn should be donated to him only.
('87', 374, 1, 5, 550774) It can be given to All India Spinners’ Association as well.
('87', 374, 1, 6, 550834) What he wants is that people should now give yarn donations freely and that he should be supplied with figures as to the quantity of yarn spun all over India and the quantity of yarn donated.
('87', 374, 1, 7, 551026) To provide information to the public it is enough if these figures are sent to the All India Spinners’ Asso ciation office.
('87', 374, 1, 8, 551150) However, the activity will gain impetus if figures are sent to the person who has conceived the idea, has struggled for it and has fostered the activity.
('87', 374, 1, 9, 551304) If the figures are sent to him, he will have a clear picture of the work done and his planning and knowledge will prove very useful to all for further progress of work.
('87', 374, 1, 10, 551473) Every year he seeks my consent for whatever work he does.
('87', 374, 1, 11, 551531) This year I thought it proper to accept only yarn donations and suggested it to him accordingly.
('87', 374, 1, 12, 551628) I have visualized yarn currency and have called Chi.
('87', 374, 1, 13, 551681) Narandas its banker.
('87', 374, 1, 14, 551702) I believe that he has the right ability and purity for that kind of work.
('87', 374, 1, 15, 551776) It is possible that at present the yarn will not fulfil all the requirements of the currency.
('87', 374, 1, 16, 551870) But our aim today is to increase the number of spinners from the standpoint of non violent swaraj.
('87', 374, 1, 17, 551969) An experiment to make yarn a currency was made locally at Nalwadi.
('87', 374, 1, 18, 552036) Another experiment is going on in Bezwada.
('87', 374, 1, 19, 552079) However the ideas behind the two experiments were different.
('87', 374, 1, 20, 552140) The experiment can be extended to cover the whole of India.
('87', 374, 1, 21, 552200) Only one year will be required for such currency to come into force.
('87', 374, 1, 22, 552269) Every home will then become a mint.
('87', 374, 1, 23, 552305) But it is only an idea today.
('87', 374, 1, 24, 552335) For the time being all the spinners will produce currency in the form of yarn and will give that away in donation.
('87', 374, 1, 25, 552450) Every branch of the All India Spinners’ Associa tion will collect such donations.
('87', 374, 1, 26, 552532) The yarn will belong to the All India Spinners’ Association.
('87', 374, 1, 27, 552593) Only the account will be sent to Chi.
('87', 374, 1, 28, 552631) Narandas.
('87', 374, 1, 29, 552641) The ownership will be that of the All India Spinners’ Association.
('87', 374, 1, 30, 552708) Narandas will be the custodian of the yarn sent to him directly or collected by himself.
('87', 374, 1, 31, 552797) It will be utilized and distributed with my permi ssion.
('87', 374, 1, 32, 552854) The money and the yarn collected by Chi.
('87', 374, 1, 33, 552895) Narandas every year is distributed with my permission.
('87', 374, 1, 34, 552950) It will be the same this year also.
('87', 374, 1, 35, 552986) This year the idea of cash collection has been given up.
('87', 374, 1, 36, 553043) However, cash will be received from those who want to give it but the
('87', 375, 0, 1, 553113) 376 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('87', 375, 1, 2, 553155) All India Spinner’s Association will not make any arrangement for its collection.
('87', 375, 1, 3, 553237) The same rule applies to Chi.
('87', 375, 1, 4, 553267) Narandas.
('87', 375, 1, 5, 553277) The aim will be to collect only yarn donations.
('87', 375, 1, 6, 553325) Whatever yarn the All India Spinners’ Association collects will be its capital.
('87', 375, 1, 7, 553405) From now on it will not collect cash for carrying on its activities but will manage with yarn only.
('87', 375, 1, 8, 553505) The yarn thus collected will not be sold.
('87', 375, 1, 9, 553547) But the khadi made from it will be sold.
('87', 375, 1, 10, 553588) Yarn will be taken but not given.
('87', 375, 1, 11, 553622) Only the things made from it will be given and sold.
('87', 375, 1, 12, 553675) The rule already exists of taking a certain amount of yarn when selling khadi but at some places the practice has been started of giving khadi in exchange for the full quantity of yarn.
('87', 375, 1, 13, 553861) In spite of that the effort will be to have only yarn donations on the occasion ofCharkha Jayanti.
('87', 375, 1, 14, 553960) However, I want that besides khadi other articles of village industries should be made available in exchange for yarn.
('87', 375, 1, 15, 554079) But that can be realized only when we take the final step.
('87', 375, 1, 16, 554138) At the moment I have presented the idea of yarn currency only in its initial form.
('87', 375, 1, 17, 554221) It is easy for accounting and the capital of yarn increases not by interest but by the labour of the spinner.
('87', 375, 1, 18, 554331) If the people understand this scheme then yarn will become an instrument for the production of goods worth crores of rupees.
('87', 375, 1, 19, 554456) Physical labour will become the capital and will easily be able to compete with capitalists.

('87', 376, 2, 3, 554691) SEVAGRAM, August 18, 1945
('87', 376, 3, 4, 554717) VINOBA, .
('87', 376, 3, 5, 554727) I shall look into the Nayee Talim matter.
('87', 376, 3, 6, 554769) Ashadevi is not here at present.
('87', 376, 3, 7, 554802) I have not a full copy of the Ramayana as abridged by me but I send you a marked copy of the Ramayana from which you will be able to know the principles on which I had worked.
('87', 376, 3, 8, 554978) As far as possible I have tried to retain the historical or narrative portion unbroken.
('87', 376, 3, 9, 555066) Some of the interpolations are useful by themselves, but still I have dropped them altogether.
('87', 376, 3, 10, 555161) I have also dropped any matter which had been over lengthened as also such portions as appeared to me unnecessary for the narrative.
('87', 376, 3, 11, 555294) I have also generally removed portions where woman is referred to in derogatory terms.
('87', 376, 3, 12, 555381) But I have kept some portions of it just to indicate the mind of Tulsidas.
('87', 376, 3, 13, 555456) So far as I can remember at the moment, these are the principles I worked upon.
('87', 376, 3, 14, 555536) But you are intelligent enough to discover any other principle not mentioned here from the marks in the book.
('87', 376, 3, 15, 555646) Failure has compelled me to do what I was not prepared to do by persuasion.
('87', 376, 3, 16, 555722) I mean that I have commenced from yesterday therecitation of Gitai 2 in place of the Sanskrit Gita.
('87', 376, 3, 17, 555822) I realized that nobody learnt Sanskrit.
('87', 376, 3, 18, 555862) The same old members are there, but even they do not or are unable to study Sanskrit even to the extent of understanding the Gita.
('87', 376, 3, 19, 555993) Moreover, they were unable to recite it in chorus, and what pained me more was the fact that though the recitation of the whole of the Gita was confined to the morning prayer, still some members walked out as soon as the recitation began.
('87', 376, 3, 20, 556232) On making an enquiry into the cause of this, I found that it was very trivial.
('87', 376, 3, 21, 556311) I did not know it before.
('87', 376, 3, 22, 556337) I found it out only the day before yesterday, and I immediately came to the conclusion that perhaps interest in the Gita might be created more quickly if it was recited in Hindi, Marathi or Gujarati since the people would understand its
('87', 376, 4, 23, 556574) 1 K. G. Mashruwala, while publishing the letter in Harijan, withheld the first portion of it as not being “absolutely relevant to the present discussion”.
('87', 376, 4, 24, 556729) The original letter in Gujarati is not available.
('87', 376, 4, 25, 556779) 2 Metrical rendering of the Gita in Marathi by the addressee, literally, ‘Gita the Mother’.
('87', 377, 0, 1, 556871) 378 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('87', 377, 1, 2, 556913) meaning more easily.
('87', 377, 1, 3, 556934) I have commenced with Gitai because Marathi holds the place of prominence in this part.
('87', 377, 1, 4, 557022) So far as the members attending the morning prayer are concerned, they are so few that it would not matter much which language I chose.
('87', 377, 1, 5, 557158) But the music of Gitai has been felt by me to be very sweet.
('87', 377, 1, 6, 557219) Maybe, the reason for this is that I have heard it several times recited by Shivaji 1 and I have liked it.
('87', 377, 1, 7, 557326) Kishorelal’s (Gujarati) translation is there but I have not yet been able to assimilate its music.
('87', 377, 1, 8, 557425) I have not heard anyone reciting it in a sweet tone.
('87', 377, 1, 9, 557478) I got an opportunity of hearing it at Bardoli but it was insufficient, and my ear could not adapt itself to it.
('87', 377, 1, 10, 557590) Haribhau 2 has published the Hindi Gita recently.
('87', 377, 1, 11, 557640) But I have not yet been able even to examine it and so did not like to touch it.
('87', 377, 1, 12, 557721) Therefore, I have commenced with Gitai.
('87', 377, 1, 13, 557761) The immediate cause for writing this is that I happened to see Shivaji yesterday.
('87', 377, 1, 14, 557843) If he is going to stay here for some time, it would please me if he can be induced to give at least a week to the Ashram just now during the period of the commencement of this recitation.
('87', 377, 1, 15, 558031) He can train those who desire in reciting it in the same manner as he does, and pick up his music.

('87', 378, 12, 19, 559277) I have been telling her that if at all she is inclined she should go ahead and marry Vrajlal, and bring you peace.
('87', 378, 12, 20, 559392) But she is firm.
('87', 378, 12, 21, 559409) She certainly has respect for you.
('87', 378, 12, 22, 559444) I am sure she will not tarnish your name.
('87', 378, 12, 23, 559486) She will bring credit to you if she remains firm in her resolve and at the same time merges herself in God.
('87', 378, 12, 24, 559594) I would advise you to encourage her to stick to her decision.

('87', 379, 2, 3, 560022) August 19, 1945
('87', 379, 3, 4, 560038) MUNNALAL, 1. Kanchan does desire sexual pleasure.
('87', 379, 3, 5, 560088) You also have the desire.
('87', 379, 3, 6, 560114) It would not be anything strange if you lived together and satisfied your desire.
('87', 379, 3, 7, 560196) Self suppression is not going to help.
('87', 379, 3, 8, 560235) Hence do what you feel is natural for you.
('87', 379, 3, 9, 560278) Thwarting Kanchan’s desire will harm her.
('87', 379, 3, 10, 560320) She is good and has the spirit of service.
('87', 379, 3, 11, 560363) She will lose both these things in the end.
('87', 379, 3, 12, 560407) 2. Let Hiramani go on as she is doing till Ashadevi arrives.
('87', 379, 3, 13, 560468) 3. Read Parnerkar’s letter and have a talk with him.
('87', 379, 3, 14, 560521) About the farm, too, do what is necessary.
('87', 379, 3, 15, 560564) Take Kishorelal’s help.
('87', 379, 3, 16, 560588) 4. About Krishnachandra you will have to think.
('87', 379, 3, 17, 560636) Talk with him frankly and with love regarding his habit of eating and about other matters, too.
('87', 379, 3, 18, 560732) You should think about your temperamental differences.
('87', 379, 3, 19, 560787) 5. Let the yarn spun by me be handed over to the Ashram.
('87', 379, 3, 20, 560844) Get that much quantity spun by me when I arrive there.
('87', 379, 3, 21, 560899) If the other people spin from the Ashram cotton, the yarn should be credited to the Ashram.
('87', 379, 3, 22, 560991) What we spin is of course for the Ashram.
('87', 379, 3, 23, 561033) 6. Whenever you wish to ask me anything about the women, you may do so.
('87', 379, 3, 24, 561105) 7. You will be able to improve your singing with effort.
('87', 379, 3, 25, 561162) If you have no time for that, you need not join in the singing at all.
('87', 379, 3, 26, 561233) 8. Run classes for the Gitai and nothing else.
('87', 379, 3, 27, 561280) 9. About the expenses here, it is all right that you have bought the ticket.
('87', 379, 3, 28, 561357) I will not be able to judge better in this matter.
('87', 379, 3, 29, 561408) 10. Sankaranji may, if he wishes, cook his own meals if he cannot keep good health otherwise.
('87', 379, 3, 30, 561502) 11. Ramachandran is there only for a short period.
('87', 379, 3, 31, 561553) 12. The library books can be kept together.

('87', 381, 4, 9, 563453) 646. HOW TO DO IT?
('87', 381, 5, 10, 563472) The A. I. V. I. A. has not shown the results it might have.
('87', 381, 5, 11, 563532) I have often asked myself that question.
('87', 381, 5, 12, 563573) I try now and here to think aloud and confer with the workers to see what can be done.
('87', 381, 5, 13, 563660) We lazily copy the Congress and set up committees and think that we shall thereby popularize and advance the craft of the villages.
('87', 381, 5, 14, 563792) We forget that the Congress, being a democratic body, must work democratically and through committees set up by the people from [among] themselves.
('87', 381, 5, 15, 563940) On the other hand, the A.I.V.I.A. and like bodies are self formed to work out particular purposes often requiring high technical skill.
('87', 381, 5, 16, 564076) They collect money from those who appreciate the particular purpose and become trustees for the money to be used therefor.
('87', 381, 5, 17, 564199) We collect and study the literature on the subject.
('87', 381, 5, 18, 564251) We look about for and employ experts and if there are none become experts ourselves.
('87', 381, 5, 19, 564336) The work will make progress in exact proportion to our knowledge, earnestness and industry.
('87', 381, 5, 20, 564428) The work itself may be unpopular or unknown.
('87', 381, 5, 21, 564473) We have then to make it popular or known.
('87', 381, 5, 22, 564515) Such associations all over the world must work whether in countries democratically or autocratically governed.
('87', 381, 5, 23, 564626) In either case they must work under patronage or in the teeth of opposition.
('87', 381, 5, 24, 564703) The system of work will be identical under either autocracy or democracy.
('87', 381, 5, 25, 564777) With us the A. I. S. A., the A. I. V. I. A., the Hindustani Talimi Sangh, etc., though autonomous, are creations of the Congress and, therefore requiring enthusiastic support of all Congressmen and, to the extent that Congressmen represent all India, of Indians throughout the land.
('87', 381, 5, 26, 565060) But before this can happen we must dot India with experts of the type wanted.
('87', 381, 5, 27, 565138) Therefore, the first thing is to have a central body of honest experts.
('87', 381, 5, 28, 565210) There is no other royal road to success.
('87', 381, 5, 29, 565251) Committees or even agents can show no results unless they are experts who know their
('87', 382, 0, 1, 565336) VOL. 87 : 29 MAY, 1945 29 AUGUST, 1945 383
('87', 382, 1, 2, 565379) Can an M.A., however brilliant he may be, introduce, say, the charkha among the villagers, or gur making from palm trees or manure making from village refuse including human excreta and cattle dung?
('87', 382, 1, 3, 565578) We must have experts in these and such other branches.
('87', 382, 1, 4, 565633) If we had our own government, however inefficient, we would have technical institutes where every one of the useful activities now going on or which were going on even yesterday in the 7,00,000 villages could be studied.
('87', 382, 1, 5, 565854) Unfortunately, we have not.
('87', 382, 1, 6, 565882) Hence our associations have also to be such institutes in addition to becoming propagandists.
('87', 382, 1, 7, 565976) But before we can become the latter, we have to become the former.
('87', 382, 1, 8, 566043) If I have drawn a correct picture, let us mend even though the mending may be difficult and even hurtful to our pride.

('87', 382, 4, 15, 566458) It is not as easy to understand as the first.

('87', 382, 4, 17, 566579) When I took up the manuscript I was curious to know what it could contain.
('87', 382, 4, 18, 566654) The opening chapter satisfied my curiosity and led me on to the end without fatigue and yet with profit.
('87', 382, 4, 19, 566759) This doctor of our village industries shows that only through them we shall arrive at the economy of permanence in the place of that of the fleeting nature we see around us at present.
('87', 382, 4, 20, 566944) He tackles the question—shall the body triumph over and stifle the soul or shall the latter triumph over and express itself through a perishable body which, with its few wants healthily satisfied, will be free to subserve the end of the imperishable soul?

('87', 387, 10, 16, 572753) It is, as you will see, based on the papers I gave him at your instance some time ago.
('87', 387, 11, 17, 572840) Having had the opinion, you have the right to publish it for what it may be worth.
('87', 387, 11, 18, 572923) The news, almost daily poured into my ears by Congressmen to the effect that the Party is unscrupulous in its methods and that it even resorts to violence, makes it difficult for me to accept the opinion which is after all based on the papers that were in my possession on the date they were handed to the Advocate.
('87', 387, 11, 19, 573239) But I cannot judge the Party on one sided evidence.

('87', 388, 1, 4, 573709) The best course perhaps is for you to consider the position in the light of Congressmen’s opinion about the Party and then do what may appear best to you.

('87', 389, 13, 25, 575495) All of a sudden I remembered what it contained, though I cannot recall the whole letter.
('87', 389, 13, 26, 575584) You are not to work as a clerk at all.
('87', 389, 13, 27, 575623) That is why I sent the message that I would send Valjibhai’s son.

('87', 390, 1, 5, 576133) Shyamlal on his own has reduced his salary by Rs. 100. I like the decision but what is surprising about it?
('87', 390, 1, 6, 576241) I have thanked him for it.

('87', 393, 3, 5, 579919) Why did you have to write in English?
('87', 393, 3, 6, 579957) Hindustani would have been sufficient.
('87', 393, 3, 7, 579996) The English needs improvement.
('87', 393, 3, 8, 580027) You must leave that to others.

('87', 405, 9, 11, 593784) Why should they have the monopoly?
('87', 405, 9, 12, 593819) You are getting on.
('87', 405, 9, 13, 593839) My article should considerably lighten your administrative work which sends up b.p.
('87', 405, 9, 14, 593923) The other will put it in its place.

('87', 407, 3, 5, 595667) You have apologized thrice.
('87', 407, 3, 6, 595695) But you were pardoned even without your asking.
('87', 407, 3, 7, 595743) Remember the lawyer’s maxim: Do not give judgment till you have examined all the evidence.
('87', 407, 3, 8, 595834) Your words have no effect on me as you have formed a habit of jumping to conclusions without examining things.

('87', 408, 8, 14, 597036) The weather is still moist.

('87', 408, 8, 16, 597135) But I do not have the courage to call you here till the weather completely clears.
('87', 408, 8, 17, 597218) We do not want to fall out of the frying pan into the fire.

('87', 408, 8, 28, 597862) Why should they be servants?
('87', 408, 8, 29, 597891) It is a matter of shame and sorrow that they are retained as servants.
('87', 408, 8, 30, 597962) Thenumber of those who are retained as servants will not be reduced by their staying in different places.
('87', 408, 8, 31, 598068) Only the attitude of everyone should be changed.
('87', 408, 8, 32, 598117) If that happens the question of staying separately or in different places should not arise.

('87', 409, 1, 5, 598560) There was and is a purpose in merging all the organizations, although whatever has happened was only a drifting of the current.

('87', 409, 1, 7, 598739) If the present situation cannot be changed I want to understand the whole position.

('87', 415, 3, 6, 604165) NOW Babudi has to be very careful about her diet.

('87', 415, 8, 15, 604566) In spite of my disinclination to answer the question like the one put to me by Mr. Emanuel Celler, I feel that I shall be wanting in courtesy, if I do not meet Mr. Celler’s wishes.
('87', 415, 8, 16, 604747) The best way for America to assist India’s struggle for independence is to study the question, so as not to be misled by the untruth that is being spread by British Agency at a great cost about India.
('87', 415, 8, 17, 604948) Americans have to get out of the way of her struggle.
('87', 415, 8, 18, 605002) For the rest, India has to fight her own battle of independence which she is trying to secure by a non violent technique.

('87', 415, 10, 21, 605330) Emanuel Celler had asked how “we in the United States can aid in hastening the attainment of India’s independence”.

('87', 419, 8, 14, 608832) Is your manner of eating different in any way?
('87', 419, 8, 15, 608879) If it is, think over it.
('87', 419, 8, 16, 608904) Even the manner of eating affects one’s digestion and also culture.
('87', 419, 8, 17, 608972) One man swallows food like birds, another gobbles like animals.
('87', 419, 8, 18, 609036) We are neither animals nor birds.
('87', 419, 8, 19, 609070) Human beings chew and eat.
('87', 419, 8, 20, 609097) In fact, it looks bad if one eats in a careless manner or makes a sound while others are eating.

('87', 422, 8, 14, 611600) PARNERKAR, I do not think that your letter is long.
('87', 422, 8, 15, 611652) The subject matter required that much.
('87', 422, 8, 16, 611691) What can be done if you can’t sit together and make up your minds?
('87', 422, 8, 17, 611758) What will you do if I die?
('87', 422, 8, 18, 611785) Will you all be separated from each other?
('87', 422, 8, 19, 611828) The Goshala, the Talimi Sangh, the Charkha Sangh and the Ashram are together because they were all conceived by one man— other two exist separately merely by chance.
('87', 422, 8, 20, 611994) They could both havebeen located at one place.
('87', 422, 8, 21, 612041) As far as the site is concerned the Ashram and the Goshala should coexist.
('87', 422, 8, 22, 612116) This has to be thought over.
('87', 422, 8, 23, 612145) I have liked your letter and so sent it to the Ashram.
('87', 422, 8, 24, 612200) Do think over the matter if you can.
('87', 422, 8, 25, 612237) But if it is not possible leave it.
('87', 422, 8, 26, 612273) It can’t be solved by devoting more time to it.
('87', 422, 8, 27, 612321) We must know the subject is beyond our ken if we have to devote too much time to it.

('87', 423, 3, 4, 612653) PUSHPA, I have your letter.
('87', 423, 3, 5, 612681) You should definitely not write to Rajani just now.
('87', 423, 3, 6, 612733) Your father and his relatives have just left me, and I am now writing to you.
('87', 423, 3, 7, 612811) It is nine o’clock at night.
('87', 423, 3, 8, 612840) If you wish, I will write to Rajani.
('87', 423, 3, 9, 612877) If you want me to write, send me his address.
('87', 423, 3, 10, 612923) I showed your letter to your father.
('87', 423, 3, 11, 612960) He does not trust Rajani.
('87', 423, 3, 12, 612986) He would like you to marry Vrajlal.
('87', 423, 3, 13, 613022) He says the latter is ready to observe brahmacharya till you desire otherwise.
('87', 423, 3, 14, 613101) He will not act against your will.
('87', 423, 3, 15, 613136) Nor will he interfere with your prayers and worship.
('87', 423, 3, 16, 613189) Manibehn has also seen a letter from Vrajlal to this effect.
('87', 423, 3, 17, 613250) If this is true, such a marriage will not prove an obstacle to you in your striving for a vision of Krishna.
('87', 423, 3, 18, 613359) Vrajlal will be happy and so will be your parents and other well wishers.
('87', 423, 3, 19, 613433) I tell you on the basis of my own experience that there will be no harm in agreeing to the proposed marriage.
('87', 423, 3, 20, 613543) Only, you should have genuine bhakti 1. Reply to me immediately.

('87', 424, 3, 4, 614221) LETTER FROM JAIRAMDAS DAULATRAM TO ANAND T. HINGORANI 1
('87', 424, 4, 5, 614277) PANCHGANI, June 10, 1945
('87', 424, 5, 6, 614302) DEAR BROTHER,
('87', 424, 6, 7, 614316) You must have received my letter sent from here.
('87', 424, 6, 8, 614365) Your letter of the 3rd June addressed to Bapu was received by him today.
('87', 424, 6, 9, 614438) There is a great pressure of work on him, so he has asked me to reply to it.
('87', 424, 7, 10, 614515) Bapu said that he had also received your earlier letter, but owing to rush of work he could not send a reply.
('87', 424, 7, 11, 614625) After coming here I am better able to realize what a tremendous burden of work rests on him and how he can deal with it only bit by bit on account of his reduced capacity.
('87', 424, 7, 12, 614797) There is no quick disposal of work as before.
('87', 424, 7, 13, 614843) Besides, the present happenings in the country also take up much of his time.
('87', 424, 8, 14, 614921) About the “Daily Thoughts”, Bapu inquired whether they would be published in Hindi only or there would also be English rendering simultaneously.If there is to be an English translation, then he will like to see it himself and this task he will not be able to shoulder at present.
('87', 424, 8, 15, 615201) I do not exactly remember what we had decided about the English translation.
('87', 424, 8, 16, 615278) So please write to me by return of post.
('87', 424, 8, 17, 615319) If it is only the Hindi edition, then there will be no difficulty in Bapu’s writing a preface to it.
('87', 424, 8, 18, 615420) Perhaps it would be easier for him to find time for it.
('87', 424, 9, 19, 615476) As regards the questions you had sent to Bapu in respect of your book “To the Statesmen of the World”, Bapu says that he would have gladly answered them, but that at the present moment his mind is not disposed to undertake that burden either.
('87', 424, 9, 20, 615719) You will, therefore, have to do without his answer to your questions.
('87', 424, 10, 21, 615789) I had spoken to Bapu regarding the Navajivan and the “Gandhi Series”.
('87', 424, 10, 22, 615859) He advised me that since Naraharibhai was here, I should personally hear what he has to say.
('87', 424, 10, 23, 615952) I had, therefore, a brief talk with him last evening and will have further discussion with him again today.
('87', 424, 10, 24, 616060) Then we shall see where the matter stands.
('87', 424, 11, 25, 616103) Have you got enough supply of paper for bringing out your new book “To the Statesmen”?
('87', 424, 11, 26, 616190) I learn that the Government is increasing the paper quota.
('87', 424, 11, 27, 616249) How far is it

('87', 425, 5, 8, 616585) SPEECH BROADCAST BY THE VICEROY 1
('87', 425, 6, 9, 616619) June 14, 1945
('87', 425, 7, 10, 616633) I have been authorized by His Majesty’s Government to place before Indian political leaders proposals designed to ease the present political situation and to advance India towards her goal of full self government.
('87', 425, 7, 11, 616847) These proposals are at the present moment being explained to Parliament by the Secretary of State for India.
('87', 425, 7, 12, 616956) My intention in this broadcast is to explain to you the proposals, the ideas underlying them, and the method by which I hope to put them into effect.
('87', 425, 8, 13, 617106) This is not an attempt to obtain or impose a constitutional settlement.
('87', 425, 8, 14, 617178) His Majesty’s Government had hoped that the leaders of the Indian parties would agree amongst themselves on a settlement of the communal issue, which is the main stumbling block; but this hope has not been fulfilled.
('87', 425, 9, 15, 617395) In the mean time, India has great opportunities to be taken and great problems to be solved, which require a common effort by the leading men of all parties.
('87', 425, 9, 16, 617553) I, therefore, propose, with the full support of His Majesty’s Government, to invite Indian leaders, both of Central and Provincial politics, to take counsel with me with a view to the formation of a new Executive Council more representative of organized political opinion.
('87', 425, 9, 17, 617826) The proposed new Council would represent the main communities and would include equal proportions of caste Hindus and Muslims.
('87', 425, 9, 18, 617953) It would work, if formed, under the existing Constitution.
('87', 425, 9, 19, 618012) But it would be an entirely Indian Council, except for the Viceroy and the Commander in Chief, who would retain his position as War Member.
('87', 425, 9, 20, 618152) It is also proposed that the portfolio of External Affairs, which has hitherto been held by the Viceroy, should be placed in charge of an Indian Member of Council, so far as the interests of British India are concerned.
('87', 425, 10, 21, 618372) A further step proposed by His Majesty’s Government is the appointment of a
('87', 425, 11, 22, 618448) 1Vide “Telegram to Private Secretary to Viceroy”, 14 6 1945; “Telegram to Lord Wavell”, 15 6 1945; “Statement to the press”, 15 6 1945 and “Interview to associated Press of India”, 30 6 1945.
('87', 426, 0, 1, 618640) VOL. 87 : 29 MAY, 1945 29 AUGUST, 1945 427
('87', 426, 1, 2, 618683) British High Commissioner in India, as in the Dominions, to represent Great Britains’ commercial and other such interests in India.
('87', 426, 2, 3, 618815) Such a new Executive Council will, you realize, represent a definite advance on the road to self government.
('87', 426, 2, 4, 618924) It will be almost entirely Indian, and the Finance and Home Members will for the first time be Indians, while an Indian will also be charged with the management of India’s Foreign Affairs.
('87', 426, 2, 5, 619113) Moreover, Members will now be selected by the Governor General after consultations with political leaders; though their appointment will of course be subject to the approval of His Majesty the King Emperor.
('87', 426, 3, 6, 619320) The council will work within the framework of the present constitution and there can be no question of the Governor General agreeing not to exercise his constitutional power of control; but it will of course not be exercised unreasonably.
('87', 426, 4, 7, 619559) I should make it clear that the formation of this interim Government will in no way prejudice the final constitutional settlement.
('87', 426, 5, 8, 619690) The main task for this new Executive Council would be:
('87', 426, 6, 9, 619745) First, to prosecute the war against Japan with the utmost energy till Japan is utterly defeated.
('87', 426, 7, 10, 619842) Secondly, to carry on the Government of British India, with all the manifold tasks of post war development in front of it, until a new permanent constitution can be agreed upon and come into force.
('87', 426, 8, 11, 620040) Thirdly, to consider, when the Members of the Government think it possible, the means by which such agreement can be achieved.
('87', 426, 8, 12, 620167) The third task is most important.
('87', 426, 8, 13, 620201) I want to make it quite clear that neither I nor His Majesty’s Government have lost sight of the need for a long term solution, and that the present proposals are intended to make a long term solution easier.
('87', 426, 9, 14, 620410) I have considered the best means of forming such a Council; and have decided to invite the following to Viceregal Lodge to advise me:
('87', 426, 10, 15, 620544) Those now holding office as Premier in a Provincial Government; or, for provinces now under Section 93 Government, those who last held the office of the Premier.
('87', 426, 11, 16, 620706) The Leader of the Congress Party and the Deputy Leader of the Muslim League in the Central Assembly; the leader of the Congress Party and the Muslim League in the Council of State; also the leader of the Nationalist Party and the European Group in the Assembly.
('87', 426, 12, 17, 620968) Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Jinnah as the recognized leaders of the two main political parties.
('87', 426, 13, 18, 621055) Rao Bahadur N. Siva Raj to represent the Scheduled Classes.
('87', 426, 14, 19, 621115) Master Tara Singh to represent the Sikhs.
('87', 427, 0, 1, 621157) 428 THE COLLETED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('87', 427, 1, 2, 621198) Invitations to these gentlemen are being handed to them today and it is proposed to assemble the conference on 25th June at Simla where we shall be cooler than at Delhi.
('87', 427, 2, 3, 621368) I trust that all those invited will attend the conference and give me their help.
('87', 427, 2, 4, 621450) On me and on them will lie a heavy responsibility in this fresh attempt to make progress towards a final settlement of India’s future.
('87', 427, 3, 5, 621585) If the meeting is successful, I hope that we shall be able to agree on the formation of the new Executive Council at the Centre.
('87', 427, 3, 6, 621714) I also hope that it will be possible for Ministries to re assume office and again undertake the tasks of Government in the provinces now administered under Section 93 of the Constitution Act and that these Ministries will be coalitions.
('87', 427, 4, 7, 621951) If the meeting should unfortunately fail, we must carry on as at present until the parties are ready to come together.
('87', 427, 4, 8, 622070) The existing Executive Council, which has done such valuable work for India will continue it if other arrangements cannot be agreed.
('87', 427, 5, 9, 622203) But I have every hope that the meeting will succeed, if the party leaders will approach the problem with the sincere intention of working with me and with each other.
('87', 427, 5, 10, 622370) I can assure them that there is behind this proposal a most genuine desire on the part of all responsible leaders in the United Kingdom and of the British people as a whole to help India towards her goal.
('87', 427, 5, 11, 622575) I believe that this is more than a step towards that goal, it is a considerable stride forward, and a stride on the right path.
('87', 427, 6, 12, 622703) I should make it clear that these proposals affect British India only and do not make any alteration in the relations of the Princes with the Crown Representative.
('87', 427, 7, 13, 622867) With the approval of His Majesty’s Government, and after consultation with my Council, orders have been given for the immediate release of the members of the Working Committee of Congress who are still in detention.
('87', 427, 7, 14, 623083) I propose to leave the final decision about the others still under detention as the result of the 1942 disturbances to the new Central Government, if formed, and to the Provincial governments.
('87', 427, 8, 15, 623276) The appropriate time for fresh elections for the Central and Provincial legislatures will be discussed at the conference.
('87', 427, 9, 16, 623398) Finally, I would ask you all to help in creating the atmosphere of goodwill and mutual confidence that is essential if we are to make progress.
('87', 427, 9, 17, 623542) The destiny of this great country and of the many millions who live in it depends on the wisdom and good understanding of the leaders, both of action and of thought, British and Indian, at this critical moment of India’s history.
('87', 427, 10, 18, 623772) India’s military reputation never stood higher in the world than it does at present; thanks to the exploits of her sons drawn from all parts of the country.
('87', 427, 10, 19, 623929) Her representatives at international conference have won high regard for their
('87', 428, 0, 1, 624008) VOL. 87 : 29 MAY, 1945 29 AUGUST, 1945 429
('87', 428, 1, 2, 624051) statesmanlike attitude.
('87', 428, 1, 3, 624075) Sympathy for India’s aspirations and progress towards prosperity was never greater or more widespread.
('87', 428, 1, 4, 624178) We have thus great assets if we can use them wisely.
('87', 428, 1, 5, 624231) But it will not be easy, it will not be quick; there is very much to do, there are many pitfalls and dangers.
('87', 428, 1, 6, 624341) There is on all sides something to forgive and forget.
('87', 428, 2, 7, 624396) I believe in the future of India, and as far as in me lies will further her greatness.
('87', 428, 2, 8, 624483) I ask you all for your co operation and goodwill.

('87', 428, 6, 13, 624664) Immediate NEW DELHI, June 16, 1945 M. K. GANDHI ESQ.
('87', 428, 6, 14, 624717) PANCHGANI
('87', 428, 7, 15, 624727) Many thanks for your telegram of 15th June.
('87', 428, 7, 16, 624771) I have also seen your statement in today’s newspapers.
('87', 428, 7, 17, 624826) As regards your attendance at the conference I will await your letter referred to in your telegram of 16th June which I have just received.
('87', 428, 7, 18, 624966) I assure you, term “caste Hindus” was not used with offensiveintention.
('87', 428, 7, 19, 625038) Meaning is that there should be equality between Muslims and Hindus other than members of scheduled castes.
('87', 428, 7, 20, 625146) Subject to this, exact composition of council would of course have to be decided after discussion at conference.
('87', 428, 7, 21, 625259) On question of independence I invite your attention to Secretary of State’s speech in Parliament on 14th June as published in Indian Press.
('87', 428, 7, 22, 625399) Following is the relevant passage:
('87', 428, 8, 23, 625434) The offer of March 1942 stands in its entirety.
('87', 428, 8, 24, 625482) That offer is based on two main principles.
('87', 428, 8, 25, 625526) First, no limit is set to India’s freedom to decide her own destiny whether as a free partner in the Commonwealth or even without it.
('87', 428, 8, 26, 625660) Second, that this can only be achieved under a constitution or constitutions framed by Indians to which the main elements are consenting parties.
('87', 428, 8, 27, 625806) It would not be practicable to modify the terms of my broadcast.
('87', 428, 8, 28, 625871) It is only a simple statement of the proposals approved by His Majesty’s Government and my intention is to deal at the conference itself with any points requiring clarification.
('87', 428, 8, 29, 626049) I do not think it advisable to enter into detailed discussions before the conference which I hope, as you do yourself, will be held in a friendly atmosphere and without party bitterness.
('87', 428, 8, 30, 626236) As you suggest I am releasing our telegrams to the Press.

('87', 429, 3, 4, 626519) The Congress and the League agree that they will join in forming an interim government in the Centre.
('87', 429, 3, 5, 626621) The composition of such Government will be on the following lines:
('87', 429, 4, 6, 626688) (a) An equal number of persons nominated by the Congress and the League in the Central Executive (the persons nominated need not be members of the Central Legislature),
('87', 429, 5, 7, 626857) (b) representatives of minorities (in particular the Scheduled Castes and the Sikhs),
('87', 429, 6, 8, 626943) (c) the Commander in Chief.
('87', 429, 7, 9, 626971) The Government will be formed and will function within the framework of the existing Government of India Act.
('87', 429, 7, 10, 627081) It is, however, understood that, if the Cabinet cannot get a particular measure passed by the Legislative Assembly, they will not enforce the same by resort to any of the reserve powers of the Governor General or the Viceroy.
('87', 429, 7, 11, 627307) This will make them sufficiently independent of the Governor General.
('87', 429, 8, 12, 627377) It is agreed between the Congress and the League that, if such interim government is formed, their first step would be to release the Working Committee members of the Congress.
('87', 429, 9, 13, 627554) The steps by which efforts would be made to achieve this end are at present indicated to take the following course:
('87', 429, 10, 14, 627670) On the basis of the above understanding some way should he found to get the Governor General to make a proposal or a suggestion that he desires an interim Government to be formed in the Centre on the agreement between the Congress and the League and when the Governor General invites Mr. Jinnah and Mr. Desai either jointly or separately, the above proposal would be made declaring that they are prepared to join in forming the government.
('87', 429, 11, 15, 628110) The next step would be to get the withdrawal of Section 93 in the Provinces and to form as soon as possible Provincial Governments on the lines of a coalition.

('87', 431, 2, 3, 629678) STATEMENT MADE IN PARLIAMENT BY SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA 1
('87', 431, 3, 4, 629741) June 14, 1945
('87', 431, 4, 5, 629755) During the recent visit of Field Marshal Viscount Wavell to this country, His Majesty’s Government reviewed with him a number of problems and discussed particularly the present political situation in India.
('87', 431, 5, 6, 629962) Members will be aware that since the offer by His Majesty’s Government to India of March 1942, there has been no further progress towards the solution of the Indian constitutional problem.
('87', 431, 6, 7, 630151) As was then stated, the working out of India’s new constitutional system is a task which can only be carried through by the Indian people themselves.
('87', 431, 7, 8, 630301) While His Majesty’s Government are at all times most anxious to do their utmost to assist the Indians in the working out of a new constitutional settlement, it would be a contradiction in terms to speak of the imposition by this country of self governing institutions upon an unwilling India.
('87', 431, 7, 9, 630594) Such a thing is not possible, nor could we accept the responsibility for enforcing such institutions at the very time when we were, by its purpose, withdrawing from all control of British Indian affairs.
('87', 431, 8, 10, 630798) The main constitutional position remains therefore as it was.
('87', 431, 8, 11, 630860) The offer of March 1942 stands in its entirety without change or qualification.
('87', 431, 8, 12, 630940) His Majesty’s Government still hope that the political leaders in India may be able to come to an agreement as to the procedure whereby India’s permanent future form of government can be determined.
('87', 431, 9, 13, 631139) His Majesty’s Government are, however, most anxious to make any contribution that is practicable to the breaking of the political deadlock in India.
('87', 431, 9, 14, 631288) While that deadlock lasts not only political but social and economic progress is being hampered.
('87', 431, 10, 15, 631385) The Indian administration, over burdened with the great tasks laid upon it by the war against Japan and by the planning for the post war period, is further strained by the political tension that exists.
('87', 431, 11, 16, 631588) All that is so urgently required to be done for agricultural development and for the peasants and workers of India cannot be carried through unless whole hearted co operation of every community and section of the Indian people is forthcoming.
('87', 431, 12, 17, 631831) His Majesty’s Government have therefore considered whether there is
('87', 431, 13, 18, 631899) 1Vide “Interview to The Press”, 18 6 1945.
('87', 432, 0, 1, 631942) VOL. 87 : 29 MAY, 1945 29 AUGUST, 1945 433
('87', 432, 1, 2, 631985) something which they could suggest in this interim period, under the existing constitution, pending the formulation by Indians of their future constitutional arrangements which would enable the main communities and parties to co operate more closely together and with the British to the benefit of the people of India as a whole.
('87', 432, 2, 3, 632315) It is not the intention of His Majesty’s Government to introduce any change contrary to the wishes of the major Indian communities.
('87', 432, 2, 4, 632447) But they are willing to make possible some steps forward during the interim period if the leaders of the principal Indian parties are prepared to agree to their suggestion and to co operate in the successful conclusion of the war against Japan as well as in the reconstruction in India which must follow the final victory.
('87', 432, 3, 5, 632770) To this end they would be prepared to see an important change in the composition of the Viceroy’s Executive.
('87', 432, 3, 6, 632879) This is possible without making any change in the existing statute law except for one amendment to the Ninth Schedule to the Act of 1935. That Schedule contains a provision that not less than three members of the Executive must have had at least 10 years’ service under the Crown in India.
('87', 432, 3, 7, 633169) If the proposals I am about to lay before the House meet with acceptance in India, that clause would have to be amended to dispense with that requirement.
('87', 432, 4, 8, 633324) It is proposed that the Executive Council should be reconstituted and that the Viceroy should in future make his selection to the Crown for appointment to his Executive from amongst leaders of Indian political life at the Centre and in the Provinces, in proportions which would give a balanced representation of the main communities, including equal proportions of Muslims and caste Hindus.
('87', 432, 5, 9, 633715) In order to pursue this object, the Viceroy will call into conference a number of leading Indian politicians who are the heads of the most important parties or who have had recent experience as Prime Ministers of Provinces, together with a few others of special experience and authority.
('87', 432, 5, 10, 634003) The Viceroy intends to put before this conference the proposal that the Executive Council should be reconstituted as above stated and to invite from the members of the conference a list of names.
('87', 432, 5, 11, 634199) Out of these he would hope to be able to choose the future members whom he would recommend for appointment by his Majesty to the Viceroy’s council, although the responsibility for the recommendations must of course continue to rest with him, and his freedom of choice therefore remains unrestricted.
('87', 432, 6, 12, 634499) The members of his Council who are chosen as a result of this arrangement would of course accept the position on the basis that they would whole heartedly co operate in supporting and carrying through the war against Japan to its victorious conclusion.
('87', 432, 7, 13, 634752) The members of the Executive would be Indians with the exception of the Viceroy and the Commander in Chief, who would retain his position as War

('87', 433, 1, 2, 634938) Member.
('87', 433, 1, 3, 634946) This is essential so long as the defence of India remains a British responsibility.
('87', 433, 2, 4, 635030) Nothing contained in any of these proposals will affect the relations of the Crown with the Indian States through the Viceroy as Crown Representative.
('87', 433, 3, 5, 635181) The Viceroy has been authorized by His Majesty’s Government to place this proposal before the Indian leaders.
('87', 433, 3, 6, 635291) His Majesty’s Government trust that the leaders of the Indian communities will respond.
('87', 433, 3, 7, 635379) For the success of such a plan must depend on its acceptance in India and the degree to which responsible Indian politicians are prepared to co operate with the object of making it a workable interim arrange ment.
('87', 433, 3, 8, 635593) In the absence of such general acceptance existing arrangements must neces sarily continue.
('87', 433, 4, 9, 635685) If such co operation can be achieved at the Centre it will no doubt be reflected in the provinces and so enable responsible governments to be set up once again in those provinces where, owing to the withdrawal of the majority party from participation, it became necessary to put into force the powers of the Governors under Section 93 of the Act of 1935. It is to be hoped that in all the Provinces these governments would be based on the participation of the main parties, thus smoothing out communal differences and allowing Ministers to concentrate upon their very heavy administrative tasks.
('87', 433, 5, 10, 636281) There is one further change which, if these proposals are accepted, His Majesty’s Government suggest should follow.
('87', 433, 6, 11, 636397) That is, that External Affairs (other than those tribal and frontier matters which fall to be dealt with as part of the defence of India) should be placed in the charge of an Indian Member of the Viceroy’s Executive so far as British India is concerned, and that fully accredited representatives shall be appointed for the representation of India abroad.
('87', 433, 7, 12, 636752) By their acceptance of and co operation in this scheme the Indian leaders will not only be able to make their immediate contribution to the direction of Indian affairs, but it is also to be hoped that their experience of co operation in government will expedite agreement between them as to the method of working out the new constitutional arrangements.
('87', 433, 8, 13, 637106) His Majesty’s Government consider, after the most careful study of the question, that the plan now suggested gives the utmost progress practicable within the present constitution.
('87', 433, 8, 14, 637286) None of the changes suggested will in any way prejudice or prejudge the essential form of the future permanent constitution or constitutions for India.
('87', 433, 9, 15, 637438) His Majesty’s Government feel certain that given goodwill and a genuine desire to co operate on all sides, both British and Indian, these proposals can mark a

('87', 434, 4, 5, 637915) LORD WAVELL’S NOTE ON HIS INTERVIEW 1
('87', 434, 5, 6, 637953) June 24, 1945
('87', 434, 6, 7, 637967) I began by making a short statement on the objects of the proposals of H. M. G., the spirit in which they were conceived and the spirit in which I hoped they would be accepted and worked.
('87', 434, 6, 8, 638155) I emphasized the necessity for full support of the war, and that it was essential that the political parties should put in their very best men, determined to concentrate on the economic and other problems of India, and not merely to enter the Government in a party spirit.
('87', 434, 7, 9, 638428) Mr. Gandhi then made a long, tortuous and prolix statement, which dealt with the history of the Congress, British rule in India, British character, the qualities of a good soldier, and many other more or less relevant subjects.
('87', 434, 7, 10, 638656) It lasted over half an hour, and ended with a sort of general blessing on the proposals, which he said he had recommended to the Working Committee.
('87', 434, 8, 11, 638804) He then went on, referring to some notes, to deal with certain other points.
('87', 434, 8, 12, 638881) I think this was a list prepared for him as a result of the discussions by Congress Working Committee.
('87', 434, 8, 13, 638984) The main points were as follows:
('87', 434, 9, 14, 639017) (a) That it would have been much better if I had ordered the release of all the political prisoners and not merely the Working Committee.
('87', 434, 10, 15, 639155) (b) That the term ‘Caste Hindus’ should not have been used, as his great aim was that there should be no question of caste inside Congress; he would have preferred the term ‘Non Scheduled Hindus’.
('87', 434, 11, 16, 639352) (c) He then went on to the question of coalitions in Provinces, obviously with the idea of trying to establish that the minorities should be represented by members of their body belonging to Congress.
('87', 434, 12, 17, 639553) (d) He referred to the matter of parity, and said he had been under very severe pressure as regards this, but that he was prepared to accept it.
('87', 434, 12, 18, 639698) He indicated that it would be open to Congress to put forward the names of Muslims or Scheduled Castes, and I agreed but said that the principle of parity between non Scheduled Hindus and Muslims must be maintained.
('87', 434, 13, 19, 639914) (e) He then digressed into a long story about members of the Indian Army who
('87', 434, 14, 20, 639991) 1 Vide “Letter to Lord Wavell”, 25 6 1945.
('87', 435, 0, 1, 640034) 436 THE COLLETED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('87', 435, 1, 2, 640075) had wished to see him but had been compelled, like Nicodemus, to come to him by night and in mufti.
('87', 435, 1, 3, 640175) I said that the one thing which was disastrous for any government was if the army became political; that the Indian Army had a Commander in Chief in whom they had full trust; that their reputation never stood higher and that I could assure him that the Indian Army was on the whole a thoroughly contented body.
('87', 435, 1, 4, 640486) He agreed to all these statements.
('87', 435, 2, 5, 640521) (f) He then started on the question of the Indian States.
('87', 435, 2, 6, 640579) I said that the conference dealt entirely with British India, and that I was not prepared at this stage to enter into a discussion of the Indian States.
('87', 435, 2, 7, 640732) He agreed that it had nothing to do with the conference and was not appropriate for discussion at the moment.
('87', 435, 3, 8, 640842) I asked Mr. Gandhi at the end, whether he proposed to attend the conference in person.
('87', 435, 3, 9, 640929) He said that he represented nobody except himself, and that though he would be prepared to attend the conference if I wished, and sit in a corner, he strongly advised me that his presence at the conference was undesirable.
('87', 435, 3, 10, 641152) He said that he would hold himself at my disposal for as long as I wished, but that if I had nothing on which I had to consult him he would propose to leave Simla tomorrow.
('87', 435, 3, 11, 641325) I said that I would let him know.
('87', 435, 4, 12, 641359) The interview was mainly a discursive monologue by Mr. Gandhi, interspersed by numerous digressions, such as a most graphic description of the death of his Private Secretary and the relation of his carrying down the wounded General Woodgate from Spion Kop in 1899. My general impression of him was that he was friendly for the time being, but perfectly prepared to go back at any time on anything he had said.

('87', 436, 2, 3, 641861) ABUL KALAM AZAD’S LETTER TO LORD WAVELL1
('87', 436, 3, 4, 641902) ARMSDELL, SIMLA, July 15, 1945
('87', 436, 4, 5, 641933) DEAR LORD WAVELL,
('87', 436, 5, 6, 641951) After announcing the failure of the Conference, you were good enough to ask for the support of all parties in ensuring a calm atmosphere.
('87', 436, 5, 7, 642089) I do not propose to reiterate the Congress view about the failure.
('87', 436, 5, 8, 642156) I expressed it sufficiently at the Conference.
('87', 436, 5, 9, 642203) But in fairness to you and to ourselves I must point out that co operation inevitably depends on the removal of obstacles to it.
('87', 436, 5, 10, 642332) Some of these obstacles are of a psychological nature with roots in the past relations between India and England.
('87', 436, 5, 11, 642446) These can only gradually disappear with a change in those relations.
('87', 436, 5, 12, 642515) But there are others of a more tangible kind which serve as constant irritants to our people and which affect our day to day activity.
('87', 436, 5, 13, 642650) They are continually before us.
('87', 436, 5, 14, 642682) In spite of this preoccupation, however, we did not think it desirable to raise this matter, except perhaps rather vaguely in the course of conversations with you, as we were anxious not to place any difficulties in your path when you were dealing with a delicate situation.
('87', 436, 6, 15, 642957) 2. But now that one chapter has ended and our minds, as well as yours, are turned to future possibilities of finding a way out, honourable to all concerned and leading to the objective of Indian freedom, these obstacles to co operation cannot be ignored.
('87', 436, 6, 16, 643212) I am taking the liberty, therefore, of pointing them out to you in the hope that you will have early steps taken to have them removed.
('87', 436, 7, 17, 643347) 3. The steps that I consider necessary and earnestly urge upon you are:
('87', 436, 8, 18, 643419) (a) The bans on all Congress and allied organizations should be removed at once.
('87', 436, 8, 19, 643500) It has not been possible to convene the A. I. C. C. because of its being an illegal organization.
('87', 436, 9, 20, 643598) (b) All detenus should be released without any condition being imposed upon them, whether the detention was imposed by the Central Government or the Provincial Governments.
('87', 436, 10, 21, 643771) (c) All restrictions on the movements of released detenus or prisoners should be removed.
('87', 436, 11, 22, 643861) (d) Cases of all prisoners convicted for political or like offences should be examined by a popular judicial tribunal, its verdict should be regarded as final by the

('87', 437, 1, 2, 644124) Government.
('87', 437, 2, 3, 644136) (e) Extra legal restrictions on the freedom of the Press or on the movement or association of people should be removed so as to make the people feel that they are free to follow normal activities under democratic conditions.
('87', 437, 3, 4, 644361) (f) All pending sentences of hanging arising out of the disturbances of August 1942 should be commuted to life sentences.
('87', 437, 4, 5, 644483) (g) All pending arrests of ‘absconders’ should be cancelled.
('87', 437, 5, 6, 644544) (h) All prisoners who have served full fourteen years should be unconditionally discharged.
('87', 437, 6, 7, 644636) (i) What has been said above about prisoners applies equally, and with even greater force, to properties, movable and immovable, and frozen or confiscated.
('87', 437, 7, 8, 644792) 4. I have not endeavoured to argue out the justness of the foregoing requirements as I have no doubt that you will yourself appreciate the need for action along the lines indicated.
('87', 437, 7, 9, 644974) If India is on the eve of having a bona fide national representative Executive, leading to independence after the defeat of Japan, then the necessity for this approach is self proved and inevitable.
('87', 437, 8, 10, 645173) 5. There is another matter to which I should like to refer.
('87', 437, 8, 11, 645233) I need hardly say on behalf of the Congress that whatever the result of your promised effort the Congress is and has always been against the Japanese aggression.
('87', 437, 8, 12, 645395) Therefore, there will always be on the part of the Congress a desire for the defeat of Japan in her designs upon China or any other aggression on her part.
('87', 437, 8, 13, 645551) But the thought expressed in this paragraph will be incomplete if I did not inform you that, in the Congress estimation, the effort now being made on Indian soil will continue to be looked upon as a British and Allied effort, so long as there is not at the Centre a popular government assisted by provincial popular governments.
('87', 437, 8, 14, 645880) Yours sincerely, HIS EXCELLENCY VISCOUNT WAVELL VICEREGAL LODGE SIMLA
