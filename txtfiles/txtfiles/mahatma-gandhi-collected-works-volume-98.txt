('98', 0, 1, 2, 45) 1. GIVE AND TAKE1
('98', 0, 2, 3, 63) A Sindhi sufferer writes:
('98', 0, 3, 4, 89) At this critical time when thousands of our countrymen are leaving their ancestral homes and are pouring in from Sind, the Punjab and the N. W. F. P., I find that there is, in some sections of the Hindus, a provincial spirit.
('98', 0, 3, 5, 315) Those who are coming here suffered terribly and deserve all the warmth that the Hindus of the Indian Union can reasonably give.
('98', 0, 3, 6, 443) You have rightly called them dukhi, 2 though they are commonly called sharanarthis.
('98', 0, 4, 7, 527) problem is so great that no government can cope with it unless the people back the efforts with all their might.
('98', 0, 4, 8, 640) I am sorry to confess that some of the landlords have increased the rents of houses enormously and some are demanding pagri.
('98', 0, 4, 9, 765) May I request you to raise your voice against the provincial spirit and the pagri system specially at this time of terrible suffering?
('98', 0, 4, 10, 900) Though I sympathize with the writer, I cannot endorse his analysis.
('98', 0, 4, 11, 968) Nevertheless I am able to testify that there are rapacious landlords who are not ashamed to fatten themselves at the expense of the sufferers.
('98', 0, 4, 12, 1111) But I know personally that there are others who, though they may not be able or willing to go as far as the writer or I may wish, do put themselves to inconvenience in order to lessen the suffering of the victims.
('98', 0, 4, 13, 1325) The best way to lighten the burden is for the sufferers to learn how to profit by this unexpected blow.
('98', 0, 4, 14, 1429) They should learn the art of humility which demands a rigorous self searching rather than a search of others and consequent criticism, often harsh, oftener undeserved and only sometimes deserved.
('98', 0, 4, 15, 1625) Searching of self ennobles, searching of others debases.
('98', 0, 4, 16, 1682) The sufferers should learn the art and virtue of corporate life, in which the circumstance of co operation is ever widening till at last it encircles the whole human race.
('98', 0, 4, 17, 1854) If they do this no sufferer will live in isolation.
('98', 0, 4, 18, 1906) All of them, no matter to which province they belong, will hold together and would be considering not the welfare of self but that of all.
('98', 0, 4, 19, 2045) This does not mean that all of them will live or insist on living at one place, an impossible feat at any time, more so today, when lakhs upon lakhs of people have been torn from their homes, not knowing where to lay their heads upon.
('98', 0, 4, 20, 2280) But this humble spirit of co operation does mean that wherever

('98', 1, 1, 2, 2500) they are placed, they will feel one with all the sufferers, no matter from what strata of society they are drawn or to which province they belong.
('98', 1, 1, 3, 2647) Insistence on being accommodated in a particular place of one’s choice there will be none.
('98', 1, 1, 4, 2738) The sufferers will never grumble.
('98', 1, 1, 5, 2772) They will disdain to occupy houses belonging to Muslim owners or tenants, whether these places are physically occupied or evacuated.
('98', 1, 1, 6, 2905) It is for the Government to decide what they will do with property evacuated under abnormal conditions that are prevalent in India today.
('98', 1, 1, 7, 3043) The sufferers’ one and only care would be to hold together and act as one man.
('98', 1, 1, 8, 3122) It would be seen that if the idea thus presented takes shape and spreads, the problem of accommodating sufferers, otherwise styled refugees, will become incredibly simple and they will cease to be a menace.
('98', 1, 1, 9, 3329) Moreover, every sufferer who is not a cripple will do his or her full share of work against bread, clothing and shelter in a becoming manner.
('98', 1, 1, 10, 3471) Thus they will realize the dignity of labour and feel dependent upon no one.
('98', 1, 1, 11, 3548) All will be equal to one another irrespective of sex.
('98', 1, 1, 12, 3602) Some labour will be shared by all, e.g., sanitary work including latrine cleaning and scavenging.
('98', 1, 1, 13, 3700) No labour will be considered too low or too high.
('98', 1, 1, 14, 3750) In this society there will be no room for drones, idlers or loafers.
('98', 1, 1, 15, 3819) This camp life is any day superior to the city life of dirt and squalor side by side with palaces—difficult to decide which is a greater eyesore between the two.

('98', 1, 5, 19, 4057) December 6, 1947
('98', 1, 6, 20, 4074) VALJI, I read your article on the cinema 1 just now.
('98', 1, 6, 21, 4127) It took me some time to decipher some of the English words which were unfamiliar to me.
('98', 1, 6, 22, 4215) When you quote from a book, it will perhaps help if you send the book, too.
('98', 1, 6, 23, 4291) Alternatively, you may get the article typed or write it in a still clearer hand.
('98', 1, 6, 24, 4373) I would not be able to translate this article into Gujarati.
('98', 1, 6, 25, 4434) I myself did not follow all the English words fully.

('98', 2, 1, 3, 4691) Even if you cannot send the Hindi, send the Gujarati.
('98', 2, 1, 4, 4745) You may, if you wish, send it directly.
('98', 2, 1, 5, 4785) I am writing to the people at Ahmedabad not to translate it into Gujarati.
('98', 2, 1, 6, 4860) As for your previous articles, I am inquiring about them.

('98', 2, 6, 11, 5045) NEW DELHI, December 6, 1947
('98', 2, 7, 12, 5073) BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
('98', 2, 8, 13, 5095) You heard the bhajan and the Ramdhun sung by Subbula kshmi 1. She is new to Delhi.
('98', 2, 8, 14, 5178) Usually she gives music recitals.
('98', 2, 8, 15, 5212) One ought to lose oneself while singing bhajans and Ramdhun.
('98', 2, 8, 16, 5273) Today you must have realized why people are so keen to hear her.
('98', 2, 8, 17, 5338) She has a melodious voice.
('98', 2, 8, 18, 5365) I welcomed her message offering to come and sing here.
('98', 2, 8, 19, 5420) Today I do not wish to take more than 15 minutes.
('98', 2, 8, 20, 5470) Yesterday I took 25 minutes which was too long.
('98', 2, 8, 21, 5518) I am ashamed of it.
('98', 2, 8, 22, 5538) I must train myself to finish within 15 minutes.
('98', 2, 8, 23, 5587) Today I intend to take only 15 minutes and leave out what cannot be covered within that time.
('98', 2, 8, 24, 5681) I had a letter from a friend yesterday.
('98', 2, 8, 25, 5721) I have only been able to read a part of it.
('98', 2, 8, 26, 5765) I have another letter today which I have not been able to go through.
('98', 2, 8, 27, 5835) I must ask to be excused.
('98', 2, 8, 28, 5861) The letter which I have read in part says that I am too simple a man, that I do not know how the world’s affairs are run and am apt to be deceived.
('98', 2, 8, 29, 6009) The correspondent also explains the nature of the deception and cautions me to be careful.
('98', 2, 8, 30, 6100) He asks me to see what is happening in Pakistan and suggests that we should do the same here.
('98', 2, 8, 31, 6194) That we should take revenge I do not agree.
('98', 2, 8, 32, 6238) We cannot burn the houses of the Muslims.
('98', 2, 8, 33, 6280) However humble those houses may be they are as dear to their owners as the palaces of millionaires may be to them.
('98', 2, 8, 34, 6395) It is in these houses that they live.

('98', 3, 1, 2, 6530) a Muslim has to go to Pakistan he suffers.
('98', 3, 1, 3, 6573) The correspondent asks when the displaced Hindus and Sikhs can go back to their homes.
('98', 3, 1, 4, 6660) I may inform him that so long as they do not go back I shall not rest.
('98', 3, 1, 5, 6731) It is a different thing if they die before that happens.
('98', 3, 1, 6, 6788) So long as there is a single Hindu or Sikh left who does not get his house back, I shall not rest.
('98', 3, 1, 7, 6887) Yes, one may not ask that the house that has been burnt should be restored to its former state.
('98', 3, 1, 8, 6983) No government can do that, not even the Government of India.
('98', 3, 1, 9, 7044) I shall say that the Hindus and Sikhs should go to Model Town and stay there.
('98', 3, 1, 10, 7122) The Lahore Hindus and Sikhs can ask the Pakistan Government to return them their houses and their land just as they are.
('98', 3, 1, 11, 7243) All that they should ask is that the Muslims who have occupied their properties should be made to vacate them.
('98', 3, 1, 12, 7354) We cannot ask them to raise houses on the land.
('98', 3, 1, 13, 7402) They should merely return the land.
('98', 3, 1, 14, 7438) Those who are now in the Indian Union should become truthful and decent.
('98', 3, 1, 15, 7511) We must not imitate Pakistan.
('98', 3, 1, 16, 7541) If they cut off their noses we can’t do the same.
('98', 3, 1, 17, 7591) I shall further say to the correspondent that if we have made a mistake we must rectify it.
('98', 3, 1, 18, 7683) Everyone makes mistakes.
('98', 3, 1, 19, 7708) Only, one must not repeat them.
('98', 3, 1, 20, 7740) Man is liable to err, even as he has the potentiality to do good.
('98', 3, 1, 21, 7806) Once he rectifies his mistakes, he can only do good.
('98', 3, 1, 22, 7859) If we stick to our dharma it is not necessary to advertise it to the world.
('98', 3, 1, 23, 7935) I have had to write on what happened to Kathiawar Muslims.
('98', 3, 1, 24, 7994) I did the right thing.
('98', 3, 1, 25, 8017) It is good to tell the Hindus there about it.
('98', 3, 1, 26, 8063) It is good to tell the Government.
('98', 3, 1, 27, 8098) It is our right.
('98', 3, 1, 28, 8115) When we agreed to the formation of Pakistan we had not bargained for the houses of Hindus and Sikhs being burnt in Pakistan and their being driven out of the country.
('98', 3, 1, 29, 8282) If mistakes have been made they must be rectified.
('98', 3, 1, 30, 8333) Of course they can say that we should also rectify our own mistakes.
('98', 3, 1, 31, 8402) They may say that the Muslims who had gone to Pakistan were driven out of India and that they should be taken back.
('98', 3, 1, 32, 8518) If that is done the displaced Hindus and Sikhs could go back to Pakistan and the displaced Muslims in Pakistan could come back to India.
('98', 3, 1, 33, 8655) This will be good both for India and Pakistan.
('98', 3, 1, 34, 8702) If not, then both the countries will fall in the eyes of the world.
('98', 3, 1, 35, 8770) We have always conducted ourselves honourably.
('98', 3, 1, 36, 8817) We won our freedom honourably.
('98', 3, 1, 37, 8848) It is not I who say it.
('98', 3, 1, 38, 8872) It is not Hindus and Muslims who say it.
('98', 3, 1, 39, 8913) It is the whole world that says that we have attained our freedom by honourable means.
('98', 3, 1, 40, 9000) We should preserve it by honourable means and not by resorting to rowdyism.
('98', 3, 1, 41, 9076) Rowdyism could be the way to lose our freedom.
('98', 3, 1, 42, 9123) If we keep our conduct and our
('98', 4, 0, 1, 9154) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 5
('98', 4, 1, 2, 9199) behaviour clean the world will see that we have made amends for our former mistakes.
('98', 4, 1, 3, 9284) What is the world going to do about Pakistan —you may ask.
('98', 4, 1, 4, 9343) I shall say that the world does not have to do anything or say anything.
('98', 4, 1, 5, 9416) Pakistan has to cleanse itself.
('98', 4, 1, 6, 9448) I am reminded that the Resolution 1 passed by the A. I. C. C. had my support and that I am responsible for its being passed.
('98', 4, 1, 7, 9573) I am however told that people do not want it.
('98', 4, 1, 8, 9619) Displaced Hindus and Sikhs do not want to go back to Pakistan.
('98', 4, 1, 9, 9682) I do not say that they should go back as beggars.
('98', 4, 1, 10, 9732) True, they have come away from Pakistan because they were helpless.
('98', 4, 1, 11, 9800) But they must go back with dignity.
('98', 4, 1, 12, 9836) The Pakistan Muslims should tell them that they have changed for the better and now invite them to go back.
('98', 4, 1, 13, 9944) Similarly we should tell the Muslims who have gone away that their houses and their land are as they had left behind and that they should come and occupy them.
('98', 4, 1, 14, 10104) If we get over our madness and behave as gentlemen, things will be all right.
('98', 4, 1, 15, 10182) Where is the deception here?
('98', 4, 1, 16, 10211) I do not deceive anyone.
('98', 4, 1, 17, 10236) The world should not look for deception here.
('98', 4, 1, 18, 10282) The A. I. C. C. has passed the Resolution that the displaced Hindus and Sikhs should all go back to their homes and land in Lyallpur and they should be invited to do so with love.
('98', 4, 1, 19, 10462) Our Sikh brethren used to be farmers there.
('98', 4, 1, 20, 10506) They have to go there in any case.
('98', 4, 1, 21, 10541) This is my dream.
('98', 4, 1, 22, 10559) I wish to live to see this dream realized.
('98', 4, 1, 23, 10602) If it is not the will of God that this dream be realized, He will take me away.
('98', 4, 1, 24, 10682) That is why I am staying on in Delhi.
('98', 4, 1, 25, 10720) If I cannot do this here, where else can I do anything?
('98', 4, 1, 26, 10776) If only Pakistan would mend its ways, confess its errors and assure us that it would behave decently, all would be well and we could live as good neighbours.
('98', 4, 1, 27, 10934) There is no reason why we should remain enemies of each other.
('98', 4, 1, 28, 10997) Enmity cannot be our dharma.
('98', 4, 1, 29, 11026) I have concluded within ten minutes today.

('98', 5, 2, 3, 11346) NEW DELHI, December 7, 1947
('98', 5, 3, 4, 11374) QUESTION: Should the sevikas 1 of the Kasturba Trust be given instruction in
('98', 5, 4, 5, 11451) first aid and home remedies or should this be a different department?
('98', 5, 4, 6, 11521) For instance, should the women engaged in Nayee Talim and khadi work receive such training too?
('98', 5, 5, 7, 11617) GANDHIJI: I do hold that any woman who wants to be an all round village worker must have a basic training in nursing.
('98', 5, 5, 8, 11735) That is to say she must know how to deal with and treat common diseases such as boils, malaria, scabies, vomiting, diarrhoea and so on.
('98', 5, 5, 9, 11871) I of course believe only in nature cure.
('98', 5, 5, 10, 11912) But these women must know what the disease is, what diet is to be given and how sponging, enema, etc., have to be given.
('98', 5, 5, 11, 12033) All this is of course covered under Nayee Talim.
('98', 5, 6, 12, 12082) Q. Now that we have our own Government, should we accept assistance from the Government?
('98', 5, 6, 13, 12171) For instance scholarships?
('98', 5, 7, 14, 12198) G. This, as in the case of the previous question, is a matter of individual discretion.
('98', 5, 7, 15, 12286) But I hold the view that we should not alter the policy we have adopted so far.
('98', 5, 7, 16, 12366) People everywhere seem to have become unconcerned and imagine that since now we have our own Government there is no harm in accepting grants.
('98', 5, 7, 17, 12508) But our Government has been there for barely five months, and in this brief period it has had to carry enormous burdens.
('98', 5, 7, 18, 12629) The financial plight of the Government today is far from easy and we must not make it more difficult by burdening it further, nor should the Government involve itself in the question.
('98', 5, 7, 19, 12813) This much relief can certainly be expected with our own Government in power, viz., that workers, both men and women, working in the Kasturba Trust and other national institutions, will not have to face the difficulties they did under the British rule.
('98', 5, 8, 20, 13065) Q. If the sevikas who have received training start working for the
('98', 5, 9, 21, 13132) Communist Party, what should one do?
('98', 5, 9, 22, 13169) Should one ask them to refund the expenses incurred on their training?
('98', 5, 9, 23, 13240) Again, if women from the Communist Party or the Socialist Party request for training being given to them, should they be given the training?
('98', 5, 9, 24, 13381) And should we take in trainees recommended by the Government?
('98', 5, 10, 25, 13443) 1 Women workers
('98', 6, 0, 1, 13459) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 7
('98', 6, 1, 2, 13504) G. It cannot of course be a happy situation if we train workers and are then denied the benefit of their services.
('98', 6, 1, 3, 13619) But we must not be disappointed.
('98', 6, 1, 4, 13652) If the Government sends us trainees and pays their expenses we must give them the training.
('98', 6, 1, 5, 13744) And we must emphatically tell the trainees that courtesy demands that they observe the conditions that go with the training.
('98', 6, 1, 6, 13869) We must not worry which is a trainee follows, or which party she comes from.
('98', 6, 1, 7, 13946) We must be satisfied if she signs the pledge and follows the rules.
('98', 6, 1, 8, 14014) This is not a sectarian organization or a party organization.
('98', 6, 1, 9, 14076) It is an institution of service.
('98', 6, 1, 10, 14109) We should not seek Government grants.
('98', 6, 1, 11, 14147) We have to train women village workers for the revival of the villages.
('98', 6, 2, 12, 14219) Q. Should we have prayers in the training institutions?
('98', 6, 2, 13, 14275) G. Certainly, prayers we must have.
('98', 6, 2, 14, 14311) In fact I hold that prayers must become a part of life.
('98', 6, 2, 15, 14367) It is so with me.
('98', 6, 2, 16, 14385) Prayer is the food of the soul.
('98', 6, 2, 17, 14417) It is the broom to sweep away all the dirt from the mind.
('98', 6, 2, 18, 14475) And the women getting instructions in the camp should as a matter of etiquette present themselves for prayers at the appointed time.
('98', 6, 2, 19, 14608) Whether they are believers or non believers, whether they have faith in prayers or not, they must attend the prayers.
('98', 6, 2, 20, 14726) It cannot be without its effects.

('98', 6, 6, 24, 14830) NEW DELHI, December 7, 1947
('98', 6, 7, 25, 14858) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, Today I wish to talk to you about a very complicated matter, which is also rather sensitive.
('98', 6, 7, 26, 14973) It has appeared in the newspapers.
('98', 6, 7, 27, 15008) You will have seen that yesterday some Hindu women workers went to Lahore and met some Muslim women there.
('98', 6, 7, 28, 15115) 1 They discussed the
('98', 6, 8, 29, 15136) 1 An Inter Dominion Conference was held in Lahore on December 6, to consider ways and means for the restoration of abducted women.
('98', 6, 8, 30, 15267) A joint appeal to the people of Pakistan and India to restore all abducted women was made by the representatives at the Conference.
('98', 6, 8, 31, 15399) Prominent among the signatories to the appeal were: Ghazanfar Ali, Iftikhar Hussain Khan of Mamdot, Begum Liaquat Ali Khan, Begum Shah Nawaz, Begum Bashir Ahmed, Iftikhar ud din, K. C. Neogy, Swaran Singh, Rameshwari Nehru, Mridula Sarabhai and Kamaladevi Chattopadyaya.
('98', 7, 0, 1, 15670) 8 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 7, 1, 2, 15710) question of what ought to be done about the Hindu women abducted by Muslims in Pakistan and the Muslim women abducted by Hindus and Sikhs in East Punjab.
('98', 7, 1, 3, 15864) A very large number of Muslims have already left India and it is possible some more may yet leave.
('98', 7, 1, 4, 15963) We should now resolve that not a single Muslim will be compelled to leave.
('98', 7, 1, 5, 16038) If they voluntarily opt for Pakistan that is a different matter.
('98', 7, 1, 6, 16103) But the fact is that no one wants voluntarily to leave India.
('98', 7, 1, 7, 16165) Why should anyone want to give up one’s house and property?
('98', 7, 1, 8, 16225) It is not as if they had houses and properties waiting for them in Pakistan.
('98', 7, 1, 9, 16302) Those voluntarily opting for Pakistan or going for the sake of jobs are very few, which is natural because there are not enough jobs for them in Pakistan.
('98', 7, 1, 10, 16457) And if their established businesses in India are not affected, there is no reason for them to go.
('98', 7, 1, 11, 16555) But what of the women?
('98', 7, 1, 12, 16578) This is a complicated question.
('98', 7, 1, 13, 16610) Some say that about 12,000 women had been abducted by Hindus and Sikhs and twice that number had been abducted by Muslims in Pakistan.
('98', 7, 1, 14, 16745) Some others say that this estimate is too low.
('98', 7, 1, 15, 16792) I would say 12,000 is not a small number.
('98', 7, 1, 16, 16834) Why, a thousand, or even one, is not a small number.
('98', 7, 1, 17, 16887) Why should even a single woman be abducted?
('98', 7, 1, 18, 16931) It is barbaric for a Hindu woman to be abducted by a Muslim or a Muslim woman to be abducted by a Hindu or a Sikh.
('98', 7, 1, 19, 17046) Some people believe that 12,000 represents a very conservative figure.
('98', 7, 1, 20, 17117) Let us say that 12.000 is women had been abducted by Muslims of Pakistan and another 12,000 women had been abducted by Hindus and Sikhs of East Punjab.
('98', 7, 1, 21, 17269) The problem is how to recover them.
('98', 7, 1, 22, 17305) The women workers had been to Pakistan to consider how to solve this problem.
('98', 7, 1, 23, 17383) The Hindu and Sikh women carried away by force should be restored to their families.
('98', 7, 1, 24, 17468) Similarly the Muslim women taken away should be restored to theirs.
('98', 7, 1, 25, 17536) This task should not be left to the families of the women.
('98', 7, 1, 26, 17595) It should be our charge.
('98', 7, 1, 27, 17620) They also met Ghazanfar Ali 1 and a police officer whose name I forget.
('98', 7, 1, 28, 17692) Mridulabehn 2 and Rameshwaribehn 3, who had been to Lahore, both gave me separate reports and told me that they discussed
('98', 7, 2, 29, 17814) 1 Minister in charge of Relief and Rehabilitation in Pakistan; he had suggested at the Conference that a joint organization of the Dominions of India and Pakistan should be formed for the restoration of kidnapped women and children to their families.

('98', 8, 1, 2, 18368) the question of how abducted women should be recovered.
('98', 8, 1, 3, 18424) Obviously it will not do to send police parties or armed units as an escort for these women.
('98', 8, 1, 4, 18517) Of course some Hindu and Sikh women workers could go to Pakistan accompanied by police officers from East Punjab to bring back the abducted women.
('98', 8, 1, 5, 18664) But this is not being done.
('98', 8, 1, 6, 18692) It is said that the women concerned do not now want to return, but still they have to be brought back.
('98', 8, 1, 7, 18795) Muslim women similarly have to be taken back to Pakistan.
('98', 8, 1, 8, 18853) It is also said that the Sikh and Hindu women concerned have embraced Islam and married their Muslim abductors.
('98', 8, 1, 9, 18965) It could be true.
('98', 8, 1, 10, 18983) Bat I do not admit that they are not willing to return.
('98', 8, 1, 11, 19039) Similar is the case of Muslim women in India.
('98', 8, 1, 12, 19085) We have become barbarous in our behaviour.
('98', 8, 1, 13, 19128) It is true of East Punjab as well as of West Purjab.
('98', 8, 1, 14, 19181) It is meaningless to ask which of them is more barbaric.
('98', 8, 1, 15, 19238) Barbarity has no degrees.
('98', 8, 1, 16, 19264) Raja Gazanfar Ali says that both parties have indulged in atrocious behaviour.
('98', 8, 1, 17, 19343) It is not necessary to ask who has been more guilty.
('98', 8, 1, 18, 19396) Atrocities have taken place on a mass scale and it is irrelevant who took the first step.
('98', 8, 1, 19, 19486) The need is for women who have been abducted and harassed to be taken back to their homes.
('98', 8, 1, 20, 19577) It is my belief that the police cannot do this.
('98', 8, 1, 21, 19625) The army cannot do this.
('98', 8, 1, 22, 19650) Yes, a team of women workers could be sent to East Punjab and another team to West Punjab but I do not think that would be effective.
('98', 8, 1, 23, 19784) I can say as a man of experience that this is not the way to do this work.
('98', 8, 1, 24, 19859) This is a task for the Governments to tackle.
('98', 8, 1, 25, 19905) I am not saying that the Governments were behind the abductions.
('98', 8, 1, 26, 19970) It was not the Government of East Punjab which organized abductions.
('98', 8, 1, 27, 20039) In East Punjab Hindus and Sikhs were responsible for them and in West Punjab Muslims were responsible.
('98', 8, 1, 28, 20142) What further investigation is required?
('98', 8, 1, 29, 20182) Whatever the number—I put it at 12,000 at least—East Punjab and West Punjab should return them.
('98', 8, 1, 30, 20278) It is being said that the families of the abducted women no longer want to receive them back.
('98', 8, 1, 31, 20372) It would be a barbarian husband or a barbarian parent who would say that he would not take back his wife or daughter.
('98', 8, 1, 32, 20490) I do not think the women concerned had done anything wrong.
('98', 8, 1, 33, 20550) They had been subjected to violence.
('98', 8, 1, 34, 20587) To put a blot on them and to say that they are no longer fit to be accepted in society is unjust.
('98', 8, 1, 35, 20685) At least this does not happen among Muslims.
('98', 8, 1, 36, 20730) At least Islam is liberal in this respect, so this is a matter that the Governments should take up.
('98', 8, 1, 37, 20830) The Governments should trace all these women.
('98', 8, 1, 38, 20876) They should be traced and restored to their families.
('98', 8, 1, 39, 20930) The police and women social
('98', 9, 0, 1, 20958) 10 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 9, 1, 2, 20999) workers cannot effectively deal with this.
('98', 9, 1, 3, 21042) The problem is difficult, which means to say that public opinion is not favourable.
('98', 9, 1, 4, 21126) You cannot say that all the 12,000 women were abducted by ruffians.
('98', 9, 1, 5, 21194) I do not think that is the case.
('98', 9, 1, 6, 21227) It is good men that have become ruffians.
('98', 9, 1, 7, 21269) People are not born as goondas; they become so under certain circumstances.
('98', 9, 1, 8, 21345) Both the Governments had been weak in this respect.
('98', 9, 1, 9, 21397) Neither Government has shown enough strength to recover the abducted women.
('98', 9, 1, 10, 21473) Had both the Governments exercised authority, what happened in East Punjab and West Punjab would not have happened.
('98', 9, 1, 11, 21589) But our independence was born only three months ago.
('98', 9, 1, 12, 21642) It is still in its infancy.
('98', 9, 1, 13, 21670) In my view Pakistan is responsible for spreading this poison.
('98', 9, 1, 14, 21732) But what good can come from apportioning responsibility?
('98', 9, 1, 15, 21789) There is only one way of saving these women and that is that the Governments should even now wake up to their responsibility, give this task the first priority and all their time and accomplish it even at the cost of their lives.
('98', 9, 1, 16, 22019) Only thus can these women be rescued.
('98', 9, 1, 17, 22057) Of course we should help the Government if it requires help.
('98', 9, 1, 18, 22118) As I told you yesterday I should not speak for more than fifteen minutes; so I end here.
('98', 9, 1, 19, 22207) Two or three minutes are still left but I shall not use them.

('98', 9, 6, 25, 22365) It would of course be best if a woman could remain unmarried her whole life.
('98', 9, 6, 26, 22442) But only one in a million would be able to do so.
('98', 9, 6, 27, 22492) Desire for marriage is a natural thing.
('98', 9, 6, 28, 22532) There is nothing to be ashamed of in it.
('98', 9, 6, 29, 22573) To believe marriage to be a fall has an adverse effect on the mind and causes harm in many other ways.
('98', 9, 6, 30, 22676) The best way is to treat marriage as a religious duty and to exercise the utmost self restraint in the married state.
('98', 9, 6, 31, 22794) The householder’s state is one of the four states of Varnashrama.
('98', 9, 6, 32, 22860) The other three states depend on it.
('98', 9, 6, 33, 22897) But these days marriage has become a means of indulgence and that has led to terrible consequences.
('98', 9, 6, 34, 22997) Women should regard the duties of the householder’s state as
('98', 10, 0, 1, 23058) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 11
('98', 10, 1, 2, 23104) religious duties and live accordingly.
('98', 10, 1, 3, 23143) Personally I believe the if we give thought to it and live the householder's life with the same strict discipline which a sannyasi follows, we would find that a householder's path is much harder to follow than becoming a sannyasi, that it is a path full of thorns.
('98', 10, 1, 4, 23408) But a rosebush is full of thorns and yet when the roses bloom in the midst of those thorns, the whole bush looks grand.
('98', 10, 1, 5, 23528) We should strive to reach the condition of the rosebush.
('98', 10, 1, 6, 23585) 1 Hence we should marry not with the motive of physical pleasure but to cultivate self control and bring lustre to the householder's dharma.
('98', 10, 1, 7, 23726) That will immensely increase our capacity for service.
('98', 10, 1, 8, 23781) If a woman filled with such a spirit of service chooses as partner a man with similar feelings, the united power of service of the two could benefit the country many more times than the service of either of them singly.
('98', 10, 1, 9, 24001) Similarly, if the householder's life, as I have said, is a religious duty, motherhood automatically becomes one.
('98', 10, 1, 10, 24114) That duty is much more arduous.
('98', 10, 1, 11, 24146) In order to fulfil it, the couple should practise self control and bring forth progeny with a due sense of religious and moral responsibility.
('98', 10, 1, 12, 24289) For that, women should know the rules of physical, mental and spiritual hygiene.
('98', 10, 1, 13, 24370) The woman who presents the country with healthy, vigorous and well brought up children also serves the country.
('98', 10, 1, 14, 24482) If the couple have the spirit of service in them, their children are bound to be influenced by it and will themselves take up work of service when they grow up.
('98', 10, 1, 15, 24643) The point I wish to make is that those who are inspired by a total spirit of service will serve under all conditions.
('98', 10, 1, 16, 24761) If the couple do not live their life in the spirit of service, they will be nothing but imposters.
('98', 10, 1, 17, 24860) Their having been married will then have no meaning.
('98', 10, 1, 18, 24913) The argument that after marriage no work of service is possible has no substance.
('98', 10, 1, 19, 24995) It depends entirely on the marrying couple.
('98', 10, 1, 20, 25039) As my explanation shows, marriage puts the partners to a severe test but also helps them to render service.

('98', 11, 2, 3, 25472) December 8, 1947 To live, man primarily requires two things food and clothing.
('98', 11, 2, 4, 25551) And the means of solving the problem are simple.
('98', 11, 2, 5, 25600) One way is to accept gifts.
('98', 11, 2, 6, 25628) But begging never helps the poor to solve their problem.
('98', 11, 2, 7, 25685) On the contrary, they lose their spirit and become weak and indolent.
('98', 11, 2, 8, 25755) Another way is to take up a job.
('98', 11, 2, 9, 25788) But service, too, does not make one self reliant.
('98', 11, 2, 10, 25838) The third way is to produce the things one needs.
('98', 11, 2, 11, 25888) There are two means of doing that the charkha and the mill.
('98', 11, 2, 12, 25948) Through mills we can produce cloth on a large scale and become self sufficient as a community but not as individuals.
('98', 11, 2, 13, 26066) There is talk about a third world war.
('98', 11, 2, 14, 26105) If a third world war breaks out, it is doubtful whether we shall not be dragged into it.
('98', 11, 2, 15, 26194) But I leave that question aside, though I can say with confidence that if India only makes up her mind, not only can she keep herself away from war but she has the strength to prove to the world the futility of war.
('98', 11, 2, 16, 26410) But today while brother is cutting brother’s throat in our own country, with what face can I promise that?
('98', 11, 2, 17, 26517) I therefore leave that question aside for the present.
('98', 11, 2, 18, 26572) But if unfortunately for the country it is attacked by bombs, the first targets will be the mills and not the homes where the charkha is plied.
('98', 11, 2, 19, 26716) If, when the mills are razed to the ground as a result of the bombing, the charkha and the takli are plying, we shall not feel helpless and the world will see that though India’s mills had been reduced to ashes, she was still standing on her feet.

('98', 12, 2, 3, 27534) A correspondent says in substance:
('98', 12, 3, 4, 27569) Individual ahimsa I can understand.
('98', 12, 3, 5, 27605) Corporate ahimsa between friends is also intelligible.
('98', 12, 3, 6, 27660) But you talk of ahimsa towards avowed enemies.
('98', 12, 3, 7, 27707) This is like a mirage.
('98', 12, 3, 8, 27730) It will be a mercy if you give up this obstinacy of yours.
('98', 12, 3, 9, 27789) If you do not, you will forfeit the esteem you enjoy.
('98', 12, 3, 10, 27843) What is worse, you, being considered a Mahatma, mislead many credulous persons to their own and
('98', 12, 4, 11, 27939) society’s harm.
('98', 12, 4, 12, 27955) That non violence which only an individual can use is not of much use in terms of society.
('98', 12, 4, 13, 28046) Man is a social being.
('98', 12, 4, 14, 28069) His accomplishments to be of use must be such as any person with sufficient diligence can attain.
('98', 12, 4, 15, 28167) That which can be exercised only among friends is of value only as a spark of non violence.
('98', 12, 4, 16, 28259) It cannot merit the appellation of ahimsa.
('98', 12, 4, 17, 28302) “Enmity vanishes before ahimsa”, is a great aphorism.
('98', 12, 4, 18, 28356) It means that the greatest enmity requires an equal measure of ahimsa for its abatement.
('98', 12, 4, 19, 28445) Cultivation of this virtue may need long practice, even extending to several births.
('98', 12, 4, 20, 28530) It does not become useless on that account.
('98', 12, 4, 21, 28574) Travelling along the route, the pilgrim will meet richer experiences from day to day so that he may have a glimpse of the beauty he is destined to see at the top.
('98', 12, 4, 22, 28737) This will add to his zest.
('98', 12, 4, 23, 28764) No one is entitled to infer from this that the path will be a continuous carpet of roses without thorns.
('98', 12, 4, 24, 28869) A poet 2 has sung that the way to reach God accrues only to the very brave, never to the fainthearted.
('98', 12, 4, 25, 28972) The atmosphere today is so much saturated with poison that one refuses to recollect the wisdom of the ancients and to perceive the varied little experiences of ahimsa in action.
('98', 12, 4, 26, 29150) “A bad turn is neutralized by a good”, is a wise saying of daily experience in practice.
('98', 12, 4, 27, 29239) Why can we not see that if the sum total of the world’s activities was destructive, it would have come to an end long ago?
('98', 12, 4, 28, 29362) Love, otherwise ahimsa, sustains this planet of ours.
('98', 12, 4, 29, 29416) This much must be admitted.
('98', 12, 4, 30, 29444) The precious grace of life has to be strenuously cultivated, naturally so because it is uplifting.
('98', 12, 4, 31, 29543) Descent is easy, not so ascent.
('98', 12, 4, 32, 29575) A large majority of us being undisciplined, our daily experience is that of fighting or swearing at one another on the slightest pretext.

('98', 13, 5, 6, 30040) A Muslim organization has cautioned me against taking at face value anything said to me whether by a Hindu or a Muslim and making it the basis of an argument.
('98', 13, 5, 7, 30199) It suggests that I had better investigate the matter first and then decide what to do and it adds that I should personally visit Kathiawar and see things for myself.
('98', 13, 5, 8, 30365) I have already said that this is a thing I cannot at present undertake.
('98', 13, 5, 9, 30437) I should do what I can remaining in and around Delhi.
('98', 13, 5, 10, 30491) Those who offer me advice forget that so far it has been possible to have the charges withdrawn.
('98', 13, 5, 11, 30588) When one wants to arrive at the truth for the sake of the truth, the result is always good.
('98', 13, 5, 12, 30680) This has been repeatedly tried.
('98', 13, 5, 13, 30712) In such matters patience and perseverance are of the utmost importance.
('98', 13, 5, 14, 30784) I keep receiving letters from Sind.
('98', 13, 5, 15, 30820) There is one from Karachi which says: “There are no killings but Hindus cannot live here with honour and dignity.
('98', 13, 5, 16, 30934) The Muslims who have gone there from India can enter any Hindu homes at will and announce their intention to stay there.
('98', 13, 5, 17, 31055) They have no authority, but we dare not say no to them.
('98', 13, 5, 18, 31111) There had been innumerable incidents of this kind.
('98', 13, 5, 19, 31162) The Karachi of a few months ago has become a thing of dreams.” This is the substance of the letter which is very long.
('98', 13, 5, 20, 31281) What the letter says can, I feel, be believed.
('98', 13, 5, 21, 31328) It means that there is total anarchy there.
('98', 13, 5, 22, 31372) This is the way of killing people slowly.
('98', 13, 5, 23, 31414) There is also such a thing as killing souls.
('98', 13, 5, 24, 31459) I appeal to Pakistan to stop this lawlessness.
('98', 13, 5, 25, 31506) It is a disease and the sooner it is got rid of the better.
('98', 13, 5, 26, 31566) Sugar has been decontrolled.
('98', 13, 5, 27, 31595) Cereals, pulses and cloth will soon be decontrolled.
('98', 13, 5, 28, 31648) The purpose of decontrol is not to bring down the prices all at once.
('98', 13, 5, 29, 31718) The purpose for the present is to make our life natural.
('98', 13, 5, 30, 31775) Controls imposed from above are always bad.
('98', 13, 5, 31, 31819) In our country,
('98', 13, 6, 32, 31835) 1 As Gandhiji was observing silence, his written speech was read out at the prayer meeting.
('98', 14, 0, 1, 31927) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 15
('98', 14, 1, 2, 31973) this is especially so because we have a vast population spread over a country 1,900 miles long and 1,500 miles broad.
('98', 14, 1, 3, 32091) I do not take count of Pakistan here.
('98', 14, 1, 4, 32129) We are not a martial nation.
('98', 14, 1, 5, 32158) We produced, or at any rate we can produce, our own food and enough cotton for our requirements.
('98', 14, 1, 6, 32255) When controls are lifted people will have a feeling of freedom and they will also have the right to make mistakes.
('98', 14, 1, 7, 32370) This is an age old way of making progress to advance by making mistakes and rectifying them.
('98', 14, 1, 8, 32463) If you keep a child wrapped up in cottonwool it will die or become stunted.
('98', 14, 1, 9, 32539) If you want to see him grow into a strong man you will have to train him to stand every kind of weather.
('98', 14, 1, 10, 32644) Similarly if the Government deserves to be called a government it must teach people how to face shortages.
('98', 14, 1, 11, 32751) It must teach them to weather bad times by united effort.
('98', 14, 1, 12, 32809) It is no good helping them somehow to keep alive without their having to work for it.
('98', 14, 1, 13, 32895) Viewed thus, decontrol means that instead of merely a few people in the Government the millions have to learn to be farsighted.
('98', 14, 1, 14, 33023) The Government will have to assume fresh responsibilities on behalf of the people so that it can discharge its obligation towards them.
('98', 14, 1, 15, 33159) It would have to improve transport.
('98', 14, 1, 16, 33195) It would have to teach people ways of improving the yield.
('98', 14, 1, 17, 33254) In this matter the Food Ministry will have to pay more attention to small farmers than to big landlords.
('98', 14, 1, 18, 33359) The Government thus has on the one hand to trust the people as a whole and keep a watch on their occupations and on the other to keep in mind the interest of the small farmers.
('98', 14, 1, 19, 33536) So far no attention has been paid to them and yet a large majority of the population consists of them.
('98', 14, 1, 20, 33639) The peasant himself consumes what he grows.
('98', 14, 1, 21, 33683) He sells his small surplus in order to buy the other necessities of life.
('98', 14, 1, 22, 33757) One consequence of controls was that the peasant could realize only a very low price from the market for his produce.
('98', 14, 1, 23, 33875) Therefore in so far as the peasant gets a higher price for foodgrain the price of foodgrain will increase.
('98', 14, 1, 24, 33982) The consumer should not mind that.
('98', 14, 1, 25, 34017) The Government will have to see that any benefit from the rise in prices under the new arrangement goes wholly to the farmer.
('98', 14, 1, 26, 34143) This will have to be explained to the people every day or at least every week.
('98', 14, 1, 27, 34222) Millers and all kinds of middlemen will have to co operate with the Government and work under its direction.
('98', 14, 1, 28, 34331) I think this is being done.
('98', 14, 1, 29, 34359) All these various persons and organizations should work in full concord and in full co operation.
('98', 14, 1, 30, 34457) So far they have always exploited the poor.
('98', 14, 1, 31, 34501) The rivalry that has so
('98', 15, 0, 1, 34525) 16 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 15, 1, 2, 34566) marked their attitude to each other should go.
('98', 15, 1, 3, 34613) Especially in the matter of food and cloth no one should work for the sake of profit.
('98', 15, 1, 4, 34699) If decontrol leads to traders making larger profits, then the purpose of decontrol will be defeated.
('98', 15, 1, 5, 34800) Let us hope that capitalists and businessmen will offer full co operation.

('98', 16, 6, 8, 36264) BIRLA HOUSE, NEW DELHI, December 9, 1947
('98', 16, 7, 9, 36305) MAULANA SAHEB, I had a talk with Sardar Patel about the Muslims from outside who want to settle in Delhi.
('98', 16, 7, 10, 36411) He says that he has no objection to nationalist Muslims settling in Hazarat Nizamuddin if they wish, whatever their number.
('98', 16, 7, 11, 36535) But he is against bringing Muslims from outside, to be rehabilitated in the interior of Delhi in houses now evacuated.
('98', 16, 7, 12, 36654) For, if the Muslims now evacuating these houses return, where will they be accommodated?
('98', 16, 7, 13, 36743) Secondly, if Muslims from outside are rehabilitated in these houses the Hindu and Sikh refugees who cannot find accommodation are bound to object and argue that while they have not been rehabilitated outsiders are brought in for settling.
('98', 16, 7, 14, 36982) The Sardar’s view seems quite right to me.
('98', 16, 7, 15, 37025) Therefore you may bring the nationalist Muslims and help them settle in Hazarat Nizamuddin.
('98', 16, 7, 16, 37117) These outsiders should not be accommodated in the city’s interior.

('98', 16, 9, 19, 37246) 14. TALK WITH WORKERS OF KASTURBA TRUST
('98', 16, 10, 20, 37286) December 9, 1947 Only a woman should be appointed an Agent of the Kasturba Trust.
('98', 16, 10, 21, 37368) For instance, in Assam and Utkal, no women workers are available.
('98', 16, 10, 22, 37434) We should therefore do without Agents there.
('98', 16, 10, 23, 37479) But having regard to the aims of the Trust, men should not be employed as Agents.
('98', 16, 10, 24, 37561) If today we employ them as Agents, tomorrow we shall be tempted to employ them in other capacities too.
('98', 16, 10, 25, 37665) The Turst’s object is to find ways and means to uplift the women and children of villages.
('98', 16, 10, 26, 37756) I do not want the Trust merely to run hospitals.
('98', 16, 10, 27, 37805) We must explain
('98', 17, 0, 1, 37821) 18 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 17, 1, 2, 37862) the meaning of freedom to the women in the seven lakh villages of India.
('98', 17, 1, 3, 37935) We should explain to them the duties and not the rights of a woman as mother, sister and daughter in a free country.
('98', 17, 1, 4, 38052) If we talk about rights, that will increase mutual distrust and strife.
('98', 17, 1, 5, 38124) If they understand their duties, they will automatically understand their rights.
('98', 17, 1, 6, 38206) For instance, if a girl is born, the parents ask what need there is to educate her, and sell her off when she grows up.
('98', 17, 1, 7, 38326) We should try to eradicate such wrong ideas and evil practices.
('98', 17, 1, 8, 38390) If a girl of 20 is sold or married off to an old man of 60 or 70, what is the duty of the girl as a wife?
('98', 17, 1, 9, 38496) A girl of 20 cannot be said to be a mere child.
('98', 17, 1, 10, 38544) If such a girl has been educated by the Trust, she can very humbly and respectfully tell her husband that she looked upon him as her father and she serves him as such.
('98', 17, 1, 11, 38712) She can tell him that her parents had married her to him in their ignorance, but she would treat him as her father.
('98', 17, 1, 12, 38828) In this way she can adopt the path of service.
('98', 17, 1, 13, 38875) QUESTION.
('98', 17, 1, 14, 38885) If a woman is violated and a child is born, what should she do?
('98', 17, 1, 15, 38949) GANDHIJI.
('98', 17, 1, 16, 38959) If this happens, the woman should feel ashamed of herself.
('98', 17, 1, 17, 39018) I would not call it violation.
('98', 17, 1, 18, 39049) The woman does have a share in it.
('98', 17, 1, 19, 39084) Still, however, if she kills the child, her sin will be even greater.
('98', 17, 1, 20, 39154) What she can do to expiate the sin is to bring up the child.
('98', 17, 1, 21, 39215) After all, what crime has the child committed?
('98', 17, 1, 22, 39262) In Nadiad they had placed a box in which a woman could put her new born baby so that the mother could escape social obloquy and the child’s life might be saved.
('98', 17, 1, 23, 39423) I must confess that I do not approve of this method.
('98', 17, 1, 24, 39476) It encourages moral looseness in men and women.
('98', 17, 1, 25, 39524) If along with innocent women morally loose women also follow the same way, you should arouse a feeling among the women that such action is shameful.
('98', 17, 1, 26, 39673) However, though such women should feel ashamed of themselves, to have the child is the utmost limit of cruelty.
('98', 17, 1, 27, 39785) Even cruelty must have some limits.

('98', 17, 5, 31, 39894) NEW DELHI, December 9, 1947
('98', 17, 6, 32, 39922) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, Today I attended a meeting of the Trustees of the A.I.S.A. and naturally I had to speak for half an hour to the women.
('98', 18, 0, 1, 40063) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 19
('98', 18, 1, 2, 40109) have the time—for I shall be finishing the speech in 15 minutes —I shall tell you about that today.
('98', 18, 1, 3, 40209) Otherwise I shall do so tomorrow.
('98', 18, 1, 4, 40243) You will have seen in the papers today a report saying that Sardar Patel and I are going to Pilani.
('98', 18, 1, 5, 40343) For a change of air.
('98', 18, 1, 6, 40364) It is a mere canard.
('98', 18, 1, 7, 40385) I do not know what the Sardar has in mind but I certainly know that this is not the time to seek a change of air.
('98', 18, 1, 8, 40499) The Sardar works all day long and rests at night and that is all the change of air he gets.
('98', 18, 1, 9, 40591) The same applies to me.
('98', 18, 1, 10, 40615) It is true that I am not so overworked because I do not have to run a government.
('98', 18, 1, 11, 40697) But I receive many visitors and I get tired.
('98', 18, 1, 12, 40742) Therefore I have to give myself rest.
('98', 18, 1, 13, 40780) The air is quite congenial in Delhi at present and there is no need to go out for a change of air.
('98', 18, 1, 14, 40879) What can Pilani offer?
('98', 18, 1, 15, 40902) So far as I am concerned I have taken a pledge to do or die.
('98', 18, 1, 16, 40963) I have not fulfilled that pledge.
('98', 18, 1, 17, 40997) I cannot understand why newspapers publish such rumours.
('98', 18, 1, 18, 41054) I can only conclude that a large part of what the newspapers put out consists of falsehoods.
('98', 18, 1, 19, 41147) Then I came to know—though not from newspapers—that since we are going there certain directives have come from Jaipur about the quantity of sugar, wheat and other provisions that we shall be needing.
('98', 18, 1, 20, 41347) Although we are only two persons to be provided for, a scarcity seems to have been created in the market.
('98', 18, 1, 21, 41453) It is of course only hearsay.
('98', 18, 1, 22, 41483) If true it reveals a shocking state of affairs that our movements should influence the market.
('98', 18, 1, 23, 41578) It is as though we lived only in order to eat or that we had large retinues following us.
('98', 18, 1, 24, 41668) This should not be so.
('98', 18, 1, 25, 41691) The Sardar is a poor man, and so am I. It is true that he lives in a palatial house; so do I at present.
('98', 18, 1, 26, 41796) Of course the best thing would have been for him and for me to live in a mud hut.
('98', 18, 1, 27, 41878) Anyway, what I was trying to tell you is about the way rumours are spread.
('98', 18, 1, 28, 41953) After all I am available here.
('98', 18, 1, 29, 41984) They might have asked me if I planned to go to Pilani.
('98', 18, 1, 30, 42039) I now have a telegram from the Associated Press in this connection which hurts me even more.
('98', 18, 1, 31, 42132) The Sardar is always busy but they should have asked me whether we are going.
('98', 18, 1, 32, 42210) I have a letter from a friend from Sind.
('98', 18, 1, 33, 42251) He has given his name but I shall not disclose it though he would not mind my doing so.
('98', 18, 1, 34, 42339) I had told you about a letter from a doctor in Sind who had reported the hardships of the Sind Harijans.
('98', 18, 1, 35, 42444) 1 The doctor has been arrested.
('98', 18, 1, 36, 42476) Whether he was arrested because he wrote to me or for some other
('98', 18, 2, 37, 42541) 1 Vide “Speech at Prayer Meeting”, 3 12 1947.
('98', 19, 0, 1, 42587) 20 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 19, 1, 2, 42628) reason I do not know.
('98', 19, 1, 3, 42650) Many persons who served Harijans have been arrested.
('98', 19, 1, 4, 42703) This is the kind of thing that is happening in Sind.
('98', 19, 1, 5, 42756) I admit that people are not being murdered, but as I told you yesterday this is worse than murder.
('98', 19, 1, 6, 42855) When you murder a man he is dead and everyone then puts up with the fact, but to harass people and kill them by inches is much worse.
('98', 19, 1, 7, 42989) A man was arrested and then released—maybe they will release others too.
('98', 19, 1, 8, 43062) But it is bad to arrest people like this.
('98', 19, 1, 9, 43104) I do not wish to make accusations against the Pakistan Government but I must warn them that if they keep arresting Harijan workers in this way it will be impossible for the workers to continue to stay in Sind.
('98', 19, 1, 10, 43314) The same is true of Harijans.
('98', 19, 1, 11, 43344) This sort of thing was common during the British rule.
('98', 19, 1, 12, 43399) Must we continue the same practice?
('98', 19, 1, 13, 43435) I still have a few minutes, so I shall tell you about another matter, viz., about the women.
('98', 19, 1, 14, 43528) The Kasturba Memorial Trust has been set up because there are 700,000 villages in India and women and children living in them must be served.
('98', 19, 1, 15, 43670) But there is a larger issue confronting us; a large number of Hindu and Sikh women have been abducted by Muslims and an equally large number of Muslim women have been abducted by Hindus and Sikhs.
('98', 19, 1, 16, 43867) Leave aside the question which community has abducted more women.
('98', 19, 1, 17, 43933) In any case under each of the two Governments no less than 12,000 women and girls have been abducted.
('98', 19, 1, 18, 44035) What is the Kasturba Trust to do?
('98', 19, 1, 19, 44069) I shall do what lies in my power.
('98', 19, 1, 20, 44103) One thing is obvious, that we cannot take up this work to advertise ourselves.
('98', 19, 1, 21, 44182) Those who are public servants have to do the work of service.
('98', 19, 1, 22, 44244) Once the work is over there is an end to it.
('98', 19, 1, 23, 44289) It is of no importance whether the matter is reported in the newspapers or not.
('98', 19, 1, 24, 44369) Again, we have to consider the various things that should be done for women.
('98', 19, 1, 25, 44446) I can suggest a few things.
('98', 19, 1, 26, 44474) Most women workers we have are from the cities.
('98', 19, 1, 27, 44522) We could find a few in villages and even these had some connection with cities.
('98', 19, 1, 28, 44602) I do not say that it is bad, that it is wrong to have anything to do with cities.
('98', 19, 1, 29, 44684) But for the last 150 years the trend has been for cities to exist only to squeeze wealth out of the villages.
('98', 19, 1, 30, 44794) They took raw material from the villages, carried on trade with foreign countries and made crores of rupees.
('98', 19, 1, 31, 44903) This money did not go to the villagers, or only a very small fraction of it did.
('98', 19, 1, 32, 44984) The bulk of it went to millionaires and the mill owners.
('98', 19, 1, 33, 45041) Towns exist to exploit the villages.
('98', 19, 1, 34, 45078) The city culture does not therefore fit into the framework of villages.
('98', 19, 1, 35, 45150) A woman worker from a town should not carry to the villages the atmosphere and the ways of towns.
('98', 19, 1, 36, 45248) Maybe she has a lot of money and articles of luxury.
('98', 19, 1, 37, 45301) Maybe she has a motor car, cosmetics, dresses of
('98', 20, 0, 1, 45350) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 21
('98', 20, 1, 2, 45396) velvet and toothpastes, foreign or indigenous, tooth brushes, dainty shoes and sandals.
('98', 20, 1, 3, 45484) If she takes all these things along with her, how can she serve the villages?
('98', 20, 1, 4, 45562) If with these things she sets the standard for the villagers they will devour the villages.
('98', 20, 1, 5, 45654) The cities should be for increasing the prosperity of the villages, for making money available to them for developing the village culture.
('98', 20, 1, 6, 45793) But what is happening is the very opposite of this.
('98', 20, 1, 7, 45845) I cannot explain to you everything.
('98', 20, 1, 8, 45881) All I have to say is that the women workers who truly want to serve, not to exploit, must have a sense of propriety and take to the villages only the things that it would be appropriate to take.
('98', 20, 1, 9, 46076) Such reforms as they wish to introduce must be in conformity with the genius of the villages.
('98', 20, 1, 10, 46170) If that happens our seven lakh villages which today are in a sunken state can come up.
('98', 20, 1, 11, 46257) The villages are not inhabited by uncivilized people with no art and nothing good to show in life.
('98', 20, 1, 12, 46356) There is much beauty in the villages.
('98', 20, 1, 13, 46394) There is much art and there are industries that the whole world knows about.
('98', 20, 1, 14, 46471) Village crafts have been appreciated all over the world.
('98', 20, 1, 15, 46528) Therefore the women workers who would serve villages must leave behind the things associated with city life.
('98', 20, 1, 16, 46637) They should take with them only what is good and moral.
('98', 20, 1, 17, 46693) Then alone can they help in the uplift of the millions of our women and children.
('98', 20, 1, 18, 46775) This much at any rate let us do.

('98', 20, 5, 23, 46898) Q. Why does Gandhiji resort to a fast when he faces extreme difficulties?
('98', 20, 5, 24, 46972) What is the effect of this action on the life of the public of India?
('98', 20, 6, 25, 47042) A. Such a question has been put to me before but never, perhaps, precisely in the same terms.
('98', 20, 6, 26, 47136) The answer, however, is easy.
('98', 20, 6, 27, 47166) It is the last weapon in the armoury of the votary of ahimsa.
('98', 20, 6, 28, 47228) When human ingenuity fails, the votary fasts.
('98', 20, 6, 29, 47274) This fasting quickens the spirit of prayer, that is to say, the fasting is a spiritual act and, therefore, addressed to God.
('98', 20, 6, 30, 47399) The effect of such action on the life of the people is that when the person fasting is at all known to them their sleeping conscience is awakened.
('98', 20, 6, 31, 47546) But there is the danger that the people through mistaken sympathy may act against their will in order to save
('98', 21, 0, 1, 47656) 22 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 21, 1, 2, 47697) the life of the loved one.
('98', 21, 1, 3, 47724) This danger has got to be faced.
('98', 21, 1, 4, 47757) One ought not to be deterred from right action when one is sure of the rightness.
('98', 21, 1, 5, 47839) It can but promote circumspection.
('98', 21, 1, 6, 47874) Such a fast is undertaken in obedience to the dictates of the inner voice and, therefore, prevents haste.

('98', 21, 5, 10, 48050) A correspondent writes to the effect that: Even after independence, the hold of the English language on the city people does not seem to have relaxed to any appreciable extent.
('98', 21, 5, 11, 48227) In proof of his statement he cites the Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition held in Bombay, at which the opener’s speech was in English, the signboards were painted in English and the corres pondence for the most part was conducted in English.
('98', 21, 5, 12, 48473) The ration cards are in English, much to the annoyance of the general public, who cannot read English.
('98', 21, 5, 13, 48576) Our leaders feel that their important pronouncements must be made in English without the slightest regard for the poor public.
('98', 21, 5, 14, 48703) This is a just complaint, demanding peremptory redress.
('98', 21, 5, 15, 48759) The unfortunate inertia has to be thrown out before a visible change for the better takes place in this important matter.

('98', 21, 10, 20, 48989) You must know that the people here and even in a greater measure the members of the Union Government do not have that trust in you that I have.

('98', 22, 1, 3, 49458) If you wish to remove their distrust and suspicion, you must have the courage plainly to tell Jinnah and Liaquat Ali that they must adopt a uniform policy with the Indian Union in regard to the recovery of the abducted women and other matters pertaining to the minorities.
('98', 22, 1, 4, 49731) Similarly, you must ascertain the truth about what is said to be happening in Karachi and ask Jinnah how it comports with his declaration that the minorities in Pakistan would be fully protected.
('98', 22, 1, 5, 49927) And if you cut no ice with them, you must, as a Muslim and an Indian national, issue a statement disapproving of Pakistan’s policy in unequivocal terms.
('98', 22, 1, 6, 50080) Thereby you will serve both India and Pakistan.

('98', 22, 4, 9, 50208) BIRLA HOUSE, NEW DELHI, December 10, 1947
('98', 22, 5, 10, 50250) Students, parents and teachers should all become proficient in crafts.
('98', 22, 5, 11, 50321) only by imparting education through crafts can India stand before the world.
('98', 22, 5, 12, 50398) Just as there are laboratories in schools, our kitchens should be our laboratories.
('98', 22, 5, 13, 50482) For instance germinated pulses are rich in vitamins, but when we cook them with spices all the vitamins are destroyed.
('98', 22, 5, 14, 50601) How much heat and how much time will food require to cook so that it is easily digested and also preserves vitamins?
('98', 22, 5, 15, 50718) How much food in calories will a child, a student, a grown up man, a moneyed man, a worker or a common man require?
('98', 22, 5, 16, 50834) How much ghee, oil, milk or grain should one consume?
('98', 22, 5, 17, 50888) If all this is taught to the students while cooking, they would become experts in the science of nutrition.
('98', 22, 5, 18, 50996) There is similarly a science in the charkha as also in nursing the sick.
('98', 22, 5, 19, 51069) Today boys of twenty become graduates and can speak a foreign language as fluently as their mother tongue.
('98', 22, 5, 20, 51176) Although history, geography, arithmetic, geometry, Sanskrit, etc., are taught through a
('98', 22, 6, 21, 51264) 1 A group of local Muslims called on Gandhiji soon after.
('98', 22, 6, 22, 51322) He gave them similar advice that they should set forth their views in a public statement if they felt that the minorities in Pakistan were not getting a fair deal and boldly and unequivocally say that this was a disgrace to Pakistan and a stigma on Islam.
('98', 23, 0, 1, 51578) 24 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 23, 1, 2, 51619) foreign language they pass the examinations.
('98', 23, 1, 3, 51664) This shows that our boys are not dull or incompetent.
('98', 23, 1, 4, 51718) I tell you that no English or other foreign students can speak Hindustani or Gujarati however hard they may try, as fluently as our students can speak English.
('98', 23, 1, 5, 51878) I know of many Englishmen who have been here for years and who have been trying to learn Hindi and yet even now they cannot pronounce the word rqe [you], they pronounce it Vqe.
('98', 23, 1, 6, 52055) Look at Mirabehn.
('98', 23, 1, 7, 52073) No one could be more hard working.
('98', 23, 1, 8, 52108) She resents it if she is introduced as an English woman.
('98', 23, 1, 9, 52165) She lives and serves as a daughter of India.
('98', 23, 1, 10, 52210) She still cannot properly pronounce the sound ‘r’ of Hindustani.
('98', 23, 1, 11, 52275) But we must not be content with getting degrees in English.
('98', 23, 1, 12, 52335) We must learn hygiene, chemistry, economics, etc.
('98', 23, 1, 13, 52385) And that not through books but through crafts.
('98', 23, 1, 14, 52432) Students should diligently acquire knowledge.
('98', 23, 1, 15, 52478) When there is knowledge to be found in cooking, in disease, in recreations, what need is there to pore over books?
('98', 23, 1, 16, 52593) If you take chillies in excess you will get dysentery.
('98', 23, 1, 17, 52648) So from this we can gain knowledge about the cause of dysentery.
('98', 23, 1, 18, 52713) Thus we can make experiments on ourselves and gain knowledge from our experiences.
('98', 23, 1, 19, 52796) This knowledge is permanent.
('98', 23, 1, 20, 52825) Why need one cram the dates of Lord Curzon’s birth and death?
('98', 23, 1, 21, 52887) And if, even after cramming them, one forgets them at the examination one’s parents will have wasted the fee money.
('98', 23, 1, 22, 53003) Of course if one wants to study these dates because of interest in them, that is a different matter.
('98', 23, 1, 23, 53104) But today we do not need such education.
('98', 23, 1, 24, 53145) If therefore the flame of freedom is to be lighted in India the very first need is a revolution in education.
('98', 23, 1, 25, 53255) After all, students are the real wealth of the country.
('98', 23, 1, 26, 53311) Teachers, in so far as they mould the students, are the silent servants of the country.
('98', 23, 1, 27, 53399) Their profession not only earns them their bread but is also one of service.
('98', 23, 1, 28, 53476) But today we neglect those we call teachers.
('98', 23, 1, 29, 53521) Parents must take an active interest in teachers.
('98', 23, 1, 30, 53571) Parents commit a grave sin when they address teachers disrespectfully.
('98', 23, 1, 31, 53642) The teachers can impart no enlightenment to students till we learn to show towards them the same respect that we show to the priest in the temple or to our spiritual preceptor.
('98', 23, 1, 32, 53819) And if the students are not enlightened we may be certain the country will remain enveloped in darkness.
('98', 23, 1, 33, 53924) Today all this seems a fond hope.
('98', 23, 1, 34, 53958) We fought the English for so long.
('98', 23, 1, 35, 53993) People used to make fun of us and ask if we thought we would get freedom by going to jail and by being flogged.
('98', 23, 1, 36, 54105) But I had the firm conviction that freedom would come through that path alone and no other.
('98', 23, 1, 37, 54197) Similarly while today the cloud of hatred and enmity darkens the relations between brother and brother, we cannot find a way to
('98', 24, 0, 1, 54325) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 25
('98', 24, 1, 2, 54371) happiness because of our ignorance.
('98', 24, 1, 3, 54407) Ignorance has rendered us blind.
('98', 24, 1, 4, 54440) It is our misfortune that we are unable to see who is clear as day.

('98', 24, 5, 8, 54579) NEW DELHI, December 10, 1947
('98', 24, 6, 9, 54608) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, Yesterday I told you that I attended the meeting of the A. I. S. A. and addressed a few words to the women.
('98', 24, 6, 10, 54738) Today again I had to go to a meeting of the Talimi Sangh.
('98', 24, 6, 11, 54796) But maybe I shall have to leave that out for today.
('98', 24, 6, 12, 54848) I must speak today of the A. I. S. A. You know what the Spinners’ Association is.
('98', 24, 6, 13, 54930) It carries on khadi activity which is centred round the charkha.
('98', 24, 6, 14, 54995) First, the cotton has to be ginned, carded, made into slivers, and then spun and woven.
('98', 24, 6, 15, 55083) If the hundreds of millions of people in India take to this work—it is easy, we can even teach it to children—all the expenditure on cloth can be saved.
('98', 24, 6, 16, 55236) If cloth is thus manufactured in villages it becomes almost free.
('98', 24, 6, 17, 55302) And if cotton is grown in the villages the saving would be twice as much, for we would have to spend nothing on cloth and we could also benefit from the craft and prosper.
('98', 24, 6, 18, 55474) I therefore feel that if we do not behave foolishly there should be no dearth of cloth in our country.
('98', 24, 6, 19, 55577) There should be no dearth even if there is not a single textile mill left in India.
('98', 24, 6, 20, 55661) Today we have to look up to the mills.
('98', 24, 6, 21, 55700) We have forgotten the charkha and khadi.
('98', 24, 6, 22, 55741) People do certainly sport khadi caps because they have got used to it, having worn it during the struggle for freedom.
('98', 24, 6, 23, 55860) But one feels sad that khadi is not a living thing in our lives.
('98', 24, 6, 24, 55925) The Spinners’ Association has been working for many years.
('98', 24, 6, 25, 55984) It has disbursed crores of rupees and yet we are where we were.
('98', 24, 6, 26, 56048) This is a matter to be pondered over.
('98', 24, 6, 27, 56086) The charkha teaches us ahimsa.
('98', 24, 6, 28, 56117) If everybody took up the charkha the villages would become prosperous and would not present the depressing spectacle they do today.
('98', 24, 6, 29, 56249) During the discussion at the meeting, it was shown how, through the charkha and khadi, the shortage in cloth could be made good and crores of rupees could be given to the villagers, not in cash but in the saving that would be effected from not having to buy mill cloth.
('98', 24, 6, 30, 56519) It may be said that in manufacturing khadi we would have to pay for the cotton.
('98', 24, 6, 31, 56599) But the
('98', 25, 0, 1, 56607) 26 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 25, 1, 2, 56648) price of cotton would be very little.
('98', 25, 1, 3, 56686) If we use all the cotton that is today produced, it should be enough.
('98', 25, 1, 4, 56756) But the Government gives all the facilities to the mills.
('98', 25, 1, 5, 56814) It is more concerned for the capitalists than for the farmers.
('98', 25, 1, 6, 56877) It is a painful fact.
('98', 25, 1, 7, 56899) I am not against capitalists, I am myself staying in the house of a capitalist.
('98', 25, 1, 8, 56979) But I know the attitude that the capitalists have adopted.
('98', 25, 1, 9, 57038) The Government may say that they do everything for the poor.
('98', 25, 1, 10, 57099) But even the British used to say it.
('98', 25, 1, 11, 57136) The truth is that the interests of the poor are not served.
('98', 25, 1, 12, 57196) The Government should humbly accept this.
('98', 25, 1, 13, 57238) It is easy to say that the poor should be helped.
('98', 25, 1, 14, 57288) Let the ministers decide to go and live in the villages.
('98', 25, 1, 15, 57345) If they are true socialists—and if I have my way I would make them behave so—if they are true servants of the poor, not only of the workers but of the peasants who are more numerous, if they want to uplift the people, I would tell them that they should only wear khadi.
('98', 25, 1, 16, 57615) There is nothing to prevent them from producing their own khadi at home.
('98', 25, 1, 17, 57688) I will tell the people what they are doing.
('98', 25, 1, 18, 57732) Ever since I came here I have been saying this but have been able to achieve nothing.
('98', 25, 1, 19, 57818) All that I have managed to get is a few crores of rupees for the villages.
('98', 25, 1, 20, 57893) But what I want is that the music of the charkha should be heard in every home and no cloth except khadi should be seen anywhere.
('98', 25, 1, 21, 58023) If this happened the poverty prevailing in the villages would disappear.
('98', 25, 1, 22, 58096) That it has not so far happened is our misfortune.
('98', 25, 1, 23, 58147) One cannot say that in other respects things are going on well here.
('98', 25, 1, 24, 58216) There are speeches being made—I shall not name the speakers because full particulars are still lacking—that the few Muslims still remaining here will not be allowed to stay on, that the mosques still standing will be taken over to house Hindus.
('98', 25, 1, 25, 58461) What else will happen only God knows.
('98', 25, 1, 26, 58499) I think that if the Hindus occupied the mosques it would be the end of Hinduism.
('98', 25, 1, 27, 58580) So much for Delhi.
('98', 25, 1, 28, 58599) Something about Ajmer has come to our notice.
('98', 25, 1, 29, 58645) And it is the same story there.
('98', 25, 1, 30, 58677) I have visited the town many times.
('98', 25, 1, 31, 58713) It has Muslims and Hindus in large numbers.
('98', 25, 1, 32, 58757) There is an important Muslim shrine 1
('98', 25, 2, 33, 58795) It is also visited by Hindus and thus the two have been living in amity.
('98', 25, 2, 34, 58868) They are one not in religion but in their ways of life.
('98', 25, 2, 35, 58924) Not that there were no quarrels between the two communities but today the rioting has been much more serious.
('98', 25, 2, 36, 59034) It seems from what little has appeared in the newspapers that a large number of Muslims have been killed.
('98', 25, 2, 37, 59140) There was first a scare among the Muslims and those who

('98', 26, 1, 2, 59273) could ran away leaving a few behind.
('98', 26, 1, 3, 59310) Then followed the riots.
('98', 26, 1, 4, 59335) I understand that is what is happening in the villages all around.
('98', 26, 1, 5, 59402) I shall talk to you again after I have full particulars.
('98', 26, 1, 6, 59459) All I say is that it is a shameful affair.
('98', 26, 1, 7, 59502) Let us pray to God to give us the wisdom not to destroy Hinduism by our conduct.
('98', 26, 1, 8, 59583) It cannot do any good to destroy Hinduism in the process of killing Muslims.
('98', 26, 1, 9, 59660) If we wish to live we must let live.
('98', 26, 1, 10, 59697) Man was not made by God to live through killing others.
('98', 26, 1, 11, 59753) It must not be allowed to happen that the Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan and Muslims in India are killed and the rest become slaves.
('98', 26, 1, 12, 59884) We are inviting our own destruction.
('98', 26, 1, 13, 59921) There is a saying in Sanskrit: “A man loses his reason when he is to be destroyed.” 1 our minds have become perverse.
('98', 26, 1, 14, 60039) The cries of “kill, slaughter, drive out the Muslims”, are a sign of our having lost our reason.
('98', 26, 1, 15, 60136) There are many other things I want to say but I have not the time, having resolved not to speak for more than 15 minutes.

('98', 26, 4, 19, 60331) 21. WHO SHOULD BE PROVINCIAL GOVERNORS?
('98', 26, 5, 20, 60371) The following is a free translation of Principal Shriman Narayan Agrawal’s letter in Hindustani from Wardha:
('98', 26, 6, 21, 60480) In the Constitution that is being framed by the Constituent Assembly, there is to be provision for the election of provincial Governors by the majority of voters under the adult franchise system.
('98', 26, 6, 22, 60676) From this one is entitled to infer that, as a rule, the nominees of the Congress Parliamentary Board will be elected.
('98', 26, 6, 23, 60794) The Chief Minister of the province will also be of the Congress party.
('98', 26, 6, 24, 60865) Common sense dictates that the provincial Governor must be above party politics of the province concerned, or above being unduly influenced by the Chief Minister or above friction between himself and his Chief Minister.
('98', 26, 7, 25, 61085) In my opinion there is no necessity for a Governor.
('98', 26, 7, 26, 61137) The Chief Minister should be able to take his place and people’s money to the tune of Rs. 5,500 per month for the sinecure of the Governor will be saved.
('98', 26, 7, 27, 61291) Nevertheless, no provincial Governor should belong to his own province.
('98', 26, 8, 28, 61363) Moreover, in this way the expense and worry of an election by the majority of the adult population will be saved.
('98', 26, 8, 29, 61477) Will it not be proper and better
('98', 26, 9, 30, 61510) 1 : 2 A Hindi version of this appeared in Harijan Sevak, 21 12 1947.
('98', 27, 0, 1, 61579) 28 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 27, 1, 2, 61620) for the President of the Union to select Governors satisfying the reasonable test above suggested?
('98', 27, 1, 3, 61719) Such Governors will surely raise the tone of the public life of the provinces governed by them.
('98', 27, 1, 4, 61815) It is worthy of note that the present Governors have been appointed by the Central Cabinet of the Union on the above basis and, therefore, their influence on their provinces has been wholesome.
('98', 27, 1, 5, 62009) I fear that if the Governors are elected as threatened under the forthcoming Constitution, their influence is likely to be unwholesome.
('98', 27, 2, 6, 62145) Further, the Constitution as foreshadowed makes no mention of the village panchayat being the foundation of the progressive decentralization in the place of the old hunger for centralization.
('98', 27, 2, 7, 62337) There are other such defects which one can profitably point out, but I have no right or desire to enter into an elaborate criticism of our seasoned leaders.
('98', 27, 2, 8, 62494) I have but ventured to draw your attention to the defects which have appeared to me and demand your guidance.
('98', 27, 2, 9, 62604) There is much to be said in favour of the argument advanced by Principal Agrawal about the appointment of provincial Governors.
('98', 27, 2, 10, 62732) I must confess that I have not been able to follow the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly.
('98', 27, 2, 11, 62828) I do not know the context in which the proposal under discussion has been made.
('98', 27, 2, 12, 62908) But, examined in isolation, the criticism appears irresistible; with the exception that much as I would like to spare every pice of the public treasury, it would be bad economy to do away with provincial Governors and regard Chief Ministers as a perfect equivalent.
('98', 27, 2, 13, 63174) Whilst I would resent much power of interference to be given to Governors, I do not think that they should be mere figure heads.
('98', 27, 2, 14, 63303) They should have enough power enabling them to influence ministerial policy for the better.
('98', 27, 2, 15, 63395) In their detached position they would be able to see things in their proper perspective and thus prevent mistakes by their Cabinets.
('98', 27, 2, 16, 63528) Theirs must be an all pervasive moral influence in their provinces.
('98', 27, 2, 17, 63596) Principal Agrawal says that there is no mention or direction about village panchayats and decentralization in the foreshadowed Constitution.
('98', 27, 2, 18, 63737) It is certainly an omission calling for immediate attention if our independence is to reflect the people’s voice.
('98', 27, 2, 19, 63851) The greater the power of the panchayats, the better for the people.
('98', 27, 2, 20, 63919) Moreover, panchayats to be effective and efficient, the level of people’s education has to be considerably raised.
('98', 27, 2, 21, 64034) I do not conceive the increase in the power of the people in military, but in moral terms.
('98', 27, 2, 22, 64125) Naturally, I swear by Nayee Talim in this connection.

('98', 28, 2, 3, 64324) MANILAL, I got your letter only today.
('98', 28, 2, 4, 64363) I also got the one sent with Dinshaw.
('98', 28, 2, 5, 64401) I am replying just now to the former.
('98', 28, 2, 6, 64439) It was indeed welcome news to me that Gangabehn 1 had gone there.
('98', 28, 2, 7, 64505) If she is able to stay on there permanently, nothing could be better.
('98', 28, 2, 8, 64575) But that will of course depend on Purushottam’s 2 health.
('98', 28, 2, 9, 64633) I will be glad if a primary teachers’ camp is held there.
('98', 28, 2, 10, 64691) The condition that the camp should involve no financial liability is only reasonable.
('98', 28, 2, 11, 64777) I hope Balkoba’s fund will be completed.
('98', 28, 2, 12, 64818) That Dhiru is persisting in his effort is not surprising, for it is in his nature.
('98', 28, 2, 13, 64901) If the gentleman sent there by Haribhau Phatak can stay there and can be a help to you, that would indeed be fine.
('98', 28, 2, 14, 65016) But his being able to work will depend on his not getting fainting fits.
('98', 28, 2, 15, 65089) In view of the decision not to purchase the Ramanama land, the plan to purchase some other plot seems all right.
('98', 28, 2, 16, 65202) Where will you find the money for it?
('98', 28, 2, 17, 65240) If the work at Uruli progresses steadily, no matter how slowly, I should be very much pleased.
('98', 28, 2, 18, 65335) Your vow of lifelong dedication cannot but produce an echo in the hearts of other people.
('98', 28, 2, 19, 65425) Whatever effect is produced there will be the fruit of ahimsa.
('98', 28, 2, 20, 65488) Without ahimsa village uplift seems impossible to me.

('98', 29, 4, 9, 66272) NEW DELHI, December 11, 1947
('98', 29, 5, 10, 66301) BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
('98', 29, 6, 11, 66323) A friend desires that the verses from the Koran we recite here should be explained.
('98', 29, 6, 12, 66407) These verses are ancient.
('98', 29, 6, 13, 66433) The Koran was composed by Mohammed Saheb—it was spoken by him, thirteen centuries ago.
('98', 29, 6, 14, 66520) The extracts from it that we recite are considered sublime like our mantras.
('98', 29, 6, 15, 66597) The very reading of it bestows merit on the reader.
('98', 29, 6, 16, 66649) It is good to know the meaning, of course, but even without knowing it a correct recitation itself is of great value.
('98', 29, 6, 17, 66767) I can now explain the substance of it.
('98', 29, 6, 18, 66806) I do not know Arabic or Persian.
('98', 29, 6, 19, 66839) I do possess a translation, but it is not here now.
('98', 29, 6, 20, 66891) Tomorrow I can provide a literal translation.
('98', 29, 6, 21, 66937) In substance, it is a prayer to God.
('98', 29, 6, 22, 66974) God is one and the same, by whatever name we may call Him.
('98', 29, 6, 23, 67033) Allah is one of His names.
('98', 29, 6, 24, 67060) Then His attributes are described.
('98', 29, 6, 25, 67095) He is called Rahim and Rehman but He is one God.
('98', 29, 6, 26, 67144) It is then said that God alone can save us from Satan.
('98', 29, 6, 27, 67199) Satan drags us down and makes us do evil deeds only God can save us from that fate.
('98', 29, 6, 28, 67283) Man admits that he on his own does not do noble deeds but God prompts him to do so.
('98', 29, 6, 29, 67367) Man is like a drop of water in a sea.
('98', 29, 6, 30, 67405) If God does not save man Satan will devour him.
('98', 29, 6, 31, 67453) God is great.God is All there is.
('98', 29, 6, 32, 67487) His mercy alone can save us.
('98', 29, 6, 33, 67516) I should say that however much we may recite this prayer, ponder over it and follow its import it is not enough.
('98', 29, 6, 34, 67629) You may ask why in that case Muslims indulge in such barbarous behaviour.
('98', 29, 6, 35, 67703) But then do Christians who have made so much progress, who are learned, follow the teachings of the Bible?
('98', 29, 6, 36, 67810) Where are the Christians that live according to the Bible?
('98', 29, 6, 37, 67869) Where are the Hindus who conduct themselves according to the Gayatri?
('98', 29, 6, 38, 67939) We recite from Ishopanishad, “All things are pervaded by the Lord”, meaning that God is in everything.
('98', 29, 6, 39, 68042) He gives us everything.
('98', 29, 6, 40, 68066) Whatever a man possesses has been given to him by God.
('98', 29, 6, 41, 68121) We should renounce all and enjoy what we must.
('98', 29, 6, 42, 68168) Nothing is ours.
('98', 30, 0, 1, 68185) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 31
('98', 30, 1, 2, 68231) House, property and everything is surrendered to God.
('98', 30, 1, 3, 68285) It is a great thing.
('98', 30, 1, 4, 68306) Then it is said that we should not be envious of others’ riches.
('98', 30, 1, 5, 68371) We should not covet another’s wealth.
('98', 30, 1, 6, 68409) Let the Hindus but conduct themselves according to this one single mantra.
('98', 30, 1, 7, 68484) Let the whole world thus conduct itself.
('98', 30, 1, 8, 68525) It is not for the Hindus alone.
('98', 30, 1, 9, 68557) It does not even mention Hindus.
('98', 30, 1, 10, 68590) Let the Sikhs conduct themselves according to the mantra.
('98', 30, 1, 11, 68648) It is not as if they did not believe in it.
('98', 30, 1, 12, 68692) If everyone conducted himself accordingly the tragedy we have been witnessing all around us could not have come to pass.
('98', 30, 1, 13, 68813) Everyone is not wicked, nor is everyone an angel.
('98', 30, 1, 14, 68863) We cannot say that all Sikhs are wicked while all Hindus are angels or that all Muslims are angels.
('98', 30, 1, 15, 68963) Another verse is from the Parsi scripture.
('98', 30, 1, 16, 69006) The first mantra in the prayer proclaims obeisance to the Guru.
('98', 30, 1, 17, 69070) It is followed by other verses in Sanskrit.
('98', 30, 1, 18, 69114) Then there are bhajans.
('98', 30, 1, 19, 69138) And yet we do not keep our hearts clean.
('98', 30, 1, 20, 69179) It is a painful thing.
('98', 30, 1, 21, 69202) I had said I would explain to you what was being done in the Harijan Colony.
('98', 30, 1, 22, 69279) But I have to leave it for the present, for there are other things to speak of and I have only fifteen minutes.
('98', 30, 1, 23, 69391) Some Muslim friends from the U. P. came to see me today for a second time.
('98', 30, 1, 24, 69466) They told me that they had been to the Punjab in Pakistan.
('98', 30, 1, 25, 69525) They found other Indian Muslims there.
('98', 30, 1, 26, 69564) They had planned to work out with the Muslims there some kind of a compromise which would make things easier here in India.
('98', 30, 1, 27, 69688) They had obtained my permission for the visit.
('98', 30, 1, 28, 69735) They returned today.
('98', 30, 1, 29, 69756) They said they wanted one thing from me.
('98', 30, 1, 30, 69797) I should ask the Hindus and the Sikhs to return to Lahore.
('98', 30, 1, 31, 69856) These Muslim friends will accompany them.
('98', 30, 1, 32, 69898) Should it become necessary they will be the first to lay down their lives.
('98', 30, 1, 33, 69973) But that will not be necessary.
('98', 30, 1, 34, 70005) They have talked to the authorities there.
('98', 30, 1, 35, 70048) They are willing to rehabilitate the non Muslims there.
('98', 30, 1, 36, 70104) I asked them to give it to me in writing.
('98', 30, 1, 37, 70146) It is not something that can be done right away.
('98', 30, 1, 38, 70195) It is a big thing.
('98', 30, 1, 39, 70214) If this can be done a great part of my work will have been accomplished.
('98', 30, 1, 40, 70287) They said, I should at least test their word.
('98', 30, 1, 41, 70333) They have given to me their views in writing.
('98', 30, 1, 42, 70379) Their report says: The Peace Mission from the U. P. visited West Punjab twice.
('98', 30, 1, 43, 70458) The first visit lasted a month and the second a week.
('98', 30, 1, 44, 70512) The conditions there are much improved.
('98', 30, 1, 45, 70552) The Government as well as the public are trying to re establish order.
('98', 30, 1, 46, 70623) It is the desire of the West Punjab Government that the non Muslims residing there at present should continue to live there and those who have
('98', 31, 0, 1, 70766) 32 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 31, 1, 2, 70807) migrated from there should go back to their homes.
('98', 31, 1, 3, 70858) The Government has issued the directive that the non Muslims returning to their homes in West Punjab should be given back their rights over their houses and properties and given full protection and provided with all the facilities they may need.
('98', 31, 1, 4, 71104) If, notwithstanding all the pleading, some non Muslims do not wish to go back, they will have full rights to exchange or sell their properties in any way they like.
('98', 31, 1, 5, 71269) The Government is being very severe with those provoking riots and are taking all measures to ensure protection to those who may return.
('98', 31, 1, 6, 71406) The Peace Mission has been able to persuade the people and the Government of Pakistan to accept the responsibility to protect the honour and dignity of non Muslims.
('98', 31, 1, 7, 71571) We, the members of the U. P. Peace Mission request the non Muslim brethren from Pakistan to go back to West Punjab and settle there.
('98', 31, 1, 8, 71704) We are willing to accompany them on their journey back and will protect them at the cost of our own lives.
('98', 31, 1, 9, 71811) We will return only after these non Muslims are fully assured of their safety.
('98', 31, 1, 10, 71890) This is signed by four persons.
('98', 31, 1, 11, 71922) It is a very promising development.
('98', 31, 1, 12, 71958) The newspapers have put out something quite different but we should not worry about that.
('98', 31, 1, 13, 72048) There are many refugees concen trated in Model Town.
('98', 31, 1, 14, 72101) In Lahore Hindus and Sikhs have large properties.
('98', 31, 1, 15, 72151) There is also a Gurdwara there.
('98', 31, 1, 16, 72183) I asked the Mission from U. P. if the Sikhs could go back there.
('98', 31, 1, 17, 72248) They gave the assurance that Sikhs could go there.
('98', 31, 1, 18, 72299) They said it was not that people in general had become friends; there was still some poison in the air; it could not be removed all at once.
('98', 31, 1, 19, 72440) But the Government had made sure that there would be no more killings.
('98', 31, 1, 20, 72511) It would be a great thing.
('98', 31, 1, 21, 72538) I had not thought things could improve so quickly.
('98', 31, 1, 22, 72589) I do not know how far this is the case, but let us in our hearts grant the possibility that there are people among Muslims who can do this.
('98', 31, 1, 23, 72729) It would be inhuman to think that all Muslims are wicked.
('98', 31, 1, 24, 72787) There are very good men among them.
('98', 31, 1, 25, 72823) A Hindu friend had accompanied the Muslim friends.
('98', 31, 1, 26, 72874) He brought me a letter.
('98', 31, 1, 27, 72898) I have not the time to read it out but its substance is the same.
('98', 31, 1, 28, 72964) He runs a large hotel visited daily by about a thousand persons.
('98', 31, 1, 29, 73029) A majority of them are perhaps Muslims but certainly Hindus also go to the hotel.
('98', 31, 1, 30, 73111) They find no difficulties in their way.
('98', 31, 1, 31, 73151) He says there is nothing to prevent the Hindu refugees from going back there.
('98', 31, 1, 32, 73229) I will not say that
('98', 32, 0, 1, 73249) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 33
('98', 32, 1, 2, 73295) they must go back right away.
('98', 32, 1, 3, 73325) Nor would I say that they should not go.
('98', 32, 1, 4, 73366) But it would be good if they did go back.

('98', 33, 2, 3, 74283) NEW DELHI, December 11/12, 1947
('98', 33, 3, 4, 74315) J. B. KRIPALANI: This meeting has been convened by the Constructive Works Committee of the Congress.
('98', 33, 3, 5, 74416) The question has been raised what the constructive workers should do.
('98', 33, 4, 6, 74486) GANDHIJI: The first thing we have to do is to improve our national character.
('98', 33, 4, 7, 74564) No revolution is possible till we build our character.
('98', 33, 4, 8, 74619) The pity is that though swaraj is so recent an achievement, there is already a slackness in constructive efforts.
('98', 33, 4, 9, 74733) I know there are a few difficulties.
('98', 33, 4, 10, 74770) Government help also may not be forthcoming at places.
('98', 33, 4, 11, 74825) But the Congress has always been in our hands.
('98', 33, 4, 12, 74872) And if you will only make an effort the Government too will remain in our hands.
('98', 33, 5, 13, 74953) QUESTION: Should constructive workers take part in politics?
('98', 33, 6, 14, 75014) GANDHIJI: I have answered this question many times before.
('98', 33, 6, 15, 75073) I repeat my answer: leave politics to Rajendra Babu, Jawaharlal and Vallabhbhai.
('98', 33, 6, 16, 75154) You confine yourselves to constructive work.
('98', 33, 6, 17, 75199) It is difficult to answer the question why constructive work is making so little headway, though the Congress has sworn adherence to it for years and men like Jawaharlal, Rajendra Babu and Vallabhbhai are at the helm of affairs.
('98', 33, 6, 18, 75428) All the Sanghs, except the Harijan Sevak Sangh, were brought into being by the Congress.
('98', 33, 6, 19, 75517) Why is it then that the workers of these Sanghs lack the power to make the Government go the whole hog with them?
('98', 33, 6, 20, 75631) No doubt, the fault lies with us, the constructive workers.
('98', 33, 6, 21, 75691) We had faith in constructive work, but our faith was not deep or enlightened enough to illumine our intellect and so our growth has been lop sided.
('98', 33, 6, 22, 75839) The criticism levelled against the constructive workers is that they are generally lacking in imagination and intellect.
('98', 33, 6, 23, 75960) Our intelligentsia are not lacking in sympathy.
('98', 33, 6, 24, 76008) Reason, as a rule, follows in the footsteps of feeling.
('98', 33, 7, 25, 76064) 1 The versions available in Mahatma and Mahatma Gandhi—The Last Phase have been collated with the Hindi version in Dilhiman Gandhiji.
('98', 33, 7, 26, 76198) Congress workers, including Shankarrao Deo and R. R. Diwakar, had posed the question whether it would not be better in view of the halting policy pursued by the Government, to form themselves into a separate body and go into the Government for the furtherance of the constructive programme.
('98', 34, 0, 1, 76489) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 35
('98', 34, 1, 2, 76535) have not sufficiently penetrated the hearts of the intelligentsia to convince their reason.
('98', 34, 1, 3, 76627) This is my analysis of the situation.
('98', 34, 1, 4, 76665) There should be rapport between the constructive workers and the institution.
('98', 34, 1, 5, 76743) We must first purify ourselves.
('98', 34, 1, 6, 76775) The Congress has always had the constructive programme.
('98', 34, 1, 7, 76831) Now it has the power.
('98', 34, 1, 8, 76853) Why is it then that our work is not progressing?
('98', 34, 1, 9, 76902) It may be that we have no heart.
('98', 34, 1, 10, 76935) Because if we were endowed with a heart we would have been sensitive to the pain of others.
('98', 34, 1, 11, 77027) Moreover, a person may be in sympathy with one in distress and still may not be of any help to him.
('98', 34, 1, 12, 77127) But our minds have not opened.
('98', 34, 1, 13, 77158) Many eminent people who are in politics have had this experience.
('98', 34, 1, 14, 77224) I have had a hand in the formation of all these various institutions, and I can say that things are in such a state because our hearts are not pure.
('98', 34, 1, 15, 77373) A current was generated.
('98', 34, 1, 16, 77398) The people caught on to the idea that that was the way to overcome the British.
('98', 34, 1, 17, 77478) Villagers too flocked to us in ever larger numbers.
('98', 34, 1, 18, 77530) It gladdened us that there was such awakening in the country.
('98', 34, 1, 19, 77592) But in the forefront were intellectuals.
('98', 34, 1, 20, 77633) And the result was that the freedom that came was not true freedom.
('98', 34, 1, 21, 77701) The fight being over, our interest in the constructive programme waned.
('98', 34, 1, 22, 77773) Constructive work is not a strategy or a technique of fighting.
('98', 34, 1, 23, 77837) Constructive work connotes a way of life.
('98', 34, 1, 24, 77879) It can be carried on only by men who have adopted it by the heart as well as by the intellect.
('98', 34, 1, 25, 77974) Kumarappa 1 pointed out that our way of life would be determined by what we do.
('98', 34, 1, 26, 78054) Then the Sangh 2 came to be formed, in which the Congress helped.
('98', 34, 1, 27, 78120) The Congress lent the constructive workers’ Sanghs its name and also gave them the charter to function.
('98', 34, 1, 28, 78224) But the Congressmen failed to come up to the scratch and to shoulder the burden.
('98', 34, 1, 29, 78305) Such is our bankruptcy.
('98', 34, 1, 30, 78329) If the Sanghs could come together and could work under the direction of a jointly chosen representative, it would mark a big step forward.
('98', 34, 1, 31, 78468) To set our own house in order is the first indispensable requisite, if we want to influence political power.
('98', 34, 1, 32, 78577) If all the Sanghs gave a good account of themselves, worked unitedly and in co operation, without a jar or jolt, it would be a grand thing.
('98', 34, 1, 33, 78717) But they must not do it for the sake of popularity, nor hanker after political power, even in their dreams.
('98', 34, 1, 34, 78825) Soon we shall have adult suffrage.
('98', 34, 1, 35, 78860) That is a good thing.
('98', 34, 1, 36, 78882) But to regard adult suffrage as a means of capturing political power, would be to put it to corrupt use.
('98', 34, 2, 37, 78987) 1 J. C. Kumarappa 2 All India Village Industries Association
('98', 35, 0, 1, 79048) 36 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 35, 1, 2, 79089) The objective of the constructive works organizations is to generate political power.
('98', 35, 1, 3, 79175) But if we say that political power having come, it must be ours as a price for our labours, it would degrade us and spell our ruin.
('98', 35, 1, 4, 79307) Take the case of the Charkha Sangh.
('98', 35, 1, 5, 79343) It has the largest membership of all the Sanghs.
('98', 35, 1, 6, 79392) But we have never endeavoured to get its members enrolled on the voters’ list.
('98', 35, 1, 7, 79471) It was suggested at one time that we should get their names enrolled on the Congress register.
('98', 35, 1, 8, 79566) I opposed it.
('98', 35, 1, 9, 79580) “Do we want to capture the Congress?”, I asked.
('98', 35, 1, 10, 79628) That would be tantamount to killing it.
('98', 35, 1, 11, 79668) The Congress can be ours only by right of service.
('98', 35, 1, 12, 79719) Today we have our own Government.
('98', 35, 1, 13, 79753) Under adult suffrage, if we are worth our salt, we should indeed have that hold upon the people that whomsoever we might choose, should be returned.
('98', 35, 1, 14, 79902) In Sevagram I deprecated the proposal of our people enrolling themselves as voters.
('98', 35, 1, 15, 79986) What actually happened was that the people from the village came and sought our advice as to whom they should give their vote, because they knew that we were their true servants and had no axe to grind.
('98', 35, 1, 16, 80189) Today politics has become corrupt.
('98', 35, 1, 17, 80224) Anybody who goes into politics gets contaminated.
('98', 35, 1, 18, 80274) Let us keep out of it altogether.
('98', 35, 1, 19, 80308) Our influence will grow thereby.
('98', 35, 1, 20, 80341) The greater our inner purity, the greater shall be our hold on the people, without any effort on our part.
('98', 35, 1, 21, 80448) My eyes have now been opened.
('98', 35, 1, 22, 80478) I see that what we practised during the fight with the British under the name of non violence, was not really non violence.
('98', 35, 1, 23, 80602) God had purposely sealed my eyes, as He wanted to accomplish His great purpose through me.
('98', 35, 1, 24, 80693) That purpose being accomplished, He has restored to me my sight.
('98', 35, 1, 25, 80758) Now I can see with open eyes what is to be done.
('98', 35, 1, 26, 80807) I have been learning the art for so many years.
('98', 35, 1, 27, 80855) Maybe I have got the technique.
('98', 35, 1, 28, 80887) If I make a mistake I rectify it.
('98', 35, 1, 29, 80921) I therefore say that there is no need for us to consult the Government.
('98', 35, 1, 30, 80993) They went as far as they could.
('98', 35, 1, 31, 81025) Has what I am doing today penetrated your hearts?
('98', 35, 1, 32, 81075) Then you should have the strength to remove corruption, wheresoever it may be.
('98', 35, 1, 33, 81154) You have met here as the constructive wing of the Congress.
('98', 35, 1, 34, 81214) For that you need not get into any committee.
('98', 35, 1, 35, 81260) Your work is among the masses.
('98', 35, 1, 36, 81291) The Constituent Assembly is today forging the Constitution.
('98', 35, 1, 37, 81351) Do not bother about making changes in it.
('98', 35, 1, 38, 81393) Shriman Narayan Agrawal has written to me that in the Constitution that is being framed now, there is no mention of gram panchayat, whereas the Congressmen have always said that the gram panchayat must be the foundation of our future
('98', 36, 0, 1, 81627) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 37
('98', 36, 1, 2, 81673) polity.
('98', 36, 1, 3, 81681) We have to resuscitate the village, make it prosperous and give it more education and more power.
('98', 36, 1, 4, 81779) What good will the Constitution be if the village does not find its due place in it?
('98', 36, 1, 5, 81864) What Shriman Narayan Agrawal says, appeals to me.
('98', 36, 1, 6, 81914) But we must recognize the fact that the social order of our dreams cannot come through the Congress of today.
('98', 36, 1, 7, 82024) Nobody knows what shape the Constitution will ultimately take.
('98', 36, 1, 8, 82087) I say, leave it to those who are labouring at it.
('98', 36, 1, 9, 82137) Let the constructive workers consolidate their strength, and the way to do it is through the unification of the various constructive works organizations.
('98', 36, 1, 10, 82291) And if we cannot do that, let each Sangh continue on its way and develop its strength as best as it can, making intelligence more and more the hallmark of all its activity.
('98', 36, 1, 11, 82464) The Charkha Sangh is the biggest Sangh.
('98', 36, 1, 12, 82504) It has funds.
('98', 36, 1, 13, 82518) It is pursuing the policy of decentralization.
('98', 36, 1, 14, 82565) I am not unaware of its perils and its difficulties.
('98', 36, 1, 15, 82618) We have to create a superior, more advanced type of khadi worker.
('98', 36, 1, 16, 82684) Not till then, shall Panchayat Raj become a reality.
('98', 36, 1, 17, 82737) The workers of the Charkha Sangh are not there merely to earn a living for themselves or merely to distribute some wages to the spinners and weavers, etc., by way of poor relief.
('98', 36, 1, 18, 82916) The only goal worthy of their ambition is to create a non violent order of society.
('98', 36, 1, 19, 83000) But, in this they have not made much headway.
('98', 36, 1, 20, 83046) If our khadi workers are there for wages only, then we had better bid good bye to the dream of realizing a non violent social order.
('98', 36, 1, 21, 83179) The success will depend on our uttermost purity.
('98', 36, 1, 22, 83228) Impatience would be fatal.
('98', 36, 1, 23, 83255) We are today rather poor.
('98', 36, 1, 24, 83281) But this poverty does not discourage me.
('98', 36, 1, 25, 83322) Only now we are coming to realize that all our workers are from cities.
('98', 36, 1, 26, 83394) They do not even know what non violence is.
('98', 36, 1, 27, 83438) When a woman gives me yarn she does it for money.
('98', 36, 1, 28, 83488) But why does she covet money?
('98', 36, 1, 29, 83518) The root cause is poverty.
('98', 36, 1, 30, 83545) It is that root we have to destroy.
('98', 36, 1, 31, 83581) Where is khadi today?
('98', 36, 1, 32, 83603) The people who wear khadi do so to gain political ends.
('98', 36, 1, 33, 83659) There is no credit in it.
('98', 36, 1, 34, 83685) Our work may be slow but we can generate great strength through it.
('98', 36, 1, 35, 83753) Let us forget about the Congress Constitution, because even after the Constitution has been given shape our work must go on.
('98', 36, 1, 36, 83878) We have to pursue our ends in a different way.
('98', 36, 1, 37, 83925) You must not succumb to the desire to become ministers.
('98', 36, 1, 38, 83981) The really poor villager is haunted by the spectre of destitution.
('98', 36, 1, 39, 84048) He cannot see beyond the satisfaction of his primary needs.
('98', 36, 1, 40, 84108) The villager does not understand non violence, nor do I talk to him of it, but I try only to see that he becomes a good spinner and gets a fair minimum subsistence wage.
('98', 36, 1, 41, 84278) I do not mind if the volume of our work
('98', 37, 0, 1, 84318) 38 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 37, 1, 2, 84359) is small, so long as it is solid.
('98', 37, 1, 3, 84393) Constitution making will be over in a few months.
('98', 37, 1, 4, 84443) What next?
('98', 37, 1, 5, 84454) The responsibility of working it and making a success of it will rest on you.
('98', 37, 1, 6, 84532) Suppose you get a constitution after your heart, but it does not work.
('98', 37, 1, 7, 84603) After five years, someone will say: ‘You had your innings, now give us a chance.’ You will have to give in and they may try to seize power, set up a dictatorship and strangulate the Congress.
('98', 37, 1, 8, 84795) Per contra, suppose you do not assume power but gain hold on the public, you will be able to return at the polls whomsoever you may wish.
('98', 37, 1, 9, 84933) Forget membership so long as the voters are in your hand.
('98', 37, 1, 10, 84991) Think of the root and take care of it as much as you can, and make self purification the sole criterion.
('98', 37, 1, 11, 85096) Even a handful imbued with this spirit will be able to transform the atmosphere.
('98', 37, 1, 12, 85177) The people will soon perceive the change and they will not be slow to respond to it.
('98', 37, 1, 13, 85262) Yours is an uphill and difficult task but it is full of rich promise.
('98', 37, 2, 14, 85332) QUESTION: The people are with us, but the Government obstruct our effort.
('98', 37, 2, 15, 85406) What are we to do?
('98', 37, 3, 16, 85425) GANDHIJI: If the people are with you, the Government are bound to respond.
('98', 37, 3, 17, 85500) If they do not, they will be set aside and another installed in their place.
('98', 37, 3, 18, 85577) Even in the days of Lord Wavell, I used to tell the people that they did not know their own strength, or they could get Lord Wavell removed at will.
('98', 37, 3, 19, 85726) When the British saw that he would rule over us only by martial law, they removed him.
('98', 37, 3, 20, 85813) It is a tribute to the British, for they could very well have imposed martial law.
('98', 37, 4, 21, 85896) QUESTION: Should there not be an over all organization, which would include and co ordinate all the Sanghs’ activities?
('98', 37, 4, 22, 86016) GANDHIJI: A separate organization is not necessary for that purpose.
('98', 37, 4, 23, 86085) What is needed is co ordination of the work of the Sanghs.
('98', 37, 4, 24, 86144) The various Sanghs have worked separately and independently of one another till now.
('98', 37, 4, 25, 86229) We tried to set up a co ordinating committee for the purpose of samagra gram seva, but it did not work.
('98', 37, 4, 26, 86333) If we all unite, we shall function like the departments of the Central Government.
('98', 37, 4, 27, 86416) For instance, why should there be separate stores and sales depots for the Spinners’ Association and the Village Industries Association?
('98', 37, 4, 28, 86553) Why could not the machinery of the Spinners’ Association be available for furthering the activities of both?
('98', 37, 4, 29, 86662) The members of the Charkha Sangh will do the work of the Gram Udyog too.
('98', 37, 4, 30, 86735) There is the question of the sale of tad gur.
('98', 37, 4, 31, 86781) Why should not the Charkha Sangh take it over?
('98', 37, 4, 32, 86828) Our workers’ children have to be educated.
('98', 37, 4, 33, 86871) Shall we build a separate school for them?
('98', 37, 4, 34, 86914) Is that not the function of the Talimi Sangh?
('98', 38, 0, 1, 86960) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 39
('98', 38, 1, 2, 87006) will not co operate even in such matters, it will show that we have not understood how ahimsa works.
('98', 38, 1, 3, 87107) The central body will lay down the general lines of policy which all the Sanghs will follow.
('98', 38, 1, 4, 87200) If we are determined and pledge ourselves to ‘do or die’, we are bound to succeed.
('98', 38, 2, 5, 87283) ARYANAYAKUM: Let the Presidents and Secretaries of the various Sanghs meet
('98', 38, 3, 6, 87358) first in a preliminary informal conference and, after discussion, place before Gandhiji
('98', 38, 4, 7, 87446) the implication and difficulties of unification.
('98', 38, 5, 8, 87495) SHANKARRAO DEO: This is not the right way to go about it.
('98', 38, 5, 9, 87553) The workers should
('98', 38, 6, 10, 87572) meet first.
('98', 38, 6, 11, 87584) A gathering of the Presidents and the Secretaries will not have the requisite
('98', 38, 7, 12, 87662) atmosphere.
('98', 38, 7, 13, 87674) It is a narrow and subjective approach.
('98', 38, 8, 14, 87714) GANDHIJI: It is neither narrow, nor subjective.
('98', 38, 8, 15, 87762) The workers’ conference can follow, not precede.
('98', 38, 8, 16, 87811) The Charkha Sangh has its Board; Jajuji 1 must consult it first.
('98', 38, 8, 17, 87876) The average worker will not even understand.
('98', 38, 9, 18, 87921) SHANKARRAO DEO: We have a number of intelligent workers, let them
('98', 38, 10, 19, 87987) be called.
('98', 38, 11, 20, 87998) GANDHIJI: We seem to be talking at cross purposes.
('98', 38, 11, 21, 88049) The discussion that I have proposed, involves technical matters.
('98', 38, 11, 22, 88114) It needs specialists.
('98', 38, 11, 23, 88136) The general workers will feel themselves at sea in such a discussion.
('98', 38, 11, 24, 88206) Let the props and pillars unite.
('98', 38, 11, 25, 88239) All will then feel the glow of strength.
('98', 38, 11, 26, 88280) Forget me.
('98', 38, 11, 27, 88291) Dr. Zakir Husain is a great organizer.
('98', 38, 11, 28, 88330) He has suggested that just now nothing should be decided under the spell of my presence.
('98', 38, 11, 29, 88419) And, therefore, he has recommended that the matter be taken up later at Sevagram.
('98', 38, 11, 30, 88501) I like it.
('98', 38, 11, 31, 88512) The atmosphere at Sevagram would be calmer and free from the communal virus.
('98', 38, 11, 32, 88589) When I came here, I did know that I would have to speak on these things.
('98', 38, 11, 33, 88662) I was told that in the Constitution Committee of the Congress there were some constructive workers; how could they make their influence felt in the Congress?
('98', 38, 11, 34, 88820) I had come to tell you that you must not expect to get the Constitution you desire through the Congress.
('98', 38, 11, 35, 88925) Nor need that worry you.
('98', 38, 11, 36, 88950) It should be enough if the Constitution you get does not actually stand in the way of constructive effort.
('98', 38, 11, 37, 89057) The second thing I had come to tell you was that the various Sanghs should become the research laboratories in their respective fields.
('98', 38, 11, 38, 89193) Our constructive works

('98', 39, 0, 1, 89238) 40 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 39, 1, 2, 89279) institutions are not democracies, but they are the instruments for the building up of democracy.
('98', 39, 1, 3, 89376) The Congress has lent us its name and its prestige and, in return, it derives prestige from us for the service which, as its true servants, we render.
('98', 39, 1, 4, 89527) The connection of the constructive works organizations with the Congress is spiritual.
('98', 39, 1, 5, 89614) It can be severed at any moment.
('98', 39, 1, 6, 89647) As specialists we should be able to tender to the Congress our advice on what needs to be done.
('98', 39, 2, 7, 89743) QUESTION: Why cannot we get it done through the Congress?
('98', 39, 3, 8, 89801) GANDHIJI: Because the Congressmen are not sufficiently interested in constructive work.
('98', 39, 3, 9, 89889) If they were, it should not have been necessary for us to meet here.
('98', 39, 4, 10, 89958) QUESTION: That being the Congressmen’s psychology, what is the use of
('98', 39, 5, 11, 90028) giving place to the constructive works organizations in the Congress Constitution?
('98', 39, 6, 12, 90111) GANDHIJI: Because the Constitution moulds the psychology of the people.
('98', 39, 6, 13, 90183) People may not do the things they believe, but then it should be our duty to see that through our neglect our case does not go by default.
('98', 39, 7, 14, 90322) QUESTION: Labour is represented in the Assembly through their
('98', 39, 8, 15, 90384) representatives.
('98', 39, 8, 16, 90401) There are special seats reserved for universities.
('98', 39, 8, 17, 90452) Why should
('98', 39, 9, 18, 90463) not constructive workers’ organizations have their functional representatives in the
('98', 39, 10, 19, 90548) A. I. C. C., who would act in the general way, too?
('98', 39, 11, 20, 90600) GANDHIJI: No, surely not the mixture.
('98', 39, 11, 21, 90638) Functional is all right.
('98', 39, 11, 22, 90663) But in general there is so much corruption today, that it frightens me.
('98', 39, 11, 23, 90735) Everybody wants to carry a lot of votes in his pockets, because the votes give power.
('98', 39, 11, 24, 90821) Under adult suffrage, anybody who is eligible has a vote.
('98', 39, 11, 25, 90879) Let all such members of the various Sanghs form themselves into one body and let the Congress Working Committee and the A. I. C. C. take from among them their nominees, to advise and to guide them in matters and policies pertaining to constructive work.
('98', 39, 11, 26, 91133) There are many labour organisations in the country.
('98', 39, 11, 27, 91185) There is the Ahmedabad Labour Union, the Charkha Sangh, the Goseva Sangh, the Chamber of Commerce and so on.
('98', 39, 11, 28, 91294) The Congress claims to represent them all.
('98', 39, 11, 29, 91337) The Congress, of course, claims to represent the Princes too.
('98', 39, 11, 30, 91399) But I would not ask you to include the Chamber of Princes in your scheme.
('98', 39, 11, 31, 91473) Take all the living organizations with you.

('98', 40, 4, 9, 91879) December 11/12, 1947 2
('98', 40, 5, 10, 91902) There were some workers, who were worried at the paradox free India Government presented.
('98', 40, 5, 11, 91992) The Congress had sworn adherence to the constructive programme for years, while it was in the wilderness.
('98', 40, 5, 12, 92098) But having come into power, it showed signs of giving it the go by.
('98', 40, 5, 13, 92166) Was not the remedy for those who had faith in the constructive work to enter the Government and use it for the purpose of building up a non violent social order?
('98', 40, 5, 14, 92328) Gandhiji was opposed to it, but he held that the purpose could be achieved if the various organizations which he had founded for carrying on constructive work came up to the standard which he had set for them.
('98', 40, 5, 15, 92538) And as a preparatory step to the discharge of that role, he recommended the unification and co ordination of those organizations into one body.
('98', 40, 5, 16, 92682) He placed the onus of the transformation on the shoulders of the Hindustani Talimi Sangh.
('98', 40, 5, 17, 92772) It should be easy for them to do that if Nayee Talim was what he had envisaged it to be.
('98', 40, 5, 18, 92861) What he had proposed was only a part of adult education.
('98', 40, 5, 19, 92918) The Nayee Talim is today on its trial.
('98', 40, 5, 20, 92957) It has either to transform the prevailing atmosphere, or perish in the attempt.
('98', 40, 5, 21, 93037) There is one section in the country today in our midst which holds that the Hindus and Muslims cannot coexist, that either the Muslims should get out of Hindustan or they should live here as the vassals of the Hindus.
('98', 40, 5, 22, 93255) And similarly, in Pakistan, only the Muslims should remain.
('98', 40, 5, 23, 93315) It is a poisonous doctrine and in it lies the root of Pakistan.
('98', 40, 5, 24, 93379) Pakistan has come into being; their dream has vanished but the virus has remained.
('98', 40, 5, 25, 93462) I have pledged myself to resist this doctrine and to do or die in the attempt.
('98', 40, 5, 26, 93541) But to correct the wrong psychology of the people is the function of Nayee Talim.
('98', 40, 6, 27, 93623) Dr. Zakir Husain said that while in principle what Gandhiji had stated was unexceptionable, still there was need to hasten slowly.
('98', 40, 6, 28, 93754) Things had changed considerably after independence.
('98', 40, 6, 29, 93806) Everybody felt the urge and impatience to make new
('98', 40, 7, 30, 93857) 1 The two day session was presided over by Zakir Husain.
('98', 40, 7, 31, 93914) 2 From The Hindustan Times, 13 12 1947
('98', 41, 0, 1, 93953) 42 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 41, 1, 2, 93994) and daring experiments and the need for an absolutely free hand.
('98', 41, 1, 3, 94059) If the merger resulted in maladjustment, it might retard, instead of helping progress.
('98', 41, 2, 4, 94146) A suggestion was then made that they might function as the separate branches of a tree that have sprung from a common trunk and a reference was made in that connection to the Gandhi Seva Sangh which was described as functioning as the parent trunk, at one time.
('98', 41, 2, 5, 94408) But Gandhiji smelt danger in that.
('98', 41, 2, 6, 94443) He did not want the constructive workers’ organizations to be drawn into power politics and become a rival to the Congress or the Government in the contest for political power.
('98', 41, 2, 7, 94620) Gandhi Seva Sangh is no longer there.
('98', 41, 2, 8, 94658) Nor did it attempt to rally all constructive workers under one organization.
('98', 41, 2, 9, 94735) It did once make a short lived attempt to enter into and purify the politics of the country but had to admit defeat.
('98', 41, 3, 10, 94852) ZAKIR HUSAIN: Various organizations were created separately as ad hoc bodies to perform certain specific functions.
('98', 41, 3, 11, 94968) If they are united into one body, it will not be possible to keep power politics out of it.
('98', 41, 3, 12, 95060) If the united constructive workers’ sangh tried to go into power politics, it would spell its ruin.
('98', 41, 3, 13, 95160) Or else why should I myself not have gone into politics and tried to run the Government my way?
('98', 41, 3, 14, 95256) Those who are holding the reins of power today, would easily have stepped aside and made room for me, but whilst they are in charge, they can carry on only according to their own lights.
('98', 41, 3, 15, 95443) But I do not want to take power into my hands.
('98', 41, 3, 16, 95490) By abjuring power and by devoting ourselves to pure and selfless service of the voters, we can guide and influence them.
('98', 41, 3, 17, 95611) It would give us far more real power than we shall have by going into the Government.
('98', 41, 3, 18, 95697) But a stage may come, when the people themselves may feel and say that they want us and no one else to wield the power.
('98', 41, 3, 19, 95817) The question could then be considered.
('98', 41, 3, 20, 95856) I shall most probably be not alive then.
('98', 41, 3, 21, 95897) But when that time comes, the Sanghs will produce from amongst them someone who will take over the reins of administration.
('98', 41, 3, 22, 96021) By that time, India shall have become an ideal state.
('98', 41, 4, 23, 96075) ZAKIR HUSAIN: Shall not we need ideal men in order to inaugurate and run the ideal State?
('98', 41, 4, 24, 96165) We can send men of our choice, without going into the Government ourselves.
('98', 41, 4, 25, 96241) Today, everybody in the Congress is running after power.
('98', 41, 4, 26, 96298) That presages grave danger.
('98', 41, 4, 27, 96326) Let us not be in the same cry as the power seekers.
('98', 41, 4, 28, 96378) Today, many Congressmen say: “Pandit Jawaharlal is getting so much salary, and why should not we?” They forget that a person of Jawaharlal’s talents could any day have commanded a far greater emolument than he is getting today.

('98', 42, 1, 3, 96836) It is my firm view, that we should keep altogether aloof from power politics and its contagion.

('98', 42, 10, 18, 97478) BROTHER KANJI, I have received your letter.
('98', 42, 10, 19, 97522) Only that you may not feel any anxiety, I am writing this reply.
('98', 42, 10, 20, 97587) Other controls may go and there may be harm because of their going.
('98', 42, 10, 21, 97655) Let there be harm.
('98', 42, 10, 22, 97674) But why don’t you give up the control on your English?
('98', 42, 10, 23, 97729) Your mother tongue is Gujarati, how is it that you have forgotten it completely?
('98', 42, 11, 24, 97810) 1 It was decided to hold an All India Basic Education Conference from March 6 to 9 in Bihar.

('98', 43, 1, 2, 98091) How can I leave the Birla Brothers’ house if somebody else tells me to do so?
('98', 43, 1, 3, 98169) When my experience is to the contrary, to say that they are opposed to [de]control is not correct.
('98', 43, 1, 4, 98268) Reasons for removal of control for me and them are different and my opposition to control is of long standing and from the time when I was not living in their house.
('98', 43, 1, 5, 98434) Everybody must act on the promptings of his conscience; you, on yours; I, on mine; others, on their own; and from that at last truth will come out.

('98', 43, 5, 10, 98707) NEW DELHI, December 12, 1947
('98', 43, 6, 11, 98736) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, I have a letter from a refugee, saying I had advised the refugees yesterday to start going back.
('98', 43, 6, 12, 98855) I had said nothing of the kind.
('98', 43, 6, 13, 98887) I had said that we would have to see about it and could say something definite only after I had made sure that what I had been told represented the truth.
('98', 43, 6, 14, 99042) The correspondent says that he wants to go back right away because here there is anarchy all round, no one cares about anyone else, there is no food to eat and no clothes to wear, and nothing is being done for the refugees.
('98', 43, 6, 15, 99266) I am aware that all this is true.
('98', 43, 6, 16, 99300) Things have reached a stage where everyone cannot be looked after and everything cannot be made available.
('98', 43, 6, 17, 99407) I think that all that is possible is being done.
('98', 43, 6, 18, 99456) But even if it is not being done I cannot advise anyone to go back.
('98', 43, 6, 19, 99524) If they had not come at all it would have been different.
('98', 43, 6, 20, 99582) But since they have come they should return only after things are fully normal.
('98', 43, 6, 21, 99662) They should certainly be in readiness, for the sooner they are in a position to go back the better it will be.
('98', 43, 6, 22, 99773) Yesterday I had said I would read out to you the translation of the verse from the Koran recited here.
('98', 43, 6, 23, 99876) I had already explained to you the substance.
('98', 43, 6, 24, 99922) The translation runs: “I surrender myself to Allah to save myself from the wicked Satan.
('98', 43, 6, 25, 100011) I begin with the name of God.
('98', 43, 6, 26, 100041) Whatever I do, I do in His name because it is He who provides
('98', 44, 0, 1, 100103) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 45
('98', 44, 1, 2, 100149) everything, He who is Rahim, the mighty, and Rehman, the merciful.
('98', 44, 1, 3, 100216) He is all in all.
('98', 44, 1, 4, 100234) God is one.
('98', 44, 1, 5, 100246) He is unborn.
('98', 44, 1, 6, 100260) It is He who causes everything to be born.
('98', 44, 1, 7, 100303) He has no equal.
('98', 44, 1, 8, 100320) He is sufficient unto Himself.
('98', 44, 1, 9, 100351) That is why we say that He is faultless and formless.
('98', 44, 1, 10, 100405) He is the home of all attributes.
('98', 44, 1, 11, 100439) His attributes cannot be fathomed.” Today I have four or five letters.
('98', 44, 1, 12, 100510) One is from Kathiawar.
('98', 44, 1, 13, 100533) I had mentioned a letter from some Muslims from Kathiawar 1 but a few Muslims object even to that.
('98', 44, 1, 14, 100632) I do not know why.
('98', 44, 1, 15, 100651) The same people who had made accusations had written to me that nothing much had happened and if there had been some slight disturbance the Congressmen had tried their best to establish peace and that they were living happily in their homes.
('98', 44, 1, 16, 100893) Another letter is from Burma and yet another from perhaps Bombay.
('98', 44, 1, 17, 100959) It is unsigned and I do not know where to send my reply.
('98', 44, 1, 18, 101016) The letter from Bombay says that I do nothing but create confusion.
('98', 44, 1, 19, 101084) Whether or not I am creating confusion, I know, and you who hear me also know.
('98', 44, 1, 20, 101163) It says I should investigate what happened in Kathiawar, but how can, I unless I am supplied with details?
('98', 44, 1, 21, 101270) It is not within my power to initiate any investigation.
('98', 44, 1, 22, 101327) I can only ask the Government to do so.
('98', 44, 1, 23, 101367) Another letter is about Ajmer.
('98', 44, 1, 24, 101398) It is from the Hindus.
('98', 44, 1, 25, 101421) They say what I had said was not the truth.
('98', 44, 1, 26, 101465) 2 There had been rioting no doubt but it was not started by the Hindus.
('98', 44, 1, 27, 101537) It was started by the Muslims.
('98', 44, 1, 28, 101568) It had always been like that.
('98', 44, 1, 29, 101598) Then I realized that this is the other side of the picture.
('98', 44, 1, 30, 101658) God alone knows what is true and what is not.
('98', 44, 1, 31, 101704) I had based my statement on what I had seen in the newspapers.
('98', 44, 1, 32, 101767) I had also heard things from various people.
('98', 44, 1, 33, 101812) If we persist in such conduct we cannot keep the Government going.
('98', 44, 1, 34, 101879) A correspondent wants money to be made available for the renovation of the Somnath temple.
('98', 44, 1, 35, 101970) The Sardar had agreed that the temple should be renovated but that the money should not be taken from the Junagadh treasury or the treasury of the Government of India.
('98', 44, 1, 36, 102138) The correspondent asks why the money should not thus be made available.
('98', 44, 1, 37, 102210) I do not wish to go into the question in any detail.
('98', 44, 1, 38, 102263) All I can say is that if money is taken from the Government for this purpose, then the same rule should apply to other cases also.
('98', 44, 1, 39, 102394) It will

('98', 45, 0, 1, 102495) 46 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 45, 1, 2, 102536) have far reaching consequences.
('98', 45, 1, 3, 102568) According to newspaper reports there has been rowdyism in Calcutta.
('98', 45, 1, 4, 102636) 1 It seems that we have got used to thinking that we can take what we want by resorting to rowdyism.
('98', 45, 1, 5, 102737) It is a dangerous trend.
('98', 45, 1, 6, 102762) This is a thing I have never taught.
('98', 45, 1, 7, 102799) We fought against the British for thirty years.
('98', 45, 1, 8, 102847) But it was a non violent struggle.
('98', 45, 1, 9, 102882) There was no place in it for physical assaults or snatching things by force.
('98', 45, 1, 10, 102959) The Government in Bengal is our government.
('98', 45, 1, 11, 103003) It is run by Congressmen.
('98', 45, 1, 12, 103029) They should not have been subjected to such behaviour.
('98', 45, 1, 13, 103084) Supposing they have made a mistake—I personally do not know where their mistake lay— rowdyism is not the way to point it out.
('98', 45, 1, 14, 103210) Why should we indulge in barbaric behaviour?
('98', 45, 1, 15, 103255) There were students among those who indulged in rowdyism.
('98', 45, 1, 16, 103313) They are well educated.
('98', 45, 1, 17, 103337) It hardly behoves them to stop the members of the Assembly from entering the Assembly, to block all the entrances and, not stopping there, to get into the Assembly itself.
('98', 45, 1, 18, 103509) But that is what they did.
('98', 45, 1, 19, 103536) It seems to me that if we persist in this kind of thing the Government cannot be carried on for long.
('98', 45, 1, 20, 103638) The demonstration was intended to make the Assembly desist from enacting the Bill that the demonstrators did not want.
('98', 45, 1, 21, 103757) The Bill proposed by the Government is meant for preventing people from indulging in violent activities.
('98', 45, 1, 22, 103862) Even if the demonstrators did not like this Bill, they should have expressed their opposition in a peaceful way.
('98', 45, 1, 23, 103975) They should not have indulged in rowdyism.
('98', 45, 1, 24, 104018) We did not do such things against the British, If any people did so I used to admonish them.
('98', 45, 1, 25, 104111) We always behaved as gentlemen—I for one even used to undertake fasts.
('98', 45, 1, 26, 104182) Our Government today is faced with a number of important tasks.
('98', 45, 1, 27, 104246) Those tasks have to be attended to.
('98', 45, 1, 28, 104282) We cannot complain if it becomes necessary for the police to resort to lathi charge or use of tear gas or to firing.
('98', 45, 1, 29, 104399) Freedom does not mean that those provoking breach of peace should not be punished.
('98', 45, 1, 30, 104482) If this happens one should not complain.
('98', 45, 1, 31, 104523) There are various lawful ways of voicing protests.
('98', 45, 1, 32, 104574) You can talk to people, write in the newspapers, complain to the Parliament or to the Central Government.
('98', 45, 1, 33, 104680) We have all the necessary means.
('98', 45, 1, 34, 104713) We cannot say the Government is ineffective.
('98', 45, 1, 35, 104758) It is only three months old.
('98', 45, 1, 36, 104787) We are like a three month old child.
('98', 45, 1, 37, 104824) one cannot say we are mature.
('98', 45, 2, 38, 104854) 1 On December 11, there was a demonstration in Calcutta against the Security Bill, which was pending in the Assembly.
('98', 45, 2, 39, 104972) One person was killed and several people were injured in the clash between the demonstrators and the police.

('98', 46, 1, 2, 105127) would therefore humbly plead with those who resort to rowdyism to desist from it.
('98', 46, 1, 3, 105209) It is not that all of those indulging in rowdyism are hooligans or illiterate people.
('98', 46, 1, 4, 105295) There are among them well educated people.
('98', 46, 1, 5, 105338) If they carry on such activities all the work we want to do will come to a stop.
('98', 46, 1, 6, 105419) We have to reach food to the people.
('98', 46, 1, 7, 105456) We have to provide them assistance in various other ways.
('98', 46, 1, 8, 105514) It seems that it has become a profession with some to have all work stopped.
('98', 46, 1, 9, 105591) This should not be so.
('98', 46, 1, 10, 105614) It is a mercy that the entire population of Calcutta was not involved in this.
('98', 46, 1, 11, 105693) But even if they were, it would not have been a good thing.
('98', 46, 1, 12, 105753) This kind of thing should stop.
('98', 46, 1, 13, 105785) People should realize that the Government belongs to them and if the Government does not help them they should protest in lawful ways.

('98', 46, 5, 19, 106091) Irrelevance is always untruth and should never be uttered.
('98', 46, 5, 20, 106150) Misdeeds of the Hindus in the Union have to be proclaimed by the Hindus from the house tops, if those of the Muslims in Pakistan are to be arrested or stopped.
('98', 46, 5, 21, 106310) Confession of one’s guilt purifies and uplifts.
('98', 46, 5, 22, 106358) Its suppression is degrading and should always be avoided.

('98', 46, 6, 24, 106466) 33. THE DOCTRINE OF MERGER 2
('98', 46, 7, 25, 106495) Merger, as used here, has no legal significance.
('98', 46, 7, 26, 106544) People of some States in the Deccan Union 3 are reported to have expressed an intense desire for extinction of their Princely houses and their absorption in their provinces.
('98', 46, 7, 27, 106718) This has been described as merging in British India (as it was called during British rule), as distinguished from Princely
('98', 46, 8, 28, 106841) 1 A Gujarati version of this appeared in Harijanbandhu, 21 12 1947. 2 A Hindi version of this appeared in Harijan Sevak, 21 12 1947. 3 The Deccan States’ Union consisted of the States of Aundh, Bhor, Miraj Junior, Sangli, Ramdurg, Phaltan, Kurundwar Senior and Kurundwar Junior.
('98', 47, 0, 1, 107120) 48 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 47, 1, 2, 107161) India or States.
('98', 47, 1, 3, 107178) In a society based on non violence, there should be no impatient destruction compassed by [one] man of another, for, every evil doer, unless he mends his ways, is bound to destroy himself.
('98', 47, 1, 4, 107367) Evil can never be self existent.
('98', 47, 1, 5, 107400) Therefore, the Congress policy has always been to mend Princely rule, not to end it, and to induce the Princes to become trustees and servants in reality of their people.
('98', 47, 1, 6, 107571) In pursuance of that policy the Congress Government has tried and in the main succeeded in inducing the States to accede to the Union instead of planning the destruction of Princely rule and absorption of their States as an integral part of the Union provinces concerned.
('98', 47, 1, 7, 107843) Therefore, merger can take place only under two conditions, viz., if the misrule of a particular Prince is self evident and is irremediable, the people will have the right, as it will be their duty, to seek absorption or merger in their province.
('98', 47, 1, 8, 108090) The second condition would be when a Prince and the people of his State both desire merger.
('98', 47, 1, 9, 108182) It is suggested that any one State or its people, whether powerful or insignificant, should not seek merger unless all the States or the majority desire it.
('98', 47, 1, 10, 108339) I do not think so.
('98', 47, 1, 11, 108358) Misrule cannot wait to be ended before there is equal misrule in other States.
('98', 47, 1, 12, 108437) Nor can a Prince who does not wish for any Princely power be expected or be made to wait till the other Princes are ready.
('98', 47, 1, 13, 108560) Each case will have to be decided on its merits by the Central Government.

('98', 47, 4, 17, 108702) A correspondent writes:
('98', 47, 5, 18, 108726) I and the members of my family have been regular spinners and weavers of khadi.
('98', 47, 5, 19, 108806) Now that we have got our freedom, do you still contend that we should spin and wear khadi?
('98', 47, 5, 20, 108897) This is a strange question.
('98', 47, 5, 21, 108925) Nevertheless, it represents the condition of many people.
('98', 47, 5, 22, 108983) Such persons evidently took to the spinning wheel and khadi merely mechanically and as one of the means of attaining freedom.
('98', 47, 5, 23, 109109) These friends forget that freedom was not mere removal of the foreign yoke, though it was the first essential.
('98', 47, 5, 24, 109220) Khadi represents and represented a way of life based on non violence.
('98', 47, 6, 25, 109290) 1 A Gujarati version of this appeared in Harijanbandhu, 21 12 1947.
('98', 48, 0, 1, 109358) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 49
('98', 48, 1, 2, 109404) Rightly or wrongly, it is my opinion that practical disappearance of khadi and non violence shows that the main implication of khadi was not grasped by us during all these years.
('98', 48, 1, 3, 109583) Hence, the tragedy we witness of fratricidal strife and the lawlessness on many sides.
('98', 48, 1, 4, 109670) I have no doubt that spinning and weaving of khadi are more important than ever if we are to have freedom that is to be instinctively felt by the masses of the villagers of India.
('98', 48, 1, 5, 109850) That is the Kingdom of God on earth.
('98', 48, 1, 6, 109887) Through khadi we were struggling to establish supremacy of man in the place of the supremacy of power driven machine over him.
('98', 48, 1, 7, 110014) Through khadi we were striving for equality of all men and women in the place of the gross inequality to be witnessed today.
('98', 48, 1, 8, 110139) We were striving to attain subservience of capital under labour in the place of the insolent triumph of capital over labour.
('98', 48, 1, 9, 110264) Unless, therefore, all the effort made during the past thirty years in India was a retrograde step, hand spinning and all it implies must be prosecuted with much greater vigour and far greater intelligence than hitherto.

('98', 49, 3, 5, 111186) As Dada also will be arriving there by tomorrow, I must write a few lines.
('98', 49, 3, 6, 111261) I don’t like your having the stroke.
('98', 49, 3, 7, 111298) If the cause is not internal, you will soon get well.
('98', 49, 3, 8, 111352) But the rule is that after such an attack the patient must take complete rest for some time.
('98', 49, 3, 9, 111445) Probably the sea coast will be more suitable.

('98', 49, 7, 19, 111839) NEW DELHI, December 13, 1947
('98', 49, 8, 20, 111868) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, Yesterday I told you that I was going to Harijan Nivas for doing some work there.
('98', 49, 8, 21, 111972) The meetings of the Charkha Sangh and Talimi Sangh, etc., were being held there in which I had something to do.
('98', 49, 8, 22, 112084) I shall speak to you about that.
('98', 49, 8, 23, 112117) Today I would speak to you about the charkha which was the subject of discussion there.
('98', 49, 8, 24, 112205) What is the significance of the charkha?
('98', 49, 8, 25, 112246) Why do I lay so much emphasis on it?
('98', 49, 8, 26, 112283) It is true that when I first discovered the charkha, it was a common thing in the Punjab.
('98', 49, 8, 27, 112373) But I did not know about it.
('98', 49, 8, 28, 112402) And when women came and placed before me heaps and heaps of yarn it made me very happy.
('98', 49, 8, 29, 112490) I took a charkha from there.
('98', 49, 8, 30, 112519) The same thing I saw later in Gujarat.
('98', 49, 8, 31, 112558) By Gujarat I do not mean the Gujarat of Punjab which is a district and a town.
('98', 49, 8, 32, 112637) I am speaking of the Gujarat which is near Bombay.
('98', 49, 8, 33, 112688) Vijapur is a town in the Gaekwar State.
('98', 49, 8, 34, 112728) There was a woman worker there who used to

('98', 50, 1, 2, 112859) travel a good deal.
('98', 50, 1, 3, 112879) Her name was Gangabehn.
('98', 50, 1, 4, 112903) She came to know of my craze for the charkha.
('98', 50, 1, 5, 112949) She too went to Vijapur.
('98', 50, 1, 6, 112974) In Gujarat women, who lived in purdah and included both Muslims and Rajputs, used to spin.
('98', 50, 1, 7, 113065) But no one took notice of their spinning.
('98', 50, 1, 8, 113107) Gangabehn told them that she would buy all the yarn they could spin.
('98', 50, 1, 9, 113176) They then began to sell all their yarn to her.
('98', 50, 1, 10, 113223) Women would line upto go to her, give their yarn and take slivers from her.
('98', 50, 1, 11, 113299) I do not wish to go into the question of who made the slivers.
('98', 50, 1, 12, 113362) They also got some money from her.
('98', 50, 1, 13, 113397) Later, as we progressed, the amount of money the women received also increased.
('98', 50, 1, 14, 113477) In this way lakhs of homes could get some money earned by the women.
('98', 50, 1, 15, 113546) The charkha thus became very popular there and through this work of khadi the women were able to earn enough money for their food.
('98', 50, 1, 16, 113677) Their demands were small.
('98', 50, 1, 17, 113703) They did not ask for a daily wage of two rupees, or three rupees.
('98', 50, 1, 18, 113769) They got two pice and they were content.
('98', 50, 1, 19, 113810) When they got three or four they were more than satisfied.
('98', 50, 1, 20, 113869) Still later the progress was much more.
('98', 50, 1, 21, 113909) Afterwards when I thought over it I realized that the charkha had tremendous potentiality.
('98', 50, 1, 22, 114000) What is this power?
('98', 50, 1, 23, 114020) What can the charkha achieve?
('98', 50, 1, 24, 114050) The charkha represents the power of non violence.
('98', 50, 1, 25, 114100) If on the one side there is the armed might of the whole world and on the other the charkha plied by the chaste hands— not unworthy hands—of our women, the power of the charkha is greater.
('98', 50, 1, 26, 114289) You have all had a glimpse of that power.
('98', 50, 1, 27, 114331) I have had a little more of it.
('98', 50, 1, 28, 114363) But no one amongst us has known the whole of it.
('98', 50, 1, 29, 114412) People merely thought that the charkha was only for poor women.
('98', 50, 1, 30, 114476) That it certainly is.
('98', 50, 1, 31, 114498) But it is also a symbol of non violence.
('98', 50, 1, 32, 114539) If people knew this they would not burn the charkha.
('98', 50, 1, 33, 114592) Time was when the whole of India plied the charkha and it enjoyed pride of place.
('98', 50, 1, 34, 114674) There were no mills then either in India or anywhere else in the world.
('98', 50, 1, 35, 114746) Cotton textiles were sent to the outside world from India and there was a time when Dacca muslin known as shabnam 1 was very popular.
('98', 50, 1, 36, 114880) It was greatly valued by people outside India.
('98', 50, 1, 37, 114927) They appreciated its beauty.
('98', 50, 1, 38, 114956) I do not wish to go into all that history, though it is quite interesting.
('98', 50, 1, 39, 115031) Nevertheless at that time the charkha was a symbol of slavery, for women were then forced to give a certain quantity of yarn and this was done by order of the government.
('98', 50, 1, 40, 115202) And the Government was not a Muslim government but a Hindu government.
('98', 50, 1, 41, 115273) It is all described in the books written at the behest of the Hindu Government.
('98', 50, 1, 42, 115353) Later on Bengal passed into Muslim

('98', 51, 0, 1, 115406) 52 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 51, 1, 2, 115447) hands, but this system goes back to much earlier times.
('98', 51, 1, 3, 115503) The charkha then truly stood for slavery.
('98', 51, 1, 4, 115545) Women were forced to spin; they had to supply fixed quantities of yarn and they could not even ask to be paid for it.
('98', 51, 1, 5, 115663) The Government itself decided what little money was to be paid for their labour and when even that money was not paid the women could do nothing about it.
('98', 51, 1, 6, 115818) The attitude then prevalent was that after all women were born to do such work.
('98', 51, 1, 7, 115898) They should be thankful if they were paid just a little money for it.
('98', 51, 1, 8, 115968) It is a tragic history the way women were exploited and I do not wish to go into it.
('98', 51, 1, 9, 116053) The charkha which was then a symbol of slavery has been transformed into a symbol of our freedom, and that is what I have been shouting from the house tops.
('98', 51, 1, 10, 116210) During the Khilafat days the Ali Brothers were quick to seize on the charkha.
('98', 51, 1, 11, 116288) They said that we should now be able to gain a victory over England through the balls of yarn prepared by our women.
('98', 51, 1, 12, 116405) All we had to do was to fling the balls at those who imported cloth from England to sell it here.
('98', 51, 1, 13, 116503) This was in 1920. But the work of the charkha had been started perhaps in 1916. In 1919 1 I had toured the Punjab.
('98', 51, 1, 14, 116618) You may ask me why, although we have gained freedom, this storm is raging in India.
('98', 51, 1, 15, 116702) The reason for it is that in truth we have not embraced the charkha.
('98', 51, 1, 16, 116771) It is only women who have done some work in this direction.
('98', 51, 1, 17, 116831) They liked what I said because I am their friend and their servant.
('98', 51, 1, 18, 116899) Some of them came out from their seclusion after I entered the field.
('98', 51, 1, 19, 116969) Before that women would not attend meetings nor speak at meetings.
('98', 51, 1, 20, 117036) So women were kind to me and they took up the charkha.
('98', 51, 1, 21, 117091) But if they had taken up the charkha not out of kindness to me but in the knowledge that the charkha would give them strength and give India strength, we would not have been in the predicament we are in today.
('98', 51, 1, 22, 117301) We have to develop in us the power that non violence alone can give.
('98', 51, 1, 23, 117370) For that we shall once again have to adopt the charkha.
('98', 51, 1, 24, 117426) Today we have forgotten the charkha.
('98', 51, 1, 25, 117463) We shall have to accept the charkha with all that it stands for.
('98', 51, 1, 26, 117528) Only then can we sing the glory of the tri colour.
('98', 51, 1, 27, 117579) That is why we have the charkha in the middle of the tri colour though of course now the figure has been reduced to a wheel and we find a different interpretation for it.
('98', 51, 1, 28, 117750) 2 That interpretation
('98', 51, 2, 29, 117772) 1 Gandhiji had toured the Punjab in October December 1919. 2 Attributing great significance to the Chakra, Prof.
('98', 51, 2, 30, 117885) Radha Kumud Mookerjee traced its origin to Lord Vishnu’s Sudarshan Chakra—the Cosmic Circle, comprehending all that is animate or inanimate.
('98', 51, 2, 31, 118026) The Buddha called it the Dhamma Chakka—the Wheel of Righteousness—which was later adopted by Emperor Ashoka as the State symbol.
('98', 52, 0, 1, 118155) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 53
('98', 52, 1, 2, 118201) is not bad.
('98', 52, 1, 3, 118213) The idea behind the three colours was that the Hindus, Muslims and others should work together and the idea of having the charkha on it was that such work should be pursued through the charkha.
('98', 52, 1, 4, 118407) Today we have a larger army.
('98', 52, 1, 5, 118436) We are trying to augment it further.
('98', 52, 1, 6, 118473) Our expenditure on the army has increased enormously.
('98', 52, 1, 7, 118527) What if the British are no longer here.
('98', 52, 1, 8, 118567) It is a tragedy and a shame.
('98', 52, 1, 9, 118596) For so long we fought through the charkha and the moment we have power in our hands we forget it.
('98', 52, 1, 10, 118694) Today we look up to the army.
('98', 52, 1, 11, 118724) It is because we have forgotten the charkha that we indulge in mutual fighting.
('98', 52, 1, 12, 118804) Our mistake was to imagine that the charkha was a thing only for women.
('98', 52, 1, 13, 118876) When I told the Sikhs and Muslims of the Punjab to ply the charkha they were shocked.
('98', 52, 1, 14, 118962) Could the charkha be for men?
('98', 52, 1, 15, 118992) Men had swords in their hands.
('98', 52, 1, 16, 119023) I merely laughed.
('98', 52, 1, 17, 119041) Later a few Sikhs and Muslims accepted my advice and began to spin quite well.
('98', 52, 1, 18, 119120) But still I must say that the charkha has not made for itself a home in the Punjab.
('98', 52, 1, 19, 119204) But I do not want them to take up the charkha out of kindness to me.
('98', 52, 1, 20, 119273) They may well burn the charkha and give up wearing khadi.
('98', 52, 1, 21, 119331) The charkha being a symbol of non violence and a repository of great power, it is an emblem of courage.
('98', 52, 1, 22, 119435) Let us embrace that ahimsa with deliberation and with all our heart and intellect.
('98', 52, 1, 23, 119518) Then no one can take it away from us.
('98', 52, 1, 24, 119556) If the ten crore adults in our country take to spinning there can never be a famine of cloth in India.
('98', 52, 1, 25, 119659) We produce a great quantity of cotton and we can earn crores of rupees.
('98', 52, 1, 26, 119731) The important thing is that no military force can stand up to the power created by crores of people working together.
('98', 52, 1, 27, 119849) It is my fault, not that of ahimsa, if I cannot prove that.
('98', 52, 1, 28, 119909) That is because I am lacking in tapashcharya.
('98', 52, 1, 29, 119955) But you cannot say that ahimsa does not have the power.
('98', 52, 1, 30, 120011) That power can find the fullest expression through the charkha.
('98', 52, 1, 31, 120075) If the millions do not ply the charkha, the loss is obvious.
('98', 52, 1, 32, 120136) only a few lakhs of people can be employed by the mills.
('98', 52, 1, 33, 120193) What occupation shall we provide for the hundreds of millions?
('98', 52, 1, 34, 120256) This is what you have to consider.
('98', 52, 1, 35, 120291) This is a supreme economic as well as moral question.

('98', 53, 5, 7, 120697) NEW DELHI, December 14, 1947
('98', 53, 6, 8, 120726) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, As I was coming to the prayer, I received a note saying that a Muslim friend of the writer had been forced to go away to Pakistan.
('98', 53, 6, 9, 120879) The friend had left with the writer of the note some gold and silver bought with the earnings of his own labour.
('98', 53, 6, 10, 120992) He wants to know how it is to be sent to its owner in Pakistan, who however has not given his name and address in Pakistan.
('98', 53, 6, 11, 121116) If he furnishes the particulars I shall pass on the gold and silver to the Government to be sent to the person concerned.
('98', 53, 6, 12, 121238) Till he is traced the property can remain with the Government.
('98', 53, 6, 13, 121301) It is gratifying to know that notwithstanding all that has happened there are still among us Hindus and Muslims between whom fraternal feelings continue to exist and who do not covet what belongs to their friends of the other community.
('98', 53, 6, 14, 121538) If everyone was like this the misfortune that has befallen us would soon be overcome.
('98', 53, 6, 15, 121624) I told you I would be reporting to you briefly whatever took place at the meetings of various Sanghs being held in the Harijan Colony.
('98', 53, 6, 16, 121759) Yesterday I told you about the Charkha Sangh and its activities of spinning and weaving.
('98', 53, 6, 17, 121848) I have to tell you now about village industries and Nayee Talim.
('98', 53, 6, 18, 121913) I shall deal with Nayee Talim today.
('98', 53, 6, 19, 121950) Nayee Talim is not a thing with which everyone is acquainted, though the work has been going on now for seven or eight years.
('98', 53, 7, 20, 122076) 1 The letter is not reproduced here.
('98', 53, 7, 21, 122113) The correspondent had rejected the explanation suggested by Richard B. Gregg, for the recent violence in India.
('98', 53, 7, 22, 122225) Vide “A Psychological Explanation”, 11 11 1947.
('98', 54, 0, 1, 122273) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 55
('98', 54, 1, 2, 122319) Nayee Talim consists in imparting all instructions through some handicrafts.
('98', 54, 1, 3, 122396) The idea in a way has much deeper roots.
('98', 54, 1, 4, 122437) The argument is that no education is true education unless it is founded in truth and non violence.
('98', 54, 1, 5, 122537) A man may have acquired all the learning, understood the essence of all the scriptures, may have studied Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian, but, as the Sanskrit saying 1 goes, unless he has acquired true wisdom all his education has been in vain.
('98', 54, 1, 6, 122779) By true wisdom is meant that which leads us to mukti.
('98', 54, 1, 7, 122833) There are of course various kinds of mukti.
('98', 54, 1, 8, 122877) There is release from the bondage of action, release from the clutches of a tyrant, release of a girl from the hands of a maniac, and liberation of the country from foreign yoke.
('98', 54, 1, 9, 123056) The makti meant here is the liberation from all the ills of the world.
('98', 54, 1, 10, 123127) Education that is not rooted in truth and non violence is no education in the proper sense of the word.
('98', 54, 1, 11, 123231) There are so many instances of people who were highly learned and yet were satanic in their pursuits.
('98', 54, 1, 12, 123333) One famous instance is that of Ravana.
('98', 54, 1, 13, 123372) Ravana possessed great learning and his penance too was great.
('98', 54, 1, 14, 123435) And yet because his pursuits were demoniac he perished, whereas Rama lives even today.
('98', 54, 1, 15, 123522) We regard Rama as a manifestation of the Supreme Lord.
('98', 54, 1, 16, 123577) So in order to acquire true wealth of learning we must cultivate truth and non violence.
('98', 54, 1, 17, 123666) The discussion at the meeting centred round the question of the method of giving such education.
('98', 54, 1, 18, 123763) It could not obviously be imparted through books.
('98', 54, 1, 19, 123813) Then what should be done?
('98', 54, 1, 20, 123839) Millions of people in the country pursue some handicraft.
('98', 54, 1, 21, 123897) They cannot all be rich.
('98', 54, 1, 22, 123922) Even in America everyone is not rich.
('98', 54, 1, 23, 123960) True, the poverty there is of a different order but the hardships attendant on poverty are similar.
('98', 54, 1, 24, 124060) In the same way various other ills widespread in India also exist there.
('98', 54, 1, 25, 124133) With all their wealth and all their learning they have not been able to overcome these.
('98', 54, 1, 26, 124221) I thought that if the millions were to be given education it could be done only through handicraft.
('98', 54, 1, 27, 124321) If among a population of hundreds of millions a lakh or two have secured what now passes for education, what good can it do?
('98', 54, 1, 28, 124446) And if everyone tried to have that education we would go bankrupt.
('98', 54, 1, 29, 124513) The real system of education is one where the children of rich and poor, of king and subject, receive education through crafts.
('98', 54, 1, 30, 124641) And this cannot be done unless we adhere to truth and non violence.
('98', 54, 1, 31, 124709) It becomes a question of religion here—not religion in a sectarian sense but religion in a universal sense.
('98', 54, 1, 32, 124817) Such religion is eternal.
('98', 54, 1, 33, 124843) It cannot change.
('98', 54, 1, 34, 124861) It is for all, as much for Hindus as for Muslims.
('98', 54, 1, 35, 124911) One cannot
('98', 55, 0, 1, 124922) 56 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 55, 1, 2, 124963) say that Hindus should speak the truth and Muslims should tell lies.
('98', 55, 1, 3, 125032) It is in the interest of all to speak the truth.
('98', 55, 1, 4, 125081) It is no one’s religious duty to commit violence.
('98', 55, 1, 5, 125131) If someone asks me whether Sikhs and Muslims may not receive Nayee Talim I shall say that if Sikhs and Muslims both declare that they are votaries of violence then certainly Nayee Talim would not be for them.
('98', 55, 1, 6, 125340) Nayee Talim is not the special province of any one sect.
('98', 55, 1, 7, 125397) I have studied all religions and assimilated their essence.
('98', 55, 1, 8, 125457) Muslims and Sikhs both come and sit beside me.
('98', 55, 1, 9, 125504) They advocate violence only where all other methods fail.
('98', 55, 1, 10, 125562) But when we initiate a child into education we should begin by teaching him how to die rather than kill.
('98', 55, 1, 11, 125667) We therefore decided that if we had to conduct Nayee Talim it had to be in this way.
('98', 55, 1, 12, 125752) Those carrying it on must stand by truth and non violence.
('98', 55, 1, 13, 125811) Only then can it succeed.
('98', 55, 1, 14, 125837) But I do not know if it is so now.
('98', 55, 1, 15, 125872) I cannot read anyone’s heart.
('98', 55, 1, 16, 125902) I am also not a prophet.
('98', 55, 1, 17, 125927) The reins of Nayee Talim are not in my hands.
('98', 55, 1, 18, 125973) All I can do is to offer advice when asked.
('98', 55, 1, 19, 126017) True, I conceived the idea.
('98', 55, 1, 20, 126045) But the organization itself was formed by the Congress.
('98', 55, 1, 21, 126101) Zakir Husain is its President.
('98', 55, 1, 22, 126132) If he does not hold by truth and non violence he should resign.
('98', 55, 1, 23, 126196) But I have never known him to be guilty of falsehood or violence.
('98', 55, 1, 24, 126262) He is associated with me only because he does not believe in violence.
('98', 55, 1, 25, 126333) The Secretaries of the Hindustani Talimi Sangh are Aryanayakum and his wife.
('98', 55, 1, 26, 126410) They too are votaries of truth and non violence.
('98', 55, 1, 27, 126459) I am busy otherwise and they have to run the scheme.
('98', 55, 1, 28, 126512) They are the moving spirit behind Nayee Talim.
('98', 55, 1, 29, 126559) It is not even Zakir Saheb.
('98', 55, 1, 30, 126587) He is only the President.
('98', 55, 1, 31, 126613) If Aryanayakum and Asha Devi abandoned it the scheme would collapse.
('98', 55, 1, 32, 126682) It is not an organization which can run on its own.
('98', 55, 1, 33, 126734) Take the Congress for instance.
('98', 55, 1, 34, 126766) I am of course out of it.
('98', 55, 1, 35, 126792) But even if Jawaharlal, the Sardar and Rajendra Babu go out of it the Congress will go on.
('98', 55, 1, 36, 126883) Or take the Charkha Sangh.
('98', 55, 1, 37, 126910) I am its President.
('98', 55, 1, 38, 126930) If I leave it, its work will go on, for it is an organization that has existed for many years.
('98', 55, 1, 39, 127025) But that is not so with Nayee Talim.
('98', 55, 1, 40, 127062) It has yet to establish itself well.
('98', 55, 1, 41, 127099) It will be well established when those running it have the qualities of the sthitaprajna described in the Gita 1. We must find an activity in which everyone can participate.
('98', 55, 1, 42, 127273) I want to tell you that handicrafts alone provide such activity.

('98', 56, 3, 5, 127566) I am sending the article on railways 1 after revising it.
('98', 56, 3, 6, 127624) I feel a trace of violence in what you have suggested.
('98', 56, 3, 7, 127679) Read what St. Paul says about charity 2. I am doing that, too, in my own way.
('98', 56, 3, 8, 127757) Though I am a friend of the Ministers, I am not a Minister.

('98', 56, 6, 17, 128227) 41. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING 4
('98', 56, 7, 18, 128258) NEW DELHI, December 15, 1947
('98', 56, 8, 19, 128287) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, I was pained to read in the papers that the refugees have forcibly occupied the buildings of six municipal schools and have so far resisted all attempts of the New Delhi Municipal Committee to make them vacate the buildings.
('98', 56, 8, 20, 128534) The Municipality, one understands, is now seeking police help in the matter.
('98', 56, 8, 21, 128611) This episode is an instance of shameless rowdyism.
('98', 56, 8, 22, 128662) In the capital city of India such happenings are a cause for great shame.
('98', 56, 8, 23, 128736) I hope those responsible for this will repent and leave the school premises.
('98', 56, 9, 24, 128813) 1 The article was published under the title “Democratize Our Railways” in Harijan, 21 12 1947. 2 I Corinthians, ch.
('98', 56, 9, 25, 128929) 13 3 Ten volumes of Gandhiji’s writings in Gujarati edited by the addressee.
('98', 56, 9, 26, 129006) For Gandhiji’s foreword to it, vide “Foreword”, before 29 7 1946. 4 As Gandhiji was observing silence, his written speech was read out at the meeting.
('98', 57, 0, 1, 129157) 58 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 57, 1, 2, 129198) they do not, I hope their friends will try to make them see reason and the authorities will not be forced to carry out its threat.
('98', 57, 1, 3, 129329) It is a general complaint against the refugees that in spite of all their tribulations they have not become sober, responsible and industrious citizens.
('98', 57, 1, 4, 129482) Let us hope that the refugees in general and those who have forcibly occupied schools will repent and prove that the complaint is not justified.
('98', 57, 1, 5, 129627) On Saturday 1 I referred to the rowdyism in Calcutta.
('98', 57, 1, 6, 129681) Those indulging in rowdyism there were not refugees.
('98', 57, 1, 7, 129734) The incident had a different background too.
('98', 57, 1, 8, 129779) It is the duty of all leading men, whatever their persuasion or party, to safeguard the dignity of India.
('98', 57, 1, 9, 129885) India’s dignity cannot be saved if misgovernment and corruption flourish.
('98', 57, 1, 10, 129959) I mention corruption because misgovernment and corruption always go together.
('98', 57, 1, 11, 130037) I have it from very trustworthy sources that corruption is increasing in the country.
('98', 57, 1, 12, 130123) Is everyone then going to think only of himself, not at all of India?
('98', 57, 1, 13, 130193) A correspondent writes:
('98', 57, 2, 14, 130217) I have just been listening to your prayer speech of yesterday on the radio.
('98', 57, 2, 15, 130293) You say some Muslims from U. P. who have been to Lahore, have assured you on behalf of the Pakistan Government that non Muslims, and in particular Hindus, can go back there and resume their businesses.
('98', 57, 2, 16, 130495) In the first place to invite only the Hindus and not the Sikhs shows cunning and is intended to create a breach between Hindus and Sikhs.
('98', 57, 2, 17, 130633) Such assurances are treacherous.
('98', 57, 2, 18, 130666) They are a mockery.
('98', 57, 2, 19, 130686) only persons like you can be taken in by such talk from the Muslims.
('98', 57, 2, 20, 130755) I send you a cutting from The Hindustan Times of December 11. It will tell you something about the sincerity and truthfulness of the Pakistan Government.
('98', 57, 2, 21, 130909) Will you still say that the Muslims who come to you are honest people?
('98', 57, 2, 22, 130980) All they are concerned about is to make you believe that the Pakistan Government is just to the minorities and all is well in that country, although facts speak otherwise.
('98', 57, 2, 23, 131152) If those Muslim gentlemen come to you again, please show them the cutting.
('98', 57, 2, 24, 131227) I am sure you will not have forgotten what befell the Hindus and Sikhs who had gone to Lahore on November 20 last to take out their valuables from the bank.
('98', 57, 2, 25, 131384) The armed units escorting them were attacked in the presence of responsible Government officers of Pakistan who did nothing to stop the attackers.
('98', 57, 2, 26, 131531) The cutting says:
('98', 57, 3, 27, 131549) According to a report recently published in the Civil and Military
('98', 57, 4, 28, 131616) 1 December 12
('98', 58, 0, 1, 131630) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 59
('98', 58, 1, 2, 131676) Gazette of Lahore, non Muslim traders and shopkeepers who had left Pakistan during the riots are coming back in the hope of resuming their trades, after an interval of months.
('98', 58, 1, 3, 131852) But before they are given back the possession of their shops they are made to sign such impossible conditions that many had to go back disappointed.
('98', 58, 1, 4, 132001) The Rehabilitation Commissioner has laid down the following conditions for letting people reopen their shops:
('98', 58, 2, 5, 132111) 1. The proprietor or owner will keep a full account of sales.
('98', 58, 3, 6, 132173) 2. He will not transfer cash or commodities from one place to another without prior permission of the Government.
('98', 58, 4, 7, 132287) 3. He will give an undertaking to keep his shop as a going concern.
('98', 58, 5, 8, 132355) 4. He will deposit in a bank the daily proceeds from sales.
('98', 58, 6, 9, 132415) 5. He will live permanently in Lahore.
('98', 58, 7, 10, 132454) No conditions are laid down for the Muslims.
('98', 58, 7, 11, 132499) Then why these conditions for the Hindus?
('98', 58, 7, 12, 132541) The Hindus say they cannot abide by the conditions.
('98', 58, 7, 13, 132593) So they go back disappointed.
('98', 58, 7, 14, 132623) I have already spoken of the possibility of disappointment and even if the report is accurate it does not necessarily follow that what the Muslim friends told me is false.
('98', 58, 7, 15, 132795) The persons concerned have not only to think of their own position but they have to think of India, whose representatives they are, and of Pakistan which has given them the assurances.
('98', 58, 7, 16, 132980) I may say that the Muslim friends concerned keep in touch with me.
('98', 58, 7, 17, 133047) They came to see me today too.
('98', 58, 7, 18, 133078) But I was observing silence and writing my prayer message and so could not see them.
('98', 58, 7, 19, 133163) They sent me word that they were not sitting idle but working for their mission.
('98', 58, 7, 20, 133244) My advice to the correspondent is not to be so full of distrust and so sensitive.
('98', 58, 7, 21, 133326) He will lose nothing by trusting.
('98', 58, 7, 22, 133360) Distrust eats up a man.
('98', 58, 7, 23, 133384) He should behave with discretion.
('98', 58, 7, 24, 133418) For myself I can only say that I do not regret what I have done.
('98', 58, 7, 25, 133483) All my life I have trusted in people with my eyes open.
('98', 58, 7, 26, 133539) I shall continue to trust the Muslim friends till it is proved that they cannot be trusted.
('98', 58, 7, 27, 133631) Trust begets trust.
('98', 58, 7, 28, 133651) It gives one the strength to face treachery.
('98', 58, 7, 29, 133696) If refugees from both sides are to go back to their homes the way for it is the way I have adopted and am following.
('98', 58, 7, 30, 133813) The correspondent’s suspicion that it is a trick to create a split between the Hindus and the Sikhs is wrong.
('98', 58, 7, 31, 133923) I had even mentioned to the Muslim friends the possibility of their assurance being given such prejudicial construction.
('98', 58, 7, 32, 134044) They denied vehemently that there was any trickery in it.
('98', 58, 7, 33, 134102) I see nothing wrong in a path being paved for those wishing to return.
('98', 58, 7, 34, 134173) It cannot be denied that there is more poison in Pakistan for Sikhs than for Hindus but the Hindus and
('98', 59, 0, 1, 134276) 60 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 59, 1, 2, 134317) Sikhs have to swim or, sink together.
('98', 59, 1, 3, 134355) They should harbour no malice.
('98', 59, 1, 4, 134386) Intriguers cannot have sincere amity among themselves.
('98', 59, 1, 5, 134441) A correspondent from East Pakistan says:
('98', 59, 2, 6, 134482) Now that India has been partitioned how can you call yourself a citizen of united India?
('98', 59, 2, 7, 134571) Now what belongs to one Dominion cannot belong to the other.
('98', 59, 2, 8, 134632) Whatever the legal pundits may say they cannot rule the hearts of men.
('98', 59, 2, 9, 134703) Who can prevent the correspondent from saying that he is a citizen of the world?
('98', 59, 2, 10, 134784) Legally that is not the case and some countries have laws that would prevent him from entering those countries.
('98', 59, 2, 11, 134896) But if one has not been reduced to an automation, as some of us have not been, what does it matter to one what one’s legal status is?
('98', 59, 2, 12, 135030) So long as we are morally on the right path we do not have to worry.
('98', 59, 2, 13, 135099) What we have to take care of is that we do not nurse enmity towards anyone or any country.
('98', 59, 2, 14, 135190) For instance no one who harbours enmity towards Muslims or Pakistan can claim to be a citizen of both Pakistan and India.
('98', 59, 2, 15, 135312) If such feeling of enmity spreads it will end up in a war breaking out between the two countries.
('98', 59, 2, 16, 135410) Every country will treat as traitors those of its citizens who harbour malice towards it and help a foreign country.
('98', 59, 2, 17, 135527) Loyalty is indivisible.

('98', 61, 2, 3, 137617) NEW DELHI, December 16, 1947
('98', 61, 3, 4, 137646) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, I am told— and to some extent it is true—that controls on certain articles of food and clothing have been removed and will be removed from more articles.
('98', 61, 3, 5, 137822) There is now no doubt that controls are on the way out and Brijkishan has told me of its very first consequence.
('98', 61, 3, 6, 137935) Gur, which used to be sold at Re.
('98', 61, 3, 7, 137969) 1 a seer is now available at 8 [annas] a seer.
('98', 61, 3, 8, 138016) This is some achievement.
('98', 61, 3, 9, 138042) Of course the price should be still lower.
('98', 61, 3, 10, 138085) When I was young no one could have dreamt that gur would ever become so dear.
('98', 61, 3, 11, 138163) A seer of it could be had for one anna or less.
('98', 61, 3, 12, 138211) We should therefore hope that the price of this commodity will further fall.
('98', 61, 3, 13, 138288) No doubt we cannot have it free of cost.
('98', 61, 3, 14, 138329) Similarly, sugar has come down from Rs. 32 to Rs. 20 a maund.
('98', 61, 3, 15, 138391) Moong 1, urad 2 and arhar 3 are now sold at 1_ seers for a rupee.
('98', 61, 3, 16, 138457) The same is true of gram.
('98', 61, 3, 17, 138483) Gram, in my opinion, is included in the pulses, but in this region it has various special uses and so it is kept separate.
('98', 61, 3, 18, 138606) It used to sell at Rs. 24 a maund.
('98', 61, 3, 19, 138641) Now the price is Rs. 18. The black market price of wheat used to be Rs. 34 a maund.
('98', 61, 3, 20, 138725) It is now Rs. 24. The same goes for other articles.
('98', 61, 3, 21, 138777) People used to frighten me that I did not know how markets were operated, how prices rose and fell, that I did not know economics, that I was saying what I did because I was a mahatma and did not have to suffer the consequences of decontrol; it was the poor who would have to suffer.
('98', 61, 3, 22, 139061) But from the first results of decontrol I see that the people will live rather than die through the measure.
('98', 61, 3, 23, 139170) I shall therefore say that control on maize, barley and millet should also be lifted.
('98', 61, 3, 24, 139256) Because those who are used to millet will continue to eat millet.
('98', 61, 3, 25, 139322) They will not be able to digest wheat.
('98', 61, 3, 26, 139361) Similarly there are many whose staple diet is maize.
('98', 61, 3, 27, 139414) I thus see no reason why control on these articles should continue.
('98', 61, 3, 28, 139482) Dr. Rajendra Prasad too had promised that gradually all controls would be lifted.
('98', 61, 3, 29, 139564) We have seen the desirable consequences of some controls being lifted.
('98', 61, 3, 30, 139635) Now take match boxes.
('98', 61, 3, 31, 139657) One has to pay an exorbitant price for a box of matches in the black market, which is really the open market.
('98', 61, 3, 32, 139767) There is no doubt that if it is decontrolled it will have a very good
('98', 61, 4, 33, 139837) 1 Varieties of pulses 2 ibid

('98', 62, 1, 2, 139912) effect.
('98', 62, 1, 3, 139920) Match boxes never used to be so costly.
('98', 62, 1, 4, 139960) In my time it cost almost nothing.
('98', 62, 1, 5, 139995) Today a box of matches is sold, maybe, for one anna.
('98', 62, 1, 6, 140048) Then one got a whole dozen for that price.
('98', 62, 1, 7, 140091) Things were never so costly as they are now.
('98', 62, 1, 8, 140136) I am happy when people’s incomes rise but the rise in prices always distresses me.
('98', 62, 1, 9, 140219) If the prices rise the excess should go to the toiler, but even then prices cannot rise so steeply.
('98', 62, 1, 10, 140319) This happens when traders turn wicked and greedy and want to pocket as much profit as they can.
('98', 62, 1, 11, 140415) We have got our independence and we have been through a great calamity also, but still we have not learnt purity of conduct.
('98', 62, 1, 12, 140540) If our traders content themselves with what is a just profit, I have not the least fear that decontrol will lead to a rise in prices.
('98', 62, 1, 13, 140674) Even those who have such a fear attribute it to the fact that we are wicked and dishonest.
('98', 62, 1, 14, 140765) Traders care only for their profits and the farmers and other producers too are only concerned with filling their own bellies and nobody bothers about the consumers.
('98', 62, 1, 15, 140931) If that is so, how can one say that there is democracy in India?
('98', 62, 1, 16, 140996) How can such things be permitted in a democracy?
('98', 62, 1, 17, 141045) In a democracy it is incumbent on the Government to trust the people.
('98', 62, 1, 18, 141115) It must clearly say that it will do as the people desire but that if what they desire brings them hardships it cannot be held responsible.
('98', 62, 1, 19, 141254) True, we have a Civil Service, but all of us who are here should consider ourselves soldiers and serve the people.
('98', 62, 1, 20, 141369) Today malpractices flourish.
('98', 62, 1, 21, 141398) I am continuously receiving telegrams, etc., from everywhere.
('98', 62, 1, 22, 141460) I understand there are some fishy practices going on in Bombay though I do not know exactly what.
('98', 62, 1, 23, 141558) This should stop.
('98', 62, 1, 24, 141576) But the people should congratulate the Government for the good work that has so far been done.
('98', 62, 1, 25, 141671) It also encourages it.
('98', 62, 1, 26, 141694) So much for the lifting of controls.
('98', 62, 1, 27, 141731) There is then the matter of the [Indian] Civil Service.
('98', 62, 1, 28, 141787) I am receiving letters every day complaining of the expenditure still being incurred on the Civil Service.
('98', 62, 1, 29, 141894) How can all I. C. S. men be removed all at once?
('98', 62, 1, 30, 141943) And if they were, how would the work go on?
('98', 62, 1, 31, 141987) Some have already gone and some others, who are soon to go, are having to do much hard work.
('98', 62, 1, 32, 142080) The I. C. S. is in the charge of the Sardar.
('98', 62, 1, 33, 142125) He praises that cadre very highly.
('98', 62, 1, 34, 142160) Although they are few in number the I. C. S. men deserve to be complimented for the work they do.
('98', 62, 1, 35, 142258) They no doubt receive high salaries.
('98', 62, 1, 36, 142295) Still, it is we who constitute the real Civil Service.
('98', 62, 1, 37, 142350) Let the Government accept us as the Civil Servants and, in order to enforce discipline, punish us as it does the Civil Servants.
('98', 62, 1, 38, 142479) Let it summon any one of us and say he has to do such and such work.
('98', 62, 1, 39, 142548) Is not there a law to punish those guilty of misconduct?
('98', 62, 1, 40, 142605) If there is none, I shall say they should frame one.
('98', 62, 1, 41, 142658) They should place on the whole
('98', 63, 0, 1, 142689) 64 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 63, 1, 2, 142730) people the responsibility they have placed on the Civil Service.
('98', 63, 1, 3, 142795) It is after all a people’s government.
('98', 63, 1, 4, 142834) Why do I have to say this?
('98', 63, 1, 5, 142861) Because there has been a fresh development; the Congress has said that there should be a Parlia mentary Secretary attached to each Minister, and these Parliamentary Secretaries should be not from among the I. C. S. officers but from the ranks of the Congress or from among those supporting the Congress.
('98', 63, 1, 6, 143165) Of course they will not work gratis.
('98', 63, 1, 7, 143202) They will have to be paid salaries.
('98', 63, 1, 8, 143238) If today we did not control the Government with its immense financial resources, how could we have paid these salaries?
('98', 63, 1, 9, 143358) But since we control the Government we must pay one a salary of Rs. 1,500 or Rs. 2,000, give him a house and other benefits, and call him a Parliamentary Secretary.
('98', 63, 1, 10, 143523) I must say it pains me—be it a Parliamentary Secretary attached to the Prime Minister or to the Home Minister or any other Minister.
('98', 63, 1, 11, 143656) Even if the Parliament —or rather the Congress Party—insists on creating such a post, does one have to work only for a salary?
('98', 63, 1, 12, 143783) In that case India will become a worthless country.
('98', 63, 1, 13, 143835) Was our strength born only today?
('98', 63, 1, 14, 143869) Let us first produce some results.
('98', 63, 1, 15, 143904) Let us sit down and assess how much we have produced in excess of what was produced till August 14. Have we produced more grain, more cloth, more industrial goods?
('98', 63, 1, 16, 144068) When people become industrious, earn money and become prosperous so that they can be generous in giving, then we can say that lustre has been added to India’s name and its worth has gone up.
('98', 63, 1, 17, 144259) But today our per capita income is only Rs. 70. This is nothing.
('98', 63, 1, 18, 144324) When this has doubled or risen even further and the rural incomes have also risen you can then ask the Government to pay more.
('98', 63, 1, 19, 144451) But if our production does not increase and we go on increasing our expenditure, where shall we be?
('98', 63, 1, 20, 144551) Take for instance a shop—and India is only a large shop—whose proprietor seeks from the manager an account of the sales every evening.
('98', 63, 1, 21, 144686) If he is told the sale today has been worth Rs. 1,000 while yesterday it was worth only Rs. 500 he is pleased.
('98', 63, 1, 22, 144797) But when he is told that the expenditure has been of the order of Rs. 1,500, he will fly into a rage and start shouting at the manager.
('98', 63, 1, 23, 144933) Shouting and abusing is bad no doubt and so is getting angry, but his point is well taken.
('98', 63, 1, 24, 145024) If the income is Rs. 1,000 and the expenditure Rs. 1,500, where is he to find the Rs. 500 to balance the books?
('98', 63, 1, 25, 145136) Today we have the money, so we go on a spree.
('98', 63, 1, 26, 145182) Tomorrow it will be gone.
('98', 63, 1, 27, 145208) It therefore pains me when we throw money away so recklessly.
('98', 63, 1, 28, 145270) This will do for today.

('98', 65, 10, 22, 147354) But those whose presence is not needed there should be asked to go back to their business.
('98', 65, 10, 23, 147445) Keep them all well informed.

('98', 66, 3, 4, 147953) I am passing through a difficult time.
('98', 66, 3, 5, 147992) I have not a moment to spare.
('98', 66, 3, 6, 148022) I am convinced that this communal conflict is not of the common people’s making.
('98', 66, 3, 7, 148103) A handful of persons are behind it.
('98', 66, 3, 8, 148139) Whose fault is it if I do not see amity even between these two.
('98', 66, 3, 9, 148203) 1 If the ocean itself catches fire, who can put it out?
('98', 66, 3, 10, 148259) Falsehood has spread so much that one cannot say where it will end.
('98', 66, 3, 11, 148327) If in that yajna, our struggle for freedom, we had been wholly negligent in preserving truth it is doubtful that we could have attained even this so called swarajya.
('98', 66, 3, 12, 148493) Truth is my only God.
('98', 66, 3, 13, 148515) Truth alone to me is prayer, penance and the rest.
('98', 66, 3, 14, 148566) I am a Hindu.
('98', 66, 3, 15, 148580) I know that if the world were to adopt my Hinduism mankind would be free from all the worldly ills and man would live in a truly human manner.
('98', 66, 3, 16, 148723) All this that I have dictated for you has just occurred to me after the prayer.
('98', 66, 3, 17, 148803) My health is all right.
('98', 66, 3, 18, 148827) It is no small mercy of God that even under such heavy burden of work the body continues to be fit.

('98', 67, 2, 3, 149144) December 17, 1947
('98', 67, 3, 4, 149162) I have your letter and invitation.
('98', 67, 3, 5, 149197) I love being among students because I consider myself a student.
('98', 67, 3, 6, 149262) But at present I am trapped here.
('98', 67, 3, 7, 149296) Still, this too is a big school.
('98', 67, 3, 8, 149329) I am being schooled here and am staying here for my examination.
('98', 67, 3, 9, 149394) Whether I pass or not is in the hands of God.
('98', 67, 3, 10, 149440) Both are the same to me.
('98', 67, 3, 11, 149465) You should take your examination in the same spirit.
('98', 67, 3, 12, 149518) I do not mean that you should only read books for your examination.
('98', 67, 3, 13, 149586) I can say from experience that so long as our schools do not impart lessons in moral uplift there can be no awakening amongst us.
('98', 67, 3, 14, 149716) Today the atmosphere in colleges and schools is not pure.
('98', 67, 3, 15, 149774) First of all it should be purified.
('98', 67, 3, 16, 149810) Today, though the students read so many books and spend so much money they are not free from anxiety, because they are not self reliant.
('98', 67, 3, 17, 149947) I want to change this pitiable condition and I want the students’ help in this.
('98', 67, 3, 18, 150027) We shall remain crippled as long as we do not conduct our universities through crafts.
('98', 67, 3, 19, 150114) Now swarajya has come.
('98', 67, 3, 20, 150137) Let us all be brothers and sisters.
('98', 67, 3, 21, 150173) Let no one be high and no one low.
('98', 67, 3, 22, 150208) Let there be no Hindus, no Parsis, no Christians and no Jews.
('98', 67, 3, 23, 150270) We should realize that we are only Indians, and that religion is a private matter.

('98', 67, 8, 28, 150434) NEW DELHI, December 17, 1947
('98', 67, 9, 29, 150463) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, A friend who is living in Hoshiarpur, maybe he belongs there, has asked me a number of questions.
('98', 67, 9, 30, 150583) He has given his name, but I do not wish to disclose it.
('98', 67, 9, 31, 150640) I shall leave his questions too.
('98', 67, 9, 32, 150673) He says before the partition the Punjab was one, so that if someone had his business in one part he had his house and property in another.
('98', 67, 9, 33, 150812) This friend had
('98', 68, 0, 1, 150828) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 69
('98', 68, 1, 2, 150874) his business in West Punjab, while his house and property were in East Punjab.
('98', 68, 1, 3, 150953) He had to flee West Punjab along with thousands of others.
('98', 68, 1, 4, 151012) He thought since he had his property in East Punjab he would be able to carry on his business there.
('98', 68, 1, 5, 151113) But he found on his arrival there that his house had been occupied by a Government official.
('98', 68, 1, 6, 151206) He was given only two rooms, the rest being kept by the official.
('98', 68, 1, 7, 151272) It would appear that it is a large house.
('98', 68, 1, 8, 151314) He asks if he is not entitled to get back his house.
('98', 68, 1, 9, 151367) If he does not get it back, will the Government help him or must he then go to court?
('98', 68, 1, 10, 151453) In my opinion he should be given back the house.
('98', 68, 1, 11, 151502) Why should litigation be forced on him?
('98', 68, 1, 12, 151542) If the occupant is a Government official, it is all the more necessary for the house to be returned to its owner.
('98', 68, 1, 13, 151656) As I had occasion to mention earlier, refugees tend to occupy any vacant premises anywhere, even breaking locks where they happen to be locked.
('98', 68, 1, 14, 151800) So long as someone lives as a tenant in a house and pays rent it is all right.
('98', 68, 1, 15, 151879) But how can he continue to live there when the owner of the house returns to the house?
('98', 68, 1, 16, 151967) He can only stay there if he arrives at some understanding with the owner, but it cannot be that he should retain the major portion of the house and the owner should become a guest in his own house.
('98', 68, 1, 17, 152166) But the refugees are not in the position of tenants.
('98', 68, 1, 18, 152219) All that they can say for themselves is that they have been forced out of their houses.
('98', 68, 1, 19, 152307) Does it give them the right to occupy any property?
('98', 68, 1, 20, 152359) If such property happens to be the house of a Muslim, then all is over.
('98', 68, 1, 21, 152431) Refugees think it is theirs by right.
('98', 68, 1, 22, 152469) But we can do no good either to ourselves or to India in this way.
('98', 68, 1, 23, 152536) Has anyone ever done any good to himself by theft or plunder or arson?
('98', 68, 1, 24, 152607) If this sort of thing goes on here, it must happen in Pakistan, too, and it will become impossible for anyone except Muslims to live in that country.
('98', 68, 1, 25, 152757) I receive communications every day warning me against being taken in by sweet talk and telling me that no one except Muslims has any place in Pakistan.
('98', 68, 1, 26, 152909) But if only Muslims are left in Pakistan in the end, they will then quarrel among themselves.
('98', 68, 1, 27, 153003) Whether this sort of thing goes on in Pakistan or India, it is not good.
('98', 68, 1, 28, 153076) It is worse in fact if it happens in India, for we never said that India belonged to Hindus alone or that only one community could live here.
('98', 68, 1, 29, 153218) Everyone who is born in India and who considers himself an Indian has a right to stay in India.
('98', 68, 1, 30, 153314) Pakistan however was conceived as a homeland of Muslims.
('98', 68, 1, 31, 153371) But when Pakistan became a reality on August 14 they said everyone would be able to live in Pakistan.
('98', 68, 1, 32, 153473) This made me happy.
('98', 68, 1, 33, 153493) What irks me is that what is said is often not implemented.
('98', 68, 1, 34, 153553) And if the Hindus and
('98', 69, 0, 1, 153575) 70 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 69, 1, 2, 153616) Sikhs here do the same I see in it only the ruin of the two communities and of the world.
('98', 69, 1, 3, 153706) No good can ever come of it.
('98', 69, 1, 4, 153735) A friend from Lahore says he had to leave his house and property against his wishes.
('98', 69, 1, 5, 153820) He was forced to flee West Punjab and come here.
('98', 69, 1, 6, 153869) When I advised the refugees to go back he went back.
('98', 69, 1, 7, 153922) He found that his house and land were no longer his.
('98', 69, 1, 8, 153975) He was given long lectures but he was not given back his property.
('98', 69, 1, 9, 154042) How then could I say that the refugees should go back?
('98', 69, 1, 10, 154097) I have dealt with this question before but since he has raised it I shall say something again.
('98', 69, 1, 11, 154192) I have very clearly said that the refugees should go back only when the circumstances have become more propitious.
('98', 69, 1, 12, 154307) Those who would like to return, should keep themselves in readiness.
('98', 69, 1, 13, 154376) First the Muslim friends who have taken the initiative in this respect have to go there.
('98', 69, 1, 14, 154465) So far it is only an idea but it cannot remain only an idea indefinitely.
('98', 69, 1, 15, 154539) They spoke in the name of the Pakistan Government.
('98', 69, 1, 16, 154590) Or they will have to admit in the end that they have failed and that they were wrong in representing the Pakistan Government as desiring the Hindus to go back.
('98', 69, 1, 17, 154750) The correspondent says that declarations are one thing and practice quite another and he wants to know whether he should go back.
('98', 69, 1, 18, 154880) He has every right to ask.
('98', 69, 1, 19, 154907) I must clearly say that at the moment there is no question of anyone going back.
('98', 69, 1, 20, 154988) There are many people wanting to go back.
('98', 69, 1, 21, 155030) I tell them that when the time comes for them to go back I shall let them know the date.
('98', 69, 1, 22, 155119) I shall not ask anyone to go now.
('98', 69, 1, 23, 155153) No one can really think of this at such an early stage, but it is very satisfying when these Muslim friends give this assurance.
('98', 69, 1, 24, 155282) If they succeed I am sure that the present poison in the atmosphere will soon disappear.
('98', 69, 1, 25, 155371) What needs to be done is to ensure that it will.
('98', 69, 1, 26, 155420) For the present, however, the correspondent and others like him should keep calm.
('98', 69, 1, 27, 155502) When the time comes I shall let them know.
('98', 69, 1, 28, 155545) After all no one wants to go to Pakistan secretly.
('98', 69, 1, 29, 155596) What I hope is that the Pakistan Government will arrange for a train which can take 5,000 people.
('98', 69, 1, 30, 155694) They will go willingly and as a matter of right.
('98', 69, 1, 31, 155743) They will go because they will have been invited.
('98', 69, 1, 32, 155793) There is yet another matter I must speak about and that is East Africa.
('98', 69, 1, 33, 155865) You may perhaps not know that Nairobi is the most salubrious part of East Africa.
('98', 69, 1, 34, 155947) It is like Simla in India.
('98', 69, 1, 35, 155974) We in India have four or five months that are quite good and then we have months of severe heat, especially severe in the plains.
('98', 69, 1, 36, 156104) People then want cool air and go to Simla or Darjeeling for it.
('98', 69, 1, 37, 156168) India is a big country.
('98', 69, 1, 38, 156192) Not so East

('98', 70, 1, 3, 156258) It was the Sikhs who built Nairobi.
('98', 70, 1, 4, 156294) Sikhs are very sturdy and industrious people.
('98', 70, 1, 5, 156340) With great labour they built a railway in Nairobi.
('98', 70, 1, 6, 156391) And yet they are debarred from Nairobi.
('98', 70, 1, 7, 156431) They may go there as labourers but not as settlers and traders.
('98', 70, 1, 8, 156495) So much about Nairobi.
('98', 70, 1, 9, 156518) But the thing does not stop there.
('98', 70, 1, 10, 156553) Once the first step is wrong, you go wrong all the way.
('98', 70, 1, 11, 156609) So now they propose to enact a Bill against Indian immigration into East Africa, very much on the lines of South Africa.
('98', 70, 1, 12, 156730) Attempts are being made to take away such rights as the Indians have so far enjoyed.
('98', 70, 1, 13, 156815) The Bill has not yet been passed but it has been introduced in the Legislative Assembly.
('98', 70, 1, 14, 156904) The Indians there have hopes from us.
('98', 70, 1, 15, 156942) They have sent a communication to Pandit Nehru, who is also our Foreign Minister in addition to being our Prime Minister.
('98', 70, 1, 16, 157064) They have sent him a telegram and forwarded a copy to me.
('98', 70, 1, 17, 157122) They want me to say something on the matter.
('98', 70, 1, 18, 157167) Since I have been in Africa they have a claim on me.
('98', 70, 1, 19, 157220) I therefore take this opportunity to raise my voice.
('98', 70, 1, 20, 157273) It will no doubt reach there.
('98', 70, 1, 21, 157303) India is now a free country.
('98', 70, 1, 22, 157332) Will free India be treated thus?
('98', 70, 1, 23, 157365) Mombasa and East Africa are British territories.
('98', 70, 1, 24, 157414) Will the Indians be subjected to maltreatment in a British territory?
('98', 70, 1, 25, 157484) You must know that there are a large number of Indian traders there— many of them Khoja and other Muslims.
('98', 70, 1, 26, 157591) There are also many Hindus.
('98', 70, 1, 27, 157619) They are from all parts of India.
('98', 70, 1, 28, 157653) They have also earned a lot of money through their trade with the Negroes there.
('98', 70, 1, 29, 157734) They have been there since long before the British entered the area.
('98', 70, 1, 30, 157803) Even Europeans had not made their entry there and if they had they were not many in number.
('98', 70, 1, 31, 157895) Indians have built large mansions there.
('98', 70, 1, 32, 157936) Even ships then belonged to us.
('98', 70, 1, 33, 157968) Later, when our position deteriorated, we lost the ships too.
('98', 70, 1, 34, 158030) Afterwards the British and other Europeans followed.
('98', 70, 1, 35, 158083) It is a long story into which I need not go.
('98', 70, 1, 36, 158128) Indians lived in peace with the Negroes and did business with them.
('98', 70, 1, 37, 158196) I shall not say they were always honest but certainly they did not take anything from anyone forcibly.
('98', 70, 1, 38, 158299) There are no communal differences between Hindus and Muslims there.
('98', 70, 1, 39, 158367) They are living in amity and harmony.
('98', 70, 1, 40, 158405) They want this anti Indian Bill to be withdrawn.
('98', 70, 1, 41, 158454) It must be withdrawn.
('98', 70, 1, 42, 158476) India is a free country and I am sure Jawaharlal will do what needs to be done in this regard.

('98', 71, 2, 3, 158710) December 18, 1947
('98', 71, 3, 4, 158728) I do feel angry but only with myself.
('98', 71, 3, 5, 158766) Why should I be angry with you?
('98', 71, 3, 6, 158798) Even if a woman like you hesitates to accept her mistakes, I do not see that you are at fault; the fault really is mine.
('98', 71, 3, 7, 158919) For you have been brought up under my care.
('98', 71, 3, 8, 158963) The atmosphere there 1 perhaps was not pure and so you did not inculcate all the virtues that make for sound character.
('98', 71, 3, 9, 159083) And it was my responsibility to see that the atmosphere there was pure.
('98', 71, 3, 10, 159155) I did not see to it.
('98', 71, 3, 11, 159176) Hence I cannot disown my responsibility.
('98', 71, 3, 12, 159217) In the same way I assumed that the Satyagraha struggles were conducted solely on the basis of truth and non violence.
('98', 71, 3, 13, 159335) Today God has made me realize that that was not so.
('98', 71, 3, 14, 159387) Hence I say that we make frantic efforts just to keep ourselves alive and therefore we cannot see our mistakes.
('98', 71, 3, 15, 159499) Our ahimsa is not ahimsa.
('98', 71, 3, 16, 159525) It has been used as a weapon of the weak.
('98', 71, 3, 17, 159567) It is himsa that passes by the name of ahimsa.
('98', 71, 3, 18, 159614) That is why today rivers of blood are flowing everywhere.
('98', 71, 3, 19, 159672) What the consequences may be is anybody’s guess.
('98', 71, 3, 20, 159721) But seeing all this, people like you should take pity on an old man like me and pray to God to take me away.
('98', 71, 3, 21, 159830) I know that today I irritate everyone.
('98', 71, 3, 22, 159869) How can I believe that I alone am right and all others are wrong?
('98', 71, 3, 23, 159935) What irks me is that people deceive me.
('98', 71, 3, 24, 159975) They should tell me frankly that I have become old, that I am no longer of any use and that I should not be in their way.
('98', 71, 3, 25, 160097) If they thus openly repudiate me I shall not be pained in the least.
('98', 71, 3, 26, 160166) And I shall also then cultivate the indomitable strength needed to serve Daridranarayana 2. I have only unburdened my heart to you.
('98', 71, 3, 27, 160298) If possible let other girls read this.
('98', 71, 3, 28, 160337) Your health will be all right.
('98', 71, 3, 29, 160368) 3’s going to America is in the offing.
('98', 71, 3, 30, 160407) I am not very keen about it.
('98', 71, 3, 31, 160436) So I do not have full information as to what is being done in that regard.

('98', 72, 2, 3, 160696) December 18, 1947
('98', 72, 3, 4, 160714) You of course come to see me every day.
('98', 72, 3, 5, 160754) For a long time now I have been feeling that nationalist Muslims are perhaps a prey to fear.
('98', 72, 3, 6, 160847) They come to me every day and talk a good deal but the impression I get is that they exaggerate somewhat.
('98', 72, 3, 7, 160953) If we indulge in exaggeration it will do no good to anyone— be he Hindu or Muslim.
('98', 72, 3, 8, 161036) If we think that we alone are right and suppress others in the belief that we are great and that therefore there is no harm in coercing others, we shall fall; we shall be deceiving ourselves.
('98', 72, 3, 9, 161228) But if we are truthful we shall show fearlessness, discretion and earnestness in our conduct.
('98', 72, 3, 10, 161322) If we are in error we should duly admit it.
('98', 72, 3, 11, 161366) We shall not fall thereby, we shall only rise higher.

('98', 72, 6, 15, 161500) NEW DELHI, December 18, 1947
('98', 72, 7, 16, 161529) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, A correspondent writes to ask why I object to English being used, but not to Urdu.
('98', 72, 7, 17, 161634) The Muslims and the English are the same to us since we are friends of all.
('98', 72, 7, 18, 161710) The correspondent’s complaint arises out of ignorance.
('98', 72, 7, 19, 161765) Not only do I not object to Urdu being used, I am its advocate.
('98', 72, 7, 20, 161829) It is a provincial language like Punjabi, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali and Oriya.
('98', 72, 7, 21, 161909) There are as many languages as there are provinces in India.
('98', 72, 7, 22, 161970) To be sure there are many more languages in India but scholars have selected 14 or 15 which have well developed literatures and which are more developed than the rest.
('98', 72, 7, 23, 162138) But all these 14 or 15 languages cannot be used in all the provinces.
('98', 72, 7, 24, 162208) The question also is what language should serve as a link language between the provinces.
('98', 72, 7, 25, 162298) Ever since I returned from South Africa I have been insisting that only a language which the largest number of Hindus and Muslims speak can be our national language.
('98', 72, 7, 26, 162464) This can only be Hindustani written in the Devanagari or the Persian script.
('98', 72, 7, 27, 162541) English has no place in India.
('98', 72, 7, 28, 162572) The British ruled over India and so English became important.
('98', 72, 7, 29, 162634) It is a foreign language, not an Indian language.
('98', 72, 7, 30, 162684) Therefore
('98', 73, 0, 1, 162694) 74 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 73, 1, 2, 162735) I say, not reluctantly but proudly, that Urdu is an Indian language formed in India.
('98', 73, 1, 3, 162820) We are all devotees of Tulsidas.
('98', 73, 1, 4, 162853) You will be surprised to know that he has used any number of words of Arabic or Persian origin in his Ramayana.
('98', 73, 1, 5, 162965) He just picked up words spoken in the streets and used them because Tulsidas was writing for you and me.
('98', 73, 1, 6, 163070) He was not writing for the few speaking Sanskrit.
('98', 73, 1, 7, 163120) The language of Tulsidas therefore is our language.
('98', 73, 1, 8, 163172) Lala Lajpatrai 1 was known as the Lion of the Punjab.
('98', 73, 1, 9, 163226) He is now no more.
('98', 73, 1, 10, 163245) He was a friend of mine and occasionally I jokingly used to ask him when he would learn to speak in Hindi.
('98', 73, 1, 11, 163352) He said that would never be.
('98', 73, 1, 12, 163381) You must know that he was an Arya Samajist 2 and performed havan and other rituals.
('98', 73, 1, 13, 163465) As I used to stay with him I observed all this.
('98', 73, 1, 14, 163513) In these rituals Sanskrit alone is used and he was able to pick a few words here and there in Devanagari.
('98', 73, 1, 15, 163619) But his mother tongue was Urdu.
('98', 73, 1, 16, 163651) He was a great Urdu scholar, could write fluently in Urdu and could also deliver long orations in that language.
('98', 73, 1, 17, 163764) He could also deliver long orations in English but he could never understand Sanskritized Hindi.
('98', 73, 1, 18, 163861) I could make myself understood by him only when I used selected Arabic and Persian words.
('98', 73, 1, 19, 163951) How then can the correspondent object to my not objecting to Urdu?
('98', 73, 1, 20, 164018) I think no one should object to Urdu.
('98', 73, 1, 21, 164056) English I certainly object to.
('98', 73, 1, 22, 164087) I have been twice President of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan 3 and I said the same thing there and no one opposed it.
('98', 73, 1, 23, 164202) They in fact applauded me.
('98', 73, 1, 24, 164229) I am the same man.
('98', 73, 1, 25, 164248) How then can anyone suggest that I love Hindi less and am therefore less of an Indian?
('98', 73, 1, 26, 164335) In my view he who objects to Urdu is to that extent less of an Indian.
('98', 73, 1, 27, 164406) Today we find ourselves in a mess and have created poison for ourselves.
('98', 73, 1, 28, 164479) This is what happened in Ajmer.
('98', 73, 1, 29, 164511) If you want to safeguard Hinduism you cannot do so by treating as enemies the Muslims who have stayed on in India.
('98', 73, 1, 30, 164626) My days in this world are numbered.
('98', 73, 1, 31, 164662) Soon I shall be gone.
('98', 73, 1, 32, 164684) You will then realize that what I said was right.
('98', 73, 1, 33, 164734) The same rule applies to Muslims.
('98', 73, 1, 34, 164768) Islam will be dead if Muslims can tolerate only Muslims.
('98', 73, 1, 35, 164825) The same goes for Christians and Christianity.
('98', 73, 2, 36, 164872) 1 (1865 1928); nationalist leader from the Punjab, educationist and journalist; organized a massive agrarian movement in the Punjab in 1907, and was deported to Burma; President of the Indian National Congress, 1920; died of injuries sustained during demonstration against Simon Commission 2 A member of the Arya Samaj, a reformist sect of Hinduism, founded by Dayanand Saraswati 3 In Mareh 1918 and April 1935
('98', 74, 0, 1, 165283) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 75
('98', 74, 1, 2, 165329) All the religions of the world are good, for they teach righteousness and friendship.
('98', 74, 1, 3, 165415) Those that teach enmity between men, I do not consider religions.
('98', 74, 1, 4, 165481) Even during the British rule I had said that English could not be the language of India.
('98', 74, 1, 5, 165570) I love the English language.
('98', 74, 1, 6, 165599) I can read and write it.
('98', 74, 1, 7, 165624) Everyone knows that I am not an enemy either of the English or their language.
('98', 74, 1, 8, 165703) But everything has its place.
('98', 74, 1, 9, 165733) English is an international language.
('98', 74, 1, 10, 165771) If we want to deal with the world outside India, we can do so only through English.
('98', 74, 1, 11, 165855) English is a universal language.
('98', 74, 1, 12, 165888) Hindustani has not yet acquired that universality.
('98', 74, 1, 13, 165939) It is a matter of sorrow that while we have freed ourselves of English rule, we have not been able to free ourselves of the impact of English culture and the English language.
('98', 74, 1, 14, 166115) Hindustani is the language that has been formed through the blending of Hindi and Urdu like the confluence of the two rivers Ganga and Jamuna at Prayag.
('98', 74, 1, 15, 166268) They share the same grammar which is the grammar of Hindustani.
('98', 74, 1, 16, 166332) It has words from Sanskrit, Persian, English and various other languages.
('98', 74, 1, 17, 166406) The word ‘court’ is as much a foreign word as ‘kachehari’ and there is no reason to reject the first and keep the latter.
('98', 74, 1, 18, 166528) Similarly there are words like ‘bicycle’ and ‘rail’.
('98', 74, 1, 19, 166581) By what name would you like to call a rail?
('98', 74, 1, 20, 166625) The fact is that so many English words have got into our speech and we do not despise them.
('98', 74, 1, 21, 166717) But if the correspondent had written to me in English, I would have thrown away the letter knowing that he did know Hindustani.
('98', 74, 1, 22, 166845) Similarly if I were to send him any letter written in English he would have the right to throw it away.
('98', 74, 1, 23, 166949) The matter is really quite simple but we have forgotten what is right and what is wrong.
('98', 74, 1, 24, 167038) And a kind of perversity has come to lodge in us.
('98', 74, 1, 25, 167088) May God protect us.

('98', 76, 1, 10, 168916) How were you attacked, who were the assailants?
('98', 76, 1, 11, 168964) This is being brought to you by Om Prakash.
('98', 76, 1, 12, 169008) Tell him everything if you cannot yourself write.
('98', 76, 1, 13, 169058) Send him back soon.
('98', 76, 1, 14, 169078) Your brother is ready to come.
('98', 76, 1, 15, 169109) Would you like him to come?
('98', 76, 1, 16, 169137) Whatever you say will be done.

('98', 76, 5, 22, 169313) NEW DELHI, December 19, 1947
('98', 76, 6, 23, 169342) CHIMANLAL,
('98', 76, 7, 24, 169353) I have had a full discussion with Aryanayakum.
('98', 76, 7, 25, 169400) I suggested to him that although you were the lawful manager he should regard himself as the de facto manager and act accordingly.
('98', 76, 7, 26, 169531) It means no one should lay claim to that part of the Ashram which he requires for the Talimi Sangh.
('98', 76, 7, 27, 169631) If he asks all the inmates of the Ashram to leave, no one should stay on.
('98', 76, 7, 28, 169705) He does believe that there is no difference between the inmates of the Ashram and the members of the Talimi Sangh or between the Ashram and the Talimi Sangh.
('98', 76, 7, 29, 169863) He cannot do any good to the Talimi Sangh at the cost of that of the Ashram.
('98', 76, 7, 30, 169940) I accept this fact in whatever I do, so should all of us.
('98', 76, 7, 31, 169998) Moreover, he says that neither Jaju nor Krishnadas has the slightest misunderstanding about or mistrust of him, which they earlier had.
('98', 76, 7, 32, 170134) I asked him to convey all this to you.
('98', 76, 7, 33, 170173) I also asked him to write you a letter to this effect.
('98', 76, 7, 34, 170228) He said that there was no need for a letter.
('98', 76, 7, 35, 170273) Tell me if you wish to have any change in this.
('98', 76, 7, 36, 170321) Tell me also if there has been any change.
('98', 76, 8, 37, 170364) 1 When the addressee and her mother failed to arrive at Delhi as scheduled on the 17th, Gandhiji had jocularly remarked: “Someone might have thrown Chand out mistaking her to be a Punjabi.”

('98', 77, 1, 2, 170595) You are likely to have seen something about Chand in the newspapers.

('98', 77, 6, 12, 170897) Talk with Hunar if you wish.
('98', 77, 6, 13, 170926) Hand over my letter 1 to him.
('98', 77, 6, 14, 170956) I have your letter.
('98', 77, 6, 15, 170976) There are many articles of yours but I have not understood which of them you want back.
('98', 77, 6, 16, 171064) I shall enquire from Pyarelal.
('98', 77, 6, 17, 171095) You must have read the report about Chand in the newspapers.
('98', 77, 6, 18, 171156) Everything is being done from this end.
('98', 77, 6, 19, 171196) There is a wire from Nawab Saheb saying that there is no cause for worry.

('98', 77, 9, 29, 171558) Pandit Sundarlal is here.
('98', 77, 9, 30, 171584) He has not told me anything.
('98', 77, 9, 31, 171613) I should at least have the opportunity to give a hearing.
('98', 77, 9, 32, 171671) I do hope that there is only some misunderstanding somewhere about Dev.
('98', 77, 9, 33, 171743) I have always held that Dev cannot be tainted by Kaliyug 2. I am sending on your letter to him.
('98', 77, 9, 34, 171839) You should have a free and frank talk with him.

('98', 78, 3, 4, 172169) I am here but my heart is in Bihar.
('98', 78, 3, 5, 172205) The peace that has been brought to Bihar should not suffer the slightest breach.
('98', 78, 3, 6, 172286) Even if the whole of India should burn, Bihar must not lose its peace.
('98', 78, 3, 7, 172357) If Bihar can do this, then just as the history of India’s freedom movement began with the Champaran Satyagraha 1 and came to be written in letters of gold, similarly Bihar will occupy the place of glory in India’s history for aeons to come.
('98', 78, 3, 8, 172598) Of this I have not the slightest doubt.

('98', 78, 5, 10, 172654) Dilhiman Gandhiji—II, p.
('98', 78, 6, 11, 172679) 64. ADDRESS TO MEOS
('98', 78, 7, 12, 172699) JESARAH, December 19. 1947
('98', 78, 8, 13, 172726) Addressing a gathering mainly of the Meos Gandhiji remarked that his voice was not so powerful as it once used to be.
('98', 78, 8, 14, 172844) There was a time when whatever he said was acted upon.
('98', 78, 8, 15, 172899) If it had the original power, not a single Muslim should have found it necessary to migrate to Pakistan from the Indian Union or a single Hindu or Sikh to leave his hearth and home in Pakistan and seek asylum in the Indian Union.
('98', 78, 8, 16, 173129) What had taken place—the orgy of murder, arson, loot, abductions, forcible conversions and worse that they had witnessed—was, in his opinion, unmitigated barbarism.
('98', 78, 8, 17, 173294) True, such things were not unknown before, but there was not that wholesale communal discrimination.
('98', 78, 8, 18, 173395) Tales of such happenings had filled him with grief and shame.
('98', 78, 8, 19, 173457) Even more shameful was the demolition and desecration of mosques, temples and gurdwaras.
('98', 78, 8, 20, 173546) Such madness, if it was not arrested, must spell ruin to both the communities.
('98', 78, 8, 21, 173625) They were far from freedom while this madness reigned.
('98', 78, 9, 22, 173680) What was the remedy, Gandhiji continued.
('98', 78, 9, 23, 173721) He had no faith in the force of bayonets.
('98', 78, 9, 24, 173763) He could only present to them the weapon of non violence, which provided an answer to every emergency and which was invulnerable.
('98', 78, 9, 25, 173893) It was common to all great religions—to Christianity no less than to Hinduism, etc., but it had today been reduced to a mere copy book maxim by the votaries of religions and in practice they all followed the law of the jungle.
('98', 78, 9, 26, 174120) His might be today a voice in the wilderness,
('98', 78, 10, 27, 174166) 1 Launched in 1917 against the Tinkathia system, under which peasants had to grow indigo on 3/20 of their holdings at the will of the landlords.
('98', 79, 0, 1, 174311) 80 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 79, 1, 2, 174352) said Gandhiji, but he had no other message to give them except this message of non violence of meeting the challenge of brute force with the power of the spirit.
('98', 79, 2, 3, 174514) Gandhiji then referred to the representation which was read to him by a representative of the Meos in which had been catalogued their complaints for which they wanted redress.
('98', 79, 2, 4, 174690) He had placed that letter, Gandhiji told the audience, in the hands of Dr. Gopichand, their Chief Minister and the speaker would leave it to him (Dr. Gopichand) to tell them what he proposed to do in regard to the various points set forth in it.
('98', 79, 2, 5, 174936) All he could say was that if any Government officer had been guilty of misconduct, he was sure, the Government would not hesitate to take suitable action against him.
('98', 79, 2, 6, 175103) No individual could be allowed to usurp the function of the Government and expect a reshuffle of Government officers at his bidding.
('98', 79, 2, 7, 175236) He was clear too that no conversion or marriage of a woman to a member of the opposite community could be recognized as valid on the plea of consent or free will.
('98', 79, 2, 8, 175399) It was abuse of words to talk of free consent when terror reigned.
('98', 79, 3, 9, 175466) He would feel happy, continued Gandhiji, if his words could bring some consolation to them in their distress.
('98', 79, 3, 10, 175576) Referring to the Meo refugees who had been driven out of the Alwar and Bharatpur States, Gandhiji remarked that he looked forward to the day when all enmities would be forgotten and all hatred buried underground and all those who had been driven away from their hearths and homes would return to them and resume their avocations in perfect security and peace as before.
('98', 79, 3, 11, 175946) His heart would then dance with joy.
('98', 79, 3, 12, 175983) He would never give up that hope so long as he lived.
('98', 79, 3, 13, 176037) But he was free to confess that today conditions were not ripe for it.
('98', 79, 3, 14, 176108) He was sure that the Union Government would not be remiss in discharging its duty in that respect, and the States would have to listen to the advice of the Union Government.
('98', 79, 3, 15, 176282) The Instrument of Accession did not give to the Rulers of the States the freedom to oppress their subjects.
('98', 79, 3, 16, 176390) The Rulers had to be trustees and servants of their subjects if they wanted to retain their status.
('98', 79, 3, 17, 176490) Gandhiji concluded by giving a word of advice to the Meos.
('98', 79, 3, 18, 176549) He had been told, he remarked, that the Meos were almost like criminal tribes.
('98', 79, 3, 19, 176628) If the statement was correct, it called for an all out effort on their part to reform themselves.
('98', 79, 3, 20, 176726) It should not be left to others to do the work of reclamation.
('98', 79, 3, 21, 176789) He hoped that the Meos would not resent his advice, but take it in the spirit in which it was offered.
('98', 79, 3, 22, 176892) To the Government he would say that even if the allegation regarding the Meos was correct, that was no argument for sending them away to Pakistan.
('98', 79, 3, 23, 177039) The Meos were subjects of the Indian Union and it was its duty to help them to reclaim themselves by providing them with facilities of education and establishing settlements for them to settle in.

('98', 79, 5, 26, 177354) On his way back to Delhi, Gandhiji visited an open air camp of the Meos and talked with the people there.

('98', 80, 2, 3, 177535) NEW DELHI, December 19, 1947
('98', 80, 3, 4, 177564) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, Today I had to go to Gurgaon to see the Meos.
('98', 80, 3, 5, 177632) The Meos there consist of refugees from Alwar and Bharatpur, besides those who are natives of the place.
('98', 80, 3, 6, 177737) The East Punjab Premier Dr. Gopichand Bhargava accompanied me.
('98', 80, 3, 7, 177800) He told the Meos that those of them who wanted to stay could stay on.
('98', 80, 3, 8, 177870) The Government would protect them.
('98', 80, 3, 9, 177905) That hundreds of thousands had to leave their houses and properties in Pakistan was something barbarous.
('98', 80, 3, 10, 178010) It was also a barbarous thing that people had to leave their houses and properties here.
('98', 80, 3, 11, 178099) One cannot go into who committed more barbarities because such a discussion cannot end the enmity that has been generated.
('98', 80, 3, 12, 178222) It should not be our fate to be eternal enemies of each other.
('98', 80, 3, 13, 178285) It will only end in our ruin.
('98', 80, 3, 14, 178315) I have said that I cannot tolerate this.
('98', 80, 3, 15, 178356) Those who have made up their minds to go will certainly go but no one will be forced to go.
('98', 80, 3, 16, 178448) There are men and women there in large numbers.
('98', 80, 3, 17, 178496) All of them are in distress.
('98', 80, 3, 18, 178525) Many of them have not even tents to shelter them and the days are so cold.
('98', 80, 3, 19, 178600) It is a tragic sight.
('98', 80, 3, 20, 178622) The Alwar State should admit its mistake and invite them back.
('98', 80, 3, 21, 178685) The Bharatpur State should do the same.
('98', 80, 3, 22, 178725) One cannot say that Meos are a criminal tribe.
('98', 80, 3, 23, 178772) Who can say who is criminal and who is not?
('98', 80, 3, 24, 178816) And will you exile those who are criminals?
('98', 80, 3, 25, 178860) Will you kill them?
('98', 80, 3, 26, 178880) This will never do.
('98', 80, 3, 27, 178900) You have to reform them and educate them and show them the ways of civilized behaviour.
('98', 80, 3, 28, 178988) My second topic today is sugar.
('98', 80, 3, 29, 179020) Sugar is not produced everywhere.
('98', 80, 3, 30, 179054) It has to be transported from the places where it is produced.
('98', 80, 3, 31, 179117) If we do not have sugar here we have to bring it from the U. P. or Coimbatore, but how to do it?
('98', 80, 3, 32, 179214) It can only be brought in railway wagons, but there are no wagons available.
('98', 80, 3, 33, 179291) Dr. John Matthai who is in charge of the Railways is helpless.
('98', 80, 3, 34, 179354) He says all the wagons are already in use and are being fully utilized.
('98', 80, 3, 35, 179426) Then there is a shortage of coal and iron and of staff.
('98', 80, 3, 36, 179482) Also the producers of sugar keep on raising prices and after all it cannot be carried on one’s head.
('98', 80, 3, 37, 179583) But though there is a shortage of railway wagons there is motor transport.
('98', 80, 3, 38, 179658) A motor truck runs as fast as a train and it does not require steel rails
('98', 81, 0, 1, 179732) 82 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 81, 1, 2, 179773) on which to ply.
('98', 81, 1, 3, 179790) But motor transport requires petrol and petrol is still a controlled article.
('98', 81, 1, 4, 179868) If the control over petrol is lifted the trucks and lorries will start plying more easily and haul goods from one place to another.
('98', 81, 1, 5, 180000) The movement of salt can also become more smooth.
('98', 81, 1, 6, 180050) It is paradoxical that we produce so much salt and there is no tax on it any more, and yet it is so costly.
('98', 81, 1, 7, 180158) That is because supplies do not arrive.
('98', 81, 1, 8, 180198) In my view it has been a mistake to appoint contractors for producing and supplying salt.
('98', 81, 1, 9, 180288) If petrol is decontrolled trucks can be used for carrying salt and several other things.
('98', 81, 1, 10, 180377) It does not seem right to decontrol certain articles and continue control over others.
('98', 81, 1, 11, 180464) When we have adopted decontrol as a policy we must pursue it fully and see what happens.
('98', 81, 1, 12, 180553) You cannot say there is no petrol in the market.
('98', 81, 1, 13, 180602) Black market is flourishing in petrol and it will continue to flourish so long as the control over it is not lifted.
('98', 81, 1, 14, 180719) I am told that corruption has also increased, that it is necessary to grease the palm of the petroleum officer and it is not a question of a rupee or two but of hundreds of rupees.
('98', 81, 1, 15, 180900) Petrol is required only by those who run motor transport.
('98', 81, 1, 16, 180958) The Government should retain what petrol it needs for itself and release the rest to be sold in the open market.
('98', 81, 1, 17, 181071) Of course even if petrol should become virtually extinct and trains should become immobilized, the country’s affairs will not stop.
('98', 81, 1, 18, 181203) Only the mode of transport will be changed.
('98', 81, 1, 19, 181247) We will revert to old ways.
('98', 81, 1, 20, 181275) I have therefore no fears from the control over petrol being lifted.
('98', 81, 1, 21, 181344) We do not produce enough foodgrain for ourselves.
('98', 81, 1, 22, 181394) We may tell people to cultivate whatever land they have but for this one is told that fertilizers are required for the import of which we have to spend crores of rupees.
('98', 81, 1, 23, 181564) The fertilizers cause erosion of the soil.
('98', 81, 1, 24, 181607) This is not what I say.
('98', 81, 1, 25, 181631) It is what those who know the subject say.
('98', 81, 1, 26, 181674) Mirabehn has been doing this work.
('98', 81, 1, 27, 181709) She convened a conference of experts.
('98', 81, 1, 28, 181747) 1 Some very important people were with her in this.
('98', 81, 1, 29, 181799) There was Rajendra Babu and Sir Datar Singh and various others who know something about the subject.
('98', 81, 1, 30, 181900) The conclusions of the Conference are in the newspapers.
('98', 81, 1, 31, 181957) It recommended ways to make compost and what is called organic manure.
('98', 81, 1, 32, 182028) We have dung in plenty; then there is also human faeces which can make very good manure.
('98', 81, 1, 33, 182117) After it is converted into compost nobody can say how it was made.
('98', 81, 1, 34, 182184) If you take it in hand it has a pleasant smell, not an unpleasant one.
('98', 81, 1, 35, 182255) In making compost they also mix grass, leaves and other farmyard waste with the dung and in time

('98', 82, 1, 3, 182508) The Conference also passed many resolutions but the substance was that we should all work hard at agriculture and grow four maunds where only one maund grew before.
('98', 82, 1, 4, 182673) Mirabehn has left today.
('98', 82, 1, 5, 182698) She lives in Rishikesh near Hardwar.
('98', 82, 1, 6, 182735) She intends to carry on this work there.
('98', 82, 1, 7, 182776) I thought I would tell you about this so that you can make what use you can of the information.

('98', 82, 5, 12, 182978) m., December 20, 1947
('98', 82, 6, 13, 183000) DEV, Yesterday I wrote a letter to you which will have reached you.
('98', 82, 6, 14, 183068) Don’t worry about Chand.
('98', 82, 6, 15, 183093) Her mother’s brother met me yesterday.
('98', 82, 6, 16, 183132) Pyarelal read “The Call of the Hour” yesterday.
('98', 82, 6, 17, 183180) I have read it by now.
('98', 82, 6, 18, 183203) The ideas are good.
('98', 82, 6, 19, 183223) The last portion requires more thought.
('98', 82, 6, 20, 183263) I have made no effort to revise it; that would require more time and from where can I have it?
('98', 82, 6, 21, 183358) It is not easy to form an association.
('98', 82, 6, 22, 183397) First, discuss the matter with a few people, then proceed further.
('98', 82, 6, 23, 183464) Anyway, it is for you to consider what the atmosphere prevailing there 1 demands.
('98', 82, 6, 24, 183546) Of course, you must consult Mahesh.
('98', 82, 6, 25, 183582) If he disapproves you may give up the idea.
('98', 82, 6, 26, 183626) There is no harm in printing it as an essay after it has been trimmed.
('98', 82, 6, 27, 183697) Enclosed with the letter to you yesterday were a letter from Hunar and also my letter to him.
('98', 82, 6, 28, 183791) I do not understand what you have written in your letter to Sushila.
('98', 82, 6, 29, 183860) I cannot imagine stopping any work that is being carried on in my name.
('98', 82, 6, 30, 183932) I have not given up either Noakhali or Calcutta or Bihar.
('98', 82, 6, 31, 183990) In any of these three places, as here, I have only to do or die.

('98', 83, 2, 3, 184214) December 20, 1947
('98', 83, 3, 4, 184232) I am now an old man; and maybe the country is experiencing, in your sense, the surge of freedom.
('98', 83, 3, 5, 184329) I do not see the joy of it on any face.
('98', 83, 3, 6, 184369) It may be that since I myself feel no joy my eyes cannot see any.
('98', 83, 3, 7, 184435) Does not a jaundiced person see only yellow?
('98', 83, 3, 8, 184480) If everybody practised his own dharma our condition would immediately improve.
('98', 83, 3, 9, 184559) Atman itself is atman’s friend and foe.
('98', 83, 4, 10, 184599) It is quite true that .
('98', 83, 4, 11, 184623) 2 has no use for non violence and truth.
('98', 83, 4, 12, 184664) But of what worth are non violence and truth today?
('98', 83, 4, 13, 184716) Truth is not a piece of stone.
('98', 83, 4, 14, 184747) It is a diamond more valuable than the Koh i noor and requires much more hard labour to mine.
('98', 83, 4, 15, 184841) 3 But those who are today engaged in demoniacal activity will find it difficult to understand the experiment in truth.

('98', 83, 8, 19, 185031) NEW DELHI, December 20, 1947
('98', 83, 9, 20, 185060) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, It is a matter of grief that there has been rioting again in Delhi.
('98', 83, 9, 21, 185150) It has been of a minor nature, but still it is regrettable.
('98', 83, 9, 22, 185210) If it is our wish that Muslims should leave India, we should say so clearly or the Government may declare that it will not be safe for Muslims to continue to live in India.
('98', 83, 9, 23, 185383) Or we should all tell them that rather than be killed off slowly in riots, it would be better for them to go.
('98', 83, 9, 24, 185493) But if we do so I see in it the doom of Hinduism and Sikhism.
('98', 83, 9, 25, 185555) Likewise it will be the doom of Islam if Pakistan decides that no Hindus and Sikhs may live there.
('98', 83, 9, 26, 185654) There are not very many Muslims left in India.
('98', 83, 9, 27, 185701) We have already expelled a large number.
('98', 83, 9, 28, 185742) They did not go voluntarily.
('98', 83, 9, 29, 185771) They were compelled to leave.
('98', 83, 9, 30, 185801) I wish we could become brave and noble and courageous.
('98', 83, 9, 31, 185856) It is only a coward who will say that a Muslim

('98', 84, 1, 2, 186007) may not stay in India.
('98', 84, 1, 3, 186030) Why can’t a Muslim stay in India?
('98', 84, 1, 4, 186064) If he is bad he must be reformed—not through violence but by persuasion.
('98', 84, 1, 5, 186137) Why have we come to this pass that Hindus and Sikhs should live in fear in Pakistan and Muslims should live in fear in India?
('98', 84, 1, 6, 186263) And yet we make the tall claims that everyone can live in our country in peace.
('98', 84, 1, 7, 186343) I tell the Government that they must see that our promises are fulfilled.
('98', 84, 1, 8, 186417) The army, the police and the officials have all to become good.
('98', 84, 1, 9, 186481) If we behave decently we can make progress.
('98', 84, 1, 10, 186525) If not, the reins of power that have come into our hands will slip away.
('98', 84, 1, 11, 186598) I have not yet told you all that happened at the meeting of the Charkha Sangh.
('98', 84, 1, 12, 186677) The charkha is the pivot of the village industries.
('98', 84, 1, 13, 186729) If the charkha does not ply in the seven lakh villages of India the other village industries cannot flourish.
('98', 84, 1, 14, 186839) The charkha is the sun while the other village industries are the planets revolving around it.
('98', 84, 1, 15, 186934) If the sun should become extinct the planets cannot go on, for they depend on the sun.
('98', 84, 1, 16, 187021) For India the sun is the wheel which you can see enshrined in the flag.
('98', 84, 1, 17, 187093) It does not matter whether you see it as the Sudarshan Chakra [of Krishna] or the Dharma Chakra of Ashoka.
('98', 84, 1, 18, 187200) In my eyes it is the symbol of the spinning wheel.
('98', 84, 1, 19, 187251) If that charkha goes on in the villages of India other village industries will also go on.
('98', 84, 1, 20, 187342) But we shall have to see that they go on, because if they decline the charkha also will decline.
('98', 84, 1, 21, 187439) There are many villages around Delhi.
('98', 84, 1, 22, 187477) The villages supplied so many things.
('98', 84, 1, 23, 187515) Today all those things are not procurable.
('98', 84, 1, 24, 187558) Perhaps you do not know, although you should, that Delhi was full of Muslim craftsmen.
('98', 84, 1, 25, 187645) They have all left.
('98', 84, 1, 26, 187665) Look at Panipat.
('98', 84, 1, 27, 187682) There were many Muslims there, weaving blankets and making such other things.
('98', 84, 1, 28, 187760) Today their trade is ruined.
('98', 84, 1, 29, 187789) If Muslim craftsmen leave India it is India’s loss.
('98', 84, 1, 30, 187841) What is the reason for our fighting in Kashmir?
('98', 84, 1, 31, 187889) I consider it barbarous for the tribal raiders to have attacked Kashmir; we had to send an army to fight them.
('98', 84, 1, 32, 188000) Yesterday I told you that Mirabehn had taken up the work of compost making and that the Government was helping her.
('98', 84, 1, 33, 188116) We can all carry on this work in our homes.
('98', 84, 1, 34, 188160) We can collect human waste, cow dung and vegetable waste—which mix beautifully and turn out to be an excellent manure—smelling good.
('98', 84, 1, 35, 188293) The work of the Village Industries and the Charkha Sangh can go on only if the masses take it up.
('98', 84, 1, 36, 188391) All the four organizations, namely, the Charkha Sangh, the Harijan Sevak Sangh, the Gramodyog Sangh and the Talimi Sangh had been formed for the masses, not for the
('98', 85, 0, 1, 188556) 86 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 85, 1, 2, 188597) Everyone should co operate in the work of these bodies.
('98', 85, 1, 3, 188653) If we want true democracy to be established in India, we must all co operate in furthering that work.
('98', 85, 1, 4, 188755) It is only the people who can make a success of any work.
('98', 85, 1, 5, 188813) The people provide the foundation on which alone we can raise a structure of any height.
('98', 85, 1, 6, 188902) But if we only continue our internecine strife we shall meet with the same fate as the Yadavas did.
('98', 85, 1, 7, 189002) Krishna, you will remember, belonged to the Yadava clan and yet because they strayed from the right path they took to drinking, debauchery and fighting among themselves.
('98', 85, 1, 8, 189172) The result was that they met with a sad end.
('98', 85, 1, 9, 189217) If we want that India should avoid that fate we should all take in hand the activities pursued by the four organizations I have mentioned.

('98', 85, 4, 13, 189429) 69. LAWS OF HEALTH
('98', 85, 5, 14, 189448) Shri Brijlal Nehru, himself a faddist like me, has written to the Press belauding the statement of the Minister of Health that “a very great deal of our ill health is due to our own fault” and saying that there is to his knowledge no governmental agency responsible for removing this fault.
('98', 85, 5, 15, 189739) He adds:
('98', 85, 6, 16, 189748) The attention of our Health Minister has so far been confined to the establishment of hospitals, sanatoria, clinics, dispensaries, etc., i.e., devices for the treatment of disease; no institutions have been founded for the prevention of disease by bringing home to the people the need of correct living and the methods of doing so.
('98', 85, 6, 17, 190080) He then goes on to suggest that a separate branch be established to attend to the promotion of health as distinguished from treatment of disease.
('98', 85, 6, 18, 190226) This agency may be given the assistance of an advisory body of both experts and laymen so that the experts may devise their schemes with the full knowledge of the requirements of the people and the limitations under which they have to live and work.
('98', 85, 6, 19, 190476) Why does this fellow faddist want a separate branch for this very necessary purpose?
('98', 85, 6, 20, 190561) This was the fashion under the old regime which went on piling expenditure on expenditure and deluded itself and the gullible public that the greater the expense the greater the utility.
('98', 85, 6, 21, 190748) I would have the Minister of Health require the doctors under her and the other staff understand that their first care must be the attainment
('98', 86, 0, 1, 190890) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 87
('98', 86, 1, 2, 190936) and preservation of the health of the public whom they are paid to serve.
('98', 86, 1, 3, 191010) As a preliminary step the writer
('98', 86, 2, 4, 191043) would have the production of a book on health laws and correct living in the conditions prevailing in India.
('98', 86, 2, 5, 191152) To carry weight with the public, the book must be brought out under the authority of the Health Ministry of the Government of India.
('98', 86, 2, 6, 191285) 1 The duty of writing such a book may be entrusted to the Indian Medical Association, who should be required to produce it within a stated time.
('98', 86, 2, 7, 191430) A transfer of emphasis from disease to health in the teaching given in our medical colleges would in itself be most desirable.
('98', 86, 2, 8, 191557) Indeed, the teaching of the laws of health should be obligatory in all schools and colleges.
('98', 86, 2, 9, 191650) If the treatise recommended by Shri Brijlal Nehru is brought out, I hope the authors would be instructed to avoid the introduction of disease under the guise of preserving health such as the craze for various inoculations.

('98', 86, 5, 13, 191943) An All India Compost Conference was held in New Delhi during the month to consider the question of compost development on the widest scale possible.
('98', 86, 5, 14, 192092) It was the conception of Shrimati Mirabehn and was presided over by Dr. Rajendra Prasad.
('98', 86, 5, 15, 192181) Sardar Datar Singh, Dr. Acharya and other eminent men in the line took part in it.
('98', 86, 5, 16, 192264) Several important resolutions were passed by it on schemes for towns and villages.
('98', 86, 5, 17, 192347) A subcommittee consisting of Shrimati Mirabehn, Shri Shivakumar Sharma, Dr. B. N. Lal and Dr. K. G. Joshi (with Dr. B. N. Lal as convener) was appointed to prepare a skeleton scheme for the provinces.
('98', 86, 5, 18, 192548) The resolutions emphasized the necessity of “the agricul tural utilization of town sewage, sullage and sludge, the utilization of the by products of the slaughter house and other trade wastes (for example, wool waste, mill waste, leather waste, etc.) and for the composting of other materials like waterhyacinth, cane trash, press mud, forest leaves, etc.” These resolutions are good and useful if they do not remain

('98', 87, 0, 1, 193066) 88 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 87, 1, 2, 193107) merely on paper.
('98', 87, 1, 3, 193124) The chief thing is whether they would be reduced to practice throughout India.
('98', 87, 1, 4, 193203) To do so will tax the resources of many Mirabehns.
('98', 87, 1, 5, 193254) Given the willing co operation of the masses of India, this country can not only drive out shortage of food, but can provide India with more than enough.
('98', 87, 1, 6, 193408) This organic manure ever enriches, never impoverishes the soil.
('98', 87, 1, 7, 193472) The daily waste, judiciously composted, returns to the soil in the form of golden manure causing a saving of millions of rupees and increasing manifold, the total yield of grains and pulses.
('98', 87, 1, 8, 193663) In addition, the judicious use of waste keeps the surroundings clean.
('98', 87, 1, 9, 193733) And cleanliness is not only next to godliness, it promotes health.

('98', 87, 3, 12, 193849) 71. COMPOST MANURE
('98', 87, 4, 13, 193868) Manure may be described as of two kinds: chemical and organic.
('98', 87, 4, 14, 193931) One might ask how manure could be organic?
('98', 87, 4, 15, 193974) The word “organic” is from English.
('98', 87, 4, 16, 194010) Organic manure is made from human and animal excreta mixed or not mixed with grass, leaves and other such things.
('98', 87, 4, 17, 194124) We do not regard plants as lifeless but we do regard iron, etc., to be so.
('98', 87, 4, 18, 194199) Manure formed from such mixture is called “compost” in English.
('98', 87, 4, 19, 194263) I consider such manure as valuable as gold.
('98', 87, 4, 20, 194307) It keeps the soil ever fertile.
('98', 87, 4, 21, 194339) It does not erode the soil and make it barren.
('98', 87, 4, 22, 194386) It is said that chemical fertilizers destroy the humus of the soil as also bacteria and makes it necessary to keep the soil fallow after every few years of cultivation.
('98', 87, 4, 23, 194555) Moreover organic manure prevents the breeding of pests.
('98', 87, 4, 24, 194611) Under Mirabehn’s inspiration and through her efforts a Conference was called in Delhi this month to popularize such manure among the people.
('98', 87, 4, 25, 194752) It was presided over by Dr. Rajendra Prasad.
('98', 87, 4, 26, 194797) It was attended by Sardar Datar Singh, Dr. Acharya and others who are experts in this field.
('98', 87, 4, 27, 194890) After three days of deliberation they passed several important resolutions.
('98', 87, 4, 28, 194966) In these resolutions they have pointed out what should be done in cities and in the seven lakh villages.
('98', 87, 4, 29, 195071) The Conference has suggested the method of mixing human and animal excreta, garbage, rags and factory waste, in rural and urban areas.
('98', 87, 4, 30, 195206) For this purpose a small sub committee has been formed.
('98', 87, 4, 31, 195262) The face of India will change if the resolutions do not remain on paper and crores of people put them into actual practice.
('98', 87, 4, 32, 195386) We will

('98', 88, 1, 2, 195440) be then able to save golden manure worth crores of rupees which is being wasted because of our ignorance.
('98', 88, 1, 3, 195546) The soil will become fertile and we will get better crops than what we are getting.
('98', 88, 1, 4, 195630) As a result we will be rid of famines, crores of people will get enough to eat and the surplus can be exported.
('98', 88, 1, 5, 195742) Today our crops are in the same poor condition as our men and animals.
('98', 88, 1, 6, 195813) The fault is not of the soil but of the people.
('98', 88, 1, 7, 195861) The worms of lethargy and ignorance are eating into us.
('98', 88, 1, 8, 195917) The task undertaken by Mirabehn is of immense magnitude.
('98', 88, 1, 9, 195974) It will require thousands of Mirabehns.
('98', 88, 1, 10, 196014) People should take up the work with zest and Government departments should be awake.
('98', 88, 1, 11, 196099) Merely a few volunteers will not be able to do the work which requires crores of men.
('98', 88, 1, 12, 196185) We should have an army of volunteers.
('98', 88, 1, 13, 196223) Is India so fortunate?
('98', 88, 1, 14, 196246) Here India means both the parts.
('98', 88, 1, 15, 196279) If the southern part takes up the work one may be sure the northern part will also take it up.

('98', 88, 7, 24, 196656) 1 I think they are both noble, circumspect, patriotic and industrious.
('98', 88, 7, 25, 196727) There is a letter from Jehangir informing me that they will be seeing me next week.

('98', 89, 2, 3, 197094) NEW DELHI, December 21, 1947
('98', 89, 3, 4, 197123) LILI, I have your postcard.
('98', 89, 3, 5, 197151) So you have found a place.
('98', 89, 3, 6, 197178) You deserve congratulation.
('98', 89, 3, 7, 197206) I deem it your good fortune that you have an opportunity to study under a man like Dr. Mangaldas Shah.
('98', 89, 3, 8, 197309) You should not be put out by his severity.
('98', 89, 3, 9, 197352) You should welcome it and benefit from it.
('98', 89, 3, 10, 197395) If someone wants to improve us and in so doing corrects us, takes us to task in the presence of others, we should be pleased rather than annoyed.
('98', 89, 3, 11, 197541) More so when the person happens to be our teacher.
('98', 89, 3, 12, 197592) If a doctor makes a mistake, the patient has to pay for it—at times with his life.
('98', 89, 3, 13, 197675) One should therefore look for a teacher who does not condone mistakes.
('98', 89, 3, 14, 197746) You must get rid of your tendency to worry.
('98', 89, 3, 15, 197790) That the pain in your feet should persist I don’t like.
('98', 89, 3, 16, 197846) You must go to a doctor and find a cure for it.
('98', 89, 3, 17, 197894) It will be a crime to be careless or lazy in this matter.
('98', 89, 3, 18, 197952) You must devote yourself to your studies without being impatient.
('98', 89, 3, 19, 198018) You must think of nothing else for the present.
('98', 89, 3, 20, 198066) Ponder and digest what you read.
('98', 89, 3, 21, 198099) The student who is given to cramming is considered a fool of the first water.
('98', 89, 3, 22, 198177) I am quite well.

('98', 89, 8, 29, 198325) 1 So long as saintliness is not of the heart, it is of no value to me.
('98', 89, 8, 30, 198396) If saintliness is hypocritical it will destroy itself.
('98', 89, 8, 31, 198451) I am not certain how long I shall have to be here.
('98', 89, 8, 32, 198502) I must do or die.
('98', 89, 8, 33, 198520) And since I am resolved to die I do pray to God that He may fulfil the wish.
('98', 89, 8, 34, 198597) All of you too should make the same prayer.
('98', 89, 8, 35, 198641) In Delhi, during day time, many incidents, small and big, keep occurring.
('98', 89, 8, 36, 198715) I have been and continue to be patient beyond measure.

('98', 90, 5, 8, 199033) A WORTHY EXAMPLE
('98', 90, 6, 9, 199050) Shri Dilkhush Divanji of Karadi fame reports the glorious death at his post of one of his staunch workers.
('98', 90, 6, 10, 199157) The late Valjibhai was the nephew of Panchakaka, the famous farmer of Karadi, who took part in the no tax campaign of Bardoli 1. He never wavered.
('98', 90, 6, 11, 199304) He refuses even now to till his land or to pay the tax.
('98', 90, 6, 12, 199360) He rightly says that there is no swaraj of his dream so long as we need the police to guard our homes and the military to protect us from ourselves.
('98', 90, 6, 13, 199509) The deceased left a lucrative job and purely from a patriotic motive became a weaver.
('98', 90, 6, 14, 199595) He proved worthy of his uncle and died in harness.
('98', 90, 6, 15, 199646) No man can wish for a nobler death than Valjibhai’s.
('98', 90, 6, 16, 199699) It is to be wished that the weavers who were trained by him would multiply themselves.
('98', 90, 6, 17, 199786) If India is to come to her own, she needs thousands of weavers who will weave nothing but hand spun yarn and expects every man and woman and child above six years to spin good yarn daily for at least half an hour.
('98', 90, 6, 18, 200000) Such is Divanji’s’ dream and Valjibhai died for its realization.
('98', 90, 7, 19, 200065) STOCK GRAIN IN VILLAGES
('98', 90, 8, 20, 200089) Shri Vaikunth Lallubhai Mehta writes to say that in view of general decontrol it is imperative that there should be sufficient grain stocked in the hands, if possible of the village panchayats, not for profiteering, but as an insurance against scarcity by whatever cause induced.
('98', 90, 8, 21, 200369) His original letter is in Gujarati which I have reproduced and dealt with in the Gujarati columns.
('98', 90, 8, 22, 200468) 2 Here has been given the pith of his argument.
('98', 90, 8, 23, 200516) I have always held that whatever may be said in favour of cash payment of taxes, its introduction injured the nation to the extent that the system of stocking grain in the villages was disturbed.
('98', 90, 8, 24, 200712) The conservation of’ grain in the villages is needed for the reason already mentioned.
('98', 90, 8, 25, 200799) The condition always must be that the growers and dealers

('98', 91, 0, 1, 200915) 92 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 91, 1, 2, 200956) must not be greedy or unscrupulous.
('98', 91, 1, 3, 200992) When this simple honesty becomes common, the consumer cannot be cheated.
('98', 91, 1, 4, 201065) There is no question of high or low prices when a nation’s economics are put on a sound basis and when all parties have an income commensurate with the expenditure required for the necessaries of life.
('98', 91, 2, 5, 201267) THE GATES OF SOMNATH?
('98', 91, 3, 6, 201289) Pandit Sundarlal has contributed to the Hindustani columns an interesting article 1 on the reputed gates of Somnath.
('98', 91, 3, 7, 201406) The curious must see the original.
('98', 91, 3, 8, 201441) The main point made by the writer is that the gates which were taken away to Ghazni were never brought back as then stated.
('98', 91, 3, 9, 201565) The gates were a fabrication and when the fraud was discovered the exhibition of the ‘gates’ never travelled beyond Agra.
('98', 91, 3, 10, 201687) Pandit Sundarlal is anxious that by an oversight the fabrication might not be used in the projected renovation of the famous temple.

('98', 91, 6, 14, 201908) Shri Vaikunthbhai writes:
('98', 91, 7, 15, 201934) Under the present trading system the grain produced in the villages is being sent out.
('98', 91, 7, 16, 202021) Therefore in many parts of the country the villages are left with no stocks of grain.
('98', 91, 7, 17, 202107) As a result the poor have to face hardships and there is a steep rise in prices during the monsoon.
('98', 91, 7, 18, 202207) To save the poor from such a plight, it is desirable that some grain should be stocked in villages under the care of the Panch, and only the surplus should be sent out.
('98', 91, 7, 19, 202376) With this end in view Shri Achyut Rao Patwardhan and I had prepared a scheme four years ago.
('98', 91, 7, 20, 202469) Shri Kumarappa has also acknowledged the need for such a scheme in his plan.
('98', 91, 8, 21, 202546) If the scheme meets with your approval, under the present changed circumstances you may kindly recommend it to the Provincial Governments and the villagers.
('98', 91, 8, 22, 202703) I think the suggestion has something in it.
('98', 91, 8, 23, 202747) Such stocks are necessary in the economic conditions of the country.
('98', 91, 8, 24, 202816) Ever since the system of collecting revenue in cash was introduced, the stocks of grain in the villages have diminished.
('98', 91, 8, 25, 202937) I shall not go into the merits or
('98', 91, 9, 26, 202971) 1 Which appeared in Harijan Sevak, 28 12 1947, under the title “Somnathka Mandir”

('98', 92, 1, 2, 203099) demerits of the cash revenue system; but I do believe the country could have been saved from the present difficult situation if we had continued to stock grain in the villages.
('98', 92, 1, 3, 203276) Now that the controls are being removed no one will suffer any hardship if the grain is stocked as suggested by Vaikunthbhai and if the villagers and the traders become honest.
('98', 92, 1, 4, 203453) If the farmers and the traders get a fair margin of profit there can be no high prices for the working class and other people in the cities.
('98', 92, 1, 5, 203594) What really matters is that necessaries of life should be within the reach of every one.
('98', 92, 1, 6, 203683) There can then be no question of high or low prices.

('98', 92, 6, 12, 203863) India, indeed the world, has had few dedicated servants like the late Valjibhai.
('98', 92, 6, 13, 203944) He has proved the truth of the saying: “As the tree so the fruit, as the father, so the son.” Panchakaka’s pledge will remain without parallel.
('98', 92, 6, 14, 204088) We have not attained true swaraj yet.
('98', 92, 6, 15, 204126) At present it seems quite far away.
('98', 92, 6, 16, 204162) Why is it that we have only six or seven weavers as good as Valjibhai?
('98', 92, 6, 17, 204233) Can it be claimed that we have won swaraj with the power of Karadi?

('98', 96, 6, 13, 209219) What you say is also worth considering.
('98', 96, 6, 14, 209259) 1 You should tell Panditji 2. But I see no harm in it.
('98', 96, 6, 15, 209314) Even as it is what is my word worth now?
('98', 96, 6, 16, 209355) And what is it to me whether my word has any worth left or not?
('98', 96, 6, 17, 209419) I am certainly going to say whatever I think is true.
('98', 96, 6, 18, 209473) I do not find any merit in the belief that a man can judge another man.
('98', 96, 6, 19, 209545) Only the Almighty can judge us.
('98', 96, 6, 20, 209577) All will be well with us if we are faithful to Him and fear Him.
('98', 96, 6, 21, 209642) Instead of bothering about what would please men we should concern ourselves with what would please God.
('98', 96, 6, 22, 209747) Only then will our path become easy.
('98', 96, 6, 23, 209784) Is it not enough if, instead of worrying about other people’s affairs, you and I can do this?
('98', 96, 6, 24, 209878) See, how badly you have caught a cold.
('98', 96, 6, 25, 209917) You had fever last night.
('98', 96, 6, 26, 209943) You must take hot water.
('98', 96, 6, 27, 209968) It does not matter if you cannot do anything else but if you learn to fulfil the duty towards the body you can do much work for me.
('98', 96, 6, 28, 210100) Your heart and mind are sound, but your hands and feet are weak.
('98', 96, 6, 29, 210165) See what pass India has come to because of lack of co operation and how I am shouting for harmony.
('98', 96, 6, 30, 210264) You should learn from it that however strong your heart and mind may be, if there is no strength in your hands and feet your progress will stop.
('98', 96, 6, 31, 210409) And are you going to let me down?

('98', 97, 6, 10, 211090) 88. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING 1
('98', 97, 7, 11, 211121) NEW DELHI, December 22, 1947
('98', 97, 8, 12, 211150) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, Some eight or ten miles from here, at Mehrauli, there is a shrine of Qutubuddin Bakhtiyar Chisti.
('98', 97, 8, 13, 211270) Esteemed as second only to the shrine at Ajmer, it is visited every year not only by Muslims but by thousands of non Muslims too.
('98', 97, 8, 14, 211400) Last September this shrine was subjected to the wrath of Hindu mobs.
('98', 97, 8, 15, 211469) The Muslims living in the vicinity of the shrine for the last 800 years had to leave their homes.
('98', 97, 8, 16, 211567) I mention this sad episode to tell you that, though Muslims love the shrine, today no Muslim can be found anywhere near it.
('98', 97, 8, 17, 211691) It is the duty of the Hindus, Sikhs, the officials and the Government to open the shrine again and wash off this stain on us.
('98', 97, 8, 18, 211817) The same applies to other shrines and religious places of Muslims in and around Delhi.
('98', 97, 8, 19, 211904) The time has come when both India and Pakistan must unequivocally declare to the majorities in each country that they will not tolerate desecration of religious places, be they small or big.
('98', 97, 8, 20, 212095) They should also undertake to
('98', 97, 9, 21, 212125) 1 As Gandhiji was observing silence, this was read out at the meeting.
('98', 98, 0, 1, 212196) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 99
('98', 98, 1, 2, 212242) repair the places damaged during riots.
('98', 98, 1, 3, 212282) Muslims have asked me whether, in view of the decision of the Muslim League in Karachi 1, members of the Muslim League should take part in the Conference called by Maulana Azad in Lucknow 2 and also whether Muslims might participate in the Conference of the Muslim League in Madras, and in any case what should be the course to be adopted by the members of the Muslim League in India.
('98', 98, 1, 4, 212667) I have not the least doubt that if they receive a personal or public invitation they should attend the Conferences in Lucknow and Madras.
('98', 98, 1, 5, 212805) They should fearlessly and openly declare their views at these meetings.
('98', 98, 1, 6, 212878) If they have learnt anything from the 30 years of non violent struggle they should not worry that they are in a minority in the Indian Union and that the majority in Pakistan can be of no help to them.
('98', 98, 1, 7, 213080) It does not need belief in non violence to see that a minority however small it may be has no reason to feel afraid for its honour and for the things it holds dear.
('98', 98, 1, 8, 213245) If man could but know his Maker and realize that he himself is a reflection of that Maker, no power on earth can take away his self respect.
('98', 98, 1, 9, 213386) No one can take away my self respect; I can only lose it.
('98', 98, 1, 10, 213444) During my struggle against the mighty Government of the Transvaal, a dear English friend of mine in Johannesburg used to tell me, “I always like to be with a minority, for a minority as a rule does not commit mistakes, and even if it does it can be rectified.
('98', 98, 1, 11, 213704) But a majority is drunk with power and it is difficult to reform it.” If by majority the friend also meant one sided armed might he was right.
('98', 98, 1, 12, 213847) We know from bitter experience how a handful of Englishmen had transformed themselves into a majority through force of arms and how they dominated the whole of India.
('98', 98, 1, 13, 214014) India lacked arms and, even if the arms had been there, we did not know how to use them.
('98', 98, 1, 14, 214103) It is a matter of regret that Hindus and Sikhs have not learnt a lesson from the British rule in our country.
('98', 98, 1, 15, 214213) The Muslims of the Union suffered from false pride in their majority in the East and the West.
('98', 98, 1, 16, 214308) Today they are rid of that burden.
('98', 98, 1, 17, 214343) If they now see the virtues of being a minority they will show the beauties of Islam in their own way.
('98', 98, 1, 18, 214446) They must
('98', 98, 2, 19, 214456) 1 The Council of the All India Muslim League had passed a resolution in Karachi on December 15, bifurcating the Muslim League into two bodies —one for Pakistan and the other for India.
('98', 98, 2, 20, 214641) 2 The Indian Union Muslims’ Conference was scheduled to be held in Lucknow on December 27 and 28 under the presidentship of Abul Kalam Azad.
('98', 98, 2, 21, 214782) Members of the Provincial Assemblies, the Constituent Assembly and various Muslim organizations had been invited to attend it.
('98', 99, 0, 1, 214909) 100 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 99, 1, 2, 214951) remember that the best days of Islam were the days of the Prophet Mohammed’s minority in Mecca.
('98', 99, 1, 3, 215047) Christianity began to decline after the time of Constantine 1. I do not want to prolong the argument here.
('98', 99, 1, 4, 215154) My advice emanates from my faith and if Muslim friends do not have this faith they are free to reject it.
('98', 99, 1, 5, 215260) In my view they should all be prepared to join the Congress.
('98', 99, 1, 6, 215321) But they must not apply for entry into that body till they are sure of a hearty welcome and equality of treatment.
('98', 99, 1, 7, 215436) In principle there is no question of majority and minority so far as the Congress is concerned.
('98', 99, 1, 8, 215532) The Congress follows no religion unless it be a religion of humanity.
('98', 99, 1, 9, 215602) It treats men and women alike.
('98', 99, 1, 10, 215633) It is a purely political body in which Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Parsees and Jews are all equal.
('98', 99, 1, 11, 215740) The Congress has not always been able to practise what it preached.
('98', 99, 1, 12, 215808) This sometimes created an impression among the Muslims that it was a caste Hindu organization.
('98', 99, 1, 13, 215903) In any case as long as this kind of tug of war goes on Muslims should keep away with dignity.
('98', 99, 1, 14, 215997) When the Congress wants their services they should come into the Congress.
('98', 99, 1, 15, 216072) Till then they can be servants of the Congress as I am a servant of the Congress.
('98', 99, 1, 16, 216154) Although I am not a four anna member of the Congress I have a voice in that organization, and that is because ever since 1915 when I returned from South Africa I have been loyally serving the Congress.
('98', 99, 1, 17, 216356) If every Muslim similarly serves the Congress he will find that his services are similarly appreciated.
('98', 99, 1, 18, 216460) Today every Muslim is considered a supporter of the League and therefore an enemy of the Congress.
('98', 99, 1, 19, 216559) This has been the unfortunate result of the teachings of the League.
('98', 99, 1, 20, 216628) Today there is no cause left any more for enmity.
('98', 99, 1, 21, 216678) Four months are a very short time for getting rid of the poison of communalism.
('98', 99, 1, 22, 216758) It is the misfortune of India that Hindus and Sikhs took this poison to be nectar and made themselves the enemies of the Muslim League.
('98', 99, 1, 23, 216894) In returning brickbat for brickbat they brought a stain to their name and put themselves in the same category as Muslims.
('98', 99, 1, 24, 217016) I appeal to the Muslim minority to raise themselves above this poisonous atmosphere, to remove the suspicion that had been created concerning them and to show that they could live in India as her honourable citizens without any deceit and dissimulation.
('98', 99, 1, 25, 217270) One consequence of partition is that the League cannot continue

('98', 100, 1, 2, 217465) as a political organization.
('98', 100, 1, 3, 217494) The Hindu Mahasabha, the Sikh Sabha and the Parsee Sabha similarly cannot continue as political bodies.
('98', 100, 1, 4, 217598) They may well stay as religious bodies.
('98', 100, 1, 5, 217638) Their task then will be internal reform of society, to seareh for things of religious value and to act on them.
('98', 100, 1, 6, 217750) Then the atmosphere will become free of poison and these organizations will rival each other in doing good.
('98', 100, 1, 7, 217858) They will have amity for each other and they will help the Government.
('98', 100, 1, 8, 217929) Their political ambitions can be realized through the Congress alone whether they are in the Congress or not.
('98', 100, 1, 9, 218039) If the Congress thinks only of those who are in the Congress it will become very narrow in its sphere of service.
('98', 100, 1, 10, 218153) Even today there are very few people in the Congress.
('98', 100, 1, 11, 218207) If no other organization can rival the Congress it is because the Congress has been trying to represent the whole of India, because it has dedicated itself to the service of the poorest and the lowliest.

('98', 100, 6, 19, 218635) If nothing happens in those days, I will agree with your view.
('98', 100, 6, 20, 218698) If you are to die, I should like to see you die with your head in my lap.
('98', 100, 6, 21, 218772) I see no possibility just now of such a thing happening.
('98', 100, 6, 22, 218829) But how can you die before I do?
('98', 100, 6, 23, 218862) The very thought is unbearable to me.
('98', 100, 6, 24, 218900) You should, therefore, resolve to live and make up your mind that, after leaving the sick bed, you will give yourself up to the service of the country.
('98', 100, 6, 25, 219052) God will, then, keep you alive if He needs your services; otherwise He will take you away.

('98', 101, 8, 17, 220144) You do have strength, don’t you?
('98', 101, 8, 18, 220177) Such massage does not require much physical strength.

('98', 102, 8, 14, 221234) I am stuck here for now.
('98', 102, 8, 15, 221259) I have no doubt that the needful should be done about the village industries.
('98', 102, 8, 16, 221337) It is our misfortune, however, that I see no concerted effort in any undertaking.
('98', 102, 8, 17, 221419) Of course one cannot complain if there is no unity; but what can be more painful than that such disunity should engender personal animosities?
('98', 102, 8, 18, 221562) I am at the moment passing through a situation which cannot even be dreamt of.
('98', 102, 8, 19, 221641) All the same I do not worry.
('98', 102, 8, 20, 221670) My only prayer to God in the present situation is “one step is enough for me”.
('98', 102, 8, 21, 221749) God will keep me as long as He needs me.
('98', 102, 8, 22, 221790) Why need I worry about it?

('98', 103, 3, 4, 222160) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, A friend suggests that since it is getting cold we should begin our prayer half an hour earlier, that is, at 5 p.
('98', 103, 3, 5, 222296) I admit it is getting to be pretty cold.
('98', 103, 3, 6, 222337) Though the days will be getting longer minute by minute from now on, for today it is already the 23rd of December, still if all of you so wish we can begin the prayer at 5 p.m.
('98', 103, 3, 7, 222514) from tomorrow.
('98', 103, 3, 8, 222529) 1 Today I shall deal with three points.
('98', 103, 3, 9, 222569) Here is the first.
('98', 103, 3, 10, 222588) You saw that yesterday people 2 arrived here from Bahawalpur.
('98', 103, 3, 11, 222650) They are in great distress.
('98', 103, 3, 12, 222678) 3 They say that all the Hindus and Sikhs there should be brought here for their lives are in danger.
('98', 103, 3, 13, 222779) Today two friends from Bahawalpur came to see me.
('98', 103, 3, 14, 222829) They said that if no steps were taken in this respect they would go and fast in front of the Governor General’s house.
('98', 103, 3, 15, 222948) I told them that their fasting could neither bring here the Hindus and Sikhs left behind nor ensure their safety.
('98', 103, 3, 16, 223062) That besides the Governor General had no power except such as he derived from his Cabinet.
('98', 103, 3, 17, 223153) He merely affixed his signature.
('98', 103, 3, 18, 223186) If they thought that fasting before the residence of Pandit Nehru or the Sardar would do any good they were equally mistaken.
('98', 103, 3, 19, 223312) They saw the point and gave up the idea of fasting.
('98', 103, 3, 20, 223364) Yesterday I was observing silence and so could not say anything.
('98', 103, 3, 21, 223429) The Nawab of Bahawalpur should permit all the Hindus and Sikhs to go wherever they want to.
('98', 103, 3, 22, 223521) If he does not he will be failing in his duty.
('98', 103, 3, 23, 223568) I cannot relate to you the things that have happened there under the very nose of the Nawab.
('98', 103, 3, 24, 223661) A large number of Hindus and Sikhs were tortured and killed.
('98', 103, 3, 25, 223722) It is the Sikhs who built Bahawalpur.
('98', 103, 3, 26, 223760) They are a brave people.
('98', 103, 3, 27, 223785) They can fight and cultivate land.
('98', 103, 3, 28, 223820) They have been cultivating the land
('98', 103, 4, 29, 223856) 1 Gandhiji asked those who wanted the prayers to be held earlier to raise their hands.
('98', 103, 4, 30, 223943) A large number of them raised their hands.
('98', 103, 4, 31, 223986) It was, therefore, decided to hold the prayers at 5 p.
('98', 103, 4, 32, 224041) 2 Who carried placards reading “Save the 70,000 Hindus and Sikhs of Bahawalpur” 3 In the State of Bahawalpur, which had acceded to Pakistan on November 8, seventy thousand Hindus and Sikhs were awaiting evacuation.
('98', 103, 4, 33, 224256) It was reported that the Pakistan authorities were not agreeing to their evacuation through the Military Evacuation Organization.
('98', 103, 4, 34, 224386) The Hindus and Sikhs concentrated in camps were without adequate food or clothing.
('98', 104, 0, 1, 224469) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 105
('98', 104, 1, 2, 224516) there; so have the Hindus.
('98', 104, 1, 3, 224543) They have committed no crime.
('98', 104, 1, 4, 224573) Their only crime is that they are Hindus or Sikhs.
('98', 104, 1, 5, 224624) A large number of these innocent people were murdered and some ran away.
('98', 104, 1, 6, 224697) When Hindus and Sikhs cannot live there in peace, what is the worth of anything that the Nawab may say?
('98', 104, 1, 7, 224801) I appeal to the Nawab that he should do his duty.
('98', 104, 1, 8, 224851) If Hindus and Sikhs cannot live there in honour he should arrange for them to leave or he should declare that none of the Hindus and Sikhs still in Bahawalpur will be touched and that they can continue to live in Bahawalpur in peace.
('98', 104, 1, 9, 225085) If they are starving, food should be made available to them.
('98', 104, 1, 10, 225146) According to a report in today’s Statesman about the refugee camps in Lahore, the Muslims in the camps are living in insanitary conditions.
('98', 104, 1, 11, 225286) Epidemics like cholera and smallpox have broken out and even those who have escaped them are dying of cold and exposure.
('98', 104, 1, 12, 225407) How can people live under the open sky in this cold?
('98', 104, 1, 13, 225460) They need shelter and clothes and food.
('98', 104, 1, 14, 225500) If these three things are not available they must face death.
('98', 104, 1, 15, 225562) I do not know all that is happening there.
('98', 104, 1, 16, 225605) Yes, scavengers have been brought over from Sialkot who will clean the camps and remove nightsoil.
('98', 104, 1, 17, 225704) The officials say that they are not doing enough work.
('98', 104, 1, 18, 225759) It is clear that the people there are in distress.
('98', 104, 1, 19, 225810) What does it matter that they are in Pakistan?
('98', 104, 1, 20, 225857) Why should human beings be so degraded?
('98', 104, 1, 21, 225897) It pains me.
('98', 104, 1, 22, 225910) Those people who ran away from here to escape our excesses were deprived of their hearths and homes.
('98', 104, 1, 23, 226011) They are not familiar with the surroundings there and they have to suffer hardships.
('98', 104, 1, 24, 226096) But why can’t they keep themselves clean?
('98', 104, 1, 25, 226138) I should advise all the refugees, be they in India or in Pakistan, that they should not be dependent on others for everything.
('98', 104, 1, 26, 226265) They should not ask for help to cook for them or to remove their night soil.
('98', 104, 1, 27, 226342) People who were being uprooted from their homes are in no position to make such demands.
('98', 104, 1, 28, 226431) It’s a privilege of the rich.
('98', 104, 1, 29, 226461) They may employ ten when one is enough, but not we.
('98', 104, 1, 30, 226513) These are the symptoms of our degradation.
('98', 104, 1, 31, 226556) The refugees in the camps in Lahore should firmly and courageously declare that they will not have scavengers from Sialkot, that they will themselves do the cleaning of their camps.
('98', 104, 1, 32, 226738) The Pakistan Government and the officials concerned should also make it clear to the refugees that they will not have scavengers brought from Sialkot.
('98', 104, 1, 33, 226889) They should at least do what every human being can do.
('98', 104, 1, 34, 226944) And if even then there are deaths, that will be a different matter.
('98', 104, 1, 35, 227012) I have said it before, and I say it again, that the refugees should conduct themselves with decency.
('98', 104, 1, 36, 227113) They should do all that they can do and not become a burden on others.
('98', 105, 0, 1, 227184) 106 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 105, 1, 2, 227226) And here is something good that I want to tell you.
('98', 105, 1, 3, 227278) I told you once that Pyarelal had come here.
('98', 105, 1, 4, 227323) You know who Pyarelal is.
('98', 105, 1, 5, 227349) He is my Secretary.
('98', 105, 1, 6, 227369) He had been working in Noakhali for a long time.
('98', 105, 1, 7, 227418) There were others with him too.
('98', 105, 1, 8, 227450) At the risk of their lives they gave support and courage to the Hindus who felt insecure there.
('98', 105, 1, 9, 227546) The Muslims too very soon understood that they were their friends and servants and had gone there not to promote violence but to promote amity between the two communities.
('98', 105, 1, 10, 227718) Pyarelal has some interesting news from Noakhali: A temple had been demolished and occupied by Muslims.
('98', 105, 1, 11, 227822) It became a cause of strife.
('98', 105, 1, 12, 227851) Later when the Muslims expressed their desire to live in amity with the Hindus, Pyarelal pointed out that the Hindus no longer had the temple where they could go and worship.
('98', 105, 1, 13, 228026) The Muslims thereupon rebuilt the temple with their own labour and assured the Hindus that they were free to go to the temple and offer worship.
('98', 105, 1, 14, 228171) Now they are all happy.
('98', 105, 1, 15, 228195) The officials too co operated.
('98', 105, 1, 16, 228226) If everyone in India and Pakistan acted in this spirit the faces of the two countries would change.
('98', 105, 1, 17, 228326) If we stick to our own religion and refrain from interfering with another’s, it will be a great thing.

('98', 105, 6, 23, 228563) ANAND, I have your letter.
('98', 105, 6, 24, 228590) I write this while drinking my hot water.
('98', 105, 6, 25, 228632) It is 5 a.
('98', 105, 6, 26, 228643) You seem to be much troubled by your ear.
('98', 105, 6, 27, 228685) If that is so, go to America and see what can be done about it.
('98', 105, 6, 28, 228749) If you can appreciate the blessing of not hearing, then there is no need to go anywhere.
('98', 105, 6, 29, 228838) What you need to know you can know with Gangi’s 1 assistance.

('98', 106, 3, 4, 229139) GANGI, I have your letter.
('98', 106, 3, 5, 229166) I am writing this with great difficulty, otherwise I would have to let your letter go unanswered.
('98', 106, 3, 6, 229264) There are no facilities for your staying with me in Delhi.
('98', 106, 3, 7, 229323) I am myself staying at the house of a rich man.
('98', 106, 3, 8, 229371) It is difficult to keep anyone with me here.
('98', 106, 3, 9, 229416) If I set up an ashram anywhere and stay there you can come.
('98', 106, 3, 10, 229476) But such an opportunity is impossible in this life.
('98', 106, 3, 11, 229528) Consider also that it is not your duty to leave Anand and go elsewhere.
('98', 106, 3, 12, 229600) I feel that as long as Anand finds his deafness an affliction, you cannot leave him.
('98', 106, 3, 13, 229685) Also Anand cannot move about by himself.
('98', 106, 3, 14, 229726) What can you learn by staying with me?
('98', 106, 3, 15, 229765) I consider it wrong for people to imagine that they gain anything by staying with me.

('98', 106, 8, 22, 230074) I am glad.
('98', 106, 8, 23, 230085) Although the sizing is done with good speed it must still be taking up a lot of time.
('98', 106, 8, 24, 230171) I understand doubling takes much less time and greatly facilitates the process of weaving.

('98', 107, 2, 3, 230422) NEW DELHI, December 24, 1947
('98', 107, 3, 4, 230451) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, I often receive Sikh visitors.
('98', 107, 3, 5, 230504) I also read newspapers sometimes.
('98', 107, 3, 6, 230538) They say that I have proved an enemy of the Sikhs.
('98', 107, 3, 7, 230589) They would not have minded it much but for the fact that my word seemed to carry weight with the world outside India where it is believed that India has secured its freedom through non violent means.
('98', 107, 3, 8, 230789) This had never happened before anywhere in the world.
('98', 107, 3, 9, 230843) But a tree is known by its fruit, and by no other means.
('98', 107, 3, 10, 230900) For man is not God, man can know a thing from its results.
('98', 107, 3, 11, 230959) The fruit of independence has been that today Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs have become one another’s enemies.
('98', 107, 3, 12, 231066) As I have admitted earlier I had been under the delusion that our struggle was truly non violent.
('98', 107, 3, 13, 231164) God had rendered me blind and I was misled.
('98', 107, 3, 14, 231208) Because the lame, the crippled, the coward cannot be non violent.
('98', 107, 3, 15, 231274) Lame, crippled and dumb I do not mean literally, for God helps these and they are always non violent.
('98', 107, 3, 16, 231376) Even a child can stand before the world on the strength of non violence.
('98', 107, 3, 17, 231449) Prahlad was an instance.
('98', 107, 3, 18, 231474) We do not know whether Prahlad was a historical character.
('98', 107, 3, 19, 231533) To me he was more than a historical character, for I believe in the story.
('98', 107, 3, 20, 231608) Prahlad’s father 1 commanded him not to utter the name of God.
('98', 107, 3, 21, 231671) But Prahlad insisted that he would continue to utter the name of God.
('98', 107, 3, 22, 231741) The image of 12 year old Prahlad remains before my eyes.
('98', 107, 3, 23, 231798) Therefore I say that those who are lame and crippled at heart can never be truly non violent.
('98', 107, 3, 24, 231892) So long as the light does not shine in the heart no one can understand the beauty of non violence.
('98', 107, 3, 25, 231991) What we offered during the struggle was passive resistance which simply meant that we would not kill the British though in our hearts we wanted to kill them.
('98', 107, 3, 26, 232149) But we had not the power.
('98', 107, 3, 27, 232175) When the millions took up passive resistance it did bring about our freedom.
('98', 107, 3, 28, 232252) The freedom we have obtained is crippled freedom.
('98', 107, 3, 29, 232302) It is only partial.
('98', 107, 3, 30, 232322) I therefore laugh when I see our Sikh brethren getting angry.
('98', 107, 3, 31, 232384) In my eyes there is no difference between the Hindus and the Sikhs.
('98', 107, 3, 32, 232452) I have read the
('98', 107, 4, 33, 232468) 1 Hiranyakashipu, the Demon king
('98', 108, 0, 1, 232501) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 109
('98', 108, 1, 2, 232548) Granthsaheb.
('98', 108, 1, 3, 232561) A friend chides me for not knowing anything about the Granthsaheb.
('98', 108, 1, 4, 232628) He says I cannot understand the Sikhs and that if I did, I would not have written what I wrote about Guru Govind Singh.
('98', 108, 1, 5, 232748) That was many years ago and the mistake was not mine.
('98', 108, 1, 6, 232802) But he still says so because he is a friend.
('98', 108, 1, 7, 232847) If I say that the Sikhs are taking to drinking and gambling it does not mean that it applies to all or only to Sikhs.
('98', 108, 1, 8, 232965) Hindus too are a prey to these evils but Hindus do not have the strength that the Sikhs have.
('98', 108, 1, 9, 233059) The Sikhs should not use that strength indiscriminately.
('98', 108, 1, 10, 233116) They may wield the sword but only where they must.
('98', 108, 1, 11, 233167) Their sword should not fall where it ought not to fall.
('98', 108, 1, 12, 233223) I am a true friend of the Sikhs when I say that anyone who commits crimes or is guilty of bad conduct sins before God.
('98', 108, 1, 13, 233342) He degrades his religion.
('98', 108, 1, 14, 233368) Today is the 24th.
('98', 108, 1, 15, 233387) Tomorrow is Christmas.
('98', 108, 1, 16, 233410) Christmas is to Christians what Diwali is to us.
('98', 108, 1, 17, 233459) Really neither Diwali nor Christmas is an occasion when we should indulge in revelry and lose our heads.
('98', 108, 1, 18, 233564) I do not regard Christmas as an occasion for people to indulge in drunkenness.
('98', 108, 1, 19, 233643) Christmas reminds one of Jesus Christ.
('98', 108, 1, 20, 233682) I offer greetings to the Christians in India and abroad.
('98', 108, 1, 21, 233739) May the New Year bring them prosperity and happiness.
('98', 108, 1, 22, 233793) It has never been my wish that the freedom of India should mean the ruin of the Christians here or that they should become Hindus or Muslims or Sikhs.
('98', 108, 1, 23, 233944) For a Christian to become a Hindu or a Muslim is a fate worse than death.
('98', 108, 1, 24, 234018) According to my view a Christian should become a better Christian, a Muslim a better Muslim and a Sikh a better Sikh.
('98', 108, 1, 25, 234136) I want that all the Christians in and outside India should become free in the true sense.
('98', 108, 1, 26, 234226) Let them exercise self restraint and pursue the path of sacrifice and martyrdom shown by Jesus Christ.
('98', 108, 1, 27, 234329) Let them be free and increase the area of freedom in the world.
('98', 108, 1, 28, 234393) I see from the papers that the Government proposes to stop the grants made to them.
('98', 108, 1, 29, 234477) The money they receive from America and England will also stop coming.
('98', 108, 1, 30, 234548) It is feared that 75% of the churches in India will have to be closed down.
('98', 108, 1, 31, 234624) But a religion does not prosper with the help of money.
('98', 108, 1, 32, 234680) Most Christians in India are poor people.
('98', 108, 1, 33, 234722) What does it matter if the Government help should stop?
('98', 108, 1, 34, 234778) They should be glad that they will now be free of the curse of pecuniary assistance.
('98', 108, 1, 35, 234863) once a lot of money and presents came into the house of Hazarat Omar.
('98', 108, 1, 36, 234933) This worried Omar and he told his wife that with all that wealth he was no longer certain if he would be able to retain his self control and would not take to pleasure.
('98', 108, 1, 37, 235102) A church does not need a building.
('98', 108, 1, 38, 235137) The human body is the real church.
('98', 108, 1, 39, 235172) It is there that God dwells.
('98', 108, 1, 40, 235201) Then we have the sky for the roof and the
('98', 109, 0, 1, 235243) 110 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

('98', 109, 1, 3, 235306) We can utter God’s name anywhere.
('98', 109, 1, 4, 235340) I shall therefore say that the Christians need not feel worried.
('98', 109, 1, 5, 235405) They do not really need assistance from the Government or anyone.
('98', 109, 1, 6, 235471) They should follow the teachings of their religion.
('98', 109, 1, 7, 235523) If they but persevere in the path of sacrifice shown by Christ, no one can take their religion away from them.

('98', 109, 5, 12, 235734) NEW DELHI, December 25, 1947
('98', 109, 6, 13, 235763) BHAI HAMID UD DIN, I got your letter about Barwani.
('98', 109, 6, 14, 235815) I have been doing what I can ever since the first telegram came.
('98', 109, 6, 15, 235880) The local Muslims have some staunch Hindus for their friends.
('98', 109, 6, 16, 235942) I am also in correspondence with them.
('98', 109, 6, 17, 235981) They are working hard.
('98', 109, 6, 18, 236004) Isn’t there exaggeration in what you write?
('98', 109, 6, 19, 236048) It happened in the case of Junagadh.
('98', 109, 6, 20, 236085) My informants were well placed Muslims.
('98', 109, 6, 21, 236125) They had exaggerated matters to such an extent that at last they had to publicly issue a correction and apologize.
('98', 109, 6, 22, 236240) I am not bothered about it but at present such exaggeration gives rise to dislike of all Muslims.
('98', 109, 6, 23, 236338) And this hurts me very much.
('98', 109, 6, 24, 236367) I am therefore sounding a note of caution to you.
('98', 109, 6, 25, 236417) After all the Government officers have also taken some steps.
('98', 109, 6, 26, 236479) Please let me have whatever authoritative information you have.

('98', 109, 10, 31, 236652) No one can harm a person who is sustained by Ramanama.
('98', 109, 10, 32, 236707) I believe in this principle and so I have no physical illness.
('98', 109, 10, 33, 236770) It is by the grace of God that I am able to remain calm even though there is conflagration all around.
('98', 109, 10, 34, 236873) Had it not been for this I would have broken down by now.
('98', 109, 10, 35, 236931) That is why I proclaim at the top of my voice that I dance as Rama wills.
('98', 109, 10, 36, 237005) We are in this world to do our duty.
('98', 109, 10, 37, 237042) I believe that not a leaf moves without His command.

('98', 110, 1, 3, 237204) But God is magnanimous and only laughs at this abysmal ignorance.
('98', 110, 1, 4, 237270) Now you will all understand where I am.
('98', 110, 1, 5, 237310) You must all be well.
('98', 110, 1, 6, 237332) What I write in Harijan shows me as I am.
('98', 110, 1, 7, 237374) I am very clear about the language.
('98', 110, 1, 8, 237410) In the same way I am clear about the political questions.

('98', 110, 6, 14, 237590) Slackness in khadi work will not do.
('98', 110, 6, 15, 237627) We should understand that the more we slacken the more we shall fall behind.
('98', 110, 6, 16, 237704) This fragile thread has had behind it sixty long years of work.
('98', 110, 6, 17, 237768) It still remains unbroken and thanks to it we have reached our present position.
('98', 110, 6, 18, 237849) Even now I am convinced that if only we had plied the wheel more vigourously, the thread would not have broken even as slightly as it has.
('98', 110, 6, 19, 237988) If we do not want to preserve what we have gained, then certainly we may let the thread snap.
('98', 110, 6, 20, 238082) Fragile as this thread is, it has the strength to bind not only India but the whole world.
('98', 110, 6, 21, 238173) My purpose in labouring the point is simply this: If India is to live and live well there is no alternative to the constructive programme.

('98', 110, 11, 28, 238555) To ask for money immediately does not seem to be proper.
('98', 110, 11, 29, 238612) I do not consider it right now to insert a condition which is not there in the written agreement.
('98', 110, 11, 30, 238710) I do not remember now if I had said anything.
('98', 110, 11, 31, 238756) If I did, surely my signature would be there.
('98', 110, 11, 32, 238802) I find a great difference between dealers in uncertified khadi and Khadi Pratishthan.
('98', 110, 11, 33, 238888) Khadi Pratishthan was born for khadi and will

('98', 111, 1, 3, 238988) Other dealers carry on their business for the sake of business.
('98', 111, 1, 4, 239052) They also practise dishonesty.
('98', 111, 1, 5, 239083) Even so I shall send your letter on to Khadi Pratishthan and ask them.
('98', 111, 2, 6, 239154) Are those who deal with the Hindustani correspondence there fully familiar with Hindustani?
('98', 111, 2, 7, 239246) In your letter

('98', 111, 8, 14, 239500) Please let me know about the matter.
('98', 111, 8, 15, 239537) I feel that as the rules of the Sangh 4 stand Khadi Pratishthan is an uncertified body.
('98', 111, 8, 16, 239625) I enclose a copy of the letter I have written to Krishnadas.
('98', 111, 8, 17, 239686) I hope Babua is well and Didimoni too.

('98', 111, 13, 24, 239939) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, You all know something of what is happening in Kashmir.
('98', 111, 13, 25, 240017) But I want to draw your attention to a proposal about Kashmir.
('98', 111, 13, 26, 240080) It is being said and also reported in the newspapers that we should invite someone to arbitrate between the Indian Union and Pakistan in the

('98', 112, 1, 2, 240417) dispute over Kashmir.
('98', 112, 1, 3, 240439) How can this be?
('98', 112, 1, 4, 240456) How long can this kind of thing go on?
('98', 112, 1, 5, 240495) Instead of resulting in a settlement of the dispute, this will merely introduce into it a third party.
('98', 112, 1, 6, 240598) Can we not settle the issue between ourselves?
('98', 112, 1, 7, 240645) There is a large preponderance of Muslims in Kashmir.
('98', 112, 1, 8, 240699) Maybe they are more than 95% .
('98', 112, 1, 9, 240730) Jammu does not have very many Muslims.
('98', 112, 1, 10, 240769) I do not know what is the percentage of Muslims in the population but Jammu and Kashmir is one State.
('98', 112, 1, 11, 240871) It cannot be partitioned.
('98', 112, 1, 12, 240897) If we start the process of partitioning where is it going to end?
('98', 112, 1, 13, 240963) It is enough and more than enough that India has been partitioned into two.
('98', 112, 1, 14, 241039) If we partition Kashmir, why not other States?
('98', 112, 1, 15, 241086) What is the nature of the dispute in Kashmir?
('98', 112, 1, 16, 241132) It is said that the raiders are outsiders.
('98', 112, 1, 17, 241175) They are aggressors and plunderers.
('98', 112, 1, 18, 241211) But as time passes it looks as if it was not so.
('98', 112, 1, 19, 241260) I get some Urdu newspapers.
('98', 112, 1, 20, 241288) I can read Urdu a little myself and others also read them out to me.
('98', 112, 1, 21, 241357) Today some bits from the Zamindar were read out to me.
('98', 112, 1, 22, 241412) I know the editor 1
('98', 112, 2, 23, 241432) of the Zamindar.
('98', 112, 2, 24, 241449) He has an unbridled tongue.
('98', 112, 2, 25, 241477) He has issued an open invitation to all Muslims to muster for an assault on Kashmir.
('98', 112, 2, 26, 241562) He has heaped abuse on the Dogras and the Sikhs.
('98', 112, 2, 27, 241611) He calls the raid in Kashmir a jihad 2. But there is always restraint about a jihad.
('98', 112, 2, 28, 241696) There is nothing of the kind here.
('98', 112, 2, 29, 241731) Do they want that Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims should perpetually remain divided?
('98', 112, 2, 30, 241810) What is our duty if Muslims start cutting up the Hindus and Sikhs?
('98', 112, 2, 31, 241877) As I have been telling you every day Hindus and Sikhs must not retaliate.
('98', 112, 2, 32, 241951) The simple fact is that Pakistan has invaded Kashmir.
('98', 112, 2, 33, 242005) Units of the Indian army have gone to Kashmir but not to invade Kashmir.
('98', 112, 2, 34, 242078) They have been sent on the express invitation of the Maharaja and Sheikh Abdullah.
('98', 112, 2, 35, 242161) Sheikh Abdullah is the real Maharaja of Kashmir.
('98', 112, 2, 36, 242210) Muslims in their thousands are devoted to him.
('98', 112, 2, 37, 242257) He is called the Lion of Kashmir.
('98', 112, 2, 38, 242291) One should always admit one’s mistakes.
('98', 112, 2, 39, 242331) The Hindus and Sikhs of Jammu or those who had gone there from outside killed Muslims there.
('98', 112, 2, 40, 242424) The Maharaja of Kashmir is responsible for the happenings in his State.
('98', 112, 2, 41, 242496) It was not Sheikh Abdullah who was behind these murders.
('98', 112, 2, 42, 242553) He in fact went to Jammu and tried to reason with the Hindus and Sikhs.
('98', 112, 2, 43, 242625) He tried to save the lives of Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs.
('98', 112, 2, 44, 242682) The Maharaja of Kashmir is a Dogra Rajput.
('98', 112, 2, 45, 242725) Abuses have been heaped on him.
('98', 112, 2, 46, 242757) If he has been at fault he can be removed.
('98', 112, 2, 47, 242800) One can understand

('98', 113, 0, 1, 242884) 114 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 113, 1, 2, 242926) But what have the Muslims of Kashmir done?
('98', 113, 1, 3, 242969) Why is jihad being carried on against them?
('98', 113, 1, 4, 243013) I want to say to the Government of Pakistan in all humility that if their claim to being the greatest Islamic power in the world is true, they should make sure that every Hindu and every Sikh in Pakistan is justly treated.
('98', 113, 1, 5, 243236) They should be protected.
('98', 113, 1, 6, 243262) But Pakistan presents a different picture.
('98', 113, 1, 7, 243305) I shall advise Pakistan and India to sit together and decide the matter.
('98', 113, 1, 8, 243378) If the two are interested in the settlement of the dispute, where is the need for an arbitrator?
('98', 113, 1, 9, 243475) The Maharaja can step aside and let India and Pakistan deliberate over the matter.
('98', 113, 1, 10, 243558) Sheikh Abdullah will of course be there.
('98', 113, 1, 11, 243599) If they want an arbitrator they can appoint one from among themselves, but it should certainly not be a third power.
('98', 113, 1, 12, 243716) They may, if they so desire, persuade the Maharaja to step down.
('98', 113, 1, 13, 243781) After all he is a human being.
('98', 113, 1, 14, 243812) A large number of Muslims have been killed there and Muslim women have been dishonoured.
('98', 113, 1, 15, 243901) I met the Maharaja and his Prime Minister.
('98', 113, 1, 16, 243944) And I told him what I had to say.
('98', 113, 1, 17, 243978) The Maharaja should clearly say that he is no longer the Ruler, it is the Muslims of Kashmir who are the real rulers and they may do what they like.
('98', 113, 1, 18, 244127) After the Maharaja and his Prime Minister withdraw themselves only Sheikh Abdullah remains.
('98', 113, 1, 19, 244219) He can form an interim government and restore law and order.
('98', 113, 1, 20, 244280) The armies can be withdrawn.
('98', 113, 1, 21, 244309) If the two countries arrive at a settlement on these lines it will be good for both.
('98', 113, 1, 22, 244394) It is not that India had invaded a Muslim State or had gone there to help the Maharaja.
('98', 113, 1, 23, 244482) Our Government is for the people and it is in the interest of the people that we enter into negotiations with the Princes.
('98', 113, 1, 24, 244605) The Congress Government can take no other course.
('98', 113, 1, 25, 244655) I saw a couplet in an Urdu magazine today.
('98', 113, 1, 26, 244698) It hurt me.
('98', 113, 1, 27, 244710) I do not remember the words but the substance is this: “Today Somnath is on the tongue of everyone.
('98', 113, 1, 28, 244810) If the temple is renovated it will have to be avenged.
('98', 113, 1, 29, 244865) A new Ghazni must come from Ghazni to avenge what happened in Junagadh.” It is painful to think that such a thing can issue from the pen of a Muslim.
('98', 113, 1, 30, 245015) I have said that I must do or die; which means that I shall either bring about Hindu Muslim amity or lay down my life.
('98', 113, 1, 31, 245134) This sort of thing cannot affect my resolve.
('98', 113, 1, 32, 245179) I cannot return evil for evil.
('98', 113, 1, 33, 245210) I can only return good for evil.
('98', 113, 1, 34, 245243) I tell you all this so that you may not be taken in by such things.
('98', 113, 1, 35, 245311) You must not remember the wrong that Ghaznavi did.
('98', 113, 1, 36, 245362) Muslims should realize and admit the wrongs perpetrated under the Islamic rule.
('98', 113, 1, 37, 245442) The Hindu and Sikh rulers of Kashmir and Patiala, etc., should also admit the excesses committed

('98', 114, 1, 2, 245586) in their States.
('98', 114, 1, 3, 245603) There is nothing to be ashamed of in confessing one’s sins, it only lightens one’s guilt.
('98', 114, 1, 4, 245693) If Muslims in the Indian Union teach their children that a Ghaznavi must come to avenge them and destroy the Hindus, who is going to tolerate this?
('98', 114, 1, 5, 245841) If this mischievous couplet had not been published in an important magazine I would not even have mentioned it.

('98', 114, 10, 20, 246463) I have had your letter and the report of our conversation 3 read out to me just now (at a quarter to five in the morning).
('98', 114, 10, 21, 246586) You have taken great pains over the report.

('98', 114, 11, 26, 247111) Gandhiji’s article “Navin Vidyapitho”, which could admit of the interpretation that he was opposed to the proposed university in Gujarat, was being quoted against it.
('98', 114, 11, 27, 247278) The addressee, therefore, had a frank talk on the subject with Gandhiji on December 11. For Gandhiji’s article, vide “Of New Universities”, 25 10 1947.

('98', 115, 1, 2, 247472) much labour.
('98', 115, 1, 3, 247485) You have, of course, summarized my views quite well.
('98', 115, 1, 4, 247538) 1 I don’t feel at all like adding to or removing anything from the summary.
('98', 115, 1, 5, 247614) I learnt one new fact from you, namely, that Gujarat is the only linguistic region now left without a regional university.
('98', 115, 1, 6, 247737) I must admit that this fact weakens my case.
('98', 115, 1, 7, 247782) Even so, I do wish that this last regional university to be established would help in the progress of Indian civilization, which means the civilization of the country’s villages.
('98', 115, 1, 8, 247961) You may, if you wish, describe this desire as a form of greed or ignorant attachment on my part.
('98', 115, 1, 9, 248058) I still believe that, if the people loved the country as a whole rather than their respective regions, we should be able to bring about the establishment of linguistic provinces in a few months.
('98', 115, 1, 10, 248253) You and I should, therefore, prove that your fear 2 will prove groundless and that my dream will be realized.
('98', 115, 1, 11, 248363) We should exert ourselves to the utmost to that end.
('98', 115, 1, 12, 248416) My regret is that I am not in a position just now to join in such an effort.
('98', 115, 1, 13, 248493) I will, therefore, rest content with writing an occasional article in Harijan on the subject or addressing such a letter to you.
('98', 115, 1, 14, 248622) I hope you are keeping good health.

('98', 115, 5, 18, 248720) NEW DELHI, December 26, 1947
('98', 115, 6, 19, 248749) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, I am happy and also sorry to announce that we shall not be having our prayer here tomorrow.
('98', 115, 6, 20, 248863) Instead I shall be going to Sambhal, where a village panchayat has been formed.
('98', 115, 6, 21, 248943) It is thought that because of my visit a large number of people will gather there.
('98', 115, 6, 22, 249026) We shall have the prayer there.
('98', 115, 6, 23, 249058) I have never been to that village before.
('98', 115, 6, 24, 249100) They say the distance is about 11 miles, maybe a mile less or more.
('98', 115, 6, 25, 249168) We shall of course have our prayer the day after tomorrow.
('98', 115, 7, 26, 249227) 1 While Gandhiji accepted the principle of universities being based on regional languages, he maintained that the linguistic redistribution of provinces should first be accomplished.
('98', 115, 7, 27, 249410) 2 Namely, that the linguistic redistribution of provinces might take years
('98', 116, 0, 1, 249485) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 117
('98', 116, 1, 2, 249532) Today I wish to tell you about the Tibbia College.
('98', 116, 1, 3, 249583) Both Hindu and Muslim students joined it for studying Ayurveda which was taught there.
('98', 116, 1, 4, 249670) Later, courses in Yunani, allopathy and homoeopathy were added.
('98', 116, 1, 5, 249734) Hakim Ajmalkhan was the founder of the college.
('98', 116, 1, 6, 249782) He was a popular leader of Delhi.
('98', 116, 1, 7, 249816) Today we have made ourselves enemies of Muslims.
('98', 116, 1, 8, 249865) It was not so when we thought of starting this college where everyone irrespective of communal considerations could study medicine.
('98', 116, 1, 9, 249997) All contributed freely.
('98', 116, 1, 10, 250021) Among the donors were Hindu Rajas and Muslim Nawabs.
('98', 116, 1, 11, 250074) The late Dr. Ansari worked hard to make the scheme a success.
('98', 116, 1, 12, 250136) It was under the management of a Trust which had on its board Hindus and Muslims.
('98', 116, 1, 13, 250218) Today some Hindu friends came to me and asked what would happen to the college now.
('98', 116, 1, 14, 250302) They said it was difficult to continue it under the present circumstances.
('98', 116, 1, 15, 250377) Funds had ceased to come.
('98', 116, 1, 16, 250403) It would be a matter of grief and shame if such a large institution had to close down.
('98', 116, 1, 17, 250490) I am trying my best to avoid this calamity.
('98', 116, 1, 18, 250534) The college is situated in Karol Bagh.
('98', 116, 1, 19, 250573) But Muslim boys fear to go anywhere near it.
('98', 116, 1, 20, 250618) We have driven out Muslims from Panipat.
('98', 116, 1, 21, 250659) It is still a moot question where they will be able to live.
('98', 116, 1, 22, 250720) It is a matter of shame for us.
('98', 116, 1, 23, 250752) It seems that we are doing our best to ruin ourselves.
('98', 116, 1, 24, 250807) For, when we try to ruin others we ruin ourselves.
('98', 116, 1, 25, 250858) This is the rule of life.
('98', 116, 1, 26, 250884) Another matter I wish to speak about is that of abducted girls.
('98', 116, 1, 27, 250948) I spoke on the matter once.
('98', 116, 1, 28, 250976) 1 But I must speak again and again, for only then will the people understand.
('98', 116, 1, 29, 251054) It is not a question of a mere ten or twenty girls.
('98', 116, 1, 30, 251106) The number could be in hundreds or even thousands.
('98', 116, 1, 31, 251157) Nobody knows.
('98', 116, 1, 32, 251171) Where are all those girls?
('98', 116, 1, 33, 251198) Muslims have abducted Hindu and Sikh girls.
('98', 116, 1, 34, 251242) We want to recover them.
('98', 116, 1, 35, 251267) In Lahore some Hindu, Muslim and Sikh women met and decided to have these abducted girls recovered and restored to their homes.
('98', 116, 1, 36, 251395) They decided that Muslim girls carried away by Hindus and Sikhs should also be returned.
('98', 116, 1, 37, 251484) I have received a long list of girls abducted from Patiala.
('98', 116, 1, 38, 251544) Some of them come from very well to do Muslim families.
('98', 116, 1, 39, 251600) When they are recovered it will not be difficult for them to be returned to their parents.
('98', 116, 1, 40, 251691) As regards Hindu girls it is still doubtful whether they will be accepted by their families.
('98', 116, 1, 41, 251784) This is very bad.
('98', 116, 1, 42, 251802) If a girl has lost her parents or husband it is not her fault.
('98', 116, 1, 43, 251865) And yet Hindu society does not look upon such a girl with respect any more.
('98', 116, 1, 44, 251941) The mistake is ours, not the girl’s.
('98', 116, 1, 45, 251978) Even if the girl has been forced into marriage by a Muslim, even if she has been violated, I would still take her back with respect.
('98', 116, 2, 46, 252111) 1Vide “Speech at Prayer Meeting”, 7 12 1947.
('98', 117, 0, 1, 252156) 118 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 117, 1, 2, 252198) do not want that a single Hindu or Sikh should take up the attitude that if a girl has been abducted by a Muslim she is no longer acceptable to society.
('98', 117, 1, 3, 252351) We should not hate her.
('98', 117, 1, 4, 252375) We should sympathize with her and take pity on her.
('98', 117, 1, 5, 252427) If a girl is a Sikh, in my eyes she remains a Sikh, if a Hindu, she remains a Hindu.
('98', 117, 1, 6, 252512) If my daughter has been violated by a rascal and made pregnant, must I cast her and her child away?
('98', 117, 1, 7, 252612) Nor can I take the position that the child so born is Muslim by faith.
('98', 117, 1, 8, 252683) Its faith can only be the faith of the mother who bore it.
('98', 117, 1, 9, 252742) After the child grows up he or she will be free to take up any religion.
('98', 117, 1, 10, 252815) Today we are in such an unfortunate situation that some girls say that they do not want to come back, for they know that if they return they will only face disgrace and humiliation.
('98', 117, 1, 11, 252997) The parents will tell them to go away, so will the husbands.
('98', 117, 1, 12, 253058) I have suggested that a sort of home should be established for such girls which should take up the responsibility for their food and shelter and education, so that they can stand on their own feet.
('98', 117, 1, 13, 253256) These girls are innocent.
('98', 117, 1, 14, 253282) The culprits are those—be they Hindus or Muslims or Sikhs—who have abducted them.
('98', 117, 1, 15, 253364) Let the Hindus and Sikhs who have abducted Muslim girls return them.
('98', 117, 1, 16, 253433) Let the Muslims who have abducted Hindu and Sikh girls return them.
('98', 117, 1, 17, 253501) And let them confess publicly that they are guilty.
('98', 117, 1, 18, 253553) The list I have received makes me tremble.
('98', 117, 1, 19, 253596) What has happened in Kashmir?
('98', 117, 1, 20, 253626) A large number of Muslims have been slaughtered.
('98', 117, 1, 21, 253675) Women have been slaughtered and young girls have been abducted.
('98', 117, 1, 22, 253739) If my voice can reach those guilty of this outrage, I shall ask them to return all those girls.
('98', 117, 1, 23, 253835) I am told that several hundred Hindu and Sikh girls had similarly been carried away.
('98', 117, 1, 24, 253920) I am also told that a certain pir 1 is holding in his house a large number of Hindu and Sikh girls.
('98', 117, 1, 25, 254020) Those who have abducted them are reported to have said that they do not mean to harm or dishonour these girls in any way but that they will not return them so long as the abducted Muslim girls are not returned.
('98', 117, 1, 26, 254231) This will be a wicked bargain.
('98', 117, 1, 27, 254262) We should not act in such a way.
('98', 117, 1, 28, 254295) We should behave like decent men.
('98', 117, 1, 29, 254329) We must return all the abducted girls without any preconditions.
('98', 117, 1, 30, 254394) If we want to retain our freedom we must learn decency of conduct.

('98', 118, 4, 6, 254792) I suppose you know that though I talk about notations, my ignorance of the language of notation is deplorable.

('98', 120, 2, 3, 257373) SAMBHAL, December 27, 1947
('98', 120, 3, 4, 257400) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, It gives me special pleasure to hold a prayer meeting in this village.
('98', 120, 3, 5, 257493) You should not thank me or give me an address of welcome or garland me.
('98', 120, 3, 6, 257565) Prayer is our dharma.
('98', 120, 3, 7, 257587) We pray when we get up in the morning.
('98', 120, 3, 8, 257626) We should pray regularly morning and evening.
('98', 120, 3, 9, 257672) In the evening at 5, or earlier in winter, we can have congregational prayer.
('98', 120, 3, 10, 257750) We must utter God’s name when we stand or sleep or eat.
('98', 120, 3, 11, 257806) We must also remember God when at work.
('98', 120, 3, 12, 257846) We should not give ourselves to selfish pursuits.
('98', 120, 3, 13, 257896) We must pursue the path of service.
('98', 120, 3, 14, 257932) I have too little time now to explain to you the whole significance of prayer.
('98', 120, 3, 15, 258011) Though, as I have told you, I want no addresses of welcome and garlands, still since you have given me these I thank you for the honour.
('98', 120, 3, 16, 258148) You speak in your address of the greatness of truth and non violence.
('98', 120, 3, 17, 258218) But if our conduct is not in conformity with truth and non violence, talking of them is hypocritical.
('98', 120, 3, 18, 258320) I do not like this.
('98', 120, 3, 19, 258340) Ever since I came to India from South Africa I had been travelling all over the country.
('98', 120, 3, 20, 258429) I have traversed India many times and seen thousands of villages.
('98', 120, 3, 21, 258495) People talk of truth and non violence but they do not act accordingly.
('98', 120, 3, 22, 258566) They think in one way, speak in another and act in yet another way.
('98', 120, 3, 23, 258634) It is a matter of shame for us that in India Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs should be slaughtering one another.
('98', 120, 3, 24, 258741) Mercifully there have been no riots here in and around your village because the number of Muslims here is small and they can do no harm.
('98', 120, 3, 25, 258878) If we want to behave as enemies of one another, let us at any rate stop talking of ahimsa.
('98', 120, 3, 26, 258969) Let us be truthful to this extent.
('98', 120, 3, 27, 259004) We have not become free in order to slaughter one another.
('98', 120, 3, 28, 259063) Freedom means that we should voluntarily do what is good.
('98', 120, 3, 29, 259121) We have become free to do good, not to do evil.
('98', 120, 3, 30, 259169) We never pray to God to let us utter falsehoods.
('98', 120, 3, 31, 259218) If we do that it would be surrender to Satan.
('98', 120, 3, 32, 259264) It is a good thing you have formed a panchayat.
('98', 120, 3, 33, 259312) But if it does not function properly and is a panchayat only in name, it will do no good.
('98', 120, 3, 34, 259402) In former times there used to be real panchayats in the villages of India.
('98', 120, 3, 35, 259477) Even I have not seen them.
('98', 120, 3, 36, 259504) But travellers from China and Greece have reported about them.
('98', 120, 3, 37, 259567) These travellers were not paid by

('98', 121, 1, 4, 259679) They came on their own undergoing great hardships.
('98', 121, 1, 5, 259730) They came in order to gain knowledge.
('98', 121, 1, 6, 259768) They write that there were at the time no thefts anywhere in India; there were no locks on the doors.
('98', 121, 1, 7, 259870) All this was not what happened thousands of years ago.
('98', 121, 1, 8, 259925) Our history does not go back to thousands of years.
('98', 121, 1, 9, 259977) Formerly there were four varnas 1 Today these have grown into a large number.
('98', 121, 1, 10, 260055) It becomes meaningless to call them varnas.
('98', 121, 1, 11, 260099) It is a great responsibility you have assumed in forming a panchayat.
('98', 121, 1, 12, 260169) The cows yield so little milk that many people say that they should be slaughtered.
('98', 121, 1, 13, 260253) Muslims no doubt slaughter cows.
('98', 121, 1, 14, 260286) But no one in the world slaughters as many cows as the Hindus do.
('98', 121, 1, 15, 260352) Hindus do not treat the cows well.
('98', 121, 1, 16, 260387) They do not know how to look after them.
('98', 121, 1, 17, 260428) This amounts to slowly killing the cows.
('98', 121, 1, 18, 260469) It is much better to kill them all at once.
('98', 121, 1, 19, 260513) We worship cows and yet treat them most cruelly.
('98', 121, 1, 20, 260562) I shall say your panchayat has done something if at the end of the year the cows that today give three seers of milk give six.
('98', 121, 1, 21, 260689) Similarly you should produce twice the present amount of foodgrain.
('98', 121, 1, 22, 260757) You can do so by giving to the land the nourishment that it needs.
('98', 121, 1, 23, 260824) Mirabehn had called a conference which was attended by a large number of people.
('98', 121, 1, 24, 260905) They came to the conclusion that all the cow dung, human faeces and vegetable waste available in villages could be turned into rich manure.
('98', 121, 1, 25, 261045) It requires not expenditure but a little labour and it increases the fertility of the soil.
('98', 121, 1, 26, 261137) I do not know how clean you keep your village.
('98', 121, 1, 27, 261184) But it is your paramount duty to make yourselves strong.
('98', 121, 1, 28, 261241) You must keep yourselves clean externally and internally.
('98', 121, 1, 29, 261299) Your village should be free of dirt and dung in every way.
('98', 121, 1, 30, 261358) And it should be free from foul smells.
('98', 121, 1, 31, 261398) You should follow the rules of sanitation.
('98', 121, 1, 32, 261441) Why do you need a cinema here?
('98', 121, 1, 33, 261472) Instead of this, you can perform the various plays and stage dramas known to us.
('98', 121, 1, 34, 261553) The cinema will only make you spend money.
('98', 121, 1, 35, 261596) Then you will also learn to gamble and fall into other evil habits.
('98', 121, 1, 36, 261664) Those addicted to alcohol, ganja 2 and bhang 3 should give up these addictions.
('98', 121, 1, 37, 261744) Then I shall feel that your Panchayat has done some good work.
('98', 121, 1, 38, 261807) Then people will come from Delhi to see your village.
('98', 121, 1, 39, 261861) You must forget untouchability.
('98', 121, 1, 40, 261893) If you will

('98', 122, 6, 13, 262554) India fought for 30 years without sympathy from outside.

('98', 122, 12, 21, 263031) You will be surprised to learn that I did not find even one of them worth publishing.
('98', 122, 12, 22, 263117) The article about villages does not apply to our conditions.
('98', 122, 12, 23, 263178) A few selected paragraphs from it may be published.
('98', 122, 12, 24, 263230) There does not appear to be much in the one about the fox and the hare.
('98', 122, 12, 25, 263302) It seems you have not seen Dacca.
('98', 122, 12, 26, 263336) The stopping of races there will have no effect in Calcutta.

('98', 123, 6, 7, 264013) I got your letter regarding Mahadev 2. It will be published in Harijan as suggested by you.

('98', 123, 13, 13, 264338) BROTHERS, If you will be quiet you will be able to hear me.
('98', 123, 13, 14, 264398) I have come here only for one thing and that is to say a few words about the controls.
('98', 123, 13, 15, 264485) I feel that the control imposed on foodgrain is bad.
('98', 123, 13, 16, 264538) It cannot
('98', 123, 14, 17, 264548) 1 Reviewing the Government scheme for shipping, J. C. Kumarappa in his article, “A Rudderless Shipping Programme”, wrote that the scheme was not well conceived and lacked proper thought and appreciation of organization.
('98', 123, 14, 18, 264768) He suggested that the question needed to be handled with care, deep thought and tact, and that the Government should take into confidence the various interests affected by the industry, while drafting a workable scheme.

('98', 124, 1, 2, 265351) do any good to India.
('98', 124, 1, 3, 265373) Control on cloth should also go.
('98', 124, 1, 4, 265406) When ours is a free country, why should we have controls?
('98', 124, 1, 5, 265464) Jawaharlal, Sardar Patel and others are the servants of the people.
('98', 124, 1, 6, 265532) They cannot do anything against the wishes of the people.
('98', 124, 1, 7, 265590) They cannot hold their offices if we ask them to step down.
('98', 124, 1, 8, 265650) They themselves are not keen to stay on.
('98', 124, 1, 9, 265691) They always say that they want to work for the people and that they are the servants of the people.
('98', 124, 1, 10, 265791) It is also true.
('98', 124, 1, 11, 265808) We fought the British for thirty two years and in that we have shown how true democracy functions.
('98', 124, 1, 12, 265907) Our strength is not like that of the British.
('98', 124, 1, 13, 265953) They could have summoned armed forces from England.
('98', 124, 1, 14, 266005) We do not have all that.
('98', 124, 1, 15, 266030) But our Ministers have greater force than the armed force.
('98', 124, 1, 16, 266089) Jawaharlal, Sardar Patel and others have the might of public opinion at their back which is greater than the might of an army or a police.
('98', 124, 1, 17, 266228) Why was it necessary to impose controls?
('98', 124, 1, 18, 266269) The controls became necessary because of the fear of dishonesty and profiteering on the part of the traders.
('98', 124, 1, 19, 266378) Why should a trader get more for his labour than a labourer gets for his?
('98', 124, 1, 20, 266452) He should not take more.
('98', 124, 1, 21, 266477) If the traders realize this we shall not have the difficulties which we are facing today in the matter of food and clothing.
('98', 124, 1, 22, 266602) If we all refuse to put up with controls, they will have to go.
('98', 124, 1, 23, 266666) If you and I are honest these controls cannot remain.
('98', 124, 1, 24, 266720) But if we are not honest, removal of controls will kill India.
('98', 124, 1, 25, 266783) The traders’ associations and mill owners should meet each other and remove the suspicion which people have against them and thus strengthen each other’s hands.
('98', 124, 1, 26, 266944) The Gita says: “Cherish the gods thus and let the gods cherish you.’’ 1 The gods are not to be found up in the sky.
('98', 124, 1, 27, 267060) Just as our girls are regarded as goddesses so are we gods.
('98', 124, 1, 28, 267120) But it is good that no one calls himself a god.
('98', 124, 1, 29, 267168) That is man’s humility.
('98', 124, 1, 30, 267192) We should become and remain as pure as gods and live happily.
('98', 124, 1, 31, 267254) Then our poverty, starvation and nakedness will disappear.
('98', 124, 1, 32, 267313) As far as cloth especially is concerned people in the villages themselves can, indeed must, produce the cloth they require.
('98', 124, 1, 33, 267437) When our womenfolk begin spinning the yarn with their own pure hands, crores of rupees will go into the pockets of our villagers.
('98', 124, 1, 34, 267567) We should take up such pure business.
('98', 124, 1, 35, 267605) I consider myself a peasant, a Bhangi and a trader.
('98', 124, 1, 36, 267657) You should learn from me how to carry on an honest trade.
('98', 124, 1, 37, 267715) I know how to do business.
('98', 124, 1, 38, 267742) After all I have been a lawyer.
('98', 124, 1, 39, 267774) Is not legal practice a kind of trade?
('98', 124, 1, 40, 267813) Today when I serve others I am pursuing a trade.
('98', 124, 1, 41, 267862) Trade does not mean earn ing money anyhow.
('98', 124, 1, 42, 267905) If you want to get the controls removed for the sake of the people and not for your
('98', 125, 0, 1, 267989) 126 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 125, 1, 2, 268031) own, they will certainly go.
('98', 125, 1, 3, 268060) You have displayed the slogan that the prosperity and freedom of India lie in decontrol.
('98', 125, 1, 4, 268149) If that is true you have to be very honest and brave in your business dealings.
('98', 125, 1, 5, 268229) I have a letter which says that import of foreign cloth is on the increase in India.
('98', 125, 1, 6, 268314) It also says that our cloth is being exported.
('98', 125, 1, 7, 268361) In my opinion both these things are wrong.
('98', 125, 1, 8, 268404) You will next start saying that you will not marry Indian women but import women from outside.
('98', 125, 1, 9, 268499) What kind of trade will that be?
('98', 125, 1, 10, 268532) My mother is my mother.
('98', 125, 1, 11, 268556) Shall I choose for mother another woman more beautiful than she?
('98', 125, 1, 12, 268621) In the same way you should not get beautiful clothes from outside.
('98', 125, 1, 13, 268688) These days businessmen import cloth in order to make money.
('98', 125, 1, 14, 268748) But why should we import foreign cloth and export our cloth?
('98', 125, 1, 15, 268809) We should make do with whatever cloth we produce here.
('98', 125, 1, 16, 268864) We may export whatever remains after our need is fulfilled.
('98', 125, 1, 17, 268924) You may export mill cloth but only after we have produced the required quantity of khadi in the country.
('98', 125, 1, 18, 269029) Control on cloth should go but at the same time control on petrol, firewood and other things should also go.
('98', 125, 1, 19, 269138) Here you have a sign saying “Beware of the mill owners’ tricks”.
('98', 125, 1, 20, 269203) Then you have to beware of the traders’ tricks and my tricks also.
('98', 125, 1, 21, 269270) You will have to cut my throat if I deceive you or if I serve my interest in the name of service.
('98', 125, 1, 22, 269368) If the mill owners or businessmen serve their own interests, then you have to boycott them.

('98', 125, 5, 26, 269527) NEW DELHI, December 28, 1947
('98', 125, 6, 27, 269556) BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
('98', 125, 7, 28, 269578) Today I was at a meeting of cloth merchants 1, where they told me that cloth too should be decontrolled as so many other things had been.
('98', 125, 7, 29, 269716) I have no doubt that control on cloth should be lifted.
('98', 125, 7, 30, 269772) You will see from the papers what happened at the meeting.
('98', 125, 7, 31, 269831) One thing the traders told me was that, even without the control on cloth being lifted,
('98', 125, 8, 32, 269919) 1 Vide the preceding item.
('98', 126, 0, 1, 269946) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 127
('98', 126, 1, 2, 269993) the prices of cloth had begun to decline.
('98', 126, 1, 3, 270035) The reason, they say, is that now my voice is raised for decontrol and the Government listens to me, and hence it is expected that cloth will soon be decontrolled.
('98', 126, 1, 4, 270199) This has led to the hoarded cloth being brought out into the open market and so the prices have registered a decline.
('98', 126, 1, 5, 270317) The same was the case with sugar.
('98', 126, 1, 6, 270351) People tell me that wherever one goes one sees large stocks of sugar.
('98', 126, 1, 7, 270421) It is being sold at one rupee a seer.
('98', 126, 1, 8, 270459) I am told that people are even able to bargain and buy it for 15 as.
('98', 126, 1, 9, 270528) or even 14 as.
('98', 126, 1, 10, 270543) I am receiving telegrams from all quarters reporting much relief among people as a consequence of decontrol.
('98', 126, 1, 11, 270652) Blessings are showered on me for having brought about decontrol.
('98', 126, 1, 12, 270717) But it is not I who should be blessed, but the masses, for it is their voice that I have taken up.
('98', 126, 1, 13, 270816) And that is why my voice was heard, otherwise who would listen to me?
('98', 126, 1, 14, 270886) My own voice counts for nothing.
('98', 126, 1, 15, 270919) I say we should not treat Muslims as enemies.
('98', 126, 1, 16, 270965) But people turn away from me.
('98', 126, 1, 17, 270995) They say I am mad.
('98', 126, 1, 18, 271014) I must say that if the masses do not listen to me they will be doing harm to their dharma.
('98', 126, 1, 19, 271105) I say nothing improper.
('98', 126, 1, 20, 271129) Tulsidas says that compassion is the essence of religion.
('98', 126, 1, 21, 271187) You may say that Tulsidas was mad but no other book is as popular in the country as his Ramayana.
('98', 126, 1, 22, 271285) It is not only in Bihar or in Delhi where it is popular, it is read everywhere.
('98', 126, 1, 23, 271365) I only repeated what Tulsidas said.
('98', 126, 1, 24, 271401) Why then do they say that I am mad?
('98', 126, 1, 25, 271437) I don’t understand the control over firewood.
('98', 126, 1, 26, 271483) It is not something you can eat.
('98', 126, 1, 27, 271516) If it is freely available, will anyone eat it or burn it all up?
('98', 126, 1, 28, 271581) They will burn only as much as is necessary.
('98', 126, 1, 29, 271626) Why then should there be control over it?
('98', 126, 1, 30, 271668) I shall not be satisfied till control on firewood is lifted.
('98', 126, 1, 31, 271729) Today it has become so scarce that the poor suffer.
('98', 126, 1, 32, 271781) People ask me to press for decontrol of petrol also.
('98', 126, 1, 33, 271834) I must say that control over petrol should be lifted and the sooner the better.
('98', 126, 1, 34, 271914) We shall only gain thereby.
('98', 126, 1, 35, 271942) There will be more motor vehicles on the roads which will only be for the good of the masses.
('98', 126, 1, 36, 272036) Of course if there were more trains plying there would be no need for so much petrol.
('98', 126, 1, 37, 272122) But laying more railway lines involves expenditure running into crores.
('98', 126, 1, 38, 272194) We must make the best use of what we have.
('98', 126, 1, 39, 272237) We have for the present all the railways we need.
('98', 126, 1, 40, 272287) There are enough roads for going from one place to another.
('98', 126, 1, 41, 272347) Only there is no petrol.
('98', 126, 1, 42, 272372) What we need today is not rail transport but motor transport.
('98', 126, 1, 43, 272434) I am sure that if petrol is decontrolled motor transport will increase.
('98', 126, 1, 44, 272506) Lifting of controls is leading everywhere to lowering of prices.
('98', 126, 1, 45, 272571) No decontrolled article has
('98', 127, 0, 1, 272599) 128 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 127, 1, 2, 272641) shown a rise in price.
('98', 127, 1, 3, 272664) If this had not been so I would not be getting all these telegrams.
('98', 127, 1, 4, 272732) Decontrol of petrol and increase in road transport will facilitate the movement of food and cloth in the country.
('98', 127, 1, 5, 272846) Salt too will be more easily available.
('98', 127, 1, 6, 272886) It is the price of salt that needs to be cut down the most.
('98', 127, 1, 7, 272946) The tax on salt has been withdrawn, but the price of salt has increased, which is wrong.
('98', 127, 1, 8, 273035) We have not learnt to make salt.
('98', 127, 1, 9, 273068) We have a vast sea coast and we should have no shortage of salt.
('98', 127, 1, 10, 273133) Even a child can make salt out of sea water.
('98', 127, 1, 11, 273178) If I bring a little sea water from the Bay of Bengal, I can easily convert it into salt.
('98', 127, 1, 12, 273267) It is a pity that one has to pay so much for this commodity and take so much trouble.
('98', 127, 1, 13, 273353) The reason is that salt is not being easily transported from where it is manufactured.
('98', 127, 1, 14, 273440) I know a mistake has been made in this regard in appointing contractors to transport salt.
('98', 127, 1, 15, 273531) They have become dishonest and are making a lot of money.
('98', 127, 1, 16, 273589) Others cannot transport salt.
('98', 127, 1, 17, 273619) This contract system should be changed and the control over salt should be lifted.
('98', 127, 1, 18, 273702) Two things are important, the change in the contract system and the organization of road transport.
('98', 127, 1, 19, 273802) That will do for today.

('98', 127, 5, 24, 273923) Compost is matter well placed, whereas rubbish and excreta, solid and liquid, are matter misplaced when they are allowed to lie anyhow to the discomfort of the public and detriment to their health.
('98', 127, 5, 25, 274121) It is a criminal waste depriving mother earth of her precious food.
('98', 127, 5, 26, 274189) Thus says Shrimati Mirabehn in her leaflet reproduced in full 1 in the Harijan, 23 11 ’47, pp.
('98', 127, 6, 27, 274284) We do not treat our Mother Earth properly.
('98', 127, 6, 28, 274327) She does her best to feed us all, but we do not feed her in return.
('98', 127, 6, 29, 274395) How can she sustain us, her children, if we do not serve her as dutiful children should serve a revered mother?
('98', 127, 6, 30, 274507) Year after year we plough, sow and reap harvests from the fields, but very rarely do we give any manure to the soil, and even what we give is usually half kachcha 2
('98', 127, 7, 31, 274672) rubbish.
('98', 127, 7, 32, 274681) Just as we need well cooked food, so does the soil need well prepared

('98', 128, 5, 6, 275005) 120. “DHAN” OF DUST
('98', 128, 6, 7, 275025) I could have given the heading “Dhan from Dust”.
('98', 128, 6, 8, 275074) But I have chosen “Dhan of Dust”.
('98', 128, 6, 9, 275108) The process of sifting the grains from dust means obtaining dhan from dust.
('98', 128, 6, 10, 275184) Similarly the industrious people of China collect gold dust by washing mud or sand.
('98', 128, 6, 11, 275268) This too I would call dhan from dust.
('98', 128, 6, 12, 275306) This is a transformation of the dust and much more so of the grains.
('98', 128, 6, 13, 275375) Normally we use the term dhan for foodgrain.
('98', 128, 6, 14, 275420) But when we use the word dhan for the grains of gold in dust, is it not a great transformation?
('98', 128, 6, 15, 275516) Here dhan means some useful object whose value can be determined.
('98', 128, 6, 16, 275582) But when we say “wealth of dust” it implies a chemical transformation of dust.
('98', 128, 6, 17, 275661) For instance, when we convert the dust, that is, earth into grains, we have converted the dust into wealth.
('98', 128, 6, 18, 275769) When we sow the seeds in the earth and water them properly, it produces grain.
('98', 128, 6, 19, 275848) I would call this creating dhan from dust.
('98', 128, 6, 20, 275891) Our language has not become precise because we have neglected it.
('98', 128, 6, 21, 275957) Let me now come to the main point.
('98', 128, 6, 22, 275992) I consider “compost” dhan of dust.
('98', 128, 6, 23, 276027) Compost means the gold like manure made from a proper mixture of such matter as cow dung, faeces, droppings of birds and animals, grass, chaff, refuse, urine, etc.
('98', 128, 6, 24, 276191) If we mix such manure with the earth in the field and then sow the seeds, it will yield at least double the crop and yet the soil will not lose its fertility.
('98', 128, 6, 25, 276350) Mirabehn is working hard in this direction.
('98', 128, 6, 26, 276394) She has set up an ashram at Rishikesh.
('98', 128, 6, 27, 276433) There she expects to carry on the work which she had begun in Delhi.
('98', 128, 6, 28, 276502) She has started issuing small pamphlets on this subject.
('98', 128, 6, 29, 276559) These pamphlets can be obtained from her.
('98', 128, 6, 30, 276601) Her pamphlet is published in Urdu.
('98', 128, 6, 31, 276636) She writes it in English as she does not have

('98', 129, 4, 6, 276993) 121. “URDU HARIJAN”
('98', 129, 5, 7, 277013) Readers know that two editions of Harijan in identical language are brought out every week—one in the Devanagari script and the other in the Urdu script.
('98', 129, 5, 8, 277167) One which is printed in the Urdu script is called the Urdu Harijan.
('98', 129, 5, 9, 277235) Shri Jivanji writes about its steadily dwindling circulation.
('98', 129, 6, 10, 277297) I have always been of the opinion that no newspaper should be published at a loss.
('98', 129, 6, 11, 277380) People should subscribe to the paper they want.
('98', 129, 6, 12, 277428) I do not regard a journal self supporting which meets its expenses out of advertisements.
('98', 129, 6, 13, 277518) I allowed the Urdu edition to continue at a loss so long only because Harijan on the whole with all its language editions did not incur any loss.
('98', 129, 6, 14, 277664) However there should be a limit to that also.
('98', 129, 6, 15, 277710) My views on Hindustani and the two scripts remain unchanged.
('98', 129, 6, 16, 277771) So for some time the Urdu edition will come out as usual.
('98', 129, 6, 17, 277829) In the mean time the readers of the Gujarati edition and others should decide whether they would like to have the Urdu edition.
('98', 129, 6, 18, 277957) If they want it they should help to enrol subscribers till the circulation reaches at least two thousand.
('98', 129, 6, 19, 278063) Along with this they should also give thought to another point.
('98', 129, 6, 20, 278127) It will become my duty to close down the Devanagari Harijan 2
('98', 129, 7, 21, 278189) also if people show an aversion to the Urdu script and the Urdu edition has to be stopped.
('98', 129, 7, 22, 278280) I do not consider it right to bring out Harijan exclusively in the Devanagari.
('98', 129, 7, 23, 278359) As a reformer it is my duty to bring out the paper either in both the scripts or in neither.
('98', 129, 7, 24, 278452) Much has been written on why the language is called “Hindustani” and not “Hindi” and why it should be written in both the Devanagari and Urdu scripts.
('98', 129, 7, 25, 278603) I cannot think of any new arguments.
('98', 129, 7, 26, 278640) My intention in writing this is to discuss how the Harijan
('98', 129, 8, 27, 278699) 1 The letter is not reproduced here.
('98', 129, 8, 28, 278736) Jivanji Desai had stated that the circulation of the Urdu Harijan had fallen to 250 copies from 1,800 copies and that it was running at a loss of Rs. 20,000 per year.

('98', 130, 6, 11, 279323) If death comes in the course of your mission of non violence, you will embrace it.
('98', 130, 6, 12, 279406) If they throw you into prison, you may fast unto death.
('98', 130, 6, 13, 279462) Those who have this strength may stay on in Noakhali and face death, undeterred by what may befall the women.
('98', 130, 6, 14, 279572) One ought not to run away in fear.

('98', 131, 12, 19, 281149) Through advertisements of drugs making false claims, people are made to pay at times even with their lives.

('98', 132, 2, 3, 281582) NEW DELHI, December 29, 1947
('98', 132, 3, 4, 281611) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, Yesterday was the death anniversary of Hakim Ajmal Khan.
('98', 132, 3, 5, 281690) Hakim Ajmal Khan belonged to all—Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Parsis and Jews.
('98', 132, 3, 6, 281769) He was a devout Muslim.
('98', 132, 3, 7, 281793) But he served everyone with equal devotion.
('98', 132, 3, 8, 281837) The finest memorial to his labours was the famous Tibbia College and hospital at Delhi.
('98', 132, 3, 9, 281925) All classes of students studied unani, ayurvedic and allopathic systems of medicine there.
('98', 132, 3, 10, 282016) The communal poison, for which there was no place in this institution, has forced it to close down.
('98', 132, 3, 11, 282116) I think the sole reason for this is that its founder Hakim Ajmal Khan was a Muslim, however good and however respected.
('98', 132, 3, 12, 282236) If the memory of that great patriot cannot bury the communal strife let it at least give a new life to this college.
('98', 132, 3, 13, 282353) I mentioned earlier that it would be good to have our meetings in the open air under the canopy of the sky.
('98', 132, 3, 14, 282461) If the habit grows we will have to make suitable arrangements for the site, etc., accordingly.
('98', 132, 3, 15, 282556) In towns big and small we will have to have open space for the purpose.
('98', 132, 3, 16, 282628) We will have to change our habits.
('98', 132, 3, 17, 282663) We will have to learn to be quiet rather than noisy and we will have to learn to sit in an orderly way.
('98', 132, 3, 18, 282767) We must learn also to speak only when we must and at a pitch that is sufficient for the occasion, neither too high nor too low.
('98', 132, 3, 19, 282895) We should respect the right of our neighbour and not come in the way of others, individually or in groups.
('98', 132, 3, 20, 283002) We should not interfere with other people’s business.
('98', 132, 3, 21, 283056) This will require on many occasions extreme self restraint.
('98', 132, 3, 22, 283116) In such an order of things the dirt and noise we find in the busiest areas of Delhi will no longer be there and however large the crowds there will be no pushing and jostling and no confusion.
('98', 132, 3, 23, 283309) We must not think that we can never reach that goal.
('98', 132, 3, 24, 283362) Some group or other will have to take the initiative and work for this sincerely.
('98', 132, 3, 25, 283444) Just think how much saving it will mean in energy and expenditure.
('98', 132, 3, 26, 283511) I have been severely reprimanded for what I said concerning Kashmir and its Maharaja 2. It seems to me that those who upbraid me have not really read attentively what I said.
('98', 132, 3, 27, 283686) The advice I gave is the

('98', 133, 0, 1, 283845) 134 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 133, 1, 2, 283887) kind of advice the humblest man may give.
('98', 133, 1, 3, 283929) Occasionally it becomes one’s duty to offer such advice.
('98', 133, 1, 4, 283986) If the Maharaja had acted on my advice he would have risen very high in his own eyes and in the eyes of the world.
('98', 133, 1, 5, 284101) Today his own plight and the plight of his State are not enviable.
('98', 133, 1, 6, 284168) Kashmir is a Hindu State, the majority of its people being Muslims.
('98', 133, 1, 7, 284236) The raiders called their raids a jihad.
('98', 133, 1, 8, 284276) They say that the Muslims of Kashmir are being ground down under the tyranny of Hindu raj and that they have come for their succour.
('98', 133, 1, 9, 284409) The Maharaja has invited Sheikh Abdullah at just the right time.
('98', 133, 1, 10, 284474) The task is new for Sheikh Abdullah.
('98', 133, 1, 11, 284511) But if the Maharaja thinks the Sheikh can shoulder the burden he should be encouraged in every way.
('98', 133, 1, 12, 284611) It seems obvious to me, as it should seem obvious to others outside, that if Sheikh Abdullah cannot carry with him the minority as well as the majority, Kashmir cannot be saved by military might alone.
('98', 133, 1, 13, 284813) Both the Maharaja and the Sheikh asked India for armed assistance.
('98', 133, 1, 14, 284880) My advice to the Maharaja is that he should be a constitutional sovereign like the King of England and run his government and use the Dogra army 1 according to the advice of Sheikh Abdullah and his Interim Cabinet.
('98', 133, 1, 15, 285095) What is there so strange about this?
('98', 133, 1, 16, 285132) The terms of the State’s accession to the Union remain as before.
('98', 133, 1, 17, 285198) They confer certain rights on the rulers.
('98', 133, 1, 18, 285240) I have ventured to advise the Maharaja that he should voluntarily relinquish or limit these rights and play his constitutional role as a Hindu ruler.
('98', 133, 1, 19, 285390) If the reports I get are inaccurate they should be put right.
('98', 133, 1, 20, 285452) If my views regarding Hinduism and the duties of a Hindu ruler are erroneous, there is no question of any weight being given to my advice.
('98', 133, 1, 21, 285591) If the Sheikh as the Chief of the Emergency Administration or as a true Muslim is found wanting in doing his duty he should remove himself from the scene and hand over the reins of administration to a better man.
('98', 133, 1, 22, 285804) Today Hinduism and Islam are being tested on the soil of Kashmir.
('98', 133, 1, 23, 285870) If the right thing is done and the right direction given to the process the chief actors will win fame.
('98', 133, 1, 24, 285974) It is my prayer that in the present darkness in the country Kashmir may become the star that provides light.
('98', 133, 1, 25, 286083) So much for the Maharaja and Sheikh Saheb.
('98', 133, 1, 26, 286126) Will not the Governments of Pakistan and the Union come together and decide the issue with the help of impartial Indians?
('98', 133, 1, 27, 286248) Is there no one in India who

('98', 134, 1, 2, 286361) is impartial?
('98', 134, 1, 3, 286375) I am sure we have not become bankrupt to that extent.
('98', 134, 1, 4, 286429) A lady from Mathura has sent Rs. 50 by M. O. for buying blankets for the refugees.
('98', 134, 1, 5, 286512) She does not disclose her name even to me.
('98', 134, 1, 6, 286555) She wants me to acknowledge receipt in my prayer speech.
('98', 134, 1, 7, 286612) I accordingly do so.
('98', 134, 1, 8, 286633) It is surprising that people of the States whose rulers have expressed a desire to accede to India are sending me telegrams full of complaints.
('98', 134, 1, 9, 286777) If a raja or a jagirdar feels that he cannot carry on the administration all by himself, who can force him to keep his State as a separate entity?
('98', 134, 1, 10, 286924) Those who spend money on these telegrams would be better advised to save their money.
('98', 134, 1, 11, 287010) It seems to me those behind these telegrams have some axe to grind.
('98', 134, 1, 12, 287078) They should go to the Home Secretary for advice.
('98', 134, 1, 13, 287127) Several Muslims especially in the Post and Telegraph Department say that they had earlier declared their willingness to stay in the Union for propaganda purposes and that they now want to change their option.
('98', 134, 1, 14, 287336) There are also Muslims who have been dismissed from service.
('98', 134, 1, 15, 287397) I think the reason for this can only be that they are suspected of being anti Hindu.
('98', 134, 1, 16, 287482) I sympathize with them.
('98', 134, 1, 17, 287506) But I feel that however unjustified the suspicion may be in individual instances it should be forgiven and they should not give way to anger.
('98', 134, 1, 18, 287648) I can only offer my well tried prescription.
('98', 134, 1, 19, 287693) Very few people can get into Government jobs.
('98', 134, 1, 20, 287739) It should never be one’s aim in life to secure a Government job.
('98', 134, 1, 21, 287804) One’s aim in life should only be to live honestly.
('98', 134, 1, 22, 287855) If a man is willing to use his hands he will always find scope to make an honest living.
('98', 134, 1, 23, 287944) I think that if Muslims want to retain their self respect they should not run after Government jobs to the extent of going to Pakistan for them.
('98', 134, 1, 24, 288089) Power comes from true service.
('98', 134, 1, 25, 288120) Often power becomes a cause for one’s downfall.
('98', 134, 1, 26, 288168) To fight for it is unseemly.
('98', 134, 1, 27, 288197) At the same time it is the duty of the Government to create opportunities of employment for the large number of unemployed men and women.
('98', 134, 1, 28, 288335) If the task is handled with skill it can bring benefits to the Government instead of being a strain.
('98', 134, 1, 29, 288436) I assume here that those for whom work has to be found will be of sound health and will be willing workers, not shirkers.

('98', 139, 1, 2, 293900) of the people with the minimum of controls.
('98', 139, 1, 3, 293944) The test of autocracy, socialism, capitalism, etc., is also people’s welfare or good govern ment.
('98', 139, 1, 4, 294042) In themselves they are of no value.
('98', 139, 1, 5, 294078) Any system of government can fail if people do not have honesty and a feeling of brotherhood.
('98', 139, 1, 6, 294172) There may be work, there may be men to do the work and tools with which to do it, yet in my view a system that admits of poverty and unemployment is not fit to survive even for a day.
('98', 139, 1, 7, 294356) How are you all?

('98', 139, 1, 12, 294489) This girl has learnt much but she neglects her health.
('98', 139, 1, 13, 294544) Unless she has high fever she goes on working.
('98', 139, 1, 14, 294591) She inflicts much brutality and violence on her body.
('98', 139, 1, 15, 294645) Doctors suspect typhoid.

('98', 139, 7, 24, 294883) NEW DELHI, December 30, 1947
('98', 139, 8, 25, 294912) BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
('98', 139, 9, 26, 294934) I told you yesterday in my written message and I also mentioned earlier that we should all know our respective places.
('98', 139, 9, 27, 295053) We must know when to speak and when to keep silent and how to conduct ourselves, so that even if millions are there there should be no disturbance and no feeling of crowding.
('98', 139, 9, 28, 295228) This is what happens with armies.
('98', 139, 9, 29, 295262) They maintain an external discipline.
('98', 139, 9, 30, 295300) What happens internally is another matter.
('98', 139, 9, 31, 295343) We have not had this kind of training.
('98', 139, 9, 32, 295382) I have often noticed that, when after the prayer I rise to go, people want to take a peep at me from all around and crowd round me.
('98', 139, 9, 33, 295514) Good manners demand that after the prayer meeting is over everyone should quietly remove himself.
('98', 139, 9, 34, 295612) Each one should ponder on whatever good things I may have said and go home.
('98', 140, 0, 1, 295688) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 141
('98', 140, 1, 2, 295735) I have a letter from Bahawalpur.
('98', 140, 1, 3, 295768) I once spoke about Bahawalpur to you.
('98', 140, 1, 4, 295806) 1 The people there liked what I said.
('98', 140, 1, 5, 295844) They want me to mention the matter again and repeat that all the Hindus and Sikhs who are still there and who want to leave the place should be allowed to do so.
('98', 140, 1, 6, 296006) All those who want to come have not been able to come.
('98', 140, 1, 7, 296061) There are still a large number of people there.
('98', 140, 1, 8, 296109) They want that no obstacle should be placed in their way and they should not be subjected to any assaults.
('98', 140, 1, 9, 296216) Whether my saying anything on the subject will have any effect God alone knows.
('98', 140, 1, 10, 296296) But one must make an effort whatever the effectiveness of one’s effort might be.
('98', 140, 1, 11, 296377) Of course the Nawab has said that Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs are equal in his eyes.
('98', 140, 1, 12, 296460) And he is equally interested in the welfare of all his subjects.
('98', 140, 1, 13, 296525) When he says so, who am I to question his motives?
('98', 140, 1, 14, 296576) Still I can plead with him and his officials that those Hindus and Sikhs who do not want to stay there should be allowed to leave.
('98', 140, 1, 15, 296707) It is his duty to put them on a train and have them safely escorted to the border.
('98', 140, 1, 16, 296790) But even if he cannot do so he can at any rate allow them to leave on their own, taking away such of their property as they can.
('98', 140, 1, 17, 296919) It will be a matter of thankfulness if he can do this much.
('98', 140, 1, 18, 296979) But I do not want to limit myself to only making a plea to the Nawab.
('98', 140, 1, 19, 297049) I want to tell Qaid e Azam Jinnah and his Government that today it has become impossible for a Hindu or any non Muslim to live peaceably in Sind.
('98', 140, 1, 20, 297195) Those Hindus who are called untouchables are particularly harassed there and they have no means of livelihood.
('98', 140, 1, 21, 297306) They at least should not be subjected to indignities.
('98', 140, 1, 22, 297360) Those who are not happy living there should be allowed to leave.
('98', 140, 1, 23, 297425) If their conditions of life are made easy even those who have left Sind will go back there, seeing that Sind has regained its former state.
('98', 140, 1, 24, 297565) But at present that is not the case.
('98', 140, 1, 25, 297602) Even their schools have been taken over for the use of refugees who have gone there from Kathiawar.
('98', 140, 1, 26, 297702) They say that the needs of the refugees are the first priority.
('98', 140, 1, 27, 297766) How can Hindus live in Sind under such conditions?
('98', 140, 1, 28, 297817) It will only mean that Pakistan has become Islamistan where no non Muslim may live or where he can live only as a slave.
('98', 140, 1, 29, 297938) I think no one will like to be a slave.
('98', 140, 1, 30, 297978) This sort of thing is in no one’s interest.
('98', 140, 1, 31, 298022) I have many other things to say and only fifteen minutes to say them.

('98', 141, 0, 1, 298139) 142 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 141, 1, 2, 298181) I had spoken to you about Pandharpur.
('98', 141, 1, 3, 298219) 1 There is a temple there of Lord Vithoba.
('98', 141, 1, 4, 298262) It is the largest temple in Maharashtra.
('98', 141, 1, 5, 298303) I have visited it.
('98', 141, 1, 6, 298322) I had suggested that it should be opened to Harijans.
('98', 141, 1, 7, 298376) Afterwards the trustees of the temple also supported my demand.
('98', 141, 1, 8, 298440) When I got the news that the temple had been opened to the Harijans I had told you of it.
('98', 141, 1, 9, 298530) Everyone seemed content and no voice was raised in opposition.
('98', 141, 1, 10, 298593) Now they say that a large number of Brahmin priests are unhappy over this because the temple is visited by many Harijans every day.
('98', 141, 1, 11, 298725) Some of the priests seem to have gone on a fast.
('98', 141, 1, 12, 298774) This has distressed me.
('98', 141, 1, 13, 298798) I have received this wire only today, and since I cannot reach there in any other way I think I should make a mention of the matter here and maybe my voice will reach Pandharpur.
('98', 141, 1, 14, 298977) I want to say in all humility and sincerity that those who have resorted to the fast and still call themselves priests are really not priests.
('98', 141, 1, 15, 299120) They are serving neither themselves nor Hinduism.
('98', 141, 1, 16, 299170) The image in the temple is the image of Vithoba, i.
('98', 141, 1, 17, 299222) e., of Krishna or Vishnu.
('98', 141, 1, 18, 299248) It could not be the will of Vishnu that some should have His glimpse and others may not.
('98', 141, 1, 19, 299337) In my view as long as the Harijans were barred from the temple it had not been really consecrated.
('98', 141, 1, 20, 299436) Why should these people now fast?
('98', 141, 1, 21, 299470) A Bill has been passed concerning Harijans’ entry into temples.
('98', 141, 1, 22, 299534) Even the lawmakers are Hindus.
('98', 141, 1, 23, 299565) When millions of Hindus say that the temple should be opened to Harijans, how can they say that it should remain closed?
('98', 141, 1, 24, 299686) I see no merit in the fast.
('98', 141, 1, 25, 299714) I think it is sinful and should be given up.
('98', 141, 1, 26, 299759) I think the priests should relent and say they were mistaken and their eyes have now been opened.
('98', 141, 1, 27, 299857) It cannot be that in the temple of God one man should be admitted and another kept out.
('98', 141, 1, 28, 299945) It is believed that visiting a temple cleanses the sinner of his sins in the same way as bathing in the Ganga does.
('98', 141, 1, 29, 300061) I personally do not support the view that the water from the Ganga washes away the sins but it is a belief widely held.
('98', 141, 1, 30, 300181) And maybe it does good to one who bathes in the Ganga in the faith that his sins will be washed away.
('98', 141, 1, 31, 300283) Besides who can say that Harijans are all sinners?
('98', 141, 1, 32, 300334) There are among Harijans persons of great merit as well as sinners.
('98', 141, 1, 33, 300402) A complaint has been sent to me pertaining to Bombay.
('98', 141, 1, 34, 300456) It may be true of other places too.
('98', 141, 1, 35, 300492) The complaint is that very little rice is supplied to card holders in Bombay, perhaps half a seer in a week.
('98', 141, 1, 36, 300601) This is wholly inadequate and will encourage black marketing.
('98', 141, 1, 37, 300663) I will say that control should go.

('98', 142, 5, 9, 301079) Friends have more than once asked me why I have not noticed the death of so great a patriot as Tatyasaheb Kelkar 1, especially because he was a political opponent and more so because I am much misunderstood among a school of Maharashtrians.
('98', 142, 5, 10, 301320) These reasons made no appeal to me: the very reasons which according to my critics should have prompted my notice.
('98', 142, 5, 11, 301435) I conceive it to be very unseemly to notice pro forma such a serious event as death.
('98', 142, 5, 12, 301520) But I must do so now, though it is late, because of the importunity of one of my oldest friends— Haribhau Phatak.
('98', 142, 5, 13, 301634) I would at once admit that if it was usual for the Harijan to notice important deaths and births then Tatyasaheb’s death should be among the first to merit notice.
('98', 142, 5, 14, 301798) But industrious readers will have noticed that the Harijan has not followed any such practice.
('98', 142, 5, 15, 301893) Notice has depended upon my whim of the moment and leisure.
('98', 142, 5, 16, 301953) For some time past I have been unable to read newspapers regularly.
('98', 142, 5, 17, 302021) Whatever may be said to the contrary, Tatyasaheb, though a political opponent, I had always counted as a friend whose criticism was profitable.
('98', 142, 5, 18, 302165) I knew and honoured him as the late Lokamanya’s 2

('98', 142, 6, 20, 302232) It was, I fancy, in 1919 that I pleaded at an A. I. C. C. meeting for a constitution for the Congress 3 and said that if the

Kelkar, I. B. Sen, A. Rangaswami Iyengar and Vithalbhai Patel to consider the constitution of the Congress.

('98', 143, 2, 3, 303157) Sen, I would undertake to draw up one for submission to the Congress.
('98', 143, 2, 4, 303227) Be it said to the credit of both the collaborators that though I submitted my draft to them in time, they never interfered with it.
('98', 143, 2, 5, 303359) At the Committee that sat to consider the draft Tatyasaheb always offered helpful criticism.
('98', 143, 2, 6, 303452) It was again at my suggestion that he was invariably appointed a member of the Working Committee.
('98', 143, 2, 7, 303550) I do not remember an occasion when his criticism though sometimes bitter was not constructive.
('98', 143, 2, 8, 303645) He was fearless but polite and friendly.
('98', 143, 2, 9, 303686) I had early learnt that he was a scholarly writer of Marathi.
('98', 143, 2, 10, 303748) It has been my regret that I never got the time to learn Marathi sufficiently to drink deep of the wisdom of the modern Marathi writers like Tatyasaheb and the late Hari Narayan Apte.
('98', 143, 2, 11, 303932) It would be churlish on my part to ignore the death of so great a star like Shri Narasopant Chintaman Kelkar in the Indian firmament.

('98', 143, 8, 19, 304255) I had tried bhilama 3 under the supervision of a vaidya of Poona named Joshi, after my release from jail.

('98', 146, 4, 16, 308905) I do not care if only half a dozen of you go.
('98', 146, 4, 17, 308951) If there is simplicity, sincerity and purity within and without, your work will flourish.
('98', 146, 4, 18, 309041) After doing full justice to your overloaded breakfast tables in your spacious bungalows you alight from posh cars dangling your stylish vanity bags, while those you are supposed to serve cannot even afford the luxury of a bath for lack of a change of clothes.
('98', 146, 4, 19, 309301) Do you ever care to think that you are going to see people who had to leave behind properties worth thousands?
('98', 146, 4, 20, 309412) Social service these days has become a means for getting on in the world.
('98', 146, 4, 21, 309486) Many socialites have consequently taken to this profitable hobby.
('98', 146, 4, 22, 309552) There are of course exceptions but they are few and far between.
('98', 146, 4, 23, 309617) I want women workers who would set an example in self help, simplicity and dignity of labour.

('98', 147, 1, 2, 310224) Muslims.
('98', 147, 1, 3, 310233) They should be received with open arms and given the same place which they occupied before in society.
('98', 147, 1, 4, 310336) The saintly poet Tulsidas once said: “Compassion is the root of religion.” If we do not show regard to those sisters of ours, we cease to have any religion at all.

('98', 147, 4, 7, 310550) NEW DELHI, December 31, 1947
('98', 147, 5, 8, 310579) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, Here are a few questions.
('98', 147, 5, 9, 310627) Let me see how many of them I can deal with.
('98', 147, 5, 10, 310672) A friend writes to ask how, when Hindus and Sikhs cannot live peacefully in Sind, the Hindus from Punjab can be asked to go back.
('98', 147, 5, 11, 310802) Has there been some significant change of heart?
('98', 147, 5, 12, 310851) I think the Correspondent could not have asked the question if he had known the whole situation.
('98', 147, 5, 13, 310948) What I had told the Punjab Hindus was after a meeting I had with some Muslim friends.
('98', 147, 5, 14, 311034) 1 I cannot yet definitely advise the Punjab refugees to go back.
('98', 147, 5, 15, 311099) It is right that so long as Hindus and Sikhs cannot live happily in Sind I cannot have any hopes as regards the Punjab either.
('98', 147, 5, 16, 311226) At present the complaints I am receiving from all sides seem to be as to why Hindus and Sikhs from.
('98', 147, 5, 17, 311326) Other places in Pakistan are not being allowed to come.
('98', 147, 5, 18, 311382) A few men from Chitral and Swat came to see me.
('98', 147, 5, 19, 311430) They say there are still 251 Hindus in those places.
('98', 147, 5, 20, 311483) I said that this was not a very large number.
('98', 147, 5, 21, 311529) In Sind there are Hindus and Sikhs in much greater numbers and when they cannot come how can you expect the few in Swat and Chitral to be allowed to leave?
('98', 147, 5, 22, 311685) The Government is doing what it can and so long as all the Hindus and Sikhs stranded in Pakistan do not arrive here it will not rest.
('98', 147, 5, 23, 311819) I shall therefore not speak of the refugees returning to Pakistan till there is a change of heart.
('98', 147, 5, 24, 311918) I know that if there is a change of heart in one place the same thing will happen at other places.
('98', 147, 5, 25, 312017) If we have a change of heart here there will be a change of heart in Pakistan.
('98', 147, 5, 26, 312096) It will take some effort no doubt but there will be a change.
('98', 147, 5, 27, 312158) After all madness seized us only after it had

('98', 148, 1, 2, 312298) seized people in Pakistan.
('98', 148, 1, 3, 312325) I shall not go into the various stages and degrees of madness.
('98', 148, 1, 4, 312388) If sanity does not return we shall lose both India and Pakistan.
('98', 148, 1, 5, 312453) There will be a war.
('98', 148, 1, 6, 312474) The present state cannot last.
('98', 148, 1, 7, 312505) People say that the required change in the situation has already taken place, that Hindus and Sikhs have come to India and Muslims from India have gone to Pakistan.
('98', 148, 1, 8, 312670) They point out that transfer of populations of such magnitude cannot be reversed.
('98', 148, 1, 9, 312752) I do not hold this view.
('98', 148, 1, 10, 312777) Even if I am the only one to say it I shall still say that so long as people do not go back to their homes there will be no peace in the two countries.
('98', 148, 1, 11, 312929) All the comforts you can provide to the Sikh and Hindu refugees are not going to heal the wounds they have suffered.
('98', 148, 1, 12, 313046) It will be a matter of perpetual distress to them that they have lost their hearths and homes and if there is a war in fifty years’ time or a hundred years’ time, they are going to remember this.
('98', 148, 1, 13, 313242) Such things are not forgotten.
('98', 148, 1, 14, 313273) A friend asks if the refugee camps cannot be made centres of training in handicrafts.
('98', 148, 1, 15, 313359) This is certainly possible if even a single refugee wants it.
('98', 148, 1, 16, 313421) It will not be necessary for me to bring any pressure on the Government to do this.
('98', 148, 1, 17, 313505) It will readily agree to do what will save them the enormous expenditure they incur at present in running these camps.
('98', 148, 1, 18, 313624) This will also enable the refugees to earn their livelihood without losing self respect.
('98', 148, 1, 19, 313713) I suggested that the friend should campaign for this and create an atmosphere where the refugees will themselves ask that they should be taught handicrafts.
('98', 148, 1, 20, 313870) This will raise India higher and arrest the rot that has set in in India.
('98', 148, 1, 21, 313944) A lady has just given me this note.
('98', 148, 1, 22, 313980) She is I think a Hindu from Pakistan.
('98', 148, 1, 23, 314018) She says she had gone out for a short period and when she returned she found the lock of her house broken and some Sikhs occupying the house.
('98', 148, 1, 24, 314160) She went to the police and had them arrested.
('98', 148, 1, 25, 314206) One of them escaped.
('98', 148, 1, 26, 314227) Now she wants to know what she should do— whether she should leave the house?
('98', 148, 1, 27, 314305) I would not advise her to leave.
('98', 148, 1, 28, 314338) I did not advise even those coming from Pakistan to leave their houses.
('98', 148, 1, 29, 314410) But what is my advice worth?
('98', 148, 1, 30, 314439) People will not be ready to lay down their lives on my saying so.
('98', 148, 1, 31, 314505) I shall advise the lady not to leave her house.
('98', 148, 1, 32, 314553) Why did the Sikh friends forcibly enter her house?
('98', 148, 1, 33, 314604) The refugees should declare that they will not force themselves on anyone, nor enter anyone’s house without permission.
('98', 148, 1, 34, 314724) They should live on what little money they get.
('98', 148, 1, 35, 314772) A lady has written to me a beautiful letter.
('98', 148, 1, 36, 314817) She does not give her name and address.
('98', 148, 1, 37, 314857) She says she listens to my speeches every day on the radio, but that the hymns and bhajans sung at the meeting are not relayed.
('98', 148, 1, 38, 314985) She suggests that if not every day at least once every third or
('98', 149, 0, 1, 315049) 150 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 149, 1, 2, 315091) fourth day the prayer should be broadcast; that my speeches are only of mundane significance, while prayers are something spiritual.
('98', 149, 1, 3, 315224) My speeches are recorded by the radio people and then relayed.
('98', 149, 1, 4, 315287) I have no hand in this.
('98', 149, 1, 5, 315311) Maybe they think that what I say will make for public good.
('98', 149, 1, 6, 315371) I do not know what is possible for the radio people to do.
('98', 149, 1, 7, 315430) But I think the bhajans sung here, however badly sung they may be, should be relayed.
('98', 149, 1, 8, 315516) I respect the sister for what she has written.
('98', 149, 1, 9, 315563) I must however disagree with her when she separates the prayer from the prayer speech.
('98', 149, 1, 10, 315650) I have told you that what I say after the prayer is part of the prayer.
('98', 149, 1, 11, 315722) I cannot sing it to you and my voice has no sweetness.
('98', 149, 1, 12, 315777) Besides, I have grown so old that I would not be able to sing even if I wanted.
('98', 149, 1, 13, 315857) So the girls sing and sing well.
('98', 149, 1, 14, 315890) Whatever therefore is said or sung here is a prayer addressed to God.
('98', 149, 1, 15, 315960) I should advise people to understand this.
('98', 149, 1, 16, 316003) Now about Junagadh and Ajmer.
('98', 149, 1, 17, 316033) I spoke to you about the telegrams from Junagadh.
('98', 149, 1, 18, 316083) Now I have a telegram about Ajmer.
('98', 149, 1, 19, 316118) I know the story concerning Ajmer.
('98', 149, 1, 20, 316153) What happened there was pretty grim.
('98', 149, 1, 21, 316190) But the telegram exaggerates it.
('98', 149, 1, 22, 316223) Such exaggeration only annoys people and provokes them.
('98', 149, 1, 23, 316279) There is already so much poison in Delhi; but to say that Muslim property there is being plundered and their houses burnt, and that the shrine is in danger, is not right.
('98', 149, 1, 24, 316450) The fact is that no one is going to touch the shrine.
('98', 149, 1, 25, 316504) Why then do they send me such telegrams?
('98', 149, 1, 26, 316545) There certainly have been instances of looting there.
('98', 149, 1, 27, 316599) There also have been cases of arson and killings too.
('98', 149, 1, 28, 316653) This is not to be denied.
('98', 149, 1, 29, 316679) But exaggerating it only makes it smaller.
('98', 149, 1, 30, 316722) I appeal to everyone to compare the report with the events.
('98', 149, 1, 31, 316782) Only then can we ensure the justice which we seek.
('98', 149, 1, 32, 316833) If we cannot confine ourselves to facts we are doomed.

('98', 149, 6, 38, 317013) No human being or religious institution is perfect in this imperfect world.

('98', 150, 1, 3, 317525) They in the past could at least plead in mitigation that they did not know what they were doing.
('98', 150, 1, 4, 317622) We can offer no such defence.
('98', 150, 1, 5, 317652) And as the Confucian saying goes, “To know what is right and not to do it is cowardice.” In theory, a perfect religion is possible.
('98', 150, 1, 6, 317784) But mankind has not known any so far just as no man can claim to have seen God.

('98', 150, 5, 12, 318187) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter of 11th November 2 which I have just received.
('98', 150, 5, 13, 318275) I have not seen the report you refer to.
('98', 150, 5, 14, 318316) In any case, whatever I have said does not refer in any way to the failure of ahimsa, but it refers to my failure to recognize, until it was too late, that what I had mistaken for ahimsa was not ahimsa, but passive resistance of the weak, which can never be called ahimsa even in the remotest sense.
('98', 150, 5, 15, 318616) The internecine feud that is going on today in India is the direct outcome of the energy that was set free during the thirty years’ action of the weak.
('98', 150, 5, 16, 318768) Hence, the proper way to view the present outburst of violence throughout the world is to recognize that the technique of unconquerable non violence of the strong has not been discovered as yet.
('98', 150, 5, 17, 318963) Not an ounce of non violent strength is ever wasted.
('98', 150, 5, 18, 319016) I must not, therefore, flatter myself with the belief nor allow friends like you to entertain the belief that I have exhibited any heroic and demonstrable non violence in myself as yet.
('98', 150, 5, 19, 319202) All I can claim is that I am sailing in that direction without a moment’s stoppage.

('98', 152, 15, 26, 321780) NEW DELHI, January 1, 1948
('98', 152, 16, 27, 321807) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, Today is New Year’s Day according to the English calendar.
('98', 152, 16, 28, 321888) I am happy to see such a large number of people gathered here.
('98', 152, 16, 29, 321951) I regret that it took no less than 7 minutes for us to make room for the women to sit.
('98', 152, 16, 30, 322038) Even one minute lost at such a meeting is hundreds of thousands of minutes lost to hundreds of thousands of people.
('98', 153, 0, 1, 322154) 154 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 153, 1, 2, 322196) brothers should learn to offer first place to the sisters.
('98', 153, 1, 3, 322255) The country where women are not honoured is not really civilized.
('98', 153, 1, 4, 322321) According to Manu 1 men and women should both understand their own limits.
('98', 153, 1, 5, 322396) We should learn to behave with added restraint now that we are free.
('98', 153, 1, 6, 322465) I hope the audience attending the prayer meetings will be even larger in future.
('98', 153, 1, 7, 322546) But all those that come should come with prayer in their hearts, for prayer is the food for the heart.
('98', 153, 1, 8, 322649) We cannot get anywhere else such food as we get from God.
('98', 153, 1, 9, 322707) I also hope that the audience will maintain silence and will return to their homes in silence.
('98', 153, 1, 10, 322802) Recently there was a Harijan conference in U. P., at which it is reported, a minister preached to the Harijans that they should give up their unclean habits, unclean living and unclean clothes and abstain from alcohol.
('98', 153, 1, 11, 323021) A Harijan countered that the Government could burn up the unclean clothes just as it could have palm trees cut down and wine shops closed.
('98', 153, 1, 12, 323160) I admire the courage of the Harijan friend.
('98', 153, 1, 13, 323204) I for one make gur from palm.
('98', 153, 1, 14, 323234) I shall advise the Harijan brethren that the cure is in their own hands.
('98', 153, 1, 15, 323307) Even if liquor is sold in shops they should keep away from it as they would from poison.
('98', 153, 1, 16, 323396) In fact liquor is worse than poison.
('98', 153, 1, 17, 323433) Labourers drink in order to forget their domestic worries.
('98', 153, 1, 18, 323492) Poison can only kill the body.
('98', 153, 1, 19, 323523) Liquor can kill even the soul.
('98', 153, 1, 20, 323554) One loses the ability to control one’s action.
('98', 153, 1, 21, 323601) I would advise the Government to close down liquor shops and to replace them by eating houses where people could get pure and light food.
('98', 153, 1, 22, 323739) Here they should distribute books from which people could learn something and they should provide to them some harmless entertainment.
('98', 153, 1, 23, 323874) But there should be no place for cinema.
('98', 153, 1, 24, 323915) This will help people to give up alcohol.
('98', 153, 1, 25, 323957) I say this from my experience of many countries.
('98', 153, 1, 26, 324006) I have seen this in India and I had seen it also in South Africa.
('98', 153, 1, 27, 324072) I am quite sure that giving up alcohol increases both the physical vigour of man and his capacity to earn.
('98', 153, 1, 28, 324179) It is for this reason that prohibition has been a part of the Congress programme since 1920. Now that we are free the Government should redeem its pledge and give up the unholy excise revenue.
('98', 153, 1, 29, 324372) It is not a real loss, for it will bring enormous good to the people.
('98', 153, 1, 30, 324442) This is the way to our prosperity.
('98', 153, 1, 31, 324477) We should achieve this through our own effort.

('98', 154, 3, 4, 324737) I didn’t see the pen at all.
('98', 154, 3, 5, 324766) I even inquired about it.
('98', 154, 3, 6, 324792) I you had told me, I would certainly have written.

('98', 154, 5, 9, 324958) 157. WANTED ACCURACY
('98', 154, 6, 10, 324979) A correspondent from Malabar writes: 3
('98', 154, 7, 11, 325018) The confidence with which Shri Dev Prakash Nayyar has written on the “Intellectual Content of the Takli” in the Harijan of 21 12 47, takes one’s breath away.
('98', 154, 7, 12, 325176) He has made out that all knowledge is contained in the takli or can be derived from it or it is the quintessence of knowledge....
('98', 154, 7, 13, 325306) No doubt, the takli, charkha and spinning have a place in the proper scheme of education, especially, Nayee Talim, but to Say that the takli naturally takes you to mathematics, physics, economics, etc.
('98', 154, 7, 14, 325508) is but “sentimental nonsense.” The takli enthusiasts need not carry their arguments in favour of spinning to a ridiculous extent.
('98', 154, 7, 15, 325638) The cause of spinning cannot be advanced that way.
('98', 154, 7, 16, 325689) The correspondent evidently has not read as carefully as necessary Shri Dev Prakash Nayyar’s contribution on the takli As I read it, he has advanced no such claim as the correspondent imagines.
('98', 154, 7, 17, 325883) The author has not said that “all knowledge is contained in” or that “it is derived from” the takli, nor has he said that it is “the quintessence of knowledge”.
('98', 154, 7, 18, 326044) His thesis simply is that much knowledge that we derive from the books can be better given by competent teachers through crafts.
('98', 154, 7, 19, 326173) The fact that the correspondent who is a practised spinner of long standing is “shocked” at Shri Dev Prakash Nayyar’s claim and calls it “sentimental nonsense” proves that education does not reside in the takli, but it does in an educationist who, like Shri Dev Prakask Nayyar, having tested the possibilities of the takli is entitled to make the claim above mentioned.
('98', 154, 7, 20, 326543) I fear I must deprive the correspondent of the smug satisfaction that not even I have attributed to the innocent looking takli more than “economic and moral virtues”.
('98', 154, 7, 21, 326710) Even the modest claim, I am sorry,
('98', 154, 8, 22, 326745) 1 This was scribbeled on a letter from Nrisimhaprasad K. Bhatt dated January 1. 2 ibid 3 Only extrctts from the letter are reproduced here.

('98', 155, 1, 2, 326927) claim, I am sorry, has not found universal acceptance.
('98', 155, 1, 3, 326982) I was probably the first in India to ascribe what may be termed extravagant virtue to the takli and the like.
('98', 155, 1, 4, 327092) Practical teachers along the line have found many more possibilities in handicrafts than I had mentioned.
('98', 155, 1, 5, 327198) All honour to them for it.
('98', 155, 1, 6, 327225) I would strongly advise the correspondent humbly to accept Shri Dev Prakash Nayyar’s cautious claim and seek more information from him as to how in the course of his giving his pupils lessons in Nayee Talim, he came upon his discovery.
('98', 155, 1, 7, 327461) If the discovery is only imaginary, the correspondent will soon find out to Shri Dev Prakash Nayyar’s discomfiture.
('98', 155, 1, 8, 327577) The fall of an apple from its branch is said to have enabled Newton’s rich mind to discover the law of gravitation.

('98', 156, 3, 4, 328557) The Gita rightly says that action without knowledge is of no worth.
('98', 156, 3, 5, 328625) I have had experience of this many times and many others too will have had the experience.
('98', 156, 3, 6, 328716) If action is informed by knowledge devotion comes on its own.
('98', 156, 3, 7, 328778) To do this one must always take one’s stand on truth.
('98', 156, 3, 8, 328832) If one has come to realize truth nothing else remains to be done.
('98', 156, 3, 9, 328898) As we look into a mirror and discover the lightest spots on our faces, so must we look into our hearts.
('98', 156, 3, 10, 329002) Only afterwards may we criticize others.
('98', 156, 3, 11, 329043) Hardly anyone can claim perfection for himself.
('98', 156, 3, 12, 329091) It is my humble advice to you that rather than observe the faults of .
('98', 156, 3, 13, 329162) you should observe your own....
('98', 156, 3, 14, 329194) should follow my advice only if he finds it good.

('98', 156, 7, 19, 329347) January 2, 1948
('98', 156, 8, 20, 329363) I find myself here in a fiery pit.
('98', 156, 8, 21, 329398) It is difficult to say what will happen.
('98', 156, 8, 22, 329439) Maybe we shall know soon.
('98', 156, 8, 23, 329465) Manu is completely exhausted.
('98', 156, 8, 24, 329495) Her condition has reached a stage where it causes worry.
('98', 156, 8, 25, 329552) The fault is perhaps as much mine as hers.
('98', 156, 8, 26, 329595) I have made her work eighteen hours at a stretch.
('98', 156, 8, 27, 329645) And I have subjected her to an equal or even greater mental strain.
('98', 156, 8, 28, 329713) After all she is only a young girl of sixteen or seventeen years.
('98', 156, 8, 29, 329779) Still I am convinced that if she only has Ramanama inscribed in her heart she will suffer no physical enfeeblement.
('98', 156, 8, 30, 329895) But how can I measure this?
('98', 156, 8, 31, 329923) So long as her condition does not improve it must remain a cause of worry to me.
('98', 156, 8, 32, 330004) In this yajna her part is of no small significance.
('98', 156, 8, 33, 330056) So many girls come to me.
('98', 156, 8, 34, 330082) But in the matter of service Manu, considering her age, surpasses all the others.
('98', 156, 8, 35, 330164) And if I had not sent for her, I would have carried the guilt of having done her injustice.
('98', 156, 8, 36, 330256) Now my only wish is to see her restored to health.
('98', 156, 8, 37, 330307) I cannot say how long I shall have to stay here.
('98', 156, 8, 38, 330356) I have to do or die.
('98', 156, 8, 39, 330377) There is no third way.
('98', 156, 8, 40, 330400) How is your health?

('98', 157, 6, 10, 330768) January 2, 1948
('98', 157, 7, 11, 330784) Man today is afraid of man, afraid of his neighbour.
('98', 157, 7, 12, 330837) How can I then talk about national issues?
('98', 157, 7, 13, 330880) We deliberately bring suffering on ourselves, deceive ourselves.
('98', 157, 7, 14, 330945) No one can harm another.
('98', 157, 7, 15, 330970) In my view man is himself the cause of his sufferings.
('98', 157, 7, 16, 331025) This city which is the metropolis of the country has the appearance of a dead city.
('98', 157, 7, 17, 331109) No one trusts anyone.
('98', 157, 7, 18, 331131) Such peace as one finds is to be attributed to the fear of the police.
('98', 157, 7, 19, 331202) Why is it that the freedom achieved through non violence is sought to be sustained by violence?
('98', 157, 7, 20, 331298) I have been searching my heart.
('98', 157, 7, 21, 331330) I find despair there.
('98', 157, 7, 22, 331352) Maybe it was the will of God that I should witness this day.
('98', 157, 7, 23, 331413) Now I have to do or die.
('98', 157, 7, 24, 331438) Let us see how much I have yet to overcome to reach the state of sthitaprajna.
('98', 157, 7, 25, 331517) I thank God that he woke me up at last.
('98', 157, 7, 26, 331557) Manu is seriously ill.
('98', 157, 7, 27, 331580) The girl has tremendous energy but she has become weak in the body.
('98', 157, 7, 28, 331648) I admit that I have treated her harshly and this is the result of that.
('98', 157, 7, 29, 331720) After all how much can her poor body bear?
('98', 157, 7, 30, 331763) I have extracted much physical work from her and even more mental work.
('98', 157, 7, 31, 331835) But I have the satisfaction that she has lost nothing.
('98', 157, 7, 32, 331890) I have trained her well.
('98', 157, 7, 33, 331915) If only I could bring her back to health now!
('98', 157, 7, 34, 331961) She is careless about her health.
('98', 157, 7, 35, 331995) She forgets everything in serving me.
('98', 157, 7, 36, 332033) You should not worry.
('98', 157, 7, 37, 332055) I am much concerned about her health.
('98', 157, 7, 38, 332093) Typhoid is suspected.
('98', 157, 7, 39, 332115) How are you all?

('98', 158, 2, 3, 332377) NEW DELHI, January 2, 1948
('98', 158, 3, 4, 332404) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, Tomorrow we may have to hold the prayer meeting at the Wavell Canteen, where many refugees are living.
('98', 158, 3, 5, 332529) I have been there once and I was asked then to hold the prayer meeting there, but I could not stay on.
('98', 158, 3, 6, 332632) Today someone from the camp came and requested me and I have agreed to go there tomorrow.
('98', 158, 3, 7, 332722) So if it does not rain tomorrow I shall hold the prayer there.
('98', 158, 3, 8, 332785) But if it rains it may not be possible to have the prayer there.
('98', 158, 3, 9, 332850) In that case we shall have it here.
('98', 158, 3, 10, 332886) In any case the prayer meeting will be held.
('98', 158, 3, 11, 332931) Thus it is a little uncertain about tomorrow.
('98', 158, 3, 12, 332977) Of course if you wish, you may come here and if there is no prayer, you can go back.
('98', 158, 3, 13, 333062) I saw you laugh at my little umbrella 1. It is a beautiful thing.
('98', 158, 3, 14, 333128) It costs nothing.
('98', 158, 3, 15, 333146) It was given to me free of cost not because I am a Mahatma.
('98', 158, 3, 16, 333206) The fact is that when I was touring in Noakhali, 2 it was very hot and some people took pity on me and gave me this.
('98', 158, 3, 17, 333323) They put it on also when it rains.
('98', 158, 3, 18, 333358) Mostly people have to work in the fields, they cannot do so in the heat of the sun without putting this on.
('98', 158, 3, 19, 333466) Muslims live there in large numbers.
('98', 158, 3, 20, 333503) There are Hindus too, but mostly they carry on business.
('98', 158, 3, 21, 333560) Everyone has this kind of umbrella.
('98', 158, 3, 22, 333596) There was a Muslim friend there because after all every Muslim did not consider me his enemy and later they had all understood that I had not gone there to plunder them or to prepare a case against them, but I had gone there only to give such solace as I could to the Hindus.
('98', 158, 3, 23, 333872) So they gave me this umbrella.
('98', 158, 3, 24, 333903) I did not really need it much there because I did not do more than an hour of walking each day.
('98', 158, 3, 25, 333999) They also gave one to Nirmal Babu 3. When I left Noakhali Manu suggested that I should take along this umbrella because I would have to do a lot of walking in the sun and it would be a good covering for the head.
('98', 158, 3, 26, 334212) This can be made anywhere.
('98', 158, 3, 27, 334239) It can be made even here.
('98', 158, 3, 28, 334265) The other kind of umbrella needs a handle while this has no handle.
('98', 158, 3, 29, 334333) When it is windy we can tie the string attached to it round the face.

('98', 159, 1, 3, 334749) In this bhajan we pray to God to wake up.
('98', 159, 1, 4, 334791) But God is always awake.
('98', 159, 1, 5, 334816) He never sleeps.
('98', 159, 1, 6, 334833) But there is a belief in Hinduism that when dawn breaks everyone must wake up.
('98', 159, 1, 7, 334912) The devout go round calling everyone to arise.
('98', 159, 1, 8, 334959) We have bhajans for the morning, bhajans for the noon, bhajans for the evening and bhajans for the night.
('98', 159, 1, 9, 335065) Only musicologists know all the subtle distinctions.
('98', 159, 1, 10, 335118) I do not know much but since some bhajan or other is sung here every day I have come to have some idea.
('98', 159, 1, 11, 335222) I have a long letter apparently written by a Hindu.
('98', 159, 1, 12, 335274) He says I have learnt nothing and am still friendly with Muslims, though I have been repeatedly told how stupid it is to imagine that any Muslim can be our brother or be loyal to the Indian Union.
('98', 159, 1, 13, 335471) If there are any such, he says, I should keep them and send the rest away.
('98', 159, 1, 14, 335546) If I did not do so, what would happen, he asks, in case, God forbid, a war broke out between India and Pakistan.
('98', 159, 1, 15, 335659) Do I imagine that the several crores of Muslims in India will be loyal to India and fight against Pakistan?
('98', 159, 1, 16, 335767) It is easy to pose such questions but difficult to answer them.
('98', 159, 1, 17, 335831) All that I can say is: Wherever we may choose to live, if we want to live as men we must not assume anyone to be bad till he has been proved to be bad.
('98', 159, 1, 18, 335983) If you read newspapers you will know that recently about one lakh of Muslims had gathered in Lucknow.
('98', 159, 1, 19, 336085) 1 One cannot believe that there was not a single Muslim Leaguer among them.
('98', 159, 1, 20, 336161) There must have been some, even if there had been no League leaders.
('98', 159, 1, 21, 336230) If later they betray you, you can shoot them.
('98', 159, 1, 22, 336276) You may shoot one or two or a certain number.
('98', 159, 1, 23, 336322) Everyone will not be disloyal.
('98', 159, 1, 24, 336353) Nowhere in the world can everyone be disloyal.
('98', 159, 1, 25, 336400) Therefore the correspondent writes out of ignorance.
('98', 159, 1, 26, 336453) But today he is angry.
('98', 159, 1, 27, 336476) The barbarities the Muslims have committed are on his brain.
('98', 159, 1, 28, 336537) He wants all Muslims to be driven out.
('98', 159, 1, 29, 336576) If similarly Pakistan says that Hindus have committed barbarities here and they should be driven out, I shall say it is foolish to say so.
('98', 159, 1, 30, 336715) It will be the limit of folly.
('98', 159, 1, 31, 336746) It is this attitude that was responsible for the partition of the country.
('98', 159, 1, 32, 336821) If you want to bring the two together, that can be done only if we become good.
('98', 159, 1, 33, 336901) Only the good and the noble can be brave.
('98', 159, 1, 34, 336943) Stupid people can never be brave.
('98', 159, 1, 35, 336977) Today the poison around us
('98', 159, 2, 36, 337004) 1 At the Indian Union Muslims’ Conference, which met on December 27 and 28, Abul Kalam Azad called for the winding up of the Muslim League in India.
('98', 159, 2, 37, 337153) The Conference unanimously adopted a resolution asking Muslims in India to dissolve all communal and political organisations and advising them to join the Congress.
('98', 160, 0, 1, 337318) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 161
('98', 160, 1, 2, 337365) is only increasing.
('98', 160, 1, 3, 337385) Kashmir has added more poison.
('98', 160, 1, 4, 337416) If there is a war both countries are going to bleed.
('98', 160, 1, 5, 337469) I do not wish to be alive to see that.
('98', 160, 1, 6, 337508) I do not wish to be a witness to that carnage.
('98', 160, 1, 7, 337555) I can only pray to God and ask you all to join in the prayer that He may take me away.
('98', 160, 1, 8, 337642) Why should we not so conduct ourselves that any conflict between India and Pakistan becomes impossible?
('98', 160, 1, 9, 337746) We must be brave and trust the Muslims.
('98', 160, 1, 10, 337786) If later they violate the trust you can cut off their heads.
('98', 160, 1, 11, 337847) But you cannot say that if anyone refuses to go to Pakistan his head should be cut off.
('98', 160, 1, 12, 337935) This means cutting off millions of heads on both sides of the border which would be the limit of madness.
('98', 160, 1, 13, 338041) There are now perhaps thirty or thirty five millions of Muslims in India.
('98', 160, 1, 14, 338115) If we harass them we shall not survive as a nation nor can our Hinduism.
('98', 160, 1, 15, 338188) I pray to God that He may cure us of this folly and this madness so that our country which has advanced may continue to make progress.
('98', 160, 1, 16, 338323) Today we seem to be falling and the sort of letter that the correspondent has written gives further impetus to the fall.
('98', 160, 1, 17, 338444) The note is written in English.
('98', 160, 1, 18, 338476) He writes English quite well, but I cannot praise him for that.

('98', 160, 5, 23, 338634) NEW DELHI, January 3, 1948
('98', 160, 6, 24, 338661) In the course of a long letter which Reverend Dr. John Haynes Holmes 1 had written to me before leaving the hospitable shores of India, he writes:
('98', 160, 7, 25, 338808) Of course you have been sad, well nigh overborne, by the tragedies of recent months, but you must never feel that this involves any breakdown of your life work.
('98', 160, 7, 26, 338969) Human nature cannot bear too much—it cracks under too great strain—and the strain in this case was as terrific as it was sudden.
('98', 160, 7, 27, 339098) But your

('98', 160, 8, 29, 339451) He met Gandhiji on October 12, 1947.

('98', 161, 1, 2, 339530) teaching remained as true and your leadership as sound as ever.
('98', 161, 1, 3, 339594) Single handed you saved the situation, and brought victory out of what seemed for the moment to be defeat.
('98', 161, 1, 4, 339701) I count these last few months to be the crown and climax of your unparalleled career.
('98', 161, 1, 5, 339787) You were never so great as in these dark hours.
('98', 161, 1, 6, 339835) I wonder if the claim can be proved.
('98', 161, 1, 7, 339872) That much more than Dr. Holmes observed can be proved of ahimsa, I have not the slightest doubt.
('98', 161, 1, 8, 339969) My difficulty is fundamental.
('98', 161, 1, 9, 339999) Have I attained the requisite qualifications for exhibiting the virtues of ahimsa, even as Dr. Holmes has said?
('98', 161, 1, 10, 340111) Knowing as I do the working of ahimsa, however imperfectly, I see every reason for the utmost caution in advancing claims that cannot be proved beyond a doubt.

('98', 161, 5, 17, 340472) When iron is heated sparks fly from it.

('98', 162, 9, 11, 341508) It does not appear likely that I shall be able to get out of here.
('98', 162, 9, 12, 341575) I have to do or die.
('98', 162, 9, 13, 341596) You may think there is peace in Delhi.
('98', 162, 9, 14, 341635) But that peace is not the peace of the hearts.
('98', 162, 9, 15, 341682) It is imposed by arms.
('98', 162, 9, 16, 341705) I am waiting for the call from within.
('98', 162, 9, 17, 341744) I have here three or four girls in attendance.
('98', 162, 9, 18, 341791) I am living in the palatial Birla House.

('98', 162, 9, 22, 341953) Of course the girls can leave whenever they want with my permission.
('98', 162, 9, 23, 342022) Only Manu has a part in this yajna.
('98', 162, 9, 24, 342058) The rest of the girls are here only accidentally.
('98', 162, 9, 25, 342108) They can go as they came.
('98', 162, 9, 26, 342134) I have to admit that Manu’s service in this yajna has been significant.
('98', 162, 9, 27, 342206) Only, she has been neglecting her body.
('98', 162, 9, 28, 342246) How are you all?
('98', 162, 9, 29, 342263) How is Khadi Pratishthan doing?

('98', 163, 7, 14, 343174) NEW DELHI, January 3, 1948
('98', 163, 8, 15, 343201) BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
('98', 163, 9, 16, 343223) I am happy to be able to fulfil the promise I made to you to visit the camp and speak a few words to you.
('98', 163, 9, 17, 343329) I am also happy to observe that there are almost as many women in the camp as there are men.
('98', 163, 9, 18, 343422) First of all I shall request you to join me in the prayer that peace and love may again be established in India and the world and all men may become brothers.
('98', 163, 9, 19, 343581) Today there is no peace to be seen anywhere in the world.
('98', 163, 9, 20, 343639) Peace cannot be established with the help of money.
('98', 163, 9, 21, 343691) So long as there is no peace in the heart there can be no peace outside.
('98', 163, 9, 22, 343764) Only when peace issues from within the heart and is expressed through the eyes, words and actions of men can we say that peace has been established.
('98', 163, 9, 23, 343913) A man of peace can live happily even in a mud hut and has no thought of the morrow, for it is only God who knows what will happen on the morrow.
('98', 163, 9, 24, 344058) Shri Ramachandra, who was a man like us, had no idea when he was about to be installed on the throne that he would have to go into exile.
('98', 163, 9, 25, 344196) But he realized only too well that ooo
('98', 163, 10, 26, 344235) 1 Held at Wavell Canteen Refugee Camp
('98', 164, 0, 1, 344273) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 165
('98', 164, 1, 2, 344320) securing peace was not the same thing as securing a throne and that peace was not dependent on external conditions.
('98', 164, 1, 3, 344436) Therefore when he knew that he had to go to the forest his peace was not ruffled.
('98', 164, 1, 4, 344518) If Hindus and Sikhs could have that realization the madness that has seized them would have been cured and, whatever the actions of the Muslims, they themselves would have remained calm.
('98', 164, 1, 5, 344705) If Hindus and Sikhs even now realize this, I am sure it will have the most desirable effect on the Muslims.
('98', 164, 1, 6, 344813) I am told that this camp is being very well managed.
('98', 164, 1, 7, 344866) I cannot accept this assurance fully till I know that the refugees too fully participate in keeping the camp clean and that they co operate with the officials in every way.
('98', 164, 1, 8, 345039) I know how dirty the streets of Delhi are.
('98', 164, 1, 9, 345082) One can only say that the camp is well managed when it is made to look at least cleaner than the roads of Delhi.
('98', 164, 1, 10, 345195) I know the sufferings you have had to bear.
('98', 164, 1, 11, 345239) Some of you have come from well to do homes.
('98', 164, 1, 12, 345284) You must not hope here for the comforts you had in the past.
('98', 164, 1, 13, 345345) You must learn to adapt yourselves to the new situation and try with patient labour to improve your conditions.
('98', 164, 1, 14, 345457) I remember how on the eve of the Boer War in 1899 Englishmen had left the Transvaal for Natal.
('98', 164, 1, 15, 345552) They knew how to face hardships.
('98', 164, 1, 16, 345585) They all lived the same way.
('98', 164, 1, 17, 345614) One of them was an engineer and worked with me as a carpenter.
('98', 164, 1, 18, 345677) We have been a slave country for centuries and we have not learnt this virtue.
('98', 164, 1, 19, 345756) Now that we are free—and freedom is a precious thing—I hope our refugee brothers and sisters will learn something from their sufferings and make this an ideal camp so that people, if not from all over the world, least from all over India, can come and visit it and take pride in it.
('98', 164, 1, 20, 346039) The hymn that has been sung in the prayer just now means that we should surrender to God all that we possess and take from it only the barest minimum for our needs.
('98', 164, 1, 21, 346204) If we act in conformity with this hymn, not only this camp but the whole of Delhi will breathe a new life and all our hearts will be filled with an inner joy.

('98', 165, 1, 2, 346478) 170. QUESTION BOX1
('98', 165, 2, 3, 346497) Q. It does not matter whether the lingua franca be called Hindi or Hindustani; in any case the common language in actual use will remain Hindustani.
('98', 165, 2, 4, 346646) It cannot, however, be gainsaid that in advanced literature and science certain words will be necessary which can only be derived from Sanskrit.
('98', 165, 2, 5, 346791) Where is the harm in making this clear to the public?
('98', 165, 3, 6, 346845) A. The first part of the question would be correct provided the name adopted were accepted by all in the same light.
('98', 165, 3, 7, 346962) The controversy arises not over the name but what it is meant to convey.
('98', 165, 3, 8, 347035) In advanced literature and science we should not draw exclusively from Sanskrit.
('98', 165, 3, 9, 347116) A small committee can be appointed to prepare a dictionary of current words irrespective of their original source.
('98', 165, 4, 10, 347231) Q. With regard to the script, it would be burdensome to have to use two scripts in the conduct of the affairs of the nation.
('98', 165, 4, 11, 347356) Why not then adopt the Nagari script which is current in all provinces?
('98', 165, 4, 12, 347428) Does the two script proposal mean that the Central Government should use both the scripts in its correspondence and publications?
('98', 165, 4, 13, 347558) Would telegraph and other offices also have to use both the scripts?
('98', 165, 5, 14, 347627) I do not subscribe to the view often put forward that the two script proposal is meant to appease the Muslims.
('98', 165, 5, 15, 347738) Our concern should be to select the script which might be advantageous to the nation as a whole without wishing any injustice.
('98', 165, 5, 16, 347865) It would not be correct to hold that the adoption of the Nagari script would be harmful to Muslim interests.
('98', 165, 5, 17, 347974) As far as I can see, it would be necessary to adopt both the scripts, but only as a temporary measure— ultimately one script should be acceptable to all.
('98', 165, 5, 18, 348128) How can this be disputed?
('98', 165, 5, 19, 348154) A. With the adoption of the two scripts, the easier one will ultimately survive.
('98', 165, 5, 20, 348235) All that is wanted is that the Urdu script should not be boycotted, as such boycott would imply discrimination.
('98', 165, 5, 21, 348347) A controversy arose over such discrimination and this has now been accentuated.
('98', 165, 5, 22, 348427) With this background, we who believe in unity and are opposed to civil strife are bound to adopt both the scripts.
('98', 165, 5, 23, 348542) Again we cannot forget that many Hindus and Sikhs are ignorant of the Nagari script.
('98', 165, 5, 24, 348627) There is no question of all people having to learn both the scripts, but only of those liable to serve outside their province.
('98', 165, 5, 25, 348754) Nor is it suggested that all notices should be issued by the Central Government in both the scripts—but only those meant for all.
('98', 165, 6, 26, 348884) 1 A Hindi version of this appeared in Harijan Sevak, 11 1 1948. The questions were sent by Rameshchandra of Shillong; vide “Letter to Rameshchandra”, 4/5 1 1948.

('98', 166, 1, 2, 349093) Having regard to the present communal antagonism, the boycott of the Urdu script would be regarded as an antidemocratic measure.
('98', 166, 1, 3, 349222) The question whether telegraph and other offices would also have to use both the scripts is a minor one.
('98', 166, 1, 4, 349327) When we get rid of the incubus of the English language and the Roman script, our minds will be clearer and we shall realize the futility of such controversies.
('98', 166, 1, 5, 349487) While we must always refrain from an improper course with the object of appeasing others, there is no harm in conciliating when the course itself is intrinsically proper.
('98', 166, 1, 6, 349658) If all accepted our script willingly, it would be so good, but even to achieve this end it is necessary to retain both the scripts at present.

('98', 166, 2, 8, 349847) 171. FRAGMENT OF A LETTER
('98', 166, 3, 9, 349873) January 4, 1948 Who knows what will happen tomorrow?
('98', 166, 3, 10, 349926) Everything about me is uncertain.
('98', 166, 3, 11, 349960) But I am moving towards light.
('98', 166, 3, 12, 349991) Your leucorrhoea must be cured.
('98', 166, 3, 13, 350023) You should abstain from salt.
('98', 166, 3, 14, 350053) Pulses in this disease are as poison.
('98', 166, 3, 15, 350091) So are spices.
('98', 166, 3, 16, 350106) Hip baths, mudpacks on the stomach and rest are necessary.
('98', 166, 3, 17, 350165) Had you been here I would have made you fast.
('98', 166, 3, 18, 350211) But I have full faith that if you resort to these external remedies and recite Ramanama with your whole heart, you will certainly be cured of the disease.
('98', 166, 3, 19, 350366) In India 75 per cent of the women suffer from this ailment.
('98', 166, 3, 20, 350426) The main reason is the feeling of shame associated with it, total ignorance about the matter and unnatural eating and Iiving.
('98', 166, 3, 21, 350552) It wilI not be wrong to say that our sisters do not have any idea of how terrible and painful this disease is.
('98', 166, 3, 22, 350663) I have made up my mind that if I can extricate myself from my present involvements my first task will be to tackle all these diseases of women through nature cure.
('98', 166, 3, 23, 350827) But today this seems fanciful.
('98', 166, 3, 24, 350858) Chand is not yet fully restored.
('98', 166, 3, 25, 350891) Her disease is more of the mind than of the body.
('98', 166, 3, 26, 350941) Abha and Manu are well.
('98', 166, 3, 27, 350965) Sushila is due here today from Bombay.
('98', 166, 3, 28, 351004) I write this in the early morning.
('98', 166, 3, 29, 351039) Even if I can write to you only occasionally, you should write to me regularly.
('98', 166, 3, 30, 351119) The rest from Manu.

('98', 167, 3, 4, 351286) Children should not write in pencil.
('98', 167, 3, 5, 351323) They should not use a fountain pen.
('98', 167, 3, 6, 351359) Writing with a reed pen improves the handwriting.
('98', 167, 3, 7, 351409) I hope you help your mother with domestic chores and regularly spin half an hour every day.
('98', 167, 3, 8, 351501) You should do physical exercises and make your body strong.
('98', 167, 3, 9, 351561) I hope you have learnt to make chapatis and cook vegetables.
('98', 167, 3, 10, 351622) Anyway you will tell me when we meet.
('98', 167, 3, 11, 351660) Be cheerful and happy.

('98', 167, 7, 16, 351800) NEW DELHI, January 4, 1948
('98', 167, 8, 17, 351827) BHAI GODBOLE, I have your letter.
('98', 167, 8, 18, 351861) The first book was a translation of Dr. Lindlahr’s book, was it not?
('98', 167, 8, 19, 351930) Are there any other books by him?
('98', 167, 8, 20, 351964) I no longer hold the view I had held earlier.
('98', 167, 8, 21, 352010) Greater experience has convinced me that Dr. Lindlahr’s book is quite ordinary.
('98', 167, 8, 22, 352090) His book has gained very little currency in America.
('98', 167, 8, 23, 352143) Anyway you may send me your book.
('98', 167, 8, 24, 352177) I would like to see it when I have some leisure.
('98', 167, 8, 25, 352226) The publication of the book should not be held up for the sake of my foreword.
('98', 167, 8, 26, 352305) I feel grateful that you have agreed to render some help at Uruli.
('98', 167, 8, 27, 352372) You should go there and see things for yourself.
('98', 167, 8, 28, 352421) It has a trust of which Dr. Mehta is one of the trustees.
('98', 167, 8, 29, 352479) There is no harm in doing that.
('98', 167, 8, 30, 352511) I am writing to the Secretary of the Trust about your letter.

('98', 168, 7, 11, 353146) NEW DELHI, January 4, 1948
('98', 168, 8, 12, 353173) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, I have been a little late today because it had been raining and I was told that I should be in no hurry for I might not find many people here.
('98', 168, 8, 13, 353338) But I said that no matter how small the audience, it was my duty to be present.
('98', 168, 8, 14, 353418) There was also some other business to attend to and this took a few minutes.
('98', 168, 8, 15, 353495) I thank you for having come in spite of the rain and it gives me much satisfaction that there are so many of you.
('98', 168, 8, 16, 353609) It shows that you are keen on the prayer.
('98', 168, 8, 17, 353651) If you have come merely out of curiosity then it has no value.
('98', 168, 8, 18, 353714) Today there is talk of war everywhere.
('98', 168, 8, 19, 353753) Everyone fears a war breaking out between the two countries.
('98', 168, 8, 20, 353814) If that happens it will be a calamity both for India and for Pakistan.
('98', 168, 8, 21, 353885) India has written to the U. N. because whenever there is a fear of conflict anywhere the U. N. is asked to promote a settlement and to stop fighting from breaking out.
('98', 168, 8, 22, 354053) India therefore wrote to the U. N. O. However trivial the issue may appear to be, it could lead to a war between the two countries.
('98', 168, 8, 23, 354185) It is a long memorandum and it has been cabled.
('98', 168, 8, 24, 354233) 3 Pakistan’s Zafarullah
('98', 168, 9, 25, 354257) 1 The addressee was the first to introduce full responsible government in the State in 1939. Aundh was one of the eight States which made up the United Deccan State formed on December 20, 1947, at Miraj.
('98', 168, 9, 26, 354461) 2 For details, vide “Speech at Prayer Meeting”, 6 1 1948. 3 On January 1, 1948, the Government of India submitted a formal complaint to the Security Council.

('98', 169, 0, 1, 354705) 170 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 169, 1, 2, 354747) Khan 1 and Liaquat Ali Khan 2 have since issued long statements.
('98', 169, 1, 3, 354812) I would take leave to say that their argument does not appeal to me.
('98', 169, 1, 4, 354881) You may ask if I approve of the Union Government approaching the U. N. O. I may say that I both approve and do not approve of what they did.
('98', 169, 1, 5, 355022) I approve of it, because after all what else are they to do?
('98', 169, 1, 6, 355083) They are convinced that what they are doing is right.
('98', 169, 1, 7, 355137) If there are raids from outside the frontier of Kashmir, the obvious conclusion is that it must be with the connivance of Pakistan.
('98', 169, 1, 8, 355269) Pakistan can deny it.
('98', 169, 1, 9, 355291) But the denial does not settle the matter.
('98', 169, 1, 10, 355334) Kashmir has acceded to India.
('98', 169, 1, 11, 355364) And India has accepted the accession upon certain conditions.
('98', 169, 1, 12, 355426) If Pakistan harasses Kashmir and if Sheikh Abdullah who is the leader of Kashmir asks the Indian Union for help, the latter is bound to send help.
('98', 169, 1, 13, 355573) Such help therefore was sent to Kashmir.
('98', 169, 1, 14, 355614) At the same time Pakistan is being requested to get out of Kashmir and to arrive at a settlement with India over the question through bilateral negotiations.
('98', 169, 1, 15, 355772) If no settlement can be reached in this way then a war is inevitable.
('98', 169, 1, 16, 355842) It is to avoid the possibility of war that the Union Government has taken the step it did.
('98', 169, 1, 17, 355933) Whether they are right in doing so or not God alone knows.
('98', 169, 1, 18, 355992) Whatever might have been the attitude of Pakistan, if I had my way I would have invited Pakistan’s representatives to India and we could have met, discussed the matter and worked out some settlement.
('98', 169, 1, 19, 356192) They keep saying that they want an amicable settlement but they do nothing to create the conditions for such a settlement.
('98', 169, 1, 20, 356315) I shall therefore humbly say to the responsible leaders of Pakistan that though we are now two countries—which is a thing I never wanted—we should at least try to arrive at an agreement so that we could live as peaceful
('98', 169, 2, 21, 356535) 1 At a Press conference at Karachi, on January 1, Mohammad Zafarullah Khan, Pakistan Foreign Minister, denying Pakistan’s complicity in the attack on Kashmir had stated: “Kashmir on all sides was surrounded by predominantly Muslim areas and realizing that something was to be done to help the Kashmir Muslims in their plight, individual Muslims from the surrounding areas did whatever they could to bring help.” 2 Denying the charges of aggression and looting, the Prime Minister of Pakistan had, among other things, stated on January 3: “There are some who are helping the forces of the Azad Kashmir Government, who have come from tribal areas because of the reports .
('98', 169, 2, 22, 357205) of the general massacre of Muslims that had been going on in Kashmir by armed bands of Hindus, Sikhs and troops of the Maharaja.” He claimed that “the conspiracy and plans for the occupation of Kashmir by Indian troops were laid well in advance and the excuse that India sent her troops because of the so called invaders having entered Kashmir territory, was only intended to deceive the world.” He further said that “we made it clear that we had no control over the forces of the Provisional Government of Kashmir or the tribesmen, engaged in fight.”

('98', 170, 1, 2, 357804) neighbours.
('98', 170, 1, 3, 357816) Let us grant for the sake of argument that all Indians are bad, but Pakistan at least is a new born nation which has moreover come into being in the name of religion and it should at least keep itself clean.
('98', 170, 1, 4, 358024) But they themselves make no such claim.
('98', 170, 1, 5, 358064) It is not their argument that Muslims have committed no atrocities in Pakistan.
('98', 170, 1, 6, 358144) I shall therefore suggest that it is now their duty, as far as possible, to arrive at an amicable understanding with India and live in harmony with her.
('98', 170, 1, 7, 358297) Mistakes were made on both sides.
('98', 170, 1, 8, 358331) Of this I have no doubt.
('98', 170, 1, 9, 358356) But this does not mean that we should persist in those mistakes, for then in the end we shall only destroy ourselves in a war and the whole of the sub continent will pass into the hands of some third power.
('98', 170, 1, 10, 358563) That will be the worst imaginable fate for us.
('98', 170, 1, 11, 358610) I shudder to think of it.
('98', 170, 1, 12, 358636) Therefore the two Dominions should come together with God as witness and find a settlement.
('98', 170, 1, 13, 358728) The matter is now before the U. N. O. It cannot be withdrawn from there.
('98', 170, 1, 14, 358801) But if India and Pakistan come to a settlement the big powers in the U.N.O. will have to endorse that settlement.
('98', 170, 1, 15, 358915) They will not object to the settlement.
('98', 170, 1, 16, 358955) They themselves can only say that they will do their best to see that the two countries arrive at an understanding through mutual discussions.
('98', 170, 1, 17, 359098) Let us pray to God that He may spare us the threatened strife, but not at any price.
('98', 170, 1, 18, 359183) All that we may pray to God is to grant that we may either learn to live in amity with each other or if we must fight to let us fight to the very end.
('98', 170, 1, 19, 359334) That may be folly, but sooner or later it will purify us.
('98', 170, 1, 20, 359392) Now a few words about Delhi.
('98', 170, 1, 21, 359421) I came to know of the incidents which took place last evening throught Brijkishan.
('98', 170, 1, 22, 359504) I had gone to the Camp 1 for the evening prayer, I came away after the prayer but he had stayed over to talk to the people in the Camp.
('98', 170, 1, 23, 359640) There are some Muslim houses at a little distance from the Camp.
('98', 170, 1, 24, 359705) About four or five hundred inmates of the Camp— mostly women and children but also some men—issued out of the Camp to take possession of the houses.
('98', 170, 1, 25, 359854) I am told they did not indulge in any kind of violence.
('98', 170, 1, 26, 359910) Some of the houses were vacant.
('98', 170, 1, 27, 359942) Some were occupied by the owners.
('98', 170, 1, 28, 359976) They tried to take possession even of the latter.
('98', 170, 1, 29, 360026) The police were near at hand.
('98', 170, 1, 30, 360056) They immediately went to the spot and brought the situation under control at about 9 O’clock according to the newspapers but about 11 O’clock according to the information I have.
('98', 170, 1, 31, 360235) The police have stayed on there.
('98', 170, 1, 32, 360268) I understand they had to use tear gas.
('98', 170, 1, 33, 360307) Tear gas does not kill but it can be pretty painful.
('98', 170, 1, 34, 360360) I am told that something has happened today again.

('98', 171, 1, 2, 360483) All I can say is that it is a matter of great shame for us.
('98', 171, 1, 3, 360543) Have not the refugees learnt even from their immense suffering that they have to exercise some restraint?
('98', 171, 1, 4, 360649) It is highly improper to go and occupy other people’s houses.
('98', 171, 1, 5, 360711) It is for the Government to find them shelter or whatever else they need.
('98', 171, 1, 6, 360785) Today the Government is our own.
('98', 171, 1, 7, 360818) But if we defy our own Government and defy the police and forcibly occupy houses the Government is not likely to continue for long.
('98', 171, 1, 8, 360950) It is still worse that such things should happen in the capital city of India where there are so many ambassadors from all over the world.
('98', 171, 1, 9, 361089) Do we want to show them the spectacle of people occupying whatever they can?
('98', 171, 1, 10, 361166) It is all the more regrettable that women and children were used as a shield.
('98', 171, 1, 11, 361244) It is inhuman.
('98', 171, 1, 12, 361259) It is like Muslim rulers keeping a herd of cows in the vanguard of their armies to make sure that the Hindus would not fight.
('98', 171, 1, 13, 361385) It is uncivilized, barbaric behaviour.
('98', 171, 1, 14, 361424) It is still more barbaric to put women and children in front to provide against the police making a lathi charge.
('98', 171, 1, 15, 361538) It is abuse of womanhood.
('98', 171, 1, 16, 361564) I must humbly ask all the refugees—women and children— not to behave in this way.
('98', 171, 1, 17, 361646) Let them settle down.
('98', 171, 1, 18, 361668) If they don’t, then apart from a war between India and Pakistan, we may kill ourselves in mutual strife.
('98', 171, 1, 19, 361773) We may lose Delhi and make ourselves the laughing stock of the world.
('98', 171, 1, 20, 361843) If we want to keep India a free country, we must stop the things that are at present going on.

('98', 172, 13, 18, 363245) JIVANJI, What I have sent this time is worth thinking over.
('98', 172, 13, 19, 363305) The Gujarati items need not be translated into English there, nor the English into Gujarati or Hindustani.
('98', 172, 13, 20, 363412) Some of the Hindustani items will have to be translated into Gujarati there.
('98', 172, 13, 21, 363489) We try to send reports of my daily speeches in Hindustani, in such language as I actually use but with some revisions, and it is not, therefore, necessary to translate the speeches from English into Gujarati.
('98', 172, 13, 22, 363698) It will do even if you give only summaries from the Hindustani reports.
('98', 172, 13, 23, 363770) This will mean that the editions of Harijan in all the three languages will be self contained and independent of one another.
('98', 172, 13, 24, 363896) It remains to be seen whether we can attain this ideal.
('98', 172, 13, 25, 363952) I cannot say how long I shall be able to cope with the

('98', 174, 6, 11, 365794) Therefore, first you should persuade the Muslim brothers and get the arms from them and hand them over to me.

('98', 175, 2, 3, 366715) NEW DELHI, January 5, 1948
('98', 175, 3, 4, 366742) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, I am being flooded with letters and telegrams congratulating me on the lifting of controls on most things and pleading that the controls which still remain should be lifted.
('98', 175, 3, 5, 366938) I give below the substance of an English letter, written by a successful businessman.
('98', 175, 3, 6, 367024) The letter says:

('98', 176, 1, 2, 368293) expectation that control on cotton textiles will be lifted their prices are slowly falling.
('98', 176, 1, 3, 368385) If the control is lifted then the prices are likely to fall by 60 p.
('98', 176, 1, 4, 368454) This will lead to competition among the various mills and make cloth more easily available.
('98', 176, 1, 5, 368546) But if control on cotton textile is lifted the export of cloth from India should be banned for at least three years.
('98', 176, 1, 6, 368663) In Government offices they merely play mysterious games with the figures of statistics.
('98', 176, 1, 7, 368751) They should not hinder the implementation of decontrol.
('98', 176, 1, 8, 368807) Presumably petrol was controlled on account of the exigencies of war and can now be decontrolled.
('98', 176, 1, 9, 368905) The truth is that control on petrol has benefited only a few transport companies which have now a vested interest in keeping the control.
('98', 176, 1, 10, 369043) It does not benefit the masses.
('98', 176, 1, 11, 369075) It need hardly be pointed out that a single bus or truck which has a permit to ply on one particular stretch of road will be able to make Rs. 15,000 a month.
('98', 176, 1, 12, 369233) If the control on petrol is lifted one cannot earn more than Rs. 300 a month out of one vehicle.
('98', 176, 1, 13, 369330) Today petrol permits are freely being sold.
('98', 176, 1, 14, 369374) A petrol permit for one lorry can easily be sold to a transport magnate for as much as Rs. 10,000. If control is lifted the various problems before the country such as food, housing and so on will be solved by themselves.
('98', 176, 1, 15, 369596) Please try to have the control on petrol lifted and help the masses who are suffering on account of control.
('98', 176, 1, 16, 369705) A free India should have no use for controls.
('98', 176, 1, 17, 369751) It seems to me that there is not much one can say when faced with these figures.
('98', 176, 1, 18, 369832) Maybe I am ignorant, those with more knowledge should correct me.
('98', 176, 1, 19, 369898) 1 When people by and large want a thing there is no room left for any hesitation in a democracy.
('98', 176, 1, 20, 369995) It is said that India consumes merely one per cent of the amount of petrol produced in the world.
('98', 176, 1, 21, 370093) There is no cause for despair in this.
('98', 176, 1, 22, 370132) After all our road transport does go on.
('98', 176, 1, 23, 370173) But does it mean that because we are not a warlike people we do not need more petrol?
('98', 176, 1, 24, 370259) Or if we need more, will there be shortage for the rest of the world?
('98', 176, 1, 25, 370329) Let not the learned laugh at my ignorance.
('98', 176, 1, 26, 370372) I seek light.
('98', 176, 1, 27, 370386) If I hide the darkness I cannot get light.
('98', 176, 1, 28, 370429) The question is: If so little petrol falls to our share, how is it that huge stocks of petrol are available in the black market?
('98', 176, 1, 29, 370558) If the situation described by the correspondent really prevails it is shocking.
('98', 176, 1, 30, 370638) It means that controls are a boon to the rich and a bane for the poor.
('98', 176, 1, 31, 370709) And yet it is in the name of the poor that the controls are
('98', 176, 2, 32, 370769) 1 Commenting on this, A. D. Gorawala, former President of Commodities Prices Board, said in Bombay that the prices quoted before decontrol were black market prices and that “reports from various areas of Bombay showed that after decontrol prices had risen from 50 to 100 per cent above the controlled rates” for wheat and sugar.

('98', 177, 1, 3, 371149) If that is how monopoly functions it should be done away with without a moment’s thought.
('98', 177, 1, 4, 371239) As for cloth, if we have not forgotten khadi which has been described as “the livery of freedom’’ 1 there is no possible argument for continuing the control over it.
('98', 177, 1, 5, 371405) We have enough cotton and we have innumerable hands which can work the looms and the wheels in the villages.
('98', 177, 1, 6, 371514) We can thus produce without difficulty enough cloth for ourselves.
('98', 177, 1, 7, 371581) It needs neither the noise of the cities nor motor transport.
('98', 177, 1, 8, 371643) In former times the railways first served the need of the army.
('98', 177, 1, 9, 371707) Its second task was to carry cotton to the ports and carry cloth into the interior from the ports.
('98', 177, 1, 10, 371806) Now our calico is khadi.
('98', 177, 1, 11, 371831) It is made in villages and is consumed in villages.
('98', 177, 1, 12, 371883) There is therefore no need of centralization here.
('98', 177, 1, 13, 371934) Let us not ruin our villages out of our indolence or our ignorance.

('98', 177, 4, 18, 372112) A friend writes that khadi can help to remove the shortage of cloth in a matter of six months.
('98', 177, 4, 19, 372207) For this two conditions will be necessary, viz., (1) that the Central and Provincial Governments should adopt the policy of encouraging spinning and weaving in every village, and (2) that provincial and all India leaders should put forth greater efforts to popularize khadi.
('98', 177, 4, 20, 372482) In my opinion it should be worth while and it is the duty of the Congress to fulfil these conditions for the sake of remedying cloth shortage.
('98', 177, 4, 21, 372625) Our undoubted indifference in this respect shows that we have failed in our duty.
('98', 177, 4, 22, 372707) The price of cloth having risen so high, the present is the most opportune time to get over this indifference.
('98', 177, 4, 23, 372818) This can be done by the example and conduct as well as the wisdom of those who have unshakable faith in khadi.
('98', 177, 4, 24, 372929) When the Government adopts the policy of promoting the cause of khadi, control over cloth and other commodities will automatically go.
('98', 177, 4, 25, 373064) Meanwhile also, cloth should be decontrolled in the interests of the poor.

('98', 178, 2, 3, 373383) The same friend, who suggests that khadi can remove cloth shortage, writes that India having attained independence, there is little difference now between certified and uncertified khadi, mill cloth and foreign cloth.
('98', 178, 2, 4, 373601) Khadi may have significance for him who spins and weaves to clothe himself, but people are unable to do so or even to spin the minimum quota of yarn prescribed for the purchase of khadi from the bhandars.
('98', 178, 2, 5, 373806) No improvement is noticeable in the quality of pure khadi, while many useful varieties of uncertified khadi are available.
('98', 178, 2, 6, 373929) Moreover, it is difficult nowadays to give what can be termed a living wage in the khadi industry.
('98', 178, 2, 7, 374028) On these grounds the writer observes that the purchase of uncertified khadi should be permitted.
('98', 178, 2, 8, 374125) He proceeds to argue that having regard to the acute shortage of cloth all over the country and to the fact that the Union Government itself imports foreign cloth, there should be no objection to the purchase of such cloth either.
('98', 178, 2, 9, 374356) That such questions can be raised shows the change in the times.
('98', 178, 2, 10, 374421) My answer is that only “certified khadi” should be used.
('98', 178, 2, 11, 374478) Let me indicate the meaning of this term.
('98', 178, 2, 12, 374520) Even the Charkha Sangh’s definition is incomplete.
('98', 178, 2, 13, 374571) The term really implies that a reasonable wage is given to spinners and weavers and the price of khadi fixed with an eye on public good and not with a profit motive.
('98', 178, 2, 14, 374737) Certification of such khadi by the Charkha Sangh becomes necessary, as people have as a rule, to fall back upon the purchase of khadi in addition to self made (
('98', 178, 3, 15, 374898) <image: None, width: 32, height: 11, bpc: 1>
('98', 178, 4, 16, 374943) ) khadi.
('98', 178, 4, 17, 374952) Any other khadi is uncertified and open to objection and should not, therefore, be used.
('98', 178, 4, 18, 375041) It is open to the public to suggest improvements in the conditions presented for the certification of khadi, but it would be definitely wrong to abolish the distinction between certified and uncertified khadi.
('98', 178, 4, 19, 375251) Again, how can one shut one’s eyes to the distinction between khadi, mill cloth and foreign cloth, or justify the import of foreign cloth because foreign rule has ended?
('98', 178, 4, 20, 375421) We must remember that we opposed foreign rule because it involved the economic ruin of the country.
('98', 178, 4, 21, 375521) The first fruit of freedom should, therefore, be to put an end to this curse.
('98', 178, 4, 22, 375599) In fine it follows that pure khadi alone has place in swaraj: in it

('98', 179, 4, 6, 375936) Apropos the recent legislation enacted by the Government of Bombay extending to the Harijans the right of admission to temples, wells, dharmashalas, schools, hostels, etc., Shri Parikshitlal writes that though this automatically covers undenominational hostels as well, school and college hostels have not in actual practice been thrown open to the Harijan students.
('98', 179, 4, 7, 376303) His experience has been that the school and college authorities have not adapted themselves to the spirit of the times to the extent the hostel students have.
('98', 179, 4, 8, 376462) As the academic year will soon be over and fresh admissions will be made shortly, he has advised the authorities to do the needful before the Harijan students are forced to assert their legal right in the matter and has also suggested to me to recommend the throwing open of the hostels in Bhavnagar and other Kathiawar States to the Harijan students.
('98', 179, 4, 9, 376814) I endorse his suggestion and would add that if the students in the hostels are sincere, they are sure to succeed in the matter.
('98', 179, 4, 10, 376942) In the present age the autocratic will of the managing committees cannot prevail, particularly when, as in this case, they are in the wrong and the students are in the right.
('98', 179, 4, 11, 377117) Be that as it may, the Harijan students should unquestionably be admitted to hostels with honour.

('98', 179, 8, 17, 377316) SITA, I have your letter.
('98', 179, 8, 18, 377342) The previous one was long and I could not cope with it.
('98', 179, 8, 19, 377398) I am writing this immediately after prayers.

('98', 180, 1, 3, 377709) Your dream of helping Manilal will also materialize to some extent.
('98', 180, 1, 4, 377777) Who knows what is in store?
('98', 180, 1, 5, 377805) It is good news that Vasant and the baby boy are well.
('98', 180, 1, 6, 377860) Nowadays they look for names from novels or from the Sanskirt plays.
('98', 180, 1, 7, 377929) I would know nothing about it.
('98', 180, 1, 8, 377960) What is in a name?
('98', 180, 1, 9, 377979) It seldom happens that a person comes to have qualities worthy of his name.

('98', 180, 5, 16, 378317) m., January 6, 1948
('98', 180, 6, 17, 378337) SUSHILA, I have had two letters from you, one of which is lying in the heap.
('98', 180, 6, 18, 378414) The one to which I am replying was received yesterday.
('98', 180, 6, 19, 378469) I am glad that Sita is going there.
('98', 180, 6, 20, 378505) I should not be glad but there is a reason for it.
('98', 180, 6, 21, 378556) Your duty seems clear.
('98', 180, 6, 22, 378579) You must give all possible help to Manilal in his work, forgetting everything else.
('98', 180, 6, 23, 378663) Ordinarily I would not give such advice, but in this case I have reason for doing so.
('98', 180, 6, 24, 378749) Since Manilal is engaged in public service, I feel that it would be a great thing if you could identify yourself with him.
('98', 180, 6, 25, 378872) The statement that ordinarily I would not give such advice refers to cases in which the husband tries to tempt his wife to pleasure.
('98', 180, 6, 26, 379005) 1 should like you to retain only one attachment, giving up all others, and I have explained to you what that is.
('98', 180, 6, 27, 379118) I am not asking you to look after the children carefully because they are yours, but since they are under your charge you ought to protect them.
('98', 180, 6, 28, 379263) That would have been your duty even if they had not been your own children.
('98', 180, 6, 29, 379339) I have tried to follow this rule from a very young age.
('98', 180, 6, 30, 379395) Manilal knows about it.
('98', 180, 6, 31, 379419) For you service of the country will be where Manilal lives.
('98', 180, 6, 32, 379479) You may do whatever you can to help the struggle there without

('98', 181, 1, 3, 379608) I am glad that you have succeeded in persuading Manilal to take milk and curds.

('98', 181, 5, 8, 379817) NEW DELHI, 5 a.
('98', 181, 5, 9, 379833) m., January 6, 1948
('98', 181, 6, 10, 379853) MANILAL, I could get no time at all before now to write to you.
('98', 181, 6, 11, 379917) I got the mail yesterday and so am writing this letter.
('98', 181, 6, 12, 379973) I am forced to the conclusion that your health has suffered because of lack of curds and milk in your diet.
('98', 181, 6, 13, 380081) In the wide vegetable kingdom nothing has been discovered so far which can serve as a substitute for milk.
('98', 181, 6, 14, 380188) As long as one keeps fit, one does not feel the need for animal foods, but once the health goes down it cannot be rebuilt without such foods.
('98', 181, 6, 15, 380330) Now that Sita is going there, you will get all the help you need.
('98', 181, 6, 16, 380396) I agree that her studies will suffer there.
('98', 181, 6, 17, 380440) But she will certainly learn what I believe she ought to learn, namely, whatever she can while helping her parents in their work under their own guidance.
('98', 181, 6, 18, 380595) This is real economics.
('98', 181, 6, 19, 380619) I have no time just now to explain why.
('98', 181, 6, 20, 380659) Probably you don’t even need an explanation.
('98', 181, 6, 21, 380704) Do what you can in connection with the struggle there which is going to be a difficult one.
('98', 181, 6, 22, 380796) I have so far maintained my health in spite of the great pressure of work.
('98', 181, 6, 23, 380871) God will do as He wills.
('98', 181, 6, 24, 380896) Sushila 1 was to proceed to America in a few days for further experience.
('98', 181, 6, 25, 380970) But now those people have on their own put off the visit.
('98', 181, 6, 26, 381028) Let us see what happens.
('98', 181, 6, 27, 381053) According to me, what we cannot get in our own country will be of no use to us.
('98', 181, 6, 28, 381133) But I am not able to convince anybody about this.

('98', 183, 1, 4, 382444) Third, he suffers bodily affliction.
('98', 183, 1, 5, 382481) Day and night he is sickly.
('98', 183, 1, 6, 382509) His eyes cannot glimpse happiness.
('98', 183, 1, 7, 382544) His life is spent in pain.
('98', 183, 1, 8, 382571) In three ways thus he is a pauper.
('98', 183, 1, 9, 382606) But he thinks only of Him, And is ever alight with the knowledge, That all things are yoked to the Nameless God.
('98', 183, 1, 10, 382719) He who does not know these three things, has really attained nothing.

('98', 184, 12, 18, 384206) BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
('98', 184, 13, 19, 384228) I hear that even today people have been trying to get into the Muslim houses.
('98', 184, 13, 20, 384306) The police have been doing their duty and trying to stop them.
('98', 184, 13, 21, 384369) After all what can the police do?
('98', 184, 13, 22, 384403) They can only resort to tear gas.
('98', 184, 13, 23, 384437) I am told that that was what they did.
('98', 184, 13, 24, 384476) There is plenty of room here.
('98', 184, 13, 25, 384506) One cannot say that Delhi lacks space.
('98', 184, 13, 26, 384545) There is no doubt that refugees are in a bad plight.
('98', 184, 13, 27, 384598) It is not right that they should have to live under the open sky.
('98', 184, 13, 28, 384664) When it rains it is not enough that they should have only a cloth between them and the sky.
('98', 184, 13, 29, 384756) Therefore, in distress they resort to anything.
('98', 184, 13, 30, 384804) But it does not seem right that they should single out only Muslim houses.
('98', 184, 13, 31, 384879) I told one of them that this was a pretty big house, a large number of men could be accommodated
('98', 185, 0, 1, 384976) 186 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 185, 1, 2, 385018) They could throw me out and also throw out the ailing woman with me and afterwards the owner.
('98', 185, 1, 3, 385112) He said that it was easy for me to find accommodation but who would give the refugees any accommodation?
('98', 185, 1, 4, 385217) I would understand what they are doing if every other recourse had failed and if the people of Delhi had also failed them.
('98', 185, 1, 5, 385340) But it is not good—it will do us no good to occupy the houses of those we have scared away or driven out.
('98', 185, 1, 6, 385446) The police today offered the refugees a few houses which they refused.
('98', 185, 1, 7, 385517) Let them say clearly that they do not want any Muslims here.
('98', 185, 1, 8, 385578) It would not be decent but at least it would have the virtue of being a straightforward course.
('98', 185, 1, 9, 385674) They may say that since the Muslims have killed Hindus in Pakistan they shall kill the Muslims in India or that they do not trust them.
('98', 185, 1, 10, 385810) But what is happening today is sheer madness.
('98', 185, 1, 11, 385856) Our present misfortune is that people unthinkingly indulge in meaningless rowdyism.
('98', 185, 1, 12, 385940) The mentality seems to be that now that we are a free country we can do what we like.
('98', 185, 1, 13, 386026) A report from Bombay says that the Government there is in a great difficulty.
('98', 185, 1, 14, 386104) Dock workers have gone on a strike.
('98', 185, 1, 15, 386140) 1 Such strikes are going to be our undoing, to say nothing of the fact that they can bring no benefit to the workers whichever the party behind the strike may be, Congress or Socialist or Communist or any other.
('98', 185, 1, 16, 386352) Our country today is passing through a critical phase.
('98', 185, 1, 17, 386407) Our effort should be to tide over the present situation and survive.
('98', 185, 1, 18, 386476) I have a letter from the Maharaja of Aundh, a small State in Maharashtra.
('98', 185, 1, 19, 386550) 2 He had even when the British rule was still strong in India handed over the reins of the government to the people of his State.
('98', 185, 1, 20, 386680) He and his son felt that they should serve the people.
('98', 185, 1, 21, 386735) They devised a constitution, had a body elected and made it responsible for the administration.
('98', 185, 1, 22, 386831) The Maharaja writes that the feeling among the other Rulers is that whatever he may do he should only do along with the other Rulers and that he should not act all by himself.
('98', 185, 1, 23, 387007) He has almost decided to merge his State with India but he still continues to be the Raja, though only as a servant of his people.
('98', 185, 1, 24, 387138) He will accept whatever is sanctioned to him by his people.
('98', 185, 1, 25, 387198) Sardar Saheb feels that the Rulers should be given pensions, unconditionally, whether they

('98', 186, 1, 2, 387528) functioned as such or not.
('98', 186, 1, 3, 387555) He has started the process with Orissa.
('98', 186, 1, 4, 387595) 1 I do not consider it right that the Maharaja of Aundh should be pensioned off.
('98', 186, 1, 5, 387676) Only he should not interfere in the administration because the State now has responsible Government.
('98', 186, 1, 6, 387777) But he has been told that the nature of administration in his State cannot be different from what it is in other States that have merged with India.
('98', 186, 1, 7, 387926) It cannot have separate laws.
('98', 186, 1, 8, 387956) But I say there is no need for any laws.
('98', 186, 1, 9, 387997) When the power has been handed over to the people it does not mean that the administration should be conducted from Delhi.
('98', 186, 1, 10, 388120) If there is a representative government it wilI have villagers on it.
('98', 186, 1, 11, 388190) Such a body should run the administration.
('98', 186, 1, 12, 388233) There should be no need to interfere with its work.
('98', 186, 1, 13, 388285) Nor can any law be made for interfering with it.
('98', 186, 1, 14, 388334) Otherwise it would not be popular rule.
('98', 186, 1, 15, 388374) Popular rule cannot be established by the sword.
('98', 186, 1, 16, 388423) A friend writes that only a happy country can be said to have Ramarajya, that we may import goods from outside, but only as much as we can export, so that the trade is balanced.
('98', 186, 1, 17, 388601) He says this has not been the case with us.
('98', 186, 1, 18, 388645) We have always been debtors.
('98', 186, 1, 19, 388674) Lately we have become creditors.
('98', 186, 1, 20, 388707) But how long can we remain creditors if we keep up the present rate of spending?
('98', 186, 1, 21, 388788) What we should do is to have the very minimum of imports and the very maximum of exports.
('98', 186, 1, 22, 388878) Only then can we have a surplus of foreign exchange.
('98', 186, 1, 23, 388931) The fact is that what we import from outside is only our raw material converted into consumer goods.
('98', 186, 1, 24, 389032) Our aim should be that we should have no need for importing anything or if we import anything it should only be to help other countries.
('98', 186, 1, 25, 389169) If some country needs money and asks us for it we should be able to send the money.
('98', 186, 1, 26, 389253) The correspondent is right in saying that so far America alone is such a country.
('98', 186, 1, 27, 389335) We do not want to be like America but at least we can reduce our imports to match our exports.

('98', 187, 14, 23, 390667) 1 On January 6, 184 Sikh refugees from upper Sind had arrived in Karachi in the morning by train.
('98', 187, 14, 24, 390765) While proceeding in open carriages to the Gurdwara at Ratan Talao, they were followed by a Muslim mob and stoned all the way.
('98', 187, 14, 25, 390891) Nearly 8,000 Muslims surrounded the Gurdwara, scaled its walls and pounced upon the refugees.
('98', 187, 14, 26, 390985) The trouble spread through the city and nearly 2,000 shops and tenements, mostly belonging to Hindus, were broken open and property worth one crore was looted.
('98', 187, 14, 27, 391145) Over 120 Hindus and Sikhs were reported to have been killed.
('98', 187, 14, 28, 391206) The authorities, unable to control the situation, called in the troops at 2 p.
('98', 187, 14, 29, 391285) and a curfew was imposed.

('98', 188, 1, 3, 391451) Afterwards the rush of visitors begins.
('98', 188, 1, 4, 391491) I must achieve something or die in the attempt.
('98', 188, 1, 5, 391539) I cannot say what will happen.
('98', 188, 1, 6, 391570) I seek light.
('98', 188, 1, 7, 391584) I can glimpse some rays in the darkness.
('98', 188, 1, 8, 391625) Only when I attain enlightenment in full, shall heart unity in Delhi be enduring.
('98', 188, 1, 9, 391707) Well, I have managed to write this with great difficulty.
('98', 188, 1, 10, 391765) How are you all?
('98', 188, 1, 11, 391782) How is your health?
('98', 188, 1, 12, 391802) You must keep writing to Manu.
('98', 188, 1, 13, 391833) She will write the rest.
('98', 188, 1, 14, 391858) I have not succeeded in bringing her back to health.
('98', 188, 1, 15, 391911) She wrecked her body in serving me in Noakhali.
('98', 188, 1, 16, 391959) If she can regain her strength I shall be immensely relieved.
('98', 188, 1, 17, 392021) If she could follow my advice and give herself rest for a couple of months and be cheerful, I would see about the outward treatment.
('98', 188, 1, 18, 392154) Today this is not possible.
('98', 188, 1, 19, 392182) I cannot give her my full attention.
('98', 188, 1, 20, 392219) If I can bring matters here to some conclusion, my next task will be to make Manu strong as a wrestler.
('98', 188, 1, 21, 392323) Or else she may well die.

('98', 188, 10, 35, 392770) NEW DELHI, January 7, 1948
('98', 188, 11, 36, 392797) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, I have here several notes and I shall try to deal with as many as I can within 15 minutes.
('98', 188, 11, 37, 392910) A friend writes that he has gone on an indefinite fast.
('98', 188, 11, 38, 392966) All that I can say is that it is not right for him to fast.
('98', 188, 11, 39, 393026) To resort to a fast thus is a
('98', 189, 0, 1, 393056) 190 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 189, 1, 2, 393098) While I am alive I should be consulted because I have much experience of fasting.
('98', 189, 1, 3, 393180) I shall not go into the matter further.
('98', 189, 1, 4, 393220) I am told that students are about to go on a strike.
('98', 189, 1, 5, 393273) The date set is the 9th.
('98', 189, 1, 6, 393298) I must say that it will be a wrong step.
('98', 189, 1, 7, 393339) As I pointed out yesterday, to resort to strikes to gain one’s end is not a good thing.
('98', 189, 1, 8, 393427) I have no doubt in my mind that it is not non violence.
('98', 189, 1, 9, 393483) I have conducted many non violent strikes.
('98', 189, 1, 10, 393526) It cannot be said that every strike is non violent and every strike is legitimate.
('98', 189, 1, 11, 393609) Students should confine themselves to studies and keep away from strikes.
('98', 189, 1, 12, 393683) I hope they will listen to me.
('98', 189, 1, 13, 393714) I may again mention that I have had a long experience spanning some fifty years of non violent strikes.
('98', 189, 1, 14, 393818) I carried it on successfully not in India but in South Africa.
('98', 189, 1, 15, 393881) I do not remember any instance when it failed me in anything I had undertaken.
('98', 189, 1, 16, 393960) It cannot fail.
('98', 189, 1, 17, 393976) If your cause is just and if what you are doing is the only course open to you, you are bound to succeed.
('98', 189, 1, 18, 394082) Today I received visitors from the Punjab, Sind, the Frontier Province and other places—all in Pakistan.
('98', 189, 1, 19, 394187) They described to me their sufferings and asked me why I was not doing anything in the matter.
('98', 189, 1, 20, 394282) How can they know all that I am trying to do?
('98', 189, 1, 21, 394328) The only reason I am staying on here is that I may be able to get something done somehow for these people.
('98', 189, 1, 22, 394435) Today I have become weak.
('98', 189, 1, 23, 394461) Time was when what I said went home.
('98', 189, 1, 24, 394498) Today it is not the case.
('98', 189, 1, 25, 394524) Then I was the General of non violence.
('98', 189, 1, 26, 394564) Now that time is past.
('98', 189, 1, 27, 394587) Today mine is a cry in the wilderness.
('98', 189, 1, 28, 394626) But even if I am alone I must say what is right.
('98', 189, 1, 29, 394675) People say that the Government is manned by persons who are my co workers and that they will do whatever I say.
('98', 189, 1, 30, 394787) It is true that they are my co workers, but why should they do whatever I say?
('98', 189, 1, 31, 394866) They will only do what seems right to them.
('98', 189, 1, 32, 394910) I can plead with them and argue with them.
('98', 189, 1, 33, 394953) If they see the point, well and good; if not, I am helpless.
('98', 189, 1, 34, 395014) They might tell me that running a government is full of complications and difficulties, and that if I were in the Government I would find out that I could not do as I pleased.
('98', 189, 1, 35, 395190) If the Ministers who are my friends, their secretaries and the police, for I am no one’s enemy, were all to go by what I said all would be well.
('98', 189, 1, 36, 395335) The Government can always say that they have not the right type of officials and staff.
('98', 189, 1, 37, 395423) They are the same people who were there during the British rule.
('98', 189, 1, 38, 395488) They cannot be turned out either.
('98', 189, 1, 39, 395522) Whatever the reasons, I cannot make the Government today do all that I want.
('98', 189, 1, 40, 395599) I am as helpless as any one of you.
('98', 189, 1, 41, 395635) I am not God.
('98', 189, 1, 42, 395649) I do only what my strength permits.
('98', 190, 0, 1, 395685) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 191
('98', 190, 1, 2, 395732) But what are the people to do?
('98', 190, 1, 3, 395763) They have to have shelter, clothing and food.
('98', 190, 1, 4, 395809) When I myself have all those things, why should anyone be deprived of them?
('98', 190, 1, 5, 395885) After all they have not committed any crime like assault or murder.
('98', 190, 1, 6, 395953) They have been hounded out from their homes.
('98', 190, 1, 7, 395998) They are our brothers and sisters.
('98', 190, 1, 8, 396033) They have been subjected to indignities and injustice and if even on coming here they cannot live in peace they have the right to turn round and demand why they should be deprived of the necessities of life when they are freely available to others.
('98', 190, 1, 9, 396282) I admit this is unjust.
('98', 190, 1, 10, 396306) But I have told them what they can do.
('98', 190, 1, 11, 396345) The way is not for them to get into anyone’s house and occupy it.
('98', 190, 1, 12, 396411) Their attack should be non violent.
('98', 190, 1, 13, 396447) I have also told them which houses are thus to be attacked.
('98', 190, 1, 14, 396507) They must also agree to do any kind of work assigned to them to the extent that they can.
('98', 190, 1, 15, 396597) For instance you may not assign writing work to a man who cannot write.
('98', 190, 1, 16, 396669) But if you give a pickaxe to a man he should not say that he can only wield a pen.
('98', 190, 1, 17, 396752) Similarly they should live in any shelter that is given to them, be it a tent or a room.
('98', 190, 1, 18, 396841) All that is necessary is that there should be a roof overhead and it should not matter if it is only a thatched roof.
('98', 190, 1, 19, 396959) Similarly they do not need any cots.
('98', 190, 1, 20, 396996) One can sleep on straw very comfortably.
('98', 190, 1, 21, 397037) I know from experience that straw can be as warm as any cotton mattress.
('98', 190, 1, 22, 397110) Let us accept as a blessing from God anything we can get.
('98', 190, 1, 23, 397168) If people can learn contentment the few lakhs of refugees can be made reasonably happy.
('98', 190, 1, 24, 397256) There is plenty of room here.
('98', 190, 1, 25, 397286) Only their hearts should be clean.
('98', 190, 1, 26, 397321) Unfortunately the case is the very reverse.
('98', 190, 1, 27, 397365) You saw what has happened in Karachi.
('98', 190, 1, 28, 397403) 1 People used to say that such things could not happen in Sind.
('98', 190, 1, 29, 397467) I always said that Hindus could not live in peace in Sind.
('98', 190, 1, 30, 397526) And not only Hindus, even others.
('98', 190, 1, 31, 397560) That was proved yesterday.
('98', 190, 1, 32, 397587) They had assembled in a Gurdwara awaiting evacuation.
('98', 190, 1, 33, 397641) The Gurdwara was attacked.
('98', 190, 1, 34, 397668) A few were killed, some were injured.
('98', 190, 1, 35, 397706) The Government says that the situation was brought under control as soon as possible.
('98', 190, 1, 36, 397792) But in the first place such a thing should not have happened at all.
('98', 190, 1, 37, 397861) I must tell the Pakistan Government to see that such things do not happen or else they should quit the Government.
('98', 190, 1, 38, 397976) Maybe if there is no government there will be plunder and looting for a few days.
('98', 190, 1, 39, 398058) But later the situation will improve.
('98', 190, 1, 40, 398096) I have the same thing to say to the Government in India.
('98', 190, 1, 41, 398153) I shall not listen to the Government saying that people cannot be persuaded.
('98', 190, 1, 42, 398230) If the people

('98', 191, 0, 1, 398285) 192 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 191, 1, 2, 398327) cannot be persuaded they must give up the pretext of governing.
('98', 191, 1, 3, 398391) Both the Governments are the same in my eyes.
('98', 191, 1, 4, 398437) If the Pakistan Government allows the people to be murdered in this way, the Government will not last long.
('98', 191, 1, 5, 398545) To you, brothers, I shall only say, do not let yourselves become mad.
('98', 191, 1, 6, 398615) You must swallow your anger.
('98', 191, 1, 7, 398644) You must not answer anger with anger and say, ‘We will destroy the mosques, occupy them and kill the Muslims.’ This will not be just.
('98', 191, 1, 8, 398778) Such personal vengeance will put an end to the rule of law.
('98', 191, 1, 9, 398838) Certainly we should provide all reasonable facilities to the refugees.
('98', 191, 1, 10, 398909) It will be shameful if we do not.
('98', 191, 1, 11, 398943) We should not be afraid or upset or angry over what has happened in Karachi.
('98', 191, 1, 12, 399020) In return we on our part should live peacefully.
('98', 191, 1, 13, 399069) If we can conduct ourselves decently, if we let the Muslims stay on, and if the refugees behave with civility, we shall soon overcome the present painful situation.

('98', 191, 6, 21, 399426) I have signed the budget.
('98', 191, 6, 22, 399452) I would like the Talimi Sangh to take over everything.
('98', 191, 6, 23, 399507) 2 It will be a test for you all.
('98', 191, 6, 24, 399540) If you do not master the art of taking work from other institutions it will be the end of all work.
('98', 191, 6, 25, 399640) If you are complacent and depend on my help you are likely to repent it.
('98', 191, 6, 26, 399713) How long can I live?
('98', 191, 6, 27, 399734) If you have the grace of God you have everything.
('98', 191, 6, 28, 399784) And I have already defined the condition for obtaining that grace.

('98', 192, 3, 5, 400234) ARYAM, I have your two letters.
('98', 192, 3, 6, 400266) You should find some time and improve your Hindustani and both the scripts.
('98', 192, 3, 7, 400342) If Asha is not there you should take the help of others who know Hindustani.
('98', 192, 3, 8, 400419) Why not Meetu’s 1 help?
('98', 192, 3, 9, 400443) I would like the Talimi Sangh to take up the work of the K. G. N. M. Trust as well.
('98', 192, 3, 10, 400527) It may be said that I am running a risk here.
('98', 192, 3, 11, 400573) It is for you, it is your duty, to see whether you can shoulder all the responsibility.
('98', 192, 3, 12, 400661) The co operation of all the institutions and people depends upon your tact and friendliness.
('98', 192, 3, 13, 400754) I can but obtain it for you; it is for you to carry it through and to develop it.
('98', 192, 3, 14, 400836) Do you understand what I am saying?
('98', 192, 3, 15, 400872) Ask me if you don’t.
('98', 192, 3, 16, 400893) You could even have written to me in Bengali.

('98', 192, 7, 24, 401174) I think it was no less than your good luck that you could serve Totaram 3. You are absolutely right that after the late Imam Saheb he was the lone elder in the Ashram.
('98', 192, 7, 25, 401342) Parikshitbhai had sent me a telegram.
('98', 192, 7, 26, 401380) Wahid 4 has indeed risen high.
('98', 192, 7, 27, 401411) If he works hard he is sure to forge ahead as you say.

('98', 193, 2, 3, 401950) January 8, 1948
('98', 193, 3, 4, 401966) KRISHNADAS1, It is quite correct that you should write in Hindustani.
('98', 193, 3, 5, 402036) I am, however, replying in Gujarati.
('98', 193, 3, 6, 402073) I am very glad that Manojna 7 co operates with you.
('98', 193, 3, 7, 402125) Seek more help from her if you can.
('98', 193, 3, 8, 402161) She can speedily improve her knowledge of Hindustani and of the two scripts.
('98', 193, 3, 9, 402238) Then why can’t we devote our entire attention to it?
('98', 193, 3, 10, 402291) All our [dealings] needs must be in Hindustani, not in Hindi or Urdu.
('98', 193, 3, 11, 402361) Hence I would not regard the expression nirvachit, which has been used in the resolution that we have passed, as Hindustani.
('98', 193, 3, 12, 402486) There must be a simpler equivalent for it.
('98', 193, 3, 13, 402529) If nirvachit means ‘one who has been elected’ why can’t we say chuna hua?
('98', 193, 3, 14, 402603) This is only by way of an illustration.
('98', 193, 3, 15, 402643) Why should the letter heads be in English any more?
('98', 193, 3, 16, 402695) My point was that it never ought to have been.
('98', 193, 3, 17, 402742) Anyway now we surely cannot have it, so all such letter heads should be utilized in some other way.
('98', 193, 3, 18, 402842) You can cut off the part carrying the print and get a rubber stamp for the name and address, or have them reprinted.
('98', 193, 3, 19, 402959) A third way is to score out the printed portions.
('98', 193, 3, 20, 403009) But that is a method I myself do not like.
('98', 193, 3, 21, 403052) Why should our constitution be in English?
('98', 193, 3, 22, 403095) It should be in beautiful Hindustani.
('98', 193, 3, 23, 403133) Even now we should have it rendered into Hindustani.
('98', 193, 4, 24, 403186) Now about Khadi Pratishthan.
('98', 193, 4, 25, 403215) An ordinary uncertified khadi bhandar defies us and carries on its business.
('98', 193, 4, 26, 403292) It competes with us.
('98', 193, 4, 27, 403313) What Khadi Pratishthan does is not with a view to competing with us; rather, whatever policy it adopts should help us to learn something.
('98', 193, 4, 28, 403451) If we look at it from this point of view I see a very great difference.
('98', 193, 4, 29, 403523) Even then we don’t propose to act in haste.
('98', 193, 4, 30, 403567) I am forwarding your letter to Hemprabhadevi.

('98', 194, 2, 3, 403952) January 8, 1948
('98', 194, 3, 4, 403968) Kakasaheb has been here for the last two days.
('98', 194, 3, 5, 404015) It was with the greatest difficulty that I could find time to talk to him about Hindustani and other things.
('98', 194, 3, 6, 404124) If he had not himself spoken he might have stayed on for weeks and I might not have found time to talk to him.
('98', 194, 3, 7, 404235) Innumerable people—men and women—visit me during the day.
('98', 194, 3, 8, 404293) There is a huge pile of letters to be attended to.
('98', 194, 3, 9, 404344) The work connected with Harijan has to be done.
('98', 194, 3, 10, 404392) There is not a moment to spare.
('98', 194, 3, 11, 404424) Usually Manu shaves me.
('98', 194, 3, 12, 404448) But today I have taken away this work from her.
('98', 194, 3, 13, 404496) I am lying in the bath, plying the razor and dictating this letter to Manu.
('98', 194, 3, 14, 404572) I am not as fit as I should be, which shows weakness of my faith in Ramanama.
('98', 194, 3, 15, 404650) 1should go to Rajkot.
('98', 194, 3, 16, 404672) By staying here he will only deceive himself and others.
('98', 194, 3, 17, 404729) Man is his own enemy.
('98', 194, 3, 18, 404751) No one can be the enemy of another.
('98', 194, 3, 19, 404787) Similarly, no one in the world can harm anyone.
('98', 194, 3, 20, 404835) You should give up the craving to live in the Ashram.
('98', 194, 3, 21, 404889) I have told the few people who are still there to stay there only if they can stand on their own feet.
('98', 194, 3, 22, 404992) I had never doubted that the removal of rationing would bring the relief it has brought.
('98', 194, 3, 23, 405081) The Government hesitated because they were afraid of hurting the vested interests.
('98', 194, 3, 24, 405164) But can a government be carried on in this way?
('98', 194, 3, 25, 405212) Nothing is certain about me.
('98', 194, 3, 26, 405241) There is still much fire smouldering here.

('98', 196, 3, 4, 407278) BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
('98', 196, 4, 5, 407300) A correspondent refers to what I had said about the Harijans and drinking.
('98', 196, 4, 6, 407375) 1 As a matter of fact it was not only Harijans I had mentioned but all others.
('98', 196, 4, 7, 407454) He asks if only Harijans should give up drinking, what about the soldiers and rich people?
('98', 196, 4, 8, 407545) It is a silly question.
('98', 196, 4, 9, 407569) If the rich do not give up drinking, does it mean that others too should not give it up?
('98', 196, 4, 10, 407658) Even if there is no prohibition drinking does not become a virtue.
('98', 196, 4, 11, 407725) Does it mean that if others sin we should also sin?
('98', 196, 4, 12, 407777) Since he has asked me I would tell him that all those who drink should give up the habit.
('98', 196, 4, 13, 407867) Since the Harijans and the labour class cannot be persuaded the law must persuade them.
('98', 196, 4, 14, 407955) They take to drink because they are deprived of other comforts of life.
('98', 196, 4, 15, 408027) They want to drown their poverty in drink.
('98', 196, 4, 16, 408070) But what reason can there be for the rich and the soldiers to drink?
('98', 196, 4, 17, 408139) It is not that all the soldiers drink.
('98', 196, 4, 18, 408178) Even among the English there are many who do not drink.
('98', 196, 4, 19, 408234) Everyone should give up drinking.
('98', 196, 4, 20, 408268) The law will apply to all.
('98', 196, 4, 21, 408295) It will not make any exception in favour of the rich.
('98', 196, 4, 22, 408349) I shall speak now of the students’ strike.
('98', 196, 4, 23, 408392) I understand that students who are Congress supporters will not join the strike.
('98', 196, 4, 24, 408473) It seems the strike was organized by the Communist students.
('98', 196, 4, 25, 408534) There are all types of students—Communist, Socialist and Congress supporters.
('98', 196, 4, 26, 408612) I am not concerned with that.
('98', 196, 4, 27, 408642) I am addressing them all.
('98', 196, 4, 28, 408668) If the Congress students are not taking part in the strike they deserve to be complimented.
('98', 196, 4, 29, 408760) I shall advise all the students not to go on strike.
('98', 196, 4, 30, 408813) It pains me that Communist students are taking this step.
('98', 196, 4, 31, 408871) Communists are clever people.
('98', 196, 4, 32, 408901) They too want to serve the country.
('98', 196, 4, 33, 408937) But this is not the way to serve the country.
('98', 196, 4, 34, 408983) And why should the students support any particular party?
('98', 196, 4, 35, 409041) The students form a party themselves.
('98', 196, 4, 36, 409079) Their job is to study not merely for themselves but for the service of the country.
('98', 196, 4, 37, 409163) So long as one is a student one is not a Communist, or a Socialist, or a Congressman.
('98', 196, 4, 38, 409249) One is merely a student devoted wholly to studies.
('98', 196, 4, 39, 409300) Strike for them will be fatal.
('98', 196, 4, 40, 409331) I have a question here.
('98', 196, 4, 41, 409355) It is a good question.

('98', 197, 1, 2, 409549) the same advice to Pakistan, why I do not go there and resort to satyagraha.
('98', 197, 1, 3, 409626) I have answered the question except for the satyagraha part.
('98', 197, 1, 4, 409687) How can I go to Pakistan so long as we are behaving here as they do in Pakistan?
('98', 197, 1, 5, 409768) I can only go to Pakistan after India has cleansed herself.
('98', 197, 1, 6, 409828) I will do or die here.
('98', 197, 1, 7, 409851) Hindus and Sikhs of Delhi have gone mad.
('98', 197, 1, 8, 409892) They want all the Muslims here to be driven out.
('98', 197, 1, 9, 409941) A large number have already gone.
('98', 197, 1, 10, 409975) They want the rest also to go.
('98', 197, 1, 11, 410006) There are Sikhs and Hindus in Pakistan who want to come away.
('98', 197, 1, 12, 410068) But what is the use of satyagraha today?
('98', 197, 1, 13, 410109) There is no satyagraha and no ahimsa left now.
('98', 197, 1, 14, 410156) Everyone has become a votary of violence.
('98', 197, 1, 15, 410198) They want the help of the army and can be happy only when they have such help.
('98', 197, 1, 16, 410277) Today armed force has replaced God.
('98', 197, 1, 17, 410313) Today even our newspapers are spreading filth.
('98', 197, 1, 18, 410360) If people would listen to me, the newspapers would present a very different picture.
('98', 197, 1, 19, 410445) The correspondent asks: “Since Hindus and Sikhs in such large numbers have been thrown out of Pakistan, where is the place for the Muslims to live?
('98', 197, 1, 20, 410593) And so long as the same number of Muslims do not leave India, where is the place for the refugees to occupy?” I think that the number of Muslims who have already left equals the number of Hindu and Sikh refugees from Pakistan.
('98', 197, 1, 21, 410820) It is madness to demand that the rest of them should also go because attempts are being made to drive out from Pakistan the Hindus and Sikhs still left there.
('98', 197, 1, 22, 410979) We still have large numbers of Muslims in India.
('98', 197, 1, 23, 411028) I am told that the meeting called by Maulana Azad in Lucknow was attended by 70,000 Muslims.
('98', 197, 1, 24, 411121) It was the largest number of Muslims who attended a meeting in recent times.
('98', 197, 1, 25, 411198) Must we kill all those Muslims or send them away to Pakistan, and why?
('98', 197, 1, 26, 411269) I shall never give such shameful advice.
('98', 197, 1, 27, 411310) There is no bravery in it.
('98', 197, 1, 28, 411337) A number of people from Bahawalpur came to see me today.
('98', 197, 1, 29, 411394) A few persons from Mirpur Kashmir also came.
('98', 197, 1, 30, 411439) They are obviously in great difficulty.
('98', 197, 1, 31, 411479) While they were still talking Panditji dropped in.
('98', 197, 1, 32, 411530) I asked him to hear what the visitors had to say.
('98', 197, 1, 33, 411580) The representatives of Mirpur had a talk with Panditji and I hope something will be done.
('98', 197, 1, 34, 411670) I do not say that all that they want will be done.
('98', 197, 1, 35, 411721) Although it is not yet a formal war, it is something very similar.
('98', 197, 1, 36, 411788) In the circumstances it will be difficult to find a way of bringing over all the people marooned there.
('98', 197, 1, 37, 411892) I am sure the Government will do what it can.
('98', 197, 1, 38, 411938) But if there are still some people left there who cannot be helped, there is nothing much we can do about it.
('98', 197, 1, 39, 412048) We do not have enough trains and buses.
('98', 197, 1, 40, 412088) The Kashmir road is not yet fit for transporting millions of people.
('98', 197, 1, 41, 412157) It is too narrow.

('98', 198, 1, 2, 412222) The Bahawalpur refugees told me that the other refugees could have their names registered for jobs and send in applications, but that all the applications of those coming from Bahawalpur were not being entertained.
('98', 198, 1, 3, 412437) They asked why there should be such discrimination.
('98', 198, 1, 4, 412489) They were very polite and reasonable.
('98', 198, 1, 5, 412527) They said that people coming from the Frontier Province, the Punjab and Sind could apply and were eligible for jobs.
('98', 198, 1, 6, 412644) I said this could not be true and if there was such discrimination against the refugees from Bahawalpur it must be a mistake.
('98', 198, 1, 7, 412770) The Sardar has said that there would not be any discrimination.
('98', 198, 1, 8, 412834) However, I shall find out.

('98', 199, 3, 4, 413491) Today this capital city is under a kind of siege.
('98', 199, 3, 5, 413541) Although India is free the capital of India is protected by the army and the police and I can do nothing but sit here and watch.
('98', 199, 3, 6, 413670) Votaries of non violence today have had to put their trust in the weapons of violence.
('98', 199, 3, 7, 413757) What a severe test it is going to be for us.
('98', 199, 3, 8, 413802) If this is God’s will, what strange design does it hide?
('98', 199, 3, 9, 413859) But I have to do or die.
('98', 199, 3, 10, 413884) Those who believe that arms can save Delhi are greatly mistaken.
('98', 199, 3, 11, 413949) Whether it be Delhi or the world only one thing can save us and that is heart amity.
('98', 199, 3, 12, 414034) I have no time at all.
('98', 199, 3, 13, 414057) There is a heap of letters to be answered.

('98', 199, 8, 19, 414237) AMRITA LAL, I have your letter.
('98', 199, 8, 20, 414269) I am glad that you wrote it in Hindustani in the Bengali script.
('98', 199, 8, 21, 414334) I think Dhiren is committing a mistake.
('98', 199, 8, 22, 414374) It is a good thing that the marriage is still far away.
('98', 199, 8, 23, 414430) He has a perfect right to act as he wants.
('98', 199, 8, 24, 414473) Blessings are unnecessary when the cause is good; they become a curse when the cause is bad.

('98', 200, 3, 4, 415173) DAUGHTER AMTUL SALAAM, Your letter is full of anger.
('98', 200, 3, 5, 415226) Anger seems to be the food on which you subsist.
('98', 200, 3, 6, 415275) My simplest statement seems crooked to you.
('98', 200, 3, 7, 415319) Let it be.
('98', 200, 3, 8, 415330) Can one help one’s nature?
('98', 200, 3, 9, 415357) I have never felt that you are a Muslim and I am a Hindu.
('98', 200, 3, 10, 415415) The only feeling I have is that you are A. S. and I am Gandhi.
('98', 200, 3, 11, 415478) Where our atmans are concerned we are one.
('98', 200, 3, 12, 415521) I hold that it is your duty to go to Borkamta.
('98', 200, 3, 13, 415568) No other question arises if you too believe the same.
('98', 200, 3, 14, 415622) It is imperative that you go to Borkamta soon.
('98', 200, 3, 15, 415669) In my view you are the moving spirit behind whatever has been achieved there.
('98', 200, 3, 16, 415747) It was and still is your most significant work.
('98', 200, 3, 17, 415795) Only you can sustain it.
('98', 200, 3, 18, 415820) At present no one but you can accomplish that work.
('98', 200, 3, 19, 415872) If you do not ask me for money, that too would be in your interest.
('98', 200, 3, 20, 415940) Nothing belongs to me; everything belongs to one or the other trust.

('98', 201, 2, 3, 416761) BIRLA HOUSE, NEW DELHI, January 9, 1948
('98', 201, 3, 4, 416801) What I want is that you should have Nanabhai as your counsellor, even as sage Vashishtha was in Ramarajya.
('98', 201, 3, 5, 416908) He will not shine more by being the Chief Minister.
('98', 201, 3, 6, 416960) When there is friction between the ruler and the subjects he can bring them together.
('98', 201, 3, 7, 417046) He should not transfer his institution 2 to the city.
('98', 201, 3, 8, 417100) He should continue it in Ambla.
('98', 201, 3, 9, 417132) I do not feel that Nanabhai will say no.
('98', 201, 3, 10, 417173) He will not fit too well in the seat of power.
('98', 201, 3, 11, 417220) His place can only be in the field of education.
('98', 201, 3, 12, 417269) If everyone becomes Chief Minister, who will make up the subjects?
('98', 201, 3, 13, 417336) Just as the ministers should be educated so also the people should be educated.
('98', 201, 3, 14, 417416) Only if the people are educated will they keep the ministers on their toes.
('98', 201, 3, 15, 417492) Only an educated people can discern the path to freedom.
('98', 201, 3, 16, 417549) My own view is that Balwantrai should be made Chief Minister.
('98', 201, 3, 17, 417611) He served the old Bhavnagar State for many years.
('98', 201, 3, 18, 417661) The qualities that Balwantrai has are not to be found in Nanabhai.
('98', 201, 3, 19, 417728) And Nanabhai’s qualities Balwantrai does not possess.
('98', 201, 3, 20, 417782) Dhebar alone cannot tackle the problems of Kathiawar.
('98', 201, 3, 21, 417836) If the entire Kathiawar has only these two I shall have no worry.
('98', 201, 3, 22, 417902) We cannot burden Dhebar alone with the responsibility of the whole of Kathiawar.
('98', 201, 3, 23, 417983) In the ceremony Pattani 3 should be kept in the forefront.
('98', 201, 3, 24, 418042) This is my considered view.
('98', 201, 3, 25, 418070) But if you invite him only to censure him, then you should not invite him.
('98', 201, 3, 26, 418145) If we start with prejudices of any kind we shall only frustrate our purpose.
('98', 201, 3, 27, 418222) You must learn from him.
('98', 201, 3, 28, 418247) There will be occasions when the State will be able to find a way through difficulties through his experience alone.
('98', 201, 3, 29, 418364) I am giving my opinion unsought.
('98', 201, 3, 30, 418397) If you do not like it you can reject it.
('98', 201, 3, 31, 418438) You should not think that you have to accept it because I say it.
('98', 201, 3, 32, 418504) If you do anything just to please me, it will not please me but it will harm us both.

('98', 202, 2, 3, 418977) NEW DELHI, January 9, 1948
('98', 202, 3, 4, 419004) BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
('98', 202, 4, 5, 419026) I want to say something about a Hindu temple in Bahawalpur.
('98', 202, 4, 6, 419086) It is still there but is no more in the possession of the Hindus.
('98', 202, 4, 7, 419152) The chief priest of the temple came to see me today.
('98', 202, 4, 8, 419205) His name is Bhagwandas.
('98', 202, 4, 9, 419229) He saw with his own eyes how the temple was attacked and how the Hindus ran for their lives by the backdoor.
('98', 202, 4, 10, 419338) The chief priest also ran away with them.
('98', 202, 4, 11, 419380) He described to me how he was able to save some women.
('98', 202, 4, 12, 419435) He could not save them all but quite a number were rescued.
('98', 202, 4, 13, 419495) He wants me to find a way of bringing over the Hindus still stranded there.
('98', 202, 4, 14, 419571) I told him that I was doing all that a single individual could do.
('98', 202, 4, 15, 419638) The Government was trying to do something but it was not easy because one Government should not interfere in the affairs of another.
('98', 202, 4, 16, 419771) I have said it before and I say it again that what is required at the present juncture is patience.
('98', 202, 4, 17, 419871) We should not fear death.
('98', 202, 4, 18, 419897) We must fear dishonour and indignity.
('98', 202, 4, 19, 419935) To save one’s honour one must lay down one’s life.
('98', 202, 4, 20, 419986) If someone is asked to embrace Islam or be prepared to die, he must choose death.
('98', 202, 4, 21, 420068) Death is inevitable and cannot be avoided for ever.
('98', 202, 4, 22, 420120) This of course does not mean that we should not do what we can to save ourselves but our ultimate trust should be in God.
('98', 202, 4, 23, 420242) A refugee came to see me today.
('98', 202, 4, 24, 420274) He was not a beggar, nor a poor man.
('98', 202, 4, 25, 420311) He has known prosperity.
('98', 202, 4, 26, 420336) He lives in a bungalow nearby.
('98', 202, 4, 27, 420367) The bungalow belonged to a Muslim who ran away.
('98', 202, 4, 28, 420415) The refugee friend was a friend of that Muslim.
('98', 202, 4, 29, 420463) He comes from the place where the Muslim has gone to settle.
('98', 202, 4, 30, 420524) He told him to go and live in his bungalow.
('98', 202, 4, 31, 420568) Now he says he has received a notice from the Government asking him to vacate the bungalow which is required for public purposes.
('98', 202, 4, 32, 420698) I have no doubt that the Government would requisition the house.
('98', 202, 4, 33, 420763) There are many people, ambassadors and others coming from outside and the Government would want to provide them proper accommodation.
('98', 202, 4, 34, 420897) After all the Government cannot put up new houses by magic.
('98', 202, 4, 35, 420957) It is said that sages had this power in former times.
('98', 202, 4, 36, 421011) It is related in the Ramayana how the sage Bharadwaja had made a whole city appear from nowhere with the power of his mantra.
('98', 202, 4, 37, 421137) Today I know of no such mantra.
('98', 202, 4, 38, 421169) I therefore can understand it if the Government requisitions houses when it wants them but it should then

('98', 203, 1, 2, 421317) provide alternative accommodation to the people living there.
('98', 203, 1, 3, 421379) If the Government just pushes out the occupants, where are they to go?
('98', 203, 1, 4, 421450) I am sure the Government cannot act thus.
('98', 203, 1, 5, 421492) But if such a notice has been received I cannot really hold out any assurance of help.
('98', 203, 1, 6, 421579) I myself do not have a house of my own.
('98', 203, 1, 7, 421619) I am living in another’s house.
('98', 203, 1, 8, 421651) The affected person should approach the Government.
('98', 203, 1, 9, 421703) I still think that what he says is not correct but if it is, it is a painful matter.
('98', 203, 1, 10, 421788) I know that anyone lawfully residing in a house cannot be served with such a notice.
('98', 203, 1, 11, 421873) I have several other letters.
('98', 203, 1, 12, 421903) A correspondent attributes to me the statement that in Bombay everyone was allowed to draw one seer of rice per day as his rationed quota.
('98', 203, 1, 13, 422042) So far as I remember I never said this.
('98', 203, 1, 14, 422082) In the present conditions of scarcity one seer of rice per day per head would be too liberal an allowance.
('98', 203, 1, 15, 422189) Still I shall see what I had said.
('98', 203, 1, 16, 422224) He says the quota is a quarter seer per head, per day.
('98', 203, 1, 17, 422279) This means one seer in four days.
('98', 203, 1, 18, 422313) This is not too bad.
('98', 203, 1, 19, 422334) But in fact I recollect it was only one seer in seven days.
('98', 203, 1, 20, 422394) But if I had said that the allowance was one seer per head per day it should be taken as incorrect.
('98', 203, 1, 21, 422494) There are so many notes and letters that I find it difficult to decide which one to take up.
('98', 203, 1, 22, 422587) One says that I am staying here in Birla House where poor people cannot enter; formerly when I was in Bhangi Colony poor people could approach me.
('98', 203, 1, 23, 422734) What he says is true and I like it.
('98', 203, 1, 24, 422770) I think I had referred to this the first time I came here.
('98', 203, 1, 25, 422829) 1 I came here at a time when Delhi was in the grip of communal rioting.
('98', 203, 1, 26, 422901) The town looked like a graveyard.
('98', 203, 1, 27, 422935) Bhangi Colony had also become crowded with refugees and it was feared that anything might happen anywhere.
('98', 203, 1, 28, 423042) So the Sardar said that he would not allow me to live there.
('98', 203, 1, 29, 423103) So they moved me to Birla House.
('98', 203, 1, 30, 423136) I did not object because after all I cannot make do with a room.
('98', 203, 1, 31, 423201) There had to be an office and a kitchen, and moreover there are many people living with me.
('98', 203, 1, 32, 423293) Here I am also within easy reach of the ministers.
('98', 203, 1, 33, 423344) They do not send for me.
('98', 203, 1, 34, 423369) They themselves come to me.
('98', 203, 1, 35, 423397) It is their kindness.
('98', 203, 1, 36, 423419) It takes them only two minutes to come here.
('98', 203, 1, 37, 423464) It took them 10 to 16 minutes to go to Bhangi Colony.
('98', 203, 1, 38, 423518) The Muslim brethren also find it easy to come here while they are scared of going to Bhangi Colony.
('98', 203, 1, 39, 423618) It will be a great thing if we can save such of them as are left.
('98', 203, 1, 40, 423684) Today goondaism rules the streets.
('98', 203, 1, 41, 423719) Anyone going on a bicycle is pulled down and his money or watch is snatched away.
('98', 203, 1, 42, 423801) Even those travelling in cars are stopped and

('98', 204, 5, 9, 424114) January 9, 1948
('98', 204, 6, 10, 424130) VIJAYA, It is after a long time that you seem to have found occasion to write to me.
('98', 204, 6, 11, 424215) I often think of you.
('98', 204, 6, 12, 424237) The answer to your question is the verse which we sing every day at the morning prayer.
('98', 204, 6, 13, 424325) The prayer, in its entirety, is meant not only to be recited but to be acted upon.
('98', 204, 6, 14, 424408) This is what the verse means: “Our misfortunes are not real misfortunes, nor are our good fortunes so in fact.
('98', 204, 6, 15, 424519) Real misfortune is the forgetting of Vishnu, and the highest wealth consists in constantly thinking of Him and trying to see Him in one’s heart.” Think over this and shed your weakness.
('98', 204, 6, 16, 424705) Why need one who feels Rama in his heart, bemoan massacres or lose his reason because of them?
('98', 204, 6, 17, 424800) And, moreover, what about the inhuman conduct we were guilty of on our side?
('98', 204, 6, 18, 424877) Hence did Narasimha sing: “Let not thy mind be affected by suffering or happiness, for they were created with the body.” Think over this.
('98', 204, 6, 19, 425015) I don’t like your being weak.
('98', 204, 6, 20, 425045) You should go to Panchgani.
('98', 204, 6, 21, 425073) Accommodation is available there now.
('98', 204, 6, 22, 425111) Uruli also is a fine place.
('98', 204, 6, 23, 425139) You should find some time for rest.
('98', 204, 6, 24, 425175) Nanabhai must have received my letter.
('98', 204, 7, 25, 425214) I have written this letter in great hurry, having put off going to bed for a while.
('98', 204, 7, 26, 425298) Look after the children with great care.

('98', 205, 3, 4, 425590) SHARDA, Harjivan having passed away, your highest good lies in acknowledging your faults when they are pointed out by others.
('98', 205, 3, 5, 425716) One may only praise the departed for his good qualities.
('98', 205, 3, 6, 425773) How can Dada 1
('98', 205, 4, 7, 425788) realize that even when I was finding fault with you I was only admiring your good qualities?
('98', 205, 4, 8, 425881) However, irrespective of what I did or did not tell him let me tell you one thing, that I greatly appreciate your strength of character, and as for Harjivan he was simply devoted to you.
('98', 205, 4, 9, 426068) He believed that whatever brahmacharya he could observe he did with the help of your strength of character.
('98', 205, 4, 10, 426176) He did not look upon it as a great achievement on his part.
('98', 205, 4, 11, 426236) It was therefore you who succumbed to his entreaties.
('98', 205, 4, 12, 426290) Thus you fell and brought him down with you.
('98', 205, 4, 13, 426335) If you never had any respect for brahmacharya, raising a family would have been regarded as the normal thing for you as for anyone else.
('98', 205, 4, 14, 426472) Only he can fall who has risen high.
('98', 205, 4, 15, 426509) I write all this so that you can be strong in future and may not feel dejected.
('98', 205, 4, 16, 426589) You should now devote yourself cheerfully to your own work and your own dharma, and conduct yourself as Dada advises.

('98', 205, 8, 21, 426827) BHAI GANGADHARRAO,
('98', 205, 9, 22, 426846) I have your letter.
('98', 205, 9, 23, 426866) I have always believed in the unification of Karnataka and have loved the idea.

('98', 205, 11, 28, 427414) It must be remembered that creation of new provinces would require careful consideration in all its bearings, so that any decision taken would be acceptable to the neighbouring provinces concerned.

('98', 206, 4, 7, 427940) NEW DELHI, January 10, 1948
('98', 206, 5, 8, 427968) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, It is shocking to see how we have fallen today.
('98', 206, 5, 9, 428038) Those who pretend to be sadhus and boast of self control and their recitation of the Gita, show no self control at all.
('98', 206, 5, 10, 428158) 1 But generally these days the prayer meetings are quiet and well ordered, which is a good thing.
('98', 206, 5, 11, 428256) I had been warned that the Bahawalpur refugees would create a disturbance today and would keep on shouting through the meeting.
('98', 206, 6, 12, 428384) I said it could not be true.
('98', 206, 6, 13, 428413) I know their sufferings.
('98', 206, 6, 14, 428438) I assure them that all the Hindus and Sikhs stranded there will be brought over.
('98', 206, 6, 15, 428519) The Nawab has given the assurance—although I do not know how much one can depend on the assurances of Rajas and Nawabs— that from now on Hindus and Sikhs there will not be subjected to any harassment, that those who want to leave will be allowed to leave under proper arrangements and those remaining will not be asked to embrace Islam.
('98', 206, 6, 16, 428856) It may be that they are all safe there.
('98', 206, 6, 17, 428896) The Government too are seized of the matter.
('98', 206, 6, 18, 428941) You may demand that they should be brought over right now.
('98', 206, 6, 19, 429000) But you must understand that, though formerly we were one country, we are now two countries and enemies of each other.
('98', 206, 6, 20, 429119) We try to do what we can.
('98', 206, 6, 21, 429145) There are seventy thousand Hindus and Sikhs there.
('98', 206, 6, 22, 429196) In Sind the number is much larger.
('98', 206, 6, 23, 429231) They are not safe there.
('98', 206, 6, 24, 429256) I have a telegram from Karachi which says that the situation is much worse than it was described in the newspapers and that the damage done was much greater.
('98', 206, 6, 25, 429414) The times are such that we must maintain the utmost self possession and patience.
('98', 206, 6, 26, 429496) If we lose patience we shall lose the battle.
('98', 206, 6, 27, 429542) Defeat is a word that should find no
('98', 206, 7, 28, 429579) 1 A man wearing a saffron robe had got up and insisted on reading out his letter to Gandhiji.
('98', 206, 7, 29, 429673) It was with great difficulty that he was made to sit down.
('98', 206, 7, 30, 429732) 2 As Gandhiji walked to the prayer ground, the refugees from Bahawalpur staged a demonstration and shouted slogans asking for help for the 70,000 Hindus and Sikhs stranded there.
('98', 206, 7, 31, 429911) They became perfectly peaceful when Gandhiji sat down for prayers.

('98', 207, 1, 4, 430101) We have to think calmly what we must do.
('98', 207, 1, 5, 430142) Today the Iranian Ambassador came to see me.
('98', 207, 1, 6, 430187) He is a guest of the Government.
('98', 207, 1, 7, 430220) He said, “Iran and India have always been friends.
('98', 207, 1, 8, 430271) Both Iranians and Indians come of Aryan stock.” He is right.
('98', 207, 1, 9, 430332) If we look at the Zend Avesta, we shall find many Sanskrit words in it.
('98', 207, 1, 10, 430404) We have also had dealings with each other.
('98', 207, 1, 11, 430447) The Ambassador said that India was the largest nation in Asia and that Iran sincerely wanted friendship with India.
('98', 207, 1, 12, 430563) Gurudev 1 had once paid a visit to Iran and he was very satisfied with the visit.
('98', 207, 1, 13, 430645) The Ambassador told me that the relations between Iran and India ought not to be allowed to deteriorate.
('98', 207, 1, 14, 430750) I asked him how that could be.
('98', 207, 1, 15, 430781) Then he referred to an incident involving an Iranian in Bombay.
('98', 207, 1, 16, 430845) There are many Iranians in Bombay.
('98', 207, 1, 17, 430880) They run tea shops there, which are visited by large numbers of Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and Christians.
('98', 207, 1, 18, 430984) There seems to have been some rioting there.
('98', 207, 1, 19, 431029) I do not know anything about it.
('98', 207, 1, 20, 431062) I am told some Iranians were killed.
('98', 207, 1, 21, 431099) Iranians are after all Muslims.
('98', 207, 1, 22, 431131) So the rioters must have decided that it was quite all right to kill them.
('98', 207, 1, 23, 431206) I asked him if he had any complaint to make about the way the Government handled the situation.
('98', 207, 1, 24, 431302) He said he had none and that the Government had quickly brought the situation under control.
('98', 207, 1, 25, 431395) He says the Government here too is good, that it has posted armed guards for the protection of the Muslims who are here.
('98', 207, 1, 26, 431516) He says in Iran Hindu, Sikh and Muslim traders lived together in amity.
('98', 207, 1, 27, 431588) Exaggerated reports from India are always going there.
('98', 207, 1, 28, 431643) What may happen in future nobody knows.
('98', 207, 1, 29, 431683) But the Government in Iran is keeping itself vigilant, and it does not want to weaken its friendship with India for whatever cause.
('98', 207, 1, 30, 431815) I still have two minutes, so I take up a letter.
('98', 207, 1, 31, 431864) The correspondent says that, though some people are happy that the controls on articles of food have been lifted, he would like to warn me that lifting of controls has not been a very good thing and that I have only been getting one sided information.
('98', 207, 1, 32, 432116) But when I receive so many wires and letters congratulating me, what am I to say?
('98', 207, 1, 33, 432198) I cannot reject them saying that they present only one view.
('98', 207, 1, 34, 432259) I cannot know the opinions of all and I cannot see everything that is happening in the world because I am not gifted with divine sight.
('98', 207, 1, 35, 432395) The millions of people in India are my eyes and ears, hands and feet.

('98', 208, 5, 11, 432877) Two weeks ago I hinted in the Gujarati columns that the Harijan printed in the Urdu script was likely to be stopped as its sale was steadily dwindling.
('98', 208, 5, 12, 433029) Apart even from financial considerations, I saw no meaning in publishing it, if there was no demand for it.
('98', 208, 5, 13, 433137) The dwindle to me was a sign of resentment against its publication.
('98', 208, 5, 14, 433205) I would be foolish if I failed to profit by it.
('98', 208, 5, 15, 433253) My view remains unalterable especially at this critical juncture in our history.
('98', 208, 5, 16, 433334) It is wrong to ruffle Muslim or any other person’s feeling when there is no question of ethics.
('98', 208, 5, 17, 433430) Those who take the trouble of learning the Urdu script in addition to the Nagari, will surely lose nothing.
('98', 208, 5, 18, 433538) They will gain a knowledge of the Urdu script, which many of our countrymen know.
('98', 208, 5, 19, 433620) If it was not for cussedness, this proposition will be admitted without any argument.
('98', 208, 5, 20, 433706) The limitations of this script in terms of perfection are many.
('98', 208, 5, 21, 433770) But for elegance and grace it will equal any script in the world.
('98', 208, 5, 22, 433836) It will not die so long at least as Arabic and Persian live, though it has achieved a status all its own without outside aid.
('98', 208, 5, 23, 433962) With a little adaptation it can serve the purpose of shorthand.
('98', 208, 5, 24, 434026) As a national script, if it is set free from the bondage of orthodoxy, it is capable of improvement so as to enable one to transcribe Sanskrit verses without the slightest difficulty.
('98', 208, 5, 25, 434210) Lastly, those who in anger boycott the Urdu script, put a wanton affront upon the Muslims of the Union who, in the eyes of many Hindus, have become aliens in their own land.
('98', 208, 5, 26, 434384) This is copying the bad manners of Pakistan with a vengeance.
('98', 208, 5, 27, 434446) I invite every inhabitant of India to join me in a stern refusal to copy bad manners.
('98', 208, 5, 28, 434532) If they will enter the heart of what I have written, they will prevent the impending collapse of the Nagari and Urdu editions of the Harijan.
('98', 208, 5, 29, 434674) Will Muslim friends rise to the occasion and do two things—subscribe to the Urdu edition and diligently learn the Nagari script and enrich their intellectual capital?

('98', 209, 1, 2, 434932) 223. HOW DEMOCRACY WORKS
('98', 209, 2, 3, 434957) A valued correspondent has written to me two letters, one issuing a timely warning about the ill effects of hasty decontrol and the other about the possibility of an outbreak of Hindu Muslim riots.
('98', 209, 2, 4, 435155) I have dealt with both the letters in a letter which has become unexpectedly argumentative and gives my view of democracy which can only come out of non violent mass action.
('98', 209, 2, 5, 435329) I, therefore, reproduce the letter below without giving at the same time the letters to which it is in answer.
('98', 209, 2, 6, 435440) There is enough in the answer to enable the reader to know the purport of the two letters.
('98', 209, 2, 7, 435531) I have purposely refrained from giving the name of my correspondent and the scene of action, not because the letters are confidential, but because nothing is to be gained from disclosing either: You still write as if you had the slave mind, though the slavery of us all is abolished.
('98', 209, 2, 8, 435815) If decontrol has produced the effect you attribute to it, you should raise your voice, even though you may be alone in doing so and your voice may be feeble.
('98', 209, 2, 9, 435973) As a matter of fact you have many companions and your voice is by no means feeble unless intoxication of power has enfeebled it.
('98', 209, 2, 10, 436102) Personally, the bogey of the shooting up of prices by reason of decontrol does not frighten me.
('98', 209, 2, 11, 436198) If we have many sharks and we do not know how to combat them, we shall deserve to be eaten up by them.
('98', 209, 2, 12, 436301) Then we shall know how to carry ourselves in the teeth of adversity.
('98', 209, 2, 13, 436370) Real democracy people learn not from books, not from the government who are in name and in reality their servants.
('98', 209, 2, 14, 436485) Hard experience is the most efficient teacher in democracy.
('98', 209, 2, 15, 436545) The days of appeals to me are gone.
('98', 209, 2, 16, 436581) The cloak of non violence which we had put on during the British regime is no longer now necessary.
('98', 209, 2, 17, 436681) Therefore, violence faces us in its terrible nakedness.
('98', 209, 2, 18, 436737) Have you also succumbed or you too never had non violence?
('98', 209, 2, 19, 436796) This letter is not to warn you against writing to me and giving me your view of the picture, but it is intended to tell you why I would swear by decontrol even if mine was a solitary voice.
('98', 209, 2, 20, 436986) Your second letter about Hindu Muslim tension is more to the point than the first.
('98', 209, 2, 21, 437069) Here too you should raise your voice openly against any soft handling of the situation or smug satisfaction.
('98', 209, 2, 22, 437178) I shall do my part but I am painfully conscious of my limitations.
('98', 209, 2, 23, 437245) Formerly I could afford to be the monarch of all

('98', 210, 1, 2, 437341) I surveyed.
('98', 210, 1, 3, 437353) Today I have many fellow monarchs, if I may still count myself as such.
('98', 210, 1, 4, 437425) If I can, I am the least among them.
('98', 210, 1, 5, 437462) The first days of democracy are discordant notes which jar on the ear and give you many headaches.
('98', 210, 1, 6, 437561) If democracy is to live in spite of these killing notes, sweet concord has to rise out of this seemingly discordant necessary lesson.
('98', 210, 1, 7, 437695) How I wish that you would be one of the masters who would contribute to the production of concord out of discord!
('98', 210, 1, 8, 437809) You will not make the mistake of thinking that your duty is finished when you have apprised me of the situation in your part of the country.

('98', 210, 4, 11, 438027) Bhai Harilal Bawabhai Patel of Gram Dakshinamurty writes: 1
('98', 210, 5, 12, 438087) There is nothing new in Bhai Harilal’s suggestion.
('98', 210, 5, 13, 438138) Nevertheless, those who hold the reins of the country are no farmers.
('98', 210, 5, 14, 438208) So what has been said above can be of help.
('98', 210, 5, 15, 438252) Let us find time from political activities and engage ourselves in constructive work, give proper importance to agricultural reforms, teach the farmers as much as possible and learn from them what we can.
('98', 210, 5, 16, 438457) If we use farmyard manure or compost it is not necessary to keep the fields fallow.
('98', 210, 5, 17, 438541) This manure keeps the soil ever fresh.
('98', 210, 5, 18, 438580) It also does not have to be carried from place to place.
('98', 210, 5, 19, 438637) After a little ex perience, such manure can be produced in every village.
('98', 210, 5, 20, 438711) But these things cannot be done mechanically.
('98', 210, 5, 21, 438757) Let us glean what knowledge we can find in writings such as above and provide right education to the farmers by carrying on original experiments, and thus benefit them.

('98', 211, 13, 21, 439876) BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
('98', 211, 14, 22, 439898) Only yesterday I complimented you on the calm you maintained in the meeting.
('98', 211, 14, 23, 439975) But if boys and girls continue to whisper or if women bring children who cry it is not good education for
('98', 211, 15, 24, 440081) 1 One word is illegible here.
('98', 212, 0, 1, 440111) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 213
('98', 212, 1, 2, 440158) 1 If they cannot keep the children quiet they should not bring them to the meeting.
('98', 212, 1, 3, 440242) I shall request all my brothers and sisters to have the decency to keep quiet and also to keep the children quiet.
('98', 212, 1, 4, 440357) Continuous conversation during prayer obstructs it.
('98', 212, 1, 5, 440409) They should realize that God is omnipotent and omnipresent.
('98', 212, 1, 6, 440469) He hears everything.
('98', 212, 1, 7, 440490) We must not abuse His silence and mercy.
('98', 212, 1, 8, 440531) I have to refer to a painful matter.
('98', 212, 1, 9, 440568) It concerns Andhra.
('98', 212, 1, 10, 440588) I have two letters from Andhra.
('98', 212, 1, 11, 440620) One of them is from an elderly gentleman 2
('98', 212, 2, 12, 440663) whom I know and who does not write as a rule.
('98', 212, 2, 13, 440709) The other is from a young man whom I do not know.
('98', 212, 2, 14, 440759) There is no use telling you the names because you do not know them.
('98', 212, 2, 15, 440827) Both say that after August 15, all fear has vanished from people’s minds.
('98', 212, 2, 16, 440901) The British who were feared are gone.
('98', 212, 2, 17, 440939) There is no fear of punishment and also no fear of God.
('98', 212, 2, 18, 440995) In Andhra people are of robust health and when they feel that they are free they lose all self control.
('98', 212, 2, 19, 441099) Now they do nothing but what will further their self interest.
('98', 212, 2, 20, 441162) One of the correspondents bewails the fact that all the sacrifices made by the Congress to see India free has resulted in this.
('98', 212, 2, 21, 441290) The Congress today is falling.
('98', 212, 2, 22, 441321) Everyone in the Congress today wants to become an M. L. A. Those who succeed do not work for the country but only for themselves.
('98', 212, 2, 23, 441451) An M. L. A. gets quite a sizable salary—I do not recollect how much—but it is quite adequate for one’s necessities.
('98', 212, 2, 24, 441567) The correspondent says that the M. L. As nevertheless are corrupt and they harass civil servants and try to browbeat them into doing their bidding.
('98', 212, 2, 25, 441715) In this way both suffer morally— civil servants as well as those who call themselves our representatives.
('98', 212, 2, 26, 441821) The elder correspondent suggests that I should go and live in Andhra and see how things are.
('98', 212, 2, 27, 441914) But I have lived not only among Andhras but among all classes of people.
('98', 212, 2, 28, 441987) To me people of every province are Indians even if they speak different languages.
('98', 212, 2, 29, 442070) If someone says that he belongs to Andhra and has nothing to do with the rest of the country, I too shall have nothing to do with him.
('98', 212, 2, 30, 442205) He says the rot is spreading amongst us.
('98', 212, 2, 31, 442246) The more people we return to the assemblies, the greater the amount of filth.
('98', 212, 2, 32, 442324) The fewer there are the less filth there will be.
('98', 212, 2, 33, 442374) He therefore suggests that we should reduce the number of M. L. A.s because they do not in any case represent the people.
('98', 212, 2, 34, 442496) They go into the assemblies to serve their self interest.
('98', 212, 3, 35, 442554) 1 It being a Sunday, a large number of people attended the prayer meeting.

('98', 213, 1, 2, 442785) even try to capture the Congress.
('98', 213, 1, 3, 442819) Then there are others who call themselves Communists or Socialists.
('98', 213, 1, 4, 442887) They also feel all important and talk about capturing the whole of India.
('98', 213, 1, 5, 442961) But who will control India?
('98', 213, 1, 6, 442989) Socialists and Communists and Congressmen are all Indians.
('98', 213, 1, 7, 443048) Let us not say that India is ours.
('98', 213, 1, 8, 443083) Let us rather say that we belong to India.
('98', 213, 1, 9, 443126) If we make India our own, we must do so not to further our self interest, not to enrich our relatives or to provide them jobs but to serve.
('98', 213, 1, 10, 443266) The women are talking.
('98', 213, 1, 11, 443289) This is very bad.
('98', 213, 1, 12, 443307) If you must talk, then come to the dais and make a speech from here.
('98', 213, 1, 13, 443376) Maybe they do not hear a word of what I am saying.
('98', 213, 1, 14, 443427) They do not come here to listen.
('98', 213, 1, 15, 443460) They come here because they have nothing else to do.
('98', 213, 1, 16, 443513) A few Muslims came to see me today.
('98', 213, 1, 17, 443549) They say they have been and still are nationalist Muslims and Congressmen.
('98', 213, 1, 18, 443624) They say formerly Congressmen had great regard for them but now they have fallen in their eyes.
('98', 213, 1, 19, 443720) If the Congressmen think so little of them, they should ask them to go and they will go.
('98', 213, 1, 20, 443809) Let the Government say so, too.
('98', 213, 1, 21, 443841) In that way they will be spared the assaults and the humiliation that are their lot.
('98', 213, 1, 22, 443926) Those who met me did not speak only for themselves.
('98', 213, 1, 23, 443978) They represented all the Muslims.
('98', 213, 1, 24, 444012) I advised them to keep calm and assured them that the Government was doing all it could.
('98', 213, 1, 25, 444101) We would see what to do if it failed.
('98', 213, 1, 26, 444139) Today we must forget that we are Hindus or Sikhs or Muslims or Parsis.
('98', 213, 1, 27, 444210) If we want to conduct the affairs of India properly we must be only Indians.
('98', 213, 1, 28, 444287) It is of no consequence by what name we call God in our homes.
('98', 213, 1, 29, 444350) In the work of the nation, all Indians of all faiths are one.
('98', 213, 1, 30, 444412) If Hindus say that they will kill Muslims or will not permit them to live in India they will be committing suicide and the Muslims will be spared the trouble of killing the Hindus.
('98', 213, 1, 31, 444593) We cannot commit suicide.
('98', 213, 1, 32, 444619) We are Indians and we must lay down our lives in protecting Hindus, Muslims, Parsis, Sikhs and all others.

('98', 214, 1, 2, 445133) horse races and all their attendant excitement.
('98', 214, 1, 3, 445181) They pander to the vices of humanity and mean a waste of good cultivable soil and good money.
('98', 214, 1, 4, 445275) Who has not witnessed as I have, the ruin of fine men caused by the gamble on the racecourses?
('98', 214, 1, 5, 445370) It is time to leave alone the vices of the West and to strive to adopt the best that it has to give.

('98', 214, 5, 9, 445549) Totaramji has passed away at a ripe old age without requiring any nursing.
('98', 214, 5, 10, 445624) He was a jewel of the Sabarmati Ashram.
('98', 214, 5, 11, 445664) Though not a scholar, he had wisdom.
('98', 214, 5, 12, 445701) He had a treasure of devotional songs and yet he was not an accomplished singer.
('98', 214, 5, 13, 445782) He used to delight the Ashram by his ektara 1 and his devotional songs.
('98', 214, 5, 14, 445854) His wife was exactly like him.
('98', 214, 5, 15, 445885) She departed before Totaramji.
('98', 214, 5, 16, 445916) Where people live in groups there are bound to be some conflicts.
('98', 214, 5, 17, 445982) I do not remember any occasion when this couple might have been a party to any such conflict or the cause of one.
('98', 214, 5, 18, 446096) Totaramji loved the soil.
('98', 214, 5, 19, 446122) Farming was his very life.
('98', 214, 5, 20, 446149) He came to the Ashram years ago and never left it.
('98', 214, 5, 21, 446200) Men and women, young and old, always sought his guidance.
('98', 214, 5, 22, 446258) He brought unfailing solace to them.
('98', 214, 5, 23, 446295) He was an orthodox Hindu.
('98', 214, 5, 24, 446321) But, he held Hindus, Muslims and people of other religions in equal regard.
('98', 214, 5, 25, 446397) There was no trace of the feeling of untouchability in him.
('98', 214, 5, 26, 446457) He had no vices.
('98', 214, 5, 27, 446474) He never took part in politics, and yet his love for the country was so great that it could be compared with the best of its kind.
('98', 214, 5, 28, 446605) Renunciation came to him naturally.
('98', 214, 5, 29, 446641) He added lustre to it.
('98', 214, 5, 30, 446664) This good man had gone to Fiji as an indentured labourer.
('98', 214, 5, 31, 446722) He was the discovery of Deenabandhu Andrews.
('98', 214, 5, 32, 446767) The credit for having brought him to the Ashram goes to Benarsidas Chaturvedi.
('98', 214, 5, 33, 446846) Till the end of his life it was Amina, Ghulam Rasool Qureshi’s wife and Imam Saheb’s daughter, who rendered him what service she could.

('98', 217, 5, 7, 449340) NEW DELHI, January 12, 1948
('98', 217, 6, 8, 449368) One fasts for health’s sake under laws governing health or fasts as a penance for a wrong done and felt as such.
('98', 217, 6, 9, 449481) In these fasts, the fasting one need not believe in ahimsa.
('98', 217, 6, 10, 449541) There is, however, a fast which a votary of non violence sometimes feels impelled to undertake by way of protest against some wrong done by society and this he does when he, as a votary of ahimsa, has no other remedy left.
('98', 217, 6, 11, 449764) Such an occasion has come my way.
('98', 217, 6, 12, 449798) When on September 9 I returned to Delhi from Calcutta, I was to proceed to West Punjab.
('98', 217, 6, 13, 449886) But that was not to be.
('98', 217, 6, 14, 449910) Gay Delhi looked a city of the dead.
('98', 217, 6, 15, 449947) As I alighted from the train I observed gloom on every face.
('98', 217, 6, 16, 450008) I saw even the Sardar, whom humour and the joy that humour gives never desert, was no exception this time.
('98', 217, 6, 17, 450115) The cause of it I did not know.
('98', 217, 6, 18, 450147) He was on the platform to receive me.
('98', 217, 6, 19, 450185) He lost no time in giving me the sad news of the disturbances that had taken place in the metropolis of the Union.
('98', 217, 6, 20, 450300) At once I saw that I had to be in Delhi and do or die.
('98', 217, 6, 21, 450355) There is apparent calm brought about by prompt military and police action.
('98', 217, 6, 22, 450430) But there is storm within the breast.
('98', 217, 6, 23, 450468) It may burst forth any day.
('98', 217, 6, 24, 450496) This I count as no fulfilment of the vow to “do” which alone can keep me from death, the incomparable friend.
('98', 217, 6, 25, 450606) I yearn for heart friendship between Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims.
('98', 217, 6, 26, 450670) It subsisted between them the other day.
('98', 217, 6, 27, 450711) Today it is non existent.
('98', 217, 6, 28, 450737) It is a state that
('98', 217, 7, 29, 450756) 1 As Gandhiji was observing silence, his speech written in English was translated into Hindi and read out after the prayers.
('98', 218, 0, 1, 450881) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 219
('98', 218, 1, 2, 450928) no Indian patriot worthy of the name can contemplate with equanimity.
('98', 218, 1, 3, 450998) Though the voice within has been beckoning for a long time, I have been shutting my ears to it lest it might be the voice of Satan, otherwise called my weakness.
('98', 218, 1, 4, 451160) I never like to feel resourceless; a satyagrahi never should.
('98', 218, 1, 5, 451222) Fasting is his last resort in the place of the sword—his or others.
('98', 218, 1, 6, 451290) I have no answer to return to the Muslim friends who see me from day to day as to what they should do.
('98', 218, 1, 7, 451393) My impotence has been gnawing at me of late.
('98', 218, 1, 8, 451438) It will go immediately the fast is undertaken.
('98', 218, 1, 9, 451485) I have been brooding over it for the last three days.
('98', 218, 1, 10, 451539) The final conclusion has flashed upon me and it makes me happy.
('98', 218, 1, 11, 451603) 1 No man, if he is pure, has anything more precious to give than his life.
('98', 218, 1, 12, 451678) I hope and pray that I have that purity in me to justify the step.
('98', 218, 1, 13, 451745) I ask you all to bless the effort and to pray for me and with me.
('98', 218, 1, 14, 451811) The fast begins from the first meal tomorrow (Tuesday).
('98', 218, 1, 15, 451867) The period is indefinite and I may drink water with or without salts and sour limes.
('98', 218, 1, 16, 451952) It will end when and if I am satisfied that there is a reunion of hearts of all communities brought about without any outside pressure, but from an awakened sense of duty.
('98', 218, 1, 17, 452124) The reward will be the regaining of India’s dwindling prestige and her fast fading sovereignty over the heart of Asia and therethrough the world.
('98', 218, 1, 18, 452270) I flatter myself with the belief that the loss of her soul by India will mean the loss of the hope of the aching, storm tossed and hungry world.
('98', 218, 1, 19, 452415) Let no friend or foe, if there be one, be angry with me.
('98', 218, 1, 20, 452472) There are friends who do not believe in the method of the fast for reclamation of the human mind.
('98', 218, 1, 21, 452570) They will bear with me and extend to me the same liberty of action that they claim for themselves.
('98', 218, 1, 22, 452669) With God as my supreme and sole counsellor, I felt that I must take the decision without any other adviser.
('98', 218, 1, 23, 452777) If I have made a mistake and discover it, I shall have no hesitation in proclaiming it from the house top and retracing my faulty step.
('98', 218, 1, 24, 452913) There is little chance of my making such a discovery.
('98', 218, 1, 25, 452967) If there is a clear indication, as I claim there is, of the Inner Voice, it will not be gainsaid.
('98', 218, 1, 26, 453065) I plead for all absence of argument and inevitable endorsement of the step.
('98', 218, 1, 27, 453141) If the whole of India
('98', 218, 2, 28, 453163) 1 Gandhiji had given no inkling of what was in his mind to his close associates—not even to Vallabhbhai Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru who had met him shortly before this announcement at the prayer meeting.
('98', 218, 2, 29, 453366) This was the fifteenth fast to be undertaken by Gandhiji.
('98', 219, 0, 1, 453424) 220 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 219, 1, 2, 453466) responds or at least Delhi does, the fast might be soon ended.
('98', 219, 1, 3, 453529) But whether it ends soon or late or never, let there be no softness in dealing with what may be termed as a crisis.
('98', 219, 1, 4, 453645) Critics have regarded some of my previous fasts as coercive and held that on merits the verdict would have gone against my stand but for the pressure exercised by the fasts.
('98', 219, 1, 5, 453819) What value can an adverse verdict have when the purpose is demonstrably sound?
('98', 219, 1, 6, 453898) A pure fast, like duty, is its own reward.
('98', 219, 1, 7, 453941) I do not embark upon it for the sake of the result it may bring.
('98', 219, 1, 8, 454006) I do so because I must.
('98', 219, 1, 9, 454030) Hence I urge everybody dispassionately to examine the purpose and let me die, if I must, in peace which I hope is ensured.
('98', 219, 1, 10, 454153) Death for me would be a glorious deliverance rather than that I should be a helpless witness of the destruction of India, Hinduism, Sikhism and Islam.
('98', 219, 1, 11, 454304) That destruction is certain if Pakistan does not ensure equality of status and security of life and property for all professing the various faiths of the world and if India copies her.
('98', 219, 1, 12, 454489) Only then Islam dies in the two Indias, not in the world.
('98', 219, 1, 13, 454547) But Hinduism and Sikhism have no world outside India.
('98', 219, 1, 14, 454601) Those who differ from me will be honoured by me for their resistance however implacable.
('98', 219, 1, 15, 454690) Let my fast quicken conscience, not deaden it.
('98', 219, 1, 16, 454737) Just contemplate the rot that has set in in beloved India and you will rejoice to think that there is an humble son of hers who is strong enough and possibly pure enough to take the happy step.
('98', 219, 1, 17, 454931) If he is neither, he is a burden on earth.
('98', 219, 1, 18, 454974) The sooner he disappears and clears the Indian atmosphere of the burden, the better for him and all concerned.
('98', 219, 1, 19, 455085) I would beg of all friends not to rush to Birla House nor try to dissuade me or be anxious for me.
('98', 219, 1, 20, 455184) I am in God’s hands.
('98', 219, 1, 21, 455205) Rather they should turn the searchlight inwards, for this is essentially a testing time for all of us.
('98', 219, 1, 22, 455308) Those who remain at their post of duty and perform it diligently and well, now more so than hitherto, will help me and the cause in every way.
('98', 219, 1, 23, 455451) The fast is a process of self purification.
('98', 219, 1, 24, 455495) I told you yesterday of two letters from Andhra.
('98', 219, 1, 25, 455544) One was from the aged friend, no other than Deshabhakta Konda Venkatappayyagaru.
('98', 219, 1, 26, 455625) I give here extracts from it:
('98', 219, 2, 27, 455655) The one great problem, apart from many other political and economic issues of a very complicated nature, is the moral degradation into which the men in Congress circles have fallen.
('98', 219, 2, 28, 455837) I cannot say much about other provinces but in my province the conditions are very deplorable.
('98', 219, 2, 29, 455932) The taste of political
('98', 220, 0, 1, 455955) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 221
('98', 220, 1, 2, 456002) power has turned their heads.
('98', 220, 1, 3, 456032) Several of the M. L. A.s and M. L. C.s are following the policy of making hay while the sun shines, of making money by the use of influence, even to the extent of obstructing the administration of justice in the criminal courts presided over by magistrates.
('98', 220, 1, 4, 456290) Even the District Collectors and other revenue officials do not feel free in the discharge of their duties on account of the frequent interference by the M. L. A.s and M. L. C.s on behalf of their partisans.
('98', 220, 1, 5, 456498) A strict and honest officer cannot hold his position, for false reports are carried against him to the Ministers who easily lend their ears to these unprincipled self seekers.
('98', 220, 2, 6, 456674) Swaraj was the only all absorbing passion which goaded men and women to follow your leadership.
('98', 220, 2, 7, 456770) But now that the goal had been reached, all moral restrictions have lost their power on most of the fighters in the great struggle, who are joining hands even with those who were sworn opponents of the national movement and who, now, for their personal ends enlist themselves as Congress members.
('98', 220, 2, 8, 457067) The situation is growing intolerable every day with the result that the Congress as well as the Congress Government have come into disrepute.
('98', 220, 3, 9, 457209) The recent municipal elections in Andhra have proved how far and how fast the Congress is losing its hold upon the people.
('98', 220, 3, 10, 457332) The municipal elections in the town of Guntur were suddenly ordered to be stopped by an urgent message from the Minister for Local Bodies (Madras) after every preparation was made for carrying on election.
('98', 220, 3, 11, 457538) Only a nominated council was in power for, I believe, the last ten years or more and for nearly a year now the municipal administration has been in the hands of a commissioner.
('98', 220, 3, 12, 457715) Now the talk prevails that the Government would soon nominate councillors to take charge of the municipal affairs of this town.
('98', 220, 4, 13, 457843) I, old, decrepit, with a broken leg, slowly limping on crutches within the walls of my house, have no axe to grind.
('98', 220, 4, 14, 457959) I no doubt entertain certain strong views against some of the leading Congressmen in the two parties into which the members of the Provincial and District Congress Committees now stand divided.
('98', 220, 4, 15, 458153) And I have made no secret of my views.
('98', 220, 5, 16, 458192) The factions in the Congress circles, the money making activities of several of the M. L. A.s and M. L. C.s and the weakness of the Ministers have been creating a rebellious spirit among the people at large.
('98', 220, 5, 17, 458400) The people have begun to say that the British Government was much better and they are even cursing the Congress.
('98', 220, 5, 18, 458513) Let the people of Andhra and the other provinces measure the words of this self sacrificing servant of India.
('98', 220, 5, 19, 458623) As he rightly says the corruption described by him is no monopoly of Andhra.
('98', 220, 5, 20, 458700) He could

('98', 222, 3, 4, 460191) My fast is against no one party, group or individual exclusively and yet it excludes nobody.
('98', 222, 3, 5, 460284) It is addressed to the conscience of all, even the majority community in the other Dominion.
('98', 222, 3, 6, 460377) If all or any one of the groups responds fully, I know the miracle will be achieved.
('98', 222, 3, 7, 460462) For instance, if the Sikhs respond to my appeal as one man, I shall be wholly satisfied.
('98', 222, 3, 8, 460551) I shall go and live in their midst in the Punjab, for they are a brave people and I know they can set an example in non violence of the brave which will serve as an object lesson to all the rest.

('98', 222, 7, 12, 460825) BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
('98', 222, 8, 13, 460847) Today I may not finish my speech in 15 minutes as usual, as I have much to say.
('98', 222, 8, 14, 460927) Today I have come to the prayer meeting because for the first twenty four hours after beginning a fast the body does not feel it or should not feel it.
('98', 222, 8, 15, 461079) I began eating at half past nine this morning.

('98', 222, 8, 18, 461208) 4 So I have been able to come to the meeting and this is not surprising.
('98', 222, 8, 19, 461281) Today I can walk about and sit up and I have also done some work.
('98', 222, 8, 20, 461347) From tomorrow there will be some change.
('98', 222, 8, 21, 461388) Rather than coming here and not speaking, I might as well sit in my room and think.
('98', 222, 8, 22, 461472) If I have to utter the name of God, I can do it there.
('98', 222, 8, 23, 461527) I therefore
('98', 222, 9, 24, 461539) 1 Reproduced from Pyarelal’s article “An All in Fast” 2 The gathering at the prayer meeting was much larger than usual.
('98', 222, 9, 25, 461659) 3 Vallabhbhai Patel was with Gandhiji for nearly 45 minutes.
('98', 222, 9, 26, 461720) Prominent among the callers were Abul Kalam Azad, Jairamdas Doulatram, H. S. Suhrawardy and Dr. Jivraj Mehta.
('98', 222, 9, 27, 461830) 4 Prayers were held at 11 a.
('98', 222, 9, 28, 461859) as Gandhiji commenced his fast.
('98', 223, 0, 1, 461891) 224 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 223, 1, 2, 461933) feel that I shall not be coming to the prayer meeting from tomorrow.
('98', 223, 1, 3, 462002) But if you do wish to join in the prayer you may come if you feel like it.
('98', 223, 1, 4, 462077) The girls will come and sing the prayer.
('98', 223, 1, 5, 462118) At least one of them will come.
('98', 223, 1, 6, 462150) I have told you my programme in case you should feel disappointed at my not coming.
('98', 223, 1, 7, 462234) I had written down yesterday’s speech and it has been published in the newspapers.
('98', 223, 1, 8, 462317) Now that I have started my fast many people cannot understand what I am doing, who are the offenders—Hindus or Sikhs or Muslims.
('98', 223, 1, 9, 462446) How long will the fast last?
('98', 223, 1, 10, 462475) I say I do not blame anyone.
('98', 223, 1, 11, 462504) Who am I to accuse others?
('98', 223, 1, 12, 462531) I have said that we have all sinned.
('98', 223, 1, 13, 462568) That does not mean that any one particular man has sinned.
('98', 223, 1, 14, 462627) Hindus in trying to drive out the Muslims are not following Hinduism.
('98', 223, 1, 15, 462697) And today it is both Hindus and Sikhs who are trying to do so.
('98', 223, 1, 16, 462760) But I do not accuse all the Hindus and Sikhs because not all of them are doing it.
('98', 223, 1, 17, 462843) People should understand this.
('98', 223, 1, 18, 462874) If they do not, my purpose will not be realized and the fast too will not be terminated.
('98', 223, 1, 19, 462963) If I do not survive the fast, no one is to be blamed.
('98', 223, 1, 20, 463017) If I am proved unworthy, God will take me away.
('98', 223, 1, 21, 463065) People ask me if my fast is intended for the cause of the Muslims.
('98', 223, 1, 22, 463132) I admit that that is so.
('98', 223, 1, 23, 463157) Because Muslims here today have lost everything in the world.
('98', 223, 1, 24, 463219) Formerly they could depend on the Government.
('98', 223, 1, 25, 463265) There was also the Muslim League.
('98', 223, 1, 26, 463299) Today the Muslim League is no longer there.
('98', 223, 1, 27, 463343) The League got the country partitioned and even after the partition there are large numbers of Muslims here.
('98', 223, 1, 28, 463452) I have always held that those who have been left behind in India should be given all help.
('98', 223, 1, 29, 463543) It is only humanity.
('98', 223, 1, 30, 463564) Mine is a fast of self purification.
('98', 223, 1, 31, 463601) Everyone should purify himself.
('98', 223, 1, 32, 463633) If not, the situation cannot be saved.
('98', 223, 1, 33, 463672) If everyone is to purify himself, Muslims will also purify themselves.
('98', 223, 1, 34, 463743) Everyone should cleanse his heart.
('98', 223, 1, 35, 463778) No one should find fault with the Muslims whatever they may do.
('98', 223, 1, 36, 463842) If I confess before someone that I have done wrong, then it is a kind of atonement.
('98', 223, 1, 37, 463926) I do not say this in order to appease the Muslims or anyone else.
('98', 223, 1, 38, 463992) I want to appease myself which means that I want to appease God.
('98', 223, 1, 39, 464057) I do not want to be a sinner against God.
('98', 223, 1, 40, 464099) Muslims also must become pure and live peacefully in India.
('98', 223, 1, 41, 464159) What happened was that for election purposes Hindus and Sikhs recognized the Muslim League.
('98', 223, 1, 42, 464251) I shall not go into that history.
('98', 223, 1, 43, 464285) Then followed the partition.
('98', 223, 1, 44, 464314) But before partition became a fact the hearts had already become divided.
('98', 223, 1, 45, 464388) Muslims were also at fault here, though we cannot say that they alone were at fault.
('98', 224, 0, 1, 464473) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 225
('98', 224, 1, 2, 464520) Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims, all are to blame.
('98', 224, 1, 3, 464565) Now all of them have to become friends again.
('98', 224, 1, 4, 464611) Let them look to God, not to Satan.
('98', 224, 1, 5, 464647) Among the Muslims too there are many who worship Satan.
('98', 224, 1, 6, 464703) Among the Hindus and the Sikhs many worship not Nanak and other Gurus, but Satan.
('98', 224, 1, 7, 464785) In the name of religion we have become irreligious.
('98', 224, 1, 8, 464837) Since I have undertaken the fast in the cause of the Muslims, a great responsibility has come to devolve on them.
('98', 224, 1, 9, 464951) They must understand that if they are to live with the Hindus as brothers they must be loyal to the Indian Union, not to Pakistan.
('98', 224, 1, 10, 465082) I shall not ask them whether they are loyal or not.
('98', 224, 1, 11, 465134) I shall judge them by their conduct.
('98', 224, 1, 12, 465171) Then the name of the Sardar is being mentioned.
('98', 224, 1, 13, 465219) The Muslims say that I am good, but the Sardar is not and he must be removed.
('98', 224, 1, 14, 465297) They say that Jawaharlal too is good.
('98', 224, 1, 15, 465335) They say if I join the Government it will be a good thing.
('98', 224, 1, 16, 465394) They object only to the Sardar.
('98', 224, 1, 17, 465426) I must tell the Muslims that their argument serves no purpose, because the Government is the whole Cabinet, neither the Sardar nor Jawahar by himself.
('98', 224, 1, 18, 465577) They are your servants.
('98', 224, 1, 19, 465601) You can remove them.
('98', 224, 1, 20, 465622) Yes, Muslims alone cannot remove them.
('98', 224, 1, 21, 465661) But at least they can bring to the Sardar’s notice any mistakes which in their opinion he commits.
('98', 224, 1, 22, 465760) It will not do merely to criticize him by quoting some statement or other he might have made.
('98', 224, 1, 23, 465854) You must say what he has done.
('98', 224, 1, 24, 465885) You must tell me.
('98', 224, 1, 25, 465903) I meet him often and I shall bring it to his notice.
('98', 224, 1, 26, 465956) Jawaharlal can dismiss him and if he does not, there must be some reason.
('98', 224, 1, 27, 466030) He praises the Sardar.
('98', 224, 1, 28, 466053) 1 Then the Government is responsible for whatever the Sardar does.
('98', 224, 1, 29, 466120) You too are responsible for he is your representative.
('98', 224, 1, 30, 466175) That is how things go in a democracy.
('98', 224, 1, 31, 466213) Therefore I shall say that the Muslims must become brave and fearless.
('98', 224, 1, 32, 466284) They should also become God fearing.
('98', 224, 1, 33, 466321) They must think that for them there is no League, no Congress, no Gandhi, no Jawaharlal but only God, that they are here in the name of God.
('98', 224, 1, 34, 466462) Let them not take offence at whatever Hindus and Sikhs may do.
('98', 224, 1, 35, 466525) I am with them.
('98', 224, 1, 36, 466541) I want to live and die with them.
('98', 224, 1, 37, 466575) If I cannot keep you united, my life is worthless.
('98', 224, 1, 38, 466626) The Muslims thus carry a great responsibility.
('98', 224, 1, 39, 466673) They must not forget this.
('98', 224, 1, 40, 466700) The Sardar is blunt of speech.
('98', 224, 1, 41, 466731) What he says sometimes sounds bitter.
('98', 224, 1, 42, 466769) The fault is in his tongue.
('98', 224, 1, 43, 466797) I can testify that his heart is not like
('98', 224, 2, 44, 466838) 1 The report in The Hindustan Times here adds: “The Sardar had not ceased to be his (Gandhiji’s) esteemed friend though he was no longer his ‘yes man’ as he was once popularly and affectionately nick named.”
('98', 225, 0, 1, 467046) 226 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 225, 1, 2, 467088) his tongue.
('98', 225, 1, 3, 467100) He has said in Lucknow 1 and in Calcutta 2 that all Muslims should live here and can live here.
('98', 225, 1, 4, 467196) He also told me that he could not trust those Muslims who till the other day followed the League and considered themselves enemies of Hindus and Sikhs and who could not have changed overnight and suddenly become friends.
('98', 225, 1, 5, 467417) If the League is still there who will they obey, Pakistan or our Government?
('98', 225, 1, 6, 467494) The League’s persistence in its old attitude makes him suspect it, and rightly so.
('98', 225, 1, 7, 467577) He says that he no longer has faith in the bona fides of the League Muslims and he cannot trust them.
('98', 225, 1, 8, 467679) Let them prove that they can be trusted.
('98', 225, 1, 9, 467720) Then I have the right to tell the Hindus and Sikhs what they should do.
('98', 225, 1, 10, 467792) The song 3 these girls sang was composed by Gurudev.
('98', 225, 1, 11, 467845) We sang it during our tours in Noakhali.
('98', 225, 1, 12, 467886) A man walking alone calls to others to come and join him.
('98', 225, 1, 13, 467944) But if no one comes and it is dark, the Poet says, the man should walk alone because God is already with him.
('98', 225, 1, 14, 468054) I asked the girls especially to sing this song which is in Bengali.
('98', 225, 1, 15, 468122) Otherwise they would have sung only Hindustani songs.
('98', 225, 1, 16, 468176) The Hindus and Sikhs should cultivate this attitude if they are true to their religions.
('98', 225, 1, 17, 468265) They should not generate an atmosphere in which the Muslims should be compelled to flee to Pakistan.
('98', 225, 1, 18, 468366) Hindus and Sikhs should become brave and show that even if all the Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan were to be killed there would be no retaliation in India.
('98', 225, 1, 19, 468520) I do not want to live to see our people copy Pakistan.
('98', 225, 1, 20, 468575) If I am to live I shall ask every Hindu and every Sikh not to touch a single Muslim.
('98', 225, 1, 21, 468660) It is cowardice to kill Muslims and we must become brave and not cowards.
('98', 225, 2, 22, 468734) 1 Addressing a public meeting at Lucknow on January 6, Vallabhbhai Patel had said: “I want to ask the Indian Muslims only one question.
('98', 225, 2, 23, 468870) In the recent All India Muslim Conference why did you not open your mouths on the Kashmir issue?
('98', 225, 2, 24, 468967) Why did you not condemn the action of Pakistan?
('98', 225, 2, 25, 469015) These things create doubt in the minds of people.
('98', 225, 2, 26, 469065) So I want to say a word as a friend of Muslims.
('98', 225, 2, 27, 469113) It is our duty now to sail in the same boat and sink or swim.
('98', 225, 2, 28, 469175) I want to tell you very clearly that you cannot ride two horses.
('98', 225, 2, 29, 469240) You select one horse, whichever you like better.” 2 Speaking at a mammoth gathering at Calcutta on January 3, Vallabhbhai Patel had emphasized that there could be no serious talk of a Hindu State.
('98', 225, 2, 30, 469437) But one fact was indisputable.
('98', 225, 2, 31, 469468) There were 4_ crores of Muslims in India many of whom had helped the creation of Pakistan.
('98', 225, 2, 32, 469559) How could one believe that they would change overnight.
('98', 225, 2, 33, 469615) “The Muslims said they were loyal citizens, and therefore, why should anybody doubt their bona fides?
('98', 225, 2, 34, 469717) To them we would say: ‘Why do you ask us?
('98', 225, 2, 35, 469759) Search your own conscience’.” 3 With the refrain Ekla chalo re—Walk thou alone
('98', 226, 0, 1, 469838) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 227
('98', 226, 1, 2, 469885) I shall terminate the fast only when peace has returned to Delhi.
('98', 226, 1, 3, 469951) If peace is restored to Delhi it will have effect not only on the whole of India but also on Pakistan and when that happens, a Muslim can walk around in the city all by himself.
('98', 226, 1, 4, 470129) I shall then terminate the fast.
('98', 226, 1, 5, 470162) Delhi is the capital of India.
('98', 226, 1, 6, 470193) It has always been the capital of India.
('98', 226, 1, 7, 470234) So long as things do not return to normal in Delhi, they will not be normal either in India or in Pakistan.
('98', 226, 1, 8, 470342) Today I cannot bring Suhrawardy here because I fear someone may insult him.
('98', 226, 1, 9, 470418) Today he cannot walk about in the streets of Delhi.
('98', 226, 1, 10, 470470) If he did he would be assaulted.
('98', 226, 1, 11, 470503) What I want is that he should be able to move about here even in the dark.
('98', 226, 1, 12, 470578) It is true that he made efforts in Calcutta only when Muslims became involved.
('98', 226, 1, 13, 470657) Still, he could have made the situation worse, if he had wanted, but he did not want to make things worse.
('98', 226, 1, 14, 470764) He made the Muslims evacuate the places they had forcibly occupied and said that he being the Premier could do so.
('98', 226, 1, 15, 470879) Although the places occupied by the Muslims belonged to Hindus and Sikhs he did his duty.
('98', 226, 1, 16, 470969) Even if it takes a whole month to have real peace established in Delhi it does not matter.
('98', 226, 1, 17, 471060) People should not do anything merely to have me terminate the fast.
('98', 226, 1, 18, 471128) So my wish is that Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis, Christians and Muslims who are in India should continue to live in India and India should become a country where everyone’s life and property are safe.
('98', 226, 1, 19, 471322) Only then will India progress.

('98', 226, 7, 28, 471564) You have considerable capability in you but that has not been developed fully because of your withdrawing nature.
('98', 226, 7, 29, 471678) Think over this.
('98', 226, 7, 30, 471695) Your timidity is killing you.

('98', 227, 1, 2, 471934) like you to do so.
('98', 227, 1, 3, 471953) You should admit that, since you are lacking in firmness of mind, if you eat at somebody’s place you will eat only what and as much as he permits.
('98', 227, 1, 4, 472100) You should say you will get used to it by and by.
('98', 227, 1, 5, 472150) You should explain this fearlessly to everybody.
('98', 227, 1, 6, 472199) Only then will your latent capacity come out and shine.
('98', 227, 1, 7, 472255) You don’t know how much it pains me to see you keep ill.

('98', 228, 4, 6, 473820) It is the second day of the fast though it is not yet twenty four hours since the fast commenced.
('98', 228, 4, 7, 473918) It is the last day for posting matter for this week’s Harijan.
('98', 228, 4, 8, 473981) So I think it proper to address a few words to the people of Gujarat.
('98', 228, 4, 9, 474051) I do not consider this an ordinary fast.
('98', 228, 4, 10, 474092) I have undertaken it after much reflection.
('98', 228, 4, 11, 474136) Yet it is not reflection that has impelled it; it is God who rules over reason.
('98', 228, 4, 12, 474216) It is addressed to no one or is addressed to all.
('98', 228, 4, 13, 474266) There is no anger of any kind behind it, nor the slightest tinge of impatience.
('98', 228, 4, 14, 474346) There is a time for everything.
('98', 228, 4, 15, 474378) Of what use would any efforts be after the opportunity has slipped?
('98', 228, 4, 16, 474446) What therefore remains to be considered is whether there is something that each Indian can do.
('98', 228, 4, 17, 474541) Gujaratis are Indians.
('98', 228, 4, 18, 474564) And since I write this in Gujarati it is addressed to all Indians who know Gujarati.
('98', 228, 4, 19, 474649) Delhi is the capital of India.
('98', 228, 4, 20, 474680) If we do not accept partition in our hearts, that is, if we do not consider Hindus and Muslims separate peoples, we shall have to admit that Delhi is no longer the capital of India as we have visualized it.
('98', 228, 4, 21, 474887) Delhi has always been the capital.
('98', 228, 4, 22, 474922) It is this city which was Indraprastha, which was Hastinapur.
('98', 228, 4, 23, 474984) We see the ruins standing today.
('98', 228, 4, 24, 475017) It is the heart of India.
('98', 228, 4, 25, 475043) It would be the limit of foolishness to regard it as belonging only to the Hindus or the Sikhs.
('98', 228, 4, 26, 475139) It may sound harsh but there is no exaggeration in it.
('98', 228, 4, 27, 475194) It is the literal truth.
('98', 228, 4, 28, 475219) All Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Parsis, Christians and Jews who people this country from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Karachi to Dibrugarh in Assam and who have lovingly and in a spirit of service adopted it as their dear motherland, have an equal right to it.
('98', 228, 4, 29, 475479) No one can say that it has place only for the majority and the minority should be dishonoured.
('98', 228, 4, 30, 475574) Whoever serves it with the purest devotion must have the first right over it.
('98', 228, 4, 31, 475652) Therefore, anyone who seeks to drive out the Muslims is Delhi’s enemy number one and therefore India’s enemy number one.
('98', 228, 4, 32, 475773) We are heading towards that catastrophe.
('98', 228, 5, 33, 475814) 1 A translation of this appeared in Harijan, 18 1 1948.
('98', 229, 0, 1, 475870) 230 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 229, 1, 2, 475912) Every Indian must do his bit to ward it off.
('98', 229, 1, 3, 475957) What should we do then?
('98', 229, 1, 4, 475981) If we would see Panchayat Raj, i.
('98', 229, 1, 5, 476015) e., democracy established, we would regard the humblest and the lowliest Indian as being equally the ruler of India with the tallest in the land.
('98', 229, 1, 6, 476161) For this everyone should be pure.
('98', 229, 1, 7, 476195) If they are not they should become so.
('98', 229, 1, 8, 476234) He who is pure will also be wise.
('98', 229, 1, 9, 476268) He will observe no distinctions between caste and caste, between touchable and untouchable, but will consider everyone equal with himself.
('98', 229, 1, 10, 476407) He will bind others to himself with love.
('98', 229, 1, 11, 476449) To him no one would be an untouchable.
('98', 229, 1, 12, 476488) He would treat the labourers the same as he would the capitalists.
('98', 229, 1, 13, 476555) He will, like the millions of toilers, earn his living from service of others and will make no distinction between intellectual and manual work.
('98', 229, 1, 14, 476700) To hasten this desirable consummation, we should voluntarily turn ourselves into scavengers.
('98', 229, 1, 15, 476793) He who is wise will never touch opium, liquor or any intoxicants.
('98', 229, 1, 16, 476859) He will observe the vow of swadeshi and regard every woman who is not his wife as his mother, sister or daughter according to her age, and never see anyone with eyes of lust.
('98', 229, 1, 17, 477034) He will concede to woman the same rights he claims for himself.
('98', 229, 1, 18, 477098) If need be he will, sacrifice his own life but never kill another.
('98', 229, 1, 19, 477165) If he is a Sikh, he will, as taught by the Gurus, be as heroic “as one lakh and a quarter” of men and will not yield an inch.
('98', 229, 1, 20, 477291) Such an Indian will not ask what his duty in the present hour is.

('98', 229, 2, 22, 477426) 244. LETTER TO DEVDAS GANDHI
('98', 229, 3, 23, 477455) Makar Sankranti, January 14,1948
('98', 229, 4, 24, 477488) DEVDAS, I have been through your letter early in the morning after the prayer.
('98', 229, 4, 25, 477567) 1 I also understand the little talk we had yesterday.
('98', 229, 5, 26, 477621) 1 The addressee’s letter dated January 13, 1948 read: “Your statement has been written in haste.
('98', 229, 5, 27, 477718) Quite a few improvements could have been made in it.
('98', 229, 5, 28, 477771) I had wished to tell you my views about the propriety of your fasting.
('98', 229, 5, 29, 477842) But as I had no hint of the oncoming fast, I made no attempts to tell you these.
('98', 229, 5, 30, 477923) My chief concern and my argument against your fast is that you have surrendered to impatience, whereas your mission by its very nature calls for infinite patience.
('98', 229, 5, 31, 478087) You do not seem to have realized what a tremendous success your patient labour has achieved.
('98', 229, 5, 32, 478180) It has saved ...
('98', 229, 5, 33, 478197) thousands of lives and may still save many more.
('98', 229, 5, 34, 478246) .By your death you will not be able to accomplish what you can by living.
('98', 229, 5, 35, 478320) I would, therefore, beseech you to pay heed to my entreats and give up your decision to fast.”
('98', 230, 0, 1, 478415) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 231
('98', 230, 1, 2, 478462) statement was not issued in haste in your sense of the word.
('98', 230, 1, 3, 478523) In one sense it was, because I took less time in drafting it than I normally would.
('98', 230, 1, 4, 478607) The reason for it was the four days of reflection and prayer that preceded it.
('98', 230, 1, 5, 478686) That statement was the result of reflection and prayer, and so it cannot be called a hasty one either in my language or in the language of anyone who knows.
('98', 230, 1, 6, 478843) The statement certainly needed some polishing for improving the expression and making the language more refined and I made the changes the moment you suggested them.
('98', 230, 1, 7, 479009) I did not want to hear either from you or from anyone about the propriety of my fast.
('98', 230, 1, 8, 479095) That I have listened to you so far is a sign of my modesty and patience.
('98', 230, 1, 9, 479168) You got the notice the moment I thought about it.
('98', 230, 1, 10, 479218) Your main anxiety and your reasoning are meaningless.
('98', 230, 1, 11, 479272) It is true you are my friend.
('98', 230, 1, 12, 479302) It is true that you have risen high.
('98', 230, 1, 13, 479339) But you can never cease to be a son and so your concern is only natural.
('98', 230, 1, 14, 479412) However, your reasoning displays shallowness of thought and impatience.
('98', 230, 1, 15, 479484) I consider this act of mine as the extreme limit to my patience.
('98', 230, 1, 16, 479549) Is patience that kills its very object patience or stupidity?
('98', 230, 1, 17, 479611) I can’t claim credit for what has been achieved since my arrival in Delhi.
('98', 230, 1, 18, 479686) It would be sheer conceit on my part to do so.
('98', 230, 1, 19, 479733) That one or more lives were saved through my efforts has no value for the world.
('98', 230, 1, 20, 479814) Only the All knowing God can see its value.
('98', 230, 1, 21, 479858) It is nothing but ignorance to say that “one who had been patient from the beginning of September has ceased to be so all of a sudden.” It was only when in terms of human effort I had exhausted all resources and realized my utter helplessness that I laid my head on God’s lap.
('98', 230, 1, 22, 480135) That is the meaning of the fast.
('98', 230, 1, 23, 480168) Read and think over Gajendramoksha which is considered the greatest epic.
('98', 230, 1, 24, 480242) Perhaps then you will be able to value my action.
('98', 230, 1, 25, 480292) The last sentence of your letter is a beautiful expression of your love.
('98', 230, 1, 26, 480365) The origin of that love is ignorance or attachment.
('98', 230, 1, 27, 480417) That this attachment is universal does not make it enlightenment.
('98', 230, 1, 28, 480483) So long as we are unable to leave aside the question of life and death it is an illusion to think that we can do a particular thing only if we are alive.
('98', 230, 1, 29, 480637) Strive as long as you are alive is a beautiful thing to say but bear in mind that striving has to be in a spirit of detachment.
('98', 230, 1, 30, 480765) Now perhaps you will understand why I cannot comply with your request.
('98', 230, 1, 31, 480836) Rama who, has prompted me to go on fast will bid me give it up if He wants me to do so.
('98', 230, 1, 32, 480924) In the mean time you, I and all of us should realize and have faith that it is equally well whether Rama preserves my life or ends it.
('98', 230, 1, 33, 481059) I have only one prayer: ‘O Rama, give me strength during the fast so that desire to live may not tempt me into premature termination
('98', 231, 0, 1, 481192) 232 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 231, 1, 2, 481234) of my fast.’ Preserve this letter which I have dictated to Manu after deep thought and read it from time to time.

('98', 231, 7, 8, 481463) When the Delhi Maulanas came to see him in the course of the day Gandhiji greeted them with, “Are you now satisfied?” Then, turning to the one who had said to him three days ago that he should get the Union Government to send them to England, he remarked: I had no answer to give you then.
('98', 231, 7, 9, 481753) I can now face you.
('98', 231, 7, 10, 481773) Shall I ask the Government to arrange a passage for you to England?
('98', 231, 7, 11, 481841) I shall say to them: Here are the unfaithful Muslims who want to desert India.
('98', 231, 7, 12, 481920) Give them the facility they want.
('98', 231, 8, 13, 481954) The Maulana said he felt sorry if his words had hurt him.
('98', 231, 8, 14, 482012) Gandhiji retorted with urbane banter: That would be like the Englishman who kicks you and at the same time goes on saying, ‘I beg your pardon’!
('98', 231, 8, 15, 482156) Do you not feel ashamed of asking to be sent to England?
('98', 231, 8, 16, 482213) And then you said that slavery under the British rule was better than independence under the Union of India.
('98', 231, 8, 17, 482322) How dare you, who claim to be patriots and nationalists, utter such words?
('98', 231, 8, 18, 482397) You have to cleanse your hearts and learn to be cent per cent truthful.
('98', 231, 8, 19, 482469) Otherwise India will not tolerate you for long and even I shall not be able to help you.

('98', 232, 2, 3, 482703) NEW DELHI, January 14, 1948
('98', 232, 3, 4, 482731) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, Yesterday I said I might not be able to come to the meeting today.
('98', 232, 3, 5, 482820) But I have managed it.
('98', 232, 3, 6, 482843) However, from tomorrow or the day after I may not be in a condition to move about.
('98', 232, 3, 7, 482926) Doctors have advised me rest from today.
('98', 232, 3, 8, 482967) 1 I have placed myself not in the hands of the doctors but in the hands of God.
('98', 232, 3, 9, 483047) I have no such attachment for life that I must live under any circumstances.
('98', 232, 3, 10, 483124) Whether I die or live is wholly in the hands of God.
('98', 232, 3, 11, 483177) I can only pray that my faith may remain firm and no one may interfere in my acting on that faith.
('98', 232, 3, 12, 483276) Today man has become weak.
('98', 232, 3, 13, 483303) He asks: Where is God?
('98', 232, 3, 14, 483326) I want everyone to become strong.
('98', 232, 3, 15, 483360) Only then can we escape misery.
('98', 232, 3, 16, 483392) The few things I wanted to say to you I had in fact dictated in English, because I was not sure what my physical condition would be.
('98', 232, 3, 17, 483525) I thought if I could not speak to you, a translation of the message could be read out.
('98', 232, 3, 18, 483612) It was intended not only for you but for the millions in the country who would hear it on the radio and those who want to hear in my own voice what I have to say.
('98', 232, 3, 19, 483775) I am a prisoner of their love and I thought that they had better hear my own voice today.
('98', 232, 3, 20, 483865) I feel that a thirty six hours’ fast is very useful physically.
('98', 232, 3, 21, 483929) It cleanses the body and can cause no harm.
('98', 232, 3, 22, 483973) True, I have to conserve my energy for the future but God will see to that.
('98', 232, 3, 23, 484049) I have been receiving many telegrams from all quarters—a lot of them from Muslims.
('98', 232, 3, 24, 484132) I have also had cablegrams from outside India.
('98', 232, 3, 25, 484179) I have told Pyarelal to pick out the most relevant of them.
('98', 232, 3, 26, 484239) Not all need be published; only the few that can teach something to the people should be published.
('98', 232, 3, 27, 484339) There are others which say that I should give up the fast and all will be well.
('98', 232, 3, 28, 484419) But how can I give up the fast?
('98', 232, 3, 29, 484451) God inspired the fast and He alone may terminate it.
('98', 232, 3, 30, 484504) I have a telephonic message from Mridulabehn.
('98', 232, 3, 31, 484550) She is in Lahore.
('98', 232, 3, 32, 484568) She has a large number of friends among Muslims.
('98', 232, 3, 33, 484617) She is a Hindu girl.
('98', 232, 3, 34, 484638) The fast has distressed her.
('98', 232, 3, 35, 484667) I carried her in my arms when she was a little girl.
('98', 232, 3, 36, 484720) Now she has grown
('98', 232, 4, 37, 484738) 1 Gandhiji spent the second day of his fast as per his normal routine except for the morning and evening walks.
('98', 232, 4, 38, 484850) He took hot water without salt or lime, participated in two meetings with the Cabinet Ministers and received a deputation of refugees from the N. W. F. P., besides a number of visitors and friends.
('98', 232, 4, 39, 485048) Jivraj Mehta and Sushila Nayyar issued a health bulletin that each day’s fast increased both immediate and future danger to Gandhiji’s life.
('98', 233, 0, 1, 485189) 234 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 233, 1, 2, 485231) She goes about everywhere all by herself.
('98', 233, 1, 3, 485273) She says Muslims, even officers in the Pakistan Government are asking her what they can do for me, now that I am doing what I am doing for their sake.
('98', 233, 1, 4, 485424) This pleased me.
('98', 233, 1, 5, 485441) I do not know whether my message has reached them.
('98', 233, 1, 6, 485492) By tomorrow it will certainly reach them.
('98', 233, 1, 7, 485534) My answer is that there is no need for them to ask.
('98', 233, 1, 8, 485586) Although this yajna is being performed in Delhi it is for the whole country.
('98', 233, 1, 9, 485663) The fast is for self purification.
('98', 233, 1, 10, 485698) You must have God enthroned where today Satan sits enthroned.
('98', 233, 1, 11, 485760) There must be some indication of it.
('98', 233, 1, 12, 485797) Everybody cannot undertake a fast.
('98', 233, 1, 13, 485832) It has become my proud privilege to do so.
('98', 233, 1, 14, 485875) If everyone had this privilege they would have lived in amity.
('98', 233, 1, 15, 485938) Hindus say, ‘Kill the Muslims.’ Muslims say, ‘Kill the Hindus.’ Sikhs say, ‘Kill the Muslims.’ If Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs fight in this way it helps no one.
('98', 233, 1, 16, 486097) If you want to participate in the yajna, you must become brothers and should have love instead of hate in your hearts.
('98', 233, 1, 17, 486216) Let all Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs pledge that they will not touch liquor, they will not touch opium.
('98', 233, 1, 18, 486317) They will have nothing to do with adulterous men and adulterous women.
('98', 233, 1, 19, 486388) Everyone will look upon other women as mothers or sisters or daughters.
('98', 233, 1, 20, 486460) Everyone must exercise self restraint and become clean.
('98', 233, 1, 21, 486516) If they do all these things and if even then I regard Pakistan as full of sin, I will have to repent and say that Pakistan is not a land of sin but a land of purity.
('98', 233, 1, 22, 486682) But what is needed is action, not mere words.
('98', 233, 1, 23, 486728) If the Muslims of Pakistan become thus transformed, it is bound to have an effect in India.
('98', 233, 1, 24, 486820) I have never tried to hide my view that Pakistan has committed crimes against Hindus.
('98', 233, 1, 25, 486906) What has happened in Karachi?
('98', 233, 1, 26, 486936) Innocent Sikhs were murdered and their properties looted.
('98', 233, 1, 27, 486994) Now I understand the same thing has happened in Gujrat.
('98', 233, 1, 28, 487050) 1 There was a caravan coming from Bannu or somewhere.
('98', 233, 1, 29, 487104) They were all refugees running away to save their lives.
('98', 233, 1, 30, 487161) They were waylaid and cut down.
('98', 233, 1, 31, 487193) I do not want to relate this grim tale.
('98', 233, 1, 32, 487233) I ask the Muslims if in their name this kind of thing continues in Pakistan, how long will the people in India tolerate it.
('98', 233, 1, 33, 487357) Even if a hundred men like me fasted they would not be able to stop the
('98', 233, 2, 34, 487429) 1 On January 13, a train carrying non Muslim refugees from Bannu was attacked at the Gujrat (West Punjab) Station by the tribesmen who had assembled there on their way to Jammu.
('98', 233, 2, 35, 487607) In spite of the heroic defence put up by the troops escorting the train, hundreds of refugees were killed or maimed and women and girls abducted by the tribesmen.

('98', 234, 1, 2, 487817) tragedy that may follow.
('98', 234, 1, 3, 487842) You should all become good.
('98', 234, 1, 4, 487870) Whether you are Muslims or tribals, you must all say that you will have the Hindus and Sikhs back.
('98', 234, 1, 5, 487969) The poet says, “If there is paradise it is here, it is here.” He had said it about a garden.
('98', 234, 1, 6, 488062) I read it ages ago when I was a child.
('98', 234, 1, 7, 488101) But paradise is not so easily secured.
('98', 234, 1, 8, 488140) If Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs became decent, became brothers, then that verse could be inscribed on every door.
('98', 234, 1, 9, 488251) But that will be only when Pakistan has become pure.
('98', 234, 1, 10, 488304) But if you say one thing and do another, the place will become another hell.
('98', 234, 1, 11, 488381) Cleanse your hearts and install God there.
('98', 234, 1, 12, 488424) If that happens in Pakistan, we in India shall not be behind them.
('98', 234, 1, 13, 488491) It does not matter that the country is geographically divided, so long as our hearts are one.
('98', 234, 1, 14, 488585) There are so many different governments in the world.
('98', 234, 1, 15, 488639) What does it matter if there are fifty or five hundred?
('98', 234, 1, 16, 488695) There are seven hundred thousand villages in India.
('98', 234, 1, 17, 488747) If each one of them had a government of their own it would be a good thing.
('98', 234, 1, 18, 488823) They tell me that I am mad and have a habit of going on fast on the slightest pretext.
('98', 234, 1, 19, 488910) But I am made that way.
('98', 234, 1, 20, 488934) When I was young I never even read the newspapers.
('98', 234, 1, 21, 488985) I could read English with difficulty and my Gujarati was not satisfactory.
('98', 234, 1, 22, 489060) I have had the dream ever since then that if the Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis, Christians and Muslims could live in amity not only in Rajkot but in the whole of India, they would all have a very happy life.
('98', 234, 1, 23, 489260) If that dream could be realized even now when I am an old man on the verge of death, my heart would dance.
('98', 234, 1, 24, 489367) Children would then frolic in joy to see that there is no strife any more.
('98', 234, 1, 25, 489442) I urge all of you to help me in this task.
('98', 234, 1, 26, 489485) If we all persevere in our respective religions and become good there can be harmony between all religions.
('98', 234, 1, 27, 489593) We must not fear whether a man is a Sikh or a Pathan.
('98', 234, 1, 28, 489647) We must fear God.
('98', 234, 1, 29, 489665) This is what I want to see.
('98', 234, 1, 30, 489693) You can all try and become such men.
('98', 234, 1, 31, 489730) What after all is society?
('98', 234, 1, 32, 489757) Society is made up of individuals.
('98', 234, 1, 33, 489792) It is we that make society.
('98', 234, 1, 34, 489820) We are asleep and then say that we are helpless because society is such.
('98', 234, 1, 35, 489893) The same goes for the Government.
('98', 234, 1, 36, 489927) It is we who are the Government.
('98', 234, 1, 37, 489960) If one man takes the initiative others will follow and one can become many; if there is not even one there is nothing.
('98', 234, 1, 38, 490079) I am not sure that I shall be able to come here tomorrow.
('98', 234, 1, 39, 490137) But the prayers will be held and the girls will sing the bhajans.

('98', 235, 1, 2, 490318) 247. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETIING1
('98', 235, 2, 3, 490350) NEW DELHI, January 15, 1948
('98', 235, 3, 4, 490378) BROTHER AND SISTERS, This is a new experience for me.
('98', 235, 3, 5, 490432) I have never so far had occasion to convey my word thus to the people.
('98', 235, 3, 6, 490503) I cannot go to the prayer ground and my voice from here cannot reach you.
('98', 235, 3, 7, 490577) Even so I thought that if you could hear my voice you would feel reassured.
('98', 235, 3, 8, 490653) I have already dictated what I have to say.
('98', 235, 3, 9, 490697) I do not know for how long this state will continue.
('98', 235, 4, 10, 490750) My request to you is that none of you should think what another is doing, but each of you should examine your own self and purify yourself to the extent you can.
('98', 235, 4, 11, 490912) I am convinced that if people in large numbers purify themselves it will do them a lot of good and it will also do me good.
('98', 235, 4, 12, 491036) India then will benefit and maybe I shall be able to give up my fast sooner.
('98', 235, 4, 13, 491113) Let no one be concerned about me.
('98', 235, 4, 14, 491147) Let everyone be concerned for himself.
('98', 235, 4, 15, 491186) You must give thought to the progress of the country and the welfare of the people.
('98', 235, 4, 16, 491270) In the end all men have to die.
('98', 235, 4, 17, 491302) He who is born cannot escape death.
('98', 235, 4, 18, 491338) Why then should we fear death or grieve over it?
('98', 235, 4, 19, 491387) It is my belief that death is a friend to whom we should be grateful, for it frees us from the manifold ills which are our lot.
('98', 235, 4, 20, 491515) Newspapermen sent me a message two hours after my prayer speech of last evening, asking to see me as they had some doubts to be cleared.
('98', 235, 4, 21, 491652) After a heavy day’s work I felt disinclined out of exhaustion to see them for discussion.
('98', 235, 4, 22, 491742) I, therefore, told Pyarelal to inform them to excuse me and further tell them that they should put down the questions in writing and send them to me next morning.
('98', 235, 4, 23, 491905) They have done so.
('98', 235, 5, 24, 491924) 1 The opening two paragraphs were spoken by Gandhiji, as he lay in bed, on the microphone in Hindi.
('98', 235, 5, 25, 492024) The rest of the speech had been dictated earlier in English to Pyarelal.
('98', 235, 5, 26, 492097) Sushila Nayyar read out the speech in Hindi at the prayer meeting.
('98', 235, 5, 27, 492164) The report in The Hindustan Times has been collated with the Hindi version in Prarthana Pravachan.
('98', 235, 5, 28, 492263) 2 The doctors who examined Gandhiji issued the following bulletin at 4.30 pm.
('98', 235, 5, 29, 492341) “Today is the third day of Gandhiji’s fast.
('98', 235, 5, 30, 492385) He is naturally losing weight.
('98', 235, 5, 31, 492416) The weakness has considerably increased.
('98', 235, 5, 32, 492457) He had to be carried out of the bathroom in an arm chair this morning.
('98', 235, 5, 33, 492528) His voice is feeble.
('98', 235, 5, 34, 492549) Acetone bodies have appeared in the urine...”
('98', 236, 0, 1, 492595) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 237
('98', 236, 1, 2, 492642) Q. You have undertaken the fast when there was no disturbance of any kind in any part of the Indian Dominion.
('98', 236, 1, 3, 492752) What was it if it was not a disturbing disturbance for a crowd to make an organized and a determined attempt to take forcible possession of Muslim houses?
('98', 236, 1, 4, 492907) 1 The disturbance was such that the military had to reluctantly resort to tear gas and even to a little shooting if only in the air, before the crowd dispersed.
('98', 236, 1, 5, 493068) It would have been foolish for me to wait till the last Muslim had been turned out of Delhi by subtle undemonstrative methods, which I would describe as killing by inches.
('98', 236, 2, 6, 493240) Q. You have stated that you could not give any reply to the Muslims who came to you with their tale of fear and insecurity and who have complained that Sardar Patel, who is in charge of the Home Affairs, is anti Muslim.
('98', 236, 2, 7, 493460) You have also stated that Sardar Patel is no longer a “yes man” as he used to be.
('98', 236, 3, 8, 493542) These factors create the impression that the fast is more intended to bring about a change of heart in the Sardar and thereby amounts to a condemnation of the policy of the Home Ministry.
('98', 236, 3, 9, 493730) It would be helpful if you can clear the position.
('98', 236, 3, 10, 493781) As to this I feel that my reply was precise, not admitting of more interpretations than one.
('98', 236, 3, 11, 493874) The suggested interpretation never crossed my mind.
('98', 236, 3, 12, 493926) If I had known that my statement could bear any such interpretation, I would have dispelled the doubt in anticipation.
('98', 236, 3, 13, 494045) Many Muslim friends had complained of the Sardar’s so called anti Muslim attitude.
('98', 236, 3, 14, 494128) I had, with a degree of suppressed pain, listened to them without giving any explanation.
('98', 236, 3, 15, 494218) The fast freed me from the self imposed restraint and I was able to assure the critics that they were wrong in isolating him from Pandit Nehru and me, whom they gratuitously raise to the sky.
('98', 236, 3, 16, 494410) This isolation did them no good.
('98', 236, 3, 17, 494443) The Sardar has a bluntness of speech which sometimes unintentionally hurts, though his heart is expansive enough to accommodate all.
('98', 236, 3, 18, 494576) Thus my statement was meant deliberately to free a lifelong and faithful comrade from any unworthy reproach.
('98', 236, 4, 19, 494685) 1 Vide “Speech at Prayer Meeting”, 4 1 1948. 2 Vide “Speech at Prayer Meeting”, 13 1 1948. 3 Expressing his anguish, Vallabhbhai Patel had written to Gandhiji on January 13, “ .
('98', 236, 4, 20, 494863) you have again and again to take up cudgels on my behalf.
('98', 236, 4, 21, 494921) This ...
('98', 236, 4, 22, 494930) is intolerable to me.” Again on January 16 he said in Bombay that some Muslims went to Gandhiji and complained about his Lucknow speech and “Gandhiji felt compelled to defend me.
('98', 236, 4, 23, 495109) That also pained me, for after all I am not a weak person who should be defended by others.”
('98', 237, 0, 1, 495202) 238 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 237, 1, 2, 495244) Lest my hearers should run away with the idea that my compliment carried the meaning that I could treat the Sardar as my “yes man”, as he was affectionately described, I balanced the compliment by adding the proviso that he was too masterful to be anybody’s “yes man”.
('98', 237, 1, 3, 495513) When he was my “yes man”, he permitted himself to be so named, because whatever I said instinctively appealed to him.
('98', 237, 1, 4, 495631) Great as he was in his own field and a very able administrator, he was humble enough to begin his political education under me because, as he explained to me, he could not take to the politics in vogue at the time I began my public career in India.
('98', 237, 1, 5, 495880) When power descended on him, he saw that he could no longer successfully apply the method of non violence which he used to wield with signal success.
('98', 237, 1, 6, 496030) I have made the discovery that what I and the people with me had termed non violence was not the genuine article but a weak copy known as passive resistance.
('98', 237, 1, 7, 496188) Naturally, passive resistance can avail nothing to a ruler.
('98', 237, 1, 8, 496248) Imagine a weak ruler being able to represent any people.
('98', 237, 1, 9, 496305) He would only degrade his masters who, for the time being, had placed themselves under his trust.
('98', 237, 1, 10, 496403) I know that the Sardar could never betray or degrade his trust.
('98', 237, 1, 11, 496467) I wonder if with a knowledge of this background to my statement, anybody would dare call my fast a condemnation of the policy of the Home Ministry.
('98', 237, 1, 12, 496615) If there is any such person, I can only tell him that he would degrade and hurt himself, never the Sardar or me.
('98', 237, 1, 13, 496728) Have I not before now said emphatically that no outside power can really degrade a man?
('98', 237, 1, 14, 496816) Only he can degrade himself.
('98', 237, 1, 15, 496845) Though I know that this sentence is irrelevant here, it is such a truth that it bears repetition on all occasions.
('98', 237, 1, 16, 496960) My fast, as I have stated in plain language, is undoubtedly on behalf of the Muslim minority in the Union and, therefore, it is necessarily against the Hindus and Sikhs of the Union and the Muslims of Pakistan.
('98', 237, 1, 17, 497171) It is also on behalf of the minorities in Pakistan as in the case of the Muslim minority in the Union.
('98', 237, 1, 18, 497274) This is a clumsy compression of the idea I have already explained.
('98', 237, 1, 19, 497341) I cannot expect the fast taken by a very imperfect and weak mortal, as I truly confess I am, to have the potency to make its proteges proof against all danger.
('98', 237, 1, 20, 497501) The fast is a process of self purification for all.
('98', 237, 1, 21, 497553) It would be wrong to make any insinuation against the purity of the step.
('98', 237, 2, 22, 497627) Q. Your fast has been undertaken on the eve of the meeting of the United
('98', 238, 0, 1, 497700) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 239
('98', 238, 1, 2, 497747) Nations Security Council 1 and so soon after the Karachi riot and Gujrat massacre.
('98', 238, 1, 3, 497830) What publicity the latter incidents received in the foreign Press is not known, but undoubtedly your fast has overshadowed all other incidents and Pakistan representatives would not be worth their past reputation if they do not seize the opportunity to declare that the Mahatma has undertaken the fast to bring sanity among his Hindu followers, who have been making the life of the Muslims in India impossible.
('98', 238, 2, 4, 498241) Truth takes a long time to reach the four corners of the globe.
('98', 238, 2, 5, 498305) But in the mean time your fast may have the unfortunate effect of prejudicing our cause in the eyes of the United Nations.
('98', 238, 2, 6, 498428) This question does not demand or need any elaborate answer.
('98', 238, 2, 7, 498488) From all I have known of the powers and peoples outside India, I make bold to say that the fast has created only a healthy impression.
('98', 238, 2, 8, 498623) Outsiders who are able to take an impartial and unbiased view of what is happening in India cannot distort the purpose of the fast, which is meant to bring sanity to all those who inhabit both the Union and Pakistan.
('98', 238, 2, 9, 498840) It is impossible to save the Muslims in the Union if the Muslim majority in Pakistan do not behave as decent men and women.
('98', 238, 2, 10, 498964) Happily for the cause, the Muslims of Pakistan, as Mridulabehn’s inquiry of yesterday made clear, have become wide awake to a sense of their duty.
('98', 238, 2, 11, 499111) The United Nations know that my fast aids them to come to a right decision and to give the right guidance to the two newly made Dominions.

('98', 239, 2, 3, 499730) BIRLA HOUSE, NEW DELHI, January 16, 1948
('98', 239, 3, 4, 499771) MIRA, I got your letter yesterday.
('98', 239, 3, 5, 499806) Evidently when you wrote it, you had no knowledge of this, my greatest fast.
('98', 239, 3, 6, 499883) Whether it will ultimately prove so or not is neither your concern nor mine.
('98', 239, 3, 7, 499960) Our concern is the act itself, not the result of the action.
('98', 239, 3, 8, 500021) The fast was commenced as usual with a service, part of which was singing of “When I survey’’ 1. It was well sung by Sushila.
('98', 239, 3, 9, 500147) There were some good friends at the service.
('98', 239, 3, 10, 500192) The company was impromptu.
('98', 239, 3, 11, 500219) No one was invited.
('98', 239, 3, 12, 500239) I am dictating this immediately after the 3.30 a.
('98', 239, 3, 13, 500289) prayer and while I am taking my meal such as a fasting man with prescribed food can take.
('98', 239, 3, 14, 500379) Don’t be shocked.
('98', 239, 3, 15, 500397) The food consists of 8 ozs.
('98', 239, 3, 16, 500425) of hot water sipped with difficulty.
('98', 239, 3, 17, 500462) You sip it as poison, well knowing that in result it is nectar.
('98', 239, 3, 18, 500526) It revives me whenever I take it.
('98', 239, 3, 19, 500560) Strange to say, this time I am able to take about 8 meals of this poison tasting but nectar like meal.
('98', 239, 3, 20, 500663) Yet I claim to be fasting and credulous people accept it.
('98', 239, 3, 21, 500721) What a strange world!
('98', 239, 3, 22, 500743) I shall watch and see how you can keep two typists constantly at their typewriters.
('98', 239, 3, 23, 500827) If it is only self deception and the typists a fraud on you, you will succumb and fall ill in the midst of attractive surroundings of your own choice.
('98', 239, 3, 24, 500978) One man claims that oil cakes are easier to make, cheaper in the end, and yet as effective as compost which requires a fair amount of technical skill for a kisan.
('98', 239, 3, 25, 501141) Your description of Goswami’s Goshala is tragic, if true.
('98', 239, 3, 26, 501199) It is enough to make one despair of the cow, the mother of prosperity, receiving her due in a country accused of cow worship.
('98', 239, 3, 27, 501325) There is no swaraj in such a land.
('98', 239, 3, 28, 501360) Your describing the Ashram as “Pashulok” is a magnificent idea.
('98', 239, 3, 29, 501424) It is poetic.
('98', 239, 3, 30, 501438) Don’t ever write Pashulok Ashram.
('98', 239, 3, 31, 501472) Ashram Pashulok with a dash in between is good.
('98', 239, 3, 32, 501520) Though now that I am thinking over it a little more deeply, Pashulok Ashram perhaps better represents your idea.
('98', 239, 3, 33, 501633) Since, however, it is your excellent idea that is to be carried out, your choice is to be final.

('98', 240, 1, 2, 501801) I see that you are destined for serving the cow and nothing else.
('98', 240, 1, 3, 501867) But I seem to see a vital defect in you.
('98', 240, 1, 4, 501908) You are unable to cling to anything finally.
('98', 240, 1, 5, 501953) You are a gipsy, never happy unless you are wandering.
('98', 240, 1, 6, 502008) You will not become an expert in anything and your mother is also likely to perish in your lap.
('98', 240, 1, 7, 502104) The only person and that a woman who really loves the cow will fail her.
('98', 240, 1, 8, 502177) Shall I pity you, the cow or me, for I, the originator of the real idea of serving and saving the cow for humanity, have never cared or perhaps never had the time to become even a moderate expert.
('98', 240, 1, 9, 502374) Satis Babu is better than you and me.
('98', 240, 1, 10, 502412) He adopted the idea and has become a fair expert, in fact the real source of milk among Muslims, not Hindus in Bengal.
('98', 240, 1, 11, 502531) It is he who has produced with amazing labour and concentration the only classic we have on [the] cow.
('98', 240, 1, 12, 502634) He is a genius.
('98', 240, 1, 13, 502650) I bow my head before him.
('98', 240, 1, 14, 502676) Correspondence with him will give you something.
('98', 240, 1, 15, 502725) Don’t rush here because I am fasting.
('98', 240, 1, 16, 502763) The yajna, as I have called it, demands that everyone, wherever he or she is, should perform his or her duty.
('98', 240, 1, 17, 502873) If an appreciable number do this, I must survive the ordeal.
('98', 240, 1, 18, 502934) Trust God and be where you are.
('98', 240, 1, 19, 502966) Pursue Goswami.

('98', 241, 1, 2, 503644) 250. LETTER TO PREMA KANTAK
('98', 241, 2, 3, 503672) January 16, 1948
('98', 241, 3, 4, 503689) PREMA, I got both your letters yesterday.
('98', 241, 3, 5, 503731) I had received the tilgur 1 on the Sankranti 2 day itself.
('98', 241, 3, 6, 503790) I saw that little bag on my desk.
('98', 241, 3, 7, 503824) The card pinned to it was on the other side.
('98', 241, 3, 8, 503869) I looked at it and read your name.
('98', 241, 3, 9, 503904) I remembered that it was the Sankranti day and understood.
('98', 241, 3, 10, 503963) I then got the parcel opened by Abha and asked her to distribute one piece as from you and the other one as from me among all those present, since, because of the fast, I myself could not partake of it.
('98', 241, 3, 11, 504166) Immediately the tilgur grains were distributed among all present.
('98', 241, 3, 12, 504232) I read your poem describing the significance of the tilgur, and was pleased.
('98', 241, 3, 13, 504309) I would never slight a religious celebration which was used to strengthen pure sentiments.
('98', 241, 3, 14, 504400) But celebrations which involve conspicuous enjoyments displease me.
('98', 241, 3, 15, 504468) Shankarrao Deo told me yesterday that you had written to him earnestly requesting him to inquire about my health daily and write to you.
('98', 241, 3, 16, 504605) If he has to do this, please consider that he will not be able to attend to his duty.
('98', 241, 3, 17, 504691) He has to go and visit different localities; should he neglect that duty in order to inquire after an old man?
('98', 241, 3, 18, 504802) Why need you also come running here to see how I am?
('98', 241, 3, 19, 504855) Please remember that there are a great many people here engaged in service of one kind or another.
('98', 241, 3, 20, 504954) If I let all of them come and see me, my fast would have to be indefinitely prolonged.
('98', 241, 3, 21, 505041) For they would then labour under the delusion that they were doing their all in looking after me and so neglect their real duty.
('98', 241, 3, 22, 505170) If you still feel that you must come, you are free to do so.
('98', 241, 3, 23, 505231) Both your letters are like beautiful poems.
('98', 241, 3, 24, 505275) I did not know that you had such great command over the language.
('98', 241, 3, 25, 505341) About the Socialists, I believe that they are self sacrificing, studious and courageous men.
('98', 241, 3, 26, 505434) I do not know what they have been doing.
('98', 241, 3, 27, 505475) If it is enough to know what appears in the newspapers about them, then that much I know, though not in great detail.
('98', 241, 3, 28, 505593) If they remain in the Congress and also serve on the Working Committee, I think they will strengthen the organization.
('98', 241, 3, 29, 505712) The reason is that such men would never seek to strengthen their party at the expense of the

('98', 242, 0, 1, 505852) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 243
('98', 242, 1, 2, 505899) Congress and, if they did, they would only weaken it.
('98', 242, 1, 3, 505953) If the converse also is true, those who follow my line of thinking should bear love towards the Socialists or other opponents and disarm their distrust through love.
('98', 242, 1, 4, 506119) Even the bitterest enemy could be won over through love.
('98', 242, 1, 5, 506176) 1 If we fail, we should know that the fault must be ours.
('98', 242, 1, 6, 506234) Our love in that case is imperfect.
('98', 242, 1, 7, 506270) The words attributed to me when I proposed Jayaprakash’s name as President must have been uttered by me, for they were true then.
('98', 242, 1, 8, 506400) 2 There is some change in the position now.
('98', 242, 1, 9, 506444) How it came about, we need not consider.
('98', 242, 1, 10, 506485) It may be that in my affection I may consider a person deserving to be President.
('98', 242, 1, 11, 506567) But his fitness to be President has nothing to do with my love.
('98', 242, 1, 12, 506631) Let me tell you that even I would not be able to describe the context and the manner in which I had made the remark.
('98', 242, 1, 13, 506748) It is true that the Working Committee is selected from among men belonging to the majority in the Congress, but it does not always happen that the majority elects the President from its own ranks.
('98', 242, 1, 14, 506945) A wise Committee would certainly select a capable and upright man from among the minority if they found one.
('98', 242, 1, 15, 507054) In this way alone would democracy succeed in the end.
('98', 242, 1, 16, 507108) A narrow minded majority is bound to invite disaster.
('98', 242, 1, 17, 507162) As far as I know, Jayaprakash’s views and policies are not harmful to the country’s interests, but his method is.
('98', 242, 1, 18, 507276) If, however, he becomes President, he must follow the Congress policy.
('98', 242, 1, 19, 507347) Anyway, he was wise enough to decline to be President in the prevailing atmosphere of opposition to him.
('98', 242, 1, 20, 507452) When a person who has opposed the official policies from outside becomes the leader of the whole country, he would if he has any touch of patriotism in him give up his opposition.
('98', 242, 1, 21, 507632) This is not a rule laid down by me, but the common rule in a democracy.
('98', 242, 1, 22, 507704) I am surprised how you failed to see this.
('98', 242, 1, 23, 507747) I have explained above how my mind was working.
('98', 242, 1, 24, 507795) But this does not mean that anybody should give up his views and act contrary to his own
('98', 242, 2, 25, 507884) 1 Vallabhbhai Patel, however, warned the Socialists in Bombay for pursuing their “obstructionist policy”.
('98', 242, 2, 26, 507990) On January 21, the Bombay Provincial Congress Committee expelled 17 Socialists from the Congress for “gross indiscipline” .
('98', 242, 2, 27, 508114) 2 At the Congress Working Committee which met to elect the new President following Jawaharlal Nehru’s resignation, Nehru was reported to have proposed the name of Acharya Narendra Dev.
('98', 242, 2, 28, 508299) Gandhiji had reportedly endorsed it and remarked: “You can have even Jayaprakash as President.”
('98', 243, 0, 1, 508395) 244 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 243, 1, 2, 508437) convictions out of deference to me or to anybody even more important than I. 2. In order to explain this 1 fully, I would have to write a treatise.
('98', 243, 1, 3, 508585) I am sure you don’t expect me to do that on the fourth day of my fast.
('98', 243, 1, 4, 508656) I don’t remember what I wrote on the subject earlier.
('98', 243, 1, 5, 508710) But in any case I would attach no importance to it.
('98', 243, 1, 6, 508762) What matters to me, and should matter to you, is what I believe today.
('98', 243, 1, 7, 508833) It would be a suicidal policy to take every decision by a majority vote.
('98', 243, 1, 8, 508906) In matters involving no moral principle, there is always room for give and take.
('98', 243, 1, 9, 508987) My own view is this, that if the provinces must be formally reorganized on a linguistic basis from right now, why not confirm what the Congress did in 1920?
('98', 243, 1, 10, 509144) 2 If that is done and if the boundaries of each province are also determined through joint discussions among the parties concerned, I think the problem of Maharashtra, Bombay and Gujarat can be solved.
('98', 243, 1, 11, 509346) But I think I must conclude the letter now, for Deo is waiting to carry it away.
('98', 243, 1, 12, 509427) I had sent for him.
('98', 243, 1, 13, 509447) 3. The Congress is still a political body and will remain so in the future.
('98', 243, 1, 14, 509523) When, however, it holds political power, it becomes one of the parties, no matter how big.
('98', 243, 1, 15, 509614) Those, therefore, who have perfect faith in ahimsa should not hold any office in the Government.
('98', 243, 1, 16, 509711) You could not have expected such a detailed reply in the present circumstances.
('98', 243, 1, 17, 509791) But the fact that I am able to dictate it shows that this fast is causing me the least pain.
('98', 243, 2, 18, 509884) Blessings from BAPU

('98', 243, 5, 21, 510021) NEW DELHI, January 16, 1948
('98', 243, 6, 22, 510049) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, I had not hoped to be able to speak to you today.
('98', 243, 6, 23, 510121) But you will be glad to know that today by God’s grace I feel my voice is stronger
('98', 243, 7, 24, 510204) 1 The addressee had sought Gandhiji’s opinion regarding the claim of Maharashtra over Bombay, firstly because of its geographical situation and secondly because Maharashtrians constituted the majority there.
('98', 243, 7, 25, 510412) 2 Vide “Congress Constitution Adopted at Nagpur Session”, December 1920.
('98', 244, 0, 1, 510485) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 245
('98', 244, 1, 2, 510532) than it was yesterday.
('98', 244, 1, 3, 510555) During all my previous fasts I never felt as strong as I am feeling today on the fourth day of the fast.
('98', 244, 1, 4, 510660) My hope is that if you will continue the yajna of self purification my strength to address you can remain to the end.
('98', 244, 1, 5, 510778) I may say that I am in no hurry at all.
('98', 244, 1, 6, 510818) Hurry will not help our work.
('98', 244, 1, 7, 510848) I feel ineffable peace.
('98', 244, 1, 8, 510872) I do not want that anyone should do anything incompletely and tell me that everything is all right.
('98', 244, 1, 9, 510972) When there is perfect peace in Delhi there will be peace all over India.
('98', 244, 1, 10, 511045) I have no wish to live if I cannot see peace established all round me, in India as well as in Pakistan.
('98', 244, 1, 11, 511149) This is the meaning of this yajna.
('98', 244, 2, 12, 511184) It is never a light matter for any responsible Cabinet to alter a deliberate settled policy.
('98', 244, 2, 13, 511277) 2 Yet our Cabinet, responsible in every sense of the term, has with equal deliberation yet promptness unsettled their settled fact.
('98', 244, 2, 14, 511409) 3 They deserve the warmest thanks from the whole country, from Kashmir to Cape Comorin and from Karachi to the Assam frontier.
('98', 244, 2, 15, 511536) And I know that all the nations of the earth will proclaim this gesture as one which only a large hearted Cabinet like ours could rise to.
('98', 244, 2, 16, 511675) This is no policy of appeasement of the Muslims.
('98', 244, 2, 17, 511724) This is a policy, if you like, of self appeasement.
('98', 244, 2, 18, 511776) No Cabinet worthy of being representative of a large mass of mankind can afford to take any step merely because it is likely to win the hasty applause of an unthinking public.
('98', 244, 2, 19, 511952) In the midst of insanity, should not our best representatives retain sanity and bravely prevent a wreck of the ship of State under their management?
('98', 244, 2, 20, 512101) What then was the actuating motive?
('98', 244, 2, 21, 512137) It was my fast.
('98', 244, 2, 22, 512153) It changed the whole outlook.
('98', 244, 2, 23, 512183) Without the fast they could not go beyond what the law permitted and required them to do.
('98', 244, 2, 24, 512273) But the present gesture on the part of the Government of India is one of unmixed goodwill.
('98', 244, 2, 25, 512364) It has put the Pakistan Government on its honour.
('98', 244, 2, 26, 512414) It ought to lead to an honourable settlement not only of the Kashmir question, but of all the differences between the two Dominions.
('98', 244, 2, 27, 512547) Friendship should replace the present enmity.
('98', 244, 2, 28, 512593) Demands of equity
('98', 244, 3, 29, 512611) 1 Lying in bed Gandhiji spoke this in Hindi on the microphone.
('98', 244, 3, 30, 512674) What follows had been dictated earlier in English and its translation in Hindi was read out at the prayer meeting.
('98', 244, 3, 31, 512789) The report in Harijan has been collated with the Hindi version in Prarthana Pravachan.
('98', 244, 3, 32, 512876) 2 For the Government’s earlier stand, regarding the payment of cash balances to Pakistan as enunciated by Vallabhbhai Patel, vide Appendix “Vallabhbhai Patel’s Statement to the Press”, 12 1 1948. 3 For the Government communique regarding the latest decision, vide Appendix “Government Communique”, 16 1 1948.
('98', 245, 0, 1, 513185) 246 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 245, 1, 2, 513227) supersede the letter of the law.
('98', 245, 1, 3, 513260) There is a homely maxim of law which has been in practice for centuries in England that when common law seems to fail, equity comes to the rescue.
('98', 245, 1, 4, 513407) Not long ago there were even separate courts for the administration of law and of equity.
('98', 245, 1, 5, 513497) Considered in this setting, there is no room for questioning the utter justice of this act of the Union Government.
('98', 245, 1, 6, 513613) If we want a precedent, there is a striking one at our disposal in the form of what is popularly known as the MacDonald Award 1. That Award was really the unanimous judgment of not only the members of the British Cabinet, but also of the majority of the members of the Second Round Table Conference.
('98', 245, 1, 7, 513913) It was undone overnight as a result of the fast undertaken in the Yeravda prison.
('98', 245, 2, 8, 513995) I have been asked to end the fast because of this great act of the Union Government.
('98', 245, 2, 9, 514080) I wish I could persuade myself to do so.
('98', 245, 2, 10, 514121) I know that the medical friends who, of their own volition and at considerable sacrifice, meticulously examine me from day to day are getting more and more anxious as the fast is prolonged.
('98', 245, 2, 11, 514311) Because of defective kidney function they dread not so much my instantaneous collapse as permanent after effects of any further prolongation.
('98', 245, 2, 12, 514453) I did not embark upon the fast after consultation with medical men, be they however able.
('98', 245, 2, 13, 514543) My sole guide, even dictator, was God, the Infallible and Omnipotent.
('98', 245, 2, 14, 514613) If He has any further use for this frail body of mine, He will keep it in spite of the prognostications of medical men and women.
('98', 245, 2, 15, 514743) I am in His hands.
('98', 245, 2, 16, 514762) Therefore, I hope you will believe me when I say that I dread neither death nor permanent injury even if I survive.
('98', 245, 2, 17, 514878) But I do feel that this warning of medical friends should, if the country has any use for me, hurry the people up to close their ranks.
('98', 245, 2, 18, 515014) And like the brave men and women that we ought to be under hard earned freedom, we should trust even those whom we may suspect as our enemies.
('98', 245, 2, 19, 515157) Brave people disdain distrust.
('98', 245, 2, 20, 515188) The letter of my vow will be satisfied if the Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs of Delhi bring about a union, which not even a conflagration around them in all the other parts of India or Pakistan will be strong enough to break.
('98', 245, 2, 21, 515409) Happily, the people in both the Dominions seem to have instinctively realized that the fittest answer to the fast should be a complete
('98', 245, 3, 22, 515544) 1 The Communal Award which was published on August 8, 1932 2 Gandhiji had gone on fast on September 20, 1932, in protest against the provision of separate electorates for the Depressed Classes.
('98', 245, 3, 23, 515738) He broke his fast on September 26, following the Poona Pact.
('98', 246, 0, 1, 515799) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 247
('98', 246, 1, 2, 515846) friendship between the two Dominions, such that members of all communities should be able to go to either Dominion without the slightest fear of molestation.
('98', 246, 1, 3, 516004) Self purification demands nothing less.
('98', 246, 1, 4, 516044) It will be wrong for the two Dominions to put a heavy strain upon Delhi.
('98', 246, 1, 5, 516117) After all, the inhabitants of Delhi are not superhuman.
('98', 246, 1, 6, 516173) In the name of the people, our Government have taken a liberal step without counting the cost.
('98', 246, 1, 7, 516268) What will be Pakistan’s countergesture?
('98', 246, 1, 8, 516308) 1 The ways are many if there is the will.
('98', 246, 1, 9, 516350) Is it there?

('98', 246, 4, 12, 516446) NEW DELHI, January 17, 1948 Let all the representatives give [their assurances] under their signatures.
('98', 246, 4, 13, 516550) I shall publish them.
('98', 246, 4, 14, 516572) I regard verbal assurances as worthless, only the written ones carry weight with me.
('98', 246, 4, 15, 516657) Suppose the [Muslim] refugees return from there and are killed on the way?
('98', 246, 4, 16, 516732) Even if they are allowed to come to Delhi, are they not supposed to go out?
('98', 246, 4, 17, 516808) Today tickets are not being issued to Muslims, what more need I understand?
('98', 246, 4, 18, 516884) If madness is the order of the day in Pakistan, should we also become mad?
('98', 246, 4, 19, 516959) I shall die if I have to.
('98', 246, 4, 20, 516985) Doctors cannot peep into my heart—which is above everything else.
('98', 246, 4, 21, 517051) No one need worry about me.
('98', 246, 4, 22, 517079) Our only consideration should be whether or not our conduct is right and whether we are purifying ourselves.
('98', 246, 4, 23, 517188) The purpose of the fast is that we should be awakened.
('98', 246, 4, 24, 517243) No doubt, Dr. Bidhan [Chandra Roy] has become anxious and he has conveyed it to Maulana.
('98', 246, 4, 25, 517332) But I do not want that anyone should persuade me to terminate my fast under false assurances.
('98', 246, 4, 26, 517426) If it happens it will further worsen the situation.

('98', 246, 7, 29, 517516) 1 Ghulam Mohammad, Finance Minister of Pakistan, referring to Government of India’s decision, said: “I am glad that Mahatma Gandhi’s efforts have been fruitful and that he has succeeded in making the Government of India see the error of its ways and save it from a most untenable position.” 2 Men and women filed past Gandhiji as he lay on his cot.
('98', 246, 7, 30, 517865) As Gandhiji’s kidneys were not functioning properly Abul Kalam Azad suggested that he should have some mosambi juice mixed with water.
('98', 246, 7, 31, 518000) Gandhiji refused to take anything but sour lime and said that he was aware of the damage to his body and that the reason for it was lack of perfect faith in Ramanama.

('98', 247, 1, 2, 518209) 253. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING1
('98', 247, 2, 3, 518240) NEW DELHI, January 17, 1948
('98', 247, 3, 4, 518268) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, God’s mercy it is that on this fifth day of the fast I can speak a few words without feeling exhausted.
('98', 247, 3, 5, 518394) 2 I have dictated the message for today which Sushilabehn will read out to you.
('98', 247, 3, 6, 518474) Whatever you do words must be backed by your full mind and heart, or it will avail nothing.
('98', 247, 3, 7, 518566) You will be making the greatest mistake if you think only of how I am to be kept alive.
('98', 247, 3, 8, 518654) It is not in any human hand to keep me alive or to kill me.
('98', 247, 3, 9, 518714) It is in God’s hands.
('98', 247, 3, 10, 518736) I have not the least doubt about it, and no one else should have the least doubt.
('98', 247, 3, 11, 518818) The meaning of this fast is that our hearts should be cleansed and awakened.
('98', 247, 3, 12, 518895) In that alone lies the good of all.
('98', 247, 3, 13, 518931) Please do nothing out of pity for me.
('98', 247, 3, 14, 518969) I shall fast for as many days as I can and if it is the will of God that I should die then I shall die.
('98', 247, 3, 15, 519073) I know many of my friends are distressed and want me to terminate the fast at once.
('98', 247, 3, 16, 519157) Today I cannot do so.
('98', 247, 3, 17, 519179) When the occasion for it comes I shall not persist in the fast.
('98', 247, 3, 18, 519243) Ahimsa requires us to accept our limitations and not to feel proud.
('98', 247, 3, 19, 519311) It calls for humility.
('98', 247, 3, 20, 519334) There is no pride in what I say.
('98', 247, 3, 21, 519367) There is only pure love in it.
('98', 247, 4, 22, 519398) I repeat what I have said before—nothing is to be done under pressure of the fast.
('98', 247, 4, 23, 519481) I have observed before that things done under pressure of a fast were undone after the fast was over.
('98', 247, 4, 24, 519583) If any such thing happens, it would be a tragedy of the highest degree.
('98', 247, 4, 25, 519655) There is no occasion for it at any time.
('98', 247, 4, 26, 519696) What a spiritual fast does expect is cleansing of the heart.
('98', 247, 4, 27, 519757) The cleansing, if it is honest, does not cease to be when the cause which induced it ceases.
('98', 247, 4, 28, 519850) The cleansing of a wall
('98', 247, 5, 29, 519874) 1 Over four thousand men and women had assembled for the prayers.
('98', 247, 5, 30, 519940) The Hindi version in Prarthana Pravachan has been collated with the report in Harijan.
('98', 247, 5, 31, 520027) 2 The health bulletin issued on January 17 read: “Mahatma Gandhi is definitely weaker and has begun to feel heavy in the head.
('98', 247, 5, 32, 520154) This is significant in view of the fact that the kidneys are not functioning well.
('98', 247, 5, 33, 520237) In our opinion it will be most undesirable to let the fast continue.
('98', 247, 5, 34, 520306) Therefore it is our duty to tell the people of all communities to take immediate steps to produce the requisite conditions for ending the fast without delay.” 3 Gandhiji spoke the above in Hindi on the microphone for about three minutes.
('98', 247, 5, 35, 520544) What follows had been dictated earlier in English and its translation in Hindi was read out at the meeting.

('98', 248, 1, 2, 520699) seen in the form of a white wash done to welcome a dear one does not cease when the dear one has come and gone.
('98', 248, 1, 3, 520811) This material cleansing is bound to require renovation after some time.
('98', 248, 1, 4, 520883) Cleansing of the heart once achieved only dies with one’s death.
('98', 248, 1, 5, 520948) Apart from this legitimate and laudable pressure, the fast has no other function which can be described as proper.
('98', 248, 1, 6, 521063) The number of telegrams coming from Rajas, Maharajas, and common people continues to increase.
('98', 248, 1, 7, 521158) There are telegrams from Pakistan too.
('98', 248, 1, 8, 521197) They are good as far as they go.
('98', 248, 1, 9, 521230) But as a friend and well wisher I must say to all those who reside in Pakistan and mould its fortunes that they will fail to make Pakistan permanent if their conscience is not quickened and if they do not admit the wrongs for which Pakistan is responsible.
('98', 248, 1, 10, 521487) This does not mean that I do not wish a voluntary reunion, but I wish to remove and resist the idea that Pakistan should be reunited by force of arms.
('98', 248, 1, 11, 521638) I hope that this will not be misunderstood as a note of discord, whilst I am lying on what is truly a death bed.
('98', 248, 1, 12, 521751) I hope all Pakistanis will realize that I would be untrue to them and to myself if out of weakness and for fear of hurting their feelings, I failed to convey to them what I truthfully feel.
('98', 248, 1, 13, 521941) If I am wrong in my estimate, I should be so told and if I am convinced, I promise that I shall retract what I have said here.
('98', 248, 1, 14, 522068) So far as I know, the point is not open to question.
('98', 248, 1, 15, 522121) My fast should not be considered a political move in any sense of the term.
('98', 248, 1, 16, 522197) It is in obedience to the peremptory call of conscience and duty.
('98', 248, 1, 17, 522263) It comes out of felt agony.
('98', 248, 1, 18, 522291) I call to witness all my numerous Muslim friends in Delhi.
('98', 248, 1, 19, 522350) Their representatives meet me almost every day to report the day’s events.
('98', 248, 1, 20, 522425) Neither Rajas and Maharajas nor Hindus and Sikhs or any others would serve themselves or India as a whole, if at this, what is to me a sacred juncture, they mislead me with a view to terminating my fast.
('98', 248, 1, 21, 522629) 1 Let them know that I feel never so
('98', 248, 2, 22, 522666) 1 Addressing a gathering of three hundred thousand people in Delhi, on January 17, Abul Kalam Azad said: “Before coming here I went to Gandhiji again and asked him what we should do so that he may break his fast.
('98', 248, 2, 23, 522879) He gave me seven tests which should be fulfilled by the people.
('98', 248, 2, 24, 522943) Assurances on these points, he said, must come from responsible people who can guarantee the proper fulfilment of these conditions.
('98', 248, 2, 25, 523075) No false assurance should be given.” The conditions were as follows: Complete freedom of worship to Muslims at the tomb of Khwaja Qutub ud Din Bakhtiar and non interference with the celebration of the Urs which was due to be held

('98', 249, 1, 2, 523347) happy as when I am fasting for the spirit.
('98', 249, 1, 3, 523390) This fast has brought me higher happiness than hitherto.
('98', 249, 1, 4, 523447) No one need disturb this happy state, unless he can honestly claim that in his journey he has turned deliberately from Satan towards God.

('98', 249, 4, 7, 523704) A correspondent writes: 2
('98', 249, 5, 8, 523730) When what is really true is stated, it is an improper use of the word to call it anger.
('98', 249, 5, 9, 523818) In anger a man does strange things.
('98', 249, 5, 10, 523854) If I have to close down the Urdu Harijan it becomes necessary for me to do the same with the Nagari Harijan.
('98', 249, 5, 11, 523963) There is no question of anger in doing the right thing.
('98', 249, 5, 12, 524019) What I consider proper, others such as the above correspondent, may not.
('98', 249, 5, 13, 524092) How am I concerned with that?
('98', 249, 5, 14, 524122) It is good if what we think right is considered so by the whole world but that does not happen.
('98', 249, 5, 15, 524218) Everything has at least two aspects.
('98', 249, 5, 16, 524255) Now it remains for me to tell you whether I should stop one or both.
('98', 249, 5, 17, 524324) It is true that when I started the Navajivan and Harijan in Devanagari there was no idea of both the scripts being used.
('98', 249, 5, 18, 524445) If there was any such idea I did not know about it.
('98', 249, 6, 19, 524497) there within a week.
('98', 249, 6, 20, 524518) Voluntary evacuation by non Muslims of all the mosques in the city which were being used for residential purposes or which had been converted into temples.
('98', 249, 6, 21, 524674) Free movement of Muslims in areas where they used to stay before the disturbances.
('98', 249, 6, 22, 524757) Full safety to Muslims while travelling by train.
('98', 249, 6, 23, 524807) No economic boycott of Muslims.
('98', 249, 6, 24, 524839) Full discretion to Muslims to invite non Muslims to live in areas occupied by them and freedom to Muslim evacuees to come back to Delhi if they so desired.
('98', 249, 6, 25, 524995) 1 The congregation filed past Gandhiji’s room, but they could not have a view of Gandhiji because of his extremely weak condition.
('98', 249, 6, 26, 525126) As the prayer meeting ended a mile long procession of the citizens of Delhi, shouting peace slogans entered the Birla House.
('98', 249, 6, 27, 525251) Jawaharlal Nehru addressed a few words to them.
('98', 249, 6, 28, 525299) 2 The letter is not translated here.
('98', 249, 6, 29, 525336) The correspondent had said that if any person other than Gandhiji had made a plea for discontinuing the Nagari Harijan and Urdu Harijan he would have considered it an expression of anger.
('98', 249, 6, 30, 525524) He suggested closing down of the English Harijan and continuation of other editions.

('98', 250, 1, 2, 525689) In the meantime the Hindustani Prachar Sabha was set up as desired by the late Jamnalal.
('98', 250, 1, 3, 525778) It made the publication of the Urdu edition necessary.
('98', 250, 1, 4, 525833) In my opinion it will be very unjust if the Nagari edition continues and the Urdu is stopped.
('98', 250, 1, 5, 525927) Because according to the Hindustani Prachar Sabha Hindustani can be written in the Urdu script as well as in the Nagari.
('98', 250, 1, 6, 526048) Therefore the journal should be continued to be published in both the scripts.
('98', 250, 1, 7, 526127) And that too at a time when people all over India say that Hindi alone should be their national language and it should be written only in the Nagari script.
('98', 250, 1, 8, 526284) It is my duty to tell them that this view is not right.
('98', 250, 1, 9, 526340) If my argument is correct it becomes my duty to retain the Urdu script along with the Nagari script, and if I don’t then I have to sacrifice the Nagari Harijan Sevak along with the Urdu Harijan.
('98', 250, 1, 10, 526535) Among all the scripts I consider Nagari as the best.
('98', 250, 1, 11, 526588) I make no secret of it.
('98', 250, 1, 12, 526612) So much so that I had started writing Gujarati letters in the Nagari script even while in South Africa.
('98', 250, 1, 13, 526716) I have not been able to continue it because of lack of time.
('98', 250, 1, 14, 526777) There is scope for improvement in the Nagari script as there is in almost all the scripts.
('98', 250, 1, 15, 526868) However, that is a different question.
('98', 250, 1, 16, 526907) I have mentioned it only to show that I am not at all opposed to the Nagari script.
('98', 250, 1, 17, 526991) But when the protagonists of the Nagari script oppose the Urdu script, I smell malice and intolerance in their attitude.
('98', 250, 1, 18, 527112) The opponents of the Urdu script do not even have the confidence that ultimately the Nagari script will have sway if it is more perfect than the other scripts.
('98', 250, 1, 19, 527272) Looked at thus, my decision must appear flawless as well as necessary.
('98', 250, 1, 20, 527343) I am right in my preference for Hindustani.
('98', 250, 1, 21, 527387) I do believe that as between the Nagari script and the Urdu script, the former will win.
('98', 250, 1, 22, 527476) In the same way if we leave out the question of the script and consider the language only, Hindustani will certainly win.
('98', 250, 1, 23, 527598) That is so because Sanskritized Hindi is wholly artificial while Hindustani is entirely natural.
('98', 250, 1, 24, 527695) In the same way Persianized Urdu is unnatural and artificial.
('98', 250, 1, 25, 527757) There are very few Persian words in my Hindustani; even then my Muslim friends and the Hindus of Punjab and the North say that they have no difficulty in understanding my Hindustani.
('98', 250, 1, 26, 527940) I can find few arguments in favour of Hindi.
('98', 250, 1, 27, 527985) Strange as it seems, when I defined Hindi for the first time at the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, 1 there was almost no opposition to it.
('98', 250, 1, 28, 528117) How the opposition started is a tragic story.
('98', 250, 1, 29, 528163) I do not even want to remember it.
('98', 250, 1, 30, 528198) I even said that the name Hindi Sahitya Sammelan was not, and even today is not, appropriate for the

('98', 251, 1, 3, 528464) But I had not become the president in order to propagate Hindi literature.
('98', 251, 1, 4, 528539) The late Jamnalal and other friends told me that whatever might be the name they were interested only in the national language and not in Hindi literature.
('98', 251, 1, 5, 528695) And it was for that reason alone that I started propagating Hindi in the South with great vigour.
('98', 251, 1, 6, 528793) I am writing this after prayer in the morning of the sixth day of my fast.
('98', 251, 1, 7, 528868) Many painful memories come to my mind but I do not like to recollect them.
('98', 251, 1, 8, 528943) I do not at all like this quarrel over the name.
('98', 251, 1, 9, 528992) Whatever may be the name, its activities should do good to the entire country or the nation.
('98', 251, 1, 10, 529085) We should not squabble over a name.
('98', 251, 1, 11, 529121) Is there any Indian whose heart will not exult after listening to Iqbal’s “Sare jahan se achchha Hindostan hamara”?
('98', 251, 1, 12, 529237) If there is any, I will consider him unlucky.
('98', 251, 1, 13, 529283) Should I regard these lines of Iqbal as Hindi or Hindustani or Urdu?
('98', 251, 1, 14, 529352) Who can say that it is not the national language or that it is not sweet or that it does not express maturity of thought?
('98', 251, 1, 15, 529474) It may well be that today I am alone in my view but it is clear that neither Sanskritized Hindi nor Persianized Urdu will win.
('98', 251, 1, 16, 529601) Victory will go only to Hindustani.
('98', 251, 1, 17, 529637) We shall forget this artificial quarrel and feel ashamed of it only when we forget our internal jealousies.
('98', 251, 1, 18, 529745) Now remains the English Harijan.
('98', 251, 1, 19, 529778) I consider it a very small thing.
('98', 251, 1, 20, 529812) I cannot discontinue the English Harijan.
('98', 251, 1, 21, 529854) Englishmen and Indian scholars of English believe that there is something special in my English.
('98', 251, 1, 22, 529951) My contact with the West is also widening.
('98', 251, 1, 23, 529994) I was never opposed to the British or any Westerner nor am I today.
('98', 251, 1, 24, 530062) Their welfare is as dear to me as that of my own country.
('98', 251, 1, 25, 530120) So English will never be excluded from my small store of knowledge.
('98', 251, 1, 26, 530188) I do not want to forget that language nor do I want the country to forget it or give it up.
('98', 251, 1, 27, 530280) My insistence has always been on not taking English beyond its rightful place.
('98', 251, 1, 28, 530359) It cannot become our national language or the medium of instruction.
('98', 251, 1, 29, 530428) In making it so, we have impoverished our languages.
('98', 251, 1, 30, 530481) We have put great burden on our students.
('98', 251, 1, 31, 530523) As far as my knowledge goes, such a sad spectacle is seen only in India.
('98', 251, 1, 32, 530596) Slavery to this language has deprived crores of our people of considerable knowledge for years.
('98', 251, 1, 33, 530692) We neither realize it nor feel ashamed of it nor repent it.
('98', 251, 1, 34, 530752) How strange it is !
('98', 251, 1, 35, 530772) Knowing all this pretty well, I cannot boycott English.
('98', 251, 1, 36, 530828) Just as Tamil and other languages are the regional languages and Hindi is the national language, who can deny that similarly English is an international language?
('98', 251, 1, 37, 530991) The rule of the British will go because it was corrupt, but the prevalence of English will never go.

('98', 252, 3, 6, 531392) BIRLA HOUSE, NEW DELHI, January 18, 1948
('98', 252, 4, 7, 531433) Dr. Rajendra Prasad opened the proceedings by narrating to Gandhiji how they had all assembled on the previous night at the former’s residence and after full discussion decided to sign the declaration 2 then and there.
('98', 252, 4, 8, 531652) But as representatives of
('98', 252, 5, 9, 531678) 1 Over a hundred representatives of various groups and organizations in Delhi, including Hindu Mahasabha, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Jamiat ul Ulema and others who had assembled earlier at Rajendra Prasad’s residence, called on Gandhiji at 11.30 a.m.
('98', 252, 5, 10, 531931) Prominent among others were Jawaharlal Nehru, Abul Kalam Azad, Rajendra Prasad, Shah Nawaz Khan, Hifzur Rahman and Zaheed Hussain, Pakistan’s High Commissioner.
('98', 252, 5, 11, 532092) The report in Harijan has been collated with the Hindi version in Dilhiman Gandhiji.
('98', 252, 5, 12, 532177) 2 The seven point declaration written in the Persian and the Devanagari scripts at Gandhiji instance, read: “We wish to announce that it is our heart felt desire that the Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs and members of the other communities should once again live in Delhi like brothers and in perfect amity and we take the pledge that we shall protect the life, property and faith of Muslims and that the incidents which have taken place in Delhi will not happen again.
('98', 252, 5, 13, 532641) “We want to assure Gandhiji that the annual fair at Khwaja Qutub ud Din Mazar will be held this year as in the previous years.
('98', 252, 5, 14, 532768) “Muslims will be able to move about in Subzimandi, Karol Bagh, Paharganj and other localities just as they could in the past.
('98', 252, 5, 15, 532894) “The mosques which have been left by Muslims and which now are in the possession of Hindus and Sikhs will be returned.
('98', 252, 5, 16, 533013) The areas which have been set apart for Muslims will not be forcibly occupied.
('98', 252, 5, 17, 533092) “We shall not object to the return to Delhi of the Muslims who have migrated from here if they choose to come back and Muslims shall be able to carry on their business as before.
('98', 252, 5, 18, 533271) “We assure that all these things will be done by our personal effort and not with the help of the police or military.
('98', 252, 5, 19, 533389) “We request Mahatmaji to believe us and to give up his fast and continue to lead us as he has done hitherto.”
('98', 253, 0, 1, 533499) 254 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 253, 1, 2, 533541) some organizations were not present in that meeting, they felt that they should not go to Gandhiji immediately with the signed document but wait till the remaining signatures were obtained.
('98', 253, 1, 3, 533731) They had accordingly met again in the morning when all those who were absent during the previous night’s meeting came and gave their signatures.
('98', 253, 1, 4, 533876) It was found in the course of the morning meeting, Dr. Rajendra Prasad reported, that even those who had some lingering doubts on the previous night were now confident that they could ask Gandhiji with a full sense of their responsibility to break the fast.
('98', 253, 1, 5, 534134) As the President of the Congress, Dr. Rajendra Prasad said that he had signed the document in view of the guarantee which they had all jointly and severally given.
('98', 253, 1, 6, 534298) Khurshid, the Chief Commissioner and Randhawa, Deputy Commissioner of Delhi, who were present had signed the document on behalf of the administration.
('98', 253, 1, 7, 534449) It had been decided to set up a number of committees to implement the pledge.
('98', 253, 1, 8, 534527) Dr. Rajendra Prasad hoped that Gandhiji would now terminate his fast.
('98', 253, 2, 9, 534597) Deshbandhu Gupta, speaking next, described some touching scenes of fraternization between the Hindus and Muslims which he had witnessed when a procession of about 150 Muslims was taken out that morning in Subzimandi and was received with ovation and offered fruit and refreshments by the Hindu inhabitants of that locality.
('98', 253, 3, 10, 534921) Gandhiji replying said: 1
('98', 253, 4, 11, 534947) I am happy to hear what you have told me, but if you have overlooked one point all this will be worth nothing.
('98', 253, 4, 12, 535058) If this declaration means that you will safeguard Delhi and whatever happens outside Delhi will be no concern of yours, you will be committing a grave error and it will be sheer foolishness on my part to break my fast.
('98', 253, 4, 13, 535277) You must have seen the Press reports of the happenings in Allahabad, if not, look them up.
('98', 253, 4, 14, 535368) I understand that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha are among the signatories to this declaration.
('98', 253, 4, 15, 535489) It will amount to breach of faith on their part if they hold themselves responsible for peace in Delhi, but not in other places.
('98', 253, 4, 16, 535618) I have been observing that this sort of deception is being practised in the country these days on a large scale.
('98', 253, 4, 17, 535731) Delhi is the heart—the capital of India.
('98', 253, 4, 18, 535772) The leaders from the whole of India have assembled here.
('98', 253, 4, 19, 535829) Men had become beasts.
('98', 253, 4, 20, 535852) But if those who have assembled here, who constitute the cream among men cannot make the whole of India understand that Hindus, Muslims and followers of other religions are like brothers, it bodes ill for both the Dominions.
('98', 253, 4, 21, 536077) What will be the fate of India if we continue to quarrel
('98', 253, 5, 22, 536134) 1 Gandhiji was so weak that his voice was hardly audible.
('98', 253, 5, 23, 536192) Pyarelal and Sushila Nayyar repeated aloud his words.
('98', 254, 0, 1, 536246) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 255
('98', 254, 1, 2, 536293) with one another?
('98', 254, 2, 3, 536311) I could not finish what I was saying as I was overcome by exhaustion.
('98', 254, 2, 4, 536381) Let us take no step that may become a cause for repentance later on.
('98', 254, 2, 5, 536450) The situation demands courage of the highest order from us.
('98', 254, 2, 6, 536510) We have to consider whether or not we can accomplish what we are going to promise.
('98', 254, 2, 7, 536593) If you are not confident of fulfilling your pledge, do not ask me to give up my fast.
('98', 254, 2, 8, 536679) It is for you and the whole of India to translate it into reality.
('98', 254, 2, 9, 536746) It may not be possible to realize it in a day.
('98', 254, 2, 10, 536793) I do not possess the requisite strength for it.
('98', 254, 2, 11, 536841) But I can assure you that till today our face was turned towards Satan, we have now resolved to turn towards God.
('98', 254, 2, 12, 536955) If what I have told you fails to find an echo in your hearts or if you are convinced that it is beyond you, tell me so frankly.
('98', 254, 2, 13, 537083) What greater folly can there be than to claim that Hindustan is only for Hindus and Pakistan is for Muslims alone?
('98', 254, 2, 14, 537198) The refugees here should realize that things in Pakistan will be set right by the example set in Delhi.
('98', 254, 2, 15, 537302) I am not one to be afraid of fasting.
('98', 254, 2, 16, 537340) Time and again I have gone on fasts and if occasion arises I may again do so.
('98', 254, 2, 17, 537418) Whatever therefore you do, do after careful thought and consideration.
('98', 254, 2, 18, 537489) The Muslim friends frequently meet me and assure me that peaceful atmosphere has been restored in Delhi and Hindus and Muslims can live in amity here.
('98', 254, 2, 19, 537640) If these friends have any misgivings in their hearts and feel that today they have perforce to stay here—as they have nowhere else to go to—but ultimately they will have to part company, let them admit it to me frankly.
('98', 254, 2, 20, 537860) To set things right in the whole of India and Pakistan is no doubt a Herculean task.
('98', 254, 2, 21, 537945) But I am an optimist.
('98', 254, 2, 22, 537967) Once I resolve to do something I refuse to accept defeat.
('98', 254, 2, 23, 538025) Today you assure me that Hindus and Muslims have become one but if Hindus continue to regard Muslims as Yavans and asuras, incapable of realizing God, and Muslims regard Hindus likewise, it will be the worst kind of blasphemy.
('98', 254, 2, 24, 538252) A Muslim friend presented me with a book in Patna.
('98', 254, 2, 25, 538303) Its author is an eminent Muslim.
('98', 254, 2, 26, 538336) The book says: “God ordains that a kafir — and a Hindu is a kafir—is worse than a poisonous creature.
('98', 254, 2, 27, 538438) He should be exterminated.
('98', 254, 2, 28, 538465) It is one’s duty to be treacherous to him.
('98', 254, 2, 29, 538508) Why should one treat him with any courtesy?” If Muslims still harbouring
('98', 254, 3, 30, 538581) 1 Here Gandhiji broke down due to exhaustion.
('98', 255, 0, 1, 538627) 256 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 255, 1, 2, 538669) such thoughts assure Hindus about their good behaviour, they will only be deceiving Hindus.
('98', 255, 1, 3, 538761) If you betray one you betray all.
('98', 255, 1, 4, 538795) If I truly worship a stone image I deceive no one.
('98', 255, 1, 5, 538846) For me God resides in that stone image.
('98', 255, 1, 6, 538886) I feel that if the hearts of both Hindus and Muslims are full of deceipt and treachery, why need I continue to live?
('98', 255, 1, 7, 539003) The telegrams I have received today include some from prominent Muslims.
('98', 255, 1, 8, 539076) They have made me happy.
('98', 255, 1, 9, 539101) It seems they have realized that the method adopted by them so far was not proper to run a government.
('98', 255, 1, 10, 539204) After listening to all that I have said, if you still ask me to end my fast I shall end it.
('98', 255, 1, 11, 539296) Afterwards you have to release me.
('98', 255, 1, 12, 539331) I had taken the vow to do or die in Delhi and now if I am able to achieve success here I shall go to Pakistan and try to make Muslims understand their folly.
('98', 255, 1, 13, 539489) Whatever happens in other places, people in Delhi should maintain peace.
('98', 255, 1, 14, 539562) The refugees here should realize that they have to welcome as brothers the Muslims returning from Pakistan to Delhi.
('98', 255, 1, 15, 539679) The Muslim refugees in Pakistan are suffering acute hardships and so are the Hindu refugees here.
('98', 255, 1, 16, 539777) Hindus have not learnt all the crafts of Muslim craftsmen.
('98', 255, 1, 17, 539836) Therefore they had better return to India.
('98', 255, 1, 18, 539879) There are good men as well as bad men in all the communities.
('98', 255, 1, 19, 539941) Taking into consideration all these implications, if you ask me to break my fast I shall abide by your wish.
('98', 255, 1, 20, 540050) India will virtually become a prison if the present conditions continue.
('98', 255, 1, 21, 540123) It may be better that you allow me to continue my fast and if God wills it He will call me.
('98', 255, 2, 22, 540215) Maulana Abul Kalam Azad remarked that the remarks to which Gandhiji had referred were abhorrent to the teachings of Islam.
('98', 255, 2, 23, 540338) They were only indicative of the insanity that had of late seized some sections of the people.
('98', 255, 3, 24, 540433) He was followed by Maulana Hifzur Rahman 1 who categorically repudiated the allegation that his co religionists did not regard India as their country.
('98', 255, 3, 25, 540584) They all wanted to remain in India as citizens of India with self respect and honour.
('98', 255, 3, 26, 540670) .Describing next the change that had come over the city as a result of Gandhiji’s fast, he said that they regarded it as a happy augury and a presage of things to come.
('98', 255, 3, 27, 540839) He joined Dr. Rajendra Prasad in his appeal that Gandhiji should break the fast.

('98', 256, 1, 2, 541121) reiterated that appeal.
('98', 256, 1, 3, 541145) Zaheed Hussain addressed a few words to Gandhiji.
('98', 256, 1, 4, 541195) He was there, he said, to convey to Gandhiji how deeply concerned the people in Pakistan were about him and how they were daily inundating him with anxious inquiries about his (Gandhiji’s) health.
('98', 256, 1, 5, 541392) It was their hearts’ desire that circumstances might soon prevail which would enable him to break the fast.
('98', 256, 1, 6, 541500) If there was anything that he could fittingly do towards that end he was ready and so were the people of Pakistan.
('98', 256, 2, 7, 541615) Zaheed Hussain was followed by Khurshid and Randhawa who on behalf of the administration reiterated the assurance that all the conditions mentioned in the citizens’ pledge would be duly implemented, and no effort would be spared to restore to the Indian capital its glorious old tradition of communal harmony and peace.
('98', 256, 3, 8, 541935) Sardar Harbans Singh endorsed the appeal on behalf of the Sikhs.
('98', 256, 4, 9, 542000) Rajendra Prasad again appealed saying: “I have signed on behalf of the people, please break your fast.” Gandhiji said: I shall break my fast.
('98', 256, 4, 10, 542142) Let God’s will prevail.

('98', 256, 8, 15, 542282) The Sikhs have shown courage in that they have eschewed anger.
('98', 256, 8, 16, 542345) This in truth is real courage.
('98', 256, 8, 17, 542376) This is the true teaching of Guru Maharaj.
('98', 256, 8, 18, 542419) That one Sikh is equal to one and a half lakhs of people has this very meaning.

('98', 258, 4, 6, 544442) NEW DELHI, January 18, 1948
('98', 258, 5, 7, 544470) BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
('98', 258, 6, 8, 544492) I have dictated a short message for today which Sushila will read out to you.
('98', 258, 6, 9, 544570) This is an auspicious day for me and it should be auspicious for you too.
('98', 258, 6, 10, 544644) This is also the birthday of Guru Govind Singh.
('98', 258, 6, 11, 544692) On this happy day I terminated the fast.
('98', 258, 6, 12, 544733) The kindness I have received from the people of Delhi, including the refugees, and from the Government, I shall never forget.
('98', 258, 6, 13, 544859) I experienced the same love in Calcutta.
('98', 258, 6, 14, 544900) How can I at this moment forget the great work Shaheed Saheb did in Calcutta?
('98', 258, 6, 15, 544978) 2 Had he not been there I could not have stood up there for long.
('98', 258, 6, 16, 545044) We had quite a few suspicions concerning Shaheed Saheb and we still suspect him.
('98', 258, 6, 17, 545125) But that should not concern us here.
('98', 258, 6, 18, 545162) We must learn that however bad a man may be we must treat him as a friend and work with him.
('98', 258, 6, 19, 545255) We must never under any circumstances treat anyone as an enemy.
('98', 258, 6, 20, 545319) There is Shaheed Saheb and there are four crores of other Muslims.
('98', 258, 6, 21, 545386) They are not all angels just as all the Hindus and Sikhs are not angels.
('98', 258, 6, 22, 545459) There are amongst us good men as well as bad men.
('98', 258, 6, 23, 545509) Only, bad men are fewer.
('98', 258, 6, 24, 545534) We also have in our country what are called criminal tribes.
('98', 258, 6, 25, 545595) We also have aborigines.
('98', 258, 6, 26, 545620) We have to live with them in harmony.
('98', 258, 6, 27, 545658) Muslims are a large community.
('98', 258, 6, 28, 545689) They are not confined to this land but are spread all over the world.

('98', 259, 1, 2, 546155) reason why we should be enemies of the Muslims who are here.
('98', 259, 1, 3, 546216) I am not a prophet but God has granted me the power of reason and a heart.
('98', 259, 1, 4, 546291) My reason and my heart tell me that if for some reason or other we are unable to forge friendship between Hindus and Muslims, not only here but also in Pakistan and in the whole world, we shall not be able to keep India for long.
('98', 259, 1, 5, 546521) It will pass into the hands of others and become a slave country again.
('98', 259, 1, 6, 546593) Pakistan too will become a slave country and the freedom we have gained will be lost again.
('98', 259, 1, 7, 546685) Many people have showered blessings on me today.
('98', 259, 1, 8, 546734) They have assured me that from now on Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims will live as brothers and under no conditions and on no provocation will the residents of Delhi, including the refugees, become enemies of each other.
('98', 259, 1, 9, 546949) This is not a small thing.
('98', 259, 1, 10, 546976) It means that from now on our endeavour will be to see that the people of Pakistan and India remain friends.
('98', 259, 1, 11, 547085) Although India has been partitioned because of our weakness we must unite our hearts.
('98', 259, 1, 12, 547171) If this is not the meaning of my breaking the fast, then I shall humbly say that you have not done a good thing in making me break the fast.
('98', 259, 1, 13, 547312) The spirit behind the fast must be preserved.
('98', 259, 1, 14, 547358) What happens in Delhi will happen in the whole of India.
('98', 259, 1, 15, 547415) And what happens in India will happen in Pakistan.
('98', 259, 1, 16, 547466) Have no doubt about it.
('98', 259, 1, 17, 547490) Let no one be afraid, not even a child.
('98', 259, 1, 18, 547530) So long, in my view, we were heading towards Satan.
('98', 259, 1, 19, 547582) From now on I hope we shall begin to move towards God.
('98', 259, 1, 20, 547637) But we must pledge that once we have turned our face towards God we shall never turn away.
('98', 259, 1, 21, 547728) When that happens India and Pakistan will unitedly be able to serve the world and make the world nobler.
('98', 259, 1, 22, 547833) I do not wish to live for any other purpose.
('98', 259, 1, 23, 547878) A man lives only to raise humanity.
('98', 259, 1, 24, 547914) The only duty of man is to move towards God.
('98', 259, 1, 25, 547959) One may call Him by any name—God, Khuda or Satshri Akal, but if He is not enthroned in one’s heart it is all delusion.
('98', 259, 1, 26, 548078) He is one though called by different names.
('98', 259, 1, 27, 548122) Then why should we forget Him and become one another’s enemies?
('98', 259, 1, 28, 548186) I do not want to make a long speech.
('98', 259, 1, 29, 548223) Let the Hindus take a pledge that they will not give themselves up to strife.
('98', 259, 1, 30, 548301) I wish that Hindus should read the Koran as they read the Bhagavadgita.
('98', 259, 1, 31, 548373) Let the Sikhs also do the same.
('98', 259, 1, 32, 548405) I wish too that Muslim brothers and sisters should keep the Granthsaheb in their homes and try to follow its meaning.
('98', 259, 1, 33, 548523) Let us uphold another’s religion as we uphold our own.
('98', 259, 1, 34, 548578) A good thing remains a good thing in whatever language it may be written.
('98', 259, 1, 35, 548652) The Koran is the same to me as the Gita or the Granthsaheb.
('98', 260, 0, 1, 548712) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 261
('98', 260, 1, 2, 548759) This has been my principle and whether you believe it or not I have been following it.
('98', 260, 1, 3, 548846) I tell you clearly that I do not offer worship to a stone, but I am a sanatani Hindu.
('98', 260, 1, 4, 548932) I do not hate those who worship a stone.
('98', 260, 1, 5, 548973) God lives even in the stone.
('98', 260, 1, 6, 549002) He who worships stone sees in it not stone but God.
('98', 260, 1, 7, 549054) If you do not see God in stone, how can you say that the Koran is a divine scripture?
('98', 260, 1, 8, 549140) Is this not idol worship?
('98', 260, 1, 9, 549166) If you learn this we will also learn that there is no difference between Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims.
('98', 260, 1, 10, 549266) All are brothers and must live together.
('98', 260, 1, 11, 549307) Then the barbarities that are perpetrated today, like men and women being thrown out of trains, will cease.
('98', 260, 1, 12, 549415) All will be able to live safely anywhere without fear.
('98', 260, 1, 13, 549470) I shall never have peace so long as the refugees who have come here from Pakistan do not return to their homes and so long as the Muslims whom we have driven out and who want to return cannot come back and live here in peace.
('98', 260, 1, 14, 549696) That is all I have to say.
('98', 260, 1, 15, 549723) May God grant good sense to us and to all everywhere in the world.
('98', 260, 1, 16, 549790) May He awaken and draw us all to Him so that India and the world may be happy.
('98', 260, 2, 17, 549869) I embarked on the fast in the name of Truth whose familiar name is God.
('98', 260, 2, 18, 549941) Without a living Truth God is nowhere.
('98', 260, 2, 19, 549980) In the name of God we have indulged in lies, massacres of people, without caring whether they were innocent or guilty, men or women, children or infants.
('98', 260, 2, 20, 550134) We have indulged in abductions, forcible conversions and we have done all this shamelessly.
('98', 260, 2, 21, 550226) I am not aware if anybody has done these things in the name of Truth.
('98', 260, 2, 22, 550296) With that same name on my lips I have broken the fast.
('98', 260, 2, 23, 550351) The agony of our people was unbearable.
('98', 260, 2, 24, 550391) Rashtrapati Dr. Rajendra Babu brought over a hundred people representing the Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, representatives of the Hindu Mahasabha, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and representatives of refugees from the Punjab, the Frontier Province and Sind.
('98', 260, 2, 25, 550645) In this very representative company were present Zaheed Hussain, the High Commissioner for Pakistan, the Chief Commissioner of Delhi and the Deputy Commissioner, Gen.
('98', 260, 2, 26, 550812) Shah Nawaz Khan, representing the Azad Hind Fauj (I. N. A.).
('98', 260, 2, 27, 550873) Pandit Nehru, sitting like a statue, was of course there, as also Maulana Saheb.
('98', 260, 2, 28, 550954) Dr. Rajendra Babu read out a document in Hindustani signed by these representatives, asking me not to put any further strain on them and to end the agony by breaking the fast.
('98', 260, 2, 29, 551130) Telegrams after telegrams have come from Pakistan and the Indian Union urging me to do the same.
('98', 260, 2, 30, 551227) I could not resist the counsel of all
('98', 260, 3, 31, 551265) 1 What follows was read out by Sushila Nayyar.
('98', 261, 0, 1, 551312) 262 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 261, 1, 2, 551354) these friends.
('98', 261, 1, 3, 551369) I could not disbelieve their pledge that, come what may, there would be complete friendship between the Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Parsis and Jews, a friendship not to be broken.
('98', 261, 1, 4, 551557) To break that friendship would be to break the nation.
('98', 261, 1, 5, 551612) As I write, comforting telegrams are deluging me.
('98', 261, 1, 6, 551662) How I wish that God will keep me fit enough and sane enough to render the service to humanity that lies in front of me!
('98', 261, 1, 7, 551782) If the solemn pledge made today is fulfilled, I assure you that it will revive with redoubled force my intense wish and prayer before God that I should be enabled to live the full span of life doing service of humanity till the last moment.
('98', 261, 1, 8, 552023) That span according to learned opinion is at least one hundred and twenty five years, some say one hundred and thirty three.
('98', 261, 1, 9, 552148) The letter of my vow has been fulfilled beyond expec tation through the great goodwill of all the citizens of Delhi, including leaders of the Hindu Mahasabha and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.
('98', 261, 1, 10, 552343) The result could not be otherwise when I find that thousands of refugees and others have been fasting since yesterday.
('98', 261, 1, 11, 552462) Signed assurances of heart friendship have been pouring in upon me from thousands.
('98', 261, 1, 12, 552545) Telegraphic blessings have come from all over the world.
('98', 261, 1, 13, 552602) Can there be a better sign of God’s hand in this act of mine?
('98', 261, 1, 14, 552664) But beyond the letter of fulfilment of my solemn vow lies its spirit without which the letter killeth.
('98', 261, 1, 15, 552767) The spirit of the vow is sincere friendship between the Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs of the Union and a similar friendship in Pakistan.
('98', 261, 1, 16, 552900) If the first is assured, the second must follow, as sure as day follows night.
('98', 261, 1, 17, 552979) If there is darkness in the Union, it would be folly to expect light in Pakistan.
('98', 261, 1, 18, 553061) But if the night in the Union is dispelled beyond a shadow of doubt, it cannot be otherwise in Pakistan, nor are signs wanting in that direction.
('98', 261, 1, 19, 553207) Numerous messages have come from Pakistan, not one of dissent.
('98', 261, 1, 20, 553270) May God, who is Truth, guide us as He visibly guided us during all these six days.

('98', 262, 2, 3, 553486) NEW DELHI, January 18, 1948
('98', 262, 3, 4, 553514) NARAHARI, So now you are able to write yourself.
('98', 262, 3, 5, 553563) I regard it as a great improvement indeed.
('98', 262, 3, 6, 553606) I expected it all along.
('98', 262, 3, 7, 553631) I don’t understand at all how you got the stroke.
('98', 262, 3, 8, 553681) How straightforward, truthful and pure your life has been.
('98', 262, 3, 9, 553740) Those qualities of your character have cured you in an incredibly short time.
('98', 262, 3, 10, 553818) But let not this happy outcome make you complacent.
('98', 262, 3, 11, 553870) Take as much rest as possible.
('98', 262, 3, 12, 553901) If you do, your asthma also may disappear now.
('98', 262, 3, 13, 553948) There is no need at all for you to run about.
('98', 262, 3, 14, 553994) As I was dictating the above lines in the morning before I broke the fast, I dozed off and the letter remained unposted.
('98', 262, 3, 15, 554115) The fast has now become a mere dream.
('98', 262, 3, 16, 554153) The physical effect remains, but it will probably disappear in about fifteen days’ time.
('98', 262, 3, 17, 554242) I will not write more today.
('98', 262, 3, 18, 554271) There is plenty of work lying in front of me.
('98', 262, 3, 19, 554317) I will not write to Vanudi now.
('98', 262, 3, 20, 554349) I had meant to.
('98', 262, 3, 21, 554365) But now that from calm I have entered storm, how can I get time?

('98', 264, 13, 22, 556480) MUNNALAL, Why did you use khadi paper?
('98', 264, 13, 23, 556519) For such purposes one should use only waste paper, which costs nothing.
('98', 264, 13, 24, 556591) Wait and see what happens here.
('98', 264, 13, 25, 556623) I should be very happy to have you with me.
('98', 264, 13, 26, 556667) I know your worth.
('98', 264, 13, 27, 556686) But just now this place is overcrowded, and I shall not be able to give you work which will do you justice.

('98', 265, 1, 2, 556919) only a few persons to accompany me.
('98', 265, 1, 3, 556955) Learn to read and write Urdu as soon as possible.
('98', 265, 1, 4, 557005) If living together Kanchan and you cannot free yourselves from passion you are not likely to do so living apart either.
('98', 265, 1, 5, 557125) You should be able to do so.
('98', 265, 1, 6, 557154) Only it requires mental self control of the highest order.
('98', 265, 1, 7, 557213) Being alone together has to be avoided.
('98', 265, 1, 8, 557253) Likewise all touch with impure thoughts must be avoided.
('98', 265, 1, 9, 557310) Whatever you do must have her fullest co operation.
('98', 265, 1, 10, 557362) She is right in believing you to be weak.
('98', 265, 1, 11, 557404) My intention ultimately is to keep you with me.
('98', 265, 1, 12, 557452) And I seem to be free, too.
('98', 265, 1, 13, 557480) I may, therefore, reach Sevagram even earlier than expected.
('98', 265, 1, 14, 557541) It is perfectly true that khadi, to which we had dedicated ourselves from the beginning, seems dead today.
('98', 265, 1, 15, 557648) The fault is entirely ours.
('98', 265, 1, 16, 557676) We have not mastered its science.
('98', 265, 1, 17, 557710) The science died with Maganlal.
('98', 265, 1, 18, 557742) We made ourselves, and remained, mere labourers.
('98', 265, 1, 19, 557791) Nayee Talim played some part in making the production of khadi a science, but we have still much distance to cover.
('98', 265, 1, 20, 557907) That is why I say that the most important work for the Ashram is to develop khadi into a science.
('98', 265, 1, 21, 558005) One must learn to do the spinning with perfect concentration.
('98', 265, 1, 22, 558067) Merely drawing yarn is not enough.
('98', 265, 1, 23, 558102) What this means, I will explain to you some time if you ask me, or will write.
('98', 265, 1, 24, 558181) But I don’t want to have you here just for this purpose.
('98', 265, 1, 25, 558238) Regarding Nayakum 1 the solution is clear.
('98', 265, 1, 26, 558281) Let him have whatever he wants for the Nayee Talim work.
('98', 265, 1, 27, 558338) There is no question of money at all.
('98', 265, 1, 28, 558376) If this means that you have to give up the land and the building in Sevagram, you may do even that.
('98', 265, 1, 29, 558476) Ask me what to do when such a situation arises.
('98', 265, 1, 30, 558524) I will guide you then.
('98', 265, 1, 31, 558547) There is, therefore, no reason for worry.
('98', 265, 1, 32, 558589) You must not lose your sleep because of the noise of any celebrations.
('98', 265, 1, 33, 558660) Pay no attention to it at all.
('98', 265, 1, 34, 558691) If, however, it becomes unbearable, draw Nayakum’s attention to it.
('98', 265, 1, 35, 558759) If Prabhakar has got the entire area paved with stones, he must have had some reason for doing so.
('98', 265, 1, 36, 558858) Discuss the matter with Sushila.
('98', 265, 1, 37, 558891) No notice need be taken of the foundation work having been wasted.
('98', 265, 1, 38, 558958) I have sent the reply to Prabhakar’s letter through Sushila.

('98', 266, 13, 28, 560230) Yet I used to dictate for Harijan and attend to some very important matters too.

('98', 267, 6, 13, 560823) The caste problem in Bihar is extremely tough.
('98', 267, 6, 14, 560870) Do whatever you can.

('98', 268, 12, 24, 562481) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, My thanks go out to the senders of the numerous wires from all over the world, from Indians and non Indians, expressing their
('98', 268, 13, 25, 562629) 1 (1880 1968); President of Vidharbha Congress Committee; member of Congress Working Committee, 1924 25 and 1931 34; India’s High Commissioner in Ceylon, 1943 47; member, Constituent Assembly; Governor of Bihar, 1948; member Lok Sabha, 1959 66; wrote a biography of Bal Gangadhar Tilak in Sanskrit verse 2 The addressee was sworn in as Governor of Bihar on January 12. 3 Gandhiji was carried in a chair to the prayer ground.
('98', 268, 13, 26, 563054) It being his silence day, his written speech was read out by Sushila Nayyar after the prayer.
('98', 269, 0, 1, 563148) 270 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 269, 1, 2, 563190) goodwill and anxiety.
('98', 269, 1, 3, 563212) These show the correctness of the step I had taken.
('98', 269, 1, 4, 563264) Not that I had the slightest doubt about it.
('98', 269, 1, 5, 563309) I had none about this, as I never have had about the reality that God is and that His most graphic name is Truth.
('98', 269, 1, 6, 563423) Now has begun a stream of wires of congratulations expressing relief.
('98', 269, 1, 7, 563493) These friends will forgive me for not sending personal acknowledgements.
('98', 269, 1, 8, 563566) It is physically impossible to do so.
('98', 269, 1, 9, 563604) I hope too that no such acknowledgment is expected by the senders.
('98', 269, 1, 10, 563671) I feel constrained to single out two— one from the Premier of West Punjab and the other from the Nawab of Bhopal.
('98', 269, 1, 11, 563785) They are today labouring under grave distrust.
('98', 269, 1, 12, 563832) Let the extracted passages speak for themselves.
('98', 269, 1, 13, 563881) If the senders were not sincere, they would have spared themselves and me on the solemn occasion that the fast was.
('98', 269, 1, 14, 563997) Here is the message from the Nawab of Bhopal:
('98', 269, 2, 15, 564043) Your appeal for a reunion of hearts of all communities cannot fail to find support from all people of goodwill in both Dominions as will also any appeal for an understanding and friendly relations between India and Pakistan.
('98', 269, 2, 16, 564268) We, in Bhopal, have been able happily to face our troubles during the past year in a spirit of concord, amity and goodwill between all communities with the result that not a single untoward incident has occurred to mar the peace of the State.
('98', 269, 2, 17, 564511) We assure you that we shall strive to further this friendly spirit with all the strength at our command.
('98', 269, 2, 18, 564616) I give the full text of the wire from the Premier of West Punjab:
('98', 269, 3, 19, 564682) West Punjab Ministry expresses deep admiration and sincere appreciation for your great gesture for furtherance of a noble cause.
('98', 269, 3, 20, 564811) This Ministry has always stood for the principle of doing everything possible to protect the lives, honour and property of minorities, and giving them equal rights of citizenship.
('98', 269, 3, 21, 564991) We assure you that this Ministry will follow this policy with redoubled vigour.
('98', 269, 3, 22, 565071) We are anxious to see an immediate improvement in the situation throughout the Indian sub continent which may enable you to break your fast.
('98', 269, 3, 23, 565212) No efforts will be spared in this province to help in saving a life as precious as yours.
('98', 269, 3, 24, 565302) In this age of senseless imitation, my warning is that it would be foolish for anybody to embark on such a fast expecting identical results in an identically short space of time.
('98', 269, 3, 25, 565481) If anyone does, he will face severe disappointment and will discredit what is a hoary and infallible institution.
('98', 269, 3, 26, 565595) Two severe qualifications are necessary—a living faith in God and a peremptory call from Him.
('98', 269, 3, 27, 565689) I am tempted to add a third, but it is superfluous.
('98', 269, 3, 28, 565741) A peremptory call from God within presupposes the rightness, timeliness and propriety of the cause for
('98', 270, 0, 1, 565844) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 271
('98', 270, 1, 2, 565891) which the fast is undertaken.
('98', 270, 1, 3, 565921) It follows that a long previous preparation is required.
('98', 270, 1, 4, 565978) Let no one, therefore, lightly embark on such a fast.
('98', 270, 1, 5, 566032) The citizens of Delhi and the refugees have a heavy task before them.
('98', 270, 1, 6, 566102) Let them seek occasions for meeting together as often as possible in perfect mutual trust.
('98', 270, 1, 7, 566193) It was a soul stirring sight for me to meet Muslim sisters in large numbers yesterday.
('98', 270, 1, 8, 566280) 1 Girls in my party told me the sisters were sitting in Birla Hourse uncertain whether they could come to me.
('98', 270, 1, 9, 566390) They were in purdah, most of them.
('98', 270, 1, 10, 566425) I asked them to be brought in and they came.
('98', 270, 1, 11, 566470) I suggested that they would not have the purdah before their fathers or brothers.
('98', 270, 1, 12, 566552) Why should they think me less?
('98', 270, 1, 13, 566583) And off went the purdah without exception.
('98', 270, 1, 14, 566626) This is not the first time that the purdah has disappeared before me.
('98', 270, 1, 15, 566696) I mention the incident to illustrate what genuine love, as I claim mine to be, is able to do.
('98', 270, 1, 16, 566790) Hindu and Sikh women should go to the Muslim sisters and establish friendship with them.
('98', 270, 1, 17, 566879) They should invite them on ceremonial occasions and be invited.
('98', 270, 1, 18, 566943) Muslim girls and boys should be attracted to common schools, not communal.
('98', 270, 1, 19, 567018) They should mix in sports.
('98', 270, 1, 20, 567045) Not only should there be no boycott of Muslims but they should be induced to resume their previous occupations.
('98', 270, 1, 21, 567157) Delhi is poorer for the disappearance of the exquisite workmanship of the Muslims.
('98', 270, 1, 22, 567240) It is a miserable and miserly thing for Hindus and Sikhs to wish to take away from them their means of livelihood.
('98', 270, 1, 23, 567355) On the one hand, there should be no monopoly and, on the other, there should be no attempt at deprivation.
('98', 270, 1, 24, 567462) In this great country of ours, there is room for all.
('98', 270, 1, 25, 567516) The peace committees 2 that have been formed must not go to sleep as many committees unfortunately do in all countries.
('98', 270, 1, 26, 567636) The condition of keeping me in your midst is that all communities in India live at peace with one another, not by force of arms but that of love than which there is no better cement to be found in the world.

('98', 271, 2, 3, 568140) With a view to enlarging the activities of the Kasturba Trust its Working Committee, on the advice of its Provincial representatives, has decided to celebrate the fortnight from February 22 to March 9 as the Kasturba Fortnight.
('98', 271, 2, 4, 568368) During the fortnight we should: (1) explain the aims and activities of the Trust in the villages;
('98', 271, 3, 5, 568466) (2) provide information about our activities so far;
('98', 271, 4, 6, 568519) (3) make special efforts to enlist women from rural areas for training in midwifery, basic education and as gram sevikas 1; and
('98', 271, 5, 7, 568647) (4) collect the required portion of the expenditure from the local sources in the districts and provinces in addition to the actual Trust fund sanctioned according to the budget for the year 1948.
('98', 271, 6, 8, 568844) According to the Gregorian calendar Kasturba died on February 22, 1944. According to the Vikram calendar this date falls around March 9 [this year].
('98', 271, 6, 9, 568993) It has been seen that its activities are neither given any publicity, nor has any publicity booklet been or is being printed.
('98', 271, 6, 10, 569119) I do not care for such things.
('98', 271, 6, 11, 569150) Moreover work in rural areas cannot be done in that way.
('98', 271, 6, 12, 569207) Those who are interested in this work can know about it from the annual report.
('98', 271, 6, 13, 569287) However, the difficulties of its representatives deserve to be considered sympathetically.
('98', 271, 6, 14, 569378) The programme chalked out for the Kasturba Fortnight is quite good.
('98', 271, 6, 15, 569446) The most important thing for its implementation is that the workers who are selected for the purpose should be interested in the work and should be familiar with rural life.
('98', 271, 6, 16, 569620) Such workers will find out if, in addition to the work done today, there is anything else they can do and they will consult the men and women in the villages about this.
('98', 271, 6, 17, 569790) It is possible that the villagers are not bothered about improving their lot.
('98', 271, 6, 18, 569868) Even if it is so the women volunteers will make a note of it in their reports.
('98', 271, 6, 19, 569947) So far we have organized a few camps, started a few maternity homes and a few kindergarten schools.
('98', 271, 6, 20, 570047) As this work is entirely new we have to proceed slowly.
('98', 271, 6, 21, 570103) What occupations can we introduce for rural women and children which will augment their income, increase their knowledge and improve their health?
('98', 271, 6, 22, 570250) As a matter of fact we know

('98', 272, 6, 8, 570554) NEW DELHI, January 20, 1948
('98', 272, 7, 9, 570582) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, The first thing I would say to you is that I hope that those who have signed the document have signed it with God as witness.
('98', 272, 7, 10, 570730) There are still voices being raised in Calcutta expressing the fear that what has happened here may all be a show.
('98', 272, 7, 11, 570845) If the people of Delhi and the refugees who have come here stand firm, then whatever may happen outside I am certain they will be able to save India as well as Pakistan.
('98', 272, 7, 12, 571015) Delhi after all is an ancient city and what is achieved in Delhi is bound to have an impact on the whole of India and Pakistan.
('98', 272, 7, 13, 571143) If you read carefully what the Sardar has said in Bombay you will realize there is no rift between Pandit Nehru and the Sardar.
('98', 272, 7, 14, 571271) They may talk in different ways but they do the same thing.
('98', 272, 7, 15, 571331) They cannot be enemies of the Muslims.
('98', 272, 7, 16, 571370) I have no doubt that one who is an enemy of the Muslims is also an enemy of India.
('98', 272, 7, 17, 571453) Let us realize the truth of this.
('98', 272, 7, 18, 571487) Elsewhere in the world they have already realized this except perhaps in America where Negroes are still lynched.
('98', 272, 7, 19, 571601) There are a good many white men there who do not consider this repugnant.
('98', 272, 7, 20, 571675) They have no shame in their hearts.
('98', 272, 7, 21, 571711) But elsewhere people do not approve of it.
('98', 272, 7, 22, 571754) They consider it barbaric.
('98', 272, 7, 23, 571781) Our own newspapers have described the acts of American whites as barbaric.
('98', 272, 7, 24, 571856) Though Americans are so much given to reform, they still indulge in such behaviour.
('98', 272, 7, 25, 571940) We assume we are better people and cannot do such things.
('98', 272, 7, 26, 571998) And yet, think of what happens here.
('98', 272, 7, 27, 572035) I would therefore ask your categorical assurance that irrespective of any injustice perpetrated here or elsewhere, you are not going to
('98', 272, 8, 28, 572171) 1 Gandhiji was carried in a chair to the prayer meeting.
('98', 272, 8, 29, 572228) As the microphone was not working and Gandhiji’s voice was feeble the substance of his speech was repeated aloud by Sushila Nayyar.
('98', 273, 0, 1, 572360) 274 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 273, 1, 2, 572402) seek revenge privately, but will leave it to the Government to deal with.
('98', 273, 1, 3, 572476) If this at least is agreed to, people can move about freely.
('98', 273, 2, 4, 572537) I told you it was possible I might go to Pakistan.
('98', 273, 2, 5, 572588) But I shall go to Pakistan only when the Government invites me as a friend of the Muslims as well as Hindus and the Sikhs.
('98', 273, 2, 6, 572711) Of course the doctors insist that I must first recoup from the effects of the fast which may take another 15 days and that during the next 15 days I cannot go anywhere or eat anything solid.
('98', 273, 2, 7, 572902) I can only take liquid diet which may be milk or fruit juice.
('98', 273, 2, 8, 572964) Milk can of course sustain a man all his life.
('98', 273, 2, 9, 573011) I may tell you that Panditji is a man who will do everything for the refugees.
('98', 273, 2, 10, 573090) If there is only one dry bed available he will offer it to a refugee to sleep on and himself go without sleep.
('98', 273, 2, 11, 573201) He says there is no room left in his house and still people keep coming.
('98', 273, 2, 12, 573274) He is our Prime Minister.
('98', 273, 2, 13, 573300) He has visitors, some of them Englishmen.
('98', 273, 2, 14, 573342) Is he to turn them out?
('98', 273, 2, 15, 573366) And still he says that he will spare for the refugees one or two rooms or whatever he can.
('98', 273, 2, 16, 573457) If other ministers as well as the army officers follow his example no one will be left unhappy.
('98', 273, 2, 17, 573553) I congratulate Jawahar and I congratulate you on possessing such a jewel.
('98', 273, 2, 18, 573627) I am told that wealthy people such as Birla will also do something in this direction.
('98', 273, 2, 19, 573713) After all when the Prime Minister can do such a thing, why cannot the others?
('98', 273, 2, 20, 573791) Thus vigorous efforts are being made to alleviate the distress of the refugees.
('98', 273, 2, 21, 573871) Let us learn from this that we shall not treat Muslims as enemies.
('98', 273, 2, 22, 573938) I have a letter.
('98', 273, 2, 23, 573955) In fact it arrived on January 16 when my fast was in progress.
('98', 273, 2, 24, 574018) I am told some wicked people forged a great quantity of currency notes and started selling them to the poor.
('98', 273, 2, 25, 574127) I humbly request
('98', 273, 3, 26, 574144) 1 At this stage there was a loud explosion.
('98', 273, 3, 27, 574188) Gandhiji remained unruffled and said to Manu Gandhi, who was visibly shaken: “Why did you get so scared?
('98', 273, 3, 28, 574293) Some military personnel must have been taking training in shooting.
('98', 273, 3, 29, 574361) What will you do if someone really comes to kill us?” He tried to pacify the people and resumed his speech when order was restored.
('98', 273, 3, 30, 574493) It was later discovered that a guncotton slab had exploded about 75 feet away from where Gandhiji was sitting and that it was part of a conspiracy to assassinate him.
('98', 273, 3, 31, 574660) The conspirators had planned to divert the attention of the people by the explosion.
('98', 273, 3, 32, 574745) Their original plan to throw a hand grenade from a servant’s room behind the dais having failed, they mixed with the crowd.
('98', 273, 3, 33, 574869) After the explosion Digambar Badge was to dash to the dais and throw a hand grenade at Gandhiji, but his courage failed at the last moment.
('98', 273, 3, 34, 575009) Six of the conspirators, viz., Nathuram Godse, Narayana Apte, Vishnu Karkare, Gopal Godse, Digambar Badge and Shankar Kistayya, escaped in a waiting taxi but Madanlal Pahwa was apprehended.

('98', 274, 1, 3, 575293) Can they not find some honest livelihood?
('98', 274, 1, 4, 575335) I must at the same time warn the poor not to be taken in.
('98', 274, 1, 5, 575393) They must not for ever remain simple and gullible.
('98', 274, 1, 6, 575444) I have a wire from Lahore, from the President of the Kashmir Freedom League.
('98', 274, 1, 7, 575521) He says:
('98', 274, 2, 8, 575530) Highly appreciate your magnanimous gesture for Hindu Muslim unity.
('98', 274, 2, 9, 575597) Kashmir is the root cause of the present tension and a stumbling block in the way of any rapprochement.
('98', 274, 2, 10, 575701) Must receive top priority if peace actually desired.
('98', 274, 2, 11, 575754) Withdrawal of aggressive Indian troops from Kashmir and handing it over to whom it rightfully belongs to is the only satisfactory solution of the problem.
('98', 274, 2, 12, 575909) The wire distresses me.
('98', 274, 2, 13, 575933) If there is no settlement over Kashmir, does it mean that things must continue in their present state?
('98', 274, 2, 14, 576036) Must Muslims be enemies of Hindus and Sikhs and must Hindus and Sikhs be enemies of Muslims simply on account of Kashmir?
('98', 274, 2, 15, 576158) Besides, I do not agree that the armed force our Government has dispatched to Kashmir has committed aggression there.
('98', 274, 2, 16, 576276) The armed force was sent in response to the appeals of Sheikh Abdullah, the Premier of Kashmir, and the Maharaja.
('98', 274, 2, 17, 576390) It is true that Kashmir should go to whom it belongs.
('98', 274, 2, 18, 576444) In that case all those who have gone there from outside, be they Afridis or any other, should get out of Kashmir.
('98', 274, 2, 19, 576558) I cannot object to people in Poonch revolting but I object to their rebelling in order to grab the whole of Kashmir.
('98', 274, 2, 20, 576675) I can understand it if every outsider leaves Kashmir and no one interferes from outside or sends help or complains.
('98', 274, 2, 21, 576791) But I cannot understand it if they say that they themselves will remain in Kashmir but that others should get out.
('98', 274, 2, 22, 576906) And to whom does Kashmir belong?
('98', 274, 2, 23, 576939) Right now I shall say it belongs to the Maharaja because the Maharaja still exists.
('98', 274, 2, 24, 577023) In the eyes of the Government the Maharaja is still the legitimate ruler.
('98', 274, 2, 25, 577097) Of course if the Maharaja is a wicked man, if he does nothing for the people, I think it is for the Government to displace him.
('98', 274, 2, 26, 577225) But so far no such eventuality has arisen.
('98', 274, 2, 27, 577268) If the Muslims of Kashmir say that they do not want the Maharaja, that they want to accede either to India or to Pakistan, no one can complain.
('98', 274, 2, 28, 577412) I have just emerged from a fast.
('98', 274, 2, 29, 577445) I am enemy of none.
('98', 274, 2, 30, 577465) So how can I be an enemy of Muslims?
('98', 274, 2, 31, 577502) Let them come and convince me of my error.
('98', 274, 2, 32, 577545) A Muslim gentleman of Gwalior has sent me a telegram from Ratlam.
('98', 274, 2, 33, 577611) In it he says:
('98', 274, 3, 34, 577626) We Muslim inhabitants Jahangirpur, District Ujjain, Gwalior inform your honour that on 15th and 16th instant our village was surrounded by a

('98', 275, 1, 2, 577809) Hindu party who beat us severely.
('98', 275, 1, 3, 577843) Several injured, one died.
('98', 275, 1, 4, 577870) Our crops and houses destroyed.
('98', 275, 1, 5, 577902) Officer of State not taking any action.
('98', 275, 1, 6, 577942) We are in danger.
('98', 275, 1, 7, 577960) Kindly arrange urgently.
('98', 275, 1, 8, 577985) It was sent on the 15th or the 16th of January when my fast was going on.
('98', 275, 1, 9, 578059) If this is true I must tell the Gwalior Hindus that they are going to undo the achievement of Delhi.
('98', 275, 1, 10, 578160) The correspondent says that those running the administration were of no help to them.
('98', 275, 1, 11, 578246) But how can this be?
('98', 275, 1, 12, 578267) If this happens in any part of India, then it is a matter of shame for the Government and for all of us.
('98', 275, 1, 13, 578372) I hope matters in Gwalior will be put right.
('98', 275, 1, 14, 578417) I see from the papers that all the Rajas of Kathiawar— there are more than two hundred of them—have met together and decided to merge all their States to form one large State which will have an assembly of its own.
('98', 275, 1, 15, 578632) 1 If this is true, it is a great thing.
('98', 275, 1, 16, 578672) I must congratulate all the Rajas of Kathiawar on this step.
('98', 275, 1, 17, 578733) In Bhavnagar the Maharaja has handed over all power to the people and has himself become a servant of the people.
('98', 275, 1, 18, 578847) I congratulate him on this great step.

('98', 275, 6, 24, 579034) MY DEAR SHAHEED,
('98', 275, 7, 25, 579051) I was much concerned about your financial obligations.
('98', 275, 7, 26, 579106) This letter is the measure of my concern.
('98', 275, 7, 27, 579148) I have seen many Muslim friends go under because of their extravagant habits.
('98', 275, 7, 28, 579226) Do not say you are no better than Hindus, etc.
('98', 275, 7, 29, 579273) The remedies you suggest are worse than the disease.
('98', 275, 7, 30, 579326) I would like you to do what I have induced my Muslim clients to do to their credit.
('98', 275, 7, 31, 579410) Thereby they gained in self esteem and in the esteem of their friends.
('98', 275, 7, 32, 579481) Honourable insolvency is the straight line.

('98', 276, 6, 10, 580078) You might not have broken it as you did through yours of 16th instant.
('98', 276, 6, 11, 580149) 1 From calm I have entered storm.
('98', 276, 6, 12, 580183) Thank God I have fairly learnt to face either with some amount of indifference.
('98', 276, 6, 13, 580263) I hope you are faring well in every respect.
('98', 276, 6, 14, 580308) I observe that you have lighted upon the fittest job for you.

('98', 276, 10, 16, 580399) 1 In response to an appeal issued by the addressee, special prayers were held in places of worship in Calcutta on January 16 for the fulfilment of Gandhiji’s mission.
('98', 276, 10, 17, 580566) Addressing one of these functions, C. Rajagopalachari said that Gandhiji had become insolvent because he had taken upon himself the debts of all other people.
('98', 276, 10, 18, 580725) His sorrows had accumulated like the interest of a money lender and he had gone to a great banker, namely, God, in order to repay all debts.
('98', 276, 10, 19, 580866) He expressed the hope that God would “help us in spite of the difficulties which appear to be insurmountable”.
('98', 276, 10, 20, 580977) At another meeting Rajagopalachari exhorted the Hindus to treat Muslims as their own kith and kin.
('98', 276, 10, 21, 581076) 2 Presumably the reference is to the addressee’s efforts to restore communal harmony in the strife ridden Calcutta.

('98', 278, 2, 3, 582256) NEW DELHI , January 21, 1948 I do not find this as shocking as you do.
('98', 278, 2, 4, 582327) 1 Because if I say no, the Sardar and Jawaharlal, who are hemmed in by so many worries, will be haunted by the added worry concerning my safety.
('98', 278, 2, 5, 582472) These friends are shouldering a great responsibility today.
('98', 278, 2, 6, 582532) I personally believe that I am in the keeping of Rama.
('98', 278, 2, 7, 582587) If He wants to take me away, even a hundred thousand men cannot save me.
('98', 278, 2, 8, 582660) But those in the Government do not share my faith in ahimsa and if they believe that I can be protected by these police guards, so be it.
('98', 278, 2, 9, 582798) Today perhaps I am the only one left who has faith in ahimsa.
('98', 278, 2, 10, 582860) I pray to God that He may grant me the strength to demonstrate this ahimsa even if it be in my own person.
('98', 278, 2, 11, 582967) So it is all the same to me whether there are or there are not all these police and military personnel posted here for my protection.
('98', 278, 2, 12, 583101) Because it is Rama who protects me and I become more and more convinced that everything else is futile.

('98', 278, 5, 15, 583246) 1 The addressee had expressed his fear that Gandhiji might not allow so many police personnel to be posted in the Birla House.
('98', 278, 5, 16, 583373) 2 After the bomb explosion on January 20 and on receiving information from the Bombay Government about a conspiracy to assassinate Gandhiji, Vallabhbhai Patel tightened the security measures at Birla House by posting army and police personnel along with plainclothes men.
('98', 278, 5, 17, 583645) As a precautionary measure the police wanted to search everyone entering the compound.
('98', 278, 5, 18, 583732) According to a statement made by Vallabhbhai Patel in Parliament on February 6 “the D. I. G. met Gandhiji and represented to him that there was danger and they should be allowed the facilities asked for, otherwise they would be discredited if anything untoward happened, but Gandhiji would not agree.
('98', 278, 5, 19, 584033) He said that his life was in the hands of God, that if he had to die, no precautions could save him and that he would not agree to anybody being restricted from coming to prayer meetings or anybody being allowed to come between his audience and himself.
('98', 278, 5, 20, 584287) I myself pleaded with Gandhiji for allowing the police to do their duty in regard to his protection, but without success.”

('98', 279, 3, 5, 584553) 1 But nothing is to be gained by our showing cowardice.
('98', 279, 3, 6, 584609) Someone tells me that in U. P. Hindus have started growing beards with the notion that thereby they will become brave.
('98', 279, 3, 7, 584728) But that is no way to become brave.
('98', 279, 3, 8, 584764) I read your Granthsaheb.

('98', 279, 3, 10, 584823) Nor shall I seek your permission to do so.
('98', 279, 3, 11, 584866) But the Guru has not said anywhere that you must grow beards, carry kirpans and so on.
('98', 279, 3, 12, 584953) If the Muslims treat the Hindus as poison you should not have persuaded me to give up the fast.
('98', 279, 3, 13, 585049) If that be so, food to me will be like poison.
('98', 279, 3, 14, 585096) If I know that it is all deception then all effort is futile.
('98', 279, 3, 15, 585158) I had told the Muslims so very clearly.
('98', 279, 3, 16, 585198) The spectacle today is one of supreme bravery.
('98', 279, 3, 17, 585245) From now on we will not seek revenge for enmity but we will return it with friendship.
('98', 279, 3, 18, 585332) I have given in to your pleading.
('98', 279, 3, 19, 585366) It is good you have told me everything.
('98', 279, 3, 20, 585406) At present there is peace all over Delhi.
('98', 279, 3, 21, 585448) What security can I need?

('98', 279, 5, 27, 585735) GANDHIJI: Mahatma Gandhi is neither an angel nor a devil.
('98', 279, 5, 28, 585793) He is a man like you....The slaughter that took place at Shekhupura was reminiscent of the outrage of Nadirshah 2. The Wah camp at Rawalpindi presented the same spectacle.
('98', 279, 5, 29, 585965) It can do no good to dwell on who has killed more people and where.
('98', 279, 5, 30, 586033) The Sikhs have shown great bravery today for which I am grateful.
('98', 279, 5, 31, 586099) In spite of their terrible sufferings they have accepted all my conditions for breaking the fast.
('98', 279, 5, 32, 586197) This is not a small matter.
('98', 279, 5, 33, 586225) I am doing all that any individual can do.

('98', 280, 1, 2, 586496) I had three Parsi visitors 1 who had come after meeting Mr. Jinnah and other Pakistani leaders.
('98', 280, 1, 3, 586592) They told me that [non Muslims] no doubt had suffered immense hardships in Karachi but the people there were also ashamed [of their deeds].
('98', 280, 1, 4, 586732) Nobody says that they are not at fault.
('98', 280, 1, 5, 586772) Now Mr. Jinnah has proclaimed that anyone found guilty of criminal actions will be severely punished.
('98', 280, 1, 6, 586874) A lot of plundered goods have been seized from the homes of officials.
('98', 280, 1, 7, 586945) I assure you that I shall do as much as I can.
('98', 280, 1, 8, 586992) For I have to do or die.
('98', 280, 1, 9, 587017) You will have seen what happened yesterday, but I know that if there is work that God wants me to do I must do it.

('98', 280, 5, 13, 587201) NEW DELHI , January 21, 1948
('98', 280, 6, 14, 587230) BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
('98', 280, 7, 15, 587252) First of all I must ask you to forgive me for being late by ten minutes.
('98', 280, 7, 16, 587325) I am not well and so could not be punctual.
('98', 280, 7, 17, 587369) Let me first deal with the bomb incident of yesterday.
('98', 280, 7, 18, 587424) People have been sending me wires congratulating me and praising me.
('98', 280, 7, 19, 587493) In fact I deserve no congratulations.
('98', 280, 7, 20, 587531) I displayed no bravery.
('98', 280, 7, 21, 587555) I thought it was part of army practice somewhere.
('98', 280, 7, 22, 587605) I only came to know later that it was a bomb and that it might have killed me if God had not willed it that I should live.
('98', 280, 7, 23, 587728) But if a bomb explodes in front of me and if I am not scared and succumb, then you will be able to say that I died with a smile on my face.
('98', 280, 7, 24, 587868) Today I do not yet deserve to be so praised.
('98', 280, 7, 25, 587913) You should not have any kind of hate against the person who was responsible for this.
('98', 280, 7, 26, 587999) He had taken it for granted that I am an enemy of Hinduism.
('98', 280, 7, 27, 588059) Is it not said in chapter IV 2 of the Gita that whenever the wicked become too powerful and harm dharma God sends someone to destroy them?
('98', 280, 7, 28, 588198) The man who exploded the bomb obviously thinks that he has been sent by God to destroy me.
('98', 280, 7, 29, 588289) I have not seen him.
('98', 280, 7, 30, 588310) But I am told that is what
('98', 280, 8, 31, 588337) 1 Jamshedji Mehta, Jehangir Patel and Dinshaw Mehta 2 verse 8
('98', 281, 0, 1, 588399) 282 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 281, 1, 2, 588441) he said when questioned by the police.
('98', 281, 1, 3, 588480) He was well dressed too.
('98', 281, 1, 4, 588505) But I am sure God is not out of His mind to continue sending such men.
('98', 281, 1, 5, 588576) If we do not like a man, does it mean that he is wicked?
('98', 281, 1, 6, 588633) Even if I become wicked in the eyes of everyone I shall not be considered such in the court of God.
('98', 281, 1, 7, 588733) If then someone kills me, taking me for a wicked man, will he not have to answer before God?
('98', 281, 1, 8, 588826) Let us pray that God may grant him good sense.
('98', 281, 1, 9, 588873) It seems he had lodged himself in a mosque.
('98', 281, 1, 10, 588917) In this he had offended against India, against God and against Hinduism.
('98', 281, 1, 11, 588990) If everyone thus takes to occupying mosques and, when stopped, assails police officers it will never do.
('98', 281, 1, 12, 589095) This is not the sort of thing that God will prompt anyone to do.
('98', 281, 1, 13, 589160) When he says he was doing the bidding of God he is only making God an accomplice in a wicked deed.
('98', 281, 1, 14, 589259) But it cannot be so.
('98', 281, 1, 15, 589280) Therefore those who are behind him or whose tool he is, should know that this sort of thing will not save Hinduism.If Hinduism has to be saved it will be saved through such work as I am doing.
('98', 281, 1, 16, 589473) I have been imbibing Hindu dharma right from my childhood.
('98', 281, 1, 17, 589532) My nurse, who literally brought me up, taught me to invoke Rama whenever I had any fears.
('98', 281, 1, 18, 589622) With God’s grace, later in life I came in contact with noble and good persons—who were Hindus.
('98', 281, 1, 19, 589717) I had the good company of Christian and Muslim friends as well, who too could not influence me otherwise.
('98', 281, 1, 20, 589823) Therefore having passed all the tests I am as staunch a Hindu today as intuitively I was at the age of five or six.
('98', 281, 1, 21, 589939) If God deems it fit to make anyone the instrument for saving Hindu dharma, it could be none but me.
('98', 281, 1, 22, 590039) Do you want to annihilate Hindu dharma by killing a devout Hindu like me?
('98', 281, 1, 23, 590113) Some Sikhs came to me and asked me if I suspected that a Sikh was implicated in the deed.
('98', 281, 1, 24, 590203) I know he was not a Sikh.
('98', 281, 1, 25, 590229) But what even if he was?
('98', 281, 1, 26, 590254) What does it matter if he was a Hindu or a Muslim?
('98', 281, 1, 27, 590305) May God bless him with good sense.
('98', 281, 1, 28, 590340) I have told the Inspector General of Police not to harass the man.
('98', 281, 1, 29, 590407) They should try to win him over.
('98', 281, 1, 30, 590440) I cannot ask that he should be released because that is not my function.
('98', 281, 1, 31, 590513) If he can realize that he has committed a crime against Hinduism, against India, against the Muslims and against the whole world, we should not be severe with him.
('98', 281, 1, 32, 590677) We should pity him.
('98', 281, 1, 33, 590697) If you all think that my fast was worthless and at the same time you would not let me die because you would not want to take the blame for it, then I think you have deceived me as well as yourselves and what the man did was only right and no sin.
('98', 281, 1, 34, 590944) If you whole heartedly disapprove of his action his heart will change of itself, because in this world sin cannot stand by itself.
('98', 281, 1, 35, 591075) It always wants support.
('98', 281, 1, 36, 591100) Only God and his devotees are self sustained.
('98', 282, 0, 1, 591146) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 283
('98', 282, 1, 2, 591193) This is the premise from which our non co operation is derived.
('98', 282, 1, 3, 591257) I pray to God to give us enough strength that we may maintain our self possession and continue the prayer and not budge from our places, even if a bomb should be thrown in our midst, and even if a police party should come and try to make us leave.
('98', 282, 1, 4, 591505) Only then shall I deserve to be congratulated.
('98', 282, 1, 5, 591552) I want to go on uttering Ramanama even if there should be shooting taking place all around me.
('98', 282, 1, 6, 591647) Yesterday an illiterate woman 1 displayed courage in having the culprit arrested.
('98', 282, 1, 7, 591729) I admire her courage.
('98', 282, 1, 8, 591751) It is my belief that however illiterate or uneducated one may be, it does not matter so long as one has a stout heart.
('98', 282, 1, 9, 591870) Bahawalpur people have written urging that we should hurry and get them out or they will all be killed.
('98', 282, 1, 10, 591974) I must ask them not to become panicky.
('98', 282, 1, 11, 592013) I have another wire from the Nawab Saheb only today in which he says that he is doing his utmost for these people.
('98', 282, 1, 12, 592128) I have also not forgotten them.
('98', 282, 1, 13, 592160) I have also a telegram from Bombay sent by Sindhi Sikhs there.
('98', 282, 1, 14, 592223) They say there are still some fifteen thousand Sikhs in Sind.
('98', 282, 1, 15, 592285) Some have already been slaughtered.
('98', 282, 1, 16, 592321) Their lives and their faith are in peril.
('98', 282, 1, 17, 592363) They request that some arrangement should be made to get them out of Sind, if possible by plane.
('98', 282, 1, 18, 592460) What I say here will reach them.
('98', 282, 1, 19, 592493) Even a telegram takes longer.
('98', 282, 1, 20, 592523) I shall not tolerate it if these 15,000 Sikhs are cut down or their faith or dignity attacked.
('98', 282, 1, 21, 592618) I will do what a single individual can do.
('98', 282, 1, 22, 592661) Panditji himself thinks of everybody.
('98', 282, 1, 23, 592699) I shall request the Pakistan and Sind Governments to reassure the Sikhs that so long as they are there they are not in any kind of danger.
('98', 282, 1, 24, 592838) If they cannot give such an assurance they should collect them in one place or send them to India under escort.
('98', 282, 1, 25, 592950) Sikhs are a brave people.
('98', 282, 1, 26, 592976) Who can dare to attack their faith?
('98', 282, 1, 27, 593012) Let the Sikh brethren be reassured.
('98', 282, 1, 28, 593048) I have sent some Parsee friends to see their condition.
('98', 282, 1, 29, 593104) A correspondent writes that when I was in jail in 1942 people had indulged in acts which were sometimes violent.
('98', 282, 1, 30, 593217) If I should die while fasting there would be such a wave of violence in the country that even my God would cry out.
('98', 282, 1, 31, 593333) My fast therefore would be violent and I should give it up.
('98', 282, 1, 32, 593393) There is love as well as ignorance behind what the correspondent says.
('98', 282, 1, 33, 593464) It is true that there was violence in the country following my imprisonment.
('98', 282, 1, 34, 593541) The present situation is a consequence of
('98', 282, 2, 35, 593583) 1 Sulochana Devi
('98', 283, 0, 1, 593600) 284 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 283, 1, 2, 593642) Had the country then remained wholly non violent, we would not have been in the plight that we are in today.
('98', 283, 1, 3, 593751) I have also thought over the possibility that after I am no more there may be further strife.
('98', 283, 1, 4, 593845) If God wants to save me He will do so.
('98', 283, 1, 5, 593884) The death of a non violent man will always have desirable consequences.
('98', 283, 1, 6, 593956) But when Krishna was no more the Yadavas did not become better and purer.
('98', 283, 1, 7, 594030) They destroyed themselves in fratricidal strife.
('98', 283, 1, 8, 594079) I shall not weep over it.
('98', 283, 1, 9, 594105) But I am a poor lowly individual.
('98', 283, 1, 10, 594139) Why should anyone take to fighting after I am gone?
('98', 283, 1, 11, 594191) But God sometimes makes the very lowly His instrument.
('98', 283, 1, 12, 594246) I am told Hindus and Muslims will not fight here any more.
('98', 283, 1, 13, 594305) Muslim women too have begun to come out of their houses.
('98', 283, 1, 14, 594362) This makes me happy.
('98', 283, 1, 15, 594383) I must ask all to make their hearts the temple of God.

('98', 285, 2, 3, 596006) NEW DELHI , January 22, 1948
('98', 285, 3, 4, 596035) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, By the grace of God, I am as you see slowly recovering my strength.
('98', 285, 3, 5, 596125) 1 I hope very soon I shall be as strong as ever.
('98', 285, 3, 6, 596174) But it is in the hands of God.
('98', 285, 3, 7, 596205) A friend writes saying that Jawaharlal may spare a room or two in his large house for the refugees, and other ministers, army officers and Government executives may also similarly spare some accommodation in their houses, but then, he asks, how many refugees can we house in this way?
('98', 285, 3, 8, 596490) There are many who give verbal assurance but only a few act on them.
('98', 285, 3, 9, 596559) I agree that only a few thousand refugees can be housed in this way.
('98', 285, 3, 10, 596628) But that is not important.
('98', 285, 3, 11, 596655) What is important is that leading men and officers will have set an example.
('98', 285, 3, 12, 596732) In England if the King makes the smallest sacrifice, like giving up a glass of wine, the gesture is greatly appreciated.
('98', 285, 3, 13, 596853) Every civilized country appreciates such gestures.
('98', 285, 3, 14, 596904) It also creates a good impression among the refugees who feel that people are doing the best for them and they too should try and face difficulties bravely.
('98', 285, 3, 15, 597061) But if this leads to people rushing to Delhi in the belief that they will be better looked after here it will spoil things.
('98', 285, 3, 16, 597185) Another difficulty has been placed before me.
('98', 285, 3, 17, 597231) People say that formerly the Congress could collect even a lakh of rupees only with the greatest difficulty.
('98', 285, 3, 18, 597340) Today it can disburse crores of rupees.
('98', 285, 3, 19, 597380) This is the power which it had been fighting for.
('98', 285, 3, 20, 597430) But they are following in the footsteps of the British Government in the matter of spending lavishly.
('98', 285, 3, 21, 597532) Some say that since we are now running the Government we must spend lavishly and live in style, otherwise our prestige outside India will suffer.
('98', 285, 3, 22, 597678) But if we want to compete with the British in the lavishness they show in maintaining their dignity, we shall have to be as well off as they are.
('98', 285, 3, 23, 597824) But our per capita income is nowhere near that of England.
('98', 285, 3, 24, 597883) We are an extremely poor country.
('98', 285, 3, 25, 597917) If, therefore, we compete with others in the matter of spending we shall be destroyed.
('98', 285, 4, 26, 598004) 1 For the first time after his fast, Gandhiji was able to walk up to the prayer ground.
('98', 286, 0, 1, 598092) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 287
('98', 286, 1, 2, 598139) hope our representatives abroad will realize this.
('98', 286, 1, 3, 598190) They should not try to compete with America in throwing dinners, banquets and parties.
('98', 286, 1, 4, 598277) That even our self sacrificing Congressmen should fall into such erroneous ways is something that should make us sit up and think.
('98', 286, 1, 5, 598408) People also object to ministers getting higher salaries than other people.
('98', 286, 1, 6, 598483) If Sardar Patel is paid Rs. 1,500 a month, then they say they should at least be paid Rs. 500. This is not the way of living in India.
('98', 286, 1, 7, 598618) When we are all trying to purify ourselves why should we think along such lines?
('98', 286, 1, 8, 598699) We do not judge people by the money they have.
('98', 286, 1, 9, 598746) I have read out to you the wire describing the plight of certain Muslims in Gwalior.
('98', 286, 1, 10, 598831) 1 A worker from there came to me saying that he had good news.
('98', 286, 1, 11, 598894) He says that the Maharaja of Gwalior has handed over all power to the people.
('98', 286, 1, 12, 598972) 2 But if the Praja Mandal people show discrimination and drive out Muslims, how can I be happy over it?
('98', 286, 1, 13, 599076) I shall be happy if you tell me that there will be no discrimination and that no ill will would be shown against anyone, be he a Hindu or Muslim or Parsi or Christian.
('98', 286, 1, 14, 599244) Then I shall congratulate you and bless you.
('98', 286, 1, 15, 599289) The Maharaja has become the servant of the people.
('98', 286, 1, 16, 599340) In this yajna of self purification everyone, including the ruler and the ruled, should participate.
('98', 286, 1, 17, 599440) Only then shall we be able to stand before the world.
('98', 286, 1, 18, 599494) If we want to carry the world on the right path and save it there is no other way before us.

('98', 286, 5, 23, 599687) A young man 4 writes 5:
('98', 286, 6, 24, 599711) Today at noon I learnt that you had commenced fasting.
('98', 286, 6, 25, 599766) I resisted the temptation of writing to you during the fast.
('98', 286, 6, 26, 599827) But I can do so no longer.
('98', 286, 6, 27, 599854) 1. It is idle to think that a fast of five or seven days on your part can establish heart unity between the Hindus and Muslims.
('98', 286, 6, 28, 599982) What your fast will do will be to make the Hindus suppress their anger .
('98', 286, 6, 29, 600055) And I think it

('98', 287, 0, 1, 600440) 288 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 287, 1, 2, 600482) should be enough to induce you to end your fast.
('98', 287, 1, 3, 600531) 2. By your penance you have gained a unique place in the hearts and affection of the people.
('98', 287, 1, 4, 600624) .They will, therefore, suppress their anger and hatred in order to save your life.
('98', 287, 1, 5, 600707) But this pent up anger is sure to burst out at the first opportunity.
('98', 287, 1, 6, 600777) 3. If anger and hatred are to be purged out of the hearts of the people, the Government ought to teach them to base their lives on constructive work.
('98', 287, 1, 7, 600927) .In America, they are tending more and more to revert to natural manures.
('98', 287, 1, 8, 601001) We seem to be going in for the production of chemical fertilizers.
('98', 287, 1, 9, 601068) 4. I can say from my experience that the Indian Muslims are not so innocent as they might appear....a large majority of them are simply biding their time and waiting for an opportunity to play the fifth columnists when Pakistan invades India.
('98', 287, 1, 10, 601311) 5. In view of the foregoing, I feel that your fast was not meant to achieve anything more than making the Hindus restrain their passions.
('98', 287, 1, 11, 601449) 6. I hold that the Hindu Muslim trouble can be resolved only in two ways.
('98', 287, 1, 12, 601523) First, by the Hindus completely cleansing their hearts.
('98', 287, 1, 13, 601579) That expectation may be said to have been belied long ago.
('98', 287, 1, 14, 601638) As you have observed, the Congress struggle has so far been based on the passive resistance of the weak.
('98', 287, 1, 15, 601743) Therefore, now that power has come to it, it will rush towards himsa with redoubled speed.
('98', 287, 1, 16, 601834) .The other way is for the Indian Government to handle the situation with firmness.
('98', 287, 1, 17, 601917) This, it seems to me, it has failed to do so far and to that extent— thanks to your influence—the interest of the country has suffered.
('98', 287, 1, 18, 602053) The foregoing letter deserves careful attention.
('98', 287, 1, 19, 602102) Contrary to what the correspondent holds, instances can be adduced of instantaneous change of heart.
('98', 287, 1, 20, 602203) It would have been more apt to say that such heart change is transitory.
('98', 287, 1, 21, 602276) Now that my fast is over, it remains to be seen what result it produces.
('98', 287, 1, 22, 602349) I say this not to deprecate or detract from what the writer of the foregoing letter has said.
('98', 287, 1, 23, 602443) Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs—all may learn something from it.
('98', 287, 1, 24, 602499) The ideal of communal unity is not a new one.
('98', 287, 1, 25, 602545) It has always been before the country as one of the pillars of national independence.
('98', 287, 1, 26, 602631) Without it independence cannot last.
('98', 287, 1, 27, 602668) This has been regarded as more or less axiomatic.
('98', 287, 1, 28, 602718) the transition period, which I hope is now over, reflected our distemper.
('98', 287, 1, 29, 602792) We may, therefore, expect that the unity that has been established in Delhi will prove enduring.
('98', 288, 0, 1, 602889) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 289
('98', 288, 1, 2, 602936) That the edifice of unity can rest on constructive work alone is a maxim which everybody should remember.
('98', 288, 1, 3, 603042) The question is how to realize it.
('98', 288, 1, 4, 603077) It is up to every worker who believes in it to live it in his life and to bring it home to his neighbours.
('98', 288, 1, 5, 603184) By explaining the scientific basis of the constructive programme, it can be made interesting.
('98', 288, 1, 6, 603278) Our daily experience shows that this programme cannot be advanced by mechanical or unintelligent work.
('98', 288, 1, 7, 603381) That tractors and chemical fertilizers will spell our ruin, I have not a shadow of a doubt.
('98', 288, 1, 8, 603473) I do not regard all the Muslims of India to be innocent.
('98', 288, 1, 9, 603530) What is obvious is that after the birth of Pakistan the Muslims in the Indian Union have been placed in a very difficult situation and it is up to the majority community to mete out exact justice to them.
('98', 288, 1, 10, 603735) It would spell the ruin of both the Hindu religion and the majority community if the latter, in the intoxication of power, entertains the belief that it can crush the minority community and establish a purely Hindu Raj.
('98', 288, 1, 11, 603955) I consider the present occasion to be particularly auspicious for purging out the dross from the hearts of both the communities by a strenuous effort at self purification.
('98', 288, 1, 12, 604127) The meaning of the fifth paragraph is not quite clear.
('98', 288, 1, 13, 604182) In any case, my fast being for the purification of all, I expected and still expect all—be they Hindu, Muslim or others—to turn the searchlight inward and to cast out all hidden impurity.
('98', 288, 1, 14, 604370) In the sixth paragraph I find only dry logic.
('98', 288, 1, 15, 604416) It ignores the heart.
('98', 288, 1, 16, 604438) No one has a right to say that what could not be achieved during the struggle for independence is unachievable at all times.
('98', 288, 1, 17, 604563) On the contrary, today there is a real opportunity to demonstrate the supremacy of ahimsa.
('98', 288, 1, 18, 604654) True, our people have been sucked into the whirlpool of universal militarization.
('98', 288, 1, 19, 604736) If even a few can keep out of it, it will be their privilege to set an example of ahimsa of the brave and be reckoned as the first servants of India.
('98', 288, 1, 20, 604886) This cannot be demonstrated by intellect.
('98', 288, 1, 21, 604928) Therefore, till it can be realized through experience, it must be accepted on faith.
('98', 288, 1, 22, 605013) The Swaraj Government is bound to proceed with firmness and courage.
('98', 288, 1, 23, 605082) A government which is weak or which allows itself to be led into courses which its reason does not approve of, is not fit to rule.
('98', 288, 1, 24, 605213) It ought to step aside and make way for a better one.
('98', 288, 1, 25, 605267) To say or to believe that Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel have weakened under my influence is to betray gross ignorance of their character.

('98', 289, 4, 7, 605771) m., January 23, 1948
('98', 289, 5, 8, 605792) MANUDI, I have been looking into your diary for quite a few days.
('98', 289, 5, 9, 605858) I am very pleased.
('98', 289, 5, 10, 605877) You have passed the test.
('98', 289, 5, 11, 605903) You have shown great devotion in serving me.
('98', 289, 5, 12, 605948) Whether in the family or outside I have not met a girl of your purity.
('98', 289, 5, 13, 606019) That is why I became a mother to no one but you.
('98', 289, 5, 14, 606068) Why is it that though your diary shows your mental anguish you have not expressed it to me?
('98', 289, 5, 15, 606160) Why should you be concerned about .
('98', 289, 5, 16, 606196) 1 or anyone else?
('98', 289, 5, 17, 606214) That girl has been deceiving me but in reality those who seek to deceive me are themselves deceived.
('98', 289, 5, 18, 606315) The service you have rendered in this great yajna is of inestimable value to me.
('98', 289, 5, 19, 606396) Your only offence is that you have let your body be ruined in the process, not so much from physical work as from your native reticence.
('98', 289, 5, 20, 606533) Who knows but that there may be another bomb explosion and with Ramanama on my lips I may be taken away from you?
('98', 289, 5, 21, 606647) If that happens you will have won a total victory, only I shall not be there to watch it.
('98', 289, 5, 22, 606737) But these scribbled words will remain and so will you.
('98', 289, 5, 23, 606792) As for me, I shall think I have won a victory only when you transform yourself from an old woman of seventy which you look like today, into a blooming maiden of seventeen.
('98', 289, 5, 24, 606964) You see how God is helping us.
('98', 289, 5, 25, 606995) Everyone is appearing in his true colours.
('98', 289, 5, 26, 607038) In the Congress too there is so much confusion.
('98', 289, 5, 27, 607086) Today I have written you a long letter.
('98', 289, 5, 28, 607126) Please send a copy to Jaisukhlal.
('98', 289, 5, 29, 607160) May your service bear fruit.

('98', 290, 2, 3, 607467) January 23, 1948
('98', 290, 3, 4, 607484) The latest is to the effect that about 500 people have died of illness brought about by exposure and partial starvation and 1,100 were lying ill....
('98', 290, 3, 5, 607633) 2 I have decided, therefore, to send to your State Mr. Leslie Cross of the Friends’ Service Unit to be assisted by Dr. Sushila Nayyar ...
('98', 290, 3, 6, 607771) 3 who, when she was yet a child ...
('98', 290, 3, 7, 607807) 4 came under my care and has been with me ever since and is now, among other things, serving Muslim evacuees....
('98', 290, 3, 8, 607920) 5 They are going to your State in the hope of meeting you and meeting such non Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs, whom they may be permitted to see and bring me first hand information.
('98', 290, 4, 9, 608097) Nothing would please me better than to be able to testify personally that things are as happy as they are described in your letter under reply and that I can advise the refugees from your State to return with perfect confidence as to the safety of their lives, honour and faith.
('98', 290, 4, 10, 608376) I am not inclined to favour the view suggested by you that all these people left under a plot to discredit the State.
('98', 290, 4, 11, 608494) If you are not confident that these unhappy refugees can return to their homes and resume their former avocations, I know you will not hesitate to say so and in that case I would suggest your sending away, at least for the present, all your Hindu and Sikh subjects including Harijans, to the Union under proper escort.
('98', 290, 4, 12, 608813) The chief question to consider is whether the Muslims of the State and the Muslim refugees have come under the purificatory influence of the recent fast, so as to welcome back their Hindu and Sikh brothers and sisters.

('98', 291, 4, 4, 609379) Your letter is beautiful.
('98', 291, 4, 5, 609405) I am sending it for publication in Harijan 1 omitting the name and other particulars.

('98', 291, 4, 8, 609588) Ask me if you do not follow it.

('98', 291, 4, 11, 609741) It requires ceaseless practice, which I have not been able to manage.

('98', 291, 9, 20, 610156) My giving up the fast has not lessened my responsibility; it has added to it.
('98', 291, 9, 21, 610234) I am slowly regaining strength.
('98', 291, 9, 22, 610266) It will count for something if I can show some achievement in Delhi.
('98', 291, 9, 23, 610335) On the 20th I might have died.
('98', 291, 9, 24, 610366) But Rama saved me because He had to take some more work from me.
('98', 291, 9, 25, 610431) But if I can die with a smile on my lips it will be a great mercy.
('98', 291, 9, 26, 610498) Do I deserve such grace?
('98', 291, 9, 27, 610523) It is my endeavour to make myself fit for such death.
('98', 291, 9, 28, 610577) The endeavour becomes more earnest with each passing day.
('98', 291, 9, 29, 610635) This morning I had a long frank talk with Manu.
('98', 291, 9, 30, 610683) I am a servant of Rama.
('98', 291, 9, 31, 610707) I shall work as long as He commands me to work; I shall go when He commands me to go.
('98', 291, 9, 32, 610793) I am prepared for both.

('98', 292, 5, 7, 611187) NEW DELHI , January 23, 1948
('98', 292, 6, 8, 611216) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, I have many things to say today.
('98', 292, 6, 9, 611271) I shall try to deal with as many as I can.
('98', 292, 6, 10, 611314) Today is Subhas Babu’s birthday.
('98', 292, 6, 11, 611347) I have told you I cannot remember anyone’s Birthday or death anniversary.
('98', 292, 6, 12, 611421) Someone reminded me of Subhas Babu’s birthday.
('98', 292, 6, 13, 611468) Subhas Babu was a votary of violence while I am a devotee of ahimsa.
('98', 292, 6, 14, 611537) But what does it matter?
('98', 292, 6, 15, 611562) I know that the most important thing is that we should learn from other people’s virtues.
('98', 292, 6, 16, 611652) As Tulsidas says:
('98', 292, 7, 17, 611670) The Lord has created this world full of lifeless and living things and virtues and vices.
('98', 292, 7, 18, 611760) The wise like the swan take the milk of virtue and leave out the waste of water.
('98', 292, 7, 19, 611841) We should be like the swan and take the milk of virtue.
('98', 292, 7, 20, 611897) Man has virtues as well as vices.
('98', 292, 7, 21, 611931) We should emulate him in his virtues and forget his deficiencies.
('98', 292, 7, 22, 611997) Subhas was a great patriot.
('98', 292, 7, 23, 612025) He laid down his life for the country.
('98', 292, 7, 24, 612064) He was not by nature a fighter but he became commander of an army and took up arms against a great empire.
('98', 292, 7, 25, 612171) The soldiers of that army included Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and Christians.
('98', 292, 7, 26, 612246) He never considered himself only a Bengali.
('98', 292, 7, 27, 612290) He had no use for parochialism or caste distinctions.
('98', 292, 7, 28, 612344) In his eyes all were Indians and servants of India.
('98', 292, 7, 29, 612396) He treated all alike.
('98', 292, 7, 30, 612418) It never occurred to him that since he was the commander he deserved more and others less.
('98', 292, 7, 31, 612509) Let us therefore in remembering Subhas think of his great virtues and purge our hearts of malice.
('98', 292, 7, 32, 612607) Once a friend who was an eminent advocate asked me to define Hinduism.
('98', 292, 7, 33, 612678) I told him I was neither a lawyer like him nor a religious leader and was really unable to define Hinduism, but I would suggest that a Hindu was one who had equal respect for all religions.
('98', 293, 0, 1, 612868) 294 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 293, 1, 2, 612910) had equal respect for all religions and he easily won every heart.
('98', 293, 1, 3, 612977) It is good to remember such things on this occasion.
('98', 293, 1, 4, 613030) I told you some time ago of the tragic happenings in a village of Gwalior in which some Muslims were killed.
('98', 293, 1, 5, 613139) 1 I have been making inquiries and I have a letter in this regard.
('98', 293, 1, 6, 613206) The correspondent has given his name.
('98', 293, 1, 7, 613244) He says I was wrong in saying that the place where murder, arson and looting are said to have occurred was Ratlam.
('98', 293, 1, 8, 613359) It was really Jahangirpur which is in Gwalior State.
('98', 293, 1, 9, 613412) He says that the report was not quite accurate.
('98', 293, 1, 10, 613460) No doubt there was some disturbance but it was a private quarrel involving some Hindus and some Muslims.
('98', 293, 1, 11, 613565) He says that it was not right to give the incident a communal colour and that no one was killed.
('98', 293, 1, 12, 613662) I must place before you whatever reaches me.
('98', 293, 1, 13, 613707) If people fabricate stories in this way, it must lead to widespread mis understanding.
('98', 293, 1, 14, 613794) If you must exaggerate, you should exaggerate your own shortcomings.
('98', 293, 1, 15, 613863) Only then can it be said that we are following the path of self purification.
('98', 293, 1, 16, 613941) I have a telegram from Mysore, saying that although what I have achieved in Delhi is quite creditable, one cannot say that it has had any effect in Mysore for there has been rioting there.
('98', 293, 1, 17, 614130) There is also news to this effect in the newspapers.
('98', 293, 1, 18, 614183) I know the Hindus and Muslims of Mysore.
('98', 293, 1, 19, 614224) I have stayed there many times.
('98', 293, 1, 20, 614256) I also know the people running the Government there and I have asked them to explain to the world everything that has happened.
('98', 293, 1, 21, 614384) There is no doubt that some tragic events have taken place in Mysore.
('98', 293, 1, 22, 614454) I also have a telegram from some Muslims in Junagadh.
('98', 293, 1, 23, 614508) It is a lengthy one but it is good.
('98', 293, 1, 24, 614544) They say that ever since the Sardar took over the administration of Junagadh and a Regional Commissioner was appointed, they have been treated with justice and fairness.
('98', 293, 1, 25, 614714) They assure me that no one can create a rift between Hindus and Muslims there.
('98', 293, 1, 26, 614793) A referendum is soon to take place in Junagadh 2 and when that happens Muslims will vote for the continuation of the present arrangement.
('98', 293, 1, 27, 614931) There is also a wire from Meerut from the local Hindus.
('98', 293, 1, 28, 614987) They say that the fast has created a very good effect.
('98', 293, 1, 29, 615042) They have no malice against the nationalist Muslims but if I think that the Muslim Leaguers

('98', 294, 1, 2, 615384) have become good or will ever become good, I shall have to repent.
('98', 294, 1, 3, 615451) They praise my ahimsa but say that it cannot be effective in politics, that it should be confined only to spiritual matters.
('98', 294, 1, 4, 615576) Then they express their approval of the present Government consisting of Panditji, the Sardar and others and say that it should not be changed.
('98', 294, 1, 5, 615720) I have not so far heard anything suggesting that a change is impending.
('98', 294, 1, 6, 615792) I cannot imagine who can change them or dismiss them.
('98', 294, 1, 7, 615846) But still people talk and exaggerate.
('98', 294, 1, 8, 615884) The Meerut Hindus have participated fully in the struggle for freedom.
('98', 294, 1, 9, 615955) But they are in error in what they say.
('98', 294, 1, 10, 615995) In politics we cannot say that we shall trust some people and not trust others.
('98', 294, 1, 11, 616075) The people who are in the Government today have got to be trusted.
('98', 294, 1, 12, 616142) We shall also have to trust the Muslims.
('98', 294, 1, 13, 616183) If we have decided to live as brothers with Muslims we cannot distrust any Muslim even if he is a Muslim Leaguer.
('98', 294, 1, 14, 616297) Similarly, if Muslims say that all Hindus and Sikhs are wicked it will be nonsense.
('98', 294, 1, 15, 616381) All that we can do is to bring it to the notice of the Government that such and such a person is bad and then it will be for the Government to punish him in any way.
('98', 294, 1, 16, 616547) We must not take the law into our own hands.
('98', 294, 1, 17, 616592) It will be barbarism.
('98', 294, 1, 18, 616614) I continue to receive numerous wires.
('98', 294, 1, 19, 616652) I cannot answer all the senders individually.
('98', 294, 1, 20, 616698) I thank all of them through this meeting.
('98', 294, 1, 21, 616740) May their blessings bear fruit.

('98', 294, 5, 26, 616875) Great Britain prides itself on possessing the “Mother of Parliaments”.
('98', 294, 5, 27, 616946) The method prevailing there is to maintain at Government cost “His Majesty’s Opposition” to keep the Ministers within bounds by directing the flood light of public criticism on the steps taken or proposed to be taken by the Government....
('98', 294, 5, 28, 617185) Our country has taken up the reins of government.
('98', 294, 5, 29, 617235) If we desire to pursue non violence, what shall be the form of our government?
('98', 294, 5, 30, 617314) Our Government also will need a corrective force to perform the functions of an “Opposition”....
('98', 294, 5, 31, 617411) What we should aim at is not to replace the ministers, but to hold up models that they should follow.
('98', 294, 5, 32, 617513) The constructive workers should direct them into proper channels by the beaconlight of their example.
('98', 294, 5, 33, 617615) This is a great responsibility that would devolve upon the constructive workers in a
('98', 295, 0, 1, 617700) 296 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 295, 1, 2, 617742) non violent economy.
('98', 295, 1, 3, 617763) A well organized body of constructive workers will be needed to provide this directive force.
('98', 295, 1, 4, 617857) Their service to the people will be their sanction and the merit of their work will be their charter.
('98', 295, 1, 5, 617959) The ministers will draw their inspiration from such a body which will advise and guide the secular government.
('98', 295, 1, 6, 618070) To be able to discharge this function the constructive workers forming such a body will have to be drawn from men of renunciation, whose one aim and ambition is the service of the people.
('98', 295, 1, 7, 618258) In a political structure of this nature the body of constructive workers will form the bulwark of safety for the people against exploitation.
('98', 295, 1, 8, 618400) A government run on this basis will give the needed emphasis to the affairs of the people and ensure their welfare, bringing in swaraj to the masses.
('98', 295, 1, 9, 618550) This is very attractive.
('98', 295, 1, 10, 618575) 1 But it has to be confessed that we have not the requisite number of selfless workers capable of giving a good account of themselves.

('98', 295, 6, 15, 618806) JAISUKHLAL,
('98', 295, 7, 16, 618818) I am writing to you after a long time.
('98', 295, 7, 17, 618857) But Manu does write to you and you write to her, so both you and I have news of each other.
('98', 295, 7, 18, 618949) One may say that something has been achieved in Delhi.
('98', 295, 7, 19, 619004) How long it is going to last remains to be seen.
('98', 295, 7, 20, 619053) The weakness following the fast persists.
('98', 295, 7, 21, 619095) But God is slowly giving me back my strength.
('98', 295, 7, 22, 619141) The kidneys and the liver are not functioning as satisfactorily as they should.
('98', 295, 7, 23, 619221) I write this about Manu, whom a year ago you offered as a sacrifice in this great yajna.
('98', 295, 7, 24, 619310) It will not be wrong to say that occasionally I have been harsh in testing her.
('98', 295, 7, 25, 619390) But the more brutal my treatment the more it was a blessing to her.
('98', 295, 7, 26, 619458) She unflinchingly went through the ordeal and satisfactorily came out unscathed.
('98', 295, 7, 27, 619539) As I had

('98', 296, 1, 2, 619664) said at Srirampore, in this yajna we have to do or die.
('98', 296, 1, 3, 619720) Here both these will be encompassed.
('98', 296, 1, 4, 619757) On the 20th when the bomb exploded Manu was sitting beside me along with others.
('98', 296, 1, 5, 619838) So we might both have died.
('98', 296, 1, 6, 619866) But who can harm one whom Rama protects!
('98', 296, 1, 7, 619907) Yesterday I had a long talk with Manu.
('98', 296, 1, 8, 619946) I told her to write to you that if you could free yourself from there, you should come to Sevagram or Delhi.
('98', 296, 1, 9, 620055) It is possible that I may have to go to Wardha for Jamnalal’s death anniversary 1. But it is not certain.
('98', 296, 1, 10, 620161) It does not seem likely that I can get away from Delhi.
('98', 296, 1, 11, 620217) Manu told me that since it was I who had laid down terms for participation in this yajna I myself should write to you.
('98', 296, 1, 12, 620336) The best thing would be for you to see my programme in the newspapers and then come wherever I may be.
('98', 296, 1, 13, 620439) You will see that I have settled the debt I owed.
('98', 296, 1, 14, 620489) She has sent you her diaries.
('98', 296, 1, 15, 620519) She has made great progress in writing the diary.
('98', 296, 1, 16, 620569) She takes great interest in writing notes and when I see them Mahadev’s face appears before my eyes.
('98', 296, 1, 17, 620670) I am dictating this immediately after the prayer.
('98', 296, 1, 18, 620720) There is a heap of letters to be attended to.
('98', 296, 1, 19, 620766) If God wills we shall be meeting in a few days and when we can talk about the rest.
('98', 296, 1, 20, 620850) Manu is enjoying herself.
('98', 296, 1, 21, 620876) If you have some magic for making her fat you should let me know.
('98', 296, 1, 22, 620942) The girls will be well with their in laws.

('98', 296, 6, 27, 621091) Things are well here but elsewhere there is certainly disorder.
('98', 296, 6, 28, 621155) In Sind and the N. W. F. P. the situation is deteriorating.
('98', 296, 6, 29, 621215) I have sent Jehangir Patel and Dinshaw Mehta to have talks with Jinnah, Liaquat Ali and others.
('98', 296, 6, 30, 621311) I am hoping that I shall get considerable help from Suhrawardy in my projected visit to Pakistan.
('98', 296, 6, 31, 621409) But all this is day dreaming.
('98', 296, 6, 32, 621439) By God’s grace I am slowly regaining strength.

('98', 297, 1, 2, 621571) of Rama.
('98', 297, 1, 3, 621580) I will do His work so long as He wills.
('98', 297, 1, 4, 621620) I shall have won if I am granted a death whereby I can demonstrate the strength of truth and non violence.
('98', 297, 1, 5, 621727) I did not display any courage in what happened on the 20th.
('98', 297, 1, 6, 621787) I thought it was part of some army exercise.
('98', 297, 1, 7, 621832) Had I known that it was an intimation of my death I cannot tell how I might have reacted.
('98', 297, 1, 8, 621922) So I am not yet a mahatma.
('98', 297, 1, 9, 621949) What does it matter if people describe me as one?
('98', 297, 1, 10, 621999) I am only an ordinary mortal.
('98', 297, 1, 11, 622029) Yes, if I have been sincere in my pursuit of truth, non violence, nonstealing, brahmacharya and so on and if I have done all this with God as my witness, I shall certainly be granted the kind of death that I seek.
('98', 297, 1, 12, 622243) I have expressed the wish at the prayer meeting 1 also that should someone kill me I may have no anger against the killer in my heart and I may die with Ramanama on my lips.
('98', 297, 1, 13, 622417) Today after the prayer I wrote a letter to Manu’s father.
('98', 297, 1, 14, 622475) This is the next.
('98', 297, 1, 15, 622493) There is a whole pile of letters to answer.
('98', 297, 1, 16, 622537) The Working Committee will also start meeting from today.
('98', 297, 1, 17, 622595) Therefore the post can be attended to only after the morning prayer.
('98', 297, 1, 18, 622664) You should keep me informed of things there.
('98', 297, 1, 19, 622709) Nothing has been decided about my going to Sevagram.

('98', 297, 5, 23, 622831) NEW DELHI , January 24, 1948
('98', 297, 6, 24, 622860) BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
('98', 297, 7, 25, 622882) I requested you to maintain silence during the prayer meeting.
('98', 297, 7, 26, 622945) For some time you were quiet, but later when the prayer was going on some women carried on a conversation and children were screaming.
('98', 297, 7, 27, 623080) I have repeatedly said that when children cry they should be taken out of the meeting.
('98', 297, 7, 28, 623167) Good manners demand that women should not keep their crying children in the meeting.
('98', 297, 7, 29, 623252) Today I will deal with a lengthy telegram, which I had no time to take up yesterday.
('98', 297, 7, 30, 623337) It says that the agreement that had been signed
('98', 297, 8, 31, 623385) 1 On January 21; vide “Speech at Prayer Meeting”, 21 1 1948.
('98', 298, 0, 1, 623446) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 299
('98', 298, 1, 2, 623493) between the two Governments for expatriation of the prisoners and abducted girls was a good one but that it only lasted for a short while and has now been broken.
('98', 298, 1, 3, 623656) The reason for this seems to have been the condition laid down by the West Punjab Government that it would implement the agreement only after all the States in East Punjab had undertaken to return all the Muslim girls held anywhere under their jurisdiction.
('98', 298, 1, 4, 623914) I can see no difficulty in this if the same should apply to the States in West Punjab even if there are fewer States there than in East Punjab.
('98', 298, 1, 5, 624058) It is true that difficulties crop up in implementing such an agreement.
('98', 298, 1, 6, 624130) When the agreement was signed no difficulties were raised.
('98', 298, 1, 7, 624189) What does it matter?
('98', 298, 1, 8, 624210) All the girls whether on this side or that side should be restored.
('98', 298, 1, 9, 624278) It does not seem to me to be right that if ten girls are returned by the West Punjab Government East Punjab should also return only that number and no more.
('98', 298, 1, 10, 624435) All the girls held in East Punjab, all the women and men who are prisoners should be returned unconditionally.
('98', 298, 1, 11, 624546) But today this does not happen because there is ill feeling.
('98', 298, 1, 12, 624607) What does it matter that there are more girls held in West Punjab than in East Punjab?
('98', 298, 1, 13, 624694) I say that we should not think on these lines.
('98', 298, 1, 14, 624741) It is all a mistake.
('98', 298, 1, 15, 624762) To carry away one person is as much a mistake as to carry away a hundred.
('98', 298, 1, 16, 624836) If more were not carried away it is only because the ruffians were not able to—not because they did not intend to—carry away so many girls or imprison so many men.
('98', 298, 1, 17, 625000) A process that has been once set in motion should not be hampered.
('98', 298, 1, 18, 625067) In fact the agreement should have been extended to cover other things too.
('98', 298, 1, 19, 625142) If the two Governments meet in a spirit of amity and fully resolve that they will not go to war, the way will become clear.
('98', 298, 1, 20, 625266) I shall therefore humbly ask the two Governments to forget what has happened and to correct themselves.
('98', 298, 1, 21, 625370) We must cleanse our hearts.
('98', 298, 1, 22, 625398) But even if our hearts have not been cleansed we can still do what is clearly our duty.
('98', 298, 1, 23, 625486) Self purification means that we purge our hearts.
('98', 298, 1, 24, 625536) I have been receiving complaints that not all the girls abducted are returned from West Punjab.
('98', 298, 1, 25, 625632) I have the same complaint concerning girls held in East Punjab.
('98', 298, 1, 26, 625696) I have not conducted any investigation and cannot say who is lying and who is telling the truth.
('98', 298, 1, 27, 625793) But if the complaint is true with regard to West Punjab it is a matter of shame.
('98', 298, 1, 28, 625874) The same holds good for East Punjab.
('98', 298, 1, 29, 625911) But there is yet another complaint against West Punjab.
('98', 298, 1, 30, 625967) It is said they say one thing and do the opposite of it.
('98', 298, 1, 31, 626024) All I can say is that this should be put right or else

('98', 299, 5, 7, 626300) BIRLA HOUSE, NEW DELHI , January 25, 1948
('98', 299, 6, 8, 626342) DAUGHTER AMTUL SALAAM, I have your two letters.
('98', 299, 6, 9, 626390) It is as you say.
('98', 299, 6, 10, 626408) God is very merciful.
('98', 299, 6, 11, 626430) Of all my fasts this was the biggest.
('98', 299, 6, 12, 626468) What the result will be God alone knows.
('98', 299, 6, 13, 626509) I am dictating this letter, because after prayer in the morning it is more convenient to dictate than to write.
('98', 299, 6, 14, 626621) I am in a dilemma about your coming here.
('98', 299, 6, 15, 626663) At first I had thought of sending you a telegram, then I gave up the idea.
('98', 299, 6, 16, 626738) If the work at Borkamta can go on well in your absence and you can be conveniently relieved from there, you can come to me.
('98', 299, 6, 17, 626862) I am regaining strength.
('98', 299, 6, 18, 626887) Do not worry about me.
('98', 299, 6, 19, 626910) About Kanu too I am in a dilemma.
('98', 299, 6, 20, 626944) He can come if he wants to.
('98', 299, 6, 21, 626972) If I get the time I will write to him.
('98', 299, 6, 22, 627011) I am sending Rashid’s wife’s 2 letter to you.
('98', 299, 6, 23, 627057) I could not decipher her signature.
('98', 299, 6, 24, 627093) What is her name?
('98', 299, 6, 25, 627111) I wrote to her that she could come whenever she wanted.
('98', 299, 6, 26, 627167) She will stay with me.

('98', 299, 9, 29, 627251) 1 At this stage the chatter had become so loud that Gandhiji said he could not proceed with what he wanted to say and brought the meeting to a close.
('98', 299, 9, 30, 627401) He stressed the importance of the women observing complete silence at the prayers and suggested that those with children should stand at the fringe so as not to disturb the meeting.

('98', 300, 3, 4, 627723) PRABHUDAYAL, I have your letter.
('98', 300, 3, 5, 627756) You are doing good work.
('98', 300, 3, 6, 627781) Keep working in the same way.
('98', 300, 3, 7, 627811) We have never done any work in the villages and therefore the difficulties arise.
('98', 300, 3, 8, 627893) You have to produce there milk, fruit and vegetables.
('98', 300, 3, 9, 627947) Leafy vegetables take very little time to grow.
('98', 300, 3, 10, 627995) Do you not have any cow at all in your village?
('98', 300, 3, 11, 628043) Meet the zamindars and try to soften their hearts with love.
('98', 300, 3, 12, 628104) So far we have not seen the true strength of ahimsa.

('98', 300, 7, 17, 628267) NEW DELHI , January 25, 1948
('98', 300, 8, 18, 628296) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, People say that we have achieved heart unity.
('98', 300, 8, 19, 628364) I question both Muslims and Hindus and they all say that they have realized the futility of going on fighting with each other.
('98', 300, 8, 20, 628491) I will not ask how many Muslims there are at this meeting.
('98', 300, 8, 21, 628550) But I shall ask everyone to treat them as their brothers.
('98', 300, 8, 22, 628608) If you meet any Muslim treat him as a brother and offer him a place to sit.
('98', 300, 8, 23, 628684) For the last two days more people have been coming to the prayer.
('98', 300, 8, 24, 628750) If each one of them brings a Muslim with him it will be a great thing.
('98', 300, 8, 25, 628821) The Urs 1 will start from tomorrow at the Mehrauli shrine.
('98', 300, 8, 26, 628880) This fair is an annual feature but this year we had destroyed the shrine.
('98', 300, 8, 27, 628954) Even the stone lattice work was demolished.
('98', 300, 8, 28, 628998) Now it has been repaired somewhat and the Urs will take place as usual.
('98', 300, 8, 29, 629070) I do not know how many Muslims will go there but I know that formerly a large number of them visited the Urs and so did a large number of Hindus.
('98', 300, 9, 30, 629216) 1 A religious fair held annually at the shrine of Khwaja Syed Kutub ud Din Bakhtiar

('98', 301, 1, 2, 629342) that this time too Hindus will go there with peaceful intent and reverent hearts.
('98', 301, 1, 3, 629424) Let them not mock or malign the Muslims who will be going to the fair.
('98', 301, 1, 4, 629495) The police of course will be there but these should be as few as possible, you should all act as policemen yourselves and make sure that everything functions smoothly.
('98', 301, 1, 5, 629663) At any rate you have earned a good name.
('98', 301, 1, 6, 629704) The newspapers feature it and I continue to receive letters and telegrams from all over the world.
('98', 301, 1, 7, 629803) I am receiving communications from China and other parts of Asia and from America and Europe as well.
('98', 301, 1, 8, 629905) All of them say that we have achieved here something very great, that they had been fearing that with the British having left the country we Indians being stupid and inexperienced in the ways of governing would destroy ourselves in a civil war.
('98', 301, 1, 9, 630150) I shall be leaving for Wardha on February 2. Rajendra Babu will accompany me.
('98', 301, 1, 10, 630228) But I shall try to return to Delhi as soon as I can.
('98', 301, 1, 11, 630281) The newspaper report that I shall be staying there for a month is not correct.
('98', 301, 1, 12, 630360) I shall go to Wardha only if you will all bless me and assure me that you will not start fighting as soon as I leave.
('98', 301, 1, 13, 630478) I shall later go to Pakistan also, but for that to be possible the Pakistan Government has to tell me that I can go and carry on my work there.
('98', 301, 1, 14, 630622) Even if any one of the Provincial Governments of Pakistan invites me I shall go.
('98', 301, 1, 15, 630703) Whenever there is a meeting of the Congress Working Committee at which I am present I give you some idea of what is transacted there.
('98', 301, 1, 16, 630837) Today there was a second meeting of the Congress Working Committee and many matters were discussed there.
('98', 301, 1, 17, 630943) You may not be interested in everything that was taken up for discussion but one thing I may tell you.
('98', 301, 1, 18, 631046) The Congress had decided some twenty years ago that there should be as many provinces in the country as there are major languages.
('98', 301, 1, 19, 631177) The Congress had also said that as soon as power came into its hands such linguistic provinces would be formed.
('98', 301, 1, 20, 631289) For that matter we have nine or ten provinces even today—all under a central authority.
('98', 301, 1, 21, 631377) If new provinces are formed and they are all placed under the authority of Delhi there is no harm in it.
('98', 301, 1, 22, 631482) But it will be very bad if they all want to be free and refuse to accept central authority.
('98', 301, 1, 23, 631574) It should not be that Bombay then will have nothing to do with Maharashtra and Maharashtra with Karnataka and Karnataka with Andhra.
('98', 301, 1, 24, 631707) Let all live as brothers.
('98', 301, 1, 25, 631733) Moreover if linguistic provinces are formed it will also give a fillip to the regional languages.
('98', 301, 1, 26, 631831) It would be absurd to make Hindustani the medium of instruction in all the regions and it is still more absurd to use English for this purpose.

('98', 302, 1, 2, 632063) 301. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING1
('98', 302, 2, 3, 632094) NEW DELHI , January 26, 1948
('98', 302, 3, 4, 632123) This day, 26th January, is Independence Day.
('98', 302, 3, 5, 632168) This observance was quite appropriate when we were fighting for independence we had not seen nor handled.
('98', 302, 3, 6, 632274) Now we have handled it and we seem to be disillusioned.
('98', 302, 3, 7, 632330) At least I am, even if you are not.
('98', 302, 3, 8, 632366) What are we celebrating today?
('98', 302, 3, 9, 632397) Surely not our disillusionment.
('98', 302, 3, 10, 632429) We are entitled to celebrate the hope that the worst is over and that we are on the road to showing the lowliest of the villager that it means his freedom from serfdom and that he is no longer a serf born to serve the cities and towns of India but that he is destined to exploit the city dwellers for the advertisement of the finished fruits of well thought out labours, that he is the salt of the Indian earth and that it means also equality of all classes and creeds, never the domination and superiority of the major community over a minor, however insignificant it may be in numbers or influence.
('98', 302, 3, 11, 633030) Let us not defer the hope and make the heart sick.
('98', 302, 3, 12, 633081) Yet, what are the strikes and a variety of lawlessnesses but a deferring of the hope?
('98', 302, 3, 13, 633167) These are symptoms of our sickness and weakness.
('98', 302, 3, 14, 633216) Let labour realize its dignity and strength.
('98', 302, 3, 15, 633261) Capital has neither dignity nor strength compared to labour.
('98', 302, 3, 16, 633322) These the man in the street also has.
('98', 302, 3, 17, 633360) In a well ordered democratic society there is no room, no occasion, for lawlessness or strikes.
('98', 302, 3, 18, 633456) In such a society there are ample lawful means for vindicating justice.
('98', 302, 3, 19, 633528) Violence veiled or unveiled must be taboo.
('98', 302, 3, 20, 633571) Strikes in Kanpur, coal mines or elsewhere mean material loss to the whole society not excluding the strikers themselves.
('98', 302, 3, 21, 633693) I need not be reminded that this declamation does not lie well in the mouth of one like me who has been responsible for so many successful strikes.
('98', 302, 3, 22, 633841) If there be such critics they ought not to forget that then there was neither independence nor the kind of legislation we now have.
('98', 302, 3, 23, 633973) I wonder if we can remain free from the fever of power politics or the bid for power which afflicts the political world, the East and the West.
('98', 302, 3, 24, 634117) Before leaving this topic of the day, let us permit ourselves to hope that though geographically and politically India is divided into two, at heart we shall ever be friends and brothers helping and respecting one another and be one for the outside world.
('98', 302, 4, 25, 634373) 1 It being Gandhiji’s silence day, Pyarelal translated the written speech into Hindustani and read it out after the prayers.
('98', 303, 0, 1, 634498) 304 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 303, 1, 2, 634540) Decontrol of cloth 1 has been welcomed in all quarters.
('98', 303, 1, 3, 634596) There never was a scarcity of cloth.
('98', 303, 1, 4, 634633) How can it be when there is enough cotton and enough hands in the land for spinning and weaving?
('98', 303, 1, 5, 634730) Equally welcome is the removal of control on firewood and coal.
('98', 303, 1, 6, 634794) It is remarkable that there is now a glut in the market of gur, the poor man’s supply for caloric deficiency.
('98', 303, 1, 7, 634904) There would be no remedy for glut nor for reaching places outside the boundary of production unless there is quick locomotion.
('98', 303, 1, 8, 635031) Let a correspondent in the know speak on this subject:
('98', 303, 2, 9, 635086) Needless to say that efficiency of the rail and road transport is the chief factor for the success of the decontrol policy.
('98', 303, 2, 10, 635210) If there is no improvement in the railway transport there is a danger of countrywide famine and the entire collapse of the decontrols.
('98', 303, 2, 11, 635345) The present working of the railway transport is a living danger to these decontrols and controls alike.
('98', 303, 2, 12, 635449) The terrible contrast of different prices prevalent in different parts of India for the same commodity is chiefly due to this transport bottleneck.
('98', 303, 2, 13, 635597) If gur is sold at Rs. 8 per maund at Rohtak and at Rs. 50 in Bombay, we must say there is something wrong with the working of the railways.
('98', 303, 2, 14, 635737) Thousands of wagons in the length and breadth of the country are not kept moving.
('98', 303, 2, 15, 635819) Wagons are not even unloaded for months and months together.
('98', 303, 2, 16, 635880) Corruption is rampant in a most virulent form in the booking of these wagons, in the garb of ‘scarcity of wagons and coal’ and ‘priority for different commodities’.
('98', 303, 2, 17, 636045) For the booking of one wagonload one has to spend hundreds of rupees and spend days together in the railway yards.
('98', 303, 2, 18, 636160) Even the best efforts of the worthy Transport Minister 2 have cut no ice in so far as the supply of these wagons and their constant moving is concerned.
('98', 303, 2, 19, 636313) The entire rail and road transport requires a complete overhauling by the Transport Minister to make the decontrols a thorough success.
('98', 303, 2, 20, 636449) Then only decontrols shall prove a blessing to the poor for the benefit of whom they are being pursued.
('98', 303, 2, 21, 636553) Millions of villagers, farmers and labourers are hit owing to the defective system in this rail and road transport as their produce seldom reaches the market.
('98', 303, 2, 22, 636712) As stated in my previous letter, the rationing of petrol ought to be removed and monopoly and permit system of the road transport may be abolished altogether.
('98', 303, 2, 23, 636871) This monopoly system is benefiting a few transport companies only but has rendered the lives of millions and millions of our countrymen difficult.
('98', 303, 2, 24, 637018) Ninety five per cent of the success in decontrols solely depends upon
('98', 303, 3, 25, 637088) 1 The Government had decided to decontrol cloth from January 19. 2 John Matthai

('98', 304, 1, 3, 637270) e., in keeping the wagons moving, and abolishing the rationing of petrol and the permit and monopoly system of the lorries.
('98', 304, 1, 4, 637394) This shall bring from the remotest corners of the country lakhs of tons of foodstuffs and all other produce profusely to the entire markets of the land.
('98', 304, 1, 5, 637547) The subject of corruption referred to by the correspondent is not new.
('98', 304, 1, 6, 637618) Only it has become much worse than before.
('98', 304, 1, 7, 637661) Restraint from without has practically gone.
('98', 304, 1, 8, 637706) Corruption will go when the large number of persons given to the unworthy practice realize that the nation does not exist for them but that they do for the nation.
('98', 304, 1, 9, 637870) It requires a high code of morals, extreme vigilance on the part of those who are free from the corrupt practice and who have influence over corrupt servants.
('98', 304, 1, 10, 638029) Indifference in such matters is criminal.
('98', 304, 1, 11, 638071) If our evening prayers are genuine, they must play no mean part in removing from our midst the demon of corruption.

('98', 304, 3, 13, 638241) 302. CONGRESS POSITION
('98', 304, 4, 14, 638264) Indian National Congress which is the oldest national political organization and which has after many battles fought her non violent way to freedom cannot be allowed to die.
('98', 304, 4, 15, 638438) It can only die with the nation.
('98', 304, 4, 16, 638471) A living organism ever grows or it dies.
('98', 304, 4, 17, 638512) The Congress has won political freedom, but it has yet to win economic freedom, social and moral freedom.
('98', 304, 4, 18, 638618) These freedoms are harder than the political, if only because they are constructive, less exciting and not spectacular.
('98', 304, 4, 19, 638738) All embracing constructive work evokes the energy of all the units of the millions.
('98', 304, 4, 20, 638822) The Congress has got the preliminary and necessary part of her freedom.
('98', 304, 4, 21, 638894) The hardest has yet to come.
('98', 304, 4, 22, 638923) In its difficult ascent to democracy, it has inevitably created rotten boroughs leading to corruption and creation of institutions popular and democratic only in name.
('98', 304, 4, 23, 639091) How to get out of the weedy and unwieldy growth?
('98', 304, 4, 24, 639140) The Congress must do away with its special register of members, at no time exceeding one crore, not even then easily identifiable.
('98', 304, 4, 25, 639271) It had an unknown register of millions who could never be wanted.
('98', 304, 4, 26, 639337) Its register should now be co extensive with all the men and women on the voters’ rolls in the country.
('98', 304, 4, 27, 639441) The Congress business should be to see that no faked name gets in and no legitimate name is left out.
('98', 305, 0, 1, 639543) 306 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 305, 1, 2, 639585) its own register it will have a body of servants of the nation who would be workers doing the work allotted to them from time to time.
('98', 305, 1, 3, 639720) Unfortunately for the country they will be drawn chiefly for the time being from the city dwellers, most of whom would be required to work for and in the villages of India.
('98', 305, 1, 4, 639893) The ranks must be filled in increasing numbers from the villagers.
('98', 305, 1, 5, 639960) These servants will be expected to operate upon and serve the voters registered according to law, in their own surroundings.
('98', 305, 1, 6, 640085) Many persons and parties will woo them.
('98', 305, 1, 7, 640125) The very best will win.
('98', 305, 1, 8, 640149) Thus and in no other way can the Congress regain its fast ebbing unique position in the country.
('98', 305, 1, 9, 640246) But yesterday the Congress was unwittingly the servant of the nation, it was Khudai khidmatgar—God’s servant.
('98', 305, 1, 10, 640356) Let it now proclaim to itself and the world that it is only God’s servant—nothing more, nothing less.
('98', 305, 1, 11, 640458) If it engages in the ungainly skirmish for power, it will find one fine morning that it is no more.
('98', 305, 1, 12, 640558) Thank God, it is now no longer in sole possession of the field.
('98', 305, 1, 13, 640622) I have only opened to view the distant scene.
('98', 305, 1, 14, 640668) If I have the time and health, I hope to discuss in these columns what the servants of the nation can do to raise themselves in the estimation of their masters, the whole of the adult population, male and female.

('98', 305, 6, 20, 641028) It is unsigned, with a subscription “Yours oppressed”.
('98', 305, 6, 21, 641083) The handwriting is well formed.
('98', 305, 6, 22, 641115) The language and the writing are not of any Harijan I know.

('98', 305, 7, 24, 641215) 1 The letter is not translated here.
('98', 305, 7, 25, 641252) The correspondent had written that Harijans were admitted into temples anyhow with or without the consent of the trustees and questioned the insistence on getting Harijans admitted into Swaminarayan or Jain temples in which they had no faith.
('98', 305, 7, 26, 641495) 2 Not translated here.
('98', 305, 7, 27, 641518) The correspondent had written that on Makar Sankranti day some Harijans had gone to the local Swaminarayan temple but the doors of the temple were closed to them and that they had been offering satyagraha for having the temple opened without any change in the attitude of the management.

('98', 306, 1, 2, 641853) The distinction drawn by the writer of the first letter has in my opinion no meaning.
('98', 306, 1, 3, 641939) Hindus can and do visit Swaminarayan and Jain temples.
('98', 306, 1, 4, 641994) Harijans should also visit them.
('98', 306, 1, 5, 642027) For years there has been a movement going on to prove that Brahmins and Harijans have equal rights.
('98', 306, 1, 6, 642127) It has met with considerable success.
('98', 306, 1, 7, 642165) Now that the Bombay Government have passed a law to that effect there seems to be no occasion for satyagraha.
('98', 306, 1, 8, 642275) If the law is in conformity with public opinion it should command respect.
('98', 306, 1, 9, 642350) If it is against public opinion, its enforcement will be rather slow.
('98', 306, 1, 10, 642420) In a democracy a law cannot be enforced through coercion.
('98', 306, 1, 11, 642478) It always calls for discerning circumsp ection.
('98', 306, 1, 12, 642526) It will succeed if a reformer takes recourse to it with clear understanding.
('98', 306, 1, 13, 642603) If he is impatient the law will prove a failure.
('98', 306, 1, 14, 642652) Trustees are not the owners of the temples.
('98', 306, 1, 15, 642696) Even those who get the temples built are not the owners if they are built for public use.
('98', 306, 1, 16, 642786) The real owners of the temples are the devotees.
('98', 306, 1, 17, 642835) Devotees are those who visit the temples either for worship or to feign worship.
('98', 306, 1, 18, 642916) Regarded in this light all Jain and Swaminarayan temples are Hindu temples.
('98', 306, 1, 19, 642992) I have myself visited these temples.
('98', 306, 1, 20, 643029) No one even cared to ask me or hundreds like me to which sect we belonged.
('98', 306, 1, 21, 643104) It was enough that I looked a Hindu.
('98', 306, 1, 22, 643141) So where Hindus go Harijans can also go.
('98', 306, 1, 23, 643182) Harijans are not a separate community.
('98', 306, 1, 24, 643221) Enlightened public opinion and the law which embodies that opinion say that they are one of the varnas, be they four or eighteen, comprising Hindu society.
('98', 306, 1, 25, 643377) Therefore the contrary view cannot prevail.
('98', 306, 1, 26, 643421) It is the devotees who make of God a living entity.
('98', 306, 1, 27, 643473) If they are good, the God is good.
('98', 306, 1, 28, 643508) Now the second letter.
('98', 306, 1, 29, 643531) I fail to appreciate the impatience of the Harijans notwithstanding my firm views as stated above.
('98', 306, 1, 30, 643630) Those who insist on going into the temple are not true devotees.
('98', 306, 1, 31, 643695) They do not care for deva darshan, they are running only after their right and away from religion.
('98', 306, 1, 32, 643794) They write anonymous letters or allow others to write for them.
('98', 306, 1, 33, 643858) True devotees will not do such things; they will do what Nandanar 1 did.
('98', 306, 1, 34, 643931) He had no one except God.
('98', 306, 1, 35, 643957) A Brahmin who regards himself as belonging to a higher class gladly worships that Nandanar today.
('98', 306, 1, 36, 644055) I want to see among the Harijans a Nandanar who has become a man of God by his own choice and those who are born Harijans should also wish for the same.
('98', 306, 1, 37, 644208) If non Harijan Hindus want, let them take Harijans to their temples with due respect.
('98', 306, 1, 38, 644294) As long as that does

('98', 308, 8, 18, 646204) BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
('98', 308, 9, 19, 646226) I would request the sisters to remain silent and give me a few minutes.
('98', 308, 9, 20, 646298) I had hardly imagined that I would be required to speak here.
('98', 308, 9, 21, 646360) I have come here on pilgrimage.
('98', 308, 9, 22, 646392) Several days ago I had heard that it might not be possible to hold the Urs at Mehrauli as in the previous years.
('98', 308, 9, 23, 646505) Had it been so I would have been deeply distressed.
('98', 308, 9, 24, 646557) I request you—Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims who have come here with cleansed hearts—to take a vow at this holy place that you will never

('98', 309, 1, 3, 647330) Then the world will admit that though we quarrelled among ourselves as two brothers, ultimately we have not turned into sworn enemies.
('98', 309, 1, 4, 647465) We might be different outwardly but after all we are the offshoots of the same tree.
('98', 309, 1, 5, 647550) I do not want to talk about one who is a slave of Satan.
('98', 309, 1, 6, 647607) I have seen life.
('98', 309, 1, 7, 647625) This is nothing new.
('98', 309, 1, 8, 647646) Even now somewhere or other fighting is going on.
('98', 309, 1, 9, 647696) Only today I have read that Hindus have been killed in the Frontier.
('98', 309, 1, 10, 647765) 1 The Muslims here should be ashamed of it.
('98', 309, 1, 11, 647809) We have to resolve to cleanse our hearts.
('98', 309, 1, 12, 647851) The people massacred there are not going to come back.
('98', 309, 1, 13, 647906) But we must declare and say that we are not going to avenge it by killing anyone.
('98', 309, 1, 14, 647988) We will purify ourselves and meet the opponents with love.
('98', 309, 1, 15, 648047) It would be well for the Hindus if they understood and assimilated this.
('98', 309, 1, 16, 648120) When I broke my fast it was on the condition that the Hindus and Muslims of Delhi would thoroughly cleanse their hearts.

('98', 309, 5, 21, 648411) NEW DELHI, January 27, 1948
('98', 309, 6, 22, 648439) Gandhiji explained how the freedom movement had not been a non violent movement in the highest sense of the term.
('98', 309, 6, 23, 648553) If it had been the non violence of the strong no butchery such as had taken place recently could have come about.
('98', 309, 6, 24, 648667) He discovered this while he was on his pilgrimage in Noakhali and ever since this discovery he had been impressing the fact on everyone.
('98', 309, 6, 25, 648804) He felt that non violence during the struggle for independence was an expedient, i.
('98', 309, 6, 26, 648888) e., resistance to the white man was undertaken in a non violent manner simply because we had no military strength with which to offer battle.
('98', 309, 7, 27, 649030) Gandhiji went on to relate how he had resisted a certain millionaire in South Africa who had introduced him at a public meeting as a mere passive resister and weak
('98', 309, 8, 28, 649194) 1 Non Muslims waiting for evacuation in a camp at Parachinar were attacked by tribesmen on the night of January 22. According to the local authorities, 130 were killed, 50 wounded and 50 abducted.
('98', 309, 8, 29, 649391) 2 A British press correspondent.
('98', 309, 8, 30, 649424) Notes of this interview taken by Amrit Kaur were approved by Gandhiji.
('98', 310, 0, 1, 649495) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 311
('98', 310, 1, 2, 649542) because as an Indian there he was landless and without any rights.
('98', 310, 1, 3, 649609) 1 Gandhiji objected to this description and said that real passive resistance had been miscalled a weapon of the weak.
('98', 310, 1, 4, 649728) After all Jesus Christ had been called the Prince of passive resisters.
('98', 310, 1, 5, 649800) Could he, in any sense of the term, be called a weak man?
('98', 310, 1, 6, 649858) People forget that soul force, the only weapon of the truly non violent man, was a weapon of the strong.
('98', 310, 2, 7, 649963) In reply to the correspondent’s suggestion that many people looked upon non violence as a good opposition weapon in politics and that they could not understand how it could, for example, be used as a positive weapon in Kashmir today or against a man like Hitler who just killed everybody and stamped out opposition in that manner, Gandhiji laughingly replied that he was not in charge of the Government and therefore could not guide their policies; nor did he think that the members of the present Government believed in non violence.
('98', 310, 2, 8, 650498) He recalled how Maulana Saheb had said, “When we gain power we shall not be able to hold it non violently.” Gandhiji said that he had laughed to himself at that time and related the moral of Tolstoy’s story of Ivan the Fool which had always remained with him.
('98', 310, 2, 9, 650758) Hindu scriptures, Gandhiji said, had scores of such stories but he quoted Ivan the Fool because the interviewer might have read the book.
('98', 310, 2, 10, 650896) Ivan remained non violent even when he became king.
('98', 310, 2, 11, 650948) Gandhiji pointed out how the truly non violent man could never hold power himself.
('98', 310, 2, 12, 651031) He derived power from the people whom he served.
('98', 310, 2, 13, 651080) For such a man or such a government, a non violent army would be a perfect possibility.
('98', 310, 2, 14, 651168) The voters then would themselves say, ‘We do not want any military for our defence.’ A non violent army would fight against all injustice or attack but with clean weapons.
('98', 310, 2, 15, 651340) Non violence did not signify that man must not fight against the enemy and by enemy was meant the evil which men did, not human beings themselves.
('98', 310, 2, 16, 651487) He went on to say that if he were the leader of Kashmir like Sheikh Abdullah, he would have such an army but Sheikh Abdullah quite honestly and humbly thought otherwise.
('98', 310, 3, 17, 651657) On the correspondent suggesting a solution of the Kashmir issue on the basis of separation, e.
('98', 310, 3, 18, 651752) g., a predominantly pro Pakistan area like Poonch going to Pakistan and the Kashmir Valley remaining in India Gandhiji had no difficulty in giving a firm answer in the negative.
('98', 310, 3, 19, 651930) He held firmly that India or any part of India could not be divided in this manner.
('98', 310, 3, 20, 652014) It was an evil that must not be allowed to continue.
('98', 310, 4, 21, 652067) 1 According to “A Correction” sent by H. S. L. Polak which appeared in Harijan, 5 9 1948, the reference was obviously to William Hosken who though a well to do businessman, was not a millionaire.
('98', 310, 4, 22, 652263) William Hosken had introduced Gandhiji and the passive resistance movement at a meeting at Germiston in 1909 as follows: “The Transvaal Indians have had recourse to passive resistance when all other means of securing redress proved to be of no avail.
('98', 310, 4, 23, 652514) They do not enjoy franchise.
('98', 310, 4, 24, 652543) They are weak and have no arms.
('98', 310, 4, 25, 652575) Therefore they have taken to passive resistance which is a weapon of the weak.”
('98', 311, 0, 1, 652655) 312 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 311, 1, 2, 652697) Take, for example, Hyderabad; will you separate the town of Hyderabad from the rest of the State?
('98', 311, 1, 3, 652795) Such pockets exist all over India and separation would then become an endless process spelling the ruination of India.
('98', 311, 2, 4, 652914) The interviewer pleaded that the position of Hyderabad was not wholly analogous.
('98', 311, 2, 5, 652995) Any state on a border area was surely different.
('98', 311, 2, 6, 653044) But Gandhiji maintained that it was not possible for states even on the border to be either cut up or separated or .
('98', 311, 2, 7, 653161) to call themselves independent.
('98', 311, 2, 8, 653193) And when the correspondent mentioned Gilgit, Gandhiji recalled that he was in Kashmir 1 when the city of Srinagar was illuminated.
('98', 311, 2, 9, 653324) On asking what the illuminations were for Gandhiji was told that they were celebrating the accession of Gilgit to Kashmir.
('98', 311, 2, 10, 653447) He was sad when he heard the news because he wondered how long Kashmir would hold Gilgit.
('98', 311, 2, 11, 653537) It had been a big bite even for Britain.
('98', 311, 2, 12, 653578) Britain’s policy of keeping on adding to her territories in India had not been either a wise or right policy.
('98', 311, 2, 13, 653688) If Kashmir acceded to India, it would be because of the will of the people as a whole and they would do so well knowing that Gilgit was no part of the Indian Union today.
('98', 311, 2, 14, 653859) There were people who said they would reconquer Gilgit.
('98', 311, 2, 15, 653915) All sorts of complications would then arise.
('98', 311, 2, 16, 653960) Gandhiji said that Britain had made of India a political whole and India must continue as such.
('98', 311, 3, 17, 654056) In reply to a question as to what Pakistan could do with tribal people Gandhiji said: I would accept a challenge of conquering the tribal areas but as a non violent man.
('98', 311, 3, 18, 654226) I would not bribe them, nor kill them; I would serve them.
('98', 311, 3, 19, 654285) Have not missionaries allowed themselves to be eaten by cannibals?
('98', 311, 4, 20, 654352) The correspondent exclaimed, “Alas!
('98', 311, 4, 21, 654388) there are no Gandhis in Palestine, in Russia or in the U. S. A. !”, to which Gandhiji laughingly replied: So much the worse for them.
('98', 311, 5, 22, 654522) In reply to a query as to why Poonch going over to Pakistan was not practicable and that a war between India and the Frontier would be unending, Gandhiji replied that it would be a very bad example to others.
('98', 311, 5, 23, 654731) There were pockets everywhere, for example, Murshidabad in West Bengal.
('98', 311, 5, 24, 654803) The vital difference between the policy of the Indian Union and that of Pakistan was that the former never believed in dismemberment while the Pakistan leaders did.
('98', 311, 5, 25, 654968) Gandhiji quoted the example of Kathiawar.
('98', 311, 5, 26, 655010) Pakistan wanted to vivisect Kathiawar by getting Junagadh to accede to that Dominion.
('98', 311, 5, 27, 655096) Vivisection of Kathiawar which was indivisible was quite unthinkable.
('98', 311, 5, 28, 655166) The whole basis of partition was, in his opinion, wrong.
('98', 311, 5, 29, 655223) Gandhiji admitted that two distinguished persons had suggested the idea of partition of

('98', 312, 2, 3, 655471) In conclusion he asked the correspondent to study things deeply and not superficially.
('98', 312, 2, 4, 655558) He himself was working for a heart union between Hindus and Muslims not only in India but in Pakistan also and would continue his efforts in that direction.

('98', 312, 5, 9, 655913) The following is a summary of the talk we had with him:
('98', 312, 6, 10, 655969) On the question of general membership, on being asked whether the membership of the Congress should be open to all who subscribed to its creed or whether it should be further restricted to those who also agreed with the fundamentals of its socio economic programme, Mahatmaji was of opinion that there need be no necessity for enrolment of members even on the present basis.
('98', 312, 6, 11, 656344) Instead, he suggested that the constituencies should be so limited in area that all adults residing in that locality could participate in the elections to the primary committees, irrespective of the fact whether they formally subscribed to the creed and programme of the Congress or not.
('98', 312, 6, 12, 656632) The reason he advanced in favour of this was, firstly, that the constituency being small every adult in it would be able to exercise his or her judgment in favour of a candidate about whose conduct and work he or she could properly judge.
('98', 312, 6, 13, 656871) The Congress should henceforward be an organization of sevaks who possessed missionary zeal to be able to effect a radical change in the society ensuring justice, tolerance and economic equality.
('98', 312, 6, 14, 657067) Only through such a change in the social outlook could the state be reformed and restrained.
('98', 312, 7, 15, 657160) Secondly, and consequently he wants to avoid the present system of election with its pocket or rotten boroughs and the corruption incidental to it.
('98', 312, 8, 16, 657308) 1 According to the introductory note issued with the “Draft Constitution of Congress” the Constitution Committee met Gandhiji in the morning after the Working Committee meeting held on January 26 and “had the privilege of discussing many important points”.
('98', 312, 8, 17, 657565) Gandhiji was requested to prepare a draft embodying his proposals which he undertook to hand over on January 30.

('98', 313, 1, 2, 657903) Regarding the qualifications of those who are to be eligible to stand as candidates for election to the various Congress Committees he would require everyone to subscribe not only to the creed but also to the fundamentals of the socio economic programme and also to put in some kind of constructive work such as plying the charkha for a stated period or any other manual work besides doing some kind of public work.
('98', 313, 2, 3, 658319) On the question whether the Congress, now that the political power had been transferred to the representatives of Indians, had any role other than that of carrying out the parliamentary activities, Mahatmaji was very emphatic that even for carrying out parliamentary activities the Congress had to carry on constructive activities in the country to maintain contact with the people and to educate them to understand Congress policies and programmes.
('98', 313, 2, 4, 658769) But apart from this kind of activities the Congress had also to rebuild a new society based upon truth and non violence—a society not so much dependent on the existence of a strong and centralized government as on the intelligent co operation of the people organized on a voluntary basis and inspired by the ideals of justice, tolerance and truthfulness.
('98', 313, 2, 5, 659124) He was of opinion that unless the Congress took up this role, the Congress would gradually lose its moral influence and was likely to degenerate into a political party hankering only after power and position.
('98', 313, 2, 6, 659333) Viewed in this context, the Congress must reorganize itself on the basis proposed by him and become eventually a strong and efficient instrument of public service and of public will.
('98', 313, 2, 7, 659516) His suggestion regarding the question of jurisdiction of the Congress was that it should not function in the Pakistan area.
('98', 313, 2, 8, 659640) He said that formerly he was of opinion that it could function in that area but in the changed circumstances brought about by the communal frenzy it would not be proper to function there directly.
('98', 313, 2, 9, 659837) In the case of East Bengal his suggestion was that the Congress could function there if the Government of East Bengal had no objection.
('98', 313, 2, 10, 659973) Regarding States, he was of opinion that the States Peoples’ Conference should continue to function but they should have representatives on the A. I. C. C. and Provincial Congress Committees.

('98', 313, 5, 14, 660267) NEW DELHI, January 27, 1948
('98', 313, 6, 15, 660295) Gandhiji began his post prayer address by asking how many Muslims were present and expressed his disappointment when only one hand went up.
('98', 313, 6, 16, 660435) The other day
('98', 313, 7, 17, 660449) 1 The Hindi version in Prarthana Pravachan has been collated with the report in The Hindustan Times.
('98', 314, 0, 1, 660550) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 315
('98', 314, 1, 2, 660597) he had advised that each Hindu or Sikh should bring at least one Muslim friend along and he had expected they would do that.
('98', 314, 2, 3, 660722) Gandhiji next described his morning visit to the Dargah Sharif at Mehrauli.
('98', 314, 2, 4, 660798) No one had difficulty in visiting the fair.
('98', 314, 2, 5, 660842) When I asked the Muslims whether as many people visited the shrine this year as in the previous years, they said that some at least must have been too frightened to go.
('98', 314, 2, 6, 661011) This shows that there are amongst us people who cause a scare.
('98', 314, 2, 7, 661074) They say that what happened in Allahabad could happen here and ask what the Hindus would do then.
('98', 314, 2, 8, 661172) It is a shameful situation that one man should be frightened of another man.
('98', 314, 2, 9, 661249) But at least I observed at the fair that there were as many Hindus and Sikhs as there were Muslims.
('98', 314, 2, 10, 661349) I also saw something that distressed me.
('98', 314, 2, 11, 661390) The shrine is very ancient.
('98', 314, 2, 12, 661418) It is second only to the Ajmer shrine.
('98', 314, 2, 13, 661457) The chief thing about it was the beauty of its marble carvings and inlay work.
('98', 314, 2, 14, 661536) Much of it, though not all, has been destroyed.
('98', 314, 2, 15, 661584) I was sorry to see it.
('98', 314, 2, 16, 661607) It is sheer vandalism.
('98', 314, 2, 17, 661630) Have we fallen so low that we should violate and desecrate a tomb of a saint on which thousands of rupees had been spent?
('98', 314, 2, 18, 661752) I cannot go into the account that says that what happened in Pakistan was ten times worse.
('98', 314, 2, 19, 661843) To me it is meaningless to consider whether the crime committed was of greater or less magnitude.
('98', 314, 2, 20, 661941) To me it is a shameful thing.
('98', 314, 2, 21, 661971) If the whole world indulges in shameful acts does it mean that we should do the same?
('98', 314, 2, 22, 662057) You will surely agree with me that we should not resort to such shameful conduct.
('98', 314, 2, 23, 662139) I am told the shrine has always attracted large crowds both of Hindus and Muslims who go there to seek fulfilment of some wish.
('98', 314, 2, 24, 662267) It is associated with the name of a saint in whose eyes Hindus and Muslims were all equal.
('98', 314, 2, 25, 662358) This is a matter of history and it does not do to falsify history.
('98', 314, 2, 26, 662425) We should have respect for such men of God and should not be guided by what happens in Pakistan.
('98', 314, 2, 27, 662522) I see from the newspapers today that at one place 1 in Pakistan one hundred and thirty Hindus and Sikhs have been murdered.
('98', 314, 2, 28, 662646) There was also looting.
('98', 314, 2, 29, 662670) There are many small tribes of Muslims around the borders of the Frontier Province.
('98', 314, 2, 30, 662754) These tribals attacked the Hindus and killed them.
('98', 314, 2, 31, 662805) No one says that these Hindus had caused any harm.
('98', 314, 2, 32, 662856) The Pakistan Government says that it took prompt action and many of the attackers were put to death We do not know how far that is true.
('98', 314, 2, 33, 662993) But since the Pakistan Government says so we should accept it.

('98', 315, 1, 2, 663164) not be provoked and start killing the Muslims here.
('98', 315, 1, 3, 663216) Today you are living like brothers but if you harbour any malice in your heart you will be untrue to the pledge you have taken.
('98', 315, 1, 4, 663344) It is for our Government to ask for an account from the Pakistan Government.
('98', 315, 1, 5, 663421) Our part is only to keep our pledge to keep our hearts clean.
('98', 315, 1, 6, 663483) Rajkumari 1 had been on a visit to Ajmer.
('98', 315, 1, 7, 663525) She told me of a tragic and shameful situation.
('98', 315, 1, 8, 663573) It seems the Harijans there, from whom people take a lot of work which they willingly perform, live surrounded by dirt and filth.
('98', 315, 1, 9, 663703) The administration there is our own.
('98', 315, 1, 10, 663740) And the officers— Hindus and Sikhs—work under our Government.
('98', 315, 1, 11, 663802) How can they allow this disgraceful state of affairs to continue?
('98', 315, 1, 12, 663868) There are many white collared Hindus there who earn a lot of money and are quite well to do.
('98', 315, 1, 13, 663961) Why do they not go to the Harijan locality and stay there even for a day?
('98', 315, 1, 14, 664035) If they went there they would be nauseated and some of them might even die.
('98', 315, 1, 15, 664111) It is criminal that people whose only sin is that they were born Harijans should be allowed to live in such squalor.
('98', 315, 1, 16, 664228) I have been to the Harijan locality in Delhi too.
('98', 315, 1, 17, 664278) The conditions there are pretty bad.
('98', 315, 1, 18, 664315) But Ajmer seems to be much worse in this respect.
('98', 315, 1, 19, 664365) We have secured our independence, but it is of no value if we cannot stop such a thing.
('98', 315, 1, 20, 664453) And it can be done in a day.
('98', 315, 1, 21, 664482) Can we not provide a piece of dry ground for the Harijans?
('98', 315, 1, 22, 664541) If they must remove garbage, as they do, must they also be made to live in it?
('98', 315, 1, 23, 664620) We seem to have lost our reason and we have become heartless.
('98', 315, 1, 24, 664682) We have forgotten God.
('98', 315, 1, 25, 664705) That is why we continue to commit such crimes.
('98', 315, 1, 26, 664752) How can we then find fault with others?
('98', 315, 1, 27, 664792) Finally I want to tell you about Mirpur.
('98', 315, 1, 28, 664833) I have referred to the matter briefly earlier.
('98', 315, 1, 29, 664880) Mirpur is in Kashmir.
('98', 315, 1, 30, 664902) It has been occupied by the raiders.
('98', 315, 1, 31, 664939) A number of women and children there have been abducted.
('98', 315, 1, 32, 664996) They include not only young women but also some elderly ones.
('98', 315, 1, 33, 665058) They are in the power of the raiders who, I have no doubt, have violated their honour.
('98', 315, 1, 34, 665145) The food given to them is very bad.
('98', 315, 1, 35, 665181) A few of them are within the border of Pakistan.
('98', 315, 1, 36, 665230) Some of them may have been taken up to the Jhelum in the Gujrat district.
('98', 315, 1, 37, 665304) I must tell the raiders that they must exercise a modicum of restraint.
('98', 315, 1, 38, 665376) What they are doing will bring about the downfall of Islam and yet they say that they are doing all this for a free Kashmir.
('98', 315, 1, 39, 665501) I can understand it if people indulge in plunder and rapine for

('98', 316, 1, 2, 665625) But it is too much to assault innocent young girls and to deprive them of food and clothing.
('98', 316, 1, 3, 665718) Is this what the Koran teaches?
('98', 316, 1, 4, 665750) I must ask the Pakistan Government to recover all the abducted women and girls and let them go back to their homes.
('98', 316, 1, 5, 665866) The Mirpur people who came to me are quite strong and sturdy.
('98', 316, 1, 6, 665928) But they feel disconsolate.
('98', 316, 1, 7, 665956) They ask me why it is that such a powerful Government cannot do anything about this.
('98', 316, 1, 8, 666041) I tried to explain matters to them.
('98', 316, 1, 9, 666077) Jawaharlal himself has been deeply distressed and is trying to do what he can.
('98', 316, 1, 10, 666156) But how does his grieving or his trying help?
('98', 316, 1, 11, 666202) How can those who have lost their all, who have been ruined and separated from their nearest and dearest, be comforted?
('98', 316, 1, 12, 666322) One of the men who came to see me has lost fifteen of his relatives.
('98', 316, 1, 13, 666391) He asked me what was to happen to those still left there.
('98', 316, 1, 14, 666449) I must ask the raiders and the Government of Pakistan, for the sake of humanity and for the sake of God, to return all the abducted women with due respect and without waiting to be asked.
('98', 316, 1, 15, 666637) It is their duty.
('98', 316, 1, 16, 666655) I have enough knowledge of Islam about which I have read a good deal.
('98', 316, 1, 17, 666725) Nowhere does Islam bid people to carry away women and keep them in such a disreputable condition.
('98', 316, 1, 18, 666823) It is irreligion, not religion.
('98', 316, 1, 19, 666855) It is worship of Satan, not of God.

('98', 316, 4, 22, 666989) NEW DELHI, January 27/28, 1948
('98', 316, 5, 23, 667020) Gandhiji’s objection to the use of force was not that force could as well be used to support unrighteous wars; it was fundamental.
('98', 316, 5, 24, 667151) I do not know what is intrinsically good.
('98', 316, 5, 25, 667193) Hence I do not go by results.
('98', 316, 5, 26, 667223) It is enough if I take care of the means.
('98', 316, 6, 27, 667265) For instance, as a nature curist, he did not believe in the use of sulpha drugs.
('98', 316, 6, 28, 667346) Suppose he got typhoid.
('98', 316, 6, 29, 667370) Should he abandon his belief and try to get cured by taking sulpha drugs?
('98', 316, 6, 30, 667444) I do not know whether it is good for me or humanity to be

('98', 317, 1, 2, 667676) cured by the use of sulpha drugs; so I refuse to use sulpha drugs .
('98', 317, 2, 3, 667744) If evil does seem sometimes to result from good, the inference would be that the means employed were probably wrong.
('98', 317, 2, 4, 667861) Good action to produce good results must be supported by means that are pure.
('98', 317, 3, 5, 667939) If those who believe in the idea of non violence keep away from government, government will continue to be carried on by the use of force.
('98', 317, 3, 6, 668078) How is then the transformation of the existing system of government to be brought about?
('98', 317, 4, 7, 668167) Gandhiji admitted that ordinarily government was impossible without the use of force.
('98', 317, 4, 8, 668253) I have therefore said that a man who wants to be good and do good in all circumstances must not hold power.
('98', 317, 5, 9, 668361) Is all government to come to a standstill then?
('98', 317, 5, 10, 668409) No, he (the man of non violence) can send those to the Government who represent his will.
('98', 317, 5, 11, 668499) If he goes there himself, he exposes himself to the corrupting influence of power.
('98', 317, 5, 12, 668582) But my representative holds power of attorney only during my pleasure.
('98', 317, 5, 13, 668653) If he falls a prey to temptation, he can be recalled.
('98', 317, 5, 14, 668707) I cannot recall myself.
('98', 317, 5, 15, 668731) All this requires a high degree of intelligence on the part of the electorate.
('98', 317, 5, 16, 668810) There are about half a dozen constructive work organizations.
('98', 317, 5, 17, 668872) I do not send the workers to the Parliament.
('98', 317, 5, 18, 668917) I want them to keep the Parliament under check by educating and guiding the voters.
('98', 317, 6, 19, 669001) You mean to say that power always corrupts?
('98', 317, 7, 20, 669045) Asked further whether this did not call for a very prolonged and high degree of discipline which it would be too much to expect of common people, he answered, “No.” It was their inertia that made people think so.
('98', 317, 7, 21, 669258) Too much is being made of the study of things that are in my view really of not much consequence to humanity, to the neglect of things eternal.
('98', 317, 7, 22, 669402) Take, for instance, the exact distance of the sun from the earth or the question whether the earth is round.
('98', 317, 7, 23, 669511) The discipline that is necessary to discover the laws that govern life is no less important and yet we say that it is so laborious that only a select few can attain it.
('98', 317, 7, 24, 669680) For instance, we steal in so many ways—not to steal in any shape or form needs some mental poise, contemplation.
('98', 317, 7, 25, 669793) I have given my time not to abstract studies but to the practice of things that matter.
('98', 317, 8, 26, 669881) To Sheean’s question whether misuse of atomic energy might not endanger our

('98', 318, 1, 2, 670032) planet itself since the phenomenal universe is perishable, Gandhiji answered that everything was possible “including the dissolution of appearances.
('98', 318, 1, 3, 670181) 1and the survivors, if any, will then say, ‘what a wondrous spectacle’ ”.
('98', 318, 1, 4, 670255) He very much doubted that the advent of the atomic era would basically affect human problems.
('98', 318, 1, 5, 670349) They claim that one atom bomb changed the entire course of the war and brought the end of war so much the nearer.
('98', 318, 1, 6, 670463) And yet it is so far.
('98', 318, 1, 7, 670485) Has it conquered the Japanese spirit?
('98', 318, 1, 8, 670523) It has not and it cannot.
('98', 318, 1, 9, 670549) Has it crushed Germany as a nation?
('98', 318, 1, 10, 670585) It has not and it cannot.
('98', 318, 1, 11, 670611) To do that would require resorting to Hitler’s method, and to what purpose?
('98', 318, 1, 12, 670687) In the end it will be Hitlerism that will have triumphed.
('98', 318, 2, 13, 670745) The whole of the Gita was an argument in defence of a righteous war, Gandhiji’s visitor argued.
('98', 318, 2, 14, 670841) The last war was a “war in a righteous cause”.
('98', 318, 2, 15, 670888) Yet violence was more rampant as a result than it was ever before.
('98', 318, 2, 16, 670955) Gandhiji agreed so far as the result of the last war was concerned.
('98', 318, 2, 17, 671023) Even in India they had not been able to escape from its back lash.
('98', 318, 2, 18, 671090) See what India is doing.
('98', 318, 2, 19, 671115) See what is happening in Kashmir.
('98', 318, 2, 20, 671149) I cannot deny that it is with my tacit consent.
('98', 318, 2, 21, 671197) They would not lend ear to my counsel.
('98', 318, 2, 22, 671236) Yet, if they were sick of it, I could today point them a way.
('98', 318, 2, 23, 671298) Again, see the exhibition that the United Nations Organization is making.
('98', 318, 2, 24, 671372) Yet I have faith.

('98', 318, 3, 27, 671478) But he did not agree that the Gita was either in intention or in the sum total an argument in defence of a righteous war.
('98', 318, 3, 28, 671600) Though the argument of the Gita was presented in a setting of physical warfare, the “righteous war” referred to in it was the eternal duel between right and wrong that is going on within us.
('98', 318, 3, 29, 671791) There was at least one authority that supported his interpretation.
('98', 318, 3, 30, 671859) The thesis of the Gita was neither violence nor non violence but the gospel of selfless action—the duty of performing right action by right means only, in a spirit of detachment, leaving the fruits of action to the care of God.

('98', 319, 1, 5, 672628) It will be enough now if you do not throw away through impatience what you have gained.
('98', 319, 1, 6, 672716) You have plenty of writing work to do.
('98', 319, 1, 7, 672755) It will keep you sufficiently occupied.
('98', 319, 1, 8, 672795) But don’t do even that at the cost of sleep or exercise.

('98', 319, 7, 21, 673499) Girls who dedicate their lives to the service of their fathers deserve to be admired.

('98', 319, 7, 23, 673605) May you be another.

('98', 319, 7, 25, 673704) They were extremely capable and looked after all their father’s work.
('98', 319, 7, 26, 673774) I do not know what the sisters did after Kabraji’s death.

('98', 320, 6, 7, 674339) LIL I, I have your letter.
('98', 320, 6, 8, 674366) It was wise of you to have stayed back.
('98', 320, 6, 9, 674406) You had better not be impatient.
('98', 320, 6, 10, 674439) I have given you permission to come when your long vacation begins, and that should be enough.
('98', 320, 6, 11, 674534) What are my fasts worth?
('98', 320, 6, 12, 674559) They have become part of me.
('98', 320, 6, 13, 674588) Who can tell when one will burst forth?
('98', 320, 6, 14, 674628) I myself never know.
('98', 320, 6, 15, 674649) This time I have broken the fast in good faith.
('98', 320, 6, 16, 674697) A lot of work is to be done, and everybody can do it.
('98', 320, 6, 17, 674751) That may include you also because self purification can be accomplished wherever one might be.
('98', 320, 6, 18, 674846) One can forge friendship with Muslims, Christians, Parsis, Jews; they can be accepted as our own.
('98', 320, 6, 19, 674944) Thus, even if I were on a fast, rushing to me would be nothing but blind love.
('98', 320, 6, 20, 675023) It is a different thing if I am to be looked after.
('98', 320, 6, 21, 675075) But they have always been looking after me.
('98', 320, 6, 22, 675119) I am writing all this till the Committee 1 arrives.
('98', 320, 6, 23, 675171) You must have your feet cured.

('98', 322, 1, 2, 676976) 317. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING1
('98', 322, 2, 3, 677007) NEW DELHI, January 28, 1948
('98', 322, 3, 4, 677035) Gandhiji said he had received a complaint from some friends in Bahawalpur that they had asked for an appointment with him but failed to get it.
('98', 322, 3, 5, 677179) Gandhiji knew they were in distress and he would manage to find time for them if that would comfort them.
('98', 322, 3, 6, 677285) He, however, desired to assure them that everything possible was being done.
('98', 322, 3, 7, 677362) Dr. Sushila Nayyar and Mr. Leslie Cross went to Bahawalpur and the Nawab has promised to help them in every way.
('98', 322, 3, 8, 677475) In the Union Capital, by the grace of God, there is again peace among the three communities.
('98', 322, 3, 9, 677568) This will certainly improve the situation all over India.
('98', 322, 3, 10, 677626) You know in South Africa our people are fighting for their rights.
('98', 322, 3, 11, 677693) Here in India there are no laws depriving the people of the right of owning land or living wherever they please.
('98', 322, 3, 12, 677806) It is true we have reduced Harijans to some such condition but for the rest of society that is not so.
('98', 322, 3, 13, 677909) But I have seen with my own eyes that that is so in South Africa.
('98', 322, 3, 14, 677975) The Indians therefore are having to put up a struggle to safeguard their rights and in defence of the honour of India.
('98', 322, 3, 15, 678094) They can resort to various means in their struggle but they claim to be satyagrahis and their struggle has taken the form of satyagraha.
('98', 322, 3, 16, 678231) They keep on sending cables.
('98', 322, 3, 17, 678260) They cannot even move from one province to another without a permit.
('98', 322, 3, 18, 678329) South Africa is like a continent.
('98', 322, 3, 19, 678363) It is a very large country.
('98', 322, 3, 20, 678391) Indians wishing to go to the Transvaal from Natal can do so only if they have a permit.
('98', 322, 3, 21, 678479) They say it is as much their country as anyone else’s and ask why there should be such restrictions imposed on their movements.
('98', 322, 3, 22, 678607) Many have succeeded in moving to the Transvaal and the Government this time have been decent.
('98', 322, 3, 23, 678701) They have not been arrested so far.
('98', 322, 3, 24, 678737) They first went to Volksrust which is the first city after crossing the border.
('98', 322, 3, 25, 678817) There were policemen present in strength but they only looked on and did not arrest them.
('98', 322, 3, 26, 678907) There they found a motor vehicle and proceeded in it further on.
('98', 322, 3, 27, 678972) Then a meeting was held there at which they were given a warm welcome.
('98', 322, 3, 28, 679043) I thought I should give you this information.
('98', 322, 3, 29, 679089) Those Indians have performed an act of great courage.
('98', 322, 3, 30, 679143) Indians in South Africa are few in number but, if they all become true satyagrahis, their victory is certain and no obstacle can stop them.
('98', 322, 3, 31, 679283) But this has yet to be achieved.
('98', 322, 3, 32, 679316) There are, as

('98', 323, 0, 1, 679431) 324 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 323, 1, 2, 679473) here, many kinds of people.
('98', 323, 1, 3, 679501) There are Hindus and there are Muslims.
('98', 323, 1, 4, 679541) They all work together.
('98', 323, 1, 5, 679565) They know they cannot fight their battle separately.
('98', 323, 1, 6, 679618) They have reached Johannesburg but they cannot stop there.
('98', 323, 1, 7, 679677) They must go on and on till they are arrested.
('98', 323, 1, 8, 679724) The Government have a right to arrest them, for satyagraha implies the acceptance of punishment for the violation of a law.
('98', 323, 1, 9, 679848) They deserve congratulations.
('98', 323, 1, 10, 679878) I shall ask the Government of South Africa not to be too severe with people who carry on their struggle with such decency.
('98', 323, 1, 11, 680001) They should understand their grievances and come to a settlement with them.
('98', 323, 1, 12, 680077) Why should it be that one with a white skin cannot have a dialogue with one with a black skin?
('98', 323, 1, 13, 680172) Why should Indians have to fight for their legitimate rights?
('98', 323, 1, 14, 680234) How does it harm the whites if Indians too are allowed to live there?
('98', 323, 1, 15, 680304) Today we are also a free country as South Africa is and are members of the same Commonwealth, which implies that we should all live like brothers and equals.
('98', 323, 1, 16, 680462) But if they consider Indians their enemies and deprive them of their basic civic rights, then they are not behaving as friends but as enemies.
('98', 323, 1, 17, 680605) It is something which is difficult to understand.
('98', 323, 1, 18, 680655) Why should they look down on the coloured people?
('98', 323, 1, 19, 680705) Is it because they are industrious and thrifty?
('98', 323, 1, 20, 680753) I shall tell the Government of South Africa through this meeting that it should mend its ways.
('98', 323, 1, 21, 680848) I have myself lived in South Africa for twenty years and I can therefore say that it is my country.
('98', 323, 1, 22, 680948) I should have told you all this yesterday but I could not do so.
('98', 323, 1, 23, 681013) Some Muslims from Mysore had sent me a wire a few days ago saying that my fast had produced no effect there and Muslims were still being killed there.
('98', 323, 1, 24, 681164) I had also said a few words on the matter.
('98', 323, 1, 25, 681207) 1 Now I have a telegram from the Home Minister of Mysore in which he has refuted the charge made in the wire and has explained that the Government is trying to be just to the Muslims.
('98', 323, 1, 26, 681391) I must tell the Muslims of Mysore what I have told all others, namely, that they should not indulge in exaggeration.
('98', 323, 1, 27, 681508) This hampers me and I am able to do nothing.
('98', 323, 1, 28, 681553) If anything they should try to water down such reports.
('98', 323, 1, 29, 681609) This is the only way Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs can live as brothers.
('98', 323, 1, 30, 681678) Our people are so simple that they send money by post.
('98', 323, 1, 31, 681733) I recollect an incident from my childhood.
('98', 323, 1, 32, 681776) My father had some jewellery among which was a valuable pearl.
('98', 323, 1, 33, 681839) He mailed it by post.
('98', 323, 1, 34, 681861) That was not cheating but it certainly was risky because, if anybody had suspected it, they could have opened the envelope.
('98', 323, 1, 35, 681985) In any case the

('98', 324, 1, 2, 682093) money was not saved because he wanted the acknowledgment by wire.
('98', 324, 1, 3, 682159) It seems there still are innocent people like my father.
('98', 324, 1, 4, 682216) A friend sent currency notes of over a thousand rupees in this way.
('98', 324, 1, 5, 682284) He had the envelope neither registered nor insured.
('98', 324, 1, 6, 682336) He sent it by ordinary post.
('98', 324, 1, 7, 682365) When there is dishonesty and corruption everywhere it is a matter of great credit to our Post office that envelopes with money are safely delivered.
('98', 324, 1, 8, 682514) They do not even want to see what an envelope might contain.
('98', 324, 1, 9, 682575) My advice to people who send money like this is not to take such risk because in the postal department there are bound to be some dishonest men and, if the money is misappropriated in the post, the loss will be mine or that of the Harijans for whom this money is intended, and also of the donor.
('98', 324, 1, 10, 682871) I congratulate the postal department on displaying such honesty.
('98', 324, 1, 11, 682936) Let the other departments follow their example and take care of other people’s money and keep away from graft and peculation.

('98', 325, 3, 5, 683886) VIJ AYA, You did well in writing to me.
('98', 325, 3, 6, 683926) It is a matter of shame that you should be put to such straits.
('98', 325, 3, 7, 683990) It is being delayed probably because the arrangements are new.
('98', 325, 3, 8, 684053) I hope everything will be all right.

('98', 325, 8, 14, 684257) KAN AIYO, I talk at length with Abha and thus save time by omitting to write to you.
('98', 325, 8, 15, 684342) On the whole I like your letters.
('98', 325, 8, 16, 684376) There is scope for a few improvements which can come in course of time.
('98', 325, 8, 17, 684448) About your coming, I have for the time being left the decision to you.
('98', 325, 8, 18, 684519) And that seems to be the only right thing to do.
('98', 325, 8, 19, 684568) Right now I don’t feel that you must come over, but when you do, you will be coming in your own right.
('98', 325, 8, 20, 684671) This is what I have told Abha.
('98', 325, 8, 21, 684702) And this I think will lead to her development.
('98', 325, 8, 22, 684749) Also she will be of the maximum use to you.
('98', 325, 8, 23, 684793) I am writing a postcard because I think it will reach you the earliest.
('98', 325, 8, 24, 684865) I understand you eat nothing but uncooked food.
('98', 325, 8, 25, 684913) I wish that you should not undertake this experiment.
('98', 325, 8, 26, 684967) Your body is like that of Hanuman 1; if you ruin it you will be liable to punishment.
('98', 325, 8, 27, 685053) The body is the true temple for God to dwell in.
('98', 325, 8, 28, 685102) Bear this in mind when you make use of your body.
('98', 325, 8, 29, 685152) Don’t shrink from writing to me.
('98', 325, 8, 30, 685185) My leaving this place is not definite.
('98', 325, 8, 31, 685224) Perhaps I may visit Wardha for twelve days.

('98', 326, 3, 7, 685610) What can I write to you?
('98', 326, 3, 8, 685635) What comfort could I give?
('98', 326, 3, 9, 685662) Death is a true friend.
('98', 326, 3, 10, 685686) It is only our ignorance that causes us grief.
('98', 326, 3, 11, 685733) Sulochana’s spirit was yesterday, is today and will remain tomorrow.
('98', 326, 3, 12, 685802) The body, of course, must die.
('98', 326, 3, 13, 685833) Sulochana has gone taking her failings with her, leaving the good in her behind.
('98', 326, 3, 14, 685914) Let us not forget that or her.
('98', 326, 3, 15, 685945) Be even more true in the discharge of your duty.

('98', 326, 7, 21, 686269) I have written to him.
('98', 326, 7, 22, 686292) My proposed visit there is still in the air.
('98', 326, 7, 23, 686337) I have mooted the idea of my staying at Sevagram from 3rd to 12th.
('98', 326, 7, 24, 686404) If my mission is regarded to have been accomplished, I need not stay on here now for the fulfilment of my pledge.
('98', 326, 7, 25, 686518) Whether or not it can be so regarded will depend on the co workers here.
('98', 326, 7, 26, 686591) Probably we shall be able to arrive at some decision tomorrow.
('98', 326, 7, 27, 686654) The purpose of my visit will be to discuss the possibility of uniting the various organizations for

('98', 327, 6, 10, 687813) What Bapuji said I am writing to you in my own words.
('98', 327, 6, 11, 687867) Hoshiaribehn had gone to Khurja, but she is now back here.
('98', 327, 6, 12, 687926) She returned only yesterday.
('98', 327, 6, 13, 687955) She goes back to Khurja today, as some physician there has promised to restore her to health in a month’s time.
('98', 327, 6, 14, 688067) She has decided to take his treatment, and Bapuji has approved of her decision.
('98', 327, 6, 15, 688147) Bapuji says: “Hoshiari will be able to devote herself fully to serving others only after she is physically all right herself, and so I have agreed to her taking the treatment of this physician.”

('98', 327, 9, 19, 688504) 324. INTERVIEW TO MARGARET BOURKE WHITE1
('98', 327, 10, 20, 688545) NEW DELHI, January 29, 1948
('98', 327, 11, 21, 688573) Margaret Bourke White discussed with Gandhiji the doctrine of trusteeship.
('98', 327, 11, 22, 688648) Bapu had once said that the rich should be trustees for the poor.
('98', 327, 11, 23, 688714) How did he define a trustee?
('98', 327, 12, 24, 688743) 1 This and the following item are reproduced from P. B. Chandwani’s article “The Master at Work”.
('98', 327, 12, 25, 688841) Margaret Bourke White, American photographer and Life magazine correspondent, introduced herself as the “Torturer”, a title Gandhiji had conferred on her earlier in Bengal.
('98', 328, 0, 1, 689014) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 329
('98', 328, 1, 2, 689061) A trustee is one who discharges the obligations of his trust faithfully and in the best interests of his wards.
('98', 328, 2, 3, 689173) Did he know of any industrialist who lived up to that ideal?
('98', 328, 2, 4, 689234) No, though some are striving in that direction, my host, G. D. Birla, for instance.
('98', 328, 2, 5, 689318) I hope he is not deceiving me.
('98', 328, 2, 6, 689349) If I saw him do so, I would not live under his roof.
('98', 328, 3, 7, 689402) Did he still cherish the wish and hope to live the full span of life?
('98', 328, 3, 8, 689472) He had lost that wish, Gandhiji said, in view of the prevailing darkness.
('98', 328, 3, 9, 689546) He was, however, groping for light.
('98', 328, 3, 10, 689582) If things took a turn for the better and the people responded to his call and co operated to usher in a new era of peace and amity, he would again wish—indeed, he would be “commanded” to wish to live the full span.
('98', 328, 3, 11, 689797) “Would you advise America to give up the manufacture of atom bombs?” she finally asked.
('98', 328, 3, 12, 689885) Most certainly.
('98', 328, 3, 13, 689901) As things are, the war ended disastrously and the victors are vanquished by jealousy and lust for power.
('98', 328, 3, 14, 690006) Already a third war is being canvassed, which may prove even more disastrous.
('98', 328, 3, 15, 690084) Ahimsa is a mightier weapon by far than the atom bomb.
('98', 328, 3, 16, 690139) Even if the people of Hiroshima could have died in their thousands with prayer and goodwill in their hearts, the situation would have been transfor med as if by a miracle.

('98', 328, 6, 19, 690380) NEW DELHI, January 29, 1948
('98', 328, 7, 20, 690408) The interviewer, an American lady, asked Bapu what America with her interest in India and her well being could do for India.
('98', 328, 8, 21, 690533) 1 What follows is reported by Margaret Bourke White in her book Halfway to Freedom under the date January 30, 1948. 2 At this stage the interviewer presented some pictures taken by her for Gandhiji’s autograph in order to complete her questions.
('98', 328, 8, 22, 690779) Mahatma Gandhi—The Last Phase carries the following version of the interview: “ How would you meet the atom bomb .
('98', 328, 8, 23, 690894) with non violence?’, “I will not go underground.
('98', 328, 8, 24, 690943) I will not go into shelter.
('98', 328, 8, 25, 690971) I will come out in the open and let the pilot see I have not a trace of ill will against him.
('98', 328, 8, 26, 691065) The pilot will not see our faces from his great height, I know.
('98', 328, 8, 27, 691129) But the longing in our hearts—that he will not come to harm—would reach up to him and his eyes would be opened.
('98', 328, 8, 28, 691241) “If those thousands who were done to death in Hiroshima, .
('98', 328, 8, 29, 691300) had died with that prayerful action—died openly with that prayer in their hearts—their sacrifice would not have gone in vain.” 3 Of the World Headquarters in Switzerland
('98', 329, 0, 1, 691470) 330 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 329, 1, 2, 691512) Gandhiji said that American visitors should endeavour to see India through Indian spectacles.
('98', 329, 1, 3, 691606) They could go round and offer friendly and constructive criticism but to describe its dirty spots as India would be a caricature.
('98', 329, 1, 4, 691736) Here Bapu recalled the instance of Emily Kinnaird 1, who had invited herself to be Gandhiji’s guest in Bombay 2. She was content with the vegetarian food and modest comforts she could get and always insisted on walking with him to the prayer ground.
('98', 329, 1, 5, 691986) Till the moment of her death, she continued to write long and delightful letters to Bapu, pouring out her heart and spirit.
('98', 329, 2, 6, 692110) Asked what foreign missions could do in the new set up for Indian Christians or Christian Indians as they would now like to be called, Bapu replied that the best course would be to leave them to their own resources, to help them settle down as sons of the soil.

('98', 329, 4, 9, 692421) NEW DELHI, January 29, 1948
('98', 329, 5, 10, 692449) BRO THERS AND SIS TERS, Of the many things I wish to tell you, I have chosen six for today, for I must finish in 15 minutes.
('98', 329, 5, 11, 692574) I notice that we are beginning a little late, which is wrong.
('98', 329, 5, 12, 692636) Sushila has gone to Bahawalpur, to see the refugees still stranded there.
('98', 329, 5, 13, 692710) She has no other mission.
('98', 329, 5, 14, 692736) Mr. Leslie Cross of the Friends’ Service has gone with her.
('98', 329, 5, 15, 692796) My idea was that someone from the Friends, Unit should go and observe the conditions of refugees there and report to me.
('98', 329, 5, 16, 692917) There was no proposal for Sushila to go.
('98', 329, 5, 17, 692958) But when she heard about the plan she suggested that she be permitted to accompany Mr. Cross.
('98', 329, 5, 18, 693052) She has known him ever since she went to Noakhali.
('98', 329, 5, 19, 693103) She is an efficient doctor and she belongs to the Gujrat district in the Punjab.
('98', 329, 5, 20, 693184) She too has suffered a good deal.
('98', 329, 5, 21, 693218) She had a large property which she has lost.
('98', 329, 5, 22, 693263) But her heart has not become poisoned.
('98', 329, 5, 23, 693302) She said it would help if she went because she could speak Punjabi, Hindustani, Urdu and English and could be of use to Mr. Cross.
('98', 329, 5, 24, 693433) I was delighted.
('98', 329, 5, 25, 693450) There are of course hazards but she said

('98', 330, 1, 2, 693697) she was not afraid.
('98', 330, 1, 3, 693717) Had she been afraid she would not have gone to work in Noakhali.
('98', 330, 1, 4, 693782) Many people who live in the Punjab have been completely ruined in every way.
('98', 330, 1, 5, 693859) At least she.
('98', 330, 1, 6, 693873) can still find food and other provisions.
('98', 330, 1, 7, 693915) I consulted Mr. Cross and he welcomed the idea.
('98', 330, 1, 8, 693963) He said she could act as an interpreter.
('98', 330, 1, 9, 694004) He is from the Red Cross.
('98', 330, 1, 10, 694030) The function of the Red Cross is to provide medical relief to war victims.
('98', 330, 1, 11, 694105) Whether Dr. Sushila went with Mr. Cross or Mr. Cross went with Sushila is a complicated question but they are friends and like each other.
('98', 330, 1, 12, 694244) They have gone to render service and not to make money.
('98', 330, 1, 13, 694300) They will observe and give me a report of what they see.
('98', 330, 1, 14, 694357) The Nawab keeps writing to me.
('98', 330, 1, 15, 694388) After I have the report from Mr. Cross and Sushila Nayyar I shall tell you more about the matter.
('98', 330, 1, 16, 694486) Some people, perhaps forty of them, from Bannu had come to me.
('98', 330, 1, 17, 694549) They have suffered hardships no doubt but they are able to walk.
('98', 330, 1, 18, 694614) Some had injured fingers, some had other wounds on other parts of the body.
('98', 330, 1, 19, 694690) I saw them just now and told them to explain everything to Brijkrishna.
('98', 330, 1, 20, 694762) They were all respectable men.
('98', 330, 1, 21, 694793) They must have been full of anger but they accepted my advice.
('98', 330, 1, 22, 694856) One of them—I did not ask whether he was a refugee—said I had done enough harm already and that I should stop and disappear from the scene.
('98', 330, 1, 23, 694996) He did not care whether I was a mahatma.
('98', 330, 1, 24, 695037) I asked him where he wanted me to go.
('98', 330, 1, 25, 695075) He said that I might go to the Himalayas.
('98', 330, 1, 26, 695117) I had to rebuke him.
('98', 330, 1, 27, 695138) He is not as old as I am and is stronger.
('98', 330, 1, 28, 695180) But I could not afford to become nervous.
('98', 330, 1, 29, 695222) I asked why I should go to the Himalayas merely because he wished it, when there were many who wanted me to stay.
('98', 330, 1, 30, 695336) There are many who praise me and there are others who abuse me.
('98', 330, 1, 31, 695400) What am I to do?
('98', 330, 1, 32, 695417) I can only do as God bids.
('98', 330, 1, 33, 695444) You may say that you do not believe in God.
('98', 330, 1, 34, 695488) But then you must allow me to go my way.
('98', 330, 1, 35, 695529) God is the help of the afflicted.
('98', 330, 1, 36, 695563) But an afflicted person is not God.
('98', 330, 1, 37, 695599) When I claim that every woman is my own sister or daughter, then her suffering becomes my suffering.
('98', 330, 1, 38, 695700) Why do you presume that I do not understand the sufferings of the refugees?
('98', 330, 1, 39, 695776) Why do you presume that because I am a friend of Muslims I am an enemy of Hindus and Sikhs?
('98', 330, 1, 40, 695868) I cannot run away because anyone wants me to run away.
('98', 330, 1, 41, 695923) I have not taken to service at any one’s bidding.
('98', 330, 1, 42, 695973) I have become what I have become at the bidding of God.
('98', 330, 1, 43, 696029) God will do what He wills.
('98', 330, 1, 44, 696056) He may take me away.
('98', 330, 1, 45, 696077) I shall not find peace by going to the Himalayas.
('98', 330, 1, 46, 696127) I want to find peace in the midst of turmoil or I want to die in the turmoil.
('98', 330, 1, 47, 696205) My Himalayas are here.

('98', 331, 1, 2, 696270) I keep receiving complaints about the refugees.
('98', 331, 1, 3, 696318) They are given food and drink and clothing and they are helped in every possible way.
('98', 331, 1, 4, 696404) But they do not want to work.
('98', 331, 1, 5, 696434) I have said that if the refugees want to end their sufferings, if they want to convert suffering into happiness and serve India and serve themselves, they must not shirk work.
('98', 331, 1, 6, 696610) A refugee has no right to live comfortably without working.
('98', 331, 1, 7, 696670) The Gita says: “Eat only after you have performed yajna.” Eat what remains after the yajna.
('98', 331, 1, 8, 696762) This has not been said only for me but also for you and all others.
('98', 331, 1, 9, 696830) It applies also to the refugees.
('98', 331, 1, 10, 696863) Even if a millionaire eats and does not work, he is a burden on the earth.
('98', 331, 1, 11, 696938) Of course one can understand if you are a cripple, or if you are blind or too old.
('98', 331, 1, 12, 697021) But a robust man has no excuse for not working.
('98', 331, 1, 13, 697069) Let those who are strong of body clean lavatories in the camp; let them spin, let them do any other work that comes to hand.
('98', 331, 1, 14, 697194) Let them teach their boys.
('98', 331, 1, 15, 697221) Someone came to see me today.
('98', 331, 1, 16, 697251) I forget his name.
('98', 331, 1, 17, 697270) He mentioned peasants.
('98', 331, 1, 18, 697293) I said if I had my way our Governor General would be a peasant; our Prime Minister would be a peasant.
('98', 331, 1, 19, 697396) In my childhood I learnt a poem which says “O farmer, you are the king, the master of the whole world”.
('98', 331, 1, 20, 697500) What would we eat if the peasant did not produce food?
('98', 331, 1, 21, 697555) But today we have made him a slave.
('98', 331, 1, 22, 697591) What can a peasant do?
('98', 331, 1, 23, 697614) Must he acquire academic degrees such as B.A. and M.A.?
('98', 331, 1, 24, 697670) If he does that he will be ruined.
('98', 331, 1, 25, 697705) He will be no more good for wielding the pickaxe.
('98', 331, 1, 26, 697755) If the man who produced foodgrain out of the earth becomes our Chief, our Prime Minister, the face of India will change.
('98', 331, 1, 27, 697876) There is a scarcity of food in Madras.
('98', 331, 1, 28, 697915) A representative of the Madras Government had come here to plead with Shri Jairamdas 1 that he should make foodgrain available for Madras.
('98', 331, 1, 29, 698054) This attitude of the people of Madras saddens me.
('98', 331, 1, 30, 698104) I want to point out to them that they can find enough things to eat in their own province such as groundnut, coconut and various other things.
('98', 331, 1, 31, 698247) They also have plenty of fish which most of them take.
('98', 331, 1, 32, 698302) What need is there for them to go out and beg?
('98', 331, 1, 33, 698349) It is not right for them to insist on rice and that too polished rice which has all its food value removed or to insist on wheat in place of rice.
('98', 331, 1, 34, 698496) They can mix groundnut flour or coconut flour with rice

('98', 332, 1, 3, 698868) What they need is self confidence and dedication.
('98', 332, 1, 4, 698918) I know the people of Madras quite well.
('98', 332, 1, 5, 698958) I had with me in South Africa people drawn from all the linguistic areas of the Province.
('98', 332, 1, 6, 699048) During the satyagraha march 1 they were given a pound and a half of bread and an ounce of sugar each day.
('98', 332, 1, 7, 699154) But they surprised me when on our striking camp they would pick out some edible greens or some other thing and cook it singing away in great delight.
('98', 332, 1, 8, 699304) How can such resourceful people ever feel so helpless?
('98', 332, 1, 9, 699359) True we were all coolies.
('98', 332, 1, 10, 699385) But then in honest work lies our freedom and the satisfaction of all our basic needs.

('98', 332, 5, 15, 699581) NEW DELHI, January29, 1948
('98', 332, 6, 16, 699608) Though split into two, India having attained political independence through means devised by the Indian National Congress, the Congress in its present shape and form, i.
('98', 332, 6, 17, 699778) e., as a propaganda vehicle and parliamentary machine, has outlived its use.
('98', 332, 6, 18, 699855) India has still to attain social, moral and economic independence in terms of its seven hundred thousand villages as distinguished from its cities and towns.
('98', 332, 6, 19, 700013) The struggle for the ascendency of civil over military power is bound to take place in India’s progress towards its democratic goal.
('98', 332, 6, 20, 700146) It must be kept out of unhealthy competition with political parties and communal bodies.
('98', 332, 6, 21, 700235) For these and other similar reasons, the A. I. C. C. resolves to disband the existing Congress organization and flower into a Lok Sevak Sangh under the following rules with power to alter them as occasion may demand.
('98', 332, 7, 22, 700452) 1 Which commenced on November 6, 1913. 2 Acharya Jugal Kishore, General Secretary of A. I. C. C., released this draft to the Press on February 7, with the note: “As something has already appeared in the Press .
('98', 332, 7, 23, 700663) regarding the proposals which Mahatmaji had made concerning changes in the Congress constitution I am releasing the full draft as was handed to me on the fateful forenoon of 30th January.
('98', 332, 7, 24, 700851) .” This appeared in Harijan under the title “His Last Will and Testament”.
('98', 332, 7, 25, 700926) In his article “The Fateful Friday”, in Harijan, Pyarelal writes: “The whole of the 29th had been so cram full with work that at the end of the day Gand hiji felt

('98', 333, 1, 2, 701131) Every panchayat of five adult men or women being villagers or village minded shall form a unit.
('98', 333, 1, 3, 701227) Two such contiguous panchayats shall form a working party under a leader elected from among themselves.
('98', 333, 1, 4, 701331) When there are one hundred such panchayats, the fifty first grade leaders shall elect from among themselves a second grade leader and so on, the first grade leaders meanwhile working under the second grade leader.
('98', 333, 1, 5, 701545) Parallel groups of two 1 hundred panchayats shall continue to be formed till they cover the whole of India, each succeeding group of panchayats electing a second grade leader after the manner of the first.
('98', 333, 1, 6, 701751) All second grade leaders shall serve jointly for the whole of India and severally for their respective areas.
('98', 333, 1, 7, 701861) The second grade leaders may elect, when.
('98', 333, 1, 8, 701903) ever they deem necessary, from among themselves a chief who will, during pleasure, regulate and command all the groups.
('98', 333, 1, 9, 702023) (As the final formation of provinces or districts is still in a state of flux, no attempt has been made to divide this group of servants into provincial or district councils and jurisdiction over the whole of India has been vested in the group or groups that may have been formed at any given time.
('98', 333, 1, 10, 702322) It should be noted that this body of servants derive their authority or power from service ungrudgingly and wisely done to their master, the whole of India.) 2
('98', 333, 2, 11, 702482) 1. Every worker shall be a habitual wearer of khadi made from self spun yarn or certified by the A. I. S. A. and must be a teetotaller.
('98', 333, 2, 12, 702618) If a Hindu, he must have abjured untouchability in any shape or form in his own person or in his family and must be a believer in the ideal of inter communal unity, equal respect and regard for all religions and equality of opportunity and status for all irrespective of race,

('98', 333, 3, 14, 702915) “My head is reeling.
('98', 333, 3, 15, 702936) And yet I must finish this,” he remarked to Abha, pointing to the draft constitution for the Congress which he had undertaken to prepare, and then, “I am afraid I shall have to keep late hours.” The next morning Gandhiji revised the draft and gave it to Pyarelal to “go through it carefully”.
('98', 333, 3, 16, 703229) He added: “Fill in any gaps in thought that there might be.
('98', 333, 3, 17, 703289) I wrote it under a heavy strain.” When Pyarelal took the revised draft to him he “went through the additions and alterations point by point with his characteristic thoroughness and removed an error in calculation that had crept in in regard to the number of panchayats.” 1 The copy available in the A.I.C.C. files has a question mark here.

('98', 335, 3, 4, 705429) I had had one of those rarest of rare experiences, that of being alone with Bapu for a moment.
('98', 335, 3, 5, 705524) It was my customary call at 9.30. He was in bed.
('98', 335, 3, 6, 705573) I stepped in and was greeted by “what news?” .
('98', 335, 3, 7, 705620) had no news to give.
('98', 335, 3, 8, 705641) So I asked: “How does the ship of State fare?’, He said: I am sure the little differences 2 will vanish.
('98', 335, 3, 9, 705746) But things may have to await my return from Wardha.
('98', 335, 3, 10, 705798) That won’t be long.
('98', 335, 3, 11, 705818) The Government is composed of patriots and no one will do anything that is in conflict with the interests of the country.
('98', 335, 3, 12, 705940) I am sure that they must hold together at all costs and they will.
('98', 335, 3, 13, 706007) There is no difference of substance.
('98', 335, 4, 14, 706044) There was more conversation on the same lines and I would have invited the usual “crowd’, even at that hour, had I tarried.
('98', 335, 4, 15, 706168) So, preparing to leave, I said: “Bapu, will you sleep now?” No, there is no hurry.

('98', 336, 3, 4, 706953) Passing out of the room at the end of the massage, Gandhiji .
('98', 336, 3, 5, 707015) inquired if I had finished the revision 2 and further asked me to prepare a note on how to meet the threatened food crisis in Madras in the light of my experience and experiment in Noakhali.
('98', 336, 3, 6, 707206) The Food Ministry is feeling nervous.
('98', 336, 3, 7, 707244) But I maintain that a province like Madras that is blessed by nature with cocoanut and palm, ground nut and banana in such plenty, not to mention roots and tubers of various kinds, need not starve, if only the people know how to husband their resources in food.

('98', 336, 7, 11, 707577) I put before Gandhiji the case for orderly evacuation 3, but his view was emphatic and clear.
('98', 336, 7, 12, 707671) Just as we, workers, had to “Do or Die”, even so had we to prepare our people to “Do or Die” for the vindication of their self respect, honour and right of religious freedom.
('98', 336, 7, 13, 707846) Maybe in the end only a few will be left.
('98', 336, 7, 14, 707888) But there is no other way of evolving strength out of weakness.
('98', 336, 7, 15, 707952) Are not ranks decimated in the war of weapons too?
('98', 336, 7, 16, 708003) How can it be otherwise under non violence then?
('98', 336, 7, 17, 708052) What you are doing is the way.
('98', 336, 7, 18, 708083) You have shed the fear of death and established yourself in the hearts and affections of the people.
('98', 336, 7, 19, 708184) To love and diligence must be joined knowledge.
('98', 336, 7, 20, 708232) This you have done.
('98', 336, 7, 21, 708252) If you alone do your part fully and well, you will cover the whole lot.
('98', 336, 7, 22, 708324) You know, I need you here, the burden is so heavy.
('98', 336, 7, 23, 708375) And there is a lot I would like to share with the world which I cannot do now that you are away.

('98', 337, 5, 7, 708983) Sudhir Ghosh, among other things, read out to Gandhiji a cutting from the London Times and extracts from a letter from an English friend showing how some people were assiduously trying to drive a wedge between Pandit Nehru and Sardar Patel by traducing the latter as a communalist, while pretending to praise the former.
('98', 337, 5, 8, 709304) Gandhiji remarked that he was aware of the move and was deeply excercised over it.
('98', 337, 5, 9, 709387) He had already dealt with it, he said, in one of his post prayer speeches 2, which had been published in the Harijan.
('98', 337, 5, 10, 709505) But he felt that something more needed to be done.

('98', 337, 10, 17, 709928) Agatha’s letter said that the whispering campaign about a serious rift between his two lieutenants Mr. Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel had spread to London and The Times editorial on this rift between the two men was a bad omen; was Gandhiji not going to do something about it?” 2 Vide “Speech at Prayer Meeting”, 20 1 1948. 3 Sudhir Ghosh reports: He finished the writing of whatever he was working at and said, “I wonder what I am going to do about it”—as if asking himself a question.
('98', 337, 10, 18, 710412) I said, “Well they are so big that nobody dares to talk to them about it; but people talk behind their backs.
('98', 337, 10, 19, 710522) Some day you may like to talk to both of them about it.
('98', 337, 10, 20, 710578) You alone can do it.” He pondered over my remark and said, “Well, there is something in what you say.
('98', 337, 10, 21, 710680) I think I am going to talk about it.

('98', 338, 1, 2, 711012) all his plans would be upset.
('98', 338, 1, 3, 711042) The Maulanas said they had no wish to detain him on their account, for they knew that he would be working for them wherever he was.
('98', 338, 1, 4, 711174) The interval would enable them to assess and report to him how the implementation of the pledges given as a result of his fast was progressing.
('98', 338, 1, 5, 711318) They hoped he would be able to return to Delhi by the 14th February.
('98', 338, 1, 6, 711387) Gandhiji replied: I do expect to be back here by the 14th.
('98', 338, 1, 7, 711446) But if Providence has decreed otherwise, that is a different matter.
('98', 338, 1, 8, 711515) I am not, however, sure whether I shall be able to leave here even the day after tomorrow.

('98', 338, 4, 13, 711821) No one realizes how much harm we are doing to society by being engaged in our personal feuds.
('98', 338, 4, 14, 711915) But what can you or anyone else do about it?
('98', 338, 4, 15, 711960) This indicates a failure on my part.
('98', 338, 4, 16, 711997) What could anyone do when God made me blind to these things?
('98', 338, 4, 17, 712058) But let me set things right as far as possible, while I am alive, so that the coming generation may not hurl abuses at me.
('98', 338, 4, 18, 712181) If I succeed in it, I shall regard it as God’s grace.
('98', 338, 4, 19, 712235) I ought to take up this task.
('98', 338, 4, 20, 712265) 1 The diaries should be edited well and compiled.
('98', 338, 4, 21, 712315) Narahari’s health does not permit any work and .
('98', 338, 5, 22, 712364) has dissociated himself from all my activities.
('98', 338, 5, 23, 712412) But how can it be said that he has done so without full understanding?
('98', 338, 5, 24, 712483) Everyone is entitled to freedom of thought.
('98', 338, 5, 25, 712527) If Chandrashankar 3 shoulders this responsibility he will exhibit his talents as well.
('98', 338, 5, 26, 712614) What similarity between the handwritings of the two!
('98', 338, 5, 27, 712667) I shall write to him.

('98', 339, 3, 4, 713169) Bapu said in an exceedingly tender voice that all this had distressed him beyond measure.
('98', 339, 3, 5, 713259) Outwardly he seemed light and happy but his heart was smitten with grief at the wave of insanity which was sweeping over the land.
('98', 339, 3, 6, 713390) Either this must end or he must perish.
('98', 339, 4, 7, 713430) He also referred to the advice offered to him by a refugee 2 to retire to the Himalayas.
('98', 339, 4, 8, 713519) Chuckling with laughter he observed that nothing would be better in one sense: he would develop into a double Mahatma and attract larger crowds.
('98', 339, 4, 9, 713664) But what he wanted was not vainglory or ease but such comfort and strength as he could extract out of the prevailing darkness and misery.

('98', 339, 7, 13, 713883) Although he had previously expressed his view, Gandhiji told the Sardar, that one of the two—either the Sardar or Pandit Nehru—should withdraw from the Cabinet, he had since come to the firm conclusion that the presence there of both of them was indispensable.
('98', 339, 7, 14, 714144) Any breach in their ranks at that stage would be disastrous.
('98', 339, 7, 15, 714205) He further said he would make that the topic of his post prayer speech in the evening.
('98', 339, 7, 16, 714292) Pandit Nehru would be seeing him after the prayer; he would discuss the question with him too.
('98', 339, 7, 17, 714387) If necessary, he would postpone his going to Sevagram and not leave Delhi till he had finally laid the spectre of disunity between the two.
('98', 339, 8, 18, 714527) 1 Reproduced from P. B. Chandwani’s article “The Master at Work” The deputation, led by Choithram Gidwani, narrated the woes of Sindhis and spoke of the restrictions imposed by the Pakistan Government on their evacuation.

('98', 339, 8, 21, 714921) At 4.30 p.
('98', 339, 8, 22, 714932) Abha brought Gandhiji his evening meal.
('98', 339, 8, 23, 714972) It was getting near prayer time.
('98', 339, 8, 24, 715005) But the Sardar had still not finished.
('98', 339, 8, 25, 715044) Abha felt fidgety, knowing the great importance that Gandhiji attached to punctuality, particularly in regard to prayer time.
('98', 339, 8, 26, 715170) But she dared not interrupt.
('98', 339, 8, 27, 715199) At last, becoming desperate, she picked up his watch and held it before him to draw his attention.
('98', 339, 8, 28, 715298) But it was no good.
('98', 339, 8, 29, 715318) Noting her predicament, Manibehn Patel tactfully intervened.”

('98', 340, 5, 6, 715643) “Bapu, your watch must be feeling very neglected.
('98', 340, 5, 7, 715693) You would not look at it,” remarked Abha.
('98', 340, 5, 8, 715735) Why should I, since you are my time keepers?
('98', 340, 6, 9, 715780) “But you do not look at the time keepers”, rejoined one of them.
('98', 340, 6, 10, 715845) Bapu again laughed.
('98', 340, 6, 11, 715865) The last remark he uttered as he cleared the steps leading to the prayer ground was: It is your fault that I am ten minutes late.
('98', 340, 6, 12, 715995) It is the duty of nurses to carry on their work even if God himself should be present there.
('98', 340, 6, 13, 716088) If it is time to give medicine to a patient and one feels hesitant about it, the poor patient will die.
('98', 340, 6, 14, 716192) So it is with prayers.
('98', 340, 6, 15, 716215) It irks me if I am late for prayers even by a minute.
('98', 340, 7, 16, 716269) Harijan, 15 2 1948, and Dilhiman Gandhiji—II, pp.
('98', 340, 8, 17, 716319) 1 In his letter to Jawaharlal Nehru dated February 5, 1948, while referring to this talk Vallabhbhai Patel wrote: “I had the good fortune to have a last talk with him for over an hour just before his death and he communicated to me what had passed between you and him as well as his talk with H. E. [Lord Mountbatten].
('98', 340, 8, 18, 716638) He had also fixed an appointment to meet both of us the next day.
('98', 340, 8, 19, 716704) His opinion also binds us both and I can assure you that I am fully resolved to approach my responsibilities and obligations in this spirit.” 2 The report in Pyarelal’s “The Fateful Friday”, has been collated with the Gujarati version in Dilhiman Gandhiji.
('98', 340, 8, 20, 716961) 3 According to Manu Gandhi’s account, as Gandhiji passed along the cordoned lane through the prayer congregation, he took his hands off the shoulders of the two girls to acknowledge the namaskars of the prayer congregation.
('98', 340, 8, 21, 717185) All of a sudden someone from the crowd roughly elbowed his way towards them.
('98', 340, 8, 22, 717262) Manu Gandhi, thinking that he was coming forward to touch Gandhiji’s feet, remonstrated saying something about it being already late for the prayer and tried to stop the intruder by thrusting back his hand.
('98', 340, 8, 23, 717469) He violently pushed her away, causing the notebook, the spittoon and the mala, which she was carrying in her hands, to fall down.
('98', 340, 8, 24, 717599) As she stooped down to pick up the scattered things, he planted himself in front of Gandhiji and fired in quick succession three shots at point blank range.
('98', 340, 8, 25, 717756) The last words Gandhiji uttered were “Hey Ram”.
('98', 340, 8, 26, 717804) A spreading crimson spot appeared on the white clothes.
('98', 340, 8, 27, 717860) The hands which had been raised in namaskar to the gathering slowly came down.
('98', 340, 8, 28, 717939) The limp body softly sank to the ground.
('98', 340, 8, 29, 717980) Gandhiji breathed his last at 5.17 p.
('98', 341, 0, 1, 718018) 342 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 341, 1, 2, 718060) 338. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS 1
('98', 341, 2, 3, 718088) Q.1. Is it possible to recite Ramanama from the heart even while talking to someone, doing arduous mental work or when mentally perturbed?
('98', 341, 2, 4, 718227) If people do so even under such conditions, how do they manage it?
('98', 341, 3, 5, 718294) A. Experience tells us that whatever the situation a person may be in, even if he may be asleep, if he has formed the habit, and if Ramanama fills his heart, recitation of Ramanama will continue as long as the heart beats.
('98', 341, 3, 6, 718517) Otherwise, it may said that he utters Ramanama only with his lips, or if occasionally it enters the heart, it certainly does not reign in the heart.
('98', 341, 3, 7, 718666) When Ramanama rules the heart, it is needless to ask how the recitation is carried on.
('98', 341, 3, 8, 718753) For, when the Name has found a place in the heart, recitation is superfluous.
('98', 341, 3, 9, 718831) It would be correct to say that those whose hearts are thus permeated by Ramanama are few.
('98', 341, 3, 10, 718922) I have no doubt that Ramanama does indeed possess the power attributed to it.
('98', 341, 3, 11, 719000) Not everyone can have Ramanama inscribed in his heart by merely wishing it.
('98', 341, 3, 12, 719076) It requires a tireless effort and also patience.
('98', 341, 3, 13, 719125) How can one find the philosopher’s stone without patience?
('98', 341, 3, 14, 719184) Ramanama is superior to it.
('98', 341, 4, 15, 719212) Q.2. Is it from a certain mental weakness that one sees so many layers of the mind, or is it necessary for the mind to pass through all these stages before reaching a state of steadiness?
('98', 341, 4, 16, 719400) Why is it that even in the waking state dreamlike visions come and go?
('98', 341, 4, 17, 719471) How is it that phantoms of things never experienced in life appear in the mind or echo in the heart?
('98', 341, 5, 18, 719572) A. Before arriving at steadiness of mind almost everyone has to pass through stages enumerated in the question.
('98', 341, 5, 19, 719684) That is to say, those who have in the former life striven without achieving success will not need to pass through agony in the present birth.
('98', 341, 5, 20, 719826) When the mind is calm but one still has dream like experiences, it only means that though the mind appears calm on the surface, it is not in fact calm.
('98', 341, 5, 21, 719978) That there are visions of things not related to experience, means, in my view, that apart from memory, there are many other things involved.
('98', 341, 6, 22, 720119) 1 In this section of undated items, letters and notes from Gandhiji to individuals have been put together in the alphabetical order of surnames, as it has not been possible to establish conclusive evidence of the period to which they belong.
('98', 341, 6, 23, 720361) However, an occasional inference as regards the date of an item is ventured in a footnote to the title.
('98', 342, 0, 1, 720465) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 343
('98', 342, 1, 2, 720512) Q. 3. When work of service makes demands of one, sometimes it is not possible to pursue devotional activity.
('98', 342, 1, 3, 720621) Is this harmful?
('98', 342, 1, 4, 720638) What should be considered more important – service or recitation of God's name?
('98', 342, 2, 5, 720718) A. Whether it is the demands of work or even sterner demands, the recitation of the Ramanama may never be stopped.
('98', 342, 2, 6, 720833) Its outward expression may be modified depending on the circumstances.
('98', 342, 2, 7, 720904) Even if one does not count the beads, can Ramanama which is inscribed in the heart, be abandoned?

('98', 342, 4, 11, 721077) 339. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS 1
('98', 342, 5, 12, 721105) 1. There is life and there is death.
('98', 342, 5, 13, 721142) Freedom from all bondage is moksha.
('98', 342, 5, 14, 721178) 2. He who consders himself in bondage is a bound person.
('98', 342, 5, 15, 721235) It is attachment.
('98', 342, 5, 16, 721253) He is bound by the bonds of attachment.
('98', 342, 5, 17, 721293) Knowingly or unknowingly, he seeks freedom from it.
('98', 342, 5, 18, 721345) 3. Freedom that needs replenishing is not freedom.
('98', 342, 5, 19, 721396) He who is free is the best.
('98', 342, 5, 20, 721424) 4. There is not the slightest external difference between a bound and a free man.
('98', 342, 5, 21, 721506) A free man recognizes himself.
('98', 342, 5, 22, 721537) Even while doing, he does not do, for he never yearns for reward.
('98', 342, 5, 23, 721603) He does his deeds by force of the previous sanskaras 2. 5. No activity is possible for the one who is free.
('98', 342, 5, 24, 721711) For him there is nothing that remains to be attained.
('98', 342, 5, 25, 721765) 6. Rama, Krishna, etc., who are settled in my imagination are free souls to my mind.
('98', 342, 5, 26, 721850) My emancipated Rama and Krishna have nothing at all to do with the Rama and Krishna of history.
('98', 342, 5, 27, 721946) This is a matter of imagina tion.
('98', 342, 5, 28, 721980) In truth, only the emancipated can recognize the emancipated.
('98', 342, 5, 29, 722042) I have not become emancipated myself.
('98', 342, 5, 30, 722080) 7. Apart from non vegetarianism, I have written about the historical Buddha.
('98', 342, 5, 31, 722157) But that would be like proud words from an under serving person.
('98', 342, 5, 32, 722222) I see no harm in regarding the Buddha as a perfect,
('98', 342, 6, 33, 722274) 1 Posed by Maganbhai Shankerbhai Patel 2 This is followed by a quotation in Sanskrit, which is not clear in the source,

('98', 343, 1, 2, 722436) and hence, an emancipated being.
('98', 343, 1, 3, 722469) 8. I started accepting the existence of God when I accepted the existence of soul.
('98', 343, 1, 4, 722552) Prior to that my condition was similar to that of an atheist if not exactly of an atheist.
('98', 343, 1, 5, 722643) During my search for Truth I discovered the soul.
('98', 343, 1, 6, 722693) If there is nothing like soul, then a truthful action may even be a sin.
('98', 343, 1, 7, 722766) But I got firmly convinced that truthful action is meritorious action at all times and thus I disocvered the soul.
('98', 343, 1, 8, 722881) 9. God’s form is incomprehensible.
('98', 343, 1, 9, 722916) Reason can somehow grasp it.
('98', 343, 1, 10, 722945) It is clear from experience.
('98', 343, 1, 11, 722974) I have the experience as far as faith goes.
('98', 343, 1, 12, 723018) But that experience is not such that all perversities of (my) mind can be said to have vanished.
('98', 343, 1, 13, 723115) 10. Faith means belief in something which we cannot prove to others or in something that others cannot prove (to us).
('98', 343, 1, 14, 723233) I have faith in both these senses.
('98', 343, 1, 15, 723268) Once we fully believe that faith can do everything, we have no place anywhere, or being in it, our place is everywhere.
('98', 343, 1, 16, 723388) It is absolutely true that I wanted to live.
('98', 343, 1, 17, 723433) It was out of pride that I had a yearning that my body still had a function to perform.
('98', 343, 1, 18, 723521) It is still there.
('98', 343, 1, 19, 723540) Even while knowing that every disease lies there, it is not destroyed.
('98', 343, 1, 20, 723611) My physical senses are pulling me perforce and do not let me give up my ego.
('98', 343, 1, 21, 723688) 11. The greatest endeavour is endeavour for moksha.
('98', 343, 1, 22, 723740) Moksha means elimination of ego.
('98', 343, 1, 23, 723773) I prevail into everybody.
('98', 343, 1, 24, 723799) The first step is the intense experience that I am unhappy when others are unhappy and I am happy when others are happy.
('98', 343, 1, 25, 723920) When that happens, the ego can hardly persist.
('98', 343, 1, 26, 723967) In the midst of disturbances, I find and experience peace.
('98', 343, 1, 27, 724026) How can there be peace when there is misery everywhere?
('98', 343, 1, 28, 724082) But if that misery has to be eliminated, I have got to be calm, and therefore, I remain calm.
('98', 343, 1, 29, 724176) If I do something grievously wrong for the sake of swaraj, Swami Ramatirtha’s 1 description of it as a night would be correct.
('98', 343, 1, 30, 724303) Swami Vivekananads's view is also correct that our rise with the help of the world implies the welfare of the world.
('98', 343, 1, 31, 724420) 12. Fate means the acts one has committed.
('98', 343, 1, 32, 724463) Clearly, I am reaping the reward for what I did yesterday.
('98', 343, 1, 33, 724522) 13. Truth, non violence and the keen observance of brahmacharya, etc.
('98', 343, 1, 34, 724592) are a means to attain moksha.
('98', 343, 1, 35, 724622) 14. Moksha means elimination of all action, that is, elimination

('98', 344, 1, 3, 724803) But that elimination is possible only by burning away the desire for reward.
('98', 344, 1, 4, 724880) Action is connected with the body and it will go on.
('98', 344, 1, 5, 724933) We must be its witness.
('98', 344, 1, 6, 724957) That is why I would always read, always spin.
('98', 344, 1, 7, 725003) And yet I can believe that I am not reading: I am not spinning.
('98', 344, 1, 8, 725067) This can be experienced.
('98', 344, 1, 9, 725092) It cannot be explained.
('98', 344, 1, 10, 725116) 15. And I do not see place for anyone in the Ashram who wishes to merely indulge in meditation without any concrete physical activity.
('98', 344, 1, 11, 725251) In the Ashram one has to learn to concentrate only on one thought while eating or drinking, sitting or sleeping, or wielding the pick axe.
('98', 344, 1, 12, 725390) That alone is true meditation.
('98', 344, 1, 13, 725421) One who merely indulges in meditation has a place in the world.
('98', 344, 1, 14, 725485) His livelihood depends on God.
('98', 344, 1, 15, 725516) He subsists only by whatever easily falls into his hands.
('98', 344, 1, 16, 725574) 16. You must think of action in a wider sense.
('98', 344, 1, 17, 725621) Thereby you will see that you will act till the end.
('98', 344, 1, 18, 725674) With that in view, physical labour has been given an unassailable position in the Ashram.
('98', 344, 1, 19, 725764) The only thing we can do is to take away the element of ego from it.
('98', 344, 1, 20, 725833) The principle would be that everybody would do physical yajna for everybody else.
('98', 344, 1, 21, 725915) We would work for the sake of the Ashram and so, even though working the whole day, we would feel grateful.
('98', 344, 1, 22, 726023) 17. Desire for a son is opposed to moksha.
('98', 344, 1, 23, 726066) Hence, it does not behove a person desiring moksha to have physical contact with women.
('98', 344, 1, 24, 726154) And any contact with an outside woman would be worse than an animal pursuit.
('98', 344, 1, 25, 726231) What more can I explain here?
('98', 344, 1, 26, 726261) There is only attachment in the article by Andrews.
('98', 344, 1, 27, 726313) It will vanish in course of time because his heart is pure.

('98', 344, 4, 32, 726520) I am ashamed I cannot say what will happen tonight.
('98', 344, 4, 33, 726572) How can I come there under these circumstances?
('98', 344, 4, 34, 726620) Hence, I am sending somebody who would give you the information and explain.
('98', 344, 4, 35, 726697) Now our programme is also likely to change a little.

('98', 345, 7, 7, 727072) The rule about khadi is generally not applicable in jail.
('98', 345, 7, 8, 727130) If they do not allow us to wear our own clothes, then we can wear whatever is provided.
('98', 345, 7, 9, 727218) If the jail food does not suit us, we can ask for whatever food that suits us.
('98', 345, 7, 10, 727297) If that is not given, then we should eat what is given if it agrees with us.
('98', 345, 7, 11, 727374) If not leave it to the jail authorities to change it.
('98', 345, 7, 12, 727428) You can certainly ask for the facility for daily spinning routine.
('98', 345, 7, 13, 727495) Generally it is given.

('98', 345, 12, 17, 727620) ., Received your beautiful letter.
('98', 345, 12, 18, 727655) It is beautiful mainly because you have described in it your state of mind at the time of being beaten up.
('98', 345, 12, 19, 727762) You tried to contain your anger at that time and therein was your non violence.
('98', 345, 12, 20, 727842) With such practice non violence would ultimately become natural and, as a result, everyone would give up the feeling of animosity.
('98', 345, 12, 21, 727973) But only in the case of one in a million does non violence become a natural practice.
('98', 345, 12, 22, 728059) We are only trying to pursue that path.
('98', 345, 12, 23, 728099) I experience every moment that nothing else is as interesting as that effort.
('98', 345, 12, 24, 728177) Just as a
('98', 345, 13, 25, 728187) 1 It is presumed that this and the following 22 letters obtained from the diary of Narandas Gandhi were written during Gandhiji’s incarceration in Yeravda Central Prison in the years 1930 1933. Gandhiji euphemistically referred to the prison as “Yeravda Mandir.” The addressee’s names, however, are not ascertainable.

('98', 346, 1, 2, 728552) hungry man nurtures himself daily by eating nutritious food, so also a man suffering from the hunger of non violence drinks deep of the nectar of non violence and nurtures himself and takes long draughts of joy.

('98', 346, 6, 7, 728931) Even we are not without defects.
('98', 346, 6, 8, 728964) Remembering that, we should bear with others.
('98', 346, 6, 9, 729010) The afflicted person should not submit to injustice in spite of having to suffer hardships.
('98', 346, 6, 10, 729102) The same rule applies to the spectator.

('98', 346, 10, 13, 729224) ., Received your letter.
('98', 346, 10, 14, 729249) As far as I remember, I have developed in the following manner.
('98', 346, 10, 15, 729313) Truth, non violence, non possession, brahmacharya, fearles sness, indifference to taste.
('98', 346, 10, 16, 729402) During my quest for truth, I saw the need for non violence, and so, I tried to cultivate it.
('98', 346, 10, 17, 729495) From that arose the need for non possession.
('98', 346, 10, 18, 729540) But I felt everything was hard without brahmacharya.
('98', 346, 10, 19, 729593) This led to the discovery of satyagraha.
('98', 346, 10, 20, 729634) This gave me fearlessness.
('98', 346, 10, 21, 729661) I have since been practising indifference to taste.
('98', 346, 10, 22, 729713) But now I realize that indifference to taste was necessary for the observance of brahmacharya.
('98', 346, 10, 23, 729808) This is the main thing.
('98', 346, 10, 24, 729832) I hope you are not asking similar questions about swadeshi, untouchability, etc.?
('98', 346, 10, 25, 729914) I have been able to cultivate these qualities due to deep thinking and effort.
('98', 346, 10, 26, 729993) Behind all that, there is no doubt an unflinching faith in God.

('98', 347, 2, 5, 730414) But is this necessary?
('98', 347, 2, 6, 730437) So far as I know, J. is quite happy but even if it was otherwise, sympathetic suffering would not be called for in such a case.

('98', 347, 5, 12, 730889) Good conduct means good work in which we can concentrate ourselves.
('98', 347, 5, 13, 730957) Now let the world sink or swim, for to the extent that the sinking or the swimming of the world is in our hands, we are making our efforts.

('98', 347, 8, 22, 731563) He will do that which you and I would not be able to do.
('98', 347, 8, 23, 731620) ‘That’ means passion, and includes also the bad habits of people.

('98', 348, 1, 3, 732041) How is it that two persons with contradictory natures are born in the same house?
('98', 348, 1, 4, 732123) If such a question is asked, the reply would be that we have not known the good and bad characteristics of Mast and his father and their elders.
('98', 348, 1, 5, 732268) Hence, we do not have sufficient means to pass any judgement and let us not even have a desire to know that.
('98', 348, 1, 6, 732377) It would suffice to know the Law of Karma.

('98', 348, 4, 10, 732592) Give up the temptation of reward.
('98', 348, 4, 11, 732626) Thinking is more necessary than reading.
('98', 348, 4, 12, 732667) But if thoughts do not come systematically, then reading is the only recourse.
('98', 348, 4, 13, 732746) It would suffice even if you can spare a quarter of an hour every day.
('98', 348, 4, 14, 732817) The story of the two is a tragic one.

('98', 348, 6, 16, 732923) 349. A LETTER
('98', 348, 7, 17, 732937) The two questions raised by you are worth consideration.
('98', 348, 7, 18, 732994) But, if they are rationally considered, many other questions arise from them and they take us to the point when man should resort to fasting and go into samadhi.
('98', 348, 7, 19, 733156) The concept of renunciation seems to have been born only out of such ideas.
('98', 348, 7, 20, 733232) But what we know as renunciation would prove to be incomplete from the rational point of view.
('98', 348, 7, 21, 733327) Hence, the ultimate course would be resorting to fast.
('98', 348, 7, 22, 733382) But man cannot do it, and even if he does make an attempt, his mind is likely to imagine all kinds of things.
('98', 348, 7, 23, 733492) It seems to me that the origin of the Gita lies in such a line of thought.
('98', 348, 7, 24, 733567) And the Gita shows us on the one hand the ideal of life, and on the other, shows us how to conduct ourselves in life while pursuing that ideal.
('98', 348, 7, 25, 733711) In one sentence it is like this: Keeping the ideal in view, properly discharge whatever duty one may be called upon to do and crave for no reward.
('98', 348, 7, 26, 733858) It is by following this line that the problems arising at the Ashram get solved.
('98', 348, 7, 27, 733939) If a thief came to the Ashram, we would let him stay.
('98', 348, 7, 28, 733993) But we humbly admit our inability to do so, and
('98', 349, 0, 1, 734041) 350 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 349, 1, 2, 734083) solve the situation in a manner that would behove us.
('98', 349, 1, 3, 734137) We have not discovered a purely non violent way of dealing with the cattle, animals, birds and the insects that come and destroy our harvests.
('98', 349, 1, 4, 734280) Hence, we practise certain violence, considering it unavoidable in recognition of our own weakness.
('98', 349, 1, 5, 734380) Otherwise, I know that driving away the cattle by shouting or hitting them with a stick, creating fright in the heart of a bird by throwing a pebble at it, destroying the insects by crushing them under the plough or by any other method, driving away snakes and such creatures or even permitting killing them, are all against the principle of non violence.
('98', 349, 1, 6, 734736) But since the Ashram or the inmates of the Ashram have not reached the stage of perfection, these things are being done even though they are inconsistent with the principle of non violence.
('98', 349, 1, 7, 734926) For that way alone is it possible to discover a path to moksha.
('98', 349, 1, 8, 734990) I have no doubt that sitting back after stopping all activity is even worse than doing such things which are against the principle of non violence.
('98', 349, 1, 9, 735138) That is exactly why the author of the Gita has said that just as behind every fire there is the fault of smoke, human beings are also afflicted with some fault or the other.
('98', 349, 1, 10, 735312) Man should realize this and be humble.
('98', 349, 1, 11, 735351) And he should discharge the duty he is destined to discharge in a spirit of service and realize that whatever the consequences may be, he is merely an instrument in the hands of God.

('98', 351, 2, 4, 737655) We should never think that today’s conditions are painful or sad.
('98', 351, 2, 5, 737721) We should not feel tired if the circumstances of today persist for a long time.
('98', 351, 2, 6, 737801) If we consider these times something to feel sad about, we are bound to feel tired also.
('98', 351, 2, 7, 737890) Moreover, from our point of view, activity in itself is useful and is educative in one way or other.
('98', 351, 2, 8, 737991) Let us discard those activities about which this cannot be said.
('98', 351, 2, 9, 738056) From this point of view also, it is not necessary to give up stage performances.
('98', 351, 2, 10, 738137) There is no need at all to make a distinction between a musical concert and drama, physical exercise and sports.
('98', 351, 2, 11, 738250) And there is no need also to make a distinction between all these activities and the subjects taught in school.
('98', 351, 2, 12, 738362) Now, coming to that bhajan, whenever we have perfectly under stood a particular thing and we have come to like it, we can say that our mind has become completely absorbed in it.
('98', 351, 2, 13, 738540) Anyone who has become so absorbed, does not proclaim aloud his joy, but remains lost in his joy.
('98', 351, 2, 14, 738637) Similarly, one who merges in God can also be said to be in a state of ecstasy.
('98', 351, 2, 15, 738716) And when one has attained that state, what more is there to be said?
('98', 351, 2, 16, 738785) This is what the poet has sung.
('98', 351, 2, 17, 738817) The poet has then taken the example of diamond.
('98', 351, 2, 18, 738865) When one has a diamond in his possession, one does not keep taking it out and looking at it.
('98', 351, 2, 19, 738958) He knows that he has the diamond with him and that consciousness gives him sufficient satisfaction.
('98', 351, 2, 20, 739058) Similarly, he who has come to have faith in God, will never lose his faith.
('98', 351, 2, 21, 739134) Repeatedly taking out the diamond is a sign of lack of faith.
('98', 351, 2, 22, 739196) That is why the poet has said, now that you have got the diamond in the form of God, why do you show lack of faith and why do you go on bidding with it?

('98', 352, 1, 2, 739681) But as we become more and more devoted to truth, we feel more and more ashamed to conceal our faults.
('98', 352, 1, 3, 739783) One feels relieved when the faults are exposed.
('98', 352, 1, 4, 739831) I can say that at least for myself.
('98', 352, 1, 5, 739867) But the limit that you have pointed out is not unjustified.
('98', 352, 1, 6, 739927) We feel at peace by admitting our faults before the One whom we regard as our Advocate.
('98', 352, 1, 7, 740015) Even this much is more than sufficient.
('98', 352, 1, 8, 740055) You do know this much.
('98', 352, 1, 9, 740078) I keep things secret when people request me to keep them to myself.
('98', 352, 1, 10, 740146) But when matters involving other people are brought to me on condition that I keep them secret, I refuse to hear about them.

('98', 352, 1, 12, 740315) .and ask me not to refer it to Chi.

('98', 352, 4, 17, 740499) 357. A LETTER
('98', 352, 5, 18, 740513) I was very happy to receive your letter.
('98', 352, 5, 19, 740554) In a way, it is only good that Pandit Sukhlal is learning English.
('98', 352, 5, 20, 740621) But I doubt if it would help him in fulfilling his purpose.
('98', 352, 5, 21, 740681) That requires a very thorough study of English.
('98', 352, 5, 22, 740729) It is another matter if he can spare that much time.
('98', 352, 5, 23, 740782) I am reminded of the experience of Narayan Hemachandra.
('98', 352, 5, 24, 740838) He was under the impression that one can do translations by having working knowledge of languages.
('98', 352, 5, 25, 740937) He had made such attempts in English and French and I know that there were many errors in his translations.
('98', 352, 5, 26, 741045) But how could an ordinary student like me convince a well known writer like Narayan Hemachandra?
('98', 352, 5, 27, 741142) He did not agree and today I know that his effort was wasted because he was not even able to publish what he had written.
('98', 352, 5, 28, 741264) And if he did publish something about which I had no knowledge, it is forgotten by now.
('98', 352, 5, 29, 741352) This instance must be cited to Panditji.
('98', 352, 5, 30, 741393) He will draw a lesson from it if it is worthwhile.
('98', 352, 5, 31, 741444) All I know is that whatever we do must be done well or not done at all.
('98', 352, 5, 32, 741516) And doing it well means doing it correctly, which is the first step.
('98', 352, 5, 33, 741585) If there is no mastery over language, it often results in howlers like mistaking
('98', 352, 6, 34, 741666) There are nearly fifteen English translations of the Gita.
('98', 352, 6, 35, 741725) Some of them are utterly ridiculous.
('98', 352, 6, 36, 741762) The translators had earned
('98', 352, 7, 37, 741789) 1 A favourite analogy used by Gandhiji.
('98', 353, 0, 1, 741829) 354 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 353, 1, 2, 741871) a name in their own respective fields, but they do not seem to have considered at all whether or not they were qualified to do the translation.
('98', 353, 1, 3, 742015) The result is that there is a terrible mess with regard to some slokas.
('98', 353, 1, 4, 742087) Let it be clear to Sukhlalji that all this is said not by way of criticism but in a spirit of friendship.
('98', 353, 1, 5, 742193) Since Sukhlalji has worked in the field of archaeology, I expect from him correctness, truthfulness and zeal in every matter.
('98', 353, 1, 6, 742319) And, it is to convey my experience to him that I am writing this much.
('98', 353, 1, 7, 742390) Feel free to write anything you wish to the Sardar or even to me.
('98', 353, 1, 8, 742456) Moreover, we both have time to ponder and discuss things.
('98', 353, 1, 9, 742514) I do not recall our having had such an opportunity ever since we came to know each other.
('98', 353, 1, 10, 742604) It is all right that you went to Santiniketan.
('98', 353, 1, 11, 742651) Somehow, we have to render some service.
('98', 353, 1, 12, 742692) Do write regularly from there too.
('98', 353, 1, 13, 742727) Keep on sending to me whatever you think I should read.

('98', 354, 7, 14, 744386) You ask me what service one can render in jail !
('98', 354, 7, 15, 744435) My reply is that while in jail, one must qualify oneself for service.

('98', 354, 12, 20, 744665) It is all right that you asked the question .
('98', 354, 12, 21, 744711) The answer can be found only from my letters.
('98', 354, 12, 22, 744757) Happiness and unhappiness are states of mind.
('98', 354, 12, 23, 744803) But when do we realize that it is a state of mind?
('98', 354, 12, 24, 744854) Never through reading.
('98', 354, 12, 25, 744877) It can be realized only through experience.
('98', 354, 12, 26, 744921) Hence unha ppiness is necessary.
('98', 354, 12, 27, 744954) Here, the meaning of unhappiness is what the world understands by it.
('98', 354, 12, 28, 745024) Physical illness, onslaughts on the body, scarcity of food, being robbed, being insulted, etc., are the states of unhappiness that are mentally experienced.
('98', 354, 12, 29, 745181) He who is a devotee, a yogi, who is unified with the Brahman, who is detached, does not count such situations as unhappiness and remains content even by

('98', 355, 1, 2, 745376) them, just as he is content with so called happiness.
('98', 355, 1, 3, 745430) Thus, by attaining a sense of indifference, the state of self knowledge is realized.
('98', 355, 1, 4, 745515) Do you get the point?

('98', 355, 6, 11, 745850) Instead of speaking the truth as far as possible, why should you not speak the truth as you know it, no matter what happens?
('98', 355, 6, 12, 745975) I have seen from experience that once you are determined, no vow is as easy to keep as this.
('98', 355, 6, 13, 746068) Once it is realized that you have to speak only the truth, there is no question at all of speaking an untruth.

('98', 356, 3, 9, 747227) Such a statement is an expression of our lack of faith.
('98', 356, 3, 10, 747283) It also speaks of our ignorance.

('98', 356, 3, 12, 747397) If we cannot make even that much sacrifice, what can we do for Mother India?
('98', 356, 3, 13, 747474) And is it a sacrifice?
('98', 356, 3, 14, 747497) Ultimately, we ourselves would wear the clothes made from that very yarn, would we not?

('98', 357, 1, 5, 748481) That way your system would be cleansed and you will be able to work.

('98', 362, 3, 4, 755419) DEAR SHANKERLAL, Your letter does credit to you.
('98', 362, 3, 5, 755468) Why do you ask me to tear it up?
('98', 362, 3, 6, 755501) With your permission, I intend to send that very letter to Anandanand.
('98', 362, 3, 7, 755572) In any case you should come here.
('98', 362, 3, 8, 755606) You say a follower of mine has hurt you.
('98', 362, 3, 9, 755647) Does it mean that you are not my follower?
('98', 362, 3, 10, 755690) If you are not my follower, I do not know who else is.
('98', 362, 3, 11, 755745) In fact, I have and also do not have followers.
('98', 362, 3, 12, 755793) I have innumberable colleagues.
('98', 362, 3, 13, 755825) I do not claim they are my followers.
('98', 362, 3, 14, 755863) Those who believe themselves to be my followers make that claim.
('98', 362, 3, 15, 755928) I am not responsible for it.
('98', 362, 3, 16, 755957) I do not exercise my authority on anyone.
('98', 362, 3, 17, 755999) And it is for this reason that I am not burdened with the party responsibility.
('98', 362, 3, 18, 756079) I cherish the affection of anyone as long as I can.
('98', 362, 3, 19, 756131) Therefore, when someone hurts you, it is like hurting me.
('98', 362, 3, 20, 756189) My colleague is also your colleague.
('98', 362, 3, 21, 756226) Should we not share his difficulties?
('98', 362, 3, 22, 756264) You will find that it is very hard to become wealthy and acquire somebody’s love at the same time.
('98', 362, 3, 23, 756363) Moreover, man bows before money.
('98', 362, 3, 24, 756396) At the same time, he does not wish to bow.
('98', 362, 3, 25, 756439) That is why a man who thinks himself independent often crosses the limit.
('98', 362, 3, 26, 756513) For such subtle reasons only I abandoned money.
('98', 362, 3, 27, 756561) Money is the cause of envy.
('98', 362, 3, 28, 756589) How can you be free of it?
('98', 362, 3, 29, 756616) You are modest.
('98', 362, 3, 30, 756632) You are wise.
('98', 362, 3, 31, 756646) Therefore, you must bear with impudence in others.
('98', 362, 3, 32, 756697) You do not hurt me.
('98', 362, 3, 33, 756717) But I am certainly pained when you are hurt.
('98', 362, 3, 34, 756762) If you wish to free me from pain, you tell me whatever you want but do not be unhappy yourself.
('98', 362, 3, 35, 756858) I shall not worry then but I shall be free from fear if you are not feeling hurt.
('98', 362, 3, 36, 756940) You have got to get over your nervousness.
('98', 362, 3, 37, 756983) You must drive it out in time.
('98', 362, 3, 38, 757014) Do come here when you have calmed down or, if you are perturbed, to attain peace.

('98', 364, 3, 4, 758638) DEAR SHANKERLAL, Sister told me about the censorious remarks.
('98', 364, 3, 5, 758700) Censure is nothing new to you.
('98', 364, 3, 6, 758731) It would be cowardice on your part to leave Ahmedabad or sister’s house from fear of criticism.
('98', 364, 3, 7, 758827) There is not the slightest reason to do such a thing.
('98', 364, 3, 8, 758881) Who would ever take note of such criticism?
('98', 364, 3, 9, 758925) What is so surprising about people talking?

('98', 364, 3, 11, 759041) It is even more so in the case of those who want to do service.
('98', 364, 3, 12, 759105) It is necessary that you should come to Ahmedabad and be of service to the mill workers and others.
('98', 364, 3, 13, 759205) Before that, you should stay at the Ashram and acquire mental peace.
('98', 364, 3, 14, 759274) You may certainly not leave Ahmedabad.
('98', 364, 3, 15, 759313) I keep getting dried fruit.
('98', 364, 3, 16, 759341) It will be all right if you send it every eight days instead of every four.

('98', 365, 3, 5, 760110) Though unwittingly, I have hurt you no doubt.
('98', 365, 3, 6, 760156) Its remedy lies in fortitude.
('98', 365, 3, 7, 760186) You must contain your anger.
('98', 365, 3, 8, 760215) Anandanand is not so bad as you seem to think.
('98', 365, 3, 9, 760262) But even if he is bad, you cannot abandon him altogether as long as he continues to be my colleague.
('98', 365, 3, 10, 760363) You must agree to this much.
('98', 365, 3, 11, 760392) You can be modest because you have that power.

('98', 365, 8, 22, 760903) Whenever anyone challenges you, give courteous replies.
('98', 365, 8, 23, 760959) If you are patient, everything will settle down.
('98', 365, 8, 24, 761008) There are two ways of containing the situation.
('98', 365, 8, 25, 761056) One is that truth should compromise with untruth.
('98', 365, 8, 26, 761106) This way is wrong.
('98', 365, 8, 27, 761125) When truth remains firm on its path, untruth, being illusory, disappears like the water of the mirage.
('98', 365, 8, 28, 761228) I have seen it happen innumerable times.
('98', 365, 8, 29, 761269) I do not always argue with you like this because you can grasp the true situation at once.
('98', 365, 8, 30, 761360) But I am writing this letter to reassure myself.
('98', 365, 8, 31, 761409) That is why I have started explaining the situation.

('98', 366, 2, 5, 761695) This is because I have caused you pain.
('98', 366, 2, 6, 761735) Now I know in what way you can be pacified.
('98', 366, 2, 7, 761779) I should have exercised patience and avoided intruding in your territory and should have just watched the developments.
('98', 366, 2, 8, 761899) I shall try to correct your mistake on my return.

('98', 366, 6, 14, 762120) SHANKERLAL, Bhai Jethalal has asked for Rs. 2000 for the purchase of cotton.
('98', 366, 6, 15, 762197) If something remains from it, give him even one thousand if he wants.
('98', 366, 6, 16, 762267) I have read Bhai Ratilal’s letter.
('98', 366, 6, 17, 762302) If he gives a satisfactory reply to your question regarding the one anna grant, there may be no objection to giving it for a year.
('98', 366, 6, 18, 762433) I have a little doubt because Ratibhai himself does not seem confident that people would store cotton with proper understanding or spin it.
('98', 366, 6, 19, 762573) It seems from his letter that those who had been spinning at one time have stopped doing so.
('98', 366, 6, 20, 762666) How long would the people who need to be tempted persist?
('98', 366, 6, 21, 762724) My attitude at present is to definitely do what can be done with absolute purity.
('98', 366, 6, 22, 762806) We should not be satisfied if after being provided implements worth five to seven rupees, people turn out work worth two or three rupees.
('98', 366, 6, 23, 762944) If a person who has been given implements worth five rupees does the work worth about Rs. 100 every year, then those implements would acquire glory.
('98', 366, 6, 24, 763093) But the person doing work worth Rs. 100 must repay Rs. 5 that very year.
('98', 366, 6, 25, 763166) I have noted about the book about weaving.
('98', 366, 6, 26, 763209) 1 You must have received .

('98', 369, 12, 21, 766878) If I really became an emperor, I would not have the same thoughts I am having now because of intoxication of power.
('98', 369, 12, 22, 766994) I perfectly agree with your view that this is quite possible.
('98', 369, 12, 23, 767056) That is exactly why I like the work of a sweeper, spinner, weaver.

('98', 370, 6, 9, 767876) Even after that, if we do not succeed, the blame should lie with God.
('98', 370, 6, 10, 767946) When we do not ask from Him the reward of our good deeds, should He punish us for our unavoidable shortcomings?

('98', 371, 4, 13, 769405) What then to talk about arati?
('98', 371, 4, 14, 769436) I do not even know that the Maharashtrian ladies had done the arati.
('98', 371, 4, 15, 769505) I only thought they were blessing me as a sister would bless her brother on his birthday.
('98', 371, 4, 16, 769595) But if the ladies had gathered for doing the arati, it was sinful on their part.
('98', 371, 4, 17, 769676) I did not accept the arati with that view.
('98', 371, 4, 18, 769719) But even the coconut irks me.
('98', 371, 4, 19, 769749) Anyone prostrating before me also irritates me.
('98', 371, 4, 20, 769797) I do not wish any obeisance done to me.
('98', 371, 4, 21, 769837) This is the truth of my soul.
('98', 371, 4, 22, 769867) But being close to me, perhaps you asked them to do so?
('98', 371, 4, 23, 769923) Do I have to explain all this to you?
('98', 371, 4, 24, 769961) If you have not understood that, I have to accept that it is my innermost desire to get such adulation.
('98', 371, 4, 25, 770065) In that case, how can anyone be blamed if I find myself in the same situation as Caesar who desired the crown and did not get it?
('98', 371, 4, 26, 770195) I am writing all this because you did not meet me yesterday.
('98', 371, 4, 27, 770256) I received the letter only yesterday.
('98', 371, 4, 28, 770294) Mathuradas has not received the letter.
('98', 371, 4, 29, 770334) And Durga has said that you are going today and therefore I wish that you do not forget discussing the matter with him.
('98', 371, 4, 30, 770454) Now both of you should talk it over.
('98', 371, 4, 31, 770491) Ask Avantikabehn about what the Maharashtrian ladies had done.
('98', 371, 4, 32, 770554) After that inform me about whatever tangible or subtle thing you might have observed, so that I would go deeper in examining myself.
('98', 371, 4, 33, 770687) I have still to discuss one thing with him.
('98', 371, 4, 34, 770731) M. believes that you should stay only with me.
('98', 371, 4, 35, 770778) I have partially understood it.
('98', 371, 4, 36, 770810) This should also be fully understood that I do not have to write about it to you again.
('98', 371, 4, 37, 770898) I have not fully understood his purpose.
('98', 371, 4, 38, 770939) Anandanand has also stressed it.
('98', 371, 4, 39, 770972) He says that he has written to you at great length.
('98', 371, 4, 40, 771024) He is very hurt.
('98', 371, 4, 41, 771041) I wish he is convinced.
('98', 371, 4, 42, 771065) I did not know that he desired your presence for the Navajivan to that extent.
('98', 371, 4, 43, 771144) That is how I had understood you.
('98', 371, 4, 44, 771178) But if it is possible to interpret your letter in the manner of Mathuradas, then you two should first discuss the matter
('98', 372, 0, 1, 771299) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 373
('98', 372, 1, 2, 771346) and analyse me and then express your view.
('98', 372, 1, 3, 771389) This is the purpose of my writing to you now.
('98', 372, 1, 4, 771435) This again is the third point.
('98', 372, 1, 5, 771466) I do believe that then I too would have the qualities of absolute truth, non violence, brahmacharya, etc.
('98', 372, 1, 6, 771572) But surely I can take such an objective view at present?
('98', 372, 1, 7, 771629) I had no idea that the matter was already discussed between you and Mathuradas.
('98', 372, 1, 8, 771709) Why did you wirte that it was not a matter of question or complaint but that you two should discuss it together?

('98', 372, 3, 10, 771863) 401. LETTER TO VALJI G. DESAI
('98', 372, 4, 11, 771893) VALJI, Received your letter.
('98', 372, 4, 12, 771922) It is our duty to cure the crippled.
('98', 372, 4, 13, 771959) But I do not think that forcibly castrating him is our duty.
('98', 372, 4, 14, 772020) There are many ways to prevent the crippled from turning lunatic.
('98', 372, 4, 15, 772086) But these involve hard work.
('98', 372, 4, 16, 772115) With a stroke of legislation, castrating the ones that are considered crippled or making them impotent is neither a brave act nor a good effort.
('98', 372, 4, 17, 772260) It is sheer despotism.
('98', 372, 4, 18, 772283) The statistics you send me do not impress me.
('98', 372, 4, 19, 772329) We may be few but it is desirable that we are good.
('98', 372, 4, 20, 772381) Many factors like diversities of food, customs, etc., lower our birth rate.
('98', 372, 4, 21, 772457) I am not sorry about that.
('98', 372, 4, 22, 772484) My question is whether what is born is a human being or a beast.
('98', 372, 4, 23, 772549) It would be wonderful if instead of male and female, we are born as man and woman.
('98', 372, 4, 24, 772632) Are you tempting Chitre to come over there?
('98', 372, 4, 25, 772676) I am thoroughly convinced that his good lies only in remaining here.
('98', 372, 4, 26, 772745) He has decided to stay [here] many times and then again wavered.
('98', 372, 4, 27, 772810) Now he has taken a vow [to stay] for six months.
('98', 372, 4, 28, 772859) Madan Mohan’s letter is enclosed.

('98', 373, 2, 3, 773057) Ashwin Sud 9
('98', 373, 3, 4, 773070) BHAISHRI VALJI, I re read the extract you sent from Anandshankarbhai’s letter.
('98', 373, 3, 5, 773149) Based on that, I have prepared the enclosed draft.
('98', 373, 3, 6, 773200) If you like it, print it after making the necessary insertions and also give its translation in the Navajivan.
('98', 373, 3, 7, 773311) If you do not like it, send me the draft of your choce.
('98', 373, 3, 8, 773367) If there are any factual errors in my draft, correct them and make other necessary changes.
('98', 373, 3, 9, 773459) Your quotation with the heading ‘Which Is The Nobler Point’ is indeed beautiful.
('98', 373, 3, 10, 773540) But do you think no one is aware of it?
('98', 373, 3, 11, 773580) Quotations from books are appropriate when they are either incorporated in one’s own writing or when they are very good and yet unfamiliar.
('98', 373, 3, 12, 773720) I think some of the stories of Buddhadev 1 are very well known.
('98', 373, 3, 13, 773784) Even then I have kept them in reserve till today.
('98', 373, 3, 14, 773834) But when my doubt persisted, I wanted to know your intention in sending such stories.
('98', 373, 3, 15, 773920) You must be looking after your health.
('98', 373, 3, 16, 773959) You must have gathered a lot of information about leather workshop and dairies.
('98', 373, 3, 17, 774039) Is it necessary to be so stingy about paper as you are trying to be?
('98', 373, 3, 18, 774108) Even if you want to use such paper, why should there not be aesthetic sense and uniformity?
('98', 373, 3, 19, 774200) Is there any virtue in rags or in joining the rags together and showing that as artistic effort?

('98', 373, 9, 25, 774455) Herewith the preface you had asked for.
('98', 373, 9, 26, 774495) It seems to me the proper thing to hand over the money collected for the students to the Go raksha fund with the consent of the donors.
('98', 373, 9, 27, 774631) If there is no need to consult the donors or anyone else,

('98', 374, 6, 8, 774977) I have your beautiful letter.
('98', 374, 6, 9, 775007) Keep writing about starching the yarn and the new spinning wheels.
('98', 374, 6, 10, 775074) I cannot do anything about Ba from here.
('98', 374, 6, 11, 775115) Ba’s reply was absolutely correct.
('98', 374, 6, 12, 775150) None of us is small or big.
('98', 374, 6, 13, 775178) We are all volunteers.
('98', 374, 6, 14, 775201) But who could convince Mithubehn there or tell her anything?
('98', 374, 6, 15, 775262) It is right that Ba should stay wherever she can be of greatest service.
('98', 374, 6, 16, 775335) But it is Mithubehn who is holding the strings.
('98', 374, 6, 17, 775383) Make your application to her.

('98', 374, 11, 23, 775557) I have your letter and the 100 franc note.
('98', 374, 11, 24, 775600) The letter has been changed and the amount deposited with the Navajivan office.
('98', 374, 11, 25, 775680) Many temples have separate courts for men and women desiring darshan.
('98', 374, 11, 26, 775750) It is not my view that these ought to be separate.
('98', 374, 11, 27, 775801) A time will surely come when men and women will be able to pray with a clear conscience and without being disturbed by evil thoughts.
('98', 374, 11, 28, 775935) This is to be found in the western countries, where it is not known to have had any bad effects.
('98', 374, 11, 29, 776032) I find some of the pictures of Lord Krishna and the gopis very improper.
('98', 374, 11, 30, 776105) Religious education alone can put a stop to this tendency.

('98', 375, 2, 5, 776439) If you find peace, the help rendered by generous people like Mukundlalji would have served its purpose.
('98', 375, 2, 6, 776543) Be firm and get rid of the filth of many years.
('98', 375, 2, 7, 776591) Be calm.

('98', 375, 2, 10, 776650) Your task is difficult, no doubt.

('98', 375, 10, 25, 777162) JAMNDAS, You have done well to reply Dorabji 1, “I shall reply when you talk like a gentleman”.
('98', 375, 10, 26, 777258) It was also proper that you did not greet him by saying “Sahebji”, though I have my doubts about it.
('98', 375, 10, 27, 777359) Nevertheless, the sentiment behind your not greeting him was justified.
('98', 375, 10, 28, 777431) It is best to withdraw when such things are being discussed.
('98', 375, 10, 29, 777492) I have known from experience that when it is not possible to withdraw, it is best to keep quiet.
('98', 375, 10, 30, 777589) You should have kept quiet when you heard the comment in the train.
('98', 375, 10, 31, 777657) When two persons not known to us indulge in such talk between them, why should we interfere?

('98', 376, 1, 2, 777814) We should feel kindly towards such people and pity them, knowing that they are talking out of ignorance.
('98', 376, 1, 3, 777919) Even if we cannot feel genuine pity, we should certainly have no comtempt for them.
('98', 376, 1, 4, 778003) From what these people talk we should learn the lesson that we must think before finding fault with people, and remain neutral when someone not known to us is being criticized.
('98', 376, 1, 5, 778180) Dorabji talked nonsense under the influence of liquor.
('98', 376, 1, 6, 778235) As for the other two Muslims, why should they not have spoken out when they believed in it at heart?

('98', 385, 5, 10, 790547) BHAISHRI RAMNIKLAL, Now that you have recovered, do not fall ill again.
('98', 385, 5, 11, 790619) You may go to Girnar, but tell Tarabehn that we must find our Girnar and our Ganga in the Ashram, and ultimately in our own hearts.
('98', 385, 5, 12, 790751) I have seen many disgusting things happening in the caves of the Girnar.
('98', 385, 5, 13, 790824) I have seen totally immoral people living there.
('98', 385, 5, 14, 790873) I have seen the priest at Ambaji, who should be kept an at arm’s length.
('98', 385, 5, 15, 790946) If there is no peace in the mind, where can we find it?
('98', 385, 5, 16, 791002) I have not written this to stop you from undertaking the journey to the Girnar but to tell you that even after going there peace has to be sought only in one place.
('98', 385, 5, 17, 791167) There is no doubt that people find peace on visiting such places.
('98', 385, 5, 18, 791233) But for you, such sacred places can only be instrumental.
('98', 385, 5, 19, 791291) Peace can be found only within.
('98', 385, 6, 20, 791323) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] I hope to be there before the 1st of January.

('98', 385, 10, 25, 791554) You must decide on the diet yourselves by observation.

('98', 386, 1, 3, 791781) I think ultimately everyone must recognize his own body.
('98', 386, 1, 4, 791838) Even a person like me can only talk about his own experiences.
('98', 386, 1, 5, 791901) But it appears that each person’s body has certain peculiarities.
('98', 386, 1, 6, 791967) Hence only the person himself can carry out the necessary changes.
('98', 386, 1, 7, 792034) You must also give thought to three things: hipbath, sun bath and light exercise.
('98', 386, 1, 8, 792116) You must save the necessary time to recoup your health.
('98', 386, 1, 9, 792172) Tara should not be impatient.
('98', 386, 1, 10, 792202) If she can work only for four hours, she should consider it against dharma to give the fifth hour.

('98', 392, 3, 4, 799444) VASUMATI, I have received your Hindi letter too.
('98', 392, 3, 5, 799493) We have won the world if you keep good health.
('98', 392, 3, 6, 799540) Don’t strain yourself by going to the kitchen.
('98', 392, 3, 7, 799587) It will be all right if you go there at your own convenience.
('98', 392, 3, 8, 799649) Your Hindi seems to have improved.
('98', 392, 3, 9, 799684) I did not understand the first sentence.
('98', 392, 3, 10, 799725) I had asked you to write, or were you reminded of your promise to write?
('98', 392, 3, 11, 799798) Have you written this letter to keep that promise?
('98', 392, 3, 12, 799849) Your words are capable of both these interpretations.

('98', 392, 7, 17, 800025) It is all right.
('98', 392, 7, 18, 800042) Stay there only for the present and improve your health.
('98', 392, 7, 19, 800099) You are already having good company.
('98', 392, 7, 20, 800136) Hence, the only complaint can be about the absence of my letter, is it not?
('98', 392, 7, 21, 800212) I shall not leave any cause for that complaint.
('98', 392, 7, 22, 800260) Moreover, the climate would soon be cold there.
('98', 392, 7, 23, 800308) Let us see what happens when I go to Ahmedabad in July.

('98', 392, 11, 29, 800592) If you do expect, how can I cope with it?
('98', 392, 11, 30, 800634) You went there to fall ill, is it?
('98', 392, 11, 31, 800669) Now get well quickly.

('98', 393, 8, 12, 801155) You must have reached there safely.
('98', 393, 8, 13, 801191) I would be a little anxious till you settle there.
('98', 393, 8, 14, 801242) You must definitely drop me a post card every day.
('98', 393, 8, 15, 801293) What do you eat?
('98', 393, 8, 16, 801310) How are you keeping?
('98', 393, 8, 17, 801331) What are your activities?
('98', 393, 8, 18, 801357) How is your health?
('98', 393, 8, 19, 801377) You must give me all this news.

('98', 394, 6, 12, 802280) I like your resolve to adhere to whatever you have taken up.
('98', 394, 6, 13, 802341) In my opinion, a person who cannot sing, i.e.
('98', 394, 6, 14, 802387) who cannot recognize the tune, cannot play in instrument.
('98', 394, 6, 15, 802445) God alone knows how far this is right.

('98', 394, 9, 21, 802672) Could there be anything to talk?
('98', 394, 9, 22, 802705) I saw that you have not yet gone to the new room.
('98', 394, 9, 23, 802755) After realizing that I have permitted you unhesitatingly, you may continue to stay where you are.
('98', 394, 9, 24, 802853) You must make full use of the Jodani Kosh 2 while writing Gujarati.

('98', 395, 3, 4, 803180) BHAGWANJI, You have asked me why the work of the removal of untouch ability is proceeding at a slow pace.
('98', 395, 3, 5, 803286) The reason is clear.
('98', 395, 3, 6, 803307) What is not found elsewhere is found here.
('98', 395, 3, 7, 803350) Understanding and explaining the point that irreligion has taken the place of religion is bound to take time.
('98', 395, 3, 8, 803460) Moreover, it requires immense powers of penance to show that what is known as religion is irreligion.
('98', 395, 3, 9, 803562) Those who would show it unmistakably should be the embodiments of religion themselves.
('98', 395, 3, 10, 803649) None of us is that.
('98', 395, 3, 11, 803669) We are possessed with attachments and jealousies.
('98', 395, 3, 12, 803719) We are given to physicial passions.
('98', 395, 3, 13, 803755) We do not love evil men, we have no courage, no restraint.
('98', 395, 3, 14, 803814) Hence, who would take us seriously?
('98', 395, 3, 15, 803850) This requires less of intellectual power.
('98', 395, 3, 16, 803892) What is needed is spiritual strength.
('98', 395, 3, 17, 803930) If you consider other constructive works, you will clearly see the distinction I have made.
('98', 395, 3, 18, 804022) Have patience and inculcate the qualities indicated above.

('98', 395, 8, 26, 804315) Harilal will take charge.

('98', 395, 8, 28, 804351) Ask for the accounts tonight.
('98', 395, 8, 29, 804381) Jaggery and sugar arrived yesterday; weigh these items and determine the price and pay the money to Jajuji and debit the amount to the kitchen account.

('98', 396, 2, 3, 804761) BHAU, I feel that it is harmful to carry the restrictions about food very far and say that it is irreligious to take potatoes and religious to take wheat [preparations].
('98', 396, 2, 4, 804931) It is enough to decide what diet is appropriate to keep one’s body clean and healthy.
('98', 396, 2, 5, 805017) Its relation with physical brahmacharya has got to be understood.
('98', 396, 2, 6, 805083) If roti causes constipation, it should be given up for the present.
('98', 396, 2, 7, 805151) You should take milk along with vegetables and fruits.
('98', 396, 2, 8, 805206) It has been my experience that milk is digested easily if taken with vegetables.
('98', 396, 2, 9, 805287) If even milk causes hardship in passing motion, then you should subsist on fruits and leafy vegetables.
('98', 396, 2, 10, 805391) These would not cause any harm.
('98', 396, 2, 11, 805423) If necessary, you can drop me a postcard every day.

('98', 396, 6, 16, 805628) With your open hearted nature you will certainly glorify it.
('98', 396, 6, 17, 805689) You should cease to worry about anything and should take fresh air as much as you can.
('98', 396, 6, 18, 805776) Then you will not have epilepsy, etc.
('98', 396, 6, 19, 805814) Do not worry even about the responsibility you have undertaken.
('98', 396, 6, 20, 805878) If you have accepted that burden is the name of Rama, then Rama will carry that burden.
('98', 396, 6, 21, 805966) There is no rule that a semi literate cannot become the president.
('98', 396, 6, 22, 806033) The one who is liberal, who has equal love for all, who is temperate, is in every way fit to be the president.

('98', 397, 3, 6, 806384) Continue to write like that.
('98', 397, 3, 7, 806413) Many boys were caught telling lies.
('98', 397, 3, 8, 806449) Have you also been caught along with them?

('98', 397, 9, 21, 806875) We have learnt not to be scared of death and to treat birth and death alike.
('98', 397, 9, 22, 806952) He who is born, dies, and he who dies is born.

('98', 399, 11, 18, 809290) SHANTA, It will not do if you do not study.
('98', 399, 11, 19, 809334) Can one ever feel lazy about studying?
('98', 399, 11, 20, 809373) You must always study regularly even if it is little.
('98', 399, 11, 21, 809427) Maybe chillies are causing constipation.
('98', 399, 11, 22, 809468) You must take some fruit with milk and drink plenty of water.

('98', 400, 1, 2, 809868) 474. LETTER TO SHANTA S. PATEL1
('98', 400, 2, 3, 809900) To be sent to Shanta (Shankarbhai’s) without reading
('98', 400, 3, 4, 809953) SHANTA, Received your letter.
('98', 400, 3, 5, 809983) There is no harm at all in going round with any man, particularly a married man, if you regard him as your brother.
('98', 400, 3, 6, 810099) But in view of bitter experiences, and because such company is rare in our country, people condemn such a practice.
('98', 400, 3, 7, 810215) Where one has the permission from parents, there is no need to bother about public criticism.
('98', 400, 3, 8, 810309) But where a man or a woman becomes habituated to the company of the opposite sex, it is necessary to be cautious in spite of the initial innocent relationship.
('98', 400, 3, 9, 810469) It is another matter if such a relationship is naturally built up.
('98', 400, 3, 10, 810536) But it happens rarely.
('98', 400, 3, 11, 810559) The common and wonderful rule is that a woman should seek a woman’s company and a man should seek a man’s company.
('98', 400, 3, 12, 810674) Who can negate the distance that nature has created between man and woman?
('98', 400, 3, 13, 810749) Be sure that it is futile to marry out of a desire for friendship and after doing that not to have sexual relations.
('98', 400, 3, 14, 810866) It is quite possible that a man and a woman may avoid sexual relations after getting married with the desire to have such relations.
('98', 400, 3, 15, 810999) We can see that happening in the Ashram.
('98', 400, 3, 16, 811040) But where there is no desire at all for such indulgence, where is the need for marriage?
('98', 400, 3, 17, 811129) Does not marriage mean a desire to be something more than brother and sister?
('98', 400, 3, 18, 811207) That very thing is wrong.
('98', 400, 3, 19, 811233) But if you want to have a sexual relationship, do not deceive your mind.
('98', 400, 3, 20, 811306) There is nothing wrong in it.
('98', 400, 3, 21, 811336) Tell me.
('98', 400, 3, 22, 811345) Tell Shankarbhai.
('98', 400, 3, 23, 811363) Try to exercise restraint during the quarrel.
('98', 400, 3, 24, 811409) Write to me frankly.

('98', 403, 1, 2, 814058) 482. LETTER TO PYARELAL
('98', 403, 2, 3, 814082) Tuesday, 1.30 a.m.
('98', 403, 3, 4, 814101) PYARELAL, I am writing this is pencil.
('98', 403, 3, 5, 814140) You must make do with it.
('98', 403, 3, 6, 814166) I had intended to write sooner, but I have had to endure a lot of pain during the day.
('98', 403, 3, 7, 814253) For Sushila I have taken mother’s place.
('98', 403, 3, 8, 814294) As a mother becomes distraught when the daughter is out of her sight, so is it with me.
('98', 403, 3, 9, 814382) But only when I am thus moved will I be entitled to take some service from Sushila.
('98', 403, 3, 10, 814466) But Sushila is altogether disorganized.
('98', 403, 3, 11, 814506) She may be a genius.
('98', 403, 3, 12, 814527) But a genius moulds other in his own image.
('98', 403, 3, 13, 814571) He is not moulded by others.
('98', 403, 3, 14, 814600) I am trying to mould Sushila after myself.
('98', 403, 3, 15, 814643) But at times I wonder if Sushila is not wholly unaffected.
('98', 403, 3, 16, 814702) I would consider my efforts in vain if she were observing punctuality, which I am inculcating in her with so much care, only to please me.
('98', 403, 3, 17, 814841) What I am hoping is that what Sushila is learning from me will remain with her even when she is away and that it will influence mother and the rest of the family too.
('98', 403, 3, 18, 815008) Your way is of course different.
('98', 403, 3, 19, 815041) But if Sushila became genuinely strong, maybe even you would start observing rules for her sake.
('98', 403, 3, 20, 815138) I do not at all approve of your working till midnight.
('98', 403, 3, 21, 815193) It is not as if I was letting you do it because I am in need of it.
('98', 403, 3, 22, 815261) It is because I am afraid of you.
('98', 403, 3, 23, 815295) What if Pyarelal should feel hurt and throw up everything?
('98', 403, 3, 24, 815354) So I do not say anything.
('98', 403, 3, 25, 815380) But I think you are going too far in making even Sushila keep late hours.
('98', 403, 3, 26, 815454) I know that nobody else can give you the satisfaction she can give.
('98', 403, 3, 27, 815522) You can take work from her at fixed hours during the day.
('98', 403, 3, 28, 815580) I would even like it.
('98', 403, 3, 29, 815602) She can give up the night massage and work for you at night till 9.30. I see many minutes and hours of her time being wasted.
('98', 403, 3, 30, 815728) But how far can I control her?
('98', 403, 3, 31, 815759) With that thought in mind I do not interfere.
('98', 403, 3, 32, 815805) The purpose of writing this is only to know what you wish about Sushila.
('98', 403, 3, 33, 815878) I shall abide by your wish.
('98', 403, 3, 34, 815906) If you approve of what I am doing and if she follows it with interest and knowledge, I shall need all help from you.
('98', 403, 3, 35, 816023) It would be beyond me to tolerate her again going to bed at 12.15. Let me also make another demand.
('98', 403, 3, 36, 816123) After dinner, everybody should go to sleep.
('98', 403, 3, 37, 816167) And you should not work at night.
('98', 403, 3, 38, 816201) I shall be content with what you can give during the day.
('98', 404, 0, 1, 816259) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 405
('98', 404, 1, 2, 816306) Both you brother and sister should consider this carefully and inform me about your decision.
('98', 404, 1, 3, 816400) Sushila should not feel that I am putting on her more than necessary pressure so that she loses her independence.
('98', 404, 1, 4, 816514) There is certainly this much difference between mother and me.
('98', 404, 1, 5, 816577) It is Sushila’s duty to remain within the limits mother lays down.
('98', 404, 1, 6, 816644) It is not her duty to offer anything to me.
('98', 404, 1, 7, 816688) Whatever she offers, she should offer with her whole heart—nothing at all to please me.

('98', 406, 3, 4, 819229) I have sent Mahadev over there.
('98', 406, 3, 5, 819261) Do not get into a flutter, but go there.

('98', 407, 6, 9, 820429) ANASUYABEHN, If the water for the hip bath is not cooler than the body temperature, then cool it by putting some ice.
('98', 407, 6, 10, 820547) Use the special thermometer which is available for the purpose.
('98', 407, 6, 11, 820611) It is cheap.
('98', 407, 6, 12, 820624) It is fixed to a wooden frame.
('98', 407, 6, 13, 820655) The body temperature is 99∞; so it is better to have a water temperature of 98∞.
('98', 407, 6, 14, 820736) Being unaccustomed to it, you may get a shock.
('98', 407, 6, 15, 820783) In that case put the ice after you are seated in the water.
('98', 407, 6, 16, 820843) Sit as long as you like.
('98', 407, 6, 17, 820868) You can continue for half an hour, while rubbing the abdomen with a light hand.
('98', 407, 6, 18, 820948) Use the mud packs only at night.
('98', 407, 6, 19, 820981) What kind of tea do you drink?
('98', 407, 6, 20, 821012) There is no harm in it if it is of light straw colour.
('98', 407, 6, 21, 821067) Stronger than that may prove harmful.
('98', 407, 6, 22, 821105) Tea leaves should not be put directly into the water.
('98', 407, 6, 23, 821159) They should be kept in a strainer and boiling water should be poured over it.
('98', 407, 6, 24, 821237) There is no harm in taking such tea.
('98', 407, 6, 25, 821274) Lemon juice with honey in hot water will serve the purpose of tea.
('98', 407, 6, 26, 821341) The other diet seems all right.
('98', 407, 6, 27, 821373) The less starch you consume the better.
('98', 407, 6, 28, 821413) You can’t take jam, etc.
('98', 407, 6, 29, 821438) You may eat all varieties of gourds, brinjal, etc.

('98', 408, 1, 2, 821688) 493. LETTER TO ANASUYABEHN SARABHAI
('98', 408, 2, 3, 821724) Saturday
('98', 408, 3, 4, 821733) ANASUYABEHN, I have your letter.
('98', 408, 3, 5, 821766) It is possible that Vallabhbhai is at fault in his dealings with the workers.
('98', 408, 3, 6, 821844) But you cannot say for that reason there is authoritarianism in Gujarat.
('98', 408, 3, 7, 821917) I can, however, understand your anger arising from anguish.
('98', 408, 3, 8, 821977) I hear praise for Vallabhbhai in news wherever I get it from.
('98', 408, 3, 9, 822039) Sitting here I feel the same way about his work.
('98', 408, 3, 10, 822088) Man is full of faults.
('98', 408, 3, 11, 822111) Vallabhbhai may have made mistakes.
('98', 408, 3, 12, 822147) We must try and understand them.
('98', 408, 3, 13, 822180) And our dharma consists in drawing his attention if we can, to these mistakes so that he may rectify his faults.
('98', 408, 3, 14, 822293) If he does not mend himself, we should not get angry but remian patient.
('98', 408, 3, 15, 822366) So much for your general criticism.
('98', 408, 3, 16, 822402) Now about the workers.
('98', 408, 3, 17, 822425) Did you or Shankerlal meet Vallabh bhai in person?
('98', 408, 3, 18, 822476) If so, did you speak your mind freely to him?
('98', 408, 3, 19, 822522) You should not fight shy of being snubbed.
('98', 408, 3, 20, 822565) We should quarrel with Vallabhbhai if justice has to be got done.
('98', 408, 3, 21, 822631) Friendship consists in that and so does training for public life.
('98', 408, 3, 22, 822697) In public institutions, those whom we consider our opponents are sometimes really that, but often they are friends.
('98', 408, 3, 23, 822813) We should regard both kinds as equals and seek justice from them.
('98', 408, 3, 24, 822879) In the immediate present, I do not expect much from the the owners.
('98', 408, 3, 25, 822947) Our views are so divergent that they cannot be easily reconciled.
('98', 408, 3, 26, 823013) We should be content to take from them as much as we can or fight them.
('98', 408, 3, 27, 823085) What I like best is that the workers should build their own chawls.
('98', 408, 3, 28, 823153) But is that possible at present?
('98', 408, 3, 29, 823186) However, I feel that even if a small number of workers come forward to do so, we should encourage it.
('98', 408, 3, 30, 823288) If you are hesitant to write to Vallabhbhai about what you should get from him, let me know and I shall do so readily.
('98', 408, 3, 31, 823407) So far I have not written to him.
('98', 408, 3, 32, 823441) If you can manage that on your own, there will be no need for me to write.
('98', 408, 3, 33, 823516) Both of you should reflect on this and let me know.
('98', 408, 3, 34, 823568) I shall then do what I feel is proper.
('98', 408, 4, 35, 823607) [I quote] the above so that you can act upon what you believe in from among the things you read.
('98', 408, 4, 36, 823704) Ponder over it and cool down.

('98', 409, 2, 3, 823958) SEGAON, WARDHA
('98', 409, 3, 4, 823973) MRIDU, I received your letter after a long time.
('98', 409, 3, 5, 824022) I had expected you to come for the Working Committee.
('98', 409, 3, 6, 824076) When I asked Jawaharlal I learnt that you and Lakshmi Babu had not been invited this time.
('98', 409, 3, 7, 824167) You have given good information about the family.
('98', 409, 3, 8, 824217) From one point of view, Veena can be said to have made a good choice.
('98', 409, 3, 9, 824287) Your brothers and sisters would not do anything without the blessings of the elders.
('98', 409, 3, 10, 824372) All of you can get their blessings easily.
('98', 409, 3, 11, 824415) I have not seen other parents taking care of the freedom of their children.
('98', 409, 3, 12, 824491) My blessings to Veena and Madan Mohan.
('98', 409, 3, 13, 824530) You may come any time you want.
('98', 409, 3, 14, 824562) I have understood about the Muslims.
('98', 409, 3, 15, 824599) It is correct.
('98', 409, 3, 16, 824614) Your letter to the Trade Union is beautiful.
('98', 409, 3, 17, 824659) I shall think more when that work comes to me.
('98', 409, 3, 18, 824706) There is the Gujarati typewriter.
('98', 409, 3, 19, 824740) Is there [Gujarati] shorthand too?
('98', 409, 3, 20, 824775) Have you written your letter with a reed or with a new pen?
('98', 409, 3, 21, 824835) Your handwriting is thick and though appearing big, is confusing.
('98', 409, 3, 22, 824901) It cannot be called clear.
('98', 409, 3, 23, 824928) I found it difficult to read.
('98', 409, 3, 24, 824958) I am sending back one page with my scribbling.
('98', 409, 3, 25, 825005) Perhaps with that you will understand my point better.
('98', 409, 3, 26, 825060) You have still many years before you.
('98', 409, 3, 27, 825098) If you try right from now, you would write a handwriting which would be beautiful like pearls.
('98', 409, 3, 28, 825193) Do not say to yourself that this is like the pot calling the kettle black.
('98', 409, 3, 29, 825268) It is because my handwriting is bad that I at once notice the bad handwriting of others.
('98', 409, 3, 30, 825357) It is good news that mummy has got well.

('98', 410, 1, 3, 825798) It is very easy to learn carding.
('98', 410, 1, 4, 825832) You can learn the technique when you come here, or a teacher can be sent there.
('98', 410, 1, 5, 825912) The time it takes to spin is ten times longer than the time it takes to card.
('98', 410, 1, 6, 825990) It means that half an hour’s carding would suffice for ten day’s spinning.
('98', 410, 1, 7, 826065) Anyone who does not know carding can never be said to know spinning.
('98', 410, 1, 8, 826134) But in writing this I do not intend to add to your burden.
('98', 410, 1, 9, 826193) You must do only as much as you can do and what you have time to do.
('98', 410, 1, 10, 826262) I hope all you brothers and sisters are serving your mother.

('98', 410, 6, 19, 826721) Writing for you was as difficult as it was easy to write for Navajivan.
('98', 410, 6, 20, 826793) I have now written it and today I have forgotten where and how it should be sent.

('98', 412, 13, 22, 829542) One who does not observe the rules will certainly not become a part of the machine and therefore “he will perish like a scattered cloud” 2. My advice to you is that you should live in the Vidyapith the way your inner self guides you.
('98', 412, 13, 23, 829776) Find peace of mind anyhow.

('98', 413, 1, 8, 830143) The wise accept the good and leave the evil (like the swan) which drinks the milk and leaves the water behind.” Keep writing to me.

('98', 415, 9, 15, 832627) In some respect that is true of me also.
('98', 415, 9, 16, 832668) It seems I shall never give up my assinine nature.

('98', 415, 9, 21, 832942) Your letter has not been given a simple meaning.

('98', 415, 9, 25, 833137) The wrong will be righted if you can laugh over it, learn a lesson from it and get everyone to laugh over it.

('98', 419, 17, 23, 838416) 9. The instinctive qualities attributed to the soul are the gunas of the individual.
('98', 419, 17, 24, 838501) He who possesses the quality of maximum calm is sattvika or righteous.
('98', 419, 17, 25, 838572) He who possesses the quality of maximum disquiet is rajasi or passionate.
('98', 419, 17, 26, 838646) And he who lacks in both these qualities and is also wanting in awareness or knowledge is tamasi, which signifies darkness and ignorance.
('98', 419, 17, 27, 838784) 10. Every wise person must possess the same qualities.
('98', 419, 17, 28, 838839) He may appear to be impractical, but in reality, he is not so.
('98', 419, 17, 29, 838902) 11. Ba is still so stupid that she does not understand even common duty.
('98', 419, 17, 30, 838975) It pained me.
('98', 419, 17, 31, 838989) There was only pity behind it.
('98', 419, 17, 32, 839020) 12. The body can certainly reach the state of absolute brahmacharya and absolute truth.
('98', 419, 17, 33, 839108) There can be no freedom from unavoidable violence like breathing.
('98', 419, 17, 34, 839174) 13. That a passionless, perfect man should commit a blunder is a contradiction in terms like a son being born to a barren woman.

('98', 420, 1, 5, 839648) 15. A person who has controlled the senses ultimately becomes incapable of sensual pleasures.
('98', 420, 1, 6, 839742) But that is the capacity of the strong.
('98', 420, 1, 7, 839782) 16. With growing compassion, there is greater calm, because then one is experiencing pain.
('98', 420, 1, 8, 839873) It is the calm resulting from a sense of duty.
('98', 420, 1, 9, 839920) Hence, a saintly man experiences calm in the midst of disquiet.
('98', 420, 1, 10, 839984) 17. Truth means existing at all times.
('98', 420, 1, 11, 840023) That passionless state pertains to Brahman.
('98', 420, 1, 12, 840067) Hence it is that Truth is Brahman.
('98', 420, 1, 13, 840102) 18. Self introspection means constant awareness about the existence of soul, etc.
('98', 420, 1, 14, 840184) 19. Being omniscient means having complete knowledge of soul.
('98', 420, 1, 15, 840246) Liberation means absolute detachment with regard to worldly existence.
('98', 420, 1, 16, 840317) Equanimity means being unconcerned about pleasure and pain, non possession, neutrality, being and non being, a state of nothingness, liberation.

('98', 420, 1, 18, 840510) All prevailing everywhere in totality.
('98', 420, 1, 19, 840549) Doer: One who does.
('98', 420, 1, 20, 840569) A cobbler is not the doer of shoes.
('98', 420, 1, 21, 840605) Equanimous: fair minded.
('98', 420, 1, 22, 840630) 21. Some other time.

('98', 420, 1, 29, 841001) Renouncing the world for the sake of the soul.
('98', 420, 1, 30, 841048) Even while interpreting to simply mean that we should renounce the world for moksha, it means that the world should be renounced even for the sake of the protection of the body.
('98', 420, 1, 31, 841226) The soul is very often said to mean both the body and the physical.
('98', 420, 1, 32, 841294) Where its meaning as the body creates a wrong impression, it should be taken to mean the physical.

('98', 421, 6, 8, 841856) KASHINATH,
('98', 421, 7, 9, 841867) I do not understand how I forgot about writing a letter to Kalavati.
('98', 421, 7, 10, 841936) It is possible that since I had wanted to write, I must have taken it for granted that I had written it, and in fact it must have remained unwritten.
('98', 421, 7, 11, 842086) I do not think the letter to Shanta still remains to be written.
('98', 421, 7, 12, 842151) Still I am writing.
('98', 421, 7, 13, 842171) I am also writing to Kalavati today.
('98', 421, 7, 14, 842208) The one who has become aware of his soul does do karma but does not think that the burden lies on him.
('98', 421, 7, 15, 842311) He should never feel that way.
('98', 421, 7, 16, 842342) A person sold into slavery does everything, yet keeps no responsibility on his head.

('98', 421, 7, 18, 842491) Give consolation to Nathmalji on my behalf.
('98', 421, 7, 19, 842535) I feel like describing the process of going to the place, where everyone has to go, by some name other than death.

('98', 422, 10, 18, 843612) GANGABEHN, I have received both your letters.
('98', 422, 10, 19, 843658) I opened them myself and then tore them up.
('98', 422, 10, 20, 843702) It does not matter that you have wasted two postage stamps.
('98', 422, 10, 21, 843762) Write frankly whatever you want to write.
('98', 422, 10, 22, 843804) As for me, I saw in your letter itself the picture you have given of yourself.
('98', 422, 10, 23, 843883) Man can never hide himself with his own language.
('98', 422, 10, 24, 843933) The more he conceals himself, the more he reveals.
('98', 422, 10, 25, 843984) Artificiality eats up man.
('98', 422, 10, 26, 844011) I did not have any charges to make against you.
('98', 422, 10, 27, 844059) But I wrote to you because I did not feel you were simple hearted and I did not get that impression from your letter either.
('98', 422, 10, 28, 844184) The reasons for it are the same that you mention.
('98', 422, 10, 29, 844234) Having known them, they have to be removed.
('98', 422, 10, 30, 844278) It can be done with practice.
('98', 422, 10, 31, 844308) We can say we have acquired knowledge only when we can derive joy from whatever situation we may be in.
('98', 422, 10, 32, 844412) In my view, your present circumstances are favourable.
('98', 422, 10, 33, 844467) Seeking more facilities will mean being self willed.
('98', 422, 10, 34, 844520) I only wish to give you true happiness even if it means hurting you.
('98', 422, 10, 35, 844589) I am interested in your true happiness.
('98', 422, 10, 36, 844629) Rather than be agitated, you should be cheerful, welcome my

('98', 426, 8, 23, 850417) I do not understand what the trouble is about.
('98', 426, 8, 24, 850464) The old Committee should of course be renominated, and till they are released, there should be new acting members.

('98', 427, 1, 3, 850778) I do not think it is necessary to nominate me.

('98', 427, 4, 7, 850925) I like all activities connected with village industries.
('98', 427, 4, 8, 850982) But I have seen from experience that the primary objective of such exhibitions should be only to educate.
('98', 427, 4, 9, 851088) And today it is necessary to draw attention particularly to these things which would show the rural people how to make and wear their own khadi and how and what to produce by way of food.

('98', 427, 7, 14, 851418) Only once did hear it being sung by the Kabraji girls.
('98', 427, 7, 15, 851473) There is another saying: “Even mother would not serve food unless you ask”.
('98', 427, 7, 16, 851549) The third one is “Some people are so shy that they would feel hot even under the shade of a tree”.
('98', 427, 7, 17, 851648) All these three apply to you.
('98', 427, 7, 18, 851678) They applied to me also.

('98', 428, 5, 14, 852736) If either you or Sushila or both of you have the slightest desire, do stay on.

('98', 428, 8, 24, 853163) She can render some service if there is any need.
('98', 428, 8, 25, 853213) she should not do it under force.

('98', 430, 5, 9, 855996) You have put me a difficult if not awkward question.
('98', 430, 5, 10, 856049) I hold extreme views about British connection.
('98', 430, 5, 11, 856096) In spite of my love of the British people, I think that their imperialism has been their greatest crime against humanity and specially against India which has been studiously humiliated and emasculated.
('98', 430, 5, 12, 856299) The wrong is all the greater because they have turned it into a virtue of which they are proud.
('98', 430, 5, 13, 856395) The immediate thing therefore the British Government should do is to confess the wrong and undo it.
('98', 430, 5, 14, 856495) Of the undoing, there is no sign as yet visible in the Indian sky.
('98', 430, 5, 15, 856562) And yet I cannot help thinking that before Britain can claim to have moral supremacy she has to take the first step.
('98', 430, 5, 16, 856679) Then all else will follow as day follows night.
('98', 430, 5, 17, 856727) I will not make impertinent suggestions by way of practical steps.

('98', 433, 2, 6, 860648) Tooth against tooth is grammatical and can be given its ordinary meaning.

('98', 436, 3, 4, 863583) MY DEAR LOWER HOUSE, I was reading Carlyle yesturday.
('98', 436, 3, 5, 863637) I copied the accompanying 2 for you.
('98', 436, 3, 6, 863674) Is it not splendid?

('98', 436, 8, 14, 863917) It is only with renunciation that life, properly speaking, can be said to begin.
('98', 436, 8, 15, 863998) What is this that thou hast been fretting and fuming on account of?
('98', 436, 8, 16, 864066) Say in a word: Is it not because thou art not happy?
('98', 436, 8, 17, 864119) Because thee (who art a sweet gentleman) is not sufficiently honoured, nourished, soft bedded and lovingly cared for?
('98', 436, 8, 18, 864237) Foolish soul!
('98', 436, 8, 19, 864251) What Act of Legislature was there thou shouldst be happy?
('98', 436, 8, 20, 864309) A little while ago thou hadst no right to be at all.
('98', 436, 8, 21, 864362) What if thou weren’t born and predestined not to be happy, but to be unhappy?
('98', 436, 8, 22, 864440) Art thou nothing other than a vulture that flying through the universe seeking after somewhat to eat and shrieking dolefully because carrion enough is not given thee?
('98', 436, 8, 23, 864607) Man can do without anything and instead find blessedness.
('98', 436, 8, 24, 864665) Was it not to preach forth the same Higher [Truth] that sages and martyrs have spoken and suffered, bearing testimony through life and through death of the God like that is in man and how in the God like only he has strength and freedom?
('98', 436, 8, 25, 864903) Oh, thank thy destiny for afflictions.
('98', 436, 8, 26, 864942) Thankfully bear what yet remain.
('98', 436, 8, 27, 864975) Thou hadst need of them.
('98', 436, 8, 28, 865000) The self in thee needed to be annihilated.
('98', 436, 8, 29, 865043) By benignant fever paroxysms is life rooting out the deep seated chronic disease and triumphs over death.

('98', 437, 8, 11, 865912) Thursday night
('98', 437, 9, 12, 865927) DEAR MR. KALLENBACH, The Upper House was delighted to receive a note from the Lower House, but the Upper House strongly resents and protests against the insult implied in the titles used by the Lower House in addressing the Upper House.
('98', 437, 9, 13, 866164) If the Lower House persists in such disrespectful and inappropriate language, all the liberty granted by the Constitution to the Lower House will be withdrawn and the Lower House will be called upon to return to Phoenix at once and before Tuesday in order to give a good account to the Lower House’s doings.
('98', 437, 9, 14, 866472) ‘Master me no Master’ says the Upper House.
('98', 437, 9, 15, 866516) Whether the Upper House can fairly enjoy the privilege of the friendship of the Lower is a question to be jointly determined after due deliberation by both the Houses.
('98', 437, 9, 16, 866684) In the meanwhile, the Upper House must undergo a period of probation before claiming the high title of a true friend.
('98', 437, 9, 17, 866802) The time table is good, but how can you think of remaining there the whole of the other week when the progress is spelt retrogression!
('98', 437, 9, 18, 866937) From good to medium and from medium to bad is a startling thing.
('98', 437, 9, 19, 867002) I really, therefore, think that it will be as well to pass next week at Phoenix.
('98', 437, 9, 20, 867083) There is not much chance of my going there during the week.
('98', 437, 9, 21, 867143) There is much to do and see at Phoenix and if necessary you can pay a visit to Durban in the meanwhile, returning

('98', 438, 1, 2, 867304) here for the night.
('98', 438, 1, 3, 867324) However, if you think that Durban is giving you mental peace and progress, by all means stay there.
('98', 438, 1, 4, 867424) You need not fear t he food here now because it is most like what we have at Orchards.
('98', 438, 2, 5, 867511) Yours sincerely, M.K. GANDHI [PS.] What about Dickson’s advice?

('98', 438, 6, 10, 867806) Here is my bill of fare.

('98', 438, 6, 16, 867945) lemon 1 d.
('98', 438, 7, 17, 867956) My second meal is also of the same style.
('98', 438, 7, 18, 867998) Monkey nuts I use in the shape of butter.
('98', 438, 7, 19, 868040) My meal takes me no more than 20 minutes.
('98', 438, 7, 20, 868082) Whether it is the oil or monkey nuts or both I am feeling much stronger.
('98', 438, 7, 21, 868155) Here is my day’s work.
('98', 438, 7, 22, 868178) To get up with the boys 4.45 a.m.
('98', 438, 7, 23, 868212) Garden works 5 a.m.
('98', 438, 7, 24, 868232) to 7 a.m.
('98', 438, 7, 25, 868242) with the boys.
('98', 438, 7, 26, 868257) I work a little after that.
('98', 438, 7, 27, 868285) The boys have their bath and breakfast between 7 and 8. I attend to the patients during the time.
('98', 438, 7, 28, 868383) From 8 to 11 the boys do their lessons which I take and set between 8 and 9. From 9 to 11, I work at the press, 11 to 12 meal time, 12 to 4.30 press work, attending patients, etc., 4.45 to 5.45 gardening with the boys.
('98', 438, 7, 29, 868602) Dinner 6 to 7 p.m.
('98', 438, 7, 30, 868621) More lessons with the boys, who retire at 8.30 p.m.
('98', 438, 7, 31, 868673) I receive visitors and try to retire at 10 p.m.
('98', 439, 0, 1, 868721) 440 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 439, 1, 2, 868763) If you were here I could certainly profit by your knowledge of gardening.
('98', 439, 1, 3, 868837) I am discussing with the press people as to the gardening and the proposal is that all but Kababhai should give 4 hours togardening every day.
('98', 439, 1, 4, 868980) If we can but carry out the programme, what a glorious thing it would be!
('98', 439, 1, 5, 869054) We propose to do joint cultivation on Cordes’ ground as it is fenced and put in there fruit trees which would give a return enough to support at least a few.
('98', 439, 1, 6, 869212) There are two Kaffir boys working at the press.
('98', 439, 1, 7, 869260) I am suggesting that we should use them mostly for field work.
('98', 439, 1, 8, 869323) Reverting to the food question, I see that I could easily live on the products of Phoenix, barring oil.
('98', 439, 1, 9, 869427) All fruit just now is very dear.
('98', 439, 1, 10, 869460) Otherwise I should live on 8 d.
('98', 439, 1, 11, 869492) per day and not 1/3 as now.
('98', 439, 1, 12, 869520) per day would be exactly £1 per month.
('98', 439, 1, 13, 869559) I often substitute lemons by raw mangoes which are soaked in olive oil.
('98', 439, 1, 14, 869631) Mangoes are home grown ≈ not so lemons just now.
('98', 439, 1, 15, 869680) I am writing this amid many interruptions.
('98', 439, 1, 16, 869723) So I shall close with love.
('98', 439, 1, 17, 869751) Will you please read this to Mr. Kotwal and others so that they may understand the progress of my experiment.

('98', 440, 3, 9, 870707) The whole affair is shocking.
('98', 440, 3, 10, 870737) The article on the Protector is West’s.
('98', 440, 3, 11, 870777) He has been corresponding with the Campbell.
('98', 440, 3, 12, 870822) I am asking West to send you copies.
('98', 440, 3, 13, 870859) You will carefully read the Gold Law case.
('98', 440, 3, 14, 870902) It is a great victory.
('98', 440, 3, 15, 870925) But the fight will have to go on.

('98', 440, 3, 19, 871138) Royal Commission on Immigration into the Dominions, it might be necessary postpone the introduction of the Bill until after the report of the Commission.
('98', 440, 3, 20, 871292) I told Smuts that even then he should fulfil his promise and do so by amending the Transvaal legislation only.
('98', 440, 3, 21, 871403) He then suggested that I should send him draft Bill which I shall do.
('98', 440, 3, 22, 871473) The talk was very cordial.
('98', 440, 4, 23, 871500) Yours, BHAI

('98', 440, 8, 27, 871632) MY DEAR MILLIE, I cannot undertake to answer your prose poem.
('98', 440, 8, 28, 871694) You have at times flights which baffle me.
('98', 440, 8, 29, 871737) I shall not comment.
('98', 440, 8, 30, 871758) Let our hearts speak to each other.
('98', 440, 8, 31, 871794) Bapu has become the conventional name and that may remain without the signification attached to it.
('98', 440, 8, 32, 871894) We are and must remain brother and sister, always confiding, always trusting, always loving and helping, but neither entirely leaning on the other.
('98', 440, 8, 33, 872042) We have kept the fast splendidly.
('98', 440, 8, 34, 872076) I do not feel it at all.
('98', 440, 8, 35, 872101) All the boys and Chhaganlal’s family are fasting today.

('98', 441, 1, 3, 872264) Miss Bush came in today.
('98', 441, 1, 4, 872289) She will go away on Friday.
('98', 441, 1, 5, 872317) You should try to come before then if you can.
('98', 441, 1, 6, 872364) I hope you received my letter.
('98', 441, 1, 7, 872395) Suliman and that you were able to get Mr. Laughton to fix the matter up.

('98', 441, 4, 12, 872576) 578. LETTER TO A.H. WEST
('98', 441, 5, 13, 872601) Monday night
('98', 441, 6, 14, 872614) MY DEAR WEST, The Obligadu matter is a dastardly affair.
('98', 441, 6, 15, 872671) The Protector should be asked not to sanction the contract.
('98', 441, 6, 16, 872731) I was going to write but I suppose the mischief is done.
('98', 441, 6, 17, 872788) But certainly a letter should be written to the police inquiring why the friend was prevented and then a letter may go to the Minister of Justice.
('98', 441, 6, 18, 872935) The Protector should also be written to.
('98', 441, 6, 19, 872976) Could not someone still see Obligadu and get from him a clear statement?
('98', 441, 6, 20, 873049) Why has he signed the contract?
('98', 441, 6, 21, 873081) Who was present?
('98', 441, 6, 22, 873098) Who interpreted?
('98', 441, 6, 23, 873115) You will make sure of course of your facts in the report.
('98', 441, 6, 24, 873173) You know all about the Immigration Bill now.
('98', 441, 6, 25, 873218) The Council’s reply is very clever.
('98', 441, 6, 26, 873254) The Council has bluffed poor Joseph and he can do nothing.
('98', 441, 6, 27, 873313) Its reply regarding licences is technically correct.
('98', 441, 6, 28, 873366) It is no use writing a leader on it.
('98', 441, 6, 29, 873403) That is to say we could not give an effective leader.
('98', 441, 6, 30, 873457) If the deputation were plucky men, they could send an effective reply and challenge the Council on some of the matters.
('98', 441, 6, 31, 873577) On this side of course, you will understand that I am still in telegraphic communication with General Smuts on the Bill.
('98', 441, 6, 32, 873698) If his reply is not satisfactory, the campaign will reopen, ≈ we are all quite ready here.
('98', 441, 6, 33, 873789) I will not now worry about the Dundee licensing leadrette.
('98', 441, 7, 34, 873848) Yours, M.K.G.

('98', 442, 4, 6, 874069) Thursday night
('98', 442, 5, 7, 874084) MY DEAR WEST, So we are in trouble again.
('98', 442, 5, 8, 874126) I cannot however think otherwise than that the notice is impertinent.
('98', 442, 5, 9, 874196) If the name of the magistrate was not given and if only the Umlazi magistrate was mentioned, I do not think that the man has any cause of action.
('98', 442, 5, 10, 874342) I hope none of you has got alarmed over the matter.
('98', 442, 5, 11, 874394) I hope too that the Congressmen do not blame you in the matter.
('98', 442, 5, 12, 874458) The magistrate is evidently in a hurry to get rich.
('98', 442, 5, 13, 874510) I have absolute faith in your keeping cool and doing the right thing.
('98', 442, 5, 14, 874580) But such cases show how careful we have to be in using names.
('98', 442, 5, 15, 874642) We must simply take our time in finding out full facts.
('98', 442, 5, 16, 874698) And note that we are responsible even when we copy from other newspapers.
('98', 442, 5, 17, 874772) Whenever therefore any matter reflecting upon particular persons occurs, we should make sure of our facts.
('98', 442, 6, 18, 874879) Yours sincerely, M.K. GANDHI

('98', 443, 2, 3, 875226) I am returning the letter which you have sent to me by mistake.
('98', 443, 2, 4, 875290) Write to Chhaganlal to send the book on man and woman directly to Narandas from England.
('98', 443, 2, 5, 875379) That is the easiest way.
('98', 443, 2, 6, 875404) But if you feel it very necessary, send the one after Mr. West has read it.
('98', 443, 2, 7, 875480) However, if there is [a possibility of] delay, it would be better to send it from England.
('98', 443, 2, 8, 875571) Your activities will gradually become purer because that is what you desire.
('98', 443, 2, 9, 875648) Bear it in mind that there is no reward for true love.
('98', 443, 2, 10, 875703) It is good that you have arranged to sleep separately.
('98', 443, 2, 11, 875758) Keep it up.
('98', 443, 2, 12, 875770) You have done right in eschewing salt.

('98', 443, 7, 19, 876038) I have written to him.
('98', 443, 7, 20, 876061) We are not going to publish anything about Mangalanand Puri.
('98', 443, 7, 21, 876122) There is no harm if there is an indirect reference to him.
('98', 443, 7, 22, 876181) We have to be non committal about him.
('98', 443, 7, 23, 876220) One of his letters is worth reading.
('98', 443, 7, 24, 876257) I am sending it to you.

('98', 445, 5, 8, 878572) This is his charge against you.
('98', 445, 5, 9, 878604) You were sent as a representative of the Provincial [Congress] Committee, but instead of regarding yourself as a representative, you started working independently on your own.
('98', 445, 5, 10, 878780) He does not know how much you collected, has no account of it; in fact he knows nothing.
('98', 445, 5, 11, 878869) If all behave in this manner, how can the nation’s work go on?
('98', 445, 5, 12, 878932) A great many people in Kathiawad have worked in this manner.
('98', 445, 5, 13, 878993) Vallabhbhai, therefore, has lost some of his enthusiasm.
('98', 445, 5, 14, 879050) I place this argument before you exactly as Vallabhbhai advanced it.
('98', 445, 5, 15, 879119) Send me a detailed reply to this.
('98', 445, 5, 16, 879153) This letter will be posted in Delhi.
('98', 445, 5, 17, 879190) I will return to Ahmedabad on Saturday at the latest.

('98', 446, 7, 11, 880025) NARANDAS, I hope the atmosphere there will have improved by now, but even if it has worsened, you need not worry over it.
('98', 446, 7, 12, 880147) When a river is flooded, its water is muddier than at any other time, but when the flood has subsided, it becomes clearer than it was before.
('98', 446, 7, 13, 880289) You need not lose courage.
('98', 446, 7, 14, 880316) Express your own views freely.
('98', 446, 7, 15, 880347) When an occasion arrives, invite someone.

('98', 446, 7, 17, 880427) Invite Kaka once a fortnight.
('98', 446, 7, 18, 880457) It is desirable that you should come into more intimate contact with him.
('98', 446, 7, 19, 880531) You should not undervalue his knowledge.
('98', 446, 7, 20, 880572) Believe it for certainty that his heart is straightforward, the mind is pure and he is striving to make it purer still.
('98', 446, 7, 21, 880692) But the mind is not strong because he woke up rather late.
('98', 446, 7, 22, 880751) He cannot immediately put into practice what he wants to and feels unhappy on not being able to do so.
('98', 446, 7, 23, 880854) However, even in this respect, he has made good progress.
('98', 446, 7, 24, 880912) He has respect for you and recognizes your worth.
('98', 446, 7, 25, 880962) It is 8.45 p.m.

('98', 447, 1, 4, 881415) Do you get any letters from her?
('98', 447, 1, 5, 881448) Enclosed is a letter from Mr. Needu.
('98', 447, 1, 6, 881485) I have replied to him to the effect that if he comes over to stay in the Ashram, we will pay him Rs. 33 per month for his parents with free meals in the Ashram.

('98', 447, 5, 11, 881763) NARANDAS, If the Ashram’s car is used for Shashi and the charge for its use comes to sixty rupees, it would be better to hire a car from outside for the same sum.
('98', 447, 5, 12, 881926) If Champa’s sister, Nimu, comes and lives in the Sharda Mandir and Shashi becomes friendly with her, it seems to me that then it would be good if Nimu too lives there.
('98', 447, 5, 13, 882094) Lilavati was extremely keen on staying on, but when I explained to her that she could not do so without your permission, she came round.
('98', 447, 5, 14, 882231) She is still very agitated.
('98', 447, 5, 15, 882259) It will take some time before she calms down.

('98', 447, 9, 19, 882403) NIMU Even if all the people there oppose your new diet, you should politely disregard the opposition and stick to it provided, that is, you have faith in it and feel that it benefits you.
('98', 447, 9, 20, 882591) How did you come to think of Wardha?
('98', 447, 9, 21, 882628) You do know, do you not, that there are not many women there.
('98', 447, 9, 22, 882690) You should learn to open out your heart when writing to me.

('98', 448, 2, 3, 882951) Phagun Sud 11, Tuesday
('98', 448, 3, 4, 882974) PRABHUDAS,1 I have your letter.
('98', 448, 3, 5, 883006) If you do not find it strenuous, make it a rule to write at least once a week.
('98', 448, 3, 6, 883085) You have asked four questions but all of them seem to originate from one issue and that has arisen either due to misunderstanding or loss of memory.
('98', 448, 3, 7, 883234) I have not commented on your reading Tulsidas, Akho, etc., but you had expressed a desire to learn geology also, and that I had criticized a little.
('98', 448, 3, 8, 883383) I regard it as superficial knowledge.
('98', 448, 3, 9, 883421) It is not that this desire is base.
('98', 448, 3, 10, 883457) The only thing is that even if a person strives to imbibe such knowledge, he will gain very little.
('98', 448, 3, 11, 883557) My intention was only to say that one should be satisfied with what he easily gets.
('98', 448, 3, 12, 883641) Reading from Tulsidas cannot be considered pursuit of superficial knowledge.
('98', 448, 3, 13, 883718) It is only an external means of gaining knowledge of the self.
('98', 448, 3, 14, 883781) But study of geology, etc., is superficial knowledge.
('98', 448, 3, 15, 883835) It is a different thing if it helps someone in acquiring knowledge of the self.
('98', 448, 3, 16, 883915) I did not want to go so deep into the subject, nor did I want you to do that.
('98', 448, 3, 17, 883993) In youth, everyone feels like gaining knowledge of such science.
('98', 448, 3, 18, 884058) That’s justified too.
('98', 448, 3, 19, 884080) The intention of my criticism was to reduce the intensity of such desire.
('98', 448, 3, 20, 884154) However, I will not have any objection if you can easily find a person who has a thorough knowledge of geology and from whom you can easily learn.
('98', 448, 3, 21, 884301) I will not consider such knowledge useless.
('98', 448, 3, 22, 884345) One who has given his heart to God will use even that knowledge in praise of Him.
('98', 448, 3, 23, 884427) Now, I hope I do not have to clarify the difference between true knowledge and superficial knowledge.
('98', 448, 3, 24, 884529) Should I assume from your letter that there is a slight improvement in your health?

('98', 448, 7, 28, 884721) PRABHUDAS, I have read your letter to Chi.
('98', 448, 7, 29, 884764) There is a difference between thoughts and fancies.
('98', 448, 7, 30, 884816) Man falls through fancies and becomes a prey to worrying, thoughts mature him.

('98', 449, 1, 2, 885037) is ever thinking’, ‘thinking’ means ‘worrying’.
('98', 449, 1, 3, 885085) You should give that up.
('98', 449, 1, 4, 885110) But it is essential that we use our judgement and discriminate between our good and bad tendencies.
('98', 449, 1, 5, 885210) By thinking systematically in this matter, we become mature.
('98', 449, 1, 6, 885271) You should not worry or indulge in fancies while plying the spinning wheel.
('98', 449, 1, 7, 885347) If impure thoughts forcibly invade your mind, you should, with equal energy, force yourself to think differently.
('98', 449, 1, 8, 885461) He who is devoted to his work, has no time to indulge in useless thoughts.
('98', 449, 1, 9, 885536) Always remember that there is One Witness to all our thoughts.
('98', 449, 1, 10, 885599) How can we entertain impure thoughts in the presence of that Witness?
('98', 449, 1, 11, 885669) Take this to be the meaning of the verse, ‘It ceases when the Supreme is seen’.
('98', 449, 1, 12, 885749) Who, after seeing the Supreme, can take pleasure in the objects of the senses?
('98', 449, 1, 13, 885828) We do not know the atman.
('98', 449, 1, 14, 885854) That is why we commit sins everyday.
('98', 449, 1, 15, 885891) If we but know that He sees our thoughts also, then, just as we are ashamed to commit any sin in the presence of our dearest friend, we would, if we are definitely convinced that our atman always stands there as a witness, be ashamed of thinking impure thoughts or doing impure things.
('98', 449, 1, 16, 886177) How, then, can hypocrisy remain in us?
('98', 449, 1, 17, 886216) Lakshmidas and Velanbehn are generous.
('98', 449, 1, 18, 886255) They will certainly forgive you.
('98', 449, 1, 19, 886288) But it is your atman’s forgiveness that you really need.
('98', 449, 1, 20, 886345) Once you have become pure, you will as a matter of course be forgiven.
('98', 449, 1, 21, 886416) It is not in the nature of the atman to be impure.
('98', 449, 1, 22, 886467) So, if the impurity has left you, it has left you for good.
('98', 449, 1, 23, 886527) When even the worst of sinners becomes clean, he can stand on a footing of equality with one who has committed no sin at any time.
('98', 449, 1, 24, 886658) There is no distinction of high and low in the state of moksha 1. When that one indescribable state is attained, it is the same for all.
('98', 449, 1, 25, 886795) All of us commit sins.
('98', 449, 1, 26, 886818) But manliness lies in seeing and recognizing them and then destroying them.
('98', 449, 1, 27, 886894) You committed sins.
('98', 449, 1, 28, 886914) But you need not feel frightened for that reason.
('98', 449, 1, 29, 886964) If you do not desist from sins even after knowing that they are sins, then indeed you will have great reason to feel frightened.
('98', 449, 1, 30, 887093) But now you know that they were sins.
('98', 449, 1, 31, 887131) Having known that, why need you fear?
('98', 449, 1, 32, 887169) Be alert and suppress that disturbing impulse.

('98', 450, 3, 5, 887420) May you live long and succeed in realising your ambitions.
('98', 450, 3, 6, 887479) I consider plying of the spinning wheel the best activity if it does not affect your health.
('98', 450, 3, 7, 887572) Whatever one does cheerfully is good for health.
('98', 450, 3, 8, 887621) It would be a big achievement if spinning wheel becomes successful.
('98', 450, 3, 9, 887689) Even if it does not succeed, I consider some such experiment on a limited scale worth doing.
('98', 450, 3, 10, 887782) I will consider it a significant change if you have understood the importance of prayer and it becomes a regular feature.
('98', 450, 3, 11, 887904) Write to me about the students whenever you wish to.
('98', 450, 3, 12, 887957) I hope to reach Madras on the 23rd.

('98', 450, 7, 24, 888485) After recovering from illness, the mind craves for food.
('98', 450, 7, 25, 888542) Do not listen to the doctors.
('98', 450, 7, 26, 888572) It is better to eat only as much as you can digest.

('98', 452, 3, 17, 891112) I learnt much from these experiences.
('98', 452, 3, 18, 891150) You ought to have taken Sumitra with you.

('98', 453, 3, 4, 891813) LETTER FROM KARL STRUVE1
('98', 453, 4, 5, 891838) After carefully studying Roy Walker’s thrilling story of your admirable work (Sword of Gold) I was satisfied that, lifelong as your struggle for non violence had been, your unlimited devotion had met with success, at least as far as India’s leaders and masses were concerned, and the fact that Britain retired from India in apparent goodwill and friendship, seemed to bear out the hope that appreciation of non violence was no longer restricted to your own country.
('98', 453, 4, 6, 892304) The first breach into the thick walls of violence seemed made, and the prospects for humanity seemed to have grown more lucid than ever.
('98', 453, 5, 7, 892441) All the more depressing were your recent confessions, as reported in the last edition of Peace News by George Davies.
('98', 453, 5, 8, 892559) It grieves me to the heart to read that you had never experienced the dark despair that is today within you.
('98', 453, 5, 9, 892668) And though it is certainly true that God does not demand success but truth and love from a man, it is a sad sight to behold mankind so deeply entangled by violence as not to yield to the vast extent of soul force and self sacrifice given by you and your few friends during a long life.
('98', 453, 6, 10, 892954) However, willingly admitting as I do that you are in a far better position to look into the heart of things than I am, I cannot believe that your heroic efforts will be lost upon mankind, that the good seed you have so untiringly sown in all your surroundings, by your words as well as by your example, should be wasted.
('98', 453, 7, 11, 893275) Be that as it may, I for one (and I am sure I speak the heart of untold millions) feel it my bounden duty to express my deepest gratitude to you for giving the whole of your life to what you felt to be the one way to salvation for mankind.

('98', 453, 12, 16, 893621) The Government of India have instructed me to transmit to you the following telegraphic communication:

('98', 454, 1, 3, 894085) Such a situation now exists between India and Pakistan owing to the aid which invaders, consisting of nationals of Pakistan and of tribesmen from the territory immediately adjoining Pakistan on the north west, are drawing from Pakistan for operations against Jammu and Kashmir, a State which has acceded to the Dominion of India and is part of India.
('98', 454, 1, 4, 894436) The circumstances of accession, the activities of the invaders which led the Government of India to take military action against them, and the assistance which the attackers have received and are still receiving from Pakistan are explained later in this memorandum.
('98', 454, 1, 5, 894702) The Government of India request the Security Council to call upon Pakistan to put an end immediately to the giving of such assistance, which is an act of aggression against India.
('98', 454, 1, 6, 894882) If Pakistan does not do so, the Government of India may be compelled, in self defence, to enter Pakistan territory, in order to take military action against the invaders.
('98', 454, 1, 7, 895053) The matter is, therefore, one of extreme urgency and calls for immediate action by the Security Council for avoiding a breach of international peace.
('98', 454, 2, 8, 895203) 2. From the middle of September 1947, the Government of India had received reports of the infiltration of armed raiders into the western parts of Jammu province of Jammu and Kashmir State; Jammu adjoins West Punjab, which is a part of the Dominion of Pakistan.
('98', 454, 2, 9, 895464) These raiders had done a great deal of damage in that area and taken possession of part of the territory of the State.
('98', 454, 2, 10, 895583) On 24th October, the Government of India heard of a major raid from the Frontier Province of the Dominion of Pakistan into the Valley of Kashmir.
('98', 454, 2, 11, 895729) Some two thousand or more fully armed and equipped men came in motor transport, crossed over to the territory of the State of Jammu and Kashmir, sacked the town of Muzaffarabad, killing many people and proceeded along the Jhelum Valley road towards Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir State.
('98', 454, 2, 12, 896035) Intermediate towns and villages were sacked and burnt, many people killed.
('98', 454, 2, 13, 896110) These raiders were stopped by Kashmir State troops near Uri, a town some fifty miles from Srinagar, for some time, but the invaders got around them and burnt the power house at Mahora, which supplied electricity to the whole of Kashmir.
('98', 454, 3, 14, 896347) 3. The position, on the morning of 26th October, was that these raiders had been held by Kashmir State troops and part of the civil population, who had been armed, at a town called Baramulla.
('98', 454, 3, 15, 896539) Beyond Baramulla there was no major obstruction up to Srinagar.
('98', 454, 3, 16, 896603) There was immediate danger of these raiders reaching Srinagar, destroying and massacring large numbers of people, both Hindus and Muslims.
('98', 454, 3, 17, 896742) The State troops were spread out all over the State and most of them were deployed along the western border of Jammu province.
('98', 454, 3, 18, 896869) They had been split up into small isolated
('98', 455, 0, 1, 896912) 456 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 455, 1, 2, 896954) groups and were incapable of offering effective resistance to the raiders.
('98', 455, 1, 3, 897029) Most of the State officials had left the threatened areas and the civil administration had ceased to function.
('98', 455, 1, 4, 897140) All that stood between Srinagar and the fate which had overtaken the places en route followed by the raiders was the determination of the inhabitants of Srinagar, of all communities, and practically without arms, to defend themselves.
('98', 455, 1, 5, 897375) At this time Srinagar had also a large population of Hindu and Sikh refugees who had fled there from West Punjab owing to communal disturbances in that area.
('98', 455, 1, 6, 897533) There was little doubt that these refugees would be massacred if the raiders reached Srinagar.
('98', 455, 2, 7, 897628) 4. Immediately after the raids into Jammu and Kashmir State commenced, approaches were informally made to the Government of India for the acceptance of the accession of the State to the Indian Dominion.
('98', 455, 2, 8, 897831) (It might be explained in parenthesis that Jammu and Kashmir form a State whose ruler, prior to the transfer of power by the United Kingdom to the Dominions of India and Pakistan, had been in treaty relations with the British Crown, which controlled its foreign relations and was responsible for its defence.
('98', 455, 2, 9, 898140) The treaty relations ceased with the transfer of power on 15th August last, and Jammu and Kashmir like other States acquired the right to accede to either Dominion.)
('98', 455, 3, 10, 898306) 5. Events moved with great rapidity, and the threat to the Valley of Kashmir became grave.
('98', 455, 3, 11, 898397) On 26th October, the Ruler of the State, His Highness Maharaja Sir Hari Singh, appealed urgently to the Government of India for military help.
('98', 455, 3, 12, 898540) He also requested that the Jammu and Kashmir State should be allowed to accede to the Indian Dominion.
('98', 455, 3, 13, 898643) An appeal for help was also simultaneously received by the Government of India from the largest popular organization in Kashmir, the National Conference, headed by Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah.
('98', 455, 3, 14, 898833) The Conference further strongly supported the request for the State’s accession to the Indian Dominion.
('98', 455, 3, 15, 898937) The Government of India were thus approached not only officially by the State authorities,but also on behalf of the people of Kashmir, both for military aid and for the accession of the State to India.
('98', 455, 4, 16, 899139) 6. The grave threat to the life and property of innocent people in the Kashmir Valley and to the security of the State of Jammu and Kashmir that had developed as a result of the invasion of the Valley demanded immediate decision by the Government of India on both the requests.
('98', 455, 4, 17, 899417) It was imperative on account of the emergency that the responsibility for the defence of Jammu and Kashmir State should be taken over by a government capable of discharging it.
('98', 455, 4, 18, 899594) But, in order to avoid any possible suggestion that India had utilized the State’s immediate peril for her own political advantage, the Government of India made it clear that once the soil of the State had been cleared of the invader and normal conditions restored, its people would be free to decide their future by the recognized democratic method of a plebiscite or referendum which, in order to ensure complete impartiality, might be held under international auspices.
('98', 456, 0, 1, 900067) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 457
('98', 456, 1, 2, 900114) 7. The Government of India felt it their duty to respond to the appeal for armed assistance because:
('98', 456, 2, 3, 900215) (1) They could not allow a neighbouring and friendly State to be compelled by force to determine either its internal affairs or its external relations;
('98', 456, 3, 4, 900367) (2) The accession of Jammu and Kashmir State to the Dominion of India made India really responsible for the defence of the State.
('98', 456, 4, 5, 900497) 8. The intervention of the Government of India resulted in saving Srinagar.
('98', 456, 4, 6, 900573) The raiders were driven back from Baramulla to Uri and are held there by Indian troops.
('98', 456, 4, 7, 900661) Nearly 19,000 raiders face the Dominion forces in this area.
('98', 456, 4, 8, 900722) Since operations in the Valley of Kashmir started, pressure by the raiders against the western and south western borders of Jammu and Kashmir State had been intensified.
('98', 456, 4, 9, 900892) Exact figures are not available.
('98', 456, 4, 10, 900925) It is understood, however, that nearly 15,000 raiders are operating against this part of the State.
('98', 456, 4, 11, 901025) State troops are besieged in certain areas.
('98', 456, 4, 12, 901069) Incursions by the raiders into the State territory, involving murder, arson, loot, and the abduction of women continue.
('98', 456, 4, 13, 901189) The booty is collected and carried over to the tribal areas to serve as an inducement to the further recruitment of tribesmen to the ranks of the raiders In addition to those actively participating in the raid, tribesmen and others, estimated at 100,000, have been collected in different places in the districts of West Punjab bordering Jammu and Kashmir State, and many of them are receiving military training under Pakistani nationals, including officers of the Pakistan Army.
('98', 456, 4, 14, 901668) They are looked after in Pakistan territory, fed, clothed, armed and otherwise equipped, and transported to the territory of Jammu and Kashmir State: with the help, direct and indirect, of Pakistani officials, both military and civil.
('98', 456, 5, 15, 901903) 9. As already stated, the raiders who entered the Kashmir Valley in October came mainly from the tribal areas to the north west of Pakistan and, in order to reach Kashmir, passed through Pakistan territory.
('98', 456, 5, 16, 902110) The raids along the south west border of the State, which had preceded the invasion of the valley proper, had actually been conducted from Pakistan territory, and Pakistan nationals had taken part in them.
('98', 456, 5, 17, 902316) This process of transmission across Pakistan territory and utilization of that territory as a base of operations against Jammu and Kashmir State continues.
('98', 456, 5, 18, 902472) Recently, military operations against the western and south western borders of the State have been intensified, and the attackers consist of nationals of Pakistan as well as tribesmen.
('98', 456, 5, 19, 902657) These invaders are armed with modern weapons, including mortars and medium machine guns, wear the battle dress of regular soldiers and, in recent engagements, have fought in regular battle formation and are using the tactics of modern warfare.
('98', 456, 5, 20, 902901) Man pack wireless sets are in regular use and even mark V mines have been employed.
('98', 456, 5, 21, 902985) For their transport the invaders have all along used motor vehicles.
('98', 456, 5, 22, 903054) They are undoubtedly being trained and to some extent led by regular officers of the
('98', 457, 0, 1, 903139) 458 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 457, 1, 2, 903181) Pakistan Army.
('98', 457, 1, 3, 903196) Their rations and other supplies are obtained from Pakistan territory.
('98', 457, 1, 4, 903267) 10. These facts point indisputably to the conclusion (a) that the invaders are allowed transit across Pakistan territory; (b) that they are allowed to use Pakistan territory as a base of operations; (c) that they include Pakistan nationals; (d) that they draw much of their military equipment, transportation, and supplies (including petrol) from Pakistan; and (e) that Pakistan officers are training, guiding, and otherwise actively helping them.
('98', 457, 2, 5, 903715) There is no source other than Pakistan from which they could obtain such quantities of modern equipment, training or guidance.
('98', 457, 2, 6, 903842) More than once, the Government of India had asked the Pakistan Government to deny to the invaders facilities which constitute an act of aggression and hostility against India, but without any response.
('98', 457, 2, 7, 904044) The last occasion on which this request was made was on 22nd December, when the Prime Minister of India handed over personally to the Prime Minister of Pakistan a letter in which the various forms of aid given by Pakistan to the invaders were briefly recounted and the Government of Pakistan were asked to put an end to such aid promptly; no reply to this letter has yet been received in spite of a telegraphic reminder sent on 26th December.
('98', 457, 3, 8, 904487) 11. It should be clear from the foregoing recital that the Government of Pakistan are unwilling to stop the assistance in material and men which the invaders are receiving from Pakistan territory and from Pakistan nationals, including Pakistan Government personnel, both military and civil.
('98', 457, 3, 9, 904778) This attitude is not only un neutral, but constitutes active aggression against India, of which the State of Jammu and Kashmir forms a part.
('98', 457, 4, 10, 904919) 12. The Government of India have exerted persuasion and exercised patience to bring about a change in the attitude of Pakistan.
('98', 457, 4, 11, 905047) But they have failed, and are in consequence confronted with a situation in which their defence of Jammu and Kashmir State is hampered and their measures to drive the invaders from the territory of the State are greatly impeded by the support which the raiders derive from Pakistan.
('98', 457, 4, 12, 905330) The invaders are still on the soil of Jammu and Kashmir and the inhabitants of the State are exposed to all the atrocities of which a barbarous foe is capable.
('98', 457, 4, 13, 905490) The presence, in large numbers, of invaders in those portions of Pakistan territory which adjoin parts of Indian territory other than Jammu and Kashmir State is a menace to the rest of India.
('98', 457, 4, 14, 905682) Indefinite continuance of the present operations prolongs the agony of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, is a drain on India’s resources and a constant threat to the maintenance of peace between India and Pakistan.
('98', 457, 4, 15, 905896) The Government of India have no option, therefore, but to take more effective military action in order to rid Jammu and Kashmir State of the invader.
('98', 458, 0, 1, 906046) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 459
('98', 458, 1, 2, 906093) 13. In order that the objective of expelling the invader from Indian territory and preventing him from launching fresh attacks should be quickly achieved, Indian troops would have to enter Pakistan territory; only thus could the invader be denied the use of bases and cut off from his sources of supplies and reinforcements in Pakistan.
('98', 458, 1, 3, 906430) Since the aid which the invaders are receiving from Pakistan is an act of aggression against India, the Government of India are entitled, under international law, to send their armed forces across Pakistan territory for dealing effectively with the invaders.
('98', 458, 1, 4, 906689) However, as such action might involve armed conflict with Pakistan, the Government of India, ever anxious to proceed according to the principles and aims of the Charter of the United Nations, desire to report the situation to the Security Council under Article 35 of the Charter.
('98', 458, 1, 5, 906969) They feel justified in requesting the Security Council to ask the Government of Pakistan:
('98', 458, 2, 6, 907059) (1) to prevent Pakistan Government personnel, military and civil, from participating or assisting in the invasion of Jammu and Kashmir State;
('98', 458, 3, 7, 907201) (2) to call upon other Pakistani nationals to desist from taking any part in the fighting in Jammu and Kashmir State;
('98', 458, 4, 8, 907319) (3) to deny to the invaders: (a) access to any use of its territory for operations against Kashmir, (b) military and other supplies,(c) all other kinds of aid that might tend to prolong the present struggle.
('98', 458, 5, 9, 907527) 14. The Government of India would stress the special urgency of the Security Council taking immediate action on their request.
('98', 458, 5, 10, 907654) They desire to add that military operations in the invaded area have, in the past few days, been developing so rapidly that they must, in self defence, reserve to themselves the freedom to take, at any time when it may become necessary, such military action as they may consider the situation requires.
('98', 458, 6, 11, 907957) 15. The Government of India deeply regret that a serious crisis should have been reached in their relations with Pakistan.
('98', 458, 6, 12, 908080) Not only is Pakistan a neighbour but, in spite of the recent separation, India and Pakistan have many ties and many common interests.
('98', 458, 6, 13, 908214) India desires nothing more earnestly than to live with her neighbour State on terms of close and lasting friendship.
('98', 458, 6, 14, 908331) Peace is to the interest of both States; indeed to the interest of the world.
('98', 458, 6, 15, 908409) The Government of India’s approach to the Security Council is inspired by the sincere hope that, through the prompt action of the Council, peace may be preserved.
('98', 458, 7, 16, 908572) 16. The text of this reference to the Security Council is being telegraphed to the Government of Pakistan.

('98', 459, 2, 3, 908791) VALLABHBHAI PATEL’S STATEMENT TO THE PRESS1
('98', 459, 3, 4, 908835) NEW DELHI, January 12, 1948
('98', 459, 4, 5, 908863) I am sure all of you have read the Press statement of Mr. Ghulam Mohammad, Finance Minister of Pakistan, on the payment of cash balances to the Pakistan Government.
('98', 459, 4, 6, 909028) The Finance Minister of Pakistan has had a varied career of responsibility as a civil servant—Finance Minister of Hyderabad State, and a participant in ‘big business’.
('98', 459, 4, 7, 909196) One would not normally expect in his statements the defects of suppressio veri and suggestio falsi.
('98', 459, 4, 8, 909296) But I regret to observe that not only does his statement abound in these, but in his utter desperation at seeing his financial anticipations wrecked by the actions of his own Government in regard to Kashmir, he has cast discretion and judgment to the winds and descended down to the familiar arts of a bully and a blackmailer.
('98', 459, 5, 9, 909623) I use these epithets deliberately, for to anyone reading his statement dispassionately it would be obvious that he has tried to browbeat the Reserve Bank of India into submission by a liberal use of threats and insinuations, has charged the Government of India with bad faith in the hope that the charge would gain for him his coveted ransom, and has tried to invoke the assistance of international opinion in the expectation that the threatened exposure before the world would make the Government of India bend in its attitude on this subject.
('98', 459, 5, 10, 910168) I quite concede that the desperate situation in which he finds himself calls for rather drastic remedies but we are entitled to expect of him a balanced approach to this problem rather than these filibustering tactics, the failure of which is as certain as daylight.
('98', 459, 5, 11, 910435) Further, in his overzeal to achieve his object by all manner of means, the Pakistan Finance Minister has, I would presently show, paid little attention to truth and shown little regard for facts.
('98', 459, 6, 12, 910631) Let us first deal with his statement that “none of us had the slightest indication that the Kashmir problem would be dragged in”, his accusation of bad faith and similar other statements of an accusatory nature.
('98', 459, 6, 13, 910843) To deal with these I would give in brief a resume of the course of negotiations.
('98', 459, 6, 14, 910924) The series of meetings held between the representatives of the Pakistan and the Indian Governments in the last week of November were intended to iron out all our differences including the question of Kashmir.
('98', 459, 6, 15, 911133) The discussions held were not confined to mere partition issues, but covered Kashmir, refugees and other important evacuation matters as well.
('98', 459, 6, 16, 911276) On the 26th November talks on Kashmir were held in an atmosphere of hope, goodwill and
('98', 459, 7, 17, 911363) 1 Vide “Speech at Prayer Meeting”, 16 1 1948.
('98', 460, 0, 1, 911409) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 461
('98', 460, 1, 2, 911456) cordiality, and were continued simultaneously with the discussions of financial and other questions on subsequent days.
('98', 460, 1, 3, 911576) On the 27th November, informal and provisional agreement was reached on the two issues of division of cash balances, and the sharing of the uncovered debt.
('98', 460, 1, 4, 911732) The Pakistan representatives were in some haste and tried to hustle us into agreeing to announce these agreements.
('98', 460, 1, 5, 911847) We resisted it.
('98', 460, 1, 6, 911863) Indeed, on the 27th evening, I issued a statement to the Press asking them not to speculate on the nature of the talks, but to wait until an authoritative statement was issued after the talks had concluded.
('98', 460, 2, 7, 912070) Here is what I said then: “All out efforts are being made for a settlement on all outstanding matters, but any speculations on the nature of the talks would do more harm than good.
('98', 460, 2, 8, 912251) All that I can say at present is that discussions are being held and the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister of the Pakistan Government are staying on till Saturday.
('98', 460, 2, 9, 912421) A detailed statement will be issued when the talks are concluded.
('98', 460, 2, 10, 912487) Till then reports about any settlement on any individual item or issue between the two Governments must be regarded as premature and lacking authority.”
('98', 460, 3, 11, 912640) The next morning my statement which was read at a meeting at Government House at which both the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister of Pakistan were present, that we would not regard the settlement of these issues as final unless agreement had been reached on all outstanding issues.
('98', 460, 3, 12, 912928) I made it quite clear then that we would not agree to any payment until the Kashmir affair was settled.
('98', 460, 3, 13, 913032) Accordingly, no announcement of the agreement was made.
('98', 460, 3, 14, 913088) In the meantime, Pakistan representatives postponed their departure and talks on Kashmir and other matters were continued with rather varying results on different issues.
('98', 460, 3, 15, 913259) Working in this somewhat improved atmosphere, we reached a settlement on all other out tanding issues relating to partition, and the informal agreement was reported to the Partition Council at its meeting on the 1st December, though they were to be reduced to writing later.
('98', 460, 3, 16, 913534) This was completed on the 2nd December, but it was agreed even then not to make an announcement on the subject until after the Lahore discussions on Kashmir and other outstanding issues had been, as was then hoped, successfully concluded.
('98', 460, 4, 17, 913773) The position was further confirmed by the submission made on the 3rd December by both the parties before the Arbitral Tribunal that the prospects of all the references being settled were very good, that a further meeting was to be held on the 8th and 9th at Lahore and the situation would then be clearer.
('98', 460, 4, 18, 914079) The discussions were resumed at Lahore on the 8th and 9th December.
('98', 460, 4, 19, 914147) But in the meantime, it was found that feverish attempts were being made by the Pakistan Government to secure the payment of Rs. 55 crores which it had been agreed to allocate to Pakistan out of the cash balances.
('98', 460, 4, 20, 914361) We resisted these attempts.
('98', 460, 4, 21, 914389) Nevertheless, evidently in an attempt to isolate the issue and force our hands contrary to the understanding reached, the Pakistan High Commissioner on the 7th December gave a Press interview
('98', 461, 0, 1, 914581) 462 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 461, 1, 2, 914623) announcing the agreement reached on the financial issues.
('98', 461, 1, 3, 914681) When, however, we stuck to our previous position and reiterated it during the Lahore discussion, though in deference to Pakistan’s insistence on the announcement of the agreement on financial issues we agreed to make a short statement on the 9th December in the Legislature, which was then sitting in Delhi, the Pakistan Finance Minister showed also such indecent haste in rushing to the Press in this matter that he actually gave an interview on the subject on the 7th December itself.
('98', 461, 1, 4, 915168) Pakistan’s game was by then quite clear.
('98', 461, 1, 5, 915209) Armed with this understanding on the question of public announcement by us of the agreement on financial issues, their attitude on the Kashmir stiffened and the prospect of agreement which seemed so near at Delhi receded.
('98', 461, 1, 6, 915431) I then felt it necessary in my statement to the Assembly on 9th December to make it quite clear that the implementation of this agreement was to be as far as possible simultaneous with the settlement of the Kashmir issue.
('98', 461, 1, 7, 915653) The Pakistan Government did not take any exception to this statement at the time.
('98', 461, 1, 8, 915735) In the subsequent detailed statement which I made on the 12th in the presence of the Pakistan High Commissioner, I again repeated that the successful implementation of this agreement depended on the continuation of goodwill, spirit of accommodation and conciliation on the other vital issues.
('98', 461, 1, 9, 916028) Quite obviously Kashmir was one of such issues.
('98', 461, 1, 10, 916076) Pakistan still made no protest.
('98', 461, 1, 11, 916108) To all approaches for payment of the Rs. 55 crores, we returned a negative answer.
('98', 461, 1, 12, 916191) Then came the final talks on the Kashmir issue on the 22nd December.
('98', 461, 1, 13, 916260) It was then for the first time during these discussions that the Pakistan Prime Minister took exception to our stand that the financial and Kashmir issues stood together as regards implementation and asked for immediate implementation of the payment of Rs. 55 crores.
('98', 461, 1, 14, 916528) We made it clear to him then and subsequently in our telegram dated the 30th December that we stood by the agreement but that in view of the hostile attitude of the Pakistan Government in regard to Kashmir the payment of the amount would have to be postponed in accordance with our stand throughout the negotiations.
('98', 461, 2, 15, 916845) Thus it is our case that far from our having done anything unfair to Pakistan or in breach of any agreement, it is the Pakistan representatives who were all the time trying to soft pedal the Kashmir issue in order to secure concessions from us on the financial issues and to manoeuvre us into making an isolated public announcement on the subject without reference to other vital issues between the two Governments.
('98', 461, 2, 16, 917261) We consistently and successfully resisted this despite attempt by the Pakistan High Commissioner and Finance Minister to force our hands.
('98', 461, 2, 17, 917399) Far from there being bad faith on our part, we genuinely and sincerely meant this settlement as part of an overall settlement which would have been conducive to the maintenance of friendly and peaceful relations between the two sister Dominions.
('98', 461, 3, 18, 917645) It is also our claim that in agreeing to these terms of the financial settlement, we were actuated by generous sentiments towards Pakistan and a sincere desire, as I
('98', 462, 0, 1, 917811) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 463
('98', 462, 1, 2, 917858) made clear in the Partition Council, “to see Pakistan grow into a prosperous neighbour”.
('98', 462, 1, 3, 917947) We hoped that Pakistan would reciprocate on other issues which unfortunately still divided us.
('98', 462, 1, 4, 918042) That the financial settlement was attractive to Pakistan and would be a great asset to Pakistan’s economy is clear from the statements issued by the Pakistan High Commissioner and Sir Archibald Rowlands (former Finance Member of Viceroy’s Council).
('98', 462, 1, 5, 918291) It is, therefore, quite plain that having secured terms which were essential to hold Pakistan’s finances together, the Pakistan Government failed in their obligation to respond to India’s gesture on other issues.
('98', 462, 2, 6, 918504) I would also point out that the Government of India took a more comprehensive view of our obligation to the securing of a just and peaceful settlement than the Pakistan Government.
('98', 462, 2, 7, 918685) We realized throughout that neighbourly relations between ourselves and Pakistan could be restored and maintained only if the spirit of amity, tolerance and goodwill pervaded throughout the entire field of controversy; the Pakistan Government obviously intended to take undue advantage of our generous attitude and exhibit these virtues in a narrow, restricted and selfish sphere.
('98', 462, 2, 8, 919066) The need for a comprehensive view was and still is quite clear.
('98', 462, 2, 9, 919130) Apart from other factors, India has taken over the entire debt of undivided India and depends on Pakistan’s bona fides and goodwill to make equated payment by easy and long term instalments of its debt to India after a four year moratorium period.
('98', 462, 2, 10, 919378) We cannot, therefore, afford to let conflicts endanger our credit and security and throw into the melting pot some of the vital points in the financial agreement itself.
('98', 462, 2, 11, 919548) Obviously, therefore, India must provide against strained relations worsening into open breach and thereby, as I was careful to point out in my statement of the 12th December, “placing all the good work achieved in jeopardy”.
('98', 462, 3, 12, 919774) We are, therefore, fully justified in providing against Pakistan’s possible continuance of aggressive actions in regard to Kashmir by postponing the implementation of the agreement.
('98', 462, 3, 13, 919956) We have made it clear to the Pakistan Government more than once that we stand by the agreement which we reached.
('98', 462, 3, 14, 920069) The agreement does not bind the Government of India to any fixed date for payment and we cannot reasonably be asked to make a payment of cash balances to Pakistan when an armed conflict with its forces is in progress and threatens to assume an even more dangerous character, which is likely to destroy the whole basis of the financial agreement and would endanger other parts of the agreement, such as arrangements for taking over of debt, and division of stores, etc.
('98', 462, 4, 15, 920538) The Pakistan Finance Minister claims the amount of Rs. 55 crores as belonging to Pakistan.
('98', 462, 4, 16, 920629) He has apparently overlooked the fact that on the 14th August 1947, after the Partition Council had decided to allocate the working balance ofRs. 20 crores to the Pakistan Government, the then undivided Government of India issued an order in the following terms to the Reserve Bank:
('98', 463, 0, 1, 920912) 464 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('98', 463, 1, 2, 920954) PLEASE TRANSFER TWENTY, HALF OF FORTY CRORES, FROM
('98', 463, 2, 3, 921005) CENTRAL CLOSING CASH BALANCE ON THE 14TH INSTANT
('98', 463, 3, 4, 921054) TO PAKISTAN AND BALANCE TO INDIAN DOMINION AS
('98', 463, 4, 5, 921100) OPENING BALANCE ON THE 15TH.
('98', 463, 5, 6, 921129) A copy of this telegram was endorsed to the Pakistan wing of the then Finance Department, and no objection was, or has been, raised to this accounting.
('98', 463, 5, 7, 921281) It follows from this that so far as the bank accounts are concerned, there is no balance of the old undivided Government to be operated upon; the money stands in the name of the Indian Dominion and it is only on the authority of the Indian Dominion that any share can be allocated to the Government of Pakistan.
('98', 463, 5, 8, 921593) The relevant portion of the Partition Council minutes also runs thus:
('98', 463, 6, 9, 921663) “In addition to the 20 crores, already made over to Pakistan, 55 crores will be allocated to Pakistan in full and final settlement of its claim for a share of the undivided Government’s cash balance and of the cash balance investment account.” It is clear, therefore, that nothing belongs to Pakistan until the Government of India transfer the amount to its account.
('98', 463, 7, 10, 922030) This clear cut position makes the Pakistan Finance Minister’s outburst against the Reserve Bank appear somewhat hysterical and rhetorical.
('98', 463, 7, 11, 922169) The Reserve Bank cannot do anything without the specific instructions of the Government of India who are the only competent authority to operate the account.
('98', 463, 7, 12, 922327) He has accused the Government of India of interfering in the discharge of its duties towards the Pakistan Government and has characterized this alleged interference not only as an unfriendly act, but as an act of aggression.
('98', 463, 7, 13, 922552) I wish to say in the most emphatic terms that this accusation is completely baseless and devoid of any element of truth whatsoever.
('98', 463, 7, 14, 922684) I understand that the Reserve Bank of India first received the demand for the payment of Rs. 55 crores on the 6th of this month in a memorandum handed over to the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank at Karachi.
('98', 463, 7, 15, 922895) I also understand that the Governor to whom this memorandum was telegraphed by the Deputy Governor has sent an appropriate reply.
('98', 463, 7, 16, 923025) So far as the Government of India are concerned, I would say that when the Reserve Bank mentioned an approach by the Pakistan Government for temporary accommodation from the Bank, the Government of India made it clear to the Bank that it was a matter for the Bank alone to decide.
('98', 463, 7, 17, 923306) Indeed, the Government of India have made every effort to avoid dragging the Reserve Bank into the controversy.
('98', 463, 7, 18, 923418) The blame for attempting to force the Reserve Bank into taking sides must rest with the Pakistan Finance Minister.
('98', 463, 7, 19, 923533) Neither the manner nor the nature of the attempt reflects creditably on the honesty of purpose and the motives of the Pakistan Government.
('98', 463, 8, 20, 923672) Gentlemen, I think I have said enough to prove how unfounded and
('98', 464, 0, 1, 923737) VOL. 98: 6 DECEMBER, 1947 30 JANUARY, 1948 465
('98', 464, 1, 2, 923784) insubstantial are the allegations made by the Pakistan Finance Minister against the Government of India.
('98', 464, 1, 3, 923889) We have also shown how we have held consistently to the position that the settlement of the financial issues cannot be isolated from that of other vital issues and has to be implemented simultaneously.
('98', 464, 1, 4, 924091) There can be no question of our repudiating the agreement reached.
('98', 464, 1, 5, 924158) We only desire that the appropriate atmosphere conditioned by the agreement must be created for its implementation.
('98', 464, 1, 6, 924274) If the Pakistan Government desires for payment of cash balance in advance, it is obvious that they are motivated by factors wholly opposed to the spirit underlying the agreement.
('98', 464, 1, 7, 924453) We are thus fully justified in resisting these machinations which, if successful, would vitiate the very basis of the agreement and adversely affect, by facilitating Pakistan’s aggressive designs on India, the implementation of other vital parts of the agreement.

('98', 464, 4, 10, 924764) GOVERNMENT COMMUNIQUE1
('98', 464, 5, 11, 924787) The Government of India have fully clarified their position in regard to the financial settlement arrived at between them and the Government of Pakistan.
('98', 464, 5, 12, 924941) They have declared that they abide by that settlement, but that the implementation of it, in regard to the cash balances, must be considered as part of an overall settlement of outstanding questions in issue between India and Pakistan.
('98', 464, 5, 13, 925177) They regret that the Finance Minister of the Pakistan Government should have advanced arguments which are unsupported by facts and which they cannot accept.
('98', 464, 5, 14, 925334) The factual position has been clearly stated in the statements issued by the Deputy Prime Minister, and the Finance Minister of the Government of India.
('98', 464, 5, 15, 925487) The facts and arguments contained in these statements represent the deliberate and unanimous opinion of the Cabinet.
('98', 464, 5, 16, 925604) They regret that the Finance Minister of the Pakistan Government should have again challenged these incontrovertible facts which justify fully the position taken up by the Government of India both on legal and other grounds.
('98', 464, 6, 17, 925829) The Government have, however, shared the world wide anxiety over the fast undertaken by Gandhiji, the Father of the Nation.
('98', 464, 6, 18, 925953) In common with him they have anxiously searched for ways and means to remove ill will, prejudice and suspicion, which have poisoned the relations between India and Pakistan.
('98', 464, 6, 19, 926127) Impelled by the earnest desire to help in every way open to them in the object which Gandhiji has at heart, the Government have sought for some tangible and striking contribution to the movement for ending the physical suffering of the nation’s soul and to turn the

('98', 465, 1, 2, 926481) nation’s mind from the present distemper, bitterness and suspicion to constructive and creative effort.
('98', 465, 1, 3, 926585) The Government are anxious to remove as far as possible, without detriment to the national good, every cause, which leads to friction between India and Pakistan.
('98', 465, 2, 4, 926747) In view of the appeal made by Gandhiji to the nation, the Government have decided to remove the one cause of suspicion and friction between the two States which, consistently with national honour and interest, it is in their power to remove.
('98', 465, 2, 5, 926989) They make this spontaneous gesture in the earnest hope that it will be appreciated in the spirit in which it is made and that it will help in producing an atmosphere of goodwill for which Gandhiji is suffering crucifixion of the flesh and thereby lead this great servant of the nation to end his fast and add still further to his unparalleled services to India.
('98', 465, 3, 6, 927351) The Government have decided to implement immediately the financial agreement with Pakistan in regard to the cash balances.
('98', 465, 3, 7, 927474) The amount due to Pakistan on the basis of the agreement, i.
('98', 465, 3, 8, 927535) e., Rs. 55 crores, minus the expenditure incurred by the Government of India since August 15 on Pakistan account will, therefore, be paid to the Government of Pakistan.
('98', 465, 4, 9, 927704) The decision is the Government contribution, to the best of its ability, to the non violent and noble effort made by Gandhiji in accordance with the glorious traditions of this great country, for peace and goodwill.
