('65', 1, 6, 10, 1728) BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
('65', 1, 7, 11, 1746) I got your letter.
('65', 1, 7, 12, 1765) The Kaka affair has become a painful one.
('65', 1, 7, 13, 1807) But you should laugh away the thing.
('65', 1, 7, 14, 1844) It will all subside by and by.
('65', 1, 7, 15, 1875) I think there is no malice behind the outcry.
('65', 1, 7, 16, 1921) I am trying to calm it and hope to succeed.
('65', 1, 7, 17, 1965) There is nothing but simple misunderstanding behind the whole affair.
('65', 1, 7, 18, 2035) I will not let Kaka go in this manner.
('65', 1, 7, 19, 2074) I have sent you a copy of the letter 3 I have written to Mavalankar.
('65', 1, 7, 20, 2143) Kaka has been laid up with fever from the very next day after he arrived here.
('65', 1, 7, 21, 2222) The temperature has not come down even once.
('65', 1, 7, 22, 2267) It was above 100° this morning.
('65', 1, 7, 23, 2299) It rises to 102°.
('65', 1, 7, 24, 2317) There are no other symptoms, except cold and a little cough.
('65', 1, 7, 25, 2378) There is some fear that it may be typhoid.
('65', 1, 7, 26, 2421) Write a brief note to him.
('65', 1, 7, 27, 2448) Jones 4 is better but not quite well.

('65', 1, 7, 31, 2591) They were dragged to Khamgaon from there.

('65', 2, 9, 11, 3299) ’s 3 is a pathetic tale.
('65', 2, 9, 12, 3324) 4 has badly deceived us.
('65', 2, 9, 13, 3349) was simply enticed.
('65', 2, 9, 14, 3369) Of course, she too was at fault.
('65', 2, 9, 15, 3402) Ultimately, we may say .
('65', 2, 9, 16, 3427) fled from here.
('65', 2, 9, 17, 3443) He did not even see me before leaving; he had told many lies too.
('65', 2, 9, 18, 3509) Even in Sabarmati he had been given to self indulgence.
('65', 2, 9, 19, 3565) The whole affair is deplorable.
('65', 2, 9, 20, 3597) seems to be a simple innocent girl like any other Malabar girl.
('65', 2, 9, 21, 3661) It seems somewhat risky to keep her here.
('65', 2, 9, 22, 3703) Anyway her husband must be informed, but I do not wish to take any step without consulting you.
('65', 2, 9, 23, 3799) You may come over here if that is necessary.
('65', 2, 9, 24, 3844) There is no cause for panic.
('65', 2, 9, 25, 3873) is well looked after.

('65', 3, 1, 2, 4157) 5. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
('65', 3, 2, 3, 4183) WARDHAGANJ, September 17, 1934
('65', 3, 3, 4, 4214) The rumour that I had contemplated severing all physical connection with the Congress was true.
('65', 3, 3, 5, 4310) However, for considerations urged by many friends who had come to Wardha during the meetings of the Working Committee and the Parliamentary Board last week, I agreed with them that it might be safer for me to leave the Congress, if at all, after the forthcoming session.
('65', 3, 3, 6, 4581) There was an intermediate course suggested by Pandit Govind Vallabh Pant and Mr. Rafi Ahmed Kidwai of remaining in the Congress without participating in the active administration of the organization but both Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad strongly disapproved of that course.
('65', 3, 3, 7, 4879) Sardar Vallabhbhai had agreed with me that the time had arrived for me to retire from the Congress but many others would not endorse that view.
('65', 3, 3, 8, 5023) After due consideration of all the pros and cons 1 have adopted the safe and prudent course of postponing the final step, at least till after the meeting of the Congress session in October.
('65', 3, 3, 9, 5213) one tempting idea behind the insistence on postponement was that it would enable me to test the accuracy of my impression that a very large body of Congress intelligentsia were tired of my method and views, and the programme based upon them, that I was a hindrance rather than a help to the natural growth of the Congress, that instead of remaining the most democratic and representative institution in the country, the Congress had degenerated into an organization dominated by my one personality and that in it there was no free play of reason.
('65', 3, 3, 10, 5760) If I am to test the truth or otherwise of my impression, naturally I must put before the public the reason on which my impression was based and my own proposals based thereon.
('65', 3, 3, 11, 5936) Congressmen might vote on them and thus clearly register their opinion.
('65', 3, 3, 12, 6008) I must try to do this as briefly as I can.
('65', 3, 3, 13, 6051) It has appeared to me that there is a growing and vital difference of outlook between many Congressmen and myself.
('65', 3, 3, 14, 6166) I seem to be going in a direction just opposite of what many of the most intellectual Congressmen would gladly and enthusiastically
('65', 4, 0, 1, 6298) VOL. 65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 5
('65', 4, 1, 2, 6347) take, if they were not hampered by their unexampled loyalty to me.
('65', 4, 1, 3, 6414) No leader can expect greater loyalty and devotion than I have received from intellectually minded Congressmen even when they have protested and signified their disapproval of the policies It have laid before the Congress.
('65', 4, 1, 4, 6636) For me any more to draw upon this loyalty and devotion is to put undue strain upon them.
('65', 4, 1, 5, 6725) Their loyalty cannot blind my eyes to what appears to me to be fundamental differences between the Congress intelligentsia and me.
('65', 4, 1, 6, 6856) Let me state them.
('65', 4, 1, 7, 6875) I put the spinning wheel and khadi in the forefront.
('65', 4, 1, 8, 6928) Hand spinning by the Congress intelligentsia has all but disappeared.
('65', 4, 1, 9, 6998) The general body of them have no faith in it and yet if I could carry their reason with me, I would substitute the four anna franchise by personal daily hand spinning.
('65', 4, 1, 10, 7166) The khadi clause of the Congress constitution has been almost a dead letter from the beginning and Congressmen have not been wanting who have reminded me that I am responsible for the hypocrisy and evasion about the working of the khadi clause.
('65', 4, 1, 11, 7411) I ought to have realized that it was not passed out of deep conviction, but largely out of personal loyalty to me.
('65', 4, 1, 12, 7526) I must own that there is considerable force in the argument.
('65', 4, 1, 13, 7587) Nevertheless my conviction is growing that if India is to win complete independence in terms of the toiling millions and through unadulterated non violence, the spinning wheel and khadi have to be as natural to the educated few as to the partially unemployed and semi starved millions, who, for not using their hands for the purpose for which nature has endowed man with them, have become almost like beasts of burden.
('65', 4, 1, 14, 8006) The spinning wheel is thus an emblem of human dignity and equality in the truest sense of the term.
('65', 4, 1, 15, 8106) It is the handmaid of agriculture.
('65', 4, 1, 16, 8141) It is the nation’s second lung.
('65', 4, 1, 17, 8173) We are perishing because we are using only one lung.
('65', 4, 1, 18, 8226) Yet only a few Congressmen have a living faith in the Indiawide potency of the wheel.
('65', 4, 1, 19, 8312) The removal of the khadi clause in the constitution would mean a removal of the living link between the Congress and the millions whom it has from its inception sought to represent and yet if it remains it has to be rightly enforced; but it cannot be, if a substantial majority of Congressmen have no living faith in it.
('65', 4, 1, 20, 8633) Take again the Parliamentary Board.
('65', 4, 1, 21, 8669) Though the author of non co operation I am convinced that in the present circumstances of
('65', 5, 0, 1, 8759) 6 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 5, 1, 2, 8799) the country and in the absence of any general scheme of civil resistance, a Parliamentary Party within the Congress is the necessary part of any programme that may be framed by the Congress but there are sharp differences of opinion among us on that point.
('65', 5, 1, 3, 9056) The force with which I urged the programme at the A. I. C. C. meeting in Patna, 1
('65', 5, 2, 4, 9138) I know, oppressed many of our best colleagues but they hesitated to act according to their own conviction.
('65', 5, 2, 5, 9245) Up to a point suppression of one’s views in favour of those of another considered superior in wisdom or experience is virtuous and desirable for healthy growth of an organization.
('65', 5, 2, 6, 9425) It becomes a terrible oppression when one is called upon to repeat the performance from day to day.
('65', 5, 2, 7, 9525) Though I have never wished any such untoward result, I cannot conceal from me or the public the tragic fact that such has been my own experience.
('65', 5, 2, 8, 9671) Many have despaired of resisting me.
('65', 5, 2, 9, 9708) This is a humiliating revelation to me, a born democrat.
('65', 5, 2, 10, 9765) I make that claim if a complete identification with the poorest of mankind, an intense longing to live no better than they and a corresponding conscious effort to approach that level to the best of one’s ability can entitle one to make it.
('65', 5, 2, 11, 10005) I have welcomed the formation of the Socialist Group.
('65', 5, 2, 12, 10059) 2 Many of them are respected and self sacrificing co workers.
('65', 5, 2, 13, 10121) With all this, I have fundamental differences with them on the programme published in their authorized pamphlets.
('65', 5, 2, 14, 10235) But I would not by reason of the moral pressure I may be able to exert suppress the spread of ideas propounded in their literature.
('65', 5, 2, 15, 10367) I may not interfere with the free ex pression of those ideas however distasteful some of them may be to me.
('65', 5, 2, 16, 10475) If they gain ascendancy in the Congress, as they well may, I cannot remain in the Congress.
('65', 5, 2, 17, 10567) For me to be in active opposition should be unthinkable.
('65', 5, 2, 18, 10624) Though I have identified myself with many organizations during a long period of public service I have never accepted that position.
('65', 5, 2, 19, 10756) Then there is the policy advocated by some in regard to the States which is wholly different from what I have advised.
('65', 5, 2, 20, 10875) I have given many an anxious hour to the question but I have not been able to alter my view.
('65', 5, 3, 21, 10968) 1 Vide “Speech at A.I.C.C. Meeting, Patna II”, 19 5 1934. 2 The Congress Socialist Party was formed at Patna in May 1934.
('65', 6, 0, 1, 11090) VOL. 65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 7
('65', 6, 1, 2, 11139) Even on untouchability my method of approach is perhaps different from that of many if not most Congressmen.
('65', 6, 1, 3, 11248) For me, it is a deeply religious and moral issue.
('65', 6, 1, 4, 11298) Many think that it was a profound error for me to have disturbed the course of the civil resistance struggle by taking up the question in the manner and at the time I did.
('65', 6, 1, 5, 11470) I feel that I would have been untrue to myself, if I had taken any other course.
('65', 6, 1, 6, 11551) Last of all take non violence.
('65', 6, 1, 7, 11582) After 14 years of trial it still remains a policy with the majority of Congressmen whereas it is a fundamental creed with me.
('65', 6, 1, 8, 11708) That Congressmen do not still regard non violence as a creed is no fault of theirs.
('65', 6, 1, 9, 11792) It is undoubtedly my faulty presentation and still more faulty execution that are responsible for this failure.
('65', 6, 1, 10, 11904) I have no consciousness of faulty presentation or execution.
('65', 6, 1, 11, 11965) But it is the only possible inference from the fact that it has not yet become an integral part of the lives of Congressmen.
('65', 6, 1, 12, 12090) And if there is uncertainty about non violence there must be still more about civil resistance.
('65', 6, 1, 13, 12186) In spite of my 27 years of study and practice of the doctrine, I cannot claim to know all about it.
('65', 6, 1, 14, 12286) The field of research is necessarily limited as occasions for civil resistance in a man’s life must not be frequent.
('65', 6, 1, 15, 12403) It can only come after voluntary obedience to authority, whether of parents, teachers or other elders, religious or secular.
('65', 6, 1, 16, 12528) There need be no wonder that as the only expert, however imperfect among us, I should have come to the conclusion that it should for some time to come be limited only to me.
('65', 6, 1, 17, 12702) This was necessary in order to minimize errors and mischief proceeding from them as also to explore its hidden possibilities.
('65', 6, 1, 18, 12828) But again for no fault of Congressmen it has been increasingly difficult for me to carry the reason of fellow Congressmen with me in all resolutions 1 recently passed on the subject, while they have generously voted for them.
('65', 6, 1, 19, 13054) Even the memory of the sense of opposition which they experienced at the time of voting without an intelligent belief in these resolutions oppresses me just as much as they were oppressed.
('65', 6, 1, 20, 13243) They and I must be free from this oppression if we are all to grow in pursuit of what we believe to be the common goal.
('65', 6, 1, 21, 13363) Hence it is necessary for all concerned to act freely and boldly according to their convictions.
('65', 6, 1, 22, 13460) I have in my Patna statement 2, recommending the suspension of civil resistance, drawn attention to the failure of civil resistance to achieve two obvious results.
('65', 6, 1, 23, 13624) If we had the full non violent spirit in us
('65', 6, 2, 24, 13668) 1 Vide “Resolution on council entry”, 19 5 1934. 2 Vide “Statement to the press”, 2 4 1934.
('65', 7, 0, 1, 13760) 8 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 7, 1, 2, 13800) it should have been self evident and should not have escaped the notice of the Government that their ordinances were certainly not warranted by any of the ‘misdeeds’ done by or imputed to us.
('65', 7, 1, 3, 13992) They were undoubtedly intended to break our spirits anyhow, but it would be wrong if we contended that civil resisters were above reproach.
('65', 7, 1, 4, 14132) If we were non violent through and through our non violence would have been self evident.
('65', 7, 1, 5, 14222) Nor were we able to show to the terrorists that we had greater faith in our non violence than they in their violence.
('65', 7, 1, 6, 14340) On the contrary many of us made them feel that we had the same spirit of violence in our breasts that they had.
('65', 7, 1, 7, 14452) Only we did not believe in deeds of violence.
('65', 7, 1, 8, 14498) Terrorists rightly argued that if the spirit of violence was common to both, the policy of doing or not doing violence was a matter of opinion.
('65', 7, 1, 9, 14642) I need not repeat what I have said before that the country has made great strides towards non violence indeed and that many have exhibited great courage and self sacrifice.
('65', 7, 1, 10, 14815) All I want to say is that ours has not been unadulterated non violence in thought, word and deed.
('65', 7, 1, 11, 14913) It is now my paramount duty to devise ways and means of showing demonstrably to the Government and the terrorists the efficacy of non violence as a means of achieving the right thing including freedom in every sense of the term.
('65', 7, 2, 12, 15142) For this experiment, to which my life is dedicated, I need complete detachment and absolute freedom of action.
('65', 7, 2, 13, 15253) Satyagraha, of which civil resistance is but a part, is to me the universal law of life.
('65', 7, 2, 14, 15342) ‘Satya’, in truth, is my God.
('65', 7, 2, 15, 15372) I can only search Him through non violence and in no other way and the freedom of my country as of the world is surely included in the search for truth.
('65', 7, 2, 16, 15525) I cannot suspend this search for anything in this world or another.
('65', 7, 2, 17, 15593) I have entered political life in pursuit of this search and if it cannot carry reason as well as heart of the educated Congressmen when I say that this search necessarily includes complete independence, and many other things which may be part of truth, it is plain I should work single handed in implicit faith that what I fail to make clear to my countrymen today shall be clear to them some day of itself or, if God wills it, through some apt word He may put in my mouth or some apt work which He may prompt me to do.
('65', 8, 0, 1, 16113) VOL. 65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 9
('65', 8, 1, 2, 16162) In matters of such tremendous importance a mechanical vote or a grudging assent will be wholly inadequate if not injurious to the cause itself.
('65', 8, 1, 3, 16306) I have referred to the common goal, but I have begun to doubt if all Congressmen understand the same thing by the expression complete independence.
('65', 8, 1, 4, 16454) I want for India complete independence in the full English sense of that English expression.
('65', 8, 1, 5, 16547) For me poorna swaraj has an infinitely larger meaning than complete independence, but even poorna swaraj is not self explained.
('65', 8, 1, 6, 16675) No one word or compound expression will give us a meaning which all can understand.
('65', 8, 1, 7, 16759) Hence on several occasions I have given several definitions of swaraj.
('65', 8, 1, 8, 16830) I hold that they are all true, not at all self contradictory.
('65', 8, 1, 9, 16892) They are all hopelessly incomplete even when put.
('65', 8, 1, 10, 16942) together, but I do not wish to labour this point further.
('65', 8, 1, 11, 17000) My mention of the difficulty, if not impossibility, of giving a complete definition leads me to another serious point of difference between many Congressmen and myself.
('65', 8, 1, 12, 17169) I have always said since 1908 that means and end are convertible terms and that, therefore, where the means are various and even contradictory the end must be different and even contradictory.
('65', 8, 1, 13, 17362) We have always control over the means, never on the end, but may not bother about its content if we all em ploy identical means with identical connotation for them.
('65', 8, 1, 14, 17527) It will be admitted that many Congressmen do not admit this, to me the obvious truth.
('65', 8, 1, 15, 17613) They believe that end justifies means whatever they may be.
('65', 8, 1, 16, 17673) It is the sum total of these differences which has sterilized the existing Congress programme because members who gave their lip assent to it, without believing in it, have naturally failed to reduce it to practice and yet I have no other programme save the Congress programme now before the country.
('65', 8, 1, 17, 17974) Untouchability, Hindu Muslim unity, total prohibition, hand spinning with khadi and cent per cent swadeshi in the sense of the revival of village industries and general reorganization of seven lakhs of villages ought to give all satisfaction that one’s love of one’s country may demand.
('65', 8, 1, 18, 18261) Personally I would like to bury myself in an Indian village, preferably in a Frontier village.
('65', 8, 1, 19, 18356) If the Khudai Khidmatgars are truly non violent they will contribute the largest share to the promotion of non violent spirit and of Hindu Muslim unity, for if they are non violent in thought, word and deed and are lovers of
('65', 9, 0, 1, 18581) 10 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 9, 1, 2, 18622) Hindu Muslim unity, surely through them we should see the accomplishment of the two things we need most in this land.
('65', 9, 1, 3, 18740) The Afghan menace which we dread so much should then be.
('65', 9, 1, 4, 18797) a thing of the past.
('65', 9, 1, 5, 18818) I am, therefore, yearning to test the truth for myself of the claim that they have imbibed the spirit of non violence and are believers in the heart unity of Hindus, Mussalmans and others.
('65', 9, 1, 6, 19007) I should like also personally to deliver the message of the spinning wheel to them.
('65', 9, 1, 7, 19091) In this and various such other ways I would love to serve the Congress in my own humble manner, whether I am in it or outside.
('65', 9, 1, 8, 19218) I have reserved to the last any reference to the growing corruption in our ranks.
('65', 9, 1, 9, 19300) I have already said enough about it in public.
('65', 9, 1, 10, 19347) In spite of all I have said the Congress still remains in my estimation the most powerful and most representative organization in the country.
('65', 9, 1, 11, 19490) It has a history of uninterrupted noble service and self sacrifice.
('65', 9, 1, 12, 19558) From its inception it has weathered storms, as no other institution has done.
('65', 9, 1, 13, 19636) It has commanded a measure of self sacrifice of which any country would be proud.
('65', 9, 1, 14, 19718) It holds today the largest number of devoted men and women of unimpeachable character.
('65', 9, 1, 15, 19805) If I must leave this organization I shall not do so without a wrench and I should do it only when I am convinced that by being outside I would serve it, that is, the country better than by being in it.
('65', 9, 1, 16, 20007) I propose to test the feeling of the Congress on all the points I have touched by placing before the Subjects Committee certain resolutions giving effect to the views enunciated above.
('65', 9, 1, 17, 20192) The first amendment I would propose is to replace the words “legitimate and peaceful” by the words ‘truthful and non violent’.
('65', 9, 1, 18, 20319) I should not have done so but for the purpose of the opposition which was raised against the utterly innocent use by me of the two adjectives in place of “legitimate and peaceful”.
('65', 9, 1, 19, 20500) If Congressmen really believe in the necessity of truthfulness and non violence for the attainment of our goal they should have no hesitation about accepting the unequivocal adjectives.
('65', 9, 1, 20, 20686) The second amendment would be to replace the four anna franchise by the delivery, by every member to a Congress depot, of 2,000 rounds (one round equal to four feet) per month of well twisted even yarn of not less than 15 counts spun by himself or herself.
('65', 9, 1, 21, 20943) On proof of Poverty, with enough cotton for spinning the requisite quantity, the arguments for and against need not be repeated here.
('65', 10, 0, 1, 21077) VOL. 65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 11
('65', 10, 1, 2, 21127) we are to be a truly democratic body representing even the lowest paid labourer, we cannot do it better than by devising a simple labour franchise.
('65', 10, 2, 3, 21275) Hand spinning is by common consent the lowest paid labour and yet the most dignified.
('65', 10, 2, 4, 21361) It is the nearest approach to adult franchise, within the means of almost everyone who is willing to labour for the sake of the country for half an hour daily.
('65', 10, 2, 5, 21521) Is it too much to expect the intelligentsia and propertied classes to recognize the dignity of labour irrespective of the material benefit it brings?
('65', 10, 2, 6, 21671) Is not labour, like learning, its own reward?
('65', 10, 2, 7, 21717) If we are true servants of the masses, we would take pride in spinning for their sakes.
('65', 10, 2, 8, 21805) I recall what the late Maulana Mahomed Ali used to repeat from many a platform.
('65', 10, 2, 9, 21885) As the sword was the symbol, he would say, of brute force and might, the wheel or the takli was the symbol of non violence, service and humility.
('65', 10, 2, 10, 22031) When the wheel was accepted as part of the National Flag it was surely implied that the spinning wheel would hum in every household.
('65', 10, 2, 11, 22164) If Congress men do not believe in the message of the wheel, we must remove it from the National Flag and khaddar from the constitution.
('65', 10, 2, 12, 22300) It is intolerable that there should be unashamed fraud in the observance of the khaddar clause.
('65', 10, 2, 13, 22396) The third amendment I should propose would be that no one shall be entitled to vote to any Congress election whose name has not been on the Congress register continuously for six months without default and who has not been a habitual wearer wholly of khaddar for that period.
('65', 10, 2, 14, 22672) Great difficulty has been experienced in the working of the khaddar clause.
('65', 10, 2, 15, 22748) It can be easily avoided by giving powers, subject to appeal to the President of the Congress, to the chairmen of the respective committees to decide the question as to whether a particular voter is or is not a habitual wearer wholly of khaddar within the meaning of the constitution.
('65', 10, 2, 16, 23033) No one is to be considered such a wearer who at the time of voting is not manifestly wholly clad in khaddar.
('65', 10, 2, 17, 23142) But no rule however carefully and strictly worded can produce satisfactory results if a large number do not voluntarily carry it out.
('65', 10, 2, 18, 23276) Experience has shown that the Congress is an unwieldy organization even with 6,000 delegates.
('65', 10, 2, 19, 23370) In practice the full number has never attended the Congress and when this Congress register nowhere contains a truly representative list the delegation can hardly be claimed to be as reality.
('65', 11, 0, 1, 23562) 12 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 11, 1, 2, 23603) I would, therefore, have an amendment for the purpose of reducing the number to not more than 1,000 delegates, not more than one delegate per every thousand voters.
('65', 11, 1, 3, 23768) To have full number of delegates would mean one million voters, not an overambitious hope in a country having a population of 315 millions.
('65', 11, 1, 4, 23908) The Congress would by this amendment gain in substance what it may lose in the show of numbers.
('65', 11, 1, 5, 24004) The spectacular part of the session would be kept intact by making ample provision for visitors, but the Reception Committees will be spared the wholly unnecessary anxiety of having to provide accommodation for an unwieldy number of delegates.
('65', 11, 1, 6, 24248) Let us recognize the fact that the Congress enjoys prestige, democratic character and influence not by the number of the delegates and visitors it has drawn to its annual functions but by the ever increasing amount of service it has rendered.
('65', 11, 2, 7, 24491) Western democracy is on its trial, if it has not already proved a failure.
('65', 11, 2, 8, 24566) May it not be reserved to India to evolve the true science of democracy by giving a visible demonstration of this fitness?
('65', 11, 2, 9, 24689) Corruption and hypocrisy ought not to be inevitable products of democracy as they undoubtedly are today; nor bulk a true test of democracy.
('65', 11, 2, 10, 24829) True democracy is not inconsistent with a few persons representing the spirit, the hope and the aspirations of those whom they claim to represent.
('65', 11, 2, 11, 24976) I hold that democracy cannot be evolved by forcible methods.
('65', 11, 2, 12, 25037) The spirit of democracy cannot be in posed from without.
('65', 11, 2, 13, 25094) It has to come from within.
('65', 11, 3, 14, 25122) I have mentioned here only the principal amendments I should propose in the constitution.
('65', 11, 3, 15, 25212) there would be other resolutions bringing out clearly the points I have touched upon in the foregoing paras.
('65', 11, 3, 16, 25321) I don’t need to burden this statement with them.
('65', 11, 4, 17, 25370) My fear is that even the amendments I have named will hardly commend themselves to the large number of Congressmen who will attend the Congress.
('65', 11, 4, 18, 25515) Nevertheless if I am to guide the policy of the Congress I hold them and the resolutions in keeping with the spirit of this statement to be essential for the earliest attainment of our goal.
('65', 11, 5, 19, 25706) No voluntary organization can succeed in its purpose without its resolutions and policies being carried out whole heartedly by its members and no leader can give a good account of himself if his lead
('65', 12, 0, 1, 25906) VOL. 65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 13
('65', 12, 1, 2, 25956) is not faithfully, ungrudgingly and intelligently followed and this is true of a leader who has no resource at his disposal but what truth and non violence can supply.
('65', 12, 1, 3, 26124) It follows, therefore, that there is no room for compromise on the essentials of the programme I have endeavoured to adumbrate in these paras.
('65', 12, 1, 4, 26267) Let Congressmen, therefore, examine it dispassionately and on its merits.
('65', 12, 1, 5, 26341) They must eliminate me from their consideration and give effect to the dictates of their reason.

('65', 14, 3, 5, 29034) Now no one knows what swaraj is.
('65', 14, 3, 6, 29067) If it is merely usurping power from the present rulers, I for one would not be satisfied that we had swaraj.
('65', 14, 3, 7, 29176) But in one sense swaraj was established when the Congress adopted the constitution 1 of 1920 and the policy laid down in virtue of it.

('65', 15, 2, 4, 30469) The way in which Harijan purses collected in different provinces are used is by provinces sending to the Central Board 1 their schemes for approval, and these schemes come to me whenever it is thought necessary by the Central Board.
('65', 15, 2, 5, 30702) You will have, therefore, to convince the Provincial Board of the soundness of your suggestion, and in doing so you will have to show to the Board that your scheme can be worked with the funds at the Local Board’s disposal and consistently with the continuation of the work they have started.

('65', 15, 6, 11, 31163) MARY, 2
('65', 15, 7, 12, 31171) I have your letter.
('65', 15, 7, 13, 31191) In his letter Rajbhoj has used the expression ‘Brahmin’ to mean non Harijan Hindus.
('65', 15, 7, 14, 31275) The Board does not consist exclusively of Brahmins; it has non Brahmins also.
('65', 15, 7, 15, 31353) Nevertheless you should remember that the Board contains only workers and not those who want prominence or cheap credit.
('65', 15, 7, 16, 31474) Strange as it may appear, the largest amount of sacrifice is still to be found among Brahmins, if it is also true that Brahmins are the stumbling block in the way of progress of the campaign against untouchability.
('65', 15, 7, 17, 31689) But no provincial organization is wholly confined to Brahmins.
('65', 15, 7, 18, 31752) As to the second objection, you will be glad to know that there is no Harijan Board which does not contain at least one Harijan, and in several organizations there are many.
('65', 15, 7, 19, 31926) There are hundreds of Harijan Boards affiliated to the Central Board.
('65', 15, 7, 20, 31996) I can claim no merit or credit

('65', 16, 1, 2, 32205) for this event.
('65', 16, 1, 3, 32221) If I could have helped it, I should certainly have confined all these boards exclusively to non Harijans.
('65', 16, 1, 4, 32327) In the place of the word ‘penitents’ read ‘debtors’.
('65', 16, 1, 5, 32380) 1 Harijans are in the place of creditors.
('65', 16, 1, 6, 32422) Have you ever heard of a board of debtors containing a sprinkling of creditors?
('65', 16, 1, 7, 32502) Debtors alone know how to discharge their obligations.
('65', 16, 1, 8, 32557) Creditors will be the judges as to whether they will give them discharge certificates for the payments they will make.
('65', 16, 1, 9, 32676) But they would not even be bothered about the meetings of the debtors.
('65', 16, 1, 10, 32747) They will have their own meetings, their own advisers and the like.
('65', 16, 1, 11, 32815) And I have invited the Harijans to form their own advisory boards which will become irresistible.
('65', 16, 1, 12, 32913) They will, if they are compact bodies, dictate their own terms.
('65', 16, 1, 13, 32977) If you are closely following the Harijan from week to week you will understand surely the meaning of what I have said.
('65', 16, 1, 14, 33096) Marvellous work has been done in the shape of distribution of funds.
('65', 16, 1, 15, 33165) Harijan Boards are intended to be swiftly moving organizations carrying out their operations without fuss.
('65', 16, 1, 16, 33272) They are not debating societies.
('65', 16, 1, 17, 33305) To alter their character would be to turn them into debating societies frittering away time, energy and substance, whereas I want to save every ounce of these solely for the benefit of Harijans.
('65', 16, 1, 18, 33500) Then and then only will there be no ‘you’ and ‘we’, but only ‘we’.
('65', 16, 1, 19, 33567) You have again returned to your proposal about prayer.
('65', 16, 1, 20, 33622) The proposal does not appear to me to be feasible.
('65', 16, 1, 21, 33673) The utmost we have been able to attain in this direction is that we have Mussalman hymns or bhajans as also Christian.
('65', 16, 1, 22, 33792) You may perhaps know that every Friday we have a rendering of “Lead, Kindly Light” in the Ashram and every Thursday we have a very popular Islamic bhajan.
('65', 16, 1, 23, 33947) The Ashram Bhajanavali contains several bhajans from Mussalman sources and you will find also a selection of Christian hymns.
('65', 16, 1, 24, 34073) On certain occasions we have Christian and Mussalman prayers.
('65', 16, 1, 25, 34135) But to make these prayers a daily feature would be entirely mechanical, if not also hypocritical.
('65', 16, 1, 26, 34233) It would be different if we had a large number of Mussalmans and Christians in the different ashrams.
('65', 16, 1, 27, 34335) And if we had an ashram predominantly Mussalman or Christian, there will naturally be generally only Christian or Islamic prayers.
('65', 16, 1, 28, 34466) The point I am trying to make is to show that the ashrams are not theosophical organizations, but they are organizations which have equal regard for all the religions.
('65', 16, 1, 29, 34634) I should expect, therefore, non Hindus in an ashram predominantly Hindu to pay equal respect to the Hindu form of

('65', 17, 1, 3, 34843) And a predominantly Hindu ashram should never be deliberately exclusive and would be expected to pay particular regard to its few Mussalman or Christian inmates.
('65', 17, 1, 4, 35005) Ashrams honestly attempt, though they may ever fail, to reach the ideal of equality and growth from within.

('65', 17, 5, 8, 35268) September 17, 1934
('65', 17, 6, 9, 35287) MANILAL AND SUSHILA, I had received your letters.
('65', 17, 6, 10, 35337) I had long discussions with Andrews.
('65', 17, 6, 11, 35374) The trouble about Sorabji 1 will go on.
('65', 17, 6, 12, 35414) But it is desirable that no attacks should be made on the Agent.
('65', 17, 6, 13, 35479) It would be better to write to him confidentially.
('65', 17, 6, 14, 35530) So far as I can judge from here, attacking him will serve no purpose except giving vent to one’s anger.
('65', 17, 6, 15, 35634) Andrews liked all that you have been doing except the attack on the Agent.
('65', 17, 6, 16, 35709) Schlesin 2
('65', 17, 7, 17, 35720) also didn’t like it.
('65', 17, 7, 18, 35741) You have suggested that Kanti 3 should be sent over there.
('65', 17, 7, 19, 35800) But he does not agree to go.
('65', 17, 7, 20, 35829) He has set his heart on studying.
('65', 17, 7, 21, 35863) I believe Ramdas will require a permit.
('65', 17, 7, 22, 35903) I suspect that they have taken away the rights of even the Colonial born [Indians].
('65', 17, 7, 23, 35987) Ramdas’s plans are still uncertain.
('65', 17, 7, 24, 36023) Just now he has gone to Sabarmati with Ba.
('65', 17, 7, 25, 36066) He had a fairly serious attack of fever there.
('65', 17, 7, 26, 36113) It has come down now.
('65', 17, 7, 27, 36135) He has taken Kanu 4 with him.
('65', 17, 7, 28, 36165) Since he gets good company at Sabarmati, he feels quite cheerful.
('65', 17, 7, 29, 36231) Kanti has gone far away to Travancore, where he will do Harijan work and study at the same time.
('65', 17, 7, 30, 36328) My future plans are uncertain.
('65', 17, 7, 31, 36359) I shall not be able to leave the Congress immediately.
('65', 17, 7, 32, 36414) Let us see what happens in October.

('65', 18, 1, 3, 36657) Thus everything regarding me is uncertain.
('65', 18, 1, 4, 36700) But I don’t worry.
('65', 18, 1, 5, 36719) He who has dedicated his all to Shri Krishna feels at rest in his mind even in the midst of uncertainty.
('65', 18, 1, 6, 36824) Since I am ceaselessly striving to reach that state, I never suffer from worries.
('65', 18, 1, 7, 36906) Where there is complete uncertainty about life itself from moment to moment, why worry about other things?
('65', 18, 1, 8, 37013) Jalbhai 1 came and saw me.
('65', 18, 1, 9, 37040) Omar Sheth seems to have lost his all.
('65', 18, 1, 10, 37079) How did that happen?
('65', 18, 1, 11, 37100) Kishorelal 2 and Gomati 3 are here at present.
('65', 18, 1, 12, 37147) And of course Vasumatibehn too.
('65', 18, 2, 13, 37179) Blessings from BAPU [PS.]
('65', 18, 3, 14, 37205) It seems to me all right that Sita 4 should be given whatever [education] is possible there.
('65', 18, 3, 15, 37298) But if you send her over here I shall certainly make some arrangement.

('65', 18, 9, 22, 37535) You have solved all the problems well.
('65', 18, 9, 23, 37574) It is best that the cart should move with its natural speed.

('65', 18, 9, 25, 37720) But all this rushing about is only for a while.

('65', 19, 8, 9, 38284) Your letter.
('65', 19, 8, 10, 38297) What happens after meeting Damodardas is yet to be seen.
('65', 19, 8, 11, 38354) Till then I shall remain doubt ridden.
('65', 19, 8, 12, 38393) I cannot be just either to Damodardas or to Santok 1 and others.
('65', 19, 8, 13, 38458) And now you too are involved.
('65', 19, 8, 14, 38488) Damodardas alleges that you have misunderstood him but I have no doubts about you.
('65', 19, 8, 15, 38571) My fear in respect of you is of a different kind.
('65', 19, 8, 16, 38621) You have not realized even now the value of money.
('65', 19, 8, 17, 38672) In spite of your renunciation, your mind is still that of a moneyed man and not averse to possession.
('65', 19, 8, 18, 38774) An action performed without the prompting of the heart loses all its value.

('65', 20, 3, 6, 39255) I can certainly read all your letters with ease.
('65', 20, 3, 7, 39304) I have nothing to say if Ramdas himself desires to be released from your care.
('65', 20, 3, 8, 39383) In that case you have to come here.
('65', 20, 3, 9, 39419) I have no idea what is happening there.
('65', 20, 3, 10, 39459) What is Ba doing?
('65', 20, 3, 11, 39477) What is her opinion?
('65', 20, 3, 12, 39498) It is very good that Surendra is there.
('65', 20, 3, 13, 39538) Whatever happens, you must not lose your peace of mind.
('65', 20, 3, 14, 39594) I am always aware of all the trouble you have taken for Ramdas.
('65', 20, 3, 15, 39658) And, as a matter of fact, Ramdas had not been instrumental in your coming to me.
('65', 20, 3, 16, 39739) That was on account of your nature cure.
('65', 20, 3, 17, 39780) Therefore all that we want to do in that respect still remains to be done.
('65', 20, 3, 18, 39855) We shall discuss it when we meet.
('65', 20, 3, 19, 39889) I am returning your letter but not Jamnalalji’s which I am destroying.

('65', 21, 7, 11, 40992) While looking for something else which I found I came upon your letter of July 21. This could have reached me only during my travels.
('65', 21, 7, 12, 41126) I had read it and put it away in a special place in order to answer it, thereby defeating that very purpose.
('65', 21, 7, 13, 41235) I hope it is not too late even now to answer.
('65', 21, 7, 14, 41281) You can come whenever you wish and stay as long as you like.
('65', 21, 7, 15, 41342) I like your opposition.
('65', 21, 7, 16, 41366) This has never been a ground for keeping you away and it cannot be such now.
('65', 21, 7, 17, 41443) Inform me of the date of your arrival.
('65', 21, 7, 18, 41482) I take it you only want to be with me, but you must not take much of my time as I can spare very little of that commodity.

('65', 22, 7, 9, 42203) BHAI RAJENDRA PRASAD,
('65', 22, 8, 10, 42225) I sent through Mahadev the reply to your wire, which Prabhavati must have given you.
('65', 22, 8, 11, 42310) Later your letter also arrived.
('65', 22, 8, 12, 42342) I have no recollection whether I replied to your first letter through someone or whether it remained unanswered.
('65', 22, 8, 13, 42455) These days the work is quite pressing, some rest is also needed.
('65', 22, 8, 14, 42520) It does not seem proper to make Abdul Ghaffar Khan the President this time.
('65', 22, 8, 15, 42596) He is a good man and is full of love for the country.
('65', 22, 8, 16, 42650) He is sincere and self sacrificing.
('65', 22, 8, 17, 42686) But he has little experience of the Congress and the session this time involves great responsibility.
('65', 22, 8, 18, 42788) Among the men devoted to truth and non violence and commanding popularity I see none but you or Rajagopalachari or Jairamdas.
('65', 22, 8, 19, 42914) But these two men cannot now be chosen and that leaves only you.
('65', 22, 8, 20, 42979) Moreover, there is no other choice because of your contribution to the earthquake [relief] work.
('65', 22, 8, 21, 43076) You have illness in the family as also your financial problem; but are you a family man any more?
('65', 22, 8, 22, 43174) In other words, you can serve the family only so far as it is a part of the people at large.
('65', 22, 8, 23, 43267) The financial problem is almost solved.

('65', 23, 1, 3, 43559) Come with more time on hand if it is possible to stay over for a few days.
('65', 23, 1, 4, 43634) Anyway I shall be happy with whatever time you can give me.
('65', 23, 1, 5, 43694) If the date is fixed for certain I shall try to call Sardar too.
('65', 23, 1, 6, 43759) You can in no case go to Bombay before October 20. The Khan Brothers will be here during this period and we shall send for any others if their presence is required.
('65', 23, 1, 7, 43924) You must have seen my statement 1 in the papers.
('65', 23, 1, 8, 43973) The relations between Prabhavati and Jayaprakash have to be clarified.
('65', 23, 1, 9, 44044) Arrangements have been made for her to serve in Wardha but I sent her away on receiving a telegram from Jayaprakash.

('65', 23, 7, 16, 44388) I have your letter.
('65', 23, 7, 17, 44408) I am glad that you have such a brilliant prospect in front of you.
('65', 23, 7, 18, 44475) There can be no question of my asking you to retire at this stage.
('65', 23, 7, 19, 44542) Retirement can only be in those places where there is demonstrably no chance of success.
('65', 23, 7, 20, 44631) And in any case these things are not regulated by me.
('65', 23, 7, 21, 44685) They are regulated by the Parliamentary Board.
('65', 23, 7, 22, 44732) You need, therefore, have no fear of being abruptly asked by me to retire.
('65', 23, 7, 23, 44807) You need not be disturbed by my forthcoming talk with Bapuji Aney.

('65', 24, 3, 4, 45197) DEAR SISTER,
('65', 24, 4, 5, 45210) I have your touching letter.
('65', 24, 4, 6, 45239) If Pierre Ceresole 1 comes from Europe with his contingent, I would certainly like you to join him.
('65', 24, 4, 7, 45339) I do not like the idea otherwise of your going anywhere, for it will be cruel to expect you to lead the life of the poor, and it will be unfair to the people to put you in a place where they will think that they have to give you more attention than what they are to expect from you.

('65', 24, 8, 18, 46116) MY DEAR MATTY,
('65', 24, 9, 19, 46131) I was talking today with Shyamjibhai about you.
('65', 24, 9, 20, 46179) He tells me that something would be presently fixed up.
('65', 24, 9, 21, 46235) But he raises one question.
('65', 24, 9, 22, 46263) He asked me whether you, though a Christian, would be taking charge of Harijan boys and girls and inculcating in them respect for Hinduism and teaching them the principles regarding Hindu religion to be as true as Christianity.
('65', 24, 9, 23, 46491) I have told him without any hesitation that you are a liberal minded Christian and that your Christianity is not exclusive but inclusive of all the other great religions.
('65', 24, 9, 24, 46662) Am I not right?

('65', 25, 7, 8, 47026) PADMA 1,
('65', 25, 8, 9, 47035) I got your letter.
('65', 25, 8, 10, 47054) For you I have preserved such coloured sheets.
('65', 25, 8, 11, 47101) Another such girl is Durga 2. For her also I preserve coloured sheets.
('65', 25, 8, 12, 47172) I do not remember to have omitted to reply to any letter of yours.
('65', 25, 8, 13, 47239) You will be surprised to know that these days I hardly get time to speak even to the girls here.
('65', 25, 8, 14, 47336) Girls like you who are away get an occasional letter at least.
('65', 25, 8, 15, 47399) These girls don’t get even that.
('65', 25, 8, 16, 47432) Do you still envy them?
('65', 25, 8, 17, 47456) If your Magan spinning wheel 3 is out of order, why don’t you get it repaired?
('65', 25, 8, 18, 47535) What has gone wrong?
('65', 25, 8, 19, 47556) Why can’t slivers be made there?
('65', 25, 8, 20, 47589) You must also pray regularly.
('65', 25, 8, 21, 47619) If stray cattle get into our fields, we should inform their owners and ask them to make good the damage.
('65', 25, 8, 22, 47724) If they don’t listen and the cattle come again, we may certainly have them impounded.
('65', 25, 8, 23, 47810) If this involves the taint of violence, we should not mind being guilty of it.
('65', 25, 8, 24, 47889) He who is wise will deduce from this that he should own nothing.
('65', 25, 8, 25, 47954) He will have no need, then, to impound other people’s cattle for his own benefit.

('65', 28, 1, 5, 51317) Nor have I expressed pain to anybody with regard to giving away the books.
('65', 28, 1, 6, 51392) The only question can be, and is, not to do anything which might be improper.

('65', 28, 8, 19, 52061) Read it and think over it.
('65', 28, 8, 20, 52088) The letter seems very good to me.
('65', 28, 8, 21, 52122) If Harilal has changed as much as he seems to have done, it would be a great thing.
('65', 28, 8, 22, 52206) You may think about it now.
('65', 28, 8, 23, 52234) Can he be given some work connected with khadi or Harijan uplift?

('65', 28, 8, 27, 52467) He can be given khadi work only after consulting Ramjibhai.
('65', 28, 8, 28, 52527) Harijan work can be given after consulting Jivanlal or Nanalal.

('65', 31, 3, 5, 55705) Without entering into the argument, I give you my replies to your questions.
('65', 31, 3, 6, 55782) 1. When a man wears clothes made of khadi as a matter of habit, he is a habitual wearer.
('65', 31, 3, 7, 55871) If, therefore, for any just cause he cannot use khadi on some occasions, he does not cease to be a habitual wearer.
('65', 31, 3, 8, 55987) 2. But if a person appears at Congress functions in clothes not made of khadi, he will be presumed not to be a habitual wearer of khadi.
('65', 31, 3, 9, 56124) 3. Habitual wear of clothes made of khadi means all clothes from top to toe made of hand spun and hand woven khadi.
('65', 31, 3, 10, 56240) 4. When it is pointed out to the Chair or when the Chairman of a Congress meeting himself knows that a voter or a candidate is not wearing khadi clothes at that meeting, he is bound to rule that the person is not a habitual wearer in spite of his protestation to the contrary.

('65', 32, 1, 3, 57347) I am not aware that he ever abused the confidence by publishing anything and saying that the information was absolutely reliable, as it undoubtedly was.
('65', 32, 1, 4, 57500) Even Salivati 1 who, in Rangaswamy’s time, had committed a serious blunder, 2 has very often got from me information and therefore absolutely reliable.
('65', 32, 1, 5, 57652) But he observed the law of the game by not disclosing it when he knew that I did not want the information to be published.
('65', 32, 1, 6, 57775) I should not have asked Mahadev to write to you the letter he did if it was a mere matter of embarrassment to me.
('65', 32, 1, 7, 57889) There was none.
('65', 32, 1, 8, 57905) But undoubtedly public cause was damaged by your publication of information that was strictly confidential, more so as it was not even accurate.
('65', 32, 1, 9, 58050) Had it not been for the dangerous statement that the cause of the contemplated retirement was the formation of the Malaviyaji party, I would not have taken any public notice of your announcement.
('65', 32, 2, 10, 58246) I wish I could convince you that you had laid down a most dangerous principle of conduct.
('65', 32, 2, 11, 58336) You say “in this instance, therefore, our sole anxiety was about the authenticity of the news”.
('65', 32, 2, 12, 58432) Suppose that the Sardar had contemplated some big move on behalf of the Congress whose premature publication would defeat the very end he had in view.
('65', 32, 2, 13, 58583) Suppose that a very clever correspondent of The Hindu was a thought reader, and he had read the Sardar’s thought.
('65', 32, 2, 14, 58697) The news would be authentic.
('65', 32, 2, 15, 58726) Would you be justified, unless you avowed yourself as an enemy of the Congress, in publishing the authentic information?
('65', 32, 2, 16, 58847) Don’t retort by saying that no such calamity was possible in connection with your publication of the news in question.
('65', 32, 2, 17, 58966) I am trying to show you the untenability of the position you have taken up.
('65', 32, 2, 18, 59042) That the publication in the case in point did not result in much damage, you could not plead in self protection.
('65', 32, 2, 19, 59155) You will, therefore, please dismiss from your mind the idea that you have done any wrong to me.
('65', 32, 2, 20, 59251) I have endeavoured to appreciate your point of view.
('65', 32, 2, 21, 59304) It is unfortunate that I have not been able to appreciate your position.
('65', 32, 2, 22, 59377) I think that it is wholly indefensible, unless of course you take up the position that, as a newspaper man, you have nothing to do with the nation, your sole concern is to purvey news—no matter how obtained

('65', 33, 14, 23, 60558) Your letter has put heart into me.
('65', 33, 14, 24, 60593) But if it has done that, it has also led to a discovery.
('65', 33, 14, 25, 60650) You are all a fraud and Raihana the greatest among you all.
('65', 33, 14, 26, 60710) I never knew that in writing those long letters she was simply joking and pretending.
('65', 33, 14, 27, 60796) And instead of remaining a Bhrrr— you a grey bearded young man writes to me a serious letter as if the whole bungalow was flooded with tears.
('65', 33, 14, 28, 60938) I shall know what to do when next time she sends me a long complaint.
('65', 33, 14, 29, 61008) Of course she could not write the letter she did if there was all that she said in her letters about your wickednesses.

('65', 34, 13, 19, 61749) If you wish you may of course keep Kano 4 with you, what have I to do with him if I bring him here?
('65', 34, 13, 20, 61849) My only intention was to relieve you and Ramdas of responsibility for him.
('65', 34, 13, 21, 61924) Nimu 5 was enthusiastic about Kano because Sarita 6 is here.
('65', 34, 13, 22, 61985) It appears Ramdas is now steadily improving.
('65', 34, 13, 23, 62030) He must not hasten to resume his food.
('65', 34, 13, 24, 62069) You must be having mosquito net with you.

('65', 35, 7, 10, 62902) BHAI PARIKSHITLAL,
('65', 35, 8, 11, 62921) I have your letter.
('65', 35, 8, 12, 62941) It is difficult to give a reply which can be universally applied, to the question what should be done when a Harijan living in the Ashram misbehaves.
('65', 35, 8, 13, 63091) You yourself will have to decide that.
('65', 35, 8, 14, 63130) Or Narahari will do so when he comes.
('65', 35, 8, 15, 63168) How to find a way between the duty of forbearance on the one hand and that of protecting the Ashram on the other can be decided only with reference to each particular incident.
('65', 35, 8, 16, 63345) Adopt whatever course experience suggests without any fear or hesitation.
('65', 35, 8, 17, 63419) Such a rule cannot be applied to a caste Hindu nor to a responsible Harijan living in the Ashram.
('65', 35, 8, 18, 63517) And I am firmly of the view that nothing can be forgiven those who are responsible for the management of the Ashram.
('65', 35, 8, 19, 63634) If moral laxity enters their lives, institutions of Harijan service will perish.
('65', 35, 8, 20, 63715) I am afraid I have not been able to give a reply which will satisfy you.
('65', 35, 8, 21, 63788) Find what guidance you can from this.

('65', 36, 12, 21, 64627) But there has been no deliberate malice behind what has happened.
('65', 36, 12, 22, 64693) There is nothing but misunderstanding at the bottom of the whole thing.

('65', 36, 12, 25, 64851) I have decided that, if Kaka can be persuaded, he must not leave Gujarat at present so as to end all this bitterness, if for no other reason.
('65', 36, 12, 26, 64993) Let him manage or mismanage the education department of the whole country from Gujarat.

('65', 37, 1, 7, 65751) If anybody consults someone whom he admires, it will be only as a friend.
('65', 37, 1, 8, 65825) This is the plan I have in mind.
('65', 37, 1, 9, 65858) I have discussed this scheme at length with Kaka, Kishorelal and Narahari.
('65', 37, 1, 10, 65933) If you approve of it, all that you have to do is to write a letter and put it into operation.
('65', 37, 1, 11, 66027) About salaries, Narahari and Kaka have decided something.
('65', 37, 1, 12, 66085) I have not meddled in that.

('65', 37, 4, 22, 66675) Draupadi’s letter leads me to believe that it would be a sin on your part to stay away from her.
('65', 37, 4, 23, 66772) Your first duty is to look after Devi 2. But it might be proper to leave him in Delhi if his care is beyond you.

('65', 38, 9, 18, 68055) As a result of mutual conversation we have come to the conclusion that it should be common cause between the Parliamentary Board and the Nationalist Party 2 that wheresoever between rival candidates it is manifest that one candidate has an overwhelming chance against another the latter should be withdrawn.
('65', 38, 9, 19, 68363) Not having sufficient material before us, it was not possible to make any recommendation as to the chances of success of rival candidates whose names were before us.

('65', 39, 4, 7, 69192) [Before September 21, 1934]
('65', 39, 5, 8, 69220) [GANDHIJI:] So you wanted to take the citadel by storm?
('65', 39, 6, 9, 69276) [AKARTE:] Yes, rather.
('65', 39, 6, 10, 69299) But the preacher is a believer in the removal of untouchability, and I had told the Secretary that he should hold the kirtan in a temple which was open to the Harijans.
('65', 39, 6, 11, 69468) You did not approach the preacher himself?
('65', 39, 7, 12, 69511) No, Sir.
('65', 39, 8, 13, 69520) The preacher himself had no prejudice against the Harijans, for, you yourself say he went to the Harijan quarters and gave them a kirtan?
('65', 39, 9, 14, 69658) He had no prejudices, but he should not have yielded to the Secretary.
('65', 39, 9, 15, 69729) You know that the temple was not open to the Harijans, and you laid yourself open to the charge that you wanted to go in under cover of the kirtan?
('65', 39, 10, 16, 69877) But, Mahatmaji, he might have come out and held the kirtan outside.
('65', 39, 10, 17, 69945) But he did go to the Harijan quarters.
('65', 39, 10, 18, 69984) Didn’t he?
('65', 39, 11, 19, 69995) But the handbills invited all the Hindus.
('65', 39, 11, 20, 70037) Quite right.
('65', 39, 11, 21, 70050) But the preacher had not issued the leaflets, and, then, “all” means, in our present state of unenlightenment, the so called Hindus, and does not include the Harijans.
('65', 39, 12, 22, 70218) Mahatmaji, the Hindu Sabha Secretary ought to know better.
('65', 39, 13, 23, 70277) 1 Reported by Mahadev Desai, this appeared in Harijan under the title “The Wrong Way”.
('65', 39, 13, 24, 70364) The Hindu Sabha of Morsi, in C. P., had arranged with one of its preachers to hold a kirtan and issued handbills inviting Hindus.
('65', 39, 13, 25, 70494) The kirtan was held in a temple where Akarte, a Harijan worker, and other Harijans were not allowed.
('65', 39, 13, 26, 70595) The preacher also declined to hold the kirtan outside for the benefit of the Harijans but offered to go to the Harijan quarters and give them a special kirtan.
('65', 39, 13, 27, 70755) Akarte later held a protest meeting and passed a resolution condemning the preacher.
('65', 39, 13, 28, 70840) Akarte then sought Gandhiji’s guidance.
('65', 40, 0, 1, 70880) VOL. 65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 41
('65', 40, 1, 2, 70930) Well, well, no legal quibbles.
('65', 40, 1, 3, 70961) There ought not to have been a protest meeting, at all.
('65', 40, 1, 4, 71017) You might have approached the preacher in the first instance, you might have gently asked him to address a meeting of the Hindus for the removal of untouchability or to appeal to the Hindus in the course of his kirtan itself to admit the Harijans to a religious function to which they had every right.
('65', 40, 1, 5, 71319) You might have asked the other Hindus to boycott the function altogether.
('65', 40, 1, 6, 71393) Even now, if you have sufficient energy in you, you may serve on the temple trustees notice asking them to show cause why they prevented Harijans from entering even the precincts of the temple and thus from listening to a religious sermon.
('65', 40, 1, 7, 71633) That would be a good test case; whilst temple entry may be prohibited in law, entry into the precincts may not be.
('65', 40, 1, 8, 71748) But the protest meeting and the other things you did were, perhaps, an exhibition of excessive zeal.
('65', 40, 1, 9, 71849) The method of our work is unadulterated non violence, and non violence alone will succeed.
('65', 40, 1, 10, 71940) Force is sure to fail.
('65', 40, 2, 11, 71963) I am sorry, Mahatmaji; I must confess I was in a temper.
('65', 40, 2, 12, 72020) If you like, I can make a public statement to that effect.
('65', 40, 3, 13, 72079) That is hardly necessary.
('65', 40, 3, 14, 72105) Your restraint in action will be more eloquent than any expression of regret.
('65', 40, 4, 15, 72183) Though cholera is fast disappearing in Malkapur and Morsi, 1 there are other villages where it has spread and might spread.
('65', 40, 4, 16, 72307) What precautionary measures would you suggest?
('65', 40, 4, 17, 72354) Could we take the help of the police in a crisis like this?
('65', 40, 5, 18, 72414) Certainly, police help may be taken, as medical help is taken.
('65', 40, 5, 19, 72477) All drinking water must be boiled (and a grain of potassium permanganate should be added to it.
('65', 40, 5, 20, 72573) They must be asked not to drink any other water.
('65', 40, 6, 21, 72622) But they are ignorant, they don’t listen.
('65', 40, 6, 22, 72664) And how can we expect the poor people to drink boiled water, when they go to the fields.
('65', 40, 7, 23, 72753) Now, that’s not an active worker speaking!
('65', 40, 7, 24, 72796) You must carry on vigorous propaganda, provide them with every facility and not rest until they have listened to you.
('65', 40, 7, 25, 72914) You can provide them with extra fuel to boil the water with, pots in which to carry the boiled water to the fields and potassium permanganate.
('65', 40, 7, 26, 73057) You can have Harijans whom you have inoculated to accompany you and help in the propaganda.
('65', 40, 7, 27, 73149) No pains to be spared.
('65', 40, 8, 28, 73172) 1 The worker had described the cholera epidemic in these villages and the steps he had taken to control it.
('65', 41, 0, 1, 73280) 42 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 41, 1, 2, 73321) I quite see.
('65', 41, 1, 3, 73334) I was tending a Harijan myself yesterday.
('65', 41, 1, 4, 73376) I had a medical man to treat him; he was worse, I had another doctor called and I am glad he will completely recover.
('65', 41, 1, 5, 73494) He got a treatment which the richest in our village might envy.
('65', 41, 1, 6, 73558) That’s vary good.
('65', 41, 1, 7, 73576) Rest assured that your name has gone down in the book of God, who keeps an accurate record of all things good and bad.

('65', 41, 3, 10, 73754) 47. WHY AGAINST VIOLENCE?
('65', 41, 4, 11, 73780) A correspondent argues:
('65', 41, 5, 12, 73804) Why are you against violence?
('65', 41, 5, 13, 73834) Do you think that every act of violence is an expression of himsa?
('65', 41, 5, 14, 73901) Is it not strange that we should feel a kind of horror, pity and disgust when we see a murder or assassination, and silently witness the slow sucking of blood going on every day in the world?
('65', 41, 5, 15, 74093) If one believes that a successful bloody revolution would ameliorate a good deal of misery in the world, why should he not resort to arms?
('65', 41, 5, 16, 74232) Don’t you realize that the rulers of the world have become so callous that, to understand you or humanity, they must again become children.
('65', 41, 5, 17, 74372) I don’t mean to say they are born bad.
('65', 41, 5, 18, 74411) But their badness is a physical fact and, in spite of themselves, they cannot alter it.
('65', 41, 6, 19, 74499) It is because the rulers, if they are bad, are so, not neces sarily or wholly by reason of birth, but largely because of their environment, that I have hopes of their altering their course.
('65', 41, 6, 20, 74689) It is perfectly true, as the writer says, that the rulers cannot alter their course themselves.
('65', 41, 6, 21, 74785) If they are dominated by their environment, they do not surely deserve to be killed, but should be changed by a change of environment.
('65', 41, 6, 22, 74920) But the environment are we—the people who make the rulers what they are.
('65', 41, 6, 23, 74993) They are thus an exaggerated editon of what we are in the aggregate.
('65', 41, 6, 24, 75062) If my argument is sound, any violence done to the rulers would be violence done to ourselves.
('65', 41, 6, 25, 75156) It would be suicide.
('65', 41, 6, 26, 75177) And since I do not want to commit suicide, nor encourage my neighbours to do so, I become non violent myself and invite my neighbours to do likewise.
('65', 41, 6, 27, 75327) Moreover, violence may destroy one or more bad rulers, but, like Ravana’s heads, others will pop up in their places, for, the root lies elsewhere.
('65', 41, 6, 28, 75474) It lies in us.
('65', 41, 6, 29, 75489) If we will reform ourselves, the rulers will automatically do so.
('65', 41, 6, 30, 75555) The correspondent seems to imagine that a non violent person
('65', 42, 0, 1, 75616) VOL. 65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 43
('65', 42, 1, 2, 75666) has no feelings and that he is a silent witness to the “slow sucking of blood going on every day in the world”.
('65', 42, 1, 3, 75778) Non violence is not a passive force nor so helpless as the correspondent will make it out to be.
('65', 42, 1, 4, 75875) Barring truth, if truth is to be considered apart from non violence, the latter is the activest force in the world.
('65', 42, 1, 5, 75991) It never fails.
('65', 42, 1, 6, 76007) Violence only seemingly succeeds, and nobody has ever claimed uniform success for violence.
('65', 42, 1, 7, 76099) Non violence never promises immediate and tangible results.
('65', 42, 1, 8, 76159) It is not a mango trick.
('65', 42, 1, 9, 76184) Its failures are, therefore, all seeming.
('65', 42, 1, 10, 76226) A believer in violence will kill the murderer and boast of his act.
('65', 42, 1, 11, 76294) But he never killed murder.
('65', 42, 1, 12, 76322) By murdering the murderer, he added to it and probably invited more.
('65', 42, 1, 13, 76391) The law of retaliation is the law of multiplying evil.
('65', 42, 1, 14, 76446) A non violent man will act upon the murderer through his love.
('65', 42, 1, 15, 76509) He cannot, by punishing the murderer, undo the murder already committed.
('65', 42, 1, 16, 76582) But he hopes by gentleness to get the murderer to repent of his deed and change the whole course of his life.
('65', 42, 1, 17, 76692) A non violent man always and automatically turns the searchlight selfward and discovers that the best course of conduct is to do unto others as he would have others to do unto him.
('65', 42, 1, 18, 76873) If he was the murderer, he would not like to be killed for his madness but would like the opportunity of mending himself.
('65', 42, 1, 19, 76995) He knows, too, that he must not destroy what he cannot create.
('65', 42, 1, 20, 77058) God is the sole Judge between man and man.

('65', 42, 3, 22, 77120) 48. GOD OR NO GOD
('65', 42, 4, 23, 77138) During my visit to the South I met Harijans and others who pretended not to believe in God.
('65', 42, 4, 24, 77230) At one place where a conference of Harijans was being held, the chairman delivered a harangue on atheism under the very shadow of a temple which Harijans had built for themselves with their own money.
('65', 42, 4, 25, 77431) But out of the bitterness of his heart for the treatment meted out to fellow Harijans, he had begun to doubt the very existence of a benevolent Power that had allowed such cruelty to flourish.
('65', 42, 4, 26, 77624) There was, perhaps, some excuse for this disbelief.
('65', 42, 4, 27, 77676) But here is a specimen of disbelief of another type from another source:
('65', 42, 5, 28, 77749) Don’t you think that a preconceived idea of a God, Truth or Reality
('65', 43, 0, 1, 77817) 44 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 43, 1, 2, 77858) might colour the whole trend of our search and hence be a great impediment and may defeat the very purpose of our life?
('65', 43, 1, 3, 77978) For example, you take certain moral truths as fundamental.
('65', 43, 1, 4, 78037) But we are in search and, as long as we have not found the reality, how can we boast or assert that a certain rule of morality is the truth or it alone.
('65', 43, 1, 5, 78190) is going to help us in our search.
('65', 43, 2, 6, 78225) No search is possible without some workable assumptions.
('65', 43, 2, 7, 78282) If we grant nothing, we find nothing.
('65', 43, 2, 8, 78320) Ever since its commencement, the world, the wise and the foolish included, has proceeded upon the assumption that, if we are, God is and that, if God is not, we are not.
('65', 43, 2, 9, 78490) And since belief in God is co existent with the humankind, existence of God is treated as a fact more definite than the fact that the sun is.
('65', 43, 2, 10, 78632) This living faith has solved the largest number of puzzles of life.
('65', 43, 2, 11, 78700) It has alleviated our misery.
('65', 43, 2, 12, 78730) It sustains us in life, it is our one solace in death.
('65', 43, 2, 13, 78785) The very search for Truth becomes interesting, worth while, because of this belief.
('65', 43, 2, 14, 78869) But search for Truth is search for God.
('65', 43, 2, 15, 78909) Truth is God.
('65', 43, 2, 16, 78923) God is, because Truth is.
('65', 43, 2, 17, 78949) We embark upon the search, because we believe that there is Truth and that It can be found by diligent search and meticulous observance of the wellknown and well tried rules of the search.
('65', 43, 2, 18, 79138) There is no record in history of the failure of such search.
('65', 43, 2, 19, 79199) Even the atheists who have pretended to disbelieve in God have believed in Truth.
('65', 43, 2, 20, 79281) The trick they have performed is that of giving God another, not a new, name.
('65', 43, 2, 21, 79359) His names are Legion.
('65', 43, 2, 22, 79381) Truth is the crown of them all.
('65', 43, 2, 23, 79413) What is true of God is true, though in a less degree, of the ‘assumption of the truth of some fundamental moralities’.
('65', 43, 2, 24, 79532) As a matter of fact, they are implied in the belief in God or Truth.
('65', 43, 2, 25, 79601) Departure from these has landed the truants in endless misery.
('65', 43, 2, 26, 79664) Difficulty of practice should not be confused with disbelief.
('65', 43, 2, 27, 79726) A Himalayan expedition has its prescribed conditions of success.
('65', 43, 2, 28, 79791) Difficulty of fulfilling the conditions does not make the expedition impossible.
('65', 43, 2, 29, 79872) It only adds interest and zest to the search.
('65', 43, 2, 30, 79918) Well, this expedition in search of God or Truth is infinitely more than numberless Himalayan expeditions and, therefore, much more interesting.
('65', 43, 2, 31, 80062) If we have no zest for it, it is because of the weakness of our faith.
('65', 43, 2, 32, 80133) What we see with our physical eyes is more real to us than the only Reality.
('65', 43, 2, 33, 80210) We know that appearances are deceptive.
('65', 43, 2, 34, 80250) And yet we treat trivialities as realities.
('65', 43, 2, 35, 80294) To see the trivialities as such is half the battle won.
('65', 43, 2, 36, 80350) It constitutes more than half the search after Truth or God.
('65', 43, 2, 37, 80411) Unless we disengage ourselves
('65', 44, 0, 1, 80441) VOL. 65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 45
('65', 44, 1, 2, 80491) from trivialities, we have not even the leisure for the great search; Or is it to be reserved for our leisure hours?
('65', 44, 1, 3, 80608) Let Harijan workers know that the campaign against untouchability is a part of the great search, whether we know it or not.
('65', 44, 1, 4, 80732) Untouchability is a big falsehood.
('65', 44, 1, 5, 80767) We have proved it for ourselves, or we should not be devotees of the cause.
('65', 44, 1, 6, 80843) We can transmit the truth to others only by diligence and due observance of the conditions of success which have been often enough set forth in these columns.

('65', 44, 11, 15, 81201) DEAR FRIEND,
('65', 44, 12, 16, 81214) I have your letter of 26th July last.
('65', 44, 12, 17, 81252) The Indian movement stands for complete independence.
('65', 44, 12, 18, 81306) That does not exclude an honourable partnership on absolutely equal terms.
('65', 44, 12, 19, 81381) But there can be no association with imperialist exploitation of India or any other country.
('65', 44, 12, 20, 81474) Naturally you have heard the opinion that India could not be left on its own.
('65', 44, 12, 21, 81552) Imperialism has always justified itself in that manner.
('65', 44, 12, 22, 81608) I believe in the maxim that no greater evil can befall a country than that it should lose its independence.
('65', 44, 12, 23, 81716) The caste system, as it exists at present, is certainly the bane of Hindu life.
('65', 44, 12, 24, 81796) Its rigour is unmitigated by the British rule.

('65', 45, 7, 11, 82315) MY DEAR SASTRI 1,
('65', 45, 8, 12, 82333) Prithuraj tells me that he wrote to you about some account in connection with Harijan.
('65', 45, 8, 13, 82420) Is Ganesan up to date in his accountkeeping?
('65', 45, 8, 14, 82465) Are you keeping an eye on it?
('65', 45, 8, 15, 82495) You know how particular I am about prompt attention to all matters referring to account keeping.
('65', 45, 8, 16, 82592) There is a small subscription received here.
('65', 45, 8, 17, 82637) Prithuraj will be writing about it.
('65', 45, 8, 18, 82673) It is a matter of debit and credit entry.
('65', 45, 8, 19, 82715) I would like you to examine the ledger keeping and give me your personal assurance that everything is kept in order.
('65', 45, 8, 20, 82832) Though I like Ganesan for his energy and enthusiasm, I have never been an admirer of his businesslikeness.
('65', 45, 8, 21, 82939) On the contrary I have had sad experiences.
('65', 45, 8, 22, 82983) But I have nursed him because I have believed in his integrity.

('65', 46, 9, 15, 83854) It is difficult for me to say anything till you have passed through the usual channels.

('65', 47, 2, 3, 84170) September 21, 1934
('65', 47, 3, 4, 84189) MY DEAR JUGALKISHORE, Your letter and statement to hand.
('65', 47, 3, 5, 84246) (1) It is no use my making any public statement.
('65', 47, 3, 6, 84295) If you are not going to rejoin the institution, you and those who hold the same view should publicly announce your intention of not rejoining, in any case stating definitely that you would not because of your past political activity and to save the institution from remaining under the ban if your past activity had any connection with the continuance of the ban.
('65', 47, 3, 7, 84659) I think too that it is open to the trustees to move the H. C for an order compelling the Government to lift the ban.
('65', 47, 3, 8, 84776) But that is a purely legal point on which they should take legal advice.
('65', 47, 3, 9, 84849) The trustees should consult Sir Tej, if they have access to him.
('65', 47, 3, 10, 84914) He may give legal advice and also move the Government in his capacity as a public man.
('65', 47, 3, 11, 85001) (2) You can come whenever you like next month.
('65', 47, 3, 12, 85048) I am in Wardha till 19th October.
('65', 47, 3, 13, 85082) I shall give you some time for the discussion of education in general and village education in particular.
('65', 47, 3, 14, 85189) You may come even earlier, if you want to see Kakasaheb too in the matter.
('65', 47, 3, 15, 85264) He is here at present.
('65', 47, 3, 16, 85287) He is laid up with fever which is slowly going down.
('65', 47, 4, 17, 85340) Yours, BAPU

('65', 47, 8, 22, 85471) BA, No letter from you today.
('65', 47, 8, 23, 85501) You will learn the news about Sumitra from my letter to Ramdas.
('65', 47, 8, 24, 85565) You must not worry on her account nor on Nimu’s.
('65', 47, 8, 25, 85614) Amtussalaam and Vasumati go there regularly.
('65', 47, 8, 26, 85659) Radhakisan 1
('65', 47, 9, 27, 85672) is there, of course.
('65', 47, 9, 28, 85693) Amala has secured a job in Santiniketan and will leave in a few days.
('65', 47, 9, 29, 85763) She is very happy about it.
('65', 47, 9, 30, 85791) Kakasahep was having a temperature but it is coming down gradually.

('65', 48, 1, 3, 85971) Nimu of course accompanies me part of the way and again joins me on my return.
('65', 48, 1, 4, 86050) She is now learning to spin by herself.
('65', 48, 1, 5, 86090) I have today a letter from Jamnabehn.
('65', 48, 1, 6, 86128) I hope you write to her.
('65', 48, 1, 7, 86153) Do write to Mani also.

('65', 48, 4, 10, 86263) September 21, 1934
('65', 48, 5, 11, 86282) JAMNALAL,
('65', 48, 6, 12, 86292) As the doctor here confessed his helplessness regarding Sumitra’s eyes and advised her to be immediately taken to Bombay, I have sent her with Saritabehn.
('65', 48, 6, 13, 86447) I have asked her to stay in Mani Bhuvan.
('65', 48, 6, 14, 86488) The responsibility of finding the doctor rests on Sardar.
('65', 48, 6, 15, 86546) You will not have to worry.
('65', 48, 6, 16, 86574) However, they will come and see you.
('65', 48, 6, 17, 86611) Let not the repeated postponement of your return worry you.
('65', 48, 6, 18, 86671) Come only when the doctor declares it safe.
('65', 48, 6, 19, 86715) Till then let there be no burden on your mind concerning the affairs here.
('65', 48, 6, 20, 86790) Most probably Madan Mohan 1 will leave today.
('65', 48, 6, 21, 86836) The Khan Brothers are quite comfortable.
('65', 48, 6, 22, 86877) The younger brother is learning hand spinning and the elder looks after Jones and Kaka.
('65', 48, 6, 23, 86965) There is no need to worry about them.
('65', 48, 6, 24, 87003) Radhakisan is an efficient worker.
('65', 48, 6, 25, 87038) I hope you follow the rules of diet suggested [by me].
('65', 48, 6, 26, 87093) What is your weight?
('65', 48, 6, 27, 87114) Has Ghanshyamdas’s operation been put off?

('65', 49, 2, 3, 87339) [September 21, 1934] 1
('65', 49, 3, 4, 87362) JAMNALAL,
('65', 49, 4, 5, 87372) You probably remember a sum of Rs. 500 having been paid to Madhavdas, Ba’s brother.
('65', 49, 4, 6, 87456) He duly got the money.
('65', 49, 4, 7, 87479) Of the total amount, Rs. 325 was paid at the time through Thakkar Bapa and the balance seems to have been drawn from the firm’s office.
('65', 49, 4, 8, 87615) That sum of Rs. 325 should now be returned to Thakkar Bapa.
('65', 49, 4, 9, 87675) Send him a hundi for this amount.
('65', 49, 4, 10, 87709) Particulars: ‘In repayment of Rs. 325 paid to Gandhi in Bombay.’ And now about Madan Mohan.
('65', 49, 4, 11, 87801) I thought he would leave today for.
('65', 49, 4, 12, 87837) Bombay.
('65', 49, 4, 13, 87845) But now that will not be possible.
('65', 49, 4, 14, 87880) The Khan Brothers seem to need him here, though they said so only jokingly.
('65', 49, 4, 15, 87956) They might give Madan Mohan some writing work, and would also like somebody whom they knew to accompany them everywhere.
('65', 49, 4, 16, 88077) If you don’t specially need Madan Mohan there, let him remain here for the present.
('65', 49, 4, 17, 88161) Or if you can think of somebody else to take his place, let me know.
('65', 49, 4, 18, 88230) Even if, however, you cannot do that and if you need Madan Mohan, I will send him immediately.
('65', 49, 4, 19, 88325) In any case I will discuss the matter with them tomorrow.
('65', 49, 4, 20, 88383) Radhakisan must have written to you about Manhar Singh.
('65', 49, 5, 21, 88439) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] Rajendrababu is arriving on Monday or Tuesday.
('65', 49, 5, 22, 88512) Andrews also will be arriving at the same time.

('65', 50, 2, 3, 88784) September 21, 1934
('65', 50, 3, 4, 88803) GHHAGANLAL,
('65', 50, 4, 5, 88815) I got your letter.
('65', 50, 4, 6, 88834) I should say ‘letters’ rather.
('65', 50, 4, 7, 88865) I got your statement.
('65', 50, 4, 8, 88887) You have fought well.
('65', 50, 4, 9, 88909) Try and see if you can fight in Lakhtar 1 now.
('65', 50, 4, 10, 88956) If you can find anybody there who knows the Lakhtar ruler, use his good offices.
('65', 50, 4, 11, 89037) Parikshitlal must have written to you about this.
('65', 50, 4, 12, 89087) I can understand that you cannot become a permanent secretary till you have come to like the place.
('65', 50, 4, 13, 89187) Time and circumstances keep doing their work.
('65', 50, 4, 14, 89233) We are ruled by them.
('65', 50, 4, 15, 89255) That is why we sing “Thy will be done.” Till a permanent advisory board can be appointed, let things go on as at present.
('65', 50, 4, 16, 89377) If you keep up the practice of consulting people in matters on which they are qualified to advise, you will be able to form from among them the kind of board you require.
('65', 50, 4, 17, 89548) The message which I have sent to workers in Gujarat is meant for all.
('65', 50, 4, 18, 89618) Whether at present there are only two or three or 20 or 30 workers who can work in that manner doesn’t worry me.
('65', 50, 4, 19, 89731) I have only presented the ideal.
('65', 50, 4, 20, 89764) We cannot revive the Vidyapith in the same form.
('65', 50, 4, 21, 89813) Circumstances have changed and we have gone through new experiences.
('65', 50, 4, 22, 89882) In the causes for despair which you have described, I see rays of hope.
('65', 50, 4, 23, 89954) What one or two persons are doing today will be taken up tomorrow by ten or twenty and by two hundred or three hundred the day after.
('65', 50, 4, 24, 90088) If, however, the experiment is not sound or if no worker of the right type has gone to any village, let it fail.
('65', 50, 4, 25, 90201) If the experiment itself is unsound, it ought to fail or it will seem to have failed for want of the right type of expert workers.
('65', 50, 4, 26, 90332) Some of us will try to make ourselves such workers.
('65', 50, 4, 27, 90384) So long as we believe that India lives in her villages and not in her cities, we must go to the villages sooner or later.
('65', 50, 4, 28, 90506) If so, why not today?
('65', 50, 4, 29, 90528) Neither Kaka nor Narahari has left the Vidyapith.
('65', 50, 4, 30, 90578) If you say that Narahari has not gone to work in a village, that would be partly true.
('65', 50, 4, 31, 90665) Anybody who lives among Harijans will be living in his mind in
('65', 50, 5, 32, 90728) 1 Where Harijans were forbidden the use of the public reservoir
('65', 51, 0, 1, 90792) 52 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 51, 1, 2, 90833) a village.
('65', 51, 1, 3, 90844) If that is not so, he wouldn’t be able to render true service to Harijans.
('65', 51, 1, 4, 90919) Where do the five or seven crores of Harijans live?
('65', 51, 1, 5, 90971) You, I, Narahari and all others should have our hearts where they live.
('65', 51, 1, 6, 91043) Kaka, too, has not left.
('65', 51, 1, 7, 91068) Because he has ceased to be a trustee, does that mean that he has left the institution?
('65', 51, 1, 8, 91156) Why shouldn’t we say, rather, that his connection with the institution has become closer?
('65', 51, 1, 9, 91246) He himself thinks so.
('65', 51, 1, 10, 91268) If you still do not understand, ask me again without the slightest hesitation.
('65', 51, 1, 11, 91347) Kaka must be in Ahmedabad at present, and Vallabhbhai in Bombay.
('65', 51, 1, 12, 91412) Swami, Kishorelal and the rest are here.
('65', 51, 1, 13, 91453) Just now Devdas too is here.
('65', 51, 1, 14, 91482) I intend to take one more step.
('65', 51, 1, 15, 91514) I am not discussing it here.
('65', 51, 1, 16, 91543) I will ask Kishorelal to write to you today about it if he can.
('65', 51, 1, 17, 91607) Please do not feel disheartened.
('65', 51, 1, 18, 91640) The examples of Bal and others show that we have to purify and strengthen our faith.
('65', 51, 1, 19, 91725) Those who desert the cause obey their own nature.
('65', 51, 1, 20, 91775) We need not lament what they do.
('65', 51, 1, 21, 91808) I hope Rama 1, Vimu 2 and Dhiru 3 are quite well.
('65', 51, 1, 22, 91858) Where do you all stay?

('65', 51, 6, 27, 91996) BHAISHRI VALLABHBHAI, I wish to add one more to your already numerous burdens.
('65', 51, 6, 28, 92075) You will find with this the opinion of the Civil Surgeon here about Sumitra’s condition.
('65', 51, 6, 29, 92164) In view of it, I am immediately sending her there with her grandmother today.
('65', 51, 6, 30, 92242) They will stay in Mani Bhuvan, but you may keep them with you if you wish.
('65', 51, 6, 31, 92317) Get Sumitra examined and treated by an eye specialist.
('65', 51, 6, 32, 92372) She has trachoma and also astigmatism.
('65', 51, 6, 33, 92411) Both the conditions require treatment.
('65', 51, 6, 34, 92450) Mani may accompany her wherever it may be necessary to take her.
('65', 51, 6, 35, 92515) My statement is being widely criticized.
('65', 51, 6, 36, 92556) Please do create an atmosphere favourable to my leaving the Congress.

('65', 52, 1, 2, 92754) to be interested in the programme of spinning and weaving khadi, as you have rightly pointed out in your statement 1. I sent you yesterday a copy of my reply 2 to Vamanrao.
('65', 52, 1, 3, 92927) Aney came and saw me yesterday.
('65', 52, 1, 4, 92959) He spent full two hours with me.
('65', 52, 1, 5, 92992) You must have read our joint statement 3. There was a wire from Nekiram informing me that Malaviyaji was coming on the 26th.
('65', 52, 1, 6, 93117) It was received while Aney was here.
('65', 52, 1, 7, 93154) I have replied to say that Malaviyaji should not be put to the trouble of coming here, and that it would be enough if the two parties realized that whichever was likely to be defeated should withdraw.
('65', 52, 1, 8, 93355) I should certainly like Chintamani 4 and Kunzru 5 to get elected.
('65', 52, 1, 9, 93421) They are very useful persons.
('65', 52, 1, 10, 93451) I don’t know, though, how that can be assured.
('65', 52, 1, 11, 93498) How can we know what the conditions in the U.P. are?
('65', 52, 1, 12, 93551) Outside the U.P., I don’t think they will succeed anywhere.
('65', 52, 1, 13, 93611) He says that their candidates will win in Bengal.
('65', 52, 1, 14, 93661) He is also hopeful about Phukan and about a successful tour of Utkal.
('65', 52, 1, 15, 93731) Most probably they will not put up any candidate against Asaf Ali.
('65', 52, 1, 16, 93798) He told me that there was complete rot in the affairs of Bengal.
('65', 52, 1, 17, 93863) That the Congress office should be raided in broad daylight and Congress papers should be carried away was the limit.
('65', 52, 1, 18, 93981) The raiders, however, did not find the faked receipts for which they had planned the raid.
('65', 52, 1, 19, 94072) It is said that among them were some well known Congress volunteers.
('65', 52, 1, 20, 94141) Kaka’s fever has yet left him completely.

('65', 53, 3, 4, 94534) BHAI CHANDRA TYAGI, Your letter.
('65', 53, 3, 5, 94567) Besides the Gita it would be good to read the Ramayana too.
('65', 53, 3, 6, 94627) Faith coupled with knowledge sharpens the intellect which then meekly follows faith.
('65', 53, 3, 7, 94712) The letter about Mirabehn was extremely sweet.
('65', 53, 3, 8, 94759) Mirabehn is touring in the West these days for propaganda work.
('65', 53, 3, 9, 94823) She will be back by the end of October.
('65', 53, 3, 10, 94863) In karmayoga one worships only God and that too through the service of His subjects.
('65', 53, 3, 11, 94948) One who remains awake during the best part of the night is entitled to sleep during the day.
('65', 53, 3, 12, 95041) It will do if you can spin good yarn of count 20. I shall try to do something about Rajkishori 1. At present I am confining myself to Wardha.
('65', 53, 3, 13, 95183) If you wish you can come to me in January.
('65', 53, 3, 14, 95226) I have no programme fixed till then.
('65', 53, 3, 15, 95263) Ba is at Sabarmati these days with Ramdas who is unwell.
('65', 53, 3, 16, 95320) Prabhavati, Amtussalaam, Vasumati and Umiya 2 are with me, also Mahadev, Pyarelal, Raj and Prithuraj.
('65', 53, 3, 17, 95422) Amina 3 is living in her husband’s village these days.
('65', 53, 3, 18, 95477) My diet consists of milk, fruit and a boiled vegetable.
('65', 53, 3, 19, 95533) It is good to eat papaw when available.
('65', 53, 3, 20, 95573) I am keeping well.
('65', 53, 3, 21, 95592) Jamnalalji is in Bombay at present having undergone a mastoid operation.

('65', 54, 6, 7, 96118) DEAR VIDYARTHI,
('65', 54, 7, 8, 96134) Khan Saheb is most disinclined to accept public appointments.
('65', 54, 7, 9, 96196) He does only when there is no escaping from it.
('65', 54, 7, 10, 96244) He has been turning down proposal after proposal.
('65', 54, 7, 11, 96294) I would ask you to secure someone else, preferably some local man.
('65', 54, 7, 12, 96361) We should by this time learn to depend upon intrinsic merit than on extrinsic aid.
('65', 54, 8, 13, 96444) Yours sincerely,

('65', 55, 4, 9, 96830) But I do not need to say anything as I understand that the whole thing was due to an error which has been, or is being, rectified.

('65', 55, 10, 17, 97121) MY DEAR BISHVA NATH,
('65', 55, 11, 18, 97142) I received only today your letter addressed to Deenabandhu Andrews.
('65', 55, 11, 19, 97210) He had forgotten all about it.
('65', 55, 11, 20, 97241) I do not know whether your wife has met the expected fate, or whether she is still lingering.
('65', 55, 11, 21, 97335) I shall be in Wardha till the middle of October.
('65', 55, 11, 22, 97384) You are at liberty, therefore, to come to Wardha between now and then.
('65', 55, 11, 23, 97455) I do hope that you are now in comparatively greater peace than when you wrote your letter to the Deenabandhu.

('65', 56, 2, 3, 97786) September 22, 1934
('65', 56, 3, 4, 97805) PANDITJI,
('65', 56, 4, 5, 97815) I have read your letter to Kishorelal.
('65', 56, 4, 6, 97854) Kaka’s fever may be said to have come down now.
('65', 56, 4, 7, 97902) But he will still have to be careful.
('65', 56, 4, 8, 97940) What you write about him seems perfectly correct.
('65', 56, 4, 9, 97990) There will be a great deal of misunderstanding if he leaves Gujarat.
('65', 56, 4, 10, 98059) Probably you do not know the reason for his decision to resign.
('65', 56, 4, 11, 98123) It is not his failure to consult the other colleagues.
('65', 56, 4, 12, 98178) That was not a very serious error.
('65', 56, 4, 13, 98213) And there is also some misunderstanding regarding that.
('65', 56, 4, 14, 98269) But though he had not consulted the colleagues he stated in his letter to the Collector that the trustees desired to make a gift.
('65', 56, 4, 15, 98399) A trustee ought not to be guilty of such a lapse.
('65', 56, 4, 16, 98449) And, therefore, as atonement for it he resigned the trusteeship.
('65', 56, 4, 17, 98514) This was a correct step.
('65', 56, 4, 18, 98539) Neither Vallabhbhai nor anybody else had anything to do with it.
('65', 56, 4, 19, 98604) It was only a question of self purification or self awakening.
('65', 56, 4, 20, 98667) Now Kaka will refrain from leaving Gujarat at least for avoiding a misunderstanding.
('65', 56, 4, 21, 98752) No senior woman worker from the Ashram will be attached to Lakshmibehn 1. All of them are following their own independent paths.
('65', 56, 4, 22, 98881) I like this very much.
('65', 56, 4, 23, 98904) We should be satisfied with whatever progress results from this.
('65', 56, 4, 24, 98969) What Lakshmibehn needs is not company but a co worker.
('65', 56, 4, 25, 99024) She seems to feel alone here.
('65', 56, 4, 26, 99054) Perhaps she will feel like that everywhere and always.
('65', 56, 4, 27, 99109) I think she would prefer to have three or four or some more girls entrusted to her independent charge and be completely free to manage them as she liked.
('65', 56, 4, 28, 99263) She would both need and not need an adviser.
('65', 56, 4, 29, 99308) That is, she would consult him whenever she was in doubt, but act according to her own judgment.
('65', 56, 4, 30, 99405) This is not a defect, nor may it be a virtue; or it can be either.
('65', 56, 4, 31, 99472) It can be a shining virtue when it springs solely from the spirit of service.
('65', 56, 4, 32, 99550) But such is not Lakshmibehn’s case.
('65', 56, 4, 33, 99586) However, she has no clear plan for the future.
('65', 56, 4, 34, 99633) I, therefore, wish to discuss the problem again with her.
('65', 56, 4, 35, 99691) I have already discussed it once and this is the impression I have formed.
('65', 56, 4, 36, 99766) Can she stay with you?
('65', 56, 4, 37, 99789) Do you desire it?
('65', 56, 4, 38, 99807) How much do you earn there?
('65', 56, 4, 39, 99835) For how long do you intend to stay there?
('65', 56, 4, 40, 99877) You do wish ultimately to bury yourself in a village, don’t you?

('65', 57, 0, 1, 99961) 58 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 57, 1, 2, 100002) The Kanya Vidyalaya cannot be run today solely by women.
('65', 57, 1, 3, 100059) We do not yet have a sufficient number of such women workers.
('65', 57, 1, 4, 100121) A few institutions seem to be run by them, but even in their case men help indirectly.
('65', 57, 1, 5, 100208) There is no harm in this.
('65', 57, 1, 6, 100234) Men’s help will be needed for some years at least for running institutions in accordance with our ideals.
('65', 57, 1, 7, 100340) They are part of our experiment also.
('65', 57, 1, 8, 100378) There must be some men who have something of the woman too in them.
('65', 57, 1, 9, 100446) If men and women can never live together without getting disturbed by sex attractions, their brahmacharya is not brahmacharya.
('65', 57, 1, 10, 100573) Do not mother and son, father and daughter, brother and sister so live?
('65', 57, 1, 11, 100645) Why, then, cannot men and women who are not so related live likewise?
('65', 57, 1, 12, 100715) If we are sincere, we shall progress through our mistakes and realize one day that what seemed impossible has become possible.
('65', 57, 1, 13, 100842) I hope you don’t believe that there was the slightest feeling of despair in my advice to break up the Ashram.
('65', 57, 1, 14, 100952) If despair was the reason, I would have declared it.
('65', 57, 1, 15, 101005) The sacrifice of the Ashram was intended to add lustre to the great work it had done.
('65', 57, 1, 16, 101091) It is a pure thing, not an impure one, that is given as sacrifice.
('65', 57, 1, 17, 101158) The Ashram had purity enough for the cause for which it was sacrificed.
('65', 57, 1, 18, 101230) The reason behind my desire to leave the Congress is not corruption in it, but the increasing differences of principle with the intellectual section in it.
('65', 57, 1, 19, 101386) We can reform the constitution to deal with corruption, but to deal with differences of opinion one of the two parties should surrender to the other or they should fight it out.
('65', 57, 1, 20, 101564) The path of surrender is in conformity with ahimsa— in fighting there is mostly himsa.
('65', 57, 1, 21, 101651) About other things Kishorelal will write.

('65', 58, 2, 3, 101888) NARAYANRAO, May I call you Narayanrao 1 now?
('65', 58, 2, 4, 101933) Should a boy named after Narayana 2 be timid or brave?
('65', 58, 2, 5, 101988) Why should one be afraid of a minor operation like the removal of tonsils?
('65', 58, 2, 6, 102063) Even little children, much younger than you, submit to such operation.
('65', 58, 2, 7, 102134) Mani was brought home immediately after such an operation.
('65', 58, 2, 8, 102193) Will you be brave now?
('65', 58, 2, 9, 102216) If you are not, you, I, Mahadev and Durga, all of us, will be disgraced.
('65', 58, 2, 10, 102289) Even that doesn’t matter, though.
('65', 58, 2, 11, 102323) But the Ashram also will be disgraced.
('65', 58, 2, 12, 102362) How is it that you, who never tire of singing big bhajans, are afraid of a little pain?

('65', 58, 7, 18, 102585) SURENDRA, I understand what you say about M. I have now received a letter of repentance from him.
('65', 58, 7, 19, 102683) What pulled him down was his pride and his misplaced confidence about his purity.
('65', 58, 7, 20, 102765) I see that even in his letter of repentance.
('65', 58, 7, 21, 102810) We have now made some change in our way of living; still, I would suggest that whenever we suspect anybody we should caution him and the head of the institution in which he is working.
('65', 58, 7, 22, 102995) If I had had the faintest suspicion, I could perhaps have done him some good and he would not have been permitted to continue with self indulgence for years as he did.
('65', 58, 7, 23, 103163) Sharma says that he had cautioned me.
('65', 58, 7, 24, 103201) But I don’t remember.
('65', 58, 7, 25, 103223) However, I had no faith at all in his judgment at that time.
('65', 58, 7, 26, 103284) Even today I don’t have much.
('65', 58, 7, 27, 103314) I had proved to him in two instances that he was too willing to see the evil side of a man.
('65', 58, 7, 28, 103406) But when you say a thing I will certainly have to think about it.
('65', 58, 7, 29, 103472) What you say regarding girls is perfectly right for those who are

('65', 59, 1, 3, 103670) But this [freedom of] association is implied in our experiment.
('65', 59, 1, 4, 103734) Because our custom has been different and the present day ideas of unrestricted freedom are getting mixed up with our experiment, there is an appearance of failure in it.
('65', 59, 1, 5, 103905) But my impression on the whole is that our experiment has not proved a failure.
('65', 59, 1, 6, 103985) We should not forget that the experiment is based on the truth that the atman is its own friend or enemy.
('65', 59, 1, 7, 104091) We are trying to teach the girls to learn to protect themselves.
('65', 59, 1, 8, 104156) Similarly, we can only guide the young men.
('65', 59, 1, 9, 104200) We may try to frame rules of propriety to serve as hedges.
('65', 59, 1, 10, 104259) Sometimes our calculations may even go wrong.
('65', 59, 1, 11, 104305) We should go on correcting such errors.
('65', 59, 1, 12, 104345) I regard untruth to be a greater sin than sexual immorality.
('65', 59, 1, 13, 104406) If we don’t get tired and don’t give up our worship of truth, it will be well with us in the end.

('65', 59, 5, 18, 104623) September 22, 1934
('65', 59, 6, 19, 104642) NARAHARI,
('65', 59, 7, 20, 104652) One must accept water served by anybody, unless, of course, his hand or the utensil is not clean.
('65', 59, 7, 21, 104750) You may, if you wish, except that worker’s mother from this rule, though I wouldn’t like even that.
('65', 59, 7, 22, 104850) If we make such an exception, it is likely to create a good deal of bitterness in the Ashram.
('65', 59, 7, 23, 104944) I go even further and hold that, though the restrictions about inter dining and inter marrying observed outside the Ashram are all right, we should tolerate no restrictions about inter dining in the Ashram.
('65', 59, 7, 24, 105151) Hence we shall be justified in accepting anybody as a tenant only if he is ready to go as far as we do in this matter.
('65', 59, 7, 25, 105270) Sometimes we may have to tolerate a person whose services we need in connection with our work but who sticks to some practices regarding untouchability.
('65', 59, 7, 26, 105423) For example, an artisan whose help we require for a Harijan may tell us that he will not eat or drink anything touched by the latter, and we are unable to get anybody else; we may tolerate such a person.
('65', 59, 7, 27, 105627) But your questions are not about such a case.
('65', 59, 7, 28, 105673) You have still not been able to satisfy Sardar.
('65', 59, 7, 29, 105721) Try to do so if you can.
('65', 59, 7, 30, 105746) The problem of the library has no connection with the question he has raised.
('65', 59, 7, 31, 105824) You should see that very clearly.

('65', 60, 1, 2, 105919) not found fault with me, but Kaka’s error implies an error on my part.
('65', 60, 1, 3, 105990) Moreover, even if I am not a trustee, I am looked upon as a very vigilant watchman.
('65', 60, 1, 4, 106074) Looking at the matter in that light, it can be said that I should have saved Kaka even from writing that letter to the Collector.
('65', 60, 1, 5, 106204) Why did I at all [allow the] mention of the other Trustees in the letter without verifying the facts?
('65', 60, 1, 6, 106306) But doesn’t the poet’s line, “the powerful attract no blame” 1, apply to me also?
('65', 60, 1, 7, 106388) It is not that I have not borne this in mind.
('65', 60, 1, 8, 106434) Only, I have not involved myself in this affair.
('65', 60, 1, 9, 106483) It is enough for me that I have understood the truth.
('65', 60, 1, 10, 106537) And what more vigilance can I exercise?
('65', 60, 1, 11, 106577) If I did not act on the assumption that everybody knew his responsibility in what he did, I would not be able to cope with as much work as I do.
('65', 60, 1, 12, 106722) I have acted in this manner all my life.
('65', 60, 1, 13, 106763) I have been content to accept moral responsibility.
('65', 60, 1, 14, 106815) After writing all this, the conclusion to which I come is this, that though Vallabhbhai has understood all this in his mind he has fearlessly done what he thought right.
('65', 60, 1, 15, 106985) Even if, therefore, he harboursa prejudice against Kaka, that cannot be deduced from this incident.
('65', 60, 1, 16, 107085) Hence, if he did anything in the past, that should not be made a reason by Kaka for leaving Gujarat just now and, therefore, not a word should be uttered against Sardar.
('65', 60, 1, 17, 107255) Kaka has held his view all the time and we ought to try to persuade him to change it.
('65', 60, 1, 18, 107341) I did that even while I was in jail and am still trying to persuade Kaka to see the matter in that light.
('65', 60, 1, 19, 107447) And since Vallabhbhai’s name has been connected with Kaka’s desire to leave Gujarat and his good name has suffered, it has become all the more Kaka’s duty not to leave Gujarat.
('65', 60, 1, 20, 107624) Only then can the wings of slander be clipped.
('65', 60, 1, 21, 107671) Otherwise this kabar 2 will keep on flying.

('65', 61, 6, 12, 108448) This booklet is a collection of all my writings on varnadharma.
('65', 61, 6, 13, 108512) Its printing was complete some or perhaps many months ago but it remained unpublished in the absence of an introduction.
('65', 61, 6, 14, 108633) I had agreed to write the introduction but could not do so till now on account of my Harijan tour.
('65', 61, 8, 15, 108732) I should have loved to go through all my speeches and writings on varnashrama during the past fifteen years before writing this introduction, but it was physically impossible.
('65', 61, 8, 16, 108908) perhaps it is well that I cannot do so.
('65', 61, 8, 17, 108948) I have never made a fetish of consistency.
('65', 61, 8, 18, 108991) I am a votary of truth and I must say what I feel and think at a given moment on the question, without regard to what I may have said before on it.
('65', 61, 8, 19, 109139) The publisher too wants this.
('65', 61, 8, 20, 109169) 3 It is for the reader to find out how far my present views coincide with those formerly expressed.
('65', 61, 8, 21, 109269) Wherever he finds that what I have said or written before runs contrary to what I am writing now, he should without hesitation reject the former.
('65', 61, 8, 22, 109415) I do not claim omniscience.
('65', 61, 8, 23, 109443) 4 I claim to be a votary of truth and to follow to the best of my ability what seems to be the truth at a given time.
('65', 61, 8, 24, 109561) As my vision gets clearer, my views must grow clearer with daily practice.
('65', 61, 8, 25, 109636) Where I have deliberately altered an opinion, the change should be

('65', 62, 0, 1, 109837) VOL. 65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 63
('65', 62, 1, 2, 109887) obvious, only a careful eye would notice a gradual and imperceptible evolution.
('65', 62, 1, 3, 109967) Varnashramadharma is a compound word known to all our vernaculars, and, though the word dharma (law) is related to both the components, varna and ashrama, the words are rarely used in separation.
('65', 62, 1, 4, 110163) Hinduism is but another and imperfect name for varnashramadharma.
('65', 62, 1, 5, 110229) The word ‘Hindu’ was apparently coined by foreigners and has more geographical than any other content.
('65', 62, 1, 6, 110332) The dharma (religion or law) that Hindus have professed to observe is varnashramadharma.
('65', 62, 1, 7, 110421) To say that the dharma of the Hindus is Aryan does not carry us very far.
('65', 62, 1, 8, 110495) It simply means that the Hindus, or those who lived in the east of the Indus or believed in the Vedic dharma, 1
('65', 62, 2, 9, 110607) called themselves Aryas and others non Aryas.
('65', 62, 2, 10, 110653) To give our dharma this kind of ethnic label is in my opinion misleading.
('65', 62, 2, 11, 110727) It should have a name that declares its predominant characteristic, and everyone will admit that Hinduism is nothing without the law of varna and ashrama.
('65', 62, 2, 12, 110882) It would be impossible to find any smriti of which a large part was not devoted to varnashramadharma.
('65', 62, 2, 13, 110984) This law of varna and ashrama is to be traced to our most ancient scriptures —the Vedas, and so no one who calls himself a Hindu may ignore it.
('65', 62, 2, 14, 111128) It is his duty to study it in all its bearings, and to reject it if it is an excrescence, and to foster it and restore it to its pristine purity, if it represents a universal law.
('65', 62, 2, 15, 111308) So far as the law of ashrama is concerned, it is extinct, alike in profession and observance.
('65', 62, 2, 16, 111402) Hinduism lays down four ashramas or stages—the life of a brahmachari (continent student), the life of a grihastha (householder), the life of a vanaprastha (who has retired) and the life of a sannyasi (renunciator)—through which every Hindu has to pass to fulfil his purpose in life.
('65', 62, 2, 17, 111685) But the first and the third are practically non existent today, the fourth may be said to be observed in name to a small extent.
('65', 62, 2, 18, 111814) The second is professed to be observed by all today, but it is observed in name, not in spirit.
('65', 62, 2, 19, 111910) Grihasthas or householders of a kind we all are, inasmuch as we eat and drink and propagate our kind, like all created beings.
('65', 62, 2, 20, 112037) But in doing so, we fulfil the law of the flesh and not of the spirit.
('65', 62, 2, 21, 112108) Only those married couples who fulfil the law of the spirit can be said to observe the law of grihastha ashrama.
('65', 62, 2, 22, 112221) Those who live the mere animal life do not observe the law The life of householders of today is one of indulgence And as the four stages represent a ladder of growth and
('65', 62, 3, 23, 112391) 1 The words “or believed in the Vedic dharma” are from Harijanbandhu
('65', 63, 0, 1, 112460) 64 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 63, 1, 2, 112501) are interdependent, one cannot leap to the stage of a vanaprastha or a sannyasi, unless he or she fulfilled the law of the first two ashramas— brahmacharya and grihastha.
('65', 63, 1, 3, 112672) The law of the ashrama, therefore, is a dead letter today.
('65', 63, 1, 4, 112731) It can be revived only if the law of varna, with which it is intimately interlinked, is revived.
('65', 63, 1, 5, 112828) That brings us to a consideration of the law of varna.
('65', 63, 1, 6, 112883) Varna ‘can certainly be said to exist, though in a distorted form.
('65', 63, 1, 7, 112950) There are four varnas, but the distortion that passes as varna today is divided into countless castes.
('65', 63, 1, 8, 113053) All the four varnas are divided into numerous castes and sub castes, but Whilst those who belong to the first three are not ashamed to declare that they belong to them, those who belong to the fourth, viz., Shudra, prefer to declare the sub caste as their label rather than their varna, which they regard as a badge of humiliation.
('65', 63, 1, 9, 113385) But labels never reveal a man’s character, nor does the fact that a man clings to a label show that he deserves it.
('65', 63, 1, 10, 113501) A black man will not be red, no matter how repeatedly he calls himself red.
('65', 63, 1, 11, 113577) In the same way, one does not become a Brahmin by calling oneself a Brahmin.
('65', 63, 1, 12, 113654) Not until a man reveals in his life the attributes of a Brahmin can he deserve that name.
('65', 63, 1, 13, 113744) Considered in this light, varna may be said to be extinct.
('65', 63, 1, 14, 113803) If we may, indeed, claim a label, we can call ourselves Shudras, though really we are not entitled to that name either, inasmuch as we do not observe the law of that varna.
('65', 63, 1, 15, 113976) This law is the law of one’s being, which one has to fulfil.
('65', 63, 1, 16, 114037) The fulfilment should be spontaneous and no matter of honour or shame.
('65', 63, 1, 17, 114108) How many are there who are fulfilling the law as law, i.e, spontaneously?
('65', 63, 1, 18, 114182) We fulfil it because we cannot help it we are all serfs, whether we will it or no.
('65', 63, 1, 19, 114265) Let no one contend that varna exists today, because all the functions of the different varnas are being performed by someone or the other and somehow or the other.
('65', 63, 1, 20, 114429) Varna is intimately, if not indissolubly, connected with birth, and the observance of the law of varna means the following on the part of us all the hereditary and traditional calling of our forefathers in a spirit of duty.
('65', 63, 1, 21, 114653) Those who thus fulfil the law of their varna can be counted on one’s fingers’ ends.
('65', 63, 1, 22, 114737) This performance of one’s hereditary function is done as a matter of duty, though it naturally carries with it the earning of one’s livelihood.
('65', 63, 1, 23, 114881) Thus, the function of a Brahmin is to study and to teach the science of Brahman (or spiritual truth).
('65', 63, 1, 24, 114983) He performs the function, as he cannot do otherwise, as it is the law of his being.
('65', 63, 1, 25, 115067) That secures him his livelihood, but he will take it as a gift from God.
('65', 63, 1, 26, 115140) A Kshatriya will
('65', 64, 0, 1, 115157) VOL. 65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 65
('65', 64, 1, 2, 115207) perform the function of protecting the people in the same spirit, accepting for his livelihood whatever the people can afford to give him.
('65', 64, 1, 3, 115346) A Vaishya will pursue wealth producing occupations for the welfare of the community, keeping for himself enough for his own maintenance and rendering the balance to the community in one shape or another.
('65', 64, 1, 4, 115550) A Shudra will perform physical labour in the same spirit of service.
('65', 64, 1, 5, 115619) Varna is determined by birth, but can be retained only by observing its obligations.
('65', 64, 1, 6, 115704) One born of Brahmin parents will be called a Brahmin, but if his life fails to reveal the attributes of a Brahmin when he comes of age, he cannot be called a Brahmin.
('65', 64, 1, 7, 115871) He will have fallen from Brahminhood.
('65', 64, 1, 8, 115909) On the other hand, one who is born not a Brahmin but reveals in his conduct the attributes of a Brahmin will be regarded as a Brahmin, though he will himself disclaim the label.
('65', 64, 1, 9, 116087) Varna thus conceived is no man made institution but the law of life universally governing the human family.
('65', 64, 1, 10, 116195) Fulfilment of the law would make life livable, would spread peace and content, end all clashes and conflicts, put an end to starvation and pauperization, solve the problem of population and even end disease and suffering.
('65', 64, 1, 11, 116417) But if varna reveals the law of one’s being and thus the duty one has to perform, it confers no right, and the idea of superiority or inferiority is wholly repugnant to it.
('65', 64, 1, 12, 116590) All varnas are equal, for the community depends no less on one than on another.
('65', 64, 1, 13, 116670) Today varna means gradations of high and low.
('65', 64, 1, 14, 116716) It is a hideous travesty of the original.
('65', 64, 1, 15, 116758) The law of varna was discovered by our ancestors by stern austerities.
('65', 64, 1, 16, 116829) They sought to live up to the law to the best of their capacity.
('65', 64, 1, 17, 116894) We have distorted it today and have made ourselves the laughing stock of the world.
('65', 64, 1, 18, 116978) No wonder that we have today amongst the Hindus a section which is bending its energies to a destruction of the institution which in their opinion spells the ruin of the Hindus And certainly one need have no mercy for the hideous distortion, which means nothing but destruction of Hinudism.
('65', 64, 3, 19, 117269) I do not for a moment suggest that there should be no restrictions about food and drink or about marital relations.
('65', 64, 3, 20, 117385) I do not myself regard it a duty to eat whatever is offered and in whatever
('65', 64, 4, 21, 117461) 1 The Gujarati original of what follows appeared in Harijanbandhu 23 9 1934.
('65', 65, 0, 1, 117538) 66 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 65, 1, 2, 117579) company I should chance to be, and I regard it as nothing short of self indulgence to marry according to one’s fancy.
('65', 65, 1, 3, 117697) Strict restraint is the law of life and must, therefore, govern these relations no less than others.
('65', 65, 1, 4, 117798) I hold that there are rules about diet.
('65', 65, 1, 5, 117838) Man is not an omnivorous animal, nor may he pick up his mate wherever he likes.
('65', 65, 1, 6, 117918) But restrictions on marital or social relations have nothing to do with varnadharma, which is a different thing altogether.
('65', 65, 1, 7, 118042) I can conceive blameless marital relations between different varnas, and people of different varnas seated together to eat food permissible to all.
('65', 65, 1, 8, 118190) There is evidence enough to show that in ancient times there were no watertight compartments between varnas, so far as marital and social relations went, and I have no doubt that, in making varna a mere matter of restrictions about food and drink and marriage, we have done Hinduism grave harm.
('65', 65, 1, 9, 118485) Though the law of varna is a special discovery of some Hindu seer, it has universal application.
('65', 65, 1, 10, 118582) Every religion has some distinguish ing characteristic, but if it expresses a principle or law, it ought to have universal application.
('65', 65, 1, 11, 118718) That is how I look at the law of varna.
('65', 65, 1, 12, 118758) The world may ignore it today but it will have to accept it in the time to come.
('65', 65, 1, 13, 118839) I would define the law briefly thus: The law of varna means that everyone shall follow as a matter of dharma—duty—the hereditary calling of his forefathers, in so far as it is not inconsistent with fundamental ethics.
('65', 65, 1, 14, 119057) He will earn his livelihood by following that calling.
('65', 65, 1, 15, 119112) He may not hoard riches, but devote the balance for the good of the people.
('65', 65, 1, 16, 119188) The four varnas have been compared in the Vedas to the four members of the body, and no simile could be happier.
('65', 65, 1, 17, 119301) If they are members of one body, how can one be superior or inferior to another?
('65', 65, 1, 18, 119382) If the members of the body had the power of expression and each of them were to say that it was higher and better than the rest, the body would go to pieces.
('65', 65, 1, 19, 119540) Even so, our body politic, the body of humanity, would go to pieces, if it were to perpetuate the canker of superiority or inferiority.
('65', 65, 1, 20, 119676) It is this canker that is at the root of the various ills of our time, especially class wars and civil strife.
('65', 65, 1, 21, 119787) It should not be difficult for even the meanest understanding to see that these wars and strife could not be ended except by the observance of the law of varna.
('65', 65, 1, 22, 119948) For it ordains that everyone shall fulfil the law of one’s being by doing in a spirit of duty and service that to which one is
('65', 66, 0, 1, 120075) VOL. 65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 67
('65', 66, 1, 2, 120125) Earning of livelihood is the necessary result.
('65', 66, 1, 3, 120172) But the law has to be fulfilled for its own sake.
('65', 66, 1, 4, 120222) Its due observance by a large part of mankind will end the conflicting inequalities and give place to an equality in diversity.
('65', 66, 1, 5, 120350) All callings would be equally reputable—whether that of the minister or of the lawyer, of the doctor or the leather worker, of the carpenter or the scavenger, of the soldier or the trader, of the farmer or the spiritual teacher.
('65', 66, 1, 6, 120579) In this ideal state of things, there would be no room for the monstrous anomaly of the three varnas lording it over the Shudra, or of the Kshatriya and the Vaishya enjoying themselves in their palaces and the Brahmin contenting himself with a cottage and the Shudra toiling for the rest and living in a hovel.
('65', 66, 1, 7, 120889) This chaotic state of things indicates that the law of varna has become a dead letter.
('65', 66, 1, 8, 120976) When, if ever, the ideal state of things, as indicated above, had been reached in India, I do not know.
('65', 66, 1, 9, 121080) But I do hold that it is the only ideal state that is easy enough to approach and that it is not only for the Hindus but for the whole of humanity.
('65', 66, 1, 10, 121228) Under such dispensation, all property will be held by its respective holders in trust for the community.
('65', 66, 1, 11, 121333) No one will claim it as his own.
('65', 66, 1, 12, 121366) The king will hold his palace in trust for his people and will collect the taxes only to be used for the benefit of the people.
('65', 66, 1, 13, 121494) He has the right to have no more than is enough to keep him, the rest belongs to, and shall be spent only for, the people.
('65', 66, 1, 14, 121617) Indeed, he will, by virtue of his resourcefulness as a ruler, add to what he collects from the people and return it to them manifold.
('65', 66, 1, 15, 121751) The Vaishya likewise is such a trustee.
('65', 66, 1, 16, 121791) The Shudra is made so.
('65', 66, 1, 17, 121814) Indeed, if one may have preference, the Shudra, who performs body labour in a spirit of service and duty, who has nothing to’ call his own and who has no desire for ownership, is worthy of the world’s homage; he is the lord of all because he is the greatest servant.
('65', 66, 1, 18, 122081) The dutiful Shudra will, of course, repudiate any such claim, but the gods will shower their choicest blessings on him.
('65', 66, 1, 19, 122201) One may not say this of the proletariat of the present day.
('65', 66, 1, 20, 122261) They certainly own nothing, but I expect they covet ownership.
('65', 66, 1, 21, 122324) The calling of labour and service is no pleasant duty to them.
('65', 66, 1, 22, 122387) It is a painful task, for it does not satisfy even the cravings of the flesh.
('65', 66, 1, 23, 122465) My praise is for the ideal labourer.
('65', 66, 1, 24, 122502) It is the estate I have longed to attain.
('65', 66, 1, 25, 122544) But this duty of labour cannot be imposed on anybody.
('65', 66, 1, 26, 122598) In fact, the panegyric may be uttered only by those of the three varnas who fulfil the law themselves, viz., the law of regarding and behaving
('65', 67, 0, 1, 122741) 68 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 67, 1, 2, 122782) themselves as the servants of the community and holding all the property in trust for it.
('65', 67, 1, 3, 122872) The three varnas exist today only in name, they are supposed to invest one with a higher status than that of the Shudras and have ceased to imply any duty to be performed.
('65', 67, 1, 4, 123044) There is nothing, therefore, to be surprised at, nor to be sorry for, when in such a state of things the Shudras should be jealous of the others’ possessions and their estate and seek to share them.
('65', 67, 1, 5, 123243) When the law of varna was discovered, there could be no compulsion from without.
('65', 67, 1, 6, 123324) The world can only be sustained by a willing and dutiful observance of it.
('65', 67, 1, 7, 123399) In an age where competition is held to be the law of life, and possession in the largest measure of the world’s goods the summum bonum, and when everyone counts oneself free to follow any calling one likes, this attempt to hold up varna as the law of life may well be regarded as an idle dream, and an attempt to revive it as childish folly.
('65', 67, 1, 8, 123741) Be that as it may, it is my firm conviction that it is true socialism.
('65', 67, 1, 9, 123812) In the language of the Gita, it is equality of the spirit, without which no other equality is possible.
('65', 67, 1, 10, 123916) The performance of it, no matter how slight, bodes well both for him who performs it and for the rest of mankind.
('65', 67, 1, 11, 124030) I may add that, though the varnas are to be four, the number is not, in my opinion, unalterable.
('65', 67, 1, 12, 124127) In the future reconstruction, the number may be more or even less than four.
('65', 67, 1, 13, 124204) What is essential is that one must seek one’s livelihood, and no more, from following the vocation to which one is born.

('65', 67, 5, 17, 124439) Several years ago, a close friend and associate belonging to a rich prosperous family, who had received a high degree of education and had travelled and seen much in different parts of the world, solemnly abjured the use of all vehicular and other means of transport and has ever since stuck to his resolve through all vicissitudes of weather and health.
('65', 67, 5, 18, 124794) He has kept up correspondence with me.
('65', 67, 5, 19, 124833) I have preserved one of his letters which I received during my Harijan tour,
('65', 67, 6, 20, 124910) 1 The Gujarati original appeared in Harijanbandhu, 23 9 1934. The text reproduced here, except the last paragraph, is from the abridged version in Harijan.
('65', 68, 0, 1, 125066) VOL. 65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 69
('65', 68, 1, 2, 125116) in order to share it with the readers of the Harijanbandhu.
('65', 68, 1, 3, 125176) I am sure the following excerpt from it recounting some of his experiences will be appreciated by them:
('65', 68, 2, 4, 125280) Of the many vows that I took, I have found the one about travelling on foot to be the most beneficial.
('65', 68, 2, 5, 125383) It has afforded me the richest experience.
('65', 68, 2, 6, 125426) As a result of it, my faith in God today is much stronger than it was when I set out from Ahmedabad about a couple of years ago.
('65', 68, 3, 7, 125555) Having had experience of both riches and poverty, I am in a position to testify today that, whilst I have almost always found pride and licence threatening the life of the rich and whilst those who wielded authority could not without difficulty escape the intoxication of power, poverty alone left enough scope for a spontaneous and natural devotion to God, a spirit of service and the capacity to suffer and to endure.
('65', 68, 3, 8, 125975) I have now clearly realized that the state of voluntary poverty is really a blessed state and that riches, in the worldly sense, are nothing in comparison.
('65', 68, 3, 9, 126131) May God always keep me in poverty and keep me free from the slightest desire for possession or from the care for the morrow.
('65', 68, 4, 10, 126256) Everywhere I have found that men despise the sinning and the fallen, and yet who amongst us can claim to be immaculate?
('65', 68, 4, 11, 126376) I have at last grasped the great secret of shunning sin but not the sinner.
('65', 68, 4, 12, 126452) This friend has travelled on foot from Gujarat to and beyond Dehra Dun, has passed through hundreds upon hundreds of villages and come in contact with the villagers.
('65', 68, 4, 13, 126618) His testimony should, therefore, command our respect.
('65', 68, 4, 14, 126672) Kindred spirits in all climes and ages have borne similar testimony to the joy and beauty of travelling on foot and renouncing all worldly possessions.
('65', 68, 4, 15, 126824) Thoreau’s Walden in praise of walking is well known.
('65', 68, 4, 16, 126877) All the great reformers of the world who have from time to time effected religious revolutions have eschewed the use of vehicles and walked thousands of miles for delivering their mission.
('65', 68, 4, 17, 127066) Yet, by the intensity of their faith and the strength of their realization, they were able to achieve what we, in our aeroplane age, with all the gee gaws at our command, could hardly aspire to.
('65', 68, 4, 18, 127261) Not mad rush, but unperturbed calmness brings wisdom.
('65', 68, 4, 19, 127315) This maxim holds as true today as when it was first propounded ages ago.
('65', 68, 5, 20, 127388) Those who hear of this aspirant’s experience will not all take to walking nor will they pray to become poor.
('65', 68, 5, 21, 127497) Also they may not distinguish between the sin and the sinner and learn to love the sinner

('65', 69, 1, 3, 127687) But it will be no mean achievement if we learn the value of this attitude and try to follow it as best as we can.

('65', 69, 4, 7, 127952) I give below extracts from a letter 1 which Shri Chhotalal Gandhi of Ankleshwar has written to me regarding the Harijans of Sajod.
('65', 69, 4, 8, 128083) While the wound of Talaja is still fresh, here is another.
('65', 69, 4, 9, 128142) Everywhere it is the same.
('65', 69, 4, 10, 128169) The law says that Harijan Hindus enjoy equal civil rights with caste Hindus.
('65', 69, 4, 11, 128246) Even the officials are ready to help.
('65', 69, 4, 12, 128284) But the fanatic Hindus seem to care little for the law or order of the officers.
('65', 69, 4, 13, 128365) How to overcome such utter ignorance?
('65', 69, 4, 14, 128403) Ahimsa seems defeated and love seems to dry up.
('65', 69, 4, 15, 128451) But I find the pen quoting the lines: “As long as the elephant relied on his own strength, it availed him not” and “Rama is the strength of the weak” and they comfort me.
('65', 69, 4, 16, 128622) Ahimsa is true ahimsa only if it keeps shining even in the midst of darkness all around.
('65', 69, 4, 17, 128711) The remedy for himsa is ahimsa, for hatred love and for untruth truth, as the remedy for cold is sunshine.
('65', 69, 4, 18, 128818) If there are sincere, religious minded reformers in Sajod, they are sure to win in the end.
('65', 69, 4, 19, 128910) Let the fanatic caste Hindus do as they please.
('65', 69, 4, 20, 128958) The reformers should shelter the oppressed Harijans.
('65', 69, 4, 21, 129011) They should rigidly adhere to the rule that they will refuse to avail themselves of any facility not permitted to the Harijans.
('65', 69, 4, 22, 129139) They should of course secure for the latter officers’ help whenever necessary.
('65', 69, 4, 23, 129218) They should plead with the caste Hindus to keep within proper limits.
('65', 69, 4, 24, 129288) Let the orthodox Hindus take bath or do any other expiation if the Harijans exercise their rights and enter a public place.
('65', 69, 4, 25, 129412) The Shastras do not enjoin punishment of the Harijans.
('65', 69, 4, 26, 129467) They only say that anybody who regards himself polluted should take a bath.
('65', 69, 4, 27, 129543) No Shastra suggests that we should harass or beat the person by whom we regard ourselves polluted.
('65', 69, 4, 28, 129642) This is so simple a thing that the reformers should have confidence in themselves and, keeping within the bounds of ahimsa, go on doing their duty.
('65', 69, 4, 29, 129790) The suggestion to send some well known public worker to Sajod
('65', 69, 5, 30, 129852) 1 Not translated here.
('65', 69, 5, 31, 129875) It described the harassment of Harijans in Sajod, in Ankleshwar taluka, consequent on the insistence of the authorities that the Harijan pupils in the local school should be permitted to sit with the other pupils.

('65', 70, 1, 2, 130139) and the nearby places is certainly a good one.
('65', 70, 1, 3, 130186) But visits by the leaders in Ankleshwar taluka itself are likely to produce better results than a visit by someone sent from a distant place.
('65', 70, 1, 4, 130328) We cannot always rely on such outside help.
('65', 70, 1, 5, 130372) Ultimate success will depend on the ceaseless vigilance, ability and capacity for self restraint of the local workers.

('65', 71, 7, 11, 131970) DEAR FRIEND,
('65', 71, 8, 12, 131983) With reference to your letter of the 20th instant, received yesterday, it seems to me that your question can be answered in two ways.
('65', 71, 8, 13, 132117) If the exhibition is to be an exhibition of things that India has been able to produce, exhibits such as you refer to have their proper place in such an exhibition.
('65', 71, 8, 14, 132282) It however, the exhibition is a purely educational effort made to encourage khadi and swadeshi in terms of the millions, then I should exclude rigorously anything that has no direct bearing on the manufactures made today by the millions of villagers in the villages.
('65', 71, 8, 15, 132549) I have no right to say anything further, or to give any further guidance.
('65', 71, 8, 16, 132623) Your Committee are the proper judges to decide what the exhibition is for, or what it should have.
('65', 71, 9, 17, 132722) Yours sincerely,

('65', 74, 6, 10, 135767) His services cannot be rewarded with money.
('65', 74, 6, 11, 135811) You two have become friends.
('65', 74, 6, 12, 135840) There can be no giving and receiving money between friends.
('65', 74, 6, 13, 135900) I think he will feel offended if you offer to pay him.
('65', 74, 6, 14, 135955) If he does accept, I would be surprised.
('65', 74, 6, 15, 135996) His needs are being met and I have also been doing whatever else is necessary for him.
('65', 74, 6, 16, 136083) You need not, therefore, worry about his economic condition.
('65', 74, 6, 17, 136144) In fact I see from his letters that he would be fully satisfied if you are completely cured physically, mentally and spiritually and if you can testify that you were cured mainly through his instrumentality—and that is as it should be.
('65', 74, 6, 18, 136380) I would, therefore, advise you to give up the idea of paying him that sum.
('65', 74, 6, 19, 136455) Having said this, let me repeat that you are a completely free agent and that the money belongs to you.
('65', 74, 6, 20, 136559) If you think that giving it to him would be the best way of using it, by all means give it.

('65', 75, 1, 5, 137275) I suppose you also know that I am all the time in search of a guru.

('65', 75, 1, 16, 137822) 1 She is not a woman who would go anywhere merely out of curiosity.
('65', 75, 1, 17, 137890) I found your letter to her very curt.

('65', 75, 6, 27, 138334) There was a letter to Brijkrishnadas from the lady superintendent of your institution saying that you were having fever with temperature at 100º and have lost ten lb., that you can eat only once a day and felt no appetite in the evening.
('65', 75, 6, 28, 138572) You occasionally write me a postcard, but it is always practically blank.
('65', 75, 6, 29, 138646) I think it would be better if, instead, you didn’t write at all.
('65', 75, 6, 30, 138711) You should understand that, if they say dharma should be practised with proper regard for one,s health, while studying also one should take proper care of one,s health.
('65', 75, 6, 31, 138880) Even if you were to stand first

('65', 76, 1, 3, 139136) Why don’t you study so as not to endanger your health?
('65', 76, 1, 4, 139191) Can you not prepare for the same examination in Rajkot?
('65', 76, 1, 5, 139247) Sushila would certainly help you.
('65', 76, 1, 6, 139281) You will get there facility for studying all the subjects which you are studying now.
('65', 76, 1, 7, 139367) The air and water of Rajkot have also agreed with you.
('65', 76, 1, 8, 139422) Krishnadas says that you have also not been able to make any friend there.
('65', 76, 1, 9, 139497) If all this is true, you should write to me so that I might write more.
('65', 76, 1, 10, 139569) If you are afraid that somebody might read your letters, you should mark them ‘Private,.
('65', 76, 1, 11, 139658) Nobody would then read them.

('65', 77, 8, 13, 140700) I had already asked [them] to write [to you] before I received it.
('65', 77, 8, 14, 140767) Nobody will read your letter, though it contains nothing private and anybody who reads it is likely to learn something from it.
('65', 77, 8, 15, 140895) I would like it if you send me your articles, etc.
('65', 77, 8, 16, 140946) I may be able to know your progress from them.
('65', 77, 8, 17, 140993) Your time table is good.
('65', 77, 8, 18, 141018) Your hours of rising and meals seem to be all right.
('65', 77, 8, 19, 141071) I will arrange that a sum of Rs. 5 be sent to you every month as suggested by you.
('65', 77, 8, 20, 141154) I should like you to let me know your needs without any hesitation.
('65', 77, 8, 21, 141222) Ramachandran will not accept boarding charges for you.
('65', 77, 8, 22, 141277) I will respect his wishes.
('65', 77, 8, 23, 141304) Your reading is good.
('65', 77, 8, 24, 141326) Don,t mind if he teaches you poems.
('65', 77, 8, 25, 141362) One should learn them too.
('65', 77, 8, 26, 141389) I suppose you are learning short hand only for my sake.
('65', 77, 8, 27, 141445) I think you have unnecessarily taken up that burden.
('65', 77, 8, 28, 141498) But I am not asking you to stop it now.
('65', 77, 8, 29, 141538) It is certainly a useful thing.
('65', 77, 8, 30, 141570) I am very glad that you are learning Malayalam.
('65', 77, 8, 31, 141618) I think it would be very good if you pick it up and also Tamil.
('65', 77, 8, 32, 141682) It is not difficult for one who loves languages to learn several of them.
('65', 77, 8, 33, 141756) After you have had some experience there, you may spend some time in Madanapally if you wish to do so.

('65', 78, 1, 4, 142049) Many such things are being written about me.
('65', 78, 1, 5, 142094) I learn something even from them.
('65', 78, 1, 6, 142128) At least one learns humility.
('65', 78, 1, 7, 142158) It is necessary for us to know how others see us.
('65', 78, 1, 8, 142208) Sometimes they may even be right.
('65', 78, 1, 9, 142242) For self examination, such criticism is very useful indeed.
('65', 78, 1, 10, 142302) Praises are of no help here.
('65', 78, 1, 11, 142331) One learns very much from criticism.
('65', 78, 1, 12, 142368) Write to me regularly.
('65', 78, 1, 13, 142391) I receive letters from Harilal regularly.

('65', 78, 1, 15, 142496) He is studying the Gita fairly well.
('65', 78, 1, 16, 142533) I have written to him and promised to help him.
('65', 78, 1, 17, 142581) Let us see what happens.

('65', 78, 6, 25, 142856) This was as different from his letter to you as an elephant is from a horse.
('65', 78, 6, 26, 142933) In it he was flying in the air.
('65', 78, 6, 27, 142965) He had shaken off the bondage of rules and it seemed to him easy to achieve in a matter of days what Vishwamitra had taken years to do.

('65', 78, 12, 35, 143276) The last letter I have not sent to Damodardas.
('65', 78, 12, 36, 143323) If the matter is to be clarified you should write to him direct.
('65', 78, 12, 37, 143388) I have no idea if I shall have any time to spare in Bombay.

('65', 79, 1, 2, 143589) I do not see any harm in accepting a maintenance allowance from your brothers.
('65', 79, 1, 3, 143668) You cannot but accept it from some source or the other if you devote all your time to serving.
('65', 79, 1, 4, 143763) As your brothers cannot render service themselves there is nothing surprising if they supported one who wishes to serve; it will be a noble act.
('65', 79, 1, 5, 143908) So far you could be said to have been observing aparigraha 1. But accumulating the amount in balance is as good as stealing and outright possession.
('65', 79, 1, 6, 144057) What can a really poor man do for his friends?
('65', 79, 1, 7, 144104) Should he steal and give them money?
('65', 79, 1, 8, 144141) This is not friendship but enmity which you are practising.
('65', 79, 1, 9, 144201) Why should you not announce to all your friends that you are no more a Chandiwala 2 but only a poor servant.
('65', 79, 1, 10, 144310) Their friendship will be proved true if they remain your friends even in your poverty.
('65', 79, 1, 11, 144397) Have you any idea how you and they became friends?
('65', 79, 1, 12, 144448) You had money and they squandered it right and left.
('65', 79, 1, 13, 144501) All that you write in this respect is only self deception.
('65', 79, 1, 14, 144560) At any rate, this is my reading.
('65', 79, 1, 15, 144593) But you are not to act upon it till you have truly realized it.
('65', 79, 1, 16, 144657) Your heart,s bidding should be regarded as the truth though the world may pronounce it false.
('65', 79, 1, 17, 144751) What can you possibly do in Bombay during the Congress session?
('65', 79, 1, 18, 144815) Do you want to fall ill?
('65', 79, 1, 19, 144840) Why need you leave the quiet of Mussoorie?
('65', 79, 1, 20, 144883) Stay on and spin more, engage in deeper introspection and make yourself fit.
('65', 79, 1, 21, 144960) But even in this matter your own inclination must not be repressed.
('65', 79, 1, 22, 145028) For my part I am keeping everyone away.

('65', 81, 7, 14, 147283) I have your letter enclosing me a report of the Khaddar Samsthan.
('65', 81, 7, 15, 147349) You give me therein the speed of takli spinners.
('65', 81, 7, 16, 147398) It is very poor compared to the results obtained here.
('65', 81, 7, 17, 147453) Therefore my opinion is that someone should learn the method of spinning adopted here.
('65', 81, 7, 18, 147540) It is a brilliant discovery.
('65', 81, 7, 19, 147569) The highest speed attained is 400 rounds per hour.
('65', 81, 7, 20, 147620) It is easily learnt.
('65', 81, 7, 21, 147641) The average speed attained here is over 200 rounds.
('65', 81, 7, 22, 147693) Little children learn the method much more quickly than old men like me.
('65', 81, 7, 23, 147766) I am trying to learn it.
('65', 81, 7, 24, 147791) I have not mastered it, but I have no doubt that with a little perseverance I shall be able to do well.
('65', 81, 7, 25, 147895) I am not yet satisfied with the barter method in which paddy has been adopted as the standard.
('65', 81, 7, 26, 147990) It requires very careful study.

('65', 82, 6, 8, 148513) MY DEAR AMRITLAL,
('65', 82, 7, 9, 148531) With reference to our conversation of yesterday, I know that my letters and my talks about the Congress attitude in respect of the Princes and the people of the Indian States have given rise to some misunderstanding.
('65', 82, 7, 10, 148748) It surprises me that anybody should think that I do not consider them to be an integral part of the Indian nation.
('65', 82, 7, 11, 148863) Of course they are, even as Indians residing in the other parts of geographical India are.
('65', 82, 7, 12, 148954) Though we are under different systems of Government, surely we are one.
('65', 82, 7, 13, 149026) I was also surprised to be told by you that some persons attribute to me the opinion that people of the Indian States who are members of the Congress are so by sufference.
('65', 82, 7, 14, 149198) There is a definite provision in the Congress constitution for their being enrolled as members, and those who subscribe to the Congress objective and carry out the other rules governing the membership have as much right to be enrolled as members as any other Indian.

('65', 83, 7, 10, 150075) September 27, 1934
('65', 83, 8, 11, 150094) MY DEAR MENON, In connection with Shrimati Matilda B. Kallon I am quite satisfied that although she is born a Christian she will have no hesitation in imparting religious instruction to Harijan boys and girls in accordance with the tenets of Hindu faith.
('65', 83, 8, 12, 150349) There should, therefore, be no difficulty about entrusting the hostel to her care on the ground of her being born a Christian.
('65', 83, 8, 13, 150476) Here is a copy of her letter to me.

('65', 84, 3, 4, 150742) MY DEAR MATILDA,
('65', 84, 4, 5, 150759) I have your letter.
('65', 84, 4, 6, 150779) I have written 1 to K. Rama Menon to the effect that your being a Christian should not be in the way of the hostel being entrusted to your care.
('65', 84, 4, 7, 150924) Your letter is completely satisfactory.

('65', 84, 10, 13, 151120) I have replied to your letter.
('65', 84, 10, 14, 151151) It is not right to ask you both to come over to Wardha just now.
('65', 84, 10, 15, 151216) Let the treatment at the hospital there also be completed.
('65', 84, 10, 16, 151275) The climate there leaves nothing to be desired.
('65', 84, 10, 17, 151323) It is a different thing if Ramdas does not like the place.
('65', 84, 10, 18, 151382) You should, therefore, have patience.
('65', 84, 10, 19, 151420) God will see that everything ends well.
('65', 84, 10, 20, 151460) Rajendrababu is leaving tomorrow, and Sardar too.

('65', 85, 2, 3, 151720) September 27, 1934
('65', 85, 3, 4, 151739) JAMNALAL, Vallabhbhai tells me that you are thinking of buying a cloth mill in .
('65', 85, 3, 5, 151820) 1. By “you” I mean your firm.
('65', 85, 3, 6, 151850) I was certainly shocked to hear this.
('65', 85, 3, 7, 151888) I felt that it was wrong for a person like you, who had taken so much interest in khadi, to own a cotton mill; but I could not decide whether I should write to you.
('65', 85, 3, 8, 152053) Meanwhile, Janakimaiya 2 came here yesterday.
('65', 85, 3, 9, 152099) She had appeared at the Madhyama examination and was mentally relaxed.
('65', 85, 3, 10, 152170) She has been upset since she heard this story.
('65', 85, 3, 11, 152217) She cannot understand for whom you want to burden yourself with this responsibility.
('65', 85, 3, 12, 152302) The sons also do not like the idea.
('65', 85, 3, 13, 152338) And the servants say that since you will now have a mill of your own, you will not ask them to wear khadi.
('65', 85, 3, 14, 152445) Nobody likes your decision.
('65', 85, 3, 15, 152473) Please, therefore, give up this plan of buying a mill.
('65', 85, 3, 16, 152528) If you have already bought it, find some means of saving yourself from this evil.
('65', 85, 3, 17, 152610) Let the partners buy it if they wish.
('65', 85, 3, 18, 152648) If you want to engage yourself in some business, there are many others.
('65', 85, 3, 19, 152720) If you wish to earn more money so that you may spend it for public good, we shall do without such contribution.
('65', 85, 3, 20, 152832) Om 3 asks me whether I have advised you to buy a mill because I need money for the Congress.
('65', 85, 3, 21, 152925) What answer can I give to such questions?
('65', 85, 3, 22, 152967) If you can, send a wire giving the happy news that you have abandoned the plan.

('65', 85, 8, 28, 153228) I am planning from right now.
('65', 85, 8, 29, 153258) As you know, I don’t rely on votes in my favour for doing anything.

('65', 86, 1, 5, 153630) I will continue to ply my charkha, perhaps with increased speed.
('65', 86, 1, 6, 153695) But surely one hand is not enough for clapping.

('65', 86, 3, 12, 153938) 1 Whatever is happening is for the good.
('65', 86, 3, 13, 153979) One gains all this by submitting to God’s will.
('65', 86, 3, 14, 154027) Whatever happens, the mind that has offered up all the acts to the Lord never feels discontented.
('65', 86, 3, 15, 154125) One who is conscious of the “I” is satisfied with nothing.
('65', 86, 3, 16, 154184) Know that this contains all that is worth knowing.
('65', 86, 3, 17, 154235) It is true, of course, that it is difficult to cultivate the attitude of offering up all the acts to the Lord.
('65', 86, 3, 18, 154346) However, if after knowing the truth we ceaselessly strive to follow it in practice our contentment will go on increasing.

('65', 86, 5, 22, 154554) 100. DISCUSSION ON SWADESHI 2
('65', 86, 6, 23, 154584) [Before September 28, 1934]
('65', 86, 7, 24, 154612) Q. How does this new swadeshi differ from the old?
('65', 86, 8, 25, 154663) A. The old emphasized the indigenous nature of the products, irrespective of the method or the produce or the prospects of the product.
('65', 86, 8, 26, 154799) I have ruled out organized industries, not because they are not swadeshi, but because they do not need special support.
('65', 86, 8, 27, 154919) They can stand on their own legs and, in the present state of our awakening, can easily command a market.
('65', 86, 8, 28, 155025) According to the new orientation, if it is new, I would certainly have our swadeshi organization to seek out all village industries and find how they are faring.
('65', 86, 8, 29, 155187) We will have experts and chemists who will be prepared to place their knowledge at the disposal of villagers.
('65', 86, 8, 30, 155297) We will, through our experts, offer to test the
('65', 86, 9, 31, 155345) 1 Omission as in the source 2 This appeared under the title “More Talks on Swadeshi”.
('65', 86, 9, 32, 155431) Mahadev Desai has summarized here the discussion Gandhiji had with a number of persons.
('65', 87, 0, 1, 155519) 88 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 87, 1, 2, 155560) articles manufactured by village handicraftsmen and give them suggestions to improve their wares and would sell them if they would accept our conditions.
('65', 87, 2, 3, 155714) Q. Would you take up any and every handicraft?
('65', 87, 3, 4, 155761) A. Not necessarily.
('65', 87, 3, 5, 155781) I should examine each one of them, find out their place in the economy of the village life and, if I see that they must be encouraged because of inherent merit, I should do so.
('65', 87, 3, 6, 155958) Now, for instance, I should be loath to allow the village broom to be replaced by the modern broomstick or brush.
('65', 87, 3, 7, 156072) I would ask Mrs. Gandhi and other women of the household to tell me about the relative merits of both.
('65', 87, 3, 8, 156175) Mind you, I would consider the advantages from all points of view.
('65', 87, 3, 9, 156242) Thus, the village broom, I should think; must be preferred because it indicates tenderness and kindness to small life, whereas the brush makes a clean sweep of those things.
('65', 87, 3, 10, 156416) Thus, I should see a whole philosophy behind the broom, for I do not think the Creator makes any distinction between minute insects and (in His estimation) minute men.
('65', 87, 3, 11, 156584) Thus I should pick up all kinds of village crafts and industries which are about to die and deserve revival, both because of their intrinsic merit and their other useful aspects, and I should thus go on making discoveries.
('65', 87, 3, 12, 156807) Take our trifling tooth sticks, for instance.
('65', 87, 3, 13, 156853) I am quite sure, if you were to deprive the bulk of the Bombay citizens of their tooth sticks, their teeth would suffer.
('65', 87, 3, 14, 156974) I cannot contemplate with equanimity the modern tooth brush replacing the tooth stick.
('65', 87, 3, 15, 157061) These brushes are unhygienic.
('65', 87, 3, 16, 157091) Once used, they deserve to be thrown away.
('65', 87, 3, 17, 157134) However much disinfectants you may use to sterilize them, they can never be as good as fresh ones.
('65', 87, 3, 18, 157233) But the babul or neem tooth stick is used once for all and has highly astringent properties.
('65', 87, 3, 19, 157326) Again, it serves the purpose of a tongue scraper.
('65', 87, 3, 20, 157376) The West has yet to discover anything so hygienic as the Indian tooth stick.
('65', 87, 3, 21, 157453) You may not know that a doctor in South Africa claimed to have controlled tuberculosis among the Bantu miners by insisting on the regular use by them of these tooth sticks.
('65', 87, 3, 22, 157626) I would be no party to the advertisement of modern tooth brushes even when they are made in India.
('65', 87, 3, 23, 157725) I should declare my preference for the tooth stick.
('65', 87, 3, 24, 157777) This is cent per cent swadeshi.
('65', 87, 3, 25, 157809) If I take care of it, the rest will take care of itself.
('65', 87, 3, 26, 157866) Ask me to define the right angle and I should do it easily, but do not ask me to define the angles between the acutest and the most obtuse you can make.
('65', 87, 3, 27, 158019) If I have the definition of a right angle, I can make whatever angle I need.
('65', 88, 0, 1, 158096) VOL. 65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 89
('65', 88, 1, 2, 158146) swadeshi is eloquent enough as its own definition, I have called mine cent per cent swadeshi, because swadeshi is in danger of being watered down.
('65', 88, 1, 3, 158293) Cent per cent swadeshi gives sufficient scope for the most insatiable ambition for service and can satisfy every kind of talent.
('65', 88, 2, 4, 158422) Q. You see swaraj at the end of it?
('65', 88, 2, 5, 158458) A. Why not?
('65', 88, 2, 6, 158470) Once I said in spinning whcel lies swaraj, next I said in prohibition lies swaraj.
('65', 88, 2, 7, 158553) In the same way I would say in cent per cent swadeshi lies swaraj.
('65', 88, 2, 8, 158620) Of course, it is like the blind men describing the elephant.
('65', 88, 2, 9, 158681) All of them are right and yet not wholly right.
('65', 88, 2, 10, 158729) If we tap all our resources, I am quite sure we can be again the richest country in the world, which we were, I suppose, at one time.
('65', 88, 2, 11, 158863) We can repeat the phenomenon, if we cease to be idle and profitably occupy the idle hours of the millions.
('65', 88, 2, 12, 158970) All we need is to be industrious, not like a machine, but like the busy bee.
('65', 88, 2, 13, 159047) You know I am now advertising what I call ‘‘innocent honey”?
('65', 88, 3, 14, 159108) Q. What is that?
('65', 88, 4, 15, 159125) A. Honey scientifically drawn by scientific bee keepers.
('65', 88, 4, 16, 159182) They keep the bees and make them collect honey without killing them.
('65', 88, 4, 17, 159251) That is why I call it innocent or non violent honey.
('65', 88, 4, 18, 159304) That is an industry which admits of great expansion.
('65', 88, 5, 19, 159357) Q. But can you call it absolutely non violent?
('65', 88, 5, 20, 159404) You deprive the bee of its honey, as you deprive the calf of its milk.
('65', 88, 6, 21, 159475) A. You are right, but the world is not governed entirely by logic.
('65', 88, 6, 22, 159542) Life itself involves some kind of violence, and we have to choose the path of least violence.
('65', 88, 6, 23, 159636) There is violence even in vegetarianism, is there not?
('65', 88, 6, 24, 159691) Similarly, if I must have honey, I must be friendly to the bee and get it to yield as much honey as it will.
('65', 88, 6, 25, 159800) Moreover, in the scientific bee culture, the bee is never deprived of its honey altogether.
('65', 88, 7, 26, 159892) Harijan, 28 9 1934
('65', 88, 8, 27, 159911) 101. SOME CONUNDRUMS
('65', 88, 9, 28, 159932) A Brahmin of Mithila writes a long letter in Hindi, but wants a reply in the English Harijan.
('65', 88, 9, 29, 160026) From his style I can quite clearly see that he knows English well.
('65', 88, 9, 30, 160093) His letter contains questions of universal importance.
('65', 88, 9, 31, 160148) The original is being sent to the editor of Harijan Sevak.
('65', 88, 9, 32, 160207) I gladly give below the substance of the letter.
('65', 88, 9, 33, 160256) The correspondent belongs to an orthodox family, but has shed
('65', 89, 0, 1, 160318) 90 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 89, 1, 2, 160359) all prejudice against Harijans and permits all but those who are manifestly unclean, such as unwashed Doms, to draw water from a well which has hitherto been open only to the so called high class Hindus.
('65', 89, 1, 3, 160563) He says:
('65', 89, 2, 4, 160572) 1. Why don’t you preach to Harijans cleanliness, abstention from carrion eating and the like, just as you preach to caste Hindus removal of untouchability?
('65', 89, 2, 5, 160728) 2. What is the distinguishing characteristic of a sanatani ‘Hindu?, Why do you claim to be a sanatani Hindu?
('65', 89, 2, 6, 160837) 3. You have said that, when a man forsakes his hereditary calling, he creates confusion of caste.
('65', 89, 2, 7, 160935) How far is this consistent with the meaning inferable from the use of the expression 1 in the first chapter of the Gita?
('65', 89, 2, 8, 161056) 4. What have you to say to the verses in the smritis on the marriage of a Brahmin woman with a Shudra man?
('65', 89, 2, 9, 161163) 5. You say there is no superiority or inferiority among the four varnas.
('65', 89, 2, 10, 161236) I believe in what you say, but is it consistent with many texts one can quote from the Shastras which clearly enunciate the opposite?
('65', 89, 2, 11, 161370) See what the smritis have to say of Shudras.
('65', 89, 2, 12, 161415) 6. You say that varna or caste is determined generally by birth.
('65', 89, 2, 13, 161480) You also say that a Brahmin who does not show in his conduct the marks of one falls.
('65', 89, 2, 14, 161565) To what varna does he belong?
('65', 89, 2, 15, 161595) What about a Shudra who shows the mark of a Brahmin?
('65', 89, 2, 16, 161648) 7. It is said that a man becomes what he eats and that he is corrupted if he takes food or even water prepared or even touched by a corrupt person.
('65', 89, 2, 17, 161796) And you say that prohibition against inter dining is not an integral part of varna or caste rule.
('65', 89, 2, 18, 161894) Is that so?
('65', 89, 2, 19, 161906) 8. When workers like me work against untouchability, sanatanist opponents say all sorts of things against you.
('65', 89, 2, 20, 162017) We combat most things.
('65', 89, 2, 21, 162040) But your having taken the life of the dying calf in the Ashram we have not been able to explain.
('65', 89, 2, 22, 162137) Are you able to throw light on this question?
('65', 89, 3, 23, 162183) The original letter is well reasoned and is written with a pure motive.
('65', 89, 3, 24, 162255) I don’t know if I have, in the process of condensation, done
('65', 89, 4, 25, 162316) 1 Bhagavad Gita, I. 41
('65', 90, 0, 1, 162339) VOL. 65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 91
('65', 90, 1, 2, 162389) justice to the spirit in which the original has been written.
('65', 90, 1, 3, 162451) If I have not, the correspondent should know that the injustice is wholly unintended.
('65', 90, 1, 4, 162537) Now for the reply.
('65', 90, 1, 5, 162556) 1. I do preach to the Harijans cleanliness, abstention from carrion eating and intoxicating drinks and drugs, necessity.
('65', 90, 1, 6, 162677) Of taking education themselves and giving it to their children, also abstention from eating the leavings from caste Hindus’ plates, etc.
('65', 90, 1, 7, 162814) Only, I do not put these before Harijans as condition precedent to the removal of untouchability.
('65', 90, 1, 8, 162912) On the contrary, I suggest to caste Hindus that the shortcomings are not inherent in Harijans but that they are due to our criminal neglect of—even deliberate suppression of—these brethren of ours.
('65', 90, 1, 9, 163110) Therefore, the disappearance of these shortcomings will take place sooner for our fraternizing with Harijans even as they are and then helping them to become better men and women.
('65', 90, 1, 10, 163290) That is the least penance caste Hindus can do for the past wrongs.
('65', 90, 1, 11, 163357) We must approach Harijans as penitents or debtors, not as their patrons or creditors extending generosity to the undeserving.
('65', 90, 1, 12, 163483) 2. Belief in, and practice of, varnashrama dharma may be said to be the distinguishing characteristic of Hindu dharma.
('65', 90, 1, 13, 163602) The translation appearing in this Harijan of a Gujarati preface 1 I have written for a collection of my writings on the subject explains what I mean by varnashrama dharma.
('65', 90, 1, 14, 163774) I regard myself a sanatani Hindu, because I try to the best of my ability to obey the eternal precepts of the faith as embodied in the Shastras as I understand them.
('65', 90, 1, 15, 163940) 3. That a person creates confusion of caste when he leaves his hereditary calling is obvious.
('65', 90, 1, 16, 164034) When a Brahmin begins to earn his bread by, say, following the profession of a barber or engineer, he does create confusion of caste, as much as when a barber or an engineer begins to impart religious instruction as a means of livelihood.
('65', 90, 1, 17, 164273) In the Gita, the adjective used in reference to women is ‘wicked’.
('65', 90, 1, 18, 164340) It has, therefore, reference probably to promiscuous intercourse rather than the offspring born of the sacred tie of marriage.
('65', 90, 1, 19, 164467) 4. I do not regard as revelation the collection of verses printed under one cover as smritis.
('65', 90, 1, 20, 164561) I have no doubt that there are many interpolations in the smritis and other scriptural books.
('65', 90, 1, 21, 164655) As I have said often enough in these columns, I reject as interpolations everything in the smritis or other writings that is inconsistent with truth and non violence or other fundamental and universal principles of ethics.
('65', 90, 2, 22, 164878) 1 Vide “ Introduction to Varnavyavastha”, 23 9 1934.
('65', 91, 0, 1, 164931) 92 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 91, 1, 2, 164972) There is abundant testimony in the ancient writings to show that such marriages were permitted.
('65', 91, 1, 3, 165068) 5. This question is answered in the answer to the fourth question.
('65', 91, 1, 4, 165135) The idea of superiority and inferiority is repugnant to the most elementary principles of morality.
('65', 91, 1, 5, 165235) A Brahmin who considers himself superior to any single creature of God ceases to be a knower of Brahma.
('65', 91, 1, 6, 165339) If we are children of the same God, how can there be any rank among us?
('65', 91, 1, 7, 165411) The very first mention of varna in the Vedas likens the four varnas to the four main parts of the body.
('65', 91, 1, 8, 165515) Is the head superior to the arms, the belly and the feet, or the feet superior to the other three?
('65', 91, 1, 9, 165614) What will happen to the body, if these members began a quarrel about rank?
('65', 91, 1, 10, 165689) The law of varna is one of absolute equality among all the creatures of God.
('65', 91, 1, 11, 165766) It is the basis of all the religions of the world.
('65', 91, 1, 12, 165817) The verses in the smritis about Shudras deserve to be summarily rejected as being contrary to the spirit of humanity.
('65', 91, 1, 13, 165935) 6. Both the Brahmin and the Shudra who forsake their svadharma are fallen.
('65', 91, 1, 14, 166010) In their fallen state, they belong to no varna.
('65', 91, 1, 15, 166058) They can repair their mistake by resuming svadharma—their own calling.
('65', 91, 1, 16, 166129) 7. It is insolence for any person to regard a fellow being as corrupt and, therefore, untouchable.
('65', 91, 1, 17, 166228) A man is corrupted by harbouring corrupt thoughts, making corrupt speech and doing corrupt acts, never by taking water or food at the hygienically clean hands of fellow beings.
('65', 91, 1, 18, 166405) I do believe that a man has to choose the ingredients of the food he eats.
('65', 91, 1, 19, 166480) 8. Workers must not seek to defend me against aspersions nor resent them.
('65', 91, 1, 20, 166554) They are the common lot of reformers.
('65', 91, 1, 21, 166592) Aspersions have never hurt any person in the world.
('65', 91, 1, 22, 166644) What hurts is the wicked thing a man does.
('65', 91, 1, 23, 166687) Workers have enough on their hands in having to defend the cause they have taken up.
('65', 91, 1, 24, 166772) I have no sense of shame or repentance over the taking of the life of the dying calf, whose agony I could see but could not alleviate in any other manner.
('65', 91, 1, 25, 166927) I must not dwell here on the ethics of the act.
('65', 91, 1, 26, 166975) If the correspondent or any reader is curious about it, he must procure the writings 1 in Young India and Navajivan of the time when the act was performed.

('65', 93, 4, 7, 168674) I am delaying the matter for a few days because Jamnalalji is not here.
('65', 93, 4, 8, 168746) About Surajbehn, pressure is being brought to permit her to stay in Seva Mandir for six months.
('65', 93, 4, 9, 168842) I am thinking what our duty is.
('65', 93, 4, 10, 168874) Can you suggest a possible line of solution?
('65', 93, 4, 11, 168919) I was taken aback by what I learnt about Satcowriebabu.
('65', 93, 4, 12, 168975) I wonder how that happened.

('65', 94, 8, 12, 169969) MY DEAR GHURYE, I have seen your letter to Sardar Vallabhbhai, and he has handed me the 10 Rupee hundi for which I thank you.
('65', 94, 8, 13, 170095) I shall use the hundi for distributing khadi among deserving Harijans.
('65', 94, 8, 14, 170166) But I do not like your anxiety for name and fame.
('65', 94, 8, 15, 170216) Many have laid down their lives for the country.
('65', 94, 8, 16, 170265) Their names are written in the Book of God, and not in that of men.
('65', 94, 8, 17, 170333) Whatever is written in the books of men is bound to perish one day, and their merit in God,s books is diminished to the extent that the names appear in men’s books.
('65', 94, 8, 18, 170498) Let the public celebration of such anniversaries and public recognition in other forms be reserved for those who are known to fame.
('65', 94, 8, 19, 170630) But let the memory of those who are not so known remain for ever unknown.

('65', 95, 3, 6, 171153) It is not worth attending.
('65', 95, 3, 7, 171180) Nimu cannot be taken to the session where everything would be crowded.
('65', 95, 3, 8, 171251) Women with encumbrances must not visit a place where one has to do with what little comfort comes one’s way.

('65', 97, 5, 8, 173515) September 29, 1934
('65', 97, 7, 9, 173534) I have already told you that I smell impurity in the relation between you and R 2. I told Kishorelal about this and he told Kaka.
('65', 97, 7, 10, 173664) The latter wanted to know clearly what I meant.
('65', 97, 7, 11, 173712) I think it my duty to let you know what I have told him in reply.
('65', 97, 7, 12, 173778) It seems to me that consciously or unconsciously your attraction for each other is like that which obtains between a man and a woman.
('65', 97, 7, 13, 173912) That such attraction may exist unconsciously to oneself is proved by experience.
('65', 97, 7, 14, 173993) It does not necessarily result in action.
('65', 97, 7, 15, 174035) I have tried to find some other cause for your infatuation, but have not succeeded.
('65', 97, 7, 16, 174119) I have clearly observed that your relationship has benefited neither you nor R. It is not at all befitting that, because he has served you personally, you want everybody else to admire him.
('65', 97, 7, 17, 174309) I am doing you no injustice by writing this.
('65', 97, 7, 18, 174354) Even if there is no impurity in you, I would cease to be your loyal co worker if I did not put before you the suspicion that might arise in my mind.
('65', 97, 7, 19, 174503) You should feel neither hurt by what I have written nor get angry.
('65', 97, 7, 20, 174570) Examine yourself and write to me frankly.
('65', 97, 7, 21, 174612) I will believe what you state to be perfect truth.
('65', 97, 7, 22, 174663) I don’t believe that you would knowingly hide any blemish in you.

('65', 98, 4, 12, 175362) 115. THE HARIJANS OF SAJOD
('65', 98, 5, 13, 175389) I have already written in the previous issue something about the harassment of the Harijans of Sajod.
('65', 98, 5, 14, 175491) 2 Now a Harijan from Sajod describes how the Harijan children are being tortured.
('65', 98, 5, 15, 175573) I am not publishing his letter since it contains nothing new.
('65', 98, 5, 16, 175635) It is a good sign that the Harijans have now started writing and talking about the tortures they have been undergoing.
('65', 98, 5, 17, 175754) Right now, I would advise patience to this friend who has written to me and also to other Harijans.
('65', 98, 5, 18, 175854) Some of the so called caste Hindus of the place have been trying to protest against these tyrannies.
('65', 98, 5, 19, 175955) Let the Harijan men and women help them with courage and fearlessness.
('65', 98, 5, 20, 176026) That would do for the time being.
('65', 98, 5, 21, 176060) I often hear of cases where Harijans are afraid to do even this much.
('65', 98, 5, 22, 176130) It happened in Talaja.
('65', 98, 5, 23, 176153) I have just received a letter from Maharashtra complaining about a girl being bodily tortured, but the girl as well as her relatives are not prepared to give evidence.
('65', 98, 5, 24, 176321) They apprehend more harassment if they gave evidence.
('65', 98, 5, 25, 176375) Nor is their apprehension without a ground.
('65', 98, 5, 26, 176419) That is why those Harijans who are prepared to testify to harassment deserve to be complimented.
('65', 98, 5, 27, 176516) It is certain that such harassment is not going to last long, because, on the one hand, caste Hindus are becoming more and more aware of their duty towards Harijans, and, on the other, Harijans are becoming more

('65', 99, 1, 3, 176939) God always takes the side of justice.
('65', 99, 1, 4, 176977) With this faith, let Harijans and caste reformers continue to do their duties.

('65', 99, 3, 6, 177097) 116. SHUDRA BY CHOICE
('65', 99, 4, 7, 177119) A co worker has sent a few questions regarding the varna system out of which I propose to take up only one.
('65', 99, 4, 8, 177227) The question can be thus put in my own words:
('65', 99, 5, 9, 177273) Since you are running after varnadharma please solve some of my problems if you can.
('65', 99, 5, 10, 177358) The Gita describes agriculture, animal husbandry and commerce as the natural functions of the Vaishyas.
('65', 99, 5, 11, 177462) Commerce means selling by one person to another goods produced by a third.
('65', 99, 5, 12, 177537) Or, the seller may produce the goods himself.
('65', 99, 5, 13, 177583) The number of people engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry runs into crores.
('65', 99, 5, 14, 177666) Even so Bharwads 1, Mochis 2, Chamars, and [some] peasants are today regarded as Shudras, whereas according to the definition given above they ought to be all regarded as Vaishyas.
('65', 99, 5, 15, 177847) In my view and yours all the four varnas should be looked upon as equal, living humbly on the same level, not mounted on one another,s shoulders arrogantly crushing those below them.
('65', 99, 5, 16, 178030) But we know our society has a different opinion.
('65', 99, 5, 17, 178079) In these circumstances why should not such peasants, Bharwads, Chamars, etc., as are not employed as labourers but earn their liveli hood by their own independent effort be regarded as Vaishyas?
('65', 99, 5, 18, 178274) The peasant tends his own farm,
('65', 99, 6, 19, 178306) Bharwads and Chamars engage in animal husbandry.
('65', 99, 6, 20, 178355) They are not anybody’s servants.
('65', 99, 6, 21, 178388) If we do not accept them as cattle breeders, then they are traders, in so far as they themselves sell what they produce.
('65', 99, 6, 22, 178509) In no way can they be covered by the definition of a Shudra.
('65', 99, 6, 23, 178570) On the contrary, why isn’t anybody who is a servant a Shudra— whether he is judge or governor, soldier or scavenger?
('65', 99, 7, 24, 178687) 1 Shepherds 2 Cobblers
('65', 100, 0, 1, 178710) VOL.65: 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 101
('65', 100, 1, 2, 178759) These complications are real.
('65', 100, 1, 3, 178789) They crop up because the varna system has broken down.
('65', 100, 1, 4, 178844) The solution does not lie in regarding shepherds, etc., as Vaishyas.
('65', 100, 1, 5, 178913) Would the proud Vaishyas admit in their supposedly exclusive varna those who are regarded as Shudras?
('65', 100, 1, 6, 179015) The above argument is no doubt convincing.
('65', 100, 1, 7, 179058) But justice cannot be administered just by a convincing argument.
('65', 100, 1, 8, 179124) For administering justice one has to reach the bottom and it can be reached only through experience.
('65', 100, 1, 9, 179225) Experience tells us that the varna system has been wiped out.
('65', 100, 1, 10, 179287) So, for the restoration of varnadharma we must all voluntarily become Shudras.
('65', 100, 1, 11, 179366) Of course we are Shudras but only because we cannot help it.
('65', 100, 1, 12, 179427) But there is no merit in an act done out of helplessness.
('65', 100, 1, 13, 179485) It is no act of merit, if I give a few coins to somebody out of compulsion.
('65', 100, 1, 14, 179561) But if I give willingly what I have hitherto given out of compulsion, it would be such an act.
('65', 100, 1, 15, 179656) The same is true of the Shudra varna.
('65', 100, 1, 16, 179694) He who realizes this may belong to any so called higher varna but by considering himself a Shudra he makes a beginning of the restoration of the varna system.
('65', 100, 1, 17, 179853) Let us consider its implications.
('65', 100, 1, 18, 179887) One who has become a Shudra by choice would serve others as a matter of dharma.
('65', 100, 1, 19, 179967) He may or may not earn his livelihood, but with pure heart would devote himself body and mind to service.
('65', 100, 1, 20, 180073) He would purposely restrict himself to marrying amongst and dining with such of the so called Shudras who follow the rules regarding personal cleanliness, etc.
('65', 100, 1, 21, 180233) He would completely identify himself with the class regarded as Shudra.
('65', 100, 1, 22, 180305) He would accept their poverty as far as possible.
('65', 100, 1, 23, 180355) He would try to help them get over their weaknesses.
('65', 100, 1, 24, 180408) Such a Shudra in spite of his possessing spiritual knowledge of a Brahmin, the fortitude of a Kshatriya and the business acumen of a Vaishya would earn his bread only through his service.
('65', 100, 1, 25, 180596) In the varna system each varna may follow the good points of all the four varnas.
('65', 100, 1, 26, 180678) It ought to be so.
('65', 100, 1, 27, 180697) For instance, the smriti enjoins: “Do not kill.
('65', 100, 1, 28, 180745) Speak the Truth.
('65', 100, 1, 29, 180762) Do not steal.
('65', 100, 1, 30, 180776) Follow the path of sanctity.
('65', 100, 1, 31, 180805) Control your sense organs.
('65', 100, 1, 32, 180832) This in brief is the dharma Manu has prescribed for all the four varnas.” (1) Or, “Do not kill.
('65', 100, 1, 33, 180928) Speak the Truth.
('65', 100, 1, 34, 180945) Do not steal.
('65', 100, 1, 35, 180959) Do not yield to desire, anger, greed and be loving and good for all living creatures.
('65', 100, 1, 36, 181045) This dharma is common to all the four varnas”.
('65', 100, 1, 37, 181092) (2) Hence, what distinguishes one varna from another is that its
('65', 101, 0, 1, 181157) 102 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 101, 1, 2, 181199) special characteristics are conspicuously developed in its case and through them alone should the particular varna earn its livelihood.

('65', 101, 5, 6, 181387) AN ODIOUS PRACTICE1
('65', 101, 6, 7, 181407) A friend 2 from Dholka writes: In the voters’ rolls for the Municipal, the Local Boards’ and the Councils’ elections that are being published at present, the names of franchise holders, when they happen to be common folk, are, instead of being put down in full, recorded in an abbrevated form.
('65', 101, 6, 8, 181701) This is, especially in the case of Harijans, an insult to the holders of the names.
('65', 101, 6, 9, 181785) As I perused these lists in the papers, I felt that this was an uncalled for and gratuitous, though unintended, insult to the Harijans which must be stopped.
('65', 101, 6, 10, 181943) I discussed this question with the Assistant Collector in charge of Dholka taluka.
('65', 101, 6, 11, 182026) I understand that instructions have been given to the Talatis in this taluka to reocrd the names of Harijans in full.
('65', 101, 6, 12, 182144) But in other places the odious practice remains in force.
('65', 101, 6, 13, 182202) What is wanted is a general declaration of the official policy in this respect.
('65', 101, 6, 14, 182282) This might at first sight appear to be a trifling matter.
('65', 101, 6, 15, 182340) But it has significance.
('65', 101, 6, 16, 182365) I have no doubt in my mind that the contemptuous way in which these people are treated in their daily intercourse is in some measure aggravated by this practice.
('65', 101, 6, 17, 182527) The correspondent is certainly right.
('65', 101, 6, 18, 182565) By itself the matter might seem to be trivial, but it is one more instance of arrogation of caste superiority.
('65', 101, 6, 19, 182676) It does, therefore, call for prompt attention.
('65', 101, 6, 20, 182723) Apart from injuring Harijan feelings, the use of undignified nicknames in voters’ lists scarecely does credit to our good taste.
('65', 101, 6, 21, 182852) Let us hop that all those who have the service of the Harijans at heart will henceforth scrupulously eschew this objectionable practice and that the authorities will lose no time in taking the necessary steps to discontinue it in the course of administrative routine.

('65', 102, 3, 7, 183513) I am now replying to your letter received today.
('65', 102, 3, 8, 183562) It seems desirable to me that, before we help Harilal to open a store, he should go round selling khadi and that, too, only in Porbandar.
('65', 102, 3, 9, 183700) He himself will not find it convenient to travel from place to place just now.
('65', 102, 3, 10, 183779) Even if you decide to open a store, you should not do that in haste.

('65', 102, 8, 19, 184168) BHAI VITHALDAS,

('65', 102, 9, 21, 184269) Swami has studied them and he says that 40 per cent of khadi proceeds is kept by the trader and the producer gets only 60 per cent.
('65', 102, 9, 22, 184401) If this is correct, we should change it.
('65', 102, 9, 23, 184442) We don’t wish to propagate untruth even unknowingly.
('65', 102, 9, 24, 184495) We should also examine how much of the 60 per cent is received each by the cultivator, the ginner, the carder and the weaver, and publish the figures.

('65', 103, 1, 2, 184746) You have omitted one step in the process.
('65', 103, 1, 3, 184788) It should be shown how much is received by the handloom worker who weaves millyarn.
('65', 103, 1, 4, 184872) And the figures relating to Indian mills are certainly not given in the right manner.
('65', 103, 1, 5, 184958) The payment received by the workers should be shown separately.
('65', 103, 1, 6, 185022) Also, separate figures should be given for mills which use foreign cotton and those which use indigenous cotton and the cost of machinery should be given.
('65', 103, 1, 7, 185177) Moreover, Manibehn told me that an attempt was made once to charge 15 annas a yard for a piece of khadi which was priced at 12 annas a yard.
('65', 103, 1, 8, 185318) But through oversight the original price mark on the piece was left intact.
('65', 103, 1, 9, 185394) The customer noticed it and the dealer, feeling embarrassed, then charged at the rate of 12 annas.
('65', 103, 1, 10, 185493) What could it mean?
('65', 103, 1, 11, 185513) The third complaint is that our prices are the highest.

('65', 105, 9, 19, 188042) It means that he must not be clogged in any way.
('65', 105, 9, 20, 188091) I hope you are keeping well.
('65', 105, 9, 21, 188120) You have said that I had not answered some point in your letter.

('65', 106, 3, 4, 188441) DEAR FRIEND,
('65', 106, 4, 5, 188454) I have your letter for which I thank you.
('65', 106, 4, 6, 188496) It is a most difficult thing for me to interfere in the matter you mention.
('65', 106, 4, 7, 188572) It is essentially a matter for you, local men, to settle.
('65', 106, 4, 8, 188630) In any case, I must not intervene.

('65', 106, 10, 14, 188766) I have your letter for which I thank you.
('65', 106, 10, 15, 188808) It is essentially a domestic matter which the local people should settle.
('65', 106, 10, 16, 188882) In any case, I dare not interfere.
('65', 106, 10, 17, 188917) You can act up to the formula that I have presented—he who has the least chance should retire.

('65', 106, 15, 22, 189109) DWARKANATHJI,
('65', 106, 16, 23, 189123) It is surprising that you did not get my letter.
('65', 106, 16, 24, 189172) I had also returned your long letter with it.
('65', 106, 16, 25, 189218) I had not shown it to anybody, nor had anybody read the reply, though, according to me, there was no necessity for such secrecy.
('65', 106, 16, 26, 189347) I see that all your views have changed.
('65', 106, 16, 27, 189387) What you regarded so long as dharma now seems adharma to you.
('65', 106, 16, 28, 189449) If you are indeed right, maybe all of us are wandering in darkness.

('65', 107, 1, 4, 189749) Let us, therefore, bear with each other.
('65', 107, 1, 5, 189790) Anybody who can do in 14 days what Vishwamitra took 14 years to do, will deserve the humblest reverence from all and his light will not remain hidden.
('65', 107, 1, 6, 189941) I think, however, that you have fallen into grave error.
('65', 107, 1, 7, 189998) I have been trying to lead a life in accordance with the ideals of the Ashram for nearly 50 years now.
('65', 107, 1, 8, 190101) There is likely to be less chance of error in them.
('65', 107, 1, 9, 190153) Dinkar had shown me your letter to him.

('65', 107, 7, 17, 190402) Even so, some of the comforts they enjoy, even the rich do not get.
('65', 107, 7, 18, 190470) Though we have no right at all to such comforts, we get them and so accept them humbly.
('65', 107, 7, 19, 190558) I am writing all this to convince your reason.
('65', 107, 7, 20, 190605) I know of course that by writing the letter you have done, you have only given vent to your pent up feelings, but in fact you are putting up with everything.
('65', 107, 7, 21, 190763) You did perfectly well to give vent to your feelings.
('65', 107, 7, 22, 190817) My duty was to explain to you your duty.
('65', 107, 7, 23, 190858) I have done that.
('65', 107, 7, 24, 190876) Now stop even worrying.
('65', 107, 7, 25, 190900) Let me know if you have any problem.
('65', 107, 7, 26, 190937) Do not in the least feel sorry for writing what you did.

('65', 108, 9, 14, 191813) I see from one of your letters that you have again lost the conviction of guilt.
('65', 108, 9, 15, 191894) You seem to doubt your untruthfulness.
('65', 108, 9, 16, 191933) Do you not realize that you were regarded by the responsible persons as almost a saint, in purity!
('65', 108, 9, 17, 192032) But who am I to judge you, if you cannot yourself?

('65', 109, 1, 4, 192671) I should like merely to glance through it.
('65', 109, 1, 5, 192714) If you send me copies of the original, together with a note containing your recommendations, I would go through them at leisure and send my suggestions.
('65', 109, 1, 6, 192867) I don’t in the least understand the necessity of spending two or three thousand rupees for scrutinizing budgets.
('65', 109, 1, 7, 192980) Yes, if you wish you may call a meeting yourself.
('65', 109, 1, 8, 193030) And if my presence at the meeting is necessary, it can be held here only.
('65', 109, 1, 9, 193104) But whatever is to be done can be done only in November.
('65', 109, 1, 10, 193161) I shall not be able to spare even one minute during this month.

('65', 109, 7, 14, 193320) Your letter is very good.
('65', 109, 7, 15, 193346) Could you not understand my reason for stopping you from coming to Kashi?
('65', 109, 7, 16, 193420) 1 Even as it was, there was quite a large number with me and I had become a burden on others.
('65', 109, 7, 17, 193514) In such a situation, it was not desirable to add to the number even by one.
('65', 109, 7, 18, 193590) By stopping you, I could stop Padma, too, as also Sitala Sahay and his wife.
('65', 109, 7, 19, 193667) If I had taken you along with me, I would have had to take along others as well.
('65', 109, 7, 20, 193748) To me, all are equal.
('65', 109, 7, 21, 193770) Do you understand now?
('65', 109, 7, 22, 193793) If you still have any doubt, ask me.

('65', 110, 3, 4, 194057) HARILAL,
('65', 110, 4, 5, 194066) I have your letter.
('65', 110, 4, 6, 194086) Narandas has been a little hasty.
('65', 110, 4, 7, 194120) I am sending a wire to you today as follows: “Delay spending money received from Narandas.
('65', 110, 4, 8, 194211) Await letter.
('65', 110, 4, 9, 194225) Bapu” 1
('65', 110, 5, 10, 194233) I woke up at 2.30 and started thinking about my dharma towards you.
('65', 110, 5, 11, 194301) I couldn’t go to sleep again and left the bed at 2.45. After cleaning my teeth and drinking warm water with honey, I have set down to write this.
('65', 110, 5, 12, 194447) I want the loan which Narandas may give you to be debited to his private account.
('65', 110, 5, 13, 194529) Till I am quite sure, I do not wish to draw your expenses from a public fund or secure them from friends in public life.
('65', 110, 5, 14, 194650) It would be compromising dharma to do so.
('65', 110, 5, 15, 194692) I do not yet believe in your regeneration.
('65', 110, 5, 16, 194735) I must have independent proof of that.
('65', 110, 5, 17, 194774) I, therefore, do not wish to ask you for an assurance to that effect.
('65', 110, 5, 18, 194844) However, I wish to assure myself through your conduct.
('65', 110, 5, 19, 194899) If you have produced a good impression on Ishvarlal with whom you are staying, ask him to write to me.
('65', 110, 5, 20, 195002) And let me have your own replies to the following questions.
('65', 110, 5, 21, 195063) 1. Have you touched liquor any time after you wrote your first letter to me from there?
('65', 110, 5, 22, 195151) 2. Have you indulged in sexual pleasure through mind, speech or body?
('65', 110, 5, 23, 195221) 3. Do you smoke?
('65', 110, 5, 24, 195238) 4. Have you any other addiction?
('65', 110, 5, 25, 195271) Let there be this understanding between you and me.
('65', 110, 5, 26, 195323) If at any time you break your word to me or if it is proved that you have deceived me, I should fast for at least seven days.
('65', 110, 5, 27, 195449) I may fast even longer, if I wish and have the strength to do so, in case your breach of promise or misdeed pains me very much.
('65', 110, 5, 28, 195577) Though I was still hopeful about you, I had hardened my heart to stone and did not give you any monetary help.
('65', 110, 5, 29, 195688) But I felt from the

('65', 111, 1, 2, 195772) letter which you wrote to me from Porbandar that there had been a change of heart in you and wanted to give you whatever help I could.
('65', 111, 1, 3, 195907) If you have come to have trust in my way of life and my understanding of dharma, you will be convinced of the correctness of whatever demands I make or advice I give.
('65', 111, 1, 4, 196074) Please do not ask me to discuss and explain, but carry out my suggestions as a patient does those of a vaid as so many orders.
('65', 111, 1, 5, 196201) Do not do anything through a feeling that because I am your father you have a special dharma towards me.
('65', 111, 1, 6, 196306) You may have such dharma to help me when I am completely disabled.
('65', 111, 1, 7, 196373) But in this matter treat me as a friend, a vaid and a co worker.
('65', 111, 1, 8, 196438) Why are you so keen on staying in Porbandar?
('65', 111, 1, 9, 196483) It would be convenient for me to help you if you stayed in Rajkot.
('65', 111, 1, 10, 196550) If, however, you decide to stay in Porbandar, I will have no objection to your staying in our ancestral house.
('65', 111, 1, 11, 196661) Is any part of it vacant?
('65', 111, 1, 12, 196687) Does it get good air?
('65', 111, 1, 13, 196709) Till I am satisfied, and Ramjibhai also is satisfied, that you have become steady, please give up the idea of starting a store.
('65', 111, 1, 14, 196837) With the help of khadi samples, you may secure what orders you can in Porbandar.
('65', 111, 1, 15, 196918) If you have come to have the same faith in the spinning wheel and khadi that I have, you should enthusiastically start learning spinning on the takli and the spinning wheel, and spin daily on the former.
('65', 111, 1, 16, 197122) Learn all the antecedent processes also.
('65', 111, 1, 17, 197163) You can do all this more easily in Rajkot.
('65', 111, 1, 18, 197206) Are you ready to live with me and under my eyes?
('65', 111, 1, 19, 197255) I may like you to do that after the Congress session is over.
('65', 111, 1, 20, 197317) Kakasaheb and Kishorelalbhai are here with me.
('65', 111, 1, 21, 197364) And Vinoba also, of course.
('65', 111, 1, 22, 197392) Whatever you do, do after full deliberation.
('65', 111, 1, 23, 197437) Do not do anything that is beyond your strength, nor anything that does not appeal to your heart or reason.
('65', 111, 1, 24, 197545) Do not try to establish good relations with me merely in order that you may be able to live.
('65', 111, 1, 25, 197638) You have been able to do that somehow all these years.
('65', 111, 1, 26, 197693) Doesn’t God provide for everybody, good or bad, in some manner or other?
('65', 111, 1, 27, 197766) But imperfect man must continue to discriminate between good and evil till the end of his life.
('65', 111, 1, 28, 197862) Nobody living in the flesh has become perfect or will ever become, for the marriage of the atman with the material body is in itself a limitation of its perfection.
('65', 111, 1, 29, 198027) Marriage by its very nature is a limitation.
('65', 111, 1, 30, 198072) When the atman becomes a perfect brahmachari, it will no longer create new bodies for itself.
('65', 111, 1, 31, 198166) But why need I take you into all this?

('65', 112, 1, 3, 198287) May God dwell in you.
('65', 112, 1, 4, 198309) He alone is your true Guru.
('65', 112, 1, 5, 198337) “Friends of the body but care for their own interests; they will keep away at the end.” You should, therefore, do as the self within bids you, with God as witness.
('65', 112, 1, 6, 198501) It will not hurt me in the least if you do not accept my advice.
('65', 112, 1, 7, 198566) But it will hurt me very much indeed if you deceive me.
('65', 112, 1, 8, 198622) I am an old man now, and you are not a child.

('65', 112, 8, 17, 198879) I detained the letter asking the writer for permission to send it to you, as it contained statements that appeared to me to be startling and which I was not prepared to believe until I had referred the letter to you.

('65', 115, 10, 15, 202640) It is true that security will have to be offered for whatever he borrows.
('65', 115, 10, 16, 202714) It would not be proper to advise him to enter into such transactions [just now].
('65', 115, 10, 17, 202795) If you think it necessary that he should be given something for his daily expenses on food, etc., and if you can spare money for that, give him what he needs from your private account.
('65', 115, 10, 18, 202980) If you cannot, let me know.
('65', 115, 10, 19, 203008) I will think over the matter.

('65', 116, 9, 13, 204051) Mama 1 will leave the Ashram on the 9th.
('65', 116, 9, 14, 204092) As discussed between us two, I had told him that if he could not subordinate himself to your control, he must leave the Ashram.
('65', 116, 9, 15, 204220) I cannot ask for his expenses from any other source.
('65', 116, 9, 16, 204273) The Provincial Committee, too, would not support an independent institution.
('65', 116, 9, 17, 204350) This argument has appealed to Mama.
('65', 116, 9, 18, 204386) Please, therefore, write to Parikshitlal to pay the expenses up to the date of his handing over control.
('65', 116, 9, 19, 204491) He has been paying the expenses up to now, but I had written to him and asked him not to pay further.
('65', 116, 9, 20, 204593) Though Mama will thus be free from the Ashram, we certainly wish to support him.
('65', 116, 9, 21, 204674) It would be excellent if he settles down in a village and starts working with Bhangis.
('65', 116, 9, 22, 204761) If he does so, we shall have to think later how to meet his expenses.

('65', 117, 11, 16, 205388) I have brought up my sons in the same manner that I was.
('65', 117, 11, 17, 205445) And when they grew up, I treated them [as I was treated].
('65', 117, 11, 18, 205503) When my elders sent me as a guest to their friends in Bhavnagar and Ahmedabad, I had to suffer much more at both places than you have had to.
('65', 117, 11, 19, 205645) I had somtimes to go hungry, but I did not feel unhappy about it.
('65', 117, 11, 20, 205711) What else could they have done?
('65', 117, 11, 21, 205743) Should they have set up a separate establishment for me?
('65', 117, 11, 22, 205800) I learnt much from that experience.
('65', 117, 11, 23, 205836) For Ramdas also, what more should I do?
('65', 117, 11, 24, 205876) He went to Ahmed abad only to be able to live in the Harijan Ashram.
('65', 117, 11, 25, 205945) He is being looked after there very well.
('65', 117, 11, 26, 205987) What did he lack here?
('65', 117, 11, 27, 206010) What more can be done for Nimu?
('65', 117, 11, 28, 206042) Moreover, I am a poor man.
('65', 117, 11, 29, 206069) I beg for whatever I spend.
('65', 117, 11, 30, 206097) However, I go even one step further.
('65', 117, 11, 31, 206134) No matter how poor I am, they get some facilities which even the rich do not get.
('65', 117, 11, 32, 206216) We have no right at all to such facilities, but since we get them we accept them with humility.

('65', 118, 6, 10, 206673) BHAI DEVI BABU,
('65', 118, 7, 11, 206689) You have already heard about the lapse committed by Satcowriebabu.
('65', 118, 7, 12, 206756) Dr. Bidhan states that he himself undertook no responsibility as regards the money matters.
('65', 118, 7, 13, 206848) Therefore he acknowle dges no moral obligation on his part, which is probably right.
('65', 118, 7, 14, 206933) But in my view you and Bhagirathji are certainly responsible.
('65', 118, 7, 15, 206995) If you two feel similarly you should make good the loss of the H. S. S. 1 I think no one could have suspected Satcowriebabu.
('65', 118, 7, 16, 207120) But when I used to have some money in my possession I had done what I am now suggesting you to do.

('65', 120, 5, 12, 209612) KAMALA, You must have received the letter I wrote to you.
('65', 120, 5, 13, 209670) I do wish to come to you but also realize that it would not be right.
('65', 120, 5, 14, 209740) From somewhere or other I manage to get news of you.
('65', 120, 5, 15, 209793) And Feroz 1 sends a daily Postcard since Prabhavati came away.
('65', 120, 5, 16, 209856) Keep up your spirits.
('65', 120, 5, 17, 209878) You should not worry on account of Jawaharlal’s absence from your side.
('65', 120, 5, 18, 209950) It is good that Indu 2 has arrived.
('65', 120, 5, 19, 209986) Tell her to write to me.

('65', 120, 11, 27, 210206) It is a great consolation that you are near Kamala.
('65', 120, 11, 28, 210258) Your letter fills me with hope.
('65', 120, 11, 29, 210290) I expect to hear from you fuller details about Dr. Bidhan’s visit.
('65', 120, 11, 30, 210357) Of course she is in my mind always which means also in my prayer.
('65', 120, 11, 31, 210423) I wonder if she received the long letter which I sent her only a few days ago.
('65', 120, 11, 32, 210502) Prabha writes to her from time to time.
('65', 120, 11, 33, 210542) Please give her the enclosed.

('65', 121, 7, 12, 211034) I liked it.
('65', 121, 7, 13, 211046) I am glad that you have gone to Rajkot.
('65', 121, 7, 14, 211086) If you continue to accept my advice with more and more conviction, your good will be assured and I shall feel supremely happy.
('65', 121, 7, 15, 211213) God has given you sufficient ability.
('65', 121, 7, 16, 211251) It is not too late yet.
('65', 121, 7, 17, 211275) If the heart has become pure, the body also will regain its light.
('65', 121, 7, 18, 211342) I will write more in the next letter.
('65', 121, 7, 19, 211380) I think Bali 1 should be repaid the money that you have spent.

('65', 121, 12, 25, 211596) NARANDAS, I read Sankaran’s letter.
('65', 121, 12, 26, 211632) What he says is not correct.
('65', 121, 12, 27, 211661) Malabar was included in the Harijan tour and I had met both Sankaran and Raghavan.
('65', 121, 12, 28, 211744) I know about Sankaran’s school also.
('65', 121, 12, 29, 211781) He is working with somebody else.
('65', 121, 12, 30, 211815) It is the duty of the local Harijan Sevak Sangh to run that school.
('65', 121, 12, 31, 211883) Ramachandran of the Ashram is now working in it, as also Shyamji.
('65', 121, 12, 32, 211949) There is no reason whatever for Sankaran to leave Malabar.
('65', 121, 12, 33, 212008) A decision to this effect was taken when I met him.
('65', 121, 12, 34, 212060) He was getting enough for his needs.
('65', 121, 12, 35, 212097) In fact there was no need to send him any help.

('65', 122, 1, 3, 212272) I am writing to him.
('65', 122, 1, 4, 212293) I shall enclose a copy of the letter.
('65', 122, 1, 5, 212331) Kanu seems to be doing well.
('65', 122, 1, 6, 212360) I don’t exercise much direct supervision over his work.
('65', 122, 1, 7, 212416) Mahadev and Pyarelal do that.
('65', 122, 1, 8, 212446) What was the cause of so much loss in the dairy?
('65', 122, 1, 9, 212495) On how much production did this loss occur?
('65', 122, 1, 10, 212539) What do you think should be done now?
('65', 122, 2, 11, 212577) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] Shankerlal has come here.
('65', 122, 2, 12, 212629) You should pay a visit to Ahmedabad and see things for yourself.
('65', 122, 2, 13, 212694) I do hope that the loss was not due to carelessness or dishonesty on anybody’s part.
('65', 122, 2, 14, 212779) Though we do not know yet whether the dairy will be run independently or be handed over to the Ashram, its management must be put on a proper basis.
('65', 122, 2, 15, 212928) Harilal has gone there His work seems to be .above board.

('65', 122, 6, 23, 213301) I did not like it.
('65', 122, 6, 24, 213320) I thought that it was agreed between us when we met in Malabar that you were to make your way in Malabar and that you have to be absorbed in the work there.
('65', 122, 6, 25, 213477) I therefore do not understand this desire to go to Gujarat.
('65', 122, 6, 26, 213537) Your sphere is Malabar, and now that Ramachandran is in sole charge of the work, your way should be simple and easy.

('65', 123, 9, 14, 214386) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, I had received your letter yesterday and, as suggested by you, had asked Kishorelal to write to you.
('65', 123, 9, 15, 214505) The pressure of work is fairly heavy.
('65', 123, 9, 16, 214543) I can barely cope with it.
('65', 123, 9, 17, 214570) Every day something is left over.
('65', 123, 9, 18, 214604) Aney came and met me yesterday.
('65', 123, 9, 19, 214636) Nekiram also was here the day before yesterday.
('65', 123, 9, 20, 214684) I suggested that Aney and you could still get together and have a discussion and in case there was a difference of opinion should refer the matter to an umpire.
('65', 123, 9, 21, 214845) As umpires I suggested the names of Bahadurji 2 or Tej Bahadur 3. The suggestion didn’t appeal to Aney.
('65', 123, 9, 22, 214949) He said that the names would go on changing till the scrutiny was over and that, if anything was possible, it could be done only after that.
('65', 123, 9, 23, 215090) This for your information.
('65', 123, 9, 24, 215117) There is one more thing.
('65', 123, 9, 25, 215142) Aney said he would have preferred the elections to take place in November.
('65', 123, 9, 26, 215217) I told him that you did not postpone them just for the sake of Malaviyaji and that if he wired to you, you might extend the time.
('65', 123, 9, 27, 215347) I don’t know whether this is possible.

('65', 124, 1, 2, 215518) I advised against postponement for the convenience of Malaviyaji’s party.
('65', 124, 1, 3, 215592) If Malaviyaji himself desires postponement, it will certainly be an advantage to us in other ways.
('65', 124, 1, 4, 215691) But this matter is beyond me.
('65', 124, 1, 5, 215721) You will find with this a letter from Dr. Gopichand.
('65', 124, 1, 6, 215774) What he says is worth thinking over.
('65', 124, 1, 7, 215811) I will only tell him in reply that I have passed the letter on to you.
('65', 124, 1, 8, 215882) Please look into this carefully.
('65', 124, 1, 9, 215915) I am sending Devdas’s letter also.
('65', 124, 1, 10, 215950) Tear it up after reading it.

('65', 124, 5, 20, 216325) GOPICHAND, I have your letter.
('65', 124, 5, 21, 216356) I appreciate all the information you are giving me.
('65', 124, 5, 22, 216408) I am not interesting myself in individual elections.
('65', 124, 5, 23, 216461) But Lala Sham Lal’s case has somewhat involved me.
('65', 124, 5, 24, 216512) Lala R. P. Singh has sent me a string of complaints against him.
('65', 124, 5, 25, 216577) So I have after getting permission sent the letter to Lala Sham Lal.
('65', 124, 5, 26, 216646) 1 That is the extent of my interest.
('65', 124, 5, 27, 216683) Sardar’s case is different.
('65', 124, 5, 28, 216711) He does interest himself in these things.
('65', 124, 5, 29, 216753) I have therefore sent your letter to him.
('65', 124, 5, 30, 216795) 2 You should also write to him.
('65', 124, 5, 31, 216827) This duel should be prevented if it is at all possible.
('65', 124, 5, 32, 216883) For you, you should be outside this struggle altogether except when you can effectively intervene to prevent a fight.
('65', 124, 5, 33, 217001) The picture you give me of members is sad.
('65', 124, 5, 34, 217044) I am attending the Congress, but I am not going to divide it on the questions raised by me.

('65', 125, 4, 5, 217378) I got your third letter.
('65', 125, 4, 6, 217403) This is my third reply too.
('65', 125, 4, 7, 217431) I did not tell Dinkar that you were indolent.
('65', 125, 4, 8, 217477) After reading your letter to him he asked for monetary help.
('65', 125, 4, 9, 217538) I refused it and told other friends also not to send a single pie, for in your letter you had explained your unmanly intention of doing nothing and letting yourself die.
('65', 125, 4, 10, 217708) I described that as sloth and told him that he would be doing an ill turn to a friend if he encouraged such an attitude.
('65', 125, 4, 11, 217829) You have now entered the third yuga 1. Your letter to Dinkar represented the first, your long letter to me the second and the letter following that the third.
('65', 125, 4, 12, 217988) There is no independent work for Sharma for this year at any rate.

('65', 125, 10, 24, 218348) A correspondent sends a newspaper cutting containing a notice in praise of khadi.
('65', 125, 10, 25, 218430) From it I take the following relevant paragraphs:
('65', 125, 11, 26, 218480) A rupee spent on foreign cloth means one anna and a half to Indians, while annas fourteen plus half an anna go direct into foreign trade’s growth.
('65', 125, 12, 27, 218627) A rupee spent on mill cloth means half the amount for the mill owner,
('65', 125, 13, 28, 218697) 1 Literally, ‘age’.
('65', 125, 13, 29, 218717) The analogy is of the four yugas of Hindu mythology representing progressive physical and moral deterioration in the people during each succeeding age.
('65', 125, 13, 30, 218869) 2 Illegible in the source
('65', 126, 0, 1, 218895) VOL.65: 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 127
('65', 126, 1, 2, 218944) annas six to instruments of production and two annas into foreigners’ pockets.
('65', 126, 2, 3, 219023) A rupee spent on khadi means the whole of the amount minus management expenses—one anna—to the producer alone.
('65', 126, 3, 4, 219134) The sender asks if it is true that every rupee invested in khadi means fifteen annas going to the producers and only one anna going to the salesmen.
('65', 126, 3, 5, 219283) I can only answer that the ideal set before the managers in charge of the A. I. S. A. stores is that the prices should be so regulated as to show on the total sales a surplus, in order to cover expenses, of one anna for every fifteen annas worth of khadi received from the producing depot.
('65', 126, 3, 6, 219573) The fifteen annas will, therefore, include several other items, e.g., freight, etc.
('65', 126, 3, 7, 219657) Hence it is altogether wrong to say that of every rupee invested in khadi fifteen annas go to the producer.
('65', 126, 3, 8, 219765) After khadi leaves the weavers’ hands, it undergoes many processes—washing, dyeing, calendaring, storing in intermediate depots and so on.
('65', 126, 3, 9, 219904) If the term ‘producer’ is confined to the grower, the picker, the ginner, the carder, the sliver maker, the spinner, the bobbin winder, the warper, the sizer and the weaver, but not the workers of the processes after weaving, the producer gets probably no more than eight annas in the rupee.
('65', 126, 3, 10, 220196) It is usual and proper to exclude the other processes, as they are not necessary for fulfilling the purpose of khadi and may or may not have been done by villagers or workers properly so called.
('65', 126, 3, 11, 220391) Washing, dyeing, etc., are often done through organized, i.e., capitalist concerns.
('65', 126, 3, 12, 220475) Now, all those who contribute to the increase in the selling price of khadi do not divide the wages .with the producer, in other words, do not take the bread out of the mouth of the producer, but help him to find a market for his manufacture, and this they do even when they are capitalist concerns.
('65', 126, 3, 13, 220775) For, the latter do not at present work for their profit, but work, no matter from what motive, for the sake of the producer.
('65', 126, 3, 14, 220900) Therefore the whole truth seems to me to be more conducive to the advertisement of khadi than the undoubted, though unconscious or ignorant, exaggeration in the noti ce under discussion.
('65', 126, 3, 15, 221087) If I was the draftsman of the notice, I should say: ‘When you buy a rupee worth of khadi, know that the producer retains the full fruit of his labour, whereas, when you buy cloth manufactured by indigenous mills, you wholly deprive him of that beneficial labour, without providing him with a substitute.
('65', 126, 3, 16, 221391) The agency
('65', 127, 0, 1, 221402) 128 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 127, 1, 2, 221444) that sells khadi gets nothing but the bare living expenses and is, therefore, on a par with the therefore, Thus it will be found that a critical study of the economics of khadi will show that it is a crime against semi starved humanity for any Indian to use any cloth but khadi.
('65', 127, 1, 3, 221723) Such a person takes a morsel out of the mouth of some already famishing villager.
('65', 127, 1, 4, 221805) Khadi suffers, not because of any intrinsic defect; it suffers because of the ignorance of its friends and foes alike.
('65', 127, 1, 5, 221924) But it is necessary to examine the buyer’s case.
('65', 127, 1, 6, 221973) The advertise ment is misleading from his viewpoint.
('65', 127, 1, 7, 222026) Khadi will sell at half the present price, if he will revise his taste, i.e., if he will buy unbleached khadi and put all the ornamentation he likes, afterwards.
('65', 127, 1, 8, 222188) He need not bother his head about it, if the cost is no consideration.
('65', 127, 1, 9, 222259) But let the buyer to whom cost is a consideration know that he pays much less for unbleached and unadorned khadi than for prepared and bleached khadi.
('65', 127, 1, 10, 222410) Moreover, unbleached khadi lasts longer than bleached.
('65', 127, 1, 11, 222465) The public should also know that during the past twelve years khadi has become much cheaper and better in texture.
('65', 127, 1, 12, 222580) It has put more money into the pockets of the individual spinners by improving their tools and increasing their skill.
('65', 127, 1, 13, 222699) This could not have happened, if some educated men and women had not dedicated themselves to the task of helping the semi starved but partially employed millions.
('65', 127, 1, 14, 222862) The one key industry of India which supplemented the agricultural labour would never have died, if the distorted notion of varna or caste had not regarded these millions almost as untouchables, beneath the notice of the self styled higher class.
('65', 127, 1, 15, 223108) No doubt there are defects in the khadi organizations: there is not complete dedication, there is not enough critical study of every problem that demands a solution.
('65', 127, 1, 16, 223274) But this is not a matter of surprise.
('65', 127, 1, 17, 223312) We cannot, in a moment, get rid of habits of a lifetime.
('65', 127, 1, 18, 223369) We cannot, all of a sudden, develop the cunning of the hands The science of khadi requires technical and mechanical skill of a high order and demands as much concentration as is given by SirJ.

('65', 127, 1, 20, 223706) What is then wrong with the notice complained of is not its over valuation of khadi but its clumsy and inadequate presentation of its case.
('65', 127, 1, 21, 223846) And this comes from want of exactness due to inadequate appreciation of truth.
('65', 127, 1, 22, 223925) Every one of the three paragraphs hopelessly fails when tested on that infallible anvil.

('65', 129, 8, 17, 226199) The effect which the fear of that tiger had on the minds of Janakimaiya and the children was a fine revelation of their nature.
('65', 129, 8, 18, 226327) I was very happy to observe that all of them were upset.
('65', 129, 8, 19, 226384) Let us pray that they may always remain what they are.
('65', 129, 8, 20, 226439) You must not leave that place till the doctors discharge you of their own accord.

('65', 130, 3, 4, 227095) BHAI PARIKSHITLAL, I am taking up your letter of 14th September.
('65', 130, 3, 5, 227160) The Rs. 6374 8 3 which I paid to you having been spent, Rs. 80 8 6 now remains.
('65', 130, 3, 6, 227240) If I send that sum, may I take it that no further help will be required?
('65', 130, 3, 7, 227313) Cannot the hostel expenses be met from the yearly budget?
('65', 130, 3, 8, 227371) What suggestion would you make regarding the [estimated] deficit of Rs. 800 at the end of the year?
('65', 130, 3, 9, 227471) It would be desirable now to find all the expenditure from the same account.
('65', 130, 3, 10, 227548) Most of what I receive is sent to Delhi According to me, therefore, what Gujarat does not supply should come from Delhi.
('65', 130, 3, 11, 227669) But that is not necessary with regard to [the needs of] Gujarat.
('65', 130, 3, 12, 227734) We have a guarantee.
('65', 130, 3, 13, 227755) It should be availed of judiciously.
('65', 130, 3, 14, 227792) Meet Narahari and have the position clarified.
('65', 130, 3, 15, 227839) We should become self supporting in the Ashram as far as possible.
('65', 130, 3, 16, 227906) Have you collected rent from Ramdas and others who stayed there?’ Let me know what you got.
('65', 130, 3, 17, 227998) The Ashram should not be made to bear even one pie by way of expenditure on account of anybody who is not a Harijan.
('65', 130, 3, 18, 228115) This does not apply to you, Puratan and others who are there.
('65', 130, 3, 19, 228177) But I suppose your expenditure is being met from the Gujarat Harijan Sevak Sangh.
('65', 130, 3, 20, 228259) Indeed the Sangh should even pay something by way of rent.
('65', 130, 3, 21, 228318) This is necessary for proper accounts.
('65', 130, 3, 22, 228357) However, there can be difference of opinion about this.

('65', 131, 1, 3, 228902) Wheat and other grains are grass seeds.
('65', 131, 1, 4, 228942) Since we don’t have enough patience to plant fruit trees, the poor never get any fruit to eat.
('65', 131, 1, 5, 229037) And the rich don’t eat enough of them.
('65', 131, 1, 6, 229076) They eat fruit only as dessert.
('65', 131, 1, 7, 229108) Being similarly poor in the field of service we are content to sow and reap grass.
('65', 131, 1, 8, 229191) If even a few of us save ourselves from committing this mistake, the fruit trees which grow will give shade and generation after generation will eat the fruits.

('65', 131, 6, 15, 229575) I am writing it for Munshi, however.
('65', 131, 6, 16, 229612) He who follows many ideals worships several gods.
('65', 131, 6, 17, 229662) How can he get peace of mind?
('65', 131, 6, 18, 229692) Gods have been imagined as extremely jealous and quick to take offence.
('65', 131, 6, 19, 229764) The devotee of one god has only one ideal in life.
('65', 131, 6, 20, 229815) He wishes to have vision of only one god of truth.
('65', 131, 6, 21, 229866) Such a man is ever contented and happy.
('65', 131, 6, 22, 229906) If legal practice helps one to realize that ideal, one must practise as a lawyer despite censure by the whole world.
('65', 131, 6, 23, 230023) If, on the other hand, practice of law stands in the way of one’s progress towards the ideal, one must have nothing whatever to do with it.
('65', 131, 6, 24, 230163) Legal practice, voluntary poverty, the Congress throne, people’s criticism—these and many other such things are but so many forms of trust.
('65', 131, 6, 25, 230303) The devotee of one god who accepts praise and censure with an equal mind and lives in comfort in Malabar Hill would be equally happy in an ill lighted chawl in Worli too.
('65', 131, 6, 26, 230474) This is how Munshi wishes to live.
('65', 131, 6, 27, 230509) But it is a mental experiment.
('65', 131, 6, 28, 230540) Why is he, then, afraid about it?
('65', 131, 6, 29, 230574) What has happend to his penetrating intellect and to all his reading of the Shastras?
('65', 131, 6, 30, 230660) If one’s mind is pure one has the Ganga flowing by one’s door step, as they say.
('65', 131, 6, 31, 230741) On the other hand, I have seen many a rogue who has been to Kashi and also bathed in the Ganga there.

('65', 132, 3, 4, 231001) BHAI RAMJI,
('65', 132, 4, 5, 231013) I have read your letter carefully.
('65', 132, 4, 6, 231048) I cannot think of any changes in the programme of studies.
('65', 132, 4, 7, 231107) The problem of khadi can be solved only by a perfect study of the science of khadi.
('65', 132, 4, 8, 231191) It cannot be solved by yielding to the fancies of people.
('65', 132, 4, 9, 231249) Khadi has an important role in times of famine.
('65', 132, 4, 10, 231297) But the inhabitants of a famine stricken area should content themselves with the lowest payment.
('65', 132, 4, 11, 231394) If there is any other occupation through which they can earn more, we should not put the spinning wheel or the takli before them.
('65', 132, 4, 12, 231524) The money received for the purpose of self sufficiency in cloth cannot be given to victims of famine.
('65', 132, 4, 13, 231626) The State or the rich ought to buy up the khadi produced in famine areas.
('65', 132, 4, 14, 231700) Till the rich identify themselves with the poor, khadi can have no place as a means of relief in times of famine.
('65', 132, 4, 15, 231814) Apart from the rich, the other classes cannot consume the khadi produced during famine.
('65', 132, 4, 16, 231902) The poor would be wearing the khadi produced by themselves and the middle classes would buy their requirements in the market.
('65', 132, 4, 17, 232028) There has to be, therefore, extra demand for khadi produced during famine.
('65', 132, 4, 18, 232103) For further explanation, read what I am going to write in Harijan when I get time.

('65', 133, 3, 4, 232400) SARITA,
('65', 133, 4, 5, 232408) I got your long letter.
('65', 133, 4, 6, 232432) I liked it very much indeed.
('65', 133, 4, 7, 232461) It reveals to me perfectly your purity of heart.
('65', 133, 4, 8, 232510) You are acting as befits a true daughter, for such a daughter would not hide from her parents even her thoughts.
('65', 133, 4, 9, 232623) She would frankly tell them what she thought and unburden her heart.
('65', 133, 4, 10, 232692) This would enable the parents to think what they should do.
('65', 133, 4, 11, 232752) You should, therefore, always write to me as you have done this time.
('65', 133, 4, 12, 232822) I would advise you to have patience.
('65', 133, 4, 13, 232859) The result of work is not in our hands.
('65', 133, 4, 14, 232899) What lies in our power is to do our duties.
('65', 133, 4, 15, 232943) The fruit is in God’s hands.
('65', 133, 4, 16, 232972) We, therefore, do not know whether Sumitra will recover.
('65', 133, 4, 17, 233029) We can arrange for her treatment as best as we can.
('65', 133, 4, 18, 233081) It is our dharma to do so.
('65', 133, 4, 19, 233108) We are poor people.
('65', 133, 4, 20, 233128) We should not, therefore, mind suffering what other poor people do.
('65', 133, 4, 21, 233196) Please put up with a little waiting at the hospital.
('65', 133, 4, 22, 233249) I do not know personally any eye specialist there.
('65', 133, 4, 23, 233300) Sardar would know somebody, and he himself has selected Sardesai.
('65', 133, 4, 24, 233366) I am, therefore, getting this done through him.
('65', 133, 4, 25, 233414) I am writing to Swami also and asking him to send me the doctor’s report.
('65', 133, 4, 26, 233488) Sardesai is reputed to be good among the Indian doctors.
('65', 133, 4, 27, 233545) There is a European doctor also who is considered to be good.
('65', 133, 4, 28, 233607) But I don’t feel inclined to send Sumitra to him.
('65', 133, 4, 29, 233657) None of us know him.
('65', 133, 4, 30, 233678) We should not, therefore, leave Sardesai.
('65', 133, 4, 31, 233720) If, however, he finds himself: helpless, we should certainly inquire from some other doctor.
('65', 133, 4, 32, 233813) If you don’t like going to the sea coast, why don’t you take a walk on the terrace?
('65', 133, 4, 33, 233897) That is what I always do.
('65', 133, 4, 34, 233923) The terrace is fine.
('65', 133, 4, 35, 233944) What should I say about Nimu?
('65', 133, 4, 36, 233974) How can I help her if she deceives me?
('65', 133, 4, 37, 234013) If she would speak out frankly as you do, I would be able to do something.
('65', 133, 4, 38, 234088) If she goes on saying “I am all right and don’t worry”, what can I do?
('65', 133, 4, 39, 234159) I even told her yesterday that if she did not want to tell me she could tell Amtussalaam.
('65', 133, 4, 40, 234249) She has no reason to feel worried.
('65', 133, 4, 41, 234284) I have not asked her again to show me the accounts.
('65', 133, 4, 42, 234336) But she should form the habit of keeping accounts.
('65', 133, 4, 43, 234387) It will do her nothing but good.
('65', 133, 4, 44, 234420) Even a millionaire would become bankrupt if he did not keep

('65', 134, 1, 4, 234606) Keep an account of what you have to spend there.

('65', 134, 5, 10, 234886) SURENDRA, For your satisfaction I will draw your monthly Rs. 15 from some other account.
('65', 134, 5, 11, 234975) The matter doesn’t seem to me an important one.
('65', 134, 5, 12, 235023) It may be one’s dharma to draw one’s subsistence from the source from which one is entitled to do so—there may be greater humility in doing so.
('65', 134, 5, 13, 235167) It would be but proper that a person like you should be dependent on Harijans even for his subsistence.
('65', 134, 5, 14, 235271) If, however, you cannot make the service of Harijans the mission of your life and if it cannot give perfect satisfaction to your heart, it is right for you to receive your expenses from some other account.
('65', 134, 5, 15, 235477) Your letter to Kishorelalbhai reveals the state of your mind.
('65', 134, 5, 16, 235539) I still see some confusion lurking secretly in your thoughts.
('65', 134, 5, 17, 235601) You still feel it necessary to choose and decide among alternative courses.
('65', 134, 5, 18, 235677) Such a state of mind can be harmful to spiritual progress.
('65', 134, 5, 19, 235736) He who has offered up everything to Shri Krishna has made his final choice.
('65', 134, 5, 20, 235812) What scope has he for further choice?
('65', 134, 5, 21, 235850) Such a person can sing, along with a man of pleasure: “Enjoy what today brings, for who has seen tomorrow?” Show this letter to Nath 1 and discuss the matter with him.

('65', 135, 3, 7, 236462) I had good hopes of Chhaganlal.
('65', 135, 3, 8, 236494) I had taken him to England to be admitted to a school with fond hopes.
('65', 135, 3, 9, 236565) He had excellent company there.
('65', 135, 3, 10, 236597) It makes me sad that he is not proving a worthy successor to Doctor.

('65', 135, 9, 21, 237050) What is happening is all wrong.

('65', 136, 3, 6, 237671) And at the end of the year if you find any saving you may ask your brothers to remit so much less.
('65', 136, 3, 7, 237770) The point is that one who observes non possession and accepts only a subsistence allowance cannot offer donations out of it.

('65', 137, 7, 10, 239235) The kind of cotton used should be noted.
('65', 137, 7, 11, 239276) All the yarn turned out by the machine should be classified according to the strength, evenness and count.
('65', 137, 7, 12, 239383) All the waste should be weighed.
('65', 137, 7, 13, 239416) The names of the spinners, their ages and sex should be given, and against each spinner should be given the total hours of work per day and information as to the continuous time given by each spinner per day.

('65', 137, 12, 21, 239972) MY DEAR SRIRANGASAYI, I have your letter.
('65', 137, 12, 22, 240014) It is refreshing to know that the Socialist Party in Andhra appreciates all the amendments suggested by me.
('65', 137, 12, 23, 240122) I say the Socialist Party because I take it that your letter is representative of the Party’s opinion as you have signed it in your capacity as Secretary.
('65', 138, 0, 1, 240277) VOL.65: 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 139
('65', 138, 1, 2, 240326) But you know in what unmeasured terms the meeting in Banaras has condemned the amendments.
('65', 138, 1, 3, 240417) Even when I first conceived spinning franchise as a token of the dignity of labour and its universal recognition, a friend had shown me a booklet containing the constitution of the Soviets and drawn my attention to the fact that in Russia labour franchise had a definite place.
('65', 138, 1, 4, 240695) But here I do not know whether you represent the general body of Socialists.
('65', 138, 1, 5, 240772) What about those who have passed the resolutions of condemnation?
('65', 138, 1, 6, 240838) You take exception to my wish that the rich should regard themselves as trustees for the whole of society rather than as owners of the wealth they might possess.
('65', 138, 1, 7, 241000) Of course, it is an uphill task, but by no means impossible.
('65', 138, 1, 8, 241061) Indeed I see definite signs of that idea spreading and being accepted.
('65', 138, 1, 9, 241132) You suggest that the poor should be regarded as trustees for the rich.
('65', 138, 1, 10, 241203) But you forget that it is implied in the proposition I have laid down.
('65', 138, 1, 11, 241274) Because, have I not said that labour is as much capital as metal?
('65', 138, 1, 12, 241340) Therefore, workers, instead of regarding themselves as enemies of the rich, or regarding the rich as their natural enemies, should hold their labour in trust for those who are in need of it.
('65', 138, 1, 13, 241531) This they can do only when, instead of feeling so utterly helpless as they do, they realize their importance in human economy and shed their fear or distrust of the rich.
('65', 138, 1, 14, 241702) Fear and distrust are twin sisters born of weakness.
('65', 138, 1, 15, 241755) When labour realizes its strength it won’t need to use any force against moneyed people.
('65', 138, 1, 16, 241844) It will simply command their attention and respect.

('65', 139, 13, 20, 243215) I wrote a brief reply 1 to your last letter.
('65', 139, 13, 21, 243260) I said in it that I would write more and here it is.
('65', 139, 13, 22, 243313) The nine implications of khadi work which you have explained are correct.
('65', 139, 13, 23, 243387) We can add some more, but these nine are enough.
('65', 139, 13, 24, 243436) Let us immediately start putting into practice whichever of them apply to you and me.
('65', 139, 13, 25, 243522) It was for this reason that I suggested to you to learn Khadi work.
('65', 139, 13, 26, 243590) That means learning all the operations from the sowing

('65', 140, 1, 7, 244139) Narandas’s being in Rajkot is one more reason why I should like you to stay there.
('65', 140, 1, 8, 244222) Moreover, Bali, Manu 1, etc., are also there.
('65', 140, 1, 9, 244268) In your awakened state, you can serve Bali, Phuli and Manu in a great many ways.
('65', 140, 1, 10, 244349) But all this will have meaning only if you can find peace of mind in that way.

('65', 141, 3, 5, 245459) I shall be forced to go, though I do not at all like to go.
('65', 141, 3, 6, 245519) There will be no free tickets this time.
('65', 141, 3, 7, 245560) The lowest charge is Rs. 25. Who will pay that much?
('65', 141, 3, 8, 245613) And how can we permit anybody to pay?
('65', 141, 3, 9, 245651) I have been urging everybody not to go.

('65', 141, 7, 14, 245812) October 6, 1934
('65', 141, 8, 15, 245828) I got your letter.
('65', 141, 8, 16, 245847) In trying to raise 100 to 116, we may have to lose; some even out of 100 1. God never obliges anyone who is excessively greedy.
('65', 141, 8, 17, 245975) On the contrary, He punishes such a person.
('65', 141, 8, 18, 246019) I am more eager to leave the Congress than you are to drive me out of it.
('65', 141, 8, 19, 246093) AII that we have to do, therefore, is to find a way of doing it smoothly.
('65', 141, 8, 20, 246167) I do not know how big the crowd accompanying me will be, but I do like the rule that there will be no free tickets.
('65', 141, 8, 21, 246283) I have always been opposing the practice of elders bringing their children along with them free of charge.
('65', 141, 8, 22, 246390) I, therefore, like that rule.
('65', 141, 8, 23, 246420) But it will be obeyed no better than the rule about khadi.
('65', 141, 8, 24, 246479) You and I, however, shall have to observe it even if we are the only two doing so.
('65', 141, 8, 25, 246562) If you push in Dilip 2
('65', 141, 9, 26, 246585) as a Press reporter and Taramati 3 as a volunteer, the responsibility will be yours.
('65', 141, 9, 27, 246670) God will see that one wheel of your chariot gets stuck into the ground completely If I had my way, I would bring along only Mahadev, Pyarelal, Devraj and Kanu.
('65', 141, 9, 28, 246830) But I shall not be able to have my way.

('65', 142, 7, 14, 247696) God is helping your cart along.
('65', 142, 7, 15, 247728) Do not in the least feel unhappy that you are no longer able to do much service with your own body.
('65', 142, 7, 16, 247828) Your good wishes also are a form of service.
('65', 142, 7, 17, 247873) By itself, the body is inert matter.
('65', 142, 7, 18, 247910) As long as your good wishes remain, you are working through numerous other bodies.

('65', 143, 1, 14, 249432) Even when I had realized that, however, the knowledge was not sufficient to keep me pure.
('65', 143, 1, 15, 249522) But the sense of my dharma to you and to Ba sustained me in my striving.
('65', 143, 1, 16, 249595) Your formal education, however, remained deficient.
('65', 143, 1, 17, 249647) That was unavoidable.

('65', 143, 1, 20, 249796) You have not lost much through that deficiency.
('65', 143, 1, 21, 249844) But in the measure that you feel discontented on that account, I also feel unhappy.

('65', 144, 2, 3, 250651) An esteemed friend writes: 2
('65', 144, 3, 4, 250680) From your recent writing 3 on varna in Harijan it seems that the principle of varna adumbrated by you is intended to apply only to men.
('65', 144, 3, 5, 250816) What, then, about women?
('65', 144, 3, 6, 250841) What would determine a woman’s varna?
('65', 144, 3, 7, 250879) Perhaps you will answer that before marriage a woman would take her varna from her father; after marriage from her husband.
('65', 144, 3, 8, 251003) Should one understand that you support Manu’s notorious dictum that there can be no independence for woman at any stage of her life, that before marriage she must remain under the tutelage of her parents, after marriage under that of her husband and, in the event of her widowhood, under that of her children?
('65', 144, 3, 9, 251313) It is .
('65', 144, 3, 10, 251321) the commonest thing nowadays to find a woman serving as a schoolmistress, while her ‘husband is doing business as a money lender.
('65', 144, 3, 11, 251451) To what varna would the woman under these circumstances belong?
('65', 144, 3, 12, 251515) To what varna between these would their children belong?
('65', 144, 4, 13, 251572) In my opinion, the question raised is irrelevant in the circumstances prevailing today.
('65', 144, 4, 14, 251660) As I have pointed out in the writing referred to, owing to the confusion of the varnas, today there are in reality no varnas, the varna principle has ceased to operate.
('65', 144, 4, 15, 251829) The present state of Hindu society may be described as that of anarchy; the four varnas today exist in name only.
('65', 144, 4, 16, 251943) If we must talk in terms of varna, there is only one varna today for all, whether men or women; we are all Shudras.
('65', 144, 4, 17, 252059) In the resuscitated varnadharma, as I conceive it, a girl before her marriage will belong to the varna of her father, just like her brother.
('65', 144, 4, 18, 252200) Inter marriages between different varnas will be rare.
('65', 144, 4, 19, 252255) A girl will, therefore, retain her varna unimpaired even after her marriage.
('65', 144, 4, 20, 252332) But should the husband belong to a different varna, then, on marriage, she would naturally adopt his varna and relinquish that of her parents.
('65', 144, 4, 21, 252475) Nor need such a change of varna be understood to imply a slur against anybody or touch anybody’s susceptibilities since the institution of varna in the age of resuscitation would imply absolute

('65', 145, 1, 2, 252862) social equality of all the four varnas.
('65', 145, 1, 3, 252902) I do not envisage the wife, as a rule, following an avocation independently of her husband.
('65', 145, 1, 4, 252994) The care of the children and the upkeep of the household are quite enough to fully engage all her energy.
('65', 145, 1, 5, 253100) In a well ordered society the additional burden of maintain ing the family ought not to fall on her.
('65', 145, 1, 6, 253201) The man should look to the maintenance of the family, the woman to household management; the two thus supplementing and complementing each other’s labours.
('65', 145, 1, 7, 253357) Nor do I see in this any invasion of woman’s rights or suppression of her freedom.
('65', 145, 1, 8, 253440) The saying attributed to Manu that “For woman there can be no freedom” is not to me sacrosanct.
('65', 145, 1, 9, 253536) It only shows that probably, at the time when it was promulgated, women were kept in a state of subjection.
('65', 145, 1, 10, 253644) The epithets used in our literature to describe a wife are ardhangana, “the better half”, and sahadharmini, “the help mate”.
('65', 145, 1, 11, 253769) The husband addressing the wife as devi or ‘‘goddess” does not show any disparagement.
('65', 145, 1, 12, 253856) But, unfortunately, a time came when the woman was divested of many of her rights and privileges and was reduced to a status of inferiority.
('65', 145, 1, 13, 253997) But there could be no question of depreciation of her varna.
('65', 145, 1, 14, 254058) For, varna does not connote a set of rights or privileges; it prescribes duties or obligations only.
('65', 145, 1, 15, 254159) And no one can divest us of our duty, unless we ourselves choose to shirk it.
('65', 145, 1, 16, 254237) The woman who knows and fulfils her duty realizes her dignified status.
('65', 145, 1, 17, 254309) She is the queen, not the slave, of the household over which she presides.
('65', 145, 1, 18, 254384) I need hardly say after this that, if the position set forth by me with regard to the role of the woman in society is accepted, the question of the varna of the children will cease to present any problem, as there will be no more any discrepancy as between the varnas of the husband and the wife.

('65', 148, 10, 13, 258252) I was delighted to have your.
('65', 148, 10, 14, 258282) letter and to learn that you were keeping first class.
('65', 148, 10, 15, 258337) I hope that that state will continue till the day of your departure, and that you will reach home hale and hearty.
('65', 148, 10, 16, 258452) Yes, it was well that Charlie was able to get away on the 6th.
('65', 148, 10, 17, 258515) He was going through a terrific strain.

('65', 148, 10, 19, 258614) The Khan Brothers have not yet arrived.

('65', 149, 3, 4, 258917) MY DEAR DEORUKHKER,
('65', 149, 4, 5, 258937) So far as the modification of the communal decision is concerned, the Harijan part of it cannot be modified except with the unanimous consent of all the parties concerned, and I shall be certainly no party to any modification which worsens the position of Harijans Or which has not their consent.
('65', 149, 4, 6, 259234) So far as the elections are concerned, I am quite clear that it would be detrimental to the Harijan cause to involve the Harijans in any shape or form in the fight with the Government in which the Congress is engaged.
('65', 149, 4, 7, 259452) There are many other and more tangible ways open to caste Hindus to show their sympathy, and more than sympathy, to the Harijans.

('65', 149, 8, 14, 259966) He had also requested Gandhiji to reconsider his views on the question of putting up Harijan candidates to contest the Assembly elections.

('65', 150, 3, 5, 260271) You seem to know his case.
('65', 150, 3, 6, 260298) If so, please enlighten me on the matter.
('65', 150, 3, 7, 260340) In reply to his first letter I asked him to define his requirements before forwarding the correspondence to you.
('65', 150, 3, 8, 260453) The postcard is the result.

('65', 150, 6, 11, 260507) I have just received your letter.
('65', 150, 6, 12, 260541) Fix the meeting as early as possible in November.
('65', 150, 6, 13, 260591) After the Congress session my programme will be uncertain.
('65', 150, 6, 14, 260650) I will return to Wardha immediately after the session.
('65', 150, 6, 15, 260705) Show me the accounts then.
('65', 150, 6, 16, 260732) I am of the view that the rich among the workers should pay off the sum connected with Satcowriebabu.
('65', 150, 6, 17, 260834) About excusing the members, consult Ghanshyamdas.
('65', 150, 6, 18, 260884) However gently, they must be informed.
('65', 150, 6, 19, 260923) I certainly believe that if it is our duty to ask Surajbehn to vacate, there is no room for mercy in performing it.
('65', 150, 6, 20, 261039) I wish to return to Wardha on November 1 at the latest.
('65', 150, 6, 21, 261095) But it will be as Rama wills.
('65', 150, 6, 22, 261125) Tour Kathiawar after the meeting here.
('65', 150, 6, 23, 261164) Parikshitlal’s Rs. 31 were sent by Radhakisan ten days ago.
('65', 150, 6, 24, 261224) We are inquiring why he did not receive the sum.

('65', 151, 1, 3, 261536) If you can come with Dr. Ansari, do come.
('65', 151, 1, 4, 261578) I have received numerous wires regarding Ishwar Sharan 1. I didn’t send the others to you, but I am sending Baba Raghavdas’s with this.
('65', 151, 1, 5, 261714) Ishwar Sharan is opposed by Krishnakant 2. Aney has suggested that the latter may be replaced by Chintamani 3 and Ishwar Sharan should be asked to withdraw, and that Bhagwandas may not be opposed.
('65', 151, 1, 6, 261911) This seems to me worth doing if it can be managed.
('65', 151, 1, 7, 261962) In any case, Ishwar Sharan should withdraw in favour of Chintamani.
('65', 151, 1, 8, 262030) Opposition to Bhagwandas will create much bitterness.
('65', 151, 1, 9, 262084) I have sent you a wire 4 regarding this.
('65', 151, 1, 10, 262125) Next about Abhyankar.
('65', 151, 1, 11, 262147) After I had sent that wire, I received the accompanying letter from Bapuji.
('65', 151, 1, 12, 262223) I, therefore, need not take your time trying to explain the reasoning behind that wire.
('65', 151, 1, 13, 262311) I had long wires from Nariman and Mathuradas pleading against postponement of the Congress.
('65', 151, 1, 14, 262403) The expenditure was unneces sary.
('65', 151, 1, 15, 262437) I am not at all keen on postponement.
('65', 151, 1, 16, 262475) I merely acted as a postman.
('65', 151, 1, 17, 262504) Surely, neither you nor I can be a party to anything that might harm the Congress or the Parliamentary Board.
('65', 151, 1, 18, 262614) And, moreover, I can’t judge about these things from my retreat here.
('65', 151, 1, 19, 262684) The Khan Brothers have got stuck in Bengal.
('65', 151, 1, 20, 262728) It has become extremely difficult now to persuade them to go to Bombay on the 19th.
('65', 151, 1, 21, 262812) What can we do?
('65', 151, 1, 22, 262828) I have, of course, written 5. I am very much afraid that you might fall ill.
('65', 151, 1, 23, 262905) However, I remember the case of William, the Prince of orange.
('65', 151, 1, 24, 262968) As long as God wanted him to live and serve, he remained unharmed even in the midst of a shower of bullets.

('65', 152, 4, 9, 263580) No, you must not [come] back here to take your penance.
('65', 152, 4, 10, 263636) You will be received with open arms when the sense of sin is self evident.
('65', 152, 4, 11, 263711) Your letter is evidence of the contrary.
('65', 152, 4, 12, 263752) You have not even the honesty to say to those concerned what you have actually done, if only to guide them in future.
('65', 152, 4, 13, 263870) You must come down [your] pedestal before you can realize the enormity of the treble sin.
('65', 152, 4, 14, 263960) Remember a fellow sinner is speaking to you.
('65', 152, 4, 15, 264005) Only I have the sense of sin and I fly from it.

('65', 153, 8, 14, 265085) I have arranged the money for you from Ramachandran.
('65', 153, 8, 15, 265138) My relations with him are such that I need not hesitate about this and this is quite the right thing to do for you as well as for me.
('65', 153, 8, 16, 265272) When he is there it does not look nice to send money direct from here.
('65', 153, 8, 17, 265343) I shall certainly return it to him so you may draw the money without hesitation.
('65', 153, 8, 18, 265424) If you do not find it enough, write to me.
('65', 153, 8, 19, 265467) It is very good that you keep account of each and every pie.
('65', 153, 8, 20, 265528) I understand the state of your mind which you so vividly describe.
('65', 153, 8, 21, 265595) Don’t force yourself to do anything.
('65', 153, 8, 22, 265632) Place your foot only where you can plant it firmly knowing all that is happening around you.
('65', 153, 8, 23, 265725) It has been my experience throughout that nothing that is done in an unnatural manner endures, but that instead there is only increase in hypocrisy.

('65', 154, 1, 5, 266197) He will correct them and go ahead.

('65', 154, 1, 7, 266283) I have been trying to help him.
('65', 154, 1, 8, 266315) He has come to Rajkot.
('65', 154, 1, 9, 266338) He had asked for your address which I have sent to him.
('65', 154, 1, 10, 266394) If you wish to read his recent letters to me, I shall send them to you.
('65', 154, 1, 11, 266466) Contrary to my practice nowadays I am preserving his letters.

('65', 154, 1, 13, 266614) Your decision to do [regular] spinning is no doubt a good one.
('65', 154, 1, 14, 266677) The new method with the takli is very good.
('65', 154, 1, 15, 266721) 400 rounds can be spun per hour by adopting this method.
('65', 154, 1, 16, 266778) A speed of 200 rounds per hour is common with this method; do try it.
('65', 154, 1, 17, 266848) You must have read the article on the subject.
('65', 154, 1, 18, 266895) That you should ask for slivers from here is contrary to logic.
('65', 154, 1, 19, 266959) It is like a shave costing more than a head.
('65', 154, 1, 20, 267004) You ought to do your own carding.

('65', 154, 1, 23, 267126) Ramachandran must know because he was connected with khadi work.
('65', 154, 1, 24, 267191) No doubt good quality cotton is available there.
('65', 154, 1, 25, 267240) The best cotton is grown in Tinnevelly and it is not far from Nagercoil.
('65', 154, 1, 26, 267313) You might have started taking ghee and milk.

('65', 155, 8, 10, 268232) I have your letter.
('65', 155, 8, 11, 268252) As to the Ashram at Delhi, the fact that there is the other Central one should not be overemphasized.
('65', 155, 8, 12, 268354) There should be an ashram or institution at the headquarters, and the idea is that the office should be taken there, with accommodation for the whole of the staff, and provision for a technical institute.
('65', 155, 8, 13, 268559) If the provinces can raise sufficient money for themselves, each of them can certainly have such training centres.
('65', 155, 8, 14, 268674) Karachi has almost a model institute where, under first class expert guidance, all kinds of articles are manufactured from leather.
('65', 155, 8, 15, 268806) Sewing is also done there, and the ground is exceedingly well kept.
('65', 155, 8, 16, 268874) The whole thing is due to the enterprise of Mohatta Bros.
('65', 155, 8, 17, 268932) Now it has become so popular that even non Harijans are applying for admission.
('65', 155, 8, 18, 269012) Therefore, the idea of the Delhi institute is not in conflict with yours, but on the contrary it is in support of yours—only Delhi can’t find the funds for other centres.
('65', 155, 8, 19, 269183) Bangalore is also developing such things.
('65', 155, 8, 20, 269225) Kathiawar has three.
('65', 155, 8, 21, 269246) But they were there prior to the establishment of the Harijan Board, and they have now come under the influence of the Central Board.
('65', 155, 8, 22, 269380) The establishment of an institute at Delhi was an idea conceived by Ghanshyamdas before Sabarmati was given [over].
('65', 155, 8, 23, 269496) It is, and will remain, an all India concern.
('65', 155, 8, 24, 269542) Whether it will be so in fact depends largely upon what the management is able to make of it.
('65', 155, 8, 25, 269636) I do not sup pose we shall get in the near future over 100 acres of land and buildings worth over two lakhs.
('65', 155, 8, 26, 269745) In acreage the Delhi plot is nothing, but the situation is very good.
('65', 155, 9, 27, 269815) 1 The message was sent through S. Satyamurthi.
('65', 156, 0, 1, 269862) VOL.65: 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 157
('65', 156, 1, 2, 269911) Ghanshyamdas wants to develop the scheme after his own fashion, and to spend a lot of his substance on it.
('65', 156, 1, 3, 270018) I do hope that my proposal 1 to Devibabu and Bhagirathji will be accepted and that we shall not have to lose the money Satcowriebabu has taken away.
('65', 156, 1, 4, 270167) It is an unfortunate incident which should be redressed so far as it is possible.
('65', 156, 1, 5, 270249) The paragraph you quote from McCarrison is very interesting.
('65', 156, 1, 6, 270310) McCarrison I have found to be a reliable writer, but he is somewhat hasty in generalizing.
('65', 156, 1, 7, 270401) I have had considerable correspondence with him.
('65', 156, 1, 8, 270450) Are you not sweeping in your statement that starch is identified with sugar as a food?
('65', 156, 1, 9, 270537) Now sugar can be given with impunity to babies.
('65', 156, 1, 10, 270585) I have never heard that starch can be given to them with equal impunity.
('65', 156, 1, 11, 270658) Then, starch can never be taken without cooking.
('65', 156, 1, 12, 270707) Sugar requires no cooking.
('65', 156, 1, 13, 270734) And even if rice is cooked, surely you do not claim the same value for rice as you would for raisins from the point of view of harmlessness.
('65', 156, 1, 14, 270875) I am testing just now the effect of unboiled milk, fresh from the udder.
('65', 156, 1, 15, 270948) I have heard so much in praise of unboiled milk that I want to try its effect myself.
('65', 156, 1, 16, 271034) The only difficulty is that you can’t take all the milk that you want to at one meal.
('65', 156, 1, 17, 271120) You have to divide it, and you can’t get the goats or the cows, as the case may be, to yield the milk whenever you want to milk them.
('65', 156, 1, 18, 271254) The question then is: Does unboiled milk retain its full quality throughout the day if you stored it in ice or kept in a corked bottle with a wet towel wrapped round it?
('65', 156, 1, 19, 271424) I have tried it myself.
('65', 156, 1, 20, 271448) The: milk retains the full flavour.
('65', 156, 1, 21, 271484) Whether it retains the full quality, I have no knowledge.
('65', 156, 1, 22, 271542) If you can throw light upon it, please do.
('65', 156, 1, 23, 271585) I shall watch the development of your researches about the full use of all the parts of carcasses.

('65', 157, 10, 19, 272626) Therefore, you must excuse me for my utter inability to give you my personal support in your candidature.
('65', 157, 10, 20, 272732) Thank you for your inquiry about my health.

('65', 158, 3, 5, 273070) If it is at all possible I would certainly like to take the burden of a part of his allowance from the Central Board.
('65', 158, 3, 6, 273188) I have so completely relied upon Sastri that I have not even looked upon the financial position.
('65', 158, 3, 7, 273285) I know that it is wrong on my part not to do so.
('65', 158, 3, 8, 273334) But sheer force of circumstances has prevented my doing many things that I would have loved to do.
('65', 158, 3, 9, 273433) Now I think that you should also formally demand the accounts in order that you can satisfy yourself as to whether the assistance given by the Board is necessary or not.
('65', 158, 3, 10, 273603) You have every right to do so.

('65', 158, 7, 15, 273726) DEAR FRIEND, I prize your letter.
('65', 158, 7, 16, 273760) All these days I have pined to write to you about Ambujam 1. But a delicate sense of consideration for you has restrained me.
('65', 158, 7, 17, 273886) Your letter gives me an opening and much relief.
('65', 158, 7, 18, 273935) You know my affection towards Ambujam.
('65', 158, 7, 19, 273974) If it is not a presumption I may say I have felt towards her even as you have.
('65', 158, 7, 20, 274053) It has been a rare privilege of my life to be able to occupy a place of confidence in several families.
('65', 158, 7, 21, 274157) What little influence I have had over Ambujam has been exerted to persuade her to do nothing that could displease either of you.
('65', 158, 7, 22, 274286) I think she has listened to my advice.
('65', 158, 7, 23, 274325) I look forward to reviving old sweet memories when we meet.

('65', 159, 10, 13, 275115) I have your letter.
('65', 159, 10, 14, 275135) I had received Harilal’s before I got yours, that is, yesterday.
('65', 159, 10, 15, 275200) He says in it that you have lost some money and that you may even have to draw something [from the Ashram funds] to meet your monthly expenses.
('65', 159, 10, 16, 275344) I shall not be shocked if this is true.
('65', 159, 10, 17, 275384) I have often sung, “It is a blessing indeed that the snare was destroyed, for I have seen Shri Gopal with little effort.” If you find it necessary to draw any money for your expenses, by all means do so.

('65', 162, 2, 3, 278329) Rajasaheb Kalakanker, whose untimely death was announced week before last, was a great Harijan sevak.
('65', 162, 2, 4, 278431) He was ailing for nearly a year.
('65', 162, 2, 5, 278464) I could hardly recognize him when I saw him last in Calcutta, where he was undergoing treatment.
('65', 162, 2, 6, 278561) He was a most liberal minded zamindar of U. P. It can be truly said of him that he lived for his ryots to the best of his ability.
('65', 162, 2, 7, 278692) His tastes were simple.
('65', 162, 2, 8, 278716) He mixed freely with people.
('65', 162, 2, 9, 278745) His love for Harijans was no less than for others.
('65', 162, 2, 10, 278796) He endeavoured by his open example to have caste Hindus of his zamindari abolish untouchability and let Harijans enjoy the same rights as they themselves enjoyed.
('65', 162, 2, 11, 278959) All schools, wells, temples under his own direct management were freely thrown open to Harijans.
('65', 162, 2, 12, 279056) Let us hope that the bereaved Ranisaheba and other members of Kalakanker’s family will carry out the noble traditions bequeathed by him and thus perpetuate the Rajasaheb’s memory.

('65', 162, 5, 15, 279276) Harijan servants have need to exercise the greatest forbearance at this time of their trial.
('65', 162, 5, 16, 279369) The Temple entry Bill is gone.
('65', 162, 5, 17, 279400) The sanatanists are jubilant.
('65', 162, 5, 18, 279430) We must not mind their joy.
('65', 162, 5, 19, 279458) Only yesterday we were what they are today.
('65', 162, 5, 20, 279502) We may not hate them.
('65', 162, 5, 21, 279524) We must love them.
('65', 162, 5, 22, 279543) Let the reformers treasure the following lines a sister sends me from AE.’s 2 Interpreters, which she venerates almost as a devout Christian his Bible.
('65', 162, 5, 23, 279695) These are the beautiful lines:
('65', 162, 6, 24, 279726) Love and hate have a magical transforming power.
('65', 162, 6, 25, 279775) They are the great soul changers.
('65', 162, 6, 26, 279809) We grow through their exercise into the likeness of what we contemplate.
('65', 162, 6, 27, 279882) By intensity of hatred, nations create in themselves the character they imagine in their enemies.
('65', 162, 6, 28, 279980) Hence it comes that all passionate conflicts result in an interchange of characteristics.
('65', 162, 6, 29, 280070) We might say, with truth, that those who hate open a door by which their enemies enter and make their own the secret place of the heart.

('65', 163, 1, 2, 280418) Love is the only thing that can transform sanatanists.
('65', 163, 1, 3, 280473) Let us realize that they are what they are, in spite of themselves.
('65', 163, 1, 4, 280541) We have no right to judge them or become impatient with them.
('65', 163, 1, 5, 280603) Surely, it is enough if we are true to ourselves, that is, if we act up to our belief and render full twenty shillings in the pound to the Harijans.
('65', 163, 1, 6, 280752) Again, let us realize that in their victory lies their defeat; in our humiliation lies our victory.
('65', 163, 1, 7, 280852) Sanatanists can no longer plead the Temple entry Bill in defence of their opposition to the entry of Harijans to our temples by our common consent.
('65', 163, 1, 8, 281000) Reformers can now prosecute the temple entry question with re doubled zeal.
('65', 163, 1, 9, 281076) The reformers would sin, if they felt that the burial of the Bill meant the burial of the temple entry movement.
('65', 163, 1, 10, 281189) It is not so.
('65', 163, 1, 11, 281203) Wherever we can, without bitterness, have temples opened by the consent of sanatanists, we must do so.
('65', 163, 1, 12, 281306) It is possible that those who were holding themselves aloof from the temple entry movement, on account of the Temple entry Bill being prosecuted, will, now that it is out of the way, join the movement to have them opened without the aid of the law.
('65', 163, 1, 13, 281555) For, be it remembered that the Bill is not dead, it is only suspended.
('65', 163, 1, 14, 281626) Legislation has to come, if sanatanists do not heartily co operate with the reformers in having temples opened to Harijans precisely on the same terms as to caste Hindus.

('65', 163, 3, 17, 281842) The Maharashtra branch of the A. I. S. A., whose head office is situated in Wardha, has at my request furnished me with some most instructive figures about the incidence of the distribution of every rupee spent on khadi among the various persons engaged in the manufacture and distribution of khadi.
('65', 163, 3, 18, 282142) The following are the figures for white khadi of 10 to 14 counts of yarn: Rs. A. P. Farmer for cotton 0 4 6 Ginning 0 0 6 Carding 0 1 0 Spinning 0 3 6 Weaving 0 4 0 Freight 0 0 8
('65', 164, 0, 1, 282321) VOL.65: 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 165
('65', 164, 1, 2, 282370) Bleaching 0 0 8 Management 0 1 2
('65', 164, 3, 3, 282403) This khadi constitutes roughly 50 per cent of the stock.
('65', 164, 3, 4, 282460) Therefore, on that quantity, the management gets only one anna two pies (0 1 2) in the rupee worth of khadi and workers up to the weaver Rs. 0 13 6 in the rupee.
('65', 164, 3, 5, 282622) It is satisfactory to note that the farmer, the spinner and the weaver get the largest portion among themselves.
('65', 164, 3, 6, 282735) In the higher counts, the farmer gets much less and the spinner tops the list.
('65', 164, 3, 7, 282814) But the incidental charges increase.
('65', 164, 3, 8, 282851) They go as high as 25 per cent.
('65', 164, 3, 9, 282883) Then, again, on fancy articles there may be cent per cent increase on khadi.
('65', 164, 3, 10, 282960) Indeed, in the cost of khadi in a fancy kerchief costing one rupee, the portion going to Daridranarayana may be only half an anna or less.
('65', 164, 3, 11, 283099) For socks or stockings made of hand spun yarn on tiny hand machines, the cost of yarn would be trifling.
('65', 164, 3, 12, 283204) The cost of an Andhra sari, as it may come from Andhra, may be Rs. 25, and it may be sold after fancy work done on it at Rs. 150. The moral is obvious: the simpler the khadi, the larger the amount that goes into the pockets of the poorest workers.
('65', 164, 3, 13, 283452) The fancy work no doubt makes khadi popular in homes which could not otherwise look at it.
('65', 164, 3, 14, 283543) I may add also that there are some popular varieties of saris and dhotis manufactured for poor people.
('65', 164, 3, 15, 283646) On these no management charges are at all added.
('65', 164, 3, 16, 283695) And there is no such thing as net profit in any of the numerous stores managed by the A. I. S. A. The management charges are added in order to make khadi self supporting.
('65', 164, 3, 17, 283866) This has not yet happened.
('65', 164, 3, 18, 283893) The Committee of the A. I. S. A. is constantly taxing itself so as to reduce prices and to make the management so efficient as to bring down the expenses to a minimum.

('65', 165, 1, 3, 284458) I had not intended to scold you; I did intend to warn you.
('65', 165, 1, 4, 284517) But I suppose it is now a forgotten thing.
('65', 165, 1, 5, 284560) Moreover you are a happy family again.
('65', 165, 1, 6, 284599) You will be happier for the blowing up, and I see that Agatha has been writing nicely about you all along in her correspondence to the Indian newspapers.
('65', 165, 1, 7, 284753) I am looking forward to a recital of your experiences in America.
('65', 165, 1, 8, 284819) It was a good thought on your part to have written to Dr. Holmes and to have gone to America.
('65', 165, 1, 9, 284913) It was an experience you certainly needed.
('65', 165, 1, 10, 284956) I understand your scheme about things in England.
('65', 165, 1, 11, 285006) We must discuss that when we meet.
('65', 165, 1, 12, 285041) Therefore I do not propose to give any opinion Just now.
('65', 165, 1, 13, 285098) Things are shaping themselves here.
('65', 165, 1, 14, 285134) I do not know what is going to happen.
('65', 165, 1, 15, 285173) My mind is certainly set on going out of the Congress.
('65', 165, 1, 16, 285228) I feel quite sure that it will do good to the Congress and to me.
('65', 165, 1, 17, 285294) I shall better influence the Congress by being outside.
('65', 165, 1, 18, 285350) I shall cease to be the weight that I am just now, and yet I shall be passing my views on to the Congress whenever occasion demands it.
('65', 165, 1, 19, 285486) I must not give my time to writing about these things.
('65', 165, 1, 20, 285541) These have to be attended to by Mahadev and Pyarelal.
('65', 165, 1, 21, 285595) Every minute just now counts.

('65', 165, 7, 27, 285753) MY DEAR TITUS,
('65', 165, 8, 28, 285768) I have your long letter.
('65', 165, 8, 29, 285793) I am glad you have written at Iength.
('65', 165, 8, 30, 285831) I am in correspondence with Narandas and others regarding the dairy.
('65', 165, 8, 31, 285900) I would like to study the figures showing how the loss was incurred.
('65', 165, 8, 32, 285969) Your asking me to make arrangements for you in anticipation of your severing the connection with the dairy is altogether premature.
('65', 165, 8, 33, 286101) The dairy is not to be given up light heartedly, and if it has got to be given up, surely there must be something wrong with the management.
('65', 165, 8, 34, 286242) Therefore, if you have confidence in yourself, you should make it
('65', 166, 0, 1, 286308) VOL.65: 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 167
('65', 166, 1, 2, 286357) impossible to give up the dairy.
('65', 166, 1, 3, 286390) Your suggestions about the rearran gement are worthy of consideration.
('65', 166, 1, 4, 286461) I must discuss these suggestions with Narandas and Shankerlal, possibly Narahari also.
('65', 166, 1, 5, 286548) I shall then be better able to form a decisive judgment.
('65', 166, 1, 6, 286605) I agree with you that you should separate the useless cattle from the useful ones.
('65', 166, 1, 7, 286688) As soon as I have a definite scheme, I shall approach the pinjrapole people.
('65', 166, 1, 8, 286765) Indeed Narandas can do so himself, and I may come on the scene later if it becomes at all necessary.
('65', 166, 1, 9, 286866) The most serious news, however, that I have about the dairy is a letter from Surendraji saying that the cattle are looking most miserable, some of them are skin and bone.
('65', 166, 1, 10, 287037) It seems to me to be unbelievable.
('65', 166, 1, 11, 287072) I would like you, therefore, to set my mind at rest on this point, and discuss with Surendraji and know from him the full meaning of his statement.
('65', 166, 1, 12, 287220) I am glad that your wife has become acclimatized, and that she is of great assistance to you in your work.

('65', 171, 1, 3, 293143) This is surely a difficult task.

('65', 171, 5, 14, 293592) MY DEAR AMBUJAM, You have filled me with deep anxiety, and I have not known what to do.
('65', 171, 5, 15, 293680) In my despair I sent a long telegram to Harihara Sharma.
('65', 171, 5, 16, 293737) At first I thought I would wire to Father.
('65', 171, 5, 17, 293780) Then I became afraid lest he should be angry and your position should become more awkward than it already is.
('65', 171, 5, 18, 293890) Though I have not interfered with your fast, I have not felt happy over it.
('65', 171, 5, 19, 293966) However, I do hope that it ended without any injury to the body, and that you were enjoying inward happiness during the fast.
('65', 171, 5, 20, 294092) You must not give way to despair if even the fast has not induced the parents to grant you the permission to come to me.
('65', 171, 5, 21, 294213) You must try again and again but no more fasting should be undertaken.
('65', 171, 5, 22, 294284) You should try to deserve their permission by your correct conduct and patient argument with them.
('65', 171, 5, 23, 294383) I am sure that they will listen to your request when they realize that it is not in a momentary fit that you have desired to come to me, but that it is a longing of the soul which you dare not suppress.
('65', 171, 5, 24, 294586) 2 I do hope that you will listen to me.

('65', 172, 3, 4, 294928) DEAR FRIEND,
('65', 172, 4, 5, 294941) I had your letter.
('65', 172, 4, 6, 294960) I am sorry I was not able to reply earlier.
('65', 172, 4, 7, 295004) In view of Thakkar Bapa’s letter to you, there is nothing more for me to say.
('65', 172, 4, 8, 295082) If the Aborigines Conference has got to be held, it must be held in a quieter atmosphere, and by men who are earnest about it, know something of the question and have the desire and the leisure to work for the cause.

('65', 172, 9, 14, 295466) October 15, 1934
('65', 172, 10, 15, 295483) So much has been written in the Press regarding my proposed retirement from the Congress that it has become necessary to state the position as it occurs to me today.
('65', 172, 10, 16, 295649) No doubt is left on my mind that many Congressmen do not like my proposals 1 to make the Article regarding the habitual wearing of khaddar stiffer and a more workable spinning franchise compulsory and replace by the words “truthful and non violent” the words “peaceful and legitimate” in the Congress creed.
('65', 172, 10, 17, 295957) opinion so far expressed renders it wholly unnecessary for me to put these proposals before fellow delegates, in order to test their feelings on them.
('65', 172, 10, 18, 296108) I have not and never had any desire to carry them by a mere majority.
('65', 172, 10, 19, 296178) For their proper working a hearty assent of an overwhelming majority is required, by my test.
('65', 172, 10, 20, 296272) I cannot be satisfied with any majority, howsoever decisive, given as a price for my remaining in the Congress.
('65', 172, 10, 21, 296384) Such a position cannot flatter my pride or vanity.
('65', 172, 10, 22, 296435) It can only humiliate me.
('65', 172, 10, 23, 296461) I do not want to become a patron of

('65', 173, 0, 1, 296541) 174 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 173, 1, 2, 296583) the Congress.
('65', 173, 1, 3, 296597) I regard myself as a humble servant of the nation and a fellow worker for the sake of service.
('65', 173, 1, 4, 296692) My proposed retirement is neither a threat nor an ultimatum.
('65', 173, 1, 5, 296753) It is a natural consequence of the rejection of amendments, because hearty acceptance of the amendments is necessary to enable me to render efficient service.
('65', 173, 1, 6, 296912) It is now as clear as crystal that I cannot secure that hearty assent from the Congress.
('65', 173, 1, 7, 297001) Subject, therefore, to whatever the informal meeting of the members of the A. I. C. C. may have to say, I propose to retire from the Congress immediately after closing of the session.
('65', 173, 1, 8, 297185) In this step, I have the fullest concurrence of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Dr. Anrsari.
('65', 173, 1, 9, 297275) The latter tells me that he had made up his mind at Port Said where he saw my statement that my retirement was in every way in the best interests of the nation.
('65', 173, 1, 10, 297436) He had no doubt also as to the time for retirement.
('65', 173, 1, 11, 297488) It is wholly wrong to think, as some have done, that the recent visit of Sardar Patel and Babu Rajendra Prasad was for the purpose of pressing me to remain in the Congress.
('65', 173, 1, 12, 297661) They had never any doubt as to the correctness of my position.
('65', 173, 1, 13, 297724) I may also state that many of my most valued co workers, including the Khan Brothers, have heartily endorsed the contemplated retirement.
('65', 173, 1, 14, 297862) All these know that my retirement from the Congress does not mean the loss of my services.
('65', 173, 1, 15, 297953) On the contrary, my services are always at the country’s beck and call and may be commanded without any Congressman feeling any the least embarrassment because of my retirement from the Congress.
('65', 173, 1, 16, 298149) I feel that the presence in the Congress of a man like me, having fundamental differences on many of the most important questions, with many colleagues, must be a source of weakness rather than strength.
('65', 173, 1, 17, 298353) Hence the decision.
('65', 173, 1, 18, 298373) Lest my contemplated retirement should be exploited in order to damage the Parliamentary fight in which the Congress is now engaged, I would like all Congressmen to know that I am firmer than ever in my conviction that notwithstanding whatever I have said before to the contrary, I hold the representation of the Congress on the legislatures to be necessary.
('65', 173, 1, 19, 298732) Boycott of legislatures was never meant to be a permanent step.
('65', 173, 1, 20, 298796) Those who have no convictions to the contrary and are otherwise free should hold themselves at the disposal of the Congress to serve the nation through entering the legislatures.
('65', 173, 1, 21, 298975) The present election campaign is a fight not among men but among political principles represented by men or women professing to
('65', 174, 0, 1, 299103) VOL.65: 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 175
('65', 174, 1, 2, 299152) represent them.
('65', 174, 1, 3, 299168) It is the paramount duty of voters who believe that the Congress stands in the amplest manner for the nation’s goal of inde pendence and that it has counted and will count no sacrifice too great to achieve that goal, to give their vote to the Congress candidates.
('65', 174, 1, 4, 299432) Having cleared the ground thus for my retirement, I would invite the attention of Congressmen to the amendments appended hereto giving effect to my proposal for reducing the number of delegates from 6,000 to 1,000. At the most, I hold it to be vital for the growth of the Congress.
('65', 174, 1, 5, 299714) Unwieldy and merely spectacular as the Congress had become in the years before 1920, it has tended more and more again to degenerate into the same spectacular body.
('65', 174, 1, 6, 299879) Entertainments and exhibitions, good as they are in their places, have overshadowed the business part of the annual session.
('65', 174, 1, 7, 300004) My amendments remedy the evil.
('65', 174, 1, 8, 300035) These amendments are to be regarded solely as my individual view.
('65', 174, 1, 9, 300101) In order that the change contemplated may not come without due warning to the nation, with the consent of Sardar Vallabhbhai I have taken the liberty of placing the amendments before the public.
('65', 174, 1, 10, 300296) There is no question of threat or ultimatum behind the amendments.
('65', 174, 1, 11, 300363) It will be open to the Subjects Committee and then to the Congress to reject the amendments, but I would warn them against so doing without the most careful conside ration.
('65', 174, 1, 12, 300536) Let Congressmen understand that I am the author of the constitution 1, as it is.
('65', 174, 1, 13, 300617) They will also bear in mind that I have had an exceptional opportunity of carefully studying its working.
('65', 174, 1, 14, 300723) Experience has revealed several flaws in the constitution.
('65', 174, 1, 15, 300782) My proposal is devised to remove them.
('65', 174, 1, 16, 300821) That experience may discover other flaws in my proposal is quite likely.
('65', 174, 1, 17, 300894) When they are discovered, the Congress will deal with them but so far as I can judge, my proposal meets with the present situation, and makes the whole Congress organization, if it is at all honestly worked, a most efficient body and more truly representative of Congressmen than it has ever been.
('65', 174, 1, 18, 301192) Briefly, it amounts to this.
('65', 174, 1, 19, 301221) The maximum of 1,000 delegates will now be distributed not according to the population of each province but in accordance with the number of Congressmen on the Congress register in each province and there will be one delegate to every 1,000 or more Congressmen.
('65', 174, 1, 20, 301483) Therefore, in order to have the full quota of 1,000 for all India, we shall need 1,000,000 Congressmen on our

('65', 175, 0, 1, 301728) 176 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 175, 1, 2, 301770) register.
('65', 175, 1, 3, 301780) In order to keep up to its level of population, every province will at least have to make an effort to keep its register of members up to the mark.
('65', 175, 1, 4, 301928) In order to check the tendency that has unfortunately grown up of buying members just for voting purposes at four annas each, the proposed change requires that no one shall be entitled to vote at any election before the expiry of six months after the date of his paying a subscription of four annas.
('65', 175, 1, 5, 302228) Then again, hitherto, we have had persons in any part of India elected as delegates in any other part of India.
('65', 175, 1, 6, 302340) The result has been a number of bogus delegates at all Congress sessions.
('65', 175, 1, 7, 302414) Some Provincial Congress Committees have been known to have offered almost a free run to anybody who has wanted to be elected as a delegate.
('65', 175, 1, 8, 302555) This is effectively dealt with under the amendments by restricting the election of delegates to only those who might be on the Congress register in the constituency for which they stand.
('65', 175, 1, 9, 302742) The actual number of delegates to be elected shall depend upon and vary with the total number of Congressmen of six months’ standing on the Congress register for the whole of India.
('65', 175, 1, 10, 302924) In order to ensure the election of delegates who are real representatives, choice is confined to Congressmen on the registers of the different constituencies whose number would vary from year to year with the number of Congressmen on the register.
('65', 175, 1, 11, 303172) Under this proposal, the expenses of election are reduced to a minimum.
('65', 175, 1, 12, 303244) The possibility for fraud, too, is reduced, where there is desire for tolerable honesty.
('65', 175, 1, 13, 303333) No constitution that human intelligence can devise will ever be foolproof or knave proof.
('65', 175, 1, 14, 303423) Another change of importance is that delegates themselves become the A. I. C. C. members for the year, thus obviating the necessity for election of an A. I. C. C. and delegates from their provinces become the Provincial Congress Committee members in their respective provinces.
('65', 175, 1, 15, 303701) Thus I have combined three elections in one and ensured continuity of work.
('65', 175, 1, 16, 303777) Then there is the amendment making Calcutta a separate province When I was in Calcutta, it was suggested to me that I should induce the Working Committee to propose the amendment.
('65', 175, 1, 17, 303957) If the idea commends itself to Congressmen, the same facility may be extended to some other cities.
('65', 175, 1, 18, 304057) The experiment has worked well in Bombay.
('65', 175, 1, 19, 304099) There is a proposal to replace the new A. I. C. C. by 1,000 members elected by the delegates who will attend the Congress.
('65', 175, 1, 20, 304222) If this suggestion is fantastic or too hastily conceived, it will have to be
('65', 176, 0, 1, 304299) VOL.65: 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 177
('65', 176, 1, 2, 304348) withdrawn.
('65', 176, 1, 3, 304359) But seeing that we might not have another session of the Congress before the beginning of 1936, I thought that it would be better if the change was inaugurated by a more representative A. I. C. C. delegates assembled will have to divide themselves into provincial blocks and each block will elect, for the present, its quota according to the existing proportion.
('65', 176, 1, 4, 304722) Congressmen will note, too, that in the amendment there is no provision for the taluk and district committees.
('65', 176, 1, 5, 304833) This is a deliberate omission.
('65', 176, 1, 6, 304864) The duty of creating some organization in taluks and districts devolves upon the Provincial Congress Committees, which will appoint committees or agencies or have committees elected in accordance with the spirit of the amendments, i.e., by dividing districts and taluks into constituencies or circles for the purpose of electing committees, which must necessarily be small.
('65', 176, 1, 7, 305238) At present, provincial organizations contain an unwieldy number.
('65', 176, 1, 8, 305303) The result has been much cry and little wool.
('65', 176, 1, 9, 305349) I may note two more important changes.
('65', 176, 1, 10, 305388) The Congress has always insisted, in resolutions, on the use of Hindi in the conduct of its business, but members have not, in any appreciable measure, responded to their own oft repeated resolutions.
('65', 176, 1, 11, 305589) I have sought, therefore, to introduce a slight education test by requiring every applicant for membership to sign his or her name in Devanagari or the Urdu script.
('65', 176, 1, 12, 305754) This much can be learned in one hour.
('65', 176, 1, 13, 305792) I remember having given no more time to my wife and a 60 year old client for teaching them to sign their names in English script.
('65', 176, 1, 14, 305922) Is it too much to expect an aspirant after Congress membership to give one hour for the sake of the nation?
('65', 176, 1, 15, 306030) The other change contemplated is to regularize the convention of giving the President power of appointing his own colleagues of the Working Committee, including Secretaries and Treasurer.
('65', 176, 1, 16, 306218) The idea is to save time and some degree of vexation.
('65', 176, 1, 17, 306272) Not to accept the recommendation of the President in such a matter would be a vote of no confidence.
('65', 176, 1, 18, 306373) No president can work if his colleagues are imposed upon him.
('65', 176, 1, 19, 306435) Now I come to two other resolutions.
('65', 176, 1, 20, 306472) One is to free the Reception Committee from the burden of elaborate arrangements for entertainments and exhibition.
('65', 176, 1, 21, 306588) These have been, according to the idiosyncrasies of the Reception Committees, entrusted more or less to the All India Spinners’ Association, as they should have been always
('65', 177, 0, 1, 306761) 178 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 177, 1, 2, 306803) entirely left to it.
('65', 177, 1, 3, 306824) I have held special views about exhibitions which I do not wish to reiterate here.
('65', 177, 1, 4, 306907) The resolution I have suggested regularizes the usually held convention.
('65', 177, 1, 5, 306980) The idea behind my suggestion is that the primary and only function of the Reception Committee should be to make the annual session of the Congress a thorough success from the practical business point of view.
('65', 177, 1, 6, 307190) The present mode makes it impossible for important village or district centres to invite the Congress.
('65', 177, 1, 7, 307293) The result has been that its educative influence has never travelled outside the principal cities.
('65', 177, 1, 8, 307392) There is no reason whatsoever why the Congress should not be able to meet even in a village.
('65', 177, 1, 9, 307485) If they have business ability, the village that invites the Congress will financially not only not lose but gain.
('65', 177, 1, 10, 307599) There are many important stations on the railway line throughout India, where the Congress can easily meet without the slightest inconvenience to its members.
('65', 177, 1, 11, 307758) All this can only happen when we develop the instinct for identifying ourselves with the masses and desire to know them and their wants and to appreciate the beauty of village life, when it is shorn of the squalor and poverty that make it what it is today in India.
('65', 177, 1, 12, 308024) That brings me to the last resolution.
('65', 177, 1, 13, 308063) That resolution seeks to bring into being an association that will look after village industries.
('65', 177, 1, 14, 308161) I have named the spirit behind it, cent per cent swadeshi.
('65', 177, 1, 15, 308220) What goes under the name swadeshi is no doubt good enough but that swadeshi is bound to make progress without any effort on the part of the Congress.
('65', 177, 1, 16, 308370) Special effort was, in the early stages, necessary when the deliberate fashion was to despise everything that was swadeshi, and when it was a mark of civilization, if not also of patriotism, to adopt foreign manners and customs and to use fashionable foreign articles.
('65', 177, 1, 17, 308639) I well remember my student days when we, the students, used to look with admiration at the fashionable dresses of our teachers which were made of foreign stuff and were looking forward to the day when we should be able to afford the necessary freedom to be dressed even as they were.
('65', 177, 1, 18, 308923) The Congress can certainly claim to have changed all this and evoked a spirit of swadeshi but it must not rest on its past achievements and move in a circle.
('65', 177, 1, 19, 309081) It has now to penetrate into the villages and not be satisfied with the ability of the cities to manufacture articles of use and luxury, in imitation of the foreign ones.
('65', 177, 1, 20, 309252) It has now to understand which village industry has died and why.
('65', 177, 1, 21, 309318) Whilst the Government has perhaps the largest share in pauperizing the villages, cities, that have developed out of ruin to villages, cannot escape their responsibility for the growing pauperism
('65', 178, 0, 1, 309513) VOL.65: 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 179
('65', 178, 1, 2, 309562) of the dumb millions and it is not yet too late to resuscitate villages by organizing their industries as far as possible.
('65', 178, 1, 3, 309685) By so doing, we can surely put many millions of rupees into the pockets of the villagers without much, if any, capital output.
('65', 178, 1, 4, 309812) Let me quote some startling figures.
('65', 178, 1, 5, 309849) The All India Spinners’ Association is serving over 5,000 villages and through them supporting 220,000 spinners and weavers and 20,000 carders.
('65', 178, 1, 6, 309993) During the ten years of its existence, over 2_ crores of rupees have been distributed amongst these villagers.
('65', 178, 1, 7, 310104) In other words, at least that much wealth was produced in the country through the efforts of the Association and the whole of it contributed to the prosperity of villagers, not by destroying any of their industries but by utilizing their idle hours.
('65', 178, 1, 8, 310354) Out of the two and a quarter crores of rupees, three quarters went into the pockets of spinners alone and 95 lakhs of rupees into the pockets of farmers, for cotton which the Association bought for the spinners.
('65', 178, 1, 9, 310566) On an average, these three classes of workers, spinners, weavers and carders, added Rs. 12 per year to their earnings.
('65', 178, 2, 10, 310685) In individual cases, it has been found as much as 43 per cent has been added to the earning of spinners.
('65', 178, 2, 11, 310790) This is not a fairy tale.
('65', 178, 2, 12, 310816) These are figures specially prepared at my instance and can be verified by any research scholar who cares to.
('65', 178, 2, 13, 310926) The figures I have given are an under estimate, but the A. I. S. A. touches the centre of village life.
('65', 178, 2, 14, 311030) I admit that its organization presents little attraction to those who are not saturated with the village spirit, but the organization which I have now in view presents varied scope for Indian talent.
('65', 178, 2, 15, 311230) Some of the perishing industries must be revived, if villagers are to live.
('65', 178, 2, 16, 311306) I am quite convinced that some of these village industries can be revived and are worth reviving.
('65', 178, 2, 17, 311404) With a little scientific research and a little organizing ability the proposed new association can do a vast amount of work, if, of course, it has the backing of the people, which will be the main capital it will start with.
('65', 178, 2, 18, 311629) If such an association is to succeed, it must be in the hands of those who have some knowledge of the work and abundant faith in their mission and have love for the villagers.
('65', 178, 2, 19, 311805) It must be autonomous like the A. I. S. A. A political, democratic organization like the Congress cannot meddle with the work of experts, without spoiling their work and damaging the prestige of the Congress.
('65', 178, 2, 20, 312014) I, therefore, strongly recommend the adoption of the
('65', 178, 3, 21, 312067) 1 The Bombay Chronicle, 16 l0 1934, here adds: “Roughly this means a 20 per cent addition to their annual earning.”
('65', 179, 0, 1, 312183) 180 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 179, 1, 2, 312225) resolution for creating an All India Village Industries Association.
('65', 179, 1, 3, 312294) The exhibition that I have referred to in my resolution regarding the Reception Committee contemplates the exhibition of the result of the activities of the All India Village Industries Association as now contemplated.
('65', 179, 1, 4, 312513) The two together will bring before the public the marvellous result that can be produced through the industries of villagers in their own homes.
('65', 179, 1, 5, 312658) It is my certain conviction that if the so called higher classes will but identify themselves with the so called lower classes and lend them the support of their intelligence and ability, India can become a land flowing with milk and honey and can also achieve her economic independence without deadly war, either with the Government or with the capitalists.
('65', 179, 1, 6, 313017) Political independence will follow as a matter of course, without the intervention of civil disobedience.
('65', 179, 1, 7, 313123) The vital amendments of the constitution and the two resolutions have all been conveyed in that spirit and no other.
('65', 179, 1, 8, 313240) For me, complete independence of India is an impossible dream without the higher classes merging themselves in those millions who are miscalled the lower classes.
('65', 179, 1, 9, 313403) And I would like to examine all the three resolutions in that spirit and no other.
('65', 179, 2, 10, 313486) APPENDIX

('65', 180, 1, 14, 316695) 11. Thereupon each province shall be divided into as many constituencies as would give five delegates to each constituency.

('65', 183, 1, 3, 321539) D. S. SARDESAI October 15, 1934
('65', 183, 2, 4, 321571) DEAR DR.
('65', 183, 2, 5, 321580) SARDESAI, I thank you for your letter.
('65', 183, 2, 6, 321619) I have had a talk with Jamnalalji, and he tells me that the Ruiya Charities Trust is not yet in operation.
('65', 183, 2, 7, 321726) But when it is, Jamnalalji says that he would undoubtedly bear your hospital in mind.
('65', 183, 2, 8, 321812) But he wants me to warn you against building any hope on it just now.
('65', 183, 2, 9, 321882) Little Sumitra 1 is living on milk, fruit and some non starchy vegetables such as marrow, green leaves and the like.
('65', 183, 2, 10, 321999) Will you please tell me if it is necessary for her to add anything to this diet?
('65', 183, 2, 11, 322080) I ask this question because her grandmother wrote to say that you had advised that she should take ordinary food.
('65', 183, 2, 12, 322194) She was taking that food before, but she has always been constipated.
('65', 183, 2, 13, 322264) What is more, she has had fever off and on.
('65', 183, 2, 14, 322308) I then put her on the diet she is now having and it seems to have suited her well.
('65', 183, 2, 15, 322391) There was an interruption only for one day.
('65', 183, 2, 16, 322435) She had a little chapati, and the next day she developed high fever.
('65', 183, 2, 17, 322504) I stopped the chapati and the fever stopped and has not returned since.
('65', 183, 2, 18, 322576) If you do not hold it absolutely necessary for her to have bread, rice and dal, I would far rather not take the risk and let her go on with as much milk and fruit as she can take.
('65', 183, 2, 19, 322756) Once more thanking you for the attention you are giving her,
('65', 183, 3, 20, 322817) Yours sincerely,

('65', 186, 11, 20, 326091) October 17, 1934
('65', 186, 12, 21, 326108) HARILAL,
('65', 186, 13, 22, 326117) You are constantly in my thoughts.
('65', 186, 13, 23, 326152) If I had time, I would go on inflicting long letters on you.
('65', 186, 13, 24, 326213) If the change that you have described endures, a painful episode in my life would end and I would be extremely happy in this the last stage of my life.
('65', 186, 13, 25, 326365) I do not wish that you should do anything beyond your strength.
('65', 186, 13, 26, 326429) Only as much as your reason and heart accept will endure and seem natural.
('65', 186, 13, 27, 326504) I am sure that if you followed rules of diet, etc., you would be completely all right.
('65', 186, 13, 28, 326591) Do not regard yourself as an old man.
('65', 186, 13, 29, 326629) I would not be pained if you could do nothing, but I would certainly be pained if you were to break your word to me or do
('65', 187, 0, 1, 326751) 188 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 187, 1, 2, 326793) anything which might amount to breach of trust with anybody.
('65', 187, 1, 3, 326854) At the moment, it is I who trust you most.
('65', 187, 1, 4, 326897) Others, that is Ba, Ramdas, Devdas, Kanti, etc., are less hopeful for they have memories of bitter experiences.
('65', 187, 1, 5, 327009) I have them, too, but I had never given up hope about you, and always believed that one day you would be reformed.
('65', 187, 1, 6, 327124) I believe that that day has come now.
('65', 187, 1, 7, 327162) May God help you.
('65', 187, 1, 8, 327180) Write to me and give me exact details of your debts and the names of the parties to whom you owe them.
('65', 187, 1, 9, 327283) I wish to help you as much.
('65', 187, 1, 10, 327311) as I can consistently with my dharma.
('65', 187, 1, 11, 327349) Do you have to pay interest on the loans?
('65', 187, 1, 12, 327391) I see that you have not been able to give up smoking.
('65', 187, 1, 13, 327445) So long as you find it absolutely necessary to smoke, you may do so as if you were taking medicine.
('65', 187, 1, 14, 327545) Perhaps you do not know that it is not in the least difficult to give up smoking.
('65', 187, 1, 15, 327627) It can be done by adopting a simple diet.
('65', 187, 1, 16, 327669) What do you eat?
('65', 187, 1, 17, 327686) Are you ready to make changes in your diet?
('65', 187, 1, 18, 327730) I had a long letter from Maneklal.
('65', 187, 1, 19, 327765) He says that you are afraid of temptations in Rajkot.
('65', 187, 1, 20, 327819) If there is the slightest truth in that, let me know.
('65', 187, 1, 21, 327873) Have no hesitation at all in telling me the exact truth.
('65', 187, 1, 22, 327930) Write to me frankly and open out your heart as you would do to a very intimate friend.
('65', 187, 1, 23, 328017) You made many friends in the past.
('65', 187, 1, 24, 328052) Forget now the harm that those friendships did you.
('65', 187, 1, 25, 328104) Now regard me as your only friend.
('65', 187, 1, 26, 328139) That will certainly do you no harm.
('65', 187, 1, 27, 328175) And, moreover, there is a Supreme Friend between you and me, who dwells in our hearts and, therefore, knows our thoughts.
('65', 187, 1, 28, 328297) I very much wish to send for you here and keep you with me.
('65', 187, 1, 29, 328357) But my condition is quite peculiar just now.
('65', 187, 1, 30, 328402) I don’t enjoy a moment’s leisure.
('65', 187, 1, 31, 328436) I rise up at 2.30 every morning.
('65', 187, 1, 32, 328469) Today I rose at 1.45. It is nearing 3.30 now.
('65', 187, 1, 33, 328515) If I called you, I would feel tempted to talk with you, which, however, I cannot afford to do.
('65', 187, 1, 34, 328610) I can’t stop thinking about you all the times, though.
('65', 187, 1, 35, 328665) Maybe, father’s love doesn’t fall away from even a devotee of Mother Gita, or perhaps the Gita teaches that I should be thus concerned with you.
('65', 187, 1, 36, 328810) Be that as it may.
('65', 187, 1, 37, 328829) If you have no fear just now of being overcome by temptations, remain there for the time being and learn spinning on the takli, etc., thoroughly.
('65', 187, 1, 38, 328975) If you are not keeping a diary, start doing so.
('65', 187, 1, 39, 329023) A letter for Manu is enclosed.
('65', 187, 1, 40, 329054) Ramdas is fairly well.
('65', 187, 1, 41, 329077) He is still in hospital, though.
('65', 187, 1, 42, 329110) There is no fever, but he has not regained strength.

('65', 188, 8, 20, 330154) I am picking it up.
('65', 188, 8, 21, 330174) I can now spin 40 rounds in half an hour.
('65', 188, 8, 22, 330216) I hope to be able to spin more.
('65', 188, 8, 23, 330248) If you know this new method, teach the same to Bhai.

('65', 189, 8, 16, 331102) Jamnalalji has no part at all in this matter.
('65', 189, 8, 17, 331148) I too am totally ignorant.
('65', 189, 8, 18, 331175) I have never taken interest in such controversies.
('65', 189, 8, 19, 331226) Sardar is not partial to anyone.
('65', 189, 8, 20, 331259) He fights with me too.
('65', 189, 8, 21, 331282) But we are agreed on one thing, that is, to do only what we hold as truth.

('65', 189, 8, 23, 331424) He who craves for office can never serve.
('65', 189, 8, 24, 331466) I had thought you were now free of the fascination for office.
('65', 189, 8, 25, 331529) Now tell me, what I can do?
('65', 189, 8, 26, 331557) You must have seen my statement.
('65', 189, 8, 27, 331590) Please understand that after a short while I shall have nothing to do with these things.
('65', 189, 8, 28, 331679) And later no one may even consult me on such controversial matters, but my services will certainly be available if needed.

('65', 190, 10, 17, 332859) You have read to me a paragraph in the Maharashtra of the 17th instant whose purport is that although he was unwilling to sign invitation to the Prime Minister to decide upon the communal question that was before the Round Table Conference, Dr. Moonje, on receiving a message from me that it was advisable for him to sign the invitation, did so.
('65', 190, 10, 18, 333205) You ask me to give my opinion upon the statement attributed by the Maharashtra to Dr. Moonje.
('65', 190, 10, 19, 333299) I am very sorry to have to tell you that my memory can give me no help in this matter.
('65', 190, 10, 20, 333386) I have no recollection of having sent any such message to Dr. Moonje but if Dr. Moonje would kindly coax my memory, give me, if he remembers them, the details surrounding the sending of the message and the

('65', 192, 13, 22, 335907) A correspondent asks:
('65', 192, 14, 23, 335929) Why do you insist on sacrificial spinning or self spinning?
('65', 192, 14, 24, 335989) Sacrificial spinning is spinning to give away.
('65', 192, 14, 25, 336036) Self spinning is to convert your own yarn into khadi for personal use.
('65', 192, 14, 26, 336107) In either case, you take away something from the
('65', 193, 0, 1, 336156) 194 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 193, 1, 2, 336198) mouth of the poor spinner, whom you call the lowliest paid worker.
('65', 193, 1, 3, 336265) In sacrificial spinning, you do serve the poor a little by assisting to lower the price of khadi.
('65', 193, 1, 4, 336363) In the other, it is sheer snatching the bread from a poor spinner’s mouth.
('65', 193, 1, 5, 336438) This would be partly or wholly true, if spinning had become universal.
('65', 193, 1, 6, 336509) But today there are some Harijans whose wage earning capacity has been reduced by 50 per cent because they, being weavers, have no hand spun yarn to weave from.
('65', 193, 1, 7, 336670) They are now trying to eke out a precarious living anyhow.
('65', 193, 1, 8, 336729) These would not be reduced to this sad condition, if there was sacrificial spinning going on in the country on any large scale.
('65', 193, 1, 9, 336857) I have already stated 1 in these columns how in Orissa representatives of nearly ten thousand weavers, who are almost (because unclassified) Harijans, were starving for want of work, which is the same thing as saying want of hand spun yarn.
('65', 193, 1, 10, 337098) It is useless to say that they can weave mill spun yarn.
('65', 193, 1, 11, 337155) These ten thousand weavers were doing it.
('65', 193, 1, 12, 337197) But, owing to Japanese competition, the demand for hand woven mill spun cloth has considerably decreased.
('65', 193, 1, 13, 337303) It is possible for khadi weavers to find a local market for their khadi, not for hand woven cloth of mill spun yarn.
('65', 193, 1, 14, 337420) Time was when there was an abundance of hand spun yarn because there were hunderds, if not thousands, of sacrificial spinners, and there was a dearth of weavers.
('65', 193, 1, 15, 337582) Now sacrificial spinning has gone out of vogue, and there is practically a plethora of weavers who would gladly weave hand spun yarn.
('65', 193, 1, 16, 337716) Therefore, for a long time to come and so long as there is demand for khadi on the market and until spinning has become so general as to supply the demand, both sacrificial and self spinning have a definite place in national economy.
('65', 193, 1, 17, 337950) It means definite, tangible service of the poor and, among them, specially Harijans.
('65', 193, 1, 18, 338035) Moreover, such spinning, seeing that it has to be done by intelligent, educated men and women, becomes allied to art and thus admits of great development.
('65', 193, 1, 19, 338190) The marvellous improvements that have taken place in the wheel and its accessories, the handgin and the carding bow, are all due to the interest that the educated middle class men and women have taken in the movement.
('65', 193, 1, 20, 338408) All the readers of Harijan do not know that the Secretary 2 of the A. I. S. A. is an M. A. and the son of a distinguished and successful banker of Bombay, that

P. an ex Principal 5 of a national college.
('65', 194, 1, 3, 338975) These are but a few names, out of many such I can give, who have dedicated themselves to the service of Daridranarayana, through khadi.
('65', 194, 1, 4, 339111) But for this band of devotees, the substantial progress that it has made would have been impossible, and the half crore rupees that have been distributed among, say, two hundred and fifty thousand workers, not as doles but wages for honest labour, during the years that the spinning movement has been going on, would not have been distributed.
('65', 194, 1, 5, 339455) In no other or better manner could such quick work have been done than through the wheel.
('65', 194, 1, 6, 339545) It has brought the lowliest in living touch with some of the most cultured men and women in the country, it has brought a ray of light into dark hovels, it has put heart into sinking bodies, it has provided milk for thousands of milkless children, enabled villagers who would care to have automatic famine insurance, reduced idleness and reclaimed thousands from a beggar’s life.
('65', 194, 1, 7, 339925) And yet the work is only in its beginning stages.
('65', 194, 1, 8, 339975) The workers are too few.
('65', 194, 1, 9, 340000) Those that are need more consecration and greater concentration.
('65', 194, 1, 10, 340065) Many more hundreds can be absorbed by this national and humanitarian effort.
('65', 194, 1, 11, 340142) Therefore, it is wrong to say that sacrificial spinning or selfspinning is harmful to the wage spinners.
('65', 194, 1, 12, 340247) It is the peremptory duty of all who can to devote at least half an hour daily to spin for the sake of Harijans—the outcastes of India.

('65', 194, 4, 15, 340414) A SEVAK’S DIFFICULTY
('65', 194, 5, 16, 340435) A Lyallpur correspondent asks the following pertinent questions:
('65', 194, 6, 17, 340500) 1 G. D. Birla 2 C. Rajagopalachari 3 Dr. B. C. Roy 4 Satis Chandra Das Gupta 5 Acharya Jugal Kishore
('65', 195, 0, 1, 340601) 196 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 195, 1, 2, 340643) (1) In many chawls where the Harijans are settled, there is a Muslim or a Sikh population.
('65', 195, 1, 3, 340734) There are practically no Hindus, or if there be two or three Hindu shopkeepers, they are exclusively under the thumb and control of those zamindars, whose orders they cannot disobey or whose displeasure they cannot incur.
('65', 195, 1, 4, 340956) Thus, those Hindus are incapable of rendering any help to the Harijans in supplying water to them.
('65', 195, 1, 5, 341055) How to solve this difficulty?
('65', 195, 2, 6, 341085) (2) There is an anti propaganda of ‘Adi Dharmis’, who wean them away from the Hindu society.
('65', 195, 2, 7, 341178) How to meet or counteract that propaganda?
('65', 195, 3, 8, 341221) (3) There is an untouchability within several sects of untouchables.
('65', 195, 4, 9, 341290) As to the first question, the first obvious step is to plead with the Muslims and Sikhs to permit the Harijans to use the common well.
('65', 195, 4, 10, 341425) The second is, side by side with the method of persuasion or after its failure, for the caste Hindus themselves to supply the necessary quantity of water to Harijans.
('65', 195, 4, 11, 341592) Of course, there is the recourse to the law courts.
('65', 195, 4, 12, 341644) Harijans are by law entitled to use common wells, roads, etc., in the same manner as the rest of the public.
('65', 195, 4, 13, 341753) But this remedy has to be used most sparingly.
('65', 195, 4, 14, 341800) For the second question, nothing but progressive repentance and consequent change on the part of caste Hindus can prevent the growing estrangement between them and the Harijans.
('65', 195, 4, 15, 341978) AdiDharmis are themselves Hindus.
('65', 195, 4, 16, 342012) Their separation is a revolt against caste Hindus for the latter’s oppression.
('65', 195, 4, 17, 342091) They will return to the fold when they see that untouchability has been entirely removed.
('65', 195, 4, 18, 342181) As for the third question, the removal of untouchability as between the various sects of untouchables will progress almost, if not entirely, in the same ratio as the removal of untouchability on the part of caste Hindus.
('65', 195, 4, 19, 342402) For, the observance of untouchability among untouchables is a direct result of its observance by caste Hindus.
('65', 195, 5, 20, 342513) “DARIDRANARAYANA” AND HARIJAN
('65', 195, 6, 21, 342543) There is a struggle going on between Daridranarayana and Harijan: Which includes the other?
('65', 195, 6, 22, 342635) Thoughtlessly the answer would be, ‘of course, Harijan’.
('65', 195, 6, 23, 342692) But a moment’s reflection shows that Daridranarayana is the larger form.
('65', 195, 6, 24, 342765) Harijans are undoubtedly Daridranarayana but they are ranked the lowest by the well to do.
('65', 196, 0, 1, 342856) VOL.65: 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 197
('65', 196, 1, 2, 342905) Hence they are the nearest and dearest to Hara or Hari—God.
('65', 196, 1, 3, 342965) For, has He not called Himself Servant of His servants?
('65', 196, 1, 4, 343021) And whom will He serve most, if not those who are the most neglected by the world?
('65', 196, 1, 5, 343104) Daridranarayana however includes, besides Harijans, all those many millions who are not branded outcastes from their birth.
('65', 196, 1, 6, 343228) Therefore, service of Harijans necessarily includes that of Daridranarayana, but that of Daridranarayana may not always be also service of Harijans.
('65', 196, 1, 7, 343377) Writers for Harijan will, therefore, do well always to bear this distinction in mind.
('65', 196, 1, 8, 343463) For they should remember that the Harijan is a weekly wholly devoted to the Harijan cause and, therefore, excludes everything that has no bearing on that cause either directly or indirectly.
('65', 196, 1, 9, 343654) It is necessary to bear this distinction in mind, since I am devoting its columns freely to many matters which I have appeared to have hitherto excluded from them.
('65', 196, 1, 10, 343818) The fact is that during the hurricane tour I had little leisure to think, as I am now doing, of many efforts at construction, much less to write about them.
('65', 196, 1, 11, 343975) For their allround amelioration, there is limitless scope.
('65', 196, 1, 12, 344034) Do they not represent numerically a large part of humanity and, in point of usefulness, rank perhaps the highest in society?
('65', 196, 1, 13, 344159) Indian humanity would soon disintegrate, if they suddenly ceased to do the work they are doing at present with the brand of the outcaste on their foreheads for reward.
('65', 196, 2, 14, 344327) THE REFORMER’S PRAYER
('65', 196, 3, 15, 344349) A correspondent sends the following apposite prayer from Tagore’s Gitanjali:
('65', 196, 4, 16, 344426) Here is Thy footstool and there rest Thy feet, where live the poorest and lowliest and lost.
('65', 196, 4, 17, 344519) When I try to bow to Thee, my obeisance cannot reach down to the depth where Thy feet rest among the poorest and lowliest and lost.
('65', 196, 4, 18, 344651) Pride can never approach to where Thou walkest in the clothes of the humble among the poorest and lowliest and lost.
('65', 196, 4, 19, 344768) My heart can never find its way to where Thou keepest company with the companionless among the poorest, the lowliest and the lost.

('65', 197, 2, 4, 345077) The information that Kumarsaheb had completely recovered was welcome news.
('65', 197, 2, 5, 345152) On reading that you had fallen ill as a result of your labour for his recovery, I remembered the story of Babar.
('65', 197, 2, 6, 345265) Didn’t Babar die while saving Humayun?
('65', 197, 2, 7, 345304) You also have taken up the role of a Prince’s father and are draining away your health.
('65', 197, 2, 8, 345392) Your caution regarding me is justified.
('65', 197, 2, 9, 345432) But you and I are helpless in the matter.
('65', 197, 2, 10, 345474) I will go where Rama leads.
('65', 197, 2, 11, 345502) He has not yet spoken clearly.
('65', 197, 2, 12, 345533) Everything will be clear in Bombay.
('65', 197, 2, 13, 345569) I don’t even think about what will happen.
('65', 197, 3, 14, 345612) Vain is it to lament
('65', 197, 4, 15, 345633) What pleases the Master of the world at the moment,
('65', 197, 5, 16, 345685) Nothing happens as we wish,
('65', 197, 6, 17, 345713) Thus shall we save ourselves from worrying over things.
('65', 197, 6, 18, 345769) These lines of Narasinh Mehta I have been chanting to myself since 1893. I have also tried to the best of my ability to live according to them, looking upon them as holy words of the Vedas.
('65', 197, 6, 19, 345959) Such utterances are included in my definition of the Vedas.
('65', 197, 6, 20, 346019) My God who inspires the Vedas speaks through all languages.
('65', 197, 6, 21, 346079) I hope Ramabehn 1 will remain kind to me.
('65', 197, 6, 22, 346121) I do trust women like her will carry on the burden when the Congress drops spinning from its programme.
('65', 197, 6, 23, 346225) I know, however, I cannot ask you also to do that.

('65', 197, 11, 30, 346482) I will take care to write to you even from Bombay.
('65', 197, 11, 31, 346533) You may take codliver oil and eat eggs if you find it necessary to do so.

('65', 198, 1, 2, 346700) choice to you, between the two, eggs are preferable.
('65', 198, 1, 3, 346753) Crores of rupees are spent in the preparation of codliver oil, and I do not know how much cruelty is involved in catching the fish.
('65', 198, 1, 4, 346885) It seems to me to be a Satanic type of medicine.
('65', 198, 1, 5, 346934) Eggs matured according to modern methods seem to be quite innocuous.
('65', 198, 1, 6, 347003) We can see this for ourselves by making experiments, whereas we cannot prepare cod liver oil ourselves.
('65', 198, 1, 7, 347107) All the same, you know that I encouraged Prabhudas to take cod liver oil, as also Radha and others.
('65', 198, 1, 8, 347207) None of us can overcome the desire to live.
('65', 198, 1, 9, 347251) There is neither sin nor shame in this desire.
('65', 198, 1, 10, 347298) Cod liver oil also is one of the means of keeping oneself alive.
('65', 198, 1, 11, 347363) Even men who are reputed to be spiritually enlightened use it.
('65', 198, 1, 12, 347426) Who am I, then, to stop you from taking it?
('65', 198, 1, 13, 347470) This is a matter in which nobody should interfere in another’s case.
('65', 198, 1, 14, 347539) Ultimately, everyone should be his own judge as to what his dharma is.
('65', 198, 1, 15, 347610) You practise self examination and are eager to acquire knowledge from others.
('65', 198, 1, 16, 347688) I have, therefore, tried to tell you about both things as much as I know.
('65', 198, 1, 17, 347762) You may now take either of them if and when it may be necessary to do so.
('65', 198, 1, 18, 347836) Stay in the hospital as long as the doctor wants you to do so.
('65', 198, 1, 19, 347899) All that experience will be useful to you.
('65', 198, 1, 20, 347942) And now about Nimu.
('65', 198, 1, 21, 347962) I don’t write much, or anything, to you regarding her, thinking that she writes to you about everything.
('65', 198, 1, 22, 348067) I have been giving her fairly detailed guidance in regard to food and have made arrangements for teaching her English.
('65', 198, 1, 23, 348186) Other subjects she is already learning.
('65', 198, 1, 24, 348226) I send her milk and fruit in sufficient quantity.
('65', 198, 1, 25, 348276) Prabhavati and Sharma look after her and she remains quite cheerful.
('65', 198, 1, 26, 348345) During my absence, these two will look after everything.
('65', 198, 1, 27, 348402) If you have any suggestion to make, write to me.
('65', 198, 1, 28, 348451) Do you think that I should go there after the Congress session is over, that is, towards the end of this month?
('65', 198, 1, 29, 348563) Does Ba want it?
('65', 198, 1, 30, 348580) When you are able to walk about, I should like you to go to Wadhwan and other places.
('65', 198, 1, 31, 348666) Maneklal will feel very happy if you go to the new place where he has been transferred.
('65', 198, 1, 32, 348754) He is very keen that you should go.
('65', 198, 1, 33, 348790) He praises the air of the place very much.
('65', 198, 1, 34, 348833) But you will not get fruits there.
('65', 198, 1, 35, 348868) There is Chorwad too.
('65', 198, 1, 36, 348890) Stop thinking altogether.
('65', 198, 1, 37, 348916) If you make your mind light, there will be no danger at all to your life.
('65', 198, 1, 38, 348990) If you thus go out to these places, Ba may come and stay with me at Wardha for some time.
('65', 198, 1, 39, 349080) In that case I need not go to Ahmedabad at all.
('65', 198, 1, 40, 349128) Wherever I go, I am bound to have some public business to attend to.
('65', 198, 1, 41, 349197) I, therefore, wish to avoid going there.
('65', 198, 1, 42, 349238) But if you think I must go there I will.
('65', 198, 1, 43, 349279) Let me know frankly what you wish.

('65', 199, 1, 2, 349356) I understand your earnest desire that I should call Ba to Bombay.
('65', 199, 1, 3, 349422) But I think it will be more proper if she remains there.
('65', 199, 1, 4, 349479) It will be proper for her to leave only when you can fully look after yourself.
('65', 199, 1, 5, 349559) I am not taking with me any girl this time.
('65', 199, 1, 6, 349603) From among the men, too, I will take as few as possible.
('65', 199, 1, 7, 349660) I shall be accompanied by Kishorelalbhai and Gomatibehn.
('65', 199, 1, 8, 349717) Kakasaheb and Professor Akshayachandra also will be coming.
('65', 199, 1, 9, 349777) I don’t remember other names at the moment.
('65', 199, 1, 10, 349821) Let us see what happens in Bombay.
('65', 199, 1, 11, 349856) What you say about the danger of my remaining in the Congress being exploited is perfectly correct.
('65', 199, 1, 12, 349956) It is for such reasons that I am trying to leave it.
('65', 199, 1, 13, 350009) However, it is not easy to leave such a great institution without doing it harm.
('65', 199, 1, 14, 350090) There are many pure men, too, in it.
('65', 199, 1, 15, 350127) Jamnalalji will remain here.
('65', 199, 1, 16, 350156) I am not taking even him to the Congress session.

('65', 199, 6, 23, 350376) SUJNA BHAI,
('65', 199, 7, 24, 350388) I got both your letters.
('65', 199, 7, 25, 350413) I understand your inability to be one of the Trustees of the Harijan Ashram.
('65', 199, 7, 26, 350490) I don’t wish to press you too hard.
('65', 199, 7, 27, 350526) But may I assume that, in regard to the Harijan work itself, you will meet the needs of the work in Gujarat from time to time?
('65', 199, 7, 28, 350653) I accept your decision regarding the dairy.
('65', 199, 7, 29, 350697) The loss during the last year was very heavy indeed.
('65', 199, 7, 30, 350750) I am looking into the matter.
('65', 199, 7, 31, 350780) I shall be satisfied if you meet the loss up to December.
('65', 199, 7, 32, 350838) I should, however, like to see you adhere to your original assurance.
('65', 199, 7, 33, 350908) I will not readily let the burden of even Rs. 4,000 fall on you.
('65', 199, 7, 34, 350973) If the loss was due to no negligence on our part, I will not hesitate to stretch my hand before you.
('65', 199, 7, 35, 351074) I don’t wish to run the dairy at a loss even for one year.
('65', 199, 7, 36, 351133) Narandas is going through all the accounts.
('65', 199, 7, 37, 351177) In the budget for next year prepared three or four months ago, the aim is indeed to balance the two sides.
('65', 199, 7, 38, 351284) Meanwhile I learnt about the loss of Rs. 4,000. Narandas will now go to Sabarmati and guide me.
('65', 199, 7, 39, 351380) My intention in writing all this is to assure you that, having secured your support in this scheme

('65', 200, 1, 2, 351528) 1, I have not become indifferent to the losses.
('65', 200, 1, 3, 351576) It would be against my nature to go on burdening you with losses, however big they may be.
('65', 200, 1, 4, 351667) In all public activities under my charge throughout my life, I have always tried to balance the two sides.
('65', 200, 1, 5, 351774) I do not hesitate to incur a loss when I think it necessary to do so, but then I do it knowingly.
('65', 200, 1, 6, 351872) When conducting research in tanning, or when hoping for profit from Ramachandran lift 2, I did foresee the possibility of loss and had put an outer limit to it.
('65', 200, 1, 7, 352033) I had involved the late Revashankarbhai in the business of the Ramachandran lift and he had to make good Rs. 5,000. The scheme was then withdrawn.
('65', 200, 1, 8, 352180) In tanning, we may still have to continue to put up with losses.
('65', 200, 1, 9, 352245) It is an industry in which it is absolutely necessary that we should take interest.
('65', 200, 1, 10, 352329) Part of the loss in it will be met by Ghanshyamdas.
('65', 200, 1, 11, 352381) Into this modest venture in the service of the cow, I have drawn you.
('65', 200, 1, 12, 352451) It will mean loss of my reputation if you now withdraw.
('65', 200, 1, 13, 352507) I have inflicted this long explanation, which I have done after first accepting your decision, because I do not wish to lose my reputation with you.
('65', 200, 1, 14, 352656) You know very well that I have the utmost admiration for your frankness.
('65', 200, 1, 15, 352729) I don’t mind your decision at all.
('65', 200, 1, 16, 352764) All my business ventures rest wholly on my reputation.
('65', 200, 1, 17, 352819) The paper of bank notes, worthless in itself, is backed by some gold at least.
('65', 200, 1, 18, 352898) The paper of my notes is backed by nothing but Ramanama.
('65', 200, 1, 19, 352955) With whom, therefore, may I plead if not with a man like you?

('65', 201, 8, 14, 353888) The train taking me to Bombay is jolting.
('65', 201, 8, 15, 353930) You will put yourself in communication with Khan Saheb’s daughter and bring her with you if she is at all willing to come.

('65', 202, 2, 3, 354875) October 20, 1934 Congress should not on any account vote for non Congress candidates, much less against Bapuji Aney in spite of his unfortunate anti Congress attitude on the Communal Award.
('65', 202, 2, 4, 355065) I call it anti Congress in the sense that it is against the declared policy of the Congress on the question.
('65', 202, 2, 5, 355174) I therefore suggest that Congressmen should unreservedly vote for Bapuji Aney as opposed to the non Congress candidates.
('65', 202, 2, 6, 355295) But Congressmen ought to make it clear that they do not in any way by their vote identify themselves with Sjt.

('65', 202, 6, 12, 355586) There is no point in your going where Perinbehn has been insulted.
('65', 202, 6, 13, 355653) This is one of the main reasons.
('65', 202, 6, 14, 355686) Another is that it is proper for you to be there as long as Ramdas is [in the hospital].
('65', 202, 6, 15, 355775) The third reason is that my heart is no more with the Congress.
('65', 202, 6, 16, 355839) I have stopped Jamnalalji too.

('65', 202, 10, 22, 356063) [Before October 21, 1934]
('65', 202, 11, 23, 356089) Even though khadi is the most powerful means for attaining freedom, our khadi organizations are carrying on the work only as an economic activity.
('65', 202, 11, 24, 356236) An element of democracy can be introduced in
('65', 202, 12, 25, 356281) 1 This is a summary of a discussion with some khadi workers about the need to reorganize khadi work.
('65', 203, 0, 1, 356382) 204 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 203, 1, 2, 356424) these organizations only to a certain extent.
('65', 203, 1, 3, 356470) Conflict and even competition can have a place in democracy.
('65', 203, 1, 4, 356531) But these cannot be permitted in an economic organization.
('65', 203, 1, 5, 356590) Can we think of different or opposing groups in a commercial firm?
('65', 203, 1, 6, 356657) The whole administration of the firm would be thrown out of gear if such a thing happens.
('65', 203, 1, 7, 356747) Moreover, the khadi organizations are not merely economic organizations; they are benevolent institutions too.
('65', 203, 1, 8, 356858) Their aim is not to serve anybody’s selfish interests but to promote public welfare.
('65', 203, 1, 9, 356943) In democracy it is a rule to carry on work by humouring public opinion.
('65', 203, 1, 10, 357015) The aim of our khadi organizations is to attain not merely preya 1
('65', 203, 2, 11, 357082) but sreya 2 for the people.
('65', 203, 2, 12, 357110) Hence, at times they may have to carry on their work independently of the ever shifting public opinion.
('65', 203, 2, 13, 357214) They cannot be allowed to become the means of nurturing individual ambitions.
('65', 203, 2, 14, 357292) While thinking about the reorganization of khadi production you should not forget that in certain matters the economics of khadi and the commonly prevalent economics are poles asunder.
('65', 203, 2, 15, 357477) I am always reminded of one thing which the well known British economist Adam Smith has said in his famous treatise The Wealth of Nations.
('65', 203, 2, 16, 357616) In it he has described some economic laws as universal and absolute.
('65', 203, 2, 17, 357685) Then he has described certain situations which may be an obstacle to the operation of these laws.
('65', 203, 2, 18, 357783) These disturbing factors are the human nature, the human temperament or altruism inherent in it.
('65', 203, 2, 19, 357880) Now, the economics of khadi is just the opposite of it.
('65', 203, 2, 20, 357936) Benevolence which is inherent in human nature is the very foundation of the economics of khadi.
('65', 203, 2, 21, 358032) What Adam Smith has described as pure economic activity based merely on the calculations of profit and loss is a selfish attitude and it is an obstacle to the development of khadi; and it is the function of a champion of khadi to counteract this tendency.
('65', 203, 2, 22, 358288) Hence, the;tactics normally adopted in a profiteering business have no place in khadi activity.
('65', 203, 2, 23, 358384) For instance, cheating, fraud, falsehood, adulteration, exploiting people’s addictions or their baser feelings things practised in mill industries and ordinary trade—are to be completely shunned in khadi activity.
('65', 203, 2, 24, 358598) The policy of paying minimum wages to the weaver or spinner with a view to increasing profits can have no place in khadi activity.
('65', 203, 2, 25, 358729) At the same time, khadi activity cannot be carried on by incurring losses as a result of unpractical attitudes.
('65', 203, 2, 26, 358841) The reason why our khadi organizations incur losses today is the inefficiency of our
('65', 203, 3, 27, 358926) 1 Material welfare 2 Spiritual welfare
('65', 204, 0, 1, 358965) VOL.65: 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 205
('65', 204, 1, 2, 359014) workers.
('65', 204, 1, 3, 359023) In khadi activity spinners and other workers get full reward of their labour but the middlemen and organizers get nothing more than their due share.
('65', 204, 1, 4, 359172) Now take the case of standardization, i.e., producing khadi with a uniform policy.
('65', 204, 1, 5, 359255) Such uniformity cannot be expected in khadi.
('65', 204, 1, 6, 359300) Rajagopalchari had once remarked that a poor woman cannot be expected to spin yarn of uniform quality as in a mill.
('65', 204, 1, 7, 359416) She is not a lifeless machine, but a human being.
('65', 204, 1, 8, 359466) She has her own happiness and unhappiness, she has feelings and is subject to illness.
('65', 204, 1, 9, 359553) Sometimes she may not be well, sometimes her child or some other relative.
('65', 204, 1, 10, 359628) may be ill and she may be upset and this cannot but affect the quality of her spinning.
('65', 204, 1, 11, 359716) Unless your heart is made of stone, you must accept her yarn irrespective of its quality provided she does not deliberately spin bad yarn.
('65', 204, 1, 12, 359855) Her yarn must be dear to us, for it has been sanctified by her honest labour.
('65', 204, 1, 13, 359933) A mill product does not have that personal touch.
('65', 204, 1, 14, 359983) Hence, it cannot bring us this spiritual satisfaction.
('65', 204, 1, 15, 360038) Mechanicaly produced goods can merely please the eye, but the art of khadi appeals to our human feelings.
('65', 204, 1, 16, 360144) It touches the heart.
('65', 204, 1, 17, 360166) Outer beauty is a secondary matter in khadi.
('65', 204, 1, 18, 360211) That is why I have protested against the sale of bleached khadi.
('65', 204, 1, 19, 360276) Bleaching increases cost of production, weakens the material and it then becomes difficult to detect any malpractice.
('65', 204, 1, 20, 360394) Our duty is not to indiscriminately pamper the people’s taste, but to canalize it in the proper direction.
('65', 204, 1, 21, 360501) The starch in khadi automatically goes out after two or three washings and it becomes spotlessly white.
('65', 204, 1, 22, 360605) Not only this, but it also acquires a kind of softness which is destroyed by bleaching.
('65', 204, 1, 23, 360693) If the khadi wearer himself undertook these minor processes subsequent to weaving, the cost of khadi would be much less.
('65', 204, 1, 24, 360814) It is up to the khadi experts to think of the best way of inducing people to take up such processes.
('65', 204, 1, 25, 360915) If khadi activity is to be carried on not merely as a business but as a means to uplift the starving masses, we shall have to penetrate the spinner’s home.
('65', 204, 1, 26, 361071) We shall have to persuade him to wear the clothes made from the khadi produced by himself.
('65', 204, 1, 27, 361162) This no doubt means a great reduction in the cost of khadi production; it is also a total saving of the expenditure on sales.
('65', 204, 1, 28, 361288) So far we have been producing khadi, keeping the urban people in view.
('65', 204, 1, 29, 361359) From a negligible beginning khadi sales have reached millions of rupees.
('65', 204, 1, 30, 361432) We now produce many varieities of khadi.
('65', 204, 1, 31, 361473) But all this does not satisfy me.
('65', 204, 1, 32, 361507) My ambition in respect of khadi is very much higher than this.
('65', 204, 1, 33, 361570) It now extends to completely wiping out conditions of starvation from our villages.
('65', 205, 0, 1, 361654) 206 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 205, 1, 2, 361696) can be achieved only when the village people themselves produce khadi and send to the cities whatever remains after local consumption.
('65', 205, 1, 3, 361831) The secret of the power of khadi lies in the fact that it can find customers right in the place of its production.
('65', 205, 1, 4, 361946) It is not necessary to go out anywhere in search of a market for it.
('65', 205, 1, 5, 362015) The proportion of expenditure on management in khadi production pains me.
('65', 205, 1, 6, 362089) We can reduce this expenditure a lot if all the time we keep in view the main purpose of khadi.
('65', 205, 1, 7, 362185) As I have stated earlier, the methods of reducing the cost of production of manufactured goods adopted by the industries that are run for profit cannot be applied in the case of khadi.
('65', 205, 1, 8, 362370) In the case of khadi the use of machinery can be increased only within certain limits.
('65', 205, 1, 9, 362457) But there is no limit to increasing art, skill, efficiency and honesty.
('65', 205, 1, 10, 362529) If we have no faith in these we must wash our hands off khadi.
('65', 205, 1, 11, 362592) If we want to bring down the cost of khadi production, we must retain only the minimum personnel to manage the organization, and these too should be altruistic, and we should dispense with all the intermediaries and brokers.
('65', 205, 1, 12, 362817) As a matter of fact, when the khadi activity has fully developed it would have no need of an outer organization.
('65', 205, 1, 13, 362930) Self sufficiency and self propaganda are the natural characteristics of khadi.
('65', 205, 1, 14, 363009) The science of khadi is still in its infancy.
('65', 205, 1, 15, 363055) It is making steady progress.
('65', 205, 1, 16, 363085) As I go deeper into it, and do research on its laws and understand them, I realize my own limited knowledge of the subject.
('65', 205, 1, 17, 363209) With the exception of China, there is hardly any country in the world having greater resources than ours.
('65', 205, 1, 18, 363315) For today, no other country except China has man power greater than we have.
('65', 205, 1, 19, 363392) But today this wealth of ours is lying unutilized.
('65', 205, 1, 20, 363443) The spinning wheel is a means to put this wealth to use.
('65', 205, 1, 21, 363500) Hitherto we have been carrying on khadi work along proper lines.
('65', 205, 1, 22, 363565) Consequently, we have reached so far.
('65', 205, 1, 23, 363603) Not only was it inevitable, but in the situation that prevailed it alone was relevant and proper.
('65', 205, 1, 24, 363701) The real uphill task is ahead of us.
('65', 205, 1, 25, 363738) For traversing the remaining distance we shall have to follow accordingly higher standards and think of appropriate measures.
('65', 205, 1, 26, 363864) Hence, if Andhradesha aspires to have provi ncial autonomy in the matter of khadi, it can have it for the asking.
('65', 205, 1, 27, 363978) It would not be difficult even to pay up the liabilities of your organization.
('65', 205, 1, 28, 364057) That is why I have no doubt that if you wish to work along the lines I have suggested, you would be able to do it without any hindrance.

('65', 206, 10, 17, 364840) According to me there is nothing specially attractive here.
('65', 206, 10, 18, 364900) Please remember this, that out of thirty crores even one lakh people cannot come here.

('65', 207, 3, 4, 365354) BHAI HARIBHAU,
('65', 207, 4, 5, 365369) In view of the atmosphere at Ajmer 1 I feel that you and the office bearers of your group should quit the office.
('65', 207, 4, 6, 365483) It does not cast aspersion on any one of you—it is only a matter of sacrifice and restraint.
('65', 207, 4, 7, 365576) The task [you mention] can be accomplished if the climate is favourable at the time.
('65', 207, 4, 8, 365661) The regulations now formed are fully capable of creating the right atmosphere.

('65', 207, 10, 14, 365897) I had your telegram but no letter followed.
('65', 207, 10, 15, 365941) Krishna must be all right.
('65', 207, 10, 16, 365968) Sharma is somewhat disturbed.
('65', 207, 10, 17, 365998) He has gone to see Surendraji during my absence and will return to Wardha by the time I reach there.
('65', 207, 10, 18, 366099) You must be getting letters from him.
('65', 207, 10, 19, 366137) The letter you wrote about him was excellent.

('65', 208, 3, 4, 366463) SHARMA,
('65', 208, 4, 5, 366471) I have a nagging worry concerning you and the news that Surendra might not be there has added to my anxiety.
('65', 208, 4, 6, 366580) The more I reflect the more difference I find in our viewpoints.
('65', 208, 4, 7, 366645) But I do not despair.
('65', 208, 4, 8, 366667) We must continue our efforts.

('65', 208, 10, 16, 366941) I have your letter.
('65', 208, 10, 17, 366961) Yes, it is quite true that your behaviour has pained me.
('65', 208, 10, 18, 367018) My expectations could not be fulfilled.
('65', 208, 10, 19, 367058) But what can you do about it?
('65', 208, 10, 20, 367088) I reconcile myself thinking that after all you can give only what you have in you.
('65', 208, 10, 21, 367171) I hope you are keeping well.
('65', 208, 10, 22, 367200) What shall I say about Sharma?
('65', 208, 10, 23, 367231) I shall do all that I can.
('65', 208, 10, 24, 367258) I do hope to reach there on Tuesday.

('65', 209, 1, 2, 367396) 270. SPEECH AT VITHALBHAI PATEL’S DEATH ANNIVERSARY1
('65', 209, 2, 3, 367449) BOMBAY, October 22, 1934
('65', 209, 3, 4, 367474) I knew Vithalbhai from the time that I came to India in 1915. You would be surprised to know that when I first met him I had no idea that he was a Hindu.
('65', 209, 3, 5, 367628) I later came to know that he made no distinctions between Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and Christians.
('65', 209, 3, 6, 367726) He even dressed like that.
('65', 209, 3, 7, 367753) He used to grow a beard and wear a Turkish cap and a jacket.
('65', 209, 3, 8, 367814) I remained under that impression for a long time.
('65', 209, 3, 9, 367864) Then we met at Godhra in 1917. 2 There I saw him dressed like a fakir.
('65', 209, 3, 10, 367935) A meeting was arranged in the Harijan colony.
('65', 209, 3, 11, 367981) At that time very few Hindus had come there.
('65', 209, 3, 12, 368026) Vithalbhai was one of them.
('65', 209, 3, 13, 368054) In the mean time I came to know that he was a Hindu and Sardar’s elder brother.
('65', 209, 3, 14, 368134) At that time he had come dressed in short dhoti, a paheran 3 and a cap, and so I did not recognize him.
('65', 209, 3, 15, 368238) He burst out laughing.
('65', 209, 3, 16, 368261) After this we came closer day by day.
('65', 209, 3, 17, 368299) I could see that he was a great servant of the country and that he did not care for money, nor accumulated it for personal pleasure.
('65', 209, 3, 18, 368432) I used to hear about his brave work in the Bombay Legislative Assembly.
('65', 209, 3, 19, 368504) After that I also saw his career in the Congress and realized that it was no easy thing to join issue with Vithalbhai.
('65', 209, 3, 20, 368623) At times Vithalbhai opposed me; but it was a sweet opposition.
('65', 209, 3, 21, 368686) It never had any bitterness about it.
('65', 209, 3, 22, 368724) Thus we carried on together.
('65', 209, 3, 23, 368753) Vithalbhai was a fighter.
('65', 209, 3, 24, 368779) The President has described how he fought in the Central Legislative Assembly.
('65', 209, 3, 25, 368858) From the salary he received as Speaker of the Assembly, he kept a portion for himself and sent the rest to me.
('65', 209, 3, 26, 368969) That amount of Rs. 40,000 is still lying with me.
('65', 209, 3, 27, 369019) I have not been able to use it.
('65', 209, 3, 28, 369051) Then came the weary struggle.
('65', 209, 3, 29, 369081) I knew his views.
('65', 209, 3, 30, 369099) His money is lying safe with me.
('65', 209, 3, 31, 369132) I knew about Vithalbhai’s charity.
('65', 209, 3, 32, 369167) I read in the Chronicle this morning that Vithalbhai had property worth Rs. 12 lakhs out of which he had given away.
('65', 209, 3, 33, 369284) Rs. 1 lakh in charity at the time of his death.
('65', 209, 3, 34, 369332) I thought that the
('65', 209, 4, 35, 369351) 1 The meeting was held at Azad Maidan under the presidentship of Dr. M. A. Ansari.

('65', 210, 1, 2, 369581) Vithalbhai who had Rs. 12 lakhs with him could not be the same.
('65', 210, 1, 3, 369645) If he had given that money to Vallabhbhai, my hand would certainly delve into the latter’s pocket.
('65', 210, 1, 4, 369744) But Vithalbhai was too shrewd [to make a mistake].
('65', 210, 1, 5, 369795) So, I thought the Chronicle must have made a mistake.
('65', 210, 1, 6, 369849) It could not be that Vithalbhai had left behind Rs. 12 lakhs out of which he gave only one lakh in charity and kept 11 lakhs for his relatives.
('65', 210, 1, 7, 369993) So I thought the compositor must have made some mistake.
('65', 210, 1, 8, 370050) If the Chronicle is right, Vithalbhai must have stolen the money.
('65', 210, 1, 9, 370116) Vithalbhai must have been a speculator.
('65', 210, 1, 10, 370156) But the only speculation he ever did was about swaraj.
('65', 210, 1, 11, 370211) We have gathered here to remember him on his death anniversary.
('65', 210, 1, 12, 370275) On my way here I heard in the train that Bhulabhai is the chairman of a committee appointed to erect a memorial to him.
('65', 210, 1, 13, 370395) It is not enough that you merely hear his praises and go away.
('65', 210, 1, 14, 370458) If you resolve to give for Vithalbhai’s memorial something from what you may be getting, you would have done your bit to repay the debt we owe to Vithalbhai.
('65', 210, 1, 15, 370616) I remember many instances of Vithalbhai’s sharp intelligence and efficiency, but I have no time to narrate them now.
('65', 210, 1, 16, 370733) I have spoken in brief of his sacrifice and service and of how we can emulate his patriotism.

('65', 210, 5, 20, 370922) October 23, 1934
('65', 210, 6, 21, 370939) In the course of his statement Mahatmaji said that he hoped that the members of the Subjects Committee would agree with him in his decision that his retirement was a necessity at the present moment.
('65', 210, 6, 22, 371138) He would certainly work and help the Congress while remaining outside.
('65', 210, 6, 23, 371209) The conclusion which he had arrived at after a long deliberation would not be changed.
('65', 210, 6, 24, 371296) He had already informed 2 the public the reasons that had prompted him to take the decision to retire.
('65', 210, 6, 25, 371399) He had felt that he had become a drag, a hamper on the natural progress of the Congress.
('65', 210, 6, 26, 371488) It had been the experience of
('65', 210, 7, 27, 371518) 1 Presided over by Rajendra Prasad.
('65', 210, 7, 28, 371554) Gandhiji spoke in Hindi.
('65', 210, 7, 29, 371579) 2 Vide “Statement to the press”, 17 9 1934 and “Statement to the press”, 15 10 1934.
('65', 211, 0, 1, 371664) 212 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 211, 1, 2, 371706) the Mahatma that during the past few years Congressmen had begun to follow and obey his orders and accepted whatever he had told them although they did not believe in what he said.
('65', 211, 1, 3, 371887) Under the circumstances he felt that if he continued any further it would not be in the interests of the country or of the Congress.
('65', 211, 1, 4, 372020) He had remained at the helm of affairs for long and had taken the Congress as far as he could and he felt that he could not lead them any further.
('65', 211, 1, 5, 372167) It would be wrong to say, said the speaker, that Congressmen had not co operated with him in the progress that has so far been made.
('65', 211, 1, 6, 372300) According to the speaker certain things were necessary for the attainment of purna swaraj and he felt that they would strengthen the Congress.
('65', 211, 2, 7, 372443) He was not going out as a protest against anything inside the Congress.
('65', 211, 2, 8, 372515) He was going out so that Congressmen could think and act for themselves.
('65', 211, 2, 9, 372588) So far Congressmen had acted like blind men going round and round the same pole.
('65', 211, 2, 10, 372669) His retirement did not in any way mean that he was not ready to come back whenever his help was needed.
('65', 211, 2, 11, 372773) He was not going out with any bad intention in his mind.
('65', 211, 2, 12, 372830) He was not anxious to do any harm to the Congress, nor was he going to form a strong party outside the party.
('65', 211, 2, 13, 372940) The speaker asked as to what purpose he would be serving if he went out to form a party in his 65th year and what more help and co operation could he expect to get from those outsiders than what the Congressmen had so far given in trying to achieve the objective.
('65', 211, 3, 14, 373204) Continuing, Gandhiji said that he hoped that he would be given permission by the members of the Subjects Committee to retire.
('65', 211, 3, 15, 373330) Although he had come to the decision to retire, he had felt it his duty to consult the members of the Subjects Committee.
('65', 211, 3, 16, 373452) It is possible that some might say that they had expressed their opinion on his retirement and amendments in the Press but still Gandhiji felt that he should discuss it with Congressmen.
('65', 211, 4, 17, 373639) The members of the Working Committee had discussed the question with him.
('65', 211, 4, 18, 373713) Some of them thought that his retirement would be a disaster to the cause of the country, while there were others who agreed with him that he should retire, and it would help the country, the Congress and himself.
('65', 211, 4, 19, 373927) That would help the Congress to get a clear view of things.
('65', 211, 5, 20, 373987) He had proposed in his original statement three amendments to the Congress constitution.
('65', 211, 5, 21, 374076) The first was about the creed and that was not acceptable to many.
('65', 211, 5, 22, 374143) Let it not be taken for granted that he would remain inside the Congress if all the three amendments, which would be moved by some of the members of the Working Committee, would be accepted.
('65', 211, 5, 23, 374334) He had come to a decision and would stick to it.
('65', 211, 5, 24, 374383) Whether the Subjects Committee accepted one or all the three or threw away all of them, it did not alter the decision he had taken.
('65', 211, 5, 25, 374515) Because even if all the amendments are passed, there are several things which had made him come to the conclusion about
('65', 212, 0, 1, 374635) VOL.65: 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 213
('65', 212, 1, 2, 374684) retirement.
('65', 212, 1, 3, 374696) If something miraculous happened or if they convinced him that his presence was essential in the interest of the country, he might some day return to them.
('65', 212, 2, 4, 374852) Several members from Madras and Bengal supported the suggestion.
('65', 212, 2, 5, 374917) Mahatma Gandhi was surprised that there were members of the A. I. C. C. who did not know Hindustani.
('65', 212, 3, 6, 375018) [GANDHIJI:] This request is a sound reason why I should leave the Congress.
('65', 212, 3, 7, 375094) (Laughter)
('65', 212, 4, 8, 375105) The member concerned, not baffled, said, “We want you here, to be able to learn Hindi”, to which Mr. Gandhi retorted:
('65', 212, 5, 9, 375223) If you couldn’t learn it in the last 15 years, I have proved an indifferent teacher and it is time you changed your teacher.
('65', 212, 5, 10, 375348) (Laughter)
('65', 212, 6, 11, 375359) Addressing the meeting in English, Mr. Gandhi said:
('65', 212, 7, 12, 375411) What I said in Hindi is that if I retire from the Congress, I want to retire, if possible, with your blessings.
('65', 212, 7, 13, 375523) I want you to feel also that I do not retire in a huff and that I strongly desire to go out of the Congress in order that the Congress may flourish and grow to its full height and grow to its natural height.
('65', 212, 7, 14, 375731) At the present moment, somehow or other, I am weighed down with the feeling that the Cong ress is being suppressed by my presence and that the Congress is not giving natural expression to its views.
('65', 212, 7, 15, 375930) Therefore, it has become an artificial body and nothing can be so harmful to the growth of an institution or a nation than that it allows itself to be suppressed even for the sake of love.
('65', 212, 7, 16, 376119) It is not then love or, even if it is love, it is of a repressive quality.
('65', 212, 7, 17, 376194) This excess ought to be thrown out.
('65', 212, 7, 18, 376230) Take my own position.
('65', 212, 7, 19, 376252) The feeling has been creeping over me not for a few days but for months past.
('65', 212, 7, 20, 376330) I do want you to dismiss from your mind the idea that has been expressed in some quarters that certain letters from Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had anything whatever to do with this intense yearning for retirement.
('65', 212, 7, 21, 376541) These letters perhaps hastened the announcement of the decision, but nothing else.
('65', 212, 8, 22, 376624) 1 Sarojini Naidu then suggested that for the sake of those who did not understand Hindustani, Gandhiji might summarize his statement in English.
('65', 212, 8, 23, 376769) 2 What follows is from The Hindu.
('65', 213, 0, 1, 376803) 214 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 213, 1, 2, 376845) feeling was given expression to by me to friends in Bengal.
('65', 213, 1, 3, 376905) I told Dr. Roy and others on the railway station platform that if we cannot get rid of artificiality, of corruption and overpowering desire to wrangle, if we cannot possibly cleanse ourselves of these things, I must retire from the Congress.
('65', 213, 1, 4, 377147) You will find expressions like these uttered even before they were said in Bengal.
('65', 213, 1, 5, 377230) This idea has been possessing me day after day till the time came when I could restrain it no longer.
('65', 213, 1, 6, 377332) That is the history of that decision.
('65', 213, 1, 7, 377370) There is not the slightest desire on my part to forsake the post of duty or give up Congress work.
('65', 213, 1, 8, 377469) I am leaving the Congress to lift the weight which has been suppressing it, in order that it may grow and I may grow myself.
('65', 213, 1, 9, 377594) After all I cannot withhold this much from you, that I am leaving in order to develop the power that non violence has—non violence in thought, word and deed, unadulterated non violence.
('65', 213, 1, 10, 377780) I borrowed the expression ‘Civil Disobedience’ and extended its meaning by calling it civil resistance.
('65', 213, 1, 11, 377884) I have no doubt purna swaraj cannot be achieved without civil resistance.
('65', 213, 1, 12, 377958) We may not offer resistance till I shall feel confident that the spirit permeates not one or two men like myself or even a thousand men like ourselves, but that it permeates the entire society.
('65', 213, 2, 13, 378152) Mr. Gandhi added that human nature was pervaded by non violence and his own researches and experiments had borne that out.
('65', 213, 3, 14, 378275) 1 do not believe—1 must frankly confess to you—in the socalled constitutional means for giving liberty to any people.
('65', 213, 3, 15, 378393) I know no historical instance of pure constitutional agitation, as we have been told and as it has been described to us in text books, having ever clothed a nation with liberty.
('65', 213, 3, 16, 378571) I cannot claim to have read the history of all nations.
('65', 213, 3, 17, 378627) I have not the historical instinct, but from what I know I can say that constitutional agitation never regained lost liberty.
('65', 213, 3, 18, 378753) It is in the nature of things impossible.
('65', 213, 3, 19, 378795) It is not a gift that can be made by one nation to another or by one person to another.
('65', 213, 4, 20, 378883) Mr. Gandhi recalled that the use of the expression that there shall be non violence in thought, word and deed, did not get inserted by accident, but after a big debate, at the Ahmedabad Congress 1, initiated by Mr. Hasrat Mohani.
('65', 213, 4, 21, 379113) Mr. Gandhi

('65', 214, 1, 2, 379314) continued:
('65', 214, 2, 3, 379325) I tacked civil resistance to the spinning wheel and to other acts of mine.
('65', 214, 2, 4, 379400) I consider them all one.
('65', 214, 2, 5, 379425) I have said that Hindu Muslim unity is necessary, not unity in the form of patched up pacts between politicians, but living unity.
('65', 214, 3, 6, 379556) Mr. Gandhi said that he had agreed previously to launching the campaign of civil resistance, like a drowning man catching at a straw and added:
('65', 214, 4, 7, 379700) I felt if it went wrong, I will have no hesitation in pulling up even at the risk of incurring your strong displeasure.
('65', 214, 4, 8, 379820) I plunged into these things merely by way of experiment, but if we are to prove it by our experiment, we have to admit that it was civil resistance which was not non violent in thought, word or deed.
('65', 214, 4, 9, 380020) Civil Disobedience cannot be taken up until there is the atmosphere for it.
('65', 214, 4, 10, 380096) If I remain in the Congress, I shall be imposing myself upon you.
('65', 214, 4, 11, 380162) You may say that I am not imposing myself, but I feel that I am and it is better that I retire.
('65', 214, 4, 12, 380258) And if you prove that you are non violent, then whether I am on Mount Everest or have gone down to the bowels of the earth, I shall appear and lead you to your goal and we shall march in perfect safety.
('65', 214, 4, 13, 380461) If we are non violent in word, thought and deed, then this ordinance rule would have been utterly impossible.
('65', 214, 4, 14, 380571) I cannot change my mind on the cardinal doctrines of the charkha, Hindu Muslim unity and removal of untouchability, without which you cannot even understand the principles of nonviolence or free the Congress from greed and selfishness.
('65', 214, 4, 15, 380807) These fundamental things, which are part of our creed, should come naturally to us.
('65', 214, 4, 16, 380891) I may be told that I am asking human nature to give me too much.
('65', 214, 4, 17, 380956) That may be so.
('65', 214, 4, 18, 380972) It does not show that I am wrong in not being able to remain in this institution.
('65', 214, 4, 19, 381054) Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan told me that he had made up his mind in Hazaribagh that I should retire and he with me.
('65', 214, 4, 20, 381166) I told him, ‘‘If you are a soldier, you must remain at your post and see whether you cannot take the nation up to the point where you have arrived, in spite of the fact that you have come from a land steeped in violence.” I, therefore, plead with you to let me go with your blessing and not plead with me that ‘if you remain, we shall do this’.
('65', 214, 4, 21, 381511) I want you to give me nothing as a bargain.
('65', 214, 4, 22, 381555) I have not come in a bargaining spirit.
('65', 215, 0, 1, 381595) 216 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 215, 1, 2, 381637) been struggling with the Working Committee, a majority of whom are in favour of my going out with a blessing.
('65', 215, 1, 3, 381747) There is a tough minority which says I must not go out, though the minority has also come to the conclusion that if I feel that, even after listening to their argument, I cannot change my view, I must go.
('65', 215, 1, 4, 381952) I must not be held down by simple force, even the force of love.
('65', 215, 1, 5, 382017) I must act up to the dictates of my intellect and my faith.
('65', 215, 2, 6, 382077) Another point is in connection with the three vital amendments.
('65', 215, 2, 7, 382141) They have felt so convinced of the necessity of the substance of those three amendments that they will be putting them before you presently in spite of the fact that, as soon as I receive your blessing, I shall retire at the end of the session.
('65', 215, 3, 8, 382386) Mahatmaji told the members that they should make no speeches.
('65', 215, 3, 9, 382448) He would give them only 20 minutes to express their views briefly.
('65', 215, 4, 10, 382515) Let me be a dictator for 20 minutes.
('65', 215, 4, 11, 382552) (Laughter)
('65', 215, 5, 12, 382563) In reply to a question, Mahatmaji said like Columbus he would go out of the Congress to discover a method to convince them of the value of nonviolent civil resistance and like all discoverers would return to them triumphantly with his discovery.
('65', 215, 6, 13, 382809) Mr. Sri Prakasa said that Mr. Gandhi had stated that wrangles in the Congress organization were responsible for his decision.
('65', 215, 7, 14, 382935) MR. GANDHI: No, I said I had become a deadweight on the Congress.
('65', 215, 8, 15, 383001) Mr. Sri Prakasa appealed to Mr. Gandhi to help them to set their house in order.
('65', 215, 9, 16, 383082) Just after Mr. Sri Prakasa had finished his speech the time limit was over and Pandit Malaviya wanted to address the House.
('65', 215, 9, 17, 383206) Gandhiji said that the time limit was over but if Panditji did want to speak no power on earth could stop him from doing so.
('65', 215, 10, 18, 383331) Pandit Malaviya made an impassioned appeal to Mr. Gandhi not to leave the Congress at this juncture, when it was in the midst of its fight for the freedom of the country.
('65', 215, 10, 19, 383502) He said that, if there were mistakes and shortcomings on the part of the
('65', 215, 11, 20, 383575) 1 The following three paragraphs are from The Bombay Chronicle.
('65', 215, 11, 21, 383639) Gandhiji then invited the members to ask questions.
('65', 215, 11, 22, 383691) 2 The following three paragraphs are from The Hindu.
('65', 215, 11, 23, 383744) 3 The following paragraph is from The Bombay Chronicle.
('65', 216, 0, 1, 383800) VOL.65: 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 217
('65', 216, 1, 2, 383849) Congressmen, he should point them out and see that these were rectified but should not make them the justification for leaving the Congress.
('65', 216, 1, 3, 383990) He had no right to leave the Congress, after having led it for 13 or 14 years.
('65', 216, 1, 4, 384069) “Whatever you want to do from outside the Congress you can do from within it,” added the Pandit.
('65', 216, 1, 5, 384166) “The farther away you are from the Congress, the greater will be the sorrow of the country.” He asked Mr. Gandhi not to be too strict with the masses in regard to the observance of truth and non violence in the same degree as he (Mr. Gandhi) himself was observing.
('65', 216, 1, 6, 384431) “You have a proper cabinet with you.
('65', 216, 1, 7, 384468) Your soldiers are ready to follow you in the fight.
('65', 216, 1, 8, 384520) Why do you want to leave all these to themselves and go out of the Congress?
('65', 216, 1, 9, 384597) I make a personal appeal to you, with all my love and regard for you not to retire at this juncture.” 1
('65', 216, 2, 10, 384701) Gandhiji, replying to the several questions that had been raised by the speakers, said that he had considered Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya as his elder brother since 1915. If the speaker could carry out the wishes of the Pandit, he would have very gladly done so, considering his wishes as the command of an elder brother.
('65', 216, 2, 11, 385023) But he felt that he could not help but leave the Congress under the cricumstances.
('65', 216, 2, 12, 385106) He was leaving the organization because he was anxious to strengthen it.
('65', 216, 3, 13, 385179) He was going out to get shanti (peace).
('65', 216, 3, 14, 385219) He was going out so that he might develop strength to serve the Congress and the country.
('65', 216, 3, 15, 385309) He said:
('65', 216, 4, 16, 385318) I feel today that I have lost the power to presuade you to my view.
('65', 216, 4, 17, 385386) I have become helpless.
('65', 216, 4, 18, 385410) It is no use keeping a man like me at the helm of affairs, who has lost his strength.
('65', 216, 4, 19, 385496) You have said nothing that will make me reconsider my decision.
('65', 216, 4, 20, 385560) I do not think that it is hasty on my part to do so, but rest assured that even when I go out I will be a humble servant of the Congress.
('65', 216, 5, 21, 385698) Mr. Gandhi stated that it was doubly profitable for them to allow him to retire, for thereby they would have his services, whenever they needed them, but at the same time, they would not have to pay a price for it, as they had to do at present.
('65', 216, 6, 22, 385943) He would certainly give his opinion, if asked for on any question.
('65', 216, 7, 23, 386010) At present, he was leaving the Congress with the main intention of .
('65', 216, 7, 24, 386079) working for the Congress.
('65', 216, 8, 25, 386105) Pandit Malaviya, interrupting, said that it was not fair on the part of the Mahatma to retire without sufficient notice.
('65', 216, 8, 26, 386226) It was the duty of every servant, whether paid or honorary, to give proper notice of retirement from the work that had been entrusted to him.
('65', 216, 8, 27, 386368) He said, “It is for 14 years that you have been at the head of the

('65', 217, 0, 1, 386547) 218 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 217, 1, 2, 386589) Congress.
('65', 217, 1, 3, 386599) Do not be in haste to retire.
('65', 217, 1, 4, 386629) Give these people time to make proper arrangements for the great work of reorganizing the Congress, which is before them.
('65', 217, 1, 5, 386751) Give them at least four or six months, if not more.”
('65', 217, 2, 6, 386804) Replying to the charge of being hasty, Mr. Gandhi said he was a fighter and knew his duty as a soldier.
('65', 217, 2, 7, 386908) The first duty of a satyagrahi was to stick to his post.
('65', 217, 2, 8, 386965) He felt that he was not leaving his post of duty.
('65', 217, 2, 9, 387015) If he felt it was a mistake on his part to have retired from the Congress, he would come back without even waiting for an invitation.
('65', 217, 3, 10, 387149) But the position at present is that I am absolutely helpless.
('65', 217, 3, 11, 387211) My mind does not work.
('65', 217, 3, 12, 387234) I am not a foolish general to continue to be at the head of the force when I feel that no good would come out of it.
('65', 217, 3, 13, 387351) A man who gave an ultimatum to Lord Reading, the GovernorGeneral of India, regarding Bardoli 1 cannot be expected to run away from the battle.
('65', 217, 4, 14, 387494) Unless a miracle happened there was no possibility of his continuing to lead the Congress.
('65', 217, 4, 15, 387585) He hoped that God would give strength both to him and Congressmen so that they might come together again soon.
('65', 217, 5, 16, 387696) As for the fear that his retirement would create difficulties for the Congress Parliamentary Board, Mr. Gandhi said that he did not believe it.
('65', 217, 5, 17, 387840) I am certain that you will not lose one single vote during the coming elections.
('65', 217, 5, 18, 387921) If I had feared that it would harm your work, I would not have retired.
('65', 217, 5, 19, 387993) I finally appeal to you to allow me to retire and tolerate me, just as a family willingly tolerates any of its helpless members.

('65', 218, 2, 3, 388372) BOMBAY, October 24, 1934
('65', 218, 3, 4, 388397) SHARMA, I read your long letter, which both pained and pleased me.
('65', 218, 3, 5, 388464) I was pained because the letter expresses well the turmoil in your heart and I was pleased because I found your heart to be pure.
('65', 218, 3, 6, 388594) But I suspect you are suppressing yourself.
('65', 218, 3, 7, 388638) I do not like your working beyond your strength.
('65', 218, 3, 8, 388687) Your heart I find is with me but your reason revolts.
('65', 218, 3, 9, 388741) You doubt my wisdom.
('65', 218, 3, 10, 388762) You view my associates with suspicion.
('65', 218, 3, 11, 388801) How can I calm you in such a state?
('65', 218, 3, 12, 388837) I also feel that you sorely miss Draupadi.
('65', 218, 3, 13, 388880) You may certainly go to Khurja if that is required.
('65', 218, 3, 14, 388932) You can take the money from Naraharibhai.
('65', 218, 3, 15, 388974) But if you do not have to go you should stay on there, wait for Surendra, and come away after seeing him.
('65', 218, 3, 16, 389080) Anyhow write another letter to me.
('65', 218, 3, 17, 389115) I shall be here till Monday if not longer.

('65', 218, 7, 21, 389329) October 24, 1934
('65', 218, 8, 22, 389346) Whereas organizations claiming to advance swadeshi have sprung up all over the country with and without the assistance of Congressmen and whereas much confusion has arisen in the public mind as to the true nature of swadeshi and whereas the aim of the Congress has been from its inception progressive identification with the masses and whereas village re organization and reconstruction is one of the items of the constructive programme of the Congress and whereas such reconstruction necessarily implies the revival and
('65', 218, 9, 23, 389867) 1 At the request of Rajendra Prasad, who was in the Chair, Gandhiji moved the resolution on the All India Village Industries Association
('65', 219, 0, 1, 390004) 220 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 219, 1, 2, 390046) encouragement of dead or dying village industries, besides the central industry of hand spinning, and whereas this work, like the re organization of hand spinning, is possible only through concentrated and special effort unaffected by and independent of the political activities of the Congress, Mr. J. C. Kumarappa is.
('65', 219, 1, 3, 390366) hereby authorized to form under the advice and guidance of Mr. Gandhi an association called the All India Village Industries Association, as part of the activities of the Congress.
('65', 219, 2, 4, 390547) The said Association shall work for the revival and en couragement of the said industries and for the moral and physical advancement of the villages and shall have the power to frame its own constitution, to raise funds and perform such acts as may be necessary for the fulfilment of its objects.
('65', 219, 2, 5, 390844) Commending the resolution to the house, Gandhiji said: 2
('65', 219, 3, 6, 390901) During my Harijan tour this year, a large number of people used to come to me to narrate their tales of woe.
('65', 219, 3, 7, 391010) Never before had I travelled as I did during this tour.
('65', 219, 3, 8, 391066) And, in Utkal, I had an extraordinary experience since I was touring on foot.
('65', 219, 3, 9, 391144) There is no limit to the state of unemployment in our seven lac villages.
('65', 219, 3, 10, 391218) The people subsist on agriculture.
('65', 219, 3, 11, 391253) And millions of people suffer losses in agriculture.
('65', 219, 3, 12, 391306) And what can we say about the present state?
('65', 219, 3, 13, 391351) Today the farmers do not produce enough even for the seeds.
('65', 219, 3, 14, 391411) You can hardly find such poverty anywhere else.
('65', 219, 3, 15, 391459) That is also one of the reasons why people disposed of gold worth lacs of rupees.
('65', 219, 3, 16, 391541) This has of course its political reason.
('65', 219, 3, 17, 391582) But the helplessness of the people was also one reason.
('65', 219, 3, 18, 391638) The spinning wheel has emerged to meet this unemployment.
('65', 219, 3, 19, 391696) Apart from India there is perhaps no other country where people depend so completely on agriculture.
('65', 219, 3, 20, 391797) Madhusudan Das had said that village people must be provided with some additional occupation.
('65', 219, 3, 21, 391891) He had gone to Germany and learnt leather work.
('65', 219, 3, 22, 391939) I have always remembered his one remark that those who always work with oxen must have bovine intelligence.
('65', 219, 3, 23, 392047) Our farmers lost their work and became dull minded.
('65', 219, 3, 24, 392099) A friend left a socialist paper with me.
('65', 219, 3, 25, 392140) It contains a nice article.
('65', 219, 3, 26, 392168) It says that the people of India are being reduced to subhuman state.
('65', 219, 3, 27, 392238) Ten years ago there were many industries, but now they have become dependent solely on agriculture, and this has led to increase in

('65', 220, 1, 2, 392534) unemployment.
('65', 220, 1, 3, 392548) The only point I learnt from it was regarding the remedy for this unemployment.
('65', 220, 1, 4, 392628) When I thought about it the concept of swadeshi emerged in its precise form.
('65', 220, 1, 5, 392705) We are able to provide work to 2,20,000 women spinners through khadi alone.
('65', 220, 1, 6, 392781) We have given them three crores in ten years.
('65', 220, 1, 7, 392827) There are 1,100 men from the middle class who supervise this work and earn their bread.
('65', 220, 1, 8, 392915) This amount has been distributed through them.
('65', 220, 1, 9, 392962) This work is being carried on in five to six thousand villages.
('65', 220, 1, 10, 393026) The capital involved is not more than 20 lacs.
('65', 220, 1, 11, 393073) But this is not enough to solve completely India’s problem of unemployment.
('65', 220, 1, 12, 393149) Let me cite the instance of carpenters.
('65', 220, 1, 13, 393189) Our carpenters were good craftsmen at one time.
('65', 220, 1, 14, 393237) Today they have lost the skill.
('65', 220, 1, 15, 393269) Today the village carpenters cannot make even a spinning wheel.
('65', 220, 1, 16, 393333) Take Bihar for instance.
('65', 220, 1, 17, 393358) There sand has piled up in the fields and tilling has become impossible.
('65', 220, 1, 18, 393431) Instead of giving free food to the starving people there, it was decided to provide them with spinning wheels.
('65', 220, 1, 19, 393542) But from where to find the spinning wheels?
('65', 220, 1, 20, 393586) The local carpenters could hardly make them.
('65', 220, 1, 21, 393631) In our country the urban population is only 30 million.
('65', 220, 1, 22, 393687) The remaining 320 million live in the villages with a population of less than ten thousand.
('65', 220, 1, 23, 393779) We have never cared for them.
('65', 220, 1, 24, 393809) Rather than being concerned about what they cat, drink and what occupations they follow we have simply got upon their backs.
('65', 220, 1, 25, 393934) I am asking you to adopt the spinning wheel for their sake.
('65', 220, 1, 26, 393994) But you do not like even that.
('65', 220, 1, 27, 394025) Now the Charkha Sangh is providing the spinning wheels for them.
('65', 220, 1, 28, 394090) But the work that remains to be done after that will be undertaken by this new Association.
('65', 220, 1, 29, 394182) It will be found that other occupations apart from the spinning wheel can be carried on by people in their homes.
('65', 220, 1, 30, 394296) They will revive the industries that can be revived.
('65', 220, 1, 31, 394349) They will devise ways and means of improving the quality of what is already being produced, and find out what new things can be produced.
('65', 220, 1, 32, 394487) They will thus bring a few more millions to the poor.
('65', 220, 1, 33, 394541) You have not taken as much interest in the spinning wheel as I had expected.
('65', 220, 1, 34, 394618) It was hoped to save through the spinning wheel and khadi the 600 million rupees going out of the country in the purchase of foreign cloth.
('65', 220, 1, 35, 394758) But this hope has not been fulfilled.
('65', 220, 2, 36, 394796) His proposal did not mean that they should part with their money and gift it to villagers.
('65', 220, 2, 37, 394887) All he meant was that, instead of spending money on buying other goods, they should buy goods

('65', 221, 0, 1, 395032) 222 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 221, 1, 2, 395074) manufactured by villagers.
('65', 221, 1, 3, 395101) Thus they would keep the money in India and distribute among villagers crores of rupees.
('65', 221, 1, 4, 395190) He appealed to the House to vote on the resolution on its ‘ merits and not because they might persuade him to remain in the Congress.
('65', 221, 1, 5, 395324) On this latter subject, he would hear what more Mr. Sidhwa had to say, if the President allowed the resolution to be moved.
('65', 221, 1, 6, 395448) He also made it clear that he was not setting up an association with a view to using it to rouse political consciousness among the masses.
('65', 221, 1, 7, 395587) He did not propose even to mention the name of the Congress in the course of this work, in the same way as he had not asked workers in the Spinners’ Association to join the Congress.
('65', 221, 1, 8, 395770) To him, however, political consciousness had a different meaning.
('65', 221, 1, 9, 395836) If the Association succeeded in reviving industries and improving the present method of work in villages, that would be enough political consciousness.
('65', 221, 2, 10, 395988) This Association will be related to the Congress exactly like the Charkha Sangh.
('65', 221, 2, 11, 396069) Shankerlal, Jamnalalji and others manage the Charkha Sangh but the Congress can still look into its working.
('65', 221, 2, 12, 396178) Kumarappa belongs to the Congress.
('65', 221, 2, 13, 396213) At present he is keeping account of our millions of rupees in Bihar.
('65', 221, 2, 14, 396282) He was the Secretary of the committee appointed by the Congress to inquire into the liabilities thrust on India by the Government.
('65', 221, 2, 15, 396413) He is a chartered accountant and he has made a great sacrifice.
('65', 221, 2, 16, 396477) He does not crave for money.
('65', 221, 2, 17, 396506) He is interested in this kind of work.
('65', 221, 2, 18, 396545) I have discussed the matter with him and he has agreed to do this work under my supervision.
('65', 221, 2, 19, 396638) I do not wish to take up this work as a political activity, but to help the poor unemployed village people earn a few coins.
('65', 221, 2, 20, 396763) That is why I wish to keep this work free from politics.
('65', 221, 2, 21, 396820) You will be surprised to know that not a single person from among the 2,20,000 spinners, 20,000 carders and 20,000 weavers to whom the Charkha Sangh provides work is a member of the Congress.
('65', 221, 2, 22, 397012) The Congress constitution has accepted spinning franchise.
('65', 221, 2, 23, 397071) Hence, they can all become members if they want to.
('65', 221, 2, 24, 397123) But we have made no such effort.
('65', 221, 2, 25, 397156) Even by not joining the Congress they are not going to remain unacquainted with the political activity in the country.
('65', 221, 2, 26, 397275) But they must know that we have gone to them to serve them and not with the intention of exploiting them for our political objectives.
('65', 221, 2, 27, 397410) This resolution involves no financial responsibility for the Congress, only
('65', 221, 3, 28, 397486) 1 What follows is translated from the Gujarati in Harijanbandhu.
('65', 222, 0, 1, 397551) VOL.65: 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 223
('65', 222, 1, 2, 397600) the name of the Congress is required.
('65', 222, 1, 3, 397638) Accept this resolution if you are in favour of it.
('65', 222, 2, 4, 397689) Gandhiji in replying to the several questions that had arisen from the discussions said that the first amendment wanted that the words “dead and dying” should be deleted from the resolution while the second wanted the replacement of certain words.
('65', 222, 2, 5, 397937) 2 The work of the Association would be to revive the industries that were ruined or dead or were in the state of dying.
('65', 222, 2, 6, 398057) The work as to which of the industries should be revived and which should be allowed to die away was to be left to the Association.
('65', 222, 2, 7, 398189) By the revival of the village industries it was the intention of the resolution not only to help the villages financially but improve them morally and physically as well.
('65', 222, 2, 8, 398360) It was not the intention of the movers of the resolution that the villagers should be exploited, but they wanted to help them.
('65', 222, 2, 9, 398487) The Congress was not going to approach the villagers as anybody’s agents.
('65', 222, 2, 10, 398561) It was the intention of the Congress to find out why people were working for 18 hours, if there were any so working.
('65', 222, 2, 11, 398678) The speaker wanted that everyone would work not more than 9 hours and that could be, done by increasing the earning capacity of the villagers.
('65', 222, 2, 12, 398821) For this the speaker wanted the help of those who were well off and could sacrifice a little more for the sake of the villagers by paying for the articles manufactured by the village artisans.
('65', 222, 2, 13, 399014) Today the condition was such that even if they worked for 18 hours they did not get enough to make both ends meet.
('65', 222, 2, 14, 399129) This could be done by the speaker and others of the Association when they went and mixed with the villagers freely and gained their confidence.
('65', 222, 2, 15, 399273) Continuing, Gandhiji said that his report that would be submitted to the Congress at a future date would be to say what the condition of the village industries was when he took up the work and what it had achieved in so many days.
('65', 222, 2, 16, 399504) For such a work in the seven lacs of villages in India it was necessary that Acharya Kripalanis and Dr. Roys and advocates should work hand in hand.
('65', 222, 3, 17, 399653) 1 Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan seconded the resolution.
('65', 222, 3, 18, 399704) What follows is from The Bombay Chronicle.
('65', 222, 3, 19, 399747) 2 Dr. Sanyal in his second amendment wanted the words “the said industries and for the moral and physical advancement of the villages” to be replaced by “such village industries as after due enquiry are found to possess sufficient economic vitality and are likely to bring permanent economic relief to the people”.
('65', 223, 0, 1, 400062) 224 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 223, 1, 2, 400104) Referring to Mr. Muzumdar’s al amendment 1 Gandhiji said that he was bewildered when he found that a man of the type of Mr. T. Prakasam supported the amendment and said that because Congressmen were going to the Assembly the work could be better achieved by them inside the Legislature.
('65', 223, 2, 3, 400391) Gandhiji wanted to assure the Subjects Committee that the duty of the Parliamentarians did not end by their entering the Legislature.
('65', 223, 2, 4, 400525) They would certainly be expected to work for the Industries Association also.
('65', 223, 2, 5, 400603) But it must be understood that the organization would have no connection with politics.
('65', 223, 3, 6, 400691) Explaining why he wanted the organization to be independent of politics, Mr. Gandhi said that if he tried both things at one time, he would not be able to achieve either.
('65', 223, 4, 7, 400862) There is a special reason why this Association has been kept out of the Congress politics.
('65', 223, 4, 8, 400953) This work must continue irrespective of the political situation.
('65', 223, 4, 9, 401018) We go to the people to serve them.
('65', 223, 4, 10, 401053) Let us not whisper politics in their ears.
('65', 223, 4, 11, 401096) We go to them to improve their health, to free them from disease, to raise them from squalor, to reduce unem ployment by giving them occupation.
('65', 223, 4, 12, 401241) We cannot bring in politics if this is our aim.
('65', 223, 4, 13, 401289) Even when the Congress was banned the Charkha Sangh was not banned and its work went on.
('65', 223, 4, 14, 401378) That Association belongs to the Congress none the less.
('65', 223, 4, 15, 401434) But it has kept away from Congress politics.
('65', 223, 4, 16, 401479) The new Association too will have the same position.
('65', 223, 4, 17, 401532) I had said the same thing at Karachi 4. Those who opposed me at that time told me afterwards that what I had said was correct.
('65', 223, 4, 18, 401659) My advice was that the Anti untouchability League and the Prohibition Committee be kept away from politics, and it was sound advice.
('65', 223, 4, 19, 401792) A friend pointed out that Kumarappa and others would attend to this work; in that case, what work would be left for the Congressmen?
('65', 223, 4, 20, 401925) It is not so.
('65', 223, 4, 21, 401939) It will have a place for every Congressman who has faith in this programme.
('65', 223, 4, 22, 402015) Today, there are 1,100 workers in the Charkha Sangh who are all Congressmen.
('65', 223, 5, 23, 402092) 1 Basant Kumar Muzumdar wanted the House to decide whether the activities of the organization should be outside the scope of the Congress.
('65', 223, 5, 24, 402231) 2 The following paragraph is from The Hindu.
('65', 223, 5, 25, 402276) 3 What follows is translated from the Gujarati in Harijanhandhu.
('65', 223, 5, 26, 402341) 4 The March 1931 5 The following paragraph is from The Bombay Chronicle.
('65', 224, 0, 1, 402414) VOL.65: 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 225
('65', 224, 1, 2, 402463) Referring to the suspicion that seems to be entertained in certain quarters against his starting these organizations outside the Congress with little.
('65', 224, 1, 3, 402614) connection with the parent body, Gandhiji said that it should not be forgotten that even a Mahatma and an economic expert put together could achieve very little, if the whole scheme was not going to be worked out by Congressmen themselves.
('65', 224, 1, 4, 402854) Though outside help would also be taken, the main help had to come from amongst the tried workers of the Congress.
('65', 224, 2, 5, 402969) Bhai Govind Sahai says that I am talking things of the bygone ages and that I am an arch enemy of machines.
('65', 224, 2, 6, 403077) He has read my writings with a distorted view.
('65', 224, 2, 7, 403124) 2 Is not this charkha in front of me a machine?
('65', 224, 2, 8, 403172) We do want machines but do not wish to become their slaves.
('65', 224, 2, 9, 403232) We should make the machine our slave.
('65', 224, 2, 10, 403270) ‘our slave, means slave not of the rich but of the poor.
('65', 224, 2, 11, 403327) I accept money from the rich for the sake of the poor, but does it therefore lay me under an obligation to help them if I may collect five thousand rupees from a mill owner or an iron manufacturer?
('65', 224, 2, 12, 403525) Those who would give must do it with the idea that they should give something for the benefit of the poor from whom they have taken so much.
('65', 224, 2, 13, 403666) In this way I plunder the rich [yet] some people say that I am an agent of the rich.
('65', 224, 2, 14, 403751) I am no more than a labourer.
('65', 224, 2, 15, 403781) I have laboured with the labourers.
('65', 224, 2, 16, 403817) I have lived with them.
('65', 224, 2, 17, 403841) I have shared food with them.
('65', 224, 2, 18, 403871) I claim to be a representative of the working class for whom I obtain help from the rich.
('65', 224, 2, 19, 403961) I do not wish to make our 350 million countrymen slaves of the machine.
('65', 224, 2, 20, 404033) I see no socialism in it.
('65', 224, 2, 21, 404059) My concept of socialism implies that people should be self reliant.
('65', 224, 2, 22, 404127) That is the only way they can be prevented from being exploited.
('65', 224, 2, 23, 404192) I have been trying to persuade the workers that if the capitalists have their gold and silver, we have our hands and feet.
('65', 224, 2, 24, 404315) These too are assets.
('65', 224, 2, 25, 404337) A capitalist will never be able to carry on without labour.
('65', 224, 2, 26, 404397) Let no one misunderstand that the Sangh is going to serve the purpose of the capitalists, thereby making the workers slaves.
('65', 224, 2, 27, 404522) On the contrary it proposes to release them from slavery, by making them self reliant.
('65', 224, 2, 28, 404609) How can this involve enslaving?
('65', 224, 2, 29, 404641) I have given deep thought to the whole scheme before putting it before you.
('65', 224, 2, 30, 404717) This is the

('65', 224, 3, 32, 404805) 2 Govind Sahai was ‘opposed to the principle underlying the resolution” “not because he grudged seven crores of rupees being distributed among the villagers”, but because, according to him, real economic freedom for the masses of India could be attained only when they were educated and taught how they were being exploited.
('65', 224, 3, 33, 405130) He appealed to Gandhiji to change his methods and programme.

('65', 225, 2, 3, 405321) Whatever the fiscal policy of the Government was, nobody could stop the villagers becoming economically independent by developing village industries.
('65', 225, 2, 4, 405471) Many Congressmen like Mr. Mathuraprasad were asking what they should do after the election campaign was over.
('65', 225, 2, 5, 405581) Gandhiji said that there was the All India Spinners’ Association and the All India Village Industries Association where both Dr. Sanyal and Mr. Muthey could work.

('65', 225, 4, 8, 405847) UNPOLISHED
('65', 225, 5, 9, 405858) In my writing 3 on cent per cent swadeshi, I have shown how some aspects of it can be tackled immediately with benefit to the starving millions both economically and hygienically.
('65', 225, 5, 10, 406038) The richest in the land can share the benefit.
('65', 225, 5, 11, 406085) Thus if rice can be pounded in the villages after the old fashion, the wages will fill the pockets of the rice pounding sisters and the rice eating millions will get some sustenance from the unpolished rice instead of pure starch which the polished rice provides.
('65', 225, 5, 12, 406349) Human greed, which takes no count of the health or the wealth of the people who come under its heels, is responsible for the hideous rice mills one sees in all the rice producing tracts.
('65', 225, 5, 13, 406536) If public opinion was strong, it would make rice mills an impossibility by simply insisting on unpolished rice and appealing to the owners of rice mills to stop a traffic that undermines the health of a whole nation and robs the poor people of an honest means of livelihood.
('65', 225, 5, 14, 406811) But who will listen to the testimony of a mere layman on the question of food values?
('65', 225, 5, 15, 406897) I, therefore, give below an extract 4 from The Newer Knowledge of Nutrition by Mr. Collum and Simmonds which a medical friend, to whom I had appealed for help, has sent with his approbation.

('65', 226, 1, 2, 407345) 275. ‘NOT TO COW BUT TO SCORN?’
('65', 226, 2, 3, 407377) A young Englishman who has lived in Madras for two years writes from his home in Essex: 1
('65', 226, 3, 4, 407467) I believe that, of the Hindu population, untouchables are in the majority.
('65', 226, 3, 5, 407542) Of course I may be wrong but if correct, then, I consider the most effective measure to adopt in righting and preventing the grievous humiliations put upon this great body of people is not to approach the perpetrators (high castes) but the development of a ‘line of defiance’ through the untouchables themselves.
('65', 226, 4, 6, 407855) The forming of a Brotherhood amongst themselves that will encourage the development of an existence, entirely independent of those to whom they appear to be objectionable, should, by degrees, build up a “strong point” and cause these now humbled folk not to cow, but to scorn and ignore the spurning and lashes now directed at them.
('65', 226, 5, 7, 408188) The writer evidently does not know that there is a cult among Harijans which is trying to do exactly what he advises me to do.
('65', 226, 5, 8, 408315) But that way does not lie the salvation of Harijans, certainly not of caste Hindus.
('65', 226, 5, 9, 408399) The logical result of what is preached by the correspondent must be another problem akin to the Hindu Muslim one, only much more intense.
('65', 226, 5, 10, 408537) That way is the way of hate which is violence.
('65', 226, 5, 11, 408584) The way I am trying to follow is the way of love which is non violence.
('65', 226, 5, 12, 408656) Having belonged to the oppressor class and having by choice made the attempt to become one with the oppressed, I have learnt that the true way of securing justice is to inculcate mutual respect, in other words, to evoke the spirit of equality or brotherhood in the place of that of superiority and inferiority.
('65', 226, 5, 13, 408967) This can best be done by the ‘superior’ class being induced to descend from its fancied height.
('65', 226, 5, 14, 409063) The so called ‘inferior, class has to be taught, not to scorn, but to be induced to shed the fear that is born of a consciousness of inferiority.
('65', 226, 5, 15, 409209) Therefore the Harijan Sevak Sangh is performing the double duty of asking the caste Hindus, on the one hand, to repent of the injustice that they have done to the Harijans and is working, on the other hand, among the Harijans by spreading education among them and by bringing to their notice the evils that oppression always breeds

('65', 227, 1, 2, 409620) among the oppressed.
('65', 227, 1, 3, 409641) To deprive a man of his natural liberty and to deny to him the ordinary amenities of life is worse than starving the body.
('65', 227, 1, 4, 409764) It is starvation of the soul—the dweller in the body.
('65', 227, 1, 5, 409818) Harijans are a powerful illustration of this process of starvation of the soul.
('65', 227, 1, 6, 409898) No amount of mere literary education or even economic betterment will restore the lost dignity of man.
('65', 227, 1, 7, 410001) That restoration can only come when self realization comes.
('65', 227, 1, 8, 410061) This realization will not come without repentance on the part of the superior class.
('65', 227, 1, 9, 410146) Superiority complex and inferiority complex are two faces of the same coin.
('65', 227, 1, 10, 410222) Both are equally bad.
('65', 227, 1, 11, 410244) Both require treatment.
('65', 227, 1, 12, 410268) Mere transference of scorn from the ‘superior’ caste Hindu to the ‘inferior’ Harijan does not remedy the disease, it only aggravates it.
('65', 227, 1, 13, 410405) ‘Not to cow’ is sound advice.
('65', 227, 1, 14, 410435) But ‘to scorn’ is as bad as cowing.
('65', 227, 1, 15, 410471) ‘Love one another’ is, therefore, the only advice an impartial observer can give.
('65', 227, 1, 16, 410553) And I hope that the writer of the letter sees the weakness of the formula.

('65', 227, 4, 19, 410700) October 26, 1934
('65', 227, 5, 20, 410717) You have in your affection misread the whole of my position.
('65', 227, 6, 21, 410778) If you have given me the position of a general commanding an army, you must allow that general to judge whether he serves the army by being at its head or whether he serves the army by retiring and giving place to lieutenants who have served well.
('65', 227, 6, 22, 411026) It is always the wisest thing for the general to swing to power or office or withhold that power that came to him unsought, because there are occasions when generals have been found to consider themselves unequal to hold the reins, and in the interests of the army, the interests of the cause for which the army and its chief are fighting to give up the command.
('65', 227, 6, 23, 411389) If you believe that I have been a fairly wise general, you must believe in my judgment even now when I seem to be deserting you in the hour of your defeat.
('65', 227, 7, 24, 411545) 1 Earlier the Subjects Committee had unanimously passed a resolution expressing the country’s confidence in Gandhiji and requesting him to revise his decision to retire

('65', 228, 1, 2, 411763) I have said times without number that I myself share no feeling of defeat.
('65', 228, 1, 3, 411838) I am not deserting the cause for which I live, and for which I love to work.
('65', 228, 1, 4, 411915) I go away from you in order, as I have said, to discover if there is still greater possibilities in experiments that we have been making, and for which you have given me such a generous support.
('65', 228, 1, 5, 412110) I must express to you that I seem to have come to the end of my resources.
('65', 228, 1, 6, 412185) I must confess to you that I have not lost faith in the efficacy of the means that I placed at the disposal of the Congress.
('65', 228, 1, 7, 412310) But I feel there is a body of opinion rising in the country which has begun to question the efficacy of this means, and it is because they question the efficacy of this means that they have the sense of defeat in them.
('65', 228, 1, 8, 412529) In the dictionary of A satyagrahi, there is no such thing as defeat.
('65', 228, 1, 9, 412598) To him, the very pursuit of his battle is its own reward.
('65', 228, 1, 10, 412656) 1 But when I find some of my best companions, who have believed in truthfulness and non violence with all its implications, are filled with doubt and feeling of helplessness, when I find that I am not able to touch them with my faith, I see all around me an impenetrable darkness.
('65', 228, 1, 11, 412937) I see no ray of light.
('65', 228, 1, 12, 412960) I see I cannot infect them with the faith that is in me.
('65', 228, 2, 13, 413017) Therefore I would like you not to take me literally when I say that I go, if I can get your blessing.
('65', 228, 2, 14, 413119) I go with your blessing in search of greater power to discover means whereby I can give you the faith that is in me.
('65', 228, 2, 15, 413236) It may be that the search will be in vain.
('65', 228, 2, 16, 413279) It may be that my roaming in solitude will be in vain.
('65', 228, 2, 17, 413334) But depend upon it that I shall not wait a moment longer to be called by you, when I feel the necessity.
('65', 228, 2, 18, 413439) I shall come to you, and once more come to the Congress to register myself as a primary member, and do whatever I can in the interests of the Congress.
('65', 228, 2, 19, 413591) I ask you therefore not to feel dispirited, but to feel that you will be able to discharge your duty, that you will have leaders enough to lead you on to victory.
('65', 228, 2, 20, 413754) When it becomes necessary for me to come to this House, I will be entirely at your disposal.
('65', 228, 2, 21, 413847) Therefore, I would simply urge not to press the resolution further.
('65', 228, 2, 22, 413915) You have unanimously passed that resolution.
('65', 228, 2, 23, 413960) Let that be enough.
('65', 228, 2, 24, 413980) Somehow or other I
('65', 228, 3, 25, 413999) 1 A report in The Bombay Chronicle, 27 10 1934, here has: The very pursuit of truth is its own victory.
('65', 228, 3, 26, 414103) 2 The Bombay Chronicle here has: I have abundant faith in my programme.
('65', 228, 3, 27, 414175) In the apparent darkness that envelops us, I see millions of rays of light, but.
('65', 228, 3, 28, 414256) I cannot show you that light.
('65', 229, 0, 1, 414286) 230 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 229, 1, 2, 414328) believe good, and only good, will come out of this decision.
('65', 229, 1, 3, 414389) If you yourselves stand for the principle for which I stand, and for which you have given allegiance, which I acknowledge you have given out of your generosity, some of you no doubt blindly, some of you after having considered for yourselves, I have in all humility accepted all these allegiances.
('65', 229, 1, 4, 414687) Let me now prove to myself, if it is possible, that I am worthy of it, and I invite you to prove it for yourselves also, whether I remain a member of the Congress or not, that the principle that you have more or less followed during all these long or short 14 or 15 years, you have followed because you have believed in it.
('65', 229, 1, 5, 415011) I tell you that it gives me still greater joy and pleasure, for I am able to say to myself, and if you are able to say to the world, that although I am gone you believe in the principle that you have fought for and lived for all these years and that you are going to follow them out not loosely, but still more truly and thoroughly than you have done before.
('65', 229, 2, 6, 415370) Immediately after his speech dealing with the question of his retirement Gandhiji proceeded to move formally a comprehensive resolution incorporating all the recommendations of the constitution sub committee and the Congress Working Committee.
('65', 229, 2, 7, 415614) In commending the whole of the resolution for the acceptance of the House in toto, Gandhiji at the outset referred to the previous day’s decision of the House turning down the Working Committee’s recommendation relating to the change of the Congress creed.
('65', 229, 3, 8, 415871) Mahatma Gandhi delivered a stirring address lasting 90 minutes in which he appealed to the Subjects Committee to adopt the revised constitution.
('65', 229, 4, 9, 416016) Mahatma Gandhi referred to Thursday’s vote and congratulated the House on the frank way in which they had voted in referring the question of change of creed to provincial committees.
('65', 229, 4, 10, 416199) He said, when he had read the public and Press criticism of his proposals, he had made up his mind not to take up those amendments, but members of the Working Committee had of their own accord unanimously taken the view that the Committee would sponsor those resolutions.
('65', 229, 4, 11, 416471) Gandhiji added:
('65', 229, 5, 12, 416487) I was surprised to find that members of the Committee devoted two hours this morning to deliberating as to what was their duty in
('65', 229, 6, 13, 416617) 1 The Bombay Chronicle here has: In moving the amendments to the Congress constitution as adumbrated in his Press statements, Gandhiji congratulated the House on its frankness in rejecting the Working Committee’s proposal to substitute ‘truthful’ and ‘non violent’ in place of ‘peaceful and legitimate’ “But I cannot say that you acted wisely,” he added.
('65', 230, 0, 1, 416972) VOL.65: 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 231
('65', 230, 1, 2, 417021) connection with these amendments.
('65', 230, 1, 3, 417055) I told the Working Committee to carry out your resolution, but my feeling is that Mr. Sidhwa’s amendment was wholly unnecessary.
('65', 230, 1, 4, 417184) You could have rejected the Working Committee’s proposal, but there was no use circulating it.
('65', 230, 1, 5, 417279) I listened carefully to Mr. Patwardhan’s speech.
('65', 230, 1, 6, 417328) He argued ably, but either he was deceiving himself or he was acting simply as an advocate.
('65', 230, 1, 7, 417420) He said that we had descended from ideals to realism.
('65', 230, 1, 8, 417474) But has not socialism its ideals and if I told him to remove even a comma from their ideals he would reject my proposition.
('65', 230, 1, 9, 417598) Do you suppose you will realize complete independence at any time even after fifty generations?
('65', 230, 1, 10, 417694) The socialist creed goes even further.
('65', 230, 1, 11, 417733) I suggest we must have a measuring rod.
('65', 230, 1, 12, 417773) The day humanity ceases to believe in ideals, it will descend to the level of the beasts.
('65', 230, 1, 13, 417863) Today if you believe in truthfulness and non violence say so.
('65', 230, 1, 14, 417925) It does not mean you will be cent per cent truthful.
('65', 230, 1, 15, 417978) I am not cent per cent truthful.
('65', 230, 2, 16, 418011) If I were, my words will pierce you like arrows and come out clean, but I must aspire to attain my ideals.
('65', 230, 2, 17, 418118) 2 Did Marx live to see his ideal realized?
('65', 230, 2, 18, 418161) Is it not undergoing changes and are not meanings put to it which Marx himself never dreamt of?
('65', 230, 2, 19, 418257) If you do not mean by “legitimate and peaceful” means that they are “truthful and non violent”, then merely define your creed to be that of attaining your end by whatever means you think legitimate.
('65', 230, 2, 20, 418456) Then that would be your measuring rod, but you must have a measuring rod.
('65', 230, 2, 21, 418530) You must be clear about your aims and means.
('65', 230, 2, 22, 418575) They are convertible terms.
('65', 230, 2, 23, 418603) You know that swaraj is your goal.
('65', 230, 2, 24, 418638) It means “purna swaraj” but someone said it did not mean complete independence; so we defined it to mean “purna swaraj”.
('65', 230, 2, 25, 418759) Just as you did that you must define your creed so that it may not be open to double interpretation.
('65', 230, 2, 26, 418860) No one can draw a right angle, yet Euclid drew it up in imagination and gave the engineers a measuring rod by which the world has progressed.
('65', 230, 2, 27, 419002) There is a right angle which is treasured in the Tower of London.
('65', 230, 2, 28, 419068) The Working Committee on Friday asked you to define your measuring rod.
('65', 230, 2, 29, 419140) You sent it round for circulation.
('65', 230, 2, 30, 419175) That was not the
('65', 230, 3, 31, 419192) 1 The Bombay Chronicle here has: I have never dared to make such a claim.
('65', 230, 3, 32, 419266) 2 The Bombay Chronicle here has: If I was cent per cent truthful, every word of mine would pierce you like an arrow and emerge uncontaminated and fill you with truth, but I aspire to be cent percent truthful.
('65', 230, 3, 33, 419475) If humanity were to give up its ideals, it would descend to the level of beasts.
('65', 230, 3, 34, 419556) Ideals we must have and ideals always recede.
('65', 231, 0, 1, 419602) 232 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 231, 1, 2, 419644) right course to take.
('65', 231, 1, 3, 419666) Let us not tell the world that there is one thing on our lips and another in our thoughts.
('65', 231, 2, 4, 419757) Mahatma Gandhi next explained the main purpose of the amendments proposed in the constitution.
('65', 231, 2, 5, 419852) He said: Do not pass these changes buoyed up with the hope that I will reconsider my decision.
('65', 231, 2, 6, 419947) If I began my unofficial leadership of the Congress by the constitution for which I was primarily responsible I am also tendering you a humble gift in the shape of this amended constitution so that you may get the benefit of the judgment and experience of one who has endeavoured to live that constitution in closest communication and communion with you and has discovered its faults.
('65', 231, 2, 7, 420332) I want you, therefore, to pass these amendments after touching them up.
('65', 231, 2, 8, 420404) You can take a day for consideration after hearing me and do whatever lobbying you like and give your verdict.
('65', 231, 2, 9, 420515) You must first make up your mind to reduce your delegates from 6,000 to 1,000. If you reject that, the entire scheme falls through.
('65', 231, 2, 10, 420647) The second point is that the delegates should be real representatives of the people.
('65', 231, 2, 11, 420732) We are indirectly representative of the nation’s dumb millions.
('65', 231, 2, 12, 420796) We are their mouthpiece, their voice and their thought.
('65', 231, 2, 13, 420852) That is what the Congress has stood for since 1885, but indirectly we are representatives only of our electors.
('65', 231, 2, 14, 420964) Can anyone among us say whom he represents, as to whether he is in living touch with his constituents and knows their feelings?
('65', 231, 2, 15, 421092) Even the tallest amongst us cannot claim that.
('65', 231, 2, 16, 421139) Sardar Vallabhbhai is the uncrowned king of Gujarat, but which electorate does he represent, whom do I represent, I do not know.
('65', 231, 2, 17, 421268) I challenge anyone to produce the Congress register of electors.
('65', 231, 2, 18, 421333) We must have constituencies and electors and each member shall represent his constituency and be in living touch with it.
('65', 231, 2, 19, 421455) Then alone you will have your measuring rod.
('65', 231, 2, 20, 421500) The third principle I have put forward is that three things be combined in one election.
('65', 231, 2, 21, 421589) It will not merely mean greater convenience and saving of money, it is rich with promise if you adopt it.
('65', 231, 2, 22, 421695) Delegates will then be elected by their electorate.
('65', 231, 2, 23, 421747) They will not assemble as now for three days in a year and then disappear from the horizon.
('65', 231, 2, 24, 421839) They will remain active Congressmen as members of the A. I. C. C. and will take up work all the year round.
('65', 231, 2, 25, 421947) Today only 350 out of 1,530 are members of the A. I. C. C. Then again a body of 1 ,000 can be accommodated in Sardar

('65', 232, 1, 3, 422143) I have got a complete scheme ready for a successful session being held in the village of that character.
('65', 232, 1, 4, 422248) Those villages can slave for you but they cannot give you money for your Reception Committee.
('65', 232, 1, 5, 422342) You must have people who know the business of running a Congress meeting and even importing provisions and the Reception Committee shall not waste lakhs on its arrangements.
('65', 232, 1, 6, 422516) I question the wisdom of the Reception Committee wasting lakhs on tamashas and in building triumphal arches.
('65', 232, 1, 7, 422625) Where is our triumph?
('65', 232, 1, 8, 422647) We are a slave nation and all we want the Reception Committee to do is to give us the hospitality, not of pudding and ice cream, but ordinary food.
('65', 232, 1, 9, 422795) Our scheme is to relieve the Reception Committees of their heavy burden.
('65', 232, 1, 10, 422868) If I had been in Nariman’s position I would have become a lunatic.
('65', 232, 2, 11, 422935) Mahatma Gandhi, reverting to his plea that the matter be not referred to Provincial Committees, said:
('65', 232, 3, 12, 423037) Why do you want to refer it to the provinces?
('65', 232, 3, 13, 423083) Why shirk your duty?
('65', 232, 3, 14, 423104) You are super delegates because you are the Subjects Committee.
('65', 232, 3, 15, 423168) Others are mere delegates, but mere delegates representing 350 millions.
('65', 232, 3, 16, 423241) Then I say it is for them to hammer out a constitution and not shirk the duty.
('65', 232, 3, 17, 423320) I promise you fair consideration of every criticism you have made.
('65', 232, 3, 18, 423387) I am giving you an iron constitution from which not one single man can go away.
('65', 232, 3, 19, 423467) If there is any corruption you can detect it unless everyone becomes a fraud.
('65', 232, 3, 20, 423545) No constitution can be robber proof and thief proof.
('65', 232, 3, 21, 423598) I have sufficient faith in my countrymen that they will never betray their country.
('65', 232, 3, 22, 423682) Sri Prakasa says our present constitution is rotten.
('65', 232, 3, 23, 423735) Then are we to waste another year in waiting for what we shall do?
('65', 232, 3, 24, 423802) I am sure that the position will remain where it is and we will not receive a single report during the next twelve months.
('65', 232, 3, 25, 423925) Make such use as you can of the wisdom you say is possessed by me whom the world holds as a fool.
('65', 232, 3, 26, 424023) But wisdom sometimes does come out of the mouth of fools.
('65', 232, 3, 27, 424081) I would like you to accept my suggestions and I will be ready for compromise.
('65', 232, 3, 28, 424159) Already, when Mr. Masani came to me, I assured him that I wanted Socialists to be represented.
('65', 232, 3, 29, 424254) They are the advance wing.
('65', 232, 3, 30, 424281) There is nothing to be feared from their activity.
('65', 232, 3, 31, 424332) They call themselves Congressmen and while they are Congressmen they are supposed to believe in the Congress creed and loyally follow the discipline of the Congress.
('65', 232, 3, 32, 424498) If they fail to follow the Congress discipline, they will fail in their own creed.
('65', 232, 3, 33, 424581) I have agreed to their suggestion regarding the single
('65', 233, 0, 1, 424636) 234 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 233, 1, 2, 424678) transferable vote.
('65', 233, 1, 3, 424697) This constitution has been revised by able lawyers like Mr. Bhulabhai Desai and Mr. K. M. Munshi and many others have been consulted.
('65', 233, 1, 4, 424831) I may also make it clear that there will be plural constituencies in urban areas, but their number is not defined.
('65', 233, 1, 5, 424946) The Working Committee is entirely in your hands in these matters of detail, but do not postpone these matters.
('65', 233, 1, 6, 425057) You are going to have a Parliamentary Board.
('65', 233, 1, 7, 425102) They will look after the Assembly work.
('65', 233, 1, 8, 425142) In the Assembly it is not a battle between men, but between principles; our members will go to represent the principles which will not require eloquence, but will be enunciated in unequivocal terms.
('65', 233, 1, 9, 425341) Hereafter you will have your register of electors and you will be in living touch with them.
('65', 233, 1, 10, 425434) Mr. Nageshwara Rao says that there are 7,000 voters for one seat.
('65', 233, 1, 11, 425500) My scheme is modest.
('65', 233, 1, 12, 425521) It wants only 1,000 voters for one seat.
('65', 233, 1, 13, 425562) I will be satisfied if you are the representatives of one million and then we can have more and more.
('65', 233, 1, 14, 425664) But I do submit that we will lose one precious year in the life of the nation by referring these matters to Provincial Committees.
('65', 233, 2, 15, 425795) Proceeding, Mahatma Gandhi referred to the amendments seeking to incorporate the existing convention of allowing the President to select his colleagues of the Working Committee in the Congress constitution.
('65', 233, 2, 16, 426002) Gandhiji said that there had been no single instance in the past wherein the President’s choice in this matter had been overridden by the A. I. C. C. But he thought it would be better to incorporate this convention in the constitution so as to avoid difficulties attendant on selection of candidates.
('65', 233, 2, 17, 426303) The President under this amendment would not have to stand the fire of cross examination at the A.I.C.C.
('65', 233, 3, 18, 426408) There must be some occasions in the life of the Working Committee when they would have to say: “If you want us to carry on then we ask you to arm us with certain powers and if you cannot trust us then you must look for better men to.
('65', 233, 3, 19, 426642) fill our place.” For the same reason he had sought that the Secretaries and the Treasurer should also be the President’s choice.

('65', 234, 2, 3, 427075) October 27, 1934
('65', 234, 3, 4, 427092) When the Subjects Committee met on the morning of the 27th Mr. Gandhi continued his speech on his amendments to the Congress constitution.
('65', 234, 3, 5, 427231) He said that when they discovered so many breaches in the walls of their house, they should fill them in quickly.
('65', 234, 3, 6, 427345) There was nothing in the new constitution requiring study or reference to outside authority.
('65', 234, 3, 7, 427438) If they wanted to circulate it, he would take it to mean that they did not want it.
('65', 234, 3, 8, 427522) If they were not convinced about the absolute necessity of passing the constitution, he would beseech them to reject it.
('65', 234, 3, 9, 427643) Referring to the question of reducing the strength of the Provincial Congress Committees, he said that he had had bitter experience of unwieldly bodies losing sight of the work before them.
('65', 234, 3, 10, 427833) That was why he was desperately in earnest about it.
('65', 234, 3, 11, 427886) I he essence of democracy did not lie in numerical strength but the spirit behind even one person.
('65', 234, 3, 12, 427985) Even one man could represent a whole democracy.
('65', 234, 3, 13, 428033) In England, he said, it was not the House of Commons but it was the Bank of England that dictated policies to the British Ministers.
('65', 234, 3, 14, 428166) Recently the Bank had finished its business in the record time of 13_ minutes.
('65', 234, 3, 15, 428245) If the Bank could manage such huge affairs in 13_ minutes, the Congress should be able to manage its affairs in five minutes.
('65', 234, 3, 16, 428371) Mr. Gandhi then moved that the Subjects Committee should accept the principle underlying the new constitution and appoint a sub committee to consider the constitution and place their recommendations before the Subjects Committee by 8 a.m.
('65', 234, 3, 17, 428610) on the 28th.
('65', 234, 4, 18, 428623) Replying to the debate, Mr. Gandhi said he had been asked whether he would reconsider his decision if the Committee accepted his amendments without changing a comma.
('65', 234, 4, 19, 428789) He assured them that there was no “danger” of his remaining in the Congress in any event.
('65', 234, 4, 20, 428879) He asked them to accept the new constitution only if they had confidence in it.

('65', 235, 2, 3, 429550) BOMBAY, October 28, 1934
('65', 235, 3, 4, 429575) Since Sjt.
('65', 235, 3, 5, 429586) Shoorji Vallabhdas started this Swadeshi Bazaar, it has attracted my attention and I had promised that I would visit the stores at the earliest opportunity.
('65', 235, 3, 6, 429743) That happy opportunity has been postponed due to various reasons up to this day, and even today I have had to snatch some time from my other engagements to fulfil my promise and as I have to return soon, unfortunately, I will not be able to give you much of my time.
('65', 235, 3, 7, 430010) I have repeated very often that as long as the charkha does not hum in every village, we will not be able to attain swaraj nor will we be able to safeguard religion.
('65', 235, 3, 8, 430176) Before our very eyes crores of our own brothers and sisters are not getting sufficient meals even once a day, while we enjoy two square meals.
('65', 235, 3, 9, 430319) These crores are starving not because they do not wish to work, but because they do not find work.
('65', 235, 3, 10, 430418) If you would place the charkha in their hands or if you can find out any other work for them superior to the charkha you may give that first and then the charkha.
('65', 235, 3, 11, 430581) But do give these starving millions some work and then alone you will be able to bring food for their famished bodies.
('65', 235, 3, 12, 430700) Suppose you set the charkhas going, what about the khadi that will be manufactured?
('65', 235, 3, 13, 430784) You all want to put on cheap and good looking clothes in preference to khaddar, then in what way can you be of help to these poor starving people?
('65', 235, 3, 14, 430931) Even if khaddar be costly it is your and my duty to use it.
('65', 235, 3, 15, 430991) In our country millions upon millions have not even the bare loin cloth to hide their shame, how can you expect them to put on khaddar?
('65', 235, 3, 16, 431127) It would interest you to know that within ten years two and a quarter crores of rupees have been distributed as wages amongst the spinners.
('65', 235, 3, 17, 431267) This sum has gone direct into the hands of the poor.
('65', 235, 3, 18, 431320) By putting on khaddar you can help these people.
('65', 235, 3, 19, 431369) But to my utter regret I find that in Bombay many of you—both men and women—do not put on khaddar.
('65', 235, 3, 20, 431468) If you do not wish to put on khaddar, where is the sense in being present at meetings which are addressed by me?
('65', 235, 3, 21, 431581) I have come here with the hope that you would cast

('65', 236, 1, 3, 431846) I am confident that all the other articles also that are being sold in this Bazaar are completely made in India.
('65', 236, 1, 4, 431959) Today, I have not been able to go into the details of all the articles that are exhibited here, but on a future occasion I mean to interest myself in details with regard to each and every article to be found here.
('65', 236, 1, 5, 432173) That this Bazaar is not making profit has been realized by you and yet whenever it makes profits they will be ours.
('65', 236, 1, 6, 432289) I would, therefore, urge upon you that whenever you wish to purchase any article please make it a point to visit this Bazaar.

('65', 236, 4, 9, 432502) October 28, 1934
('65', 236, 5, 10, 432519) Mahatma Gandhi formally moving for the acceptance of the report stated that the sub committee met on Saturday from 2 to 9 p.m.
('65', 236, 5, 11, 432646) and had prepared their report.
('65', 236, 5, 12, 432677) He himself sat up till I a.m.
('65', 236, 5, 13, 432707) and Mr. Kishorelal sat up the whole night drafting the report.
('65', 236, 5, 14, 432770) After Kishorelal had drafted the report, Messrs Munshi and Bhulabhai Desai sat over it and gave the legal touches to it.
('65', 236, 5, 15, 432891) The speaker said that he did not want anything to be hurried, so that they might not think of an aftermath change which would have to be incorporated into the report.
('65', 236, 5, 16, 433058) The members of the sub committee sat with the determination of bringing out a unanimous report and considered all the recommendations of the Working Committee.
('65', 236, 6, 17, 433218) Mahatma Gandhi explained the changes that had been made in the constitution.
('65', 236, 6, 18, 433295) It had been suggested several times that the name of the United Provinces should be changed to Hind and the name of C. P. (Hindi) as Mahakoshal.
('65', 236, 6, 19, 433440) The speaker had not the courage himself to suggest the change, but since some of the members of the sub committee suggested the change, he accepted it.
('65', 236, 7, 20, 433592) The Committee also had made a slight verbal change in Article V of the constitution.
('65', 236, 7, 21, 433677) In that Article, the word “officer” had been restored.
('65', 236, 7, 22, 433732) Another important clause which had been added at the suggestion of some of the members, whose point the speaker appreciated very much, was regarding no member of the Congress being a member of any communal or anti national organization.
('65', 236, 7, 23, 433969) There was some reluctance
('65', 236, 8, 24, 433995) 1 At this stage the loudspeakers failed.
('65', 236, 8, 25, 434036) Gandhiji continued after the current was restored.
('65', 237, 0, 1, 434087) 238 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 237, 1, 2, 434129) on the part of some of the members to introduce this clause, but the opposition was borne down and.
('65', 237, 1, 3, 434229) the clause was accepted.
('65', 237, 2, 4, 434254) Then, regarding the reduction in the Congress delegation, the original proposition wanted that there should be only l,000 delegates and they themselves form the All India Congress Committee, but it had been suggested by some of the members that the number of delegates should be 2,000, each delegate [representing] 500 Congressmen instead of 1 ,000 as suggested originally.
('65', 237, 2, 5, 434628) The delegates from the urban constituencies shall in no case be more than 511, while the rural delegation should not be more than 1,489.
('65', 237, 3, 6, 434765) For the benefit of many minorities, it had been suggested that there should be multiple constituencies, each constituency consisting of at least five members.
('65', 237, 3, 7, 434924) The election should take place under the single transferable vote system.
('65', 237, 3, 8, 434998) This was an intricate subject to understand, said Candhiji, but the system would make it physically impossible to have a constituency of less than five members.
('65', 237, 4, 9, 435159) Gandhiji explained in detail the system of’ the single transferable vote and multiple constituency.
('65', 237, 4, 10, 435259) The idea was to make the position of the minorities secure.
('65', 237, 5, 11, 435319) Gandhiji continuing said that he would like the House to discuss it without loss of time and accept it as a whole even though the acceptance might be done reluctantly.
('65', 237, 5, 12, 435487) There could be little ado or difficulty for the Committee to accept the report, which had amended the amendments.
('65', 237, 5, 13, 435601) The number of delegates allotted to the provinces looked ugly, though it did not read ugly.
('65', 237, 5, 14, 435693) Bombay had been given the right to send in 21 delegates.
('65', 237, 5, 15, 435750) This was in recognition of the importance of the city and the part it had taken in the political fight.
('65', 237, 5, 16, 435854) Including the All India Congress Committee members today, Bombay was sending 30 delegates to the Congress and that number had been reduced to 21. This was not according to the population system.
('65', 237, 5, 17, 436049) Bombay had been a veritable gold mine for developing the political conscience of the country.
('65', 237, 5, 18, 436143) It was only on Bombay that this rare honour had been conferred.
('65', 237, 5, 19, 436207) According to the system laid down under the constitution , Bombay would be entitled to send in only six delegates.
('65', 237, 6, 20, 436322) Continuing, Gandhiji said that the A. I. C. C. would consist of 166 members as suggested by the sub committee instead of the present 350. This was in the proportion of one A. I. C. C. member for every twelve delegates.
('65', 237, 6, 21, 436541) This would be nearly half of the present number.
('65', 237, 6, 22, 436590) According to Gandhiji, it was not a bad change.
('65', 237, 6, 23, 436638) The A. I. C. C. became a still more business like and responsible body.
('65', 237, 6, 24, 436710) Instead of the suggested A. I. C. C. of l,000 members, the A. I. C. C. had been reduced to 166.
('65', 237, 7, 25, 436806) This has been done at the suggestion of many friends on the Committee who wanted that there should be an intermediary body between the Congress and the Working Committee.
('65', 237, 7, 26, 436977) It has also been
('65', 238, 0, 1, 436994) VOL.65: 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 239
('65', 238, 1, 2, 437043) laid down that no person can get into the A. I. C. C. from any other province than his own.
('65', 238, 1, 3, 437135) If a province does not produce the requisite number of members on the All India Congress Committee or of Congress delegates, then that province goes only with that number and nothing more.
('65', 238, 1, 4, 437324) Each province will send at least ten delegates to the Congress.
('65', 238, 2, 5, 437388) The new changes had not been thrust on the speaker.
('65', 238, 3, 6, 437440) Then Gandhiji referred to the election of the President.
('65', 238, 3, 7, 437497) He said that since Nagpur he did not like the idea, and it had been decided by the sub committee that the President should be elected by the delegates of the provinces who would send in their recommendations to the Working Committee who, after receiving all the recommendations, would declare the President of the year.
('65', 238, 3, 8, 437817) The present system of the Reception Committee electing the President was not understandable.
('65', 238, 3, 9, 437910) What had the Reception Committee to do with the President of the Congress, while the delegates with whom the President had to confer and decide the future work of the Congress were imposed with a President about whose selection they had nothing to do.
('65', 238, 4, 10, 438162) This sort of anachronism ought to go and that is why the sub committee has decided that the delegates from the provinces should elect their President.
('65', 238, 4, 11, 438313) The same meeting of the Provincial Congress Committee will elect their nominees on the All India Congress Committee.
('65', 238, 4, 12, 438430) The P. C. C. will elect their quota of delegates less the number of the A. I. C. C. members who ipso facto become delegates also.
('65', 238, 4, 13, 438560) The work of the P. C. C. will be to carry out the programme and policy laid down by the Congress.
('65', 238, 5, 14, 438658) Gandhiji also discussed the powers of the Working Committee and stated that it was for the Working Committee to carry out the policy and programme enunciated by the Congress.
('65', 238, 5, 15, 438833) But it was the work of the Working Committee to interpret the decisions of the Congress.
('65', 238, 5, 16, 438922) The instance of the resolution 1 on the Communal Award
('65', 238, 6, 17, 438977) and the Congress attitude towards it was one of the extreme cases when the Working Committee expressed the views of the Congress.
('65', 238, 6, 18, 439107) The Working Committee would be watchdog of the Congress in the country with the right of interpreting, whenever occasion arose, the decisions of the Congress.
('65', 238, 6, 19, 439266) The Working Committee was not a body of dummies.
('65', 238, 6, 20, 439315) It was for the All India Congress Committee to place complete trust in the Working Committee, with amplest discriminatory powers within its jurisdiction.
('65', 238, 6, 21, 439469) It was for the Working Committee to guide the policy laid down by the
('65', 238, 7, 22, 439539) 1 Passed at Bombay on June 17 and 18
('65', 239, 0, 1, 439576) 240 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 239, 1, 2, 439618) Congress and the A. I. C. C. Gandhiji said:
('65', 239, 2, 3, 439662) There are times when the Working Committee will have to take bold risks.
('65', 239, 2, 4, 439735) Since the last many years, they have been taking risks and not an occasion had arisen when the A. I. C. C. passed a vote of no confidence against the Working Committee.
('65', 239, 2, 5, 439904) No Working Committee will be worth its salt if it does not take risks.
('65', 239, 2, 6, 439975) The sub committee has recommended that no Provincial Congress Committee shall have more than 100 members and those who have already got more will reduce themselves, while those who have less shall remain so till the next elections.
('65', 239, 2, 7, 440207) It is necessary under the proposed constitutional changes that 15 signatures should be affixed, if the meeting of the A. I. C. C. has to be called while the quorum would be 25.
('65', 239, 3, 8, 440384) After explaining the fundamental changes that had been proposed in the constitution, Gandhiji asked the House to proceed with the discussion of the report.
('65', 239, 4, 9, 440540) Mahatma Gandhi submitted the following report to the Subjects Committee:
('65', 239, 5, 10, 440613) Pursuant to your yesterday’s resolution, we have considered the Working Committee’s recommendations for the amendment of the Congress constitution and beg to submit our draft as annexed herewith.
('65', 239, 5, 11, 440809) We are happy to state that we have been able to achieve complete unanimity.
('65', 239, 6, 12, 440885) The main alterations made by us in the Working Committee’s draft may be summarized as follows:
('65', 239, 7, 13, 440980) 1. In Article II instead of the words “subject to the previous approval of the Working Committee” we have substituted the words, “in accordance with the rules framed by it (as Provincial Congress Committee) in that behalf and approved by the Working Committee”.
('65', 239, 8, 14, 441242) 2. In Article III, we have made minor alterations; such as the change in the names of the provinces U. P. and C. P. (Hindustani) — into Hind and Mahakoshal respectively and the deletion of the last clause in C1. (c) which was superfluous.
('65', 239, 9, 15, 441481) 3. In Article IV we have incorporated the labour franchise passed by the Subjects Committee with a slight verbal change so as to bring it in harmony with the khadi clause.
('65', 239, 9, 16, 441653) We have also added a new and important clause to this Article as
('65', 240, 0, 1, 441718) VOL.65: 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 241
('65', 240, 1, 2, 441767) follows:
('65', 240, 2, 3, 441776) No person being a member of any elective Congress Committee shall be a member of any similar committee of a communal organization the object or programme of which involves political activities which are in the opinion of the Working Committee anti national and in conflict with those of the Congress.
('65', 240, 3, 4, 442077) 4. In Article V, we have changed the original scheme of delegates in the following manner:
('65', 240, 4, 5, 442168) (l) The number of delegates has been increased from l,000 to 2,000, each representing a constituency of not less than 500 instead of l,000 primary members.
('65', 240, 5, 6, 442324) (2) The urban area will be entitled to have not more than 511 delegates in the aggregate and the rural area not more than 1,489. No province shall have more than its proportion of delegates that would belong to it, if it was fixed on the population basis as heretofore and every province shall be entitled to not less than ten, even though the number of its primary members may be inadequate to send that number.
('65', 240, 6, 7, 442737) (3) The claims of the city of Bombay have been recognized by giving it a maximum of 21 delegates: for providing for this weightage we have been obliged to deprive the rural area of 11 delegates.
('65', 240, 7, 8, 442932) (4) Where the delegates of a province exceed 100, the Provincial Congress Committee shall consist of the All India Congress Committee members for that province plus those elected by the delegates to bring up the total to 100. Where the delegates are less than 100, the whole will constitute the Provincial Congress Committee.
('65', 240, 8, 9, 443258) (5) The President of the Congress is to be elected by the delegates for the ensuing session in the following manner.
('65', 240, 9, 10, 443375) Soon after the election of delegates they should meet under the Chairmanship of the President of the Provincial Congress Committee and elect the President, the Chairman registering the number of votes secured by each nominee, where there is more than one, and where there is only one nominee, he will be deemed to have received as
('65', 241, 0, 1, 443706) 242 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 241, 1, 2, 443748) many votes as there are delegates present at the meeting.
('65', 241, 1, 3, 443806) These elections will take place simultaneously on the date fixed by the Working Committee in that behalf.
('65', 241, 1, 4, 443912) These results shall be posted to the Working Committee by the Provincial Congress Committee and the nominee securing the highest number of votes shall be declared President for the ensuing year.
('65', 241, 1, 5, 444107) The same meeting of delegates shall elect its quota of members for the All India Congress Committee.
('65', 241, 2, 6, 444208) (6) The number of the members of the All India Congress Committee has been fixed at l66 as the .maximum, each province having one member to every twelve delegates and every province being entitled to at least one, though it may not have twelve delegates.
('65', 241, 2, 7, 444463) These members to be elected at the meeting of delegates referred to by the single transferable vote.
('65', 241, 2, 8, 444564) The same meeting of delegates to elect members of Provincial Congress Committees where necessary.
('65', 241, 3, 9, 444662) Regard being had to the fact that the All India Congress Committee has been considerably reduced, members desire to emphasize the necessity of making it clear in the constitution that the Working Committee should not initiate new policies but should merely be the executive body carrying out the policies laid down from time to time by the All India Congress Committee.
('65', 241, 4, 10, 445032) 5. The sub comrnittee recommends that at least one day should be invariably given for the consideration of proposals made by private members.
('65', 241, 5, 11, 445174) 6. The sub committee recommends the deletion of the Article dealing with matters affecting communal interests.
('65', 241, 6, 12, 445285) 7. During the transitory period, the Provincial Congress Committees are to elect by single transferable vote the reduced quota of members of the All India Congress Committee, the quota for the transitory period being the full strength of 166 distributed according to the existing proportions.
('65', 241, 7, 13, 445578) 8. The Provincial Congress Committees to reduce themselves to 100 where they number more than 100. These elections to take place before the 15th of January.
('65', 241, 8, 14, 445735) Mr. Mazumdar from Bengal asked if it was not a fact that members were being elected directly under the proposed constitution, while the previous constitution
('65', 242, 0, 1, 445893) VOL.65: 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 243
('65', 242, 1, 2, 445942) allowed indirect election.
('65', 242, 2, 3, 445969) Gandhiji agreed that it was so, but said that the new A. I. C. C. was not a subordinate body, it was less numerical than originally proposed by him.
('65', 242, 3, 4, 446118) Gandhiji appealed to the House not to move amendments, but make suggestion, which, if found feasible, he might accept.
('65', 242, 3, 5, 446237) But if the House wanted wrangling over the report, then amendments should be moved, and the President would regulate the discussion.
('65', 242, 4, 6, 446370) Mr. Babu Purushottamdas Tandon seconded the motion.
('65', 242, 5, 7, 446422) Mr. Sampurnanand asked Gandhiji if the members of the sub committee had freedom to vote on the question of Article I, at the open session, and Gandhiji informed him that they had.
('65', 242, 6, 8, 446602) Questioned regarding the elections in Bengal after the new constitution came into existence, Gandhiji said that the present P. C. C. would continue to function with the reduced number till the next elections.
('65', 242, 7, 9, 446811) Dr. Choithram Gidwani opposed the amendment regarding U. P. being called Hind, .
('65', 242, 7, 10, 446892) by Hind the whole of India was meant.
('65', 242, 8, 11, 446930) Sardar Sardulsingh seconded the amendment.
('65', 242, 9, 12, 446973) Mr. C. Rajagopalachari supported Dr. Choithram and said that if Hind was adopted as the name of U. P., then many changes would have to be made both in songs and national cries.
('65', 242, 10, 13, 447150) Mahatmaji, at this stage, stated that he accepted the suggestion because many people had complained that they had no name for U. P. at all.
('65', 242, 10, 14, 447290) But seeing that there were many who were opposed to it, he would withdraw it.
('65', 242, 10, 15, 447368) He was doing it without conferring with the members of the sub cornmittee.
('65', 242, 11, 16, 447443) On the members saying that they had no objection to calling C. P. (Hindi) Mahakoshal, Mahatmaji, amidst laughter, said:
('65', 242, 12, 17, 447563) You seem to grudge poor Jawaharlal who is inside the Naini Jail.
('65', 242, 12, 18, 447628) It was he who had suggested that U. P. should be called Hind.
('65', 242, 13, 19, 447690) Sardar Sardulsingh then moved an amendment that since Bombay had been given a weightage, the Frontier Province also should be given weightage, because they were more than entitled to it.
('65', 242, 14, 20, 447877) Mahatmaji said that he was opposed to weightage, and was prepared to cancel the number allotted to Bombay.
('65', 242, 15, 21, 447984) Gandhiji, replying to the several points, said that it was unfortunate that several amendments had been moved to the report.
('65', 242, 15, 22, 448109) He wanted the House to accept or reject the report as a whole, because the report was an organic whole, and could not be
('65', 243, 0, 1, 448230) 244 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 243, 1, 2, 448272) changed here and there.
('65', 243, 2, 3, 448296) The suggestion that the A. I. C. C. membership should remain at 350 made that body a very loose body.
('65', 243, 2, 4, 448398) It was the aim of the speaker to aim at quality and not at quantity.
('65', 243, 3, 5, 448467) Referring to the amendment of Mr. Kaleswarrao, Gandhiji said that the 15th of January had been fixed for the next elections, because many of the Congressmen would be in election fever till then, and when they survived that fever they could get together and hold the elections.
('65', 243, 4, 6, 448744) Regarding the Socialists Gandhiji said that there is nothing to be fluttered about.
('65', 243, 4, 7, 448828) If a certain group cannot work the constitution it was up to that group to hand over the working of the Congress in that part to the group which was creating disturbance, saying that they would surrender everything to them.
('65', 243, 4, 8, 449052) There need be no suspicion of the Socialist group, continued Gandhiji.
('65', 243, 4, 9, 449123) They would certainly help all because they were also out to serve the starving humanity.
('65', 243, 4, 10, 449212) If the Socialists rise in power and capture it, they have a perfect right to do so.
('65', 243, 5, 11, 449296) The speaker, referring to the single transferable vote, said.
('65', 243, 5, 12, 449358) that there were several occasions when he had to dodge himself out of inconvenient corners and every Congressman would have to do the same.
('65', 243, 5, 13, 449498) It would be difficult as far as the village workers were concerned, but if it were the speaker, he would ask the Socialists either to join him in his work and carry on shoulder to shoulder, or leave the village to that group and go to the next village.
('65', 243, 6, 14, 449751) There was some discussion over the time of the year when Congress should be held, and it was decided that it should be held some time in February or March.
('65', 243, 6, 15, 449907) It was specially being held in February or March, said Gandhiji, because the villagers in their langotis could come and the Subjects Committee members could hug them.
('65', 243, 6, 16, 450074) (Cheers)
('65', 243, 7, 17, 450083) Mr. C. Rajagopalachari moved that option should be given to the provinces regarding the appliance of the single transferable vote.
('65', 243, 7, 18, 450214) Mahatmaji refused to accept the suggestion, and voted against the amendment.
('65', 243, 8, 19, 450291) Gandhiji, laughing, said that if the vote had gone against him, he was about to demand a poll.
('65', 243, 8, 20, 450386) (Laughter)
('65', 243, 9, 21, 450397) The sub committee’s report was unanimously passed.
('65', 243, 10, 22, 450448) Mahatmaji thanked the Subjects Committee for unanimously approving the report.
('65', 243, 10, 23, 450527) He announced that Karachi had decided to become a separate province.
('65', 243, 10, 24, 450596) He also made an announcement that it would not be a surprise if members of the A. I. C. C. were asked to pay Rs. 10 each.
('65', 243, 10, 25, 450718) The delegates’ fee would also be Rs. 5 and not Rs. IO as at present.

('65', 244, 1, 2, 450836) When the resolution regarding the Indian States was about to be moved, Mahatmaji stated that the problem of the Indian States was a very delicate one.
('65', 244, 2, 3, 450987) Gandhiji has prepared the following draft resolution, indicating the Working Committee’s views on the Indian States peoples.
('65', 244, 2, 4, 451112) Gandhiji, however, advised that this proposal be not adopted by Congress, but that a formula be evolved by a sub committee, in consultation with States’ subjects’ representatives.
('65', 244, 2, 5, 451292) This sub committee’s report would be placed before the next meeting of the A. I. C. C. Gandhiji’s draft formula runs:
('65', 244, 3, 6, 451410) As numerous resolutions have been received from various groups for adoption by Congress, and urging it to define its policy in regard to Indian States, it is hereby resolved as follows: Congress adheres to its policy of the internal administration of various States.
('65', 244, 3, 7, 451677) Congress, however, regards the whole of geographical India as an indivisible whole, notwithstanding the fact that it is cut up into parts governed under different systems and, therefore, expresses its regret over the tendency of some Princes to regard as foreigners Indians from parts of India other than their own, and repeats its appeal, made at the previous sessions of Congress, to establish respon sible government within their jurisdiction, and recognize the necessity of guaranteeing civic and political liberty of people living in their territories.
('65', 244, 3, 8, 452235) This Congress assures the people residing in different States of full sympathy with their just aspirations and for fuller self expression.

('65', 258, 1, 2, 478260) 281. SPEECH AT CONGRESS SESSION, BOMBAY1
('65', 258, 2, 3, 478301) October 28, 1934
('65', 258, 3, 4, 478318) MR. PRESIDENT, SISTERS AND BROTHERS,
('65', 258, 4, 5, 478355) First and foremost, I crave pardon from all sisters and brothers that copies of the resolution proposing changes in the present constitution have not reached you.
('65', 258, 4, 6, 478518) In spite of the trouble the Reception Committee had taken, there was so much to do that it seemed near impossible to get it done in three days; but they had resolved to complete the work within three days.
('65', 258, 4, 7, 478724) Today the Subjects Committee also sat for long and therefore copies of this resolution could not be printed.
('65', 258, 4, 8, 478833) There is much to amend but it is a matter for the legal pundits.
('65', 258, 4, 9, 478898) I shall explain to you in a few minutes the amendments that have been accepted.
('65', 258, 4, 10, 478978) We could have asked you to come again tomorrow evening for this same purpose; that means the Reception Committee would have had to spend so much money unnecessarily and your time and money would be wasted.
('65', 258, 4, 11, 479184) It has never been my intention to have my resolution passed by Unfair means by not letting you see it.
('65', 258, 4, 12, 479287) You are already acquainted with the present constitution.
('65', 258, 4, 13, 479345) Experience has shown that 6,000 delegates were an unwieldy number.
('65', 258, 4, 14, 479412) At the Nagpur Congress there were 14,000 delegates but they were not elected by any constituencies and represented mostly themselves.
('65', 258, 4, 15, 479546) Now it is proposed to reduce the number of delegates to 2,000. I wanted only 1,000 delegates but yielded to the opposition and accepted 2,000. I wanted the delegates to agree to this sacrifice in number in the cause of freedom.
('65', 258, 4, 16, 479774) There is at present no direct contact between the Congress delegates and electors.
('65', 258, 4, 17, 479857) This change in the constitution will not get us swaraj but will help the Congress to stand as a rival to the Assembly in showing that the Congress delegates also speak for their electorate.
('65', 258, 4, 18, 480047) Hereafter, Congress inspectors will look into the registers and only such Congressmen will be allowed to vote as have been on its rolls for at least six months.
('65', 258, 4, 19, 480208) Unless there are 500 Congressmen, they will not be entitled to elect a delegate to the Congress.
('65', 258, 4, 20, 480305) This is too poor,
('65', 258, 5, 21, 480323) 1 Gandhiji first spoke in Hindi at the 48th session of the Indian National Congress, presided over by Rajendra Prasad
('65', 259, 0, 1, 480441) 260 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 259, 1, 2, 480483) compared to the Assembly where 8,000 voters elect one member, but I am satisfied with such a beginning for the organization representing poor people.
('65', 259, 1, 3, 480633) As swaraj cannot be attained without roping villages into the Congress scheme, it has been provided that of Congress shall represent rural areas, i.e., places with a population of l0,000 and under.
('65', 259, 1, 4, 480831) Representation will be by single transferable vote and there will be plural constituencies.
('65', 259, 1, 5, 480923) As for the A. I. C. C., it is always difficult to call 350 members who cannot afford the expense of frequent meetings.
('65', 259, 1, 6, 481042) Thus the A. I. C. C. has been reduced to the maximum of 166. Then again, no democrat would like that the Congress President should be elected by the Reception Committee on recommendations of Provincial Congress Committees but hereafter the delegates themselves will elect the President.
('65', 259, 2, 7, 481329) Gandhiji then explained the khadi clause and the spinning franchise and said:
('65', 259, 3, 8, 481407) I do not mind if you reject these, but if you adopt them, you should do so with absolute conviction.
('65', 259, 3, 9, 481508) Please vote not out of regard for me but in the interest of the motherland.
('65', 259, 3, 10, 481584) When I read the newspaper and the public comments on my proposals, I gave up the idea of publishing them for general consideration.
('65', 259, 3, 11, 481716) But members of the Working Committee thought it fit to put them before you.
('65', 259, 3, 12, 481792) I have listened to the opinions of others on the scheme for change.
('65', 259, 3, 13, 481860) They have presented their case very ably.
('65', 259, 3, 14, 481902) But they were either deceiving themselves or they were playing the role of an attorney.
('65', 259, 3, 15, 481990) And they claimed that they had climbed down from idealism to practicality.
('65', 259, 3, 16, 482065) But has socialism no ideals?
('65', 259, 3, 17, 482094) If I told them to give up even a single one of their ideals, they would defeat my resolution.
('65', 259, 3, 18, 482188) Do you ever realize that purna swaraj may come only in the next generation?
('65', 259, 3, 19, 482264) The socialist ideal is higher than even this.
('65', 259, 3, 20, 482310) I say we need a measuring rod.
('65', 259, 3, 21, 482341) Please [do not] think over this matter with the hope that on this resolution having passed, I may reconsider my retirement.
('65', 259, 3, 22, 482465) If I began my leadership of the Congress with a constitution for which I am mainly responsible, then, while taking my leave, I wish to present you this amended constitution so that you can gain by the experience of one who tried in collaboration with you to work this constitution and found some defects in it.
('65', 259, 3, 23, 482776) Therefore I wish you should carry these amendments.
('65', 260, 0, 1, 482828) VOL.65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 261
('65', 260, 1, 2, 482878) One more thing is that the delegates should be sincere and truly representative of the people.
('65', 260, 1, 3, 482973) Indirectly we are the representatives of the mute millions.
('65', 260, 1, 4, 483033) We voice their views.
('65', 260, 1, 5, 483055) From 1886 this has been the position of the Congress.
('65', 260, 1, 6, 483109) But we represent the electorate only indirectly.
('65', 260, 1, 7, 483158) Can any one of us say whose representative he is?
('65', 260, 1, 8, 483208) Is he in contact with his own constituency and does he reflect their views?
('65', 260, 1, 9, 483284) Can the biggest among us say what place he represents?
('65', 260, 1, 10, 483339) Vallabhbhai is the uncrowned king of Gujarat but which constituency does he represent?
('65', 260, 1, 11, 483426) Whom do I represent?
('65', 260, 1, 12, 483447) I myself do not know it.
('65', 260, 1, 13, 483472) I challenge everyone to submit the Congress register of his electorate.
('65', 260, 1, 14, 483544) We must have a living contact with our constituency and with our voters; only then can we have our measuring rod.
('65', 260, 1, 15, 483658) The principle that I am putting before you is that the three elections should all be held simultaneously.
('65', 260, 1, 16, 483764) This will be economically feasible and save some expenditure.
('65', 260, 1, 17, 483826) If you accept this principle its future will be unshakable.
('65', 260, 1, 18, 483886) Then the delegates will be chosen by their electorates.
('65', 260, 1, 19, 483942) Then they would not, like today, gather for three days only to disappear later.
('65', 260, 1, 20, 484022) They would be active members of the Congress working all through the year.
('65', 260, 1, 21, 484097) Today, out of 6,350 delegates only 350 are members of the All India Congress Committee.
('65', 260, 1, 22, 484185) Then, in Madras or Bardoli a Congress session of a hundred delegates can be called.
('65', 260, 1, 23, 484269) I have made a detailed scheme for organizing such village sessions.
('65', 260, 1, 24, 484337) The villagers will be at your beck and call but they will not be able to give you money for the Reception Committee.
('65', 260, 1, 25, 484454) I object to lakhs of rupees being spent on buntings and arches and other fanfare by Reception Committees.
('65', 260, 1, 26, 484560) Have we attained victory?
('65', 260, 1, 27, 484586) Some friends even said that this subject should be transferred to the provinces.
('65', 260, 1, 28, 484667) Why do you want to transfer this to the provinces?
('65', 260, 1, 29, 484718) Why do you avoid doing your duty?
('65', 260, 1, 30, 484752) Do not swerve from the path of your duty.
('65', 260, 1, 31, 484794) I assure you that all your criticism has been duly considered.
('65', 260, 1, 32, 484857) I am giving you a very complex and strict constitution from which no one can stray.
('65', 260, 1, 33, 484941) If you find any fault in it, you may drop it.
('65', 260, 1, 34, 484987) I wish you accept my advice.
('65', 260, 1, 35, 485016) I wish to say that if you leave this matter to the provinces, you will be wasting one precious year of the nation’s life.
('65', 260, 1, 36, 485138) The procedure adopted in electing members of the Working Committee has been made part of the Congress constitution.
('65', 260, 1, 37, 485254) The constitution has been so framed that there would be no difficulty in the election of the President.
('65', 260, 1, 38, 485358) If you want us to carry on the work, let us have the rights we demand.

('65', 261, 1, 2, 485471) In the end, Gandhiji appealed to the representatives to adopt the new constitution with the determination to make it a signal success.
('65', 261, 1, 3, 485606) (Cheers) Continuing in English, Gandhiji said: I am now speaking in English, trying to produce the same sentiment which I conveyed in the national language.
('65', 261, 1, 4, 485763) It is difficult to do that, because you cannot pour your soul twice in two different languages.
('65', 261, 1, 5, 485859) The soul speaks with the deepest emotion and its sound comes out of the deepest recesses.
('65', 261, 1, 6, 485949) You don’t want to examine the speaker for his ability to make a speech.
('65', 261, 1, 7, 486021) You want to do national work with him.
('65', 261, 1, 8, 486060) I simply want to say this that you will kindly forgive me for not giving you as full an explanation of the constitution as is required.
('65', 261, 1, 9, 486196) The resolution is of a far reaching character.
('65', 261, 1, 10, 486243) It calls upon the Congress to repeat the history of self denial and further reduce the size of the delegates and the A.I.C.C. In conclusion, I would appeal to the delegates to adopt the new constitution with the desire to make it a glorious success.

('65', 261, 9, 19, 486770) If Congressmen have understood the spirit underlying my retirement from the Congress, it ought to mean the redoubling of honest and persistent effort to return Congress candidates to the Assembly.
('65', 261, 9, 20, 486967) I have retired not to weaken the national organization, but to strengthen it.

('65', 262, 1, 5, 487459) When we achieve our goal, as we will and must, the Congress will be found to have contributed the largest share in the attainment.
('65', 262, 1, 6, 487590) There is, thus, in the present fight, a battle between measures, not men.
('65', 262, 1, 7, 487664) Every vote given to a Congress candidate means so much progress towards our goal.
('65', 262, 1, 8, 487746) An institution that has just passed a self denying ordinance in the shape of the new rigorous constitution, in my opinion, deserves universal support.
('65', 262, 1, 9, 487897) That can just now be best expressed by sending as many Congressmen as possible to the Assembly.

('65', 262, 5, 13, 488060) I have seen a newspaper paragraph attributing to me the opinion that silk yarn is drawn from some “imported stuff ” and that therefore I consider it to be not fit for use.
('65', 262, 5, 14, 488232) I have never expressed any such opinion.

('65', 263, 9, 19, 489576) This does not imply any censure against any of you.
('65', 263, 9, 20, 489628) It is a matter of self denial and restraint.

('65', 264, 2, 3, 489955) October 30, 1934
('65', 264, 3, 4, 489972) I received during my silence in Bombay several queries from Pressmen, but I had no time to give written replies then.
('65', 264, 3, 5, 490090) Visitors continued to pour in for whom I had to scribble out replies practically till the time of my leaving the camp.
('65', 264, 3, 6, 490209) Now I answer these and some others that have cropped up since.
('65', 264, 3, 7, 490272) The first is whether I have already tendered my resignation.
('65', 264, 3, 8, 490333) Formally, I had not done so till October 28, but it is presently going, in the form of a letter addressed to Rajendrababu and other officials concerned.
('65', 264, 3, 9, 490486) 1 This does not mean that I cease to take interest in the politics of the country or in its political future.
('65', 264, 3, 10, 490596) Much less does it mean that I cease to take interest in the welfare of the organization for whose good I have left it.
('65', 264, 3, 11, 490715) But, what will happen is that I shall cease to be interested in the details of the working of the Congress.
('65', 264, 3, 12, 490823) And I shall certainly cease to shape the policy of the Congress organization as I had the privilege of doing till the last moment of the session.
('65', 264, 3, 13, 490969) Let me give one or two illustrations.
('65', 264, 3, 14, 491007) Whilst I was observing silence yesterday, Rajendrababu and several members of the Working Committee came to discuss with me the composition of the new Working Committee.
('65', 264, 3, 15, 491177) Hardly had we proceeded to discuss one or two names when I saw the utter incongruity of what I was doing.
('65', 264, 3, 16, 491283) I, therefore, immediately wrote out on my scribbling pad, “Surely, I may not discuss these things now.” Members present immediately realized the significance of my remark and they very generously removed themselves some distance from me and began to discuss them in whispers and I may state that, up to the time of dictating this at Wardha, I am unaware of the composition of the new Working Committee.
('65', 264, 3, 17, 491686) I was taking a lively interest, even up to the time of my departure, in the unfortunate Ajmer dispute.
('65', 264, 3, 18, 491789) But Congressmen may understand from these two illustrations that I can no longer be looked up to for advice or guidance in such matters.
('65', 264, 3, 19, 491926) If I continue to interest myself in the day to day working of the organization or in the domestic quarrels, not only would the whole of the salutary effect of my retirement be undone, but I would become a powerful factor for

('65', 265, 1, 2, 492284) disturbance, not having the grasp of details which alone has hitherto been a predominant factor in enabling me to come to correct judgment in a vast majority of cases.
('65', 265, 2, 3, 492452) My interest in the Congress organization will, henceforth, be confined to watching, from at a distance, the enforcement of principles for which the Congress stands.
('65', 265, 2, 4, 492617) Congressmen may therefore expect, whenever I feel like giving it, a criticism of methods that may be pursued by the organization as a whole or its members as individuals.
('65', 265, 2, 5, 492788) But this again does not mean that I should be receiving letters as I have hitherto received asking me for guidance in daily transactions in connection with the Congress.
('65', 265, 2, 6, 492958) This they must henceforth seek from the President whose guidance will, I know, be invaluable or from those in whom they have confidence.
('65', 265, 2, 7, 493095) I must be left free for the work which I have in mind.
('65', 265, 2, 8, 493150) Let it be borne in mind that I do not regard politics as something different in kind from other national activities.
('65', 265, 2, 9, 493267) The root meaning of politics is the science of citizenship and it has also remote connection with polished manners and since the boundaries of citizenship have been extended to cover continents, the science of politics includes attainment of advancement of humanity along all lines, social, moral, economic and political, using the word ‘political’ here in the narrow sense in which we are accustomed to use it.
('65', 265, 2, 10, 493679) Ever since my return to India in 1915, it has been my earnest endeavour to restore the meaning of politics to its root and if we would be truthful through and through, we should recognize that the predominant part of the Congress programme has been progressively social, moral and economic.
('65', 265, 2, 11, 493970) And it becomes a powerful programme because it is intimately connected with the political, that is, the attainment of freedom of the country from foreign yoke, not from foreign friendship, that is, voluntary intercourse on terms of absolute equality with foreign nations.
('65', 265, 2, 12, 494242) If Congressmen forget the constructive programme and simply confine Congress activities to winning of Assembly and Council elections and of fruitless debates in the Assembly and the Councils, they will soon find that I have taken with me the kernel of politics and they have kept for themselves only the outermost husk, without even the vitamins.
('65', 265, 2, 13, 494589) But I have no such fear.
('65', 265, 2, 14, 494614) Parliamentary Congressmen will advance the Congress programmes and by their votes register the will of the nation.
('65', 266, 0, 1, 494729) VOL.65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 267
('65', 266, 1, 2, 494779) This session of the Congress has been a revelation to me.
('65', 266, 1, 3, 494837) I had expected a battle royal with the members of the Working Committee about the vital amendments I had suggested and afterwards withdrawn, and equally vital alterations in the constitution on which I was insistent, but which had no connection whatsoever with my retirement from the Congress.
('65', 266, 1, 4, 495131) But I found that, apart from my retirement, which they had ascertained was a moral certainty, members of the Working Committee wanted the amendments after their own fashion.
('65', 266, 1, 5, 495305) Every one of them without exception had come to the conclusion that substitution of the words “legitimate and peaceful” by “truthful and nonviolent” was necessary, because of the ambiguity surrounding the two words.
('65', 266, 1, 6, 495521) I could not prevent them from enforcing their own independent judgment.
('65', 266, 2, 7, 495593) The same revelations awaited me in the Subjects Committee.
('65', 266, 2, 8, 495652) The alteration of the creed was not carried, but it was not summarily rejected.
('65', 266, 2, 9, 495732) It was referred to Provincial Congress Committees for opinion.
('65', 266, 2, 10, 495795) And now that I am out of the way and provinces are in a position to exercise their judgment freely and unfettered, I do hope that in order to be true to themselves and the Congress, their first act will be to pronounce their unequivocal opinion on the proposed amendments.
('65', 266, 2, 11, 496068) The ambiguity is patent.
('65', 266, 2, 12, 496093) Many have contested my proposition that “truthful and non violent” are synonymous with “legitimate and peaceful”.
('65', 266, 2, 13, 496207) If the Congress do not attach that meaning to the two words, they should unhesitatingly recommend their removal altogether.
('65', 266, 2, 14, 496331) In adopting this recommendation they will not travel outside the terms of reference.
('65', 266, 2, 15, 496416) Our creed is the measure by which we want mankind to judge us.
('65', 266, 2, 16, 496479) There should surely be no uncertainty about our measure.
('65', 266, 2, 17, 496536) What we insist upon in ordinary affairs of life is surely necessary in national affairs, Even as a mason without his square or a tailor without his yardstick is inconceivable, so also we cannot conceive of a big organization like the Congress without its measure.
('65', 266, 2, 18, 496800) If we have any doubt about the necessity for downright truthfulness and downright non violence for the attainment of complete independence, we should say so.
('65', 266, 2, 19, 496958) There will be nothing wrong in it.
('65', 266, 2, 20, 496993) That would not mean that we have abandoned truth or non violence.
('65', 266, 2, 21, 497059) It would mean that we have ceased to connect truthfulness and non violence with independence, have ceased to see the one as the cause and the other as its inevitable result, have ceased
('65', 267, 0, 1, 497245) 268 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 267, 1, 2, 497287) to think that there is an indissoluble bond between the means and the end.
('65', 267, 1, 3, 497362) If there was difficulty about carrying the amendment to the creed, it was plain sailing with reference to other amendments, both in the Subjects Committee and in the open session.
('65', 267, 1, 4, 497542) What I observed to my delight was also the fact that those who wanted to oppose any of the amendments did so without any hesitation and yet in courteous terms.
('65', 267, 1, 5, 497702) Obedience was ungrudgingly tendered to the chair at all times, whereas I was prepared for boisterous scenes.
('65', 267, 1, 6, 497811) And all the amendments were passed although members knew that I was not remaining in the Congress.
('65', 267, 1, 7, 497910) The manner in which the 1,500 delegates assembled here waived their undoubted right of having copies of the amended draft constitution was an exhibition of generosity and faith of which any nation would be proud.
('65', 267, 1, 8, 498123) And yet all amendments were passed by the delegates with overwhelming majorities after they had understood what they were and what were their implications.
('65', 267, 1, 9, 498279) For they listened for over an hour to my simple unvarnished explanation of all amendments.
('65', 267, 1, 10, 498370) The cheers that punctuated my remarks on some of the most important amendments showed that they were following my exposition with the utmost attention.
('65', 267, 1, 11, 498522) All this was possible because of perfect loudspeaker arrangements that were made as well for the Subjects Committee as for the open session.
('65', 267, 1, 12, 498663) Now that the new constitution is an established fact, the Provincial Congress Committees should realize the necessity for honestly working it.
('65', 267, 1, 13, 498806) Although time has been given to them up to January 15 for holding A. I. C. C. elections and for reducing themselves to l00, where they are over 100, wherever it is possible they should at once do these two things.
('65', 267, 1, 14, 499020) Let me also utter a warning.
('65', 267, 1, 15, 499049) I hope no one will think that the khaddar clause and labour franchise clause do not come into immediate operation.
('65', 267, 1, 16, 499164) They do.
('65', 267, 1, 17, 499173) Those who do not believe in them, those who do not want to wear khaddar as a habit, to the exclusion of all other cloth, or do not want to do some manual labour for the sake of the country, will, if they are members of any elected organization, at once tender their resignations.
('65', 267, 1, 18, 499453) And Provincial Congress Committees will not elect as members of the Committees or of A. I. C. C. those who are not habitual wearers of khaddar or who do not want to do manual labour.
('65', 267, 1, 19, 499636) Spinning is undoubtedly the most natural and the
('65', 268, 0, 1, 499685) VOL.65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 269
('65', 268, 1, 2, 499735) easiest form of labour and is connected with the khaddar clause.
('65', 268, 1, 3, 499800) But those who do not believe in spinning can certainly take up any other kind of manual labour.
('65', 268, 1, 4, 499896) Tailoring is quite easy, whether with the needle or with the sewing machine.
('65', 268, 1, 5, 499973) Sewing four caps would be equivalent to more than 500 yards of evenly spun yarn.
('65', 268, 1, 6, 500054) A day’s cleaning of a neighbouring village would undoubtedly be such an equivalent.
('65', 268, 1, 7, 500138) So would be house to house personal distribution for one day of, say, quinine powder or pills in malarial tracts.
('65', 268, 1, 8, 500252) What is meant by this clause to be symbolical may, in the end, result in many Congressmen becoming experts in the labour they perform and make phenomenal contribution to the economic advancement of the nation.
('65', 268, 1, 9, 500462) This is all civil resistance of the purest type.
('65', 268, 1, 10, 500511) I plead guilty of negligence in that I had not in the past insisted on these things so as to make them a condition precedent to launching out any civil disobedience.
('65', 268, 1, 11, 500677) I had been overborne by the argument that the nation would take up these things in the course of civil disobedience.
('65', 268, 1, 12, 500794) That expectation has not been realized.
('65', 268, 1, 13, 500834) My retirement from the Congress may be regarded as a penance for the negligence although it was wholly unconscious.
('65', 268, 1, 14, 500950) But calling myself, as I do, an expert in the science of civil resistance, I may not plead ignorance as excuse.
('65', 268, 1, 15, 501062) I hope, therefore, the vital clauses of the constitution will be immediately put into operation.
('65', 268, 1, 16, 501159) What I am aiming at is development of capacity for civil resistance so that there never may be any need for civil disobedience.
('65', 268, 1, 17, 501287) Disobedience that is wholly civil should never provoke retaliation.

('65', 268, 3, 20, 501396) B. C. ROY
('65', 268, 4, 21, 501406) October 30, 1934
('65', 268, 5, 22, 501423) DEAR DR.
('65', 268, 5, 23, 501432) BIDHAN, I have a bad cold.
('65', 268, 5, 24, 501459) Therefore, instead of writing this letter, I am driven to dictating.
('65', 268, 5, 25, 501528) You have let me feel that I must think you as one of my intimate co workers to whom I could speak and write without reserve.
('65', 268, 5, 26, 501653) You have even resented my reserve when you have detected it.
('65', 268, 5, 27, 501714) I am taking the liberty of writing this letter without reserve.
('65', 268, 5, 28, 501778) I allowed myself to be party to a discussion over the names of the new Working Committee.
('65', 268, 5, 29, 501868) Rajendrababu and other members came to me during my silence and opened the discussion.
('65', 268, 5, 30, 501955) We had come to
('65', 269, 0, 1, 501970) 270 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 269, 1, 2, 502012) two names.
('65', 269, 1, 3, 502023) I had suggested one name as a substitute for Jawaharlal whilst he was in prison, and when we came to discuss the Bengal representative, I gave my opinion.
('65', 269, 1, 4, 502178) But I saw that I was doing violence to my pledge that I shall cease to be a member of the Congress after the session.
('65', 269, 1, 5, 502296) I did not, therefore, attend the meeting of the A. I. C. C. that day nor of the Working Committee.
('65', 269, 1, 6, 502395) I, therefore, abruptly stopped the discussion and wrote on the scribbling pad: “Surely I may not discuss these things now.” Of course, further discussion was carried on by the members without my listening to it.
('65', 269, 1, 7, 502607) The difficulty that they had was to choose as a Bengal representative either you or Prafulla Ghosh.
('65', 269, 1, 8, 502707) I wrote saying that Maulana Saheb 1 alone should be given the Bengal representation, and that neither you nor Prafulla Ghosh should be in it.
('65', 269, 1, 9, 502849) I wrote further that if anybody had to be elected, besides the Maulana, it must be you.
('65', 269, 1, 10, 502937) It was impossible to overlook you without slighting the present Provincial Congress Committee unless you yourself chose to stand aside.
('65', 269, 1, 11, 503073) It was at this stage that I discovered my error and abruptly stopped taking part in the discussion.
('65', 269, 1, 12, 503173) But without any compunction, having gone as far as I did, I can write to you that I feel that.
('65', 269, 1, 13, 503268) the act of self denial which I have recommended would be the best thing for Bengal politics.
('65', 269, 1, 14, 503361) You know how I have three times suppressed Rajagopalachari or, rather, how Rajagopalachari has allowed himself to be suppressed.
('65', 269, 1, 15, 503490) I do not think that the country has lost by that suppression.
('65', 269, 1, 16, 503552) Rajagopalachari has certainly gained, and if today he is most useful in the parliamentary struggle in the South, I have no doubt that it is due to this self denial.
('65', 269, 1, 17, 503717) But, of course, I may be wholly wrong in my judgment in this case.
('65', 269, 1, 18, 503784) I felt that I would be untrue to you if I did not pass on the opinion that I formed yesterday, but which I could not express as fully as I have done here.
('65', 269, 1, 19, 503939) If this letter is not helpful, you will please dismiss it from your mind altogether.
('65', 269, 1, 20, 504024) But I hope that in no case would you consider it to be an impertinent interference.
('65', 269, 1, 21, 504108) The fact is that, so far as I am concerned, we have been coming closer day by day.
('65', 269, 1, 22, 504191) The association with you in Calcutta during my recent visit 2 brought you closer to me.

('65', 271, 8, 15, 506492) I have pre mortgaged my time for things which I may not put off.
('65', 271, 8, 16, 506557) Therefore I can make no promise nor hold out any hope.
('65', 271, 8, 17, 506612) I do not know what the future has in store for me.
('65', 271, 8, 18, 506663) If I can see my way clear for some months to come I would love to undertake the travel you have suggested.
('65', 271, 8, 19, 506770) Meanwhile if you have approached this subject as an earnest seeker, give me a vivid description of the six backward tribes.
('65', 271, 8, 20, 506894) It must be readable, brief and worth publishing in the columns of Harijan.
('65', 271, 8, 21, 506969) You must give me also a little more introduction to yourself.
('65', 271, 8, 22, 507031) Who are you?
('65', 271, 8, 23, 507044) What are you doing?

('65', 272, 4, 5, 507396) Jamnalalji will give you the [draft of the] constitution.
('65', 272, 4, 6, 507454) I have gone through it carefully.
('65', 272, 4, 7, 507488) The changes which I have suggested should not be difficult to understand.
('65', 272, 4, 8, 507562) But if I have misunderstood the meaning anywhere, delay of a day or two will not matter.
('65', 272, 4, 9, 507651) If you write to me in detail, I will try to see my mistake.
('65', 272, 4, 10, 507711) The copy sent by you did not include the forms.
('65', 272, 4, 11, 507759) It would be good if the appendix also gives, in addition to [the list of] members of the All India Congress Committee, the maximum number of members which each province can send.
('65', 272, 4, 12, 507938) If this cannot be done, however, the printing need not be delayed on that account.
('65', 272, 4, 13, 508021) The Secretary also can announce these figures.
('65', 272, 4, 14, 508068) Let Jairamdas and Kishorelal, if he is all right, go through the changes.
('65', 272, 4, 15, 508142) I hope they will find no difficulty in deciphering my handwriting.
('65', 272, 4, 16, 508209) Tell Jairamdas that he should issue some of the notices which have to be issued immediately.
('65', 272, 4, 17, 508302) Please examine A, F(a) and such other things.

('65', 272, 10, 24, 508519) Sharma’s problem is a difficult one.
('65', 272, 10, 25, 508556) Hold him back as long as your influence on him works.
('65', 272, 10, 26, 508610) See that he doesn’t starve or remain unprotected against the cold.
('65', 272, 10, 27, 508677) His view of people is generally perverted.
('65', 272, 10, 28, 508720) He regards as good those about whom we are doubtful and as bad those whom we think to be good.
('65', 272, 10, 29, 508815) This is a difficult disease to cure.
('65', 272, 10, 30, 508852) How can we help if people misunderstand one another?
('65', 272, 10, 31, 508905) But I will not give up hope.
('65', 272, 10, 32, 508934) My diagnosis is that he is deceiving himself and not the world.
('65', 272, 10, 33, 508998) I see no evil in him but a transparent frankness.
('65', 272, 10, 34, 509048) However, he is by nature proud and has too much confidence in his

('65', 273, 7, 12, 509474) You will stay in the Ashram itself when you come.
('65', 273, 7, 13, 509524) Vinoba is also agreeable.
('65', 273, 7, 14, 509550) On your assurance I shall be free of anxiety.
('65', 273, 7, 15, 509596) You may take it that I shall not worry if you do not strain yourself.
('65', 273, 7, 16, 509666) For my part, I want to rope in Draupadi too but that can be done only when you are settled.
('65', 273, 7, 17, 509758) Your shawl is not to be found.
('65', 273, 7, 18, 509789) Possibly the boy who was staying here took it away.
('65', 273, 7, 19, 509841) He is no longer here.

('65', 273, 13, 27, 510104) I have your letter.
('65', 273, 13, 28, 510124) If you and your friend have enough money for return passage and can pay your expenses here, say, at the rate of Rs. 100 per month each, you can come whenever you like.
('65', 273, 13, 29, 510292) The sooner the better so as to get the benefit of such cold weather as we get here.
('65', 273, 13, 30, 510376) The Rs. 100 per month I have calculated as the outside limit for those who can live simply.
('65', 273, 13, 31, 510468) It may cost you even half the amount.
('65', 273, 13, 32, 510506) It all depends upon how the climate here agrees with you.

('65', 275, 2, 3, 512318) October31/November 2, 1934
('65', 275, 3, 4, 512345) MY DEAR AGATHA,
('65', 275, 4, 5, 512361) I have been wanting to write to you every week; but it was impossible.
('65', 275, 4, 6, 512432) You know the situation now.
('65', 275, 4, 7, 512460) I am free and it is all to the good.
('65', 275, 4, 8, 512497) Here is a copy of my statement to the Press made immediately after the breaking of silence, that is, made on the 30th.
('65', 275, 4, 9, 512616) I want to devote next month at least to Harijan work and to launching out the contemplated Village Industries Association.
('65', 275, 4, 10, 512739) But I want to pave the way for the Frontier even from now.
('65', 275, 4, 11, 512798) I hope to be able to send my letter to the Government in a day or two.
('65', 275, 4, 12, 512869) If I do, you will have a copy of it herewith.
('65', 275, 4, 13, 512915) This is being dictated on 31st.
('65', 275, 4, 14, 512947) This may be posted from Wardha on the 2nd November.
('65', 275, 4, 15, 512999) My desire throughout is so to act as to disarm all suspicion about the character of civil disobedience.
('65', 275, 4, 16, 513103) At the present moment there is no question of others participating in it.
('65', 275, 4, 17, 513177) So far as I can see the future, there is no likelihood of my initiating or precipitating mass civil disobedience for some years to come.
('65', 275, 4, 18, 513314) I want to test the genuineness of public feeling by keeping myself aloof from the Congress and watching from a distance how Congressmen in general take to the constructive programme.
('65', 275, 4, 19, 513497) Civil resistance can properly culminate in civil disobedience only when people learn the art of civil resistance which is nothing less and nothing more than refraining from doing anything that would keep up a system which you seek to destroy.
('65', 275, 4, 20, 513740) I observe that without breaking a single law, villagers can somewhat better their economic condition by reviving their industries.
('65', 275, 4, 21, 513871) Hence the Village Industries Association.
('65', 275, 4, 22, 513913) Hindu Muslim tension also enables the system to live, and so does untouchability, so does the drink evil.
('65', 275, 4, 23, 514019) People had sufficient experience now in this kind of training.
('65', 275, 4, 24, 514082) I am, therefore, resisting every temptation to invite civil disobedience by the people.
('65', 275, 4, 25, 514170) There is temptation enough.
('65', 275, 4, 26, 514198) Even the prisoners in Bombay who were thought to be discharged are still in the various jails of the Presidency of Bombay.
('65', 275, 4, 27, 514321) Buildings which have been seized by the Government are not being returned.
('65', 275, 4, 28, 514396) I can multiply such instances drawn from various provinces.
('65', 275, 4, 29, 514456) Nevertheless I know that I have to live down these irritations and so have fellow workers.

('65', 276, 1, 2, 514597) appears to me just now the best form of resistance, if it may be so called.
('65', 276, 1, 3, 514673) But if I may not go [to] the Frontier, and if there is no just cause for preventing me from going there, it may prove the last straw and I will again find myself utterly incapable of doing constructive work.
('65', 276, 1, 4, 514881) I must receive this elementary satisfaction of the soul.
('65', 276, 1, 5, 514938) Let me not anticipate.
('65', 276, 1, 6, 514961) All I can say is that I shall not rush to the jail.
('65', 276, 1, 7, 515013) You will have ample notice.
('65', 276, 1, 8, 515041) I hope Mira had a successful tour in America.
('65', 276, 1, 9, 515087) You will share this letter with C. F. Andrews and whomsoever you like.

('65', 276, 7, 15, 515379) November 2, 1934
('65', 276, 8, 16, 515396) MY DEAR SHANKERLAL,
('65', 276, 9, 17, 515416) I enclose herewith a letter from Hiralal M. Garhwal.
('65', 276, 9, 18, 515469) If the figures of the Hindi speaking population for the Ahmedabad district are correct, evidently, the arrangements for schooling of Hindi knowing children are inadequate.
('65', 276, 9, 19, 515641) If what Hiralal says is true, I take it that most of the Hindi speaking residents of Ahmedabad district are concentrated in the city and that they are mostly millhands.
('65', 276, 9, 20, 515810) You will, therefore, let me know if you know anything about this and whether the Municipality is doing anything for them.
('65', 276, 9, 21, 515932) I enclose herewith also another letter.
('65', 276, 9, 22, 515972) It is from Annadababu.
('65', 276, 9, 23, 515995) He was here and in the course of the conversation there was an incidental reference to Dr. Sanyal’s behaviour in the Subjects Committee.
('65', 276, 9, 24, 516132) Apart from his behaviour, if what Annadababu says is correct, I suppose that whoever is responsible for enhancing the rent

('65', 277, 1, 3, 516362) And if there was threat of withdrawal of certificates, the wrong was multiplied.
('65', 277, 1, 4, 516443) Do you know anything about this?
('65', 277, 1, 5, 516476) I remember your mentioning to me something about the reshuffling of rent.

('65', 277, 13, 19, 517061) MY DEAR GANESAN,
('65', 277, 14, 20, 517078) I was extremely sorry that I was not able to talk to you as much as I would have liked.
('65', 277, 14, 21, 517166) You are hasty in your judgment about Thakkar Bapa.
('65', 277, 14, 22, 517217) He is a man with a great heart.
('65', 277, 14, 23, 517249) You have to win him over by your humility, meekness and precision in work.
('65', 277, 14, 24, 517324) That you are precise I know to my cost.
('65', 277, 14, 25, 517364) But I cling to you because I believe you to be hard working, honest and selfsacrificing.
('65', 277, 14, 26, 517453) You are taking responsib ilities beyond your capacity and then find yourself always in want and distress.
('65', 277, 14, 27, 517559) I would, therefore, strongly discourage you against taking up more than you can, and then do thoroughly whatever you have.
('65', 277, 14, 28, 517682) You will then find that you will be able to manage your domestic problem also much more successfully than you are now doing.

('65', 278, 1, 3, 517934) For the reasons I have given you I cannot contemplate any such thing.
('65', 278, 1, 4, 518004) I wish I could trust you to discharge that burden in an efficient manner.
('65', 278, 1, 5, 518078) And then too we have not enough liberty for conducting a fearless paper of the type of Young India.
('65', 278, 1, 6, 518178) Therefore, I would like you to concentrate upon what you have.
('65', 278, 1, 7, 518241) You can then think of more, and I should be glad to do what I can.

('65', 279, 14, 28, 520191) It is, therefore, good that you cannot spare the time just now.
('65', 279, 14, 29, 520255) I would be happy if I am mistaken in my judgment.

('65', 280, 1, 4, 520633) Whether I can contribute substantially to it depends upon my going or not going to jail.
('65', 280, 1, 5, 520722) Of course, I am certainly eager to avoid such an eventuality.

('65', 280, 7, 14, 521028) I understand the position.
('65', 280, 7, 15, 521055) At present Sharma cannot be sent abroad and since he can go only after he is well settled he has no alternative but to stay on here.
('65', 280, 7, 16, 521188) It would be best if he lives with his family and takes up some occupation.
('65', 280, 7, 17, 521263) But neither his family nor Draupadi wants it.
('65', 280, 7, 18, 521309) They all want him to stay with me.
('65', 280, 7, 19, 521344) I am aware of his merits.
('65', 280, 7, 20, 521370) If my analysis of his failings is correct I shall be able to cope with them.

('65', 281, 4, 21, 523097) I stick to my diagnosis: suspicion, pride and fault finding.
('65', 281, 4, 22, 523158) Time alone is the antidote for suspicion; reducing oneself to a cipher is the remedy for pride and the cure for finding faults with others is to see one’s own faults.
('65', 281, 4, 23, 523325) If one regards oneself as the worst of all, one will not see faults in others and every fault will seem to be a form of illness.
('65', 281, 4, 24, 523454) I shall certainly give you part of my day to discuss things but discussions alone will not help.

('65', 282, 4, 7, 524494) I do not want you to neglect your work there, nor do I want you to take up this work before you can be disengaged from the responsibility there.
('65', 282, 4, 8, 524639) Before you or I can ask Rajendrababu about disengaging you, you have to judge for yourself when you can safely disengage yourself.
('65', 282, 4, 9, 524770) And if you cannot, you will say so.
('65', 282, 4, 10, 524806) You will then give me your own views, and I shall see what can be or should be done.
('65', 282, 4, 11, 524891) If you have any names of those who can form the Board, send me those names and any other suggestions that you have to make.

('65', 282, 10, 21, 525334) I was glad to receive your letter and I thank you for the gift of the very useful volume on the constitutions of different countries.
('65', 282, 10, 22, 525468) As you will be coming 2, I do not deal with the different points you have raised in your letter and the questions you have asked.
('65', 282, 10, 23, 525598) If you can come between the 10th and 15th of this month, it would be very convenient.
('65', 282, 10, 24, 525684) I shall keep your letter by me, and we shall discuss the points raised by you.

('65', 283, 5, 8, 526493) November 3, 1934
('65', 283, 6, 9, 526510) Note 3: In both (a) and (b), the word “member” 2 is used to denote a primary member, whereas whenever the word “membership” occurs the reference is to an elected member.
('65', 283, 6, 10, 526680) At both places, therefore, you should use either “member” or “person”.
('65', 283, 6, 11, 526751) “Member” at one place and “person” at another will not be correct.
('65', 283, 6, 12, 526818) The word “member” is not likely to be interpreted to mean a member holding an elective post.
('65', 283, 6, 13, 526911) All the same, you should use the same word at both places, whichever you prefer.
('65', 283, 7, 14, 526992) Note 5: Bapu feels that the words “every district” throughout will serve the purposefully, or that, alternatively, the amendment suggested by him should be retained.
('65', 283, 7, 15, 527158) Using the word “town” only will not permit the additional members in one town to be “amalgamated” with the additional members in another town in the same district, and will also create difficulties in forming constituencies with a minimum of five members.
('65', 283, 8, 16, 527414) Note 6: In clause (h) Bapu suggests the following amendment in place of the one suggested by you: “When the number of duly qualified primary members exceeds the minimum required for electing 2,000 delegates, the Working Committee shall readjust the minimum of 500 duly qualified primary members required per delegate so as to maintain the maximum for all India and the balance between urban and rural areas as per clause f(1) hereof.”

('65', 283, 10, 19, 528130) He now returns the lot with the following suggestions.” 2 Portions within quotes in this letter are in English.
('65', 284, 0, 1, 528242) VOL.65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 285
('65', 284, 1, 2, 528292) C.” would stand dissolved and fresh elections would be held.
('65', 284, 1, 3, 528353) According to the proposed arrangement, the delegates once elected will continue for the whole year and the composition of the “A. I. C. C.” also will remain the same, and the special session will be attended by the same persons, unless of course the delegates as a general body wish to dissolve the “A. I. C. C.” and elect a fresh one in its place.
('65', 284, 1, 4, 528702) That right belongs to every “bigger body’,.
('65', 284, 1, 5, 528746) But otherwise there should be no need at all to elect a fresh “A. I. C. C.’, or “W. C.” merely in order that a special session might be held.
('65', 284, 2, 6, 528888) Note 11: If an assurance was given to the “A. I. C. C.” on Monday that the conditions mentioned in Article “III” would not, till the 1st of July, be applied to members elected just now, there is nothing to be said about it.
('65', 284, 2, 7, 529112) Personally, however, Bapu could not reconcile himself to giving members permission to remain idle till then.
('65', 284, 2, 8, 529221) There was definitely no such understanding when the constitution was passed.
('65', 284, 2, 9, 529298) If, however, the assurance was given to the “A. I. C. C.” in view of some other difficulties it must be honoured.

('65', 284, 7, 15, 529528) I was glad to have your little note and to observe that you were making steady, though slow, progress.
('65', 284, 7, 16, 529631) I am looking forward to seeing you with Jairamdas as soon as you are discharged.
('65', 284, 7, 17, 529712) But don’t worry the doctors over your discharge.
('65', 284, 7, 18, 529761) Let there be a complete recovery.
('65', 284, 7, 19, 529795) I must not attempt to write to Vidya just now as I want every minute that I can spare.

('65', 285, 11, 18, 530571) The constitution 1 as amended should enable a good worker to make solid progress in working the Congress along right lines.
('65', 285, 11, 19, 530695) If you have any suggestions to make in connection with the Village Industries Association, which is in the process of formation, please do.

('65', 287, 3, 4, 532660) MY DEAR TITUS,
('65', 287, 4, 5, 532675) I have your letter.
('65', 287, 4, 6, 532695) I quite agree with you that Surendra should have brought the matter to your notice before he wrote to me about the cows.
('65', 287, 4, 7, 532816) But you need not worry as I am entirely satisfied that our cattle are not in that condition and that you are in no way to blame with reference to their upkeep.
('65', 287, 4, 8, 532976) Your scheme about removing the dairy to Biraj attracts me.
('65', 287, 4, 9, 533035) I would personally like to let you try.
('65', 287, 4, 10, 533075) But did you not discuss the scheme with Narandas?
('65', 287, 4, 11, 533125) He had written to me, but he is silent about the scheme.
('65', 287, 4, 12, 533182) Please collect opinion and let me know.
('65', 287, 4, 13, 533222) I am arranging for the prompt payment of.
('65', 287, 4, 14, 533264) the monies that are lost.
('65', 287, 4, 15, 533290) I have already asked Narandas as to what I am to do and where it is to be sent.
('65', 287, 4, 16, 533370) There would be no delay after I receive the answer.
('65', 287, 4, 17, 533422) I hope both you and your wife have completely recovered.

('65', 287, 8, 23, 533597) November 5, 1934
('65', 287, 9, 24, 533614) MY DEAR GANESAN,
('65', 287, 10, 25, 533631) I thought that it was understood between you and me that Khan Saheb could not come and that you would ask Kakasaheb to give you a week.
('65', 287, 10, 26, 533767) I do not know whether you asked him.
('65', 287, 10, 27, 533804) It is not possible for me to send anyone else.
('65', 287, 10, 28, 533851) About the Introduction to Vol. III of Young India, I do not know that I shall get the time within the limit fixed by you.
('65', 287, 10, 29, 533973) Mahadev is not here and he may not be for some time.
('65', 287, 10, 30, 534026) On his return he will be overwhelmed with arrears.
('65', 287, 10, 31, 534077) I have written to you already about turning your bi weekly
('65', 288, 0, 1, 534136) VOL.65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 289
('65', 288, 1, 2, 534186) paper into an offlcial organ of the Village Industries Association.
('65', 288, 1, 3, 534254) So long as you are living on the brink of civil debt, I would not think of putting extra burden on you, or trusting that I would be safe in your hands.
('65', 288, 1, 4, 534406) Your desire for extension of your activities is wholly inconsistent with the opening of the second paragraph of your letter wherein you say: “I have reached the limit of perfect recovery.
('65', 288, 1, 5, 534594) Any further delay may mean a breakdown.” I do not know who the friend is who has promised to meet all the expenses.
('65', 288, 1, 6, 534710) If I have a practical, reliable, firm proposition I would be prepared to reconsider my decision.
('65', 288, 1, 7, 534807) What will Sastri 1 do as the editor of the Village Industries Association?
('65', 288, 1, 8, 534882) It requires special knowledge, and so far as I am aware Sastri has absolutely none.
('65', 288, 1, 9, 534966) I do not know what V. S. V. Chari can do.
('65', 288, 1, 10, 535008) A man who writes paragraphs for The Statesman is probably the last man to handle the village industries question with effect.
('65', 288, 1, 11, 535134) But without my identifying myself with your bi weekly you should devote its columns to the constructive programme of the Congress if you can justify the title of your bi weekly.
('65', 288, 1, 12, 535312) I have read your correspondence with Thakkar Bapa.
('65', 288, 1, 13, 535363) The only thing I shall be able to discuss with him is the bill for the Supplements to Harijan.
('65', 288, 1, 14, 535458) I might incidentally have to deal with the other things.

('65', 289, 4, 7, 536210) But how is it that you are the only person moving in the matter?
('65', 289, 4, 8, 536275) I would strongly dissuade you from taking the lead.
('65', 289, 4, 9, 536327) There should be a Universal appeal from the citizens of Karachi or nothing at all.

('65', 289, 16, 26, 536956) RAMDAS,
('65', 289, 17, 27, 536964) I dare not send for you.
('65', 289, 17, 28, 536989) How can I say that my treatment will surely benefit you?
('65', 289, 17, 29, 537046) How can I experiment with you?
('65', 289, 17, 30, 537077) Moreover, once you are here you will surely get involved in a number of things.
('65', 289, 17, 31, 537157) After all, home is home.
('65', 289, 17, 32, 537182) What one happens to see or hear cannot but affect one.
('65', 289, 17, 33, 537237) Precisely for this reason I have left the matter entirely to you.
('65', 290, 0, 1, 537303) VOL.65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 291
('65', 290, 1, 2, 537353) the moment I find my dharma of not opposing your wishes easy enough.
('65', 290, 1, 3, 537422) It is the least likely to be wrong.
('65', 290, 1, 4, 537458) Yet I would suggest this to help you to arrive at a decision.
('65', 290, 1, 5, 537520) After much thinking I am inclined to select Poona.
('65', 290, 1, 6, 537571) It has the best climate and good water.
('65', 290, 1, 7, 537611) Lady Vithaldas 1
('65', 290, 2, 8, 537628) has been pressing me for it.
('65', 290, 2, 9, 537657) Try her treatment and as Ba would be with you, you will find the going easy.
('65', 290, 2, 10, 537734) If you [decide to] go there you had better send Sumitra here.
('65', 290, 2, 11, 537796) Nimu also would like to come over but if you want to take her with you, by all means do so.
('65', 290, 2, 12, 537888) From all this you will see that I am inclined to keep you away [from me].
('65', 290, 2, 13, 537962) Make up your mind after considering my inclination for what it is worth.
('65', 290, 2, 14, 538035) Don’t leave it to me.
('65', 290, 2, 15, 538057) I do feel that you ought to come away from there.
('65', 290, 2, 16, 538107) You may consult Dr. Jivraj at Bombay if he has the time.
('65', 290, 2, 17, 538164) I would not mind, though, if you don’t.
('65', 290, 2, 18, 538204) You are not going to come to the slightest harm.
('65', 290, 2, 19, 538253) Never mind if you take time to recoup your strength.
('65', 290, 2, 20, 538306) Don’t lose heart.
('65', 290, 2, 21, 538324) Know that I am not at all opposed to your coming here if you like to do so.
('65', 290, 2, 22, 538400) If you do come over I shall of course guide you as best as I can.
('65', 290, 2, 23, 538466) But on the whole I like Mehta’s treatment.
('65', 290, 2, 24, 538509) All you need to have is proper diet.
('65', 290, 2, 25, 538546) The treatment of egg diet might prove beneficial if started early.
('65', 290, 2, 26, 538613) Jugatram writes to say that he knows no vegetable product which can fully replace eggs.
('65', 290, 2, 27, 538701) Milk is inferior to eggs and cannot match them.
('65', 290, 2, 28, 538749) This had been proved right in Manu’s case.
('65', 290, 2, 29, 538792) She was given only uncooked eggs.

('65', 290, 6, 35, 538977) MY DEAR SRIKRISHNA2,
('65', 290, 7, 36, 538998) I have your letter.
('65', 290, 7, 37, 539018) You have become guardian angel to Brijkrishna.
('65', 290, 7, 38, 539065) I quite agree with you that he ought not to tinker with his health.
('65', 290, 7, 39, 539133) I would like him to go back to New Delhi and not leave it till he is completely restored.
('65', 290, 7, 40, 539223) His unsteadiness ruins him.
('65', 290, 7, 41, 539251) I have not heard from him for some time.
('65', 290, 7, 42, 539292) You tell me what he is doing.
('65', 290, 7, 43, 539322) I see that Dr. Ansari is ailing in Hyderabad and therefore can’t be in Delhi for some time.

('65', 291, 8, 14, 539909) Why is there no letter from you?
('65', 291, 8, 15, 539942) I did send a reply 1 asking you to come.
('65', 291, 8, 16, 539983) It was addressed to Hardwar.
('65', 291, 8, 17, 540012) Srikrishna’s letter gives me to understand that you are not well.
('65', 291, 8, 18, 540078) If that is so, the right thing for you would be to return to New Delhi.
('65', 291, 8, 19, 540150) The best thing of course is to follow the doctor’s advice.
('65', 291, 8, 20, 540209) Damodardas met me and we had a long talk but I was not satisfied.
('65', 291, 8, 21, 540275) If what he says is true, either you have misunderstood him or he has changed his statement.

('65', 292, 3, 9, 540800) My solitude is taken in the midst of many.

('65', 292, 7, 15, 541139) November 6, 1934
('65', 292, 8, 16, 541156) MY DEAR MUNSHI,
('65', 292, 9, 17, 541172) My mind is off the constitution now.
('65', 292, 9, 18, 541209) Therefore, it is difficult for me to give you a definite opinion on your letter just received.
('65', 292, 9, 19, 541304) On all the points raised by you, therefore, you should give full effect to that which was clearly understood at the sub committee’s deliberations.
('65', 292, 9, 20, 541451) I sent you my phraseology 1 to meet what I thought was the prevalent view of the sub committee.
('65', 292, 9, 21, 541547) As you know, I was in it the whole of the time, but so was also Kishorelal.
('65', 292, 9, 22, 541623) I would gladly prefer his memory to mine.
('65', 292, 9, 23, 541665) Now for the details: 1. What was understood at the sub committee was that, wherever, whether in rural area or urban area, contiguous places could be combined to form plural member constituencies they should be so combined.
('65', 292, 9, 24, 541888) There was no distinction between the urban area and the rural area except that in the urban area the maximum was fixed at ten members and the minimum at five, wherever such a thing [was] possible; for rural area no maximum or minimum was fixed, but wherever possible, by the process of amalgamation suggested above, plural member constituencies were to be created.
('65', 292, 9, 25, 542253) The question of

('65', 293, 0, 1, 542311) 294 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 293, 1, 2, 542353) amalgamating Ahmedabad, Dhanduka and Prantij does not arise at all in my conception.
('65', 293, 1, 3, 542438) My difficulty arose in your drawing the distinction between the two areas.
('65', 293, 1, 4, 542513) According to our definition of a town, it must have a population of more than l0,000. Any place having 10,000 or less is not a town and belongs to the rural area.
('65', 293, 1, 5, 542676) I do not know if I have made my own meaning clear.
('65', 293, 1, 6, 542727) If it is not clear, and if there is nobody whom you can consult as to the understanding, please enforce your own view.
('65', 293, 1, 7, 542846) After all if there is any difficulty or difference of opinion among the members of A. I. C. C. it can be removed at the next session of the Congress.
('65', 293, 1, 8, 542996) 2. The difficulty for Bombay in the matter of readjusting the proportion of 500 to one delegate was not before me, because it has 21 members allotted to it as the maximum.
('65', 293, 1, 9, 543168) For the other provinces, I understand this to be the position.
('65', 293, 1, 10, 543231) We have the maximum fixed for them and we have also the maximum fixed for urban and rural areas.
('65', 293, 1, 11, 543328) Therefore, the distribution or readjustment will be according to provinces and further readjustment according to the areas in the respective provinces.
('65', 293, 1, 12, 543480) My own interpretation of my draft is that both these are provided for.
('65', 293, 1, 13, 543551) But if you think otherwise, then your draft should stand or any other you may frame to carry out this meaning.
('65', 293, 1, 14, 543662) That the meaning is what I have given here I have no doubt whatsoever.
('65', 293, 1, 15, 543733) 3. As to the special session I have no difficulty.
('65', 293, 1, 16, 543784) The A. I. C. C., the Working Committee and the President will be at the disposal of the delegates.
('65', 293, 1, 17, 543883) They will do whatever they like with them and I thought that our draft had so provided.
('65', 293, 1, 18, 543971) You may send me that final proof if you like, but I waive that privilege, because the publication of the constitution is overdue.
('65', 293, 1, 19, 544101) If we have honestly tried to give effect to the views of the sub committee as adopted by the Subjects Committee, our duty is done and we should stand the fire of criticism.
('65', 293, 1, 20, 544274) I hope you are not overworking yourself.
('65', 293, 1, 21, 544315) I return the draft sent by you.

('65', 294, 4, 8, 544607) What you tell me about the happenings in Lahore makes me sad.
('65', 294, 4, 9, 544669) But I suppose such things are inevitable.
('65', 294, 4, 10, 544711) I will expect you to take only such part in the Congress as is to your liking and as enables you to keep it clean.
('65', 294, 4, 11, 544826) I hope to be able shortly to issue a statement 1 about the Village Industries Association.
('65', 294, 4, 12, 544917) I might have issued it earlier, but, in spite of my getting up at half past two in the morning, I have not yet overtaken the arrears.
('65', 294, 4, 13, 545051) But I shall presently put on speed.
('65', 294, 4, 14, 545087) Of course, I shall want your assistance and that of all solid workers who would come forward.
('65', 294, 4, 15, 545181) The resolution aims at moral uplift.
('65', 294, 4, 16, 545218) Therefore, it includes social work so far as it can be advanced through village industries.
('65', 294, 4, 17, 545310) If Jagannath offers his services and if he is allowed to do so, he will have to be a whole timer.
('65', 294, 4, 18, 545408) Can he be spared by the Society, and has he that inclination himself?

('65', 294, 9, 28, 545821) He will put you among a band of workers.
('65', 294, 9, 29, 545862) Your ultimate destination will be Thana, some miles from Bombay.
('65', 294, 9, 30, 545927) Meanwhile you [ will] be living with the workers in Bombay.
('65', 294, 9, 31, 545987) You will live with them and board with them.
('65', 294, 9, 32, 546032) But if you choose to find your own food, you can begin to draw Rs. 15 per month at once, i.e., from the time Swami Anand takes charge of you.
('65', 294, 9, 33, 546174) Rs. 15 per month will cover your food, clothing, medicine if any and all extras.

('65', 298, 4, 5, 550589) Your letter.
('65', 298, 4, 6, 550602) Amtussalaam is here; she is keeping well and engaged in Ashram work.
('65', 298, 4, 7, 550671) She was to write to you.
('65', 298, 4, 8, 550696) Ramdas is at Sabarmati; Kanu and Sumitra are with him.
('65', 298, 4, 9, 550751) He might come here.
('65', 298, 4, 10, 550771) Nimu is here.
('65', 298, 4, 11, 550785) Sharma writes to say that he would reach here on the 8th.
('65', 298, 4, 12, 550843) Why is Krishna still not well?
('65', 298, 4, 13, 550874) Who is treating her?
('65', 298, 4, 14, 550895) Do you want Sharma to go there?
('65', 298, 4, 15, 550927) Write to me as freely as a daughter to her mother.

('65', 298, 8, 20, 551132) MY DEAR RAFI,
('65', 298, 9, 21, 551146) I have seen your letter to Mahadev.
('65', 298, 9, 22, 551182) Khan Brothers do not like the idea of going anywhere for making speeches.
('65', 298, 9, 23, 551256) They love to go to the villagers and talk to them.
('65', 298, 9, 24, 551307) But at present they are not doing even that.
('65', 298, 9, 25, 551352) Khan Saheb himself is not keeping excellent either.
('65', 298, 9, 26, 551404) You should, therefore, dispense with the Brothers’ visit.
('65', 298, 9, 27, 551462) You have now Sardar in your midst, and you should be more than satisfied.
('65', 298, 9, 28, 551536) But if you must have a Mussalman, why not ask Maulana Saheb to come?
('65', 298, 9, 29, 551605) Your wire.
('65', 298, 9, 30, 551616) What about the Exhibition?
('65', 298, 9, 31, 551643) Will it satisfy my test?

('65', 299, 3, 4, 551859) MY DEAR ASAF ALI,
('65', 299, 4, 5, 551877) I have your telegram.
('65', 299, 4, 6, 551899) The Khan Brothers I find to be of a most retiring nature.
('65', 299, 4, 7, 551957) They are disinclined to go anywhere for making speeches.
('65', 299, 4, 8, 552014) What is the [ use ] then of my pressing them to go any where?
('65', 299, 4, 9, 552076) You should, therefore, do the best you can without them.
('65', 299, 4, 10, 552133) But Dr. Ansari will be presently in your midst though I do not like the idea of his exerting himself in the present state of his weakness.
('65', 299, 4, 11, 552272) Why not ask Maulana Abul Kalam Azad?
('65', 299, 4, 12, 552309) He ought to shoulder this burden and he is an effective speaker.
('65', 299, 4, 13, 552374) I am glad that the atmosphere is clearing for you.
('65', 299, 4, 14, 552425) I do hope that you will succeed.

('65', 299, 15, 28, 552862) MY DEAR JANAMMAL,
('65', 299, 16, 29, 552880) I was glad to hear from you so soon after you reached Madras.
('65', 299, 16, 30, 552942) If you can come quick, it would be good.
('65', 299, 16, 31, 552983) But if you take a fortnight you will come when my movement will be uncertain and I may not be

('65', 300, 1, 3, 553138) Unless, therefore, you come at once it would be perhaps better for you to wait till you know my future programme about which even if I forget Ambujam will write to you as soon as it is settled.
('65', 300, 1, 4, 553332) Did I give you the impression that you were weak minded?
('65', 300, 1, 5, 553389) I might have joked, but you never gave me any reason for thinking that you were weak minded.
('65', 300, 1, 6, 553482) You belong to a family whose members are known not for weakness but strength of mind.
('65', 300, 1, 7, 553568) Ambujam is getting on well, and I think she is perfectly happy here.

('65', 300, 7, 13, 553753) I suppose I should not expect any letter from you.
('65', 300, 7, 14, 553804) I have not written to you, but I frequently think about you.
('65', 300, 7, 15, 553865) I did not at all like your recent behaviour.
('65', 300, 7, 16, 553910) Nor did I like your letter.
('65', 300, 7, 17, 553938) You have tried in it to put up a specious defence of your conduct.
('65', 300, 7, 18, 554005) What have you learnt by accompanying me on my tour for so many months?
('65', 300, 7, 19, 554076) Will you reflect over it and write to me?
('65', 300, 7, 20, 554118) During the Congress session, I saw you going from one end to the other.
('65', 300, 7, 21, 554190) What a dress you were wearing on that day!
('65', 300, 7, 22, 554233) I can’t describe the pain and anger I felt then.
('65', 300, 7, 23, 554282) Now keep your promise.
('65', 300, 7, 24, 554305) Never behave in an unnatural manner.
('65', 300, 7, 25, 554342) Always let yourself be seen as you are.
('65', 300, 7, 26, 554382) They are thinking about your betrothal.
('65', 300, 7, 27, 554422) Express your views frankly on that matter.
('65', 300, 7, 28, 554465) Be truthful always, truthful in thought and speech.
('65', 300, 7, 29, 554517) If this is beyond your strength, leave me.
('65', 300, 7, 30, 554560) I shall wait for a detailed letter from you written in clear handwriting.

('65', 301, 4, 6, 554824) We cannot take it that the ear has been completely cured.
('65', 301, 4, 7, 554882) Give me more details.
('65', 301, 4, 8, 554904) It was fortunate that you went there in time.
('65', 301, 4, 9, 554950) Don’t let there be any burden of work on your mind.
('65', 301, 4, 10, 555002) From the point of view of work, I don’t like your staying in Bombay.
('65', 301, 4, 11, 555071) You must be getting hundreds of visitors.
('65', 301, 4, 12, 555113) Don’t worry about anything whatsoever.
('65', 301, 4, 13, 555152) Don’t think about the Mahila Ashram.
('65', 301, 4, 14, 555189) I am thinking about the problem.
('65', 301, 4, 15, 555222) Radhakrishna also is giving all his time to it.
('65', 301, 4, 16, 555270) I had a discussion with Bhagirathi.
('65', 301, 4, 17, 555306) I will again discuss the matter with her.
('65', 301, 4, 18, 555348) There is no fear of the institution breaking down.
('65', 301, 4, 19, 555399) I am worrying a little about Om.
('65', 301, 4, 20, 555432) Don’t take any step without consulting her.
('65', 301, 4, 21, 555476) A letter to her is enclosed.
('65', 301, 4, 22, 555505) Does the meeting of the Gandhi Seva Sangh fixed for the 27th still stand?
('65', 301, 4, 23, 555579) You may change the date if you wish.
('65', 301, 4, 24, 555616) If you have to stay there longer and if the doctors permit you to leave the place for a week, you may come here and hold the meeting.
('65', 301, 4, 25, 555750) Do you go for walks?
('65', 301, 4, 26, 555771) Are you careful about diet?
('65', 301, 4, 27, 555799) If you have the habit of eating between meals, give it up.
('65', 301, 4, 28, 555858) In digesting such things there is considerable drain on the energy of the brain.
('65', 301, 4, 29, 555939) Open air and exercise are essential.
('65', 301, 4, 30, 555976) I hope you are careful about sleep Ghani, Khan Saheb’s son, wishes to work in your sugar factory.
('65', 301, 4, 31, 556074) I don’t want you to pay him anything at present.
('65', 301, 4, 32, 556123) The idea is merely that he should get some training.
('65', 301, 4, 33, 556176) If it is possible to give him some experience in a factory, it should be done.

('65', 303, 1, 2, 557978) 347. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
('65', 303, 2, 3, 558006) November 8, 1934
('65', 303, 3, 4, 558023) I have seen newspaper paragraphs saying that a Delhi millionaire has placed at my disposal 20 lakhs of rupees for the All India Village Industries Association which is in the process of formation.
('65', 303, 3, 5, 558220) A later Press report makes me select Ahmedabad as the headquarters of the All India Village Industries Association.
('65', 303, 3, 6, 558336) Both these rumours are absolutely without foundation.
('65', 303, 3, 7, 558390) I would like the public to discount news about my movement or intention unless they are authorized by me.
('65', 303, 3, 8, 558496) What is true is that I have promises of Rs. 2,500 per month, and have already received over Rs. 500 in cash.
('65', 303, 3, 9, 558605) Whilst the Association will undoubtedly need funds, it needs workers more than funds.
('65', 303, 3, 10, 558691) The latter will come if the former is assured.
('65', 303, 3, 11, 558738) I, therefore, invite those who would work for the Association to send in their names.
('65', 303, 3, 12, 558824) only those will help who will give some time to the village or who are interested in what may at first sight appear to be uninteresting or unattractive village work.
('65', 303, 3, 13, 558990) The work will be of four kinds: (l) to encourage and improve the known industries that are likely to perish for want of support; (2) to take charge of and sell the products of those industries; (3) to carry on the survey of such village industries as need to be revived and supported; and (4) to attend to village sanitation and hygiene.
('65', 303, 3, 14, 559328) Whist the Association is in the process of formation and the scheme of work is being framed, I would ask fellow workers to set about encouraging hand pounding of rice, grinding of wholewheat meal by village chakkis 1 and popularizing gur 2 and study the processes with a view to ensuring the purity of the products.
('65', 303, 3, 15, 559644) The workers will collect accurate information about these three things and other village industries that may come under their observation and pass on to me such statistics as they may be able to collect.

('65', 304, 1, 2, 559943) I would also like to emphasize the fact that the Association is to be entirely non political.
('65', 304, 1, 3, 560037) Its sole object will be the economic, moral and hygienic uplift of the villages of India and it will be open to workers drawn from all parties.
('65', 304, 1, 4, 560181) The test will be full sympathy with the programme and readiness to help it with money and action wherever possible.

('65', 304, 6, 11, 560393) You promised to give me information about certain points I have mentioned.
('65', 304, 6, 12, 560468) I summarize them below.
('65', 304, 6, 13, 560492) I would like you to answer them as early as it is possible.
('65', 304, 6, 14, 560552) (1) Do you consider that unpolished rice is superior to polished rice from the nutritive standpoint?
('65', 304, 6, 15, 560653) (2) If unpolished rice is better than polished rice, is there any difference between unpolished rice turned out from mills and unpolished rice hand pounded?
('65', 304, 6, 16, 560810) (3) Is there any difference in nutritive value between wholewheat meal stone ground on the indigenous chakki and wholewheat meal ground in the ordinary mills?
('65', 304, 6, 17, 560969) (4) Is gur produced in the village kolus 1 superior to the sugar manufactured in the sugar mills?
('65', 304, 6, 18, 561067) And if it is, what are the contents of gur which make it more desirable and nutritious as an article of food than refined sugar manufactured in the sugar mills?
('65', 304, 6, 19, 561228) (5) Is oil pressed in the village kolus superior to the oil pressed in the oil mills?

('65', 306, 7, 12, 562765) What should be the qualifications of members of Harijan Boards and what should be the number constituting them, are the questions often asked.
('65', 306, 7, 13, 562908) I endeavoured to answer 1 them fairly exhaustively at the meeting of the U. P. Provincial Board in Benares the other day.
('65', 306, 7, 14, 563030) It is necessary, however, to revert to the questions from time to time or till such time as one definite policy has been evolved.
('65', 306, 7, 15, 563160) If we remember that members of these Boards are servants and not patrons, much less ornaments, most of the difficulties will be automatically solved.
('65', 306, 7, 16, 563310) There will then be no question of pleasing or displeasing anybody.
('65', 306, 7, 17, 563377) Only those will be included who are eager to serve the cause and whose presence will promote the usefulness of the Board to which they belong and whose capacity for service will be increased by their being members of a Board.
('65', 306, 7, 18, 563603) No one should allow himself or herself to be a member of a Board, unless he or she (1) believes in the uttermost removal of untouchability, (2) pays something to the Board according to his or her capacity, (3) does some definite Harijan service, e.g., having a Harijan in his or her home as a member of the family, or at least as a domestic servant, or is teaching a Harijan or Harijans, or paying a regular visit to Harijan quarters and cleaning them, or, if he or she is a doctor,

('65', 307, 1, 2, 564224) treating Harijan patients free of charge, etc., (4) sends to the Board a diary containing a record of his or her service from month to month.
('65', 307, 1, 3, 564366) If some such conditions are observed, there need be no restriction on the number of members.
('65', 307, 1, 4, 564459) The more, the merrier.
('65', 307, 1, 5, 564482) Such Boards will meet to take notes; exchange experiences and solve mutual difficulties.
('65', 307, 1, 6, 564571) They will never waste time in fruitless discussions.
('65', 307, 1, 7, 564624) There may be Advisory Committees attached to the Boards.
('65', 307, 1, 8, 564681) These will lay down for themselves some minimum qualifications.
('65', 307, 1, 9, 564745) Naturally the qualifications of advisers will be less stringent than those of members of regular Boards.
('65', 307, 1, 10, 564850) What if members with the qualifications I have described cannot be found is the natural question arising from the bare mention of them.
('65', 307, 1, 11, 564986) I must repeat the answer I have given often enough before now.
('65', 307, 1, 12, 565049) The persons invited by the Central Board to form Sanghs in their own provinces will, in the absence of members having the necessary qualifications, perform the service through agents.
('65', 307, 1, 13, 565233) ‘Act True’ must be the motto of every Harijan Board, and there should never be any departure from the wholesome maxim.

('65', 307, 3, 15, 565372) 353. MR. SUPPOSED INCONSISTENCY
('65', 307, 4, 16, 565404) The Editor has sent the following 1 received by him for answer:
('65', 307, 5, 17, 565468) In the Harijan of the 9th March Gandhiji is reported to have said that ‘there was no warrant in the Shastras for untouchability’ 2 .
('65', 307, 5, 18, 565601) [This] does not seem to accord with his previous statement, which was that there is such sanction but he did not accept the authority of such passages because they were immoral.
('65', 307, 5, 19, 565779) Will you kindly explain the apparent inconsistency, through the columns of the Harijan?
('65', 307, 5, 20, 565867) I make no hobgoblin of consistency.
('65', 307, 5, 21, 565903) If I am true to myself from moment to moment, I do not mind all the inconsistencies that may be flung in my face.
('65', 307, 5, 22, 566017) But in the letter quoted, there is no inconsistency.
('65', 307, 5, 23, 566070) If I reject certain texts in the Shastras as interpolations or inconsistent with the fundamental principles they lay down or with universal morality, surely, I am entitled to say that there is no warrant in the Shastras for the practice or belief that the objectionable texts
('65', 307, 6, 24, 566346) 1 Only extracts are reproduced here.

('65', 308, 1, 2, 566491) prescribe.
('65', 308, 1, 3, 566502) I have quoted the opinion of not one but several learned men in support of the contention that the Shastras do not enjoin untouchabilily as it is practised today.
('65', 308, 1, 4, 566665) Of course, there is untouchability in the Shastras, but it is all curable in accordance with the simple methods prescribed by them.
('65', 308, 1, 5, 566797) We all become untouchables every day when we attend to natural functions, and our untouchability is cured by simple ablutions.
('65', 308, 1, 6, 566924) Indeed, even wicked thoughts make us untouchable, but we are cured by resisting them and purifying ourselves by taking the name of God as Rama or Vasudev or Narayan or Shiva and invoking His never failing protection.
('65', 308, 1, 7, 567141) Even so is a Harijan, whose occupation may render him untouchable, cured by prescribed purification.
('65', 308, 1, 8, 567242) And certain sanatanists claim that there is an incurable untouchability which is handed down from father to son for generations and which will live to the end of Time.
('65', 308, 1, 9, 567410) And what is the saddest of all is that the sanatanists claim that such untouchables are to be counted by the million.
('65', 308, 1, 10, 567528) Their warrant for the belief in the existence of several million untouchables is not a Shastra, but census reports, which change from time to time and which are prepared by a host of enumerators who have no knowledge of the Hindu Shastras and, in numerous cases.
('65', 308, 1, 11, 567791) are not themselves Hindus.
('65', 308, 1, 12, 567818) It is thus a superstitious belief against which every lover of Hinduism should rise in rebellion.

('65', 308, 3, 14, 567935) 354. RIGHT OF MINORITY
('65', 308, 4, 15, 567958) A sanatanist asks:
('65', 308, 5, 16, 567977) As a sanatanist I have a difficulty about temple entry by Harijans.
('65', 308, 5, 17, 568045) Supposing among temple goers of a particular temple there is a majority of 99 to I in favour of Harijans entering the temple and the temple is opened.
('65', 308, 5, 18, 568196) What about the minority of one who has objection to worshipping in a temple visited by Harijans?
('65', 308, 5, 19, 568293) If reformers have their way, will it not be an undue interference with the right of worship which belongs to the sanatanists from time immemorial?
('65', 308, 5, 20, 568440) There may be a public church of the Roman Catholics as well as a public church of Protestants in an English town.
('65', 308, 5, 21, 568554) Even if the Protestants be in a majority, they would not interfere with the conduct of affairs in the Roman Catholic church.
('65', 308, 5, 22, 568679) Why, then, should the reformers (even though in the majority) interfere with the conduct of affairs in a public temple belonging to the sanatanists?
('65', 308, 5, 23, 568828) I should answer the questions by putting another.
('65', 308, 5, 24, 568878) If the one solitary sanatanist has the right, as he undoubtedly has, what about the
('65', 309, 0, 1, 568962) 310 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 309, 1, 2, 569004) majority?
('65', 309, 1, 3, 569014) Have they no rights?
('65', 309, 1, 4, 569035) The parallel quoted does not apply.
('65', 309, 1, 5, 569071) The questioner has imagined the existence side by side of two churches belonging to different denominations.
('65', 309, 1, 6, 569180) It would be a monstrous impertinence on the part of Protestants to interfere with the rights of Roman Catholics or vice versa.
('65', 309, 1, 7, 569307) But suppose all the Protestants but one decided to admit to their temple persons whom they had excommunicated for ages.
('65', 309, 1, 8, 569427) Surely, they would have every right to lift the ban.
('65', 309, 1, 9, 569480) Here there would be no question of changing one’s religion, as there is in the case imagined by the questioner.
('65', 309, 1, 10, 569592) In the temple entry movement, reformers do not seek to alter their faith.
('65', 309, 1, 11, 569666) If they did, in theory at least, not even a unanimous decision of temple goers of a temple should entitle them to use a temple for purposes never intended by the founders.
('65', 309, 1, 12, 569838) Here the reformers claim that the faith they profess in common with the sanatanists permits the use of their temples by fellow Hindus, the Harijans.
('65', 309, 1, 13, 569987) It is, therefore, a question of interpretation, and in such matters, the opinion of a majority must prevail.
('65', 309, 1, 14, 570096) If it did not, it would amount to the coercion of a majority by a minority, and there would be an end to all progress.
('65', 309, 1, 15, 570215) Indeed, the doctrine the questioner propounds would mean decay and death to a society that subscribes to it.
('65', 309, 1, 16, 570324) It should be remembered that the minority is free to build a temple for itself.
('65', 309, 1, 17, 570404) And so far as I am concerned, I have given my opinion that even a minority of one should have its prejudices so far respected that a special hour may be set apart so as to enable it to offer worship free from the intrusion, whether of reformers or of Harijans.

('65', 312, 10, 26, 575199) When the time comes for our reviewing the situation, if the life of the Harijan has to be prolonged and if the discharge of the Rs. 84 12 0 bill is of any material help to us in keeping that alive, we can take the amount of the bill from them.
('65', 312, 10, 27, 575443) Otherwise the money
('65', 313, 0, 1, 575463) 314 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 313, 1, 2, 575505) should be written off as if the printing of the Supplement was done in the usual course.
('65', 313, 1, 3, 575594) I know that I held a different view at one time; but I am overborne by the consideration that so long as we can make the two ends meet, even including this bill, we should not fall back upon the central fund.
('65', 313, 1, 4, 575803) After all we are drawing upon that fund for a part of Sastri’s emolument.
('65', 313, 1, 5, 575877) You have asked for a return of Thakkar Bapa’s letters to you.
('65', 313, 1, 6, 575939) Here they are.
('65', 313, 1, 7, 575954) I was incidentally discussing your general affairs with him and I can give you this assurance that he has no irritation against you.
('65', 313, 1, 8, 576087) What he feels is that you overrate your ability to do things and that you are generous at the expense of your trust.
('65', 313, 1, 9, 576204) As for instance, he related to me the story of outdoor boys whom you are training and for whom you are providing afternoon refreshments although it is no part of your job to do so and although the boys who come are not so poor as not to afford one or two pice for refreshments.
('65', 313, 1, 10, 576482) This story was told him by one who is in sympathy with you and your work and who appreciates your self sacrifice.
('65', 313, 1, 11, 576596) Thakkar Bapa did not mention this with any sense of injustice; but he simply.
('65', 313, 1, 12, 576674) gave an instance of your generous nature.
('65', 313, 1, 13, 576716) Generosity is a virtue when we exercise it at our own expense; it is a vice when we exercise it at the expense of the trust that might have been given to us.
('65', 313, 1, 14, 576874) A trustee has to take the role of a miser in regard to his trust.

('65', 313, 5, 19, 577034) KANTI, 1 got your letter.
('65', 313, 5, 20, 577060) May the New Year prove fruitful for your body, mind and soul.
('65', 313, 5, 21, 577122) Four hundred rounds is certainly not the average speed of spinning on the takli.
('65', 313, 5, 22, 577203) Bhau and others have reached that figure and are trying to go still farther.
('65', 313, 5, 23, 577280) Two hundred rounds has become the average speed.
('65', 313, 5, 24, 577329) One hundred and sixty should be reckoned as the minimum.
('65', 313, 5, 25, 577386) Harilal’s reformation so far seems to be permanent.
('65', 313, 5, 26, 577438) Narandas seems to be satisfied.
('65', 313, 5, 27, 577470) Do continue milk and ghee.
('65', 313, 5, 28, 577497) My health has become excellent now.
('65', 313, 5, 29, 577533) These days I take only

('65', 314, 1, 3, 577686) They include cucumber, radishes, luni leaves, tomatoes, etc.
('65', 314, 1, 4, 577747) My weight was taken only today and it was found to be 107_ lb.
('65', 314, 1, 5, 577810) This is very good improvement indeed.
('65', 314, 1, 6, 577848) Ramdas and Ba are expected to return tomorrow.
('65', 314, 1, 7, 577895) Kishorelal and Gomati arrived yesterday.
('65', 314, 1, 8, 577936) Other arrivals and departures continue, as usual.
('65', 314, 1, 9, 577986) Have you received the money now?
('65', 314, 1, 10, 578019) Have you heard that Kanu is here and that Prithuraj is starting business?
('65', 314, 1, 11, 578093) Jivandas also has started business.

('65', 314, 3, 13, 578155) Mahadev will return today from Bombay.
('65', 314, 3, 14, 578194) Bablo was operated upon for tonsils.
('65', 314, 3, 15, 578231) Jamnalal has not yet fully recovered and is obliged to remain in Bombay for the present.

('65', 314, 8, 19, 578444) I got your letter just now and so am able to reply to it.
('65', 314, 8, 20, 578502) You have done quite well in deciding that the delivery should take place in Guleria.
('65', 314, 8, 21, 578587) Look after everything there very carefully.
('65', 314, 8, 22, 578631) I hope you are keeping quite well.
('65', 314, 8, 23, 578666) Do you get dry fruits there?
('65', 314, 8, 24, 578695) Do you get good quality milk?

('65', 315, 1, 2, 578989) 364. INTERVIEW TO NIRMAL KUMAR BOSE1
('65', 315, 2, 3, 579026) November 9/10, 1934 2
('65', 315, 3, 4, 579048) QUESTION: .
('65', 315, 3, 5, 579060) Should khadi be merely a sort of humanitarian work or should we use it chiefly as an instrument of political education?
('65', 315, 3, 6, 579180) Our experience has been that unless the ultimate objective is kept clearly in mind, it degenerates easily into a work of no significance.
('65', 315, 3, 7, 579318) ANSWER: The two issues of khadi and political organization should be kept absolutely separate.
('65', 315, 3, 8, 579413) There must be no confusion.
('65', 315, 3, 9, 579441) The aim of khadi is humanitarian; but so far as India is concerned, its effect is bound to be immensely political.
('65', 315, 3, 10, 579556) The Salvation Army wants to teach people about God.
('65', 315, 3, 11, 579608) But they come with bread.
('65', 315, 3, 12, 579634) For the poor bread is their God.
('65', 315, 3, 13, 579667) Similarly we should bring food into the mouths of the people through khadi.
('65', 315, 3, 14, 579743) If we succeed in breaking the idleness of the people through khadi, they will begin to listen to us.
('65', 315, 3, 15, 579844) Whatever else the Government might do, it does leave some food for the villagers.
('65', 315, 3, 16, 579926) Unless we can bring food to them, why should the people listen to us?
('65', 315, 3, 17, 579996) When we have taught them what they can do through their own efforts, then they will want to listen to us.
('65', 315, 3, 18, 580102) That trust can best be generated through khadi.
('65', 315, 3, 19, 580150) While working out the khadi programme our aim should be purely humanitarian, that is, economic.
('65', 315, 3, 20, 580246) We should leave out all political considerations whatsoever.
('65', 315, 3, 21, 580307) But it is bound to produce important political consequences which nobody can prevent and nobody need deplore.
('65', 315, 4, 22, 580417) Q. Could we not start small battles on local and specific issues against capitalism in the villages and use them as a means of strengthening the people or bringing about a sense of co operation among them, in preference to the khadi method?
('65', 315, 4, 23, 580658) When we have a choice between the two, which should we prefer?
('65', 315, 4, 24, 580721) If we have to sacrifice all the work that we have built up in the villages in connection with khadi while fighting against the moneylender or the landed proprietor, for, say, a reduction in the rate of interest or increase in the share of agricultural produce, then what shall we do—provided the latter is more liable to evoke self confidence among the villagers than the khadi method of organization?
('65', 315, 4, 25, 581123) A. It is a big proviso you have added at the end of the question.
('65', 315, 4, 26, 581189) I cannot say if fights on local and specific issues against capitalists are more likely to generate the kind of determination and courage needed in a non violent campaign.
('65', 315, 4, 27, 581361) But if I concede you that point, then khadi

('65', 316, 1, 2, 581598) would have to be sacrificed under the circumstances you quote.
('65', 316, 1, 3, 581661) As a practical man, claiming to be an expert in non violent methods, I should advise you not to go in for that type of work in order to train the masses in self consciousness and attainment of power.
('65', 316, 1, 4, 581861) We are fighting for swaraj in the non violent way.
('65', 316, 1, 5, 581912) If many workers in different parts of India engage in local battles of the sort you describe, then, in times of necessity, people all over India will not be able to make a common cause in a fight for swaraj.
('65', 316, 1, 6, 582120) Before civil disobedience can be practised on a vast scale, people must learn the art of civil or voluntary obedience.
('65', 316, 1, 7, 582239) Our obedience to the Government is through fear; and the reaction against it is either violence itself or that species of it, which is cowardice.
('65', 316, 1, 8, 582385) But through khadi we teach people the art of civil obedience to an institution which they have built up for themselves.
('65', 316, 1, 9, 582505) Only when they have learnt that art can they successfully disobey something which they want to destroy in the non violent way.
('65', 316, 1, 10, 582632) This is why I should advise all workers not to fritter their fighting strength in many sided battles, but to concentrate on peaceful khadi work in order to educate the masses into a condition necessary for a successful practice of non violent non co operation.
('65', 316, 1, 11, 582893) With their own exploitation, boycott of foreign cloth through picketing may easily be violent; through the use of khadi it is most natural and absolutely non violent.
('65', 316, 2, 12, 583060) Q. Is love or non violence compatible.
('65', 316, 2, 13, 583099) with possession or exploitation in any shape or form?
('65', 316, 2, 14, 583153) If possession and non violence cannot go together, then do you advocate the maintenance of private ownership of land or factories at an unavoidable evil which will continue so long as individuals are not ripe or educated enough to do without it?
('65', 316, 2, 15, 583399) If it be such a step, would it not be better to own all the land through the State and place the State under the control of the masses?
('65', 316, 3, 16, 583535) A. Love and exclusive possession can never go together.
('65', 316, 3, 17, 583591) Theoretically when there is perfect love, there must be perfect non possession.
('65', 316, 3, 18, 583671) The body is our last possession.
('65', 316, 3, 19, 583704) So a man can only exercise perfect love and be completely dispossessed, if he is prepared to embrace death and renounce his body for the sake of human service.
('65', 316, 3, 20, 583864) But that is true in theory only.
('65', 316, 3, 21, 583897) In actual life, we can hardly exercise perfect love, for the body as a possession will always remain with us.
('65', 316, 3, 22, 584007) Man will ever remain imperfect, and it will always be his part to try to be perfect.
('65', 316, 3, 23, 584092) So that perfection in love or non possession will remain an unattainable ideal, as long as we are alive, but towards which we must ceaselessly strive.
('65', 317, 0, 1, 584243) 318 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 317, 1, 2, 584285) Those who own money now are asked to behave like trustees holding their riches on behalf of the poor.
('65', 317, 1, 3, 584387) You may say that trusteeship is a legal fiction.
('65', 317, 1, 4, 584436) But if people meditate over it constantly and try to act up to it, then life on earth would be governed far more by love than it is at present.
('65', 317, 1, 5, 584580) Absolute trusteeship is an abstraction like Euclid’s definition of a point, and is equally unattainable.
('65', 317, 1, 6, 584685) But if we strive for it, we shall be able to go further in realizing a state of equality on earth than by any other method.
('65', 317, 2, 7, 584809) Q. If you say that private possession is incompatible with non violence, why do you put up with it?
('65', 317, 3, 8, 584909) A. That is a concession one has to make to those who earn money but who would not voluntarily use their earnings for the benefit of mankind.
('65', 317, 4, 9, 585050) Q. Why then not have State ownership in place of private property and thus minimize violence?
('65', 317, 4, 10, 585144) A. It is better than private ownership.
('65', 317, 4, 11, 585184) But that too is objectionable on the ground of violence.
('65', 317, 4, 12, 585241) It is my firm conviction that if the State suppressed capitalism by violence, it will be caught in the coils of violence itself, and will fail to develop nonviolence at any time.
('65', 317, 4, 13, 585420) The State represents violence in a concentrated and organized form.
('65', 317, 4, 14, 585488) The individual has a soul, but as the State is a soulless machine, it can never be weaned from violence to which it owes its very existence.
('65', 317, 4, 15, 585629) Hence I prefer the doctrine of trusteeship.
('65', 317, 5, 16, 585673) Q. Let us come to a specific instance.
('65', 317, 5, 17, 585712) Supposing an artist leaves certain pictures to a son who does not appreciate their value for the nation and sells them or wastes them, so that the nation stands to lose something precious through one person’s folly.
('65', 317, 5, 18, 585928) If you are assured that the son would never be a trustee in the sense in which you would like him to be, do you not think the State would be justified in taking away those things from him with the minimum use of violence?
('65', 317, 5, 19, 586150) A. Yes, the State will, as a matter of fact, take away those things, and I believe it will be justified if it uses the minimum of violence.
('65', 317, 5, 20, 586290) But the fear is always there that the State may use too much violence against those who differ from it.
('65', 317, 5, 21, 586394) I would be very happy indeed if the people concerned behaved as trustees; but if they fail, I believe we shall have to deprive them of their possessions through the State with the minimum exercise of violence.
('65', 317, 5, 22, 586604) That is why I said 1 at the Round Table Conference that every vested interest must be subjected to scrutiny, and confiscation ordered where necessary with or without compensation as the case demanded.
('65', 317, 6, 23, 586805) 1 Vide “Extract from proceedings of the federal structure committee meeting”, 19 11 1931.
('65', 318, 0, 1, 586895) VOL.65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 319
('65', 318, 1, 2, 586945) What I would personally prefer would be not a centralization of power in the hands of the State, but.
('65', 318, 1, 3, 587047) an extension of the sense of trusteeship; as in my opinion the violence of private ownership is less injurious than the violence of the State.
('65', 318, 1, 4, 587190) However, if it is unavoidable, I would support a minimum of State ownership.
('65', 318, 2, 5, 587267) Q. Then, sir, shall we take it that the fundamental difference between you and the Socialists is that you believe that men live more by self direction or will than by habit, and they believe that men live more by habit than by will; that being the reason why do you strive for self correction while they try to build up a system under which men will find it impossible to exercise their desire for exploiting others?
('65', 318, 3, 6, 587684) A. While admitting that man actually lives by habit, I hold that it is better for him to live by the exercise of will.
('65', 318, 3, 7, 587803) I also believe that men are capable of developing their will to an extent that will reduce exploitation to a minimum.
('65', 318, 3, 8, 587921) I look upon an increase of the power of the State with the greatest fear, because although while apparently doing good by minimizing exploitation, it does the greatest harm to mankind by destroying individuality, which lies at the root of all progress.
('65', 318, 3, 9, 588174) We know of so many cases where men have adopted trusteeship, but none where the State has really lived for the poor.
('65', 318, 4, 10, 588291) Q. But have not those cases of trusteeship which you sometimes cite been due to your personal influence rather than to anything else?
('65', 318, 4, 11, 588425) Teachers like you come infrequently.
('65', 318, 4, 12, 588462) Would it not be better, therefore, to trust to some organization to effect the necessary changes in man, rather than depend upon the casual advent of men like yourself?
('65', 318, 5, 13, 588631) A. Leaving me aside, you must remember that the influence of all great teachers of mankind has outlived their lives.
('65', 318, 5, 14, 588748) In the teachings of each prophet like Mohammed, Buddha or Jesus, there was a permanent portion and there was another which was suited to the needs and requirements of the times.
('65', 318, 5, 15, 588926) It is only because we try to keep up the permanent with the impermanent aspects of their teachings that there is so much distortion in religious practice today.
('65', 318, 5, 16, 589087) But that apart, you can see that the influence of these men has sustained us after they have passed away.
('65', 318, 5, 17, 589193) Moreover, what I disapprove of is an organization based on force which a State is.
('65', 318, 5, 18, 589276) Voluntary organization there must be.
('65', 318, 6, 19, 589314) Q. What then, sir, is your ideal social order?
('65', 318, 6, 20, 589361) A. I believe that every man is born in the world with certain natural tendencies.
('65', 318, 6, 21, 589443) Every person is born with certain definite limitations which he cannot overcome.
('65', 318, 6, 22, 589524) From a careful observation of those limitations the law of varna was deduced.
('65', 318, 6, 23, 589602) It establishes certain
('65', 319, 0, 1, 589625) 320 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 319, 1, 2, 589667) spheres of action of certain people with certain tendencies.
('65', 319, 1, 3, 589728) This avoided all unworthy competition.
('65', 319, 1, 4, 589767) Whilst, recognizing limitations, the law of ‘varna’ admitted of no distinctions of high and low, on the one hand it guaranteed to each the fruits of his labours and on the other it prevented him from pressing upon his neighbour.
('65', 319, 1, 5, 589996) This great law has been degraded and [has] fallen into disrepute.
('65', 319, 1, 6, 590062) But my conviction is that an ideal social order will only be evolved when the implications of this law are fully understood and given effect to.
('65', 319, 2, 7, 590207) Q. Do you not think that in ancient India there was much difference in economic status and social privileges between the four varnas?
('65', 319, 2, 8, 590341) A. That may be historically true.
('65', 319, 2, 9, 590375) But misapplication or an imperfect understanding of the law must not lead to the ignoring of the law itself.
('65', 319, 2, 10, 590484) By constant striving we have to enrich the inheritance left to us.
('65', 319, 2, 11, 590551) This law determines the duties of man.
('65', 319, 2, 12, 590590) Rights follow from a due performance of duties.
('65', 319, 2, 13, 590638) It is the fashion nowadays to ignore duties and assert or rather usurp rights.
('65', 319, 3, 14, 590717) Q. If you are so keen upon reviving varnashrama, why do you not favour violence as the quickest means?
('65', 319, 3, 15, 590820) A. Surely the question does not arise.
('65', 319, 3, 16, 590859) Definition and performance of duties rule out violence altogether.
('65', 319, 3, 17, 590926) Violence becomes imperative when an attempt is made to assert rights without reference to duties.
('65', 319, 4, 18, 591024) Q. Should we not confine our pursuit of Truth to ourselves and not press it upon the world because we know that it is ultimately limited in character?

('65', 319, 7, 23, 591399) November 10, 1934
('65', 319, 8, 24, 591417) DEAR FRIEND,
('65', 319, 9, 25, 591430) Gita and other scriptures you quote undoubtedly discounte nance ignorant crucifixion of the body.
('65', 319, 9, 26, 591528) But all insist upon selfrestraint and sacrifice.
('65', 319, 9, 27, 591577) These necessarily include fasting
('65', 319, 10, 28, 591611) 1 The source reproduced this from The Modem Review.
('65', 319, 10, 29, 591663) 2 On this the addressee has recorded: “This is a rejoinder to my criticism against ‘fast, and the khadi clause in the Congress constitution.”
('65', 320, 0, 1, 591805) VOL.65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 321
('65', 320, 1, 2, 591855) undertaken with deliberation and discretion.
('65', 320, 1, 3, 591900) With reference to your second letter, you have to refer to the Secretary of the Working Committee of the Congress for an authentic opinion.
('65', 320, 1, 4, 592040) In my opinion, the difficulty that you have to face is common to all.
('65', 320, 1, 5, 592110) But I do not understand your difficulty at all.
('65', 320, 1, 6, 592158) The primary members are not required to be habitual wearers of khaddar, but primary members who want to be elected as members of Committee have to be habitual wearers of khaddar.
('65', 320, 1, 7, 592337) If they want to qualify, they can begin to wear khaddar as a habit, and in six months’ time they will be fully qualified candidates.

('65', 320, 4, 11, 592648) MY DEAR SURESH, I have your letter.
('65', 320, 4, 12, 592684) I do wish you to get on well.
('65', 320, 4, 13, 592714) I have sent you messages through Prafulla.
('65', 320, 4, 14, 592757) One thing I want to emphasize.
('65', 320, 4, 15, 592788) Just as a prisoner has no right to think of the world outside the prison walls, much less to form any opinion about what he may hear of events taking place outside his little universe of the jail, so also should a sick person lying on his bed cease to apply his mind to problems of the world outside the sick room.
('65', 320, 4, 16, 593103) He is no longer taking an active part in those events; he honestly becomes unfit to give a correct judgment.
('65', 320, 4, 17, 593212) This is also the ideal put before the sannyasi.
('65', 320, 4, 18, 593260) Immediately a man takes sannyasa he is supposed to cut himself off from the day to day activities of the world.
('65', 320, 4, 19, 593372) If these very simple obvious facts of life were borne in mind we should be spared so much misery, misunderstanding and so many errors; and prisoners, sick people and sannyasis would lead peaceful lives and do justice to their respective stations.
('65', 320, 4, 20, 593619) If you are not in pain, I would like you to do one thing: that is, to write out the medical chapters for Satisbabu’s book.
('65', 320, 4, 21, 593742) I want a good guide for village workers.
('65', 320, 4, 22, 593783) The conception is to produce a book after Moore’s Family Medicine or Everybody His Own Doctor.

('65', 321, 3, 7, 594180) Khan Saheb does not keep anybody with him.
('65', 321, 3, 8, 594223) You should, therefore, create an atmosphere of purity yourself around you, and this you can do by contemplating pure writings of authors of unimpeachable purity as for instance the Gita, Ramayana of Tulsidas, portions of Mahabharata, etc.

('65', 321, 9, 17, 594831) I can’t give you any guidance just now.
('65', 321, 9, 18, 594871) But I would like you to keep me in touch with your activities.
('65', 321, 9, 19, 594934) Follow the development of the Association which is in the process of formation, and I would like you also to confer with Satisbabu and give him such assistance as you can in his Harijan work which he has got to develop being in control of the all Bengal work.
('65', 321, 9, 20, 595194) This might enable you to support some of your co workers, fully or in part.

('65', 322, 10, 16, 595937) You are not still fully cured.
('65', 322, 10, 17, 595968) Gaurishankar had been trying nature cure.
('65', 322, 10, 18, 596010) Did it not bring you any result?
('65', 322, 10, 19, 596043) From my observation I am convinced more and more each day that it is worth giving it a trial.
('65', 322, 10, 20, 596137) It is an unexplored area.

('65', 322, 16, 29, 596461) I have no intention of touring in connection with the All India Village Industries Association just being formed.
('65', 322, 16, 30, 596575) You will glean from the papers what I am doing.
('65', 322, 16, 31, 596623) By this time you should know that I have ceased to be even a primary member of the Congress.
('65', 323, 0, 1, 596716) 324 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 323, 1, 2, 596758) I never knew that there was a movement in Andhradesh against Hindi prachar 1. But I would myself resist any attempt to displace the rich vernaculars of the different provinces.
('65', 323, 1, 3, 596935) Hindi is not intended to take their place, but it is intended to supplement them as a medium of inter provincial intercourse.
('65', 323, 1, 4, 597061) Therefore, Hindi propaganda should not only not interfere with the progress of vernaculars, but it must enrich them.

('65', 323, 4, 11, 597463) You would have seen the brief statement I had issued.
('65', 323, 4, 12, 597517) Nevertheless I send you a copy for ready reference.
('65', 323, 4, 13, 597569) It represents an outline of my mind’s working.

('65', 323, 4, 18, 597934) That will enable us to save our time at the time of discussion.
('65', 323, 4, 19, 597998) I am sure you realize one fundamental fact.
('65', 323, 4, 20, 598042) What applies to America and England does not necessarily apply to India.
('65', 323, 4, 21, 598115) India has in her teeming millions so many superfluous days that she does not need to free the energy of her sons for superior or more remunerative work through highly developed machinery.
('65', 323, 4, 22, 598303) In her 350 million children she has so many living ready made machines, and if she can utilize their labour, half of which is running to waste, the double starvation of the body and the mind will cease.
('65', 323, 4, 23, 598506) That is the problem that faced me when I returned to India in 1915, and has haunted me ever since.

('65', 324, 12, 22, 599542) He does want to get all right without having to go there.
('65', 324, 12, 23, 599600) All the same if you can secure a permit do send it.
('65', 324, 12, 24, 599652) If you cannot, tell me so plainly.

('65', 324, 12, 27, 599802) Ramdas and Ba arrived yesterday.
('65', 324, 12, 28, 599835) Ramdas has returned a mere skeleton.

('65', 325, 6, 23, 601032) Visitors must be stopped.
('65', 325, 6, 24, 601058) You must not tax and tire your brain.
('65', 325, 6, 25, 601096) If necessary, you should take a vow of silence for that purpose.
('65', 325, 6, 26, 601161) You may talk only about matters connected with the doctor, or with attendants about your needs.

('65', 326, 6, 13, 602386) BHAI RAJENDRA PRASAD,
('65', 326, 7, 14, 602408) I have your letter but not the copy of the one you addressed to Dr. Roy.
('65', 326, 7, 15, 602481) I do not feel like expressing an opinion but to withhold it too does not now seem right.
('65', 326, 7, 16, 602570) In my opinion no action should be taken for the present.
('65', 326, 7, 17, 602627) Let there be fresh elections to the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee.
('65', 326, 7, 18, 602701) After they are over we may see what we can do.
('65', 326, 7, 19, 602748) If the decision already taken is just and fair, making changes simply on account of the agitation in Bengal does not seem right.
('65', 326, 7, 20, 602877) But then please do whatever you think right.
('65', 326, 7, 21, 602922) In that case, my opinion need not be given any weight.
('65', 326, 7, 22, 602977) I do not feel I am obliged to make any alteration in what has been submitted in respect of Suresh.
('65', 326, 7, 23, 603076) Get back your health and come here soon.

('65', 327, 2, 3, 603360) [Before November 12, 1934] 1
('65', 327, 3, 4, 603389) BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS,
('65', 327, 4, 5, 603408) Your two letters are lying in front of me.
('65', 327, 4, 6, 603451) Regarding rice I have myself observed that only polished rice is available here.
('65', 327, 4, 7, 603532) A rice mill owner himself informed me that people preferred polished rice.
('65', 327, 4, 8, 603607) Anyway enquire in Calcutta and let me know.
('65', 327, 4, 9, 603651) You say that from the economic point of view our vote ought to be cast in favour of mortar and pestle.
('65', 327, 4, 10, 603754) But how?
('65', 327, 4, 11, 603763) It only means, doesn’t it, that the villager will save some money?
('65', 327, 4, 12, 603830) Tell me if it implies anything more.
('65', 327, 4, 13, 603867) Write to me after considering the cases of sugar and jaggery from both the viewpoints.
('65', 327, 4, 14, 603954) What interest will you take in this new institution 2 and have you thought of offering it any aid?
('65', 327, 4, 15, 604053) Would you in that case make some possible changes in your life?
('65', 327, 4, 16, 604117) You must be aware of Rameshwardas’s decision in this regard.
('65', 327, 4, 17, 604178) How is Gajanan?
('65', 327, 4, 18, 604194) What about your operation?
('65', 327, 4, 19, 604221) You must decide one way or the other.
('65', 327, 4, 20, 604259) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] I shall be here till the end of this month, if not longer.
('65', 327, 4, 21, 604344) After that I intend to write about Utmanzai.

('65', 327, 7, 24, 604461) November 12, 1934
('65', 327, 8, 25, 604479) DEAR MOTIBABU,
('65', 327, 9, 26, 604494) I have your long letter and the enclosures.
('65', 327, 9, 27, 604538) About the letter from All India Spinners’ Association I need say nothing as I expect to hear from you again.
('65', 327, 9, 28, 604647) With reference to the letter from Saratbabu, I have always held the opinion that there is no contradiction between real beauty and truth.
('65', 327, 9, 29, 604785) Therefore, truth is always beautiful.

('65', 328, 1, 2, 604975) Truth, therefore, in my opinion, is the whole of art.
('65', 328, 1, 3, 605029) Art divorced from truth is no art, and beauty divorced from truth is utter ugliness.
('65', 328, 1, 4, 605114) That in this world many ugly things pass for beauty is too true.
('65', 328, 1, 5, 605179) That happens because we do not always appreciate truth.
('65', 328, 1, 6, 605235) I hope you are keeping well.
('65', 328, 1, 7, 605264) You will follow the fortunes of the All India Village Industries Association and take what part you can in it.
('65', 328, 1, 8, 605375) Please pass on all the suggestions you like.
('65', 328, 2, 9, 605420) Yours sincerely.

('65', 328, 13, 24, 605900) I have sent letters to the doctors.
('65', 328, 13, 25, 605936) Jayaprakash seems to be ill.
('65', 328, 13, 26, 605965) He wants Prabhavati to go to Ahmednagar.
('65', 328, 13, 27, 606006) If she goes, it is best from the point of view of the Ashram that she should go just now.

('65', 329, 5, 7, 606448) November 12, 1934 2
('65', 329, 6, 8, 606468) SHARMA,
('65', 329, 7, 9, 606476) I could understand what you say in your letter.
('65', 329, 7, 10, 606524) It is written in a plain straightforward manner but it is full of your ignorance.
('65', 329, 7, 11, 606606) If you go to England you must acquire a degree and it takes a minimum of seven years to attain a genuine degree and in no case less than five years.
('65', 329, 7, 12, 606755) And all that you will get will be what you could have achieved here itself.
('65', 329, 7, 13, 606831) You have made a grave allegation against British educated as well as Indian educated doctors.
('65', 329, 7, 14, 606925) At present there are doctors of both the types who perform the work of a Bhangi and feel no shame in that.
('65', 329, 7, 15, 607032) Rupees 3, 000 is not enough these days for seven years.
('65', 329, 7, 16, 607088) You should have at least Rs. 30,000. And Rs. 60,000 if you take Draupadi along with you.
('65', 329, 7, 17, 607177) This is the minimum sum needed for seven years.
('65', 329, 7, 18, 607225) In spite of my simple living it cost me Rs. 13,000 for three years.
('65', 329, 7, 19, 607293) And the cost of living has now doubled.
('65', 329, 7, 20, 607333) But the consideration of money may be looked upon as secondary.
('65', 329, 7, 21, 607397) I am strongly opposed to the very idea of going to England.
('65', 329, 7, 22, 607457) Going to England might be proper only after one has acquired a basic knowledge of one’s subject.
('65', 329, 7, 23, 607554) I have no doubt that the basic knowledge can be easily acquired in India itself.
('65', 329, 7, 24, 607635) The notion of going to England is simply mistaken and must be put an end to.
('65', 329, 7, 25, 607712) If you think that you are not in error you may rebel against me and go in dependently without my blessings.
('65', 329, 7, 26, 607820) You have the
('65', 329, 8, 27, 607833) 1 Omission as in the source.
('65', 329, 8, 28, 607862) Clarifying this letter Pyarelal wrote another letter to the addressee the same day which read: “Bapuji has written to you today in connection with Prabhavati.
('65', 329, 8, 29, 608021) What he meant to say was that if Jayaprakash wanted to call over Prabhavati to Bombay and if you agreed she could leave for Bombay with Vinobaji’s permission after hearing from you.
('65', 329, 8, 30, 608203) But this was not so in the case of going to Ahmednagar.
('65', 329, 8, 31, 608259) If his letter conveys a different meaning it needs to be corrected.
('65', 329, 8, 32, 608327) His intention is exactly what I have written to you.” 2 The printed source, however, has “12 12 34”.

('65', 330, 1, 3, 608509) A revolt is proved right only by its success.
('65', 330, 1, 4, 608555) I too had defied my brother, who was like a father to me, for thirteen years.
('65', 330, 1, 5, 608633) It was successful because it proved to be morally correct.
('65', 330, 1, 6, 608692) You too may take recourse to defiance if you so wish.
('65', 330, 1, 7, 608746) If you would listen to me do as I say.
('65', 330, 1, 8, 608785) Stay on here for the time being.
('65', 330, 1, 9, 608818) Study anatomy and physiology.
('65', 330, 1, 10, 608848) I can get the doctor here to help you.
('65', 330, 1, 11, 608887) Do whatever work I may assign to you.
('65', 330, 1, 12, 608925) You may if you wish send for Draupadi.
('65', 330, 1, 13, 608964) I can arrange for some accommodation.
('65', 330, 1, 14, 609002) I too don’t like Draupadi’s absence from your side.
('65', 330, 1, 15, 609054) You may take it that your knowledge of physiology is very imperfect, almost nil.
('65', 330, 1, 16, 609135) The love of study needed for this, I find, is lacking in you.
('65', 330, 1, 17, 609197) Tell me if I am mistaken.
('65', 330, 1, 18, 609223) If you do not like my proximity you may live at a place of your own choosing and be content with correspondence.
('65', 330, 1, 19, 609336) But if it comes to that I will take it to mean lack of forbearance in you.
('65', 330, 1, 20, 609411) 1 know those who cannot live with me.
('65', 330, 1, 21, 609449) You are not one of those nor should you ever be.
('65', 330, 1, 22, 609498) Ask me if all this is not clear.
('65', 330, 1, 23, 609531) Try to understand it well.
('65', 330, 1, 24, 609558) I return your letter so that you may not have to prepare a copy.

('65', 334, 6, 11, 614005) ANSARI,
('65', 334, 7, 12, 614013) It was a great effort for me to resist the temptation to respond to your telegram as you would have liked me to do.
('65', 334, 7, 13, 614129) But I felt that I must not respond.
('65', 334, 7, 14, 614165) I resisted the temptation elsewhere also.
('65', 334, 7, 15, 614207) I hope, therefore, that you will forgive me.

('65', 334, 14, 23, 614446) I have got the papers about the prize.
('65', 334, 14, 24, 614485) 1 The very first condition is this: “The spinning wheel should be handy in size and should be worked by hand or by foot in an ordinary Indian village cottage.” The other two conditions that are also worth considering are these: “The machine should be such as can be made available in India at a price not exceeding Rs. 150.” “The construction of the machine should be substantial and capable of being used, say, 20 years, with occasional replacement of

('65', 335, 6, 11, 615380) Khan Saheb has seen it.
('65', 335, 6, 12, 615404) He likes the programme.
('65', 335, 6, 13, 615428) The second part should not be thought of before the first has been tried and [has] succeeded.
('65', 335, 6, 14, 615522) But he cannot be in Calcutta by the 25th.
('65', 335, 6, 15, 615564) He has to keep an engagement in Lucknow for the 1st December.
('65', 335, 6, 16, 615626) His daughter is coming here on the 22nd from England.
('65', 335, 6, 17, 615680) He has to fix up something about his son who is studying in Dehra Dun and who will meet him at the end of the month.
('65', 335, 6, 18, 615797) Therefore he won’t be ready to start from here before the 7th or 8th of December.
('65', 335, 6, 19, 615879) I hope that won’t matter.

('65', 338, 7, 23, 620208) MY DEAR SHANKERLAL,
('65', 338, 8, 24, 620228) I have gone through the papers in connection with the prize competition.
('65', 338, 8, 25, 620301) Without prejudice to his right to get the prize on fulfilling the conditions laid down, it strikes me that the machine seems to be otherwise useful.
('65', 338, 8, 26, 620450) We might ask Kirloskar Brothers to let us buy some machines so as to enable us to experiment on them and find out by experience their workability, also defects if any, and determine finally whether we can declare the machine as the prize winner or whether we can, without giving the prize, provide a market for the machine.
('65', 338, 8, 27, 620774) From all the descriptions I have received of the machine it appears to me to be complicated and too unworkable to win the prize.
('65', 338, 8, 28, 620903) But we might be able to make use of the machine in

('65', 339, 1, 3, 621125) We might also by making extensive experiments find out whether the yarn is equal to the mill yarn from the point of view of weavers.
('65', 339, 1, 4, 621258) If you think that this may be done, I would send for a representative of Kirloskar Brothers and talk to him unless you think that the time is not ripe for such conversation or that if the conversations are carried on they should be carried on by you.
('65', 339, 1, 5, 621509) Kirloskar Brothers did write to me offering to send a machine and Sjt.

('65', 339, 1, 7, 621626) I send you a copy of my reply 1 to them.

('65', 339, 7, 16, 622157) Have you inquired about the difference in nutritive value between unpolished rice from the mills and unpolished rice pounded by the hand?

('65', 339, 7, 18, 622364) What use do you make of the husk?
('65', 339, 7, 19, 622398) What is the daily wage earned for husking for eight hours and the wage for spinning for the same time in the same area?
('65', 339, 7, 20, 622518) What is the difference between the price of mill husked rice and that of hand husked rice?
('65', 339, 7, 21, 622609) Is there any difference in the quantity eaten by rice eaters of mill husked rice and hand husked rice?
('65', 339, 7, 22, 622712) Is this activity self supporting?

('65', 346, 3, 4, 629747) DEAR FRIEND,
('65', 346, 4, 5, 629760) His Excellency has probably seen the public statement 1 I have made of my intention to visit the Frontier Province as soon as possible consistently with my preoccupations.
('65', 346, 4, 6, 629932) I am likely to be free after the middle of December.
('65', 346, 4, 7, 629985) My object in wishing to visit the Frontier Province is to be with its people, to know them at first hand and to understand how far the teaching of non violence by Khan Saheb Abdul Ghaffar Khan has permeated his followers.
('65', 346, 4, 8, 630207) It is also my intention to help them in the development of their village industries.
('65', 346, 4, 9, 630292) I need hardly say that I have no desire whatsoever to inculcate among the Frontier people the spirit of disobedience (civil or otherwise) of authority.
('65', 346, 4, 10, 630444) Though I know that there is no legal bar against my entering the Frontier Province, I have no desire to do anything that may bring me in conflict with the Government.
('65', 346, 4, 11, 630611) It is my earnest effort to avoid such conflict in so far as it is humanly possible.
('65', 346, 4, 12, 630695) Will you kindly ascertain His Excellency’s wishes in the matter and let me know them?

('65', 347, 4, 7, 631749) Whatever is possible and desirable shall be done on the publication of the Joint Committee’s Report 1. I have not yet sent my letter about Utmanzai 2. It is cooking itself, but pressure of work serves as a good excuse for putting it off.
('65', 347, 4, 8, 631987) If I don’t write a separate letter to C. F. Andrews you please give him my love and tell him I have received his letter.
('65', 347, 4, 9, 632108) I endorse his plan about coming here on a flying visit.

('65', 349, 5, 7, 634929) He had no intention of immediately returning to active politics, but it certainly did not mean retirement for the present, he explained, in guiding the new Village Industries Organization, in solving the Hindu Moslem problem, and continuing the campaign against untouchability.
('65', 349, 5, 8, 635207) He said: All these movements will be non political in the narrow sense of the term.
('65', 349, 6, 9, 635291) [C.] Supposing that the Joint Committee’s report gives even less than the White Paper, what will be your reaction to it?
('65', 349, 7, 10, 635412) He was quite prepared to believe that the forecast was correct, but did not seem willing to commit himself.
('65', 349, 7, 11, 635520) He contrasted the procedure actually followed by the British Government in regard to the reforms with that outlined by Mr. MacDonald in the House of Commons soon after the termination of the second session of the Round Table Conference.
('65', 349, 7, 12, 635757) 2 The Prime Minister had spoken of a settlement with India’s representatives (though, Mr. Gandhi pointed out with emphasis, the Round Table delegates were only nominees of the British Government) to be initialled by both parties, and that settlement would then be the basis of Parliamentary legislation.
('65', 349, 8, 13, 636061) [C.] The same thing had happened in Ireland.
('65', 349, 8, 14, 636106) [G.] Yes, the Irish parallel does hold good—but not just yet.
('65', 349, 9, 15, 636168) At this point, I drew his attention to a recent statement by General Smuts in Britain.
('65', 349, 9, 16, 636255) General Smuts had said that it was an act of faith on the part of the British to have conferred self government on South Africa, and a similar act of faith in regard to India would, in his view, be justified by subsequent results.
('65', 349, 10, 17, 636486) 1 In the introductory paragraph the correspondent states that the interview began after Gandhiji signed the letters seeking assistance from “experts” to become advisers of the All India Village Industries Association.

('65', 350, 1, 2, 636821) [G.] I was in South Africa at the time and can see no similarity between the two cases.
('65', 350, 1, 3, 636909) In the case of the Boers, it was not an act of faith, but making a virtue of necessity.
('65', 350, 2, 4, 636997) [C.] How ?
('65', 350, 2, 5, 637008) [G.] The Boer War was a virtual defeat for the British.
('65', 350, 2, 6, 637064) They were sick and weary of the fight, and their resources were getting exhausted.
('65', 350, 2, 7, 637147) of course, as an Imperial Power, they could have carried it on; but the tide was rising fast in favour of Campbell Bannerman.
('65', 350, 2, 8, 637273) King Edward’s instructions to Lord Milner were to conciliate the Boers.
('65', 350, 2, 9, 637345) I will grant that whatever was done was done not grudging]y but handsomely.
('65', 350, 3, 10, 637421) [C.] And so ?
('65', 350, 3, 11, 637435) [G.] And so, I go back to the statement 1 I made some weeks ago to the Con,ress in Bombay—that is, no constitutional agitation will ever achieve freedom for a country.
('65', 350, 4, 12, 637603) Nothing was ever gained that way, according to his reading of French or British history, and he had put that point to Lord Lothian and a few others with whom he had discussed the Indian problem at oxford three years ago.
('65', 350, 5, 13, 637824) Mr. Gandhi made it clear beyond doubt that his conviction was that Britain would never grant to India self government of the kind South Africa enjoys today so long as she has “nothing to act upon”.
('65', 350, 5, 14, 638022) She does not feel that civil resistance has been successful; there is a sense of exultation that the movement has been paralysed.
('65', 350, 6, 15, 638152) Pursuing the point further, I asked him whether apart from the circumstances under which self government was granted to South Africa (and which do not, according to him, exist in India), the contents of that measure would satisfy him—in other words, what is the independence he aims at?
('65', 350, 6, 16, 638439) He did not seem disposed to discuss the question in detail.
('65', 350, 6, 17, 638499) But he said the goal, for him, was defined in the concluding portion of his statement 2 at the second Round Table Conference; if membership of the British Common.
('65', 350, 6, 18, 638662) wealth was forced upon India, he would resist it; but if it was voluntary partnership, terminable at will, he would have no objection to such an association.
('65', 350, 6, 19, 638820) So far as he was concerned, it was the statement of an “eternal position”.
('65', 350, 7, 20, 638895) But at present he is “ immersed” in the building up of the Village Industries Organization.
('65', 350, 7, 21, 638987) His recent walking tour through the villages in connection with the

('65', 351, 1, 2, 639238) anti untouchability campaign was a revelation to him.
('65', 351, 1, 3, 639292) The village people seemed to him “inert and despondent’,.
('65', 351, 1, 4, 639350) Their poverty stricken conditions have been making “a more and more forcible appeal”.
('65', 351, 1, 5, 639436) The revival of village industries would infuse life into occupations that are now dying out.
('65', 351, 1, 6, 639529) He remarked Uninteresting it may be for some people, but it will be most solid work.
('65', 351, 2, 7, 639614) He is visualizing to himself the 700,000 villages of India, and his ambition is to spread out his workers in as many as possible.
('65', 351, 3, 8, 639744) Spinning, on which he has set his heart for many years, he confessed, is the lowest paid of rural occupations.
('65', 351, 3, 9, 639855) But that will not come under the new organization, since it is being directed by the All India Spinners, Association More food for the villagers—and food of the right kind—is his principal aim.
('65', 351, 3, 10, 640049) He makes no secret of his intention to start a campaign against mill polished rice and mill ground wheat.
('65', 351, 3, 11, 640155) In this, he said, some distinguished research workers in diet problems agree with him.
('65', 351, 3, 12, 640242) He will also encourage the use of coarse sugar (gur) as against the factory refined article.
('65', 351, 3, 13, 640335) He will also give rural sanitation and hygiene a prominent place in his programme.
('65', 351, 3, 14, 640418) [G.] Again, there must be no exploitation of the movement either by politicians or by anyone else—not even in a distant fashion.

('65', 352, 1, 2, 641159) that love will be remembered, not only by the millions of Harijans, but by the many more millions of caste Hindus—indeed by the whole of India.
('65', 352, 1, 3, 641303) Lalaji was a great humanitarian, and his humanitarianism covered the whole of humanity.
('65', 352, 1, 4, 641391) Each succeeding anniversary should make Lalaji live more truly in our lives than the previous.
('65', 352, 1, 5, 641486) Death for reformers like Lala Lajpat Rai is mere dissolution of the body.
('65', 352, 1, 6, 641560) Their work and their ideas do not die with the body.
('65', 352, 1, 7, 641613) Their power grows with time.
('65', 352, 1, 8, 641642) We feel it mare, as with the march of time it is seen outside of its setting in the weak flesh.
('65', 352, 1, 9, 641738) The impermanent in man dies with him.
('65', 352, 1, 10, 641776) The permanent part of him triumphs over the ashes and appears clearer to us for their removal.
('65', 352, 1, 11, 641871) Let us cherish Lalaji’s memory in that light and let Harijan Hindus and caste Hindus make a fresh resolve in Lalaji’s memory to cleanse society of the curse of untouchability—the former by ridding themselves of the defects arising out of their suppression, and the latter by shedding the sin of the feeling of superiority, which belief in natal untouchability implies.

('65', 352, 3, 13, 642260) 421. VILLAGE INDUSTRIES
('65', 352, 4, 14, 642284) As the author of the Congress resolutions 1 on village industries and as the sole guide of the Association that is being formed for their promotion, it is but meet that I should, as far as possible, share with the public the ideas that are uppermost in my mind regarding these industries and the moral and hygienic uplift that is intimately associated with them.
('65', 352, 4, 15, 642647) The idea of forming the Association took definite shape during the Harijan tour as early as when I entered Malabar.
('65', 352, 4, 16, 642763) A casual talk with a khadi worker showed to me how necessary it was to have a body that would make an honest attempt to return to the villagers what has been cruelly and thoughtlessly snatched away from them by the city dwellers.
('65', 352, 4, 17, 642993) The hardest hit among the villagers are the Harijans.
('65', 352, 4, 18, 643047) They have but a limited choice of the industries that are open to the villagers in general.
('65', 352, 4, 19, 643139) Therefore, when their industries slip away from their hands, they become like the beasts of burden with whom their lot

('65', 353, 1, 2, 643371) is cast.
('65', 353, 1, 3, 643380) Let the doubting reader peruse Prof.
('65', 353, 1, 4, 643417) Malkani’s article reproduced elsewhere 1 and he will realize the truth of my statement.
('65', 353, 1, 5, 643505) But the villagers in general are not much better off today.
('65', 353, 1, 6, 643565) Bit by bit they are being confined only to the hand to mouth business of scratching the earth.
('65', 353, 1, 7, 643660) Few know today that agriculture in the small and irregular holdings of India is not a paying proposition.
('65', 353, 1, 8, 643766) The villagers live a lifeless life.
('65', 353, 1, 9, 643802) Their life is a process of slow starvation.
('65', 353, 1, 10, 643846) They are burdened with debts.
('65', 353, 1, 11, 643876) The moneylender lends, because he can do no otherwise.
('65', 353, 1, 12, 643931) He will lose all if he does not.
('65', 353, 1, 13, 643964) This system of village lending baffles investigation.
('65', 353, 1, 14, 644018) our knowledge of it is superficial, in spite of elaborate inquiries.
('65', 353, 1, 15, 644087) Extinction of village industries would complete the ruin of the 7,00,000 villages of India.
('65', 353, 1, 16, 644179) I have seen in the daily Press criticism of the proposals I have adumbrated.
('65', 353, 1, 17, 644256) Advice has been given to me that I must look for salvation in the direction of using the powers of nature that the inventive brain of man has brought under subjection.
('65', 353, 1, 18, 644424) The critics say that water, air, oil and electricity should be fully uti lized as they are being utilized in the go ahead West.
('65', 353, 1, 19, 644552) They say that control over these hidden powers of nature enables every American to have 33 slaves.
('65', 353, 1, 20, 644651) Repeat the process in India and I dare say that it will thirty three times enslave every inhabitant of this land, instead of giving everyone thirty three slaves.
('65', 353, 1, 21, 644813) Mechanization is good when the hands are too few for the work intended to be accomplished.
('65', 353, 1, 22, 644904) It is an evil when there are more hands than required for the work, as is the case in India.
('65', 353, 1, 23, 644997) I may not use a plough for digging a few square yards of a plot of land.
('65', 353, 1, 24, 645070) The problem with us is not how to find leisure for the teeming millions inhabiting our villages.
('65', 353, 1, 25, 645167) The problem is how to utilize their idle hours, which are equal to the working days of six months in the year.
('65', 353, 1, 26, 645278) Strange as it may appear, every mill generally is a menace to the villagers.
('65', 353, 1, 27, 645355) I have not worked out the figures, but I am quite safe in saying that every mill hand does the work of at least ten labourers doing the same work in their villages.
('65', 353, 1, 28, 645520) In other words he earns more than he did in his village at the expense of ten fellow villagers.
('65', 353, 1, 29, 645616) Thus spinning and weaving

('65', 354, 1, 2, 645782) mills have deprived the villagers of a substantial means of livelihood.
('65', 354, 1, 3, 645854) It is no answer in reply to say that they turn out cheaper, better cloth, if they do so at all.
('65', 354, 1, 4, 645950) For, if they have displaced thousands of workers, the cheapest mill cloth is dearer than the dearest khadi woven in the villages.
('65', 354, 1, 5, 646080) Coal is not dear for the coal miner who can use it there and then, nor is khadi dear for the villager who manufactures his own khadi.
('65', 354, 1, 6, 646214) But if the cloth manufactured in mills displaces village hands, rice mills and flour mills not only displace thousands of poor women workers, but damage the health of the whole population in the bargain.
('65', 354, 1, 7, 646418) Where people have no objection to taking flesh diet and can afford it, white flour and polished rice may do no harm, but in India, where millions can get no flesh diet even where they have no objection to eating it, it they can get it, it is sinful to deprive them of nutritious and vital elements contained in whole wheat meal and unpolished rice.
('65', 354, 1, 8, 646767) It is time medical men and others combined to instruct the people on the danger attendant upon the use of white flour and polished rice.
('65', 354, 1, 9, 646904) I have drawn attention to some broad glaring facts to show that the way to take work to the villagers is not through mechanization but that it lies through revival of the industries they have hitherto followed.
('65', 354, 1, 10, 647115) Hence the function of the All India Village Industries Associ ation must, in my opinion, be to encourage the existing industries and to revive, where it is possible and desirable, the dying or dead industries of villages according to the village methods, i.e., the villagers working in their own cottages as they have done from times immemorial.
('65', 354, 1, 11, 647461) These simple methods can be considerably improved as they have been in hand ginning, hand carding, hand spinning and hand weaving.
('65', 354, 1, 12, 647592) A critic objects that the ancient plan is purely individualistic and can never bring about corporate effort.
('65', 354, 1, 13, 647701) This view appears to me to be very superficial.
('65', 354, 1, 14, 647749) Though articles may be manufactured by villagers in their cottages, they can be pooled together and profits divided.
('65', 354, 1, 15, 647866) The villagers may work under supervision and according to plan.
('65', 354, 1, 16, 647930) The raw material may be supplied from common stock.
('65', 354, 1, 17, 647982) If the will to co operative effort is created, there is surely ample opportunity for co operation, division of labour, saving of time and efficiency of work.
('65', 354, 1, 18, 648140) All these things are today being done by the All India Spinners’ Association in over 5,000 villages.
('65', 355, 0, 1, 648241) 356 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 355, 1, 2, 648283) But khadi is the sun of the village solar system.
('65', 355, 1, 3, 648333) The planets are the various industries which can support khadi in return for the heat and the sustenance they derive from it.
('65', 355, 1, 4, 648459) Without it, the other industries cannot grow.
('65', 355, 1, 5, 648505) But during my last tour I discovered that, without the revival of the other industries, khadi could not make further progress.
('65', 355, 1, 6, 648632) For villagers to be able to occupy their spare time profitably, the village life must be touched at all points.
('65', 355, 1, 7, 648744) That is what the two Associations are expected to do.
('65', 355, 1, 8, 648798) Naturally they can have nothing to do with politics or political parties.
('65', 355, 1, 9, 648872) The Congress, in my opinion, did well in making both the Associations autonomous and wholly non political.
('65', 355, 1, 10, 648979) All parties and all communities can combine to uplift the villages economically, morally and hygienically.
('65', 355, 1, 11, 649086) I know that there is a school of thought that does not regard khadi as an economic proposition at all.
('65', 355, 1, 12, 649189) I hope that they will not be scared by my having mentioned khadi as the centre of village activities.
('65', 355, 1, 13, 649291) I could not complete the picture of my mind without showing the inter relation between khadi and the other village industries.
('65', 355, 1, 14, 649418) Those who do not see it are welcome only to concentrate their effort on the other industries.
('65', 355, 1, 15, 649512) But this, too, they will be able to do through the new Association, if they appreciate the background I have endeavoured to give in this article.

('65', 359, 12, 21, 654839) (4) Is gur produced in the village kolus superior to the sugar manufactured in the sugar mills?

('65', 361, 11, 18, 656617) Just now I have an offer from the Servants of India Branch in Nagpur of full co operation in the village industries work.
('65', 361, 11, 19, 656739) I do not know how far this will materialize.
('65', 361, 11, 20, 656784) But the offer is full hearted and I shall make the most of it if we agree when the time for execution comes.

('65', 361, 11, 22, 656964) I do not know how far the movement for return to the village chakki and the rice husking mill and the like appeals to you.
('65', 361, 11, 23, 657087) This is merely to share my thoughts with you and to tell you how I long for your co operation at some point of my many activities.
('65', 361, 11, 24, 657218) And yet I want nothing from you that does not command the full approval of your reason.
('65', 361, 11, 25, 657306) You are too true to act otherwise than in accordance with your reason.

('65', 362, 6, 8, 657627) DEAR MANZAR ALI,
('65', 362, 7, 9, 657644) My postcard and your letter have crossed each other.
('65', 362, 7, 10, 657697) Very strange!
('65', 362, 7, 11, 657711) I never dreamt that you had prompted Sundarlal.
('65', 362, 7, 12, 657759) Do I not know his effusiveness?
('65', 362, 7, 13, 657791) His letter gave me the impression that he also offered his services together with yours.
('65', 362, 7, 14, 657880) So I told him that I have no faith in either of you doing plodding manual work, but that if my fear was proved to be baseless I should be delighted.
('65', 362, 7, 15, 658029) In reply he wrote saying that he had never any intention of offering his services.
('65', 362, 7, 16, 658112) He simply wanted to come if it was so required to facilitate your approach.
('65', 362, 7, 17, 658188) So I wrote to you the postcard which I hope you received.
('65', 362, 7, 18, 658246) I sent it care of Uma Nehru not knowing your Unao address.
('65', 362, 7, 19, 658305) If you will do plodding work without being fatigued, I would be delighted to inspan you and if you feel the need to come here to understand what is required you can come.
('65', 362, 7, 20, 658476) If, however, you have understood the thing, begin operations at once as many have done on reading my statement 2. In the four things I have suggested I have given an ample preliminary preliminary which, if it was taken up enthusiastically,

('65', 362, 8, 23, 658953) To my unaided mind, you appear to be opening the first campaign of an endless and quixotic war against modern civilization.
('65', 362, 8, 24, 659077) Long ago you proclaimed yourself its sleepless enemy, and now you would, if you could, turn it back on the course it has pursued for several millennia.
('65', 362, 8, 25, 659229) I reel at the mere thought.

('65', 370, 2, 3, 667630) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, I see from your three letters that you have not got a clear picture of the Village Industries Association in your mind.
('65', 370, 2, 4, 667768) The idea behind it is that we should exclusively buy from villages whatever articles they can produce.
('65', 370, 2, 5, 667871) We can thereby repay a little of the debt that we owe to them.
('65', 370, 2, 6, 667934) Whether or not we shall be able to do this is another matter.
('65', 370, 2, 7, 667996) We need not proceed on the supposition that we shall not.
('65', 370, 2, 8, 668054) What was started by only six or seven of us has now spread all over the country.
('65', 370, 2, 9, 668135) If it is our duty to do what I am suggesting, then all of us should use pens, ink, knives, soap, jaggery and sugar manufactured in villages and flour and rice ground or milled in villages.
('65', 370, 2, 10, 668324) I have mentioned these things only as examples.
('65', 370, 2, 11, 668372) Maybe we shall not carry out this idea in respect of many of the things enumerated; if, however, we believe that it is our moral duty to use such articles, we shall be putting crores of rupees into the pockets of villagers and the importance of villages will increase.
('65', 370, 2, 12, 668641) only then shall we be able to establish the swaraj of our dreams, devoted to the welfare of villages, and only then will it be non violent swaraj.
('65', 370, 2, 13, 668788) All other things can be deduced from this.
('65', 370, 2, 14, 668831) The Association can function only if it gets five or six full time workers.
('65', 370, 2, 15, 668907) We are trying to attract for it some Congress minded persons who are not regular Congressmen.
('65', 370, 2, 16, 669001) of course some of the workers will have to be Congressmen.
('65', 370, 2, 17, 669060) I am trying to persuade Jairamdas, hoping that Rajendrababu and you will be able to spare him and that he will agree to be released.
('65', 370, 2, 18, 669193) If he cannot do this work, he will be of no service.
('65', 370, 2, 19, 669246) I am discussing the same problem with Khan Saheb.
('65', 370, 2, 20, 669296) I don’t know what Jalbhai’s attitude will be.
('65', 370, 2, 21, 669342) If he refuses, I intend to invite Khurshed.
('65', 370, 2, 22, 669386) Such at any rate are my dreams.
('65', 370, 2, 23, 669418) I am indifferent whether or not they are realized.
('65', 370, 2, 24, 669469) They help to preserve my peace of mind.
('65', 370, 2, 25, 669509) If you are now free please come over.
('65', 370, 2, 26, 669547) The treatment of your nose must get priority, of course.
('65', 370, 2, 27, 669604) How many workers from Gujarat may I engage in this work?
('65', 370, 2, 28, 669661) Raojibhai has written to me and expressed his willingness.
('65', 370, 2, 29, 669720) I have replied to him saying that, even if he can be free, he can come only if permitted by you.

('65', 373, 4, 8, 672240) I asked Radhakisan and learnt from him about a less expensive place as an alternative to the garden at Wardha 1. I think it will do.

('65', 373, 11, 20, 672756) I of course had read it.
('65', 373, 11, 21, 672781) All of us feel that your figures are exaggerated.
('65', 373, 11, 22, 672831) You state that foreign cloth costs four annas a yard, swadeshi three annas a yard and that khadi is even cheaper than that.
('65', 373, 11, 23, 672955) How can that be?
('65', 373, 11, 24, 672972) Think over this.
('65', 373, 11, 25, 672989) Moreover, you say that khadi is more durable.
('65', 373, 11, 26, 673035) Is this true?
('65', 373, 11, 27, 673049) Also, is it true that foreign cloth is less durable than the swadeshi mill cloth?

('65', 374, 3, 4, 673319) BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS,
('65', 374, 4, 5, 673338) I have your letter.
('65', 374, 4, 6, 673358) How can I say what I need?
('65', 374, 4, 7, 673385) Whenever there is a question of a hundred or two or a thousand I ask you for it.
('65', 374, 4, 8, 673466) But by taking up the huge work of village industries I have increased my own commitments.
('65', 374, 4, 9, 673556) Thus I can only say that you may give me whatever is left after making other essential donations.
('65', 374, 4, 10, 673654) The formation of a board for village industries is presenting some difficulties.
('65', 374, 4, 11, 673735) I want the board to be very small, to consist of a minimum of three members and a maximum of ten.
('65', 374, 4, 12, 673833) I want men who have full faith in its aims and can devote more or less their full time to it.
('65', 374, 4, 13, 673927) And this precisely is giving me some trouble.
('65', 374, 4, 14, 673973) Have you any ideas in this respect ?
('65', 374, 4, 15, 674010) Do you know Rajkumari Amrit Kaur?

('65', 375, 6, 12, 675298) November 20, 1934
('65', 375, 7, 13, 675316) BHAI MAVALANKAR,
('65', 375, 8, 14, 675333) You cannot be permitted to engage yourself exclusively in minting money.
('65', 375, 8, 15, 675406) I hope you will agree to shoulder the burden of the Harijan Ashram and the dairy.
('65', 375, 8, 16, 675488) We must find the expenses of the Harijan Ashram and of Harijan work in Gujarat from Gujarat itself.
('65', 375, 8, 17, 675588) I am sure in my mind that the burden of begging this sum should not have to be borne by Sardar.
('65', 375, 8, 18, 675684) He will contribute something voluntarily, but refuses to put himself to trouble on that account.
('65', 375, 8, 19, 675781) My purpose in inviting you, Ranchhodlal and Shankerlal is that either all of you should pay the expenses or beg for them.
('65', 375, 8, 20, 675903) I hope you will not want me to beg from outside Gujarat.
('65', 375, 8, 21, 675960) And, besides, how far can I be depended upon?
('65', 375, 8, 22, 676006) Before long you and I will know where I am.
('65', 375, 8, 23, 676050) Please, therefore, spare some time from the business of money making and give a little of it to Harijan work and a little to the service of the cow.
('65', 375, 8, 24, 676199) If, however, my guess is wrong and if at present you cannot spare a single moment for philanthropic work from the task of earning money to pay off your debt, in case you are in debt, tell me frankly and I will not then pester you.
('65', 375, 8, 25, 676430) I have now reached my 66th year making people work beyond their capacity.
('65', 375, 8, 26, 676504) How can the old hardened habit leave completely, although I have now grown somewhat indifferent ?
('65', 375, 8, 27, 676602) I am leaving the Congress, yielding to the feeling that no one should work

('65', 376, 1, 3, 676852) To achieve this I must stop wielding my pen and resort to silence or I must work only through our journals.
('65', 376, 1, 4, 676960) But I am not yet powerful enough to work in this manner.

('65', 377, 7, 15, 679310) I want a band of persons who would devote themselves and their time purely to the work, move about and would go to the villages and try progressively to supply their own needs through the villages unlike as we do now.
('65', 377, 7, 16, 679528) I see that I must not expect these things from you and must therefore deny myself the privilege of your close association.

('65', 378, 4, 5, 680377) I have your letter.
('65', 378, 4, 6, 680397) Students can help by visiting villages in their neighbourhood and studying the industries of those villages, by doing sanitation work themselves, by organizing the industries which they can easily handle, and by using such articles as are manufactured in their villages in the place of articles turned out in cities.
('65', 378, 4, 7, 680714) I cannot contemplate degeneration prevailing in the Congress ranks, nor have I the slightest feeling that, if it sets in, I can prevent it.

('65', 380, 2, 3, 682743) November 21, 1934
('65', 380, 3, 4, 682761) NARANDAS,
('65', 380, 4, 5, 682771) I hope you have returned after inspecting the dairy.
('65', 380, 4, 6, 682824) A letter for Harilal is enclosed.
('65', 380, 4, 7, 682858) 1 Read it and pass it on to him.
('65', 380, 4, 8, 682891) Give him a room in the school if you can spare one.
('65', 380, 4, 9, 682943) Give him enough to meet his needs.
('65', 380, 4, 10, 682978) We cannot pay more than Rs. 50 a month just now.
('65', 380, 4, 11, 683027) By and by we want to accustom him to living within even less than that.
('65', 380, 4, 12, 683099) It is not necessary that he should save anything for repaying his debts.
('65', 380, 4, 13, 683172) If he overcomes his weakness of mind and you feel that he can be trusted, we will pay off his debts.
('65', 380, 4, 14, 683273) But that will be after some time.
('65', 380, 4, 15, 683307) What has been done about his eyes and teeth?
('65', 380, 4, 16, 683352) N. 2 has turned out to be a worthless woman.
('65', 380, 4, 17, 683397) She was begging for help from all sorts of people in Bombay.
('65', 380, 4, 18, 683458) V She had set herself up as a public worker.
('65', 380, 4, 19, 683503) I didn’t like her ways at all.
('65', 380, 4, 20, 683534) L. 3 has done the same.
('65', 380, 4, 21, 683558) There was nothing but show in the whole thing.
('65', 380, 4, 22, 683605) L.’s aspirations are quite high.
('65', 380, 4, 23, 683638) But she is unsteady and has a good measure of pride too.
('65', 380, 4, 24, 683695) She lacks strength of mind to keep her word.
('65', 380, 4, 25, 683740) She is always full of plans.
('65', 380, 4, 26, 683769) Now she is eager to stay on here for a month or so.
('65', 380, 4, 27, 683821) I have categorically refused my consent.
('65', 380, 4, 28, 683862) She will leave this place on the 7th at the latest and go to Bombay.
('65', 380, 4, 29, 683931) I shall be here for this month at any rate.
('65', 380, 4, 30, 683975) I don’t know what will happen after that.
('65', 380, 5, 31, 684017) Blessings from BAPU

('65', 382, 3, 4, 685628) MY DEAR SHIVA RAO,
('65', 382, 4, 5, 685647) I have your letter and a copy of the Madras Mail.
('65', 382, 4, 6, 685697) I will return the paper to you after I have read it.
('65', 382, 4, 7, 685750) I think you know the scope of the Association and the v method of achieving its object.
('65', 382, 4, 8, 685838) Would you care to serve on the Central Board?
('65', 382, 4, 9, 685884) If you will, have you got a living belief in the formula underlying the object, namely, that we must go to the villages in search of all the articles of daily use, and not make villages look to the cities for the supply of such articles?
('65', 382, 4, 10, 686122) That is to say, do you recognize the necessity, so far as it is possible, of eliminating the city factories and mills which are fast displacing the village industries, and supplying the daily wants of the villagers thereby confining 90 per cent of the population of India to bare agriculture?
('65', 382, 4, 11, 686415) Do you consider the realization of this object worthy of your making it the main business of your life, and will you give the Board most of your time?
('65', 382, 4, 12, 686566) If you will, I would like you to serve on the Board.
('65', 382, 4, 13, 686619) The idea that we are evolving is to make the Board as small as possible, consistent with its efficient working, and to make it consist of practically whole timers.
('65', 382, 4, 14, 686783) Will you please wire your reply to this letter?

('65', 382, 10, 20, 686947) MY DEAR AGATHA,
('65', 382, 11, 21, 686963) It was quite like you to have put your whole soul into sending little Mehrtaj to Brindisi.
('65', 382, 11, 22, 687054) 1 It was a fine contribution to Indo British
('65', 382, 12, 23, 687099) 1 At the top of the letter the addressee has noted: “The Frontier Gandhi’s daughter Mehrtaj was in London with her aunt.
('65', 382, 12, 24, 687220) She was to travel from Brindisi with Mirabehn.
('65', 382, 12, 25, 687267) Mehrtaj lost her passport just before she was due to sail.
('65', 382, 12, 26, 687326) I went to the India office and asked their swift help in securing another one.” (G.N. 1481)

('65', 383, 1, 4, 687522) The more I see them, the more I love them.
('65', 383, 1, 5, 687565) And inasmuch [as] you have done this little and yet great thing for them, you have done it for all India.
('65', 383, 1, 6, 687671) That simple bit of service is its own reward.
('65', 383, 1, 7, 687717) Thanks or any outward expression is a poor substitute.
('65', 383, 1, 8, 687772) Mira is working well and so is her ward.
('65', 383, 1, 9, 687813) Well, the preliminary acknowledgement from Delhi has come.
('65', 383, 2, 10, 687872) If there is any development I shall use the cable.
('65', 383, 2, 11, 687923) About the J[oint] Gommittee’s report, you must have seen my opinion.

('65', 384, 8, 16, 689677) My opinion on the White Paper is well known and I have seen nothing to change it.

('65', 384, 11, 20, 689845) The All India Village Industries Association takes a long time to be born.
('65', 384, 11, 21, 689920) All the consolation I can give the public is that all the available time at the disposal of J. C. Kumarappa and myself is being devoted to the task.
('65', 384, 11, 22, 690069) Three questions confront us: location of the Central Office, composition of the Central Board and agencies.
('65', 384, 12, 23, 690177) 1 The Joint Parliamentary Committee Report was released to the Press on November 22, 1934.
('65', 385, 0, 1, 690268) 386 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 385, 1, 2, 690310) Though all these questions worry us, that of the composition of the Board causes the greatest trouble.
('65', 385, 1, 3, 690413) The task is tremendous.
('65', 385, 1, 4, 690437) The goal is great.
('65', 385, 1, 5, 690456) Rejuvenation of villages in the face of the current fashion of highly developed mechanization and centralization is no easy job.
('65', 385, 1, 6, 690585) We have, therefore, come to the conclusion that the Board must be composed of only a few earnest persons who have a living faith in the programme of the Association, who have an aptitude for the task and who will give the Board much, if not the whole, of their time.
('65', 385, 1, 7, 690852) We are trying to find persons, irrespective of parties, who will shoulder the burden.
('65', 385, 1, 8, 690938) So far as branches are concerned, we have tentatively come to the conclusion that the districts should be the units directly responsible for the Central Board.
('65', 385, 1, 9, 691098) Since the British official districts are not all equal in area or population, we will not hesitate to subdivide them where necessary.
('65', 385, 1, 10, 691232) The predominant consideration will be decentralization and creation of a living touch with the villagers.
('65', 385, 1, 11, 691338) There will be direct connection with the States wherever they will permit it.
('65', 385, 1, 12, 691416) We want to serve all the villages of geographical India.
('65', 385, 1, 13, 691473) There is difficulty, too, regarding choice of the Central office.
('65', 385, 1, 14, 691539) We would gladly establish it in a village, if that is possible.
('65', 385, 1, 15, 691603) But our choice is limited by two considerations.
('65', 385, 1, 16, 691652) We do not want to invest the meagre funds, that have been promised or have already come, in land and brick and mortar.
('65', 385, 1, 17, 691771) We have, therefore; to confine our selection to such places where we can get the required accommodation for the asking.
('65', 385, 1, 18, 691891) The second limitation is that the Central office should be near the main line of the railways and should be easily accessible from all the parts of India.
('65', 385, 1, 19, 692046) But let me not anticipate events.
('65', 385, 1, 20, 692080) I have shared enough with the public to enable those who will to guide us with advice.
('65', 385, 1, 21, 692167) We invite the prayers of all who are in sympathy with our difficult mission.

('65', 385, 4, 24, 692298) Sitarama Sastry of Vinaya Ashram, Repalle, Guntur District, Andhradesha, in offering the services unreservedly of the whole of his Ashram to the All India Village Industries Association, says:
('65', 385, 5, 25, 692491) The following items of work suggest themselves to me and I commend them to you.
('65', 385, 5, 26, 692571) (I) Shoe making, (2) hand ginning of seed cotton, (3)
('65', 386, 0, 1, 692625) VOL. 65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 387
('65', 386, 1, 2, 692676) preparation of jaggery from the juice of palmyra tree, (4) improved pottery, (5) hand made paper, (6) stone dressing, (7) hand made groundnut kernels, (8) extracting oil and other products from the outer rinds of oranges, (9).
('65', 386, 1, 3, 692903) preservation of palmyra fruits.
('65', 386, 1, 4, 692935) The second item will also help in the khadi industry; the third will help in the solution of the drink problem.
('65', 386, 1, 5, 693047) Palmyras are grown in large numbers in this district, and the ripe fruit of these trees has been analysed and found to contain valuable elements of food.
('65', 386, 1, 6, 693201) oranges are also grown on a large scale in this district and are cheap.
('65', 386, 1, 7, 693273) The outer rind is thrown away as useless,.
('65', 386, 1, 8, 693316) but it is really useful from the commercial point of view.
('65', 386, 1, 9, 693375) It contains an inflammable oil and is also sold in the market as orange peel.
('65', 386, 1, 10, 693453) Kondaveedu is a village in this district which has long been famous for hand paper.
('65', 386, 1, 11, 693537) The District Congress Committee tried to revive this industry in 1921 , but the attempt was given up, owing to the indifference of the workmen.
('65', 386, 1, 12, 693681) A special stone is available in Palnad which is locally dressed and is used for paper weights, for flooring and walls and table slabs.
('65', 386, 1, 13, 693816) It is ordinarily called Palnad marble.
('65', 386, 1, 14, 693855) Hand made groundnut kernels are sold in the South and are cheaper than machine made kernels.
('65', 386, 1, 15, 693948) Groundnut crop is raised in several parts of the district.
('65', 386, 1, 16, 694007) Mr. T. Ramaswamy Gupta of Bezwada, a vakil who gave up his profession for spiritual sadhana, is responsible for improved pottery, and the earthenware prepared under his directions are far superior to the articles made by the country potter!
('65', 386, 1, 17, 694248) This is not the only or the first offer.
('65', 386, 1, 18, 694289) It is a matter of great joy to me that many such offers have been received from almost all the parts of India.
('65', 386, 1, 19, 694400) This happens to be the latest and contains the information which other workers would value.
('65', 386, 1, 20, 694492) I would recommend all the workers who are offering services to commence work without waiting for directions.
('65', 386, 1, 21, 694601) The idea behind the village industries scheme is that we should look to the villages for the supply of our daily needs and that, when we find that some needs are not so supplied, we should see whether with a little trouble and organization they cannot be profitably supplied by the villagers.
('65', 386, 1, 22, 694894) In estimating the profit, we should think of the villager, not of ourselves.
('65', 386, 1, 23, 694971) It may be that in the initial stages, we might have to pay a little more than the ordinary price and get an inferior article in the bargain.
('65', 386, 1, 24, 695112) Things will improve, if we will interest ourselves in the supplier of our needs and insist on his doing better and take the trouble of helping to do better.

('65', 387, 3, 5, 695431) I see that we hold perhaps diametrically opposite views.
('65', 387, 3, 6, 695488) My conviction based upon extensive experience of village life is that in India at any rate for generations to come, we shall not be able to make much use of mechanical power for salving the problem of ever growing poverty of the masses.
('65', 387, 3, 7, 695725) We are too many and we have so many idle hours at our disposal that it would be suicidal to make use of mechanical power and allow human power to run to waste.
('65', 387, 3, 8, 695885) The question of leisure after toil comes into being when people learn the art of making effective use of their waste hours.
('65', 387, 3, 9, 696009) Such being my view the extract that you have sent me from Stalin has no appeal for me at all.
('65', 387, 3, 10, 696103) The more expressive extract from Lenin makes matters worse for me.
('65', 387, 3, 11, 696170) It is like much cry and little wool.
('65', 387, 3, 12, 696207) I could be no party to engaging the villagers in producing army machinery and army stores.
('65', 387, 3, 13, 696298) If India has no desire to take part in the gory exploitation of unmechanized regions of the earth, she has no need to fear aggression from foreign countries.
('65', 387, 3, 14, 696456) My dream may remain wholly unrealized and India may become a willing or unwilling partner in the sin of exploitation.
('65', 387, 3, 15, 696574) Nevertheless I would use the whole of the power that God may vouchsafe to me in stemming the onrush of the violent current.
('65', 387, 3, 16, 696698) I should take delight in perishing in the attempt.
('65', 387, 3, 17, 696749) In spite of the strength of my conviction, I entertain great regard for your fine abilities and love of the country, and that shall be unabated whether I have the good fortune to secure your co operation or face your honest opposition.
('65', 387, 4, 18, 696985) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI SIR M. VISVESVARAYYA, K. C. I. E.

('65', 388, 1, 2, 697284) 475. LETTER TO AMRIT KAUR
('65', 388, 2, 3, 697310) November 23, 1934
('65', 388, 3, 4, 697328) DEAR SISTER, I have your letter.
('65', 388, 3, 5, 697361) I have gone through your draft proposal for the training of social service workers.
('65', 388, 3, 6, 697445) I am inclined to think that the District Boards cannot open the centres you contemplate without the permission of the Government.
('65', 388, 3, 7, 697575) But that is a legal point on which I cannot write with any confidence.
('65', 388, 3, 8, 697646) I have, however, a deeper objection to your scheme.
('65', 388, 3, 9, 697698) District Boards as they are constituted in India have no interest in things of permanent value such as you have proposed.
('65', 388, 3, 10, 697820) Their very constitution perhaps disables them for taking such interest.
('65', 388, 3, 11, 697892) What you contemplate is pioneer work.
('65', 388, 3, 12, 697930) It is essentially meant for reformers.
('65', 388, 3, 13, 697969) Therefore it has got to be taken up by private agencies, and when they make of such training centres a success?
('65', 388, 3, 14, 698081) the thing becomes easy for District Boards and the like to take up.
('65', 388, 3, 15, 698149) If I have understood your object correctly, you want to rejuvenate the villages.
('65', 388, 3, 16, 698230) The trend is in the opposite direction.
('65', 388, 3, 17, 698270) Hence neither District Boards nor the Government as such will handle the thing in the manner you and I would have them do.
('65', 388, 3, 18, 698393) I wish we could meet early.
('65', 388, 4, 19, 698421) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI

('65', 388, 8, 24, 698565) MY DEAR MASEKAR,
('65', 388, 9, 25, 698582) I thank you for your letter.
('65', 388, 9, 26, 698611) The Village Industries Association will not be concerned exclusively with the industries of the depressed classes, but will be concerned with the industries of the villages as a whole.
('65', 388, 9, 27, 698796) Naturally [the] depressed classes will figure prominently in its scheme; but that will figure among the villagers who have been exploited by the city people.
('65', 388, 9, 28, 698954) The scheme is still in process of formation.
('65', 388, 9, 29, 698999) If you have any advice to give, I shall appreciate it.
('65', 388, 9, 30, 699054) No one will be involved in or committed to any political movement.
('65', 388, 9, 31, 699121) People belonging to different political schools will be welcome as helpers or

('65', 389, 1, 3, 699473) I hope that this answers your questions fully.

('65', 389, 6, 10, 699738) DEAR DURGABAI, I see I have put my feet into it.
('65', 389, 6, 11, 699787) I should have written to you directly.
('65', 389, 6, 12, 699826) Then there would have been no misunderstanding.
('65', 389, 6, 13, 699874) But as I knew that you enjoyed intimate relatiions with Jamnalalji and as I was overwhelmed, as I am still, with work, I felt that I was safe in asking Radhakisan to write to you, not at all officially but as a fellow worker in the cause.
('65', 389, 6, 14, 700113) But you ave my unreserved apology for unconsciously departing form the proper procedure.
('65', 389, 6, 15, 700202) My approach to uyou is one more illustration of short ut being the longest in the end.
('65', 389, 6, 16, 700289) You will now please excuse me.
('65', 389, 6, 17, 700320) I understand you explanation and I am happly to be able to inform you that the young man who was reported to have lost his one full year after all did not do so.
('65', 389, 6, 18, 700482) Fortunately, at the same time that I asked Radhakisan to write you I sent an inquiry to the Secretary of the local Sangh of Vile Parle.
('65', 389, 6, 19, 700618) He saw the young man and satisfied himself that by a stroke of good fortune, what might have been a loss of one year was averted.
('65', 389, 6, 20, 700748) All is well that ends well.
('65', 389, 6, 21, 700776) Therefore I would like you to dismiss from your mind my seeming impertinence.
('65', 389, 7, 22, 700854) Yours sincerely SMT.

('65', 390, 3, 6, 701198) When you administer eggs, what is the mode?
('65', 390, 3, 7, 701242) If I remember right, in the case of Manu you used to dilute the contents of raw eggs with water.
('65', 390, 3, 8, 701339) What is the effect of eggs on the system?
('65', 390, 3, 9, 701381) Are they too heating, and what is the quantity?
('65', 390, 3, 10, 701429) I am afraid the Harijan Sevak Sangh would not donate Rs. 500 to you.
('65', 390, 3, 11, 701498) The paragraph about Satavlekar does not carry weight.

('65', 390, 7, 19, 701811) I shall gladly receive fruit from his garden whenever he feels inclined to send it.: As you know, we are here a big family and we can do justice to fruit whenever it comes our way.
('65', 390, 7, 20, 701992) Yes, the Assembly elections have been a perfect revelation.
('65', 390, 7, 21, 702052) The South has easily topped the list with its 100 per cent victories and overwhelming majorities.
('65', 390, 7, 22, 702150) It is a further demonstration of the unfailing victory of Truth and sacrifice.
('65', 390, 7, 23, 702229) I hope you and yours are keeping well.

('65', 391, 4, 6, 702644) It seems to me to be self contradictory.
('65', 391, 4, 7, 702685) You first of all want me to push further my programme of self control and you want me at the same time to be committed to self indulgence.
('65', 391, 4, 8, 702824) Nothing that I have as yet seen has moved me from the view that birth control methods as at present adopted must ultimately lead to degeneration and inertia.

('65', 395, 4, 6, 706655) When it just seemed possible, against all hope, that Harilal had turned over a new leaf, I didn’t think it wise to write to you.
('65', 395, 4, 7, 706784) I thought that on no account should there be unpleasantness.
('65', 395, 4, 8, 706845) Why did you take that to mean that you were not a daughter to me?
('65', 395, 4, 9, 706911) Did you forget that, though Harilal was my son, I did not yield to him for years?
('65', 395, 4, 10, 706993) But since you have been embittered in many ways, I can understand your feeling hurt by any small thing that somebody may do.
('65', 395, 4, 11, 707118) Let Harilal live alone and learn from experience.
('65', 395, 4, 12, 707168) What shall I say about Kamu 2?
('65', 395, 4, 13, 707199) She has suffered much.
('65', 395, 4, 14, 707222) Fate has not been kind to either of you.
('65', 395, 4, 15, 707263) You should, therefore, learn the art of finding happiness in suffering.
('65', 395, 4, 16, 707335) That can be done only by constant repetition of the Lord’s name.
('65', 395, 4, 17, 707400) Do you have any proposal in view for Manu 3?
('65', 395, 4, 18, 707445) I myself am in no hurry of course.

('65', 396, 9, 19, 708788) She seems to be deeply interested in it.
('65', 396, 9, 20, 708829) She left on my mind the impression that she would like to work with you and other sisters.
('65', 396, 9, 21, 708920) Most probably she would talk to you and try to gather together all those who might be interested in the village work.
('65', 396, 9, 22, 709038) I would like you all sisters to try to produce a harmonious blending if it is at all possible.
('65', 396, 9, 23, 709133) You know best what to do and how to do it.
('65', 396, 9, 24, 709176) Jamnalalji was telling me that Perin 4 was suffering from cold and cough.
('65', 396, 9, 25, 709250) She ought to give herself rest and get rid of the cough and cold.

('65', 397, 4, 5, 709741) You offered to send your machine with Sjt.

('65', 397, 4, 7, 709845) But I have been pressed by friends to test the machine myself and under Kale’s observation.
('65', 397, 4, 8, 709937) If, therefore, your offer abides, I would like you to send one machine for me to test.
('65', 397, 4, 9, 710024) I would also like someone who is an expert in village tools to accompany Sjt.
('65', 397, 4, 10, 710102) Kale unless the latter is able to attend to such tools himself.
('65', 397, 4, 11, 710166) I would like to suggest some improvements.
('65', 397, 4, 12, 710209) If you send the machine and mechanic both should be here as early as possible after the 1st December.

('65', 398, 8, 28, 712222) 495. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS 2
('65', 398, 9, 29, 712252) November 26, 1934 During the Harijan tour I discovered that the salt concession, which was part of the Irwin Gandhi Pact, was not being availed of by the: people.
('65', 398, 9, 30, 712415) I observed also how much poor people suffered because of want of salt, although it was lying in front of them in areas adjoining the sea.
('65', 398, 9, 31, 712553) In Mangalore, the fishermen brought the thing prominently to my notice.
('65', 398, 9, 32, 712625) I thereupon entered into correspondence with Government as early as last March.
('65', 398, 9, 33, 712705) The then Finance Member, Sir George Schuster, promptly replied to my query, and I discovered
('65', 398, 10, 34, 712798) 1 The letter is incomplete.
('65', 398, 10, 35, 712826) 2 This appeared under the title “Free Salt for the Salt of the Earth”.
('65', 399, 0, 1, 712897) 400 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 399, 1, 2, 712939) to my joy that the clause had not suffered wreck.
('65', 399, 1, 3, 712989) I ought to have published the correspondence between Sir George Schuster and myself much earlier than I am now doing.
('65', 399, 1, 4, 713107) I need not go into the causes for this delay.
('65', 399, 1, 5, 713153) I now publish the correspondence, together with the clause and the communique 1 based upon it and setting forth the conditions of operating the clause.
('65', 399, 1, 6, 713305) When the Pact was published, in commenting upon it, I had described this as the humanitarian part of the document.
('65', 399, 1, 7, 713420) It was the humanitarian appeal that had found ready response from Lord Irwin.
('65', 399, 1, 8, 713498) Those who now avail themselves of the concession will bear this fact in mind and will, therefore, refrain from making any commercial use of the concession, either directly or indirectly, and work it strictly within the four corners of the communique.
('65', 399, 1, 9, 713749) All those Congressmen and others who are interested in villagers concerned making full use of the concession will bear in mind the list of areas from which concession for free manufacture and collection of salt has been withdrawn.
('65', 399, 1, 10, 713980) The workers will also bear in mind that it is open to all concerned to make application to the local officers for the restoration of the concession.
('65', 399, 1, 11, 714129) In no case should the concession be worked without sanction being previously obtained.

('65', 400, 3, 4, 714886) NARANDAS, I got your letter.
('65', 400, 3, 5, 714915) The money belonging to the Cow protection Society which has been spent may be taken as lost.
('65', 400, 3, 6, 715008) It will not be proper now to ask for it.
('65', 400, 3, 7, 715049) Ambalalbhai’s attitude has changed.
('65', 400, 3, 8, 715085) If we can[not] get that amount from any source, I suppose the loss will have to be made good from the funds of the Cow protection Society.
('65', 400, 3, 9, 715224) Let us see now what Mavalankar and Ranchhodbhai can do.
('65', 400, 3, 10, 715280) If they can collect some amount, we shall not have to pay much from the Society’s funds.
('65', 400, 3, 11, 715369) Aren’t the Bal Mandir and Kumar Mandir parts of the school?
('65', 400, 3, 12, 715429) Don’t they meet a need ?
('65', 400, 3, 13, 715454) I understand what.
('65', 400, 3, 14, 715473) you say about Harilal.
('65', 400, 3, 15, 715496) I don’t have independent accommodation for myself here.
('65', 400, 3, 16, 715552) Nor can we keep him in Jamnalalji’s house.
('65', 400, 3, 17, 715595) It seems proper, therefore, that till he gets properly trained and learns to observe the rules he should continue to stay there.
('65', 400, 3, 18, 715724) I am afraid we cannot have a joint office for the Spinners, Association and Village Industries Association.
('65', 400, 3, 19, 715832) The latter will include a great many small activities, and so it seems to me desirable that the two offices should be separate for the time being.
('65', 400, 3, 20, 715979) The fields of work of the two bodies will of course be complementary to each other.
('65', 400, 3, 21, 716063) It seems that the headquarters of the Village Industries Association will be fixed at Wardha.
('65', 400, 3, 22, 716157) Probably when you wrote your reply you had not received my letter, in which I had asked you whether you can be free from there.
('65', 400, 3, 23, 716285) My respectful greetings to Father and Mother.

('65', 401, 4, 5, 716630) You have sent a 20 page preface for your ten points; what violence is this!
('65', 401, 4, 6, 716706) Moreover you have praised Mirabehn; is it for lending respectability to your censure of her?
('65', 401, 4, 7, 716799) What violence is this too!
('65', 401, 4, 8, 716826) And you crown both with your violent pride.
('65', 401, 4, 9, 716870) You have refuted what you imagine to be my views with the help of your points.
('65', 401, 4, 10, 716949) But I think between my views.
('65', 401, 4, 11, 716979) and what you consider to be my views there is as much difference as between a horse and a donkey.
('65', 401, 4, 12, 717077) How then can I satisfy you?
('65', 401, 4, 13, 717105) Save me from my friends, followers and flatterers.
('65', 401, 4, 14, 717156) Your 26 page letter has made me utter this prayer.

('65', 402, 4, 5, 718057) You have outdone everybody in the race for votes.
('65', 402, 4, 6, 718107) But even you had to spend money?
('65', 402, 4, 7, 718140) What a tragedy!
('65', 402, 4, 8, 718156) How much were you out of pocket?
('65', 402, 4, 9, 718189) Without his opposition the Congress could not have shown its hold over the people.

('65', 402, 11, 16, 718437) Singer machine does not replace the needle woman, it gives her a better needle.
('65', 402, 11, 17, 718517) We have village rice pounding and flourgrinding machines.
('65', 402, 11, 18, 718575) If someone were to give me an effective substitute, I will take it today.
('65', 402, 11, 19, 718649) What I resist is flour and rice mills which put thousands of women out of work and rob them of health.
('65', 402, 11, 20, 718752) My regards to your sister in Delhi.

('65', 403, 3, 4, 718984) SHARMA,
('65', 403, 4, 5, 718992) Your letter.
('65', 403, 4, 6, 719005) You have again been hasty.
('65', 403, 4, 7, 719032) How did you conclude that Mogheji wanted you to go away for good or that he was happy at your leaving thus.
('65', 403, 4, 8, 719140) This too is mere suspicion.
('65', 403, 4, 9, 719168) If people are afraid of you it is because you lose no time in making allegations and entertaining all sorts of fanciful ideas.
('65', 403, 4, 10, 719295) It I were to ask Kamalnayan, he will, I am sure; have a different story to tell.
('65', 403, 4, 11, 719376) To the best of my knowledge no one doubts your honest desire to serve.
('65', 403, 4, 12, 719447) But I am myself observing that you are misunderstood.
('65', 403, 4, 13, 719501) You should stick to your resolution.
('65', 403, 4, 14, 719538) You belong to the Ashram, you have to return to it and must prepare yourself to do so.
('65', 403, 4, 15, 719625) Forget about the incident at the station 1 and all that you have written to me.
('65', 403, 4, 16, 719705) Dr. Shirlekar has sent nothing.
('65', 403, 4, 17, 719737) I shall send for [your books].

('65', 403, 4, 20, 719866) The account of Krishna’s health pains me.
('65', 403, 4, 21, 719908) Now you have to concentrate on her recovery.
('65', 403, 4, 22, 719953) By all means take a separate house.
('65', 403, 4, 23, 719989) Do write to me if your brothers are in any way incon venienced in meeting your expenses.
('65', 403, 4, 24, 720078) It cannot be said that Ramdas is all right but he has progressed to the point of taking three eggs.

('65', 403, 4, 27, 720248) which is good but it may not go up further.
('65', 403, 4, 28, 720292) I feel I have gained some strength as a result of fresh milk and raw vegetables.
('65', 403, 4, 29, 720373) A reduced diet [uncooked food] is giving me as much strength as I derived from a larger quantity of milk and vegetables.
('65', 403, 4, 30, 720494) obviously, the expenditure has considerably gone down and time is saved.
('65', 403, 4, 31, 720567) I must have more experience to say anything further.

('65', 404, 7, 19, 721728) DEAR MR. MIEVILLE,
('65', 404, 8, 20, 721747) I must thank you for your prompt reply to my letter of the 15th instant.
('65', 404, 8, 21, 721820) But I cannot help saying that the decision come to in regard to my contemplated visit to the Frontier Province is painful and places me in a very awkward position.
('65', 404, 8, 22, 721984) In that sense perhaps the decision may be regarded as unfortunate.
('65', 404, 8, 23, 722051) The only ray of hope I see in your letter is that the undesirability of my visit refers to “the present time”.
('65', 404, 8, 24, 722162) 2 Could you please give me a definition of the expression?
('65', 404, 8, 25, 722221) Could you please also tell me, if my enquiry is not inappropriate, why it is considered undesirable for me to visit the.

('65', 405, 6, 10, 722920) MY DEAR GANESAN,
('65', 405, 7, 11, 722937) Before I got your note through H. Sharma, I had intended to tell you on reading your “Congressman’, that it was a waste of effort.
('65', 405, 7, 12, 723068) Your writing was unbalanced and betrayed ignorance and bias.
('65', 405, 7, 13, 723129) Your attack on Rajaji was ungracious.
('65', 405, 7, 14, 723167) You will be surprised to know that he had no hand in the drafting of the resolutions.
('65', 405, 7, 15, 723253) They were my drafts and he had no suggestions on the resolution to which you have so ignorantly referred.
('65', 405, 7, 16, 723359) You simply judge him from your own unhappy experiences.
('65', 405, 7, 17, 723415) But otherwise, too, your criticism of men and measures is not of the right type.
('65', 405, 7, 18, 723496) The majority of journalists spoil things by judging things.
('65', 405, 7, 19, 723556) They will discharge their function well, if they will give unvarnished versions of events.
('65', 405, 7, 20, 723647) When they criticize they must base their judgment on facts strictly within their knowledge.
('65', 405, 7, 21, 723739) If you are going to become a good constructive worker, you must not waste your time after conducting newspapers.
('65', 405, 7, 22, 723852) Choose one vocation or another.
('65', 405, 7, 23, 723884) Harihar Sharma will tell you more about my suggestions and so will Kakasaheb who is probably coming there.

('65', 406, 3, 6, 724522) ANSARI,
('65', 406, 4, 7, 724530) This is about a naturopath named Sharma.
('65', 406, 4, 8, 724571) He belongs to Khurja.
('65', 406, 4, 9, 724593) He owned and conducted a sun treatment hospital in Delhi.
('65', 406, 4, 10, 724651) Through Amtussalaam whom you met here, I came to know him now three years ago.
('65', 406, 4, 11, 724730) There was much show about his hospital and more about the books he wrote.
('65', 406, 4, 12, 724804) Now he has humbled himself.
('65', 406, 4, 13, 724832) He has given up the hospital and burned his books.
('65', 406, 4, 14, 724883) He wants at my instance to put his knowledge on a more solid foundation and therefore wants to know things about the [human] body which should be common to all whether they are allopaths or naturopaths or any other.
('65', 406, 4, 15, 725099) But he cannot afford to go to a medical college and begin studies there.
('65', 406, 4, 16, 725172) He has sufficient knowledge to be able to pursue private studies, if.
('65', 406, 4, 17, 725242) he had some guidance.
('65', 406, 4, 18, 725264) What I would like you to do is to tell me what he should read and what accessories he.
('65', 406, 4, 19, 725351) should require.
('65', 406, 4, 20, 725367) And could you lend him one after another the books he should read?
('65', 406, 4, 21, 725434) If you are sufficiently interested in him he will call on you.
('65', 406, 4, 22, 725497) I do not want or expect you to give much of your time to this work.
('65', 406, 4, 23, 725565) If you can easily jot down the books he should read in their order, I should be thankful.
('65', 406, 4, 24, 725655) I shall procure or buy the books, if you have none to lend.
('65', 406, 4, 25, 725715) I do want to help Shri Sharma as I believe him to be [an] earnest seeker who wants to dedicate his knowledge and all for the alleviation of human suffering.

('65', 407, 1, 2, 725993) 506. SPEECH AT GANDHI SEVA SANGH 1
('65', 407, 2, 3, 726028) [On or before November 30, 1934] 2
('65', 407, 3, 4, 726063) Some of you here perhaps know how the Village Industries Association came into being.
('65', 407, 3, 5, 726149) During my extensive Harijan tour last year it was clearly borne in upon me that the way in which we were carrying on our khadi work was hardly enough either to universalize khadi or to rejuvenate the villages.
('65', 407, 3, 6, 726359) I saw that it was confined to a very few and that even those who used khadi exclusively were under the impression that they need do nothing else and that they might use other things irrespective of how and where they were made.
('65', 407, 3, 7, 726587) Khadi was thus becoming a lifeless symbol, and I saw that, if the state of things was allowed to go on, khadi might even die of sheer inanition.
('65', 407, 3, 8, 726732) It is not that a concentrated, intensive effort devoted exclusively to khadi would not be conducive to success, but there was neither that concentration nor intensity.
('65', 407, 3, 9, 726900) All did not give all their spare time to the charkha or the takli, and all had not taken to the exclusive use of khadi—though their number was larger than that of the spinners.
('65', 407, 3, 10, 727077) But the rest were all idle.
('65', 407, 3, 11, 727105) There were multitudes of men with quantities of enforced leisure on their hands.
('65', 407, 3, 12, 727186) That I saw was a state which could lead only to our undoing.
('65', 407, 3, 13, 727247) ‘These people” I said to myself, ‘could never win swaraj.
('65', 407, 3, 14, 727305) For, their involuntary and voluntary idleness made them a perpetual prey of exploiters, foreign and indigenous.
('65', 407, 3, 15, 727417) Whether the exploiter was from outside or from the Indian cities, their state would be the same, they would have no swaraj., So I said to myself, ‘Let these people be asked to do something else; if they will not interest themselves in khadi, let them take up some work which used to be done by their ancestors but which has of late died out.
('65', 407, 3, 16, 727759) There were numerous things of daily use which they used to produce themselves not many years ago, but for which they now depend on the outer world.
('65', 407, 3, 17, 727907) There were numerous things of daily use to the town dweller for which he depended on the villagers but which he now imports from cities.
('65', 407, 3, 18, 728044) The moment the villagers decided to devote all their spare
('65', 407, 4, 19, 728103) 1 Published in Harijan under the title “A. I. V. I. A. —Its Meaning and Scope”.
('65', 407, 4, 20, 728183) This is a “brief resume” of Gandhiji’s “third talk”.
('65', 407, 4, 21, 728236) Reports of the first two speeches are not available.
('65', 407, 4, 22, 728289) 2 According to a report in The Bombay Chronicle 6 12 1934, the annual session of Gandhi Seva Sangh was held in the last week of November 1934.

('65', 408, 1, 2, 728483) time to doing something useful and the town dwellers to use those village products, the snapped link between the villagers and the towndwellers would be restored.
('65', 408, 1, 3, 728646) As to which of the extinct or moribund village industries and crafts could be revived, we could not be sure until we sat down in the midst of the villages to investigate, to tabulate and classify.
('65', 408, 1, 4, 728843) But I picked up two things of the most vital importance: articles of diet and articles of dress.
('65', 408, 1, 5, 728940) Khadi was there.
('65', 408, 1, 6, 728957) In the matter of articles of diet, we were fast losing our self sufficiency.
('65', 408, 1, 7, 729034) only a few years ago, we pounded our own paddy and ground our own flour.
('65', 408, 1, 8, 729107) Put aside for the time being the question of health.
('65', 408, 1, 9, 729160) It is an indisputable fact that the flour mill and the rice mill have driven millions of women out of employment and deprived them of the means of eking out their income.
('65', 408, 1, 10, 729331) Sugar is fast taking the place of jaggery, and ready made articles of diet like biscuits and sweetmeats are freely being imported into our villages.
('65', 408, 1, 11, 729480) This means that all the village industries are gradually slipping out of the hands of the villager, who has become producer of raw materials for the exploiter.
('65', 408, 1, 12, 729640) He continually gives, and gets little in return.
('65', 408, 1, 13, 729689) Even the little he gets for the raw material he produces he gives back to the sugar merchant and the cloth merchant.
('65', 408, 1, 14, 729806) His mind and body have become very much like those of the animals, his constant companions.
('65', 408, 1, 15, 729898) When we come to think of it, we find that the villager of today is not even half so intelligent or resourceful as the villager of fifty years ago.
('65', 408, 1, 16, 730045) For, whereas the former is reduced to a state of miserable dependence and idleness, the latter used his mind and body for all he needed and produced them at home.
('65', 408, 1, 17, 730208) Even the village artisan today partakes of the resourcelessness that has overtaken the rest of the village.
('65', 408, 1, 18, 730316) Go to the village carpenter and ask him to make a spinning wheel for you go to the village smith and ask him to make a spindle for you, you will be disappointed.
('65', 408, 1, 19, 730478) This is a deplorable state of things.
('65', 408, 1, 20, 730516) It is as a remedy for it that the Village Industries Association has been conceived.
('65', 408, 1, 21, 730601) This cry of ‘back to the village” some critics say, is putting back the hands of the clock of progress.
('65', 408, 1, 22, 730705) But is it really so?
('65', 408, 1, 23, 730726) Is it going back to the village, or rendering back to it what belongs to it?
('65', 408, 1, 24, 730803) I am not asking the city dwellers to go to and live in the villages.
('65', 408, 1, 25, 730872) But I am asking them to render unto the villagers what is due to them.
('65', 408, 1, 26, 730943) Is there any single raw material that the city dwellers can obtain except from the villager?
('65', 408, 1, 27, 731036) If they cannot, why not teach him to work on it himself, as he used to before and as he would do now but for our exploiting inroads?
('65', 409, 0, 1, 731169) 410 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 409, 1, 2, 731211) But this reinstating the villager in what was once his natural position is no easy task.
('65', 409, 1, 3, 731300) I had thought that I should be able to frame a constitution and set the Association going with the help of Sjt.
('65', 409, 1, 4, 731412) Kumarappa within a short time.
('65', 409, 1, 5, 731443) But the more I dive into it, the more I find myself out of my depth.
('65', 409, 1, 6, 731512) In a sense, the work is much more difficult than khadi, which does not in any way offer a complicated problem.
('65', 409, 1, 7, 731623) You have simply to exclude all foreign and machine made cloth, and you have established khadi on a secure foundation.
('65', 409, 1, 8, 731741) But here the field is so vast, there is such an infinite variety of industries to handle and organize, that it will tax all our business talent, expert knowledge and scientific training.
('65', 409, 1, 9, 731928) It cannot be achieved without hard toil, incessant endeavour and application of all our business and scientific abilities to this supreme purpose.
('65', 409, 1, 10, 732075) Thus, I sent a questionnaire 1 to several of our well known doctors and chemists, asking them to enlighten me on the chemical analysis and different food values of polished and unpolished rice, jaggery and sugar, and so on.
('65', 409, 1, 11, 732299) Many friends, I am thankful to say, have immediately responded, but only to confess that there has been no research in some of the directions I had inquired about.
('65', 409, 1, 12, 732463) Is it not a tragedy that no scientist should be able to give me the chemical analysis of such a simple article as gur?
('65', 409, 1, 13, 732582) The reason is that we have not thought of the villager.
('65', 409, 1, 14, 732638) Take the case of honey.
('65', 409, 1, 15, 732662) I am told that in foreign countries such a careful analysis of honey is made that no sample which fails to satisfy a particular test is bottled for the market.
('65', 409, 1, 16, 732822) In India we have got vast resources for the production of the finest honey, but we have not much expert knowledge in the matter.
('65', 409, 1, 17, 732951) An esteemed doctor friend writes to say that in his hospital, at any rate, polished rice is taboo and that it has been proved after experiments on rats and other animals that polished rice is harmful.
('65', 409, 1, 18, 733152) But why have not all the medical men published the results of their investigation and experiment and joined in declaring the use of such rice as positively harmful?
('65', 409, 1, 19, 733317) I have just by one or two instances indicated my difficulty.
('65', 409, 1, 20, 733378) What sort of an organization should I have?
('65', 409, 1, 21, 733422) What kinds of laboratory research shall we have to go in for?
('65', 409, 1, 22, 733484) We shall need a number of scientists and chemists prepared to lay not only their expert knowledge at our disposal, but to sit down in our laboratories and to devote hours of time, free of charge, to experiments in the direction I have indicated.
('65', 409, 1, 23, 733730) We shall have not only to publish the results from time

('65', 410, 1, 2, 733882) to time, but we shall have to inspect and certify various products.
('65', 410, 1, 3, 733950) Also we shall have to find out whether the villager who produces an article or foodstuff rests content with exporting it and with using a cheap substitute imported from outside.
('65', 410, 1, 4, 734128) We shall have to see that the villagers become first of all self contained and then cater for the needs of the city dwellers.
('65', 410, 1, 5, 734254) For this purpose we shall have to form district organizations, and, where districts are too big to handle, we may have to divide the districts into sub districts.
('65', 410, 1, 6, 734417) Each of these—some 250—should have an agent who will carry out a survey and submit a report in the terms of the instructions issued to him from the head office.
('65', 410, 1, 7, 734578) These agents shall have to be full timers and whole hoggers, with a live faith in the programme and prepared immediately to make the necessary adjustment in their daily life.
('65', 410, 1, 8, 734753) This work will certainly need money, but, more than money, it will need men of strong faith and willing hands.
('65', 410, 2, 9, 734864) Q. Will not this programme swamp the khadi programme which has yet to be fulfilled?
('65', 410, 3, 10, 734948) Khadi cannot be moved from its central place.
('65', 410, 3, 11, 734994) Khadi will be the sun of the whole industrial solar system.
('65', 410, 3, 12, 735054) All the other industries will receive warmth and sustenance from the khadi industry.
('65', 410, 4, 13, 735139) Q. What exactly are the industries we must revive or promote?
('65', 410, 5, 14, 735201) A. I have indicated the lines.
('65', 410, 5, 15, 735232) We must promote every useful industry that was existent a short while ago and the extinction of which has now resulted in unemployment.
('65', 410, 6, 16, 735368) Q. Have we to declare a boycott of the rice and the flour mills?
('65', 410, 7, 17, 735433) A. We have to declare no boycott, but we shall ask the people to husk their own rice and to grind their own flour, and we shall carry on persistent propaganda in favour of hand pounded rice and hand ground flour as better articles of diet from the point of view of health.
('65', 410, 7, 18, 735706) Let us declare a boycott of idleness.
('65', 410, 8, 19, 735744) Q. Shall we use the Congress Committees for this purpose?
('65', 410, 9, 20, 735802) A. of course.
('65', 410, 9, 21, 735816) We shall use and take help from any source.
('65', 410, 9, 22, 735860) We have no politics as such and no party.
('65', 410, 10, 23, 735902) Q. The formation of the Central Board means centralization?
('65', 410, 11, 24, 735962) A. Not quite.
('65', 410, 11, 25, 735976) The districts will be the working centres.
('65', 410, 11, 26, 736019) The Central office will be only a watch tower for the whole of India issuing

('65', 411, 1, 2, 736138) instructions, but not a board of administration.
('65', 411, 1, 3, 736187) It will be a sort of correspondence school through which the various agents will carry on mutual exchange of thought and compare notes.
('65', 411, 1, 4, 736323) We want to avoid centralization of administration, we want centralization of thought, ideas and scientific knowledge.

('65', 411, 3, 6, 736460) 507. ‘WHY NOT LABOUR SAVING DEVICES’
('65', 411, 4, 7, 736497) A fair friend who was enthused over the contemplated formation of the All India Village Industries Association, on reading my Press message 1 on the preliminary programme, writes: The very idea of the revival or encouragement of the hand husking of rice and chakki grinding even for villages has scared me from, and abated my enthusiasm for village work.
('65', 411, 4, 8, 736852) It seems lo me an enormous waste of one’s time and energy not to take advantage of labour saving devices in the uplift scheme.
('65', 411, 4, 9, 736979) If the villagers, and along with them the uplift workers, have to husk and grind, there will hardly be leisure left for them to attend to anything else for their improvement.
('65', 411, 4, 10, 737154) Besides, if the primitive methods were revived, the men will take up the work in the first flush of enthusiasm; but ultimately the brunt of the whole work, I mean husking and grinding, will fall on us, women, and there will be a setback to the little progress we have already made.
('65', 411, 4, 11, 737436) Underlying this argument is a fallacy.
('65', 411, 4, 12, 737475) There is no question of refusing to take advantage of labour saving devices.
('65', 411, 4, 13, 737552) If the vilIagers had enough to eat and to clothe themselves with, there would be no cause for home grinding or home husking, assuming that the question of health was not of any importance or, if it was, there was no difference between home ground flour and millground, or home husked rice and mill husked.
('65', 411, 4, 14, 737858) But the problem is that the villagers became idle when they left off husking and grinding even for their own use, and made no good use of their idle hours whether for uplift or otherwise.
('65', 411, 4, 15, 738046) A starving man or woman who has time on his or her hand will surely be glad to earn an honest anna during that time, for, he or she will resent being advised to save his or her labour when either can turn it into a few pice to alleviate starvation.
('65', 411, 5, 16, 738295) 1 Vide “Statement to the Press”, pp.
('65', 412, 0, 1, 738332) VOL. 65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 413
('65', 412, 1, 2, 738383) correspondent is wrong in thinking that the uplift worker has either to grind or husk.
('65', 412, 1, 3, 738470) He has certainly to learn the art and know the tools, so that he can suggest improvements and understand the limitations of the tools.
('65', 412, 1, 4, 738605) She is wrong, again, in thinking that in the first flush of enthusiasm men will be called upon to grind or husk or will perform these tasks of their own accord and ultimately let the brunt fall on the shoulders of women.
('65', 412, 1, 5, 738826) The fact is that husking and grinding was the prerogative of women, and tens of thousands made a living out of this task, which was both dignified and invigorative.
('65', 412, 1, 6, 738991) Now they are perforce idle, because the vast majority of them have not been able to find another employment in the place of these two, which we have snatched away from them.
('65', 412, 1, 7, 739165) When the fair friend writes about the “little progress” that the women have already made, she has undoubtedly the icitydwellers in mind, for the village life is entirely untouched by uplift workers.
('65', 412, 1, 8, 739364) The majority of them do not even know how the women or men live in the 7,00,000 villages of this vast land.
('65', 412, 1, 9, 739472) We little know how they have deteriorated for want of nourishing food and protective clothing.
('65', 412, 1, 10, 739567) And we little know how, being fed on innutritious rice or flour,which are their staple, they and their children lose stamina and what little vitality they have.
('65', 412, 1, 11, 739728) I have no partiality for return to the primitive method of grinding and husking for the sake of them.
('65', 412, 1, 12, 739830) I suggest the return, because there is no other way of giving employment to the millions of villagers who are living in idleness.
('65', 412, 1, 13, 739960) In my opinion, village uplift is impossible, unless we solve the pressing economic distress.
('65', 412, 1, 14, 740053) Therefore, to induce the villagers to utilize their idle hours is in itself solid uplift work.
('65', 412, 1, 15, 740148) I invite the fair correspondent and those who feel like her to go to some villages, live there for some time in the midst of the villagers and try to live like them, and they will soon perceive the soundness of my argument.

('65', 413, 1, 2, 740434) 508. WHAT IS IT?
('65', 413, 2, 3, 740451) An esteemed friend wrote the orher day saying, among other things, that he had not before his mind’s eye a full picture of what I meant by village industries work.
('65', 413, 2, 4, 740615) It was a good question.
('65', 413, 2, 5, 740639) It must have occurred to many people.
('65', 413, 2, 6, 740677) This is the purport of what I wrote to him: In a nutshell, of the things we use, we should restrict our purchases to the articles which villages manufacture.
('65', 413, 2, 7, 740835) Their manufactures may be crude.
('65', 413, 2, 8, 740868) We must try to induce them to improve their workmanship, and not dismiss them because foreign articles or even articles produced in cities, that is, big factories, are superior.
('65', 413, 2, 9, 741046) In other words, we should evoke the artistic talent of ~the villager.
('65', 413, 2, 10, 741116) In this manner shall we repay somewhat the debt we owe to them.
('65', 413, 2, 11, 741180) We need not be frightened by the thought whether we shall ever succeed in such an effort.
('65', 413, 2, 12, 741270) Within our own times we can recall instances where we have not been baffled by the difficulty of our tasks when we have known that they were essential for the nation’s progress.
('65', 413, 2, 13, 741448) If, therefore, we as individuals believe that revivification of India’s villages is a necessity of our existence, if we believe that thereby only can we root out untouchability and feel one with all, no matter to what community or religion they may belong, we must mentally go back to the villages and treat them as our pattern, instead of putting the city life before them for imitation.
('65', 413, 2, 14, 741837) If this is the correct attitude, then, naturally, we begin with ourselves and thus use, say, handmade paper instead of mill made, use village reed, wherever possible, instead of the fountain pen or the penholder, ink made in the villages instead of the big factories, etc.
('65', 413, 2, 15, 742110) I can multiply instances of this nature.
('65', 413, 2, 16, 742151) There is hardly anything of daily use in the home which the villagers have not made before and cannot make even now.
('65', 413, 2, 17, 742268) If we perform the mental trick and fix our gaze upon them, we immediately put millions of rupees into the pockets of the villagers, whereas at the present moment we are exploiting the villagers without making any return worth the name.
('65', 413, 2, 18, 742504) It is time we arrested the progress of the tragedy.
('65', 413, 2, 19, 742556) To me, the campaign against untouchability has begun to imply ever so much more than the eradication of the ceremonial untouchability of those who are labelled untouchables.
('65', 413, 2, 20, 742730) For the city dweller, the villages have become untouchable.
('65', 413, 2, 21, 742790) He does not know them, he will not live in them.

('65', 414, 1, 2, 742890) he finds himself in a village, he will want to reproduce the city life there.
('65', 414, 1, 3, 742968) This would be tolerable, if we could bring into being cities which would accommodate 30 crores of human beings.
('65', 414, 1, 4, 743080) This is much more impossible than the one of reviving the village industries and stopping the progressive poverty, which is due as much to enforced unemployment as to any other cause.

('65', 416, 10, 23, 746644) You have misinterpreted my advice about forgetting Prabhavati.
('65', 416, 10, 24, 746707) All I had meant was that you should forget her for just one year, as you had to do while you were in America.
('65', 416, 10, 25, 746817) I knew nothing about leave of absence.
('65', 416, 10, 26, 746856) Prabhavati is not here for a job.
('65', 416, 10, 27, 746890) If you cannot feed her and nor can I, Brijkishore Babu certainly can.
('65', 416, 10, 28, 746960) If she is staying here, it is for future service.

('65', 417, 1, 2, 747113) Maybe I am to blame for Prabha not being free in her thoughts.
('65', 417, 1, 3, 747176) But our society is more to blame.
('65', 417, 1, 4, 747210) However, how many people are free in their thinking?
('65', 417, 1, 5, 747263) The poor Hindu woman never considers herself a free person.
('65', 417, 1, 6, 747323) I have rarely seen a woman, even an old widow, who thinks of herself as free.
('65', 417, 1, 7, 747401) Then why do you blame Prabha and why do you blame me?
('65', 417, 1, 8, 747455) Since our ideals are different I can understand your finding the Ashram routine repugnant.
('65', 417, 1, 9, 747546) In fact I am pleasantly surprised that you nevertheless permit Prabha’s remaining in the Ashram.
('65', 417, 1, 10, 747643) I am in a quandary.
('65', 417, 1, 11, 747663) Prabha does not wish to leave either me or the Ashram.
('65', 417, 1, 12, 747718) How then can I push her out?
('65', 417, 1, 13, 747747) I want that Prabha should follow you about and the differences which have cropped up between you two should be patched up.
('65', 417, 1, 14, 747870) But if Prabha cherishes certain ideals, those ideals are apparently different from yours.
('65', 417, 1, 15, 747960) For this I am certainly responsible.
('65', 417, 1, 16, 747997) Having lived with me, my ideas and my conduct have certainly made an impression on her.
('65', 417, 1, 17, 748085) Now I do not know what it is right to do.
('65', 417, 1, 18, 748127) Swaroopraniji asks for Prabha’s services.
('65', 417, 1, 19, 748169) If Prabha returns there you will have a talk with her.
('65', 417, 1, 20, 748224) The matter of her returning I have left to her and Jamnalalji.
('65', 417, 1, 21, 748287) I write this at 3.30 in the morning.
('65', 417, 1, 22, 748324) In the course of the day Prabha will discuss the issue with Jamnalalji and decide.
('65', 417, 1, 23, 748407) Your must understand that I do not consider myself a Mahatma and I do not think of the Ashram as something great.
('65', 417, 1, 24, 748521) I am fully aware of the faults of the Ashram and of those who reside here.
('65', 417, 1, 25, 748596) There certainly is some work being done.
('65', 417, 1, 26, 748637) But it hardly deserves any special acclaim on that account.
('65', 417, 1, 27, 748697) It does not seem possible that I shall be able to help you in the matter of your loan.
('65', 417, 1, 28, 748784) I had thought of engaging you in some activity and thus helping you repay the loan.
('65', 417, 1, 29, 748868) But it does not appear likely that you will be agreeable to this.
('65', 417, 1, 30, 748934) It has never seemed to me right for anyone to go begging for loans.
('65', 417, 1, 31, 749002) I had explained to you certain suggestions I had and also written to you.
('65', 417, 1, 32, 749076) Please tell me what you would have me do.
('65', 417, 1, 33, 749118) It will be good if you can improve your health while you are there.
('65', 417, 1, 34, 749186) There is someone who practises nature cure there.
('65', 417, 1, 35, 749236) Would you like to try his treatment?
('65', 417, 1, 36, 749273) If you are so inclined you may write to me.

('65', 418, 3, 4, 749534) BHAISHRI MAVALANKAR, I got your letter.
('65', 418, 3, 5, 749574) It fully satisfies me and relieves me from worry.
('65', 418, 3, 6, 749624) If the dairy does not succeed even after we have borne so much loss for five years, it will be wound up.
('65', 418, 3, 7, 749729) I fully accept what you say regarding Trustees of the Harijan Ashram.
('65', 418, 3, 8, 749799) They should be completely free to manage it in their own way consistently with the basic principles.
('65', 418, 3, 9, 749900) Find some time and discuss all the points with Narahari.
('65', 418, 3, 10, 749957) I know I am imposing a burden on you, and that too when your health is not good enough to shoulder it all.
('65', 418, 3, 11, 750064) But, then, burdens can be imposed only on those who come forward and seek them.
('65', 418, 3, 12, 750144) But please warn me as soon as you feel that it is becoming too heavy.
('65', 418, 3, 13, 750214) You also will be free from the bonds of caste when you become a beggar like me, but won’t your capacity for begging also have increased then?
('65', 418, 3, 14, 750356) Shall I see that happy day in my lifetime?
('65', 418, 3, 15, 750399) However, I shall die with the faith that one day you will embrace complete poverty.

('65', 418, 7, 22, 750682) The latter is for your file.
('65', 418, 7, 23, 750711) That much assurance should be enough for us.
('65', 418, 7, 24, 750756) You should continue to make whatever other collections you can.
('65', 418, 7, 25, 750820) Let me know if you have any suggestion to make regarding either.
('65', 418, 7, 26, 750885) Increase your work only to the extent of your capacity.

('65', 419, 10, 16, 751535) Unrevised December 4, 1934
('65', 419, 12, 17, 751562) I got your letter.
('65', 419, 12, 18, 751581) If I gave wise replies to your questions, would they necessarily be a sign of real wisdom in me?
('65', 419, 12, 19, 751678) None of you would know the [strength of] anger in me.
('65', 419, 12, 20, 751732) I alone can know it.
('65', 419, 12, 21, 751753) I wouldn’t describe as anger what Lilavati or Gangabehn may have observed in me.
('65', 419, 12, 22, 751834) 1 I suppress most of the anger which I feel.
('65', 419, 12, 23, 751879) Gangabehn and others could have seen only what remained of it.
('65', 419, 12, 24, 751942) If I did not let them see even that, I would be a hypocrite or ruin my health and become a mere skeleton.
('65', 419, 12, 25, 752048) That does not happen because I make a conscious effort to control my anger and tread my way through the problems.
('65', 419, 12, 26, 752162) Because I don’t think it necessary to be careful with people who are intimate with me they occasionally get a glimpse of the anger in me, but, being kind to me, they forget it.
('65', 419, 13, 27, 752339) 1 Gandhiji had refused both of them permission to attend the Congress session.
('65', 420, 0, 1, 752418) VOL. 65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 421
('65', 420, 1, 2, 752469) Prabhavati will send to you whatever yarn is still lying with me.
('65', 420, 2, 3, 752535) My calculation has turned out to be wrong. Prabhavati is in Bombay at present.
('65', 420, 2, 4, 752614) She has gone there to be of help to Swaruprani and to meet Jayaprakash.
('65', 420, 2, 5, 752686) What you believe about .
('65', 420, 2, 6, 752711) 2 is probably not correct.
('65', 420, 2, 7, 752738) Be extremely careful about believing any story against a person.
('65', 420, 2, 8, 752803) It would be better not to listen to such a story at all.
('65', 420, 2, 9, 752860) What can be done about a worker like Dr. Hardikar?
('65', 420, 3, 10, 752911) His views and aims are different from ours.
('65', 420, 3, 11, 752955) The Government will not permit him to carry on the activity which is dear to his heart, and he cannot take interest in the other activities which are going on.
('65', 420, 3, 12, 753115) A person can participate in popular activities only if he can adjust himself within their framework.
('65', 420, 3, 13, 753216) A person like Dr. Hardikar should take up some occupation and do what service he can while engaged in it.
('65', 420, 3, 14, 753322) I have been advising many people to do this.
('65', 420, 3, 15, 753367) People who follow an occupation honestly also serve the country.
('65', 420, 3, 16, 753432) Those who claim to be servants of the people may in fact be a burden on them whereas people who earn a livelihood by following an occupation may be true servants.
('65', 420, 3, 17, 753595) You are right in what you say regarding your letters.
('65', 420, 3, 18, 753649) You can write “Private” on letters intended exclusively for me.
('65', 420, 3, 19, 753713) As regards letters which you leave to me to deal with, I shall dispose of them as I like.
('65', 420, 3, 20, 753803) I rarely preserve the letters which I receive.
('65', 420, 3, 21, 753850) You may do what is possible regarding crafts.
('65', 420, 3, 22, 753896) I hope Deo will not change your place of work too frequently.
('65', 420, 4, 23, 753958) You can do some work only if you remain steady in one place.
('65', 420, 4, 24, 754019) If the place where you are living now is but a suburb of Poona’ you will not be able to do much useful work there.
('65', 420, 4, 25, 754134) However, since you have been working there, I hope you will not be asked to leave it too soon.
('65', 420, 5, 26, 754229) 1 The addressee had asked for yarn spun by Gandhiji in Yeravda Mandir from the slivers supplied by her.
('65', 420, 5, 27, 754333) 2 The name has been omitted.
('65', 420, 5, 28, 754362) 3 Dr. Hardikar’s co workers who had given up their professions, etc., at the time of the Civil Disobedience Movement were in a miserable plight when the movement was withdrawn and Hardikar himself could be of no help.
('65', 420, 5, 29, 754580) 4 Shankarrao Deo wanted to move his Ashram to a small village as Saswad where it was established was the headquarters of a taluk.
('65', 421, 0, 1, 754710) 422 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 421, 1, 2, 754752) don’t attach much importance to my advice in this matter.
('65', 421, 1, 3, 754810) If you think that it was a mistake to have gone there, you certainly need not cling to the place.
('65', 421, 1, 4, 754908) A mistake must be rectified when it is realized.
('65', 421, 1, 5, 754957) Who am I to secure swaraj for the country through ahimsa?
('65', 421, 1, 6, 755015) If I have real ahimsa in me it cannot but prove infectious.
('65', 421, 1, 7, 755075) I have little faith in myself, but my faith in ahimsa is unshakable.
('65', 421, 1, 8, 755144) The world has recognized it as a great principle, but it has rarely been acted upon.
('65', 421, 1, 9, 755229) I daily get a fresh experience of its sweetness, for to me it is the only wish fulfilling tree.
('65', 421, 1, 10, 755325) No other way is possible for me, for I have found no other means of attaining Satyanarayana 1 and life without the prospect of attaining Him has no meaning for me.
('65', 421, 1, 11, 755489) Hence the path of ahimsa, whether difficult or easy, is the only one that I can follow.
('65', 421, 1, 12, 755577) If violence breaks out after my death, you may conclude that my ahimsa was very imperfect or was not real at all—but not that the principle of ahimsa was wrong.
('65', 421, 1, 13, 755738) or it may also be that we shall have to cross the river of blood in which the wicked suffer for their sins before we reach the goal of ahimsa.
('65', 421, 1, 14, 755881) Ahimsa came into politics in the 1920s.
('65', 421, 1, 15, 755921) But didn’t the Chauri Chaura 2 and other outrages occur after that, and hasn’t the Government gone to extreme lengths of repression?
('65', 421, 1, 16, 756054) I am sure, however, that despite all this violence, ahimsa has had a profound effect on people.
('65', 421, 1, 17, 756150) But it has been no more than a drop in the ocean.
('65', 421, 1, 18, 756200) My experiment continues and is ever growing in its scope.
('65', 421, 1, 19, 756258) May your faith never waver!
('65', 421, 1, 20, 756286) Our senses do not always perceive the truth.
('65', 421, 1, 21, 756331) Very often what they perceive is utterly false.
('65', 421, 1, 22, 756379) That is why the path of non attachment was discovered.
('65', 421, 1, 23, 756434) To cultivate non attachment means to rise above the senses.
('65', 421, 1, 24, 756494) one can do that only by overcoming one’s attachment to objects of the senses.
('65', 421, 1, 25, 756572) If we believe the evidence of the eyes, would it not prove that the earth was flat?
('65', 421, 1, 26, 756656) And doesn’t the sun seem to be only a golden disc?
('65', 421, 1, 27, 756707) If the Prema that my eyes see was the true Prema, what a wretch would I be!
('65', 421, 1, 28, 756783) And suppose you believed all that you heard against me!
('65', 421, 1, 29, 756839) I think I have written enough.
('65', 421, 1, 30, 756870) Mirabehn’s alarm has sounded.
('65', 421, 1, 31, 756900) The bell for prayer will soon be given.
('65', 421, 1, 32, 756940) You may draw from this whatever picture you can [of my state of mind].
('65', 421, 1, 33, 757011) I am thinking of

('65', 422, 5, 8, 757483) December 4, 1934
('65', 422, 6, 9, 757500) SHARMA, I got your letter yesterday.
('65', 422, 6, 10, 757537) That might possibly help in locating the articles.
('65', 422, 6, 11, 757588) All that you have written is enough to institute a search.
('65', 422, 6, 12, 757647) How can I call you here for this task?
('65', 422, 6, 13, 757686) one strong reason for your going there is to be with and serve Draupadi and the children.
('65', 422, 6, 14, 757776) This is the beginning of your training and this is how naturopathy starts.
('65', 422, 6, 15, 757851) And now you write that you would live in a room in Dr. Ansari’s house if he agrees to it.
('65', 422, 6, 16, 757941) That too leaving behind Draupadi and Krishna who is reduced to a mere skeleton !
('65', 422, 6, 17, 758022) No, your education, your duty today lies in doing whatever is possible while living with Draupadi and the children.
('65', 422, 6, 18, 758138) Take them away to some village near Khurja and live there.
('65', 422, 6, 19, 758197) If not there then somewhere else in the countryside.
('65', 422, 6, 20, 758250) Krishnan Nair lives at Narela near Delhi.
('65', 422, 6, 21, 758292) He is a good man, you can live with him too, i.e., he might keep you with him or find some place for you.
('65', 422, 6, 22, 758398) In any case you are not going to live with your brothers in Khurja.
('65', 422, 6, 23, 758466) 1 Your brother who is helping you will continue to do so wherever you might live.
('65', 422, 6, 24, 758548) Let me know his income.
('65', 422, 6, 25, 758572) Amtul wants to undertake some work in collaboration with you.
('65', 422, 6, 26, 758634) If you can live in a village, this wish of hers can also be fulfilled.
('65', 422, 6, 27, 758705) She wants to serve Draupadi and the children but this has nothing to do with your living in the countryside.
('65', 422, 6, 28, 758814) I hope you will not tell me that your studies have been interrupted because you have not received your anatomy books.
('65', 422, 7, 29, 758932) 1 The family house lacked air ant sunshine.
('65', 423, 0, 1, 758976) 424 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 423, 1, 2, 759018) matter when you get the books, by leading a well regulated life, you are certainly going ahead with your training.
('65', 423, 1, 3, 759133) Giving up all suspicion also does help.
('65', 423, 1, 4, 759173) Look, the reason why Jnanoba was not brought before me was to save me [the trouble].
('65', 423, 1, 5, 759258) As the shawl was already found, there was no need to see him.
('65', 423, 1, 6, 759320) I had myself sent Kishorelal down to you.
('65', 423, 1, 7, 759362) Similarly, the incident involving Kamalnayan and Mogheji.
('65', 423, 1, 8, 759420) Amtul was present during their conversation, she heard all.
('65', 423, 1, 9, 759480) She says that Kamalnayan and Mogheji were simply jesting and they did not mean to express pleasure at your departure.
('65', 423, 1, 10, 759598) 1 Possibly they were neither sorry nor pleased at your leaving.
('65', 423, 1, 11, 759662) One desirous of becoming a naturopath is not suspicious of anyone, is not hasty and does not brood over another person’s fault He should daily ponder over this couplet of Tulsidas:
('65', 423, 2, 12, 759843) God has endowed this world of sentient and insentient beings with good qualities as well as bad.
('65', 423, 2, 13, 759940) Good men take in only the good qualities leaving behind the impurities like the swan that drinks only milk leaving behind the water mixed with it.
('65', 423, 3, 14, 760087) Only then can he treat other people or correctly diagnose their ailments.
('65', 423, 3, 15, 760161) If Ramdas comes along he will travel with me.
('65', 423, 3, 16, 760207) I shall see what happens.
('65', 423, 3, 17, 760233) How are you spending your time these days?
('65', 423, 3, 18, 760276) What are you reading?
('65', 423, 3, 19, 760298) You have plenty of books, I suppose.
('65', 423, 3, 20, 760335) I have received a prompt refusal from Delhi; now further correspondence is going on.
('65', 423, 3, 21, 760420) Let us see what happens.

('65', 424, 9, 21, 761390) What I want you to do is without interference with your work to tell me: (1) What are the capabilities in your part of the world of revival in the direction indicated by me?
('65', 424, 9, 22, 761564) (2)Who can, in your opinion, take charge of the various districts?
('65', 424, 9, 23, 761631) They must be practically wholetimers and yet able, if possible, to pay their way and make the agency self supporting.
('65', 424, 9, 24, 761749) This concern should not be run at a loss.
('65', 424, 9, 25, 761791) (3) Do you want to take up your own district?

('65', 425, 9, 17, 762800) MY DEAR MALKANI, Gandhi Seva Sangh is framing a new constitution.
('65', 425, 9, 18, 762866) It has decided to incur no fresh obligations.
('65', 425, 9, 19, 762912) It will enlist workers who hold common ideals without needing to share a common purse.
('65', 425, 9, 20, 762999) Jamnalalji has taken up burdens which he, the sole collector, cannot hope to discharge for all time.
('65', 425, 9, 21, 763100) The Sangh itself will crumble to pieces under such a weight.
('65', 425, 9, 22, 763161) You must therefore draw from the Hariian Sangh so long as you are in it.
('65', 425, 9, 23, 763234) And there is nothing wrong in it when you are giving the whole of your time to it.
('65', 425, 9, 24, 763317) Draw your dependents also in it and what you are taking will never appear heavy.
('65', 425, 9, 25, 763398) More when we meet, if we do.
('65', 425, 9, 26, 763427) The ‘if, is there, because there is no certainty about Ghanshyamdas’s coming there even after 15th.
('65', 425, 9, 27, 763527) And I do not come if he is not there.

('65', 426, 4, 5, 763715) If you have got a copy of the Maganlal Memorial appeal 1 and the names of the Trustees that were announced, please send it to me.
('65', 426, 4, 6, 763845) The idea is to have the Memorial opened here as, you may remember, was the suggestion made by Jamnalalji.
('65', 426, 4, 7, 763951) There should be a Hall in which all the processes from picking of cotton to ginning would be on view as the centre, and the village industries surrounding these things.
('65', 426, 4, 8, 764120) The idea would be also to have the office of the Village Industries Association there, and if possible the A. I. S. A. office also on the same ground.
('65', 426, 4, 9, 764271) How does the whole thing appeal to you?

('65', 426, 8, 14, 764407) DEAR CHITRAVSHASTRI,
('65', 426, 9, 15, 764428) I had your telegram.
('65', 426, 9, 16, 764449) I know nothing of Muslim demon strations in Sind extolling Nathuram’s murder.
('65', 426, 9, 17, 764527) My horror of any murder is well known.
('65', 426, 9, 18, 764566) Undoubtedly the murder of Nathuram was bad, and doubly bad in the manner it was committed.
('65', 426, 9, 19, 764657) But my disapproval, and for that matter yours, is surely of no consequence, Any disapproval to be effective must surely come from Mussalmans.

('65', 430, 9, 12, 768295) [GANDHIJI:] Khan Saheb, this is not an occasion when we may not offer defence.
('65', 430, 9, 13, 768374) We must engage our own lawyer and offer defence.
('65', 430, 10, 14, 768423) The Khan Saheb said, “That may be, but I am averse to defending myself in a law court.
('65', 430, 10, 15, 768510) Ever since 1919 you have taught us not to recognize the law courts and I should hate this time to do otherwise.” I quite see, but we do not want to go to jail now if we can help it and hence I would urge you to engage a lawyer.

('65', 430, 12, 22, 769239) Gandhiji asked her to bring them upstairs.
('65', 430, 12, 23, 769282) “The D. S. P. came up and told Gandhiji that he had a warrant of arrest for Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan from the Presidency Magistrate of Bombay.
('65', 430, 12, 24, 769424) Gandhiji asked for the warrant and read it out to Khan Saheb.
('65', 430, 12, 25, 769486) It was on a charge under Section 124 A, there being no mention of any speech or writing in question.
('65', 430, 12, 26, 769587) on the D. S. P. asking Khan saheb as to when he would be ready he said he was quite ready.
('65', 430, 12, 27, 769678) But Gandhiji said that if the D. S. P. did not mind Khan Saheb would see his brother and children at Seth Jamnalal’s place.

('65', 431, 4, 5, 769903) I am posting a letter to you [in a] separate cover written by Father.
('65', 431, 4, 6, 769973) After he had written the letter, he was arrested in my presence and taken to Bombay.
('65', 431, 4, 7, 770058) There he would be tried under Section 124 A. You would not be disturbed by the news.
('65', 431, 4, 8, 770143) Prisons are our second or rather real home.
('65', 431, 4, 9, 770187) I expect a long letter from you telling me how you are doing there.
('65', 431, 4, 10, 770255) Did you receive the letter I sent to you at Lucknow?

('65', 431, 9, 15, 770407) MY DEAR CHOITHRAM,
('65', 431, 10, 16, 770426) I have your letter.
('65', 431, 10, 17, 770446) I am not sure that any propaganda will be of any service to you.
('65', 431, 10, 18, 770511) In any case you cannot have Khan Saheb now.
('65', 431, 10, 19, 770555) He is under arrest.
('65', 431, 10, 20, 770575) Remember we do not want to court arrest just now.
('65', 431, 10, 21, 770625) We have to become speechless manual labourers working in the villages.
('65', 431, 10, 22, 770696) Speech making must be reserved for the few in the Assembly and therefore it must be confined to a few.
('65', 431, 10, 23, 770799) I hope you are keeping yourself fit.

('65', 432, 3, 4, 770968) PRABHAVATI,
('65', 432, 4, 5, 770980) I have your letter.
('65', 432, 4, 6, 771000) It arrived today.
('65', 432, 4, 7, 771018) Since it is dated the 6th, I should have got it yesterday.
('65', 432, 4, 8, 771077) You will probably read what I have written to Mummy 1. I have told her that she should discuss the matter with you and come to some arrangement convenient to you both.
('65', 432, 4, 9, 771245) Whatever the circumstances, you ought to be sent for a few days to hand over charge.
('65', 432, 4, 10, 771330) The rest when we meet.
('65', 432, 4, 11, 771353) I hope Jayaprakash is all right:
('65', 432, 5, 12, 771386) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] Andrews arrived today.
('65', 432, 5, 13, 771435) Khurshedbehn will arrive on Monday.
('65', 432, 5, 14, 771471) There was a letter from Gopi for you, saying that she was all right.
('65', 432, 5, 15, 771540) You must have read about Khan Saheb’s arrest.

('65', 433, 2, 3, 772370) December 8, 1934
('65', 433, 3, 4, 772387) NARAHARI,
('65', 433, 4, 5, 772397) I have your letter.
('65', 433, 4, 6, 772417) The money given by Bhai Mavalankar and Ranchhodbhai for the dairy is welcome.
('65', 433, 4, 7, 772495) I had a letter from Ambalalbhai saying that he did intend to pay the loss up to December 31. You may, therefore, spend just now from the money received from Mavalankar and Ranchhodbhai, but credit the sum .
('65', 433, 4, 8, 772702) to next year’s account.
('65', 433, 4, 9, 772726) Similarly, when you get the money from Ambalalbhai, you will have to return to me the Rs. 1,000 which I sent.
('65', 433, 4, 10, 772836) The account will balance then.
('65', 433, 4, 11, 772867) Send the figure of the loss up to December end to me first and then to Ambalalbhai.
('65', 433, 4, 12, 772951) If I am in jail by that time, follow the instructions given in this letter.
('65', 433, 4, 13, 773027) When drawing up the account to determine the amount of the loss, let me know the sums, if any, that you may have received from other sources.
('65', 433, 4, 14, 773169) We should not include any of them in the amount to be paid by Ambalalbhai.
('65', 433, 4, 15, 773244) One such sum, for instance, is that received for the Goseva Sangh and [utilized for the dairy] as suggested by yourself.
('65', 433, 4, 16, 773365) I have written briefly about this to Narandas also.
('65', 433, 4, 17, 773417) He doesn’t know about your last letter.
('65', 433, 4, 18, 773457) Ratilal indeed has had a narrow escape.
('65', 433, 4, 19, 773497) I hope the thief will be caught.
('65', 433, 4, 20, 773530) Advise Prabhashankar to strengthen a little the guard at the bungalow.
('65', 433, 4, 21, 773601) He may ask for legitimate help from the police.
('65', 433, 4, 22, 773649) If Ratilal feels afraid, spare a room for him in the Ashram.
('65', 433, 4, 23, 773710) It should be given on rent.
('65', 433, 4, 24, 773738) If any cash or valuables are being kept in the bungalow, I have already suggested that they should be removed.

('65', 434, 7, 10, 774382) GENTLEMEN,
('65', 434, 8, 11, 774393) I got your letter yesterday afternoon in the midst of an important interview.
('65', 434, 8, 12, 774471) I was able to read it only at 3 a.m.
('65', 434, 8, 13, 774508) I have taken the deepest interest in your invention.
('65', 434, 8, 14, 774561) I have great regard for Mr. Kale both as a mechanic and a man.
('65', 434, 8, 15, 774624) I felt drawn to him when he was at the Ashram.
('65', 434, 8, 16, 774671) Being a fairly busy man, I had not much time to give to the examination of the machine, but I have kept myself in touch with the progress of the examination by the Judges 2. When you offered to send it to me I told you of my own difficulty.
('65', 434, 8, 17, 774912) But I was pressed by a friend to give the machine a trial myself.
('65', 434, 8, 18, 774978) I, therefore, wrote to you again 3 asking you to send the machine with Mr. Kale and another who might know all about tools in general.
('65', 434, 8, 19, 775113) I had intended to keep the machine here for some time so that the Director of the Ashram Shri Vinoba might also try it.
('65', 434, 8, 20, 775233) The prize of Rs. 1,00,000 is at the disposal of him who would earn it.
('65', 434, 8, 21, 775304) I am personally anxious to give it, if the machine of my dream can be had.
('65', 434, 8, 22, 775379) The highest speed attained on the ordinary wheel is over 700 yards per hour.
('65', 434, 8, 23, 775456) Besides yours, there are two machines of promise.
('65', 434, 8, 24, 775506) They are also undergoing improvements.

('65', 435, 1, 3, 775815) My movement becomes uncertain thereafter.
('65', 435, 1, 4, 775857) I shall gladly try the machine myself if I succeed in returning to Wardha and if you will then entertain my request to send your machine.
('65', 435, 1, 5, 775995) I intend to interest you in the Village Industries scheme and help it through your organization by suggesting or making improvements in the village tools, especially the indigenous village chakki for grinding wheat, etc., the rice pounder, the oil press and the cane crusher.
('65', 435, 1, 6, 776271) If, however, you will entertain my request, I would like you to do so as comrades in a common humanitarian cause and not as commercial men suspecting the bona fides of public men who seek to tempt houses like yours to interest yourselves in inventions of benefit to millions of starving villagers.

('65', 435, 7, 14, 776708) I wonder how far you have answered the “National Call” and respected private friendship by publishing unfinished and unauthorized garbled version about the correspondence I am carrying on with the authorities.
('65', 435, 7, 15, 776918) If you think you have advanced the national cause thereby, I have nothing to say.
('65', 435, 7, 16, 777000) It would have been wise, if you had referred the matter to me as sometimes even strangers do.

('65', 436, 4, 6, 777372) Fortunately I have your book also sent to me for which too, kindly accept my thanks.
('65', 436, 4, 7, 777457) Your letter gave me great joy in that there was in it promise of your support to my humble effort on behalf of the villagers.
('65', 436, 4, 8, 777583) I have no difficulty whatsoever in endorsing your remarks about heavy industries.
('65', 436, 4, 9, 777665) I know that the heavy industries cannot be organized without power driven machinery.
('65', 436, 4, 10, 777750) I can have no quarrel with such use of machinery.
('65', 436, 4, 11, 777800) My objection comes in when such machinery displaces human labour without providing displaced hands with a substitute at least as good as displaced labour.

('65', 436, 9, 16, 778088) DEAR FRIEND,
('65', 436, 10, 17, 778101) I have your letter of 19th November.
('65', 436, 10, 18, 778138) I have not been able to understand it, in spite of the help I sought from Charlie Andrews.
('65', 436, 10, 19, 778229) I have no hesitation in agreeing with you that any solution of the present deadlock should be just and creative, and that it should be neither imposed nor extorted; in other words, it should be an agreed solution honourable to both the countries.
('65', 436, 10, 20, 778476) I know too the suffering of India and the suffering of Lancashire.
('65', 436, 10, 21, 778543) But if the juxtaposition of the two is meant to imply that the cause of the suffering of either is identical I would dissent from any such view.
('65', 436, 10, 22, 778688) The suffering of India is imposed upon her; the suffering of Lancashire is due partly to world causes and partly to its own shortsightedness and selfishness.
('65', 436, 10, 23, 778846) So far as it was possible for me to suggest an alleviation of the

('65', 437, 1, 2, 779068) suffering of Lancashire through India’s help I had made a definite offer 1 when I was in England in 1931. But my offer proved to be of no avail.
('65', 437, 1, 3, 779213) The offer was this: If there was a free settlement between England and India, a favoured nation clause was quite possible, in so far as India might need any foreign cloth in order to supplement her output of cloth, whether through the village spinning wheel or through her mills.
('65', 437, 1, 4, 779493) I do not know how far such treatment is possible today for, even during the short period that has elapsed since the meeting of the Round Table Conference, India has become better organized for the manufacture of all her clothing requirements, in spite of the fact that she is importing fine count calico both from England and Japan.
('65', 437, 1, 5, 779826) The chief point, however, is not how Lancashire can send its calico to India, but how the whole of England can benefit in every way by the benefit that India must derive from attainment of complete freedom, political and economic.
('65', 437, 1, 6, 780057) The more I study the villages of India the more intensely do I realize that India has no need to be a pauper country if she can get the chance to grow without the fetters that today prevent hernatural natural growth.
('65', 437, 1, 7, 780274) Your last paragraph seems to imply that there is no longer any repression in India.
('65', 437, 1, 8, 780358) I can only tell you that repression is there to be seen by anyone with the naked eye.
('65', 437, 1, 9, 780444) I do not know of any single repressive law that has been repealed.
('65', 437, 1, 10, 780511) The Press is effectively gagged, there is no such thing as freedom of movement in Bengal as also in the Frontier Province.
('65', 437, 1, 11, 780634) If you hear nothing of imprisonments and lathi charges it is because civil disobedience is suspended and the Congress has resolved, in furtherance of the spirit of non violence, to submit to repressive laws in so far as it is humanly possible to do so.
('65', 437, 1, 12, 780887) on the top of all this comes the Parliamentary Committee’s proposals for a new constitution.
('65', 437, 1, 13, 780980) It is, as I read it, a barefaced denial of freedom.
('65', 437, 1, 14, 781032) I see in it no scope for expansion.
('65', 437, 1, 15, 781068) I would any day prefer the existing state to the crushing burden that threatens to overwhelm India and tighten the British hold upon her.
('65', 437, 1, 16, 781206) My own power of endurance is being tested beyond my capacity.
('65', 437, 1, 17, 781268) My way to the Frontier Province is blocked.
('65', 437, 1, 18, 781312) But, in spite of the blackness of the horizon, I have no sense of despair in me.

('65', 438, 1, 5, 781760) But she will do so chiefly if her own sons and daughters behave themselves and prove worthy of her freedom.

('65', 439, 2, 3, 783105) December 10, 1934
('65', 439, 3, 4, 783123) MANILAL AND SUSHILA, I got your letters.
('65', 439, 3, 5, 783164) You should not expect any article from me just now.
('65', 439, 3, 6, 783216) I can’t even think what to write.
('65', 439, 3, 7, 783250) I do not know the situation there.
('65', 439, 3, 8, 783285) I do believe, however, that the Agent should stay.
('65', 439, 3, 9, 783336) Whether he is a good or a bad one will depend on our luck.
('65', 439, 3, 10, 783395) But if there were to be no Agent, nothing could be done.
('65', 439, 3, 11, 783452) What is to be done if none of you knows the art of using the Agent well?
('65', 439, 3, 12, 783525) Or probably experience will teach you that art.
('65', 439, 3, 13, 783573) It will be enough if you yourself keep away from intrigues.
('65', 439, 3, 14, 783633) Should I take it as certain now that you won’t send a permit for Ramdas?

('65', 439, 8, 19, 783821) RAOJIBHAI, This is no time to ask me to send messages.
('65', 439, 8, 20, 783876) It would be best to let me do my work and deduce what message you can from it.
('65', 439, 8, 21, 783955) It is better to demonstrate one’s message through one’s work rather than say it in words Who else will take up the work of reviving village industries if not Patidar young men and women?
('65', 439, 8, 22, 784142) What can be better education than such work?
('65', 439, 8, 23, 784187) He is an educated man who multiplies one pie into two by honest means and does for the country work of greater value than the cost of the khadi that he wears.

('65', 440, 5, 14, 785185) Why should we waste our time In guessing the reasons for Khan Saheb’s arrest?
('65', 440, 5, 15, 785263) There is one obvious reason.
('65', 440, 5, 16, 785292) They cannot put up with his dynamism.
('65', 440, 5, 17, 785330) My jail going will be postponed.
('65', 440, 5, 18, 785363) It seems, however, that ultimately there will be no alternative to it.
('65', 440, 5, 19, 785434) I intend to leave Wardha on the 18th or the 19th.
('65', 440, 5, 20, 785484) Wherever they lodge me, at the moment I feel that they must give me facilities for Harijan work.
('65', 440, 5, 21, 785581) 2 is thinking things out for himself at the moment.
('65', 440, 5, 22, 785633) I am hopeful, however, that after he has stumbled often enough he will come round.

('65', 440, 5, 24, 785756) The Lord will do as He pleases; He knows better.

('65', 442, 3, 6, 787555) All are full of your moods.
('65', 442, 3, 7, 787583) For my part there is no question of any suspicion.
('65', 442, 3, 8, 787634) For me the foremost task is to see you well adjusted.
('65', 442, 3, 9, 787688) You are the one who harbours suspicions.
('65', 442, 3, 10, 787729) What have I written that you read my suspicion in it?
('65', 442, 3, 11, 787783) I am in every way trying to arrange for your training.
('65', 442, 3, 12, 787838) I have already written to Dr. Ansari.
('65', 442, 3, 13, 787876) Tell me what more I am to do.
('65', 442, 3, 14, 787906) You are indeed undergoing true training.

('65', 442, 3, 16, 788028) What does Krishna’s wasting away and your falling ill indicate?
('65', 442, 3, 17, 788092) What happened to your research talents?

('65', 442, 3, 20, 788220) What are you doing now?

('65', 442, 3, 22, 788312) Your last letter pains me; it seems that you are passing the days in great distress.
('65', 442, 3, 23, 788397) Have you made any arrangements for your children’s education?
('65', 442, 3, 24, 788459) Give me a clear picture of what is happening there.

('65', 442, 3, 26, 788606) Ramdas is not progressing well.
('65', 442, 3, 27, 788638) He is extremely worried and moreover unsteady.
('65', 442, 3, 28, 788685) He is assailed by varying moods.

('65', 443, 3, 4, 789017) Mahatma Gandhi has addressed a letter to Brahmachari T. Ramachandra 2 asking him to suggest names for occupying the position of agents for pursuing the activities of the All India Village Industries Association in Mysore for each of the several .

('65', 443, 6, 9, 789414) December 11, 1934
('65', 443, 7, 10, 789432) It is unfortunate that Press correspondents have thought fit without reference to the parties thereto to publish garbled reports of the correspondence that has been going on between His Excellency the Viceroy and myself with reference to my contemplated visit to the Frontier Province.
('65', 443, 7, 11, 789718) I was pressed by several editors to contradict or confirm the reports.
('65', 443, 7, 12, 789789) The best thing I could do was to seek His Excellency’s permission to publish the correspondence in so far as it has gone.
('65', 443, 7, 13, 789911) Having just received this permission, 3 I release the correspondence to the Press.
('65', 443, 7, 14, 789994) But I would warn the public against thinking that the correspondence is closed and that I am waiting for the first opportunity to court arrest by proceeding to the Frontier in the teeth of His Excellency’s advice to the contrary.
('65', 443, 7, 15, 790224) I have no desire to offer civil disobedience at the present moment.
('65', 443, 7, 16, 790292) My object is as a humble servant of God to meet those in the Frontier who call themselves Servants of God and to know them.
('65', 443, 7, 17, 790416) The urge has become all the greater now that their brave leader is under

('65', 444, 1, 3, 790716) But my immediate object cannot be served by defiance of authority.
('65', 444, 1, 4, 790783) Therefore, I propose to try all possible constitutional means to obtain the necessary permission.
('65', 444, 1, 5, 790881) If suspicion of my motive is the cause of refusal, I shall try to disarm the suspicion.
('65', 444, 1, 6, 790969) My endeavour is to avoid every occasion for civil disobedience of authority, in so far as it is humanly possible to do so.
('65', 444, 1, 7, 791092) I would therefore ask the public in general, and the friends of the Frontier in particular, to hold themselves in patience.
('65', 444, 1, 8, 791216) They will know in proper time what is to happen finally.
('65', 444, 1, 9, 791273) And I would urge the editors of newspapers to respect my wish that they publish nothing concerning my contemplated visit to the Frontier without authority.

('65', 444, 5, 14, 791546) DEAR FRIEND,
('65', 444, 6, 15, 791559) I purposely refrained from sending a reply to your previous letter as it did not call for any.
('65', 444, 6, 16, 791654) The letter received two days ago did require a reply.
('65', 444, 6, 17, 791708) But I was waiting for the arrival of your good wife.
('65', 444, 6, 18, 791761) It was a privilege for me to meet her here.
('65', 444, 6, 19, 791805) The advent of Ambujam has been a blessing to me.
('65', 444, 6, 20, 791854) [She]1 revives old sweet memories and brings me nearer to you as a member of the family.
('65', 444, 6, 21, 791943) I have not had a long chat with her.
('65', 444, 6, 22, 791980) I hope to some time today.
('65', 444, 6, 23, 792007) I have a heavy meeting be[fo]re me [ami]d[st] an otherwise heavy programme for the next two days.
('65', 444, 6, 24, 792105) Ambujam is well and happy.

('65', 445, 4, 5, 792532) I am thankful for your letter.
('65', 445, 4, 6, 792563) It is a matter of great joy to me that in the opinion of both of you, Ambujam has benefited by her stay with me.
('65', 445, 4, 7, 792676) Her only ambition in life seems to be to make herself a useful instrument of service.
('65', 445, 4, 8, 792762) I regard it a privilege to be able to help Ambujam in any way I can.
('65', 445, 4, 9, 792831) And I shall always welcome any suggestion you may make in furtherance of my effort to guide her.

('65', 445, 10, 16, 793058) I got both your letters together.
('65', 445, 10, 17, 793092) I will probably leave on the 19th.
('65', 445, 10, 18, 793127) I had thought that you would arrive here on Sunday.
('65', 445, 10, 19, 793179) What can my influence avail?
('65', 445, 10, 20, 793208) You alone can judge how much your presence is necessary there.
('65', 445, 10, 21, 793271) Is it your job, or mine from this distance, to please Mummy?
('65', 445, 10, 22, 793332) It is not as easy to send for you here now as it was to relieve you.
('65', 445, 10, 23, 793401) For myself, I am eagerly awaiting your arrival, and your work also remains unattended to.

('65', 446, 3, 4, 793687) BHAIZ GHANSHYAMDAS,
('65', 446, 4, 5, 793707) I see that you are endeavouring to reach Delhi under any circumstances before the 20th.
('65', 446, 4, 6, 793795) There is no need for all this troubIe if it is only for my sake.
('65', 446, 4, 7, 793860) You must not rush at the cost of your health.
('65', 446, 4, 8, 793906) One more point arises about my visit.
('65', 446, 4, 9, 793944) Would not my staying with you be risky in view of my recent correspondence with the Viceroy, a garbled version of which has appeared in the Press?
('65', 446, 4, 10, 794091) And the third point: Would you not be subject to pressure of work immediately on your reaching there?
('65', 446, 4, 11, 794193) If you think I must go to Delhi I can go only after four or five days.
('65', 446, 4, 12, 794264) As far as I can see now I can set out on the 19th, reaching there on the 20th.
('65', 446, 4, 13, 794343) Mahadev is writing to you about the rest.
('65', 446, 4, 14, 794385) I have Gopi’s letter which I am enclosing with this.

('65', 446, 9, 20, 794595) BHAI VALLABHBHAI,

('65', 446, 10, 22, 794632) I am sending a fresh statement 1 altogether for Khan Saheb.
('65', 446, 10, 23, 794692) I think it is the on]y proper statement for him to make, and he should make it.
('65', 446, 10, 24, 794772) I am writing to him.
('65', 446, 10, 25, 794793) Read that Ietter.
('65', 446, 10, 26, 794811) I need not write anything more here.
('65', 446, 10, 27, 794848) The apology offered in the statement seems absolutely essential to me.
('65', 446, 10, 28, 794919) But you are the final judge about that and about the whole statement.
('65', 446, 10, 29, 794989) I can say nothing positively from this distance.
('65', 446, 10, 30, 795038) I also feel that a lawyer should be engaged.
('65', 446, 10, 31, 795083) He may read out the statement.
('65', 446, 10, 32, 795114) He should not plead either guilty or not guilty.
('65', 446, 10, 33, 795163) The lawyer should not plead for a lighter

('65', 447, 1, 3, 795365) There is no need at all to cross examine the witnesses.
('65', 447, 1, 4, 795421) But these are my personal views only.
('65', 447, 1, 5, 795459) The final decision about everything rests with you.
('65', 447, 1, 6, 795511) As for me, you know what the position is.
('65', 447, 1, 7, 795553) Andrews has left for Delhi today on that very business.
('65', 447, 1, 8, 795609) He has asked me not to proceed further in the matter meanwhile.
('65', 447, 1, 9, 795673) Details will be given to you by Mathuradas.
('65', 447, 1, 10, 795717) Nothing more need be done for the present regarding Rajendrababu.
('65', 447, 1, 11, 795783) I have received a wire from Ghanshyamdas saying that the doctors do not permit him to leave till the ‘30th.
('65', 447, 1, 12, 795891) I need not, therefore, reach Delhi on the 20th, unless Andrews advises otherwise.
('65', 447, 1, 13, 795973) The meeting of the Working Committee can be called now only in January.
('65', 447, 1, 14, 796045) If you think it proper to attend Balvantrai’s Conference, you may do so.
('65', 447, 1, 15, 796118) I can’t judge about that.
('65', 447, 1, 16, 796144) Tell Abhyankar on my behalf, too, that he should get all right.
('65', 447, 1, 17, 796208) Pyarelal must have arrived there.
('65', 447, 1, 18, 796242) If you require more help, please ask for it.
('65', 447, 1, 19, 796287) If it is possible, send away Prabhavati to Swaruprani.

('65', 447, 3, 28, 796699) Do what you can.

('65', 448, 3, 8, 797277) I advise you to come and meet me here.
('65', 448, 3, 9, 797316) Would you be interested in the work of the Village Industries Association?
('65', 448, 3, 10, 797391) It would be good if you could meet me early for that.
('65', 448, 3, 11, 797445) I keep worrying about Saralabehn.

('65', 448, 8, 24, 797914) Why should the poor be harassed?
('65', 448, 8, 25, 797947) It is improper to delay such matters.

('65', 449, 2, 3, 798395) The Secretary, Harijan Sevak Sangh, Assam, has sent me a copy of the report of the Sangh’s work during the year.
('65', 449, 2, 4, 798508) From the report I abstract the following interesting particulars:
('65', 449, 3, 5, 798574) The Sangh runs 72 schools for boys and girls with 2,365 pupils on the rolls.
('65', 449, 3, 6, 798651) of these, 21 are mixed schools and 4 for girls only.
('65', 449, 4, 7, 798704) The total amount spent on the schools during the year was Rs. 4,495 1 4 O.
('65', 449, 5, 8, 798779) The Sangh recruited 328 boys and girls for the ordinary schools.
('65', 449, 6, 9, 798844) Scholarships totalling Rs. 864 9 0 for Middle English and High English schools were given to Harijan students.
('65', 449, 7, 10, 798955) The total value of books, slates, soaps, clothes given came to Rs. 206 2 6.
('65', 449, 8, 11, 799031) 23 Namghars (prayer houses) were thrown open to Harijans.
('65', 449, 9, 12, 799089) The Jorhat Committee built a common prayer house for Rs. 1,196 9 3.
('65', 449, 10, 13, 799157) The Sangh employed 11 Harijan teachers, including two mistresses.
('65', 449, 11, 14, 799223) A co operative society was organized at Dibrugarh for Bhangis.
('65', 449, 11, 15, 799286) 81 Bhangis have taken up shares.
('65', 449, 11, 16, 799319) Rs. 920 have already been realized.
('65', 449, 12, 17, 799355) The Sangh has organized 9 District Committees.
('65', 449, 12, 18, 799402) These have organized 22 sub committees of Harijans.
('65', 449, 13, 19, 799454) Free medical relief was given, costing Rs. 16 7 O. 40 spinningwheels and ten maunds of cotton for spinning were distributed among poor Harijans.
('65', 449, 14, 20, 799599) 132 villages were toured for anti opium and anti drink propaganda.
('65', 449, 14, 21, 799666) As a result, 154 took pledges, giving up drink, and 15 hemp smoking.
('65', 449, 15, 22, 799735) Municipal Boards of the Province were requested to make better arrangements of housing, drainage and water supply for their employees, especially the sweepers.
('65', 449, 15, 23, 799895) But it is sad to note that none of them took up the work.
('65', 449, 15, 24, 799953) Gauhati and Dibrugarh were the worst offenders.
('65', 449, 16, 25, 800001) By way of contrast, it is pleasurable to note that, at the instance of the itinerant workers, some villages constructed their own roads and cleaned their own tanks.
('65', 449, 17, 26, 800166) 246 villages were surveyed during the year, and statistics of Harijan families as to their condition, professions, disabilities, drinking and opium habits, etc., were collected.
('65', 450, 0, 1, 800344) VOL. 65 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 451
('65', 450, 1, 2, 800395) The President, His Holiness the Satradhikar Goswami of Garmur, toured through most of the important places including the ex tea garden coolie centres.
('65', 450, 1, 3, 800546) In Assam, opium is a very serious problem.
('65', 450, 1, 4, 800589) It ruins the addict physically, morally and materially.
('65', 450, 1, 5, 800645) It has been found that, in 8 districts, the average consumption among 64,459 addicts is nearly 1Ω tolas per head per month.
('65', 450, 1, 6, 800769) In Nowgong, excepting the Mikir Hills, the consumption is about 18 Srs.
('65', 450, 1, 7, 800841) per 10,000, in Lakhimpur it is 62 Srs.
('65', 450, 1, 8, 800880) per 10,000 In Mikir Hills it is even over 62 Srs.
('65', 450, 1, 9, 800930) per 10,000. Harijans are the worst sufferers in Lakhimpur, Sibsagar and Nowgong.
('65', 450, 1, 10, 801011) The main professions of indigenous Harijans are fishing, pottery and goldsmithy.
('65', 450, 1, 11, 801092) The revival movement should result in helping these artisans.
('65', 450, 1, 12, 801154) This encouraging record is marred by the knowledge that over one fourth of the expenses were incurred for administrative and propaganda purposes.
('65', 450, 1, 13, 801300) The total expenditure was Rs. 11,966. of this, Rs. 3,664 represents administration and propaganda, and Rs. 8,302 welfare.
('65', 450, 1, 14, 801422) Administrative staff absorbs Rs. 1,149 and propagandists Rs. 1,020. I have omitted annas and pies.
('65', 450, 1, 15, 801521) Now this expense for welfare work of Rs. 8,302 is much too much in my estimation.
('65', 450, 1, 16, 801603) As I have repeatedly said, constructive work is its own and the best propaganda.
('65', 450, 1, 17, 801684) Administrative staff should also be reduced to a minimum.
('65', 450, 1, 18, 801742) I know that Assam is a difficult province to work [in].
('65', 450, 1, 19, 801798) Nevertheless, the fact that Harijan Sevak Sanghs are an organization of penitents or debtors should ever be borne in mind.

('65', 450, 5, 23, 801975) Being myself a half baked naturopath, I draw to myself similar cranks, of whom Shri Sharma of Khurja is one.
('65', 450, 5, 24, 802084) He had to his credit a Sun and Light Hospital and some well advertised books.
('65', 450, 5, 25, 802162) I had a hand in the disappearance of the Hospital.
('65', 450, 5, 26, 802213) The sequel is told as follows in his own words: 1
('65', 450, 6, 27, 802263) I would like .
('65', 450, 6, 28, 802278) to inform .

('65', 451, 1, 2, 802475) ways of Nature, that is of Truth, I have discovered that all my books on sunlight and colour cannot be held to be reliable beyond doubt.
('65', 451, 1, 3, 802612) I would, therefore, like all those who possess my books, or who might have heard of them, for the time being to dismiss them from their consideration and not to rely upon what I have written therein or upon the invention which I have advertised therein.
('65', 451, 1, 4, 802866) I hope some day .
('65', 451, 1, 5, 802884) to re write the books and place them before the public with confidence based upon verifiable experiments.
('65', 451, 1, 6, 802990) I wish the other naturopaths will take a lesson from Shri Sharma’s example.
('65', 451, 1, 7, 803066) I have written and spoken much against the modern treatment of diseases.
('65', 451, 1, 8, 803139) But I have a sneaking regard for the comparative sanity of allopaths.
('65', 451, 1, 9, 803209) They do not make pretensions.
('65', 451, 1, 10, 803239) The best among them do not refuse to learn from others, and they are humble enough to own their mistakes among themselves, though not to their patients.
('65', 451, 1, 11, 803392) They try to know all about the human body and as much as is possible of the drugs they use.
('65', 451, 1, 12, 803484) Naturopaths use few drugs.
('65', 451, 1, 13, 803511) But an accurate knowledge of the body is surely essential for all who would tamper with it under the pretence of curing it of the many ailments to which it is a prey.
('65', 451, 1, 14, 803678) Shri Sharma has a burning passion for becoming a true naturopath.
('65', 451, 1, 15, 803744) He is, therefore, determined to acquire a working knowledge of anatomy, physiology and whatever is necessary for all who will deal with diseases, whether in the name of allopathy, homoeopathy or naturopathy.
('65', 451, 1, 16, 803952) His notice is a confession and a warning.
('65', 451, 1, 17, 803994) Let all concerned take note.

('65', 451, 4, 21, 804258) After his retirement he used to devote his time to social service.
('65', 451, 4, 22, 804325) And though so old, he had allowed himself to be nominated as Chairman of the local Harijan Sevak Sangh.

('65', 452, 2, 3, 804610) Shri J. K. Mehta, Secretary, Indian Merchants, Chamber, Bombay, writes: 1
('65', 452, 3, 4, 804684) In 1917 my services were borrowed from the Chamber by the Government of India for purposes of the War.
('65', 452, 3, 5, 804787) .I was at Simla for about a year and a half with the Munitions Board.
('65', 452, 3, 6, 804857) It was found that horseshoes could not be made available from the United Kingdom.
('65', 452, 3, 7, 804939) It proved to be a great and complicated problem, as there was no factory in India making horseshoes.
('65', 452, 3, 8, 805040) Ultimately the solution was found in getting supplies from hundreds of villages.
('65', 452, 3, 9, 805121) The village smith came to the rescue of the Government of India, .
('65', 452, 3, 10, 805188) who got horseshoes from different villages and sent them up for the Army requirements.
('65', 452, 3, 11, 805275) Truly, necessity is the mother of invention.
('65', 452, 3, 12, 805320) Why should not we be able to accomplish in our war against enforced idleness and unemployment what had become possible in the time of the great War?
('65', 452, 3, 13, 805469) Instances such as .Shri J. K. Mehta has given can be endlessly multiplied.
('65', 452, 3, 14, 805544) The whole face of the great continent of Europe was changed during those days of mutual slaughter, and men and women, boys and girls had to work with their hands, in order that they might be able to keep body and soul together.

('65', 453, 1, 2, 806474) The Congress resolution 1 in the matter contemplates the question of a self acting, independent and non political organization consisting of men and women whose primary aim in life would be identification with the villagers and promotion of their welfare.
('65', 453, 2, 3, 806730) The following friends, having understood the implications of their obligation, have consented to form the Association of which they become both the foundation members and the first Board of Management:
('65', 453, 3, 4, 806932) Shri Shrikrishnadas Jajooji, President and Treasurer [Shri] J. C. Kumarappa, organizer and Secretary Shrimati Gosibehn Captain Dr. Khan Saheb Shri Shoorji Vallabhdas Dr. Prafulla Ghosh Shri Lakshmidas Purushottam Asar Shri Shankerlal Banker They will have power to add to their number.
('65', 453, 4, 5, 807218) The function of the Board will be to define the programme of village reconstruction work from time to time, to co ordinate the policy followed in different centres, to collect, collate and circulate information gathered from workers or agents as to the actual condition of the existing village industries, both those that may be flourishing and those that may be perishing, also as to the economic, moral and physical condition of villagers, to carry on research work with the help of specialists and experts and to discover and create a market for surplus village manufactures.
('65', 453, 5, 6, 807797) The Board will collect such funds as may be required for the due discharge of its functions.
('65', 453, 5, 7, 807890) As the secret of the success of the policy of this Association will be in making the villagers selfreliant and self supporting, its programme must not be costly.
('65', 453, 5, 8, 808052) The idea is, therefore, to work with as little outlay as possible.
('65', 453, 6, 9, 808119) It follows, therefore, that decentralization must be the keynote of the Board’s policy, and India will be divided into as many areas as there may be workers or agents, who will work, organize and be

('65', 454, 1, 2, 808438) responsible to the Board for the carrying out of its programme in their respective areas.
('65', 454, 1, 3, 808528) The workers or agents will be selected from those who, consistently with their preoccupation of earning their livelihood, will give their whole time to the work of the.
('65', 454, 1, 4, 808697) Association.
('65', 454, 1, 5, 808710) So tar as possible, the agents will be honorary.
('65', 454, 1, 6, 808759) They will collect what funds may be necessary for the organization of their areas.It may be that the Board will not get many unpaid agents.
('65', 454, 1, 7, 808899) It will be satisfied, for a start, even with a few districts which are thoroughly organized and demonstrated to be economically and otherwise successful.
('65', 454, 1, 8, 809053) A list of agents will be published from time to time.
('65', 454, 1, 9, 809107) The Board cannot carry on research work without the help of experts.
('65', 454, 1, 10, 809176) And since experts cannot be expected to give their whole time and thought to the work of the Association, I have sent requests to several friends if they would allow their names to appear on the Board of Advisers.
('65', 454, 1, 11, 809390) So far the following friends have kindly consented to be on it: Dr. Rabindranath Tagore Sir J. C. Bose Sir P. C. Ray Sir C. V. Raman Shri Ramdas Pantulu Jamal Mohamed Sahib Shri G. D. Birla Sir Purushottamdas Thakurdas Sir S. Pochkhanawalla Prof.

('65', 455, 1, 3, 809997) Though I have several names before me of friends who have undertaken to act as agents to the Association, I would request these correspondents as well as others to offer their names to the Organizer and Secretary, Mr. J. C. Kumarappa, Wardha.

('65', 457, 6, 11, 814289) Your letter.
('65', 457, 6, 12, 814302) I do not read Hindustan Times.
('65', 457, 6, 13, 814333) The cutting you send me I see for the first time.
('65', 457, 6, 14, 814383) It is just now 3 a.m.
('65', 457, 6, 15, 814405) Devdas is here but I see him rarely.
('65', 457, 6, 16, 814442) I am sending the cutting to him with a note of disapprobation.
('65', 457, 6, 17, 814505) Although it was a Press agency report, he had no right to publish it without reference to me.
('65', 457, 6, 18, 814599) You or he or anybody would be justified in publishing exclusive news provided it was authorized by the party affected.
('65', 457, 6, 19, 814718) There are today in India English journalists who, though not well disposed towards me, observe the rule with reference to me, not for my sake but for their own journalistic reputation.
('65', 457, 6, 20, 814903) I know that you did not err wittingly, but you have erred, now I can say, both as a soldier and [as a] journalist.
('65', 457, 6, 21, 815018) 1 The injury started with the U. P. wire from Patna.
('65', 457, 6, 22, 815071) But I have done.
('65', 457, 6, 23, 815088) I draw the attention of those who, I believe, are amenable to influence from me.
('65', 457, 6, 24, 815169) You must forget all about it, but learn the lesson that it is better not to print anything about me in which public interest is involved, without reference to me.

('65', 458, 6, 9, 815794) DEAR SAHEBJI MAHARAJ 1, I have kept your previous letter of 6th September by me.
('65', 458, 6, 10, 815875) I read your “Cows Help Cows” only last week.
('65', 458, 6, 11, 815920) It is beautifully written.
('65', 458, 6, 12, 815947) But I want to complain as a humble representative of the cow.
('65', 458, 6, 13, 816009) Some experts tell me that mixtures such as you contemplate are not wholly successful.
('65', 458, 6, 14, 816095) What, I find, is needed are experiments that would serve the villagers in their own villages.
('65', 458, 6, 15, 816189) If we do not find anything in that direction the majority of cows have to die so that the minority in off places like Dayalbagh may live !
('65', 458, 6, 16, 816328) I shall want your help in the village industries work.

('65', 459, 1, 4, 817304) So long as the undertaking lasts, the more honourable course is to refer all doubtful matters to the authorities.

('65', 460, 2, 3, 818157) TALK WITH MARS CHESLEY
('65', 460, 3, 4, 818180) [On or before December 15, 1934] 1
('65', 460, 4, 5, 818215) MARY CHESLEY: Do you believe your guidance comes from subconscious reasoning or from God ?
('65', 460, 5, 6, 818306) GANDHI: From God—but subconscious reasoning may be the voice of God.
('65', 460, 5, 7, 818375) often, after seeing the way I consciously reason out why that is the best way.
('65', 460, 5, 8, 818454) Mahomet was like this, very sure his voices were of God and he was no impostor.
('65', 460, 6, 9, 818534) M. C. Then does following conscience lead to mystical experiences?
('65', 460, 7, 10, 818601) G. It may or it may not.
('65', 460, 7, 11, 818626) But one thing is sure that the humility which feels itself nothing before God is necessary for mystical experiences, such as those of Saint Francis and Saint Augustine.
('65', 460, 7, 12, 818795) on the other hand, a Bradlaw or a Marcus Aurelius, though following conscience, felt themselves to be self made men and not dependent on God, and so they could get no mystical experiences or joy.
('65', 460, 7, 13, 818991) To me, following conscience is following a living force, not an ethical code.
('65', 460, 8, 14, 819069) M. C. How do you understand what is God’s guidance for you when it is a question of choosing between two good things?
('65', 460, 9, 15, 819187) G. I use my intellect on the subject and if I don’t get any strong feeling as to which of the two I should choose, I just leave the matter, and before long I wake up one morning with the perfect assurance that it should be A rather than B. Always, of course, it is necessary to be utterly humble and go wherever the decision should take you, even though it should be to difficulties and suffering.
('65', 460, 10, 16, 819585) M. C. Is it not necessary to lead a disciplined life in order to receive these assurances as to what to do and not to do?
('65', 460, 11, 17, 819707) G. Yes, of course, one’s mind must be attuned to the five necessary rules of love, truth, purity, non possession and fearlessness.
('65', 460, 12, 18, 819838) M. C. Do you include bodily discipline such as fasting?
('65', 460, 13, 19, 819894) G. It you follow the five rules already mentioned.
('65', 460, 13, 20, 819945) you will find that bodily discipline follows automatically.
('65', 460, 13, 21, 820005) You should read Rajayokga by Swami Vivekananda on this point.
('65', 460, 14, 22, 820067) 1 According to the source the talk took place at the close of one of the sessions of the All India Village Industries Association held at Wardha on December 14 and 15, 1934.
('65', 461, 0, 1, 820241) 462 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 461, 1, 2, 820283) Just then word was brought to Gandhi that a certain rich man had donated a large sum of money to the All India Village Industries Association fund, and joy was expressed by the little group, Gandhi remarking quietly .
('65', 461, 1, 3, 820501) that loving service was receiving its reward.
('65', 461, 1, 4, 820547) He had been saying previously that we who believed in non violence should win the rich to serve the poor by our own devoted service and by showing our contentment and happiness in a position of less wealth and prestige than we might demand.
('65', 461, 1, 5, 820788) He spoke about this again now.
('65', 461, 2, 6, 820819) G. If rich people could see us poorer ones really content instead of hankering after wealth, it would become the fashion to dispense with wealth.
('65', 461, 2, 7, 820965) The fashion for brown bread grew because a few enthusiasts showed that they really believed in it and liked it.
('65', 461, 2, 8, 821077) Unfortunately the higher castes have failed to identify themselves with their humbler fellows.
('65', 461, 2, 9, 821172) This is the darkest hour of Hinduism.
('65', 461, 2, 10, 821210) I have no excuse to offer for it.
('65', 461, 3, 11, 821244) M. C. What is your remedy ?
('65', 461, 4, 12, 821272) G. Everything I am doing, village industries, khaddar, Harijan work, etc.
('65', 461, 5, 13, 821346) M. C. From what sources do you get your conception of God ?
('65', 461, 6, 14, 821406) G. From my childhood, remembering my mother’s constant visits to the temple.
('65', 461, 6, 15, 821483) Sometimes these were as many as four or five a day, and never less than two.
('65', 461, 6, 16, 821560) Also my nurse used to tell me I must repeat the name of God if I felt afraid.
('65', 461, 7, 17, 821638) M. C. Are not your own experiences sources of your conception too?
('65', 461, 8, 18, 821705) G. Yes, but they did not begin until later, in South Africa.
('65', 461, 8, 19, 821766) Before that I had a period of doubt and it was during that time that I began to study Islam and Christianity.
('65', 461, 9, 20, 821876) M. C. How far have these two religions coloured your conception of God ?
('65', 461, 10, 21, 821949) G. I began with a prejudice against Christianity because in my youth it had meant to me drink, eating meat and Western clothes.
('65', 461, 10, 22, 822077) I had no such prejudice to overcome against Islam.
('65', 461, 10, 23, 822128) Later when I met some fine Christian people my prejudice went, and for a year I studied Christian books voraciously, attended the Keswick Convention, met famous divines and generally absorbed Christianity, honestly seeking to know if I should do as some of my friends were always begging me to do— become a Christian.
('65', 461, 10, 24, 822446) But in the end I honestly felt I could not do so.
('65', 461, 10, 25, 822496) I believe in the historic Jesus, for the four gospels bear the stamp of the real experience of devotees.
('65', 461, 11, 26, 822601) M. C. Is the conception of God as Father only to be found in Chris tianity ?
('65', 461, 12, 27, 822678) 1 At this point Kasturba and others came with Gandhiji's food.
('65', 461, 12, 28, 822741) Mary Chesley left and joined him again during his evening walk.
('65', 462, 0, 1, 822805) VOL. 64 : 16 SEPTEMBER, 1934 15 DECEMBER, 1934 463
('65', 462, 1, 2, 822856) G. No, it is also to be found in Hinduism.
('65', 462, 1, 3, 822899) Read the second chapter of the Gita in which the conception of God, not only as Father, but also as Mother is to be found.
('65', 462, 1, 4, 823022) This is not the case with Islam, for among all its ninetynine names for God, .’Father” is not one.
('65', 462, 1, 5, 823121) Mahomet, like Christ, had the authoritative note of God consciousness.
('65', 462, 1, 6, 823192) If you judge a religion by the changed lives of its adherents, Islam seems to me to have as much to show as Christianity.
('65', 462, 1, 7, 823314) Anyway, two thousand years is a very brief time in which to judge the merits of a religion.
('65', 462, 2, 8, 823406) M. C. I know some people who are praying that you may become a Christian .
('65', 462, 3, 9, 823481) G. (Laughing) .
('65', 462, 3, 10, 823497) Many are—
('65', 462, 4, 11, 823507) M. C. But wait until you hear the reason—it is because they feel that you can give a truer interpretation of Christianity than any yet given to the world.
('65', 462, 5, 12, 823662) G. There are others who feel that too.
('65', 462, 5, 13, 823701) But if they wish me to say that Christianity is the only true religion, I cannot do so.
('65', 462, 5, 14, 823789) I can truly say, however, that Christianity is a true religion.
('65', 462, 6, 15, 823853) M. C. What do you think is the special contribution of Christianity, Islam and Hinduism to the world?
('65', 462, 7, 16, 823955) G. I think Christianity’s particular contribution is that of active love.
('65', 462, 7, 17, 824029) No other religion says so firmly that God is love, and the New Testament is full of the word.
('65', 462, 7, 18, 824123) Christians, however, as a whole have denied this principle with their wars.
('65', 462, 7, 19, 824199) The ahimsa of Hinduism is a more passive thing than the active Christian love.
('65', 462, 7, 20, 824278) The great contribution of Hinduism is its recognition of the unity of all life.
('65', 462, 7, 21, 824358) Like Christianity, Hinduism has not lived up to its teaching.
('65', 462, 7, 22, 824420) If either had done so, there would have been no need for Islam, for whatever is fundamentally good in a religion for the part of the world in which it has arisen is certainly good for the whole world.
('65', 462, 7, 23, 824621) Islam’s contribution has been the brotherhood of all men.
('65', 462, 7, 24, 824679) Later this idea was limited to the Islamic brotherhood, so Muslims too have failed to live up to the teaching of their religion.
('65', 462, 7, 25, 824808) Khan Saheb, with his teaching of the service of all humanity, is bringing them back to the original idea.
('65', 462, 8, 26, 824914) M. C. You once said that the idea of Jesus as the Son of God was a mystical conception.
('65', 462, 8, 27, 825002) Would you enlarge upon that, please?
('65', 462, 9, 28, 825039) C. I believe that Jesus was a man born in the natural way, and that people, seeing the wonderful things he did, ascribed divinity to him, and then described it mystically by saying that he was the Son of God.
('65', 462, 10, 29, 825248) M. C. Do you think such writers were impostors?
('65', 462, 11, 30, 825296) I hey were just expressing their conception mystically.
('65', 462, 11, 31, 825352) The whole Book of Revelation is a description of mystical experiences.
('65', 462, 11, 32, 825423) For example, it does not mean literally that streets were to be paved with gold.
('65', 462, 11, 33, 825504) Many mystical expressions would be gross if they meant literally what they said.
('65', 463, 0, 1, 825585) 464 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('65', 463, 1, 2, 825627) M. C. Have you had any mystical experiences?
('65', 463, 2, 3, 825672) G. If, by mystical experiences, you mean visions, no.
('65', 463, 2, 4, 825726) I should be a fraud if I claimed to have had such.
('65', 463, 2, 5, 825777) But I am very sure of the voice which guides me.
('65', 463, 2, 6, 825826) Of course, some unbalanced people have claimed to hear voices too—but I do not think anyone has suggested that I am unbalanced.
('65', 463, 3, 7, 825954) M. C. You have spoken of your sense of uneasiness which preceded your twenty one days’ fast 2 last year, and also said that generally when obeying your inner voice, you find a reason for your action afterwards.
('65', 463, 3, 8, 826165) Did you find a reason for the twenty one days’ fast?
('65', 463, 4, 9, 826218) G. It is true that a sense of uneasiness drove me to that fast.
('65', 463, 4, 10, 826282) Usually, even under the greatest strain I can remain quite buoyant but when I lost that buoyancy and could not even sleep, I decided to fast and immediately found peace.
('65', 463, 4, 11, 826452) Yes, I did discover a reason for it, one which the fast itself brought to light; for several people, both at the time and afterwards, wrote to tell me of sins which they had committed and which they had now put right to the best of their ability.
('65', 463, 4, 12, 826699) They said that the fast had brought them to a knowledge of the truth about themselves and that they would not allow such faults to occur again.
('65', 463, 5, 13, 826843) M. C. You have said sometimes that consciousness of sin brings a feeling of separation from God.
('65', 463, 5, 14, 826940) Did you feel any such separation before your fast?
('65', 463, 6, 15, 826991) I felt only great uneasiness and restlessness.
('65', 463, 6, 16, 827038) I could not joke even in my usual way.
('65', 463, 6, 17, 827077) During the discussion on the organization of Village Industries’ Association Gandhi made it clear that ‘rural mindedness’ was to him not a mere detail, but the prime necessity.
('65', 463, 6, 18, 827254) When the name of a certain woman was suggested as a member of the Board, he remembered that she had, in all seriousness, thought it impossible to use tooth sticks in a town, because there was nowhere to throw them.
('65', 463, 6, 19, 827469) We could not have anyone of such mentality on the Board.
('65', 463, 6, 20, 827526) To begin with, we do not want in our Village Industries to try to compete with the West in making tooth powders, etc.
('65', 463, 7, 21, 827644) Bapu, pp.
('65', 463, 8, 22, 827654) 1 This remark was said in such a droll way that all burst into laughter.
('65', 463, 8, 23, 827727) 2 From May 8 to 28, 1933.
