('36', 0, 1, 2, 42) 1. NOTES
('36', 0, 2, 3, 51) SERVANTS OF INDIA FIRE RELIEF
('36', 0, 3, 4, 81) Contributions made in answer to the appeal of the Rt.
('36', 0, 3, 5, 135) Srinivasa Sastri total nearly Rs. 50,000. It should be remembered that two lacs at least are wanted to enable the Society to make a fresh start in respect of the interrupted activities.
('36', 0, 3, 6, 321) The weekly organ, The Servant of India, is being brought out under difficulties.
('36', 0, 3, 7, 402) It is to be hoped that the whole amount will be subscribed without delay irrespective of one’s politics.
('36', 0, 4, 8, 507) LIMITED SACRIFICE
('36', 0, 5, 9, 525) An ex principal of a national college, a master of arts, writes:
('36', 0, 6, 10, 590) Your article on sacrifice 1 is nearly heart rending.
('36', 0, 6, 11, 643) You seem to be expecting more sacrifice from those who are willing and have already done their best, and do not seem to take to task those pretending followers who have the effrontery of exploiting the national movement for their personal benefit.
('36', 0, 6, 12, 891) It would be doing greater service to the motherland if you try to get hold of rich people who will swear by you to maintain six good workers each who will take up village organization.
('36', 0, 6, 13, 1076) I have singled out the foregoing sentences from a longish letter.
('36', 0, 6, 14, 1142) In the first instance, there can be no limit to one’s sacrifice.
('36', 0, 6, 15, 1207) A sacrifice that calculates and bargains is hardly a sacrifice.
('36', 0, 6, 16, 1271) I have asked for no more than what has been given in other parts of the world where people have regained or retained their freedom; nor are instances of such uttermost sacrifice lacking even in our country.
('36', 0, 6, 17, 1478) That sacrifice comes from deep conviction and it is deep conviction that is just now wanted in the country.
('36', 0, 6, 18, 1586) In the second instance, one does not ask or expect anything from pretended followers.
('36', 0, 6, 19, 1672) The prevalent law throughout the world seems to be for those who give to give more and more.
('36', 0, 6, 20, 1765) They do so, not under compulsion, but voluntarily and joyfully.
('36', 0, 6, 21, 1829) And, at the end of the giving, they regret that they have not more to give.
('36', 0, 6, 22, 1905) In the third place, I do not know a single honest, industrious and intelligent worker who is starving for want of work.
('36', 0, 6, 23, 2025) The difficulty occurs when the worker dictates terms or has requirements which, if he

('36', 1, 1, 2, 2182) declined to be bound by custom or sentiment, would have no existence whatsoever.
('36', 1, 1, 3, 2263) After all, it is the few patriotic rich men in the country who are financing several public movements.
('36', 1, 1, 4, 2366) My own experience is that money enough has always been found wherever a just cause has been discovered to be backed by honest and able workers.
('36', 1, 1, 5, 2510) Young workers are more and more devoting themselves daily to village work, but ten times as many workers are required.
('36', 1, 1, 6, 2629) There is no dearth of money or work.
('36', 1, 1, 7, 2666) But there is dearth of men who are satisfied with a modest salary in keeping with the conditions of the country.
('36', 1, 1, 8, 2779) To mention only those activities which come under my direct observation and general control, there are khadi work, untouchability, national education, dairy work, tannery, etc.
('36', 1, 2, 9, 2956) FROM THE FRYING PAN
('36', 1, 3, 10, 2976) The draft rules published by the Madras Government about spinning in primary schools show what can happen even under ‘responsible’ government when the government may afford to ignore public opinion.
('36', 1, 3, 11, 3175) What response can a government that is, say, dependent upon the votes of zamindars make to their voteless ryots?
('36', 1, 3, 12, 3288) When, therefore, there is only a caricature of responsible government, things can be much worse than under a frankly and purely autocratic government.
('36', 1, 3, 13, 3439) The latter, not depending upon the votes of any class, can afford to be impartial to all.
('36', 1, 3, 14, 3529) The former dare not.
('36', 1, 3, 15, 3550) The draft rules are naturally from the Education Minister who is considered to be responsible to the people, i.e., the select electorate.
('36', 1, 3, 16, 3688) But, having no knowledge evidently of rural conditions, he thinks that instruction in hand spinning in primary schools is unnecessary.
('36', 1, 3, 17, 3823) Instead, therefore, of frankly putting a ban upon it, he seeks to circu mvent it by ruling that “practical instruction should not be introduced in standards below the fourth without the previous approval of the Director of Public Instruction,” that it should “ordinarily have refe rence to the chief occupations or industries of the locality or the class of pupils,” and that “spinning by itself without provision for weaving should not form a subject for such institution”.
('36', 1, 3, 18, 4298) The last condition is enough to keep out spinning from the average primary school, if only because hardly a primary school can afford the expense of a weaving instructor and the floor space required for setting up a loom.
('36', 1, 3, 19, 4520) Indeed, even the spinning wheel has by experience been found to be too expensive and too large for the average school.
('36', 1, 3, 20, 4639) The All India Spinners’ Association is, therefore, advising all schoolmasters and
('36', 2, 0, 1, 4721) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 3
('36', 2, 1, 2, 4763) municipal councils to introduce the takli which is inexpensive, handy, requires no floor space to keep and does not easily go out of order.
('36', 2, 1, 3, 4903) It is surprising too that neither the Minister nor his advisers seem to realize that hand spinning cannot be and must not be put on a level with the other occupations.
('36', 2, 1, 4, 5071) As Sjt.
('36', 2, 1, 5, 5079) C. Rajagopalachari points out in his appeal to local bodies in the Madras Presidency, it is pre eminently a universal national occupation which, having all but died, needs to be revived and popularized.
('36', 2, 1, 6, 5282) It would be a useless waste of time and money to teach in primary schools living occupations which children can learn much better and much more quickly from their parents than from theoretical and indifferent teachers.
('36', 2, 1, 7, 5501) I am glad, therefore, that the Chittoor District Education Council has voted against the draft rules and hope that the other bodies will follow suit.

('36', 2, 3, 9, 5673) 2. ‘MORE ANIMAL THAN HUMAN’
('36', 2, 4, 10, 5701) A medical correspondent referring to the article ‘What is Natural?’ 1 in Young India of the 24th ultimo writes:
('36', 2, 5, 11, 5813) It is only in the mass that the people’s instinct of violence is aroused.
('36', 2, 5, 12, 5887) It is almost impossible to prevent the use of physical force under such circumstances and I wonder if it is altogether desirable to discourage it.
('36', 2, 5, 13, 6034) It is positively against man’s nature.
('36', 2, 5, 14, 6073) Man is animal first and human afterwards.
('36', 2, 5, 15, 6115) Just think of the ancestor of the Australian savage and his times when there was no art, no literature, no science, and when man was a hunter and communi cated with his fellows by means of gestures.
('36', 2, 5, 16, 6314) Our ethical code is a thin veneer and the passions of the brute are still lurking within us.
('36', 2, 5, 17, 6407) It is not natural to man to find and know God, much less to worship him.
('36', 2, 5, 18, 6480) In an individual naturally brought up, educated in an unbiassed and non theological atmosphere, the idea ofworshipping God will be quite unnatural.
('36', 2, 5, 19, 6628) Millions of educated adults in the world never enter a church, mosque or temple.
('36', 2, 5, 20, 6709) God worship is an acquired habit.
('36', 2, 5, 21, 6743) The question of virtue and vice has nothing to do with God.
('36', 2, 5, 22, 6803) Morality arises from the necessities of group life, and it has its sanctions in the social needs of man rather than in a capricious divine will.
('36', 2, 5, 23, 6948) Man is not made in the image of God; it is God who is made in the image of man.
('36', 2, 5, 24, 7028) Your moral code would not be debased if you regarded the ape as your remote cousin.
('36', 2, 5, 25, 7112) Eating, drinking, and sexual gratification are absolutely natural to man.
('36', 2, 5, 26, 7186) There are
('36', 2, 6, 27, 7196) 1 Vide “What is Natural?”, 13 6 1926.
('36', 3, 0, 1, 7234) 4 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 3, 1, 2, 7274) limits of course, but they are perfectly physiological and partly conventional.
('36', 3, 1, 3, 7354) How can you preach this doctrine of complete renunciation of sexual desire?
('36', 3, 1, 4, 7430) Don’t you think that we cannot possibly attain complete renunciation of the desire except through an exhaustive fulfilment of it?
('36', 3, 1, 5, 7560) You say, ‘Man’s nature is not himsa but ahimsa.’ But even your own programme of the boycott of the
('36', 3, 2, 6, 7659) British goods, if it had been successful, could have resulted in nothing but violence to the British workers.
('36', 3, 2, 7, 7769) Starving a man is as much violence as hitting him with a lathi.
('36', 3, 2, 8, 7833) Your soul force or love force is a figment of imagination.
('36', 3, 2, 9, 7892) Ahimsa is the creed of civilization, but is not man’s nature.
('36', 3, 2, 10, 7954) I have very much condensed the medical practitioner’s letter.
('36', 3, 2, 11, 8016) The confidence with which it is written takes one’s breath away.
('36', 3, 2, 12, 8081) And yet the correspondent, who appears to be a practitioner of long standing and who has an English degree, represents a large number of educated men.
('36', 3, 2, 13, 8232) I must confess, however, that he does not convince me.
('36', 3, 2, 14, 8287) Let us examine his arguments.
('36', 3, 2, 15, 8317) He says that non violence cannot be attained by the mass of people.
('36', 3, 2, 16, 8385) And, yet, we find that the general work of mankind is being carried on from day to day by the mass of people acting in harmony as if by instinct.
('36', 3, 2, 17, 8531) If they were instinctively violent, the world would end in no time.
('36', 3, 2, 18, 8599) They remain peaceful naturally and without any police or other compulsion.
('36', 3, 2, 19, 8674) It is when the mass mind is unnaturally influenced by wicked men that the mass of mankind commit violence.
('36', 3, 2, 20, 8781) But they forget it as quickly as they commit it, because they return to their peaceful nature immediately the evil influence of the directing mind is removed.
('36', 3, 3, 21, 8940) Hitherto, one has been taught to believe that a species is recognized and differentiated from the rest by its special characteristics.
('36', 3, 3, 22, 9075) Therefore, it would be wrong, I presume, to say that a horse is animal first and horse after.
('36', 3, 3, 23, 9169) He shares something in common with the other animals, but he dare not shed his horseliness and yet remain an animal.
('36', 3, 3, 24, 9286) Having lost his special virtue, he loses also his general status.
('36', 3, 3, 25, 9352) Similarly, if a man lost his status as man and began to grow a tail and walk on all fours, lost the use of his hands, and, more than that, lost the use of his reason, would he not lose with the loss of his status as man his status also as animal?
('36', 3, 3, 26, 9599) Neither the ox nor the ass, neither the sheep nor the goat will claim his as theirs.
('36', 3, 3, 27, 9684) I would suggest to the medical friend that man can be classed as animal only so long as he retains his humanity.
('36', 3, 4, 28, 9797) Neither is there any force in referring me to the Australian savage.
('36', 3, 4, 29, 9866) Even that Australian savage was fundamentally different from
('36', 4, 0, 1, 9927) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 5
('36', 4, 1, 2, 9969) the brute, because the brute always will remain brute, whereas the savage has in him the capacity for developing to the fullest height attainable by man.
('36', 4, 1, 3, 10123) We need not go to the Australian savage.
('36', 4, 1, 4, 10164) Our Indian ancestors also were at one time, it will hardly be disputed, just as good and noble savages as the Australians.
('36', 4, 1, 5, 10287) I entirely endorse the remark of the correspondent that even in our so called civilized state, we are not far removed from savages.
('36', 4, 1, 6, 10419) But he is willing to allow that at least we, the civilized descendants of our savage ancestors, may be differentiated from the brute creation.
('36', 4, 1, 7, 10562) It is natural for the brute to be brutal.
('36', 4, 1, 8, 10604) We would resent the adjective if it was applied to us.
('36', 4, 2, 9, 10659) The corespondent apologizes for suggesting that I might regard myself as a ‘remote cousin of the ape’.
('36', 4, 2, 10, 10762) The truth is that my ethics not only permit me to claim but require me to own kinship with not merely the ape but the horse and the sheep, the lion and the leopard, the snake and the scorpion.
('36', 4, 2, 11, 10955) Not so need these kinsfolk regard themselves.
('36', 4, 2, 12, 11001) The hard ethics which rule my life, and I hold ought to rule that of every man and woman, impose this unilateral obligation upon us.
('36', 4, 2, 13, 11134) And it is so imposed because man alone is made in the image of God.
('36', 4, 2, 14, 11202) That some of us do not recognize that status of ours makes no difference, except that then we do not get the benefit of the status, even as a lion brought up in the company of sheep, may not know his own status and, therefore, does not receive its benefits; but it belongs to him, nevertheless, and the moment he realizes it, he begins to exercise his dominion over the sheep.
('36', 4, 2, 15, 11579) But no sheep masquerading as a lion can ever attain the leonine status.
('36', 4, 2, 16, 11651) And to prove the proposition that man is made in the image of God, it is surely unnecessary to show that all men admittedly exhibit that image in their own persons.
('36', 4, 2, 17, 11816) It is enough to show that one man at least has done so.
('36', 4, 2, 18, 11872) And, will it be denied that the great religious teachers of mankind have exhibited the image of God in their own persons?
('36', 4, 3, 19, 11994) But, of course, my correspondent even contends that it is not natural to man to find and know God and; therefore, he says ‘man makes God in his own image’.
('36', 4, 3, 20, 12150) All I can say is that the whole of the evidence hitherto produced by travellers controvert this astounding proposition.
('36', 4, 3, 21, 12270) It is being more and more demonstrated that it is the worship of God, be it in the crudest manner possible, which distin guishes man from the brute.
('36', 4, 3, 22, 12419) It is the possession of that additional quality which gives him such enormous hold upon God’s creation.
('36', 4, 3, 23, 12523) It is wholly irrelevant to show that millions of educated people never
('36', 5, 0, 1, 12594) 6 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 5, 1, 2, 12634) enter a church, mosque or temple.
('36', 5, 1, 3, 12668) Such entry is neither natural nor indispensable for the worship of God.
('36', 5, 1, 4, 12740) Those even who bow their heads before stocks and stones, who believe in incantations or ghosts, acknowledge a power above and beyond them.
('36', 5, 1, 5, 12879) It is true that this form of worship is savage, very crude; nevertheless, it is worship of God.
('36', 5, 1, 6, 12975) Gold is still gold though in its crudest state.
('36', 5, 1, 7, 13023) It merely awaits refine ment to be treated as gold even by the ignorant.
('36', 5, 1, 8, 13096) No amount of refinement will turn iron ore into gold.
('36', 5, 1, 9, 13150) Refined worship is doubtless due to the effort of man.
('36', 5, 1, 10, 13205) Crude worship is as old as Adam, and, as natural to him as eating and drinking, if not more natural.
('36', 5, 1, 11, 13306) A man may live without eating for days on end, he does not live without worship for a single minute.
('36', 5, 1, 12, 13407) He may not acknowledge the fact as many an ignorant man may not acknowledge the possession of lungs or the fact of the circulation of blood.
('36', 5, 2, 13, 13548) The correspondent puts sexual gratification on a level with eating and drinking.
('36', 5, 2, 14, 13629) If he had read my article carefully he would have avoided the confusion of thought that one traces in the thing quoted by him.
('36', 5, 2, 15, 13756) What I have said and repeat is that eating for pleasure, for the gratification, of the palate, is not natural to men.
('36', 5, 2, 16, 13874) But eating to live is natural.
('36', 5, 2, 17, 13905) And so is the sexual act, but not gratification, for the sake of perpetuation of the species, natural to man.
('36', 5, 3, 18, 14015) I fear I shall preach to the end of my days complete renunci ation of sexual desire.
('36', 5, 3, 19, 14100) And this correspondent is the first medical man to tell me that such renunciation is not possible except through ‘our exhaustive fulfilment of the sexual desire’.
('36', 5, 3, 20, 14263) On the contrary, medical authorities tell me that ‘an exhaustive fulfilment leads not to renunci ation, but to ruinous imbecility.
('36', 5, 3, 21, 14394) Complete renunciation of the desire no doubt requires an effort, but is it not worth the prize?
('36', 5, 3, 22, 14490) If a lifetime may be devoted to the exploration of the properties of sound or light and heat, which after all only show us the phenomenal world to advantage, is it too much to expect an equal effort to attain complete renunciation which leads to self realization, or, in other words, to a certain knowledge of God?
('36', 5, 4, 23, 14805) And one who is fairly on the road to renunciation will not need to be told that ahimsa (love), not himsa (hate), rules man, I was almost about to say, the world.
('36', 5, 4, 24, 14967) Illustrations that the correspondent gives to prove my own himsa betrays his ignorance of my writings.
('36', 5, 4, 25, 15070) The ignorance, of course, does not matter, because., no one need read Young India.
('36', 5, 4, 26, 15153) But ignorance of a man’s views is unpardonable when
('36', 6, 0, 1, 15205) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 7
('36', 6, 1, 2, 15247) one ventures to criticize them.
('36', 6, 1, 3, 15279) I have advocated boycott only foreign cloth and there is no violence done to the British workers who may be thrown out of employment because of the boycott of cloth manufa ctured by them, for the simple reason that purchase of foreign cloth is not an obligation undertaken by India.
('36', 6, 1, 4, 15562) Violence is all the other way.
('36', 6, 1, 5, 15593) It is done to India in the name and on behalf of British workers by imposing British cloth upon India.
('36', 6, 1, 6, 15696) A drunkard does no violence to the owner of a drink shop when he becomes a teetotaller.
('36', 6, 1, 7, 15784) He serves both the publican and himself.
('36', 6, 1, 8, 15825) And so will India serve both the foreigners and herself, when she ceases to buy foreign cloth.
('36', 6, 1, 9, 15920) Foreign workmen will not starve, but will find better employment.
('36', 6, 1, 10, 15986) And if they will voluntarily give up manufacturing cloth for India, they will have taken part in a great humanitarian movement.

('36', 6, 3, 12, 16136) 3. ‘TOWARDS MORAL BANKRUPTCY’ II
('36', 6, 4, 13, 16169) “In the wake of abortion,” says M. Bureau, “come infanticide, incest, and crimes that outrage nature.
('36', 6, 4, 14, 16271) There is nothing special to say about the first, except that the crime has become more frequent in spite of all the facilities offered to unmarried mothers and of the extension of anti conceptionist practices and abortion.
('36', 6, 4, 15, 16494) It no longer arouses the same reprobation among so called ‘respectable’ people and juries usually return a verdict of ‘not guilty’.” M. Bureau devotes a full section to the growth of pornographic literature.
('36', 6, 4, 16, 16702) He defines it as the exploitation, with an erotic or obscene intention, of the resources which literature, the drama, and place pictures at men’s disposal for their mental refreshment and repose.
('36', 6, 4, 17, 16898) And he adds:
('36', 6, 5, 18, 16911) In every branch of its business it has secured markets, the extent of which may be gauged by the ingenuity and excellent commercial organization of the directors, the enormous amount of capital, the unexampled perfection of the methods employed .
('36', 6, 5, 19, 17158) The impression has been so strong and so unique that the whole psychological life of the individual is affected by it, a sort of secondary sexual life, which exists wholly in the imagination, is created.
('36', 6, 5, 20, 17362) M. Bureau then quotes this pathetic paragraph from M. Ruvsen:
('36', 6, 6, 21, 17424) All pornographic and sadistic literature secures in this psychological law the most powerful enticement which it exerts over an innumerable number of readers, and the flourishing circulation of this literature shows beyond dispute that those who live a secondary sexual life through their imagination
('36', 7, 0, 1, 17725) 8 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 7, 1, 2, 17765) are legion, not to mention those in lunatic asylums —especially in a period like our own, when the abuse of newspapers and books creates around all consciences what W. James calls ‘a plurality of under universe’, in which each can lose himself, and forget along with himself the duties of the present hour.
('36', 7, 1, 3, 18072) These disastrous consequences, it should never be forgotten, are a direct result of one single fundamental error, namely, that sexual indulgence for its own sake is a human necessity and that without it neither man nor woman reaches their full growth.
('36', 7, 1, 4, 18324) Immediately a person becomes possessed of such an idea and begins to look upon what in his estimation was one time a vice as a virtue, there is no end to the multiplication of devices that would excite animal passions and help him to indulge in them.
('36', 7, 1, 5, 18575) M. Bureau then gives chapter and verse to show how the daily press, the magazine, the pamphlet, the novel, the photograph and the theatre increasingly pander to and provide for this debasing taste.
('36', 7, 1, 6, 18773) But the reference hitherto has been to the decay of morals amongst unmarried people.
('36', 7, 1, 7, 18858) M. Bureau next proceeds to show the measure of moral indiscipline in the married state.
('36', 7, 1, 8, 18946) He says:
('36', 7, 2, 9, 18955) Among the aristocracy, the middle class, and the peasants vanity and avarice are responsible for a vast number of marriages.
('36', 7, 2, 10, 19080) marriage is entered upon also to obtain an advantageous post to join two properties, especially two landed estates, to regularize a former connection or to legitimatize a natural child; to provide unfailing and devoted attentions for a man’s rheumatics and old age, to be able to choose the place of his garrison at the time of conscription, also to put an end to a life of vice, of which they are beginning to weary and to substitute another form of sexual life.
('36', 7, 2, 11, 19544) M. Bureau then cites facts and figures to show that these marriages, instead of reducing licentiousness actually promote it.
('36', 7, 2, 12, 19669) This degradation has been immensely helped by the so called scientificor mechanical inventions designed to restrict the effect of the sexual act without interfering with the act itself.
('36', 7, 2, 13, 19855) I must pass by the painful paragraphs regarding the increase in adultery and startling figures regarding judicial separations and divorces which, during the last twenty years, have more than doubled themselves.
('36', 7, 2, 14, 20066) I can also make only a passing reference to the extension of unrestricted freedom for indulgence to the female sex on the principle of ‘the same moral standard for the two sexes’.
('36', 7, 2, 15, 20246) The perfection of the anti conceptional practices and the methods of bringing about abortion have led to the emancipation of either sex from all moral restraint.
('36', 7, 2, 16, 20408) No wonder marriage itself is laughed at.
('36', 7, 2, 17, 20449) Here is a passage M. Bureau quotes from a popular author: Marriage is always according to my judgment one of the most barbarous institutions ever imagined.
('36', 7, 2, 18, 20605) I have no doubt that it will be abolished

('36', 8, 1, 2, 20689) if the human race makes any progress towards justice and reason.
('36', 8, 1, 3, 20754) But men are too gross and women too cowardly to demand a nobler law than that which rules them.
('36', 8, 1, 4, 20850) The results of the practices referred to by M. Bureau and of the theories by which the practices are justified are minutely examined.
('36', 8, 1, 5, 20984) He explains: We are, then, being carried away by the movement of moral indiscipline towards new destinies.
('36', 8, 1, 6, 21091) What are they?
('36', 8, 1, 7, 21106) Is the future that opens before us one of progress and light, of beauty and growing spirituality, or of retrogression and darkness, of deformity and animalism that is ever demanding more?
('36', 8, 1, 8, 21294) Is the indiscipline which has been established one of those fruitful revolts against antiquated rules, one of those beneficent rebellions which posterity remembers with gratitude because they were, at certain epochs, the necessary preliminary to its progress and the rise, or is it not rather the old Adam which rises up within us against the rules whose cry strictness is indispensable if we are to withstand the thrust of its bestial appeal?
('36', 8, 1, 9, 21738) Are we face to face with an evil revolt against the discipline of safety and life?
('36', 8, 1, 10, 21821) Then M. Bureau cites overwhelming testimony to show that hitherto the results have been disastrous in every respect.
('36', 8, 1, 11, 21938) They threaten life itself.

('36', 8, 5, 16, 22084) 1 I understand all you say, appreciate it too, but, you cannot realize my helplessness.
('36', 8, 5, 17, 22172) Just for the present moment, I am not despondent.
('36', 8, 5, 18, 22222) I feel certain that things will be better, but, at the present moment, the fury, I fear, must be allowed to spend itself.
('36', 8, 5, 19, 22344) Anyway, the remedies that I have for the disease are useless for the time being.
('36', 8, 5, 20, 22425) I know that evil doers are having full scope and that the poison is saturating even young minds.
('36', 8, 5, 21, 22522) It all seems inevitable.
('36', 8, 5, 22, 22547) Of course, do not think that because I do not write or speak, I am doing nothing.
('36', 8, 6, 23, 22629) 1 In this Lele had described how a few Hindus abused some Muslim boys for teasing a bull.
('36', 8, 6, 24, 22719) He believed that Hindus had no right to demand the stoppage of cow slaughter and that their agitation had to be ckecked.

('36', 9, 9, 16, 23530) MY DEAR KRISHNADAS, Your letter makes me sad.
('36', 9, 9, 17, 23576) I do hope that these troubles that face you just now will soon be over, that Guruji will soon be himself again and that your father will regain his strength.
('36', 9, 9, 18, 23734) But I quite recognize that you must be for the time being by the side of those who are ailing.
('36', 9, 9, 19, 23829) I want you not to go into the question of the propriety of asking for financial assistance.
('36', 9, 9, 20, 23921) After all I am disbursing trust funds.
('36', 9, 9, 21, 23960) And, I have not made them without careful thought.

('36', 10, 1, 3, 24408) You must not therefore hesitate to tell me what you need.
('36', 10, 1, 4, 24466) Guruji will, I know, support me in this thing.
('36', 10, 1, 5, 24513) I would certainly suggest his going to Calcutta if Calcutta climate suits him better.
('36', 10, 1, 6, 24599) After all he can find his peace even in Calcutta if he must be there for the sake of his health.
('36', 10, 1, 7, 24696) It would be otherwise, perhaps, if he was not a Calcutta man and had not passed years there.
('36', 10, 1, 8, 24789) But, he knows best where he should be.
('36', 10, 1, 9, 24828) There is no place I know yet where only dead cattle hide shoes can be guaranteed.
('36', 10, 1, 10, 24910) Ours will be the first workshop of the kind when it is opened.

('36', 10, 1, 13, 25122) She is very simple and good hearted.
('36', 10, 1, 14, 25159) She makes friends with everybody.

('36', 10, 6, 24, 25537) I wanted you to shake off your burden of administration for a few days.
('36', 10, 6, 25, 25609) If that happens, I believe your health will improve speedily.
('36', 10, 6, 26, 25671) Now we can say there has been some rain here.
('36', 10, 6, 27, 25717) The sky continues overcast.
('36', 10, 6, 28, 25745) Hence as you have stirred out already, I see no difficulty in your coming over here.
('36', 10, 6, 29, 25830) Moreover, there can be no great difference between the climate of Dhrangadhra and that of Ahmedabad.
('36', 10, 6, 30, 25931) Therefore, do come if you can.
('36', 10, 6, 31, 25962) I shall then be able to know something at any rate about your health.
('36', 10, 6, 32, 26032) And if you permit me to do some simple experiments, we may try such changes of diet as would suit you.

('36', 11, 4, 10, 26738) They should join the stores run by the Charkha sangh or some other public organization.

('36', 11, 7, 17, 27217) Two things are essential for health—regular sleep and only such food and as much of it as you can digest.
('36', 11, 7, 18, 27323) There ought to be regular evacuation.
('36', 11, 7, 19, 27361) I learn that without this the Italian pill is ineffective.
('36', 11, 7, 20, 27420) For if the bowel movement is regular what does it matter if one takes the pill or not?
('36', 11, 7, 21, 27507) But it is good to take it.
('36', 11, 7, 22, 27534) There should be as much physical exercise as the body can stand.

('36', 12, 3, 4, 27816) JAMNADAS, I have your short and succinct but frightening letter.
('36', 12, 3, 5, 27881) But I have already made it clear to you that I would not care for such a letter.
('36', 12, 3, 6, 27962) You know that I was getting ready to relieve you at the time you sent me your last ultimatum.
('36', 12, 3, 7, 28056) Now I do not at all propose to do so.
('36', 12, 3, 8, 28094) One who takes up a responsibility should sacrifice even his life for it.
('36', 12, 3, 9, 28167) That is the way for individuals and even nations to rise.
('36', 12, 3, 10, 28225) Pampering spoils them both.
('36', 12, 3, 11, 28253) On what considerations have you just engaged that new man Jethalal?
('36', 12, 3, 12, 28321) How many of your resolves should I remind you of?
('36', 12, 3, 13, 28371) How long should I treat you as a child?
('36', 12, 3, 14, 28411) I want no more letters like the one I am replying to.
('36', 12, 3, 15, 28465) You must stick where you are until I myself transfer you.
('36', 12, 3, 16, 28523) We cannot have in this world all that we wish for.
('36', 12, 3, 17, 28574) But we must put up with the circumstances in which we find ourselves.
('36', 12, 3, 18, 28644) In a way, none of us deserves his position but from another point of view, it can be said that those who devote themselves to their jobs come to deserve their positions.
('36', 12, 3, 19, 28814) Only they are worthless who though knowing their duty do not wish to fulfil it and deliberately spoil the work allotted to them.
('36', 12, 3, 20, 28943) Surely you are not one of them.
('36', 12, 3, 21, 28975) Then what is the sense in constantly pointing your pistol at me?
('36', 12, 3, 22, 29040) Therefore there is only one order for you: stay put where you are, suffer any amount of privation and stick to your duty.

('36', 13, 1, 4, 29630) Their descriptions therefore differed from one another.

('36', 13, 8, 18, 30562) So it seems to us that unless you want an untruthful person for an example, you must either accept Him for what He claimed to be or throw Him out entirely as an untruthful impostor.” They stated that they were praying daily asking God to reveal Jesue Christ, the Saviour Of the World, to him until they read in the papers or heard from him that he had found “Him who is life eternal” (S.N. 10743).

('36', 16, 1, 5, 34536) The Macmillan Company, I imagine, will publish after the autobiography is complete or do they want [to] publish in parts?
('36', 16, 1, 6, 34658) 3. They do not want to control the translation rights?

('36', 16, 7, 15, 34986) MATHURADAS, I have your letter.
('36', 16, 7, 16, 35018) I am very happy that your temperature is now under control.
('36', 16, 7, 17, 35078) I hope you have made it a rule to keep to your bed when it is raining.
('36', 16, 7, 18, 35149) Even a slight pain in the stomach is not good.
('36', 16, 7, 19, 35196) Have you not come across a good doctor there?
('36', 16, 7, 20, 35242) If not, send all details to Dr. Mehta and have him prescribe treatment.
('36', 16, 7, 21, 35314) What is the situation about fruit there?
('36', 16, 7, 22, 35355) Do you get good milk?
('36', 16, 7, 23, 35377) Persuade Taramati to write to me.
('36', 16, 7, 24, 35411) She should go for a walk even when it is raining a little.
('36', 16, 7, 25, 35470) She can carry an umbrella.
('36', 16, 7, 26, 35497) I shall consider it sinful if she does not gain in physical strength in that climate.

('36', 17, 2, 3, 35869) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, Friday, July 9, 1926
('36', 17, 3, 4, 35913) PYARELAL, I always intend to write to you but fail to do so.
('36', 17, 3, 5, 35974) Of course, you would never assume that my not writing is due to indifference.
('36', 17, 3, 6, 36052) Mathuradas gives you an excellent certificate.
('36', 17, 3, 7, 36099) But the real certificate must come from me.
('36', 17, 3, 8, 36143) And you will get my certificate only when Mathuradas grows as strong as a horse and your health improves so that when you return here I have no worry on your account.
('36', 17, 3, 9, 36310) Just as you had undertaken to translate from Gujarati into English, now you should do so from English and Gujarati into Hindi and send it to me; for the present, only for me to see it.
('36', 17, 3, 10, 36495) How much do you walk about there?
('36', 17, 3, 11, 36529) Compare the markets at Deolali and Panchgani.
('36', 17, 3, 12, 36575) Likewise, compare the people of Panchgani and Deolali.
('36', 17, 3, 13, 36630) There are four or five high schools in Panchgani.
('36', 17, 3, 14, 36680) Visit all of them and learn something from them.
('36', 17, 3, 15, 36729) Also study the present circumstances of the Gujarati high school recently started there.
('36', 17, 3, 16, 36818) You must be getting news of the people coming here.
('36', 17, 3, 17, 36870) The German lady is very courteous and goodnatured.
('36', 17, 3, 18, 36921) Krishnadas is happy at present.
('36', 17, 3, 19, 36953) Satis Babu and his father are quite ill.
('36', 17, 3, 20, 36994) They remain moody and hence we have to consider whether they should stay where they are, i.e., in Chandpur, or go to Darbhanga.
('36', 17, 3, 21, 37122) Write to Krishnadas.
('36', 17, 3, 22, 37143) His address is: C/o S. C. Guha, Darbhanga.
('36', 17, 3, 23, 37186) I have received an essay from you which I have not yet been able to go through.

('36', 17, 7, 27, 37389) BHAI KANTILAL, Your three letters to hand.
('36', 17, 7, 28, 37432) From the last one I see you have had heavy rains there.
('36', 17, 7, 29, 37488) The first showers here were quite heavy and we had
('36', 18, 0, 1, 37539) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 19
('36', 18, 1, 2, 37582) even two floods.
('36', 18, 1, 3, 37599) About your conflicting loyalties I would say that you should endure the pain that your mother is experiencing, regarding it as unavoidable.
('36', 18, 1, 4, 37739) It is my experience that in the face of their parents’ opposition to any good venture if the children remain as firm as they are humble, their parents give up their opposition.
('36', 18, 1, 5, 37916) Their opposition as well as their unhappiness increases only when the children waver and the parents hope they will succumb to parental love.
('36', 18, 1, 6, 38058) Hence if you have not the least doubt about your step and if you are equally confident about your capacity, you should tell your mother of your decision and shake off all anxiety.
('36', 18, 1, 7, 38238) Ask me anything further if you have to.
('36', 18, 1, 8, 38278) Personally, I do not at all believe khadi will benefit by the publication of its statistics, etc.
('36', 18, 1, 9, 38376) Nor do I believe that the economy effected at Gariadhar can be practised everywhere.
('36', 18, 1, 10, 38461) But the work at Gariadhar certainly deserves notice.
('36', 18, 1, 11, 38514) I noticed two specialities at Gariadhar.
('36', 18, 1, 12, 38555) One, that all who spin, weave and card are under Shambhu shanker’s personal supervision.
('36', 18, 1, 13, 38644) Two, that he himself knows these artisans and those who work along with them and has won their love.
('36', 18, 1, 14, 38745) He is able to get much of his work done directly.
('36', 18, 1, 15, 38795) Not everyone can accomplish all this.
('36', 18, 1, 16, 38833) Others should learn as much from this as they can.
('36', 18, 1, 17, 38884) It is enough if no cause is provided for the criticism of the Amreli centre.
('36', 18, 1, 18, 38961) I believe it is easy to meet criticism actuated either by ignor ance or prejudice.
('36', 18, 1, 19, 39044) I know it well and I quite appreciate that the present sale of khadi is due to Abbas Saheb’s presence.
('36', 18, 1, 20, 39147) Once people begin to buy khadi as a matter of duty, it will not take time to spread.
('36', 18, 1, 21, 39232) It is enough for the present if we diligently and by every possible effort increase the production of khadi and also improve its quality.
('36', 18, 1, 22, 39370) A sense of duty can be born only out of this.

('36', 19, 1, 9, 40103) You should obtain the consent of Shankerlal and Kaka before finally making any agreement, because I have not gone into all details and there is every possibility of my committing an error.

('36', 19, 12, 22, 40710) 1 According to a Free Press report, published in the Bombay Chronicle, this message was sent to Nayak, a Bengali paper, for its Deshbandhu Number which was published on July 11, 1926. 2 Of July 5 (S.N. 11128).
('36', 19, 12, 23, 40920) In it the addressee had explained that, on the basis of the earlier grant of Rs. 5,000, he had hoped to receive an equal amount again and incurred expenditure which he was finding it difficult to meet.
('36', 19, 12, 24, 41122) He proposed now to ask for only Rs. 2,500 and would raise the rest himself.
('36', 19, 12, 25, 41198) He offered to send a letter of assurance not to collect more funds for capital expenditure from his trustees (S.N. 11128 M).

('36', 20, 6, 10, 41638) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter about the proposed China visit.
('36', 20, 6, 11, 41702) 2 So far as it is humanly possible, I shall certainly visit China next year if I am really wanted there, that is, if a satisfactory invitation comes.
('36', 20, 6, 12, 41852) But, with my varied activities, one can never say with certainty of things that are to happen twelve months hence.
('36', 20, 6, 13, 41967) That is the only reason for my cautious reply.
('36', 20, 6, 14, 42014) Circumstances beyond my control may make it impossible to leave India.

('36', 20, 7, 17, 42273) 2 On February 24, 1926 A. A. Paul had written to Gandhiji inviting him on behalf of the Student Christian Association of India, Burma and Ceylon, to visit China (S.N. 11362).
('36', 20, 7, 18, 42448) On March 3 Gandhiji replied (S.N. 11363).
('36', 20, 7, 19, 42490) To a further letter from Paul on March 9 (S.N. 11364) Gandhiji replied on March 15 (S.N. 11365).
('36', 20, 7, 20, 42587) Paul had acknowledged Gandhiji’s letter on March 26 (S.N. 11366).
('36', 20, 7, 21, 42653) On May 4 he had forwarded to Gandhi copies of two letters which T. Z. Koo, a Chinese intellectual had written to Paul explaining the aim, scope etc.” of Gandhiji”s proposed visit to China (S.N. 11367 9).
('36', 20, 7, 22, 42857) On May 9, Gandhiji wrote to Paul tentatively accepting the invitation (S.N. 11370).
('36', 20, 7, 23, 42941) On May 30 he replied to Paul’s further letter of May 24 (S.N. 11371) conveying more Chinese suggestions regarding the visit (S.N. 11372).
('36', 20, 7, 24, 43079) Paul wrote again on July 6 (S.N. 11374), forwarding the copy of a letter from Koo dated June 4 (S.N. 11373) and observing: “I wish it were possible for you to give them a more certain answer about the possibility of your visit in 1927” (S.N. 11374).
('36', 20, 7, 25, 43329) 3 This was in connection with a World Conference of Young Men’s Christian Associations at Helsingfors, which Gandhiji had finally declined to attend.

('36', 21, 1, 4, 43601) I must return in time for the Congress.
('36', 21, 1, 5, 43641) I would therefore advise our Chinese friends to take the little risk of my inability to go next year and not think of this year.

('36', 21, 6, 12, 43951) DEAR MR. JAYAKAR, Mr. Bharucha was here a few days ago and we talked about you.
('36', 21, 6, 13, 44031) To my surprise, he told me that you somehow or other had felt that you did not count with me and that I was always cool towards you.
('36', 21, 6, 14, 44164) He gave me his permission to mention this matter to you.
('36', 21, 6, 15, 44221) I cannot recall a single instance when I have either been cool or unmindful of you or your work.
('36', 21, 6, 16, 44318) On the contrary, ever since I had the pleasure of knowing you, I have valued your great ability, integrity, your patriotism and your gentlemanliness.
('36', 21, 6, 17, 44468) Our differences of opinion have made not the slightest difference in the estimation in which I have held you.
('36', 21, 6, 18, 44578) Please, therefore, disabuse your mind of any such feeling that Mr. Bharucha reports you to have expressed to him.
('36', 21, 6, 19, 44692) I wanted to write this letter immediately after Mr. Bharucha left, but my numerous preoccu pations have prevented me from doing so.
('36', 21, 6, 20, 44824) I hope that you are keeping well.

('36', 22, 7, 10, 45334) 25. HOW SHOULD SPINNING BE DONE?
('36', 22, 8, 11, 45367) A gentleman has sent yarn which is untidy, badly spun, badly rolled.
('36', 22, 8, 12, 45436) He has not measured its length and he writes:
('36', 22, 9, 13, 45482) As you want many voluntary spinners for the Spinners’ Association, I too wish to spin.
('36', 22, 9, 14, 45569) Kindly let me know the length of the yarn I am sending; if it is too little, I will make up the deficiency.
('36', 22, 9, 15, 45677) Slivers are not easy to get here; could you send me some?
('36', 22, 9, 16, 45735) Suppose we did not make our own chapatis in the country but ate delicate, beautifully shaped and coloured, artistically made chapatis imported from Japan.
('36', 22, 9, 17, 45890) Suppose, further, that someone with a little foresight saw in this practice the ruin of the country and, since we had forgotten how to prepare and bake chapatis, he suggested a chapati yajna and appealed to all to send their contribution towards it.
('36', 22, 9, 18, 46140) If, now, some patriot, bursting with enthusiasm, obtained a roll of dough from someone and sent me triangular, half done, half burnt chapatis soiled in transit, together with a note which read: “In response to your appeal for chapati yajna I, too, have decided to contribute to it.
('36', 22, 9, 19, 46422) I am sending a few today; please count them and let me know if they are too few, so that I may send more.
('36', 22, 9, 20, 46528) Rolls of dough are not easy to get here, could you send me some?” If anyone wishing to join the chapati yajna wrote to me to this effect, those who knew anything about making chapatis would all laugh at him and say that the gentleman no doubt loved India but did not know how to show his love in action.
('36', 22, 9, 21, 46832) Everyone, I am sure, can see the point of what it say about chapati yajna, but all will not immediately see that the gentleman who sent his contribution towards the spinning yajna has acted exactly as our imaginary volunteer for chapati yajna.
('36', 22, 9, 22, 47076) This is a sign of want of thought resulting from a mental habit of long standing.
('36', 22, 9, 23, 47158) We have forgotten all about the spinning wheel, so that,
('36', 23, 0, 1, 47215) 24 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 23, 1, 2, 47256) while we all see that, if we forget the art of making chapatis, we would starve, we do not see as readily that we are starving today because we have given up the spinning wheel.
('36', 23, 1, 3, 47434) That is the truth.
('36', 23, 1, 4, 47453) Spinning does not mean drawing out bits of yarn of any sort as if we were merely playing at spinning.
('36', 23, 1, 5, 47555) Spinning in fact, means learning all the preliminary processes—sitting down properly, with a mind completely at rest, and spinning daily for a fixed number of hours good, uniform and well twisted yarn, spraying it, measuring its length and taking its weight, rolling it neatly, and, if it is to be sent out to some other place, packing it carefully and sticking a label on it with details of the variety of cotton used, the count, the length and weight of the yarn, and tying a tag on it with particulars of the contributor’s name and address in clear handwriting; when all this is done, one will have completed the spinning yajna for the day.
('36', 23, 1, 6, 48199) Two essential processes, ginning and carding, precede spinning.
('36', 23, 1, 7, 48263) In the analogy between spinning yajna and chapati yajna, ginning corres ponds to milling the wheat—and one may not mind where this is rare—and carding to kneading the flour and making rolls.
('36', 23, 1, 8, 48454) Just as we may not have rolls made from dough at any place we choose but should make them on the spot where the chapatis are being prepared, so carding also should be done at the place where the spinning is done.
('36', 23, 1, 9, 48667) The only latitude which may be permitted is that in a family one person makes the dough and the rolls, while others make and bake the chapatis.
('36', 23, 1, 10, 48811) If they go beyond this, the chapatis would be spoiled and the chapati yajna ruined.
('36', 23, 1, 11, 48895) Similarly, carding may be done, for the sake of convenience, by one person at the same place where others are doing spinning.
('36', 23, 1, 12, 49021) If they go beyond this, the yarn would be spoiled and the spinning yajna, too, would be ruined.
('36', 23, 1, 13, 49117) Carding is a very easy process, and the carding bow can be easily made and is available too.
('36', 23, 1, 14, 49210) At any place where bamboo is easily available, a carding bow for use at home can be made in no time.
('36', 23, 1, 15, 49311) However one for whom the spinning yajna has not become a passion may buy a bow for one’s use, but every spinner must learn carding.
('36', 23, 1, 16, 49443) Carding, I need not add, includes the making of slivers from the cotton carded.
('36', 23, 1, 17, 49523) Such cotton corresponds to the dough and the slivers to rolls.
('36', 23, 1, 18, 49586) All others whose attitude to spinning has been like that of the correspondent above will, I trust, understand henceforth what spinning means.

('36', 24, 3, 4, 49837) I have your letter and the newspaper cuttings for which I thank you.
('36', 24, 3, 5, 49906) You have certainly reversed the ordinary order.
('36', 24, 3, 6, 49954) People first do some good work and then do some good writing.
('36', 24, 3, 7, 50016) You evidently propose to qualify as a good writer and then a good worker.

('36', 24, 6, 12, 50186) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, July 11, 1926
('36', 24, 7, 13, 50223) BHAISHRI DHARAMSHI BHANJI,
('36', 24, 8, 14, 50250) It is only today 2 I am able to answer your tenacious questions.
('36', 24, 8, 15, 50315) It is not right, I think, to discuss so many questions in Navajivan.
('36', 24, 8, 16, 50384) I am quite pleased with your questions.
('36', 24, 8, 17, 50424) I now answer them one by one.
('36', 24, 8, 18, 50454) One who is ready to immolate himself for the sake of truth should not bother about protecting his body, but he should do so to the extent necessary for the purpose of realizing truth.
('36', 24, 8, 19, 50638) I do not think it wrong to take the weight of the body, and so on, with a view to studying the physical effects of a fast undertaken for a moral purpose.
('36', 24, 8, 20, 50792) But it is possible that in so doing one may succumb to temptation.
('36', 24, 8, 21, 50859) God alone knows whether I have ever fallen a prey to temptation.
('36', 24, 8, 22, 50924) My renunciation of activities is only in the interest of health.
('36', 24, 8, 23, 50989) If it is incorrect to call it renunciation of activities where a person has limited his activities to a certain field, let us call it limitation of sphere.
('36', 24, 8, 24, 51145) This limitation is not based on moralconsiderations; hence there is no room for any illusion either gross or subtle.
('36', 24, 8, 25, 51262) We cannot know the outcome of many things, and yet we experiment with them; so too with diet.
('36', 24, 8, 26, 51356) Even from the point of view of abstention there is full scope for discrimination in regard to diet.
('36', 24, 8, 27, 51456) My service to India includes service to all creatures, because
('36', 24, 9, 28, 51519) 1 The identity of the addressee, who was in Ceylon, is not known.
('36', 24, 9, 29, 51585) 2 Gandhiji had received from the addressee a letter dated May 21, 1926.
('36', 25, 0, 1, 51657) 26 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 25, 1, 2, 51698) mine is a non violent service.
('36', 25, 1, 3, 51729) One who serves another selflessly and without any attachment serves all.
('36', 25, 1, 4, 51802) It is not for me to permit anyone to fight.
('36', 25, 1, 5, 51846) I would only show to those who want to fight what, I think, their duty is.
('36', 25, 1, 6, 51921) I agree, one gets results according to one’s prarabdha 1 but as we cannot peep into the future, let us put forth our best efforts regardless of results.
('36', 25, 1, 7, 52074) When the rule of the just prevails, it would be my duty to earn my living and be a burden to none.
('36', 25, 1, 8, 52173) I know of no religion which cannot be put into practice.
('36', 25, 1, 9, 52230) Instead of modifying dharma to suit the ways of the world, why not change these to conform to dharma?
('36', 25, 1, 10, 52332) All practices that are contrary to dharma deserve to be abjured.
('36', 25, 1, 11, 52397) What I regard as the truth is not dependent on its acceptance as such by the world.
('36', 25, 1, 12, 52481) That alone I believe [as truth] which I have experienced myself.
('36', 25, 1, 13, 52546) A Shastra which condones adharma while upholding dharma is to that extent unworthy of honour.
('36', 25, 1, 14, 52640) I believe some rare persons can know the nature of the universe and of its Ruler; but none can describe it.
('36', 25, 1, 15, 52748) That being so, I think, theological differences will persist.
('36', 25, 1, 16, 52810) If a man who has many wives frees himself of passions, etc., and regards them all as his mothers or sisters, he can certainly qualify himself for moksha.
('36', 25, 1, 17, 52964) The passion that dwells in the senses is contrary to human nature and should therefore be abandoned.
('36', 25, 1, 18, 53065) Man and woman are both born free.
('36', 25, 1, 19, 53099) Hence when one is overwhelmed by passion and loses oneself, what else shall we call it if not going astray?
('36', 25, 1, 20, 53207) If a man and his wife cannot get on after marriage, is that reason enough for a divorce?
('36', 25, 1, 21, 53296) The bond between father and son does not come to an end on account of disagreement; I regard the bond between husband and wife as similar.
('36', 25, 1, 22, 53435) If they cannot see eye to eye, they may well have recourse to non co operation.
('36', 25, 1, 23, 53515) But once the marital bond has been established, it can never be dharma to act contrary to it.
('36', 25, 1, 24, 53609) That a man may indulge in sex pleasures with one woman and none other and that too for the sake ofprogeny and similarly a woman with one man is, I believe, the farthest limit that he or she can have.
('36', 25, 1, 25, 53809) Time goes on doing its work.
('36', 25, 1, 26, 53838) Our manliness lies in foreseeing its changes and putting in the right efforts.
('36', 25, 2, 27, 53917) 1 Fruits of accumulated deeds of previous births
('36', 26, 0, 1, 53966) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 27
('36', 26, 1, 2, 54009) It is quite possible that those whom we regard as having attained moksha might not in fact have attained it.
('36', 26, 1, 3, 54118) But those who have really attained moksha are a manifestation of God Himself, because they cannot be thought of as apart from Him.
('36', 26, 1, 4, 54249) I am not able to understand your next question.
('36', 26, 1, 5, 54297) I am against purdah for women because it shows man’s meanness and his oppression of the weaker sex.
('36', 26, 1, 6, 54397) It is quite possible that the steps I take or advocate may in future prove disastrous instead of being beneficial.
('36', 26, 1, 7, 54512) Of course my own conviction is that each and every step of mine will turn out to be beneficial in the end.
('36', 26, 1, 8, 54619) If I do not have this faith I shall be doing offence to my truth and I should as well end my life.
('36', 26, 1, 9, 54718) For, even if I may choose to be quiet I would still go on seeing visions of many worlds.
('36', 26, 1, 10, 54807) In prophet Mohammed’s life, we come across many acts of kindness.
('36', 26, 1, 11, 54873) I do not know if Lord Mahavir has laid down two distinct standards—one for dharma and the other for worldly life.
('36', 26, 1, 12, 54987) So far as I understand Jainism, I think it has no such compartments.
('36', 26, 1, 13, 55056) Passages which are apparently suggestive of different standards can be interpreted to agree with what I say; for example, the mahavrat 1 and Anuvrat 2. Religion exhorts us all clearly to follow only the Mahavrat; but if we cannot do it, we should at least follow the Anuvrat instead of resigning ourselves to a life of sin.
('36', 26, 2, 14, 55380) A gun manufacturer is certainly responsible for the destruction caused by the guns he makes.
('36', 26, 2, 15, 55473) The object of a man’s life is said to be realization of the self.
('36', 26, 2, 16, 55539) A convention which runs counter to human nature certainly deserves to be broken.
('36', 26, 2, 17, 55620) Even otherwise it is bound to go.
('36', 26, 2, 18, 55654) If an infant tries to hold a fire brand, its parents and the world have a right to check it.
('36', 26, 2, 19, 55747) Nobody has any further right.
('36', 26, 3, 20, 55777) Since God has not endowed man with the power of creating even a single life, how at all can he have the right to inflict capital punishment?
('36', 26, 3, 21, 55918) I have remained absolutely free from the habit of masturbation.
('36', 26, 3, 22, 55982) Even today I am not able to understand it.
('36', 26, 3, 23, 56025) I shudder at the thought of it.
('36', 26, 3, 24, 56057) I have no doubt whatever that a man who practises it would become weak in body and mind.
('36', 26, 3, 25, 56146) I know of manysuch cases.
('36', 26, 3, 26, 56172) The remedy for it is that those who wish to reform themselves should shun solitude and as far as possible keep both their hands as well as
('36', 26, 4, 27, 56311) 1 Literally, major vows in Jainism, ahimsa, satya, asteya, brahmacharya, aparigraha, practised by ascetics

('36', 27, 1, 3, 56544) They should take sattvika 1 food, which is easy to digest, go for walks in the open air and repeat Ramanama.
('36', 27, 1, 4, 56653) Marriage is no remedy for bad habits.
('36', 27, 1, 5, 56691) A child of five, seven or ten years contracts a bad habit; is it due to want of the married state?
('36', 27, 1, 6, 56790) Wherever I go, I see immeasurable unhappiness caused by child marr iages.
('36', 27, 1, 7, 56864) I have known no benefit flowing from child marriages.
('36', 27, 1, 8, 56918) I return your questions as they would help you understand my answers.

('36', 27, 9, 19, 57445) THE ASHRAM, July 11, 1926
('36', 27, 10, 20, 57471) DEAR FRIEND, I have your long letter.
('36', 27, 10, 21, 57509) I read the whole of it with care.
('36', 27, 10, 22, 57543) I am glad that you wrote it.
('36', 27, 10, 23, 57572) I liked it very much, since you have poured out your heart in it.
('36', 27, 10, 24, 57638) I take it, moreover, as a sign of friendship that you took all this trouble to arrange your ideas and put them compactly before me.
('36', 27, 10, 25, 57770) I, therefore, welcome your letter from every point of view.
('36', 27, 11, 26, 57830) 1 Pure and wholesome 2 The addressee had suggested in his letter of June 18, 1926 that the English rendering of Gandhiji’s autobiography which was being serially published in Young India had better be done by Valji Govindji Desai.
('36', 28, 0, 1, 58061) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 29
('36', 28, 1, 2, 58104) I am replying in Gujarati, since I shall never have the courage to write to a Gujarati in English, and I am dictating the letter since otherwise you would find difficulty in reading my handwriting and I would be going against doctors’ advice that I should do as little writing as possible with my hand.
('36', 28, 1, 3, 58407) Please rest assured that the views I had formed about you long ago remain unaltered.
('36', 28, 1, 4, 58492) You have not changed; if anyone, I have changed, though I think I too have not.
('36', 28, 1, 5, 58572) How could all that was in me come out at one time, without the circumstances to draw it out?
('36', 28, 1, 6, 58665) Circumstances made me a non co operator.
('36', 28, 1, 7, 58706) To others, that may appear as a change in me.
('36', 28, 1, 8, 58752) But so far as I am concerned, I was being true to myself and, therefore, my non co operation was but a manifestation of my real self in relation to particular circumstances.
('36', 28, 1, 9, 58926) One may see me bare bodied in summer and wrapped up in clothes in winter and might think that I had changed.
('36', 28, 1, 10, 59035) The truth is that I have not changed at all.
('36', 28, 1, 11, 59080) I merely responded in the appropriate manner to changed circumstances.
('36', 28, 1, 12, 59151) However, no matter what differences of opinion arise between us, I shall always feel the attraction of your virtues which first drew me towards you.
('36', 28, 2, 13, 59300) From some of my actions you have reached the conclusion that I would use any means to gain my end.
('36', 28, 2, 14, 59399) It is absolutely against my nature to act in that manner.
('36', 28, 2, 15, 59457) I have stated time and again, and proved through my actions, that I believe means and ends to be intimately inter connected.
('36', 28, 2, 16, 59582) That is, a good end can never be achieved through bad means.
('36', 28, 2, 17, 59643) I had given the most careful thought to the problem of the Khilafat before making the cause my own.
('36', 28, 2, 18, 59743) If I had not believed in its justice, I would never have lent my support to the Muslims.
('36', 28, 2, 19, 59832) This of course does not mean that it was, or is, necessary for me, for the sakeof my dharma, to support the Khilafat movement, but I certainly held, and I still hold, that the Muslim claim was just from their own point of view and that, from the standpoint of morality, there was nothing objectionable in it.
('36', 28, 2, 20, 60141) I, therefore, believed it to be the moral duty of every Hindu to stand by them in their suffering.
('36', 28, 2, 21, 60240) I still cling to these views and do not repent having helped the Muslims in their fight for the Khilafat.
('36', 28, 2, 22, 60346) Nor do I believe that Hindus have suffered by having helped them.
('36', 28, 2, 23, 60412) I think in the same way about non co operation.
('36', 28, 2, 24, 60460) It is a great principle.
('36', 28, 2, 25, 60485) We do not yet understand its full significance.
('36', 28, 2, 26, 60533) If, however, we are ever to see an era of peace, it will be through non violent non co operation.
('36', 28, 2, 27, 60631) I have not relaxed my non co opera tion in any particular.
('36', 28, 2, 28, 60690) Even during the days of the non co operation
('36', 29, 0, 1, 60735) 30 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 29, 1, 2, 60776) movement, I used to meet the Governor, as I did this time 1. Even at that time I used to get documents registered, as I do now, and likewise used to advise a court suit against those who misappropriated Congress funds just as I do now.
('36', 29, 1, 3, 61012) The reason is that non co operation was and is, limited in its application.
('36', 29, 1, 4, 61088) The fact that perfect non violence is impossible to practise while one lives in this body does not vitiate the principle itself.
('36', 29, 1, 5, 61217) And so about non co operation.
('36', 29, 1, 6, 61248) I have never felt ashamed in admitting my errors, and if I believed that the non co op eration movement was a mistake and that it has failed, I would follow Mr. Roy’s advice and certainly proclaim my errors publicly.
('36', 29, 1, 7, 61465) I am, however, convinced that that movement has done the country untold good and that, if we look deep, it has not failed.
('36', 29, 1, 8, 61588) It is true that we have not won swaraj in the sense of political power, but I attach little value to this fact.
('36', 29, 1, 9, 61700) That people’s ideas have changed, that they have become more critical and have acquired courage, is no small gain.
('36', 29, 1, 10, 61815) The value of the movement will be appreciated in the future.
('36', 29, 1, 11, 61876) Being too near it as yet, we cannot judge it aright, This being my view, what am I to confess in public?
('36', 29, 1, 12, 61981) It is of course possible that my view is wrong.
('36', 29, 1, 13, 62029) But so long as I am myself not convinced of the error of my view, how can I, if I love truth, admit any error?
('36', 29, 1, 14, 62140) I aim at self purification even through my political activities; I wish to follow dharma through them, and everyone’s dharma is but what he can see for himself.
('36', 29, 1, 15, 62301) No one has yet discovered absolute dharma which everyone will recognize to be so.
('36', 29, 1, 16, 62383) Such dharma is beyond our power to understand and explain.
('36', 29, 1, 17, 62442) Each one of us has but a glimpse of it, and describes it in his own way.
('36', 29, 1, 18, 62515) Our power is limited to the choice ofmeans and I, therefore, believe that our success lies in preserving the purity of our means.
('36', 29, 2, 19, 62645) About the Congress, too, I feel that you are labouring under a misapprehension.
('36', 29, 2, 20, 62725) It is not for one person to decide who should and who should not remain in it.
('36', 29, 2, 21, 62804) If I could mould the Congress according to my ideas, it would be a different body.
('36', 29, 2, 22, 62887) Moreover, if the Congress were controlled by one person and public opinion was ignored, it would be not a popular body but a one man show.
('36', 29, 2, 23, 63026) There is much else I should like to write.
('36', 29, 2, 24, 63069) It is possible to reply to your arguments about the other issues which you have raised.
('36', 29, 2, 25, 63157) I have picked up only the more important points and tried to meet your arguments.
('36', 29, 2, 26, 63239) Even so, I shall not be dogmatic and do not assert that I am right and you are

('36', 30, 1, 2, 63468) We can both be right, each from his own point of view.
('36', 30, 1, 3, 63523) If we claim to follow the path of truth, how can we say today who is right in an absolute sense?
('36', 30, 1, 4, 63620) The future alone will show who is right; but one thing I have learnt from my varied experience of life, and that is that, though all of us cannot be of the same view, we can learn to tolerate one anther’s views.
('36', 30, 1, 5, 63832) If we do so and if we discuss our views with one another, we can remove all the misunderstandings which may have arisen.
('36', 30, 1, 6, 63953) It is for this reason that I have valued your letter and felt prompted to reply to it.
('36', 30, 1, 7, 64040) I read your letter to Sastri 1. It did not please me as much as your letter to me did.
('36', 30, 1, 8, 64127) I feel that it would have been better if you had not written as you have done at this time when he is in difficulty and that too in reply to a request from him.
('36', 30, 1, 9, 64288) I have passed on to him the cheque which you sent to me, and have made no mention of the copy of your letter to him which you have sent to me.
('36', 30, 1, 10, 64431) If I had known that you held the view about the society 2 which you have expressed, I would not have written to you for help.
('36', 30, 1, 11, 64557) I value the gift you have made though holding the views which you do, and did not, therefore, hesitate to send on your cheque to Sastri.
('36', 30, 1, 12, 64694) Your letter to Sastri, too, seems to me to have been written with the best of motives.

('36', 31, 1, 3, 65365) Those who charge you with rivalry unconsciously give your presence an importance you did not deserve.
('36', 31, 1, 4, 65467) But as there is not much danger of your becoming inflated, let those good people who so charge you have all the pleasure they can derive from their belief.
('36', 31, 1, 5, 65623) The Finland idea is dead and recently buried.
('36', 31, 1, 6, 65669) Dr. Dalal has suspected hydrocele in Devdas.
('36', 31, 1, 7, 65714) Even if it requires an operation it would be a minor thing.
('36', 31, 1, 8, 65774) I certainly don’t worry about it, perhaps, because I don’t dread the knife so much as dread drug taking.
('36', 31, 1, 9, 65879) Poor Santanam!
('36', 31, 1, 10, 65894) It almost appears as if we in India have more than our share of domestic troubles.
('36', 31, 1, 11, 65977) And in India the Southern Presidency seems to take the first place.

('36', 31, 5, 18, 66327) Your contention is over the literal meaning.
('36', 31, 5, 19, 66372) I meant “natural” in its generally accepted sense.
('36', 31, 5, 20, 66423) There is no difficulty in accepting your meaning of the term.
('36', 31, 5, 21, 66485) My argument however stands.
('36', 31, 5, 22, 66513) Only it will have to be presented in a different way.
('36', 31, 5, 23, 66567) If you consider the examples I have cited, I am sure you will not think my position mistaken.
('36', 31, 5, 24, 66661) I see nothing wrong in the view you take.
('36', 31, 5, 25, 66703) After all we both mean that one should not be licentious but exercise self control.
('36', 31, 5, 26, 66787) And if one is licentious by nature it is one’s duty to change that nature.

('36', 32, 10, 19, 68004) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('36', 32, 10, 20, 68037) I do not know exactly what you really want to organize.

('36', 33, 1, 2, 68349) year which is not otherwise occupied, you want a scheme for providing them with spinning work.
('36', 33, 1, 3, 68444) Or, in order to popularize khaddar amongst the middle class and in order ultimately to cheapen khaddar by voluntary spinning, you may wish to organize a voluntary spinners’ association; or you may want to do both.
('36', 33, 1, 4, 68658) Further, besides spinning wheels, you want some facility for maintaining them when they go out of order.
('36', 33, 1, 5, 68763) You need slivers and, therefore, the assistance of carders.
('36', 33, 1, 6, 68823) And, if you have cotton growing near you, you will want to gin your own cotton and, therefore, you would require hand ginning apparatus.
('36', 33, 1, 7, 68960) One carder can feed ten spinners each 100 tolas and one ginning apparatus can feed 6 middle sized bows, 2_ lbs.
('36', 33, 1, 8, 69072) cotton.
('36', 33, 1, 9, 69080) A hand ginning apparatus costs Rs. 7/ .
('36', 33, 1, 10, 69120) A middle sized carding bow costs Rs. 5/ .
('36', 33, 1, 11, 69162) Both these things can be and should be locally made.
('36', 33, 1, 12, 69215) I would also suggest your opening a small khaddar store, if there are at least 400 subscribers who would purchase khaddar for a minimum sum of Rs. 10 per year.
('36', 33, 1, 13, 69375) The Rs. 10 should be deposited beforehand.
('36', 33, 1, 14, 69418) If this can be done, in the store you can have a spinner, carder and ginner to demonstrate the three processes for voluntary spinners.
('36', 33, 1, 15, 69553) Every voluntary spinner should be able to do his own carding.
('36', 33, 1, 16, 69615) For paid spinners the custom in every part of India varies.
('36', 33, 1, 17, 69675) Some spinners require slivers, i.e., carded cotton rolled into strips for spinners to work with, and in some other parts, the spinners do their own carding and take away cotton.
('36', 33, 1, 18, 69853) It is difficult for me to send a demonstrator from here.
('36', 33, 1, 19, 69910) I would suggest your putting yourself in touch with Mr. Ramanathan who is the agent of the All India Spinners’ Association in Tamilnadu.

('36', 33, 6, 27, 70298) I knew that some such hitch will come in the way of your coming here although your telegram received yesterday was absolutely emphatic.

('36', 34, 1, 2, 70501) coming for some other tour or merely to pass a few days here.
('36', 34, 1, 3, 70563) But Dastane, I know, had lost all heart.
('36', 34, 1, 4, 70604) He has been so often put off and he had built this time upon all of you going.
('36', 34, 1, 5, 70683) He wants either all or none.
('36', 34, 1, 6, 70712) Hence, I suppose his telegram to you.
('36', 34, 1, 7, 70750) It really cannot be helped.
('36', 34, 1, 8, 70778) Manilal and Jamnalalji have agreed to hold themselves free in September and, if you can also be definitely free then, you may undertake a tour or two during this year.
('36', 34, 1, 9, 70946) But, if you cannot be free in September, I have reconciled myself to no tours during this year.
('36', 34, 1, 10, 71042) If we can organize what we have on a sound businesslike basis, it will be sufficient compensation for no tours.
('36', 34, 1, 11, 71154) I have therefore sent you a wire 1
('36', 34, 2, 12, 71189) today advising development of your own special work.
('36', 34, 2, 13, 71242) After all, it takes all your energy.
('36', 34, 3, 14, 71279) Here is a letter from the manager of Balaramapuram Ashram and a copy of my reply 2 to him which speaks for itself.
('36', 34, 3, 15, 71394) Please do whatever is necessary and if you know the manager, correspond with him before he writes to you.

('36', 35, 4, 7, 72341) Newspapers tell us that Miss Emily Hobhouse is no more.
('36', 35, 4, 8, 72397) She was one of the noblest and bravest of women.
('36', 35, 4, 9, 72446) She worked without ever thinking of any reward.
('36', 35, 4, 10, 72494) Hers was service of humanity dedicated to God.
('36', 35, 4, 11, 72541) She belonged to a noble English family.
('36', 35, 4, 12, 72581) She loved her country and because she loved it, she could not tolerate any injustice done by it.
('36', 35, 4, 13, 72678) She realized the atrocity of the Boer War.
('36', 35, 4, 14, 72721) She thought England was wholly in the wrong.
('36', 35, 4, 15, 72766) She denounced the war in burning language at a time when England was mad on it.
('36', 35, 4, 16, 72846) She went to South Africa and her whole soul rose against the barbarity of the concentration camps which Lord Kitchener thought were necessary if the war was to be won.
('36', 35, 4, 17, 73014) It was then that William Stead led prayers for English reverses.
('36', 35, 4, 18, 73079) Emily Hobhouse, frail as her body was, went again to South Africa at great personal risk to court insults and worse.
('36', 35, 4, 19, 73196) She was imprisoned and sent back.
('36', 35, 4, 20, 73230) She bore it all with the courage of a true heroine.
('36', 35, 4, 21, 73282) she steeled the hearts of Boer women and told them never to lose hope.
('36', 35, 4, 22, 73353) She told them that though England had gone mad, there were Englishmen and English women whose sympathies were with the Boers and that some day their voice would be heard.
('36', 35, 4, 23, 73524) And so it was.
('36', 35, 4, 24, 73539) Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman swept the board at the general election of 1906 and made to the wronged Boers such reparation as was possible.
('36', 35, 4, 25, 73679) It was after the war and when satyagraha was going on that I had the privilege of being known to Miss Hobhouse.
('36', 35, 4, 26, 73791) The acquaintance ripened into a life long friendship.
('36', 35, 4, 27, 73845) She played no mean part at the settlement of 1914. She was General Botha’s guest.
('36', 35, 4, 28, 73927) Now General Botha had uniformly repelled my advances for an interview.
('36', 35, 4, 29, 73998) Every time he referred me to the Home Minister.
('36', 35, 4, 30, 74046) But Miss Hobhouse insisted on General Botha seeing me.
('36', 35, 4, 31, 74101) And so she arranged for a meeting between the General, his wife and herself and me at the General’s residence in Cape Town.
('36', 35, 4, 32, 74225) Hers was a name to conjure with among the Boers.
('36', 35, 4, 33, 74274) And she made my way smooth among them by throwing in the whole weight of her influence with the Indian cause.
('36', 36, 0, 1, 74384) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 37
('36', 36, 1, 2, 74427) When I came to India and the Rowlatt Act agitation was going on, she wrote saying that I must end my life in prison if not on the gallows and that she did not deplore it.
('36', 36, 1, 3, 74598) She herself had full strength for such sacrifice.
('36', 36, 1, 4, 74648) It was an article of faith with her that no cause prospered without the sacrifice of its votaries.
('36', 36, 1, 5, 74747) Only last year she wrote to me saying that she was in active correspondence with her friend General Hertzog about the Indian cause in South Africa, asked me not to feel bitter against him and told me to tell her what I expected of General Hertzog.
('36', 36, 1, 6, 74995) Let the women of India treasure the memory of this great English woman.
('36', 36, 1, 7, 75067) She never married.
('36', 36, 1, 8, 75086) Her life was pure as crystal.
('36', 36, 1, 9, 75116) She gave herself to God’s service.
('36', 36, 1, 10, 75151) Physically she was a perfect wreck.
('36', 36, 1, 11, 75187) She was paralytic.
('36', 36, 1, 12, 75206) But in that weak and diseased body she had a soul that could defy the might of kings and emperors with their armies.
('36', 36, 1, 13, 75323) She feared no man because she feared God only.

('36', 36, 4, 16, 75427) A student in a national college has written a long letter of which I give the substance as follows:
('36', 36, 5, 17, 75527) You are aware that in the year 1920 many students all over India left Government controlled institutions.
('36', 36, 5, 18, 75633) Several national institutions were started.
('36', 36, 5, 19, 75677) Some have already gone under.
('36', 36, 5, 20, 75707) The one that I know is a poor affair.
('36', 36, 5, 21, 75745) It may be called a foreign imitation under national control minus discipline.
('36', 36, 5, 22, 75823) Many of our teachers do not know the distinction between khaddar and foreign or mill made cloth.
('36', 36, 5, 23, 75920) They dress likeSahebs and though themselves dressed in foreign cloth would not mind talking to us about swadeshi.
('36', 36, 5, 24, 76034) They remind one of drunkards advising others to give up liquor.
('36', 36, 5, 25, 76098) They talk of the spirit of sacrifice and the value of joining national institutions when they send their own sons or other relatives to Government controlled schools or colleges.
('36', 36, 5, 26, 76277) In fact, there is very little love lost between them and us.
('36', 36, 5, 27, 76338) Do you wonder at many students having gone back to Government institutions?
('36', 36, 5, 28, 76414) A few of us however still remain out.
('36', 36, 5, 29, 76452) But how long can we do so?
('36', 36, 5, 30, 76479) I would like to prosecute my studies in Germany, but my pecuniary circumstances do not allow me to do so.
('36', 36, 5, 31, 76585) Can you not send me to the Berlin or any other European University?
('36', 37, 0, 1, 76653) 38 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 37, 1, 2, 76694) The writer has given me his own full name and the name of the institution and all other available particulars.
('36', 37, 1, 3, 76805) I have purposely refrained from giving the name of the institution and further particulars.
('36', 37, 1, 4, 76897) For, I do not know enough of it and I could not be party to the specific condemnation of any institution without having studied it.
('36', 37, 1, 5, 77029) Public purpose is sufficiently served by publishing the general complaint so that those institutions to which the complaint may be applicable may examine themselves and remove all cause of complaint.
('36', 37, 1, 6, 77229) There is no doubt that in several national institutions things have not been as they should have been and that the professors or teachers have not conformed to the elementary requirements of the Congress programme in so far as it is applicable to national institutions.
('36', 37, 1, 7, 77499) Teachers who themselves do not believe in non violence or truth or non co operation cannot impart to their students the spirit of any of these things.
('36', 37, 1, 8, 77650) If they send their children to Government schools, they may not expect to enthuse their pupils over national institutions.
('36', 37, 1, 9, 77773) Nor may they expect to infect their pupils with love of the charkha or khaddar, if they will not spin themselves or wear khaddar.
('36', 37, 1, 10, 77903) It is hardly necessary to remark that all national institutions do not deserve the description that the writer gives of the one to which he has belonged.
('36', 37, 1, 11, 78057) But, the point I desire to emphasize in connection with this letter is that there should be no sorrow felt over one’s sacrifice.
('36', 37, 1, 12, 78186) That sacrifice which causes pain loses its sacred character and will break down under stress.
('36', 37, 1, 13, 78280) One gives up things that one considers to be injurious and therefore there should be pleasure attendant upon the giving up.
('36', 37, 1, 14, 78404) Whether the substitute is effective or not is a different question altogether.
('36', 37, 1, 15, 78483) If the substitute is effective, it is no doubt well, but it is well also even if the substitute is ineffective.
('36', 37, 1, 16, 78595) It must lead to an effort to procure a better substitute, but surely not to a return to what has been given up after full knowledge and experience of its harmful character.
('36', 37, 1, 17, 78768) This hankering after going to Berlin or to some other European University is not a sign of the spirit of non co operation.
('36', 37, 1, 18, 78891) It is on par with substituting Japanese cloth for the English manufacture.
('36', 37, 1, 19, 78966) We give up English cloth not because it is English, but because it robs the poor of their hereditary employment and therefore makes them poorer still.
('36', 37, 1, 20, 79117) The Japanese substitute robs the poor no less than the English cloth.
('36', 37, 1, 21, 79187) Similarly, we give up Government institutions because of their harmful character.
('36', 37, 1, 22, 79269) We may not therefore reproduce the same thing under a different name and hug to ourselves the belief that we are non co operators.
('36', 37, 1, 23, 79400) Non co operation means co operation with all
('36', 38, 0, 1, 79445) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 39
('36', 38, 1, 2, 79488) that is best in the Indian spirit.
('36', 38, 1, 3, 79523) We cannot cultivate that taste by being in Berlin.
('36', 38, 1, 4, 79574) It is in India that all our experiments must be made.
('36', 38, 1, 5, 79628) Till at least we arrive at a complete and effective substitute, the first step, it is quite plain, must be the giving up of Government institutions.
('36', 38, 1, 6, 79777) Those students there fore who took that step did well if they understood what they were doing.
('36', 38, 1, 7, 79872) And only the sacrifice of such students will be of increasing benefit to the country as time passes.
('36', 38, 1, 8, 79973) But those who are repenting or dissatisfied with their own lot should certainly have no hesitation in going back to Government institutions.
('36', 38, 1, 9, 80114) After all it is a conflict of ideal and if the ideal that non co operation stands for is good and is congenial to the Indian soil, it will triumph over every conceivable obstacle.

('36', 38, 3, 11, 80317) 39. ‘TOWARDS MORAL BANKRUPTCY’ III
('36', 38, 4, 12, 80352) It is one thing when married people regulate, so far as it is humanly possible, the number of their progeny by moral restraint, and totally another when they do so in spite of sexual indulgence and by means adopted to obviate the result of such indulgence.
('36', 38, 4, 13, 80609) In the one case, the people gain in every respect.
('36', 38, 4, 14, 80660) In the other there is nothing but harm.
('36', 38, 4, 15, 80700) M. Bureau has produced figures and diagrams to show that the increasing use of contraceptives for the purpose of giving free play to animal passions and yet obviating the natural results of such indulgence has resulted in the birth rate being much lower than the death rate, not in Paris only, but in the whole of France.
('36', 38, 4, 16, 81022) Out of 87 areas into which France is divided, in 68 the birth rate is lower than the deathrate.
('36', 38, 4, 17, 81118) In one case, i.e., Lot, deaths were 162 against 100 births.
('36', 38, 4, 18, 81178) The next comes Tarn et Garonne with 156 deaths against l00 births.
('36', 38, 4, 19, 81245) Even out of 19 areas where the birth rate is higher than the death rate, the difference is negligible in several cases.
('36', 38, 4, 20, 81365) In ten areas alone is there an effective difference.
('36', 38, 4, 21, 81418) The lowest death rate, that is 72 against l00 births, occurs in Morbihan and Pas de Calais.
('36', 38, 4, 22, 81510) M. Bureau shows that this process of depopulation, which he calls ‘voluntary death’, has not yet been arrested.
('36', 38, 4, 23, 81622) M. Bureau then examines the condition of French Provinces in detail and he quotes the following paragraph from M. Gide written in l914, about Normandy:
('36', 38, 5, 24, 81774) Normandy has lost in the course of 50 years more than 300,000
('36', 39, 0, 1, 81836) 40 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 39, 1, 2, 81877) inhabitants, that is to say, a population equal to that of the whole department of the Orne.
('36', 39, 1, 3, 81970) Every 20 years she now loses the equivalent of a department, and as she includes but five, a century will be enough to see her fat meadows empty of Frenchmen—I say advisedly of Frenchmen, for assuredly others will come to occupy them, and it would be a pity were it otherwise.
('36', 39, 1, 4, 82247) Germans work the iron mines round Caen, and for the first time, only yesterday, a vanguard of Chinese labourers landed where William the Conqueror set sail for England.
('36', 39, 1, 5, 82416) And M. Bureau adds by way of comment on the paragraph,
('36', 39, 2, 6, 82471) How many other provinces are in no better condition!
('36', 39, 2, 7, 82524) He then goes on to show that this deterioration in population has inevitably led to the deterioration in the military strength of the nation.
('36', 39, 2, 8, 82666) He believes that the cessation of emigration from France is also due to the same cause.
('36', 39, 2, 9, 82754) He then traces to the same cause the decay of French communal expansion, the decay of French commerce and the French language and culture.
('36', 39, 3, 10, 82893) M. Bureau then asks:
('36', 39, 4, 11, 82914) Are the French people who have rejected the ancient sexual discipline more advanced in securing happiness, material prosperity, physical health, and in intellectual culture?
('36', 39, 4, 12, 83088) He answers:
('36', 39, 5, 13, 83100) With regard to the improvement in health, a few words will suffice.
('36', 39, 5, 14, 83168) However strong our wish to answer all objections methodically, it is all the same very difficult to take seriously the assertion that sexual emancipation, would tend to strengthen one’s body and improve one’s health.
('36', 39, 5, 15, 83385) On every side one hears of the diminished vigour of both, young people and adults.
('36', 39, 5, 16, 83468) Before the war the military authorities had to lower, time after time, the physical standard of the recruits, and the power of endurance has seriously diminished throughout the whole nation.
('36', 39, 5, 17, 83659) Doubtless it would be unjust to maintain that lack of moral discipline is alone responsible for this decline, but it has a large share in it, together with alcoholism, insanitary housing, etc.; and if we look closely we shall easily discover that this indiscipline and the sentiments which perpetuate it are the strongest allies of these other scourges.
('36', 39, 5, 18, 84013) The frightful extension of venereal diseases has done incalculable injury to the public health.
('36', 39, 5, 19, 84109) M. Bureau even disputes the theory advanced by Neo Malthu sians that the wealth of individuals in a society which regulates its births increases in proportion to the restriction it imposes upon them, and fortifies his answer by comparing the favourable German
('36', 40, 0, 1, 84369) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 41
('36', 40, 1, 2, 84412) birth rate and her increasing material prosperity with the decreasing birth rate of France side by side with its decreasing wealth.
('36', 40, 1, 3, 84544) Nor has the phenomenal expansion of German trade, M. Bureau contends, been attained at the cost of the German workmen more than elsewhere.
('36', 40, 1, 4, 84683) He quotes M. Rossignol:
('36', 40, 2, 5, 84707) People died of hunger in Germany when she had but 41,000,000 inhabitants: they have become richer and richer since she numbered 68,000,000. And adds:
('36', 40, 3, 6, 84857) These people, who are by no means ascetic, found it possible to place annually in the savings banks sums which in 1911 amounted to 22,000 million francs; while in 1895 the deposits only reached 8,000 millions, an increase of 850 millions a year.
('36', 40, 3, 7, 85103) The following paragraph which M. Bureau writes after describing the technical progress of Germans about the general culture will be read with much interest:
('36', 40, 4, 8, 85260) Without being initiated into the depths of sociology one can have no doubt of it, for it is quite evident, that such technical progress would have been impossible had not workmen of a more refined type, foreman more highly educated perfectly trained engineers been found.
('36', 40, 4, 9, 85532) The Industrial schools are of three kinds: professional, numbering over 500, with 70,000 pupils; technical, still more numerous, and some of them with over 1,000 pupils; lastly, the colleges devoted to higher instruction with their 15,000 pupils, which confer, like the Universities, the envied title of doctor .
('36', 40, 4, 10, 85845) 365 commercial schools attract 31,000 pupils and in innumerable schools courses of agriculture give instruction to over 90,000. What, compared with these 400,000 pupils in the different lines of the production of wealth, are the 35,000 pupils of our professional courses, and why, since l,770,000 of our people, of whom 779,798 are below eighteen years of age, live by the cultivation of the soil, are there but 3,225 pupils in our special schools of agriculture?
('36', 40, 4, 11, 86309) M. Bureau is careful enough to note that all this phenomenal rise of Germany is not entirely due to the surplus of births over deaths, but he does contend with justice that, given other favourable conditions, a preponderating birth rate is an indispensable condition of national growth.
('36', 40, 4, 12, 86596) Indeed, the proposition he has set forth to prove is that a growing birth rate is in no way inconsistent with great material prosperity and moral progress.
('36', 40, 4, 13, 86752) We in India are not in the position of France so far as our birth rate is concerned.
('36', 40, 4, 14, 86837) But it may be said that the
('36', 41, 0, 1, 86865) 42 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 41, 1, 2, 86906) preponderating birth rate in India, unlike as in Germany, is no advantage to our national growth.
('36', 41, 1, 3, 87004) But I must not anticipate the chapter that will have to be set apart for a consideration of Indian conditions in the light of M. Bureau’s facts and figures and conclusions.
('36', 41, 1, 4, 87177) After dealing with an examination of German conditions where birth rate preponderates the death rate, M. Bureau says:
('36', 41, 2, 5, 87295) Are we not aware that France occupies the fourth place–and that a very long way below the third–in regard to the total sum of national wealth?
('36', 41, 2, 6, 87438) France has an annual revenue from her investments of 25,000 million francs, while the Germans are drawing from their investments a revenue estimated at 50,000 million francs....
('36', 41, 2, 7, 87616) Our national soil has suffered in thirty five years, from 1879 to 1914, a depreciation of 40,000 million Francs, and is worth only 52,000 instead of 92,000 millions!
('36', 41, 2, 8, 87782) Whole departments of the country lack men to work the soil, and there are districts where one sees scarcely any but old men.
('36', 41, 2, 9, 87907) He adds that:
('36', 41, 3, 10, 87921) Moral indiscipline and systematic sterility means the diminution of natural abilities in the community, and the undisputed predominance of the old men in social life.
('36', 41, 3, 11, 88088) In France, there are but 170 children and young people to every 1,000 inhabitants, while, in Germany, there are 220, in England, 210. .
('36', 41, 3, 12, 88224) The proportion of the old is greater than it should be and the others who are prematurely aged through moral indiscipline and voluntary sterility share in all the senile fears of a debilitated race.
('36', 41, 3, 13, 88423) The author then observes
('36', 41, 4, 14, 88448) We know that the immense majority of French people are indifferent to this domestic position (slack morals) of their rulers, thanks to the convenient theory of the ‘wall round private life’.
('36', 41, 4, 15, 88639) And he quotes with sorrow the following observation of M. Leopold Monod:
('36', 41, 5, 16, 88712) It is a fine thing to go to war in order to cast down infamous abuses, and to break the chains of those who we suffer from them.
('36', 41, 5, 17, 88841) But how about men whose fears have not known how to guard their consciences from enticements; men whose courage is at the mercy of a caress or a fit of sulks; .
('36', 41, 5, 18, 89002) men who with no shame, perhaps glorying in the exploit, repudiate the vow which in a joyous and solemn hour they made to the wife of their youth; men who burden their home with the tyranny of an exaggerated and selfish egotism—how can such men be liberators?
('36', 41, 5, 19, 89261) The author then sums up:
('36', 42, 0, 1, 89286) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 43
('36', 42, 1, 2, 89329) Thus, whichever way we turn, we always find that the various forms of our moral indiscipline have caused serious hurt to the individual, the family, and society at large, and have inflicted on us suffering which is literally inexpressible.
('36', 42, 1, 3, 89569) The licentious conduct of our young people, prostitution, pornography, and marriages for money, vanity or luxury, adultery and divorce, voluntary sterility and abortion, have debilitated the nation and stopped its increase; the individual has been unable to conserve his energies, and the quality of the new growth has diminished simultaneously with its quantity.
('36', 42, 1, 4, 89933) ‘Fewer births and more fine men” was the watch word, which had something enticing about it for those who, shut up in their materialistic conception of individual and social life, thought they could assimilate the breeding of men to that of sheep or horses.
('36', 42, 1, 5, 90190) As Auguste Comte said with stinging force, these pretended physians of our social ills would have done better to become veterinary surgeons, incapable as they always were of comprehending the infinite complexity of the psychology both of the individual and of the society.
('36', 42, 2, 6, 90463) The truth is that of all the attitudes which a man adopts, of all the decisions, at which he arrives, of all the habits which he contracts, there is none which exerts over his personal and social life an influence comparable to that exerted by his attitudes, his decisions, and his habits with regard to the appeals of the sexual appetite.
('36', 42, 2, 7, 90803) Whether he resists and controls them, or whether he yields and allows himself to be controlled by them, the most remote regions of social life will experience the echo of his action, since nature has ordained that the most hidden and intimate action should produce infinite repercussions.
('36', 42, 3, 8, 91092) Thanks to this very mystery, we like to persuade ourselves, when we violate in any way the moral discipline, that our misdeed will have no grievous consequence.
('36', 42, 3, 9, 91253) As to ourselves, in the first place, we are satisfied, since our own interest or pleasure has been the motive of our action; as to society at large, we think it is so high above our modest selves that it will not even notice our misdeeds; and, above all, we secretly hope that “the others” will have the sense to remain devout and virtuous.
('36', 42, 3, 10, 91594) The worst of it is that this cowardly calculation almost succeeds while our conduct is as yet an abnormal and exceptional act; then, proud of our success, we persevere in our attitude, and when there is occasion we come—and this is our supreme punishment–to believe it lawful.
('36', 42, 4, 11, 91871) But a day comes when the example given by this conduct involves other defections; each of our evil deeds has the result of making more difficult and more heroic that attachment to virtue which we have counted on in “the
('36', 43, 0, 1, 92091) 44 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 43, 1, 2, 92132) others”, and our neighbour, tired of being duped, is now in a hurry to imitate us.
('36', 43, 1, 3, 92215) That day the downfall begins and each can estimate at once the consequences of his misdeeds and the extent of his res ponsibilities.
('36', 43, 2, 4, 92348) The secret act has come out of the hiding place in which we thought it was confined.
('36', 43, 2, 5, 92433) Endowed in its own way with a kind of immaterial radio activity, it has run through all sections; all suffer from the fault of each, action, like the wavelets spreading from an eddy, makes itself felt in the most romote regions of the general social life.
('36', 43, 3, 6, 92689) Moral indiscipline at once dries up the fountains of the race, and hastens the wear and tear of the adults whom it debilitates both morally and physically.
('36', 43, 3, 7, 92845) Young India, 15 7 1926
('36', 43, 4, 8, 92868) 40. A GREAT PATRIOT
('36', 43, 5, 9, 92888) The unexpected and premature death of Umar Sobhani removes from our midst a patriot and worker of the front rank.
('36', 43, 5, 10, 93002) There was a time when Mr. Umar Sobhani’s word was law in Bombay.
('36', 43, 5, 11, 93067) There was not a public popular movement in Bombay in which, before misfortune overtook him, Umar Sobhani was not the man behind the scene.
('36', 43, 5, 12, 93206) He was no speaker.
('36', 43, 5, 13, 93225) He detested public speaking.
('36', 43, 5, 14, 93254) He never appeared on the stage.
('36', 43, 5, 15, 93286) He was the stage manager.
('36', 43, 5, 16, 93312) His popularity among fellow merchants was very great.
('36', 43, 5, 17, 93366) His judgment was as a rule sound and quick.
('36', 43, 5, 18, 93410) He was generous to a fault.
('36', 43, 5, 19, 93438) He distributed his charities among both the deserving and the undeserving.
('36', 43, 5, 20, 93513) There was hardly a popular movement that did not receive largely from his ample purse.
('36', 43, 5, 21, 93600) He spent as he earned.
('36', 43, 5, 22, 93623) Umar Sobhani was extreme in everything.
('36', 43, 5, 23, 93663) His extremism in speculation proved his economic ruin.
('36', 43, 5, 24, 93718) He doubled his wealth in a month and he became a pauper the next month.
('36', 43, 5, 25, 93790) He stood his losses bravely but his proud nature would not permit him to do public work when he lost his millions.
('36', 43, 5, 26, 93905) He would not accept the middle rank.
('36', 43, 5, 27, 93942) He would retire if he could not top the donation lists.
('36', 43, 5, 28, 93998) And so he disappeared from public life as soon as he became a poor man.
('36', 43, 5, 29, 94070) Whenever and wherever there is mention of public workers and public work, it would be impossible not to think of Umar Sobhani and his patriotic services.
('36', 43, 5, 30, 94224) His life is at once an inspiration and a warning to rich young men.
('36', 43, 5, 31, 94292) His zealous work as apatriot is an inspiration.
('36', 43, 5, 32, 94340) His life shows us that possession of riches is not inconsistent with that of abilities and their dedication to public
('36', 44, 0, 1, 94458) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 45
('36', 44, 1, 2, 94501) service.
('36', 44, 1, 3, 94510) It is a warning to rich young men who would be reckless in ambition.
('36', 44, 1, 4, 94579) Umar Sobhani was no stupid speculator.
('36', 44, 1, 5, 94618) Many lost when he lost.
('36', 44, 1, 6, 94642) There is perhaps nothing to be said against his great cotton purchases which brought him down.
('36', 44, 1, 7, 94737) But why did he speculate at all?
('36', 44, 1, 8, 94770) He was already a prince among merchants.
('36', 44, 1, 9, 94811) As a patriot, it was his duty to restrain his ambition.
('36', 44, 1, 10, 94867) His life and his name were a trust for the public.
('36', 44, 1, 11, 94918) And there was need for him to be extra cautious.
('36', 44, 1, 12, 94967) I know the maxim De Mortuis nil nisi bonum.
('36', 44, 1, 13, 95011) I know also that what I am saying is all wisdom after the event.
('36', 44, 1, 14, 95076) But I do not criticize to find fault.
('36', 44, 1, 15, 95114) I do so to profit by the lesson that this patriot’s life teaches us.
('36', 44, 1, 16, 95183) And wisdom after the event is a legitimate virtue for posterity to treasure.
('36', 44, 1, 17, 95260) We must learn even from one another’s errors.
('36', 44, 1, 18, 95306) We should all be as Umar Sobhani in burning love for the country, in giving well and much for it, if we have riches, in knowing no communal bias or distinction and we must also, if we will, learn to avoid his recklessness and thus deserve the heritage he has bequeathed to us.
('36', 44, 1, 19, 95583) I tender my condolences to his aged father and his family.

('36', 44, 5, 23, 95721) Non violence is the greatest force man has been endowed with.
('36', 44, 5, 24, 95783) Truth is the only goal he has.
('36', 44, 5, 25, 95814) For God is none other than Truth.
('36', 44, 5, 26, 95848) But Truth cannot be, never will be, reached except through non violence.
('36', 44, 5, 27, 95921) That which distinguishes man from all other animals is his capacity to be non violent.
('36', 44, 5, 28, 96008) And he fulfils his mission only to the extent that he is non violent and no more.
('36', 44, 5, 29, 96090) He has no doubt many other gifts.
('36', 44, 5, 30, 96124) But if they do not subserve the main purpose—the development of the spirit of non violence in him—they but drag him down lower than the brute, a status from which he has only just emerged.
('36', 44, 5, 31, 96313) The cry for peace will be a cry in the wilderness, so long as the spirit of non violence does not dominate millions of men and women.
('36', 44, 5, 32, 96447) An armed conflict between nations horrifies us.
('36', 44, 5, 33, 96495) But the economic war is no better than an armed conflict.
('36', 44, 5, 34, 96553) This is like a

('36', 45, 1, 3, 96755) An economic war is prolonged torture.
('36', 45, 1, 4, 96793) And its ravages are no less terrible than those depicted in the literature on war properly so called.
('36', 45, 1, 5, 96895) We think nothing of the other because we are used to its deadly effects.
('36', 45, 1, 6, 96968) Many of us in India shudder to see blood spilled.
('36', 45, 1, 7, 97018) Many of us resent cow slaughter, but we think nothing of the slow torture through which by our greed we put our people and cattle.
('36', 45, 1, 8, 97149) But because we are used to this lingering death, we think no more about it.
('36', 45, 1, 9, 97225) The movement against war is sound.
('36', 45, 1, 10, 97260) I pray for its success.
('36', 45, 1, 11, 97284) But I cannot help the gnawing fear that the movement will fail, if it does not touch the root of all evil—man’s greed.
('36', 45, 1, 12, 97403) Will America, England and the other great nations of the West continue to exploit the so called weaker or uncivilized races and hope to attain peace that the whole world is pining for?
('36', 45, 1, 13, 97588) Or will Americans continue to prey upon one another, have commercial rivalries and yet expect to dictate peace to the world?
('36', 45, 1, 14, 97713) Not till the spirit is changed can the form be altered.
('36', 45, 1, 15, 97769) The form is merely an expression of the spirit within.
('36', 45, 1, 16, 97824) We may succeed in seemingly altering the form but the alteration will be a mere make believe if the spirit within remains unalterable.
('36', 45, 1, 17, 97959) A whited sepulchre still conceals beneath it the rotting flesh and bone.
('36', 45, 1, 18, 98032) Far be it from me to discount or under rate the great effort that is being made in the West to kill the war spirit.
('36', 45, 1, 19, 98148) Mine is merely a word of caution as from a fellow seeker who has been striving in his own humble manner after the same thing, may be in a different way, no doubt on a much smaller scale.
('36', 45, 1, 20, 98335) But if the experiment demonstrably succeeds on the smaller field and, if those who are working on the larger field have not overtaken me, it will at least pave the way for a similar experiment on a large field.
('36', 45, 1, 21, 98546) I observe in the limited field in which I find myself, that unless I can reach the hearts of men and women, I am able to do nothing.
('36', 45, 1, 22, 98679) I observe further that so long as the spirit of hate persists in some shape or other, it is impossible to establish peace or to gain our freedom by peaceful effort.
('36', 45, 1, 23, 98844) We cannot love one another, if we hate English men.
('36', 45, 1, 24, 98896) We cannot love the Japanese and hate Englishmen.
('36', 45, 1, 25, 98945) We must either let the Law of Love rule us through and through or not at all.
('36', 45, 1, 26, 99023) Love among ourselves based on hatred of others breaksdown under the slightest pressure.
('36', 45, 1, 27, 99111) The fact is such love is never real love.
('36', 45, 1, 28, 99153) It is an armed peace.
('36', 45, 1, 29, 99175) And so it will be in this great movement in the West

('36', 46, 1, 3, 99284) War will only be stopped when the conscience of mankind has become sufficiently elevated to recognize the undisputed supremacy of the Law of Love in all the walks of life.
('36', 46, 1, 4, 99456) Some say this will never come to pass.
('36', 46, 1, 5, 99495) I shall retain the faith till the end of my earthly existence that it shall come to pass.

('36', 47, 3, 4, 100581) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter and the paper prepared by you.
('36', 47, 3, 5, 100644) Do you not read Young India?
('36', 47, 3, 6, 100673) It gives facts and figures showing the progress of khadi during the last five years.
('36', 47, 3, 7, 100758) If you will only take up your Young India file for the current year, you will find all figures there.
('36', 47, 3, 8, 100860) To collect all the statistics from the pages of Young India here would be to put an extra tax on the energies of those who have little time to spare from their daily labour.
('36', 47, 3, 9, 101034) The experiment that is being scientifically conducted in schools is the one in the 24 schools conducted under superintendence of Shrimati Anasuya Bai.
('36', 47, 3, 10, 101185) These schools have an attendance of 1600 boys and girls.
('36', 47, 3, 11, 101242) Spinning is all done by the takli.
('36', 47, 3, 12, 101277) Though all the teachers of the schools know spinning on the takli they are obliged to spin as well as the children.
('36', 47, 3, 13, 101393) A fixed time is set apart for spinning by them.
('36', 47, 3, 14, 101441) And the yarn so spun is turned out into khadi which in many cases is used by the children themselves.
('36', 47, 3, 15, 101543) Experience has taught us that takli is the best thing to be introduced in schools.
('36', 47, 3, 16, 101626) It is handy.
('36', 47, 3, 17, 101639) It does not go out of order.
('36', 47, 3, 18, 101668) It is cheap, occupies no room and thousands can spin at the same time; and, whilst the output per hour on a single takli is much less than on the spinning wheel, the collective result of takli spinning in schools is much greater than that of the spinning wheel for the simple reason that it is impossible to make all the boys to spin on the wheel at the same time.
('36', 47, 3, 19, 102033) There can only be a limited number of wheels supplied in a school.

('36', 48, 8, 18, 103141) 2 Forwarding a few lines on what struck him as a solution of the problem of Hindu Muslim unity, Salivateeswaran sought Gandhiji’s candid opinion about it as that would encourage him to study such problems and find out solutions.
('36', 48, 8, 19, 103370) 3 Writing on July 13, Horniman had urged Gandhiji to preside over a meeting on July 19 to honour the memory of Umar Sobhani (S.N. 10960).

('36', 49, 3, 5, 103814) I have written to the Vice Principal about the spindles.
('36', 49, 3, 6, 103871) They are not up to the standard.
('36', 49, 3, 7, 103904) If standard spindles can be made there, it will be a great relief.
('36', 49, 4, 8, 103971) I am glad you are introducing spinning there.
('36', 49, 4, 9, 104017) All your staff should learn to spin on takli.
('36', 49, 4, 10, 104063) No one can teach these boys better than they.
('36', 49, 4, 11, 104109) If you do require an instructor, write to Babu Brij Kishen, Krishna Nivas, Katra Khushal Rai, Delhi, and I am sure he will come and help you.
('36', 49, 4, 12, 104251) He is an enthusiast.
('36', 49, 4, 13, 104272) Probably you know him.
('36', 49, 4, 14, 104295) He is a very good man and he would gladly come for a few days.
('36', 49, 4, 15, 104358) Of course, you will insist upon the boys carding their own cotton and making their slivers.
('36', 49, 4, 16, 104450) Carding must go hand in hand with spinning.
('36', 49, 5, 17, 104494) You have asked me a question about food.
('36', 49, 5, 18, 104535) I think that the physiological results of food are a consequence and not a cause for the avoidance of animal food.
('36', 49, 5, 19, 104650) For, even if it could be proved that there is no physiological evil effect from taking animal food, it will still be banned on the principle of ahimsa.

('36', 52, 3, 4, 108237) MY DEAR CHILD, I have your letter.
('36', 52, 3, 5, 108272) Why must you enter into all the explanation in respect of Rs. 10/ ?
('36', 52, 3, 6, 108340) I would be grieved if you pinch yourself for sending me Rs. 10/ or anything.
('36', 52, 3, 7, 108417) As there was a question in the Ashram as to whether the money was received or not and whether, if it was received, it was mislaid, I told you about it.
('36', 52, 3, 8, 108569) But, it would please me better if you will keep the khaddar and not think of paying for it.

('36', 52, 3, 10, 108775) Nor need you hesitate to ask for more if you want more.
('36', 52, 3, 11, 108831) I am delighted to hear of the progress made by Nani 1. It would be an achievement if she speaks three languages equally well when she grows up.
('36', 52, 3, 12, 108975) I suppose, the strong will she inherits from her mother and gentleness from her father, or, will you say vice versa?
('36', 52, 3, 13, 109092) It is too early to think of what I shall do next year.
('36', 52, 3, 14, 109147) But, if I do come to the South, I would love to go to Porto Novo.

('36', 52, 9, 20, 109415) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('36', 52, 9, 21, 109448) I note what you say about your coming to the

('36', 53, 1, 2, 109560) Ashram.
('36', 53, 1, 3, 109568) In my opinion, the scheme you have sent me shows the academy to be a demi official institution.
('36', 53, 1, 4, 109664) But, really speaking, you should be best judge of what you should do.
('36', 53, 1, 5, 109734) In your place I would not join such [an] institution, however beneficial it may be.
('36', 53, 1, 6, 109818) The secret of our non co operation is to renounce the benefits of the system, which we need not receive.
('36', 53, 1, 7, 109923) Even of the benefits which we voluntarily receive, we picked out some when we embarked upon non co operation.
('36', 53, 1, 8, 110033) Educational institutions were one such thing.
('36', 53, 1, 9, 110079) But, in the present state of things, when non co operation is confined only to individuals every one must really decide for himself.
('36', 53, 1, 10, 110212) And, where his conscience does not prick, he should unhesitatingly give up non co operation.
('36', 53, 1, 11, 110305) If I could enthuse every single Swarajist to leave the Councils, I would exert all my influence in that direction and I know it will do a great deal of good.
('36', 53, 1, 12, 110463) Similarly, No changers who resume practice in courts or places in senates are no No changers.
('36', 53, 1, 13, 110557) But, I want you not to make of Non co operation a fetish.
('36', 53, 1, 14, 110615) Nor to depend upon a Fatwa from any authority however much you may esteem it.
('36', 53, 1, 15, 110693) Test every single action of yours on the anvil of your conscience and unhesitatingly adopt what your conscience approves of.

('36', 53, 5, 20, 110927) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI , July 16, 1926
('36', 53, 6, 21, 110965) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('36', 53, 6, 22, 110998) I have nothing like a guide that would tell you how to arrive at the required strength.
('36', 53, 6, 23, 111086) But the easiest method of testing the strength of the twist is to make your cone as you are spinning as tight as possible.
('36', 53, 6, 24, 111209) Now a tight core is an impossibility if the yarn so spun is not strong enough to bear the strain.
('36', 53, 6, 25, 111307) It is hardly necessary to count the revolutions.
('36', 53, 6, 26, 111356) After testing the yarn in the manner I have suggested, you will instinctively spin strong yarn.
('36', 54, 0, 1, 111452) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 55
('36', 54, 1, 2, 111495) doubt revolutions increase a spinner’s speed, not necessarily the strength of his yarn.
('36', 54, 1, 3, 111583) The strength depends upon the deliberation and the tension with which you draw the thread.
('36', 54, 1, 4, 111674) And the twist is given as it is drawn.
('36', 54, 1, 5, 111713) A final turn or two of the wheel finishes the twist, before you wind the yarn round the spindle.
('36', 54, 1, 6, 111810) The eye is the only guide to evenness.
('36', 54, 1, 7, 111849) Fineness depends upon the fineness of the spindle and the staple of cotton, as also the manner in which slivers are made.
('36', 54, 1, 8, 111971) As you are doing your spinning with scientific precision, I would suggest your learning carding.
('36', 54, 1, 9, 112068) Carding is, in my opinion, a fine occupation, though strenuous.
('36', 54, 1, 10, 112132) Your account of how you came to spin is deeply interesting.
('36', 54, 1, 11, 112192) Whatever your ulterior object, what prompts you to spin should be all suffering for everybody.
('36', 54, 1, 12, 112287) I am glad too that you appreciate the economic value of the spinning wheel for the dumb millions.
('36', 54, 1, 13, 112385) You will not hesitate to send me your yarn for testing whenever you feel inclined.
('36', 54, 2, 14, 112468) Yours sincerely, D. N. BAHADURJI, ESQ.

('36', 54, 5, 18, 112590) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, Friday, Asadha Sud 6, July 16, 1926
('36', 54, 6, 19, 112649) JAMNALAL, The land in the possession of Joshi Girijashanker which we had been thinking of acquiring must have been purchased today.
('36', 54, 6, 20, 112781) The total area is 19 vighas 1, from which he will retain one vigha at the extreme end.
('36', 54, 6, 21, 112868) Land measuring 18 vighas and the buildings will be bought for a total of Rs. 21,000. The owner or his tenant, whoever lives there, will be entitled to draw water from our well.
('36', 54, 6, 22, 113045) This right will cease if he sells that one vigha.
('36', 54, 6, 23, 113095) When he sells it, we shall have the right of pre emption

('36', 55, 0, 1, 113196) 56 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 55, 1, 2, 113237) at a price to be fixed by a panch 1. We have to pay Rs. 5,000 just now as guarantee money and shall have to pay the remaining 16,000 within one month.
('36', 55, 1, 3, 113388) The name of the person in whose name the land will be registered is not being entered [in the sale deed].
('36', 55, 1, 4, 113494) I can think of three possibilities: 1) in the name of the Ashram; 2) for cow protection activities; 3) in your name.
('36', 55, 1, 5, 113611) If you wish to buy it in your name, you may.
('36', 55, 1, 6, 113656) Personally, I am inclined to buy it in the name of the Ashram and use it, if necessary, for setting up a dairy or a tannery.
('36', 55, 1, 7, 113781) Alternatively, we may set up the dairy and the tannery on some other plot of the Ashram land and use this land for agriculture and residential buildings.
('36', 55, 1, 8, 113935) We are very much short of buildings just now.
('36', 55, 1, 9, 113981) Whatever the purpose for which we buy the land, you will have to arrange for the money there.
('36', 55, 1, 10, 114075) If necessary, you may also see Jugalkishorji and Ghanshya mdasji in this connection.
('36', 55, 1, 11, 114160) I think we shall have to start constructing a few more buildings as soon as the rains are over.
('36', 55, 1, 12, 114256) Please wire to me what is to be done about the money and in whose name the document should be registered.
('36', 55, 1, 13, 114362) We have had fine rains here.
('36', 55, 1, 14, 114391) The river is in flood almost every day.
('36', 55, 1, 15, 114431) The Hindu Muslim quarrel is growing there from day to day.
('36', 55, 1, 16, 114490) Try if you can discover the cause.

('36', 55, 4, 20, 114639) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, Friday, July 16, 1926
('36', 55, 5, 21, 114684) BHAISHRI MOHANLAL PANDYA, I have your letter.
('36', 55, 5, 22, 114730) Have you been to Sunav, or are you yet to visit it?
('36', 55, 5, 23, 114782) I showed your letter to Vallabhai.
('36', 55, 5, 24, 114817) He did not know what he could do.
('36', 55, 5, 25, 114851) I am glad that you wrote about the potters.
('36', 55, 5, 26, 114895) We can do two things just now, though we have lost our old enthusiasm.
('36', 55, 5, 27, 114966) One, we can teach potters to have a sense of fairness and to be independent minded.
('36', 55, 5, 28, 115050) Since they do not render forced labour any longer, they should expect no favours.
('36', 55, 5, 29, 115132) They should not have supplied the earth when asked by a private individual.
('36', 55, 5, 30, 115208) I think he could ask, as a matter of
('36', 55, 6, 31, 115245) 1 Arbitrator or board of arbitrators

('36', 56, 1, 2, 115325) right, to be supplied earth only for the purpose of making tiles.
('36', 56, 1, 3, 115391) In this matter, therefore, the potters should fully preserve their self respect.
('36', 56, 1, 4, 115472) They should be educated to preserve their self respect.
('36', 56, 1, 5, 115528) I think it is necessary for them to take permission to dig for earth.
('36', 56, 1, 6, 115598) If any person could dig anywhere, field after field would be ruined.
('36', 56, 1, 7, 115667) Secondly, we should not look upon officials as our enemies.
('36', 56, 1, 8, 115727) We should not shrink from discussing matters with them as friends.
('36', 56, 1, 9, 115794) I see no harm in trying to reason with them when rank injustice is being done.
('36', 56, 1, 10, 115873) Even if we wish to resort to satyagraha, our first step should be to reason with them.
('36', 56, 1, 11, 115960) Moreover, the poor potters are surely not non co operators.
('36', 56, 1, 12, 116020) There is nothing wrong, therefore, in approaching officials to discuss matters with them on their behalf.
('36', 56, 1, 13, 116126) Not only so, it may even be our moral duty to some extent and in certain circumst ances to try to reason with them.
('36', 56, 1, 14, 116242) Think over all this and do what you think best.

('36', 56, 5, 19, 116452) I look upon all scriptures as the inspired speech of holy men, and regard the Koran, too, in the same light.
('36', 56, 5, 20, 116561) I try to understand the spirit of every religious book without clinging to the literal meaning of its words.
('36', 56, 5, 21, 116670) I look upon Hazarat Mahomed as one among several prophets.
('36', 56, 5, 22, 116729) I should like to see a guru who was actually alive today.
('36', 56, 5, 23, 116787) I have no means of knowing with certainty that my ideas are always good.
('36', 56, 5, 24, 116860) I am but a humble creature taking every step with fear in my heart.
('36', 56, 5, 25, 116928) I certainly do not believe that my life will have been wasted if I do not come across a guru before I die.
('36', 56, 5, 26, 117035) My duty is to work; the fruit is in God’s hands to give, I am not looking for a guru in order that he may resolve my doubts.
('36', 56, 5, 27, 117160) I welcome being the slave of a good man because it would make me happy.
('36', 56, 5, 28, 117232) The whole country is not against the spinning wheel, and even if it were I would cling to it so long as my inner voice told me that I should.

('36', 57, 9, 23, 118427) As a matter of fact, when I took this resolution in the presence of Mrs. Naidu, Punditji and other friends, I rehearsed the circumstances which could be interpreted to mean unforeseen, and I equally said to myself that meetings of condolences about departed friends should not draw me out of my

('36', 58, 1, 5, 119279) A meeting held to honour his memory needs no support from me to become successful.

('36', 58, 13, 22, 120014) I have your letter.
('36', 58, 13, 23, 120034) I think we shall have to do without getting the document registered.
('36', 58, 13, 24, 120103) The things which they want to be omitted are essential aspects of our work and we cannot at all leave them out, for the words in question are part of the congress resolution.
('36', 58, 13, 25, 120278) All the same, I am of the view that the meaning which Bhulabhai and others read is not correct.

('36', 59, 1, 3, 120663) I cannot then understand why a body which is a part of the Congress and is mainly engaged in philanthropic work cannot be registered.
('36', 59, 1, 4, 120797) But Can we ever hope to convince Government officials with arguments?
('36', 59, 1, 5, 120867) Shri Narandas saw me, too, yesterday about the problem of the office.
('36', 59, 1, 6, 120937) His argument was that almost all the expendi ture being incurred now was so much waste of money.
('36', 59, 1, 7, 121034) But we need not at all be in a hurry when only four or five days are left now.
('36', 59, 1, 8, 121113) We will discuss the matter at leisure and decide.
('36', 59, 1, 9, 121163) There was another telegram, followed by a letter, from Horniman about a public meeting in connection with Sobhani 3. I am again replying “No”.
('36', 59, 1, 10, 121306) I was having a headache for the past two or three days.

('36', 59, 5, 17, 121629) The chief things by way of preparation for living in the Ashram are cultivating simplicity in food and dress, cultivating a liking for physical labour, spinning regularly every day, learning to card, and making an earnest effort to follow truth and non violence and observe brahmacharya, etc.
('36', 59, 5, 18, 121922) One should not feel disgust even in cleaning a latrine, but regard it as one’s dharma to do so.

('36', 60, 1, 2, 122175) 63. A DIFFICULT QUESTION
('36', 60, 2, 3, 122200) A teacher asks: 1
('36', 60, 3, 4, 122218) I venture to answer this question because I am myself a sort of teacher and because I have carried out, and am still carrying out, several experiments in that field.
('36', 60, 3, 5, 122384) This question has been raised by a fellow teacher.
('36', 60, 3, 6, 122435) This and similar other questions have been pending with me for a long time now.
('36', 60, 3, 7, 122515) The friend in question does not insist on the reply being given through Navajivan.
('36', 60, 3, 8, 122598) Considering, however, that a number of teachers seek help from me in solving such difficulties, and some of them may find guidance from my ideas on this subject, I have thought it fit to answer it through Navajivan.
('36', 60, 4, 9, 122814) Personally, I believe in the Puranas as sacred books and also in gods and goddesses.
('36', 60, 4, 10, 122899) But I do not believe in them in the same way as the interpreters of the Puranas do and want others to do.
('36', 60, 4, 11, 123005) I know too that I do not believe in them as society in general does at present.
('36', 60, 4, 12, 123085) I do not believe that gods like Indra, Varuna, and others reside in the sky and that they are separate individuals, or even that goddesses like Saraswati and others are separate entities.
('36', 60, 4, 13, 123273) But I certainly believe that gods and goddesses represent the various powers.
('36', 60, 4, 14, 123351) Their descriptions are sheer poetry.
('36', 60, 4, 15, 123388) There is a place for poetry in religion.
('36', 60, 4, 16, 123429) The Hindu religion has lent to everything that we believe in a scriptural form.
('36', 60, 4, 17, 123509) In a way, all those who believe that God has innumerable powers may be said to believe in gods and goddesses.
('36', 60, 4, 18, 123619) Just as God has innumerable powers, He has innumerable forms also.
('36', 60, 4, 19, 123686) One should worship Him by the name and in the form one likes.
('36', 60, 4, 20, 123748) I do not think there is anything wrong in that.
('36', 60, 4, 21, 123796) Whenever and wherever necessary, the symbols and metaphors may be explained and their inner meaning made clear to the children.
('36', 60, 4, 22, 123924) I for one would not feel any hesitation in doing so.
('36', 60, 4, 23, 123977) I have not known any harmful result flowing from this.
('36', 60, 4, 24, 124032) I would certainly not lead the children in any wrong direction.
('36', 60, 4, 25, 124096) I find no difficulty in accepting that the Himalayas are God Siva and that the Ganga, in the form of Parvati, rises and flows from his matted hair.
('36', 60, 4, 26, 124244) Not only that, these ideas strengthen my belief in God and it enables
('36', 60, 5, 27, 124314) 1 The questions are not translated here.
('36', 60, 5, 28, 124355) They are related to the symbolism behind the Puranic stories of gods and goddesses and the attitude which teachers should adopt in regard to these legends.
('36', 61, 0, 1, 124511) 62 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 61, 1, 2, 124552) me to understand better that everything is pervaded by God.
('36', 61, 1, 3, 124612) One may interpret stories like the churning of the ocean and so on in the way one likes.
('36', 61, 1, 4, 124701) Care should, however, be taken to see that the interpretation offered helps in inculcating good morals and noble conduct.
('36', 61, 1, 5, 124823) Scholars have indeed offered such interpretations according to their intelli gence.
('36', 61, 1, 6, 124907) But it is not to be supposed that these are the only interpreta tions possible.
('36', 61, 1, 7, 124987) Just as there is a process of development in man, even so there is a process of development in the meaning of words and sentences.
('36', 61, 1, 8, 125118) As our intelligence and heart develop, the meaning of words and sentences must also develop and so it does.
('36', 61, 1, 9, 125226) Where people limit the meaning within narrow confines and build walls all round, it cannot but decay and deteriorate.
('36', 61, 1, 10, 125344) The meaning and its interpreter both develop together.
('36', 61, 1, 11, 125399) And everybody will continue, according to his feeling, to draw his own meaning.
('36', 61, 1, 12, 125479) Those whose minds are impure will see in the Bhagavata the delineation of promiscuity, while it was only a vision of the atman alone that Ekanath could get out of it.
('36', 61, 1, 13, 125646) I firmly believe that the author of the Bhagavata did not write it to encourage promiscuity.
('36', 61, 1, 14, 125739) But if those of the present day find in it anything repugnant to their moral sense, they should certainly reject it.
('36', 61, 1, 15, 125856) To believe that all that is in print—especially if it is in Sanskrit—is true religion is nothing but blind superstition or stupidity.
('36', 61, 1, 16, 125990) Therefore, I know but one golden rule by which to solve this problem and I place it before teachers: We must reject everything—be it in the Vedas, the Puranas, or any other religious book—that is in our view inconsistent with truth, or is likely to encourage vice.
('36', 61, 1, 17, 126255) I may mention here an experience that I had while in jail.
('36', 61, 1, 18, 126314) I had often heard people praising the Gita Govinda of Jayadeva.
('36', 61, 1, 19, 126378) I wished to read it some day.
('36', 61, 1, 20, 126408) This poem might have provided enjoyment to many, but for me its reading proved a torture.
('36', 61, 1, 21, 126498) I did read it but its description pained me.
('36', 61, 1, 22, 126543) I would not at all hesitate to admit that the fault might have been entirely mine.
('36', 61, 1, 23, 126626) But I have stated my position merely for the satisfaction of the reader.
('36', 61, 1, 24, 126699) Since the Gita Govinda did not produce a good effect on my mind, it became unreadable for me and I could reject it because I had my own independent standard to go by in such circumstances.
('36', 61, 1, 25, 126888) Only those things are to be deemed religiously instructive which make for the elimination of evil thoughts and for the lessening of passions like hatred, only those things whose study would make one stick to truth even when mounting the gallows.
('36', 61, 1, 26, 127134) The Gita Govinda did not pass this test and therefore it became for me a book to be rejected.
('36', 62, 0, 1, 127228) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 63
('36', 62, 1, 2, 127271) There are today amongst us a number of youths and even old people who think that a thing is worth doing merely because it has been laid down in the Shastras.
('36', 62, 1, 3, 127429) This will easily lead to our moral degradation.
('36', 62, 1, 4, 127477) We do not even know what exactly can be called the Shastras.
('36', 62, 1, 5, 127538) If we believe that whatever goes on in the name of the Shastras is dharma and carry on accordingly, it is bound to lead to undesirable results.
('36', 62, 1, 6, 127682) Take Manusmriti only, for example, I do not know which of its verses are genuine and which are interpolations.
('36', 62, 1, 7, 127793) But there are quite a few which cannot be defended as religious in their import.
('36', 62, 1, 8, 127874) We must reject such verses.
('36', 62, 1, 9, 127902) I am a great admirer of Tulsidas.
('36', 62, 1, 10, 127936) And I consider the Ramayana to be the greatest work.
('36', 62, 1, 11, 127989) But I cannot subscribe to the idea contained in the couplet: “The drum, the village fool, the Sudras, animals, women—all these are fit to be beaten.” Because Tulsidas, influenced by the ideas prevalent in his time, has expressed this view, it would not be just for me to take to beating the so called Sudras or my wife or even the animals whenever I find them not submitting to my control.
('36', 62, 1, 12, 128379) Now I think that the answer to the question raised above becomes clear.
('36', 62, 1, 13, 128451) I do not see the slightest difficulty in narrating the story of the gods and goddesses to the extent that it helps in promoting good conduct.
('36', 62, 1, 14, 128593) I do not say that if the symbol is laid bare and the inner meaning brought out, the children lose interest in the stories.
('36', 62, 1, 15, 128716) Assuming, however, that they do lose interest, I cannot approve of the practice of sustaining interest at the cost of truth.
('36', 62, 1, 16, 128841) We should place before children whatever rasa there is in truth.
('36', 62, 1, 17, 128906) It is my experience that this rasa can be expressed and communicated.
('36', 62, 1, 18, 128976) First the children must be told clearly that there has never yet been in the world a ten headed demon and that there is no possibility of one occurring hereafter.
('36', 62, 1, 19, 129139) When this has been made clear, it will be no repudiation of truth or loss of interest if we narrate the story of Ravana as if he really did once exist.
('36', 62, 1, 20, 129291) The children do understand that the ten headed monster Ravana is no other than the evil desires inside us which have not only ten but a thousand heads.
('36', 62, 1, 21, 129443) In Aesop’s Fables birds and animals speak.
('36', 62, 1, 22, 129486) The children know that birds and animals cannot speak and yet their delight in his stories is not one whit the less on that account.

('36', 63, 1, 2, 129697) 64. QUALITY AND STRENGTH OF YARN
('36', 63, 2, 3, 129730) I have stated before that just as, in respect of yarn count we have progressed from three to eighty, and in respect of spinning speed from 200 yards to 800 yards an hour, and are also better now at preparing skeins of the yarn spun, so it is essential to improve the strength and texture of the yarn.
('36', 63, 2, 4, 130031) With improvement in yarn strength and texture, weaving would become easier and, therefore, cheaper.
('36', 63, 2, 5, 130131) We must improve in these respects so far, at any rate, that weavers will buy hand spun as readily as they buy mill made yarn.
('36', 63, 2, 6, 130257) Our ideal should be to make hand spun yarn more even in texture and more durable than mill yarn.
('36', 63, 2, 7, 130354) With this end in view experiments are at present being carried out in Gujarat to improve the quality of yarn, and in quite a short time some of us have achieved near perfection in regard to both texture and strength.
('36', 63, 3, 8, 130571) I have received figures regarding the quality of yarn from eight institutions producing khadi with aid from the Gujarat Khadi Pracharak Mandal.
('36', 63, 3, 9, 130715) The yarn received by the Mandal was from voluntary spinners who spin in the spirit of a yajna.
('36', 63, 3, 10, 130810) 1 I have with me a statement showing the quality of yarn contributed by 71 persons belonging to Kathlal, Nadiad, Dharmaj, Bhadran, Napad, Varad, Sarbhon and Ahmedabad.
('36', 63, 3, 11, 130978) All of them seem to have used slivers made from cotton carded with a big carding bow.
('36', 63, 3, 12, 131064) The varieties of cotton used were vankad, goji, deshi of Nadiad, Bardoli and Surati.
('36', 63, 3, 13, 131149) The highest level attained by any of the samples in respect of strength was found to be 52_ degrees.
('36', 63, 3, 14, 131250) Some fell to as low a figure as 15, and the highest average figure in this respect was that of Ahmedabad, 42. None of the 71 spinners reached a figure higher than 52_.
('36', 63, 3, 15, 131418) Most of them, in fact, are below 40. This degree of strength is very low.
('36', 63, 3, 16, 131492) It is very difficult to weave yarn of less than 50 degrees in strength.
('36', 63, 3, 17, 131564) Sixty degrees should be the minimum, and 70 should be regarded as normal.
('36', 63, 3, 18, 131638) The average in respect of texture comes to 42_, and the maximum goes up to 50, which is nearly the highest possible.
('36', 63, 3, 19, 131755) This degree of evenness of texture is quite good.
('36', 63, 3, 20, 131805) The lowest figure for texture was found to be 13, which is low indeed.
('36', 63, 3, 21, 131876) It should never fall below 40, for it is extremely difficult to weave yarn of that degree of texture, indifferently thick and thin.
('36', 63, 3, 22, 132008) Only rope can be made out of such yarn.
('36', 63, 4, 23, 132048) 1 Vide “A Correction,” 1 8 1926.
('36', 64, 0, 1, 132081) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 65
('36', 64, 1, 2, 132124) The experiment carried out in Gujarat has resulted in the strength of yarn reaching the figure 104, which is higher than that of the strongest mill yarn.
('36', 64, 1, 3, 132278) The details of this experiment will be published in a short time.
('36', 64, 1, 4, 132344) Meanwhile, however, all those doing sacrificial spinning should remember that it is essential to pay great attention to improving the quality of yarn.
('36', 64, 1, 5, 132495) Anyone who is anxious to effect such improvement must keep two things in mind.
('36', 64, 1, 6, 132574) In the first place, one should not at present think of rejoining the broken thread.
('36', 64, 1, 7, 132658) When both the hands work in unison, the thread will never break; in any case, it is essential, if the quality of yarn is to improve, that the broken thread should be removed.
('36', 64, 1, 8, 132833) If the hank is rolled tight, the strength of the yarn will be known, because the stretching of the yarn in tight rolling necessarily tests the strength of the yarn.
('36', 64, 1, 9, 132998) If the thread breaks while stretching, it may be assumed that it has not been well twisted.
('36', 64, 1, 10, 133090) The yarn wound on the reel should never be removed from it without first blowing water spray on it.
('36', 64, 1, 11, 133190) After the spraying it should be allowed to dry, so that the moisture is absorbed by the yarn and strengthens it.
('36', 64, 1, 12, 133303) This blowing moistens every fibre in the thread.
('36', 64, 1, 13, 133352) Uneven spraying will not serve the purpose.
('36', 64, 1, 14, 133396) The yarn should be properly moistened.
('36', 64, 1, 15, 133435) Perhaps the best way of ensuring this is to wind the yarn on a separate reel and dip the latter into water and let it remain in water till the yarn is moistened, that is, for two or three minutes.
('36', 64, 1, 16, 133632) Anyone who can think of other easier methods may certainly try them.
('36', 64, 1, 17, 133701) The main point which I have explained should, however, be borne in mind.
('36', 64, 1, 18, 133774) I hope that no one will at any rate try the experiment of removing the yarn from the reel and dipping it into water, for if the yarn is removed from the reel without being sprayed, it may become looser in twist, and the loss cannot be repaired by blowing water spray into the yarn afterwards.
('36', 64, 1, 19, 134067) The blowing is intended to make the twist strong enough so that it will last, and this can be done only by doing the blowing while the yarn is on the reel.
('36', 64, 1, 20, 134223) Finally, let all those who do sacrificial spinning remember that on their efficiency depends improvement in the quality of yarn spun by others who work for wages and that improvement in the quality of their yarn will mean increased earnings for these others.

('36', 65, 2, 3, 134570) STOCKING OF COTTON IN PANCHTALAVADA
('36', 65, 3, 4, 134606) Sarvashri Chhaganlal and Maneklal are working in Panchtal avada on behalf of the Kathiawar Political Conference.
('36', 65, 3, 5, 134719) They have sent the following account of the work done: Their work is spread over 32 villages, in which 745 maunds of cotton was stocked.
('36', 65, 3, 6, 134856) Out of this, 216 maunds of cotton was ginned by hand and 529 in the factories.
('36', 65, 3, 7, 134935) From this, 2681 vejans 1 of cloth was woven, that is, 53,620 yards of khadi was produced: Even now a subsidy of Rs. 20 had to be given.
('36', 65, 3, 8, 135071) Many of them worked efficiently and economically and did not need help.
('36', 65, 3, 9, 135143) Apart from this, 2,588 yards of khadi was produced from yarn spun and woven for payment.
('36', 65, 3, 10, 135232) The quantity of cotton mentioned above was stocked by 640 families.
('36', 65, 3, 11, 135300) The stocking of this gave work to 20 carders and 100 weavers.
('36', 65, 3, 12, 135362) The carders received about Rs. 1,200 and the weavers Rs. 4,000. The sums were paid by the cultivators them selves.
('36', 65, 3, 13, 135477) Out of the 640 families, only seven 2 families availed themselves of the help provided.
('36', 65, 3, 14, 135565) Commenting on this, the two workers say that the success of our work depends on inducing cultivators to stock cotton, for in this way we get a real idea of thepoverty of our country.
('36', 65, 3, 15, 135748) We realize, they say, that our real work lies in villages, and that while doing this work we can also do other social work among the villagers.
('36', 65, 3, 16, 135892) By popularizing the use of the spinning wheel we can convince people what a terrible disease their idleness is.
('36', 65, 3, 17, 136004) Wherever the volunteers work in a spirit of service, they succeed in creating a sense of brotherhood among the people.
('36', 65, 3, 18, 136123) And the difficulty of selling khadi, they point out, is avoided by following the method of getting people to stock their own cotton [and produce khadi for their needs].
('36', 65, 3, 19, 136292) Apart from this work of persuading people to stock cotton, these brothers got 100 women to work for wages.
('36', 65, 3, 20, 136399) The rate of payment was 6 pies per count.
('36', 65, 3, 21, 136441) Each woman earned between Rs. 2 8 as.
('36', 65, 3, 22, 136479) per mound and Rs. 3 a month.
('36', 65, 3, 23, 136508) They spun yarn of 4 to 8 counts.
('36', 65, 3, 24, 136541) Two carders worked for supplying the slivers required by these women.
('36', 65, 3, 25, 136611) Twenty weavers were at work weaving the yarn produced.
('36', 65, 3, 26, 136666) The rate of payment for carding was Rs. 2 10 as.
('36', 65, 3, 27, 136715) per maund.
('36', 65, 3, 28, 136726) The weavers were paid Rs. 8 per maund of khadi of between 24 and 27 inches in width and Rs. 10 per maund for khadi of 30 inches width.
('36', 65, 3, 29, 136861) They were paid

('36', 66, 1, 2, 137025) Rs. 12 1 for one maund of turban cloth of 16 inches width, the length of each piece being about 10 yards.
('36', 66, 1, 3, 137131) Thus Rs. 185 8 0 were spent on weaving and Rs. 65 4 0 on carding, Rs. 232 8 0 on weaving and Rs. 4 0 0 on ginning, the total being Rs. 487 4 0.

('36', 66, 5, 7, 137341) Monday, July [19] 2, 1926
('36', 66, 6, 8, 137367) JAMNALAL, I got your telegram, and so am addressing this letter to you at Banaras.
('36', 66, 6, 9, 137450) I wrote a letter last week and addressed it to you at Calcutta.
('36', 66, 6, 10, 137514) We have purchased Girjashanker Joshi’s land for Rs. 21,000. We shall have to spend another Rs. 1,000 on miscellaneous items.
('36', 66, 6, 11, 137639) The total area of the land is 19 vighas, out of which the owner will keep one vigha for himself.
('36', 66, 6, 12, 137736) We have paid Rs. 5,000 as earnest money.
('36', 66, 6, 13, 137777) We have to pay the balance of Rs. 16,000 within a month.
('36', 66, 6, 14, 137834) The question now is, in whose name should we get the land registered?
('36', 66, 6, 15, 137904) In your name, or that of the Ashram, or of an institution for cow protection?

('36', 67, 8, 14, 139542) You should learn carding too.

('36', 67, 8, 16, 139592) There is no counting my weaknesses.
('36', 67, 8, 17, 139628) Yes, I may say that there was a time when I was pleased by public honour.
('36', 67, 8, 18, 139702) There have been more occasions than one in my life when I was overcome with desire in the presence of a woman other than my wife.
('36', 67, 8, 19, 139832) There is only one way to keep the mind free from evil thoughts.
('36', 67, 8, 20, 139896) We should cry and pray to God for help so that we may have only good thoughts.
('36', 67, 8, 21, 139975) Do you cry any time when praying for things?

('36', 68, 2, 3, 140285) THE ASHRAM, Monday, July 19, 1926
('36', 68, 3, 4, 140319) BHAI NANABHAI, Your letter is an exercise for me.
('36', 68, 3, 5, 140369) Narahari has quoted to you from Shri Mahadev’s reply to his letter.
('36', 68, 3, 6, 140437) Narahari had said that neither pupils nor parents cared for our education and that by and by all of them would join Government schools, that they did not seem keen on wearing khadi or enthusiastic about our aims.
('36', 68, 3, 7, 140650) My reply to this argument was that, if in any school pupils refused to abide by our rules, they should leave it.
('36', 68, 3, 8, 140763) The rules include wearing of khadi, observance of the practice of untouchability, etc.
('36', 68, 3, 9, 140850) I had these circumstances in mind when I asked Mahadev to write and say that Narahari had remained in Surat of his own free will.
('36', 68, 3, 10, 140980) I had askedfor his services for only three or four months.
('36', 68, 3, 11, 141039) I know Narahari’s unsteady nature.
('36', 68, 3, 12, 141074) Following the principle that one’s own sphere of work, though small, is good for one’s spiritual development, I said that Sarbhon 1 was the right place for him, but that, if he preferred, he could remain in Surat.
('36', 68, 3, 13, 141288) After this, my responsibility was over.
('36', 68, 3, 14, 141328) I do not order, I only advise.
('36', 68, 3, 15, 141359) I have left it to you to order.
('36', 68, 3, 16, 141391) I explained what I would do if I were a teacher.
('36', 68, 3, 17, 141440) Others may follow that course and do the best they can, or do nothing if they can do no more.
('36', 68, 3, 18, 141534) I have done my duty in offering the bride to the groom at the wedding; it is none of my business to run the house for her.
('36', 68, 3, 19, 141657) As the bride’s father, however, I may certainly advise her from time to time.
('36', 68, 3, 20, 141735) But I have understood the difference between your point of view and mine.
('36', 68, 3, 21, 141809) You believe in national education plus khadi, etc.
('36', 68, 3, 22, 141860) I say that national education itself means khadi and the other things.
('36', 68, 3, 23, 141931) This is for the first time that you have mentioned this difference.
('36', 68, 3, 24, 141999) What you understand by national education, apart from these three things, you may explain to me when you are here.
('36', 68, 3, 25, 142114) Or you may write to me about it.
('36', 68, 3, 26, 142147) I would not adopt the method of the missionaries nor that which is supposed to be followed in Islam.
('36', 68, 3, 27, 142248) Our religion teaches me a third way.
('36', 68, 3, 28, 142285) I would show the article I offered and state its price, leaving it to the people to buy it at that price.
('36', 68, 3, 29, 142391) This course decides the question of fitness, and the foundation remains firmly that of truth.
('36', 68, 3, 30, 142485) The measure of my right angle does not vary according to circumstances;

('36', 69, 1, 2, 142665) if, however, people cannot fit themselves in it, the fault is not mine, nor with the right angle nor with those people.
('36', 69, 1, 3, 142785) But all this is neither here nor there.
('36', 69, 1, 4, 142825) Consider my views, but decide for yourself and act accordingly.
('36', 69, 1, 5, 142889) If Narahari wishes, he can remain in Surat.
('36', 69, 1, 6, 142933) You may insist on khadi to the limit you and he think best.
('36', 69, 1, 7, 142993) My views will remain what they are, till you can change them.
('36', 69, 1, 8, 143055) Mama is wonderful.
('36', 69, 1, 9, 143074) Write and explain to him that in a sense the issue is, and in a sense it is not, one between agriculture and other work.
('36', 69, 1, 10, 143195) I can have no prejudice against agriculture.
('36', 69, 1, 11, 143240) But I do not look upon agriculture as a necessary part of our service of the Antyajas, and so I cannot but feel when even one pice has to be spent on agriculture, since in spending it we leave our sphere of work.

('36', 70, 2, 3, 144150) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, July 20, 1926
('36', 70, 3, 4, 144187) DEAR FRIEND, I have the spinning wheel and your bill.
('36', 70, 3, 5, 144241) In accordance with the terms of my first letter to you, asking for the charkha, I shall have to return it.
('36', 70, 3, 6, 144348) But, before I do so, I want to give you my views upon it so as not to do you an injustice.
('36', 70, 3, 7, 144439) The charkha is a flimsy thing.
('36', 70, 3, 8, 144470) The woodwork is all right, but the wire spokes and the wire stays are perfectly useless because they are not of steel.
('36', 70, 3, 9, 144589) The wires easily bend under the slightest pressure whereas, in the Khadi Charkha, they are all steel wires.
('36', 70, 3, 10, 144697) The axle does not lie evenly on the poles.
('36', 70, 3, 11, 144740) The result is that the wheel string stays not in the centre, but on one side of the wheel.
('36', 70, 3, 12, 144831) The spindle isperfectly useless, because instead of sloping away from one end, it is a straight pointed wire on either end.
('36', 70, 3, 13, 144955) You cannot spin on it easily.
('36', 70, 3, 14, 144985) The pulley is perfectly useless.
('36', 70, 3, 15, 145018) There is no handle rod provided.
('36', 70, 3, 16, 145051) The spinning wheel, therefore, that you have sent me is not only not superior to the Khadi Pratishthan [one] as you claimed, but it is altogether inferior to it.
('36', 70, 3, 17, 145213) I had sent for your charkha in order to test its quality, because the price you quoted was surprisingly low.
('36', 70, 3, 18, 145322) The price of the Khadi Pratishthan Charkha was fixed in consultation with me after much deliberation and after arriving at the net cost.
('36', 70, 3, 19, 145459) You have no notion how much it costs when the details about fittings are to be made scrupulously correct as they are in the Khadi Pratishthan Charkha.
('36', 70, 3, 20, 145610) Every part is tested before it is sent out.
('36', 70, 3, 21, 145654) It is evident to me that you do not yourself handle spinning wheels, one could be easily deceived by a superficial similarity.
('36', 70, 3, 22, 145781) You will now tell me what to do with your charkha.
('36', 70, 3, 23, 145832) I do not want you to be out of pocket by a single pice.
('36', 70, 3, 24, 145888) I will, therefore, gladly send the charkha back to you.
('36', 70, 3, 25, 145944) But if you want me to send it somewhere else, I shall gladly do so at my cost.
('36', 70, 3, 26, 146023) Or, if you want me to try this charkha in any other manner, I would gladly do so.
('36', 70, 3, 27, 146105) And, if it can at all prove satisfactory, I should keep it and discharge your bill.

('36', 71, 3, 4, 146376) MY DEAR SIR HAROLD MANN, I thank you for your letter 1 inviting me to demonstrate hand spinning at the forthcoming exhibition in Poona.
('36', 71, 3, 5, 146512) I should love to do so, but for two reasons.
('36', 71, 3, 6, 146557) Up to the 20th of December, I am under avow not to leave Ahmedabad except upon some pressing unforeseen public call or for reasons of health.
('36', 71, 3, 7, 146699) Secondly, I want to move slowly and, therefore, I do not want to identity myself so much with functions which, though they may be unofficial, may have an official colouring or patronage.
('36', 71, 3, 8, 146886) It is more truthful for me to do so so long as I suspect the existing system as an evil.
('36', 71, 3, 9, 146975) I know I can write thus freely and frankly to you without being considered in any way discourteous.
('36', 71, 3, 10, 147075) You will find, however, that the party of demonstrators that will be sent to you will be thoroughly effective and the demonstration itself will be given in a scientific manner.
('36', 71, 3, 11, 147252) Because we are experimen ting upon this in a scientific manner, not one of the principal workers has 2 any preconceived notions or prejudice one way or the other.
('36', 71, 3, 12, 147415) It is because we feel that the charkha is the one thing that can save the sinking peasantry from extinction that we are devoting all our energy to its improvement and success.
('36', 71, 3, 13, 147591) I have been brooding over the Dairy scheme that you have kindly sent me.
('36', 71, 3, 14, 147664) There seems to be no land near Ahmedabad that I can get, but if you could send the expert you have in view, he will see the land near the Ashram that we have got and, if he thinks that a Dairy could be established here on an unambitious scale, a portion of the land can be set apart for the purpose.
('36', 71, 3, 15, 147964) And, if that proves unsatisfac tory, I must confer with him about securing a plot of land some distance from Ahmedabad.
('36', 71, 3, 16, 148084) I am running a little Dairy here myself.
('36', 71, 3, 17, 148125) Perhaps, it may be extended.
('36', 71, 3, 18, 148154) Nothing, however, can be done without a personal conversation with one who knows all about dairying.

('36', 73, 12, 18, 150717) I was reading up your article on the coming conference in South Africa for Young India yesterday and I felt that the article was not well considered.
('36', 73, 12, 19, 150867) You have evidently felt it yourself and so, in order to tone down the impression left on your readers, you have added six lines in your own hand.

('36', 74, 1, 3, 151297) If it was the whole truth, Round Table Conference would be no remedyfor it.
('36', 74, 1, 4, 151373) We must then, whilst there is yet time, clear every Indian from South Africa.
('36', 74, 1, 5, 151451) It is due to the whites and it is due to ourselves.
('36', 74, 1, 6, 151503) If the sayings that you have quoted of two Europeans are the typical and almost universal sentiment amongst the average white man in South Africa, is it right to resist that sentiment?
('36', 74, 1, 7, 151688) Can the Government, no matter how powerful it may be, do otherwise than pass progressively drastic legislation?
('36', 74, 1, 8, 151800) The sentiment may be altogether bad.
('36', 74, 1, 9, 151837) But, can a man overcome his prejudice?
('36', 74, 1, 10, 151876) And, if the average.
('36', 74, 1, 11, 151897) white man in South Africa, more especially in Natal as you say, has that prejudice, isn’t it the duty of those like you and me who want to serve truth before anything else to face that fact squarely in the face and pave the way for a dignified and honourable withdrawal of every single Indian from South Africa?
('36', 74, 1, 12, 152209) If I was convinced, as you are convinced, of this colour prejudice, I would certainly advocate withdrawal even if mine was the only voice.
('36', 74, 1, 13, 152348) But, of course, I do not share your conclusions.
('36', 74, 1, 14, 152397) In the first instance, I do not regard human nature in South Africa to be so badly debased.
('36', 74, 1, 15, 152489) I think that the prejudice is very much mixed.
('36', 74, 1, 16, 152536) As a matter of fact, if the prejudice was as great as you imagine, the Europeans would make it so hot for Indians that they could not possibly live there for a single minute.
('36', 74, 1, 17, 152711) No legislation would be needed for that purpose.
('36', 74, 1, 18, 152760) Remember that even now Indian trade is dependent upon European patronage.
('36', 74, 1, 19, 152834) The colour prejudice is no doubt universal in social life.
('36', 74, 1, 20, 152893) That is a barrier which time alone will break.
('36', 74, 1, 21, 152940) No legislation is necessary for breaking that barrier.
('36', 74, 1, 22, 152995) For that matter that barrier is far worse, perhaps, here than in South Africa.
('36', 74, 1, 23, 153074) But I do not want to carry the argument any further.
('36', 74, 1, 24, 153127) All I want to say is you should put a curb upon your pen, for, anything you write must have and has its effect.
('36', 74, 1, 25, 153239) This article of yours is so terrible.
('36', 74, 1, 26, 153277) I return it to you so that you can refresh your memory.
('36', 74, 1, 27, 153333) If I am wrong, you will correct me.
('36', 74, 1, 28, 153369) I have suppressed also the article you sent me on ‘Opium’; That article was too hurriedly written to be of any value.
('36', 74, 1, 29, 153487) It was too scrappy, did not even give sufficient information.
('36', 74, 1, 30, 153549) But both these articles indicate extreme fatigue of mind.
('36', 74, 1, 31, 153607) Will you not restrain yourself a bit, or, do you think that it is God’s call that your pen must be ever running?
('36', 74, 1, 32, 153720) Gregg has summed up this writing disease of yours in one single line.
('36', 74, 1, 33, 153790) He says, ‘The insect bite poisoning was a godsend for you, because, it obliged you to put away your pen.’ Anyway, I absolve you from all obligation to write for Young India till you have

('36', 75, 1, 2, 154018) had some rest.
('36', 75, 1, 3, 154033) And, if you want such discharge from the other newspapers, I undertake to procure it for you.
('36', 75, 1, 4, 154127) And I give you my assurance that the world will not go to pieces for the suspension of your writings, because, there is hardly a paper I am opening in which I do not see long articles from you on the same subject.
('36', 75, 1, 5, 154341) If they cannot exist without you, let them die.
('36', 75, 1, 6, 154389) I feel grieved to find that you must be continually writing when there is no necessity for it.
('36', 75, 1, 7, 154484) With deep love.

('36', 75, 6, 13, 154633) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter with prospectus.
('36', 75, 6, 14, 154682) The object of the syndicate seems to me to be only to buy out the oil seeds.
('36', 75, 6, 15, 154759) It is not stated anywhere who are the promoters of this effort, who has laid out funds for the initial cost.
('36', 75, 6, 16, 154868) Unless I have more accurate information, it is not possible for me to express any opinion.

('36', 75, 9, 22, 155125) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, Tuesday, Asadha Sud 10, July 20, 1926
('36', 75, 10, 23, 155186) BHAISHRI PARAMANAND, I have your letter.
('36', 75, 10, 24, 155227) I understand your point about the use of
('36', 76, 0, 1, 155268) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 77
('36', 76, 1, 2, 155311) words and am well aware of the value of precision.
('36', 76, 1, 3, 155362) The use of the same word in different senses leads to a good deal of misunder standing, but I think it is not difficult to understand the general purport of my writings.
('36', 76, 1, 4, 155532) In regard to Madhuri, you are to blame.
('36', 76, 1, 5, 155572) Having placed our children in a certain atmosphere, is it not surprising indeed that we believe or wish that they will remain untouched by it?
('36', 76, 1, 6, 155715) I come across instances of this everywhere.
('36', 76, 1, 7, 155759) You should now remove Madhuri and place her in an atmosphere of simplicity, if you do not wish her to become fashion loving.
('36', 76, 1, 8, 155884) But to keep her where she is and then insist that she should not wear foreign cloth has a strong smell of coercion about it.
('36', 76, 1, 9, 156009) On the issue of principle which you have raised in connection with Madhuri, my view is that parents should exercise control over children.
('36', 76, 1, 10, 156148) We cannot let them do everything they will.
('36', 76, 1, 11, 156192) Our wisdom lies in keeping them under control with the least restraint over them.
('36', 76, 1, 12, 156274) If a child runs in the direction of a well, or wants to eat a rich and stimulating preparation or would indulge in overeating, if it asks for bhajiyan 1 and puri 2 when it is running a temperature—in all such instances we should resist the child’s wish.
('36', 76, 1, 13, 156528) This is also true about matters involving moral principles.
('36', 76, 1, 14, 156588) But the problem of husband and wife is on a different footing, and an extremely difficult one to solve.
('36', 76, 1, 15, 156692) What happens when, in a non vegetarian family, the husband becomes a vegetarian as a matter of religious principle?
('36', 76, 1, 16, 156808) Should the wife follow, against her will, what the husband has accepted as his dharma?
('36', 76, 1, 17, 156895) I think that the husband, if he has overcome his lust, should maintain an attitude of detachment and even help the wife to have her non vegetarian food.
('36', 76, 1, 18, 157048) If the wife cannot go out to buy such food for herself and if the husband, though still not free from lust, has given up meat eating, etc., as a matter of religious principle, the latter may, because he has not been able to impose discipline over himself in regard to the first matter, cut offrelations with his wife and provide her with money to enable her to live apart from him.
('36', 76, 1, 19, 157430) If she wants to marry some other person belonging to their own religion, the husband should not oppose her but, on the contrary, help her.
('36', 76, 1, 20, 157569) This is what my creed of non violence suggests to me.
('36', 76, 1, 21, 157623) Such a course of action will satisfy many principles
('36', 76, 2, 22, 157676) 1 Fried preparations 2 ibid
('36', 77, 0, 1, 157704) 78 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 77, 1, 2, 157745) simultaneously, but we can deduce all of them from the principle of non violence.
('36', 77, 1, 3, 157827) It is now easy to see how a husband, who has adopted khadi as a matter of religious principle, should act towards his wife who does not follow him.
('36', 77, 1, 4, 157975) This is not the end of the matter, though.
('36', 77, 1, 5, 158018) In Hindu society, the husband is regarded as his wife’s friend, and also as her teacher and guardian.
('36', 77, 1, 6, 158120) If he understands his duty in that capacity, his duty as a husband which I have explained above will have to be modified somewhat.
('36', 77, 1, 7, 158251) But I need not enter into a discussion of that.
('36', 77, 3, 8, 158299) I have put the matter so briefly here that I should not like public use to be made of this letter.

('36', 77, 6, 12, 158527) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, July 21, 1926
('36', 77, 7, 13, 158564) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('36', 77, 7, 14, 158597) 1 What I said on my release from prison is embedded in a signed document of which I send you a copy.
('36', 77, 7, 15, 158698) 2 Ihad indeed flattered myself with the hope that my release from prison would bring about unity.
('36', 77, 7, 16, 158796) But my hope was dashed to pieces.
('36', 77, 7, 17, 158830) Whilst I
('36', 77, 8, 18, 158839) 1 Riza had referred in his letter of June 30 to reports in the English Press of sanguinary Hindu Muslim conflicts in India.
('36', 77, 8, 19, 158963) “I have also noticed that the commence ment of these feuds synchronises with your imprisonment, and I had hoped that with your restoration to liberty, these unfortunate conflicts would come to a stop.
('36', 77, 8, 20, 159164) They are however still continuing undeterred.” 2 Riza had further observed: “On your release, the papers in this country accredited you with an opinion, which they avowed you made in public, that the feelings were so high between the two factions that the only solution would be a pitched battle between the two which could exhaust their anger and settle their minds.
('36', 77, 8, 21, 159532) I trust this statement imputed to you is not entirely true” (S.N. 11074).
('36', 77, 8, 22, 159606) The “signed document” is the “Letter to Mahomed Ali”, 7 2 1924, which Gandhiji had intended to be “a message to his countrymen on his release”.

('36', 78, 1, 2, 159793) quite agree with you that the fault lies with us, I have not a shadow of a doubt that the foreign power takes advantage of our weaknesses and trades upon them.
('36', 78, 1, 3, 159953) You ask me to do something.
('36', 78, 1, 4, 159981) I am doing all I possibly can.
('36', 78, 1, 5, 160012) But I feel my utter helplessness and worthlessness.
('36', 78, 1, 6, 160064) The remedy that I have is not acceptable to either party.
('36', 78, 1, 7, 160122) I am, therefore, watching, waiting and praying.
('36', 78, 1, 8, 160170) I have no doubt that some day better counsels will prevail.

('36', 78, 4, 13, 160352) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, July 21, 1926
('36', 78, 5, 14, 160389) MY DEAR GOVIND, I have your letter.
('36', 78, 5, 15, 160425) If I was a believer in miracles, I would say that my not going to Finland was a miracle.
('36', 78, 5, 16, 160514) I had actually dictated a letter and telegram of final acceptance and the mere accident of my having gone to the ‘Library’ and a flash light perception altered the whole situation within five minutes.
('36', 78, 5, 17, 160715) I am certainly eager to go to China if I find the way clearly open, but not for the reasons you mention.
('36', 78, 5, 18, 160820) I do not believe in imported credit and, therefore, I do not think that my way in India will be smoother if the Chinese accepted it; nor am I in any way hopeful of their acceptance.
('36', 78, 5, 19, 161002) What attracts me to China is identity of status in that both are nations under foreign domination.
('36', 78, 5, 20, 161101) I came in very intimate contact with the Chinese colony in the Transvaal.
('36', 78, 5, 21, 161175) And, as a matter of fact, I believe that whilst I would have readily got in Finland intellectual assent to the doctrine of ahimsa, I shall find it terribly difficult to secure that assent from the Chinese, whether cultured or uncultured.
('36', 78, 5, 22, 161413) But that does not worry me as it does not worry me here whether people accept ahimsa or not, What I am afraid of about Europe and America is patronage.
('36', 78, 5, 23, 161565) I entertain no such fear about China.
('36', 78, 5, 24, 161603) You will detect here in me a subtle pride and, if you do, you will not be far wrong.
('36', 78, 5, 25, 161688) But there it is.
('36', 78, 5, 26, 161705) I think that some friend did send me the book called The Arm of
('36', 79, 0, 1, 161769) 80 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 79, 1, 2, 161810) I do not think I read it carefully.
('36', 79, 1, 3, 161846) But, since you think so highly about it, I shall ask our librarian to search it out and give it to me.
('36', 79, 1, 4, 161949) By all means put into shape your economic arguments about khaddar before you write on ahimsa.
('36', 79, 1, 5, 162043) 1 Whenever you send me questions, I shall try to deal with them.
('36', 79, 1, 6, 162108) I must not stir out of Sabarmati at the present moment.
('36', 79, 1, 7, 162164) I am keeping well.
('36', 79, 1, 8, 162183) I am trying the experiment of living on fruit alone.
('36', 79, 1, 9, 162236) This is the 9th day.
('36', 79, 1, 10, 162257) I am not feeling weak.
('36', 79, 1, 11, 162280) I do not expect to be able to retain my strength indefinitely on fruit alone.
('36', 79, 1, 12, 162358) I have commenced the experiment to avoid constipation.
('36', 79, 1, 13, 162413) I am continuing it for pleasure.
('36', 79, 1, 14, 162446) I should love to drop milk any time.
('36', 79, 1, 15, 162483) My food just now is grapes and mangoes.
('36', 79, 1, 16, 162523) Please tell Sundaram I have got his beautiful weekly gift and tell him not to worry if he miss a week.
('36', 79, 1, 17, 162626) With love to you all.

('36', 79, 6, 25, 162914) I thought I had replied to it.
('36', 79, 6, 26, 162945) I had nothing to say about what you did.
('36', 79, 6, 27, 162986) Whatever help you can give to it cannot but have my approval.
('36', 79, 6, 28, 163048) I can say with confidence that those who are in charge of the khadi activity in Bengal have been conducting it with selflessness, sincerity and dexterity.
('36', 79, 6, 29, 163203) I send with this an account of all the sums spent in Bengal through the All India Spinners’ Association.
('36', 79, 6, 30, 163308) I gather from newspapers that Hindu Muslim dissensions are spreading there day by day, but I no longer feel shocked by such news and my faith remains unshaken that out of this very state of things will come a day,

('36', 80, 4, 8, 163994) The best policy at the present time seems to be to keep aloof from all parties.
('36', 80, 4, 9, 164074) I was pained, but not surprised, by the bitter experience in regard to the emigrants section.
('36', 80, 4, 10, 164168) I simply cannot regret having undertaken such an experiment.
('36', 80, 4, 11, 164229) We can gain no experience without experimenting and every moment I feel the truth of the remark of mine which you have quoted.
('36', 80, 4, 12, 164356) You are also rightwhen you say that officials of the Congress should not be blamed for the failure of this section.

('36', 81, 1, 2, 164950) whereas medicine is the least part of the business.
('36', 81, 1, 3, 165002) Illness is caused by violation of rules of diet, exercise, rest, etc.
('36', 81, 1, 4, 165072) Being careful about health means cheerfully observing these rules, and braking them is to be guilty of extreme lethargy.
('36', 81, 1, 5, 165193) Explain this to her.
('36', 81, 1, 6, 165214) I look upon Hindu Muslim riots as a kind of surgical operation.
('36', 81, 1, 7, 165278) It would have been excellent if we could have avoided it, but evidently we have been suffering from inflammation of this particular limb and the condition was no longer curable by bandaging the part.
('36', 81, 1, 8, 165478) When this rioting is over, one day we shall certainly become united.
('36', 81, 1, 9, 165547) And if this society is much too decayed to last, let it perish.
('36', 81, 1, 10, 165611) In any case the present condition is not worse than the profound darkness in which it was slumbering.

('36', 81, 6, 15, 165894) RESPECTED REVASHANKERBHAI, I have your letter.
('36', 81, 6, 16, 165941) It is quite necessary to be firm with Ratilal 1. I have already let him know that he will not get a single pie unless he gives an account of the money spent.
('36', 81, 6, 17, 166099) We should get the Doctor’s figure directly.
('36', 81, 6, 18, 166143) I have written to Champa 2, too, about the extravagant spending but she has not replied.
('36', 81, 6, 19, 166232) I am awaiting her arrival here.
('36', 81, 6, 20, 166264) The day before yesterday, Punjabhai 3 felt giddy and fainted.
('36', 81, 6, 21, 166326) He is not in a condition now to go anywhere.
('36', 81, 6, 22, 166371) It seems you have written to him asking him to go there in connection with the affairs of the firm of Chhaganlal Mansukhlal.
('36', 81, 6, 23, 166496) I think it would be best not to trouble him about that matter any further.
('36', 81, 6, 24, 166571) He wants you to solve the problem as best as you can there, and to me also that seems the right course.
('36', 81, 6, 25, 166675) It is clear that you should go to a cool place every summer.

('36', 82, 1, 2, 166960) 85. LETTER TO PRABHUDAS BHIKHABHAI
('36', 82, 2, 3, 166995) SABARMATI, July 21, 1926
('36', 82, 3, 4, 167020) DEAR SHRI PRABHUDAS BHIKHABHAI, I have your letter.
('36', 82, 3, 5, 167072) I believe it is possible to conserve the vital fluid by learning to control one’s breath, but that does not solve the problem of brahmacharya.
('36', 82, 3, 6, 167215) Brahmacharya means control of all the senses.
('36', 82, 3, 7, 167261) Perhaps you do not know that medical scientists in this ageperform a surgical operation which prevents the emission of the vital fluid; would you call a person so operated upon a brahmachari?
('36', 82, 3, 8, 167453) A shastri explained to me the meaning of conservation of the vital fluid, and said that in Sanskrit the phrase viryanigraha has reference to the sublimation of the vital fluid so that it flows upwards.
('36', 82, 3, 9, 167655) And then he told me that Krishna whose doings are described by the author of the Bhagavata was a person in whom the vital fluid was sublimated in this manner, and so he was free to have relations with any number of women.
('36', 82, 3, 10, 167877) Are you prepared to look upon such a person as a brahma chari?
('36', 82, 3, 11, 167940) You will now see that the brahmacharya achieved through mere breath control is of little value.
('36', 82, 3, 12, 168036) The real value of brahmacharya lies in the expenditure of the great energy required for mastering the senses; when, through such expenditure, the senses become atman oriented, the power which is generated by the effort can pervade the entire universe.
('36', 82, 3, 13, 168288) It is my unshakable conviction that such cannot be achieved by methods of purely external control.
('36', 82, 3, 14, 168387) In the second chapter [of the Gita] 1, Shri Krishna, who had the wisdom of experience, says that fasting may calm a man’s desires, but that his pleasure in objects of the senses does not disappear completely.
('36', 82, 3, 15, 168596) It disappears only when he has realized God, and he will have to strive during life after life before he realizes God.
('36', 82, 3, 16, 168715) Remember what Shankaracharya said in this connection.
('36', 82, 3, 17, 168769) If a man, sitting on the shore, attempts the impossible task of emptying the sea by taking out the water drop by drop, on a blade of grass, he may, if he has the necessary patience and if he can find an empty hollow large enough, succeed in transferring the water after millions Of years the number of which can be calculated arithmetically; to realize God requires more patience than this, and, according to the Lord, achieving brahma charya means realizing God.
('36', 82, 3, 18, 169233) Please understand that in saying all this I
('36', 83, 0, 1, 169277) 84 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 83, 1, 2, 169318) am not at all underestimating the value of breath control.
('36', 83, 1, 3, 169377) I believe it to be an aid in our effort, but by itself it is not enough.
('36', 83, 1, 4, 169450) It can be a stage, and not a very advanced one at that, in the difficult journey towards the goal of brahmacharya.
('36', 83, 1, 5, 169565) My only complaint against you is that you seem to attach more importance to it than it deserves.

('36', 83, 6, 10, 169775) The following is a condensation of a speech 1 delivered by Mr. Malcolm Muggeridge of Union Christian College, Alwaye, and sent to me for publication.
('36', 83, 6, 11, 169925) The speech is useful as showing the growing national consciousness among Christian Indians.
('36', 83, 6, 12, 170017) The wonder is that the process has been so long delayed.
('36', 83, 6, 13, 170074) How any man of religion can help being in sympathy with the strivings of his nearest neighbours passes comprehension.
('36', 83, 6, 14, 170192) Internationalism presupposes nationalism—not the narrow, selfish, greedy spirit that often passes under the name of nationalism, but the nationalism that, whilst it insists upon its own freedom and growth, will disdain to attain them at the expense of other nations.

('36', 83, 8, 16, 170482) 87. THAT ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE
('36', 83, 9, 17, 170514) So it has been announced that the forthcoming Conference on the position of Indians in South Africa is to take place in Cape Town and that a Commission from South Africa is likely to visit India in order to study Indian conditions.
('36', 83, 9, 18, 170746) The Commission is to include Dr. Malan the present Secretary for the Interior and Mr. Duncan an ex Secretary.
('36', 83, 9, 19, 170856) This is all to the good.
('36', 83, 9, 20, 170881) It is good that the Conference is to take place in South Africa.
('36', 83, 9, 21, 170946) The Union Government being a wholly responsible government must have in all its undertakings the backing of public opinion in a sense in
('36', 83, 10, 22, 171083) 1 Not reproduced here
('36', 84, 0, 1, 171105) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 85
('36', 84, 1, 2, 171148) which the Indian Government has never felt itself under the necessity of having.
('36', 84, 1, 3, 171229) Moreover no public opinion needs to be created in India in favour of the Indian claim.
('36', 84, 1, 4, 171316) It is there already.
('36', 84, 1, 5, 171337) In South Africa, too much cannot be done to educate European opinion on the absolute justice of the Indian claim.
('36', 84, 1, 6, 171451) If, therefore, the Union Government means well and the selection of Indian representatives is wisely made, apart from the value of its deliberations, the Conference can be a means of directing European opinion in the right channel.
('36', 84, 1, 7, 171683) It is well also that a Commission from South Africa is to visit India.
('36', 84, 1, 8, 171754) It will gather impressions which only a personal visit canmake.
('36', 84, 1, 9, 171818) No amount of reading literature or meeting representatives can possibly make up for local inspection and seeing the people themselves face to face.
('36', 84, 2, 10, 171966) It is well also that the Commission is to include top men who are supposed to have studied the question.
('36', 84, 2, 11, 172071) Our case is so just that the more it is studied, the better it is for us.
('36', 84, 2, 12, 172145) We have nothing to lose by the closest examination and the widest publicity.
('36', 84, 2, 13, 172222) The more South Africans visit us, the better for us.
('36', 84, 2, 14, 172275) The greatest stumbling block in the way of a settlement is the ignorance, on the Indian question, of the best among South Africans.
('36', 84, 2, 15, 172407) They merely know the demand of the interested white traders.
('36', 84, 2, 16, 172468) They know little of the Indian side.
('36', 84, 2, 17, 172505) If the Conference results in a serious study of the question, the bogey of an Indian invasion or even the competition of those Indians who are already settled there will disappear in a moment.
('36', 84, 3, 18, 172698) There is the other side to the picture.
('36', 84, 3, 19, 172738) General Hertzog’s speeches are disturbing.
('36', 84, 3, 20, 172781) I do not conceive the possibility of justice being done to Indians, if none is rendered to the natives of the soil.
('36', 84, 3, 21, 172897) The mentality is the same in respect of Indians as of the natives.
('36', 84, 3, 22, 172964) Indeed, it is much worse regarding Indians.
('36', 84, 3, 23, 173008) Natives, it is said, have a claim upon the consideration of the whites; Indians are mere interlopers.
('36', 84, 3, 24, 173110) Of course, it is forgotten that Indians were enticed in the first instance to go to South Africa to labour for the Whites and that they were promised permanent settlement under advantageous terms.
('36', 84, 3, 25, 173307) The point, however, just now is not what they were promised, but what is the mentality of the Whites towards the Indian settlers.
('36', 84, 3, 26, 173437) And it being one of greater hostility towards them, justice to them is not to be expected if injustice is done to the Natives.
('36', 84, 3, 27, 173564) To reduce it to the lowest terms, the wish to see justice done to the Natives is based upon selfish considerations.
('36', 84, 3, 28, 173680) If we go a little deeper, we shall discover that justice
('36', 85, 0, 1, 173737) 86 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 85, 1, 2, 173778) can never be purchased at the expense of another.
('36', 85, 1, 3, 173828) When the seer prayed ‘may all people be happy’, he intuitively perceived a scientific truth.

('36', 85, 3, 5, 173944) 88. ‘TOWARDS MORAL BANKRUPTCY’–IV
('36', 85, 4, 6, 173978) Having dealt with the indiscipline of morals and its aggravation by the use of contraceptives and its terrible results, the author 1
('36', 85, 5, 7, 174111) proceeds to examine the remedies.
('36', 85, 5, 8, 174145) I must pass over the portions that deal with legislative measures, their necessity and yet utter inefficiency.
('36', 85, 5, 9, 174256) He then discusses the necessity, by a careful education of public opinion of the duty of chastity for the married, the duty of marriage for that vast mass of mankind that cannot for ever restrain their animal passions, the duty, having once married, of conjugal fidelity and the duty of continence in marriage.
('36', 85, 5, 10, 174567) He examines the argument against chastity that its
('36', 85, 6, 11, 174618) precept is against the physiological nature of man and woman and injurious to the happy equilibrium of their health.
('36', 85, 6, 12, 174735) that it is
('36', 85, 7, 13, 174746) an intolerable attack on the freedom and autonomy of the individual, his right to happiness and to live his life is his own way.
('36', 85, 7, 14, 174875) The author contests the doctrine that ‘the organ of generation is like the rest’ requiring satisfaction.
('36', 85, 7, 15, 174980) He says,
('36', 85, 8, 16, 174989) If it were an organ like the others, how could we explain the absolute inhibitory power which the will possesses over it?
('36', 85, 8, 17, 175111) Or the fact that the awakening of sensuality, which pharisaism calls the sexual necessity, is the result of the innumerable excitements which our civilization provides for young boys and girls several years before normal adult age?
('36', 85, 8, 18, 175343) I cannot resist the temptation of copying the following valuable medical testimony collected in the book in support of the proposition that self restraint is not only not harmful but necessary for the promotion of health and perfectly possible:
('36', 85, 9, 19, 175588) “The sexual instinct,” says Esterlen, professor at Tubigen University, “is not so blindly all powerful that it cannot be controlled, and even subjugated entirely, by moral strength and reason.
('36', 85, 9, 20, 175781) The young man, like the young woman, should learn to control himself until the proper time.
('36', 85, 9, 21, 175873) He must

('36', 86, 1, 2, 175936) know that robust health and ever renewed vigour will be the reward of this voluntary sacrifice.
('36', 86, 2, 3, 176032) “One cannot repeat too often that abstinence and the most absolute purity are perfectly compatible with the laws of physiology and morality, and that sexual indulgence is no more justified by physiology and psychology than by morality and religion.”
('36', 86, 3, 4, 176282) “The example of the best and noblest among men,” says Sir Lionel Beale, professor at the Royal College in London, “has at times proved that the most imperious of instincts can be effectively resisted by a strong and serious will, and by sufficient care as to manner of life and occupation.
('36', 86, 3, 5, 176572) Sexual abstinence has never yet hurt any man when it has been observed, not only through exterior restrictive causes” but as a voluntary rule of conduct.
('36', 86, 3, 6, 176726) Virginity, in fine, is not too hard to observe” provided that it is the physical expression of a certain state of mind.
('36', 86, 3, 7, 176846) Chastity implies not only continence, but also purity of sentiments, the energy which is the result of deep convictions.”
('36', 86, 4, 8, 176968) “Every kind of nervous activity,” says the Swiss psychologist Forel, who discusses sexual anomalies with a moderation equal to his knowledge, “is increased and strengthened by exercise.
('36', 86, 4, 9, 177154) On the other hand, inactivity in a particular region reduces the effects of the exciting causes which correspond to it.
('36', 86, 5, 10, 177274) “All causes of sexual disturbance increase the intensity of desire.
('36', 86, 5, 11, 177342) By avoiding these provocations it becomes less sensitive” and the desire gradually diminishes.
('36', 86, 5, 12, 177437) The idea is current among young people that continence is something abnormal and impossible, and yet the many who observe it prove that chastity can be practised without prejudice to the health .”
('36', 86, 6, 13, 177634) “I know,” says Ribbing, “a number of men of 25, 30, and older than that, who have observed perfect continence, or who when they married had done so up to that time.
('36', 86, 6, 14, 177799) Such cases are not rare; only they don’t advertise themselves.
('36', 86, 7, 15, 177862) “I have received many confidences from students, healthy both in body and mind” who have remonstrated with me for not having sufficiently insisted on the ease with which sensual desires can be ruled.”
('36', 86, 8, 16, 178063) “Before marriage, absolute continence can and ought to be observed by young men,” says Dr. Acton.
('36', 86, 8, 17, 178161) “Chastity no more injures the body than the soul,” declares Sir James Paget, Physician to the English Court; “Discipline is better than any other line of conduct.”
('36', 86, 9, 18, 178325) “It is a singularly false notion,” writes Dr. E. Perier, “and one which
('36', 87, 0, 1, 178397) 88 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 87, 1, 2, 178438) must be fought against, since it besets not only the children’s mind, but that of the fathers as well: the notion of imaginary dangers in absolute continence.
('36', 87, 1, 3, 178597) Virginity is a physical, moral, and intellectual safeguard to young men.”
('36', 87, 2, 4, 178671) “Continence,” says Sir Andrew Clarke, “does no harm, it does not hinder development, it increases energy and enlivens perception.Incontinence weakens self control, creates habits of slackness, dulls and degrades the whole being, and lays it open to diseases which can be transmitted to several generations.
('36', 87, 2, 5, 178978) To say that incontinence is necessary to the health of young men is not only an error, but a cruelty.
('36', 87, 2, 6, 179080) It is at once false and hurtful.”
('36', 87, 3, 7, 179114) “The evils of incontinence are well known and undisputed,” writes Dr. Surbled: “those produced by continence are imaginary; what proves this is the fact of the many learned and voluminous works devoted to the explanation of the former, while the latter still await their historian.
('36', 87, 3, 8, 179396) As to these latter there are but vague assertions, which hide themselves, for very shame, in mere talk, but which will not endure the daylight.”
('36', 87, 4, 9, 179541) “I have never seen,” writes Dr. Montegazza in La Physiologie de l’amour, “a disease produced by chastity....
('36', 87, 4, 10, 179650) All men, and especially young
('36', 87, 5, 11, 179680) men, can experience the immediate benefits of chastity.”
('36', 87, 6, 12, 179737) Dr. Dubois, the famous professor of neuropathology at Berne, affirms that “there are more victims of neurasthenia among those who give free rein to their sensuality than among those who know how to escape from the yoke of mere animalism”; and his witness is fully confirmed by that of Dr. Fere, Physician at the Bicetre Hospital, who testifies that those who are capable of psychic chastity can maintain their continence without any fear of their health, which does not depend on the satisfaction of the sexual instinct.
('36', 87, 7, 13, 180258) “ There has been unfitting and light talk,” writes Professor Alfred Fournier, “about the dangers of continence for the young men.
('36', 87, 7, 14, 180388) I can assure you that if these dangers exist I know nothing about them, and that as a physician I am still without proof of their existence, though I have had every opportunity in the way of subjects under my professional observation.
('36', 87, 8, 15, 180623) “Besides this, as physiologist I will add that true virility is not attained before the age of twenty one, or thereabouts, and the sexual necessity does not obtrude itself before that period, especially if unhealthy excitements have not aroused it prematurely.
('36', 87, 8, 16, 180884) Sexual precocity is merely artificial, and is most often the result of ill directed upbringing.
('36', 87, 9, 17, 180980) “In any case, be sure that danger of this kind lies far less in restraining than in anticipating the natural tendency; you know what I mean.”
('36', 87, 10, 18, 181122) Lastly, after these most authoritative testimonies, to which it be easy
('36', 88, 0, 1, 181194) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 89
('36', 88, 1, 2, 181237) to add many others, let us quote the resolution unanimously voted at Brussels in 1902 by the 102 members present at the second General Congress of the International Conference of Sanitary and Moral Prophylaxis, a congress which assembled together the most competent authorities on the subject throughout the world: “Young men must above all be taught that chastity and continence are not only not harmful, but also that these virtues are among those to be most earnestly recommended from the purely medical and hygienic standpoint.”
('36', 88, 2, 3, 181770) There was also a unanimous declaration issued by the professors of the Medical Faculty of Christian University, a few years ago: “The assertion that a chaste life will be prejudicial to the health rests, according to our unanimous experience” on no foundation.
('36', 88, 2, 4, 182031) We have no knowledge of any harm resulting from a pure and moral life.”
('36', 88, 3, 5, 182103) The case has, therefore, been heard, and sociologists and moralists can repeat with M. Ruysen this elementary and physiological truth, “that the sexual appetite does not need, like the requirements of aliment and exercise, a minimum of necessary satisfaction.
('36', 88, 3, 6, 182363) It is a fact that man or woman can lead a chaste life without experiencing, except in the case of a few abnormal subjects, serious disturbance or even painful inconvenience.
('36', 88, 3, 7, 182537) It has been said and cannot be too often repeated, since such an elementary truth can be so widely disregarded—that no disease ever comes through continence to normal subjects, who form the immense majority while many diseases, very well known and very serious, are the results of incontinence.
('36', 88, 3, 8, 182832) Nature has provided in the most simple and infallible way for the excess of nutrition which is represented by the seminal fluid and the menstrual flux.”
('36', 88, 4, 9, 182985) Dr. Viry is therefore right in denying that the question is one of a true instinct or a real need: “Everyone knows what it would cost him not to satisfy the need of nourishment or to suppress respiration, but no one quotes any pathological consequences, either acute or chronic, as having followed either temporary or absolute continence.
('36', 88, 4, 10, 183324) In normal life we see the example of chaste men who are neither less virile in character, nor less energetic in will, nor less robust, than others, nor less fitted to become fathers if they marry.
('36', 88, 4, 11, 183521) A need which can be subject to such variations, an instinct which accommodates itself so well to lack of satisfaction, is neither a need nor an instinct.”
('36', 88, 5, 12, 183676) Sexual relationship is far from answering to any physiological need of the growing boy; quite the contrary, it is perfect chastity which is sternly required by the exigencies of his normal growth and development, and those who violate it cause irreparable injury to their health.
('36', 88, 5, 13, 183956) The attainment of
('36', 89, 0, 1, 183974) 90 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 89, 1, 2, 184015) puberty is accompanied by great changes, a veritable disturbance of various functions, and a general development.
('36', 89, 1, 3, 184129) The adolescent boy needs all his vital strength, for during this period there is often a weakening of the resistance to sickness: disease and mortality are higher than in the earlier period .
('36', 89, 1, 4, 184321) The long work of general growth” of organic evolution, that whole series of physical and psychic changes, at the end of which the child becomes a man, involves a toilsome effort of nature.
('36', 89, 1, 5, 184510) At that moment, all over driving is dangerous, but especially the premature exercise of the sexual function.

('36', 89, 3, 8, 184670) The Cochin Legislative Council passed a resolution last year recommending introduction of hand spinning in the State schools.
('36', 89, 3, 9, 184796) The resolution was carried and accepted by the Government.
('36', 89, 3, 10, 184855) But, so far, evidently, nothing seems to have been done by the Education Department.
('36', 89, 3, 11, 184940) I understand that this resolution will be the subject matter of discussion in the forthcoming session of the Cochin Legislative Council.
('36', 89, 3, 12, 185077) It is to be hoped that some practical action will be taken upon the resolution or the resolution be rescinded.
('36', 89, 3, 13, 185188) It is no use Legislative bodies passing resolutions and Governments accepting them if they are not meant to be carried out.
('36', 89, 3, 14, 185312) Hand spinning is one of those things which require constant and continuous effort, watching, organizing and experimenting.
('36', 89, 3, 15, 185435) And those who introduce a hand spinning resolution have to shape policy, suggest schemes and even assist in working them.
('36', 89, 3, 16, 185557) Cochin, it seems, has 2 colleges, 35 high schools, 78 lower secondary schools, 369 State or State aided primary schools, 289 unaided schools, 20 industrial schools, 13 night schools and 4 special schools instructing 1,08,150 boys and girls.
('36', 89, 3, 17, 185798) Here there is much scope for popularizing spinning on a systematic scale.

('36', 89, 5, 19, 185895) 90. LETTER TO NORMAN LEYS THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, July 23, 1926
('36', 89, 6, 20, 185958) DEAR FRIEND, I am obliged to you for your letter.
('36', 89, 6, 21, 186008) 1 I would like you hence forward not to apologize for anything that you may say.
('36', 89, 7, 22, 186089) 1 For the text of this letter dated June 29, 1926, vide Appendix “Letter to Norman Leys”, 29 6 1926.
('36', 90, 0, 1, 186190) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 91
('36', 90, 1, 2, 186233) you my assurance that I shall not misunderstand you.
('36', 90, 2, 3, 186286) The proof you have sent me I had in book form from some friend in London.
('36', 90, 2, 4, 186360) It is a good and well reasoned paper.
('36', 90, 2, 5, 186398) l dealt with it at length in the pages of Young India sometime ago.
('36', 90, 3, 6, 186466) Now for your question.
('36', 90, 3, 7, 186489) The position in India at the present moment is, in my opinion, only seemingly hopeless.
('36', 90, 3, 8, 186577) And, it is hopeless not because the different parties have no coherent programme, but because no party has got the force of arms or any other at its back to vindicate its policy if the Government reject it as it has repeatedly rejected every party’s programme.
('36', 90, 3, 9, 186838) Let me remind you that the differences between the parties here, so far as the demands are concerned, are not of principles but of experience.
('36', 90, 3, 10, 186981) If the Liberal Party pitches its demands low, it does so not because more cannot be digested, but because more cannot be obtained.
('36', 90, 3, 11, 187112) But, if the Govern ment were to grant all the demands of say the Swaraj Party, the other parties would join.
('36', 90, 3, 12, 187221) This I say, apart, of course, from the communal trouble, of which I write later.
('36', 90, 3, 13, 187302) Therefore, if the Independent Labour Party confers with the most forward party in India and evolves a constitution which is accepted by the Parliament, you will find all parties acclaiming it.
('36', 90, 3, 14, 187495) So, if I were you and if I was called upon to guide or lead the Independent Labour Party, I would go to India, find out the forward party, confer with its leaders and then evolve a programme by which I would stick through thick and thin.
('36', 90, 4, 15, 187733) But the communal trouble does block the way.
('36', 90, 4, 16, 187778) And again thinking in your terms, I would reason thus: ‘These Indians —Hindus and Mussalmans—are fighting like cats and dogs amongst themselves, but they have neither the means nor the courage of fighting against my country which has wronged them in the past and which is still wronging them.
('36', 90, 4, 17, 188071) I don’t want to be a party to that wrong any longer.
('36', 90, 4, 18, 188124) They will fight.
('36', 90, 4, 19, 188141) That fight must end soon, if my country will not aggravate it and prolong it either consciously or unconsciously.
('36', 90, 4, 20, 188255) I must have no communalism on Statute book.
('36', 90, 4, 21, 188299) I would provide for all parties equal opportunities and I would have preference in education for weaker parties whether in numbers or otherwise.
('36', 90, 4, 22, 188444) I would therefore make statutory provision for such preferential education.
('36', 90, 4, 23, 188520) If you approach the question with this mentality, you will not need agreement amongst all parties about communal representation, but you will deal with it along lines of substantial justice.
('36', 90, 4, 24, 188711) This seems to me to be the only way of evolving a constitution in the present disturbed
('36', 91, 0, 1, 188799) 92 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 91, 1, 2, 188840) state of things.
('36', 91, 1, 3, 188857) Then there remains your last question.
('36', 91, 1, 4, 188896) I do indeed think that the authorities are partly responsible for the communal dissensions.
('36', 91, 1, 5, 188988) I know that primarily the fault is ours.
('36', 91, 1, 6, 189029) If we were not disposed to quarrel, no outside power on earth could make us.
('36', 91, 1, 7, 189106) But, when an outside power whose strength lies in our weakness notices our dissensions, it takes advantage of them consciously or unconsciously.
('36', 91, 1, 8, 189251) Everyone in India knows this and feels the effect of it also.
('36', 91, 1, 9, 189313) Some honest British officials have not hesitated to make the admission before me and some have unguardedly betrayed themselves by making inconvenient admissions or remarks.
('36', 91, 1, 10, 189486) But I must not labour this point.
('36', 91, 1, 11, 189520) I am well aware that you can do nothing to remedy this evil even if you believed in it.
('36', 91, 1, 12, 189608) The remedy lies entirely in our own hands.
('36', 91, 1, 13, 189651) All that you can do is to give us, if you are in power, a good and workable constitution.
('36', 91, 1, 14, 189741) But you will certainly not be able to control your agents here.
('36', 91, 1, 15, 189805) The agents themselves know that they are agents only in name but in reality they are principals.
('36', 91, 1, 16, 189902) I have before now described the Civil Service as a gigantic and most powerful secret corporation that the world has.
('36', 91, 1, 17, 190019) Like the Masonic Brotherhood, it has got its signs and its unwritten language through which it corresponds with its members.
('36', 91, 1, 18, 190144) Nor need this surprise anybody.
('36', 91, 1, 19, 190176) It is impossible, without resort to dubious methods, for one hundred thousand men to live in the midst of three hundred million human beings and impose their rule and trade upon them against their will.
('36', 91, 1, 20, 190379) I think I have covered the full ground of your letter.
('36', 91, 1, 21, 190434) I hope I am intelligible.
('36', 91, 1, 22, 190460) I may not convince you of the positions I have taken up.
('36', 91, 1, 23, 190517) I would gladly argue further, if you wish me to.
('36', 91, 1, 24, 190566) I thank you for the most careful and sympathetic manner in which you are approaching this important question which is one of life and death to us.
('36', 91, 2, 25, 190713) Yours sincerely, DR.

('36', 92, 3, 4, 191023) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter with your interesting notes for which I thank you.
('36', 92, 3, 5, 191106) We were all so happy to have you in our midst.
('36', 92, 3, 6, 191153) I only wish you could have stayed longer with us.
('36', 92, 3, 7, 191203) Then, perhaps, you would have toned down some of the remarks you have made about the Ashram and revised your criticism about its becoming self supporting.
('36', 92, 3, 8, 191358) To make it self supporting is not our aim so long as we undertake public education in the matter of the spinning wheel, untouchability, etc.
('36', 92, 3, 9, 191499) The suggestion to build a pigeon loft was made by another friend also.
('36', 92, 3, 10, 191570) We did not take it up because it was suggested that it would simply attract more pigeons without relieving us of their presence in the roof of our cottages.
('36', 92, 3, 11, 191727) Have you tried the thing yourself with success?
('36', 92, 3, 12, 191775) I shall endeavour to go through the Science of Power which you have so kindly ordered for me.
('36', 92, 3, 13, 191869) I have developed the greatest disinclination for writing anything whatsoever.
('36', 92, 3, 14, 191947) If I could suspend the papers I am editing, I would even do that.
('36', 92, 3, 15, 192013) But it is a self imposed task which I dare not shirk.
('36', 92, 3, 16, 192067) You will, therefore, excuse me at least for the present if I do not write for the Fellowship of the Friends of Jesus.

('36', 93, 1, 3, 192600) I think it altogether improper that public money should be deposited in a Government bank.
('36', 93, 1, 4, 192691) However, we have at present no facility of depositing our money in a place where it would be safe and yet beyond the control of the Government.
('36', 93, 1, 5, 192835) Let us remember that we are not complete non co operators.
('36', 93, 1, 6, 192894) We have non co operated only in spheres in which non co operation is possible.
('36', 93, 1, 7, 192973) If we wish to have no connection with banks which are subject to Government’s control, we should have nothing to do with currency.
('36', 93, 1, 8, 193104) The truth is that, under an unjust Government, possession of money is a crime, but we remain committing it as it is inescapable.

('36', 93, 6, 15, 193592) After reading it, I have written to Ramji and advised him to be patient and, if necessary, to have an additional lavatory constructed.
('36', 93, 6, 16, 193727) I get your letters regularly.
('36', 93, 6, 17, 193757) I liked the argument you advanced to Ghanshyamdas.
('36', 93, 6, 18, 193808) I cannot see how it can be improved upon.

('36', 95, 3, 5, 195505) I have even got copy of a notice served on them.
('36', 95, 3, 6, 195554) They were permitted till now to have darshan from a distance, but they say that even that privilege is withheld from them now.
('36', 95, 3, 7, 195681) If we take any public step, the Antyajas may be subjected to greater harassment.
('36', 95, 3, 8, 195762) You should, therefore, go to Dakor, since you are near the place.
('36', 95, 3, 9, 195828) I should like you to find out the real position and see the Secretary of the Municipality and so on.
('36', 95, 3, 10, 195929) The Antyaja priest there is called Sadhu Fakirdas.
('36', 95, 3, 11, 195980) It seems he has built a small dharmashala, but Fakirdas says that they put difficulties in the way of Antyajas using that also.

('36', 95, 9, 18, 196391) I was happy.
('36', 95, 9, 19, 196404) Your decision to save money and use it as you intend to is worthy of you.
('36', 95, 9, 20, 196478) Your diet, too, is right one.
('36', 95, 9, 21, 196508) I can suggest no improvement in it.
('36', 95, 9, 22, 196544) I agree with you that we cannot put more pressure for the use of khadi than is being done.
('36', 95, 9, 23, 196635) Tell the students that I expect the alumni of Dakshinamurti to be perfect devotees of khadi and set an example to pupils in other schools.

('36', 96, 1, 2, 197082) If anyone refuses to do this, reason gently with him.
('36', 96, 1, 3, 197136) I don’t think it is necessary to do more than that.
('36', 96, 1, 4, 197188) If you feel like travelling, you need not suppress the desire, but it is not necessary either to spend money for that purpose.
('36', 96, 1, 5, 197315) The man who travels by rail observes not more, but less, than the one who travels on foot.
('36', 96, 1, 6, 197406) The reason which you have advanced for my undertaking a tour does not justify any expenditure at all.
('36', 96, 1, 7, 197508) I am sure you know that Surendra toured on foot for a whole year, going as far as Uttarkashi.
('36', 96, 1, 8, 197602) This is not to suggest that you should never travel by rail.
('36', 96, 1, 9, 197663) You may certainly do that.
('36', 96, 1, 10, 197690) Personally, I think that those who have adopted khadi as a matter of principle should not wear foreign cloth even when acting on the stage and even though such cloth might be offered them as a gift.
('36', 96, 1, 11, 197889) By wearing such cloth, they increase its importance.
('36', 96, 1, 12, 197942) The use of foreign cloth for costumes on the stage implies that there is one occasion on which its use is absolutely necessary.
('36', 96, 1, 13, 198070) Those who go to theatres are generally pleasure loving people.
('36', 96, 1, 14, 198133) More likely than not, they have never heard about khadi.
('36', 96, 1, 15, 198190) By using foreign cloth for the purpose of costumes, we miss the only opportunity of awakening love of khadi in such persons.
('36', 96, 1, 16, 198315) You may certainly stay there as long as it suits you.
('36', 96, 1, 17, 198369) I am glad that you wrote to me.

('36', 97, 3, 4, 199065) DEAR VITHALBHAI, I have your letters with cheques in all amounting to Rs. 7,575, being a portion of your three months’ salary as the Speaker of the Assembly together with the balance of the purse of Rs. 5,000 presented to you.
('36', 97, 3, 5, 199292) 1 You have asked me to spend the amount for ‘an object calculated to promote the national welfare in such manner as I may approve’.
('36', 97, 3, 6, 199424) Since writing that letter, you have discussed with me personally your views about the use of your handsome donation.
('36', 97, 3, 7, 199541) I have been taxing myself as to what I should really do, and I have finally come to the decision to let the amount accumulate for the present.
('36', 97, 3, 8, 199684) And I am therefore depositing the money in the agency account of the Ashram for six months certainly, so as to get a fair interest.
('36', 97, 3, 9, 199816) And as soon as party feeling has eased, I propose to invite the co operation of a few mutual friends and then in consultation with you and them to use the money for some commendable national purpose.
('36', 97, 3, 10, 200016) Meanwhile, I tender my congratulations for the generous spirit which has actuated you in parting with a large portion of your salary for a public object.
('36', 97, 3, 11, 200170) Let me hope that your example will prove infectious.
('36', 97, 3, 12, 200223) Yours sincerely M. K. GANDHI SJT.

('36', 97, 6, 16, 200422) DEAR VITHALBHAI, Almost every day I have been obliged to put off this enclosed little letter 2. Something or other has come in to postpone it.
('36', 97, 7, 17, 200565) 1 For earlier correspondence on the subject.

('36', 98, 1, 3, 200792) If you have any alterations to suggest, absence of any telegram from you I shall regard as a warning not to publish the correspondence and shall await your suggestions.

('36', 98, 5, 8, 201063) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, Asadha Sud 15, 1982 [July 25, 1926]
('36', 98, 6, 9, 201122) RAMDAS, I have your letter.
('36', 98, 6, 10, 201150) My impression is that no letter of yours has remained unanswered.
('36', 98, 6, 11, 201216) Maybe I have not replied to your last letter, I am not sure if I did.
('36', 98, 6, 12, 201286) But I am under the impression that I replied to that letter too.
('36', 98, 6, 13, 201351) I have fully understood what you say about agriculture.
('36', 98, 6, 14, 201407) I do not mean that every rich man ill treats his labourers.
('36', 98, 6, 15, 201467) What you have observed in Kathiawar is certainly found in many other places, too, but the vast majority carry on their farming in the manner I have described.
('36', 98, 6, 16, 201626) That of course does not mean that in agriculture the labourer cannot but be exploited.
('36', 98, 6, 17, 201713) A well informed cultivator who has had long experience of farming can successfully carry on and earn enough for his purpose, even if he pays his labourers generously.
('36', 98, 6, 18, 201880) I think that such a person would need adequate capital; that has been my experience and others’ too.
('36', 98, 6, 19, 201981) Send me as soon as you can all the information in regard to khadi which I have requested people through Navajivan to supply to me.
('36', 98, 6, 20, 202112) Send me a short note on your own experiences.
('36', 98, 6, 21, 202158) Harilal has been here for the last three days.
('36', 98, 6, 22, 202205) It is not certain at the moment how long he will remain.
('36', 98, 6, 23, 202262) Have you signed the document respecting the house in Rajkot?
('36', 98, 6, 24, 202323) If you have not signed it already, consult me before you do.
('36', 98, 6, 25, 202384) It seems to me that your aunt’s position needs to be strengthened still further.
('36', 98, 6, 26, 202465) If that has been done, there is no harm in your signing the document.

('36', 99, 5, 7, 202801) KAKU, At last Harilal has arrived here.
('36', 99, 5, 8, 202841) I had got your telegram.
('36', 99, 5, 9, 202866) I had expected that I would be informed when he was likely to arrive.
('36', 99, 5, 10, 202936) I did not send anyone to the station on Tuesday.
('36', 99, 5, 11, 202985) No one was expecting Harilal when he arrived.
('36', 99, 5, 12, 203031) I continue to get letters from aunt telling me of her anxieties.
('36', 99, 5, 13, 203096) She does not trust you.
('36', 99, 5, 14, 203120) She wants some definite arrangement to be made.
('36', 99, 5, 15, 203168) I, therefore, think that you should put out the rent at interest and arrange the interest to be paid to her.
('36', 99, 5, 16, 203277) This will be a convenient arrangement for all you brothers and will also reassure aunt.
('36', 99, 5, 17, 203365) Alternatively, take a house on long lease in her name and let her live in it.
('36', 99, 5, 18, 203443) Adopt whichever course you like, but I want you to do something to relieve her anxieties.
('36', 99, 5, 19, 203533) It was only from Harilal that I knew that you had been here and stayed with Jivanlal.

('36', 99, 9, 23, 203752) BHAISHRI BALVANTRAI, I have your letter.
('36', 99, 9, 24, 203793) I understand your position better now.
('36', 99, 9, 25, 203832) First of all, you should explain everything clearly to your brother and wife, though, before you do that, you should visit the Ashram and acquaint yourself with the conditions here.
('36', 99, 9, 26, 204014) The Ashram is open to Bhangis.
('36', 99, 9, 27, 204045) Just now, there are two Antyaja children living in it, and all the inmates have their

('36', 100, 1, 2, 204175) meals together.
('36', 100, 1, 3, 204191) The Antyaja children are permitted to enter the kitchen and also help in the cooking.
('36', 100, 1, 4, 204277) Everyone cleans his own lavatory; that is, no inmate can refuse to do this work.
('36', 100, 1, 5, 204358) The inmates spend most of their time in body labour.
('36', 100, 1, 6, 204411) All this may be acceptableto you, but you should also ascertain whether it will be acceptable to your brother and wife.
('36', 100, 1, 7, 204531) Even if they say that it will be, you should take no step till you have observed the conditions for yourself and have had some experience of living here.
('36', 100, 1, 8, 204685) I have also observed that people who cannot preserve cleanliness in unclean surroundings do not do much better even when they go to live in what they suppose to be clean surroundings.
('36', 100, 1, 9, 204869) The saying, “If we ourselves are good, the whole world is good”; is worth pondering over.
('36', 100, 1, 10, 204959) Do not, therefore, assume that you will be safe once you are here, nor that everyone who lives here is or has become pure.
('36', 100, 1, 11, 205082) In every house, the oven is made of earth.
('36', 100, 1, 12, 205125) 1 All that can be said about this place is that some of the inmates are striving hard for self purification.

('36', 100, 8, 19, 205510) As regards your earlier letter about the Khadi Pratishan, Bapu says it really contains nothing that calls for his comment.
('36', 100, 8, 20, 205633) He agrees with you that one must not mix business and philanthropy.
('36', 100, 8, 21, 205701) He says the only way you could help them would be to advance them a loan of Rs. 30,000/ to be paid back in January next.

('36', 101, 3, 4, 206004) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('36', 101, 3, 5, 206037) I am exceedingly sorry that the letter addressed to you which was rather important went to Germany and that the German letter was sent to you.
('36', 101, 3, 6, 206180) The only reparation I can now make is to send you a copy of my letter 1, which happily I possess.
('36', 101, 3, 7, 206278) I have read your letter to Mr. Andrews.
('36', 101, 3, 8, 206318) Mr. Andrews will be in South Africa some time in October, I hope.
('36', 101, 3, 9, 206384) I know you are having an anxious time.
('36', 101, 3, 10, 206423) Everything that is humanly possible is being done here.
('36', 101, 3, 11, 206479) But, as you have rightly pointed out in your letter to Mr. Andrews, we are ourselves to blame.
('36', 101, 3, 12, 206574) I am still, however, hoping thatsomething good will turn out as a result of the forthcoming Conference.

('36', 102, 3, 4, 207210) I can never give up the hopes I cherish of Maharashtra and Maharashtrians.
('36', 102, 3, 5, 207285) The Maharashtra which has always taught the motherland the lessons of self sacrifice and learning will never be indifferent to the poor man’s charkha and khadi.
('36', 102, 3, 6, 207446) I have said that in the mantra 2 “swaraj is my birth right”, which the Lokamanya taught the country, he supplied the first half of the shloka 3, and that I supplied the second half by saying that the charkha and khadi are the means of winning swaraj.
('36', 102, 3, 7, 207697) When will Maharashtra take the first place among those who accept this means?

('36', 102, 9, 13, 207917) Call back from Bhai Shambhushanker all of my letters.
('36', 102, 9, 14, 207971) From the quotation, it is clear that I had in mind the salary due to him in the past.
('36', 102, 9, 15, 208057) I could not have given him a permanent guarantee of salary to be paid to him in future.
('36', 102, 9, 16, 208145) If he is just unable to do any work in Gariyadhar, it means he is asking for a salary for doing nothing.
('36', 102, 9, 17, 208250) That cannot be done.
('36', 102, 9, 18, 208271) You may now do what you think proper after inspecting the work.
('36', 102, 9, 19, 208335) If the work at Gariyadhar seems to you to be useless, pay off the men what you think reasonable and stop the work.
('36', 102, 9, 20, 208450) If you wish, you may send Bhai Shambhushanker a copy of this letter.
('36', 102, 9, 21, 208519) I had seriously warned Balwantrai about the note of Rs. 500, but as he is still unable to pay, I do not feel like sending him any more money.
('36', 102, 10, 22, 208661) 1 The occasion for this message appears to have been the death anniversary of Lokamanya Tilak.

('36', 103, 1, 2, 209043) However, taking it that his note is not connected with the Panch Talavadi 1, it seems all right to send him the Rs. 100 he has asked for.
('36', 103, 1, 3, 209181) That is, send it if you are satisfied with the work at Panch Talavadi.
('36', 103, 1, 4, 209252) Nothing need be sent to Vajeshanker so long as you or somebody else has not examined his work.

('36', 103, 7, 10, 209598) MY DEAR GANGADHARRAO,
('36', 103, 8, 11, 209620) I have your very full letter about your activities.
('36', 103, 8, 12, 209672) I trace in that letter signs of both hope and despair.
('36', 103, 8, 13, 209727) There is no cause whatsoever for despair.
('36', 103, 8, 14, 209769) If our experiment is thorough, i.e., only in accordance with the fundamentals, there never need be the slightest cause for despair.
('36', 103, 8, 15, 209901) Idleness has taken possession of the poor, because they have lost all interest in living.
('36', 103, 8, 16, 209991) They will begin to take interest only after we have worked in their midst for [a] sufficiently long time.
('36', 103, 8, 17, 210097) We may wait for full effect even for ages if we are satisfied that our way is the only way of solving the problem of the masses.
('36', 103, 8, 18, 210226) It is because of our unbelief and impatience that often we run from remedy to remedy, nothing takes root and the position goes from bad to worse.
('36', 103, 8, 19, 210372) About the disinclination of the weavers to weave hand spun yarn, there are two reasons.
('36', 103, 8, 20, 210460) One is that our yarn is not as strong as mill yarn and the other is [that] the weavers are not satisfied that hand weaving has come to stay.
('36', 103, 8, 21, 210601) Time will give them the necessary faith and our application must improve the quality of the yarn.
('36', 103, 8, 22, 210699) Day after day, we must insist upon the spinners giving us better yarn.
('36', 103, 8, 23, 210770) We have to examine their spinning wheels correct their defects so as to enable the spinners to draw better yarn with greater rapidity.

('36', 105, 6, 8, 212800) DEAR JANAKDHARI BABU, How should I forget you?
('36', 105, 6, 9, 212847) Your letter though saddening is welcome.
('36', 105, 6, 10, 212888) I shall deal with it in Y.I. Meanwhile consult Rajendra Babu and, if you find that you cannot usefully carry out the constructive programme, you may resign in a body.
('36', 105, 6, 11, 213055) But this means that you will work away at the Congress organization whether you are one or many but only non violently and truthfully.
('36', 105, 6, 12, 213190) If you do not understand this and if time presses, elect your office bearers.
('36', 105, 6, 13, 213268) There is always time for resigning, if you cannot work satisfactorily.
('36', 105, 6, 14, 213339) Let nothing be done in a hurry.

('36', 108, 6, 12, 217184) You are right when you say that the Mahavidyalaya has not yet reached a position where it can train workers for villages.
('36', 108, 6, 13, 217306) We have still not been able to decide what changes to introduce which the students will welcome.
('36', 108, 6, 14, 217403) I think we have made no mistake in appointing the 2 as teachers in the college.
('36', 108, 6, 15, 217483) They do not find themselves in as miserable a condition as you think.
('36', 108, 6, 16, 217553) I know that a snataka of even an ordinary calibre is able to earn enough for his living.
('36', 108, 6, 17, 217642) My replies are always, from my point of view, practicable, but I can understand that they may not appeal to all.
('36', 108, 6, 18, 217755) What else can a believer in the reality of soul force say?
('36', 108, 6, 19, 217814) If the students in hostels are pleasure loving, who is to blame for that?
('36', 108, 6, 20, 217888) What can the teachers do in that matter?
('36', 108, 6, 21, 217929) It is for the students themselves to change their way of living.
('36', 108, 6, 22, 217994) About reading the Gita, the Ramayana and other such books to children, my view differs from yours, and so I am helpless.
('36', 108, 6, 23, 218115) Henceforward, I intend to visit the Mahavidyalaya every Saturday.

('36', 109, 3, 7, 218777) It is a difficult job to persuade the sadhus to take up active work.
('36', 109, 3, 8, 218846) No improvement can come so long as the prevailing idea—that giving alms to any beggar who comes along is an act of virtue—does not change.
('36', 109, 3, 9, 218985) Such a change can come about only in the course of time.
('36', 109, 3, 10, 219042) What I meant to say, and would say, was “things which we cannot, and need not produce, and against the import of which there can be no objection”.

('36', 109, 9, 21, 219733) I have not yet been able to reach my Hindi correspondence.

('36', 110, 1, 2, 220147) I entered upon in the first instance, which you will remember.
('36', 110, 1, 3, 220210) But Narayandas has gone to Bombay to take stock of the two Bombay stores.
('36', 110, 1, 4, 220284) As soon as he returns, I shall make further enquiries about it.
('36', 110, 1, 5, 220348) In no case need there be any formal intimation because there is no question of taking Utkal responsibility off your shoulders.
('36', 110, 1, 6, 220475) Have the riots affected the sales all over Bengal, or is the effect confined only to Calcutta?

('36', 111, 1, 3, 221487) Will you kindly attend to this matter?
('36', 111, 1, 4, 221526) She ought not to be kept without funds indefinitely.
('36', 111, 1, 5, 221579) This association is run by philanthrophic ladies.
('36', 111, 1, 6, 221629) No profits are made by them and every pice goes into the hands of the poor women who are working at producing fancy designs, etc.
('36', 111, 1, 7, 221759) Apart, however, from the fact that this is a purely philanthropic work, we should not ourselves be unbusinesslike and not carry out obligations.

('36', 112, 11, 19, 223847) I was much concerned to read that you were having fever and had an attack of chicken pox.
('36', 112, 11, 20, 223937) I hope you are all right now.

('36', 113, 1, 4, 224270) The substance of what I have been saying on the Gita in my discourses is likely to be published in Hindi, sooner or later.
('36', 113, 1, 5, 224393) But that will take some time.

('36', 113, 6, 15, 224871) I was happy to learn about the conditions there.
('36', 113, 6, 16, 224920) It would be very good if we could persuade people to take up spinning again.

('36', 114, 6, 10, 226166) A friend has sent me a gist of what appears in the Southern vernacular press from the pen of a learned Pundit.
('36', 114, 6, 11, 226277) He summarizes the Pundit’s plea for untouchability in this fashion:
('36', 114, 7, 12, 226345) (1) The fact that once Adi Shankara asked a Chandala to be aloof from him, and the fact that Trishanku when he was condemned to be a Chandala was
('36', 114, 8, 13, 226491) shunned by all people, prove that untouchability is not of recent growth.
('36', 114, 9, 14, 226565) (2) The Chandalas are the outcastes of the Aryan society.
('36', 114, 10, 15, 226623) (3) The untouchables themselves are not free from the sin of untouchability.
('36', 114, 11, 16, 226700) (4) The untouchables are so because they kill animals and because they have constantly to do with flesh, blood, bones and night soil.
('36', 114, 12, 17, 226834) (5) The untouchables must be isolated even as slaughter houses, toddy shops and houses of ill fame are or should be.
('36', 114, 13, 18, 226951) (6) It should be enough that untouchables are not denied the privileges of the other world.
('36', 114, 14, 19, 227043) (7) A Gandhi may touch these people, but so can he fast.
('36', 114, 14, 20, 227100) We may neither fast nor touch the untouchables.
('36', 114, 15, 21, 227148) (8) Untouchability is a necessity for man’s growth.
('36', 114, 16, 22, 227200) (9) Man has magnetic powers about him.
('36', 114, 16, 23, 227239) This sakti is like milk.
('36', 114, 17, 24, 227264) will be damaged by improper contacts.
('36', 114, 17, 25, 227302) If one can keep musk and onion together, one may mix Brahmans and untouchables.
('36', 114, 17, 26, 227382) These are the chief points summarized by the correspondent.
('36', 114, 17, 27, 227442) Untouchability is a hydra headed monster.
('36', 114, 17, 28, 227484) It is therefore necessary,
('36', 115, 0, 1, 227511) 116 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 115, 1, 2, 227553) each time the monster lifts its head, to deal with it.
('36', 115, 1, 3, 227608) The stories told in the Puranas are some of them most dangerous if we do not know their bearing on the present conditions.
('36', 115, 1, 4, 227731) The Shastras would be death traps if we were to regulate our conduct according to every detail given in them or according to that of the characters therein described.
('36', 115, 1, 5, 227898) They help us only to define and argue out fundamental principles.
('36', 115, 1, 6, 227964) If some well known character in religious books sinned against God or man, is that a warrant for our repeating the sin?
('36', 115, 1, 7, 228084) It is enough for us to be told, once for all, [that] Truth is the only thing that matters in the world, that Truth is God.
('36', 115, 1, 8, 228207) It is irrelevant to be told that even Yudhishthira was betrayed into an untruth.
('36', 115, 1, 9, 228288) It is more relevant for US to know that when he spoke an untruth, he had to suffer for it that very moment and that his great name in no way protected him from punishment.
('36', 115, 1, 10, 228460) Similarly, it is irrelevant for us to be told that Adi Shankara avoided a Chandala.
('36', 115, 1, 11, 228544) It is enough for us to know that a religion that teaches us to treat all that lives as we treat ourselves cannot possibly countenance the inhuman treatment of a single creature, let alone a whole class of perfectly innocent human beings.
('36', 115, 1, 12, 228782) Moreover, we have not even all the facts before us to judge what Adi Shankara did or did not do.
('36', 115, 1, 13, 228879) Still less do we know the meaning of the word Chandala where it occurs.
('36', 115, 1, 14, 228951) It has admittedly many meanings, one of which is a sinner.
('36', 115, 1, 15, 229010) But if all sinners are to be regarded as untouchables, it is very much to be feared that we should all, not excluding the Pundit himself, be under the ban of untouchability.
('36', 115, 1, 16, 229184) That untouchability is an old institution, nobody has ever denied.
('36', 115, 1, 17, 229251) But, if it is an evil, it cannot be defended on the ground of its antiquity.
('36', 115, 2, 18, 229328) If the untouchables are the outcastes of the Aryan society, so much the worse for that society.
('36', 115, 2, 19, 229424) And, if the Aryans at some stage in their progress regarded a certain class of people as outcastes by way of punishment, there is no reason why that punishment should descend upon their progeny irrespective of the causes for which their ancestors were punished.
('36', 115, 3, 20, 229686) That there is untouchability even amongst untouchables merely demonstrates that that evil cannot be confined and that its deadening effect is all pervading.
('36', 115, 3, 21, 229843) The existence of untouchability amongst untouchables is an additional reason for cultured Hindu society to rid itself of the curse with the quickest despatch.
('36', 115, 4, 22, 230002) If the untouchables are so because they kill animals and because
('36', 116, 0, 1, 230067) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 117
('36', 116, 1, 2, 230111) they have to do with flesh, blood, bones and night soil, every nurse and every doctor should become an untouchable and so should Christians, Mussalmans and all so called high class Hindus who kill animals for food or sacrifice.
('36', 116, 1, 3, 230339) The argument that because slaughter houses, toddy shops, and houses of ill fame are or should be isolated, untouchables should likewise be isolated betrays gross prejudice.
('36', 116, 1, 4, 230512) Slaughter houses and toddy shops are and should be isolated.
('36', 116, 1, 5, 230573) But neither butchers nor publicans are isolated.
('36', 116, 1, 6, 230622) Prostitutes should be isolated because their occupation is revolting and detrimental to the well being of society.
('36', 116, 1, 7, 230737) Whereas the occupation of ‘untouchables’ is not only desirable but a necessity for the well being of the society.
('36', 116, 1, 8, 230851) To say that ‘untouchables’ are not denied privileges of the other world is the acme of insolence.
('36', 116, 1, 9, 230949) If it was possible to deny them the privileges of the other world, it is highly likely that the defenders of the monster would isolate them even in the other world.
('36', 116, 1, 10, 231114) It is throwing dust in the eyes of the people to say that ‘a Gandhi may touch the “untouchables”, not so other people,’ as if the touching and service of ‘untouchables’ was so injurious as to require for it men specially proof against untouchable germs.
('36', 116, 1, 11, 231368) Heaven only knows what punishment is in store for Mussalmans, Christians and others who do not believe in untouchability.
('36', 116, 1, 12, 231490) The plea of animal magnetism is altogether overdone.
('36', 116, 1, 13, 231543) The high class men are not all sweet smelling like musk, nor are untouchables foul smelling like onion.
('36', 116, 1, 14, 231647) There are thousands of untouchables who are any day infinitely superior to the so called high class people.
('36', 116, 1, 15, 231755) It is painful to discover that even after five years of continuous propaganda against untouchability, there are learned people enough found to support such an immoral and evil custom.
('36', 116, 1, 16, 231939) That belief in untouchability can co exist with learning in the same person adds no status to untouchability, but makes one despair of mere learning being any aid to Character or sanity.

('36', 117, 0, 1, 232259) 118 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 117, 1, 2, 232301) On reading your article on “Mahatmaji’s order” in Young India dated
('36', 117, 2, 3, 232369) 24th June 1926, the following doubts have arisen in my mind:
('36', 117, 3, 4, 232430) You assign a great place to reason.
('36', 117, 3, 5, 232466) Have you not also written in the pages of Young India or Navajivan that reason is like the King of England
('36', 117, 4, 6, 232573) entirely in the hands of its ministers the senses.
('36', 117, 4, 7, 232624) Does not man often reason in the direction the senses guide him?
('36', 117, 4, 8, 232689) How then can you take reason to be the guide?
('36', 117, 4, 9, 232735) Have you not said that argument follows conviction?
('36', 117, 4, 10, 232787) If then one has not the heart to spin one will find reasons against spinning.
('36', 117, 4, 11, 232865) How far is it advisable to tax the reason of little children?
('36', 117, 4, 12, 232927) That great educational reformer Rousseau said that childhood was the sleep of reason.
('36', 117, 4, 13, 233013) He therefore advocated merely the teaching of good habits during that age.
('36', 117, 4, 14, 233088) And surely to teach children to obey the orders of a Mahatma especially when they involve physical labour is to cultivate a good habit.
('36', 117, 4, 15, 233224) When the children grow up, they will find out the reasons for spinning.
('36', 117, 4, 16, 233296) But is it wrong till then to inculcate that spirit of ‘blind hero worship’ as you prefer to call it?
('36', 117, 4, 17, 233397) Have we not made a fetish of reason in these day?
('36', 117, 4, 18, 233447) For simple little things we undergo long and laborious processes of reasoning and do not even then feel satisfied.
('36', 117, 4, 19, 233562) Reason, no doubt, has its place, but, surely much below the rank that we now give it.
('36', 117, 5, 20, 233648) It is wrong to quote a person against himself unless one is sure of what he has said and under what circumstances.
('36', 117, 5, 21, 233763) All the statements the correspondent ascribes to me have undoubtedly been made by me at some time or other, but under totally different circumstances.
('36', 117, 5, 22, 233914) Where it is perfectly possible to reason out a thing to the satisfaction even of children, there is no occasion for quoting authority and asking them to obey it.
('36', 117, 5, 23, 234076) Very often it is a misleading process.
('36', 117, 5, 24, 234115) Everyone has his likes and dislikes.
('36', 117, 5, 25, 234152) And when a man has begun to believe in a hero, he gives his reason the go by and makes of his hero a fetish.
('36', 117, 5, 26, 234261) This, I consider, is blind heroworship.
('36', 117, 5, 27, 234301) Hero worship is a fine quality.
('36', 117, 5, 28, 234333) No nation or individual can make progress who has no hero for their model.
('36', 117, 5, 29, 234408) The hero serves as an inspiration.
('36', 117, 5, 30, 234443) He makes action possible which, in our weakness, is otherwise impossible.
('36', 117, 5, 31, 234517) He helps us out of the Slough of Despond.
('36', 117, 5, 32, 234559) The memory of his deeds enables us to go through endless sacrifice.
('36', 117, 5, 33, 234627) But, he must not be allowed to warp our judgment and paralyse our reason.
('36', 117, 5, 34, 234701) The sayings and actions of the tallest among us must bear a most searching scrutiny, for, heroes are mortals.
('36', 117, 5, 35, 234811) They are as liable to mistakes as the weakest among us.
('36', 117, 5, 36, 234867) Their strength lies in their decision and power for action.
('36', 117, 5, 37, 234927) They are therefore terrible when they make mistakes.
('36', 117, 5, 38, 234980) They bring woe to the man or the nation that go in for blind hero worship and slavishly accept all the
('36', 118, 0, 1, 235083) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 119
('36', 118, 1, 2, 235127) acts and sayings of their heroes without question.
('36', 118, 1, 3, 235178) Blind hero worship is, therefore, worse than blind worship of reason.
('36', 118, 1, 4, 235248) Indeed, blind worship of reason is a misnomer.
('36', 118, 1, 5, 235295) But the correspondent’s warning about reason serves one useful purpose.
('36', 118, 1, 6, 235367) Seeing that reason in the vast majority of cases is the only guide to conduct, we must have for her pure and obedient ministers.
('36', 118, 1, 7, 235496) The senses must therefore be brought under control and subjected to the severest discipline so that they may be willing instruments in the hands of reason instead of reason being their helpless slave.
('36', 118, 1, 8, 235697) The reason of little children is, no doubt, asleep, but, a vigilant teacher would gently coax it and, waking it, teach the children habits of discipline so that their reason, being freed from the control of their senses, would become from the very child.
('36', 118, 1, 9, 235952) hood their guide.
('36', 118, 1, 10, 235970) It is no discipline to tell the children to follow a hero.
('36', 118, 1, 11, 236029) No habit is cultivated thereby.
('36', 118, 1, 12, 236061) The children who are taught to slavishly do things become sluggish.
('36', 118, 1, 13, 236129) And if perchance another schoolmaster displaces from the throne of their hearts the hero, presented to them by his predecessor, they are likely to become unhinged and useless in after life.
('36', 118, 1, 14, 236319) Whereas, If from the very commencement whatever is placed before them is reasoned out for them, and then examples of great men having done noble deeds placed before them to strengthen their resolve or support their reason, they are likely to develop into strong hardy citizens who, under difficult circumstances, will be able to render a good amount of themselves.

('36', 118, 4, 17, 236746) The Honorary Treasurers have issued an exhaustive statement of the All India Tilak Memorial Fund up to the end of 30th September, 1925. The statement is audited by Messrs Dalal and Shah.
('36', 118, 4, 18, 236933) The auditors who are Incorporated Accountants (London) state:
('36', 118, 5, 19, 236995) We visited all the Provincial Committees except the C.P. (Hindustani), C.P. (Marathi), Berar, Burma and Assam Committees.
('36', 118, 5, 20, 237117) Although we visited the Kerala Provincial Committee, the Accounts being not ready at the time of our visit, we could not examine same.
('36', 118, 5, 21, 237252) The Accounts, however, of the C.P. (Hindustani), Berar, Assam and Burma Provincial Congress Committees have been forwarded by the Secretaries duly audited by the auditors to these Committees and are annexed herewith.
('36', 119, 0, 1, 237469) 120 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 119, 1, 2, 237511) We have verified the Investments and Securities on hand.
('36', 119, 1, 3, 237568) We could not however verify the cash on hand as we visited the centres some time after the close of the year.
('36', 119, 2, 4, 237678) It will be seen that this year also many Committees have failed to prepare Balance Sheets and Income and Expenditure Accounts, and have submitted only Receipts and Disbursements Statements.
('36', 119, 2, 5, 237868) In many cases we found that, as no balances of A sets and Liabilities from previous periods are being brought forward, it was not possible for Balance Sheets to be prepared.
('36', 119, 2, 6, 238042) Receipts and Disbursements Statements would not in the absence of Balance Sheets show the state of affairs of Committees from year to year.
('36', 119, 2, 7, 238182) Assets are likely to be lost sight of this way.
('36', 119, 3, 8, 238230) Khadi Departments, according to a resolution of the All lndia Congress Committee, have been separated in some cases.
('36', 119, 3, 9, 238347) In the case of other Committees they will be, we are informed, transferred this year to the Provincial Bodies of the All lndia Spinners’ Association.
('36', 119, 4, 10, 238497) Large amounts have been invested in the Khadi Departments of the various Committees, but we find that a considerable part of these amounts is irrecoverable and does not represent anything in the form of Assets or Stock in hand.
('36', 119, 4, 11, 238725) These amounts or the part of amounts not represented by any realizable Assets and irrecoverable should be written off.
('36', 119, 4, 12, 238844) In this connection we did draw the attention of the Committees concerned at the time of our visit.
('36', 119, 5, 13, 238943) Also, advances to workers and District Committees which are not recoverable or are by way of allowances not repayable should be written off to revenue, and not shown as Assets, as is done in several cases.

('36', 120, 4, 9, 240560) After dealing with the physiological benefit of chastity, M. Bureau quotes the following passage from Professor Montegazza on its moral and intellectual advantages:
('36', 120, 5, 10, 240725) “All men, and young men in particular, can experience the immediate benefit of chastity.
('36', 120, 5, 11, 240814) The memory is quiet and tenacious, the brain lively and fertile, the will energetic, the whole character gains a strength of which libertines have no conception; no prism shows us our surroundings under such heavenly colours as that of chastity, which lights up with its rays the least objects in the universe, and transports us into the purest joys of an abiding happiness that knows neither shadow nor decline.” And the author adds: “The joy, the cordial merriment, the sunny confidence of vigorous young men who have remained chaste .
('36', 120, 5, 12, 241352) are an eloquent contrast to the restless obsessions and feverish excitement of their companions who are slaves to the demands of sensuality.” He then compares the benefits of chastity with ‘the miserable consequences of lust and debauchery’.
('36', 120, 5, 13, 241594) “No disease,” the author states, “could ever be quoted as the result of continence; who is not aware of the frightful diseases of which moral indiscipline is the source?” “The body .
('36', 120, 5, 14, 241777) finds itself converted into an indescribable state of rottenness.
('36', 120, 5, 15, 241843) Nor can we forget the worse defilement of imagination, heart and understanding.
('36', 120, 5, 16, 241923) On every side we hear complaint of the lowering of the character, the unbridled lust of youth, the overflowing of selfishness.” So much for the so called necessity of sexual indulgence and the consequent liberty taken by the youth before marriage.
('36', 120, 5, 17, 242171) The protagonists of the doctrine of such indulgence further contend that restraint of the sexual passion is a restraint upon ‘the freedom to dispose of one’s body’.
('36', 120, 5, 18, 242336) The author shows by elaborate argument that restraint on individual freedom in the matter of sexual indulgence is a sociological and psychological necessity.
('36', 120, 5, 19, 242494) The author says,
('36', 121, 0, 1, 242511) 122 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 121, 1, 2, 242553) In the eyes of sociologists, social life is nothing but a net work of multiform relations, nothing but an interlacing of actions and reactions, in the midst of which an activity, isolated and really separated from the rest, is unthinkable.
('36', 121, 1, 3, 242793) On whatever step we resolve, whatever action we attempt, solidarity unites our resolution and our action to those of our brothers; and not even our most secret thought or most fugitive wish fails of an echo so distant that the mind is for ever incapable of measuring the distance.
('36', 121, 1, 4, 243074) The social quality is not, in man, an adventitious or merelyaccessory quality: it is immanent, part of his humanity itself; he is a social being because he is a man.
('36', 121, 1, 5, 243240) There is no other field of our activity so truly our own: physiology and morality, economics and politics, the intellectual and aesthetic domains, the religious and the social, are all conditioned by a universal system of mysterious bonds and undefined relations.
('36', 121, 1, 6, 243504) The bond is so firm, the net so closely meshed, that sometimes the sociologist stands in real trouble before this immensity which unfolds itself before him, across all time and space; he measures in one glance how great, under certain circumstances, is the responsibility of the individual, and how he risks becoming petty by a liberty which some social circles might be tempted to grant him.
('36', 121, 2, 7, 243897) The author further says,
('36', 121, 3, 8, 243922) If we can say that under certain circumstances I am not at liberty to spit in the street .
('36', 121, 3, 9, 244013) how can I claim the much more important right of disposing of my sexual energy as I like?
('36', 121, 3, 10, 244103) Does that energy by a unique privilege escape the universal law of solidarity?
('36', 121, 3, 11, 244182) Who does not see, on the contrary, that the sovereign importance of the function only increases the social reaction of the individual acts?
('36', 121, 3, 12, 244322) Look at this young man and this girl who have just established that false union of which the reader knows the character; they are persuaded that the agreement concerns nobody but themselves.
('36', 121, 3, 13, 244513) They shut themselves up in their independence, and pretend to believe that their intimate and secret action has no interest for society and is altogether beyond its control.
('36', 121, 3, 14, 244687) A childish illusion!
('36', 121, 3, 15, 244708) The social solidarity which unites the people of one nation, and, beyond the individual nations, all humanity, finds no difficulty in passing through all walls, even those of the secret chambers, and a terrible interrelation joins that supposed private action to the most distant series of actions in that social life which it helps to disorganize.
('36', 121, 3, 16, 245057) Whether he wills it or not, every individual who asserts his right to temporary or sterile sexual relations, who claims the liberty to use the reproductive energy with which he is endowed merely for his own enjoyments, spreads in society the germs of division and disorder.
('36', 121, 3, 17, 245331) All, deformed as they are by our selfishness and our disloyalties, our social institutions still take for granted that the
('36', 122, 0, 1, 245454) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 123
('36', 122, 1, 2, 245498) individual will accept with goodwill the obligations inherent in the satisfaction of the reproductive appetite.
('36', 122, 1, 3, 245610) It is by discounting this acceptance that society has built up its countless mechanisms of labour and property, of wages and inheritance, of taxation and military service, of the right of parliamentary suffrage and civil liberties.
('36', 122, 1, 4, 245842) By his refusal to: take his share the individual disorganizes everything at one stroke, he violates the social pact in its very essence, and while he makes the burden heavier on others’ shoulder, he is no better thanan exploiter and a parasite, a thief and a swindler.
('36', 122, 1, 5, 246111) We are responsible in the face of society for our physiological energy, as for all our energies, and, it might be said, even more than for all the others, since a society unarmed and almost wholly without external pressure, is obliged to remit to our goodwill the care to use that energy judiciously, and conformably to the social good.
('36', 122, 2, 6, 246448) The author is equally strong on the psychological ground:
('36', 122, 3, 7, 246506) It was said long ago that liberty is in appearance an alleviation, in reality a burden.
('36', 122, 3, 8, 246594) That is precisely its grandeur.
('36', 122, 3, 9, 246626) Liberty binds and compels; it increases the sum of the efforts which each is bound to make.
('36', 122, 3, 10, 246718) The individual desires to be free, he is all inflamed with the longing to realize himself in the expansion of his autonomy.
('36', 122, 3, 11, 246842) The programme seems simple enough, and yet his first experiences are enough to show him its painful complexity.
('36', 122, 3, 12, 246954) It is in vain that unity is the dominating characteristic of our nature and our moral life, we feel within us various and contradictory impulses; in each of them we are conscious of ourselves, and yet everything proves to us that we must choose between them.
('36', 122, 3, 13, 247213) You say, young man, that you wish to live your own life, to realize yourself, we ask with the great pedagogue, Foerster: Which is the better part, that which has its seat in the centre of your intellectual force, or that which occupies the lowest, the sensual, part of your nature?
('36', 122, 3, 14, 247495) If it is true that progress in the individual and in society consists in a growing spiritualization and in the ever more complete mastery of spirit over matter, the choice cannot be doubtful, but there must still be energy to act, and the undertaking is not an easy one.
('36', 122, 3, 15, 247766) Perhaps you will reply: But I do not choose.
('36', 122, 3, 16, 247811) I wish to realize my being in one harmonious and organized whole.
('36', 122, 3, 17, 247877) Very well; but take care this very resolution is a choice, for harmony is only established at the cost of strife.
('36', 122, 3, 18, 247991) Sterbe und Wade, die and become, said Goethe, and the words are but the
('36', 122, 4, 19, 248063) echo of others spoken nineteen centuries ago by Christ, “Amen, I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it remaineth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.”
('36', 122, 5, 20, 248261) “We wish to be men—an easy thing to say,” writes Mr. Gabriel Seailles, “but the right turns into duty, stern duty, in which no one does not
('36', 123, 0, 1, 248401) 124 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 123, 1, 2, 248443) fail more or less; we wish to be free, we announce it with a menacing air; if we call liberty doing as we like, the slavery of instinct; we need not be so proud of it; if we are speaking of the true liberty, let us gird up our loins and prepare ourselves for the unending fight.
('36', 123, 1, 3, 248722) We talk about our unity, our identity, our liberty, and proudly conclude that we are immortal sons of God.
('36', 123, 1, 4, 248829) if we only try to seize this Self, it escapes our grasp, it resolves itself into a multitude of incoherent beings which deny each other, it is rent by contradictory desires which in turn constitute itself, it is wholly (its own.essential being excepted) the prejudice to which it submits, the objects which tempt it; its pretended liberty is nothing but a slavery which does not feel, so does not resist.
('36', 123, 2, 5, 249234) “While continence is a virtue full of repose, incontinence opens the door to an unknown guest who may become formidable.
('36', 123, 2, 6, 249355) The revelation of passion, which is troublesome at any age, may become in youth the signal of a radical perversion, we would say of an irreparable disturbance of the balance of the will and the senses.
('36', 123, 2, 7, 249557) The boy who has contact for the first time with any woman whatsoever, as a passing encounter, is really playing with his physical, intellectual, and moral life; he does not know but it will be the same tomorrow in the family, at work, in social life; he does not know how the sensual revelation will come back to haunt him, what servitude without hope may represent the too exact term of “mastery”; and we know of more than one life ruined after a beginning of richest promise, the first disappointments of which dated from the first moral fall.
('36', 123, 3, 8, 250103) “The celebrated verses of the poet echo these remarks of the philosopher:
('36', 123, 4, 9, 250177) Man’s virgin soul is as a vessel deep;
('36', 123, 5, 10, 250216) If the first drops inpoured should tainted be.
('36', 123, 6, 11, 250263) Across the soul all ocean’s waves may sweep,
('36', 123, 7, 12, 250308) Yet fail that vast abyss from stain to free.
('36', 123, 8, 13, 250353) And, not less, this advice of the great British physiologist, John G. M. Kendrick, Professor of Physiology at Glasgow University:
('36', 123, 9, 14, 250483) “The illicit satisfaction of nascent passion is not only a moral fault, it is a terrible injury to the body.
('36', 123, 9, 15, 250592) The new need becomes a tyrant if yielded to; a guilty complacency will listen to it, and make it more imperious; every fresh act will forge a new link in the chain of habit.
('36', 123, 10, 16, 250766) “Many have no longer strength to break it, and helplessly end in physical and intellectual ruin, slaves of a habit contracted often through ignorance rather than perversity.
('36', 123, 10, 17, 250940) The best safeguard consists in cultivating

('36', 124, 1, 2, 251027) within oneself purity of thought and discipline of one’s whole being.” M. Bureau adds to the foregoing the following from Dr. Franck:
('36', 124, 2, 3, 251161) “As to sexual desire, we assert that the intelligence and the will have absolute control over it.
('36', 124, 2, 4, 251259) It is necessary to employ the term sexual desire, not need, for there is no question of a function, the non accomplishment of which
('36', 124, 3, 5, 251391) is incompatible wish existence.
('36', 124, 3, 6, 251423) Really, it is not a need at all; but many men are persuaded that it is.
('36', 124, 3, 7, 251495) The interpretation they give to the desires makes them look on co habitation as absolutely necessary.
('36', 124, 3, 8, 251597) Now we cannot look on the sexual act as resulting from senile and passive obedience to natural laws; we are, on the contrary, concerned with a voluntary act, following on a determin ation or an acquiescence, often premeditated and prepared for.”

('36', 124, 6, 11, 251893) The head master of the national school, Dondaicha, West Khandesh, writes: 1
('36', 124, 7, 12, 251969) This report shows clearly what earnestness can do.
('36', 124, 7, 13, 252020) The school with 150 students was no more national than any other school would be on the mere ground of not being under the Government.
('36', 124, 7, 14, 252155) A school to be national must satisfy the definition given by the Congress.
('36', 124, 7, 15, 252230) In accordance with it, among other things, it must have spinning in it and the boys and girls must wear khadi.
('36', 124, 7, 16, 252341) They must also have Hindi as their second language.
('36', 124, 7, 17, 252393) But many schools are falsely called national although they do not carry out any of the conditions laid down by the Congress.
('36', 124, 7, 18, 252518) The head master therefore deserves congratulations for his having introduced spinning and khadi.
('36', 124, 7, 19, 252615) I hope that the school board will support his effort.
('36', 124, 7, 20, 252669) He will bear in mind the fact that spinning to be successful must include carding by the boys.
('36', 124, 7, 21, 252764) Unless they know all the preceding processes, they cannot be called spinners in the true sense.

('36', 125, 3, 4, 253156) If you had given me your names and addresses, I would have sent you a full and prompt reply.
('36', 125, 3, 5, 253249) You ask me to deal with a most delicate matter in the pages of Young India.
('36', 125, 3, 6, 253325) I am sorry, I cannot do so.
('36', 125, 3, 7, 253353) If the facts are as you have stated, there is, no doubt, something radically wrong somewhere.
('36', 125, 3, 8, 253447) You have evidently written from hearsay.
('36', 125, 3, 9, 253488) You should have supplied me with facts and given me your addresses so as to enable me to correspond with you and gain supplementary information.

('36', 125, 4, 11, 253663) INDUSTRIOUS SPINNING
('36', 125, 5, 12, 253684) A correspondent writes saying that a trader’s wife in Pachora (Maharashtra) spun 34 Ibs.
('36', 125, 5, 13, 253773) of yarn in 9 months, spinning at the rate of 5 hours per day in addition to doing all her household work.
('36', 125, 5, 14, 253879) The count spun was between 7 and 8. Carding was done by the husband.
('36', 125, 5, 15, 253948) His yearly expense for clothing was Rs. 150; whereas, after the introduction of spinning in the household, it has gone down to Rs. 50. This is evidently due to getting rid of superfluous clothing.
('36', 125, 6, 16, 254145) WHY HE SPINS
('36', 125, 7, 17, 254158) A lawyer friend, whom I congratulated upon the evenness of his yarn, although he is a novice in spinning, writes:
('36', 125, 8, 18, 254272) Let me not leave you under the impression that I have taken to spinning from any patriotic or philanthrophic motives.
('36', 125, 8, 19, 254390) Seeing.
('36', 125, 8, 20, 254398) spinning constantly at .
('36', 125, 8, 21, 254423) in 1925, I started doing it with, as we lawyers usually say, entirely an ulterior object.
('36', 125, 8, 22, 254513) I regret to say I failed to achieve it and I am convi nced that however long I may continue to spin I shall not gain my object in the future.
('36', 125, 8, 23, 254655) But from the day I started spinning, I have acquired a great liking for it.
('36', 125, 8, 24, 254731) I find it is a real sedative for a troubled mind and I have therefore continued it and will continue it And as I do note like to sin just mechanically and aimle ssly, I am troublng you to help me to improve my production.

('36', 126, 11, 16, 256436) JULY 29, 1926 Of course you rarely write to me and I do likewise.
('36', 126, 11, 17, 256502) I always expect to see you in person almost every mail since someone or other continues to tell me you are coming.

('36', 127, 1, 2, 256800) copies of a book written by Teo Schreiner giving an account of Olive Schreiner.
('36', 127, 1, 3, 256880) An English friend, thinking that I would know all about this work, asks me if I know it and if I can procure it for him.
('36', 127, 1, 4, 257001) I was ashamed to tell him that I knew nothing about the work, but have promised to enquire about it and naturally thought of you.
('36', 127, 1, 5, 257131) I am immersed in my own work.
('36', 127, 1, 6, 257161) At the present moment it is all in the Ashram and about the Ashram.
('36', 127, 1, 7, 257229) I take three classes daily on Bhagavad Gita and Ramayana.
('36', 127, 1, 8, 257287) The work pleases me.
('36', 127, 1, 9, 257308) Spinning, of course, is done with religious punctuality and the balance of the time is used to editing the two papers and attending to correspondents.
('36', 127, 1, 10, 257459) We have now established a council for the management of the Ashram.

('36', 127, 5, 15, 257662) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, July 29, 1926
('36', 127, 6, 16, 257699) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('36', 127, 6, 17, 257732) 1 You will have noticed that after all I did not because I could not visit Helsingfors.
('36', 127, 6, 18, 257820) The first part of the Autobiography will be presently published in book form at the Navajivan Press.
('36', 127, 6, 19, 257921) I have no idea that there will be any very large demand for the Autobiography and I had still less idea of any Western publisher wanting to publish the book.
('36', 127, 6, 20, 258079) Several who are unknown to me have asked me for the copyright.
('36', 127, 6, 21, 258142) But I have informed them all that I am not yet ready.
('36', 127, 6, 22, 258196) Holmes is in correspondence with me about the American copyright.
('36', 127, 6, 23, 258262) But nothing is yet decided.
('36', 127, 7, 24, 258290) 1 Mukerji had acknowledged having received in America an earlier letter of Gandhiji’s and had expressed pleasure at Gandhiji’s proposed visit to Europe Also, having seen the serialization of the Autobiography in Young India, he had hoped that it would soon appear in book form and suggested that its publication abroad should be entrusted to an enterprising firm like Routledge of England and Dutton or Century or Scribner in the U.S.A.

('36', 128, 1, 2, 258771) I think prayer and meditation are of the utmost importance.
('36', 128, 2, 3, 258831) The two things I do not treat separately.
('36', 128, 2, 4, 258873) I can go without food but not without prayer.
('36', 128, 2, 5, 258919) Probably, our conceptions of prayer are different.
('36', 128, 2, 6, 258970) The prayer that we offer at the Ashram consists in reciting hymns, etc.
('36', 128, 2, 7, 259042) There is nothing in it analogous to the Christian prayers in which people ask for definite things.
('36', 128, 2, 8, 259141) The prayer is meant for daily purification.
('36', 128, 2, 9, 259185) It is to the heart and mind what a daily bath is to the body.

('36', 128, 6, 15, 259411) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, July 29, 1926
('36', 128, 7, 16, 259448) MY DEAR WALDO,
('36', 128, 8, 17, 259463) I was delighted to receive your letter.
('36', 128, 8, 18, 259503) 2 You have grown so much in size and wisdom and, perhaps, it is not proper for me to remind you that as [a] little child you were my bed fellow.
('36', 128, 9, 19, 259648) Your activities are certainly imperial.
('36', 128, 9, 20, 259688) 3 Your account of the British Fascists is very interesting.
('36', 128, 9, 21, 259748) How it would have been if you had chosen another work to describe your activities since you do not desire to [be] identified with Fascism in Italy.
('36', 128, 10, 22, 259896) 1 This had reference to Mukerji’s query on the need for meditation and prayer in daily life; he himself felt that, to ensure the maximum result of work purity of thought was essential (S.N. 10790).
('36', 128, 10, 23, 260094) 2 Waldo, Henry Polak’s son, had written on July 1 (S.N. 10777).
('36', 128, 10, 24, 260158) 3 Waldo was studying at the London School of Economics and the Middle Temple, and was taking active interest in a “Federation of British Youth” which aimed at the creation of peace through mutual understanding.
('36', 128, 10, 25, 260369) He as also a member of the “British Fascists” an organization, he explained, different from the National Fascists in Britain.

('36', 129, 1, 2, 260589) Your estimate of the modern voter is very correct.
('36', 129, 1, 3, 260640) 1 But my experience of the educated voter whom you will have in the place of the present type is no more hopeful.
('36', 129, 1, 4, 260754) Even barristers take their politics from the favourite newspaper.
('36', 129, 1, 5, 260820) The root of the evil lies in the corruption of our hearts, not necessarily in the limitations of our intellect.
('36', 129, 1, 6, 260932) But, I must not argue with you.
('36', 129, 1, 7, 260964) However I send you all my good wishes.
('36', 129, 1, 8, 261003) I wish you a long and healthy life of usefulness.

('36', 129, 6, 14, 261232) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter of the 23rd June last.
('36', 129, 6, 15, 261287) I know that my inability to visit Helsingfors was a severe disappointment to many friends.
('36', 129, 6, 16, 261378) It was not less to me.
('36', 129, 6, 17, 261401) But somehow or other the inner voice within me told me I must not go.
('36', 129, 6, 18, 261471) When Miss Nellie Lee Holt 2 comes to India, I shall be delighted to meet her.
('36', 129, 6, 19, 261549) If she comes during the year there is no difficulty because I do not propose to move out of Sabarmati till the 20th December next and, if the simple life at the Ashram is not too trying to her, she will of course stay at the Ashram.
('36', 129, 6, 20, 261782) If she wishes she may make use of the Ashram address for receiving all her letters.

('36', 130, 3, 5, 262366) MY DEAR MAUD, I have your 2nd letter 1 before me.
('36', 130, 3, 6, 262416) I assure you, I detest typewriters.
('36', 130, 3, 7, 262452) I would love to do all my correspondence in my own hand.
('36', 130, 3, 8, 262509) But, I have made a choice of the lesser evil.
('36', 130, 3, 9, 262555) I am trying to conserve all the strength I can and this I do by dictating what one might call even love letters.
('36', 130, 3, 10, 262668) You don’t generally rebuke friends through dictated letters, but I do even that.
('36', 130, 3, 11, 262749) Not much fear of my rebuking you.
('36', 130, 3, 12, 262783) You need not therefore feel nervous.
('36', 130, 3, 13, 262820) I did meet Miss Nora Karn.
('36', 130, 3, 14, 262847) 2 We had a free long chat.
('36', 130, 3, 15, 262874) I do not think that she mentioned you to me though I am not quite sure.
('36', 130, 3, 16, 262946) I hope you are now quite strong and thoroughly restored.
('36', 130, 3, 17, 263003) With love to you both.

('36', 130, 10, 25, 263146) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('36', 130, 10, 26, 263179) You will not ask me to give you anything long.
('36', 130, 10, 27, 263226) I have little leisure to spare from the work before me.
('36', 130, 10, 28, 263282) All that I can say in appreciation of the work of H. H. Shri Narayanaguruswami is to wish it every success.
('36', 130, 10, 29, 263390) Whoever lays the axe at the root of the cursed tree of untouchability thus renders a great service not merely to Hinduism but to humanity.
('36', 130, 10, 30, 263529) And I know too that nobody can better
('36', 130, 11, 31, 263567) 1 Writing on June 18, Maud had hoped Gandhiji would be able to answer in his own handwriting once again, though she “would rather have a typewritten letter than none at all” (S.N. 10769).

('36', 131, 5, 8, 264198) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI , Thursday, Asadha Vad 5, July 29, 1926
('36', 131, 6, 9, 264260) BHAI PRABHASHANKAR, I have your letter.
('36', 131, 6, 10, 264300) That you put up with your father’s misbehaviour twice does not mean that you voluntarily submitted to suffering.
('36', 131, 6, 11, 264413) Submitting to suffering does not mean condoning a misdeed.
('36', 131, 6, 12, 264472) If you had not condoned his misbehaviour on the very first occasion, the unhappy result would not have followed.
('36', 131, 6, 13, 264585) There are two ways of opposing misconduct, a non violent way and a violent way.
('36', 131, 6, 14, 264665) The method of non co operation which you have adopted on the third occasion seems perfectly right to me.
('36', 131, 6, 15, 264770) You not be afraid of criticism by society.
('36', 131, 6, 16, 264813) However, it would not be right to conceal the reason for living separately from your father; there is no need to proclaim his misdeed from the housetops, but it is not necessary, either, to conceal anything from fear of public scandal.
('36', 131, 6, 17, 265049) When we act out of regard for dharma, we should not feel any such shame.
('36', 131, 6, 18, 265122) You did right in sending your name, otherwise I would have not been able to reply to you.
('36', 131, 6, 19, 265212) I have destroyed your letter.

('36', 132, 8, 13, 265944) BHAI SHAMBHUSHANKAR, I send with this a draft for Rs 150. Please do not make it a practice to ask for a reply, as you did this time, by return of post.
('36', 132, 8, 14, 266096) A speculator may be in financial difficulties any hour and out of them the next, but one who runs a regular business can judge in advance when he will need money.

('36', 132, 8, 16, 266341) I shall send a draft on Bhavnagar if I can get one, otherwise it will be on Bombay.
('36', 132, 8, 17, 266425) Sending cash is a bother.
('36', 132, 8, 18, 266451) You will have to make a particular effort if you wish to sell Khadi.
('36', 132, 8, 19, 266520) One needs to have special qualifications for the job.
('36', 132, 8, 20, 266574) A weaver who has used mill yarn should be paid nothing; for our purposes, the piece will be of no use.
('36', 132, 8, 21, 266677) In such cases, we should be satisfied if we get back our yarn.
('36', 132, 8, 22, 266740) If you know the weaver, you and he, or, more particularly you alone, may undertake a fast, provided you can do so without anger in your heart.
('36', 132, 8, 23, 266883) But it would not be wrong if you do not do that.
('36', 132, 8, 24, 266932) A fast is not a remedy in every situation.

('36', 133, 1, 4, 267272) But it would not be wrong if you do not do that.
('36', 133, 1, 5, 267321) A fast is not a remedy in every situation.
('36', 133, 1, 6, 267364) It is only one of the many ways available for self purification.
('36', 133, 1, 7, 267429) The highest degree of purity is achieved only by gaining control over one’s thoughts.
('36', 133, 1, 8, 267515) In the final analysis, such purity is the only true purity.

('36', 133, 5, 13, 267739) MY DEAR KANITKAR, I have your letter.
('36', 133, 5, 14, 267777) I have not seen the 6th and 7th numbers of Swavalamban ( ) I suppose the paper goes to the Navajivan office.
('36', 133, 5, 15, 267886) It would be perhaps better to send the papers here.
('36', 133, 5, 16, 267938) The papers that go directly to the Navajivan office do not come here unless I specially send for them.
('36', 133, 5, 17, 268041) I looked for the Swavalamban address on the covering sheet and on the last sheet.
('36', 133, 5, 18, 268123) Not finding it there, I thought it was not given.
('36', 133, 5, 19, 268173) I now see that it is given among the advertisement sheets where one would never look.
('36', 133, 5, 20, 268259) I suppose the recent numbers do not contain advertisements at all.
('36', 133, 5, 21, 268326) But I have not got those numbers.
('36', 133, 5, 22, 268360) What I have on my desk is what you gave me in Poona.
('36', 133, 5, 23, 268413) I have meant what I have said in my message to you.
('36', 133, 5, 24, 268465) 1 I can therefore fully reciprocate your hope that, in spite of all odds against you, you will succeed in making the message of khaddar acceptable to Maharashtra.

('36', 134, 3, 5, 268900) Will you please see to the information asked for by me in the pages of Young India being supplied about spinners, etc.
('36', 134, 3, 6, 269019) You will find the items of information required in the Young India issued on.
('36', 134, 4, 7, 269097) Do also please tell me whether all the workers of the Sangh regularly wear khaddar and do sacrificial spinning for at least half an hour per day and, if so, do you keep any record of their production?
('36', 134, 4, 8, 269298) Do you test the strength of yarn from time to time?
('36', 134, 4, 9, 269350) Are the wheels of the voluntary spinners kept in perfect order?
('36', 134, 4, 10, 269414) Do you manufacture your own wheels?
('36', 134, 4, 11, 269450) Are the members of the Sangh, members of the All India Spinners’ Association?

('36', 134, 10, 19, 269857) 1 The date of the issue, which was evidently intended to be filled ill the original, was 17 6 1924. 2 This was dated July 22 (S.N. 11268).
('36', 134, 10, 20, 269996) On July 10” the Vice principal of the Prem Vidyalaya had sent Gandhiji under instructions from Gidwani, samples of spindles proposed to be manufactured.

('36', 135, 1, 2, 270191) I have now been receiving from all quarters literature on manure, not merely for grapes but for other things too.
('36', 135, 1, 3, 270305) So, what your friend will send me will be an addition.
('36', 135, 2, 4, 270360) For teaching spinning and weaving, I can send you an excellent Hindi lad 2 belonging to the U.P. He is practically illiterate.
('36', 135, 2, 5, 270487) But, he is painstaking, wants to learn Hindi more fully than he knows it and wants to learn Arithmetic also.
('36', 135, 2, 6, 270596) If he can join some class there for two hours, he will be satisfied.
('36', 135, 2, 7, 270665) You won’t have to pay anything for him beyond his living expenses, and his fare there and back.
('36', 135, 2, 8, 270761) If you think that I may send him, he will be sent immediately.
('36', 135, 2, 9, 270824) He knows carding, spinning and weaving and has been often sent as a demonstrator.
('36', 135, 2, 10, 270906) Do please tell Gangabehn to write to me and make good her threat.
('36', 135, 2, 11, 270972) When she has completed her course in Geography and History, etc., she may come here to have the finishing touch by becoming an accomplished carder, spinner, etc., so as to enable her to take up village reconstruction if she Will throw in her lot with the millions.

('36', 135, 7, 17, 271467) I am glad to learn you are better than hitherto.
('36', 135, 7, 18, 271516) You will please keep Krishnadas with you till you are so far restored as not to require any assistance whatsoever.
('36', 135, 7, 19, 271631) I have got a book by Dr. Mary Stopes 3. The article therefore that you have sent me furnishes good commentary on her work.
('36', 135, 7, 20, 271754) Indeed, marriage seems to have lost all sanctity in the West and the looseness in sexual relations is invading this poor land also.

('36', 136, 5, 11, 272560) DEAR FRIEND, Your first letter was duly received, but it was handed over to me only last week in the ordinary course.
('36', 136, 5, 12, 272678) I have made, you will see from Young India, full use of the information given by you.
('36', 136, 5, 13, 272764) 1 I do not need to write anything more about the conductof the National school under your charge.
('36', 136, 5, 14, 272862) If you continue your work in a methodical manner, it is bound to have its effect.
('36', 136, 5, 15, 272944) I am unable to make any suggestions about your diet.
('36', 136, 5, 16, 272997) You will be your own guide in that respect.
('36', 136, 5, 17, 273041) You will know exactly what is necessary.
('36', 136, 5, 18, 273082) You may reduce the quantity, restrict the variety and change it so long as your constitution responds to it without being injured.
('36', 136, 5, 19, 273213) I have not succeeded in a remarkable degree in my experiments upon myself or others in the avoidance of milk.
('36', 136, 5, 20, 273323) I therefore advise you, if you make dietetic experiments without milk and its products, to act cautiously.
('36', 136, 5, 21, 273430) The condition of your bowels and the general tone of the system will tell you what effect is produced by abstinence from milk upon your constitution.
('36', 136, 5, 22, 273580) the food you are taking is enough and contains the necessary natritious elements.

('36', 137, 3, 4, 273954) CHI, JAMNALAL, I read your letter to Devdas.
('36', 137, 3, 5, 273999) I did not expect the cloud which is now threatening you, but 1 welcome it all the same.
('36', 137, 3, 6, 274087) This is the only way in which one’s love for dharma is tested.
('36', 137, 3, 7, 274150) Send me the charge sheet against you when you get it.
('36', 137, 3, 8, 274204) I will draft a reply.
('36', 137, 3, 9, 274226) You may make any changes you like in it, our only aim being that we should maintain the utmost civility.
('36', 137, 3, 10, 274331) A community has the right to expel from its fold any member who acts against its rules.
('36', 137, 3, 11, 274419) There is nothing in all your actions for which you need feel ashamed or sorry.
('36', 137, 3, 12, 274498) Certainly, your influence in the community will diminish, and so will your capacity for getting wealth.
('36', 137, 3, 13, 274602) I don’t see anything to worry about in this.
('36', 137, 3, 14, 274647) You should not mind even if you have to take to begging.
('36', 137, 3, 15, 274704) If we can preserve our dharma, we should welcome being reduced to such a plight.
('36', 137, 3, 16, 274785) When ultimately the members of your community recognize your love for dharma and your respect for the community, they themselves will become humble.
('36', 137, 3, 17, 274934) We must bring about reforms in the affairs of communities, and by acting in this manner you will easily succeed in doing that in your community.
('36', 137, 3, 18, 275079) You should send immediately Rs. 8,000 more to enable Anna to buy a press.
('36', 137, 3, 19, 275153) He was here.
('36', 137, 3, 20, 275166) I think we should provide him with the necessary means.
('36', 137, 3, 21, 275222) If Ghanshyamdas has not returned the sum of Rs. 5,000, please remind him.
('36', 137, 3, 22, 275296) If you get it, you may send that and another Rs. 3,000, which should be deducted from the money payable in the next month.

('36', 138, 4, 7, 276202) You sent me some months ago a draft of “An Appeal to Vanik Friends”, and I had agreed to go through it.
('36', 138, 4, 8, 276306) But one thing after another turned up and I was not able to read it.
('36', 138, 4, 9, 276375) While looking through my papers today, I found this draft.
('36', 138, 4, 10, 276434) I have gone through it.
('36', 138, 4, 11, 276458) I found nothing in it which needs revision.
('36', 138, 4, 12, 276502) I am entirely with you in this movement.
('36', 138, 4, 13, 276543) I have already given you my advice, that you should see the elders in every branch of the community and try to secure their signatures.
('36', 138, 4, 14, 276679) But I have no doubt that, even if we fail in getting such signatures and only a handful from among the members of the various branches give their support, the movement is worth carrying on.
('36', 138, 4, 15, 276869) Let me know when you have obtained a few signatures on the leaflet.
('36', 138, 4, 16, 276937) After I hear from you, I will write a note on the subject in Navajivan.
('36', 138, 4, 17, 277009) I am sure you will not follow my example in the offence I have committed against you by not returning the draft soon enough.

('36', 139, 7, 16, 278176) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter and a copy of your Primer for infants for which I thank you.
('36', 139, 7, 17, 278269) I have gone through your Primer with considerable interest.
('36', 139, 7, 18, 278329) I hold strong views about juvenile literature.
('36', 139, 7, 19, 278376) In my opinion, your Primer does not exhibit any special feature except its good paper and coastlines.
('36', 139, 7, 20, 278478) I have seen most of the Urdu Primers that are available in India.
('36', 139, 7, 21, 278544) They are all more or less good, and to a certain extent, carry out your ideas.
('36', 139, 7, 22, 278623) But they are better in that they are not so expensive as yours.
('36', 139, 7, 23, 278687) should be remembered that ours is almost the poorest country in the world.
('36', 139, 7, 24, 278762) You cannot afford Primers at four annas per copy.
('36', 139, 7, 25, 278812) My own opinion is that the smaller a Primer, the better.
('36', 139, 7, 26, 278869) Little children do not need the assistance of books so much as they need the assistance of teachers.
('36', 139, 7, 27, 278970) But, as we do not have many trained teachers, Primers should be so conceived as to assist teachers rather than children.
('36', 139, 7, 28, 279091) A revolution in thought is required to frame a Primer of that character and, then too, a suitable Primer of that character can only come from the pen of an experienced teacher.
('36', 139, 7, 29, 279268) My advice to you, therefore, is really that you should study this important question of juvenile literature afresh and if you have the attainments,

('36', 141, 9, 18, 281434) A student writes: 2
('36', 141, 10, 19, 281454) Everyone is impelled sometimes to ask this question.
('36', 141, 10, 20, 281507) Nevertheless it is based on a misunderstanding.
('36', 141, 10, 21, 281555) A vow has the effect of raising us exactly because, in spite of it, there is a chance of our falling.
('36', 141, 10, 22, 281657) If there was no such danger, there would be no scope for striving.
('36', 141, 10, 23, 281724) A vow serves the same purpose as a lighthouse does.
('36', 141, 11, 24, 281776) 1 Last stage of meditation 2 The letter is not translated here.
('36', 141, 11, 25, 281840) Stating that he lacked firmness of mind, the correspondent had asked Gandhiji if there was any way by following which he would always be able to keep a vow.
('36', 142, 0, 1, 281997) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 143
('36', 142, 1, 2, 282041) If we keep our eyes fixed on it, we shall come safe through any storm.
('36', 142, 1, 3, 282112) The lighthouse itself cannot quieten the storm, yet it guides sailors caught in a storm and helps them to fight it, even so a vow is a kind of powerful force which saves a human being from the innumer able waves raging in the heart.
('36', 142, 1, 4, 282345) This being the case, no way has been found, or is likely to be found, by following which a person taking a vow can be assured that he will never fall.
('36', 142, 1, 5, 282496) And this is as it should be; otherwise the moral injunctions about truth and so on will lose the great value which is attached to them.
('36', 142, 1, 6, 282632) One has to exert oneself so much to acquire ordinary knowledge or raise a few lakhs of rupees for a fund.
('36', 142, 1, 7, 282738) There are many who do not mind risking their lives merely to be able to see a lifeless spot like the North Pole.
('36', 142, 1, 8, 282851) Why should we, then, wonder or be unhappy if we have to put in a thousand times more difficult effort in order to conquer our powerful foes such as anger, malice and so on.
('36', 142, 1, 9, 283024) Our success lies in the very struggle for this deathless glory.
('36', 142, 1, 10, 283088) The effort itself is victory.
('36', 142, 1, 11, 283118) If those who sail to the North Pole fail in their object, their effort may be considered to have been wasted, but every effort we make in our life to conquer these foes) attachment and aversion will have taken us forward.
('36', 142, 1, 12, 283340) Thus, no effort, however slight, towards such an end is ever wasted that is the Lord’s assurance.
('36', 142, 1, 13, 283438) 1 The only encouragement, therefore, which I can give this student is that he should go on striving and never lose heart.
('36', 142, 1, 14, 283560) He should never abandon the vow.
('36', 142, 1, 15, 283593) He should banish from his dictionary the word “impossible”.
('36', 142, 1, 16, 283653) If he forgets his vow at any time, he should do prayaschitta 2 and remind himself of the vow.
('36', 142, 1, 17, 283747) Every time he violates it, he should start again, and have complete confidence that he is bound at last to succeed.
('36', 142, 1, 18, 283863) No man of spiritual illumination has ever told us of his experience that untruth had ever triumphed; on the contrary every such person has unanimously proclaimed most emphatically his experience that in the end truth triumphs.
('36', 142, 1, 19, 284090) We should keep the experience of these persons in mind, and entertain no doubts of any kind when striving for a good end or be afraid to take a vow with a virtuous aim.
('36', 142, 1, 20, 284259) Pandit Rambhuj Datt Chaudhari has left us a poem in Punjabi with the following refrain: “Never accept defeat, though you lose your life.”

('36', 143, 2, 3, 284540) A reader of Navajivan writes: 1
('36', 143, 3, 4, 284572) The writer has given his name and address.
('36', 143, 3, 5, 284615) But I cannot stop the marriage.
('36', 143, 3, 6, 284647) I got the letter last week only.
('36', 143, 3, 7, 284680) I do not know the groom or the girl or any of the others concerned.
('36', 143, 3, 8, 284748) I have never been to that village.
('36', 143, 3, 9, 284783) Whether it is my timidity or discrimination, I did not have the courage to interfere in this affair, though, believing the report to be true, I did feel I should go to the village and get in touch with the old man and dissuade him or plead with the girl’s relatives.
('36', 143, 3, 10, 285050) But I could not summon the courage needed.
('36', 143, 3, 11, 285093) I, therefore, give the particulars of the case, omitting names, and should be satisfied if, reading this, people desist from such a terrible step in future.
('36', 143, 3, 12, 285250) What other reason than sensuality can there be behind such a marriage?
('36', 143, 3, 13, 285321) Dharma enjoins that one should not marry more than once.
('36', 143, 3, 14, 285378) A married woman who becomes a widow has, if she belongs to one of the so called upper castes, to remain unmarried for the rest of her life, though she may have been a mere girl when she became a widow.
('36', 143, 3, 15, 285580) But a man, no matter how old, can marry a girl of tender age; such is the intolerable, the painful position !
('36', 143, 3, 16, 285690) If there is any justification for the existence of the caste system, it should be in its ability to make such a state of affairs impossible.
('36', 143, 3, 17, 285831) If the mahajans or the young men in the communities show courage, such unhappy situations would never arise, should never arise.
('36', 143, 3, 18, 285960) Unfortunately, however, the mahajans have forgotten their duty.
('36', 143, 3, 19, 286024) Instead of acting as the guardians of the good name of their communities, they seem often to be its enemies.
('36', 143, 3, 20, 286133) Instead of being moved by a spirit of service or concern for others’ good, their members often betray selfish attitudes.
('36', 143, 3, 21, 286254) Where there are no selfish motives and there is a genuine desire to do good, courage is lacking.
('36', 143, 3, 22, 286351) The truth is that the future of the different communities, and of the country itself, depends wholly on the youth.
('36', 143, 3, 23, 286466) If they realize their duty and act in accordance with it, they can do much and make such unbecoming unions impossible.
('36', 143, 3, 24, 286585) For this, hardly anything more than educating public opinion needs to be done.
('36', 143, 3, 25, 286664) When that is done, oldmen will not have the courage to come forward to marry, nor will parents and guardians have the courage to ruin the lives of their daughters or wards.
('36', 143, 3, 26, 286837) It is amusing when old men who get married to young girls talk
('36', 143, 4, 27, 286900) 1 The letter is not translated here.
('36', 143, 4, 28, 286937) The correspondent had reported that a girl of 12 was to be married to a man aged 55 in a few days, and requested Gandhiji to use his influence to stop the marriage.

('36', 144, 1, 2, 287146) about protecting religion or cow protection or non violence.
('36', 144, 1, 3, 287207) To leave aside such ordinary but urgent reforms and indulge in big talk about swaraj and so on sounds fantastic.
('36', 144, 1, 4, 287320) Those who are eager for swaraj ought to have the strength to eradicate social evils.
('36', 144, 1, 5, 287405) The strength to win swaraj will be a sign of our good health, and no one can be considered healthy if even one limb of his is diseased.
('36', 144, 1, 6, 287541) Every young man and every well wisher of the country should bear this in mind.

('36', 144, 3, 8, 287636) Navajivan, 1 8 1926
('36', 144, 4, 9, 287656) 160. A CORRECTION
('36', 144, 5, 10, 287674) In the article captioned “Quality and Strength of Yam” which appeared in Navajivan of July 18, it was stated in the second paragraph that “the yarn received by the Mandal was from voluntary spinners”.
('36', 144, 5, 11, 287875) I had concluded this from the leaflet which I had received, but now I have come to know that the details given related to yarn produced by wage earners and not by voluntary spinners.
('36', 144, 5, 12, 288058) The reason why it is considered necessary to correct this misstatement is the fact that the yarn spun by wage earners is inferior in quality almost everywhere.
('36', 144, 5, 13, 288218) There has been unexpected improvement only in the quality of yarn produced by voluntary spinners, and that is but natural.
('36', 144, 5, 14, 288341) These spinners have a certain aim in spinning.
('36', 144, 5, 15, 288388) They feel sympathy for the poor, and that is why they take care to improve the quality of their yarn day by day.
('36', 144, 5, 16, 288501) Wage earners, on the other hand, neither have the foresight to understand their own interest nor the intelligence to learn the art of improving the quality and strength of yarn.
('36', 144, 5, 17, 288679) And, therefore, though they have been spinning for many years now, it will be a long time before they show improvement in their work.
('36', 144, 5, 18, 288813) Voluntary spinners, on the other hand, started spinning only recently, and yet they can make rapid progress if they but choose.
('36', 144, 5, 19, 288941) This is the great value of voluntary spinning and an argument to prove its necessity.

('36', 144, 6, 21, 289063) 161. MENDICANT SADHUS
('36', 144, 7, 22, 289085) The term “mendicant” would perhaps be considered derogatory to the sadhus.
('36', 144, 7, 23, 289160) But in this age sadhus mean men in ochre robes, no matter whether their hearts are of that colour, whether
('36', 145, 0, 1, 289267) 146 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 145, 1, 2, 289309) straightforward or crooked.
('36', 145, 1, 3, 289337) Really speaking a sadhu means a person with a heart which is sadhu, pure.
('36', 145, 1, 4, 289411) But we hardly ever know such sadhus, whereas we come across ochre robed sadhus, and some who are the opposite of sadhus, even begging on the streets.
('36', 145, 1, 5, 289561) I have, therefore, used the term “mendicant”‘ to describe them.
('36', 145, 1, 6, 289625) A friend writes about them: 1
('36', 145, 2, 7, 289655) This is an excellent suggestion.
('36', 145, 2, 8, 289688) But who will respond to it?
('36', 145, 2, 9, 289716) To introduce the spinning wheel amongst mendicant sadhus is much more difficult than to introduce it among the poor.
('36', 145, 2, 10, 289833) It requires changing the religious beliefs of the people.
('36', 145, 2, 11, 289891) Today the well to do believe that when they have put some money in the bag of the poor they have done a charitable deed, something meritorious.
('36', 145, 2, 12, 290035) Who will explain to them that by doing this they do not serve but harm those whom they want to help, that, in the name of dharma, they support evil and encourage hypocrisy?
('36', 145, 2, 13, 290208) If the fifty six lakh mendicant sadhus in the country should be inspired with the spirit of service and decide to maintain themselves by working, the country would get an efficient army of volunteers.
('36', 145, 2, 14, 290409) It is almost impossible to explain this to the ochre robed sadhus who go about.
('36', 145, 2, 15, 290489) There are three types of characters among them.
('36', 145, 2, 16, 290537) A large majority of them are impostors who want a well fed do nothing life.
('36', 145, 2, 17, 290613) The second type are stupid people who believe that ochre robes and work go ill together.
('36', 145, 2, 18, 290702) The third type, which is a very small group, are men of genuine renunciation, but they are so bound by tradition that they feel that a sannyasi cannot work even to serve others.
('36', 145, 2, 19, 290880) If this small group realize the importance of working, realize that, whatever may have been the practice in the past, in the present age it is necessary for sannyasis to work, as an example to other people if for no other reason, we can manage the other two groups easily enough.
('36', 145, 2, 20, 291160) But it is very difficult to convince them of this point of view.
('36', 145, 2, 21, 291225) We shall succeed in the task if we work in patience; the sannyasis will understand the truth only through experience, thatis, when the spinning wheel comes to enjoy sover eignty in the country the sannyasis will submit to its rule.
('36', 145, 2, 22, 291457) Sovereignty of the spinning wheel means the sovereignty of love, and that means an awakening of the religious spirit.
('36', 145, 2, 23, 291575) When such an awakening takes place, this small group of sannyasis will not fail to recognize it.
('36', 145, 2, 24, 291672) It is, moreover, as difficult to convince the rich as it is to
('36', 145, 3, 25, 291735) 1 The letter is not translated here.
('36', 145, 3, 26, 291772) The correspondent had suggested that Gandhiji should invite mendicant sadhus to take up spinning.
('36', 146, 0, 1, 291870) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 147
('36', 146, 1, 2, 291914) convince the sannyasis.
('36', 146, 1, 3, 291938) If the former understand their dharma and stop encouraging idleness, give work and not food, to those who beg, the empire of the spinning wheel would be established right now.
('36', 146, 1, 4, 292114) But can we expect this from the rich?
('36', 146, 1, 5, 292152) The rich themselves are, by and large, somewhat at lazy; at any rate they encourage laziness.
('36', 146, 1, 6, 292246) Whether they know it or not, their cannot but encourage idle beggars.
('36', 146, 1, 7, 292316) Hence, though the correspondent has made a good suggestion, he has not thought how difficult it would be to carry it out.
('36', 146, 1, 8, 292438) I do not mean that we should make no effort in that direction because of the difficulty.
('36', 146, 1, 9, 292527) We should indeed go on working.
('36', 146, 1, 10, 292559) Every wealthy person understanding this point and deciding to stop giving alms to the lazy, every mendicant sadhu who is not disabled taking a vow not to cat without working, benefits the country.
('36', 146, 1, 11, 292756) Wherever, therefore, something can be done in this direction, an attempt should be made.
('36', 146, 1, 12, 292845) All that I mean is that if we keep the difficulties in mind, we shall not be discouraged and will not conclude, when we fail to get immediate results, that our methods are wrong.

('36', 147, 6, 12, 294544) I do certainly feel that, not having the political following of Das or Motilal” I do not count with you in that sense, notwithstanding the personal tenderness which has always existed between us.
('36', 147, 6, 13, 294740) But is this not only stating the truth?” (S.N. 11323) 2 Vithalbhai Patel acknowledged receipt of Gandhiji’s letters of July 25 on July 28. He observed that he proposed to seek re election to the Assembly, on the expiration of his current term, “with a view to enable the Assembly to establish a convention similar to the one which obtains in the United Kingdom.
('36', 147, 6, 14, 295102) If the Assembly chooses to re elect me, I propose to continue the same arrangement regarding my contribution from my salary for a period of three years.

('36', 149, 8, 18, 298059) The one you have sent, after correcting the Hindi would be very useful.

('36', 149, 8, 20, 298189) Devdas must be at Mussoorie these days.
('36', 149, 8, 21, 298229) I have asked him to stay there as long as he wishes.
('36', 149, 8, 22, 298282) He needed peace and rest and now he has both.
('36', 149, 9, 23, 298328) I have not encouraged Visveshwar Birlaji to come here.
('36', 149, 9, 24, 298383) I advised him to seek solitude and do introspection.

('36', 150, 3, 4, 298716) BHAISHRI, I got your questions.
('36', 150, 3, 5, 298748) I think it unnecessary to discuss such questions in Navajivan.
('36', 150, 3, 6, 298811) There is certainly life in every plant.
('36', 150, 3, 7, 298851) Since plants are for man’s use, we may use twigs for brushing teeth so long as we also eat vegetable foods.
('36', 150, 3, 8, 298959) When we commit so much needless violence, why should we raise such fine issues and muddle our minds?

('36', 150, 8, 15, 299457) I had written to you specially to tell you that if you thought that the book you wrote did no good to Islam, you had better withdraw it—not for my sake or for the sake of anyone else.
('36', 150, 8, 16, 299641) I do not know if the Arya Samajists aretrying to convert some prominent Muslims.

('36', 151, 9, 12, 300817) DEVDAS, I got your letter.
('36', 151, 9, 13, 300844) I don’t know when Dr. Ansari is likely to come here.
('36', 151, 9, 14, 300897) His speech was reported in the papers and I read it.
('36', 151, 9, 15, 300950) I think the speech was an emotional outburst.
('36', 151, 9, 16, 300996) I have no doubt at all about his noble views.
('36', 151, 9, 17, 301042) But he cannot devote himself whole heartedly to anything except his professional work.
('36', 151, 9, 18, 301129) Similar is the case with Hakim Saheb.
('36', 151, 9, 19, 301167) His heart is in the right place, but he lacks the strength to sacrifice everything for the sake of the cause.
('36', 151, 9, 20, 301277) Maualana Abul Kalam Azad is indeed a Maulana.
('36', 151, 9, 21, 301323) I do not set much value on the manifesto.
('36', 151, 9, 22, 301365) A mere seven hundred cannot help our cause.
('36', 151, 9, 23, 301409) In a situation in which the truth cannot come out, what can we hope from goodness?
('36', 151, 9, 24, 301492) One cannot take interest in parliamentary activities and also work for Hindu Muslim unity, for the two are incompatible with each other.
('36', 151, 9, 25, 301629) I certainly do not want that the Maharaja or the Maharani of Nabha should do only one thing, spin on the charkha, but I think that, if they are at all likely to take up such work, it would be better and easier to teach them to spin on the takli.
('36', 151, 9, 26, 301875) If afterwards he gives up the takli, we would not feel hurt, but we would if he gave up the charkha.
('36', 152, 0, 1, 301976) VOL. 36: 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 153
('36', 152, 1, 2, 302020) think differently, however, let me know; I will send you a charkha.
('36', 152, 2, 3, 302088) The present political atmosphere is quite disgusting.
('36', 152, 2, 4, 302142) Mithubehn 1 herself had asked me to send khadi to her place.
('36', 152, 2, 5, 302203) You will easily be able to sell that quantity.
('36', 152, 2, 6, 302250) I know what prices she will pay for the different varieties of khadi.
('36', 152, 3, 7, 302320) I have already written to you about your coming here.
('36', 152, 3, 8, 302374) I certainly think you should.
('36', 152, 3, 9, 302404) But I will not object if you decide to stay on there for some time longer.
('36', 152, 3, 10, 302479) It is a wrong idea that there is no work to be done here.
('36', 152, 3, 11, 302537) There is so much of it indeed that the workers are never free.
('36', 152, 3, 12, 302600) All the same, if it is necessary also for the sake of your health to stay on there, you may certainly do so.
('36', 152, 3, 13, 302709) I had a letter from Vithalbhai.
('36', 152, 3, 14, 302741) In that at any rate he says that, if you do not go there, he will reconcile himself to your decision.

('36', 152, 7, 19, 302976) SABARMATI, Tuesday, Asadha Vad 10, August 3, 1926
('36', 152, 8, 20, 303026) BHAISHRI MOHANLAL,
('36', 152, 9, 21, 303045) We have no other yardstick with which to judge the state of national awakening except the quantity of khadi produced, the number of Antyajas educated and the number of Hindus and Muslims who live in mutual amity.
('36', 152, 9, 22, 303258) The figures for each province should be added up and the sum will indicate the position there.
('36', 152, 9, 23, 303353) If we are sincerely working for these three causes, it does not matter that the bureaucracy seems at present to become more arrogant.
('36', 152, 9, 24, 303487) Though the people may seem to have become dispirited those who are working to strengthen the three movements I have mentioned may rest fully confident that all will end well.
('36', 152, 9, 25, 303662) There are of course other fields of work too, such as municipalities, local boards, public meetings, councils, etc.
('36', 152, 9, 26, 303778) Let those who prefer to work in them do so.
('36', 152, 9, 27, 303822) Why should we envy them?
('36', 152, 9, 28, 303847) Who prevents anyone from taking up such work?

('36', 153, 1, 3, 303983) Everyone works according to his own lights.
('36', 153, 1, 4, 304027) If we, on our part, go on silently with our work and make progress in it, the atmosphere will be cleansed by and by.
('36', 153, 1, 5, 304144) Theswarajist horse is still prancing about all over the place, and we get trampled upon now and then.
('36', 153, 1, 6, 304246) When it finally allows itself to be tied to its tether, we shall be more at ease.
('36', 153, 1, 7, 304328) We should certainly hold khadi exhibitions and conduct similar activities.
('36', 153, 1, 8, 304403) We should have faith that we shall gradually succeed in them.
('36', 153, 1, 9, 304465) Shri Lakshmidas 1 has dedicated himself in all sincerity to the cause of khadi and is working in the field according to his lights and to the best of his ability.
('36', 153, 1, 10, 304628) Let the fruit of his effort be what it may.
('36', 153, 1, 11, 304672) If, instead of thinking about the whole of Gujarat or of India, each of us pays attention to his own small sphere of work and attains perfection in it, work in the other spheres is bound to show equal perfection.
('36', 153, 1, 12, 304885) And now about national schools.
('36', 153, 1, 13, 304917) If you are a practical man, am I less of one?
('36', 153, 1, 14, 304963) The suggestion which I have made is also practical.
('36', 153, 1, 15, 305015) If the pupils always lord it over us, the parents send their children as a matter of favour to us and plainly refuse to pay their fees, if the entire expenditure is met from voluntary contributions so that in effect a farce is kept up.
('36', 153, 1, 16, 305251) Rather than all this, is it not more practical that we should free ourselves from slavery to the pupils, decline to accept parents’ favour, abandon the make believe and spend the time in teaching a smaller number who are keen on learning?
('36', 153, 1, 17, 305490) Let the teach ers go round for madhukari 2 and the rest may be engaged in other productive activities.
('36', 153, 1, 18, 305593) The example of the man bitten by a snake will not apply here.
('36', 153, 1, 19, 305655) In that example, there is every hope of space being available.
('36', 153, 1, 20, 305718) In our case, on the other hand, there is hardly anything of the genuine national spirit.
('36', 153, 1, 21, 305807) Why should we deceive ourselves?
('36', 153, 1, 22, 305840) The real point in all these arguments is this—how much faith do we have in our ideas?

('36', 154, 8, 9, 306428) DEAR MR. NATARAJAN,
('36', 154, 9, 10, 306448) I have your letter.
('36', 154, 9, 11, 306468) The cutting you have sent me is substantially correct.
('36', 154, 9, 12, 306523) Vithalbhai has been sending me over Rs. 1,600 per month for the last three or four months.
('36', 154, 9, 13, 306614) I have been considering with him the advisability of publishing the news.
('36', 154, 9, 14, 306688) But, he thinks that it should not be published till after the elections.
('36', 154, 9, 15, 306761) The reasons given by him are sound and I have therefore refrained from publishing his letter and my reply.
('36', 154, 9, 16, 306868) For your own information I may state that I am not going to make use of the money on my own responsibility.
('36', 154, 9, 17, 306976) But as soon as the heat of party strife is over, I propose to invite the co operation of several leaders upon choosing the best way of utilizing Vithalbhai’s handsome gift.
('36', 154, 9, 18, 307149) He has sent me the unspent portion of the national purse presented to him.
('36', 154, 9, 19, 307224) You will please treat this matter as absolutely confidential.
('36', 154, 9, 20, 307286) Or, if you feel that you should publish something saying that The Hindu has a paragraph on the matter, you may correspond with Vithalbhai himself.
('36', 154, 9, 21, 307433) So far as the establishment of a Supreme Court is concerned, 2 I have been following the controversy.
('36', 154, 9, 22, 307535) I gathered together the papers with a view to writing upon it for Young India and then I decided not

('36', 154, 10, 24, 307766) Work suffering want of money shall try realize money and hand over to Satis Babu if you permit.
('36', 154, 10, 25, 307862) 2 What follows also constituted Gandhiji’s observations, when invited by the Indian Daily Mail to express his views on the subject, and were published by that paper on August 5. They were also reproduced in The Hindustan Times, 7 8 1926 and The Leader, 12 8 1926.

('36', 155, 1, 3, 308219) The objections raised by distinguished lawyers have made absolutely no appeal to me.
('36', 155, 1, 4, 308304) Indeed it has been a painful surprise to me to observe the opposition to Sir Hari Singh’s 1 very mild and very innocent proposal.
('36', 155, 1, 5, 308434) But we have lost all confidence in ourselves.
('36', 155, 1, 6, 308480) I have some little experience of Privy Council cases.
('36', 155, 1, 7, 308534) And, it is my firm belief that the members of the Privy Council are not free from political bias and on highly intricate matters of custom, in spite of all their labours they often make egregious blunders.

('36', 155, 7, 14, 308948) DEAR FRIEND, I got your letter sent with Nanabhai.
('36', 155, 7, 15, 308999) If you can live only on milk, by all means do that, but the milk should be fresh and unboiled.
('36', 155, 7, 16, 309094) I did make the experiment in jail, and would have found no difficulty in living on milk alone.
('36', 155, 7, 17, 309189) But the stomach had been used to fruitfor 30 years and so I lost three pounds in a week.
('36', 155, 7, 18, 309278) I was, therefore, forced to start eating fruit again.
('36', 155, 7, 19, 309332) You may live on milk alone if you don’t require fruit and if you get regular motions without having to take medicines for the purpose.
('36', 155, 7, 20, 309467) I got the books you returned.
('36', 155, 7, 21, 309497) I had asked you to send them back only after you had read them.
('36', 155, 7, 22, 309561) I am strongly of the view that you should not change your diet even when you go to England.
('36', 155, 7, 23, 309653) I am sure that if you stick to milk and such fruits as you can digest, you will

('36', 156, 1, 5, 310123) That is unavoidable in your profession.
('36', 156, 1, 6, 310163) Your suggestion about the Congress President is perfectly right, but there are many complications about it.

('36', 156, 6, 12, 310561) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, Wednesday, Asadha Vad 11, August 4, 1926
('36', 156, 7, 13, 310625) BHAISHRI KAKA, I have your letter I will publish the article 1 which you have sent to Mahadev.
('36', 156, 7, 14, 310720) I intend to add” nearly” in the last sentence.
('36', 156, 8, 15, 310767) Foreign cloth should never be used at all, but in cities the use of motor transport may not be an evil, it may be good.
('36', 156, 8, 16, 310887) If, for instance, there is a fire at a far end of the town, a motor lorry may be more useful in reaching the place.
('36', 156, 8, 17, 311003) Or, when we see in Calcutta, and even in Bombay, draught animals made to haul excessive loads during the fiercenoon day heat, the advantage of motor transport becomes plain enough.
('36', 156, 8, 18, 311184) Moreover in an age of railways and cities, we can change things only if we oppose the very existence of cities, if we can at all do so.
('36', 156, 8, 19, 311320) And now about collective farming.
('36', 156, 8, 20, 311354) That human civilization was due to agriculture is a relative truth; in other words, man advanced from the hunter’s stage to the agricultural stage.
('36', 156, 8, 21, 311502) The next stage, now, is not that of collective farms but of orchards.
('36', 156, 8, 22, 311572) There will be even

('36', 157, 1, 2, 311858) greater stability when we arrive at that stage.
('36', 157, 1, 3, 311906) Our relations with the world will become purer than at present, and people will have to labour much less in growing fruit trees than they do in agriculture and they would have some peace too.
('36', 157, 1, 4, 312098) Moreover, as vegetarian food is spiritually beneficial, compared with flesh food, so fruit diet will be still more beneficial.
('36', 157, 1, 5, 312225) Trees, again, make rainfall more regular and are also more independent of rains than grain fields.
('36', 157, 1, 6, 312324) Thus fruit diet has numerous economic, political and spiritual benefits.
('36', 157, 1, 7, 312397) But I am afraid we shall not have the privilege of introducing this reform, though of course I have still not given up hope completely.
('36', 157, 1, 8, 312533) If I meet a chemist with a spiritual vision, I would immediately resume the experiment which I had to abandon.
('36', 157, 1, 9, 312644) If you can interest that Lonavala doctor, he may perhaps carry out experiments.
('36', 157, 1, 10, 312724) I understand what you say about your health.
('36', 157, 1, 11, 312769) Try one thing more in your diet experiments.
('36', 157, 1, 12, 312814) You may drink fresh milk of cow or buffalo, if you can be sure of proper cleanliness having been observed in milking.
('36', 157, 1, 13, 312932) You should watch the effect.
('36', 157, 1, 14, 312961) If it is beneficial, you may continue taking the milk.
('36', 157, 1, 15, 313016) The vaid says that the body gets the finest vitamins from such milk, which are destroyed when the milk is heated.
('36', 157, 1, 16, 313130) These vitamins are considered essential for health.
('36', 157, 1, 17, 313182) One doctor Talwalkar has done a good study of this subject.
('36', 157, 1, 18, 313242) If necessary, you may correspond with him.
('36', 157, 1, 19, 313285) My health has not suffered at all.
('36', 157, 1, 20, 313320) I tried to live only on fruit, but resumed milk because I found that I was losing weight.
('36', 157, 1, 21, 313410) The fruits contained no seeds, of course.
('36', 157, 1, 22, 313452) I don’t remember anything about the three stories.
('36', 157, 1, 23, 313503) If you help me, I may be able to refresh my memory and try to read them.
('36', 157, 1, 24, 313576) Left to myself, I am not likely to have the courage or enthusiasm to take up anything to read.

('36', 158, 1, 5, 314368) It is not at all true that I have started teaching the Bible in the Vidyapith.
('36', 158, 1, 6, 314447) How can I help if the papers do not leave me alone?
('36', 158, 1, 7, 314499) They do not let me do anything in peace.
('36', 158, 1, 8, 314540) If my peace of mind depended on external circumstances, they would have driven me mad long ago.
('36', 158, 1, 9, 314636) I asked the students to choose in what manner they would like me to spend one hour with them every week.
('36', 158, 1, 10, 314741) They have decided to put questions to me every Saturday.
('36', 158, 1, 11, 314798) If any time was left after answering their questions, I might read the New Testament with them.
('36', 158, 1, 12, 314894) On the first Saturday, the one hour was over before all the questions could be answered.
('36', 158, 1, 13, 314983) I don’t know what will happen next time.
('36', 158, 1, 14, 315024) Apart from this, I should certainly like the students to learn to think about religious issues.

('36', 158, 1, 16, 315174) It was only yesterday I got the report of the committee appointed to inquire into the running of the Vidyapith.

('36', 159, 7, 11, 316621) The problem of inducing paid spinners to improve their yarn and weavers to take up hand spun yarn is causing difficulty every where.
('36', 159, 7, 12, 316754) Patience and perseverance combined with acquisition of scien tific knowledge about the methods of improving handspun yarn is the only remedy.
('36', 159, 7, 13, 316896) Weavers will readily take up hand spun yarn if it is even, strong and properly hanked.
('36', 159, 7, 14, 316983) They have no time for thinking of patriotism, all of their time being used up in keeping the wolf from the door.
('36', 159, 7, 15, 317096) They, therefore, seek the easiestwork.
('36', 159, 7, 16, 317135) And unless we make weaving of hand spun yarn as easy as that of mill spun, we must not expect many weavers to take it up.
('36', 159, 7, 17, 317257) The secret, therefore, lies in hand spun yarn being improved in quality.
('36', 159, 7, 18, 317330) And, this is only possible, when we have an army of expert voluntary spinners who know all about spinning, who know a good spinning wheel from bad, and who, having love for the semi starved spinners, will go to them, patiently reason with them and finally steel into their hearts, so as to induce the spinners to make the necessary improvement in their wheels and understand the method of drawing finer, stronger and more even yarn.
('36', 159, 7, 19, 317763) The thing is difficult.
('36', 159, 7, 20, 317787) It is not impossible.
('36', 159, 7, 21, 317809) But, the difficulty of the task and the extent it covers make it a matter of first class national importance.
('36', 159, 7, 22, 317919) And, as it admits of immediate returns, and therefore its accomplishment is within reach, it does not need unlimited capital.

('36', 160, 1, 2, 318347) 180. ‘TOWARDS MORAL BANKRUPTCY’ VI
('36', 160, 2, 3, 318382) After having insisted on chastity before and during marriage and shown by overwhelming proof that not only is self restraint not impossible, not harmful, but perfectly possible and wholly beneficial both to the mind and the body, M. Bureau devotes a chapter to the value and possibility of perpetual continence.
('36', 160, 2, 4, 318694) The following opening paragraph is worth reproducing:
('36', 160, 3, 5, 318748) In the first rank of these liberators, these heroes of the true sexual emancipation, it is only right to name the young men and women who, the better to devote themselves to the service of a great cause, choose to remain all their life in chastity, and renounce the joys of marriage.
('36', 160, 3, 6, 319032) The reasons for their resolve vary according to circumstances: one feels it a duty to remain with an infirm father or mother; another takes the place, to orphaned brother and sisters, of the departed parents; another desires to devote himself or herself entirely to the service of science or art, of the poor or the sick, or to a work of moral education or of prayer.
('36', 160, 3, 7, 319400) Similarly, the merit of the voluntary sacrifice may be greater or less; some, thanks to the benefits of a wise protective education and the practice of a good moral hygiene, are almost without sensual temptations; other, more advanced in the path of virtue, have succeeded, it may be at the cost of sharp conflicts of which they alone know the hardness, in mastering the beast and taming the flesh.
('36', 160, 3, 8, 319799) On any supposition, the final resolve is the same: the men and women have been led to think that the best way for them to serve is not to marry; and they have entered into an engagement, it may be with themselves, it may be with God, to remain in the perfect chastity of the celibate life.
('36', 160, 3, 9, 320089) However definite and undoubted may be the duty of marriage, as we shall see under certain circumstances, all these resolutions are legitimate, because they are inspired by a noble and generous purpose.” Painting is a jealous mistress who suffers no rival,” replied Michael Angelo when marriage was suggested to him; and how many after him have had a like experience!
('36', 160, 4, 10, 320456) I can corroborate this testimony from the experience of European friends of almost every description given by M. Bureau, friends who exercised perpetual restraint.
('36', 160, 4, 11, 320620) It is only in India that from childhood we must hear of marriages.
('36', 160, 4, 12, 320687) Parents have no other thought, no other ambition save that of seeing their children well married and provided for.
('36', 160, 4, 13, 320802) The one thing brings premature decay of mind and body and the other induces idleness and often makes of one a parasite; We exaggerate the difficulty of chastity and voluntary poverty and impute extraordinary merit to them, reserve them for
('36', 161, 0, 1, 321042) 162 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 161, 1, 2, 321084) mahatmas and yogis and rule the latter out of ordinary life, forgetting that real mahatmaship and yoga are unthinkable in a society where the ordinary level is brought down to the mudbank.
('36', 161, 1, 3, 321273) On the principle that evil, like the hare, travels faster than good which like the tortoise, though steady, goes slow, voluptuousness of the West comes to us with lightning speed and with all its variegated enchantment dazzles and blinds us to the realities of life.
('36', 161, 1, 4, 321540) We are almost ashamed of chastity and are in danger of looking upon self imposed poverty as a crime in the fate of the Western splendour that descends upon us from minute to minute through the cable and day to day through the steamers that discharge their cargo on our shores.
('36', 161, 1, 5, 321817) But the West is not wholly what we see in India.
('36', 161, 1, 6, 321866) Even as the South African Whites ill judge us when they judge us through the Indian settlers, so shall we ill judge the West through the human and the other western cargo that delivers itself to us every day.
('36', 161, 1, 7, 322075) There is in the West a small but inexhaustible reservoir of purity and strength which those who have eyes of penetration may see beneath the deceptive surface.
('36', 161, 1, 8, 322235) Throughout the European desert there are oases from which those who will may drink the purest water of life.
('36', 161, 1, 9, 322344) Chastity and voluntary poverty are adopted without brag, without bluster, and in all humility by hundreds of men and women, often for no other than the allsufficing cause of service of some dear one or of the country.
('36', 161, 1, 10, 322562) We often prate about spirituality as if it had nothing to do with the ordinary affairs of life and had been reserved for anchoriteslost in the Himalayan forests or concealed in some inaccessible Himalayan cave.
('36', 161, 1, 11, 322773) Spirituality that has no bearing on and produces no effect on everyday life is ‘an airy nothing’.
('36', 161, 1, 12, 322871) Let young men and women for whose sake Young India is written from week to week know that it is their duty if they would purify the atmosphere about them and shed their weakness, to be and remain chaste and know too that it is not so difficult as they have been taught to imagine.
('36', 161, 2, 13, 323152) Let us further listen to M. Bureau:
('36', 161, 3, 14, 323188) In proportion as it (modern sociology) follows the evolution of our manners, and as methodical study digs more deeply the soil of social realities, the better is the value perceived of the help which the practice of perpetual chastity brings to the great work of the discipline of the senses.
('36', 161, 3, 15, 323481) If marri age is the normal state of life for the immense majority of people, it cannot be that all can, or ought to marry.
('36', 161, 3, 16, 323604) Even putting aside the exceptional vocations of which we have just spoken, there are at least three classes of celibates who cannot be blamed for not being married: the young people of both sexes who
('36', 162, 0, 1, 323804) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 163
('36', 162, 1, 2, 323849) for professional or economic reasons think it a duty to defer their marriage; the people who are involuntarily condemned to celibacy because they cannot find a suitable partner; finally, those who ought to abstain from marriage in consequence of their physiological defects that could be transmitted, and in some who are strictly bound to renounce all idea of it.
('36', 162, 1, 3, 324213) Is it not evident, then, that the renunciation made by these people, doubly necessary both for their own happiness and the interests of society, will be rendered so much the less painful and so much the more cheerful, because they will find beside them others who, in full possession of their physical and intellectual vigour and sometimes with abundant means have declared their firm resolution to remain celibate all their lives?
('36', 162, 1, 4, 324645) These voluntary and choice celibates, who have willed to consecrate themselves to God without reserve, to prayer and to the training of the souls, declare that in their eyes celibacy, far from being a reduced condition of life, is on the contrary a superior state, in which man asserts, in its plenitude, the mastery of the will over instinct.
('36', 162, 1, 5, 324989) The author says:
('36', 162, 2, 6, 325006) To young people of both the sexes, who are still too young to marry perpetual cilibacy shows that it is possible to pass one’s youth chastely; to the married it recalls the duty which lies upon them to maintain exact discipline in their conjugal discipline and never to allow a consideration of self interest however legitimate it be in itself, to prevail over the higher demands of moral generosity.
('36', 162, 2, 7, 325407) Foerster says:
('36', 162, 3, 8, 325422) The vow of the voluntary celibate far from degrading marriage, is on the contrary the best support of the sanctity of the conjugal bond, since it represents in a concrete form man’s freedom in the face of the pressure of his nature.
('36', 162, 3, 9, 325655) It acts like a conscience with regard to passing whims and sensual assault.
('36', 162, 3, 10, 325731) Celibacy is also a protection to marriage in the sense that its existence prevents married people from looking upon themselves in their mutual relations as mere slaves to obscure natural forces, and it leads them to take openly in the face of nature, the position of free beings who are capable of mastery.
('36', 162, 3, 11, 326038) Those who scoff at perpetual celibacy as unnatural or impossible do not know really what they are doing.
('36', 162, 3, 12, 326143) They fail to see that the line of thought which makes them talk as they do must necessarily lead, by strict logic, to prostitution and polygamy.
('36', 162, 3, 13, 326288) If the demand of nature is irresistible, how can a chaste life be required of married people?
('36', 162, 3, 14, 326382) And lastly, they forget the great number of marriages in which, it may be for several months or years, or even for life, one of the spouses is condemned to a real celibacy by the sickness or other disability of the partner.
('36', 162, 3, 15, 326606) For this reason alone, true monogamy rises or falls with the esteem that is paid to celibacy.

('36', 163, 2, 3, 326788) Sir Ganga Ram has published a valuable table giving the number of widows throughout India with subsidiary tables for each province.
('36', 163, 2, 4, 326920) The tables should be in the hands of every reformer.
('36', 163, 2, 5, 326973) Not many will agree with Sir Ganga Ram about the order, in which, according to him, reform should proceed.
('36', 163, 2, 6, 327080) He gives the order thus: 1st.
('36', 163, 2, 7, 327110) Social Reformation.
('36', 163, 2, 8, 327130) Economic Reformation.
('36', 163, 2, 9, 327152) Swaraj or Political Emancipation.
('36', 163, 2, 10, 327186) Not so thought Sir Ganga Ram’s predecessors every whit as keen social reformers as himself.
('36', 163, 2, 11, 327278) Ranade, Gokhale, Chanda varkar considered swaraj to be as important as social reform.
('36', 163, 2, 12, 327364) Lokamanya Tilak felt no less for social reform.
('36', 163, 2, 13, 327412) But he and his perdecessors recognized and realized the necessity of all branches of reform proceeding side by side.
('36', 163, 2, 14, 327529) Indeed Lokamanya and Gokhale considered political reform to be of greater urgency than the other.
('36', 163, 2, 15, 327627) They held that our political serfdom incapacitated us for any other work.
('36', 163, 2, 16, 327701) The fact is that political emancipation means the rise of mass consciousness.
('36', 163, 2, 17, 327779) It cannot come without affecting all the branches of national activity.
('36', 163, 2, 18, 327851) Every reform means an awakening.
('36', 163, 2, 19, 327884) Once truly awakened the nation will not be satisfied with reform only in one department of life.
('36', 163, 2, 20, 327981) All movements must therefore proceed, everyone proceeding simultaneously.
('36', 163, 2, 21, 328055) But one need not quarrel 1 with Sir Ganga Ram about his arrangement of the order of the needed reform.
('36', 163, 2, 22, 328158) One cannot but acknowledge his zeal for social reform even though one may not agree with his political or economic panaceas.
('36', 163, 2, 23, 328283) The figures he has given us are truly appalling.” Who will not weep”, he asks,” over the figures which show the misery caused by child marriages and enforced widowhood?” Here are the figures of Hindu widows according to the census of 1921:
('36', 163, 3, 24, 328523) Widows of ages up to 5 11,892
('36', 163, 4, 25, 328553) Widows from 5 to 10 85,037

('36', 164, 2, 3, 328737) 3,29,076
('36', 164, 3, 4, 328746) The figures are also given for the two previous censuses.
('36', 164, 3, 5, 328804) The total of 1921 is a triple higher than for the two decades.
('36', 164, 3, 6, 328867) The widows of the other classes are also given.
('36', 164, 3, 7, 328915) They only demonstrate still further the enormity of the wrong done to the Hindu girl widows.
('36', 164, 3, 8, 329008) We cry out for cow protection in the name of religion, but we refuse protection to the human cow in the shape of the girl widow.
('36', 164, 3, 9, 329137) We would resent 1 force in religion.
('36', 164, 3, 10, 329174) But in the name of religion we force widowhood upon our three lacs of girl widows who could not understand the import of the marriage ceremony.
('36', 164, 3, 11, 329318) To force widowhood upon little girls is a brutal crime for which we Hindus are daily paying dearly.
('36', 164, 3, 12, 329418) If our conscience was truly awakened there would be no marriage before 15, let alone widowhood, and we would declare that these three lacs of girls were never religiously married.
('36', 164, 3, 13, 329598) There is no warrant in any Shastra for such widowhood.
('36', 164, 3, 14, 329653) Voluntary widowhood consciously adopted by a woman who has felt the affection of a partner adds grace and dignity to life, sanctifies the home and uplifts religion itself.
('36', 164, 3, 15, 329825) Widowhood imposed by religion or custom is an unbearable yoke and defiles the home by secret vice and degrades religion.
('36', 164, 4, 16, 329946) And does not this Hindu widowhood stink in one’s nostrils when one thinks of old and diseased men over 50 taking or rather purchasing girl wives sometimes one on the top of another?
('36', 164, 4, 17, 330128) So long as we have thousands of widows in our midst we are sitting on a mine which may explode at any moment.
('36', 164, 4, 18, 330238) If we would be pure, if we would save Hinduism, we must rid ourselves of this poison of enforced widowhood.
('36', 164, 4, 19, 330346) The reform must begin by those who have girl widows taking courage in both their hands and seeing that the child widows in their charge are duly and well married—not re married.
('36', 164, 4, 20, 330524) They were never really married.

('36', 165, 1, 7, 331043) of spinning wheels per school 10 Present average monthly out put of yarn 30 seers Average count of yarn 10 Total quantity of cloth woven from the yarn 1,000 yards Total output of yarn from the commencement 4 mds.

('36', 165, 1, 9, 331600) 10 wheels per school cannot be expected to give much for the simple reason that they are too few to be shared by all the children every day.
('36', 165, 1, 10, 331741) I would, therefore, commend to the Municipality the introduction of the takli and it will be found that the output can be easily trebled without any substantial increase in the expenses.
('36', 165, 1, 11, 331928) There would be no repairs required and every rupee saved.
('36', 165, 1, 12, 331986) Every minute utilized will be so much added to the income.
('36', 165, 1, 13, 332045) The Banaras Municipality has led the way in hand spinning.
('36', 165, 1, 14, 332104) I hope that it will not hesitate to introduce a reform which experience has proved is most desirable so far as schools are concerned.

('36', 166, 3, 4, 332383) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('36', 166, 3, 5, 332416) Here are my answers to your questions: (1) The aim of life should be self purification.
('36', 166, 3, 6, 332504) (2) The voidness of life is removed by filling it with self less service.
('36', 166, 3, 7, 332578) (3) Every wrong must carry its penalty.
('36', 166, 3, 8, 332618) But when a person attains sinlessness, there is no consciousness of penalty because there is no consciousness of person sinned.
('36', 166, 3, 9, 332746) You have to cease to think of the girl you have wronged and, that you will do when you appreciate the measure of the wrong and understand that she must be in the place of a blood sister.
('36', 166, 3, 10, 332933) (4) In any case, there must be no thought of marriage so long as you think of the girl.
('36', 166, 3, 11, 333021) (5) Selfishness can only be removed by devoted service of others without any expectations of reward.
('36', 166, 3, 12, 333122) (6) Animal passion can be restrained by realizing that we are men and not brutes.
('36', 166, 3, 13, 333204) We are men destined to control our passions because we have outlived the mere animal life.
('36', 166, 3, 14, 333295) (7) Concentration comes by devoting oneself to some single pure act of service.
('36', 166, 3, 15, 333375) (8) One can learn to endure sorrows and [mis]fortunes by realizing that these are the common lot of all mortals.
('36', 166, 3, 16, 333488) The wonder is that we have few[er] than many others.

('36', 167, 9, 18, 334553) My correspondence is so vast, numerous that I can give no such promise.
('36', 167, 9, 19, 334625) All that I can say, therefore, is that no one will see your letter except those who handle letters addressed to me.
('36', 167, 9, 20, 334741) I can say this because I always destroy letters like yours.

('36', 168, 3, 7, 335529) You will see the table I have published in Young India.
('36', 168, 3, 8, 335585) I want to make that table exhaustive.

('36', 168, 8, 15, 335936) DEAR SATIS BABU, I have seen the correspondence about Utkal.
('36', 168, 8, 16, 335997) As soon as Niranjan Babu’s letter was received arrangements were made to send him Rs. 5,000. 1 He must have now got them already.
('36', 168, 8, 17, 336127) You are certainly not relieved of your charge about Utkal.
('36', 168, 8, 18, 336186) What did happen was that as a result of the papers sent by Niranjan Babu, I asked Narayandas to carry on correspondence with him so as to elucidate further facts and learn more about the position.
('36', 168, 8, 19, 336383) But there is no question of managing Utkal directly from here.
('36', 168, 8, 20, 336446) When he returns, I may write further in the matter.
('36', 168, 8, 21, 336498) Meanwhile, I remember one condition of his which appealed to me.

('36', 169, 1, 5, 336963) As a matter of form, I think Mr. Mavalankar is right and, seeing that the security is given, it should be complete.
('36', 169, 1, 6, 337079) Will there be any difficulty about getting possession of the shares?
('36', 169, 1, 7, 337148) I enclose a copy of Mr. Mavalankar’s letter 1 for your information.

('36', 170, 7, 12, 338661) The spindles also have now been received.
('36', 170, 7, 13, 338703) The spindles are not good.
('36', 170, 7, 14, 338730) They bend at the end under the slightest pressure.
('36', 170, 7, 15, 338781) It is such a delicate thing that even whilst filing, it becomes heated and it requires, therefore, cooling from time to time.
('36', 170, 7, 16, 338907) I hope you have not got the specimen spindles.
('36', 170, 7, 17, 338954) It will be a great thing if the workshop there can turn out such spindles.
('36', 170, 7, 18, 339029) There are pending orders for several thousands.
('36', 170, 7, 19, 339077) The specimens you have sent are also not true.
('36', 170, 7, 20, 339124) If a spindle is not absolutely correct, it wobbles as it revolves and wobbling is fatal to good spinning.

('36', 171, 3, 5, 339579) Sometimes it is difficult to know one’s dharma.
('36', 171, 3, 6, 339627) After becoming member of the managing committee of a bank, you can do nothing outside rules and regulations of the bank.
('36', 171, 3, 7, 339748) I am sure there is no rule, there cannot be any, that money cannot be advanced to a person following a particular profession or belonging to a particular faith.
('36', 171, 3, 8, 339909) What has occurred suggests, however, that you should not be member of an institution like a bank.
('36', 171, 3, 9, 340007) If you are, you certainly share in the wrongs committed in its running.
('36', 171, 3, 10, 340079) My view isthat, so long as you are member of a bank, you should think only of the safety of the bank’s money in casting your vote without taking into account the religion and profession of the applicant.

('36', 171, 10, 18, 340577) Credit to my account the time you would save in reading the letter; I had stated, in your own words, a distinction made by you.
('36', 171, 10, 19, 340705) Even if you make it, I have no fear that you will neglect my work.
('36', 171, 10, 20, 340772) For the work of the Vidyapith is not mine alone; it is as much the work of you all as it is mine.

('36', 172, 1, 3, 341113) I don’t see any difference in the new solution which you now suggest.
('36', 172, 1, 4, 341183) I fully endorse your view that a teacher can propagate spinning only in his capacity as teacher.
('36', 172, 1, 5, 341280) You may look upon khadi and the allied activities as the beginning of education; its end is reached only when we attain moksha 1. I was the person who suggested that Narahari 2 should go to Surat and it was he who had asked that a limit be set for the period of his stay there.
('36', 172, 1, 6, 341558) If now he decides to stay on, not because I want him to do so but of his own free will, and identifies himself with the school, I will not oppose him at all.
('36', 172, 1, 7, 341716) My opposition is because of his restlessness.
('36', 172, 1, 8, 341762) He soon tires of anything which he takes up, if hiswork does not yield tangible results.
('36', 172, 1, 9, 341851) We should not, because he is tired of it, let him give up the work 3 in Sarbhon.
('36', 172, 1, 10, 341932) Narahari is free to do what he thinks best after taking into consideration all these factors.
('36', 172, 1, 11, 342026) It has not occurred to me even in my dreams that he should not remain in charge of the school at Surat.
('36', 172, 1, 12, 342130) I merely wish that he should not fail in his dharma.

('36', 172, 7, 18, 342359) I have your letter.
('36', 172, 7, 19, 342379) Your idea of paying a visit to Bombay in September appears inverted thinking to me.
('36', 172, 7, 20, 342463) Instead, why doesn’t Dr. Jivraj go there when he has the time?
('36', 172, 7, 21, 342526) I think it is desirable not to take any risk when you have improved so much.
('36', 172, 7, 22, 342603) Pyarelal, like Cassius, thinks too much.
('36', 172, 7, 23, 342644) Hence it will be difficult for him to acquire a pink complexion.
('36', 172, 7, 24, 342709) It is enough if he can keep himself fit.
('36', 172, 7, 25, 342750) I know this is the best season in Panchgani.
('36', 172, 7, 26, 342795) Let Pyarelal benefit from it as much as he can.

('36', 173, 5, 12, 343610) In what way can I help one who enjoys the patronage of Swamiji 1 himself?
('36', 173, 5, 13, 343684) The persons whom I approach for help in the cause of the depressed classes are the same to whom Swamiji goes.

('36', 173, 10, 22, 344126) The word khaddar certainly does not include all other home industry.
('36', 173, 10, 23, 344195) But it is not antagonistic to them.
('36', 173, 10, 24, 344231) Spinning by way of sacrifice is undoubtedly necessary for everyone, no matter

('36', 174, 1, 3, 344443) A man who uses his leisure time in spinning by way of sacrifice certainly does better than the one who uses that time for engaging in an industry which gives him more money, because, in the latter case there is no sacrifice and, therefore, no identification with the poor.

('36', 174, 3, 10, 344968) If you carry sterilized milk with you and see that it is kept in the ice chamber, I am sure it will not go bad.
('36', 174, 3, 11, 345080) Moreover, the ship will be stopping at ports on the way.
('36', 174, 3, 12, 345137) You can get a fresh stock of milk at every such port.
('36', 174, 3, 13, 345191) The ship authorities will certainly let you carry two or three goats.
('36', 174, 3, 14, 345261) In some ships they carry even cows.
('36', 174, 3, 15, 345297) When the proposal of my visit to Finland was being considered, 2 we had certainly thought of taking goats.
('36', 174, 3, 16, 345404) Besides, you get Nestles’ condensed milk, both sweet and plain.
('36', 174, 3, 17, 345468) You can live even on that.
('36', 174, 3, 18, 345495) Failing every thing else, there is Horlicks’ malted milk, which is but dried milk.
('36', 174, 3, 19, 345578) It is available in the form of powder and can safely be taken in place of fresh milk.
('36', 174, 3, 20, 345664) Besides, the worst coming to the worst, if the goat dies one day through an accident, the Horlicks bottle breaks and the contents of the Nestle tin turn out to be bad, you can certainly live on fruit on that day.
('36', 174, 3, 21, 345877) If somehow you can keep up this regimen, I have no doubt that your health will be completely restored.
('36', 174, 3, 22, 345980) We can discuss this further if you can break journey and see me on your way [to Bombay].

('36', 177, 2, 3, 349032) Kaka Saheb writes: 1
('36', 177, 3, 4, 349053) Kaka Saheb’s argument deserves serious attention, especially these days when, almost every week, Navajivan carries an article on the best means of protecting cows.
('36', 177, 3, 5, 349217) Just as, if we stop consuming milk, however hard we strike in the cause of cow protection, people will never respond to our efforts, so also, if we stop utilizing the services of bullocks for agricultural and other purposes, it will be impossible to protect them.
('36', 177, 3, 6, 349481) No person in this world has found it possible to maintain something which is a source of constant economic loss.
('36', 177, 3, 7, 349594) That is why I have many times suggested that if dharma and economic interests cannot be reconciled, either the conception of that dharma is false or the economic interest takes the form of unmitigated selfishness, and does not aim at collective welfare.
('36', 177, 3, 8, 349848) True dharma always promotes legitimate economic pursuits.
('36', 177, 3, 9, 349906) For imperfect man, this is a fine test of whether what purports to be dharma is true dharma.
('36', 177, 3, 10, 349999) In big cities cows and buffaloes have become a burden from the point of view of general economy and that is why their slaughter is increasing day by day.
('36', 177, 3, 11, 350153) If we do not know the right use of cows and buffaloes in big cities, do what we will, we shall never be able to save them—let no one have any doubt about this.
('36', 177, 3, 12, 350313) At the moment it seems that we have reached a stage when we simply cannot do without railways.
('36', 177, 3, 13, 350408) If, however, we realize that railways have not been on the whole a blessing to the country we can restrict their use when we get power.
('36', 177, 3, 14, 350544) Similarly, even if we cannot banish the motor car altogether, we must limit the sphere of its use.
('36', 177, 3, 15, 350643) Everyone should feel that we simply cannot have our fields ploughed by machine and leave the bullocks entirely at the mercy of human beings.
('36', 177, 3, 16, 350784) The economic structure of the country will be worthy of our admiration and will endure only if it is in keeping with the conditions in the country.
('36', 177, 3, 17, 350932) Our wisdom and our culture will be judged from our ability to plan an economy which takes into account the conditions prevailing in the country.

('36', 178, 1, 2, 351430) 201. NATIONAL SCHOOLS
('36', 178, 2, 3, 351452) An experienced worker writes: 1
('36', 178, 3, 4, 351484) Let us first examine the analogy of the snake bite before considering the argument advanced.
('36', 178, 3, 5, 351577) An analogy is always a little dangerous because two things are rarely, if ever, similar in all respects.
('36', 178, 3, 6, 351682) And if there is absence of similarity in the essentials, the analogy cannot hold and becomes misleading.
('36', 178, 3, 7, 351787) In snake bite, there is hope of revival, the doctor has not declared the person dead; and if the body is cremated there can be no question of removing the poison.
('36', 178, 3, 8, 351950) Therefore it is sometimes considered advisable to keep the body for two or three days for we do not have the power to recreate a body which has been burnt.
('36', 178, 3, 9, 352106) But in the case of the so called national school which I want should either be reformed or closed down, there will not be any of these three considerations to be taken into account, that is to say, there will be no possibility of its acquiring a national character.
('36', 178, 3, 10, 352372) It is desirable that a school which has been pronounced dead after examination by a doctor and which being the creation of man can be revived, should be closed down.
('36', 178, 3, 11, 352538) The continuance of these schools results in the spread of falsehood among us; money collected in the name of national schools is spent on these pseudo national schools which is a betrayal of the trust of the donors; and the true national schools suffer in the estimation of the people because they are led to judge them from what they see in these pseudo national schools.
('36', 178, 3, 12, 352911) Those who collect funds for them lose their credit and money being received in the name of national schools stops coming in.
('36', 178, 3, 13, 353036) If there are to be such undesirable results, it is better to take up a real national school, however small, and concentrate all our attention on it to make it a success.
('36', 178, 3, 14, 353206) It would behove us and there will be truth and practical sense in it.
('36', 178, 3, 15, 353276) Just as no construction work is possible out of bricks made of sand spice together somehow, and if we continue with it there is greater burden and loss, an increase in the number of these so called national schools merely adds to our burden and harms our cause.
('36', 178, 3, 16, 353538) In the event of tide we can easily multiply the number of national schools even if there is only one true national school.
('36', 178, 3, 17, 353661) But to produce anything good from a large number of schools national in name only
('36', 178, 4, 18, 353743) 1The letter is not translated here.
('36', 178, 4, 19, 353779) The correspondent, while agreeing that the national schools which fell short of the ideal should be closed down, had argued that they should not be closed down merely on account of the hostility of parents.
('36', 179, 0, 1, 353986) 180 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 179, 1, 2, 354028) is an utter impossibility.
('36', 179, 1, 3, 354055) Not only that, if the need for national schools does arise at some future date, the first thing we shall have to do then will be to try to put an end to these pseudo national schools.
('36', 179, 2, 4, 354239) Therefore where either the parents or the teachers are opposed to the national ideal, the national school should certainly be closed down.
('36', 179, 2, 5, 354378) Where the parents are fired by national ideals and prove their feelings by giving adequate donations for the support of national schools, and, where the teachers being themselves believers in the national ideal are ceaselessly striving to enforce it, I can understand a relaxation of the discipline if the scholars are lukewarm about the ideal.
('36', 179, 2, 6, 354723) In such a case, it may be necessary to continue the school.
('36', 179, 2, 7, 354783) For we may hope some day to influence the scholars.
('36', 179, 2, 8, 354835) But at the time of writing these lines, I can think of no such school.
('36', 179, 3, 9, 354906) My own experience is that where the national ideal is found wanting, the fault lies at the door of the teacher.
('36', 179, 3, 10, 355018) The instance quoted is that of a school where the teachers are enthusiastic, the pupils indifferent and the parents hostile.
('36', 179, 3, 11, 355143) Where the parents object to their children learning hand spinning and wearing khadi and threaten to withdraw their children if untouchable children are admitted, I see nothing but waste of the people’s time and loss of self respect for a teacher to carry on his work.
('36', 179, 3, 12, 355411) If we conduct national schools in spite of the opposition of parents, we would be guilty of the same fault that we impute to the Christian missionaries.
('36', 179, 3, 13, 355564) We have no right to impart instruction to children against the wish of their parents and to create family dissensions.
('36', 179, 3, 14, 355683) Those pupils who are over 16 years of age and who understand their interest, who are capable of suffering hardships, do not stand in need of protection: They have become self reliant.
('36', 179, 3, 15, 355867) For such, wherever necessary, we should open schools and undoubtedly conduct the existing ones.
('36', 179, 3, 16, 355963) But do we have such pupils anywhere in India?
('36', 179, 3, 17, 356009) How many are they?
('36', 179, 3, 18, 356028) And where are the schools in which there are students who can be likened to godly, fearless, long suffering and yet wise and respectful Prahlad?
('36', 179, 3, 19, 356173) When myriads of such scholars are produced, India will overflow with new life and no one will want to know where swaraj is.
('36', 179, 4, 20, 356297) And in order to produce a harvest of such scholars, we need to conduct only true national schools even though they may have only a few scholars.

('36', 180, 1, 3, 356919) We have now understood what non co operation is.
('36', 180, 1, 4, 356968) We are in a position to appraise its value.
('36', 180, 1, 5, 357012) The people are not ignorant of its dangers.
('36', 180, 1, 6, 357056) And, therefore, the way of non co operating schools is clear.
('36', 180, 1, 7, 357118) Let us never deceive ourselves.
('36', 180, 1, 8, 357150) Let us take the ups and downs in our stride and let us continue our work remaining firm in all faith and all will be well in the end.

('36', 180, 5, 12, 357365) Principal Anandshankar writes as follows: 1
('36', 180, 6, 13, 357409) When I read the letter in question I certainly did not feel that it in any way accused Principal Dhruva or Acharya Gidwani 2 of being against national education.
('36', 180, 6, 14, 357571) To other readers who do not know them, however, it may suggest a meaning which it did not to me because I knew them well.
('36', 180, 6, 15, 357693) Anandshankarbhai’s letter was thus really called for.
('36', 180, 6, 16, 357747) His happy and close association with the Vidyapith and the fact of his having accepted the chairmanship of the Vidyapith Enquiry Committee are enough evidence of his sympathy for the ideals of national education.
('36', 180, 6, 17, 357960) As for Acharya Gidwani, he was himself Principal of the national college.
('36', 180, 6, 18, 358034) The love and affection for him which the students displayed at the time of his leaving 3 the Vidyapith and the speedy collection by them of Rs. 1,500 for a scholarship for encouraging Antyaja uplift work, which was to be named after him in order to keep alive the memory of his association with the Vidyapith are irrefutable evidence of his faith in national education.

('36', 181, 3, 4, 358795) MY DEAR CHILD, I have your letter.
('36', 181, 3, 5, 358830) At least at the top of it you have my own writing and, for the time being it should be enough.
('36', 181, 3, 6, 358925) I too detest the typewriter.
('36', 181, 3, 7, 358954) I have a horror of it, but I survive it as I survive many things which do not do lasting harm.
('36', 181, 3, 8, 359049) If someone dispossessed me of the typewriter, I should not shed a single tear, but, as it is there, I make use of it and, even believe that some time is being savedfor more useful work.
('36', 181, 3, 9, 359235) But, even in this belief, I may be totally wrong.
('36', 181, 3, 10, 359285) It is so difficult to rise superior to one’s surroundings always.
('36', 181, 3, 11, 359351) Evidently Anne Marie is doing great and good work.
('36', 181, 3, 12, 359402) Prejudices die hard!
('36', 181, 3, 13, 359423) But, wherever there is earnestness, there is no difficulty about breaking down the hardest prejudices.
('36', 181, 3, 14, 359526) It will be a nice thing when Menon has his own hospital.
('36', 181, 3, 15, 359583) Mirabehn wanted to go through 7 days’ fast as a spiritual experience.
('36', 181, 3, 16, 359653) She completed it this morning and broke it on fruit juice.
('36', 181, 3, 17, 359712) She took the fast extremely well though she has lost ten pounds in seven days.
('36', 181, 3, 18, 359791) But that of course is nothing I do not expect much from the Viceroy.
('36', 181, 3, 19, 359860) He may be well meaning, but mere good intentions count for little.
('36', 181, 3, 20, 359927) But as you have very properly guessed, I can only say, whether it takes long or short, salvation must come only through ourselves.

('36', 182, 7, 17, 361310) I am simply filled with wonder.

('36', 182, 7, 20, 361624) You must have got my reply to that letter.
('36', 182, 7, 21, 361667) Shastriji wrote to me about the reply you gave him.

('36', 184, 1, 2, 363598) chains and regard the conqueror as their benefactor.
('36', 184, 1, 3, 363651) The different forts of India are no doubt a continuous reminder of the British might.
('36', 184, 1, 4, 363737) But the silent conquest of the mind of educated India is a surer guarantee of British stability than the formidable forts, i.e., if the opinion expressed by the distinguished lawyers in Indian Daily Mail on the very modest proposal of Sir Hari Singh Gour for the establishment of a Supreme Court at Delhi is an index of that mind.
('36', 184, 1, 5, 364068) For, these eminent lawyers regard the proposal as premature, in that judgments of the Privy Council sitting six thousand miles away from India would command, in their opinion, greater respect and ensure greater impartiality.
('36', 184, 1, 6, 364293) This amazing opinion, I venture to say, has no foundation in fact.
('36', 184, 1, 7, 364360) But distance lends enchantment to the scene.
('36', 184, 1, 8, 364405) Members of the Privy Council are, after all, human beings.
('36', 184, 1, 9, 364464) They have been found to betray political bias.
('36', 184, 1, 10, 364511) Their decisions in cases involving questions of custom are often distortions of the reality, not because they are perverse, but because it is not possible for mortals to know everything.
('36', 184, 1, 11, 364698) A less trained lawyer having a direct knowledge of a local custom is better able to appraise evidence on it than those who, no matter what their attainments are, know nothing of local conditions.
('36', 184, 2, 12, 364894) The distinguished lawyers moreover state that expenses will not be less because the final court of appeal is brought down to Delhi.
('36', 184, 2, 13, 365026) It does not say much for the patriotism of these eminent gentlemen, if they mean that the fees should be on the same scale in poor India as in rich England.
('36', 184, 2, 14, 365183) A Scotch friend once told me that Englishmen were probably the most extravagant in the world in their tastes and requirements.
('36', 184, 2, 15, 365310) He told me that hospitals in Scotland were far less expensively fitted than in England, though they were in no way inferior in usefulness to those in England.
('36', 184, 2, 16, 365469) Or does a legal argument increase in weight with an increase in the fees charged?
('36', 184, 3, 17, 365551) The third argument pressed into service in order to oppose the proposed change is that Indian judges will not command the same weight as the wigged ones in White Hall.
('36', 184, 3, 18, 365719) If this was not an argument advanced by distinguished lawyers, it would be laughed out.
('36', 184, 3, 19, 365807) Is respect for judgments commended by their impartiality, or thelocation, or the birth, or the colour of the skin, of judges?
('36', 184, 3, 20, 365933) And if it is the seat or the birth or the pigment that determines the weight to be attached to judges’ decisions, is it not high time that the superstition was removed by removing the seat and appointing judges of Indian birth?
('36', 184, 3, 21, 366161) Or does the argument presuppose partiality on the part of
('36', 185, 0, 1, 366219) 186 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 185, 1, 2, 366261) judges of Indian birth?
('36', 185, 1, 3, 366285) One does sometimes hear of poor people under stress of ignorance desiring an English Collector in the place of an Indian.
('36', 185, 1, 4, 366407) But greater fearlessness and sanity are surely to be expected of experienced lawyers.
('36', 185, 1, 5, 366493) But while, in my humble opinion, none of the three arguments advanced against the proposal has any force, the deciding reason for having our Supreme Court in India is that our self respect demands it.
('36', 185, 1, 6, 366694) Just as we cannot breathe with other’s lungs, be they ever so much more powerful, so may we not borrow or buy justice from England.
('36', 185, 1, 7, 366826) We must take pride in being satisfied with the work our own judges may give us.
('36', 185, 1, 8, 366906) Trials by jury often result, all over the world, in defeating justice.
('36', 185, 1, 9, 366977) But people everywhere gladly submit to the drawback for the sake of the more important result of the cultivation of an independent spirit among people and the justifiable sentiment of being judged by one’s own peers.
('36', 185, 1, 10, 367194) But sentiment is at a discount in legal circles.
('36', 185, 1, 11, 367243) And yet it is sentiment that rules the world.
('36', 185, 1, 12, 367289) Economics and every other consideration is often flung to the winds when sentiment predo minates.
('36', 185, 1, 13, 367387) Sentiment can be and must be regulated.
('36', 185, 1, 14, 367427) It cannot be, ought never to be, eradicated.
('36', 185, 1, 15, 367472) If it is not wrong to cherish patriotic feeling, it is surely not wrong to remove the final court of appeal to Delhi.
('36', 185, 1, 16, 367590) Just as good government is no substitute for self government, good justice, if foreign, is no substitute for homemade justice.

('36', 186, 2, 3, 368570) The chapter on perpetual continence is followed by chapters on the duty and indissolubility of marriage.
('36', 186, 2, 4, 368675) Whilst the author contends that perpetual continence is the highest state, it is not possible for the multitude for whom marriage must be regarded as a duty.
('36', 186, 2, 5, 368833) He shows if the function and limitations of marriage are rightly understood, there never can be any advocacy of contraceptives.
('36', 186, 2, 6, 368961) It is the wrong moral training that has brought about the prevalent moral indiscipline.
('36', 186, 2, 7, 369049) Having dealt with the opinion of ‘advanced’ writers ridiculing marriage the author says:
('36', 186, 3, 8, 369138) Happily for future generations, this opinion of pseudo moralists and of writers who are often utterly lacking in moral sense, and equally so sometimes in the real literary spirit, is very far from being that of the true psychologists and sociologists of our time; and in nothing is the rupture more complete between the noisy world of the press, the novel, and the stage, and that other world where thought is cultivated, and the mysterious elements of our psychological and social life are studied in detail.
('36', 186, 3, 9, 369648) M. Bureau rejects the argument of free love.
('36', 186, 3, 10, 369693) He holds that” marriage is the union of man and woman, the association for life, the communication of divine and human rights of law”.
('36', 186, 3, 11, 369828) Marriage is not a ‘‘mere civil contract” but a sacrament, a ‘‘moral obligation”.
('36', 186, 3, 12, 369909) It has succeeded in” making the gorilla stand erect”.
('36', 186, 4, 13, 369963) It is a great mistake to imagine that everything is permissible to those lawfully married and even supposing that husband and wife ordinarily respect the moral law as to transmission of life, it is untrue that it is lawful to add
('36', 186, 5, 14, 370193) other modes of sexual intercourse which please them.
('36', 186, 5, 15, 370246) This prohibition is as much in their interest as in that of society of which their marriage ought to be the maintenance and development.
('36', 186, 5, 16, 370383) The author holds that:
('36', 186, 6, 17, 370406) The ever renewed opportunities of deviation from strict discipline which marriage affords to the sexual instinct are a constant menace to true love.
('36', 186, 6, 18, 370555) This peril can only be exorcised by watchfulness to keep the satisfaction of the sexual appetite within the limits defined by the very ends of marriage.” It is always dangerous,” says St. Francis of Sales, ‘‘to take to violent medicines since if one takes more than should be taken, or if they are not well made up, much harm is done; marriage has been blessed and ordained partly as a remedy for concupiscence, and it is undoubtedly a very good remedy, but all the same a violent one, and consequently very dangerous if not discreetly used.

('36', 187, 1, 2, 371139) The author then combats the theory of individual liberty to contract or break the marriage bond at will or to live frankly a life of indulgence without its consequent obligation.
('36', 187, 1, 3, 371318) He insists on mono gamy and says:
('36', 187, 2, 4, 371352) It is untrue that the individual is at liberty to contract marriage or to remain in selfish celibacy, as he pleases; still less are duly married people free to agree together to the rupture of their union.
('36', 187, 2, 5, 371558) Their freedom is shown when they choose each other, and each is bound to choose only with full knowledge, after careful thought, the one with whom he believes he can assume the responsibilities of the new life he is entering.
('36', 187, 2, 6, 371784) But as soon as the marriage has been accomplished and consummated, the act performed involves, far away and in all directions, incalculable consequences which extend infinitely beyond the two persons’ who have brought them about.
('36', 187, 2, 7, 372014) These consequences may be unperceived, in a time of anarchic individualism such as ours, by the spouses themselves, but their importance is certified by the grave sufferings which come upon the whole body social, as soon as the stability of the home is shaken, as soon as the variable caprice of the sensual appetite takes the place of the beneficent discipline of the positive monogamic union.
('36', 187, 2, 8, 372409) To one who is conscious of these indefinitely extended repercussions and these subtle connections, it matters little to know that, since all human institutions are subject to the universal law of evolution, that of marriage must certainly, like all the rest, undergo in its turn necessary transformations, since there can be no doubt that progress in this direction can only take the form of eventually drawing more closely the marriage bond.
('36', 187, 2, 9, 372852) The attacks now made on the rule of the indissolubility of marriage” when divorce is asked for by mutual consent” will only bring into more prominent relief the social value of a rule against which protest is made, and as the years roll by this rule, which for some centuries, when its social value could not yet be appreciated, was simply a prescription of religious discipline, will appear more and more as a principle as beneficial to the individual as it is salutary for society at large.
('36', 187, 3, 10, 373345) The rule of indissolubility is not an arbitrary adornment; on the contrary, it is bound up with the most delicate mechanism of the individualand collective social life; and since people talk about evolution, they should ask on what condition this indefinite progress of the race which all agree to desire, is possible.
('36', 187, 3, 11, 373664) The deepening of the sense of responsibility, the training of the individual towards autonomous discipline willingly consented to, the growth of patience and charity, the control of selfishness, the maintenance of the emotional life against the elements that make for dissolution and the impulse of passing caprice—all these are dements in man’s interior life which we are entitled to consider the absolute and permanent conditions of all higher social

('36', 188, 1, 2, 374162) culture, and on this account exempt from all such disorder as might result from a serious change in economic conditions.
('36', 188, 1, 3, 374283) To tell the truth, economic progress is itself closely bound up with general social progress, for economic security and success depend in the long run on the sincerity and loyalty of our social co operation.
('36', 188, 1, 4, 374491) Every economic modification which ignores these fundamental conditions is self condemned.
('36', 188, 1, 5, 374581) If we wish, therefore, to take up the study, at once both moral and social, of the absolute value of the various methods of sexual relations, the following question is decisive: What method is the best adapted to the deepening and strengthening of our whole social life?
('36', 188, 1, 6, 374852) Which is the most capable, at the different periods of life, of developing to the utmost the sense of responsibility, self abnegation and sacrifice, of most effectively restraining undisciplined selfishness and capricious frivolity?
('36', 188, 1, 7, 375085) When the matter is viewed from this standpoint, there is not the slightest doubt that monogamy, because of its social and educative value, must form part of the permanent heritage of all more advanced civilizations; and true progress will draw more closely, rather than relax, the marriage bond.
('36', 188, 1, 8, 375381) The family is the center of all human preparation for the social life, that is to say, all preparation for responsibility, sympathy, self control, mutual tolerance, and reciprocal training.
('36', 188, 1, 9, 375571) And the family only fills this central place because it lasts all through life and is indissoluble, and because, thanks to this permanence, the common family life becomes deeper, more stable, more adapted to men’s mutual intercourse than any other.
('36', 188, 1, 10, 375820) It may be said that monogamic marriage is the conscience of all human social life.
('36', 188, 2, 11, 375903) He quotes Auguste Comte:” Our hearts are so changeable that society must intervene to hold in check the vacillation and caprices which would otherwise drag down human existence to be nothing but a series of nonworthy and pointless experiences.
('36', 188, 2, 12, 376147) Satisfaction of lust is never the end of marriage.”
('36', 188, 3, 13, 376199) “A fiction,” writes Dr. Toulouse,” which often hinders the happiness of married people, is that the instinct of love is a tyrant and must be satisfied at any price .
('36', 188, 3, 14, 376365) Now the very characteristic quality of man, and the apparent end of his evolution” is an ever growing independence of his appetites.
('36', 188, 3, 15, 376498) The child learns to master his coarser needs, and the adult to overcome his passions.
('36', 188, 3, 16, 376584) This scheme of all good upbringing is not chimerical, nor something outside practical life for the end of our nature is precisely to be subject, in great degree, to the personal tendencies which constitute our will.
('36', 188, 3, 17, 376800) What one shelters behind as ‘temperament’ is usually nothing but weakness.

('36', 189, 1, 2, 377017) 211. TRIUMPH OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE
('36', 189, 2, 3, 377052) Pundit Malaviyaji’s triumph is a national victory.
('36', 189, 2, 4, 377103) Disrupted and demoralized though we are at the present moment, Punditji has shown that there is still courage left in us to defy the might of the mightiest empire.
('36', 189, 2, 5, 377267) To have issued notice light heartedly against one of the oldest and most respected and best known of India’s public servants was an insolent exhibition of power.
('36', 189, 2, 6, 377429) Let us assume for the moment that the Government had sufficient grounds for fearing Pundit Malaviyaji’s presence in Calcutta at a time when they were trying to bring about peace.
('36', 189, 2, 7, 377608) It was still wrong to have dealt summarily with a man of Punditji’s position in the Indian world.
('36', 189, 2, 8, 377706) It would not have derogated from the Acting Governor’s dignity if he had written a private note to punditiji or if he had invited him for a conference and placed before him the evidence in his possession and told him to absent himself in the interests of peace which Panditji claimed to desire as much as the Governor himself.
('36', 189, 2, 9, 378033) In every one of his public speeches Punditji has put emphasis upon the desirability of peace.
('36', 189, 2, 10, 378127) But the Government is too disdainful of public opinion even to think of any such courteous action.
('36', 189, 2, 11, 378226) It expected Punditji and Dr. Moonje to take the order with due and humble submission.
('36', 189, 2, 12, 378312) The Government evidently expected that non co operation was dead, that civil disobedience died even before non co operation and was decently buried at Bardoli, and that the Congress resolutions on civil disobedience were all idle threats.
('36', 189, 2, 13, 378551) The Bengal Government has now discovered its mistake.
('36', 189, 2, 14, 378605) Punditji’s letter is a lesson in self restraint combined with firmness.
('36', 189, 2, 15, 378677) His following up the letter with action, his refusal to see the Magistrate and his triumphant entry into Calcutta, his advice to the people not to lose their heads, not to demonstrate, and his quiet continuance of his programme as if nothing had happened, furnish an object lesson in perfect civil disobedience.
('36', 189, 2, 16, 378989) It is to be hoped that the Government will understand that civil disobedience has come to stay and when occasion demands it, there will be more than one person in the country to adopt it.
('36', 189, 3, 17, 379177) Both Hindus and Mussalmans will commit a serious blunder if we consider that the serving of notice on Punditji and Dr. Moonje was an anti Hindu and pro Mahommedan act.
('36', 189, 3, 18, 379345) With the Government all is grist that comes to its mill.
('36', 189, 3, 19, 379402) If today it is a distinguished Hindu who has been served with a notice, it will be tomorrow an equally distinguished Mussalman to receive the same attention if the Government desires it for its own end.
('36', 189, 3, 20, 379605) Nobody is deceived by the declaration that the
('36', 190, 0, 1, 379652) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 191
('36', 190, 1, 2, 379697) Government sincerely wants peace between the communities.
('36', 190, 1, 3, 379755) I venture to suggest that a real desire for peace between Hindus and Mussalmans is wholly inconsistent with the desire to retain British rule in India by force of arms.
('36', 190, 1, 4, 379924) When British officials begin the work of peace between these two branches of the Indian family, they will have begun to live in India on sufferance.
('36', 190, 1, 5, 380073) After all, the discovery that India is governed by the ‘divide and rule’ policy was made, in the first instance, not by an Indian but, if I am not mistaken, by an Englishman.
('36', 190, 1, 6, 380248) It was either the late Allen Octavius Hume or George Yule who taught us to believe that the Empire was based upon a policy of divide and rule.
('36', 190, 1, 7, 380391) Nor need we be surprised at or resent it.
('36', 190, 1, 8, 380433) Imperial Rome did no otherwise.
('36', 190, 1, 9, 380465) British did no otherwise with the Boers.
('36', 190, 1, 10, 380506) By a system of favouritism it sought to divide the Boer ranks.
('36', 190, 1, 11, 380569) The Government of India is based upon distrust.
('36', 190, 1, 12, 380617) Distrust involves favouritism and favouritism must breed division.
('36', 190, 1, 13, 380684) There are frank Englishmen enough who have owned this fact.
('36', 190, 1, 14, 380744) No serious student of Indian history can help rejecting the recent declarations about peace on the part of the Viceroy or the Governors.
('36', 190, 1, 15, 380881) I am prepared to believe that His Excellency the Viceroy is sincere in his declaration.
('36', 190, 1, 16, 380969) It is not necessary for one to impute dishonesty to the high officials, if one is to ascribe the policy of ‘divide and rule’ to the Government.
('36', 190, 1, 17, 381113) The division policy need not be always conscious and deliberate.
('36', 190, 1, 18, 381178) Mussalmans against Hindus, non Brahmins against Brahmins, Sikhs against both, Gurkhas against all the three, this game of permutation and combination has gone on ever since the advent of British rule, and will continue so long as the Government considers its interests so be antagonistic to those of the people or its existence to be against the desire of the people.
('36', 190, 1, 19, 381546) Hence it is that swaraj is a vital necessity for national growth.
('36', 190, 1, 20, 381612) Hence it is that Mrs. Besant has stated not without much force that Hindu Muslim unity is almost an impossibility without swaraj.
('36', 190, 1, 21, 381742) And unfortunately we are having it demonstrated to us daily that swaraj is an equal impossibility without Hindu Muslim unity.
('36', 190, 1, 22, 381868) I am however optimistic enough to believe that the unity will come in spite of ourselves because, I implicitly believe in Lokamanya’s motto” Swaraj is my birthright and I shall have it.” Where man’s effort may fail, God’s will succeed, and His Government is not based upon ‘divide and rule’ policy.

('36', 191, 2, 3, 382267) Professor Bijapurkar whose death was announced last week was one of the pioneers of national education.
('36', 191, 2, 4, 382371) He may be said to have given his whole life to national education.
('36', 191, 2, 5, 382438) He suffered much for it.
('36', 191, 2, 6, 382463) He was the soul of the institution at Talegaon.
('36', 191, 2, 7, 382511) He laboured to give the students text books in Marathi.
('36', 191, 2, 8, 382567) He abhorred cant, humbug and untruth.
('36', 191, 2, 9, 382605) He was, like all Maharashtra workers, an embodiment of simplicity.
('36', 191, 2, 10, 382672) He was adored by his pupils whom he loved as a father loves his children.
('36', 191, 2, 11, 382746) I tender my condolences to the members of the deceased’s family and to those devoted followers whom he has left behind him.

('36', 191, 5, 14, 382923) The following is an extract from a detailed letter 1 from a correspondent who gives his full name and address:
('36', 191, 6, 15, 383034) You may know what is happening to Congress workers in Madras.
('36', 191, 6, 16, 383096) During the last two days, the Justice Party men have excelled themselves in their abominations.
('36', 191, 6, 17, 383192) accompanied by Mr. .
('36', 191, 6, 18, 383213) was conversing votes for Mr. .
('36', 191, 6, 19, 383244) the Congress candidate.
('36', 191, 6, 20, 383268) A group of Justice men who kept following Mr. .
('36', 191, 6, 21, 383316) and others when they came near the Justice candidate’s house suddenly surrounded the Congress workers and spat upon .
('36', 191, 6, 22, 383434) .’s faces.
('36', 191, 6, 23, 383445) The object of addressing you these few words is to ask you to enunciate your theory of non violence with reference to what a Congressman should do under circumstances of such grave indignity and insult.
('36', 191, 6, 24, 383648) The provocation is increasing every day, and it may not be possible for Congress workers to restrain the youthful followers from taking the law into their own hands.
('36', 191, 6, 25, 383814) Therefore may I ask you to state if private defence is compatible with non violence and with what qualifications it should be exercised?
('36', 191, 6, 26, 383951) One reason why I request you to publish your opinion as early as you possibly can is that we are told that the Justice Party is experimenting with hooligan tactics to see if it succeeds, so that they might systematize it into a regular art of political warfare against the Congress in the coming Council and Assembly elections in November.
('36', 191, 6, 27, 384291) I have purposely erased names of men and places; for, their discovery is not required for my purpose.
('36', 191, 6, 28, 384393) Time for expedient
('36', 191, 7, 29, 384412) 1 Only excerpts from the passage quoted are reproduced here.

('36', 192, 1, 2, 384518) non violence passed away long ago.
('36', 192, 1, 3, 384553) Those who cannot be non violent at heart are under no obligation to be non violent under the circumstances mentioned by the correspondent.
('36', 192, 1, 4, 384692) Though non violence is the creed of the Congress, nobody now refers to the creed for being or remaining non violent.
('36', 192, 1, 5, 384809) Every Congressman who is non violent is so because he cannot be otherwise.
('36', 192, 1, 6, 384884) My advice therefore emphatically is that no one need refer to me or any other Congressmen for advice in the matter of non violence.
('36', 192, 1, 7, 385016) Everyone must act on his own responsibility, and interpret the Congress creed to the best of his ability and belief.
('36', 192, 1, 8, 385133) I have often noticed that weak people have taken shelter under the Congress creed or under my advice, when they have simply by reason of their cowardice been unable to defend their own honour or that of those who were entrusted to their care.
('36', 192, 1, 9, 385376) I recall the incident that happened near Bettiah when non co operation was at its height.
('36', 192, 1, 10, 385466) Some villagers were looted.
('36', 192, 1, 11, 385494) They had fled leaving their wives, children and belongings to the mercy of the looters.
('36', 192, 1, 12, 385582) When I rebuked them for their cowardice in thus neglecting their charge, they shamelessly pleaded non violence.
('36', 192, 1, 13, 385694) I publicly denounced their conduct and said that my non violence fully accommodated violence offered by those who did not feel non violence and who had in their keeping the honour of their womenfolk and little children.
('36', 192, 1, 14, 385914) Non violence is not a cover for cowardice, but it is the supreme virtue of the brave.
('36', 192, 1, 15, 386000) Exercise of non violence requires far greater bravery than that of swordsmanship.
('36', 192, 1, 16, 386082) Cowardice is wholly inconsistent with non violence.
('36', 192, 1, 17, 386134) Translation from swordsmanship to non violence is possible and at times even an easy stage.
('36', 192, 1, 18, 386226) Non violence, therefore, presupposes ability to strike.
('36', 192, 1, 19, 386282) It is a conscious deliberate restraint put upon one’s desire for vengeance.
('36', 192, 1, 20, 386358) But vengeance is any day superior to passive, effeminate and helpless submission.
('36', 192, 1, 21, 386440) Forgiveness is higher still.
('36', 192, 1, 22, 386469) Vengeance too is weakness.
('36', 192, 1, 23, 386496) The desire for vengeance comes out of fear of harm, imaginary or real.
('36', 192, 1, 24, 386567) A dog barks and bites when he fears.
('36', 192, 1, 25, 386604) A man who fears no one on earth would consider it too troublesome even to summon up anger against one who is vainly trying to injure him.
('36', 192, 1, 26, 386742) The sun does not wreak vengeance upon little children who throw dust at him.
('36', 192, 1, 27, 386819) They only harm themselves in the act.
('36', 192, 1, 28, 386857) I do not know whether the statements made by the correspon dent about the misdeeds of the Justice Party men are true.
('36', 192, 1, 29, 386975) Perhaps, there is another side to the story.
('36', 192, 1, 30, 387020) But, assuming the truth of the statements, I can only congratulate those who were spat upon, or assaulted or had night soil thrown upon them.
('36', 192, 1, 31, 387162) No injury has
('36', 193, 0, 1, 387176) 194 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 193, 1, 2, 387218) happened to them if they had the courage to suffer the insult without even mental retaliation.
('36', 193, 1, 3, 387313) But, it was wholly wrong on their part to suffer it, if they felt irritated, but refrained out of expedience from retaliating.
('36', 193, 1, 4, 387440) A sense of self respect disdains all expedience.
('36', 193, 1, 5, 387489) But I wonder what kind of punishment could be meted out by distinguished Congressmen who, as the correspondent states, were too numerous for the few hooligans of the Justice Party.
('36', 193, 1, 6, 387670) Were they to return night soil with night soil, spitting with spitting, and abuse with abuse?
('36', 193, 1, 7, 387764) Or, would the self respect of this numerous party be better consulted by ignoring the few hooligans?
('36', 193, 1, 8, 387865) When non co operation was the fashion, I know what was done to hooligans who tried to disturb meetings.
('36', 193, 1, 9, 387969) They were held down by volunteers who caused them no hurt, but, if they continued to howl, their howling was ignored.
('36', 193, 1, 10, 388087) I know that even in those days, in several cases the law of non violence was broken and any man who dared to disturb the meetings or put in a word of opposition was howled down by the violent majority or, some times, even roughly handled to the discredit of the majority and the movement which they so thoughtlessly betrayed and misrepresented.
('36', 193, 1, 11, 388432) I suggest also to this Congressman and to those whom he may represent that, if the object is to win over the Justice Party or any other party to the Congress, then, they should be treated gently even though they may act harshly.
('36', 193, 1, 12, 388661) If it is to suppress all opponents, then, double retaliation or Dyerism is the chosen remedy.
('36', 193, 1, 13, 388755) Whether that can bring us any nearer swaraj is, of course, another question.
('36', 193, 1, 14, 388832) But all my advice is useless where conviction is wanting.
('36', 193, 1, 15, 388890) Let every Congressman, therefore, weigh all the pros and cons, then make his definite choice and act accordingly, irrespective of consequences.
('36', 193, 1, 16, 389034) He will then have acted truly even though it may be mistakenly.
('36', 193, 1, 17, 389098) A thousand mistakes unconsciously made are better than the most scrupulously correct conduct without conviction behind to back it.
('36', 193, 1, 18, 389229) It is like a whited sepulchre.
('36', 193, 1, 19, 389260) Above all, we must be true to ourselves if we will be true to the country and lead it to its chosen goal.
('36', 193, 1, 20, 389366) Let there be no cant about non violence.
('36', 193, 1, 21, 389407) It is not like a garment to be put onand off at will.
('36', 193, 1, 22, 389461) Its seat is in the heart and it must be an inseparable part of our very being.

('36', 194, 3, 4, 389674) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter 1 of the 6th August.
('36', 194, 3, 5, 389736) I have now enquired.
('36', 194, 3, 6, 389757) It is not possible to certify that the students of the National College cannot afford to buy.
('36', 194, 3, 7, 389851) But I sent a messenger yesterday to find out how many students would care to buy copies at reduced charges.
('36', 194, 3, 8, 389959) I got 40 applications.
('36', 194, 3, 9, 389982) If you will kindly tell me what it would cost the students to get the copies, I would be able to tell you whether they will have them at the price or not.
('36', 194, 3, 10, 390137) I am inclined to think that it would be better for them to possess the whole of the Bible and not merely the New Testament.
('36', 194, 3, 11, 390261) I think you have in stock a cheap edition of the whole Bible.
('36', 194, 3, 12, 390323) Of course, it is the English text that they would want.

('36', 194, 10, 22, 390796) 1 R. A. Adams had referred in this to having received a request from a student of the National College for a free copy of the New Testament, and enclosed his reply (S.N. 10977) to him.
('36', 194, 10, 23, 390981) He had added that if a list of other students desiring to have complimentary copies were sent to him, he would be glad to send them too (S.N. 10976).

('36', 195, 5, 16, 392037) DEAR SISTERS, I am thankful for your letter 1. Beyond knowing the general trend of the tragic events in Pabna and elsewhere; I know nothing.
('36', 195, 5, 17, 392178) 2 I do not read newspaper reports because I distrust them.
('36', 195, 5, 18, 392237) I would, therefore, feel grateful to you if you could send me authentic information that may be in your possession.
('36', 195, 5, 19, 392353) The question you want me to answer in the pages of Young India is rather delicate.
('36', 195, 5, 20, 392436) 3 I am not sure that I shall serve the cause you and I have at heart by a public discussion of a delicate question.
('36', 195, 5, 21, 392552) The information I have gathered from trustworthy friends goes to show
('36', 195, 6, 22, 392622) 1 This was dated August 4, 1926. It furnished the correspondents’ address as suggested by Gandhiji; vide” Notes”, 29 7 1926, sub title,” To ‘Some Bengali Ladies’” .
('36', 195, 6, 23, 392787) 2 The correspondents had referred to outrages against Hindu women by Muslim rowdies in Bengal villages and recalled a remark, which they said, was once made by Ramananda Chatterji, editor of Modern Review, in his Bengal journal, Prabasi, that he wondered why Gandhiji said nothing about the persecuted women of Bengal, though he had stayed and travelled through Bengal for a long time (S. N. 12378) 3 The question was” What should women do when such events were going to take place and whether they should not take to physical exercise from the very childhood and be taught to defend themselves against such villains.”
('36', 196, 0, 1, 393406) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 197
('36', 196, 1, 2, 393451) that wherever violence has occurred, it was due to the cowardice of men rather than the inability of the women to protect their honour by physical resistance.
('36', 196, 1, 3, 393610) I question the advisability of the formation of an association such as you suggest, not because it is sinful for a woman to use the dagger or the pistol when she knows not any other method, but because in the vast majority of cases such self defence proves worse than useless and because it will take generations before our women take to the dagger or the pistol in any appreciable number.
('36', 196, 1, 4, 394000) Perhaps, the quicker method is for women to shame men into performing their primary duty of protecting their womenfolk at all costs.
('36', 196, 1, 5, 394133) But, before any step can be taken, you must have incontrovertible facts before you.
('36', 196, 1, 6, 394217) Is the disease general?
('36', 196, 1, 7, 394241) How many cases of real violence have happened, say, during the past six months?
('36', 196, 1, 8, 394321) Was it impossible in every case for men to protect the victims?
('36', 196, 1, 9, 394385) What is the precise method adopted by the miscreants to secure their victims?
('36', 196, 1, 10, 394463) I hope you would not take a single step without knowing the full facts, and without reasonable hope of securing acceptance of the methods that you may suggest for meeting the evil.

('36', 198, 1, 3, 396645) I don’t think it is.
('36', 198, 1, 4, 396666) Does it happen anywhere that parents and teachers want their children and pupils always to wear khadi but the latter refuse to do so?
('36', 198, 1, 5, 396800) Do not the pupils in your school wear khadi?
('36', 198, 1, 6, 396845) If I have understood you correctly, a large majority of them do.
('36', 198, 1, 7, 396910) How, then, can the paragraph in question apply to you?
('36', 198, 1, 8, 396965) If the pupils do not in fact wear khadi, then it may be said that your school does not belong to the type I have supposed.
('36', 198, 1, 9, 397088) In that case, too, it should be continued, according to that paragraph.

('36', 198, 6, 19, 397558) I acted upon your telegram as soon as I could.
('36', 198, 6, 20, 397605) You must have got the spinning wheel by now.
('36', 198, 6, 21, 397650) I forgot to give instructions about slivers, and they may not have been packed.
('36', 198, 6, 22, 397730) There can be no comparison between Mrs. Besant and the Maharani 1. I have done no injustice to the latter.
('36', 198, 6, 23, 397837) Mrs. Besant is a public figure and, if she bought a spinning wheel, she would do so because she understood its value.
('36', 198, 6, 24, 397955) On the other hand the Maharani, even if she took up spinning, would do so as an amusement.
('36', 198, 6, 25, 398046) Impartiality does not rule out discrimination.
('36', 198, 6, 26, 398093) I have explained only one reason.
('36', 198, 6, 27, 398127) You yourself have given a second reason in your letter, in your description of the Maharaja.
('36', 198, 6, 28, 398220) I know much about him.
('36', 198, 6, 29, 398243) His life is none too pure, and he has an extremely unsteady mind.
('36', 198, 6, 30, 398309) He is not at all dependable.
('36', 198, 6, 31, 398338) He hopes to get something done through me, and I am not in a position to satisfy his hope.

('36', 199, 1, 6, 398875) You may go to Simla any time you wish to, but, whether you are in Simla or Mussoorie, you should always carry on public work.
('36', 199, 1, 7, 399001) Only in this way will you succeed in promoting the sale of khadi.
('36', 199, 1, 8, 399067) And see that you attend to everything yourself.
('36', 199, 1, 9, 399115) I have suggested to Chhaganlal 1 that he should reserve for you the khadi which in your letter you have asked him to send to you.

('36', 201, 7, 13, 402466) Whilst I can entirely approve of your method of work, I can equally well endorse the methods adopted by the Khadi Pratishthan and the Abhoy Ashram.
('36', 201, 7, 14, 402614) Each has its place.
('36', 201, 7, 15, 402634) Khadi Pratishthan work is surely not exploitation.
('36', 201, 7, 16, 402685) Exploitation of whom by whom?
('36', 201, 7, 17, 402715) Not of the women who are able, because of the Pratishthan having created a market, to sell their yarn in ever increasing quantity and not by Khadi Pratishthan, for, it makes no profits for shareholders or directors.
('36', 201, 7, 18, 402931) On the contrary, several of its members are giving of their very best to the Khadi Pratishthan and, this work as surely makes for swaraj as yours, if only because vast production and sale of khadi makes boycott of foreign cloth possible within a measurable distance of time.
('36', 201, 7, 19, 403206) It is wrong to suggest that the Khadi Pratishthan workers do not come in touch with the spinners.
('36', 201, 7, 20, 403304) It would be right if you said that they do not come in as close touch as you do.
('36', 201, 7, 21, 403385) But, that merely means that you are working for depth, Khadi

('36', 202, 1, 3, 403676) Both the activities are necessary and complimentary one of the other.
('36', 202, 1, 4, 403746) Abhoy Ashram stands midway between the two and thus all these three efforts if they could be joined, co ordinated and regularized, the work will be much better.
('36', 202, 1, 5, 403907) All therefore I advise you to do is not to abandon your admirable programme, but on the strength of that programme to secure the assistance and approval of the Bengal Agent of the All India Spinners’ Association.

('36', 205, 7, 11, 408347) DEAR SATIS BABU, I have your letter.
('36', 205, 7, 12, 408384) 1 I do not think Mr. Mavalankar says it is better not to have this security, if the shares can be transferred.
('36', 205, 7, 13, 408495) In any event nothing more is necessary to be done beyond transferring the shares if that is possible.
('36', 205, 7, 14, 408597) If for any reason you think that it is not possible, your other suggestion may be adopted.
('36', 205, 8, 15, 408688) Do what you like with Sodepur and Hemaprabhadevi’s money.
('36', 205, 8, 16, 408746) I have only the inflexible condition, that the giving on the part of Hemaprabhadevi must be an irresistible thing.
('36', 205, 9, 17, 408861) There is something wrong as long as you feel worried.
('36', 205, 9, 18, 408915) She cannot be cheerful and happy if you are not.
('36', 205, 9, 19, 408964) I would, therefore, plead with you to go slowly.
('36', 205, 9, 20, 409013) Do not force matters.
('36', 205, 9, 21, 409035) Let there be complete assimilation before taking in a fresh dose.
('36', 205, 10, 22, 409101) Yes, indeed, I have read Tolstoy’s” How Much Land a Man Needs” many times over.
('36', 205, 10, 23, 409181) Years ago I translated it in Indian Opinion and it was published in pamphlet form.
('36', 205, 10, 24, 409264) If Tolstoy had known much of cremation, he would even have allowed much less space and, if the body were to receive scientific treatment of reduction, it would be resolved into the five elements and then no space at all would be required.
('36', 205, 10, 25, 409503) And that is precisely what our mental state should be.
('36', 205, 10, 26, 409558) In practice we will always fall short of the theory.
('36', 205, 10, 27, 409611) But any little

('36', 206, 1, 2, 409735) possession we may keep would then be irksome.
('36', 206, 1, 3, 409781) We would recognize it as our limitation and not as our right.
('36', 206, 1, 4, 409843) And, therefore, if suddenly we are deprived of it, we should feel as if so much burden was taken off our shoulders and so finally we should feel even when the body of ours is taken away.
('36', 206, 1, 5, 410030) Beyond all your sacrifices, therefore, I want perfect equanimity and cheerfulness.
('36', 206, 1, 6, 410113) The greater the detachment with which you organize khadi work the more prosperous it will be.

('36', 207, 6, 8, 411726) MATHURADAS, I have your letter.
('36', 207, 6, 9, 411758) I gather from the papers that many Hindus suffered losses in the serious riots between Hindus and Muslims which occurred in Pabna.
('36', 207, 6, 10, 411889) Mrs. Naidu 1 wants to have the money which is lying with you and to use it to help these people.
('36', 207, 6, 11, 411986) My own view is that the fund is for the purpose of providing relief to victims of floods and other calamities.
('36', 207, 6, 12, 412097) Pabna’s case being of a different character, a separate collection should be made for it.
('36', 207, 6, 13, 412187) However, the fund can certainly be used for any other purpose after consulting the donors.
('36', 207, 7, 14, 412278) I hope the heavy rains are not affecting your health.

('36', 208, 1, 3, 412981) In any case, its use cannot be opposed on religious grounds.
('36', 208, 1, 4, 413042) Personally, I do not regard contact with a woman in menses as forbidden, nor regard it as objectionable to eat food cooked by her, but the attitude of those who do regard these things as wrong can be justified on hygienic grounds.
('36', 208, 1, 5, 413273) It is difficult to say how far the religious point of view can help us in this matter, for the various religions hold different beliefs about it.

('36', 209, 5, 7, 414366) It is now time to conclude this series of articles.
('36', 209, 5, 8, 414418) It is not necessary to pursue M. Bureau in his examination of the doctrine of Malthus who startled his generation by his theory of over population and his advocacy of birth control if the human species was not to be extinct.
('36', 209, 5, 9, 414643) Malthus, however, advocated continence, whereas Neo Malthusianism advocates not restraint but the use of chemical and mechanical means to avoid the consequences of animal indulgence.
('36', 209, 5, 10, 414826) M. Bureau heartily accepts the doctrine of birth control by moral means, i.e., self restraint, and, as we have seen, rejects and vigorously condemns the use of chemical or mechanical means.
('36', 209, 5, 11, 415016) The author then examines the condition of working classes and the proportion of birth among them and finally closes the book by examining the means of checking the practice of grossest immoralities under the name of individual freedom and even humanity.
('36', 209, 5, 12, 415270) He suggests organized attempt to guide and regulate the public opinion and advocates State interference, but finally relies upon quickening of the religious life.
('36', 209, 5, 13, 415433) Moral bankruptcy cannot be met or arrested by ordinary methods, most certainly not when immorality is claimed as a virtue and morality condemned as a weakness, superstition or even immorality.
('36', 209, 5, 14, 415626) For many advocates of contraceptives do indeed condemn continence as unnecessary and even harmful.
('36', 209, 5, 15, 415725) In this state of things religious aid is the only effective check upon licensed vice.
('36', 209, 5, 16, 415811) Religion here may not be taken in its narrow, parochial sense.
('36', 209, 5, 17, 415874) True religion is the greatest disturbing factor in life, whether individual or collective.
('36', 209, 5, 18, 415965) A religious awakening constitutes a revolution, a transformation, a regeneration.
('36', 209, 5, 19, 416047) And nothing but some such dynamic force can positively prevent the moral catastrophe towards which, in M. Bureau’s estimation, France seems to be moving.
('36', 209, 5, 20, 416201) But we must here leave the author and his book; French conditions are not Indian conditions.
('36', 209, 5, 21, 416294) Ours is a somewhat different

('36', 210, 1, 2, 416368) problem.
('36', 210, 1, 3, 416377) Contraceptives are not universal in India.
('36', 210, 1, 4, 416420) Their use has hardly touched the educated classes.
('36', 210, 1, 5, 416471) The use of contraceptives in India is, in my opinion, unwarranted by any single condition that can be named.
('36', 210, 1, 6, 416580) Do middle class parents suffer from too many children?
('36', 210, 1, 7, 416635) Individual instances will not suffice to make out a case for excessive birth rate among the middle classes.
('36', 210, 1, 8, 416743) The cases in India where I haveobserved the advocacy of these methods are those of widows and young wives.
('36', 210, 1, 9, 416850) Thus in the one case it is illegitimate birth that is to be avoided, not the secret intercourse.
('36', 210, 1, 10, 416947) In the other, it is again pregnancy that is to be feared, and not the rape, of a girl of tender age.
('36', 210, 1, 11, 417048) Then there remains the class of diseased weak effeminate young men who would indulge in excesses with their own wives or others’ wives and would avoid the consequences of acts which they know to be sinful.
('36', 210, 1, 12, 417254) The cases of men or women in full vigour of life desiring intercourse and yet wishing to avoid the burden of children are, I make bold to say, rare in this ocean of Indian humanity.
('36', 210, 1, 13, 417436) Let them not parade their cases to justify and advocate a practice that in India, if it became general, is bound to ruin the youth of the country.
('36', 210, 1, 14, 417583) A highly artificial education has robbed the nation’s youth of physical and mental vigour.
('36', 210, 1, 15, 417674) We are offspring in many cases of child marriages.
('36', 210, 1, 16, 417725) Our disregard of the laws of health and sanitation has undermined our bodies.
('36', 210, 1, 17, 417803) Our wrong and deficient dietary composed of corroding spices has produced a collapse of the digestive apparatus.
('36', 210, 1, 18, 417916) We need, not lessons in the use of contraceptives and helps to our being able to satisfy our animal appetite, but continuous lessons to restrain that appetite, in many cases even to the extent of absolute continence.
('36', 210, 1, 19, 418133) We need to be taught by precept and example that continence is perfectly possible and imperatively necessary if we are not to remain mentally and physically weak.
('36', 210, 1, 20, 418296) We need to be told from the housetop that if we will not be a nation of manikins, we must conserve and add to the limited vital energy we are daily dissipating.
('36', 210, 1, 21, 418457) Our young widows need to be told not to sin secretly but come out boldly and openly to demand marriage which is their right as much as that of young widowers.
('36', 210, 1, 22, 418616) We need to cultivate public opinion that shall make child marriages impossible.
('36', 210, 1, 23, 418696) The vacillation, and the disinclination to do hard and sustained work, the physical inability to perform strenuous labours, collapses of enterprises brilliantly begun, the want of origina lity, one notices so often, are due largely to excessive indulgence.
('36', 210, 1, 24, 418953) I hope young men do not deceive themselves into the belief that, when there is no procreation, the mere indulgence does not matter, does not
('36', 211, 0, 1, 419094) 212 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 211, 1, 2, 419136) weaken.
('36', 211, 1, 3, 419144) Indeed the sexual act, with the unnatural safeguard against procreation, is likely to be far more exhausting than such act performed with a full sense of the responsibility attached to it.
('36', 211, 2, 4, 419333) The mind is its own place, and in itself
('36', 211, 3, 5, 419374) Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.
('36', 211, 3, 6, 419419) If we begin to believe that indulgence in animal passion is necessary, harmless and sinless, we shall want to give reins to it and shall be powerless to resist it.
('36', 211, 3, 7, 419583) Whereas, if we educate ourselves to believe that such indulgence is harmful, sinful, unnecessary and can be controlled, we shall discover that self restraint is perfectly possible.
('36', 211, 3, 8, 419764) Let us beware of the strong wine of libertinism that the intoxicated West sends us under the guise of new truth and so called human freedom.
('36', 211, 3, 9, 419905) Let us, on the contrary, listen to the sober voice from the West, that through the rich experience of its wise men at times percolates to us, i.e., if we have outgrown the ancient wisdom of our forefathers.
('36', 211, 4, 10, 420112) Charlie Andrews has sent me an informing article on” Genera tion and Regeneration” written by William Loftus Hare and printed in The Open Court (March 1926).
('36', 211, 4, 11, 420270) It is a closely reasoned scientific essay.
('36', 211, 4, 12, 420313) He shows that all bodies perform two functions: ‘namely, internal reproduction for the building up of the body and external reproduction for the continuance of the species.’ These processes he names regeneration and generation, respectively.
('36', 211, 5, 13, 420555) The regenerative process—internal reproduction—is fundamental for the individual and, therefore, necessary and primary; ‘the generative process is due to a superfluity of cells and is therefore secondary ....
('36', 211, 5, 14, 420764) The law of life, then, at this level is to feed the germ cells, firstly, for regeneration, and, secondly, for generation.
('36', 211, 5, 15, 420886) In case of deficiency, regeneration must take the first place and generation be suspended.
('36', 211, 5, 16, 420977) Thus, we may learn the origin of the suspension of reproduction and follow it to its later phases of human continence and asceticism generally.
('36', 211, 5, 17, 421121) Inner re production can never be suspended except at the cost of death, the normal origin of which is thus also discerned.
('36', 211, 6, 18, 421244) After describing the biological process of regeneration the writer states:
('36', 211, 7, 19, 421319) Among civilized human beings sexual intercourse is practised vastly more than is necessary for the production of the next generation and is carried on at the expense of internal reproduction, bringing disease, death and more in its train.
('36', 212, 0, 1, 421558) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 213
('36', 212, 1, 2, 421603) No one who knows anything of Hindu philosophy can have difficulty in following this paragraph from Mr. Hare’s essay:
('36', 212, 2, 3, 421720) The process of regeneration is not and cannot be mechanistic in character, but like the primitive fission, is vitalistic.
('36', 212, 2, 4, 421842) That is to say, it exhibits intelligence and will.
('36', 212, 2, 5, 421893) To suppose that life separates differentiates and segregates by a process that is purely mechanistic is inconceivable.
('36', 212, 2, 6, 422012) True, these fundamental processes are so far removed from our present conscious ness as to seem to be uncontrolled by the human or animal will.
('36', 212, 2, 7, 422156) But a moment’s reflection will show that just as the will of the fully developed human being directs his external movements and actions in accordance with the guidance of the intellect—this, indeed, being its function so the earlier processes of the gradual organization of the body must, within the limits provided by environment be allowed to be directed by a kind of will guided by a kind of intelligence.
('36', 212, 2, 8, 422565) This is now known to psychologists as” the uncon scious.” It is a part of ourself, disconnected from our normal daily thinking, but intensely awake and regard in regard to its own functions—so much so that it never for a moment subsides into sleep as the consciousness does.
('36', 212, 2, 9, 422840) Who can measure the almost irreparable harm done to the unconscious and more permanent part of our being by the sexual act indulged for its own sake?
('36', 212, 3, 10, 422990) The nemesis of reproduction is death.
('36', 212, 3, 11, 423028) The sexual act is essentially katabolic (or a movement towards death) in the male and in parturition of the offspring it is katabolic for the female.
('36', 212, 3, 12, 423178) Hence the writer contends:
('36', 212, 4, 13, 423205) Virility, vitality and immunity from disease are the normal lot of nearly or quite continent persons.
('36', 212, 4, 14, 423307) Withdrawal of germ cells from their upward regenerative course for generative or merely indulgent purposes deprives the organs of their replenishing stock of life, to their cost slowly and ultimately.
('36', 212, 4, 15, 423508) It is these physical facts which constitute the basis of a personal sexual ethic, counselling moderation, if not restraint—at any rate, explaining the origin of restraint.
('36', 212, 4, 16, 423680) The author, as can be easily imagined, is opposed to birth control by chemical and mechanical means.
('36', 212, 4, 17, 423781) He says:
('36', 212, 5, 18, 423790) It removes all prudential motives for self restraint and makes it possi ble for sexual indulgence in marriage to be limited only by the diminution of desire or the advance of old age.
('36', 212, 5, 19, 423974) Apart from this, however, it inevitably has an influence outside the marriage relation.
('36', 212, 5, 20, 424062) It opens the door for irregular, promiscuous and unfruitful unions, which from the point of view of modern industry, sociology and politics, are full of danger.
('36', 212, 5, 21, 424223) I cannot go into these
('36', 213, 0, 1, 424246) 214 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 213, 1, 2, 424288) It is sufficient to say that by contraception, inordinate sexual indulgence both in and out of marriage is facilitated and, if I am right in my foregoing physiological arguments, evil must come to both individuals and the race.
('36', 213, 1, 3, 424516) Let the Indian youth treasure in their hearts the quotation with which M. Bureau’s book ends:

('36', 213, 4, 7, 424695) Professor Malkani draws my attention to two ‘sad misprints’ in his last article last week.
('36', 213, 4, 8, 424786) In the third paragraph of the second column ‘quickly’ should have been ‘quietly’ and ‘clever’ should have been ‘clear’.

('36', 213, 7, 11, 424954) The untouchable is not the only portion of suppressed humanity!
('36', 213, 7, 12, 425018) The young widow in Hindu society is no less so.
('36', 213, 7, 13, 425066) A correspondent from Bengal writes:
('36', 213, 8, 14, 425102) There is no restriction among Muslims about widow remarriage, but there is provision for a man to marry up to four wives and as a matter of fact many Muslims have more than one wife.
('36', 213, 8, 15, 425285) So none of the Muslim male population remains unmarried.
('36', 213, 8, 16, 425342) Is it not therefore true that where there is no restriction against widow remarriage the number of females is much in excess of males?
('36', 213, 8, 17, 425477) In other words is it not true that in the communities in which widow remarriage is allowed, polygamy should also be allowed?
('36', 213, 9, 18, 425602) If widow remarriage is made common among Hindus, will not young widows induce young men to marry them and make it difficult, rather impossible, to find out bridegrooms for unmarried girls?
('36', 213, 10, 19, 425791) Will not unmarried girls then commit all the sins which are committed or are presumed to be committed by widows, if there be no provision to keep more than one wife by a Hindu?

('36', 214, 2, 3, 426307) consideration in recommending widow remarriage.
('36', 214, 2, 4, 426355) In his zeal to prevent widows from remarrying, the correspon dent has ignored many things.
('36', 214, 2, 5, 426446) Mussalmans have, indeed, the right to take more than one wife but the vast majority of them have only one wife.
('36', 214, 2, 6, 426558) The correspondent does not seem to know that, unfortunately, there is no prohibition against Polygamy in Hinduism.
('36', 214, 2, 7, 426673) Hindus in highest circles have been known to marry more than one wife.
('36', 214, 2, 8, 426744) Many princes marry an unlimited number.
('36', 214, 2, 9, 426784) The correspondent further forgets the fact that it is only among the so called higher classes that widow remarriage is prohibited.
('36', 214, 2, 10, 426915) Among the vast majority belonging to the fourth division, widows freely remarry, but no untoward consequences have taken place.
('36', 214, 2, 11, 427043) Though free to take more wives than one, they are as a rule satisfied with one companion at a time.
('36', 214, 3, 12, 427143) The suggestion that young widows will take up all young men and leave none for unmarried girls betrays a woeful want of sense of proportion.
('36', 214, 3, 13, 427284) The excessive anxiety for the chastity of young girls bet rays an unhealthy mind.
('36', 214, 3, 14, 427366) The limited number of widows remarrying can never leave a large number of young girls unmarried.
('36', 214, 3, 15, 427463) And in any event, if ever such a problem arose it would be found to be due to the early marriages that take place today.
('36', 214, 3, 16, 427584) The remedy in anticipation is to prevent early marriages.
('36', 214, 4, 17, 427642) Of the love, the sanctity of grahastha life, etc., where there is a widow of tender age, the less said the better.
('36', 214, 5, 18, 427757) But the correspondent has missed the whole of my point.
('36', 214, 5, 19, 427813) I have never advocated widow remarriage on a wholesale scale.
('36', 214, 5, 20, 427875) The statistics collected by Sir Ganga Ram and summarized in these pages deal with widows up to 15 years only.
('36', 214, 5, 21, 427985) These poor, wretched beings know nothing of Pativrata dharma.
('36', 214, 5, 22, 428047) They are strangers to love.
('36', 214, 5, 23, 428075) The truer statement would be to say that these girls were never married at all.
('36', 214, 5, 24, 428155) If marriage is, as it ought to be, a sacrament, an entrance into a new life, the girls to be married should be fully developed, should have some hand in the choice of companions for life’ and should know the consequences of their acts.
('36', 214, 5, 25, 428391) It is a crime against God and man to call the union of the children a married state and then to decree widowhood for a girl whose so called husband is dead.
('36', 214, 5, 26, 428548) I do believe that a real Hindu widow is a treasure.

('36', 215, 4, 7, 428895) THE WHEEL IN MUNICIPAL SCHOOLS
('36', 215, 5, 8, 428926) There are 108 girls and 41 boys spinning in the schools under the Lucknow Municipal Board.
('36', 215, 5, 9, 429017) There are 93 wheels in the girls’ schools and 15 in the boys’ schools.
('36', 215, 5, 10, 429088) The former spin 27 tolas and the latter 4 tolas per month.
('36', 215, 5, 11, 429147) Each wheel costs the municipality Rs. 2 per month.
('36', 215, 5, 12, 429198) The Superintendent of Education considers the progress ‘quite satisfactory beginning to start with, though not very encouraging’.
('36', 215, 5, 13, 429328) It can be considered satisfactory only in the sense that it may be better than nothing.
('36', 215, 5, 14, 429416) But in my opinion the output of yarn is ridiculously small and the expense per charkha is monstrously large.
('36', 215, 5, 15, 429525) Indeed there should be hardly any, apart from the initial outlay.
('36', 215, 5, 16, 429591) Nothing is stated as to the quality of yarn.
('36', 215, 5, 17, 429636) I must repeat what I have said before.
('36', 215, 5, 18, 429675) The takli is the thing for schools and it should be only introduced when the existing staff has learnt carding and spinning.
('36', 215, 5, 19, 429800) Spinning in schools can never become a success unless the teachers realize its national importance, take pleasure in it, and by their own zeal make it interesting for the pupils.
('36', 215, 6, 20, 429979) BIHAR KHADI EXHIBITION
('36', 215, 7, 21, 430002) The khadi exhibitions in Bihar continue to prosper and attract increasing attention.
('36', 215, 7, 22, 430087) The month of July began with an exhibition at Bettiah.
('36', 215, 7, 23, 430142) It was opened by Mr. Prior, the manager of the Raj.
('36', 215, 7, 24, 430194) The assistant manager Mr. Wylde and the S.D.O. were present at the opening ceremony.
('36', 215, 7, 25, 430279) Mr. Prior did not think that ‘‘any Englishman ever considered khaddar as a poor thing,” but he said,” it should be carried on as a home industry”.
('36', 215, 7, 26, 430426) The sales effected were Rs. 1,304 12 3. The second exhibition was held at Motihari.
('36', 215, 7, 27, 430510) The Rev.
('36', 215, 7, 28, 430519) J. Z. Hodge performed the opening ceremony.
('36', 215, 7, 29, 430563) He had three reasons for supporting the khaddar movement: First,” Support home industry”; second khaddar had sentiment and love behind it; third, khaddar gave food to the poor.
('36', 215, 7, 30, 430740) The sales in Motihari amounted to Rs. 1,162 8 9. The third exhibition was held at Laheria serai, Darbhanga.

('36', 216, 4, 8, 431174) Today Hindi Navajivan enters its sixth year.
('36', 216, 4, 9, 431219) Although it is running at a loss, it is being continued by the love of friends.
('36', 216, 4, 10, 431299) I have read what Jamnalalji has written.
('36', 216, 4, 11, 431340) If Hindi Navajivan serves a purpose, it must go on ; but it must then be self supporting.
('36', 216, 4, 12, 431430) I appeal to the readers to make sure that the paper does not have to depend on the charity of friends.
('36', 216, 4, 13, 431533) There used to be errors of language in Hindi Navajivan.
('36', 216, 4, 14, 431589) I think they have now been done away with.
('36', 216, 4, 15, 431632) Two Hindi lovers from North India do the translation for Hindi Navajivan.
('36', 216, 4, 16, 431706) The risk of errors has, therefore, considerably lessened.

('36', 216, 9, 22, 431943) BHAISHRI PUNJABHAI, I have gone through the translation of Manache Shloka 1 fairly carefully.
('36', 216, 9, 23, 432037) I felt that it contained quite a few errors.
('36', 216, 9, 24, 432082) It was beyond my capacity to examine it very closely.
('36', 216, 9, 25, 432136) Besides, my knowledge of Marathi is not much.
('36', 216, 9, 26, 432182) I would, therefore, advise you to get it thoroughly revised by a scholar who knows both Marathi and Gujarati.

('36', 218, 6, 7, 433925) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, August 20, 1926
('36', 218, 7, 8, 433964) MY DEAR CHILD,
('36', 218, 8, 9, 433979) I have your letter.
('36', 218, 8, 10, 433999) I did not misunderstand your remark about typewriters.
('36', 218, 8, 11, 434054) On the contrary, I liked it.
('36', 218, 8, 12, 434083) The literal meaning of an ‘ashram’ is an abode, but the associations about the ashram are these: It should be simple.
('36', 218, 8, 13, 434201) It should not be merely a teaching institution.
('36', 218, 8, 14, 434249) It should contain predominantly those who are pledged to perpetual continence.
('36', 218, 8, 15, 434328) It should have associations of sannyasa, meaning detachment from the world.
('36', 218, 8, 16, 434404) It should, therefore, be a voluntarily poor organization.
('36', 218, 8, 17, 434462) There should, therefore, be rigid simplicity about it.
('36', 218, 8, 18, 434517) Its object must invariably be formation of character with a view to self realization.
('36', 218, 8, 19, 434603) The idea of master and servant is wholly repugnant to such an institution.
('36', 218, 8, 20, 434678) All men and women in an ashram are expected to do bodily labour and all enjoy an equal status.
('36', 218, 8, 21, 434773) The idea of superiority has no place in it.
('36', 218, 8, 22, 434817) The head of an ashram is in the place of a parent and he is expected to regard the rest as his own children.
('36', 218, 8, 23, 434926) I wonder if I have now given you fairly the characteristics of an ashram.
('36', 218, 8, 24, 435000) It grieves me whenever I find that a medical man is weak or ailing.
('36', 218, 8, 25, 435068) It is a perpetual reminder to us that medicine is such an incomplete, such an unreliable, and such an empirical science.
('36', 218, 8, 26, 435189) If we think about it with sufficient detachment, we would at once realize its inherent weakness by understanding that there is no such thing as an absolute cure.
('36', 218, 8, 27, 435351) The most potent drugs admit of innumerable exceptions.
('36', 218, 8, 28, 435406) The most successful operation leaves literally and in the

('36', 219, 1, 3, 435564) It would certainly be a good thing, if you could hasten your departure for Denmark.
('36', 219, 1, 4, 435648) Change of climate will be the best cure.
('36', 219, 1, 5, 435689) What you say about fasting is quite true.
('36', 219, 1, 6, 435731) It has no absolute value and it certainly does not produce the slightest spiritual effect if the motive behind it is not really spiritual.
('36', 219, 1, 7, 435870) Fasting with a mixed motive ends with purely material results.
('36', 219, 1, 8, 435933) But fasting for the sake of unfoldment of the spirit is a discipline I hold to be absolutely necessary at some stage or other in the evolution of an individual.
('36', 219, 1, 9, 436094) I always considered Protestantism to be deficient in this particular.
('36', 219, 1, 10, 436164) Every other religion of any importance appreciates the spiritual value of fasting.
('36', 219, 1, 11, 436247) Crucifixion of the flesh is a meaningless term unless one goes voluntarily through pangs of hunger.
('36', 219, 1, 12, 436347) For one thing, identif ication with the starving poor is a meaningless term without the experience behind.
('36', 219, 1, 13, 436454) But I quite agree that even an eighty days’ fast may fail to rid a person of pride, selfishness, ambitions and the like.
('36', 219, 1, 14, 436575) Fasting is merely a prop.
('36', 219, 1, 15, 436601) But as a prop to a tottering structure is of inestimable value, so is the prop of fasting of inestimable value for a struggling soul.

('36', 220, 5, 6, 437596) DEAR SISTER 1, It was a delight to receive your letter, it would seem, after ages.
('36', 220, 5, 7, 437679) Do you want me to write to Sir Henry Lawrence directly or to prepare a note for you which you can send?
('36', 220, 5, 8, 437783) Whilst your answer is quite good, he must have all the satisfaction that one can give him in the way of statistics.
('36', 220, 5, 9, 437899) After all the trouble one may take, it is just possible what may appear to us to be solid and tangible may not appear so to him.
('36', 220, 5, 10, 438028) But that does not matter as the inspirer of The Song Celestial 2 would say.
('36', 220, 5, 11, 438104) We must act with detachment and leave the results to God.
('36', 220, 5, 12, 438162) I observe that, as behoves a good girl, your postscript is as long as your letter and, perhaps, more important.
('36', 220, 5, 13, 438274) Please tell the sceptical sister that the revival of the spinning wheel has actually rescued from destruction many arts and crafts.
('36', 220, 5, 14, 438406) Does she think that there was no art in India before we received silk thread from China and Paris which we began doing only a hundred years ago or less?
('36', 220, 5, 15, 438559) When spinning and waving were at their height, we were in possession of the highest art and all the art on fabric one sees now is a copy of the Indian original.
('36', 220, 5, 16, 438720) Personally, I do not mind the use of Chinese silk for embroidery.
('36', 220, 5, 17, 438786) But those who are afraid of art destruction may use as much as they like of Chinese thread so long as the background is hand spun khaddar.
('36', 220, 5, 18, 438925) No amount of travelling and appeals to newspapers, etc., can possibly rescue Indian art from destruction if we cannot rescue ourselves as a nation from destruction.
('36', 220, 5, 19, 439090) Revival of Indian art will only come when we develop love enough for our country to enable us to cling to one another and sink our differences and to sacrifice our all for the sake of the country.
('36', 220, 5, 20, 439287) The best way, therefore, to preserve and revive the Indian art is for us to become sufficiently Indian ourselves.

('36', 221, 5, 9, 440038) 251. MY NOTES
('36', 221, 6, 10, 440052) NATIONAL SCHOOLS
('36', 221, 7, 11, 440069) There seems to be some misunderstanding regarding the article in which I wrote about National Schools in the Navajivan of August 8. The Principal of the Rashtriya Vinay Mandir in Bombay has written to me as follows:
('36', 221, 8, 12, 440285) You have given it as your opinion in that article that national schools should be closed now, and so one of the donors of the Vinay Mandir says that he need give us nothing now.
('36', 221, 8, 13, 440463) The passage which has been thus misunderstood read as follows:
('36', 221, 9, 14, 440526) Where the parents are fired by national ideals and prove their adhesion by giving adequate donations for the support of national schools, and, where the teachers being themselves believers in the national ideal are ceaselessly striving to enforce it, I can understand a relaxation of the discipline if the scholars are lukewarm about the ideal.
('36', 221, 9, 15, 440871) In such a case, it may be necessary to continue the school.
('36', 221, 9, 16, 440931) For we may hope some day to influence the scholars.
('36', 221, 9, 17, 440983) But at the time of writing these lines, I can think of no such school.
('36', 221, 10, 18, 441054) The last sentence of this paragraph has been misunderstood.
('36', 221, 10, 19, 441114) It has been taken to mean that I do not regard any of the national schools fit enough to be continued.
('36', 221, 10, 20, 441217) There is another sentence in that paragraph, the first one, which states what type of school should be closed down:
('36', 221, 11, 21, 441333) 1 Theis paragraph is taken from Young India, 2 9 1926.
('36', 222, 0, 1, 441388) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 223
('36', 222, 1, 2, 441433) Where either the parents or the teachers are opposed to the national ideal, the school should certainly be closed.
('36', 222, 2, 3, 441548) In the case of the Vinay Mandir in Bombay, as in the case of many other such schools, we know that the parents and teachers are in agreement with the ideals of national education.
('36', 222, 2, 4, 441728) They want national schools to be run in accordance with the ideal of national education as defined by the Congress.
('36', 222, 2, 5, 441844) Schools which are so run need not be closed down.
('36', 222, 2, 6, 441894) The sentences which followed were intended to point out that in such cases it would not be wrong, even if the pupils obstinately refused to wear khadi and fulfil other conditions, to keep the schools going and so give the pupils an opportunity to change.
('36', 222, 2, 7, 442149) I stated at the conclusion of the paragraph,” I can think of no such school.” What I meant was that, if there were any national schools where both the parents and the teachers were in agreement with its ideals and active in promoting them and yet the pupils obstinately disregarded the rules about khadi, etc., I should certainly like to know their names.
('36', 222, 2, 8, 442505) As regards the Rashtriya Vinay Mandir in Bombay, my impression is that there even the pupils are filled with the national spirit and wear khadi and spin.
('36', 222, 2, 9, 442659) There can be no question of closing down such a school.
('36', 222, 2, 10, 442715) I hope that generous hearted men will continue to help such schools.

('36', 225, 2, 9, 446836) We shall of course have to obtain afterwards the committee’s permission for that.
('36', 225, 2, 10, 446918) I have asked Ramnarayan not to incur any expenditure meanwhile.
('36', 225, 2, 11, 446982) It has been decided that the pupils who may join the class should be accommodated in the Mahavidyalaya building.
('36', 225, 2, 12, 447095) If you can, come over for a while and examine the position.

('36', 225, 6, 18, 447401) The manager of the khadi store conducted in the office of the Pranidaya Dhyanpracharak Sangh, Davengere, Mysore, reports that the municipal council of that place has removed the octroi duty imposed on imports of khadi.
('36', 225, 6, 19, 447620) This is an example to be copied by every municipality.
('36', 225, 6, 20, 447675) It is the least that municipalities can do for the revival of the ancient industry.
('36', 225, 6, 21, 447759) Let me repeat for the thousandth time that khadi means cloth woven on a handloom out of hand spun yarn.

('36', 227, 0, 1, 449073) 228 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 227, 1, 2, 449115) As against 3,379 persons who enrolled themselves as members only 1,231, i.e., 36 per cent have paid their quota of yarn to date.
('36', 227, 1, 3, 449244) Assam with only l p.c.
('36', 227, 1, 4, 449267) full subscribers comes by far the last on the list.
('36', 227, 1, 5, 449319) Andhra is the next offender with 24 p.c.
('36', 227, 1, 6, 449360) Burma tops the list wth 83 p.c., but it is no wonder since it had only 6 members to start with.
('36', 227, 2, 7, 449456) These figures show that people do not like regularity, they do not like to work steadily for the country.
('36', 227, 2, 8, 449562) The spirit of sustained sacrifice is lacking.
('36', 227, 2, 9, 449608) No one need imagine that with monetary subscriptions the conditions will be much better.
('36', 227, 2, 10, 449697) Where is the public worker who has had no painful experience of arrears?
('36', 227, 2, 11, 449770) I remember the complaints of old Congress Secretaries when the A.I.C.C. subscription used to be a lump sum.
('36', 227, 2, 12, 449878) Negligence is ingrained among many workers.
('36', 227, 2, 13, 449922) Public work has not yet risen from the status of a pastime or patronage to that of a primary duty.
('36', 227, 2, 14, 450021) And yet for one who desires a healthy social and public life, public service is as much a duty as is service done to oneself or to one’s family.
('36', 227, 2, 15, 450166) May not the ancient five sacrifices be renamed sacrifice for self, family, village, nation and humanity?
('36', 227, 2, 16, 450271) That life only is worth living in which there is a harm onious correlation, no antagonism, among the several sacrifices.
('36', 227, 2, 17, 450392) The spinning subscription is a national sacrifice of the lightest measure, not in conflict with the requirements of humanity, and certainly not in conflict with those of the village, family or the individual.
('36', 227, 3, 18, 450601) For me, therefore, the lesson that this study in figures teaches is not one of despair, nor of revising the nature of the subscription or the method of paying it.
('36', 227, 3, 19, 450764) The more I study the spinning movement, the more convinced I become of the soundness of requiring and giving steady daily labour of half an hour at least at the spinning wheel and of keeping up the present rate of subscription.
('36', 227, 3, 20, 450992) Even if the 1,231 members keep up the regular supply, without fuss, without interruption, the discipline will revolutionize their lives and the subscribers will be found to be fit instruments for national service when the supreme test comes, as it must some day.
('36', 227, 4, 21, 451255) The largest number of steady workers is derived today from this body of regular spinners.
('36', 227, 4, 22, 451345) The statistics I am collecting and publishing, as regularly as I can get them, must open the eyes of all unbiased thinkers to the usefulness of the only immediate remedy for the growing distress of the poor millions and to the only real link between the cultured few and the starving many.
('36', 227, 4, 23, 451635) Babu Rajendra Prasad has well said in his eloquent defence of khaddar:
('36', 228, 0, 1, 451706) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 229
('36', 228, 1, 2, 451751) But people may say why should we pay this higher price?
('36', 228, 1, 3, 451807) What after all is the good of reviving this dead industry?
('36', 228, 1, 4, 451866) Only those can put this question who have not sufficiently realized the grinding poverty of the masses of the people of this country.
('36', 228, 1, 5, 452000) All a priori economics is mute in the appalling
('36', 228, 2, 6, 452048) presence of this chill penury which freezes the genial current of the soul.
('36', 228, 2, 7, 452124) I will give only one figure which is a rough figure but which is none the less reliable.
('36', 228, 2, 8, 452213) In 1922, we distributed no less than Rs. 26,000 by way of wages to weavers and spinners.
('36', 228, 2, 9, 452302) In 1925 we paid no less than Rs. 46,000 out of which Rs. 28,000 was paid to spinners alone—spinners who could not have earned anything if they did not spin.
('36', 228, 2, 10, 452459) These figures relate only to the organization under the direct control of the Congress in this province.
('36', 228, 2, 11, 452564) They do not include the figures of the Gandhi Kutir whose work until recently was even more extensive than that of the Congress Khaddar Bhandar.
('36', 228, 2, 12, 452709) I ask in all solemnity what other organization is there in this province which can afford to distribute over a lakh to people who would otherwise earn nothing and to whom it gives what it gives not by way of charity but as wages honestly earned?
('36', 228, 2, 13, 452955) Khaddar is really a life giving industry and to revive it is to furnish food to countless starving persons.
('36', 228, 2, 14, 453063) It blesses those who give and those who receive it, as it is not mere charity, and creates in the recipient a sense of self respect while at the same time making the distributor humble.
('36', 228, 2, 15, 453249) And what is true of Bihar is true of every province.
('36', 228, 2, 16, 453302) The A.I.S.A. is operating with over Rs. 18,00,000 throughout the whole of India.
('36', 228, 2, 17, 453383) The bulk of the returns goes directly into the pockets of those who would otherwise be workless.
('36', 228, 2, 18, 453480) Let the sceptics peruse the figures.
('36', 228, 2, 19, 453517) If they have better use for the money, better employment for the workless paupers, let them say so.
('36', 228, 2, 20, 453617) If not, it is up to them to lend a helping hand to this great and growing movement which is as much moral and economic as it is political.
('36', 228, 2, 21, 453756) Its moral and economic effect is immediate and tangible, its political effect is distant and derivable from the first two, not independent of them.
('36', 228, 2, 22, 453904) Let those who are in arrears beware!
('36', 228, 2, 23, 453941) At the end of the year, they will find their names struck off, if they do not wake up and spin and send the yarn they have hitherto neglected to Spin and send.
('36', 228, 2, 24, 454101) Debts of honour have priority over those enforceable in a court of law.
('36', 228, 2, 25, 454173) The spinning subscription is a national debt of honour.

('36', 229, 1, 2, 454294) 259. CURSE OF CHILD MARRIAGE
('36', 229, 2, 3, 454323) Mrs. Margaret E. Cousins has sent me notes of a tragic case that appears to have just occurred in Madras and has arisen out of a child marriage, the girl being 13 years and the ‘husband’ 26. Hardly had the pair lived together for 13 days when the girl died of burning.
('36', 229, 2, 4, 454592) The jury have found that she committed suicide owing to the unbearable and inhuman solicitations of the so called husband.
('36', 229, 2, 5, 454715) The dying deposition of the girl would go to show that the ‘husband’ had set fire to her clothes.
('36', 229, 2, 6, 454813) Passion knows no prudence, no pity.
('36', 229, 2, 7, 454849) But how the girl died is beside the point.
('36', 229, 2, 8, 454892) The indisputable facts are: (1) that the girl was married when she was only 13; (2) that she had no sexual desire inasmuch as she resisted the advances of the ‘husband’; (3) that the ‘husband’ did make cruel advances; (4) and that she is now no more.
('36', 229, 3, 9, 455143) It is irreligion, not religion, to give religious sanction to a brutal custom.
('36', 229, 3, 10, 455222) The smritis bristle with contradictions.
('36', 229, 3, 11, 455263) The only reasonable deduction to be drawn from the contradictions is that the texts that may be contrary to known and accepted morality, more especially, to the moral precepts enjoined in the smritis themselves, must be rejected as interpolations.
('36', 229, 3, 12, 455511) Inspiring verses on self restraint could not be written at the same time and by the same pen that wrote the verses encouraging the brute in man.
('36', 229, 3, 13, 455656) Only a man innocent of self restraint and steeped in vice could call it a sin not to marry a girl before she reached the age of monthly periods.
('36', 229, 3, 14, 455801) It should be held sinful to marry a girl for several years after the periods begin.
('36', 229, 3, 15, 455885) There cannot be even the thought of marriage before the periods begin.
('36', 229, 3, 16, 455956) A girl is no more fit to bear children on beginning the periods than a lad is to procreate as soon as he grows the first hair on his upper lip.
('36', 229, 4, 17, 456100) The custom of child marriage is a moral as well as a physical evil.
('36', 229, 4, 18, 456168) For it undermines our morals and induces physical degeneration.
('36', 229, 4, 19, 456232) By countenancing such customs we recede from God as well as swaraj.
('36', 229, 4, 20, 456300) A man who has no thought of the tender age of a girl has none of God.
('36', 229, 4, 21, 456370) And undergrown men have no capacity for fighting battles of freedom or, having gained it, of retaining it.
('36', 229, 4, 22, 456477) Fight for swaraj means not mere political awakening but an all round awakening—social, educational, moral, economic and political.

('36', 230, 1, 2, 456653) Legislation is being promoted to raise the age of consent.
('36', 230, 1, 3, 456712) It may be good for bringing a minority to book.
('36', 230, 1, 4, 456760) But it is not legislation that will cure a popular evil, it is enlightened public opinion that can do it.
('36', 230, 1, 5, 456866) I am not opposed to legislation in such matters but I do lay greater stress on cultivation of public opinion.
('36', 230, 1, 6, 456976) The Madras case would have been impossible if there had been a living public opinion against child marriages.
('36', 230, 1, 7, 457086) The young man in question is not an illiterate labourer but an intelligent educated typist.
('36', 230, 1, 8, 457178) It would have been impossible for him to marry or touch the girl if public opinion had been against the marriage or the consummation of the marriage of girls of tender age.
('36', 230, 1, 9, 457351) Ordinarily, a girl under 18 years should never be given in marriage.

('36', 230, 4, 12, 457454) PANDIT MALAVIYAJI AND THE BENGAL GOVERNMENT
('36', 230, 5, 13, 457498) The Government of Bengal may well congratulate itself upon the courage it has shown in retracing its steps and dropping the proceedings against Pandit Malaviyaji and Dr. Moonje for their civil disobedience.
('36', 230, 5, 14, 457705) 1 But one could wish that there was grace about the withdrawal of these proceedings.
('36', 230, 5, 15, 457790) The Standing Counsel for the Government of Bengal made a statement which, I think, was highly offensive.
('36', 230, 5, 16, 457895) There is no regret shown on behalf of the Government, no apology offered to the distinguished patriots, but, on the contrary, a veiled suggestion that there was possibly some connection between Panditji’s presence in Calcutta and the riots that took place although the Standing Counsel is obliged to admit that there was nothing offensive or provocative in Panditji’s speech on the strength of which the prohibition order was taken out.
('36', 230, 5, 17, 458332) Surely, it was up to the officials who took the proceedings to see the full text of the speech before applying for an order under Section 144, especially when the order was to be against persons so well known in public life as Pandit Malaviyaji and Dr. Moonje.
('36', 230, 5, 18, 458593) If it was a private party that had acted so hastily as the Government of Bengal seem to have done in this case, that party would have rendered itself liable to an action for damages.
('36', 230, 5, 19, 458776) If public opinion was well organized and strong, it could bring to

('36', 231, 1, 2, 458935) book a Government that acted so rashly and recklessly as the Bengal Government have done.
('36', 231, 1, 3, 459025) In the face of that proceedings is it any wonder that complaint is often heard that proceedings are often thoughtlessly, hastily, and sometimes even vindictively, taken against innocent persons in virtue of arbitrary powers taken by the Government under laws in the framing of which they have had the most part?
('36', 231, 2, 4, 459337) ‘SQUEEZING OUT’
('36', 231, 3, 5, 459353) A letter from South Africa states:
('36', 231, 4, 6, 459388) The policy of squeezing out or” civilizing labour” in all Government Departments is proceeding apace and in the Railway Department at Pietermaritzburg and Ladysmith hundreds of Indians have been given notice, in some cases of thirteen days only, to transfer to Durban or get out of the service.
('36', 231, 4, 7, 459683) This is being done with people who have given 25 to 30 years to the service at one and the same place.
('36', 231, 4, 8, 459786) To these poor illiterate people who have given the best part of their lives to the services, a transfer is a change to a new world and I am made to understand that in a Large number of cases they are leaving the service and getting repatriated to India.
('36', 231, 4, 9, 460040) The alternative of transfer to Durban is really no alternative to leaving the service.
('36', 231, 4, 10, 460127) And those who do go to Durban must ultimately come under the ban when the ‘civilizing’ process reaches Durban.
('36', 231, 4, 11, 460238) What hurts one however is not the notices but the indecent hurry with which the policy of extirpation of the Asiatic is being pursued in spite of the fact that very soon a conference is to sit to consider the question of the status of Asiatics in South Africa.
('36', 231, 4, 12, 460499) But let us wait, prepare the atmosphere for the coming South African deputation and hope for the best.
('36', 231, 5, 13, 460602) THE COLOUR BAR BILL
('36', 231, 6, 14, 460622) The following letter from the Department of Mines and Industries, South Africa, to the local Indian Congress is the finish to the Colour Bar Bill:
('36', 231, 7, 15, 460769) With reference to your telegram dated the 14th instant addressed to His Excellency the Governor General regarding the Mines and Works Act Amendment Bill, I am directed to inform you that it is the intention of the Government in due course to consider the issue of regulations to restore at all events the status quo as it existed before the Courts declared certain regulations ultra vires.
('36', 231, 7, 16, 461159) This is necessary in the interests of health and safety.
('36', 231, 8, 17, 461216) There is no present intention of extending the regulations beyond the
('36', 232, 0, 1, 461286) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 233
('36', 232, 1, 2, 461331) position as it existed prior to the Court’s judgment.
('36', 232, 1, 3, 461385) Should any such extension be contemplated in the future every reasonable opportunity will be given to all parties in the Union interested in the matter to make representations.
('36', 232, 2, 4, 461562) In the circumstances no good purpose would appear to be served by granting the interview proposed.
('36', 232, 2, 5, 461661) It means no relief to the community except that no drastic measures are to be immediately taken.
('36', 232, 2, 6, 461758) It contains no guarantee that no such steps will be taken in future.
('36', 232, 2, 7, 461827) On the contrary, the community has been gently prepared for its enforcement.
('36', 232, 2, 8, 461904) As I have remarked before, a bad law is bad, whether it is immediately enforced or hung like the sword of Damocles over the heads of those affected by it.
('36', 232, 3, 9, 462059) ITS AWFUL CONSEQUENCES
('36', 232, 4, 10, 462082) A correspondent sends me a long article on child marriage and enforced widowhood in Bengal.
('36', 232, 4, 11, 462174) He says:
('36', 232, 5, 12, 462183) You are surely aware that the condition of Hindu society in other provinces is no better, if not worse, than that prevailing in Bengal.
('36', 232, 5, 13, 462319) Early marriage and girl widowhood exist in a specially virulent form amongst the depressed classes of Hindu society.
('36', 232, 5, 14, 462436) In Bengal it is very frequent amongst Dam, Chamar, Namasudra, Kaibarta (fishermen) classes.
('36', 232, 5, 15, 462528) These people on the other hand form the bulk of Hindu population in Bengal.
('36', 232, 5, 16, 462604) I wish I had time and opportunity to study and prepare similar figures for other provinces.
('36', 232, 5, 17, 462696) The article bristles with figures which are in the main included in the summary which I reproduced a fortnight ago fromSir Gangaram’s statistics.
('36', 232, 5, 18, 462842) 1 The following conclusions drawn by the writer are interesting and instructive:
('36', 232, 6, 19, 462923) It is sapping the vitality of thousands of our promising boys and girls on whom the future of our society entirely rests.
('36', 232, 6, 20, 463045) It is bringing into existence every year thousands of weaklings both boys and girls—who are born of immature parenthood.
('36', 232, 6, 21, 463166) It is a very fruitful source of appalling child mortality and stillbirths that now prevail in our society.
('36', 232, 6, 22, 463273) It is bringing into existence thousands of girl widows every year who in their turn are a source of corruption and dangerous infection to the society.
('36', 232, 6, 23, 463424) It is a very important cause of the gradual and steady decline of Hindu society in point of (1) number, (2) physical strength and courage and (3) morality.

('36', 233, 1, 2, 463684) 261. ‘WHY ONLY YOURS?’
('36', 233, 2, 3, 463707) Lala Shamal of Hissar writes:
('36', 233, 3, 4, 463737) Some time ago I read an article by you in Young India 1 headed” The Cobwebs of Ignorance”.
('36', 233, 3, 5, 463828) In this article you said inter alia that the spinning wheel was necessary for the economic salvation of India and that therefore it was necessary that every Indian worked it either by way of sacrifice or otherwise.
('36', 233, 3, 6, 464043) You also said there that it was the gateway of spiritual salvation for yourself.
('36', 233, 3, 7, 464124) But why for yourself only?
('36', 233, 3, 8, 464151) Let us examine this proposition in the light of two great civilizations of the earth, viz., that of the East (Aryan) and that of the West (Grecian).
('36', 233, 3, 9, 464300) Excepting perhaps Kabir and Nanak, the two great rishis of India in the middle ages, who have gone much higher and have symbolized the charkha with the great force of the universe (cosmic energy, life or Prana) every rishi in India either in the middle ages or in ancient times has pointed out that the charkha was the gateway to woman’s salvation.
('36', 233, 4, 10, 464649) The Upanishads say that the Lord of Creation desiring the creation produced at first a pair—life and food—and with these two forces He created the sun and the moon as life and food respectively and so on till the whole creation was made.
('36', 233, 4, 11, 464887) Man and woman were produced as life and food, respectively.
('36', 233, 4, 12, 464947) These two forces united together made the whole (world).
('36', 233, 4, 13, 465004) The following Vedic Mantra is recited just before homa and saptapadi:
('36', 233, 5, 14, 465074) “O bride!
('36', 233, 5, 15, 465084) look here, I have brought these clothes for you.
('36', 233, 5, 16, 465133) These are sacred clothes made by devis (women) of my country by carding the cotton and by spinning and weaving with their own hands.
('36', 233, 5, 17, 465266) Wear these with faith and get yourself entitled to perform the yajna with me.
('36', 233, 5, 18, 465344) I pray that the same devis may continue to supply you with such clothes and may continue to wear them for lifelong years.
('36', 233, 6, 19, 465466) Thus according to the ancient Aryan philosophy one who has not understood the charkha cannot understand his self or the universe and cannot realize Brahman just as one who has not understood vyashti (individual) can never realize samashti (whole).
('36', 233, 6, 20, 465714) Now let us see what the Western (Greek) civilization, of which Christianity and Islam are but later developments, says in this matter.
('36', 233, 6, 21, 465849) Everyone knows the lines:” When Adam delved and Eve span who was then the gentleman?” According to this the duty of the husband was to till the ground and that of the wife was to spin and weave.

('36', 234, 0, 1, 466101) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 235
('36', 234, 1, 2, 466146) Wife comes from a root meaning to weave just as the name Uma, the consort of Shiva, means in Sanskrit one who weaves.
('36', 234, 1, 3, 466264) Thus the Western philosophy regarding charkha seems also to take us to the same idea as the Aryan philosophy.
('36', 234, 1, 4, 466374) Now nationality is the outcome of two forces united together, viz, politics and religion.
('36', 234, 1, 5, 466464) One is nothing without the other.
('36', 234, 1, 6, 466498) While the former is the establishment of a spirit of equality outside, the latter is the realization of the spirit of oneness within.
('36', 234, 1, 7, 466632) Economic salvation as a branch of politics can do no good unless it is joined with the other force of religion.
('36', 234, 1, 8, 466744) I wish I could say with my correspondent that the charkha is the gateway to the salvation of all.
('36', 234, 1, 9, 466842) But he must recognize my limitations.
('36', 234, 1, 10, 466880) I have to write as well for sceptics as for believers.
('36', 234, 1, 11, 466935) The authorities and arguments addressed by Lala Shamlal will not, I fear, appeal to the sceptic.
('36', 234, 1, 12, 467032) The latter will say and from his standpoint correctly, that the texts in support of the religious value of the charkha are produced from an outworn civilization.
('36', 234, 1, 13, 467194) He will argue that if a rishi were to write the Vedas today, he will draw his spiritual illustrations from the steam engine or, better still, the electric motor, the wireless and the like and the rishi of the future will think nothing of wireless and even the aeroplanes.
('36', 234, 1, 14, 467466) His spiritual vocabulary will with the etheric doubles and thought waves cutting through space in fractions of time denoted by specially invented words representing perhaps a thousandth part of a second.
('36', 234, 1, 15, 467670) The spiritual value of the charkha can only appeal to those who believe with me that this civilization denoted by all insane rush after destroying the limitations of space imposed upon man by nature are coming to an end, even as possibly mightier civilizations based upon attempts to find happiness in multiplicity of material pursuits and comforts have perished.
('36', 234, 1, 16, 468034) If Lala Shamlal takes the spiritual message of the charkha to the villages, he will not need my authority.
('36', 234, 1, 17, 468141) For, I have derived mine from them.

('36', 234, 5, 21, 468264) DEAR FRIEND,
('36', 234, 6, 22, 468277) I have your letter.
('36', 234, 6, 23, 468297) Of course, I remember you well and your

('36', 235, 1, 2, 468379) hospitality.
('36', 235, 1, 3, 468392) I must, however, confess that I do not at all like your manifesto.
('36', 235, 1, 4, 468459) You have made communalism as the pivot of your appeal and you are looking to the Hindu voters to vote for you not because of your superior ability and other qualifications but solely on the ground of your being a Mussalman.
('36', 235, 1, 5, 468683) I feel that you have struck the wrong note.
('36', 235, 1, 6, 468727) If you had, on the contrary, recited your better qualificat ions, if you claim them, and added the hope that your being a Mussal man will not be regarded as a disqualification by the Hindu voters, from my point of view, your manifesto would have been unexception able.
('36', 235, 1, 7, 468996) As it is on the merits, I am obliged to give you a hostile opinion.
('36', 235, 1, 8, 469064) But in any case, even if your manifesto had been unexceptionable, being an avowed non co operator, I cannot have given you anything whatsoever by way of endorsement for publication.
('36', 235, 1, 9, 469246) Yours sincerely, ALI HASSAN, ESQ.

('36', 235, 4, 14, 469568) The parcel has not yet come forward and the students will have probably to be without their copy even next Saturday.
('36', 235, 4, 15, 469685) I now see that you have sent the parcel by goods [train] and the goods parcels sometimes take even as much as a month.
('36', 235, 4, 16, 469804) When the parcel comes, I shall take care of the extra seven copies.

('36', 236, 4, 8, 470389) What does a charkha cost there?
('36', 236, 4, 9, 470421) From where do you get the wood?
('36', 236, 4, 10, 470453) Is the spindle made locally?
('36', 236, 4, 11, 470482) If yes, what does it cost?
('36', 236, 4, 12, 470509) How many charkhas are plying?
('36', 236, 4, 13, 470539) What is the rate of payment for spinning?
('36', 236, 4, 14, 470581) What is the count of the yarn?
('36', 236, 4, 15, 470612) If you have not introduced the practice of testing the strength of the yarn, you should do so.

('36', 236, 10, 23, 471037) If I had known [about your illness] earlier, I would have taken all measures which would have satisfied me at any rate.
('36', 236, 10, 24, 471157) I believe that we should be able to adjust ourselves to any climate.
('36', 236, 10, 25, 471226) I had assumed that you would be able to do so.
('36', 236, 10, 26, 471273) Now I will see what I can do when you are here again.
('36', 236, 10, 27, 471327) What you write about the spinning wheel is quite correct.

('36', 237, 5, 6, 471699) I have gone through the text books.
('36', 237, 5, 7, 471735) I think I read Madhpudo 1
('36', 237, 6, 8, 471761) with sufficient care.
('36', 237, 6, 9, 471783) I had hoped that I would find myself interested and absorbed while reading these books, but I was not.
('36', 237, 6, 10, 471886) I felt like criticizing all the time.
('36', 237, 6, 11, 471924) When I came to the lesson on Ali, I became serious.
('36', 237, 6, 12, 471976) I felt that it might be a fine piece of writing, but as it is it would certainly not please Muslims.
('36', 237, 6, 13, 472077) I think that many of the lessons require to be reconsidered and revised.
('36', 237, 6, 14, 472150) If you wish, we will discuss this further when we meet.
('36', 237, 6, 15, 472206) My view may possibly be wrong.
('36', 237, 6, 16, 472237) There may be some other point of view from which the very same book may be interesting.
('36', 237, 6, 17, 472325) I can today read with interest the Upanishads which formerly used to send me to sleep.
('36', 237, 6, 18, 472412) The principal writers are all of them experienced men.
('36', 237, 6, 19, 472467) I feel unhappy why, even then, I do not appreciate the lessons.
('36', 237, 6, 20, 472531) All the same, I must say, must not I, what I feel?

('36', 239, 1, 3, 474657) What is the use of shutting our eyes to facts?
('36', 239, 1, 4, 474704) And, if the workers will not respond to you or Deshbhakta Venkatappayya, does it also not follow that they will respond to nobody?
('36', 239, 1, 5, 474835) It seems to me that in the circumstances it will be as well to close the agency.
('36', 239, 1, 6, 474916) But, that does not mean stopping all organized khadi work in Andhra Desh.
('36', 239, 1, 7, 474990) But it does mean recognizing the truth of the situation and bowing to it.
('36', 239, 1, 8, 475064) You will then gather together those few workers, if there are any, who will be absolutely loyal to you and you will develop khadi with their aid.
('36', 239, 1, 9, 475210) Independent organizations will still continue and they may do what they like.
('36', 239, 1, 10, 475288) By being thus truthful and recognizing our limitations, we shall be able some day to overcome them and expand as we ought to.

('36', 239, 7, 18, 475792) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('36', 239, 7, 19, 475825) I think you are taking an unduly pessimistic view about Hindi Prachar work.
('36', 239, 7, 20, 475901) Those who are actually doing the teaching work should continue to perform their duty in full confidence that duty heartily and self sacrificingly performed must bear ample fruit in due course.

('36', 240, 3, 4, 476276) DEAR SATIS BABU, Here is another letter of the type I sent you before.
('36', 240, 3, 5, 476347) Mr. Bharucha has told me all about you.
('36', 240, 3, 6, 476387) He wanted me to send you some money.
('36', 240, 3, 7, 476424) I wish I could do so.
('36', 240, 3, 8, 476446) But it is not possible.
('36', 240, 3, 9, 476470) Mr. Birla has offered to loan Rs. 70,000 for one year certainly without interest and without security to the Association.
('36', 240, 3, 10, 476592) But, I feel that unless we have a reserve in the Association coffers or at least that amount, we must not make use of the loan.
('36', 240, 3, 11, 476720) We considered the matter yesterday in the Council and others also agreed.
('36', 240, 3, 12, 476794) Have you any opinion about this?
('36', 240, 3, 13, 476827) I hope both you and Hemaprabha Devi are doing quite all right.

('36', 240, 10, 19, 477062) MY DEAR REHANA,
('36', 240, 11, 20, 477078) I have now secured both your letter and postcard.
('36', 240, 11, 21, 477128) Both the letter and the postcard I got only yesterday.
('36', 240, 11, 22, 477183) You have addressed the postcard at Ahmedabad.
('36', 240, 11, 23, 477229) So it came redirected from Ahmedabad a day late.
('36', 240, 11, 24, 477278) The letter remained on the office board for some time as unclaimed because of the Urdu writing on the envelope which nobody understood.
('36', 240, 11, 25, 477414) You wrote my name in English but the receiver thought that the Urdu name belonged to someone else in the Ashram.

('36', 241, 1, 2, 477569) only on a searching enquiry that the letter was traced on the office board outside.
('36', 241, 1, 3, 477653) Of course, the moral of it is that every one of us should know both Devnagari and Persian scripts.
('36', 241, 1, 4, 477752) Till then, these mistakes and delays will continue.
('36', 241, 1, 5, 477804) I shall now deal with Sir Henry Lawrence directly and send him the information he requires.
('36', 241, 2, 6, 477896) The battle over China silk has now to be postponed to another day when all of you come again to the Ashram.
('36', 241, 2, 7, 478004) You should understand that I did not have enough of your bhajans when you were here.
('36', 241, 2, 8, 478089) You have, therefore, to come, if for nothing else, for giving me more bhajans.
('36', 241, 2, 9, 478168) You must become better and stronger.
('36', 241, 2, 10, 478205) Mirabai has told me all about your conversation with her.

('36', 242, 2, 3, 479119) THE ASHRAM, Monday, August 30, 1926
('36', 242, 3, 4, 479155) BHAI SHAMBHUSHANKER, I have your letter.
('36', 242, 3, 5, 479196) Your diet should contain some greens.
('36', 242, 3, 6, 479234) You should grow them in your own backyard.
('36', 242, 3, 7, 479277) Pickles are not at all necessary, but may be somewhat useful in summer as a method of preserving greens.
('36', 242, 3, 8, 479382) If they are to be harmless, they should contain no mustard or chillies or oil.
('36', 242, 3, 9, 479461) Vinegar can be used as a preservative in pickles.
('36', 242, 3, 10, 479511) I have not altered the views expressed in my book 1; but, not being able to think of a substitute for milk in our country, I have been forced to include it.
('36', 242, 3, 11, 479668) I have also observed that the oils available here do not suit delicate stomachs, and, therefore, I generally advise people to avoid them.
('36', 242, 3, 12, 479806) Salt is not essential.
('36', 242, 3, 13, 479829) In fact, from the point of view of brahmacharya giving up salt is beneficial.
('36', 242, 3, 14, 479907) As a medicine, it has many uses.
('36', 242, 3, 15, 479940) When I fast I always mix some salt in the water which I drink.
('36', 242, 3, 16, 480003) Whey made from mildly fermented curds is quite all right as a substitute for milk.
('36', 242, 3, 17, 480086) There is no harm in removing all the butter from the whey.
('36', 242, 3, 18, 480145) On the contrary, it helps.
('36', 242, 3, 19, 480172) About the quantity or food no absolute standard can be laid down.
('36', 242, 3, 20, 480238) Everyone should fix his own standard on the basis of his experience.
('36', 242, 3, 21, 480307) Wheat, mill, one green and a lemon—nothing else is required.
('36', 242, 3, 22, 480368) The sugar present in wheat ‘and milk is enough for our purpose.
('36', 242, 3, 23, 480432) I think this covers all your questions.
('36', 242, 3, 24, 480472) Till you have recovered complete strength and get normal motions, live only on milk and grapes or whey and grapes.
('36', 242, 3, 25, 480587) After the fast is ended it is necessary in every case to have an enema to ensure bowel movement.
('36', 242, 3, 26, 480684) If you do not start getting normal motions in two or three days, you should take a little castor oil.

('36', 243, 13, 21, 481708) I have your letter.
('36', 243, 13, 22, 481728) 2 Mr. Birla has now altered his mind and he has written to me saying that he is prepared to advance money without interest for one year on the undertaking of the Association to return the loan on the due date.
('36', 243, 13, 23, 481938) This has placed me in a difficulty because that means that the Association should take such securities as are enforceable and absolutely adequate.
('36', 243, 13, 24, 482085) My own intention, therefore, is
('36', 243, 14, 25, 482117) 1 From the postmark 2 Acknowledging on August 28 Gandhiji’s letter of August 21, Banerji had written that he did not meet Birla in Calcutta but hoped that the latter would agree to advance the loan free of interest, or else they would have to mortgage their stock to the Comilla Union Bank (S. N. 11233).

('36', 244, 1, 2, 482467) not to make use of Mr. Birla’s offer.
('36', 244, 1, 3, 482505) If at the end of the year, you must borrow from the bank to refund his loan, is it worth while going to the trouble of finding securities for one year, if the same ceremony is to be performed at the end of one year?
('36', 244, 1, 4, 482721) After all, you will save only Rs. 1,800/ in one year.
('36', 244, 1, 5, 482775) And my advice, therefore, is not to trouble about this loan and do what you like with the bank.
('36', 244, 1, 6, 482871) But, if you insist upon making use of Mr. Birla’s money, please let me know whose guarantees are to be, and what their status is.

('36', 245, 3, 6, 483889) Everyone can do that in his own home, thus, you can certainly refuse to marry, you need not eat any but the simplest food, you can cultivate the habit of retiring to bed early and getting up early in the morning and beginning the day with thanksgiving to the Almighty.
('36', 245, 3, 7, 484158) You are already treating the untouchables as your very own.

('36', 246, 6, 9, 485098) A GREAT INDUSTRIALIST
('36', 246, 7, 10, 485120) The death of Mr. Ratan Tata removes from our midst a great industrialist.
('36', 246, 7, 11, 485194) Jamshedpur is the greatest Indian enterprise of the greatest Indian firm.
('36', 246, 7, 12, 485268) The late Mr. Ratan Tata was a noted member of the great house of the Tatas.
('36', 246, 7, 13, 485344) I had the honour of coming in close contact with him when he invited me to visit Jamshedpur in connection with some trouble with his employees.
('36', 246, 7, 14, 485488) It was an agreeable surprise to me to find him full of sympathy for his employees and ready to concede everything that could be legitimately urged on their behalf.
('36', 246, 7, 15, 485652) He created in my mind the impression of being a just and generous employer.
('36', 246, 7, 16, 485728) His solicitude for the prosperity of the industry seemed to me to be independent of the added wealth it might bring to the distinguished house.
('36', 246, 7, 17, 485872) I tender my condolences to the members of the deceased’s family.
('36', 246, 8, 18, 485937) WHY OBLIGED?
('36', 246, 9, 19, 485950) A correspondent justifying the weakness of his yarn says:” We are obliged to buy waste cotton in the market at almost the same price as good cotton.” Why obliged?
('36', 246, 9, 20, 486113) Surely, if good cotton is not available at a particular place, it should be procured from places where it is available.
('36', 246, 9, 21, 486233) Bengal, Bihar and Orissa get their good cotton from Wardha.
('36', 246, 9, 22, 486293) Manchester gets its supplies from India, Uganda, Egypt and America.
('36', 246, 9, 23, 486361) Why cannot the correspondent get his from a neighbouring district or province?
('36', 246, 9, 24, 486440) There is no excuse for members of the All India Spinners’ Association to spin bad yarn.
('36', 246, 9, 25, 486528) An English proverb has it that things that are worth doing are worth doing well.
('36', 246, 9, 26, 486609) Love of khadi must not be exhausted with the mere spinning.
('36', 246, 9, 27, 486669) It is but a stepping stone to the mastery of the art and of its economics.
('36', 246, 10, 28, 486744) RECRUITING EVIL A correspondent from Sirsi (Canara) writes:
('36', 246, 11, 29, 486804) 1 This was in reply to the telegram dated September 1, reading:” Reaching about Tuesday wire Harihar Sharma your convenience.”

('36', 247, 1, 2, 486973) An agent of the Assam Tea Planters intends to start a depot to canvass coolies for the plantation.
('36', 247, 1, 3, 487072) He does not want Mussalman coolies for they are not obedient.
('36', 247, 1, 4, 487134) He wants only Hindus who are docile.
('36', 247, 1, 5, 487171) He offers Rs. 15 for every coolie registered.
('36', 247, 1, 6, 487217) Is it not possible to stop the evil?
('36', 247, 1, 7, 487254) There are so many misrepresentations.
('36', 247, 1, 8, 487292) The evil is no doubt great.
('36', 247, 1, 9, 487320) Assam is not a depopulated place.
('36', 247, 1, 10, 487354) There is something wrong if labourers have to be taken all the way from Canara to Assam.
('36', 247, 1, 11, 487443) It is impossible for the simple Canarese villagers to know the conditions in the Assam plantations.
('36', 247, 1, 12, 487543) Freedom of contract is lost as soon as a tout intervenes whose business it is to get labour somehow or other.
('36', 247, 1, 13, 487653) Let all the Canarese go to Assam if they wish and if they are not to displace the Assamese.
('36', 247, 1, 14, 487745) But in the present case, if the facts be as stated by the correspondent, there can be no question of wish on the part of the Canarese and no outsider can go to Assam without displacing an Assamese.
('36', 247, 1, 15, 487943) Tea plantations of Assam must be worked, if they are at all worked, by indigenous labour so long as there are poor people in Assam who are without employment.
('36', 247, 1, 16, 488102) My correspondent asks me to suggest remedies to avert the evil of recruiting.
('36', 247, 1, 17, 488180) Public opinion is the most effective remedy.
('36', 247, 1, 18, 488225) Let the correspondent collect sufficient workers who will make it their business during their spare hours to visit the neighbouring villages and warn the villagers against falling into traps laid for them.
('36', 247, 1, 19, 488431) Someone among these workers should try to study conditions of labour in Assam either by a personal visit or from literature published on the subject.

('36', 248, 1, 2, 489461) 282. NATIONAL SCHOOLS
('36', 248, 2, 3, 489483) A Sholapur correspondent informs me that a translation has appeared in the press of an article 1 I wrote in Navajivan (8th August last).
('36', 248, 2, 4, 489620) It is said to attribute to me the opinion that I know of no school which fulfils the requirements of the definition of national educational institutions given by the Congress at Belgaum.
('36', 248, 2, 5, 489807) He adds that the translation is likely to damage even bona fide national schools if it goes unchallenged.
('36', 248, 2, 6, 489913) I am sorry I have not seen the translation.
('36', 248, 2, 7, 489957) But I know that I have never given the opinion attributed to me.
('36', 248, 2, 8, 490022) On the contrary, I do know some national schools that do fulfil the requirements.
('36', 248, 2, 9, 490104) I give below a translation of the paragraph referred to by the correspondent:
('36', 248, 3, 10, 490182) Therefore where either the parents or the teachers are opposed to the national ideal, the school should certainly be closed.
('36', 248, 3, 11, 490307) Where the parents are fired by national ideals and prove their adhesion by giving adequate donations for the support of national schools, and, where the teachers being themselves believers in the national ideal are ceaselessly striving to enforce it, I can understand a relaxation of the discipline if the scholars are lukewarm about the ideal.
('36', 248, 3, 12, 490652) In such a case, it may be necessary to continue the school.
('36', 248, 3, 13, 490712) For we may hope some day to influence the scholars.
('36', 248, 3, 14, 490764) But at the time of writing these lines, I can think of no such school.
('36', 248, 3, 15, 490835) In my opinion, the last sentence is clear and unequivocal.
('36', 248, 3, 16, 490894) ‘Such school’ manifestly refers to schools that may have believing parents and teachers and lukewarm pupils.
('36', 248, 3, 17, 491003) Even at the moment of writing this note, I can recall no such school.
('36', 248, 3, 18, 491073) But if there is a national school where, in spite of teachers’ efforts and parents’ concrete concurrence, in the shape of donations, the scholars do not carry out the ideal, my advice would be, as it is according to the paragraph quoted, not to close such a school, but to continue it for further effort.
('36', 248, 3, 19, 491378) The same idea is amplified in the succeeding paragraph which therefore will bear translation.
('36', 248, 3, 20, 491472) It is: My own experience is that where the national ideal is found dormant, the fault lies at the door of teachers.
('36', 248, 3, 21, 491588) The instance quoted is that of a school where the teachers are enthusiastic, the pupils indifferent and the parents hostile, Where parents object to their children learning hand spinning and

('36', 249, 1, 2, 491858) weaving 1 khadi, and threaten to withdraw their children if ‘untouchable’ children are admitted, it is inconsistent with his self respect for a teacher to hold on to the institution and persist in conducting it in the teeth of opposition from parents.
('36', 249, 1, 3, 492110) It would be a waste of national time.
('36', 249, 1, 4, 492148) If we conduct national institutions in spite of the opposition of parents interested in them, we should be guilty of the same fault we impute to the missionaries.
('36', 249, 1, 5, 492311) We have no right to give instruction to children against the wish of their parents and thus create family dissensions.
('36', 249, 1, 6, 492430) Those who are over 16 years and who understand their interest, who are capable of suffering hardship, are not in need of protection.
('36', 249, 1, 7, 492563) They are self reliant.
('36', 249, 1, 8, 492586) For such, wherever ne cessary, we should open and undoubtedly conduct educational institutions.
('36', 249, 1, 9, 492682) But, where and how many are such students throughout India?
('36', 249, 1, 10, 492742) Where are the schools in which there are students who can be likened to godly, fearless, long suffering and yet wise and respectful Prahlad?
('36', 249, 1, 11, 492883) When we have numerous scholars of that description, we shall see new life everywhere and no one will want to know where is swaraj.
('36', 249, 1, 12, 493014) And, in order to bring into being such scholars, we need to conduct purest national schools even though there may be only very few scholars in them.
('36', 249, 1, 13, 493163) Where parents become patrons, scholars lord it over the teachers, and where the threat is held out directly or indirectly that if Congress assistance is not rendered the school will go under Government protection, there is no national school and the sooner such a school is closed the better.
('36', 249, 1, 14, 493456) We understand now what non co operation is.
('36', 249, 1, 15, 493500) We are in a position to appraise its value.
('36', 249, 1, 16, 493544) We know its dangers.
('36', 249, 1, 17, 493565) And, therefore, the way of non co operating schools is clear.
('36', 249, 1, 18, 493627) Let us not deceive ourselves.
('36', 249, 1, 19, 493657) Let us remain unmoved by ups and downs and let us who have faith continue our work and all will be well.

('36', 249, 4, 22, 493806) A correspondent pertinently asks whether Sir Ganga Ram’s statistics regarding Hindu widows refer to all Hindu widows or only to those whom custom prohibits from marrying.

('36', 250, 1, 2, 494111) inquiry to Sir Ganga Ram, I learn that his” statistics are not confined to classes in which widow remarriage is prohibited, they contain Hindu widows of all classes”.
('36', 250, 1, 3, 494278) Sir Ganga Ram adds:
('36', 250, 2, 4, 494298) Moreover, it was no good to give figures of such classes only.
('36', 250, 2, 5, 494361) We all know that Mussalmans and Christians can remarry, yet there are widows amongst them who will remarry sooner or later.
('36', 250, 2, 6, 494485) It is the ban on Hindu widows which I wish to remove.
('36', 250, 2, 7, 494539) I don’t want to force every widow to remarry.
('36', 250, 2, 8, 494585) This is no doubt good.
('36', 250, 2, 9, 494608) But the ban in Hinduism is confined only to the classes which come within the prohibited zone.
('36', 250, 2, 10, 494703) Outside the zone Hindu widows marry almost as freely as Mussalman and Christian widows, though to be fair to the latter, it must be mentioned that all Mussalman and Christian widows do not remarry ‘sooner or later’.
('36', 250, 2, 11, 494919) There are many who do not from choice.
('36', 250, 2, 12, 494958) There is no doubt, however, that a tendency exists even outside the prohibited zone to slavishly copy the so called higher classes and to keep young widows unmarried.
('36', 250, 2, 13, 495125) But so long as we have not fuller statistics, it is not possible accurately to gauge the magnitude of the evil wrought by the custom of prohibiting widows from remarrying.
('36', 250, 2, 14, 495297) It is to be hoped that Sir Ganga Ram’s and other associations that have specialized in this matter will collect and publish the required statistics.
('36', 250, 2, 15, 495446) It should be possible to know the number of Hindu widows, say under twenty years, among the prohibited classes.
('36', 250, 2, 16, 495558) Let not my correspondent whose question was prompted probably by a desire to justify the ban and those who think with him disregard the evil of young widows being prohibited from marrying.
('36', 250, 2, 17, 495747) If there be even one child widow, the wrong demands redress.

('36', 250, 5, 20, 495858) Several correspondents have written to me taking me to task for reading the New Testament to the students of the Gujarat National College.
('36', 250, 5, 21, 495997) One of them asks:
('36', 250, 6, 22, 496015) Will you please say why you are reading the Bible to the students of the Gujarat National College?
('36', 250, 6, 23, 496114) Is there nothing useful in our literature?
('36', 250, 6, 24, 496157) Is the Gita less to you than the Bible?
('36', 250, 6, 25, 496197) You are never tired of saying that you are a staunch Sanatani Hindu.
('36', 250, 6, 26, 496266) Have you not now been found out as a Christian in secret?
('36', 250, 6, 27, 496324) You may say a man does not become a Christian by reading the Bible.
('36', 250, 6, 28, 496392) But is not reading the Bible to the boys a way of converting them to Christianity?
('36', 250, 6, 29, 496475) Can the boys remain uninfluenced by the Bible reading?
('36', 250, 6, 30, 496530) Are they not likely to become Christians by reading the Bible?
('36', 250, 6, 31, 496593) What is there specially in the Bible that is not to be found in our sacred books?
('36', 250, 6, 32, 496675) I do hope you will give an adequate
('36', 251, 0, 1, 496711) 252 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 251, 1, 2, 496753) reply and give preference to the Vedas over the Bible.
('36', 251, 2, 3, 496808) I am afraid I cannot comply with the last request of my correspondent.
('36', 251, 2, 4, 496879) I must give preference to that which the boys lawfully want over what I or others may desire.
('36', 251, 2, 5, 496973) When they invited me to give them an hour per week, I gave them the choice between reading the Gita, Tulsidas’s Ramayana, and answering questions.
('36', 251, 2, 6, 497120) By a majority of votes, they decided to have the New Testament and questions and answers.
('36', 251, 2, 7, 497210) In my opinion, the boys were entitled to make that choice.
('36', 251, 2, 8, 497269) They have every right to read the Bible or to have it read to them.
('36', 251, 2, 9, 497337) I offered to read the Gita or the Ramayana as I am reading both at the Ashram to the inmates and as therefore the reading of either at the National College would have involved the least strain and the least preparation.
('36', 251, 2, 10, 497557) But the boys of the College probably thought they could read the other books through others but they would have from me my interpretation of the New Testament as they knew that I had made a fair study of it.
('36', 251, 3, 11, 497765) I hold that it is the duty of every cultured man or woman to read sympathetically the scriptures of the world.
('36', 251, 3, 12, 497876) If we are to respect others religions as we would have them to respect our own, a friendly study of the world’s religions is a sacred duty.
('36', 251, 3, 13, 498016) We need not dread, upon our grown up children, the influence of scriptures other than our own.
('36', 251, 3, 14, 498111) We liberalize their outlook upon life by encouraging them to study freely all that is clean.
('36', 251, 3, 15, 498204) Fear there would be when someone reads his own scriptures to young people with the intention secretly or openly of converting them.
('36', 251, 3, 16, 498336) He must then be biased in favour of his own scriptures.
('36', 251, 3, 17, 498392) For myself, I regard my study of and reverence for the Bible, the Koran, and the other scriptures to be wholly consistent with my claim to be a staunch sanatani Hindu.
('36', 251, 3, 18, 498560) He is no sanatani Hindu who is narrow, bigotted, and considers evil to be good if it has the sanction of antiquity and is to be found supported in any Sanskrit book.
('36', 251, 3, 19, 498726) I claim to be a staunch sanatani Hindu because, though I reject all that offends my moral sense, I find the Hindu scriptures to satisfy the needs of the soul.
('36', 251, 3, 20, 498885) My respectful study of other religions has not abated my reverence for or my faith in the Hindu scriptures.
('36', 251, 3, 21, 498993) They have indeed left their deep mark upon my understanding of the Hindu scriptures.
('36', 251, 3, 22, 499078) They have broadened my view of life.
('36', 251, 3, 23, 499115) They have enabled me to understand more clearly many an obscure passage in the Hindu scriptures.
('36', 251, 3, 24, 499212) The charge of being a Christian in secret is not new.
('36', 251, 3, 25, 499266) It is both a libel and a compliment—a libel because there are men who can believe me to be capable of being secretly anything, i.e., for fear of
('36', 252, 0, 1, 499411) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 253
('36', 252, 1, 2, 499456) being that openly.
('36', 252, 1, 3, 499475) There is nothing in the world that would keep me from professing Christianity or any other faith the moment I felt the truth of and the need for it.
('36', 252, 1, 4, 499624) Where there is fear there is no religion.
('36', 252, 1, 5, 499666) The charge is a compliment in that it is a reluctant acknowledgment of my capacity for appreciating the beauties of Christianity.
('36', 252, 1, 6, 499796) Let me own this.
('36', 252, 1, 7, 499813) If I could call myself, say, a Christian, or a Mussalman, with my own interpretation of the Bible or the Koran, I should not hesitate to call myself either.
('36', 252, 1, 8, 499970) For then Hindu, Christian and Mussalman would be synonymous terms.
('36', 252, 1, 9, 500037) I do believe that in the other world there are neither Hindus, nor Christians, nor Mussalmans.
('36', 252, 1, 10, 500132) There all are judged not according to their labels or professions but according to their actions irrespective of their professions.
('36', 252, 1, 11, 500264) During our earthly existence there will always be these labels.
('36', 252, 1, 12, 500328) I therefore prefer to retain the label of my forefathers so long as it does not cramp my growth and does not debar me from assimilating all that is good anywhere else.
('36', 252, 1, 13, 500496) The hypersensitiveness that my correspondents have betrayed is but an indication of the intensity of the wave of intoleration that is swooping through this unhappy land.

('36', 253, 1, 2, 501551) literature I have felt compelled to glance through and the copious correspondence my review of M. Bureau’s book has given rise to demand a public discussion of a question which is of paramount interest to society.
('36', 253, 1, 3, 501765) A Malabar correspondent writes:
('36', 253, 2, 4, 501797) In your review of Monsieur Bureau’s book it is stated that there is no case on record of celibacy or long abstention producing any evil effects on us.
('36', 253, 2, 5, 501948) In my own case, however, three weeks seem to be the utmost limit of beneficial abstention.
('36', 253, 2, 6, 502039) At the end of that period I usually feel a heaviness of body, a restlessness both of body and mind, leading to bad temper.
('36', 253, 2, 7, 502162) Relief is obtained either by normal coitus or nature herself coming to the rescue by an involuntary discharge.
('36', 253, 2, 8, 502273) Far from feeling weak or nervous, I become the next morning calm and light and am able to proceed to my work with added gusto.
('36', 253, 3, 9, 502400) A friend of mine, however, developed distinctly injurious symptoms by abstention.
('36', 253, 3, 10, 502482) He is about 32 years of age, a strict vegetarian and a very religious person.
('36', 253, 3, 11, 502560) He is absolutely free from any vicious habits of body or mind.
('36', 253, 3, 12, 502623) Yet he was having till two years ago, when he married, copious discharges at night followed by weakness of body and depression of spirits.
('36', 253, 3, 13, 502762) Lately he developed excruciating pain in the abdominal region.
('36', 253, 3, 14, 502825) On the advice of an Ayurvedic doctor he married and is now cured.
('36', 253, 4, 15, 502891) I am intellectually convinced of the superiority of celibacy on which all our ancient Shastras agree.
('36', 253, 4, 16, 502993) But the experiences I have quoted above make it clear that we are not able to absorb in our system the highly vital secretion of the testes which consequently becomes a toxic product.
('36', 253, 4, 17, 503177) I humbly request you, therefore, to publish, for the benefit of people like me who have no doubt as to the importance of chastity and abstention, in Young India, any device, such as the asanas of Hatha Yoga, which will enable us to assimilate and absorb the
('36', 253, 5, 18, 503435) vital product in our system.
('36', 253, 5, 19, 503464) The instances quoted by the correspondent are typical.
('36', 253, 5, 20, 503519) In several such cases I have observed hasty generalizations from insufficient data.
('36', 253, 5, 21, 503603) Ability to retain and assimilate the vital fluid is a matter of long training.
('36', 253, 5, 22, 503682) It must be so, as it gives a strength to body and mind such as no other process does with equal effect.
('36', 253, 5, 23, 503786) Drugs and mechanical contrivances may keep the body in a tolerable condition but they sap the mind and make it too weak to resist the play of a multitude of passions which like so many deadly foes surround every human being.
('36', 253, 5, 24, 504011) Too often do we expect results in spite of practices which are calculated to retard, if not to defeat, them.
('36', 253, 5, 25, 504120) The common mode of life is shaped to minister to our passions.
('36', 253, 5, 26, 504183) Our food, our literature, our

('36', 254, 1, 3, 504353) The vast majority of us want to marry, to have children and generally to enjoy ourselves, be it ever so moderately.
('36', 254, 1, 4, 504469) It will be so more or less to the end of time.
('36', 254, 1, 5, 504516) But there are, as there always have been, exceptions to the general rule.
('36', 254, 1, 6, 504590) Men have wanted to live a life wholly dedicated to the service of humanity which is the same thing as saying ‘to God’.
('36', 254, 1, 7, 504709) They will not divide their time between the rearing of a special family and the tending of the general human family.
('36', 254, 1, 8, 504826) Necessarily, such men and women cannot afford to live the general life which is designed to promote the special, individual interest.
('36', 254, 1, 9, 504960) Those who will be celibates for the sake of God need to renounce the laxities of life and find their enjoyment in its austere rigours.
('36', 254, 1, 10, 505095) They may be ‘in the world’ but not ‘of it’.
('36', 254, 1, 11, 505139) Their food, their business, their hours of business, their recreations, their literature, their outlook upon life must, therefore, be different from the general.
('36', 254, 1, 12, 505301) It is now time to inquire whether the correspondent and his friend desired to live the life of complete abstention and whether they modelled it accordingly.
('36', 254, 1, 13, 505458) If not, it is not difficult tounderstand the relief that the relaxation brought in the first case and the weakness that supervened in the second case.
('36', 254, 1, 14, 505609) Marriage no doubt was the remedy in that second case, as in the vast majority of cases marriage is the most natural and desirable state when one finds oneself even against one’s will living the married life in one’s daily thought.
('36', 254, 1, 15, 505840) The potency of thought unsuppressed but unembodied is far greater than that of thought embodied, that is, translated into action.
('36', 254, 1, 16, 505970) And, when the action is brought under due control, it reacts upon and regulates the thought itself.
('36', 254, 1, 17, 506070) Thought thus translated into action becomes a prisoner and is brought under subjection.
('36', 254, 1, 18, 506158) Thus considered, marriage too is a mode of restraint.
('36', 254, 1, 19, 506212) I must not undertake in the course of a newspaper article to give detailed instructions for the guidance of those who desire to live a life of ordered restraint.
('36', 254, 1, 20, 506374) I must refer them to my Guide to Health 1 written years ago with that end in view.
('36', 254, 1, 21, 506457) It does need revision in certain parts in the light of fresh experiences, but there is nothing in the book which I would withdraw.
('36', 254, 1, 22, 506588) General directions, however, may be safely reiterated here:
('36', 254, 2, 23, 506648) 1 This was based on a series of articles published in 1913 under the title”General Knowledge about Health”.
('36', 255, 0, 1, 506756) 256 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 255, 1, 2, 506798) Eat moderately always leaving the dining room with a feeling of pleasant hunger.
('36', 255, 1, 3, 506879) 2. Highly spiced and fatty vegetarian foods must be avoided.
('36', 255, 1, 4, 506940) Separate fat is wholly unnecessary when an adequate supply of milk is available.
('36', 255, 1, 5, 507021) Little food suffices when there is little vital waste.
('36', 255, 1, 6, 507076) 3. Both the body and the mind must be constantly occupied in clean pursuits.
('36', 255, 1, 7, 507153) 4. Early to bed and early to rise is a necessity.
('36', 255, 1, 8, 507203) 5. Above all a life of restraint presupposes an intense living desire for reunion with God.
('36', 255, 1, 9, 507295) When there is heart perception of this central fact, there will be continuously increasing reliance upon God to keep His instrument pure and in order.
('36', 255, 1, 10, 507446) The Gita says:”Passions return again and again in spite of fasting but even the desire ceases when the Divine is seen.” 1 This is literally true.
('36', 255, 1, 11, 507592) The correspondent refers to asana and pranayama 2. I believe that they have an important place in the practice of restraint.
('36', 255, 1, 12, 507717) But my own experiences in this direction, I am sorry to say, are not worth recording.
('36', 255, 1, 13, 507803) There is, to my knowledge, little literature on the subject that is based on present experience.
('36', 255, 1, 14, 507900) But it is a field worthy of exploration.
('36', 255, 1, 15, 507941) I would, however, warn the inexperienced reader from trying it or accepting the directions of the next Hatha Yogi he may meet with.
('36', 255, 1, 16, 508073) Let him be sure that an abstemious and godly life is wholly sufficient to achieve the much to be desired restraint.

('36', 255, 5, 20, 508265) BHAISHRI PRABHUDAS, I have your letter.
('36', 255, 5, 21, 508305) You may rest assured that I do not belittle pranayama.
('36', 255, 5, 22, 508360) But what can be achieved through pranayama can also be achieved through other means and, therefore, I do not look upon it as indispensable.
('36', 255, 5, 23, 508500) While pranayama is extremely difficult to master, other means can be easily cultivated by all men, and I think it is more beneficial to employ them particularly in this age.
('36', 255, 5, 24, 508674) Pranayama may help in observing celibacy, but I am afraid that by itself it does not

('36', 256, 1, 3, 508907) This is the main point.
('36', 256, 1, 4, 508931) You yourself have been practising pranayama.
('36', 256, 1, 5, 508976) When you have achieved good success in it, come and discuss the matter with me again.
('36', 256, 1, 6, 509062) I should certainly like to know persons who have succeeded in the practice of pranayama.
('36', 256, 1, 7, 509151) Kakasaheb Kalelkar, who is an inmate of the Ashram but who lives elsewhere at present because of his illness, has had good practice in pranayama.
('36', 256, 1, 8, 509297) After he has recovered his health, please do correspond with him or see him when you are here.
('36', 256, 1, 9, 509392) He will be back here, most probably by the time of Diwali.
('36', 256, 1, 10, 509451) I do not give his address, since it is essential that his correspondence should be severely restricted at present.
('36', 256, 1, 11, 509566) Then there is Vinoba who lives in Wardha.
('36', 256, 1, 12, 509608) His address is: Satyagraha Ashram, Wardha.
('36', 256, 1, 13, 509651) You may certainly write to him.

('36', 256, 10, 23, 509914) DEAR FRIEND,
('36', 256, 11, 24, 509927) I have your letter.
('36', 256, 11, 25, 509947) 1 I suppose by conquest of sleep you mean its regulation and not complete giving up of sleep.
('36', 256, 11, 26, 510041) For myself, I take and need at least six hours’ sleep during 24 hours.
('36', 256, 11, 27, 510112) It is true that I take my sleep very lightly.
('36', 256, 11, 28, 510158) But, if I do not take this minimum quantity, both body and mind suffer.
('36', 256, 11, 29, 510230) Complete eradication of sex desire I hold to be a possibility and an advantage.
('36', 256, 11, 30, 510310) Complete cessation of sleep I do not
('36', 256, 12, 31, 510347) 1 Swami Raghavananda in his letter of July 24 (S.N. 10782) had stated that he was familiar with Gandhiji’s ideas on ‘self conquest’ and ‘conquest of the sense of taste and sex desire’, but that he wanted to know Gandhiji’s views on ‘conquest of sleep’, having heard that he was a ‘spare sleeper’ and one who could, on waking at will, attend to worship or to writing.

('36', 257, 5, 7, 511034) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, September 3, 1926
('36', 257, 6, 8, 511075) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your latest letter 1. You may certainly share all my letters with any friend you like subject to the proviso that they do not find their way to the Press.
('36', 257, 6, 9, 511259) Not that I mind it, but it can do no good whatsoever and may possibly do harm to the cause both you and I are trying to serve.
('36', 257, 6, 10, 511386) I do not share your fear that the Mussalmans will fight any just solution.
('36', 257, 6, 11, 511461) It will, however, very largely depend upon Hindu prudence, Hindu moderation and absolute fairplay.
('36', 257, 6, 12, 511560) Why do you say that Islam and democracy are incompatible?
('36', 257, 6, 13, 511618) On the contrary, were not the early Califs among the most democratic sovereigns the world has ever seen?
('36', 257, 6, 14, 511723) But a clash of arms will not move me.
('36', 257, 6, 15, 511761) Any real movement for freedom is like new birth and all its attendant travail.
('36', 257, 6, 16, 511840) If we have to go through a purgatory, we must face it for the priceless boon.
('36', 257, 6, 17, 511918) As a matter of fact, that clash is now taking place on a miniature scale and it may be found to be sufficient for teaching wisdom to both the parties.
('36', 257, 6, 18, 512069) Already innocent blood has been spilt by the gallon.
('36', 257, 6, 19, 512122) By preference in education, I mean every backward section should be specially encouraged by special grants of scholarships.
('36', 257, 6, 20, 512246) It would be the inevitable duty of the state, if it is to represent all classes, to begin with the weakest.
('36', 257, 6, 21, 512354) To spend freely upon the real education of

('36', 258, 0, 1, 512449) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 259
('36', 258, 1, 2, 512494) the backward classes will be ultimately to provide the safest cure for discontent.
('36', 258, 1, 3, 512577) I know that the present discontent on the part of either side comes from consciousness of weakness.
('36', 258, 1, 4, 512677) Hindus feel their weakness in physical strength and endurance.
('36', 258, 1, 5, 512740) Mussalmans feel their weakness in education and earthly possessions.
('36', 258, 1, 6, 512809) So, I look upon the present feud between the two as a healthy sign in a way.
('36', 258, 1, 7, 512886) It is really unconsciously a battle for freedom.
('36', 258, 1, 8, 512935) It was possible for them to have avoided this if they could have assimilated the programme of 1920. But the energy and the national consciousness that were called into being in 1920 could not possibly remain dormant and, as they could not find their way in a healthy channel, they have taken the unhealthy course of internecine bloody feud.
('36', 258, 1, 9, 513276) I have not a shadow of doubt that, at the end of it, we shall feel stronger and purer because there are people who do not want this feud, who believe in non violence as the final rock and who have not lost their heads during the turmoil.
('36', 258, 1, 10, 513514) The fear expressed by you in your final paragraph is certainly not groundless.
('36', 258, 1, 11, 513593) But is it any wonder our administrative limb has atrophied?
('36', 258, 1, 12, 513653) Many mount the clerical posts—they are nothing more—through flattery and the like.
('36', 258, 1, 13, 513736) It would be therefore no wonder to me if, in the beginning stages of the experiment, we choose wrong men to represent us.
('36', 258, 1, 14, 513858) In that case, history would be merely repeating itself.
('36', 258, 1, 15, 513914) But even that should not frighten a reformer, You cannot wrap yourself in cotton wool and fight freedom’s battle.
('36', 258, 1, 16, 514028) Nor need the spectre of the I.C.S. men refusing to work frighten one.
('36', 258, 1, 17, 514098) But, in spite of my strong indictment of the I.C.S. men, I have sufficient faith in their good nature as men having the upper hand when the demora lizing artificial prestige and protection these estimable men enjoy have been removed.
('36', 258, 2, 18, 514332) Always at your service,

('36', 259, 3, 4, 514690) DEVDAS, I have your letter.
('36', 259, 3, 5, 514718) The description of”sparrow” is very good.
('36', 259, 3, 6, 514760) I would let him know nothing about the things you mention.
('36', 259, 3, 7, 514819) You have, however, put me on my guard and so there need be no fear.
('36', 259, 3, 8, 514887) He has the weakness which you mention, but it will soon pass.
('36', 259, 3, 9, 514949) His virtues are enduring.
('36', 259, 3, 10, 514975) He is full of compassion and good natured beyond measure.
('36', 259, 3, 11, 515033) Intolerance is a form of pride.
('36', 259, 3, 12, 515065) But these weaknesses seem trivial beside his virtues.
('36', 259, 3, 13, 515119) Since he is under your charge, I do not worry.
('36', 259, 3, 14, 515166) I am sure you have seen his letter to me.
('36', 259, 3, 15, 515208) It is beautiful.
('36', 259, 3, 16, 515225) I remember to have written one letter to the Maharaja of Nabha.
('36', 259, 3, 17, 515289) But now I will reply to his letter, and will send you a copy of the reply.
('36', 259, 3, 18, 515364) The parcel containing spindles, etc., was dispatched to you on August 9. It was registered.
('36', 259, 3, 19, 515456) It is strange that you have not received it.
('36', 259, 3, 20, 515501) I have asked them to make inquiries at this end.
('36', 259, 3, 21, 515550) Please inquire there, too.
('36', 259, 3, 22, 515577) I am not losing weight at such a rate.
('36', 259, 3, 23, 515616) It stands at about 99. I believe I am in very good health.
('36', 259, 3, 24, 515675) There must be many rulers worse than the Maharaja of Nabha.
('36', 259, 3, 25, 515735) I believe that there are some.
('36', 259, 3, 26, 515766) To be sure his oppression was not a little.
('36', 259, 3, 27, 515810) I believe, however, that the Government did not depose him for his faults though.
('36', 259, 3, 28, 515892) I also believe that it would not have been able to do so if he had been free from them.
('36', 259, 3, 29, 515980) I have nothing else against him; only, I cannot support and help him in his agitation.

('36', 261, 3, 6, 517812) In this age, it does not have even as much value as a simple piece of thread.
('36', 261, 3, 7, 517890) Moreover, my present state of mind is such that, till Sudras and Antyajas are permitted to wear it, I cannot but feel aversion to it.
('36', 261, 3, 8, 518024) But, then, why should we thoughtlessly and without reason burden the Sudras and the Antyajas with the responsibility of wearing it?
('36', 261, 3, 9, 518156) I do not see any good coming out of a public discussion of this subject at present.
('36', 261, 3, 10, 518240) But we will think more about it when you are here.
('36', 261, 3, 11, 518291) I cannot say that your health has become really fine now.
('36', 261, 3, 12, 518349) Personally, I don’t see much difference between Sonegarh and Ahmedabad.
('36', 261, 3, 13, 518421) About this, too, we will think together when you are here.
('36', 261, 3, 14, 518480) Very much more than medicine, I believe that climate and finding out by experiment the right kind of diet help.
('36', 261, 3, 15, 518592) All of us were about to be drowned in the river today.
('36', 261, 3, 16, 518647) We had a rehearsal too.
('36', 261, 3, 17, 518671) But now only the comedy of it remains.
('36', 261, 3, 18, 518710) How this happened is a long story, but someone or other is bound to write to you and tell it.

('36', 262, 3, 5, 519402) In a case like yours God alone can help.
('36', 262, 3, 6, 519443) Whether we believe in Him or not does not much matter as ignorance of law does not save us from its sanctions.
('36', 262, 3, 7, 519554) God is the supremest law.
('36', 262, 3, 8, 519580) I suggest to you that the purpose of our being is to know ourselves.
('36', 262, 3, 9, 519649) The way to know oneself lies through service of all that lives.
('36', 262, 3, 10, 519713) And we cannot serve humanity without sacrificing ourselves.
('36', 262, 3, 11, 519773) Self sacrifice is therefore the highest law for us.

('36', 262, 9, 22, 520248) You must have read what I wrote about the Bible in Young India.
('36', 262, 9, 23, 520312) 2 I think it should satisfy you.
('36', 262, 9, 24, 520345) I have also glanced through what has appeared in Vishwamitra.

('36', 263, 1, 3, 520649) Learning it through me, they can learn but one thing, the quintessence of all religions, namely, Ramanama.
('36', 263, 1, 4, 520756) If others made improper use of my writings or activities, that can do no harm either to me or to my principles.
('36', 263, 1, 5, 520868) How can truth be misused?
('36', 263, 1, 6, 520894) Any attempt to do so will have only the opposite effect.
('36', 263, 1, 7, 520951) That is why truth is given the highest place in the Upanishads and other scriptures and has been described as God.

('36', 263, 10, 19, 521626) If there was any possibility of some useful purpose being served by my going there, I would not in the least hesitate to accept your invitation, for I would look upon the arrival of a deputation 3 from South Africa as an unusual event and would not

('36', 264, 1, 2, 522246) regard my going to Bombay as a violation of my vow.
('36', 264, 1, 3, 522298) I doubt, however, the propriety of my attending your function.
('36', 264, 1, 4, 522361) The gentlemen who are arriving are shrewd men and of an independent temper.
('36', 264, 1, 5, 522437) There can be no serious discussion of the South Africa problem at a reception 1. The reception may possibly have some tangible effect on them, but from that point of view my presence at the function, I think, can serve no purpose at all.
('36', 264, 1, 6, 522675) It is likely that they wish to see me.
('36', 264, 1, 7, 522714) I will certainly find out whether they do.
('36', 264, 1, 8, 522757) I know their leader 2 well, and therefore everything which should be done by me will be done.
('36', 264, 1, 9, 522851) I don’t think my going there will serve any particular purpose.
('36', 264, 1, 10, 522915) I have come to this conclusion after an objective consideration of the matter.
('36', 264, 1, 11, 522994) If, however, you or Sir Purushottamdas 3 have some special reason to consider my presence essential, I will certainly come.
('36', 264, 1, 12, 523118) My talk with Sir Henry Lawrence 4 did not relate to the deputation; it was about the commission on agriculture.

('36', 264, 7, 19, 523510) Sheth Lalji Naranji also wrote to me directly, and I have replied 5 to him saying that my going to Bombay is likely to serve no useful purpose.

('36', 265, 1, 3, 524057) If they wish to see me, I will arrange a meeting at any convenient place.
('36', 265, 1, 4, 524131) I have, however, left the responsibility for the final decision to Lalji Sheth and Purushottamdas.
('36', 265, 1, 5, 524230) If they think that I must go, I will go.
('36', 265, 1, 6, 524271) It is advisable that no decision should be taken in a hurry.
('36', 265, 1, 7, 524332) Jamnadas had been feeling uneasy for the past many months, but I used to reassure him and persuade him to carry on.
('36', 265, 1, 8, 524448) In the end, when I took no notice of his letters, he took prompt steps to carry out his decision.
('36', 265, 1, 9, 524546) I sent for him, and he has been here.
('36', 265, 1, 10, 524584) He gave three reasons for leaving: (1) Self assumed unworthiness as teacher; (2) Throat trouble, which makes it difficult for him to speak; (3) Lack of faith in spinning as yajna, though he unreservedly believes in khadi.
('36', 265, 1, 11, 524806) The last two reasons appear sufficient to me for letting him go.
('36', 265, 1, 12, 524871) If he experiences difficulty in speaking, he certainly cannot teach; and if he does not appreciate the value of spinning in the spirit of service, he can have no influence on the pupils.
('36', 265, 1, 13, 525058) I have now written to Nanabhai and asked him so visit Rajkot and inspect the school there— he is the head of this Dakshinamurti 1 and Vice Chancellor of the Vidyapith.
('36', 265, 1, 14, 525226) You need not resign from the Committee in a hurry.
('36', 265, 1, 15, 525277) I will write more about this after discussing the matter with Nanabhai.
('36', 265, 1, 16, 525349) The more I see of Ratilal 2 the more I notice his straightforward nature and his simplicity.
('36', 265, 1, 17, 525442) I have observed that it is Champa 3 who is extravagant.
('36', 265, 1, 18, 525498) Just now they have both gone to Manilal Kothari’s.
('36', 265, 1, 19, 525549) Champa wishes to stay on there till the Paryushana 4 holidays.
('36', 265, 1, 20, 525612) Ratilal has not yet decided what he will do.
('36', 265, 1, 21, 525657) I am writing to Doctor 5 about Jeki 6. I will write to you again after I have his reply.

('36', 268, 10, 20, 529692) 1 S. G. Vaze 2 The letter to Sheth Lalji Naranji, referred to in this letter, was written on September 7, 1926. 3 Secretary of the Indian Merchants’ Chamber, Bombay.
('36', 268, 10, 21, 529858) He had an interview with Gandhiji on August 17, 1926 in connection with the report of the Royal Commission on Indian Currency.
('36', 268, 10, 22, 529985) 4 The report of the Commission was published in August 1926; an agitation was organized against its recommendation to fix the value of the rupee at 1s.
('36', 268, 10, 23, 530137) 5 Asked in an interview by the Associated Press at Ahmedabad on September 8, what was his reply to the open letter of Dr. Mahmud and others inviting him to resume public life and call a representative conference, Gandhiji referred to this article as his answer.
('36', 268, 10, 24, 530399) The gist of it, according to the Associated Press report, was”that he was unable to respond to the appeal in the manner suggested by the signatories”.

('36', 269, 0, 1, 530579) 270 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 269, 1, 2, 530621) The signatories are mistaken in thinking that I have gone into retirement.
('36', 269, 1, 3, 530696) I have imposed upon myself a year’s abstention from all avoidable public engagements.
('36', 269, 1, 4, 530782) The year is fast drawing to a close.
('36', 269, 1, 5, 530819) The reasons for abstention were fully stated at the time.
('36', 269, 1, 6, 530877) My health and the requirements of the Ashram necessitated restfrom toilsome travelling and taxing public engagements.
('36', 269, 1, 7, 530995) If I have not interfered in the Council matters, it is because I have, perhaps, no aptitude for them—certainly, I have no faith in the Councils giving us swaraj.
('36', 269, 1, 8, 531157) I have ceased to meddle in Hindu Muslim quarrels because my meddling at this juncture, I am convinced, can only do harm.
('36', 269, 1, 9, 531278) Then there remain untouchability, national educational institutions and the spinning wheel.
('36', 269, 1, 10, 531370) To these I am giving all the attention I am capable of giving.
('36', 269, 2, 11, 531433) Therefore, I venture to suggest to the friends that what to them appears to be my inaction is really concentrated action.
('36', 269, 3, 12, 531555) I do not in the least share their pessimism.
('36', 269, 3, 13, 531600) The Hindu Muslim quarrels are in a way, unknown to us, a fight for swaraj.
('36', 269, 3, 14, 531675) Each party is conscious of its impending coming.
('36', 269, 3, 15, 531724) Each wants to be found ready and fit for swaraj when it comes.
('36', 269, 3, 16, 531787) Hindus think that they are physically weaker than the Mussalmans.
('36', 269, 3, 17, 531853) The latter consider them selves to be weak in educational and earthly equipment.
('36', 269, 3, 18, 531934) They are now doing what all weak bodies have done hitherto.
('36', 269, 3, 19, 531994) This fighting therefore, however unfortunate it may be, is a sign of growth.
('36', 269, 3, 20, 532071) It is like the Wars of the Roses.
('36', 269, 3, 21, 532105) Out of it will rise a mighty nation.
('36', 269, 3, 22, 532142) A better than the bloody way was opened out to us in 1920, but we could not assimilate it.
('36', 269, 3, 23, 532233) But even a bloody way is better than utter helplessness and unmanliness.
('36', 269, 4, 24, 532306) Even the ugly duel between Motilalji and Lalaji is part of the same struggle.
('36', 269, 4, 25, 532384) Let the enemies of India’s freedom gloat over their differences.
('36', 269, 4, 26, 532449) These patriots will be working under the same flag long before the gloating is over.
('36', 269, 4, 27, 532534) They are both lovers of their country.
('36', 269, 4, 28, 532573) Lalaji sees no escape from communalism.
('36', 269, 4, 29, 532613) Panditji cannot brook even the thought of it.
('36', 269, 4, 30, 532659) Who shall say that only one is right?
('36', 269, 4, 31, 532697) Both attitudes are a response to the prevailing atmosphere.
('36', 269, 4, 32, 532757) Lalaji who was born to public life with swaraj on his lips is no hater of it now.
('36', 269, 4, 33, 532839) He proposes to mount to it through communalism which he considers to be an inevitable stage in our evolution.
('36', 269, 4, 34, 532949) Panditji thinks that communalism blocks the way and he therefore proposes to ignore it even as auto suggestionists ignore disease seeing that health, not ‘illth’, is the law of life.
('36', 269, 4, 35, 533132) The nation can ill afford to do without Sir Abdur Rahim as
('36', 270, 0, 1, 533191) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 271
('36', 270, 1, 2, 533236) without Hakim Saheb Ajmal Khan.
('36', 270, 1, 3, 533268) Sir Abdur Rahim, who wrote the weighty minute with Gokhale on the Islington Commission, is no enemy of his country.
('36', 270, 1, 4, 533384) Who shall blame him if he thinks that the country cannot progress without the Mussalmans competing with the Hindus on equal terms?
('36', 270, 1, 5, 533515) He may be wrong in his methods.
('36', 270, 1, 6, 533547) But he is none the less a lover of freedom.
('36', 270, 1, 7, 533591) Whilst, therefore, I can make room in my mind for all these various schools of thought, for me there is only one way.
('36', 270, 1, 8, 533709) I have no faith in communalism even as a stage, or perhaps, better still, I have no fitness for work on that stage.
('36', 270, 1, 9, 533825) I must, therefore, hold myself in reserve till the storm is over and the work of rebuilding has commenced.
('36', 270, 1, 10, 533932) I can but watch from a safe distance the struggle that goes on in the Councils.
('36', 270, 1, 11, 534012) I honour those who have faith in them for prosecuting the programme with zeal.
('36', 270, 1, 12, 534091) It is educated India which is split up into parties.
('36', 270, 1, 13, 534144) I confess my incompetence to bring these parties together.
('36', 270, 1, 14, 534203) Their method is not my method.
('36', 270, 1, 15, 534234) I am trying to work from bottom upward.
('36', 270, 1, 16, 534274) To an onlooker, it is exasperatingly slow work.
('36', 270, 1, 17, 534322) They are working from top downward—a process more difficult and complicated than the former.
('36', 270, 1, 18, 534415) The millions for whom the signatories have claimed to write are uninterested in the party complications which are above their heads.
('36', 270, 1, 19, 534548) For them there is only the spinning wheel.
('36', 270, 1, 20, 534591) To paraphrase a celebrated proverb the wheels of God spin slowly but most effectively.
('36', 270, 1, 21, 534678) I am engaged in attending to these tiny wheels of God.
('36', 270, 1, 22, 534733) Let the signatories and the others who care note that they are ceaselessly moving.
('36', 270, 1, 23, 534816) Their efficiency is daily and visibly growing.
('36', 270, 1, 24, 534863) And when the storm is blown over, the parties are united, Hindus, Mussalmans, Brahmins, non Brahmins, the suppressors and the suppressed have joined hands, they will find that the country has been prepared by silent hands for effecting not a punitive and violent boycott,.
('36', 270, 1, 25, 535136) but a health giving, non violent, constructive boycott of foreign cloth.
('36', 270, 1, 26, 535209) The nation must exhibit some universal strength and power, be they ever so little.
('36', 270, 1, 27, 535292) That is this boycott of foreign cloth.
('36', 270, 1, 28, 535331) The signatories regard themselves as my followers.
('36', 270, 1, 29, 535382) I invite them to follow the lead of the charkha.
('36', 270, 1, 30, 535431) I have not ceased to lead that little, simple wheel which daily hums to me the distress of the masses.
('36', 270, 1, 31, 535534) For better or for worse, I have staked my all on the charkha, for it represents to me Daridranarayana, God of and in the poor and in the downtrodden.

('36', 271, 4, 7, 535895) After listening to speeches by several speakers, she went to her mother and said:”Look, mother, what nonsense these mad folk are talking!
('36', 271, 4, 8, 536033) I only wish to listen to the sweet music of my charkha.
('36', 271, 4, 9, 536089) I don’t want this madness.” Listening to the speeches of our orators and reading what our newspapermen write, my plight is like this girl’s.

('36', 271, 10, 14, 536442) DEAR SISTER, I have your letter.
('36', 271, 10, 15, 536475) The parcel will follow.
('36', 271, 10, 16, 536499) You have sent quite a good quantity of grape juice.

('36', 271, 10, 18, 536598) He must have got the parcel which you sent, for he says in his letter that he has received another parcel from you.
('36', 271, 10, 19, 536714) I have been able to sell 72 pieces out of the stock with me.
('36', 271, 10, 20, 536775) I have kept the articles to show them to people and have made no special effort to sell them.
('36', 271, 10, 21, 536869) As you seem to be hard up for cash, I send a draft for Rs. 300; the sum is against the whole stock and does not represent the exact amount of the proceeds from the articles sold.
('36', 271, 10, 22, 537048) If the costlier material lying with me cannot be sold, I will return it to you and ask you to send me material for the same amount which can be sold.
('36', 271, 10, 23, 537198) I will not ask you to return its price.
('36', 271, 10, 24, 537238) I will include the frocks in the list of the stock when they are received.

('36', 272, 4, 9, 537889) I have no right at all to say that what you say is wrong.
('36', 272, 4, 10, 537947) But, as your well wisher, I should like to caution you.
('36', 272, 4, 11, 538003) Two kinds of powers are working in every one of us—one visible and the other invisible.
('36', 272, 4, 12, 538091) The latter is far stronger.
('36', 272, 4, 13, 538119) It may be a holy power, but it can also be an evil power.
('36', 272, 4, 14, 538177) Govardhanbhai 1 has graphically represented in Sarasvatichandra the working of these powers.
('36', 272, 4, 15, 538270) The visible power working in Kumud 2 kept her attached to Pramaddhan 3 and the invisible power drew her to Sarasvatichandra 4. All reverence to that person, the invisible power in whom is a holy power and controls the visible power.
('36', 272, 4, 16, 538503) Who can see anything to blame in either of you if the two powers work in such harmony in you both?
('36', 272, 4, 17, 538602) The only proper wish for a human being to cherish for the succeeding life is that one should merge into God.
('36', 272, 4, 18, 538711) If that wish is fulfilled, one will be united with one’s father, mother, brother, sister and all other dear ones.

('36', 273, 3, 5, 539437) I understand your dilemma.
('36', 273, 3, 6, 539464) It had all along been my desire to see that there was no excess of anything.
('36', 273, 3, 7, 539541) Even excess of hesitation may sometimes appear as a sign of incivility.
('36', 273, 3, 8, 539613) Now that you have adopted a particular manner, I don’t see any need for you to change it.
('36', 273, 3, 9, 539703) If you try, that may even give a shock to Mathuradas 2. You should, therefore, go on as at present.

('36', 273, 6, 19, 540284) I do not wish to make a will to oblige people, after my death, to have my body carried in a cart, for I see a sort of egotism in the idea.
('36', 273, 6, 20, 540423) Moreover, if they cremate my body on the Ashram premises, I would rather that they carried it on a few bamboo poles on shoulders or with hands.
('36', 273, 6, 21, 540567) I don’t feel that it is a matter of dharma to insist on dead bodies being carried in carts.
('36', 273, 6, 22, 540659) I fully accept, however, the necessity and propriety of carrying them in that manner in certain circumstances.

('36', 274, 8, 18, 541861) One who knows what she is writing about says:
('36', 274, 9, 19, 541907) Until our boys learn to conserve their vital forces India will never have the men she should have.
('36', 274, 9, 20, 542006) For nearly 17 years I have had charge of boys’ schools in India.
('36', 274, 9, 21, 542071) It is appalling to see the number of boys—Hindu, Mahommedan and Christian—who begin school life full of energy and enthusiasm and hope and end in physical wrecks.
('36', 274, 9, 22, 542234) In literally hundreds of cases, I have traced this directly to self abuse, sodomy or early marriage.
('36', 274, 9, 23, 542335) I have today the names of 42 boys guilty of sodomy and not a boy is over 13 years of age.
('36', 274, 9, 24, 542425) Masters and house fathers will deny that the conditions exist but if the right tactics are used the trouble will be discovered and nearly always the boys will confess.
('36', 274, 9, 25, 542593) A large per cent of the boys confess to having been taught by men—often their own relatives.
('36', 274, 9, 26, 542686) This is no fanciful picture.

('36', 275, 1, 3, 542832) I have known it before.
('36', 275, 1, 4, 542856) It was first brought to my notice by a Delhi schoolmaster now nearly eight years ago.
('36', 275, 1, 5, 542942) But I have kept silent, merely discussing with individuals the remedies.
('36', 275, 1, 6, 543015) The mischief is not confined to India.
('36', 275, 1, 7, 543054) But it comes upon India with deadlier effect because of the curse of child marriage.
('36', 275, 1, 8, 543139) A public discussion of this very difficult and delicate subject has become necessary, because one sees in respectable newspapers the sexual passion discussed with a freedom that would not have been possible a few years back.
('36', 275, 1, 9, 543364) The fashion of regarding the sexual act as natural, necessary, moral and conducive to mental and physical health has accentuated the evil.
('36', 275, 1, 10, 543503) The advocacy by the cultured men of the free use of contraceptives has created an atmosphere favouring the growth of the sexual microbe.
('36', 275, 1, 11, 543640) The tender and receptive minds of youngsters draw the hasty deductions favouring and justifying their unlawful and destructive desires and the parents and the teachers exhibit a sad, almost criminal, indifference and tolerance in respect of the deadly vice.
('36', 275, 1, 12, 543898) Short of complete purification of the social environment, nothing, in my opinion, will stop the evil.
('36', 275, 1, 13, 544000) The unconscious and subtle effect of an atmosphere charged with sexuality cannot but react upon the minds of the school going youth of the country.
('36', 275, 1, 14, 544148) The surroun dings of the city life, the literature, the drama, the cinema, the household appointments, various social ceremonies do but to point one thing the promotion of the sexual passion.
('36', 275, 1, 15, 544340) It is impossible for little children already conscious of the beast within to resist the pressure exerted by these influences.
('36', 275, 1, 16, 544467) Palliatives will not answer.
('36', 275, 1, 17, 544496) The reformation must begin with the elders if they would discharge their trust by the younger generation.

('36', 275, 4, 20, 544656) I have received many letters, both in English and vernacular, asking me to publish this series of articles in pamphlet form in all the three languages—English, Hindi and Gujarati.
('36', 275, 4, 21, 544836) I am aware that a dozen letters may only represent the individual writers and there may be no real demand for the pamphlets.
('36', 275, 4, 22, 544961) These are not propitious times for venturing on new publications.
('36', 275, 4, 23, 545027) But a friend has come to the rescue and guaranteed all loss.

('36', 276, 3, 7, 545537) CONGRESS PRESIDENTSHIP
('36', 276, 4, 8, 545560) Shrinivas Iyengar’s election as President of the forthcoming Congress was a foregone conclusion.
('36', 276, 4, 9, 545657) The Congress Committees were bound to elect an avowed Swarajist.
('36', 276, 4, 10, 545722) If Sjt.
('36', 276, 4, 11, 545730) Shrinivas Iyengar is a fighter, he is also an idealist.
('36', 276, 4, 12, 545786) He is impatient and his impatient zeal often takes him into waters too deep for ordinary men.
('36', 276, 4, 13, 545880) He plunges without giving a second thought.
('36', 276, 4, 14, 545924) He comes upon the responsible office at a time of unexampled difficulty.
('36', 276, 4, 15, 545997) But Sjt.
('36', 276, 4, 16, 546006) Iyengar has faith in himself and his cause.
('36', 276, 4, 17, 546050) Gods have been known to help those who believe in themselves.
('36', 276, 4, 18, 546112) Let us hope that they will not prove false in this case.
('36', 276, 4, 19, 546169) Iyengar will need all the help that Congressmen can give him.
('36', 276, 4, 20, 546231) We have learnt the art of giving passive loyalty.
('36', 276, 4, 21, 546281) But time has come when we must learn to give active loyalty.
('36', 276, 4, 22, 546342) Difficult as his task is, it would be quite easy if Congressmen will carry out policies and resolutions to which they themselves become party.
('36', 276, 4, 23, 546485) This is the least that is expected of members of any organization that is to make any progress.
('36', 276, 4, 24, 546581) I tender Sjt.
('36', 276, 4, 25, 546595) Iyengar my congratulations for the high honour that has been conferred upon him, and I tender my sympathy for the extraordinary difficulties that face him and pray that God will give him the strength and wisdom to overcome them.
('36', 276, 5, 26, 546824) WORTHY OF EXAMPLE
('36', 276, 6, 27, 546842) Haribhau Phatak sending to the Secretary, All India Spinners’ Association, yarn contributions says:
('36', 276, 7, 28, 546942) I am sending today Shrimati Annapurnabai Gore’s yarn 25,000 yds.
('36', 276, 7, 29, 547007) In Maharashtra many women undertake observances during the monsoon season.
('36', 276, 7, 30, 547082) Annapurnabai has vowed to spin and present 1,00,000 yards of yarn during the season.
('36', 276, 7, 31, 547167) The accompanying is the first month’s contribution.
('36', 276, 7, 32, 547219) My friend Shridharpant Shastri is her husband and both are members of the A.I.S.A. They have already sent their full quota.
('36', 276, 7, 33, 547343) They are a busy family.
('36', 276, 7, 34, 547367) They have children
('36', 277, 0, 1, 547386) 278 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 277, 1, 2, 547428) and they are poor.
('36', 277, 1, 3, 547447) With all that they have bad eyes.
('36', 277, 1, 4, 547481) This effort therefore on their part is well worth noting.
('36', 277, 1, 5, 547539) And so the effort undoubtedly is.
('36', 277, 1, 6, 547573) It is not possible without love of one’s kind; and it is love of the poor, love of God, love of ‘the country’ that is behind the charkha movement.
('36', 277, 2, 7, 547720) THE DOUBLE DISTILLED POISON
('36', 277, 3, 8, 547748) The curse of untouchability has permeated even the ‘untouchables’.
('36', 277, 3, 9, 547815) And so we have grades of untouchability amongst them, the higher grade refusing contact with the lower.
('36', 277, 3, 10, 547919) A Thiyya friend writes from Calicut:
('36', 277, 4, 11, 547956) We Thiyyas, a supposed low caste people, but in education and social status much improved, and almost equal to any other community in Malabar, have a temple here in Calicut.
('36', 277, 4, 12, 548130) A meeting was arranged to consider the question of giving entry to our Panchama brothers on the birthday of our great Guru, Sri
('36', 277, 5, 13, 548258) Sri Narayana Guru.
('36', 277, 5, 14, 548277) This was opposed by a large majority and there was much hooliganism to give trouble to the supporters.
('36', 277, 5, 15, 548380) We voted for the entry of the Panchama brethren, but we were in a minority.
('36', 277, 5, 16, 548456) We have therefore boycotted
('36', 277, 6, 17, 548484) the temple and we go and worship at another temple where no such distinction is observed.
('36', 277, 6, 18, 548574) We are determined to fight this battle to a finish.
('36', 277, 6, 19, 548626) I tender my congratulations to the small band of reformers.
('36', 277, 6, 20, 548686) It was a right thing for them to refuse to use a privilege that was denied to the Panchamas.
('36', 277, 6, 21, 548779) Those who claim justice must come with clean hands.
('36', 277, 6, 22, 548831) The Thiyyas may not set up against others a barrier which they would break down when erected against themselves.
('36', 277, 6, 23, 548944) That was the lesson Vykom taught.
('36', 277, 6, 24, 548978) It must on no account be forgotten.
('36', 277, 6, 25, 549014) Let the reformers then pursue their battle, in the true satyagraha spirit, without anger and with quiet determination, and they will soon turn the minority into a majority.
('36', 277, 6, 26, 549187) Time and tide are with them.
('36', 277, 7, 27, 549216) A TISSUE OF MISREPRESENTATIONS
('36', 277, 8, 28, 549247) If most newspapers in the world were to cease publication, the world will not lose anything.
('36', 277, 8, 29, 549340) Probably, it will heave a sigh of relief.
('36', 277, 8, 30, 549382) The newspapers generally give not facts but fiction.
('36', 277, 8, 31, 549435) This reflection arises from my having read a so called interview with me published in the Messenger of America.
('36', 277, 8, 32, 549547) It is the official organ of the American Philosophical Society.
('36', 277, 8, 33, 549611) Why even a philosophical society’s organ should give currency to fiction in the name of fact is more than I can understand.
('36', 277, 8, 34, 549735) I should not have noticed this ‘interview’ but for the distortion
('36', 278, 0, 1, 549801) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 279
('36', 278, 1, 2, 549846) it contains about my views of Theosophy.
('36', 278, 1, 3, 549887) I must, therefore pass by the fiction that”I was spinning on an old fashioned loom,” or that”there were mango trees outside my room,” or the worse fiction that”it is through sympathy and unders tanding of America and the other great nations that we Indians gain the moral force to make our sacrifices.” I must hasten to the Theosophical fictions.
('36', 278, 1, 4, 550234) Among other things I am reported to have said is that”I am not in sympathy with the Theosophical Movement”, that”I am still a Theosophist but I am not in sympathy with the movement.” This is just the opposite of what I could have said.
('36', 278, 1, 5, 550470) For I am not and have never been a member of any Theosophical Society, but I am and have ever been in sympathy with its message of universal brotherhood and consequent toleration.
('36', 278, 1, 6, 550650) I owe much to Theosophical friends of whom I have many.
('36', 278, 1, 7, 550706) Whatever critics may say against Madame Blavatsky or Col.
('36', 278, 1, 8, 550764) Olcott or Dr. Besant, their contribution to humanity will always rank high.
('36', 278, 1, 9, 550840) What has been a bar to my joining the society, as the interview somewhat correctly puts, is its secret side—its occultism.
('36', 278, 1, 10, 550963) It has never appealed to me.
('36', 278, 1, 11, 550992) I long to belong to the masses.
('36', 278, 1, 12, 551024) Any secrecy hinders the real spirit of democracy.
('36', 278, 1, 13, 551074) But I recognize that there are two sides at least to every question.
('36', 278, 1, 14, 551143) And there may be much to be said in favour of occultism in religion.
('36', 278, 1, 15, 551212) Hinduism is certainly not free from it.
('36', 278, 1, 16, 551252) But I am not called upon to subscribe to it.
('36', 278, 1, 17, 551297) I repeat the request I have often made to interviewers that, if they must interview me or report anything about me, they will do me a favour and serve truth if they will submit to me for correction and verification all they wish to report as having been said by me.

('36', 278, 3, 19, 551585) 318. DEFENDING CHILD MARRIAGE
('36', 278, 4, 20, 551615) A reader of Young India writes:
('36', 278, 5, 21, 551647) I am very much pained to read the following sentence in your article,”Curse of Child Marriage”, published in the Young India of the 26th
('36', 278, 6, 22, 551784) August 1926:”Only a man innocent of self restraint and steeped in vice could call it a sin not to marry a girl before she reached the age of monthly periods.”
('36', 278, 7, 23, 551943) I fail to understand why you could not take a charitable view of those whose opinion differs from you.
('36', 278, 7, 24, 552046) One can certainly say that the Hindu law giver was entirely wrong in prescribing child marriage.
('36', 278, 7, 25, 552143) But I think it
('36', 279, 0, 1, 552158) 280 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 279, 1, 2, 552200) improper to say that those who insist on child marriage are”steeped in vice”.
('36', 279, 1, 3, 552278) It seems to go beyond the limits of politeness in controversy.
('36', 279, 1, 4, 552341) In fact this is the first time that I heard such an argument against child marriage.
('36', 279, 1, 5, 552426) Neither the Hindu social reformers nor the Christian missionaries ever said so, so far as I am aware.
('36', 279, 1, 6, 552528) Imagine therefore the shock which I received when I found this argument in the writing of Mahatma Gandhi whom I believed to be perfection itself, so far at least as charity towards opponents is concerned.
('36', 279, 1, 7, 552733) You have condemned not one or two but probably every one of the Hindu law givers.
('36', 279, 1, 8, 552815) For, so far as I know, every smritikara enjoins early
('36', 279, 2, 9, 552869) marriage of girls.
('36', 279, 2, 10, 552888) It is impossible to hold as you have suggested that the passages enjoining early marriage are interpolations.
('36', 279, 2, 11, 552998) The practice of early marriage is not confined to any province or class of society, but is practically a universal custom in India.
('36', 279, 2, 12, 553130) It is also a very old practice dating from the time of the Ramayana.
('36', 279, 3, 13, 553199) I shall try to give briefly what I consider might have been the reasons why the Hindu law givers insisted upon early marriage of girls.
('36', 279, 3, 14, 553335) They considered it very desirable that every girl should have a husband as a rule.
('36', 279, 3, 15, 553418) This is necessary no less for the peace of mind and happiness of the girls themselves than for the welfare of society in general.
('36', 279, 3, 16, 553548) If every girl has to be provided with a husband, the choice of husband should be made by the parents of the girl and not by the girls themselves.
('36', 279, 3, 17, 553694) If the choice is left to the girls themselves, it will result in many girls not being married at all, not because they do not like marriage, but because it is very difficult for all girls to find out suitable husbands.
('36', 279, 3, 18, 553913) It is also dangerous, for it might lead to flirtation and might cause looseness of morals.
('36', 279, 3, 19, 554004) Youths who appear to be good might ruin the virtue of simple girls.
('36', 279, 3, 20, 554072) Again, if the choice is to be made by parents, the girls must be married young.
('36', 279, 3, 21, 554152) When they are grown up, they may fall in love and may not like to marry the bridegroom selected by the parents.
('36', 279, 3, 22, 554264) When a girl is married young, she becomes one with her husband and his family.
('36', 279, 3, 23, 554343) The union is more natural and more perfect.
('36', 279, 3, 24, 554387) It is sometimes difficult for grown up girls with fixed ideas and habits to adapt themselves in a new home.
('36', 279, 3, 25, 554495) The chief objection to early marriage is that it weakens the health of the girl and her children.
('36', 279, 3, 26, 554593) But this objection is not very convincing for the following reasons.
('36', 279, 3, 27, 554662) The age of marriage is now rising among the Hindus, but the race is becoming weaker.
('36', 279, 3, 28, 554747) Fifty or a hundred years ago the men and women were generally stronger, healthier and more long lived than now.
('36', 279, 3, 29, 554859) But early marriage was then more in vogue.
('36', 279, 3, 30, 554902) The physique of educated girls who are married late is not generally better than the girls who receive less education and are married early.
('36', 279, 3, 31, 555043) From these facts it appears probable that early marriage does not cause as much physical deterioration as some people believe.
('36', 280, 0, 1, 555170) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 281
('36', 280, 1, 2, 555215) You have good knowledge of both European society and Indian society.
('36', 280, 1, 3, 555284) You will be able to say whether on the whole Indian wives are more devoted to their husbands than European wives; whether among the poor people the Indian husbands treat their wives more kindly than European husbands; whether there are fewer cases of unhappy marriages among Indians than among Europeans; whether sexual morality is higher in Indian society than in European society.
('36', 280, 1, 4, 555667) If in these respects Indian marriages are more successful than European marriages, then early marriage which is an essential feature of Indian marriages should not be condemned.
('36', 280, 2, 5, 555845) I cannot believe that the Hindu law givers were actuated by any consideration except the true welfare of society in general (including both men and women) in laying down the injunction of early marriage of girls.
('36', 280, 2, 6, 556058) I believe that early marriage of girls is one of the features of Hindu society which have maintained its purity and prevented its disruption in spite of very hostile environments.
('36', 280, 2, 7, 556238) You may not believe all this.
('36', 280, 2, 8, 556268) But may we not expect that you should discard your idea that all the great Hindu law givers who have insisted on early marriage of girls were innocent of self restraint and were”steeped in vice”?
('36', 280, 3, 9, 556464) The Madras case reported by you seems to be very peculiar.
('36', 280, 3, 10, 556523) The jury held that the girl committed suicide.
('36', 280, 3, 11, 556570) But the girl said that her husband set fire to her clothes.
('36', 280, 3, 12, 556630) In these conflicting circumstances, it is very difficult to hold that the facts which you consider to be indisputable are really so.
('36', 280, 3, 13, 556763) There have been millions of cases of girl wives below 13. Not one case of suicide due to cruel advances of the husband has been heard before.
('36', 280, 3, 14, 556905) Probably there were peculiar features in the Madras case and early marriage was not the principal cause of the death.
('36', 280, 3, 15, 557023) Well does the poet say:”It costs very little to fashion a suitable philosophy in order to mitigate the rudeness of facts that secretly hurt one’s conscience.” This reader of Young India has gone a step further.
('36', 280, 3, 16, 557234) He has not only fashioned a suitable philosophy but ignored facts and erected his argument on unsupported statements.
('36', 280, 3, 17, 557352) The charge of want of charity I must pass by, if only because I have not accused the law givers, but I have ventured to impute vice to those who could insist on marriage at an age too tender for bearing the burden of motherhood.
('36', 280, 3, 18, 557581) Want of charity comes into being only when you accuse a live person not an imaginary being, and that too without cause—of impure motives.
('36', 280, 3, 19, 557719) But is there any warrant for the writer saying that the original authors of the several smritis who preached self restraint wrote the verses enjoining marriage of little
('36', 281, 0, 1, 557889) 282 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 281, 1, 2, 557931) Is it not more charitable to assume that the rishis could not be guilty of impurity or gross ignorance of cardinal facts concerning the growth of the human body?
('36', 281, 1, 3, 558093) But even if the texts ordering child, as opposed to early (for early marriage means marriage well before 25), marriage be found to be authoritative, we must reject them in the light of positive experience and scientific knowledge.
('36', 281, 1, 4, 558324) I question the accuracy of the statement that child marriage is universal in Hindu society.
('36', 281, 1, 5, 558416) I should be sorry to find that ‘millions of girls’ are married, i.e., live as wives whilst they are yet children.
('36', 281, 1, 6, 558530) The Hindus would have died as a race long ago, if ‘millions of girls’ had their marriages consummated at, say, the age of eleven.
('36', 281, 1, 7, 558660) Nor does it follow that, if the parents are to continue to make the choice of husbands for their daughters, the marriage must be contracted and consummated early.
('36', 281, 1, 8, 558823) It is still less true to maintain that if girls have to make their choice, there must be courtship and flirtation.
('36', 281, 1, 9, 558938) After all, courtship is not universal in Europe and thousands of Hindu girls are married after fifteen and yet have their husbands selected by their parents.
('36', 281, 1, 10, 559096) Mussalman parents invariably select husbands for their grown up daughters.
('36', 281, 1, 11, 559171) Whether the choice is to be made by girls or their parents is a separate question and is regulated by custom.
('36', 281, 1, 12, 559281) The correspondent has tendered no proof to support the statement that children of grown up wives are weaker than those of child wives.
('36', 281, 1, 13, 559416) In spite of my experience of both Indian and European society, I must refuse to enter into a comparison of their morals.
('36', 281, 1, 14, 559537) Granting, however, for the sake of argument that morals of European society are lower than those of Hindu society, will it naturally follow that the lowness is due to the marriages taking place after full maturity?
('36', 281, 1, 15, 559752) Lastly, the Madras case does not help the correspondent, but his use of it betrays his hasty judgment based upon a total disregard of facts.

('36', 281, 1, 17, 559999) My conclusion is unaffected by the cause of death.
('36', 281, 1, 18, 560050) It was proved (1) that the girl was of tender age; (2) that she had no sexual desire; (3) that the ‘husband’ made cruel advances; (4) that she is no more.
('36', 281, 1, 19, 560205) It was bad enough if the girl committed suicide, it was worse if the husband murdered her because she could not yield to his inhuman lust.
('36', 281, 1, 20, 560344) The girl was fit only to learn and play, not to play the wife and carry on her tiny shoulders the weight of household cares or the yoke of a lord and master.

('36', 282, 1, 3, 560611) The nation expects better things from those of her sons and daughters who have received a liberal education and who are expected to think and act in her behalf.
('36', 282, 1, 4, 560772) We have many abuses in our midst—moral, social, economic and political.
('36', 282, 1, 5, 560844) They require patient study, diligent research, delicate handling, accuracy of statement and clear thinking on them, and sober, impartial judgment.
('36', 282, 1, 6, 560991) We may then differ, if necessary, as poles asunder.
('36', 282, 1, 7, 561043) But we shall surely harm the country, our respective religions and the national cause, if we do not toil to discover the truth and adhere to it, cost what it may.

('36', 282, 3, 9, 561228) 319. DIGNITY OF LABOUR
('36', 282, 4, 10, 561251) We meet every day young men, graduates of our universities, hawking their degrees.
('36', 282, 4, 11, 561334) They ask for the recommendation of a man who has no education but commands wealth, and in nine cases out of ten, the rich man’s recommendation carries greater weight with the officials than the university degree.
('36', 282, 4, 12, 561547) What does this prove?
('36', 282, 4, 13, 561569) It proves that money is valued more than intellectual culture.
('36', 282, 4, 14, 561632) Brain is at a high discount.
('36', 282, 4, 15, 561661) Why is this so?
('36', 282, 4, 16, 561677) Because brain has failed to earn money.
('36', 282, 4, 17, 561717) This failure is due to want of occupation in which intellectual equipment is in demand.
('36', 282, 4, 18, 561805) Brain which is the most valuable and most powerful force in human society is a waste product for want of a market.
('36', 282, 4, 19, 561920) The peasant’s assets are his hands.
('36', 282, 4, 20, 561956) The zamindar’s assets are his lands.
('36', 282, 4, 21, 561993) Culture of land is agriculture.
('36', 282, 4, 22, 562025) Culture of hand is industry.
('36', 282, 4, 23, 562054) I am aware that agriculture has been called an industry, but differentiation on the basis of their essentials should not place agriculture in the category of industries.
('36', 282, 4, 24, 562224) A branch of manual labour which affords facilities for a progressive culture of the hand securing higher wages at successive stages should be properly called industry.
('36', 282, 4, 25, 562392) This is not the case with the hand working on land.
('36', 282, 4, 26, 562444) The man who drives a plough, sows seeds or weeds the fields will not earn higher wages by the culture of the hand.
('36', 282, 4, 27, 562559) There is no scope for attainment of a more remunerative skill in the agriculturist’s occupation.
('36', 282, 4, 28, 562656) Now take the case of a carpenter; he begins by making packing cases.
('36', 282, 4, 29, 562725) By culture he may learn to make a tantalus.
('36', 282, 4, 30, 562769) Mark the progress in the manual skill resulting in a corresponding rise in the daily wages of the man.
('36', 282, 4, 31, 562872) Let me assure you that the man who made the tantalus with two snakes with their expanded hoods guarding the bottles was first taken into my service for making packing cases.
('36', 282, 4, 32, 563046) His initial wages were 6 annas a day and in two years’ time he was earning one rupee a day and the market value of his handi work left at least 4 annas a day to his employer.
('36', 282, 4, 33, 563221) This gives a rise in
('36', 283, 0, 1, 563242) 284 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 283, 1, 2, 563284) wages from Rs. 133 to 365 in two years.
('36', 283, 1, 3, 563324) .Over 98 per cent of the population work on land.
('36', 283, 1, 4, 563374) Land does not grow in area.
('36', 283, 1, 5, 563402) Hands grow in number with the growth of the population.
('36', 283, 1, 6, 563458) A holding which sustained a family of 5 members 30 years back now has to support 12 to 15 members.
('36', 283, 1, 7, 563557) In some cases this extra pressure is relieved by emigration but in most cases a low standard of vitality is accepted as inevitable.
('36', 283, 1, 8, 563689) The foregoing is an extract from Sjt.
('36', 283, 1, 9, 563727) M. S. Das’s speech delivered to the Bihar Young Men’s Institute in 1924. I have kept that speech by me so as to be able to deal with the essential part of it on a suitable occasion.
('36', 283, 1, 10, 563909) There is nothing new in what the speaker has said.
('36', 283, 1, 11, 563960) But the value of his remarks is derived from the fact that, though a lawyer of distinction, he has not only not despised labour with the hands, but actually learnt handicrafts at a late period in life, not merely as a hobby, but for the sake of teaching young men dignity of labour, and showing that without their turning their attention to the industries of the country the outlook for India is poor.
('36', 283, 1, 12, 564362) Das has himself been instrumental in establishing a tannery at Cuttack which has been a centre of training for many a young man who was before a mere unskilled labourer.
('36', 283, 1, 13, 564532) But the greatest industry which requires the intelligence of millions of hands is no doubt hand spinning.
('36', 283, 1, 14, 564638) What is needed is to give the vast agricultural population of this country an added and an intelligent occupation which will train both their brains and hands.
('36', 283, 1, 15, 564798) It is the finest and cheapest education that can be devised for them.
('36', 283, 1, 16, 564868) Cheapest because it is immediately remunerative.
('36', 283, 1, 17, 564917) And if we want universal education in India, the primary education consists not in a knowledge of the three R’s but in a knowledge of hand spinning and all it implies.
('36', 283, 1, 18, 565085) And when through it the hand and the eye are properly trained, the boy or the girl is ready to receive instruction in the three R’s.
('36', 283, 1, 19, 565218) This I know would appear to some to be utterly absurd and to others to be totally unworkable.
('36', 283, 1, 20, 565312) But those who so think do not know the condition of the millions.
('36', 283, 1, 21, 565378) Nor do they know what it means to educate the millions of children of Indian peasantry.
('36', 283, 1, 22, 565466) And this much needed education cannot be given unless educated India which is responsible for the political awakening in the country will appreciate the dignity of labour and unless every young man would consider it his imperative duty to learn the art of hand spinning and then re introduce it in the village.

('36', 284, 1, 2, 565844) 320. OUT OF THE FRYING PAN
('36', 284, 2, 3, 565871) The report on the condition of returned emigrants stranded in Calcutta submitted to the Council of the Imperial Indian Citizenship Association makes painful reading.
('36', 284, 2, 4, 566037) It appears that there are over 2,000 returned emigrants in Calcutta living in squalid surroundings.
('36', 284, 2, 5, 566137) They are from Fiji, Trinidad, Surinam and British Guiana.”The desire to visit their motherland and the rumour that India had obtained self government were the two chief reasons which led them to leave their birth place.” But they find that their own people in their villages will not have them and so they want to go back to the place where they have come from.” ‘Anywhere out of India’ is their cry”.
('36', 284, 2, 6, 566539) Meantime they are eking out a miserable existence in Calcutta.”They all looked famished.
('36', 284, 2, 7, 566628) Their lot is the lowest ebb of human misery.” The Act that the majority of these men are Colonial born aggravates their misery.
('36', 284, 2, 8, 566756) The reader will not appreciate the full meaning of being ‘Colonial born’.
('36', 284, 2, 9, 566830) These men are neither Indian nor Colonial.
('36', 284, 2, 10, 566873) They have no Indian culture in the foreign lands they go to, save what they pick up from their uncultured half dis Indianized parents.
('36', 284, 2, 11, 567008) They are not Colonial in that they are debarred access to the Colonial, i.e., Western, culture.
('36', 284, 2, 12, 567104) They are therefore out of the frying pan into fire.
('36', 284, 2, 13, 567156) There at least they had some money and a kind of a home.
('36', 284, 2, 14, 567213) Here they are social lepers, not even knowing the language of the people.
('36', 284, 3, 15, 567287) Therefore, the report suggests that it is the clear duty of the Government to send them back to the most suitable Colony that would receive them.
('36', 284, 3, 16, 567433) The tropical Colonies must be glad to have them in preference to raw recruits who have to be initiated.
('36', 284, 3, 17, 567537) The duty is clearly the Government’s.
('36', 284, 3, 18, 567575) For they alone can carry on negotiations with the various Colonies.
('36', 284, 3, 19, 567643) This duty should have been discharged long ago.
('36', 284, 3, 20, 567691) The Imperial Citizenship Association has made the following appeal to the Government:
('36', 284, 4, 21, 567777) With reference to returned Indian emigrants from Fiji, British Guiana, Trinidad and other Colonies now stranded in Calcutta, the Council of the Imperial Indian Citizenship Association, through a representative specially sent from here for the purpose, has made investigations on the spot, and in the light of those investigations, I have the honour to submit the following recommendations for the immediate consideration of the Government of India: l.
('36', 284, 4, 22, 568229) The Government of Fiji should be requested to extend the duration of the moratorium for free passages to freed indentured labourers from 1930 to 1935.
('36', 285, 0, 1, 568380) 286 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 285, 1, 2, 568422) 2. The returned Indian emigrants from British Guiana of whom there are several hundreds now in Calcutta and elsewhere and who are anxious to go back should be included in the Government of India’s scheme of emigration of 500 families to British Guiana.
('36', 285, 1, 3, 568675) 3. The Government of India should, without further delay, establish Emigrants’ Depots in Bombay, Calcutta and Madras.
('36', 285, 1, 4, 568793) These Depots should be organized on the basis of the Indian Emigrants, Friendly Society which was established in Calcutta in 1921 and was dissolved in 1923. This Society looked after the interests of emigrants in every way and was managed by a local committee of both officials and non officials and was very largely financed by the Government of India.
('36', 285, 1, 5, 569147) In view of the fact that another boat with several hundreds of emigrants is expected in Calcutta next month, my Council hopes that the Government of India will realize the gravity of the situation and act in a manner which will not only relieve the distress now prevalent but also effectively prevent further congestion and suffering.
('36', 285, 1, 6, 569482) For the time being, it will be enough if the stranded men get the relief asked for.
('36', 285, 1, 7, 569566) But the innocent looking appeal raises broad and fundamental questions which must not be discussed in this brief notice of the special circumstances brought to light by the report.
('36', 285, 1, 8, 569747) They must not be allowed to confuse the one clear issue which awaits immediate treatment.
('36', 285, 1, 9, 569837) The broad questions however are: l.
('36', 285, 1, 10, 569873) The whole of the emigration policy.
('36', 285, 1, 11, 569909) 2. The special case of British Guiana and Fiji.
('36', 285, 1, 12, 569957) 3. The scope of the friendly societies referred to in the appeal.
('36', 285, 1, 13, 570023) 4. The duty of the nation by the outgoing and returning emigrants.
('36', 285, 1, 14, 570090) The consideration of these questions requires a more favourable occasion and a more thorough treatment than can be given them at the present moment.

('36', 289, 7, 12, 575047) I would have felt happier still if you had been able to serve the cause of Indian music, though of course one should feel happy if anyone teaches even a Western art which helps his or her spiritual development.
('36', 289, 7, 13, 575258) This is so in your case.
('36', 289, 7, 14, 575283) I wish you success in your venture, such as will be worthy of the reputation which you enjoy.
('36', 289, 7, 15, 575377) That is the least you deserve.

('36', 290, 9, 19, 576393) I do not know what to say now or how to comfort you.
('36', 290, 9, 20, 576446) I can only pray for your peace.
('36', 290, 9, 21, 576478) Do not on any account damage your health by putting an undue strain upon your body or nerves.
('36', 290, 9, 22, 576572) Why should Anil be getting fever every day?
('36', 290, 9, 23, 576616) Why should you not be quite all right?
('36', 290, 9, 24, 576655) It was a matter of grief to me that Hemaprabha Devi could not find the Ashram atmosphere congenial to her spirit.
('36', 290, 9, 25, 576769) If only she could have stayed here with the children, it would have been much better and you would have been freer.
('36', 290, 9, 26, 576885) I know that she can look after you as no one else can.

('36', 291, 6, 9, 577293) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, September 10, 1926
('36', 291, 7, 10, 577335) DEAR MAHARAJA SAHEB,
('36', 291, 8, 11, 577356) I have a copy of your letter 1 written to me on the 20th September last year together with your letter to my son.
('36', 291, 8, 12, 577470) I quite re collect having received your letter.
('36', 291, 8, 13, 577518) My impression is that I told Maulana Mahomed Ali that it would be impossible for the Congress to take any effective steps in your case.
('36', 291, 8, 14, 577654) And having done so, it is likely that I wrote nothing to you.
('36', 291, 8, 15, 577716) But, if I did not, it was not due to want of attention or courtesy.
('36', 291, 8, 16, 577784) Hardly a letter comes to me which remains unacknowledged.
('36', 291, 8, 17, 577842) Distance lends enchantment to the scene.
('36', 291, 8, 18, 577883) But let me assure you that a President of the Congress is not ‘uncrowned’ king of India.
('36', 291, 8, 19, 577972) He wields no power.
('36', 291, 8, 20, 577992) He has no strength such as you imagine.
('36', 291, 8, 21, 578032) I know I had none.
('36', 291, 8, 22, 578051) If I had thought that it was possible for me to render any help whatsoever to you, I should have done so without the slightest hesitation.
('36', 291, 8, 23, 578190) But I had none then, I have none now.
('36', 291, 8, 24, 578228) I may inform you that I read the papers regarding your case and discussed it with several Sikh friends long before you wrote to me, and I told them that it was not possible even for the Sikhs to help you, and that any attempt made by them would but injure your cause and their own movement.
('36', 291, 8, 25, 578519) I am still of opinion that the mixing up of your

('36', 292, 1, 3, 578791) And this opinion, I gave even whilst I was in my sick bed at Sassoon Hospital when a deputation from Sikh friends came and waited upon me.

('36', 292, 5, 7, 579110) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('36', 292, 5, 8, 579143) I have not studied the question of influence of planets and stars upon mankind and therefore I am unable to answer your first question.
('36', 292, 5, 9, 579279) When a person is under the influence of his or her passions, she or he must seek solitude, observe perfect silence and refrain from all activities till the passions are subsided and in order to avoid activity, complete fasting is advisable while the tremor of the passion continues.
('36', 292, 5, 10, 579562) The only scientific method of studying religious books is to study a little at a time and proceed after due assimilation, never accepting .
('36', 292, 5, 11, 579702) as God’s word anything that is repugnant to one’s moral sense.
('36', 292, 5, 12, 579765) It is not possible to lay down any hard and fast rules about hours of study.
('36', 292, 5, 13, 579842) For some a few minutes suffice.
('36', 292, 5, 14, 579874) For others a few hours are enough.
('36', 292, 5, 15, 579909) Each one must find out for himself how much he can read and digest.
('36', 292, 5, 16, 579977) Merely stuffing of the brain with facts or arguments or assertions is perfectly useless.

('36', 293, 4, 5, 580417) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter with papers regarding your scheme for Depressed Classes.
('36', 293, 4, 6, 580506) It is a matter of exceeding regret to me that I cannot help you in it for the simple reason that you are partly Government aided.
('36', 293, 4, 7, 580636) I can understand and appreciate your work.
('36', 293, 4, 8, 580679) I must not be mixed up in it.
('36', 293, 4, 9, 580709) The friends who give me pecuniary help do so on the strength of my being totally independent of Government organizations.
('36', 293, 4, 10, 580831) Mine is therefore a restricted activity and restricted class of donors.
('36', 293, 4, 11, 580903) I cannot vary well approach with regard to the scheme, however laudable it may be in itself, if it is under Government patronage.
('36', 293, 4, 12, 581033) I did get the pamphlets you sent to me some time ago.
('36', 293, 4, 13, 581087) I have not yet overtaken them.

('36', 294, 4, 6, 582016) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter for which I thank you.
('36', 294, 4, 7, 582071) I understand your suggestions.
('36', 294, 4, 8, 582102) The motive behind the publication of the statistics is merely to give a rough idea of the khadi work that is being done.
('36', 294, 4, 9, 582223) Some of the information which you suggest is really unavailable.
('36', 294, 4, 10, 582288) For instance, it is not possible to know with any degree of accuracy the output [of] carders per hour, much less of yarn spun by professional spinners.
('36', 294, 4, 11, 582440) The average earned by them is obtained from books in our possession.
('36', 294, 4, 12, 582509) The output per hour can only be obtained from the spinners who in the vast majority of cases have no time sense and who spin during all the odd minutes that they spare.
('36', 294, 4, 13, 582678) The statistics obtained therefore are about as much as it was possible to get.
('36', 294, 4, 14, 582757) But as time goes by, greater and greater accuracy and fuller detail will be obtained.

('36', 295, 0, 1, 583180) 296 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 295, 1, 2, 583222) they say, too many midwives attending on a woman in labour make the delivery more difficult, and so I am of the view that when one friend is guiding a person with great love and intelligently, others may express an opinion if they feel inclined to and leave the matter there.
('36', 295, 1, 3, 583498) I believe that for many reasons the right of advising you in regard to your health belongs chiefly to Swami.
('36', 295, 1, 4, 583607) He is, moreover, an intelligent person and, therefore, I don’t feel anxious either.
('36', 295, 1, 5, 583691) There may be differences of opinion in certain matters and I make a suggestion in passing, but don’t press my view.
('36', 295, 1, 6, 583807) There is hardly any science as imperfect as the science of medicine, and, in a matter in which we are guided mostly by inferences, to press one’s view on a man who is following a certain line, and thereby create doubt in his mind, will be like spoiling the mendicant’s chances for both things, as the saying goes.
('36', 295, 1, 7, 584121) I am not particularly enamoured of Mussoorie.
('36', 295, 1, 8, 584167) We are poor people and I, therefore, do believe that we should draw the line somewhere.
('36', 295, 1, 9, 584255) As to where and when to draw it, there can be of course no fixed rule which can be applied to everyone.
('36', 295, 1, 10, 584359) All of us here will discuss with Swami what should be done in your case, and finally abide by his decision.
('36', 295, 1, 11, 584467) There is biting cold in the air here these days.
('36', 295, 1, 12, 584516) The sky is all the time overcast with clouds and the river is full to the banks.
('36', 295, 1, 13, 584597) Tanasukha’s letter had no effect on me.
('36', 295, 1, 14, 584637) The ideas expressed in it are immature.
('36', 295, 1, 15, 584677) But then, children ought to have the freedomto think even such thoughts.
('36', 295, 1, 16, 584750) Some of these errors are such as they themselves see and correct in the course of time.

('36', 296, 7, 16, 585767) On reading Narahari’s report, the cultivators of Bardoli might feel with me as an accused person is said to have felt listening to his lawyer’s speech, Tears flowed from his eyes as he listened.
('36', 296, 7, 17, 585962) On the magistrate asking him why he was crying, the accused replied that in truth he did not know that he was as innocent as the lawyer had made him out to be.
('36', 296, 7, 18, 586122) I wonder if the cultivators who have read Narahari’s report ask themselves how they are still alive though they are as poor as they are described in it.
('36', 296, 7, 19, 586275) We should not rest content with this report.
('36', 296, 7, 20, 586320) People cannot manage to live even in the manner you have described them as living.
('36', 296, 7, 21, 586403) If what you say is indeed true, there should be decrease in the number of villages and the fact of such decrease should be proved.
('36', 296, 7, 22, 586534) A given state of affairs is bound to have certain consequences.
('36', 296, 7, 23, 586598) We should collect evidence to show how many persons in Bardoli live on money earned outside, how many persons have left the place and gone elsewhere and how many fields have passed into the hands of big landlords.
('36', 296, 7, 24, 586812) We do not follow up the reports which we hear and ascertain their truth.
('36', 296, 7, 25, 586885) I have much to say about this report.
('36', 296, 7, 26, 586923) We cannot start a struggle on its basis.
('36', 296, 7, 27, 586964) It is a good one as a collection of statistics.
('36', 296, 7, 28, 587012) It may even do as a lawyer’s rejoinder, but I do not think it can serve as a basis for comparison.

('36', 297, 5, 10, 587981) I receive so many gifts from so many good friends both known and unknown to me, that it becomes impossible to do justice to them.
('36', 297, 5, 11, 588111) I have not a minute to spare to read the literature which is being sent to me.
('36', 297, 5, 12, 588190) Heaven only knows when I can read the book you have sent me.
('36', 297, 5, 13, 588251) And my difficulty is that I have not the desire which I used to have for reading.
('36', 297, 5, 14, 588333) The desire is to think, to pray and to act according to the light that God gives me.
('36', 297, 5, 15, 588418) The experiences of others, valuable though they are, cannot avail me at the present moment for, as I fancy, God has cut out my work and has left me no choice but to do the work.

('36', 298, 12, 17, 589817) BHAI NANABHAI, I got your letter and the three invitations.
('36', 298, 12, 18, 589877) I have read the latter, and return them with this.
('36', 298, 12, 19, 589928) I am sure there can be nothing to criticize in the reply which you have sent and so I will not waste your time and mine by so much as commenting on them.
('36', 298, 12, 20, 590082) You have acted correctly in regard to Narahari.

('36', 299, 3, 9, 590634) 342. SATYAGRAHA—TRUE AND FALSE
('36', 299, 4, 10, 590665) [September 12, 1926] 1
('36', 299, 5, 11, 590688) There are many forms of satyagraha, of which fasting may or may not be one, according to the circumstances of the case.
('36', 299, 5, 12, 590808) A friend has put the following poser:
('36', 299, 6, 13, 590846) A man want to recover money another owes him.
('36', 299, 6, 14, 590892) He cannot do so by going to law as he is a non co operator, and the debtor in the intoxication of the power of his wealth pays him no heed, and refuses even to accept arbitration.
('36', 299, 6, 15, 591072) If in these circumstances, the creditor sits dharna at the debtor’s
('36', 299, 7, 16, 591140) door, would it not be satyagraha?
('36', 299, 7, 17, 591174) The fasting creditor seeks to injure no one by his fasting.
('36', 299, 7, 18, 591234) Ever since the golden ageof Rama, we have been following this method.
('36', 299, 7, 19, 591304) But I am told you regard this as intimidation.
('36', 299, 7, 20, 591351) If you do, will you
('36', 299, 8, 21, 591371) kindly explain?
('36', 299, 8, 22, 591387) I know the correspondent.
('36', 299, 8, 23, 591413) He has written from the purest motive.
('36', 299, 8, 24, 591452) But I have no doubt that he is mistaken in his interpretation of satyagraha.
('36', 299, 8, 25, 591529) Satyagraha can never be resorted to for personal gain.
('36', 299, 8, 26, 591584) If fasting with a view to recovering money is to be encouraged, there would be no end of scoundrels blackmailing people by resorting to these means.
('36', 299, 8, 27, 591733) I know that many such people are to be met with in the country.
('36', 299, 8, 28, 591797) It is not right to argue that those who rightly resort to fasting need not be condemned because it is abused in a few cases.
('36', 299, 8, 29, 591922) Any and everyone may not draw his own distinction between fasting—satya graha—true and false.
('36', 299, 8, 30, 592016) What one regards as true satyagraha may very likely be otherwise.
('36', 299, 8, 31, 592082) Satyagraha, therefore, cannot be resorted to for personal gain, but only for the good of others.
('36', 299, 8, 32, 592179) A satyagrahi should

('36', 300, 1, 2, 592352) always be ready to undergo suffering and pecuniary loss.
('36', 300, 1, 3, 592409) That there would not be wanting dishonest people to reap an undue advantage from the boycott of law courts practised by good people was a contingency not unexpected at the inception of non co operation.
('36', 300, 1, 4, 592612) It was then thought that the beauty of non co operation lay just in taking those risks.
('36', 300, 1, 5, 592700) But satyagraha in the form of fasting cannot be undertaken as against an opponent.
('36', 300, 1, 6, 592783) Fasting can be resorted to only against one’s nearest and dearest, and that solely for his or her good.
('36', 300, 1, 7, 592887) In a country like India, where the spirit of charity or pity is not lacking, it would be nothing short of an outrage to resort to fasting for recovering money.
('36', 300, 1, 8, 593047) I know people who have given away money, quite against their will, but out of a false sense of pity.
('36', 300, 1, 9, 593148) The satyagrahi has, therefore, to proceed warily in a land like ours.
('36', 300, 1, 10, 593218) It is likely that some men may succeed in recovering money due to them by resorting to fasting; but instead of calling it a triumph of satyagraha, I would call it a triumph of duragraha or violence.
('36', 300, 1, 11, 593417) The triumph of satyagraha consists in meeting death in the insistence on truth.
('36', 300, 1, 12, 593497) A satyagrahi is always unattached to the attainment of the object of satyagraha; one seeking to recover money cannot be so unattached.
('36', 300, 1, 13, 593632) I am therefore clear that fasting for the sake of personal gain is nothing short of intimidation and the result of ignorance.

('36', 300, 3, 15, 593781) 343. A DILEMMA
('36', 300, 4, 16, 593796) A correspondent writes: 1
('36', 300, 5, 17, 593822) It is likely that the statement,”it would be preferable to use Eng lish cloth rather than use cloth made in Indian mills”, was quoted 2
('36', 300, 6, 18, 593958) from Hind Swaraj.
('36', 300, 6, 19, 593976) In the logical context in which the remark occurs, Iwould say today the same thing which I did in 1908. 3 It is a statement
('36', 300, 7, 20, 594100) 1 The letter is not translated here.
('36', 300, 7, 21, 594137) The correspondent had requested Gandhiji to explain the reason which had led to the change in his attitude towards textile mills in India.
('36', 300, 7, 22, 594276) In Hind Swaraj, Gandhiji had stated that it might be in the interest of the country to continue to import cloth from Manchester for some time longer rather than set up mills in the country itself, but in 1921 he had adopted the attitude that India should herself produce all the cloth required to meet her needs, even supporting Indian mills, if necessary.
('36', 300, 7, 23, 594633) 2 By Balukaka Kanetkar, at a meeting in Poona 3 Hind Swaraj was written in 1909.
('36', 301, 0, 1, 594714) 302 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 301, 1, 2, 594756) of principle, and it may not be possible to act upon it in certain circumstances.
('36', 301, 1, 3, 594838) I, therefore, drew the readers’ attention to this point in the Hindi edition of Hind Swaraj.
('36', 301, 1, 4, 594931) 1 What I have stated there is also correct in our present circumstances.
('36', 301, 1, 5, 595004) If we had not allowed ourselves to be caught in the snare of mills, if the question had merely been whether we should set up new mills and use what we suppose would be swadeshi cloth or to continue to import and use foreign cloth, I would prefer the latter course, because I do not believe that the mill industry is an activity which deserves to be spread in other parts of the world.
('36', 301, 1, 6, 595389) We could produce cloth even if we had no mill industry, produce enough to meet our needs.
('36', 301, 1, 7, 595479) We have seen from experience that we do not have to spend much time in this work.
('36', 301, 1, 8, 595561) I do not, therefore, believe that the mill industry serves any social purpose or benefits the people in any way.
('36', 301, 1, 9, 595674) But the problem is quite different, the position being exactly the opposite.
('36', 301, 1, 10, 595751) We have quite a large number of mills in the country.
('36', 301, 1, 11, 595805) It is not possible today to persuade their owners to wind them up.
('36', 301, 1, 12, 595872) Boycott of foreign cloth is not only desirable but essential; it is our duty to bring it about; we have the right to do so.
('36', 301, 1, 13, 595996) In doing that duty, we should makeuse of a means which is readily available to us.
('36', 301, 1, 14, 596079) Not to do so would augur lack of intelligence in us.
('36', 301, 1, 15, 596132) Dharma is not an absolute thing which does not change even when circumstances have changed.
('36', 301, 1, 16, 596224) If people living on the Equator follow what is dharma for people near the North Pole, they would probably be guilty of adharma 2. There is only one absolute dharma, and that is contained in God, otherwise known as truth.
('36', 301, 1, 17, 596445) The dharma of beings, who are governed by their circumstances and whose strength is limited, changes from hour to hour.
('36', 301, 1, 18, 596565) The ground on which their dharma rests is unchanging, and that is truth or, if one prefers, non violence; but, as one stands firm on this ground, there will necessarily be many changes in what dharma requires in actual practice.
('36', 301, 1, 19, 596794) We should understand the problem of mills in this light.
('36', 301, 1, 20, 596851) Otherwise, we have no reason to welcome the spread of an industry which induces cultivators to leave their fields to go to cities and live there, with their families, in narrow, dark cells without any regard for morality.
('36', 301, 1, 21, 597073) Even looking at it from the point of view of the rich, we see
('36', 301, 2, 22, 597135) 1 From the preface to the Hindi edition published in 1921, the correspondent had quoted:”My views in regard to mills have undergone this much change.
('36', 301, 2, 23, 597285) In view of the present predicament of India, we should produce in our own country all the cloth that we need even by supporting, if necessary, mills in India rather than buy cloth made in Manchester.” 2Opposite of dharma
('36', 302, 0, 1, 597506) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 303
('36', 302, 1, 2, 597551) no very elevating scenes which are due to the mill industry.
('36', 302, 1, 3, 597612) It is not an ennobling ideal merely to earn money and distribute it among a small number of share holders.
('36', 302, 1, 4, 597719) But, as the body seems to us a filthy thing when we think of it in the abstract and still we tolerate it because we cannot dispense with it, so also we should tolerate mills since in our present circumstances we cannot get rid of them, and if they serve our purpose, avail ourselves of their benefit to bring about boycott of foreign cloth.
('36', 302, 1, 5, 598060) If they do not serve even this purpose, if we discover that on the contrary they hinder our efforts to bring about such boycott, then their destruction may be considered desirable, nay necessary.

('36', 303, 10, 18, 600353) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter.
('36', 303, 10, 19, 600395) I have not read the book referred to by you.
('36', 303, 10, 20, 600440) My own personal experience and those of many others is
('36', 303, 11, 21, 600495) 1 Writing on July 28, after a silence of over 12 years, Drew described inter alia his visit to the Press at Phoenix where Indian Opinion was being printed and his meeting Manilal Gandhi whose devoted labours for his father’s weekly he commended (S.N. 10788).

('36', 304, 1, 2, 600799) at variance with the quotation sent by you.
('36', 304, 1, 3, 600843) But I think there is difference between the author’s standpoint and that of my friends and my own.
('36', 304, 1, 4, 600942) When abstinence is practised”under the false idea that the instinct is but a low pleasure” it may produce”irritability and the weakening of love”.
('36', 304, 1, 5, 601089) But when abstinence is practised for the purpose of self realization, for the purpose of husbanding vitality and for the seeking, basing [sic] love not on physical pleasure but upon soul contact, it soothes one’s nerves and purifies and therefore strengthens the bond between the two.
('36', 304, 1, 6, 601374) Most of the ills that you describe spring, in my opinion, from a wrong view of love and a wrong view of sexual relation.
('36', 304, 1, 7, 601495) Under my own plan husband and wife need not liveseparately, that is, under separate roofs, but they certainly ought not to share the same room and lock themselves in.
('36', 304, 1, 8, 601662) Long course of habit blinds us to the ugliness of men and women passing nights after nights in privacy, without any moral purpose whatsoever.
('36', 304, 1, 9, 601804) In doing so we become less even than animals.
('36', 304, 1, 10, 601850) I can see nothing wrong in husband and wife seeking privacy only for sexual act which they will perform in due humility and purely for the sake of procreation.
('36', 304, 1, 11, 602010) There will, I know, still be animal pleasure left in the act.
('36', 304, 1, 12, 602072) I would call that lawful animal pleasure.
('36', 304, 1, 13, 602114) And if we could only set our thought right and strive, in spite of the present practice to the contrary, to shape our own in accordance with the thought, I doubt not that restraint will not only be easy, but the most natural thing in the world.
('36', 304, 1, 14, 602359) I may have the handsomest girl as my sister and if the custom of kissing my sister is in vogue and in accordance with it I kiss my sister, surely no lustful thought will spring up in my breast.
('36', 304, 1, 15, 602553) Why should it be different as between husband and wife?
('36', 304, 1, 16, 602609) That it is different I know to my cost but the difference lies in our mental attitude.
('36', 304, 1, 17, 602696) We kiss our wives with the intention of satisfying the lustful pleasure.
('36', 304, 1, 18, 602769) We kiss our sisters or daughters out of lustless affection.
('36', 304, 2, 19, 602829) If the mine owners win, they will win not because there are too many miners, but because the miners do not know how to control themselves.
('36', 304, 2, 20, 602968) If every miner committed race suicide, ceased to procreate, I do not know that he will better his condition.
('36', 304, 2, 21, 603077) He will have no ambition left in him.
('36', 304, 2, 22, 603115) He will not want increase of wages.
('36', 304, 2, 23, 603151) It is difficult to forecast the future of a body of men who, not knowing the higher life, do not want to restrain themselves and would avoid the responsibilities of citizenship.

('36', 305, 6, 9, 603728) RISHABHDAS, I have your letter.
('36', 305, 6, 10, 603760) You will be doing the proper thing if you follow Bhai Dastane’s advice.
('36', 305, 6, 11, 603832) Your father must be running the business for your sake.
('36', 305, 6, 12, 603888) It is your dharma to renounce your interest in it.
('36', 305, 6, 13, 603939) If you sever your connection with it, I feel strongly that you should accept no help from your father.
('36', 305, 6, 14, 604042) You should obtain from the khadi institution what you need for the maintenance of yourself and your wife.
('36', 305, 6, 15, 604148) If friends voluntarily offer you any help, you may accept it.
('36', 305, 6, 16, 604210) They will be paying that sum only to the khadi institution.
('36', 305, 6, 17, 604270) I hope your wife is keeping good health.

('36', 305, 10, 24, 604583) After leaving this place, Bhai Abdullah went to you.
('36', 305, 10, 25, 604636) He must be an old friend by now.

('36', 306, 1, 3, 604961) I, too, have had sufficient experience of the harmlessness of uncooked food.
('36', 306, 1, 4, 605038) But experiments should be carried out in a scientific manner and on a big enough scale.
('36', 306, 1, 5, 605126) There can be no doubt, of course, that such food should be eaten in small quantity only.
('36', 306, 1, 6, 605215) Those whose stomach may have become as weak as mine, what should they do?
('36', 306, 1, 7, 605289) I can think of nothing as a substitute for milk.
('36', 306, 1, 8, 605338) The Spinners’ Association can certainly take proper precautions in its own stores to ensure that they do not sell fake khadi.
('36', 306, 1, 9, 605464) But what can it do about other stores?
('36', 306, 1, 10, 605503) The broad limit for eradication of untouchability has already been defined, which is, that the four varnas should act towards the untouchables as the first three varnas act towards the fourth.
('36', 306, 1, 11, 605696) Anyone who wishes to go beyond this, to eat in the company of untouchables, for instance, may do so of his own free will and at his own risk.
('36', 306, 1, 12, 605838) We may not refrain from eating in their company fearing that others might follow our example and be guilty of sin, for those who eat in their company commit no sin at all.
('36', 306, 1, 13, 606010) We, at any rate, eat with them because we think it meritorious to do so.
('36', 306, 1, 14, 606083) If we cease believing in the idea of pollution through touch, the restrictions in regard to eating will not be, ought not to be, considered an essential part of the caste system.
('36', 306, 1, 15, 606262) If Bhangis are forbidden to ride in tram cars in Bombay, I think that is an injustice.
('36', 306, 1, 16, 606349) Even the present caste system is based on contempt.
('36', 306, 1, 17, 606401) All trace of contempt will disappear from Hinduism, if it gets rid of the spirit of untouchability.
('36', 306, 1, 18, 606501) The notions of high and low are fruit and symptom of the disease of untouchability.
('36', 306, 1, 19, 606585) Even the history which we learn tells us that the ideas which at present have struck deep roots among us were not a part of the varna system of old days.

('36', 307, 11, 12, 607319) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, September 15, 1926 I join the chorus of welcome that will be extended to the South African Deputation that is coming on behalf of the Union Government.
('36', 307, 11, 13, 607494) 3 Let us show to them all the goodwill that we are capable of showing.
('36', 307, 11, 14, 607565) But let us not also build castles in the air.
('36', 307, 11, 15, 607611) The deputation is but a part of the Conference that is to be held in December.
('36', 307, 11, 16, 607690) They are coming with no authority for action.
('36', 307, 11, 17, 607736) They are coming merely to gain impressions.
('36', 307, 11, 18, 607780) The solution of the difficult problem that faces the statesman of South Africa and India depends upon a multiplicity of circumstances.
('36', 307, 11, 19, 607915) The coming of the deputation is one such circumstance which we must use in the best manner possible.
('36', 307, 11, 20, 608016) Let us put the deputation in the position of seeing all the sides of the picture.
('36', 307, 11, 21, 608098) In other words, they should be enabled to see the truth, the real truth, and nothing but the truth.
('36', 307, 11, 22, 608198) The case for the Indian settlers in South Africa rests upon purest justice.
('36', 307, 11, 23, 608274) An impartial study of the question therefore on the part of the South African statesmen that are coming can only do the cause good.

('36', 308, 4, 6, 608919) Your offer to send me simple Tamil sentences week by week is most tempting.
('36', 308, 4, 7, 608995) But I must resist the temptation as I have really no time left for anything more than I have on hand.

('36', 308, 11, 14, 609288) My reply is as follows: (1) No, Sir.
('36', 308, 12, 15, 609325) (2) The offer was for a plot of land at a distance of 13 miles from Johannesburg and not on long lease.
('36', 308, 12, 16, 609429) I had dissuaded the Indian residents from accepting it.
('36', 308, 12, 17, 609485) The reason is obvious.
('36', 308, 12, 18, 609508) (3) I did not receive a farthing from the Municipality.
('36', 308, 12, 19, 609564) But, it had to pay expenses in cases which it lost.
('36', 308, 12, 20, 609616) Almost all that I received from Indian settlers was handed over for public work.
('36', 308, 12, 21, 609697) (4) Both the Associations were functioning till the last and were independent of each other.
('36', 308, 13, 22, 609790) 1 The letter was in reply to the addressee’s letter of September 9, 1926, regarding South Africa, vide Appendix”Extracts from Bhavani Dayal’s Letter”, 9 9 1926. 2 This is in reply to a question whether Gandhiji had given his consent to a move on the part of Indians to surrender the Indian locations in Johannesburg to the Municipality.

('36', 309, 1, 2, 610169) (5) It is contrary to dharma to bow to anyone under force, but it is one’s dharma to bow to everyone in the world of one’s own free will; the same principle applies to the question of finger prints.
('36', 309, 1, 3, 610368) In India as also in some other countries, fingerprints are required even from persons other than prisoners.
('36', 309, 1, 4, 610476) Please remember that Mahadevji 1 danced in a naked state.
('36', 309, 1, 5, 610534) (6) Our people had objected to giving photographs too, and rightly.
('36', 309, 1, 6, 610602) In my view, it is far better to give finger prints than photographs and the method is more scientific.
('36', 309, 1, 7, 610705) (7) Your interpretation of”vested rights” is correct.
('36', 309, 1, 8, 610759) (8) I have not ignored your book but I have not finished reading it.
('36', 309, 1, 9, 610828) I am told that it is full of errors.
('36', 309, 1, 10, 610865) Not thinking it proper to discuss them, I have kept quiet.
('36', 309, 1, 11, 610924) My recollection is that you, too, had admitted some errors and written to me to express your regret.

('36', 310, 2, 3, 611551) CHARKHA IN SHAHABAD SCHOOLS
('36', 310, 3, 4, 611579) The Secretary of the Charkha Committee of the Shahabad District Board writes: 1
('36', 310, 4, 5, 611659) At the demonstration the Secretary read a report from which I take the following: 2
('36', 310, 5, 6, 611743) Whilst the Shahabad District Board is to be congratulated on the introduction of the charkha in the District Board schools, much remains to be done before the experiment can be termed a success.
('36', 310, 5, 7, 611938) Is all the yarn spun tested for its strength and evenness?
('36', 310, 5, 8, 611997) Do the boys and girls know how to repair their own charkhas?
('36', 310, 5, 9, 612058) The output is not enough for the number spinning.
('36', 310, 5, 10, 612108) There is danger of our being satisfied with a make believe.
('36', 310, 5, 11, 612168) That would be worse than no charkha.
('36', 310, 6, 12, 612205) INDIAN TEXT BOOKS
('36', 310, 7, 13, 612223) What it means to prepare real text books for India’s children may be somewhat realized from the following quotation from a letter from Mr. Gregg who is at present teaching hill children on Mr. Stokes’s farm in Kotgarh near Simla.
('36', 310, 7, 14, 612453) He says:
('36', 310, 8, 15, 612462) My time has been much occupied in preparing a re arrangement of the text books in both mathematics and physics for my pupils, such as will conform to their experience.
('36', 310, 8, 16, 612630) All English text books, and even the Indian ones, are apparently written for city bred children and presuppose familiarity with machinery and manufactured apparatus of all kinds.
('36', 310, 8, 17, 612809) These children here have never seen automobiles, steam engines, electric lights, pumps, water pipes, or even bullock carts.
('36', 310, 8, 18, 612933) So the assumptions, pictures, technical terms and arrangement of the text books of physics, and even of much of mathematics can have no reality and therefore no interest or educational value for them.
('36', 310, 8, 19, 613134) Gradually, therefore, I am putting together what will be in effect a text book on science and mathematics for Indian village children.
('36', 310, 8, 20, 613269) Since most of the children of India are in the villages, I hope it will be useful.
('36', 310, 8, 21, 613352) But Mr. Gregg’s letter opens up a much wider question.
('36', 310, 8, 22, 613407) What is
('36', 310, 9, 23, 613415) 1 Not reproduced here.
('36', 310, 9, 24, 613438) This was about a spinning demonstration by the students of primary schools of Shahabad district held on August 27. 2 Not reproduced here.
('36', 310, 9, 25, 613576) This gave an account of the progress of spinning work in the various schools.
('36', 311, 0, 1, 613654) 312 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 311, 1, 2, 613696) true of urbanized, exploiting and wealthy countries likeEngland and America cannot be true of an India predominantly rural, pauperized and exploited.
('36', 311, 1, 3, 613846) For India a multiplicity of text books means depriv ation of the vast majority of village children of the means of instruc tion.
('36', 311, 1, 4, 613975) Text books, therefore, in India must mean, principally and for the lower standards, text books for teachers, not pupils.
('36', 311, 1, 5, 614096) Indeed, I am not sure that it is not better for the children to have much of the preliminary instruction imparted to them vocally.
('36', 311, 1, 6, 614227) To impose on children of tender age a knowledge of the alphabet and the ability to read before they can gain general knowledge is to deprive them, whilst they are fresh, of the power of assimilating instruction by word of mouth.
('36', 311, 1, 7, 614456) Should, for instance, a lad of seven wait for learning the Ramayana till he can read it?
('36', 311, 1, 8, 614545) The results that we arrive at when we think of the few lacs living in the cities of India are wholly different from those we obtain when we think in terms of the millions of rural India and this, whether we think of matters educational, social, economic or apolitical Mr. Gregg’s effort, therefore, is fraught with important consequences.

('36', 311, 4, 11, 614927) A Lahore correspondent writes a pathetic letter in scholarly Hindi.
('36', 311, 4, 12, 614995) I give a free rendering of the main parts of the letter:
('36', 311, 5, 13, 615052) Hindu Muslim feuds and the feverish activity over the Council elections have thrown the non co operating students off their balance.
('36', 311, 5, 14, 615185) They have sacrificed much for the country.
('36', 311, 5, 15, 615228) Its service is their watchword.
('36', 311, 5, 16, 615260) They are today without a helmsman.
('36', 311, 5, 17, 615295) They cannot enthuse over Councils.
('36', 311, 5, 18, 615330) They do not want to take part in the Hindu Muslim feud.
('36', 311, 5, 19, 615386) They are therefore drifting towards a life of aimlessness and worse.
('36', 311, 5, 20, 615455) Must they be allowed thus to drift?
('36', 311, 5, 21, 615491) Pray remember that ultimately you are responsible for this result.
('36', 311, 5, 22, 615558) For, though nominally they obeyed the Congress call, in reality it was you they obeyed.
('36', 311, 5, 23, 615646) Is it not up to you now to guide them?
('36', 311, 5, 24, 615685) Man can make a trough, can he lead unwilling horses to it?
('36', 311, 5, 25, 615744) I sympathize with these splendid young men, but I am unable to blame myself for their drifting.
('36', 311, 5, 26, 615840) If they obeyed my call, what is there to prevent them [from] doing so now?
('36', 311, 5, 27, 615915) I am speaking with no uncertain
('36', 312, 0, 1, 615947) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 313
('36', 312, 1, 2, 615992) voice to all who will listen, to take up the gospel of the charkha.
('36', 312, 1, 3, 616060) But the fact is that in 1920 they listened not to me (and that very properly) but to the Congress.
('36', 312, 1, 4, 616159) What is perhaps more accurate, they listened to the inner voice.
('36', 312, 1, 5, 616224) The Congress call was an echo of their own longings.
('36', 312, 1, 6, 616277) They were ready for the negative part.
('36', 312, 1, 7, 616316) The call of the charkha which is the positive part of the Congress programme, for let it be remembered that it is still the Congress call, seems to make no appeal to them.
('36', 312, 1, 8, 616488) If so, there is still another much needed work which is also part of the positive programme of the Congress—the service of the untouchables.
('36', 312, 1, 9, 616629) Here, too, there is more than enough work for all the students who are pining to do national service.
('36', 312, 1, 10, 616731) Let them understand that all those who raise the moral tone of the community as a whole, all those who find occupation for the idle millions, are real builders of swaraj.
('36', 312, 1, 11, 616902) They will make easy even the purely political work.
('36', 312, 1, 12, 616954) This positive work will evoke the best in the students.
('36', 312, 1, 13, 617010) It is both post graduate and pre graduate work.
('36', 312, 1, 14, 617058) It is the only real graduating.
('36', 312, 1, 15, 617090) But it may be that neither the charkha work nor the untouchability work is exciting enough for them.
('36', 312, 1, 16, 617191) Then let them know that I am useless as a physician.
('36', 312, 1, 17, 617244) I have but a limited stock of prescriptions.
('36', 312, 1, 18, 617289) l believe in unity of disease and, therefore, also of cure.
('36', 312, 1, 19, 617349) But must a physician be blamed for his limitations, especially when he declares them from the house tops?
('36', 312, 1, 20, 617455) The students for whom the correspondent writes must be resourceful enough to find their own course in life.
('36', 312, 1, 21, 617563) Self reliance is swaraj.

('36', 312, 3, 23, 617611) 356. INFLUENCE OF ATTITUDES
('36', 312, 4, 24, 617639) I have been very interested in your articles in Young India on the
('36', 312, 5, 25, 617706) subject of birth control.
('36', 312, 5, 26, 617732) I expect you have read J. A. Hadfield’s book Psychology and Morals.
('36', 312, 5, 27, 617800) I want to draw your attention to this passage from it:
('36', 312, 6, 28, 617855) “We, therefore, speak of sexual pleasure when the expression of this instinct is alien to our moral sense; and we speak of sexual joy when the expression of this instinct is in conformity with the sentiment of love.
('36', 312, 6, 29, 618071) The too profuse breeders punish not only the poor children they breed, but also humanity in general.” 1
('36', 312, 7, 30, 618175) 1 Only extracts are reproduced here from Malcolm Muggeridge’s letter; vide also”Letter to Malcolm Muggeridge”, 12 9 1926.
('36', 313, 0, 1, 618297) 314 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 313, 1, 2, 618339) So writes a correspondent.
('36', 313, 1, 3, 618366) The letter to me is a study in mental attitudes and their influence.
('36', 313, 1, 4, 618435) Mind takes a rope to be a snake and the man with that mentality turns pale and runs away or takes up a stick to belabour the fancied snake.
('36', 313, 1, 5, 618575) Another mistakes a sister for wife and has animal passion rising in his breast.
('36', 313, 1, 6, 618655) The passion subsides, the moment he discovers his mistake.
('36', 313, 1, 7, 618714) And so in the case quoted by the correspondent.
('36', 313, 1, 8, 618762) No doubt, whilst”abstinence is practised under the false idea that the instinct is but a low pleasure”, it is likely”to produce irritability and the weakening of love”.
('36', 313, 1, 9, 618931) But if abstinence is practised with the desire to strengthen the bond of love, to purify it and to conserve the vital energy for a better purpose, instead of promoting irritability, it will promote equanimity, and instead of loosening the bond of affection, strengthen it.
('36', 313, 1, 10, 619204) Love based upon indulgence of animal passion is at best a selfish affair and likely to snap under the slightest strain.
('36', 313, 1, 11, 619324) And why should the sexual act be a sacrament in the human species, if it is not that among the lower animals?
('36', 313, 1, 12, 619434) Why should we not look at it as what it is in reality, i.e., a simple act of procreation to which we are helplessly drawn for the perpetuation of the species?
('36', 313, 1, 13, 619593) Only a man having been gifted with a free will to a limited extent exercises the human prerogative of self denial for the sake of the well being of the species, for the sake of the nobler purpose, to which he is born, than his brother animals.
('36', 313, 1, 14, 619837) It is the force of habit which makes us think the sexual act to be necessary and desirable for the promotion of love, apart from procreation, in spite of innumerable experiences to the contrary that it does not deepen love, that it is in no way necessary for its retention or enrichment.
('36', 313, 1, 15, 620125) Indeed, instances can be quoted in which that bond has grown stronger with abstinence.
('36', 313, 1, 16, 620212) No doubt abstinence must be a voluntary act undertaken for mutual moral advancement.
('36', 313, 2, 17, 620297) Human society is a ceaseless growth, an unfoldment in terms of spirituality.
('36', 313, 2, 18, 620374) If so, it must be based on ever increasing restraint upon the demands of the flesh.
('36', 313, 2, 19, 620458) Thus, marriage must be considered to be a sacrament imposing discipline upon the partners restricting them to the physical union only among themselves and for the purpose only of procreation when both the partners desire and are prepared for it.
('36', 313, 2, 20, 620704) Then, in either case supposed by the correspondent, there would be no question of sexual act outside the desire for procreation.
('36', 313, 3, 21, 620833) There is an end to all argument if we start, as my correspondent has started, with the premise that sexual act is a necessity outside of the
('36', 314, 0, 1, 620974) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 315
('36', 314, 1, 2, 621019) purpose of procreation.
('36', 314, 1, 3, 621043) The premise is vitiated in the presence of authentic instances that can be cited of complete abstinence having been practised by some of the highest among mankind in all climes.
('36', 314, 1, 4, 621221) It is no argument against the possibility or desirability of abstinence to say that it is difficult for the vast majority of mankind.
('36', 314, 1, 5, 621355) What was not possible for the vast majority a hundred years ago has been found possible today.
('36', 314, 1, 6, 621450) And what is a hundred years in the cycle of time open to us for making infinite progress?
('36', 314, 1, 7, 621540) If scientists are right, it was but yesterday that we found ourselves endowed with the human body.
('36', 314, 1, 8, 621639) Who knows, who dare prescribe, its limitations?
('36', 314, 1, 9, 621687) Indeed, every day we are discovering the infiniteness of its city 1 for good as well as evil.
('36', 314, 2, 10, 621781) If the possibility and desirability of abstinence be admitted, we must find out and devise the means of attaining it.
('36', 314, 2, 11, 621899) And as I have said in a previous article 1, life must be remodelled, if we are to live under restraint and discipline.
('36', 314, 2, 12, 622018) We may not, as the vulgar saying goes, have the cake and eat it.
('36', 314, 2, 13, 622083) If we would impose restraint upon the organs of procreation, we must impose it upon all the others.
('36', 314, 2, 14, 622183) If the eye and the ear and the nose and the tongue, the hands and the feet are let loose, it is impossible to keep the primary organ under check.
('36', 314, 2, 15, 622329) Most cases of irritability, hysteria, and even insanity which are wrongly ascribed to attempts at continence will in truth be found traceable to the incontinence of the other senses.
('36', 314, 2, 16, 622512) No sin, no breach of Nature’s laws, goes unpunished.
('36', 314, 3, 17, 622565) I must not quarrel about words.
('36', 314, 3, 18, 622597) If self control be an interference with Nature precisely in the same sense as contraceptives, be it so.
('36', 314, 3, 19, 622701) I would still maintain that the one interference is lawful and desirable because it promotes the well being of the individuals as well as society, whereas the other degrades both and, therefore, unlawful.
('36', 314, 3, 20, 622906) Self control is the surest and the only method of regulating the birth rate.
('36', 314, 3, 21, 622983) Birth control by contraceptives is race suicide.
('36', 314, 4, 22, 623032) Lastly, if the mine owners are in the wrong and still win, they will do so not because the miners over breed, but because the miners have not learnt the lesson of restraint all along the line.
('36', 314, 4, 23, 623225) If miners had no children, they would have no incentive for any betterment and they will have no provable cause for a rise in wages.
('36', 314, 4, 24, 623358) Need they drink, gamble, smoke?
('36', 314, 4, 25, 623390) Will it be any answer to say that mine owners do all these things and yet have the upper hand?
('36', 314, 4, 26, 623485) If the miners do not claim

('36', 315, 1, 3, 623686) Is it to multiply capitalists and strengthen capitalism?
('36', 315, 1, 4, 623743) We are called upon to pay homage to democracy under the promise of a better world when it reigns supreme.
('36', 315, 1, 5, 623849) Let us not reproduce on a vast scale the evils we choose to ascribe to capitalists and capitalism.
('36', 315, 1, 6, 623948) I am painfully conscious of the fact that self control is not easily attainable.
('36', 315, 1, 7, 624029) But its slowness need not ruffle us.
('36', 315, 1, 8, 624066) Haste is waste.
('36', 315, 1, 9, 624082) Impatience will not end the evil of excessive birth rate among the proletariat.
('36', 315, 1, 10, 624162) Workers among the proletariat have a tremendous task before them.
('36', 315, 1, 11, 624228) Let them not rule out of their lives the lessons of restraint that the greatest teachers among mankind have handed to us out of the rich stores of their experiences.
('36', 315, 1, 12, 624394) The fundamental truths they have given us were tested by them in a better laboratory than any equipped under the most up to date conditions.
('36', 315, 1, 13, 624535) The necessity of self control is the common teaching of them all.

('36', 315, 4, 16, 624647) The following innocent manifesto 1 has been issued in Europe by a speciall ad hoc committee whose address is 11, Abbey Road, Enfield, Middlesex, England.
('36', 315, 4, 17, 624801) Its Hon.
('36', 315, 4, 18, 624810) Secretary is Mr. H. Runham Brown:
('36', 315, 5, 19, 624844) During the War people in all the countries determined to throw off for ever the yoke of militarism, and, when peace came, the League of Nations was welcomed as the offspring of this hope.
('36', 315, 5, 20, 625032) It is our duty to see that the terrible suffering of the War does not recur.
('36', 315, 5, 21, 625109) We call for some definite step towards complete disarmament, and the demilitarizing of the mind of civilized nations.
('36', 315, 5, 22, 625227) The most effective measure towards this would be the universal abolition of conscription.
('36', 315, 5, 23, 625317) We therefore ask the League of Nations to propose the abolition of compulsory military service in all countries as a first step towards true disarmament..
('36', 315, 5, 24, 625472) It is our belief that conscript armies, with their large corps of professional officers, are a grave menace to peace.
('36', 315, 5, 25, 625590) Conscription involves the degradation of human personality, and the destruction of liberty.
('36', 315, 5, 26, 625682) Barrack life, military drill, blind obedience to commands, however unjust and foolish they may be, and deliberate training for slaughter undermine respect for the

('36', 316, 1, 2, 625983) individual, for democracy and human life.
('36', 316, 1, 3, 626025) It is debasing human dignity to force men to give up their lives, or to inflict death against their will, or without conviction as to the justice of their action.
('36', 316, 1, 4, 626188) The State which thinks itself entitled to force its citizens to go to war will never pay proper regard to the value and happiness of their lives in peace.
('36', 316, 1, 5, 626343) Moreover, by conscription the militarist spirit of aggressiveness is implanted in the whole male population at the most impressionable age.
('36', 316, 1, 6, 626483) By training for war men come to consider war as unavoidable and even desirable.
('36', 316, 1, 7, 626563) By the universal abolition of conscription, war will be made less easy.
('36', 316, 1, 8, 626635) The Government of a country which maintains conscription has little difficulty in declaring war, for it can silence the whole population by a mobilization order.
('36', 316, 1, 9, 626797) When Governments have to depend for support upon the voluntary consent of their peoples, they must necessarily exercise caution in their foreign policies.
('36', 316, 1, 10, 626952) In the first draft of the Covenant of the League of Nations, President Wilson 1 proposed to make conscription illegal in all affiliated countries.
('36', 316, 1, 11, 627099) It is our duty to restore the original spirit which created the League, a pint shared by many of those who fought in the war, and professed by many of the statesmen of the countries concerned.
('36', 316, 1, 12, 627292) By the universal abolition of conscription we can take a decisive step towards peace and liberty.
('36', 316, 1, 13, 627390) We therefore call upon all men and women of goodwill to help create in all countries a public opinion which will induce Governments and the League of Nations to take this definite step to rid the world of the spirit of militarism, and to open the way to a new era of freedom within nations and of fraternity between them.
('36', 316, 1, 14, 627712) The manifesto is signed by well known men and women from England, Finland, France, Germany, India, Sweden, Holland, Czecho slovakia, Belgium, Spain, Switzerland, Denmark, Austria, Japan and Norway.
('36', 316, 1, 15, 627910) The first step towards the abolition of the military spirit is no doubt abolition of conscription.
('36', 316, 1, 16, 628009) But the reformers will have to put up an immense struggle to secure State action in the desired direction.

('36', 317, 1, 3, 628625) The best and cheapest method of circulating the constitution is through the medium of the Press.
('36', 317, 1, 4, 628722) The draft constitution is published below.
('36', 317, 1, 5, 628765) I hope that all those who are interested in khadi will send their considered opinion as early as possible.
('36', 317, 1, 6, 628872) I invite specially the opinion of teachers and students in national educational institutions.
('36', 317, 1, 7, 628966) There is in this Khadi Service almost limitless scope.
('36', 317, 1, 8, 629021) Those who are satisfied with mere livelihood derived from service of the millions will find this Khadi Service to be attractive and all satisfying.
('36', 317, 1, 9, 629169) The opinion of teachers and students will be most valuable in enabling the Council to fix an acceptable constitution.
('36', 317, 1, 10, 629287) The following is the translation of the draft constitution.
('36', 317, 2, 11, 629347) KHADI SERVICE
('36', 317, 3, 12, 629361) There shall be under the All India Spinners’ Association a service called the ‘Khadi Service’.
('36', 317, 3, 13, 629456) No one shall in future be accepted as a member of that service who does not hold a certificate from the Technical Department of the Association at present situated at the Satyagraha Ashram, Sabarmati.
('36', 317, 4, 14, 629657) QUALIFICATIONS OF CANDIDATES
('36', 317, 5, 15, 629686) No one who has not completed his 16th year, who has not a competent knowledge of the vernacular of his province, and of arithmetic, and who does not produce a certificate of good conduct and health, shall be admitted for instruction in the Technical Department.
('36', 317, 6, 16, 629948) INSTRUCTION
('36', 317, 7, 17, 629960) The course of instruction shall be not less than two years and shall include: (a) all the processes that cotton has to go through up to weaving, that is, gathering, ginning, carding, spinning and weaving; (b) a knowledge of Hindi or Hindustani, where candidates come from a province where Hindi or Hindustani is not the vernacular; (c) a knowledge of book keeping—indigenous and Western.
('36', 317, 7, 18, 630348) When the candidate has obtained a certificate of competency to the foregoing he will be sent to a khadi karyalaya in any of the provinces to gain practical experience for one season which extends to nearly 8 months.
('36', 317, 7, 19, 630564) Any candidate who has obtained a satisfactory

('36', 318, 1, 2, 630655) certificate from the head of the depot to which he has been sent for practical experience shall be enrolled as a member of the Khadi Service, provided, however, that no one shall be so enrolled who has either broken down in character or health during the course of instruction.
('36', 318, 1, 3, 630933) Any person so enrolled will be liable to serve in any depot wherever he is required by the Association.
('36', 318, 1, 4, 631037) The salary shall be per month Rs. .
('36', 318, 1, 5, 631073) subject to such increase as may be fixed from time to time by the Khadi Service Board to be appointed by the Association.
('36', 318, 1, 6, 631195) Every candidate who wishes to avail himself of the Khadi Service shall be required on joining to sign the contract of service to be framed by the said board.
('36', 318, 2, 7, 631353) MISCELLANEOUS
('36', 318, 3, 8, 631367) Persons who do not wish to join the Khadi Service may also be admitted for instruction in the Technical Department.
('36', 318, 3, 9, 631483) Preference, however, will always be given to those who wish to enter the Khadi Service.
('36', 318, 3, 10, 631571) There will be a short course of 3 months for those who merely want to learn hand spinning and all the antecedent processes, that is, ginning, carding and sliver making.
('36', 318, 3, 11, 631740) Every applicant for instruction whose application has been accepted will be required to deposit return fare for the place from which he or she comes, plus Rs. 3 to be utilized for his or her return in the event of his or her being dismissed from any cause whatsoever.
('36', 318, 4, 12, 632008) SCHOLARSHIP
('36', 318, 5, 13, 632020) A monthly scholarship of Rs. 12 for board, and free lodging, shall be given to those candidates for instruction who are thought to the entire satisfaction of the Director of the Technical Department to be too poor to pay for their board.
('36', 318, 5, 14, 632258) No monetary payment will be made where the Department is able to conduct a common boarding house for candidates.
('36', 318, 6, 15, 632371) RESERVATION
('36', 318, 7, 16, 632383) The Council reserves the right to alter or amend the constitution from time to time and frame by laws, fix the terms of service, rules of discipline and deal with other matters not covered by the constitution.
('36', 318, 7, 17, 632593) Nothing in this constitution shall affect the rights of those who are already in the employment of the A.I.S.A.

('36', 320, 3, 4, 634352) SABARMATI, September 17, 1926
('36', 320, 4, 5, 634382) MY DEAR CHILD, The Roman Catholic fast which you refer to in your letter is really no fasting at all, but there is or there was a real fast also amongst them.
('36', 320, 4, 6, 634541) However, whether they have or they had or not is of no consequence to us.
('36', 320, 4, 7, 634615) Neither fasting nor anything else that is imposed from without can be of any value.
('36', 320, 4, 8, 634699) You need not have apologized for raising the question about Christ.
('36', 320, 4, 9, 634767) In spite of most devout attention to every word ascribed to Jesus in the New Testament and in spite of my having read in a humble spirit all about Jesus, I have really not seen any fundamental distinction between him and the other great teachers.
('36', 320, 4, 10, 635014) That you see a vast difference between Jesus and the other teachers I can understand, explain and appreciate.
('36', 320, 4, 11, 635124) That is the teaching you have imbibed from childhood and you would read everything else with that unconscious conviction.
('36', 320, 4, 12, 635246) Nobody taught me in my childhood to differentiate.
('36', 320, 4, 13, 635297) I have therefore grown without bias one way or the other.
('36', 320, 4, 14, 635355) I can pay equal homage to Jesus, Muhammed, Krishna, Buddha, Zoroaster and others that may be named.
('36', 320, 4, 15, 635455) But this is not a matter for argument.
('36', 320, 4, 16, 635494) It is a matter for each one’s deep and sacred conviction.
('36', 320, 4, 17, 635552) I have no desire whatsoever to dislodge you from the exclusive homage you pay to Jesus.
('36', 320, 4, 18, 635640) But I would like you to understand and appreciate the other inclusive position.
('36', 320, 4, 19, 635720) What Menon has told you about the pecuniary difficulty is quite correct.
('36', 320, 4, 20, 635793) But so is your remark 1. You will come here if God makes the way clear for you.

('36', 321, 3, 4, 636116) MY DEAR FRIEND, I have your latest letter and the previous one also.
('36', 321, 3, 5, 636185) I had intended to acknowledge the previous letter 1 but pressure of work has prevented me from doing so.
('36', 321, 3, 6, 636290) I have, however, been keeping myself in touch with you through Swami Anand, and latterly through Mirabai.
('36', 321, 3, 7, 636396) You have given me no cause whatsoever for displeasure and let me assure you that it is difficult for me to be easily displeased.
('36', 321, 3, 8, 636525) I detected in your letters overmuch suspicion.
('36', 321, 3, 9, 636572) Have you made yourself certain that your letters are intercepted or opened?
('36', 321, 3, 10, 636648) 2 And if they are, why not be totally indifferent?
('36', 321, 3, 11, 636699) Instead of having Young India by registered post, will it not be better to have double copies, the second copy to follow next week, so as to ensure delivery either one week or the other?
('36', 321, 3, 12, 636886) I suppose there is nothing to prevent the postal department from intercepting registered letters.
('36', 321, 3, 13, 636984) If I were you, I would even offer to show them all the periodicals and letters I should receive if only they will deliver them promptly to me.

('36', 321, 8, 18, 637249) I have your letter.
('36', 321, 8, 19, 637269) I will send something to the German friend as per your advice.
('36', 321, 8, 20, 637332) The boils were merely a figment of the imagination, and the imagination being braced up by the fresh breeze of Mussoorie, the boils have disappeared.
('36', 321, 8, 21, 637482) I see you are quite in your element there.
('36', 321, 8, 22, 637525) I hope you have persuaded yourself to stay there

('36', 322, 1, 3, 637774) I assure you, neither Kripalani nor the students will take it amiss and I shall apologize for your absence and, if you like, take the burden of your sin if it is transferable.
('36', 322, 1, 4, 637950) But I would like that distant chirp from Mussoorie rather than your boilful, constipated chirp from close quarters.
('36', 322, 1, 5, 638066) I believe in the Latin proverb mens sana in corpore sano.
('36', 322, 1, 6, 638124) Devdas tells me you have an adopted son in Lucknow.
('36', 322, 1, 7, 638176) I would strongly advise you not to go to your son till the cold weather or rather cool weather has set in.
('36', 322, 1, 8, 638283) I would, therefore, like you to stay in Mussoorie as long as possible or ask the son of your adoptions to found a home in a cooler place and take you there.

('36', 322, 7, 14, 638556) DEAR FRIEND I have your letter giving me a copy of your speech delivered at the Dadabhoy 1 Jayanti.
('36', 322, 7, 15, 638656) I have read your speech.
('36', 322, 7, 16, 638681) Whilst it is good, I do not see anything original about it and you have introduced a thought about Dadabhoy which, perhaps, he himself, if he was alive, would repudiate.
('36', 322, 7, 17, 638851) Dadabhoy’s appeal was first and foremost to the self in us, secondarily to the outsiders.
('36', 322, 7, 18, 638941) I am returning your speech as requested by you.

('36', 323, 3, 4, 639199) SABARMATI, September 17, 1926
('36', 323, 4, 5, 639229) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('36', 323, 4, 6, 639262) Here are my answers: 1. I have simply cited the instance of George Muller as I have heard.
('36', 323, 4, 7, 639353) I believe in the possibility of a heart prayer being answered in the manner George Muller’s is supposed to have been.
('36', 323, 4, 8, 639471) It does not mean that George Muller did not work for his daily bread.
('36', 323, 4, 9, 639541) He prayed for the support of a philanthropic institution which he conducted.
('36', 323, 4, 10, 639618) His life otherwise was a most strenuous life.
('36', 323, 4, 11, 639664) But it is said of him that he never stretched forth his hand for begging except to God.
('36', 323, 4, 12, 639752) 2. I have not studied the miracles from the miraculous standpoint.
('36', 323, 4, 13, 639819) I neither believe nor disbelieve them.
('36', 323, 4, 14, 639858) I hold that they ought not to affect our conduct one way or the other.
('36', 323, 4, 15, 639929) 3. I think it is highly probable that the period of our life is fixed, that is to say, the number of breaths we are to take, but that it is possible for us to regulate the duration of breaths and thus apparently prolong life.
('36', 323, 4, 16, 640155) This is a question of which I have not made any study and I do not allow it to worry me.
('36', 323, 4, 17, 640244) I have, therefore, given you not my own experience or positive belief but that belief of some people which has commended itself to me.
('36', 323, 4, 18, 640379) 4. They have no doubt a cooling effect.
('36', 323, 4, 19, 640419) But they are also in a way stimulants.
('36', 323, 4, 20, 640458) But you should know that at the present moment I am not myself discarding at least goat’s milk.
('36', 323, 4, 21, 640554) But my belief in the advisability, wherever health permits, of avoiding milk and its products—curds, etc.,—for the sake of making brahmacharya easier to practise remains unchanged.
('36', 323, 4, 22, 640735) 5. It is a fact that I forgo the last meal if I have not been able to take it before sunset.
('36', 323, 4, 23, 640828) It is a good, rule for a brahmachari to follow.
('36', 323, 4, 24, 640876) 6. I do take walking exercise regularly.
('36', 323, 4, 25, 640917) I keep myself fit for work by regular habits and by a proper selection of food and observing moderation in the quantity I fake and by exercising restraint upon the other senses.
('36', 323, 4, 26, 641095) 7. Monday is a day of silence for me.
('36', 323, 4, 27, 641133) I do edit Young India at least partly on Mondays but, since the operation, I have not been

('36', 324, 1, 2, 641269) fasting on Mondays.
('36', 324, 1, 3, 641289) I do recommend a weekly fast to young men who lead busy lives and who are not particular about the quality and the quantity of the food they take.
('36', 324, 1, 4, 641436) A weekly fast wisely managed is a help rather than a hindrance to the performance of all work, especially when it is mental.
('36', 324, 1, 5, 641561) 8. A teacher best serves his pupils by living an absolutely exemplary life in every particular and by completely identifying himself with his pupils.

('36', 324, 6, 11, 641888) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter for which I thank you.
('36', 324, 6, 12, 641943) Let us not confuse the issue by raising the question of divorce.
('36', 324, 6, 13, 642008) The only question to be considered is whether a widow should have the same right and free choice as the widower, and, secondly, whether a girl of tender years, even 15, who has been practically forcibly raped and after the rape becomes, according to the present mistaken belief, a widow, should have the right to marry, or if you like, to remarry a properly qualified person or not.
('36', 324, 6, 14, 642391) I would like you not to be shocked at the use of the word rape in this connection.
('36', 324, 6, 15, 642474) I want you to be shocked at what is today happening in our society.
('36', 324, 6, 16, 642542) Today the chastity which we impute to widows has been discovered to be amiss.
('36', 324, 6, 17, 642620) Secret vice that is corrupting society and which now and then sees light of day should be a sufficient warning to us against taking the name of purity, religion, morality in connection with widowhood.
('36', 324, 6, 18, 642821) What we need to be protected against is not the absolutely necessary remarriage of young widows but the inhuman lust of men in Hindu society.
('36', 324, 6, 19, 642963) Have you studied the
('36', 325, 0, 1, 642984) 326 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

('36', 325, 1, 4, 643149) Such cases happened only the other day in Western India and in southern India and I have knowledge of such cases all over India.

('36', 326, 1, 3, 644575) Let us recognize our limitations in all humility.
('36', 326, 1, 4, 644625) We are not gods but mere frail insignificant human beings.
('36', 326, 1, 5, 644684) We have no Government to help us.
('36', 326, 1, 6, 644718) Even our own organization, the Congress, is shattered to pieces.
('36', 326, 1, 7, 644783) We have no control over an army of workers.
('36', 326, 1, 8, 644827) We are scattered individuals.

('36', 326, 1, 11, 645010) You should simply select an area which you can cope with and settle down there and develop it steadily in every way.
('36', 326, 1, 12, 645127) No more is required of you or any single soul on earth than this.
('36', 326, 1, 13, 645193) You will have given all you have in the best manner possible.
('36', 326, 1, 14, 645255) I wish I could send you someone.
('36', 326, 1, 15, 645288) Unfortunately, I have no one who can go there and organize.
('36', 326, 1, 16, 645348) That is my limitation.
('36', 326, 1, 17, 645371) You should yourself become an expert and if you have any worker, he should become an expert.
('36', 326, 1, 18, 645464) What is Govinda Babu doing?
('36', 326, 1, 19, 645492) And is there no expert yet trained in Khadi Department?
('36', 326, 1, 20, 645548) Orissa haunts me like a nightmare.
('36', 326, 1, 21, 645583) Such a splendid country and yet poverty stricken; its workers good and yet so helpless.
('36', 326, 1, 22, 645671) Do not wear away your constitution uselessly going about, but preserve it by observing the simple rules of health.

('36', 327, 6, 13, 646960) I do not feel inclined to publish it in Young India unless I can verify the information you have given from the experience of several other people.
('36', 327, 6, 14, 647108) I am in touch with men who have gone in for these postures but they are not able to certify to the certainty of the result that in your own case has beenfortunately attained.
('36', 327, 6, 15, 647283) I am forwarding your letter to the Swami 1 himself for his criticism.

('36', 328, 6, 9, 648194) The only thing I can suggest for your friend is that he should have no excitement.
('36', 328, 6, 10, 648277) He should live allthe 24 hours in the open air.
('36', 328, 6, 11, 648325) He should be constantly keeping his body and mind engaged in pure work and pure thought.
('36', 328, 6, 12, 648414) He should take such gentle exercise as would not unduly tire him.
('36', 328, 6, 13, 648480) He should omit pulse, eat rice sparingly, avoid all condiments, and he should take a hip bath in cold water daily on an empty stomach.
('36', 328, 6, 14, 648615) And he must pray incessantly to God for a pure heart.
('36', 328, 6, 15, 648669) He must retire early to bed and get up very early.

('36', 329, 3, 4, 648965) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('36', 329, 3, 5, 648998) You can learn carding and spinning without any difficulty in Bombay if you apply to Mrs. Avantikabai Gokhale, Bhatwadi, Girgaum or to Mr. Vithaldas Jerajani, Khadi Bhandar, Princess Street, Bombay or to Mr. Kotak, Khadi Bhandar, Kalbadevi, Bombay.
('36', 329, 3, 6, 649246) And when you have acquired the art, you can learn weaving by going to one of the khadi centres such as Bardoli, Ahmedabad, etc.
('36', 329, 3, 7, 649374) But if you become an expert in carding and spinning, it is unnece ssary for you to become a weaver, because the race of weavers is not yet dead and all the yarn you spin can be easily woven.

('36', 329, 8, 12, 649671) BHAISHRI NARAHARI, You have not asked for a reply to your letter, but I wished to write a long one.
('36', 329, 8, 13, 649771) In my view the step which you have taken is correct.
('36', 329, 8, 14, 649824) I understand Nanabhai’s point of view, but to me wearing khadi and spinning are as essential a part of education as learning Gujarati.
('36', 329, 8, 15, 649959) This is not being a missionary.
('36', 329, 8, 16, 649991) I shall be patient in regard to your decision.

('36', 330, 1, 2, 650262) 375. MY NOTES
('36', 330, 2, 3, 650276) PERENNIAL QUESTIONS
('36', 330, 3, 4, 650296) A reader of Navajivan charged with spiritual aspiration insists on his questions being answered through Navajivan.
('36', 330, 3, 5, 650411) I feel some hesitation and am also doubtful whether Navajivan is the appropriate place for answering these questions, which moreover are not new.
('36', 330, 3, 6, 650557) They have troubled people since time immemorial.
('36', 330, 3, 7, 650606) Nevertheless, I cannot bring myself to reject the correspondent’s request.
('36', 330, 3, 8, 650681) I, therefore, venture to reproduce here his questions and my answers to them.
('36', 330, 4, 9, 650759) Should one meditate on God?
('36', 330, 4, 10, 650787) One has to do this so that one may know God through the intellect and feel His presence in the heart.
('36', 330, 5, 11, 650889) If meditation is essential, how should it be done?
('36', 330, 5, 12, 650940) All transcending and without form, God cannot be apprehended even through meditation.
('36', 330, 5, 13, 651026) Meditating on the impersonal is hard for embodied beings.
('36', 330, 5, 14, 651084) So one should meditate on a manifestation of God in personal form.
('36', 330, 5, 15, 651151) In this age and in this country, that form is Daridranarayana.
('36', 330, 5, 16, 651214) The only way of meditating on Him is to serve the poor.
('36', 330, 5, 17, 651270) There may be different ways of serving the poor, but in India the root cause of poverty is idleness and unemployment.
('36', 330, 5, 18, 651388) In order that people may shake off their laziness, we should spin ourselves and persuade them also to spin and thereby provide them innocent employment.
('36', 330, 5, 19, 651541) With every breath we take, we should utter this name, Daridranarayana, and should see him in our imagination pleased and smiling with satisfaction with every revolution of the spinning wheel.
('36', 330, 6, 20, 651733) What are the attributes of God?
('36', 330, 6, 21, 651765) The answer to this question is included in what is stated above, and it does not, therefore, require a separate answer.
('36', 330, 6, 22, 651885) But let me repeat it and say that He alone knows His attributes, or, rather, that those who have been able to know them have not succeeded in expressing them in words.
('36', 330, 6, 23, 652053) He is beyond the reach of language; the language in which He can be adequately described has not yet been discovered.
('36', 330, 6, 24, 652171) So it is that we worship Him as Matsya 1, Varah 2, Narsimha 3, or in human form 4, as suits the temperament of each of us.
('36', 330, 6, 25, 652294) In doing this, all of us

('36', 331, 1, 2, 652505) simultaneously follow and do not follow truth.
('36', 331, 1, 3, 652552) We follow it from our point of view, but do not follow it from the point of view of others who disagree with us.
('36', 331, 1, 4, 652665) In the eyes of God, we both follow and do not follow truth.
('36', 331, 2, 5, 652725) SPINNING WHEEL AND SELF PURIFICATION
('36', 331, 3, 6, 652762) A worker writes from Vedchhi: 1
('36', 331, 4, 7, 652794) One is rewarded according to one’s faith.
('36', 331, 4, 8, 652836) A Farahad breaking stones for a living got a Shirin.
('36', 331, 4, 9, 652889) The spinning wheel will have the power which we put into it.
('36', 331, 4, 10, 652950) If the sacred mantra and similar verbal symbols have immense power in them, it is because we have absolute faith in their power and do tapascharya in order that our faith may bear fruit.
('36', 331, 4, 11, 653137) In the same way, if we try to spread the use of the spinning wheel with the faith that we shall thereby serve the poor and purify both society and ourselves, and if we do tapascharya, even lay down our lives, in order that our faith may be rewarded, it certainly will be rewarded.
('36', 331, 5, 12, 653418) Something like this has happened in Vedchhi.
('36', 331, 5, 13, 653463) Propaganda against the drink evil can succeed only if carried on in this spirit.
('36', 331, 5, 14, 653544) A drink addict will not respond if we simply ask him to give up drinking.
('36', 331, 5, 15, 653618) It is a language which he does not understand.
('36', 331, 5, 16, 653665) If, however, we live as his neighbour and, by our example, persuade him to employ himself in useful work, he would give up drinking.
('36', 331, 5, 17, 653798) The drink addicts in Vedchhi seem to have responded to such an appeal.
('36', 331, 5, 18, 653869) We would succeed in all other places if we worked with similar patience and faith.
('36', 331, 6, 19, 653952) But I should like to say one thing to all workers so that they may be vigilant.
('36', 331, 6, 20, 654032) The change which we see now will prove illusory and disappear in a few days if the work is not kept up.
('36', 331, 6, 21, 654136) To ensure that the transformation in the lives of the people becomes permanent, the workers in the respective villages should remain alert and go on with their work without stopping or relaxing their effort.
('36', 331, 8, 22, 654344) 1The letter is not translated here.
('36', 331, 8, 23, 654380) The correspondent had described the transformation in the lives of Chodharas in the Bardoli taluka in Gujarat since the spinning wheel had been introduced among them.

('36', 332, 7, 8, 654800) [BOMBAY, September 19, 1926]
('36', 332, 8, 9, 654829) He maintains that improvement of the masses is becoming progressively more acute every year, and his remedy is to encourage the peasant, who is unemployed for a great portion of the year while the weather is unpropitious, to take to spinning as a means of increasing his income, and of preventing the exploitation of India by the overseas manufacturer.
('36', 332, 8, 10, 655182) Foreign manufacturers take £40,000,000 from India annually for cotton cloth, and this can be saved if my charkha (spinning wheel) movement receives adequate support.
('36', 332, 9, 11, 655348) He admitted that the foreign cloth, or the mill cloth of India, was a better and cheaper textile than the homespun; but when asked whether his movement as a remonstrance against the overwhelming forces of labour saving machinery and mass production was not as futile as the action of those who destroyed labour saving machinery in England to keep up the number of hand workers, he demurred, adding that Indian philosophy was such that his movement was bound to succeed.
('36', 332, 9, 12, 655818) (A millowner’s subsequent rejoinder to this contention was:”But how can it succeed when hand spinning can only earn one third of what can be earned daily by mill hands at incomparably easier work?”) In reply to questions, Gandhiji said the movement was”deeply religious”, though without ritual—but propagated by some literature and the holding of meetings.
('36', 332, 9, 13, 656175) He claimed that the mere introduction of

('36', 332, 10, 15, 656253) The correspondent had reproduced in the letter a song which an old woman had recited to him and which she herself had learnt from her mother who used to sing it while spinning.
('36', 332, 10, 16, 656430) 2 On September 18 Gandhiji left Ahmedabad to greet the members of the South African Delegation in Bombay.
('36', 332, 10, 17, 656536) This meeting took place on September 19 in Sarojini Naidu’s rooms at the Taj Mahal Hotel.
('36', 332, 10, 18, 656626) The extract is from a report by the correspondent of The Natal Advertiser datelined: Poona, September 21, reproduced by The Hindu.

('36', 333, 4, 6, 657087) MY DEAR CHARLIE, The Bombay Samachar mistook me for you and published the information that I was ill.
('36', 333, 4, 7, 657189) So they thought I was not coming.

('36', 333, 4, 9, 657291) But it turned out to be only a rumour.
('36', 333, 4, 10, 657330) I had a long chat with all the members of the deputation, at Mrs. Naidu’s room.
('36', 333, 4, 11, 657410) We talked most of the time about khaddar.
('36', 333, 4, 12, 657452) They wanted to know why I was so heavily clad.
('36', 333, 4, 13, 657499) The answer was a sermon on khaddar in which they were deeply interested.
('36', 333, 4, 14, 657572) Did not see Jahangir anywhere.
('36', 333, 4, 15, 657603) Met Sir M. Habibulla and had a long chat.
('36', 333, 4, 16, 657645) Yes, I may come tomorrow and spin to amuse you.

('36', 334, 9, 15, 658527) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter 3 together with the original terms from the Macmillan Company.
('36', 334, 9, 16, 658622) There is only one exception that I feel should be made to clause 1. Cession of the rights to the English speaking world should not include India.
('36', 334, 9, 17, 658768) My desire is to let the English knowing public in India have the cheapest possible edition and I think too that the Indian edition should be published in India.
('36', 334, 9, 18, 658929) The circulation of the Indian edition can be easily restricted to India.
('36', 334, 9, 19, 659002) I suppose the Macmillan Company know that I propose publishing parts in book form now as each part is completed from time to time.
('36', 334, 9, 20, 659133) This would remain unaffected by the proposed contract.
('36', 334, 9, 21, 659188) It is open to them if they wish to publish the book in parts, in which case circulation of parts outside India can be stopped.

('36', 335, 3, 4, 659666) DEAR FRIEND, I appreciate the fact that you are continuously thinking of me.
('36', 335, 3, 5, 659743) I did not know that you had taken up residence at North Shepstone.
('36', 335, 3, 6, 659810) I hope Mrs. Baker is profiting by her stay at the beautiful seaside.
('36', 335, 3, 7, 659879) I do hold with you that truth is one, but we only see it through the glass darkly, and only in part and each according to his light.
('36', 335, 3, 8, 660012) The result is naturally a multitude of viewpoints.
('36', 335, 3, 9, 660063) But if all proceed like the beams of the sun from one central fact, all is well.
('36', 335, 3, 10, 660144) But I don’t want to argue.

('36', 335, 9, 18, 660397) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('36', 335, 9, 19, 660430) I must say I do not like your khaddar programme.
('36', 335, 9, 20, 660479) You do not advance the cause of khadi by importing Chandpur spun yarn and getting it woven there.
('36', 335, 9, 21, 660577) What you want to spread is spinning among your boys.
('36', 335, 9, 22, 660630) They may become weavers by all means but then they must weave what they themselves spin.
('36', 335, 9, 23, 660719) If you will only get your boys to spin, the whole of your stock of cotton can be consumed on the spot.
('36', 335, 9, 24, 660822) And surely there must be some volunteers

('36', 336, 7, 10, 661458) DEAR DR.
('36', 336, 7, 11, 661467) SATYAPAL I have your letter.
('36', 336, 7, 12, 661496) I wish I could persuade you not to embark upon this newspaper enterprise.
('36', 336, 7, 13, 661570) It can do no earthly good.
('36', 336, 7, 14, 661597) We have too many papers and I am satisfied that you will not advance the national cause by adding one more to the army of newspapers that have already grown into a nuisance.
('36', 336, 7, 15, 661771) If you have got honest workers by your side, why engage them in writing what everybody knows?
('36', 336, 7, 16, 661865) Why not take whatever constructive work they are capable of doing?
('36', 336, 7, 17, 661932) Each worker is worth more than a newspaper.
('36', 336, 7, 18, 661976) You will only make [for] turbidity of the atmosphere by launching out upon your enterprise.
('36', 336, 7, 19, 662068) But if I cannot persuade [you] to desist at least do pleaselet me have my own way.
('36', 336, 7, 20, 662151) Recently I have been declining to write for newspapers altogether.
('36', 336, 7, 21, 662218) But there the main reason is health consideration.
('36', 336, 7, 22, 662269) I am altogether overworked.
('36', 336, 7, 23, 662297) If I can help it I would even stop writing for Young India and Navajivan for the time being but that I dare not do.
('36', 336, 7, 24, 662413) However, I do not want to put you off with any other reason but the main one.

('36', 337, 10, 23, 663705) The Director of Industries in Mysore, Mr. Z. Meccai, has prepared an interesting note on hand spinning in Mysore.
('36', 337, 10, 24, 663819) I publish
('36', 337, 11, 25, 663829) 1 It appears this was sent care of Motilal Nathusha.

('36', 338, 1, 2, 663955) the following condensation of the notes: 1
('36', 338, 2, 3, 663998) I congratulate the Mysore authorities upon the encouragement they are giving to the revival of the only universals cottage industry of India.
('36', 338, 2, 4, 664140) I commend to their attention the experience of the All India Spinners’ Association.
('36', 338, 2, 5, 664224) It has found by experiment and observation that it is advisable to introduce hand ginning simultaneously with hand spinning.
('36', 338, 2, 6, 664349) This is easiest in the districts where cotton is grown.
('36', 338, 2, 7, 664405) Where it is not grown but where it is possible to grow, encouragement should be given to grow it locally.
('36', 338, 2, 8, 664511) Machine ginned and machine pressed cotton loses its vitality and is more difficult to treat with the hand bow than hand ginned cotton.
('36', 338, 2, 9, 664646) In several parts of India, the spinners take seed cotton.
('36', 338, 2, 10, 664704) Spinners should also be encouraged to do their own carding.
('36', 338, 2, 11, 664764) The performance by the spinner of the two processes doubles his wage.
('36', 338, 2, 12, 664834) With a view to increasing the strength of hand spun yarn, the State should undertake periodically to test the hand spun yarn and publish results.
('36', 338, 2, 13, 664980) Indeed, the whole subject needs to be treated in a scientific manner.
('36', 338, 2, 14, 665050) And who can be more fitted to do so than a State like Mysore?

('36', 338, 4, 16, 665135) 387. NON RESISTANCE TRUE AND FALSE
('36', 338, 5, 17, 665170) America is the home of inter racial conflict on a vast scale.
('36', 338, 5, 18, 665232) There are earnest men and women in that land of enterprises who are seeking to solve the difficult problem along the lines of non resistance.
('36', 338, 5, 19, 665374) One such American 2 friend sends me a paper called the Inquiry which contains an interesting discussion on the doctrine of non resistance.
('36', 338, 5, 20, 665513) It consists of instances that might possibly be grouped under non resistance.
('36', 338, 5, 21, 665591) I select three samples:
('36', 338, 6, 22, 665615) A Chinese student related his experiences at the State University from which he was about to graduate.
('36', 338, 6, 23, 665718) His reception there had been anything but friendly for the most part, although a few men had gone out of their way to befriend him one of them even inviting the Chinese to his home for a week end.
('36', 338, 6, 24, 665915) On the other hand, a fellow student who occupied a room next to his made himself particularly obnoxious, throwing shoes against his door and
('36', 338, 7, 25, 666056) 1 This is not reproduced here.
('36', 338, 7, 26, 666087) It furnished a detailed report of the measures taken by the Mysore Industries Department to promote hand spinning.
('36', 338, 7, 27, 666202) 2 This was a mistake.
('36', 338, 7, 28, 666224) The sender was not an American but an Indian; vide”A Correction”, 7 10 1926.

('36', 339, 1, 2, 666343) indulging in other pranks.
('36', 339, 1, 3, 666370) The Chinese overheard this student express horror on finding that an American had taken him home to introduce him to his mother and sister, and immediately he made up his mind that he would teach this student to respect him, not for his own sake, but for the sake of his dear motherland.
('36', 339, 1, 4, 666658) So he went out of his way to be friendly to his neighbour.
('36', 339, 1, 5, 666717) Every day he gave him a smiling good morning though at first he received no response.
('36', 339, 1, 6, 666803) He ignored every insult, but tried to make himself pleasant and useful.
('36', 339, 1, 7, 666875) When he knew his neighbour to be hard up he casually invited him to go to a movie with him.
('36', 339, 1, 8, 666967) Gradually they talked together more often and found that they had several interests in common.
('36', 339, 1, 9, 667062) After a while this student invited him to his home.
('36', 339, 1, 10, 667114) “We have become warm friends,” concluded the Chinese.”I have since spent many holidays and week ends at his home; and on leaving the university I shall know that one of my fellow students at least will regretfully miss me.” The secretary of a railroad Young Men’s Christian Association brought one evening into the building twelve Danes, working on the railroad, who had no place to sleep.
('36', 339, 1, 11, 667504) The English speaking men, under the sway of racial antipathy, began to object and protested against the foreigners being brought in.
('36', 339, 1, 12, 667637) Among these newcomers however was a skilled musician, who, while the Americans were presenting their objections to the secretary, began to play upon the accordion.
('36', 339, 1, 13, 667801) He discoursedsweet music, which soon had its effect.
('36', 339, 1, 14, 667854) The ire on the faces of the native born soon began to vanish; the censure died on their lips; their hearts were softened; and that night they sat up late listening to the foreigner playing—Peter Roberts, The New Immigration.

('36', 339, 2, 17, 668156) Several years ago some real estate agents sought to sell a considerable amount of land to other Japanese, and the white people were aroused at the thought of a great influx of these people.
('36', 339, 2, 18, 668346) Meetings were held and a big sign was put on the main boulevard which read:”No Japanese wanted here.” The old resident Japanese of X, who had lived on good terms with the white people being members of their Farmers’ Association, went to the white people and, after consultation finally agreed with them that a further increase in the Japanese population would not be a Good thing.
('36', 339, 2, 19, 668727) The sign was changed to read:”No more Japanese wanted here.” The person who tells this story contends that this action advanced the solidarity of the community and improved relations between the whites and the Japanese in that place, as witness the following: “The Japanese of X, learning that the American church was in financial
('36', 340, 0, 1, 669058) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 341
('36', 340, 1, 2, 669103) difficulties offered to give a definite amount yearly for its support, in addition to carrying on their own Japanese church work.” Now the first easily comes under true non resistance.
('36', 340, 1, 3, 669288) The second is more an instance of presence of mind than non resistance.
('36', 340, 1, 4, 669360) The third, from the facts as stated, is an instance, if not of cowardice, as contended by some of the debators, certainly of selfishness.
('36', 340, 1, 5, 669498) The resident Japanese population in order to retain their earthly possessions agreed to the prohibition of further Japanese immigration.
('36', 340, 1, 6, 669635) It may have been sound policy.
('36', 340, 1, 7, 669666) It may have been the only policy advisable.
('36', 340, 1, 8, 669710) But it was not non resistance.
('36', 340, 1, 9, 669741) Non resistance is restraint voluntarily undertaken for the good of society.
('36', 340, 1, 10, 669817) It is, therefore, an intensely active, purifying, inward force.
('36', 340, 1, 11, 669881) It is often antagonistic to the material good of the non resister.
('36', 340, 1, 12, 669948) It may even mean his utter material ruin.
('36', 340, 1, 13, 669990) It is rooted in internal strength, never weakness.
('36', 340, 1, 14, 670041) It must be consciously exercised.
('36', 340, 1, 15, 670075) It, therefore, presupposes ability to offer physical resistance.
('36', 340, 1, 16, 670140) In the last instance, therefore, the Japanese would have non resisted, if they had left all their possessions rather than surrendered the rights of prospective immigrants.
('36', 340, 1, 17, 670312) They might also have suffered death [by] lynching without even mental retaliation and thus melted the hearts of their persecutors.
('36', 340, 1, 18, 670443) It was no victory of truth that, without any inconvenience to themselves, they were able to retain their property.
('36', 340, 1, 19, 670558) In terms of non resistance, their contribution to the American church in its difficulty was a bribe, by no means a token of goodwill or a free gift.
('36', 340, 1, 20, 670707) The acquisition of the spirit of non resistance is a matter of long training in self denial and appreciation of the hidden forces within ourselves.
('36', 340, 1, 21, 670855) It changes one’s outlook upon life.
('36', 340, 1, 22, 670891) It puts different values upon things and upsets previous calculations.
('36', 340, 1, 23, 670962) And when once it is set in motion, its effect, if it is intensive enough, can overtake the whole universe.
('36', 340, 1, 24, 671069) It is the greatest force because it is the highest expression of the soul.
('36', 340, 1, 25, 671144) All need not possess the same measure of conscious non resistance for its full operation.
('36', 340, 1, 26, 671234) It is enough for one person only to possess it, even as one general is enough to regulate and dispose of the energy of millions of soldiers who enlist under his banner though they know not the why and wherefore of his dispositions.
('36', 340, 1, 27, 671466) The monkeys of one Rama were enough to confound the innumerable host armed from head to foot of the ten headed Ravana.

('36', 341, 1, 2, 671650) 388. NO FAITH IN PRAYER
('36', 341, 2, 3, 671674) Here is a letter written by a student to the Principal of a national institution asking to be excused from attending its prayer meetings:
('36', 341, 3, 4, 671812) I beg to state that I have no belief in prayer, as I do not believe in anything known as God to whom I should pray.
('36', 341, 3, 5, 671928) I never feel any necessity of supposing a god for myself.
('36', 341, 3, 6, 671986) What do I lose if I do not care for Him and calmly and sincerely work my own schemes?
('36', 341, 4, 7, 672072) So far as congregational prayer is concerned, it is of no use.
('36', 341, 4, 8, 672135) Can such a huge mass of men enter, into any mental concentration upon a thing, however trifling it may be?
('36', 341, 4, 9, 672242) Are the little and ignorant children, expected to fix their fickle attention on the subtlest ideas of our great scriptures, God and soul and equality of all men and many other high sounding phrases?
('36', 341, 4, 10, 672441) This great performance is required to be done at a particular time at the command of a particular man.
('36', 341, 4, 11, 672544) Can love for the so called Lord take its root in the hearts of boys by any such mechanical function?
('36', 341, 4, 12, 672645) Nothing can be more repugnant to reason than to expect the same behaviour from men of every temperament.
('36', 341, 4, 13, 672750) Therefore, prayer should not be a compulsion.
('36', 341, 4, 14, 672796) Let those pray who have a taste for it and those avoid who dislike it.
('36', 341, 4, 15, 672867) Anything done without conviction is an immoral and degrading action.
('36', 341, 4, 16, 672936) Let us first examine the worth of the last idea.
('36', 341, 4, 17, 672985) Is it an immoral and degrading act to submit to discipline before one begins to have conviction about its necessity?
('36', 341, 4, 18, 673102) Is it immoral and degrading to study subjects according to the school syllabus if one has no conviction about its utility?
('36', 341, 4, 19, 673225) May a boy be excused from studying his vernacular if he has persuaded himself that it is useless?
('36', 341, 4, 20, 673323) Is it not truer to say that a school boy has no conviction about the things he has to learn or the discipline he has to go through?
('36', 341, 4, 21, 673455) His choice is exhausted if he had it, when he elected to belong to an institution.
('36', 341, 4, 22, 673538) His joining one means that he will willingly submit to its rules and regulations.
('36', 341, 4, 23, 673620) It is open to hint to leave it, but he may not choose what or how he will learn.
('36', 341, 5, 24, 673701) It is for teachers to make attractive and intelligible what to the pupils may at first appear repulsive or uninteresting.
('36', 341, 6, 25, 673823) It is easy enough to say, ‘I do not believe in God.’ For God permits all things to be said of Him with impunity.
('36', 341, 6, 26, 673936) He looks at our acts.
('36', 341, 6, 27, 673958) And any breach of His law carried with it, not its vindictive, but its purifying, compelling, punishment.
('36', 341, 6, 28, 674064) God’s existence cannot be, does not need to be, proved.
('36', 341, 6, 29, 674120) God is.
('36', 341, 6, 30, 674128) If He is not felt, so much the worse for us.
('36', 341, 6, 31, 674173) The absence of feeling is a disease which we shall some

('36', 342, 1, 2, 674274) day throw off nolens volens.
('36', 342, 1, 3, 674303) But a boy may not argue.
('36', 342, 1, 4, 674328) He must, out of a sense of discipline, attend prayer meetings if the institution to which he belongs requires such attendance.
('36', 342, 1, 5, 674455) He may respectfully put his doubts before his teachers.
('36', 342, 1, 6, 674511) He need not believe what does not appeal to him.
('36', 342, 1, 7, 674560) But if he has respect for his teachers, he will do without believing what he is asked to do, not out of fear, not out of churlishness, but with the knowledge that it is right for him so to do and with the hope that what is dark to him today will some day be made clear to him.
('36', 342, 1, 8, 674837) Prayer is not an asking.
('36', 342, 1, 9, 674862) It is a longing of the soul.
('36', 342, 1, 10, 674891) It is a daily admission of one’s weakness.
('36', 342, 1, 11, 674934) The tallest among us has a perpetual reminder of his nothingness before death, disease, old age, accidents, etc.
('36', 342, 1, 12, 675047) We are living in the midst of death.
('36', 342, 1, 13, 675084) What is the value of”working for our own schemes” when they might be reduced to naught in the twinkling of an eye, or when we may be equally swiftly and unawares be taken away from them?
('36', 342, 1, 14, 675271) But we may feel strong as a rock, if we could truthfully say:”We work for God and His schemes.” Then all is as clear as daylight.
('36', 342, 1, 15, 675401) Then nothing perishes.
('36', 342, 1, 16, 675424) All perishing is then only what seems.
('36', 342, 1, 17, 675463) Death and destruction have then, but only then, no reality about them.
('36', 342, 1, 18, 675534) For death or destruction is then but a change.
('36', 342, 1, 19, 675581) An artist destroys his picture for creating a better one.
('36', 342, 1, 20, 675639) A watch maker throws away a bad spring to put in a new and useful one.
('36', 342, 1, 21, 675710) A congregational prayer is a mighty thing.
('36', 342, 1, 22, 675753) What we do not often do alone, we do together.
('36', 342, 1, 23, 675800) Boys do not need conviction.
('36', 342, 1, 24, 675829) If they merely attend in obedience to the call to prayer without inward resistance, they feel the exaltation.
('36', 342, 1, 25, 675939) But many do not.
('36', 342, 1, 26, 675956) They are even mischievous.
('36', 342, 1, 27, 675983) All the same the unconscious effect cannot be resisted.
('36', 342, 1, 28, 676039) Are there not boys who at the commencement of their career were scoffers but who subsequently became mighty believers in the efficacy of congrega tional prayer?
('36', 342, 1, 29, 676200) It is a common experience for men who have no robust faith to seek the comfort of congregational prayer.
('36', 342, 1, 30, 676305) All who flock to churches, temples, or mosques are not scoffers or humbugs.
('36', 342, 1, 31, 676381) They are honest men and women.
('36', 342, 1, 32, 676412) For them congregational prayer is like a daily bath, a necessity, of their existence.
('36', 342, 1, 33, 676498) These places of worship are not a mere idle superstition to be swept away at the first opportunity.
('36', 342, 1, 34, 676598) They have survived all attacks up to now and are likely to persist to the end of time.

('36', 343, 1, 2, 676750) 389. RELIGION OF VOLUNTEERS
('36', 343, 2, 3, 676778) After showing that in this land of many religions, a volunteer is hard put to it to find a common denominator of conduct, a correspondent thus eloquently described the religion of a volunteer: 1
('36', 343, 3, 4, 676973) Stripped of the eloquence, this religion of Truth again resolves itself into its component parts—Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, etc.
('36', 343, 3, 5, 677106) For Truth will appear to most sincere and conscientious Hindus, Mussalmans and Christians as Hinduism, Islam and Christianity, respectively, as they believe them.
('36', 343, 3, 6, 677269) The golden rule of conduct, therefore, is mutual toleration seeing that we will never all think alike and that we shall always see Truth in fragment and from different angles of vision.
('36', 343, 3, 7, 677455) Conscience is not the same thing for all.
('36', 343, 3, 8, 677497) Whilst, therefore, it is a good guide for individual conduct, imposition of that conduct upon all will be an insufferable interference with everybody else’s freedom of conscience.
('36', 343, 3, 9, 677677) It is a much abused term.
('36', 343, 3, 10, 677703) Have all people a conscience?
('36', 343, 3, 11, 677733) Has a cannibal a conscience?
('36', 343, 3, 12, 677762) Must he be allowed to act according to the dictates of his conscience which tells him that it is his duty to kill and eat his fellows?
('36', 343, 3, 13, 677897) Now the etymological meaning of conscience is ‘true knowledge’.
('36', 343, 3, 14, 677961) The dictionary meaning is ‘faculty distinguishing between right and wrong and influencing conduct accordingly’.
('36', 343, 3, 15, 678073) Possession of such a faculty is possible only for a trained person, that is, one who has undergone discipline and learnt to listen to the inner voice.
('36', 343, 3, 16, 678224) But even amongst the most conscientious persons, there will be room enough for honest differences of opinion.
('36', 343, 3, 17, 678334) The only possible rule of conduct in any civilized society is therefore mutual toleration.
('36', 343, 3, 18, 678425) It can be inculcated among and practised by all irrespective of their status and training.

('36', 344, 4, 6, 679202) I appreciate the anxiety of Pandit Benarsidas 1 to save the unfortunate people from another disappointment by those who were domiciled in Fiji being sent to British Guiana.
('36', 344, 4, 7, 679375) Though the difference between the two countries is great, the experiment is worth trying if the Fiji men desire to go on British Guiana and if that Government will take them notwithstanding the knowledge that they belong to Fiji.
('36', 344, 4, 8, 679605) So far as the Colonial borns are concerned, I feel sure that though they may have a knowledge of what is known as kitchen Hindustani, they will not be happy except in the Colonies.
('36', 344, 4, 9, 679786) The vital issues referred to by Pandit Benarsidas must be dealt with later.

('36', 344, 11, 18, 680505) The writer’s thesis was that the feeling of”I” and”mine” was responsible for much of the communal intolerance and violence in the country, and that, indeed, a true understanding of all religions was possible only through regard for the universal virtues, Truth, Non violence, etc.

('36', 345, 2, 3, 680839) TO B, AGRA
('36', 345, 3, 4, 680850) I fix arbitrary limit nor do I restrict myself to hard and fast conditions.
('36', 345, 3, 5, 680926) The widows should have the same freedom that men have.
('36', 345, 3, 6, 680981) If widowhood is to remain pure, men will have to attain greater purity.
('36', 345, 3, 7, 681053) After all widows can remarry only when there are men ready to marry them.
('36', 345, 3, 8, 681127) It may, however, be laid down as a general rule that where a widow cannot restrain herself, she should have the freedom to remarry without incurring any odium.
('36', 345, 3, 9, 681287) Is it not better that she marries openly than that she should sin secretly?
('36', 345, 3, 10, 681363) In the case of child widows there can be no question of opinion.
('36', 345, 3, 11, 681428) They should be remarried by the parents.
('36', 345, 3, 12, 681469) If the wives and widows in the fourth division are no better than beasts, which I totally deny and I claim to know something of them, the fault lies at the door of the so called higher classes.
('36', 345, 3, 13, 681663) You seem to forget the law that if one limb suffers, the whole body suffers.
('36', 345, 3, 14, 681740) If one Sudra does evil, it harms the whole society, even as it harms himself and his special class or caste.

('36', 345, 5, 18, 682054) The extracts are valuable as showing what harm the disappearance of hand spinning has brought to the villagers.
('36', 345, 5, 19, 682166) There is no reason why the mischief should not be undone, if only we get sufficient workers to strive for the revival of the industry: 1

('36', 346, 7, 18, 683722) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('36', 346, 7, 19, 683755) I had not seen Mirabehn’s letter to you.
('36', 346, 7, 20, 683796) Evidently my words carried a meaning to her which I had not mended.
('36', 346, 7, 21, 683864) I did not want her to write in my name and on my behalf.
('36', 346, 7, 22, 683921) But interpreting my remarks in the manner she did, she was of course quite right in writing to you in my name.
('36', 346, 7, 23, 684032) She has read to me her letter
('36', 346, 8, 24, 684062) 1 Presumably, Mridula Sarabhai, daughter of Ambalal Sarabhai the Ahmedabad millowner 2 Andrews sailed for South Africa on September 29. The letter appears to have been written on the preceding Thursday, which was September 23.

('36', 347, 1, 2, 684331) to you.
('36', 347, 1, 3, 684339) 1 had not got from that letter that she said anything that might lead you to think that I was displeased.
('36', 347, 1, 4, 684445) As a matter of fact, I am not inclined to quarrel with your preface even now and after your explanation and after your having recognized your own attitude.
('36', 347, 1, 5, 684601) In my opinion a publisher has every right in publishing certainly writings and dissent[ing] partly or wholly from the views expressed by the author or to tone them down.
('36', 347, 1, 6, 684771) You know much better than I do what the European reader will approve of or can assimilate.
('36', 347, 1, 7, 684862) You have, therefore, a perfect right to tone down my remarks.
('36', 347, 1, 8, 684924) I myself recognize the defects from a scientific point of view of the Guide to Health.
('36', 347, 1, 9, 685011) In its translated form, I have never read it through.
('36', 347, 1, 10, 685065) The information given in it about physiological facts is undoubtedly borrowed.
('36', 347, 1, 11, 685144) The only value of the book consists in subordinating health or the body to that of the spirit within.
('36', 347, 1, 12, 685246) When I wrote the chapters, I wrote them purely for the Gujarati readers of the Indian Opinion.
('36', 347, 1, 13, 685341) I give you my assurance, therefore, that there was no question of my being displeased at all.
('36', 347, 1, 14, 685435) One thing certainly I did not like.
('36', 347, 1, 15, 685471) Mis translations and omissions of portions in the original.
('36', 347, 1, 16, 685531) That I hold is unpardonable.
('36', 347, 1, 17, 685560) A publisher should publish the whole of an author’s writings unless he has the author’s permission to delete passages and unless the publisher has informed the author of deletions.
('36', 347, 1, 18, 685741) You will please, therefore, dismiss from your mind the slightest suspicion that I was either displeased or angry about anything you have done in connection with the publication of my writings.

('36', 347, 3, 23, 686117) 1 I shan’t hastily advise the council to do away with the Andhra agency.
('36', 347, 3, 24, 686190) But I have felt that both you and Seetharama
('36', 347, 4, 25, 686235) 1 Writing on September 18, Venkatappayya had deplored the possibility of having to close down of khadi agency at Guntur, as suggested by Gandhiji to Sitarama Sastri and given the assurance that by personal efforts and supervision they would ensure better conditions (S.N. 11238).

('36', 348, 1, 2, 686560) Shastri are too soft hearted.
('36', 348, 1, 3, 686590) My own opinion is that softness and ahimsa go ill together.
('36', 348, 1, 4, 686650) You have to be sometimes hard in order to be really and truly kind.
('36', 348, 1, 5, 686718) But in Andhra, I have been watching with the greatest pain the indiscipline practised under the name of liberty and unprincipled men getting the upper hand and doing what they like with impunity.
('36', 348, 1, 6, 686914) Not that these things have not happened elsewhere.
('36', 348, 1, 7, 686965) But in Andhra, perhaps, the evil has been moreaccentuated.
('36', 348, 1, 8, 687024) Khadi can succeed today if we can get disciplined men with boundless faith in it and with no other irons in the fire.
('36', 348, 1, 9, 687142) If you think that you and Seetharama Shastri have that absolute faith in khadi and if you think that you can be hard enough when occasion requires hardness, by all means continue the agency.
('36', 348, 1, 10, 687333) But let there be no further experimenting in dilatoriness and compromising and pleading [with] people.
('36', 348, 1, 11, 687436) The agency may be conducted on a business like footing.
('36', 348, 1, 12, 687492) And if you think that it is worth while coming here to discuss the whole situation, by all means do come and bring Seetharama Shastri and anybody else you like.
('36', 348, 1, 13, 687653) I hope your health is all right and that you have got over your domestic worries.

('36', 348, 6, 19, 687915) I actually wrote something for you and then destroyed it feeling that I was not doing justice to you.
('36', 348, 6, 20, 688017) That is to say, instead of striving with you, I was yielding to your wish so as to avoid trouble.
('36', 348, 6, 21, 688115) What I want to tell you is that you need not lead an organ to carry on temperance work.
('36', 348, 6, 22, 688203) If you have sincere helpers, their time and your time will be a comparative waste.
('36', 348, 6, 23, 688286) I have worked among drunkards both in South Africa and here.
('36', 348, 6, 24, 688347) Do you know that you never reach them through writing?
('36', 348, 6, 25, 688402) They are past reading anything, they are past being influenced by anything they read.
('36', 348, 6, 26, 688488) It is the personal touch that wins them from drink if anything does at all.

('36', 349, 1, 3, 688757) I want to do likewise with you, even if I cannot dissuade you from embarking on your enterprise.
('36', 349, 1, 4, 688854) You might be too much committed to retrace your steps or you might hold diametrically opposite views as to the method of carrying on temperance work.
('36', 349, 1, 5, 689004) I am unable to condemn such thought and action based thereon, only I would then like to have my way and if possible have it appreciated.

('36', 350, 3, 4, 689871) SABARMATI,
('36', 350, 4, 5, 689882) Friday, Bhadra Vad 3 [September 24, 1926] 1
('36', 350, 5, 6, 689926) BHAISHRI LAKSHMIDAS, I have to reply to two letters from you, one about the boycott of British goods and the other concerning the deputation from South Africa.
('36', 350, 5, 7, 690086) On reading the pamphlet about boycott, [I feel that] you have written it with a courage worthy of you.
('36', 350, 5, 8, 690189) But I have not been impressed by your argument.
('36', 350, 5, 9, 690237) I may not, on principle, agree with the idea of boycotting British goods, but I would certainly understand it if it was feasible and of benefit from a practical point of view.
('36', 350, 5, 10, 690413) You have not been able to prove either its feasibility or its practical utility.
('36', 350, 5, 11, 690494) On the contrary, after reading your pamphlet I feel that the boycott of British goods will be of no benefit even from the practical point of view.
('36', 350, 5, 12, 690641) I am sure you will not want me to go into reasons.
('36', 350, 5, 13, 690692) From you I would expect suggestions which are practicable.
('36', 350, 5, 14, 690751) You are intelligent and would not, I believe, strike a blow which would fail in its aim.
('36', 350, 5, 15, 690840) This blow which you have struck, I am afraid, has certainly failed in its aim.
('36', 350, 5, 16, 690919) We or the people wanted representatives from South Africa to visit this country.
('36', 350, 5, 17, 691000) The Indian residents in South Africa also wanted that we should extend a welcome even to an enemy if we have invited him to our tent.
('36', 350, 5, 18, 691134) The Conference 2 has been arranged because of the agitation here, and these gentlemen are here in connection with it.
('36', 350, 5, 19, 691252) It is our clear duty to extend a welcome to them.
('36', 350, 5, 20, 691302) By doing so, we strengthen our position so that we should be able to tell them what we feel about their laws.
('36', 350, 5, 21, 691412) We cannot refuse to have anything to do with them by arguing that they have been invited here only by the Government and that we have nothing to do in the matter.
('36', 350, 5, 22, 691575) We can certainly advance such an argument against anything done in defiance of public opinion.
('36', 350, 5, 23, 691670) I was, therefore, surprised to read your letter.
('36', 350, 6, 24, 691719) 1 Reference in the letter to the delegation from South Africa indicates that the letter was written in 1926. 2 The Round Table Conference on the Indian question in South Africa held at Cape from December 17, 1926 to January 13, 1927

('36', 353, 13, 20, 695325) A voluntary spinner writes as follows: 3
('36', 353, 14, 21, 695366) This is a reasonable request.
('36', 353, 14, 22, 695396) It is not necessary for the Spinners’ Association to start a new journal for the purpose; but the difficulties of the kind mentioned by the spinner could be solved through

('36', 353, 15, 24, 695624) 2. From the postmark 3 The letter is not translated here.
('36', 353, 15, 25, 695682) The correspondent had suggested that the All India Spinners’ Association should maintain contacts with spinners and help them to solve their problems.

('36', 354, 1, 2, 695878) Navajivan and Young India.
('36', 354, 1, 3, 695905) Whoever experiences any difficulties in spinning or wishes to ask any questions concerning it may certainly write; his questions will be answered in Navajivan.
('36', 354, 1, 4, 696065) The trouble is that the spinners do nothing to get their problems solved and do not write to me either because of their laziness or indifference or, sometimes, for fear lest they should add to my burden.
('36', 354, 1, 5, 696269) A sacrificial spinner cannot afford to be either lazy or careless.
('36', 354, 1, 6, 696336) To be concerned for me is to do injustice both to me and to this movement.
('36', 354, 1, 7, 696411) I can easily request others to solve problems which I cannot solve myself.
('36', 354, 1, 8, 696486) Anyone, therefore, who has problems may write without the slightest hesitation, only remembering one condition, namely, that the letters should be written in ink and the correspondent should explain his problem briefly and in legible handwriting, and without argument.
('36', 354, 1, 9, 696755) It will be easier for me if the envelope bears the words”About Spinning”.
('36', 354, 1, 10, 696829) Now the letter given above has raised one problem which can be solved here.
('36', 354, 1, 11, 696905) Blowing water spray is intended to moisten every thread on the hank.
('36', 354, 1, 12, 696974) This process is essential for increasing the strength of the yarn.
('36', 354, 1, 13, 697041) It has been found to do so to the extent of 20 per cent.
('36', 354, 1, 14, 697098) No one, therefore, should remove the yarn from the real without first blowing water spray on it.
('36', 354, 1, 15, 697195) The easiest and the best method of serving the aim behind blowing is to keep the reel immersed in water for three to five minutes and move the hand over it to, moisten it.
('36', 354, 1, 16, 697367) This will moisten every part of the thread to the right degree.
('36', 354, 1, 17, 697431) The reel will last longer if it is made wholly of wood, instead of having strings round it.
('36', 354, 1, 18, 697523) The cotton strings used for this purpose will get soiled and then wear out if the reel is immersed in water frequently.
('36', 354, 1, 19, 697643) If the yarn is not removed from the reel soon after immersing the latter into water but left on it for twelve hours, every coil on the reel would suck in moisture.
('36', 354, 1, 20, 697807) Our purpose would be served better if the yarn is carefully spread out on the reel before the latter is immersed into water.
('36', 354, 1, 21, 697932) Moving the hand on the yarn after immersing the reel in water will moisten the yarn more quickly.

('36', 355, 2, 3, 698140) A teacher writes: 1
('36', 355, 3, 4, 698160) Everyone will admit that there is much truth in what the writer says.
('36', 355, 3, 5, 698230) The point does not need to be laboured that after one’s children are grown up, if one continues to have children from the same wife or if she is dead, from a second wife, it produces a bad effect on the minds of the older children.
('36', 355, 3, 6, 698462) But if it is not possible for him to practise self control, a father should lodge his older children in a separate establishment, or should himself live in a separate room, so that they will not have any opportunity of seeing or hearing anything.
('36', 355, 3, 7, 698709) This will at least ensure a certain degree of decency.
('36', 355, 3, 8, 698764) Though childhood should be lived in innocence, parents fond of pleasure corrupt the minds of their children.
('36', 355, 3, 9, 698873) The practice of vanaprasthashrama is good for develop ing a sense of morality in children and for making them freedom loving and self reliant.
('36', 355, 4, 10, 699016) The suggestion which the writer has made to teachers is certainly sound.
('36', 355, 4, 11, 699089) But where there are forty to fifty children in a class and the relationship of the teacher with the pupils is confined to class work lessons, how will it be possible for the teacher, even if he so wishes, to establish any spiritual relationship with so many children?
('36', 355, 4, 12, 699357) Again, when six or seven teachers teach six or seven different subjects, which of them can assume the responsibility to give them moral instruction?
('36', 355, 5, 13, 699506) Lastly, how many teachers can we come across who will guide the children along the path of morality or win their confidence?
('36', 355, 5, 14, 699631) This indeed raises the whole question of education, but it cannot be discussed here.
('36', 355, 5, 15, 699716) Society moves forward like a flock of sheep without thought or circumspection and some even consider that to be progress.
('36', 355, 5, 16, 699838) But despite this awful state of affairs, our individual path is clear.
('36', 355, 5, 17, 699909) Those who know own it to themselves to create and spread an atmosphere of morality in their own field of work.
('36', 355, 5, 18, 700020) To begin with, they must first bring about improvement in themselves.
('36', 355, 5, 19, 700090) When we consider the faults of others, we appear to be very virtuous.
('36', 355, 5, 20, 700160) But if we direct our attention to drawbacks, we shall find that we are crafty and lascivious.
('36', 355, 5, 21, 700254) It is far
('36', 355, 6, 22, 700264) 1 The letter is not translated here.
('36', 355, 6, 23, 700301) The correspondent had deplored parents of grown up boys and girls continuing to have children and had suggested that teachers should make friends with pupils individually and inculcate in them respect for morality.
('36', 356, 0, 1, 700516) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 357
('36', 356, 1, 2, 700561) more profitable to sit in judgment on ourselves than on others and while doing so, we find out ways for others.
('36', 356, 1, 3, 700673) This is one meaning among others of the adage,”If you are good, the world is good.” Tulsidas has likened the saint to the philosopher’s stone.
('36', 356, 1, 4, 700816) The simile is not wrong.
('36', 356, 1, 5, 700841) We must all try to be saints.
('36', 356, 1, 6, 700871) To be that is not a gift from the skies for an extraordinary man, but is the bounden duty of every man and that indeed is the essence of life.

('36', 356, 11, 20, 701513) If you do join the Ashram, it will still have to be on probation in the first instance.
('36', 356, 11, 21, 701601) And even as a probationer, you have to take certain vows that is, truth, non violence, poverty, i.e., non possession, brahmacharyam, etc.
('36', 356, 11, 22, 701739) They become final at the end of the probation.

('36', 357, 5, 11, 702695) TAPPERS’ ASSOCIATION
('36', 357, 6, 12, 702716) A correspondent sends me the following report of the formation of a Tappers’ Association in Cochin: 1
('36', 357, 7, 13, 702818) Travancore and Cochin are palm groves.
('36', 357, 7, 14, 702857) Tapping is a big industry in these States.
('36', 357, 7, 15, 702900) But tapping, instead of being used for health giving purposes, is abused for promoting the destruction of health and morals.
('36', 357, 7, 16, 703025) For, the toddy tapped is fermented and sold as drink.
('36', 357, 7, 17, 703079) This reminds one of the use that is made of vineyards in Europe and South Africa.
('36', 357, 7, 18, 703161) There is no fruit save oranges to match grapes in its health giving properties.
('36', 357, 7, 19, 703241) A person who would live on fresh grapes and a little fatless bread need never get ill.
('36', 357, 7, 20, 703328) But the grape culture supports a manufacture that destroys annually more people than gunpowder.
('36', 357, 7, 21, 703424) What fruitarians are nevertheless trying to do, with no present prospect, but with faith in the truth of their mission, the Tappers, Association may do in Cochin if it works without being dismayed by disappointments.
('36', 357, 7, 22, 703641) It is a splendid idea to turn toddy into jaggery.
('36', 357, 7, 23, 703691) If it succeeds, it will solve the problem of occupying tappers when temperance becomes the rule of life in the land of palms.
('36', 357, 7, 24, 703817) It is painful to find that in a Brahmin ruled State, which has the reputation of being called enlightened, instead of facilities being given there
('36', 357, 8, 25, 703964) 1 At a meeting of tappers held at Kunnamkulam, an association was formed with membership restricted to those who tapped for sweet toddy for manufacturing jaggery.
('36', 357, 8, 26, 704127) Some 102 tappers took the vow that they would not tap for fermented toddy.
('36', 357, 8, 27, 704202) The object of the Association was to work for the moral and social improvement of the tappers in Cochin State.
('36', 358, 0, 1, 704313) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 359
('36', 358, 1, 2, 704358) should be vexatious rules imposed upon those who would tap for manufacturing jaggery.
('36', 358, 2, 3, 704444) PIVOT OF EDUCATION
('36', 358, 3, 4, 704463) At a time when emphasis in education is put more upon literary knowledge than upon character building, the following from the article of Principal Jacks in the Sunday School Chronicle will be read with profit: 1
('36', 358, 4, 5, 704675) IN FAR OFF TUTICORIN
('36', 358, 5, 6, 704696) K. Nalla Sivan Pillai writes: 2
('36', 358, 6, 7, 704728) My best wishes will not avail the Swadesa Balyam Sangam if the members do not do their duty by it.
('36', 358, 6, 8, 704827) The inaccuracy of the language of the latter is disturbing.
('36', 358, 6, 9, 704887) Why should there be an”about” in giving information about a small society?
('36', 358, 6, 10, 704962) Instead of saying”most of them spin”, the correspondent could have given the exact number of spinners, the time given by each daily to spinning and the count and the quantity spun.
('36', 358, 6, 11, 705143) Why”there are about 20 charkhas” and why not exactly how many?
('36', 358, 6, 12, 705206) Why”some paid spinners”?
('36', 358, 6, 13, 705231) Why not quite how many?
('36', 358, 6, 14, 705255) Why no mention of the wage given?
('36', 358, 6, 15, 705289) Are they spinners in need?
('36', 358, 6, 16, 705316) What is the meaning of”about 60 towels”?
('36', 358, 6, 17, 705357) 60 is a round number.
('36', 358, 6, 18, 705379) A business like organization should give business like information.
('36', 358, 6, 19, 705447) And those who wish to do khaddar work, i.e., serve the poorest and the neediest, must be business like.
('36', 358, 6, 20, 705551) An association of exactly 20 members or even 13 would be a good and lucky association and will be a valuable nucleus for khaddar propaganda on a large scale, if all the 20 or 13 are honest, self sacrificing, earnest and industrious plodding workers.
('36', 358, 6, 21, 705801) Khaddar work cannot be done by fits and starts.
('36', 358, 6, 22, 705849) It cannot be done by impulsive men who would slave for a few days, maybe a few months, and then collapse altogether.
('36', 358, 6, 23, 705966) Determination and grit are absolute essentials of success in this great national movement.
('36', 358, 7, 24, 706057) 1 The extract, not reproduced here, dwelt on failure, in the march of science, to solve the problem of its correct application, and emphasized the need for”all the enterprise of education and all the activities of religion” to reach”their focus—the point of responsibility”.
('36', 358, 7, 25, 706332) 2 Here followed a factual report of the activities of the Swadesa Balyam Sangam of Tuticorin, not reproduced here.

('36', 359, 1, 2, 706489) ALL INDIA SPINNERS’ ASSOCIATION
('36', 359, 2, 3, 706521) The A. I. S. A. finishes the first year of its existence at the end of the month.
('36', 359, 2, 4, 706603) Those who are in arrears for the passing year should make up their quota, if they wish to be considered continuing members of the A.I.S.A. Those who wish to renew their subscription for the next year should hasten to send in their quota.
('36', 359, 2, 5, 706841) Too much stress cannot be placed upon the necessity of sending well twisted, even and sprayed yarn.
('36', 359, 2, 6, 706941) The testers have tested the yarn sent in an indulgent way.
('36', 359, 2, 7, 707000) But indulgence cannot be continued for ever.
('36', 359, 2, 8, 707045) It would be had for the spinners and bad for the nation.
('36', 359, 2, 9, 707102) Spinners therefore need not be surprised if they find that bad yarn is henceforth rejected, as bad coin, or for that matter everything bad, is or must be rejected.
('36', 359, 2, 10, 707266) Let the members remember that for receiving the privileges of the constitution to be revised at the end of five years of existence of theas sociation, it will be necessary to show five years’ continuing membership.
('36', 359, 3, 11, 707481) “TAKLI” IN SCHOOLS
('36', 359, 4, 12, 707500) Babu Prafulla Ch. Sen has sent to the All India Spinners’ Association an accurate and detailed report of the results of one month’s takli spinning in the Duadando National School (Bengal) which he has just taken over.
('36', 359, 4, 13, 707718) The names, the times, and the yards spun, and the average speed for everybody are given in the table sent by him.
('36', 359, 4, 14, 707832) Twenty six boys spun during the month of August 14,368 yards, in weight 56 tolas, of from six to 30 counts.
('36', 359, 4, 15, 707940) Nearly 50 per cent of the yarn was fit for warp.
('36', 359, 4, 16, 707989) The highest average speed attained was 90 yards per hour.
('36', 359, 4, 17, 708047) The highest time spun by a boy was 18 hours during the month.
('36', 359, 4, 18, 708109) The highest quantity was 1,621 yards.
('36', 359, 4, 19, 708147) Only four boys spun 1,000 yards or over and thus qualified themselves in one month to become members of the juvenile branch of the Association, i.e., if they were also wearing khaddar.
('36', 359, 4, 20, 708332) If the teachers and the boys persist, there is no reason why at the end of the year every boy should not spin enough for his own clothing.
('36', 359, 4, 21, 708471) I take it that the boys will in due course be taught to card their own cotton, if they are not already doing so.
('36', 359, 4, 22, 708584) Prafulla Babu supplements the table with the following interesting letter: 1
('36', 359, 5, 23, 708661) Young India, 30 9 1926
('36', 359, 6, 24, 708684) 1 Not reproduced here.
('36', 359, 6, 25, 708707) It described the happy results of a change over from inefficient spinning wheels to the taklis which the pupils took up with avidity.

('36', 360, 2, 3, 708901) That restless great soul, Charlie Andrews, is never so happy as when he is wandering in search of God, i.e., humane service.
('36', 360, 2, 4, 709026) Illness does not baffle him.
('36', 360, 2, 5, 709055) If it is labour in distress, Charlie Andrews rushes to the rescue.
('36', 360, 2, 6, 709122) If it is the flood stricken that need his assistance, he goes, fever or no fever.
('36', 360, 2, 7, 709204) Indians overseas find in him an ever ready helper and an unfailing guide.
('36', 360, 2, 8, 709278) He was not well.
('36', 360, 2, 9, 709295) He had a bite from a poisonous insect when he was at Stokes’s farm.
('36', 360, 2, 10, 709363) But he would not take full rest as Shantiniketan needed him.
('36', 360, 2, 11, 709424) He came to Sabarmati before proceeding to South Africa.
('36', 360, 2, 12, 709480) He was not well.
('36', 360, 2, 13, 709497) He got worse.
('36', 360, 2, 14, 709511) But he will not cancelhis passage.
('36', 360, 2, 15, 709546) He was better, having rested under the hospitable roof of Sjt.
('36', 360, 2, 16, 709609) Ambalal Sarabhai.
('36', 360, 2, 17, 709627) And now, though he is not strong enough, he is on his way to South Africa.
('36', 360, 2, 18, 709702) Before leaving, he left a writing which the reader will find in another column.
('36', 360, 2, 19, 709782) For him this work of love is a search for God.
('36', 360, 2, 20, 709829) It is God’s call to which he has responded.
('36', 360, 2, 21, 709873) He knows that he may get nothing.
('36', 360, 2, 22, 709907) But his is”not to reason why”; his is”but to do and die”.
('36', 360, 2, 23, 709965) It is enough for him that the Indians of South Africa want him and that they have a just cause.
('36', 360, 2, 24, 710061) He does not stop to weigh whether the cause is big or small.
('36', 360, 2, 25, 710122) For him nothing is too small that is just and truthful.
('36', 360, 2, 26, 710178) No individual is too lowly, if he needs his service.
('36', 360, 2, 27, 710231) The Brahmin and the Bhangi, the prince and the peasant, the capitalist and the labourers claim his equal attention, if they stand for truth and justice.
('36', 360, 2, 28, 710384) He is sensitive.
('36', 360, 2, 29, 710401) He feels the criticism gently conveyed to him by well meaning friends that he should have been in India whilst the Union Deputation was here and the India settlers would not need him so long before the time of the Round Table Conference.
('36', 360, 2, 30, 710639) He has allowed himself just to answer the criticism in his”In Search of God” 1. He was not wanted by the Deputation.
('36', 360, 2, 31, 710756) Its hands are full.
('36', 360, 2, 32, 710776) As a matter of fact, the Deputation does want not to be coached.
('36', 360, 2, 33, 710841) It does not
('36', 360, 3, 34, 710853) 1 The correct title of the article by Andrews is”The Search for God”.
('36', 360, 3, 35, 710923) He wrote of his impending journey to South Africa:”There have been many voices of discouragement of late, stating—what seems almost evident on the surface—that journeys to South Africa are useless, while the colour bar remains so firmly established; while the daily treatment of Indians in the streets, in the railway trains and in constant social ways, marks them out as an inferior and subject race.
('36', 360, 3, 36, 711325) All this I know full well from a bitter and intimate experience.
('36', 360, 3, 37, 711390) Nevertheless, in face of an Asiatic Bill, which has only been suspended, not withdrawn, I have confidence and hope.
('36', 360, 3, 38, 711506) For God is there, keeping His high Festival in human hearts, quickening love in them among the Dutch and English, even as He is doing here among ourselves; and surely He will meet me there as the companion.
('36', 361, 0, 1, 711713) 362 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 361, 1, 2, 711755) want to collect evidence officially.
('36', 361, 1, 3, 711792) It has come to gather impressions without being told.
('36', 361, 1, 4, 711846) It is enough if the members have come with an open mind.
('36', 361, 1, 5, 711903) We have no reason to think otherwise.
('36', 361, 1, 6, 711941) They must be left undisturbed save by their own consciences.
('36', 361, 1, 7, 712002) And conscience acts best when unprompted.
('36', 361, 1, 8, 712044) It is put upon its mettle.
('36', 361, 1, 9, 712071) Mr. Andrews is wanted in south Africa and that now.
('36', 361, 1, 10, 712123) Because the settlers immediately need a helper.
('36', 361, 1, 11, 712171) Reuter has told us they were in consternation when they heard of his illness.
('36', 361, 1, 12, 712249) He is their chief, if not their only hope.
('36', 361, 1, 13, 712292) They must prepare their case.
('36', 361, 1, 14, 712322) They needall the time that is now left for that preparation.
('36', 361, 1, 15, 712383) They need him for this.
('36', 361, 1, 16, 712407) He must prepare the atmosphere that is required for the Conference.
('36', 361, 1, 17, 712475) He is the only living link between the whites and the Indians.
('36', 361, 1, 18, 712538) The Conference can do nothing, if South African public opinion is intensely hostile to Indians.
('36', 361, 1, 19, 712634) South African public opinion is not like ours.
('36', 361, 1, 20, 712681) It has force behind it.
('36', 361, 1, 21, 712705) It has votes that count.
('36', 361, 1, 22, 712730) It can dictate policies.
('36', 361, 1, 23, 712755) It can defy Downing Street.
('36', 361, 1, 24, 712783) Mr. Andrews can to some extent cultivate and mould that opinion.
('36', 361, 1, 25, 712848) His very presence disarms criticism and silences opposition.
('36', 361, 1, 26, 712909) His place at the present moment is undoubtedly in South Africa.
('36', 361, 1, 27, 712973) And the deliberations of the Conference will affect not only the future of settlers in South Africa but they will indirectly influence the Asiatic policy of the other Dominions and Colonies.
('36', 361, 1, 28, 713164) But the settlers must not deceive themselves.
('36', 361, 1, 29, 713210) Mr. Andrews’s powerful intervention is indispensable for their cause.
('36', 361, 1, 30, 713280) But the ultimate success must depend upon themselves.
('36', 361, 1, 31, 713334) There is no help in the world.
('36', 361, 1, 32, 713365) like self help.
('36', 361, 1, 33, 713381) They must be firm but moderate in their demands; they must speak with one voice; they must act like one man; they must not swerve an inch from truth; they must discharge their part of the contract, i.
('36', 361, 1, 34, 713582) e., they must conform strictly to all sanitary and building regulations; and lastly they must be prepared in a body to suffer for their cause.
('36', 361, 1, 35, 713725) There is no salvation without suffering.

('36', 361, 4, 38, 713813) I commend to the attention of all who are interested in national education the convocation address of Acharya A. T. Gidwani delivered before the students of Kashi Vidyapith and from which I
('36', 362, 0, 1, 714003) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 363
('36', 362, 1, 2, 714048) reproduce elsewhere 1 the main extracts.
('36', 362, 1, 3, 714089) He is by no means despondent about national education or national educational institutions.
('36', 362, 1, 4, 714181) And in order to cure students of their despondency, he advises them like himself to visit pilgrim like the different national educational institutions and centres where national graduates are working.
('36', 362, 1, 5, 714382) I share Acharya Gidwani’s optimism.
('36', 362, 1, 6, 714418) But I do not blind myself, as I know the Acharya does not blind himself, to the grave limitations of the national institutions.
('36', 362, 1, 7, 714546) They do not show the virility of new institutions.
('36', 362, 1, 8, 714597) The teachers of these institutions have to show greater faith in national education and the institutions they are conducting.
('36', 362, 1, 9, 714723) They have to perform acts of greater surrender than hitherto.
('36', 362, 1, 10, 714785) I am convinced that these institutions, in so far as they are languishing, are so doing for the want of faith, the want of dedication on the part of the teachers.
('36', 362, 1, 11, 714948) They must dare to be original.
('36', 362, 1, 12, 714979) An attempt may be made to evolve by a conference a common system and a common policy.
('36', 362, 1, 13, 715065) But probably the better way lies in each institution evolving along its own original lines.
('36', 362, 1, 14, 715157) This country of ours is vast and variegated enough to warrant a variety of experiments.
('36', 362, 1, 15, 715245) There are certain things which are obviously common to all national institutions.
('36', 362, 1, 16, 715327) They do not need re telling.
('36', 362, 1, 17, 715356) The idea of pilgrimage on the part of the teachers to the various institutions is undoubtedly sound.
('36', 362, 1, 18, 715457) But even that idea presupposes a certain degree of buoyant faith.
('36', 362, 2, 19, 715523) There is too much of make believe, self deception and submission to convention.
('36', 362, 2, 20, 715603) The field of education which holds the seeds of the future of the children of the soil requires absolute sincerity, fearlessness in the pursuit of truth and boldest experiments, provided always that they are sound and based upon deep thought matured and sanctified by a life of consecration.
('36', 362, 2, 21, 715895) Not every tyro in education may make such experiments.
('36', 362, 2, 22, 715950) If the field is vast enough for sound experimenting, it is too dangerous for hasty and ill conceived prospecting such as people in feverish search of gold delight in.

('36', 362, 5, 25, 716176) Babu Bijay Bihari Mukharjee of the Bengal Civil Service has published a booklet on the cottage industry of Bengal.

('36', 362, 6, 27, 716306) 1 Young India, 30 9 1926, pp.
('36', 363, 0, 1, 716336) 364 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 363, 1, 2, 716378) the Beereshwar Mitter Gold Medal of the Calcutta University.
('36', 363, 1, 3, 716439) Whilst the conclusions of Babu Bijay Bihari are infirm, the facts he has set forth are well worth consideration by everyone who wishes well to this country.
('36', 363, 1, 4, 716596) They derive greater importance from the fact that what is true of Bengal is true almost of all India.
('36', 363, 2, 5, 716698) In Bengal, according to the census of 1921, out of every 1,000 persons only 68 live in towns.
('36', 363, 2, 6, 716792) Outside Calcutta and the metropolitan districts of Howrah, the 24 Parganas and Hooghly, there are three towns containing over 30,000 people.
('36', 363, 2, 7, 716933) It will not therefore be unreasonableto hold that of 46,695,536 of the population of the British territory in Bengal, scarcely more than about 13 lakhs of people are urban and the rest live mainly in the villages.
('36', 363, 2, 8, 717147) Therefore the writer naturally contends:
('36', 363, 3, 9, 717188) To develop the village and to secure for its inhabitants that sufficiency of comforts which is essential even in a country where only a little suffices, to organize it as a living entity in the body politic of the constitution is the crucial problem before the country.
('36', 363, 3, 10, 717458) The utterance of Sir Horace Plunkett that”we must have home before home rule” is true of Bengal as much as of Ireland to which he addressed it.
('36', 363, 3, 11, 717602) One need not ignore the effect of the form of government and the need for a change in it to be convinced of the paramount and supreme necessity of attempts to rehabilitate the ‘home’ in the villages.
('36', 363, 3, 12, 717802) In that scheme of rehabilitation the cottage industry is not merely helpful, but absolutely essential.
('36', 363, 3, 13, 717905) The author has no difficulty in showing that India was, at one time, not very remote, happy and prosperous.
('36', 363, 3, 14, 718013) He thus quotes Elphinstone:
('36', 363, 4, 15, 718041) All the descriptions of the parts of India visited by the Greeks give the idea of a country teeming with population and enjoying the highest degree of prosperity.
('36', 363, 4, 16, 718204) He has less difficulty in showing that the prosperity was mainly due to the one single industry of spinning and weaving.
('36', 363, 4, 17, 718325) But today hand spinning needs resurrection and weaving, though still an important cottage industry, does not need the same attention.
('36', 363, 4, 18, 718459) Today, there is no prosperity to note.
('36', 363, 4, 19, 718498) Three fourths of the people are dependent solely upon cultivation.
('36', 363, 4, 20, 718565) In Dacca and Faridpur 92% and in Midnapur 74% of the cultivable land is now under cultivation.
('36', 363, 4, 21, 718660) The average under cultivation per head of the agricultural population is respectively, .72, .73 and .84 acres for the three districts.
('36', 363, 4, 22, 718795) Thus there is little margin left for additional cultivation.
('36', 364, 0, 1, 718856) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 365
('36', 364, 1, 2, 718901) peasantry that is solely dependent on agriculture can possibly live on less than one acre of land.
('36', 364, 1, 3, 719000) The real average is far below the average given, because in the calculation are included are huge tracts owned by rich zamindars.
('36', 364, 2, 4, 719130) It is no wonder, therefore, that one of the highest officials of the Government had to declare that in this country half the people did not know what it was to have two meals a day.
('36', 364, 3, 5, 719312) The seriousness of the situation was expressed by the Famine Commission so long ago as 1877 78 thus: A main cause of the disastrousconsequences of Indian famines and one of the greatest difficulties in the way of providing relief in an effectual shape is to be found in the fact that the great mass of the people directly depend on agriculture and that there is no other industry from which any considerable part of the population derives support.
('36', 364, 3, 6, 719760) The failure of the usual rains deprives the labouring class as a whole, not only of the ordinary supplies of food obtainable at prices within their reach but also of the sole employment by which they can earn the means of procuring it.
('36', 364, 3, 7, 719996) The complete remedy, say the Commissioners, for this condition of things will be found only in the development of industries other than agriculture and independent of the fluctuations of the seasons.
('36', 364, 3, 8, 720196) The writer shows too that the bulk of the peasantry is occupied only during four months of the year.
('36', 364, 4, 9, 720297) The clerks, the officials, the lawyers, the doctors, the politicians, the teachers and all who believe themselves educated in English do not come up even to one per cent of the population.
('36', 364, 4, 10, 720486) I have remarked that the writer is weak in his conclusions.
('36', 364, 4, 11, 720546) The weakness in my opinion is derived from the fact that he has collected all possible cottage industries.
('36', 364, 4, 12, 720653) As a recital it is good enough.
('36', 364, 4, 13, 720685) But it does not solve the problem which needs a speedy solution.
('36', 364, 4, 14, 720750) For the vast bulk of the population, as also the worker in the villages, a museum of industries is simply bewildering.
('36', 364, 4, 15, 720869) They should have one universal industry.
('36', 364, 4, 16, 720910) And by a process of exclusion, one arrives at the irresistible conclusion that the only universal industry for the millions is spinning and no other.
('36', 364, 4, 17, 721060) That does not mean that other industries do not matter or are useless.
('36', 364, 4, 18, 721131) Indeed, from the individual standpoint, any other industry would be more remunerative than spinning.
('36', 364, 4, 19, 721232) Watch making will be no doubt most remunerative and fascinating industry.
('36', 364, 4, 20, 721306) But how many can engage in it?
('36', 364, 4, 21, 721337) Is it of any use to the millions of villagers?
('36', 364, 4, 22, 721384) But if the villagers can reconstruct their home, begin to live again as their fore fathers did, if they begin to make
('36', 365, 0, 1, 721502) 366 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 365, 1, 2, 721544) good use of their idle hours, all else, all the other industries will revive as a matter of course.
('36', 365, 1, 3, 721644) It is no use putting before famishing men a multiplicity of raw foods and expecting them to make their choice.
('36', 365, 1, 4, 721755) They would not know what to do with them.
('36', 365, 1, 5, 721797) They will probably rush after the most tempting and perish in the attempt.
('36', 365, 1, 6, 721872) I remember once in my life being nearly lynched whilst I was distributing rations to famished people.
('36', 365, 1, 7, 721974) I had to enclose and guard myself and the provisions before I could distribute what I had been given for distribution.
('36', 365, 1, 8, 722093) We make little headway because we have an unclassified catalogue of industries for the people to choose, when we should know that there is only one industry it is possible to put before all.
('36', 365, 1, 9, 722284) They may not all take it up.
('36', 365, 1, 10, 722313) Let those who can and wish to, by all means, take up any other.
('36', 365, 1, 11, 722377) But national resources must be concentrated upon the one industry of hand spinning which all can take up now and besides which the vast majority can take up no other.
('36', 365, 1, 12, 722544) And when the nation’s attention is thus rivetted on its revival, we will not have to be in search of a market for khaddar.
('36', 365, 1, 13, 722667) The energy and money that have today to be devoted to popularizing khaddar will tomorrow be devoted to its greater manufacture and to its improvement.
('36', 365, 1, 14, 722818) It is the national inertia that blinds us to the possibility of khaddar and thus paralyses our capacity for a grand national effort.
('36', 365, 1, 15, 722951) It is not enough to say that hand spinning is one of the industries to be revived.
('36', 365, 1, 16, 723034) It is necessary to insist that it is the central industry that must engage our attention if we are to re establish the village home.

('36', 366, 5, 8, 723874) DEAR FRIEND, I suppose it was for the sake of drawing us closer that Charlie Andrews commissioned me before leaving for South Africa to give you a line about him.
('36', 366, 5, 9, 724037) He was none too well when he left.
('36', 366, 5, 10, 724072) I was anxious to keep him with me for a little longer so that he might become stronger but he would not miss the steamer on which he had booked his passage.
('36', 366, 5, 11, 724229) His heart was with the distressed people in South Africa.
('36', 366, 5, 12, 724287) I therefore did not strive with him.
('36', 366, 5, 13, 724324) I hope that you are keeping well and strong.

('36', 369, 1, 3, 727930) My difficulty, however, is more fundamental than you imagine.
('36', 369, 1, 4, 727992) But fundamental though it is, it is not so serious as perhaps you imagine.
('36', 369, 1, 5, 728067) I am in search of a guru because I am humble and because that search is a scientific necessity for every godfearing man.
('36', 369, 1, 6, 728188) The search is its own reward and its own satisfaction.
('36', 369, 1, 7, 728243) Some do get the guru they want.
('36', 369, 1, 8, 728275) But it is not a matter of such moment if they cannot get the guru during the current incarnation.
('36', 369, 1, 9, 728373) It is enough if the search is absolutely sincere and equally persistent.
('36', 369, 1, 10, 728446) It is also an article of faith with me that, if my search is sincere and persistent, my guru will come to me instead of my having to go to him if and when I deserve him.
('36', 369, 1, 11, 728616) I am therefore quite content to remain as I am and there is enough warrant in the Shastras for such contentment.
('36', 369, 1, 12, 728729) You will, therefore, not consider it a matter of indifference on my part if I cannot take up your suggestion enthusiastically and proceed to Agra.
('36', 369, 1, 13, 728876) At the same time, if ever I do go to Agra in the course of my travels, I would certainly like to see the institution described by you.
('36', 369, 1, 14, 729011) I would like too to have more information about it.
('36', 369, 1, 15, 729063) I know the prototype in Pabna of the Agra institution.
('36', 369, 1, 16, 729118) I had a long chat about it with Deshbandhu.
('36', 369, 1, 17, 729162) He was undoubtedly enthusiastic about it.
('36', 369, 1, 18, 729204) He had great faith in the Thakur and it was out of regard for him that I made it a point when I visited Pabna to see the Sat Sangh Mutt and to make the acquaintance of the Thakur and his mother and the inmates of the Mutt.
('36', 369, 1, 19, 729427) But I must tell you that I was not much impressed either with the Thakur or with all I saw in the institution.
('36', 369, 1, 20, 729538) And what I have since heard about the institution is not very creditable to it.
('36', 369, 1, 21, 729618) The information given to me may be totally incorrect.
('36', 369, 1, 22, 729672) But I am telling you somewhat of what I know and what I have heard about it.

('36', 371, 5, 7, 731790) 425. MADHADA ASHRAM
('36', 371, 6, 8, 731810) I made some reference in Navajivan, 1 about a year ago, to the state of affairs in the Madhada Ashram, having received complaints in regard to it.
('36', 371, 6, 9, 731957) I then started correspondence with Shri Shivji on the subject.
('36', 371, 6, 10, 732020) He agreed to show me the accounts of the Ashram.
('36', 371, 6, 11, 732069) I sent a personal representative to look into them, and he did so.
('36', 371, 6, 12, 732136) But Bhai Shivji did not show him some of the account books on the ground that they related to private property.
('36', 371, 7, 13, 732248) I received grave charges regarding the moral character of Shri Shivji.
('36', 371, 7, 14, 732319) I communicated them to him.
('36', 371, 7, 15, 732347) And he gave me permission to institute an inquiry into the matter.
('36', 371, 7, 16, 732414) Those who had made the charges were, all of them, responsible persons.
('36', 371, 7, 17, 732485) Shri came and met me in the Ashram in connection with this matter.
('36', 371, 7, 18, 732552) His confessions in regard to the charges gave me a painful shock.
('36', 371, 7, 19, 732618) I advised him to resign from the Conference 2 and to give up control of the institutions under his charge.
('36', 371, 7, 20, 732725) He resigned, but did not leave the institutions.
('36', 371, 7, 21, 732774) I acquainted theExecutive Committee of the Conference with the conversation I had with Shri Shivji, and told them what according to me the duty of a public worker required him to do in this situation.
('36', 371, 7, 22, 732975) I requested the members not to divulge what I had told them.
('36', 371, 8, 23, 733036) I informed Shri Shivji that I would have to issue a public statement of some kind.
('36', 371, 8, 24, 733119) He requested me not to do so and expressed a desire to see me.
('36', 371, 8, 25, 733182) We met.
('36', 371, 8, 26, 733190) Shri Shivji felt that I had done him great injustice.
('36', 371, 8, 27, 733244) I tried to pacify him but to no effect.
('36', 371, 8, 28, 733284) He says that he had made his confessions in sheer anger.
('36', 371, 8, 29, 733341) He believes that I was excited during my conversation with him, and says that, because I was excited,

('36', 372, 1, 2, 733641) he too got excited and was betrayed into making statements which were not true.
('36', 372, 1, 3, 733721) In view of this, I told him that I was willing to place this matter before a panch.
('36', 372, 1, 4, 733805) It is possible that I have been led away by prejudice and have unintentionally done him injustice.
('36', 372, 1, 5, 733904) If the panch believe, after hearing my account that I was prejudiced and if they can convince me that I was so, then I will admit my error and publicly apologize.
('36', 372, 1, 6, 734067) If I do not agree with the finding of the panch and if they ask me to maintain silence in public on this subject, I will do so.
('36', 372, 2, 7, 734195) Shri Shivji is not agreeable to this.
('36', 372, 2, 8, 734233) He sent me a draft of the terms of reference for the proposed panch, which I refused to sign.
('36', 372, 2, 9, 734327) According to my previous decision, therefore, I must publish the facts.
('36', 372, 2, 10, 734399) I have given sufficient time to Shri Shivji and tried to understand his arguments, so that I may not do him injustice in any way.
('36', 372, 2, 11, 734529) His friends have written somewhat strong letters to me.
('36', 372, 2, 12, 734585) They have testified to Shri Shivji’s innocence.
('36', 372, 2, 13, 734633) I have read all the letters carefully but I am sorry to state that they have had a contrary effect on me.
('36', 372, 2, 14, 734739) I do not at all feel that I was excited or angry during my conversation with Shri Shivji.
('36', 372, 2, 15, 734829) I am not quick to get angry.
('36', 372, 2, 16, 734858) Nor is it my impression that Shri Shivji had made his confessions to me in sheer excitement.
('36', 372, 2, 17, 734951) I believe that the affairs of the Madhada Ashram and the private properties are so mixed up that it was, and is, Shri Shivji’s duty to show all the accounts.
('36', 372, 2, 18, 735109) His serious admissions create doubts about his moral character too.
('36', 372, 2, 19, 735177) No public worker can afford to have moral weaknesses implied in his admissions.
('36', 372, 3, 20, 735257) Anyone who runs an institution for widows or young men or women should maintain a particularly high standard of conduct.
('36', 372, 3, 21, 735378) He cannot have a private life; it is my firm view that the public has a right to know everything about his life.
('36', 372, 3, 22, 735491) Shri Shivji is a public worker and has been running an institution for young men and women and for widows.
('36', 372, 3, 23, 735598) The activities of the Madhada Ashram were many sided, and that is why I have, as a matter of duty and with great pain, given publicity to the most important aspect of the conclusions of the inquiry I had instituted.
('36', 372, 4, 24, 735814) Bhai Shivji and his friends will be pained by this.
('36', 372, 4, 25, 735866) I can give them only one consolation, and that is to assure them that I have felt, and still feel, much more deeply pained by the impression which has been produced on my mind by the affair than they would feel by my writing this.
('36', 372, 4, 26, 736097) I do not wish to see anyone in this world morally degraded.
('36', 372, 4, 27, 736157) I feel ashamed to see even one person fall.

('36', 373, 1, 2, 736260) that when an individual falls the whole society falls.
('36', 373, 1, 3, 736315) If I could have avoided writing this, I would certainly have kept silent.
('36', 373, 1, 4, 736389) I prefer silence in such matters.
('36', 373, 1, 5, 736423) But does anyone always get what would make him happy?
('36', 373, 1, 6, 736477) I regard myself as a true friend of Shri Shivji.
('36', 373, 1, 7, 736526) This article does not mean that I have washed my hands of this affair.
('36', 373, 1, 8, 736597) I have given him sufficient time.
('36', 373, 1, 9, 736631) I am ready to give still more time if required.
('36', 373, 1, 10, 736679) If any of Shri Shivji’s friends can show me that I am in error, I will be grateful to him and will be happy to admit my mistake.
('36', 373, 1, 11, 736808) If Shri Shivji or any of his friends wishes to write something by way of reply to this, I will publish the whole reply provided it is reasonably short.
('36', 373, 1, 12, 736960) I should like to tell Shri Shivji’s friends that even if a hundred thousand persons believe a person to be innocent but one individual can prove his guilt, then the evidence of those hundred thousand does not avail.
('36', 373, 1, 13, 737176) I find it necessary to say this in order that people may not write to me the kind of letters which I have been lately receiving for publication

('36', 374, 11, 22, 739143) If, however, you have confidence in yourself and if Malaviyaji wishes that you should enter it, you may certainly do so.
('36', 374, 11, 23, 739264) One should not readily give up the work one has already taken in hand.

('36', 377, 10, 15, 743011) It is our moral duty to wear hand woven khadi made from hand spun yarn, for by doing so we provide employment and give food to crores of our brothers and sisters who are starving for want of work.
('36', 377, 11, 16, 743208) Spinning is a moral duty for all of us, for unless we take it up the poor of the country will have no faith in it andin us.

('36', 378, 7, 9, 744240) Do you know that in the Ashram the main work is labouring with one’s hands and feet?
('36', 378, 7, 10, 744325) Are you satisfied with incessant labour at the spinning wheel or the loom and doing sanitation work such as cleaning roads, sanitary buckets, etc.?
('36', 378, 7, 11, 744473) Are you able to live as a brahmachari, and take the vow of poverty?
('36', 378, 7, 12, 744541) Are you keeping good health?
('36', 378, 7, 13, 744570) If your answers to these questions are satisfactory, I must say that just at the present moment, the Ashram is overcrowded, but as soon as there is a vacant room available, you can certainly be admitted as a probationer.
('36', 378, 8, 14, 744791) Your sincerely, SJT.

('36', 378, 10, 17, 744876) 435. VEGETARIANISM
('36', 378, 11, 18, 744895) A correspondent is born in a meat eating family.
('36', 378, 11, 19, 744944) He has successfully resisted the pressure from his parents to return to the flesh pot.
('36', 378, 11, 20, 745031) But, he says, in a book I have before me:
('36', 378, 12, 21, 745073) I read the opinion of Swami Vivekananda on the subject and feel a good deal shaken in my belief.
('36', 378, 12, 22, 745170) The Swami holds that for Indians in their present state flesh diet is a necessity and he advises his friends to eat flesh freely.
('36', 378, 12, 23, 745300) He even goes so far as to say”If you incur any sin thereby throw it upon me; I will bear it.” I am now in a fix whether to eat flesh or not.
('36', 379, 0, 1, 745441) 380 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 379, 1, 2, 745483) This blind worship of authority is a sign of weakness of mind.
('36', 379, 1, 3, 745546) If the correspondent has such a deep seated conviction that flesh eating is not right, why should he be moved by the opinion to the contrary of the whole world?
('36', 379, 1, 4, 745707) One needs to be slow to form convictions, but once formed they must be defended against the heaviest odds.
('36', 379, 1, 5, 745814) As for the opinion of the great Swami, I have not seen the actual writing but I fear the correspondent has correctly quoted him.
('36', 379, 1, 6, 745943) My opinion is well known.
('36', 379, 1, 7, 745969) I do not regard flesh food as necessary for us at any stage and under any clime in which it is possible for human beings ordinarily to live.
('36', 379, 1, 8, 746110) I hold flesh food to be unsuited to our species.
('36', 379, 1, 9, 746159) We err in copying the lower animal world if we are superior to it.
('36', 379, 1, 10, 746226) Experience teaches that animal food is unsuited to those who would curb their passions.
('36', 379, 1, 11, 746314) But it is wrong to over estimate the importance of food in the formation of character or in subjugating the flesh.
('36', 379, 1, 12, 746429) Diet is a powerful factor not to be neglected.
('36', 379, 1, 13, 746476) But to sum up all religion in terms of diet, as is often done in India, is as wrong as it is to disregard all restraint in regard to diet and to give full reins to one’s appetite.
('36', 379, 1, 14, 746656) Vegetarianism is one of the priceless gifts of Hinduism.
('36', 379, 1, 15, 746713) It may not be lightly given up.
('36', 379, 1, 16, 746745) It is necessary therefore to correct the error that vegetarianism has made us weak in mind or body or passive or inert in action.
('36', 379, 1, 17, 746875) The greatest Hindu reformers have been the activest in their generation and they have invariably been vegetarians.
('36', 379, 1, 18, 746990) Who could show greater activity than, say, Sankara or Dayanand in their times?
('36', 379, 1, 19, 747069) But my correspondent must not accept me as his authority.
('36', 379, 1, 20, 747127) The choice of one’s diet is not a thing to be based on faith.
('36', 379, 1, 21, 747189) It is a matter for everyone to reason out for himself.
('36', 379, 1, 22, 747244) There has grown up especially in the West an amount of literature on vegetarianism which any seeker after truth may study with profit.
('36', 379, 1, 23, 747379) Many eminent medical men have contributed to this literature.
('36', 379, 1, 24, 747441) Here, in India, we have not needed any encouragement for vegetarianism.
('36', 379, 1, 25, 747513) For it has been hitherto accepted as the most desirable and the most respectable thing.
('36', 379, 1, 26, 747601) Those, however, who like the correspondent feel shaken, may study the growing movement towards vegetarianism in the West.

('36', 380, 2, 3, 747825) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, May 12, 1926
('36', 380, 3, 4, 747861) DEAR FRIEND, I had the 2nd volume of”The Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey” 1 or”Africa for Africans” for which I thank you.
('36', 380, 4, 5, 747993) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI AMY JACQUES GARVEY P. O. BOX NO.

('36', 380, 6, 8, 748179) 437. THE SAME OLD ARGUMENT
('36', 380, 7, 9, 748206) After reciting the evils from which we are suffering and after dealing with the improvements he would make in agriculture, a correspondent writes: 2
('36', 380, 8, 10, 748355) This is the old argument restated.
('36', 380, 8, 11, 748390) The correspondent forgets that to make India like England and America is to find some other races and places of the earth for exploitation.
('36', 380, 8, 12, 748530) So far it appears that the Western nations have divided all the known races outside Europe for exploitation and that there are no new worlds to discover.
('36', 380, 8, 13, 748684) Among the exploited, India is the greatest victim.
('36', 380, 8, 14, 748735) Japan is taking the share of the spoils no doubt.
('36', 380, 8, 15, 748785) But if India and China refuse to be exploited what will happen to the exploiters?
('36', 380, 8, 16, 748867) And if the Western nations plus Japan are likely to come to grief in the event of India and China refusing to be exploited, what can be the fate of India trying to ape the West?
('36', 380, 8, 17, 749045) Indeed, the West had had a surfeit of industrialism and exploitation.
('36', 380, 8, 18, 749115) If they who are suffering from the disease are unable to find a remedy
('36', 380, 9, 19, 749186) 1 Marcus Garvey was the Chairman of the Fourth International Convention of the Negro Peoples of the World.
('36', 380, 9, 20, 749293) 2 Not reproduced here.
('36', 380, 9, 21, 749316) The correspondent had argued that modern civilization including steamships, railways, machinery and large scale production should be accepted.
('36', 381, 0, 1, 749459) 382 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 381, 1, 2, 749501) to correct the evils, how shall we, mere novices, be able to avoid them?
('36', 381, 1, 3, 749574) The fact is that this industrial civilization is a disease because it is all evil.
('36', 381, 1, 4, 749657) Let us not be deceived by catchwords and phrases.
('36', 381, 1, 5, 749707) I have no quarrel with steamships or telegraphs.
('36', 381, 1, 6, 749756) They may stay, if they can, without the support of industrialism and all it connotes.
('36', 381, 1, 7, 749842) They are not an end.
('36', 381, 1, 8, 749863) We must not suffer exploitation for the sake of steamships and telegraphs.
('36', 381, 1, 9, 749938) They are in no way indispensable for the permanent welfare of the human race.
('36', 381, 1, 10, 750016) Now that we know the use of steam and electricity, we should be able to use them on due occasion and after we have learnt to avoid industrialism.
('36', 381, 1, 11, 750162) Our concern is, therefore, to destroy industrialism at any cost.
('36', 381, 2, 12, 750227) The correspondent has suggested the remedy without knowing it himself.
('36', 381, 2, 13, 750298) For he admits that India has lived till now when other nations have perished because”she has adapted herself to changing conditions”.
('36', 381, 2, 14, 750432) Adaptability is not imitation.
('36', 381, 2, 15, 750463) It means power of resistance and assimilation.
('36', 381, 2, 16, 750510) India has withstood the onslaughts of other civilizations because she has stood firm on her own ground.
('36', 381, 2, 17, 750614) Not that she has not made changes.
('36', 381, 2, 18, 750649) But the changes she has made have promoted her growth.
('36', 381, 2, 19, 750704) To change to industrialism is to court disaster.
('36', 381, 2, 20, 750753) The present distress is undoubtedly insufferable.
('36', 381, 2, 21, 750803) Pauperism must go.
('36', 381, 2, 22, 750822) But industrialism is no remedy.
('36', 381, 2, 23, 750854) The evil does not lie in the use of bullock carts.
('36', 381, 2, 24, 750905) It lies in our selfishness and want of consideration for our neighbours.
('36', 381, 2, 25, 750978) If we have no love for our neighbours, no change however revolutionary can do us any good.
('36', 381, 2, 26, 751069) And if we love our neighbours, the paupers of India, for their sakes, we shall use what they make for us; for their sakes we, who should know, shall not engage in an immoral traffic with the West in the shape of buying the foreign fineries and taking them to the villages.
('36', 381, 3, 27, 751342) If we would but think seriously and persistently, we shall discover that before we make any other changes, the one great change to make is to discard foreign cloth and reinstate the ancient cottage industry of hand spinning.
('36', 381, 3, 28, 751567) We must thus restore our ancient and health giving industry if we would resist industrialism.
('36', 381, 4, 29, 751661) I do not fight shy of capital.
('36', 381, 4, 30, 751692) I fight capitalism.
('36', 381, 4, 31, 751712) The West teaches one to avoid concentration of capital, to avoid a racial war in another and deadlier form.
('36', 381, 4, 32, 751820) Capital and labour need not be antagonistic to each other.
('36', 381, 4, 33, 751879) I cannot picture to myself a time when no man shall be richer than another.
('36', 381, 4, 34, 751955) But I do picture to myself a time when the rich will spurn to enrich themselves at the expense of the poor and the

('36', 382, 1, 2, 752115) poor will cease to envy the rich.
('36', 382, 1, 3, 752149) Even in a most perfect world, we shall fail to avoid inequalities, but we can and must avoid strife and bitterness.
('36', 382, 1, 4, 752265) There are numerous examples extant of the rich and the poor living in perfect friendliness.
('36', 382, 1, 5, 752357) We have but to multiply such instances.
('36', 382, 1, 6, 752397) India’s destiny lies not along the bloody way of the West, of which she shows signs of tiredness, but along the bloodless way of peace that comes from a simple and godly life.
('36', 382, 1, 7, 752573) India is in danger of losing her soul.
('36', 382, 1, 8, 752612) She cannot lose it and live.
('36', 382, 1, 9, 752641) She must not, therefore, lazily and helplessly say,”I cannot escape the onrush from the West.” She must be strong enough to resist it for her own sake and that of the world.

('36', 382, 4, 12, 752865) “A Hindu lady from Bengal” writes: 1
('36', 382, 5, 13, 752902) Whether the picture drawn here is true to life or overdrawn, the substance is surely true.
('36', 382, 5, 14, 752993) I do not need to search for evidence in support.
('36', 382, 5, 15, 753042) I know a medical man enjoying a large practice having married and taken to himself, an elderly widower, a girl who was young enough to be his daughter.
('36', 382, 5, 16, 753194) They were living together as”husband and wife”.
('36', 382, 5, 17, 753242) Another, a sixty year old educationist a widower, married a girl of nine years.
('36', 382, 5, 18, 753322) Though everybody knew of the scandal and recognized it as such, he remained inspector outwardly, respected both by the Government and the public.
('36', 382, 5, 19, 753468) It is possible for me to recall more such instances from my memory and that of friends.
('36', 382, 5, 20, 753556) The fair correspondent is correct in saying that”there is no power of resistance left” in the women of India”to fight against any evil whatever”.
('36', 382, 5, 21, 753702) No doubt man is primarily responsible for this state of things.
('36', 382, 5, 22, 753766) But may women always throw the blame on women and salve their consciences?
('36', 382, 5, 23, 753841) Do the enlightened among them not owe it to their sex, as also to men whose mothers they are, to take up the burden of reform?
('36', 382, 5, 24, 753968) What is all the education worth that they are receiving if, on

('36', 382, 6, 26, 754054) The correspondent had thanked Gandhiji for”speaking on behalf of the poor girl wives of our Hindu Society” and cited cases of 10 year old girl wives being either killed or cruelly maltreated by brutal and pleasure craving husbands.

('36', 383, 1, 5, 754539) It provides them with innocent recreation.
('36', 383, 1, 6, 754582) But where are the brave women who work among the girl wives and girl widows, and who would take no rest and leave none for men, till girl marriages become an impossibility, and till every girl feels in herself strength enough to refuse to be married except when she is of full age and to the person about whom she is given the final choice?

('36', 383, 3, 9, 754970) Here is eloquence which I have not abridged except for the removal of a fling or two at the”magnates of wealth” with their”cesspools in the bed of economic stream”: 1
('36', 383, 4, 10, 755137) I read your article”Students’ Duty” of the 16th September.
('36', 383, 4, 11, 755196) You refuse to guide the unwilling.
('36', 383, 4, 12, 755231) The thought of the coming millennium makes it a pleasure to spin.
('36', 383, 5, 13, 755297) Meanwhile, your forces fret under famine rations and laziness imposed upon them.
('36', 383, 6, 14, 755378) Spinning for creating the charkha atmosphere does not occupy all the time .
('36', 383, 6, 15, 755454) I am sure men will not have to rot for want of work and bread in your scheme of swaraj.
('36', 383, 6, 16, 755542) Working as we do on your terms, we have a right to ask for satisfaction.
('36', 383, 6, 17, 755615) I expect it in the columns of Young India early, as weariness of life grows every minute The correspondent seems to possess a fine sense of humour and, therefore, does not need much satisfaction from me.
('36', 383, 6, 18, 755819) But for the enlightenment of those No changers, who may be in the same position as he is, but who do not possess the same sense of humour, I may state that, having taken the post of schoolmaster in a Taluq Board school, I should stick to it and spread the gospel of khaddar and only leave the post when I get a job more after the heart of a No changer; and then too if it can be left without putting the employers to inconvenience.
('36', 383, 6, 19, 756251) A conscientious worker will never leave his employer in the lurch or use an existing job as a mere stalking horse.
('36', 383, 6, 20, 756366) The correspondent could, however, have finished his course of weaving.
('36', 383, 6, 21, 756437) A good pattern weaver any day earns one rupee per day.

('36', 384, 1, 3, 756652) One who has caught the spirit of the spinning movement need never feel idle.
('36', 384, 1, 4, 756729) Has the correspondent mastered the science of spinning?
('36', 384, 1, 5, 756785) Does he know ginning and carding?
('36', 384, 1, 6, 756819) He can then earn from eight annas to a rupee per day from ginning and carding.
('36', 384, 1, 7, 756898) But, presently there will be the Khadi Service.
('36', 384, 1, 8, 756946) One who is poor but willing can sustain oneself even whilst qualifying for the Service.
('36', 384, 1, 9, 757034) There is illimitable scope for those honest men and women who do not mind toiling with their bodies and would be satisfied with a simple sustenance wage and have no ambition for riches or fame.

('36', 384, 4, 12, 757269) In my article on”Non resistance” in the issue of 23rd September, I said the paper from which I have quoted was received from an American friend.
('36', 384, 4, 13, 757414) 1 This was a mistake.
('36', 384, 4, 14, 757436) The sender who is an Indian and is living in India now draws my attention to the fact that it was he who had received it in the first instance from his American friend and that therefore the sender to me was not an American friend.
('36', 384, 4, 15, 757668) I apologize for the error which was unintentional.
('36', 384, 4, 16, 757719) I had put the paper among the Young India matter file for attention and had forgotten that it was sent by an Indian friend.

('36', 385, 6, 14, 759142) DEAR DR.
('36', 385, 6, 15, 759151) MURARILAL, I have your letter.
('36', 385, 6, 16, 759182) All my sympathies are with you in your great loss.
('36', 385, 6, 17, 759233) I had no idea that your brother had died.
('36', 385, 6, 18, 759275) But it is a toll which every public worker is often called upon to pay.
('36', 385, 6, 19, 759347) With reference to the election bitterness, you attribute to me powers which I do not possess.
('36', 385, 6, 20, 759441) Could I have felt that I could usefully intervene, believe me, I would have waited for no call; I would have forced myself on the attention of Panditji and Lalaji.
('36', 385, 6, 21, 759605) But I know my powerlessness and, therefore, I grin and bear.
('36', 385, 6, 22, 759666) Yours sincerely, DR.

('36', 386, 1, 3, 760053) If we succumb to it, we remain rooted to the earth.

('36', 386, 1, 5, 760140) The tongue is given to us to taste and to speak.
('36', 386, 1, 6, 760189) But the more we restrain it the better we are, and so with most things in nature.
('36', 386, 1, 7, 760271) It would be wrong, therefore, to say that it is a fetish of nature’s law to restrain our carnal aptitude.

('36', 386, 6, 13, 760527) BHAISHRI BHAVANIDAYAL, I have your letter.
('36', 386, 6, 14, 760570) I think I wrote to you giving my opinion.
('36', 386, 6, 15, 760612) Even so, I give it here again.
('36', 386, 6, 16, 760643) After going through the whole of the book, I realized that I was wrong in having described it as containing slanders.
('36', 386, 6, 17, 760761) I ask your forgiveness for having done you injustice.
('36', 386, 6, 18, 760815) I do not recollect now after reading which book of yours I formed this opinion.
('36', 386, 6, 19, 760895) And now I reply to your letter.
('36', 386, 6, 20, 760927) As history, the book leaves much to be desired.
('36', 386, 6, 21, 760975) All the facts are not stated correctly.
('36', 386, 6, 22, 761015) I have not read it from the point of view of historical accuracy, nor have I the time to read it from that point of view and make corrections.
('36', 386, 6, 23, 761158) The fact is that very few of us have the skill of writing anything from the standpoint of history.
('36', 386, 6, 24, 761257) Even the account of the satyagraha struggle [in South Africa] which I have written should be treated not as a book of history.
('36', 386, 6, 25, 761384) I have only given in it my experiences and reminiscences.
('36', 386, 6, 26, 761442) I, therefore, consider it difficult as also irrelevant to take notice of your book in my autobiography.

('36', 388, 7, 8, 763410) 448. IS THIS HUMANITY? I 1
('36', 388, 8, 9, 763437) [October 10, 1926] 2
('36', 388, 9, 10, 763458) The Ahmedabad Humanitarian League has addressed me a letter from which I take the relevant portions:
('36', 388, 10, 11, 763559) The talk of the whole city of Ahmedabad is the destruction of 60 dogs on his mill premises at the instance of Seth.
('36', 388, 10, 12, 763675) Many a humanitarian heart is considerably agitated over the incident.
('36', 388, 10, 13, 763745) When Hinduism forbids the taking of the life of any living being, when it declares it to be a sin, do you think it right to kill rabid dogs for the reason that they would bite human beings and by biting other dogs make them also rabid?
('36', 388, 10, 14, 763981) Are not the man who actually destroys the dogs as also the man at whose instance he does so both sinners?
('36', 388, 10, 15, 764087) A deputation of three gentlemen from our Society waited on the Seth on the 28th ultimo.
('36', 388, 10, 16, 764175) He confessed in the course of the interview that he had to take the course in question to save human life.
('36', 388, 10, 17, 764282) He also said:”I myself had no sleep on the night I took that decision.
('36', 388, 10, 18, 764353) I met Mahatmaji the next morning and ascertained his view in the matter.
('36', 388, 10, 19, 764426) He said, ‘What else could be done?’” Is that a fact?
('36', 388, 10, 20, 764479) And if so, what does it mean?
('36', 388, 10, 21, 764509) We hope you will express your views in the matter and set the whole controversy at rest and prevent humanitarianism from beingendangered by the shocks given to it by distinguished men like the Seth.
('36', 388, 10, 22, 764708) The Ahmedabad Municipality, we have heard, is soon going to have before it a resolution for the castration of stray dogs.
('36', 388, 10, 23, 764830) Is it proper?
('36', 388, 10, 24, 764844) Does religion
('36', 388, 11, 25, 764858) 1 This is the first of a series of eight Gujarati articles published in Navajivan.
('36', 388, 11, 26, 764941) These were later translated by Mahadev Desai into English and published in Young India.
('36', 388, 12, 27, 765029) 2 The articles are placed under the date of publication in Navajivan.
('36', 389, 0, 1, 765099) 390 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 389, 1, 2, 765141) sanction the castration of an animal?
('36', 389, 1, 3, 765179) We should be thankful if you would give your opinion in this matter also.
('36', 389, 1, 4, 765253) Ahmedabad knows the name of the mill owner, but as Navajivan is being read outside Ahmedabad also, I have omitted to mention his name in accordance with my practice to avoid personalities whilst discussing a principle.
('36', 389, 1, 5, 765472) The question raised by the Humanitarian Society is an intricate one.
('36', 389, 1, 6, 765541) I had been thinking of discussing the question ever since and even before the incident, but on second thought dropped the idea.
('36', 389, 1, 7, 765669) But the letter of the Society now compels me, makes it my duty, to enter into a public discussion of the question.
('36', 389, 2, 8, 765784) I must say that my relations with the mill owner, have been sweet, and, if I may say so, friendly.
('36', 389, 2, 9, 765883) He came to me and expressed his distress in having had to order destruction of the dogs, and asked my opinion about it.
('36', 389, 2, 10, 766003) He also said:”When the Government, the Municipality and the Mahajan all alike failed to guide me, I was driven to this course.” I gave him the reply that the Society’s letter attributes to me.
('36', 389, 3, 11, 766196) I have since thought over the matter and feel that my reply was quite proper.
('36', 389, 3, 12, 766274) Imperfect, erring mortals as we are, there is no course open to us but the destruction of rabid dogs.
('36', 389, 3, 13, 766376) At times we may be faced with the unavoidable duty of killing a man who is found in the act of killing people.
('36', 389, 4, 14, 766487) If we persist in keeping stray dogs undisturbed, we shall soon be faced with the duty of either castrating them or killing them.
('36', 389, 4, 15, 766616) A third alternative is that of having a special pinjrapole for dogs.
('36', 389, 4, 16, 766685) But it is out of the question.
('36', 389, 4, 17, 766716) When we cannot cope with all the stray cattle in the city, the very proposal of having a pinjrapole for dogs seems to me to be chimerical.
('36', 389, 4, 18, 766855) There can be no two opinions on the fact that Hinduism regards killing a living being as sinful.
('36', 389, 4, 19, 766952) I think all religions are agreed on the principle.
('36', 389, 4, 20, 767003) There is generally no difficulty in determining a principle.
('36', 389, 4, 21, 767064) The difficult comes in when one proceeds to put it into practice.
('36', 389, 4, 22, 767130) A principle is the expression of a perfection, and as imperfect beings like us cannot practise perfection, we devise every moment limits of its compromise in practice; So Hinduism has laid down that killing for sacrifice is no ahimsa (violence).
('36', 389, 4, 23, 767376) This is only a half truth.
('36', 389, 4, 24, 767403) Violence will be violence for all time, and all violence is sinful.
('36', 389, 4, 25, 767471) But what is inevitable is not regarded as a sin, so much so that the science of daily
('36', 390, 0, 1, 767557) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 391
('36', 390, 1, 2, 767602) practice has not only declared the inevitable violence involved in killing for sacrifice as permissible, but even regarded it as meritorious.
('36', 390, 1, 3, 767744) But unavoidable violence cannot be defined.
('36', 390, 1, 4, 767788) For it changes with time, place and person.
('36', 390, 1, 5, 767832) What is regarded as excusable at one time may be inexcusable at another.
('36', 390, 1, 6, 767905) The violence involved in burning fuel or coal in the depth of winter to keep the body warm may be unavoidable and, therefore, a duty for weak bodied man, but fire unnecessarily lit in midsummer is clearly violence.
('36', 390, 1, 7, 768120) We recognize the duty of killing microbes by the use of disinfectants.
('36', 390, 1, 8, 768191) It is violence and yet a duty.
('36', 390, 1, 9, 768222) But why go even as far as that?
('36', 390, 1, 10, 768254) The air in a dark, closed room is full of little microbes, and the introduction of light and air into it by opening it is destruction indeed.
('36', 390, 1, 11, 768396) But it is ever a duty to use that finest of disinfectants—pure air.
('36', 390, 1, 12, 768464) These instances can be multiplied.
('36', 390, 1, 13, 768499) The principle that applies in the instances cited applies in the matter of killing rabid dogs.
('36', 390, 1, 14, 768594) To destroy a rabid dog is to commit the minimum amount of violence.
('36', 390, 1, 15, 768662) A recluse, who is living in a forest and is compassion incarnate, may not destroy a rabid dog.
('36', 390, 1, 16, 768757) For in his compassion he has the virtue of making it whole.
('36', 390, 1, 17, 768817) But a city dweller who is responsible for the protection of lives under his care and who does not possess the virtues of the recluse, but is capable of destroying a rabid dog, is faced with a conflict of duties.
('36', 390, 1, 18, 769029) If he kills the dog, he commits a sin.
('36', 390, 1, 19, 769068) If he does not kill it, he commits a graver sin.
('36', 390, 1, 20, 769117) So he prefers to commit the lesser one and save himself from the graver.
('36', 390, 1, 21, 769190) I believe myself to be saturated with ahimsa—non violence.
('36', 390, 1, 22, 769249) Ahimsa and Truth are as my two lungs.
('36', 390, 1, 23, 769287) I cannot live without them.
('36', 390, 1, 24, 769315) But I see every moment, with more and more clearness, the immense power of ahimsa and the littleness of man.
('36', 390, 1, 25, 769424) Even the forest dweller cannot be entirely free from violence, in spite of his limitless compassion.
('36', 390, 1, 26, 769525) With every breath he commits a certain amount of violence.
('36', 390, 1, 27, 769584) The body itself is a house of slaughter, and therefore moksha and Eternal Bliss consist in perfect deliverance from the body and, therefore, all pleasure, save the joy of moksha, is evanescent, imperfect.
('36', 390, 1, 28, 769789) That being the case, we have to drink, in daily life, many a bitter draught of violence.
('36', 390, 1, 29, 769878) It is therefore a thousand pities that the question of stray dogs, etc., assumes such a monstrous proportion in this sacred land of ahimsa.
('36', 390, 1, 30, 770018) It is my firm conviction that we are propagatinghimsa
('36', 391, 0, 1, 770072) 392 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 391, 1, 2, 770114) in the name of ahimsa owing to our deep ignorance of the great principle.
('36', 391, 1, 3, 770188) It may be a sin to destroy rabid dogs and such others as are liable to catch rabies.
('36', 391, 1, 4, 770273) But we are responsible, the mahajan is responsible, for this state of things.
('36', 391, 1, 5, 770351) The mahajan may not allow the dogs to stray.
('36', 391, 1, 6, 770396) It is a sin, it should be a sin, to feed stray dogs, and we should save numerous dogs if we had legislation making every stray dog liable to be shot.
('36', 391, 1, 7, 770546) Even if those who feed stray dogs consented to pay a penalty for their misdirected compassion we should be free from the curse of stray dogs.
('36', 391, 1, 8, 770688) Humanity is a noble attribute of the soul.
('36', 391, 1, 9, 770731) It is not exhausted with saving a few fish or a few dogs.
('36', 391, 1, 10, 770789) Such saving may even be sinful.
('36', 391, 1, 11, 770821) If I have a swarm of ants in my house, the man who proceeds to feed them will be guilty of a sin.
('36', 391, 1, 12, 770919) For God has provided their grain for the ants, but the man who feeds them might destroy me and my family.
('36', 391, 1, 13, 771025) The mahajan may feel itself safe and believe that it has saved their lives by dumping dogs near my field, but it will have committed the greater sin of putting my life in danger.
('36', 391, 1, 14, 771204) Humaneness is impossible without thought, discrimination, charity, fearlessness, humility and clear vision.
('36', 391, 1, 15, 771312) It is no easy thing to walk on the sharp sword edge of ahimsa in this world which is so full of himsa.
('36', 391, 1, 16, 771415) Wealth does not help; anger is the enemy of ahimsa; and pride is a monster that swallows it up.
('36', 391, 1, 17, 771511) In this strait and narrow observance of this religion of ahimsa one has often to know so called himsa as the truest form of ahimsa.
('36', 391, 1, 18, 771643) Things in this world are not what they seem and do not seem as they really are.
('36', 391, 1, 19, 771723) Or if they are seen as they are, they so appear only to a few who have perfected themselves after ages of penance.
('36', 391, 1, 20, 771838) But none has yet been able to describe the reality, and no one, can.

('36', 392, 8, 14, 772699) DEAR FRIEND, You will not misunderstand me for telling you that I must not send you any message for your forthcoming paper.
('36', 392, 8, 15, 772823) 1 The increasing bitterness has made me sad.
('36', 392, 8, 16, 772868) Multiplication of newspapers multiplies bitterness.
('36', 392, 8, 17, 772920) Of late, therefore, I have ceased to send messages to newspapers, especially new ones.
('36', 392, 8, 18, 773007) I refused only two weeks ago to send a message of simple good wishes to Dr. Satyapal on his enterprise.
('36', 392, 8, 19, 773111) 2 I did likewise for a nationalist weekly in U.P. 3 If I could I would dissuade you from your enterprise at this juncture and feel that I had done a true friend’s duty.

('36', 394, 3, 4, 775189) This is my last testament, and by this I revoke all wills executed by me heretofore.
('36', 394, 3, 5, 775274) I do not possess any property of my own.
('36', 394, 3, 6, 775315) If, after my death, any article is found to be of my ownership, I bequeath the same to the Trustees of the Satyagraha Ashram, namely, Shri R. J. Jhaveri 1, B. Jamnlalji 2, M. H. Desai 3, I. A. K. Bawazeer 4 and C. K. Gandhi 5, or the Trustees of the said Satyagraha Ashram at the time of my demise and thereafter to the Trustees thereof from time to time as my heirs.
('36', 394, 3, 7, 775683) I also bequeath to the aforesaid Trustees all my rights in whatever books and whatever articles I have written or I may write hereafter, and also appoint them to administer my affairs after my death if and when necessary.
('36', 394, 3, 8, 775905) The income derived from the said books and articles or from the copyrights thereof and the property found to be of my ownership is to be used for carrying out the objects of the Satyagraha Ashram according to their discretion.
('36', 394, 3, 9, 776132) If any of the afore mentioned Trustees resigns or dies during my lifetime or after my death, the surviving Trustees may carry on the duties under this Will and can appoint a new Trustee to fill up the vacancy if they so desire.

('36', 396, 5, 10, 778350) 458. RACE ARROGANCE
('36', 396, 6, 11, 778370) A German correspondent who is interested in obliterating race distinctions sends me an article showing the wrong done by white Europe to the Abyssinians and the Riffs and the injustice that is being daily perpetrated against the Negro in the United States of America in the name of and for the sake of maintaining white superiority.
('36', 396, 6, 12, 778703) From the article, I cull the following three instances:
('36', 396, 7, 13, 778759) There were Christian clergymen the other day voyaging to the”Holy Land”.
('36', 396, 7, 14, 778832) A clergyman from the Southern States announced himself.
('36', 396, 7, 15, 778888) His white fellow clergymen would not let him travel with them.
('36', 396, 7, 16, 778951) The passage was refunded and compensation was paid and thus they got rid of the”coloured man”.
('36', 396, 8, 17, 779046) In South Carolina (U.S.A.) a white man stole a motor car.
('36', 396, 8, 18, 779104) He got four weeks.
('36', 396, 8, 19, 779123) The same Court of Justice condemned a Negro to three years’ penal servitude for stealing a bicyle.
('36', 396, 8, 20, 779222) A Delaware (U.S.A.)”coloured” man was sentenced to death for committing rape on a white girl.
('36', 396, 8, 21, 779316) At Alabama (U.S.A.) two whites were fined $.
('36', 396, 8, 22, 779361) 250 each for committing rape on coloured girls.
('36', 396, 8, 23, 779409) If the white man is cursed with the pride of race, we are cursed with the pride of birth.
('36', 396, 8, 24, 779499) Our treatment of the so called untouchablesis no better than that of coloured people by the white man.
('36', 396, 8, 25, 779602) I have cited the examples to show that the material achievements of the West have made no material difference in their morality—the final test of any civilization.

('36', 397, 2, 3, 779849) I gladly publish this catechism 1. But I must not enter into a long reply even though I should fail to satisfy the able catechist.
('36', 397, 2, 4, 779980) 1. What I have pleaded for is that parents who commit the sin of”marrying” their daughters of tender age should expiate for the sin by remarrying these daughters, should they become widowed while they are yet in their teens.
('36', 397, 2, 5, 780205) 2 If the girls become widowed at a ripe age, it is their concern whether they would remarry or remain widowed.
('36', 397, 2, 6, 780316) If I were called upon to state what the rule should be,.
('36', 397, 2, 7, 780373) I should say the same rule should apply to women as to men.
('36', 397, 2, 8, 780433) If a fifty year old widower may remarry with impunity, it should be open to the widow of that age to do likewise.
('36', 397, 2, 9, 780547) That in my opinion both will be sinning by remarriage is quite another matter.
('36', 397, 2, 10, 780626) I should any day subscribe to a reform in the Hindu law making sinful the remarriage of a widow or a widower who voluntarily married after maturity.
('36', 397, 2, 11, 780775) 2. All I have advocated is abolition of the fifth varna.
('36', 397, 2, 12, 780832) 3 The untouchables should, therefore, merge in the fourth division.
('36', 397, 2, 13, 780900) The reorganization of the four divisions, the abolition of artificial inequalities and of subdivisions is a separate branch of reform.
('36', 397, 2, 14, 781035) Interdining means dining off the same plate.
('36', 397, 2, 15, 781080) If I eat a biscuit cooked by Vishnu, Solomon, Ismail and Company, I do not interdine.
('36', 397, 2, 16, 781166) 3. I call myself a sanatani Hindu 4, because I believe in the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Puranas and the writings left by the holy reformers.
('36', 397, 2, 17, 781308) This belief does not require me to accept as authentic everything that passes as Shastras.
('36', 397, 2, 18, 781399) I reject everything that contradicts the fundamental principles of morality.
('36', 397, 2, 19, 781476) I am not required to accept the ipse dixit or the interpretations of pundits.
('36', 397, 2, 20, 781554) Above all I call myself

('36', 397, 3, 22, 781601) This was a long letter by an”Assistant Executive Engineer” raising four basic issues.
('36', 397, 3, 23, 781687) 2 The correspondent, referring to Gandhiji’s article”Supressed Humanity”, 19 8 1926, had asked what his prescription would be for widows of 15 years of age or above.
('36', 397, 3, 24, 781853) 3 The correspondent had sought to know why caste reform should not involve inter dining.
('36', 397, 3, 25, 781942) 4 The correspondent had asked, citing what Gandhiji had written in”Curse of Child Marriage”, 26 8 1926, why he termed himself a”Hindu” and at the same time denied the authority of the Shastras.
('36', 397, 3, 26, 782136) The correspondent had charged Gandhiji, in the light of his articles”Defending Child Marriage”, 9 9 1926 and”The Hydra headed Monster”, 29 7 1926, with intolerance of which Gandhiji had considered Swami Dayanand and the Arya Samajists guilty.

('36', 398, 1, 3, 782498) In a concrete manner he is a Hindu who believes in God, immortality of the soul, transmigration, the law of Karma and moksha, and who tries to practise truth and ahimsa in daily life, and therefore practises cow protection in its widest sense and understands and tries to act according to the law of varnashrama.

('36', 398, 3, 6, 782894) 460. TYRANNY OF WORDS
('36', 398, 4, 7, 782916) A correspondent thus writes on my article”No Faith in Prayer” published in Young India dated September 23rd:
('36', 398, 5, 8, 783025) In your article bearing the above caption you hardly do justice to the”boy” or to your own position as a great thinker.
('36', 398, 5, 9, 783145) It is true that the expressions used by the writer in his letter are not all happy but of his clarity of thought there is no doubt.
('36', 398, 5, 10, 783277) It is also very evident that he is not a boy as the
('36', 398, 6, 11, 783329) word is understood.
('36', 398, 6, 12, 783349) I should be much surprised to find him under twenty.
('36', 398, 6, 13, 783402) Even if he is young he seems to show sufficient intellectual development not to be treated in the manner of”A boy may not argue”.
('36', 398, 6, 14, 783532) The writer of the letter is a rationalist while you are a believer, two age old types, with age old conflict.
('36', 398, 6, 15, 783642) The attitude of the one is, ‘Let me be convinced and I shall believe’, that of the other is, ‘Believe and conviction shall come’.
('36', 398, 6, 16, 783772) The first appeals to reason, the second appeals to authority.
('36', 398, 6, 17, 783834) You seem to thank that agnosticism is but a passing phase among all young people and that faith comes to them sooner or later.
('36', 398, 6, 18, 783961) There is the well known case of Swami Vivekanandato support your view.
('36', 398, 6, 19, 784032) You therefore proceed to prescribe a compulsory dose of prayer to the”boy” for his own good.
('36', 398, 6, 20, 784125) Your reasons are twofold.
('36', 398, 6, 21, 784151) Firstly, prayer for its
('36', 398, 7, 22, 784175) own sake, as a recognition of one’s own littleness, and mightiness and goodness of the supposed higher being; Secondly, for its utility, for the solace
('36', 398, 8, 23, 784327) it bring to those who want to be solaced.
('36', 398, 8, 24, 784369) l shall dispose of the second argu ment first.
('36', 398, 8, 25, 784416) Here it is recommended as a sort of staff to the weak.
('36', 398, 8, 26, 784471) Such are the trials of life, and such is their power to shatter the reason of men that a great many people may need prayer and faith sometimes.
('36', 398, 8, 27, 784615) They have a right to it and they are welcome to it.
('36', 398, 8, 28, 784667) But there have been and there are always some true rationalists—few no doubt—who have never felt the necessity of either.
('36', 398, 8, 29, 784789) There is also the class of people who while they are not aggressive doubters are

('36', 399, 0, 1, 784878) 400 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 399, 1, 2, 784920) indifferent to religion.
('36', 399, 1, 3, 784945) As all people do not ultimately require the help of prayer and as those who feel its necessity are free to take to it and do take to it, when required,
('36', 399, 2, 4, 785097) compulsion in prayer from the point of utility cannot be upheld.
('36', 399, 2, 5, 785162) Compulsory physical exercise and education may be necessary for physical and mental development of a person, not so the belief in God and prayer for the moral side.
('36', 399, 2, 6, 785327) Some of the world’s greatest agnostics have been the most moral men.
('36', 399, 2, 7, 785396) To these I suppose you would recommend prayer for its own sake, as an expression of humility, in fact your first argument.
('36', 399, 2, 8, 785519) Too much has been made of this humility.
('36', 399, 2, 9, 785560) So vast is knowledge that even the greatest scientists have felt humble sometimes, but their general trait has been that of masterful
('36', 399, 3, 10, 785694) inquiry, their faith in their own powers has been as great as their conquests of nature.
('36', 399, 3, 11, 785783) Had it not been so we should still be scratching earth with bare fingers for roots, nay, we should have been wiped the surface of the earth.
('36', 399, 3, 12, 785924) During the Ice Age when human beings were dying of cold and when fire was first discovered, your prototype in that age must have taunted the discoverer with ‘What is the use of your schemes, of what avail are they against the power and wrath of God?’ The humble have been promised the Kingdom of God hereafter.
('36', 399, 3, 13, 786235) We do not know whether they will get it, but there on this earth their portion is serfdom.
('36', 399, 3, 14, 786326) To revert to the main point, your assertion about”accept the belief and the faith shall come” is too true, terribly true.
('36', 399, 3, 15, 786448) Much of the religious fanaticism of this world can be traced directly to the kind of teaching.
('36', 399, 3, 16, 786543) Provided you catch them young enough, and keep at them repeatedly and long enough, you can make a good majority of human beings believe in anything.
('36', 399, 3, 17, 786692) That is how your orthodox Hindu or fanatical
('36', 399, 4, 18, 786737) Mahommedan is manufactured.
('36', 399, 4, 19, 786765) There are of course always a small few in either community who will outgrow these beliefs that have been forced upon them.
('36', 399, 4, 20, 786888) Do you know that if the Hindus and the Mahommedans stopped studying their scriptures until they reached maturity, they would not be such fanatical believers in their dogmas and would cease to quarrel for their sake?
('36', 399, 4, 21, 787104) Secular education is the remedy for the Hindu Muslim riots, but you will not be able to appreciate the solution, for you are not made that way.
('36', 399, 4, 22, 787248) Great as our debt is to you for setting an unprecedented example in courage, action and sacrifice in this country, where people have been always much afraid, when the final judgment is passed on your work it will be said that
('36', 399, 5, 23, 787474) your influence gave a great setback to intellectual progress in this country.
('36', 399, 5, 24, 787552) I do not know the meaning of boy”as the word is ordinarily understood”, if a 20 year old lad is not a boy.
('36', 399, 5, 25, 787659) Indeed I would call all school going persons boys and girls, irrespective of their ages.
('36', 399, 5, 26, 787748) But whether the doubting student may be called a boy or a man, my

('36', 400, 1, 2, 787859) argument must stand.
('36', 400, 1, 3, 787880) A student is like a soldier (and a soldier may be 40 years old) who may not argue about matters of discipline when he has put himself and chooses to remain under it.
('36', 400, 1, 4, 788046) A soldier may not remain a unit in his regiment and have the option of doing or not doing things he is asked to do.
('36', 400, 1, 5, 788162) Similarly a student, no matter how wise or old he is, surrenders when he joins a school or a college the right of rejecting its discipline.
('36', 400, 1, 6, 788302) Here there is no underrating or despising the intelligence of the student.
('36', 400, 1, 7, 788377) It is an aid to his intelligence for him to come voluntarily under discipline.
('36', 400, 1, 8, 788456) But my correspondent willingly bears the heavy yoke of the tyranny of words.
('36', 400, 1, 9, 788533) He scents”compul sion” in every act that displeases the doer.
('36', 400, 1, 10, 788595) But there is compulsion and compulsion.
('36', 400, 1, 11, 788635) We call self imposed compulsion self restraint.
('36', 400, 1, 12, 788683) We hug it and grow under it.
('36', 400, 1, 13, 788712) But compulsion to be shunned even at the cost of life is restraint superimposed upon us against our wills and often with the object of humiliating us and robbing us of our dignity as men and boys if you will.
('36', 400, 1, 14, 788921) Social restraints generally are healthy and we reject them to our own undoing.
('36', 400, 1, 15, 789000) Submission to crawling orders is unmanly and cowardly.
('36', 400, 1, 16, 789055) Worse still is submission to the multitude of passions that crowd round us every moment of our lives ready to hold us their slaves.
('36', 400, 1, 17, 789187) But the correspondent has yet another word that holds him in its chains.
('36', 400, 1, 18, 789260) It is the mighty word”rationalism”.
('36', 400, 1, 19, 789296) Well, I had a full dose of it.
('36', 400, 1, 20, 789327) Experience has humbled me enough to let me realize the specific limitations of reason.
('36', 400, 1, 21, 789414) Just as matter misplaced becomes dirt, reason misused becomes lunacy.
('36', 400, 1, 22, 789484) If we would but render unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s, all would be well.
('36', 400, 1, 23, 789562) Rationalists are admirable beings, rationalism is a hideous monster when it claims for itself omnipotence.
('36', 400, 1, 24, 789669) Attribution of omnipotence to reason is as bad a piece of idolatry as is worship of stock and stone believing it to be God.
('36', 400, 1, 25, 789793) Who has reasoned out the use of prayer?
('36', 400, 1, 26, 789833) Its use is felt after practice.
('36', 400, 1, 27, 789865) Such is the world’s testimony.
('36', 400, 1, 28, 789896) Cardinal Newman never surrendered his reason, but he yielded a better place to prayer when he humbly sang”one step enough for me”.
('36', 400, 1, 29, 790027) Sankara was a prince among reasoners.
('36', 400, 1, 30, 790065) There is hardly anything in the world’s literature to surpass Sankara’s rationalism.
('36', 400, 1, 31, 790150) But he yielded the first place to prayer and faith.
('36', 400, 1, 32, 790202) The correspondent has made a hasty generalization from the fleeting and disturbing events that are happening before us.
('36', 400, 1, 33, 790322) But everything on this earth lends itself to abuse.
('36', 400, 1, 34, 790374) It seems to be a law

('36', 401, 1, 2, 790437) governing everything pertaining to man.
('36', 401, 1, 3, 790477) No doubt religion has to answer for some of the most terrible crimes in history.
('36', 401, 1, 4, 790558) But that is the fault not of religion but of the ungovernable brute in man.
('36', 401, 1, 5, 790634) He has not yet shed the effects of his brute ancestry.
('36', 401, 1, 6, 790689) I do not know a single rationalist who has never done anything in simple faith and has based every one of his acts on reason.
('36', 401, 1, 7, 790815) But we all know millions of human beings living their more or less orderly lives because of their childlike faith in the Maker of us all.
('36', 401, 1, 8, 790953) That very faith is a prayer.
('36', 401, 1, 9, 790982) The”boy” on whose letter I based my article belongs to that vast mass of humanity and the article was written to steady him and his fellow searchers, not to disturb the happiness of rationalists like the correspondent.
('36', 401, 1, 10, 791201) But he quarrels even with the bent that is given to the youth of the world by their elders and teachers.
('36', 401, 1, 11, 791306) But that it seems is an inseparable handicap (if it be one) of impressionable age.
('36', 401, 1, 12, 791389) Purely secular education is also an attempt to mould the young mind after a fashion.
('36', 401, 1, 13, 791474) The correspondent is good enough to grant that the body and the mind may be trained and directed.
('36', 401, 1, 14, 791572) Of the soul which makes the body and the mind possible, he has no care, or perhaps he is in doubt as to its existence.
('36', 401, 1, 15, 791691) But his disbelief cannot avail him.
('36', 401, 1, 16, 791727) He cannot escape the consequence of his reasoning.
('36', 401, 1, 17, 791778) For, why may not a believer argue on the correspondent’s own ground and say he must influence the soul of boys and girls even as the others influence the body and the intelligence?
('36', 401, 1, 18, 791959) The evils of religious instruction will vanish with the evolution of the true religious spirit.
('36', 401, 1, 19, 792055) To give up religious instruction is like letting a field lie fallow and grow weeds for want of the tiller’s knowledge of the proper use of the field.
('36', 401, 1, 20, 792205) The correspondent’s excursion into the great discoveries of the ancients is really irrelevant to the subject under discussion.
('36', 401, 1, 21, 792332) No one questions, I do not, the utility or the brilliance of those discoveries.
('36', 401, 1, 22, 792412) They were generally a proper field for the use and exercise of reason.
('36', 401, 1, 23, 792483) But they, the ancients, did not delete from their lives the predominant function of faith and prayer.
('36', 401, 1, 24, 792585) Works without faith and prayer are like an artificial flower that has no fragrance.
('36', 401, 1, 25, 792669) I plead not for the suppression of reason, but for a due recognition of that in us which sanctifies reason itself.

('36', 402, 3, 4, 793039) There should be no delay about introducing carding in the school.
('36', 402, 3, 5, 793105) 2 No boy or girl can be regarded a full spinner unless he or she can card and make slivers.
('36', 402, 3, 6, 793197) There is no reason why the schoolmasters should not card for their pupils till the latter have learnt it themselves.
('36', 402, 3, 7, 793314) National school teachers may not regard themselves as mere paid employees.
('36', 402, 3, 8, 793389) They are trustees for the moral and mental and physical welfare of the pupils as well as for national finances.

('36', 402, 7, 13, 793699) Ahmednagar in Maharashtra has also had a successful exhibition.
('36', 402, 7, 14, 793763) This was held between 11th and 19th September.
('36', 402, 7, 15, 793810) The report before me states that it was attended by Seth JamnalalBajaj and Messrs B. G. Horniman, Khadilkar, Jamnadas Mehta, V. V. Dastane, C. V. Vaidya, Shankerrao Lavate, Vamanrao Joshi, and Dr. Sathe among others.
('36', 402, 7, 16, 794027) The attendance was nearly ten thousand and included all classes.
('36', 402, 7, 17, 794092) The cash sales amounted to over Rs. 4,000.

('36', 402, 10, 20, 794193) The head master of Dondaicha school inquires whether there is an improvised method of testing the strength and the count of yarn.
('36', 402, 11, 21, 794323) 1 The report, not given here, furnished details of production of yarn by the pupils and the accounts of the takli class.
('36', 402, 12, 22, 794444) 2 The report had said:”Carding will be taken in hand after one month, when agricultural pursuits of boys are over.” 3 The report, not reproduced here, was of the exhibition organized by the Bihar Provincial Khadi Department between September 15 and 23. It gave a gist of the speech by F. C. Temple, who had presided over the inaugural function.
('36', 402, 12, 23, 794789) It was attended, among others, by Rajendra Prasad .
('36', 403, 0, 1, 794841) 404 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 403, 1, 2, 794883) Here is a recipe:
('36', 403, 2, 3, 794901) Take from the yarn at random 4 yards and make a reel two feet in circumference.
('36', 403, 2, 4, 794981) This will be one foot in length and hang it stretched to a peg so as not to get untwisted.
('36', 403, 2, 5, 795072) Hang at the other end regulated weights.
('36', 403, 2, 6, 795113) You are ready to measure the test when the strand snaps by the weight.
('36', 403, 3, 7, 795184) Weigh the broken strand in a fine scale.
('36', 403, 3, 8, 795225) Now one tola is 100 ratis.
('36', 403, 3, 9, 795252) If the reel weighs approximately 18_ ratis the yarn is count 1. If the reel weighs less the fraction of 18 ratis will be the count of yarn.
('36', 403, 3, 10, 795392) Thus if the 4 yards weigh 3 ratis, since 3 ratis is 1/6th of 18, the count is 6. In the absence of fine scales and very small weights, the strands may be more yards, where a waste of yarn is not of much consequence.
('36', 403, 3, 11, 795608) (Broken yarn may be used for making wicks, etc.) The convenient length is 21 yards and its multiples, 42, 84. The following table should be memorized: 7000 grains = 1 lb.
('36', 403, 3, 12, 795779) = 38 8/9 tolas 180 grains = 1 tola 840 yards yarn = 1 lease.
('36', 403, 3, 13, 795840) Therefore: 7000 grains Weight of hank of 840 yards = Count.
('36', 403, 3, 14, 795900) (in grains) Or 38 8/9 tolas Weight of hank in tolas = Count.
('36', 403, 4, 15, 795961) Or Yards X 10 Tolas X 216 = Count.
('36', 403, 5, 16, 795996) To arrive at the test remember:
('36', 403, 6, 17, 796028) 315 tolas X length =100 test.
('36', 403, 8, 18, 796058) One round = 2 lengths.
('36', 403, 9, 19, 796081) To find the unevenness of a given quantity of yarn made up into strands:
('36', 403, 10, 20, 796154) Find the counts of six strands selected anyhow from your hank.
('36', 403, 11, 21, 796217) Total the counts and divide by six.
('36', 403, 11, 22, 796253) You have the average count.
('36', 404, 0, 1, 796281) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 405
('36', 404, 1, 2, 796326) Take the difference between the highest and the lowest counts.
('36', 404, 1, 3, 796389) Then The difference X 100 = unevenness p.c.
('36', 404, 1, 4, 796433) the average Deduct the unevenness percentage from 100 and you have the percentage of evenness.
('36', 404, 1, 5, 796528) Thus if six strands show respectively 16, 18, 15, 20, 22, and 17 counts, the total is 108; 108 = 18. 6 Now the lowest count is 15 and the highest is 22. The difference is 7. Therefore 7 X 100 = 39 nearly unevenness.
('36', 404, 1, 6, 796744) 18 Therefore 100 39 = 61 evenness.

('36', 406, 16, 21, 799597) I am silent for overtaking arrears.
('36', 406, 16, 22, 799633) I did not think of glycerine being an animal product though now that you mention it, I see I knew the thing.
('36', 406, 16, 23, 799742) But although it is an animal product, you should continue to use it to paint the tonsils.
('36', 406, 16, 24, 799832) Applying is not the same thing as eating.

('36', 407, 1, 2, 799916) You probably use soap that contains animal fat, but you will not eat it.
('36', 407, 1, 3, 799989) More, however, later.
('36', 407, 1, 4, 800011) I hope you will not disturb yourself over the matter.

('36', 407, 4, 8, 800183) DEAR FRIEND, With reference to your letter, I have now got a detailed reply from Jamnalalji from which I gather that you wrote to him letters of confession and apology for having caused him much worry and trouble.
('36', 407, 4, 9, 800397) So far as I can see, Jamnalalji has gone out of his way to placate you.
('36', 407, 4, 10, 800469) And the arbitration, which was of your choice, decided against you.
('36', 407, 4, 11, 800537) Jamnalalji further tells me he has had no correspondence or other communication with Dr. Mehta with reference to you.
('36', 407, 4, 12, 800655) Nothing, therefore, remains to be done by me.

('36', 407, 8, 21, 801062) 2 The enclosures to Mukherjee’s letter of October 12, 1926, consisted of the copy of a letter dated September 15, 1926 from Dr. Karl Thieme of Leipzig, addressed to Krishnadas, a typescript copy of”A Quarker View of Non co operation” by A. Barrett Brown, Principal, Ruskin College, and the press cutting of a letter from Miss Lilian Edger to The Statesman, 3 10 1926,”which,” Mukherjee wrote,”has appealed to me and may just interest you” (S.N. 11004).

('36', 408, 1, 3, 801664) Of course, the Hindu Muslim problem is becoming more and more complicated.
('36', 408, 1, 4, 801739) 1 But what is one to do where one is helpless?
('36', 408, 1, 5, 801786) I am an optimist because I believe in the efficacy of prayerful thought.
('36', 408, 1, 6, 801859) When time for action has come, God will give the light and guidance.
('36', 408, 1, 7, 801928) I therefore watch, wait and pray holding myself in momentary readiness to respond.
('36', 408, 1, 8, 802011) The cutting that Miss Lilian Edger has sent you is interesting as also the extracts from”No More War”.
('36', 408, 1, 9, 802114) I hope to make use of both in Young India.
('36', 408, 1, 10, 802157) Lord Oxford’s article, I have not yet read.
('36', 408, 1, 11, 802201) You have said nothing, in your own fashion, about your health.

('36', 408, 1, 13, 802347) There is no prospect now of Romaine Rolland coming to India at all; 2

('36', 409, 2, 3, 803003) [October 17, 1926]
('36', 409, 3, 4, 803022) When I wrote the article on this subject I knew that I was adding one more to my already heavy burden of troubles.
('36', 409, 3, 5, 803137) But it could not be helped.
('36', 409, 3, 6, 803165) Angry letters are now pouring in.
('36', 409, 3, 7, 803199) At an hour when after a hard day’s work I was about to retire to bed, three friends invaded me, infringed the religion of ahimsa in the name of humanity, and engaged me in a discussion on it.
('36', 409, 3, 8, 803391) They had come in the name of humanity.
('36', 409, 3, 9, 803430) How could I refuse to see them?
('36', 409, 3, 10, 803462) So I met them.
('36', 409, 3, 11, 803477) One of them, I saw, betrayed anger, bitterness and arrogance.
('36', 409, 3, 12, 803539) He did not seem to me to have come with a view to getting his doubts solved.
('36', 409, 3, 13, 803616) He had come rather to correct me.
('36', 409, 3, 14, 803650) Everyone has a right to do so, but whoever undertakes such a mission must know my position.
('36', 409, 3, 15, 803742) This friend had taken no trouble to understand my position.
('36', 409, 3, 16, 803802) But he was not to blame for it.
('36', 409, 3, 17, 803834) This impatience which is but a symptom of violence is to be found everywhere.
('36', 409, 3, 18, 803912) The violence in this case was painful to me as it was betrayed by an advocate of non violence.
('36', 409, 3, 19, 804007) He claimed to be a Jain.
('36', 409, 3, 20, 804032) I have made a fair study of Jainism.
('36', 409, 3, 21, 804069) This visitor’s ahimsa was a distortion of the reality as I have known it in Jainism.
('36', 409, 3, 22, 804154) But the Jains have no monopoly of ahimsa.
('36', 409, 3, 23, 804196) It is not the exclusive peculiarity of any religion.
('36', 409, 3, 24, 804249) Every religion is based on ahimsa, its application is different in different religions.
('36', 409, 3, 25, 804337) I do not think that the Jains of today practise ahimsa in any better way than others.
('36', 409, 3, 26, 804423) I can say this because of my acquaintance with Jains, which is so old that many take me to be a Jain.
('36', 409, 3, 27, 804525) Mahavir was an incarnation of compassion, of ahimsa.
('36', 409, 3, 28, 804578) How I wish his votaries were votaries also of his ahimsa!
('36', 409, 3, 29, 804636) Protection of little creatures is indeed an essential part of ahimsa, but it does not exhaust itself with it.
('36', 409, 3, 30, 804746) Ahimsa begins with it.
('36', 409, 3, 31, 804769) Besides protection may not always mean mere refraining from killing.
('36', 409, 3, 32, 804838) Torture or participation, direct or indirect, in the unnecessary multiplication of those that must die is himsa The multiplication of dogs is unnecessary.
('36', 409, 3, 33, 804993) A roving dog without an owner is a danger to society and a swarm of them is a menace to its very existence.
('36', 410, 0, 1, 805101) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 411
('36', 410, 1, 2, 805146) If we want to keep dogs in towns or villages in a decent manner, no dog should be suffered to wander.
('36', 410, 1, 3, 805248) There should be no stray dogs even as we have no stray cattle.
('36', 410, 1, 4, 805311) Humanitarian societies should find a religious solution of such questions.
('36', 410, 1, 5, 805386) But can we take individual charge of these roving dogs?
('36', 410, 1, 6, 805442) And if we cannot, can we have a pinjarapole for them?
('36', 410, 1, 7, 805496) If both these things are impossible, there seems to me to be no alternative except to kill them.
('36', 410, 1, 8, 805593) Connivance or putting up with the status quo is no ahimsa, there is no thought or discrimination in it.
('36', 410, 1, 9, 805697) Dogs will be killed whenever they are a menace to society.
('36', 410, 1, 10, 805756) I regard this as unavoidable in the life of a householder.
('36', 410, 1, 11, 805815) To wait until they get rabid is not to be merciful to them.
('36', 410, 1, 12, 805875) We can imagine what the dogs would wish if a meeting could be called of them, from what we would wish under the same circumstances.
('36', 410, 1, 13, 806007) We will not choose to live anyhow.
('36', 410, 1, 14, 806042) That many of us do so is no credit to us.
('36', 410, 1, 15, 806084) A meeting of wise men will never resolve that men may treat one another as they treat rabid or stray dogs.
('36', 410, 1, 16, 806191) What shall we expect of them if there were to be some beings loasing it over us as we do over dogs?
('36', 410, 1, 17, 806291) Would we not rather prefer to be killed than to be treated as dogs?
('36', 410, 1, 18, 806359) We offend against dogs as a class by suffering them to stray and live on crumbs or savings from our plates that we throw at them and we injure our neighbours also by doing so.
('36', 410, 1, 19, 806535) I admit that there is the duty of suffering dogs to live even at the cost of one’s life.
('36', 410, 1, 20, 806624) But that religion is not for the householder who desires to live, who procreates, who would protect society.
('36', 410, 1, 21, 806733) The householder can but practise the middle path of taking care of a few dogs.
('36', 410, 1, 22, 806812) Our domestics of today are the wild animals of yesterday.
('36', 410, 1, 23, 806870) The buffalo is a domestic only in India.
('36', 410, 1, 24, 806911) It is a sin to domesticate wild animals inasmuch as man does so for his selfish purposes.
('36', 410, 1, 25, 807001) That he has domesticated the cow and the buffalo is not out of mercy for them, it is for his own use.
('36', 410, 1, 26, 807103) He, therefore, does not allow a cow or a buffalo to stray.
('36', 410, 1, 27, 807162) The same duty is incumbent regarding dogs.
('36', 410, 1, 28, 807205) I am, therefore, strongly of opinion that, if we would practise the religion of humanity, we should have a law making it obligatory on those who would have dogs to keep them under guard, and not allow them to stray, and making all the stray dogs liable to be destroyed after a certain date.
('36', 410, 1, 29, 807496) If the mahajan has really any mercy for the dogs, it should take possession of all the stray dogs and distribute them to those who want
('36', 411, 0, 1, 807632) 412 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 411, 1, 2, 807674) to keep them.
('36', 411, 1, 3, 807688) It seems to me to be impossible to protect dogs as we can protect the cows.
('36', 411, 1, 4, 807764) But there is a regular science of dog keeping which the people in the West have formulated and perfected.
('36', 411, 1, 5, 807870) We should learn it from them and devise measures for the solution of our own problem.
('36', 411, 1, 6, 807956) The work cannot be done without patience, wisdom and perseverance.
('36', 411, 1, 7, 808023) So much about dogs.
('36', 411, 1, 8, 808043) But with ahimsa in its comprehensive aspect I propose to deal on another occasion.

('36', 411, 5, 13, 808289) This is not good.
('36', 411, 5, 14, 808307) It must improve, even if that means your going away somewhere.
('36', 411, 5, 15, 808370) You should go to a place where you can live in solitude.
('36', 411, 5, 16, 808427) The air should be wholesome, and you should have the right kind of companion with you.
('36', 411, 5, 17, 808514) Your illness is both physical and mental.
('36', 411, 5, 18, 808556) You ought not to carry an excessive burden of work.
('36', 411, 5, 19, 808608) You need not worry about Kamala.
('36', 411, 5, 20, 808641) Her fever is like that of the others.
('36', 411, 5, 21, 808679) She is in fact ready to go to Wardha or Bombay or any other place.
('36', 411, 5, 22, 808746) But I don’t feel like letting her go till she is quite all right, nor is it necessary that she should go.
('36', 411, 5, 23, 808852) I see her from time to time.
('36', 411, 5, 24, 808881) It is her mother in law about whom I feel worried, because she gets nervous, though, of course, she will certainly recover.
('36', 411, 5, 25, 809005) I hope you take regular walks.
('36', 411, 5, 26, 809036) You must go out both in the morning and in the evening.

('36', 412, 13, 15, 810076) Interviewed by a representative of the Associated Press on the personnel of the Indian delegation to the Round Table Conference to be held at Cape Town in December, Mahatma Gandhi said: I think the choice is carefully made.
('36', 412, 13, 16, 810300) I like the idea of Sir Mahomed Habibullah’s leading the deputation.
('36', 412, 13, 17, 810368) Mr. Corbett has intimate experience of the intricate question which the Delegation is to handle.
('36', 412, 13, 18, 810465) Sir Darcy Lindsay, as a representative of European commerce, should have great weight in South Africa.

('36', 412, 13, 20, 810652) He knows Colonial questions.
('36', 412, 13, 21, 810681) He knows South African statesmen, and who can question his learning and industry?
('36', 412, 13, 22, 810763) Sir Phiroze Sethna’s inclusion is not difficult to understand.
('36', 412, 13, 23, 810826) Sir George Paddison by his able work on the last deputation had made himself indispensable.

('36', 413, 1, 5, 811291) I am anxious that this delegation, imperfect and incomplete though it may appear to some of us, should receive the moral approbation of the public.
('36', 413, 1, 6, 811439) Things seem to have gone on smoothly up to now, and I am not without hope that the forthcoming Conference will give at least breathing time to the Indian settlers of South Africa as also to the Government of India if it does its duty to improve the status of the settlers.

('36', 413, 11, 23, 812388) They have just arrived from Natal and intend to visit the holy places.
('36', 413, 12, 24, 812459) Yours sincerely,
('36', 413, 13, 25, 812476) M. K. GANDHI

('36', 414, 1, 2, 812563) 480. TOUGH QUESTION
('36', 414, 2, 3, 812583) A fair friend who has some faith in my wisdom and sincerity asks some knotty questions which I would fain avoid for fear of raising an indignant controversy on the part of some husbands jealous of their rights.
('36', 414, 2, 4, 812794) But jealous husbands would spare me, for they know that I happen to be one myself having led a fairly happy married life for the past forty years in spite of occasional jars.
('36', 414, 3, 5, 812969) The first question is apposite and timely (The original is in Marathi.
('36', 414, 3, 6, 813040) I have given a free rendering.):
('36', 414, 4, 7, 813073) Can a man or woman attain self realization by mere recitation of Ramanama and without taking part in national service?
('36', 414, 4, 8, 813192) I ask this question because some of my sisters say that they do not need to do anything beyond attending to family requirements and occasionally showing kindness to the poor.
('36', 414, 5, 9, 813367) This question has puzzled not only women but many men and has taxed me to the utmost.
('36', 414, 5, 10, 813453) I know that there is a school of philosophy which teaches complete inaction and futility of all effort.
('36', 414, 5, 11, 813557) I have not been able to appreciate that teaching unless, in order to secure verbal agreement, I were to put my own interpretation on it.
('36', 414, 5, 12, 813694) In my humble opinion, effort is necessary for one’s own growth.
('36', 414, 5, 13, 813758) It has to be irrespective of results.
('36', 414, 5, 14, 813796) Ramanama or some equivalent is necessary not for the sake of repetition but for the sake of purification, as an aid to effort, for direct guidance from above.
('36', 414, 5, 15, 813955) It is, therefore, never a substitute for effort.
('36', 414, 5, 16, 814004) It is meant for intensifying and guiding it in proper channel.
('36', 414, 5, 17, 814067) If all effort is vain, why family cares or an occasional help to the poor?
('36', 414, 5, 18, 814142) In this very effort is contained the germ of national service.
('36', 414, 5, 19, 814205) And national service, to me, means service of humanity, even as disinterested service of the family means the same thing.
('36', 414, 5, 20, 814327) Disinterested service of the family necessarily leads one to national service.
('36', 414, 5, 21, 814406) Ramanama gives one detachment and ballast and never throws one off one’s balance at critical moments.
('36', 414, 5, 22, 814508) Self realization I hold to be impossible without service of and identification with the poorest.
('36', 414, 5, 23, 814605) The second question is:
('36', 414, 6, 24, 814629) In Hinduism devotion of wife to her husband and her complete merger in him is the highest aim, never mind whether the husband is a fiend or an embodiment of love.
('36', 414, 6, 25, 814792) If this be the correct conduct for a wife, may she in the teeth of opposition by
('36', 415, 0, 1, 814873) 416 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 415, 1, 2, 814915) her husband undertake national service?
('36', 415, 1, 3, 814955) Or must she only go as far as the husband will permit her to go?
('36', 415, 1, 4, 815020) My ideal of a wife is Sita and of a husband Rama.
('36', 415, 1, 5, 815070) But Sita was no slave of Rama.
('36', 415, 1, 6, 815101) Or each was slave of the other.
('36', 415, 1, 7, 815133) Rama is ever considerate to Sita.
('36', 415, 1, 8, 815167) Where there is true love, the question asked does not occur.
('36', 415, 1, 9, 815228) Where there is no true love, the bond has never existed.
('36', 415, 1, 10, 815285) But the Hindu household of today is a conundrum.
('36', 415, 1, 11, 815334) Husbands and wives when they are married know nothing of one another.
('36', 415, 1, 12, 815404) Religious sanction fortified by custom and the even flow of the lives of the married people keep the peace in the vast majority of Hindu households.
('36', 415, 1, 13, 815553) But when either wife or husband holds views out of the ordinary, there is danger of jars.
('36', 415, 1, 14, 815643) In the case of the husband he has no scruples.
('36', 415, 1, 15, 815690) He does not consider himself under any obligation to consult his partner’s wishes.
('36', 415, 1, 16, 815773) He regards his wife as his property.
('36', 415, 1, 17, 815810) And the poor wife who believes in the husband’s claim often suppresses herself.
('36', 415, 1, 18, 815890) I think there is a way out.
('36', 415, 1, 19, 815918) Mirabai has shown the way.
('36', 415, 1, 20, 815945) The wife has a perfect right to take her own course and meekly brave the consequences when she knows herself to be in the right and when her resistance is for a nobler purpose.
('36', 415, 1, 21, 816122) The third question is: If a husband is, say, a meat eater and the wife considers meat eating an evil, may she follow her own bent?
('36', 415, 1, 22, 816253) May she even try by all loving ways to wean her husband from meat eating or the like?
('36', 415, 1, 23, 816339) Or is she bound to cook meat for her husband or worse still, is she bound to eat it, if the husband requires her?
('36', 415, 1, 24, 816453) If you say that the wife may take her own course, how can a joint household be run when the one compels and the other rebels?
('36', 415, 1, 25, 816579) This question is partly answered in the answer to the second.
('36', 415, 1, 26, 816641) A wife is not bound to be an accomplice in her husband’s crimes.
('36', 415, 1, 27, 816706) And when she holds anything to be wrong, she must dare to do the right.
('36', 415, 1, 28, 816778) But, seeing that the wife’s function is to manage the household and thus to cook, as the husband’s is to earn for the family, she is bound to cook meat for the family if both have been meat eaters before.
('36', 415, 1, 29, 816983) If, on the other hand, in a vegetarian family, the husband becomes a meat eater and seeks to compel the wife to cook for him, the wife is in no way bound to cook what offends her sense of right.
('36', 415, 1, 30, 817178) The peace of a household is a most desirable thing.
('36', 415, 1, 31, 817230) But it cannot be an end in itself.
('36', 415, 1, 32, 817265) For me, the married state is as much a state of discipline as any other.
('36', 415, 1, 33, 817338) Life is duty, a probation.
('36', 415, 1, 34, 817365) Married life is intended to promote mutual good both here and hereafter.
('36', 415, 1, 35, 817438) It is meant also to serve humanity.
('36', 416, 0, 1, 817474) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 417
('36', 416, 1, 2, 817519) When one partner breaks the law of discipline, the right accrues to the other of breaking the bond.
('36', 416, 1, 3, 817619) The breach here is moral and not physical.
('36', 416, 1, 4, 817662) It precludes divorce.
('36', 416, 1, 5, 817684) The wife or the husband separates but to serve the end for which they had united.
('36', 416, 1, 6, 817766) Hinduism regards each as absolute equal of the other.
('36', 416, 1, 7, 817820) No doubt a different practice has grown up, no one knows since when.
('36', 416, 1, 8, 817889) But so have many other evils crept into it.
('36', 416, 1, 9, 817933) This, however, I do know that Hinduism leaves the individual absolutely free to do what he or she likes for the sake of self realization for which and which alone he or she is born.

('36', 416, 3, 11, 818139) 481. KNOTTY PROBLEMS OF NON VIOLENCE
('36', 416, 4, 12, 818176) The destruction of certain dogs by a millowner, when some of them were suffering from hydrophobia and when there was danger of the employees being bitten any moment has angered members of the very influential Jain community of Ahmedabad.
('36', 416, 4, 13, 818414) Having many friends among them and being regarded by many as an authority in matters of ahimsa (non violence), I have been helplessly and reluctantly drawn into the controversy.
('36', 416, 4, 14, 818592) As the matter has gone beyond the mere Gujarati speaking public of Ahmedabad, I am presenting the readers of Young India with a translation of the series of articles 1 I am devoting to the subject covering as far as possible the whole wide field of ahimsa.
('36', 416, 4, 15, 818849) I have no doubt that many readers of Young India who are interested in the theory and evolution of non violence will welcome the translation of the series.

('36', 416, 6, 17, 819029) 482. STAND FOR NON VIOLENCE
('36', 416, 7, 18, 819057) A friend sends me the following cutting from the New York Nation:
('36', 416, 8, 19, 819123) Some time ago (either in the latter part of 1924 or early in 1925) a band of twenty five American missionaries in China addressed the following appeal to the American Minister at Peking:
('36', 416, 9, 20, 819310) “The undersigned American missionaries are in China as messengers of the gospel of brotherhood and peace.
('36', 416, 9, 21, 819416) Our task is to lead men and women into a
('36', 416, 10, 22, 819457) 1 For the first article of the series, vide”Is This Humanity?

('36', 417, 0, 1, 819536) 418 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 417, 1, 2, 819578) new life in Christ, which promotes brotherhood and takes away all occasions of war.
('36', 417, 1, 3, 819662) We, therefore, express our earnest desire that no form of military pressure, especially no foreign military force, be exerted to protect us or our property; and that in the event of our capture by lawless persons or our death at their hands, no money be paid for our release, no punitive expedition be sent out, and no indemnities be exacted.
('36', 417, 1, 4, 820005) We take this stand believing that the way to establish righteousness and peace is through bringing the spirit of personal good will to bear on all persons under all circumstances, even through suffering wrong without retaliation.”
('36', 417, 2, 5, 820236) The American Legation, however, replied that this petition was inconsistent with the necessity that exists for safeguarding Americans in China, and that therefore, no exception could or would be made in the procedure in case of emergencies with regard to the signers of the petition.
('36', 417, 2, 6, 820520) This is one of those instances in which two apparently contradictory positions are right at the same time.
('36', 417, 2, 7, 820627) For the brave missionaries there was no other attitude possible, though, nowadays, very few adopt it.
('36', 417, 2, 8, 820729) Was it not about China that a missionary deputation some thirty years ago waited on the late Lord Salisbury and asked the protection of the British gunboats for carrying their message to the unwilling Chinese?
('36', 417, 2, 9, 820939) Then the late noble Marquess had to tell the missi onaries that, if they sought the protection of the British arms, they must submit to international obligations and curb their missionary ardour.
('36', 417, 2, 10, 821135) He reminded them that the Christians of old, if they pene trated the remotest regions of the earth, expected no protection save from God and put their lives in constant danger.
('36', 417, 2, 11, 821312) In the case quoted by the New York Nation, the missionaries according to the report have reverted to the ancient practice.
('36', 417, 3, 12, 821435) The American Government, however, so long as it retains its present character, can only give the answer they are reported to have given.
('36', 417, 3, 13, 821572) That the answer betrays the evil of the modern system is another matter.
('36', 417, 3, 14, 821645) The American prestige depends not upon its moral strength but upon force.
('36', 417, 3, 15, 821719) But why should the whole armed force of America be mobilized for the so called vindication of its honour or name?
('36', 417, 3, 16, 821833) What harm can accrue to the honour of America if twenty five missionaries choose to go to China uninvited for the sake of deliver ing their message and get killed in the act?
('36', 417, 3, 17, 822008) Probably, it would be the best thing for their mission.
('36', 417, 3, 18, 822064) The American Government by its inter ference could only interrupt the full working of the law of suffering.
('36', 417, 3, 19, 822172) But self restraint of America would mean a complete change of

('36', 418, 1, 2, 822279) outlook.
('36', 418, 1, 3, 822288) Today, defence of citizenship is a defence of national com merce, i.e., exploitation.
('36', 418, 1, 4, 822374) That exploitation presupposes the use of force for imposing commerce upon an unwilling people.
('36', 418, 1, 5, 822469) Nations have in a sense, therefore, almost become gangs of robbers, whereas they should be a peaceful combination of men and women united for the common good of mankind.
('36', 418, 1, 6, 822639) In the latter case, their strength will lie not in their skill in the use of gunpowder, but in the possession of superior moral fibre.
('36', 418, 1, 7, 822774) The action of the twenty five missionaries is a dim shadow of reconstructed society or even reconstructed nations.
('36', 418, 1, 8, 822889) I do not know whether they carried out their principle into practice in every department of life.
('36', 418, 1, 9, 822987) I need hardly point out that in spite of the threat of the American Government to protect them against themselves, they could neutralize, indeed even frustrate, any effort at retaliation.
('36', 418, 1, 10, 823175) But that means complete self effacement.
('36', 418, 1, 11, 823216) And if one is to combat the fetish of force, it will only be by means totally different from those in vogue among the pure worshippers of brute force.
('36', 418, 1, 12, 823367) It must not be forgotten that, after all, there is a philosophy behind the modern worship of brute force with a history to back it.
('36', 418, 1, 13, 823499) The microscopic non militant minority has, indeed, nothing to fear from it, if only it has immovable faith behind it.
('36', 418, 1, 14, 823617) But faith in the possibility of holding together society without brute force seems somehow to be lacking.
('36', 418, 1, 15, 823723) Yet, if one person can pit himself against the whole world, why cannot two or more do likewise together?
('36', 418, 1, 16, 823828) I know the answer that has been given.
('36', 418, 1, 17, 823867) Time alone can show the possibilities of the revolution that is silently creeping upon us.
('36', 418, 1, 18, 823958) Speculation is waste of effort where action is already afoot.
('36', 418, 1, 19, 824020) Those who have faith will join the initial effort in which demonstrable results cannot be shown.

('36', 418, 4, 22, 824167) At the instance of a friend, I had brief notes 1 prepared on khaddar economics.
('36', 418, 4, 23, 824247) The notes ran out into many sheets and involved a fair amount of labour.
('36', 418, 4, 24, 824320) But they were too comprehensive for the purpose intended.
('36', 418, 4, 25, 824378) They were, therefore, recast and condensed and almost rewritten.
('36', 418, 4, 26, 824443) Thus two helpers have laboured at these notes.
('36', 418, 4, 27, 824490) They present in a connected and readable form the economics of khaddar
('36', 418, 5, 28, 824561) 1 These were published in Young India, 21 10 1926 and 28 10 1926 under the title”Charkha as the Only Cottage Industry”.

('36', 419, 1, 4, 824886) The first appears this week.
('36', 419, 1, 5, 824915) The readers of Young India may not find anything new in them but they will find the scattered arguments compressed in a series of connected chapters and within a small compass.

('36', 419, 3, 7, 825109) I hope the khadi workers have been carefully following the digest of Khadi statistics I have been publishing from time to time.
('36', 419, 3, 8, 825237) They are a valuable record and give us an indication of the progress and possibilities of Khadi that nothing else can.
('36', 419, 3, 9, 825356) I do hope that those who have not yet sent them will kindly furnish the information at the earliest opportunity.

('36', 419, 6, 12, 825504) THE INDIAN DELEGATION
('36', 419, 7, 13, 825526) I have already expressed my opinion about Sir Mahomed Habibulla’s deputation.
('36', 419, 7, 14, 825604) It is a carefully made choice.
('36', 419, 7, 15, 825635) I am glad to find that it has been blessed by the public.
('36', 419, 7, 16, 825693) The question of the status of Indians overseas is perhaps the one question on which all parties are united.
('36', 419, 7, 17, 825801) Hindus, Mussalmans, Christians, Parsis, etc., speak with one voice.
('36', 419, 7, 18, 825869) European opinion coincides with the Indian.
('36', 419, 7, 19, 825913) The Government backs public opinion.
('36', 419, 7, 20, 825950) All this unity is needed if the cause of justice is to be vindicated.
('36', 419, 7, 21, 826020) This remarkable unanimity of opinion cannot but react upon South African opinion.
('36', 419, 7, 22, 826102) But this unity need not be confined to the question of the status of Indians abroad.
('36', 419, 7, 23, 826187) Is it too much to wish to extend it to other equally natural and pure causes?
('36', 419, 7, 24, 826265) Or is unity possible only on questions remote in space from the actors?
('36', 419, 7, 25, 826337) True unity comes of itself.
('36', 419, 7, 26, 826365) No attempt had to be made for achieving unity of opinion on the South African question.
('36', 419, 7, 27, 826453) All instinctively thought alike.
('36', 419, 7, 28, 826486) Unity on other matters will also come instinctively when its time has come.
('36', 419, 7, 29, 826562) I am optimistic enough to think that it is coming sooner than many of us expect or imagine.
('36', 419, 7, 30, 826654) But let us return to the deputation.
('36', 419, 7, 31, 826691) The settlers in South Africa have in Mr. C. F. Andrews a link between the deputation and
('36', 420, 0, 1, 826780) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 421
('36', 420, 1, 2, 826825) themselves as also between the Union Government and themselves.
('36', 420, 1, 3, 826889) Let them make the most of the opportunity that has presented itself to them.
('36', 420, 1, 4, 826966) They must unite all their forces.
('36', 420, 1, 5, 827000) The best workers among them should collect all the material and place it at Mr. Andrews’s disposal.
('36', 420, 1, 6, 827100) they should understand the limits of the deputation and they must be as firm in their presentation of their claim as one expects them to bemoderate.
('36', 420, 1, 7, 827249) Moderation, firmness and unity combined with absolute adherence to truth should make victory easily possible.
('36', 420, 2, 8, 827359) CONGRESS EXHIBITION Exhibitions used formerly to be a feature of the National Congress.
('36', 420, 2, 9, 827447) They had then ceased to be.
('36', 420, 2, 10, 827475) The fashion was revived in Ahmedabad and has been since continued with progressive improvement.
('36', 420, 2, 11, 827571) The central feature of these exhibitions has been khaddar with all the hand processes through which cotton passes before it comes out as khaddar.
('36', 420, 2, 12, 827717) The feature of these exhibitions has been the inclusion of only those things which have been manufactured in India from start to finish.
('36', 420, 2, 13, 827854) They have, therefore, excluded so called swadeshi watches or harmoniums whose every part was imported from outside.
('36', 420, 2, 14, 827970) They have also excluded all mill spun yarn and mill woven cloth.
('36', 420, 2, 15, 828035) These exhibitions are meant for the encouragement of those things which are neglected and which deserve encouragement.
('36', 420, 2, 16, 828154) No one will hold an exhibition for showing faggots of wood which everyone knows and uses.
('36', 420, 2, 17, 828244) But there would be an exhibition of wood that possessed extraordinary virtue which needed to be brought to the notice of the people.
('36', 420, 2, 18, 828377) Faggots of ordinary wood would be excluded not out of any jealousy of them but because attention would be divided between extraordinary wood needing advertisement and protection and the wood that had no such need.
('36', 420, 2, 19, 828591) I was, therefore, surprised when a correspondent drew my attention to the Assam Exhibition Committee having included in the exhibits cotton fabrics woven on power looms and out of mill spun yarn.
('36', 420, 2, 20, 828787) The description of the items does not exclude even foreign cloth or yarn.
('36', 420, 2, 21, 828861) I telegraphed to the Committee.
('36', 420, 2, 22, 828893) The reader will be glad to know that the Committee promptly replied 1 to the effect that the inclusion of mill spun etc., was due to a mistake and that it was being immediately corrected.
('36', 420, 2, 23, 829081) 2 I congratulate the Committee upon its admission and readiness to correct the error.
('36', 420, 2, 24, 829167) I may state that the description of other goods too is so loose and wide as to include almost every conceivable thing.

('36', 421, 5, 6, 829726) DEAR SATIS BABU, I have your letter after ages as it were.
('36', 421, 5, 7, 829785) I did suspect that you were not getting on as well as I had expected.
('36', 421, 5, 8, 829855) But whether I can help or not, you should share your sorrows with me.
('36', 421, 5, 9, 829925) If I know the best, I must know also the worst.
('36', 421, 5, 10, 829973) Do please, therefore, let me know what are the unexpected difficulties.

('36', 424, 2, 3, 833463) [October 24, 1926]
('36', 424, 3, 4, 833482) Whilst I admit the possibility of having made a mistake in giving the opinion that the destruction by Mr. Ambalal’s order of sixty dogs was unavoidable, I do not regret having expressed that opinion.
('36', 424, 3, 5, 833682) The result so far is all to the good.
('36', 424, 3, 6, 833720) We shall perhaps now understand more clearly our duty to such animals.
('36', 424, 3, 7, 833791) Much wrong has been done partly out of ignorance, partly from hypocrisy and partly for fear of public opinion.
('36', 424, 3, 8, 833902) All that should now cease.
('36', 424, 3, 9, 833929) But if the good is to be maintained, a clear understanding is necessary between the readers and myself.
('36', 424, 3, 10, 834033) I have received quite a pile of letters on the subject, some friendly, some sharp and some bitter.
('36', 424, 3, 11, 834132) They do not seem to have understood my attitude on the destruction of dogs by Mr. Ambalal.
('36', 424, 3, 12, 834223) I have often had the misfortune to be misunderstood.
('36', 424, 3, 13, 834276) In South Africa my life was in peril over an action which was quite consistent with my avowed principles but which, as was proved later, was rashly regarded as contrary to them.
('36', 424, 3, 14, 834454) 1 The so called”Himalayan blunder” of Bardoli is a recent memory.
('36', 424, 3, 15, 834520) The Bombay Government very kindly imprisoned me at Yeravda and saved me the trouble of much writing by way of explaining and clearing my position.
('36', 424, 3, 16, 834667) The Bardoli decision, I still hold, was not wrong.
('36', 424, 3, 17, 834718) It was, on the contrary, an act of purest ahimsa and of invaluable service to the country.
('36', 424, 3, 18, 834809) I feel just as clear about my opinion regarding the present question.
('36', 424, 3, 19, 834879) I hold that the opinion is perfectly in accord with my conception of ahimsa.
('36', 424, 3, 20, 834956) The critics, whether friendly or hostile, should bear with me.
('36', 424, 3, 21, 835019) Some of the hostile critics have transgressed the limits of decorum.
('36', 424, 3, 22, 835088) They have made no attempt to understand my position.
('36', 424, 3, 23, 835141) It seems they cannot for a moment tolerate my opinion.
('36', 424, 3, 24, 835196) Now they must be one of two things.
('36', 424, 3, 25, 835232) They are either my teachers or they regard me as one.
('36', 424, 3, 26, 835286) In the latter case, they should be courteous and patient and should have faith in me and ponder over what I write.
('36', 424, 3, 27, 835401) In the former case, they should be indulgent to me and try to reason with me as lovingly and patiently as they can.
('36', 424, 3, 28, 835517) I teach the children under my care not by being angry with them, but I teach them, if at all, by loving them, by
('36', 424, 4, 29, 835630) 1 The reference is to the assaults made on Gandhiji in 1908 by his Indian followers under the belief that he had compromised with the Smuts Government; vide”Letter to Friends”, 10 2 1908.
('36', 425, 0, 1, 835818) 426 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 425, 1, 2, 835860) allowing for their ignorance, and by playing with them.
('36', 425, 1, 3, 835916) I expect the same love, the same consideration and the same sportsmanlike spirit from my angry teachers.
('36', 425, 1, 4, 836021) I have given my opinion with regard to the dogs with the best of motives and as a matter of duty.
('36', 425, 1, 5, 836119) If I am mistaken, let the critics who would teach me reason with me patiently and logically.
('36', 425, 1, 6, 836212) Angry and irrelevant argument will not convince me.
('36', 425, 1, 7, 836264) A gentleman called on me the other evening at a late hour.
('36', 425, 1, 8, 836323) He knew that my time was completely occupied.
('36', 425, 1, 9, 836369) He engaged me in a discussion, used hard and bitter language and poured vials of wrath on me.
('36', 425, 1, 10, 836463) I answered his questions in good humour and politely.
('36', 425, 1, 11, 836517) He has published the interview in a leaflet which he is selling.
('36', 425, 1, 12, 836582) It is before me.
('36', 425, 1, 13, 836599) It has crossed the limits of truth, obviously of decorum.
('36', 425, 1, 14, 836657) He had neither obtained my permission to publish the interview nor showed it to me before publication.
('36', 425, 1, 15, 836760) Does he seek to teach me in this manner?
('36', 425, 1, 16, 836801) He who trifles with truth cuts at the root of ahimsa.
('36', 425, 1, 17, 836855) He who is angry is guilty of himsa.
('36', 425, 1, 18, 836891) How can such a man teach me ahimsa?
('36', 425, 1, 19, 836927) Even so the hostile critics are doing me a service.
('36', 425, 1, 20, 836979) They teach me to examine myself.
('36', 425, 1, 21, 837012) They afford me an opportunity to see if I am free from the reaction of anger.
('36', 425, 1, 22, 837090) And when I go to the root of their anger, I find nothing but love.
('36', 425, 1, 23, 837157) They have attributed to me ahimsa as they understand it.
('36', 425, 1, 24, 837214) Now they find me acting in a contrary manner and are angry with me.
('36', 425, 1, 25, 837282) They once regarded me as a mahatma, they were glad that my influence on the people was according to their liking.
('36', 425, 1, 26, 837396) Now I am an alpatma (a little soul) in their opinion; my influence on the people they now regard as unwholesome and they are pained by the discovery; and as they cannot control themselves, they turn the feeling of pain into one of anger.
('36', 425, 2, 27, 837634) I do not mind this outburst of anger, as I appreciate the motive behind it.
('36', 425, 2, 28, 837710) I must try to reason with them patiently, and if they would help me in my attempt, I request them to calm their anger.
('36', 425, 2, 29, 837829) I am a votary of truth and seeker after it.
('36', 425, 2, 30, 837873) If I am convinced that I am mistaken I shall admit my mistake (as I always love to do), and shall promptly mend it.
('36', 425, 2, 31, 837989) It is the word of the scriptures that the mistakes of a votary of truth never harm anybody.
('36', 425, 2, 32, 838081) That is the glorious secret of truth.
('36', 425, 2, 33, 838119) Just a word to friendly critics: I have preserved your letters.
('36', 425, 2, 34, 838183) I usually reply to my correspondents individually.
('36', 425, 2, 35, 838234) But the number of letters I have received this time and have been still getting is so large and they are so inordinately long that I cannot possibly reply to them
('36', 426, 0, 1, 838397) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 427
('36', 426, 1, 2, 838442) individually.
('36', 426, 1, 3, 838456) I cannot, I fear, make time even to acknowledge them.
('36', 426, 1, 4, 838510) Some of the correspondents ask me to publish their letters in Navajivan.
('36', 426, 1, 5, 838583) I hope they will not press the request.
('36', 426, 1, 6, 838623) I shall try to answer all the arguments that are relevant as well as I can, and hope that that will satisfy them.
('36', 426, 1, 7, 838737) I bespeak the indulgence of the reader for this necessary preface.
('36', 426, 1, 8, 838804) I shall now take up some of the letters before me.
('36', 426, 1, 9, 838855) A friend says:
('36', 426, 2, 10, 838870) You ask us not to feed stray dogs.
('36', 426, 2, 11, 838905) But we do not invite them.
('36', 426, 2, 12, 838932) They simply come.
('36', 426, 2, 13, 838950) How can they be turned back?
('36', 426, 2, 14, 838979) It will be time enough when there is a plethora of them.
('36', 426, 2, 15, 839036) But is there any doubt that feeding dogs cultivates the impulse of compassion and turning them away hardens our hearts?
('36', 426, 2, 16, 839156) We are all sinners.
('36', 426, 2, 17, 839176) Why should we not practise what little kindness we can?
('36', 426, 2, 18, 839232) It is from this false feeling of compassion that we encourage himsa in the name of ahimsa.
('36', 426, 2, 19, 839323) But as ignorance is no excuse before man made law, even so is it no excuse before the divine Law.
('36', 426, 2, 20, 839421) But let us analyse the argument.
('36', 426, 2, 21, 839454) We cast a morsel at the beggar come to our door, and feel that we have earned some merit, but we really thereby add to the numbers of beggars, aggravate the evil of beggary, encourage idleness and consequently promote irreligion.
('36', 426, 2, 22, 839684) This does not mean that we should starve the really deserving beggars.
('36', 426, 2, 23, 839755) It is the duty of society to support the blind and the infirm, but everyone may not take the task upon himself.
('36', 426, 2, 24, 839867) The head of the society, i.e., the mahajan or the State where it is well organized, should undertake the task, and the philanthropically inclined should subscribe funds to such an institution.
('36', 426, 2, 25, 840060) If the mahajan is pure minded and wise, it will carefully investigate the condition of beggars and protect the deserving ones.
('36', 426, 2, 26, 840187) When this does not happen, i.e., when relief is indiscriminate, scoundrels disguised as beggars get the benefit of it and the poverty of the land increases.
('36', 426, 2, 27, 840344) If it is thus a sin on the part of an individual to undertake feeding beggars, it is no less a sin for him to feed stray dogs.
('36', 426, 2, 28, 840471) It is a false sense of compassion.
('36', 426, 2, 29, 840506) It is an insult to the starving dog to throw a crumb at him.
('36', 426, 2, 30, 840567) Roving dogs do not indicate the civilization or compassion of the society, they betray on the contrary, the ignorance and lethargy of its members.
('36', 426, 2, 31, 840714) The lower animals are our brethren.
('36', 426, 2, 32, 840750) I include among them the lion and the tiger.
('36', 426, 2, 33, 840795) We do not know how to live with these carnivorous beasts and poisonous reptiles because of
('36', 427, 0, 1, 840886) 428 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 427, 1, 2, 840928) our ignorance.
('36', 427, 1, 3, 840943) When man knows himself better, he will learn to befriend even these.
('36', 427, 1, 4, 841012) Today he does not even know how to befriend a man of a different religion or from a foreign country.
('36', 427, 1, 5, 841113) The dog is a faithful companion.
('36', 427, 1, 6, 841146) There are numerous instances of the faithfulness of dogs and horses.
('36', 427, 1, 7, 841215) But that means that we should keep them and treat them with respect as we do our companions and not allow them to roam about.
('36', 427, 1, 8, 841341) By aggravating the evil of stray dogs we shall not be acquitting ourselves of our duty to them.
('36', 427, 1, 9, 841437) But if we regard the existence of stray dogs as a shame to us and, therefore, refuse to feed them, we shall be doing the dogs as a class a real service and make them happy.
('36', 427, 1, 10, 841610) What, then, can a humane man do for stray dogs?
('36', 427, 1, 11, 841658) He should set apart a portion of his income and send it on to a society for the protection of those animals if there be one.
('36', 427, 1, 12, 841783) If such a society is impossible—and I know it is very difficult even if it is not impossible—he should try to own one or more dogs.
('36', 427, 1, 13, 841915) If he cannot do so, he should give up worrying about the question of dogs and direct his humanity towards the service of other animals.
('36', 427, 1, 14, 842051) “But you are asking us to destroy them?” is the question angrily or lovingly asked by others.
('36', 427, 1, 15, 842145) Now, I have not suggested the extirpation of dogs as an absolute duty.
('36', 427, 1, 16, 842216) I have suggested the killing of some dogs as a”duty in distress” and under certain circumstances.
('36', 427, 1, 17, 842314) When the State does not care for stray dogs, nor does the mahajan, and when one is not prepared to take care of them oneself, then, and if one regards them as a danger to society, one should kill them and relieve them from a lingering death.
('36', 427, 1, 18, 842556) This is a bitter dose, I agree.
('36', 427, 1, 19, 842588) But it is my innermost conviction that true love and compassion consist in taking it.
('36', 427, 1, 20, 842674) The dogs in India are today in as bad a plight as the decrepit animals and men in the land.
('36', 427, 1, 21, 842766) It is my firm conviction that this sorry plight is due to our misconception of ahimsa, is due to our want of ahimsa.
('36', 427, 1, 22, 842883) Practice of ahimsa cannot have as its result impotence, impoverishment and famine.
('36', 427, 1, 23, 842966) If this is a sacred land we should not see impoverishment stalking it.
('36', 427, 1, 24, 843037) From this state of things some rash and impatient souls have drawn the conclusion that ahimsa is irreligion.
('36', 427, 1, 25, 843146) But I know that it is not ahimsa that is wrong, it is its votaries that are wrong.
('36', 427, 1, 26, 843229) Ahimsa is the religion of a Kshatriya.
('36', 427, 1, 27, 843268) Mahavira was a Kshatriya, Buddha was a Kshatriya, Rama and Krishna were Kshatriyas and all of them were votaries of ahimsa.
('36', 427, 1, 28, 843392) We want to propagate ahimsa in their
('36', 428, 0, 1, 843429) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 429
('36', 428, 1, 2, 843474) But today ahimsa has become the monopoly of timid Vaisyas 1
('36', 428, 2, 3, 843534) and that is why it has been besmirched.
('36', 428, 2, 4, 843574) Ahimsa is the extreme limit of forgiveness.
('36', 428, 2, 5, 843618) But forgiveness is the quality of the brave.
('36', 428, 2, 6, 843663) Ahimsa is impossible without fearlessness.
('36', 428, 2, 7, 843706) Cows we cannot protect, dogs we kick about and belabour with sticks, their ribs are seen sticking out, and yet we are not ashamed of ourselves and raise a hue and cry when a stray dog is killed.
('36', 428, 2, 8, 843901) Which of the two is better—that five thousand dogs should wander about in semi starvation living on dirt and excreta and drag on a miserable existence, or that fifty should die and keep the rest in a decent condition?
('36', 428, 2, 9, 844119) It is admittedly sinful always to be spurning and kicking the dogs.
('36', 428, 2, 10, 844187) But it is possible that the man who kills the dogs that he cannot bear to see tortured thus may be doing a meritorious act.
('36', 428, 2, 11, 844311) Merely taking life is not always himsa, one may even say that there is sometimes more himsa in not taking life.
('36', 428, 2, 12, 844423) We must examine this position in another article.

('36', 430, 8, 17, 847438) I am sending on the letters meant for Velanbehn and Moti.
('36', 430, 8, 18, 847496) Please do take the injection.
('36', 430, 8, 19, 847526) We can draw no conclusion from the fact the one person died after taking it.
('36', 430, 8, 20, 847603) Having put yourself under a doctor’s treatment, it is but right that you should put your trust in him.
('36', 430, 8, 21, 847706) If he is confident, we should have no fear at all.
('36', 430, 8, 22, 847757) Moti simply forgot to tell me about the matter.
('36', 430, 8, 23, 847805) She told me that you had refused to take the injection, but said nothing about your having asked for my advice.
('36', 430, 9, 24, 847917) I find it a difficult task to cure her of her carelessness and lethargy.
('36', 430, 9, 25, 847990) I cannot spare enough time for that.
('36', 430, 9, 26, 848027) Of course, I had a talk with her the very first day.
('36', 430, 9, 27, 848080) I may be able to do something only if I keep her with me.
('36', 430, 9, 28, 848138) But she also may not be ready for that.
('36', 430, 9, 29, 848178) I am sorry I cannot give her as much time as I should like to.
('36', 430, 9, 30, 848241) It is her old complaint from which Velanbehn has been suffering.

('36', 431, 7, 11, 848938) If you wish to see God, you should forget yourself, even if that means the end of your life the very next day.
('36', 431, 7, 12, 849049) If you dedicate every action to Rama, you will spontaneously have his name on your lips every moment.

('36', 431, 7, 14, 849201) To keep it, one should refrain from speaking or from communicating anything by writing, or do it only for immediate practical purposes.

('36', 432, 1, 5, 850065) Ponder over the meaning of this question, and treat dogs as you might treat plants.

('36', 432, 5, 10, 850339) [October 24, 1926]
('36', 432, 6, 11, 850358) In this meeting only the representatives have been called in view of my resolve not to go out during the year unless there is some specific reason.
('36', 432, 6, 12, 850506) I have not called all the workers to this meeting, so that the subjects which we cannot discuss in a large meeting can be discussed in this small meeting.
('36', 432, 6, 13, 850661) I have thirty five years of experience of directing the affairs of public societies.
('36', 432, 6, 14, 850746) And it is our general habit to spend as much as we get and not to accumulate, though you can spend as much as you like.
('36', 432, 6, 15, 850866) Even if you collect Rs. 1 crore, in my opinion, your institution will deteriorate like other institutions.
('36', 432, 6, 16, 850973) On the contrary whatever you spend for your workers you would get it back with compound interest.
('36', 432, 6, 17, 851071) You demand bonus from the mills, but the millowners say that they have not enough money to declare bonus.
('36', 432, 6, 18, 851177) Let me tell you that unless you give up drinking and other vices, your demands will not have the least effect on your superiors.
('36', 432, 6, 19, 851306) The remedy to remove your grievances is in your hands.
('36', 432, 6, 20, 851361) If you wish to bring swaraj in the mills, you will have to put an end to all your vices.
('36', 432, 6, 21, 851450) You should work with full enthusiasm in the mills as if you were the owners of the mill.
('36', 432, 6, 22, 851539) And you should so organize your Union that not a single worker remains out of it.
('36', 432, 6, 23, 851621) Your Union is well known in India; you must not, therefore, become unduly proud of it.
('36', 432, 6, 24, 851708) This Union is regarded as the best in India because it is so well organized.

('36', 433, 8, 17, 852772) She could perceive the shock I felt.
('36', 433, 8, 18, 852809) I hope you duly received both my cables 1. I am anxious to know that you got them because I wanted you to feel that I was a sharer of your sorrows.

('36', 433, 8, 21, 853132) My faith in the immortality of the soul is more stable than ever.
('36', 433, 8, 22, 853198) I know, therefore, that it is all well with him.”Death is but a sleep and a forgetting.” This is no poetic phrase with me and you.

('36', 434, 6, 12, 854132) Millie will be deeply cut up.
('36', 434, 6, 13, 854162) But she is a brave woman and will soon recover from the shock.

('36', 434, 9, 15, 854237) Will you please look up Mrs. P. K. Naidu when you go to Johannesburg and find out, too, how she is being supported?
('36', 434, 9, 16, 854353) Rama chandran has gone to the National Muslim University at Delhi to teach spinning and Shanti is about to leave for Singapore in search of a living as he wishes to support the girl whom he expects some day to marry.
('36', 434, 9, 17, 854570) Devdas is still at Mussoorie, Krishnadas still in Bengal and Pyarelal still with Mathuradas.
('36', 434, 9, 18, 854663) We are having a fair share of malaria.
('36', 434, 9, 19, 854702) But the patients are on the road to recovery.

('36', 435, 12, 13, 855403) I have your letter.
('36', 435, 12, 14, 855423) I am of the view that we should save our boys from the pre sent day schools.
('36', 435, 12, 15, 855500) If we get a good teacher, it is better to place the boys in his charge.
('36', 435, 12, 16, 855572) It would be best, of course, to have a good school.
('36', 435, 13, 17, 855624) Our actions in past lives are no doubt the chief cause of our being involved in the concerns of our present life.
('36', 435, 13, 18, 855738) When I used to travel third class, there were many occasions when I cleaned compartment dirtied by passengers.
('36', 435, 13, 19, 855849) Some felt ashamed and stopped dirtying it, and some just did not care to take any notice.
('36', 435, 13, 20, 855939) When I first went to Rajendrababu’s place, he was in Puri.
('36', 435, 13, 21, 855998) He did not even know that I had gone to his place, nor did I know him personally.
('36', 435, 13, 22, 856080) His servant treated me as he would a poor man.
('36', 435, 13, 23, 856127) I was dressed like one, and the servant was not at fault at all.
('36', 435, 13, 24, 856192) Rajendrababu met me a few days afterwards in Muzaffarpur.

('36', 437, 2, 3, 857564) TO JOURNALIST FRIENDS
('36', 437, 3, 4, 857586) Applications for articles for journals and magazines in and out of India are daily pouring in upon me.
('36', 437, 3, 5, 857689) Things have come to such a pass that I must either leave Young India and Navajivan editing or respectfully refuse to write for other papers.
('36', 437, 3, 6, 857830) Since I must not, so long as there are enough subscribers and I have energy, give up Young India or Navajivan, I have been forced to stop writing for other papers.
('36', 437, 3, 7, 857994) The fact is I have not the ability to write at will on any and every subject.
('36', 437, 3, 8, 858072) My field is very limited and even on the subjects I am familiar with, I cannot always be original.
('36', 437, 3, 9, 858171) I have no false notions about the efficacy of my writings.
('36', 437, 3, 10, 858230) On the contrary I know that often the unwritten word is more forcible and truer than the written or the spoken word.
('36', 437, 3, 11, 858347) Let the sum of our acts speak.
('36', 437, 3, 12, 858378) The continuous multipli cation of ephemeral literature is growing into a terrible nuisance which I must not assist to increase, even if I cannot do anything to stop or regulate it.
('36', 437, 4, 13, 858559) A WARNING
('36', 437, 5, 14, 858569) Of late many young men have been coming to the Satyagraha Ashram, without warning, and without permission, either to stay for a short time or to be admitted as candidates for membership.
('36', 437, 5, 15, 858756) Much as the management would like to find room for all who choose to come, whether as visitors or candidate members, it is physically impossible even to make the attempt.
('36', 437, 5, 16, 858927) The Ashram is at present taxed to its utmost capacity and the management has been obliged to put off even friends who had sought previous permission and intended to find their own expenses.
('36', 437, 5, 17, 859117) It is improper for young men to come without notice and permission.
('36', 437, 5, 18, 859185) During the past fortnight, four such young men have come.
('36', 437, 5, 19, 859243) And what was more grievous still was that they did not even bring enough to pay their way back.
('36', 437, 5, 20, 859339) The last was an M.A., who said he came with the view of joining the Ashram, but on the way, altered his decision and thought he would stay for a few days and study the Ashram life.
('36', 437, 5, 21, 859520) He had brought with him no credentials and had not enough money on his person to buy a return ticket.
('36', 437, 5, 22, 859622) I had to harden my heart and tell him that he could not stay at the Ashram without having obtained previous permission.
('36', 437, 5, 23, 859742) It is incomprehensible to me that well educated young men should not know the ordinary court esies of life and the laws of hospitality.
('36', 437, 5, 24, 859878) I know that there is an evil
('36', 438, 0, 1, 859907) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 439
('36', 438, 1, 2, 859952) reputation about the Ashram.
('36', 438, 1, 3, 859981) Visitors who have come without notice have sometimes told me that they thought that the Ashram was the one place in India where people could go without permission and find a warm welcome.
('36', 438, 1, 4, 860169) It is therefore as well for young men to realize that the Ashrams cannot live up to any such expectation and that it is but an ordinary human institution striving to reach its ideals and ever failing to do so.
('36', 438, 1, 5, 860379) The members would be satisfied if it could be said of them that they had tried their best to realize the ideals they had subscribed to.
('36', 438, 2, 6, 860515) ABOUT FASTING
('36', 438, 3, 7, 860529) ‘A Precisionist’ writes:
('36', 438, 4, 8, 860554) A devoted ant careful filer as I am of your paper, I have to draw your attention to the following dictum in its issue of 30 9 26:”Fasting can be resorted to only against one’s nearest and dearest, and that for his or her good.” 1
('36', 438, 5, 9, 860784) From your previous writings, however, it would appear that there is one important exception to this.
('36', 438, 5, 10, 860885) Fasting or hunger striking in prison against humiliating treatment, as in case food is offered in an insulting manner, is also true satyagraha.
('36', 438, 5, 11, 861029) I wish you had not lost sight of this while writing to an enquirer on the ethics of”Satyagraha—True and False”.
('36', 438, 5, 12, 861141) If the instance quoted by ‘A Precisionist’ is an exception, I could quote many others.
('36', 438, 5, 13, 861228) A man may fast for penance, purification and for considerations of physical health.
('36', 438, 5, 14, 861312) More such instances can perhaps be given.
('36', 438, 5, 15, 861354) But in the first case, I have pointed out the limits of satyagrahic fasting, i.e., when you seek to influence people by fasting.
('36', 438, 5, 16, 861483) The so called exception is a dissimilar case.
('36', 438, 5, 17, 861529) There the protest was against the felt humiliation.
('36', 438, 5, 18, 861581) In“Satyagraha—True and False”, emphasis was put on the evil of fasting against a person to make him pay what the fast ing person considered was his due and the opponent considered not to be due.
('36', 438, 6, 19, 861776) HINDU AND HINDUISM
('36', 438, 7, 20, 861795) A correspondent who is a patient and diligent reader of Young India writes:
('36', 438, 8, 21, 861871) Replying to the catechism of ‘An Assistant Executive Engineer’ in your issue of 14 10 26 you say:”In a concrete manner he is a Hindu who believes in God, immortality of the soul, etc.”
('36', 438, 9, 22, 862056) On reading this I am tempted to confront you with your own writing of
('36', 438, 10, 23, 862126) 1 Vide”Satyagraha—True and False”, 12 9 1926. An English translation of this by Mahadev Desai appeared in Young India, 30 9 1926.

('36', 439, 1, 2, 862298) nearly two years ago.
('36', 439, 1, 3, 862320) In Young India of April 24, 1924, p.
('36', 439, 1, 4, 862357) 136, 1 you wrote:”If I were asked to define the Hindu creed I should simply say: ‘Search after Truth through non violent means.
('36', 439, 1, 5, 862485) A man may not believe in God and still call himself a Hindu.
('36', 439, 1, 6, 862546) Hinduism is a relentless pursuit after Truth.’”
('36', 439, 2, 7, 862594) THE ITALICS IN BOTH QUOTATIONS ARE MINE.
('36', 439, 2, 8, 862635) I am surprised that the correspondent does not see the distinc tion between the two statements.
('36', 439, 2, 9, 862731) One refers to a Hindu in a concrete manner.
('36', 439, 2, 10, 862775) Denial of the existence of God is not a characteristic of Hinduism.
('36', 439, 2, 11, 862843) Millions of Hindus do believe in God.
('36', 439, 2, 12, 862881) Therefore one may say ‘there are Hindus who believe in God, etc.’ But ‘a man may not believe in God and still call himself a Hindu’.
('36', 439, 2, 13, 863014) In the second case I have attempted an exhaustive definition.
('36', 439, 2, 14, 863076) In the first case, I have given a fairly general illustration.
('36', 439, 2, 15, 863139) I, therefore, see no conflict between the two positions.
('36', 439, 3, 16, 863196) CUSTOMS EXACTIONS
('36', 439, 4, 17, 863214) A passenger who has recently returned from South Africa asked me if it was not possible to undo the evil of extortions that regularly take place in the Customs Department.
('36', 439, 4, 18, 863386) Although his luggage contained nothing taxable, he said he had to give a bribe in order to get the clearance in time.
('36', 439, 4, 19, 863504) I asked him if he would give enough time and trouble to the matter and face an inquiry.
('36', 439, 4, 20, 863592) He said he could not do so.
('36', 439, 4, 21, 863620) This attitude is normal and explains the existence of the exactions which are not only to be found in the customs but also on railways.
('36', 439, 4, 22, 863756) Whilst it is true that the public must be prepared to suffer temporary inconveniences, if they want redress, it is up to the authorities to pre vent so far as it is humanly possible exactions which poor people have to suffer.
('36', 439, 4, 23, 863982) It will not be a bad thing for some public spirited young men to submit themselves to these exactions and then report them to the proper quarters.
('36', 439, 4, 24, 864129) A few such cases will lessen the evil.
('36', 439, 4, 25, 864168) The only way to the eradication of the evil is no doubt an incorruptible public.
('36', 439, 4, 26, 864249) So long as there are people who would evade customs dues, so long will there be customs officials who will want their price.

('36', 440, 1, 2, 864481) 509. A BOON TO CULTIVATORS
('36', 440, 2, 3, 864508) Some months ago Sjt.
('36', 440, 2, 4, 864529) Ramachandran of Madras, an agricultural graduate, wrote to me to recommend his well lift for use in the Ashram.
('36', 440, 2, 5, 864641) He claimed for it great saving of labour to the animals used in the ordinary contrivances and also saving in cost.
('36', 440, 2, 6, 864756) The invention attracted me and I wrote to the inventor telling him that if he came himself and successfully installed the lift, the lift would be bought.
('36', 440, 2, 7, 864910) He promptly responded and his invention has been at work at the Ashram for over a month.
('36', 440, 2, 8, 864999) Everyone who knows anything of agriculture at the Ashram is thoroughly satisfied with the working of the lift.
('36', 440, 2, 9, 865110) To make assurance doubly sure, I had it examined by an engineer, who too considered the invention to be quite sound and extremely ingenious.
('36', 440, 2, 10, 865251) This is what the inventor has to say for his invention:
('36', 440, 3, 11, 865307) I am convinced that rapid extension of well irrigation for our dry lands which form 80 per cent of the arable lands in India is the real solution for the agricultural problem of India.
('36', 440, 3, 12, 865492) The income from dry land does not exceed Rs. 30 an acre, while the same land when irrigated from a well produced crops worth Rs. 200 to 1000 per acre, providing ample work for a number of families all the year round.
('36', 440, 3, 13, 865709) The chief difficulty in the way is that costly pairs of bullocks are necessary, they often suffer from yoke galls, badly deteriorate in health and that their efficiency is very low.
('36', 440, 3, 14, 865891) With a view to solve this difficulty, nearly 14 years ago I began my experiments and trials, and placed before the market this humble contrivance, now working on the Ashram well.
('36', 440, 3, 15, 866070) The new contrivance is only the ordinary kos known also as charas, mot or kavalai with reduced friction in the ramp or the inclined plane by the use of a trolley on a railed incline for generating power by the mere weight of an animal.
('36', 440, 3, 16, 866306) Just as a bicycle helps a man to go 12 miles an hour while he can walk only 3 miles an hour, this trolley helps the animal to do 4 times as much work as the same animal would do in the ordinary way.
('36', 440, 3, 17, 866505) This great reduction in friction has enabled only one animal instead of two to lift each time almost the same quantity of water as in the ordinary way, without any waste of energy in pulling.
('36', 440, 3, 18, 866697) This single animal being relieved from pulling lifts double the number of buckets per hour.
('36', 440, 3, 19, 866789) So the quantity of water lifted in the R. Lift should not be judged by the mere shape and size of the bucket nor by the effort and number of animals used, but by the actual capacity of the bucket multiplied by the number of buckets lifted per hour.
('36', 440, 3, 20, 867038) It has been tested and recorded all over India by experts that a good pair of bulls worth Rs. 300 to 400 lift only 1,600 gallons per hour from a depth of 20 feet.
('36', 440, 3, 21, 867201) I have been demonstrating in the Ashram as I have been doing elsewhere how a male buffalo (purchased by the Ashram for Rs. 31) has been lifting 2,000 gallons per hour (60 buckets of 32 gallons each per hour)
('36', 441, 0, 1, 867409) 442 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 441, 1, 2, 867451) from a depth of 34 feet, whereas two costly bullocks in our time honoured lift can draw a little over 1,000 gallons per hour (30 buckets of 35 gallons each per hour).
('36', 441, 1, 3, 867618) I have demonstrated and convinced more than 20 officers of the Madras Agricultural and Industrial Departments in vain at an enormous cost to me during the last 11 years.
('36', 441, 1, 4, 867788) Dr. Clouston during my demonstration of this lift at Nagpur admitted and highly appreciated the simplicity of the mechanism, high efficiency and the humane mode of applying animal power.
('36', 441, 2, 5, 867975) The cost of the whole appliance is Rs. 275 for a depth of 50 feet, but Sjt.
('36', 441, 2, 6, 868051) Ramachandran says that if the lift became popular, the price could be further reduced.
('36', 441, 2, 7, 868138) For the depth of 30 ft.
('36', 441, 2, 8, 868162) it costs only Rs. 230. With a suitable organization the lift could be made available to any cultivator in India for Rs. 150. I have also suggested that if the patent rights are given up or if the parts that can be locally had are so made or purchased, there might be still further reduction.
('36', 441, 2, 9, 868454) Add to the present cost of the R. Lift the cost of a male buffalo, say Rs. 30. The whole lift would cost no more than Rs. 305. The cost of a pair of bullocks would range from Rs. 300 to 400. The greatest saving is however effected in the monthly expenditure.
('36', 441, 2, 10, 868713) The upkeep of a pair of bullocks would be Rs. 50 to 60, whereas that of a male buffalo would be Rs. 20 to 25. The greatest use of the invention lies in the immense saving of labour to animals, and a still greater lies in the work that can be taken from the male buffalo who for want of use is in the vast majority of cases cruelly left to perish where he is not actually butchered.
('36', 441, 3, 11, 869095) The wonder, therefore, is that this invention has not attracted the attention of the Government.
('36', 441, 3, 12, 869192) Ramachandran has many bitter complaints to make about the indifference of the authorities whom he approached.

('36', 441, 3, 14, 869382) Let those who wish visit the Ashram and see the lift at work at the Ashram every morning.
('36', 441, 3, 15, 869472) As much water is not required at the present moment, the lift is not kept at work the whole day.
('36', 441, 3, 16, 869569) But it will be working between 8 and 10 a.m.
('36', 441, 3, 17, 869614) always, and will be in charge of the inventor himself who will gladly explain all about it.
('36', 441, 4, 18, 869706) A friend writing to me about the Agricultural Exhibition in Poona says:
('36', 441, 5, 19, 869778) I see here piles of machinery and tools most of which we can never use.
('36', 441, 6, 20, 869850) I miss the thing which is a boon to man and animal in India.

('36', 442, 3, 5, 870259) I join my respectful condolences to those already conveyed to the staff and family of the late editor of The Hindu—S. Rangaswami Iyengar.
('36', 442, 3, 6, 870397) This death, closely following Mr. S. Kasturiranga Iyengar’s, is a heavy blow to Indian journalism.
('36', 442, 3, 7, 870496) The reader will be grieved to learn that Mr. H. S. L. Polak has just lost his eldest son, Waldo.
('36', 442, 3, 8, 870593) Early in the week a cable was received from Mr. Polak telling me of Waldo’s serious illness.
('36', 442, 3, 9, 870686) It was followed only two days later by another, announcing the sudden death.
('36', 442, 3, 10, 870763) The parents’ grief, I know, will be shared by many who have known Mr. and Mrs. Polak as friends of India.

('36', 443, 3, 11, 872712) All, therefore, I know about Romain Rolland is what I have learned from those who have come into personal contact with him.
('36', 443, 3, 12, 872836) Perhaps it is better that I know him through the living touch of mutual friends.
('36', 443, 3, 13, 872917) They have enabled me to understand and appreciate the deep humanity of all his acts in every sphere of life.
('36', 443, 3, 14, 873026) The world is the richer for his life and work.
('36', 443, 3, 15, 873073) May he be long spared to continue the noble mission of spreading peace among mankind.

('36', 444, 4, 5, 873619) DEAR FRIEND,
('36', 444, 5, 6, 873632) Mira has given me a good translation of your beautiful letter.
('36', 444, 5, 7, 873695) 1 I think I understand and appreciate its spirit fully.
('36', 444, 5, 8, 873751) I would have gladly gone to Helsingfors had I not felt that the invitation was prompted and not spontaneous.
('36', 444, 5, 9, 873860) There were other reasons.
('36', 444, 5, 10, 873886) I waited for the call from within, it did not come.
('36', 444, 5, 11, 873938) I give you my assurance that I shall not resist it when it comes.
('36', 444, 5, 12, 874004) I fear my estimate of your book was not quite correctly repro duced.
('36', 444, 5, 13, 874073) I knew that you wrote from the deepest conviction.
('36', 444, 5, 14, 874124) One thing more I would like to have off my mind.
('36', 444, 5, 15, 874173) In the album presented to you, I am one of the contributors.
('36', 444, 5, 16, 874234) The Poet has sent me the message that my description of you as my self chosen advertiser has given you offence.
('36', 444, 5, 17, 874346) I can only give you my assurance that the ex pression was used as a mark of my affection for you and my unworthiness to deserve your attention.
('36', 444, 5, 18, 874490) It may be difficult for the man in the street to believe, but cannot be for you, when I say that I simply do not understand the fuss that is made about my qualities.
('36', 444, 5, 19, 874656) And I have no false modesty about me.
('36', 444, 5, 20, 874694) I do expect to meet you in the flesh some day and that in the best of health.

('36', 445, 3, 4, 875205) DEAR FRIEND, It was a great relief to me when Vaze replied that you fully intended to go to S.A. 1 Andrews sent a cable telling me that there was a rumour of your illness and consequent cancellation of your mem bership and that the rumour had greatly upset our people.
('36', 445, 3, 5, 875474) Your letter now sets all doubt at rest.
('36', 445, 3, 6, 875514) I sent a reassuring cable to Andrews imme diately on Vaze’s wire.
('36', 445, 3, 7, 875580) I quite agree with you that not much is to be expected from the conference.
('36', 445, 3, 8, 875656) But I am not without hope that our people will have some breathing time.
('36', 445, 3, 9, 875729) The opinion I have expressed upon the killing of stray dogs has indeed estranged many from me.
('36', 445, 3, 10, 875824) But that has ever been my lot.
('36', 445, 3, 11, 875855) I know that the latest storm will pass like its predecessors.
('36', 445, 3, 12, 875917) I do hope you are keeping excellent health and that you will be able to retain it during the trying times ahead of you in S. A. Andrews and I set much store by your being in the deputation.
('36', 445, 3, 13, 876107) Somehow or other your inclusion has given me a feeling of safety.

('36', 446, 3, 4, 876735) DEAR FRIEND, 1. When I pray, I do not ask for anything but I simply think of some of the verses or hymns which I fancy for the moment.
('36', 446, 3, 5, 876870) 2. The relation between God and myself is not only at prayer but, at all times, that of master and slave in perpetual bondage.
('36', 446, 3, 6, 876997) 3. Prayer is to me the intense longing of the heart to merge myself in the Master.
('36', 446, 3, 7, 877080) If a man does not pray, evidently he has no longing; there is no feeling of helplessness and when there is no helplessness, there is no need for help.
('36', 446, 3, 8, 877231) 4. The class eat the corn produced by the mass from purely selfish motives.
('36', 446, 3, 9, 877307) But when the class begin to use khaddar, they will do so deliberately for the sake of serving the mass and establishing the bond between themselves and the mass.

('36', 446, 3, 11, 877559) As the leaders do, so will the followers.

('36', 448, 1, 2, 879618) 519. IS THIS HUMANITY? IV
('36', 448, 2, 3, 879644) [October 31, 1926] Taking life may be a duty.
('36', 448, 2, 4, 879690) Let us consider this position.
('36', 448, 2, 5, 879721) We do destroy as much life as we think is necessary for sustain ing the body.
('36', 448, 2, 6, 879799) Thus for food we take life, vegetable and other, and for health we destroy mosquitoes and the like by the use of disinfectants, etc., and we do not think that we are guilty of irreligion in doing so.
('36', 448, 2, 7, 879999) This is as regards one’s own self.
('36', 448, 2, 8, 880034) But for the sake of others, i.e., for the benefit of the species, we kill carnivorous beasts.
('36', 448, 2, 9, 880128) When lions and tigers pester their villages, the villagers regard it a duty to kill them or have them killed.
('36', 448, 2, 10, 880238) Even man slaughter may be necessary in certain cases.
('36', 448, 2, 11, 880292) Suppose a man runs amuck and goes furiously about sword in hand, and kill ing anyone that comes his way, and no one dares to capture him alive.
('36', 448, 2, 12, 880436) Anyone who dispatches this lunatic will earn the gratitude of the community and be regarded a benevolent man.
('36', 448, 2, 13, 880546) From the point of view of ahimsa it is the plain duty of everyone to kill such a man.
('36', 448, 2, 14, 880632) There is, indeed, one exception if it can be so called.
('36', 448, 2, 15, 880688) The yogi who can subdue the fury of this dangerous man may not kill him.
('36', 448, 2, 16, 880761) But we are not here dealing with beings who have almost reached perfection; we are considering the duty of the society, of the ordinary erring human beings.
('36', 448, 2, 17, 880918) There may be a difference of opinion as regards the apposite ness of my illustrations.
('36', 448, 2, 18, 881005) But if they are inadequate, others can be easily imagined.
('36', 448, 2, 19, 881064) What they are meant to show is that refraining from taking life can in no circumstances be an absolute duty.
('36', 448, 2, 20, 881173) The fact is that ahimsa does not simply mean non killing.
('36', 448, 2, 21, 881231) Himsa means causing pain to or killing any life out of anger or from a selfish purpose, or with the intention of injuring it.
('36', 448, 2, 22, 881357) Refraining from so doing is ahimsa.
('36', 448, 2, 23, 881393) The physician who prescribes bitter medicine causes you pain but does no himsa.
('36', 448, 2, 24, 881473) If he fails to prescribe bitter medicine when it is necessary to do so, he fails in his duty of ahimsa.
('36', 448, 2, 25, 881577) The surgeon who, from fear of causing pain to his patient, hesitates to amputate a rotten limb is guilty of himsa.
('36', 448, 2, 26, 881692) He who refrains from killing a murderer who is about to kill his ward (when he cannot prevent him otherwise)earns no merit, but commits a sin, he practises no ahimsa but himsa out of a fatuous sense of ahimsa.
('36', 448, 2, 27, 881902) Let us now examine the root of ahimsa.
('36', 448, 2, 28, 881941) It is uttermost selfless 
('36', 449, 0, 1, 881967) 450 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 449, 1, 2, 882009) Selflessness means complete freedom from a regard for one’s body.
('36', 449, 1, 3, 882075) When some sage observed man killing numberless creatures, big and small, out of a regard for his own body, he was shocked at his ignorance.
('36', 449, 1, 4, 882215) He pitied him for thus forgetting the deathless soul, encased within the perishable body, and for thinking of the ephemeral physical pleasure in preference to the eternal bliss of the spirit.
('36', 449, 1, 5, 882407) He therefrom deduced the duty of complete self efface ment.
('36', 449, 1, 6, 882467) He saw that if man desired to realize himself, i.e., truth, he could do so only by being completely detached from the body, i e., by making all other beings feel safe from him.
('36', 449, 1, 7, 882644) That is the way of ahimsa.
('36', 449, 1, 8, 882671) A realization of this truth shows that the sin of himsa consists not in merely taking life, but in taking life for the sake of one’s perishable body.
('36', 449, 1, 9, 882821) All destruction therefore involved in the process of eating, drinking, etc., is selfish and, therefore, himsa.
('36', 449, 1, 10, 882932) But man regards it to be unavoidable and puts up with it.
('36', 449, 1, 11, 882990) But the destruction of bodies of tortured creatures being for their own peace cannot be regarded as himsa, or the unavoidable destruction caused for the purpose of protecting one’s wards cannot be regarded as himsa.
('36', 449, 1, 12, 883206) This line of reasoning is liable to be most mischievously used used but that is not because the reasoning is faulty, but because of the inherent frailty of man to catch at whatever pretexts he can get to deceive himself to satisfy his selfishness or egoism.
('36', 449, 1, 13, 883464) But that danger may not excuse one from defining the true nature of ahimsa.
('36', 449, 1, 14, 883540) Thus, we arrive at the following result from the foregoing: 1. It is impossible to sustain one’s body without the destruction of other bodies to some extent.
('36', 449, 1, 15, 883698) 2. All have to destroy some life (a) for sustaining their own bodies; (b) for protecting those under their care; or (c) sometimes for the sake of those whose life is taken.
('36', 449, 1, 16, 883871) 3. (a) and (b) in (2) mean himsa to a greater or less extent.
('36', 449, 1, 17, 883933) (c) means no himsa, and is therefore ahimsa.
('36', 449, 1, 18, 883978) Himsa in (a) and (b) is unavoidable.
('36', 449, 1, 19, 884015) 4. A progressive ahimsaist will, therefore, commit the himsa con tained in (a) and (b) as little as possible, only when it is unavoi dable, and after full and mature deliberation and having exhausted all reme dies to avoid it.
('36', 449, 1, 20, 884242) The destruction of dogs that I have suggested came under (4) and can, therefore, be resorted to only when it is unavoidable, when there is no other remedy and after mature deliberation.
('36', 449, 1, 21, 884428) But I have not the slightest doubt that refraining from that destruction when it is
('36', 450, 0, 1, 884512) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 451
('36', 450, 1, 2, 884557) unavoidable is worse than destruction.
('36', 450, 1, 3, 884596) And, therefore, although there can be no absolute duty to kill dogs, etc., it becomes a necessary duty for certain people at certain times and under certain circumstances.
('36', 450, 1, 4, 884768) I shall now try to take up one by one some of the questions that have been asked me.
('36', 450, 1, 5, 884853) Some correspondents demand personal replies, and in case I fail to do so threaten to publish their views.
('36', 450, 1, 6, 884959) It is impossi ble for me to reach every individual correspondent by a perso nal reply.
('36', 450, 1, 7, 885046) Those that are necessary I shall deal with here.
('36', 450, 1, 8, 885095) I have no right, nor desire, to stop people from carrying on the controversy in other papers.
('36', 450, 1, 9, 885189) I may remind the correspondents, however, that threats and impatience have no place in a sober and religious discussion.
('36', 450, 1, 10, 885310) A correspondent asks:
('36', 450, 2, 11, 885332) How did you hit upon the religion of destroying dogs at the old age of 57?
('36', 450, 2, 12, 885407) If it had occurred to you earlier than this, why were you silent so long?
('36', 450, 2, 13, 885481) Man proclaims a truth only when he sees it and when it is necessary, no matter even if it be in his old age.
('36', 450, 2, 14, 885590) I have long recognized the duty of killing such animals within the limits laid down above, and have acted up to it on occasions.
('36', 450, 2, 15, 885719) In India the villagers have long recognized the duty of destroying intruding dogs.
('36', 450, 2, 16, 885802) They keep dogs who scare away intruders and kill them if they do not escape with their lives These watch dogs are purposely maintained with a view to protecting the village from other dogs, etc., as also from thieves and robbers whom they attack fearlessly.
('36', 450, 2, 17, 886060) The dogs have become a nui sance only in cities, and the best remedy is to have a law against stray dogs.
('36', 450, 2, 18, 886166) That will involve the least destruction of dogs and ensure the protection of citizens.
('36', 450, 2, 19, 886253) Another correspondent asks:
('36', 450, 3, 20, 886281) Do you expect to convince people by logical argument in a matter like that of ahimsa?
('36', 450, 3, 21, 886367) The rebuke contained in this is not without some substance.
('36', 450, 3, 22, 886427) But I wanted to convince no one.
('36', 450, 3, 23, 886460) Being a student and practiser of ahimsa, I have had to give expression to my views when the occasion demanded it.
('36', 450, 3, 24, 886574) I have an opinion based on experience that logic and reasoning have some place, no doubt very small, in a religious discussion.

('36', 451, 6, 20, 887543) I understand how your boys are shaping.
('36', 451, 6, 21, 887583) When boys grow old, they must be allowed to go their way.

('36', 451, 6, 24, 887823) You are well out of them.
('36', 451, 6, 25, 887849) I am not religiously against quinine.

('36', 451, 6, 27, 887930) I should be chary of using it for myself.
('36', 451, 6, 28, 887972) Heaven only knows whether I am going to Gauhati or not.
('36', 451, 6, 29, 888028) But I suppose I will have to go.
('36', 451, 6, 30, 888061) I have no heart in going there.
('36', 451, 6, 31, 888093) My work lies in the Ashram and I see my use here.
('36', 451, 6, 32, 888143) However, a month hence is too long a time for one to speculate about.
('36', 451, 6, 33, 888213) Are you keeping all right?

('36', 452, 6, 14, 889175) I have read nothing about this Parishad.

('36', 452, 6, 16, 889294) For the sake of Truth even, not a single step should be taken in excitement or haste.
('36', 452, 6, 17, 889380) If out of fear we refrain from doing something, that will be contrary to truth.

('36', 454, 9, 12, 891541) The Editor, Young India
('36', 454, 11, 13, 891565) I must confess that I was rather mistaken in being too sure about the knowledge of Hindustani possessed by the Colonial born Indians.
('36', 454, 12, 14, 891699) As regards the Fiji Indians being sent to British Guiana, I remain convinced that the experiment will lead to another disappointment to the Fiji people.
('36', 454, 13, 15, 891852) I remind you that in 1920 you made the mistake of recommending an experimental shipment of 500 labourers to British Guiana and confessed it when it was pointed out to you by Mr. Polak and others.
('36', 454, 13, 16, 892048) 2 I am afraid that you are repeating your mistake.
('36', 454, 13, 17, 892099) I am sure that the Fiji returned emigrants, accustomed as they are to one of the finest tropical climates, will find their life miserable in that malaria ridden mudland of British Guiana.
('36', 454, 13, 18, 892287) I am entirely opposed to the idea of Fiji Indians being sent to British Guiana.
('36', 454, 13, 19, 892367) My main argument against the experiment recommended by you rests on higher grounds of humaneness.
('36', 454, 13, 20, 892465) I beseech you to reconsider the whole

('36', 455, 2, 3, 892827) Yours, etc., BANARASIDAS CHATURVEDI The foregoing letter was received some time ago.
('36', 455, 2, 4, 892912) But I was anxious to verify for myself the”confession” imputed to me.
('36', 455, 2, 5, 892982) Pandit Banarasidas Chaturvedi has kindly sent me a cutting containing an interview which I gave some years ago regarding an experimental ship ment.
('36', 455, 2, 6, 893130) I have seen the”confession”.
('36', 455, 2, 7, 893159) In my opinion, it has no rele vance to the present opinion.
('36', 455, 2, 8, 893219) My opinion is concerned only with those who are now living in a disgraceful state in Calcutta, who cannot and will not go to the villages, and for whom any other state will be probably better than the present.
('36', 455, 2, 9, 893429) They may, in my opinion, go to British Guiana, if they choose.
('36', 455, 2, 10, 893492) They cannot lose much.
('36', 455, 2, 11, 893515) Their going is not even to be used as a preliminary to the shipment of others.
('36', 455, 2, 12, 893594) The remedy I have suggested is an emergency measure dealing with only a few hundreds at the outset.
('36', 455, 2, 13, 893694) It should be remembered that my recommendation is for sending Fiji Indians to British Guiana only if any other remedy fails, and even then it is subject to the final consent of the people themselves.
('36', 455, 2, 14, 893894) I am therefore sorry that I cannot reconsider the opinion I have given.
('36', 455, 2, 15, 893966) A permanent remedy no doubt lies in consi dering and dealing adequately with the whole question of emi gration.

('36', 455, 4, 18, 894112) SUBSCRIBERS TO A.I.S.A.
('36', 455, 5, 19, 894136) The subscriptions for the new year of the All India Spinners Association are coming in but not as fast as they might be.
('36', 455, 5, 20, 894257) It is hoped that the subscribers this year will make it a point to improve the qua lity of their yarn in strength, evenness and fineness.
('36', 455, 5, 21, 894395) They should aim at a standard count so as to make it possible to weave their yarn into one good piece.
('36', 455, 5, 22, 894498) Indeed this sacrificial yarn should be far superior to the yarn spun for hire.
('36', 455, 5, 23, 894577) But a correspondent says:
('36', 455, 6, 24, 894603) You write about improving the quality of yarn, you refer to testing machines.
('36', 455, 6, 25, 894681) Then is it not necessary to advise the spinning member of the defects in his spinning, so that he may try to improve it?
('36', 455, 6, 26, 894802) Attempts are being made to have all yarn tested at the A.I.S.A. office but only a limited number of packets can be tested per day.
('36', 455, 7, 27, 894933) 1 Only extracts are reproduced here.
('36', 456, 0, 1, 894970) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 457
('36', 456, 1, 2, 895015) Whenever the yarn is tested, the result is sent to the spinner.
('36', 456, 1, 3, 895079) But I suggest to those who are anxious to make quick progress to improvise their own testing contrivance, which they can do without any difficulty or expense.
('36', 456, 1, 4, 895238) The improvised contrivance has already been described in these pages.
('36', 456, 1, 5, 895308) 1 It is well for the members to remember that the A.I.S.A. represents the poor man’s movement and, therefore, cannot afford to spend much at the central office.
('36', 456, 1, 6, 895469) Decentralization and distribution have to keep pace with centralization and concentration.
('36', 456, 2, 7, 895560) FROM ENGLAND A lady from Bristol sends the following:
('36', 456, 3, 8, 895614) Herewith £1 towards the spinning wheels, would it were £100. I expect you do not realize how much help you get from spirits in England who realize the awful weight that lies upon you and try to help you, sending forth their spirits to you.
('36', 456, 3, 9, 895854) The virtue of letters like this lies not in the value of the monetary contribution but an appreciation of the fundamental fact underlying the spinning wheel, viz., that it is an attempt to replace the spirit of killing competition that threatens to turn man into beast by the spirit of co ordinated effort that lifts the whole humanity with the lifting of one’s own self.
('36', 456, 3, 10, 896226) This movement can only succeed if the purest forces in the world combine to work towards the consumm ation.
('36', 456, 3, 11, 896334) But the momentum must first come from within India’s borders.
('36', 456, 3, 12, 896396) And if I had no faith in God, in India and the cause,”the awful weight” would certainly kill me.
('36', 456, 3, 13, 896493) As it is, I turn the weight over to God’s broad shoulders.

('36', 456, 4, 15, 896575) 528. PRECARIOUS CONDITION IN SOUTH AFRICA
('36', 456, 5, 16, 896617) The latest mail from South Africa has brought me a batch of papers which show the precarious condition of the Indian settlers in that sub continent.
('36', 456, 5, 17, 896766) Trade licenses are an eternal problem.
('36', 456, 5, 18, 896805) The adm inistrative reins are being daily tightened.
('36', 456, 5, 19, 896858) Hitherto, in Natal, it has been a fairly recognized rule not to touch old licenses under the wide discretionary powers given to licensing officers except for cases of grave insanitation or breach of conditions imposed by the officers.
('36', 456, 5, 20, 897093) But that sound rule is gradually being disregarded and even renewals are being arbitrarily refused.
('36', 456, 5, 21, 897193) The case sent to me is pathetic and refers to an old lady Mrs. Sophia Bhayla.

('36', 457, 1, 2, 897395) gress in introducing the case says:
('36', 457, 2, 3, 897431) This poor lady with five children has been ruined through the caprice of the licensing officer and to avoid being put in jail by her creditors, it is highly likely that she will have to seek the protection of the law of insolvency.
('36', 457, 2, 4, 897663) The judges of the appellate courts showed their sympathy for the poor woman but declared themselves powerless, being bound under the statute not to interfere with the discretion vested by the legislature in the licensing officers, except when they can be proved to have been bribed or incapable of exercising the powers vested in them.
('36', 457, 2, 5, 897999) Here is what the principal judgment says:
('36', 457, 3, 6, 898041) The licensing officer refused her license after she had held it for many years and it would appear that the refusal is based on the ground that this lady had not paid the dues which it is said she should have paid to the Town Council of Estcourt.
('36', 457, 3, 7, 898288) At first sight it would appear that that was somewhat harsh for the licensing officer, who happens to be town clerk and town treasurer and holds other offices as well, because of the knowledge that he had as town treasurer and town clerk, he should say as licensing officer: “Well, you had trouble with my employers, the Town Council, and you have not paid your rates or the dues which are payable and, therefore, I will not grant you a renewal of this license.” That does appear to one’s mind to be inequitable.
('36', 457, 3, 8, 898801) If this lady had committed an offence against the bye laws, there was a ready remedy for that by prosecuting her or by proceeding against her according to the law if she had broken any contract.
('36', 457, 3, 9, 898996) Thus, the judges though willing were unable to redress a mani fest wrong.
('36', 457, 3, 10, 899070) When a law is bad, a judge is helpless unless he resigns.
('36', 457, 3, 11, 899128) Such heroic action is not to be expected in these days.
('36', 457, 3, 12, 899184) But the Government is not powerless.
('36', 457, 3, 13, 899221) Town Councils, composed as they are of rival traders, are not to be expected to do justice.
('36', 457, 3, 14, 899313) They will generally use the powers given to them for crushing their rivals, but the central administration can certainly render aid in such glaring cases.
('36', 457, 3, 15, 899468) The Round Table Conference will be a mockery, if even cases of manifest hardship remain unredressed.
('36', 457, 3, 16, 899569) The Class Areas Bill may be shelved for ever but if the spirit animating it survives, the position of the settlers will in no wise be better than if the Bill had been passed.
('36', 457, 3, 17, 899744) An empty victory will be worse than a proper defeat.
('36', 457, 3, 18, 899797) For in the noise of it, the cry of the anguish of the sufferers may be hushed and they may be denied even the solace of sympathy.

('36', 458, 1, 2, 899995) 529. A PLEA FOR PURITY
('36', 458, 2, 3, 900018) It is no longer possible for me to suppress the voluminous correspondence that is pouring in upon me in connection with the elections and, incidentally, with canvassing for Congress membership.
('36', 458, 2, 4, 900212) A candidate for legislature membership writes: 1
('36', 458, 3, 5, 900261) When I embarked upon this business I had no notion of what I was to be in for.
('36', 458, 3, 6, 900340) My agents play false.
('36', 458, 3, 7, 900362) They attribute to me virtues which I do not recognize in myself.
('36', 458, 3, 8, 900427) My opponents condemn me to vice I have never been guilty of.
('36', 458, 3, 9, 900488) I want a clean and a fair fight.
('36', 458, 3, 10, 900521) Can you show a way out or will you simply say that Council going is wrong and I must retire?
('36', 458, 3, 11, 900614) Another correspondent writes: 2
('36', 458, 4, 12, 900646) Can you not as of yore prevent the frauds that are being perpetrated in the name of the Congress, and, shall I say, even in your name?
('36', 458, 4, 13, 900781) How can you remain silent now when these frauds can be proved to exist?
('36', 458, 4, 14, 900853) I can give you proofs if you want them.
('36', 458, 5, 15, 900893) Here in my Province, parties who are interested in packing the Congress—I can use no other word—are degrading the Congress name and with it the name of khaddar till both stink in one’s nostrils.
('36', 458, 5, 16, 901088) Men are practically picked up in the streets, their subscriptions are paid for them and pieces of khaddar are wrapped round them in order to fulfil the letter of the law of the Congress.
('36', 458, 5, 17, 901275) Surely you can raise your voice against this debasing practice.
('36', 458, 5, 18, 901339) Will these men or their representatives enable us to get swaraj?
('36', 458, 5, 19, 901404) Retirement or no retirement, we expect you at least to use your pen against these practices.
('36', 458, 6, 20, 901497) A third correspondent writes: 3
('36', 458, 7, 21, 901529) Do you know that, in my province, shameful practices are being
('36', 458, 8, 22, 901592) resorted to in order to register members?
('36', 458, 8, 23, 901634) A man of loose character has got hold
('36', 458, 9, 24, 901672) of women of ill fame—I personally know at least one—and is using them or
('36', 458, 10, 25, 901745) her for the work of canvassing members.
('36', 458, 10, 26, 901785) She goes from door to door, appeals
('36', 458, 11, 27, 901821) to the baser passions of mankind and gets members.
('36', 458, 11, 28, 901872) Is this legal?
('36', 458, 11, 29, 901887) Is this
('36', 458, 12, 30, 901895) What is the Congress worth when members are registered by these
('36', 458, 13, 31, 901959) means?.
('36', 458, 13, 32, 901967) Are you prepared to justify the canvassing of Congress members
('36', 458, 14, 33, 902030) by such women?
('36', 458, 14, 34, 902045) And, if not, will you not say so publicly?

('36', 459, 0, 1, 902141) 460 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 459, 1, 2, 902183) A fourth correspondent sends me cuttings which show that candidates and their supporters appeal to sub communal passions.
('36', 459, 1, 3, 902305) He says: 1
('36', 459, 2, 4, 902316) Hindu and Muslim divisions we have, but now we have an appeal to
('36', 459, 3, 5, 902381) provincial and caste jealousies and passions, that is to say, voters are asked to
('36', 459, 4, 6, 902463) vote for men belonging to their own province or to their own castes and
('36', 459, 5, 7, 902535) trades, and not for their intrinsic worth.
('36', 459, 6, 8, 902578) A fifth correspondent sends me cuttings containing speeches which I cannot reproduce, which almost beat Billings gate.
('36', 459, 7, 9, 902697) A sixth tells me that money is being freely used which can only be described as bribery.
('36', 459, 7, 10, 902786) Men who were never worth much are today getting handsome salaries merely because they can speak and because they are supposed to wield some influence in their own districts.
('36', 459, 7, 11, 902960) They have no opinions of their own.
('36', 459, 7, 12, 902996) Some of them are brazen faced enough to own that they are only acting as agents and that they would champion any policy, as a lawyer champions for money any cause that he gets, irrespective of morals.
('36', 459, 8, 13, 903197) I have been told that all these things are inevitable when a nation is rising from stupor.
('36', 459, 8, 14, 903288) No doubt there is some truth in this.
('36', 459, 8, 15, 903326) When people were thoroughly apathetic and only a few men were interested in running elections and running associations, impurities remained underground.
('36', 459, 8, 16, 903479) Now that a large body of people are taking part in these public matters, the impurities which were hidden are coming to the surface.
('36', 459, 8, 17, 903612) Unfortunately if all my correspondents are right, there is not anything better left under the surface, in other words, impurities are not superficial, but they are in the whole body itself.
('36', 459, 8, 18, 903802) I should hope that things are not so bad and that the body is sound and that the statements made above are true only in isolated cases.
('36', 459, 9, 19, 903938) I do not know.
('36', 459, 9, 20, 903953) I confess that I am not following the newspapers.
('36', 459, 9, 21, 904003) Nor am I otherwise in touch with what is going on and it was for that reason that I have hitherto refrained from noticing the volumin ous correspondence before me.
('36', 459, 9, 22, 904167) But some of the correspondents are known to me.
('36', 459, 9, 23, 904215) All of them have given me their names and addresses and some of them have offered to supply me with further particulars.

('36', 460, 1, 2, 904389) Some of them have sent me newspaper cuttings in corroboration.
('36', 460, 1, 3, 904452) I felt in the circumstances that I should be wrong if I did not even give a gist of this correspondence.
('36', 460, 1, 4, 904557) I have digested it for what it is worth and present it for the serious consideration of workers all over India who are taking part in the elections, no matter to what party they belong.
('36', 460, 1, 5, 904743) I draw the particular attention of all Congress workers to the painful allegations made.
('36', 460, 1, 6, 904832) The latter must remember that the Congress creed is still unamended.
('36', 460, 1, 7, 904901) The creed requires them to work for the attainment of swaraj by peaceful and legitimate means.
('36', 460, 1, 8, 904996) Theresolutions require the absolute use of pure khaddar on all Congress occasions.
('36', 460, 1, 9, 905079) Let the Congress workers then not believe their creed or their resolutions.
('36', 460, 1, 10, 905155) And if I have no creed for non Congressmen to draw attention to, I wish they would realize that without purity of public life, swaraj is an impossibility.

('36', 460, 2, 12, 905333) 530. LITERALISM
('36', 460, 3, 13, 905349) A correspondent writes thus passionately:
('36', 460, 4, 14, 905391) I am afraid there is a little fly in the ointment of your splendid defence (in Young India of September 23) of the practice of Divine prayer, especially
('36', 460, 5, 15, 905544) congregational prayer.
('36', 460, 5, 16, 905567) At the end of the article, referring to churches, temples and mosques you say, “These places of worship are not a mere idle superstition to be swept away at the first opportunity.
('36', 460, 5, 17, 905747) They have survived all attacks up to now and are likely to persist to the end of time.
('36', 460, 6, 18, 905834) On reading this I asked myself: Attacks by whom?
('36', 460, 6, 19, 905883) Surely those attacks were not made by atheists or scoffers or humbugs, to anything like the extent to which the opposing sects of God believers are known to have attacks the places of worship of one another.
('36', 460, 6, 20, 906091) In fact, most, if not all, of the attacks you speak of were perpetrated by ‘godly’ zealots, in the name and for the glory of each one’s own God.
('36', 460, 6, 21, 906236) It would be insulting your knowledge of world history to
('36', 460, 7, 22, 906293) cite instances.
('36', 460, 8, 23, 906309) Secondly, I asked myself: Is it true—is it strictly correct to say, that these places of worship have survived all attacks?
('36', 460, 8, 24, 906433) Again the answer is: Surely not.
('36', 460, 8, 25, 906466) Witness the site at Kashi (or Benares) where had stood the temple of Vishvanath for long centuries, since even before Lord Buddha’s time—but where now stands dominating the ‘Holy City’ a mosque built out of the ruins of
('36', 460, 9, 26, 906686) 1 Vide “No Faith in Prayer”.
('36', 460, 9, 27, 906715) 23 9 1926.
('36', 461, 0, 1, 906726) 462 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 461, 1, 2, 906768) the desecrated old temple by orders of no less a man than the ‘Living Saint’ (Zinda Pir), the ‘Ascetic King’ (Sultan Auliya), the ‘Puritan Emperor’—
('36', 461, 2, 3, 906917) Aurangzeb.
('36', 461, 2, 4, 906928) Again, it is not the ‘unbelieving’ British, but the terrible believer, Ibn Saud, and his Wahabi hosts, that are responsible for the recent demolition and desecration of many places of worship in the Hedjaz (Muslims’ ‘Holy Land’), over which Mussalman Indians are just now so loudly lamenting, and which the Nizam of Hyderabad—alone of all Muslim rulers in the world—has vainly tried to restore with his money.
('36', 461, 3, 5, 907338) Do these facts mean nothing to you Mahatmaji?
('36', 461, 3, 6, 907384) These facts do mean a great deal to me.
('36', 461, 3, 7, 907424) They show undoubtedly man’s barbarity.
('36', 461, 3, 8, 907463) But they chasten me.
('36', 461, 3, 9, 907484) They warn me against beco ming intolerant.
('36', 461, 3, 10, 907527) And they make me tolerant even towards the intole rant.
('36', 461, 3, 11, 907583) They show man’s utter insignificance and thus drive him to pray, if he will not be led to it.
('36', 461, 3, 12, 907677) For, does not history record instances of humbled pride bending the knee before the Almighty, washing His feet with tears of blood and asking to be reduced to dust under His heels?
('36', 461, 3, 13, 907858) Verily ‘the letter killeth, the spirit giveth life.’
('36', 461, 4, 14, 907911) The writer who is one of the most regular and painstaking rea ders of Young India should know by this time that places of worship to me are not merely brick and mortar.
('36', 461, 4, 15, 908080) They are but a shadow of the reality.
('36', 461, 4, 16, 908118) Against every church and every mosque and every temple destroyed, hundreds have risen in their places.
('36', 461, 4, 17, 908221) It is wholly irrelevant to the argument about the necessity of prayer that the so called believers have belied their belief and that many places renowned for their sacred character have been razed to the ground.
('36', 461, 4, 18, 908433) I hold it to be enough, and it is enough for my argument, if I can prove that there have been men in the world, and there are men today in existence, for whom prayer is positively the bread of life.
('36', 461, 4, 19, 908632) I recommend to the correspondent the practice of going unobserved to mosques, temples and churches, without any preconceived ideas, and he will discover as I have discovered that there is something in them which appeals to the heart and which transforms those who go there, not for show, not out of shame or fear, but out of simple devotion.
('36', 461, 4, 20, 908974) It defies analysis.
('36', 461, 4, 21, 908994) Nevertheless the fact stands that pure minded people going to the present places of pilgrimage which have become hot beds of error, superstition, and even immorality, return from them purer for the act of worship.
('36', 461, 4, 22, 909208) Hence the significant assurance in the Bhagavad Gita: “ I make return according to the spirit in which men worship Me.” 1
('36', 461, 5, 23, 909330) What the correspondent has written undoubtedly shows our
('36', 462, 0, 1, 909387) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 463
('36', 462, 1, 2, 909432) present limitations, which we must try as early as possible to get rid of.
('36', 462, 1, 3, 909507) It is a plea for purification of religions, broadening of the outlook.
('36', 462, 1, 4, 909578) That much needed reform is surely coming.
('36', 462, 1, 5, 909620) There is a better world consciousness, and may I say that even the reform we all hanker after needs intense prayer in order to achieve deeper purification of self ?
('36', 462, 1, 6, 909785) For, without deeper purification of mankind in general, mutual tole ration and mutual goodwill are not possible.

('36', 462, 4, 9, 909957) A friend from Neemach Cantt.
('36', 462, 5, 10, 909986) 1. Do the untouchables, also called atishudras by people of higher castes,
('36', 462, 6, 11, 910061) —do they too have the right to offer worship before the image of Vishnu and
('36', 462, 7, 12, 910137) to take it out in a procession through the streets?
('36', 462, 8, 13, 910189) 2. Do the Vaishnavas go to hell if they have darshan of an image of Vishnu
('36', 462, 9, 14, 910264) which has been worshiped by atishudras?
('36', 462, 9, 15, 910304) That people still feel the need to ask such questions is a matter of sorrow.
('36', 462, 9, 16, 910381) I firmly believe that our Antyaja brothers have as much right to place the image of Vishnu in a chariot and take it out in a procession as any other people.
('36', 462, 9, 17, 910538) And so, too, a Vaishnava far from committing a sin earns merit by darshan of an image which has been worshiped by atishudras.
('36', 462, 9, 18, 910664) A Vaishnava who knowingly avoids wor shipping such an image brings the Vaishnava dharma into contempt.

('36', 463, 14, 21, 912059) Your letter.
('36', 463, 14, 22, 912072) I received Baijnathji’s hundi and have sent him the receipt.

('36', 464, 2, 6, 912584) 535. PREFACE TO” SHRIMAD RAJCHANDRA” November 5, 1926
('36', 464, 3, 7, 912638) INTRODUCTION When Shri Revashanker Jagjivan, whom I regard as an elder brother, asked me for a foreword to this 3 edition of Shrimad Rajchandra’s 4 letters and writings, I could not refuse his request.
('36', 464, 3, 8, 912840) As I tried to think what I could say in such a foreword, I felt that it would serve two purposes if I gave the few chapters of my reminiscences of Rajchandra which I wrote in the Yeravda jail 5: one, that as my attempt, though incomplete, was undertaken purely in a spirit of religious devotion, it might help other mumukshus 6 like me, and two, that those who did not know Shrimad Rajchandra in life might know a little about him and so find it easier to understand some of his writings.
('36', 464, 3, 9, 913329) The chapters which follow leave the story incomplete.
('36', 464, 3, 10, 913383) I do not think that I can complete it, for, even if I get time, I do not feel inclined to go much further than the point where I left off.
('36', 464, 3, 11, 913522) I, therefore, wish to complete the last chapter, which had remained unfinished, and include in it a few things.
('36', 464, 3, 12, 913634) In these chapters I have not touched upon one aspect of the subject which I think I should place before the readers.
('36', 464, 3, 13, 913751) Some people assert that Shrimad was the twenty fifth Tirthankar 7. Some others believe that he has attained moksha.
('36', 464, 3, 14, 913867) Both these beliefs, I think, are improper.
('36', 464, 3, 15, 913910) Either those who hold them do not know Shrimad or their definitions of Tirthankar or liberated soul are different from the com monly accepted ones.
('36', 464, 3, 16, 914058) We may not lower the standard of truth even
('36', 464, 4, 17, 914102) 1 On November 2 2 Members of the Royal Agricultural Commission with whom Gandhiji discussed the benefits of the spinning wheel and khadi 3 Second edition.
('36', 464, 4, 18, 914257) It cannot be ascertained when the first edition was published.
('36', 464, 4, 19, 914320) 4 Rajchandra Ravjibhai Mehta 5 Gandhiji was in this jail from March 1922 to February 1924. 6 Seekers after moksha, deliverance from phenomenal existence as the supre me end of life 7 A soul that has risen to perfection and teaches the way to others.
('36', 464, 4, 20, 914570) Jains believe in 24 such Tirthankars, of whom Mahavira, a contemporary of the Buddha, was the last.
('36', 465, 0, 1, 914670) 466 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 465, 1, 2, 914712) for the sake of those whom we love dearly.
('36', 465, 1, 3, 914755) Moksha is a condition of supreme value.
('36', 465, 1, 4, 914795) It is the highest state of the atman 1. It is so rare a condition that to attain it much more effort and patience are necessary than, say, for emptying the sea drop by drop with a blade of grass.
('36', 465, 1, 5, 914991) A perfect description of that state is impossible.
('36', 465, 1, 6, 915042) A Tirthankar will naturally command, without seeking them, the powers which belong to the state immediately preceding moksha.
('36', 465, 1, 7, 915168) One who has attained freedom while still living in this body will suffer from no physical disease.
('36', 465, 1, 8, 915267) In a body untroubled by desire there can be no disease.
('36', 465, 1, 9, 915323) There can be no disease where there is no attachment.
('36', 465, 1, 10, 915377) Where there is desire there is attachment and while there is attachment moksha is impossible.
('36', 465, 1, 11, 915471) Shrimad had not attained the total freedom from attachment which should characterize a mukta purusha 2 or the vibhuti which belongs to a Tirthankar.
('36', 465, 1, 12, 915620) He had such freedom and such powers in a much larger measure than the ordinary man or woman, and so in common speech we may describe him as one who was free from attachment or who possessed superhuman powers.
('36', 465, 1, 13, 915829) I am sure, however, that Shrimad had not attained to the perfect freedom from attachment which we attribute to a mukta purusha or acquired the vibhuti which we believe that a Tirthankar would manifest.
('36', 465, 1, 14, 916031) I do not say this with the intention of pointing out any shortcoming in a great character worthy of our highest reverence; I say it in order to do justice both to him and to the cause of truth.
('36', 465, 1, 15, 916225) We are all worldly creatures, whereas Shrimad was not.
('36', 465, 1, 16, 916280) We shall have to wander from existence to existence, whereas Shrimad may have only one life more to live.
('36', 465, 1, 17, 916386) We are perhaps running away from moksha, while Shrimad was flying towards it with the speed of wind.
('36', 465, 2, 18, 916487) This was no small achievement.
('36', 465, 2, 19, 916518) Even so, I must say that he had not attained the supreme state so beautifully described by him.
('36', 465, 2, 20, 916614) He himself said that he had come upon the Sahara in his journey and that he had failed to cross the desert.
('36', 465, 2, 21, 916722) Shrimad Rajchandra, however, was a rare being.
('36', 465, 2, 22, 916769) His writings are the quintessence of his experiences.
('36', 465, 2, 23, 916823) Anyone who reads them, reflects over them and follows them in his life will find the path to moksha easier; his yearning for sense pleasures will become progressively weaker, he will become disinterested in the affairs of this world, will cease to be attached to the life of the body and devote himself to the welfare of the atman.

('36', 466, 0, 1, 917187) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 467
('36', 466, 1, 2, 917232) The reader will see from this that Shrimad’s writings are meant only for those who are qualified to study them.
('36', 466, 1, 3, 917344) All readers will not find them interesting.
('36', 466, 1, 4, 917388) Those who are inclined to be critical will get material for criticism.
('36', 466, 1, 5, 917459) But those who have faith will find these writings of absorbing interest.
('36', 466, 1, 6, 917532) I have always felt that Shrimad’s writings breathe the spirit of truth.
('36', 466, 1, 7, 917604) He did not write a single word in order to show off his knowledge.
('36', 466, 1, 8, 917671) His aim in his writings was to share his inward bliss with his readers.
('36', 466, 1, 9, 917743) I am sure that anyone who wishes to free himself from inner conflicts and is eager to know his duty in life will gain much from Shrimad’s writings, whether such a reader is a Hindu or belongs to another faith.
('36', 466, 2, 10, 917953) And, hoping that the few reminiscences of Shrimad’s life which I have written down will help the reader who is qualified to read his writings, I give them here as part of this Foreword.
('36', 466, 3, 11, 918139) SOME REMINISCENCES OF RAYCHANDBHAI
('36', 466, 4, 12, 918174) CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTORY
('36', 466, 5, 13, 918198) Today is the birth anniversary of the late Shrimad Rajchandra, whose reminiscences I have started writing, that is, it is the Kartiki Purnima 1, Samvat 1979. I am not attempting to write a biography of Shrimad; such an attempt is beyond my capacity.
('36', 466, 5, 14, 918448) I do not have with me the material needed for a biography.
('36', 466, 5, 15, 918507) If I wanted to write one, I would spend some time in his birth place, the port of Vavania 2, examine the house in which he lived, see the places which were the scenes of his childhood play and wanderings, meet his childhood friends, visit the school which he attended, interview his friends, disciples and relatives and gather from them all information which was likely to be useful; only after I had done all this would I start writing the biography.
('36', 466, 5, 16, 918959) But I have not visited these places or become acquainted with such persons.
('36', 466, 5, 17, 919035) And now I have begun to doubt even my capacity for writing these reminiscences.
('36', 466, 5, 18, 919115) I remember to have remarked more than once that, if I had the time, I would write such reminiscences.
('36', 466, 5, 19, 919217) One of his disciples, for whom I feel the highest respect, heard me say this, and I have undertaken this attempt mainly to satisfy him.
('36', 466, 5, 20, 919353) I would be happy,

('36', 467, 0, 1, 919461) 468 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 467, 1, 2, 919503) in any case, to write these reminiscences of Shrimad Rajchandra, whom I used to call Raychandbhai or the Poet, out of my love and respect, and explain their significance to mumukshus.
('36', 467, 1, 3, 919687) As it is, however, my attempt is merely intended to satisfy a friend.
('36', 467, 1, 4, 919757) To be able to do justice to these reminiscences of his life, I should be well acquainted with the Jain way, which I must admit I am not.
('36', 467, 1, 5, 919894) I will, therefore, write them from an extremely restricted point of view.
('36', 467, 1, 6, 919968) I will content myself with a record of my memories of him and of the events in his life which had left an impression on me, and with a discussion of what I learned from those occasions.
('36', 467, 1, 7, 920154) The benefit which I thus derived, or some benefit similar to that, will perhaps be derived by the reader who is a mumukshu from a perusal of these reminiscences.
('36', 467, 1, 8, 920316) I have used the word mumukshu advisedly.
('36', 467, 1, 9, 920357) This attempt at writing my reminiscences is not intended for all classes of readers.
('36', 467, 1, 10, 920442) Three persons have influenced me deeply, Tolstoy, Ruskin and Raychandbhai: Tolstoy through one of his books and through a little correspondence with him, Ruskin through one book of his, Unto This Last—which in Gujarati I have called Sarvodaya,—and Raychandbhai through intimate personal contact.
('36', 467, 1, 11, 920738) When I began to feel doubts about Hinduism as a religion, it was Raychandbhai who helped me to resolve them.
('36', 467, 1, 12, 920847) In the year 1893, I came into close contact with some Christian gentlemen in South Africa.
('36', 467, 1, 13, 920938) Their lives were pure, and they were devoted to their religion.
('36', 467, 1, 14, 921002) Their main work in life was to persuade followers of other faiths to embrace Christianity.
('36', 467, 1, 15, 921093) Though I had come into contact with them in connection with practical affairs, they began to feel solicitude for my spiritual welfare.
('36', 467, 1, 16, 921228) I realized that I had one duty: that until I had studied the teachings of Hinduism and found that they did not satisfy my soul, I should not renounce the faith in which I was born.
('36', 467, 1, 17, 921409) I, therefore, started reading Hindu and other scriptures.
('36', 467, 1, 18, 921467) I read books on Christianity and Islam.
('36', 467, 1, 19, 921507) I carried on correspondence with some friends I had made in London.
('36', 467, 1, 20, 921575) I placed my doubts before them.
('36', 467, 1, 21, 921607) I entered into correspondence with every person in India in whom I had some trust, Raychandbhai being the chief among them.
('36', 467, 1, 22, 921731) 1 I had already been introduced to him and a close bond had grown between us.
('36', 467, 1, 23, 921809) I had respect for him, and so I decided to get from him everything he could give.
('36', 467, 1, 24, 921891) The result was that I gained peace of mind.
('36', 467, 1, 25, 921935) I felt reassured that Hinduism could give me what I
('36', 467, 2, 26, 921987) 1Vide”Gandhiji’s Questions to Rajchandra and his Replies”, before 12 12 1926.
('36', 468, 0, 1, 922065) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 469
('36', 468, 1, 2, 922110) needed.
('36', 468, 1, 3, 922118) The reader will have some idea of how much my respect for Raychandbhai must have increased because of his being responsible for this result.
('36', 468, 2, 4, 922259) Nevertheless, I have not accepted him as my guru.
('36', 468, 2, 5, 922309) I am still in search of one, and so far my feeling in regard to everyone whom I might think of as a guru has been”No, not this”.
('36', 468, 2, 6, 922438) One must have the requisite qualification to come upon a perfect guru, and I cannot claim to have it.
('36', 468, 3, 7, 922540) CHAPTER 2
('36', 468, 4, 8, 922550) I was introduced to Raychandbhai in July 1891, on the very day on which, returning from England, I landed in Bombay.
('36', 468, 4, 9, 922667) At this time of the year the sea is stormy.
('36', 468, 4, 10, 922711) The ship, therefore, had arrived late and it was already night.
('36', 468, 4, 11, 922775) I stayed with Dr. Pranjivan Mehta, Barrister, now the well known jeweller of Rangoon.
('36', 468, 4, 12, 922861) Raychandbhai was his elder brother’s son in law.
('36', 468, 4, 13, 922910) The doctor himslef introduced me to him.
('36', 468, 4, 14, 922951) On the same day I was also introduced to Jhaveri Revashanker Jagjivandas, another elder brother of his.
('36', 468, 4, 15, 923055) The doctor introduced Raychandbhai as”a poet”, and added,”though a poet, he is in our business.
('36', 468, 4, 16, 923151) He is a man of spiritual knowledge and a shatavadhani” 1. Someone suggested that I should utter a number of words in his presence, saying that no matter to what language they belonged he would repeat them in the same order in which I had uttered them.
('36', 468, 4, 17, 923403) I could not believe this.
('36', 468, 4, 18, 923429) I was a young man, had just returned from England, and was a little vain, too, of my knowledge of languages; in those days I was under the powerful spell of English.
('36', 468, 4, 19, 923595) Having been to England made a man feel that he was heaven born.
('36', 468, 4, 20, 923659) I poured out all my store of knowledge, and first wrote out words from different languages—for how possibly could I afterwards remember them in their due order?
('36', 468, 4, 21, 923820) I then read out the words.
('36', 468, 4, 22, 923847) Raychandbhai repeated them slowly one after another and in the same order.
('36', 468, 4, 23, 923922) I was pleased and astonished, and formed a high opinion about his memory.
('36', 468, 4, 24, 923996) This was an excellent experience to break a little the binding spell of English on me.
('36', 468, 5, 25, 924083) The Poet did not know English at all.
('36', 468, 5, 26, 924121) At the time I am speaking of, he was not more than twenty five.
('36', 468, 5, 27, 924185) His study in the Gujarati school was not much either.
('36', 468, 5, 28, 924239) And even then he possessed such a powerful
('36', 468, 6, 29, 924282) 1 One who can pay attention to a hundred things simultaneously
('36', 469, 0, 1, 924345) 470 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 469, 1, 2, 924387) memory and such knowledge, and was respected by everyone round him!
('36', 469, 1, 3, 924455) I was all admiration.
('36', 469, 1, 4, 924477) The power of memory is not sold in schools.
('36', 469, 1, 5, 924521) Knowledge, too, can be acquired without going to school if one wants it—is keen on it—and one need not go to England or elsewhere to command respect, for virtue is always respected.
('36', 469, 1, 6, 924703) I learned these truths on the very day I landed in Bombay.
('36', 469, 1, 7, 924762) The acquaintance with the poet which began on this occasion grew over the years.
('36', 469, 1, 8, 924843) Other persons possess a powerful memory, and one need not be dazzled by it.
('36', 469, 1, 9, 924919) Knowledge of the Shastras, too, is found in plenty in many.
('36', 469, 1, 10, 924979) But such persons, if they have no real culture, can give us nothing of value.
('36', 469, 1, 11, 925057) A combination of powerful memory and knowledge of the Shastras will have real worth and will benefit the world only if they exist along with genuine culture of the heart.
('36', 469, 2, 12, 925228) CHAPTER 3: VAIRAGYA 1
('36', 469, 3, 13, 925250) When shall I know that state supreme,
('36', 469, 4, 14, 925288) When will the knots, outer and inner, snap?
('36', 469, 5, 15, 925332) When shall I, breaking the bonds that bind us fast,
('36', 469, 6, 16, 925384) Tread the path trodden by the wise and the great?
('36', 469, 7, 17, 925434) Withdrawing the mind from all interests,
('36', 469, 8, 18, 925475) Using this body solely for self control,
('36', 469, 9, 19, 925516) He desires nothing to serve any ulterior end of his own,
('36', 469, 10, 20, 925573) Seeing nothing in the body to bring on a trace of the darkness
('36', 469, 11, 21, 925636) of ignorance.
('36', 469, 11, 22, 925650) These are the first two verses of Raychandbhai’s inspired utterance at the age of eighteen.
('36', 469, 11, 23, 925742) During the two years I remained in close contact with him, I felt in him every moment the spirit of vairagya which shines through these verses.
('36', 469, 11, 24, 925886) One rare feature of his writings is that he always set down what he had felt in his own experience.
('36', 469, 11, 25, 925986) There is in them no trace of unreality.
('36', 469, 11, 26, 926026) I have never read any line by him which was written to produce an effect on others.
('36', 469, 11, 27, 926110) He had always by his side a book on some religious subject and a note book with blank pages.
('36', 469, 11, 28, 926203) The latter he used for noting down any thoughts which occurred to him.
('36', 469, 11, 29, 926274) Somtimes, it would be prose and sometimes poetry.
('36', 469, 11, 30, 926324) The poem about
('36', 469, 12, 31, 926339) 1 State of disinterstedness towards wordly things
('36', 470, 0, 1, 926389) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 471
('36', 470, 1, 2, 926434) the”supreme state” must have been written in that manner.
('36', 470, 1, 3, 926492) Whatever he was doing at the moment, whether eating or resting or lying in bed, he was invariably disinterested towards things of the world.
('36', 470, 1, 4, 926633) I never saw him being tempted by objects of pleasure or luxury in this world.
('36', 470, 1, 5, 926711) I watched his daily life respectfully, and at close quarters.
('36', 470, 1, 6, 926773) He accepted whatever he was served at meals.
('36', 470, 1, 7, 926818) His dress was simple, a dhoti and shirt, an angarakhun 1 and a turban of mixed silk and cotton yarn.
('36', 470, 1, 8, 926919) I do not remember that these garments used to be strikingly clean or carefully ironed.
('36', 470, 1, 9, 927006) It was the same to him whether he squatted on the ground or had a chair to sit on.
('36', 470, 1, 10, 927089) In the shop, he generally squatted on a gadi 2.
('36', 470, 2, 11, 927137) He used to walk slowly, and the passer by could see that he was absorbed in thought even while walking.
('36', 470, 2, 12, 927241) There was a strange power in his eyes; they were extremely bright, and free from any sign of impatience or anxiety.
('36', 470, 2, 13, 927357) They bespoke single minded attention.
('36', 470, 2, 14, 927395) The face was round, the lips thin, the nose neither pointed nor flat and the body of light build and medium size.
('36', 470, 2, 15, 927509) The skin was dark.
('36', 470, 2, 16, 927528) He looked an embodiment of peace.
('36', 470, 2, 17, 927562) There was such sweetness in his voice that one simply wanted to go on listening to him.
('36', 470, 2, 18, 927650) The face was smiling and cheerful; it shone with the light of inner joy.
('36', 470, 2, 19, 927723) He had such ready command of language that I do not remember his ever pausing for a word to express his thoughts.
('36', 470, 2, 20, 927837) I rarely saw him changing a word while writing a letter.
('36', 470, 2, 21, 927894) And yet the reader would never feel that any thought was imperfectly expressed, or the construction of a sentence was defective or the choice of a word faulty.
('36', 470, 3, 22, 928054) These qualities can exist only in a man of self control.
('36', 470, 3, 23, 928111) A man cannot become free from attachments by making a show of being so.
('36', 470, 3, 24, 928183) That state is a state of grace for the atman.
('36', 470, 3, 25, 928229) Anyone who strives for it will discover that it may be won only after a ceaseless effort through many lives.
('36', 470, 3, 26, 928338) One will discover, if one struggles to get rid of attachments, how difficult it is to succeed in the attempt.
('36', 470, 3, 27, 928448) The Poet made me feel that this state of freedom from attachment was spontaneous to him.
('36', 470, 4, 28, 928537) The first step towards moksha is freedom from attachment.
('36', 470, 4, 29, 928595) Can we ever listen with pleasure to anyone talking about moksha so long as

('36', 471, 0, 1, 928749) 472 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 471, 1, 2, 928791) our mind is attached to a single object in this world?
('36', 471, 1, 3, 928846) If at any time we seem to do so, it is only the ear which is pleased, in the same way, that is, as we may be pleased merely by the musical tune of a song without following its meaning.
('36', 471, 1, 4, 929031) It will be a long time before such indulgence of the ear results in our adopting a way of life which could lead towards moksha.
('36', 471, 1, 5, 929159) Without genuine vairagya in the mind, one cannot be possessed with a yearning for moksha.
('36', 471, 1, 6, 929249) The poet was possessed by such yearning.
('36', 471, 2, 7, 929290) CHAPTER 4: BUSINESS LIFE
('36', 471, 3, 8, 929315) He is a true Vanik 1 who never speaks an untruth,
('36', 471, 4, 9, 929365) He is a true Vanik who never gives short measure,
('36', 471, 5, 10, 929415) He is a true Vanik who honours his father’s word,
('36', 471, 6, 11, 929465) He is a true Vanik who returns the principal with interest.
('36', 471, 7, 12, 929525) Good sense is the Vanik’s measure, and the king’s measure his credit.
('36', 471, 8, 13, 929595) Should the Vania 2 neglect business, suffering like a forest fire spreads far and
('36', 471, 10, 14, 929677) SHAMAL BHATT
('36', 471, 11, 15, 929690) It is generally believed that the spheres of practical affairs or business and spiritual pursuits or dharma are distinct from and incompatible with each other, that it is madness to introduce dharma into business, for we should succeed in neither if we made any such attempt.
('36', 471, 11, 16, 929966) If this belief is not false, there is no hope for us at all.
('36', 471, 11, 17, 930027) There is not a single concern or sphere of practical affairs from where dharma can be kept out.
('36', 471, 12, 18, 930123) Raychandbhai showed through his life that, if a man is devoted to dharma, this devotion should be evident in every action of his.
('36', 471, 12, 19, 930253) It is not true at all that dharma is something to be observed on the Ekadashi 3 day or during the Paryushan 4, on the Id 5 day or on a Sunday, in temples, churches or mosques, but not in the shop or the King’s court; on the contrary, Raychandbhai used to say and hold, and demonstrated through his own conduct, that such a belief amounted to ignorance of the nature of dharma.

('36', 472, 1, 2, 930897) The business in which he was engaged was that of diamonds and pearls.
('36', 472, 1, 3, 930967) He carried it on in partnership with Revashanker Jagjivan Jhaveri.
('36', 472, 1, 4, 931034) He also ran a cloth shop side by side.
('36', 472, 1, 5, 931073) I formed the impression that he was completely upright in his dealings.
('36', 472, 1, 6, 931145) I was accidentally present sometimes when he negotiated a deal.
('36', 472, 1, 7, 931209) His terms were always clear and firm.
('36', 472, 1, 8, 931247) I never saw any ‘cleverness’ about them.
('36', 472, 1, 9, 931288) If the other party tried it, he immediately saw through it, and would not tolerate it.
('36', 472, 1, 10, 931375) On such occasions, he would even knit his brows in anger, and one could see a flash of redness in his eyes.
('36', 472, 1, 11, 931483) Raychandbhai disproved the prevalent idea that a man who is wise in the sphere of dharma will not be wise in the affairs of practical life.
('36', 472, 1, 12, 931623) He displayed the utmost vigilance and intelligence in his business.
('36', 472, 1, 13, 931691) He could judge the worth of diamonds and pearls with the utmost accuracy.
('36', 472, 1, 14, 931765) Though he did not know English, he was quick in following the general substance of the letters and telegrams received from his agents in Paris and took no time to see through their tricks.
('36', 472, 1, 15, 931954) His guesses generally turned out to be correct.
('36', 472, 1, 16, 932002) Though he displayed such vigilance and intelligence in his business, he was never impatient or felt worried about his affairs.
('36', 472, 1, 17, 932129) Even when he was attending the shop, some book on a religious subject would always be lying by his side and, as soon as he had finished dealing with a customer, he would open it, or would open the note book in which he used to note down the thoughts which occurred to him.
('36', 472, 1, 18, 932402) Every day he had men like me, in search of knowledge, coming to him.
('36', 472, 1, 19, 932471) He would not hesitate to discuss religious matters with them.
('36', 472, 1, 20, 932533) The Poet did not follow the general, and beautiful, rule of doing business and discussing dharma each at its proper time, of attending to one thing at a time.
('36', 472, 1, 21, 932692) Being a shatavadhani, he could afford to violate it.
('36', 472, 1, 22, 932745) Others who might seek to emulate him would fare as a man trying to ride two horses at the same time.
('36', 472, 1, 23, 932846) Even for a man who is wholly devoted to dharma and is completely free from attachments, it would be best always to concentrate on what he is engaged in at the moment; in fact that would be the right thing for him to do.
('36', 472, 1, 24, 933066) That would be a sign of his being a man of yoga.
('36', 472, 1, 25, 933115) Dharma requires one to act in that manner.
('36', 472, 1, 26, 933158) If any work, be it business or something else, is a worthy activity, it ought to be done with single minded attention.
('36', 472, 1, 27, 933277) For a mumukshu, inward meditation on the self should be as spontaneous and continuous as breathing.
('36', 472, 1, 28, 933377) He should not cease from it even for a moment.
('36', 472, 1, 29, 933424) But even while meditating on the self, he should be totally absorbed in the work he was doing.
('36', 473, 0, 1, 933519) 474 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 473, 1, 2, 933561) I do not mean to say that the Poet did not live in this way.
('36', 473, 1, 3, 933622) I have said above that he used to display the utmost vigilance in his business.
('36', 473, 1, 4, 933702) I did, however, form the impression that the Poet exacted more work from his body than he should have done.
('36', 473, 1, 5, 933810) Could it possibly mean imperfection in his yoga?
('36', 473, 1, 6, 933859) It is a principle of dharma that one should even lay down one’s life in discharging one’s duty.
('36', 473, 1, 7, 933955) But to undertake work beyond one’s capacity and look upon it as one’s duty is a form of attachment.
('36', 473, 1, 8, 934055) I have always felt that the Poet did have this highly subtle attachment in him.
('36', 473, 2, 9, 934135) It often happens that man accepts work beyond his capacity through spiritual motives and then finds it difficult to cope with it.
('36', 473, 2, 10, 934265) We look upon this as virtue and admire it.
('36', 473, 2, 11, 934308) But looked at from a spiritual point of view, that is, from the point of view of dharma, there is every possibility that the motive behind such work springs from a subtle form of ignorance.
('36', 473, 3, 12, 934498) If we are no more than instruments in this world, if it is true that we are given this body on hire and that our highest duty is to attain moksha through it as quickly as we may, then we must certainly give up everything which may serve as an obstacle in our path—that is the only true spiritual attitude.
('36', 473, 4, 13, 934804) Raychandbhai himself had explained to me, in a different form and in his own wonderful manner, the argument I have advanced above.
('36', 473, 4, 14, 934935) How, then, did he come to take upon himself certain tasks which worried him and brought on severe illness on him?
('36', 473, 5, 15, 935049) If I am right in believing that even Raychandbhai was temporarily overcome with spiritual ignorance in the form of a desire to do good, the truth of the line”All creatures follow their nature, what then will constraint avail?” 1 is very well illustrated in his case, and this is all that it means.
('36', 473, 5, 16, 935347) There are some who use these words of Krishna to justify self indulgence; they altogether pervert their meaning.
('36', 473, 5, 17, 935460) Raychandbhai’s prakriti took him into deep waters despite himself.
('36', 473, 5, 18, 935527) To undertake work in this manner may be an error, but it may be considered so only in the case of one who is nearing perfection.
('36', 473, 5, 19, 935656) We, ordinary men and women, can do justice to a good cause only if we become mad after it.
('36', 473, 5, 20, 935747) We shall close this argument here.
('36', 473, 6, 21, 935782) 1 Bhagavad Gita, III, 33
('36', 474, 0, 1, 935807) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 475
('36', 474, 1, 2, 935852) It is also sometimes believed that religious minded men are so simple that everyone can deceive them, that they understand nothing about worldly affairs.
('36', 474, 1, 3, 936006) If this belief is true, then the two avatars, Krishnachandra and Ramachandra, should be looked upon not as incarnations but as mere ordinary men of the world.
('36', 474, 1, 4, 936165) The Poet used to say that it should be impossible to deceive a person of perfect spiritual knowledge.
('36', 474, 1, 5, 936267) A person may be religious minded, that is, may be moral in his life, but may have no spiritual knowledge.
('36', 474, 1, 6, 936373) What is required for moksha, however, is a happy combination of moral life and spiritual knowledge which is the result of one’s own experience.
('36', 474, 1, 7, 936517) In the presence of one who has acquired such knowledge, hypocrisy and fraud cannot keep their mask for long.
('36', 474, 1, 8, 936626) Untruth cannot flourish in the presence of truth.
('36', 474, 1, 9, 936676) In the presence of non violence, violence ceases.
('36', 474, 1, 10, 936726) Where the light of honesty shines, the darkness of deception vanishes.
('36', 474, 1, 11, 936797) The moment a man of spiritual knowledge devoted to dharma sees a deceitful man, his heart melts with compassion.
('36', 474, 1, 12, 936910) How can one who has seen the self in him fail to understand another person?
('36', 474, 1, 13, 936986) I cannot say that the Poet always demonstrated this truth in his life.
('36', 474, 1, 14, 937057) People did occasionally cheat him in the name of religion.
('36', 474, 1, 15, 937116) Such instances do not prove any flaw in the principles, but suggest how very difficult it is to acquire spiritual knowledge of absolute purity.
('36', 474, 1, 16, 937260) Despite these limitations, I have not observed in anyone else such a beautiful combination of practical ability and devotion to dharma as I did in the Poet.
('36', 474, 2, 17, 937417) CHAPTER 5: DHARMA
('36', 474, 3, 18, 937435) Before we examine Raychandbhai’s life of dharma, it is necessary to discuss the nature of dharma as explained by him.
('36', 474, 3, 19, 937553) Dharma does not mean any particular creed or dogma.
('36', 474, 3, 20, 937605) Nor does it mean reading or learning by rote books known as Shastras or even believing all that they say.
('36', 474, 3, 21, 937711) Dharma is a quality of the soul and is present, visibly or invisibly, in every human being.
('36', 474, 3, 22, 937803) Through it we know our duty in human life and our ture relation with other souls.
('36', 474, 3, 23, 937885) It is evident that we cannot do so till we have known the self in us.
('36', 474, 3, 24, 937955) Hence dharma is the means by which we can know ourselves.
('36', 474, 3, 25, 938013) We may accept this means from wherever we get it, whether from India or Europe or Arabia.
('36', 474, 3, 26, 938103) Anyone who has studied the scriptures of different faiths will say that the general nature of this
('36', 475, 0, 1, 938202) 476 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 475, 1, 2, 938244) means as expounded in them is the same.
('36', 475, 1, 3, 938284) No Shastra in any religion says that we may speak untruth or follow it in practice, nor that we may commit violence.
('36', 475, 1, 4, 938401) Stating the quintessence of all Shastras, Shan karacharya said:”Brahma satyam jaganmithya” 1 The Koran e Sharif says the same thing in different words when it asserts that God is one and alone, and that nothing beside Him exists.
('36', 475, 1, 5, 938631) The Bible says:”I and my Father are one.” All these are different statements of the same truth.
('36', 475, 1, 6, 938727) But imperfect human beings, expounding this one truth through their various understandings, have erected veritable prison houses from which our minds have to escape.
('36', 475, 1, 7, 938893) We, imperfect human beings, try to go forward with the help of others less imperfect than we, and imagine that beyond a certain stage there is no further way to go.
('36', 475, 1, 8, 939058) In truth it is not so at all.
('36', 475, 1, 9, 939088) After a certain stage is reached, the Shastras give no help; experience alone helps then.
('36', 475, 1, 10, 939178) Hence sang Raychandbhai:
('36', 475, 2, 11, 939203) That state the Blessed one who has attained perfection of knowledge
('36', 475, 3, 12, 939271) sees in his vision,
('36', 475, 4, 13, 939291) But cannot describe in words;
('36', 475, 5, 14, 939321) I have fixed my eyes on that supreme state as my goal,
('36', 475, 6, 15, 939376) But at present it is an aspiration beyond my power to realize 2. Ultimately, therefore, it is the atman which wins moksha for itself.
('36', 475, 7, 16, 939510) Raychandbhai has expounded this essential truth in numerous ways in his writings.
('36', 475, 7, 17, 939592) He had made a deep study of a number of books on dharma.
('36', 475, 7, 18, 939649) He could follow Sanskrit and Magadhi languages without any difficulty.
('36', 475, 7, 19, 939720) He had studied Vedanta, as also the Bhagavata and the Gita.
('36', 475, 7, 20, 939780) As for books on Jain religion, he used to read every such book that he came across.
('36', 475, 7, 21, 939864) His capacity for reading and absorbing was inexhaustible.
('36', 475, 7, 22, 939922) He found one reading enough for grasping the substance of a book.
('36', 475, 7, 23, 939988) He had also read in translation the Koran and the Zend Avesta.
('36', 475, 8, 24, 940051) He used to tell me that he was inclined towards Jain philosophy.
('36', 475, 8, 25, 940116) He believed that the Jinagamas 3 contained the perfection of spiritual knowledge.
('36', 475, 8, 26, 940198) It is necessary that I should state this view of his.
('36', 475, 8, 27, 940252) I look upon myself as altogether unqualified to express an opinion on it.
('36', 475, 9, 28, 940326) 1 The Brahma alone is real, the world of appearance is false.
('36', 475, 10, 29, 940388) 2 Probably, through a slip of memory, Gandhiji has here brought together the first two lines of stanza 20 and the first two of stanza 21. 3 Sacred books of the Jains
('36', 476, 0, 1, 940554) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 477
('36', 476, 1, 2, 940599) Raychandbhai did not, however, lack respect for other faiths.
('36', 476, 1, 3, 940661) He even felt admiration for Vedanta.
('36', 476, 1, 4, 940698) A vedantin 1 would naturally take the Poet to be a vedantin.
('36', 476, 1, 5, 940759) In all his discussions with me, he never told me that if I wished to attain moksha I should follow a particular dharma and no other.
('36', 476, 1, 6, 940892) He advised me only to pay attention to my actions.
('36', 476, 1, 7, 940943) When we discussed what books I should read, he took into consideration my personal inclination and the early family influences on me and advised me to continue the Gita which I was then reading.
('36', 476, 1, 8, 941138) Other books which he suggested were Panchikaran, Maniratnamala, the chapter on Vairagya in Yogavasistha, Kavyadohan Part I, and Mokshamala composed by himself.
('36', 476, 1, 9, 941298) Raychandbhai used to say that the different faiths were like so many walled enclosures in which men and women were confined.
('36', 476, 1, 10, 941423) He whose one aim in life is to attain moksha need not give exclusive devotion to a particular faith.
('36', 476, 2, 11, 941524) Live as you will,
('36', 476, 3, 12, 941542) Attain to Hari anyhow.
('36', 476, 3, 13, 941565) This was Raychandbhai’s principle too, as it was Akha’s 2. He was always bored by religious controversy and rarely engaged himself in it.
('36', 476, 3, 14, 941703) He would study and understand the excellence of each faith and explain it to the followers of that faith.
('36', 476, 3, 15, 941809) Through my correspondence with him from South Africa, too, this is the lesson which I learned from him.
('36', 476, 3, 16, 941913) My own belief is that every religion is perfect from the point of view of its followers and imperfect from that of the followers of other faiths.
('36', 476, 3, 17, 942059) Examined from an independent point of view, every religion is both perfect and imperfect.
('36', 476, 3, 18, 942149) Beyond a certain stage, every Shastra becomes a fetter hindering further progress; but, then, that is the stage reached by one who has transcended the gunas.
('36', 476, 3, 19, 942307) If we follow Raychandbhai’s point of view, no one need give up his faith and embrace another.
('36', 476, 3, 20, 942401) Everyone may, following his own faith, win his freedom, that is, moksha, for to win moksha means to be perfectly free from attachments and aversions.

('36', 477, 9, 12, 943294) Today it is Diwali, and I am thinking of all of you.
('36', 477, 9, 13, 943347) These days, because of heavy pressure of work, I observe silence for two or three hours for writing letters.
('36', 477, 9, 14, 943456) There is no difficulty about writing as the hand moves quite well.
('36', 477, 9, 15, 943523) As far as you are concerned for the present my only wish is that you should get well.
('36', 477, 10, 16, 943609) I have your telegram concerning Pyarelal.
('36', 477, 10, 17, 943651) I think that for a few days you will have to manage as at present.
('36', 477, 10, 18, 943718) I do not know whether you can, but if it is more than a minor inconvenience write to me frankly.
('36', 477, 10, 19, 943815) I sent you a telegram.
('36', 477, 10, 20, 943838) I also sent one to Devdas.
('36', 477, 10, 21, 943865) I havereceived his telegram in reply.
('36', 477, 10, 22, 943903) He is willing to come.
('36', 477, 10, 23, 943926) He will be coming here on the 8th and then he will go back there.
('36', 477, 10, 24, 943992) He has asked my permission to go to Assam.
('36', 477, 10, 25, 944035) In that case it will be a problem to

('36', 478, 1, 2, 944200) decide whom I should assign to be with you.
('36', 478, 1, 3, 944244) But God will show the way.
('36', 478, 1, 4, 944271) I shall not leave it to you to choose a third person.
('36', 478, 1, 5, 944325) I will send anyone I can spare.
('36', 478, 1, 6, 944357) Pyare Ali must have met you.
('36', 478, 1, 7, 944386) He is a man with a pure heart.
('36', 478, 1, 8, 944417) At least to me his wife appeared to be a saintly lady.
('36', 478, 2, 9, 944472) Remind Taramati again that she has to write to me now and then.
('36', 478, 2, 10, 944536) I have already written to you that I had mentioned the name Rohit by mistake.
('36', 478, 2, 11, 944614) But both the names can perhaps remain?
('36', 478, 2, 12, 944653) That young man is having the rare benefit of the climate there.
('36', 478, 2, 13, 944717) Does Taramati go for walks?
('36', 478, 2, 14, 944745) Anybody who does not go for walks in Panchgani should be considered a criminal.

('36', 478, 5, 20, 945074) A Happy New Year to you all and may all your wishes be fulfilled.
('36', 478, 5, 21, 945140) I am not aware of Diwali or any other festival.
('36', 478, 5, 22, 945188) All the days are either festivals or days of gloom.
('36', 478, 5, 23, 945240) If our soul is blissful, then it is festival.
('36', 478, 5, 24, 945286) If the soul in pursuit of passion is sad, it is a day of gloom in spite of it being a festival.

('36', 478, 10, 31, 945596) I have glanced through it.

('36', 479, 1, 4, 945952) I do not have the ability to write such an introduction.
('36', 479, 1, 5, 946009) I do not have the necessary knowledge of Tamil.
('36', 479, 1, 6, 946057) I cannot even say if the translation is accurate or not.

('36', 479, 7, 13, 946321) BHAI GHANSHYAMDASJI,
('36', 479, 8, 14, 946342) I was very much pleased to have your long letter.
('36', 479, 8, 15, 946392) I had heard slanderous remarks made about you.
('36', 479, 8, 16, 946439) I did not believe them, but your letter has completely satisfied me.
('36', 479, 8, 17, 946508) They said that you took work by giving Rs. 500 2 instead of a hundred.
('36', 479, 8, 18, 946579) From what you have written, I have nothing to say.
('36', 479, 9, 19, 946630) As for Geneva, I must advise you to be patient.
('36', 479, 9, 20, 946678) I see no great benefit in your going there.
('36', 479, 9, 21, 946722) If the experience of the West is necessary, go on your own.
('36', 479, 9, 22, 946782) You will have many occasions to go.
('36', 479, 9, 23, 946818) But my inner self says it is not today.
('36', 479, 9, 24, 946858) In the end you should do what your conscience dictates.

('36', 480, 3, 5, 947325) 542. IS THIS HUMANITY?—V 2
('36', 480, 4, 6, 947352) [November 7, 1926] 3
('36', 480, 5, 7, 947373) A friend writes a long letter mentioning his difficulties and pointing out what Jainism has to say to him, a shrawak, in the matter.
('36', 480, 5, 8, 947506) One of his questions is:
('36', 480, 6, 9, 947531) You say that if we can niether take individual charge of roving dogs nor have a pinjrapole for them, the only alternative is to kill them.
('36', 480, 6, 10, 947670) Does that
('36', 480, 7, 11, 947680) mean that every roving dog should be killed, although it may not be rabid?
('36', 480, 7, 12, 947755) Don’t you agree that we leave unmolested all harmful beasts, birds and reptiles, so long as they do not actually harm us?
('36', 480, 7, 13, 947877) Why should the dogs be an exception?
('36', 480, 7, 14, 947914) Where is the humanity of shooting innocent dogs whenever they are found roving?
('36', 480, 7, 15, 947994) How can one wishing well to all living beings do this?
('36', 480, 7, 16, 948049) The writer has misunderstood my meaning.
('36', 480, 7, 17, 948090) I would not suggest even the destruction of rabid dogs for the sake of it, much less that of innocent, roving dogs.
('36', 480, 7, 18, 948206) Nor have I said that these latter should be killed wherever they are found.
('36', 480, 7, 19, 948282) I have only suggested legislation to that effect, so that as soon as the law is made, humane people might wake up in the matter and devise measures for the better management of stray dogs.
('36', 480, 7, 20, 948471) Some of these might be owned, some might be put in quarantine.
('36', 480, 7, 21, 948534) The remedy, when it is taken, will be once for all.
('36', 480, 7, 22, 948586) Stray dogs do not drop down from heaven.
('36', 480, 7, 23, 948627) They are a sign of the idleness, indifference and ignorance of society.
('36', 480, 7, 24, 948699) When they grow into a nuisance, it is due to our ignorance and want of compassion.
('36', 480, 7, 25, 948782) A stray dog is bound to take to his heels if you do not feed him.
('36', 480, 7, 26, 948848) The measure that I have suggested is actuated no less by a consideration of the welfare of the dogs than by that of society.
('36', 480, 7, 27, 948973) It is the duty of a
('36', 480, 8, 28, 948993) 1 C. R. Das 2 Originally written in Gujarati, the articles were translated into English by Mahadev Desai.
('36', 480, 8, 29, 949099) 3 The articles are placed according to the dates of their publication in Nav ajivan.
('36', 481, 0, 1, 949184) 482 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 481, 1, 2, 949226) humanitarian to allow no living being aimlessly to roam about.
('36', 481, 1, 3, 949289) In performance of that duty it may be his duty once in a way to kill some dogs.
('36', 481, 1, 4, 949369) Here is another question:
('36', 481, 2, 5, 949395) I agree that the dogs are sure to be killed by man whenever they become a menace to society.
('36', 481, 2, 6, 949488) But you say, ‘To wait until they get rabid is not to be merciful to them.’ This means that every dog is potentially rabid and that therefore it should be killed as a matter of precaution.
('36', 481, 2, 7, 949676) I met a friend from the Ashram who assured me that you did not mean this, and that you had suggested it only as a last resort when dogs had become a menace.
('36', 481, 2, 8, 949833) This is not clear from your articles.
('36', 481, 2, 9, 949871) Will you make it clear?
('36', 481, 3, 10, 949895) My previous articles and my answer to the first question leave nothing to be cleared.
('36', 481, 3, 11, 949981) I must explain what I mean when you say that you cannot wait on until the dog gets rabid.
('36', 481, 3, 12, 950071) Every stray dog is harmful.
('36', 481, 3, 13, 950099) The harm is [not] confined to cities alone and it must stop.
('36', 481, 3, 14, 950160) We do not wait until the serpent bites us.
('36', 481, 3, 15, 950203) The rabies of the dog is concealed in its capacity to bite.
('36', 481, 3, 16, 950263) A friend has sent me figures of cases of hydrophobia treated in the Civil hospital, Ahmedabad:
('36', 481, 4, 17, 950358) Cases Cases
('36', 481, 5, 18, 950370) Period from the city from the district Total
('36', 481, 6, 19, 950415) to Dec ’25 194 923 1,117
('36', 481, 7, 20, 950440) to Sept.’26 295 695 990
('36', 481, 8, 21, 950464) These figures must alarm everyone who is interested in the welfare of the community, especially if he is a humanitarian.
('36', 481, 8, 22, 950585) I admit that all the cases may not have been of hydrophobia.
('36', 481, 8, 23, 950646) But it is difficult to say whether a dog is or is not rabid, and many run in fear to the hospital, because most dogs are found to be rabid afterwards.
('36', 481, 8, 24, 950797) There is only one remedy to relieve them of this fear and it is not to allow dogs to roam about.
('36', 481, 9, 25, 950894) I was in England 40 years ago when effective measures were taken to stamp out rabies.
('36', 481, 9, 26, 950980) There were, of course, no stray dogs there.
('36', 481, 9, 27, 951024) But even for the dogs which had regular owners, an order was passed that dogs found without collars with the name and address of the owner thereon and without muzzles would be killed.
('36', 481, 9, 28, 951208) The measure was taken purely in the public interest.
('36', 481, 9, 29, 951261) Practically the next day all the dogs in London were found to be with collars and muzzles.
('36', 481, 9, 30, 951352) It was, therefore, necessary to kill only a very few.
('36', 481, 9, 31, 951406) If anyone thinks that the people in the West are innocent of humanity, he is sadly mistaken.
('36', 482, 0, 1, 951499) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 483
('36', 482, 1, 2, 951544) The ideal of humanity in the West is perhaps lower, but their practice of it is very much more thorough than ours.
('36', 482, 1, 3, 951659) We rest content with a lofty ideal and are slow or lazy in its practice.
('36', 482, 1, 4, 951732) We are wrapped in deep darkness, as is evident from our paupers, cattle and other animals.
('36', 482, 1, 5, 951823) They are eloquent of our irreligion rather than of religion.
('36', 482, 1, 6, 951884) Here is a third question:
('36', 482, 2, 7, 951910) You have different definitions of religion for the individual and for society.
('36', 482, 2, 8, 951989) But why should not religion in both cases be the same?
('36', 482, 2, 9, 952044) The ideal ought to be the same for both.
('36', 482, 2, 10, 952085) That it may be impossible to carry it out is a different matter.
('36', 482, 2, 11, 952150) For, even in case of the individual, only the occasion can show how far he has been able to carry out his ideal in practice.
('36', 482, 2, 12, 952275) You yourself have said that your ideal is to save even a cruel animal at the risk of your life, but you could not say what you would actually do when faced by such an animal.
('36', 482, 2, 13, 952450) There is no reason why society should not similarly have a lofty ideal and leave the individuals free to practise it according to their capacity.
('36', 482, 2, 14, 952596) My definition of religion for the individual and for society is the same.
('36', 482, 2, 15, 952670) The ideal must always be the same, but the practice I have conceived to be different in the case of the individual and the society.
('36', 482, 2, 16, 952802) Truly speaking, practice differs in case of every individual.
('36', 482, 2, 17, 952864) I do not know of two men having the same extent of the practice of ahimsa, though their definition of ahimsa is the same.
('36', 482, 2, 18, 952986) The extent of practice in case of society is the average of the different capacities of its members.
('36', 482, 2, 19, 953087) Thus, for instance, where a section of the society is milk arian and the other fruitarain, the practice for the society extends to the use of milk and fruit.
('36', 482, 3, 20, 953245) The writer next sets out two Jain doctrines as follows:
('36', 482, 4, 21, 953301) Jainism is based on the doctrine of syadvada—manysidedness of
('36', 482, 5, 22, 953363) reality.
('36', 482, 5, 23, 953372) As is aptly said: ‘No absolute rule is correct; only the relative rule is the correct rule.’ Which means that an act which may be described as himsa
('36', 482, 6, 24, 953521) under certain circumstances may be ahimsa under other circumstances.
('36', 482, 6, 25, 953590) Man should always use his discrimination in determining his conduct.
('36', 482, 6, 26, 953659) There are two classes of Jains.
('36', 482, 6, 27, 953691) Sadhus (the monks) and shrawaks (the laity).
('36', 482, 6, 28, 953736) Their code of
('36', 482, 7, 29, 953750) conduct is thus defined: The sadhu is always non violent.
('36', 482, 7, 30, 953808) He may not eat to save himself, may not cook for himself, may not walk even a step for his own purpose—all his activity is for the welfare of the community and it should be as harmless as possible.
('36', 482, 7, 31, 954006) He has to avoid the 42 infringements laid down in the Shastras.
('36', 482, 7, 32, 954070) The sadhu is described as nirgrantha—free from bonds.
('36', 482, 7, 33, 954124) So far as I
('36', 482, 8, 34, 954136) know there is no sadhu today who can satisfy the definition of a sadhu given above.
('36', 483, 0, 1, 954220) 484 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 483, 1, 2, 954262) The shrawak may not kill or injure any living being, except when it is
('36', 483, 2, 3, 954333) essential for himself.
('36', 483, 2, 4, 954356) He is a worldly man and he cannot take his humanity farther than this.
('36', 483, 2, 5, 954427) So if 20 per cent compassion is expected of the Sadhu, 1.25 per cent is expected of the shrawak.
('36', 483, 2, 6, 954524) If the latter goes beyond the measure expected of him he approaches the state of a sadhu, but as a shrawak nothing
('36', 483, 3, 7, 954639) more is expected of him.
('36', 483, 3, 8, 954664) I knew the substance of this distincition.
('36', 483, 3, 9, 954707) I am quite conscious that the Jain doctrine is not contrary to the opinion I have expressed in these articles.
('36', 483, 3, 10, 954818) If the Jains accept the interpretation given above, the opinion expressed by me can be deduced from it.
('36', 483, 3, 11, 954922) But whether they accept it or not, I humbly submit that my opinion is capable of being, and has been, independently justified.

('36', 483, 4, 13, 955073) 543. ABOUT MADHADA ASHRAM
('36', 483, 5, 14, 955099) Bhai Shivji had sent to the newspapers a statement in reply to my article 1 regarding Madhada Ashram and himself.
('36', 483, 5, 15, 955213) This statement he has now sent to me for publication; but as it has already appeared in the daily newspapers, I see no need to publish it here.
('36', 483, 5, 16, 955357) However, as a certain portion of it referring to his relations with me is of interest to the public, I give below my reply to it.
('36', 483, 5, 17, 955487) I was sad to read Bhai Shivji’s statement.
('36', 483, 5, 18, 955530) He has adopted the proverbial method of the thief attacking the warder.
('36', 483, 5, 19, 955602) There are no differences of opinion between Bhai Shivji and myself.
('36', 483, 5, 20, 955670) But I have formed a certain opinion regarding his character and his management of affairs on the basis of Shivji’s own confessions.
('36', 483, 5, 21, 955802) This opinion I conveyed to the executive committee of the Kathiawar Political Conference, and I proposed, as I felt bound, to publish it in the Navajivan.
('36', 483, 5, 22, 955957) But before I did so, I wrote to Bhai Shivji, so as to avoid any injustice being done to him.
('36', 483, 5, 23, 956050) The question before me was whether I should or should not publish my opinion about Bhai Shivji.
('36', 483, 5, 24, 956146) This cannot be described as a difference of opinion.
('36', 483, 5, 25, 956199) It was certainly I who suggested the idea of the Panch.
('36', 483, 5, 26, 956255) That was for Bhai Shivji’s satisfaction and not for mine.
('36', 483, 5, 27, 956313) There are no allegations against me.
('36', 483, 5, 28, 956350) Being a public worker I had the duty of making an inquiry into the charges against a colleague.
('36', 483, 5, 29, 956446) I started the

('36', 484, 0, 1, 956494) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 485
('36', 484, 1, 2, 956539) inquiry and, as it was being made, I kept Bhai Shivji informed about it.
('36', 484, 1, 3, 956612) Finally, I had a meeting with him, and in view of the confessions which he then made there remained nothing more for me to do.
('36', 484, 1, 4, 956739) Bhai Shivji was found guilty on his own admission.
('36', 484, 1, 5, 956790) When the case was placed before the committee of the Conference on the same day, and when it became imperative for me to publish it in the Navajivan, Bhai Shivji changed his attitude.
('36', 484, 1, 6, 956974) If Bhai Shivji or any of his friends wish to know from me the details of the confessions made by Shivji, together with the details of the inquiry that I had made, then I am willing to write to them these details.
('36', 484, 1, 7, 957187) Bhai Shivji and his friends are at liberty to publish my correspondence with them or with others on this matter.
('36', 484, 1, 8, 957300) I do not wish to bore the readers by publishing it myself.
('36', 484, 2, 9, 957359) I must, however, say that Bhai Shivji’s behaviour in every respect, after my inquiry about him, has confirmed my opinion against him.
('36', 484, 2, 10, 957493) First, I was the judge and others were the complainants.
('36', 484, 2, 11, 957550) They had given money to Bhai Shivji.
('36', 484, 2, 12, 957587) When my viewpoint became unacceptable to Bhai Shivji, even I was declared to be a complainant.
('36', 484, 2, 13, 957682) Now Bhai Shivji, in his statement, seems to consider me at fault.
('36', 484, 2, 14, 957748) But he and all those who are interested in the social workers obeying more or less the rules and regulations of morality, and who desire faultless management of public funds should know that the proposal to appoint the Panch was for the benefit of Bhai Shivji.
('36', 484, 2, 15, 958009) He is still guilty in my opinion.
('36', 484, 2, 16, 958043) His lapses are grave and he has confessed most of them.
('36', 484, 2, 17, 958099) The panchnama 1, which I could never have signed, was drawn up as far as I know, by Bhai Shivji himself.
('36', 484, 2, 18, 958204) By issuing this statement Bhai Shivji has added salt to the wound and made his guilt worse.

('36', 486, 3, 4, 959934) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter.
('36', 486, 3, 5, 959976) 1 It may flatter my pride, but I hope I have none.
('36', 486, 3, 6, 960027) I am conscious of my unfitness and limitations.
('36', 486, 3, 7, 960075) If there was the slightest chance of successful intervention, my seclusion would not deter me.
('36', 486, 3, 8, 960170) But I see none.
('36', 486, 3, 9, 960186) I therefore remain still and pray.

('36', 486, 8, 16, 960544) MY DEAR C. R.,
('36', 486, 9, 17, 960559) Your letter.
('36', 486, 9, 18, 960572) The dogs are giving enough food for Navajivan.
('36', 486, 9, 19, 960619) They have also increased the sale of postage stamps.
('36', 486, 9, 20, 960672) And it is all to the good.
('36', 486, 10, 21, 960699) Chhotalal leaves for your place on 16th.
('36', 486, 10, 22, 960740) So he thinks.
('36', 486, 10, 23, 960754) He won’t be happy till he gets there.
('36', 486, 10, 24, 960792) He is a beautiful, restless soul.
('36', 486, 10, 25, 960826) Work, work, work.
('36', 486, 10, 26, 960844) I think you should come to Wardha.
('36', 486, 10, 27, 960879) It is a long journey but, if you can at all spare yourself, do come.
('36', 486, 10, 28, 960948) Not to go to Gauhati is a sound decision.
('36', 486, 11, 29, 960990) 1 Syed Zahirul Haq of Barh, Patna, had, in an open letter dated October 25, 1926, drawn Gandhiji’s attention to the communal riots in Howrah on the occasion of Durga Puja and appealed to him to”leave your Ashram and rescue the people as a saviour of the nation from the deep ditch they are going to fall into”.
('36', 486, 11, 30, 961301) The ‘open letter’ as well as Gandhiji’s reply was published in The Hindu under the caption:”Hindu Muslim Disharmony: Mahatmaji’s Reply to Call for Intervention”.
('36', 486, 11, 31, 961463) The correspondence was also published in The Searchlight, 26 11 1926.
('36', 486, 12, 32, 961533) 2 The reference obviously is to the series of articles published under the title”Is This Humanity?”.

('36', 487, 7, 8, 961941) November 10, 1926
('36', 487, 8, 9, 961959) MY DEAR VAZE,
('36', 487, 9, 10, 961973) I have your letter.
('36', 487, 9, 11, 961993) Benarsidas anticipated you and sent me a copy of your letter to him.
('36', 487, 9, 12, 962062) The reason he has given me for his wishing to join [you] does not appeal to me.
('36', 487, 9, 13, 962142) 1 He has unnecessarily impoverished himself and now thinks that he will have a better career as a journalist if he goes to South Africa.
('36', 487, 9, 14, 962279) I totally dissent from the view.
('36', 487, 9, 15, 962312) Apart from his reason, however, his going to South Africa with you appeals to me.
('36', 487, 9, 16, 962394) And if you and he think that he should go, I suggest Shastriar 2 writing to Mrs. Naidu or J. B. Petit for the fare.
('36', 487, 9, 17, 962510) I think you will get it for the asking.
('36', 487, 10, 18, 962550) You hardly need any recommendation from me when you have Andrews there.
('36', 487, 10, 19, 962622) My son 3 too is there.
('36', 487, 10, 20, 962645) But here is one letter, though you do not need even that.
('36', 487, 10, 21, 962703) You must have heard about him from G. It was at his villa that we stayed in Johannesburg.
('36', 487, 11, 22, 962793) Yours sincerely,

('36', 489, 4, 5, 963884) BRAILSFORD,
('36', 489, 5, 6, 963896) NEAR DERBY, June 29, 1926
('36', 489, 6, 7, 963922) DEAR MR. GANDHI,
('36', 489, 7, 8, 963939) I am most grateful for your letter.
('36', 489, 7, 9, 963975) My great difficulty, in which I am most anxious for your advice, is this.
('36', 489, 7, 10, 964049) I am a member of the committee set up by the Independent Labour Party to determine what policy that party should pursue in regard to India.
('36', 489, 7, 11, 964189) The I.L.P is a constituent part of the Labour Party and contains the great majority of its most active members.
('36', 489, 7, 12, 964301) It is definitely anti Imperialist, by contrast with a group in the Labour Party which would have the party make no distinct break with past traditions.
('36', 489, 7, 13, 964453) Hitherto most of the things that the I.L.P. has urged the Labour Party to adopt, it has adopted.
('36', 489, 7, 14, 964550) But the time is near when there will be a struggle between I.L.P. ideas and Imperialist ideas in the L.P. When that struggle comes a great deal will depend on whether we can prove our policy to be practicable.
('36', 489, 7, 15, 964760) If for example our opponents can say “what is the use of arousing the enmity of British people in India for the sake of a policy which Indians themselves don’t want and wouldn’t act upon?”—then the people who say “let things go on as they are until Indians learn more sense” will prevail in the Labour Party.
('36', 489, 7, 16, 965069) And that would mean an end to any hope of fraternal relations for many years, since Labour Governments in this country would have no reason to behave to[wards] India differently from Conservative Governments.
('36', 489, 7, 17, 965278) For these reasons it does seem to me important that this committee should reach the right conclusions.
('36', 489, 7, 18, 965381) I ask you to tell me what these conclusions should be.
('36', 489, 7, 19, 965436) What should the next Labour Government do about India?
('36', 489, 7, 20, 965491) The obvious answer is that they should do as Indians themselves wish, and of course the ignorant among us are content with that answer.
('36', 489, 7, 21, 965627) Those who like me know a little more, know that in no country are those who love their country in agreement about even the chief political measures and steps to be taken.
('36', 489, 7, 22, 965798) And it is painfully evident that the disagreements in India are deeper and wider than usual.
('36', 489, 7, 23, 965891) Does that fact make the problem—our problem in this country, I mean not yours in your country— insoluble?
('36', 489, 7, 24, 965997) In answer I think we ought both to admit that in the cases of past nationalist movements success was attained only when some organized body of men had won the support of the great majority of those who were ready to make sacrificesfor their country’s liberty.
('36', 489, 7, 25, 966257) In Italy for example, national liberty was won only when the policy of Cavour and Garibaldi prevailed in the minds of the Italians over the policy of Mazzini.
('36', 489, 7, 26, 966416) (I believe Mazzini was right and Cavour wrong but that is irrelevent.)
('36', 490, 0, 1, 966487) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 491
('36', 490, 1, 2, 966532) Foreigners were able to help the Italians to independence only because there were conspicuous people to deal with who were known to have the support, not of all Italians but of so large a proportion of them that they could speak for Italy.
('36', 490, 1, 3, 966772) Nothing of that sort is apparently imaginable in India for many years.
('36', 490, 1, 4, 966843) What then can the friends of India do?
('36', 490, 1, 5, 966882) So far as I can see there are only two possible answers.
('36', 490, 1, 6, 966939) They can arbitrarily choose some group of men in India with definite views and a programme so fully and carefully worked out that its practicability is tolerably certain, adopt that policy and hope that its adoption by Socialist opinion in Britain will result in its gradually gaining ground in India until it can be acted on.
('36', 490, 1, 7, 967266) Or, they could simply frame a policy of their own, drafting a constitution which in their opinion would work and would also perhaps win support from men in India who find nothing to admire in one another’s proposals.
('36', 490, 1, 8, 967483) Which of these solutions do you prefer?
('36', 490, 1, 9, 967523) Or is there another, a third, outside my range of vision?
('36', 490, 1, 10, 967581) The second alternative appears presumptuous, but it must be remembered that we in this country have an unprecedented experience, not only of the operation of democratic institutions but of the framing of constitutions for other countries.
('36', 490, 2, 11, 967820) There is one isolated point you raise on which I should be specially grateful for further information.
('36', 490, 2, 12, 967923) You suggest that the British authorities may partly be responsible for the communal strife.
('36', 490, 2, 13, 968015) I can understand that an administrative act like the partition of Bengal might aggravate it.
('36', 490, 2, 14, 968108) But I cannot understand how any agent of government could possibly influence the people who actually engage in strife.
('36', 490, 2, 15, 968227) The important question to ask is what a Labour Government could do to put an end to those actions of its agents in India, whatever they may be, which increase hatred between Hindu and Muslim.
('36', 490, 2, 16, 968419) It obviously could not replace most of these agents by men sympathetic with Indian liberty.
('36', 490, 2, 17, 968511) What less drastic steps could it take?
('36', 490, 3, 18, 968550) If you are going to be so generous with your time and energy as to answer this letter, please do not trouble to follow my arguments in detail.
('36', 490, 3, 19, 968693) I have shown you whether my mind has been drawn by the facts, only because I could explain our perplexity in no other way.
('36', 490, 3, 20, 968816) In your answer I beg you to think of one thing only, how you would act if your name were not Gandhi but Leys, and God had given you some responsibility for coming to decisions which conceivably may become the decisions upon which some day a British Government may act.
('36', 490, 3, 21, 969085) What arguments would you use with those whose remedy is to leave alone?
('36', 490, 3, 22, 969157) And just what, as precisely as possible, would you advocate if in my place?
('36', 490, 3, 23, 969233) I hope the comparison between us, that suggests that in my place you might conceivably think as I do.
('36', 490, 3, 24, 969335) will not vex you.
('36', 490, 3, 25, 969353) If mankind is a single family, none of the differences between its members should prevent them from helping one another.

('36', 491, 2, 3, 969611) BRAILSFORD,
('36', 491, 3, 4, 969623) NEAR DERBY, August 9, 1926
('36', 491, 4, 5, 969650) DEAR MR. GANDHI, Your letter gives me real hope that with your help Socialists in this country may discover what it is their duty to do in regard to India.
('36', 491, 4, 6, 969806) But do not imagine that I am “called upon to lead or guide the I.L.P”.
('36', 491, 4, 7, 969877) I am merely one out of about a dozen members of that party who because they have had some special experience have been asked by their fellow members to explore and discover what the duty of the whole party is.
('36', 491, 4, 8, 970087) Will you allow the other members of the committee to read your letters, on condition that they must not get into print?
('36', 491, 4, 9, 970207) Your explanation of the difference between the various Indian parties and their programmes is most important.
('36', 491, 4, 10, 970317) It has cleared away one mystery from my mind.
('36', 491, 4, 11, 970363) Even more important is your prescription for the solution of the problem a Labour Government would have to meet in India.
('36', 491, 4, 12, 970485) You would have such a government choose some one person to first of all confer with the leaders of Indian opinion and then decide on a constitution and programme which his party would impose on India.
('36', 491, 4, 13, 970686) Public opinion would disapprove of a single person being given such a task.
('36', 491, 4, 14, 970762) But I see no reason against its being given to a committee of three or four persons.
('36', 491, 4, 15, 970847) There are of course immense difficulties in the way of your solution (which is identical with the second alternative in my last letter) but the great thing about it is that it is a real solution.
('36', 491, 4, 16, 971043) The difficulties are of two sorts.
('36', 491, 4, 17, 971078) One sort is inherent in British politics.
('36', 491, 4, 18, 971120) Committees with us are representative.
('36', 491, 4, 19, 971159) They are samples of a variety of types of mind.
('36', 491, 4, 20, 971207) But a committee to draw up a constitution for India would have to be composed of men with the same mind.
('36', 491, 4, 21, 971312) Important differences among its members would wreck its work.
('36', 491, 4, 22, 971374) A greater difficulty would be to get the Labour Government to entrust the task to men who would disregard everything but the needs of India.
('36', 491, 4, 23, 971515) The last Labour Government stultified itself by fear.
('36', 491, 4, 24, 971569) It was afraid, not only of its enemies but of its own programme.
('36', 491, 4, 25, 971634) I know Lord Oliver to be a true friend to India.
('36', 491, 4, 26, 971683) But I feel sure he would admit now that if he had risked his all in framing even in bare outlines, a really democratic constitution, and urging it on his cabinet, he would have done the right thing.
('36', 491, 4, 27, 971882) But even you cannot realize the storm it would create if the next Labour Government gave the Indian problem to be solved by men who sought a solution that would conform to two conditions and these two only, viz., that their constitution would work and that it would satisfy the bulk of Indian opinion.
('36', 491, 4, 28, 972184) Unless the I.L.P. leavens the whole Labour Party very rapidly the next Labour Government will leave India to some “safe” man, and, if it expects him, either alone or with one or two others, to make a constitution, will expect one that would buy off with compromises the less rabid imperialists.
('36', 491, 4, 29, 972479) The other sort of difficulty comes from your end.
('36', 491, 4, 30, 972529) You practically admit that
('36', 492, 0, 1, 972556) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 493
('36', 492, 1, 2, 972601) Muslims would resist by fighting if a democratic government were set up in India.
('36', 492, 1, 3, 972683) I believe that Islam and democracy are as incompatible as oil and water.
('36', 492, 1, 4, 972756) Do you expect that the rest of Indians would defend their political liberty against them?
('36', 492, 1, 5, 972846) Or are British troops to be called in?
('36', 492, 1, 6, 972885) In either case you must admit Muslim resistance would involve a kind of war, and that would mean that the blood of many innocents would be shed.
('36', 492, 2, 7, 973030) You put forward one suggestion that you think would help to diminish Muslim antagonism, “preference in education”.
('36', 492, 2, 8, 973145) Could you elaborate that idea?
('36', 492, 2, 9, 973176) We have a plan in this country whereby in secondary, i.e., more advanced, schools which get grants of public money, a large number of the scholars must be poor and must be given free education.
('36', 492, 2, 10, 973370) Is that the sort of thing you mean?
('36', 492, 2, 11, 973406) Would you have the constitution include clauses that would compel the Provincial Governments to give a proportion of such “free places” to Muslim children, according to the number of Muslims in the population?
('36', 492, 2, 12, 973616) Finally, there is insistent in my mind the dreadful question, to which I know there can be no answer, whether the inexperience of Indians will lead them to choose to represent them bad men, men who will deceive the people with flattery and others who will fill their own pockets.
('36', 492, 2, 13, 973896) We even in the Labour Party have many of the former class, no doubt some of the latter class.
('36', 492, 2, 14, 973990) If I were a member of a committee with the task of giving India self government—the idea is ridiculous of course—I should feel in my bones that the whole scheme might break down.
('36', 492, 2, 15, 974169) But I should also feel that the one chance of success lay in boldness, in throwing on the whole people of India more duties and more responsibility than they ask, in calling on them in effect to behave like free men.
('36', 492, 2, 16, 974386) Such a scheme most I.C.S. men would I suppose refuse to work.
('36', 492, 2, 17, 974448) Then would come the testing time.
('36', 492, 2, 18, 974482) I feel sure that Indians do exist to fill with efficiency the legislative, administrative and executive posts that will be vacant.
('36', 492, 2, 19, 974613) But will the Indian people choose these men and not others, or rather choose enough of them to enable the machinery of government to work well enough to prevent new tyrannies arising, whether a new Akbar or a new Curzon is no matter?
('36', 492, 2, 20, 974847) Most gratefully yours,
('36', 492, 3, 21, 974870) NORMAN LEYS [PS.]
('36', 492, 4, 22, 974888) It is quite impossible for me to visit India.
('36', 492, 4, 23, 974934) A number of much more important people in the party have of course done as you suggest and have done all they could to discover what Indians would wish a Labour Government to do in India.

('36', 493, 1, 2, 975194) APPENDIX III LETTER FROM NORMAN LEYS
('36', 493, 2, 3, 975231) September 20, 1926
('36', 493, 3, 4, 975250) DEAR MR. GANDHI, I cannot find anything to differ from in your letter, although of course differences in histories and environments always leave their marks.
('36', 493, 3, 5, 975408) I am most grateful for the time and thought you have given to my questions and shall not hesitate in future to consult you when perplexed about Indian affairs.
('36', 493, 3, 6, 975568) I have recently got to know one of your disciples, Tarini P. Sinha.
('36', 493, 3, 7, 975636) He has recently been on a speaking tour among the miners who live about thirty miles from our house.
('36', 493, 3, 8, 975737) Ten days ago he was arrested for something he had said.
('36', 493, 3, 9, 975793) I went to him as soon as I heard of the arrest.
('36', 493, 3, 10, 975841) His case has been postponed for a fortnight and he will come to our house from London on the way to the court.
('36', 493, 3, 11, 975952) I have little doubt he will be discharged acquitted 1. The only sentence that the police seem to have objected to was a criticism of patriotism and I have no doubt at all that he made it quite clear that what he condemned was not love of one’s own country but the hatred of or even the slighting of other countries.
('36', 493, 3, 12, 976268) In fact the real reason for his arrest seems to have been the language used by a very young Englishman who had been accompanying Mr. Sinha, and was in the habit of using vulgar terms of abuse and even encouraging the miners to injure those of their number who had accepted the terms of the mine owners.
('36', 493, 3, 13, 976571) If Mr. Sinha had been an Englishman he would have declined to continue to speak from the same platform as this man unless he gave better advice.
('36', 493, 3, 14, 976716) But I think this man is sorry now.
('36', 493, 3, 15, 976751) One feature of your movement that we on this side of the world also share is the idea of restricting personal expenditure to an equal part of the national income.
('36', 493, 3, 16, 976914) I have been trying to do it for years, and failing most of the time.
('36', 493, 3, 17, 976983) Besides personal difficulties there are those which arise from the fact that family expenses are the chief trouble—and women are always more conservative than men.
('36', 493, 3, 18, 977147) Also I don’t think the idea a good one for the young, who ought to have more than an equal share.
('36', 493, 3, 19, 977245) But some day I hope there will be a fraternity in this country of people who, while living outwardly in every way like those who have taken no vow, pledge themselves not to spend their money on themselves.
('36', 493, 3, 20, 977451) I think I remember Mr. Andrews saying he had sent you last year one of the copies of my book I had sent him for distribution.
('36', 493, 3, 21, 977577) It is called Kenya.
('36', 493, 3, 22, 977597) But if you have no copy please let me know, if you would be so good as to let me give you one.
('36', 493, 3, 23, 977692) You will let me sign myself as we Socialists do.
('36', 493, 3, 24, 977741) Yours fraternally,

('36', 494, 1, 2, 977880) APPENDIX IV
('36', 494, 2, 3, 977892) (AN APPEAL)
('36', 494, 3, 4, 977904) MAHATMAJI,
('36', 494, 4, 5, 977915) You will, perhaps, be surprised and even annoyed at this somewhat unusual mode of approach to one who has never denied accessibility to the humblest of his followers.
('36', 494, 4, 6, 978082) Our only excuse for this method of addressing you is to be found in the present deplorable condition of our national politics, the distressing divisions and cross divisions of parties and principles, the clash of personalities and the clang of prejudice.
('36', 494, 4, 7, 978337) You are, of course, not unaware of this nor can any other Indian heart bleed as freely as yours must be bleeding at the distressful spectacle presented by the country.
('36', 494, 4, 8, 978505) But what, perhaps, we venture to think, is unknown to you and what we seek with all respect to bring to your notice, by this communication addressed through the medium of the Press, is the unspoken anxiety and eagerness of millions of your countrymen who have been long waiting for a lead from you, the one Indian who is a national figure and is trusted by all the warring communities and feared as well as respected by the Government.
('36', 494, 4, 9, 978941) These your countrymen are unable to voice their sentiments and make their appeal to you because they respect the self denying ordinance you have imposed on yourself.
('36', 494, 4, 10, 979107) Sir, if it be not presumptuous in your eyes that we thus constitute ourselves their spokesmen and plead with you to resume the reins that you have voluntarily surrendered, will you permit us to make this appeal, in the name of the unspeaking masses of India, in the name of those who, while you were still at the helm, followed your orders and instructions without cavil or question, in the name of those sacred principles of liberty, equality and fraternity which are being trampled under foot simply because the one man who could hold up his head and withstand the onslaught of reactionarism in these days of distress and despair is not there at his post?
('36', 494, 5, 11, 979765) Sir, our reasons for this appeal cannot be unknown to you.
('36', 494, 5, 12, 979824) We have been your followers ever since you started the campaign of non violent non co operation and we have not ceased to believe in the central basis of your war against the present system of government.
('36', 494, 5, 13, 980029) The country, probably, was not prepared to submit to the rigorous self discipline, the relentless self denial that the pursuit of your great ideal necessarily involved; and so in sheer despair at the unreadiness of your countrymen and despite the unspeakable anguish to yourself, you elected rather to countermand the campaign commencing at Bardoli than to proceed further at the cost of repeated and innumerable Chauri Chauras.
('36', 494, 5, 14, 980458) With your incarceration, Sir, commenced the decay of the strident sentiment of national solidarity and of the determined resolve to win national freedom.
('36', 494, 5, 15, 980612) Your release and the subsequent developments of the political situation are much too well known to need recall.
('36', 494, 5, 16, 980724) But the nation has watched with breathless suspense the triumph after triumph of the forces of reaction, the surrender after surrender which you seemed to be making rather than permit the country to be cast into the unfathomable pit of irremediable wrongs.
('36', 494, 5, 17, 980981) There are many, however, who have never understood the sublime self sacrifice dictating your actions ever since
('36', 495, 0, 1, 981093) 496 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 495, 1, 2, 981135) your unconditional release from jail and we express the sentiments of such doubters and waverers and the inarticulate but not insignificant millions as well as of ourselves when we say that the moment has come when you may, out of your infinite love for the motherland, make the greater sacrifice than all others you have made hitherto, of foregoing the vow you have imposed on yourself.
('36', 495, 2, 3, 981523) The more imperative reasons why the unquestioned leader of the Indian people should emerge at this critical juncture from his self imposed seclusion are also not lacking.
('36', 495, 2, 4, 981694) Besides the great, incalculable harm done to the soul of a country by foreign domination of the kind we are undergoing, India has today innumerable reasons to apprehend that, without a determined stand for their rights by her people, the interests of this country will be immolated on the altar of the greed of alien exploiters.
('36', 495, 2, 5, 982023) You will, we hope, pardon our pointing out the lesson of the recent happenings in the Legislative Assembly.
('36', 495, 2, 6, 982131) Because the Swarajists were absent, as a measure of their conjoint protest against the unruffled irresponsiveness of the bureaucracy, the Government dared to hasten with a Bill of prime importance to the material interests of the country, but the Swarajists, recognizing the immense importance of the Currency legislation, checkmated them by returning to the Assembly on the fateful day.
('36', 495, 2, 7, 982519) There are, however, countless directions in which the bureaucracy can and will do material harm to the interests of this country, in the absence of any check or control from the representatives of the people.
('36', 495, 2, 8, 982728) And if the latter are threatened with wholesale disintegration, as it seems too painfully evident by the recent attempts at Party mongering by every self styled leader and spokesman, there is a danger that, in the next Assembly and Councils, the anti Nationalist majority will be overwhelming.
('36', 495, 2, 9, 983022) The tragedy of the situation, however, is that such a majority will, as amatter of fact, reflect only a very small minority of the people of India.
('36', 495, 2, 10, 983170) For we are convinced that the country is, even now, nationalist to the core.
('36', 495, 2, 11, 983247) It only needs a leader who thinks their thoughts, hopes their hopes, feels their wrongs and fights their battle, without a thought for self.
('36', 495, 2, 12, 983388) Sir, such a leader is rare; but India is fortunate in having at least one such citizen, to wit, yourself.
('36', 495, 2, 13, 983494) Sir, we beg you in the name of your country, and for the reason not only of the wrongs it has already suffered but of those other countless wrongs it will be made to suffer, to forgo your vow of retirement, to abandon your resolve of self effacement, to listen to the call of your country and resume the helm that none can hold like you.
('36', 495, 2, 14, 983832) We are not making this prayer in the blind faith and the unreasoning feeling that somehow good will come of all the ills that oppress the world.
('36', 495, 2, 15, 983977) We know the chaos into which the country has fallen, but we think if you, Sir, will respond to this call, both men and material will be found in abundance once more to wage the war of our country’s liberation.
('36', 495, 3, 16, 984187) We have no desire to be invidious or personal.
('36', 495, 3, 17, 984234) We have no intention to criticize, to praise or censure individuals for this or that act in your absence or during your retirement.
('36', 495, 3, 18, 984366) We think the country has had enough of recriminations, and is ready to let bygones be bygones.
('36', 495, 3, 19, 984461) But to achieve that, also, we need a real leader by right of his divine gifts of leadership that no amount of newspaper advertisement or platform assertion will infuse in any man, if he be lacking in the same by nature.
('36', 495, 3, 20, 984681) And, if you
('36', 496, 0, 1, 984693) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 497
('36', 496, 1, 2, 984738) respond to this call, if you seek the modus operandi and a word by way of suggestion,—mere suggestion— is not unwelcome to you, may we mention that as the first act of your resumed authority, you should yourself call a fully representative conference,—representative not of individuals but of all the principles or interests that tear this country into hostile camps?
('36', 496, 1, 3, 985106) In such a conference there will be room enough for Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya as well as Sir Abdur Rahim, Mr. Jayakar 1
('36', 496, 2, 4, 985227) as well as Mr. Patel 2. Agitation has, we know, been set afoot of late to call a special session of our National Congress.
('36', 496, 2, 5, 985350) We submit, most respectfully, that such session is as inexpedient as it would be unfruitful.
('36', 496, 2, 6, 985443) For the Congress is necessarily bound by its constitution and rules of procedure that will not permit that unrestricted interchange of sentiments and views which seems to us to be the only way for clearing up the mass of misunderstanding and prejudice lying at the root of inter communal quarrels.
('36', 496, 2, 7, 985741) We are not unmindful of the fact that you, too, if you undertake to call a really representative conference of the kind we have ventured to suggest, will not be altogether exempt from a liability to censure.
('36', 496, 2, 8, 985949) But your motives are above suspicion; your action is bound to be national in the highest sense of the term; and, at the very worst, it is a chance of personal misunderstanding or misrepresentation, which, we feel, a man of your grandeur can afford to run, and must run, in view of the great interests at stake.
('36', 496, 2, 9, 986260) We have placed before you the country’s unexpressed wish, and we leave it now to you to act as it seems best to you, without, we trust, doubting, that we remain, as ever, your most respectful and dutiful followers.

('36', 496, 11, 18, 986804) September 9, 1926
('36', 496, 12, 19, 986822) MY DEAR MAHATMAJI, I am writing a book called Fourteen Years in South Africa which will contain a summary of my experiences there.
('36', 496, 12, 20, 986953) I therefore take the liberty of addressing to you the following questions: 1. When the Indian Location near Johannesburg was transferred to the
('36', 496, 13, 21, 987097) 1 M. R. Jayakar 2 Vithalbhai Patel
('36', 497, 0, 1, 987132) 498 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 497, 1, 2, 987174) municipality, had you on behalf of the Indians consented to the transfer?
('36', 497, 1, 3, 987248) 2. After the Location had been taken away, is it true that the municipality offered an alternative site to the Indians and that you advised the community not to accept it?
('36', 497, 1, 4, 987420) If so, could you give your reasons?
('36', 497, 1, 5, 987456) 3. Is it true that in connection with the Location you received £ 1,600/ from the municipality?
('36', 497, 1, 6, 987552) And did you also receive anything from the Indians?
('36', 497, 1, 7, 987604) 4. Was not the British Indian Association organized in place of the Transvaal Indian Association then existing in Johannesburg?
('36', 497, 1, 8, 987732) 5. If giving finger prints under compulsion was improper how was it proper to give them voluntarily?
('36', 497, 1, 9, 987833) I feel somewhat baffled.
('36', 497, 1, 10, 987858) Is there provision anywhere else in the world to take finger prints except from prisoners?
('36', 497, 1, 11, 987949) 6. If the Government wanted to stop unauthorized immigrants, couldn’t this have been done with the help of photographs, which is the means used for identification all the world over?
('36', 497, 1, 12, 988132) 7. About vested rights you once said: “By vested rights I understand the right of an Indian and his successors to live and trade in the township in which he was living and trading no matter how often he shifts his residence or business from place to place in the same township.” Does this not imply that a trader or his successor who has the right to trade in a certain township retains that right even if he frequently goes on changing premises?
('36', 497, 1, 13, 988579) Does not this also mean that save those actually engaged in trade or their successors “no other or no new” Indians would have any trading rights?
('36', 497, 1, 14, 988725) So far as I understand by “protection of vested rights” you had meant “protection of the existing rights”.
('36', 497, 1, 15, 988832) Would you clarify?
('36', 497, 1, 16, 988851) 8. 1 have just finished reading your Satyagraha in South Africa.
('36', 497, 1, 17, 988916) In the preface of the book while there is a mention of Rajendra Babu’s Satyagraha in Champaran there is not a word about [my] History of the South African Satyagraha.
('36', 497, 1, 18, 989083) If my work was incomprehensive or unauthentic a line from you could have stopped its sale.
('36', 497, 1, 19, 989174) And if the events described in it are authentic, then why has it been ignored?

('36', 497, 4, 22, 989307) LETTER FROM BENARSIDAS CHATURVEDI
('36', 497, 5, 23, 989341) FEROZABAD,
('36', 497, 7, 24, 989352) SIR, There are certain statements in your article “Out of the Frying pan” published in the Young India of 9th Sept.
('36', 497, 7, 25, 989468) which require explanation at your hands.
('36', 497, 7, 26, 989509) You have quoted a passage from the report of Mr. S. A. Waiz to the l.I.C. Association which asserts that there were two ‘chief reasons’ which led the Colonial Indians to leave their land of birth: (l) The desire to visit the motherland and (2) The rumour that India had obtained self government.
('36', 497, 7, 27, 989805) Now as one who has been in close touch with many of
('36', 498, 0, 1, 989857) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 499
('36', 498, 1, 2, 989902) these returned emigrants for the last six years and who has visited their quarters not less than twenty times during this period, I can say that the second reason is pure fiction.
('36', 498, 1, 3, 990082) When I was entrusted with the work of looking after these emigrants by Mr. Andrews and yourself, one or two persons brought forward the same reason before me and I made a thorough enquiry into it and found it absolutely without any foundation.
('36', 498, 1, 4, 990326) Evidently Mr. Waiz has been misled by some of the clever people in Matiaburz.
('36', 498, 1, 5, 990404) Referring to the difficulties of these returned emigrants in India you say, “Here they are social lepers, not even knowing the language of the people.” First of all I must say that most of them do know the language of the people.
('36', 498, 1, 6, 990634) Surely they can express their ideas though not in grammatically correct Hindustani, I have myself talked with hundreds of these people in Matiaburz in Hindi and during my several visits to Matiaburz I did not come across a single Indian whom your phrase “not even knowing the language of the people” could apply.
('36', 498, 1, 7, 990947) I can definitely say that most of them have fair knowledge of speaking Hindustani.
('36', 498, 1, 8, 991030) Of course they do not know literary Hindi or Urdu.
('36', 498, 1, 9, 991081) Then there is one thing more that must not be forgotten, i.e., more than eighty per cent of the returned emigrants get absorbed in the villages of India and it is only less than twenty per cent who find their way to Matiaburz, and these people in Matiaburz have been offered opportunities for settlement many a time but they have all along refused to consider them.
('36', 498, 1, 10, 991447) There can be no doubt that a good many of those who are at present stranded in Matiaburz suffered at the hands of their caste people, the zamindars and the police and the pandits, but as I have said they form only a small percentage of the total number of the returned emigrants.
('36', 498, 1, 11, 991727) Thus your statement requires qualification.
('36', 498, 2, 12, 991771) You approve the policy of sending these returned emigrants to the “most suitable colony that would receive them”.
('36', 498, 2, 13, 991885) At present only British Guiana is ready to receive them and the Government of India is willing to send some of them to that Colony.
('36', 498, 2, 14, 992017) Indeed there is a steamer waiting at Calcutta for some days past.
('36', 498, 2, 15, 992083) It sails on 20th.
('36', 498, 2, 16, 992101) Do you approve of the idea of Fiji Indians being sent to British Guiana?
('36', 498, 2, 17, 992174) I ask this question because I am afraid that the Indian Government may take advantage of this statement of yours and despatch these Fiji Indians to British Guiana.
('36', 498, 2, 18, 992338) At present the number of British Guiana returned emigrants in Matiaburz does not exceed 300, while the number of Fiji returned is more than 600. I made an enquiry in Matiaburz 10 months ago and published my conclusions in the Chand of Allahabad.
('36', 498, 2, 19, 992584) Extracts from this article of mine were read by a member of the Fiji Legislative Council in a meeting of the Council and he moved a resolution that 500 of these Fiji people should be taken to Fiji.
('36', 498, 2, 20, 992782) The resolution was passed and was taken as a unanimous expression of opinion of the elected members of the Council.
('36', 498, 2, 21, 992898) Now the Governor of Fiji has written to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on this subject.
('36', 498, 2, 22, 992995) So there is just a possibility of Fiji returned emigrants being sent back to Fiji.
('36', 498, 3, 23, 993078) You have mentioned four fundamental questions raised by this problem of stranded emigrants in Matiaburz: (I) emigration policy, (2) special case of British Guiana and Fiji, (3) scope of the friendly societies and (4) the duty of the nation.
('36', 499, 0, 1, 993319) 500 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 499, 1, 2, 993361) say that immediate relief should be given to the stranded emigrants in Calcutta.
('36', 499, 1, 3, 993442) Now so far as the question of British Guiana returned emigrants being sent to that Colony is concerned, I entirely agree with you but I will not advise the Fiji Indians to be sent to British Guiana which has a climate very much worse than that of Fiji, which possesses an ideal climate.
('36', 499, 1, 4, 993729) Indeed the four fundamental questions raised by you are inter related and they require immediate attention.
('36', 499, 1, 5, 993837) It is clear from the letter of the Government of India that they intend to recruit 500 families for British Guiana.
('36', 499, 1, 6, 993953) Besides this thousands of Indians return from the Colonies every year and there is no doubt that the Matiaburz problem is not a temporary one, it will be recurring again and again for a long time to come.
('36', 499, 1, 7, 994158) We must also remember that many of the Colonial Governments have been playing one mischief, i.e., they are sending their papers to India.
('36', 499, 1, 8, 994296) After having given the best portion of their lives to the Colonies these unfortunate people return to their motherland complete moral and physical wrecks and these will never make good Colonists.
('36', 499, 1, 9, 994492) We know a large number of these people were sent to Mauritius more than two years ago and most of them returned to India at the cost of the Mauritius Government!
('36', 499, 1, 10, 994654) In our anxiety to give these people immediate relief we must not neglect this aspect of the question, i.e., how many of them will make good Colonists.
('36', 499, 1, 11, 994805) Our duty does not finish simply in despatching these people in haste to any Colony.
('36', 499, 1, 12, 994889) The whole question requires a thorough discussion among those who are interested in it and who can do something for these people.
('36', 499, 1, 13, 995019) When we have done so and arrived at some conclusions then will come the time to require the Government to do its duty.
('36', 499, 1, 14, 995138) The discussion suggested by me will have to be preceded by a thorough enquiry about the condition of returned emigrants in the districts from which they go to Matiaburz.
('36', 499, 1, 15, 995308) Yours etc.,

('36', 499, 4, 18, 995377) GANDHIJI’S QUESTIONS TO RAJCHANDRA AND HIS REPLIES 1
('36', 499, 5, 19, 995430) 1. Q. What is the Soul?
('36', 499, 5, 20, 995454) Does it perform actions?
('36', 499, 5, 21, 995479) Do past actions impede its progress or not?
('36', 499, 6, 22, 995523) A. (1) As there are physical objects like a pot, piece of cloth, etc., so there is an entity called the atman whose essence is knowledge.
('36', 499, 6, 23, 995661) The former are impermanent.
('36', 499, 6, 24, 995689) They cannot exist through all time in the same form.
('36', 499, 6, 25, 995742) The atman is an imperishable
('36', 499, 7, 26, 995771) entity which exists eternally in the same form.
('36', 499, 7, 27, 995819) Anything which is not the product of
('36', 499, 8, 28, 995856) 1 The translation of the questions is reproduced from The letter accompanying Rajchandra’s replies is dated Bombay, Saturday, Aso Vad 6, 1950 [October 20, 1894].
('36', 500, 0, 1, 996018) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 501
('36', 500, 1, 2, 996063) a combination of other elements is imperishable.
('36', 500, 1, 3, 996112) We cannot think of the atman as
('36', 500, 2, 4, 996144) being such a product, for, no matter in how many thousand different ways we combine material substances, such combinations cannot possibly produce life and conscio usness.
('36', 500, 2, 5, 996316) Every one of us can know from experience that by combining several elements we cannot produce in the compound a property which is not present in any of those elements.
('36', 500, 2, 6, 996484) We do not find knowledge to be the essence of physical substances.
('36', 500, 2, 7, 996551) If we change the forms of such substances and combine them, or if they change and combine by chance, the products will be of the same kind as they are; that is, they will be of a material nature and will not have knowledge as their essence.
('36', 500, 2, 8, 996792) It is not possible, then, that the atman, which the seers describe as having knowledge as
('36', 500, 3, 9, 996882) its essential character, can be produced by any combination of the elements (earth, water, air, space) of which physical substances like a pot, a piece of cloth, etc., are composed.
('36', 500, 3, 10, 997064) The atman has knowledge as its essential character, whereas material
('36', 500, 4, 11, 997133) substances are characterized by its absence.
('36', 500, 4, 12, 997178) These are the eternal natures of the two.
('36', 500, 5, 13, 997220) This and a thousand other reasons prove the atman to be imperishable.
('36', 500, 5, 14, 997290) Further reflection on the subject enables us to realize that the atman from its nature is imperishable.
('36', 500, 5, 15, 997394) There is, therefore, no error or logical difficulty in believing that the atman, the existence of which is the cause of our experiencing happiness and suffering which also withdraws itself from either, and which is conscious of something which thinks and impels, is characterized by awareness as its essential nature and that, in virtue of this nature, it is an imperishable entity which exists eternally; on the contrary, belief in the atman has this merit of accepting truth.
('36', 500, 6, 16, 997872) (2) When the atman has attained a state of knowledge, the state resulting from a true understanding of its essence, it is the karta 1 of that state, the state of illumination (determination of what it truly is) and of the resulting state of pure awareness, which is its true nature.
('36', 500, 6, 17, 998155) In a state of ignorance, it is the karta of the emotions of anger, love of honour, attachment, greed, etc., and when enjoying the fruits of these emotions, becomes, as the occasion may require, the karta of physical objects like a pot, a piece of cloth etc., that is, he is not the creator of the original substance of those objects, but is only the karta of the action of imposing some form on it.
('36', 500, 6, 18, 998554) This latter state is described in Jainism as karma, and in Vedanta as illusion or in other similar terms.
('36', 500, 6, 19, 998660) If we reflect carefully on the matter, we shall clearly see that the atman cannot be the karta of physical objects or emotions like anger, that it is karta only of the state of self realization.
('36', 500, 7, 20, 998855) (3) The karmas performed while in the state of ignorance are like seed in the beginning and grow into a tree in course of time; in other words, the atman has to
('36', 500, 8, 21, 999016) suffer the consequences of those karmas.
('36', 500, 8, 22, 999057) Just as contact with fire produces the experience of heat, the natural end of which is pain, so the atman, being the karta of
('36', 500, 9, 23, 999183) emotions of anger, etc., has to suffer, as consequence, pain in the form of birth, old

('36', 501, 0, 1, 999285) 502 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 501, 1, 2, 999327) age and death.
('36', 501, 1, 3, 999342) You should carefully reflect over this idea and ask me any question which may arise in your mind about it, for an understanding of the state from which the soul must withdraw itself and the effort to withdraw will bring deliverance to it.
('36', 501, 1, 4, 999581) 2. Q. What is God?
('36', 501, 1, 5, 999600) Is He the creator of the universe?
('36', 501, 2, 6, 999635) A. (1) You, I and others are souls suffering the bondage of karma.
('36', 501, 2, 7, 999702) The soul’s existence in its natural state, that is, in freedom from karma and purely as the atman that it is, is the state of being Ishvar.
('36', 501, 2, 8, 999842) 1 That which has the aishvarya 2 of knowledge, etc., may be described as Ishvar.
('36', 501, 2, 9, 999923) This Ishvarhood is the natural state of the atman, which is not revealed when it is engaged in karmas.
('36', 501, 2, 10, 1000026) When the atman however, realizes
('36', 501, 3, 11, 1000059) that being engaged in karma is not its real nature and fixes its attention on itself, then alone do omniscience, power etc., manifest themselves in it and we can see nothing among all the objects in the universe with greater power than the atman’s.
('36', 501, 3, 12, 1000308) It is, therefore, my positive belief that Ishvar is another name for atman and does not
('36', 501, 4, 13, 1000396) signify a different Being of greater power.
('36', 501, 5, 14, 1000440) (2) Ishvar is not the creator ot the universe, that is, atoms, space, etc., can be conceived only as imperishable entities and not as created from some other substance.
('36', 501, 5, 15, 1000609) If it is stated that they came into being from Ishvar, that, too, does not seem likely; for, if we believe that Ishvar is a spirit, how can atoms, space, etc., come into being from Him?
('36', 501, 5, 16, 1000795) For it is impossible that matter can come into existence from that which is spirit.
('36', 501, 5, 17, 1000879) If Ishvar is regarded as material, He will then lose His Ishvarhood; also, a spiritual entity like the soul cannot come into being from such an Ishvar.
('36', 501, 5, 18, 1001031) If we regard Him as being both matter and spirit, that only means that we are pleased to call the world, which is both matter and spirit, by another name, Ishvar.
('36', 501, 5, 19, 1001194) Instead of doing that, it is better to call the world the world: If we hold that atoms, space, etc., are imperishable entities and that Ishvar only awards the fruits of karma, this too, cannot be proved.
('36', 501, 5, 20, 1001398) Convincing reasons have been given in support of this view in Shatdarshan Samuchchaya 3.
('36', 501, 6, 21, 1001487) 3. Q. What is moksha?
('36', 501, 7, 22, 1001509) A. While the atman is in the state of ignorance, characterized by anger, etc., it
('36', 501, 8, 23, 1001591) is under the bondage of the body, and complete cessation of such a state, deliverance from it, is described by seers as moksha.
('36', 501, 8, 24, 1001719) A little reflection shows this to be logical
('36', 501, 9, 25, 1001764) and convincing.
('36', 501, 9, 26, 1001780) 4. Q. Is it possible for a person to know for certain, while he is still living, whether or not he will attain moksha.
('36', 501, 10, 27, 1001899) A. If our arms are tied with a rope wound several times round them and if the twists of the rope are loosened one after another, we feel the loosening of each twist
('36', 501, 11, 28, 1002064) 1 Ruler, God 2 Power 3 A philosophical treatise; Rajchandra had earlier sent a copy of it to Gandhiji.
('36', 502, 0, 1, 1002167) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 503
('36', 502, 1, 2, 1002212) and in the end become conscious of the rope having been removed.
('36', 502, 1, 3, 1002277) In like manner as the innumerable bonds, the products of ignorance, which bind the atman loosen one by one, the latter becomes conscious of progressing towards moksha, and when the bonds are about to fall off, the atman shines forth with the light of its essence and
('36', 502, 2, 4, 1002544) knows beyond doubt that it is about to be delivered from the bonds of ignorance.
('36', 502, 2, 5, 1002625) While still dwelling in this body, it comes out of the state of ignorance, etc., and becomes conscious of its pure essence and of its absolute otherness and freedom from all relations.
('36', 502, 2, 6, 1002810) In other words, it is possible to experience the state of moksha even
('36', 502, 3, 7, 1002880) while living.
('36', 502, 3, 8, 1002894) 5. Q. It is said that after his death, a man may, according to his actions, be reborn as an animal, a tree or even a stone.
('36', 502, 3, 9, 1003018) Is this a fact?
('36', 502, 4, 10, 1003034) A. After the soul has left the body, it attains a state according to the merit it has earned through its actions; hence, it may be born even as a lower creature, or may have even to assume a body of earth 1 and, devoid of the other four senses suffer the fruits of its karma [through the sense of touch alone].
('36', 502, 4, 11, 1003345) This does not mean, however, that it becomes pure stone or earth.
('36', 502, 4, 12, 1003411) The soul assumes a body of stone, but, even then, it exists as soul, though its existence is not manifest to us.
('36', 502, 4, 13, 1003524) Since in that condition the other four senses are unmanifest, the soul may be described as having an earth body.
('36', 502, 4, 14, 1003637) In the course of time, the soul leaves such a body after it has enjoyed the fruits of its karmas and then the stone material exists merely as atoms and, because the soul has left it, does not possess the instinct of food, etc.
('36', 502, 4, 15, 1003864) In other words, the idea is not that stone itself, which is pure matter, becomes a soul.
('36', 502, 4, 16, 1003953) It is in order to enjoy the fruits of those karmas which, because of their hard nature, compels the soul to take on a body possessing only one sense, the sense of touch the other senses remaining unmanifest, that it is born in an earth body; it does not, however, become pure earth or stone.
('36', 502, 4, 17, 1004245) The body is like a garment to the soul, and is not its essence.
('36', 502, 5, 18, 1004309) [6. & 7.] 2 The answer to Q. 6 is contained in the reply given above as also the answer to Q. 7 which is that earth or stone as such cannot be the kartas of any karma.
('36', 502, 5, 19, 1004477) It is the soul which has entered them and lives in them that is the karta of karmas, and
('36', 502, 6, 20, 1004566) even so, the relation between the two is like milk and water.
('36', 502, 6, 21, 1004628) Just as, even when they are mixed, milk is milk and water is water, so also the soul through the binding effect of its karmas which confines it to the possession of one sense only, seems to have become stone or mere matter, but, in its essential nature, it is a soul and even in that state it possesses the instincts of hunger, fear etc., though they remain unmanifest.
('36', 502, 6, 22, 1004998) 8. Q. What is Arya Dharma?
('36', 502, 6, 23, 1005025) Do all Indian religions originate from the Vedas?
('36', 502, 7, 24, 1005075) A. (1) In defining Arya Dharma, everyone has his own religion in view.
('36', 502, 8, 25, 1005146) 1 Probably as a particle of organic matter present in the earth 2 The questions are not given in the source in Gandhiji’s words and, therefore, they are not included in the questions translated in Vol. I.
('36', 503, 0, 1, 1005351) 504 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 503, 1, 2, 1005393) Commonly a Jain describes Jainism, a Buddhist describes Buddhism and a Vedantin describes Vedanta as Arya Dharma.
('36', 503, 1, 3, 1005507) But seers describe only that Arya—noble—path as Arya Dharma which enables the soul to realize its true nature, and rightly so.
('36', 503, 1, 4, 1005634) (2) It is impossible that all religions had their origin in the Vedas.
('36', 503, 1, 5, 1005705) I know from experience that great souls like the [Jain] Tirthankars 1 have revealed knowledge of a thousand times deeper import than what the Vedas contain.
('36', 503, 1, 6, 1005862) I, therefore, believe that, since something imperfect cannot be the origin of a perfect thing, we are not justified in asserting that all religions had originated from the Vedas.
('36', 503, 1, 7, 1006041) We may believe that Vaishnavism and other sects had their origin in the Vedas.
('36', 503, 1, 8, 1006120) It seems that the latter existed before the time of the Buddha and Mahavira, the last teacher of Jainism; it also seems likely that they are really ancient works.
('36', 503, 1, 9, 1006283) But we cannot say that only that which is ancient is true or perfect, nor that what came later is necessarily untrue or imperfect.
('36', 503, 1, 10, 1006414) Apart from this, the ideas propounded in the Vedas and in Jain doctrines have existed from the beginning of time; only the outward forms changed.
('36', 503, 1, 11, 1006560) There is no totally new creation or absolute destruction.
('36', 503, 1, 12, 1006618) Since we may believe that the ideas propounded by the Vedas and in the doctrines of Jainism and other religions have existed from the beginning of time, where is the room for controversy?
('36', 503, 1, 13, 1006806) All the same, it is only right that you and I and others should reflect and consider which of these systems of ideas has more power—truth—in them.
('36', 503, 2, 14, 1006953) 9. Q. Who composed the Vedas?
('36', 503, 2, 15, 1006983) Are they anadi 2 ?
('36', 503, 2, 16, 1007002) If so, what does anadi
('36', 503, 4, 17, 1007025) A. (1) The Vedas were probably composed a long time ago.
('36', 503, 5, 18, 1007082) (2) No scripture, considered as a book, is anadi; but with respect to the ideas propounded in them, all scriptures are anadi, for there have been souls at all times
('36', 503, 6, 19, 1007247) who taught them in one form or another.
('36', 503, 6, 20, 1007287) It cannot be otherwise.
('36', 503, 6, 21, 1007311) The emotions of anger, etc., are anadi and so are those of forgiveness, etc.
('36', 503, 6, 22, 1007388) The way of violence, too, is anadi, as is the path of non violence.
('36', 503, 6, 23, 1007456) What we should consider is which of these conduce to the welfate of the soul?Both classes of things are anadi, though
('36', 503, 7, 24, 1007574) sometimes the one and sometimes the other may be predominant.
('36', 503, 7, 25, 1007636) 10. Q. Who is the author of the Gita?
('36', 503, 7, 26, 1007674) Is God its author?
('36', 503, 7, 27, 1007693) Is there any evidence
('36', 503, 8, 28, 1007715) that He is?
('36', 503, 9, 29, 1007727) A. (1) The replies given above partly answer this question; if by God we mean a person who has attained illumination—perfect illuminations—then we can say that the Gita was composed by God.
('36', 503, 9, 30, 1007917) If, however, we accept God as being all pervading, like the sky, eternally existing and passive, the Gita or any other book cannot have
('36', 503, 10, 31, 1008053) been composed by Him.
('36', 503, 10, 32, 1008075) For, writing a book is an ordinary activity undertaken at a particular point in time and is not anadi.
('36', 503, 11, 33, 1008178) 1 Self realized men whose teachings evolved into Jainism 2 Without a beginning
('36', 504, 0, 1, 1008257) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 505
('36', 504, 1, 2, 1008302) (2) The Gita is believed to be the work of Veda Vyasa and, since Lord Krishna
('36', 504, 2, 3, 1008380) had propounded this teaching to Arjuna, He is said to be its real author.
('36', 504, 2, 4, 1008454) This may be true.
('36', 504, 2, 5, 1008472) The work is indeed great.
('36', 504, 2, 6, 1008498) The ideas it propounds have been taught from time immemorial, but it is not possible that these same verses have existed from the beginning of time.
('36', 504, 2, 7, 1008647) Nor is it likely that they were composed by God Who does nothing.
('36', 504, 2, 8, 1008713) They can have been composed only by an embodied soul, who acts.
('36', 504, 2, 9, 1008777) There is no harm, therefore, in saying that a perfectly illuminated person is God, and that a Shastra taught by him is one revealed by God.
('36', 504, 2, 10, 1008917) 11. Q. Does any merit accrue from the sacrifice of animals or other things?
('36', 504, 3, 11, 1008993) A. It is always sinful to kill an animal to give it as an offering in sacrifice or injure it in any way, even if this is done for the purpose of a sacrifice or living in the very abode of God.
('36', 504, 3, 12, 1009186) The practice of giving gifts at the time of a sacrifice does earn some merit, but since this is accompanied with violence it, too, deserves no commendation.
('36', 504, 3, 13, 1009343) 12. Q. If a claim is put forward that a particular religion is the best, may we not ask the claimant for proof?
('36', 504, 4, 14, 1009455) A. If no proof is required and if any such claim is made without proof in its support, reason and unreason, dharma and adharma, everything will have to be
('36', 504, 5, 15, 1009610) accepted as “the best” .
('36', 504, 5, 16, 1009635) Only the test of proof can show what is the best and what is not.
('36', 504, 5, 17, 1009701) That religion alone is the best and is truly strong, which is most helpful in destroying the bondage of worldly life and can establish us in the state which is our essence.
('36', 504, 5, 18, 1009874) 13. Q. Do you know anything about Christianity?
('36', 504, 5, 19, 1009922) If so, what do you think of it?
('36', 504, 6, 20, 1009954) A. I know something in general about Christianity.
('36', 504, 6, 21, 1010005) Even a little study of the subject will show that no other country has gone so deep as India and discovered a religious path which can rival the one discovered by the great seers of India.
('36', 504, 6, 22, 1010194) Among the other religions, Christianity asserts the eternal subjection of the soul, even in the state of moksha.
('36', 504, 6, 23, 1010307) It does not give a true description of the anadi state of the soul, of
('36', 504, 7, 24, 1010378) the law of karma or of the cessation of karma, and I am not likely, therefore, to accept the view that it is the best religion.
('36', 504, 7, 25, 1010506) It does not seem to offer a satisfactory solution of the problems which I have mentioned.
('36', 504, 7, 26, 1010596) I am not making this statement in a sectarian spirit.
('36', 504, 7, 27, 1010650) If you wish to ask more questions on this, you may, and then it will be possible for me to resolve your doubts still further.
('36', 504, 7, 28, 1010776) 14. Q. The Christians hold that the Bible is divinely inspired and that Christ was an incarnation of God, being his son.
('36', 504, 7, 29, 1010897) Was He?
('36', 504, 8, 30, 1010905) A. This is a matter of faith and cannot be proved rationally.
('36', 504, 8, 31, 1010967) What I said above concerning the claim that the Gita and the Vedas are divinely inspired may be applied
('36', 504, 9, 32, 1011071) to the Bible too.
('36', 504, 9, 33, 1011089) It is impossible that God, who is free from birth and death will incarnate Himself as a human being; for it is the changes of attachment, aversion,
('36', 505, 0, 1, 1011237) 506 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 505, 1, 2, 1011279) etc., which are the cause of birth and it does not appeal to reason that God, who has no attachment and aversion, will take birth as a human being.
('36', 505, 1, 3, 1011427) The idea that Jesus is, and was, the son of God may perhaps be acceptable if we interpret the belief as an allegory; otherwise, tested by the canons of reason, it is difficult to accept.
('36', 505, 1, 4, 1011614) How can we say that God, Who is free, has or had a son?
('36', 505, 1, 5, 1011670) If we assert that He has or had one, what was the manner of the son’s birth?
('36', 505, 1, 6, 1011747) If we believe that both God and His son are anadi, how can we explain their being father and son?
('36', 505, 1, 7, 1011845) These and other objections
('36', 505, 2, 8, 1011872) deserve examination.
('36', 505, 2, 9, 1011893) If we reflect over them, I think the belief will not be found acceptable.
('36', 505, 2, 10, 1011967) 15. Q. Were all the Old Testament prophecies fulfilled in Christ?
('36', 505, 3, 11, 1012033) A. Even if they were, that should only make us think about the two scriptures.
('36', 505, 3, 12, 1012112) Nor is the act of the prophecies having been fulfilled a sufficiently strong reason to justify us in asserting that Jesus was an incarnation of God, for the birth of a great soul can also be predicted with the help of astrology.
('36', 505, 3, 13, 1012341) Even if, however, someone foretold the event by virtue of his knowledge, unless it is established that that person had perfect knowledge of the path to moksha, the fact of his having predicted a future event appeals only to faith as proof of a thing and we cannot believe that no reasoning on the opposite side can diminish its force.
('36', 505, 4, 14, 1012676) [16] 1 .
('36', 505, 4, 15, 1012685) A. In this question you ask about the miracles attributed to Jesus Christ.
('36', 505, 4, 16, 1012760) If it is said that he put a soul back into the body which it had left, or that he put another soul in its place, this could not possibly have been done.
('36', 505, 4, 17, 1012913) If it could be done, the law of karma would lose its meaning.
('36', 505, 4, 18, 1012975) Apart from this, mastery of yoga techniques enables a person to perform certain miracles, and if it is claimed that Jesus had such powers we cannot assert that the claim is false or impossible.
('36', 505, 4, 19, 1013169) Such yogic powers are of no consequence compared to the power of the atman; the latter is infinitely greater than the powers attained by yoga.
('36', 505, 4, 20, 1013312) You may ask more questions on this subject when we meet.
('36', 505, 4, 21, 1013369) 17. Q. Can anyone remember his past lives or have an idea of his future lives?
('36', 505, 5, 22, 1013448) A. This is quite possible.
('36', 505, 5, 23, 1013475) One whose knowledge has become pure may be able to do so.
('36', 505, 5, 24, 1013533) We can infer the possibility of rain from certain signs in the clouds: similarly, from the actions of a soul in this life, we can understand, perhaps partially, their causes in its previous existence.
('36', 505, 5, 25, 1013734) We can also judge from the nature of the actions what results they are likely to have.
('36', 505, 5, 26, 1013821) On further reflection, we can also know what kind of a future existence the soul is likely to have or what kind of a past existence it had.
('36', 505, 5, 27, 1013961) 18. Q. If yes, who can?
('36', 505, 6, 28, 1013985) A. The answer to this is contained in the reply above.
('36', 505, 6, 29, 1014040) 19. Q. You have given the names of some who have attained moksha.
('36', 505, 6, 30, 1014106) What is
('36', 505, 7, 31, 1014114) the authority for this statement?
('36', 505, 8, 32, 1014148) A. If you have addressed this question personally to me, I may say in reply that
('36', 505, 9, 33, 1014229) 1 This is omitted in the translation of the questions in.
('36', 506, 0, 1, 1014287) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 507
('36', 506, 1, 2, 1014332) one can to some extent infer from one’s own experience how a person whose involvement in earthly existence is about to end is likely to speak or act, and on the basis of this one can assert whether or not such a person attained moksha.
('36', 506, 1, 3, 1014568) In most
('36', 506, 2, 4, 1014576) cases, we can also get from Shastras reasons in support of our conclusion.
('36', 506, 2, 5, 1014651) 20. Q. What makes you say that even Buddha did not attain moksha?
('36', 506, 3, 6, 1014717) A. On the basis of the teachings of Buddhist scriptures.
('36', 506, 3, 7, 1014774) If his views were the same as these, then they seem to have been inconsistent with one another, and that is not a mark of perfect illumination.
('36', 506, 3, 8, 1014918) If a person has not attained perfect illumination his attachments and aversions are not likely to disappear so long as he is in such a state; earthly existence is a necessary consequence.
('36', 506, 3, 9, 1015106) One cannot, therefore, claim such a person to have attained absolute moksha.
('36', 506, 3, 10, 1015183) Moreover, it is impossible for you and me
('36', 506, 4, 11, 1015225) to know from independent sources that the Buddha’s views were different from those contained in the teachings attributed to him.
('36', 506, 4, 12, 1015354) Even so, if it is asserted that his views were in fact different and proof given in support of the assertion, there is no reason why we should not accept that as possible.
('36', 506, 4, 13, 1015526) 21. Q. What will finally happen to this world?
('36', 506, 5, 14, 1015573) A. It does not seem rationally possible to me that all souls will attain absolute moksha or that the world will perish completely.
('36', 506, 5, 15, 1015704) It is likely to continue to
('36', 506, 6, 16, 1015732) exist for ever in the same state as at present.
('36', 506, 6, 17, 1015780) Some aspect of it may undergo transformation and almost disappear, and another may grow; such is the nature of the world that, if there is growth in one sphere, there is decline in another.
('36', 506, 6, 18, 1015970) Having regard to this fact, and after deep reflection, it seems impossible to me that this world will perish completely.
('36', 506, 6, 19, 1016091) By “world” we do not mean this earth only.
('36', 506, 6, 20, 1016134) 22. Q. Will the world be morally better off in the future?
('36', 506, 6, 21, 1016193) A. It would not be proper to encourage any soul which loves immorality to take wrong advantage of the answer to this question.
('36', 506, 6, 22, 1016320) All modes in this world, including morality and immorality, have existed from the beginning of time.
('36', 506, 6, 23, 1016421) But it is possible for you and me to eschew immorality and accept morality, and it is the duty of the atman to do that.
('36', 506, 6, 24, 1016541) It is not possible to assert that immorality will be given up
('36', 506, 7, 25, 1016603) by all and morality will prevail, for such an extreme state cannot come about.
('36', 506, 7, 26, 1016682) 23. Q. Is there anything like total destruction of the world?
('36', 506, 8, 27, 1016744) A. If by pralaya is meant total destruction, that is not possible, for complete destruction of all that exists is impossible.
('36', 506, 8, 28, 1016870) If by pralaya is meant the merging of
('36', 506, 9, 29, 1016908) everything in God, the belief is accepted in some doctrines but that does not seem possible to me.
('36', 506, 9, 30, 1017007) For, how can all objects and all souls arrive in an identical state so that such a thing may happen?
('36', 506, 9, 31, 1017108) If they ever do, then diversity cannot develop again.
('36', 506, 9, 32, 1017162) If we accept the possibility of pralaya on the supposition of unmanifest diversity in
('36', 506, 10, 33, 1017248) the souls and manifest sameness, how can diversity exist except through connection with a body?
('36', 506, 10, 34, 1017344) If we believe that such connection exists [in the state of pralaya], we
('36', 506, 11, 35, 1017416) shall have to believe further that all souls will have one sense only and in doing so
('36', 507, 0, 1, 1017502) 508 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('36', 507, 1, 2, 1017544) we shall reject, without reason, the possibility of other modes of existence.
('36', 507, 1, 3, 1017622) In other words, we shall have to suppose that a soul which had attained a higher state and was about to be free for ever from the contingency of existence with one sense only had none the less to be in such a state.
('36', 507, 1, 4, 1017838) This and many similar doubts arise.
('36', 507, 1, 5, 1017874) A pralaya
('36', 507, 2, 6, 1017884) involving all souls is impossible.
('36', 507, 2, 7, 1017919) 24. Q. Can an illiterate person attain moksha through bhakti alone?
('36', 507, 3, 8, 1017987) A. Bhakti is a cause of knowledge and knowledge of moksha.
('36', 507, 3, 9, 1018046) If by an illit 
('36', 507, 4, 10, 1018062) erate person we mean one without knowledge of letters, it is not impossible that he may cultivate bhakti.
('36', 507, 4, 11, 1018168) Every soul has knowledge as its essence.
('36', 507, 4, 12, 1018209) The power of bhakti purifies knowledge, and pure knowledge becomes the cause of moksha.
('36', 507, 4, 13, 1018297) I do not believe that, without the manifestation of perfect knowledge, absolute moksha is
('36', 507, 5, 14, 1018387) possible.
('36', 507, 5, 15, 1018397) Nor need I point out that knowledge of letters is contained in perfect [spiritual] knowledge.
('36', 507, 5, 16, 1018491) It cannot be true that knowledge of letters is a cause of moksha
('36', 507, 6, 17, 1018556) and that, without it, self realization is not possible.
('36', 507, 6, 18, 1018612) 25. Q. Rama and Krishna are described as incarnations of God.
('36', 507, 6, 19, 1018674) What does that mean?
('36', 507, 6, 20, 1018695) Were they God Himself or only a part of Him?
('36', 507, 6, 21, 1018740) Can we attain salvation through faith in them?
('36', 507, 7, 22, 1018787) A. (1) I, too, am convinced that both were souls of great holiness.
('36', 507, 7, 23, 1018855) Each of them, being an atman, was God, If it is a fact that all the coverings over their atman had fallen off, there need be no dispute about their having attained absolute moksha.
('36', 507, 8, 24, 1019036) do not think that any soul can be a portion of God, for I can think of a thousand reasons against such a belief.
('36', 507, 8, 25, 1019149) If we believe a soul to be a portion of God, the belief in bondage and moksha will have no meaning.
('36', 507, 8, 26, 1019249) For then God Himself will be the cause of
('36', 507, 9, 27, 1019291) ignorance, etc., and if that is true, He ceases to be God.
('36', 507, 9, 28, 1019350) In other words, in being regarded as Lord of the soul God actually loses something from His status.
('36', 507, 9, 29, 1019450) Moreover, if we believe that the soul is a portion of God, what motive will a person have to strive for anything?
('36', 507, 9, 30, 1019564) For in that case the soul cannot be regarded as the karta of any
('36', 507, 10, 31, 1019629) In view of this and other objections, I am not prepared to believe any soul to be a portion of God; how, then, can I believe that such was the case with great and holy souls like Rama and Krishna?
('36', 507, 10, 32, 1019826) There is no error in believing that these two were unmanifest God, but it is doubtful whether perfect Godhood had become manifest in them.
('36', 507, 10, 33, 1019965) (2) The question whether we can attain moksha through faith in them can be easily answered.
('36', 507, 10, 34, 1020057) Moksha means absence of or deliverance from all forms of
('36', 507, 11, 35, 1020114) attachment, ignorance, etc.
('36', 507, 11, 36, 1020142) It can be attained when we cultivate faith in a person whose teaching will enable us to win such freedom from attachment and ignorance, and, reflecting on our true essence, come to have the same faith in our atman that we
('36', 507, 12, 37, 1020364) have in the teacher and identify ourselves with his personality.
('36', 507, 12, 38, 1020429) Worship of any kind other than this cannot win absolute moksha.
('36', 507, 12, 39, 1020493) It may help one to win the means of moksha, but even that cannot be asserted with certainty.
('36', 508, 0, 1, 1020586) VOL. 36 : 8 JULY, 1926 10 NOVEMBER, 1926 509
('36', 508, 1, 2, 1020631) 26. Q. Who were Brahma, Vishnu and Siva?
('36', 508, 2, 3, 1020672) A. If people believed in three gunas 1 as the cause of creation and personified
('36', 508, 3, 4, 1020752) them [as Brahma, Vishnu and Siva], this or similar explanations may make the belief
('36', 508, 4, 5, 1020836) plausible.
('36', 508, 4, 6, 1020847) But I am not particularly disposed to believe that they are what the Puranas describe them to be, for some of the descriptions appear to be allegories
('36', 508, 5, 7, 1020998) intended for religious instruction.
('36', 508, 5, 8, 1021034) Even so, I think it would be better that we, too, try
('36', 508, 6, 9, 1021088) to profit from the instruction they contain rather than attempt in vain to ascertain the
('36', 508, 7, 10, 1021177) principles embodied in the personification of Brahma, and so on.
('36', 508, 8, 11, 1021242) 27. Q. If a snake is about to bite me, should I allow myself to be bitten or
('36', 508, 9, 12, 1021319) should I kill it, supposing that that is the only way in which I can save myself?
('36', 508, 10, 13, 1021401) A. One hesitates to advise you that you should let the snake bite you.
('36', 508, 11, 14, 1021472) Nevertheless, how can it be right for you, if you have realized that the body is
('36', 508, 12, 15, 1021553) perishable, to kill, for protecting a body which has no real value to you, a creature
('36', 508, 13, 16, 1021639) which clings to it with love?
('36', 508, 13, 17, 1021669) For anyone who desires his spiritual welfare, the best
('36', 508, 14, 18, 1021724) course is to let his body perish in such circumstances.
('36', 508, 14, 19, 1021780) But how should a person who
