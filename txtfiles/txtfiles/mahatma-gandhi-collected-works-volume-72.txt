('72', 0, 1, 2, 43) 1. SPEECH AT WORKING COMMITTEE MEETING, WARDHA July 6, 1937
('72', 0, 2, 3, 103) It is stated that at the outset Mahatmaji referred to the misgivings entertained by a not inconsiderable section of the Congressmen that his other Press statements issued prior to that in connection with the constitutional deadlock had, in effect, tended to whittle down the stand so far taken by the Congress.
('72', 0, 2, 4, 414) By a thorough analysis of his several statements Mahatmaji was able to satisfy the members of the Committee that they were simply meant to clarify the Congress position, which was being constantly misunderstood and misinterpreted by high officials here and in England.
('72', 0, 3, 5, 683) Mahatmaji then explained to the Committee the alternative course of action open to them in the circumstances confronting the Congress at present.
('72', 0, 3, 6, 829) It is understood Gandhiji made no secret of the fact that he had not found in Lord Linlithgow's message 1 the assurance which he had in mind when he inserted the assurance clause 2 in the A.I.C.C. resolution at Delhi.
('72', 0, 3, 7, 1047) With the Governor's special powers of interference thus left intact, Gandhiji apprehended that frictions were very likely to occur, sooner rather than later, as it would prove difficult to prevent the overlapping of the sphere of the Governor's special powers and the normal field of activities of Ministers.
('72', 0, 3, 8, 1356) Accordingly, the fear was expressed that, despite the wishes sincerely expressed by Lord Zetland and Lord Linlithgow, the new Constitution might not in actual practice be worked for long by the Congress Ministers in furtherance of the Congress objective.
('72', 0, 4, 9, 1611) Without committing himself to any definite opinion Mahatmaji is stated to have admitted that there was some force in the argument of those who maintained that the Congress should utilize the office of ministerships in the six majority Provinces with a view to generating strength in the masses of the country so that, when the final breakdown of the Constitution came–as it was bound to come–this newly developed mass strength and enthusiasm may be harnessed to good account, should the Congress find it necessary to launch upon any mass movement in the future.
('72', 0, 5, 10, 2173) In conclusion, Gandhiji is reported to have expressed himself as being in complete agreement with Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru's opinion that there must be no lowering of the Congress flag whether the Congress representatives are in office or out of it.

('72', 1, 1, 2, 2568) 2. CONGRESS WORKING COMMITTEE RESOLUTION 1
('72', 1, 2, 3, 2611) WARDHA, July 7. 1937 The All India Congress Committee, at its meeting held in Delhi on March 18 2 1937, passed a resolution affirming the basic Congress policy in regard to the new constitution and laying down the programme to be followed inside and outside the Legislatures by Congress members of such Legislatures.
('72', 1, 2, 4, 2928) It further directed that in pursuance of that policy permission should be given for congressmen to accept office in provinces where the Congress commanded a majority in the Legislature, and the leader of the Congress Party was satisfied and could state publicly that the Governor would not use his special powers of interference or set aside the advice of Ministers in regard to their constitutional activities.
('72', 1, 2, 5, 3340) In accordance with these directions, the leaders of Congress party who were invited by Governors to form ministries, asked for the necessary assurances.
('72', 1, 2, 6, 3493) These not having been given, the leaders expressed their inability to undertake the formation of Ministries.
('72', 1, 2, 7, 3602) But since the meeting of the Working Committee on April 28 last, Lord Zetland, Lord Stanley and Viceroy have made declarations 3 on this issue on behalf of the British Government.
('72', 1, 2, 8, 3782) The Working Committee has carefully considered these declarations and is of opinion that though they exhibit a desire to make an approach to the Congress demand they fall short of the assurances demanded in terms of the A.I.C.C. resolution as interpreted by the Working Committee resolution 4 of April 28. Again the Working Committee is unable to subscribe to the doctrine or partnership propounded in some ot the aforesaid declarations.
('72', 1, 2, 9, 4220) The proper description of the existing relationship between the British Government and the people of India is that of the exploiter and the exploited, and hence they have a different outlook upon almost everything of vital importance.
('72', 1, 2, 10, 4455) The Committee feels however that the situation created as the result of the circumstances and events that have

('72', 2, 1, 2, 4946) since occured, warrants the belief that it will not be easy for the Governors to use their special powers.
('72', 2, 1, 3, 5053) The Committee has moreover considered the views of Congress members of the Legislatures and of Congressmen generally.
('72', 2, 1, 4, 5171) The Committee has therefore come to the conclusion and resolves that Congressmen be permitted to accept office where they may be invited thereto.
('72', 2, 1, 5, 5317) But it desires to make it clear that office is to be accepted and utilized for the purpose of working in accordance with lines laid down in the Congress election manifesto and to further in every possible way the Congress policy of combating the new Act on the one hand and of prosecuting the constructive programme on the other.
('72', 2, 1, 6, 5647) The Working Committee is confident that it has the support and backing of the A.I.C.C. in this decision and that this resolution is in furtherance of the general policy laid down by the Congress and the A.I.C.C. The Committee would have welcomed the opportunity of taking the direction of the A.I.C.C. in this matter but it is of opinion that delay in taking a decision at this stage would be injurious to the country's interests and would create confusion in the public mind at a time when prompt and decisive action is necessary.

('72', 3, 1, 2, 6587) 4. SPEECH AT RASHTRABHASHA ADHYAPAN MANDIR, WARDHA 1
('72', 3, 2, 3, 6640) July 7, 1937 Rajendra Babu has lightened my task by saying that the pracharaks should be men of character.
('72', 3, 2, 4, 6747) It goes without saying that those who have not the literary qualifications would not do, but it is necessary to bear in mind that even literary qualifications would be of no use where the essential qualification of character was wanting.
('72', 3, 2, 5, 6985) They will have to master the Hindi language as defined by Indore Sahitya Sammelan, i.e., the language spoken by the Hindus and Mussalmans of North India and written in Devanagari or Persian script.
('72', 3, 2, 6, 7183) Mastery of this language will mean mastery not only of the easy Hindi Hindustani spoken by the masses but also of the high flown Hindi full of Sanskrit words and the high flown Urdu full of Persian and Arabic words.
('72', 3, 2, 7, 7399) Without a knowledge of these, mastery of the language would be incomplete even as one could not claim to be master of the English language without a knowledge of the English of Chaucer, Swift and Johnson, or mastery of the Sanskrit language without a knowledge of the Sanskrit of Valmiki and Kalidas.
('72', 3, 2, 8, 7700) But I should be prepared to put up with their ignorance of Devanagari or Persian scripts, or ignorance of Hindi grammar, but I should not tolerate for a moment lack of character.
('72', 3, 2, 9, 7879) We do not need such men here and, if there is anyone among the candidates who is not likely to stand the test, let him leave betimes.
('72', 3, 2, 10, 8013) The work they are called to is no easy thing.
('72', 3, 2, 11, 8059) There is a strong body of English knowing people who say that English alone can be the lingua franca of India.
('72', 3, 2, 12, 8170) There are the pundits of Benares and Allahabad and the alims of Delhi and Lucknow who want a Sanskritized Hindi and Persianized Urdu.
('72', 3, 2, 13, 8304) The third group we have to contend against is that which has raised the cry of ‘provincial languages in danger’.
('72', 3, 2, 14, 8417) Mere learning cannot successfully grapple with these forces.
('72', 3, 2, 15, 8478) It is the work not of learned men, but of fakirs men of incorruptible character and with no axe to grind.
('72', 3, 2, 16, 8584) If you are found wanting in this respect and the people amongst whom you are working were to lay

('72', 4, 1, 2, 8887) rough hands on you, I should not blame them.
('72', 4, 1, 3, 8932) They are not pledged to ahimsa.
('72', 4, 1, 4, 8964) Nor is money going to help us much.
('72', 4, 1, 5, 9000) You know, I agreed to preside over the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan at Indore in 1935 on condition that the Reception Committee should collect Rs. 1,00,000 for Hindi prachar in South India in particular and other non Hindi Provinces in general.
('72', 4, 1, 6, 9239) I was loath to accept the invitation, but Jamnalalji stood surety for the Reception Committee.
('72', 4, 1, 7, 9334) The Committee failed to collect the amount, in fact it collected then practically nothing at all.
('72', 4, 1, 8, 9432) But in the year following about Rs. 22,000 were collected.
('72', 4, 1, 9, 9491) Jamnalalji has now contributed Rs. 25,000 from his own pocket, and he has secured a promise of Rs. 75,000 from the charities of the late Kamalapatji of Kanpur.
('72', 4, 1, 10, 9651) There is thus no lack of money.
('72', 4, 1, 11, 9683) But what can money do?
('72', 4, 1, 12, 9706) Wardha was just a cotton centre with a few ginning factories.
('72', 4, 1, 13, 9768) It is Jamnalalji’s ambiton to turn it into a cultural centre and a centre of national activities.
('72', 4, 1, 14, 9866) He has, therefore, helped in bringing into being Mahila Ashram, a high school, Hindi Prachar Samiti, the present training school, the weaving school, the Village Workers’ Training School, a tannery and so on.
('72', 4, 1, 15, 10075) But more than these institutions, more than money, we want character.
('72', 4, 1, 16, 10145) That is what I have come this morning to ask you to contribute to this work.

('72', 4, 6, 22, 10411) of the inauguration of the new policy of trying office?
('72', 4, 7, 23, 10467) G. The Congress Working Committee’s resolution is comprehensive.
('72', 4, 7, 24, 10532) It contains the message and programme to be followed by the Congressmen and the country.
('72', 4, 8, 25, 10621) Asked how he, the author of the demand for assurance, reconciled the stand taken in Delhi with the decision reached yesterday, Gandhiji again said: The resolution has dealt with it.
('72', 4, 8, 26, 10803) I have nothing to add to it.
('72', 4, 9, 27, 10832) 1 The correspondent had reported that he met Gandhiji “early in the morning, at 5.30, half way down from Segaon to Wardha.”
('72', 5, 0, 1, 10956) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 6
('72', 5, 1, 2, 10996) When I drew his attention to the fact that he was completing his year of seclusion in the village, Gandhiji said: Segaon has an irresistible attraction for me and I feel inclined to stay there indefinitely.
('72', 5, 2, 3, 11203) I referred to the European situation, the armament race and the war menace and asked whether he, the apostle of non violence, would not come out of his retirement in the village and spread the message of non violence over the world and thus do a service to humanity.
('72', 5, 2, 4, 11470) It is all so soothing to hear but I am not big enough for that task.
('72', 5, 2, 5, 11539) You are taking me beyond my depth.
('72', 5, 3, 6, 11574) The rest of the walk was devoted to talk about fast walking.
('72', 5, 3, 7, 11635) Gandhiji remarked on the ease and facility with which the everage villagers covered the long distances in fair weather or foul.

('72', 5, 4, 9, 11783) 6. MEANING OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL OATH
('72', 5, 5, 10, 11821) Shri Kishorelal Mashruwala writes:
('72', 5, 6, 11, 11856) I am afraid that Gandhiji's position 1 with regard to the constitutional oath has not been properly understood.
('72', 5, 6, 12, 11968) of course, one ought not to make a distinction between a legal oath and a moral oath.
('72', 5, 6, 13, 12054) But there can be a distinction between a legal oath and a religious oath.
('72', 5, 6, 14, 12128) By the latter, Gandhiji appears to mean an oath taken in the name of God and framed by [the taker] himself or by his religious teachers or scriptures.
('72', 5, 6, 15, 12279) If it is framed by himself, he knows the exact implications of that oath, and he is bound by his own interpretation of it only, and not of anyone else.
('72', 5, 6, 16, 12431) Whether he has fulfilled it or not is a question between himself and his conscience or God.
('72', 5, 6, 17, 12523) If it has been framed by his religious teachers or scriptures, he is expected to have accepted their interpretation of its implications and is fully discharged if they exonerate him.
('72', 5, 6, 18, 12706) If a person who does not accept those teachers or scriptures avers on a mere reading of the language of the oath that the oath has been broken, his opinion does not count.
('72', 5, 7, 19, 12878) A legal oath is one which is framed not by himself but by the Legislature to which he is, de facto, subject.
('72', 5, 7, 20, 12987) The exact implication of that oath is no more than what the Legislature has decided to give it.
('72', 5, 7, 21, 13083) In case of doubt as to its exact meaning, the proper authorities to adjudicate upon the meaning are the Legislature itself, the Court of Law having jurisdiction in
('72', 5, 8, 22, 13247) 1Vide “Are There Different Oaths”,26 6 1937
('72', 6, 0, 1, 13291) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY, 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 7
('72', 6, 1, 2, 13334) the matter, and subject to appeal to them eminent lawyers.
('72', 6, 1, 3, 13393) A person who perfectly fulfils the oath in the light of such interpretation is discharged not only legally but also morally.
('72', 6, 2, 4, 13518) A good deal of confusion seems to have arisen by importing into the oath of allegiance implications assigned to it not by the framers or their authorized interpreters but by the layman.
('72', 6, 2, 5, 13704) Perhaps the layman's interpretation is not without its history.
('72', 6, 2, 6, 13768) Nevertheless it cannot be accepted as authoritative.
('72', 6, 2, 7, 13821) The layman's meaning of the oath of allegiance appears to be an attitude of devotional attachment to the person of the King to such a high pitch that the pledger would be willing to die for him.
('72', 6, 2, 8, 14016) He seems also to hold that the oath once taken becomes binding upon him for life.
('72', 6, 2, 9, 14098) According to eminent constitutional lawyers, I am given to understand, both these assumptions are wrong.
('72', 6, 2, 10, 14203) According to them the oath simply means that as long as the pledger is subject to the oath (i.e., is a member of the institution which has framed the oath), he shall not rise in arms against the King, or be a party to his death, except through constitutional process.
('72', 6, 2, 11, 14471) Through constitutional process, even that is allowable.
('72', 6, 2, 12, 14527) Through constitutional process, it is open to the proper Legislagure to amend or repeal the oath altogether; it is possible to dethrone the King and even to order his execution.
('72', 6, 2, 13, 14705) But if the Legislature does not agree to it, no legislator who has taken the oath can resort to violence against the King, except after ceasing to be a member of that body.
('72', 6, 3, 14, 14878) A person pledged to Truth and Non violence (as a member of the Gandhi Seva Sangh) is assumed not to harbour any violent intention to the King under any circumstances.
('72', 6, 3, 15, 15045) There is, therefore, no moral difficulty in his case to take the oath of allegiance as interpreted above.
('72', 6, 3, 16, 15151) There is nothing to prevent him from aiming at complete independence, if he means to achieve it– as long as he is in the Legislature–through constitutional means and, in case he means to resort to other means, to do so after resigning his seat.
('72', 6, 3, 17, 15396) His oath is not intended to bind him to it when he ceases to be a member.
('72', 6, 3, 18, 15470) There is nothing again, according to lawyers, requiring a member not to harbour intentions of bringing about a constitutional revolution, even violent, if the Legislature will agree.
('72', 6, 3, 19, 15653) These means are not open to the members of the Sangh, not because they are members of the Legislature but because of their membership of the Sangh.
('72', 6, 3, 20, 15801) Thus there is no conflict between the legal and the moral aspect as assumed.
('72', 6, 3, 21, 15878) I heartily endorse this presentation of my meaning of the distinction drawn by me between legal and religious oaths.
('72', 6, 3, 22, 15995) But a friend who saw the foregoing note is not yet satisfied.
('72', 6, 3, 23, 16057) He says,
('72', 7, 0, 1, 16066) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 8
('72', 7, 1, 2, 16106) whatever be the meaning the authors of an oath may give to it, the taker of it should be the final judge of its meaning, and must therefore be at liberty to take or not to take the oath.
('72', 7, 1, 3, 16293) Whilst he is at liberty to do what he likes, the arbitrary meaning he may give contrary to the meaning given to it by its very author will be held utterly indefensible.

('72', 7, 3, 5, 16481) 7. INSTRUCTIVE FIGURES
('72', 7, 4, 6, 16504) In the course of a conversation with Dr. Syed Mahmud I happened to mention that the All India Spinners’ Association had on its register a large number of Muslim spinners, weavers and carders.
('72', 7, 4, 7, 16696) I was speaking from a general knowledge of the working of the Association.
('72', 7, 4, 8, 16771) This was a few months ago.
('72', 7, 4, 9, 16798) But as there never was any intention to keep a communal register or even to find out the caste or religion of those engaged in the different processes regarding manufacutre of khadi, figures took some time to prepare.
('72', 7, 4, 10, 17016) The actual figures generaly correspond to the impression I gave to Dr. Mahmud.
('72', 7, 4, 11, 17095) They will be found published on p.
('72', 7, 4, 12, 17130) 171 in this issue.
('72', 7, 5, 13, 17149) This is what I call living contact with the masses irrespective of caste or creed.
('72', 7, 5, 14, 17232) If the workers are true to their salt, the contact must be of an abiding nature.
('72', 7, 5, 15, 17313) It should result also in an indissoluble bond between Hindus and Mussalmans of the villages of India.
('72', 7, 5, 16, 17415) Hitherto they have not worked knowingly and voluntarily under the aegis of one agency and for a common purpose.
('72', 7, 5, 17, 17527) There is every possibility of a conscious union of hearts between them being achieved.
('72', 7, 5, 18, 17614) It should be much easier under the new scheme in which the interest of the artisans is held to be predominant.
('72', 7, 5, 19, 17725) Since the new orientation the contact has become far more real than it ever was.
('72', 7, 5, 20, 17806) For the spinners–and they are by far the largest majority among the artisans served by the Associations–are regularly instructed.
('72', 7, 5, 21, 17936) Every individual spinner receives personal attention and is taught to use better tools in a better manner.
('72', 7, 5, 22, 18043) Their wages are in many cases trebled, even quadrupled.
('72', 7, 5, 23, 18099) It is difficult to forecast the result of this new scheme, both to the individual workers and the nation at large.
('72', 7, 5, 24, 18214) One result is obvious.
('72', 7, 5, 25, 18237) These artisans have ceased to be the exploited class.
('72', 7, 5, 26, 18291) Presently they will be conscious controllers of the A.I.S.A. as they are today its prime, though unconscious, shareholders.

('72', 8, 8, 20, 19295) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL, I had long chats with Maulana Saheb yesterday.
('72', 8, 8, 21, 19362) If he is to be consulted in the choice of Muslim Ministers in the Provinces, I think it is better to make the public announcement to the effect.
('72', 8, 8, 22, 19507) The Maulana agrees.
('72', 8, 8, 23, 19527) If you think that the Working Committee should be consulted, I would suggest consultation by wire.
('72', 8, 8, 24, 19626) I expect you will write on the Hindi Urdu topic at an early date.

('72', 9, 9, 27, 21487) Art, like other creative activities, is a very jealous mistress and must be pursued with genuine, disinterested devotion.

('72', 15, 12, 34, 30361) DEAR DR.
('72', 15, 12, 35, 30370) HARDIKER, My own opinion is that now that there will be a Congress Ministry in the Bombay Presidency it may be well not to publish

('72', 16, 6, 9, 30859) July 13, 1937
('72', 16, 7, 10, 30873) GANGABEHN, I got your letter.
('72', 16, 7, 11, 30903) I was only joking regarding Vasumati.
('72', 16, 7, 12, 30941) I had asked her, "Why did you run away?" But I couldn't spare the time to force her to reply.
('72', 16, 7, 13, 31035) I could gather from her letters that your temperaments didn't agree.
('72', 16, 7, 14, 31104) If I had asked her more, she would have given details.
('72', 16, 7, 15, 31159) But why should I do that?
('72', 16, 7, 16, 31185) After asking her, I would have had to write to you.
('72', 16, 7, 17, 31237) All of us have lived together for quite a long time.
('72', 16, 7, 18, 31290) Nobody has lost anything.
('72', 16, 7, 19, 31316) Everybody gave his or her best to the others.
('72', 16, 7, 20, 31362) I, therefore, blame nobody for Vasumati's leaving Bochasan.
('72', 16, 7, 21, 31422) Everybody can overcome his or her nature only up to a certain limit.
('72', 16, 7, 22, 31491) That is why at one place the Gita says, "Practise self control," but elsewhere it says.
('72', 16, 7, 23, 31579) "What will self control avail?" Rubber also can be stretched only up to a certain point.
('72', 16, 7, 24, 31668) If stretched further, it will snap.
('72', 16, 7, 25, 31704) Let all of us, therefore, practise self control according to our capacity and keep advancing.
('72', 16, 7, 26, 31798) Kusum is fine.
('72', 16, 7, 27, 31813) Let me know when something about Manju's 2 [marriage] is settled.

('72', 17, 3, 4, 32296) NARANDAS,
('72', 17, 4, 5, 32306) Kanu has reached here safely.
('72', 17, 4, 6, 32336) I feel as if he had never left.
('72', 17, 5, 7, 32368) me your impression of him.
('72', 17, 6, 8, 32395) I will have to study the letters regarding Chimanlal again.
('72', 17, 7, 9, 32455) are lying with me.
('72', 17, 7, 10, 32474) But I get no time whatever to take them up.
('72', 17, 7, 11, 32518) There is no hurry of course.
('72', 17, 8, 12, 32547) Read the letter to Chhaganlal and pass it on to him.
('72', 17, 8, 13, 32600) If you can
('72', 17, 9, 14, 32611) detain him, certainly do so.
('72', 17, 9, 15, 32640) I will of course like it.
('72', 17, 10, 16, 32666) It is a good thing that you are giving training to the teachers in
('72', 17, 11, 17, 32733) Harijan schools.
('72', 17, 11, 18, 32750) I hope you know that there is a difference between teaching a subject as a science and teaching it as a trade.
('72', 17, 11, 19, 32861) To teachers it should be taught only as science.
('72', 17, 12, 20, 32910) Vijaya's daughter1 must be fine.
('72', 17, 12, 21, 32943) The State should of course have no right to inspect a private
('72', 17, 13, 22, 33005) school.
('72', 17, 13, 23, 33013) But under despotism where is the question of having or not having a right?
('72', 17, 13, 24, 33088) If, therefore, any officer comes for inspection, show him everything.
('72', 17, 13, 25, 33158) But ascertain on what authority he comes.
('72', 17, 13, 26, 33200) We don't wish to make an issue of the thing just now.
('72', 17, 13, 27, 33254) Keep me informed.
('72', 17, 13, 28, 33272) If possible, register your protest.
('72', 17, 14, 29, 33308) I see no objection to the use of the numeral 68. If anybody's
('72', 17, 15, 30, 33370) birthday deserves to be celebrated, use of the number of his years is natural.
('72', 17, 15, 31, 33449) Will I be completing the 68th year on Bhadarva Vad 12 and entering the 69th, or completing the 67th and entering the 68th?
('72', 17, 15, 32, 33572) I get confused.
('72', 17, 16, 33, 33588) It has started raining her e in right earnest.
('72', 17, 16, 34, 33635) The sky has not

('72', 18, 3, 11, 34324) You should bring with you a thali, a lota, two bowls, a tumbler, a spoon, a knife, a mattress, a durrie, a pillow, a blanket, an umbrella and a lantern.
('72', 18, 3, 12, 34477) You will certainly have an hour every day for pursuit of literature.

('72', 19, 3, 4, 35135) MY DEAR REBEL, I return Dagmers' letter.
('72', 19, 3, 5, 35176) I do not think the rice eating parts of India suffer because they eat rice but because they are too poor to add to the staple what those in the North do.
('72', 19, 3, 6, 35330) Whether they were better off hundreds of years [ago] is a certainty, if we grant that they had greater facilities for buying the necessary articles than now.
('72', 19, 3, 7, 35488) But as there were no statistics kept in the old days, our conclusions will be based on more or less guess.
('72', 19, 3, 8, 35595) Shriman will be an ideal husband for her 1 .
('72', 19, 3, 9, 35640) She is herself perfectly delighted with the choice.
('72', 19, 3, 10, 35692) Every time you notice solvenliness or irregularities about our institutions, you should bring these things to the notice of the responsible men.
('72', 19, 3, 11, 35837) Then only will you be able to cope with the national evil.
('72', 19, 3, 12, 35896) You should give your impressions and views about Khadi Bhandars to Shankerlal Banker, Ahmedabad, and tell him, too, of your plans for the Simla Bhandar in particular, i.e., if you have the leisure.
('72', 19, 3, 13, 36094) The leisure you can have, if you give up what is less useful, if not useless.
('72', 19, 3, 14, 36172) If I were you, I would not worry over Muslim co operation in the Hindi work.

('72', 20, 3, 5, 36605) He was the most energetic complainant.
('72', 20, 3, 6, 36644) Jhaverbhai backs him.
('72', 20, 3, 7, 36666) Chhotalal considers Rao to be an utter misfit.
('72', 20, 3, 8, 36713) Fischer considers him to be a thorough discredit.
('72', 20, 3, 9, 36763) As you know, I was prepossessed in his favour.
('72', 20, 3, 10, 36810) But I can't disregard the strong statements that all these workers make.
('72', 20, 3, 11, 36883) Parnerkar has no opinion about his ability.
('72', 20, 3, 12, 36927) His good report in Andhra is about his athletics and nothing else so far as I know.
('72', 20, 3, 13, 37011) I have just seen Pandit Harihar Sharma, and he tells me that he was working some years ago under him as Hindi pracharak and he had to be dismissed for inattention to duty and even dishonesty.
('72', 20, 3, 14, 37203) He tells me he is energetic when he wants to be but he can't be constant.
('72', 20, 3, 15, 37277) However, all these things are to serve as a warning.
('72', 20, 4, 16, 37330) I hope your sister is now free from fever.

('72', 20, 9, 21, 37477) MY DEAR NARIMAN, I have just seen your latest statement.
('72', 20, 9, 22, 37534) It surprises and pains me.
('72', 20, 9, 23, 37561) I do not know who advised you to drop the inquiry.
('72', 20, 9, 24, 37612) What you dropped was inquiry by the Working Committee because in your own language you thought it could not deal impartially with a matter which involved its own members.
('72', 20, 9, 25, 37783) I therefore told you, I had the Sardar's assurance that you could have an impartial inquiry even without any reference to the Working Committee because your complaint was not against the committee as such but against its particular member.
('72', 20, 9, 26, 38023) If the member consented, the Committee could not object to the inquiry.
('72', 20, 9, 27, 38095) Now you

('72', 21, 1, 3, 38245) Do you not see the discrepancy?
('72', 21, 1, 4, 38277) Then, again, you seem to resent the Sardar's statement 1. As it happens he issued it on my strong advice.
('72', 21, 1, 5, 38383) I thought that it was due to the public and due to you also for that matter.
('72', 21, 1, 6, 38460) He is now pinned to emphatic statements.
('72', 21, 1, 7, 38501) If you dispute them and you have evidence, it is plain sailing for you.
('72', 21, 1, 8, 38573) Indeed, you left on me the impression that when you took the Sardar for a drive, you did seek his help.
('72', 21, 1, 9, 38677) And, if I am rightly informed, you sought the help of others also.
('72', 21, 1, 10, 38744) What was wrong in it if you did?
('72', 21, 1, 11, 38777) In your first statement in reply to the Sardar's you have almost made the admission.
('72', 21, 1, 12, 38862) Nevertheless if you accuse the Sardar of lying, naturally, it is up to you to prove your case.
('72', 21, 1, 13, 38957) Remember, you are the accuser or the plaintiff.
('72', 21, 1, 14, 39005) Therefore, draw up your complaint or plaint carefully and let me have the name or names of the tribunal.
('72', 21, 1, 15, 39110) I would strongly advise you not to rush to the Press.
('72', 21, 1, 16, 39164) Let an agreed tribunal to decide on an agreed reference be appointed and a brief statement to the Press might be made afterwards.

('72', 21, 6, 24, 39618) I still believe that we stand to gain by your step.
('72', 21, 6, 25, 39670) You probably remember that I had given the same caution to Jawaharlal.
('72', 21, 6, 26, 39741) 2 And I myself had put the burden of issuing a notice on him.
('72', 21, 6, 27, 39803) If I throw out a suggestion which finds no echo in your heart, you must not act on it.

('72', 23, 6, 18, 41984) But this I write to tell you that I have begun to write on the function of Congress Ministries and allied topics 3. I hesitated but I saw that it was my duty to write, when I felt so keenly.
('72', 23, 6, 19, 42175) I wish I could send you an advance copy of my article for Harijan.
('72', 23, 6, 20, 42242) Mahadev will see this.
('72', 23, 6, 21, 42265) If he has a copy he will send it.
('72', 23, 6, 22, 42299) When you see it, you will please tell me if I may continue to write so.
('72', 23, 6, 23, 42371) I do not want to interfere with your handling of the whole situation.
('72', 23, 6, 24, 42441) For, I want the maximum from you for the country.
('72', 23, 6, 25, 42491) I would be doing distinct harm, if my writing disturbed you.
('72', 23, 6, 26, 42552) I hope you got my letter 4 about the Maulana.

('72', 24, 2, 3, 43235) July 15, 1937
('72', 24, 3, 4, 43249) MY DEAR NARIMAN, You have sent me an extraordinary letter 1. Either you are in a state of confusion, or your friends are.
('72', 24, 3, 5, 43371) So far as I can recollect, you accepted the Working Committee's decision as final regarding the telegram.
('72', 24, 3, 6, 43477) As to your other charges you had no evidence then in your possession.
('72', 24, 3, 7, 43547) Your letters showed no evidence and therefore the Working Committee could neither decide for itself except to decide against you nor could give you a committee.
('72', 24, 3, 8, 43708) How can you say you closed the matter though in your letter you reserved to yourself the right to ask for a committee when you had framed your charge sheet?
('72', 24, 3, 9, 43865) So far as I can see the matter can only be closed by leading against Sardar Vallabhbhai all the evidence you have in your possession or by making a clear admission that you have nothing against him.
('72', 24, 3, 10, 44064) Can you not see that the Working Committee's decision so far as it goes is wholly against you?
('72', 24, 3, 11, 44159) If you regard its verdict as final, then can you sit still when unbounded vilification of the Sardar is going on in front of you, and to which, in your letters, you have allowed yourself to be a party up to a certain extent?
('72', 24, 3, 12, 44384) You will be committing no breach of faith with me if you were to publish the whole of the conversation between you and me, if you will let me have beforehand what you will publish.
('72', 24, 3, 13, 44565) There are other inaccuracies in your letter which I need not go into.
('72', 24, 3, 14, 44635) Let me be however clear about one point.
('72', 24, 3, 15, 44676) So long as you feel that the Sardar has dealt with you unfairly in any shape or form, or that he has done anything ungentlemanly, it is your bounden duty to accept his offer.
('72', 24, 3, 16, 44851) You owe it to yourself and to a colleague, who emphatically maintains that he has never done or meant any harm to
('72', 24, 4, 17, 44965) 1 Dated July 14, which read: "I am being charged for defying and attempting to circumvent the Working Committee Resolution at Delhi and Wardha by demanding an independent tribunal.
('72', 24, 4, 18, 45146) In the .
('72', 24, 4, 19, 45155) .conversation I had with you, I had made it clear that I could accept such a tribunal only if the Working Committee sanctioned it .
('72', 24, 4, 20, 45287) Before the Working Committee too, I made my position clear that I did not want .
('72', 24, 4, 21, 45368) an independent tribunal .
('72', 24, 4, 22, 45394) if the Working Committee did not sanction .
('72', 24, 4, 23, 45438) I further made it clear to the Secretary that the tribunal should only make a report .
('72', 24, 4, 24, 45525) to the Working Committee who should .
('72', 24, 4, 25, 45563) pronounce verdict .
('72', 24, 4, 26, 45583) .But in view of the definite adverse view of all the members I did not intend to pursue the matter further .

('72', 25, 1, 3, 45857) If you do not pursue the tribunal you repeatedly told me you wanted, or drop it without unreservedly withdrawing your charge against the Sardar, you will be committing a grave blunder.
('72', 25, 1, 4, 46042) Your colleagues of the Working Committee will certianly come to the conclusion that you were simply guided by your own suspicion though you had nothing whatsover to sustain it.
('72', 25, 1, 5, 46219) And you would confirm the impression that the Sardar has carried with him about your conduct at the Bombay election, and which he so frankly told you during that drive.

('72', 25, 6, 13, 46683) Before I do so I should like to have your confirmation of the report.
('72', 25, 6, 14, 46753) For, I know, how often public speeches are misreported, sometimes consciously, sometimes unconsciously.

The report said that N.C. Kelkar, speaking at a meeting in Poona at the Tilak Smarak Mandir, had alleged that Gandhiji had refused to sign on the application for the release of Savarkar; that Gandhiji's attitude towards Maharashtrians, including great leaders like Tilak was not friendly and that Gandhiji's readiness for office acceptance was not consistent with his earlier stand.

('72', 27, 3, 4, 49066) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, I read your letters regarding Nariman.
('72', 27, 3, 5, 49123) I am not in the least getting frightened.
('72', 27, 3, 6, 49165) According to me there is no need for you to say anything now.
('72', 27, 3, 7, 49227) I have started writing to Nariman.
('72', 27, 3, 8, 49262) When the time for making a public statement comes, I will certainly do so.
('72', 27, 3, 9, 49337) It is not at all surprising that not a single newspaper is on your side.
('72', 27, 3, 10, 49410) After all, what kind of newspapers are these?
('72', 27, 3, 11, 49456) Why should we get elated if they take our side?
('72', 27, 3, 12, 49504) I am sure you will be able to deal with Munshi and Bhulabhai.
('72', 27, 3, 13, 49566) The thing is beyond me.

('72', 27, 3, 15, 49639) If you don't get a reply from Maulana even after you have sent him a wire, two courses are open to you: to appoint whosoever seems the fittest to you, or to declare publicly that anybody selected by Maulana will be appointed.
('72', 27, 3, 16, 49865) We know Maulana's tardiness.
('72', 27, 3, 17, 49894) But the problem about a Muslim secretary is a difficult one.
('72', 27, 3, 18, 49955) I think we can escape the difficulty only by putting the thing publicly in .
('72', 27, 4, 19, 50032) Why don't you wire to Jawaharlal that he should either send Maulana's consent or make an alternative suggestion?
('72', 27, 4, 20, 50145) You have been sending away your brothers too soon.
('72', 27, 4, 21, 50196) 2 They will reserve places for us somewhere.

('72', 28, 3, 7, 50857) I hope he will start eating properly.
('72', 28, 3, 8, 50895) For some time now he has developed aversion to food.
('72', 28, 3, 9, 50948) If you wish, I may arrange temporarily or permanently to send someone from here who will carry the mail from here and bring it from there.
('72', 28, 3, 10, 51087) I will experience no difficulty in sparing a person from here.
('72', 28, 3, 11, 51150) Durga's case is not simple.
('72', 28, 3, 12, 51178) One should inhale steam when having cold.
('72', 28, 3, 13, 51220) One should also fast occasionally.
('72', 28, 3, 14, 51255) Why shouldn't she come and stay here for a few days?
('72', 28, 3, 15, 51308) Nirmala also should come, so that I may not be put to any trouble.
('72', 28, 3, 16, 51375) I will merely suggest remedies after examining her.
('72', 28, 3, 17, 51427) I am sure that Durga can be completely cured.
('72', 28, 3, 18, 51473) I don't mean to say that it can be done only through my remedies.
('72', 28, 3, 19, 51539) What is Kumarappa's difficulty?

('72', 28, 3, 23, 51692) There must be somebody from the municipal builders.
('72', 28, 3, 24, 51744) If I am allowed I will write.

('72', 29, 11, 23, 53312) Your letter is full of untruths.
('72', 29, 11, 24, 53345) I am sending it back to you so that you can see for yourself.
('72', 29, 11, 25, 53407) You seem to have mentioned only Jani in it.
('72', 29, 11, 26, 53451) You have thus started with an untruth.
('72', 29, 11, 27, 53490) If you had from the beginning wished to join a renowed institution like the Kangri, why did you not go there straightaway?
('72', 29, 11, 28, 53613) In your description of Ishver Ramji's 'hesitant policy", you have unnecessarily maligned the institution in which you stayed.
('72', 29, 11, 29, 53739) The letter which he has written to me on his own is in a different vein altogether.

('72', 30, 1, 2, 53897) Your first sentence suggests excessive respect while what you really feel is helplessness.
('72', 30, 1, 3, 53988) Look at your totalling in the third sentence: 75+5=100!
('72', 30, 1, 4, 54044) Is this dreaming?
('72', 30, 1, 5, 54062) You had resolved in my presence to preserve humility.
('72', 30, 1, 6, 54116) It has been established that you do not have sufficient knowledge.
('72', 30, 1, 7, 54183) What a big claim you make in your fourth sentence?
('72', 30, 1, 8, 54234) “I will be able to teach English, science, etc., according to the latest method.” Can you justify this claim?
('72', 30, 1, 9, 54344) The sentence thereafter is equally insufferable.
('72', 30, 1, 10, 54393) In all the institutions that you have mentioned you say, “and that too in the capacity of a Principal”.
('72', 30, 1, 11, 54497) Is not this the limit of deliberate lying?
('72', 30, 1, 12, 54540) Have you merit enough to say, “You will be fully satisfied with my work and it will also bring you credit”?
('72', 30, 2, 13, 54648) See the shabbiness of the whole letter.
('72', 30, 2, 14, 54688) The handwriting is all a mess.
('72', 30, 2, 15, 54719) What impatience !
('72', 30, 2, 16, 54737) The word “immediately” occurs thrice.
('72', 30, 2, 17, 54775) Devasharma has a royal heart.
('72', 30, 2, 18, 54805) He was almost ready to take you.
('72', 30, 2, 19, 54838) Even now, if I urge him, he would do so.
('72', 30, 2, 20, 54879) I would throw a letter like this from a stranger into the waste paper basket.
('72', 30, 2, 21, 54957) Your letter itself proves your unfitness.
('72', 30, 2, 22, 54999) Where did you pass the three examinations which qualify you as a teacher?
('72', 30, 2, 23, 55073) [You say,] “One runs up to your Ashram just to purify oneself by living on the holy land.” All right, run on!
('72', 30, 2, 24, 55183) I feel more pain in writing this letter than you will in reading it.
('72', 30, 2, 25, 55252) I have absolutely no time to write such a long letter, but I could not control my pen.
('72', 30, 2, 26, 55339) You address me as "father" and describe yourself as my son.
('72', 30, 2, 27, 55399) Is not there hypocrisy even in this?
('72', 30, 2, 28, 55436) However, I will not disown you.
('72', 30, 2, 29, 55468) But you will have to help me.
('72', 30, 2, 30, 55498) Go to Sabarmati on the 20th, a changed man.
('72', 30, 2, 31, 55542) You will not get such an opportunity again.
('72', 30, 2, 32, 55586) If, however, you don’t wish to go, you are free.

('72', 31, 2, 3, 55841) SEGON (WARDHA), July 16, 1937
('72', 31, 3, 4, 55871) MY DEAR MALKANI, Why don’t you steal in a note in The Hindustan Times advertising your wares or write to The Hindustan Times a letter to be published in the correspondents’ column, complaining of public apathy and telling the public what attactive things can be had there?
('72', 31, 3, 5, 56144) 1 Secondly, Why don’t you have a list of the things you have for sale and post the same to likely addresses in Delhi?
('72', 31, 3, 6, 56262) You are bound to get some orders.
('72', 31, 3, 7, 56296) Thirdly, you can engage a hawker who can hawk about your things on commission.
('72', 31, 3, 8, 56375) Fourthly, sometimes you can pay visits to friends yourself and get their orders.
('72', 31, 3, 9, 56456) If you just learn enough of the tailoring and shoemaking technique, you can take measurements yourself.
('72', 31, 3, 10, 56560) Shrimati Rameshwari Nehru is sporting a pair of slippers or some such thing from your colony.
('72', 31, 3, 11, 56654) They have given her blisters all over.
('72', 31, 3, 12, 56693) Now, your department has to turn out first class articles if you are to command a large custom.
('72', 31, 3, 13, 56789) Then you mention the trouble about getting workers in the Provinces to interest themselves more than they are doing.
('72', 31, 3, 14, 56906) Of course this is a universal complaint.
('72', 31, 3, 15, 56947) We are not slaves without deserving our slavery.
('72', 31, 3, 16, 56996) Then, about the boys themselves, why should you not so arrange your departments as to absorb all the boys in the colony.
('72', 31, 3, 17, 57117) Then they would be earning a decent livelihood and you will produce master tailors, master shoemakers, etc.
('72', 31, 3, 18, 57225) I am surprised that you, as a teacher, can feel lazy and say, you have’t enough to do.
('72', 31, 3, 19, 57312) With eighteen children for whose welfare you are wholly responsible and to whom you are both father and mother, I should have thought that you had more than you could manage.
('72', 31, 3, 20, 57487) Can you imagine a widowed father having eighteen children to care for feeling lazy and with time hanging heavy over him?
('72', 31, 3, 21, 57608) That sentence in your letter is a disturbing sentence.
('72', 31, 3, 22, 57663) You know what I mean.

('72', 32, 2, 3, 57915) July 16, 1937 You are hard on poor Sen.
('72', 32, 2, 4, 57955) Surely there are meat eaters who are as good brahmacharis and as abstemious as any vegetarians.
('72', 32, 2, 5, 58051) The physical effect of milk is the same almost as of flesh [or] meat.
('72', 32, 2, 6, 58121) Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Roman Catholic monks and nuns are not to be beaten in their self restraint in everything.
('72', 32, 2, 7, 58243) Purity of personal life is not a monopoly of vegetarians not kindness.
('72', 32, 2, 8, 58314) Do you know vegetarians who know not what self restraint is, no kindness to human or sub human life?
('72', 32, 2, 9, 58415) Who can be more cruel to man and beast than some vegetarian husbands, fathers and cattleowners?
('72', 32, 2, 10, 58511) We must not make a fetish of our vegetarianism and be intolerant.
('72', 32, 2, 11, 58577) Let us not attribute more virtue to vegetarianism than it can carry.
('72', 32, 2, 12, 58646) And so long as we must take milk, it is wrong to call ourselves vegetarians or non flesh eaters.
('72', 32, 2, 13, 58743) Distinction there is, but ir is not the restriction which you seem to think there is.
('72', 32, 2, 14, 58829) It is only real godliness that alters the whole course of life.

('72', 32, 6, 18, 58995) MAHADEV, Bhansali has returned and is already a familiar face by now.
('72', 32, 6, 19, 59065) The assistant doctor applied caustic to the wound and dressed it.
('72', 32, 6, 20, 59131) He also added that the trouble must have come on partly because he does not eat rotlis.
('72', 32, 6, 21, 59219) It is absolutely necessary now that he should see Balkrishna.
('72', 32, 6, 22, 59281) Bhansali can see him even after two days when he goes there again.
('72', 32, 6, 23, 59348) It will be better, of course, if he comes over here to see him.
('72', 32, 6, 24, 59412) If Bhansali goes to Wardha, he should do so after fixing the time in advance, so that he might not miss the Civil Surgeon.
('72', 32, 6, 25, 59535) I don’t know how I can persuade Durga.
('72', 32, 6, 26, 59574) At present we have engaged a maidservant for washing clothes.
('72', 32, 6, 27, 59636) Gradually such arrangements are being made here.
('72', 32, 6, 28, 59685) She may stay here for a few days and, if she doesn’t feel at ease, may go back.
('72', 32, 6, 29, 59765) There are no restrictions
('72', 33, 0, 1, 59791) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 34

('72', 33, 12, 20, 60432) This time I have removed from your article the portion in which you have replied to Syed.
('72', 33, 12, 21, 60522) For the present let them say what they wish.
('72', 33, 12, 22, 60567) We should go on writing what we ourselves think proper.
('72', 33, 12, 23, 60623) Please, therefore, go through the extract I have given from Tandonji’s letter.
('72', 33, 12, 24, 60702) I have also supplied an extract for Harijan from Pattabhi’s speech.
('72', 33, 12, 25, 60770) I have inserted that, too, in your article.
('72', 33, 12, 26, 60814) If you do not like it, you may remove it.
('72', 33, 12, 27, 60856) It can be said that I have written a political article 3 for Harijan this time.
('72', 33, 12, 28, 60936) Go through it If you don’t approve of it, you can wait.
('72', 33, 12, 29, 60992) And if you find it all right, an advance copy may be supplied to

('72', 34, 1, 3, 61528) I cannot make up my mind.
('72', 34, 1, 4, 61554) How can I possibly get time to talk to Kanu today?
('72', 34, 1, 5, 61605) Both Shambhudayal and Janba should take plentry of quinine.
('72', 34, 1, 6, 61665) They should not eat chapatis.
('72', 34, 1, 7, 61695) At the most they may take milk, jaggery and fruit if available.
('72', 34, 1, 8, 61759) I will attend to the receipts, etc., tomorrow.
('72', 34, 1, 9, 61806) I can’t detain Kanu today.
('72', 34, 1, 10, 61833) I don’t think Nariman’s reply calls for a rejoinder.
('72', 34, 1, 11, 61886) There is nothing in it to suggest that he is on the war path.
('72', 34, 1, 12, 61948) He seems to have calmed down.

('72', 34, 4, 16, 62058) 49. CONGRESS MINISTRIES
('72', 34, 5, 17, 62082) Since the Working Committee and other Congressmen have allowed themselves to be influenced by my opinion on the office issue, it is perhaps due to the public for me to explain my conception of office acceptance and what is possible to do in terms of the Congress election menifesto.
('72', 34, 5, 18, 62365) I need offer no apology for crossing the self imposed limit in the conduct of Harijan.
('72', 34, 5, 19, 62452) The reason is obvious.
('72', 34, 5, 20, 62475) The Government of India Act is universally regarded as wholly unsatisfactory for achieving India’s freedom.
('72', 34, 5, 21, 62583) But it is possible to consture it as an attempt, however limited and feeble, to replace the rule of the sword by the rule of the majority.
('72', 34, 5, 22, 62722) The creation of the big electorate of three crores of men and women and the placing of wide powers in their hands cannot be described by any other name.
('72', 34, 5, 23, 62875) Underlying it is the hope that what has been imposed upon us we shall get to like, i.e., we shall really regard our exploitation as a blessing in the end.
('72', 34, 5, 24, 63030) The hope may be frustrated if the representatives of the thirty million voters have a faith of their own and are intelligent enough to use the powers (including the holding of offices) placed in their hands for the purpose of thwarting the assumed intention of the framers of the Act.
('72', 34, 5, 25, 63315) And this can be easily done by lawfully using the Act in a manner not expected by them and by refraining from using it in the way intended by them.
('72', 34, 5, 26, 63463) Thus the Ministries may enforce immediate prohibition by making education self supporting instead of paying for it from the liquor revenue.
('72', 34, 5, 27, 63603) This may appear a startling proposition, but I hold it
('72', 35, 0, 1, 63658) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 36
('72', 35, 1, 2, 63699) perfectly feasible and eminently reasonable.
('72', 35, 1, 3, 63744) The jails may be turnecd into reformatories and workshops.
('72', 35, 1, 4, 63803) They should be self supporting and educational instead of being spending and punitive departments.
('72', 35, 1, 5, 63902) In accordance with the Irwin Gandhi Pact, of which only the Salt Clause remains still alive, salt should be free for the poor man, but it is not; it can now be free in Congress Provinces at least.
('72', 35, 1, 6, 64099) All purchases of cloth should be in khadi.
('72', 35, 1, 7, 64142) The attention should now be devoted more to the villages and the peasantry than to the cities.
('72', 35, 1, 8, 64237) These are but illustrations taken at random.
('72', 35, 1, 9, 64282) They are perfectly lawful, and yet not one of them has as yet even been attempted.
('72', 35, 1, 10, 64365) Then the personal behaviour of Ministers.
('72', 35, 1, 11, 64407) How will Congress Ministers discharge themselves?
('72', 35, 1, 12, 64457) Their Chief, the Presidentt of the Congress, travels third class.
('72', 35, 1, 13, 64523) Will they travel first?
('72', 35, 1, 14, 64547) The President is satisfied with a coarse khadi dhoti, Kurta and waistcoat.
('72', 35, 1, 15, 64622) Will the Ministers require the Western style and expenditure on Western scale?
('72', 35, 1, 16, 64701) Congressmen have for the past seventeen years disciplined themselves in rigorous simplicity.
('72', 35, 1, 17, 64794) The nation will expect the Ministers to introduce simplicity in the administration of their Provinces.
('72', 35, 1, 18, 64897) They will not be ashamed of it, they will be proud of it.
('72', 35, 1, 19, 64955) We are the poorest nation on earth, many millions living in semi srarvation.
('72', 35, 1, 20, 65032) Its representatives dare not live in a style and manner out of all correspondence with their electors.
('72', 35, 1, 21, 65135) The Englishmen coming as conquerors and rulers set up a standard of living which took no account whatsoever of the helpless conquered.
('72', 35, 1, 22, 65270) If the Ministers will simply refrain from copying the Governors and the secured Civil Service, they will have shown the marked contrast that exists between the Congress mentality and theirs.
('72', 35, 1, 23, 65461) Truly there can be no partnership between them and us even as there can be none between a gaint and a dwarf.
('72', 35, 1, 24, 65570) Lest Congressmen should think that they have a monopoly of simplicity and that they erred in 1920 in doing away with the trousers and the chair, let me cite the examples of Aboobaker and Omar.
('72', 35, 1, 25, 65763) Rama and Krishna are prehistoric names.
('72', 35, 1, 26, 65803) I may not use these names as examples.
('72', 35, 1, 27, 65842) History tells us of Pratap and Shivaji living in uttermost simplicity.
('72', 35, 1, 28, 65913) But opinion may be divided as to what they did when they had power.
('72', 35, 1, 29, 65981) There is no division of opinion about the Prophet, Aboobaker and Omar.
('72', 35, 1, 30, 66052) They had the riches of the world at their feet.
('72', 35, 1, 31, 66100) It will be difficult to find a historical parallel to match their rigorous
('72', 36, 0, 1, 66175) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY, 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 37
('72', 36, 1, 2, 66219) Omar would not brook the idea of his lieutenants in distant provinces using anything but coarse cloth and coarse flour.
('72', 36, 1, 3, 66339) The Congress Ministers, if they will retain the simplicity and economy they have inherited since 1920, will save thousands of rupees, will give hope to the poor and probably change the tone of the Services.
('72', 36, 1, 4, 66546) It is hardly necessary for me to point out that simplicity does not mean shoddiness.
('72', 36, 1, 5, 66631) There is a beauty and an art in simplicity which he who runs may see.
('72', 36, 1, 6, 66701) It does not require money to be neat, clean and dignified.
('72', 36, 1, 7, 66760) Pomp and pageantry are often synonymous with vulgarity.
('72', 36, 1, 8, 66816) This unostentatious work must be the prelude to demonstrating the utter insufficiency of the Act to meet the wishes of the people and the determination to end it.
('72', 36, 1, 9, 66979) The English Press has been at pains to divide India into Hindu and Muslim.
('72', 36, 1, 10, 67054) The Congress majority Provinces have been dubbed Hindu, the other five Muslim.
('72', 36, 1, 11, 67133) That this is demonstrably false has not worried them.
('72', 36, 1, 12, 67187) My great hope is that the Ministers in the six Provinces will so manage them as to disarm all suspicion.
('72', 36, 1, 13, 67292) They will show their Muslim colleagues that they know no distinction between Hindu, Muslim, Christian or Sikh or Parsi.
('72', 36, 1, 14, 67412) Nor will they know any distinction between high caste and low caste Hindus.
('72', 36, 1, 15, 67488) They will demonstrate in every action of theirs that with them all are the sons of the soil among whom there is no one low and no one high.
('72', 36, 1, 16, 67628) Poverty and climate are common to all without distinction.
('72', 36, 1, 17, 67687) The major problems are identical for all of them.
('72', 36, 1, 18, 67737) And whilst, so far as we can judge from actions, the goal of the English system is wholly different from ours, the men and women representing the two goals belong to the same human family.
('72', 36, 1, 19, 67926) They will now be thrown together as they never have been before.
('72', 36, 1, 20, 67991) If the human reading that I have given to the Act is correct, the two parties meet together, each with its own history, background and goal, to convert one another.
('72', 36, 1, 21, 68156) Corporations are wooden and soulless but not those who work them or use them.
('72', 36, 1, 22, 68234) If the Englishmen or Anglicized Indians can but see the Indian which is the Congress viewpoint, the battle is won by the Congress and complete independence will come to us without shedding a drop of blood.
('72', 36, 1, 23, 68440) This is what I call the non violent approach.
('72', 36, 1, 24, 68486) It may be foolish, visionary, imprectical; never theless it is best that Congressmen, other Indians and Englishmen should know it.
('72', 36, 1, 25, 68617) This office acceptance is not intended to work the Act anyhow.
('72', 36, 1, 26, 68680) In the prosecution by the Congress of its goal of complete independence, it is a serious attempt on the one hand to avoid a
('72', 37, 0, 1, 68804) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 38
('72', 37, 1, 2, 68845) bloody revolution and on the other to avoid mass civil disobedience on a scale hitherto not attempted.
('72', 37, 1, 3, 68948) May God bless it.

('72', 37, 4, 10, 69309) I may say that my faith in khadi has, if anything, grown stronger today than what it was twenty years ago.
('72', 37, 4, 11, 69416) At any rate it has not diminished.

('72', 37, 7, 15, 69569) July 17, 1937
('72', 37, 8, 16, 69583) One answer to all your doubts and questions is this.
('72', 37, 8, 17, 69636) One is said to fall, i.e., completely rely, on Ramanama when one does so through the heart.
('72', 37, 8, 18, 69728) If you think that you have not attained success, the only inference is that your prayer does not come from the heart, it comes only from the lips.
('72', 37, 8, 19, 69875) That does not mean that you are not sincere but it does mean that your prayer has some connection with the result that you want to attain and since as a good Hindu you believe in prayer, you think you are complying with all the requirements when you utter the prayer with your lips.
('72', 37, 8, 20, 70158) Utterance with the lips is no doubt necessary, but in order to perceive the efficacy of prayer it has to find its place in the heart.
('72', 37, 8, 21, 70292) The only way to test the question whether it has permeated the heart is by finding whether there is real peace of mind.
('72', 37, 8, 22, 70412) For answer to prayer does not mean that you should get what you
('72', 37, 9, 23, 70476) 1 This was a note appended to a pamphlet by Narandas Gandhi in connection with the birthday celebration of Gandhiji.

('72', 38, 1, 3, 70973) The illustration that I can give from life is that whenever I have been assailed in difficult situations by anxiety or doubts they have been dispelled by prayer, and peace has taken the place of depression.

('72', 38, 6, 10, 71336) Fruit this time has been most welcome because it was needed badly.
('72', 38, 6, 11, 71403) I can’t get good oranges or musambis in Bombay.
('72', 38, 6, 12, 71451) And I need them for patients or some patients.
('72', 38, 6, 13, 71498) You may therefore send me such musambis whenever you can.
('72', 38, 6, 14, 71556) Our understanding is that they must be reasonably cheap.
('72', 38, 6, 15, 71613) I suppose I could get almost any fruit if I do not count the cost.
('72', 38, 6, 16, 71680) But that must not be.
('72', 38, 6, 17, 71702) I did take the musambis but I dared not take more than two when there were others in greater need.

('72', 39, 8, 11, 72560) Our faith proves itself only when it stands firm when unpenetrable darkness surrounds.
('72', 39, 8, 12, 72647) “God is the strength of the weak” 2 or “So long as the elephant relied on his own strength he could not succeed ” 3. These are bits from life lived.
('72', 39, 8, 13, 72796) And what is death ‘but a sleep and a forgetting’?

('72', 39, 8, 15, 72908) “It is good that the snare is broken, now I will get nearer to God,” 4 sang the bhakta, Narasinha Mehta.

('72', 39, 8, 18, 73083) Bhajans, even vocal repetition of Ramanama, may prove unavailing.
('72', 39, 8, 19, 73149) Faith overflowing demands no vocal demonstration.
('72', 39, 8, 20, 73199) It is enough if the heart grasps the reality.
('72', 39, 8, 21, 73245) If God is too vague, Truth surely is not.
('72', 39, 8, 22, 73287) And Truth is God.

('72', 40, 1, 2, 73604) 56. LETTER TO K. F. NARIMAN
('72', 40, 2, 3, 73632) July 17, 1937
('72', 40, 3, 4, 73646) MY DEAR NARIMAN, Sir Govindrao 1 has sent me a copy of his letter to you.
('72', 40, 3, 5, 73720) In the covering letter he gives me an extract from your letter to him.
('72', 40, 3, 6, 73791) From you letters to the Working Committee and from your letter to Sir Govindrao I see that, in your excitement, which has become chronic with you, you have lost even your legal acumen.
('72', 40, 3, 7, 73976) The more I think of this wretched quarrel, the clearer I am becoming that your grievance is wholly imaginary and that, by allowing the agitation to continue, you are harming yourself and the public interest.
('72', 40, 3, 8, 74184) I would strongly advise you to take legal advice, and frame your indictment in a proper manner which anybody can understand.
('72', 40, 3, 9, 74309) I wholly endorse Sir Govindrao’s remark that your charge is too vague for any lawyer or judge to understand or decide upon.
('72', 40, 3, 10, 74433) In your reference, you are bound to refer to the charge of Sardar Vaallabhbhai having secretly poisoned the minds of the voters directly or indirectly in connection with the election of the leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party.
('72', 40, 3, 11, 74667) How I wish that you could see that you have made mountain out of a molehill.
('72', 40, 3, 12, 74744) Assuming that you were utterly innocent of the defeat of the Congress candidate at the Bombay election of 1934, and yet the Sardar persisted in believing that you were not innocent, and actuated the voters against you, how can you make that a cause of serious grievance?
('72', 40, 3, 13, 75015) These things will happen in public life.
('72', 40, 3, 14, 75056) Do we not often suspect the bona fides even of our companions and act upon those suspicions?
('72', 40, 3, 15, 75149) In your letter to Sir Govindrao, you say that your claims were defeated because of the allegations against you.
('72', 40, 3, 16, 75261) Has a public worker any claim to anything?
('72', 40, 3, 17, 75304) Had Jawaharlal any claim to the Presidentship of the Congress?
('72', 40, 3, 18, 75367) He may even try his level best to get elected, but why should he brood over his defeat?
('72', 40, 3, 19, 75455) Would he be justified in making that a cause of grievance against those who were responsible for his defeat?
('72', 40, 3, 20, 75564) And yet is it not this that you are doing, or is there anything more?
('72', 40, 3, 21, 75634) But Sardar Vallabhabahi has generously come forward to submit to an inquiry into your charge.
('72', 40, 3, 22, 75728) You resent this offer and make that an additional grievance.
('72', 40, 3, 23, 75789) What he believes about you he has
('72', 40, 4, 24, 75823) 1 Justice Govindrao Madgaonkar of Bombay High court
('72', 41, 0, 1, 75875) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 42
('72', 41, 1, 2, 75916) frankly told you and he undertakes to give the grounds of his belief to any impartial judge.
('72', 41, 1, 3, 76009) He tells you and the public that he never asked anyone to vote against you, and challenges you to prove the contrary.
('72', 41, 1, 4, 76127) What more can he do?
('72', 41, 1, 5, 76148) That you have failed to be elected is surely nobody’s fault, not even yours.
('72', 41, 1, 6, 76225) Bombay is not the Bombay Presidency.
('72', 41, 1, 7, 76262) If you have the ambition of leading Maharashtra, Karnataka and Gujarat, the field is still open to you.
('72', 41, 1, 8, 76366) The golden way is through utterly selfless service, surely, not through a baseless and hysterical agitation for which you must be held responsible.
('72', 41, 1, 9, 76514) The target of this agitation remains unharmed.
('72', 41, 1, 10, 76561) The Sardar has no parliamentary ambition.
('72', 41, 1, 11, 76603) He has no ambition for leadership either.
('72', 41, 1, 12, 76645) Nature has endowed him with certain qualities and he uses them.
('72', 41, 1, 13, 76709) You won’t find him going to the Press and complaining if he loses hold on the populace.
('72', 41, 1, 14, 76797) Therefore, why won’t you see and realize that in the end you will be the only loser?
('72', 41, 1, 15, 76882) Therefore, take the inquiry and let the judge or judges go into the whole matter, and if you do not want it, then bravely and hounourably declare that you had not weighed and valued things properly, and that now you see quite clearly that Sardar Vallabhbhai had nothing to do with your defeat.
('72', 41, 1, 16, 77176) For, that is so far as I can see, the whole of your allegation.
('72', 41, 1, 17, 77240) I think I told you in the course of our conversation that if you convince me that Sardar had poisoned the minds of the voters against you, I for one would cease to have the intimate public connection that I have with him.
('72', 41, 1, 18, 77462) He has told me repeatedly what he has said in his statement 1 which, as I say, was made at my instance.
('72', 41, 1, 19, 77566) You will regard this letter as coming from a friend who wishes well to you.

('72', 42, 3, 5, 77951) It was but proper that your statement regarding the Nariman affair should have been issued immediately.
('72', 42, 3, 6, 78055) What more can we expect from members of the Working Committee beside the resolution 1 it has passed?
('72', 42, 3, 7, 78156) If malicious attacks continue to be made, what can we do about them?
('72', 42, 3, 8, 78225) And who but Nariman will suffer in the end?
('72', 42, 3, 9, 78269) Yes, I can see that a lot of people will suffer if we submit to rowdyism.
('72', 42, 3, 10, 78343) But neither you nor anybody else is likely to submit to it.

('72', 44, 13, 28, 82110) Expenses were incurred for medical attendance, medicine and food.
('72', 44, 13, 29, 82176) For these there is a bill outstanding.
('72', 44, 13, 30, 82215) He is now in the tannery.

('72', 45, 6, 9, 82537) However, if you can arrange your programme as before, that will not be necessary.
('72', 45, 6, 10, 82619) In any case don’t be careless about food.
('72', 45, 6, 11, 82661) We will talk further when you go over here.

('72', 45, 11, 17, 82857) MAHADEV,
('72', 45, 12, 18, 82866) Did you get a copy of Nariman’s letter?
('72', 45, 12, 19, 82906) For since I had given you no time the day before yesterday, I thought I might send you one.
('72', 45, 12, 20, 82998) Shanta will go there today.
('72', 45, 12, 21, 83026) Keep her as long as she wishes and get full work out of her.
('72', 45, 13, 22, 83087) I will try to send the post from here by 2 o’clock.
('72', 45, 13, 23, 83139) I have gone through The Sentinel.
('72', 45, 13, 24, 83173) You may send back Shanta when you think proper.
('72', 45, 13, 25, 83221) She seems to me to be as pure as a pearl.
('72', 45, 13, 26, 83263) She has the passport.
('72', 45, 13, 27, 83285) I don’t mind your having kept back the letter to Anandpriya, though it was not necessary to do so.
('72', 45, 13, 28, 83384) My method of handling such matters is different.
('72', 45, 13, 29, 83433) Now we will think about the subject only after we have heard from Vallabhbhai.

('72', 46, 5, 8, 83827) July 18, 1937
('72', 46, 6, 9, 83841) BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS, I read all your letters with good care.
('72', 46, 6, 10, 83900) I had no time to write nor had I any inclination.
('72', 46, 6, 11, 83950) What could I write?
('72', 46, 6, 12, 83970) The situation was changing and developing every moment.
('72', 46, 6, 13, 84026) It did not seem proper to write anything in such circumstances.
('72', 46, 6, 14, 84090) It was imperative to write to others so that their replies could weigh with me as far as possible.
('72', 46, 6, 15, 84189) I cannot specify the impression your letters made on me.
('72', 46, 6, 16, 84246) But I can assert that the letters received from there did not influence me as much as happenings here.
('72', 46, 6, 17, 84349) It may be said that my condition was like that of a woman in labour.
('72', 46, 6, 18, 84418) She cannot give expression to all the turmoil taking place within her.
('72', 46, 6, 19, 84489) Now we know all that happened.
('72', 46, 6, 20, 84520) Let me state this much that whatever Jawaharlal said and did in the Working Committee was marvellous.
('72', 46, 6, 21, 84622) Even otherwise he held a high place in my esteem but now he has risen still higher.
('72', 46, 6, 22, 84706) The beauty of it is that it is so in spite of our continuing difference of opinion.
('72', 46, 6, 23, 84790) The real difficulty starts now.
('72', 46, 6, 24, 84822) It is good that the future depends upon our strength, truth, courage, firmness, hard work and duty.
('72', 46, 6, 25, 84922) What you are doing is right.
('72', 46, 6, 26, 84951) Let the authorities there understand that there is no ‘padding’ in the decision of the Working Committee.
('72', 46, 6, 27, 85057) Every word is significant and everything will be acted upon.
('72', 46, 6, 28, 85118) After all, what has been done has been done in the name of God, with the utmost faith in Him.
('72', 46, 6, 29, 85212) I hope you are well.
('72', 46, 6, 30, 85233) Remain so.

('72', 47, 3, 5, 85566) I can’t understand house rent allowance in addition to Rs. 500 and the distinction between Personal Assistant and Secretary.
('72', 47, 3, 6, 85691) But if you hold different views, please let me know.
('72', 47, 3, 7, 85744) You must be observing that I am attending to Nariman.
('72', 47, 3, 8, 85798) You should now leave everything to me.

('72', 49, 3, 4, 88288) MY DEAR DEO, I have now heard from Shri Kelkar.
('72', 49, 3, 5, 88336) He has forgotten to return the cutting which I had sent him.
('72', 49, 3, 6, 88397) 1 I, therefore send my reply from memory.
('72', 49, 3, 7, 88439) About Shri Savarkar, I did refuse to sign the memorial for, as I told those who came to me, it was wholly unnecessary as Shri Savarkar was bound to be released after the coming into force of the new Act, no matter who the Ministers were.
('72', 49, 3, 8, 88677) And that is what has happened.
('72', 49, 3, 9, 88708) The Savarkar Brothers, at least, know that whatever the differences between us as to certain fundamentals, I could never contemplate with equanimity their incarceration.
('72', 49, 3, 10, 88878) Perhaps, Dr. Savarkar 2 will bear me out when I say that I did whaever was in my power after my own way to secure their release.
('72', 49, 3, 11, 89007) And the barrister will perhaps recall the pleasant relations that existed between us when we met for the first time in London and how, when nobody was forthcoming, I presided at the meeting that was held in his honour in London.
('72', 49, 3, 12, 89236) As to my relations with the late Lokamanya Tilak, our defferences were well known and yet we were on the friendliest terms.
('72', 49, 3, 13, 89360) After all, you, Gangadharrao Deshpande and others who know me would perhaps testify that I yield to no one in my regard to Lokamanya for his burning patriotism, his fearlessness, his magnetic personality and his great learning.
('72', 49, 3, 14, 89588) As to office acceptance, I have not retraced my steps.
('72', 49, 3, 15, 89643) I have no repentance for the advice I gave in 1920 to boycott the Legislatures.
('72', 49, 3, 16, 89723) I have not a shadow of doubt that the abstention of the Congress deprived them of the false halo of glory which they had acquired.
('72', 49, 3, 17, 89854) In now strongly advising the Congress to send its representatives to the Legislatures and even to accept office I have responded to the wholly new circumstances that have since come into being.
('72', 49, 3, 18, 90048) I have never made a fetish of foolish consistency.

('72', 51, 3, 4, 91490) MANILAL SUSHILA, I sent one letter for you with Mr. Kallenbach.
('72', 51, 3, 5, 91554) I didn’t have your letters before me when I wrote it.
('72', 51, 3, 6, 91608) If what you write about Omar Sheth 1
('72', 51, 4, 7, 91645) is true, it is a sad chapter of his life.
('72', 51, 4, 8, 91687) If you think it would be proper for me to write about the matter.
('72', 51, 4, 9, 91753) I might do so.
('72', 51, 4, 10, 91768) Do you wish that I should write?
('72', 51, 4, 11, 91801) Ramdas has not gone there of his own accord.
('72', 51, 4, 12, 91846) I urged him to go.
('72', 51, 4, 13, 91865) He didn’t keep good health here in spite of all his efforts, and so Nimu suggested that I should send him to South Africa.
('72', 51, 4, 14, 91988) I accordingly made the suggestion to him.
('72', 51, 4, 15, 92030) The expenses were borne by Mr. Kallenbach.
('72', 51, 4, 16, 92073) I have even told Ramdas that if he wishes he might stay there as long as it might be necessary just for the sake of his health.
('72', 51, 4, 17, 92201) Let us see what happens now.
('72', 51, 4, 18, 92230) Sita’s 2 letter was a good one.
('72', 51, 4, 19, 92262) That doesn’t mean, however, that she should forget Gujarati.
('72', 51, 4, 20, 92323) If Sushila, or both of you, can come over, I would be happy.
('72', 51, 4, 21, 92384) But certainly not at the cost of the work there.
('72', 51, 4, 22, 92433) Now that Ramdas has gone there, you may think what can be done.

('72', 52, 12, 19, 93693) It was undated.
('72', 52, 12, 20, 93709) It must have been written before you got my letter.
('72', 52, 12, 21, 93761) I am enclosing my opinion for Tandonji’s benefit I have not yet been able to read today’s article.
('72', 52, 12, 22, 93860) I have forgotten what it was about Sholapur.
('72', 52, 12, 23, 93905) You may reply at any rate.
('72', 52, 12, 24, 93932) Let the thing take its own course.
('72', 52, 12, 25, 93967) I can’t recollect anything.

('72', 53, 3, 4, 94174) MAHADEV, I am sending today a good deal of material for Harijan.
('72', 53, 3, 5, 94239) If you have not sent a wire to Kher, send one as follows—and if you have already sent, send a revision: “Received yours and Guzarilal’s letter.
('72', 53, 3, 6, 94383) His objection seems unsurmountable.
('72', 53, 3, 7, 94419) Take all assistance from him.

('72', 53, 9, 18, 94821) We shall see later.
('72', 53, 9, 19, 94841) As I have already sent [most of] the material today, it was not possible to send this early.

('72', 53, 9, 21, 94979) But Kanu told me that the papers for Harijan would be sent later in the evening.

('72', 54, 2, 3, 95286) SEGAON, WARDHA, July 21, 1937
('72', 54, 3, 4, 95316) KANTI, I read both your letters.
('72', 54, 3, 5, 95349) You were keeping in touch with Amtul Salaam even in Bombay.
('72', 54, 3, 6, 95409) I have seen in your letters, too, that you are still clinging to her.
('72', 54, 3, 7, 95479) But I don’t think there is anything wrong in that.
('72', 54, 3, 8, 95530) In the beginning, of course, you made a mistake in showering thoughtless love on her, but there was no impurity even in that.
('72', 54, 3, 9, 95656) You shouldn’t, therefoe, completely break off your relation with her.
('72', 54, 3, 10, 95726) But there is no need at all for you to let her come to Bangalore, not even by way of atonement.
('72', 54, 3, 11, 95822) There is a no need for any atonement.
('72', 54, 3, 12, 95860) You are right in saying that she is a child.
('72', 54, 3, 13, 95905) My advice now is that you yourself should write directly to her and tell her that I had asked your opinion; and that it was foolishness on your part to have shown such excessive love.
('72', 54, 3, 14, 96089) You may tell her that her coming to Bangalore would not benefit either of you in any way, that on the contrary it would upset you, etc.
('72', 54, 3, 15, 96225) Write a fairly long and affectionate letter.
('72', 54, 3, 16, 96270) I will manage the rest.
('72', 54, 3, 17, 96294) Don’t worry about her being hurt.
('72', 54, 3, 18, 96328) Keep writing to her, but only postcards.
('72', 54, 3, 19, 96369) Don’t mind expense on a postcard every week.
('72', 54, 3, 20, 96414) She has asked me to send her your letters to me.
('72', 54, 3, 21, 96463) I will not send to the one about her, but will send the other one in which you have described your discussion with the Christian.
('72', 54, 3, 22, 96593) I will use my discretion every time.
('72', 54, 3, 23, 96630) I will thus satisfy her.
('72', 54, 3, 24, 96655) Try to bear with her having gone to Trivandrum.
('72', 54, 3, 25, 96703) Your admiration for her had its root in a beautiful sentiment.
('72', 54, 3, 26, 96766) Her sacrifice is beyond description.
('72', 54, 3, 27, 96803) Poor girl, she lacks intelligence and has bad health.
('72', 54, 3, 28, 96857) If her health improves and she gets strong, I hope to take much work from her.
('72', 54, 3, 29, 96936) Don’t cut her off completely, but don’t think from this, either, that deep in my heart I want you to permit her to go to Bangalore.
('72', 54, 3, 30, 97068) I fully endorse your decision on that point.
('72', 54, 3, 31, 97113) I am sending this reply by return of post.

('72', 55, 2, 3, 97365) SEGAON, WARDHA, July 22, 1937
('72', 55, 3, 4, 97395) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL, Maulana Saheb stopped for a day in Wardha and we had a long chat.
('72', 55, 3, 5, 97481) He showed me the draft agreement between Muslim League members of the Assembly and the Congress members.
('72', 55, 3, 6, 97586) 1 I thought it was a good document.
('72', 55, 3, 7, 97622) But he told me that whilst you liked it, Tandonji did not.
('72', 55, 3, 8, 97681) I have written to the latter about it as the Maulana suggested I should.
('72', 55, 3, 9, 97754) What is the objection?
('72', 55, 3, 10, 97777) The Rs. 500 salary with big house and car allowances is being severely criticized.
('72', 55, 3, 11, 97860) 2 The more I think of it, the more I dislike this extravagant beginning.
('72', 55, 3, 12, 97933) I talked about this, too, to the Maulana.

('72', 55, 8, 18, 98139) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, A word seems to be missing in Thakkar Bapa’s award.
('72', 55, 8, 19, 98209) 3 Have you gone through it?
('72', 55, 8, 20, 98237) If the missing words don’t affect the sense, I think that according to Bapa’s award the Municipality is bound to retain 185 men.
('72', 55, 8, 21, 98366) However, I am awaiting Dinkarrao’s letter.
('72', 55, 8, 22, 98409) Let him get the award interpreted by a lawyer and send the interpretation to me.
('72', 55, 8, 23, 98490) There is no question of my being liberal.
('72', 55, 8, 24, 98532) But if the award means that 185 men should be retained, how can we at all do anything else?
('72', 55, 8, 25, 98624) I should like you to read the award when you get the time.
('72', 55, 8, 26, 98683) I am sending a copy with this.
('72', 55, 8, 27, 98714) I will not hurry you, but you, too, should avoid needless delay.

('72', 56, 2, 4, 99163) Think over this.
('72', 56, 2, 5, 99180) The Municipality will have to pay Rs. 160 more by way of salaries.
('72', 56, 2, 6, 99247) If, however, it retrenches 25 persons, it will have a net saving of 25 x 11=275 160=115. Is this the meaning of Bapa’s decision?

('72', 57, 4, 8, 100357) We will think afterwards.
('72', 57, 4, 9, 100383) You can stitch clothes for Harijans.
('72', 57, 4, 10, 100420) There is enough to do there.

('72', 57, 8, 20, 100947) You know my opinion about you.
('72', 57, 8, 21, 100978) You never undertake any task beyond your capacity, and as you are straightforward you bring credit to whatever you undertake.
('72', 57, 8, 22, 101104) But in the sphere of what is known as politics, it is not the fittest men who are appointed to do particular jobs.
('72', 57, 8, 23, 101219) No leader can satisfy that criterion.
('72', 57, 8, 24, 101257) You should realize this and bear with what is happening.
('72', 57, 8, 25, 101314) I would expect even more from you.
('72', 57, 8, 26, 101349) You shouldn’t even think about such things.
('72', 57, 8, 27, 101393) One may accept whatever is offered to one, provided it is within one’s capacity, and never grieve over something not being offered.
('72', 57, 8, 28, 101525) When one has no other aim except service, where is the room for ambition?
('72', 57, 8, 29, 101599) And you are all out for service.
('72', 57, 8, 30, 101632) But since you have been overcome by ignorance, listen to me.
('72', 57, 8, 31, 101693) You have reached your present position through sheer merit.
('72', 57, 8, 32, 101753) And the service you are doing now is not small in any way.
('72', 57, 8, 33, 101812) You may become a Mayor and enter the All India field if you can through worthy efforts.

('72', 58, 1, 3, 102093) God knows why, but all over the world people pine for such positions.
('72', 58, 1, 4, 102163) Since from among the many candidates only a few can be selected, does it not follow that only those will be selected who have to included?
('72', 58, 1, 5, 102302) However, let your candidature be made known in a polite way.
('72', 58, 1, 6, 102363) Please understand the meaning of the word “polite” here.
('72', 58, 1, 7, 102420) One must observe the utmost delicacy when suggesting oneself as a candidate in such a matter.

('72', 59, 6, 9, 103810) 89. THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE
('72', 59, 7, 10, 103841) It is necessary to contemplate for a moment the fundamental difference between the old and the new order.
('72', 59, 7, 11, 103947) In order fully to realize it we must try to forget for the moment the crushing limitations of the Act.
('72', 59, 7, 12, 104050) Seeing that the Congress has gone to the farthest limit and has accepted office, let every Congressman note the power it has taken.
('72', 59, 7, 13, 104182) Whereas formerly the Ministers were amenable to the control of the Governors, now they are under the control of the Congress.
('72', 59, 7, 14, 104308) They are responsible to the Congress.
('72', 59, 7, 15, 104346) They owe their status to the Congress.
('72', 59, 7, 16, 104385) The Governors and the Civil Service though irremovable are yet answerable to the Ministers.
('72', 59, 7, 17, 104477) The Ministers have effective control over them up to a point.
('72', 59, 7, 18, 104539) That point enables them to consolidate the power of the Congress, i.e., the people.
('72', 59, 7, 19, 104623) The Ministers have the whip hand so long as they act within the four corners of the Act, no matter how distasteful their actions may be to the Governors.
('72', 59, 7, 20, 104777) It will be found upon examination that so long as the people remain non violent, the Congress Ministers have enough freedom of action for national growth.
('72', 59, 7, 21, 104932) For effective use of this power, the people have to give hearty co operation to the Congress and their Ministers.
('72', 59, 7, 22, 105046) If the latter do wrong or they neglect their duty, it is open to any person to complain to the Secretary of the A.I.C.C. and seek redress.
('72', 59, 7, 23, 105185) But no one may take the law into his own hands.

('72', 60, 1, 2, 105324) Congressmen should also realize that there is no other political party in the field to question the authority of the Congress.
('72', 60, 1, 3, 105451) For the other parties have never penetrated the villages.
('72', 60, 1, 4, 105509) And that is not a work which can be done in a day.
('72', 60, 1, 5, 105560) So far therefore, as I can see a vast opportunity is at the disposal of the Ministers in terms of the Congress objective of Complete Independence, if only they are honest, selfless, industrious, vigilant and solicitous for the true welfare of the starving millions.
('72', 60, 1, 6, 105826) No doubt, there is great validity in the argument that the Act has left the Ministers no money to spend for the nation building departments.
('72', 60, 1, 7, 105967) But this is largely an illusion.
('72', 60, 1, 8, 106000) I believe with Sir Daniel Hamilton that labour, and not metal, is real money.
('72', 60, 1, 9, 106078) Paper backed by labour is as good as, if not better than, paper backed by gold.
('72', 60, 1, 10, 106158) Here are the sentiments of an English financier 1 who has held high office in India:
('72', 60, 2, 11, 106243) The worst legacy we have left to India is a high grade Service.
('72', 60, 2, 12, 106307) What has been done cannot be undone.
('72', 60, 2, 13, 106344) I should now start something independent.
('72', 60, 2, 14, 106386) Whatever is being done today with ‘money motive’ should in future be based on ‘service motive’.
('72', 60, 2, 15, 106482) Why should teachers and doctors be paid high salaries?
('72', 60, 2, 16, 106537) Why cannot most of the work be done on a co operative basis?
('72', 60, 2, 17, 106598) Why should you worry about capital when there are seven hundred million hands to toil?
('72', 60, 2, 18, 106685) If things are done on a co operative basis, which in other words is modified socialism, money would not be needed, at least not in large quantity.
('72', 60, 2, 19, 106832) I find this verified in little Segaon.
('72', 60, 2, 20, 106871) The four hundred adults of Segaon can easily put ten thousand rupees annually into their pockets if only they would work as I ask them.
('72', 60, 2, 21, 107007) But they won’t.
('72', 60, 2, 22, 107023) They lack co operation, they do not know the art of intelligent labour, they refuse to learn anything new.
('72', 60, 2, 23, 107130) Untouchability blocks the way.
('72', 60, 2, 24, 107161) If someone presented them with one lakh of rupees, they would not turn it to account.
('72', 60, 2, 25, 107247) They are not responsible for this state of affairs.
('72', 60, 2, 26, 107299) We the middle class are.
('72', 60, 2, 27, 107324) What is true of Segaon is true of other villages.
('72', 60, 2, 28, 107374) They will respond by patient effort as they are responding in Segaon though ever so slowly.
('72', 60, 2, 29, 107466) The State, however, can do much in this direction with out having to spend a single pie extra.
('72', 60, 2, 30, 107561) The State officials can be utilized for serving the people instead of harassing them.
('72', 60, 2, 31, 107647) The villagers may not be coerced into doing anything.
('72', 60, 2, 32, 107701) They can be educated to do things which enrich them morally, mentally, physically and economically.

('72', 61, 2, 3, 107903) For the past four years monthly journal has been issued in Wardha called Maharashtra Khadi Patrika.
('72', 61, 2, 4, 108003) It has from month to month registered the progress of khadi in Maharashtra.
('72', 61, 2, 5, 108079) It has hitherto been issued in Marathi.
('72', 61, 2, 6, 108119) But its usefulness and the inclusion of Mahakoshal in the sphere of the Maharashtra Branch of the A.I.S.A. have necessitated conversion of the journal into Hindi.
('72', 61, 2, 7, 108282) The first number is before me.
('72', 61, 2, 8, 108313) The journal is a record of the great progress khadi has made under the very able guidance of Shri Jajuji assisted as he is by a devoted band of workers.
('72', 61, 2, 9, 108466) The price of the journal is only Re.
('72', 61, 2, 10, 108503) 1 per year, a single copy being 11/2 as.
('72', 61, 2, 11, 108544) It has no advertisements.
('72', 61, 2, 12, 108570) It has no padding.
('72', 61, 2, 13, 108589) It contains an unvarnished and faithful account of the progress of khadi within the jurisdiction of the Maharashtra Branch.
('72', 61, 2, 14, 108713) The work touches the social and economic life of the people who are engaged in it.
('72', 61, 2, 15, 108796) For the week, I wish to draw attention to a great experiment the branch is making in enabling spinning to yield a wage equal to any in the villages.
('72', 61, 2, 16, 108945) Three annas per day was the minimum accepted provisionally and in the transition stage instead of eight annas minimum I have aimed at.
('72', 61, 2, 17, 109080) If the buying public were to give intelligent and patriotic help, the objective can be achieved sooner than expected.
('72', 61, 2, 18, 109198) The present experiment is one of increasing wages by inducing the spinners to do their own carding.
('72', 61, 2, 19, 109298) The result has been most gratifying.
('72', 61, 2, 20, 109335) Sixteen workers spun for two weeks slivers carded for them and after being taught carding for one month they spun their own slivers.
('72', 61, 2, 21, 109468) The result was that in the place of 161 chhatanks 1, they spun in the same period 198, the average count increased from 14 to 18, the test from 55 to 59, their earnings from Rs. 12 4 0 to Rs. 24 0 3. This is a striking example of how with intelligence and application earnings can even be doubled.

('72', 62, 3, 5, 109943) How can you expect any mercy from me?
('72', 62, 3, 6, 109981) I can't approve of your princely salaries and additional princely house rent allowances and conveyance allowances.
('72', 62, 3, 7, 110096) Moreover, you will draw your salary at one rate and your secretary at another and lower rate, though both of you are guests of the same family.
('72', 62, 3, 8, 110240) Why such distinctions under the Congress flag?
('72', 62, 3, 9, 110287) When Vijayaraghavachari was President, Motilalji was secretary.
('72', 62, 3, 10, 110351) If we were paying salaries, would we have paid less to Motilalji?
('72', 62, 3, 11, 110417) To me this is like a fly in the very first morsel.
('72', 62, 3, 12, 110468) Take care of your health.
('72', 62, 3, 13, 110494) Don't let there be unpleasantness among yourselves.
('72', 62, 3, 14, 110546) Overcome co workers' anger with forbearance.

('72', 62, 8, 22, 110925) I am in constant correspondence with Nariman 2. His latest is a marvellous piece of impudence.

('72', 63, 7, 11, 112013) You should now forget all about the matter.
('72', 63, 7, 12, 112057) Ignore all attacks.
('72', 63, 7, 13, 112077) Surely you don't care for fame, do you?

('72', 63, 7, 17, 112366) Who can say which approach is better?
('72', 63, 7, 18, 112404) We can't compare them even on the basis of the results.
('72', 63, 7, 19, 112460) Even if my approach does not produce the desired result or produces a seemingly contrary result, I wouldn't give it up.
('72', 63, 7, 20, 112580) Nor would you give up yours.
('72', 63, 7, 21, 112609) This is a matter of the heart.
('72', 63, 7, 22, 112640) Isn't it but natural that everybody should follow his own?

('72', 66, 8, 32, 117040) I shall show it to the Sardar; and, if he approves, I shall ask Sir Govindrao to take evidence on it and give his decision.
('72', 66, 8, 33, 117164) The inquiry should be private.
('72', 66, 8, 34, 117195) I feel that the charge of Sardar having influenced the voters is inevitable.
('72', 66, 8, 35, 117272) For it he did not use

('72', 67, 1, 2, 117385) his opinion of you against your election.
('72', 67, 1, 3, 117427) There will be nothing for any judge to go upon so, whilst Sardar will have to give grounds for his opinion, you will have to prove that he used his opinion to influence the voters.
('72', 67, 1, 4, 117608) As for agitation, I see that you do not disapprove of it.
('72', 67, 1, 5, 117666) In my opinion it amounts to coercion.
('72', 67, 1, 6, 117704) Is there any obligation on the part of any leader to take a particular colleague into his Cabinet?
('72', 67, 1, 7, 117803) Whatever the public may say or do, I tell you that you are estranging your real friends from you by your permitting the agitation to continue as it is doing.
('72', 67, 1, 8, 117961) If you have accepted the Working Committee's judgment, you have to say so and acquit the Sardar of any complicity.
('72', 67, 1, 9, 118076) If you have not, and I think you have not, you have to prove your charge against the Sardar.
('72', 67, 1, 10, 118169) But when he offers to appear before a judge of joint choice, you are in honour bound to stop the agitation which hurts you .
('72', 67, 1, 11, 118294) and you only.
('72', 67, 1, 12, 118308) Please do not think me prejudiced against you because I write to you frankly.
('72', 67, 1, 13, 118386) My frankness is a test of my good wishes.
('72', 67, 1, 14, 118428) I daily receive letters asking me to intervene and give my opinion in public.
('72', 67, 1, 15, 118506) I am referring my correspondents to you telling them that so far as I am concerned, they have access to all my letters to you.
('72', 67, 1, 16, 118633) But I do not wish to say anything to the Press at this stage unless you want me.
('72', 67, 1, 17, 118714) I hope my letter is clear to you.
('72', 67, 1, 18, 118748) You have chosen an unfortunate illustration in Dr. Rajan’s case.
('72', 67, 1, 19, 118813) He carried on or continued no agitation.
('72', 67, 1, 20, 118854) He meekly submitted to the adverst verdict.

('72', 67, 6, 26, 119028) MAHADEV, I have been at this since morning.
('72', 67, 6, 27, 119072) I have not slept for more than half an hour since five.
('72', 67, 6, 28, 119128) I have just finished revising the article and have completed it.
('72', 67, 6, 29, 119193) I, therefore, could’t send Janba earlier.
('72', 67, 6, 30, 119235) I see that on Mondays the typing should be done here.

('72', 68, 6, 11, 119733) I had asked him if he would approve of your going there and also informed him that I was forwarding his letters to you.
('72', 68, 6, 12, 119853) He writes that he would not like your going to Bangalore, and he does not wish his letters to be passed on to you.
('72', 68, 6, 13, 119968) He says: “She may well pray that I may yet again develop filial love towards her but this is not the case.
('72', 68, 6, 14, 120075) I bear no more love towards her than what I bear towards the other womenfolk of the Ashram.” Hence I will not be able to let you go there, though I had wanted you to do so on your way back to the Ashram.
('72', 68, 6, 15, 120279) Do not take Kanti’s decision to heart.
('72', 68, 6, 16, 120318) I shall convey to you the news of his wellbeing.
('72', 68, 6, 17, 120367) By all means go to Bombay if necessary, for Baqui.
('72', 68, 6, 18, 120418) It might even be necessary to go in order to look after Mother.
('72', 68, 6, 19, 120482) It is possible that your short stay there might prove helpful to your brothers.

('72', 69, 2, 3, 120823) July 27, 1937
('72', 69, 3, 4, 120837) BHAI SAMPURNANAND, I had taken your book 1 to Tithal, and had started reading it there.
('72', 69, 3, 5, 120925) I finished it last Saturday, i.e., on July 24. I used to read it whenever I had a few minutes to spare.
('72', 69, 3, 6, 121029) I have read it carefully from cover to cover.
('72', 69, 3, 7, 121075) I liked the book, the language is sweet but it might also be regarded a bit difficult for those totally unacquainted with Sanskrit.
('72', 69, 3, 8, 121207) The glossary of English Hindi and Hindi English equivalents given at the end is useful for the student.
('72', 69, 3, 9, 121311) It is laudable that arguments in favour of socialism have been put forward without any disparagement of others.
('72', 69, 3, 10, 121423) I have no difficulty in accepting almost all the principles of socialism propounded in the book.
('72', 69, 3, 11, 121520) I have also read with care the book 2 by Jayaprakash.
('72', 69, 3, 12, 121574) Can there possibly be any difference between his interpretation and yours?
('72', 69, 3, 13, 121649) Neither in your book nor in his do I find a clear idea how the ultimate revolution in India will be brought about.
('72', 69, 3, 14, 121764) This I could not understand even after discussing it with many others.
('72', 69, 3, 15, 121835) Only the day before yesterday a report of Meherally’s Madras speech came into my hands and I went through it 3 .
('72', 69, 3, 16, 121948) It explains fully what the socialists are doing.
('72', 69, 3, 17, 121997) The object is to start a revolt in every sphere.
('72', 69, 3, 18, 122046) But a revolt has never been possible without violence.
('72', 69, 3, 19, 122101) In your book, however, I find nothing of the kind.
('72', 69, 3, 20, 122152) Have we or have not we acquired strength through peaceful ways such as the civil disobedience or non violent non co operation carried on since 1920?
('72', 69, 3, 21, 122301) You say that the principles of socialism cannot be fully implemented until we have State power.
('72', 69, 3, 22, 122397) Supposing, you ask, a powerful land owner turned a complete socialist, could he well and truly act upon his principles?
('72', 69, 3, 23, 122517) Assuming that he had no punitive power, could an Indian raja who was a socialist be able to implement socialism?
('72', 69, 3, 24, 122630) I recollect your having written that socialism cannot be practised in its entirety until the whole world turns socialist.
('72', 69, 3, 25, 122752) Does this imply that even if we gain complete independence socialism will not

('72', 70, 1, 3, 123036) I hope you have understood my point.
('72', 70, 1, 4, 123073) The purpose behind this question is only to ascertain how far it would be possible for me to accept the socialist principles and the means of their implementation.

('72', 71, 3, 6, 124726) You won’t wait even whilst you are in correspondence with me.

('72', 71, 3, 8, 124836) I want to avoid it if I can.
('72', 71, 3, 9, 124865) The Working Committee has never refused to give you a tribunal.

('72', 71, 3, 12, 125142) If you do not want me to do so, shall I make a statement of my impressions that have been made upon me throughout this sad episode?

('72', 73, 2, 3, 128152) SEGAON, WARDHA, July 30, 1937
('72', 73, 3, 4, 128182) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL, I hope Mahadev told you yesterday in addition to acknowledging your essay on Hindi 1 that the Viceroy had invited me to Delhi on the 4th for no special reason but merely to have the pleasure of meeting him.
('72', 73, 3, 5, 128409) I replied 2 saying that he had anticipated me for I wanted to seek an interview with him about the ban on Khan Saheb and my desire to visit the Frontier.
('72', 73, 3, 6, 128563) I am accordingly reaching Delhi on the 4th.
('72', 73, 3, 7, 128607) The appointment is for 11.30. Therefore, I hope to be able to leave the same day, returning to Segaon on the 5th.
('72', 73, 3, 8, 128721) But this letter is to send you a copy of Zakir's letter in reply to my letter giving my reaction to the recent riot in Bombay and the wretched Hindi Urdu controversy.
('72', 73, 3, 9, 128888) I thought that I should share with you this considered letter.
('72', 73, 3, 10, 128951) I do not regard the Jhansi election as a rout.
('72', 73, 3, 11, 128998) It is an honourable defeat, giving rise to the hope that if we plod away we can effectively take the Congress message to the Mussalmans.
('72', 73, 3, 12, 129135) But I still abide by my opinion that the mere taking of the message unaccompanied by substantial work in the villages won't answer our purpose in the end.
('72', 73, 3, 13, 129290) But it all depends upon the way in which we want to generate power.
('72', 73, 3, 14, 129358) Meherally's speech in Madras is an eye opener for me.
('72', 73, 3, 15, 129412) I wonder how far he represents the general socialistic view.
('72', 73, 3, 16, 129473) Rajaji has sent me a cutting containing his speech.
('72', 73, 3, 17, 129525) I hope he has sent a copy to you also.
('72', 73, 3, 18, 129564) I call it a bad speech of which you should take notice.
('72', 73, 3, 19, 129620) This is going contrary to the Congress policy as I read it.
('72', 73, 3, 20, 129680) There is also Roy's speech at Madras.
('72', 73, 3, 21, 129718) I take it, you get all such cuttings.
('72', 73, 3, 22, 129756) Nevertheless, for ready reference I enclose the cuttings which Pyarelal has made for me.

('72', 73, 3, 24, 129878) You should see his latest letter.
('72', 73, 3, 25, 129912) It will go with this if I have not destroyed it.
('72', 73, 3, 26, 129961) What is your reaction to his attitude?
('72', 73, 3, 27, 130000) As I have already told you I find it difficult to understand him.

('72', 75, 4, 8, 132009) 111. CRITICISM ANSWERED
('72', 75, 5, 9, 132033) My article 1 on Congress Ministries has attracted attention and evoked criticism.
('72', 75, 5, 10, 132115) The latter demands an answer.
('72', 75, 5, 11, 132145) How can total prohibition be brought about immediately if at all?
('72', 75, 5, 12, 132211) By 'immediately' I mean an immediate planned declaration bringing about total prohibition not later than three years from 14th July 1937, the date of the taking of office by the first Congress Ministry.
('72', 75, 5, 13, 132414) I imagine that it is quite possible to bring it about in two years.
('72', 75, 5, 14, 132482) But not being aware of administrative difficulties I put down three years.
('72', 75, 5, 15, 132557) I count loss of this revenue as of no account whatsoever.
('72', 75, 5, 16, 132615) Prohibition will remain a far cry, if the Congress is to count the cost in a matter of first class national importance.
('72', 75, 5, 17, 132735) Let it be remembered that this drink and drugs revenue is a form of extremely degrading taxation.
('72', 75, 5, 18, 132833) All taxation to be healthy must return tenfold to the tax payer in the form of necessary services.
('72', 75, 5, 19, 132932) Excise makes people pay for their own corruption–moral, mental and physical.
('72', 75, 5, 20, 133009) If falls like a dead weight on those who are least able to bear it.
('72', 75, 5, 21, 133077) The revenue is largely derived, I believe, from industrial labour which together with field labour the Congress almost exclusively represents.
('72', 75, 5, 22, 133220) The loss of revenue is only apparent.
('72', 75, 5, 23, 133258) Removal of this degrading tax enables the drinkers, i.e., the tax payer to earn and spend better.
('72', 75, 5, 24, 133356) Apart, therefore, from the tremendous gain, it means a substantial economic gain to the nation.
('72', 75, 5, 25, 133452) I put this prohibition in the forefront because its result is immediate; Congressmen and especially women have bled for it; national prestige will rise in a manner it cannot by any single act that I can conceive, and the other five Provinces are highly likely to follow

('72', 76, 1, 2, 133805) the six.
('72', 76, 1, 3, 133814) The Mussalman non Congress Prime Ministers are equally interested in seeing India sober rather than drunk.
('72', 76, 1, 4, 133921) The cry of great expenditure in preventing illicit distillation is thoughtless where it is not hypocritical.
('72', 76, 1, 5, 134030) India is not America.
('72', 76, 1, 6, 134052) The American example is a hindrance rather than a help to us.
('72', 76, 1, 7, 134114) In America drinking carries no shame with it.
('72', 76, 1, 8, 134160) It is the fashion there to drink.
('72', 76, 1, 9, 134194) It reflects the greatest credit on the determined minority in America that by sheer force of its moral weight it was able to carry through the prohibition measure however shortlived it was.
('72', 76, 1, 10, 134384) I do not regard that experiment to have been a failure.
('72', 76, 1, 11, 134440) I do not despair of America once more returning to it with still greater fervour and better experience in dealing with it.
('72', 76, 1, 12, 134563) It may be that if India carries out prohibition it will hasten the advent of prohibition in America.
('72', 76, 1, 13, 134664) In no part of the world is prohibition as easy to carry out as in India for with us it is only a minority that drinks.
('72', 76, 1, 14, 134783) Drinking is generally considered disrespectable.
('72', 76, 1, 15, 134832) And there are millions, I believe, who have never known what drink is.
('72', 76, 1, 16, 134903) But why should prevention of illicit distillation cost any more than prevention of other crimes?
('72', 76, 1, 17, 135000) I should make illicit distillation heavily punishable and think no more about it.
('72', 76, 1, 18, 135082) Some of it will go on perhaps till doomsday as thieving will.
('72', 76, 1, 19, 135144) I would not set up a special agency to pry into illicit distilleries.
('72', 76, 1, 20, 135214) But I would punish anyone found drunk though not disorderly (in the legal sense) in streets or other public places with a substantial fine or alternatively with indeterminate imprisonment to end when the erring one has earned his or her keep.
('72', 76, 1, 21, 135457) This however, is the negative part.
('72', 76, 1, 22, 135493) Voluntary organizations especially manned by women will work in the labour areas.
('72', 76, 1, 23, 135575) They will visit those who are addicted to drink and try to wean them from the habit.
('72', 76, 1, 24, 135660) Employers of labour will be expected by law to provide cheap,healthy refreshment, reading and entertainment rooms where the working men can go and find shelter, knowledge, health giving food and drink and innocent fun.
('72', 76, 1, 25, 135879) Thus prohibition means a type of adult education of the nation and not merely a closing down of grog shops.
('72', 76, 1, 26, 135987) Prohibition should begin by preventing any new shop from being licensed and closing some that are in danger of becoming a nuisance to the public.
('72', 76, 1, 27, 136133) How far the latter is possible without having to pay heavy compensation I do not know.
('72', 76, 1, 28, 136220) In any case, generally, licences that lapse should not be renewed.
('72', 76, 1, 29, 136287) No new shops should be opened on any account.
('72', 76, 1, 30, 136333) Whatever immediately is possible in law
('72', 77, 0, 1, 136373) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 78
('72', 77, 1, 2, 136414) should be done without a moment's thought so far as the revenue is concerned.
('72', 77, 1, 3, 136492) But what is the meaning or extent of total prohibition?
('72', 77, 1, 4, 136548) Total prohibition is prohibition against sales of intoxicating drinks and drugs, except under medical prescription by a practitioner licensed for the purpose and to be purchasable only at Government depots maintained therefor.
('72', 77, 1, 5, 136775) Foreign liquors in prescribed quantity may be imported for the use of Europeans who cannot or will not do without their drink.
('72', 77, 1, 6, 136902) These will also be sold in bottles in select areas and under authorized certificates.
('72', 77, 1, 7, 136988) Hotels and restaurants will cease to sell intoxicating drinks.
('72', 77, 1, 8, 137051) But what about relief to the peasantry which is oppressed by excessive taxation, rack renting, illegal exactions, indebtedness which can never be fully discharged, illiteracy, superstition and disease, peculiarly due to pauperism?
('72', 77, 1, 9, 137282) Of course it comes first in terms of numbers and economic distress.
('72', 77, 1, 10, 137350) But the relief of the peasantry is an elaborate programme and does not admit of wholesale treatment.
('72', 77, 1, 11, 137451) And no Congress Ministry that does not handle this universal problem can exist for ten days.
('72', 77, 1, 12, 137544) Every Congressman is instinctively interested, if largely academically, in this problem.
('72', 77, 1, 13, 137633) He has inherited the legacy from the birth of the Congress.
('72', 77, 1, 14, 137693) The distress of the peasantry may be said to be the raison d'etre of the Congress.
('72', 77, 1, 15, 137776) There was and is no fear of this subject being neglected.
('72', 77, 1, 16, 137834) I fear the same cannot be said of prohibition.
('72', 77, 1, 17, 137881) It became an integral part of the Congress programme only in 1920. In my opinion, the Congress,, now that it is in power, will put itself morally right only by once for all courageously and drastically dealing with this devastating evil.
('72', 77, 1, 18, 138119) How to solve the problem of education is the problem unfortunately mixed up with the disapperance of the drink revenues.
('72', 77, 1, 19, 138240) No doubt there are ways and means of raising fresh taxation.
('72', 77, 1, 20, 138301) Professors Shah and Khambhatta have shown that even this poor country is capable of raising fresh taxation.
('72', 77, 1, 21, 138409) Riches have not yet been sufficiently taxed.
('72', 77, 1, 22, 138454) In this of all countries in the world possession of inordinate wealth by individuals should be held as a crime against Indian humanity.
('72', 77, 1, 23, 138590) Therefore the maximum limit of taxation of riches beyond a certain margin can never be reached.
('72', 77, 1, 24, 138686) In England, I understand, they have already gone as far as 70% of the earnings beyond a prescribed figure.
('72', 77, 1, 25, 138793) There is no reason why India should not go to a much higher figure.
('72', 77, 1, 26, 138861) Why should there not be death duties?
('72', 78, 0, 1, 138899) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY, 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 79
('72', 78, 1, 2, 138943) Those sons of millionaires who are of age and yet inherit their parents' wealth, are losers for the very inheritance.
('72', 78, 1, 3, 139061) The nation thus becomes a double loser.
('72', 78, 1, 4, 139101) For the inheritance should rightly belong to the nation.
('72', 78, 1, 5, 139158) And the nation loses again in that the full faculties of the heirs are not drawn out, being crushed under the load of riches.
('72', 78, 1, 6, 139284) That death duties cannot be imposed by provincial Governments does not affect my argument.
('72', 78, 1, 7, 139375) But as a nation we are so backward in education that we cannot hope to fulfil our obligations to the nation in this respect in a given time during this generation, if the programme is to depend on money.
('72', 78, 1, 8, 139579) I have therefore made bold, even at the risk of losing all reputation for constructive ability, to suggest that education should be self supporting.
('72', 78, 1, 9, 139728) By education I mean an all round drawing out of the best in child and man–body, mind and spirit.
('72', 78, 1, 10, 139825) Literacy is not the end of education nor even the beginning.
('72', 78, 1, 11, 139886) It is only one of the means whereby man and woman can be educated.
('72', 78, 1, 12, 139953) Literacy in itself is no education.
('72', 78, 1, 13, 139989) I would therefore begin the child's education by teaching it a useful handicraft and enabling it to produce from the moment it begins its training.
('72', 78, 1, 14, 140137) Thus every school can be made self supporting, the condition being that the State takes over the manufactures of these schools.
('72', 78, 1, 15, 140265) I hold that the highest development of the mind and the soul is possible under such a system of education.
('72', 78, 1, 16, 140372) Only every handicraft has to be taught not merely mechanically as is done today but scientifically, i.e., the child should know the why and the wherefore of every process.
('72', 78, 1, 17, 140544) I am not writing this without some confidence, because it has the backing of experience.
('72', 78, 1, 18, 140633) This method is being adopted more or less completely wherever spinning is being taught to workers.
('72', 78, 1, 19, 140732) I have myself taught sandal making and even spinning on these lines with good results.
('72', 78, 1, 20, 140819) This method does not exclude a knowledge of history and such general information by word of mouth.
('72', 78, 1, 21, 140918) One imparts ten times as much in this manner as by reading and writing.
('72', 78, 1, 22, 140990) The signs of the alphabet may be taught later when the pupil has learnt to distinguish wheat from chaff and when he has somewhat developed his or her tastes.
('72', 78, 1, 23, 141148) This is a revolutionary proposal but it saves immense labour and enables a student to acquire in one year what he may take much longer learn.
('72', 78, 1, 24, 141290) This means all round economy.
('72', 78, 1, 25, 141320) Of course the pupil learns mathematics whilst he is learning his handicraft.
('72', 79, 0, 1, 141397) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 80
('72', 79, 1, 2, 141438) I attach the greatest importance to primary education which according to my conception should be equal to the present matriculation less English.
('72', 79, 1, 3, 141584) If all the collegians were all of a sudden to forget their knowledge, the loss sustained by the sudden lapse of the memory of say a few lacs of collegians would be as nothing compared to the loss that the nation has sustained and is sustaining through the ocean of darkness that surrounds three hundred millions.
('72', 79, 1, 4, 141897) The measure of illiteracy is no adequate measure of the prevailing ignorance among the millions of villagers.
('72', 79, 1, 5, 142007) I would revolutionize college education and relate it to national necessities.
('72', 79, 1, 6, 142086) There would be degrees for mechanical and other engineers.
('72', 79, 1, 7, 142145) They would be attached to the different industries which should pay for the training of the graduates they need.
('72', 79, 1, 8, 142258) Thus the Tatas would be expected to run a college for training engineers under the supervision of the State, the mill associations would run among them a college for training graduates whom they need.
('72', 79, 1, 9, 142459) Similarly for the other industries that may be named.
('72', 79, 1, 10, 142513) Commerce will have its college.
('72', 79, 1, 11, 142545) There remain arts, medicine and agriculture.
('72', 79, 1, 12, 142590) Several private arts colleges are today self supporting.
('72', 79, 1, 13, 142647) The State would, therefore, cease to run its own.
('72', 79, 1, 14, 142697) Mecical colleges would be attached to certified hospitals.
('72', 79, 1, 15, 142756) As they are popular among monied men they may be expected by voluntary contributions to support medical colleges.
('72', 79, 1, 16, 142870) And agricultural colleges to be worthy of the name must be self supporting.
('72', 79, 1, 17, 142946) I have a painful experience of some agricultural graduates.
('72', 79, 1, 18, 143006) Their knowledge is superficial.
('72', 79, 1, 19, 143038) They lack practical experience.
('72', 79, 1, 20, 143070) But if they had their apprenticeship on farms which are self sustained and answer the requirements of the country, they would not have to gain experience after getting their degrees and at the expense of their employers.
('72', 79, 1, 21, 143291) This is not a fanciful picture.
('72', 79, 1, 22, 143323) If we would but shed our mental laziness, it would appear to be an eminently reasonable and practical solution of the problem of education that faces the Congress Ministers and therefore the Congress.
('72', 79, 1, 23, 143524) If the declarations recently made on behalf of the British Government mean what they sound to the ear, the Ministers have the organizing and organized ability of the Civil Service at their disposal to execute their policy.
('72', 79, 1, 24, 143747) The Services have learnt the art of reducing to practice the policies laid down for them even by capricious Governors and Viceroys.
('72', 79, 1, 25, 143879) Let the Ministers lay down a well conceived but determined policy, and let the Services redeem the promise made on their behalf and prove worthy of the salt they eat.
('72', 80, 0, 1, 144046) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY, 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 81
('72', 80, 1, 2, 144090) There remains the question of teachers.
('72', 80, 1, 3, 144130) I like Prof.
('72', 80, 1, 4, 144143) K.T. Shah's idea expressed in his article elsewhere of conscription being applied to men and women of learning.
('72', 80, 1, 5, 144255) 1 The may be conscripted to give a number of years, say, five, to the teaching for which they may be qualified, on a salary not exceeding their maintenance on a scale in keeping with the economic level of the country.
('72', 80, 1, 6, 144473) The very high salaries that the teachers and professors in the higher branches demand must go.
('72', 80, 1, 7, 144568) The village teacher has to be replaced by more competent ones.
('72', 80, 1, 8, 144631) My Suggestion to turn jails into reformatories to make them self supporting has not excited much criticism.
('72', 80, 1, 9, 144739) Only one remark I have noticed.
('72', 80, 1, 10, 144771) If they turn out marketable goods, I am told, they will unfairly compete with the open market.
('72', 80, 1, 11, 144866) There is no substance in the remark.
('72', 80, 1, 12, 144903) But I anticipated it in 1922 when I was a prisoner in Yeravda.
('72', 80, 1, 13, 144966) I discussed my plan with the then Home Member, the then Inspector General of Prisons, and two Superintendents who were in charge of the prison in succession.
('72', 80, 1, 14, 145124) Not one of them cavilled at my suggestion.
('72', 80, 1, 15, 145167) The then Home Member was even enthusiastic about it and wanted me to put my scheme in writing, if he could obtain the permission from the Governor.
('72', 80, 1, 16, 145315) But His Excellency would not hear of a prisoner making suggestions regarding jail administration!
('72', 80, 1, 17, 145413) And so my scheme never saw the light of day.
('72', 80, 1, 18, 145458) But the author believes in its soundness today just as much as when he first made it.
('72', 80, 1, 19, 145544) This was the plan: All industries that were not paying should be stopped.
('72', 80, 1, 20, 145618) All the jails should be turned into hand spinning and hand weaving institutions.
('72', 80, 1, 21, 145699) They should include (wherever possible) cotton growing to producing the finest cloth.
('72', 80, 1, 22, 145785) I suggest that almost every facility for this purpose already exists in the prison.
('72', 80, 1, 23, 145869) Only the will has to be there.
('72', 80, 1, 24, 145900) Prisoners must be treated as defectives, not criminals to be looked down upon.
('72', 80, 1, 25, 145979) Warders should cease to be terrors of the prisoners, but the jail officials should be their friends and instructors”.
('72', 80, 1, 26, 146097) The only one indispensable condition is that the State should buy all the khadi that may be turned out by the prisons at cost price.
('72', 80, 1, 27, 146230) And if there is a surplus, the public may get it at a trifling higher price to cover the expense of running a sales depot.
('72', 80, 1, 28, 146353) If my suggestion is adopted, the jails will be linked to the villages and they will spread to them the message of khadi and discharged prisoners may become model citizens of the State.

('72', 81, 1, 2, 146611) I am reminded that salt being a Central subject, the poor Ministers cannot do anything.
('72', 81, 1, 3, 146699) I should be painfully surprised if they cannot.
('72', 81, 1, 4, 146747) The Central Government has to operate in provincial territories.
('72', 81, 1, 5, 146812) Provincial Governments are bound to protect people within their jurisdiction against being dealt with unjustly even by the Centre.
('72', 81, 1, 6, 146943) And the Governors are bound to back the protests of their Ministers against unjust dealings with the people of their respective Provinces.
('72', 81, 1, 7, 147082) If the Ministers are on the alert, there should be no difficulty in the poor villagers helping themselves to the salt without undue interference on behalf of the Central authority.
('72', 81, 1, 8, 147263) I have no fear of such undue interference.
('72', 81, 1, 9, 147306) In conclusion, I should like to add that whatever I have said about prohibition, education and jails is presented merely for the consideration of Congress Ministers and the interested public.
('72', 81, 1, 10, 147498) I may not withhold from the public the views which–however strange, visionary or unpractical they may appear to critics–I have held tenaciously for long.

('72', 81, 4, 14, 147706) K.T. Shah was requested by me to offer his comments on my article 1 on Congress Ministries.

('72', 81, 6, 18, 147921) Shah had approved of Gandhiji's programme and had suggested measures to compensate the loss of revenue.
('72', 81, 6, 19, 148025) One of his suggestions was an appeal "to the Services for a voluntary surrender of their excess of salaries and allowances above a prescribed maximum".

('72', 82, 3, 4, 148273) MY DEAR KUMARAPPA, Your memorandum to the Ministers is good so far as it goes.
('72', 82, 4, 5, 148352) The article reads all right but Hindi is not up to the mark.
('72', 82, 4, 6, 148413) Whose is it?
('72', 82, 4, 7, 148426) Yes, register it.
('72', 82, 4, 8, 148444) I understand it costs nothing.

('72', 82, 9, 16, 148728) I would like you to examine Venilal Buch's demand on Navajivan Karyalaya and settle it.
('72', 82, 9, 17, 148816) I think for the sake of propriety you should get the consent of the trustees.
('72', 82, 9, 18, 148894) The best thing, therefore, would perhaps be that you yourself should call on Jivanji 2
('72', 82, 10, 19, 148981) and get his consent, so that I might be relieved of that burden.

('72', 83, 9, 10, 149525) Your attitude is most bewildering.
('72', 83, 9, 11, 149560) Before I issue my statement I make this offer.
('72', 83, 9, 12, 149607) I am prepared to go through the whole of your charges and if I feel convinced that you have been unjustly dealt with by the Sardar, I shall unhesitatingly say so and do everything humanly possible to undo the mischief.
('72', 83, 9, 13, 149826) If, on the other hand, I find against you and you are not satisfied with my findings, I shall request Bahadurji or Sir Govindrao Madgaonkar to go through the recorded evidence and review my findings.
('72', 83, 9, 14, 150026) All these proceedings need not be public so far as I am concerned.
('72', 83, 9, 15, 150093) If the findings are against you, you should have an opportunity of tendering an apology and making a full and frank confession of your weakness and the wrong done to the public, the Sardar and other colleagues.
('72', 83, 9, 16, 150304) But if you want the proceedings to be public, I do not mind.
('72', 83, 9, 17, 150365) You need not even know what is being done.
('72', 83, 9, 18, 150408) I had no desire to be in this affair at all.
('72', 83, 9, 19, 150453) But you wanted me to intercede.
('72', 83, 9, 20, 150485) Many friends, including Mr. Bharucha, have been pressing me to do likewise.
('72', 83, 9, 21, 150561) I may not now sit still.
('72', 83, 9, 22, 150586) I hope you will understand my anxiety to see that full justice is done to you and avoid everything that may possibly harm you without cause.
('72', 83, 9, 23, 150727) If you desire an enquiry by me, please send me your charge sheet and a precis of your evidence.
('72', 83, 9, 24, 150823) I would send it to the Sardar and any other colleagues against whom you have any grievance and after having had his and their reply, I shall call for such evidence as may be required, if any.
('72', 83, 9, 25, 151015) These proceedings need not take more than a week.
('72', 83, 9, 26, 151065) You need not concern yourself with what the Working

('72', 84, 5, 8, 151460) BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
('72', 84, 6, 9, 151478) Now I can send you a wire only tomorrow, is it not?
('72', 84, 6, 10, 151530) If possible Mahadev will send it [today].
('72', 84, 6, 11, 151572) I can’t issue my statement 2 immediately.
('72', 84, 6, 12, 151614) It will be issued only at the appropriate time.
('72', 84, 6, 13, 151662) Read my letter of yesterday.
('72', 84, 6, 14, 151691) I can’t decide whether it would be proper to
('72', 84, 7, 15, 151736) 1 On receiving this letter, Nariman sent a telegram to Gandhiji saying: “Strongly object publication one sided impression.
('72', 84, 7, 16, 151859) Desire to explain other side.
('72', 84, 7, 17, 151889) Letter follows.” In the letter which followed he said: “I find that in the last few letters you have been constantly threatening me with the publication of your conclusions.
('72', 84, 7, 18, 152063) Am I not entitled to know what you think before you make it public?
('72', 84, 7, 19, 152131) I am confident that I shall be able to satisfy you on all points and remove any misunderstanding if only I am given an opportunity to do so.
('72', 84, 7, 20, 152272) If, in spite of this request of mine, you decide to publish your views of this episode, I shall consider myself free also to give my explanation in public.
('72', 84, 7, 21, 152428) .” Even before he received this letter, Gandhiji informed Nariman on August 2 that he and Bahadurji were prepared to arbitrate on the two issues connected with the election of 1934 and the election of the leader of the Congress Party in the Bombay Legislature in 1937, and asked Nariman if this proposal was acceptable to him.
('72', 84, 7, 22, 152755) To this Nariman replied telegraphically on August 4: “Accept your and Bahadurji’s judgement on both issues.” On the 6th of August, however, Nariman asked Gandhiji’s help on a few points.
('72', 84, 7, 23, 152942) He suggested that lest his acceptance of this arbitral tribunal against a decision of the Working Committee might be interpreted to mean that he was disloyal to it, Gandhiji should obtain the approval of the Congress President to the proposed procedure.
('72', 84, 7, 24, 153196) He asked further that all his witnesses should be protected against harassment of any kind; without such an assurance, an independent enquiry and the task of ascertaining the truth would be rendered impossible.
('72', 84, 7, 25, 153407) For Gandhiji’s reply, vide “Letter to K. F. Nariman”, 8 8 1937; vide also “Statement to the Press”, 13 8 1937 2 On the Nariman controversy; vide “Statement to the Press”, 13 8 1937

('72', 89, 6, 8, 158661) August 3, 1937 I have very carefully gone through Jawaharlal Nehru’s essay 3 on the Hindi Urdu question.
('72', 89, 6, 9, 158766) The question has latterly become an unfor tunate controversy.
('72', 89, 6, 10, 158828) There is no valid reason for the ugly turn it has taken.
('72', 89, 6, 11, 158885) Be that as it may, Jawaharlal’s essay is a valuable contribution to a proper elucidation of the whole subject considered from the national and purely educational point of view.
('72', 89, 6, 12, 159062) His constructive suggestions, if they are widely accepted by persons concerned, should put an end to the controversy which has taken a communal turn.
('72', 89, 6, 13, 159212) The suggestions are exhaustive and eminently reasonable.

('72', 89, 9, 17, 159420) ON THE TRAIN, August 3, 1937
('72', 89, 10, 18, 159449) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL, I am writing this on the train taking us to Delhi.
('72', 89, 10, 19, 159520) Herewith is my Foreword or whatever it may be called.
('72', 89, 10, 20, 159574) I could not give you anything elaborate.
('72', 89, 10, 21, 159615) You have “perhaps” 5 before Pushtu and Punjabi.
('72', 89, 10, 22, 159663) I suggest your removing the adverb.
('72', 89, 10, 23, 159699) Khan Saheb for instance will never give up

('72', 89, 11, 25, 159975) 5 This was changed to read “to some extent”; vide “The Question Of Languages”, 21 8 1937.
('72', 90, 0, 1, 160065) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 91
('72', 90, 1, 2, 160108) Pushtu.
('72', 90, 1, 3, 160116) I believe it is written in some script, I forget which.
('72', 90, 1, 4, 160172) And Punjabi?
('72', 90, 1, 5, 160185) The Sikhs will die for Punjabi written in Gurmukhi.
('72', 90, 1, 6, 160237) There is no elegance about that script.
('72', 90, 1, 7, 160277) But I understand that it was specially invented like Sindhi to isolate the Sikhs from the other Hindus.
('72', 90, 1, 8, 160381) Whether such was the case or not, it seems to me impossible at present to persuade the Sikhs to give up Gurmukhi.
('72', 90, 1, 9, 160495) You have suggested a common script to be evolved out of the four Southern languages.
('72', 90, 1, 10, 160580) It seems to me to be as easy for them to substitute Devanagari as a mixture of the four.
('72', 90, 1, 11, 160669) From a practical standpoint, the four do not admit of an invented mixture.
('72', 90, 1, 12, 160744) I would, therefore, suggest your confining yourself to the general recommendation that wherever possible the provincial languages which have vital connection with Sanskrit, if they are not off shoots from it, should adopt revised Devanagari.
('72', 90, 1, 13, 160986) You may know that this propaganda is going on.
('72', 90, 1, 14, 161033) Then, if you think like me, you should not hesitate to express the hope that as Hindus and Muslims are one day bound to be one at heart, they will also, who speak Hindustani, adopt one script, i.
('72', 90, 1, 15, 161229) e., Devanagari, because of its being more scientific and being akin to the great provincial scripts of the languages descended from Sanskrit.
('72', 90, 1, 16, 161371) If you adopt my suggestions in part or in toto you will have no difficulty in laying your finger on the spots requiring the necessary changes.
('72', 90, 1, 17, 161514) I had intended to do so myself in order to save your time.
('72', 90, 1, 18, 161573) But I must not put that strain on my system just now.
('72', 90, 1, 19, 161627) I take it that my endorsement of your suggestions does not mean that I must ask the Hindi Sammelan to give up the use of the word Hindi.
('72', 90, 1, 20, 161764) I am sure, that cannot be your meaning.
('72', 90, 1, 21, 161804) I have taken it to the farthest limit possible as far as I can think.
('72', 90, 1, 22, 161874) If you cannot accept my suggestions, it would be better for the sake of accuracy to add the following sentence to the ‘Foreword’: ‘At any rate I have no hesitation in heartily endorsing them in a general way.’ I hope Indu’s 1 operation will go off well.

('72', 91, 8, 17, 163050) You say in your letter that you are prepared to get Manju married in another caste.
('72', 91, 8, 18, 163134) Is Manju also willing?
('72', 91, 8, 19, 163157) Would you accept an alliance if a suitable partner is available from any part of the country?
('72', 91, 8, 20, 163251) It is certainly necessary to do so.
('72', 91, 8, 21, 163287) The barriers ought to be broken.
('72', 91, 8, 22, 163320) When the whole country is ours, why should we keep ourselves confined to one community or province or region?
('72', 91, 8, 23, 163430) Pleasure should not be the end of marriage; there should be some sanctity about it and it should be entered into as a matter of dharma.
('72', 91, 8, 24, 163566) All other barriers should be disregarded.
('72', 91, 8, 25, 163608) It is difficult to say when Kusum will settle down to something steady.
('72', 91, 8, 26, 163680) She makes many plans but is not able to carry out any of them.
('72', 91, 8, 27, 163743) Guide her as much as you can.
('72', 91, 8, 28, 163773) By all means draw her there if you can.

('72', 92, 7, 12, 164387) NARANDAS, Anyone who knows all the processes from the [growing of] cotton to weaving should be able to write an introduction to the science of khadi 1 in two or at the most seven days.
('72', 92, 7, 13, 164572) 1. Cultivation of cotton, its varieties, yield of crops in the different regions and the use of each variety 2. Plucking, cleaning and ginning of cotton pods 3. Carding, preparation of slivers 4. Spinning 5. Weaving The booklet would give a description of the machines with illustrations, arithmetical calculations, improvements up to date, etc.
('72', 92, 7, 14, 164918) From among the persons whose names you suggest, Mahadev or Mirabehn are more likely to take up the work.
('72', 92, 7, 15, 165023) But nobody can surpass Rameshwari Devi 2. She is a woman of powerful personolity.
('72', 92, 7, 16, 165105) She knows excellent Hindi.
('72', 92, 7, 17, 165132) She has an insight into all our activities.
('72', 92, 7, 18, 165176) She belongs to well known families both on her husband’s and her father’s sides.
('72', 92, 7, 19, 165257) After you have availed yourself of her services in Rajkot, take her on a short tour of Kathiawar.
('72', 92, 7, 20, 165355) She will give considerable impetus to khadi and Harijan work.
('72', 92, 7, 21, 165417) I cannot send anyone better.
('72', 92, 7, 22, 165446) Still, if youwant me to make some other arrangement, I will do so.

('72', 93, 1, 4, 165781) She has a house in Delhi and also one in Lahore.
('72', 93, 1, 5, 165830) She is going to Delhi today and I also am going there for a day.
('72', 93, 1, 6, 165895) I have been invited by the Viceroy for an informal meeting.
('72', 93, 1, 7, 165955) It was she whom I had sent to Travancore for Harijan work.
('72', 93, 1, 8, 166014) You must have read in Harijan my article on education.
('72', 93, 1, 9, 166069) You have to demonstrate its practicability.
('72', 93, 1, 10, 166113) If you feel that your services can be utilized best in the primary department only, I don’t wish to shift you.
('72', 93, 1, 11, 166224) I shall be more than satisfied if you popularize khadi and uproot untouchability all over Kathiawar.
('72', 93, 1, 12, 166325) If you can achieve that, you will set an example to the whole country.
('72', 93, 1, 13, 166396) I have no plan for any work for you outside Kathiawar.
('72', 93, 1, 14, 166451) I had asked you just to make sure whether I could call you in case I needed somebody.
('72', 93, 1, 15, 166537) I feel better.
('72', 93, 1, 16, 166552) I need a little rest, which I am taking.
('72', 93, 1, 17, 166593) I am looking after Kanu 1. He is passing through a difficult stage.
('72', 93, 1, 18, 166661) At his age we also must have felt the same.
('72', 93, 1, 19, 166705) But he is an obedient boy and will, therefore, become steady by and by.
('72', 93, 1, 20, 166777) Most probably he will settle down with me in Segaon.
('72', 93, 1, 21, 166830) I am trying to adjust myself to him as far as possible.
('72', 93, 1, 22, 166886) Lilavati gave me your letter.
('72', 93, 1, 23, 166916) I for my part have permitted her, but I don’t think she will go.
('72', 93, 1, 24, 166981) She doesn’t wish to leave my side.
('72', 93, 1, 25, 167016) However, at times she does feel restless.

('72', 96, 3, 4, 170575) MY DEAR C. R., What nonsense!
('72', 96, 3, 5, 170605) Why should you feel sorry or disappointed because I hold certain views about salaries?
('72', 96, 3, 6, 170692) 1 I do not at all resent your not enforcing them.
('72', 96, 3, 7, 170742) I have said, my views need not be accepted if found unworkable.
('72', 96, 3, 8, 170806) We all marvel at the way you are managing things there.
('72', 96, 3, 9, 170862) You have approached your task with faith and religious zeal.
('72', 96, 3, 10, 170923) You must not feel the slightest disappointment.
('72', 96, 3, 11, 170971) You know my deepest feeling.
('72', 96, 3, 12, 171000) Then why should you worry?
('72', 96, 3, 13, 171027) I hope you will be able to spare yourself for 17th 2. My prayers and best wishes are with you always.
('72', 96, 3, 14, 171129) The talk with the Viceroy was formal though quite friendly.
('72', 96, 3, 15, 171189) Devdas was looking well.

('72', 96, 6, 21, 171371) I have already written about Kanti 4. I think it is better for you to come back as you have already stayed there for a month.

('72', 97, 1, 2, 172096) 135. ITS DEEPER MEANING
('72', 97, 2, 3, 172120) The thought world of khadi workers had undergone a revolu tion since the objective of khadi became the steady improvement of the artisans engaged in its production rather than its supply at as cheap rates as possible.
('72', 97, 2, 4, 172338) The fact that the increase in the wages has not much, if at all, affected the public has given a confidence to the workers which they had not when the policy was revolutionized.
('72', 97, 2, 5, 172516) The workers are beginning to realize that they have to touch every department of the lives of the artisans and try to bringabout an all round improvement in their lot.
('72', 97, 2, 6, 172684) Thus one reads with joy the following in the Maharashtra khadi Patrika noticed the other day in these columns: 1
('72', 97, 3, 7, 172797) In Korutala khadi workers are using the paper prepared by the local paper makers and are inducing local artisans to make twine from flax which is locally grown.
('72', 97, 3, 8, 172958) Many artisans have the bad habit of spitting fairly often just where they are sitting.
('72', 97, 3, 9, 173045) Eighty two such have been supplied with small earthen spittoons for use.
('72', 97, 3, 10, 173118) The manager of a zamindar in Metpally has been induced to stop begar.
('72', 97, 3, 11, 173188) In Tendur the weavers have been induced to adopt measures to prevent incurring debts.
('72', 97, 3, 12, 173274) Thus they have reduced marriage expenses to Rs. 30 as the maximum, stopped feasts at the time of the first shave, stopped drinking on ceremonial occasions, caste dinners on deaths.
('72', 97, 3, 13, 173455) Measures have been adopted to induce the womenfolk to use khadi saris (cheap patterns have been devised for the purpose), to save the increase in the artisans’ income against a rainy day.
('72', 97, 3, 14, 173643) In Savli a substantial rise has been given to those who will not incur debts and will card and spin one seer of not less than twenty counts of yarn of eighty per cent strength in one month.
('72', 97, 3, 15, 173833) Thus the following speaks for itself:
('72', 97, 4, 16, 173871) COUNT CURRENT RATE INCREASED RATE Rs. As.

('72', 98, 3, 6, 174383) 136. NOT A PRIZE
('72', 98, 4, 7, 174400) I have been receiving several letters from different provinces protesting against the exclusion of their or their friends’ names from ministerships and asking me to intervene.
('72', 98, 4, 8, 174576) I do not think there is a single province from which such complaints have not been received.
('72', 98, 4, 9, 174669) In some such letters dire results including communal riots have been threatened, if the excluded person’s claims are not considered.
('72', 98, 4, 10, 174802) In the first instance let me say that I have not intervened in any single case in the selection of ministers.
('72', 98, 4, 11, 174912) I have no right, having completely withdrawn from the Congress, to intervene in such matters, even if I had the wish which I have not.
('72', 98, 4, 12, 175047) My participation in Congress affairs is confined to tendering advice on the issues involved in office acceptance and on the policies to be pursued in the prosecution of our march to the goal of Complete Independence.
('72', 98, 4, 13, 175264) But it seems to me that my numerous correspondents who have been writing voluminously think that ministerships are prizes for past services and that certain Congressmen can demand their inclusion.
('72', 98, 4, 14, 175461) I venture to suggest to them that ministerships are avenues to service which those who are called to it should render cheerfully and to the best of their ability.
('72', 98, 4, 15, 175624) There can therefore never be a scramble for these offices.
('72', 98, 4, 16, 175683) It would be decidedly wrong to create ministerships for the sake of conciliating interests.
('72', 98, 4, 17, 175775) If I were a Prime Minister and I was pestered with such claims, I should tell my electors to choose another leader.
('72', 98, 4, 18, 175891) These offices have to be held lightly, not tightly.
('72', 98, 4, 19, 175943) They are or should be crowns of thorns never of renown.
('72', 98, 4, 20, 175999) Offices have been taken in order to see if they enable us to quicken the pace at which we are
('72', 99, 0, 1, 176093) 100 THE COOLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 99, 1, 2, 176135) moving towards our goal.
('72', 99, 1, 3, 176160) It would be tragic if self seekers or misguided zealots were allowed to impede the progress by imposing themselves on Prime Ministers.
('72', 99, 1, 4, 176295) If it was necessary to have assurances from those who have ultimately to clothe ministers with authority, it is doubly necessary to have assurances of understanding, of loyalty beyond suspicion and of willing obedience to discipline.
('72', 99, 1, 5, 176529) The grim fight in which the country is engaged cannot be won if Congressmen do not show in their conduct a sufficient measure of selflessness, discipline and faith in the means enunciated by the Congress for the attainment of the goal.
('72', 99, 1, 6, 176765) Thanks to the Karachi resolution 1, ministerships under the Congress aegis have no pecuniary attraction.
('72', 99, 1, 7, 176870) I must say in parenthesis that considering Rs. 500 as if it was the minimum instead of the maximum was a mistake.
('72', 99, 1, 8, 176984) Rs. 500 was the last limit.
('72', 99, 1, 9, 177012) Had we not got used to the excessive scale of salaries imposed upon the country, we would have regarded Rs. 500 to be excessive.
('72', 99, 1, 10, 177141) The Congress scale has been generally, for the past seventeen years at least, Rs. 75 per month.
('72', 99, 1, 11, 177237) In its three great constructive all India departments, national education, khadi and village industries, the authorized scale has been Rs. 75. These departments contain men who are good enough, so far as ability is concerned, any day to be ministers.
('72', 99, 1, 12, 177488) They have distingu ished educationists, lawyers, chemists and merchants, who if they were so minded, could easily command over Rs. 500 per month.
('72', 99, 1, 13, 177634) Why should the fact of becoming a minister make the great difference we see?
('72', 99, 1, 14, 177711) But the die is perhaps cast.
('72', 99, 1, 15, 177740) My remarks represent my personal opinion.
('72', 99, 1, 16, 177782) I have too high a regard for the Prime Ministers to question their judgment and wisdom.
('72', 99, 1, 17, 177870) No doubt they thought that this was the best in the circumstances facing them.
('72', 99, 1, 18, 177949) The point I wish to make, in answer to my correspondents, is that these offices have not been taken in view of the emoluments they offer.
('72', 99, 1, 19, 178087) And then they have to be given to those only in the party who are best able to discharge the duty to which they are called.
('72', 99, 1, 20, 178211) And, lastly, the acid test is that the choice must commend itself to the members of the party to whom the Prime Ministers owe their nomination.
('72', 99, 1, 21, 178355) No Prime Minister can for one moment impose a man or woman of his choice on the party.
('72', 99, 1, 22, 178442) He is Chief because he enjoys the full confidence of his party as to ability, knowledge of persons, and the other qualities that mark out one for leadership.

('72', 100, 2, 4, 178815) After describing the various activities conducted in Maganwadi, the Headquarters at Wardha, it ends: 1
('72', 100, 3, 5, 178918) There is a great deal of slackness on the part of members and agents in submitting their reports.
('72', 100, 3, 6, 179016) Members are reminded that according toour rules no report is received from a member for three consecutive quarters, his membership will lapse.
('72', 100, 3, 7, 179159) We regret to say that in accordance with this rule the membership of several has lapsed.
('72', 100, 3, 8, 179248) The reason for such slackness is probably that members think that it is not worthwhile reporting unless there is something noteworthy to mention.
('72', 100, 3, 9, 179394) Their work is in the nature of routine, and once they have reported they think that so long as they have not done anything new they need not report.
('72', 100, 3, 10, 179543) This again is a mistake.
('72', 100, 3, 11, 179568) It is quite essential for the proper working of the Association and for exchange of experiences through the medium of this bulletin that members and agents should carry on their work in close touch with the Central Office and keep it duly informed of their activities by means of full and regular reports.

('72', 100, 6, 14, 179911) It looks very much as if the whole of Malabar, the citadel of untouchability, is going to lead the way, as Travancore has done already, in the matter of temple entry.
('72', 100, 6, 15, 180078) I draw attention to the two brief statements 2 given below.
('72', 100, 6, 16, 180138) One is by the Cochin Temple entry Committee and the other by the Malabar Harijan Sevak Sangh, both promising an energetic propaganda organizing the so called savarna and so called avarna opinion in favour of opening all public temples to the avarnas precisely on the same terms as they are for the savarnas.
('72', 100, 6, 17, 180446) If there is an unimpeachable pronouncement of such opinion, no State nor trustees can long resist such opinion.
('72', 100, 6, 18, 180558) The Malabar Committee has rightly laid stress on the necessity of legislation removing all doubt as to the right of trustees to open to

('72', 102, 9, 11, 182416) SHRI DANI, I have your letter.
('72', 102, 9, 12, 182447) I have not received the report about the Bhangis.
('72', 102, 9, 13, 182497) But as soon as I get it I will go through it and write something if it calls for comment.
('72', 102, 10, 14, 182587) If the public life of Kathiawar is in a mess, it only means that the people are the same but the leaders are either useless or selfish or unprincipled or all this at the same time.
('72', 102, 10, 15, 182768) It is observed at some places that life continues as before in different spheres and some workers go on working away in silence without others knowing about it.
('72', 102, 10, 16, 182929) Are there any such workers in Kathiawar?
('72', 102, 10, 17, 182970) Try to find this out honestly and with a view to service.
('72', 102, 10, 18, 183028) Whether you do it as a member of the Sangh or as an individual, do it in a worthy manner.

('72', 102, 13, 21, 183184) A gathering of some workers of Kathiawar was held some time ago in Bhavnagar.
('72', 102, 13, 22, 183262) After a great deal of discussion, a resolution was passed, at the instance of Shri Nanabhai, that they should do social work under my guidance and be governed by the restrictions imposed by me.
('72', 102, 13, 23, 183456) Some of these gentlemen were to come to me to discuss the

('72', 103, 0, 1, 183541) 104 THE COOLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 103, 1, 2, 183583) matter.
('72', 103, 1, 3, 183591) On receiving their letter, I tried to prevent their coming by writing to them that their journey would perhaps be in vain as they would get from me advice only on what I regard as constructive work.
('72', 103, 1, 4, 183790) However, this failed to convince them and, Shri Jagjivandas, Balwan trai 1, Fulchand 2, Dhebarbhai 3 and Vajubhai 4 came over.
('72', 103, 1, 5, 183917) At the end of a discussion lasting two hours it was decided that I should write the substance of my advice in Harijanbandhu.
('72', 103, 1, 6, 184042) I agreed to comply with this request.
('72', 103, 1, 7, 184080) The first discussion was about the letter 5 I had written to Shri Dani.
('72', 103, 1, 8, 184152) I had been told that in that letter I had done grave injustice to the workers of Kathiawar by calling them useless, selfish, or unprincipled or all this at the same time.
('72', 103, 1, 9, 184323) In my reply I had stated that I was not in the habit of writing such crude letters and I asked for a copy of my letter.
('72', 103, 1, 10, 184443) In reply to this letter the above gentlemen came in person and produced the original letter 6, which runs as follows.
('72', 103, 1, 11, 184561) I said that those who took this letter to be censorious could be regarded as ignorant of Gujarati.
('72', 103, 1, 12, 184660) Its meaning is clear.
('72', 103, 1, 13, 184682) If public life in Kathiawar is actually in such a mess as described by Shri Dani, public servants must be guilty of one of the three or all the three shortcomings.
('72', 103, 1, 14, 184846) These gentlemen agreed that my letter could not be construed in any other way.
('72', 103, 1, 15, 184925) With reference to this they inquired whether anyone had sent me names of persons who had acted in a manner not befitting Kathiawaris?
('72', 103, 1, 16, 185059) I replied that I had published the names which had been sent to me and regarding whom I believed the allegations to be true.
('72', 103, 1, 17, 185184) The following points were then discussed: 1.Gandhiji to guide 2.[Kathiawar] Political Conference 3.The Prajamandal and the Conference 4.The restrictions and the injustices in the States 5.Organizing labour to improve their conditions 6.Constructive work like khadi, service of Harijans, etc.
('72', 103, 1, 18, 185476) 7.Whether these activities should be carried on indepen dently or under one organization.

('72', 104, 0, 1, 185686) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 105
('72', 104, 1, 2, 185730) Regarding my guidance, I declared that I could not shoulder the burden.
('72', 104, 1, 3, 185802) I have neither the capacity nor the inclination to guide anyone from a distance, hence they should write off my name.
('72', 104, 1, 4, 185920) If my advice is sought in a particular matter, I have always been giving it, and I regard it as my dharma to do so.
('72', 104, 1, 5, 186036) In my opinion, Kathiawaris should appoint a leader from amongst persons living there and, such a leader should be reappointed every year.
('72', 104, 1, 6, 186174) This would give them self confidence and make them self reliant.
('72', 104, 1, 7, 186239) The belief, whether true or otherwise, that Kathiawaris cannot accept for long any leader selected from amongst themselves, will also be dispelled.
('72', 104, 1, 8, 186387) While discussing other activities, I gave the opinion that if I had my way, I would engage everyone in khadi work, service of Harijans and village industries.
('72', 104, 1, 9, 186546) Even if everyone was to be engaged in this manner, many more workers would be needed than are at present available.
('72', 104, 1, 10, 186662) But those who do not find that kind of service congenial should select whatever field they preferred and put their heart and soul into it.
('72', 104, 1, 11, 186801) Having once made the choice one should not go on changing one’s field of work.
('72', 104, 1, 12, 186880) If a session of the Political Conference must be called, it should be called keeping in view the restrictions imposed by me in Bhavnagar and in accordance with the practice established in Porbandar.
('72', 104, 1, 13, 187079) It must not be held outside the boundaries of Indian States.
('72', 104, 1, 14, 187140) If permission is granted only in a single State it could be held there year after year.
('72', 104, 1, 15, 187228) It could be held in Amreli 1, but it would be preferable to hold it in a State in Kathiawar.
('72', 104, 1, 16, 187321) There should be a Prajamandal in each State.
('72', 104, 1, 17, 187366) Everyone should render to the best of his ability whatever service he can to these bodies.
('72', 104, 1, 18, 187457) Within the limits imposed by me, the Political Conference cannot freely discuss such questions as injustices practised in different States, etc.
('72', 104, 1, 19, 187602) This does not imply that these cannot bediscussed anywhere.
('72', 104, 1, 20, 187662) The people of a particular State may certainly discuss those questions, they should try and get justice in those particular matters, for it is their dharma to do so.
('72', 104, 1, 21, 187828) Thus, in whichever States restrictive orders are issued or injustices perpetrated, they could be freely discussed there.
('72', 104, 1, 22, 187949) Only truth and non violence should be the restraining principles in these cases.
('72', 104, 1, 23, 188030) Whatever is said should be hundred per cent true; it should be free from exaggeration and discourtesy.
('72', 104, 1, 24, 188133) We should not hold out threats about anything which we are not capable of doing.
('72', 104, 1, 25, 188214) We have to tolerate many things in this world because we are

('72', 105, 1, 2, 188385) powerless In order to improve its condition labour must get organized.
('72', 105, 1, 3, 188456) Everyone knows that I prefer the policy which has been adopted by Shrimati Anasuyabehn 1 in Ahmedabad.
('72', 105, 1, 4, 188559) I have not adopted the principle of organizing labour for political purposes.
('72', 105, 1, 5, 188637) They may take interest in politics as all citizens should.
('72', 105, 1, 6, 188696) But politics should not be the motive in forming an organization.
('72', 105, 1, 7, 188762) People should form organizations having regard to their vocations and their special circumstances.
('72', 105, 1, 8, 188861) We already have in the Congress an organization to deal with political issues and to train men for the work.
('72', 105, 1, 9, 188970) It has to protect the political rights of labourers in the same way as it has to protect those of others.
('72', 105, 1, 10, 189076) As a matter of fact, the political rights of labourers are not and should not be opposed to those of others.
('72', 105, 1, 11, 189185) This means that the work of the Congress safeguards [the interests of] and represents all.
('72', 105, 1, 12, 189276) It is my experience that if labour unions are politically motivated, there is an unnecessary rivalry between [political] workers, labourers become pawns in their game and, as a result, labourers have to suffer and the unions get a bad name.
('72', 105, 1, 13, 189517) Labour may also perhaps eye with suspicion those who come claiming to be their friends.
('72', 105, 1, 14, 189605) Those who form labour unions in order to improve their conditions should also be adept in the art of doing so.
('72', 105, 1, 15, 189716) If anyone without ability tries to form a union because he wants to, it cannot be done.
('72', 105, 1, 16, 189804) Amongst all these activities, I would give the highest place to khadi, eradication of untouchability, service of Harijans, village industries and prohibition.
('72', 105, 1, 17, 189963) If this cannot be done, I believe that other activities are not worthwhile.
('72', 105, 1, 18, 190039) The belief that constructive work can be carried on only if supported by other activities is, in my opinion, born out of ignorance.
('72', 105, 1, 19, 190171) It is my opinion that the strength that can be generated by firm and determined adherence to constructive activity is far superior to the strength gained by any other type of work.
('72', 105, 1, 20, 190352) I know that ordinarily no one is interested in these constructive activities.
('72', 105, 1, 21, 190430) I can think of two reasons for this.
('72', 105, 1, 22, 190467) One reason is that these activities bring one into contact with the villages.
('72', 105, 1, 23, 190545) Our workers have been brought up in cities, they have been educated in English schools and colleges, hence they have little interest in the life of rural people.
('72', 105, 1, 24, 190707) They do not regard themselves as fit only for living in villages and are ignorant of the art of mixing with the villagers.
('72', 105, 1, 25, 190830) The other reason is our idleness and the ignorance born of it.
('72', 105, 1, 26, 190893) Khadi and such other constructive work demand constant vigilance, effort, study and

('72', 106, 1, 2, 191044) diligence.
('72', 106, 1, 3, 191055) We are not prepared to render these; and later, when we cannot create interest in these great tasks, rather than blame ourselves we conclude that such work is dull.
('72', 106, 1, 4, 191220) I regard this as a serious shortcoming and have, therefore, come to the conclusion that so long as we do not do credit to these tasks, our other tasks will not be wholly successful.
('72', 106, 1, 5, 191402) And it is for this reason that, even after so many years, I give the utmost importance to these tasks.
('72', 106, 1, 6, 191505) Now the last question.
('72', 106, 1, 7, 191528) If all the activities are being managed by the same body, this may well continue.
('72', 106, 1, 8, 191610) I see no harm in each activity being carried on wholly independently.
('72', 106, 1, 9, 191680) Even if these are being carried on under the same authority, each should become self sufficient, and people should be allowed to be absorbed in the particular sphere which they have chosen.

('72', 106, 6, 14, 191973) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL, I forgot to cover one point in your letter referring to Mehe rally’s speech.
('72', 106, 6, 15, 192070) I mean Rajaji’s communique releasing the summer school prisoners.
('72', 106, 6, 16, 192136) I had read it before receiving your letter.
('72', 106, 6, 17, 192180) But it did not offend me.
('72', 106, 6, 18, 192206) I suppose because you approved of the action of the students of the summer school and I could not defend it any way whatsoever.
('72', 106, 6, 19, 192334) 1 I think that it was necessary to draw attention to the fact that the release did not mean approval of this breach or the offence which in law it was.
('72', 106, 6, 20, 192486) I fear that often when the Congress is in power it will use language which its predecessors have used and yet the motive behind will be different.
('72', 106, 6, 21, 192633) I hope you will have a nice time in Bombay over the operation.
('72', 106, 6, 22, 192696) You will wire when it is over.

('72', 107, 6, 11, 193383) There should be no delay.
('72', 107, 6, 12, 193409) Surely your evidence must be all ready.
('72', 107, 6, 13, 193449) Of course, I shall go into the allegations against you regarding the election of 1934. Have I not made that clear?

('72', 108, 2, 3, 194137) SEGAON, August 8, 1937
('72', 108, 3, 4, 194160) KANTI, I am not wrong in calling you a tyrant.
('72', 108, 3, 5, 194207) You were a tyrant to Amtul Salaam when you idolized her.
('72', 108, 3, 6, 194264) Now that that idolization has changed into a kind of repulsion, you are again being a tyrant to her.
('72', 108, 3, 7, 194365) Ramachandran had been pressing her—so were Paparamma and Saraswati—and he had sent a wire.
('72', 108, 3, 8, 194456) That is why she went.
('72', 108, 3, 9, 194478) She is having some peace there.
('72', 108, 3, 10, 194510) Now you wish that I should call her away from there.
('72', 108, 3, 11, 194563) I, therefore, wrote a letter 1 to her asking her to return and even sent a wire 2. I haven’t told her that it was at your instance that I asked her to come away.
('72', 108, 3, 12, 194725) I have given no reason at all.
('72', 108, 3, 13, 194756) If necessary, I will tell her when she comes.
('72', 108, 3, 14, 194802) I have not said all this to reproach you.
('72', 108, 3, 15, 194844) I have only drawn your attention to your proneness to extremes.
('72', 108, 3, 16, 194908) I have willingly called her back.
('72', 108, 3, 17, 194942) What about Saraswati?
('72', 108, 3, 18, 194964) She has been pleading to be permitted to come here.
('72', 108, 3, 19, 195016) Ramachandran wishes that she should not come for three years.
('72', 108, 3, 20, 195078) What do you yourself wish?
('72', 108, 3, 21, 195105) I am returning the statement of accounts.
('72', 108, 3, 22, 195147) It is excellent.

('72', 111, 3, 6, 198671) Public workers ought not to fall ill.

('72', 111, 9, 18, 199212) My personal opinion is that Committees should not be formed till there is provision in the Constitution for use of khadi.

('72', 112, 2, 3, 199564) SEGAON, WARDHA, August 10, 1937
('72', 112, 3, 4, 199596) CHHAGANLAL, I got your long letter.
('72', 112, 3, 5, 199632) I will see how the problem can be solved.
('72', 112, 3, 6, 199674) When we lack either time or space, we have to leave some things aside even though they may be important.
('72', 112, 3, 7, 199779) Please tell Vimu 1 that in her letter to me she was unwilling to promise 25,000 rounds in the spinning yajna and had asked my advice.
('72', 112, 3, 8, 199913) But in the printed list of names with me, I see 51,000 against her name.
('72', 112, 3, 9, 199986) Is 51 a misprint for 15?
('72', 112, 3, 10, 200011) If it is not, how did she get the courage to raise 25,000 to twice as much, or to treble the 17,000 which she had intended?
('72', 112, 3, 11, 200135) If she had the courage to do that, why couldn’t she quadruple 17,000 and make it 68,000?
('72', 112, 3, 12, 200224) If “scoffer friends” then looked upon her as an idolator, she should pay no attention to them.
('72', 112, 3, 13, 200319) On the contrary, she should welcome their blessings.
('72', 112, 3, 14, 200372) Spinning 68,000 rounds in 68 days would be no great achievement for a girl like Vimu.
('72', 112, 3, 15, 200458) According to the calculations here, 1000 rounds a day would require less than three hours, for the average speed is taken to be 400 rounds an hour.
('72', 112, 3, 16, 200606) Even if, however, the work takes four hours, I wouldn’t regard that as too strenuous for her.
('72', 112, 3, 17, 200700) Moreover, anyone who does this job with zest and enthusiasm would learn to get absorbed in the work on hand and automatically acquire the ability to do a great many other things.
('72', 112, 3, 18, 200879) Narandas is hesitating to undertake the preparation of the manual [of the science of khadi] though there is not the slightest reason for such hesitation.
('72', 112, 3, 19, 201033) If, however, you join him in preparing the booklet, I think it can immediately be done.
('72', 112, 3, 20, 201121) Anyone who has complete mastery of most of the processes will find it easy to give a methodical description of them and of the equipment required.
('72', 112, 3, 21, 201268) If you have not read any literature on the history of the subject, you should read it up.
('72', 112, 3, 22, 201358) If at least one booklet, covering all aspects of the subject, is brought out systematically, it would be easy to do further work in the field in future.
('72', 112, 3, 23, 201511) Think over this .

('72', 113, 1, 3, 201718) If you can plan a ten to fifteen days’ programme for Rameshwari Devi, counting from the day of her arrival, I think that would be more than enough.
('72', 113, 1, 4, 201866) You will be able to use her services to get a lot of Harijan and khadi work done.
('72', 113, 1, 5, 201948) She is a very capable, mature, thoughtful and experienced lady, and is full of noble aspirations.

('72', 113, 5, 10, 202175) SEGAON, WARDHA, August 10, 1937
('72', 113, 6, 11, 202207) NARANDAS, I got your letter.
('72', 113, 6, 12, 202236) There can be no cause at all for worrying about Kanaiyo.
('72', 113, 6, 13, 202293) What is necessary is to take care of him, to guide him, to understand the thousands of fancies that catch his mind, and to pacify him.
('72', 113, 6, 14, 202428) Besides this, nothing more is necessary, for his mind is not devious.
('72', 113, 6, 15, 202498) He is not secretive, doesn’t wish to conceal anything and has faith in those whom he regards as his elders.
('72', 113, 6, 16, 202606) It is, therefore, not at all difficult to guide him.
('72', 113, 6, 17, 202659) One thing, of course, is true.
('72', 113, 6, 18, 202690) If he is not given work which he can do and if nobody takes interest in him, he does feel lost.
('72', 113, 6, 19, 202786) At present I have heaps of work to do.
('72', 113, 6, 20, 202825) There is so much typing to be done that it leaves him exhausted and so many copies to be made that his fingers get cramps.
('72', 113, 6, 21, 202948) And this is apart from spinning.
('72', 113, 6, 22, 202981) I have also asked him to study Hindi and English, for which he has an expert teacher in Pyarelal.
('72', 113, 6, 23, 203079) He gets his fill listening to the sweet music of Nanavati and, as he does so, tries to pick up as much as he can.
('72', 113, 6, 24, 203193) Moreover all sorts of people visit me, from whom also he learns as much as he can.
('72', 113, 6, 25, 203276) He is therefore not likely to feel at any time that he is rusting without work or that nobody takes interest in him.
('72', 113, 6, 26, 203393) Please, therefore, have no worries on his account.
('72', 113, 6, 27, 203444) Till he himself wishes to go there, you or Jamna 1 should not tempt him.
('72', 113, 6, 28, 203517) There will be no difficulty then.
('72', 113, 6, 29, 203551) Lilavati, through her own thoughtlessness, is laid down with pain in the ribs.
('72', 113, 6, 30, 203630) I am dictating this letter reclining against her body as against a pillow.
('72', 113, 6, 31, 203705) She is listening and tells me that she neither desires

('72', 114, 1, 3, 203877) Please, therefore, forget her altogether for the present.
('72', 114, 1, 4, 203935) When she herself wishes to go there, I shall not stop her.
('72', 114, 1, 5, 203994) Narottam’s 1 death is as much a matter for rejoicing as for grief.
('72', 114, 1, 6, 204061) Such death would bring glory to any youth, for those who enter the jaws of death at such a tender age after having made holy resolutions are bound to attain bliss.
('72', 114, 1, 7, 204225) And even though dead, he lives through his example.
('72', 114, 1, 8, 204277) Read this to his father when you offer my condolences to him, and also congratulate him on having had such a son.
('72', 114, 1, 9, 204391) I have sent the article 2 sent by you for Harijanbandhu after some slight revision.
('72', 114, 1, 10, 204475) Read the letter to Chhaganlal and then pass it on to him.

('72', 114, 6, 15, 204666) August 10, 1937
('72', 114, 7, 16, 204682) NARANDAS, I got your letter.
('72', 114, 7, 17, 204711) If you find it impossible to write the Khadishastra Praveshika, you may give up the idea.
('72', 114, 7, 18, 204801) But the fact that your brain doesn’t work on this subject may perhaps be indicative of some deficiency in you.
('72', 114, 7, 19, 204912) I was not satisfied with the few lines that Jayantilal wrote.
('72', 114, 7, 20, 204974) I got the impression that he had forced himself to write.
('72', 114, 7, 21, 205032) The discussion with you doesn’t seem to have given him a new light.
('72', 114, 7, 22, 205100) That is, [he believes that] spinning and the other activities are conducted not as a means of intellectual development but only as training in crafts side by side with intellectual training.
('72', 114, 7, 23, 205291) I hope you understand the difference between the two.
('72', 114, 7, 24, 205345) If a carpenter teaches me his craft and I learn it mechanically, my hand will be able to use the carpenter’s tools but there will hardly be

('72', 115, 1, 2, 205739) any intellectual development.
('72', 115, 1, 3, 205769) If, however, an expert on carpentry teaches me the craft, my intellect also will develop fully in the process.
('72', 115, 1, 4, 205880) That is, I shall not only be a good carpenter but will also become an engineer, for while teaching me carpentry the teacher will have improved and embellished my language.
('72', 115, 1, 5, 206052) He will have taught me the history of wood and, while explaining where and how wood is grown, will have taught me geography.
('72', 115, 1, 6, 206177) He will also have taught me a little about agriculture and will have likewise taught me to make illustra tions of my tools.
('72', 115, 1, 7, 206301) While teaching me the economics of carpentry, he will have taught me arithmetic and geometry.
('72', 115, 1, 8, 206395) All this will make up a course of some seven years.
('72', 115, 1, 9, 206447) Maybe you do not link up spinning and the other crafts which you are teaching with intellectual development.
('72', 115, 1, 10, 206556) Perhaps you consider knowledge of the alphabet and reading as the only means of such development.
('72', 115, 1, 11, 206654) If this is not so, the writing of the Praveshika should be an easy job for you.
('72', 115, 1, 12, 206734) I know that I have not previously explained these thoughts in the manner in which I have explained them in this letter.
('72', 115, 1, 13, 206854) But I have been explaining in Harijan the ideas which are coming to me these days, and this idea is the first and foremost of them all.
('72', 115, 1, 14, 206990) I have hitherto also said that there should be training in crafts along with training of the intellect and that such training should occupy the primary place in a scheme of national education.
('72', 115, 1, 15, 207183) What I am now saying is that an important means of intellectual training should be craft training.
('72', 115, 1, 16, 207282) I feel that talents are being wasted and the fact that thousands of young people who leave schools are good for nothing except clerkships is indicative not of intellectual development but of intellectual waste.
('72', 115, 1, 17, 207493) True education is that which trains all the three abilities, spiritual, intellectual and economic, simultaneously.
('72', 115, 1, 18, 207608) No boy on leaving school should have to ask himself: “What shall I do now?” His education should be a kind of insurance guaranteeing him a livelihood.
('72', 115, 1, 19, 207759) I have dictated all this for you to think over.
('72', 115, 1, 20, 207807) If you have followed what I have said, you will have to examine the art of spinning from a new point of view and also devise a new method of teaching it.
('72', 115, 1, 21, 207961) Please read again from this point of view my recent articles 1 in Harijan.
('72', 115, 1, 22, 208036) Shankaran’s is a painful case.

('72', 118, 8, 17, 210830) Do please continue as one of the Trustees of the Harijan Ashram for the present.
('72', 118, 8, 18, 210911) Perhaps your effectiveness in begging will increase.
('72', 118, 8, 19, 210964) Is it not better that I should go on writing what seems right to me?
('72', 118, 8, 20, 211033) But how can I expect you to do more than what all of you can accept out of the suggestions I make?

('72', 119, 2, 3, 211481) SEGAON, August 11/12, 1937
('72', 119, 3, 4, 211508) It is understood that the discussions centred round land revenue and excise policies.
('72', 119, 3, 5, 211594) It was pointed out to Gandhiji that the policy of flat reduction in land revenue was undesirable, inasmuch as there were areas which had been heavily assessed and needed immediate help, while in some areas the land revenue was so low that it would not be advisable to reduce it any further.
('72', 119, 4, 6, 211885) As regards the excise policy, it is understood that Gandhiji impressed on the Ministers that in all the six Congress Provinces the policy in this matter should be uniform and total prohibition should be the goal of the Congress Ministries.
('72', 119, 4, 7, 212125) This goal should have to be achieved within the lifetimes of the present Ministries.
('72', 119, 4, 8, 212210) The loss in revenue would be made good by drastic retrenchments, and, if need be, the Congress Ministers should be prepared to face fresh taxation measures.

('72', 119, 7, 11, 212438) August 12, 1937 I have read what are described as startling disclosures of the Delhi interview in The Bombay Sentinel 3. It is from beginning to end a figment of imagination, pure and simple.
('72', 119, 7, 12, 212630) The interview, as stated in the Viceroy’s letter, was without any purpose beyond that of establishing courteous contact on his part.
('72', 119, 7, 13, 212763) Therefore, I studiously refrained from referring to any matter outside of lifting the ban on Khan Saheb’s entry into his own Province, and an understanding of Government’s wishes regarding my desire to visit that Province.
('72', 119, 7, 14, 212986) [The] other conversation was more or less of a general character.
('72', 119, 7, 15, 213052) The word ‘Federation’ was not even mentioned at the interview.

('72', 120, 3, 4, 213379) NARANDAS,
('72', 120, 4, 5, 213389) I got your letter.
('72', 120, 4, 6, 213408) Since I wrote to you only the day before yesterday, I have no special reason for writing this.
('72', 120, 4, 7, 213503) But there is one point.
('72', 120, 4, 8, 213527) You have written about Rs. 5 to 10 for Kamalabai.
('72', 120, 4, 9, 213577) Her request is for Rs. 5 only.
('72', 120, 4, 10, 213608) We have, therefore, to send only that much.
('72', 120, 4, 11, 213652) How to remit the sum is for you to decide.
('72', 120, 4, 12, 213695) No expense should be incurred in remitting it.
('72', 120, 4, 13, 213742) Jivanlal’s firm has an office in Madras too.
('72', 120, 4, 14, 213787) You can make an arrangement with them and pay the money in Rajkot.
('72', 120, 4, 15, 213854) If you cannot make such an arrangement, let me know.
('72', 120, 4, 16, 213907) Ask Kamalabai where the money should be remitted.
('72', 120, 4, 17, 213957) Kanaiyo has now settled down to work with me.
('72', 120, 4, 18, 214003) He says: “Now I am absolutely free from worry.” There is no need at all for you to worry about him.
('72', 120, 4, 19, 214103) Lilavati’s health will continue as it has been for some time.
('72', 120, 4, 20, 214165) It will come round by and by.
('72', 120, 4, 21, 214195) When was the last remittance on account of Mirabehn received?
('72', 120, 4, 22, 214257) There seems to have been some irregularity.

('72', 121, 6, 8, 215301) I do not work the Act, when I work so as to end it.

('72', 121, 10, 13, 215702) WARDHA, August 13, 1937 I have seen what seems to be a distorted version of the part I have played in the Nariman episode.
('72', 121, 10, 14, 215825) The virulent agitation that has gathered round it has caused me deep distress.
('72', 121, 10, 15, 215904) I cannot do better than quote from my letter, dated August 1, to Mr. Nariman: 3 Since that date, further correspondence between him and me has taken place.
('72', 121, 11, 16, 216060) 1 A communist labour leader, who had written “drawing Mr. Gandhi’s attention to the non release of all politicals and the necessity for labour legislation and the creation of deadlocks after some time.” 2 The letter appeared under the date line “Bombay, August 13” 3 The extract is not reproduced here; for the full text of the letter, vide “Letter to K.

('72', 122, 1, 2, 216472) telegram received from him today tells me that he will be ready with his evidence in both cases in five days.
('72', 122, 1, 3, 216582) I shall lose no time whatsoever in applying myself to the task I have undertaken.
('72', 122, 1, 4, 216664) I have not as yet worried Bahadurji in this matter, but if my findings are adverse to Mr. Nariman and he is not satisfied with them, I shall immediately request Bahadurji to review the evidence produced before me and my findings.
('72', 122, 1, 5, 216894) It has been suggested that what I have done now might have been done when the unfortunate controversy first burst forth.
('72', 122, 1, 6, 217015) I am not free at this stage to publish the whole of the correspondence that has taken place between him and me.
('72', 122, 1, 7, 217127) But I can say I have been always willing, as he has admitted himself, that he should have an independent inquiry if he desired it.
('72', 122, 1, 8, 217258) Therefore, whatever has taken place, has not been due to my indifference or unwillingness to help.
('72', 122, 1, 9, 217357) If I have been hitherto silent, my silence has been solely in the interest of Mr. Nariman as could be amply borne out by the correspondence referred to above.
('72', 122, 1, 10, 217516) I would appeal to the Bombay Press to stop the agitation altogether and ask the public to suspend judgment till the findings are in their possession.

('72', 122, 5, 14, 217756) BHAI VITHALDAS, I got your three letters.
('72', 122, 5, 15, 217798) I don’t remember Rajkumari to have made the criticism you mention regarding lace.
('72', 122, 5, 16, 217880) It is 4 a.
('72', 122, 5, 17, 217891) just now.
('72', 122, 5, 18, 217901) She is asleep.
('72', 122, 5, 19, 217916) I will ask her later.
('72', 122, 5, 20, 217938) Her complaint to me is always regarding the khadi section in the Panjab.
('72', 122, 5, 21, 218011) I have therefore received no complaint against your department.
('72', 122, 6, 22, 218075) 1 In Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, “Circular Letter”, 2 4 1897, Narahari Parikh explains: “on 14th of August, Shri Nariman requested Gandhiji, telegraphically, for permission to issue a statement in reply.
('72', 122, 6, 23, 218277) Gandhiji, of course, had no objection, though he advised against it in Nariman’s own interest.
('72', 122, 6, 24, 218372) Nariman, in a long letter dated August 15, expressed surprise that the demand for an apology to the Sardar and public, etc., from him should have been made by Gandhiji, for it seemed to him irrelevant and uncalled for.
('72', 122, 6, 25, 218591) He knew he had nothing to apologize for and no confession to make.”

('72', 123, 1, 2, 218701) I still feel that I did right in exempting Gosibehn 1. The case of this embroidery work is similar to our use of foreign thread for stitching clothes.
('72', 123, 1, 3, 218852) If she charges Rs. 2_ for an article made of khadi worth eight annas, the additional Rs. 2 are not spent on foreign thread but are paid to the women workers for their art.
('72', 123, 1, 4, 219024) It is for this reason that I have exempted Gosibehn.
('72', 123, 1, 5, 219077) This exemption does not in any way militate against the restrictions we have laid down, for as you admit we are still not able to supply exactly the same kind of thread that these women use.
('72', 123, 1, 6, 219268) I therefore feel that by refusing the exemption we would harm the cause of khadi.
('72', 123, 1, 7, 219350) We ought not to grudge the use of foreign things which harm nobody but, on the contrary, definitely benefit the country.
('72', 123, 1, 8, 219471) I don’t advise you to join the Swadeshi Store, but you may give such help as you can from outside.

('72', 125, 7, 12, 222054) Let me correct one opinion in it.

('72', 125, 7, 14, 222204) In the dictionary of a seeker of truth there is no such thing as being “not successful”.
('72', 125, 7, 15, 222293) He is or should be an irrepressible optimist because of his immovable faith in the ultimate victory of Truth which is God.

('72', 128, 2, 3, 225136) UNSEEMLINESS IS INDISCIPLINE The Daily Press reports that at the opening of the C. P. Assembly session the gallery which was packed to overflowing made an unseemly demonstration against Shri Raghavendra Rao 1. Those who packed the gallery were presumably Congressmen or those who sympathized with the Congress.
('72', 128, 2, 4, 225447) I suppose there will be parties even after we have Complete Independence of our make.
('72', 128, 2, 5, 225533) It will go hard with us if the parties will not tolerate one another or show towards one another ordinary courtesy.
('72', 128, 2, 6, 225649) And the Congress which claims to represent the whole nation can ill afford to be intolerant towards its political opponents or others.
('72', 128, 2, 7, 225784) If it is, and it is, the only all India body, it represents all interests.
('72', 128, 2, 8, 225859) It represents even Shri Raghavendra Rao who was at one time a respected member of the Congress organization.
('72', 128, 2, 9, 225968) It may be that the votes in the constituency for which he stood were tampered with.
('72', 128, 2, 10, 226052) If they were, the law would look after it.
('72', 128, 2, 11, 226095) But he must be presumed to be honest till he is proved guilty.
('72', 128, 2, 12, 226158) And even if he is proved guilty, the guilt will be no warrant for unseemly demonstration against him.
('72', 128, 2, 13, 226260) Intolerance, discourtesy, harshness are not only against Congress discipline and code of honour, they are taboo in all good society and are surely contrary to the spirit of democracy.

('72', 128, 5, 16, 226494) A friend writes: 2
('72', 128, 6, 17, 226513) The following sentence in your article 3 “Criticism Answered” (31st July) seems to me to offend against the spirit of truth and non violence as also against good logic.
('72', 128, 7, 18, 226682) “Foreign liquors in prescribed quantity may be imported for the use of Europeans who cannot or will not do without their drink.”
('72', 128, 8, 19, 226811) The Congress Govemments must feel as much concerned for the welfare of the European community within their provinces as for the Indian

('72', 129, 1, 2, 227097) communities.
('72', 129, 1, 3, 227110) I assume that the Congressmen, as prohibitionists, are agreed that drink is as bad for the European as for the Indian.
('72', 129, 1, 4, 227229) In that case the mere whim of the drinker cannot count.
('72', 129, 1, 5, 227285) If drink is to be allowed to the European— although it is bad for him—because he “cannot or will not do without it”, the Japanese, the Americans and several other foreigners in India may seek the same permission; and if they are to be allowed to continue their evil habit on that ground, why should an Indian in his own country be not allowed to ruin himself in the same way?.
('72', 129, 2, 6, 227662) If anyone is to be permitted to take (not take to) alcohol, it must be entirely on medical or some other universally applicable ground.
('72', 129, 2, 7, 227798) There cannot be under the Congress regime a discriminatory legislation for or against a community.
('72', 129, 3, 8, 227897) A foreigner residing in India for a period only ought not to be exempt
('72', 129, 4, 9, 227968) from the same obligation.
('72', 129, 4, 10, 227994) Thus, even for those who feel that total abstinence
('72', 129, 5, 11, 228046) is not absolutely necessary, it must be obligatory to give up drink during their
('72', 129, 6, 12, 228127) stay in India if the nation has declared itself against it.
('72', 129, 6, 13, 228187) They must be deemed to
('72', 129, 7, 14, 228210) reside in India on the understanding that they will respect the laws, customs
('72', 129, 8, 15, 228288) and rules of decent conduct of the people amongst whom they have come to
('72', 129, 9, 16, 228361) reside.
('72', 129, 9, 17, 228369) I have no difficulty generally in following and often adopting this writer’s criticism.
('72', 129, 9, 18, 228457) But I must confess that though I have read the letter three times, I have failed to understand the argument.
('72', 129, 9, 19, 228566) Why is the proposed exemption against the spirit of ahimsa or truth?
('72', 129, 9, 20, 228635) I fail to see even the bad logic the writer sees in it.
('72', 129, 9, 21, 228691) In dealing with living entities, the dry syllogistic method leads not only to bad logic but sometimes to fatal logic.
('72', 129, 9, 22, 228809) For if you miss even a tiny factor— and you never have control over all the factors that enter into dealings with human beings—your conclusion is likely to be wrong.
('72', 129, 9, 23, 228975) Therefore you never reach the final truth, you only reach an approximation, and that too if you are extra careful in your dealings.
('72', 129, 9, 24, 229107) Indeed it was my regard for ahimsa and truth that made me think of exempting Europeans.
('72', 129, 9, 25, 229195) For I am unable to lay down a universal law for all human beings and for all climes that drink is an evil.
('72', 129, 9, 26, 229302) I can well regard it as a necessity in the frigid zone.
('72', 129, 9, 27, 229358) I would therefore be chary of imposing prohibition against Europeans who not only do not regard measured quantities of alcohol at each meal an evil but consider it a necessity.
('72', 129, 9, 28, 229535) Drink is not regarded as a vice in European society as it is generally in India.
('72', 129, 9, 29, 229616) I would therefore, even from the point of view of courtesy (a phase of ahimsa), leave it to their honour to respect the usage of the
('72', 130, 0, 1, 229749) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 131
('72', 130, 1, 2, 229793) country of their adoption.
('72', 130, 1, 3, 229820) I would gladly accept the logic of allowing other nationals, if the necessity is proved, the modified freedom the Europeans will enjoy.
('72', 130, 1, 4, 229956) Indeed it might be necessary to bring in a large number of Indians too under the medical certificate clause.
('72', 130, 1, 5, 230065) For me the drink question is one of dealing with a growing social evil against which the State is bound to provide whilst it has got the opportunity.
('72', 130, 1, 6, 230215) The aim is patent.
('72', 130, 1, 7, 230234) We want to wean the labouring population and the Harijans from the curse.
('72', 130, 1, 8, 230308) It is a gigantic problem, and the best resources of all social workers, especially women, will be taxed to the utmost before the drink habit goes.
('72', 130, 1, 9, 230455) The prohibition I have adumbrated is but the beginning (undoubtedly indispensable) of the reform.
('72', 130, 1, 10, 230553) We cannot reach the drinker so long as he has the drink shop near his door to tempt him.
('72', 130, 1, 11, 230642) One might not as well prevent an ailing child, nay man, from touching sweets so long as he does not remove the open box in front of them.
('72', 130, 1, 12, 230780) Whilst on this question, I would like to answer an argument advanced in one of the newspaper cuttings which good friends send me that Shri C. Rajagopalachari in his zeal for this reform has brushed aside the question of the unemployment of the tappers who will be thrown out of work.
('72', 130, 1, 13, 231064) I do not know what he has in mindfor them.
('72', 130, 1, 14, 231107) Shri Gajanan, who is becoming an expert in making palm gur 1, tells me that in the Southern Presidency there are tappers engaged in the nefarious trade.
('72', 130, 1, 15, 231260) He further suggests that the tapping need not stop at all.
('72', 130, 1, 16, 231319) Only what they will tap under the prohibition regime will be sweet toddy which will be converted into gur instead of fiery liquid.
('72', 130, 1, 17, 231450) Indeed I learn that in Andhradesh the tappers do not sell the palm juice they extract, but they convert it into gur which they sell to the arrack manufacturers who make arrack out of this gur.
('72', 130, 1, 18, 231643) In such cases nothing need be done except for the State to take over this gur at a reasonable agreed price.
('72', 130, 1, 19, 231751) From what I know of the tappers, they are not likely to lose anything by the impending prohibition, and the poor will get a rich but cheap food in the shape of good pure gur instead of a liquid which harms both body and soul.

('72', 131, 8, 13, 232612) I feel—and I should feel—hesitant to write about my own birthday.
('72', 131, 8, 14, 232678) Readers should know that I would have forgotten it altogether if people in India had not kept reminding me of it.
('72', 131, 8, 15, 232792) I had to recollect my date of birth only on my joining the school and again when I went to become a barrister.
('72', 131, 8, 16, 232903) However, I do not recall my parents having customarily celebrated either my birthday or that of any of my brothers.
('72', 131, 8, 17, 233019) I have not celebrated the birthday of my parents or my sons.
('72', 131, 8, 18, 233080) At one time, I used to keep a record of their birthdays but even that record was lost when like the [proverbial] cat we changed houses more than seven times.
('72', 131, 8, 19, 233238) I do not know why I have never been interested in birthdays.
('72', 131, 8, 20, 233299) But ever since my birthday was first celebrated with pomp in India, I made it known as Rentia Baras.
('72', 131, 8, 21, 233400) With reference to this occasion which is to be celebrated this year also by the National School of Rajkot, Shri Chhaganlal Joshi writes as follows: 2 If all Kathiawaris, whether living in Kathiawar or outside, do their part, the amount of Rs. 15,000, which Shri Chhaganlal expects to raise, is a

('72', 131, 9, 23, 233761) The correspondent had requested Gandhiji to write in Hanjanbandhu about Narandas Gandhi’s scheme to celebrate Rentia Baras.
('72', 132, 0, 1, 233885) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 133
('72', 132, 1, 2, 233929) very small sum in my opinion.
('72', 132, 1, 3, 233959) I would regard no amount big enough where khadi propaganda and Harijan work are concerned.
('72', 132, 1, 4, 234050) Propag ation of khadi means a clear increase in national wealth.
('72', 132, 1, 5, 234115) With an insignificant capital, the Spinners’ Association has to date distributed three crore rupees amongst the poor, that is to say that khadi worth a minimum of rupees four crores was produced and, of these three crores found their way to the villages.
('72', 132, 1, 6, 234370) Similarly, Harijan service should also be regarded as charity which earns immediate merit for the donor, as it is a form of atonement.
('72', 132, 1, 7, 234505) And charity thus given yields immeasurable fruit.
('72', 132, 1, 8, 234555) Those who are aware of this will contribute to the Daridranarayana fund not in a miserly fashion but in handfuls.
('72', 132, 1, 9, 234669) But why in the National School at Rajkot alone and why not elsewhere?
('72', 132, 1, 10, 234739) This should be regarded as a relevant question.
('72', 132, 1, 11, 234787) I can only say that the scheme drawn up by Shri Narandas Gandhi to celebrate this occasion strikes me as unique.
('72', 132, 1, 12, 234900) Whatever is collected by means of it is managed by a prosperous organization.
('72', 132, 1, 13, 234978) It has been found that the routine programme which has been in operation for three years has been steadily expanding.
('72', 132, 1, 14, 235096) Hence, I can unreservedly request devotees of khadi and Harijans to contribute their utmost to this fund.
('72', 132, 1, 15, 235202) Those who contribute to this fund should realize that persons contributing to the yajna in the form of yarn are certainly giving more than those who pay money, as the former pay with wealth produced by their own labour.
('72', 132, 1, 16, 235422) Those who give money only transfer it to the charity box, they do not produce new wealth, though of course they help to produce more.

('72', 135, 3, 5, 238528) Kanu has typed the Hindi one.
('72', 135, 3, 6, 238558) The other is getting ready.
('72', 135, 3, 7, 238586) You seem to be very sensitive indeed.
('72', 135, 3, 8, 238624) I only described to you what I saw.
('72', 135, 3, 9, 238660) What happened yesterday was worth seeing.
('72', 135, 3, 10, 238702) How could I possibly be displeased by your remaining present?
('72', 135, 3, 11, 238764) But I sensed the atmosphere.
('72', 135, 3, 12, 238793) You did quite right of course in not coming yesterday.
('72', 135, 3, 13, 238848) More when we meet.

('72', 135, 9, 18, 238991) MRIDULA, Three of your letters are lying with me.
('72', 135, 9, 19, 239041) Since you were not in any hurry I have taken my time answering them.
('72', 135, 9, 20, 239110) I did right, didn’t I?
('72', 135, 9, 21, 239133) You ask me to write to the Majoor Mahajan, but I do not see the need.
('72', 135, 9, 22, 239203) You did well to write again.
('72', 135, 9, 23, 239232) You have not mentioned anything in your second letter about the legal proceedings against you.
('72', 135, 9, 24, 239327) Who is Premlila Mehta?
('72', 135, 9, 25, 239350) In my view such writings are calculated to rouse sexual passion.
('72', 135, 9, 26, 239415) But how can they be stopped?
('72', 135, 9, 27, 239444) Such is today’s education.
('72', 135, 9, 28, 239471) That is how lives are shaped.
('72', 135, 9, 29, 239501) The Vikas Griha seems to be developing well.
('72', 135, 9, 30, 239546) Now your second letter.
('72', 135, 9, 31, 239570) There must be laws about women.
('72', 135, 9, 32, 239602) Do write to Bhulabhai 1. It must also be investigated whether or not some laws can be made in the provinces.
('72', 135, 9, 33, 239711) There is little hope that anyone in the Assembly would study the question.
('72', 135, 9, 34, 239786) If a good lawyer having some free time studies this problem and frames the Bill, then an agitation can be started on that basis.
('72', 135, 9, 35, 239915) We shall discuss this when you come here.
('72', 135, 9, 36, 239957) How much can be written in a letter ?
('72', 135, 9, 37, 239995) Prabha is plunged in a sea of sorrow.
('72', 135, 9, 38, 240033) She lost her father in law and now she has gone to nurse her father.
('72', 135, 9, 39, 240102) She has to act on other people’s orders.

('72', 136, 7, 12, 240587) You must have received my wire allowing you to remain there as long as necessary.
('72', 136, 7, 13, 240669) It will be a great thing for me if you get well.
('72', 136, 7, 14, 240718) My consideration was only on behalf of Amtul Masood and Mother.
('72', 136, 7, 15, 240782) As for the rest, what I wrote to Ramachandran should hold good.
('72', 136, 7, 16, 240846) You should return only when he permits.
('72', 136, 7, 17, 240886) Mirabehn arrived yesterday.
('72', 136, 7, 18, 240914) She has not gained much in health.
('72', 136, 7, 19, 240949) Kanti writes that he will have nothing to do with you as long as you are attached to him.
('72', 136, 7, 20, 241039) And when you have become disinterested there will be no problem at all.
('72', 136, 7, 21, 241111) I have one more letter from you today.
('72', 136, 7, 22, 241150) You need not be in a hurry to return.

('72', 137, 14, 21, 242097) 2 ibid 3 On July 24, 1937, about 225 political prisoners in the Andamans Central Prison had gone on hunger strike.
('72', 137, 14, 22, 242212) One of their demands was general release of all political prisoners and repeal of all repressive laws.
('72', 137, 14, 23, 242315) But the Government of India had decided not to consider any of their demands unless they gave up the strike.

('72', 138, 3, 4, 242620) DEAR SAMPURNANAND, I had assumed that you were always in good health and physically robust.
('72', 138, 3, 5, 242712) Narendra Dev is very ill, Jayaprakash is so so and you are suffering from jaundice and palpitation.
('72', 138, 3, 6, 242812) In Gujarat, Dinkar is perpetually ill.
('72', 138, 3, 7, 242851) Meherally 1 has of course always been weak.
('72', 138, 3, 8, 242895) I do not know about Masani’s 2 condition.
('72', 138, 3, 9, 242937) I really feel that I should open a nature cure clinic for persons like you, and give up all other work.
('72', 138, 3, 10, 243041) You surely know that I am a nature cure fiend.
('72', 138, 3, 11, 243088) Hence you should get well if only to avoid provoking the madness in me.
('72', 138, 3, 12, 243160) Your letter throws ample light on my question.
('72', 138, 3, 13, 243207) 3 Nothing further remains to be asked.
('72', 138, 3, 14, 243246) But the letter raises many other questions, which we shall talk over when we meet.
('72', 138, 3, 15, 243329) However, let me say one thing.
('72', 138, 3, 16, 243360) It does not seem correct to say that we can never approach our objective by means of compromise.
('72', 138, 3, 17, 243457) Of course, the reason for compromise should not be our weakness.
('72', 138, 3, 18, 243522) Do write the other book you have in mind.
('72', 138, 3, 19, 243564) I for one like your style.

('72', 139, 1, 3, 244244) The stand I took in Lancashire during the Round Table Conference 1 still holds good, for I cannot see any economic agreement independent of political issues.
('72', 139, 1, 4, 244402) The fact that you people are members of the Pact Committee only means that you no longer have the right to raise political issues.
('72', 139, 1, 5, 244533) Hence treating this issue as totally independent you must concentrate only on its own merits or otherwise.
('72', 139, 1, 6, 244640) And what can I say about either?
('72', 139, 1, 7, 244673) My opinion would most probably coincide with yours.
('72', 139, 1, 8, 244725) Moreover, I believe that it is your duty to adopt this course.
('72', 139, 1, 9, 244788) If necessary, you may say that in spite of that being your opinion on the merits and demerits, it need not be given much weight.
('72', 139, 1, 10, 244917) Since the Congress is the only popular institution, it is necessary that whatever agreement is reached should have the seal of the Congress.
('72', 139, 1, 11, 245058) And that agreement should be considered binding.
('72', 139, 1, 12, 245107) This would prove your integrity and sense of justice.

('72', 140, 8, 17, 246902) I have also remonstrated 3 a bit with him.
('72', 140, 8, 18, 246945) There is no dharma in working like this.
('72', 140, 8, 19, 246986) In fact I consider it a fault.

('72', 141, 2, 3, 247672) WARDHA, August 20, 1937 Mr. K. F. Nariman has sent me a statement containing his case against Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and others.
('72', 141, 2, 4, 247803) In it he wants me to invite witnesses and give them certain assurances.
('72', 141, 2, 5, 247875) 1 This I gladly do hereby.
('72', 141, 2, 6, 247902) I would like all those members of the Assembly and the Council who took part in the election of the leader for the Congress Party and those who were influencing votes to send me their statements of what they know, especially whether they voted in the manner they did at the instigation of Sardar Vallabhbhai directly or indirectly, and also their reasons for voting.
('72', 141, 2, 7, 248269) It is said that the election being unanimous there was no voting.
('72', 141, 2, 8, 248335) Even so, I would like members who were present at the election to write to me, if they will, as to why they did not express their dissent.
('72', 141, 2, 9, 248474) I would also like those who took part in influencing the decisions of the electors to write to me whether they acted at the instigation or advice of the Sardar and whether, as a matter of fact, they used his name in speaking to the electors and, if they did, whether they did so with his knowledge and consent.
('72', 141, 2, 10, 248785) There is another class of witnesses as to the part Mr. Nariman played in 1934 at the election of members from Bombay for the Central Assembly.
('72', 141, 2, 11, 248928) I would ask those who can to throw light on the charge of betrayal of trust or improper conduct brought against Mr. Nariman.
('72', 141, 2, 12, 249053) It has been stated to me that the truth might be stifled for fear of victimization by the Sardar.
('72', 141, 2, 13, 249151) I do not visualize how the Sardar can victimize.
('72', 141, 2, 14, 249200) But I can give this assurance that in the event of the Sardar being found guilty of such conduct I should cut off the intimate contact I enjoy with him.
('72', 141, 2, 15, 249353) If there are witnesses who wish to write to me in confidence I shall respect their confidence, but they should know that if their statements are such as need corroboration or

('72', 141, 3, 17, 249596) issued a statement on the 17th of August.
('72', 141, 3, 18, 249638) In this he stated that he was not prepared to apologize and that an assurance of protection should be given to all the witnesses.
('72', 141, 3, 19, 249768) He followed up the public statement by a letter to Gandhiji urging that as the President of the Parliamentary Committee, Sardar Patel enjoyed large and arbitrary powers and many witnesses who were members of the Legislature were afraid of incurring his displeasure.
('72', 141, 3, 20, 250034) It was essential, therefore, and in the interest of truth, that assurance of complete protection should be given to the witnesses.”

('72', 142, 1, 4, 250598) The statements should be written in clear hand without argument or embellishment and should be relevant to matters referred to by me.

('72', 142, 9, 17, 251200) ANNA, I have your letter.
('72', 142, 9, 18, 251226) There was no need for you to feel sorry.
('72', 142, 9, 19, 251267) It was imperative to give expression to the shock I received at the station.
('72', 142, 9, 20, 251344) It would have been betrayal of friendship if I had not done so.
('72', 142, 9, 21, 251408) Had I entertained suspicion before this I would have dealt with it.
('72', 142, 9, 22, 251476) When you had intended to leave after obtaining my permission you ought to have handed over charge to somebody.
('72', 142, 9, 23, 251587) No calamity would have befallen if I had not given permission.
('72', 142, 9, 24, 251650) This is evident as you saw how it affected me and what I had to do suddenly since you did not hand over charge.
('72', 142, 9, 25, 251762) And that too as soon as I got down at the station.

('72', 143, 9, 13, 252379) Among them I find your letter too.
('72', 143, 9, 14, 252414) I am not quite sure if I have replied to this letter.
('72', 143, 9, 15, 252468) Tara is a cheat.
('72', 143, 9, 16, 252485) She is also somewhat lazy.
('72', 143, 9, 17, 252512) Once in a while she writes to me, even makes promises and subsequently forgets everything, Congratulation’s on Virendra having started wearing khadi.
('72', 143, 9, 18, 252662) If you live carefully and work within the limits of your capacity, your health will be all right.
('72', 143, 9, 19, 252760) It is of course good that Tara is studying again.
('72', 143, 9, 20, 252810) There is no reason for being disheartened if one has failed.
('72', 143, 9, 21, 252871) Students study to acquire knowledge, not for passing examination.
('72', 143, 9, 22, 252937) Examinations are a kind of measuring rod.
('72', 143, 9, 23, 252979) When students fail, they study more and increase their knowledge.

('72', 144, 2, 3, 253256) [Before August 21, 1937]
('72', 144, 3, 4, 253281) GANDHIJI: The cruellest irony of the new reforms lies in the fact that we are left with nothing but the liquor revenue to fall back upon in order to give our children education.
('72', 144, 3, 5, 253459) That is the educational puzzle but it should not baffle us.
('72', 144, 3, 6, 253519) We have to solve it and the solution must not involve the compromise of our ideal of prohibition, cost whatever else it may.
('72', 144, 3, 7, 253644) It must be shameful and humiliating to think that unless we got the drink revenue, our children would be starved of their education.
('72', 144, 3, 8, 253777) But if it comes to it, we should prefer it as a lesser evil.
('72', 144, 3, 9, 253838) If only we will refuse to be obsessed by the figures and by the supposed necessity of giving our children the exact kind of education that they get today, the problem should not baffle us.
('72', 144, 4, 10, 254027) QUESTION: Then would you really abolish what is called secondary education and give the whole education up to matriculation in the village schools?
('72', 144, 5, 11, 254175) A. Certainly.
('72', 144, 5, 12, 254189) What is your secondary education but compelling the poor boys to learn in a foreign language in seven years what they should learn in the course of a couple of years in their own mother tongue?
('72', 144, 5, 13, 254383) If you can but make up your minds to free the children from the incubus of learning their subjects in a foreign tongue, and if you teach them to use their hands and feet profitably, the educational puzzle is solved.
('72', 144, 5, 14, 254599) You can sacrifice without compunction the whole of the drink revenue.
('72', 144, 5, 15, 254669) But you must resolve to sacrifice this revenue first, and think of the ways and means about education later.
('72', 144, 5, 16, 254778) Make the beginning by taking the big step.
('72', 144, 6, 17, 254821) Q. But would just the mere declaration of prohibition mean prohibition?
('72', 144, 6, 18, 254893) May it not be that we may sacrifice the revenue without touching the curse of drink, not to talk of abolishing it?
('72', 144, 7, 19, 255008) A. The declaration does not mean that you will thereafter sit still.
('72', 144, 7, 20, 255077) You will impress everyone into your service.
('72', 144, 7, 21, 255122) In fact the whole staff is there—the staff of excise inspectors, their superior officers, and the whole of their subordinate staff.
('72', 144, 7, 22, 255254) You will tell them that they will serve on no other terms but those of working for total abolition of drink.
('72', 144, 7, 23, 255363) You will convert every grog shop into a recreation centre.
('72', 144, 7, 24, 255422) You will

('72', 145, 0, 1, 255487) 146 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 145, 1, 2, 255529) concentrate on places where opportunities for getting drunk are greatest.
('72', 145, 1, 3, 255603) You will ask the mill owners and factory owners to provide light refreshment stalls, you will provide there refreshing drinks for them like sugar cane juice, games for them, lantern shows for them, and make them feel that they are like you.
('72', 145, 1, 4, 255844) Impress everyone, without exception, into your service.
('72', 145, 1, 5, 255900) The village school master and the other official should be all prohibition workers.
('72', 145, 2, 6, 255984) Q. Very good.
('72', 145, 2, 7, 255998) But in many places you will find the village Patel and others joining the drinking folk in their drunken revels.
('72', 145, 2, 8, 256111) What about them?
('72', 145, 3, 9, 256128) A. Every one of your school children will be a prohibition worker.
('72', 145, 3, 10, 256195) Ministers will be going up and down the country visiting the grog shops turned recreation centres, have their cup of refreshing dirnk with the common folk and make these houses fashionable.
('72', 145, 3, 11, 256385) Don’t be deterred by the thought that prohibition failed in America.
('72', 145, 3, 12, 256454) Remember that the stupendous experiment was tried there, where drinking is not looked upon as a vice, where millions usually drink.
('72', 145, 3, 13, 256586) Here drink is held reprehensible by all religions, and it is not the millions who drink but individuals who drink.

('72', 146, 1, 2, 257327) 202. NOTES
('72', 146, 2, 3, 257338) NOT INSTRUMENT OF INSTRUCTIONS What I have been recently writing in connection with the constructive programme before the Congress Ministries has been described by some newspapers as “Instrument of Instructions”.
('72', 146, 2, 4, 257551) No one but the President of the Congress and the Working Committee has any power to issue instructions to the Congress Ministries.
('72', 146, 2, 5, 257682) Mine is a very humble note.
('72', 146, 2, 6, 257710) I can only advise on matters about which I may claim special Knowledge or experience.
('72', 146, 2, 7, 257796) My articles have a value only to the extent that they appeal to the reason of those to whom they are addressed.
('72', 146, 2, 8, 257908) Though I enjoy the confidence of the Working Committee, the views I may express here need not be taken to represent its views or even those of any of its groups.
('72', 146, 2, 9, 258070) Indeed the public should know that in several matters I do not represent the views of many individual members.
('72', 146, 2, 10, 258181) Therefore, whatever I may say in these columns should be taken to be purely personal to me and in no way representative of the Working Committee.
('72', 146, 2, 11, 258327) But in matters relating to the struggle for swaraj through non violent action.
('72', 146, 2, 12, 258406) I do claim special qualifications.
('72', 146, 2, 13, 258441) For me office acceptance has a special meaning even in terms of the Congress manifesto and resolutions.
('72', 146, 2, 14, 258545) It would be wrong if I did not put before the Ministers and the public my meaning of office acceptance.
('72', 146, 2, 15, 258649) But it may not always be the official Congress view, it may not be the view of Congressmen in general.
('72', 146, 2, 16, 258752) My position and limitations being made clear, there need be no embarrassment to the Ministers or me.
('72', 146, 2, 17, 258853) I should feel cramped if my writings were presumed to bear the imprimatur of the official or even the non official Congress view.
('72', 146, 3, 18, 258983) Harijan, 21 8 1937
('72', 146, 4, 19, 259002) 203. THE IMPLICATIONS
('72', 146, 5, 20, 259024) I have not hesitated to express my opinion that the salaries that the Congress Ministers have voted for themselves are much too high for the standard that govern us in this the poorest country in the would.
('72', 146, 5, 21, 259231) In the hurried note that Prof.
('72', 146, 5, 22, 259262) K. T. Shah has sent me and which the reader will find elsewhere, India’s average annual per capita income will be found to be £4 against £50 of Great Britain.
('72', 146, 5, 23, 259421) Unfortunately for us we have to bear yet a while the burden of the
('72', 147, 0, 1, 259488) 148 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 147, 1, 2, 259530) British inheritance, and in spite of the best effort we fail to achieve the ideal standard.
('72', 147, 1, 3, 259622) The salaries and the allowances are now a settled fact.
('72', 147, 1, 4, 259678) The question now is, will the Ministers, their secretaries and the Members work so hard as to deserve the emoluments they will receive?
('72', 147, 1, 5, 259814) Will the Members become whole time workers for the nation and give a faithful account of the services they may render?
('72', 147, 1, 6, 259933) Let us not make the mistake of imagining that the things are what we wish them to be or what they should be.
('72', 147, 1, 7, 260042) And it is not enough that the Ministers live simply and work hard.
('72', 147, 1, 8, 260109) They have to see to it that the departments they control also respond.
('72', 147, 1, 9, 260180) Thus justice should become cheap and expeditious.
('72', 147, 1, 10, 260230) Today it is the luxury of the rich and the joy of the gambler.
('72', 147, 1, 11, 260293) The police should be friends of the people instead of being their dread.
('72', 147, 1, 12, 260366) Education should be so revolutionized as to answer the wants of the poorest villager instead of answering those of an imperial exploiter.
('72', 147, 1, 13, 260504) All those who were imprisoned for political offences even of a violent nature will shortly find themselves free if the Ministers can give them the freedom.
('72', 147, 1, 14, 260660) This is a phenomenon not to be looked at lightly.
('72', 147, 1, 15, 260710) Does it mean passport to violence?
('72', 147, 1, 16, 260745) Certainly not in terms of the Congress creed of non violence.
('72', 147, 1, 17, 260807) The Congress abhors individual violence in a far more real sense than the Government it replaces.
('72', 147, 1, 18, 260905) It seeks to meet the violence of individuals not with the organized violence called punishment but with non violence in the shape of friendly approach to the erring individuals and through the cultivation of sound public opinion against any form of violence.
('72', 147, 1, 19, 261164) Its methods are preventive, not punitive.
('72', 147, 1, 20, 261206) In other words, the Congress will rule not through the police backed by the military but through its moral authority based upon the greatest goodwill of the people.
('72', 147, 1, 21, 261371) It will rule not in virtue of authority derived from a superior armed power but in virtue of the service of the people whom it seeks to represent in every one of its actions.
('72', 147, 1, 22, 261546) Ban on all prohibited literature is being removed.
('72', 147, 1, 23, 261597) Now some of the books banned will be found, I suppose, to inculcate violence and spread obscenity, or hatred among different classes or sects.
('72', 147, 1, 24, 261740) The Congress rule does not mean licence to violence or obscenity or fomenting of hatred.
('72', 147, 1, 25, 261829) Again the Congress will rely upon the unstinted support of enlightened public opinion in dealing with objectionable literature.
('72', 147, 1, 26, 261957) The Ministers who may find violence, hatred or obscenity spreading in their provinces will look to the Congress organizations and ultimately the Working Committee for active and efficient help before they resort to the processes of the criminal law and all it means.
('72', 147, 1, 27, 262224) Indeed the triumph of the Congress will be measured
('72', 148, 0, 1, 262276) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 149
('72', 148, 1, 2, 262320) by the success it achieves in rendering the police and the military practically idle.
('72', 148, 1, 3, 262406) And it will fail utterly if it has to face crises that render the use of the police and the military inevitable.
('72', 148, 1, 4, 262519) The best and the only effective way to wreck the existing Constitution is for the Congress to prove conclusively that it can rule without the aid of the military and with the least possible assistance of the police who may well have some new and friendly designation given to them as a correspondent suggests.

('72', 148, 4, 8, 262919) MY DEAR VERRIER, Your letter to Jamnalalji and now the fuller letter to Bapa make distressful reading.
('72', 148, 4, 9, 263022) God has saved you for greater service.
('72', 148, 4, 10, 263061) You must not give way to dejection.
('72', 148, 4, 11, 263097) Dejection is the measure of one’s want of faith.
('72', 148, 4, 12, 263146) You say in Bapa’s letter: “I have lost most of my Christian or religious faith.
('72', 148, 4, 13, 263226) How can a just and good God allow these sufferings of the poor?” Are you not judging God?
('72', 148, 4, 14, 263316) Who are we to say why He allows certain things?
('72', 148, 4, 15, 263364) There would be little play for faith, if we could reason out every act of God.
('72', 148, 4, 16, 263443) We would then be co equal with Him.
('72', 148, 4, 17, 263479) I understand the persecution to which you have been subjected.
('72', 148, 4, 18, 263542) 1 But that is the moment of your trial.
('72', 148, 4, 19, 263582) Your faith must be immovable like the Himalayas.
('72', 148, 4, 20, 263631) They will suffer decay, but not so your faith, if it is worth anything.
('72', 148, 4, 21, 263703) No, no, it won’t do.
('72', 148, 4, 22, 263724) You must cheer up.
('72', 148, 4, 23, 263743) No more of idle sorrow!
('72', 148, 4, 24, 263767) Thakkar Bapa in his covering letter to Mahadev says Elwin thinks Bapu is displeased with him.
('72', 148, 4, 25, 263861) What is this libel on you by him, or by you on me?
('72', 148, 4, 26, 263912) I have differed from you.
('72', 148, 4, 27, 263938) That you know.
('72', 148, 4, 28, 263953) You have never given me cause for displeasure.
('72', 148, 4, 29, 264000) My love can stand many trials.
('72', 148, 4, 30, 264031) But you have not put it through any.
('72', 148, 4, 31, 264068) It burns as bright as ever.

('72', 149, 9, 13, 264750) JAYANTI, I have your letter.
('72', 149, 9, 14, 264779) The years pass for all, old and young.
('72', 149, 9, 15, 264818) The wheel of time never stops moving even for a moment.
('72', 149, 9, 16, 264874) All of you were but little children yesterday.
('72', 149, 9, 17, 264921) Now you are all children no more.
('72', 149, 9, 18, 264955) I have to make an effort to remember this.
('72', 149, 9, 19, 264998) May your aspirations be fulfilled and your life be spent in relieving the sufferings of the hungry and other afflicted people.
('72', 149, 9, 20, 265125) Why don’t you write directly to Sardar drawing his attention to the unusual changes about which you have written in your letter to me?
('72', 149, 9, 21, 265260) Are you afraid that he will not pay attention to you?
('72', 149, 9, 22, 265314) If you have any such doubt, dispel it.
('72', 149, 9, 23, 265353) I hope Dinkar is getting stronger.
('72', 149, 9, 24, 265388) It would be very good if Indu’s mind becomes steady.

('72', 150, 10, 18, 266347) MULSHANKER, I do not seem to have received your letter of the 19th March.
('72', 150, 10, 19, 266421) It is certainly good that you are doing the work with your whole heart in it.
('72', 150, 10, 20, 266499) Please keep it up.This is what I believe to be dharma regarding marriage.
('72', 150, 10, 21, 266573) Parents cannot force their children to marry, or to marry a particular person.
('72', 150, 10, 22, 266652) While making their choice, the son or the daughter should listen with the utmost respect to their parents’ advice, but need not marry anybody whom their heart does not accept.
('72', 150, 10, 23, 266828) At the same time they should not form an alliance which would displease their parents.
('72', 150, 10, 24, 266915) I see no harm in restraining the desire for marriage as long as one can preserve self control.
('72', 150, 10, 25, 267010) But one must not deceive oneself in any way.
('72', 150, 10, 26, 267055) When the time for courting imprisonment comes again, those who have in them a strong spirit of self sacrifice will have a right to do so.
('72', 150, 10, 27, 267193) In this one should try to obtain the blessings of one’s elders.

('72', 152, 6, 10, 268974) You differed honestly, you have revised your view openly.
('72', 152, 6, 11, 269032) As to education you will see the use I have made of your letter in the forthcoming issue of Harijan.
('72', 152, 7, 12, 269133) I am under strict order to take rest if I am to escape serious consequences.

('72', 153, 2, 3, 269721) SEGAON, WARDHA, August 24, 1937
('72', 153, 3, 4, 269753) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter 1 of the 17th instant.
('72', 153, 3, 5, 269817) Evidently I did not quite understand what H. E. the Viceroy said to me about trans Frontier.
('72', 153, 3, 6, 269910) I understood him to mean that he could not think of permitting me to cross the border.
('72', 153, 3, 7, 269997) And I accepted what I understood to be the Viceroy’s decision adding that I did not lose the hope that, when I have inspired sufficient confidence as to my integrity and ability, I could safely be permitted to cross the Frontier.
('72', 153, 3, 8, 270227) But that is irrelevant to this letter.
('72', 153, 3, 9, 270266) I would like to know the implication of “leaving all affairs connected with the tribes severely alone” during my visit.
('72', 153, 3, 10, 270386) Not that I have the slightest desire to meddle in trans Frontier affairs.
('72', 153, 3, 11, 270460) My intention is, as it was when I first broached the subject to Lord Irwin 2, as Lord Halifax then was, to know the Frontier Pathan in his own home, to make the acquaintance of Khudai Khidmatgars, to ascertain for myself how far their claim to be utterly non violent could be sustained and how I could promote the general welfare of the Pathans which is dear to the heart of Khan Saheb Abdul Ghaffar Khan.
('72', 153, 3, 12, 270866) He puts implicit reliance upon my judgment as I put on his transparency and trustworthiness.
('72', 153, 3, 13, 270959) But I suppose it is inevitable that people will come to me to talk about trans Frontier affairs.
('72', 153, 3, 14, 271056) Am I not to listen to their narratives and even give my opinion if I were asked toexpress it and could form one on what they might tell me?
('72', 153, 3, 15, 271196) If I succeed in visiting the Frontier Province, I should certainly feel sorry if I had to leave it without having the pleasure of renewing the acquaintance we made during the time you were at Delhi.
('72', 153, 3, 16, 271395) I await your further letter about the Khan Saheb’s question.
('72', 153, 4, 17, 271456) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI [PS.] I just read in the papers the ban has been lifted.
('72', 153, 4, 18, 271543) I am grateful.

('72', 154, 3, 5, 271996) May you remain loyal to your noble resolve!
('72', 154, 3, 6, 272040) Such self sacrifices are certainly needed.

('72', 155, 4, 7, 273807) QUESTLON: A professor who is married wants to observe brahmacharya.
('72', 155, 4, 8, 273875) The wife doesn’t agree.
('72', 155, 4, 9, 273899) What is the professor friend’s dharma in these circumstances?
('72', 155, 5, 10, 273961) ANSWER: This question could have arisen only if the idea of observing brahmacharya came to the husband after marriage.
('72', 155, 5, 11, 274080) What I mean by marriage as a part of dharma is that intercourse between husband and wife is resorted to only when they desire children, and never for sex gratification.
('72', 155, 5, 12, 274249) Those who do not look upon marriage as a holy bond will of course respect each other’s wishes.
('72', 155, 5, 13, 274344) Intercourse without the consent of the other party is nothing but rape.
('72', 155, 5, 14, 274416) Let us now deal with the above mentioned question.
('72', 155, 5, 15, 274467) In a case in which it is only the husband who wishes to observe brahmacharya but the wife does not, if the husband has become completely free from passion, that is, has, in the language of the Gita, Ch. II, v.
('72', 155, 5, 16, 274677) 59, realized the Supreme, intercourse will be physically impossible.
('72', 155, 5, 17, 274746) The wife will realize the husband’s condition and her passion will subside.
('72', 155, 5, 18, 274822) But the question refers to a man’s striving for brahmacharya.
('72', 155, 5, 19, 274884) A husband or wife can strive for any aim which was not present in the minds of both at the time of marriage, only with the consent of the other partner.
('72', 155, 5, 20, 275037) In other words, a husband cannot take the vow of brahmacharya without the consent of his wife.
('72', 155, 5, 21, 275132) Of course everybody should try to practise ordinary self control.
('72', 155, 5, 22, 275198) When either party is aroused, generally the other party also is agreeable or becomes so after a little persuasion.
('72', 155, 5, 23, 275313) When this does not happen, bitterness results.
('72', 155, 5, 24, 275360) I have, therefore, come to the conclusion, from the experiences of many people and after careful reflection over them, that practice of self control depends on mutual consent.
('72', 155, 5, 25, 275536) I should therefore say that the question is defective.
('72', 155, 5, 26, 275591) Where brahmacharya has become a natural condition, the question does not arise.
('72', 155, 5, 27, 275671) And it has no room when passion is present and the person only wants to strive for brahmacharya.

('72', 156, 3, 4, 275960) BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS, What can I write?
('72', 156, 3, 5, 275997) My mind can work in one direction only.
('72', 156, 3, 6, 276037) I do not know how I can be of help.
('72', 156, 3, 7, 276073) What opinion can I form on a matter I know nothing about?
('72', 156, 3, 8, 276131) Hence I would only suggest that you do what is in the interest of India irrespective of the opinion of Congressmen.
('72', 156, 3, 9, 276247) Rest assured that the Congress will have to accept what is for the country’s good.
('72', 156, 3, 10, 276330) And its prestige will suffer in rejecting it.
('72', 156, 3, 11, 276376) The Con gress has no other capital except its prestige which in turn depends upon the following of the poor millions.
('72', 156, 3, 12, 276494) Thus the welfare of India means simply the economic, intellectual and moral welfare of its millions.
('72', 156, 3, 13, 276595) I have said nothing new but at times such pronouncements of principle are most effective when made by a friend.
('72', 156, 3, 14, 276707) One can say my health is quite good.
('72', 156, 3, 15, 276744) A little weakness is there but it will disappear.
('72', 156, 3, 16, 276794) There is no need for a change.
('72', 156, 3, 17, 276825) But it will automatically be brought about if the trip to the Frontier Province materializes.
('72', 156, 3, 18, 276919) For one thing the climate there is good and fruit, etc., are available in plenty.
('72', 156, 3, 19, 277001) You must be building up your health.

('72', 156, 9, 25, 277228) MY DEAR C. R.,
('72', 156, 10, 26, 277243) I wonder if you have a moment to think of Hindi Prachar Sabha.
('72', 156, 10, 27, 277306) Raghavan is anxious about its financial condition.
('72', 156, 10, 28, 277357) He seems to have no faith in the South and expects money from the North.
('72', 156, 10, 29, 277430) The latter is a broken reed.

('72', 157, 7, 8, 277904) DEAR SISTER, Here is my message.
('72', 157, 7, 9, 277937) You can do with it what you like.
('72', 157, 7, 10, 277971) Attainment of world peace is impossible except for greater scientific precision, greater travail of the soul, greater patience and greater resources than required for the invention and consolidation of the means of mutual slaughter.
('72', 157, 7, 11, 278204) It cannot be attained by a mere muster roll signed by millions of mankind desiring peace.
('72', 157, 7, 12, 278294) But it can, if there is a science of peace, as I hold there is, by a few devoting themselves to the discovery of the means.
('72', 157, 7, 13, 278418) Their effort being from within will not be showy but then it will not need a single farthing.
('72', 157, 8, 14, 278512) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI MRS.

('72', 158, 2, 3, 279055) SEGAON, August 26, 1937
('72', 158, 3, 4, 279079) CHANDAN, I have your frank letter.
('72', 158, 3, 5, 279114) I have no further questions to ask now.
('72', 158, 3, 6, 279154) You say that I should send that letter to Shankar 1 and not show it to anybody except Kakasaheb.
('72', 158, 3, 7, 279251) If we have got rid of a weakness of which we have been guilty, we shouldn’t mind the whole world knowing about it.
('72', 158, 3, 8, 279366) And why need we feel ashamed about it, either?
('72', 158, 3, 9, 279413) Moreover, you wish to serve women.
('72', 158, 3, 10, 279448) You wish to save girls from the clutches of .

('72', 158, 3, 12, 279566) How can you succeed in this unless you make public his misbehaviour with you?
('72', 158, 3, 13, 279644) From every point of view, therefore, you should have no objection to your letter being read by any person.
('72', 158, 3, 14, 279751) This does not mean, of course, that a letter like this should be shown to all.
('72', 158, 3, 15, 279830) But I should be free to show it to anybody to whom I may think it necessary to show.
('72', 158, 3, 16, 279915) Unless I make appropriate use of your letter, I can make no progress in my inquiry either.
('72', 158, 3, 17, 280006) I will, therefore, keep a copy and send the original to Shankar.
('72', 158, 3, 18, 280071) If you want to be strong enough to see this matter through, you will need to have strength of heart.
('72', 158, 3, 19, 280172) You will have to get some facts from your girl friends who have any knowledge of this matter.
('72', 158, 3, 20, 280266) If any of them is willing to write to me, encourage her to do so.
('72', 158, 3, 21, 280332) If the whole thing happened exactly as you have described, you have nothing to feel ashamed about.

('72', 158, 3, 25, 280597) Am I right?
('72', 158, 3, 26, 280609) Continue to write to me without any constraint.
('72', 158, 3, 27, 280657) I am sending a copy of your letter to Nanabhai 3 at any rate.

('72', 160, 7, 10, 282789) Marriage is not an affair in which one person can dispose of his girls or boys against their will.
('72', 160, 7, 11, 282888) My boy married Shri Rajagopala chari’s daughter because they fell in love with each other in perfectly honourable manner and the couple had our blessings.
('72', 160, 7, 12, 283043) I would be glad to think that you could also be similarly matched.
('72', 160, 7, 13, 283110) I have absolutely no prejudices, but no third party can bring about such matches.
('72', 160, 7, 14, 283192) I see nothing unhygienic in a person carrying a moustache or a shikha or both.
('72', 160, 7, 15, 283271) I cannot give any reason for this age long custom but I do not believe in setting aside customs for which I can give no valid reason but which are not repugnant to my moral or sanitary sense.

('72', 162, 10, 16, 286033) I see that, as it is; the hand operated grinding stones are going out of use.
('72', 162, 10, 17, 286111) It is even difficult to procure one.
('72', 162, 10, 18, 286148) Even so, think over the matter and write to me.
('72', 162, 10, 19, 286196) How many machines are operating in the U. P. and Gorakhpur?
('72', 162, 10, 20, 286256) Find out if one can get as much flour as one needs if the use of machines is discontinued.
('72', 162, 10, 21, 286347) Also consider whether, if the use of smaller machines is stopped, the tons of white flour prepared in Bombay and other places will not find its way into the villages.
('72', 162, 10, 22, 286514) The flour of the smaller machines is much better.

('72', 163, 3, 8, 286942) Probably he will himself come over and attend to everything.
('72', 163, 3, 9, 287003) According to me the expense seems to be so great that the villagers cannot hold a session like this.
('72', 163, 3, 10, 287104) This will not be a village Congress.
('72', 163, 3, 11, 287141) The idea of a Congress in a village is that all the expenses are kept within two to three thousand rupees.
('72', 163, 3, 12, 287248) Will not the expense on water supply also be a waste once the session is over?
('72', 163, 3, 13, 287327) Isn’t there any way by which we can avoid all this expense?
('72', 163, 3, 14, 287387) I feel that a Congress session for so many people will cost less in a city.
('72', 163, 3, 15, 287463) If this is true, there is something wrong somewhere.

('72', 163, 6, 19, 287611) [Before August 28, 1937]
('72', 163, 7, 20, 287636) GANDHIJI: If we can achieve prohibition within the next three years, and if we can demonstrate to the world that we can do without the military in the provinces, we shall have raised India’s name to a height that it had never reached before and to which no nation has yet reached.
('72', 163, 7, 21, 287917) The task of making people sober is a task of the most vital importance and no amount of energy devoted to it is likely to be wasted.
('72', 163, 7, 22, 288050) It will at once be a kind of true adult education and [a means] of improving the taxable capacity of the citizen.

('72', 164, 1, 3, 288710) They now know well enough that the Congress will not rest in peace and will not let others rest in peace until it has achieved prohibition, and they will gladly fall into line with the new policy and programme.
('72', 164, 1, 4, 288921) But the voluntary agencies will be more effective.
('72', 164, 1, 5, 288972) There are our professors and teachers, and students of colleges.
('72', 164, 1, 6, 289037) They may well be called upon to devote a couple of hours each day to the task.
('72', 164, 1, 7, 289116) They should go to the areas frequented by the drinkers, associate with them, speak to them and reason with them and do peaceful picketing of an educative character.
('72', 164, 1, 8, 289281) I look to the medical profession to put their heads together to find out why people drink, how they can be weaned from drink, find out effective, wholesome and healthful substitutes of drink.
('72', 164, 1, 9, 289473) Then there are our sisters.
('72', 164, 1, 10, 289501) They did great work during the non co operation days.
('72', 164, 1, 11, 289555) They should be organized again to revive the work under better auspices now.
('72', 164, 1, 12, 289632) Whilst their presence will be a sure deterrent, they will have few difficulties in the way.
('72', 164, 1, 13, 289724) Before, the police looked indifferently on, and even helped the ruffians in the days gone by.
('72', 164, 1, 14, 289818) Now, women can count on their help in their holy crusade.
('72', 164, 1, 15, 289876) Then there are the temperance associations.
('72', 164, 1, 16, 289920) Most of them have been up to now inert and inactive.
('72', 164, 1, 17, 289973) We should now ask them to pull themselves together and engage actively in the crusade.
('72', 164, 1, 18, 290060) We might well have a Prohibition League under which all these agencies may work in a regular and systematic manner.
('72', 164, 1, 19, 290176) The revenue drawn from excise may rightly be used for the prohibition campaign.
('72', 164, 1, 20, 290256) That will be no forbidden use of tainted money, but something like turning a channel of foul water into the holy Ganges and making it pure.
('72', 164, 1, 21, 290396) Above all, find out the plague spots., concentrate your forces on them.
('72', 164, 1, 22, 290468) Have meetings of the liquor contractors and liquor dealers, teach them how to turn an honest penny by converting their liquor booths into recreation centres.
('72', 164, 1, 23, 290626) I have already described 1 how these places may be turned into centres of harmless recreation and even of educative amusement.

('72', 165, 2, 3, 290871) DANGEROUS EVEN IN FRIGID ZONE Apropos of my remark 1 that alcohol might be required in a frigid zone, a friend sends me the following interesting paragraph from Liquor Control by G. E. G. Catlin who while discussing the apparent warming effect of alcohol says:
('72', 165, 3, 4, 291132) A simple mechanical consideration should, however, warn us against a misinterpretation of these results.
('72', 165, 3, 5, 291237) The body temperature has not been changed but the warmer blood has been sent to the surface where, if it is chilled, it returns to reduce the temperature of the whole system.
('72', 165, 3, 6, 291412) In cases where there is serious need of protection against cold, alcohol is not only useless but dangerous.
('72', 165, 3, 7, 291520) Fridtjof Nansen 2 stated that ‘my experience leads me to take a decided stand against the use of stimulants and narcotics of all sorts’ in Arctic journeys—in the case of alcohol owing to the increased risk of death by freezing.
('72', 165, 3, 8, 291748) We in India, however, do not need such testimony.
('72', 165, 3, 9, 291798) We have no excuse apparent or real for taking alcoholic drinks in our temperate zone where the sun gives us all the warmth we need.
('72', 165, 3, 10, 291930) NEEDLESS FEAR A Liberal friend 3 after highly appreciating the Congress programme of prohibition within three years thus expresses his fear about education:
('72', 165, 4, 11, 292087) The educational programme of the Congress seems to be causing some uneasiness.
('72', 165, 4, 12, 292166) There is a fear that it may result in blocking the progress of higher education.
('72', 165, 4, 13, 292247) I hope that till a well considered scheme is adumbrated and sufficient notice given of the changes proposed, no precipitate step should be taken, at any rate without giving an opportunity to the public to discuss the Congress proposals fully.
('72', 165, 4, 14, 292490) The fear is wholly needless.
('72', 165, 4, 15, 292519) The Working Committee has laid down no general policy.
('72', 165, 4, 16, 292574) The Congress, except for being responsible for the existence of many national educational institutions, e.g., the Kashi Vidyapith, Jamia Millia, Tilak Vidyapith, Bihar Vidyapith, Gujarat Vidyapith and the like, has made no general announcement.
('72', 165, 4, 17, 292819) What I have written is my personal contribution to the discussion.
('72', 165, 5, 18, 292886) 1 Vide “Against Ahimsa and Truth”, 14 8 1937 2 (1861 1930); Norwegian Polar explorer, who was awarded Nobel Prize in 1922 3 G. A. Natesan; vide “Letter to G. A. Natesan”, 24 8 1937

('72', 166, 1, 2, 293111) Indeed I feel most strongly about the vast injury that the existing system of education has done to the youth of the country and to the languages and general culture of India.
('72', 166, 1, 3, 293287) I hold my views strongly.
('72', 166, 1, 4, 293313) But I do not claim to have converted Congressmen in general.
('72', 166, 1, 5, 293374) What then can be said of those educationists who are outside even the Congress atmosphere and who dominate the Universities of India?
('72', 166, 1, 6, 293508) It is no easy task to convert them.
('72', 166, 1, 7, 293544) My friend and those who share his fear may rest assured that the advice given by Shri Shastriar will be taken to heart by those concerned and no serious step will be taken without due consideration and consultation with the persons whose advice is of value in matters educational.
('72', 166, 1, 8, 293825) I may add that I am already in correspondence with many educationists and am already receiving valuable opinions which I am happy to be able to say are in general agreement with my scheme.
('72', 166, 2, 9, 294014) WHAT ABOUT LITERACY?
('72', 166, 2, 10, 294035) I have received many opinions on the ideas I have been propounding in these columns on education.
('72', 166, 2, 11, 294133) I may be able to reproduce the most important of them in these columns.
('72', 166, 2, 12, 294205) For the moment I wish to answer a grievance a learned correspondent has made of the neglect of literacy of which he imagines I have been guilty.
('72', 166, 2, 13, 294350) There is nothing in what I have written to warrant such a belief.
('72', 166, 2, 14, 294416) For have I not contended that the children in the schools of my conception will receive every instruction through the handicrafts they may be taught?
('72', 166, 2, 15, 294566) That includes literacy.
('72', 166, 2, 16, 294590) In my scheme of things the hand will handle tools before it draws or traces the writing.
('72', 166, 2, 17, 294679) The eyes will read the pictures of letters and words as they will know other things in life, the ears will catch the names and meanings of things and sentences.
('72', 166, 2, 18, 294840) The whole training will be natural, responsive, and therefore the quickest and the cheapest in the land.
('72', 166, 2, 19, 294945) The children of my school will therefore read much more quickly than they will write.
('72', 166, 2, 20, 295031) And when they write they will not produce daubs as I do even now (thanks to my teachers), but they will trace correct letters even as they will trace correct figures of the objects they may see.
('72', 166, 2, 21, 295226) If the schools of my conception ever come into being, I make bold to say that they will vie with the most advanced schools in quickness, so far as reading is concerned, and even writing if it is common ground that the writing must be correct and not incorrect as now is in the vast majority of cases.
('72', 166, 2, 22, 295527) The children of the Segaon school may be said to be writing in accordance with the orthodox standard; they spoil slate and paper according to my standard.

('72', 167, 1, 2, 295743) 229. THE GREATEST ACT
('72', 167, 2, 3, 295765) In as much as prohibition has been one of the chief planks of the Congress since the inauguration of the non cooperation movement in 1920, and thousands of men and women have had to suffer imprisonment and physical injury in furtherance of this cause, the Working Committee is of opinion that it is incumbent upon the Congress Ministries to work for this end.
('72', 167, 2, 4, 296125) The Committee expects them to bring about total prohibition in their respective provinces within three years.
('72', 167, 2, 5, 296235) The Working Committee appeals to the Ministries in other provinces, and to the Indian States also, to adopt this programme of moral and social uplift of the people.
('72', 167, 2, 6, 296400) I regard this resolution as the greatest act of the Working Com mittee 1 at any time of its chequered career.
('72', 167, 2, 7, 296510) The cry of prohibition has been always fashionable.
('72', 167, 2, 8, 296562) In 1920 it became one of the chief constructive items of the Congress.
('72', 167, 2, 9, 296633) The Congress, therefore, could not but go in for total prohibition immediately it came into power in any part of India.
('72', 167, 2, 10, 296753) The Ministers had to have the courage to sacrifice nearly Rs. eleven crores of revenue in the six provinces.
('72', 167, 2, 11, 296862) The Working Committee has taken the risk for the sake of redeeming its pledge and conserving the moral and the material welfare of those who are addicted to intoxicants and narcotics.
('72', 167, 2, 12, 297046) It is my fervent hope that the five provinces which have non Congress majorities will not hesitate to follow the example of the six provinces.
('72', 167, 2, 13, 297189) It is less difficult for them than for the six provinces to achieve prohibition.
('72', 167, 2, 14, 297270) And is it too much to expect the States to fall in with British India?
('72', 167, 2, 15, 297341) I know that many are sceptical about prohibition being achieved.
('72', 167, 2, 16, 297406) They think that the financial lure will be too strong for them to resist.
('72', 167, 2, 17, 297480) They argue that the addicts will procure their drinks and drugs anyhow, and that when the Ministers discover that prohibition means mere loss of revenue without any appreciable diminution in the consumption, though illicit, of drinks and drugs, they will revert to the tainted revenue and the then state will be worse than the present.
('72', 167, 2, 18, 297816) I do not share any such fear.
('72', 167, 2, 19, 297846) I believe there is the requisite moral momentum in the nation to achieve the noble end.
('72', 167, 2, 20, 297934) If prohibition is to be a reality, we shall begin to see the end not with the end of the three years but inside of six months.
('72', 167, 2, 21, 298061) And when the reality dawns upon India, those provinces or States that have lagged behind
('72', 167, 3, 22, 298150) 1 Which met at Wardha from August 14 to 17, 1937
('72', 168, 0, 1, 298199) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 169
('72', 168, 1, 2, 298243) are bound to bow to the inevitable.
('72', 168, 1, 3, 298279) We have the right, therefore, to expect the sympathy and support not only of all the parties in India including the Europeans but the best mind of the whole world in this, perhaps the greatest moral movement of the century.
('72', 168, 1, 4, 298503) If, then, prohibition is to mean a great moral awakening in India, the closing of liquor shops should merely mean the indispensable beginning of the movement ending in the complete weaning from drink and narcotics of those poor people and some rich people whom the habit has ruined, body and soul.
('72', 168, 1, 5, 298801) Such a consummation cannot be brought about by mere State effort.
('72', 168, 1, 6, 298867) At the risk of repetition of what is stated by Mahadev Desai in his notes, let me summarize what should, in my opinion, be the comprehensive programme: (1) A drink drug map showing the locality of liquor and opium shops in each province.
('72', 168, 1, 7, 299105) (2) Closing them as liquor shops on the expiry of the licences.
('72', 168, 1, 8, 299169) (3) Immediate earmarking of liquor revenue, whilst it is still being received, exclusively for the purpose of prohibition.
('72', 168, 1, 9, 299292) (4) Conversion, wherever possible, of the liquor shops into refreshment and recreation rooms in the hope that the original visitors will continue to use them, liquor contractors being themselves persuaded to conduct them if they will.
('72', 168, 1, 10, 299527) (5) Employment of the existing excise staff for detection of illicit distillation and drinking.
('72', 168, 1, 11, 299623) (6) Appeal to the educational institutions to devote a part of the time of teachers and students to temperance work.
('72', 168, 1, 12, 299740) (7) Appeal to the women to organize visits to the persons given to the drink and opium habits.
('72', 168, 1, 13, 299835) (8) Negotiation with the neighbouring States to undertake simultaneous prohibition.
('72', 168, 1, 14, 299919) (9) Engaging the voluntary or, if necessary, paid assistance of the medical profession for suggesting non alcoholic drinks and other substitutes for intoxicants and methods of weaning the addicts from their habit.
('72', 168, 1, 15, 300133) (10) Revival of the activities of temperance associations in support of the campaign against drink.
('72', 168, 1, 16, 300233) (11) Requiring employers of labour to open and maintain,
('72', 169, 0, 1, 300290) 170 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 169, 1, 2, 300332) under first class management, refreshment, recreation and educational rooms for the use of their employees.
('72', 169, 1, 3, 300440) (12) Toddy tappers to be used for drawing sweet toddy for sale, as such, or conversion into gur.
('72', 169, 1, 4, 300537) I understand that the process of collecting sweet toddy for drinking, as such, or for making gur is different from the one for fermenting toddy.
('72', 169, 1, 5, 300682) So much for the campaign against drink and drugs.
('72', 169, 1, 6, 300732) Now as to how to make up for the loss of revenue in some provinces to the extent of one third.
('72', 169, 1, 7, 300827) I have unhesitatingly suggested cutting out the educational budget for which purpose mainly the excise revenue is used.
('72', 169, 1, 8, 300947) I still maintain that education can be made self supporting.
('72', 169, 1, 9, 301008) With this I must deal elsewhere.
('72', 169, 1, 10, 301041) 1 It cannot be made so in a day even if the possibility of its being made self supporting is accepted.
('72', 169, 1, 11, 301144) Existing obligations have to be met.
('72', 169, 1, 12, 301181) Therefore, fresh sources of revenue have to be tapped.
('72', 169, 1, 13, 301236) Death duties, tax on tobacco including bidis, have already been given as some suggestions.
('72', 169, 1, 14, 301327) If these are considered impossible of immediate accomplishment, short term loans may be devised to tide over the deficit; and if even that fails, the Central Government should be approached to curtail the military budget and give the provinces the proportionate grant.
('72', 169, 1, 15, 301596) The demand would be irresistible especially if it is demonstrated by the Provincial Governments that they do not need the military, at any rate for their internal peace and tranquillity.

('72', 169, 2, 17, 301802) 230. “SUFFICIENTLY ACQUAINTED”
('72', 169, 3, 18, 301833) A professor writes:
('72', 169, 4, 19, 301853) You have suggested that even if an M. L. A. can express himself in English it is open to him to declare that he is not ‘sufficiently’ acquainted with it and thus enable the Speaker, who is of course not expected to question his bona fides, to allow him to speak in Hindustani.
('72', 169, 4, 20, 302130) I have read your remarks 2 with the greatest care but have not been able to see how a person having a scrupulous regard for truth can take this course, much less how you can suggest it.
('72', 169, 4, 21, 302316) Section 85 obviously refers to persons who find themselves unable to express their meaning in English well enough to make it intelligible to those who know English and not to those who do not know it.
('72', 169, 4, 22, 302517) There can be no
('72', 169, 5, 23, 302533) 1 Vide “Self supporting Education”, 11 9 1937 2 The reference is to Mahadev Desai’s interpretation of Section 85 of the Government of India Act of 1935; vide Appendix V.

('72', 170, 1, 2, 302747) question of ‘sufficient’ acquaintance with English for making oneself intelligible to the latter.
('72', 170, 1, 3, 302845) The wording is too clear to permit any other interpretation, and in face of it for anybody to declare himself insufficiently acquainted with English simply because there arc some fellow Members who do not understand English, looks like mere casuistry.
('72', 170, 1, 4, 303097) In U.P. they have got out of the difficulty by interpreting the words, ‘unacquainted or not sufficiently acquainted with the English language’ to mean less acquainted with the English language than with Hindi.
('72', 170, 1, 5, 303307) But I think the question of comparative acquaintance is also ruled out by the context.
('72', 170, 1, 6, 303394) I agree that the Section is highly obnoxious and must go.
('72', 170, 1, 7, 303452) If you suggested that it should be deliberately disobeyed, it would be a perfectly straightforward course and there could be no objection at least of the conscientious type.
('72', 170, 1, 8, 303626) As it is, however, you must have some justification for the course you have suggested, which I have been unable to see.
('72', 170, 1, 9, 303746) There must be others in the same position and we shall all benefit if you elucidate the point in the Harijan.
('72', 170, 1, 10, 303856) “Sufficient” can only have a relative meaning, not absolute.
('72', 170, 1, 11, 303917) Even an M. A. may not have “sufficient acquaintance” with English for the purpose before him.
('72', 170, 1, 12, 304011) Thus an M. A. from U. P. will surely not have sufficient knowledge of English to make himself understood by Hindustani speaking matriculates.
('72', 170, 1, 13, 304153) My teachers had often to speak in Gujarati in order to make themselves understood to the class they were teaching.
('72', 170, 1, 14, 304268) The reason was that they, most of them graduates, had to struggle through their English to make themselves intelligible to their class.
('72', 170, 1, 15, 304404) Speaking in Gujarati they became fluent, and our eyes sparkled as we drank in the wisdom they distilled into us.
('72', 170, 1, 16, 304517) If I was Speaker of an Assembly, I would certainly allow a most polished speaker in English to speak in Hindustani if he believed that he did not know sufficient English for the audience before him.
('72', 170, 1, 17, 304716) It is not a question of grammar or fluency.
('72', 170, 1, 18, 304760) It is a question of intelligibility.
('72', 170, 1, 19, 304797) To give any other mean ing to the Section would be to frustrate its very object.
('72', 170, 1, 20, 304878) An ungram matical English speech would amount to sufficient acquaintance with English if the audience could only understand English and no other language.
('72', 170, 1, 21, 305033) Such things have often happened during my numerous tours in India.
('72', 170, 1, 22, 305100) The meaning given in these columns is an honest atte mpt to deal with a difficult situation.
('72', 170, 1, 23, 305193) My well known partiality for the Indian languages for India had nothing to do with the inter pretation.
('72', 170, 1, 24, 305297) If I could not have honestly subscribed to the interpretation which Mahadev Desai’s ingenious brain conceived, I would certainly not have allowed it to go in and would have gladly advised a battle with the Government for a just and workable interpretation of the phrase “sufficiently acquianted”.
('72', 170, 1, 25, 305594) No doubt the proper course is to have the Section amended as the Punjab Premier has already suggested.

('72', 171, 8, 15, 306674) I have very carefully gone through your article “Not by Politics Alone”.

('72', 171, 8, 17, 306815) Your article drives me to what I suggested before.
('72', 171, 8, 18, 306866) 1 It resolves itself—and quite properly—into spreading your message through your book, other writings and through your speeches.
('72', 171, 8, 19, 306995) The sale of your book would be simply a bye product and may incidentally give you maintenance money.

('72', 172, 1, 4, 307598) Only I cannot yet see eye to eye with you.
('72', 172, 1, 5, 307641) It may be that there is something which I have not yet understood.

('72', 172, 5, 14, 308126) SEGAON, August 28, 1937
('72', 172, 6, 15, 308150) KAKA, Nimu (Ramdas’s) has come here.
('72', 172, 6, 16, 308187) I have encouraged her to learn Hindi, so that she may become qualified to spread knowledge of Hindi among women and may also, within limits, earn a living through that work.
('72', 172, 6, 17, 308361) She will need some knowledge of English, too, for my plan for her is that she should go to the South.
('72', 172, 6, 18, 308463) She has now become eager to learn Hindi as soon as possible.
('72', 172, 6, 19, 308524) I also suggested Allahabad to her for that purpose, for she will hear nothing but Hindi there.
('72', 172, 6, 20, 308619) But when she got ready to go to Allahabad, I was in a fix.
('72', 172, 6, 21, 308678) Where in Allahabad?
('72', 172, 6, 22, 308698) I, therefore, decided to send her to Vidyavati of the Kanya Gurukul at Dehradun.
('72', 172, 6, 23, 308779) But as soon as I started thinking about the matter last night, I felt I might ask your opinion too.
('72', 172, 6, 24, 308879) Would you prefer that she should be taught here?
('72', 172, 6, 25, 308928) Or would you like some other arrangement?
('72', 172, 6, 26, 308970) Give me your considered opinion.

('72', 173, 2, 3, 309137) The following is a free translation of a letter 2 of Shri Narahari Parikh on the conditions of Harijans in Kheda District.
('72', 173, 2, 4, 309260) If this is a correct picture of the actual state of things, it should not be beyond the power of the Kheda District Congress Committee to cope with it.

('72', 173, 3, 6, 309430) 235. A SUPERSTITION
('72', 173, 4, 7, 309450) There is no limit to superstitions in Kathiawar.
('72', 173, 4, 8, 309499) One such superstition concerns the taboo on the castration of calves.
('72', 173, 4, 9, 309569) It is found particularly in Kathiawar.
('72', 173, 4, 10, 309608) Peasants cannot earn their livelihood without oxen.
('72', 173, 4, 11, 309660) Hence they would buy oxen, allowing their own calves to wander about or die or let them be led to the slaughter house, and consider this as their dharma.
('72', 173, 4, 12, 309814) Such superstitions can be wiped out only when the rulers and the intelligent section of the public work against them whole heartedly.
('72', 173, 4, 13, 309948) A policy of punishment is perhaps pardonable in such instances.
('72', 173, 4, 14, 310012) Such a policy, when aimed at public welfare and not meant as punishment for its own sake, should be carefully devised.
('72', 173, 4, 15, 310131) Depriving the owners of their calves if they refuse to get them castrated may be the best punishment, and it may be accompanied by the condition that the owner could have his calf back provided he pays the charge of castrating it and the cost of keeping it.
('72', 173, 4, 16, 310389) If the fees for castration and the daily expense are fixed in advance, the public would not be handicapped and even a superstitious man would feel satisfied that the sin of castration is committed not by him but by the State.
('72', 173, 4, 17, 310615) The State must have a team of workers who would do the necessary propaganda about it, and it should be their job to remove such superstitions.
('72', 173, 4, 18, 310758) I would consider such a thing part of education, for, what value can knowledge have if it is not used for ending wrong practices among people?

('72', 174, 9, 15, 311809) It is not difficult to sell your ghee but there are a few easy methods you must learn.
('72', 174, 9, 16, 311896) Just now if you come over to Segaon you can be trained.
('72', 174, 9, 17, 311952) You should visit a few places in order to learn this.
('72', 174, 9, 18, 312006) There is a machine in Segaon, too, and it is operated every day.
('72', 174, 9, 19, 312071) You have to make the ghee yourself.
('72', 174, 9, 20, 312107) You must collect only milk.
('72', 174, 9, 21, 312135) You should be able to judge which cows would yield milk.
('72', 174, 9, 22, 312192) You should know about the bulls.
('72', 174, 9, 23, 312225) You ought to know something about all this.
('72', 174, 9, 24, 312269) I will tell Parnerkar 1, who is here, to write something on this and send it to you.

('72', 175, 13, 23, 313659) We supend hunger strike on assurance that the whole country has taken up our demands and because we are confidently hoping that within a reasonable period of time you will succeed in getting all our demands fulfilled.
('72', 175, 13, 24, 313877) We are glad you have given us the opportunity to express our firm opinion on terrorism.
('72', 175, 13, 25, 313965) We feel honoured to inform you and through you the nation that those of us who ever believed terrorism do not hold to it any more and are convinced of its futility as a political weapon or creed.

('72', 178, 7, 11, 317362) MY DEAR MATHEW, Whether I write “love” or do not makes no difference in my attitude towards you.
('72', 178, 7, 12, 317459) It all depends under what pressure I write letters.
('72', 178, 7, 13, 317511) There is no royal road to becoming moral.
('72', 178, 7, 14, 317553) You do so by prayer and penance and by living for the service of humanity.
('72', 178, 7, 15, 317628) When you do that you have no time to become immoral.
('72', 178, 7, 16, 317681) Of course, marriage is the ordinary thing for all.
('72', 178, 7, 17, 317732) I overcame the impulse to the extent I have done simply because the impulse for service was greater than the sexual impulse.
('72', 178, 7, 18, 317857) I do not know how many people who are associated with me are pure—nor have I any desire to pry into their lives.
('72', 178, 7, 19, 317970) I assume their purity until their impurity obtrudes itself upon my gaze.
('72', 178, 7, 20, 318043) A celibate is wedded to his work with which he has fallen in love.
('72', 178, 7, 21, 318110) If you see any difference between the two states I must accept defeat.

('72', 179, 3, 4, 318335) AMBUJAM, 1
('72', 179, 4, 5, 318346) I enclose herewith the name and address of Kamala’s mother.
('72', 179, 4, 6, 318406) I would like you to send her or pay her on my behalf Rs. 10, being Rs. 5 p.
('72', 179, 4, 7, 318482) as from her daughter.
('72', 179, 4, 8, 318504) This Rs. 10 will, therefore, be for two months.
('72', 179, 4, 9, 318552) I am asking you to undertake this commission so as to avoid the trouble of having to send an M. O. per month.
('72', 179, 4, 10, 318662) To send it through you means the saving of some expense also.
('72', 179, 4, 11, 318724) But you must be prepared to receive this amount from me.
('72', 179, 4, 12, 318781) I propose to send it to you in a lump sum.
('72', 179, 4, 13, 318824) If this mission of sending the money to Kamala’s mother proves in any way embarrassing to you inasmuch as you do not wish to have any relations with her, you will not hesitate to tell me so.
('72', 179, 4, 14, 319015) In that case I shall make other arrangements.
('72', 179, 4, 15, 319061) There is no immediate hurry.
('72', 179, 4, 16, 319090) I had the usual basket of fruit.

('72', 180, 3, 4, 319693) BHAI JETHALAL, The accompanying letters were written on the same day on which I had the postcard written [to you].
('72', 180, 3, 5, 319808) They are, however, being dispatched two days later since I had not been able to read them whereas the postcard was ready.
('72', 180, 3, 6, 319930) You will please acquaint yourself, within a month, with all those subjects that Bhai Parnerkar has listed under the different heads.
('72', 180, 3, 7, 320063) This will simplify your task.
('72', 180, 3, 8, 320093) I would therefore advise you to cheerfully accept one month.
('72', 180, 3, 9, 320154) I believe this will satisfy you.
('72', 180, 3, 10, 320187) I stipulate one month at the most.

('72', 180, 7, 13, 320304) 247. A SILENT CO WORKER GONE 1
('72', 180, 8, 14, 320335) [September 1, 1937] The inmates of the Satyagraha Ashram of Sabarmati are today a scattered family, joined together only by their common vow of silent service.
('72', 180, 8, 15, 320495) No one, perhaps, with the exception of the late Shri Maganlal Gandhi, personified so nearly this self effacing ideal as Shri Chhotelal Jain whose death, through suicide, has just stunned me.
('72', 180, 8, 16, 320686) I have not adequate language to describe his insatiable capacity for silent service.
('72', 180, 8, 17, 320771) He dreaded publicity and loved to live and serve unknown.
('72', 180, 8, 18, 320829) In fact it may be said of him that his right hand did not know what his left hand was doing.
('72', 180, 8, 19, 320922) I do not remember his ever visting his relations or being visited by them.
('72', 180, 8, 20, 320997) He never even mentioned them to anyone.
('72', 180, 8, 21, 321037) At the time of writing I do not even know their names or whereabouts.
('72', 180, 8, 22, 321107) I have the good luck to have a band of co workers who are to me as my hands and feet.
('72', 180, 8, 23, 321193) Without their willing and loyal cooperation I should feel utterly helpless.
('72', 180, 8, 24, 321269) Prominent among these was Chhotelal.
('72', 180, 9, 25, 321306) 1 The original in Gujarati of which this is an adaptation by Pyarelal appeared in Harijanbandhu, 5 9 1937.
('72', 181, 0, 1, 321413) 182 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 181, 1, 2, 321455) He had a versatile and powerful intelligence which shirked no task however difficult.
('72', 181, 1, 3, 321541) He was a born linguist.
('72', 181, 1, 4, 321565) Rajputana being his home, Hindi was his mother tongue, but he knew Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali, Tamil, Sanskrit and English as well.
('72', 181, 1, 5, 321697) He knew the Urdu script.
('72', 181, 1, 6, 321722) I have seldom seen anybody with such aptitude for quickly mastering a new language or a new task.
('72', 181, 1, 7, 321820) He was one of the foundation members of the Sabarmati Ashram.
('72', 181, 1, 8, 321882) He went through the whole range of Ashram activities with natural ease, and hardly touched anything that he did not adorn.
('72', 181, 1, 9, 322005) Thus he felt equally at home whether he was engaged in kitchen work, conservancy, spinning or weaving, accounts, or translation work, or correspondence.
('72', 181, 1, 10, 322158) He had an equal share with the late Maganlal in the writing of Vanatshastra 1. The riskier a job the more it was welcomed by Chhotelal, and once he took it up, he knew no rest till he had seen it through.
('72', 181, 1, 11, 322363) He threw himself, with the indefatigable energy which was his characteristic, into any task that he took up, and at the end of it he would still be fresh and ready for the next.
('72', 181, 1, 12, 322541) The words weariness and fatigue were not in his dictionary.
('72', 181, 1, 13, 322601) To render service only, never to receive any, was the passion of his life.
('72', 181, 1, 14, 322676) When the All India Village Industries Association was started at Wardha, it was Chhotelal who first learnt and then introduced the art of ghani 2 in Maganwadi.
('72', 181, 1, 15, 322836) It was he who introduced the wooden hand mill for rice husking.
('72', 181, 1, 16, 322900) Again, it was he who started bee culture there.
('72', 181, 1, 17, 322948) Today I feel disconsolate and crippled by his loss.
('72', 181, 1, 18, 323000) And I am sure, if we could only know it, the same must be the feeling of the bees whom he had gathered and was looking after with a mother’s care.
('72', 181, 1, 19, 323147) I do not know who else will look after them with the loving care of Chhotelal.
('72', 181, 1, 20, 323226) For, Chhotelal had literally become apiculture mad.
('72', 181, 1, 21, 323278) In the course of his quest he had contracted paratyphoid fever which had a fatal ending.
('72', 181, 1, 22, 323367) He had been bed ridden for hardly six or seven days, but the very thought of being a helpless charge upon others evidently ate into him, and on Tuesday night, the 31st of August, leaving everybody asleep, he put an end to his life by throwing himself into the Maganwadi well.
('72', 181, 1, 23, 323643) The corpse was recovered from the well today, Wednesday, at 4 p.
('72', 181, 1, 24, 323708) and even as I pen these lines at Segaon, at 8 p.
('72', 181, 1, 25, 323757) m., his body is being cremated at Wardha.
('72', 181, 1, 26, 323799) I have not the heart to rebuke Chhotelal for his suicide.
('72', 181, 1, 27, 323857) He was no coward.
('72', 181, 1, 28, 323875) He was guilty of no unworthy deed.
('72', 181, 1, 29, 323910) He could laugh at

('72', 182, 1, 2, 324032) suffering.
('72', 182, 1, 3, 324043) I cannot account for this self immolation except on the supposition that he could no longer brook to be nursed.
('72', 182, 1, 4, 324155) No doubt that is a sign of subtle pride.
('72', 182, 1, 5, 324196) But there it was.
('72', 182, 1, 6, 324214) He was not conscious of it.
('72', 182, 1, 7, 324242) His name figured in the Delhi Conspiracy Case of 1915. He was acquitted.
('72', 182, 1, 8, 324315) He had told me he did not desire acquittal.
('72', 182, 1, 9, 324359) A casual reading of some of my writings gave a new turn to his life and outlook.
('72', 182, 1, 10, 324440) He studied my activities in South Africa, and from a violent revolutionary became a votary of ahimsa.
('72', 182, 1, 11, 324542) He shed his cult of violence as completely and naturally as a snake does its outworn skin, but he could never completely control the proneness to anger and pride that were deeply ingrained in his nature.
('72', 182, 1, 12, 324746) Did he expiate with his life for these?
('72', 182, 1, 13, 324786) By his death (he was 42 1) he has left me heavily in his debt.
('72', 182, 1, 14, 324849) I had entertained high hopes of him.
('72', 182, 1, 15, 324886) I could not tolerate any imperfection in him and so he had often to bear the brunt of my impatience as, perhaps, only one or two besides him have borne.
('72', 182, 1, 16, 325039) But he never complained, never even winced.
('72', 182, 1, 17, 325083) Had I any right to put him through this fire as I used to?
('72', 182, 1, 18, 325142) I had hoped one day to discharge my debt towards him by offering him as a sacrifice at the altar of Hindu Muslim unity, untouchability or cow protection.
('72', 182, 1, 19, 325296) To my mind these are some of the altars in the great yajna of the swaraj of my dream.
('72', 182, 1, 20, 325382) And Chhotelal was in the front rank of the few who, to my knowledge, had the strength and capacity to claim this privilege.
('72', 182, 1, 21, 325506) The country needs an army of silent warriors like him.
('72', 182, 1, 22, 325561) The achievement of swaraj, which to me is synonymous with Ramaraj, is no joke.
('72', 182, 1, 23, 325640) Let these few glimpses of Chhotelal’s life serve as an inspiration in our striving for India’s freedom.

('72', 183, 3, 4, 326127) MAHADEV, Today we all waited eagerly for the car for a long time.
('72', 183, 3, 5, 326193) We expected it every moment.
('72', 183, 3, 6, 326222) But it didn’t turn up.
('72', 183, 3, 7, 326245) At last I thought that perhaps you might have forgotten about it because I could tell you only at the last minute when you were leaving.
('72', 183, 3, 8, 326382) But it doesn’t matter.
('72', 183, 3, 9, 326405) Now either send or bring, a cart or a car tomorrow.
('72', 183, 3, 10, 326457) If you are arranging for a cart, then it would be better if it comes empty.
('72', 183, 3, 11, 326533) Gosibehn wants to reach Wardha today at two o’clock in the afternoon.
('72', 183, 3, 12, 326603) The car, therefore, should be sent for her.
('72', 183, 3, 13, 326647) Just now the doctor and Chimanlal have come in the cart.
('72', 183, 3, 14, 326704) The cart.
('72', 183, 3, 15, 326714) will take the doctor back to Wardha.
('72', 183, 3, 16, 326751) If, therefore, the cart has to come again in the afternoon, it will be hard on the bullocks.
('72', 183, 3, 17, 326844) I am writing to Damodar about this.
('72', 183, 3, 18, 326880) He will, therefore, make the arrangements for today.
('72', 183, 3, 19, 326933) You needn’t do anything about it.
('72', 183, 3, 20, 326967) I have written this in order that if you or anybody else wishes to come here, you may ascertain from the bungalow the time when the car will be leaving so that you can get a lift.

('72', 184, 14, 22, 328254) We take this opportunity to convey through you our appeal to all sufferers in jails and detention camps, and to all organizations if there be any who still believe to attain independence of India through terrorism, to give it up, once for all.
('72', 184, 14, 23, 328498) We further request you to clarify what you mean by ‘relief’.
('72', 184, 14, 24, 328559) We think after Government inaugurating provincial autonomy, relief can only mean release of all political prisoners, detenus, State prisoners, interners, removal of ban on exiles and repeal of all repressive laws.
('72', 184, 14, 25, 328773) If we get assurance from you on these questions, we can suspend hunger strike.

('72', 185, 3, 4, 329282) MAHADEV, When I received your letter it was time for me to take my bath.
('72', 185, 3, 5, 329355) I am, therefore, writing this after finishing the daily morning routine.
('72', 185, 3, 6, 329428) Shahji has had his meal here.
('72', 185, 3, 7, 329458) The mistake which occurred about the car today is bound to occur occasionally.
('72', 185, 3, 8, 329537) It was good that today’s trip was not so important.
('72', 185, 3, 9, 329589) I assume that the car will definitely come tomorrow.

('72', 185, 3, 14, 329872) For the present preserve Chhotelal’s ashes in a box.
('72', 185, 3, 15, 329925) I am [not] at all inclined to send them as far as the Ganga, nor to have them immersed even in the liver Paunar.
('72', 185, 3, 16, 330038) But I don’t wish that they should be thrown away either.
('72', 185, 3, 17, 330095) Ba says that his father may, perhaps, wish to have them immersed.
('72', 185, 3, 18, 330161) This seems likely.
('72', 185, 3, 19, 330180) From that point of view also, it is better to preserve the ashes in a box.

('72', 186, 8, 13, 331712) The effect on the sufferers does not vary with the motive of the authors of violence.
('72', 186, 8, 14, 331798) But as an out and out believer in non violence I do not believe in the system of punishments for crimes, whether private or public.
('72', 186, 8, 15, 331930) Therefore, I should welcome an extension of the principle which guides the Ministers in discharging prisoners; but I am aware that they do not share my extreme views on non violence.
('72', 186, 8, 16, 332113) Their reason, therefore, for discharging the prisoners condemned for violence is not the same as I would apply.
('72', 186, 8, 17, 332225) They have been guided, naturally and rightly, by the purely political motive, viz., to establish contact with those who have hitherto believed in the efficacy of a species of violence for the attainment of India’s freedom.
('72', 186, 8, 18, 332448) They want to wean these men from violence and harness their energy for the Congress method of non violence.
('72', 186, 8, 19, 332556) If my reading of the Congress method is correct, the large public demonstration that took place on the discharge of Kakori prisoners was, to say the least, a political mistake.
('72', 186, 8, 20, 332733) Did the thousands of demonstrators approve of the
('72', 187, 0, 1, 332783) 188 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 187, 1, 2, 332825) acts said to have been committed by these prisoners, let me hope, in mistaken zeal?
('72', 187, 1, 3, 332909) If they did, they have evidently not understood the Congress method; what is more, they have embarrassed the Ministry and made more difficult the task of giving the fullest liberty to the people in their Provinces.
('72', 187, 1, 4, 333124) We ought to learn to take such ministerial acts as in the natural course and, therefore, with calmness.
('72', 187, 1, 5, 333228) Kakori prisoners are no fools.
('72', 187, 1, 6, 333259) They are able, intelligent men, with unyielding love of their country.
('72', 187, 1, 7, 333330) They and all such prisoners will pave the way for the liberty of others, if they use their liberty to help Congress Ministers by their exemplary conduct and by proving themselves true Congressmen, taking their full share in strengthening the Congress organization by silent and selfless service.
('72', 187, 1, 8, 333626) For they should know that Congress Ministers seem to be having their own way in many matters because they have inspired the respective Governors with confidence in their ability to handle efficiently all the departments under their charge, especially that of law and order, without the intervention of the police and military.
('72', 187, 1, 9, 333953) The moment they lose their credit in this respect and are obliged to fall back on these two so called limbs of the law, the confidence will be weakened and their authority all but gone.
('72', 187, 1, 10, 334139) Whilst power, superimposed, always needs the help of police and military, power generated from within should have little or no use for them.
('72', 187, 1, 11, 334280) GAMBLING AND VICE
('72', 187, 2, 12, 334298) In the provinces where the Congress has a majority, all kinds of hopes have been raised.
('72', 187, 2, 13, 334387) Some are legitimate and will, no doubt, be fulfilled.
('72', 187, 2, 14, 334441) Some others cannot be.
('72', 187, 2, 15, 334464) Thus the people who indulge in gambling, which unfortunately is ever on the increase in the Bombay Presidency, think that gambling will be legalized and surreptitious dens that cover Bombay will be no longer required.
('72', 187, 2, 16, 334682) I am not quite sure that even if gambling is legalized on a universal scale, as it is already in a restricted manner, there will be no illegal dens.
('72', 187, 2, 17, 334831) Thus it has been suggested that the Turf Club, which has the monopoly of gambling on the racecourse, should be allowed to open an additional entrance to make it easier for poor people to gamble.
('72', 187, 2, 18, 335026) The bait offered is a larger revenue.
('72', 187, 2, 19, 335064) A similar suggestion has been made for the regulation and licensing of brothels.
('72', 187, 2, 20, 335145) The argument advanced, as in all such cases, is that the vice will continue whether it is legalized or not and, therefore, it is better to legalize it and make it safe for those who visit the brothels.
('72', 187, 2, 21, 335347) Let me hope that the Ministers will not fall into this
('72', 188, 0, 1, 335402) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 189
('72', 188, 1, 2, 335446) The proper method of dealing with brothels is for the women to carry on a double propaganda, (a) amongst women who sell their honour for a livelihood and (b) amongst men whom they must shame into behaving better towards their sisters whom they ignorantly or insolently call the weaker sex.
('72', 188, 1, 3, 335736) I remember years and years ago in the early nineties when the brave Salvation Army people, at the risk of their own lives, used to carry on picketing at the corners of notorious streets of Bombay which were filled with houses of ill fame.
('72', 188, 1, 4, 335975) There is no reason why some such thing should not be organized on a large scale.
('72', 188, 1, 5, 336056) As for gambling on the racecourse, it is, so far as I am aware, an importation, like many other importations, from the West, and if I had my way [I] would withdraw the protection of the law that gambling on the racecourse enjoys even to the extent it does.
('72', 188, 1, 6, 336313) The Congress programme being one of self purification, as is stated in so many words in the resolution 1 of 1920, the Congress can have nothing to do with income derived from any vice.
('72', 188, 1, 7, 336498) The Ministers will, therefore, use the authority that they have obtained for educating public opinion in the right direction and for stopping gambling in high quarters.
('72', 188, 1, 8, 336667) It is useless to hope that the unwary public will not copy the bad manners of the so called high placed people.
('72', 188, 1, 9, 336779) I have heard it argued that horse racing is necessary for breeding good horses.
('72', 188, 1, 10, 336859) There may be truth in this.
('72', 188, 1, 11, 336887) Is it not possible to have horse racing without gambling, or is gambling also an aid to the good breeding of horses?

('72', 188, 3, 14, 337059) Shri Shankerrao Deo 2 writes:
('72', 188, 4, 15, 337089) In your note “Not Instrument of Instructions” 3 in the last Harijan, you say in the second paragraph, “For me office acceptance has a special meaning even in the terms of the Congress manifesto and resolutions.
('72', 188, 4, 16, 337300) It would be wrong if I did not put before the Ministers and the public my meaning of office acceptance.” As I have understood you, you arefor office acceptance for serving the masses and consolidating the Congress position through constructive programme.
('72', 188, 4, 17, 337555) But I think you should explain in greater detail your meaning of office acceptance.
('72', 188, 5, 18, 337639) 1 Vide “ Congress Resolution on Non Co Operation” 2 President, Maharashtra Provincial Congress Committee 3 Vide “Notes”, sub title”Not Instrument of Instructions”
('72', 189, 0, 1, 337802) 190 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 189, 1, 2, 337844) Rightly or wrongly, since 1920 the Congress minded millions have firmly held the view that the British domination of India has been on the whole a curse.
('72', 189, 1, 3, 337998) It has been as much sustained by British arms as it has been through the legislatures, distribution of titles, the law courts, the educational institutions, the financial policy and the like.
('72', 189, 1, 4, 338190) The Congress came to the conclusion that the guns should not be feared, but that the organized violence of which the British guns were a naked emblem should be met by the organized non violence of the people, and the legislatures and the rest by non co operating with them.
('72', 189, 1, 5, 338464) There was a strong and effective, positive side to the foregoing plan of non co operation, which became known as the constructive programme.
('72', 189, 1, 6, 338605) The nation succeeded to the exact extent of its success in the programme of action laid down in 1920. Now this policy has never changed; not even the terms have been revoked by the Congress.
('72', 189, 1, 7, 338796) In my opinion all the resolutions since passed by the Congress are not a repudiation but a fulfilment of the original, so long as the mentality behind all of them remains the same as in 1920. The corner stone of the policy of 1920 was organized national non violence.
('72', 189, 1, 8, 339064) The British system was wooden, even Satanic; not so the men and women behind the system.
('72', 189, 1, 9, 339153) Our non violence, therefore, meant that we were out to convert the administrators of the system, not to destroy them; the conversion may or may not be willing.
('72', 189, 1, 10, 339313) If, notwithstanding their desire to the contrary, they saw that their guns and everything they had created for the consolidation of their authority were useless because of our non use of them, they could not do otherwise than bow to the inevitable and either retire from the scene, or remain on our terms, i.
('72', 189, 1, 11, 339622) e., as friends to co operate with us, not as rulers to impose their will upon us.
('72', 189, 1, 12, 339704) If Congressmen have entered the legislatures and have accepted office with that mentality, and if the British administrators tolerate Congress Ministries indefinitely, the Congress will be on a fair way to wreck the Act 1 and to achieve complete independence.
('72', 189, 1, 13, 339964) For an indefinite prolongation of the Ministries on the terms mentioned by me means an ever increasing power of the Congress till it becomes irresistible and is able to have its way all along the line.
('72', 189, 1, 14, 340166) The first indispensable condition of the attainment of such a consummation
('72', 189, 2, 15, 340241) 1 Government of India Act of 1935
('72', 190, 0, 1, 340275) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 191
('72', 190, 1, 2, 340319) means willing exercise of non violence by the whole mass of the people.
('72', 190, 1, 3, 340391) That means perfect communal co operation and friendship, the eradication of untouchability, willing restraint of the addicts to the drink and opium habits, the social enfranchisement of women, the progressive amelioration of the toiling millions in the villages, free and compulsory primary education—not in name as it is today, but in reality, as I have ventured to adumbrate—the gradual eradication of superstitions of proved harmfulness through adult mass education, a complete overhauling of the system of higher education so as to answer the wants of the millions instead of the few middle class people, a radical change in the legal machinery so as to make justice pure and inexpensive, conversion of jails into reformatories in which detention would be not a course of punishment but a complete course of the education of those miscalled convicts but who are in fact temporarily deranged.
('72', 190, 1, 4, 341287) This is not conceived as a terribly long plan of action.
('72', 190, 1, 5, 341344) Every one of the items suggested by me can be put into motion today, without let or hindrance, if we have the will.
('72', 190, 1, 6, 341460) I had not studied the Act when I advised office acceptance.
('72', 190, 1, 7, 341520) I have since been studying Provincial Autonomy by Prof.
('72', 190, 1, 8, 341576) K. T. Shah.
('72', 190, 1, 9, 341588) It is an energetic but true indictment of the Act from the orthodox standpoint.
('72', 190, 1, 10, 341668) But the three months’ self denial of the Congress has changed the atmosphere.
('72', 190, 1, 11, 341746) I see nothing in the Act to prevent the Congress Ministers from undertaking the programme suggested by me.
('72', 190, 1, 12, 341853) The special powers and safeguards come into play only when there is violence in the country, or a clash between minorities and the so called majority community, which is another word for violence.
('72', 190, 1, 13, 342050) I detect in the Act a profound distrust of the nation’s capacity to rule itself running through every Section and an inevitable desire to perpetuate British rule, but at the same time a bold experiment of wooing the masses to the British side, and, failing that, a resignation to their will to reject British domination.
('72', 190, 1, 14, 342371) The Congress has gone in to convert these missionaries.
('72', 190, 1, 15, 342427) And I have not a shadow of doubt that if the Congress is true to the spirit of non violence, non co operation and self purification, it will succeed in its mission.

('72', 191, 2, 3, 342682) A friend writes: 2
('72', 191, 3, 4, 342701) In accordance with President Jawaharlal’s instructions Cawnpore
('72', 191, 4, 5, 342765) observed the 1st of August as a National Flag Day and national flags were
('72', 191, 5, 6, 342839) flown from all parts of the city.
('72', 191, 5, 7, 342873) But these flags were manufactured anyhow by
('72', 191, 6, 8, 342917) the individuals concerned according to their whims without any regard .
('72', 191, 7, 9, 342989) uniformity of size, shape or colour.
('72', 191, 7, 10, 343026) Some of the flags had the figure of the
('72', 191, 8, 11, 343066) spinning wheel printed on them; in others it was conspicuous by its absence.
('72', 191, 9, 12, 343143) Today, after the lapse of a fortnight, most of these flags present a sorry
('72', 191, 10, 13, 343218) spectacle.
('72', 191, 10, 14, 343229) I would, therefore, suggest that arrangements should be made to
('72', 191, 11, 15, 343293) see that only flags of standard sizes, shape and colour are manufactured.
('72', 191, 12, 16, 343367) It seems to me that this can be effectively done only by bringing the
('72', 191, 13, 17, 343437) manufacture and sale of national flags under a centralized control.
('72', 191, 13, 18, 343505) If the facts are as described by my correspondent, it calls for serious thought.
('72', 191, 13, 19, 343586) We have been using this flag for the last seventeen years.
('72', 191, 13, 20, 343645) 3 A national flag would lose all its value if it did not strictly conform to the standard laid down.
('72', 191, 13, 21, 343746) Even in the matter of ordinary articles we like to satisfy ourselves as to their size, shape, colour, etc., before we go in for them.
('72', 191, 13, 22, 343880) How much more so must it be, then, with our national flag for which we are pledged to live and die?
('72', 191, 13, 23, 343980) The national flag symbolizes a nation’s self respect and dignity its ideals and aspirations.
('72', 191, 13, 24, 344073) It must, therefore, be capable of easy identification like coins.
('72', 191, 13, 25, 344139) Only the strictest conformity to the standard specifications can invest it with the desired sanctity.
('72', 191, 13, 26, 344241) It should hurt our sense of national pride and self respect to use a flag that is slipshod or slovenly made.
('72', 191, 13, 27, 344350) How can a flag that is a mere clout and is dyed anyhow evoke the feelings of deep reverence that one associates with a national flag?
('72', 191, 13, 28, 344484) I am, therefore, in entire agreement with my correspondent that our national flag should be strictly standardized.
('72', 191, 13, 29, 344599) And this can be best done by having its manufacture centralized as coins are in mint.
('72', 191, 13, 30, 344685) In my opinion the All India Spinners’ Association, working under theguidance of the All India Congress Committee, would be the fittest

('72', 194, 1, 4, 348115) The hand of God is sure to be there in a great task such as the Congress and even possible human failures are got over.
('72', 194, 1, 5, 348235) The forthcoming Congress should be so organized from now on that there should be no error which human endeavour can avoid and everything should come off as planned.

('72', 194, 3, 8, 348467) SEGAON, WARDHA, September 5, 1937
('72', 194, 4, 9, 348501) MY DEAR GLADYS, I like your idea of throwing yourself heart and soul into the Chinese movement.
('72', 194, 4, 10, 348597) But I do not know how I can give the lead.
('72', 194, 4, 11, 348640) No external power can guide you.
('72', 194, 4, 12, 348673) The direction and the strength have to come from within.
('72', 194, 4, 13, 348730) I have just heard from Muriel 1. She too wants me to do something for China.
('72', 194, 4, 14, 348807) I must confess that I am fairly groping.
('72', 194, 4, 15, 348848) China wants to give battle to Japan on her own ground.
('72', 194, 4, 16, 348903) And in this kind of business I am totally at sea.
('72', 194, 4, 17, 348953) I do not know how the message of non violence can be delivered to China as I do not know how it can be delivered to Spain.
('72', 194, 4, 18, 349076) My theatre of action is, therefore, only India.
('72', 194, 4, 19, 349124) If India imbibes the message through and through, then there is hope for whole world.
('72', 194, 4, 20, 349210) If India does not, so far as I can see, a world catastrophe cannot be prevented.

('72', 200, 14, 24, 357336) He says it has never failed to give lasting relief.
('72', 200, 14, 25, 357388) It can do no harm.
('72', 200, 14, 26, 357407) Of course it deprives me of one food

('72', 201, 1, 23, 358792) If my ahimsa is worth anything, surely it ought to resist all temptation and provocation.
('72', 201, 1, 24, 358882) Please don’t defend me but go for me.
('72', 201, 1, 25, 358920) If Lilavati is lost to me, I shall be largely to blame.
('72', 201, 1, 26, 358976) She is too good not to return to me.

('72', 202, 2, 3, 359544) [September 8, 1937] 1
('72', 202, 3, 4, 359566) MAHADEV, Send half a maund, or even one maund, of dates with anybody who is available.
('72', 202, 3, 5, 359653) We should get three dozen mosambis and two dozen bananas daily.
('72', 202, 3, 6, 359717) I send with this a wire for Rajkumari.
('72', 202, 3, 7, 359756) The one to Andrews must have been dispatched.
('72', 202, 3, 8, 359802) The wire received from the seven prisoners does not seem to have been given to the Press.
('72', 202, 3, 9, 359892) If possible give it now together with my reply to it.
('72', 202, 3, 10, 359946) I am afraid we have delayed it rather too long.
('72', 202, 3, 11, 359994) I have kept copies of the wires.
('72', 202, 3, 12, 360027) Have the wire of these seven prisoners and my reply been released?
('72', 202, 3, 13, 360094) A painful incident took place this morning.
('72', 202, 3, 14, 360138) Lilavati has always been a lazy girl.
('72', 202, 3, 15, 360176) She is careless, suffers from no end of pride and can bear nothing.
('72', 202, 3, 16, 360244) The incident was trivial.
('72', 202, 3, 17, 360270) Nanavati drew her attention to her carelessness, which she couldn’t bear.
('72', 202, 3, 18, 360344) Nanavati reported the incident to me.
('72', 202, 3, 19, 360382) I was busy with my own work and was trying to avoid having to take notice of it.
('72', 202, 3, 20, 360463) I had said a few words half jokingly, when the lady sailed in.
('72', 202, 3, 21, 360526) She emphasized each sentence as she spoke, and that at the top of her voice.
('72', 202, 3, 22, 360603) I asked her to speak calmly.
('72', 202, 3, 23, 360632) But she wouldn’t listen.
('72', 202, 3, 24, 360657) She then started saying silly things.
('72', 202, 3, 25, 360695) And so I said, raising my voice, “There is no door here—the only one there is open.
('72', 202, 3, 26, 360779) If you can’t stand it, you may leave.” I had lost my senses while I said this and so barked even louder than she.
('72', 202, 3, 27, 360893) She has now left.
('72', 202, 3, 28, 360911) Where else would she go, except to the temple of Mahadev?
('72', 202, 3, 29, 360969) She must have, therefore, come to you.
('72', 202, 3, 30, 361008) If she realizes that she has been cruel to me, shame her into returning here.
('72', 202, 3, 31, 361086) If she doesn’t realize the gravity of her misbehaviour, she may do as she pleases.
('72', 202, 3, 32, 361169) She has no place in the Harijan Ashram.
('72', 202, 3, 33, 361209) She shouldn’t be sent there.
('72', 202, 3, 34, 361238) You may, if you wish, take her under your charge.

('72', 203, 3, 4, 361685) MAHADEV, Do send back Lilavati.
('72', 203, 3, 5, 361717) She must have gone to the doctor, since a visit was due today.
('72', 203, 3, 6, 361780) I had nothing private to speak to you.
('72', 203, 3, 7, 361819) But it was good that you saved your time.
('72', 203, 3, 8, 361861) It was not Lilavati’s fault, but mine, that you had to give some of your time for her.
('72', 203, 3, 9, 361948) Had I remained silent she woudn’t have had to leave this place.
('72', 203, 3, 10, 362012) It was your fault that you lost your sleep, for in such cases you should remain undisturbed.
('72', 203, 3, 11, 362105) Kanu junior 2 has fallen ill today after a long interval.

('72', 204, 3, 4, 362974) NIMU, I got your letter yesterday.
('72', 204, 3, 5, 363009) Replying immediately would have meant my delaying the posting of the other letters.
('72', 204, 3, 6, 363093) I therefore put off writing to this morning.
('72', 204, 3, 7, 363138) I am glad I dictated the Gurukul’s correct address.
('72', 204, 3, 8, 363190) I will await a letter from you after you have settled down there.
('72', 204, 3, 9, 363256) Do not be lazy in writing.
('72', 204, 3, 10, 363283) Kano had forgotten you quite soon, or at any rate seemed to have done so.
('72', 204, 3, 11, 363357) One cannot say anything certain about him.
('72', 204, 3, 12, 363400) About constipation, follow what Saraswati has suggested to you.
('72', 204, 3, 13, 363464) I have of course heard from many that one should not take milk with bread, but so far I have not acted upon it.
('72', 204, 3, 14, 363576) But at any rate you should try to put it into practice and see whether doing so helps.
('72', 204, 3, 15, 363663) Inquire how much fruit, milk, vegetables, flour etc., cost there.
('72', 204, 3, 16, 363729) Do they buy flour in the.
('72', 204, 3, 17, 363755) market, or do they have a flour mill?
('72', 204, 3, 18, 363793) Are there any girls of Sumi’s age?
('72', 204, 3, 19, 363828) Do they run any industry?
('72', 204, 3, 20, 363854) Do they have music?
('72', 204, 3, 21, 363874) Did you leave Delhi the same day or after staying for a day or two?

('72', 204, 8, 27, 364124) [Before September 11, 1937] [GANDHIJI:] It is by making the children return to the State a part of what they receive from it that I propose to make education self supporting.
('72', 204, 8, 28, 364299) I should combine into one what you call now the primary education and [the] secondary or high school education.
('72', 204, 8, 29, 364411) It is my conviction that our children get nothing more in the high schools than a half baked knowledge of English, besides a superficial
('72', 204, 9, 30, 364548) 1 Extracted from Mahadev Desai’s article “The Meaning of Manual Work”.
('72', 204, 9, 31, 364619) Ravishanker Shukla, Education Minister, C. P., met Gandhiji with his educational experts including the Director of Education, Owen, and De Silva.
('72', 204, 9, 32, 364765) They wanted to understand from Gandhiji his idea of the revolution he intended to bring about in the system of education.
('72', 205, 0, 1, 364887) 206 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 205, 1, 2, 364929) knowledge of mathematics and history and geography some of which they had learnt in their own language in the primary classes.
('72', 205, 1, 3, 365056) If you cut out English from the curriculum altogether, without cutting out the subjects you teach, you can make the children go through the whole course in seven years, instead of eleven, besides giving them manual work whereby they can make a fair return to the State.
('72', 205, 1, 4, 365326) Manual work will have to be the very centre of the whole thing.
('72', 205, 1, 5, 365390) I am told that Messrs Abbot 1 and Wood recognize the value of manual work as an important part of rural education.
('72', 205, 1, 6, 365505) I am glad to be supported by reputed educationists.
('72', 205, 1, 7, 365557) But I do not suppose they place on manual work the kind of emphasis I place.
('72', 205, 1, 8, 365634) For I say that the development of the mind should come through manual training.
('72', 205, 1, 9, 365714) The manual training will not consist in producing articles for a school museum, or toys which have no value.
('72', 205, 1, 10, 365823) It should produce marketable articles.
('72', 205, 1, 11, 365862) The children will not do this as children used to do under the whip in the early days of the factories.
('72', 205, 1, 12, 365966) They will do it because it entertains them and stimulates their intellect.
('72', 205, 2, 13, 366041) [DE SILVA:] But whilst I accept the proposition that we must teach through creative work, how can we expect an immature child to compete with a mature individual?
('72', 205, 2, 14, 366204) The child will not compete with the mature individual.
('72', 205, 2, 15, 366259) The State will take over the articles and find a market for them.
('72', 205, 2, 16, 366325) Teach them to make things suitable for the requirements.
('72', 205, 2, 17, 366382) Take mats for instance.
('72', 205, 2, 18, 366406) What they do at home as tedious labour they will do here intelligenty.
('72', 205, 2, 19, 366477) The tremendous problem will become easy when the education you give will become both self supporting and self acting.
('72', 205, 3, 20, 366595) But before we can give them this kind of education, we shall have to wipe out the present generation of teachers.
('72', 205, 3, 21, 366709) There is no intermediate stage.
('72', 205, 3, 22, 366741) You must make a start and prepare the teachers whilst you go through the process.

('72', 206, 1, 2, 367066) 280. ARE CHRISTIANS AGAINST PROHIBITION?
('72', 206, 2, 3, 367107) Having received protests from Christian correspondents against prohibition, I asked Mahadev Desai to write to a few representative Christian friends to ascertain their views on the question.
('72', 206, 2, 4, 367298) Here are two answers.
('72', 206, 2, 5, 367320) Shri P. O. Phillip, Indian Secretary of the National Christian Council of India, writes: 1
('72', 206, 3, 6, 367411) I am not surprised to hear that a number of Christian friends are writing to you to say that ‘the policy of prohibition trenches upon their privilege to drink’.
('72', 206, 3, 7, 367572) I may not be far wrong in thinking that most of the correspondents who write to you in that strain are Roman Catholics or those brought up in Anglo Catholic traditions.
('72', 206, 3, 8, 367741) There is .
('72', 206, 3, 9, 367752) no social or religious disapproval among Roman Catholics in India in regard to drinking in moderation as there is among Muslims and higher caste Hindus.
('72', 206, 3, 10, 367905) Among Protestant Christians the attitude toward drink is different.
('72', 206, 4, 11, 367973) The use of alcoholic drink even in moderation is looked upon with social and religious disapprobation among Protestant Christian communities.
('72', 206, 5, 12, 368115) Among Roman Catholics also there is awakening to the evils of drink.
('72', 206, 5, 13, 368184) While the authorities of the Catholic Church may officially maintain that there is nothing wrong in drinking in moderation, they cannot shut their eyes to the moral and economic ruin that drink is causing among their people.
('72', 206, 5, 14, 368409) As a Christian Indian I rejoice that the Congress Ministries have placed prohibition in the very forefront of their programme.
('72', 206, 5, 15, 368536) In the past, few British and American missionaries lent support to the anti drink campaign of the Congress, under the mistaken notion that it was adopted only to harass the British Government and not from a genuine desire for reform.
('72', 206, 5, 16, 368770) Unfortunately Indian Christians also took their cue from the missionaries and generally kept aloof from the movement.
('72', 206, 5, 17, 368888) But the sincerity of the leaders of the Congress in advocating prohibition is beyond question.
('72', 206, 6, 18, 368983) The poorer classes in the villages, including Christians, need protection more than any other group of people from the temptations of drink now placed before them.
('72', 206, 6, 19, 369147) Indian villages will have new life and prosperity when drink is abolished.
('72', 206, 6, 20, 369222) The Christian Indian community along with other communities stands to gain immensely by this measure.
('72', 206, 7, 21, 369324) Christian Indians who love India and care for the real welfare of the

('72', 207, 1, 2, 369489) rural masses cannot but rejoice at the prospect of prohibition in the six Provinces 1. They should not have any difficulty in wholeheartedly co operating with their fellow countrymen in making prohibition a complete success.

('72', 207, 1, 4, 369723) A. Ralla Ram, General Secretary of the Student Christian Movement of India, Burma and Ceylon, writes:
('72', 207, 2, 5, 369825) I give my full support to the objective of the Congress to bring about complete prohibition in the country and that those who are asking that we should be satisfied with temperance should not be listened to.
('72', 207, 2, 6, 370033) In my opinion the Europeans who come to this country should fall in with our aspirations, and I am afraid that if we should respect their feelings in this matter, we shall leave a loophole for many others.
('72', 207, 2, 7, 370239) As I have said before 2 it is for Europeans to make the choice.
('72', 207, 2, 8, 370303) I know how difficult it is for them to give up a habit of a lifetime, considered respectable.
('72', 207, 2, 9, 370397) But if they will fall in with the great national reform, the incentive should prove strong enough to wean them from the habit.
('72', 207, 2, 10, 370524) Anyway, even if in the end exemption within well defined limits has to be given, let us hope that they will be graceful enough to taboo alcohol from their parties and banquets.
('72', 207, 2, 11, 370701) Exemption will be, if there is to be, a concession to a lifelong habit and not to a weakness or to an extravagance.

('72', 207, 4, 14, 370847) A WELCOME MOVE The joint statement issued by Moulvi Abdul Haq Saheb and Shri Rajendra Prasad over the Hindi Urdu controversy leads one to hope that the controversy will now end and those who are interested in the evolution of an inter provincial speech will be able to discuss the question on its merits and discover a plan of joint action.
('72', 207, 4, 15, 371188) Here is the statement:
('72', 207, 5, 16, 371211) We had an opportunity, on the occasion of the meeting of the Bihar Urdu Committee at Patna on 28 8 37, to discuss the problem of the Hindustani language with each other and with some other friends.
('72', 207, 5, 17, 371409) We were anxious to

('72', 208, 1, 2, 371650) remove the misunderstandings which have been unfortunately created in connection with the Urdu Hindi Hindustani controversy.
('72', 208, 1, 3, 371775) We are glad to be able to say that as a result of our discussions ranging over various aspects of this problem, we found ourselves in substantial agreement about various points raised.
('72', 208, 1, 4, 371960) We are agreed that Hindustani should be the common language of India and should be written in both the Urdu and [the] Nagari characters which should be recognized for all official and educational purposes.
('72', 208, 1, 5, 372166) By ‘Hindustani’ we mean the largest common factor of the languages spoken in Northern India, and we believe that common usage should be the criterion for the selection and inclusion of words in its vocabulary.
('72', 208, 1, 6, 372376) We are further of opinion that the fullest opportunities for development should be vouchsafed both to Urdu and Hindi and [the] literary languages.
('72', 208, 1, 7, 372523) We suggest that an attempt should be made to compile, through the co operation of Urdu and Hindi scholars, a basic vocabulary of Hindustani words.
('72', 208, 2, 8, 372670) In order to devise practical measures for the compilation of such a vocabulary as well as for settling various outstanding problems like the selection of technical terms, we suggest that a small representative committee, consisting of influential advocates of Urdu and Hindi who believe in the desirability of bringing the two languages nearer and of promoting the development of the Hindustani language and thereby creating goodwill amongst the speakers of the two languages, should be convened at an early date.
('72', 208, 2, 9, 373184) Let us hope that the authors of the statement will take prompt steps to have the basic vocabulary of Hindustani words acceptable to all parties, and that the small committee they have in view will be set up forthwith for this work and for “settling various outstanding problems”.
('72', 208, 2, 10, 373464) I would put emphasis on the smallness of the committee if promptness is to be ensured.
('72', 208, 3, 11, 373551) MUSIC IN SCHOOLS Pandit Khare 1 of Gandharva Mahavidyalaya, who has dedicated his life to the spread of pure music among boys and girls, reports the great progress being made in Ahmedabad in particular and Gujarat in general, and he deplores the fact that the education authorities do not seem to countenance the introduction of music in the curricula of education.
('72', 208, 3, 12, 373917) In the Pandit’s opinion, based upon wide experience, it should form part of the syllabus of primary education.
('72', 208, 3, 13, 374028) I heartily endorse the proposition.

('72', 209, 1, 3, 374205) Physical drill, handicrafts, drawing and music should go hand in hand in order to draw the best out of the boys and girls and create in them a real interest in their tuition.
('72', 209, 1, 4, 374380) That this means a revolution in the system of training is admitted.
('72', 209, 1, 5, 374448) If the future citizens of the State are to build a sure foundation for life’s work, these four things are necessary.
('72', 209, 1, 6, 374565) One has only to visit any primary school to have a striking demonstration of slovenliness, disorderliness and discordant speech.
('72', 209, 1, 7, 374694) I have no doubt, therefore, that when the Education Ministers in the several provinces recast the system of education and make it answer the requirements of the country, they will not omit the essentials to which I have drawn attention.
('72', 209, 1, 8, 374931) My plan of primary education certainly comprises these things which easily become possible the moment you remove from the children’s shoulders the burden of having to master a difficult foreign language.
('72', 209, 1, 9, 375135) Of course, we have not the staff of teachers who can cope with the new method.
('72', 209, 1, 10, 375214) But that difficulty applies to every new venture.
('72', 209, 1, 11, 375264) The existing staff of teachers, if they are willing to learn, should be given the opportunity of doing so, and should also have the immediate prospect of a substantial increase in their salaries if they will learn the necessary subjects.
('72', 209, 1, 12, 375502) It is unthinkable that for all the new subjects that are to become part of primary education separate teachers should be provided.
('72', 209, 1, 13, 375633) That would be a most expensive method and so wholly unnecessary.
('72', 209, 1, 14, 375698) It may be that some of the primary school teachers are so ill equipped that they cannot learn the new subjects within a short time.
('72', 209, 1, 15, 375830) But a boy who has studied up to the matriculation standard should not take more than three months to learn the elements of music, drawing, physical drill and a handicraft.
('72', 209, 1, 16, 376002) If he acquires a working knowledge of these, he will be able always to add to it while he is teaching.
('72', 209, 1, 17, 376105) This presupposes, no doubt, eagerness and zeal on the part of the teachers to make themselves progressively fit for the task of national regeneration.
('72', 209, 2, 18, 376256) A MONSTROUS IMPOSITION In a note 1 in Harijanbandhu, recently, I reproduced a note from a correspondent saying that there were money lenders in and around Sidhpur in the Gaekwar territories who lent money at exorbitant rates of interest and exacted security for due payment of capital and interest.
('72', 209, 2, 19, 376555) The money lenders, among other things, had a lien on the young girls of the borrowers.
('72', 209, 2, 20, 376642) The result of this shameful imposition

('72', 210, 1, 2, 376765) has been that sometimes parents have been obliged to part with their girls when they have not been able to pay interest ranging from 100 per cent upwards.
('72', 210, 1, 3, 376920) I understand that some workers have brought this thing to the notice of the district officers of Sidhpur, but nothing seems to have been visibly done in the matter.
('72', 210, 1, 4, 377085) If the facts are as stated by my correspondent— and there seems to be no cause to disbelieve him—the matter demands immediate redress.

('72', 210, 2, 6, 377239) 282. SELF SUPPORTING EDUCATION
('72', 210, 3, 7, 377270) Dr. A. Lakshmipathi writes:
('72', 210, 4, 8, 377298) I have seen some institutions conducted by missionaries, where the schools are worked only in the mornings, the evenings being spent either in agricultural operations or in some handicraft work for which the students are paid some wages according to the quality and quantity of work done by them.
('72', 210, 4, 9, 377595) In this way, the institution is made more or less self supporting, and the students do not feel like fish out of water when they leave the school, as they have learnt to do some work enabling them to earn at least their livelihood.
('72', 210, 4, 10, 377827) I have noticed that the atmosphere in which such schools are conducted is quite different from the dull routine of the stereotyped schools of the Education Department.
('72', 210, 4, 11, 377995) The boys look more healthy and happy in the idea that they have turned out some useful work, and are physically of a better build.
('72', 210, 4, 12, 378126) These schools are closed for a short period in the agricultural seasons when all their energy is required for field work.
('72', 210, 4, 13, 378248) Even in cities, such of the boys as have an aptitude may be employed in trades and professions, thereby enabling them to find a diversion.
('72', 210, 4, 14, 378387) One meal may also be provided at school for those boys who are in need, or for all who wish to partake of the same in an interval of half an hour during the morning classes.
('72', 210, 4, 15, 378561) Poor boys may thus be persuaded to run to the school with pleasure and their parents may also encourage them to go to school regularly.
('72', 210, 5, 16, 378697) If this scheme of half day school be adopted, the services of some of these teachers may be utilized for promoting adult education in the villages without any extra payment for such services.
('72', 210, 5, 17, 378889) The building and other apparatus may also be useful in the same way.
('72', 210, 6, 18, 378958) I have seen the Minister for Education, Madras, and presented a letter stating that the deterioration of health of the present generation is mainly due to unsuitable hours of education at schools.
('72', 210, 6, 19, 379155) I am of opinion that all schools and colleges should work only in the morning, i.

('72', 211, 0, 1, 379261) 212 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 211, 1, 2, 379303) study of four hours at school must be quite enough.
('72', 211, 1, 3, 379355) The afternoon should be spent at home, and the evening should be devoted to games and physical development.
('72', 211, 1, 4, 379463) Some of the boys may employ themselves in earning their livelihood, and some may help their parents in their business.
('72', 211, 1, 5, 379582) The students will be more in touch with their parents, which is essential for development of any vocational calling and hereditary aptitude.
('72', 211, 2, 6, 379723) If we realize that body building is nation building, the proposed change, though apparently revolutionary, is according to Indian customs and climate, and it would be welcome to most people.
('72', 211, 2, 7, 379914) Of Dr. Lakshmipathi’s suggestion for restricting school hours to mornings, I do not wish to say much save to commend it to the educational authorities.
('72', 211, 2, 8, 380066) As to the more or less self supporting institutions, they could not do anything else if they were to pay their way partly or wholly and make something of their pupils.
('72', 211, 2, 9, 380234) Yet my suggestion has shocked some educationists because they have known no other method.
('72', 211, 2, 10, 380324) The very idea of education being self supporting seems to them to rob education of all value.
('72', 211, 2, 11, 380418) They see in the suggestion a mercenary motive.
('72', 211, 2, 12, 380465) I have, however, just been reading a monograph on a Jewish effort in matters educational.
('72', 211, 2, 13, 380555) In it the writer speaks thus of the vocational training imparted in the Jewish schools:
('72', 211, 3, 14, 380643) So they find the labour of their hands to be worthy in itself.
('72', 211, 3, 15, 380706) It is made lighter by intellectual activity, it is ennobled by the patriotic ideal which it serves.
('72', 211, 3, 16, 380806) Given the right kind of teachers, our children will be taught the dignity of labour and learn to regard it as an integral part and a means of their intellectual growth, and to realize that it is patriotic to pay for their training through their labour.
('72', 211, 3, 17, 381059) The core of my suggestion is that handicrafts are to be taught, not merely for productive work, but for developing the intellect of the pupils.
('72', 211, 3, 18, 381203) Surely, if the State takes charge of the children between seven and fourteen, and trains their bodies and minds through productive labour, the public schools must be frauds and teachers idiots if they cannot become self supporting.
('72', 211, 3, 19, 381435) Supposing that every boy and girl works, not as a machine but as an intelligent unit, taking interest in the corporate work done under expert guidance, the corporate labour should be, say, after the first year of the course, worth one anna per hour.
('72', 211, 3, 20, 381685) Thus for twenty six working days of four hours per day, each child will have earned Rs. 6 8 0 per month.
('72', 211, 3, 21, 381790) The only question is whether millions of children can be so profitably employed.
('72', 211, 3, 22, 381871) We should be intellectual bankrupts if
('72', 212, 0, 1, 381910) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 213
('72', 212, 1, 2, 381954) we cannot direct the energy of our children so as to get from them, after a year’s training, one anna worth of marketable labour per hour.
('72', 212, 1, 3, 382093) I know that nowhere in India do villagers earn so much as one anna per hour in the villages.
('72', 212, 1, 4, 382186) That is because we have reconciled ourselves to the intense disparity between the haves and the have nots, and because the city people have, perhaps unwittingly, joined in the British exploitation of the village.

('72', 213, 7, 10, 384059) September 12, 1937
('72', 213, 8, 11, 384078) KANTI, Just now I am not able to write to you myself.
('72', 213, 8, 12, 384132) What is this you are doing?
('72', 213, 8, 13, 384160) You are making yourself needlessly unhappy.
('72', 213, 8, 14, 384204) I can’t understand anything.
('72', 213, 8, 15, 384233) Amtul Salaam would never have gone to Trivandrum if you had forbidden her.
('72', 213, 8, 16, 384308) No sooner did you ask me to call her back than I acted.
('72', 213, 8, 17, 384364) But I was not ready to call her back at the risk of displeasing everybody, Ramachandran 2, Saraswati and Papara mma, and interrupting the improvement in her health.
('72', 213, 8, 18, 384529) Had I known— which I now do—how sensitive you are even now, I would have incurred all these risks and called her back.
('72', 213, 8, 19, 384648) But how was I to know that you, who show yourself off as a very brave person, are in fact so weak hearted that you would fall ill to the point of being bed ridden merely by imagining things?
('72', 213, 8, 20, 384839) When I talked to her under some pretext, she immediately agreed that not only would she never write to you but she would not write to Saraswati or anybody else and would never in future even so much as talk of going to Trivandrum.
('72', 213, 8, 21, 385070) What more can she do?
('72', 213, 8, 22, 385092) Why so much hatred?
('72', 213, 8, 23, 385112) I see no blemish in her.
('72', 213, 8, 24, 385137) She doesn’t ask for anybody’s service but goes on silently serving others.
('72', 213, 8, 25, 385212) Why then do you hate her so much?
('72', 213, 8, 26, 385246) Wake up, pull yourself together, leave this profound darkness and come out into the light.
('72', 213, 8, 27, 385337) How can one cure suffering that has no basis at all?
('72', 213, 8, 28, 385390) I have already sent you a wire and am awaiting a reply.

('72', 214, 7, 19, 386377) I must have plenty of mental rest, as also physical.
('72', 214, 7, 20, 386430) The latter I always have, but mental rest is sometimes disturbed.
('72', 214, 7, 21, 386496) I find it a problem to manage people.

('72', 215, 8, 16, 387360) [Before September 13, 1937]
('72', 215, 9, 17, 387388) Motioning to a varnished box about half the size of an orange crate six feet in front of him, Gandhiji said: You’d better sit over there.
('72', 215, 10, 18, 387526) I ask him some questions about Indian politics, about the victorious Congress party’s policies.
('72', 215, 10, 19, 387622) This isn’t the time for such questions.
('72', 215, 10, 20, 387662) I have work to do here, I can’t take myself from it to answer them.
('72', 215, 10, 21, 387730) You should ask these questions of the political leaders.
('72', 215, 10, 22, 387787) Of course, I wouldn’t say that I don’t know anything about politics.
('72', 215, 10, 23, 387856) But I have no time for such questions now.
('72', 215, 10, 24, 387899) Many feel that any form of co operation is a mistake.
('72', 215, 10, 25, 387953) Others disagree, feeling that perhaps our objectives can best be achieved by giving ground now and then.
('72', 215, 10, 26, 388058) Both groups are sincere.
('72', 215, 10, 27, 388083) We have just won a great victory and this brings us a big responsibility.
('72', 215, 10, 28, 388157) We had literally no opposition.
('72', 215, 10, 29, 388189) This is what counts.

('72', 216, 2, 8, 388848) We make no conscious effort to influence American opinion.
('72', 216, 2, 9, 388907) I believe that the American is emotionally sympathetic to our cause, but he is profoundly ignorant of the real facts and of our real problem.
('72', 216, 2, 10, 389049) When the time is right the American will learn the truth by what we do.
('72', 216, 3, 11, 389121) It’s a prevalent idea in America, that India requires England for defence.
('72', 216, 3, 12, 389196) Without the English, would there be civil and religious disturbances?
('72', 216, 3, 13, 389266) As the Congress party is successful in driving the English out of power in India, will India fall a prey to someone else?
('72', 216, 3, 14, 389388) Or, for that matter, how will Congress deal with the native Princes right here at home?
('72', 216, 3, 15, 389476) These are gross superstitions.
('72', 216, 3, 16, 389507) They have been propagated for years.
('72', 216, 3, 17, 389544) Stories and many of such dangers are hopelessly exaggerated.
('72', 216, 3, 18, 389605) I know that many English people sincerely believe them; there you have the power of such ideas oft repeated.
('72', 216, 3, 19, 389714) As to the native States, they’ll fall in line when India comes into her own.
('72', 216, 4, 20, 389791) A subject close to Gandhi’s heart, one of which he will talk freely, is his great movement to improve the lot of the Indian villager or farmer.
('72', 216, 4, 21, 389935) Experiments are constantly being made, designed to develop new ways to Progress the villager’s lot.
('72', 216, 4, 22, 390035) The Mahatma told me: Progress is slow, but you must remember that our work is new.
('72', 216, 4, 23, 390118) We started with nothing but faith.
('72', 216, 4, 24, 390153) Only faith.
('72', 216, 4, 25, 390165) Today knowledge is added.
('72', 216, 5, 26, 390191) He breaks into his well known toothless smile.
('72', 216, 5, 27, 390238) You might add a third ingredient—give us part of the money you make when you sell your story.
('72', 216, 6, 28, 390332) You think if faith plus knowledge are potent, faith plus knowledge plus capital are more so.
('72', 216, 7, 29, 390425) He cackles and rocks in a full laugh.
('72', 216, 7, 30, 390463) Have you ever seen an American movie or heard American jazz?
('72', 216, 7, 31, 390524) These are our two most famous exports.

('72', 217, 1, 4, 390671) Do what you can with it.

('72', 219, 2, 3, 392916) September 15, 1937 I held back these telegrams 1 in the hope of being able to announce the cheerful news that seven prisoners had broken the fast on my acceptance of their meeting of the word ‘relief’.
('72', 219, 2, 4, 393118) I am sorry that I have failed in my attempt.
('72', 219, 2, 5, 393163) I can only hope that those who may be special friends of these prisoners will persuade them to break the fast which alone can give the public time to consolidate its effort to secure the very relief for which they are giving up their precious lives.
('72', 219, 2, 6, 393413) I would also appeal to the authorities, whoever they may be, to relent and discharge the prisoners, if they will not give up their fast, even as I was discharged and left to my own resources when I would not give up my fast in 1933. 2

('72', 219, 7, 11, 393756) Bapu has given me many messages for you today.
('72', 219, 8, 12, 393803) He wants you to move amongst the high class Sikhs and awaken their interest in the Prohibition campaign.
('72', 219, 8, 13, 393908) Those who drink should be weaned of it, and especially the women should be roused to draw up a resolution.
('72', 219, 8, 14, 394015) I would like a declaration from notable Sikhs.
('72', 219, 9, 15, 394062) 2. C. F. A. should eat exactly what the doctor says.
('72', 219, 9, 16, 394115) Probably his condition is one which can actually be harmed by fruit, etc.
('72', 219, 9, 17, 394189) But now, of course, he may [have] 4
('72', 219, 10, 18, 394225) passed that stage.
('72', 219, 10, 19, 394244) It should depend on what the doctor says.
('72', 219, 10, 20, 394286) That C. F. A. eats meat is open knowledge to Bapu.
('72', 219, 11, 21, 394337) 3. Bapu entirely agrees with you that C. F. A. should not think about answering Miss Mayo’s book.
('72', 219, 11, 22, 394435) It is not needed either in India or the West.

('72', 220, 6, 11, 395313) And this, he points out, has the advantage of giving him enforced rest from too much writing.
('72', 220, 7, 12, 395407) 9. Bapu thinks your Hindi letters have much improved, and they are not too big now.

('72', 221, 7, 12, 396698) My experience confirms my belief that in India there is nothing so small, so cheap, so artistic, so useful and so beautiful [as the takli] 2. It is also my claim that except for the English language, all other subjects being taught in India today can be taught through craft within the same amount of time.
('72', 221, 7, 13, 397005) In spite of all the assurances you may be able to give, if the parents start at the very mention of the word ‘craft’, if they [shudder] 3 to hear the word takli and will not send their children if you pay them a stipend of eight annas or four annas instead of a rupee and a half, I should, if I were you, close down the school and follow some other vocation.
('72', 221, 7, 14, 397364) A true teacher would teach on his own terms, not on the terms laid down by parents [who] 4 under stand nothing in the matter of education.

('72', 222, 2, 3, 397695) September 15, 1937
('72', 222, 3, 4, 397714) BHAI NARASINHBHAI, Very little money has been received for the Kamala Memorial Fund.
('72', 222, 3, 5, 397799) The largest amount was collected in the course of Jawaharlal’s tour.
('72', 222, 3, 6, 397868) But that did not come in the name of poor Kamala.
('72', 222, 3, 7, 397918) We might as well say that it came in the name of her husband.
('72', 222, 3, 8, 397980) What has happened to Kamala is something that happens to saintly women who pass into the last sleep without being a burden to others.
('72', 222, 3, 9, 398114) This is how the idea of the Kamala Memorial originated.
('72', 222, 3, 10, 398170) She had taken over the case of the Prayag Congress Hospital.
('72', 222, 3, 11, 398231) She collected funds for the hospital till her death.
('72', 222, 3, 12, 398284) The hospital could be maintained only because of her efforts.
('72', 222, 3, 13, 398346) After her death it was about to be closed down.
('72', 222, 3, 14, 398394) And so, a few persons like me who knew her well decided that the hospital should be kept going.
('72', 222, 3, 15, 398490) The easiest way to do it was to make it the Kamala Memorial.
('72', 222, 3, 16, 398551) Jawaharlal donated half of his small estate for the purpose.
('72', 222, 3, 17, 398612) Now how can this amount of some 2_ lakhs be spent without a violation of morality?
('72', 222, 3, 18, 398695) Moreover, those who have given the money have done it knowing this.
('72', 222, 3, 19, 398763) Hence we should regard it as our duty to use the money only for the hospital at Prayag.
('72', 222, 3, 20, 398851) And, if we cannot see that what the women of Prayag gain is gained by all of us does it not mean that we do not belong to India but only to our own province?
('72', 222, 3, 21, 399009) Let us follow the words of the Gita that whatever is dedicated to God in a spirit of service reaches God.
('72', 222, 3, 22, 399115) And this dedication is for the sake of India, through the Kamala Memorial.
('72', 222, 3, 23, 399190) Hence, remove every other thought from your mind.

('72', 222, 7, 31, 399465) There are plenty like you who wear khadi.
('72', 222, 7, 32, 399507) Real khadi workers are those who make and wear khadi and persuade others to wear it.
('72', 222, 7, 33, 399592) The khadi programme would never work if every one only wore khadi and no one produced it, just as Zoroaster’s

('72', 224, 10, 11, 401354) JAMNALAL, Seeing how many members of the [Village] Industries Associa tion had come here yesterday, I felt ashamed and even distressed.
('72', 224, 10, 12, 401490) For such work I should myself go there.
('72', 224, 10, 13, 401530) That would save expense and other things, too.
('72', 224, 10, 14, 401577) My health wouldn’t suffer in any way by my travelling this far.
('72', 224, 10, 15, 401641) On the other hand, I feel much hurt by not going there and dragging everybody here.
('72', 224, 10, 16, 401725) Please, therefore, send me a car or cart, whichever is available, in time so that I may reach there at 1.45 at the latest.
('72', 224, 10, 17, 401848) Get everybody to meet at your bungalow.
('72', 224, 10, 18, 401888) But if the meeting is not possible in the bungalow, by all means arrange it in Maganwadi.
('72', 224, 10, 19, 401978) Dispose of the simple, straightforward business relating to the Charkha Sangh yourself, and as much as possible even of the complicated work, so that we may be able to discuss only the most important matters.

('72', 225, 1, 2, 402355) 303. DISCUSSION WITH AN EDUCATIONIST 1
('72', 225, 2, 3, 402394) [Before September 18, 1937]
('72', 225, 3, 4, 402422) [GANDHIJI] sounded a warning against the assumption that the idea of self supporting education sprang from the necessity of achieving total prohibition as soon as possible.
('72', 225, 3, 5, 402595) Both are independent necessities.
('72', 225, 3, 6, 402629) You have to start with the conviction that total prohibition has to be achieved, revenue or no revenue, education or no education.
('72', 225, 3, 7, 402760) Similarly, you have to start with the conviction that looking to the needs of the villages of India our rural education ought to be made self supporting if it is to be compulsory.
('72', 225, 4, 8, 402940) [THE EDUCATIONIST:] I have the first conviction deep down in me.
('72', 225, 4, 9, 403005) Prohibition to me is an end in itself, and I regard it as a great education in itself.
('72', 225, 4, 10, 403092) I should, there fore, sacrifice education altogether to make prohibition a success.
('72', 225, 4, 11, 403176) But the other conviction is lacking.
('72', 225, 4, 12, 403213) I cannot yet believe that education can be made self suppor ting.
('72', 225, 4, 13, 403279) There, too, I want you to start with the conviction.
('72', 225, 4, 14, 403332) The ways and means will come as you begin to work it out.
('72', 225, 4, 15, 403390) I regret that I woke up to the necessity of this at this very late age.
('72', 225, 4, 16, 403462) Otherwise I should have made the experiment myself.
('72', 225, 4, 17, 403514) Even now, God willing, I shall do what I can to show that it can be self supporting.
('72', 225, 4, 18, 403599) But my time has been taken up by other things all these years, equally important perhaps, but it is this stay in Segaon that brought the conviction home to me.
('72', 225, 4, 19, 403759) We have up to now concentrated on stuffing children’s minds with all kinds of information, without ever thinking of stimulating and developing them.
('72', 225, 4, 20, 403908) Let us now cry a halt and concentrate on educating the child properly through manual work, not as a side activity, but as the prime means of intellectual training.
('72', 225, 5, 21, 404072) I see that too.
('72', 225, 5, 22, 404088) But why should it also support the school?
('72', 225, 5, 23, 404131) That will be the test of its value.
('72', 225, 5, 24, 404167) The child at the age of 14, that is after finishing a seven years’ course, should be discharged as an earning unit.
('72', 225, 5, 25, 404283) Even now the poor people’s children automatically lend a helping hand to their parents—the feeling at the back of their minds being, what shall my parents eat and what should they give me to eat if I do not also work with them?
('72', 225, 5, 26, 404511) That is an education in itself.
('72', 225, 5, 27, 404543) Even so the State takes charge of the child at seven and returns it to the family as an earning unit.
('72', 225, 5, 28, 404645) You impart education and simultaneously cut at

('72', 226, 1, 2, 404807) the root of unemployment.
('72', 226, 1, 3, 404833) You have to train the boys in one occupation or another.
('72', 226, 1, 4, 404890) Round this special occupation you will train up his mind, his body, his handwriting, his artistic sense, and so on.
('72', 226, 1, 5, 405006) He will be master of the craft he learns.
('72', 226, 2, 6, 405048) But supposing a boy takes up the art and science of making khadi.
('72', 226, 2, 7, 405114) Do you think it must occupy him all the seven years to master the craft?
('72', 226, 2, 8, 405187) It must, if he will not learn it mechanically.
('72', 226, 2, 9, 405234) Why do we give years to the study of history or to the study of languages?
('72', 226, 2, 10, 405309) Is a craft any the less important than these subjects which have been up to now given an artificial importance?
('72', 226, 3, 11, 405421) But as you have been mainly thinking of spinning and weaving, evidently you are thinking of making of these schools so many weaving schools.
('72', 226, 3, 12, 405562) A child may have no aptitude for weaving and may have it for something else.
('72', 226, 3, 13, 405639) Quite so.
('72', 226, 3, 14, 405649) Then we will teach him some other craft.
('72', 226, 3, 15, 405690) But you must know that one school will not teach many crafts.
('72', 226, 3, 16, 405752) The idea is that we should have one teacher for twenty five boys, and you may have as many classes or schools of twenty five boys as you have teachers available, and have each of these schools specializing in a separate craft—carpentry, smithy, tanning or shoe making.
('72', 226, 3, 17, 406021) Only you must bear in mind the fact that you develop the child’s mind through each of these crafts.
('72', 226, 3, 18, 406121) And I would emphasize one more thing.
('72', 226, 3, 19, 406159) You must forget the cities and concentrate on the villages.
('72', 226, 3, 20, 406219) They are an ocean.
('72', 226, 3, 21, 406238) The cities are a mere drop in the ocean.
('72', 226, 3, 22, 406279) That is why you cannot think of subjects like brick making.
('72', 226, 3, 23, 406339) If they must be civil and mechanical engineers, they will after the seven years’ course go to the special colleges meant for these higher and specialized courses.
('72', 226, 3, 24, 406502) And let me emphasize one more fact.
('72', 226, 3, 25, 406538) We are apt to think lightly of the village crafts because we have divorced educational from manual training.
('72', 226, 3, 26, 406647) Manual work has been regarded as something inferior, and owing to the wretched distortion of the varna we came to regard spinners and weavers and carpenters and shoe makers as belonging to the inferior castes and the proletariat.
('72', 226, 3, 27, 406877) We have had no Cromptons 1 and Hargreaves 2 because of this vicious system of considering the crafts as something inferior divorced from the skilled.
('72', 226, 3, 28, 407027) If they had been regarded as callings having an independent status of their own equal
('72', 226, 4, 29, 407113) 1 Samuel Crompton, inventor of the spinning mule, and William Crompton and his son George Crompton, inventors of improved weaving loom 2 James Hargreaves, inventor of the spinning jenny
('72', 227, 0, 1, 407299) 228 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 227, 1, 2, 407341) to the status that learning enjoyed, we should have had great inventors from among our craftsmen.
('72', 227, 1, 3, 407439) Of course the ‘spinning jenny’ led on to the discovery of water power and other things which made the mill displace the labour of thousands of people.
('72', 227, 1, 4, 407590) That was, in my view, a monstrosity.
('72', 227, 1, 5, 407627) We will by concentrating on the villages see that the inventive skill that an intensive learning of the craft will stimulate will subserve the needs of the villager as a whole.

('72', 227, 2, 7, 407823) 304. FOR MONKEYS
('72', 227, 3, 8, 407840) I have before me nearly fifty letters from America asking me to do what I can to prevent the export of Macacus Rhesus monkeys from India to America for purposes of vivisection.
('72', 227, 3, 9, 408017) Some of these letters are from humanitarian and anti vivisection societies.
('72', 227, 3, 10, 408093) They send interes ting literature containing harrowing details and pictures of vivisection and opinions of eminent medical men against the utility of the cruel practice.
('72', 227, 3, 11, 408263) A typical letter enclosed a picture of St. Francis of Assisi for whom birds and beasts were as brothers and sisters.
('72', 227, 3, 12, 408380) The reader will appreciate the following prayer of the saint:
('72', 227, 4, 13, 408442) Lord, make me an instrument of your peace; where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; and where there is sadness, joy.
('72', 227, 5, 14, 408680) O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood, as to understand; to be loved, as to love; for it is in giving that we receive; it is in pardoning that we are pardoned, and it is in dying that we art born to eternal life.
('72', 227, 5, 15, 408953) My sympathies are wholly with my correspondents.
('72', 227, 5, 16, 409002) If I had the power I would not send a single monkey abroad for vivisection or slaughter.
('72', 227, 5, 17, 409091) My advice to my correspondents is that they should promote representations to the Government of India which, if they are well supported are, bound to be listened to by them.
('72', 227, 5, 18, 409265) The other way obviously is a strong public agitation in India against the practice of sending monkeys abroad.
('72', 227, 5, 19, 409375) Of this, so far as I can see, there is not much prospect.
('72', 227, 5, 20, 409433) The public hardly know that there is any export of monkeys.
('72', 227, 5, 21, 409493) And I do not know how to prevent private persons from carrying on what must be to them a lucrative trade.
('72', 227, 5, 22, 409599) All, therefore, that I can do is to express the pious wish that India will be no party to what
('72', 228, 0, 1, 409694) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 229
('72', 228, 1, 2, 409738) is undoubtedly an inhuman practice.
('72', 228, 1, 3, 409774) It would be wrong to subject the lower creation to living death even if it could be proved that it contributed something to the alleviation of human suffering.
('72', 228, 1, 4, 409934) Surely, it can never be an end in itself justifying adoption of inhumanities involved in vivisection.
('72', 228, 1, 5, 410036) Rather, the end is for the human family not to sacrifice tenderness, even though the practice of that virtue should involve continuation of human suffering or even an increase in it.
('72', 228, 1, 6, 410219) I suggest that tenderness for others and other life itself promotes alleviation in that it makes pain bearable.

('72', 228, 3, 10, 410503) Every liquor shop should be turned into a refreshment club.
('72', 228, 3, 11, 410563) The money is there: the excise revenue during the transition period.

('72', 228, 5, 14, 410682) A schoolmaster in a southern high school sends me the following extracts 2 showing some of the disabilities of students:
('72', 228, 6, 15, 410803) M. E. R. 99. No pupil convicted in a court of law for disloyal activities should be admitted into a school without the previous sanction of Government.
('72', 228, 6, 16, 410955) No manager or member of the staff or of the establishment shall be permitted to take part in political agitation directed against the authority of Government or to inculcate opinions tending to excite feelings of political disloyalty or disaffection; and the pupil should not be permitted to attend political meetings or to engage in any form of political agitation.
('72', 228, 7, 17, 411322) 100. In the event of such misconduct being persisted in and encouraged or permitted by the masters or the managing authorities, the Director may, after due warning, withdraw recognition from the offending school or withdraw the grant in aid or withhold the privilege of competing for Government
('72', 228, 8, 18, 411617) 1 In the article, not reproduced here, John Barnabas had discussed how various circumstances—social and financial—drive an average man to drink and suggested that prohibition could be launched in an intelligent manner by providing to the labourer some substitutes such as entertainment and refreshment.

('72', 229, 2, 3, 412061) 101. If the public utterances of a schoolmaster are of such a character as to endanger the orderly development of the boys under his charge by introducing into their immature minds doctrines subversive of their respect for authority and calculated to impair their usefulness as citizens and to hinder their advancement in after life, or if he is found to have personally conducted his pupils to a political meeting or to have deliberately encouraged their attendance at such a meeting, his proceedings may be held to constitute a dereliction of duty and may be visited with disciplinary action.
('72', 229, 3, 4, 412656) 79. No books (other than books for religious instruction) not authorized by Government shall be used in any case.
('72', 229, 3, 5, 412770) Government reserve to themselves the right to forbid or to prescribe the use of any book or books in schools.
('72', 229, 4, 6, 412880) 80. (Insists on all children being vaccinated.
('72', 229, 4, 7, 412927) Though a dead letter in practice, it should surely be cancelled.)
('72', 229, 5, 8, 412993) Other circulars still in force forbid the hoisting of the National Flag on recognized schools and discourage the exhibition of photographs of national leaders in classrooms, and penalize schools where students express national views in answering papers at public examinations.
('72', 229, 5, 9, 413270) Most of these should be removed without a moment’s delay.
('72', 229, 5, 10, 413328) The students’ minds must not be caged nor for that matter those of the teachers.
('72', 229, 5, 11, 413409) The teachers can only point to their pupils what they or the State considers is the best way.
('72', 229, 5, 12, 413503) Having done so they have no right to curb their pupils’ thoughts and feelings.
('72', 229, 5, 13, 413582) This does not mean that they are not to be subject to any discipline.
('72', 229, 5, 14, 413652) No school can be run without it.
('72', 229, 5, 15, 413685) But discipline has nothing to do with artificial restraint upon the students’ all round growth.
('72', 229, 5, 16, 413781) This is impossible where they are subjected to espionage.
('72', 229, 5, 17, 413839) The fact is that hitherto they have been in an atmosphere subtly anti national where it has not been openly that.
('72', 229, 5, 18, 413953) This should now be dispelled.
('72', 229, 5, 19, 413983) The students should know that the cultivation of nationalism is not a crime but a virtue.

('72', 230, 1, 2, 414136) 307. SELF SUPPORTING SCHOOLS
('72', 230, 2, 3, 414165) The main cause of India’s economic decay is that her workers begin life too early.
('72', 230, 2, 4, 414248) The immature mind put to industrial apprenticeship gets dwarfed and fossilized; and there is no grasp of the economic significance of work.
('72', 230, 2, 5, 414388) Anybody can exploit such a worker.
('72', 230, 2, 6, 414423) When I visited the Ceylon plantations what harrowed me most was the existence of child labour.
('72', 230, 2, 7, 414518) Even in a country like Ceylon where the population is inadequate to exploit natural resources, child labour is indefensible; much more so is it in India where the employment of children may mean the unemployment of adults.
('72', 230, 3, 8, 414741) Let us not delude ourselves into believing that self supporting work shop schools manufacturing and marketing goods will impart education.
('72', 230, 3, 9, 414880) In actual practice it will be nothing but legalized child labour.
('72', 230, 3, 10, 414946) I cannot agree with the editor of the Harijan that mathematics can be studied by calculating how much yarn would be needed for a piece, and science and geography by observing the growth and improvement of strains of cotton.
('72', 230, 3, 11, 415170) The training of the eye, ear and hand is absolutely necessary, and manual labour must be made compulsory in all schools; but we must not forget that what is called the training of the hand is really a training of the brain.
('72', 230, 3, 12, 415394) If a school aims at education, it must give up all ideas of producing standardized goods for sale.
('72', 230, 3, 13, 415493) It must give a variety of raw materials and machines for children to experiment with and spoil.
('72', 230, 3, 14, 415589) Waste is inevitable.
('72', 230, 3, 15, 415610) A careful study of Sjt.
('72', 230, 3, 16, 415634) Parikh’s figures in the current issue of the Harijan shows that even when a school has specialized in one occupation and has trained grown up children, waste is considerable.
('72', 230, 3, 17, 415809) A vocational school, like a college of science, is a place for experimenting and wasting resources.
('72', 230, 3, 18, 415909) A country like India with limited resources must start as few as necessary.
('72', 230, 4, 19, 415985) That we can force the pace and make the boy learn in two years what he now learns in seven is a curious illusion.
('72', 230, 4, 20, 416099) A child cannot, and should not, try to learn at eight what he can learn only at 16. The foreign language is not the cause of delay, nor are we giving as much extra time to it as people imagine.
('72', 230, 5, 21, 416293) Let us not demand that schools should produce not only men but also goods.
('72', 230, 6, 22, 416368) To sum up, it is bad economy to adopt a short sighted policy which will make the schools solvent and the nation bankrupt.

('72', 231, 1, 3, 416601) There is a signed covering letter to it but the article is unsigned.
('72', 231, 1, 4, 416670) I therefore refrain from giving the writer’s name.
('72', 231, 1, 5, 416721) After all the reader is concerned with the matter, not its author.
('72', 231, 1, 6, 416788) This article is a striking case of preconceived notions blurring one’s vision.
('72', 231, 1, 7, 416867) The writer has not taken the trouble to understand my plan.
('72', 231, 1, 8, 416927) He condemns himself when he likens the boys in the schools of my imagination to the boys on the semi slave plantations of Ceylon.
('72', 231, 1, 9, 417057) He forgets that the boys on the plantations are not treated as students.
('72', 231, 1, 10, 417130) Their labour is no part of their training.
('72', 231, 1, 11, 417173) In the schools I advocate boys have all that boys learn in high schools less English but plus drill, music, drawing and, of course, a vocation.
('72', 231, 1, 12, 417317) To call these schools factories amounts to an obstinate refusal to appreciate a series of facts.
('72', 231, 1, 13, 417414) It is very like a man refusing to read the description of a human being and calling him a monkey because he has seen no other animal but a monkey, and because the description in some particulars, but only in some, answers that of monkeys.
('72', 231, 1, 14, 417653) The Professor would have been on safe ground if he had cautioned the public against expecting all that I have claimed for the proposal.
('72', 231, 1, 15, 417789) The caution would however be unnecessary because I have uttered it myself.
('72', 231, 1, 16, 417864) I admit that my proposal is novel.
('72', 231, 1, 17, 417899) But novelty is no crime.
('72', 231, 1, 18, 417924) I admit that it has not much experience behind it.
('72', 231, 1, 19, 417975) But what experience my associates and I have encourages me to think that the plan, if worked faithfully, will succeed.
('72', 231, 1, 20, 418094) The nation can lose nothing by trying the experiment even if it fails.
('72', 231, 1, 21, 418165) And the gain will be immense if the experiment succeeds even partially.
('72', 231, 1, 22, 418237) In no other way can primary education be made free, compulsory and effective.
('72', 231, 1, 23, 418315) The present primary education is admittedly a snare and delusion.
('72', 231, 1, 24, 418381) Shri Narahari Parikh’s figures have been written in order to support the plan to the extent they can.
('72', 231, 1, 25, 418483) They are not conclusive.
('72', 231, 1, 26, 418508) They are encouraging.
('72', 231, 1, 27, 418530) They supply good data to an enthusiast.
('72', 231, 1, 28, 418570) Seven years are not an integral part of my plan.
('72', 231, 1, 29, 418619) It may be that more time will be required to reach the intellectual level aimed at by me.
('72', 231, 1, 30, 418709) The nation won’t lose anything whatsoever by a prolongation of the period of instruction.
('72', 231, 1, 31, 418799) The integral parts of the scheme are.
('72', 231, 1, 32, 418837) (1) Taken as a whole a vocation or vocations are the best medium for the all round development of a boy or a girl, and therefore all syllabus should be woven round vocational training.
('72', 231, 1, 33, 419022) (2) Primary education thus conceived as a whole is bound to

('72', 232, 1, 2, 419173) be self supporting even though for the first or even the second year’s course it may not be wholly so.
('72', 232, 1, 3, 419276) Primary education here means as described above.
('72', 232, 1, 4, 419325) The Professor questions the possibility of giving arithmetical and other training through vocations.
('72', 232, 1, 5, 419426) Here he speaks without experience.
('72', 232, 1, 6, 419461) I can speak from experience.
('72', 232, 1, 7, 419490) I had no difficulty in giving at the Tolstoy Farm (Transvaal) all round development to the boys and girls for whose training I was directly responsible.
('72', 232, 1, 8, 419643) 1 The central fact there was vocational training for nearly eight hours.
('72', 232, 1, 9, 419716) They had one or, at the most, two hours of book learning.
('72', 232, 1, 10, 419774) The vocations were digging, cooking, scavenging, sandal making, simple carpentry, and messenger work.
('72', 232, 1, 11, 419876) The ages of the children ranged from six to sixteen.
('72', 232, 1, 12, 419929) That experiment has been since much enriched.

('72', 232, 3, 15, 420019) Things seem to move slowly in Delhi, where the poor are concerned.
('72', 232, 3, 16, 420086) The sweepers’ quarters in Delhi were the worst of any I had seen.
('72', 232, 3, 17, 420152) I do not know that they are much better today.
('72', 232, 3, 18, 420199) Thakkar Bapa now draws attention to the serious grievances of stone breakers.
('72', 232, 4, 19, 420277) The poor men are cheated of the price of their labour, and mean advantage is taken of their ignorance and poverty by the heartless contractors.
('72', 232, 4, 20, 420421) It is high time for the public of Delhi to wake up and remedy the evil.
('72', 232, 4, 21, 420493) If the contractors will not behave themselves, the public should support a general strike by the stone breakers and find for them some suitable occupation whilst the strike lasts.
('72', 232, 4, 22, 420673) No doubt before this last step is taken there would be parleys with the contractors.

('72', 233, 3, 4, 420976) NIMU, Received your second letter.
('72', 233, 3, 5, 421011) What does Punditji teach you when he comes?
('72', 233, 3, 6, 421055) Does he give you reading and writing work?
('72', 233, 3, 7, 421098) How do you find the climate there?
('72', 233, 3, 8, 421133) How much money is left with you now?
('72', 233, 3, 9, 421170) Ask for some whenever you need it.
('72', 233, 3, 10, 421205) Perhaps it will be better if I send you the money direct.
('72', 233, 3, 11, 421263) If you can find any work there, do take it up.
('72', 233, 3, 12, 421310) Be of as much use as you can.
('72', 233, 3, 13, 421340) You must have made friends with everyone there as you are a sociable type.
('72', 233, 3, 14, 421415) I hope Sumitra 1 does not make a nuisance of herself.
('72', 233, 3, 15, 421469) It is a very good sign that the Principal himself teaches you English.
('72', 233, 3, 16, 421540) Tell Vidyavati about your constipation also.
('72', 233, 3, 17, 421585) Kanam is enjoying himself.
('72', 233, 3, 18, 421612) Gosibehn 2 and Perinbehn 3 are at present here.
('72', 233, 3, 19, 421660) He gets on well with them.
('72', 233, 3, 20, 421687) Gosibehn tells him stories.
('72', 233, 3, 21, 421715) And if he is told stories he needs nothing else.
('72', 233, 3, 22, 421764) His real education consists of stories, football and kite flying.
('72', 233, 3, 23, 421830) The regular lessons of course go on.
('72', 233, 3, 24, 421867) But if he does not find these as interesting as stories, I consider it a shortcoming on the part of the teacher.
('72', 233, 3, 25, 421980) But it is true, is it not, that the teacher can only impart what he himself possesses?
('72', 233, 3, 26, 422067) How old are the seniormost girls there?
('72', 233, 3, 27, 422107) Is it that they have admitted you as an exception?
('72', 233, 3, 28, 422158) Are there any women teachers or only men teachers?
('72', 233, 3, 29, 422209) The place is famous for its guavas and berries.
('72', 233, 3, 30, 422257) Try them both by turns as medicine.
('72', 233, 3, 31, 422293) Perhaps they might cure your constipation.
('72', 233, 3, 32, 422336) As far as possible, listen to Saraswatibehn’s advice.

('72', 234, 3, 4, 422721) MAHADEV, Lilavati’s illness seems to be getting somewhat prolonged.
('72', 234, 3, 5, 422789) Low fever persists.
('72', 234, 3, 6, 422809) Having an iron constitution, she continues to move about.
('72', 234, 3, 7, 422867) I have, therefore, put restrictions on her.
('72', 234, 3, 8, 422911) Even in food she is made to observe fairly severe restrictions.
('72', 234, 3, 9, 422975) Let the doctor bring his apparatus to examine her when he comes.
('72', 234, 3, 10, 423040) A patch is visible not only on the tonsils but also on the right side.
('72', 234, 3, 11, 423111) I suppose it will remain even after the tonsils are removed.
('72', 234, 3, 12, 423172) So there must be some treatment for the patch adjacent to the tonsils.
('72', 234, 3, 13, 423243) Please write to Chhotalal about this complaint.
('72', 234, 3, 14, 423291) He should write if he can think of something.
('72', 234, 3, 15, 423337) And also write to him about Amtul Salaam and tell him that she has asthma and cough.
('72', 234, 3, 16, 423422) And she has constipation too.
('72', 234, 3, 17, 423452) He should suggest something for her also, if he can.
('72', 234, 3, 18, 423505) As for treatment, she has been treated by a homoeopath and a vaid’s treatment is still going on.
('72', 234, 3, 19, 423602) But there has been no definite improvement.
('72', 234, 3, 20, 423646) One can only say that she is pulling on.
('72', 234, 3, 21, 423687) Write [to Chhotalal] about me and tell him that as advised I am taking two doses of the powder daily for four days.
('72', 234, 3, 22, 423803) Today is the fourth day.
('72', 234, 3, 23, 423828) From tomorrow I shall take one dose daily for five days.
('72', 234, 3, 24, 423885) Find out if he has any suggestion to make regarding food after that.
('72', 234, 3, 25, 423954) You may also tell him that my diet has decreased after his treatment was started.
('72', 234, 3, 26, 424036) The quantity of milk has decreased to practically a half of what it was.
('72', 234, 3, 27, 424109) I cannot eat bread either.
('72', 234, 3, 28, 424136) Before the treatment was started I used to eat wheat in a fairly good quantity in the form of bread and golpapdi 1. I have lost the ability to digest that.
('72', 234, 3, 29, 424292) I don’t mind this, but Chhotalal should know about it.
('72', 234, 3, 30, 424347) I got the mail sent by you.
('72', 234, 3, 31, 424375) I am surrounded at the moment by four or five persons.
('72', 234, 3, 32, 424430) Get well soon.

('72', 235, 5, 8, 424919) 312. THE USE AND ABUSE OF TODDY 1
('72', 235, 6, 9, 424953) A Parsi correspondent from Ahmedabad has addressed me a long letter of which the following is the gist:
('72', 235, 7, 10, 425057) I am not a liquor dealer myself, nor do I drink, though I have found half an ounce of toddy, taken judiciously in illness, to have wonderfully curative properties.
('72', 235, 7, 11, 425221) But then, it befuddles me and I have to discontinue its use.
('72', 235, 7, 12, 425282) Since 1896 when I became a vegetarian I have not taken meat.
('72', 235, 7, 13, 425343) I am sixty five and therefore can claim to speak with some experience.
('72', 235, 7, 14, 425414) I have not a shadow of doubt that prohibition will add to the health and longevity of the working people as a whole.
('72', 235, 7, 15, 425531) But I am afraid that what will be saved from liquor will be swallowed up by cinemas, theatres and vice, besides encouraging idleness and surreptitious illicit distillation.
('72', 235, 7, 16, 425704) Toddy, on the other hand, has a number of valuable uses which I note below:
('72', 235, 8, 17, 425780) (1) Fresh toddy is a healthy, non intoxicating beverage, though under the heat of the sun it quickly ferments and develops alcoholic properties.
('72', 235, 9, 18, 425925) (2) Taken medicinally it acts as a refrigerant and cures the system of excess of heat.
('72', 235, 10, 19, 426012) (3) Toddy is used as leaven to raise the flour for making bread, biscuits and pastries.
('72', 235, 11, 20, 426100) (4) It cures constipation and promotes bowel action.
('72', 235, 12, 21, 426153) (5) From toddy we get vinegar which is used in pickles and as a
('72', 235, 13, 22, 426217) 1 The Gujarati original of this appeared in Harijanbandhu, 19 9 1937.
('72', 236, 0, 1, 426287) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 237
('72', 236, 1, 2, 426331) condiment.
('72', 236, 2, 3, 426342) Unfortunately it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain pure, unadulterated toddy.
('72', 236, 2, 4, 426431) What is generally sold is a thin, poisonous mixture adulterated with water, saccharine, opium and other narcotics which act as a slow poison on the system.
('72', 236, 2, 5, 426587) The toddy dealer, who is generally impecunious and harassed by the exactions of the Excise Department, is driven to make both ends meet by defrauding the consumer.
('72', 236, 2, 6, 426751) In my opinion, what is really needed is to exempt toddy from the licensing system, and make it possible to provide pure stuff to the consumer in sealed bottles at the rate of two pice per bottle.
('72', 236, 3, 7, 426947) To enforce prohibition in respect of toddy, while leaving tobacco, ganja, opium and other narcotics free, would be tantamount to favouring Hindu licensees of these narcotics at the expense of Parsi vendors of toddy, and is bound to make a bad impression.
('72', 236, 3, 8, 427202) The evil of juvenile smoking is daily becoming worse in our country.
('72', 236, 3, 9, 427271) The result is a devitalized manhood and a fearful increase in the cases of tuberculosis, etc.
('72', 236, 3, 10, 427365) The economic bill that the nation has to pay annually for this vice of tobacco smoking works out at a staggering figure.
('72', 236, 3, 11, 427486) If we take the cases of tobacco smoking in our country to be one in three, and two pice worth of cigarettes as the average daily consump tion of smoke for each smoker, then twelve crore smokers would, in a year, blow away 138 crores of rupees among them in this pleasant vice!
('72', 236, 3, 12, 427763) By enforcing prohibition against tobacco smoking the whole of this amount could be saved and the problem of financing primary education for the nation be automatically solved; the national health would distinctly gain; and the daily desecration of the Atash deva1 at the hands of millions of smokers be stopped.
('72', 236, 3, 13, 428075) At the same time the abolition of licensed toddy shops in the cities would cause the townspeople to go to the villages for fresh drawn toddy and help to put some money into the pockets of the needy village folk.
('72', 236, 3, 14, 428287) Perhaps you know that in certain parts of the Surat District the date palm is the only stay of the poor as the sub soil water is too brackish to support any other cultivation.
('72', 236, 3, 15, 428463) The necessity of journeying to the villages to obtain toddy will also serve as an automatic check on the consumption of toddy and effectively reduce the evil of drunkenness that is becoming more and more rampant in all the big cities.
('72', 236, 3, 16, 428698) Other Parsi correspondents too have written to me in the same strain.
('72', 236, 3, 17, 428768) I must confess that it did surprise me somewhat at first that all such arguments against prohibition should emanate invariably from
('72', 236, 4, 18, 428900) 1 Fire god of the Zoroastrians
('72', 237, 0, 1, 428931) 238 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 237, 1, 2, 428973) Parsi brains.
('72', 237, 1, 3, 428987) But it may be that this is due to the fact that, owing to the special relations which the Parsis have with me, they freely speak out their mind, while others, who think similarly about prohibition, feel constrained and hold back their feelings, Let me assure my Parsi friends that I value this mark of confidence on their part as a rare privilege, which I hope I have tried to deserve.
('72', 237, 2, 4, 429373) Coming now to the arguments advanced by my correspondent,
('72', 237, 3, 5, 429431) it will be seen that such of them as are valid do not apply to the plan of prohibition that I have adumbrated.
('72', 237, 3, 6, 429542) Prohibition will certainly not affect the sale of toddy for bona fide medicinal purposes.
('72', 237, 3, 7, 429632) Only, as in the case of other drugs so in the case of toddy, the intending purchaser will be required to produce a certificate issued not by the patient concerned to himself, but by a duly qualified doctor.
('72', 237, 3, 8, 429839) My correspondent may feel competent to act as his own physician, but an average patient cannot safely be left to prescribe for himself.
('72', 237, 3, 9, 429975) The proposed restriction in respect of medicinal toddy is thus conceived in the patient’s own interest.
('72', 237, 4, 10, 430079) It is hardly necessary for me here to examine all the claims on
('72', 237, 5, 11, 430143) behalf of toddy advanced by my correspondent.
('72', 237, 5, 12, 430189) Suffice it to say that I have already admitted the immense economic value of the toddy palm.
('72', 237, 5, 13, 430282) I have nothing whatever against the use of toddy juice as such.
('72', 237, 5, 14, 430346) My sole objection is to fermented toddy which has alcoholic properties like any other spirituous liquor whether made from sugarcane, grape or apples.
('72', 237, 5, 15, 430496) I have myself freely partaken, and made others partake, of sweet toddy gur1 and its sherbet.
('72', 237, 5, 16, 430589) Nor is there any duty on the tapping of sweet toddy for gur making.
('72', 237, 5, 17, 430657) I am planning to tap 250 palms here at Segaon in the coming season for sweet toddy and, God willing, I hope to get some of the finest gur and sugar from it.
('72', 237, 5, 18, 430814) The deeper I dive into this question of sweet toddy, the more I find that, owing to the disrepute into which it has fallen by its evil association with liquor manufacture, its proper use has never been inculcated upon our people.2 The grapes of the Madeira island in the Atlantic Ocean, which is under Portuguese rule, meet with the same fate.
('72', 237, 5, 19, 431158) There are vines in every courtyard and wine is distilled in every home.
('72', 237, 5, 20, 431230) Hence in this place ‘grape’ means ‘wine’.
('72', 237, 5, 21, 431272) The term has acquired such a noxious connotation that in our language it has become a common expression and we employ the word ‘madira’ 3 to denote liquor.
('72', 237, 5, 22, 431428) Today hassimilarly become accursed.

('72', 238, 1, 2, 431742) small part in condemning it in the last Satyagraha 1. The above mentioned gentleman can rest assured that now I am atoning for it by helping people to a true knowledge of toddy and by keeping the intoxicating principle away from it.
('72', 238, 1, 3, 431975) May I in all sincerity suggest that the Parsi community can render a great service to itself and the Province of Bombay by renouncing the liquor trade and doing its bit for the redemption of the much wronged toddy palm.
('72', 238, 1, 4, 432195) Is it not also a happy augury that the cause of prohibition in the Bombay Presidency has for its helmsman and guide a celebrated Parsi doctor?
('72', 238, 1, 5, 432338) I hope it will now be sufficiently clear to my esteemed correspondent, and others who might be inclined to think like him, that the prohibition move which I am sponsoring is not calculated to injure Parsi interests or for the matter of that any legitimate interests.
('72', 238, 1, 6, 432605) It is directed as much against opium, ganja, charas and every narcotic as it is against liquor drinking and, what is more, as I have already shown, it does not affect the legitimate use of the toddy palm in which the Parsis as a community are especially interested.
('72', 238, 1, 7, 432871) It does certainly aim at a crusade against the perversion of its legitimate use, in the form of manufacture and consumption of a fiery liquor.
('72', 238, 1, 8, 433014) And, in this holy crusade, my venerable Parsi correspondent seems to be at one with me.

('72', 238, 4, 11, 433177) To the teachers who are conducting national schools I would suggest that if they are convinced by my recent writings 2 on primary education, they should try to put my ideas into practice.
('72', 238, 4, 12, 433365) They should maintain a proper record and keep me informed about their experiences.
('72', 238, 4, 13, 433448) Those who are willing to conduct a school on the lines suggested by me, those who are not engaged for the time being or those who are willing to give up their present vocation and run a school, should write to me.
('72', 238, 4, 14, 433662) It is my belief that a craft which immediately suggests itself for making primary schools self sufficient is spinning and allied processes.
('72', 238, 4, 15, 433802) This includes ail the processes from picking cotton to

('72', 239, 0, 1, 433958) 240 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 239, 1, 2, 434000) weaving intricate designs into khadi.
('72', 239, 1, 3, 434038) The wages should be calculated at a minimum of half an anna per hour.
('72', 239, 1, 4, 434108) Of the five working hours in the school day four hours should be devoted to manual work and one hour to instruction in the science of the craft taught in the school and the teaching of other subjects that cannot be taken up as part of the craft taught.
('72', 239, 1, 5, 434361) While teaching the crafts, subjects like history, geography and arithmetic would be partially or wholly covered.
('72', 239, 1, 6, 434474) Language and grammar as part of it, and also correct pronunciation would be naturally included.
('72', 239, 1, 7, 434570) For the teacher will treat the craft as a vehicle of all such knowledge and will teach the children correct speech and in so doing would incidentally impart knowledge of grammar.
('72', 239, 1, 8, 434749) Children must learn the process of counting right from the beginning.
('72', 239, 1, 9, 434819) Hence, the first beginning will have to be made with arithmetic.
('72', 239, 1, 10, 434884) Neatness would of course not be a separate subject.
('72', 239, 1, 11, 434936) Children ought to be neat in everything they do.
('72', 239, 1, 12, 434985) They will begin it by coming to school neat and tidy.
('72', 239, 1, 13, 435039) Hence, for the present I cannot think of any subject which the children cannot be taught side by side withtheir vocational training.
('72', 239, 1, 14, 435172) It is of course my idea that just as the subjects to be taught have not been considered separately but as interconnected and originating from a single source, I also think that there would be a single teacher.
('72', 239, 1, 15, 435382) There should be no separate teachers for different subjects but only one teacher.
('72', 239, 1, 16, 435464) There could be separate teachers for the different forms.
('72', 239, 1, 17, 435522) That is to say, there would be seven teachers if there are seven forms and one teacher would not have more than 25 children.
('72', 239, 1, 18, 435647) If education is compulsory, I would consider it necessary to have separate classes for boys and girls from the very beginning.
('72', 239, 1, 19, 435774) For ultimately they will not have to be trained in the same vocations.
('72', 239, 1, 20, 435845) Hence, I believe that it would be more convenient to have separate classes from the very start.
('72', 239, 1, 21, 435941) It may be possible to make some modifications in this method and in the working hours, number of teachers and distribution of subjects; but the school of my conception can be conducted only by regarding as inviolable the principles which each school must follow.
('72', 239, 1, 22, 436204) Right now, the pursuit of these principles may not have shown any results; but any minister who wishes to start on such a system of education must have faith in these principles.
('72', 239, 1, 23, 436383) And this faith, based as it is on reason, should not be blind but rational.
('72', 239, 1, 24, 436459) The two principles are: (I) The vehicle of education should be some vocation or craft which would be useful in the village.
('72', 239, 1, 25, 436583) (2) Education, on the whole, should be self supporting.
('72', 239, 1, 26, 436639) It may be not completely self supporting for a year or two in the beginning; but income and expenditure

('72', 240, 11, 16, 437394) How appropriate is this expression!
('72', 240, 11, 17, 437430) Because such a body deserves the punishment.
('72', 240, 11, 18, 437475) Don’t be impatient now.
('72', 240, 11, 19, 437499) Do not worry.
('72', 240, 11, 20, 437513) Busy yourself with your work.
('72', 240, 11, 21, 437543) Really speaking you have never lived the life of a student.
('72', 240, 11, 22, 437603) You had your lessons in your childhood but that was not real student life.
('72', 240, 11, 23, 437678) When one willingly devotes oneself to something, one is said to be living for it.
('72', 240, 11, 24, 437760) As for instance life for the sake of service, life for the sake of learning, life for the sake of enjoyment, life for the sake of [amassing] wealth.
('72', 240, 11, 25, 437909) In these cases service, learning, enjoyment and wealth become the only purpose of life.
('72', 240, 11, 26, 437997) And other things are sacrificed for their sake.
('72', 240, 11, 27, 438045) From this point of view, since you have taken up student life you ought to forget about

('72', 241, 1, 7, 438483) I shall find out about Usha and also write to Sarita.
('72', 241, 1, 8, 438537) I am not sending a wire today because it is a Sunday.

('72', 241, 1, 10, 438621) I shall also write to Navanit.
('72', 241, 1, 11, 438652) Like Ramdas who cannot rush to Usha’s side from South Africa, you also cannot run from where you are.

('72', 241, 1, 20, 439158) Even if you yourself were there, what more could you have done in addition to the treatment she is receiving today?
('72', 241, 1, 21, 439274) If I ask her to come to me it does not mean that she will be served better here.
('72', 241, 1, 22, 439355) But certainly there is the thought that better medical consultation can be available here than at Lakhtar.

('72', 244, 6, 12, 444688) Then she should not live with him, nor should she be harassed.
('72', 244, 6, 13, 444751) R. must have taken treatment.
('72', 244, 6, 14, 444781) However, if medicines always worked, why do we have so many advertisements about them?

('72', 245, 3, 5, 445515) These days, it is not Mridu but Anasuyabehn who acts as my postman from Shahibag.
('72', 245, 3, 6, 445597) Hence I am well posted with news of the family.
('72', 245, 3, 7, 445645) I was distressed to hear about your illness.
('72', 245, 3, 8, 445690) I wondered why God has not granted health to one whom He has granted all the comforts.
('72', 245, 3, 9, 445777) Then I remembered this line from Narasinh: “Do not be affected by happi ness or misery.

('72', 245, 8, 18, 446260) You have anticipated me.
('72', 245, 8, 19, 446285) I wanted to write as soon as Sir Nilratan sent me his last reassuring wire.

('72', 245, 8, 21, 446391) I did not want to dictate.
('72', 245, 8, 22, 446418) The left hand works slow.

('72', 245, 8, 24, 446510) I verily believe that the silent prayers from the hearts of your admirers have been heard and you are still with us.
('72', 245, 8, 25, 446627) You are not a mere singer of the world.

('72', 247, 6, 20, 449009) And I have advised that he should send Jivantika to her husband’s place.
('72', 247, 6, 21, 449082) Nothing more need be done in this matter.
('72', 247, 6, 22, 449124) I understand about the anonymous note of threat.
('72', 247, 6, 23, 449173) We should know what Raojibhai says.
('72', 247, 6, 24, 449209) I have talked over everything with Dinkar.
('72', 247, 6, 25, 449252) He himself offered to have a talk with you and report to you the substance of our talk.
('72', 247, 6, 26, 449340) I, therefore, did not write to you anything.
('72', 247, 6, 27, 449385) The long and short of it is that he would give his services as long as the Congress work goes on.
('72', 247, 6, 28, 449483) He will accept whatever we give him to meet his expenses.
('72', 247, 6, 29, 449541) His needs are fairly numerous.
('72', 247, 6, 30, 449572) I, therefore, would advise that he should be paid Rs. 100. Sometimes he may save a little from it and sometimes he will spend the whole amount.

('72', 248, 6, 14, 450443) SUJNA BHAISHRI, I have a faint impression that I wrote to you about prohibition in Bhavnagar.
('72', 248, 6, 15, 450537) But I don’t find a note about it anywhere.
('72', 248, 6, 16, 450580) However, as often happens these days, I might have only thought of writing and then imagined that I had actually written.
('72', 248, 6, 17, 450702) I write very little with my own hand, and that too with the left.
('72', 248, 6, 18, 450768) It is possible, therefore, that if there was nobody with me when I wished to write, the intention was not carried out.
('72', 248, 6, 19, 450887) This is just by way of preface.
('72', 248, 6, 20, 450919) What are the implications of the prohibition which is in force in Bhavnagar?
('72', 248, 6, 21, 450996) For how long has it been in force?
('72', 248, 6, 22, 451031) What is the result?
('72', 248, 6, 23, 451051) Is the loss in revenue through prohibition made good through the improved condition of the people?
('72', 248, 6, 24, 451150) I won’t be perturbed if the result has been contrary to my expectations.
('72', 248, 6, 25, 451223) Nor would I be surprised if the result has been according to my expectations, for any other result is impossible where the constructive work which should accompany prohibition is carried out.
('72', 248, 6, 26, 451415) It will be enough if you entrust this job to any officer of your Excise Department and he writes to me.
('72', 248, 6, 27, 451519) I certainly don’t want this matter to weigh on your mind.

('72', 249, 1, 2, 451727) 328. HAVOC IN ORISSA
('72', 249, 2, 3, 451748) Floods, famines and pestilences have become part of the natural life of India.
('72', 249, 2, 4, 451827) Famines and floods take place almost all the world over, but their effects are largely overcome in countries which have financial and other resources.
('72', 249, 2, 5, 451978) But in India, where poverty reaches the point of starvation, the effects of floods and famines are not only not overcome but are felt with double force, and pestilences are ever with us through the same cause.
('72', 249, 2, 6, 452188) But the gravest defect of India’s pauperism is that we have come to regard these visitations with resignation which is none the less brutal because it is unconscious.
('72', 249, 2, 7, 452355) To illustrate my point I single out the case of Orissa because of the appeal issued by the Minister of Revenue and Public Works in his capacity as Chairman of the Orissa Flood Relief Committee.
('72', 249, 2, 8, 452549) In him, a member of the Congress Ministry, Government and the Congress combine.
('72', 249, 2, 9, 452629) But in a covering letter he tells me that the response to the appeal has been nothing worth mentioning.
('72', 249, 2, 10, 452733) The Orissa Governor, in his address at the inaugural meeting of the Flood Relief Fund, says: “As it was graphically put to me, on the night of the 6th August 30,000 people in this town, Cuttack, were sleeping or trying to sleep ten feet below the river level.” Cuttack is an insignificant place compared to Bombay.
('72', 249, 2, 11, 453048) It is not one tenth the size of that city.
('72', 249, 2, 12, 453091) Imagine what would happen to Bombay if there was a river passing by it, and floods put three lakhs of people in the predicament in which the people of Cuttack found themselves on the night of the sixth of August!
('72', 249, 2, 13, 453304) Fifteen hundred square miles in the districts of Cuttack and Puri have been affected by floods.
('72', 249, 2, 14, 453400) But the recurrence of such floods annually in many parts of India has made popular conscience blunt even in a place so cosmopolitan as Bombay which has never failed to respond to the cry of distress no matter from what corner of India it has come.
('72', 249, 2, 15, 453648) If my pen moves any person to respond to the appeal, let him or her send whatever he or she can.
('72', 249, 2, 16, 453745) There are various charities in Bombay.
('72', 249, 2, 17, 453784) I venture to suggest that they can take consolidated action by making a joint inquiry into all such cases that may come under their notice and can then make proportionate contributions in accordance with the funds at their disposal.
('72', 249, 2, 18, 454017) If this suggestion is adopted, no distress need go unheard because of want of proper championship.
('72', 249, 2, 19, 454116) At present, it will be admitted there is no method in the distribution of these great charities.
('72', 249, 2, 20, 454213) This suggestion is, however, for the future.
('72', 249, 2, 21, 454258) For the time being, following the proverb ‘he gives twice who quickly gives’, let
('72', 250, 0, 1, 454340) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 251
('72', 250, 1, 2, 454384) those who feel impelled give without waiting for any joint action.
('72', 250, 1, 3, 454451) A word, however, to the Ministers.
('72', 250, 1, 4, 454486) Whatever donations they may receive will give only partial relief.
('72', 250, 1, 5, 454553) They ought, therefore, to do two things: first, adopt means and measures to make people, who may be affected, learn the art of helping themselves by engaging in any productive occupation.
('72', 250, 1, 6, 454741) Bihar took up spinning and the like.
('72', 250, 1, 7, 454778) Orissa may take up other occupations if people will not look at the spinning wheel.
('72', 250, 1, 8, 454862) The chief thing is to learn the dignity of labour.
('72', 250, 1, 9, 454913) Let the Ministers put off their kurtas for a little time daily, and work as common labourers, so as to give an impetus to others who may be in need of labour and what labour brings.
('72', 250, 1, 10, 455095) Secondly, they should make a proper effort to harness engineering skill so as to guide into healthy channels the course of the rushing waters during the monsoons Harijan, 25 9 1937

('72', 250, 3, 12, 455299) Sardar Sir Jogendra Singh is a great social reformer, a man of letters and a politician.
('72', 250, 3, 13, 455388) Whatever, therefore, he writes commands attention.
('72', 250, 3, 14, 455439) He has contributed an article on total prohibition to The Times of India.
('72', 250, 3, 15, 455513) Having read it with the care his writings demand from me, I must confess that I left the article with a sigh.
('72', 250, 3, 16, 455623) How could such a reformer accept defeat on grounds that do not bear examination?
('72', 250, 3, 17, 455704) His only argument seems to be: ‘There is bound to be illicit distillation and secret drinking, therefore do not attempt prohibition.’ In the Punjab there was local option but nobody applied it.
('72', 250, 3, 18, 455898) “Therefore,” he says, “my conclusion is that prohibition by compulsion will fail, and provinces will lose revenue which they need for rural reconstruction.” By linking prohibition to revenue the Sardar has precipitately given up his case and contradicted himself.
('72', 250, 3, 19, 456162) For in the fourth paragraph of his article he says: “I expressly declared that considerations of revenue would not weigh with me in carrying out a policy of controlling drink.” Thank God Congress Ministries have cut their way through the revenue snare by debarring themselves from the use of liquor revenue.
('72', 250, 3, 20, 456470) Once the loophole is left, the temptation to make use of this immoral gain will be too irresistible, for nobody denies the difficulty of making the drunkard sober in a moment.
('72', 250, 3, 21, 456646) Old Ministers, with whom I used to plead for prohibition, did not put forth the plea of impracticability.
('72', 250, 3, 22, 456752) But they pleaded inability to forgo the rich revenue received from the traffic.
('72', 250, 3, 23, 456832) They wanted it for education.
('72', 251, 0, 1, 456862) 252 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 251, 1, 2, 456904) education paid for by a questionable source of revenue worth having?
('72', 251, 1, 3, 456973) Has it intrinsic merit?
('72', 251, 1, 4, 456997) Has India got her money’s worth from those who have received the education of the type that the schools and colleges of India provide?
('72', 251, 1, 5, 457132) Thieving will abide till doomsday.
('72', 251, 1, 6, 457167) Must it therefore be licensed?
('72', 251, 1, 7, 457198) Is thieving of the mind less criminal than thieving of matter?
('72', 251, 1, 8, 457261) Illicit distillation to an extent will no doubt go on.
('72', 251, 1, 9, 457316) Its quantity will be the measure of the Government’s effort assisted by a vigilant public in the shape of continuous and sympathetic treatment of the drinker and the opium eater.
('72', 251, 1, 10, 457495) Moral elevation demands a price no less than material or physical elevation.
('72', 251, 1, 11, 457572) But my submission is that this constructive effort is doomed to failure if it is not preceded by total prohibition.
('72', 251, 1, 12, 457688) So long as the State not only permits but provides facilities for the addict to satisfy his craving, the reformer has little chance of success.
('72', 251, 1, 13, 457832) Gipsy Smith was a powerful temperance preacher.
('72', 251, 1, 14, 457880) It was a feature of his huge gatherings that several people took the vow of total abstinence under the spell of his song and precept.
('72', 251, 1, 15, 458014) But I say from my experience of South Africa that the majority of the poor addicts could not resist the temptation to enter the palatial bars that faced them, no matter where they wandered, in the principal thoroughfares of cities or the wayside inns when they strayed away from cities.
('72', 251, 1, 16, 458301) State prohibition is not the end of this great temperance reform but it is the indispensable beginning of it.
('72', 251, 1, 17, 458411) Of local option the less said the better.
('72', 251, 1, 18, 458453) Was, there ever opposition to the closing of these dens of vice?
('72', 251, 1, 19, 458518) Option has a place where a whole population wants to drink.
('72', 251, 1, 20, 458578) God willing, prohibition has come to stay.
('72', 251, 1, 21, 458621) Whatever other contribution may or may not be made by the Congress, it will go down to history in letters of gold that the Congress pledged itself to prohibition in 1920, and redeemed the pledge at the very first opportunity without counting the cost.
('72', 251, 1, 22, 458873) I doubt not that the other provinces will follow.
('72', 251, 1, 23, 458923) I invite Sardar Jogendra Singh not to caution the Congress against the much needed reform, but to throw in his full weight in favour of it in his own province and among the stalwart Sikhs.

('72', 252, 1, 2, 459175) 330. FOUR QUESTIONS
('72', 252, 2, 3, 459195) A correspondent asks the following four questions:
('72', 252, 3, 4, 459246) 1. Hindus who once renounced their faith for some reason or other and joined Islam or Christianity sincerely repent and want to come back.
('72', 252, 3, 5, 459385) Should we re convert them or not?
('72', 252, 3, 6, 459419) You may take the instance of your own son Harilal.1
('72', 252, 4, 7, 459471) 2. Lakhs of the Depressed Class people in South India, as you know, have joined Christianity wholesale.
('72', 252, 4, 8, 459575) Some of them, since the Travancore Durbar Declaration2 and the popularity of the Harijan movement, feel it worthwhile to re adopt their ancestral faith.
('72', 252, 4, 9, 459728) What would you advise about them?
('72', 252, 5, 10, 459762) 3. A Hindu was made to join another faith for certain material considerations.
('72', 252, 5, 11, 459841) After some time he feels disillusioned and comes and knocks at our door.
('72', 252, 5, 12, 459914) Shall we welcome him or not?
('72', 252, 6, 13, 459943) 4. Young Hindu boys and girls are often taken hold of by Christian missionaries and converted.
('72', 252, 6, 14, 460038) At some places Muslims are also making use of their orphanages for this purpose.
('72', 252, 6, 15, 460119) What should we do, when these boys and girls, either alone or with their guardians, approach us for shuddhi?
('72', 252, 6, 16, 460228) These, or such questions, have been asked and answered before now in these columns in some shape or other.
('72', 252, 6, 17, 460335) I do not need to answer each separately.
('72', 252, 6, 18, 460376) In my opinion they are not examples of real heart conversion.
('72', 252, 6, 19, 460438) If a person, through fear, compulsion, starvation or for material gain or consideration, goes over to another faith, it is a misnomer to call it conversion.
('72', 252, 6, 20, 460595) Most cases of mass conversion, of which we have heard so much during the past two years, have been to my mind false coin.
('72', 252, 6, 21, 460717) Real conversion springs from the heart and at the prompting of God, not of a stranger.
('72', 252, 6, 22, 460804) The voice of God can always be distinguished from the voice of man.
('72', 252, 6, 23, 460872) The hypothetical cases coined by my correspondent are, so far as I can see, not cases of conversion.
('72', 252, 6, 24, 460973) I would, therefore, unhesitatingly re admit to the Hindu fold all such repentants without ado, certainly without any shuddhi.
('72', 252, 6, 25, 461099) Shuddhi is not applicable to such cases.
('72', 252, 6, 26, 461140) And, as I believe in the equality of all the great religions of the earth, I regard no man as polluted because he

('72', 253, 1, 3, 461578) If he comes back to the original branch, he deserves to be welcomed and not told that he had committed a sin by reason of his having forsaken the family to which he belonged.
('72', 253, 1, 4, 461753) In so far as he may be deemed to have erred, he has sufficiently purged himself of it when he repents of the error and retraces his step.

('72', 253, 2, 6, 461910) 331. NOTES
('72', 253, 3, 7, 461921) AN APPEAL I know that there are many teachers who more or less believe in the method of primary education I have been advocating.
('72', 253, 3, 8, 462051) I know, too, that some are carrying on experiments in giving such training through some vocation.
('72', 253, 3, 9, 462149) There are again those who are inclined in that direction but circumstances beyond their control have taken them away from the teaching profession.
('72', 253, 3, 10, 462296) Now that Congress Ministries seem to favour the plan I have outlined, it is necessary to have the names of those who would give their services to the experiment.
('72', 253, 3, 11, 462458) Will such friends send me their names, qualifications, salaries they would want, and their conditions if any?
('72', 253, 4, 12, 462568) LEGALIZED PROSTITUTION
('72', 253, 5, 13, 462591) Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddi 1 furnishes one more proof of the very high expectations formed of Congress Ministries.
('72', 253, 5, 14, 462702) People have a right to form such expectations.
('72', 253, 5, 15, 462749) Even opponents of the Congress have admitted that they are standing the test well.
('72', 253, 5, 16, 462832) The Congress Ministries seem to be vying with one another in adopting ameliorative measures so as to make their administrations respond to the real Indian environ ment.
('72', 253, 5, 17, 463001) Dr. Muthulakshmi has issued a public appeal to the Madras Ministry to pass her bill which puts a stop to the immoral custom of dedicating devadasis 2 to a life of shame.
('72', 253, 5, 18, 463171) I have not examined the bill.
('72', 253, 5, 19, 463201) But the idea behind is so sound that it is a wonder that it has not yet found a place in the Statute book of the Southern Presidency.
('72', 253, 5, 20, 463335) I wholly agree with Dr. Muthulakshmi that the reform is as urgent as prohibition.
('72', 253, 5, 21, 463417) She recalls the fact that the present Premier 3 spoke out
('72', 253, 6, 22, 463475) 1 A social worker of Madras 2 Literally, servants of God; women dedicated to temples 3 C. Rajagopalachari

('72', 254, 1, 2, 463625) many years ago in strong terms against the evil practice.
('72', 254, 1, 3, 463683) I know that he is no less eager now that he has some power to deal with it legally.
('72', 254, 1, 4, 463767) And I hope with her that before many months have passed the devadasi system will cease to have legal sanction.
('72', 254, 2, 5, 463878) USES OF “MAHURA” A correspondent writes a long letter about mahura flowers, and desires that all restrictions on the use of mahura flowers, other than that for distillation, should be removed.
('72', 254, 2, 6, 464071) As an out and out prohibi tionist I have no hesitation in endorsing the proposal.
('72', 254, 2, 7, 464153) The whole conception of prohibition is not penal but educative.
('72', 254, 2, 8, 464217) As soon as State recognition of intoxicating drinks and drugs, and licensed shops for the sale thereof, is withdrawn, the way of education becomes clear.
('72', 254, 2, 9, 464371) Penal enactments under the prohibition law will have to be of a character wholly different from those that have hitherto been in vogue.
('72', 254, 2, 10, 464507) People will be trusted, therefore, if my scheme is accepted, to make the right use of mahura, and not prevented from using it altogether from fear of wrong use.
('72', 254, 2, 11, 464668) Therefore, under the prohibition law, there will be no check on the right use of mahura, as there will be none on the right use of toddy.
('72', 254, 2, 12, 464806) The following are some of the uses of mahura flowers, mahura oil and mahura wood, which I copy from the letter:
('72', 254, 3, 13, 464918) 1. Fresh mahura flowers are sweet to eat.
('72', 254, 4, 14, 464960) 2. A variety of tasty1 preparations are made out of dried mahura flowers.
('72', 254, 4, 15, 465034) These preparations serve as sweets to the poor people.
('72', 254, 5, 16, 465089) 3. Decoction of mahura flowers is very effective in removing chronic constipation.
('72', 254, 6, 17, 465172) 4. The oil from the seed called dolia is used as food.
('72', 254, 6, 18, 465227) It is the poor man’s ghee.
('72', 254, 7, 19, 465254) 5. Mahura flowers are regarded as tonic for both men and cattle.
('72', 254, 8, 20, 465319) 6. In times of scarcity and famine, which are very frequent in Kheda, mahura flowers go a long way in saving the poor from complete starvation.
('72', 254, 9, 21, 465463) 7. Dolia oil is specially favoured in the preparation of washing soap.
('72', 254, 10, 22, 465534) 8. Mahura wood is used as fuel and timber.

('72', 255, 3, 8, 465867) She will be happy if only she knows that all is well with you two.
('72', 255, 3, 9, 465934) Come here only when you have Mamaji’s 1 and Kanti’s consent.

('72', 255, 3, 13, 466128) Your observations on the hospitals are true enough.
('72', 255, 3, 14, 466180) No one is bothered about anyone else.
('72', 255, 3, 15, 466218) True ahimsa is to regard those who are not related to us as our kinsmen and to serve them; this alone is [true] compassion.

('72', 255, 5, 20, 466561) 333. PRIMARY EDUCATION IN BOMBAY 2
('72', 255, 6, 21, 466596) In discussing the question of primary education I have hither to deliberately confined myself to the villages, as it is in the villages that the bulk of India’s population resides.
('72', 255, 6, 22, 466777) To tackle successfully the question of the villages is to solve the problem for the cities also.
('72', 255, 6, 23, 466874) But a friend interested in the question of primary education in the city of Bombay puts the following poser:
('72', 255, 7, 24, 466983) The Congress Ministry is just now preoccupied with the question of financing primary education.
('72', 255, 7, 25, 467079) The cry to make primary education self suppor ting is in the air.
('72', 255, 7, 26, 467145) It would, therefore, be worthwhile to examine as to how and to what extent this can be done in the case of a city like Bombay.
('72', 255, 7, 27, 467272) The annual budget of the Bombay Corporation for education is said to be somewhere between 35 and 36 lakhs of rupees.
('72', 255, 7, 28, 467389) But this amount would have to be
('72', 255, 8, 29, 467422) 1 G. Ramachandran 2 The Gujarati original appeared in Harijanbandhu, 26 9 1937.
('72', 256, 0, 1, 467502) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 257
('72', 256, 1, 2, 467546) augmented by several lakhs of rupees before the scheme of introducing compulsory primary education in Bombay can be realized.
('72', 256, 1, 3, 467672) At present over twenty lakhs of rupees are annually spent on teachers’ salaries, while another four lakhs go as rent.
('72', 256, 1, 4, 467790) This gives an average of Rs. 40 to 42 for each student.
('72', 256, 1, 5, 467846) Can a student earn this amount in the course of his vocational training?
('72', 256, 1, 6, 467919) And if not, then, how can primary education be made self supporting?
('72', 256, 1, 7, 467988) I have no doubt in my mind that the city of Bombay and its children would only stand to gain by adopting a vocational basis for primary education.
('72', 256, 1, 8, 468135) 1 Children brought up in cities can learn poems by heart and recite them like parrots.
('72', 256, 1, 9, 468222) They can dance, mimic and make gestures, beat the drum, march in a line, answer questions about History and Geography and will know a little Arithmetic; but they will not be able to go beyond this.
('72', 256, 1, 10, 468420) I forget one thing.
('72', 256, 1, 11, 468440) They will surely be acquainted with a little English too?
('72', 256, 1, 12, 468498) But if they are asked to repair a chair or mend a torn dress they will not be able to do it.
('72', 256, 1, 13, 468591) Such helpless children as our city bred ones I have seen nowhere in my wanderings in South Africa and England.
('72', 256, 1, 14, 468702) At present all that these children can show at the end of their primary education course is not worth much and certainly not calculated to fit them for citizenship.
('72', 256, 1, 15, 468867) I have no hesitation in recommending the adoption of a vocational basis for primary education for cities.
('72', 256, 1, 16, 468973) It would enable the better part, if not the whole, of the 35 lakhs of the present expenditure on primary education in Bombay to be saved.
('72', 256, 1, 17, 469111) Taking, for the sake of convenience, Rs. 40 to be the annual expense of giving primary education to a child in Bombay, it would mean that 87,500 children in all are at present receiving education out of the educational grant of the Bombay Corporation.
('72', 256, 1, 18, 469363) Now, taking the population of Bombay to be ten lakhs, the total number of children of the school going age ought to be at least one lakh and a half.
('72', 256, 1, 19, 469512) This means that no less than 62,000 children of school going age in the city of Bombay are at present going without primary education.
('72', 256, 1, 20, 469647) If we take away 6,000 out of this figure as the number of children who are possibly receiving their education privately in their homes, it would still leave 56,000 children for whom primary education has still got to be provided.
('72', 256, 1, 21, 469877) At the present scale of expenditure this would require a sum of Rs. 22,40,000 which, so far as I can see, is hardly likely to be forthcoming on this side of doomsday.
('72', 256, 2, 22, 470044) 1 The paragraph, except for the last sentence, which is from Harijan, is translated from the Gujarati in Harijanbandhu.
('72', 257, 0, 1, 470164) 258 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 257, 1, 2, 470206) I am a firm believer in the principle of free and compulsory primary education for India.
('72', 257, 1, 3, 470296) I also hold that we shall realize this only by teaching the children a useful vocation and utilizing it as a means for cultivating their mental, physical and spiritual faculties.
('72', 257, 1, 4, 470475) Let no one consider these economic calculations in connection with education as sordid, or out of place.
('72', 257, 1, 5, 470580) There is nothing essentially sordid about economic calculations.
('72', 257, 1, 6, 470645) True economics never militates against the highest ethical standard just as all true ethics to be worth its name must at the same time be also good economics.
('72', 257, 1, 7, 470804) An economics that inculcates mammon worship and enables the strong to amass wealth at the expense of the weak, is a false and dismal science.
('72', 257, 1, 8, 470946) It spells death.
('72', 257, 1, 9, 470963) True economics, on the other hand, stands for social justice, it promotes the good of all equally, including the weakest, and is indispensable for decent life.
('72', 257, 1, 10, 471123) I therefore make bold to suggest that Bombay would be setting a noble example for the whole country to follow if, by teaching its children a useful industry, it can make primary education pay its way.
('72', 257, 1, 11, 471324) Supposing a student works at a vocation for four hours a day, then taking the number of working days in a month to be 25 and the rate of remuneration two pice per hour, he or she would be earning Rs. 3 2 0 per month for the school.
('72', 257, 1, 12, 471556) The vocational exercise will keep the mind of the student fresh and alert while providing at the same time a means for drawing out his or her intellect.
('72', 257, 1, 13, 471709) This does not mean that the child would begin to pay 2 pice per hour from the commencement.
('72', 257, 1, 14, 471801) But he will pay during the whole period of seven years at the rate of 2 pice per hour.
('72', 257, 1, 15, 471888) It is a gross superstition to think that this sort of vocational exercise will make education dull, or cramp the child’s mind.
('72', 257, 1, 16, 472015) Some of my happiest recollections are of the bright and joyful faces of children while they were receiving vocational instruction under competent teachers.
('72', 257, 1, 17, 472171) As against this, I have also known the most fascinating of subjects boring children, when taught in the wrong way by an incompetent instructor.
('72', 257, 1, 18, 472315) But it may be asked where from are we going to get capable instructors of the kind that we require?
('72', 257, 1, 19, 472415) My reply is that necessity is the mother of invention.
('72', 257, 1, 20, 472470) Once we realize the necessity for reorientation of our educational policy, the means for giving effect to it will be found without much difficulty.
('72', 257, 1, 21, 472618) I am sure that, for a fraction of the time and expense incurred on the present educational system and the staff to man it, we could easily train all the manual instructors that we should require for our work.
('72', 257, 1, 22, 472827) It ought to be possible for a committee of educational experts of Bombay, if they
('72', 258, 0, 1, 472909) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 259
('72', 258, 1, 2, 472953) are in earnest, to draw up a scheme of primary education on the lines suggested by me and to put it into operation without loss of time.
('72', 258, 1, 3, 473090) Only they must have a living faith in it as I have.
('72', 258, 1, 4, 473142) Such faith can only grow from within; it cannot be acquired vicariously.
('72', 258, 1, 5, 473215) Nothing great in this world was ever accomplished without a living faith.
('72', 258, 1, 6, 473289) What kinds of vocations are the fittest for being taught to children in urban schools?
('72', 258, 1, 7, 473376) There is no hard and fast rule about it.
('72', 258, 1, 8, 473417) But my reply is clear.
('72', 258, 1, 9, 473440) I want to resuscitate the villages of India.
('72', 258, 1, 10, 473485) Today our villages have become a mere appendage to the cities.
('72', 258, 1, 11, 473548) They exist, as it were, to be exploited by the latter and depend on the latter’s sufference.
('72', 258, 1, 12, 473641) This is unnatural.
('72', 258, 1, 13, 473660) It is only when the cities realize the duty of making an adequate return to the villages for the strength and sustenance which they derive from them, instead of selfishly exploiting them, that a healthy and moral relationship between the two will spring up, and if the city children are to play their part in this great and noble work of social reconstruction, the vocations through which they are to receive their education ought to be directly related to the requirements of the villages.
('72', 258, 1, 14, 474151) So far as I can see, the various processes of cotton manufacture from ginning and cleaning of cotton to the spinning of yarn answer this test as nothing else does.
('72', 258, 1, 15, 474315) Even today cotton is grown in the villages and is ginned and spun and converted into cloth in the cities.
('72', 258, 1, 16, 474421) But the chain of processes which cotton undergoes in the mills from the beginning to the end constitutes a huge tragedy of waste in men, materials and mechanical power.
('72', 258, 1, 17, 474590) My plan to impart primary education through the medium of village handicrafts like spinning and carding, etc., is thus conceived as the spearhead of a silent social revolution fraught with the most far reaching consequence.
('72', 258, 1, 18, 474814) It will provide a healthy and moral basis of relationship between the city and the village and thus go a long way towards eradicating some of the worst evils of the present social insecurity and poisoned relationship between the classes.
('72', 258, 1, 19, 475052) It will check the progressive decay of our villages and lay the foundation of a juster social order in which there is no unnatural division between the ‘haves’ and have nots’ and everybody is assured of a living wage and the right to freedom.
('72', 258, 1, 20, 475295) And all this would be accomplished without the horrors of a bloody class war or a colossal capital expenditure such as would be involved in the mechanization of a vast continent like India.
('72', 258, 1, 21, 475485) Nor would it entail a helpless dependence on foreign imported

('72', 259, 1, 2, 475589) machinery or technical skill.
('72', 259, 1, 3, 475619) Lastly, by obviating the necessity for highly specialized talent, it would place the destiny of the masses, as it were, in their own hands.
('72', 259, 1, 4, 475759) But who will bell the cat?
('72', 259, 1, 5, 475786) Will the city folk listen to me at all?
('72', 259, 1, 6, 475826) Or, will mine remain a mere cry in the wilderness?
('72', 259, 1, 7, 475877) Replies to these and similar questions will depend more on lovers of education like my correspondent living in cities than on me.

('72', 259, 3, 10, 476039) NEED FOR SOCIAL EFFORT A gentleman writes: 1
('72', 259, 4, 11, 476084) It may be said that such a belief 2 is prevalent among almost all Hindus.
('72', 259, 4, 12, 476158) One need not find out the source of it.
('72', 259, 4, 13, 476198) I do not know it.
('72', 259, 4, 14, 476216) In this age when men and women are supposed to have and should have equal rights they should be rated equally.
('72', 259, 4, 15, 476327) Why should there be such jubilation at the birth of a son?
('72', 259, 4, 16, 476386) And why should there be sorrow when a daughter is born?
('72', 259, 4, 17, 476442) Both of them have an equal right to live.
('72', 259, 4, 18, 476484) The world can go on only with the existence of both.
('72', 259, 4, 19, 476537) But a belief which has taken deep roots from ancient times cannot be suddenly wiped out by one or more individuals writing against it.
('72', 259, 4, 20, 476672) Only when knowledge that enables us to distinguish between good and bad spreads in Hindu society and when women are truly respected will the incidents mentioned by this gentleman from Kutch be averted.
('72', 259, 4, 21, 476874) Today both husband and wife agree to a second marriage when the first has produced only daughters.
('72', 259, 4, 22, 476973) It would not be proper to say in this case that sexual desire alone prevails; only a certain kind of sentiment holds sway.
('72', 259, 4, 23, 477096) And the sentiment cannot be suddenly wished away.
('72', 259, 4, 24, 477146) Considerable social effort is needed to bring about the change.

('72', 259, 5, 27, 477288) The correspondent had drawn Gandhiji’s attention to the marriage of a 55 year old khadi worker, who had once been praised in Harijanbandhu, with a 20 year old widow, ostensibly for the sake of a son.

('72', 260, 3, 4, 477651) DEAR ATITKAR, Morally and legally, in the Congress sense, there is nothing wrong in your asking for and receiving Government grants now, but I quite agree with you that it would be better if you did not.
('72', 260, 3, 5, 477855) From the views I have been recently propounding about education you will deduce that I would not multiply Universities if they are to be a burden on the Government.
('72', 260, 3, 6, 478020) But I would grant a charter for the asking if the Government is called upon to create a separate examining University, for such a body is more than self supporting from the examination fees it charges.
('72', 260, 3, 7, 478222) In any event, those who seek a charter for a new University have to calculate upon the University being self supporting.
('72', 260, 3, 8, 478343) Colleges and even schools, if the latter are also taken under University wings, would naturally have to conform to the syllabus and other regulations framed by the University.
('72', 260, 3, 9, 478519) Thus you will be entitled to have a charter for the Lokamanya University if you can see your way to making the University self supporting—in other words, that is, if you think you can find sufficient students to appear for your examinations.
('72', 260, 3, 10, 478761) Under my conception there will be colleges for every conceivable art and craft, and, therefore, I would not mind any number of Universities on these terms.
('72', 260, 4, 11, 478917) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI SJT.

('72', 261, 3, 5, 479155) DEAR DOCTOR GOPICHAND, I have your letter.
('72', 261, 3, 6, 479198) I am sorry for the belated reply, but you know the cause.
('72', 261, 3, 7, 479256) I do not at all know whether I shall be able to tour the Punjab on my way to the North West Frontier.
('72', 261, 3, 8, 479358) I rather think not, for the forward journey should be uninterrupted; there may be some possibility on return.
('72', 261, 3, 9, 479468) So far as Jamnalalji is concerned, let his tour be treated on merits, invite him separately.
('72', 261, 3, 10, 479561) He should be able to negotiate it after the AICC meeting.
('72', 261, 3, 11, 479619) As to the Parliamentary work, regard being had to the facts mentioned by you, my inclination is to advise you to withdraw altogether.
('72', 261, 3, 12, 479753) 1 But whatever you do has to be done in a detatched manner.
('72', 261, 3, 13, 479813) Therefore my advice is that you should put the whole case before Jawaharlal and be solely guided by him.
('72', 261, 3, 14, 479918) Offer unconditional resignation.
('72', 261, 3, 15, 479951) If he does not approve of it, send him the statement you would like to make, and then do as he directs.
('72', 261, 3, 16, 480055) That is the only straight and constitutional course, and no other.
('72', 261, 3, 17, 480122) Do not hark back upon the past mistakes.
('72', 261, 3, 18, 480163) You have sufficiently urged yourself by repentance.
('72', 261, 3, 19, 480215) The next step has to be considered on its own merits.
('72', 261, 4, 20, 480269) Yours sincerely,

('72', 262, 1, 2, 480705) 337. LETTER TO VALLABHBHAI PATEL
('72', 262, 2, 3, 480738) SEGAON September 26, 1937
('72', 262, 3, 4, 480764) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, I do get your letters and read them.
('72', 262, 3, 5, 480819) It is a great surprise to me how you could stand the strain of five days of touring.
('72', 262, 3, 6, 480904) When two devoted workers come together, 1 it becomes hard for both.
('72', 262, 3, 7, 480972) Sometimes two weak persons can easily work together.
('72', 262, 3, 8, 481025) And even a strong man will have some pity for his weak companion, and the two, therefore, can work together.
('72', 262, 3, 9, 481134) But you two were like two tigers neither of whom would yield to the other.
('72', 262, 3, 10, 481209) Your joint tour, therefore, must have been interesting to watch.
('72', 262, 3, 11, 481274) Very well.
('72', 262, 3, 12, 481285) Since you have contributed your share towards the Kamala Memorial, what does it matter?
('72', 262, 3, 13, 481373) The amount collected also was quite satisfactory, considering the times.
('72', 262, 3, 14, 481446) Did the (Ahmedabad) mill owners pay handsomely?
('72', 262, 3, 15, 481494) I understand what you say about the Kathiawar Parishad.
('72', 262, 3, 16, 481550) Forget the Nariman episode 2. You have entrusted your problem to me and I have passed it on to Bahadurji 3. He is a hard worker.
('72', 262, 3, 17, 481679) He spares time regularly every day and reads every paper and makes notes.
('72', 262, 3, 18, 481753) He will take two weeks for just reading all the papers.
('72', 262, 3, 19, 481809) He spares time from the pile of cases with him and reads the papers as if this also was one of his cases.
('72', 262, 3, 20, 481915) Don’t mind the delay, therefore, and let things take their own course.
('72', 262, 3, 21, 481986) Don’t read the attacks in the newspapers at all.
('72', 262, 3, 22, 482035) Read the accom panying letter 4 and return it.
('72', 262, 3, 23, 482082) Where did you deliver such a speech?
('72', 262, 3, 24, 482119) If the Congress session becomes expensive, according to me it will only signify our [moral] bankruptcy.
('72', 262, 3, 25, 482223) I see our doom in the abundance of our resources.
('72', 262, 3, 26, 482273) Such glory will be borrowed glory.
('72', 262, 3, 27, 482308) It will not bring out of the volunteers’ hard labour.
('72', 262, 3, 28, 482362) Please don’t read in this any reflection on you.
('72', 262, 3, 29, 482411) I am only foreseeing our future.
('72', 262, 3, 30, 482444) It is a pathetic picture of our condition.
('72', 262, 3, 31, 482487) I have already written, five or six

('72', 263, 1, 2, 482870) days ago, a letter to Ramdas expressing these views but in a different manner.
('72', 263, 1, 3, 482949) Whatever happens, please don’t interpret this letter to mean that you should take no interest in that work and let it suffer.
('72', 263, 1, 4, 483075) Go on with it according to your lights and as best as you can.
('72', 263, 1, 5, 483138) All this I have dictated because I have sat down to dictate this letter specially to you.
('72', 263, 1, 6, 483228) Mahadev has been sent to Dhulia.
('72', 263, 2, 7, 483261) I started dictating this letter in connection with the Durbar case.
('72', 263, 2, 8, 483329) What I have dictated above was only by way of preface.
('72', 263, 2, 9, 483384) Don’t put up a Congress town.
('72', 263, 2, 10, 483414) Make it a village so that the village arts can be poured into it.
('72', 263, 2, 11, 483480) But art requires talent and heart, never money.
('72', 263, 2, 12, 483528) Don’t, therefore, permit anybody to spend even a pie on decoration.
('72', 263, 2, 13, 483596) 1 think that in the confectionery shops and tea stalls, we can permit the use of only cow’s ghee and cow’s milk.
('72', 263, 2, 14, 483709) In other words, the owners should buy their stores from us or under our supervision, and to help us meet the expenditure on such supervision we should issue licences against payment of a fee.
('72', 263, 2, 15, 483901) But I do believe that we should provide facilities for such shops and stalls.
('72', 263, 2, 16, 483979) Only, they should abide by our rules.
('72', 263, 2, 17, 484017) And now about Durbar.
('72', 263, 2, 18, 484039) We must get his village restored not for his sake but for the sake of our honour.
('72', 263, 2, 19, 484121) In exchange for Dhasa he has acquired Kaira as his capital.
('72', 263, 2, 20, 484181) Nobody knew the Durbar of Dhasa, but everybody knows the Durbar of Kaira.
('72', 263, 2, 21, 484255) Raojibhai’s 2 letter, therefore, has had no effect on me.
('72', 263, 2, 22, 484313) On the contrary, it makes me angry.
('72', 263, 2, 23, 484349) But in my old age now I must not yield to anger.
('72', 263, 2, 24, 484398) And moreover he is far away.
('72', 263, 2, 25, 484427) I, therefore, restrain my anger.
('72', 263, 2, 26, 484460) We are likely to worry, and do worry, about Dhasa more than he is likely to do.
('72', 263, 2, 27, 484540) Besides, he worries because of his friendship with Durbar.
('72', 263, 2, 28, 484599) We should have had to worry about Durbar even if he had not been a friend and was only a national worker.
('72', 263, 2, 29, 484705) If we did not, nobody would have cared for us in the Congress.
('72', 263, 2, 30, 484768) All this, however, is mere prattle.
('72', 263, 2, 31, 484804) From the information that Raojibhai has given, it seems we should start taking steps immediately.
('72', 263, 2, 32, 484902) I had thought that we would start after the new Ministry has had some breathing time.
('72', 263, 2, 33, 484988) I feel now that you as President of the Gujarat Congress Committee or the Secretary of the Committee should write to the Premier 3 suggesting that for the sake of the prestige of the Congress he should take up Durbar’s case and advise the Governor to

('72', 264, 6, 15, 486179) Do you know any?
('72', 264, 6, 16, 486196) I know none including my poor or big self.

('72', 264, 6, 19, 486398) Undivided love is 2 the meaning and secret of marriage.
('72', 264, 6, 20, 486454) All else is prostitution, idolatry.

('72', 266, 6, 8, 488500) MY DEAR GURJALE, I had better not address you by your titular name.
('72', 266, 6, 9, 488568) It does not yet come to me naturally.
('72', 266, 6, 10, 488606) I think that you have made a sweeping statement about tea.
('72', 266, 6, 11, 488665) Are you able to prove the economic ruin of thousands of families?
('72', 266, 6, 12, 488731) I know something of the evils of the tea and coffee habit.
('72', 266, 6, 13, 488790) I have written also against it.
('72', 266, 6, 14, 488822) But I am not able to end orse your condemnation.
('72', 266, 6, 15, 488871) There can be no comparison between alco hol and tea and coffee.
('72', 266, 6, 16, 488935) The latter will damage health when indulged into excess.
('72', 266, 6, 17, 488992) But alcohol cannot be taken in measured quantities, except medicinally.
('72', 266, 6, 18, 489064) And it ruins body, mind and soul.
('72', 266, 6, 19, 489098) I would advise you, therefore, to throw yourself heart and soul into the weaning of the addict from his drinks and drugs, and not to raise other issues, however important they may be on their own merits.
('72', 266, 6, 20, 489302) Do the letter head and the adoption of the sannyasi name show that you are now at peace with yourself, flourishing and in possession of the Truth to your satisfaction?

('72', 267, 3, 6, 489974) I preserve some of the notes for myself, but I can place before the public only what appeals to me.
('72', 267, 3, 7, 490074) Do you agree?
('72', 267, 4, 8, 490088) Koyaji’s article 1 is not likely to sway me, for, I take an altogether different stand in these two matters.
('72', 267, 4, 9, 490197) With regard to prohibition and the creation of alternative sources of revenue to make up for the excise that will be lost, I would recommend that you make a close study of the Bill presented in Madras.

('72', 267, 4, 11, 490481) I shall send your suggestions on to Rajaji.

('72', 268, 3, 4, 491030) MATHURADAS, If we think of the Congress policy in regard to franchise, all men and women aged 21 or 18 years should have a right to vote.
('72', 268, 3, 5, 491168) But I see no harm if for some reason we have to adopt a middle course.

('72', 268, 8, 20, 491997) DEAR SISTER, You had a right to offer criticism in the matter of the Gujarat Vidyapith.
('72', 268, 8, 21, 492085) Moreover, I like criticism.
('72', 268, 8, 22, 492113) I accept the three points you have made.
('72', 268, 8, 23, 492154) But I would not agree with you in believing that the Vidyapith has failed.
('72', 268, 8, 24, 492229) The Gujarat Vidyapith and other national institutions have contributed to the struggle which other universities have not done.
('72', 268, 8, 25, 492356) That was not merely because these universities belonged to the Government but because the students and teachers of these universities had a different mental attitude.

('72', 269, 5, 10, 493069) BHAI LAKSHMIDAS, I have your letter.
('72', 269, 5, 11, 493106) I like your frankness.
('72', 269, 5, 12, 493129) It is good that you wrote to Vallabhbhai.
('72', 269, 5, 13, 493171) You should write to him.
('72', 269, 5, 14, 493196) Were you present during the speech?
('72', 269, 5, 15, 493232) It is very good indeed that you are corresponding with Kishorelalbhai.
('72', 269, 5, 16, 493303) The thing compared cannot be identical in every respect with the thing to which it is compared.
('72', 269, 5, 17, 493399) When the preceptor, etc., are likened to the father it does not mean that they are in every respect similar to the father.
('72', 269, 5, 18, 493522) Kishorelalbhai could only mean that if the Sardar is like a father to the Gujaratis, they should regard him as such wherever they may be.
('72', 269, 5, 19, 493660) It is a different question whether he has, in reality, the requisite qualities to be regarded as such.

('72', 270, 3, 4, 494483) BHAI SHANKARLALBHAI, Your letter contains a question to which you expect an answer from me.
('72', 270, 3, 5, 494575) You ask me how it is possible in practice to be tolerant and continue to bear with faults even when they are quite evident.
('72', 270, 3, 6, 494699) You have yourself said and written that you are able to see countless faults in yourself every day.
('72', 270, 3, 7, 494799) And yet, how very tolerant you are to yourself !
('72', 270, 3, 8, 494848) I see countless faults in me every day and yet there is no limit to my tolerance of myself.
('72', 270, 3, 9, 494940) If I am not tolerant of myself in spite of seeing my faults, I would have to fast every day and think of all sorts of expiations and finally go the way of Chhotelal 1!
('72', 270, 3, 10, 495108) But I do none of these things.
('72', 270, 3, 11, 495139) I believe that my tolerance is not misplaced.
('72', 270, 3, 12, 495185) That is why I learnt to be tolerant of others in spite of seeing their faults.
('72', 270, 3, 13, 495264) But I have not yet attained the ideal state because I must be at least as tolerant of others as I am of myself if not more.
('72', 270, 3, 14, 495388) I have not been able to be so.
('72', 270, 3, 15, 495419) However, I find that I want to proceed in that direction and I know I am doing it.
('72', 270, 3, 16, 495502) But even as I proceed I regard faults as faults indeed.
('72', 270, 3, 17, 495558) With these two things my own strength grows as it should indeed.
('72', 270, 3, 18, 495623) I had my first lesson in this training from my parents.
('72', 270, 3, 19, 495679) They were tolerant of me even when they saw my faults.
('72', 270, 3, 20, 495734) I used to worship my parents.
('72', 270, 3, 21, 495764) But it cannot be said that 1 could not see their faults.
('72', 270, 3, 22, 495821) I was quite tolerant of them because of my devotion to them.
('72', 270, 3, 23, 495882) The same attitude then continued towards my brothers and other relatives.
('72', 270, 3, 24, 495956) My family continued to grow.
('72', 270, 3, 25, 495985) But the attitude remained unchanged.
('72', 270, 3, 26, 496022) So there is always a certain measure of tolerance in me.

('72', 271, 7, 13, 496832) BHAI GOPI NATH, What you write about the law suit is correct.
('72', 271, 7, 14, 496894) Filing a suit even over a small amount involves considerable expense.
('72', 271, 7, 15, 496964) But today there is no provision under which one could be governed only by the rule of the panchayat.
('72', 271, 7, 16, 497065) Under such circumstances the golden rule is that we should neither lend nor borrow.
('72', 271, 7, 17, 497149) If you do lend it must be with the idea that you are not going to get your money back.
('72', 271, 7, 18, 497236) You just have to do it.
('72', 271, 7, 19, 497260) And if you have to do such a thing you should be clear in your mind that it is charity.
('72', 271, 7, 20, 497348) It should be remembered that out of the millions those who are required to go to the court are very few.
('72', 271, 7, 21, 497453) If we can be out of [debt] 2 and mingle with the masses like drops in the ocean, we would not have to bother with law courts.
('72', 271, 7, 22, 497579) Now for the profession of vaidyas.
('72', 271, 7, 23, 497614) In the ancient times vaidyas gave the benefit of their knowledge without charging fees.
('72', 271, 7, 24, 497702) They did not charge even for the medicines.
('72', 271, 7, 25, 497746) And generally the medicines too used to be quite inexpensive.
('72', 271, 7, 26, 497808) The Rajavaidyas and such others used to make their own patent medicines and put up a great show.

('72', 272, 8, 16, 498759) I cannot subscribe to your sweeping opinion that a Mussalman who joins the Congress betrays Muslim interests.
('72', 272, 8, 17, 498869) On the contrary, I hold that Mussalmans who desire complete independence for India cannot do better than join the Congress in its uphill fight for independence.
('72', 272, 8, 18, 499030) It is an organization that is open to all who care to join it.
('72', 272, 8, 19, 499093) Do you not see that Mussalmans, if they join it in their thousands, can shape the whole policy of the Congress?
('72', 272, 8, 20, 499205) There is no proportional representation there.
('72', 272, 8, 21, 499252) It is a wholly democratic organization without any communal barriers.

('72', 273, 1, 3, 500194) On questions relating to Mussalmans, the Congress is solely guided by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad.
('72', 273, 1, 4, 500289) I have no notion of the obligation undertaken by the members of the Muslim League, but I doubt not that the Maulana Saheb has taken every care not to allow the Congress to become a party to a violation of any moral principle by any Muslim.
('72', 273, 1, 5, 500529) Generally speaking, I see nothing wrong in a member of a political party transferring his allegiance from one party to another.
('72', 273, 1, 6, 500657) I do not see what objection you can have to the Congress trying to have within its fold all the Muslims it can have by every honourable means.
('72', 273, 1, 7, 500800) It seems to me that the Congress will forfeit its title to be called an all India organization if it does not endeavour to represent Mussalmans and other sections as well as Hindus.
('72', 273, 1, 8, 500982) That has from the very beginning been the traditional policy and strength of the Congress.
('72', 273, 1, 9, 501073) I, therefore, fail to see where the slightest departure from truth takes place in the Congress accepting those Mussalmans who favour complete independence for India and who appreciate the means adopted by the Congress as for instance, communal unity, Khadi, prohibition, removal of untouchability and other things recited in the Congress election manifesto 1.

('72', 273, 3, 11, 501487) [Before September 30, 1937] It amazes me that you fail to see the great merit of the Congress having given dictatorial powers to a single Mussalman 2 in the important matter of choosing Muslim Ministers.
('72', 273, 3, 12, 501691) Of course, the Maulana can err, but it is irrelevant.
('72', 273, 3, 13, 501745) But what is great and relevant is the fact that a Mussalman divine has been given powers, which the Congress has not given to any single person.

('72', 274, 7, 12, 502635) [After September 1937] 1
('72', 274, 8, 13, 502660) The C. however understand that the object of the amendment is to secure uniformity of policy and practice among Congressmen in the Province and strict confirmation to discipline.
('72', 274, 8, 14, 502839) This object can be easily obtained by the P.C.C. passing a by law whereby any member who commits a breach of the fundamental policy of the Congress or of the observances enjoined by the constitution or any by laws would be deprived of the right of voting.
('72', 274, 8, 15, 503095) The P.C.C. may also pass a by law preventing the formation of any organization by Congressmen except with its consent in writing previously obtained at Congress meetings.
('72', 274, 8, 16, 503266) The Committee recognize the special difficulties of the Congress in the Frontier Province.
('72', 274, 8, 17, 503357) Great latitude that is enjoyed by Congressmen in politically advanced provinces is not to be expected in the Frontier Province.
('72', 274, 8, 18, 503485) Khan A. G. Khan 2 is the acknowledged leader without a rival in the Province.
('72', 274, 8, 19, 503563) He experiences difficulties in working the Con gress in the Province.
('72', 274, 8, 20, 503633) He is a silent worker.
('72', 274, 8, 21, 503656) The C. expect Congress men in the province to help him in the difficult task in front of him.
('72', 274, 8, 22, 503750) The organism of Khudai Khidmatgars is Khan Seheb’s own

('72', 275, 1, 3, 504020) It is in the nature of a non violent army of volunteers.
('72', 275, 1, 4, 504077) Khan Saheb has very appropriately called it Servants of God because his conception of Independent India is an India dedicated to the service of humanity.
('72', 275, 1, 5, 504231) Though K. has generously placed at the disposal of the Congress the services of this great organization, if it is to retain its efficiency, it must remain under Khan Saheb as Supreme Commander and subject to his sole discipline.
('72', 275, 1, 6, 504460) It is also necessary that there should be no other organization of volunteers formed by the F. Province Congress Committee.

('72', 275, 5, 11, 504726) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL, So far as I am concerned Pattabhi is a good choice.
('72', 275, 5, 12, 504798) 1 But I suppose you will have the sense of the members of the Committee.
('72', 275, 5, 13, 504871) I don’t know whether you will find time to attend the Educational Conference that is being held in Wardha 2, for which the invitation has gone to you.
('72', 275, 5, 14, 505022) If you can, I would like you to come, but I do not want you to make time for the Conference if more important work requires your presence elsewhere.
('72', 275, 5, 15, 505171) Undoubtedly it will be a strain for two days, but your presence will be a solace to me if you can come.
('72', 275, 6, 16, 505275) BAPU [PS.] You will find herewith the result of my correspondence with Syed Habib, in the shape of a cheque and letter.
('72', 275, 6, 17, 505395) I simply rebuked him for getting money from here, there or anywhere, without mentioning the conversation I had with you.

('72', 276, 7, 8, 505952) PRABHA, I have your letter.
('72', 276, 7, 9, 505980) You shouldn’t have stopped taking milk.
('72', 276, 7, 10, 506020) To observe mourning 2 one may give up eating delicacies, but one must eat whatever is essential.
('72', 276, 7, 11, 506117) If one who has taken the vow of aswada 3 is observing it properly, he would be eating nothing to please the palate and, therefore, would have no need to give up anything.
('72', 276, 7, 12, 506288) Moreover, if birth and death are the same thing, and indeed they are, why mourn the death of the dear ones?
('72', 276, 7, 13, 506396) Or why rejoice at their birth?
('72', 276, 7, 14, 506427) Please, therefore, start taking milk immediately you get this letter.
('72', 276, 7, 15, 506497) If you wish, you can make use of this letter.
('72', 276, 7, 16, 506543) Moreover, our duty to the departed consists in taking up and carrying on their work, and that all of you are doing to the best of your abilities.
('72', 276, 7, 17, 506689) The burden cannot be borne by you alone, even if you wished.
('72', 276, 7, 18, 506750) And if you give up milk and become weak, your capacity for work will diminish, and one may say that you will to that extent be less able to carry your share of the burden.
('72', 276, 7, 19, 506922) Reason with yourself thus and resume taking milk and fruit.
('72', 276, 7, 20, 506982) Come here when you can stir out.
('72', 276, 7, 21, 507015) And let it not be so late that I may not be here when you come.
('72', 276, 7, 22, 507079) Never mind, however, if your coming is delayed by work.
('72', 276, 7, 23, 507135) We shall meet if and when God wills.
('72', 276, 7, 24, 507172) I am not as weak as you suppose.
('72', 276, 7, 25, 507205) I am able, more or less, to attend to all my usual work.
('72', 276, 7, 26, 507262) I can eat sufficiently well, too.
('72', 276, 7, 27, 507296) I do less physical work.
('72', 276, 7, 28, 507321) We are having two fairly serious patients here these days.
('72', 276, 7, 29, 507380) There are other minor illnesses, too, from time to time.

('72', 277, 6, 20, 508386) The temperature has still not come to normal.
('72', 277, 6, 21, 508432) This means that it will take at least another seven days.
('72', 277, 6, 22, 508490) He has become extremely weak.
('72', 277, 6, 23, 508520) But as a patient he preserves wonderful calm.
('72', 277, 6, 24, 508566) Nobody is put to any trouble, nor is there any fuss.
('72', 277, 6, 25, 508619) He has had inflamed piles for three days and there is much bleeding.
('72', 277, 6, 26, 508688) But he suffers everything calmly and shows no impatience.
('72', 277, 6, 27, 508746) Please inform Shakaribehn 1. I asked him whether he desired her presence.
('72', 277, 6, 28, 508820) He doesn’t want her to be sent for.
('72', 277, 6, 29, 508856) She is not needed for nursing either.
('72', 277, 6, 30, 508894) He is being nursed by Bhansalibhai and Sharda.
('72', 277, 6, 31, 508941) Is it true that Shakaribehn will have to leave the Ashram after a month or two for want of accommodation?

('72', 278, 3, 5, 509325) You got more money, too, than expected and got yarn as well.
('72', 278, 4, 6, 509386) I suppose the cotton for the slivers consumed in the spinning done in the school must have been supplied by the school itself.
('72', 278, 4, 7, 509513) If we calculate the value of the yarn after deducting the cost of the cotton, what would be your estimate of the net gain?
('72', 278, 4, 8, 509636) If you can supply the figures relating to the number of days and hours of work of each of the notable personalities mentioned by you, please let me have them.
('72', 278, 4, 9, 509795) What was the approximate attendance at Rameshwaridevi’s meeting?
('72', 278, 4, 10, 509860) What impression did you form of her?
('72', 278, 4, 11, 509897) Did you come into fairly close contact with her?
('72', 278, 4, 12, 509946) Of the sum of Rs. 15,000, did you get anything from outside or did you collect the entire sum in Kathiawar?
('72', 278, 4, 13, 510054) You may certainly reserve Rs. 10,000 for ‘Harijan’ and spend the rest in khadi work.
('72', 278, 4, 14, 510139) How old is Vithal who was among those who joined in spinning?
('72', 278, 4, 15, 510201) Who was the youngest amongst them?

('72', 279, 1, 2, 510801) 360. A LETTER 1
('72', 279, 2, 3, 510817) [Before October 2, 1937] I shall try to make something out of the many handicrafts you have suggested.
('72', 279, 2, 4, 510920) You are so resourceful that you can even shoulder the new undertaking.
('72', 279, 2, 5, 510991) But a few things are essential before you can do so.
('72', 279, 2, 6, 511044) You will have to forget your tomes, and start making use of your hands and feet.
('72', 279, 2, 7, 511125) For this you must set apart part of your busy hours.
('72', 279, 2, 8, 511178) Take up cotton and takli spinning and approach them intellectually.
('72', 279, 2, 9, 511246) I send you Gregg’s 2 and the late Maganlal Gandhi’s book 3 on the subject.
('72', 279, 2, 10, 511321) Gulzarilal Nanda would gladly initiate you into it.
('72', 279, 2, 11, 511373) But more important than this is for you to launch out into one of the villages in the neighbourhood of the city, study how some of the poor handicraftsmen, basket makers, rope makers, etc., make their living.
('72', 279, 2, 12, 511582) Even their crude handiwork will reveal some art; But with your intelligent perception you will be able to find out that there is much scope for improvement in the method of their work, and you will see how these ignorant folks have gone along the beaten track for years without anyone to show them improved ways.
('72', 279, 2, 13, 511895) You will also realize that their ignorance is the result of our middle class ancestors and of you and I having neglected these poor folks, and you will perhaps shed a genuine tear.
('72', 279, 2, 14, 512076) You will then see what I mean by education through handicrafts.
('72', 279, 2, 15, 512140) It is likely that the whole thing may have a different reaction on you, and you may want to preserve the status quo.
('72', 279, 2, 16, 512257) Or perhaps you would reject both the existing and the proposed scheme of things and discover a third thing altogether.
('72', 279, 2, 17, 512376) That, you may be sure, will not pain me.
('72', 279, 2, 18, 512417) For my sole purpose is to seek truth by thought, word and deed.
('72', 279, 2, 19, 512481) That is the thing I am mad about, the thing for which I am living and for which I am hoping to die.
('72', 279, 2, 20, 512581) That is why I challenge friends like you and invite them to challenge me.
('72', 279, 2, 21, 512655) If they convince me of the error of my ways, I shall not hesitate to confess my folly.

('72', 279, 3, 25, 512974) He approaches the question from the purely economic point of view which would seem to make the educational point of view secondary and not primary as Gandhiji wants it to be.” 2 Richard B. Gregg’s Economics of Khaddar 3 Charkha Shastra

('72', 280, 2, 3, 513274) A Harijan sevak reminds me that nowadays Harijans, for whom this weekly was started, have receded into the background and its columns are devoted to all sorts of subjects.
('72', 280, 2, 4, 513446) He is half right.
('72', 280, 2, 5, 513464) I have begun to discuss questions which have been hitherto deliberately excluded.
('72', 280, 2, 6, 513546) The reason for exclusion no longer exists.
('72', 280, 2, 7, 513589) The contrary is the case now.
('72', 280, 2, 8, 513619) In the greater part of India the Congress is both in office and power.
('72', 280, 2, 9, 513690) It is true that the power is limited.
('72', 280, 2, 10, 513728) But it is limited in terms of Complete Independence, not otherwise.
('72', 280, 2, 11, 513796) India is one vast prison with high walls of suppression choking her mind and body.
('72', 280, 2, 12, 513879) But its Superintendent has seen fit to give a large part of the prisoners the power to appoint from among themselves the governing officials with full powers of administration, at any rate enough for growing strong, so long as they recognize that they are still prisoners.
('72', 280, 2, 13, 514152) Well, they have chosen to take advantage of this freedom in the hope that by never requiring the assistance of his admitted physical superiority they will convince the Superintendent that he is no longer wanted.
('72', 280, 2, 14, 514364) Anyway, that being my interpretation of the Government of India Act and the office acceptance, I must strive to show to the co workers, who have become Ministers, how in my opinion they can achieve the end.
('72', 280, 2, 15, 514571) And if I succeed in so doing, the battle against untouchability is almost won.
('72', 280, 2, 16, 514650) But I need hardly say that removal of untouchability from the Hindu heart is, like communal unity, an indispensable condition of success through the non violent action that is implicit in office acceptance.
('72', 280, 2, 17, 514857) Therefore Harijan sevaks have to redouble their efforts to touch the caste Hindu heart as well as the Harijan heart.
('72', 280, 2, 18, 514974) We must constantly remind Hindu orthodoxy of the solemn oath taken at the all India meeting held in Bombay on the 25th September, 1932, under the presidentship of Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya.
('72', 280, 2, 19, 515166) 1 Here is the oath:
('72', 280, 3, 20, 515186) This Conference resolves that henceforth, amongst Hindus, no one shall be regarded as untouchable by reason of his birth, and that those who have been so regarded hitherto shall have the same right as other Hindus in regard to the use of public wells, public schools, public roads and all other public institutions.
('72', 280, 3, 21, 515502) This right shall have statutory recognition at the first opportunity, and shall be one of the earliest acts of the Swaraj Parliament, if it shall not have received such recognition before that time.

('72', 281, 1, 2, 515812) It is further agreed that it shall be the duty of all Hindu leaders to secure, by every legitimate and peaceful means, an early removal of all social disabilities now imposed by custom upon the so called untouchable classes, including the bar in respect of admission to temples.

('72', 281, 3, 5, 516136) A college student of Bangalore writes:
('72', 281, 4, 6, 516175) I have read your article 1 in Harijan and I request you to let me know your opinion on students taking part in strikes like Andamans Day, Abattoir Day 2, etc.
('72', 281, 4, 7, 516334) Whilst I have pleaded for the removal of restrictions on the speech and movements of students, I am not able to support political strikes or demonstrations.
('72', 281, 4, 8, 516491) Students should have the greatest freedom of expression and of opinion.
('72', 281, 4, 9, 516563) They may openly sympathize with any political party they like.
('72', 281, 4, 10, 516626) But in my opinion they may not have freedom of action whilst they are studying.
('72', 281, 4, 11, 516706) A student cannot be an active politician and pursue his studies at the same time.
('72', 281, 4, 12, 516788) It is difficult to draw hard and fast lines at the time of big national upheavals.
('72', 281, 4, 13, 516871) Then they do not strike or, if the word ‘strike’ can be used in such circumstances, it is a wholesale strike; it is a suspension of studies.
('72', 281, 4, 14, 517012) Thus what may appear to be an exception is not one in reality As a matter of fact the question such as the correspondent has raised should not arise in the Congress Provinces.
('72', 281, 4, 15, 517188) For there can be no curb which the best mind of the students will not willingly accept.
('72', 281, 4, 16, 517276) The majority of them are, must be, Congress minded.
('72', 281, 4, 17, 517328) They may not do anything that would embarrass the Ministries.
('72', 281, 4, 18, 517390) If they struck, they would do so because the Ministers wanted them to.
('72', 281, 4, 19, 517461) But I cannot conceive of Congress Ministers wanting them to strike except when the Congress is no longer in office, and when the Congress declares, maybe, a non violent active war against the Government of the day.
('72', 281, 4, 20, 517676) And even then, I should think that to invite students in the first instance to suspend their studies for strikes would be tantamount to a declaration of bankruptcy.
('72', 281, 4, 21, 517841) If the people in general are with the Congress for any demonstration in the nature of strikes, students will

('72', 282, 1, 2, 518078) be left alone except as a last resort.
('72', 282, 1, 3, 518117) During the last war the students were not the first to be called out but they were the last, so far as I recollect, and then only college students.
('72', 282, 1, 4, 518265) I would like the correspondent to read or re read my note on a schoolmaster’s letter in the Harijan of 18th September.
('72', 282, 1, 5, 518384) He will find therein my position regarding the political liberty of students and schoolmasters.
('72', 282, 1, 6, 518480) But another correspondent writes in connection with it:
('72', 282, 2, 7, 518536) If we allow paid State officials, teachers and others to participate in politics, it would become a hell.
('72', 282, 2, 8, 518642) No Government could be carried on if their policies are subjected to debates among Government or other State officials who have to carry them out.
('72', 282, 2, 9, 518789) Your desire that national hopes, desires and ideas of patriotism should have free play is of course proper.
('72', 282, 2, 10, 518897) But I fear your article is likely to be misunderstood unless you make your position quite clear.
('72', 282, 2, 11, 518994) I had thought that my position was quite clear.
('72', 282, 2, 12, 519042) Where there is a national Government there is rarely any friction between it and its officials or the students.
('72', 282, 2, 13, 519154) My note guards itself against all indiscipline.
('72', 282, 2, 14, 519202) What the schoolmaster resents, and rightly, is espionage and suppression of free thought which has been the rule of the day hitherto.
('72', 282, 2, 15, 519336) Congress Ministers themselves are of the people and from the people.
('72', 282, 2, 16, 519405) They have no secrets.
('72', 282, 2, 17, 519427) They are expected to be in personal touch with every public activity including the student mind.
('72', 282, 2, 18, 519524) They have at their disposal the whole of the Congress machinery which, as the interpreter of the popular will, is surely more than the law, the police and the military.
('72', 282, 2, 19, 519693) Those who have not that machinery to back them are spent bullets.
('72', 282, 2, 20, 519759) For those Ministers who have the Congress at their back, the law, the police and the military may be said to be a useless appendage.
('72', 282, 2, 21, 519892) And the Congress is nothing if it is not an embodiment of discipline.
('72', 282, 2, 22, 519962) Therefore with the Congress in power there should be voluntary; not forced, discipline everywhere.

('72', 283, 1, 2, 520121) 363. DOING, NOT IDLE THINKING
('72', 283, 2, 3, 520151) Dr. G. S. Arundale sends me an advance copy of an article he has written for the Orient Illustrated Weekly with the following covering letter:
('72', 283, 3, 4, 520294) You have expressed a wish that education should now begin to be real in this country and not artificial as it has been for so many years.
('72', 283, 3, 5, 520432) As one who has been active in education in India for more than thirty years, I send you an article which is appearing in the Orient Illustrated Weekly.
('72', 283, 3, 6, 520584) Maybe it represents in some degree your own views.
('72', 283, 3, 7, 520635) I do feel that there should be a national scheme of education which every National Minister will do his best to express in his particular Province.
('72', 283, 3, 8, 520783) There has been a good deal of independent tinkering.
('72', 283, 3, 9, 520836) I feel it is urgent that the note of the great principles should be sounded without delay so that there may be a common bond and a common effort in which public and Government alike shall join.
('72', 283, 3, 10, 521030) I take from the article the most important and relevant extracts.
('72', 283, 3, 11, 521096) After dealing with the question of how to proceed, he says:
('72', 283, 4, 12, 521156) I have no space here to suggest the nature of the principles which should underlie national education.
('72', 283, 4, 13, 521259) But at least so far as both boys and girls are concerned in the school sphere—I hope we shall gradually eliminate the absurd distinctions of ‘school’ and ‘college’—the note throughout must be that of Doing.
('72', 283, 5, 14, 521466) However much thought may be stimulated, it is valueless save as it mellows into Doing.
('72', 283, 5, 15, 521553) The same may be said as regards the emotions and feelings, so dangerously neglected in most modern systems of education.
('72', 283, 5, 16, 521674) India needs her youth to be workers—workers whose character is such—developed through education—that it naturally becomes translated into work, into practical capacity, into service.
('72', 283, 5, 17, 521857) India needs young citizens who can do well in whatever department of life to which they may be called by environment and by heredity.
('72', 283, 5, 18, 521991) Every subject of the curriculum is to the end of right living.
('72', 283, 5, 19, 522054) Every subject discloses the Law, the Order and the Purpose of Life.
('72', 283, 5, 20, 522122) Teachers must never forget this as they tend to grow submerged in the hardness of so called facts.
('72', 283, 5, 21, 522221) They should remember that in the world of our intelligence there are no facts, but only conventions.
('72', 283, 5, 22, 522322) It was well said by Sir Arthur Eddington1 that science has taken the great step forward of moving from certainty to doubt.
('72', 283, 5, 23, 522445) Our education must, therefore, cause all its ‘facts’ to rest lightly in the minds
('72', 283, 6, 24, 522527) 1 Sir Arthar Stanley Eddington, a British astronomer
('72', 284, 0, 1, 522580) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 285
('72', 284, 1, 2, 522624) of its pupils, and use them beyond all else for the development of that character which is the only safe foundation both for individuals and for nations.
('72', 284, 2, 3, 522778) And once character stirs, the desire to do will intensify, in the directions both of self support and of self sacrifice.
('72', 284, 2, 4, 522899) There will arise the desire to draw as close as possible to the Earth our Mother, to worship her in the ritual of agriculture, and to become as little as may be of a burden to her by simplicity of need and purity of desire.
('72', 284, 2, 5, 523123) Indeed, I hold that no child of Mother Earth should be unable to draw from her some direct sustenance, and I would have as part of all education some measure of direct contact with her, even in town educational institutions.
('72', 284, 3, 6, 523348) We must tear ourselves radically away from those educational conventions which have made education so largely futile today.
('72', 284, 3, 7, 523472) We must begin, under the existing favourable auspices of the national ministries, a system of real education which is not instruction.
('72', 284, 3, 8, 523607) We have become imprisoned in the ruts and grooves of out of date educational forms and fetishes, and I heartily welcome Gandhiji’s adumbration of an education which is self supporting.
('72', 284, 3, 9, 523792) I am not quite sure if we shall be able to go quite as far as he suggests.
('72', 284, 3, 10, 523867) I entirely agree that a young citizen after finishing a seven years’ course “should be discharged as an earning unit”.
('72', 284, 3, 11, 523986) I myself feel that everyone should, partly through education, become conscious of his creative capacity, for he is a god in the becoming and therefore possesses the supreme attribute of God—the power to create, to do.
('72', 284, 3, 12, 524204) If this power be not awakened, of what use education?
('72', 284, 3, 13, 524258) Then indeed is it instruction and not education.
('72', 284, 4, 14, 524307) There is as much brain in the hand as there is in the head.
('72', 284, 4, 15, 524367) For long the intellect in the head has been our God.
('72', 284, 4, 16, 524420) Intellect has been our tyrant, our dictator.
('72', 284, 4, 17, 524465) Under the new dispensation it must be one among our many servants, and we must learn to exalt all that makes for simple living, that draws us near to the beautiful simplicities of nature, all that helps me to live with my hands—manual work of all kinds, of the artist, of the artisan, of the agriculturist.
('72', 284, 5, 18, 524772) I know I should have lived a happier and more effective life had I so been educated.
('72', 284, 5, 19, 524857) What I have been saying as a layman, for the lay reader, Dr. Arundale has said as an educationist, for the educationist, and those who have in their charge the moulding of the youth of the country.
('72', 284, 5, 20, 525055) I am not surprised at the caution with which he approaches the idea of self supporting education.
('72', 284, 5, 21, 525153) For me it is the crux.
('72', 284, 5, 22, 525176) My one regret is that what I have seen through the glass darkly for the past 40 years I have
('72', 285, 0, 1, 525269) 286 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 285, 1, 2, 525311) begun to see no quite clearly under the stress of circumstances.
('72', 285, 1, 3, 525376) Having spoken strongly in 1920 against the present system of education, and having now got the opportunity of influencing, however little it may be, Ministers in seven Provinces, who have been fellow workers and fellow sufferers in the glorious struggle for freedom of the country, I have felt an irresistible call to make good the charge that the present mode of education is radically wrong from bottom to top.
('72', 285, 1, 4, 525789) And what I have been struggling to express in these columns very inadequately has come upon me like a flash, and the truth of it is daily growing upon me.
('72', 285, 1, 5, 525944) I do, therefore, venture to ask the educationists of the country, who have no axes to grind, and who have an open mind, to study the two propositions that I have laid down, without allowing their preconceived and settled notions about the existing mode of education to interfere with the free flow of their reason.
('72', 285, 1, 6, 526259) I would urge them not to allow my utter ignorance of education, in its technical and orthodox sense, to prejudice them against what I have been saying and writing.
('72', 285, 1, 7, 526423) Wisdom, it is said, often comes from the mouths of babes and sucklings.
('72', 285, 1, 8, 526495) It may be a poetic exaggeration, but there is no doubt that sometimes it does come through babes.
('72', 285, 1, 9, 526593) Experts polish it and give it a scientific shape.
('72', 285, 1, 10, 526643) I therefore ask for an examination of my propositions purely on merits.
('72', 285, 1, 11, 526715) Let me restate them here, not as I have previously laid them down in these columns, but in the language that occurs to me as I am dictating these lines: 1. Primary education, extending over a period of 7 years or longer, and covering all the subjects up to the matriculation standard, except English, plus a vocation used as the vehicle for drawing out the minds of boys and girls in all departments of knowledge, should take the place of what passes today under the name of Primary, Middle and High School Education.
('72', 285, 1, 12, 527233) 2. Such education, taken as a whole, can, and must be, self supporting; in fact self support is the acid test of its reality.

('72', 286, 2, 3, 527467) The Marwari High School, recently renamed Navabharat Vidya laya, is celebrating its Silver Jubilee.
('72', 286, 2, 4, 527567) The management conceived the idea of calling on the occasion a small conference of nationally minded educationists to discuss the plan of education I have been endeavouring to propound in these columns.
('72', 286, 2, 5, 527770) The Secretary, Shri Shrimannarayan Agrawal, consulted me as to the desirability of converting such a conference, and asked me to preside if I approved of the idea.
('72', 286, 2, 6, 527934) I liked both the suggestions.
('72', 286, 2, 7, 527964) So the conference will be held at Wardha on October 22nd and 23rd.
('72', 286, 2, 8, 528031) Only those will attend who are invited thereto.
('72', 286, 2, 9, 528079) If there are any educationists who would like to attend and who have not received invitations, they may apply to the Secretary, giving their names and addresses, and such particulars as would enable the management to decide whether they can afford to issue the invitation.
('72', 286, 2, 10, 528352) Provision is being made only for a limited number who are deeply interested in the problem and can make a useful contribution to the discussion.
('72', 286, 2, 11, 528497) The conference is not intended to be at all spectacular.
('72', 286, 2, 12, 528554) There will be no visitors.
('72', 286, 2, 13, 528581) It will be a purely business meeting.
('72', 286, 2, 14, 528619) A limited number of Press tickets will be issued.
('72', 286, 2, 15, 528669) I advise Pressmen to elect one or two representatives and share the reporting.
('72', 286, 2, 16, 528748) I approach the task in confidence but in all humility, with an open mind, and with the will to learn and to revise and correct my views, whenever necessary.
('72', 286, 2, 17, 528905) The propositions I shall submit to the conference for consideration will be, so far as they occur to me at present, as follows: 1. The present system of education does not meet the requirements of the country in any shape or form.
('72', 286, 2, 18, 529136) English, having been made the medium of instruction in all the higher branches of learning, has created a permanent bar between the highly educated few and the uneducated many.
('72', 286, 2, 19, 529313) It has prevented knowledge from percolating to the masses.
('72', 286, 2, 20, 529372) This excessive importance given to English has cast upon the educated class a burden which has maimed them mentally for life and made them strangers in their own land.
('72', 286, 2, 21, 529540) Absence of vocational training has made the educated class almost unfit for productive work and harmed them physically.
('72', 286, 2, 22, 529660) Money spent on primary education is a waste of expenditure inasmuch as what little is
('72', 287, 0, 1, 529746) 288 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 287, 1, 2, 529788) taught is soon forgotten and has little or no value in terms of the villages or cities.
('72', 287, 1, 3, 529876) Such advantage as is gained by the existing system of education is not gained by the chief taxpayer, his children getting the least.
('72', 287, 1, 4, 530009) 2. The course of primary education should be extended at least to seven years and should include the general knowledge gained up to the matriculation standard less English and plus a substantial vocation.
('72', 287, 1, 5, 530214) 3. For the all round development of boys and girls all training should so far as possible be given through a profit yielding vocation.
('72', 287, 1, 6, 530349) In other words vocations should serve a double purpose—to enable the pupil to pay for his tuition through the products of his labour and at the same time to develop the whole man or woman in him or her through the vocation learnt at school.
('72', 287, 1, 7, 530590) Land, buildings and equipment are not intended to be covered by the proceeds of the pupil’s labour.
('72', 287, 1, 8, 530690) All the processes of cotton, wool and silk, commencing from gathering, cleaning, ginning (in the case of cotton), carding, spinning, dyeing, sizing, warp making, double twisting, designing and weaving, embroidery, tailoring, paper making, cutting, bookbinding, cabinet making, toy making, gur making are undoubtedly occupations that can easily be learnt and handled without much capital outlay.
('72', 287, 1, 9, 531085) This primary education should equip boys and girls to earn their bread, by the State guaranteeing employment in the vocations learnt or by buying their manufactures at prices fixed by the State.
('72', 287, 1, 10, 531280) 4. Higher education should be left to private enterprise and for meeting national requirements whether in the various industries, technical arts, belles lettres or fine arts.
('72', 287, 1, 11, 531455) The State Universities should be purely examining bodies, self supporting through the fees charged for examinations.
('72', 287, 1, 12, 531572) Universities will look after the whole of the field of education and will prepare and approve courses of studies in the various departments of education.
('72', 287, 1, 13, 531726) No private school should be run without the previous sanction of the respective Universities.
('72', 287, 1, 14, 531820) University charters should be given liberally to any body of persons of proved worth and integrity, it being always understood that the Universities will not cost the State anything except that it will bear the cost of running a Central Education Department.
('72', 287, 1, 15, 532079) The foregoing scheme does not absolve the State from running such seminaries as may be required for supplying State needs.
('72', 287, 1, 16, 532202) It is claimed that if the whole scheme is accepted, it will solve the question of the greatest concern to the State—training of its youth, its future makers.

('72', 288, 2, 3, 532434) PRAISE FROM THE HIGHEST Thus runs an A. P. message 1 from Calicut:
('72', 288, 3, 4, 532501) In a statement issued today His Holiness Azhvancheri Thampurakkal, who is considered as the highest of the Brahmins in Kerala, says: “The Temple entry Proclamation 2 issued by His Highness the Maharaja of Travan core has resuscitated Hinduism, without in the least deviating from its essential ideals.” His Holiness considers that the Proclamation will shine resplendent through the ages as the most perfect doctrine of varnashrama dharma.
('72', 288, 4, 5, 532941) His Holiness also points out that the Proclamation has rooted out the evils of untouchability, disharmony and inequality among the Hindus, and as such His Holiness welcomes all the principles laid down in the Proclamation.
('72', 288, 4, 6, 533164) His Holiness is of opinion that it in no way contravenes the Vedic injunctions or Shastric ordinances.
('72', 288, 5, 7, 533267) His Holiness Azhvancheri Thampurakkal is the last resort of appeal in caste matters, according to the history of Kerala written by the historian Padmanabha Menon.
('72', 288, 5, 8, 533430) I tender my congratulations to His Holiness on his courageously ranging himself on the side of truth and progress.
('72', 288, 5, 9, 533545) It is to be hoped that if he is “the last resort of appeal in caste matters” his opinion will be respected and adopted by orthodoxy at least in Kerala if not elsewhere.
('72', 288, 6, 10, 533714) HARIJAN SERVICE IN SIMLA There has been in Simla for the past five years the Valmiki (Harijan) Young Men’s Association.
('72', 288, 6, 11, 533834) Its Honorary Director is Pt. C. V. Viswanathan.
('72', 288, 6, 12, 533882) Its Honorary Secretary is Lala B. Lachman Singh Sabhotra, himself a Valmiki Harijan.
('72', 288, 6, 13, 533967) It runs during summer a free night school open to all communities.
('72', 288, 6, 14, 534034) Of its twenty one students, eight are caste Hindus.
('72', 288, 6, 15, 534086) The school has three Harijan teachers teaching all castes.
('72', 288, 6, 16, 534145) It has also two caste Hindu and Sikh teachers.
('72', 288, 6, 17, 534192) The Head master is a Harijan.
('72', 288, 6, 18, 534222) The Association gives free medical relief through honorary physicians.
('72', 288, 6, 19, 534293) There is also a mutual aid fund.
('72', 288, 6, 20, 534326) Loans are granted at one pice per rupee interest.
('72', 288, 6, 21, 534376) This means 18 per cent.
('72', 288, 6, 22, 534400) I regard this as exorbitant.

('72', 289, 1, 2, 534644) the most 8 per cent.
('72', 289, 1, 3, 534665) That would no doubt mean stricter scrutiny in the giving of loans.

('72', 290, 1, 2, 535782) 367. ILLITERATES v.
('72', 290, 1, 3, 535802) LITERATES
('72', 290, 2, 4, 535812) A gentleman writes from Bombay:
('72', 290, 3, 5, 535844) The present Government has urged the Corporation to widen its franchise.
('72', 290, 3, 6, 535917) Today it is limited to the adults who pay not less than Rs. 5 rent.
('72', 290, 3, 7, 535985) It has been recommended that it should be extended to all literates.
('72', 290, 3, 8, 536054) The question now is what effect this will have on the proposal to have adult franchise for election to the Constituent Assembly.
('72', 290, 3, 9, 536183) If the Congress members now rest content with literacy franchise, would it not be a violation of the Congress principle?
('72', 290, 3, 10, 536304) There are some like me who think it expedient for the present to accept the literacy franchise.
('72', 290, 3, 11, 536400) What is our duty in the circumstances ?
('72', 290, 3, 12, 536440) In so far as this question is directly related to Congress discipline, I have no right to express an opinion on the subject.
('72', 290, 3, 13, 536565) My interpretation as a journalist I would not consider more authoritative than the interpretation of the questioner.
('72', 290, 3, 14, 536682) The opinion of the Congress President would be sufficient and should be binding in this matter.
('72', 290, 3, 15, 536778) But, let me, as one with long experience, give my opinion too for the sake of the questioner and others like him.
('72', 290, 3, 16, 536892) Anyone who thinks that he lacks the capacity or the time to take all the steps suggested by the Congress, should, I hold, take without hesitation whatever steps he can in the direction laid down by the Congress.
('72', 290, 3, 17, 537104) It is his duty to do this and there is no question of any breach of discipline.
('72', 290, 3, 18, 537184) Considering the merits of the proposal, 1 feel that while extending the franchise, it is not at all proper to confine it to literates.
('72', 290, 3, 19, 537319) It is possible that an educated young man of 21 may not at all be fit to exercise his franchise, whereas, an illiterate man of 50, experienced and sensible, may realize the value of his vote and his vote will have its own significance.
('72', 290, 3, 20, 537555) It has been daily happening that way.
('72', 290, 3, 21, 537593) There are many things taken for granted even in the Congress advocacy of adult franchise.
('72', 290, 3, 22, 537683) I am firmly convinced that the deaf and dumb, known idiots, lunatics, persons indulging in secret crimes and those suffering from incurable diseases cannot enjoy the right to vote even if they have attained the prescribed age.
('72', 290, 3, 23, 537910) Moreover, there is no reason to believe that those who have learnt to read and write have achieved something great.
('72', 290, 3, 24, 538026) I am not prepared to say that those who have not been able so far to get educated are themselves responsible for their ignorance.
('72', 290, 3, 25, 538156) It is indeed the indifference of the middle class people that is responsible for the
('72', 291, 0, 1, 538241) 292 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 291, 1, 2, 538283) ignorance of the masses.
('72', 291, 1, 3, 538308) The number of illiterate people in India has remained so large because these people have not discharged their duty.
('72', 291, 1, 4, 538424) Hence, in my view it is a double crime to give franchise to those who, by the favour of the Government, have become educated and to deny it to those who, because of the Government’s indifference, received no education.
('72', 291, 1, 5, 538643) It becomes the duty of those in power to arrange for early education of those illiterates who are entitled to exercise their votes.
('72', 291, 1, 6, 538775) Thus, on the one hand, it would mean atonement for not giving franchise to those who should have had it from the beginning, and, on the other, it would encourage efforts to educate the electorate so that voters can exercise their franchise intelligently.

('72', 291, 8, 15, 539311) He didn’t sleep the whole night.
('72', 291, 8, 16, 539344) He kept shivering.
('72', 291, 8, 17, 539363) His behaviour also has changed considerably.
('72', 291, 8, 18, 539408) The temperature is all right.
('72', 291, 8, 19, 539438) It is 98º.

('72', 294, 9, 11, 542623) MUNNALAL I have been meaning all these days to send for you and have a talk with you, but I could get no time.
('72', 294, 9, 12, 542734) I shall, therefore, feel easy in my mind only if I write down what I wanted to say.
('72', 294, 9, 13, 542818) I am eaten up by discontent at not being able to cope with the work here andyet, if I strain myself to do it all, my health which has already been weakened will deteriorate further.
('72', 294, 9, 14, 543000) What is the cause of your antipathy to Mirabehn?
('72', 294, 9, 15, 543049) Why are you not on talking terms with her?
('72', 294, 9, 16, 543092) I had asked her to examine the children and also to inspect carding, etc.
('72', 294, 9, 17, 543166) Accordingly she gave me the accompanying note.
('72', 294, 9, 18, 543213) That must have been six or seven days ago.
('72', 294, 9, 19, 543256) If there is any exaggeration in it, we may ignore it, but it is bound to contain something useful also.
('72', 294, 9, 20, 543360) She is always exact and methodical in her work.
('72', 294, 9, 21, 543408) I should like you to submit to her supervision.
('72', 294, 9, 22, 543456) If you can’t bear her oral criticism, I would ask her to write it down from time to time and I would pass it on to you.
('72', 294, 9, 23, 543576) But if you cannot tolerate even her silent supervision, I will stop her doing that also.
('72', 294, 9, 24, 543665) Are you fully satisfied with your present performance?
('72', 294, 9, 25, 543720) Have you anything to say about the school?

('72', 295, 1, 4, 543963) Do you have the time for it?
('72', 295, 1, 5, 543992) Do you have the capacity?
('72', 295, 1, 6, 544018) I will be satisfied even if you carry to perfection the work you are doing now.
('72', 295, 1, 7, 544098) Anyone who attains perfection even in the smallest job can get satisfaction from it.
('72', 295, 1, 8, 544183) You may reply to this either orally when you find me free or in writing.
('72', 295, 1, 9, 544256) From today I have decided to dispose of the work also by writing as I am doing now.

('72', 295, 5, 20, 544867) The experiment being conducted on Kanam 1 is sure to benefit him.
('72', 295, 5, 21, 544933) And if it is carried on with proper understanding, it will not only benefit him but benefit you also a good deal and make my task very much easier.

('72', 296, 7, 17, 546017) While learning Hindi, do not fail to give the fullest attention to its grammar.
('72', 296, 7, 18, 546097) Learning grammar develops one’s understanding.
('72', 296, 7, 19, 546144) There is little in it to be memorized.
('72', 296, 7, 20, 546183) Much of it requires only intellectual understanding.
('72', 296, 7, 21, 546236) And once one’s understanding has developed, learning grammar becomes an interesting work.
('72', 296, 7, 22, 546326) Grammar is the science of language.
('72', 296, 7, 23, 546362) It is very easy, and interesting too, to learn the structure of sentences and the etymology of words.
('72', 296, 7, 24, 546464) I had a letter from Manilal and Sushila which I am enclosing with this.
('72', 296, 7, 25, 546536) You will know about Ramdas from that letter.
('72', 296, 7, 26, 546581) He seems to be quite cheerful there.
('72', 296, 7, 27, 546618) I got Umiyashankar’s telegram for the Rentiabaras 3 day.
('72', 296, 7, 28, 546675) It also refers to Ramdas.
('72', 296, 7, 29, 546701) I infer from it that Ramdas has gone there too.
('72', 296, 7, 30, 546749) Umiyashankar says that Ramdas is keeping quite well.
('72', 296, 7, 31, 546802) You may therefore take this as the latest information about Ramdas’s state of

('72', 297, 1, 5, 547292) I am keeping well enough.
('72', 297, 1, 6, 547318) I cannot say I am perfectly well.
('72', 297, 1, 7, 547352) The brain easily gets tired.
('72', 297, 1, 8, 547381) Chimanlal is laid low with typhoid.
('72', 297, 1, 9, 547417) But the fever is slowly going down now.
('72', 297, 1, 10, 547457) There is no cause for worry, therefore.
('72', 297, 1, 11, 547497) This is the third week.
('72', 297, 1, 12, 547521) We are quite a few here.
('72', 297, 1, 13, 547546) Lilavati’s tonsils have been removed.
('72', 297, 1, 14, 547584) She suffered a good deal.
('72', 297, 1, 15, 547610) She is still at Maganwadi.
('72', 297, 1, 16, 547637) She will return here in a day or two.
('72', 297, 1, 17, 547675) I think it will be quite good if you sit for the examination.
('72', 297, 1, 18, 547737) That will give you an opportunity to improve your study, extend your reading and will also raise your price.
('72', 297, 1, 19, 547846) We certainly want our price to be raised.

('72', 299, 9, 14, 550474) You are alone there and in a foreign land where everything is strange.
('72', 299, 9, 15, 550545) And moreover you have the burden of the .
('72', 299, 9, 16, 550587) 3 affair weighing on you.
('72', 299, 9, 17, 550613) Shankar, therefore, thinks that if I write to you occasionally it may cheer you up.
('72', 299, 9, 18, 550697) I agree.
('72', 299, 9, 19, 550706) That he worries so much about you is a good sign for you.
('72', 299, 9, 20, 550764) But when one has gone so far away from home, why should one need cheering up from anybody?
('72', 299, 9, 21, 550855) Anybody who goes to a foreign country, thousands of miles away, should have the strength to find peace in his or her own mind.
('72', 299, 9, 22, 550982) I presume you have that strength.
('72', 299, 9, 23, 551016) And if you don’t have it, cultivate such peace.
('72', 299, 9, 24, 551064) God is never away from one who believes in Him.
('72', 299, 9, 25, 551112) He is nearer to one than even one’s finger nail, for He dwells in each and every fibre of our being.
('72', 299, 9, 26, 551213) He is witness to the most secret outpourings of our heart.
('72', 299, 9, 27, 551272) He does not care whether we believe in Him or not, nor does He care even if we keep away from Him, since He has full control over us.

('72', 300, 5, 11, 551958) NARAHARI, I have your letter.
('72', 300, 5, 12, 551988) If we allow confectioner etc., from outside without making it a condition that they will use only cow’s milk or ghee made out of such milk, it will certainly be wrong.
('72', 300, 5, 13, 552156) We should collect ghee from outside also if possible.
('72', 300, 5, 14, 552210) If we allow confectioners, etc., we should control their prices.
('72', 300, 5, 15, 552275) If they have to pay more for milk, etc., we may permit them to charge proportionately higher prices.
('72', 300, 5, 16, 552376) There cannot be any competition within the camp, of course.
('72', 300, 5, 17, 552436) People, therefore, are sure to pay whatever reasonable prices we fix.
('72', 300, 5, 18, 552506) Our major difficulty will perhaps be about non vegetarian food.
('72', 300, 5, 19, 552570) I don’t know what was the arrangement in Faizpur 1. Even if supply of meat was not arranged in the camp, it must have been available in Faizpur proper.
('72', 300, 5, 20, 552722) We have selected a place where what we do not provide will not be available.
('72', 300, 5, 21, 552799) Please think over this.
('72', 300, 5, 22, 552823) Discuss this with Sardar also.
('72', 300, 5, 23, 552854) If, at the time of the Education Conference, you cannot stay on after the session is over, we shall not be able to have any discussion.
('72', 300, 5, 24, 552990) And on the 25th morning I will have to leave for Calcutta.
('72', 300, 5, 25, 553049) We shall not, therefore, get any time.
('72', 300, 5, 26, 553088) Perhaps if you could arrive a day or two earlier, we can have some discussion.
('72', 300, 5, 27, 553167) I assume that you will be making a fairly substantial contribution to the Conference.

('72', 302, 2, 3, 554785) SEGAON, WARDHA, October 8, 1937
('72', 302, 3, 4, 554817) AMBUJAM, 1
('72', 302, 4, 5, 554828) I am glad you wrote to me in Hindi.
('72', 302, 4, 6, 554864) The writing is good perfectly legible, and the language quite good.
('72', 302, 4, 7, 554932) As I narrowly look at the writing at the time of dictating this, I see that though it is good, and legible, it admits of correction and improvement.
('72', 302, 4, 8, 555081) When you can at all get away for a few days, with parents’ full consent and blessings, do not hesitate to come for fear of getting ill here.
('72', 302, 4, 9, 555222) I have no such fear.
('72', 302, 4, 10, 555243) You will eat exactly as you like—you will bring your cooker and prepare the food for yourself.
('72', 302, 4, 11, 555338) I fear you cannot come here before the end of November, for I am likely to be away during November in the Frontier.
('72', 302, 4, 12, 555454) I need prolonged mental rest much more than physical.
('72', 302, 4, 13, 555508) I am taking as much as is possible, but I can afford to take more.
('72', 302, 4, 14, 555575) I am taxing my mind as to Raghavan’s substitute.
('72', 302, 4, 15, 555624) I had myself thought of you.
('72', 302, 4, 16, 555653) You have always been diffident—have always underestimated your ability—but, if you will take courage in both your hands, you will make quite a good Director 2. Try —if you feel unequal to it you will resign.
('72', 302, 4, 17, 555861) After all, in difficulties, you will fall back upon me—not merely as your guide but as the official head of the organization.
('72', 302, 4, 18, 555987) You have sufficient knowledge of Hindi, you like the work, you know most of the work, you are scrupulously conscientious, you have powers of application and are quite capable of exercising independent judgement when you want to.
('72', 302, 4, 19, 556216) There is, therefore, no cause for diffidence.
('72', 302, 4, 20, 556262) You must shed false modesty.
('72', 302, 4, 21, 556291) Therefore, if there is room for you to reconsider, you should do so, and straightaway go and see Rajagopalachari and seek his advice.
('72', 302, 4, 22, 556425) I do not want you to accept the post, if, for any reason, he does not like my idea.
('72', 302, 4, 23, 556509) I had your special basket of fruit.
('72', 302, 4, 24, 556545) But what I can manage is not the especially expensive fruit that you sent me but oranges and limes.
('72', 302, 4, 25, 556645) There are never extra good oranges in Wardha, and never the rich limes you get there.
('72', 302, 4, 26, 556731) And just now I am using here nearly 3 doz.
('72', 302, 4, 27, 556774) oranges a day and at least 1 doz.

('72', 303, 5, 10, 557332) I thoroughly agree with you about your remarks on culture leagues, etc.

('72', 303, 9, 15, 557526) October 8, 1937 You do not want a reply from me but I cannot restrain myself.
('72', 303, 9, 16, 557604) You may run away even from those who love you.
('72', 303, 9, 17, 557651) But what about them?
('72', 303, 9, 18, 557672) And are you sure that you can create a bar between yourself and your species?
('72', 303, 9, 19, 557750) You can no more run away from men than you can from your own body.
('72', 303, 9, 20, 557817) Wherever you go, embodied life will haunt you.
('72', 303, 9, 21, 557864) Embodied being can only see the Being through embodied life.
('72', 303, 9, 22, 557925) He is not outside it.
('72', 303, 9, 23, 557947) Upanishads are fragments of true human experiences.
('72', 303, 9, 24, 557999) Will you contemplate the Ishopanishad?

('72', 303, 10, 27, 558181) Nariman’s case is still going on.
('72', 303, 10, 28, 558215) Very good that Nabi Baksh is well—Bapu sends him his love.
('72', 303, 10, 29, 558274) Bapu wrote to Govinddas and wired to him also that he might come here on 11th or 12th.

('72', 304, 6, 9, 558812) I shall perhaps have to be in Calcutta from 26th to 30th.
('72', 304, 6, 10, 558870) I will return here, of course, but soon after I shall be leaving for the Frontier Province.
('72', 304, 6, 11, 558962) If, therefore, you can come, do so just now.
('72', 304, 6, 12, 559007) I don’t know where we shall meet afterwards.
('72', 304, 6, 13, 559052) Even if you come to Calcutta, what will be the use?
('72', 304, 6, 14, 559104) I won’t have time there even to look at you.
('72', 304, 6, 15, 559149) Chimanlal is better now.
('72', 304, 6, 16, 559174) He is still in bed, but the temperature has come down to almost normal.
('72', 304, 6, 17, 559246) I am better.
('72', 304, 6, 18, 559259) The pressure of work is fairly heavy.

('72', 304, 6, 20, 559335) Perhaps she will still be there when you get this.

('72', 305, 2, 3, 559883) SEGAON, October 8, 1937
('72', 305, 3, 4, 559907) NANAVATI, I told Mirabehn to note down the many things which she felt called for criticism.
('72', 305, 3, 5, 559999) The note is enclosed.
('72', 305, 3, 6, 560021) As a matter of fact, some of them fall within Dahyabhai’s sphere of work and some within Vijaya’s.
('72', 305, 3, 7, 560120) Perhaps there is nothing at all in this for which you are directly responsible.
('72', 305, 3, 8, 560200) But because you are the manager, all this should come to you for implementation at any rate.
('72', 305, 3, 9, 560293) Mirabehn, of course, had suggested that she herself should give it to you.
('72', 305, 3, 10, 560368) But I disapproved of it.
('72', 305, 3, 11, 560393) If she were to be dissatisfied with any explanation given by you, I would have to listen to that again.
('72', 305, 3, 12, 560497) If some of her words hurt you, you might not let them reach my ears but even so the pain would be there.
('72', 305, 3, 13, 560602) I have adopted this course in order to avoid that dilemma.
('72', 305, 3, 14, 560661) Many of Mirabehn’s suggestions are useful and worth considering.
('72', 305, 3, 15, 560726) All of them are indeed good, but there may be an element of exaggeration in some of them for which I would excuse her.
('72', 305, 3, 16, 560845) I intend to encourage Mirabehn to bring such things to my notice.
('72', 305, 3, 17, 560911) But she will talk only to me and, therefore, there will be no possibility of any tension arising.
('72', 305, 3, 18, 561009) I will make whatever suggestion or take whatever steps I wish to on the basis of what she tells me.
('72', 305, 3, 19, 561109) Please discuss this with Dahyabhai.
('72', 305, 3, 20, 561145) Show Vijaya whatever concerns her.

('72', 306, 4, 6, 561847) SEGAON, October 8, 1937 DEAR TANDONJI, I have gone through all your letters.
('72', 306, 4, 7, 561924) All I had heard was that you had taken a liberal decision with regard to language.
('72', 306, 4, 8, 562007) I had read nothing at all.
('72', 306, 4, 9, 562034) I had also seen the brief Press report of your statement at the time you took your seat as Speaker.
('72', 306, 4, 10, 562134) These days I am able to give hardly five to seven minutes to the newspapers.
('72', 306, 4, 11, 562211) At times I cannot manage even that much.The burden of work has greatly increased since I placed before you my new ideas about education, and the need for rest is always there.
('72', 306, 4, 12, 562387) None the less, when Kaka Saheb left with me the treasure sent by you, it became my duty to read it.
('72', 306, 4, 13, 562487) I liked all of it immensely: your speech as the Speaker, your decision about language and your speech on that subject.
('72', 306, 4, 14, 562606) Both struck me as being original.
('72', 306, 4, 15, 562640) It is all to the good that you accepted the position of Speaker.
('72', 306, 4, 16, 562705) I also received the telegram concerning me.
('72', 306, 4, 17, 562749) I had not seen anything else.
('72', 306, 4, 18, 562779) It was good that you sent the report about it.
('72', 306, 4, 19, 562826) I deliberately did not answer the telegram.
('72', 306, 4, 20, 562870) This year there were so many telegrams from all parts of the world that I was astonished and I considered it grace of God.
('72', 306, 4, 21, 562993) I Sent a brief message of thanks through the Press.
('72', 306, 4, 22, 563045) 1 I decided not to reply to anyone personally.
('72', 306, 4, 23, 563092) And what reply could I have given in words?
('72', 306, 4, 24, 563136) Such abundance of love can only be acknowledged through action.
('72', 306, 4, 25, 563200) Let us see in what way God uses me as His instrument.

('72', 307, 2, 3, 563546) SEGAON, WARDHA, [Before October 9, 1937] 1
('72', 307, 3, 4, 563589) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, I don’t see any chance of my meeting Jinnah at present.
('72', 307, 3, 5, 563663) Jawaharlal doesn’t desire it.
('72', 307, 3, 6, 563693) It seems I shall have to go to Calcutta.
('72', 307, 3, 7, 563734) Jawaharlal is very keen that I should go, and so are the Bengal leaders.
('72', 307, 3, 8, 563807) I have had a letter from Subhas, too.
('72', 307, 3, 9, 563845) And if I go, I can see the detenus also.
('72', 307, 3, 10, 563886) We are, therefore, sure to meet during the journey or, if not during the journey, at any rate in Calcutta.
('72', 307, 3, 11, 563993) It will be better if you yourself write to Bahadurji regarding the Nariman case and request him to expedite it.
('72', 307, 3, 12, 564105) If we cannot gain control over the turbulent wind that is blowing, I am afraid the game will be lost completely.
('72', 307, 3, 13, 564218) We should try our best to gain that control.
('72', 307, 3, 14, 564263) If people don’t listen to us, we shall have no option but to leave.
('72', 307, 3, 15, 564331) A few persons having control at a few points in the present set up will not serve our purpose.
('72', 307, 3, 16, 564426) We shall be able to continue to work only if we have control over the whole organization.
('72', 307, 3, 17, 564516) We will try our best to preserve such control.
('72', 307, 3, 18, 564563) I altogether forgot to write to you about Sadananda 2. He had come to see me.
('72', 307, 3, 19, 564641) He wanted to resume publication of the paper and organize a news agency.
('72', 307, 3, 20, 564714) I refused to give him any encouragement in that.
('72', 307, 3, 21, 564763) I tried to persuade him not to embark on such a futile venture and, whatever he decided, I asked him to leave me out of it.
('72', 307, 3, 22, 564887) He has agreed to do the latter.
('72', 307, 3, 23, 564919) He didn’t seem to have repented anything.
('72', 307, 3, 24, 564961) My view is that it is not worth embarking on the venture of another English newspaper in Bombay.
('72', 307, 3, 25, 565058) We must certainly reply to Nimbkar 3. I had only meant that I could do nothing on the basis of the newspaper report.

('72', 308, 2, 3, 565529) This is the gist of the conversation of a visitor: You may not know what Ministers have to go through just now.
('72', 308, 2, 4, 565641) Congressmen, having abjured office for seventeen years, suddenly find that their own chosen representatives are in possession of powers which they had voluntarily surrendered before.
('72', 308, 2, 5, 565824) They do not know what to do with these representatives.
('72', 308, 2, 6, 565880) They smother them with addresses and entertainments and, as often as not, they demand interviews with them as a matter of right and present them with all kinds of suggestions and sometimes even ask for petty favours.
('72', 308, 2, 7, 566097) This is the best way to disable the Ministers from doing real service to the country.
('72', 308, 2, 8, 566183) They are new to their work.
('72', 308, 2, 9, 566211) A conscientious Minister has no time for receiving addresses and honours, or for making speeches in return for fulsome or deserved praise.
('72', 308, 2, 10, 566350) Nor have they time for interviewers whom they do not invite, or who they think are not going to help them in their work.
('72', 308, 2, 11, 566471) In theory, a leader of democracy holds himself at the beck and call of the public.
('72', 308, 2, 12, 566554) It is but right that he should do so.
('72', 308, 2, 13, 566592) But he dare not do so at the sacrifice of the duty imposed upon him by the public.
('72', 308, 2, 14, 566675) Ministers will cut a sorry figure if they do not master, or are not allowed by the public to master, the work entrusted to them.
('72', 308, 2, 15, 566804) An Education Minister has to have all his wits about him if he is to evolve a policy in keeping with the requirements of the country.
('72', 308, 2, 16, 566938) An Excise Minister will prove a disastrous failure if he does not attend to the constructive side of prohibition.
('72', 308, 2, 17, 567052) And so will a Finance Minister who, in spite of the handicap created for him by the [Government of] India Act and in spite of the voluntary surrender of the Excise Revenue, will not balance his budget.
('72', 308, 2, 18, 567254) It requires a juggler in figures to be able to do so.
('72', 308, 2, 19, 567308) These are but illustrations.
('72', 308, 2, 20, 567337) Every ministerial office requires almost the same vigilance, care and study as the three I have mentioned.
('72', 308, 2, 21, 567444) It would have been easy for them, if they had simply to read and sign papers put before them by the permanent Service.
('72', 308, 2, 22, 567563) But it is not easy to study every document and think out and originate new policies.
('72', 308, 2, 23, 567648) Their gesture of simplicity, necessary as it was as a preliminary, will avail them nothing if they will not show the requisite industry, ability, integrity, impartiality, and an infinite capacity for mastering details.
('72', 308, 2, 24, 567867) It would be well, therefore, if the public will exercise self restraint in the matter of giving addresses, seeking interviews or writing to them long epistles.

('72', 309, 2, 3, 568115) Bhausaheb Lavate 1 has been honouring me with a visit in the interest of prohibition which is as dear to him as to me.
('72', 309, 2, 4, 568234) We came to the following conclusions: 1. Strict non use from now of all Excise Revenue for any but prohibition purposes.
('72', 309, 2, 5, 568355) 2. Non renewal of all licences on their expiry and immediate closing of all liquor shops, where there is a clear demand for closing on the part of at least 75% of those who have been visiting these shops.
('72', 309, 2, 6, 568560) 3. Liquor, whenever it is necessary to sell it, should be sold only through direct Government agency.
('72', 309, 2, 7, 568662) 4. All existing liquor shops should be, wherever possible, converted into refreshment and recreation rooms.
('72', 309, 2, 8, 568770) 5. Causes of the habit in typical areas should be carefully investigated and dealt with.
('72', 309, 2, 9, 568859) 6. Absolutely peaceful, silent and educative picketing by recognized individuals or groups should be undertaken, the object being to establish intimate personal contact with the addicts so as to help them to give up the habit.
('72', 309, 2, 10, 569086) Personal visits to the addicts in their own homes would be a feature of scientific picketing.
('72', 309, 2, 11, 569180) Voluntary agency for this work should be invited by the Government and encouraged to do this philanthropic work.

('72', 310, 4, 10, 570456) MY DEAR GURJALE, I appreciate the frankness of the last part of your letter.
('72', 310, 4, 11, 570533) I am glad you are concentrating the minds of friends on prohibition.
('72', 310, 4, 12, 570602) I can do nothing about tea and coffee, bad as I know they are, until you give me facts and figures to support your contentions.
('72', 310, 5, 13, 570730) Yours sincerely, BAPU

('72', 310, 9, 17, 570846) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, I have just read your reply to Nimbkar.
('72', 310, 9, 18, 570904) I didn’t like it at all.
('72', 310, 9, 19, 570929) It displays great intolerance.
('72', 310, 9, 20, 570960) I think it will be very difficult to prove your accusation against him.
('72', 310, 9, 21, 571032) And where was the need to say it all?
('72', 310, 9, 22, 571070) And the attack on the [Bombay] Chronicle doesn’t become you at all.
('72', 310, 9, 23, 571138) “Obvious reasons” are reasons which everybody knows.
('72', 310, 9, 24, 571191) In the first instance I don’t know that the Chronicle always opposes you.
('72', 310, 9, 25, 571265) And even if it is true that it does, what can be the obvious reason?
('72', 310, 9, 26, 571334) What was the point in saying it?
('72', 310, 9, 27, 571367) I am afraid you have needlessly provoked

('72', 311, 9, 10, 571822) [Before October 10, 1937]
('72', 311, 11, 11, 571848) You certainly did well in coming away earlier.
('72', 311, 11, 12, 571895) I have been able
('72', 311, 12, 13, 571912) to keep myself going with the greatest effort.
('72', 311, 12, 14, 571959) My brain needs plenty of rest.
('72', 311, 12, 15, 571990) I observe silence and sleep as long as I can and remain calm so that I may not have a breakdown on the 22nd.
('72', 311, 12, 16, 572099) But please see everything here.
('72', 311, 12, 17, 572131) Observe the experiment in Nalwadi through my eyes.
('72', 311, 12, 18, 572182) Have a discussion with Kaka.
('72', 311, 12, 19, 572211) [Arya]nayakam also has grasped [the idea] well enough.
('72', 311, 12, 20, 572266) But Vinoba has done it better than anybody else.
('72', 311, 12, 21, 572315) He writes and says that he finds nothing to object to in my articles.
('72', 311, 12, 22, 572385) I have sent an extract from his letter for Harijanbandhu.2 I don’t know whether or not it is printed.
('72', 311, 14, 23, 572487) Vanamala and others were well saved.
('72', 311, 16, 24, 572524) What is the age of the student?
('72', 311, 18, 25, 572556) There would hardly be any children of very tender age in any
('72', 311, 19, 26, 572617) village school.
('72', 311, 19, 27, 572633) There are such children in the village, of course, but they do not attend school.
('72', 311, 19, 28, 572715) Here the parent s don’t send such very young children to school.
('72', 311, 19, 29, 572780) The teachers take no interest in them.
('72', 311, 19, 30, 572819) It is not my wish that they should not attend school.
('72', 311, 19, 31, 572873) I am only describing what I have observed.

('72', 312, 1, 2, 573116) 401. TWO ENDORSEMENTS OF EDUCATION THROUGH WORK Even though Vinoha and I are separated by a distance of only five miles, we hardly meet each other as we are both deep in our own work and as neither is in the best of health.
('72', 312, 1, 3, 573340) Hence, we decide many matters by correspondence.
('72', 312, 1, 4, 573389) I have quoted these ideas 1 from one such letter.
('72', 312, 1, 5, 573439) I consider these ideas very significant, because I am not aware of anyone else from among my colleagues who has carried out so many experiments in that direction as Vinoba has.
('72', 312, 1, 6, 573616) The revolutionary increase in the speed of the takli has at its root Vinoba’s inspiration and his untiring labour.
('72', 312, 1, 7, 573731) He has worked on his charkha and takli for eight to ten hours a day even though he has been managing a big organization.
('72', 312, 1, 8, 573852) And, right from the beginning he has given this craft an important place in education.
('72', 312, 1, 9, 573939) Thus, Vinoba is naturally in full agreement with me in making education self supporting through a craft which I consider to be my original discovery.
('72', 312, 1, 10, 574089) This, indeed, is a matter of great encouragement for me.
('72', 312, 1, 11, 574146) I have quoted his opinion here in the hope that it would strengthen the faith of those who know Vinoba and would inspire faith in those who have none now.
('72', 312, 1, 12, 574301) Support from Shri Vinoba is not a matter of surprise for me.
('72', 312, 1, 13, 574362) Nor would it be for readers of Harijanbandhu.
('72', 312, 1, 14, 574408) On the contrary, if I do not get his support, it should set me thinking.
('72', 312, 1, 15, 574481) It would be foolish and certainly impudent to venture to convince the nation about a point if I am not able to convince my oldest colleagues about it.
('72', 312, 1, 16, 574632) I was no doubt pleasantly surprised on receiving Shri Manu Subedar’s letter.
('72', 312, 1, 17, 574709) I have been corresponding with him on issues like education, prohibition, etc.
('72', 312, 1, 18, 574788) As a result I have the following letter 2. The reader will be happy to see it.
('72', 312, 1, 19, 574867) He had sent some suggestions in English along with the letter which I have already published in Harijan 3. [From Gujarati] Harijanbandhu, 10 10 1937
('72', 312, 2, 20, 575016) 1 Not translated here.
('72', 312, 2, 21, 575039) Vinoba Bhave had conveyed his appreciation of Gandhiji’s latest thoughts on education and had further stated that he would not have even the dualistic conception of work and education and he had therefore already started experimenting on the lines of work education.
('72', 312, 3, 22, 575306) 2 Not translated here.
('72', 312, 3, 23, 575329) The correspondent had supported basic education on financial grounds and suggested that a district wise survey should be made of locally available raw materials which, along with the necessary implements, should be supplied at the school door.

('72', 313, 2, 3, 575698) PROHIBITION IN AHMEDABAD The Government of the Bombay Presidency has taken the welcome decision of introducing total prohibition from the 1st of April.
('72', 313, 2, 4, 575850) This is no doubt a correct step.
('72', 313, 2, 5, 575883) As Ahmedabad is one of those fields where this thing has been well tried, this experiment should meet with easy success there.
('72', 313, 2, 6, 576010) The aim of prohibition is that people may stop taking alcohol.
('72', 313, 2, 7, 576073) If people do not give up the habit, illicit distillation will go on and the addicts will persist in drinking, and the prohibition law will have failed.
('72', 313, 2, 8, 576225) Thus, although people cannot be made to give up drinking unless the drinking booths are closed down, the mere closing down of the booths will bring no result unless people are convinced through education of the evils of alcoholism.
('72', 313, 2, 9, 576457) The largest number of alcoholics in Ahmedabad comes from the working class.
('72', 313, 2, 10, 576533) The Majoor Mahajan deserves to be congratulated on having undertaken the responsibility of educating the public and on having passed the necessary resolution.
('72', 313, 2, 11, 576692) If men and women take upon themselves the individual responsibility and carry on this work, it is sure to meet with success.
('72', 313, 2, 12, 576817) If success is achieved in a centre like Ahmedabad, other parts of India will also be encouraged and they will also learn how success can be achieved.

('72', 313, 6, 17, 577081) Only yesterday I heard that you had been suffering from unabating fever for four days.
('72', 313, 6, 18, 577168) How come?
('72', 313, 6, 19, 577178) Is it because you got married?
('72', 313, 6, 20, 577209) I believed you could never fall ill.
('72', 313, 6, 21, 577246) What has happened then?
('72', 313, 6, 22, 577270) I hope to get some good news even today.
('72', 313, 6, 23, 577311) This is being dictated at 5 a.m.

('72', 314, 1, 3, 577682) I hope you will not let me down now.
('72', 314, 1, 4, 577719) Relax and get well soon.
('72', 314, 1, 5, 577744) Could it be that the strain of the Conference has told on your health?
('72', 314, 1, 6, 577815) If it is so, take refuge in Mother Gita and free yourself from attachment and anxiety.

('72', 314, 13, 21, 578439) Of course prohibition applies to both drinks and drugs.
('72', 314, 13, 22, 578495) There is no question in the seven Provinces of carrying conviction.
('72', 314, 13, 23, 578563) The Ministers would know how to deal with the matter.

('72', 316, 9, 10, 580188) MY DEAR REBEL, It has been impossible to write to you during the week days in spite of your gentle complaint.
('72', 316, 9, 11, 580298) I must not use the right hand and the left works laboriously.
('72', 316, 9, 12, 580360) And I have no time for practice.
('72', 316, 9, 13, 580393) Every minute must be used to best advantage.
('72', 316, 9, 14, 580438) If you insist on my tearing your letters as soon as I have read them, you must not expect me to remember your questions for whole seven days and then answer them on Sundays.
('72', 316, 9, 15, 580612) Of course I took note of what you wrote about Bhulabhai 1 and 2, what is more, I wrote to him about the matter, though of course without naming the source of information.
('72', 316, 9, 16, 580783) I have not heard from him as yet.
('72', 316, 9, 17, 580817) The reply is overdue.
('72', 316, 9, 18, 580839) I had heard of the thing before but I could not act upon rumours.
('72', 316, 9, 19, 580905) Your information was definite.
('72', 316, 9, 20, 580936) I am glad Nabibux has returned.
('72', 316, 9, 21, 580968) My love to him.
('72', 316, 9, 22, 580984) You must bring him when you come.
('72', 316, 9, 23, 581018) Your cheque has gone to Delhi.
('72', 316, 9, 24, 581049) You may expect a formal receipt from them.
('72', 316, 9, 25, 581092) Not to make mistakes in simple account keeping does not make one an accountant.
('72', 316, 9, 26, 581172) Even illiterate Nabibux gives an accurate account of everything he spends.
('72', 316, 9, 27, 581247) You may take unction to your soul in that you are as good as he is in taking

('72', 317, 1, 4, 581481) It is a mystery how Sir J’s letter 1 was not in your cover.
('72', 317, 1, 5, 581541) Mira is making a search.
('72', 317, 1, 6, 581566) Remember she is not a clerk, nor an idiot.
('72', 317, 1, 7, 581609) Idiots are good at remembering things.
('72', 317, 1, 8, 581648) Mira can draw mountains and cloud effects.
('72', 317, 1, 9, 581691) So she disdains to remember trifles like putting things in their places where they should be.
('72', 317, 1, 10, 581785) But this is poor consolation for you and me.
('72', 317, 1, 11, 581830) I was most anxious for you to see that very good letter.
('72', 317, 1, 12, 581887) He is following it up faithfully.

('72', 317, 1, 14, 581947) I return you the enclosed duly signed “Bapu” in Hindi.
('72', 317, 1, 15, 582002) Is that right?
('72', 317, 1, 16, 582017) Vijaya was wanted by her parents and I had to send her away.
('72', 317, 1, 17, 582078) She was most disconsolate and could not restrain her tears.
('72', 317, 1, 18, 582138) 2 I miss her because she was a most handy girl, always willing, always ready.
('72', 317, 1, 19, 582216) She wants to return.
('72', 317, 1, 20, 582237) A. S. is still in Bombay helping her brothers to settle their differences.
('72', 317, 1, 21, 582312) She may return any day.
('72', 317, 1, 22, 582336) Lilavati is almost in harness.
('72', 317, 1, 23, 582367) Sushila, P[yarelal]’s sister, came in on Saturday bringing fever with her.
('72', 317, 1, 24, 582442) So she is in Maganwadi.
('72', 317, 1, 25, 582466) Pyarelal is nursing her.
('72', 317, 1, 26, 582491) Shriman is down with typhus.
('72', 317, 1, 27, 582520) I do not know what will happen to the Conference now.
('72', 317, 1, 28, 582574) It may have to be dropped.
('72', 317, 1, 29, 582601) He is a rare gem.
('72', 317, 1, 30, 582619) On 25th I leave for Calcutta; address care Congress.
('72', 317, 1, 31, 582672) I expect to be back on 2nd November at the latest and shall await Khan Saheb’s summons.
('72', 317, 1, 32, 582760) He expects to have me with him during 1st week of November.

('72', 318, 3, 4, 583092) SITA 1, Your handwriting is very beautiful indeed.
('72', 318, 3, 5, 583143) Write Gujarati also in an equally beautiful hand.
('72', 318, 3, 6, 583193) Write in both the languages.
('72', 318, 3, 7, 583222) I hope you will show us your face some day.
('72', 318, 3, 8, 583266) If you were here Kanam would get company and I would teach you according to the new method.

('72', 318, 7, 14, 583510) October 11, 1937
('72', 318, 8, 15, 583527) MANILAL AND SUSHILA,
('72', 318, 9, 16, 583548) Your letters are regular and quite informative.
('72', 318, 9, 17, 583596) I have no grounds for complaint; you have some.
('72', 318, 9, 18, 583644) My hands are so full that I missed the last mail.
('72', 318, 9, 19, 583694) Only today I am snatching the time.
('72', 318, 9, 20, 583730) I am writing to Ramdas separately at Johannesburg.
('72', 318, 9, 21, 583781) It is certainly unfortunate that he could not stay with you.
('72', 318, 9, 22, 583842) But Kallenbach 2 thought of Ramdas only.
('72', 318, 9, 23, 583883) His has been military [discipline] always.
('72', 318, 9, 24, 583926) We should not grieve over it.
('72', 318, 9, 25, 583956) I understand what you say about the Agent.
('72', 318, 9, 26, 583999) We have to suffer many such things.
('72', 318, 9, 27, 584035) If we can remain unaffected by these experiences, we have learnt our dharma and the art of living in this world.
('72', 318, 9, 28, 584148) The sweet and bitter experiences that you are having there are also common here.
('72', 318, 9, 29, 584229) They make up the variety of this world.
('72', 318, 9, 30, 584269) If one gets a bed of roses every day, would one attach any value to it?
('72', 318, 9, 31, 584341) Hence the great need for religious meditation, reading, and conduct.
('72', 318, 9, 32, 584410) You may come if you can—both or either of you.

('72', 319, 6, 11, 584964) I hope you have been visiting Shriman.
('72', 319, 6, 12, 585003) I am worried about Sushila.
('72', 319, 6, 13, 585031) I hear that her fever has still not come down.
('72', 319, 6, 14, 585078) This means more work for you.
('72', 319, 6, 15, 585108) And the 22nd and 25th are approaching.
('72', 319, 6, 16, 585147) Please see that you don’t overexert yourself.
('72', 319, 6, 17, 585193) Keep Shanta under control.
('72', 319, 6, 18, 585220) It will be a blow if she spoils her health.

('72', 319, 12, 24, 585447) Mira also has not been able to read it.
('72', 319, 12, 25, 585487) Please go through it carefully.
('72', 319, 12, 26, 585519) I don’t wish to detain Janba here.
('72', 319, 12, 27, 585554) I had enclosed Sir Jogendra’s letter with the letter to Rajkumari.
('72', 319, 12, 28, 585621) She did not receive it.
('72', 319, 12, 29, 585645) Did Mira forget it or was it left out there?
('72', 319, 12, 30, 585690) Please inquire.

('72', 320, 7, 13, 586246) JAMNALALJI, I have your letter.
('72', 320, 7, 14, 586278) Bahadurji is welcome.
('72', 320, 7, 15, 586300) I have learnt about Shriman’s fever.
('72', 320, 7, 16, 586337) It is a bad one.
('72', 320, 7, 17, 586354) It seems obstinate.
('72', 320, 7, 18, 586374) I am hoping to go and see him today.
('72', 320, 7, 19, 586411) I am dictating this letter after the morning prayer.
('72', 320, 7, 20, 586464) Because of Shriman’s illness, Mahadev and Kishorelal suggested to me that the Education Conference be postponed.
('72', 320, 7, 21, 586577) The suggestion appealed to me.
('72', 320, 7, 22, 586608) The responsibility of accommodating a hundred persons ought not to be on you.
('72', 320, 7, 23, 586686) I assume that you will foot the bill.
('72', 320, 7, 24, 586724) I don’t mind that.
('72', 320, 7, 25, 586743) But if the other people cannot shoulder the burdens of managing such gatherings without your help, I think we ought not to have them at all.
('72', 320, 7, 26, 586884) Our work in these gatherings will shine only if the others have acquired the ability to manage them.
('72', 320, 7, 27, 586985) I have, therefore, sent a message to Aryanayakam that he should let the plan for the Conference stand only if he has the necessary self confidence and ability.
('72', 320, 7, 28, 587145) Otherwise it had better be postponed.
('72', 320, 7, 29, 587183) The Conference was Shriman’s idea and I had depended on him alone.
('72', 320, 7, 30, 587250) As long as he was in normal health I didn’t worry.
('72', 320, 7, 31, 587301) I had assumed that he would never fall ill.
('72', 320, 7, 32, 587345) When, therefore, I heard about his illness, I was upset.
('72', 320, 7, 33, 587402) I have regarded your discovery of Shriman as a wonderful one.
('72', 320, 7, 34, 587464) He has an unusual mixture of learning, maturity of judgement and humility.
('72', 320, 7, 35, 587539) Without him the Conference would give me no pleasure.
('72', 320, 7, 36, 587593) But in accordance with the principle that one should not abandon a task already begun, I have insisted that the Conference be held unless [Arya]nayakam’s
('72', 321, 0, 1, 587747) 322 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 321, 1, 2, 587789) self confidence gives way or you oppose its holding.
('72', 321, 1, 3, 587842) I would regard your opposition to be well grounded, for I have faith in your practical sense.
('72', 321, 1, 4, 587936) You alone can judge best whether, without you and the use of your bungalow, the programme of the Conference can go through successfully.
('72', 321, 1, 5, 588073) If, therefore, you wish that the Conference should be postponed, please tell me so immediately by wire.
('72', 321, 1, 6, 588177) I will then postpone it.
('72', 321, 1, 7, 588202) I hope you are keeping fit.
('72', 321, 1, 8, 588230) Savitri must be doing quite well.

('72', 321, 7, 16, 588486) You will then tell me all about the ministerial deeds in the Congress Provinces.
('72', 321, 7, 17, 588567) I do hope that the sore throat and cold were only temporary things, and that you were able to stand the strain in the Punjab.
('72', 321, 7, 18, 588693) The climate in the Frontier must be very delightful.
('72', 321, 7, 19, 588746) How I wish you would take things easy for a time at least!

('72', 321, 11, 22, 588902) October 12, 1937
('72', 321, 12, 23, 588919) MY DEAR REBEL,
('72', 321, 13, 24, 588934) Though there is nothing wrong in Hindus putting emphasis on Devanagari script and a knowledge of Hindi (if it is to be distinguished from highly Persianized Urdu), if you can postpone active work till after the Sammelan it would be wise.
('72', 321, 13, 25, 589172) This is all a matter of experience, and it is so difficult to advise without sensing the
('72', 322, 0, 1, 589261) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 323
('72', 322, 1, 2, 589305) surrounding atmosphere and the local circumstances.
('72', 322, 1, 3, 589357) Both these I like to see for myself whenever I have to decide a delicate question which depends for its solution on a knowledge of the atmosphere and circumstances.
('72', 322, 1, 4, 589522) I hope this will be some sort of guide for you.
('72', 322, 1, 5, 589570) Whatever happens, this is quite clear to me, that every Punjabi should realize that Punjabi and Urdu are his languages; but a Hindu, wherever he is, should know Hindi through the Devanagari script, for the sake of being able to read first class devotional literature, the like of which is not to be found in any other Provincial speech.
('72', 322, 1, 6, 589907) I do not know what the approach of the Hindi Pracharini Sabha is.
('72', 322, 1, 7, 589973) It may be wholly different from mine.
('72', 322, 1, 8, 590011) If that is so the decision as to the propriety of carrying on propaganda will be different from what I have given.
('72', 322, 1, 9, 590126) How is it that you have found Sardar Jogendra Singh’s letter?
('72', 322, 1, 10, 590188) For in your letter of yesterday you tell me you had missed it.
('72', 322, 1, 11, 590251) This is being dictated after breaking silence.
('72', 322, 1, 12, 590298) Although I work top speed, I do not feel any fatigue.
('72', 322, 1, 13, 590352) It comes from talk.
('72', 322, 1, 14, 590372) I have just enough strength in the right hand yet to carry on Monday’s work.
('72', 322, 1, 15, 590449) I wish I could find the time for practising writing with the left hand daily, but I don’t, beyond having the time for tracing my signature to the daily letters.

('72', 322, 6, 21, 590748) DEAR DR.
('72', 322, 6, 22, 590757) GOPICHAND,
('72', 322, 7, 23, 590768) I have your letter.
('72', 322, 7, 24, 590788) I have not forgotten the Andaman Prisoners.
('72', 322, 7, 25, 590832) Where are they being treated as ‘C’ class Prisoners?
('72', 322, 7, 26, 590885) So far as I know these class distinctions are gone.
('72', 322, 7, 27, 590937) These friends should help the Congress Ministers for they have their difficulties.
('72', 322, 7, 28, 591020) You may give them the assurance that I shall strain every nerve not merely to see that they are well treated but that they are discharged.
('72', 322, 7, 29, 591159) But I must be able myself to give the assurance in every individual case.
('72', 322, 7, 30, 591233) Their noble respo nse to me has paved the way, but it ought not to be held as
('72', 323, 0, 1, 591311) 324 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 323, 1, 2, 591353) sufficient for full fruition of the common hope.
('72', 323, 1, 3, 591402) The main reason for my going to Calcutta for the A. I. C. C. is to examine the whole position, and to see what I can do in the matter.

('72', 323, 5, 8, 591680) October 13, 1937
('72', 323, 6, 9, 591697) MY DEAR REBEL, I dictated last night a long letter to you.
('72', 323, 6, 10, 591756) Now at 4.15 a.m.
('72', 323, 6, 11, 591773) I begin this about Khurshed.
('72', 323, 6, 12, 591802) Her letter and yours were destroyed as soon as I read them.
('72', 323, 6, 13, 591862) Hers is a sad case.
('72', 323, 6, 14, 591882) She writes differently to me as if she was retiring from the haunts of men.
('72', 323, 6, 15, 591958) I have written a gentle reply.
('72', 323, 6, 16, 591989) 2 Though she writes to me as if I was a stranger, 1 continue to sign myself Bapu and tell her that though she may desert me, I will not desert her.
('72', 323, 6, 17, 592137) I gave one hour to Govinddas.
('72', 323, 6, 18, 592167) 3 His admissions were compromising.
('72', 323, 6, 19, 592203) I have told him [to] investigate the truth of what has been stated to me against him.
('72', 323, 6, 20, 592289) You should not allow your favourable opinion to be affected by my unfavourable impressions.
('72', 323, 6, 21, 592381) More when we meet, if you would remind me.
('72', 323, 6, 22, 592424) I hope you threw off your cold long ago.
('72', 323, 6, 23, 592465) Why should [you] sit with a chill on?
('72', 323, 6, 24, 592503) You should not be ashamed to sit cross legged and wrap yourself as we poor villagers do.
('72', 323, 6, 25, 592592) And then breathe deep when you are cold.
('72', 323, 6, 26, 592633) I knew about Palestine schools.

('72', 324, 12, 22, 593793) SUJNA BHAISHRI, It seems that in the State dispensary at Botad the doctors, compounders, etc., practise untouchability while examining Harijans or dispensing medicines to them and treat them with contempt.
('72', 324, 12, 23, 593999) And if any treatment is required which involves touching them, either it is not given or is given with great reluctance.
('72', 324, 12, 24, 594120) For instance, if any of them is having discharge from his ear and a syringe has to be used, some wads of cotton are thrown at the man and he is sent away and asked to clean his ear with them.

('72', 325, 1, 4, 594619) I too believe that, when most of its servants also are tainted with the evil of untouchability, the Government cannot do much.
('72', 325, 1, 5, 594746) However, some improvement in this regard is bound to take place if untouchability is openly and repeatedly discountenanced by the State authorities in its policies and declarations and through administrative action, and if action is taken against [even] a few persons guilty of practising untouchability.
('72', 325, 1, 6, 595051) Discrimination in hospitals should be impossible.

('72', 325, 6, 15, 595605) He is ambitious, vain, vulgar, crooked and unreliable.
('72', 325, 6, 16, 595660) His ventures have resulted in losses.
('72', 325, 6, 17, 595698) This is the opinion of those who have dealings with him.
('72', 325, 6, 18, 595755) I know him well.
('72', 325, 6, 19, 595772) He used to be like a son to me.
('72', 325, 6, 20, 595804) I used to think well of him.
('72', 325, 6, 21, 595833) But I soon discovered that he was a schemer.
('72', 325, 6, 22, 595878) Now he rarely comes near me.

('72', 326, 3, 5, 596345) DEAR OLD RENEGADE BUT HONEST PUPIL, I knew that you delighted in calling yourself Jaisoorya, but Mahadev was trying to pull my leg by asking me to judge who could the writer be.
('72', 326, 3, 6, 596523) He knew that with the advance of years my memory was decaying rapidly, and, trading upon that knowledge he challenged me to guess the writer’s identity.
('72', 326, 3, 7, 596676) I could not till I saw the last sentence, and I asked since when you had become Jaisoorya.
('72', 326, 3, 8, 596767) Then I thought that my memory was gradually coming back, and I said to myself that when you had come to me at Knightsbridge in that Deputation of self styled firebrands, you had sent in your name as Jaisoorya.
('72', 326, 3, 9, 596977) But at that time Mother 1 had prepared me to identify you with the bearded young man with amazing self assurance.
('72', 326, 3, 10, 597091) Your letter shows that you remain the same on the surface, but in spite of your looking down upon old fogies, you have inward regard for them, and know that you can as little do without them as without the very stupid days of your childhood.
('72', 326, 3, 11, 597333) Therefore, in spite of your profound differences with me, in which you glory, I am not going to disregard your outline.
('72', 326, 3, 12, 597453) But I am going to study it carefully, and then give you my opinion.
('72', 326, 3, 13, 597521) But you will be patient with me.
('72', 326, 3, 14, 597554) Meanwhile this comes to you with all the good wishes that you and yours may care to have, or be in need of.

('72', 327, 6, 11, 598280) [October 14, 1937] 2
('72', 327, 7, 12, 598301) Mr. Bahadurji has brought me his judgment 3 on the Nariman Sardar case which is attached hereto.
('72', 327, 7, 13, 598398) When I asked, not without much hesitation, to associate himself with me in the task I had taken up in the public interest, he readily agreed to do so.
('72', 327, 7, 14, 598549) He had, perhaps, not realized what anxious labour it would cost him to do justice to the task.
('72', 327, 7, 15, 598644) I do not know what I would have’ done without his valuable assistance.
('72', 327, 7, 16, 598715) We read his judgment together and with very slight changes I suggested, and which he readily accepted.
('72', 327, 7, 17, 598818) The judgment is absolutely his own and arrived at without any previous consultation with me.
('72', 327, 7, 18, 598911) I concur with his reasoning and finding.
('72', 327, 7, 19, 598952) The public will see that the finding is purely judicial.
('72', 327, 7, 20, 599009) Parties were given every facility to see the evidence, to take copies and were free to have witnesses orally examined and cross exarnined.
('72', 327, 7, 21, 599148) But they did not want any examination or cross examination nor was it necessary.
('72', 327, 7, 22, 599229) Though there were over eighty witnesses and the evidence was voluminous, a mass of it was wholly irrelevant to the two issues before us.
('72', 327, 7, 23, 599366) The greatest latitude was given to Mr. Nariman to bring before me any evidence he had.
('72', 327, 7, 24, 599453) I sent personal letters to witnesses, whose names he had sent me.
('72', 327, 7, 25, 599519) Most of the Congress legislators have

('72', 327, 9, 27, 599619) 2 This note was written while D. N. Bahadurji was at Segaon on the Thursday prior to October 16 which fell on October 14; vide “Self Supporting Education”
('72', 327, 10, 28, 599774) 3 In which Bahadurji had arrived at the conclusion that the “charge against K. F. Nariman in respect of the elections in 1934 was proved and the charge made by K. F. Nariman against Vallabhbhai was not proved.”
('72', 328, 0, 1, 599985) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 329
('72', 328, 1, 2, 600029) sent in their statements in answer to my public appeal for evidence.
('72', 328, 2, 3, 600098) If I had no further duty to discharge, there would be nothing more for me to say.
('72', 328, 2, 4, 600180) But I must not avoid reference to the things that have been brought to light in the course of the evidence sent to me.
('72', 328, 2, 5, 600299) Mr. Nariman has sent to me newspaper cuttings.
('72', 328, 2, 6, 600346) They have made painful reading.
('72', 328, 2, 7, 600378) There is no evidence whatsoever to show that the Sardar was actuated by any communal bias.
('72', 328, 2, 8, 600469) The newspapers, which have made suggestions that there was communal bias behind the rejection of Mr. Nariman, have rendered a great disservice to the Bombay public life and Mr. Nariman, who has himself, I am glad, rejected any such suggestion.
('72', 328, 2, 9, 600713) Indeed, Mr. Nariman’s grievances against the Sardar seem to resolve themselves into this: As the Sardar told him on the 3rd of March, he would not and did not exert himself on his behalf.
('72', 328, 2, 10, 600901) It is plain that when a person of the Sardar’s influence remains passive, his attitude was bound to go against Mr. Nariman, but for that the Sardar could not be held blameworthy.
('72', 328, 2, 11, 601080) It seems to me Mr. Nariman forgot that the City of Bombay is not the Bombay Presidency.
('72', 328, 2, 12, 601168) And if he had really the confidence of Maharashtra and Karnataka, the Sardar’s passivity would have availed nothing.
('72', 328, 2, 13, 601285) Indeed, there is nothing to prevent the legislators even now from inviting Mr. Kher 2 to resign and electing Mr. Nariman in his place.
('72', 328, 2, 14, 601420) The suggestion that the Sardar’s overpowering influence would prevent such a change is thoughtless.
('72', 328, 2, 15, 601520) Ninety men cannot be overawed for a long time by one man, however powerful he may be.
('72', 328, 2, 16, 601606) My analysis of the situation is that Mr. Nariman overestimated his hold on the legislators and felt the keenest disappointment over the defeat.
('72', 328, 2, 17, 601750) His judgment became warped.
('72', 328, 2, 18, 601778) This is evidenced by his own statements before me.
('72', 328, 2, 19, 601829) His advisers and the newspaper propaganda kept up the illusion.
('72', 328, 2, 20, 601893) It is no pleasure to me to have to pen these lines.
('72', 328, 2, 21, 601945) But I pen them in the hope that his eyes may be opened by the opening out of the agonized heart of one who has been his friend and well wisher and who was somewhat responsible for his inclusion in the Congress Cabinet.

('72', 330, 3, 4, 603350) MY DEAR JAGANNATH DAS, Kakasaheb has passed on to me your letter of 15th September.
('72', 330, 3, 5, 603434) I got it only on 12th October.
('72', 330, 3, 6, 603465) It makes very sad reading.
('72', 330, 3, 7, 603492) There never was any guarantee that more money would be found from the North 1. Nevertheless Rs. 5,000 (five thousand) have been transferred to you.
('72', 330, 3, 8, 603640) Raghavan however was never expected to find the money; he was merely to look after the administration.
('72', 330, 3, 9, 603743) But I do not at all agree with him that, on that account, he can desert the ship.
('72', 330, 3, 10, 603825) He can complain, grumble, put the responsibility on you, his colleagues, and expect you to find the sinews of war.
('72', 330, 3, 11, 603940) You can certainly pester me, pester Jamnalalji and Rajaji also.
('72', 330, 3, 12, 604004) Because he has taken up a tremendous responsibility, he cannot divest himself of the duty of discharging old obligations.
('72', 330, 3, 13, 604126) Only a gambler can take up new obligations before he has discharged existing ones, and without thinking how he will discharge old ones.
('72', 330, 3, 14, 604262) Sri R. C. is not of this type.
('72', 330, 3, 15, 604293) We would be doing him an injustice if we think that he will plead the new work to evade the old one.
('72', 330, 3, 16, 604394) Instead of seeing him, write to him.
('72', 330, 3, 17, 604431) I am writing to him myself.
('72', 330, 3, 18, 604459) You may show this to him.

('72', 332, 2, 3, 606274) A DONATION TO KHADI Dr. Pattabhi writes to me as follows:
('72', 332, 3, 4, 606332) Mula Lakshmi Narayanaswamigaru of Tadpatri, Anantapur District (Madras Presidency—Andhra), has donated Rs. 5,000 for khadi and also promised to pay up to another Rs. 45,000 as a loan at 3 per cent for work in his district.
('72', 332, 3, 5, 606555) I congratulate the donor on his donation and loan.
('72', 332, 3, 6, 606606) I have no doubt that he could not have better employed his money.
('72', 332, 3, 7, 606672) Let me hope that the district will receive the full benefit of the donation and the loan, and this will depend upon local workers and local patronage of khadi.

('72', 332, 5, 10, 607235) 434. SOME CRITICISM ANSWERED
('72', 332, 6, 11, 607264) A high educational officer who wishes to remain unknown has sent me, through a common friend, an elaborate and considered criticism of my plan of primary education.
('72', 332, 6, 12, 607429) For want of space I may not reproduce the whole argument here.
('72', 332, 6, 13, 607492) Nor is there anything new in it.
('72', 332, 6, 14, 607525) And yet it deserves a reply, if only for the pains the writer has bestowed on his paper.
('72', 332, 6, 15, 607614) This is how my suggestions have been paraphrased by the writer:
('72', 332, 7, 16, 607678) (i) Primary education should start and end with training in crafts and industries, and that whatever may be necessary by way of general information should come in as auxiliaries in the initial stage, and that formal training through the medium of reading and writing in subjects like History, Geography and Arithmetic [should] come right at the end.

('72', 333, 0, 1, 608072) 334 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 333, 1, 2, 608114) (ii) Primary education should be self supporting from the first, and that this should and could be achieved by the State taking over the finished articles coming from the schools and selling them to the public.
('72', 333, 2, 3, 608325) (iii) Primary education should be fully up to the Matriculation standard— less of course English.
('72', 333, 3, 4, 608423) (iv) Prof.
('72', 333, 3, 5, 608434) K. T. Shah’s idea of conscripting young men and women to teach in the primary schools should be fully examined and, if possible, acted upon.
('72', 333, 4, 6, 608575) The writer at once proceeds to say:
('72', 333, 5, 7, 608611) If we analyse the above programme it seems to us that the underlying ideas are in some cases mediaeval, and in some cases based upon assumptions which would not bear examination.
('72', 333, 5, 8, 608790) Probably No.
('72', 333, 5, 9, 608803) iii is a very high standard.
('72', 333, 5, 10, 608832) It would have been better if, instead of paraphrasing, the writer had quoted my own words.
('72', 333, 5, 11, 608923) For all the statements in the first paraphrase are wide of the truth.
('72', 333, 5, 12, 608993) My point is not that the start should be made with crafts and the rest should come in as auxiliaries.
('72', 333, 5, 13, 609095) On the contrary I have said that the whole of the general education should come through the crafts and simultaneously with their progress.
('72', 333, 5, 14, 609234) This is wholly different from what the writer imputes to me.
('72', 333, 5, 15, 609295) 1 do not know what happened in the Middle Ages.
('72', 333, 5, 16, 609343) But I do know that the aim in the Middle Ages or any age was never to develop the whole man through crafts.
('72', 333, 5, 17, 609451) The idea is original.
('72', 333, 5, 18, 609473) That it may prove to be wrong does not affect the originality.
('72', 333, 5, 19, 609536) And an original idea does not admit of a frontal attack unless it is tried on a sufficiently large scale.
('72', 333, 5, 20, 609642) To say a priori that it is impossible is no argument.
('72', 333, 5, 21, 609696) Nor have I said that the formal training through the medium of reading and writing should come right at the end.
('72', 333, 5, 22, 609809) On the contrary the formal training comes in at the very beginning.
('72', 333, 5, 23, 609877) Indeed it is an integral part of the general equipment.
('72', 333, 5, 24, 609933) I have indeed said, and I repeat here, that reading may come a little later, and writing may come last.
('72', 333, 5, 25, 610037) But the whole process has to be finished within the first year, so that at the end of the first year in the school of my imagination a seven year old child, boy or girl, will have much more than the general information that any boy or girl has in the present primary school during the first year.
('72', 333, 5, 26, 610334) He will read correctly and draw correct letters instead of making the daubs that the children generally do at present.
('72', 333, 5, 27, 610453) The child will also know elementary additions and subtractions and the simple
('72', 333, 6, 28, 610531) 1 K. T. Shah’s article appeared in Harijan, 31 7 1937.
('72', 334, 0, 1, 610586) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 335
('72', 334, 1, 2, 610630) multiplication table.
('72', 334, 1, 3, 610652) He will have learned all this through and while he has learned a productive craft, say spinning, by choice.
('72', 334, 1, 4, 610760) The second paraphrase is just as unhappy as the first.
('72', 334, 1, 5, 610815) For what I have claimed is that education through handicrafts should be self supporting during the sum total of seven years I have assigned for it.
('72', 334, 1, 6, 610963) I have specifically said that during the first two years it may mean a partial loss.
('72', 334, 1, 7, 611048) Mediaeval times may have been bad, but I am not prepared to condemn things simply because they are mediaeval.
('72', 334, 1, 8, 611158) The spinning wheel is undoubtedly mediaeval, but seems to have come to stay.
('72', 334, 1, 9, 611235) Though the article is the same it has become a symbol of freedom and unity as at one time, after the advent of the East India Company, it had become the symbol of slavery.
('72', 334, 1, 10, 611407) Modern India has found in it a deeper and truer meaning than our forefathers had dreamt of.
('72', 334, 1, 11, 611499) Even so, if the handicrafts were once symbols of factory labour, may they now be symbols and vehicles of education in the fullest and truest sense of the term.
('72', 334, 1, 12, 611659) If the Ministers have enough imagination and courage, they will give the idea a trial in spite of the criticism, undoubtedly well meant, of high educational officers and others especially when the criticism is based on imaginary premises.
('72', 334, 1, 13, 611898) Though the writer has been good enough to assume the possibility of Prof.
('72', 334, 1, 14, 611972) K. T. Shah’s scheme of conscription being sound, he later on evidently repents of it.
('72', 334, 1, 15, 612058) For he says:
('72', 334, 2, 16, 612071) The idea of conscripting teachers is to our mind an outrage.
('72', 334, 2, 17, 612132) We should have in schools, where young children assemble, men and women who have voluntarily dedicated their lives to this profession so far as such a dedication is possible in this world, and who will bring sun shine and zeal.
('72', 334, 2, 18, 612360) We have made far too many experiments with our young men and women, but this one bids fair in its results to land us in a ruin from which there will be no escape for at least half a century.
('72', 334, 2, 19, 612551) The whole thing is based on the notion that teaching is one of those arts for which no adequate training is necessary and that everyone is a born teacher.
('72', 334, 2, 20, 612706) How a man of K. T. Shah’s eminence comes to hold it is inexplicable.
('72', 334, 2, 21, 612775) The idea is a freak idea bound to be tragic in results if applied.
('72', 334, 2, 22, 612842) Again, bow can each and everyone train children in handicrafts, etc.?
('72', 334, 2, 23, 612912) Shah is well able to defend his proposition.
('72', 334, 2, 24, 612957) But I would like to remind the writer that the existing teachers are not volunteers.
('72', 334, 2, 25, 613042) They are hirelings (the word is used in its natural sense) working for their bread and butter.
('72', 334, 2, 26, 613137) Shah’s scheme does contemplate possession of patriotism, spirit of sacrifice, a certain amount of culture, and training in a handicraft, before they are taken up.
('72', 334, 2, 27, 613300) His idea is
('72', 335, 0, 1, 613312) 336 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 335, 1, 2, 613354) substantial, quite feasible, and deserves the greatest consideration.
('72', 335, 1, 3, 613424) If we have to wait till we have born teachers, we shall have to wait till the Judgement Day for them.
('72', 335, 1, 4, 613526) I submit that teachers will have to be trained on a wholesale scale during the shortest term possible.
('72', 335, 1, 5, 613629) This cannot be done unless the services of the existing educated young men and women are gently impressed.
('72', 335, 1, 6, 613736) It will not be unless there is a general willing response from that body.
('72', 335, 1, 7, 613810) They responded, however feebly, during the civil disobedience campaign.
('72', 335, 1, 8, 613882) Will they fail to respond to the call for constructive service against maintenance money?
('72', 335, 1, 9, 613972) Then the writer asks:
('72', 335, 2, 10, 613994) (1) Are we not to allow for a great deal of wastage in raw materials when handled by little boys?
('72', 335, 3, 11, 614092) (2) Are the sales to be effected by a central organization?
('72', 335, 3, 12, 614152) What about the cost of this?
('72', 335, 4, 13, 614181) (3) Are the people to be compelled to buy at these stores?
('72', 335, 5, 14, 614240) (4) What about the cases of those communities which are at present manufacturing these?
('72', 335, 5, 15, 614328) What will be the reaction on these?
('72', 335, 5, 16, 614364) My answers are: 1. Of course there will be wastage, but there will be even at the end of the first year some gain by each pupil.
('72', 335, 5, 17, 614493) 2. The State will absorb much of the material for its own requirements.
('72', 335, 5, 18, 614565) 3. Nobody will be compelled to buy the nation’s children’s manufactures, but the nation is expected to buy with pardonable pride and patriotic pleasure what its children make for its needs.
('72', 335, 5, 19, 614755) 4. There is hardly any competition in the products of village handicrafts.
('72', 335, 5, 20, 614830) And care will be taken to manufacture things which do not come into unfair competition with any indigenous manufacturers.
('72', 335, 5, 21, 614952) Thus khadi, village paper, palm gur and the like have no competitors.

('72', 336, 2, 3, 615117) Mr. J. G. Gilson is the Secretary of the Christian High and Technical School, Balasore, and Director of Industrial Arts and Vocational Education for A. B. B. O. Mission.
('72', 336, 2, 4, 615287) In sending some valuable literature on ‘Rural Sewage Disposal and the Natural Sewage Treatment Process’, he writes: 1
('72', 336, 3, 5, 615405) In general I find myself very much in agreement with your conclusions.
('72', 336, 3, 6, 615476) I was especially pleased with your clear exposition of the fact that manual work, properly conducted, is the best means to intellectual development.
('72', 336, 3, 7, 615625) I have found it hard to make teachers believe that anything else than textbooks and lectures and cramming for examination can contribute to this end.
('72', 336, 3, 8, 615775) Your explanation of the point should help to make it clear to everyone.
('72', 336, 3, 9, 615847) I was also pleased to note that you have appreciated the work done by a number of Mission schools in introducing the handwork curriculum in India.
('72', 336, 4, 10, 615994) On the other hand I cannot agree with you that education can, or should, be made self supporting by the work of the students.
('72', 336, 4, 11, 616120) If children are kept at such work for 4 hours per day under competent supervision, they can no doubt pay for their keep and perhaps for the supervision as well.
('72', 336, 4, 12, 616281) But such work has no educational value.
('72', 336, 4, 13, 616321) It may even become as dulling to the intellect as poring over textbooks and listening to lectures.
('72', 336, 5, 14, 616420) In order for the children’s work to have educational value they must be given a variety of work to do, and as soon as they have learned one operation well they must be allowed to go on to something new.
('72', 336, 5, 15, 616623) But the product of their work will not likely be sufficient to support the school.
('72', 336, 5, 16, 616706) It may contribute something toward the costs of the school.
('72', 336, 6, 17, 616766) But I see no reason why schools should be expected to be self supporting.
('72', 336, 6, 18, 616840) The education of the children, and continued education of adults, is a responsibility of the community, and it seems to me that in the present condition of India it should be the first and largest claim upon the public funds.
('72', 336, 7, 19, 617066) It is very unfortunate that prohibition and education should have been linked together in the discussions, and that the American experience with prohibition should have been brought into it in a way which shows a lack of understanding of American conditions.
('72', 336, 7, 20, 617325) If the American example is to be

('72', 337, 0, 1, 617395) 338 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 337, 1, 2, 617437) quoted let it be said that in America during the prohibition period there was no shortage of funds for education; indeed the schools were very rapidly improved during the period.
('72', 337, 2, 3, 617616) Prohibition in America was not a failure in accomplishing an improvement in the condition of the common people, with the possible exception of the big cities where the majority of the people are European born and where public opinion would not allow the enforcement of the law.
('72', 337, 2, 4, 617894) The great mass of the American people outside the cities are total abstainers and drinking is looked upon as a social and moral disgrace just as it is in India; or at least it was so until 1933. Already a strong reaction has set in against the excesses of these past four years.
('72', 337, 3, 5, 618173) Prohibition failed politically in America because of the political power of the big cities, and because the brewers and others who stood to gain by the sale of liquor were willing to spend millions of dollars in newspaper propaganda, while the mass of the people were quite indifferent to what had ceased to be, for them, a pressing problem.
('72', 337, 3, 6, 618515) It is the case of the exploitation of the country by the wealthy of the cities.
('72', 337, 3, 7, 618595) The same problem you have to face in making prohibition a success in India.
('72', 337, 3, 8, 618671) I do not wonder at Mr. Gilson’s scepticism about education through an industry being made wholly self supporting, if it is at the same time to develop the mind of the pupil.
('72', 337, 3, 9, 618845) This point is dealt with by me in another column 1. His testimony about American prohibition will be read with interest.

('72', 337, 4, 11, 618986) 436. IN SUPPORT
('72', 337, 5, 12, 619002) I completely agree with, nay, even humbly plead for your suggestion of teaching a child a useful handicraft scientifically and culturally and enabling it to produce from the moment it begins its training.
('72', 337, 5, 13, 619207) No doubt it is a revolutionary proposal, but I agree with it completely.
('72', 337, 5, 14, 619280) Its moral, cultural and economic value will be immense to the individual and to the nation.
('72', 337, 5, 15, 619372) Not only will it promote dignity of labour, but self reliance and proper creative values of life.
('72', 337, 5, 16, 619470) Our aim should be to promote a child’s intellectual, physical, moral and vocational needs.
('72', 337, 5, 17, 619561) The last will teach the general principles of all the processes of production and at the same time give the child or youth practical training in the use of the simplest tools of all industries.
('72', 337, 5, 18, 619755) Our ideal
('72', 337, 6, 19, 619765) 1 Vide the preceding item.
('72', 338, 0, 1, 619792) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 339
('72', 338, 1, 2, 619836) should be a combination of instruction with productive work on the part of the young generation.
('72', 338, 1, 3, 619933) This means a linking up of manual work with general instruction, and aims at giving a broad idea of the chief branches of industry with which manual work can be co ordinated.
('72', 338, 1, 4, 620108) Physical labour combined with an intellectual and moral effort should be our educational outlook.
('72', 338, 1, 5, 620206) There should be no cleavage between brain work and manual work.
('72', 338, 2, 6, 620270) We should include in our system of primary or elementary education:
('72', 338, 3, 7, 620338) 1. Mother tongue
('72', 338, 4, 8, 620355) 2. Arithmetic
('72', 338, 5, 9, 620369) 3. Natural science
('72', 338, 6, 10, 620388) 4. Social science
('72', 338, 7, 11, 620406) 5. Geography and history
('72', 338, 8, 12, 620431) 6. Manual or polytechnical work
('72', 338, 9, 13, 620463) 7. Physical culture
('72', 338, 10, 14, 620483) 8. Art and music
('72', 338, 11, 15, 620500) 9. Hindustani
('72', 338, 12, 16, 620514) The only question which, however, arises here is at what age a child’s education should begin.
('72', 338, 12, 17, 620609) If it be at 5 or 6, can it be possible to start a useful handicraft at that age?
('72', 338, 12, 18, 620690) What about the expenses in teaching it?
('72', 338, 12, 19, 620730) It will not be easier and less expensive than spreading literacy.
('72', 338, 12, 20, 620796) I would start a handicraft at the age of 8 or 10, because the use of implements requires a grasp and a steadiness in handling and applying them to the object in view.
('72', 338, 12, 21, 620963) But primary education must at least begin at the age of five or six.
('72', 338, 12, 22, 621032) A child cannot be made to wait longer.
('72', 338, 12, 23, 621071) We must have a ten years’ curricula to take the child to the matriculation standard in addition to the polytechnical training we intend to give it.
('72', 338, 12, 24, 621219) I am, however, doubtful about the economic value of the products of these children especially in their early stages.
('72', 338, 12, 25, 621336) They will not be saleable in a country where free trade and advanced fashions prevail and when the products themselves will not be durable or finished ones.
('72', 338, 12, 26, 621493) If the State were to purchase them or take them in return for the service or aid rendered, what will it do with them?
('72', 338, 12, 27, 621611) It would be better for the State to spend money directly on the education of children than to adopt this process.
('72', 338, 12, 28, 621725) Of course the products of advanced boys, say, between 12 and 16 may be made marketable and therefore become an important item of income.
('72', 338, 13, 29, 621862) I would rather treat the problem of literacy on a different footing and face
('72', 338, 14, 30, 621939) boldly the taxation and expenditure necessary for it.
('72', 338, 15, 31, 621993) The idea of a useful handicraft can be well developed in the advanced
('72', 339, 0, 1, 622063) 340 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 339, 1, 2, 622105) stages of primary (or secondary) education.
('72', 339, 1, 3, 622149) It should be attempted to be made at least partly self supporting, and after experience gained, fully self suppor ting, if possible, on the basis of the value of its products.
('72', 339, 1, 4, 622325) Only one danger will have to be guarded against, that cultural education of the body, mind and spirit does not become subordinated completely to the economic motive and economics of the school.
('72', 339, 2, 5, 622519) I also agree with your further suggestion of primary education being made equal to the present matriculation standard less English, but plus Hindustani (I would add).
('72', 339, 2, 6, 622686) It means you include also secondary education in the system of primary education.
('72', 339, 2, 7, 622768) Your idea is a complete scheme of school education of, say, ten years.
('72', 339, 2, 8, 622839) I would add in this that it must be imparted through the mother tongue and through no other language.
('72', 339, 2, 9, 622941) This will liberate the mind of the child and create in it a living interest in the problems of knowledge and life and give it a creative turn and outlook.
('72', 339, 3, 10, 623096) I admit here that education was largely self supporting in mediaeval times, and could be made so in a general way if our social, economic and political organization and outlook were to remain mediaeval, that is, addicted to the old and narrow values of class and caste economy, society and polity.
('72', 339, 3, 11, 623394) But today in a democratic, national and socialistic conception of life which has pervaded us, it cannot become so.
('72', 339, 3, 12, 623509) The only organized power of the community with sanctions and resources behind it is the State.
('72', 339, 3, 13, 623604) Hence it has to undertake this work.
('72', 339, 3, 14, 623641) The old power groups—caste, class, guild, college, Church—have lost their power, sanction and resources, and do not exist in that larger sense of the old times.
('72', 339, 3, 15, 623802) People also have no faith in them.
('72', 339, 3, 16, 623837) All social power has shifted to the political group which is also the economic and social force even in India.
('72', 339, 3, 17, 623948) Therefore two ideologies, one mediaeval and one modern, one pluralistic and functional, and the other unitary and territorial, cannot work together.
('72', 339, 4, 18, 624097) There was no universal education in the past, no democratic unitary State, no national equalitarian outlook.
('72', 339, 5, 19, 624206) The idea of conscription for educational service is not now a novel one but is worth following.
('72', 339, 5, 20, 624302) Let the Congress and its Provincial Ministers in their official capacity appeal to the intelligentsia of the country and call upon all who have the education of the people at heart to rally to the assistance of new Governments for the spread of literacy, culture and education.
('72', 339, 5, 21, 624580) It will establish a mass contact on a new basis, and not merely on an economic and political basis.
('72', 339, 5, 22, 624680) It will also serve the higher purposes of awakening, consolidation and organization of mass power and intelligence.
('72', 339, 5, 23, 624796) When I first wrote on self supporting primary education thro

('72', 340, 1, 3, 624994) Professor S. V. Puntambekar was among the first, to send me his.
('72', 340, 1, 4, 625059) He sent me a long reasoned reply.
('72', 340, 1, 5, 625093) But for want of space I was unable to deal with it earlier.
('72', 340, 1, 6, 625153) The foregoing is the most relevant portion of his opinion.
('72', 340, 1, 7, 625212) For the sake of abridgement I have cut out portions dealing with literacy and college education.
('72', 340, 1, 8, 625309) For at the forthcoming Conference on the 22nd and 23rd instant the main discussion will centre round self supporting primary education through an industry.

('72', 341, 11, 27, 627620) made by Mr. K. F. Nariman instead of the considered judgment at which D. N. Bahadurji and I had independently arrived in the Nariman Sardar case.
('72', 341, 11, 28, 627766) It was a painful duty that I had undertaken and then at my instance and request, D. N. Bahadurji.
('72', 341, 11, 29, 627864) But for his most valuable assistance and extraordinary labour he put into the work, I might have with the present state of my health broken down under the

('72', 342, 1, 2, 628098) burden.
('72', 342, 1, 3, 628106) The evidence that was produced before me was voluminous.
('72', 342, 1, 4, 628163) I have read every line of it but Bahadurji to whom I transferred all the papers not only read every line of the bulky papers but took elaborate notes, read the law about the intricate case of the election of 1934 and prepared the said judgment wholly independently of me.
('72', 342, 1, 5, 628435) It occupies 14 foolscap sheets of close and condensed marshalling of facts and reasoning.
('72', 342, 1, 6, 628525) He was good enough to come down to Segaon with that judgment and pass the whole of Thursday with me.
('72', 342, 1, 7, 628626) I then wrote a concurring note.
('72', 342, 1, 8, 628658) 1 I had hoped that Mr. K. F. Nariman would be with us on that day but he was unable to come.
('72', 342, 1, 9, 628751) I then suggested that on his return to Bombay, Bahadurji should send for Mr. Nariman to show him his judgment and my concurring note and that if on reading them Mr. K. F. Nariman could out of conviction accept both the judgment and my note and himself make a public statement, we should simply be satisfied with giving copies of our judgment to the parties but withhold it from the public and let Mr. Nariman’s statement take its place.
('72', 342, 1, 10, 629188) My suggestion commended itself to Bahadurji.
('72', 342, 1, 11, 629233) On Thursday night, I sent Mr. Mahadev Desai to Bombay with my notes to meet Bahadurji and Mr. Nariman.
('72', 342, 1, 12, 629336) Mr. Nariman with his counsel went to Bahadurji’s office and read our judgment and I am exceedingly happy to be able to place his statement before the public in the full hope that they and the Press will forget the past bitter and unseemly controversy that had robbed the public activity in Bombay of its usual zest and joy.
('72', 342, 1, 13, 629660) I congratulate Mr. Nariman upon his thoughtful and wholehearted confession.
('72', 342, 1, 14, 629736) I owe a debt of deep gratitude to Bahadurji for his having shared labours with me from a high sense of public duty and his unvaried affection for me.

('72', 342, 4, 17, 629949) Government means the Congress Governments in the seven Provinces.
('72', 342, 4, 18, 630015) But just because the Congress has formed Governments, there is no reason to believe that the attitude of the Congress minded people would suddenly change.
('72', 342, 4, 19, 630170) Even though the constructive programme of the Congress has gone on since the great change in 1920 it cannot be said that a lively interest has been created among

('72', 343, 0, 1, 630380) 344 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 343, 1, 2, 630422) Congressmen in this matter.
('72', 343, 1, 3, 630450) What then can we say about those who are outside the Congress?
('72', 343, 1, 4, 630513) Even though the constructive programme has not been as popular as the destructive (if one may without impropriety use the adjective “destructive” for a non violent programme) or negative programme, the Congress has kept it up since 1920. The Congress never dropped that programme and quite a few Congressmen have adopted it.
('72', 343, 1, 5, 630838) Hence, whatever could be achieved in this field has been achieved only by Congressmen, and progress too can be expected only where Congress Governments have been formed.
('72', 343, 1, 6, 631008) But just because the Congress has taken up office, those who have faith in the constructive programme should not slaken their efforts.
('72', 343, 1, 7, 631143) Nor should they become complacent.
('72', 343, 1, 8, 631178) Now that the Congress has formed Governments, their duty is to be more alert, more industrious, more studious.
('72', 343, 1, 9, 631289) Only if this happens can the hopes entertained of the Congress Governments be fulfilled.
('72', 343, 1, 10, 631378) Congress Government means a democratic government responsible to the people.
('72', 343, 1, 11, 631455) If the people want, they can throw out such a government.
('72', 343, 1, 12, 631513) It is based on the will and authority of the people.
('72', 343, 1, 13, 631566) Hence, if Congressmen are keen, they can, and unless they are keen they cannot, get the constructive programme accepted and implemented.
('72', 343, 1, 14, 631703) The Government has no independent power, i.
('72', 343, 1, 15, 631747) e., no physical force.
('72', 343, 1, 16, 631770) The Congress has voluntarily given up that power.
('72', 343, 1, 17, 631820) The British Government wields that power.
('72', 343, 1, 18, 631862) When the Congress Government has to resort to the use of the British power, that is, physical force, it should be regarded as the lowering of the tricolour.
('72', 343, 1, 19, 632019) It should be regarded that, from that day the Congress Government has ceased to be.
('72', 343, 1, 20, 632103) But if the people do not follow the Congress, that is, the Congress Governments, or if non violence has not entered their hearts, the Government which today appears glorious will lose its glory tomorrow.
('72', 343, 1, 21, 632307) And so, Congressmen who have faith in the constructive programme should wake up.
('72', 343, 1, 22, 632388) The scheme of education that I have presented is also a substantial part of the constructive programme.
('72', 343, 1, 23, 632492) It is not my intention to suggest that the Congress has adopted the form I am giving it now.
('72', 343, 1, 24, 632585) But I am firmly convinced that what I am writing now was implicit in everything I have said or written since 1920 about national schools, and now that the occasion has arisen, it has found prompt expression.
('72', 343, 1, 25, 632793) Now, if primary education is to be imparted through a craft, that task can be carried out for the present only by the people who have faith in the spinning wheel and other village industries.
('72', 343, 1, 26, 632985) For, on the
('72', 344, 0, 1, 632997) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 345
('72', 344, 1, 2, 633041) subject of the charkha, which occupies a central position in cottage industries, the Spinners’ Association has collected considerable information and on other industries the Village Industries Association has been collecting it.
('72', 344, 1, 3, 633270) Hence, in my view, whatever immediate provisions we can make can only be through the charkha and allied crafts.
('72', 344, 1, 4, 633382) But all those who have faith in the charkha are not teachers.
('72', 344, 1, 5, 633444) Every carpenter is no authority on carpentry.
('72', 344, 1, 6, 633490) One who has no knowledge of the science of the craft cannot impart general education through the craft.
('72', 344, 1, 7, 633594) And so, only those who are interested in the science of education and have faith in the charkha, etc., can introduce the scheme of primary education which I have suggested.
('72', 344, 1, 8, 633767) I am reproducing the letter 1 from Shri Dilkhush Diwanji with the idea that it would be useful to such persons.

('72', 344, 3, 11, 633971) I had known Manilal Kothari even before the Harijan campaign gathered momentum.
('72', 344, 3, 12, 634051) And from the day I came to know him I had never once noticed in him the faintest trace of a feeling of untouchability.
('72', 344, 3, 13, 634170) He was always prepared to face the risks that are inevitable while trying to help Harijans.
('72', 344, 3, 14, 634262) He had a flair almost unique for collecting funds for noble causes.
('72', 344, 3, 15, 634330) This is no exaggeration.
('72', 344, 3, 16, 634355) He had many capacities; but he will always be remembered for his ability to collect money for benevolent causes.
('72', 344, 3, 17, 634468) He had collected large funds for Harijan work, and had offered to collect as much money as I wanted if he recovered.
('72', 344, 3, 18, 634585) He used to receive requests from all quarters for collecting money.
('72', 344, 3, 19, 634653) Manilal was a very sensitive man.
('72', 344, 3, 20, 634687) Any altruistic work would interest him.
('72', 344, 3, 21, 634727) His eagerness to serve made him plunge into any kind of danger.
('72', 344, 3, 22, 634791) His death will no doubt be a great loss to his family, and also to Harijans.
('72', 344, 3, 23, 634868) In many other spheres of service as well his absence will be felt for a long time.
('72', 344, 3, 24, 634951) May God grant peace to his soul.

('72', 345, 3, 4, 635372) DEAR FRIEND, I am glad you are liberally taking passages from C. F. Andrews’s pen in your anthology of devotional literature.
('72', 345, 3, 5, 635498) For Charlie Andrews is a man of prayer and deep faith.
('72', 345, 3, 6, 635553) He is a Christian to the marrow, but his Christ is not the Jesus Christ of a narrow sect.
('72', 345, 3, 7, 635643) His Christ is the Anointed of humanity.
('72', 345, 3, 8, 635683) He sees Him in Ramakrishna, Chaitanya and many other teachers whom I can name, and who are of other faiths.
('72', 345, 3, 9, 635791) We in India, who know him, call him Deenabandhu, friend of the afflicted.
('72', 345, 3, 10, 635865) Our friendship is of long standing; we are like blood brothers.
('72', 345, 3, 11, 635929) There are no secrets between us.
('72', 345, 3, 12, 635962) Charlie is as simple as a child, forgiving and generous to a fault.
('72', 345, 3, 13, 636030) He is loving and lovable like a woman who is purity personified.
('72', 345, 3, 14, 636095) In jest I call him half woman and half man—but I mean it.

('72', 345, 8, 22, 636413) I am sure to return on the 1st or 2nd.
('72', 345, 8, 23, 636452) I shall not be going to the Frontier without returning to Segaon first.
('72', 345, 8, 24, 636524) You have to regain here the weight you have lost.
('72', 345, 8, 25, 636574) Obtain Jayaprakash’s permission—for staying here.
('72', 345, 8, 26, 636624) The cold has started here.
('72', 345, 8, 27, 636651) Bring enough covering for the night, otherwise your blanket which is with me will go back to you.
('72', 345, 8, 28, 636749) But it is a good deal worn out now.
('72', 345, 8, 29, 636785) Chimanlal is all right now, though he is still in bed.

('72', 346, 6, 10, 637142) MATHURADAS, I cannot swallow what you say in your letter.
('72', 346, 6, 11, 637200) My conception of Swadeshi is not what you take it to be.
('72', 346, 6, 12, 637257) I have no hand in bringing in Jairamdas.
('72', 346, 6, 13, 637298) But I was not shocked at the mention of his name.
('72', 346, 6, 14, 637348) They wanted someone from the Working Committee.
('72', 346, 6, 15, 637396) And this is something for which it is good to have an outsider.
('72', 346, 6, 16, 637460) The same thing had to be done at Kanpur.
('72', 346, 6, 17, 637501) Our groups are not meant to suffocate us.
('72', 346, 6, 18, 637543) They must be nurtured and in turn they must nurture others.
('72', 346, 6, 19, 637603) What should Utkal, Assam or the Frontier Province do?
('72', 346, 6, 20, 637657) I should be held responsible for Brelvi.
('72', 346, 6, 21, 637698) I had insisted on having him.
('72', 346, 6, 22, 637728) I know his limitations.
('72', 346, 6, 23, 637752) Who amongst us is without limitations?
('72', 346, 6, 24, 637791) There should be definitely one Muslim member on such a Committee.
('72', 346, 6, 25, 637857) And I could find none better than Brelvi.
('72', 346, 6, 26, 637899) About the exhibition, I shall reply in Harijan.
('72', 346, 6, 27, 637947) That will make things easy for you.
('72', 346, 6, 28, 637983) Besides, that problem has become rather compli cated.
('72', 346, 6, 29, 638037) Do come on 22nd and 23rd if you can make it.
('72', 346, 6, 30, 638082) I have asked them to send you an invitation.
('72', 346, 6, 31, 638127) But you can consider this letter itself an invitation.

('72', 347, 2, 3, 638419) WARDHA, October 17, 1937 Andamans prisoners may not be forgotten.
('72', 347, 2, 4, 638485) To remind me that I have made promise to them that I would strain every nerve to secure their release, I have received three letters from three provinces telling me that treatment of prisoners who have been brought from the Andamans is worse than there, that there seems to be no prospect of their early release and that if no release was forthcoming they might have to fall back upon the only weapon open to them, that is, hunger strike.
('72', 347, 2, 5, 638924) I hope that they will not resort to hunger strike so long as they know that the public is not supine about their welfare.
('72', 347, 2, 6, 639046) For myself I may assure them that I am not sleeping over the matter.
('72', 347, 2, 7, 639115) And I urge the public and the Press to keep a vigilant eye on this urgent matter.
('72', 347, 2, 8, 639197) I would appeal to Provincial Governments which have received these prisoners to accord to them the treatment which the country expects them to give.
('72', 347, 2, 9, 639346) Provincial Governments which are in such matters now responsible to the people may not disregard the popular wish.
('72', 347, 2, 10, 639461) I expect that in this there is no difference between the Congress and other organizations.

('72', 347, 5, 14, 639644) MY DEAR UNTOUCHABLE, Some people have the patience to wait for titles till they come to them.
('72', 347, 5, 15, 639738) You have no patience and therefore your titles are generally well chosen.
('72', 347, 5, 16, 639812) Only the first was ill chosen.
('72', 347, 5, 17, 639843) Who will call you a rebel?
('72', 347, 5, 18, 639870) Not I. Idiot, of course.
('72', 347, 5, 19, 639895) But I forget.
('72', 347, 5, 20, 639909) That was a title given to you.
('72', 347, 5, 21, 639940) You willingly accepted it.
('72', 347, 5, 22, 639967) Untouchable you are, as all of the princely blood are.
('72', 347, 5, 23, 640022) I wonder what will be the next choice.
('72', 347, 5, 24, 640061) Today I am taking it easy.
('72', 347, 5, 25, 640088) Instead of writing much, I am sleeping.
('72', 347, 5, 26, 640128) The article I wrote last night.

('72', 348, 6, 14, 640704) MY DEAR IDIOT, This is the second letter I am writing to you today.
('72', 348, 6, 15, 640772) This is to congratulate you on your progress in Hindi of which your Hindi letter is ample evidence.
('72', 348, 6, 16, 640872) You will presently have a chaste style too.
('72', 348, 6, 17, 640916) You must read Ramayana regularly and perhaps a Hindi newspaper.
('72', 348, 6, 18, 640980) Never mind the newspaper however.
('72', 348, 6, 19, 641014) What Shakespeare is to English, Tulsidas is to Hindi.
('72', 348, 6, 20, 641068) Therefore I should be satisfied if you read Tulsidas only.
('72', 348, 6, 21, 641127) Of course a good grammar is a necessity.
('72', 348, 6, 22, 641168) Yes, do not resist Shummy and stay there as long as he wants you to and keeps happy himself.
('72', 348, 6, 23, 641261) You would have more quiet too for your address 1 which should be original, terse and to the point.
('72', 348, 6, 24, 641360) You must not be discursive.
('72', 348, 6, 25, 641388) Do not take much time over the past work.
('72', 348, 6, 26, 641430) But devote yourself to the future programme—bold, universal and constructive.
('72', 348, 6, 27, 641508) Above all it must be practical and in terms of the villages and yet such as your members can reach.
('72', 348, 6, 28, 641608) They won’t work in the villages, they can for the villages.

('72', 352, 3, 4, 645469) DEAR FRIEND, I carefully went through your speech at Lucknow 1, and I felt deeply hurt over your misunderstanding of my attitude.
('72', 352, 3, 5, 645599) My letter 2 was in answer to a specially private message you had sent to me.
('72', 352, 3, 6, 645676) It represented my deepest feeling.
('72', 352, 3, 7, 645711) The letter was purely personal.
('72', 352, 3, 8, 645743) Were you right in using it as you did?
('72', 352, 3, 9, 645782) Of course, as I read it, the whole of your speech is a declaration of war.
('72', 352, 3, 10, 645857) Only I had hoped you would reserve poor me as bridge between the two.
('72', 352, 3, 11, 645927) I see that you want no bridge.
('72', 352, 3, 12, 645958) I am sorry.
('72', 352, 3, 13, 645970) Only it takes two to make a quarrel.

('72', 353, 10, 15, 647653) Amritlal has no visible symptoms of any disease.
('72', 353, 10, 16, 647702) He works and gets no fever at all.
('72', 353, 10, 17, 647737) But he does not put on weight.
('72', 353, 10, 18, 647768) He takes enough of ghee and milk.
('72', 353, 10, 19, 647802) He has lost a little weight since coming here, but has more energy.
('72', 353, 10, 20, 647870) There is of course no reason for worry.
('72', 353, 10, 21, 647910) I have often suggested to him that he should go there but he does not feel inclined at all.
('72', 353, 10, 22, 648002) I, therefore, do not force him.
('72', 353, 10, 23, 648034) Thus what Amritlal wrote to you was not incorrect in any way.
('72', 353, 10, 24, 648096) I do feel, however, that he did not give you all the facts.
('72', 353, 10, 25, 648156) He should have informed you about his weight, etc.
('72', 353, 10, 26, 648207) There is no point in concealing such things.
('72', 353, 10, 27, 648252) Of course, if one has a slight headache one needn’t write about it.
('72', 353, 10, 28, 648320) And you don’t expect it, either.
('72', 353, 10, 29, 648353) Having said all this, I adviseyou not to worry.
('72', 353, 10, 30, 648401) There is absolutely no need.
('72', 353, 10, 31, 648430) Let him follow his own inclination.

('72', 354, 1, 3, 648619) WILLIAM H. TANDY
('72', 354, 2, 4, 648636) SEGAON, WARDHA, October 20, 1937
('72', 354, 3, 5, 648669) DEAR DOCTOR TANDY, With reference to your hospital scheme, which you were good enough to explain to me today, you tell me that you propose to add family quarters for your patients’ families who would desire to supply the patients with food prepared by them.
('72', 354, 3, 6, 648927) My experience, in what little hospital work I have done, has shown me that it is a harmful concession to prejudice.
('72', 354, 3, 7, 649043) For the food cooked by private parties is rarely cooked according to directions.
('72', 354, 3, 8, 649124) Doting relatives disregard restrictions, pamper patients, and retard recovery where their false affection does not prove fatal to the patients.
('72', 354, 3, 9, 649268) I would, therefore, strongly advise you, for the sake of the patients themselves, not to encourage private cooking for patients under your care, even as you would not allow relatives to administer to them drugs of their own choice.
('72', 354, 3, 10, 649500) If the patients bring families, they can see the former only at stated times and under proper restrictions.
('72', 354, 3, 11, 649608) I know that there are, unfortunately, so called higher castes, who observe untouchability as to food.
('72', 354, 3, 12, 649710) In my opinion you cannot afford to pander to such prejudice, especially at a time when untouchability is fast dying.
('72', 354, 3, 13, 649827) What I hope you will do is to run a strictly vegetarian kitchen for those who would not on any account take flesh, meat or fish.
('72', 354, 4, 14, 649956) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI

('72', 357, 10, 23, 653699) October 22, 1937
('72', 357, 11, 24, 653716) Gandhiji, after thanking all those who had come in response to the invitations, said whether he was there as Chairman or member, he had invited them in order to listen to their opinion and advice on the propositions 2 he had formulated, especially of those who were opposed to them.
('72', 357, 11, 25, 653999) He asked for a free, frank and full discussion, as he regretted his inability to meet the friends outside of the pandal for reasons of health.
('72', 357, 12, 26, 654142) The propositions, he said, referred both to primary education and college
('72', 357, 13, 27, 654216) 1 This and the following item are reproduced from Mahadev Desai’s article “The Primary Question”.
('72', 357, 13, 28, 654314) The Conference was held on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee of Marwari Shiksha Mandal under the presidentship of Gandhiji.
('72', 357, 13, 29, 654439) The morning session was held from 8.30 a.m.
('72', 357, 13, 30, 654483) to 11.30 a.m.

('72', 358, 1, 2, 654591) education, but they would largely have to address themselves to a consideration of primary education.
('72', 358, 1, 3, 654693) He had included secondary in primary education because primary education was the only education so called that was available to a very small fraction of the people in our villages, many of which he had seen during his peregrinations since 1915. He was speaking exclusively about the needs of these rural boys and girls, the bulk of whom were illiterate.
('72', 358, 1, 4, 655047) He had no experience of college education, though he had come in contact with hundreds of college boys, had heart to heart chats and correspondence with them, knew their needs, failings and the disease they suffered from.
('72', 358, 1, 5, 655269) But they might restrict themselves to a consideration of primary education.
('72', 358, 1, 6, 655345) For, the moment that primary question was solved the secondary one of college education would also be solved.
('72', 358, 2, 7, 655455) He was deliberately of opinion that the present system of primary education was not only wasteful but harmful.
('72', 358, 2, 8, 655566) Most of the boys were lost to the parents and to the occupation to which they were born.
('72', 358, 2, 9, 655655) They picked up evil habits, affected urban ways, and got a smattering of something which may be anything else but not education.
('72', 358, 2, 10, 655784) The remedy, he thought, lay in educating them by means of vocational or manual training.
('72', 358, 2, 11, 655873) He had some experience of it having trained his own sons and the children on the Tolstoy Farm in South Africa 1, belonging to all castes and creeds, who were good, bad and indifferent, through some manual training, e.
('72', 358, 2, 12, 656091) g., carpentry or shoe making which he had learnt from Kallenbach who had training in a Trappist monastery.
('72', 358, 2, 13, 656198) His sons and all these children, he was confident, had lost nothing, though he could not give them an education that either satisfied himself or them, as the time at his disposal was limited and his preoccupations numerous.
('72', 358, 3, 14, 656422) The core of his emphasis was not the occupations but education through manual training—all education, of letters, history, geography, mathematics, science, etc., through manual training.
('72', 358, 3, 15, 656609) It might be objected that in the Middle Ages nothing else was taught.
('72', 358, 3, 16, 656679) But the occupational training then was far from serving an educational purpose.
('72', 358, 3, 17, 656759) In this age those born to certain professions had forgotten them, taken to clerical careers, and were lost to the countryside.
('72', 358, 3, 18, 656886) As a result, go wherever we might, it was impossible to find an efficient carpenter or a smith in an average village.
('72', 358, 3, 19, 657004) The handicrafts were nearly lost, and the spinning wheel being neglected was taken to Lancashire where it was developed, thanks to the English genius for developing crafts, to an extent that was to be seen today This he said irrespective of his views on industrialism.
('72', 358, 4, 20, 657273) The remedy lay in imparting the whole art and science of a craft through practical training and therethrough imparting education.
('72', 358, 4, 21, 657403) Teaching of takli spinning, for instance, presupposed imparting of knowledge of various varieties of cotton,

('72', 359, 1, 2, 657608) different soils in different provinces of India, the history of the ruin of the handicraft, its political reasons which would include the history of the British rule in India, knowledge of arithmetic, and so on.
('72', 359, 1, 3, 657820) He was trying the experiment on his little grandson 1 who scarcely felt that he was being taught, for he all the while played and laughed and sang.
('72', 359, 2, 4, 657968) He was specially mentioning the takli in order that they might put to him questions about it, and as he had much to do with it, and seen its power and its romance; also because the handicraft of making cloth was the only one which could be universally taught and because the takli required no expense.
('72', 359, 2, 5, 658270) It had more than proved its worth.
('72', 359, 2, 6, 658305) The constructive programme, to the extent it had been carried out, had led to the formation of the Congress Ministries in seven provinces, and their success also would depend on the extent to which we carried it out.
('72', 359, 3, 7, 658522) He had contemplated a seven years’ course which so far as the takli was concerned would culminate in practical knowledge of weaving (including dyeing, designing, etc.).
('72', 359, 3, 8, 658691) The custom for all the cloth we could produce was there ready.
('72', 359, 4, 9, 658754) He was very keen on finding the expenses of the teacher through the product of the manual work of his pupils, as he was convinced that there was no other way to carry education to crores of our children.
('72', 359, 4, 10, 658958) We could not wait until we had the necessary revenue, until the Viceroy reduced the military expenditure, and so on.
('72', 359, 4, 11, 659075) He asked them to remember that this primary education would include the elementary principles of sanitation, hygiene, nutrition, of doing their own work, helping parents at home, etc.
('72', 359, 4, 12, 659259) The present generation of boys knew no cleanliness, no self help, and physically were C 3. He would therefore give compulsory physical training through musical drill, etc.
('72', 359, 5, 13, 659431) The speaker had been accused of being opposed to literary training.
('72', 359, 5, 14, 659499) Far from it.
('72', 359, 5, 15, 659512) He simply wanted to show the way in which it should be given.
('72', 359, 5, 16, 659574) The self supporting aspect had also been attacked.
('72', 359, 5, 17, 659625) Whereas, it was said, we should be expending millions on primary education, we were going to exploit the children.
('72', 359, 5, 18, 659740) It was also feared that there would be enormous waste.
('72', 359, 5, 19, 659795) This fear was falsified by experience.
('72', 359, 5, 20, 659834) As for exploiting or burdening the children, he would ask whether it was burdening the child to save him from a disaster.
('72', 359, 5, 21, 659956) Takli was a good enough toy to play with.
('72', 359, 5, 22, 659998) It was no less a toy because it was a productive toy.
('72', 359, 5, 23, 660052) Even today children helped their parents to a certain extent.
('72', 359, 5, 24, 660114) The Segaon children knew the details of agriculture better than he, having worked with their parents on the fields, Whilst the child would be encouraged to spin and help his parents, with agricultural jobs, he would also be made to feel that he did not belong only to his parents, but to the village and to the country and that he must make some return to them.
('72', 359, 5, 25, 660476) That was the only way.
('72', 359, 5, 26, 660499) He would tell the Ministers that they would make children helpless by doling out education to them.
('72', 359, 5, 27, 660599) They would make them self confident and brave by their paying for their own education by their own labour.

('72', 360, 1, 2, 660818) This system was to be common to all—Hindus, Mussalmans, Parsis, Christians.
('72', 360, 1, 3, 660894) Why did he not lay any stress on religious instruction, he was asked.
('72', 360, 1, 4, 660964) Because he was teaching them practical religion, the religion of self help.
('72', 360, 2, 5, 661040) The State, continued Gandhiji, was bound to find employment, if they needed it, for all the pupils thus trained.
('72', 360, 2, 6, 661153) As for teachers, Prof.
('72', 360, 2, 7, 661176) Shah had suggested the method of conscription.
('72', 360, 2, 8, 661223) 1 He had demonstrated its value by citing instances from Italy and other lands.
('72', 360, 2, 9, 661303) If Mussolini could impress the youth of Italy for the service of his country, why should not we?
('72', 360, 2, 10, 661400) Was it fair to label as slavery the compulsory enlistment of service of our youth for a year or longer before they began their career?
('72', 360, 2, 11, 661535) The youths had contributed a lot to the success of the movement for freedom during the past 17 years, and the speaker would call upon them to freely give a year of their lives to the service of the nation.
('72', 360, 2, 12, 661741) Legislation, if it was necessary in this respect, would not be compulsion, as it could not be passed without the consent of the majority of our representatives.
('72', 360, 3, 13, 661902) Gandhiji would therefore ask them to say whether this imparting of education through manual training appealed to them.
('72', 360, 3, 14, 662021) For him to make it self supporting would be a test of its efficiency.
('72', 360, 3, 15, 662091) The children ought at the end of seven years be able to pay for their instruction and be earning units.
('72', 360, 3, 16, 662195) College education was largely an urban proposition.
('72', 360, 3, 17, 662247) He would not say that it was an unmitigated failure, as primary education was, but the results were fairly disappointing.
('72', 360, 3, 18, 662369) Why should anyone of the graduates have to be unemployed?
('72', 360, 4, 19, 662427) Takli he had proposed as a concrete instance because Vinoba had the largest amount of practical experience in it, and he was there to answer their objections, if any.
('72', 360, 4, 20, 662594) Kakasaheb would also be able to tell them something, though his experience was more theoretical than practical.
('72', 360, 4, 21, 662706) He had especially drawn Gandhiji’s attention to Armstrong’s Education for Life, especially the chapter on “Education of the Hand”.
('72', 360, 4, 22, 662837) The late Madhusudan Das was a lawyer, but he was convinced that without the use of our hands and feet our brain would be atrophied, and even if it worked it would be the home of Satan.
('72', 360, 4, 23, 663022) Tolstoy had taught the same lesson through many of his tales.
('72', 360, 4, 24, 663084) Gandhiji concluded by inviting the attention of the audience to the very fundamentals of his plan of self supporting primary education: We have communal quarrels—not that they are peculiar to us.
('72', 360, 4, 25, 663280) England had also its Wars of the Roses, and today British Imperialism is the enemy of the world.
('72', 360, 4, 26, 663377) If we want to eliminate communal strife and international strife, we must start with foundations pure and strong by rearing our younger generation on the education I have adumbrated.
('72', 360, 4, 27, 663560) That plan springs out of non violence.
('72', 360, 4, 28, 663599) I suggested it in connection with the nation’s resolve to effect complete prohibition, but I may tell you that even if there was to be no loss of revenue, and our exchequer was full, this education would be a sine qua non if we did not want to urbanize our boys.
('72', 360, 4, 29, 663862) We have to make them true

('72', 361, 1, 3, 664069) We cannot do so otherwise than by giving them a course of self supporting primary education.
('72', 361, 1, 4, 664162) Europe is no example for us.
('72', 361, 1, 5, 664191) It plans its programmes in terms of violence because it believes in violence.
('72', 361, 1, 6, 664269) I would be the last to minimize the achievement of Russia, but the whole structure is based on force and violence.
('72', 361, 1, 7, 664384) If India has resolved to eschew violence, this system of education becomes an integral part of the discipline she has to go through.
('72', 361, 1, 8, 664517) We are told that England expends millions on education, America also does so but we forget that all that wealth is obtained through exploitation.
('72', 361, 1, 9, 664663) They have reduced the art of exploitation to a science and might well give their boys the costly education they do.
('72', 361, 1, 10, 664779) We cannot, will not, think in terms of exploitation, and we have no alternative but this plan of education which is based on non violence.

('72', 361, 4, 13, 664979) October 22, 1937
('72', 361, 5, 14, 664996) In the afternoon Gandhiji opened the session 2 with answering some of the criticisms.
('72', 361, 5, 15, 665082) Takli was not the only thing, but that was the only thing which could be universalized.
('72', 361, 5, 16, 665170) There was paper making, gur making from palms, and so on.
('72', 361, 5, 17, 665228) It would be the function of the Ministers to find out what handicraft would suit what school best.
('72', 361, 5, 18, 665327) He would warn those who were enamoured of the machine that there was every danger of men being turned into machines with the emphasis on the machine.
('72', 361, 5, 19, 665477) For those who wanted to live under the machine age his scheme would be useless, but he would also tell them that it would be impossible to keep villagers alive by means of machines.
('72', 361, 5, 20, 665659) Where there were 300 million living machines, it was idle to think of bringing in new dead machinery.
('72', 361, 5, 21, 665761) Dr. Zakir Husain was not right when he said that the scheme was educationally sound, irrespective of the ideological background.
('72', 361, 5, 22, 665890) 3 A lady who knew the project method was visiting Gandhiji the other day, and she said that there was a vast difference between the project method and Gandhiji’s scheme.
('72', 361, 5, 23, 666060) But he would not ask them to accept the scheme without conviction.
('72', 361, 5, 24, 666127) If our own people acted
('72', 361, 6, 25, 666151) 1 This was followed by a discussion in which Zakir Husain, Abdul Huq, Sauda mini Mehta, K. T. Shah, Tijare, Principal of Khamgaon National School, Bhagwat, Dr. Syed Mahmud, and Balubhai Thakore participated.
('72', 361, 7, 26, 666359) 2 Held from 2.30 p.m.
('72', 361, 7, 27, 666381) to 5 p.m.
('72', 361, 8, 28, 666391) 3 Zakir Husain had opened the discussion in the morning with the remarks that he welcomed the proposals as a sound educational proposition no matter whether one believed in urban civilization or rural, violence or non violence.
('72', 362, 0, 1, 666619) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 363
('72', 362, 1, 2, 666663) on the square, there would be no slaves but perfect artisans produced from these schools.
('72', 362, 1, 3, 666753) Any labour taken from the children should certainly be worth two pice an hour.
('72', 362, 2, 4, 666832) But he warned them against accepting anything out of their regard for him.
('72', 362, 2, 5, 666907) He was near death’s door and would not dream of thrusting anything down people’s throats.
('72', 362, 2, 6, 666997) The scheme must be accepted after full and mature consideration so that it may not have to be given up in a little while.
('72', 362, 2, 7, 667119) He agreed with Prof.
('72', 362, 2, 8, 667140) Shah that a State was not worth anything which could not provide for its unemployed.
('72', 362, 2, 9, 667225) But providing doles was not the solution of unemployment.
('72', 362, 2, 10, 667283) He would provide every one of them with work and give them food if not money.
('72', 362, 2, 11, 667361) God did not create us to eat, drink and be merry but to earn our bread in the sweat of our brow.

('72', 362, 4, 13, 667478) 468. CIVIL LIBERTY
('72', 362, 5, 14, 667497) Gurudev has given the poetry of Civil Liberty.
('72', 362, 5, 15, 667544) 2 It bears reproduction in a weekly journal like Harijan, although the statement has gone round the world.
('72', 362, 5, 16, 667651) The reader will find it in another column.
('72', 362, 5, 17, 667694) It is a paraphrase of “Work out thine own salvation”, 3 or “Man is his own enemy and his own friend.” Civil liberty is not criminal liberty.
('72', 362, 5, 18, 667835) When law and order are under popular control, the Ministers in charge of the Department cannot hold the portfolio for a day if they act against the popular will.
('72', 362, 5, 19, 667997) It is true that the Assemblies are not sufficiently representative of the whole people.
('72', 362, 5, 20, 668085) Nevertheless the suffrage is wide enough to make it representative of the nation in matters of law and order.
('72', 362, 5, 21, 668195) In seven provinces the Congress rules.
('72', 362, 5, 22, 668234) It seems to be assumed by some persons that, in these provinces at least, individuals can say and do what they like.
('72', 362, 5, 23, 668351) But so far as I know the Congress mind, it will not tolerate any such licence.
('72', 362, 5, 24, 668430) Civil liberty means the fullest liberty to say and do what one likes within the ordinary law of the land.
('72', 362, 5, 25, 668536) The word ‘ordinary’ has
('72', 362, 6, 26, 668560) 1 Among those who spoke after Gandhiji were: Vinoba Bhave, Dr. P. C. Ray, D. B. Kalelkar, K. T. Shah, Deva Sharma, M. S. Hussain, Nana Athayale, N. R. Malkani, Nanabhai Bhatt, B. G. Kher, Subbarayan and Biswanath Das.
('72', 362, 6, 27, 668778) After the first day’s proceedings the Conference converted itself into a committee to consider the propositions formulated by Gandhiji.
('72', 362, 7, 28, 668914) 2 A message was sent by Rabindranath Tagore to the Conference on Civil Liberty in India held in London on October 17.
('72', 362, 8, 29, 669032) 3 Bhagavad Gita, VI.
('72', 363, 0, 1, 669053) 364 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 363, 1, 2, 669095) been purposely used here.
('72', 363, 1, 3, 669121) The Penal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code, not to speak of the Special Powers Legislation, contain provisions which the foreign rulers have enacted for their own safety.
('72', 363, 1, 4, 669296) These provisions can be easily identified, and must be ruled out of operation.
('72', 363, 1, 5, 669375) The real test, however, is the interpretation by the Working Committee of the power of the Ministers of Law and Order.
('72', 363, 1, 6, 669494) Subject, therefore, to the general instructions laid down by the Working Committee for the guidance of Congress Ministers, the Statutory Powers, limited in the manner indicated by me, must be exercised by the Ministers against those who, in the name of civil liberty, preach lawlessness in the popular sense of the term.
('72', 363, 1, 7, 669815) It has been suggested that Congress Ministers who are pledged to non violence cannot resort to legal processes involving punish ments.Such is not my view of the non violence accepted by the Congress.
('72', 363, 1, 8, 670015) I have personally, not found a way out of punishments and punitive restrictions in all conceivable cases.
('72', 363, 1, 9, 670121) No doubt punishments have to be non violent, if such an expression is permissible in this connection.
('72', 363, 1, 10, 670223) Just as violence has its own technique, known by the military science, which has invented means of destruction unheard of before, non violence has its own science and technique.
('72', 363, 1, 11, 670401) Non violence in politics is a new weapon in the process of evolution.
('72', 363, 1, 12, 670471) Its vast possibilities are yet unexplored.
('72', 363, 1, 13, 670514) The exploration can take place only if it is practised on a big scale and in various fields.
('72', 363, 1, 14, 670607) Congress Ministers, if they have faith in non violence, will undertake the explorations.
('72', 363, 1, 15, 670696) But whilst they are doing this, or whether they do so or not, there is no doubt that they cannot ignore incitements to violence and manifestly violent speech, even though they may themselves run the risk of being styled violent.
('72', 363, 1, 16, 670925) When they are not wanted, the public will only have to signify its disapproval through its representatives.
('72', 363, 1, 17, 671033) In the absence of definite instructions from the Congress, it would be proper for the Ministers to report, what they consider is violent behaviour of any member of the public, to their own Provincial Congress Committee, or the Working Committee, and seek instructions.
('72', 363, 1, 18, 671302) If the superior authority does not approve of their recommendations, they may offer to resign.
('72', 363, 1, 19, 671397) They may not allow things to drift so far as to have to summon the aid of the Military.
('72', 363, 1, 20, 671485) In my opinion, it would amount to political bankruptcy when any Minister is obliged to fall back on the Military, which does not belong to the people, and which, in any scheme of non violence, must be ruled out of count for the observance of internal peace.
('72', 364, 0, 1, 671743) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 365
('72', 364, 1, 2, 671787) One interpretation I put upon the India Act is that it is an unconscious challenge to Congressmen to demonstrate the virtue of non violence and the sincerity of their conviction about it.
('72', 364, 1, 3, 671975) If the Congress can give such a demonstration, most of the safeguards fall into desuetude, and the Congress can achieve its goal without a violent struggle, and also without civil disobedience.
('72', 364, 1, 4, 672169) If the Congress has not impregnated the people with the non violent spirit, it has to become a minority, and remain in opposition, unless it will alter its creed.
('72', 364, 2, 5, 672332) Harijan, 23 10 1937
('72', 364, 3, 6, 672352) 469. INDIAN INDUSTRY
('72', 364, 4, 7, 672373) The question is often asked: What is an Indian industry?
('72', 364, 4, 8, 672430) It is asked generally regarding Indian exhibitions.
('72', 364, 4, 9, 672482) Formerly it used to be claimed that any industry that was conducted in India was an Indian industry.
('72', 364, 4, 10, 672583) Thus a mill manned by non domiciled Europeans bringing capital, skilled man power and machinery from abroad was considered to be an Indian industry even though it could be proved to be harmful to the masses.
('72', 364, 4, 11, 672791) From that we have travelled a long distance.
('72', 364, 4, 12, 672836) An industry to be Indian must be demonstrably in the interest of the masses; it must be manned by Indians both skilled and unskilled.
('72', 364, 4, 13, 672970) Its capital and machinery should be Indian and the labour employed should have a living wage and be comfortably housed, while the welfare of the children of the labourers should be guaranteed by the employers.
('72', 364, 4, 14, 673180) This is an ideal definition.
('72', 364, 4, 15, 673209) Only the A. I. S. A. and the A.I.V.I.A. can perhaps barely satisfy that definition.
('72', 364, 4, 16, 673293) For even these Associations have much leeway to make up.
('72', 364, 4, 17, 673350) Nevertheless complete conformation to the definition is their immediate goal.
('72', 364, 4, 18, 673428) But between that definition and the one that was the vogue even with the Congress before 1920 there are many shades of definitions.
('72', 364, 4, 19, 673560) The Congress definition has generally been all goods other than mill cloth manufactured in India.
('72', 364, 4, 20, 673658) The great mill industry may generally be claimed to be an Indian industry.
('72', 364, 4, 21, 673733) But, in spite of its ability to compete with Japan and Lancashire, it is an industry that exploits the masses and deepens their poverty in exact proportion to its success over khadi.
('72', 364, 4, 22, 673916) In the modern craze for wholesale industrialization, my presentation has been questioned, if not brushed aside.
('72', 364, 4, 23, 674028) It has been contended that the growing poverty of the masses, due to the progress of industrialization, is inevitable, and should
('72', 365, 0, 1, 674158) 366 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 365, 1, 2, 674200) therefore be suffered.
('72', 365, 1, 3, 674223) I do not consider the evil to be inevitable, let alone to be suffered.
('72', 365, 1, 4, 674294) The A. I. S. A. has successfully demonstrated the possibility of the villages manufacturing the whole of the cloth requirement of India simply by employing the leisure hours of the nation in spinning and the anterior processes.
('72', 365, 1, 5, 674522) The difficulty lies in weaning the nation from the use of mill cloth.
('72', 365, 1, 6, 674592) This is not the place to discuss how it can be done.
('72', 365, 1, 7, 674645) My purpose in this note was to give my definition of Indian industry in terms of the millions of villagers, and my reasons for that definition.
('72', 365, 1, 8, 674789) And it should be plain to everyone that national exhibitions should only be for those industries which need public support in every way, not those which are flourishing without the aid of exhibitions and the like, and which organize their own exhibitions.

('72', 365, 4, 12, 675107) BHAI PRANJIVAN, If every school which has functioned for many years looked at its own history, it would find someone or the other [from among its students] who has ultimately risen to fame.
('72', 365, 4, 13, 675297) So, as far as I am concerned, I would consider such a thing a mere accident.
('72', 365, 4, 14, 675374) For an old school like yours the real occasion to feel elated would be when it takes measures leading to improvement and makes progress in such a way that it has no parallel in the field.
('72', 365, 4, 15, 675562) What is there to be proud about accidental achievement?

('72', 366, 3, 6, 675967) You can see that he has attacked Ananda Babu very strongly.
('72', 366, 3, 7, 676027) If he admits that there has been exaggeration in his attack, he should withdraw the charge and give the same publicity to his withdrawal as he gave to the charge.
('72', 366, 3, 8, 676190) And if he does not withdraw it, he should be prepared to prove it.
('72', 366, 3, 9, 676257) Why did he not make these complints to me?

('72', 367, 5, 8, 677306) October 23, 1937
('72', 367, 6, 9, 677323) Gandhiji in winding up the proceedings said he was grateful to all for having come and co operated with him.
('72', 367, 6, 10, 677432) He would look forward to further co operation as the Conference was but the first of the many they would have to have.
('72', 367, 6, 11, 677551) Malaviyaji had sent to him a warning telegram, but he could put him at ease by saying that there was nothing final about the Conference as it was a Conference of seekers, and everyone was invited to offer suggestions and criticisms.
('72', 367, 6, 12, 677784) He had never the idea of carrying through anything by storm.
('72', 367, 6, 13, 677845) The ideas of national education and prohibition were as old as non co operation.
('72', 367, 6, 14, 677926) But the thing in its present shape came to him under the changed circumstances of the country.
('72', 367, 7, 15, 678021) Harijan, 30 10 1937
('72', 367, 8, 16, 678041) 1 Gandhiji placed before the Conference the resolutions prepared by the Com mittee for discussion.
('72', 367, 8, 17, 678140) The following resolutions were passed: (1) That in the opinion of this Conference free and compulsory education be provided for seven years on a nation wide scale.
('72', 367, 8, 18, 678304) (2) That the medium of instruction be the mother tongue.
('72', 367, 8, 19, 678361) (3) That the Conference endorses the proposal made by Mahatma Gandhi that the process of education throughout this period should centre round some form of manual and productive work, and that all the other abilities to be developed or training to be given should, as far as possible, be integrally related to the central handicraft chosen with due regard to the environment of the child.
('72', 367, 8, 20, 678749) (4) That the Conference expects that this system of education will be gradually able to cover the remuneration of the teachers

('72', 369, 5, 11, 680993) 1 WOODBURN PARK, CALCUTTA, October 29, 1937
('72', 369, 6, 12, 681037) MY DEAR NARIMAN,
('72', 369, 7, 13, 681054) I read your extraordinary statement made in Mysore with a great degree of pain.
('72', 369, 7, 14, 681134) I did not write to you till now as I had asked Mahadev to find out from you whether the statement reported in the Press was a correct version of what you had said.
('72', 369, 7, 15, 681298) He told me yesterday that you had confirmed the Press statement.
('72', 369, 7, 16, 681363) Do you not realize that it is a gross distortion of facts?
('72', 369, 7, 17, 681422) Surely, my health had nothing to do with your confession 1, for my work was finished, and my telegram to which evidently you have made reference made mention of my health in connection with your request to postpone decision.
('72', 369, 7, 18, 681647) In suggesting a confession in place of the judgments, if you felt the truth of them, both Syt.
('72', 369, 7, 19, 681742) Bahadurji and I had nothing but your own good in view.
('72', 369, 7, 20, 681797) You were accompanied by your counsel.
('72', 369, 7, 21, 681835) You even pleaded for some alterations in the draft submitted to you.
('72', 369, 7, 22, 681904) Your alterations were accepted.
('72', 369, 7, 23, 681936) Do you remember that you accompanied your confession with the following covering letter?

('72', 370, 7, 10, 682961) CALCUTTA, October 29, 1937
('72', 370, 8, 11, 682988) Gandhiji is understood to have told the deputation that he had taken up the matter very seriously and was determined to do whatever lay in his power.
('72', 370, 8, 12, 683138) He added that he had come to Bengal mainly, if not wholly, for this purpose and was even prepared to see the Viceroy on this question.
('72', 370, 8, 13, 683273) He appealed to the deputation not to do anything which might render a solution of the matter difficult.

('72', 370, 10, 16, 683434) Some persons are consciously or unconsciously imputing to me an approval of fermented toddy.
('72', 370, 10, 17, 683527) I have made it perfectly plain that prohibition affects all intoxicating drinks and drugs without exception.
('72', 370, 10, 18, 683636) Fermented toddy, therefore, can never be tolerated under any scheme of total prohibition.
('72', 370, 10, 19, 683726) But what I have said and what I

('72', 370, 11, 21, 683858) The deputation is understood to have urged Gandhiji to make the question of release of political prisoners a major issue before the country and further urged that the Congress Ministries should go to the length of resigning if necessary over the issue in order to bring pressure on Government.

('72', 371, 1, 2, 684194) repeat is that sweet unfermented toddy, which is called niro 1, should not be prohibited, and that the drinking of it in the place of fermented toddy should be encouraged.
('72', 371, 1, 3, 684366) How it can be done is for the Prohibition Ministers to determine.

('72', 371, 2, 5, 684452) 480. SOCIAL SERVICE CONSCRIPTION
('72', 371, 3, 6, 684485) This valuable thesis 2 does not mean that it contains the only scheme of conscription for social service.
('72', 371, 3, 7, 684591) It shows the feasibility of conscription.
('72', 371, 3, 8, 684633) It points the way to it.
('72', 371, 4, 9, 684658) Usually, conscription has hitherto been used in modern individualist communities for purposes of national defence or imperialist aggression.
('72', 371, 4, 10, 684799) In this country, we would adopt conscription universally, for men as well as women, not for destructive, but for productive purposes of national service and social reconstruction.
('72', 371, 5, 11, 684979) In some countries they allow certain exemptions from such compulsory gratuitous public service, and offer certain compensatory advantages to those who have rendered such service.
('72', 371, 5, 12, 685158) In this country, too, we may have to use a similar device.
('72', 371, 5, 13, 685217) To make this new factor in our national economy function effectively and smoothly, we may have to introduce it by stages.
('72', 371, 5, 14, 685339) But the foundation must be laid immediately.
('72', 371, 6, 15, 685384) This Social Service Conscription should commence with educated males of 18 25 years of age.
('72', 371, 6, 16, 685476) Ancillary organizations of boy or girl volunteers comparable to the British Boy Scouts, or the Italian Ballila, might be set up to support the main force of conscript workers.
('72', 371, 6, 17, 685652) The proportion of educated males in India is about 1 in every 5, and that of educated women 1 in 50. At the age, however, at which conscription should commence the proportion may be appreciably higher, say, 1 in every 3 males, and 1 in every 10 women.
('72', 371, 6, 18, 685904) The term ‘educated’ is used in a very liberal, or even charitable sense, since it includes all those who fulfil the merest test of literacy in their own language.
('72', 371, 6, 19, 686067) It may be expedient to limit the number of conscripts to those of secondary school leaving stage.
('72', 371, 6, 20, 686165) Of the 15 lakhs of such young men available in a province like Bombay, barely 250,000 may be found to satisfy the minimum educational qualification, while less than 100,000 may be found to satisfy the higher qualification suggested above.
('72', 371, 7, 21, 686404) We may well begin the experiment with this latter number.

('72', 372, 1, 2, 686586) educated young men of 18 and over must regard the service rendered by them as a sort of personal ten per cent tax, paid in kind, those paying only who have the means to do so, and their superior education being treated as evidence of their ability.
('72', 372, 2, 3, 686835) The 100,000 educated young men, with whom the experiment may be commenced in Bombay, for example, would be more than ample for our immediate objective, in the 21,484 villages of that province.
('72', 372, 2, 4, 687028) Nearly 5 educated conscripts would be available for each village.
('72', 372, 2, 5, 687094) There may be in addition about 25,000 young women who may supplement the effort later on.
('72', 372, 3, 6, 687184) The most urgent and immediate task of social service consists in: (a) liquidation of illiteracy and ignorance; (b) spread of elementary knowledge of health and hygiene; (c) aiding and improving village productive organization and occupation.
('72', 372, 4, 7, 687426) One of the most important sections in the Legislation for Conscription would have to define carefully the tasks to be allotted to the workers.
('72', 372, 4, 8, 687569) No scheme of conscription should be put into effect, until a comprehensive plan of the work to be done has been prepared and approved for each Province.
('72', 372, 4, 9, 687722) The social service conscripts, mobilized in India on the plan here advocated, would have to be given special training even more than the military conscripts of Europe, since the latter, in their ordinary elementary schooling, generally receive some element of practical training, too, before they join the colours.
('72', 372, 4, 10, 688037) In India our educational system provides no such advantage for the average youth.
('72', 372, 5, 11, 688119) This training organization must be developed in each province out of the existing schools and colleges.
('72', 372, 5, 12, 688223) The instructors in these institutions, particularly of the higher grade, are by no means overworked, or underpaid.
('72', 372, 5, 13, 688338) From the highest to the lowest, in every faculty and branch of knowledge, this profession should be indented upon at least to the extent of one hour per day.
('72', 372, 5, 14, 688496) Such training should be given intensively for 6 months in the one year of the service.
('72', 372, 5, 15, 688583) Work should be assigned, or distributed, among the conscripts in accordance with the aptitude and previous training of each individual.
('72', 372, 6, 16, 688719) Those conscripted in this manner both during training and during the period actually at work will not be paid anything by way of salary.
('72', 372, 6, 17, 688856) But they must be maintained at public expense, and must be taken from their place of work to their homes, and vice versa, at public expense.
('72', 372, 6, 18, 688997) This ought not, however, to cost the State such an amount as to be an insupportable burden, nor be out of proportion to the value of the service rendered.
('72', 372, 7, 19, 689152) All those who willingly, and without any exemption, render such service, as and when it falls due, must at the time of seeking employment for
('72', 373, 0, 1, 689294) 374 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 373, 1, 2, 689336) life, be preferred by all public bodies, and even by private employers on pain of losing such patronage or countenance from the State as is now becoming increasingly common between the State and Industry.
('72', 373, 1, 3, 689541) The basic legislation for such conscription must clearly provide for such compensation.
('72', 373, 2, 4, 689629) The advantages of conscription need not be detailed at any great length.
('72', 373, 2, 5, 689702) In the first place, it would solve, in a great measure, the question of the cost of the indispensable and urgent social service we need in this country.
('72', 373, 2, 6, 689855) At the same time, it would help to inculcate those habits of disciplined work and of concerted action—the so called team work—which are indispensable in a community intent upon making up the leeway that India is suffering from.
('72', 373, 2, 7, 690083) Finally, thanks to such regimentation—the phrase may be used without any fear of misinterpretation—an increasing section of the community will automatically acquire those habits of personal cleanliness and healthful living which most people when left to themselves ignore, and consequently suffer in health, temper and efficiency

('72', 373, 5, 10, 690453) A record of the work of the Educational Conference will be found elsewhere.
('72', 373, 5, 11, 690529) 1 It marks an important stage in the presentation of my plan to the public and the Congress Ministers.
('72', 373, 5, 12, 690632) It was a happy augury that so many Ministers attended.
('72', 373, 5, 13, 690687) The objection and criticism centred round the idea of self support even in the narrow sense I have mentioned.
('72', 373, 5, 14, 690797) Therefore the Conference has made the very cautious declaration it has.
('72', 373, 5, 15, 690869) There is no doubt the Conference had to sail on an unchartered sea.
('72', 373, 5, 16, 690937) There was no complete precedent before it.
('72', 373, 5, 17, 690980) If the idea is sound, it will work itself out in practice.
('72', 373, 5, 18, 691039) After all it is for those who have faith in the self support part to demonstrate it by working schools in accordance with the idea.
('72', 373, 5, 19, 691171) There was a remarkable unanimity so far as the question went of imparting full primary education including the secondary course less English through a vocation.
('72', 373, 5, 20, 691332) The fact that the whole person in the boys and girls has to be developed through a vocation automatically saves the schools from degenerating into factories.
('72', 373, 5, 21, 691490) For over and above the required degree of proficiency in the vocation in which they are trained, the boys and girls will have to show equal proficiency in the

('72', 374, 1, 3, 691797) Dr. Zakir Husain’s Committee’s 1 labours will show how the scheme can be worked in practice and what exactly the boys and girls will be expected to know from year to year.
('72', 374, 1, 4, 691969) Objection has been raised that the Conference’s resolutions 2 were a foregone conclusion.
('72', 374, 1, 5, 692059) It has no validity.
('72', 374, 1, 6, 692079) In the nature of things it was impossible to invite educationists at random to pronounce their views all of a sudden on what to them is undoubtedly a revolutionary plan.
('72', 374, 1, 7, 692249) The invitations had therefore to be restricted to those who as teachers had had at least something to do with vocational training.
('72', 374, 1, 8, 692380) I had myself no idea that the co workers in the cause of national education would receive the new idea with sympathy.
('72', 374, 1, 9, 692498) The wider circle of educationists will undou btedly be invited to consider the scheme when it comes before the public in a concrete and fuller form through the Zakir Husain Committee.
('72', 374, 1, 10, 692682) I would request those educationists who may have helpful suggestions to make to send them at once to Shri Aryanayakam, the Convener and Secretary of the Committee at Wardha.
('72', 374, 1, 11, 692856) One of the speakers at the Conference emphasized the fact that education of little boys and girls could be more effectively handled by women than men and by mothers rather than maidens.
('72', 374, 1, 12, 693042) From another standpoint, too, they are in a better position than men to answer Prof.
('72', 374, 1, 13, 693127) Shah’s conscription scheme.
('72', 374, 1, 14, 693155) Here is undoubtedly an opportunity for patriotic women with leisure to offer their services to a cause which ranks amongst the noblest of all causes.
('72', 374, 1, 15, 693305) But if they come forward, they will have to go through a sound preliminary training.
('72', 374, 1, 16, 693390) Needy women in search of a living will serve no useful purpose by thinking of joining the movement as a career.
('72', 374, 1, 17, 693502) If they approach the scheme, they should do so in a spirit of pure service and make it a life mission.
('72', 374, 1, 18, 693605) They will fail and be severely disappointed if they approach it in a selfish spirit.
('72', 374, 1, 19, 693690) If the cultured women of India will make common cause with the villagers, and that too through their children, they will produce a silent and grand revolution in the village life of India.
('72', 374, 1, 20, 693879) Will they respond?

('72', 374, 2, 22, 693918) 1 The Committee, appointed under the Chairmanship of Zakir Husain, was to prepare a planned syllabus on the lines of the resolutions passed at the Conference and submit its report to Gandhiji within a month.
('72', 374, 2, 23, 694126) Other members of the Committee were: E. W. Aryanayakam, Khwaja Ghulam Saiyidain, Vinoba Bhave, D. B. Kalelkar, Shrikrishnadas Jaju, J. C. Kumarappa, Ashadevi, Kishorelal Mashruwala and K. T. Shah.

('72', 375, 2, 3, 694465) [CALCUTTA, October 30, 1937] 2
('72', 375, 3, 4, 694496) When Gandhiji visited the political prisoners in Alipur Jail 3 they were fresh from the Andamans, and were anxious to go back to hunger strike if they were not released, or rather if Gandhiji declared that he had failed in his mission.
('72', 375, 3, 5, 694732) But they promised to do nothing until Gandhiji definitely told them that he had failed.
('72', 375, 3, 6, 694820) What was to be the position now?
('72', 375, 3, 7, 694853) How long were they to wait?
('72', 375, 3, 8, 694881) Gandhiji said to them: There should be no hunger strike on any account.
('72', 375, 3, 9, 694953) Though there are circumstances conceivable in which a hunger strike may be justified, hunger strike in order to secure release or redress of grievances is wrong.
('72', 375, 3, 10, 695115) And if you resort to it whilst I am carrying on negotiations, you will clip my wings.
('72', 375, 3, 11, 695201) But why think of a hunger strike when you have got me as a good substitute for a hunger strike?
('72', 375, 3, 12, 695297) My days are numbered.
('72', 375, 3, 13, 695319) I am not likely to live long, maybe I may live a year or little more and let me tell you that much of that time is going to be given in order to secure your release.
('72', 375, 3, 14, 695485) I want to see you discharged before I die.
('72', 375, 3, 15, 695528) That is the word I am giving to you, and I want you to give me your word that so long as I live to work for you, you will not go on hunger strike.
('72', 375, 3, 16, 695675) I cannot have peace or comfort so long as I have not secured your discharge.
('72', 375, 3, 17, 695752) You have to believe what I say.
('72', 375, 3, 18, 695784) Man believes and lives.
('72', 375, 3, 19, 695808) My function is not that of a lawyer but of a humanitarian and a votary of non violence.
('72', 375, 3, 20, 695896) Non violence will not spread so long as you prisoners are kept in prison, and that is why I have staked my life for the mission.
('72', 375, 3, 21, 696025) No thought, therefore, of hunger strike please.

('72', 376, 3, 10, 696637) I had two hours with them.
('72', 376, 3, 11, 696664) The release is not going to be a simple or easy affair.
('72', 376, 3, 12, 696720) I shall leave no stone unturned to secure it.

('72', 377, 6, 11, 698185) Your speech 1 was sent two days ago.
('72', 377, 6, 12, 698222) As you must have seen, I made some vital amendments.
('72', 377, 6, 13, 698275) You need not accept them, unless they appeal to you as sound.
('72', 377, 6, 14, 698337) Your suggestions are all good.
('72', 377, 6, 15, 698368) But will they be accepted and, if accepted, will they be acted up to?
('72', 377, 6, 16, 698438) You will know your audience and deal with the programme as you think best.

('72', 377, 6, 19, 698605) I did not object.
('72', 377, 6, 20, 698623) But you shall decide.
('72', 377, 6, 21, 698645) All will be weather permitting.

('72', 377, 6, 24, 698756) He is not here.
('72', 377, 6, 25, 698772) I can’t go to Darjeeling in the present state of my health.
('72', 377, 6, 26, 698832) I have to reach the Frontier Province on 17th and not later than 20th.
('72', 377, 6, 27, 698903) Khan Saheb wants me there for 20 days.
('72', 377, 6, 28, 698942) That means that I may not be back in Segaon before 10th December.
('72', 377, 6, 29, 699008) I am sorry.
('72', 377, 6, 30, 699020) What will you do?
('72', 377, 6, 31, 699038) Could you not be in Simla till then, if Simla agrees with you?

('72', 377, 6, 33, 699162) But you know what your body can stand.

('72', 378, 2, 3, 699537) 1 WOODBURN PARK, CALCUTTA November 1, 1937
('72', 378, 3, 4, 699580) DEAR JAWAHARLAL, Enclosed herewith is the judgement of the inquiry committee about the two issues raised by Shri Nariman in his correspondence with you and me.
('72', 378, 3, 5, 699740) 1 I had thought that Shri Nariman’s acceptance of my recommendation to make a confession 2 which was to take the place of the judgement was a fair ending to an inquiry which gave me many an anxious moment.
('72', 378, 3, 6, 699946) But Shri Nariman’s recantation of the confession which l first saw only in the Press alters the position and reveals the painful state of Shri Nariman’s mind.
('72', 378, 3, 7, 700105) The recantation contains a patent untruth as pointed out by me in my letter 3 to Shri Nariman which you will find in the enclosure.
('72', 378, 3, 8, 700237) I recall the fact that Shri Nariman himself courted the inquiry and deliberately wanted an investigation into the charge made on him by Sardar Vallabhbhai of a grave breach of trust in the matter of the Bombay election in 1934. In his letter addressed to you occurs the following sentence:
('72', 378, 4, 9, 700527) If the verdict of such an independent tribunal and enquiry tends to blame me in the slightest degree, then I will willingly submit to any penalty which you or any other authority chooses to impose, but at the same time hoping and expecting that, if the blame is found elsewhere, similar indiscriminating judgment should follow regardless of personalities or personal considerations.
('72', 378, 4, 10, 700910) In his letters to me (I have not the copies with me), he went further and said that, if he was found guilty of the Sardar’s charge, he would consider himself to be unworthy of holding any office of trust.
('72', 378, 4, 11, 701115) I am of opinion that by his conduct Shri Nariman has proved himself unworthy of holding any position of trust, not only because he has been found guilty of grave breach of trust in 1934 election and has failed to prove the charge brought by him against Sardar Vallab

('72', 379, 5, 7, 701989) November 1, 1937 I have come to the conclusion that it would be best if all [of you] resigned.
('72', 379, 5, 8, 702084) Even if the others don’t resign, you should.
('72', 379, 5, 9, 702129) Jamnalal is sure to resign.
('72', 379, 5, 10, 702157) Who will be left then?
('72', 379, 5, 11, 702180) Rajendra Babu?
('72', 379, 5, 12, 702195) And won’t [it] be bankruptcy?
('72', 379, 5, 13, 702225) Bhulabhai also will leave.
('72', 379, 5, 14, 702252) But it will not matter even if he does not.
('72', 379, 5, 15, 702296) I don’t think that Maulana’s support is necessary.
('72', 379, 5, 16, 702347) If he does not resign, a time will come when he will be forced to resign.
('72', 379, 5, 17, 702421) I have observed that Subhas is not at all dependable.
('72', 379, 5, 18, 702475) Howevere, there is nobody but he who can be the President 1. I thought hard last night and again now.
('72', 379, 5, 19, 702577) Let others do what they like, I am convinced that you should resign.
('72', 379, 5, 20, 702646) If each does not take care of his own interest nothing will be done and the whole game will be lost.
('72', 379, 5, 21, 702747) I will certainly bring up the Nariman issue.
('72', 379, 5, 22, 702792) But he may not wish to do anything.
('72', 379, 5, 23, 702828) All the same, let us know what the other members say.
('72', 379, 5, 24, 702882) What do Deo 2 and Patwardhan believe?
('72', 379, 5, 25, 702920) What is Bhulabhai’s view?
('72', 379, 5, 26, 702946) What weight can be attached to the opinion of one person alone?
('72', 379, 5, 27, 703010) The reasons for resigning are obvious.
('72', 379, 5, 28, 703049) The Mysore chap ter 3 and increasing differences of opinion .
('72', 379, 5, 29, 703111) 4 You should make it clear that you cannot continue in the face of such strong differences in the Committee.
('72', 379, 5, 30, 703220) Think over the whole thing carefully yourself.
('72', 379, 5, 31, 703267) Nobody else’s advice will help you in this matter.
('72', 379, 5, 32, 703318) I see nothing but ignominy in your continuing.

('72', 380, 5, 20, 704409) November 1, 1937 Before leaving Calcutta I should like to tell the public what actually is the position regarding my efforts to secure the relief which I promised the Andamans prisoners I should make with all my heart.
('72', 380, 5, 21, 704628) In pursuance of these efforts and by the kind permission of the Bengal Government, I saw the repatriates from the Andamans on October 30. 2 I had spent nearly two hours with them.
('72', 380, 5, 22, 704808) I am in correspondence with the Government in the matter and I expect to return to Calcutta on the 11th instant, when I hope to see His Excellency the Governor and, if necessary, subject to the Government’s permission, see both the prisoners and the detenus.
('72', 380, 5, 23, 705067) Meanwhile, I trust that the prisoners, wherever they may be, will not make the position difficult by resuming their hunger strike.
('72', 380, 5, 24, 705198) I have information that many prisoners are getting restive over the delay I can only give them the assurance that, so far as I am concerned, there shall be no remissness on my part in the effort.
('72', 380, 5, 25, 705394) So far as the public are concerned, they should know that the public agitation for securing relief continues unabated.

('72', 381, 5, 10, 706260) Merely sending you an acknowledgement I held to be unnecessary.
('72', 381, 5, 11, 706324) I had a long chat with the Maulana.
('72', 381, 5, 12, 706360) So far as I could see, he agrees with my reading of the Koran apart from traditional and sectarian interpretations.
('72', 381, 5, 13, 706476) But as he may be the only divine in India to give the liberal and universal interpretation to the Koran, he does not want to come out as a radical reformer and thus impair his influence among the Indian Muslim world.
('72', 381, 5, 14, 706693) He has therefore himself written to Habib 3 to come to Calcutta with Sohaila 4 whilst I am here.
('72', 381, 5, 15, 706790) I have therefore telegraphed to Habib 5 to come here.
('72', 381, 5, 16, 706844) Please believe me when I tell you that I have been always thinking of you, your difficulties and your sorrows ever since the Hamida 6 affair has cropped up.
('72', 381, 5, 17, 707001) I have acted, will act and am still acting as if the living image of Abbas Saheb was in front of me, as witness of all I am doing.
('72', 381, 5, 18, 707132) More than that I could not do.

('72', 383, 7, 12, 709179) November 9, 1937 I had nearly two hours’ talk with His Excellency at Barrackpore.
('72', 383, 7, 13, 709261) Owing to my illness the interview was considerately arranged on the grounds.
('72', 383, 7, 14, 709338) Naturally the talk was confined to relief to political prisoners and detenus.
('72', 383, 7, 15, 709416) The public will not expect me to describe the conversations in detail for the sake of the common cause.
('72', 383, 7, 16, 709520) I would ask the Press and public to be satisfied with my statement that I have placed my point of view to the best of my abilities and that it was fully discussed between His Excellency and myself.
('72', 383, 7, 17, 709718) I would like the Press not to indulge in conjectures about the conversations which have to be in the nature of things private.

('72', 384, 13, 18, 710556) I shall go through what you have sent me and I shall write to you if I have anything to say about it.
('72', 384, 13, 19, 710658) I appreciate your keenness to complete the work.
('72', 384, 13, 20, 710707) However, it should not be allowed to delay what you can give [now].
('72', 384, 13, 21, 710775) Not that I fear any unnecessary delay on your part.
('72', 384, 13, 22, 710827) But some of my statements can easily be misconstrued, and so I think I should caution you.
('72', 384, 13, 23, 710918) It sometimes becomes one’s duty to offer a thing which, although incomplete, is a hundred per cent true and proved by experience.

('72', 385, 1, 4, 711359) However, I would certainly be sorry if someone who lacked a systematic knowledge of every branch of this science did not make an effort to acquire such knowledge.
('72', 385, 1, 5, 711522) Despair I would still not know.
('72', 385, 1, 6, 711554) Because so long as I have faith in myself, faith in khadi—and am trying, as best I can, to acquire knowledge of this science—why should I despair?

('72', 385, 5, 14, 712030) Whilst there are things which cannot be accepted, there are suggestions which are worthy of consideration.

('72', 385, 5, 16, 712213) That way lies utter failure.

('72', 385, 8, 20, 712410) Congress Ministers have a fourfold responsibility.
('72', 385, 8, 21, 712461) As an individual a Minister is primarily responsible to his constituents.
('72', 385, 8, 22, 712535) If he is satisfied that he no longer enjoys their confidence or that he has changed the views for which he was elected, he resigns.
('72', 385, 8, 23, 712667) Collectively the Ministers are responsible to the majority of the legislators who, by a no confidence vote or similar means, may any moment drive them out of office.
('72', 385, 8, 24, 712833) But a Congress Minister owes his position and responsi bility to his Provincial Congress Committee and the A. I. C. C. also.

('72', 386, 1, 2, 713066) So long as all these four bodies act in co ordination, Ministers have smooth sailing in the discharge of their duty.
('72', 386, 1, 3, 713183) The recent meeting of the A. I. C. C. 1 showed, however, that some of its members were not at all in accord with the Congress Ministries, specially that of C. Rajagopalachari, the Prime Minister of Madras.
('72', 386, 1, 4, 713389) Healthy, well informed, balanced criticism is the ozone of public life.
('72', 386, 1, 5, 713461) A most democratic Minister is likely to go wrong without ceaseless watch from the public.
('72', 386, 1, 6, 713551) But the resolution moved in the.
('72', 386, 1, 7, 713584) A. I. C. C. criticizing the Congress Ministries, and still more the speeches, were wide of the mark.
('72', 386, 1, 8, 713685) The critics had not cared to study the facts.
('72', 386, 1, 9, 713731) They had not before them C. Rajagopalachari’s reply.
('72', 386, 1, 10, 713784) They knew that he was most eager to come and answer his critics.
('72', 386, 1, 11, 713849) But severe illness prevented him from coming.
('72', 386, 1, 12, 713895) The critics owed it to their representative that they should postpone the consideration of the resolution.
('72', 386, 1, 13, 714002) Let them study and take to heart what Jawaharlal Nehru has said in his elaborate statement on the matter.
('72', 386, 1, 14, 714108) I am convinced that in their action the critics departed from truth and non violence.
('72', 386, 1, 15, 714194) If they had carried the A.I.C.C. with them, the Madras Ministers at least would have resigned, although they seemingly enjoy the full confidence of the majority of the legislators.
('72', 386, 1, 16, 714375) Surely, that would not have been a desirable result.
('72', 386, 1, 17, 714428) Much more offensive, in my opinion, was the Mysore resolution 2; and the pity of it is that it was carried with practically nobody to speak out for truth.
('72', 386, 1, 18, 714583) I hold no brief for Mysore.
('72', 386, 1, 19, 714611) There are many things I would like the Maharaja to reform.
('72', 386, 1, 20, 714670) But the Congress policy is to give even an opponent his due.
('72', 386, 1, 21, 714731) In my opinion the Mysore resolution was ultra vires of the resolution of non interference 3. This, so far as I am aware, has never been repealed.
('72', 386, 1, 22, 714877) On merits the A. I. C. C. was not out to deal with the State as a whole.
('72', 386, 1, 23, 714950) It was dealing only with
('72', 386, 2, 24, 714975) 1 At Calcutta
('72', 386, 3, 25, 714989) 2 Which read: “This meeting of the A. I. C. C. expresses its emphatic protest against the ruthless policy of repression as indicated by the inauguration of various restrictive and prohibitory orders and political prosecutions launched in the Mysore State and also against the suppression of civil rights and liberties by denying the elementary rights of speech, assemblage and association.
('72', 386, 3, 26, 715379) This meeting sends its fraternal greetings to the people of Mysore and wishes them all success in their legitimate non violent struggle and appeals to the people of Indian States and British India to give all support and encouragement to the people of Mysore in their struggle against the State for right of self determination.”

('72', 387, 1, 3, 715810) The resolution did not set forth the correct state of affairs, and the speeches were full of passion and without regard to the facts of the case.
('72', 387, 1, 4, 715956) The A. I. C. C. should have appointed, if it was so minded, a committee even of one person to ascertain the facts before proceeding to pronounce judgment.
('72', 387, 1, 5, 716111) The least it can do in such matters, if it has any regard for truth and non violence, is first to let the Working Committee pronounce its judgment on them and then, if necessary, review them in a judicial manner.
('72', 387, 1, 6, 716324) I have purposely refrained in the case of either resolution from going into details to prove my submission.
('72', 387, 1, 7, 716432) I am saving my limited energy and am leaving the matter also to the good sense of the members of the A.I.C.C., which has since 1920 assumed a unique importance and doubly so after the office acceptance resolution 1.

('72', 388, 5, 10, 718182) I have been only dictating the most necessary correspondence.
('72', 388, 5, 11, 718244) But the imperious singer won’t rest till I promised to let you have a line.
('72', 388, 5, 12, 718320) For I am told you are visibly growing in years and for us hope in wisdom too.
('72', 388, 5, 13, 718398) Your birthday is nearing!

('72', 388, 8, 17, 718666) MY DEAR UNTOUCHABLE, After a lapse of three days I have two notes from you today.
('72', 388, 8, 18, 718748) I still do not do any correspondence.
('72', 388, 8, 19, 718786) Both the hands are weak.
('72', 388, 8, 20, 718811) I work the right for Harijan articles on Mondays.
('72', 388, 8, 21, 718861) But I must give you a few lines today.

('72', 389, 1, 3, 719153) I do not and cannot get it here.
('72', 389, 1, 4, 719186) The detenu work occupies my thoughts and taxes my mental energy as it must while I am on the scene.
('72', 389, 1, 5, 719286) That by itself sufficiently disturbs the mental relaxation I want so badly.
('72', 389, 1, 6, 719362) I say nothing about the result of my labours.
('72', 389, 1, 7, 719408) For I do not know.
('72', 389, 1, 8, 719427) I am not without hope.
('72', 389, 1, 9, 719450) Do you remember you wanted me not on the opening day but the 2nd or the closing day?
('72', 389, 1, 10, 719535) It makes no difference to me.
('72', 389, 1, 11, 719565) Do not translate your address literally.

('72', 389, 6, 21, 719920) DEAR FRIEND, With reference to your letter of the 16th instant, I am quite clear that no Congressman can attend farewell parties to the Governor and officials, no matter where and by whom given, that is, so long as the Congress ban lasts.
('72', 389, 6, 22, 720159) My interview 1 with His Excellency as also with the Ministers whether at my host’s place 2 or at their place 3, was not a social or official function.
('72', 389, 6, 23, 720310) And what I, having ceased to be even a four anna member, may do with impunity, Congressmen may not.
('72', 389, 6, 24, 720410) The instance you have quoted bears no analogy to mine.

('72', 390, 2, 3, 720655) KHARAGPUR, November 17, 1937 For the present I have no intention of issuing any Press state ment about my discussions with Bengal Ministers.
('72', 390, 3, 4, 720796) On being told that the Bengal Government proposed to issue a Press communi que on their negotiations with Gandhiji tomorrow, Mahatmaji said: If on seeing their communique, I feel that any statement is necessary from me, then I may issue one, but that can only be from Wardha.
('72', 390, 4, 5, 721072) Gandhiji then informed the United Press that he was coming to Calcutta very soon.

('72', 390, 6, 8, 721219) ON WAY TO WARDHA, November 18, 1937
('72', 390, 7, 9, 721255) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL, I fancy I could read the personal letter in your eyes as you were hovering round me that awful Sunday night and silent Monday.
('72', 390, 7, 10, 721402) The weakness has not yet left me.
('72', 390, 7, 11, 721436) I need prolonged rest from all mental toil, but that perhaps cannot be had.
('72', 390, 7, 12, 721512) This I write to report to you what I have done about the priso ners in Bengal, and to ascertain whether it meets with your approval.
('72', 390, 7, 13, 721645) The negotiations have been a taxing affair.
('72', 390, 7, 14, 721689) Before entering upon them I had consulted the two Brothers 3 as to the desirability of secu ring relief through negotiations.
('72', 390, 7, 15, 721815) It was possible to be indifferent as to the result and rely upon the growth of public opinion forcing release whenever it was to come.
('72', 390, 7, 16, 721950) The Brothers were emphatically for negotiations, whilst public agitation continued.
('72', 390, 7, 17, 722034) I unfolded my plan also and it was after the style of my telegram 4 to the Andamans
('72', 390, 8, 18, 722118) 1 Gandhiji reached Kharagpur Station at 4 p.
('72', 390, 8, 19, 722163) A representative of the United Press approached him in the waiting room.

('72', 391, 1, 3, 722479) And so I saw the repatriates 1, detenus brought back from Deoli and last night the Hijli prisoners.
('72', 391, 1, 4, 722579) The Ministers have agreed to release what they call ‘village and home domiciled’ detenus almost forthwith, and inside of four months to release those in the detenu camps whom they may consider to be safe.
('72', 391, 1, 5, 722784) For the rest they will accept my recommendation, if they are not earlier released.
('72', 391, 1, 6, 722867) My recommendation will depend upon my ascertaining the present belief of the detenus.
('72', 391, 1, 7, 722953) If I am able to say to the Government that they do not believe in methods of violence for the attainment of independence and that they will pursue such Congress activities as are approved of by the Congress from time to time, they will release them.
('72', 391, 1, 8, 723203) A declaration of policy might be made any time.
('72', 391, 1, 9, 723251) I need not go into the details of the conversations with the prisoners in the several prisons and in Hijli camp.
('72', 391, 1, 10, 723364) I wonder if all this commends itself to you.
('72', 391, 1, 11, 723409) If you strongly disapprove of it, I would like you to telegraph.
('72', 391, 1, 12, 723474) Otherwise I shall await your letter.
('72', 391, 2, 13, 723511) The strikes in Ahmedabad of which I have no knowledge, except from what I gather from the papers, as also what the papers say about Sholapur, 2 disturbed me.
('72', 391, 2, 14, 723669) If we cannot control the situation either because a section of the Congressmen would not submit to Congress discipline or because the Congress cannot control the activities of those who are outside the Congress influence, our holding of offices is bound to prove detrimental to the Congress cause.
('72', 391, 3, 15, 723967) The ‘Bande Mataram’ controversy has not yet died out.
('72', 391, 3, 16, 724021) Many Bengalis are sore at heart over the W. C. decision.
('72', 391, 3, 17, 724078) 3 Subhas told me he was trying to calm the atmosphere.
('72', 391, 3, 18, 724133) I expect to have to go back to Bengal soon after the assum ption of office by the incoming Governor.

('72', 392, 4, 10, 725077) NIMU, I cannot write myself, and hence I am dictating this letter.
('72', 392, 4, 11, 725144) I read your letter just now in the train.
('72', 392, 4, 12, 725186) A student’s dharma is difficult to perform.
('72', 392, 4, 13, 725230) Even if it seemed selfish at first sight, if the.
('72', 392, 4, 14, 725280) aim was altruistic it could be shown to be not selfish.
('72', 392, 4, 15, 725336) The student’s case is like that of a brave warrior who may not turn back from the battle field in the face of any obstacle, or a businessman who having gone to a distant land for earning wealth cannot return even though his family might be facing ruin.
('72', 392, 4, 16, 725589) Here, circumstances are favourable for you to suspend your study.
('72', 392, 4, 17, 725655) But credit lies in not being tempted by them.
('72', 392, 4, 18, 725701) This is dharma.
('72', 392, 4, 19, 725717) Whether or not you should follow it will depend on your strength.
('72', 392, 4, 20, 725783) If you have understood this dharma and if you have the strength to follow it, forget the outside world and remain where you are.
('72', 392, 4, 21, 725912) God is the Protector of us all.
('72', 392, 4, 22, 725944) He takes care of everybody.
('72', 392, 4, 23, 725972) I, therefore, see no reason for you to yield to moha 2. Even if Sarita 3 invites you, I would advise you to decline to go.
('72', 392, 4, 24, 726095) But please do not treat my advice as an order.
('72', 392, 4, 25, 726142) I am only explaining to you what I consider to be dharma in such circumstances.
('72', 392, 4, 26, 726222) But I don’t insist that you too should regard that as the only true dharma.
('72', 392, 4, 27, 726298) I don’t know where my ship is drifting.
('72', 392, 4, 28, 726338) It is sailing on.
('72', 392, 4, 29, 726356) The Captain is God.
('72', 392, 4, 30, 726376) Why, then should I worry where it is going?
('72', 392, 4, 31, 726420) And I am not worrying.
('72', 392, 4, 32, 726443) It is bound to disappear some day.

('72', 393, 2, 3, 726742) The Executive Committee of the Harijan Sevak Sangh has passed the following resolution:
('72', 393, 3, 4, 726830) The Executive Committee of the All India Harijan Sevak Sangh notes with satisfaction the progress of the temple entry campaign in Malabar district and Cochin State and the growing volume of public support in these places for temple entry for Harijans, and gives full support to this work.
('72', 393, 3, 5, 727119) This Committee further requests the Government of Madras and the Government of Cochin to help the rapid emancipation of Harijans by facilitating the declaration of all Hindu temples within their jurisdiction open to the Harijans.
('72', 393, 3, 6, 727349) It is hardly right to bracket the two Governments together.
('72', 393, 3, 7, 727409) The Government of Cochin is a personal Government under a Hindu Prince who owns the temples of Cochin or who is the spiritual head of most of them.
('72', 393, 3, 8, 727557) It is, therefore, within his right and, in my opinion, it is his duty to open the temples within his jurisdiction to the Harijans precisely as they are open to the so called savarna Hindus.
('72', 393, 3, 9, 727747) The appeal addressed to the Cochin Maharaja is, therefore, quite the proper thing.
('72', 393, 3, 10, 727830) But the Madras Government is a government responsible to the people of Madras which include all classes and creeds.
('72', 393, 3, 11, 727946) It cannot, therefore, with any propriety pass legislation like the Cochin Durbar opening to Harijans all the temples within its jurisdiction.
('72', 393, 3, 12, 728088) The temples can only be opened to Harijans either by the trustees of their own motion or at the instance of the savarna visitors who are in the habit of visiting particular temples.
('72', 393, 3, 13, 728270) But the Madras Government can and ought to bring in enabling legislation.
('72', 393, 3, 14, 728344) It has been contended that some judgment of a court of law prevents temples from being opened to Harijans even if all the savarna trustees desire it.
('72', 393, 3, 15, 728494) At the time of the Guruvayur Temple agitation 1 I had discussed this judgment and expressed my doubt as to its validity and meaning.
('72', 393, 3, 16, 728627) But it will be remembered that in order to remove any doubts an attempt was made in the Central Legislative Assembly to bring in an enabling bill.
('72', 393, 3, 17, 728774) The attempt was unsuccessful.
('72', 393, 3, 18, 728804) 2 But I apprehend that under the new Constitution the Provincial Legislatures have the power to bring in and

('72', 394, 1, 2, 729021) pass enabling legislation.
('72', 394, 1, 3, 729048) The Congress Ministries are pledged to remove untouchability in every shape and form.
('72', 394, 1, 4, 729134) Savarna Hindus were pledged at the time of the Yeravda Pact among many other things to fling open temples to Harijans.
('72', 394, 1, 5, 729253) 1 At the very first opportunity, therefore, Congress Ministries have to bring in legislation, if it is legally within their power, to abolish untouchability in law and to enable trustees or temple goers to open the temples to Harijans and thus put an end to the age long curse of untouchability.
('72', 394, 1, 6, 729549) The Provi ncial Harijan Sevak Sangh can certainly mobilize savarna Hindu opinion in favour of the step.
('72', 394, 1, 7, 729653) I observe that Harijans are already moving in the matter and rightly pressing for the opening of temples.
('72', 394, 1, 8, 729759) I see too that Rao Bahadur M. C. Rajah has a Bill to his credit.
('72', 394, 1, 9, 729824) I hope that he will keep himself in touch with the Ministers and act in accordance with their advice.
('72', 394, 1, 10, 729926) For he and they have a common cause to pursue.

('72', 394, 4, 13, 730012) The Sholapur affair and the labour unrest in Cawnpore and Ahmedabad show how uncertain is the Congress control over forces of disorder.
('72', 394, 4, 14, 730148) Tribes called criminal cannot be dealt with radically differently from the past practice without ascertaining how they will behave.
('72', 394, 4, 15, 730280) One difference certainly be made at once.
('72', 394, 4, 16, 730322) They may not be treated as criminals to be dreaded and shunned, but efforts should be made to brother them and bring them under the national influence.
('72', 394, 4, 17, 730474) It is said that the red flag men (Communists) have been at work among the men in the Sholapur settlement.
('72', 394, 4, 18, 730580) Are they Congressmen?
('72', 394, 4, 19, 730602) If they are, why are they not found by the side of the Congressmen who are Ministers at the wish of the Congress?
('72', 394, 4, 20, 730716) If they are not Congressmen, do they seek to destroy the Congress influence and prestige?
('72', 394, 4, 21, 730806) If they are not Congressmen and do seek to destroy the Congress prestige, why have Congressmen been unable to reach these tribes and make them proof against the blandishments of those who would exploit their traditional violent tendencies, so called or real?

('72', 395, 1, 2, 731203) Why are we living in Ahmedabad and Cawnpore in perpetual dread of lightning or unauthorized strikes?
('72', 395, 1, 3, 731304) Is the Congress unable to influence organized labour in the right direction?
('72', 395, 1, 4, 731381) We may not distrust Government notices issued in the provinces administered by Congress Ministers.
('72', 395, 1, 5, 731480) It will not do to belittle their notices as we used to treat the irresponsible Government’s notices.
('72', 395, 1, 6, 731581) If we distrust Congress Ministers or are dissatisfied with them, they can be dismissed without ceremony.
('72', 395, 1, 7, 731686) But while they are permitted to remain in office, their notices and appeals should receive the full hearted support of all Congressmen.
('72', 395, 1, 8, 731822) On no other condition can the holding of offices by Congres smen be justified.
('72', 395, 1, 9, 731901) If in spite of honest effort by Congressmen, forces of disorder cannot be brought under control without the assistance of the police and the military, in my opinion acceptance by the Congress of the burden of office loses all force and meaning, and the sooner the Ministers are withdrawn the better it would be for the Congress and its struggle to achieve complete independence.
('72', 395, 1, 10, 732280) My hope is that the outbreak in the Sholapur settlement and the labour unrest in Ahmedabad and Cawnpore are symptoms of the exaggerated expectations of radical betterment of the condition of labour and even of the so called criminal tribes.
('72', 395, 1, 11, 732521) Then the Congress should have no difficulty in checking disorders.
('72', 395, 1, 12, 732588) If, on the contrary, they are signs of weakness of Congress control, the whole situation arising out of acceptance of office by Congressmen requires reviewing.
('72', 395, 1, 13, 732748) One thing is certain.
('72', 395, 1, 14, 732770) The Congress organization needs streng thening and purging.
('72', 395, 1, 15, 732830) On the Congress register there should be, not merely a few lacs of men and women, but every adult male or female above the age of 18, no matter to what faith they belong.
('72', 395, 1, 16, 733001) And these should be on the register in order to receive a proper training or education in the practice of truth and non violence in terms of the national struggle.
('72', 395, 1, 17, 733165) I have always conceived the Congress to be the greatest school of political education for the whole nation.
('72', 395, 1, 18, 733273) But the Congress is far off from the realization of the ideal.
('72', 395, 1, 19, 733336) One hears of manipulations of Congress registers, and of bogus names being put in for the purpose of showing numbers.
('72', 395, 1, 20, 733454) When the registers have been honestly prepared there is no attempt to keep in close touch with the voters.
('72', 395, 1, 21, 733561) The question naturally arises: Do we really believe in truth and non violence, in sustained work and discipline, in the efficacy of the
('72', 396, 0, 1, 733697) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 397
('72', 396, 1, 2, 733741) fourfold constructive programme?
('72', 396, 1, 3, 733774) If we do, sufficient has been achieved to show, during the working of the Congress Ministries for the past few months, that complete independence is much nearer than when offices were accepted.
('72', 396, 1, 4, 733968) If, however, we are not sure of our own chosen aims, we need not wonder if one fine morning we discover that we had committed a grave blunder in embarking upon office acceptance.
('72', 396, 1, 5, 734147) My conscience as a or the prime mover in the direction of office acceptance is quite clear.
('72', 396, 1, 6, 734239) I advised it on the supposition that the Congressmen as a whole were sound not only on the goal but also on the truthful and non violent means.
('72', 396, 1, 7, 734383) If we lack that political faith in the means, office acceptance may prove to be a trap.

('72', 396, 3, 10, 734502) PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS AND HARIJANS Thakkar Bapa sends the following for publication:
('72', 396, 4, 11, 734588) (a) The Executive Committee of the Harijan Sevak Sangh urges upon the Congress Provincial Governments to issue declarations of their policies regarding the removal of untouchability of Harijans at an early date.
('72', 396, 4, 12, 734800) (b) This Committee further requests Provincial Governments to create special departments and appoint special officers, where they do not already exist, to look after the uplift work of the Harijans in general and particularly to the removal of disabilities with regard to the use of common schools, public wells, tanks and water taps, and help the Harijans in the enjoyment of their civic rights.
('72', 396, 4, 13, 735197) (c) Further, this Committee requests the Provincial Governments to draw the attention of Municipal and other local bodies towards the deplorable living and service conditions of sweepers and scavengers employed by them and asks them to give the latter better amenities of life by providing them with better housing, water and lighting facilities and a decent and adequate pay and making their service permanent.
('72', 396, 4, 14, 735609) (d) This Committee further draws the attention of the Provincial Governments to clause 9 of the Yeravda Pact of September 1932 which is as follows, and requests them to give effect to the same: “9. In every province out of the educational grant an adequate sum shall be earmarked for providing educational facilities to members of the Depressed Classes.” Why should the Committee only urge in (a) the Congress Provincial Governments to do their duty?
('72', 396, 4, 15, 736060) I think the resolution of the Executive Committee of the Harijan Sevak Sangh applies to all the Governments.
('72', 396, 4, 16, 736169) And where the Governments are supine or indifferent the Opposition should wake them to a sense of their duty.

('72', 397, 8, 10, 736624) WARDHA, November 21, 1937 The Government of Bengal deserve congratulations for the decision they have arrived at on the question of detenus.
('72', 397, 8, 11, 736765) Congressmen will be wrong if they judge the communique 1 by Congress measures.
('72', 397, 8, 12, 736844) The Bengal Ministry are not bound by the Congress election manifesto, nor do they share Congress ideology.
('72', 397, 8, 13, 736951) Nevertheless, they have travelled along Congress lines to a considerable extent.
('72', 397, 8, 14, 737032) It would be wrong not to make this admission.
('72', 397, 8, 15, 737078) Even a political opponent is entitled to credit when this is due.
('72', 397, 8, 16, 737144) In my opinion the Bengal Cabinet have responded to public opinion in a measure, though not to the extent I had expected.
('72', 397, 8, 17, 737265) I would be unfair if I did not mention the fact that H. E. the Governor was helpful in the matter.
('72', 397, 8, 18, 737364) The Ministers could hardly have carried out their wishes but for the Governor’s co operation.
('72', 397, 8, 19, 737458) I regard the communique as an earnest of much more to come.
('72', 397, 8, 20, 737518) I share the opinion, expressed in the communique, that much willdepend upon reaction to the Government’s decision by the public and the 1,100 detenus who have been, or will be, released from all restraint.
('72', 397, 8, 21, 737724) The requirement of supplying change of addresses to the police robs the release order of some of its grace.
('72', 397, 8, 22, 737832) It betokens a timidity I wish the Government of Bengal had not betrayed.
('72', 397, 8, 23, 737905) But much need not be made of what, I hope, is mere formality.
('72', 397, 9, 24, 737967) 1Vide “Bengal Government’s Communique”, 18 11 1937
('72', 398, 0, 1, 738018) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 399
('72', 398, 1, 2, 738062) I am sure that a full measure of relief will be forthcoming, if the atmosphere of non violence is not disturbed, by the step taken by the Government.
('72', 398, 1, 3, 738212) Even Congress insists on observance of non violence; indeed, it is its political creed.
('72', 398, 1, 4, 738300) Congress Ministers know that their existence, as such, depends solely on the observance of non violence.
('72', 398, 1, 5, 738405) I hope that the released detenus will so act as to materially help the creation and consolidation of a non violent atmosphere, on which Mr. Subhas Chandra Bose has justly laid stress in his message on the eve of his departure for Europe for his health.
('72', 398, 1, 6, 738658) I hope that the released detenus will be no party to any public demonstration on their behalf and that the public, too, will exercise necessary restraint.
('72', 398, 1, 7, 738813) I would urge the released men to quietly undertake some public service.
('72', 398, 1, 8, 738885) The great business houses will, I doubt not, help those who may be in need of employment.
('72', 398, 1, 9, 738975) Most of the men I met in the jails of Calcutta told me that their sole object in desiring release was to serve the public cause in the manner indicated by the Congress.
('72', 398, 1, 10, 739144) They, one and all, warned me against entering into any bargain with the Government for securing their discharge.
('72', 398, 1, 11, 739257) They would not give any undertaking to the Government.
('72', 398, 1, 12, 739312) The assurance given by them to me should, they said, be regarded as sufficient test of their bona fides.
('72', 398, 1, 13, 739417) I told them that I would not be guilty of selling their honour or self respect for the purchase of their liberty.
('72', 398, 1, 14, 739531) The public will recall that, at the very outset of my negotiations, I ascertained from the Andamans prisoners whether I could work on the assumption of their renunciation of violent methods for the attainment of independence.
('72', 398, 1, 15, 739757) 1 I could not see my way to asking for relief without the ability to give such an assurance, 2 provided of course, that it represented the correct mentality of the prisoners.
('72', 398, 1, 16, 739932) I was not able to finish my work in Bengal.
('72', 398, 1, 17, 739976) It was not possible for me to do more during my time there.
('72', 398, 1, 18, 740036) I am grateful to the Government of Bengal for the facilities they gave me to see the prisoners and detenus as often as I liked without the presence there of officials.
('72', 398, 1, 19, 740204) My talks are not yet finished.
('72', 398, 1, 20, 740235) My Hijli (jail) friends wanted to have two or three days’ talk with me instead of the two hours only which I was able to give them; but then, they saw from my face that I

('72', 399, 0, 1, 740503) 400 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 399, 1, 2, 740545) was ill able to bear the strain of animated discussions.
('72', 399, 1, 3, 740602) They were most considerate to me.
('72', 399, 1, 4, 740636) I knew that I took them at a disadvantage for they could not talk to me with the freedom they would have, had I been well.
('72', 399, 1, 5, 740759) I hope, as soon as my health permits me, to go back to Bengal to see each one of the unreleased detenus and prisoners.
('72', 399, 1, 6, 740878) The communique is silent on the question of the Andamans prisoners.
('72', 399, 1, 7, 740946) I know that the Government draw a broad distinction between convicted prisoners and persons detained without trial.
('72', 399, 1, 8, 741062) The distinction is right.
('72', 399, 1, 9, 741088) There are undoubtedly difficulties in the way.
('72', 399, 1, 10, 741135) But at this stage I can only say that I have every hope, if all goes well and the public—especially the Bengal public—continues to help me as it has done hitherto, to secure these men’s discharge also.
('72', 399, 1, 11, 741337) One statement in the communique is disturbing.
('72', 399, 1, 12, 741384) It says that the success of the Government’s policy “must, however, depend on the co operation of the public and the leaders of public opinion in maintaining an atmosphere in which subversive movements will find no encouragement.” If by “subversive movements” they mean only violent activities, no difficulty arises and no difference of opinion exists.
('72', 399, 1, 13, 741737) But, if in the phrase they include non violent activities such as the Congress stands for, including even civil disobedience, the releases already made are a mistake and further releases will become an impossibility.
('72', 399, 1, 14, 741954) Throughout my conversations with the Ministers I made it quite plain that I could only help in maintaining non violence.
('72', 399, 1, 15, 742075) Non violence is the only proper and honourable common ground between the Government and the people.
('72', 399, 1, 16, 742175) Democracy must remain a dream in India without that bed rock.
('72', 399, 1, 17, 742237) I hope and believe that by “subversive movements” the Government mean no more than activities which are either themselves violent or which are intended to further violence.

('72', 400, 3, 5, 742593) I cannot overtake my correspondence in time.
('72', 400, 3, 6, 742638) Your love I treasure, of your hate, I know nothing.
('72', 400, 3, 7, 742690) But even if I had known it, I would not have minded it.
('72', 400, 3, 8, 742746) How could one help acting according to one’s nature?
('72', 400, 3, 9, 742799) ‘In Christ’ and ‘in God’ have for years been convertible terms for me.
('72', 400, 3, 10, 742870) I may not, probably will not, take the word in the same sense as most Christians do.
('72', 400, 3, 11, 742955) But that matters little.

('72', 401, 1, 3, 743998) At present my worries have increased and Sushila is completely upset.
('72', 401, 1, 4, 744068) You have shouted down your mother and your brother, crushed your sister, shouted down Ba yesterday and didn’t spare me, either, when leaving.
('72', 401, 1, 5, 744210) Do you realize all this?
('72', 401, 1, 6, 744235) Do you remember what you said?
('72', 401, 1, 7, 744266) If I let you go, you said, you would probably not be able to bear the separation and would return and lay your head in my lap.
('72', 401, 1, 8, 744393) Hasn’t that time come?
('72', 401, 1, 9, 744416) Don’t you feel these two days of separation as if they were two years?
('72', 401, 1, 10, 744487) If you feel so, come back in response to this letter and send a wire.
('72', 401, 1, 11, 744557) Only then can Sushila serve me and I can accept her services.
('72', 401, 1, 12, 744619) Do you know that I would consent even to your dreadful step if I could understand your arguments?
('72', 401, 1, 13, 744717) Won’t you wait till I have recovered or till I am dead?
('72', 401, 1, 14, 744773) I will seize the first opportunity to discuss the matter with you if I recover from this illness.
('72', 401, 1, 15, 744871) If you say that now there is nothing to be discussed, it will be like branding a man who has already sustained burns.
('72', 401, 1, 16, 744989) Your letter to Ramdas after the death of Chhotelal was not pro per.
('72', 401, 1, 17, 745057) It was unjust.
('72', 401, 1, 18, 745072) You did not have the patience to read Kishorelal’s letter.
('72', 401, 1, 19, 745131) You have done him a terrible injustice.
('72', 401, 1, 20, 745171) You failed in your duty by only reading the introductory part and leaving the rest of the material.
('72', 401, 1, 21, 745271) Even if the whole world fails to understand you and does you injustice, your dharma is to bear it.
('72', 401, 1, 22, 745370) “My honour is in your hands, O Lord, protect it.” If you take the unworthy step, you will darken my life for ever.

('72', 402, 10, 17, 746306) SEGAON, WARDHA, November 27, 1937 One can at once perceive in Acharya Kripalani’s way of thinking and writing a quality of uniqueness.
('72', 402, 10, 18, 746441) Anyone who has known him will recognize at once any piece of writing as his and his alone.
('72', 402, 10, 19, 746532) This is the impression I had while reading this collection.
('72', 402, 10, 20, 746592) At a time when all kinds of new ideas are spreading in the country, this collection is likely to be of considerable help to those who want to study them.
('72', 402, 10, 21, 746746) Acharya Kripalani has shown very convincingly that the programme the Congress adopted in 1920 is as useful now for attaining freedom as it was in 1920.
('72', 402, 11, 22, 746898) 1 This is a postscript to Mirabehn’s letter to the addressee.

('72', 403, 1, 2, 747033) Acharya Kripalani is quite correct in saying that there is no such thing as Gandhism.
('72', 403, 1, 3, 747119) Insistence on truth is an eternal principle.
('72', 403, 1, 4, 747164) While contemplating on it the jewel of non violence was discovered and as a result of the experiments in non violence emerged the programme of 1920. Trying to attain independence without it is as good as pounding chaff.

('72', 403, 4, 11, 747715) Your confidence in me flatters me, but if it is not extended to those through whom alone I can hope to work with success, the work for which you and I are striving comes to a standstill.
('72', 403, 4, 12, 747902) I have no power over the detenus or the Bengal public save through the accredited leaders.
('72', 403, 4, 13, 747993) I can impose nothing on them.
('72', 403, 4, 14, 748023) I have no other method but that of persuasion.
('72', 403, 4, 15, 748070) I am in constant correspondence with Shri Sarat Bose in this matter.
('72', 403, 4, 16, 748139) Without the assistance of the two brothers, I could have done nothing in Bengal.
('72', 403, 4, 17, 748220) Of course you were right in permitting .
('72', 403, 4, 18, 748261) Bidhan Chandra Roy and Sarojini Devi to visit the Hijli friends.
('72', 403, 4, 19, 748326) Their visit will help.
('72', 403, 4, 20, 748349) I may make one thing clear.
('72', 403, 4, 21, 748377) Any recommendation I may make will be, in so far as the Bengal Government are concerned, on my sole responsibility.
('72', 403, 4, 22, 748493) I hope therefore that you will please reconsider your decision and allow Shri Sarat Bose on my behalf to visit the Hijli prisoners for the time being.

('72', 405, 2, 4, 749930) Powdered or condensed milk must be available in India.

('72', 405, 2, 11, 750316) Is it not possible to dry the milk into powder?
('72', 405, 2, 12, 750364) If we think it our duty to insist on cow’s milk, the milk powder available outside at a cheaper rate can also be used.
('72', 405, 2, 13, 750483) These are, of course, only my suggestions.

('72', 406, 12, 20, 752291) I am accustomed to cold, and to sleeping under the sky in the severest weather.
('72', 406, 12, 21, 752371) But if the doctor 6 insists that the cold is having a detrimental effect on the heart and hence on the blood pressure, I should listen to what he says, if only to avoid the charge of obstinacy.

('72', 410, 8, 15, 757719) BHANSALI, How can we speak of killing two birds with one stone?
('72', 410, 8, 16, 757783) We may say that we bring down two fruits with one stone.
('72', 410, 8, 17, 757840) You may bring down with one stone as many fruits as you like, but don’t keep awake for long hours at the cost of sleep.
('72', 410, 8, 18, 757960) True yoga is that which strengthens body, mind and soul, all the three.
('72', 410, 8, 19, 758032) What you say about Sharda is correct.
('72', 410, 8, 20, 758070) She is a wise girl.
('72', 410, 8, 21, 758090) Give her as much as you can.
('72', 410, 8, 22, 758119) I am improving.

('72', 411, 2, 3, 758315) December 15, 1937
('72', 411, 3, 4, 758333) CHI SHARDA, Got your letter.
('72', 411, 3, 5, 758362) I do not wish to play a trick on you by arranging classes for you.
('72', 411, 3, 6, 758429) And is that possible in any case?
('72', 411, 3, 7, 758463) Are you such a simple soul that you can be so easily caught?
('72', 411, 3, 8, 758524) You have to do one thing.
('72', 411, 3, 9, 758550) You must make your body strong as steel.
('72', 411, 3, 10, 758591) Looking after the rest is my responsibility.
('72', 411, 3, 11, 758636) If you have followed everything about Dinshawji’s [treatment], start it.
('72', 411, 3, 12, 758709) It would not take as much time as you fear.
('72', 411, 3, 13, 758753) But spare whatever time may be necessary for it.
('72', 411, 3, 14, 758802) Write to me regularly about the result.
('72', 411, 3, 15, 758842) Why do you find the atmosphere dull?
('72', 411, 3, 16, 758879) Why should your mind be sad?
('72', 411, 3, 17, 758908) It is your own fault.
('72', 411, 3, 18, 758930) So many people, the cows and calves, the birds and bees, the shrubs and trees—one would be in blithe spirits with so much of company.
('72', 411, 3, 19, 759064) They are all your kith and kin—even the trees.

('72', 412, 3, 4, 759662) BAPA, How can you afford to give way to despair like this?
('72', 412, 3, 5, 759721) I had told you that even after we got complete independence, we should expect little help from the Government.
('72', 412, 3, 6, 759832) Should we expect the Government or God to do what ought to be done by every caste Hindu, or, rather, should not every individual do his own duty?
('72', 412, 3, 7, 759978) All the same, we shall see about the U. P. and Bihar.
('72', 412, 3, 8, 760032) 1 But we shall deserve no credit if we get help from there.
('72', 412, 3, 9, 760092) We can earn merit only by getting whatever every caste Hindu can give.
('72', 412, 3, 10, 760163) I hope, therefore, that you will not slacken your labours in future.
('72', 412, 3, 11, 760232) You have selected your sphere of service for your whole life.
('72', 412, 3, 12, 760294) Poona is definitely not for you.
('72', 412, 3, 13, 760327) You may certainly pay a visit to it every June.
('72', 412, 3, 14, 760375) Let Ghanshyamdas say what he likes, but the Sangh cannot be wound up.
('72', 412, 3, 15, 760445) 2 I am writing this from my sick bed.

('72', 412, 7, 22, 760660) This is your duty for the present.
('72', 412, 7, 23, 760695) Even if, therefore, you must go somewhere, you should postpone doing so.
('72', 412, 7, 24, 760768) But in future also do only what is within your capacity.
('72', 412, 7, 25, 760825) We may wish to do a good many things, but if we don’t have that much strength we should give in.
('72', 412, 7, 26, 760922) I am doing fairly well.

('72', 413, 7, 13, 761854) Don’t believe the newspapers.
('72', 413, 7, 14, 761884) If there is anything serious, you will no doubt get a cable from here.
('72', 413, 7, 15, 761955) What Sushila says is correct.
('72', 413, 7, 16, 761985) You needn’t thank her for any help she may give.
('72', 413, 7, 17, 762034) It would be strange if she did not help.
('72', 413, 7, 18, 762075) We used to sing a bhajan in Phoenix, one line in which ran: “A true lover’s love is that which expects no thanks or return for courtesy shown”.
('72', 413, 7, 19, 762219) “Vinayni purni” means “thanks or return”.

('72', 414, 3, 4, 762534) VIJAYA, You did well in coming back to Segaon on falling ill.
('72', 414, 3, 5, 762596) But why did you at all fall ill after leaving Segaon?
('72', 414, 3, 6, 762650) You must find this out.
('72', 414, 3, 7, 762674) If you can’t find the cause, you will be unfit to stay outside Segaon.
('72', 414, 3, 8, 762745) What will you learn from Vinoba’s words?
('72', 414, 3, 9, 762786) What you learned from his work is what matters.
('72', 414, 3, 10, 762834) If one could learn from words, wouldn’t I have sent you to some great scholar?
('72', 414, 3, 11, 762913) After you have recovered, go to Nalwadi, finish the work there soon and come back.
('72', 414, 3, 12, 762996) Master the art of spinning on the takli and the spinning wheel with good speed.
('72', 414, 3, 13, 763076) Master carding, too.
('72', 414, 3, 14, 763097) Why should you get tired out in eight hours?
('72', 414, 3, 15, 763142) Have you grown old?
('72', 414, 3, 16, 763162) Why should you get tired if you sit upright when spinning?
('72', 414, 3, 17, 763221) The Gita verses are recited there with the purest pronunciation of the words.
('72', 414, 3, 18, 763299) Probably you don’t hear them recited.
('72', 414, 3, 19, 763337) I suppose they recite the Marathi Geetai 1 there.

('72', 414, 8, 24, 763550) BHANSALI, There is no doubt at all that in turning to the path of karma you have done the best thing possible.
('72', 414, 8, 25, 763661) There is no other path at all while we live in the body.
('72', 414, 8, 26, 763718) We shall be free only if we surrender everything to Lord Krishna.
('72', 414, 8, 27, 763784) He who clings to Karma is attached to pleasure.
('72', 414, 8, 28, 763832) He is the true yogi who goes on doing his work as a duty laid on him and as sacrifice, i.
('72', 414, 8, 29, 763922) e., for the good of others, and remains unconcerned with the fruits of his work.
('72', 414, 8, 30, 764003) You may by all means go to Nalwadi for a few days .

('72', 415, 5, 6, 764522) December 21, 1937 I have your letter.
('72', 415, 5, 7, 764560) Don’t believe newspaper reports unless you get a cable from me.
('72', 415, 5, 8, 764624) If there is anything serious a cable will of course be sent.
('72', 415, 5, 9, 764685) What you think about me is not correct.
('72', 415, 5, 10, 764725) I believe that I am more vigilant than any other leader.
('72', 415, 5, 11, 764782) This is, as I understand, the straight and simple cause of my blood pressure.
('72', 415, 5, 12, 764860) My non attachment is less than what is meant by the Gita; I am full of feeling.
('72', 415, 5, 13, 764940) I am always pained by anybody’s suffering.
('72', 415, 5, 14, 764983) This is as it ought to be.
('72', 415, 5, 15, 765010) And still I must remain non attached.
('72', 415, 5, 16, 765048) I have not yet mastered that art.
('72', 415, 5, 17, 765082) It will not be non attachment if I am not affected by others’ sufferings.
('72', 415, 5, 18, 765156) The Gita asks us to endure cold and heat, joy and sorrow.
('72', 415, 5, 19, 765214) It doesn’t say [in so many words] that a non attached person never feels them.
('72', 415, 5, 20, 765293) If, therefore, you said to me, ‘Bapu, you are not obeying the teaching of Mother Gita’, your charge would be tenable.
('72', 415, 5, 21, 765411) But, as for physical rest, such as the pampering of the body, etc., I have been taking more than enough.
('72', 415, 5, 22, 765516) Know that my coming to Juhu is nothing but pampering.
('72', 415, 5, 23, 765570) There are so many things to be done but I have forsaken them.
('72', 415, 5, 24, 765632) My reasoning is clear, but I am not exercising it.
('72', 415, 5, 25, 765683) You should, therefore, stop worrying about me.
('72', 415, 6, 26, 765730) If this is done, you two will be able to pay frequent visits here by turns.
('72', 415, 6, 27, 765806) But the condition is that your health must become fine.
('72', 415, 6, 28, 765862) You can collect the bills, can do composing and can even write something.
('72', 415, 6, 29, 765936) One learns to do a thing by doing it.
('72', 415, 6, 30, 765974) Nimu also will get useful experience there and can help in the work a great deal.
('72', 415, 6, 31, 766056) Kanam is happy.
('72', 415, 6, 32, 766072) You will read about all that in Ba’s letter.

('72', 416, 4, 8, 766512) Who is with you?
('72', 416, 4, 9, 766529) Most probably Jamnalalji will be in Nagpur on 26th.
('72', 416, 4, 10, 766581) I have no doubt you will invite him.
('72', 416, 4, 11, 766618) Anyway ask him whether you could come for a few days to Juhu and if he says yes, and if you have not tied yourself down otherwise, do come.
('72', 416, 4, 12, 766758) I am expecting a full letter from you in reply to mine.

('72', 417, 8, 21, 768404) PRABHA, You seem to be quite a cunning woman.
('72', 417, 8, 22, 768450) What excuses you offer for not writing!
('72', 417, 8, 23, 768490) You are like a thief turning round and accusing the police.
('72', 417, 8, 24, 768550) You went on your own, and now say that you had to leave and, therefore, feel no inclination to write.
('72', 417, 8, 25, 768652) You had definitely promised me that you would write.
('72', 417, 8, 26, 768705) You went alone.
('72', 417, 8, 27, 768721) And even then no letter saying that you had arrived safe!
('72', 417, 8, 28, 768779) And even if you don’t care about me, what about poor Amtul Salaam?
('72', 417, 8, 29, 768846) She inquires every day whether there has been a letter from you.
('72', 417, 8, 30, 768911) She writes to you almost daily and you don’t write even a few lines on a slip of paper in reply!
('72', 417, 8, 31, 769008) What discourtesy?
('72', 417, 8, 32, 769026) And what hard heartedness!
('72', 417, 8, 33, 769053) Tell me now what punishment you deserve, and in what measure.
('72', 417, 8, 34, 769115) What do you do about milk there?
('72', 417, 8, 35, 769148) You did well in going away, of course.
('72', 417, 8, 36, 769187) About myself Amtul Salaam will write.

('72', 418, 6, 8, 769647) Can you give me a better diminutive?
('72', 418, 6, 9, 769684) I did not know till after I had written to you that you had already been shut out.
('72', 418, 6, 10, 769767) So you are now taking your revenge at my expense.
('72', 418, 6, 11, 769817) But I understand.
('72', 418, 6, 12, 769835) You shall certainly come later.

('72', 418, 6, 14, 769941) You wouldn’t be an idiot, if you had answered my questions about your health.
('72', 418, 6, 15, 770019) Now you must when you write again.
('72', 418, 6, 16, 770054) You will be interested to read the two cuttings herewith.
('72', 418, 6, 17, 770112) Perhaps you had not seen them before.

('72', 418, 11, 24, 770388) I am getting on as well as may be.
('72', 418, 11, 25, 770423) And whatever I do and do not do, I suppose I shall live on for a while, if God wants more work from me.
('72', 418, 11, 26, 770527) His work goes on, we come in only when and to the extent He wants us.

('72', 419, 6, 11, 771155) It is surprising that spinning on the takli tires you out.
('72', 419, 6, 12, 771214) Build up your strength so much and so well that you will not get fatigued no matter how long you spin.
('72', 419, 6, 13, 771317) Find out the reason why you get fatigued.
('72', 419, 6, 14, 771359) See that you don’t fall ill again.
('72', 419, 6, 15, 771394) Kanu and others will write about me.
('72', 419, 6, 16, 771431) Ask Vinoba about yourself.

('72', 419, 11, 24, 771752) This bath consists of just lying in hot and cold water.
('72', 419, 11, 25, 771808) The effect of hot and cold [water] alone is important.
('72', 419, 11, 26, 771863) For this bath even small round tubs would do.
('72', 419, 11, 27, 771909) But these we do not have.
('72', 419, 11, 28, 771935) Have you understood it now?
('72', 419, 11, 29, 771963) It is proper to begin Dinshawji’s treatment only after fully understanding everything.
('72', 419, 11, 30, 772050) Do you find time to read?

('72', 421, 3, 6, 773146) It has only added to my anxiety and disturbed Sushila.

('72', 421, 3, 8, 773254) What a burden you have taken upon yourself!
('72', 421, 3, 9, 773298) I had only mentioned it in jest but the reality of it strikes me hard.
('72', 421, 3, 10, 773369) It is a tremendous task for you not to miss a single meeting.
('72', 421, 3, 11, 773431) Treat it as your obligation.

('72', 421, 8, 20, 773847) PROFESSOR: If we had in the world a people who practised ahimsa, could they keep themselves free from being slaves of others?
('72', 421, 9, 21, 773973) GANDHIJI: If one person can, surely a nation can.
('72', 421, 9, 22, 774023) No man or group of men can hold any other man or group of other men slaves against their will.
('72', 421, 9, 23, 774118) The slave driver will say ‘Do this’ and they will refuse.
('72', 421, 9, 24, 774176) It is possible to imagine that some day all nations will become sufficiently intelligent to act, even in the mass, as individuals do today.
('72', 421, 10, 25, 774316) Gandhiji then drew a vivid picture of the violent road for India, how she might murder and fight, and suffer reprisals, till out of 30 crores only one crore would be left.
('72', 421, 11, 26, 774488) 1 As placed in the source 2 This report by Mirabehn appeared under the title “The way of God or the Way of the Devil” with the following introductory note: “Readers of Harijan will like to share with me the following dialogue between Gandhiji and an Italian Professor which took place in Segaon in 1937. I found it in my notebook as I was turning over old papers.
('72', 421, 11, 27, 774852) It gives a fuller meaning to his Press message on the world situation.” Vide, “Statement to the Press”, On or before 27 8 1939.
('72', 422, 0, 1, 774980) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 423
('72', 422, 1, 2, 775024) But I decided that that was not the road for me.
('72', 422, 1, 3, 775073) I rehearsed all these things in my mind, but I said to myself, ‘This is the way of the Devil, not the way of God.’ The thought of those twenty nine crores of lives sacrificed would ever haunt me.
('72', 422, 1, 4, 775269) The fact of the one crore of giants, trained in violence, who would have the whole of India to spread themselves in, would give me no satisfaction.
('72', 422, 1, 5, 775417) I said to myself, ‘I must take the way of non violence, and take with me even the lepers and the lunatics.’ For, after all, are we not all more or less lepers and more or less mad?
('72', 422, 1, 6, 775598) If we were all sane, we should be like gods.
('72', 422, 1, 7, 775643) It is because we have a screw loose that we cannot succeed in being one with God.

('72', 422, 4, 11, 775801) The doctors wanted Gandhiji to continue the stay until the end of January, but a month out of Segaon was the most Gandhiji could give himself.
('72', 422, 4, 12, 775944) Not that he has regained a condition of health enabling him to resume his normal activities.
('72', 422, 4, 13, 776037) But as he put it to the doctors in his own unanswerable way: If I cannot get well out of Segaon, I should prefer to face death in Segaon in the process of giving there to the country the work I think I am specially gifted to give.

('72', 422, 7, 17, 776337) “But why should you put so much passion in all your talk?” said C. R. to Gandhiji on the last day of our stay at Juhu.
('72', 422, 7, 18, 776456) Laughing, Gandhiji said: Because I have yet to learn the lesson of the Gita to be passionless.
('72', 422, 7, 19, 776551) There is the desire to see that in whatever I am speaking about, to whomsoever I am speaking, truth—cent per cent truth—is speaking out.
('72', 422, 8, 20, 776688) [C. R.]But why can’t you forget all work until you are fully well?
('72', 422, 9, 21, 776755) 1 This and the following item are reproduced from Mahadev Desai’s “Notes”.
('72', 422, 9, 22, 776830) The conversation took place before Gandhiji left Juhu for Segaon on January 7, 1938.

('72', 423, 1, 3, 777036) One of them has become the question of the Andamans prisoners and the Bengal detenus.
('72', 423, 2, 4, 777122) [C. R.]Then why do you ask me to let others do their work and not to try to mind others’ portfolios?
('72', 423, 2, 5, 777223) All I say is that I have not acquired the art of controlling my swabhava.
('72', 423, 3, 6, 777297) [GANDHIJI:] Even so must I obey the law of my swabhava.
('72', 423, 4, 7, 777353) “But why must you devote precious hours to what seems to us to be unimportant people and things?” said another friend.
('72', 423, 4, 8, 777472) [GANDHIJI:] They seem to you to be unimportant, not to me.
('72', 423, 4, 9, 777531) For fifty years I have acted in the same way and I cannot change my spots now.

('72', 423, 7, 13, 777683) When asked whether he could stand the Segaon cold in his present delicate state of health, Gandhiji said in his clear silver voice that he was hopeful that Segaon would suit him.
('72', 423, 7, 14, 777862) Gandhiji admitted that his 32 days’ stay in Juhu had contributed much to his improvement.
('72', 423, 7, 15, 777952) Let me get back to Segaon and try that village.
('72', 423, 7, 16, 778000) If I go down again, I will return to Juhu.
('72', 423, 8, 17, 778043) Asked why he could not continue the stay in Juhu for a few more weeks, instead of running a risk in Segaon, the Mahatma nodded his head, raised his hands and said: Let me see what God has in store for me.
('72', 423, 9, 18, 778248) Mahatma Gandhi had a word of appreciation for the Press who had co operated with him in carrying out the doctors’ instruction regarding complete rest.
('72', 423, 10, 19, 778399) Asked to give a message about the Bengal detenus, Mahatma Gandhi said: No messages, please.

('72', 424, 3, 5, 778712) Only I rarely write nowadays.

('72', 424, 3, 17, 779386) The temperature is 60 64 during night, 72 76 during day.
('72', 424, 3, 18, 779443) You ought to keep well by treating yourself along the lines of naturopathy.
('72', 424, 3, 19, 779519) I do wish you could have come earlier.
('72', 424, 3, 20, 779558) However, one has to be thankful for small mercies.
('72', 424, 3, 21, 779609) But do try to come earlier, if it is at all possible.
('72', 424, 3, 22, 779663) Did I tell you that last year’s shawl you gave me has gone to Ba at her own instance.
('72', 424, 3, 23, 779749) I know you don’t mind that.

('72', 424, 8, 29, 779916) “But you now know that you cannot put up with more than a certain amount of strain.
('72', 424, 8, 30, 780000) Why should you invite that strain and let all the people feel that Segaon does not suit you?” said Jamnalalji, on Sunday, the day after our return to Segaon.
('72', 424, 8, 31, 780158) [GANDHIJI:] It would be wrong to say so.
('72', 424, 8, 32, 780199) All I want you to do is to co operate with me when I say to everyone that I must mend or end in Segaon and not go out anywhere else, that no outside doctors should be troubled to come here.

('72', 425, 1, 2, 780522) But you have often assured us that you are making a conscious effort to live.
('72', 425, 1, 3, 780600) I have.
('72', 425, 1, 4, 780608) But if someone were to tell me, in order to avoid death, to retire to the Himalayas until the end of this year, I should not do so.
('72', 425, 1, 5, 780740) For I know that death is inevitable, no matter what precautions man deludes himself with.
('72', 425, 1, 6, 780830) I would like you to appreciate that I am one of the very few among the public men in India who know how to preserve their health.
('72', 425, 1, 7, 780960) God knows what work to take out of me.
('72', 425, 1, 8, 780999) He will not permit me to live a moment longer than He needs me for His work.

('72', 425, 8, 20, 781330) SEGAON, January 10, 1938
('72', 425, 9, 21, 781355) KANTI, Your letters are lying with me.
('72', 425, 9, 22, 781394) I have read all of them carefully and with interest, for I was waiting for them practically every day.
('72', 425, 9, 23, 781497) I wanted to write to you even before I received your first letter, but I was held back because I was afraid of you.
('72', 425, 9, 24, 781613) The fear was that you, who were already angry with me, might get more so if I [inadvertently] wrote something which you didn’t like.
('72', 425, 9, 25, 781746) Despite this fear, however, I would have decided and summoned up courage to write were it not for my illness.
('72', 425, 9, 26, 781856) I was happy to see no sign of anger in your letters.
('72', 425, 9, 27, 781909) But I do believe that it was because of anger that you had abruptly discontinued writing to me.
('72', 425, 9, 28, 782005) However, as is your wont, after some reflection you overcame your anger and started writing to me as before.
('72', 425, 9, 29, 782114) Your letters are to me, what the rain is to the chataka 1. In fact, I have never given up hope of you.
('72', 425, 9, 30, 782217) I am sure that, before I die, you

('72', 426, 1, 2, 782348) will again become one with me as you were before.
('72', 426, 1, 3, 782398) This certainly doesn’t mean that I want you to give up your study and run up to me.
('72', 426, 1, 4, 782482) Do complete your study.
('72', 426, 1, 5, 782506) You did well in visiting Trivandrum.
('72', 426, 1, 6, 782543) Saraswati was longing for you.
('72', 426, 1, 7, 782574) You may come here only when you conveniently can.
('72', 426, 1, 8, 782624) The discussion with the teacher was very fine.
('72', 426, 1, 9, 782671) You certainly have the power of reasoning.
('72', 426, 1, 10, 782714) What about Tamil, Malayalam and Kannada?
('72', 426, 1, 11, 782755) It will be quite easy for you to learn these languages.
('72', 426, 1, 12, 782811) Amala knows thirteen languages and can even teach some of them.
('72', 426, 1, 13, 782875) Max Mueller knew fourteen languages including Latin, Greek, Hebrew and Sanskrit.
('72', 426, 1, 14, 782956) He could even correspond in Sanskrit.
('72', 426, 1, 15, 782994) We, on the other hand, try to learn everything through English in order to master that language and as a result get exhausted and become incapable of doing anything else.
('72', 426, 1, 16, 783165) In itself, knowledge of several languages is as useful as it is interesting and easy to acquire.
('72', 426, 1, 17, 783262) I hope you are taking care of your health.
('72', 426, 1, 18, 783305) I am still not permitted to write letters.
('72', 426, 1, 19, 783348) I think this is the first long letter Ihave written after I fell ill.
('72', 426, 1, 20, 783418) Mahadev will correct me if I am making a mistake in this.
('72', 426, 1, 21, 783476) I am gradually improving.
('72', 426, 1, 22, 783502) I do hope to recover completely.
('72', 426, 1, 23, 783535) The only medicine is rest, and I am taking as much of it as I can.
('72', 426, 1, 24, 783602) Write to Devdas, as also to Manilal and Ramdas.

('72', 426, 3, 30, 783870) Your reply is no reply.
('72', 426, 3, 31, 783894) Is not the article in Hindi?
('72', 426, 3, 32, 783923) Your reply also should be in Hindi.
('72', 426, 3, 33, 783959) The manner of replying should be different, too.
('72', 426, 3, 34, 784008) There is no hurry about it.
('72', 426, 3, 35, 784036) We will think it over when we meet.

('72', 427, 2, 4, 784456) There is One who worries for you, me, and everybody.
('72', 427, 2, 5, 784509) Why, then, should we worry at all?
('72', 427, 2, 6, 784544) And now I am improving, even though slowly.
('72', 427, 2, 7, 784588) Do not trust the newspapers—except If you can live there peacefully, your health will improve even there.
('72', 427, 2, 8, 784694) In any case, however, you will be able to earn a plain loaf of bread anywhere.
('72', 427, 2, 9, 784773) If you become calm you will improve your health even there.
('72', 427, 2, 10, 784833) Here you would feel embarrassed to eat as much as you wish while there everybody does and can do so.
('72', 427, 2, 11, 784934) Such is the power of psychological atmosphere.
('72', 427, 2, 12, 784981) How can one eat one’s fill without a sense of guilt in this poverty stricken country?
('72', 427, 2, 13, 785067) There you are far away.
('72', 427, 2, 14, 785091) In a distant land one should forget things back home and adjust oneself to the surrounding atmosphere.
('72', 427, 2, 15, 785194) I have not come across any human being who remains unaffected by his surroundings.
('72', 427, 2, 16, 785277) I for one think there can be no such person.
('72', 427, 2, 17, 785322) If there is any such person in a million, he must be a vatapi, that is, one who lives only on air.
('72', 427, 2, 18, 785421) How can such a one permit himself to eat anything else?
('72', 427, 2, 19, 785477) Does God eat?
('72', 427, 2, 20, 785491) With what mouth and with what body can He eat?
('72', 427, 2, 21, 785538) I will write no more, otherwise the doctors will complain.
('72', 427, 2, 22, 785597) Do not be anxious about Nimu and Kanam.
('72', 427, 2, 23, 785637) Please have faith that everything possible is being done for everyone.
('72', 427, 2, 24, 785708) If more is possible, I would certainly do it.
('72', 427, 2, 25, 785754) But if we attempt anything beyond our capacity, we might violate our dharma and break under the strain.

('72', 428, 7, 17, 786918) SEGAON, January 13, 1938 1. Even if Nanabhai himself wishes to leave, I should like to know why.
('72', 428, 7, 18, 787015) I would never agree to his leaving.
('72', 428, 7, 19, 787051) What he has is something permanent.
('72', 428, 7, 20, 787087) Why should he run after what is impermanent?
('72', 428, 7, 21, 787132) 2. I have no doubts even about you.
('72', 428, 7, 22, 787168) 3 You also cannot leave.
('72', 428, 7, 23, 787193) I would study even that point 4 from every possible angle.
('72', 428, 7, 24, 787252) Even if you were to devote all the 24 hours to the Harijan Ashram, there is so much work that every day there would be something left to be done.
('72', 428, 7, 25, 787398) However, if you can do other work while looking after the Harijan Ashram, well and good.
('72', 428, 7, 26, 787487) But as the author of this scheme of education I feel that you can experiment with it and develop it among the boys you have in the Harijan Ashram.
('72', 428, 7, 27, 787634) I would prefer that.
('72', 428, 8, 28, 787655) 3. What about your remark that we should regard this work as our own?
('72', 428, 8, 29, 787725) I have not been able to think about it even after perusing the

('72', 428, 9, 31, 787991) 3 This was addressed to Narahari D. Parikh.
('72', 428, 9, 32, 788035) 4 About running the school while remaining in the Ashram
('72', 429, 0, 1, 788092) 430 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 429, 1, 2, 788134) papers you sent to me.
('72', 429, 1, 3, 788157) We do not have sufficient equipment for that purpose.
('72', 429, 1, 4, 788211) But I think that Maganbhai 1 should throw some light on the subject if he can.
('72', 429, 1, 5, 788290) I do not think that we should do something anyhow even if we do not find the equipment we want.
('72', 429, 1, 6, 788386) Let us avail ourselves of whatever our stray attempts may yield.
('72', 429, 1, 7, 788451) We would be deceiving ourselves by attempting anything else.
('72', 429, 1, 8, 788512) Had it not been for Zakir Husain and [Arya]nayakam, I would have abandoned the implementation of my idea of education.
('72', 429, 1, 9, 788631) That is in my very nature.
('72', 429, 2, 10, 788658) 4. Atitkar has volunteered to start the work in Maharashtra.
('72', 429, 2, 11, 788719) I cannot say how much he would be able to do.
('72', 429, 2, 12, 788765) But he has shown the courage and offered to do something.
('72', 429, 2, 13, 788823) Would it look proper if we were not able to do anything in Gujarat?
('72', 429, 2, 14, 788891) The Government wants us to manage even the Basic Training College.
('72', 429, 2, 15, 788958) I have realized that.
('72', 429, 2, 16, 788980) I would certainly feel ashamed if we did not show the courage and take up the challenge.
('72', 429, 2, 17, 789069) But it would be disgraceful if we were able to do nothing after taking up the challenge.
('72', 429, 2, 18, 789158) Hence, it seems to me that if, after careful consideration we cannot find someone who has self confidence and who would also inspire confidence in us, we should keep quiet.
('72', 429, 2, 19, 789331) Can we not take somebody from Balubhai’s circle?
('72', 429, 2, 20, 789380) What does Maganbhai say?
('72', 429, 3, 21, 789405) 5. Maganbhai says that we should train some of the Visharad candidates in the Vidyapith as teachers.
('72', 429, 3, 22, 789506) Then let us do that.
('72', 429, 3, 23, 789527) Let the Premchand Shala 2 continue to function as it is functioning now.
('72', 429, 3, 24, 789600) Let the Government recognize and also finance the experiment in the Vidyapith.
('72', 429, 4, 25, 789679) 6. When the matter of expenditure was first mentioned to the Sardar he had said that he would manage about the expenses.
('72', 429, 4, 26, 789800) He was not in favour of asking financial help from the Government.
('72', 429, 4, 27, 789867) That would be my view too.
('72', 429, 4, 28, 789894) But the position is this.
('72', 429, 4, 29, 789920) The Government is keen to do something and wants to involve the officials in it.
('72', 429, 4, 30, 790001) Since the Congress has recommended this experiment, every Congress Government must do something about it.
('72', 429, 4, 31, 790107) Considering the matter from this point of view, how can we go to the Sardar for help?
('72', 429, 4, 32, 790193) The answer was provided by Maganbhai.
('72', 429, 4, 33, 790231) If Maganbhai and others feel more confident, let them proceed.
('72', 429, 4, 34, 790294) Otherwise let us not utilize Government funds.
('72', 429, 4, 35, 790341) Since it would run as a Government institution, we

('72', 430, 1, 2, 790516) would have Government teachers.
('72', 430, 1, 3, 790548) And though we should enjoy many facilities, we would not be tied by the Government’s red tape, because the Government would put no restrictions on us.
('72', 430, 2, 4, 790699) 7. What should we do about the principle of non co operation?
('72', 430, 2, 5, 790761) Would it be proper to pass a resolution that it should be suspended so long as the Congress Governments are in power?
('72', 430, 2, 6, 790879) I think it would be wrong to pass such a resolution.
('72', 430, 2, 7, 790932) So we shall not suspend it.
('72', 430, 2, 8, 790960) But if we still regard it as British rule, then it is the Government that is co operating with us and not we who are co operating with the Government.
('72', 430, 2, 9, 791111) In other words, we can co operate with the Government without modifying the resolution in any way.
('72', 430, 2, 10, 791210) I had myself drafted that resolution 1 without any hesitation.
('72', 430, 2, 11, 791273) Even then I had said that if the Government offered its co operation to us, we should accept it.
('72', 430, 2, 12, 791370) Maybe that might prove a test for us.
('72', 430, 2, 13, 791408) It remains to be seen whether thereby we gain or lose strength.
('72', 430, 2, 14, 791472) At the height of the non co operation movement I had told Lord Reading that if he was agreeable to certain conditions I would myself enter the Legislature and yet consider myself a non co operator.
('72', 430, 2, 15, 791670) I had said the same thing in my letter 2 to Lord Irwin.
('72', 430, 2, 16, 791726) But this time such a question does not arise.
('72', 430, 2, 17, 791772) To look at the matter that way is looseness of thinking or wrong use of a term.
('72', 430, 2, 18, 791852) It is a result of our mental lethargy.
('72', 430, 2, 19, 791891) Has not the Congress Minister issued an order that the Collectors have to work in co operation with the Congressmen?
('72', 430, 3, 20, 792008) 8. What do you think of the suggestions of Maganbhai and Vithaldas?
('72', 430, 3, 21, 792076) I have not read the suggestions so carefully.
('72', 430, 3, 22, 792122) From a cursory glance l did not find them disconnected.
('72', 430, 3, 23, 792178) You have called them stray thoughts.
('72', 430, 3, 24, 792215) I too read them from that point of view.
('72', 430, 3, 25, 792256) I have no time at all to subject them to a deep critical study.
('72', 430, 4, 26, 792320) 9. Maganbhai suggests our joining the movement for Gujarat University and giving it greater impetus.
('72', 430, 4, 27, 792421) Wait a bit.
('72', 430, 4, 28, 792433) We have not started discussing that point.
('72', 430, 4, 29, 792476) I have not been able to understand Maganbhai’s views about the University.
('72', 430, 4, 30, 792551) In expressing his view about the matter Naraharibhai would seem to have usurped my own ideas and words.
('72', 430, 4, 31, 792655) And, if he likes praise, I should say that he has expressed my ideas in better language than I could have done myself.
('72', 430, 4, 32, 792774) The university of my conception has to evolve itself

('72', 431, 1, 2, 792965) from this type of education.
('72', 431, 1, 3, 792994) I went to the extent of telling Vallabhbhai that we must wind up whatever is being done in the Vidyapith today and engage all our teachers for this task.
('72', 431, 1, 4, 793148) Then alone would we do credit to ourselves and to the Vidyapith.
('72', 431, 1, 5, 793213) I think he was shocked at the moment.
('72', 431, 1, 6, 793251) But I could not persuade him to think further about it.
('72', 431, 1, 7, 793307) There were other things to be done.
('72', 431, 1, 8, 793343) But if I could convince the teachers, I would at once put my idea into practice.
('72', 431, 2, 9, 793424) 10. What should we do if we have to do something without winding up the present set up?
('72', 431, 2, 10, 793512) It would mean doing something under compulsion.
('72', 431, 2, 11, 793560) If Maganbhai has suggested any scheme I would think over it and make suggestions if necessary.
('72', 431, 2, 12, 793655) You, Kishorelalbhai, had pointed out that we were neglecting primary education.
('72', 431, 2, 13, 793735) Then we also passed a resolution.
('72', 431, 2, 14, 793769) We have never been able to implement that resolution fully.
('72', 431, 2, 15, 793829) We have an opportunity now, because it is our own Government and, moreover, such a good man as Kher is in charge.
('72', 431, 3, 16, 793943) 11. (About securing a charter for the Vidyapith.) I see a great danger in it.
('72', 431, 3, 17, 794021) For, such a step would invite intense jealousy.
('72', 431, 3, 18, 794069) It would also mean asking the Government to incur great expenditure.
('72', 431, 3, 19, 794138) I would not be interested in this, as it would mean diversion of funds to ourselves.
('72', 431, 3, 20, 794223) Our field is service of Daridra narayana.
('72', 431, 3, 21, 794265) In one way the task is difficult, in another it is easy.
('72', 431, 3, 22, 794322) However, I shall certainly not stand in the way.
('72', 431, 3, 23, 794371) Do I take any interest now in its management or do I meet anyone or know what is happening?
('72', 431, 3, 24, 794463) As for the Wardha Scheme, I may be said to be its author and so I must devote some of my time to it.
('72', 431, 3, 25, 794564) I do not consider myself of any importance in the matter of deciding the future of the Vidyapith.
('72', 431, 3, 26, 794662) My heart is at present wholly in the villages.
('72', 431, 3, 27, 794709) It is better to let it remain there.
('72', 431, 3, 28, 794746) If you seek my help in thinking about the Vidyapith, you will be inviting unnecessary knocks because I would only be throwing stones from a distance.
('72', 431, 4, 29, 794896) 12. Maganbhai says that at present the Gandhian view is accepted by the majority in the Congress but the general public opinion—particularly in the field of education—is against us.
('72', 431, 4, 30, 795078) Is it proper, under these circumstances, to take advantage of our majority?
('72', 431, 4, 31, 795154) This seems to me fundamental from the point of view of satyagraha.
('72', 431, 4, 32, 795221) The function of satyagraha is to educate public opinion.
('72', 431, 4, 33, 795278) It is difficult to say at any time whether public opinion is in favour of a satyagrahi.
('72', 431, 4, 34, 795366) So we give due importance to the question.
('72', 431, 4, 35, 795409) It seems

('72', 432, 1, 2, 795462) perfectly all right to me [to take such advantage] 1. For in so doing, we serve the people.
('72', 432, 1, 3, 795554) There is no coercion in it.
('72', 432, 1, 4, 795582) And if Maganbhai runs only a training college, then there is no difference of opinion left at all.
('72', 432, 1, 5, 795681) But in that case, should not other things be wound up?
('72', 432, 1, 6, 795736) It is my impression that Maganbhai does see the problem.
('72', 432, 2, 7, 795793) There would be very few—maybe only two or four—students in Maganbhai’s Training College.
('72', 432, 2, 8, 795882) Maganbhai does not seem to have a proper idea of a training college.
('72', 432, 2, 9, 795951) If he has the training college, he would require to do nothing else.
('72', 432, 2, 10, 796020) I wish all of you to thoroughly study what is happening here.
('72', 432, 2, 11, 796082) It is not perfect but it is worth studying.
('72', 432, 3, 12, 796126) 13. Gandhiji indicated by a sign his approval of the Harijan Ashram and the Vadaj School being merged into one and Naraharibhai conducting it on the lines of the Wardha Scheme.

('72', 432, 7, 16, 796487) I have no difficulty in appreciating their reasoning, but my plea for patience is based on a personal but peremptory cause.
('72', 432, 7, 17, 796611) If, going out of my way, I begin to move actively and undertake even long journeys, the common end may be defeated by my collapse which medical friends regard as a certainty.
('72', 432, 7, 18, 796786) Therefore, I appeal to the hunger strikers to suspend their strike and to give the country and especially me a chance to make an effort in the common direction.
('72', 432, 7, 19, 796947) Let it not be said of them that they were foolhardy or obstinate.

('72', 433, 2, 3, 797277) [Before January 15, 1938]
('72', 433, 3, 4, 797303) ZILLIACUS:] I had been wishing all these years that leaders of opinion ought to turn their attention to education which alone can reconstruct society, and I cannot tell you how grateful I was when I found that you had turned your attention to education.
('72', 433, 3, 5, 797557) We have studied your scheme and we must assure you of our heartfelt sympathy for its success.
('72', 433, 3, 6, 797651) [GANDHIJI:] I am grateful that so many educationists have blessed the scheme.
('72', 433, 3, 7, 797729) There have been critics also, but when I launched the scheme I did not know that it would appeal to anyone beyond the circle of my co workers.
('72', 433, 3, 8, 797872) When I consider the masses of India and the masses situated as they are, I could not think of any other type of education.
('72', 433, 3, 9, 797995) With them work must precede anything else, and the concern of the educationist is to make that work educative.
('72', 433, 3, 10, 798106) Let every child feel that he creates something for use and also expands his mind and heart therethrough.
('72', 433, 4, 11, 798211) I agree.
('72', 433, 4, 12, 798220) The great psychologist Dr. Adler, who could not express himself well in English, said: “All that education should do is to put the child on the useful side.”

('72', 433, 7, 15, 798421) [Before January 15, 1938]
('72', 433, 8, 16, 798447) [GANDHIJI:] My idea is not merely to teach a particular profession or occupation to the children, but to develop the full man through teaching that occupation.
('72', 433, 8, 17, 798607) He will not only learn weaving, for instance, but learn why he should weave in a particular fashion and not any other, why he should handle yarn in a particular fashion and no other, why he should himself know spinning and insist on a particular count for a particular kind of weaving.
('72', 433, 8, 18, 798893) All these things the weaver boy does not learn at home.
('72', 433, 8, 19, 798949) The spinning wheel is to him just what it was a thousand years ago.
('72', 433, 8, 20, 799017) We make him learn the art of making a most efficient wheel and a loom, not so as to displace other labour but so as to make them more efficient than the existing

('72', 433, 9, 22, 799202) Bovet and Prof.
('72', 433, 9, 23, 799218) Davies, members of the New Education Fellowship Delegation, had called on Gandhiji.

('72', 434, 1, 2, 799346) models.
('72', 434, 1, 3, 799354) Your suggestion for different schools for different classes— weavers, spinners, carpenters and so on—would not answer my purpose.
('72', 434, 1, 4, 799484) For I want to bring about an equalization of status.
('72', 434, 1, 5, 799537) The working classes have all these centuries been isolated and relegated to a lower status.
('72', 434, 1, 6, 799629) They have been Shudras, and the word has been interpreted to mean an inferior status.
('72', 434, 1, 7, 799715) I want to allow no differentiation between the sons of a weaver, of an agriculturist and of a schoolmaster.
('72', 434, 2, 8, 799823) [THE FRIEND:] But should we not have different time tables for different boys—I mean seasonal time tables?
('72', 434, 2, 9, 799930) No, we need not have even different hours.
('72', 434, 2, 10, 799973) The village is a composite whole.
('72', 434, 2, 11, 800007) The vast majority of the rural population is agricultural.
('72', 434, 2, 12, 800066) I need not conduct a separate type of school for the ten per cent of the non agricultural population in India.
('72', 434, 2, 13, 800177) I do not want to make every one of the boys and girls in the villages of India spinners or weavers, but I want to make of them whole men through whatever occupation they will learn.
('72', 434, 2, 14, 800359) The village school will be turned into an educative workshop in as economical and efficient a manner as possible.
('72', 434, 2, 15, 800473) Therefore the school will not be a glorified workshop producing more or less the conditions of the present day workshops.
('72', 434, 2, 16, 800595) The workshop will not teach the children to produce anything and everything of conceivable use.
('72', 434, 2, 17, 800691) Tobacco, for instance, is a commodity very largely in use throughout the world, it is cultivated in India as a money crop.
('72', 434, 2, 18, 800814) But its harm to man’s physical and moral fibre is patent.
('72', 434, 2, 19, 800872) I should not teach in our school workshop bidi making.
('72', 434, 2, 20, 800927) It is in this respect that our schools will, 1 hope, differ radically from schools abroad which claim to give a sort of practical education.
('72', 434, 2, 21, 801068) I read the other day about a school in England which trains boys to be efficient shop keepers.
('72', 434, 2, 22, 801163) England accepts no prohibition and does not look forward to its introduction in the near or distant future.
('72', 434, 2, 23, 801271) English boys, therefore, have to be trained as workers in liquor shops too.
('72', 434, 2, 24, 801347) The English school in question has, therefore, applied for a liquor licence in order to be able to teach its pupils how to handle liquor for its consumers.
('72', 434, 2, 25, 801503) In the event of a war England may turn its schools into ammunition factories.
('72', 434, 2, 26, 801581) In a nation with ahimsa for its national policy such a thing should be inconceivable.
('72', 434, 2, 27, 801667) Our schools will be turned into workshops, but workshops where they will learn things that are necessary for healthy living in accordance with the national ideal.

('72', 436, 2, 3, 802973) [January 20, 1938] 2
('72', 436, 3, 4, 802994) During his talk on the last day Lord Lothian mentioned Christian Science and asked for Gandhiji’s opinion thereon:
('72', 436, 4, 5, 803109) Since man is inseparably related to God in proportion as he recognizes the indissoluble relationship to God he is free from sin and from disease.
('72', 436, 4, 6, 803255) That is how faith heals.
('72', 436, 4, 7, 803280) God is Truth and Health and Love.
('72', 436, 5, 8, 803314) GANDHIJI: And He is Physician too.
('72', 436, 5, 9, 803349) I have no quarrel with Christian Science.
('72', 436, 5, 10, 803391) I said many years ago in Johannesburg that I accept the doctrine in toto, but I do not believe in many Christian Scientists.
('72', 436, 5, 11, 803516) It is one thing to have an intellectual belief and another thing to have a heart grasp of the truth.
('72', 436, 5, 12, 803617) I can quite endorse the statement that all illness is sin, that when a man has even a cough it is due to sin.
('72', 436, 5, 13, 803727) My blood pressure is the result of strain and overwork.
('72', 436, 5, 14, 803783) But why should I have overworked myself?
('72', 436, 5, 15, 803824) All overwork and hurry is sin.
('72', 436, 5, 16, 803855) And 1 know only too well that it was perfectly possible for me to avoid all doctors.
('72', 436, 5, 17, 803940) What I do not understand about Christian Scientists is that they make altogether too much of physical health and disease.
('72', 436, 6, 18, 804062) So long as one recognizes that disease is sin it is all right.
('72', 436, 6, 19, 804125) Even the Gita says that one has to renounce the fruit of the five senses which is maya.
('72', 436, 6, 20, 804213) God is Life and Love and Health.
('72', 436, 6, 21, 804246) I have put it somewhat differently.
('72', 436, 6, 22, 804282) God is Truth, for as our scriptures say nothing is but Truth, which is the same thing as God is Life.
('72', 436, 6, 23, 804384) And then I have said that Truth and Love are faces of the same coin, and Love is the means to find Truth which is the end.

('72', 437, 1, 2, 804674) 576. A MESSAGE 1
('72', 437, 2, 3, 804691) SEGAON, January 20, 1938 My ambition is to see the Congress recognized as the one and only party that can successfully resist the Government and deliver the goods.
('72', 437, 2, 4, 804855) It is the only party which, from its inception, has represented all minorities.
('72', 437, 2, 5, 804935) If the British Government recognize this unique position of the Congress they will not hesitate to postpone inauguration of the Federation 2 till they have satisfied the Congress.
('72', 437, 2, 6, 805115) It should not be difficult to do so if, before taking in the Princes, elementary rights of the States people are guaranteed and their representation takes place through election.
('72', 437, 2, 7, 805294) In my opinion a crisis of the first magnitude may be precipitated if Federation is sought to be imposed.
('72', 437, 2, 8, 805399) The opposition to the Act will still remain even if the present difficulty is got over in the manner suggested.
('72', 437, 2, 9, 805511) Peace, humanly speaking, can only be assured when a constitution drawn up by a Constituent Assembly supplants the present Act.
('72', 437, 2, 10, 805638) Anyway, once the right status of the Congress is fully recognized the rest becomes easy.
('72', 437, 2, 11, 805727) This is my personal view which I have not discussed with any of my co workers.

('72', 438, 3, 4, 806086) DEAR FRIEND, I was much touched by your affectionate letter of good wishes about my health.
('72', 438, 3, 5, 806178) I delayed acknowledging it till I was a little better.
('72', 438, 3, 6, 806233) Though I have not crossed the danger zone, I am much better than when your kind note was received.

('72', 438, 9, 12, 806503) DEAR FRIEND, Chander Singh Bhandari, an ex Havildar Major of the Garhwal Regiment, is a prisoner in the Naini Central Prison, undergoing 14 years’ imprisonment for disobedience of orders to fire at a crowd in Peshawar during the Civil Disobedience campaign of 1930. He has served more than half the sentence.
('72', 438, 9, 13, 806812) He wrote recently a long letter in Hindi to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to be passed on to me urging me to try to secure his release which he expected together with the other prisoners discharged by the United Provinces Government.
('72', 438, 9, 14, 807040) Before troubling you I wanted some information about the prisoner.
('72', 438, 9, 15, 807107) This appears in the letter and the enclosure received from Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
('72', 438, 9, 16, 807191) 1 On receipt of this I wired for reasons for this prisoner not
('72', 438, 10, 17, 807254) 1 Jawaharlal Nehru, in his letter to Gandhiji dated January 13, 1938, had rec ommended the case of Chander Singh, especially in view of the fact that, when in 1930 his companions of the Garhwal Regiment were contemplating not only refrain ing form shooting at their fellow countrymen but also shooting at their British officers, Chander Singh had dissuaded them from this violent action, stressing the non violent character of the civil disobedience movement.

('72', 439, 1, 3, 807809) Enclosed is the wire received from the United Provinces Premier.
('72', 439, 1, 4, 807874) I venture to ask you, if it is at all possible, to secure the discharge of this prisoner.
('72', 439, 1, 5, 807964) His expectation seems to me to be justified.
('72', 439, 1, 6, 808009) He can see no distinction between the other discharged United Provinces prisoners and himself.
('72', 439, 1, 7, 808104) He was guilty of no violence.
('72', 439, 1, 8, 808134) It is true that insubordination is held by the military to be a very grave offence.
('72', 439, 1, 9, 808218) But I feel that there were extenuating circumstances in this case.
('72', 439, 1, 10, 808285) And in any event if the United Provinces Government enjoy real autonomous powers, their wishes in respect of such cases should be respected.

('72', 439, 7, 16, 808578) MY DEAR IDIOT,
('72', 439, 8, 17, 808593) I began a fruitarian fast yesterday and I am feeling A 1. I needed it.
('72', 439, 8, 18, 808664) I want to do it for eight days.
('72', 439, 8, 19, 808696) But it would depend upon the progress I may make.
('72', 439, 8, 20, 808746) Therefore don’t you worry.
('72', 439, 8, 21, 808773) But this is to inform you that I told Lord Lothian yesterday why you had refused to be on the Lady L.’s Tuberculosis Committee.
('72', 439, 8, 22, 808901) This became necessary as Lady L. had sent through him a message asking me to lend my name to the project.
('72', 439, 8, 23, 809007) She had also said that the connection of the King Emperor with the project was only temporary.
('72', 439, 8, 24, 809102) I felt that she knew that I knew your objection.
('72', 439, 8, 25, 809151) I therefore brought your name, told him that there were no secrets between you and me (was I not wholly right?), that therefore I hoped Lady L. had not taken it amiss that you had taken me in your confidence.
('72', 439, 8, 26, 809360) I added that the initiative was wholly yours and I only knew of the deed after it was done but that your objections had made a forcible appeal to me.
('72', 439, 8, 27, 809510) Now you will tell [me] if I have done the right thing.

('72', 444, 8, 19, 814814) DEAR MR. JINNAH,
('72', 444, 9, 20, 814831) Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru told me yesterday that you were complaining to the Maulana Sahib about the absence of any reply from me to your letter 2 of 5th November in reply to one of 19th October.
('72', 444, 9, 21, 815025) The letter was received by me when I was pronounced by the doctors to be seriously ill in Calcutta.
('72', 444, 9, 22, 815125) The letter was shown to me three days after its receipt.
('72', 444, 9, 23, 815182) Had I thought it necessarily called for a reply, even though I was ill I would have sent one.
('72', 444, 9, 24, 815276) I have re read the letter.
('72', 444, 9, 25, 815303) I still think that there was nothing useful that I could have said in reply.
('72', 444, 9, 26, 815380) But, in a way, I am glad that you awaited a reply.
('72', 444, 9, 27, 815431) Here it is.
('72', 444, 9, 28, 815443) Mr. Kher told me definitely that he had a private message from you.
('72', 444, 9, 29, 815511) He delivered it to me when I was alone.
('72', 444, 9, 30, 815551) I couldhave sent you a verbal message in reply, but in order to give you a true picture of my mental state I sent you the short note.
('72', 444, 9, 31, 815685) There was nothing to hide in it.

('72', 445, 1, 2, 815823) But I did feel, as I still do, that the way in which you used it came upon me as a painful surprise.
('72', 445, 1, 3, 815924) You complain of my silence.
('72', 445, 1, 4, 815952) The reason for my silence is literally and truly in my note.
('72', 445, 1, 5, 816013) Believe me, the moment I can do something that can bring the two communities together nothing in the world can prevent me from so doing.
('72', 445, 1, 6, 816150) You seem to deny that your speech was a declaration of war, but your latter pronouncements too confirm the first impression.
('72', 445, 1, 7, 816275) How can I prove what is a matter of feeling?
('72', 445, 1, 8, 816320) In your speeches I miss the old nationalist.
('72', 445, 1, 9, 816365) When in 1915 I returned from the self imposed exile in South Africa, everybody spoke of you as one of the staunchest of nationalists and the hope of both Hindus and Mussalmans.
('72', 445, 1, 10, 816542) Are you still the same Mr. Jinnah?
('72', 445, 1, 11, 816577) If you say you are, in spite of your speeches I shall accept your word.
('72', 445, 1, 12, 816649) Lastly, you want me to come forward with some proposal.
('72', 445, 1, 13, 816705) What proposal can I make except to ask you on bended knees to be what I had thought you were.

('72', 445, 5, 23, 817238) I have glanced through your booklet.

('72', 448, 9, 13, 820603) Now that you have gone there, do not be in a hurry to return unless there is a setback in your health.
('72', 448, 9, 14, 820706) You must attune your mind to the place where you have to stay.
('72', 448, 9, 15, 820769) I shall of course continue to write to you from time to time.
('72', 448, 9, 16, 820831) What you write about Saraswatibehn is true.
('72', 448, 9, 17, 820875) But then we should accept whatever good we find wherever we are.
('72', 448, 9, 18, 820940) You should not mind or feel shy if you sit long at your meal.
('72', 448, 9, 19, 821002) You must eat only as much as you can and chew it well.
('72', 448, 9, 20, 821057) Then there will be no trouble.
('72', 448, 9, 21, 821088) If the pain does not subside, tell Saraswatidevi about it.
('72', 448, 9, 22, 821147) Do visit the sitar class and join it if you like it.
('72', 448, 9, 23, 821200) I can say I am keeping quite well—though I have to work hard at the moment.
('72', 448, 9, 24, 821276) Tell S. D. that I shall answer any questions she asks me.

('72', 449, 1, 2, 821652) 598. DISCUSSION WITH JOHN DE BOER 1
('72', 449, 2, 3, 821688) [On or before February 8, 1938] 2
('72', 449, 3, 4, 821722) Dr. John De Boer said the scheme had appealed to him most strongly, because at the back of it was non violence.
('72', 449, 3, 5, 821834) His difficulty was why non violence figured so little on the syllabus.
('72', 449, 3, 6, 821905) [GANDHIJI:] The reason why it has appealed to you is quite all right.
('72', 449, 3, 7, 821975) But the whole syllabus cannot centre round non violence.
('72', 449, 3, 8, 822032) It is enough to remember that it emerges from a non violent brain.
('72', 449, 3, 9, 822099) But it does not presuppose the acceptance of non violence by those who accept it.
('72', 449, 3, 10, 822181) Thus, for instance, all the members of the Committee do not accept non violence as a creed.
('72', 449, 3, 11, 822273) Just as a vegetarian need not necessarily be a believer in non violence—he may be a vegetarian for reasons of health— even so those who accept the scheme need not be all believers in non violence.
('72', 449, 4, 12, 822470) I know some educationists who will have nothing to with the system because it is based on a non violent philosophy of life.
('72', 449, 4, 13, 822594) I know it.
('72', 449, 4, 14, 822605) But for that matter I know some leading men who would not accept khadi because it is based on my philosophy of life.
('72', 449, 4, 15, 822722) But how can I help it?
('72', 449, 4, 16, 822745) Non violence is certainly in the heart of the scheme, and I can easily demonstrate it, but I know that there will be little enthusiasm for it when I do so.
('72', 449, 4, 17, 822901) But those who accept the scheme accept the fact that in a land full of millions of hungry people you cannot teach their children by any other method, and that if you can get the thing going the result will be a new economic order.
('72', 449, 4, 18, 823132) That is quite enough for me, as it is enough for me that Congressmen accept non violence as a method for obtaining independence, but not as a way of life.
('72', 449, 4, 19, 823287) If the whole of India accepted non violence as a creed and a way of life, we should be able to establish a republic immediately.
('72', 449, 5, 20, 823416) There is one thing now which I do not understand.
('72', 449, 5, 21, 823466) I am a socialist, and whilst as a believer in non violence the scheme appeals to me most, I feel as a socialist that the scheme would cut India adrift from the world, whereas we have to integrate with the whole world, and socialism does it as nothing else does.
('72', 449, 5, 22, 823728) I have no difficulty.
('72', 449, 5, 23, 823750) We do not want to cut adrift from the whole world.
('72', 449, 5, 24, 823801) We will have a free interchange with all nations, but the present forced interchange has to go.
('72', 449, 5, 25, 823897) We do not want to be exploited, neither
('72', 449, 6, 26, 823937) 1 Reproduced from Mahadev Desai’s “Notes”.
('72', 449, 6, 27, 823980) Dr. John De Boer, incharge of an educational institution in South India, visited Gandhiji at Segaon before the latter’s departure for Haripura on February 8.
('72', 450, 0, 1, 824138) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 451
('72', 450, 1, 2, 824182) do we want to exploit any other nation.
('72', 450, 1, 3, 824222) Through the scheme we look forward to making all children producers, and so to change the face of the whole nation, for it will permeate the whole of our social being.
('72', 450, 1, 4, 824390) But that does not mean that we cut adrift from the whole world.
('72', 450, 1, 5, 824454) There will be nations that will want to interchange with others because they cannot produce certain things.
('72', 450, 1, 6, 824562) They will certainly depend on other nations for them, but the nations that will provide for them should not exploit them.
('72', 450, 2, 7, 824684) But if you simplify your life to an extent that you need nothing from other countries, you will isolate yourselves from them; whereas I want you to be responsible for America also.
('72', 450, 2, 8, 824865) It is by ceasing to exploit and to be exploited that we can be responsible for America.
('72', 450, 2, 9, 824953) For America will then follow our example and there will be no difficulty in a free interchange between us.
('72', 450, 3, 10, 825060) But you want to simplify life and cut out industrialization.
('72', 450, 3, 11, 825121) If I could produce all my country’s wants by means of the labour of 30,000 people instead of 30 million I should not mind it, provided that the thirty million are not rendered idle and unemp loyed.
('72', 450, 3, 12, 825319) I know that socialists would introduce industrialization to the extent of reducing working hours to one or two in a day, but I do not want it.
('72', 450, 4, 13, 825462) They would have leisure.
('72', 450, 4, 14, 825487) Leisure to play hockey?
('72', 450, 5, 15, 825511) Not only for that but for creative handicrafts for instance.
('72', 450, 5, 16, 825572) Creative handicrafts I am asking them to engage in.
('72', 450, 5, 17, 825624) But they will produce with their hands by working eight hours a day.
('72', 450, 6, 18, 825693) You do not of course look forward to a state of society when every house will have a radio and everyone a car.
('72', 450, 6, 19, 825804) That was President Hoover’s formula.
('72', 450, 6, 20, 825841) He wanted not one but two radios and two cars.
('72', 450, 6, 21, 825888) If we had so many cars there would be very little room left for walking.
('72', 450, 7, 22, 825961) I agree.
('72', 450, 7, 23, 825970) We have about 40,000 deaths by accidents every year and thrice as many cases of people being maimed.
('72', 450, 7, 24, 826071) At any rate I am not going to live to see the day when all villages in India will have radios.
('72', 450, 8, 25, 826166) Pandiit Jawaharlal seems to think in term of the economy of abundance.
('72', 450, 8, 26, 826237) I know.
('72', 450, 8, 27, 826245) But what is abundance?
('72', 450, 8, 28, 826268) Not the capacity to destroy millions of tons of wheat as you do in America?
('72', 451, 0, 1, 826344) 452 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 451, 1, 2, 826386) Yes, that’s the nemesis of Capitalism.
('72', 451, 1, 3, 826425) They do not destroy now, but they are being paid for not producing wheat.
('72', 451, 1, 4, 826499) People indulged in the pastime of throwing eggs at one another because the prices of eggs had gone down.
('72', 451, 1, 5, 826604) That is what we do not want.
('72', 451, 1, 6, 826633) If by abundance you mean everyone having plenty to eat and drink and to clothe himself with, enough to keep his mind trained and educated, I should be satisfied.
('72', 451, 1, 7, 826795) But I should not like to pack more stuff in my belly than I can digest and more things than I can ever usefully use.
('72', 451, 1, 8, 826912) But neither do I want poverty, penury, misery, dirt and dust in India.
('72', 451, 2, 9, 826983) But Pandit Jawaharlal says in his autobiography you worship Daridranarayana and extol poverty for its own sake.
('72', 451, 3, 10, 827095) Gandhiji said with a laugh: I know.

('72', 452, 5, 9, 828308) HARIPURA, February 10, 1938 Bhai Shankerlal referred to the void created by Panditji’s passing away.
('72', 452, 5, 10, 828409) It is not surprising that I am pained because Panditji is no more among us.
('72', 452, 5, 11, 828485) When I sent the late Maganlal [Gandhi] to Pandit Vishnu Digambar [Paluskar] for acquiring for the newly established Satyagraha Ashram a good music teacher, the old Pandit knew whom he had to recommend.
('72', 452, 5, 12, 828687) Pandit Khare justified his choice and filled the position to which he was called as no one else could have done.
('72', 452, 5, 13, 828800) His death is likely to leave an unfillable gap.
('72', 452, 5, 14, 828848) Few people who have devoted themselves to art are known to have achieved such a unique combination of devotion to art and a pure and blameless life.
('72', 452, 5, 15, 828997) We have somehow accustomed ourselves to the belief that art is independent of the purity of private life.
('72', 452, 5, 16, 829103) I can say with all the experience at my command that nothing could be more untrue.
('72', 452, 5, 17, 829186) As I am nearing the end of my earthly life I can say that purity of life is the highest and truest art.
('72', 452, 5, 18, 829290) The art of producing good music from a cultivated voice can be achieved by many, but the art of producing that music from the harmony of a pure life is but achieved very rarely.
('72', 452, 5, 19, 829468) Pandit Khare was one of those rare people who had achieved it in full measure.
('72', 452, 5, 20, 829547) There has been no occasion when I had the slightest doubt about his purity.
('72', 452, 5, 21, 829623) Let Gujarat continue to take the interest in music awakened by the late Panditji.
('72', 452, 5, 22, 829705) I am hoping that his two children 2 will be worthy of him and I have no doubt that his brave wife 3 will give an example of

('72', 453, 1, 2, 829969) what a dedicated life an Indian widow’s can be.
('72', 453, 1, 3, 830017) As for Panditji, though he died in the prime of his life, anyone would envy him his death which came to him whilst he was working in a sacred place like this, fully conscious that his sands were running out and so went with Ramanama on his lips and with the echoes of the sacred name about him.
('72', 453, 1, 4, 830312) May Gujarat treasure his sweet memory.
('72', 453, 1, 5, 830351) When an exhibition of this kind was first opened at Lucknow 1 I had said that our exhibitions should be schools of instruction.
('72', 453, 1, 6, 830479) Since then we have been progressing successfully towards the ideal and the exhibition I have just now been through and am declaring open is such an annual training school.
('72', 453, 1, 7, 830651) It is not, as exhibitions of old used to be, a place of entertainment.
('72', 453, 1, 8, 830722) It is a place of instruction for the hundreds of thousands of those who will be visiting it during the week or two that it will be on.
('72', 453, 1, 9, 830857) It provides to the poor man who visits it a kind of victual for the next year’s journey.
('72', 453, 1, 10, 830946) It arms him with knowledge of an occupation which can carry him and his family through for the next year by his working at it for eight hours.
('72', 453, 1, 11, 831089) It ensures the training in securing an honest livelihood to everyone who will use his or her hands and feet, no matter how ignorant or illiterate he or she may be.
('72', 453, 1, 12, 831253) I have spent an hour this morning at the exhibition.
('72', 453, 1, 13, 831306) Please don’t think for a moment that there should be nothing new in it for one who is the President of the All India Spinners’ Association and who is guiding the All India Village Industries Association.
('72', 453, 1, 14, 831510) Even if you think so, I am not such a simpleton as to entertain the belief.
('72', 453, 1, 15, 831586) I would like to spend not one hour, but hours there learning something new every moment.
('72', 453, 1, 16, 831675) But I confess that I should not be able to earn my livelihood from an occupation that I might pick up there.
('72', 453, 1, 17, 831784) At the present moment I am begging for my livelihood, which perhaps is inevitable for one like me.
('72', 453, 1, 18, 831883) But I am sure that it is possible for any able bodied man or woman to choose one of the many industries exhibited here as a means of honest livelihood.
('72', 453, 1, 19, 832035) Shankerlal had suggested to me to point out any defects here.
('72', 453, 1, 20, 832097) It is of course my duty to do so.
('72', 453, 1, 21, 832131) One act of omission that I have noticed is that we do not preserve in the form of a book whatever we achieve in a year.
('72', 453, 1, 22, 832251) I think we should preserve in book form pictures and detailed descriptions of new inventions and experiments so that a dynamic and experienced teacher may be able to teach a lot with its

('72', 454, 1, 2, 832580) We should have the ability to do it.
('72', 454, 1, 3, 832617) We should co ordinate the crafts and put them before the public.
('72', 454, 1, 4, 832682) We should learn this art of compiling a yearly textbook.
('72', 454, 1, 5, 832739) We have not yet learnt it.
('72', 454, 1, 6, 832766) Here perhaps we have not been able to fully demonstrate how every single exhibit is made.
('72', 454, 1, 7, 832856) I have often said that if seven lakhs of the villages of India were to be kept alive, and if peace that is at the root of all civilization is to be achieved, we have to make the spinning wheel the centre of all handicrafts.
('72', 454, 1, 8, 833080) Thus my faith in the spinning wheel is growing everyday and I see more and more clearly that the sun of the wheel will alone illumine the planets of other handicrafts.
('72', 454, 1, 9, 833248) Now I go a step further and say that just as we go on discovering new stars and planets in the vast solar system, even so we should go on discovering fresh handicrafts everyday.
('72', 454, 1, 10, 833426) But, for the sake of this thing we have to make the spinning wheel the really life giving sun.
('72', 454, 1, 11, 833521) 1 I made the spinning wheel in every home a necessary condition for the inauguration of the satyagraha in Bardoli in 1921, and though I knew that the condition was far from being satisfied, I yielded to the importunities of the late Vithalbhai and inaugurated the satyagraha.
('72', 454, 1, 12, 833797) What followed, you know very well.
('72', 454, 1, 13, 833832) Well, I would even today ask the people of Bardoli to fulfil that condition of one wheel in every home.
('72', 454, 1, 14, 833936) That will help you supplement your small income and make you self sufficient.
('72', 454, 1, 15, 834014) At many places in this exhibition you will see [the presence of] art.
('72', 454, 1, 16, 834084) I cannot describe it to you.
('72', 454, 1, 17, 834113) It will strike your eye.
('72', 454, 1, 18, 834138) We shall get to see here how a particular thing could be displayed to the best advantage by exhibiting it in a certain way.
('72', 454, 1, 19, 834262) Art is a means of bringing out the inner as well as the outer beauty of a thing.
('72', 454, 1, 20, 834343) We have now amongst us our own Indian artist Nanda Babu 2 from the time of the Lucknow exhibition.
('72', 454, 1, 21, 834442) He showed his artistic skill then and is ever progressing.
('72', 454, 1, 22, 834501) But here we have artists from Gujarat also.
('72', 454, 1, 23, 834545) Just as Panditji introduced music in Gujarat, Bhai Ravishankar 3 introduced art.
('72', 454, 1, 24, 834626) Here you will see his art along with that of Kanu Desai.
('72', 454, 1, 25, 834683) There are different departments of art and in each you will find it thoroughly applied.
('72', 454, 1, 26, 834771) You will see the artistic skill of Vakilbehn in the khadi department.
('72', 454, 1, 27, 834841) Now do think many times over what I have said.
('72', 454, 1, 28, 834888) Do see the exhibition as often as you can and gain all the knowledge it offers and delight yourselves.
('72', 454, 1, 29, 834991) The big ones of the Congress will come here and run the show; but the true Congress is in the exhibition.

('72', 455, 3, 5, 835399) [February 10, 1938] 2
('72', 455, 4, 6, 835421) Gandhiji was taken to where some of the children in some of the national schools and ashrams in Gujarat were shown to be earning from spinning three to four annas a day.
('72', 455, 4, 7, 835591) That is nothing.
('72', 455, 4, 8, 835608) So far as the schools are concerned, you have to concentrate on showing that we can teach everything through the handicrafts, e.g., that of spinning.
('72', 455, 4, 9, 835758) Literary education plus training in a handicraft is no novel conception.
('72', 455, 4, 10, 835831) The novel conception is that of making the handicraft the principal means of imparting literary training.
('72', 455, 5, 11, 835937) Then as regards the wage, he said: You are sadly mistaken if you think that you have achieved the ideal.
('72', 455, 5, 12, 836042) The ideal is one anna per hour, and when poor Maharashtra has been able to achieve the average wage of three to four annas per day, rich Gujarat cannot rest satisfied with giving its spinners that wage.
('72', 455, 5, 13, 836245) You have to think in terms of the wages obtainable in your province and should not be satisfied unless you have reached eight annas as the minimum wage.
('72', 455, 6, 14, 836398) “But then the price of khadi will be prohibitive,” said a worker.
('72', 455, 6, 15, 836464) That is no answer.
('72', 455, 6, 16, 836483) You must make up your mind that eight annas has to be made the minimum wage, and leave no stone unturned until you have achieved it.
('72', 455, 6, 17, 836616) Cut out the overhead charges, make the count finer and finer, but see that you reach the goal.
('72', 455, 6, 18, 836711) That khadi will not be sold is a superstition.
('72', 455, 6, 19, 836758) The same fear was expressed when we introduced the new spinning wage 3 and we know how that fear has been falsified.

('72', 456, 3, 4, 837283) As we were returning from the exhibition, Gandhiji said with a sigh to Sardar Vallabhbhai: What a tragedy it is that we are far behind other provinces in the matter of khadi, and yet we have no excuse.
('72', 456, 3, 5, 837485) We produce the best cotton in India, and there is no reason why we should not be able to pay the highest minimum wage and cover Gujarat with khadi.

('72', 456, 6, 15, 837909) Balwantsinha has come [with us].
('72', 456, 6, 16, 837942) Tell Saraswatidevi that I am rather afraid of allowing you to eat the pips and skin of oranges.
('72', 456, 6, 17, 838038) Once the pain in the stomach disappears, I would give you even orange pips and skin to eat if that is necessary for further improvement.
('72', 456, 6, 18, 838175) Right now I have sent you there to cure you if possible by earth and water treatment and a diet of chapatis, etc.
('72', 456, 6, 19, 838289) If you do not find appreciable improvement by the 22nd, come back with Saraswatidevi’s permission.
('72', 456, 6, 20, 838388) Shakaribehn is here.
('72', 456, 6, 21, 838409) I certainly propose to talk to her.

('72', 457, 9, 11, 838975) February 11, 1938
('72', 457, 10, 12, 838993) Mahatma Gandhi urged the volunteers to do the work of Bhangis earnestly.
('72', 457, 10, 13, 839066) He added: Don’t think your work is inferior to that of Rashtrapati Bose or Jawaharlal Nehru.
('72', 457, 10, 14, 839159) No, not an atom.
('72', 457, 10, 15, 839176) They serve and you also serve and, in fact, I value your work more.
('72', 457, 10, 16, 839244) I myself am an experienced Bha ngi and a competent Bhangi.
('72', 457, 10, 17, 839303) Do your work sincerely and earnestly.
('72', 457, 10, 18, 839341) A large number of delegates will be shortly coming and if there are shortcomings in your work they will complain, though I cannot complain for I am not a delegate, nor do I intend to become one.
('72', 457, 11, 19, 839536) You know that you are engaged in a work that I like most.
('72', 457, 11, 20, 839594) The Bhangi has been the most despised of the Harjans, because his work has been regarded as the most degrading.
('72', 457, 11, 21, 839706) Many forget the important social service rendered by Bhangis.
('72', 457, 11, 22, 839768) 4 But we forgot that our mothers did that very work whilst we were babies innocent of all cleanliness.
('72', 457, 11, 23, 839871) If that work was ignoble the Bhangi’s would be ignoble, but if it was noble the Bhangi’s work is also noble.
('72', 457, 11, 24, 839980) But our mothers cleaned our filth because we were their babies, because they could not do otherwise, because they were wrapped up in us and adored their own selves in us.
('72', 457, 11, 25, 840151) Their work was thus selfish.
('72', 457, 11, 26, 840180) The volunteer Bhangi’s work is unselfish and so nobler than that of mothers.
('72', 457, 11, 27, 840257) And if I revere my mother and therefore the whole of womankind, is it not clear that I should adore the volunteer Bhangi even more?
('72', 457, 12, 28, 840389) 1 The superscription is in Gujarati.
('72', 457, 12, 29, 840426) 2 Under the leadership of V. L. Phadke and Jugatram Dave about 1200 volunteers were engaged in sanitation work at the Congress Camp at Haripura.

('72', 458, 0, 1, 840661) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 459
('72', 458, 1, 2, 840705) I am, therefore, happy that you have taken upon yourselves this noble work.
('72', 458, 1, 3, 840781) But you must know how to do it.
('72', 458, 1, 4, 840813) The work has to be done lovingly and intelligently.
('72', 458, 1, 5, 840865) Lovingly because those who are responsible for dirt and filth know not what they do, and intelligently because we have to help them to reform their habits and improve their health.
('72', 458, 1, 6, 841046) An ideal Bhangi is one who knows the principles of nutrition and can trace the quality of the excreta to the kind of health that is possessed by the owner.
('72', 458, 1, 7, 841202) Thus only can you ennoble the profession.
('72', 458, 1, 8, 841244) I say this because I am an expert Bhangi, I have been doing this work for over thirty five years and I have done it in the proper spirit.
('72', 458, 1, 9, 841382) I would, therefore, ask you to approach everyone with kindness and respect, especially because you will come across ignorant people, innocent of the principles of sanitation.
('72', 458, 1, 10, 841557) You will speak to them gently and explain to them that cleanliness demands that they should observe the sanitation rules of the Congress.
('72', 458, 1, 11, 841695) If you have achieved this art, I shall regard you as better than Congress delegates.
('72', 458, 1, 12, 841780) This is not to disparage the delegates, but to tell you what exactly is Congress work.
('72', 458, 1, 13, 841867) It was not for nothing that I retired from the Congress.
('72', 458, 1, 14, 841924) I am not a delegate nor even an ordinary member but there is some rahasya 1
('72', 458, 2, 15, 842000) behind this.
('72', 458, 2, 16, 842013) 2 I saw that I needed not to be a delegate of the Congress so much as I needed to do Congress work.
('72', 458, 2, 17, 842113) And I hope to continue to do so, so long as my silent service is accepted by the people.
('72', 458, 2, 18, 842202) For me, to turn the wheel, to be engaged in other handicrafts, to do scavenging and sanitation work in the Congress spirit, is to do Congress work and I should be content to bury myself in a village doing this work as long as God wants me to live on this earth.
('72', 458, 3, 19, 842464) Proceeding, the Mahatma observed that it was the primary duty of everyone to be clean and also keep his surroundings clean.
('72', 458, 3, 20, 842588) Those who did the Bhangi’s work should first be their own Bhangis.
('72', 458, 4, 21, 842655) You must know the full technique of the work and do it in a civilized manner.
('72', 458, 4, 22, 842733) I have done the work of the Bhangi and I have good experience of that work.
('72', 458, 4, 23, 842809) Your work does not require any degree.
('72', 458, 4, 24, 842848) Any man with common sense can do it.
('72', 458, 4, 25, 842885) It requires a pure and tender heart, as it requires clean and stout hands.
('72', 458, 4, 26, 842960) If you have both, and address yourselves to this task, 1,200 stalwarts like you will be enough to win swaraj.
('72', 458, 4, 27, 843070) I said this years
('72', 458, 5, 28, 843088) 1 Hidden meaning 2 This sentence is from The Hindu 3 This and the following paragraph are from The Hindu.

('72', 459, 1, 3, 843280) But have you the required pure hearts?
('72', 459, 2, 4, 843319) I have got a demand from volunteers for free admission to the exhibition and I have reserved the last day for them when other members of their community come here to witness the session.
('72', 459, 2, 5, 843506) My advice is this, that you must concentrate on your work and refrain from going there; and if you are overanxious, borrow money from friends and see the exhibition.
('72', 459, 2, 6, 843672) I don’t think we should open this exhi bition free to all; for these two annas benefit crores of people.
('72', 459, 2, 7, 843777) Those who have money and still don’t spend it will he considered thieves.

('72', 460, 1, 2, 844876) 609. SPEECH AT EXHIBITION 1
('72', 460, 2, 3, 844904) February 13, 1938 Goraksha—‘cow protection’—is not the proper word, goseva— the service of the cow—is our ideal.
('72', 460, 2, 4, 845017) At the back of the present unfortunate state of things is our ignorance which in its turn is due to our lethargy.
('72', 460, 2, 5, 845131) If we try to go to the root of the pure science of cloth making, we will find that the spinning wheel is the sine qua non.
('72', 460, 2, 6, 845254) In the same way if you study the science of milk, you will find in India at any rate the service of the cow to be the sine qua non.
('72', 460, 2, 7, 845386) My study of the science as well as my consultations with experts have shown to me that it is impossible to save both the cow and the buffalo.
('72', 460, 2, 8, 845528) It is likely that after the cow has been saved the buffalo may also remain to a certain extent.
('72', 460, 2, 9, 845624) But if you allow the buffalo to compete with the cow, both the buffalo and the cow will be extinct.
('72', 460, 2, 10, 845724) What is necessary is to realize that the cow is really the more economic proposition as our own forefathers realized when they styled their kings as the protectors of the cow and the Brahmin.
('72', 460, 2, 11, 845916) But mark that they mentioned the cow first, because even the existence of the Brahmins, i.
('72', 460, 2, 12, 846007) e., the spiritual leaders of the community, depends on that of the cow.
('72', 460, 2, 13, 846079) You in Bardoli have laboured under the superstition that the cow cannot be economic and that the buffalo alone is your mainstay.
('72', 460, 2, 14, 846208) I tell you that it is a myth and that if you bestow on the cow the care that you do on the buffalo and try to understand the real economics of the cow, you will find in the long run that it is more economic than the buffalo.
('72', 460, 2, 15, 846433) We have wasted our energies so far in saving the cow from the butcher’s hands.
('72', 460, 2, 16, 846512) Why should we try to wrest it from the butcher’s hands?
('72', 460, 2, 17, 846568) The butcher has to pursue his profession.
('72', 460, 2, 18, 846610) To blame the butcher is like blaming the doctor for your fever.
('72', 460, 2, 19, 846674) We have allowed it to go into the butcher’s hands because of our gross neglect, and we are wholly responsible for its slaughter.
('72', 460, 2, 20, 846803) It is for us to make it economically unnecessary and so impossible to sell the cow to the butcher.
('72', 460, 2, 21, 846902) This exhibition and the tannery you will see in the bigger exhibition will show you that it is impossible to do so.

('72', 465, 2, 3, 851777) HARIPURA, February 16, 1938
('72', 465, 3, 4, 851805) At the outset, Gandhiji satisfied himself by taking the vote of the audience that his speech in Hindi would be understood by them.
('72', 465, 4, 5, 851936) A friend here has complained that if this speech had been arranged outside the exhibition, people could have attended it more easily and even the poor could have heard it.
('72', 465, 4, 6, 852108) Here only those who have purchased a two anna ticket have been admitted.
('72', 465, 4, 7, 852181) I accept this is a drawback.
('72', 465, 4, 8, 852210) But you should realize that I am helpless.
('72', 465, 4, 9, 852253) My voice does not function properly, my body cannot work as hard as I would like it to.
('72', 465, 4, 10, 852341) Hence, it is better that I work within certain limits.
('72', 465, 4, 11, 852396) I am no longer fit to address large gatherings.
('72', 465, 4, 12, 852444) But, after all I am a bania, and an Indian bania at that, hence I feel that I should promptly grab what I can even if it is only two annas.
('72', 465, 4, 13, 852584) If people like to hear me, they will come and incidentally also visit the exhibition.
('72', 465, 4, 14, 852670) And if they understand me properly, they will become my messengers and take my message to thousands of people.
('72', 465, 4, 15, 852781) After all, how far can one man’s voice reach?
('72', 465, 4, 16, 852827) However great a mahatma I may be, I don’t presume that I can move the whole of India by my own strength.
('72', 465, 4, 17, 852932) I have never even dreamt of it.
('72', 465, 4, 18, 852964) If people intelligently appreciate what I say and let it sink into their hearts and propagate it to others, our task is as good as accomplished.
('72', 465, 4, 19, 853109) Please, therefore, do not complain that I address myself only to a few but understand that I expect to take work from all.
('72', 465, 4, 20, 853232) If I can give my message to one person, through him I can reach crores of people.
('72', 465, 4, 21, 853314) And I do wish to reach the crores.
('72', 465, 4, 22, 853349) Ever since I started the khadi movement, I have been saying that I was born to serve Daridranarayana; I live for it and wish to die for it.
('72', 465, 4, 23, 853489) I shall regard myself as having fulfilled the mission of my life if I die while doing this work.
('72', 465, 4, 24, 853586) I have the satisfaction that, if I have done nothing else, I have on this account collected money for the poor.
('72', 465, 4, 25, 853698) This is also true of the evening prayers.
('72', 465, 4, 26, 853740) If the attendance at these prayers is very large, we cannot pray in peace.
('72', 465, 4, 27, 853815) And yet I would be happy, if I could hold the prayers in a place where hundreds of thousands of people can gather.
('72', 465, 4, 28, 853930) But we have not yet educated ourselves to sit quietly through such occasions.
('72', 465, 4, 29, 854008) No single group in

('72', 466, 1, 2, 854108) India—Hindus, Muslims, Parsis, Christians—should entertain the belief that their own faith alone is true and those of others are false.
('72', 466, 1, 3, 854244) It would be a good thing if everyone prayed sincerely and with equal regard for all faiths.
('72', 466, 1, 4, 854336) I pray thus for myself and include as many as are present here.
('72', 466, 1, 5, 854400) This is by way of introduction.
('72', 466, 1, 6, 854432) I spoke of one thing in Faizpur 1. Today, I shall speak about another.
('72', 466, 1, 7, 854503) There was a devout poet of Gujarat.
('72', 466, 1, 8, 854539) We call him the first poet of Gujarat.
('72', 466, 1, 9, 854578) His name was Narasinh Mehta.
('72', 466, 1, 10, 854607) We know him not as a renowned poet but as a saint.
('72', 466, 1, 11, 854658) He was a Nagar 2 belonging to Junagadh; he lived in poverty and was a great saint.
('72', 466, 1, 12, 854741) He was a poet no doubt, but he did not write to become [famous as] a poet; he composed poems simply in devotion to God.
('72', 466, 1, 13, 854861) I have not found in any other language the like of prabhatiyan 3
('72', 466, 2, 14, 854926) composed by Narasinh Mehta.
('72', 466, 2, 15, 854954) In one of these he writes: 4
('72', 466, 3, 16, 854983) So long as we have not recognized the essence of our atman, all other striving is in vain.
('72', 466, 3, 17, 855074) In the case of khadi I want to apply this to mean that so long as we have not understood the principle underlying khadi, we should regard all our other work as futile.
('72', 466, 3, 18, 855242) If 30 crores of people want to clothe themselves, why should they use the cloth made in the mills of Paris or Ahmedabad and not one made by the hands of the poor?
('72', 466, 3, 19, 855405) Khadi may be worn by the devout as well as by the hypocrite or the treacherous; by the chastest of wives as well as by a prostitute.
('72', 466, 3, 20, 855538) There was a time when only this cloth was made in India and no other, hence everyone used khadi and nothing else.
('72', 466, 3, 21, 855652) It is not that there were no thieves or robbers then, or that there were no prostitutes, but they did not understand either the significance of or the principle underlying khadi.
('72', 466, 3, 22, 855831) Let me explain it to you.
('72', 466, 3, 23, 855857) Ever since I started speaking of khadi, I have been saying that khadi is pure swadeshi.
('72', 466, 3, 24, 855945) I have also been claiming that swaraj hangs by the handspun yarn; the latter is also the foundation of our independence.
('72', 466, 3, 25, 856066) Some say that this is an exaggerated statement and that I speak of khadi in hyperboles like a bard who makes much of some petty thing.
('72', 466, 3, 26, 856201) But I have never resorted to exaggeration.
('72', 466, 3, 27, 856244) I claim to be a satyagrahi.
('72', 466, 3, 28, 856272) Such a one does not tell a lie.
('72', 466, 3, 29, 856304) Whether one describes a single thing as two or a hundred thousand, both involve falsehood.
('72', 466, 3, 30, 856395) How then did I, a satyagrahi, make such a

('72', 467, 1, 2, 856630) statement?
('72', 467, 1, 3, 856641) After so many years I have again started repeating the same thing.
('72', 467, 1, 4, 856708) Khadi can bring swaraj only if we are convinced of the principle underlying it.
('72', 467, 1, 5, 856788) Swaraj cannot be won just by donning khadi without any understanding.
('72', 467, 1, 6, 856858) What do the wealthy people of Ahmeda bad know of business dealings?
('72', 467, 1, 7, 856926) They just fill their own bellies, bring up their own children, and throw money to a few labourers.
('72', 467, 1, 8, 857025) I claim to be a [real] businessman.
('72', 467, 1, 9, 857061) I propose to bring dal, rice, roti and ghee to every Indian.
('72', 467, 1, 10, 857122) I wish no one to remain unclothed.
('72', 467, 1, 11, 857157) So long as this is not accomplished, my business is not worth its name.
('72', 467, 1, 12, 857229) I shall be able to carry on true business if you carry out my suggestions.
('72', 467, 1, 13, 857304) The U.P. and Bihar Ministers are here having tendered their resignations.
('72', 467, 1, 14, 857378) There is nothing very extraordinary about it.
('72', 467, 1, 15, 857424) They accepted their offices in full knowledge of the fact that the Constitution is a bauble.
('72', 467, 1, 16, 857517) What has happened in Bihar and the U.P. may happen tomorrow in Bombay and the day after in Madras.
('72', 467, 1, 17, 857616) But I am going to tell you today why exactly the thing has happened.
('72', 467, 1, 18, 857685) If I am a Minister it is within my power to release prisoners, no matter whether they are three or thirty.
('72', 467, 1, 19, 857792) What right has the Governor to interfere?
('72', 467, 1, 20, 857834) I am Minister because I have the majority of votes, and so long as I hold the office, there is no one to question my authority to release the prisoners.
('72', 467, 1, 21, 857987) But the Governors of two provinces have interfered.
('72', 467, 1, 22, 858039) Let me tell you why.
('72', 467, 1, 23, 858060) Pace what the socialist friends may say, I hold that the Governors dared to interfere because we have not realized the implications of khadi.
('72', 467, 1, 24, 858202) Khadi has been conceived as the foundation and symbol of ahimsa.
('72', 467, 1, 25, 858267) A real khadi wearer will not utter an untruth.
('72', 467, 1, 26, 858314) I am not talking about the hypocrites who don khadi nor about those who do it to fill their bellies.
('72', 467, 1, 27, 858415) A real khadi wearer will harbour no violence, no deceit, no impurity.
('72', 467, 1, 28, 858485) To those who will say, ‘If this is khadi, we will not wear it’, I will say, ‘You are welcome to do what you like, but then you must forget about winning swaraj by means of truth and non violence.
('72', 467, 1, 29, 858681) Nor would I compel you to observe truth and non violence, nor even to win swaraj after my method’.
('72', 467, 1, 30, 858780) Seven and a half lakh rupees have gone into the making of Vithalnagar.
('72', 467, 1, 31, 858851) There are many things here I have liked, but it lacks the spirit of khadi.
('72', 467, 1, 32, 858926) Sardar and I are close to each other, we are as one, we work alike and we think alike, but it may be that even Sardar has not fully grasped the secret of khadi.
('72', 467, 1, 33, 859087) Where there is the conscious endeavour to fulfil the spirit of khadi, there is no place for an expenditure of seven and a half lakhs.
('72', 467, 1, 34, 859221) I had said that we should be
('72', 468, 0, 1, 859250) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 469
('72', 468, 1, 2, 859294) able to hold a village session at the outside expense of Rs. 5,000. Before the Faizpur Congress I told Deo 1 that he would be found wanting in my estimate if he failed to manage it with Rs. 5,000. And he did fail.
('72', 468, 1, 3, 859508) Well, the idea has still not left my mind.
('72', 468, 1, 4, 859551) If we cannot do this, we are not true soldiers of swaraj, we have not become real villagers.
('72', 468, 1, 5, 859644) Rural mindedness and electrical illuminations go ill together.
('72', 468, 1, 6, 859707) Nor have motor cars and motor lorries any place there.
('72', 468, 1, 7, 859762) They took me to Faizpur and they brought me to Haripura in a car.
('72', 468, 1, 8, 859828) They would not allow me to walk.
('72', 468, 1, 9, 859861) They would not even take me in a bullock cart.
('72', 468, 1, 10, 859908) That was reserved for Subhas Babu.
('72', 468, 1, 11, 859943) If they had brought me in a bullock cart, it would have meant some loss of time.
('72', 468, 1, 12, 860024) But how does that matter?
('72', 468, 1, 13, 860050) We have all become princes, and I am told some pedestrians waylaid cars and threatened satyagraha if they were not given cars.
('72', 468, 1, 14, 860177) The seven and a half lakhs would not have been spent here if we were khadi minded.
('72', 468, 1, 15, 860260) Here there are petrol and oil engines and water pipes, stoves and electricity, most of the modern city dwellers’ amenities, including the tooth paste and the tooth brush and scented hair oils.
('72', 468, 1, 16, 860453) The villager is or should be unspoilt by these things.
('72', 468, 1, 17, 860508) His brush is the fresh babul stick and his powder is salt and charcoal.
('72', 468, 1, 18, 860580) You wear khadi, but what about the other things that surround you and are out of keeping with khadi?
('72', 468, 1, 19, 860681) After going round I have discovered five drawbacks, and I have informed Shankerlal [Banker] about these.
('72', 468, 1, 20, 860786) Because we have not assimilated and lived the mantra of khadi, some socialist friends are impatient with us and say that Gandhi’s days are gone and a new age is upon us.
('72', 468, 1, 21, 860956) I do not mind this, in fact I welcome plain speaking.
('72', 468, 1, 22, 861010) If you think that what I say deserves to be rejected, do by all means reject it.
('72', 468, 1, 23, 861091) Do what you do for the sake of India, not for my sake.
('72', 468, 1, 24, 861146) I am but an image of clay, which is sure to be reduced to cinders.
('72', 468, 1, 25, 861213) If you wear khadi for my sake, you will burn khadi on the day you burn my dead body.
('72', 468, 1, 26, 861298) But if you have fully understood the message of khadi, if you have thoroughly assimilated it, khadi will long outlive me.
('72', 468, 1, 27, 861420) Khadi is not a lifeless image to be worshipped externally.
('72', 468, 1, 28, 861479) True worship is not idol worship, it is the worship of the God in the idol.
('72', 468, 1, 29, 861555) If we miss the spirit of khadi and make only a fetish of it, we are no better than gross idolators.
('72', 468, 1, 30, 861655) For twenty years I have preached the cult of khadi to my countrymen.
('72', 468, 1, 31, 861724) And this is the only message I have been carrying to one and all, all these twenty years.
('72', 468, 1, 32, 861814) I want to preach the same cult today

('72', 469, 3, 9, 862295) HARIPURA, February 16, 1938 2
('72', 469, 4, 10, 862325) The Governor General’s interference with the proposal of the Bihar Ministers seems to be most unfortunate and uncalled for.
('72', 469, 4, 11, 862449) I have read and re read Section 126 (5 ) of the Government of India Act.
('72', 469, 4, 12, 862522) It authorizes interference when there is a grave menace to peace and tranquillity in any part of India through any action proposed by Ministers.
('72', 469, 4, 13, 862667) Surely the discharge of a few prisoners, even though they were convicted of crimes involving violence, for what they no doubt erringly believed to be the country’s cause, so far as I could see, could not endanger peace and tranquillity.
('72', 469, 4, 14, 862904) The Governor General’s interfer ence would come properly if there was disorder consequent upon such release.
('72', 469, 4, 15, 863013) In the case which has brought about the interference, I under stand the Bihar Prime Minister had been assured by the prisoners that they had changed their mentality and that they wanted to live, if they were discharged, as peaceful citizens.
('72', 469, 4, 16, 863255) The action of the Governor General bewilders me and makes me suspect whether the proposal to discharge the prisoners in question was merely the last straw and that the Congress Ministers in general had fatigued the British authority.
('72', 469, 4, 17, 863489) I hope that my suspicion is groundless, but, if it is so, I fail to understand the interference unless there are good grounds of which the public have no knowledge.
('72', 469, 4, 18, 863654) How I wish it was possible for the Governor General to retrace his step and avert a crisis whose consequences nobody can foretell.

('72', 470, 2, 3, 863991) [Before February 18, 1938] 1
('72', 470, 3, 4, 864020) In accordance with the direction of the Faizpur Congress, the All India Congress Committee decided in March, 1937, the issue of acceptance of office in Provinces and permitted Congressmen to form Ministries, provided certain assurances were given by or on behalf of the British Government.
('72', 470, 3, 5, 864310) These assurances not being forthcoming, the leaders of Congress parties in the Provincial Assemblies declined at first to form Ministries.
('72', 470, 3, 6, 864449) Thereafter there was a considerable argument for some months regarding these assurances and various declarations were made by the Secretary of State for India, the Viceroy and the Governors of the Provinces.
('72', 470, 3, 7, 864657) In these declarations it was definitely stated, among other things, that there would be no interference with the day to day administration of provincial affairs by responsible Ministers.
('72', 470, 3, 8, 864844) The experience of office by Congress Ministers in the Provinces has shown that at least in two Provinces, the United Provinces and Bihar, there has in fact been interference in the day to day administration of provincial affairs as shown hereafter.
('72', 470, 3, 9, 865093) The Governors, when they invited Congress members to form Ministries, knew that the Congress Manifesto had mentioned the release of political prisoners as one of the major items of the Congress policy.
('72', 470, 3, 10, 865295) In pursuance thereof the Ministers began the release of political prisoners and they soon experienced delay, which was sometimes vexatious, before the Governors would endorse the orders of release.
('72', 470, 3, 11, 865493) The way releases have been repeatedly delayed is evidence of the exemplary patience of Ministers.
('72', 470, 3, 12, 865591) In the opinion of the Congress, release of prisoners is a matter coming essentially within the purview of day to day administration, which does not admit of protracted discussion with Governors.
('72', 470, 3, 13, 865786) The function of the Governor is to guide and advise Ministers and not to interfere with the free exercise of their judgment in the discharge of their day to day duty.
('72', 470, 3, 14, 865953) It was only when the time came for the Working Committee to give an annual account to the Congress delegates and to the masses of people backing them, that the Committee had to instruct Ministers, who were themselves sure of their ground, to order release of the political prisoners in their
('72', 470, 4, 15, 866245) 1 According to The Bombay Chronicle, 19 2 1938, the resolution drafted by Gandhiji was under discussion in the Working Committee meeting on February 18.
('72', 471, 0, 1, 866398) 472 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 471, 1, 2, 866440) charge and to resign if their orders were countermanded.
('72', 471, 1, 3, 866497) The Congress approves of and endorses the action taken by the Ministers of the United Provinces and Bihar and congratulates them on it.
('72', 471, 1, 4, 866633) In the opinion of the Congress, the interference of the Governor General with the deliberate action of the respective Prime Ministers is not merely a violation of the assurance above referred to, but it is also a misapplication of Section 126 (5) of the Government of India Act.
('72', 471, 1, 5, 866912) There was no question of grave menace to peace and tranquillity involved.
('72', 471, 1, 6, 866986) The Prime Ministers had, besides, in both cases satisfied themselves from assurances from the prisoners concerned and otherwise of their change of mentality and acceptance of the Congress policy of non violence.
('72', 471, 1, 7, 867198) Indeed it is the Governor General’s interference which has undoubtedly created a situation that may easily, in spite of the Congress effort to the contrary, become such a grave menace.
('72', 471, 1, 8, 867383) The Congress has, during the short period that Congressmen have held office, given sufficient evidence of their self sacrifice, administrative capacity and constructive ability in the matter of enacting legislation for the amelioration of economic and social evils.
('72', 471, 1, 9, 867649) The Congress gladly admits that a measure of co operation was extended by the Governors to the Ministers.
('72', 471, 1, 10, 867755) It has been the sincere effort on the part of the Congress to extract what is possible from the Act for the public good and to strengthen the people in the pursuit of their goal of complete independence and the ending of imperialistic exploitation of the masses of India.
('72', 471, 1, 11, 868027) The Congress does not desire to precipitate a crisis which may involve non violent non co operation and direct action consistent with the Congress policy of truth and non violence.
('72', 471, 1, 12, 868208) The Congress is therefore at present reluctant to instruct Ministers in other Provinces to send in their resignations by way of protest against the Governor General’s action, and invites His Excellency the Governor General to reconsider his decision so that the Governors may act constitutionally and accept the advice of their Ministers in the matter of the release of the political prisoners.
('72', 471, 1, 13, 868603) The Congress regards the formation of irresponsible Ministries as a way of disguising the naked rule of the sword.
('72', 471, 1, 14, 868718) The formation of such Ministries is calculated to rouse extreme bitterness, internal quarrels, and further deepen the resentment against the British Government.
('72', 471, 1, 15, 868879) When the Congress approved of acceptance of office, with great reluctance and considerable hesitation, it had no misgivings about its own estimate of the real nature of the Government of India Act.
('72', 471, 1, 16, 869077) The latest action of the Governor General
('72', 472, 0, 1, 869119) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 473
('72', 472, 1, 2, 869163) justifies that estimate, and not only exposes the utter inadequacy of the Act to bring real liberty to the people, but also shows the intention of the British Government to use and interpret it not for the expansion of liberty but for its restriction.
('72', 472, 1, 3, 869415) Whatever, therefore, may be the ultimate result of the present crisis, the people of India should realize that there can be no true freedom for the country so long as this Act is not ended and a new constitution, framed by a Constituent Assembly, elected on the basis of adult franchise, takes its place.
('72', 472, 1, 4, 869720) The aim of all Congressmen, whether in office or out of office, in legislatures or out of legislatures, can only be to reach that goal, even though it may mean, as it often must mean, sacrifice of many a present advantage, however beneficial and worthy it might be for the time being.
('72', 472, 1, 5, 870005) On behalf of the U.P. Governor it has been stated that the demonstrations organized to welcome the Kakori prisoners and the speeches delivered by some of them had interfered with the policy of gradual release of political prisoners.
('72', 472, 1, 6, 870238) The Congress has always, discouraged unseemly demonstrations and other objectionable activities.
('72', 472, 1, 7, 870335) The demonstrations and speeches referred to by the U.P. Governor were strongly disapproved by Mahatma Gandhi.
('72', 472, 1, 8, 870445) 1 Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, President of the Congress, had similarly taken immediate notice of the indiscipline which was thus betrayed.
('72', 472, 1, 9, 870581) Nor were they ignored by the Ministers.
('72', 472, 1, 10, 870621) As a result of these corrective steps public opinion rapidly changed and even the persons concerned came to realize their mistake.
('72', 472, 1, 11, 870752) And when six prisoners, one of whom was a prominent member of the Kakori group, were released subsequently, about two months after the release of the Kakori prisoners, no demonstrations were held in their honour nor any reception was accorded to them.
('72', 472, 1, 12, 871004) Nearly four more months have since elapsed, and any delay in releasing the remaining fifteen prisoners, only on account of the demonstrations or the speeches connected with the prisoners who were released in August, is now utterly unjustified.
('72', 472, 1, 13, 871248) The responsibility for the maintenance of law and order is that of the Ministers and they are entitled to perform their functions in such manner as they deem proper.
('72', 472, 1, 14, 871414) It is their business to weigh all relevant factors in the light of prevailing circumstances, but their decisions once taken ought to be accepted and enforced.
('72', 472, 1, 15, 871573) Any interference with them in the exercise of their powers in the normal day to day administration is bound to undermine and weaken their position.

('72', 473, 0, 1, 871781) 474 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('72', 473, 1, 2, 871823) Congress Ministers have more than once declared their determination to take adequate action in the matter of violent crime, and the risk run in releasing prisoners, especially when they have abjured the path of violence, is altogether imaginary.
('72', 473, 1, 3, 872069) The Congress has given during the past few months ample evidence of its desire to take severe notice of indiscipline and breach of the code of non violence that the Congress has laid down for itself.
('72', 473, 1, 4, 872269) Nevertheless the Congress invites the attention of Congressmen to the fact that indiscipline in speech and action, calculated to promote or breed violence, retards the progress of the country towards its cherished goal.
('72', 473, 1, 5, 872489) In pursuit of its programme of release of political prisoners, the Congress has not hesitated to sacrifice office and the opportunity of passing ameliorative measures.
('72', 473, 1, 6, 872657) But the Congress wishes to make it clear that it strongly disapproves of hungerstrikes for release.
('72', 473, 1, 7, 872757) Hunger strikes embarrass the Congress in pursuit of its policy of securing release of political prisoners.
('72', 473, 1, 8, 872864) The Congress, therefore, urges those who are still continuing their hunger strike in the Punjab to give up their strike, and assures them that whether in Provinces where Congressmen hold ministerial offices or in other Provinces, Congress men will continue their efforts to secure the release of detenus and political prisoners by all legitimate and peaceful means.
('72', 473, 1, 9, 873230) In view of the situation that has arisen in the country, the Congress authorizes the Working Committee to take such action as it may consider necessary and to take the direction of the All India Congress Committee in dealing with the crisis whenever necessity arises for it.

('72', 474, 9, 14, 873960) The fear that I had entertained about the unwarranted inter ference by Governors or the Viceroy with the due course of provincial autonomy has been justified in an unexpected manner.
('72', 474, 9, 15, 874143) I can only hope that what I regard as a grievous error may be somehow or other rectified.
('72', 474, 9, 16, 874233) I hope that there is nothing to warrant another fear that has possessed me, namely, that the British authority has been getting tired, perhaps also alarmed, over the headway Congress and Congress Ministers are making along constructive lines.
('72', 474, 9, 17, 874476) And yet it is most difficult for me to realize that the Viceroy would allow a grave crisis to be created over what must be in his estimation a paltry matter.
('72', 474, 9, 18, 874634) I have read and pondered over Section 126 (5) of the Government of India Act.
('72', 474, 9, 19, 874712) The Governor General is authorized by that Section to use his discretion “for the purpose of preventing any grave menace to the peace or tranquillity of India or any part thereof”.
('72', 474, 9, 20, 874893) Many prisoners convicted for crimes of violence in pursuit of a political motive have been discharged before now and during the period of office of the Congress Ministries.
('72', 474, 9, 21, 875066) I do not know that any menace grave or otherwise has been thereby created in respect of peace or tranquillity

('72', 475, 1, 3, 875402) Congress Ministers throughout the seven Provinces have given ample testimony of their readiness and ability to cope with forces of disorder.
('72', 475, 1, 4, 875543) The Congress stands more to lose than Government if during its regime in any Province disorders take place.
('72', 475, 1, 5, 875651) I understand that the Ministers in the Provinces concerned have, previously to asking for discharge of prisoners, assured themselves of the change of mentality of the prisoners.
('72', 475, 1, 6, 875829) Surely, it is they who according to law are in the first instance responsible for law and order.
('72', 475, 1, 7, 875926) The Governor and the whole weight of British might is always in reserve, if in spite of the efforts of the Congress Ministers disorders take place, with its well known efficiency in suppressing disorders when they actually take place.
('72', 475, 1, 8, 876161) Surely, there was no warrant whatsoever for interference with the deliberate decision of the Congress Ministers in the matter under discussion.
('72', 475, 1, 9, 876305) I cannot help thinking that the Ministers who have resigned have taken, under instruction from the Working Committee, the only honourable course open to them.

('72', 475, 4, 13, 876550) Gandhiji said that he could not understand the steps taken by the Governor General.
('72', 475, 4, 14, 876634) He said that it was just the kind of interference which he had dreaded on Congress acceptance of office and which fear had become justified by the recent events.
('72', 475, 4, 15, 876796) He therefore infers from this interference that possibly British authority is alarmed over the rapid progress the Congress is making in its constructive policy, and in the hold it is strengthening over people.
('72', 475, 4, 16, 877006) But surely that was only to be expected.
('72', 475, 4, 17, 877047) He hopes, however, that the interference is wholly unjustified and that though the crisis has been precipitated by the Governor General’s action, somehow or other the mischief done will be undone.
('72', 475, 4, 18, 877244) But it is of British making and the undoing has also to come from the British side.
('72', 475, 4, 19, 877328) By the marvellous manner in which Congress Ministers have embarked upon social and economic legislation, the Congress has given ample proof of its desire to seriously work its office programme.

('72', 476, 3, 6, 877984) The Congress Resolution 3 too should induce abandon ment of the strike.

('72', 476, 8, 14, 878317) He was extremely unhappy about it.
('72', 476, 8, 15, 878352) I think your speech was too aggressive.
('72', 476, 8, 16, 878392) The Socialists cannot be won over in this manner.

('72', 477, 2, 3, 879080) APPENDIX I
('72', 477, 3, 4, 879091) VICEROY’S SPEECH 1
('72', 477, 4, 5, 879110) June 21, 1937
('72', 477, 5, 6, 879124) I dare say you will recall that when I spoke to you by wireless on the day I took charge of the office as Viceroy, I gave you my view that we should be wise not to expect that constitutional changes as profound as those into which we have now entered could come about altogether without difficulty.
('72', 477, 5, 7, 879423) I want today to say a few words to you about those difficulties as they have emerged, and to try my utmost to make some contribution towards their final dissipation.
('72', 477, 5, 8, 879589) As you read this message I would ask you to bear in mind two things.
('72', 477, 5, 9, 879658) The first, that while I am truly anxious not to be more formal or technical than my task requires .
('72', 477, 5, 10, 879758) I should not attempt to shorten too much or to oversimplify the various matters I propose to discuss.
('72', 477, 5, 11, 879860) The second, that, even though .
('72', 477, 5, 12, 879892) my words may seem to you a little formal, this does not mean that my personal approach to these problems is in the least degree cold or unsymp athetic.
('72', 477, 6, 13, 880044) I have refrained hitherto from making any public statement of any sort on the constitutional issues which have been raised by the refusal of the party which commands a majority of the votes in the Legislatures to accept office in certain Provinces.
('72', 477, 6, 14, 880293) My decision to do so was deliberate.
('72', 477, 6, 15, 880330) A point has now, however, been reached at which it will, I think, be of advantage that, for the benefit of the man in the street and the ordinary elector, I should myself take up the threads of this discussion in the light of the statements which have been made in Parliament by the Secretary of State, and in individual Provinces by the Governors, and that I should state comprehensively, in the most formal and public manner open to me, my attitude, which is equally the attitude of the Secretary of State and of the Governor of every Province in India, on the consititutional issues which have been brought to the fore in connection with this question of office acceptance.
('72', 477, 7, 16, 881007) Three months ago a great political party which commanded in six Provinces a majority in the Legislature felt that, even with the support of the majority in the
('72', 477, 8, 17, 881167) 1 Vide “Letter to Manilal and Sushila Gandhi”, 21 7 1937, “Letter to Lord Lothian”, 24 7 1937 and “Speech at Working Committee Meeting Wardha”,6 7 1937 Only extracts are reproduced here.
('72', 478, 0, 1, 881354) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 479
('72', 478, 1, 2, 881398) Legislature, it could not wisely accept office under the provisions of the Act unless it received certain specific assurances from Governors.
('72', 478, 1, 3, 881540) Three months experience of the operation of the Constitution, short as I agree that that period is, has conclusively shown from the practical point of view that, any legal difficulties in regard to the grant of such assurances apart, those assurances are not essential to the smooth and harmonious working of the Constitution .
('72', 478, 1, 4, 881868) Those three months have shown equally and beyond question that the apprehensions—even if I see no foundation of fact for them—that Governors would seek occasions for interfering with the policy of their Ministers or for the gratuitous and uncalled for exercise of the Special Responsibilities imposed upon them by the Act to impede or challenge the Ministers in the day to day administration of the Province, have no shadow of justification.
('72', 478, 2, 5, 882310) I have been intimately associated with the framing of the present Constit ution .
('72', 478, 2, 6, 882392) The Act, and the Instrument of Instructions which must be read with the Act, have been approved by Parliament.
('72', 478, 2, 7, 882503) Taken together, they represent the intention of Parliament and the Instruction given by Parliament to Governors.
('72', 478, 2, 8, 882616) Those documents make it clear beyond any possibility of question that, under Provincial Autonomy, in all matters falling within the ministerial field, including the position of the Minorities, the Services, etc., the Governor will ordinarily be guided, in the exercise of his powers, by the advice of his Ministers and that those Ministers will be responsible not to Parliament but to the provincial Legislature.
('72', 478, 2, 9, 883029) The only qualifications of this rule are in respect of certain specific and clearly defined matters.
('72', 478, 2, 10, 883130) The most important of these are those known as the Special Responsibilities; and of those Special Responsibilities again, the most important are the prevention of any grave menace to the peace or tranquillity of the Province or any part of the Province, the safeguarding of the legitimate interests of the miniorities and the securing to the Services and their dependents of any rights provided or preserved for them under the Act and the safeguarding of their legitimate interests.
('72', 478, 3, 11, 883613) Within the limited area of his Special Responsibilities a Governor is directly answerable to Parliament, whether he accepts or does not accept the advice of his Ministers, But if the Governor is unable to accept the advice of his Ministers then the responsibility for the decision is his and his alone.
('72', 478, 3, 12, 883916) In that event Ministers bear no responsibility for the decision and are entitled—if they so desire—publicly to state that they take no responsibility for that particular decision or even that they have advised the Governor in an opposite sense.
('72', 478, 3, 13, 884161) But every Governor will be concerned to have the support of his Ministry or to know that he is not silghtly at variance with his Ministry .
('72', 478, 3, 14, 884301) He will listen with a mind open to conviction to the arguments on the other side.
('72', 478, 3, 15, 884383) If he regards those arguments as valid, he will modify his proposal .
('72', 478, 3, 16, 884453) on the other hand, as invalid, he will do his utmost, before taking a final decision, to convince the Minister or the Ministry of the soundness of the
('72', 479, 0, 1, 884604) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 480
('72', 479, 1, 2, 884646) reasons for which he is unable to accept his or their view and if, in these circumstances, he still remains unable to influence their views in the direction he desires, he will take his decision .
('72', 479, 1, 3, 884843) and, before passing it, he will have exhausted all methods of convincing his Ministry that that decision was the right one, given the obligation imposed upon him by the Act.
('72', 479, 2, 4, 885017) I welcome for this reason the helpful suggestion recently made by Mr. Gandhi that it is only when the issue between a Governor and his Ministers constitutes a serious disagreement that any question of the severing of their partnership need arise.
('72', 479, 2, 5, 885264) “Serious disagreement” is a pharse which it is possible to define and to interpret in various ways.
('72', 479, 2, 6, 885364) But the general sense is clear enough to anyone with any political or administrative experience.
('72', 479, 2, 7, 885461) The matter involved must be of such really major importance.
('72', 479, 2, 8, 885522) It must, I would myself say, be of such a character that a compromise was ruled out by a particular action taken against their advice by a Governor in the discharge of his responsibilities under the Act, despite the fact that Ministers had no direct or indirect responsibility for that action and that a Governor had taken the utmost pains to satisfy his Ministry that he had no choice in the discharge of his responsibilities but to take the action in question.
('72', 479, 2, 9, 885985) I readily agree that where, on such an issue arising and where the Governor and his Ministers have both approached the matter, as I am confident that they would with open minds and with a full sense of responsibility—the Governor, in so far as his Special Responsibiliies are concerned to Parliament, the Ministry to the provincial Legislature no agreement could be reached, then the Ministry must either resign or be dismissed.
('72', 479, 2, 10, 886414) As between resignation and dismissal, normal constitutional practice leans very heavily indeed to the side of resignation.
('72', 479, 2, 11, 886537) Resignation is more consistent with the self respect of a Ministry and is an effective public indication of the attitude of Ministers towards the action of a Governor.
('72', 479, 2, 12, 886705) Resignation equally is an act taken spontaneously by a Ministry.
('72', 479, 2, 13, 886770) Dismissal, more unusual by far in constitutional practice, might seem to carry with it some suggestion which we are concerned at any cost to eliminate from the new constitutional arrangements.
('72', 479, 2, 14, 886963) I ought perhaps to add that the suggestion that the Governor should in certain circumstances demand the resignation of his Ministers is not the solution provided by the Act, so that it will not be possible for Governors to accept it.
('72', 479, 2, 15, 887197) Both resignation and dismissal are possible, the former at the option of the Ministers and the latter at the option of the Governors.
('72', 479, 2, 16, 887331) But the Act does not contemplate that the Governor’s option should be used to force the Minister’s option and thus to shift the responsibility from himself.
('72', 479, 3, 17, 887488) I have deliberately dealt with the extreme case of a conflict involving resignation or dismissal, for it is the extreme case on which attention has been riveted.
('72', 479, 3, 18, 887650) I feel no doubt whatever myself that on that basis deadlocks need not be anticipated in view of the anxiety of all Governors, to which I can myself testify, not merely not to provoke conflicts with their Ministers, to whatever party their
('72', 480, 0, 1, 887889) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 481
('72', 480, 1, 2, 887933) Ministers may belong, but to leave nothing undone to avoid or to resolve such conflicts.
('72', 480, 1, 3, 888022) I have been the more concerned to set out in some detail the position, as I see it, in that it is essential that those interests or communities or areas to which the Act extends the assurance of the Special Responsibilities should not, for a moment, think, or have the least ground for thinking, that any question will arise of sacrificing their interests for political reason.
('72', 480, 1, 4, 888400) What I am concerned to make clear is that, without any threat to those interests or any sacrifice of them, a Governor and his Ministers can, in my judgment, hope, within the provision of the Act, to operate the Constitution in the normal manner which the Act envisages and to avoid, save in circumstances which I find it not easy to contemplate, fundamental differences of opinion such as to endanger the relation between the Governor and his Ministry in that very limited area in which special obligations and responsibilities are imposed upon a Governor.
('72', 480, 2, 5, 888957) Before I take leave of you, I feel that you would wish me, setting aside all technicalities, to speak to you for a moment or two as one who has had a good deal of Parliamentary experience and some share in the shaping of the new Constitution.
('72', 480, 2, 6, 889200) Some of you, I know, hold and hold strongly, that the plan of reform does not go sufficiently far in the direction of complete self government.
('72', 480, 2, 7, 889344) I do not question the sincerity with which that view is held.
('72', 480, 2, 8, 889406) But I am certain that every responsible person, in deciding his position on this vital matter does so with a genuine anxiety in the best interests of India to take a balanced view and to reach a right decision as to what may best be done in the conditions of this time to serve those interests.
('72', 480, 3, 9, 889701) Let me at once assure you that in my best judgment and given goodwill on all sides this Constitution will work and that in experience it will be found to work well.
('72', 480, 3, 10, 889866) It stands now as the law of the land.
('72', 480, 3, 11, 889904) It stands too—and despite all the criticism that has been levelled against it—as the only complete and homogeneous scheme of political reform now before the country.
('72', 480, 3, 12, 890070) I am convinced that the shortest road to that fuller political life which many of you so greatly desire is to accept this constitution and to work it for all it is worth.
('72', 480, 3, 13, 890241) Of their nature, politics are ever dynamic and to imagine that their expression in terms of a written Constitution can render them static would be utterly to disregard the lessons of history and indeed the dictates of common sense.
('72', 480, 3, 14, 890473) Again, it is my firm conviction that this Constitution will be found to offer immense opportunities for beneficent public service and in this connection I may venture a word upon a matter very close to my heart.
('72', 480, 3, 15, 890685) It is my conviction that in the full working and development of this Constitution lies the best hope for that general and lasting amelioration in the condition of the rural population and of the humbler sections of society which all of us so ardently desire.
('72', 480, 4, 16, 890944) The discussions and debates of the last two months have, I think, placed before you every argument and point of view that bear upon this issue.
('72', 480, 4, 17, 891088) The choice—a
('72', 481, 0, 1, 891101) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 482
('72', 481, 1, 2, 891143) choice fraught with so much of profound significance for the future of India—must shortly be made.
('72', 481, 1, 3, 891242) I hope with all my heart that all, whether leaders or their followers, may find it their duty to choose the way of constructive effort.
('72', 481, 1, 4, 891378) Whatever emerges, you may count upon me, in face even of bitter disappointment, to strive unstirringly towards the full and final establishment in India of the principles of parliamentary government.
('72', 481, 1, 5, 891578) But if what I should regard as deplorable outcome should emerge from the present situation and if parliamentary and responsible government should, as a consequence, be suspended in a number of Provinces, it might, however much we might all of us regret it, be beyond the power of any of us rapidly to reverse the circumstances that must then supervene.
('72', 481, 1, 6, 891931) In that event invaluable time will be lost, and I greatly fear, no little hurt inflicted upon the cause of progressive reform.
('72', 481, 2, 7, 892058) But I do not believe that these sad things will come to pass, for I have faith in you and in the destiny of India.
('72', 481, 2, 8, 892173) The way we tread may seem dark and sometimes difficult.
('72', 481, 2, 9, 892229) The star that guides our course may seem sometimes to flicker and almost to fall.
('72', 481, 2, 10, 892311) Yet faith and courage are mighty forces.
('72', 481, 2, 11, 892352) Let us summon them to our aid in this difficult hour and together move steadily towards the fulfilment of our hopes.

('72', 481, 6, 15, 892558) July 9, 1937
('72', 481, 7, 16, 892571) I have remained studiously silent regarding the unfortunate controversy that has been going on in the Press about the election of leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party in the Bombay Legislative Assembly.
('72', 481, 7, 17, 892780) I feel that the time has now come for me to make a brief statement for the information of the public.
('72', 481, 7, 18, 892882) Shri Nariman has suggested that I intervened in an unwarranted manner in the election of the leader.
('72', 481, 7, 19, 892983) He has persisted in this charge, although Gangadharrao Despande and Shankarrao Deo, the two individuals most concerned, have emphatically repudiated it.
('72', 481, 7, 20, 893136) As is well known, the bulk of the members of the Legislature have also repudiated the charge in writing.
('72', 481, 7, 21, 893241) I now say with a full sense of responsibility that I have never, directly or indirectly, influenced this election.
('72', 481, 7, 22, 893356) What happened was this: on the morning of the 4th of March, Nariman came to me and asked me for a private interview.
('72', 481, 7, 23, 893473) I readily agreed.
('72', 481, 7, 24, 893491) At his suggestion it was then arranged that we should go for a drive in the evening to Worli.
('72', 481, 7, 25, 893585) Accordingly he came and took me in his car to Worli.
('72', 481, 7, 26, 893638) He asked me to help him in the election.
('72', 481, 7, 27, 893679) I told him I could not do so for

('72', 482, 1, 2, 893840) reasons which I had already indicated to him.
('72', 482, 1, 3, 893886) At the same time, I also told him that I would not use my influence against him, or support anyone else.
('72', 482, 2, 4, 893991) Certain telegrams sent by me to Shri Gangadharrao Deshpande and Shri Shankarrao Deo have been quoted as proof of my intervention against Nariman.
('72', 482, 2, 5, 894137) Both Gangadharrao and Shankarrao have stated in unambiguons terms that the telegrams were not connected with the election of Nariman.
('72', 482, 2, 6, 894271) It is a matter of common knowledge that I have frequently entrusted Nariman with responsible tasks, which I felt he was the right person to discharge.
('72', 482, 2, 7, 894422) I have no personal grudge against him.
('72', 482, 3, 8, 894461) The suggestion that Nariman was not elected because he belonged to a minority community is false and malicious.
('72', 482, 3, 9, 894573) I am glad that Nariman has himself admitted that there was nothing communal in the matter.
('72', 482, 3, 10, 894664) Gangadharrao had informed Nariman on my behalf that if the allegations were to be investigated by a tribunal, I would abide by its award.

('72', 482, 6, 13, 894854) LIVERY OF FREEDOM 1
('72', 482, 7, 14, 894874) I suggest, therefore, that meetings for this purpose be held all over India, in towns and villages, on a particular day, Sunday, August 1st, when the Working Committe’s Resolution should be read out and explained and while offering camaraderie greeting to Congress Ministers, we should pledge ourselves anew to independence and removal of poverty of our people.
('72', 482, 7, 15, 895236) On that day also the flag salutation ceremony should be solemnly performed everywhere.
('72', 482, 7, 16, 895323) August 1st is a special significant day for us, the day dedicated to India’s freedom.
('72', 482, 7, 17, 895409) On that day seventeen years ago great Lokamanya passed away and on that very day India launched the non co operation movement and began wielding that weapon which has strengthened and vitalized our people so greatly.
('72', 482, 7, 18, 895626) It is fitting, therefore, that this day be suitably celebrated and we should remember the past and we should look to the future with the same determination which has held us for so long.
('72', 482, 8, 19, 895813) I trust that as an earnest of his sympathy and goodwill every Indian who stands for India’s freedom will wear khadi, the livery of our freedom, and will display and honour the National Flag.
('72', 482, 8, 20, 896004) I trust also that the police force, which has so long been hostile to our people, will think in terms of India and not of alien masters and will seek the co operation and goodwill of the masses.
('72', 482, 8, 21, 896199) Congress Ministries, if they mean anything at all, mean that the interests of these masses will be dominant.

('72', 483, 2, 3, 896429) THE QUESTION OF LANGUAGES 1
('72', 483, 3, 4, 896457) 1. Our public work should be carried on and State education should be given in the language of each linguistic area.
('72', 483, 3, 5, 896574) This language should be the dominant language in that area.
('72', 483, 3, 6, 896634) These Indian languages to be recognised officially for this purpose are: Hindustani (both Hindi and Urdu), Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Assamese, Sindhi, and to some extent, Pushtu and Punjabi.
('72', 483, 4, 7, 896869) 2. In the Hindustani speaking area both Hindi and Urdu, with their scripts, should be officially recognized.
('72', 483, 4, 8, 896978) Public notifications should be issued in both scripts.
('72', 483, 4, 9, 897033) Either script might be used by a person in addressing a court or a public office, and he should not be called upon to supply a copy in the other script.
('72', 483, 5, 10, 897186) 3. The medium of State instruction in the Hindustani area being Hindustani, both scripts will be recognized and used.
('72', 483, 5, 11, 897304) Each pupil or his parents will make a choice of scripts.
('72', 483, 5, 12, 897361) A pupil will not be compelled to learn both scripts but may be encouraged to do so in the secondary stage.
('72', 483, 6, 13, 897468) 4. Hindustani (both scripts) will be recognized as the all India language.
('72', 483, 6, 14, 897543) As such it will be open to any person throughout India to address a court or public office in Hindustani (either script) without any obligation to give a copy in another script or language.
('72', 483, 7, 15, 897733) 5. An attempt should be made to unify the Devanagari, Bengali, Gujarati and Marathi scripts and to produce a composite script suited to printing, typing and the use of modern mechanical devices.
('72', 483, 8, 16, 897928) 6. The Sindhi script should be absorbed in the Urdu script which should be simplified, to the extent that is possible, and suited to printing, typing, etc.
('72', 483, 9, 17, 898084) 7. The possibility of approximating the southern scripts to Devanagari should be explored.
('72', 483, 9, 18, 898175) If that is not considered feasible, then an attempt should be made to have a common script for the southern languages—Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam.
('72', 483, 10, 19, 898331) 8. It is not possible for us to think in terms of the Latin script for our languages, for the present at least, in spite of the various advantages which that script possesses.
('72', 483, 10, 20, 898507) We must thus have two scripts: the composite Devanagari Bengali Gujarati Marathi; and the Urdu Sindhi; and if necessary, a script for the southern languages, unless this can be approximated to the first.

('72', 484, 0, 1, 898769) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 485
('72', 484, 1, 2, 898813) 9. The tendency for Hindi and Urdu in the Hindustani speaking area to diverge and develop separately need not be viewed with alarm, nor should any obstruction be placed in the development of either.
('72', 484, 1, 3, 899012) This is to some extent natural as new and more abstruse ideas come into the language.
('72', 484, 1, 4, 899098) The development of either will enrich the language.
('72', 484, 1, 5, 899150) There is bound to be an adjustment later on as world forces and nationalism press in this direction, and mass education will bring a measure of standardization and uniformity.
('72', 484, 2, 6, 899326) 10. We should lay stress on the language (Hindi, Urdu, as well as the other Indian languages) looking to the masses and speaking in terms of them.
('72', 484, 2, 7, 899473) Writers should write for the masses in simple language understood by them, and they should deal with problems affecting the masses.
('72', 484, 2, 8, 899605) Courtly and affected style and flowery phrases should be discouraged and a simple, vigorous style developed.
('72', 484, 2, 9, 899714) Apart from its other advantages, this will also lead to uniformity between Hindi and Urdu.
('72', 484, 3, 10, 899805) 11. A Basic Hindustani should be evolved out of Hindustani on the lines of Basic English.
('72', 484, 3, 11, 899895) This should be a simple language with very little grammar and a vocabulary of about a thousand words.
('72', 484, 3, 12, 899997) It must be a complete language, good enough for all ordinary speech and writing, and yet within the framework of Hindustani and a stepping stone for the further study of that language.
('72', 484, 4, 13, 900182) 12. Apart from Basic Hindustani, we should fix upon scientific, technical, political and commercial words to be used in Hindustani (both Hindi and Urdu) as well as, if possible, in other Indian languages.
('72', 484, 4, 14, 900387) Where necessary these words should be taken from foreign languages and bodily adopted.
('72', 484, 4, 15, 900474) Lists of other words from our own languages should be made, so that in all technical and suchlike matters we might have a precise and uniform vocabulary.
('72', 484, 5, 16, 900628) 13. The policy governing State education should be that education is to be given in the language of the student.
('72', 484, 5, 17, 900741) In each linguistic area education from the primary to the university stage will be given in the language of the province.
('72', 484, 5, 18, 900863) Even within a linguistic area, if there are a sufficient number of students whose mother tongue is some other Indian language, they will be entitled to receive primary education in their mother tongue, provided they are easily accessible from a convenient centre.
('72', 484, 5, 19, 901127) It may also be possible, if the number is large enough, to give them secondary education also in the mother tongue, but all such students will have to take, as a compulsory subject, the language of the linguistic area they live in.
('72', 484, 6, 20, 901359) 14. In the non Hindustani speaking areas, Basic Hindustani should be taught in the secondary stage, the script being left to the choice of the person concerned.
('72', 484, 7, 21, 901520) 15. The medium of instruction for university education will be the language of the linguistic area.
('72', 484, 7, 22, 901620) Hindustani (either script) and a foreign language should be compulsory subjects.
('72', 484, 7, 23, 901701) This compulsion of learning additional languages need not
('72', 485, 0, 1, 901759) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 486
('72', 485, 1, 2, 901801) apply to higher technical courses, though a knowledge of languages is desirable even there.
('72', 485, 2, 3, 901893) 16. Provision for teaching foreign languages, as well as our classical languages, should be made in our secondary schools, but the subjects should not be compulsory, except for certain special courses, or for preparation for the university stage.
('72', 485, 3, 4, 902140) 17. Translations should be made of a considerable number of classical and modern works in foreign literatures into the Indian languages, so that our languages might develop contact with the cultural, literary and social movements in other countries, and gain strength thereby.

('72', 485, 6, 7, 902447) THE KOTTAPATAM SUMMER SCHOOL 1
('72', 485, 7, 8, 902478) While I was in Malaya I read a brief report in the papers of the Madras Government’s ban on the Summer School at Kottapatam and the subsequent lathi charge on the students.
('72', 485, 7, 9, 902651) Such a step would have been surprising and reprehensible even during the course of the civil disobedience movement.
('72', 485, 7, 10, 902767) At the present moment it came as a shock to me.
('72', 485, 7, 11, 902815) Since my return I have looked further into the matter and the sense of astonishment and shock has not lessened.
('72', 485, 7, 12, 902927) This incident has illuminated, as by a flash of lightning, the real nature of the new Constitution and the way the Madras Ministry is functioning, for it is this Ministry that is obviously responsible for the steps taken.
('72', 485, 7, 13, 903149) We see that this Ministry is as much a police ministry suppressing elementary rights of free speech and association as the previous Government was.
('72', 485, 7, 14, 903297) We see what the new Act means to the people.
('72', 485, 7, 15, 903342) The same intolerable state of affairs continues and all the soft words thrown out at us cannot stop the aggressive suppression of civil liberty or the use of the lathi on the bodies of our youth.
('72', 485, 7, 16, 903538) The lathi remains still under the new Ministers as it was before the true symbol of Government.
('72', 485, 8, 17, 903634) Some other important considerations arise.
('72', 485, 8, 18, 903677) The police reporters tried to force entry into the Summer School.
('72', 485, 8, 19, 903743) Very rightly this was objected to.
('72', 485, 8, 20, 903778) We have been giving facilities to police reporters at our public meetings but this does not mean that we admit their right to attend our committee meetings and summer schools and the like.
('72', 485, 8, 21, 903967) This cannot be agreed to.
('72', 485, 8, 22, 903993) Summer schools for the study of political and economic problems have been held in many places in India.
('72', 485, 8, 23, 904097) This is a healthy development which I trust will continue, for only by study and discussions can we understand our problems and find the way to their solution.
('72', 485, 9, 24, 904257) Another question that arises is the right of an individual or group to refuse to obey an order which it considers objectionable.
('72', 485, 9, 25, 904386) It is patent that civil disobedience

('72', 486, 1, 2, 904513) having been suspended disobedience of orders is not desirable.
('72', 486, 1, 3, 904576) Where such objectionable orders are made reference should immediately be made to superior committees for advice.
('72', 486, 1, 4, 904689) But sometimes cases arise when immediate decisions have to be made and the burden of such decision must lie on the individual or group concerned and cannot commit the organization.
('72', 486, 1, 5, 904870) I can conceive of instances of orders which are so derogatory to the dignity of the individual or of the Congress that the individual prefers to disobey them on his own responsibility.
('72', 486, 1, 6, 905055) This has nothing to do with civil disobedience.
('72', 486, 1, 7, 905103) It is the inherent right of an individual.
('72', 486, 1, 8, 905146) This right however must be exercised with every care and so as not to injure the large purposes we have in view, and the individual must take the risk of being judged by the organization.

('72', 486, 6, 13, 905494) DEAR MR. GANDHI,
('72', 486, 7, 14, 905511) I have received a letter from His Excellency the Viceroy in which he has given me the gist of his talk with you on the 4th of August.
('72', 486, 7, 15, 905645) His Excellency, I understood, told you that he believed there would be no objection to your paying a visit to the North West Frontier Province, should you desire to do so.
('72', 486, 7, 16, 905817) I have discussed this with my Ministers, and with their authority I write to inform you that there will be no objection to your visiting the Province.
('72', 486, 7, 17, 905968) His Excellency, I know, told you that he felt it necessary to ask you to leave all affairs connected with the tribes severely alone during your visit; I understand that you accepted His Excellency’s decision in this matter, and I know that you will scrupulously abide by this assurance.
('72', 486, 8, 18, 906255) Should there be an opportunity of our meeting, it will be a pleasure to me to renew the acquaintance we made when I was with Lord Halifax.
('72', 486, 9, 19, 906394) The question of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, about which you also spoke to His Excellency, is still under consideration by the Ministry; I anticipate that a decision will be reached within the next day or two.

('72', 487, 2, 3, 906814) CONGRESS WORKING COMMITTEE RESOLUTION ON ANDAMANS PRISONERS 1
('72', 487, 3, 4, 906876) The Working Committee has learnt with the deepest concern of the hunger strike of hundreds of political prisoners in the Andaman Islands.
('72', 487, 3, 5, 907014) The Committee has long been of opinion that the use of the Islands as a penal settlement, more especially for political prisoners, is barbarous.
('72', 487, 3, 6, 907159) Official enquiries and reports have already condemned such use and non official opinion has unanimously demanded that no prisoners be sent there.
('72', 487, 3, 7, 907305) Repeated hunger strikes by the political prisoners have demonstrated their desperation at the continuance of conditions which they cannot bear, and the present hunger strike has brought matters to a head and grave consequences are feared.
('72', 487, 3, 8, 907544) Public opinion all over India is agitated and strongly in favour of the release of the political prisoners there as they have already undergone many years of imprisonment under conditions which are far worse than those prevailing in Indian prisons.
('72', 487, 3, 9, 907793) The Committee’s attention has been drawn to the public statement issued by some ex prisoners, who were till recently imprisoned in the Andaman Islands and have been now released, in which they have stated on their own behalf and on behalf of the other political prisoners there, their dissociation from and disapproval of the policy of terrorism.
('72', 487, 3, 10, 908140) They have frankly stated that they have come to realize that such a policy is wrong and injurious to the national cause and they propose to have nothing to do with it.
('72', 487, 3, 11, 908308) This statement has been confirmed from other sources also.
('72', 487, 4, 12, 908367) In view of all these circumstances the Committee is emphatically of opinion that the political prisoners in the Andamans should be discharged.
('72', 487, 4, 13, 908510) The Committee is further of opinion that the non political prisoners in the Andamans should be repatriated and the penal settlement in the islands closed.
('72', 487, 4, 14, 908665) Any delay in taking adequate action is likely to lead to alarming consequences.
('72', 487, 5, 15, 908745) The Committee appeals to the prisoners in the Andamans to give up their hunger strike.

('72', 488, 2, 3, 909044) NOTES “SUFFICIENTLY ACQUAINTED” 1
('72', 488, 3, 4, 909078) The very first question on which our Assembly Speakers may have to give their ruling will be what, in their opinion, is the meaning of “sufficient acquaintance” with English.
('72', 488, 3, 5, 909253) For one of the most objectionable Sections of the Government of India Act, 1935, is Section 85, which reads:
('72', 488, 4, 6, 909362) “All proceedings in the Legislature of a Province shall be conducted in the English language.
('72', 488, 5, 7, 909456) Provided that the rules of procedure of the chamber or chambers, and the rules, if any, with respect to joint sittings, shall provide for enabling persons unacquainted, or not sufficiently acquainted, with the English language, to use another language.”
('72', 488, 6, 8, 909710) The first part of the Section is eloquently emphatic of the fact that the Act was meant not for the millions unacquainted with the English language but for the very few acquainted with it.
('72', 488, 6, 9, 909899) The insult to the millions is so obvious.
('72', 488, 6, 10, 909941) The permissive proviso offers a kind of healing balm to the injury of the insult.
('72', 488, 6, 11, 910023) In an Act framed by our own people the operative part of the Section would make the use of the language of the province or Hindi Hindustani obligatory and the permissive proviso would be for the benefit of the unfortunate ones who might not know either the language of the province or the nation, and therefore must use “another language”.
('72', 488, 6, 12, 910363) That, of course, is by way of comment on the Section.
('72', 488, 7, 13, 910417) Those, however, who occupy the Speaker’s chair cannot comment on the Section, they will have to interpret it for the members.
('72', 488, 7, 14, 910543) A commentator of the Act has already anticipated a difficulty and says: “This is a facility (viz., the one offered by the proviso) not open to those who, knowing English, would, as a matter of national self respect, insist upon using the vernacular language.” We shall not quarrel with the commentator’s own ignorance, here, of the correct use of the English language, or of the implications of “national self respect”.
('72', 488, 7, 15, 910963) (Otherwise he would not have used the objectionable word “vernacular” and would have used the words “national language” or “the language of the province”).
('72', 488, 8, 16, 911119) But apart from the question of “national self respect” which is bound to be foreign to an Act, on the face of it so disrespectful, any commentator ought to address himself to the meaning of the words “sufficiently acquainted”.
('72', 488, 8, 17, 911346) Does “sufficient knowledge” mean a mere nodding acquaintance or even a working knowledge?
('72', 488, 8, 18, 911436) Whilst the Speaker may not be guided by “national self respect” and reverse the disrespectful

('72', 489, 1, 2, 911616) spirit of the Acts he may certainly put a liberal interpretation on the proviso.
('72', 489, 1, 3, 911697) “Sufficient” according to the Oxford Dictionary means “adequate, enough”; also “Competent, of adequate ability or resources”; and “adequate” means “proportionate to the requirements” of the case.
('72', 489, 1, 4, 911893) Now what are the requirements here?
('72', 489, 1, 5, 911929) Two, viz., that the member of the legislature may give adequate expression to all that he is filled with; and that the rest of the members understand all that he has to say.
('72', 489, 1, 6, 912103) As regards the first of these requirements, does an ordinary knowledge of English enable one to express one’s thoughts adequately?
('72', 489, 1, 7, 912234) As I write this, I have before my mind’s eye a vivid picture of a newly elected M. L. A. who had occasion to travel with Gandhiji some time ago.
('72', 489, 1, 8, 912379) The M. L. A., as we found afterwards, had a double University degree, but lacked, if I may say without offence, the ability to express her thought either fully or correctly.
('72', 489, 1, 9, 912553) She was exceptionally refined and cultured but she lacked this gift.
('72', 489, 1, 10, 912622) She not only could not express herself fully or correctly, she failed to follow Gandhiji fully or correctly.
('72', 489, 1, 11, 912731) Not knowing Section 85 of the Act, I said to myself, “Thank God she need not speak in the Assembly in English.” But knowing the Section, I now ask, must she speak in English, because she is a double graduate and presumed to know English?
('72', 489, 1, 12, 912969) I should think not.
('72', 489, 1, 13, 912989) It should be open to our M. L. A.s to declare that it is not possible for them to express themselves adequately in English, or at any rate as well in English as they could in their own mother tongue.
('72', 489, 1, 14, 913189) And this lady, in spite of her double degree, seemed to me to possess a right truthfully to make such a declaration.
('72', 489, 1, 15, 913306) I am sure that there are many members who are in the same case as this sister.
('72', 489, 2, 16, 913385) Take now the second and equally important requirement of the case, viz., that the rest of the members should understand all that a member says.
('72', 489, 2, 17, 913529) In Bombay, I am told, no less than twenty two of the members of the Assembly do not know English at all.
('72', 489, 2, 18, 913634) Are they to sit with their ears closed when a brother member addresses them in choice or indifferent English?
('72', 489, 2, 19, 913744) The least they are entitled to, I think, is that whenever a member regarding himself as “sufficiently acquainted” with English speaks in English, he must also for the benefit of the non English knowing members explain the speech in the language of the province.
('72', 489, 3, 20, 914006) These two requirements of the case seem to me so obvious that any Speaker seeking to put a correct, not to say liberal, interpretation on the proviso is bound to have due regard to them.

('72', 490, 3, 4, 914296) I am grateful to Mahatma Gandhi and D. N. Bahadurji for having taken me into their confidence and shown me a copy of their findings and judgment in an inquiry made by them.
('72', 490, 3, 5, 914469) I have studied them carefully and must accept them as findings arrived at by judges who were judges of my choice and whom I have the privilege of regarding as my friends.
('72', 490, 3, 6, 914640) It is open to them to publish their judgment but they have generously offered not to publish it if I publicly declare that I am satisfied with their verdict.
('72', 490, 3, 7, 914798) I accordingly do so and feel that in doing so I owe a statement to the public.
('72', 490, 4, 8, 914877) I am convinced that in the matter of the election of 1934 I neglected my duty as a responsible office bearer of the Congress and gave some of my friends cause to feel that my neglect amounted to a grave breach of trust.
('72', 490, 4, 9, 915097) In the matter of election of the leader of the Bombay Parliamentary Party in 1937, I am sorry to confess that I misjudged the general position and on the strength of the statement made by some of the legislators I felt a grievance which I allowed my friends and part of the Press to share with me.
('72', 490, 4, 10, 915395) As a result, considerable bitterness was aroused and Sardar Vallabhbhai was even charged by a section of the Press with having acted through communal prejudice.
('72', 490, 4, 11, 915556) I have publicly stated before and do so now that this charge was entirely unfounded and whatever the Sardar did or did not do, was from a sense of public duty.
('72', 490, 4, 12, 915716) I am sorry that the agitation against Sardar should have taken a personal aspect and even a communal aspect and that I should have been the cause of taking up so much of the time of Mahatma Gandhi and Bahadurji over a grievance which the public have a right to say was more fancied than real.
('72', 490, 5, 13, 916009) Having said this I feel that I owe some kind of reparation to the public whom I have all these years claimed to serve.
('72', 490, 5, 14, 916128) And in order that the confidence in me may be fully restored, I deliberately declare my intention not to seek on the expiry of my term of those offices re election to all positions and places of trust that I now enjoy and my determination to serve the Congress and the public by being out of those offices in order that passions and bitterness may cease and peace and harmony may be restored.

('72', 491, 3, 4, 916791) October 15, 1937
('72', 491, 4, 5, 916808) The Muslim League stands for full national democratic self government for India.
('72', 491, 4, 6, 916889) A great deal of capital is made as to phrases, more for the consumption of the ignorant and illiterate masses.
('72', 491, 4, 7, 917000) Various phrases are used such as purna swaraj, self government, complete independence, responsible government, substance of independence and dominion status.
('72', 491, 4, 8, 917158) There are some who talk of complete independence.
('72', 491, 4, 9, 917208) But it is no use having complete independence on your lips and the Government of India Act, 1935, in your hands.
('72', 491, 4, 10, 917321) Those who talk of complete independence the most mean the least what it means.
('72', 491, 4, 11, 917400) Was the Gandhi Irwin Pact in consonance with complete independence?
('72', 491, 4, 12, 917468) Were the assurances that were required before the offices would be accepted and the provincial constitutions could be worked consistent with purna swaraj, and was the resolution, after the assurances were refused, accepting offices and working the Constitution enacted by the British Parliament and forced upon the people of India by the imperialistic power, in keeping with the policy and programme and the declarations of the Congress Party?
('72', 491, 4, 13, 917912) Does wrecking mean working?
('72', 491, 5, 14, 917940) The present leadership of the Congress, especially during the last ten years, has been responsible for alienating the Mussalmans of India more and more by pursuing a policy which is exclusively Hindu, and since they have formed the governments in six provinces where they are in majority they have by their words, deeds and programmes shown more that the Mussalmans cannot expect any justice or fair play at their hands.
('72', 491, 5, 15, 918361) Wherever they are in a majority and wherever it suited them, they refused to co operate with the Muslim League Parties and demanded unconditional surrender and signing of their pledges.
('72', 491, 6, 16, 918547) Hindi is to be the national language of India and Bandemataram is to be the national song and is to be forced upon all.
('72', 491, 6, 17, 918667) The Congress flag is to be obeyed and revered by all and sundry.
('72', 491, 6, 18, 918732) On the very threshold of what little power and responsibility is given, the majority community have clearly shown their hand that Hindustan is for the Hindus; only, the Congress masquerades under the name of nationalism whereas the Hindu Mahasabha does not mince words.
('72', 491, 7, 19, 919002) Here it will not be out of place to state that the responsibility of the British Government is no less in the disastrous consequences which may issue.
('72', 491, 7, 20, 919153) It has been

('72', 492, 1, 2, 919288) clearly demonstrated that the Governor and Governor General who have been given the special powers and special responsibility to safeguard and protect the minorities under the Constitution which was made so much of by .
('72', 492, 1, 3, 919508) the Secretary of State for India .
('72', 492, 1, 4, 919543) have failed to use them and have thereby been a party to the flagrant breach of the spirit of the Constitution and the instrument of instructions in the matter of appointment of Muslim Ministers.
('72', 492, 1, 5, 919739) On the contrary they have been a party to passing off men as Muslim Ministers by appointing them as such, though they know fully well that they do not command the confidence of the Muslim representatives or the public outside.
('72', 492, 2, 6, 919966) The Congress High Command speaks in different voices.
('72', 492, 2, 7, 920020) One opinion is that there is no such thing as Hindu Muslim question and there is no such thing as minorities’ question in the country.
('72', 492, 2, 8, 920155) The other High Command opinion is that if a few crumbs are thrown to the Mussalmans in their present disorganized and helpless state you can manage them.
('72', 492, 3, 9, 920309) The All India Muslim League certainly and definitely stands to safeguard the rights and interests of the Mussalmans and other minorities effectively.
('72', 492, 3, 10, 920459) That is its basic and conditional principle.
('72', 492, 3, 11, 920504) The Congress attempt under the guise of establishing mass contact with the Mussalmans is calculated to divide and weaken and break the Mussalmans and is an effort to detach them from their accredited leaders.
('72', 492, 3, 12, 920713) It is a dangerous move and it cannot mislead anyone.
('72', 492, 3, 13, 920766) All such manoeuvres will not succeed notwithstanding the various blandishments, catchwords and slogans.
('72', 492, 4, 14, 920870) Then he warned the Congress against the inadvisibility of asking for a Constituent Assembly and admonished them to see that the All India Federation Scheme embodied in the 1935 Act was not brought into being.
('72', 492, 4, 15, 921079) He also warned the British empire against their attitude regarding Palestine and concluded by exhorting Mussalmans to fear nothing and to be true and loyal to stand by their decisions as one man.

('72', 492, 8, 19, 921370) DEAR MAHATMA GANDHI,
('72', 492, 9, 20, 921391) I have received your letter dated October 19, 1937, on my arrival here.
('72', 492, 9, 21, 921463) As regards publishing your letter from Teethal last May, I am of opinion that I was fully justified in doing so; but your letter means something different from what I understand it to mean.
('72', 492, 9, 22, 921653) Surely, it was open to you to offer your explanation to the public.
('72', 492, 9, 23, 921721) The letter was not marked as it is usual to do so when its publication is not desired by the

('72', 493, 1, 2, 921900) writer, and my message to you was not private.
('72', 493, 1, 3, 921947) Even now you do not indicate how I have misunderstood your attitude or the contents of that letter.
('72', 493, 1, 4, 922047) You merely say “I felt deeply hurt over your misunderstanding my attitude”.
('72', 493, 2, 5, 922123) I am sorry you think my speech at Lucknow is a declaration of war.
('72', 493, 2, 6, 922190) It is purely in self defence.
('72', 493, 2, 7, 922220) Kindly read it again and try and understand it.
('72', 493, 2, 8, 922268) Evidently, you have not been following the course of events of the last twelve months.
('72', 493, 2, 9, 922355) As to reserving you as a “bridge” and “peace maker”, don’t you think your complete silence for all these months has identified you with the Congress leadership although I know that you are not even a four anna member of that body?
('72', 493, 3, 10, 922586) In conclusion, I regret to say that I find nothing definite or any constructive proposal in your letter under reply, except that it is written in all good faith and out of an anguished heart, which I reciprocate.

('72', 493, 9, 16, 922903) November 14, 1937
('72', 493, 10, 17, 922921) MY DEAR BAPU,
('72', 493, 11, 18, 922935) I have just read your article on the A. I. C. C. meeting.
('72', 493, 11, 19, 922993) Regarding the Mysore resolution you have said that it was ultra vires of the A. I. C. C. If this was so then I had no business to permit discussion on it and should have banned it.
('72', 493, 11, 20, 923174) I am not aware of any constitutional provision which leads to this result and only something in the nature of such a provision can bar a resolution moved in the ordinary way and supported by a majority of the A. I. C. C. Apart from the constitution itself, I am not aware of any previous decision of the Congress or the A. I. C. C. which lays down that such matters should not be considered.
('72', 493, 11, 21, 923566) Even if there was some such resolution, I do not see how it could prevent the A. I. C. C. from considering a matter if it so chose, unless the resolution was embodied in a rule of practice.
('72', 493, 11, 22, 923756) The A. I. C. C. is at complete liberty to consider a resolution which may go contrary to a previous resolution passed by itself.
('72', 493, 11, 23, 923885) If however there is a rule of practice or procedure, this has to be acted upon till the A. I. C. C. does not alter it [sic].
('72', 493, 11, 24, 924010) There is no question of such a rule, but I do not even know of a resolution which lays down a policy which the Mysore resolution infringes.
('72', 493, 11, 25, 924150) In statements issued by us in the past mention has been made that the Congress desires to follow a policy of non intervention in the States.
('72', 493, 12, 26, 924291) 1 Vide “The A.I.C.C.”,13 11 1937
('72', 494, 0, 1, 924324) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 495
('72', 494, 1, 2, 924368) Those statements cannot bar the A. I. C. C. itself from intervening if it chooses.
('72', 494, 1, 3, 924451) I cannot understand how the legal phrase, ultra vires, can be made to apply.
('72', 494, 2, 4, 924528) Another question arises, what is intervention?
('72', 494, 2, 5, 924575) Is a mention of a State in a resolution intervention?
('72', 494, 2, 6, 924629) Is a demand for civil liberties or a condemnation of repression, intervention?
('72', 494, 2, 7, 924708) If so, the Congress itself has been guilty of it in specific and unequivocal terms during the last two years.
('72', 494, 3, 8, 924818) The Mysore resolution of the A. I. C. C. is very badly worded and, in any event, I did not want it to be passed by the A. I. C. C. just then.
('72', 494, 3, 9, 924960) But my feelings have little to do with the matter.
('72', 494, 3, 10, 925011) I have to act as the president of a democratic assembly.
('72', 494, 3, 11, 925068) The resolution was one of condemnation of repression in Mysore.
('72', 494, 3, 12, 925132) Are we to refrain from condemning repression in a State in future whatever the nature of this repression?
('72', 494, 3, 13, 925238) If this repression consists in attacking the Congress itself, insulting our Flag, or banning our organization, are we to remain silent?
('72', 494, 3, 14, 925374) These matters must be cleared up so that our office and our organization might know definitely what line we are to take up.
('72', 494, 4, 15, 925498) You have said that the A. I. C. C. should not have passed the resolution without at least hearing the other side.
('72', 494, 4, 16, 925612) Do you think that it is feasible for us to appoint inquiry committees to go to States?
('72', 494, 4, 17, 925699) Will the States agree?
('72', 494, 4, 18, 925722) on several occasions I have suggested this to States—not a committee but just an individual to go there and inquire from both sides.
('72', 494, 4, 19, 925855) They have invariably turned this down.
('72', 494, 5, 20, 925894) This Mysore matter has been going on for a long time.
('72', 494, 5, 21, 925948) The Karnatak P. C. C. has taken some steps in the matter.
('72', 494, 5, 22, 926006) Their secretary has had a long interview with the Dewan of Mysore.
('72', 494, 5, 23, 926073) I have repeatedly written to the Dewan and put a large number of specific cases before him.
('72', 494, 5, 24, 926165) He has replied at length without, in my opinion, justifying the State policy.
('72', 494, 5, 25, 926243) For months past I have been restraining Congressmen in Mysore from indulging in any disobedience of orders and, in fact, no orders have been disobeyed, except by Nariman recently.
('72', 494, 5, 26, 926423) The Karnatak P. C. C. ultimately considered the situation and condemned the policy of repression in Mysore and asked us for further directions as to what they should do.
('72', 494, 5, 27, 926593) It is hardly correct therefore to say that the A. I. C. C. condemned anybody unheard or ex parte.
('72', 494, 5, 28, 926691) We pursued all the ordinary avenues open to us.
('72', 494, 6, 29, 926739) I am writing all this to you as I want to be clear in my own mind what our policy is.
('72', 494, 6, 30, 926825) You have censured the A. I. C. C. and me for the course we pursued.
('72', 494, 6, 31, 926893) I have not yet understood how and where I am wrong and so long as I do not understand it, I can hardly act otherwise.

('72', 495, 2, 3, 927157) BENGAL GOVERNMENT’S COMMUNIQUE 1
('72', 495, 3, 4, 927190) November 18, 1937 2
('72', 495, 4, 5, 927210) During the last session of the Provincial Legislature the Government of Bengal declared its policy of progressive release of detenus as the situation improved, and also gave an assurance that where adequate guarantees of good behaviour were forthcoming, any special cases would be separately considered.
('72', 495, 4, 6, 927514) In the then prevailing circumstances, Government considered that a wholesale release of over 2,000 detenus might lead to difficulties and possibly a recrudescence of violence.
('72', 495, 4, 7, 927690) Their policy of progressive release was enunciated in the Assembly on August 9 and was approved by the Chamber.
('72', 495, 4, 8, 927802) In pursuance of this policy a large number of persons have already been released and many others have been placed under modified forms of restriction.
('72', 495, 5, 9, 927953) There have since been observed definite indications of a change for the better in the general atmosphere.
('72', 495, 5, 10, 928059) Recent pronouncements by certain leaders also show that they are exerting themselves to discredit methods of violence.
('72', 495, 5, 11, 928178) Mr. Gandhi has also assured Government that he would do his best to improve the political situation in Bengal by preaching his cult of non violence and creating public opinion in favour of it.
('72', 495, 5, 12, 928371) He has also offered to meet detenus with the object of persuading them not to resort to or assist terrorism or other subversive activities in future.
('72', 495, 5, 13, 928521) In consideration of these circumstances and on a review of the present situation, Government have decided to accelerate the release of the detenus or the removal of restrictions on them, and have therefore issued orders for the immediate release of about 1,100 detenus subject only to the requirement that changes of address be communicated.
('72', 495, 6, 14, 928863) As regards the remaining detenus, no more than 450 in number, a large portion of whom are in camps and jails, Government propose to take up their cases in the near future.
('72', 495, 6, 15, 929035) Mr. Gandhi has offered to interview individual detenus, a task which he intends to undertake in about four months’ time and for which Government will gladly afford him every facility.
('72', 495, 6, 16, 929219) Government hopes then to be in a position to grant immediate release to those detenus in respect of whom Mr. Gandhi may be able to give Government satisfactory assurances after seeing the individual detenus.
('72', 495, 6, 17, 929427) In the mean while Government will continue to consider relaxation in individual cases and, if such action appears to be justified, complete release.
('72', 495, 7, 18, 929576) It is hoped that the steady development of the policy now set forth will result in the ultimate solution of this perplexing and difficult problem.
('72', 495, 7, 19, 929723) Its success must, however, depend on the co operation of the public and the leaders of public opinion

('72', 496, 1, 2, 929967) in maintaining an atmosphere in which subversive movements will find no encouragement.
('72', 496, 1, 3, 930054) Government, who have throughout been most anxious to carry out the policy of release of detenus as rapidly as possible consistently with the public safety, cordially welcome Mr. Gandhi’s offer of assistance in creating the favourable atmosphere that is essential for the success of this policy.

('72', 496, 5, 7, 930435) MAGANWADI, WARDHA,
('72', 496, 6, 8, 930454) November 19, 1937
('72', 496, 7, 9, 930472) MY DEAR JAWAHARBHAI,
('72', 496, 8, 10, 930493) Your letter of the 8th.
('72', 496, 8, 11, 930517) I understand all that you say about Samuel’s visit, and I am writing to Polak to say that you will gladly meet him if he desires to see you.
('72', 496, 9, 12, 930658) About Anupchand Shah’s offer it was so good of you to have written to him about the existence of the Gandhi Seva Sangh.
('72', 496, 9, 13, 930778) I am now writing to him.
('72', 496, 10, 14, 930803) Bapu would himself have replied to your letter of the 14th regarding his article 2 on the Mysore Resolution.
('72', 496, 10, 15, 930912) But he was unable even to dictate his reply.
('72', 496, 10, 16, 930957) He is so thoroughly washed out that the doctors think that it would be dangerous to allow him to exert himself.
('72', 496, 10, 17, 931069) But I gave him the gist of your letter.
('72', 496, 10, 18, 931109) He told me that he was clear that there was an infringement of the policy of non intervention.
('72', 496, 10, 19, 931204) He knows that the Congress has been guilty of intervention in the past, but he also knows that it was not proper, and he should not have written the article if he did not feel it imperative to cry a halt.
('72', 496, 10, 20, 931409) He was glad you recognize that the resolution was badly worded and he is sure that if the other members of the Working Committee had taken care to invite your attention to the fact that the Resolution was ultra vires, you would have effectively prevented the speeches to the resolution which were much worse than the resolution itself.
('72', 496, 10, 21, 931745) Bapu wants me to assure you that he never intended to censure you.
('72', 496, 10, 22, 931812) You were immersed to the ears in work, and it was the duty of your colleagues on the W. C. to have drawn your attention.
('72', 496, 10, 23, 931933) You are too good a disciplinarian to have disregarded their advice, but he feels that they failed in their duty.
('72', 496, 11, 24, 932046) This cold blunt language of mine fails to convey the feeling at the back of Bapu’s mind.
('72', 496, 11, 25, 932135) He was very deeply exercised over the resolution on the day of that breakdown 3 and he seemed to me to be in the same state as he was talking about the matter today.
('72', 496, 11, 26, 932301) I stopped him and said I should convey to you what he thought about it as best as I could.

('72', 497, 1, 2, 932529) The blood pressure has been behaving so erratically that the doctors think he ought not to be allowed to take liberties with himself.
('72', 497, 1, 3, 932663) He wanted to go to Calcutta within a fortnight, but he himself recognizes that this is physically impossible.
('72', 497, 1, 4, 932773) He has promised to stay in bed at any rate until the pressure keeps steady for a fortnight or more.

('72', 497, 6, 8, 932961) MAGANWADI, WARDHA, December 2, 1937
('72', 497, 7, 9, 932997) MY DEAR JAWAHARBHAI.
('72', 497, 8, 10, 933018) I have your letter of the 27th.
('72', 497, 8, 11, 933050) It was a surprise to me that you had written at all, and all the greater surprise that you could write at such length.
('72', 497, 8, 12, 933169) I appreciate all that you say.
('72', 497, 8, 13, 933200) I simply did not inflict an argument on you as I assumed that you did not want an argument but simply Bapu’s opinion in the light of what you had urged in your letter.
('72', 497, 9, 14, 933368) There is no improvement in Bapu’s condition and we are withholding all correspondence from him.
('72', 497, 9, 15, 933464) But I decided that even in contravention of the doctors’ orders I must read out your letter to Bapu.
('72', 497, 9, 16, 933565) He was happy that I read it to him and if it had been at all possible for him to dictate a reply he would have done so.
('72', 497, 9, 17, 933685) But it was out of the question and I must try to tell you in my own language what was at the back of his mind when he wrote that the Mysore Resolution was ultra vires.
('72', 497, 9, 18, 933853) I wonder if you remember that Bapu said this very thing in the W. C. meeting too.
('72', 497, 9, 19, 933935) (He had that impression and on asking Jamnalalji he corroborated him.) And he had trusted that the resolution would not be allowed.
('72', 497, 9, 20, 934067) He was shocked when he found that it had been passed.
('72', 497, 10, 21, 934121) In your own letter you admit that the language of the resolution was bad.
('72', 497, 10, 22, 934195) But I suppose you will say that does not make it illegal.
('72', 497, 10, 23, 934253) Bapu thinks that it does inasmuch as it appeals to the people of British India to give all possible help to the people of Mysore.
('72', 497, 10, 24, 934383) If this does not go against the spirit and the letter of the Lucknow Resolution 2 what else does it do?
('72', 497, 10, 25, 934487) The Lucknow Resolution was arrived at after a good deal of discussion and deliberation, and reflected the declaration of policy made by Rajendra Babu on 1 8 1935 and adopted by the A. I. C. C. on 17 l0 1935. The relevant paragraph in this declaration was this: “It should be understood however that
('72', 497, 11, 26, 934786) 1 Vide “Letter to Mahadev Desai”, 22 11 1937 2 Passed at the Congress Session held in April 1936
('72', 498, 0, 1, 934883) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 499
('72', 498, 1, 2, 934927) the responsibility and the burden of carrying on that struggle with the States must necessarily fall on the States people themselves.
('72', 498, 1, 3, 935061) The Congress can exercise moral and friendly influence upon the States and this it is bound to do wherever possible.
('72', 498, 1, 4, 935178) The Congress has no other power under existing circumstances, although the people of India whether under the British, the Princes or any other power are geographically and historically one and indivisible.
('72', 498, 1, 5, 935384) In the heat of controversy the limitation of the Congress is often forgotten.
('72', 498, 1, 6, 935462) Indeed any other policy will defeat the common purpose.”
('72', 498, 2, 7, 935519) Now this declaration was but a reiteration of the policy that was being followed until then, and the Lucknow Resolution in laying down in the clearest possible terms that “the struggle for liberty within the States has, in the very nature of things, to be carried on by the people of the States themselves”, gave that declaration the status of a Congress enactment.
('72', 498, 2, 8, 935885) The sponsors of the Mysore Resolution forgot the self imposed limitation of the Congress and went against the spirit of the long accepted policy of the Congress.
('72', 498, 3, 9, 936047) I come now to your other question.
('72', 498, 3, 10, 936082) You say: “Bapu also refers to a violation of truth and non violence by the A. I. C. C. resolutions.
('72', 498, 3, 11, 936182) These are grave charges and should be substantiated,” and so on.
('72', 498, 3, 12, 936247) Naturally, when you were writing this, Bapu’s article was not before you.
('72', 498, 3, 13, 936321) The resolution (Masani’s) and the speeches were, he has said, “wide of the mark”.
('72', 498, 3, 14, 936403) He explains how they were wide of the mark, and then asks them “to study and take to heart what Jawaharlal Nehru has said in his elaborate statement on the matter.” Then follows the sentence: “I am convinced that in their action the critics departed from truth and non violence.” This is said more with reference to the speeches than the resolution itself.
('72', 498, 3, 15, 936760) You yourself had to pull up several speakers and ask them to confine themselves to principle and policy.
('72', 498, 3, 16, 936865) “Many political prisoners had been released and bans lifted,” said Mr. Masani, “but there are still some prisoners in the Congress provinces.” Is that enough to prove that the Ministers were identifying themselves with Imperialism or they were as bad as Haqs and Sikandar Hayat Khans?
('72', 498, 3, 17, 937150) Is it true to say that the whole armoury of repression remained, when the Moplah Outrages Act was repealed within two months of the Congress Ministers’ accepting office?
('72', 498, 3, 18, 937320) I will not refer to the other speeches.
('72', 498, 4, 19, 937360) As regards the Mysore resolution, Bapu was of opinion that it was untruthful to characterize the policy of the Mysore State as repressive, when we deliberately went there and defied the law.
('72', 498, 4, 20, 937551) “Abominable repressive measures” and “keeping printed orders ready to be served on those who passed through the State” is not truthful language.
('72', 498, 5, 21, 937696) As to the rest of your letter, Bapu deeply appreciated all that you have to say.
('72', 498, 5, 22, 937777) There can be no question of your accepting anything from Bapu because it came from Bapu, and discipline can never mean “a meek acceptance of one’s own view of the matter [sic].”
('72', 498, 6, 23, 937955) I do not know whether you will have issued your statement to the Press ere this.
('72', 498, 6, 24, 938036) But if you have not, perhaps you would alter in parts in the light of
('72', 499, 0, 1, 938106) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 500
('72', 499, 1, 2, 938148) this letter, of which or parts of which you may make whatever use you like—though of course it is my letter and not Bapu’s and I am posting is without showing it to him.
('72', 499, 1, 3, 938318) If you feel that the statement should go as it is, you are at liberty to release it—i.e.
('72', 499, 1, 4, 938407) to say, you may say that you have had an unconvincing answer and that you must act in accordance with the dictates of your own mind.
('72', 499, 2, 5, 938540) Regarding violation of truth and non violence as evidenced in the activities of some of our ministers, Bapu would like you to write frankly and fully, regardless of his recent state of health.
('72', 499, 2, 6, 938733) For that violation, no matter where it comes from, has to be denounced and if our Ministers are really guilty of it they would deserve to be turned out.
('72', 499, 3, 7, 938886) He understands all you say about the Bengal affairs.
('72', 499, 3, 8, 938939) Far from expecting you to get “wildly excited” over the releases, all he wanted you to say was whether the way he had interviewed the Governor and the Ministers on the question of the release of prisoners and detenus met with your approval or not.
('72', 499, 4, 9, 939187) Yours affectionately,

('72', 499, 11, 16, 939339) DEAR MR. GANDHI,
('72', 499, 12, 17, 939356) Thanks very much for your letter.
('72', 499, 12, 18, 939390) I am sorry to learn about your indisposition.
('72', 499, 12, 19, 939436) I hope you will soon completely recover your health.
('72', 499, 13, 20, 939489) In our opinion your statement is very fair and we thank you for it.
('72', 499, 13, 21, 939557) The wording of the Government communique is not perhaps very happy as far as the four months’ period is concerned.
('72', 499, 13, 22, 939672) It certainly brings out the Government’s point of view, namely, that only after the end of four months the question of a large scale release of the remaining detenus will be considered whereas it misleads the public in giving the impression that you will take up the question at the end of four months.
('72', 499, 13, 23, 939975) But there is nothing in the communique to prevent your coming and interviewing these people before the expiry of four months.
('72', 499, 14, 24, 940101) In your letter you have asked that Mr. Sarat Bose should be allowed to carry on the conversation with the detenus in your absence.
('72', 499, 14, 25, 940232) I would like to make it

('72', 500, 1, 2, 940345) quite clear that my objection to this suggestion is not based on personal grounds but on the question of principle.
('72', 500, 1, 3, 940461) treat you differently from all other political leaders in India and therefore neither your purpose nor Govt.’s object will be served by anyone else but your interviewing the detenus.
('72', 500, 1, 4, 940644) After your visit to Hijli, Govt.
('72', 500, 1, 5, 940677) allowed Dr. B. C. Roy and Mrs. Sarojini Naidu to interview the State prisoners.
('72', 500, 1, 6, 940757) Dr. Roy went there more in the capacity of a physician than a political leader and we made an exception for Mrs. Sarojini Naidu but as far as I am concerned I do not propose to allow any other political leader in future to interview the State prisoners.
('72', 500, 2, 7, 941011) I had presumed that personal touch between you and the individual detenu or State prisoner was necessary in order that you might be assured that the individual concerned had become a convinced adherent to the principles of non violence, following upon a change of heart and as a matter of principle quite independently of personal or political advantage.
('72', 500, 2, 8, 941366) It was a matter then not of bargaining between you.
('72', 500, 2, 9, 941418) It was necessary for you of course to explain the principles of non violence and persuade the subject to their acceptance.
('72', 500, 2, 10, 941541) But so far as the prisoner was concerned, it was a matter of simple statement whether he had reached that position or not.
('72', 500, 2, 11, 941664) This point of view has bearing on the question of the correspondence as well as that of interviews with the prisoners by persons other than yourself.
('72', 500, 2, 12, 941814) We should not object to correspondence under sealed cover between you and any State prisoner or detenu provided that it is understood that such letters as you receive are shown to nobody else.
('72', 500, 3, 13, 942007) As long as I am Home Minister, you can rest assured that whatever may be the language of the communique everything that we agreed upon will —insha allah—be given effect to provided nothing untoward happens in the mean time.
('72', 500, 4, 14, 942231) I agree with your explanation or amplification of the phrase “subversive movement”.
('72', 500, 4, 15, 942315) The only portion in the letter on which we differ is the reference to the convicted political prisoners.
('72', 500, 4, 16, 942420) As you are aware we agreed to take certain steps in connection with the convicted political prisoners.
('72', 500, 4, 17, 942523) I have issued instructions for action being taken on these lines but beyond this Government are not prepared to go.
('72', 500, 4, 18, 942639) I agree with what you have stated in your PS.
('72', 500, 4, 19, 942685) Repatriation will take place according to plan mentioned to you.

('72', 501, 2, 3, 942918) LETTER FROM M. A. JINNAH 1
('72', 501, 3, 4, 942945) NEW DELHI,
('72', 501, 4, 5, 942956) February 15, 1938
('72', 501, 5, 6, 942974) DEAR MR. GANDHI,
('72', 501, 6, 7, 942991) I have received your letter of the 3rd February 1938 which was redirected here.
('72', 501, 6, 8, 943071) I did not complain to the Maulana Sahib about the absence of any reply from you.
('72', 501, 6, 9, 943152) I only mentioned the facts as he was anxious that we two should meet.
('72', 501, 6, 10, 943222) Anyhow, I am glad to hear from you.
('72', 501, 6, 11, 943258) My message to you through Mr. Kher as I informed you in my last letter, was not private.
('72', 501, 6, 12, 943347) It was only when Mr. Kher went to see you at Wardha that I did say that he should not mention the matter to anyone except you and that if you yourself were inclined in the first instance to take up the matter, then it will be more than half the battle won.
('72', 501, 6, 13, 943604) On his return to Bombay Mr. Kher told me that it was difficult for you to give a reply as you were restricted not to disclose it to anyone or consult anybody else.
('72', 501, 7, 14, 943768) Thereupon I said that it was not intended to be a secret and that he was free and you were free to put your heads together and let me know whether at that juncture you were inclined to take up this matter with your powerful and overwhelming influence which you exercise over the Congress.
('72', 501, 7, 15, 944057) Then he saw you again at Teethal and from that moment it ceased to be a private matter between two individuals; and he brought me your reply in writing which I had to publish because you know of the controversy between me and Babu Rajendra Prasad and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in the Press where it was sought to make out that I was putting every obstacle in the way of Hindu Muslim settlement.
('72', 501, 7, 16, 944450) As your letter was not marked confidential I used it.
('72', 501, 7, 17, 944504) Besides, what is wrong in my saying that I had approached you on my own accord and that was a reply I received from you?
('72', 501, 7, 18, 944625) I cannot understand why you feel so much about it.
('72', 501, 7, 19, 944676) You say that I complained of your silence.
('72', 501, 7, 20, 944719) Well, I do.
('72', 501, 7, 21, 944731) But you further proceed to say, “Believe me the moment I can do something that can bring the two communities together, nothing in the world can prevent me from so doing.” Now, what am I to gather from this?
('72', 501, 7, 22, 944938) Am I right in interpreting that the moment is not come?
('72', 501, 8, 23, 944994) With regard to your opinion that my speech at the Lucknow session and my later pronouncements, which you are pleased to call a declaration of war, I can only repeat that it is in self defence.
('72', 501, 8, 24, 945187) Evidently, you are not acquainted with what is going on in the Congress Press—the amount of vilification, misrepresentation and falsehood that is daily spread about me—otherwise, I am sure, you would not blame
('72', 501, 9, 25, 945397) 1 Vide “Letter to M. A. Jinnah”, 3 2 1938
('72', 502, 0, 1, 945439) VOL. 72 : 6 JULY 1937 20 FEBRUARY, 1938 503
('72', 502, 2, 2, 945483) With regard to your saying that when in 1915 you returned from South Africa everybody spoke of me as one of the staunchest of nationalists and the hope of both the Hindus and Mussalmans, and you ask me a question, “Are you still the same Mr. Jinnah ?” and proceed further to say, “If you say you are, in spite of your speeches I shall accept your word.” And you say that in my speeches you miss the old nationalist.
('72', 502, 2, 3, 945899) Do you think that you are justified in saying that?
('72', 502, 2, 4, 945951) I would not like to say what people spoke of you in 1915 and what they speak and think of you today.
('72', 502, 2, 5, 946052) Nationalism is not the monopoly of any single individual; and in these days it is very difficult to define it: but I don’t wish to pursue this line of controversy any further.
('72', 502, 3, 6, 946228) You conclude by saying: “Lastly you want me to come forward with some proposal.
('72', 502, 3, 7, 946308) What proposal can I make except to ask you on bended knees to be what I had thought you were.
('72', 502, 3, 8, 946402) But the proposals to form the basis of unity between the two communities have surely got to come from you.” I think you might have spared your appeal and need not have preached to me on your bended knees to be what you had thought I was.
('72', 502, 3, 9, 946640) As regards the formation of proposals which would form the basis of unity, do you think that this can be done by correspondence?
('72', 502, 3, 10, 946769) Surely, you know as much as I do what are the fundamental points in dispute.
('72', 502, 3, 11, 946846) In my opinion it is as much up to you to suggest ways and means of tackling the problem.
('72', 502, 3, 12, 946935) If you genuinely and sincerely desire and you feel that the moment has come for you to step in and with your position and influence you are prepared to take the matter up earnestly, I will not fail to render all the assistance I can.
('72', 502, 4, 13, 947169) Yours sincerely,
('72', 502, 5, 14, 947186) M. A. JINNAH
