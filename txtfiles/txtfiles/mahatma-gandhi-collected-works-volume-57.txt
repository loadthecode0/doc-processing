('57', 0, 2, 3, 75) September 5, 1932
('57', 0, 3, 4, 93) MY DEAR PADMAJA, Your basket of oranges again!
('57', 0, 3, 5, 140) Seeing that you will insist on sending them no matter what I say.
('57', 0, 3, 6, 206) let me tell you that they are really a good variety—very juicy.
('57', 0, 3, 7, 270) You have responded to the gentle driving by the poor little slave driver.
('57', 0, 3, 8, 344) Even I could decipher your letter without difficulty.
('57', 0, 3, 9, 398) But I do not want you, please, to exert yourself when you are lying flat on your back.
('57', 0, 3, 10, 485) Any abomination will do.
('57', 0, 3, 11, 510) Even the abominations of loved ones are preferable to their silence.
('57', 0, 3, 12, 579) But when you are really ill, why not get some willing assistance?
('57', 0, 3, 13, 645) Anybody will gladly write to your dictation.
('57', 0, 3, 14, 690) Your mention of that magnificent story of the Buddha brings to mind many sacred things.
('57', 0, 3, 15, 778) Yes, I do dream many dreams.
('57', 0, 3, 16, 807) All may not be airy nothings or I would be crushed under the weight of the love I appropriate from people of all sorts and conditions—men, women, boys and girls.
('57', 0, 3, 17, 969) 1 Sardar and Mahadev have more books than they can cope with.
('57', 0, 3, 18, 1031) The former is absorbed like a diligent student in his Sanskrit studies; the latter in his French and Urdu thanks all the same on their behalf for your offer.
('57', 0, 3, 19, 1189) It is no use, I fear, your wanting to see them.
('57', 0, 3, 20, 1237) I wish it was possible.
('57', 0, 3, 21, 1261) Love from us all.
('57', 0, 4, 22, 1279) Yours, SLAVE DRIVER

('57', 1, 2, 3, 1610) September 5, 1932
('57', 1, 3, 4, 1628) BHAI NANALAL, I had been awaiting your letter and was relieved when it came.
('57', 1, 3, 5, 1705) I have already written to Mayashankar 1 ; I hope he got the letter.
('57', 1, 3, 6, 1773) I have been restraining Champa.
('57', 1, 3, 7, 1805) I had also dissuaded Manjula 2. I think Maganlal would welcome this.
('57', 1, 3, 8, 1874) She seems to me a very wise girl.
('57', 1, 3, 9, 1908) Do you find any difficulty in selling the emeralds?
('57', 1, 3, 10, 1960) Or is it because of obstruction by somebody that you have not been able to sell them?
('57', 1, 3, 11, 2046) It is certainly worthy of you not to wish to withdraw the money deposited in your name by the Doctor.
('57', 1, 3, 12, 2148) The daughters, however, should get the money set apart for them, but at present I see no possibility of their being able to withdraw any part of it.
('57', 1, 3, 13, 2297) Hence, the time has not yet come for thinking about your share.
('57', 1, 3, 14, 2361) Everything can be settled if the train gets on the rails.
('57', 1, 3, 15, 2419) We will see about it provided the family does not break up and the bitterness disappears.
('57', 1, 3, 16, 2509) Please write to me regularly.
('57', 1, 3, 17, 2539) If you act as Chhaganlal advises, everything will end well.
('57', 1, 3, 18, 2599) I know that you will go on doing your duty irrespective of whether they love you or slight you and, therefore, I do not worry.
('57', 1, 4, 19, 2726) Blessings from BAPU

('57', 1, 6, 21, 2772) 3. A LETTER
('57', 1, 7, 22, 2784) September 5, 1932 You are either cunning or foolish.
('57', 1, 7, 23, 2837) Do you really not know what ‘vikar’ means?
('57', 1, 7, 24, 2880) The vikar resulting from eating pulses and that resulting from physical touch, are both signs of something wrong in us.
('57', 1, 7, 25, 3000) Both disturb the equilibrium.
('57', 1, 7, 26, 3030) The first kind of vikar results from swallowing some external substance; the second is a change of mental state resulting from the sight of some external object.
('57', 1, 7, 27, 3192) A vikar that can shake one’s whole being may prove harmful.
('57', 1, 7, 28, 3252) If a woman feels vikar
('57', 1, 8, 29, 3275) 1 Mayashankar Vrajlal Desai, business partner of Dr. Pranjivan Mehta.

('57', 2, 1, 2, 3419) towards a man, society does not always hold her guilty; that is, when it springs from a desire to marry that person and such marriage is not forbidden, the matter is not kept secret from one’s people and one is free to marry.
('57', 2, 1, 3, 3645) According to me, you are not yet fit to marry, for you are studying and are still a minor.
('57', 2, 1, 4, 3736) Your having such relations with .
('57', 2, 2, 5, 3770) 1 is improper, as he was your teacher and was, moreover, like a brother to you.
('57', 2, 2, 6, 3850) Call your feeling what you like, whether vikar or desire for marriage, you kept it secret and, therefore, it is blameworthy.
('57', 2, 2, 7, 3975) You do not understand the meaning of independence also.
('57', 2, 2, 8, 4031) When you show the letters to your elders of your own free will, you do not lose your independence but seek your safety.
('57', 2, 2, 9, 4151) If somebody posts himself at our door step, he is like a Government bailiff depriving us of our freedom; but if we station a watchman at the gate, we do not lose our freedom but protect it.
('57', 2, 2, 10, 4341) In the same way, if you in your adolescent state regard your elders as guardians of your interests, open your heart to them and show your letters to them.
('57', 2, 2, 11, 4496) You do not lose your independence but seek protection for it.
('57', 2, 2, 12, 4558) I earnestly wish that you should become independent.
('57', 2, 2, 13, 4611) It was for protecting your independence that I advised you to show your letters, etc., to your parents.
('57', 2, 2, 14, 4715) If, however, you cannot reconcile yourself to this and feel it an irksome restraint, you may keep your letters private.
('57', 2, 2, 15, 4835) I do not want to put pressure on you in any way, as that would crush your individuality.
('57', 2, 2, 16, 4924) I only wish that you should become a brave girl and a spirited servant of the people.
('57', 2, 2, 17, 5010) And I shall be extremely pained if you stop writing to me.

('57', 2, 7, 22, 5181) It is my conviction that your husband 3 will come round.
('57', 2, 7, 23, 5238) I have recieved the doctor’s letter which has kept me informed of his health.

('57', 3, 4, 8, 5951) Be good and serve the country.
('57', 3, 4, 9, 5982) Keep the vow which you have taken, namely, that during the year in which you are entering you will learn by heart four chapters 1 .
('57', 3, 4, 10, 6114) And also make an effort to understand their meaning.

('57', 3, 8, 13, 6238) September 7, 1932
('57', 3, 9, 14, 6256) BHAISHRI RATILAL, I have your letter.
('57', 3, 9, 15, 6294) Chhaganlal and Lilavati 2 write to me and I feel satisfied with their letters.
('57', 3, 9, 16, 6373) I also receive complaints against both of them which I immediately pass on to them.
('57', 3, 9, 17, 6457) Lilavati wrote about her health to me too.
('57', 3, 9, 18, 6500) If Chhaganlal willingly permits her to go, I think it would be good to call her there for some time.
('57', 3, 9, 19, 6601) Her health at any rate would improve.
('57', 3, 9, 20, 6639) Manekbehn 3 seems to be very much displeased with her.
('57', 3, 9, 21, 6694) Lilavati says that she has done nothing but I do not believe she is so completely innocent.
('57', 3, 9, 22, 6786) For one thing, her tongue is very sharp.
('57', 3, 9, 23, 6827) And, moreover, Manekbehn is a simple minded woman and anybody can easily deceive her.
('57', 3, 9, 24, 6913) I had observed in Rangoon and also when Lilavati was at Sabarmati, that she could not tolerate any criticism.
('57', 3, 9, 25, 7023) But how can even you change her nature?
('57', 3, 9, 26, 7063) You have been exercising upon her whatever good influence you can as her father.
('57', 3, 10, 27, 7144) 1 Of the Gita.
('57', 3, 10, 28, 7159) 2 Addressee’s daughter, and chhaganlal’s wife.

('57', 4, 1, 2, 7284) Maganlal wrote to me a letter with which I was quite satisfied.
('57', 4, 1, 3, 7348) Manjula seems to me to be a girl who has not yet felt the evil influence of the ways of the world.
('57', 4, 1, 4, 7447) If necessary, I will request you to go to Rangoon.
('57', 4, 1, 5, 7498) Let us hope that the two brothers will settle everything peacefully.

('57', 4, 5, 9, 7704) September 7, 1932
('57', 4, 6, 10, 7722) PRABHUDAS, I have your letter.
('57', 4, 6, 11, 7753) What you want cannot be sent for Rentia Baras.
('57', 4, 6, 12, 7800) How do you forget that we are prisoners?
('57', 4, 6, 13, 7841) But you may imagine that our yarn is there.
('57', 4, 6, 14, 7885) Mahadev draws yarn of about hundred counts from Keshu’s slivers.
('57', 4, 6, 15, 7950) If there is a proper spindle, it would not take much to draw a thinner yarn.
('57', 4, 6, 16, 8027) I spin a yarn of 40 counts on Magan spinning wheel.
('57', 4, 6, 17, 8079) It takes about three hours to spin 250 rounds of yarn.
('57', 4, 6, 18, 8134) It takes much of my time.
('57', 4, 6, 19, 8160) But as long as my hand gives work, I will stick to it.
('57', 4, 6, 20, 8215) This time, I do not have with me the right mechanic.
('57', 4, 6, 21, 8268) Otherwise, I would have got the alterations made.
('57', 4, 6, 22, 8318) Whatever changes you make, do not sacrifice the simplicity of the spinning wheel.
('57', 4, 6, 23, 8400) In order to draw fine yarn, I feel the distance between the spindle and the tip should be reduced.
('57', 4, 6, 24, 8499) There are more chances of fine yarn gettingsnapped if drawn long.
('57', 4, 6, 25, 8565) The spindle should be shorter and thinner than it is.
('57', 4, 6, 26, 8619) This is only my thinking.
('57', 4, 6, 27, 8645) That you have set up a limit [of work] is more than enough.
('57', 4, 6, 28, 8705) Do not be impatient.
('57', 4, 6, 29, 8726) Do not build castles in the air.
('57', 4, 6, 30, 8759) Keep writing to me regularly.

('57', 5, 2, 3, 8924) September 8, 1932 For exercise, pranayama done slowly and standing has wonderful effect.
('57', 5, 2, 4, 9013) It should be done slowly and methodically.
('57', 5, 2, 5, 9056) You have to keep time in pranayama as you have to in music.
('57', 5, 2, 6, 9116) The breathing must be rhythmic.
('57', 5, 2, 7, 9148) Once you have learnt to do this by practice, your lungs will have to do much less work and at the same time they will be able to inhale more oxygen.
('57', 5, 2, 8, 9297) As they inhale more oxygen, they exhale more carbon dioxide.
('57', 5, 2, 9, 9358) You can gradually increase the time of this exercise.
('57', 5, 2, 10, 9412) If it is done correctly, its beneficial effects will be felt immediately.
('57', 5, 2, 11, 9486) You will feel less tired, your appetite will improve, the mind will remain calm and, if the body is cold, it will become warm.
('57', 5, 2, 12, 9613) Yes, it is true that my reason does not accept the necessity of sex pleasure, and my view is confirmed by experience.
('57', 5, 2, 13, 9731) The dangerous thing about artificial means of birth control is that their acceptance implies the acceptance of the necessity of sex pleasure.
('57', 5, 2, 14, 9873) If the princ iple is universally adopted, that brahmacharya is desirable in all conditions, nobody would use artificial means of birth control.
('57', 5, 2, 15, 10017) As thefts will continue, though stealing is an anti social activity, so also it is likely that artifical means of birth control will continue to be used.
('57', 5, 2, 16, 10171) But it is necessary to create a climate of opinion in which they are regarded as undesirable.
('57', 5, 2, 17, 10265) Anybody who indulges in sex pleasure must accept the responsibility of progeny.
('57', 5, 2, 18, 10345) The hardships resulting from the birth of children must be borne.
('57', 5, 2, 19, 10411) It is only thus that one can learn the lesson of complete self control.

('57', 6, 1, 5, 11056) I have stopped taking rice and dal even after coming here.

('57', 7, 8, 9, 12620) DEAR FRIEND, I have to thank you for your frank and full letter telegraphed and received this day.
('57', 7, 8, 10, 12719) I am sorry, however, that you put upon the contemplated step 2 an interpretation that never crossed my mind.
('57', 7, 8, 11, 12828) I have claimed to speak on behalf of the very class to sacrifice whose interests you impute to me a desire to fast myself to death.
('57', 7, 8, 12, 12960) I had hoped that extreme step itself would effectively prevent any such selfish interpretation.
('57', 7, 8, 13, 13056) Without arguing I affirm that for me this matter is one of pure religion.
('57', 7, 8, 14, 13130) The mere fact of “Depressed” classes having double votes does not protect them or Hindu society in general from being disrupted.
('57', 7, 8, 15, 13259) In establishment of a separate electorate at all for “Depressed” classes I sense the injection of a poison that is calculated to destroy Hinduism and do no good whatsoever to “Depressed” classes.
('57', 7, 8, 16, 13455) You will please permit me to say that no matter how sympathetic you may be you cannot come to a correct decision on a matter of such vital and religious importance to the parties concerned.
('57', 7, 8, 17, 13645) I should not be against even over representation of “Depressed” Classes.
('57', 7, 8, 18, 13718) What I am against is their statutory separation, even in a limited form, from Hindu fold, so long as they choose to belong to it.
('57', 7, 8, 19, 13848) Do you not realize that if your decision stands and constitution comes into being, you arrest the marvellous growth of work of Hindu reformers who have dedicated themselves to the uplift of their suppressed brethren in every walk of life?

('57', 8, 1, 2, 14375) I have therefore been compelled reluctantly to adhere to the decision conveyed to you.
('57', 8, 1, 3, 14462) As your letter may give rise to a misunderstanding, I wish to state that the fact of my having isolated for special treatment the “Depressed” Classes question from other parts of your decision does not in any way mean I approve of or am reconciled to other parts of decision.
('57', 8, 1, 4, 14738) In my opinion many other parts are open to very grave objection.
('57', 8, 1, 5, 14803) Only I do not consider them to be any warrant for calling from me such self immolation as my conscience has prompted me to in the matter of “Deepressed” Classes.

('57', 8, 6, 12, 15168) NARANDAS, Please let me have the following information as soon as possible: 1. How much fuel is consumed in making rotlis and how much in making bread from the same quantity of flour?
('57', 8, 6, 13, 15352) 2. The method of making bread.
('57', 8, 6, 14, 15383) (a) How is the leaven prepared?
('57', 8, 6, 15, 15415) (b) In addition to leaven, do we mix salt, jaggery or sugar with the flour?
('57', 8, 6, 16, 15491) (c) The various steps of the process;
('57', 8, 7, 17, 15529) (d) How long is the dough left over?
('57', 8, 8, 18, 15566) (e) How long is the loaf kept in the oven?
('57', 8, 8, 19, 15609) In short, the description should be so written out that, after reading it, we can try the method here.
('57', 8, 8, 20, 15712) I want this information so that I may compare our method with the method followed here.
('57', 8, 8, 21, 15800) How much quantity of flour do you use these days for making bread?
('57', 8, 8, 22, 15867) What does the flour cost?
('57', 8, 8, 23, 15893) How many persons would have to work for making rotlis and for making bread from the same quantity of flour?

('57', 9, 5, 5, 16273) BHAU, Do not brood over the deeper meaning of the Gita.
('57', 9, 5, 6, 16329) As you try to put into practice its teaching about non attachment, its deeper meaning will automatically reveal itself to you, and, when you understand it, you will be perfectly satisfied.
('57', 9, 5, 7, 16518) Meanwhile, you should have faith in the meaning explained by Vinoba.
('57', 9, 5, 8, 16587) Mostly my explanations are his.
('57', 9, 5, 9, 16619) Wherever you find a difference between us, you should tentatively accept the meaning which appeals to you.
('57', 9, 5, 10, 16726) There is no doubt at all that if you can spin with ease with a bamboo takli.
('57', 9, 5, 11, 16803) it is most suitable for the purpose.
('57', 9, 5, 12, 16840) You should also learn how to make such a takli.
('57', 9, 5, 13, 16888) If you have not tried enema for constipation, you should do so.
('57', 9, 5, 14, 16952) Sometimes it seems to help very much.
('57', 9, 5, 15, 16990) I get a little news about Wardha, but you also should give me in your letters whatever news you get there.
('57', 9, 5, 16, 17097) Do not lose hope about overcoming your constipation.

('57', 9, 10, 20, 17281) GANGABEHN, This time you wrote to me a long and beautiful letter.
('57', 9, 10, 21, 17347) I know, of course, that to you Hakimji is not merely a physician but is a brother, one of your family, a friend, a counsellor and a respected elder too.
('57', 9, 10, 22, 17500) It is, therefore, quite right that you take as much help from him as he can give.
('57', 9, 10, 23, 17582) You did well in visiting the homes of

('57', 10, 1, 3, 17770) Such work will bear fruit in future.

('57', 10, 1, 5, 17903) The Inspector General gave me news about Kakasaheb.
('57', 10, 1, 6, 17955) He is in good health.
('57', 10, 1, 7, 17977) I had also a letter from him.
('57', 10, 1, 8, 18007) Though it is true that he has lost weight, he is not suffering from any disease.
('57', 10, 1, 9, 18088) There is, therefore, no cause for worry.
('57', 10, 1, 10, 18129) Lakshmi, it seems, is enjoying the benefit of good company.
('57', 10, 1, 11, 18189) It was good that you paid a visit to Noorbanu 1. Look after Qureshi as long as you are there.

('57', 10, 1, 13, 18327) If you feel comfortable staying with Shamalbhai 2 you may certainly do so.
('57', 10, 1, 14, 18402) Do what keeps you cheerful.
('57', 10, 1, 15, 18430) My mind is at rest since Nath is there always to help you.
('57', 10, 1, 16, 18489) My advice regarding Babu 3 is that, for the present, he should study, that is, he should become proficient in Gujarati, Sanskrit, Hindi, arithmetic, history, geography, all the processes through which cotton passes till it is woven into khadi, and carpentry, and learn a little music.
('57', 10, 1, 17, 18774) He will then know what line to take up.
('57', 10, 1, 18, 18814) His intellect must blossom and his heart must expand.
('57', 10, 1, 19, 18868) Sardar and Mahadev of course read your letters.

('57', 11, 4, 6, 19493) I have not received Bishop Fisher’s 1 book yet.
('57', 11, 4, 7, 19541) As you know Sardar Vallabhbhai and Mahadev Desai are with me.
('57', 11, 4, 8, 19603) We are turning the time at our disposal to good account.
('57', 11, 4, 9, 19660) We are just now concentrating upon drawing from the quality of cotton at our disposal as fine a thread as possible.
('57', 11, 4, 10, 19776) The experiment is deeply interesting and even exciting if there can be excitement about such a humdrum process as hand spinning.
('57', 11, 4, 11, 19905) For us it is a demand of Indian humanity.

('57', 12, 3, 5, 20668) Once you have decided that it is good to do a certain thing, you should not wait for even one second.
('57', 12, 3, 6, 20770) For death may come at any time, and therefore, delay in beginning a good thing may result in our inability to do it at all.

('57', 14, 3, 6, 23609) For that, sincerity and co operation on the part of everybody are required.
('57', 14, 3, 7, 23685) If all of you work as a team, each doing his best, a lot more work can be done.

('57', 15, 3, 8, 25240) But I think I have said too much.

('57', 15, 3, 10, 25344) You will say that you knew it.

('57', 15, 3, 21, 26000) ever since I saw her and .
('57', 15, 3, 22, 26027) .’s affection for her and hers for him.
('57', 15, 3, 23, 26067) I have always believed in the innocence of their love.
('57', 15, 3, 24, 26122) But how could I burden .
('57', 15, 3, 25, 26147) with a responsibility till an opportunity arose?
('57', 15, 3, 26, 26196) Your letter gave me the required opportunity.
('57', 15, 3, 27, 26242) I do not know whether my diagnosis is correct and whether .
('57', 15, 3, 28, 26302) is the remedy for him.
('57', 15, 3, 29, 26325) Perhaps .
('57', 15, 3, 30, 26335) herself does not know it.
('57', 15, 3, 31, 26361) We can discover the truth only if we try the remedy which I have suggested.
('57', 15, 3, 32, 26437) All that I desire is .
('57', 15, 3, 33, 26460) .’s peace of mind.
('57', 15, 3, 34, 26479) In the absence of such peace, his abilities remain unused and his health is wasting away.
('57', 15, 3, 35, 26569) He does not even know whether he feels interested in the work which he does.
('57', 15, 3, 36, 26646) You seem to have collected from somewhere a good many stories about my childhood.
('57', 15, 3, 37, 26728) Do you know that Ramabehn is ill?
('57', 15, 3, 38, 26762) You should at least go and talk to her.
('57', 15, 3, 39, 26802) In actual fact there is often no cause for the fear which we entertain in our imagination.
('57', 15, 3, 40, 26893) The saying, “A ghost is the projection

('57', 16, 1, 2, 27033) of our fancies and a witch of our fears” is literally true.
('57', 16, 1, 3, 27093) It is a hundred per cent true.
('57', 16, 1, 4, 27124) I hope you are properly looking after the new arrivals among women.
('57', 16, 1, 5, 27192) You may reduce your other work, but attend to this carefully.
('57', 16, 1, 6, 27254) I read about Kisan 1 in the paper.
('57', 16, 1, 7, 27289) Dhurandhar has been doing fine work.
('57', 16, 1, 8, 27326) But he should take care and make his body strong.
('57', 16, 1, 9, 27376) What is his weight?
('57', 16, 1, 10, 27396) What did I write about you in my letter to Anandi 2 ?
('57', 16, 1, 11, 27450) What did I tell Lilavati 3?
('57', 16, 1, 12, 27478) I don’t remember.
('57', 16, 1, 13, 27496) I have no doubt at all about your observing brahmacharya at present.
('57', 16, 1, 14, 27565) I don’t know what may happen in the future.
('57', 16, 1, 15, 27609) If you can tell, you know more than Narad and Rama did.
('57', 16, 1, 16, 27665) However, I have always admired your resolution.
('57', 16, 1, 17, 27713) I don’t believe that anyone can easily tempt you.
('57', 16, 1, 18, 27763) But I have seen women as determined as you get married.
('57', 16, 1, 19, 27819) How can anyone blame them for that?
('57', 16, 1, 20, 27855) Hence, at present I can only wish that you will remain faithful to your resolution, and bless you that you may.
('57', 16, 1, 21, 27967) I may help you as much as I can, and give you blows as often as necessary.
('57', 16, 1, 22, 28042) The result lies in God’s hands.
('57', 16, 1, 23, 28074) I want your letters to be in no way different from what they are.
('57', 16, 1, 24, 28140) If you cease to be natural, I will take no interest in you.
('57', 16, 1, 25, 28200) You are full of complexes.
('57', 16, 1, 26, 28227) I can try to remove them only as and when I observe them.
('57', 16, 1, 27, 28285) However, who am I to remove them?
('57', 16, 1, 28, 28319) It does not lie in man’s power to do so.
('57', 16, 1, 29, 28360) I should like to be an instrument in removing them to the extent that He permits me to be so.
('57', 16, 1, 30, 28454) It is in my interest to do this, since I hope to take much work from you.
('57', 16, 1, 31, 28528) If I believed that what I was trying to inculcate in you would bear no fruit, do you think I would take the trouble to write these long letters?
('57', 16, 1, 32, 28673) I do not know any instance of the cause of an individual’s or society’s fall having been discovered.
('57', 16, 1, 33, 28774) Many guesses, of course, have been made.
('57', 16, 1, 34, 28815) The immediate cause is sometimes discovered, but in all cases there is not one such cause only.
('57', 16, 1, 35, 28911) Generally speaking, however, it may be said that a fall can be traced to lack of dharma.
('57', 16, 1, 36, 29000) Political subjection can never be the root cause, for it is itself the result of other causes, other weaknesses.

('57', 17, 1, 2, 29233) One’s duty as a neighbour is always to help a neighbour in a manner consistent with dharma.
('57', 17, 1, 3, 29325) The seed of ego is destroyed only when one feels oneself to be a cipher.
('57', 17, 1, 4, 29398) If anyone looks inward and ponders deeply over the matter, he cannot but realize his total insignificance.
('57', 17, 1, 5, 29505) As we count an insect insignificant relatively to the earth, so is man insignificant in relation to this universe which is millions of times vaster than the earth.
('57', 17, 1, 6, 29669) That he is endowed with reason makes no difference to this fact.
('57', 17, 1, 7, 29734) His greatness lies in realizing his insignificance, for simultaneously with such realization, he realizes that, insignificant in himself, he is an insignificant aspect of God and that, when he merges in Him, he becomes God, that this microscopic atom which he is contains the infinite power of God.
('57', 17, 1, 8, 30033) I believe in the theory of maya in my own way.
('57', 17, 1, 9, 30080) In the cycle of Time this universe is maya, but, during the moment of time it exists, it is real enough.
('57', 17, 1, 10, 30185) I believe in the theory of the many sidedness of truth.
('57', 17, 1, 11, 30241) If there is anything in this world which faces man as a certainty, it is death.
('57', 17, 1, 12, 30321) And yet we fear that inescapable certainty; that is the greatest wonder of life, that is real attachment and that is atheism.
('57', 17, 1, 13, 30447) It is possibe only for man to rise above it.
('57', 17, 1, 14, 30492) One’s good and evil deeds do accompany the soul after the death of the body.
('57', 17, 1, 15, 30569) The soul, as soul, suffers their consequences, whether in another physical body or in a subtle body.
('57', 17, 1, 16, 30670) Isn’t this enough?

('57', 18, 6, 7, 31309) PUSHPA, Should not people living together give presents to one another?
('57', 18, 6, 8, 31381) What about the presents given by parents to their children on their birthdays or on festivals?
('57', 18, 6, 9, 31476) Besides, in the Ashram all live together.
('57', 18, 6, 10, 31518) But no one can take something belonging to another without his permission.
('57', 18, 6, 11, 31593) I do not say that presents have to be given.
('57', 18, 6, 12, 31638) But the argument you advance is not valid.
('57', 18, 6, 13, 31681) Supposing you had simply plucked a flower and presented it to Mangala that morning, it would have been a token of love.
('57', 18, 6, 14, 31801) But your argument is: if Mangala is given a present, why not the other girls?
('57', 18, 6, 15, 31879) Real love is not in giving the present.
('57', 18, 6, 16, 31919) Love expresses itself spontaneously when the moment comes.

('57', 19, 1, 2, 32444) 30. A LETTER
('57', 19, 2, 3, 32457) September 11, 1932 You say that you are mentally disturbed and that, therefore, you will not write to me.
('57', 19, 2, 4, 32563) This too is a sign of vikar.
('57', 19, 2, 5, 32592) It is necessary to understand the exact meaning of this word.
('57', 19, 2, 6, 32654) Even being angry is vikar.
('57', 19, 2, 7, 32681) To feel all kinds of desires is also vikar.
('57', 19, 2, 8, 32725) To think of wearing this or that, eating or not eating this or that is vikar.
('57', 19, 2, 9, 32803) Similarly to wish to marry, or, even without wishing to marry, to feel pleasure in the company of boys of one’s own age, in talking with a boy in private and in touching him, or in unbecoming joking with him, that also is vikar.
('57', 19, 2, 10, 33032) This last is looked upon as a very serious vikar.
('57', 19, 2, 11, 33082) So long as a woman is subject to any of these vikars, she will be subject to menstruation.
('57', 19, 2, 12, 33173) In the case of man it is not menstruation, but something else.
('57', 19, 2, 13, 33236) In this sense even Mirabehn cannot be considered to be free from vikar.
('57', 19, 2, 14, 33308) So she still has menstruation.
('57', 19, 2, 15, 33339) She does not sin in this.
('57', 19, 2, 16, 33365) She has indeed risen very high.
('57', 19, 2, 17, 33397) She is continually striving to overcome all her vikars.
('57', 19, 2, 18, 33453) The vikar of desire for man has completely disappeared from within her.
('57', 19, 2, 19, 33525) But she still has anger and attachment, and desires.
('57', 19, 2, 20, 33578) All these too she strives to control.
('57', 19, 2, 21, 33616) If a woman attains a state free from vikars,such as I have described, she will not get monthly periods.
('57', 19, 2, 22, 33720) I would be happy if all of you girls were to strive to attain such a state.
('57', 19, 2, 23, 33796) Even if you do not succeed in your present life, what does it matter?
('57', 19, 2, 24, 33866) The first lesson for you to learn is to keep nothing secret.
('57', 19, 2, 25, 33927) You should have no secret relations with anyone.
('57', 19, 2, 26, 33976) You should cling to the vow of truth.

('57', 19, 6, 31, 34120) BRIJKRISHNA, I have your letter.
('57', 19, 6, 32, 34153) Your letters from Banaras and Delhi have not reached me.
('57', 19, 6, 33, 34210) You have not acknowledged the letters I addressed to Deolali.
('57', 19, 6, 34, 34272) It is good that you have now given me detailed news.
('57', 19, 6, 35, 34325) First of all about your health.
('57', 19, 6, 36, 34357) The benefit Mira has derived from salt is largely psychological.
('57', 19, 6, 37, 34422) It cannot all be attributed to salt; salt does not possess all that virtue.
('57', 19, 6, 38, 34498) No article of diet or medicine can affect

('57', 20, 1, 2, 34589) brahmacharya to that extent because ultimately brahmacharya is a state of mind; a disturbed mind affects the body.
('57', 20, 1, 3, 34704) As long as the mind is not firm and rid of passions how can diet alone help?
('57', 20, 1, 4, 34781) Admittedly, improper or excessive food can be harmful.
('57', 20, 1, 5, 34836) Salt, taken in small quantities can do no harm.
('57', 20, 1, 6, 34884) In the same way, it does not appear that you have lost much by giving up salt.
('57', 20, 1, 7, 34963) Salt does not have enough strength to affect one either way.
('57', 20, 1, 8, 35024) I have written to you earlier regarding a suitable diet for you.
('57', 20, 1, 9, 35089) Ultimately you must find out by experiment what food suits you.
('57', 20, 1, 10, 35153) Go to Deolali if you have found the climate there agreeable.
('57', 20, 1, 11, 35214) It may also be a good thing otherwise, for you will be of help to Radha and Damodardas.
('57', 20, 1, 12, 35302) True, there are only a few days left if they are to leave Deolali at the end of the month.
('57', 20, 1, 13, 35393) But however short the period it will benefit you to go there.
('57', 20, 1, 14, 35455) And even if they a have to vacate the sanatorium there is nothing wrong in your staying on at Deolali for your health’s sake.
('57', 20, 1, 15, 35581) It ought to be easy to find another place.
('57', 20, 1, 16, 35624) What happened to your plan of going to Kuvalayanand?
('57', 20, 1, 17, 35677) What did Dr. Talwalkar say?
('57', 20, 1, 18, 35705) You must build up your health.
('57', 20, 1, 19, 35736) Now for the Ashram.
('57', 20, 1, 20, 35756) It is true that the Ashram inmates are not what they ought to be, they are full of short comings.
('57', 20, 1, 21, 35854) That is why the public have the right to criticize and condemn the Ashram inmates who must not only tolerate the criticism but take a lesson from it.
('57', 20, 1, 22, 36004) I am not surprised to learn that you too have been similarly affected because that is the truth.
('57', 20, 1, 23, 36101) But in spite of all that the total result is not bad; that is my belief.
('57', 20, 1, 24, 36174) People residing in the Ashram have certainly changed for the better.
('57', 20, 1, 25, 36243) The fact is that much remains to be done while little has been accomplished, but that was to be expected.
('57', 20, 1, 26, 36349) And who can be defined as Ashram inmates?
('57', 20, 1, 27, 36391) If you have not discussed this matter with Narandas, open your heart to him and listen to what he has to say.
('57', 20, 1, 28, 36501) I have no hope of finding a more steadfast, wise, sensible and conscientious man than Narandas and I consider it God’s grace that it was granted me to have him.
('57', 20, 1, 29, 36662) It is also true that Ashram people are not free from diseases but they do not really catch illness in the Ashram; the malady is already with them.
('57', 20, 1, 30, 36809) In short we try to bring about fulfilment amid deficiency.
('57', 20, 1, 31, 36868) God has ordained that we go on making efforts till we die but has reserved unto Himself the fruit.
('57', 20, 1, 32, 36967) Thus I shall be content if it can be said that there is no tardiness of effort in our Ashram.
('57', 20, 1, 33, 37061) I shall even admit that there is scope for improvement in the effort.

('57', 21, 4, 5, 37283) 32. WORKING AND THINKING 2
('57', 21, 5, 6, 37310) September 11, 1932 I wrote some time ago about fully using our power of thinking when doing any work.
('57', 21, 5, 7, 37412) 3 I said something towards the end in that article, which it is necessary to explain further.
('57', 21, 5, 8, 37506) I suggested there that our thinking may be either conducive to or destructive of the general good, that, in other words, it may be either divine or demoniac in nature.
('57', 21, 5, 9, 37674) One person, as he spins daily, may think and try to invent improvements which would benefit the millions of spinners and make their work easier.
('57', 21, 5, 10, 37819) Another person may think how fine it would be if he alone could spin on his wheel as much yarn as ten million persons and get rich.
('57', 21, 5, 11, 37951) The thinking of the former is divine in nature, it is conducive to the good of society.
('57', 21, 5, 12, 38039) The thinking of the second person is demoniac, it is opposed to the good of society.
('57', 21, 5, 13, 38124) Thus, it is not enough that we should think when doing any work.
('57', 21, 5, 14, 38189) Our thinking should aim at the good of all,and not at satisfying our own selfish desires.
('57', 21, 5, 15, 38279) Indeed he who tries to serve only his selfish interests not only harms the good of others but in the end does not serve even his own good.
('57', 21, 5, 16, 38418) If everybody keeps this point of view before him and thinks about the work he is doing, and so works intelligently, he would get the best education, would find his work interesting, develop his intellect, enlarge and purify his heart, acquire efficiency in his work and make inventions and improvements which would benefit the world.
('57', 21, 5, 17, 38752) As the work has become more interesting it gives him joy; he feels no fatigue in doing it and the work becomes artistic whether it is cleaning lavatories or roads, shredding vegetables, anything connected with the dairy, writing accounts or something else.

('57', 22, 1, 5, 39603) It springs from within, from his sense of devotion to duty.
('57', 22, 1, 6, 39663) Anybody who wants to understand and practice Anasaktiyoga should do all work in this spirit.

('57', 22, 5, 10, 39871) September [7] 1/11, 1932
('57', 22, 6, 11, 39896) NARANDAS, It is the morning of Wednesday, and the goats are being milked, singing to us the while.
('57', 22, 6, 12, 39995) I duly got your mail last evening.
('57', 22, 6, 13, 40030) I send you my plentiful blessings.
('57', 22, 6, 14, 40065) Why should I not?
('57', 22, 6, 15, 40083) You are fulfilling all my hopes and, by your incomparable and intelligent service, fill all three of us with wonder.
('57', 22, 6, 16, 40200) God seems to have gifted you with the strength to face every kind of ordeal.
('57', 22, 6, 17, 40277) May you live long and realize the God of Truth through the goddess of ahimsa and help others to do the same.
('57', 22, 6, 18, 40386) I got your two postcards about Baba, but each late by a day.
('57', 22, 6, 19, 40447) The reason is that they did not reach the post office in time.
('57', 22, 6, 20, 40510) The words “detained late fee not paid” are stamped on both.
('57', 22, 6, 21, 40570) And so find out from the post office the time of the clearance.
('57', 22, 6, 22, 40634) Your bigger packet of mail posted on Monday and the postcard posted on Sunday reached me on the same day.
('57', 22, 7, 23, 40740) September 10, 1932
('57', 22, 8, 24, 40759) I have had no special letter from you till today from which I infer that Kanji Sheth is out of danger.
('57', 22, 8, 25, 40862) Not only that, he must also have regained strength.
('57', 22, 8, 26, 40914) I hope Dahibehn 2 is all right.
('57', 22, 8, 27, 40946) I read in the newspapers that you had very good rains there.
('57', 22, 8, 28, 41007) Mahadev has been able to go up to 105 counts with Keshu’s slivers.
('57', 22, 8, 29, 41074) I see that if he gets a straight and thin spindle, he will reach 105 counts without difficulty.

('57', 23, 0, 1, 41278) 24 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 23, 1, 2, 41319) Though I have asked you to send a thin spindle, we are trying to make one here.
('57', 23, 1, 3, 41399) We must discover the reason why the cotton grown in the Ashram is not of good quality.
('57', 23, 1, 4, 41486) The fact that it is attacked by insects shows that the manure is either too little or too much, or that it is not of the right kind.
('57', 23, 1, 5, 41619) You should ask somebody who knows the secret, orread the descriptions of different types of manures and soils in a book on cotton cultivation available in the market, and experiment accordingly.
('57', 23, 1, 6, 41814) Agricultural experts now believe that, within certain limits, any crop can be grown in any type of soil.With the help of the new methods they grow in France crops which were formerly thought impossible, and earn profits from them.
('57', 23, 1, 7, 42045) If anybody there can spare the time, he should study this problem.
('57', 23, 1, 8, 42112) I think that Maganlal had collected some books on agriculture.
('57', 23, 1, 9, 42175) We have a copy of the report of the Cotton Committee.
('57', 23, 1, 10, 42229) You may find some information even in that.
('57', 23, 1, 11, 42273) If you write to Prof.
('57', 23, 1, 12, 42295) Higginbottom at Allahabad, perhaps he may help you.
('57', 23, 1, 13, 42347) He has inspected the soil in the Ashram fields.
('57', 23, 1, 14, 42395) If the Gandiva spinning wheel is placed on one side at right angles to our body, instead of in front, one can stretch one’s legs if one wishes to do so.
('57', 23, 1, 15, 42548) If one wishes to spin sitting on a stool, one can do that, too, with ease.
('57', 23, 1, 16, 42623) The spinning wheel can be placed on a box or board on a level with the stool.
('57', 23, 1, 17, 42701) I did not follow your explanation about the Anantpur Report.
('57', 23, 1, 18, 42762) If it was sent by registered post, the post office must have a copy of the acknowledgement.
('57', 23, 1, 19, 42854) It will serve.
('57', 23, 1, 20, 42869) You can inquire in the post office and ascertain who has signed it.
('57', 23, 1, 21, 42937) If you are required to pay any fee for inspecting the record, you may do so.
('57', 23, 1, 22, 43014) If you have called for a fresh copy of the report, it means that this is the third copy he will be sending.
('57', 23, 1, 23, 43122) How can we put him to such trouble?
('57', 23, 1, 24, 43158) What you say about Padma is correct.
('57', 23, 1, 25, 43195) Read what I have written 1 to Panditiji in regard to the temple.
('57', 23, 1, 26, 43260) I understood that the image of Ganapati would not be kept in the gymnasium permanently.
('57', 23, 1, 27, 43348) I have already written to you about Manjula and cod liver oil.
('57', 23, 1, 28, 43411) 2 Pay attention to Indu’s condition.
('57', 23, 1, 29, 43448) If there is a danger of his losing his reason, the condition is likely to become extreme 3 .
('57', 23, 1, 30, 43541) But before that happens you should take steps to avert the possibility.

Khare”, 3 9 1932. 2 Vide “Letter to Narandas Gandhi”, 3/4/ 9 1932. 3 The portion of the letter from here onwards is placed in Bapuna Patro—9: Shri Narandas Gandhine, Pt. I, under September 3. This evidently is an error; Vide 4th footnote “Letter to Narandas Gandhi”, 3/4/9 1932.

('57', 24, 1, 2, 43970) The number in the Ashram is quite good.
('57', 24, 1, 3, 44010) It is very good indeed that Jamna 1 has stayed on in Rajkot.
('57', 24, 1, 4, 44071) I hope Devbhabhi 2 has fully recovered now.
('57', 24, 1, 5, 44115) Where is Virmani 3 kept?
('57', 24, 1, 6, 44140) Amtulbehn tells me in her letter that she liked my addressing her by her full name Amtussalaam in Urdu.
('57', 24, 1, 7, 44244) I am writing 4 to her to ask her why, but please know from her why she likes the full name and, if that is the right thing, all of you should address her by that name.
('57', 24, 1, 8, 44412) It is possible that there is no such name as ”Amtul”, and that ”Amtussalaam” is one single word just as we cannot say ”Ibra” instead of ”Ibrahim” or ”Brij” instead of ”Brijkrishna ”.
('57', 24, 1, 9, 44595) September 11, 1932 Dr. Sharma seems to want to come to the Ashram for a temporary stay.
('57', 24, 1, 10, 44683) Send him the list of the Ashram rules.
('57', 24, 1, 11, 44722) If he can observe them while he stays there, I see no objection to informing him that he may come.
('57', 24, 1, 12, 44821) However, do what you think best.
('57', 24, 1, 13, 44854) Read my letter 5 to Brijkrishna.
('57', 24, 1, 14, 44887) He is a man of pure heart.
('57', 24, 1, 15, 44914) Discuss the matter with him.
('57', 24, 1, 16, 44943) If it is possible to remove his suspicion, try to do so.
('57', 24, 1, 17, 45000) You must have got the postcard 6 which I wrote on Saturday asking you to send me information about how bread is made there.
('57', 24, 1, 18, 45124) I have started taking interest in the preparation of the bread here, and I, too, eat it.
('57', 24, 1, 19, 45213) The bread is excellent.
('57', 24, 1, 20, 45237) Perhaps ours is not better.
('57', 24, 1, 21, 45265) Read my letter to Sharda.
('57', 24, 1, 22, 45291) We have to think over the problem of the girls.
('57', 24, 1, 23, 45339) I think I can now guess the reason for their bad health.
('57', 24, 1, 24, 45396) We wish to train all these women who have had very little education, and it is for you to think how that can be done.
('57', 24, 1, 25, 45514) There are 52 letters in all, 37 in a bundle and 15 loose.
('57', 24, 3, 26, 45572) You will find my Will lying in some place there.
('57', 24, 3, 27, 45621) Send me a copy of it.
('57', 24, 3, 28, 45643) If it is sealed in a cover, break open the seal.
('57', 24, 3, 29, 45692) If you wish to make any suggestion about it, send it to me.

('57', 25, 5, 8, 46233) September 11, 1932
('57', 25, 6, 9, 46252) God and Nature are one.
('57', 25, 6, 10, 46276) The various gods are the individual manifestations of God.
('57', 25, 6, 11, 46335) One can reach God worshipping Him.
('57', 25, 6, 12, 46370) In depicting the importance of action Tulsidasji has extolled Divine justice.
('57', 25, 6, 13, 46448) God condones the sins of the devotee.
('57', 25, 6, 14, 46486) In the language of the Shastra the devotee is purified when he becomes one with God.
('57', 25, 6, 15, 46571) Purificaton means removal of sins, like alloys from gold.
('57', 25, 6, 16, 46629) A saint living in seclusion can perform service by thought alone; there is only one such man in a million.
('57', 25, 6, 17, 46736) The very existence of body stands in the way of total ahimsa.
('57', 25, 6, 18, 46798) And without complete ahimsa one is unable to see Truth.
('57', 25, 6, 19, 46854) But one who has rid himself of passions comes very near to Truth.
('57', 25, 6, 20, 46920) We should be content with this.
('57', 25, 6, 21, 46952) Up to now by punishment I have understood corporal punishment.
('57', 25, 6, 22, 47015) Abstaining from food has not been beyond my thought.
('57', 25, 6, 23, 47068) I would not call that a punishment.
('57', 25, 6, 24, 47104) No one in any institution has an absolute right to food; it is a question of arriving at an arrangement.
('57', 25, 6, 25, 47209) There is on the one hand the condition that rules are to be observed and on the other hand that food is to be supplied.
('57', 25, 6, 26, 47329) Money is no payment for the food we receive in an institution.
('57', 25, 6, 27, 47392) Rules have to be observed in exchange.
('57', 25, 6, 28, 47431) Fear and truth are mutually contradictory terms.
('57', 25, 6, 29, 47480) But to conceal something which does not contain any element of fear may be not only in conformity with truth but also necessary.
('57', 25, 6, 30, 47609) A physician may certainly, in the interest of the patient’s health, conceal from him the gravity of his illness.
('57', 25, 6, 31, 47722) It may even be his duty.
('57', 25, 6, 32, 47747) A perfect brahmachari is one who has all the senses under his control.
('57', 25, 6, 33, 47818) This state is possible even in this body.
('57', 25, 6, 34, 47860) Regulating diet is

('57', 26, 1, 2, 47928) necessary but it does not play an important part in the observance of brahmacharya.
('57', 26, 1, 3, 48012) Lack of self control is certainly detrimental.
('57', 26, 1, 4, 48059) I feel that milk and ghee taken by way of medicine are not harmful.

('57', 26, 5, 9, 48219) DEAR DAUGHTER AMTUSSALAAM, Explain to me why I should not call you only ‘Amtul’ 1. It is well if you receive the money you are expecting but you should be content even if it is not forthcoming.
('57', 26, 5, 10, 48413) Your letters are quite good, only you must write more legibly.
('57', 26, 5, 11, 48476) Anyway, after I have read a few of your letters I shall be able to follow everything.
('57', 26, 5, 12, 48562) It is astonishing to learn that there is no arrangement in Bombay for the education of girls; I had an idea that the Anjuman had pretty good provision.
('57', 26, 5, 13, 48714) Consult Narandas about Dr. Sharma I think there is no harm in his coming to the Ashram if he conforms to its rules.
('57', 26, 5, 14, 48830) I understand about Kudsia 2. How nice it would be if the girl gained her health in the Ashram!
('57', 26, 5, 15, 48925) As for you rest is the most important consideration.

('57', 26, 9, 20, 49139) I can under stand the feelings of the survivors.
('57', 26, 9, 21, 49188) But you should inculcate in them the fearlessness of death and its advent as that of a friend.
('57', 26, 9, 22, 49283) We, who should be most indifferent about death, somehow or other fear it more than other religious bodies.
('57', 26, 9, 23, 49390) Mussalmans appear to fear it the least.
('57', 26, 10, 24, 49430) 1 In some previous letters, Gandhiji had addressed her as ‘Amtul’ to which she seems to have objected; Vide “Letter to Narandas Gandhi”, 7 11 1932 Her full name consisted of two words ‘Amtul’, meaning ‘servant’, and ‘salaam’ meaning ‘peace’.

('57', 27, 13, 23, 50511) September 13, 1932 I believe that that is my supreme dharma.
('57', 27, 13, 24, 50572) Hence, neither Ramdas nor any of you should feel unhappy.
('57', 27, 13, 25, 50630) On the contrary, you should rejoice and thank God for His kindness that one of your co workers has been inspired to take the ultimate step in dharma and has got an opportunity to do that.
('57', 27, 13, 26, 50818) I hope all of you understand that nobody should imitate me.
('57', 27, 13, 27, 50878) Everybody is not fit to undertake an indefinite fast.
('57', 27, 13, 28, 50932) And the tapas performed by a person who is not fit for it is not in accord with the Shastra and is therefore demoniac.
('57', 27, 13, 29, 51051) His only reward for such tapas is physical suffering.
('57', 27, 13, 30, 51105) Your duty, therefore, is to do your work with greater devotion, to become purer and to remain

('57', 28, 2, 3, 51424) Nobody should get excited there.
('57', 28, 2, 4, 51457) Have no doubt that, for those who live in the Ashram, there is no other duty but what I have explained.
('57', 28, 3, 5, 51561) Rebirth means transformation of the body—not of the atman which dwells in the body.
('57', 28, 3, 6, 51645) Hence belief in rebirth differs from a scientific concept.
('57', 28, 3, 7, 51704) The atman does not undergo transformation, it only changes its abode.
('57', 28, 3, 8, 51774) One who does not regard himself as the doer will never kill anybody.
('57', 28, 3, 9, 51843) This is not a matter of intellectual conviction, it concerns the heart.
('57', 28, 3, 10, 51915) It is, therefore, incorrect to speak of “without thinking of oneself as the doer” or “dedicating a thing to the Lord”.
('57', 28, 3, 11, 52034) These phrases signify intellectual attitudes whereas the advice in the Gita and other scriptures to dedicate everything to the Lord has no reference to the intellect.
('57', 28, 3, 12, 52201) Our activities are in perfect accord with Vedanta as I understand it.

('57', 28, 6, 17, 52438) I assume that the news has not upset you in the slightest degree.
('57', 28, 6, 18, 52504) One does not get such a unique opportunity by seeking it.
('57', 28, 6, 19, 52562) It comes rarely, and only to a fortunate man.
('57', 28, 6, 20, 52608) I believe that such an opportunity has come to me, and anybody who believes that he has got a unique opportunity would welcome it heartily.
('57', 28, 6, 21, 52748) Hence you need not feel agitated.
('57', 28, 6, 22, 52782) If you meet Ghanshyamdas in Calcutta, explain this to him.
('57', 28, 6, 23, 52841) It will not be necessary to explain to Malaviyaji.
('57', 28, 6, 24, 52892) I believe that he must be shedding tears of joy at the news and that every moment his heart must be blessing me.
('57', 28, 6, 25, 53005) Tell him this.
('57', 28, 6, 26, 53020) If other friends feel sad or depressed, you should show courage and persuade them not to give way to such thoughts.
('57', 28, 6, 27, 53136) It will be the duty of those who appreciate my step to address themselves more earnestly to the task, to awaken the people to the evil of untouchability and to organize public opinion.
('57', 28, 6, 28, 53321) If a strong public opinion is organized and expressed peacefully, I may

('57', 29, 1, 3, 53700) So far as I know myself at present, I would experience nothing but the profoundest peace if I do have to carry the fast to its logical end.
('57', 29, 1, 4, 53840) If, on the contrary, that does not happen and I remain alive to serve the country still more, I will welcome that too.
('57', 29, 1, 5, 53959) Either result will be good if my resolution endures till the end.

('57', 29, 4, 9, 54104) September 13, 1932 I have your letter.
('57', 29, 4, 10, 54143) You have probably heard about my fast.
('57', 29, 4, 11, 54182) Do not get frightened in the slightest degree by the news and also do not let the other women get frightened.
('57', 29, 4, 12, 54292) Indeed, you should rejoice that God has granted me an opportunity to go through such an ordeal for the sake of dharma.
('57', 29, 4, 13, 54411) I also hope that you have understood the meaning of this fast.
('57', 29, 4, 14, 54474) I shall not have to start the fast if my demands regarding the Antyajas are accepted, and even if I have started it I can end it.
('57', 29, 4, 15, 54604) If, however, I have to carry it on till the end, you should indeed thank God.
('57', 29, 4, 16, 54682) Only one in millions meets death for which he has prayed.
('57', 29, 4, 17, 54740) What a good fortune it would be if I met such a death!
('57', 29, 4, 18, 54795) And if I do not die, it is clear as daylight that it would then be my moral duty to purify myself still further and to devote myself more to service.
('57', 29, 4, 19, 54945) I think that after having lived with me for fifty years you will be able clearly to understand this simple thing and willingly follow me.

('57', 29, 7, 23, 55163) September 13, 1932
('57', 29, 8, 24, 55182) NARANDAS, You must have read in the papers the news about my indefinite fast.
('57', 29, 8, 25, 55260) I assume that it has not created a panic among the inmates of the Ashram.
('57', 29, 8, 26, 55334) If they see the matter in the proper light, this should be for them an occasion for rejoicing.
('57', 29, 8, 27, 55429) A total fast is the ultimate and the highest ideal of the Ashram, but very few persons ever become worthy of the privilege of undertaking it.
('57', 29, 8, 28, 55571) Such a fast is not an everyday

('57', 30, 1, 2, 55651) occurrence.
('57', 30, 1, 3, 55663) Only a rare person on a rare occasion is entitled to undertake it; I believe that I am on this occasion.
('57', 30, 1, 4, 55768) If I am wrong, people will judge my step as a sign of false pride and an instance of demoniac self mortification.
('57', 30, 1, 5, 55882) I claim nearly half a century of ceaseless effort to purify my mind completely so that I may be able to hear the voice within.
('57', 30, 1, 6, 56009) I believe that as a result I can now hear it with some distinctness.
('57', 30, 1, 7, 56078) I have taken the present step in obedience to that voice.
('57', 30, 1, 8, 56136) The 20th is still a little way away.
('57', 30, 1, 9, 56173) At present the decision to fast is only a resolve.
('57', 30, 1, 10, 56224) I am writing this letter to explain that resolve, and to tell all of you that nobody there should get panicky, but that the news should make everybody more devoted to his or her work, purer and more awake.
('57', 30, 1, 11, 56430) I am sure you yourself do realize that nobody should follow my example and undertake a similar fast.
('57', 30, 1, 12, 56531) Explain that to others, too.
('57', 30, 1, 13, 56560) I hope nobody there will wonder why I kept my intention to fast to myself and did not let it become known beyond our circle of three.
('57', 30, 1, 14, 56694) It is a rule for prisoners that they must not make public the fact of such correspondence.
('57', 30, 1, 15, 56785) If I even wish in my heart to make it public indirectly, I would disgrace my satyagraha and there would be a blot on the purity of my vow of truth.
('57', 30, 1, 16, 56933) The value of that vow lies in the perfect purity in its observance.
('57', 30, 1, 17, 57001) I got your weekly packet.
('57', 30, 1, 18, 57027) I believe that this time at least I shall be able to send the replies.
('57', 30, 1, 19, 57098) I am slightly doubtful because during the days which remain the work is likely to be heavier.
('57', 30, 1, 20, 57192) If there is any development about which I can write to you, I will do so.
('57', 30, 1, 21, 57266) You can show this letter to all persons who have connections with the Ashram.
('57', 30, 1, 22, 57344) Tell Anandi that I intend to write a long letter to her.
('57', 30, 1, 23, 57401) I liked hers very much.
('57', 30, 1, 24, 57425) She should have no fear.
('57', 30, 1, 25, 57450) You should teach all girls to be fearless.
('57', 30, 1, 26, 57493) If people there are in the habit of whispering among themselves about any girl, it is a bad habit.
('57', 30, 1, 27, 57592) What is fated to happen to us and the girls will happen.
('57', 30, 1, 28, 57649) We should not feel suspicious about them all the time and fill them with fear.
('57', 30, 1, 29, 57728) When we see cause for cautioning any of them, we may do so and then should not think about the matter further.
('57', 30, 1, 30, 57839) The girls should never feel that they are being suppressed in any way.
('57', 30, 1, 31, 57910) Any restraints which are put on them should be explained to them and should be imposed in such a manner that they willingly accept them.
('57', 30, 1, 32, 58047) Personally, I think you have done the right thing in permitting Hariyomal to return.
('57', 30, 1, 33, 58132) I hope Baba has completely recovered now.

('57', 31, 4, 8, 58677) There need be no grief over the ordeal that ‘I have set before me at conscience’ call.
('57', 31, 4, 9, 58764) It is a privilege that rarely comes to one.
('57', 31, 4, 10, 58808) Having identified myself with our suppressed brethren for fifty years, I saw no escape from it.
('57', 31, 4, 11, 58904) If however God wants more service from me through this body, He will make the way clear for me.
('57', 31, 4, 12, 59000) And why no faith in prayer?
('57', 31, 4, 13, 59028) Faith is either derived or revealed from within.
('57', 31, 4, 14, 59077) You should derive it from the testimony without exception of all the teachers and seers of all climes, countries and times.
('57', 31, 4, 15, 59201) A true prayer is not a mere lip expression.
('57', 31, 4, 16, 59245) It need never be.
('57', 31, 4, 17, 59263) Selfless service is prayer.
('57', 31, 4, 18, 59291) You must not say, ‘I have no faith in prayer’.

('57', 32, 9, 18, 60768) You will see in my reply to Rajagopalachari that I have said that he could come whenever he chooses.
('57', 32, 9, 19, 60869) 3 This I have done in the belief that the fact of your sending me a telegram asking for interview presupposes authority for you to grant it.

('57', 33, 2, 3, 61585) September 15, 1932 CHI.
('57', 33, 2, 4, 61609) MIRA, I had been waiting for your letter.
('57', 33, 2, 5, 61651) It arrived today.
('57', 33, 2, 6, 61669) I am glad you have understood the reason for the fast.
('57', 33, 2, 7, 61724) There was no escape from it.
('57', 33, 2, 8, 61753) It is both a privilege and a duty.
('57', 33, 2, 9, 61788) It comes rarely to someone in a generation or generations.
('57', 33, 2, 10, 61847) In non violence it is the crowning act, if it is saturated with that spirit and the cause has no trace of self.
('57', 33, 2, 11, 61959) I ask you, therefore, to rejoice with me that such an occasion seems to have come to me.
('57', 33, 2, 12, 62048) I say ‘seems’ for my faith has yet to be tried.
('57', 33, 2, 13, 62096) No one can dare talk of his own strength in a matter of life and death.The question, therefore, is whether I am found worthy of the needed strength and also whether the cause is of the required purity and thirdly, whether in truth I am free of every trace of violence in undertaking the vow.
('57', 33, 2, 14, 62388) When I say that I feel like all that, I merely statemy belief.
('57', 33, 2, 15, 62451) Judgment can be pronounced only upon the completed act.
('57', 33, 2, 16, 62507) I want you to watch the progress of the event without the slightest perturbation.
('57', 33, 2, 17, 62589) Nor may you at any stage fast in sympathy.
('57', 33, 2, 18, 62632) Yours is to be buried in your own task which is to go through your term in full resignation, making the best use possible of every moment at your disposal.
('57', 33, 2, 19, 62788) I do not mind the drop in your weight if you are otherwise well and fit.
('57', 33, 2, 20, 62861) The weight will come gradually as you become acclimatized there and the weather improves, which it will not do for yet another month.
('57', 33, 2, 21, 62995) For me, I am as fit as a fiddle.
('57', 33, 2, 22, 63028) Just now my food is brown bread, milk, a vegetable, local dates (not bad) and musambis.
('57', 33, 2, 23, 63116) I am glad Kisen is with you.
('57', 33, 2, 24, 63145) You must be a fair size family now.
('57', 33, 2, 25, 63181) I know that you had naturally the art of looking upon trees and animals as friends.
('57', 33, 2, 26, 63265) I wanted you to extend the idea so as not to feel the want of friends from outside.
('57', 33, 2, 27, 63349) Hence my mention of strangers in the same category.
('57', 33, 2, 28, 63401) That is to say, there should be a definite realization that personal friends and relations are no greater friends than strangers of the human family and bird, beast and plant.
('57', 33, 2, 29, 63577) They are all one, and they are all an expression of God if we would but realize the fact.
('57', 33, 2, 30, 63667) Such definite realization assuages all craving for seeing outside friends when we are inside prison walls.
('57', 33, 2, 31, 63774) The news you have from England about the family is cheering.
('57', 33, 2, 32, 63835) Send my love to them all when you write.

('57', 34, 1, 5, 64130) The mother has a fancy for vegetarian dishes.

('57', 34, 1, 7, 64227) We have an addition to the family, did I tell you?
('57', 34, 1, 8, 64278) There was a human touch about the mother whilst she was in pain and two or three days after delivery.
('57', 34, 1, 9, 64380) She would caress us and insist on being caressed.
('57', 34, 1, 10, 64430) It was a pathetic sight.
('57', 34, 1, 11, 64455) The care she bestows on the ‘baby’ is very wonderful.

('57', 34, 4, 17, 64711) September 15, 1932 I think Satyavan’s 1 problem is simple.
('57', 34, 4, 18, 64770) No person can go beyond his or her limits.
('57', 34, 4, 19, 64813) You cannot force anyone to be chaste.
('57', 34, 4, 20, 64851) He or she must have the inner conviction.
('57', 34, 4, 21, 64893) You can give him the fullest freedom to separate himself from you and get a divorce decree if necessary.
('57', 34, 4, 22, 64998) He must be at liberty to marry some other woman of his choice.
('57', 34, 4, 23, 65061) It is most dangerous to have a carnal mind constantly brooding over satisfaction of animal passion.
('57', 34, 4, 24, 65161) You must surround him with all the affection you can give him and not judge him harshly.
('57', 34, 4, 25, 65250) It is to his credit that he has striven all these years to control himself.
('57', 34, 4, 26, 65326) Of course if you have the slightest desire to satisfy his craving, you should regard yourself at liberty to do so.
('57', 34, 4, 27, 65441) For you both came to a joint conclusion about self control.
('57', 34, 4, 28, 65501) If now one party wishes to revise the agreement, the other may also, if there is the desire.
('57', 34, 4, 29, 65594) Whereas if you are satisfied that you have no craving at all, you must resist every entreaty from Satyavan as lovingly as possible, but with the utmost firmness.
('57', 34, 4, 30, 65756) Let him read this letter.
('57', 34, 4, 31, 65782) Let him think over it and pray to God for light.
('57', 34, 4, 32, 65831) And if he finds that he cannot bring his passion under subjection, he must take another wife if you have no wish to surrender.
('57', 34, 4, 33, 65958) You should part as friends.

('57', 38, 2, 7, 70087) It was a peremptory call from God which I could not resist.
('57', 38, 2, 8, 70147) I hope you had no difficulty in appreciating the step.

('57', 38, 2, 11, 70337) Supposing that this proves my last letter to you, let me tell you that my faith in Hindu Muslim unity is as green as ever and that I feel the richer for having many Muslim friends who are as blood brothers to me.

('57', 38, 5, 14, 70611) September 16, 1932 1
('57', 38, 6, 15, 70632) The fast which I am approaching was resolved upon in the name of God for His work and, as I believed in all humility, at His call.
('57', 38, 6, 16, 70763) Friends have urged me to postpone the date for the sake of giving the public a chance to organize itself.
('57', 38, 6, 17, 70869) I am sorry it is not open to me to change even the hour, except for the reason stated in my letter to the Prime Minister.
('57', 38, 7, 18, 70991) The impending fast is against those who have faith in me, whether Indians or foreigners, and for those who have it not.
('57', 38, 7, 19, 71111) Therefore it is not against the English official world, but it is against those Englishmen and women who in spite of the contrary teaching of
('57', 38, 8, 20, 71253) 1 According to a report in The Bombay Chronicle, 22 9 1932, and The Epic Fast, the statement was sent to the Government of Bombay on September 15 for being released to the Press.
('57', 38, 8, 21, 71432) However, the statement signed by Gandhiji bears the date “16 9 32” in his own handwriting.
('57', 38, 8, 22, 71523) Vide also the following item.
('57', 38, 8, 23, 71553) 2 The reason stated was: “The fast will cease if during its progress, the British Government of its own motion or under pressure of public opinion revise their decision and withdraw their scheme of communal electorates for the ‘depressed’ classes, whose representatives should be elected by the general electorate under the common franchise no matter how wide it is.” Vide “Letter to Ramsay Macdonald”, 18 8 1932. For Gandhiji’s further views on the Communal Award and Untouchability, Vide Appendix “Discussion with Vallabhbhai Patel”, 6 9 1932.
('57', 39, 0, 1, 72099) 40 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 39, 1, 2, 72140) the official world, believe in me and the justice of the cause I represent.
('57', 39, 1, 3, 72216) Nor is it against those of my countrymen who have no faith in me, whether they be Hindus or others; but it is against those countless Indians (no matter to what persuasion they belong) who believe that I represent a just cause.
('57', 39, 1, 4, 72444) Above all, it is intended to sting the Hindu conscience into right religious action.
('57', 39, 1, 5, 72529) The contemplated fast is no appeal to mere emotion.
('57', 39, 1, 6, 72581) By the fast I want to throw the whole of my weight (such as it is) in the scales of justice pure and simple.
('57', 39, 1, 7, 72690) Therefore, there need be no undue haste or feverish anxiety to save my life.
('57', 39, 1, 8, 72767) I implicitly believe in the truth of the saying that not a blade of grass moves but by His will.
('57', 39, 1, 9, 72864) He will save it if He needs it for further service in this body.
('57', 39, 1, 10, 72929) None can save it against His will.
('57', 39, 1, 11, 72964) Humanly speaking, I believe it will stand the strain for some time.
('57', 39, 1, 12, 73032) The separate electorate is merely the last straw.
('57', 39, 1, 13, 73082) No patched up agreement between caste Hindu leaders and rival “depressed” class leaders will answer the purpose.
('57', 39, 1, 14, 73195) The agreement to be valid has got to be real.
('57', 39, 1, 15, 73241) If the Hindu mass mind is not yet prepared to banish untouchability root and branch, it must sacrifice me without the slightest hesitation.
('57', 39, 1, 16, 73381) There should be no coercion of those who are opposed to joint electorates.
('57', 39, 1, 17, 73456) I have no difficulty in understanding their bitter opposition.
('57', 39, 1, 18, 73519) They have every right to distrust me.
('57', 39, 1, 19, 73557) Do I not belong to that Hindu section miscalled a superior class, or caste Hindus, who have ground down to powder the so called untouchables?
('57', 39, 1, 20, 73699) The marvel is that the latter have remained nevertheless in the Hindu fold.
('57', 39, 1, 21, 73775) But whilst I can justify this opposition, I believe that they are in error.
('57', 39, 1, 22, 73851) They will, if they can, separate the “depressed” class entirely from the Hindu society and form them into a separate class—a standing and living reproach to Hinduism.
('57', 39, 1, 23, 74018) I should not mind if thereby their interests could be really served.
('57', 39, 1, 24, 74087) But my intimate acquaintance with every shade of untouch ability convinces me that their lives, such as they are, are so intimately mixed with those of the caste Hindus in whose midst and for whom they live, that it is impossible to separate them.
('57', 39, 1, 25, 74335) They are part of an indivisible family.
('57', 39, 1, 26, 74375) Their revolt against the Hindus with whom they live and their apostasy from Hinduism I should understand.
('57', 39, 1, 27, 74481) But this so far as I can see they will not do.
('57', 39, 1, 28, 74528) There is a subtle something—quite indefinable— in Hinduism which keeps them in it even in spite of themselves.
('57', 40, 0, 1, 74639) VOL. 57 : 5 SEPTEMBER, 1932 15 NOVEMBER, 1932 41
('57', 40, 1, 2, 74688) And this fact makes it imperative for a man like me, with a living experience of it, to resist the contemplated separation even though the effort should cost life itself.
('57', 40, 1, 3, 74859) The implications of this resistance are tremendous.
('57', 40, 1, 4, 74911) No comp romise which does not ensure the full freedom for the “depressed classes” inside the Hindu fold can be an adequate substitute for the contemplated separation.
('57', 40, 1, 5, 75078) Any betrayal of the trust can merely postpone the day of immolation for me and henceforth for those who think with me.
('57', 40, 1, 6, 75197) The problem before responsible Hindus is to consider whether in the event of social, civic or political persecution of the “depressed” classes they are prepared to face satyagraha in the shape of perpetual fast, not of one reformer like me, but an increasing army of reformers whom I believe to exist today in India and who will count their lives of no cost to achieve the liberation of these classes and therethrough [rid] Hinduism of an age long superstition.
('57', 40, 1, 7, 75659) Let fellow reformers who have worked with me also appreciate the implications of the fast.
('57', 40, 1, 8, 75750) It is either a hallucination of mine or an illumination.
('57', 40, 1, 9, 75807) If it is the former, I must be allowed to do my penance in peace.
('57', 40, 1, 10, 75873) It will be the lifting of a dead weight on Hinduism.
('57', 40, 1, 11, 75926) If it is an illumination, may my agony purify Hinduism and even melt the hearts of those who are at present disposed to distrust me.
('57', 40, 1, 12, 76059) Since there appears to be a misunderstanding as to the application of my fast, I may repeat that it is aimed at a statutory separate electorate, in any shape or form, for the “depressed” classes.
('57', 40, 1, 13, 76255) Immediately that threat is removed once for all, my fast will end.
('57', 40, 1, 14, 76322) I hold strong views about reservation of seats, as also about the most proper method of dealing with the whole question.
('57', 40, 1, 15, 76443) But I consider myself unfit as a prisoner to set forth my proposals.
('57', 40, 1, 16, 76512) I should however abide by an agreement on the basis of joint electorate that may be arrived at between the responsible leaders of caste Hindus and the “depressed” classes and which has been accepted by mass meetings of all Hindus.
('57', 40, 1, 17, 76743) One thing I must make clear.
('57', 40, 1, 18, 76772) The satisfactory ending to the “depressed” classes question, if it is to come, should in no way mean that I would be committed to the acceptance of His Majesty’s Government’s decision on the other parts of the communal question.
('57', 40, 1, 19, 77001) I am personally opposed to many other parts of it, which to my mind make the working of any free and democratic constitution well nigh impossible, nor would a satisfactory solution of this question in any
('57', 41, 0, 1, 77206) 42 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 41, 1, 2, 77247) way bind me to accept the constitution that may be framed.
('57', 41, 1, 3, 77306) These are political questions for the National Congress to consider and determine.
('57', 41, 1, 4, 77389) They are utterly outside my province in my individual capacity.
('57', 41, 1, 5, 77453) Nor may I as a prisoner air my individual views on these questions.
('57', 41, 1, 6, 77521) My fast has a narrow application.
('57', 41, 1, 7, 77555) The “depressed” classes question being predominantly a religious matter, I regard it as specially my own by reason of my lifelong concentration on it.
('57', 41, 1, 8, 77706) It is a sacred personal trust which I may not shirk.
('57', 41, 1, 9, 77759) The fasting for light and penance is a hoary institution.
('57', 41, 1, 10, 77817) I have observed it in Christianity and Islam.
('57', 41, 1, 11, 77863) Hinduism is replete with instances of fasting for purification and penance.
('57', 41, 1, 12, 77939) But it is a privilege, if it is also a duty.
('57', 41, 1, 13, 77984) Moreover, to the best of my light, I have reduced it to a science.
('57', 41, 1, 14, 78051) As an expert, therefore, I would warn friends and sympathizers against copying me blindly or out of false or hysterical sympathy.
('57', 41, 1, 15, 78181) Let all such qualify themselves by hard work and selfless service of the “untouchables” and they would have independent light if their time for fasting has come.
('57', 41, 1, 16, 78343) Lastly, in so far as I know myself this fast is being undertaken with the purest of motives and without malice or anger to any single soul.
('57', 41, 1, 17, 78483) For me it is an expression of, and the last seal on, non violence.
('57', 41, 1, 18, 78550) Those, therefore, who would use violence in this controversy against those whom they may consider to be inimical to me or the cause I represent will simply hasten my end.
('57', 41, 1, 19, 78721) Perfect courtesy and conside ration towards opponents is an absolute essential of success in this case 1 at least if not in all cases.

('57', 46, 11, 23, 85828) DEAR MOTHER, SINGER AND GUARDIAN OF MY SOUL, Your lovely letter was preceded by one lovelier—if possible— from Padmaja.
('57', 46, 11, 24, 85948) The decision was taken after much prayer, in the name of God and at His call.
('57', 46, 11, 25, 86026) I have no power therefore to postpone the hour of execution.

('57', 47, 0, 1, 86130) 48 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 47, 1, 2, 86171) You have every right to call upon me to revise my decisions and actions and it is my duty to respond, if I discover the error.
('57', 47, 1, 3, 86298) And I claim unquestioned ‘obedience’ if I cannot with all the prayerful effort discover any error.
('57', 47, 1, 4, 86397) You have ‘manfully’ asserted the right and woman like offered obedience.
('57', 47, 1, 5, 86470) The motherly affection has blinded the poetic vision and prom pted you to appeal to my pride to retrace my steps so as to make me cling to life.
('57', 47, 1, 6, 86615) But I know you have not missed the woman in me.
('57', 47, 1, 7, 86663) I have therefore chosen the way of life through suffering unto death.
('57', 47, 1, 8, 86733) I must therefore find my courage in my weakness.
('57', 47, 1, 9, 86782) This is how your vision has failed you.
('57', 47, 1, 10, 86822) The communal decision was the last straw.
('57', 47, 1, 11, 86864) The conception of giving my life for the untouchables is not of yesterday.
('57', 47, 1, 12, 86939) It is very old.
('57', 47, 1, 13, 86955) There was no call from within for years.
('57', 47, 1, 14, 86996) But the Cabinet’s decision came like a violent alarm waking me from my slumber and telling me this is the time.
('57', 47, 1, 15, 87108) It therefore provided the psychological moment and I instinctively seized it.
('57', 47, 1, 16, 87186) The necessarily restricted wording of my official letter covers in their implications the very things you would have me to die for and to live for—one and the same thing in essence.
('57', 47, 1, 17, 87368) She who sees life in death and death in life is the real Poetess and Seeress.
('57', 47, 1, 18, 87446) But the proof of the pudding is in the eating.
('57', 47, 1, 19, 87493) You will soon test it and prove it for yourself.
('57', 47, 1, 20, 87542) Meanwhile pray that God may give me strength enough to walk steadily through the vale.
('57', 47, 1, 21, 87629) If Hinduism is to live, untouchability must die.
('57', 47, 1, 22, 87678) It may be that this is my last letter to you.
('57', 47, 1, 23, 87724) I have always known and treasured your love.
('57', 47, 1, 24, 87769) I think that I understood you when I first saw you and heard you at the Criterion in 1914. If I die I shall die in the faith that comrades like you, with whom God has blessed me, will continue the work of the country which is also fully the work of humanity in the same spirit in which it was begun.
('57', 47, 1, 25, 88069) If the interests of the country are to be one with those of humanity, if the good of one faith is to be the good of all faiths, it will come only by the strictest adherence to truth and non violence in thought, word and deed.
('57', 47, 1, 26, 88295) And now for a little lesson in recognizing one’s limitations.
('57', 47, 1, 27, 88357) You may be a good confectioner, but you need not therefore presume to be a good baker or a judge of good bread.
('57', 47, 1, 28, 88469) Well, my brown bread is really superior to your ‘good white bread’.

('57', 48, 10, 19, 89503) BHAI BARJORJI, I was not surprised to get your wire.
('57', 48, 10, 20, 89556) But the truth is that no person can resolve on an indefinite fast relying on his own strength, and that if he does so he must be an ignorant man.
('57', 48, 10, 21, 89702) For myself at any rate I can say that I did not take the vow, but that God inspired me to take it.
('57', 48, 10, 22, 89801) The date too was fixed by Him, and so also the conditions under which the date could be changed.
('57', 48, 10, 23, 89898) Your appeal is not covered by those conditions.
('57', 48, 10, 24, 89946) What can I do now?
('57', 48, 10, 25, 89965) Another simple thing is this: a prisoner cannot himself comm unicate anything to the world outside.
('57', 48, 10, 26, 90065) Hence, it would have been a sin for me, a satyagrahi, to convey indirectly to the nation even the slightest hint of what I had in my mind.

('57', 49, 1, 2, 90310) voluntarily obeys prison rules and, if it becomes necessary for him to disobey any of them, he can only do so openly.
('57', 49, 1, 3, 90428) Thus, the notice given by me as a prisoner to the Government should be regarded as a notice given to the people also.
('57', 49, 1, 4, 90546) That is, it was for the Government to decide whether it would inform the public about my intention.
('57', 49, 1, 5, 90646) If the people did not know of it earlier, we should interpret the fact only to mean that God did not intend the people to know it earlier.
('57', 49, 1, 6, 90785) How can I postpone the date of the fast in order to give time to the people?
('57', 49, 1, 7, 90862) Why should not those who have faith in God rather think that if it is His will that I should serve more yet, He would in spite of the fast spare my life for as long as may be necessary?
('57', 49, 1, 8, 91048) And you certainly have faith in God.
('57', 49, 1, 9, 91085) You should, therefore, try to understand what I have said in this letter and explain it to the men and women who get agitated over my decision and give them courage.
('57', 49, 1, 10, 91251) My co workers’ duty at present is to go on vigorously with the work that now faces us.
('57', 49, 1, 11, 91338) The result is in God’s hands.
('57', 49, 1, 12, 91368) Remember this, that my fast cannot be, and certainly is not, intended for putting pressure on any party.
('57', 49, 1, 13, 91473) Its purpose is only to see that what is in the best interests of the Antyajas themselves is done.
('57', 49, 1, 14, 91571) If what seems proper to me does not appear so to others, they should indeed continue their opposition.
('57', 49, 1, 15, 91674) Such pure fast for a public cause should aim at bringing about an awakening in the nation and should not, at any rate, be used ignorantly to lead the people on a wrong path.
('57', 49, 1, 16, 91848) If, in my ignorance, I try through a fast to make the nation agree to an improper demand, I am sure that the nation ought not to yield to such a demand merely for sparing my life, no matter how much it is convinced of my services to it in the past.
('57', 49, 1, 17, 92097) Not only the good of the nation, but my own good too, lies in its not yielding to an improper demand by me.

('57', 50, 5, 12, 93200) Still, do write to me and ask me if you can come.
('57', 50, 5, 13, 93250) I will see if I can let you.
('57', 50, 5, 14, 93279) If, however, that is not possible, then think that nothing is gained by meeting an image of clay.
('57', 50, 5, 15, 93377) It is the minds and the hearts that meet and they have the power to meet in a secend even when the bodies dwell farthest away from each other.
('57', 50, 5, 16, 93520) Even if the bodies are very close to each other, they are as distant from each other as the North Pole is from the South if the minds and the hearts do not meet.
('57', 50, 5, 17, 93682) Therefore the nearness of the bodies has little meaning.
('57', 50, 5, 18, 93739) It is only because there is a soul living in the body that we wish to meet each other.
('57', 50, 5, 19, 93826) This, indeed, is the strongest infatuation and till we are free from it we are held in chains even stronger than steel.
('57', 50, 5, 20, 93946) But it is not enough to understand this with our intellect.
('57', 50, 5, 21, 94006) The knowledge should sink into the heart.
('57', 50, 5, 22, 94048) If that happens, one has attained everything worth attaining.
('57', 50, 5, 23, 94110) But one has to struggle during many lives to acquire this knowledge, and even then only a few succeed in acquiring it.
('57', 50, 5, 24, 94229) Hence the Gita teaches, by implication, that one should wear away one’s body doing one’s duty.
('57', 50, 5, 25, 94324) It is only in this way that one can learn non attachment or become free from infatuation.

('57', 51, 4, 12, 95026) 78. A LETTER
('57', 51, 5, 13, 95039) September 17, 1932
('57', 51, 6, 14, 95058) CHI., Your letter is absurd.
('57', 51, 6, 15, 95087) On the one hand, you talk about undertaking a fast and, on the other, about marrying.
('57', 51, 6, 16, 95173) You are too young, and not yet fit, to undertake a fast.
('57', 51, 6, 17, 95230) So long as you are not married you may certainly write innocent letters to the young man to whom you are betrothed, after obtaining your parents’ consent.
('57', 51, 6, 18, 95385) I have deliberately used the word ‘innocent’.
('57', 51, 6, 19, 95431) It is a sin to nurse a desire which is not going to be ful filled in the present.
('57', 51, 6, 20, 95513) One’s mental strength is unnecessarily wasted by doing that.
('57', 51, 6, 21, 95574) It is not at all wise to waste it in such a manner.
('57', 51, 6, 22, 95626) I do not know your age.
('57', 51, 6, 23, 95650) If you have really come of age, and if you are a prey to passion, I would prefer that you should get married immediately.
('57', 51, 6, 24, 95772) If you are not yet of marriageable age, then you should control your passion and should not be eager to write letters to your future husband.
('57', 51, 6, 25, 95914) I think this will solve all your problems.

('57', 54, 3, 5, 97812) It has been followed by loving sermon from Mother.
('57', 54, 3, 6, 97863) You must not consider me so proud as not to need the prayers of ‘friends, comrades and playmates’.
('57', 54, 3, 7, 97962) Indeed God is nearer to me than the air which surrounds me and which I breathe.
('57', 54, 3, 8, 98042) But I sense His invisible presence in the prayers of the innocent.
('57', 54, 3, 9, 98109) They sustain me.
('57', 54, 3, 10, 98126) Do therefore pray that He may give me the strength to pass through the firey ordeal that awaits me.

('57', 57, 3, 5, 101635) I hope you have fully grasped the significance of my fast unto death.
('57', 57, 3, 6, 101705) Be brave and do not lose heart.
('57', 57, 3, 7, 101737) You must not slacken in your labour.
('57', 57, 3, 8, 101774) What do we gain by clinging to the body?
('57', 57, 3, 9, 101815) We daily recite in the Ashram verses which tell us to give up attachment to the body.
('57', 57, 3, 10, 101901) We have got this opportunity to demonstrate that we have assimilated the lesson of the verses which we daily recite.

('57', 57, 7, 22, 102752) Such an opportunity comes rarely to anyone.
('57', 57, 7, 23, 102796) I hope that the effect of the fast on you both will be to increase your self control and your devotion to service.
('57', 57, 7, 24, 102911) Do not let yourself be made unhappy by your financial difficulties.
('57', 57, 7, 25, 102979) Resign yourself to the misfortune.
('57', 57, 7, 26, 103014) God will protect my body if He wants to take more work from it, otherwise He will let it perish.

('57', 58, 7, 14, 104101) Sooner or later, one has got to give up the body.

('57', 59, 2, 4, 104927) On the contrary, you should rejoice that God has granted to a co worker a holy opportunity like this.
('57', 59, 2, 5, 105029) Such an opportunity comes rarely to anybody.
('57', 59, 2, 6, 105074) Moreover, God will keep me alive if He wants this body to do more service still.
('57', 59, 2, 7, 105155) If, on the contrary, my time is up, I shall not live even though I may be eating as usual.

('57', 59, 5, 11, 105327) September 18, 1932
('57', 59, 6, 12, 105346) VASUMATI, So at last I got a long letter from you.
('57', 59, 6, 13, 105397) But I am sure you do not expect from me a long reply now.
('57', 59, 6, 14, 105455) Look, do not let my fast make you unhappy.
('57', 59, 6, 15, 105498) Cultivate great devotion to service.
('57', 59, 6, 16, 105535) I have always known that you have the strength to sacrifice your life.
('57', 59, 6, 17, 105606) God will grant you all strength.
('57', 59, 6, 18, 105639) Never lose heart.

('57', 59, 9, 20, 105743) 96. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
('57', 59, 10, 21, 105773) September 18/19, 1932
('57', 59, 11, 22, 105795) NARANDAS, It is two o’clock now.
('57', 59, 11, 23, 105828) I am observing silence.
('57', 59, 11, 24, 105852) I got your letter about bread.
('57', 59, 11, 25, 105883) I also got your weekly mail.
('57', 59, 11, 26, 105912) As you say, God’s ways are indeed inscrutable.
('57', 59, 11, 27, 105959) I believe that I am dancing as a puppet in His hands.
('57', 59, 11, 28, 106013) Hence I feel no burden on my mind.
('57', 59, 11, 29, 106048) If only I could pass the final test in this same manner !
('57', 59, 11, 30, 106106) I will live as He wills.
('57', 59, 11, 31, 106131) I wish everybody there to remain cheerful to the very end, to do his daily work with
('57', 59, 12, 32, 106216) 1 Wife of Dr. Jivraj Mehta and a former Vice Chancellor of M. S. University, Baroda.
('57', 60, 0, 1, 106301) VOL. 57 : 5 SEPTEMBER, 1932 15 NOVEMBER, 1932 61
('57', 60, 1, 2, 106350) greater devotion and not be agitated.
('57', 60, 1, 3, 106388) None should feel anxious what news he may hear the following day.
('57', 60, 1, 4, 106454) Everybody should be ready for anything that may happen.
('57', 60, 1, 5, 106510) The best way of maintaining such a state of mind is to be completely absorbed in the work which one may be doing at any moment.
('57', 60, 1, 6, 106638) I do not know what will happen on Tuesday.
('57', 60, 1, 7, 106681) Nirmala 1 has written to me from Rajkot.
('57', 60, 1, 8, 106722) She says in her letter that, when Aunt 2 had got herself operated upon for cataract of the eye, the expenses were paid by you.
('57', 60, 1, 9, 106849) I suppose you did that from theAshram funds.
('57', 60, 1, 10, 106894) She has again to get herself operated upon.
('57', 60, 1, 11, 106938) Look into this matter and do what is necessary.
('57', 60, 1, 12, 106986) I have been looking after many things regarding Champa and Ratilal.
('57', 60, 1, 13, 107054) If, however, the whole burden falls on you, I know that God has given you the strength to shoulder it.
('57', 60, 1, 14, 107157) I suppose you know that a sum of Rs. 25,000 is deposited in Champa’s name with Revashan kerbhai 3. Most probably the receipt for that sum is with Champa.
('57', 60, 1, 15, 107311) The Doctor’s last draft of his Will is unsigned.
('57', 60, 1, 16, 107360) I will see that you get it.
('57', 60, 1, 17, 107388) If I forget, please get it.
('57', 60, 1, 18, 107416) According to it, they two should get Rs. 50,000 each, and the red bungalow is for them both.
('57', 60, 1, 19, 107509) The Doctor has left a list of the names of trustees, but Chhaganlal has suggested other names and I approve of them.
('57', 60, 1, 20, 107626) But no matter who are appointed, this burden will fall on the Ashram.
('57', 60, 1, 21, 107696) A gift of Rs. 6,500 has been made to the Ashram in memory of the Doctor.
('57', 60, 1, 22, 107769) Chhaganlal wrote some time ago requesting that the sum be paid, but had added that it might be done only after the arrangements about the property left by the Doctor had been completed.
('57', 60, 1, 23, 107955) Besides Chhaganlal, Nanalal knows all this.
('57', 60, 1, 24, 107999) You may consult him whenever you cannot understand something.
('57', 60, 2, 25, 108061) 8.30 p.m.
('57', 60, 3, 26, 108071) I had a letter from Kasumba 4 in which she has poured out her grief.
('57', 60, 3, 27, 108140) She wants the girls to be sent back to her.
('57', 60, 3, 28, 108184) The girls, too, have written to me.
('57', 60, 3, 29, 108220) They say that they do not feel happy in the Ashram.
('57', 60, 3, 30, 108272) Have a frank talk with them and, if you find that they really wish to go to their mother, I think they should be permitted to go.
('57', 60, 3, 31, 108402) Discuss the
('57', 60, 4, 32, 108414) 1 Daughter in law of Raliatbehn, Gandhiji’s sister.
('57', 60, 4, 33, 108466) 2 Raliatbehn.
('57', 60, 4, 34, 108480) 3 Dr. Pranjivan Mehta’s brother.
('57', 60, 4, 35, 108513) 4 Jaisukhlal Gandhi’s wife.
('57', 61, 0, 1, 108541) 62 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 61, 1, 2, 108582) matter with Jaisukhlal and do what you think proper.
('57', 61, 1, 3, 108635) Go through my letters to him.
('57', 61, 2, 4, 108665) 4.15 a.m., Silence Day [September 19, 1932]
('57', 61, 3, 5, 108709) After doing the morning prayer and walking for some time, I am now writing letters to the Ashram.
('57', 61, 3, 6, 108807) The more letters I write, the more I discover those that remain to be written.
('57', 61, 3, 7, 108886) I will write as many as I can.
('57', 61, 3, 8, 108917) Nobody should feel disappointed if he or she does not get a letter.
('57', 61, 3, 9, 108985) A person with a large family is happy beyond measure but he also becomes miserable.
('57', 61, 3, 10, 109069) Anybody who does not get a letter should not envy somebody who gets one; a letter received by one has been received by all of them.
('57', 61, 3, 11, 109201) Only those who see no difference between themselves and others even in such small matters will succeed ultimately in forgetting it completely.
('57', 61, 3, 12, 109344) Anybody who cannot count one, cannot do sums involving millions.
('57', 61, 3, 13, 109409) I am trying to write as many letters as I can and thereby feel one in my heart with the inmates of the Ashram.
('57', 61, 3, 14, 109520) I am drawing the soul of the Ashram into myself and pouring my soul into the people there.
('57', 61, 3, 15, 109611) I will send with this almost all the letters which I shall write this time.
('57', 61, 3, 16, 109687) Read all the letters.
('57', 61, 3, 17, 109709) Do not let the routine of the Ashram work be broken even for a minute.
('57', 61, 3, 18, 109780) Nobody should get confused in mind or feel unhappy.
('57', 61, 3, 19, 109832) Everybody should strive ceaselessly to make himself worthy of complete fulfilment of the aim of the fast.
('57', 61, 3, 20, 109938) My own worthiness in that regard still remains to be proved.
('57', 61, 3, 21, 109999) Solon spoke the perfect truth when he said : “Call no man happy or good till he be dead.” Who can say that my self suffering is not a demoniac mortification of the self?
('57', 61, 3, 22, 110169) It must be counted so if deep in my heart I harbour ill will or anger against anybody or there is an element of selfishness in my motive.
('57', 61, 3, 23, 110307) If so, my self suffering will be a curse on the world.
('57', 61, 3, 24, 110362) I am sure all of you will be ready to testify for me and say that, if my vow was prompted by ill will or any such unworthy motive, I was altogether unconscious of the fact and that I had taken the vow knowing it to be perfectly pure.
('57', 61, 3, 25, 110596) All this that I am writing may even prove to be unnecessary.
('57', 61, 3, 26, 110657) It is possible that the efforts of the nation may bear fruit and that my fast may not have to be continued to the logical end.
('57', 61, 3, 27, 110784) If these efforts succeed, we should welcome the result.
('57', 61, 3, 28, 110840) But I cannot assume while writing this letter that that will be so.
('57', 61, 3, 29, 110908) I must write it assuming that this body will perish.
('57', 62, 0, 1, 110961) VOL. 57 : 5 SEPTEMBER, 1932 15 NOVEMBER, 1932 63
('57', 62, 1, 2, 111010) I got a very forceful letter from Rambhau.
('57', 62, 1, 3, 111053) Read my reply 1 to him.
('57', 62, 1, 4, 111077) I see from his letter that, if we can remove the layers of dirt which cover his heart, he is likely to reveal himself a real jewel.
('57', 62, 1, 5, 111209) It is a difficult task.
('57', 62, 1, 6, 111233) But since you have taken him in hand, he may be able to reveal the worth which lies hidden in him at present.

('57', 62, 12, 19, 111732) RAMBHAU, I liked your letter very much.
('57', 62, 12, 20, 111772) You have used all your ability in writing it.
('57', 62, 12, 21, 111818) The handwriting is beautiful, and the language also is equally good.
('57', 62, 12, 22, 111887) You seem to have an excellent gift for writing.
('57', 62, 12, 23, 111935) There is plenty of humour in what you write and you can make it very biting.
('57', 62, 12, 24, 112012) I can see even from here the faults you have pointed out in Premabehn.
('57', 62, 12, 25, 112083) But you cannot see your own faults or maybe you are hiding them from me.
('57', 62, 12, 26, 112156) A virtuous and non violent brahmachari who appreciates virtue instead of seeing the faults of others, admires their goodness while magnifying his own smallest short comings.
('57', 62, 12, 27, 112330) Tulsidas, Surdas, Tukaram saw their own faults and described them.
('57', 62, 12, 28, 112397) Besides, whatever Premabehn is, she is your teacher.
('57', 62, 12, 29, 112450) How strange it is that you could not see any virtue in her!
('57', 62, 12, 30, 112510) I observe many good qualities in her.
('57', 62, 12, 31, 112548) I have not told you that in one of her letters to me Premabehn had actually praised you.
('57', 62, 12, 32, 112637) Look, many people know about your idle nature

('57', 64, 3, 5, 114166) If what you say is true, you should take a deputation to Narandas.
('57', 64, 3, 6, 114233) You may take three minutes of his time in telling him what you wish and leave him two minutes to reply to you.
('57', 64, 3, 7, 114344) After that 2 you may write to me if I am alive then, lying enfeebled in bed.
('57', 64, 3, 8, 114421) And if I pass away into the final sleep, dance with joy and take a pledge that you will complete my work.
('57', 64, 3, 9, 114527) What great fun and joy that work will be!

('57', 64, 7, 14, 114757) JANAKIMAIYA, It is because women like you fear that they would starve to death if they had to live on the diet of ‘C’ class prisoners, that I have decided to embrace the way of living without eating.
('57', 64, 7, 15, 114957) You will see from tomorrow how I do that.
('57', 64, 7, 16, 114999) Everybody in the world eats and still dies.
('57', 64, 7, 17, 115043) Let us see how long you live eating the food of ‘A’ class prisoners.
('57', 64, 7, 18, 115112) Is it not a great art to survive an indefinite fast?
('57', 64, 7, 19, 115165) There is one condition, of course, for this to be made possible.
('57', 64, 7, 20, 115230) All women will have to come out of their homes as dedicated workers and eradicate the practice of untouchability, and so prove their claim to be incarnations of God’s powers.
('57', 64, 7, 21, 115405) Do that, and go on eating the food of ‘A’ class prisoners all your life.
('57', 64, 7, 22, 115478) If, however, you do not get ‘A’ class food on some occasion, you should be satisfied with ‘C’ class food.
('57', 64, 7, 23, 115584) Suppose, however, that the efforts of the women workers bear no fruit.
('57', 64, 7, 24, 115655) In that case, let this earthly frame perish right now.
('57', 64, 7, 25, 115710) Even then, I shall live for ever.
('57', 64, 7, 26, 115744) As long as even one woman carries on my mission, can anybody say that I am dead?

('57', 65, 1, 4, 116162) You must not, therefore, fall into panic.
('57', 65, 1, 5, 116204) Act in a manner which will do honour to yourself and to the cause.
('57', 65, 1, 6, 116271) Surrender yourself and all that you possess to God, and be happy and ever remain so.

('57', 65, 4, 13, 116655) KRITAYUGI 1 VINOBA, We need not envy you for living in the Kritayuga, for we, too, have with us the Kritayugi Sardar and, therefore, rise at least a few inches higher than you.
('57', 65, 4, 14, 116832) Do you know that the Sardar keeps walking for most of the time?
('57', 65, 4, 15, 116896) He would, if he could, even eat walking and spin walking.
('57', 65, 4, 16, 116954) Even though an old man, he tries to learn the Gita by heart while walking.

('57', 65, 4, 20, 117277) When a poor man like me had been pining for a letter from you, you did not write at all; and now when I am getting ready to lie down on my death bed, you write to say, “Now that I have started writing I will write regularly.” But maybe I am destined to survive this ordeal, since the vows of Kritayugis are not known to remain unfulfilled.
('57', 65, 4, 21, 117617) If I do leave this bed I will expect to hear regularly from you.
('57', 65, 4, 22, 117682) Through this bit of jesting, I have diverted my mind for a while from the letters I have been writing on serious matters and also

('57', 66, 4, 11, 118466) Moreover, Krishna had spiritual knowlede.
('57', 66, 4, 12, 118508) My knowledge is limited; and what a great number of Arjunas who ask me questions!
('57', 66, 4, 13, 118590) Try and count them.

('57', 69, 8, 10, 122054) PANDITJI,
('57', 69, 9, 11, 122064) Rambhau’s letter was both very good and very disappointing.
('57', 69, 9, 12, 122124) I have replied 2 to him.
('57', 69, 9, 13, 122149) But I will not give up hope for such an intelligent boy.
('57', 69, 10, 14, 122206) Kaka had told me Sundarbehn’s story when I left for England.
('57', 69, 10, 15, 122267) From that I had concluded that Sundarbehn had never had marital relations.
('57', 69, 10, 16, 122342) Her husband despised her from the beginning as he did not consider her beautiful, that is, fair skinned.
('57', 69, 10, 17, 122447) Now there is no moral reason to look upon a woman, whom her husband never accepted as wife, as a married woman.
('57', 69, 10, 18, 122559) In such cases, when the legal position has no moral basis, we should ignore law and uphold morality.
('57', 69, 10, 19, 122660) It would have been excellent if Sundarbehn could have remained unmarried; 1
('57', 69, 11, 20, 122736) but when she was unable to do that, the only moral course open to her was to find a suitable husband.
('57', 69, 11, 21, 122838) In doing this she ran the risk of being convicted but she accepted it.
('57', 69, 11, 22, 122909) I see no religious objection against such a marriage.
('57', 69, 11, 23, 122963) All laws regarding marriage have their origin in custom.They should be weighed in the scales of self control for examining their validity.
('57', 69, 11, 24, 123102) A course which on the whole promotes self control sho uld be preferred even if it is opposed to custom.
('57', 69, 12, 25, 123206) As regards the Ashram women, if you ask me specific questions I will explain my views further.

('57', 70, 6, 10, 123980) Your duty is to take sufficient rest and build up a strong body.
('57', 70, 6, 11, 124045) I need not say anything more about this.
('57', 70, 6, 12, 124086) Those who advised that girls, when they are ill, should immediately be married off are ignorant men.
('57', 70, 6, 13, 124187) The number of married women who remain ill is far greater in proportion to that of sickly maidens everywhere.
('57', 70, 6, 14, 124297) You are also right in contrasting people’s attitude towards girls with their attitude towards boys who fall ill.
('57', 70, 6, 15, 124410) However, you should take the implied charge against girls in the right sense and take care never to fall ill.
('57', 70, 6, 16, 124520) Some general knowledge about health, such as I have tried to give in my booklet, is necessary for preventing illness.
('57', 70, 6, 17, 124638) The bodies of unmarried girls should be as strong as steel, and so should be the bodies of unmarried boys.
('57', 70, 6, 18, 124745) But we find both sickly, and they are generally more so after marriage.
('57', 70, 6, 19, 124817) Look at Umiya, Rukhi, and Hari ichchha.
('57', 70, 6, 20, 124857) It did seem for a while that marriage had done Rukhi good but before long she was ill again.
('57', 70, 6, 21, 124950) From this, however, the girls should not rush to the conclusion that all who marry lose their health after marriage.
('57', 70, 6, 22, 125067) It is true, however, that unmarried girls who burn with passion and desire will find their deliverance only in marriage, since their passion is secretly eating them.
('57', 70, 6, 23, 125233) But this also means that such a girl feels before marriage as a married woman does and that she is, therefore, immoral.
('57', 70, 6, 24, 125353) Any person, whether a woman or a man, who yields to passion even though only inwardly, is immoral.

('57', 72, 3, 5, 126715) One who is determined to die can always end her life by biting off her tongue, by pressing the hands tightly against her throat and, if she has been bound, by breaking her bones trying to loosen herself.
('57', 72, 3, 6, 126919) And a very holy woman can end her life even by a sheer act of will.
('57', 72, 3, 7, 126987) This will, no doubt, be suicide but in certain circumstances suicide becomes one’s dharma.
('57', 72, 3, 8, 127078) When a wicked man tries to rape a woman, suicide becomes necessary if there is no other way of saving her honour.
('57', 72, 4, 9, 127192) I expect that you will stick to the post of Secretary, for you are truthful and steadfast.
('57', 72, 5, 10, 127283) The students will cease quarrelling among themselves not out of false shame in my presence, but because they will realize their error and feel ashamed of it.

('57', 73, 7, 11, 128286) GANGABEHN,
('57', 73, 8, 12, 128297) Nowadays you have been writing fairly regularly.
('57', 73, 8, 13, 128346) Do not at all be alarmed or upset by the yajna I have in mind.
('57', 73, 8, 14, 128409) I am going to have you all undertake similar sacrifices.
('57', 73, 8, 15, 128466) I will leave this body—if I have to—with the faith that you will be able to do it.
('57', 73, 8, 16, 128549) This is the only way to atone for the sins accumulated through generations.
('57', 73, 8, 17, 128625) Such a vow is not to be imitated.
('57', 73, 8, 18, 128659) It can be fulfilled only if there is a spontaneous urge.
('57', 73, 8, 19, 128716) If the urge is felt while the mind is not yet pure, the fast is likely to be demoniacal.
('57', 73, 8, 20, 128805) Hence such a yajna should beundertaken only if there has been a prior cleansing of the heart.
('57', 73, 8, 21, 128899) The Ashram has come into existence to help people attain such purity.
('57', 73, 8, 22, 128969) But you say that one hears much criticism of the Ashram.
('57', 73, 8, 23, 129026) You should bear with criticism.
('57', 73, 8, 24, 129058) The cause for it, if found to be just, should be examined and corrected.
('57', 73, 8, 25, 129131) We should be indifferent to what is not true.
('57', 73, 8, 26, 129177) People have a right to say what they feel.
('57', 73, 8, 27, 129220) And some may find fault simply out of spite.
('57', 73, 8, 28, 129265) Is not such criticism beneath consideration?
('57', 73, 8, 29, 129310) There is some truth in what we have been hearing about .
('57', 73, 8, 30, 129367) And whatever little there is deserves to be overlooked.
('57', 73, 8, 31, 129423) My little experience of .

('57', 74, 1, 2, 129629) enjoying herself there.
('57', 74, 1, 3, 129653) 1 needed a change of climate.
('57', 74, 1, 4, 129683) Since it could be easily had she availed herself of it.
('57', 74, 1, 5, 129739) 2’s relations [with her] are absolutely pure.
('57', 74, 1, 6, 129785) 3 has not been living there in an unbecoming way.
('57', 74, 1, 7, 129835) Her letter has given me the impression that she has continued to make such efforts as she can to purify her atman.
('57', 74, 1, 8, 129950) But now .
('57', 74, 1, 9, 129960) 4 has fallen.
('57', 74, 1, 10, 129974) I have therefore suggested to him to lead Ashram life.
('57', 74, 1, 11, 130029) Now about your loss of peace.
('57', 74, 1, 12, 130059) There are two reasons for it.
('57', 74, 1, 13, 130089) First, you are not satisfied with your own performance.
('57', 74, 1, 14, 130145) You aspire to do much more than you can.
('57', 74, 1, 15, 130186) Your desire would be commendable if it were within limits.
('57', 74, 1, 16, 130245) When it crosses the limits the result is grief.
('57', 74, 1, 17, 130293) A greater reason for the loss of your peace is your intolerance.
('57', 74, 1, 18, 130358) You are irked when others fail to work as much as you can or do not agree with you.
('57', 74, 1, 19, 130442) The remedy for it is simple.
('57', 74, 1, 20, 130471) You should rest content with whatever work you can do after applying your body and mind to it and continue to make such progress as you can.
('57', 74, 1, 21, 130612) You should realize that one who does scavenging has as much right to go to heaven as one who learns the Vedas.
('57', 74, 1, 22, 130723) But if a scholar of the Vedas is a mere reciter of the text or a hypocrite he will go to hell however learned he may be and a scavenger who daily cleans latrines in a spirit of service and dedicating his services unto God would certainly rise high although he may not know the word Brahman.
('57', 74, 1, 23, 131014) This contentment is one remedy.
('57', 74, 1, 24, 131046) The other is a liberal attitude.
('57', 74, 1, 25, 131079) We should not take it amiss if others do not work as much as we ourselves do or want them to do.
('57', 74, 1, 26, 131176) Only in this way can we maintain peace in the community in spite of living close to one another.
('57', 74, 1, 27, 131273) Read this letter over and over again and think over it with the help of Nath.
('57', 74, 1, 28, 131351) Please accommodate .
('57', 74, 1, 29, 131372) 5 behn.
('57', 74, 1, 30, 131380) What more can I wish than that you will shine out if it is God’s will?

('57', 75, 7, 9, 132012) You have attained a lofty height.
('57', 75, 7, 10, 132046) Rise higher still.
('57', 75, 7, 11, 132065) God will certainly give you the strength to do so.
('57', 75, 7, 12, 132116) I know I should write a long reply to your letter, but cannot spare so much time just now.
('57', 75, 7, 13, 132207) I will preserve your letter, however, and will write to you again if I have sufficient strength and get time to do so.
('57', 75, 7, 14, 132326) But please do not mind if I cannot write.
('57', 75, 7, 15, 132368) I hope none of you has got perturbed by this yajna of my fast.
('57', 75, 7, 16, 132431) God has inspired me to undertake it and may He carry it successfully to its end.
('57', 75, 7, 17, 132512) None knows how many such yajnas we shall have to perform in order to eradicate this evil of untouchability.
('57', 75, 7, 18, 132620) Get ready to perform such a yajna yourself.
('57', 75, 7, 19, 132664) Readiness means self purification.
('57', 75, 7, 20, 132699) Self purification necessarily includes efficiency in work.
('57', 75, 7, 21, 132758) It is true that fine yarn would be costly.
('57', 75, 7, 22, 132801) But we should have the ability to revive the manufacture of Dacca muslin.
('57', 75, 7, 23, 132875) While trying to do so, we shall incidentally make many small inventions.
('57', 75, 7, 24, 132948) In the past, the kings forced workers to spin such yarn and weave it.
('57', 75, 7, 25, 133018) Now, let us spin and weave it by way of yajna.
('57', 75, 7, 26, 133065) Then the question of its being costly will not arise at all and, moreover, the prestige of hand spinning also will increase.
('57', 75, 7, 27, 133190) God willing, I will explain this further in another letter.

('57', 76, 2, 5, 133430) She was the apple of his eye.
('57', 76, 2, 6, 133460) By banishing her to a forest, he banished himself, for his heart followed Sita.

('57', 76, 9, 21, 134367) Let him remain there.
('57', 76, 9, 22, 134389) You ought to dance on hearing about my yajna and have more faith in Ramanama.
('57', 76, 9, 23, 134467) Let us see what He does.
('57', 76, 9, 24, 134492) The fast is not mine but that of Rama; the responsibility is His, not mine.

('57', 78, 8, 16, 136499) I had looked forward to a firm opinion from you one way or the other.
('57', 78, 8, 17, 136569) But you have refused to criticize.
('57', 78, 8, 18, 136604) Though it can now only be during my fast I will yet prize your criticism, if your heart condemns my action.
('57', 78, 8, 19, 136712) I am not too proud to make an open confession of my blunder, whatever the cost of the confession, if I find myself in error.
('57', 78, 8, 20, 136837) If your heart approves of the action I want your blessing.
('57', 78, 8, 21, 136896) It will sustain me.

('57', 79, 2, 3, 137340) September 20, 1932
('57', 79, 3, 4, 137359) MY DEAREST FRIEND AND BROTHER, This is early morning of Tuesday just a little after 3 o’clock.
('57', 79, 3, 5, 137454) I have just finished a brief letter 1 to Gurudev.
('57', 79, 3, 6, 137504) You have been ever present before me during these days of anguish.
('57', 79, 3, 7, 137571) I have perhaps read your thoughts.
('57', 79, 3, 8, 137606) You know my regard for you.
('57', 79, 3, 9, 137634) Though we are as poles asunder, or seem to be, in mental outlook at so many points, our hearts are one.
('57', 79, 3, 10, 137738) Wherever therefore I have been able to agree with you, it has been a matter of pure joy.
('57', 79, 3, 11, 137827) Perhaps this step of mine has been for you the last straw.
('57', 79, 3, 12, 137886) Even so I want to have your laceration.
('57', 79, 3, 13, 137926) For I do not want you to cease to strive with me—I remained in banishment from my eldest brother for, I think, fourteen years.
('57', 79, 3, 14, 138053) Year after year he sent me curses by registered post.
('57', 79, 3, 15, 138107) I rejoiced in his curses.
('57', 79, 3, 16, 138133) His curses were so many sparks of love— I won him.
('57', 79, 3, 17, 138184) Six months before his death he saw that I was in the right.
('57', 79, 4, 18, 138244) One of the reasons for his wrath was this very question of untouch ability.
('57', 79, 4, 19, 138320) In our case, I do not know who is in error.
('57', 79, 4, 20, 138364) But I do know that you are as blood brother to me.
('57', 79, 4, 21, 138415) At this (may be) last crisis, you must not cease to strive with me.
('57', 79, 4, 22, 138483) Send me your curses or your blessings.
('57', 79, 4, 23, 138522) You may open my eyes, where others have failed, if you think I am in error.
('57', 79, 4, 24, 138598) You know me too well not to know that I have the God given capacity of owning mistakes, if the conviction comes to me.
('57', 79, 4, 25, 138717) Do write or wire to me.
('57', 79, 4, 26, 138741) I wrote to you a month ago inquiring about your health.
('57', 79, 4, 27, 138797) I never got a reply.
('57', 79, 4, 28, 138818) I wonder if you ever got my postcard.

('57', 80, 3, 4, 139075) MIRA, I got up at 2.30 today to write to Gurudev, then to Sastri and then to you.
('57', 80, 3, 5, 139157) I have your tearing letter.
('57', 80, 3, 6, 139185) At first I thought I would send it to the Governor.
('57', 80, 3, 7, 139237) But I rejected the thought as soon as it came.
('57', 80, 3, 8, 139284) You have chosen to enter the furnace.
('57', 80, 3, 9, 139322) You must remain in it.
('57', 80, 3, 10, 139345) My society is no easy job as you have seen all these years.
('57', 80, 3, 11, 139405) Drink then the poison to the last dregs.
('57', 80, 3, 12, 139446) As I wrote that first letter conveying my vow, I thought of you and of Ba.
('57', 80, 3, 13, 139521) And for a time I became giddy.
('57', 80, 3, 14, 139552) How would you two bear the thing?
('57', 80, 3, 15, 139586) But the voice within said, ‘If you will enter in, you must give up thought of all attachment.’ And the letter went.
('57', 80, 3, 16, 139702) No anguish will be too terrible to wash out the sin of untouchability.
('57', 80, 3, 17, 139773) You must therefore rejoice in this suffering and bear it bravely.
('57', 80, 3, 18, 139839) I know how difficult all this is to do.
('57', 80, 3, 19, 139879) Yet that is exactly what you have to try to do.
('57', 80, 3, 20, 139927) Just think and realize that there is no meaning in having the last look.
('57', 80, 3, 21, 140000) The spirit which you love is always with you.
('57', 80, 3, 22, 140046) The body through which you learnt to love the spirit is no longer necessary for sustaining that love.
('57', 80, 3, 23, 140148) It is well that it lasts whilst there is use for it.

('57', 80, 3, 25, 140266) And since we don’t know when it will outlast its use, we conclude that death through whatever cause means that there was no longer any use for it.

('57', 88, 8, 15, 147000) I deserve it all.
('57', 88, 8, 16, 147018) For I have the Hindu heart.
('57', 88, 8, 17, 147046) And have we not deserved the most terrible chastisement from God for ourtreatment of the untouchables?
('57', 88, 8, 18, 147149) And so He is trying me through and through before admitting me to the untouchable fold.
('57', 88, 8, 19, 147237) It has been an effort for the past 50 years.

('57', 88, 11, 23, 147383) September 20, 1932
('57', 88, 12, 24, 147402) DEAR FRIEND, I got your letter only yesterday whilst I was talking to the friends who came to see me.
('57', 88, 12, 25, 147504) I am now replying to it at earliest opportunity.
('57', 88, 12, 26, 147553) I thank you for your letter.
('57', 88, 12, 27, 147582) My position is this: My fast has reference only to separate electorate.
('57', 88, 12, 28, 147654) As soon as that is withdrawn the letter of the vow will be satisfied and I would be bound to call off the fast.
('57', 88, 12, 29, 147766) But a very heavy
('57', 88, 13, 30, 147783) 1 The addressee had invited Gandhiji to stay at the Servants of India Society’s Home at Poona during the fast.
('57', 88, 13, 31, 147894) 2 Vide “Letter to V.S. Srinivasa Sastri”, 20 9 1932.
('57', 89, 0, 1, 147947) 90 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 89, 1, 2, 147988) responsibility will then lie upon me of having a substitute that is infinitely superior to separate electorate.
('57', 89, 1, 3, 148100) If you will not resent my saying it, I would like to say that as I am a “touchable” by birth, I am an “untouchable” by choice.
('57', 89, 1, 4, 148227) And it was in this dual capacity that I wrote to Sir Samuel Hoare and then the Prime Minister.
('57', 89, 1, 5, 148322) It is that dual capacity that has compelled the fast.
('57', 89, 1, 6, 148376) Looking at the matter in this light I must say that I am not in love with the idea of statutory reservation.
('57', 89, 1, 7, 148485) Whilst it is not open to the same objection that separate electorate is, I have not a shadow of a doubt that it will prevent the natural growth of the suppressed classes and will remove the incentive to honourable amends from the suppressors.
('57', 89, 1, 8, 148728) What I am aiming at is a heart understanding between the two, the greatest opportunity of repentance and reparation on the part, of the suppressors.
('57', 89, 1, 9, 148877) I am certain that the moment is ripe for the change of heart among them.
('57', 89, 1, 10, 148950) I would therefore favour widest possible franchise for the suppressed and establish a convention between the two sections for securing proper election of representatives of the suppressed.
('57', 89, 1, 11, 149139) I have drafted a rough tentative scheme which I handed to the friends and which I explained fully yesterday to my son Devdas.
('57', 89, 1, 12, 149265) But to me this is not the largest but it is the least part of the reform I want.
('57', 89, 1, 13, 149346) Nothing will satisfy me till the last vestige of untouchability is gone.
('57', 89, 1, 14, 149419) I would therefore insist on a statutory declaration that all public places of worship, wells, schools, etc., should be open to the sup pressed precisely on the same terms as the suppressors.
('57', 89, 1, 15, 149610) This is roughly my idea.
('57', 89, 1, 16, 149635) If, however, the representatives of suppressed classes will not look at my idea, they are at liberty to have statutory reservation of seats.
('57', 89, 1, 17, 149776) I should not fast against it but you will not expect me to bless any such scheme.
('57', 89, 1, 18, 149858) Nor is my blessing essential to its acceptance by the Government.
('57', 89, 1, 19, 149924) If I get the opportunity, I should certainly try to create public opinion among the suppressed against statutory reservation.
('57', 89, 1, 20, 150050) If my position is not clear or satisfactory, I would be delighted to meet you and other friends including R.B. Raja and Dr. Ambedkar by appointment.
('57', 89, 1, 21, 150199) As you are aware this has become possible only now.

('57', 90, 2, 4, 150463) I have absolutely no notion as to how I am to be disposed of.
('57', 90, 2, 5, 150525) Therefore it is too early to say anything.
('57', 90, 2, 6, 150568) I certainly begin the fast here at 12. God alone knows where, when and how it will end.
('57', 90, 2, 7, 150656) All the same, pray accept my thanks for your sympathy and offer.

('57', 90, 5, 10, 150784) September 20, 1932
('57', 90, 7, 11, 150803) I got your letter yesterday.
('57', 90, 7, 12, 150832) On September 19. .
('57', 90, 7, 13, 150851) 2 There will be no harm at all if you rest a little from reading and writing just as you have been resting from spinning.
('57', 90, 7, 14, 150973) Only you cannot afford to stop your daily walks, as we found from our experience in Yeravda earlier.
('57', 90, 7, 15, 151074) Take long walks.
('57', 90, 7, 16, 151091) Be careful first about exercise, food and rest and then read and write as much as you can get time for.
('57', 90, 7, 17, 151195) I have three books by Sir.
('57', 90, 7, 18, 151222) James Jeans 3 which I am sending to you.
('57', 90, 7, 19, 151263) I liked them very much, though I find that there are people who disagree with his views.
('57', 90, 7, 20, 151352) I think I should read those books twice or thrice.
('57', 90, 7, 21, 151403) There are in them several things which are not clear to me.
('57', 90, 7, 22, 151463) However, I have become very much interested in the subject.
('57', 90, 7, 23, 151523) In a sense, you are not wrong in describing Galileo and others as rishis.
('57', 90, 7, 24, 151597) In a sense, because the rishis relied on intuition, and the word rishi denoted one who does that.
('57', 90, 7, 25, 151695) This is not to run down the work of Galileo and others.
('57', 90, 7, 26, 151751) Only it seems necesssary to keep in view the fact that the fields of the two types of men are different.
('57', 90, 7, 27, 151856) Try to find another term if you can.
('57', 90, 7, 28, 151893) You must have heard of my ordeal 4 and rejoiced at the news.
('57', 90, 7, 29, 151954) There can be no reason at all to be unhappy about it.
('57', 90, 7, 30, 152008) Fasting and

('57', 91, 1, 2, 152386) eating mean the same thing 1, just as birth and death mean the same thing.
('57', 91, 1, 3, 152461) In any case, if a co worker gives up his life for the sake of his dharma, it cannot be a cause for grief.
('57', 91, 1, 4, 152567) Such an opportunity comes very rarely to anybody, and when it comes it should be gladly welcomed.
('57', 91, 1, 5, 152665) Instead of being perturbed you should, therefore, be more vigilant and cultivate greater devotion to duty.
('57', 91, 1, 6, 152772) Leave the jail with improved health.
('57', 91, 1, 7, 152809) The filth of untouchability will be removed only after a great many sacrifices have been made.

('57', 91, 6, 15, 153081) I was indeed waiting for your letter.
('57', 91, 6, 16, 153119) I got it only last evening.
('57', 91, 6, 17, 153147) I would have liked a talk with you.
('57', 91, 6, 18, 153183) If, while the fast is in progress, I become convinced about its being contrary to dharma, I will immediately give it up without any false sense of shame.
('57', 91, 6, 19, 153337) I am ashamed of only one thing in the world—untruth—in thought, speech and action.
('57', 91, 6, 20, 153420) My step has not been dictated by reason; it was inspired by my inner voice.
('57', 91, 6, 21, 153496) My reason, however, told me: ‘Hundreds of persons like you will probably have to die in order to remove the blot of untouchability’.
('57', 91, 6, 22, 153629) Fasting is a very common practice in Hinduism.
('57', 91, 6, 23, 153676) I have always loved it.
('57', 91, 6, 24, 153700) My decision is the cry of my heart.
('57', 91, 6, 25, 153736) The Prime Minister’s decision was only the immediate cause.
('57', 91, 6, 26, 153796) It provided me with an opportunity to undertake the fast.
('57', 91, 6, 27, 153854) However, the aim of my fast is not merely to get the decision changed but to bring about the awakening and self purification which are bound to result from the effort to get the decision changed.
('57', 91, 6, 28, 154050) In other words this was an opportunity to strike at the very root of untouchability.

('57', 92, 1, 2, 154353) It is true that we cannot positively say that the step was right because it had brought about the desired result.
('57', 92, 1, 3, 154467) Everyone should judge for himself whether or not it is right.
('57', 92, 1, 4, 154529) And if one is unable to do so, one should accept the opinion of an elder.
('57', 92, 1, 5, 154603) To me the step seems not only right but even imperative.
('57', 92, 1, 6, 154660) Think over this and write to me again.

('57', 92, 8, 22, 155282) It seems that we remain where we were.
('57', 92, 8, 23, 155321) That is the position today.
('57', 92, 8, 24, 155349) What will happen tomorrow, God alone knows.
('57', 92, 8, 25, 155393) As things are, you can write daily if you wish.
('57', 92, 8, 26, 155441) The post will be despatched daily from here.
('57', 92, 8, 27, 155486) But do not expect many letters from me.

('57', 92, 8, 31, 155667) But nobody should be eager to come at any cost.
('57', 92, 8, 32, 155715) Tell this to Anasuyabehn, Shankerlal and Rama.
('57', 92, 8, 33, 155762) Inform Saraladevi too.
('57', 92, 8, 34, 155785) I would, however, advise that only those who cannot restrain their desire to come may come.
('57', 92, 8, 35, 155877) Everybody should devote himself or herself as much as possible to the service of the Antyajas.

('57', 93, 1, 6, 156369) When the fast commenced at noon, the following bhajan which Raihanabehn often sings was sung:
('57', 93, 2, 7, 156463) Awake, O traveller, it is morning now,
('57', 93, 3, 8, 156502) It is no longer night, that you still sleep;
('57', 93, 4, 9, 156547) He who sleeps will lose,
('57', 93, 5, 10, 156572) He who is awake will gain.
('57', 93, 5, 11, 156599) If you have got the complete bhajan there, Panditji should sing it to you all.

('57', 93, 8, 22, 157106) 159. INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS 1
('57', 93, 9, 23, 157136) September 20, 1932
('57', 93, 10, 24, 157155) For the first time in nine months journalists were permitted to see Mahatma Gandhi in Yeravda Jail this evening at 5.30 when they were treated to one of the most easily delivered and seriously thoughtful interviews to which it has ever been my fortune to listen.
('57', 93, 10, 25, 157418) No journalist could see Mahatma Gandhi today and discuss the position with him five hours after he had commenced “a fast unto death” without being immensely impressed .
('57', 93, 11, 26, 157587) When asked if he was hopeful about a happy ending to the affair, he said: I am an irrepressible optimist.
('57', 93, 11, 27, 157693) Unless God has forsaken me, I hope that it will not be a fast unto death.
('57', 93, 12, 28, 157767) Mahatma Gandhi said that he had many telegrams from people who had decided or wished to enter upon a fast in sympathy with him.
('57', 93, 13, 29, 157895) 1 This report of the interview first appeared in The Times of India, 21 9 1932.
('57', 94, 0, 1, 157975) VOL. 57 : 5 SEPTEMBER, 1932 15 NOVEMBER, 1932 95
('57', 94, 1, 2, 158024) I urge everybody not to fast in sympathy.
('57', 94, 1, 3, 158066) I have undertaken it at God’s call, and, therefore, unless there is a similar definite call to these people they have no business to fast.
('57', 94, 1, 4, 158205) For one day, for the sake of purification or identification with the cause, it is a good thing; but that is all.
('57', 94, 1, 5, 158318) Such a fast is both a privilege and a duty, and the privilegeaccrues only to those who have disciplined themselves for it.
('57', 94, 2, 6, 158441) The interview then turned to the question of the day, the representation of the Depressed Classes, or as Mahatma Gandhi calls them, the Suppressed Classes.
('57', 94, 3, 7, 158597) First of all he expressed surprise that the statement 1 given to the Government of Bombay had not been released.
('57', 94, 3, 8, 158710) That had been given five days ago.
('57', 94, 3, 9, 158745) Had he to redraft it today it would be rather different in the light of happenings since then, and he said at the end of the interview that his new statement was supplementary to the other, but not dependent on it.
('57', 94, 3, 10, 158960) He said: My cards are on the table, but, so far as the present instance is concerned, I could say nothing from behind prison bars.
('57', 94, 3, 11, 159091) Now that the restrictions are removed, I have answered the first call of the Press.
('57', 94, 3, 12, 159175) My fast is only against separate electorates, and not against statutory reservation of seats.
('57', 94, 3, 13, 159269) To say that I am damaging the cause by uncompromising opposition to statutory reservation of seats is only partly true.
('57', 94, 3, 14, 159389) Opposed I was, and am even now, but there was never put before me for any acceptance or rejection a scheme for statutory reservation of seats.
('57', 94, 3, 15, 159532) Therefore, there is no question of my having to decide upon that point.
('57', 94, 3, 16, 159604) When I developed my own idea about that point, I certainly expressed disappointment, and in my humble opinion, such statutory reservation, short of doing service, may do harm in the sense that it will stop natural evolution.
('57', 94, 3, 17, 159829) Statutory reservation is like a support to a man.
('57', 94, 3, 18, 159879) Relying on such support to any extent he weakens himself.
('57', 94, 3, 19, 159937) If people won’t laugh at me, I would gently put forward a claim, which I have always asserted, that I am a ‘touchable’ by birth but an untouchable by choice; and I have endeavoured to qualify myself to represent, not the upper ten even among the untouchables, because be it said to their shame there are castes and classes among them, but my ambition is to represent and identify myself with, as far as possible, the lowest strata of untouchables, namely, the ‘invisibles’ and the ‘unapp roachables’, whom I have always before my mind’s eye wherever I go; for they have indeed drunk deep of the poisoned cup.
('57', 94, 3, 20, 160546) I have met

('57', 95, 0, 1, 160601) 96 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 95, 1, 2, 160642) them in Malabar and in Orissa, and am convinced that if they are ever to rise, it will not be by reservation of seats but will be by the strenuous work of Hindu reformers in their midst, and it is because I feel that this separation would have killed all prospect of reform that my whole soul has rebelled against it; and, let me make it plain, that the withdrawal of separate electorates will satisfy the letter of my vow but will never satisfy the spirit behind it, and in my capacity of being a self chosen untouchable, I am not going to rest content with a patched up pact between the ‘touchables’ and the untouchables.
('57', 95, 1, 3, 161266) What I want, what I am living for, and what I should delight in dying for, is the eradication of untouchability root and branch.
('57', 95, 1, 4, 161395) I want, therefore, a living pact whose life giving effect should be felt not in the distant tomorrow but today, and, therefore, that pact should be sealed by an all India demonstration of ‘touchables’ and untou chables meeting together, not by way of a theatrical show, but in real brotherly embrace.
('57', 95, 1, 5, 161696) It is in order to achieve this, the dream of my life for the past fifty years, that I have entered today the fiery gates.
('57', 95, 1, 6, 161818) The British Government’s decision was the last straw.
('57', 95, 1, 7, 161872) It was a decisive symptom, and with the unerring eye of the physician that I claim to be in such matters, I detected the symptom.
('57', 95, 1, 8, 162002) Therefore, for me the abolition of separate electorates would be but the beginning of the end, and I would warn all those leaders assembled at Bombay and others against coming to any hasty decision.
('57', 95, 1, 9, 162201) My life I count of no consequence.
('57', 95, 1, 10, 162236) One hundred lives given for this noble cause would, in my opinion, be poor penance done by Hindus for the atrocious wrongs they have heaped upon helpless men and women of their own faith.
('57', 95, 1, 11, 162424) I, therefore, would urge them not to swerve an inch from the path of strictest justice.
('57', 95, 1, 12, 162512) My fast I want to throw in the scales of justice, and if it wakes up caste Hindus from their slumber, and if they are roused to a sense of their duty, it will have served its purpose.
('57', 95, 1, 13, 162696) Whereas, if out of blind affection for me, they would somehow or other come to a rough and ready agreement so as to secure the abrogation and then go off to sleep, they will commit a grievous blunder and will have made my life a misery.
('57', 95, 1, 14, 162933) For, while the abrogation of separate electorates would result in my breaking the fast, it would be living death for me if the vital pact for which I am striving is not arrived at.
('57', 95, 1, 15, 163114) It would simply mean that, as soon as I called off the fast, I would have to give notice of another in order to achieve the spirit of the vow to the fullest extent.
('57', 96, 0, 1, 163279) VOL. 57 : 5 SEPTEMBER, 1932 15 NOVEMBER, 1932 97
('57', 96, 1, 2, 163328) This may look childish to the onlooker but not so to me.
('57', 96, 1, 3, 163385) If I had anything more to give, I would throw that in also to remove this curse, but I have nothing more than my life.
('57', 96, 1, 4, 163504) I believe that if untouchability is really rooted out, it will not only purge Hinduism of a terrible blot but its repercussions will be world wide.
('57', 96, 1, 5, 163652) My fight against untouchability is a fight against the impure in humanity, and, therefore, when I penned my letter 1 to Sir Samuel Hoare I did so in the full faith that the very best in human family will come to my assistance if I have embarked on this thing with a heart, so far as it is possible for a human being to achieve, free of impurity, free of all malice and all anger.
('57', 96, 1, 6, 164032) You will, therefore, see that my fast is based first of all in the cause of faith in the Hindu community, faith in human nature itself, and faith even in the official world.
('57', 96, 1, 7, 164206) In attacking untouchability I have gone to the very root of the matter, and, therefore, it is an issue of transcendental value, far surpassing swaraj in terms of political constitutions, and I would say that such a constitution would be a dead weight if it was not backed by a moral basis, in the shape of the present hope engendered in the breasts of the downtrodden millions that that weight is going to be lifted from their shoulders.
('57', 96, 1, 8, 164644) It is only because the English officials cannot possibly see this living side of the picture that in their ignorance and self satisfaction they dare to sit as judges upon questions that affect the fundamental being of millions of people, and here I mean both caste Hindus and untouchables, that is, the suppr essor and the suppressed; and it was in order to wake up even officialdom from its gross ignorance, if I may make use of such an expression without being guilty of offence, that I felt impelled by a voice from within to offer resistance with the whole of my being.
('57', 96, 2, 9, 165218) He stated that he had made definite suggestions to the deputation from the Emergency Committee whom he received yesterday and he presumed that these would have been communicated to the Press today in Bombay.
('57', 96, 3, 10, 165426) Referring to a possible photograph Mahatma Gandhi made a jocular remark concerning his funeral rites whereupon I asked him he had made any preparations for such rites when visited by his son Devdas yesterday if the very worst happeneed, and I received a dramatic reply.

('57', 97, 0, 1, 165744) 98 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 97, 1, 2, 165785) I have asked my son to say in my name at the Bombay Conference that he as his father’s son was prepared to forfeit his father’s life rather than see any injury being done to the Suppressed Classes in mad haste.
('57', 97, 2, 3, 165996) What did he really think about the possibilities of his fast lasting?
('57', 97, 2, 4, 166066) He replied: I am as anxious as anyone to live.

('57', 99, 4, 21, 170180) Sanskrit is like the river Ganga for our languages.

('57', 102, 6, 11, 174038) 171. INTERVIEW TO S. M. MATE, P. N. RAJBHOJ AND LIMAYE 1
('57', 102, 7, 12, 174095) September 21, 1932
('57', 102, 8, 13, 174114) If I had my way I would insist on temple entry and the like being included in any pact that may be concluded and I would invite all reformers and untouchables to do so.
('57', 102, 8, 14, 174283) I am aware that temple entry is a difficult thing to accomplish in the very limited time that my life can hold out against the fast, but all the parties to the pact should pledge themselves to realize this elementary right of human beings at the earliest opportunity.
('57', 102, 8, 15, 174551) At the same time I do not want this fast to be used for coercing orthodoxy.
('57', 102, 8, 16, 174627) The fast is certainly intended to sting even orthodoxy into thinking.
('57', 102, 8, 17, 174697) But if they cannot get on to this elementary truth about human rights we must have patience.
('57', 102, 8, 18, 174790) But temples and the like are the property not of orthodoxy but of all Hindus.
('57', 102, 8, 19, 174868) Therefore this idea of excluding a section of Hindus from the use of public utilities is itself a species of violence, and, therefore, the support of legislation has got to be invoked in order to protect this fundamenal right.
('57', 102, 8, 20, 175095) I recognize, however, that if the majority of the Hindus are against the exercise of this right by the so called untouchables, mere legislation will be wholly ineffective.
('57', 102, 8, 21, 175267) But my opinion is that the mind of the majority is for this reform if it comes stealthily.
('57', 102, 8, 22, 175358) Therefore, reformers should prepare the ground now cease 
('57', 102, 9, 23, 175416) 1 According to the source, what follows is the substance of Gandhiji’s talk.
('57', 103, 0, 1, 175493) 104 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 103, 1, 2, 175535) lessly and vigilantly to convert the passive attitude towards the reform into active approval thereof.
('57', 103, 1, 3, 175638) This rising tide of opinion in favour of the reform will convince orthodoxy that it is inevitable.
('57', 103, 1, 4, 175737) The work, therefore, must be free of all violence, even mental.
('57', 103, 1, 5, 175801) Legislation in a free State always represents the will of the majority.
('57', 103, 1, 6, 175873) All legislation in advance of general opinion argues bank ruptcy of missionary effort.
('57', 103, 1, 7, 175960) My reliance, therefore, always has been on missionary enterprise.
('57', 103, 1, 8, 176026) Therefore, for the pact to be a living pact, it is absolutely necessary that it should be a condition precedent to an acceptance of the political part of it, that the caste Hindus party to the pact will not only endorse it but actively move in the matter.
('57', 103, 1, 9, 176282) My own opinion is quite clear.
('57', 103, 1, 10, 176313) I would accept any pact that has not a tinge of separate electorate about it.
('57', 103, 1, 11, 176391) I would, with the utmost reluctance, tolerate reservation of seats under a joint electorate scheme.
('57', 103, 1, 12, 176491) But I should insist upon what is to me the vital part of the pact, the social and religious reform.
('57', 103, 1, 13, 176591) And, therefore, whilst if a settlement is arrived at on the joint electorate scheme and separate electorate is withdrawn by the British Government, I will break my fast, I will immediately give notice to the millions of Hindus, who have flocked round me at the innumerable meetings from one end of India to the other, that if within, say, six months the social reform is not demonstrably achieved, the fast will be taken up again.
('57', 103, 1, 14, 177022) For, if I do not do so I would be guilty of betraying God in whose name I have taken this great fast and the interest of untouchables for whose sake it has been taken.
('57', 103, 1, 15, 177190) I have not yet approved of the Nasik Satyagraha about Kalaram temple for the simple reason that I have smelt a trace of violence in that satyagraha, and satyagraha is inconsistent with the slightest violence.
('57', 103, 1, 16, 177399) I understand also that with reference to temples like Parvati temple there is a difficulty about the trust.
('57', 103, 1, 17, 177507) The trust deed itself lays an obligation on the trustees to prohibit the entry of untouchables into the temple.
('57', 103, 1, 18, 177619) Where such a disability exists, I would be able to understand the powerlessness of the trustees.
('57', 103, 1, 19, 177716) Any satyagraha in reference to such temples would be pure violence.
('57', 103, 1, 20, 177784) I would hold that at this time of the day such a condition in any trust should be considered against public morals and, therefore, of no effect.
('57', 103, 1, 21, 177929) And if such a judgment can be obtained, clearly legislation must step in and rendersuch a clause invalid.
('57', 103, 1, 22, 178035) Rajbhoj fears that if Dr. Ambedkar accepts a reasonable compromise, Government may call another leader into being who will declare his opposition, and if that fear is realized there would be eternal opposition by the Government to any

('57', 104, 1, 2, 178320) pact, and, therefore, my fast must end in my death, and that, therefore, I should give up the fast.
('57', 104, 1, 3, 178420) Granting that Mr. Rajbhoj’s fear is justified I cannot undo a pledge taken with God as witness.
('57', 104, 1, 4, 178516) We are not able to forecast all future events.
('57', 104, 1, 5, 178563) We can, therefore, only control our acts, and it is well with us and our cause if we unflinchingly act on the square in spite of the heaviest odds.
('57', 104, 1, 6, 178711) Our final trust must rest upon the assured victory of truth.
('57', 104, 1, 7, 178772) Such correct action has without exception confounded the opponents and brought out the intended result, granting of course that the cause is as just as the action is correct.
('57', 104, 1, 8, 178947) I must not, therefore, on any account, suspend the fast unless its terms are fulfilled.

('57', 108, 16, 27, 184984) Though weakness must naturally creep on from day to day, compared to my previous fasts, I am taking this much more easily.
('57', 108, 16, 28, 185107) I find myself also at perfect peace and hitherto I have found no difficulty in carrying on the prolonged and sustained conversations
('57', 108, 17, 29, 185240) 1 The statement was “in response to an invitation to reply to one or two questions” and was taken down by Mahadev Desai.

('57', 109, 1, 4, 185543) I know however that I cannot carry on like this much longer.
('57', 109, 1, 5, 185604) I am quite optimistic with regard to this afternoon’s conference.
('57', 109, 1, 6, 185670) 1 My optimism may be perfectly stupid; for, if you were to ask me to give reasons, I have none, save that I have much faith in this fast as a God ordained thing and I have an equal faith in the cause.
('57', 109, 2, 7, 185871) My message to British and American people is that they must not mistake this for a political move.
('57', 109, 2, 8, 185970) It is a deep spiritual effort, a result of fifty years’ constant application to an ideal.
('57', 109, 2, 9, 186060) It is a penace, and, seeing that the ideal is nothing less than the deliverance of serveral million human beings from horrible religious serfdom, success cannot but have its repercussions on the whole of humanity.
('57', 109, 2, 10, 186274) It is because, rightly or wrongly, I believe the British decision imposing separate electorates threatens to put huge obstacle in the way of reform, which has been for the past ten years moving on in geometrical progression, that I have staked my life to resist it.
('57', 109, 2, 11, 186540) After threed days, my conviction is stronger that the step I have taken is absolutely correct and, if my presentation is true, this cause demands the mobilization of world opinion, so as to compel right conduct by the British Government.

('57', 111, 18, 21, 188781) As one who had shared with my late husband joy of working for and obtaining sacred unity of Egyptian Christians, Mahomedans, Copts and also other communities of whatever religion or denomination, may I express my sincere hope that India’s people inspired by Gandhi’s sublime act of self abrogation would unite in one great mass of brothers and patriots to save India’s liberation and save life of her great son whose life and work are patrimony of East and humanity at large.” 2 This was scribbled by Gandhiji at the top of a letter Mahadev Desai wrote to Mirabehn informing her about Gandhiji’s condition on the fifth day, of his fast.

('57', 112, 8, 12, 189771) DEAR MATHURADAS,
('57', 112, 9, 13, 189788) Though this is the fifth day of Bapu’s fast, he is quite energetic.
('57', 112, 9, 14, 189856) People like you and me would lose courage and give ourselves upto distress and dejection.
('57', 112, 9, 15, 189946) But Bapu’s indomitable faith is sustaining him.
('57', 112, 9, 16, 189994) God willing, everything will be over in a couple of days.
('57', 112, 9, 17, 190052) I am writing this letter on behalf of Bapu.
('57', 112, 9, 18, 190096) Hence instructions from the Inspector General to the authorities there to permit you to send a reply are also being sent along with it.

('57', 113, 1, 2, 191110) 187. INTERVIEW TO “THE TIMES OF INDIA”
('57', 113, 2, 3, 191149) September 24, 1932 Yes, I shall certainly fast again, should the necessity arise as I firmly believe that by this means one can convince the world of the sincerity of one’s view.
('57', 113, 3, 4, 191328) So said Mr. Gandhi to me in answer to one of my questions when I had the pleasure of having a long talk with him on the fifth day of his fast in Yeravda Jail.
('57', 113, 4, 5, 191487) I certainly did not expect when I set off from Poona station before seven in the morning that I would be able to see Mr. Gandhi so early.
('57', 113, 4, 6, 191625) What a pleasant surprise it was when I received word from the jail authorities that the time was opportune.
('57', 113, 4, 7, 191733) The great doors of Yeravda swung open, and I walked in.
('57', 113, 5, 8, 191789) My escort led me through a courtyard, then through another little door which led on to a small compound roughly 150 feet by 40 feet wide, on one side of which were a few cells intended for State prisoners, but they all appeared to be unocccupied.
('57', 113, 5, 9, 192036) At one end of the compound under the shade of a small mango tree was Mr. Gandhi lying on a cot covered with a prison blanket.
('57', 113, 6, 10, 192162) At his head was one of his faithful followers fanning him gently with a towel to keep off pestering flies.
('57', 113, 6, 11, 192269) Seated round him were Mr. Vallabhbhai Patel, Mrs. Gandhi, Mr. Mahadev Desai.
('57', 113, 6, 12, 192346) Introductions over, Mr. Gandhi soon fell to asking me what particular question I wanted to ask him.
('57', 113, 6, 13, 192446) But to see him looking so frail and weak and obviously ill—well, it seemed too much to start interviewing.
('57', 113, 7, 14, 192553) But his eyes flashed when he answered my question.
('57', 113, 7, 15, 192604) He then appeared to recede into his shell, only raising himself up on his elbows to take a drink of water from a bottle at his side.
('57', 113, 8, 16, 192737) He said: Very nasty, you know.
('57', 113, 8, 17, 192768) At times I try to change it by putting in a pinch of salt, but through it all my stomach is in an intense state of nausea.
('57', 113, 9, 18, 192891) Mr. Gandhi said that he would be delighted to go to London for the third Conference if his demands would be met, but not otherwise.
('57', 113, 10, 19, 193023) Then I asked him what I thought was a pertinent question and certainly did not expect an answer, but the ailing man had always a ready reply, and here is what he said: You ask, ‘Suppose all Indian leaders decided to practise this method of gaining their own ends, no matter for what cause?’ Well, I admit, there is a lot of risk in the method.
('57', 113, 10, 20, 193367) But it is like every great power in the world.
('57', 113, 10, 21, 193414) Misuse creates mischief.
('57', 113, 10, 22, 193439) Let us take the
('57', 114, 0, 1, 193455) VOL. 57 : 5 SEPTEMBER, 1932 15 NOVEMBER, 1932 115
('57', 114, 1, 2, 193505) illustration of a well known poison—arsenic.
('57', 114, 1, 3, 193550) It is a most powerful medicinal drug, but should not on that account be blotted out of exist ence, although we know that many people make harmful use of it.
('57', 114, 1, 4, 193707) Therefore, if a thing is inherently good, and it is used at the proper time and in the proper measure, it is calculated to do universal good on an extensive scale almost bordering on the miraculous.
('57', 114, 1, 5, 193906) One must make use of that power irrespective of the fact that others are likely to make harmful use of it.
('57', 114, 2, 6, 194013) Further, in case of fasting of this nature, there is not much scope for it to thrive or become popular for the simple reason that it is such an agonizing process that ordinary human nature shudders at the very thought of having to undergo it.
('57', 114, 3, 7, 194256) So you see, the danger is not so very great.
('57', 114, 3, 8, 194301) It is only by training the body that one can do without food for any length of time.
('57', 114, 3, 9, 194386) The undisciplined and weak would soon give up the idea.
('57', 114, 4, 10, 194442) At the end of this long statement Mr. Gandhi leant back, weak from exhaustion, onto his bed.
('57', 114, 4, 11, 194535) Immediately two of the jail doctor were at his side to render what help they could.
('57', 114, 4, 12, 194619) But Mr. Gandhi seemed to derive most comfort from Mrs. Gandhi, who although obviously suffering, seemed delighted to have the opportunity of altering his pillow, rubbing his forehead with olive oil, and quietly talking to him.
('57', 114, 5, 13, 194846) Meanwhile, Mr. Gandhi’s disciples were receiving other political visitors and soon the compound was a scene of bustle and excitement.
('57', 114, 6, 14, 194980) From his secretary I gathered that Mr. Gandhi rose duirng his fast every morning at four; prayers were said from then to about half past four or five; then a shave by his prison barber, his breakfast—a drink of water—and, perhaps, an hour’s sleep.
('57', 114, 6, 15, 195228) But this was constantly interrupted by special cables from all over the world.

('57', 117, 8, 15, 199024) This right shall have statutory recognition at the first opportunity and shall be one of the earliest acts of the Swaraj Parliament, if it shall not have received such recognition before that time.
('57', 117, 8, 16, 199222) It is further agreed that it shall be the duty of all Hindu leaders to secure, by every legitimate and peaceful means, an early removal of all social disabilities now imposed by custom upon the so called untouchable classes including the bar in respect of admission to temples.

('57', 118, 1, 8, 201116) class returned by the electorate, fresh elections of members of the general electorate shall take place for the particular provincial legislature or the central legislature as he case may be, with reservation of seat for the e.u.c.
('57', 118, 1, 9, 201348) guaranteed by statute for the next ten years on the basis of population, provided however that no referendum will be necessary where representatives of that class have been elected in accordance with the proportion of their population.

('57', 118, 1, 12, 201986) I hereby solemnly pledge myself to serve by strictly non violent and truthful means the due fulfilment by the so called caste Hindus of the pact entered into between them and the Hindus hitherto known as ‘untouchables’ and to that end shall be prepared to undergo all the

('57', 119, 4, 5, 202842) September 25, 1932
('57', 119, 5, 6, 202861) Every day of the fast seems to me conclusive evidence of the hand of God in it.
('57', 119, 5, 7, 202941) Even I with my boundless faith in God and His mercy was not prepared for this great wave of awakening against untouchability.
('57', 119, 5, 8, 203067) That some of the great temples should have spontaneously admitted the untouchables without restriction is to me a modern miracle.
('57', 119, 5, 9, 203197) They have only now admitted God.
('57', 119, 5, 10, 203230) Hitherto, the images which the custodians, falsely and in their pride, thought had God within were Godless.
('57', 119, 5, 11, 203338) The Cabinet decision was to me a timely warning from God that I was asleep when He was knocking at the door and waking me up.
('57', 119, 5, 12, 203464) The settlement 2 arrived at is to me but the beginning of the work of purification.
('57', 119, 5, 13, 203548) The agony of the soul is not going to end until every trace of untouchability is gone.
('57', 119, 5, 14, 203635) I do not want the British Cabinet to come to any hasty decision.
('57', 119, 5, 15, 203700) I do not want them for saving my life or for appearing to be right with the world to accept it in a niggardly spirit.
('57', 119, 5, 16, 203818) If they have not realized the true inwardness of the Agreement, they must summarily reject it, but if they have, they will not alter one word or comma of it, but they will implement every condition that is implied in the great settlement which the so called untouchables and the so called touchables have arrived at with all their heart and with God as their witness.
('57', 119, 5, 17, 204186) I hope that they and the world will realize that this settlement is, if I may say so in all humility, far superior to the Cabinet decision.
('57', 119, 5, 18, 204326) There is no pride about it.
('57', 119, 5, 19, 204354) The Cabinet composed of foreigners, knowing nothing first hand of the Indian conditions or what untouchability could mean, were labouring under a heavy handicap,

('57', 120, 1, 3, 205000) I am not saying this from my penitential bed in any carping spirit or spirit of irritation.
('57', 120, 1, 4, 205092) I claim to be a true friend of the British nation and also of the Cabinet, and I would be untrue to them, to myself and to my call, if at this moment I suppressed my relevant opinion.
('57', 120, 1, 5, 205276) I would like finally to assure Britain that so long as life lasts in me, I shall undergo as many fasts as are necessary in order to purify Hinduism of this unbearable taint.
('57', 120, 1, 6, 205450) Thank God there is not only one man in this movement but, I believe, there are several thousands who will lay down their life in order to achieve this reform in its fulness.

('57', 120, 3, 9, 205671) September 25, 1932 If the Premier accepts the settlement in toto I would be bound to break the fast.
('57', 120, 3, 10, 205772) The settlement, as far as the political part of it is concerned, merely removes the tremendous obstacle that the Cabinet’s decision put in the way of reform.
('57', 120, 3, 11, 205930) The real part of the settlement is now to come and whilst, if the Premier accepts in toto the settlement cabled to him, my fast must end, the real struggle for me only begins.
('57', 120, 3, 12, 206106) As a matter of fact if the Cabinet had published the correspondence in time I would have been in honour bound to insist on the due fulfilment of the duty that lies on the so called caste Hindus.
('57', 120, 3, 13, 206301) I should be guilty of betrayal of trust if I did not ensure that, but as they had no notice worth the name of my intention to fast, I could not expect them all of a sudden to revolutionize Hindu thought.
('57', 120, 3, 14, 206505) They must, therefore, have breathing time for work, and so I have told fellow workers that if this fast is broken in virtue of the Cabinet’s satisfactory answer it would be put in suspension, but sure as fate, it will be taken up again if the part to be performed by the caste Hindus is not well played during the coming months.
('57', 120, 3, 15, 206834) The tremendous awakening that has taken place in the country during the five days fills me with hope that orthodoxy will surpass itself and rid Hinduism of the canker of untouchability which is eating into its vitals.
('57', 120, 3, 16, 207052) I suppose the future plan is in the hands of Government.

('57', 121, 2, 3, 207197) September 25, 1932 It has been a matter of increasing joy, day by day, to find great ancient temples being opened to the so called “untouchables” and thus becoming purified.
('57', 121, 2, 4, 207371) This one fact, among many others, has been a great sustaining force during these days of agony of body, mind and soul.
('57', 121, 2, 5, 207490) But the joy about the opening of the temples has not been unmixed with sorrow, in that the South, where my work on a larger scale amongst “untouchables” began, though in South Africa, has not been as prompt and generous in throwing open the gates of the temples to outcastes.
('57', 121, 2, 6, 207766) Speaking as a Hindu, striving to find and to live up to the very essence of it, I say, without the slightest hesitation, that God will be installed in the idols of the temples only if they are thrown open unreservedly to outcastes.
('57', 121, 2, 7, 207998) Today, with human outcastes, God Himself is an outcaste.

('57', 122, 6, 8, 209628) 201. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
('57', 122, 7, 9, 209656) September 26, 1932
('57', 122, 8, 10, 209675) The fast undertaken in the name of the God was broken in the presence of Gurudev, and Parachure Shastri, the leper prisoner and a learned pandit, seated opposite each other, and in the company of loving and loved ones who had gathered round me.
('57', 122, 8, 11, 209920) The breaking was preceded by the Poet singing one of his Bengali hymns, then mantras from the Upanishads by Parachure Shastri, and then my favourite hymn “Vaishnava Jana” .
('57', 122, 8, 12, 210093) The hand of God has been visible in the glorious manifestation throughout the length and breadth of India during the past seven days.
('57', 122, 8, 13, 210227) The cables received from many parts of the world blessing the fast have sustained me through the agony of body and soul that I passed through during the seven days, but the cause was worth going through that agony.
('57', 122, 8, 14, 210442) The sacrificial fire, once lit, shall not be put out as long as there is the slightest trace of untouchability still left in Hinduism.
('57', 122, 8, 15, 210577) If it is God’s will that it does not end with my life, I have the confidence that there are several thousands of earnest reformers who will lay down their lives in order to purify Hinduism of this awful curse.
('57', 122, 8, 16, 210787) The settlement arrived at is, so far as I can see, a generous gesture on all sides.
('57', 122, 8, 17, 210871) It is a meeting of hearts, and my Hindu gratitude is due to Dr. Ambedkar, Rao Bahadur Srinivasan and their party on the one hand and Rao Bahadur M. C. Raja on the other.
('57', 122, 8, 18, 211041) They could have taken up an uncompromising and defiant attitude by way of punishment to the so called caste Hindus for the sins of generations.
('57', 122, 8, 19, 211185) If they had done so, I at least could not have resented their attitude and my death would have been but a triffling price exacted for the
('57', 123, 0, 1, 211323) 124 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 123, 1, 2, 211365) tortures that the outcastes of Hinduism have been going through for unknown generations.
('57', 123, 1, 3, 211454) But they chose a nobler path and have thus shown that they have followed the precept of forgiveness enjoined by all religi ons.
('57', 123, 1, 4, 211582) Let me hope that the caste Hindus will prove themselves worthy of this forgiveness and carry out to the letter and spirit every clause of the settlement with all its implications.
('57', 123, 1, 5, 211762) The settlement is but the beginning of the end.
('57', 123, 1, 6, 211810) The political part of it, very important though it no doubt is, occupies but a small space in the vast field of reform that has to be tackled by caste Hindus during the coming days, namely, the complete removal of social and religious disabilities under which a large part of the Hindu population has been groaning.
('57', 123, 1, 7, 212126) I should be guilty of a breach of trust if I did not warn fellow reformers and caste Hindus in general that the breaking of the fast carried with it a sure promise of a resumption of it if this reform is not relentlessly pursued and achieved within a measurable period.
('57', 123, 1, 8, 212396) I had thought of laying down a period, but I feel that I may not do so without a definite call from within.
('57', 123, 1, 9, 212504) The message of freedom shall penetrate every untouchable home and that can only happen if reformers will cover every village.
('57', 123, 1, 10, 212630) Yet, in the wave of enthusiasm and in an inordinate desire to spare me a repetition of the agony, there should be no coercion.
('57', 123, 1, 11, 212757) We must, by patient toil and self suffering, convert the ignorant and the supersti tious but never seek to compel them by force.
('57', 123, 1, 12, 212886) I wish, too, that the almost ideal solution that has been arrived at may be followed by the other communities, and that we might see the dawn of a new era of mutual trust, mutual give and take, and a recognition of the fundamental unity of all communities.
('57', 123, 1, 13, 213143) I would here single out the Hindu Muslim Sikh question.
('57', 123, 1, 14, 213199) I am the same to the Mussalman today that I was in 1920 22. I should be just as prepared to lay down my life as I was in Delhi 1 to achieve organic unity andpermanent peace between them.
('57', 123, 1, 15, 213386) I hope and pray that there will be, as a result of this upheaval, a spontaneous move in this direction and then, surely, the other communities can no longer stand out.
('57', 123, 1, 16, 213554) In conclusion, I would like to thank the Government and the Jail staff and the medical men appointed by the Government to look after me.
('57', 123, 1, 17, 213691) Extreme care and attention was bestowed upon me.
('57', 123, 1, 18, 213740) Nothing was left undone.

('57', 124, 1, 4, 213972) I thank the British Cabinet for hastening the decision on settlement.
('57', 124, 1, 5, 214042) The terms of the decision sent to me I have not approached without misgivings.
('57', 124, 1, 6, 214121) It accepts, I suppose very naturally, only that part of the Agreement that refers to the British Cabinet’s communal decision.
('57', 124, 1, 7, 214247) I expect that they had a constitutional difficulty in now announcing their acceptance of the whole Agreement.
('57', 124, 1, 8, 214357) But I would like to assure my Harijan friends, as I would like hencefoth to name them, that so far as I am concerned, I am wedded to the whole of that Agreement, and that they may hold my life as hostage for its due fulfilment, unless we ourselves arrive at any other and better settlement of our own free will.

('57', 126, 19, 25, 217536) DEAR COL.
('57', 126, 20, 26, 217546) The substance of what I said to you yesterday before breaking my fast was this.
('57', 126, 20, 27, 217626) I was breaking the fast not without misgivings in that
('57', 126, 21, 28, 217681) 1 In reply to a similar telegram from Purushottamdas, the Dewan of Travancore said: “His Highness’s Government is surprised at statement that Maharaja’s approval necessary to throwing open Guruvayur temple.
('57', 126, 21, 29, 217888) Government unaware of any authority or privilege over Guruvayur.
('57', 126, 21, 30, 217953) Kindly communicate Mr. Gandhi.” 2 The source has ‘burry’ which seems to be a slip for ‘Bhrrr’, which Gandhiji and the addressee used for each other in their correspondence.

('57', 127, 1, 2, 218168) the British Government’s acceptance of the Settlement related only to the part that was included in the British Government’s communal decision.
('57', 127, 1, 3, 218312) This was perhaps natural.
('57', 127, 1, 4, 218338) But I was bound to make my position clear—that I would be in honour bound to secure a due fulfilment of the whole of the settlement.
('57', 127, 1, 5, 218471) The second thing that I drew your attention to was that I would expect Government to continue the facilities given to me since 20th for seeing friends and sending messages in the matter of the untouchability question.
('57', 127, 1, 6, 218689) The British acceptance has reference only to the political part of the settlement, but the most vital part for the whole of the Hindu community is that relating to social and religious reform.
('57', 127, 1, 7, 218882) In order to set it on a firm footing it is necessary for me to be in touch with the workers for some time to come.
('57', 127, 1, 8, 218997) In order to avoid any misunderstanding therefore I mentioned this very important thing to you before breaking the fast.

('57', 128, 3, 4, 219363) MIRA, God is great and compassionate.
('57', 128, 3, 5, 219401) He would not try His servants beyond endurance.
('57', 128, 3, 6, 219449) And so the Government reply came in time to enable me to break the fast yesterday 5 p.m.
('57', 128, 3, 7, 219538) The Poet led the prayer and he was followed by the leper prisoner Parachure Shastri who was for some time at the Ashram.
('57', 128, 3, 8, 219659) This is enough for today.

('57', 128, 8, 12, 219776) MIRA, I had two letters from you yesterday.
('57', 128, 8, 13, 219820) I wrote a brief note 1 my self which I hope you got.
('57', 128, 8, 14, 219873) Something has gone to you daily from here and the I.G. assured me that my letters would be given to you at once.
('57', 128, 8, 15, 219986) So I cannot understand this absence of delivery of my letters.
('57', 128, 8, 16, 220049) However, all is over now.
('57', 128, 8, 17, 220075) I am taking plenty of oranges and grapes and am gaining strength.
('57', 128, 8, 18, 220141) Sleep is good.
('57', 128, 8, 19, 220156) There is therefore now no cause for anxiety.
('57', 128, 8, 20, 220201) The Orissa scene you describe and two others in Malabar have haunted me during these days and made the pangs bearale.
('57', 128, 8, 21, 220319) Gurudev’s coming was and still is a great solace.
('57', 128, 8, 22, 220369) He has been unstinting in his support.
('57', 128, 8, 23, 220408) I hope you are cheerful now.
('57', 128, 8, 24, 220437) Remember me to your compan ions.

('57', 129, 2, 3, 220638) September 28, 1932 I have already made my appeal to the caste Hindus as to their duty, but as a self chosen Harijan I would like to say a word to them also.
('57', 129, 2, 4, 220795) They have to perform their part during this period of purification.
('57', 129, 2, 5, 220863) Owing to suppression they have been deprived of ways and means of observing, and the incentive to the observation of, the ordinary laws of cleanliness and the like, but let us hope that a new era has dawned upon us.
('57', 129, 2, 6, 221079) I hope that Harijans will understand this and in so far as possible they will observe the laws of cleanliness, abstain from intoxicating liquors and drugs and make a mighty effort to get rid of all social evils.

('57', 129, 15, 22, 221880) One or two people will always be found who will oppose any reform to the end of time, but the question of wounding the hearts and self respect of thousands of depressed brethren is more real and important than the alleged wounding of the orthodox conscience.”

('57', 130, 30, 46, 223915) In my opinion, my stopping the fast would set back the movement.

('57', 131, 6, 7, 224275) September 29, 1932 (1.45 p.
('57', 131, 7, 8, 224303) DEAR MAJOR BHANDARI,
('57', 131, 8, 9, 224324) The orders you verbally conveyed to me at 12.30 this morning I interpret as follows: I am not to be allowed to see from this date any visitors regarding untouchability or any other public work, except Sjts.
('57', 131, 8, 10, 224531) Ghanshyamdas Birla and Mathuradas Vasanji.
('57', 131, 8, 11, 224574) Secondly Mrs. Gandhi should be forthwith removed to the Female Yard; all other visits to be regulated as before the fast, under the general instructions that were conveyed to me soon after my admission and amended thereafter.
('57', 131, 8, 12, 224800) This means that I shall not have the privilege of seeing Shrimati Sarojinidevi, whose presence during my illnesses has produced a soothing effect on me, nor of my son Devdas and his intended wife, nor of the Ashram inmates who have been in attendance upon me during this crisis.
('57', 131, 8, 13, 225079) I must confess that I was wholly unprepared for this very sudden and rude reminder that I was but a prisoner whose body was entirely at the mercy of the Government.
('57', 131, 8, 14, 225244) I would like, however, the Government to know that I am still considered to be convalescent and under orders not even to move from my bed.
('57', 131, 8, 15, 225383) I had hoped that at least during the convalescent period I would be saved all unnecessary shock to my nerves.
('57', 131, 8, 16, 225493) However, this need not be a matter of moment to the Government and ought not to worry me overmuch, if at all.
('57', 131, 8, 17, 225603) Indeed I am thankful for the medical attendance that the Government provided for me and the free attendance of visitors and friends during the fast.
('57', 131, 8, 18, 225752) But what I cannot understand is this sudden stopping of all visits, even in connection with untouchability work, save those of Sjts.
('57', 131, 8, 19, 225885) Ghanshyamdas and Mathuradas.
('57', 131, 8, 20, 225914) The Government cannot be unaware of the phenomenal awakening that has taken place in the country, nor of the repercussions of the fast whose limitations have been but little understood and which is being blindly imitated by enthusiastic young men.
('57', 131, 8, 21, 226162) I therfore hold it absolutely necessary that I should be left
('57', 132, 0, 1, 226224) VOL. 57 : 5 SEPTEMBER, 1932 15 NOVEMBER, 1932 133
('57', 132, 1, 2, 226274) entirely free to see whomsoever I consider necessary regarding untouchability.
('57', 132, 1, 3, 226353) The Government have not yet seemed to have revised their instructions regarding correspondence.
('57', 132, 1, 4, 226449) Needless to say what applied to visitors regarding untouchability applies equally to correspondence.
('57', 132, 1, 5, 226550) Nor need I add that I should not have the slightest objection to Government officials and interpreters attending any interviews I might have with visitors and my correspondence being scrutinized.
('57', 132, 1, 6, 226746) As this is a matter of the greatest urgency, I hope that the Government will favour me with their decision at the earliest possible moment.
('57', 132, 2, 7, 226886) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI

('57', 132, 6, 13, 227227) And that has been my principal food.
('57', 132, 6, 14, 227264) Yesterday I took thin soup made of turai 1. Today I propose to take milk.
('57', 132, 6, 15, 227338) Your letters have come in regularly.
('57', 132, 6, 16, 227375) I cannot understand why mine have not been received by you.
('57', 132, 6, 17, 227435) I am inquiring.
('57', 132, 6, 18, 227451) Strength is rapidly coming.
('57', 132, 6, 19, 227479) There was yesterday already a gain
('57', 132, 7, 20, 227514) of 11 2 lb., i.e., 95 lb.
('57', 132, 8, 21, 227540) I did write to Romain Rolland.
('57', 132, 8, 22, 227571) 2 There was a cable from him on the break of the fast.
('57', 132, 8, 23, 227626) I read your message to Gurudev yesterday and I touched his feet for you, as Mahadev, poet like, had forgotten to do so.
('57', 132, 8, 24, 227746) Ba, of course, forgot all her misery as soon as she came here.
('57', 132, 8, 25, 227809) She seems to have borne it all very bravely indeed.

('57', 133, 6, 9, 228264) I hope to be strong enough to write in two or three days.
('57', 133, 6, 10, 228322) This morning, after eating some fruit I wrote four or five letters which seemed urgent to me.
('57', 133, 7, 11, 228416) I suppose you have heard the news of Trivedi’s 1 sister in law having died in an accident.

('57', 133, 12, 16, 228661) Your very first wire showed what my fast meant to you.
('57', 133, 12, 17, 228716) For me it was the clearest call from God.
('57', 133, 12, 18, 228758) Events have converted even the scoffers.
('57', 133, 12, 19, 228799) I did expect a mighty response from the orthodox, but I was unprepared for the sudden manifestation that took place.
('57', 133, 12, 20, 228916) But I shall not be deceived.
('57', 133, 12, 21, 228945) It remains to be seen whether the temples opened remain open and the various other things done persist.
('57', 133, 12, 22, 229049) This breaking of the fast is therefore but a suspension.
('57', 133, 12, 23, 229106) However, I am not worrying.
('57', 133, 12, 24, 229134) The fast and its breaking were God’s doing.
('57', 133, 12, 25, 229178) And so will the resumption be, if it is to come.
('57', 133, 12, 26, 229227) Gurudev’s visit was a blessing.
('57', 133, 12, 27, 229259) We have come nearer each other than ever before.
('57', 133, 12, 28, 229308) I do not know if Mahadev had time to tell you how

('57', 135, 5, 7, 231037) I was glad to know these brethren.

('57', 135, 9, 12, 231184) MY DEAR AGATHA,
('57', 135, 10, 13, 231200) I could read your agony through your cable and your letter.
('57', 135, 10, 14, 231260) But it was all well worth it.
('57', 135, 10, 15, 231290) I was glad you had Charlie Andrews by your side.
('57', 135, 10, 16, 231339) I had fullest faith in your doing all you could.
('57', 135, 10, 17, 231388) Nothing more could be expected of anyone.
('57', 135, 10, 18, 231430) As you would perhaps be reading one another’s letters, I am not saying more is this brief love note.

('57', 136, 3, 5, 231751) It was an experience well worth having, if only for the sake of the love it evoked from all parts of the world and the wave of reform that passed from one end of India to the other.

('57', 136, 7, 9, 232013) MY DEAR CHILD, Even from this distance I could realize your agony.
('57', 136, 7, 10, 232080) But God never comes to us except through the way of fire.
('57', 136, 7, 11, 232138) There is a deep unconscious joy felt during such purifying agony.
('57', 136, 7, 12, 232204) I hope that you were partaker of such joy during the trial.
('57', 136, 7, 13, 232264) I saw or rather heard your name together with those of Horace Alexander and Andrews among the senders of a loving message from England.
('57', 136, 7, 14, 232400) I am growing stronger day by day.
('57', 136, 7, 15, 232434) You won't expect a long letter from me today.

('57', 136, 12, 23, 232851) It was travail of new birth, which it has been undoubtedly to me, as I think it has been to superstitious ignorant Hindiusm.
('57', 136, 12, 24, 232976) The great manifestation was worth fasting for.
('57', 136, 12, 25, 233023) Tokens of love from outside India, from England, have been also many and true.
('57', 136, 12, 26, 233102) The threefold agony was much eased by the knowledge of all these things.

('57', 138, 3, 5, 234618) It was so vital that you needed no effort to restrain yourselves from running to me as so many friends did.
('57', 138, 3, 6, 234726) Yes, the prophecy or presentiment of Mrs. Abbas has come true.

('57', 139, 2, 4, 235519) September 30, 1932 I suffered much physically during this fast.
('57', 139, 2, 5, 235583) As atonement for our sins against the Antyajas, that suffering was certainly worth it.
('57', 139, 2, 6, 235670) The body, however, is a shirker.

('57', 142, 3, 4, 239189) MIRA, As you were not getting my letters regularly I purposely refrained from writing to you yesterday.
('57', 142, 3, 5, 239293) This I am writing early morning just after taking oranges and grape juice.
('57', 142, 3, 6, 239368) I am flourishing, my weight showeed 993 4 yesterday against 931 2 which was the weight on Monday.
('57', 142, 3, 7, 239466) This is a wonderful improvement.
('57', 142, 3, 8, 239499) In a day or two, I shall be walking a little.
('57', 142, 3, 9, 239545) The bowels require the enema still but I expect them to be normal soon.
('57', 142, 3, 10, 239617) Food is oranges eight, grapes, glucose powder four tea spoons, milk 11 2 Ib., clear vegetable soup marrow and tomatoes.
('57', 142, 3, 11, 239737) Of these I take something on an average every 21 2 hours.
('57', 142, 3, 12, 239795) I spun yesterday 235 rounds without feeling much tired.
('57', 142, 3, 13, 239851) The spinning was done in two periods.
('57', 142, 3, 14, 239889) Wrote a number of letters for the English mail and to correspondents here.
('57', 142, 3, 15, 239964) With intervals for meals and rest, etc.
('57', 142, 3, 16, 240004) I worked till 8 p.m.
('57', 142, 3, 17, 240025) yesterday and now feel none the worse for it.
('57', 142, 3, 18, 240071) All this is very good progress.
('57', 142, 3, 19, 240103) And so I continue to hum, ‘God is great and merciful.’ The fast was nothing compared to what it brought forth.

('57', 142, 3, 22, 240264) All this must remove your sadness.
('57', 142, 3, 23, 240299) You must have seen from the papers that as to interviews, etc., the pre fast restrictions are practically in force.
('57', 142, 3, 24, 240415) Ba can see me during the day.

('57', 143, 10, 18, 241462) If He tolerates all that, then the misuse of great powers which may follow an attempt to use them rightly should also be tolerated.
('57', 143, 10, 19, 241594) However, as you suggest we should make every effort to prevent such misuse.

('57', 144, 3, 6, 242209) The outcome of the fast was not man’s achievement.
('57', 144, 3, 7, 242260) I do not even feel that ‘I’ have done something.
('57', 144, 3, 8, 242309) The Gita says: “Do everything as My instrument, and offer it to Me as sacrifice.” I feel thus every moment and experience the intensest joy.

('57', 145, 3, 5, 243408) Your bhajans are very good.
('57', 145, 3, 6, 243436) What does it matter if the bhajan which was sung when I commenced the fast was not yours?
('57', 145, 3, 7, 243526) After all, it was a fine bhajan which you yourself had sent.
('57', 145, 3, 8, 243587) Of course I would have felt much happier if it had been yours.
('57', 145, 3, 9, 243650) But never mind.
('57', 145, 3, 10, 243666) When God grants me another opportunity for undertaking a fast, I should like to have a bhajan composed by you.
('57', 145, 3, 11, 243777) Compose one right now.

('57', 146, 11, 14, 244881) October 2, 1932 I can understand your reasoning.
('57', 146, 11, 15, 244930) 4 Only my fast is not intended to coerce anybody.
('57', 146, 11, 16, 244980) It is meant to quicken into life sluggish con science.
('57', 146, 11, 17, 245035) That it may coerce some is unfortunately true.
('57', 146, 11, 18, 245082) But such coercion can neither be prolonged nor extensive.
('57', 146, 11, 19, 245140) A religious reformer does not attempt to dominate the mind.
('57', 146, 11, 20, 245200) He stirs up people and makes them think and act.
('57', 146, 11, 21, 245249) I must not purchase my release at the sacrifice of my principles.
('57', 146, 11, 22, 245315) Removal of untouchability is a vital part of my life’s programme, but it is not the sole part of it.
('57', 146, 11, 23, 245416) 5 My life is in God’s hands.
('57', 146, 11, 24, 245445) He will shape it as He wills.
('57', 146, 11, 25, 245475) Do you not think I am in safe hands?

('57', 146, 13, 29, 245863) 3 In “Diary, 1932” Gandhiji, in the entry under October 3, mentions having sent a telegram to the addressee the previous day.
('57', 146, 13, 30, 245989) Presumably this is the telegram.
('57', 146, 13, 31, 246022) 4 The addressee had advised Gandhiji that instead of seeking to coerce through fasting he should use the method of peaceful persuasion.
('57', 146, 13, 32, 246158) 5 The addressee had further said that if he were to declare that he would only work for the removal of untouchability for a year he might be released.

('57', 147, 2, 3, 246379) October 2, 1932
('57', 147, 3, 4, 246395) PURATAN, You have asked a good question.
('57', 147, 3, 5, 246436) Arjuna did not know what to do and he asked [Krishna] 1 to guide him.
('57', 147, 3, 6, 246506) No such doubt had arisen in my mind, but Krishna himself roused me and urged me not to miss this opportunity.
('57', 147, 3, 7, 246616) An indefinite fast may be the highest expression of ahimsa and it may even be folly.
('57', 147, 3, 8, 246701) I believe that my fast was the former.
('57', 147, 3, 9, 246740) The outcome also seems to indicate that it was so.
('57', 147, 3, 10, 246791) Fasting has a place, and an important one, in the tapascharya enjoined 2 in Hindu dharma.
('57', 147, 3, 11, 246881) Thus there is a difference between Arjuna’s case and [mine].
('57', 147, 3, 12, 246942) I don’t wish to suggest by this that I have more knowledge than Arjuna.
('57', 147, 3, 13, 247014) I only wish to point out that in this instance it was not a question of ignorance in me.
('57', 147, 3, 14, 247103) Is this clear ?
('57', 147, 3, 15, 247119) You must have read in the newspapers that visitors are no longer permitted to see me.

('57', 148, 7, 9, 247885) October 2, 1932 There is no doubt that the vow which you contemplate is excellent.
('57', 148, 7, 10, 247968) If you have arrived at the decision independently on your own, there is no need to discuss the matter with Nimu for the present.
('57', 148, 7, 11, 248097) Your peace of mind is bound to have its effect on her.
('57', 148, 7, 12, 248152) That is the beauty of brahmacharya.
('57', 148, 7, 13, 248188) The need for mutual discussion arises when both are equally weak in mind, but equally eager to practise self control also; for, then, the resolution of one partner helps the other.
('57', 148, 7, 14, 248369) When one partner has made up his or her mind, he or she will not discuss the matter with the other, as his or her self control will of itself work on the other.
('57', 148, 7, 15, 248530) This is only to tell you my own experience in the matter, and you are free to act as you think best.
('57', 148, 7, 16, 248631) In such matters other people’s wisdom does not avail one much.
('57', 148, 7, 17, 248694) In such a holy resolution you can of course take my blessings for granted, but take the vow only after you are released from prison.
('57', 148, 7, 18, 248827) Many have given up the vows they made while in prison.
('57', 148, 7, 19, 248882) The two environments are different.

('57', 148, 11, 27, 249216) You exercised good self control in not coming to see me.
('57', 148, 11, 28, 249273) If you had come, I would have certainly welcomed you and not found
('57', 149, 0, 1, 249340) 150 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

('57', 149, 1, 3, 249398) But I admire you the better for not coming.
('57', 149, 1, 4, 249442) The get up of Ashramvasi Pratye is beautiful indeed.
('57', 149, 1, 5, 249495) As for the contents, I have yet to look into them.
('57', 149, 1, 6, 249546) I know that anti untouchability work in villages is very difficult.
('57', 149, 1, 7, 249614) Only workers like you can judge how far the awakening witnessed during the week of the fast has spread among the villages.
('57', 149, 1, 8, 249737) I think the fast should have been longer for that to have happened.
('57', 149, 1, 9, 249805) But this is merely how the matter appears to human reason.
('57', 149, 1, 10, 249864) I fasted as long as it was God's will that I should.
('57', 149, 1, 11, 249917) Who knows how many more fasts He will make me undertake in future ?
('57', 149, 1, 12, 249985) We should thus be content to live as He wills, and be ready to dance with joy even if He throws us into a pan of boiling oil.
('57', 149, 1, 13, 250111) Has He not given His word that He will give us the strength to do so ?

('57', 149, 4, 17, 250285) HARI ICHCHHA, You have paid good attention to handwriting, but in the end spoilt the letter with blots of ink on the sheet.
('57', 149, 4, 18, 250409) The lesson to be drawn from this is that neatness cannot be learnt in a short time.
('57', 149, 4, 19, 250493) One should make a long and systematic effort to learn it.
('57', 149, 4, 20, 250551) Remember that you have taken a vow to shed your lethargy.
('57', 149, 4, 21, 250609) Keep your vow.
('57', 149, 4, 22, 250624) Write your address in every letter; I cannot keep a complete list of addresses here.
('57', 149, 4, 23, 250709) I hope the children are better now.
('57', 149, 4, 24, 250745) Do you see Raihanabehn sometimes?
('57', 149, 4, 25, 250779) I have written letters to the girls and enclosed them in the Ashram packet.

('57', 150, 3, 4, 251336) PREMA, I cannot write you a long letter today.
('57', 150, 3, 5, 251383) Who is afraid of your biting?
('57', 150, 3, 6, 251413) Our cat often bites its kittens, but the more she does that the more they cling to her.
('57', 150, 3, 7, 251501) When she lifts Soma 1 with her teeth, he does not cry but, on the contrary, feels more secure.
('57', 150, 3, 8, 251596) Your biting must be like the cat’s.
('57', 150, 3, 9, 251632) You have quoted fine verses indeed.
('57', 150, 3, 10, 251668) I admire your self control, too.
('57', 150, 3, 11, 251701) But neither you nor the other inmates of the Ashram need feel elated.
('57', 150, 3, 12, 251771) Old man Abbas, Raihana and others danced with joy when they knew the cause of my fast.
('57', 150, 3, 13, 251858) They did not even express a wish to come and see me.
('57', 150, 3, 14, 251911) They trusted that I was under God’s care and went on with their tasks.
('57', 150, 3, 15, 251982) Others, too, acted in the same manner.
('57', 150, 3, 16, 252021) Tell me, now, how much weight did you gain during my fast ?

('57', 151, 8, 13, 252897) It is very easy.
('57', 151, 8, 14, 252914) Every time you spend something, you should note down the particulars immediately.
('57', 151, 8, 15, 252996) It is not necessary to make a fair copy of the notes.
('57', 151, 8, 16, 253050) You can send the same sheet to Narandas.
('57', 151, 8, 17, 253091) If there is a swelling on your arm, you should stop even spinning.
('57', 151, 8, 18, 253158) You must take care and see that you never get tired.

('57', 152, 3, 5, 253717) You have done no wrong in starting wearing bangles.
('57', 152, 3, 6, 253769) The mistake lay in your resolution not to wear them, and so I think that you have now made amends for the mistake by wearing them to please the elders in the family.
('57', 152, 3, 7, 253935) Let this be a lesson to you that all resolutions should be made after careful thinking, and that once you have made a resolution you should not give it up for anybody’s sake.
('57', 152, 3, 8, 254110) Do not brood over what has happened.
('57', 152, 3, 9, 254147) Live on milk, vegetables and fruit if rotli does not agree.
('57', 152, 3, 10, 254207) Milk of course includes curds and buttermilk.
('57', 152, 3, 11, 254253) Aren’t the children still in a condition to live in the Ashram?
('57', 152, 3, 12, 254317) Pay a visit to the Ashram and see how things are there at present.
('57', 152, 3, 13, 254384) If you cannot do that, don’t shift them from Calcutta but be satisfied with what you can do for them there.
('57', 152, 3, 14, 254492) Ultimately their place is in the Ashram, and, to accustom them to the Ashram you should live there for a short time, if necessary.

('57', 153, 8, 14, 255538) NARANDAS,
('57', 153, 9, 15, 255548) The accompanying letters will give you an indication of my strength.
('57', 153, 9, 16, 255617) I have now regained a good deal of it.
('57', 153, 9, 17, 255656) I became weaker than I had thought, but I am recovering rapidly.
('57', 153, 9, 18, 255721) On the Sunday during my fast, my weight was 931 2 pounds.
('57', 153, 9, 19, 255779) Today, which is again a Sunday, it stands at 100 pounds.
('57', 153, 9, 20, 255836) This is good improvement.
('57', 153, 9, 21, 255862) My diet at present is a pound and a half of milk, eight to ten oranges, pomegranate or grape juice, soup of gourd and tomatoes, honey and lemon juice.
('57', 153, 9, 22, 256013) I hope that I shall be able to increase the quantity of milk by a little.
('57', 153, 9, 23, 256087) I don’t expect I shall make any other change for some time.
('57', 153, 9, 24, 256147) I walked a little yesterday and today.
('57', 153, 9, 25, 256186) The quantity of stool has increased today in the natural course.
('57', 153, 9, 26, 256251) I sleep fairly well.
('57', 153, 9, 27, 256272) Ba spends the whole day with me.
('57', 153, 9, 28, 256305) In the evening, she goes to Lady Vithaldas’s place.
('57', 153, 9, 29, 256357) I suffered much during the fast but enjoyed boundless peace.
('57', 153, 9, 30, 256418) God tested me fairly severely.
('57', 153, 9, 31, 256449) Yet on the whole the test was light.
('57', 153, 9, 32, 256486) A seven days’ fast means nothing to me.
('57', 153, 9, 33, 256526) But the physical and mental suffering during this short period was considerable.
('57', 153, 9, 34, 256607) I cannot say how
('57', 153, 10, 35, 256624) 1 Although in Mahadevbhaini Diary, Vol. II, this letter is mentioned under October 3, from the contents it appears to have been written on October 2, which was a Sunday.

('57', 154, 1, 3, 256935) I don’t mean that experience is a state of perfect knowledge.
('57', 154, 1, 4, 256997) It is an experience which cannot be explained in words.
('57', 154, 1, 5, 257053) Even perfect knowledge is not an experience of perfect rea lization.
('57', 154, 1, 6, 257122) I was happy that you and the others who came and saw me did so.
('57', 154, 1, 7, 257186) Those who did not come must be said to have exercised great self control.
('57', 154, 1, 8, 257260) I think both those who came and those who did not, did right.
('57', 154, 1, 9, 257322) May this yajna inspire us to strive for greater self purification and lead us to greater awakening.

('57', 158, 8, 18, 261569) Did I tell you that I was able to see Father Winslow and other members of the Sangh?
('57', 158, 8, 19, 261654) It was a joy to see them.
('57', 158, 8, 20, 261680) I have been writing so many letters that I do not remember them or their contents.

('57', 161, 2, 4, 264133) Your sannyasa will shine only when you return to the Ashram with true understanding and devote yourself to service in a spirit of non attachment.
('57', 161, 2, 5, 264279) A stone cave or a cremation ground are not the real cave or the cremation ground.

('57', 161, 2, 7, 264397) One may be truly said to have embraced sannyasa only when one lives in that cave and reduces to ashes all impure thoughts and feelings in oneself.

('57', 164, 13, 23, 268295) You should take hip bath in cold water.
('57', 164, 13, 24, 268335) But it should be taken before menstruation, not during it.
('57', 164, 13, 25, 268394) Then there is friction bath, about which Premabehn will probably know.
('57', 164, 13, 26, 268465) Santok is likely to know about it too.
('57', 164, 13, 27, 268504) You must take complete rest during the period.

('57', 165, 1, 4, 268799) There are natural differences between males and females.
('57', 165, 1, 5, 268856) Hence, their functions too are somewhat different.
('57', 165, 1, 6, 268907) This being the case, if a man tries to perform the functions of a woman or a woman that of a man, there is bound to be trouble.
('57', 165, 1, 7, 269035) But they can overcome most of the difficulties.
('57', 165, 1, 8, 269083) Such a situation can be reached only when an atmosphere of physical and psychological purity is created.
('57', 165, 1, 9, 269188) You may find this point difficult to grasp.
('57', 165, 1, 10, 269232) Read the letter twice or thrice.
('57', 165, 1, 11, 269265) If you still do not catch the point, consult Chimanlal 1 or Narandas or Premabehn and then let me know what you have understood.
('57', 165, 1, 12, 269394) We feel shy to talk about these things and feel less shy writing about them because we do not have to face and hear the other person.
('57', 165, 1, 13, 269528) It is easy to write sitting far away but we feel shy when two pairs of eyes meet.

('57', 167, 12, 23, 272621) The lost strength will take a little time.

('57', 167, 12, 25, 272711) It was a little penance for the great sin of untouchability committed by millions against their fellow beings.
('57', 167, 12, 26, 272822) But you know all about it by now.
('57', 167, 12, 27, 272856) You must try to get rid of your rheumatism by steam baths and a diet free of much starch and proteids and full of fresh fruit.
('57', 167, 12, 28, 272983) I wish you could persuade Nan and Tangai to go to a public school and live down the prejudice, i.e., if the teachers welcome the idea of their going there.

('57', 169, 6, 18, 275425) I experience no difficulty in attending to my correspondence.
('57', 169, 6, 19, 275487) I do not at all like that people in the Ashram should fall ill.
('57', 169, 6, 20, 275551) There is some carelessness behind these illnesses.
('57', 169, 6, 21, 275602) During this month when people generally fall ill, you should be very careful about food.
('57', 169, 6, 22, 275691) The root cause of most illnesses is impaired digestion.

('57', 170, 6, 18, 277418) Does anybody know when death, who ever stalks us like a shadow, will catch us by the throat?
('57', 170, 6, 19, 277511) I know that Manu will be shocked, but he is a brave boy and will bear the blow.
('57', 170, 6, 20, 277591) If, by way of shraddha for Taragouri, you banish the primus stove from your family, that will not be too great a sacrifice, and probably it will save other women from this monster.

('57', 173, 8, 27, 281130) I do not think I take more than one and a half hours.
('57', 173, 8, 28, 281184) My weight stands at 99 lb.
('57', 173, 8, 29, 281211) Now that I take some exercise, the weight cannot and must not increase by leaps.
('57', 173, 8, 30, 281292) I have taken two pounds of milk today and for the first time, 20 dates.
('57', 173, 8, 31, 281364) Ba is with me during the day, feeding and nursing me.
('57', 173, 8, 32, 281418) I have to give much time to correspondence as the volume has increased enormously.
('57', 173, 8, 33, 281501) I wrote a note to Kisen.
('57', 173, 8, 34, 281526) I wonder if she received it.
('57', 173, 8, 35, 281555) Narandas has got the permission to see you, if you would care to see him.
('57', 173, 8, 36, 281629) Do you get all the letters collected during the week or only one per week?
('57', 173, 8, 37, 281704) So you see that you cannot build a theory on a few days’ or even months’ observation.
('57', 173, 8, 38, 281790) Do not now try to fix the quantity of salt mechanically.
('57', 173, 8, 39, 281847) The quantity will adjust itself.

('57', 174, 1, 2, 282042) always help.
('57', 174, 1, 3, 282055) If you are melting and can stand cold water, you should take two or three quick cold baths.
('57', 174, 1, 4, 282147) And you should try deep breathing.
('57', 174, 1, 5, 282182) It cools the body at once.
('57', 174, 1, 6, 282209) This is done through the mouth as when you are whistling.
('57', 174, 1, 7, 282267) Try in the open air to breathe in the air and you will instantaneously find the cooling effect.
('57', 174, 1, 8, 282363) And do not stint yourself for fresh fruit.
('57', 174, 1, 9, 282406) Take as many oranges as you like, and raw tomatoes (ripe of course).
('57', 174, 1, 10, 282475) Mahadev had forgotten to give your message to Gurudev and touch his feet on your behalf.
('57', 174, 1, 11, 282564) So, having your letter by me, I read the portion to him and, much to his embarrassment, touched his feet on your behalf.
('57', 174, 1, 12, 282685) He sat speechless, expressing gratefulness through his expression.
('57', 174, 1, 13, 282752) I am glad you and Kisen are working at making perfect slivers.
('57', 174, 1, 14, 282815) They are the key to fine spinning.
('57', 174, 1, 15, 282850) I am just now spinning 45 counts quite easily.
('57', 174, 1, 16, 282897) Probably the count is finer.
('57', 174, 1, 17, 282926) It will be tested tomorrow.
('57', 174, 1, 18, 282954) Horace, Esther, Muriel and many other friends who write to me always mention you and want me to send you their love.
('57', 174, 1, 19, 283071) I am so very bad at conveying these messages.
('57', 174, 1, 20, 283117) I must not omit the Italian sisters who have been sending beautiful letters.

('57', 175, 2, 4, 283934) But you and I must not judge him.
('57', 175, 2, 5, 283968) After all even the strongest have to compromise to an extent.

('57', 175, 6, 12, 284187) I am regaining my lost strength rapidly.

('57', 175, 6, 14, 284258) I have gone through many and more prolonged fasts.
('57', 175, 6, 15, 284309) But none was so joy giving.
('57', 175, 6, 16, 284337) It seems that the work there is too trying for you.
('57', 175, 6, 17, 284389) Of course you must not work beyond your strength.

('57', 176, 8, 14, 285725) And why the fear of death?
('57', 176, 8, 15, 285752) That is in store for all.

('57', 177, 10, 17, 286679) I am still anxiously waiting for Government’s reply to my letter of the 29th ult.

('57', 177, 10, 19, 286846) Meanwhile arising out of Sjt.
('57', 177, 10, 20, 286876) Kelappan’s fast in South India I had to send a long telegram 3 to the Zamorin, Calicut, which was referred to the Government and which so far as I am aware, has not still gone to the Zamorin.
('57', 177, 10, 21, 287068) Now that matter is one of life and death and though Sjt.
('57', 177, 10, 22, 287125) Kelappan’s fast has been suspended at my instance, he is by no means yet out of the wood.
('57', 177, 10, 23, 287215) And now I am necessarily dragged into it because of my successful intervention.
('57', 177, 10, 24, 287295) The Zamorin of Calicut is the central figure in this controversy.
('57', 177, 10, 25, 287361) Kelappan’s fast is suspended only for three months.
('57', 177, 10, 26, 287413) There is not therefore much time to be wasted.
('57', 177, 10, 27, 287460) I should therefore like to know when this telegram will be sent to the Zamorin and whether I am free to carry on correspondence in connection with untouch ability.
('57', 177, 10, 28, 287624) Delay is a matter of great danger and vexation.

('57', 178, 5, 11, 288288) Yes, it would be tragic if God was accessible only to the learned.
('57', 178, 5, 12, 288355) My feeling coincides with your washer woman’s.
('57', 178, 5, 13, 288402) There was once a scientific expedition in search of God.
('57', 178, 5, 14, 288459) The scientists are reported to have come to India and to have found God not in the homes of Brahmins, nor in the palaces of kings, but they found Him in a hut of an untouchable.
('57', 178, 5, 15, 288637) Hence my cry to God to admit me to the untouchable fold.
('57', 178, 5, 16, 288694) After fifty years of trial they found me worthy to be so admitted.
('57', 178, 5, 17, 288761) And I rejoice over the event.

('57', 179, 2, 3, 289488) October 6, 1932 Let this suffice as a brief answer to your questions.
('57', 179, 2, 4, 289558) Inter dining and intermarriage are not an essential part of removal of untouchability root and branch.
('57', 179, 2, 5, 289661) These two form a separate reform and must come one day for all sections of Hinduism.
('57', 179, 2, 6, 289746) Nothing can be or should be done by compulsion.
('57', 179, 2, 7, 289794) Fasting and the like are not designed to compel people to act against their wills, they are designed to make people think and act.
('57', 179, 2, 8, 289925) If untouchables are no longer untouchable what are they in Hindu society?
('57', 179, 2, 9, 289999) My own opinion is that the varna system has just now broken down.
('57', 179, 2, 10, 290065) There is no true Brahmin or true Kshatriya or Vaishya.
('57', 179, 2, 11, 290120) We are all Shudras, i.e., one varna.
('57', 179, 2, 12, 290157) If this position is accepted, then the thing becomes easy.
('57', 179, 2, 13, 290216) If this does not satisfy our vanity, then we are all Brahmins.
('57', 179, 2, 14, 290279) Removal of untouchability does mean root and branch destruction of the idea of superiority and inferiority.
('57', 179, 2, 15, 290387) He who says, ‘ I am more than my fellow’ debases himself; he who says, ‘I am the least among my fellows’ raises himself.
('57', 179, 2, 16, 290508) My fast was intended not to deal with the question superficially but to make us true.
('57', 179, 2, 17, 290594) I wish I could mechanically fix the time limit.
('57', 179, 2, 18, 290642) Who am I to do so?
('57', 179, 2, 19, 290661) But this I can say from my past, there will be no fast in this matter if the reform is progressing steadily and there is no humbug or make believe behind it.
('57', 179, 2, 20, 290819) Real progress is self demonstrated.
('57', 179, 2, 21, 290855) The Harijans will feel its glow in unmistakable terms.
('57', 179, 2, 22, 290910) I would beseech you therefore not to worry about the time limit.
('57', 179, 2, 23, 290975) We all believe in idols and images of some sort.
('57', 179, 2, 24, 291024) The ordinary temple has no attraction for me personally.
('57', 179, 2, 25, 291081) But it has a tremendous spiritual value.
('57', 179, 2, 26, 291122) Therefore it must be open to Harjians.
('57', 179, 2, 27, 291161) Reform of temples, not their destruction, is necessary.

('57', 181, 3, 9, 292416) The same has been the case with many other letters of mine.

('57', 183, 2, 3, 294864) October 7, 1932 Inter dining and intermarrying with Antyajas are not a nece ssary part of the movement for the eradication of untouchability.
('57', 183, 2, 4, 295006) There can be no coercion in these matters.
('57', 183, 2, 5, 295049) Nor should anybody be prevented from having such relations with untouchables if he wishes, just as nobody is prevented from having them with members of other communities.
('57', 183, 2, 6, 295220) Eradication of untouchability has nothing to do with inter dining and intermarrying.

('57', 183, 5, 10, 295391) October 7, 1932
('57', 183, 6, 11, 295407) NIRMALA, You must have got my postcards 1. All who go to Nasik or write to a prisoner there should remember what I have explained.
('57', 183, 6, 12, 295538) Anybody who goes to Thana or writes to someone there may also make use of it.
('57', 183, 7, 13, 295616) I got two letters from Kishorelal and one from Gomati.
('57', 183, 7, 14, 295671) I need not say anything about the propriety or otherwise of the fast.
('57', 183, 7, 15, 295741) There was certainly some defect in it, but the fast was absolutely necessary.
('57', 183, 7, 16, 295819) It may be regarded as the ultimate step in non violence.
('57', 183, 7, 17, 295876) I am now gradually regaining my strength.
('57', 183, 7, 18, 295918) In fact I have regained most of it.
('57', 183, 7, 19, 295954) The weight, which had gone down to 93.5 lb has now risen to 99. Before the fast it was 101. I am sure that on the whole the fast will benefit my health.
('57', 183, 7, 20, 296107) My daily food consists of 2lb.of milk, nine oranges or mosambis juice of pomegranates or grapes, and gourd or tomato soup once a day.
('57', 183, 7, 21, 296241) I walk in the morning and in the evening for a total of an hour and a half without getting tired, write quite a large number of letters, and spin at least 200 rounds, going up to as far as 40 counts.
('57', 183, 7, 22, 296441) Ba is allowed to stay with me during the day.
('57', 183, 7, 23, 296487) Devdas is permitted to come and see me.
('57', 183, 7, 24, 296527) It is necessary that we should spin as fine yarn as we can.
('57', 183, 7, 25, 296587) I also admit the moral blemish in wearing clothes of fine yarn, but fine cloth

('57', 184, 1, 2, 296786) has also some benefits.
('57', 184, 1, 3, 296810) It is very necessary from an artistic point of view.
('57', 184, 1, 4, 296863) In the attempt to spin fine yarn, one makes many discoveries.
('57', 184, 1, 5, 296925) It makes for deftness of the hand.
('57', 184, 1, 6, 296960) In the past the people were forced to spin fine yarn.
('57', 184, 1, 7, 297014) Even as atonement for that, some of us ought to spin fine yarn as part of the yajna of spinning, so that the yarn spun by them might be available whenever fine cloth is found to be absolutely necessary.
('57', 184, 1, 8, 297217) If we have to pay the full labour charges for fine yarn, the cost of such cloth would be exceedingly high.
('57', 184, 1, 9, 297324) It was not proper for Kishorelal to have insisted on spinning a thousand rounds during the week of the fast.
('57', 184, 1, 10, 297433) He should have recognized his limitations in this matter.
('57', 184, 1, 11, 297491) One learns real humility by doing so.
('57', 184, 1, 12, 297529) One may, if one wishes, do labour which is easier even than spinning.
('57', 184, 1, 13, 297599) But those who cannot do any manual work can also serve through their thoughts and writings.
('57', 184, 1, 14, 297691) He is a thief who has hands but does not use them to do any work.
('57', 184, 1, 15, 297757) I like the verse as amended: “I wish I could always employ my all in relieving some creatures’ pain.” 1
('57', 184, 2, 16, 297861) Kishorelal knows that Nath had some doubt about the moral propriety of my fast.
('57', 184, 2, 17, 297941) At my request, Nath came and discussed the matter a little with me during the fast.
('57', 184, 2, 18, 298025) I do not know whether he was finally convinced.
('57', 184, 2, 19, 298073) Rabindranath went the furthest he could this time.
('57', 184, 2, 20, 298124) We have come very close to each other.
('57', 184, 2, 21, 298163) I don’t think I have left out anything.

('57', 187, 3, 4, 301335) BHAISHRI MOHANLAL, You are right in your view that inter dining and inter marrying with Antyajas are not a necessary part of the movement for the eradication of untouchability.
('57', 187, 3, 5, 301512) Hence there can be no coercion brought to bear on anybody in regard to these.
('57', 187, 3, 6, 301590) If, however, anybody wishes of his own free will to have such relations with Antyajas, he should not be prevented from doing so, just as members of “touchable” communities are not prevented from having such relations among themselves.
('57', 187, 3, 7, 301825) Eradication of untouchability means permitting Harijans, and persuading others to permit them, to enjoy the rights which as a human being every Hindu enjoys.

('57', 187, 6, 10, 302042) 343. LETTER TO MOHANLAL M. BHATT
('57', 187, 7, 11, 302075) October, 8, 1932 There was some merit in Mohamad Kaji’s decision to observe the roza.
('57', 187, 7, 12, 302161) Islam enjoins keeping of the roza during a time of mis fortune.
('57', 187, 7, 13, 302225) One other Muslim friend also had kept the roza at that time.
('57', 187, 7, 14, 302286) The roza is not a fast.
('57', 187, 7, 15, 302310) In this matter Muslim friends should earnestly wish that, just as the problem of the Antyajas has been solved, that of the Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs also may be solved, and should do their duty towards that end.
('57', 187, 7, 16, 302522) A solution of the problem from the religious point of view was certainly one of the aims of my fast.
('57', 187, 7, 17, 302623) The Hindu public realized this without any propaganda for that purpose, and the great awakening that has come about is indeed of a religious nature.
('57', 187, 7, 18, 302772) From the religious standpoint the Government award would have destroyed the Antyajas.
('57', 187, 7, 19, 302858) As compared with that aspect of the problem, the political aspect was insignificant.
('57', 187, 7, 20, 302943) Politics is included in religion and is not an independent activity.
('57', 187, 7, 21, 303012) The solution of the Antyajas problem from a religious point of view includes the solution of the problem of all oppressed races in the world.
('57', 187, 7, 22, 303154) The Christians and Muslims also seem to have grasped this point.
('57', 187, 7, 23, 303219) I see no violation of principle in a teetotaller present at a feast
('57', 188, 0, 1, 303287) VOL. 57 : 5 SEPTEMBER, 1932 15 NOVEMBER, 1932 189
('57', 188, 1, 2, 303337) passing a glass of wine.
('57', 188, 1, 3, 303362) If one attends such a feast, it is one’s duty, according to me, to pass the glass and there is no hypocrisy in doing so.
('57', 188, 1, 4, 303483) That is one way of quietly winning the love of the people who drink.
('57', 188, 1, 5, 303552) This argument applies only to a strict teetotaller, and the question also was put with reference to such a person.

('57', 188, 5, 12, 303921) Do what you think best.
('57', 188, 5, 13, 303945) I cannot guide you from here.
('57', 188, 5, 14, 303975) Think over the pledge which was taken.
('57', 188, 5, 15, 304014) It should not be violated in the slightest degree.
('57', 188, 5, 16, 304065) This does not mean that I know anything in the matter.
('57', 188, 5, 17, 304120) I don’t remember everything now.
('57', 188, 5, 18, 304153) This is why I have aways insisted that whenever a person takes a vow, he should immediately write it down.
('57', 188, 5, 19, 304260) If he does not do that, afterwards his resoultion weakens and he interprets the vow to make it much milder.
('57', 188, 5, 20, 304368) I have often been guilty of such behaviour myself and my conscience has pricked me afterwards.

('57', 188, 11, 26, 304589) Have you requested me not to take the trouble of writing to you, so that you also may not have to write to me?
('57', 188, 11, 27, 304700) But how can I, when I am well enough and eat and work as usual, and get time to write, refrain from writing?
('57', 188, 11, 28, 304809) I don’t mind Vimu’s having had a trip to Yeravda, but has she started working as a scavenger girl?

('57', 189, 10, 11, 305334) October 8, 1932
('57', 189, 11, 12, 305350) PANDITJI, I got your letters.
('57', 189, 11, 13, 305380) Mixed dinner parties with Harijans are not a necessary part of the movement against untouchability, but they are consequence of it.
('57', 189, 11, 14, 305512) I am glad, too, that they take place.
('57', 189, 11, 15, 305550) Though opposition to them is only to be expected, no one will be able to stop them if such dinners have become a popular movement.
('57', 189, 11, 16, 305681) There is no argument whatever based on dharma in support of ideas of pollution through food, etc.
('57', 189, 11, 17, 305779) While we do not encourage image worship in the Ashram, we do not forbid it either.
('57', 189, 11, 18, 305862) Temples in one form or another will always remain as long as Hinduism flourishes.
('57', 189, 11, 19, 305944) Antyajas should have the right to enter all temples recognized as such by the Hindus.
('57', 189, 11, 20, 306030) It cannot be otherwise if we wish to root out the very idea of a certain class of people being Antyajas.
('57', 189, 11, 21, 306135) Hence, not only is there no contradiction of Ashram principles in an Ashram inmate encouraging temple entry, but on the contrary it is his duty to encourage it.
('57', 189, 11, 22, 306296) From a religious standpoint, this issue is very important for the Antyajas.
('57', 189, 11, 23, 306372) It is going to be a test for the Hindus.
('57', 189, 11, 24, 306413) I think it necessary that Ashram inmates should be permitted to go, or should go, to work outside for anti untouchability work.
('57', 189, 11, 25, 306541) All Ashram inmates are intended and trained ultimately to go out to work
('57', 190, 0, 1, 306614) VOL. 57 : 5 SEPTEMBER, 1932 15 NOVEMBER, 1932 191
('57', 190, 1, 2, 306664) among the people.
('57', 190, 1, 3, 306682) No inmate of the Ashram who wishes to worship Ganesh or any other deity should be stopped from doing so.
('57', 190, 2, 4, 306787) However, as an institution we should, in my opinion, remain equal towards all religions and, therefore, should not permit a public temple with an idol in the Ashram.
('57', 190, 2, 5, 306953) Our public temple is the open prayer ground with the horizons in the different directions as its walls, the sky as its roof and formless God as the idol in the temple.
('57', 190, 2, 6, 307121) If we followed any other course, we would be required to provide for a mosque, a fire temple, a church, a synagogue and so on.
('57', 190, 2, 7, 307248) At present the number of Hindus is indeed greater, but we do wish that followers of other faiths also should join us in course of time.
('57', 190, 2, 8, 307384) An attitude of equality towards all religions requires us to keep in view from now the necessity for all such places of worship.
('57', 190, 2, 9, 307513) If we do that, however, we might not be able to keep up our attitude of equality, and therefore, the golden rule for us to follow in this as in other matters is to exercise self control.
('57', 190, 2, 10, 307700) Think over all this carefully and understand it fully, and ask me again and again till you have done so.
('57', 190, 2, 11, 307805) I shall not get tired of answering your questions.
('57', 190, 2, 12, 307856) I have now regained sufficient strength to attend to such duties.
('57', 190, 2, 13, 307922) I have forgotten how Sundarabai and Deshpande came to know each other.
('57', 190, 2, 14, 307993) The religious issue arose because of the previous marriage that was believed to have taken place.
('57', 190, 2, 15, 308091) I only suggested it as an ideal that there should be no marriage between a teacher and his pupil or between one teacher and another working in the same institution.
('57', 190, 2, 16, 308256) There is certainly no religious objection to such marriages.
('57', 190, 2, 17, 308317) If any two persons wish to marry, we may not encourage them but we certainly cannot prevent them.
('57', 190, 2, 18, 308415) I am writing this as a general rule only; I have forgotten what actually happened in this particular case.
('57', 190, 2, 19, 308522) The ideal which I have explained has also not been sufficiently explained to people.
('57', 190, 2, 20, 308607) Nor is any warning given to persons joining the Vidyapith.
('57', 190, 2, 21, 308666) How can we, then, apply the principle in this case?
('57', 190, 2, 22, 308718) In such instances, though sticking to our ideal, we should adopt a liberal attitude.

('57', 191, 2, 3, 309048) October 8, 1932
('57', 191, 3, 4, 309064) MANI, I did get your long letter though it was not long enough for me.
('57', 191, 3, 5, 309135) The fast is now a thing of the past.
('57', 191, 3, 6, 309172) It was inspired by God and so it was crowned with success.
('57', 191, 3, 7, 309231) I am rapidly getting back my normal health.
('57', 191, 3, 8, 309275) I have almost regained my strength.
('57', 191, 3, 9, 309311) Everyday I take two pounds of milk and lots of juice of oranges, pomegranates or grapes, and gourd of tomato soup.
('57', 191, 3, 10, 309426) 1 I can take a fairly good walk, and spin at least 200 rounds of fine yarn, of 45 counts.
('57', 191, 3, 11, 309516) I also write a great many letters.
('57', 191, 3, 12, 309551) So you see there is no cause now for anxiety.
('57', 191, 3, 13, 309597) Ba is permitted to stay with me during the day.
('57', 191, 3, 14, 309645) Davdas also is allowed to come and see me.
('57', 191, 3, 15, 309688) He is all right now.
('57', 191, 3, 16, 309709) Your dreaming about food could be a sign of indigestion, if nothing more.
('57', 191, 3, 17, 309783) Such dreams are common when one is very hungry or suffers from indigestion.
('57', 191, 3, 18, 309859) You should find out the real cause and take the necessary measures, and then stop worrying about the matter.
('57', 191, 3, 19, 309968) If one’s life is regulated by rules of self discipline, such dreams are bound to stop in the course of time.
('57', 191, 3, 20, 310077) We must not expect the veils of ignorance of many lives to vanish all at once; they will take their own time.
('57', 191, 3, 21, 310187) But we need not, for that reason, lose heart or give way to despair or slacken our efforts, and we must entertain no doubt nor worry about the ultimate victory.
('57', 191, 3, 22, 310348) This is the meaning of non attachment taught by the Gita.
('57', 191, 3, 23, 310406) Fasting produces different effects on different persons, and this is not surprising.
('57', 191, 3, 24, 310491) They depend on one’s physical constitution and psychological attitude towards the fast.
('57', 191, 3, 25, 310579) One who is not accustomed to fasting will be upset by the thought of fasting even for one day.
('57', 191, 3, 26, 310674) But fasting is child’s play for one who is in the habit of fasting from time to time.
('57', 191, 3, 27, 310760) Similarly, a person who has not much fat in his system cannot hold out for many days.
('57', 191, 3, 28, 310846) But a fat person, if he is patient, can prolong the fast for a long time and physically benefit by it.
('57', 191, 3, 29, 310949) Father and Mahadev are all right.
('57', 191, 3, 30, 310983) We never enjoyed such solitude before, and it has done us much good.
('57', 191, 3, 31, 311052) I hope you are in good health and so also are Lilavati and Kamaladevi.

('57', 192, 5, 10, 311589) Though you did not get all my letters, it would seem that my blessings sent through others were conveyed to you all right.
('57', 192, 5, 11, 311712) My fast is an old story now.
('57', 192, 5, 12, 311741) I am gradually recovering my strength.
('57', 192, 5, 13, 311780) I take two pounds of milk and the juice of oranges, mosambis, grapes and pomegranates and the soup of tomatoes and gourd.
('57', 192, 5, 14, 311902) I spin daily not less that 200 rounds of 45 counts and write letters too.

('57', 192, 5, 17, 312085) Tell Sarup and Krishna that Mother is here.
('57', 192, 5, 18, 312129) She came and saw me during the fast.
('57', 192, 5, 19, 312166) Chand 1, Tara 2, Indu, etc., also came and saw me.
('57', 192, 5, 20, 312217) Indu seems to be growing well.
('57', 192, 5, 21, 312248) You have given no news about Kanta in your letter.
('57', 192, 5, 22, 312299) If Rani Vidyavati is with you, tell her that I wrote several letters to her.
('57', 192, 5, 23, 312376) Your enthusiasm for study is commendable.
('57', 192, 5, 24, 312418) Read and learn as much as you can while you are there.
('57', 192, 5, 25, 312473) After you are released, we shall make better arrangements.
('57', 192, 5, 26, 312532) Do not be impatient however.
('57', 192, 5, 27, 312561) Your purity, fortitude and devotion to duty represent your real education.
('57', 192, 5, 28, 312636) It is true, of course, that education in letters will add to their lustre, and, therefore, God willing, your desire for it will be fulfilled.

('57', 193, 3, 5, 313076) You have done right in giving up cereals and pulses for some time.
('57', 193, 3, 6, 313143) If you restrict your food to milk and curds, raisins, juice of sour lemon with soda bicarb, oranges, mosambis, cucumber, tomatoes, radishes and salad, your weight will certainly go down.
('57', 193, 3, 7, 313330) Do not eat almonds or other nuts.
('57', 193, 3, 8, 313364) If you wish to chew something, you may eat one ounce of coconut.

('57', 193, 8, 14, 313623) I got both your letters.
('57', 193, 8, 15, 313648) There is nobody now among the prominent leaders who has not blessed my fast.
('57', 193, 8, 16, 313725) There is no doubt that a fast is the ultimate weapon in non violence.
('57', 193, 8, 17, 313795) It is being misused and will probably be misused still more.
('57', 193, 8, 18, 313856) But there is a saving grace even in its misuse.
('57', 193, 8, 19, 313904) It can harm only the person who misuses it.
('57', 193, 8, 20, 313948) And, if we consider the matter deeply, even the harm to him is very small.
('57', 193, 8, 21, 314023) If his motive is pure, his soul will not be sullied, and only the body will be harmed.
('57', 193, 8, 22, 314110) However, not many would come forward even to misuse it.
('57', 193, 8, 23, 314166) How many, after all, would be ready to endure the physical suffering involved in a fast?
('57', 193, 8, 24, 314255) I am regaining strength quite rapidly.
('57', 193, 8, 25, 314294) I take two pounds of milk and plenty of juice of oranges, mosambis, grapes and pome granates.
('57', 193, 8, 26, 314388) I also take soup of gourd or tomato.
('57', 193, 8, 27, 314425) The weight, which had gone down to 93 1/2 lb., has now risen to 99 lb.
('57', 193, 8, 28, 314496) I can walk for a total of an hour and a half daily, and can write a large number of letters.
('57', 193, 8, 29, 314589) I have thus practically regained my original strength.
('57', 193, 8, 30, 314644) I spin at least 200 rounds of nearly 45 counts.
('57', 193, 8, 31, 314692) Nor do I feel much tired afterwards.
('57', 193, 8, 32, 314729) There is, therefore, no cause for the slightest anxiety.

('57', 195, 8, 20, 317136) Well, the whole time the fast was on, I was thinking too of the Hindu Muslim question and asking God to give me light.
('57', 195, 8, 21, 317255) How I wish your, Maulana Abul Kalam’s and Malviyaji’s efforts fructified.
('57', 195, 8, 22, 317329) It would be a grand day if we could achieve not a paper but a heart unity.
('57', 195, 8, 23, 317404) I am glad your wife and sisters are better.
('57', 195, 8, 24, 317448) You too must be well now or you must have a compulsory fast for regaining health.

('57', 196, 6, 11, 318169) But I know that when I have the light, it will pierce through the restrictions.
('57', 196, 6, 12, 318249) Meanwhile I pray though I do not yet fast.
('57', 196, 6, 13, 318292) I hope you were none the worse for the strenuous work in Poona and equally fatiguing long journey.

('57', 196, 11, 20, 318578) MY DEAR URMILA 2 ,
('57', 196, 12, 21, 318597) What a tragedy!
('57', 196, 12, 22, 318613) As you were going out that day, I was about to shout out, when Sarojini said you were all coming back soon.
('57', 196, 12, 23, 318721) And I subsided.
('57', 196, 12, 24, 318737) But so it was to be.
('57', 196, 12, 25, 318758) It was to me a sharp reminder that I was a prisoner and therefore not to have all my way.
('57', 196, 12, 26, 318848) It is a good thing to have these shocks.
('57', 196, 12, 27, 318889) They keep me humble.
('57', 196, 13, 28, 318910) 1 The addressee had asked Gandhiji if in the matter of eradication of untouchability he would agree to a workable compromise.

('57', 197, 1, 3, 319232) I wanted to know all about you and your children.
('57', 197, 1, 4, 319282) Now you must write fully about your joys such as you may have and sorrows that you do have.
('57', 197, 1, 5, 319374) But sorrows of God’s servants are their joys.
('57', 197, 1, 6, 319420) They are the fires through which God tries and purifies them.
('57', 197, 1, 7, 319482) Unmixed joys of this earth will stink in our nostrils and we should die of want of the oxygen of sorrows.
('57', 197, 1, 8, 319588) I have read your letter to Mahadev.
('57', 197, 1, 9, 319624) Let your boy go through the hard mill of difficulties instead of getting a soft job.

('57', 197, 5, 13, 319792) It was fearful not to have met you again.
('57', 197, 5, 14, 319834) As you were going, I do not know whether you noticed that I was casting hungry eyes on you, when Sarojini said you were soon coming back.
('57', 197, 5, 15, 319972) But you were not to.
('57', 197, 5, 16, 319993) What is the meaning of my being a prisoner, if things could happen in the natural course.
('57', 197, 5, 17, 320083) Let us therefore be thankful for the mercies we had.
('57', 197, 5, 18, 320136) I was glad that my fast drew you to Poona.
('57', 197, 5, 19, 320179) I was hungering to see you, since you will not write.
('57', 197, 5, 20, 320233) And now do throw yourself in this glorious work of un touchability.

('57', 197, 10, 24, 320376) Vinoba’s advice is correct, but it does not mean that one should not try physical remedies.
('57', 197, 10, 25, 320468) One should strive for self purification, whatever the condition of one’s health.
('57', 197, 10, 26, 320549) But your constipation ought to be cured by ordinary remedies.
('57', 197, 10, 27, 320611) I am writing to Narandas and suggesting to him that he should let you go to Rajkot or Vijapur.

('57', 198, 6, 8, 321025) NARANDAS, I duly got your mail.
('57', 198, 6, 9, 321057) We must help Bhau to overcome his constipation.
('57', 198, 6, 10, 321105) I feel that, if you send him to Rajkot, the water there may perhaps agree with him.
('57', 198, 6, 11, 321189) If it is impossible to send him to Rajkot, you may send him to Vijapur.
('57', 198, 6, 12, 321261) But I am eager that he should go to Rajkot, as we know that the water of that place agreed with Purushottam.
('57', 198, 6, 13, 321370) Moreover, he will benefit from the company of Purushottam and Jamnadas.
('57', 198, 6, 14, 321442) Do what you think best.
('57', 198, 6, 15, 321466) I feel worried about Kusum.
('57', 198, 6, 16, 321494) The thought that her health does not improve is a painful one.
('57', 198, 6, 17, 321557) Does she take proper rest now?
('57', 198, 6, 18, 321588) Prema told me in her letter that you abstained from many things during my fast.
('57', 198, 6, 19, 321668) I hope that has not affected your health.
('57', 198, 6, 20, 321710) I am regaining my strength with wonderful speed.
('57', 198, 6, 21, 321759) You see how many letters I write.
('57', 198, 6, 22, 321793) I must have written about 30 letters today, important and unimportant.
('57', 198, 6, 23, 321864) As for spinning, I spin at least 200 rounds a day, of more than 45 counts.
('57', 198, 6, 24, 321939) The elbow is in excellent condition, so far.
('57', 198, 6, 25, 321984) I have gone up to two pounds of milk.
('57', 198, 6, 26, 322022) Fruit continues.The weight also has gone up to 99. I can walk for a sufficiently long time.
('57', 198, 6, 27, 322114) You need not, therefore, worry about me at all.
('57', 198, 6, 28, 322162) In which jail is the elder Kusum 1 to be kept?
('57', 198, 6, 29, 322209) Where is she at present?
('57', 198, 6, 30, 322234) After the death at Trivedi’s place, 2 I felt that we should either banish the primus stove from the Ashram or the women should resolve never to light it.
('57', 198, 6, 31, 322388) I enforced this rule today in the case of Ba.
('57', 198, 6, 32, 322434) We have got a primus here at present.
('57', 198, 6, 33, 322472) Ba went to light it.
('57', 198, 6, 34, 322493) I stopped her and Mahadev went instead.

('57', 199, 1, 3, 322762) If the women must use a primus stove, they should ask a man every time to light it.
('57', 199, 1, 4, 322846) Really speaking, it is not at all necessary.
('57', 199, 1, 5, 322891) I hope that Qureshi’s piles have completely disappeared now.
('57', 199, 1, 6, 322952) How is Amina?
('57', 199, 1, 7, 322966) Ask her to write to me.

('57', 199, 1, 9, 323019) Nobody need refrain out of pity for me now.

('57', 200, 7, 21, 325004) You actually mention several virtues of your father.
('57', 200, 7, 22, 325057) It would of course be better if he were free from greed, but you will be able to overcome that weakness in time through loving persuasion.
('57', 200, 7, 23, 325196) You should tolerate it till then.
('57', 200, 7, 24, 325230) Reason with your brothers and sisters.

('57', 200, 7, 28, 325467) But even that you should do after giving him sufficient time to improve.
('57', 200, 7, 29, 325540) We ought not to be self righteous and expect, as soon as we have changed, that the world will change too.
('57', 200, 7, 30, 325646) We may have changed in one respect, but probably we do not see the many other weaknesses which remain in us.

('57', 201, 3, 6, 326129) I know your views of old on caste and untouchability.
('57', 201, 3, 7, 326183) I quite agree with you that caste has got to go.
('57', 201, 3, 8, 326232) But whether it would do so in my generation I do not know.
('57', 201, 3, 9, 326291) Only let us not mix up the two and spoil both causes.
('57', 201, 3, 10, 326345) Untouchability is a soul destroying sin.
('57', 201, 3, 11, 326386) Caste is a social evil.

('57', 201, 8, 18, 326692) You are always punctual in sending me the right message at the right moment.
('57', 201, 8, 19, 326769) You put to shame the youth of the country by your enthusiasm at your time of life.
('57', 201, 8, 20, 326852) May God enable you to finish the century in the same state of vigour.

('57', 201, 11, 23, 326985) October 10, 1932
('57', 201, 12, 24, 327002) You do not seem to have studied my very first statement given to the Press.
('57', 201, 12, 25, 327078) You will find from it that although technically I could express my purpose in the manner I did, the fast was in truth addressed to the Hindus and others who had faith in me.
('57', 201, 12, 26, 327252) You will observe too that the vast mass of Hindus instinctively understood the purpose of the fast.
('57', 201, 12, 27, 327352) I hope this is quite clear.
('57', 201, 12, 28, 327380) The reason why
('57', 201, 13, 29, 327395) 1 The addressee, writing from Ceylon, had asked why Gandhiji was not satisfied by the Pact itself and had made the Government’s acceptance of it a condition for breaking his fast.
('57', 202, 0, 1, 327575) VOL. 57 : 5 SEPTEMBER, 1932 15 NOVEMBER, 1932 203
('57', 202, 1, 2, 327625) Government acceptance was necessary was because the Pact would be useless in the teeth of the adverse decision.
('57', 202, 1, 3, 327737) This was the natural corollary to the Pact and the fast.

('57', 202, 3, 5, 327827) 368. LETTER TO JAMNALAL BAJAJ
('57', 202, 4, 6, 327857) October 10, 1932
('57', 202, 5, 7, 327874) CHI JAMNALAL,
('57', 202, 6, 8, 327888) I had got your letter.
('57', 202, 6, 9, 327911) You may have thought it too long, but I did not feel so, especially as it gave me the news that the ‘begger’ had started on his begging mission.
('57', 202, 6, 10, 328056) Tell him that I had got his letter.
('57', 202, 6, 11, 328092) Since he has relieved me of my worry, I intend this letter for him too.
('57', 202, 6, 12, 328164) My body has almost recovered its normal strength.
('57', 202, 6, 13, 328214) My diet includes milk, oranges, mosambis, grapes or pomegranates, and gourd and tomatoes among vegetables.
('57', 202, 6, 14, 328321) Sometimes I drop milk for a day or two.
('57', 202, 6, 15, 328361) I walk twice a day, for a total of an hour and a half.
('57', 202, 6, 16, 328416) I write a great many letters.
('57', 202, 6, 17, 328446) I spin, as I used to do before the fast, not less than 200 rounds daily, of more than 45 counts.
('57', 202, 6, 18, 328543) This should reassure everyone.
('57', 202, 6, 19, 328574) I suffered much physically during the fast but the mind was compeletely at peace.
('57', 202, 6, 20, 328656) If the fast had had to be prolonged, I would not have felt any strain on the mind.
('57', 202, 6, 21, 328739) But it was for God, at whose prompting I had undertaken the fast, to prolong it or make it short.
('57', 202, 6, 22, 328837) Ba is still permitted to stay with me for the whole day.
('57', 202, 6, 23, 328894) But that will probably stop now.
('57', 202, 6, 24, 328927) Devdas can come and see me for some time.
('57', 202, 6, 25, 328969) However he does not come every day.
('57', 202, 6, 26, 329005) Sardar and Mahadev continue to be with me.
('57', 202, 6, 27, 329048) Your health can be considered all right.
('57', 202, 6, 28, 329089) If you have lost some weight, that is to the good.
('57', 202, 6, 29, 329140) But you should not lose any more now.
('57', 202, 6, 30, 329178) Vinoba’s company has undoubtedly benefited you in that it has strengthened your faith in God.
('57', 202, 6, 31, 329272) He has a beautiful way with him indeed.
('57', 202, 6, 32, 329312) It is also good that you have had Gulzarilal’s company.
('57', 202, 6, 33, 329368) It is good, too, that you have come to have faith in nature cure methods and simple food.
('57', 202, 6, 34, 329458) These two save us from many diseases.
('57', 202, 6, 35, 329496) Your daily programme is excellent.
('57', 202, 6, 36, 329531) You should be happy that you are a ‘C’ class prisoner.
('57', 202, 6, 37, 329586) Personally, I have always disliked being in ‘A’ or ‘ B’ class.
('57', 202, 6, 38, 329649) Even in ‘C’ class one can secure the facilities necessary to preserve one’s health.
('57', 202, 6, 39, 329733) Has Gulzarilal become sufficiently strong now?
('57', 202, 6, 40, 329780) Is Madhavji all right?
('57', 202, 6, 41, 329803) Sardar had acquired great speed in his study of Sanskrit, but owing to the fast it has slowed down a little.
('57', 202, 6, 42, 329912) He is now
('57', 203, 0, 1, 329922) 204 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 203, 1, 2, 329964) preparing to resume the former speed.
('57', 203, 1, 3, 330002) So far our daily routine has been quite satisfactory.
('57', 203, 1, 4, 330056) We eat and sleep, read newspapers, pace up and down for a walk, read and study what we wish to and spin.
('57', 203, 1, 5, 330161) Carding is Mahadev’s monopoly.
('57', 203, 1, 6, 330192) But he has suspended that work for some time, for a fairly good stock of slivers has accumulated.
('57', 203, 1, 7, 330290) Moreover, Chhakkaddas also has been sending fine slivers.
('57', 203, 1, 8, 330348) I get letters from Wardha regularly.
('57', 203, 1, 9, 330385) Give regards from us all to everyone there.

('57', 203, 5, 13, 330529) October 10, 1932
('57', 203, 6, 14, 330546) BHAI DADACHANJI , This is in reply to your letter of the 23rd.
('57', 203, 6, 15, 330609) I wish to clarify my position in regard to Baba 1. I find it very difficult to believe that one person can help another to see God.
('57', 203, 6, 16, 330741) My heart refuses to accept this idea.
('57', 203, 6, 17, 330779) When Baba, however, makes such a claim, I can only tell him that I would welcome his help if he could make me see God.
('57', 203, 6, 18, 330898) We need not believe that a person has necessarily seen God just because he says that he has seen Him.
('57', 203, 6, 19, 331000) Many persons who make such a claim are found to be suffering from a delusion.
('57', 203, 6, 20, 331078) In many cases the claim is merely an echo of one’s own wishes.
('57', 203, 6, 21, 331141) I certainly do not believe that seeing God means seeing some Power outside of us, for I believe that He dwells in the hearts of us all.
('57', 203, 6, 22, 331277) But only one in thousands knows Him through the heart.
('57', 203, 6, 23, 331332) It is not enough to know God with one’s intellect.
('57', 203, 6, 24, 331383) I do feel that no person can help another to see God in this sense.
('57', 203, 6, 25, 331451) One cannot fast at the instance of somebody else in order to be able to see God.
('57', 203, 6, 26, 331532) I would do so only when I feel an urge from within me.
('57', 203, 6, 27, 331587) And when there is such an urge, I will not let myself be dissuaded from the step by anybody.
('57', 203, 6, 28, 331680) There is absolutely no reason for assuming that fasting would help me to see God.
('57', 203, 6, 29, 331762) I cannot believe that, if I agree to fast for forty days, Baba can help me to see God.
('57', 203, 6, 30, 331849) That would be an easy bargain.
('57', 203, 6, 31, 331880) If one can see God as easily as that, the experience has no value for me.

('57', 204, 0, 1, 331967) VOL. 57 : 5 SEPTEMBER, 1932 15 NOVEMBER, 1932 205
('57', 204, 1, 2, 332017) I thought that Baba did not divide life into separate fields.
('57', 204, 1, 3, 332079) To a person whose life is dedicated to dharma, politics, economics, etc., are all aspects of dharma, and he cannot leave out any of them.
('57', 204, 1, 4, 332217) According to me, a person who regards dharma as one of the many activities of life does not know what dharma is.
('57', 204, 1, 5, 332330) It is, therefore, inconceivable to me that I might some day give up politics, social reform and other similar activities.
('57', 204, 1, 6, 332452) I have entered the fields of politics, social service, etc., for the sake of dharma.
('57', 204, 1, 7, 332537) I did not promise to translate Baba’s writings into Gujarati.
('57', 204, 1, 8, 332599) On the contrary, I suggested to Baba that he should come out of the spell of English and not write or get somebody to write for him in English, but write and explain his ideas in Gujarati, his mother tongue, or in Persian which as he says, he knows very well.
('57', 204, 1, 9, 332859) Yes, I would certainly translate into Gujarati any of his writings which deeply appeal to me.
('57', 204, 1, 10, 332953) In short, I am a student of Baba’s ideas.
('57', 204, 1, 11, 332995) I saw Baba, having received a wire from Jamshed Mehta whom I regard as a pure soul.
('57', 204, 1, 12, 333079) I am always in search of bhaktas of God and, thinking that Baba was one, I met him.

('57', 205, 5, 10, 334013) You should either banish the primus stove from your home or, if that is not possible, the women members should take a vow never to light it themselves.
('57', 205, 5, 11, 334165) They should always ask a man to light it for them.
('57', 205, 5, 12, 334216) The dress of our women is not designed to enable them to light a primus stove.

('57', 205, 9, 18, 334557) I commend the efforts to help child widows to marry again.
('57', 205, 9, 19, 334616) These tasks can be undertaken by men of self control and pure character.

('57', 206, 3, 4, 334927) BELOVED DAUGHTER RAIHANA, You are a very clever girl.
('57', 206, 3, 5, 334981) You want me to fast again in order that you may send me bhajans composed by you.
('57', 206, 3, 6, 335062) No, I will not fast.
('57', 206, 3, 7, 335083) And the bhajan will please me only when you sing it to me.
('57', 206, 3, 8, 335142) If I had not heard you sing the bhajan “Arise and Awake, O Traveller”, it would not have touched me so deeply.
('57', 206, 3, 9, 335253) Even if you sing this bhajan from outside the jail walls, your voice will reach me.
('57', 206, 3, 10, 335337) I do hear, for instance, the sound of all of you dancing.
('57', 206, 3, 11, 335395) Greetings to Father and Mother from us all.
('57', 206, 3, 12, 335439) And a slap for you.

('57', 206, 8, 22, 335792) I suppose you must have got my letter today.
('57', 206, 8, 23, 335837) I am writing this letter to tell you about Hari ichchha.
('57', 206, 8, 24, 335894) I forgot to write about her earlier today.
('57', 206, 8, 25, 335937) She is Valjibhai’s niece.
('57', 206, 8, 26, 335963) She lived in the Ashram for some years and has now married Engineer Kamdar of Baroda.
('57', 206, 8, 27, 336049) I had been writing to her and asking her to go and see you.
('57', 206, 8, 28, 336109) But since I had not written to you about her, you could not recognize her when she called on you.
('57', 206, 8, 29, 336207) The fault was mine and not yours.
('57', 206, 8, 30, 336241) Hari ichchha informs me that you did not make her feel in any way that she was a stranger, and that both Mother and you showed her great love.
('57', 206, 8, 31, 336384) The other one was Shanta, who still lives in the Ashram.

('57', 207, 3, 6, 336746) It would have been better if I had prepared her.
('57', 207, 3, 7, 336795) I have now written 1 to her today.
('57', 207, 3, 8, 336830) But the truth is that she does not require anybody to be introduced to her.

('57', 207, 7, 14, 337192) For people like me removal of untouchability is solely a matter of faith.
('57', 207, 7, 15, 337266) I would never attempt to give up my life on a political issue.
('57', 207, 7, 16, 337329) Yes, I agree that no coercion should be used whether in a religious or any other matter.
('57', 207, 7, 17, 337418) As far as I can judge from here there is no coercion in the current activities and God is behind them.
('57', 207, 7, 18, 337521) I firmly hold that there is no religion in observing untouchability.
('57', 207, 7, 19, 337590) What more shall I write?
('57', 207, 7, 20, 337615) I hope I shall continue to enjoy your love.

('57', 208, 3, 4, 337829) BHAI KRISHNACHANDRA, Your letter reached me only today.
('57', 208, 3, 5, 337885) Destiny is certainly there but so is effort too.
('57', 208, 3, 6, 337934) Destiny simply means that in the absence of effort we have only the fruits of the actions of our past lives.
('57', 208, 3, 7, 338043) Effort can change destiny.
('57', 208, 3, 8, 338070) Therefore brahmacharya is necessary for those who wish to realize the Brahman.
('57', 208, 3, 9, 338149) See the fifteenth chapter 1 of the Gita.
('57', 208, 3, 10, 338190) Anyway brahmacharya is the essence of the Gita.
('57', 208, 3, 11, 338238) One who wants to lose himself in the Brahman, one who wants to be ever immersed in service has no time for sensual pleasures.

('57', 208, 8, 16, 338475) October 10, 1932 I have your letter.
('57', 208, 8, 17, 338512) Here is my message: I am growing stronger in my belief that cow protection is an impossibility until we carefully study its economics, take into our fold the untouchables who can do immense service in this work until all the dairies are run on scientific lines and we take a vow to use the hide of dead animals only.
('57', 208, 8, 18, 338829) Thus the duty now of workers for cow protection is to understand well these significant points, act accordingly as far as possible and induce others to do so.

('57', 209, 2, 4, 339204) I quite agree with you that milk of cows and buffaloes should be avoided for the reasons given by you.
('57', 209, 2, 5, 339307) I do not take this milk.
('57', 209, 2, 6, 339332) But I do take goat’s milk, though I consider that too objectionable on more general grounds.
('57', 209, 2, 7, 339425) I have been trying to find an effective substitute for it, but have so far failed.
('57', 209, 2, 8, 339508) I did not break my fast on honey, but on orange juice.
('57', 209, 2, 9, 339563) But I do take honey and I do not consider it objectionable.
('57', 209, 2, 10, 339623) If honey is obtained in a scientific manner not a bee need be destroyed or starved.
('57', 209, 2, 11, 339707) But I confess to you that I do not always get such innocent honey.

('57', 209, 6, 18, 340012) But how can you get compliments if, in your joy for having won a medal, you fall ill?
('57', 209, 6, 19, 340098) Get well if you wish to have my compliments.
('57', 209, 6, 20, 340143) Who presented the medal to you?

('57', 210, 3, 4, 340666) SUSHILA, What a strange person you are!
('57', 210, 3, 5, 340706) You fell ill as soon as you landed at Bombay.
('57', 210, 3, 6, 340752) May I take this to mean that I should send you back to South Africa immediately?
('57', 210, 3, 7, 340833) Earlier, Manilal came in hot haste and took you away.
('57', 210, 3, 8, 340887) This time, too, you two seem to have come with some such conspiracy.
('57', 210, 3, 9, 340956) That is why, I suppose, Sita refused to come here without you.
('57', 210, 3, 10, 341019) She was afraid that you might go away without her.
('57', 210, 3, 11, 341070) I hope you are improving now.
('57', 210, 3, 12, 341100) Ba will come to see you.

('57', 211, 2, 3, 341913) October 11, 1932 Eradication of untouchability means that we should treat Antyajas as we treat members of the other communities.
('57', 211, 2, 4, 342042) That is, we should not object to their physical touch or to drinking water served by them, and they may enter our homes or public temples and attend schools like other Hindus.
('57', 211, 2, 5, 342218) This much is necessarily implied in it.
('57', 211, 2, 6, 342258) Whether one should eat food cooked by them or eat in their company or intermarry with them is a matter of one’s own choice.
('57', 211, 2, 7, 342382) Religion does not forbid that, nor does it enjoin it.
('57', 211, 2, 8, 342436) The mixed dinner parties which are often arranged these days are not a necessary part of the movement.
('57', 211, 2, 9, 342539) But I have no doubt that they deserve to be commended.

('57', 211, 5, 14, 342696) The Congress workers who left the meeting because drinking water was fetched by untouchables acted most imporperly.
('57', 211, 5, 15, 342812) Drinking of water offered by untouchables is an intergral part of the eradication of untouchability.
('57', 211, 5, 16, 342913) Our dharma is to treat the untouchables the same way we treat other communities.
('57', 211, 5, 17, 342994) Those who have done “expiation” have committed a sin and acted against the Congress.
('57', 211, 5, 18, 343079) Your being boycotted is immoral and you must on no account undergo expiation.
('57', 211, 5, 19, 343157) I am distressed that some of our brothers at Bilaspur by their immoral conduct have created a misunderstanding in the minds of the untouchables.
('57', 211, 5, 20, 343302) I want them to make a public acknowledgement of their mistake.
('57', 211, 5, 21, 343365) I am in favour of inter dining and intermarriage but I do not
('57', 211, 6, 22, 343427) 1 The source says the addressee was a Marwari gentleman of Nagpur.
('57', 211, 6, 23, 343494) 2 The addressee, not identified by name in the source, had given a distressing account of a meeting held at Bilaspur in connection with Gandhiji’s fast.
('57', 211, 6, 24, 343647) On some people accepting water from Chamars, it seemed, protests were raised.
('57', 211, 6, 25, 343725) Some were forced to go through purificatory rites and others who had refused to do so were being thratened with excommunication.
('57', 211, 6, 26, 343854) The correspondent had asked whether this was right.

('57', 212, 1, 2, 343956) consider them a necessary feature of removal of untouchability.
('57', 212, 1, 3, 344020) I feel that those who consider it a dharma to practise these deserve to be applauded.
('57', 212, 1, 4, 344106) The mixed public dinners that are arranged these days are in my opinion a good thing.
('57', 212, 1, 5, 344192) I have not noticed any injunction against inter dining and intermarriage in the scriptures.

('57', 212, 5, 12, 344469) DEAR DAUGHTER AMTUSSALAAM, Today I will not write in Urdu.
('57', 212, 6, 13, 344528) You do deserve shabash 2 for curing yourself quickly.
('57', 212, 6, 14, 344582) You will get well quicker if you won’t worry about meeting me.
('57', 212, 6, 15, 344645) When God wills it, we shall meet.
('57', 212, 6, 16, 344679) Meanwhile let us be thankful that we can write to each other.
('57', 212, 6, 17, 344741) Yes, I will write to the other girls about the baths.

('57', 212, 6, 19, 344866) She will, if she keeps good health.
('57', 212, 6, 20, 344902) As for your womb it must not be removed unless it is diseased.
('57', 212, 6, 21, 344965) For that you should consult Mrs. Lazarus and do as she advises.
('57', 212, 6, 22, 345029) There should be no hurry about this operation.
('57', 212, 6, 23, 345076) Operations are not always a sure cure.
('57', 212, 6, 24, 345115) Natural treatment is the most efficacious in the long run and never harmful.
('57', 212, 6, 25, 345192) Operations have often been harmful and at times even proved fatal.

('57', 213, 3, 4, 345417) MIRA, Your weekly letter was received today.
('57', 213, 3, 5, 345462) I am glad the weather there has improved and that you are feeling better.
('57', 213, 3, 6, 345536) You do not tell me whether you have commenced your studies in earnest.
('57', 213, 3, 7, 345607) If your health does not permit, I do not want to goad you to them.
('57', 213, 3, 8, 345674) My question is, therefore, merely out of curiosity.
('57', 213, 3, 9, 345726) It has been your won’t to report your progress in your studies.
('57', 213, 3, 10, 345790) Though my weight shows no increase my general condition is decidedly better.
('57', 213, 3, 11, 345867) I was walking with the aid of a stick.
('57', 213, 3, 12, 345906) I gave it up two days ago.
('57', 213, 3, 13, 345933) The feel is better in every way.
('57', 213, 3, 14, 345966) Yes, Ba has been attending to my feed.
('57', 213, 3, 15, 346005) It is still largely fruit.
('57', 213, 3, 16, 346032) But that means much time and labour as you know to your cost and joy.
('57', 213, 3, 17, 346102) The proportion is about the same.
('57', 213, 3, 18, 346136) Manilal and Sushila have arrived.

('57', 213, 3, 22, 346298) I think I did tell you that he had that deadly fever through which Natal passed a few months ago.
('57', 213, 3, 23, 346396) But he has seen me.
('57', 213, 3, 24, 346416) He has brought many good apples from South Africa and oranges from Zanzibar.
('57', 213, 3, 25, 346493) I wish you could share them.
('57', 213, 3, 26, 346522) It is no use my attempting to send them there.

('57', 214, 9, 20, 348261) In any case, they should not give trouble to others.
('57', 214, 9, 21, 348314) I am told that these days you play all the time and also harass people.
('57', 214, 9, 22, 348386) Is this true?

('57', 215, 14, 28, 349695) Do, cheerfully and with faith, as Narandas advises, or live alone independently.
('57', 215, 14, 29, 349776) If you think you cannot possibly do that go to the Ashram.

('57', 216, 1, 3, 350124) If, however, you are determinded to work in the city, you should stay in the city.
('57', 216, 1, 4, 350207) You are not strong enough to go to the city and return on bicycle.
('57', 216, 1, 5, 350274) I think it would be a risky thing to do.
('57', 216, 1, 6, 350315) Give up the desire to ride two horses at the same time.
('57', 216, 1, 7, 350371) You should not become an obstacle in the attempt being made in the Ashram to do without outside labour as far as possible.

('57', 218, 6, 13, 353516) The removal of untouchability does not necessarily include inter dining or intermarriage, but it is open to anyone to dine or marry among Harijans.
('57', 218, 6, 14, 353664) In other words, Harijans should have the same status as the rest of the Hindus in all matters.
('57', 218, 6, 15, 353759) Inter dining does not mean eating out of the same plate.

('57', 219, 6, 10, 355069) For that, however, you should learn to regard every moment as having value.
('57', 219, 6, 11, 355145) You will learn that in time.
('57', 219, 6, 12, 355174) Service of Antyajas is certainly a great cause, but it should not get priority over your former vow.

('57', 220, 3, 5, 355762) Only I cannot give you the full reply it deserves.
('57', 220, 3, 6, 355813) My position as a prisoner would not warrant my giving you a detailed reply.
('57', 220, 3, 7, 355889) One thing I may say.
('57', 220, 3, 8, 355910) I do not isolate politics from religion as you appear to me to do.
('57', 220, 3, 9, 355977) Religion to be true must pervade every activity of life.
('57', 220, 3, 10, 356034) And that activity which cannot be pursued without sacrificing religion is an immoral activity to be shunned at all costs.
('57', 220, 3, 11, 356156) Politics is not only not such an activity but it is an integral part of civic life.
('57', 220, 3, 12, 356240) The rest of the discussion must be postponed to more auspicious occasion.
('57', 220, 3, 13, 356314) Only do not give me up in despair.

('57', 220, 6, 17, 356494) MAHALAKSHMI, The purpose behind bangles, the vermilion mark, and the coloured sari might be adornment or conformity to custom, just as one might eat for pleasure or only to give the body its hire.
('57', 220, 6, 18, 356691) One ought to give up eating for the sake of pleasure, but may give the body anything it needs, even if it be something which one enjoys eating.
('57', 220, 6, 19, 356835) Milk and curds taken with dates give us no little pleasure.
('57', 220, 6, 20, 356895) But you eat them, since you have not adopted that diet for the pleasure of the palate.
('57', 220, 6, 21, 356982) In the same way, you should give up bangles, the vermilion mark and coloured sari despite opposition from society, if they arouse passion in you, but it is not blameworthy to retain them if you do so merely in obedience to custom or to respect the wishes of the elders.
('57', 220, 6, 22, 357252) In other words, there is no absolute duty not to retain them, as there is the absolute duty of not telling a lie.
('57', 220, 6, 23, 357366) It was for such a reason that I

('57', 221, 1, 2, 357876) said in my letter that the error was in taking a vow not to wear bangles.
('57', 221, 1, 3, 357950) It is not proper to take a sudden vow for something which is not an absolute duty.
('57', 221, 1, 4, 358033) There is no great self sacrifice in such a step.
('57', 221, 1, 5, 358082) It would have been right for you to take that vow if you had been pining for bangles, travelling all over the world to get bangles of your choice or were in the habit of stealing them.
('57', 221, 1, 6, 358267) I know women who want to have bangles of various styles, fight with their husbands to get them or steal them.
('57', 221, 1, 7, 358377) It would be good for such women to take a vow not to wear bangles, but they would fight with me if I so much as made such a suggestion.
('57', 221, 1, 8, 358513) A woman who thinks that all her beauty lies in her hair would get red with anger at the mere suggestion that she should cut off her hair.
('57', 221, 1, 9, 358651) She might get it cut off, but it is not wrong for a woman, who dislikes long hair and thinks it to be a burden, to keep her hair long to please her parents or to avoid being cut off from society.
('57', 221, 1, 10, 358847) Do you now understand this shastra of bangle wearing?
('57', 221, 1, 11, 358901) Now about the children.
('57', 221, 1, 12, 358925) The problem is similar to that of the bangles.
('57', 221, 1, 13, 358972) Suppose the children do not feel at home in the Ashram without you, and suppose that there is no other place where they may be kept; then it will be your duty to stay for sometime with them in the Ashram.
('57', 221, 1, 14, 359177) This cannot be described as “living”in the Ashram.
('57', 221, 1, 15, 359228) Just as it is not wrong for a person who is very ill to take rest from work for a time, similarly it is not wrong to spend a fortnight or a month in the Ashram for the sake of the children, that might even be one’s dharma.
('57', 221, 1, 16, 359451) Such matters require careful thinking.
('57', 221, 1, 17, 359490) That is why the Gita says that it is not easy to distinguish between what is right action, what is wrong action and what is inaction.
('57', 221, 1, 18, 359624) If, therefore, you are convinced that it is difficult to keep the children at Calcutta and that it is your duty to put them in the Ashram, you should spend, on my responsibility and above all for their sake, one month with them in the Ashram after their arrival and accustom them to the life there.
('57', 221, 1, 19, 359923) Even during that period, if some urgent work requires you to leave you may certainly go, and Narandas will look after the children as best he can.
('57', 221, 1, 20, 360070) Wouldn't he have to look after them if you were to die and there was nobody at Calcutta?
('57', 221, 1, 21, 360159) However, let the children remain where they are if this arrangement does not suit you or the children refuse to go or the elders are likely to feel very much hurt.
('57', 221, 1, 22, 360323) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] Do ask me if you still have any doubts.

('57', 222, 2, 3, 360514) October 14, 1932 Tell Durgabai Joag that the women can get rid of the fear which they feel in going about their work through firmness of mind.
('57', 222, 2, 4, 360657) They should go freely wherever necessary for work or service with a firm conviction that God is there to protect them.
('57', 222, 2, 5, 360776) Whom do they fear?
('57', 222, 2, 6, 360795) Why should they fear any men?
('57', 222, 2, 7, 360825) Why think that all men are only waiting for an opportunity to harass women?
('57', 222, 2, 8, 360901) After all, men are born of women and the latter ought to have the faith that no man would ordinarily attack a woman who is like a mother to him.
('57', 222, 2, 9, 361046) Every woman should regard herself as a mother and fear a man only if she would fear her own son.
('57', 222, 2, 10, 361143) If, nevertheless, a woman meets a man who is blinded by lust, she should remain firm in her conviction that the armour of her purity will protect her.

('57', 223, 7, 13, 362580) October 15, 1932 I should have written earlier but the authorities were considering whether such correspondence should be allowed.
('57', 223, 7, 14, 362711) They had held up my telegram to the Zamorin which I had handed in the same day as I had sent the one to you, i.e., 3rd instant.
('57', 223, 7, 15, 362839) It has now been sent.
('57', 223, 7, 16, 362861) I enclose copy herewith.
('57', 223, 7, 17, 362886) You will see therefore that I began work immediately.
('57', 223, 7, 18, 362940) You will move there gently and courteously.
('57', 223, 7, 19, 362984) There should be no threats and no loud claims made.
('57', 223, 7, 20, 363036) The real thing is conversion even of the most orthodox.
('57', 223, 7, 21, 363092) Please keep me regularly informed of the progress of the movement.

('57', 224, 3, 6, 363496) I hope you duly received it.
('57', 224, 3, 7, 363525) I trust that you will please move in the matter and ensure the opening of the temple during the period of suspenssion.

('57', 224, 7, 13, 363889) DEAR BOYS AND GIRLS, I got your letter after a long interval.
('57', 224, 7, 14, 363951) All those who were ill must have recovered now.
('57', 224, 7, 15, 363999) All I have to say for the New Year 2 is that you should under stand the meaning of the vows better and become more thoughtful and vigilant about them.
('57', 224, 7, 16, 364150) Both the soul and the body will benefit in proportion as you observe the vows willingly.
('57', 224, 7, 17, 364239) It was very good that once the girls by themselves did the cooking.
('57', 224, 7, 18, 364307) And, moreover, there were only five items for eating, so that, if I had been there, I too would have got an opportunity to eat food cooked by them.
('57', 224, 7, 19, 364455) But I forgot.
('57', 224, 7, 20, 364469) How can I come there in the immediate future?
('57', 224, 7, 21, 364515) God willing, I shall some day eat the food cooked by the pure hands of the girls there.

('57', 225, 3, 5, 364943) If that is not your full address, you should not give only that in a letter.
('57', 225, 3, 6, 365020) Always write your full address in your letters.
('57', 225, 3, 7, 365068) It is good news that you are well again; I have nearly regained my strength.
('57', 225, 3, 8, 365145) It is desirable that the weight should increase slowly.
('57', 225, 3, 9, 365201) Till yesterday Ba used to come daily to attend on me.
('57', 225, 3, 10, 365255) Now that I do not need her help, we both decided that she should stop coming.
('57', 225, 3, 11, 365333) She must have gone to Bombay today.

('57', 225, 3, 13, 365412) There has been no great improvement in her health, but it seems that the improvement which had taken place at Deolali has been kept up.

('57', 225, 8, 18, 365741) NARANDAS,
('57', 225, 9, 19, 365751) I duly got your mail.
('57', 225, 9, 20, 365773) Champa seems to be seriously ill.
('57', 225, 9, 21, 365807) I had a direct letter from her.
('57', 225, 9, 22, 365839) She asks me in it what she should do if her expenses go up because of illness or some other reason.
('57', 225, 9, 23, 365939) Read my reply to her.
('57', 225, 9, 24, 365961) Please reassure her.
('57', 225, 9, 25, 365982) If she spends more sometimes, let her do so.
('57', 225, 9, 26, 366027) Do you draw the money for her from Bombay or from Rangoon?
('57', 225, 9, 27, 366086) I guess from yourletter that Champa’s illness has improved Ratilal’s temper.
('57', 225, 9, 28, 366163) This is certainly good news.
('57', 225, 10, 29, 366192) 1 From the postmark 2 Vide “Letter to Rukminidevi Bazaj”.11 10 1932. 3 Addressee’s sister
('57', 226, 0, 1, 366282) VOL. 57 : 5 SEPTEMBER, 1932 15 NOVEMBER, 1932 227
('57', 226, 1, 2, 366332) 4.15 a.m., October 16, 1932 Panditji had asked me where the inmates of the Ashram may work to make their contribution towards removal of untouchability, and what work they should do.
('57', 226, 1, 3, 366515) I had replied to him.
('57', 226, 1, 4, 366537) Still, I will say something more here.
('57', 226, 1, 5, 366576) One of the aims of the Ashram is that the persons trained in it should afterwards spread out in villages and start doing work in them.
('57', 226, 1, 6, 366711) The work will of course be connected with khadi, removal of untouchability, etc.
('57', 226, 1, 7, 366792) But they should also take advantage of the prevailing atmosphere at any time and pay more attention to that particular activity.
('57', 226, 1, 8, 366921) If, therefore, we can do any work in the surro unding villages for removal of untouchability, we should certainly do it.
('57', 226, 1, 9, 367042) We should, if possible, work even in cities.
('57', 226, 1, 10, 367087) There is a temple on one side of the Ashram.
('57', 226, 1, 11, 367132) There is one opposite to the Ashram, too.
('57', 226, 1, 12, 367174) See if you can get them thrown open to Antyajas.
('57', 226, 1, 13, 367223) We may acquaint ourselves with their conditions.
('57', 226, 1, 14, 367272) If we can accommodate them, we should invite more Antyajas families to come and live in the Ashram.
('57', 226, 1, 15, 367372) Vinoba’s scheme is certainly excellent.
('57', 226, 1, 16, 367412) If we can implement it, we should try to do so.
('57', 226, 1, 17, 367460) These are only a few isolated suggestions for guidance.
('57', 226, 1, 18, 367516) What is essential is that each one of us should take up whatever work he can think of and do his best.
('57', 226, 1, 19, 367619) We should become one with the work as sugar becomes one with milk, and still remains detached.
('57', 226, 1, 20, 367714) We should never think that some work was done by the Ashram or by an inmate of the Ashram.
('57', 226, 1, 21, 367805) We should feel that we do everything as instruments in God’s hands and act in that spirit.
('57', 226, 1, 22, 367896) These suggestions do not—ought not to—interfere with other vows which we may have taken.
('57', 226, 1, 23, 367985) They should remain undisturbed.
('57', 226, 1, 24, 368017) Everybody should go on working in accordance with his vow and, in addition, participate in the present movement against untouchability as much as he can.
('57', 226, 1, 25, 368171) If such work is not compatible with one’s vow, the path is clear.
('57', 226, 1, 26, 368237) However noble another’s dharma may be, one’s good lies in one’s own dharma.
('57', 226, 1, 27, 368313) Whether we live or die doing that dharma is the same for us, that is, we shall advance spiritually in either case.
('57', 226, 1, 28, 368428) Who had placed Punjabhai in such a chair that he fell down?
('57', 226, 1, 29, 368488) Anybody who gets fainting fits should have a seat which would not overturn.
('57', 226, 1, 30, 368564) But this is wisdom after the event.
('57', 226, 1, 31, 368600) However, don’t we all advance by learning from one’s own or other people’s mistakes to avoid similar mistakes in future?
('57', 226, 1, 32, 368721) We need not be perturbed by the death of Trivedi’s brother’s wife, Taragouri.
('57', 226, 1, 33, 368799) Her death was ordained.
('57', 226, 1, 34, 368823) In her case the stove has been only instrumental.
('57', 226, 1, 35, 368873) And, moreover, she could not get immediate help.
('57', 226, 1, 36, 368922) Taragouri also got frightened and could not loosen
('57', 227, 0, 1, 368973) 228 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 227, 1, 2, 369015) the knot of her skirt.
('57', 227, 1, 3, 369038) Her attempt to loosen it resulted in a further knot.
('57', 227, 1, 4, 369091) All these were preordained.
('57', 227, 1, 5, 369119) We ever live besieged by Death.
('57', 227, 1, 6, 369151) Nobody knows from which side and when he will attack.
('57', 227, 1, 7, 369205) We should draw only one lesson from such a death.
('57', 227, 1, 8, 369255) What we can do today, we should not leave for tomorrow, and what we can do this minute we should not leave to the next.
('57', 227, 1, 9, 369375) Apart from that, we should overcome our love of the primus stove, and everybody should also learn what to do when his or her clothes accidentally catch fire.
('57', 227, 1, 10, 369533) The leather for repairing sandal soles received this time seems to be excellent.
('57', 227, 1, 11, 369614) If you had not sent the pair of sandals, I could have done without it, for I have already three pairs with me.
('57', 227, 1, 12, 369725) Their upper sides are in quite good condition.
('57', 227, 1, 13, 369772) But the soles of all three of them are worn out.
('57', 227, 1, 14, 369821) I will now get them repaired, so that they will become as good as new.
('57', 227, 1, 15, 369892) The pair which you have sent will then be the fourth.
('57', 227, 1, 16, 369946) But never mind.
('57', 227, 1, 17, 369962) Instead of your having to keep it safe there, we will keep it safe here.
('57', 227, 1, 18, 370035) Think a little more about Kusum.
('57', 227, 1, 19, 370068) Can you arrange to send her to Almora?
('57', 227, 1, 20, 370107) The whole family seems to be infected with the disease.
('57', 227, 1, 21, 370163) Navin clearly exhibits signs of tuberculosis.
('57', 227, 1, 22, 370209) Dhiru also seems to me going in the same direction.
('57', 227, 1, 23, 370261) And Kusum does not improve at all.
('57', 227, 1, 24, 370296) The condition of Manjula’s ear is only a symptom.
('57', 227, 1, 25, 370346) The real disease seems to be the same as in the case of the others.
('57', 227, 1, 26, 370414) However, all the four may possibly recover, provided strict measures are taken immediately, Change of air may perhaps be the chief among them.
('57', 227, 1, 27, 370557) Navin and Dhiru are still strong enough to be able to look after themselves.
('57', 227, 1, 28, 370634) Apart from their health, they have had sufficient experience to be able to manage things.
('57', 227, 1, 29, 370724) If they have the requisite spirit of service in them so that they would willingly look after Kusum, if there is sufficient space in the room, if they are eager to go, and if Prabhudas is ready to have them, and if you think that they can go, only then should you go ahead with this plan.
('57', 227, 1, 30, 371012) Otherwise you should forget it.
('57', 227, 1, 31, 371044) But 1 this is for people who are passionately eager to live.
('57', 227, 1, 32, 371105) The royal road was shown by Gangadevi.
('57', 227, 1, 33, 371144) If they can keep alive rema ining in the Ashram, they should try to do so.
('57', 227, 1, 34, 371219) If they cannot, they should realize that life is always accompanied by death.
('57', 227, 1, 35, 371297) I would advise them to resolve to stay in the Ashram, to live in the open air all the twenty four hours of the day and do what work they can without

('57', 228, 1, 3, 371692) and thus pass their time.
('57', 228, 1, 4, 371718) If they live thus with cheerful minds, they may even get all right.
('57', 228, 1, 5, 371786) First you should think over all this.
('57', 228, 1, 6, 371824) You may then discuss the matter with them if you think it proper to do so.
('57', 228, 1, 7, 371899) If you think it inadvisable to discuss this just now, forget the suggestion.
('57', 228, 1, 8, 371976) I have received a copy of Madan’s book about fasting.
('57', 228, 1, 9, 372030) Most probably you have got a copy in the Ashram.
('57', 228, 1, 10, 372079) If you do not have it, I will send the one which I have received.
('57', 228, 1, 11, 372145) You may go through it.
('57', 228, 1, 12, 372168) Bhau at any rate should reflect over it.
('57', 228, 1, 13, 372209) It is not at all necessary to get Keshu’s machine patented.
('57', 228, 1, 14, 372269) Nobody is likely to compete with him.
('57', 228, 1, 15, 372307) And if anybody tries, we need not mind.
('57', 228, 1, 16, 372347) We cannot take out a patent.
('57', 228, 1, 17, 372376) This is how I feel just now.
('57', 228, 1, 18, 372405) I write to Godse 1 from time to time.
('57', 228, 1, 19, 372443) I had completely followed the method of making bread.
('57', 228, 1, 20, 372497) The method used here is easier.
('57', 228, 1, 21, 372529) As the fast intervened, I could not send a description of it.
('57', 228, 1, 22, 372591) I will do so now.
('57', 228, 1, 23, 372609) Try this method there.

('57', 228, 7, 32, 373060) Lilavati’s problem is rather difficult.
('57', 228, 7, 33, 373100) Since she has faith in you, it is possible that you will be able to do something about her.
('57', 228, 7, 34, 373192) She is a simple hearted woman and her motives are good.
('57', 228, 7, 35, 373248) But she is very restless and has no control over her thoughts.
('57', 228, 7, 36, 373311) Show her love and do the best you can.

('57', 229, 1, 6, 373681) I can’t bear anyone describing you as too weak to work.
('57', 229, 1, 7, 373737) I am happy that .
('57', 229, 1, 8, 373755) 1 has apologized.
('57', 229, 1, 9, 373773) Take him into your confidence if you can.
('57', 229, 1, 10, 373815) I have observed that he is intelligent.
('57', 229, 1, 11, 373855) How nice it would be if he used his intelligence well.
('57', 229, 1, 12, 373910) The Ashram money is used for any inmate for whom it is necessary to use it, irrespective of his or her position.
('57', 229, 1, 13, 374023) But it is possible to criticize any action.
('57', 229, 1, 14, 374067) Perhaps we do make errors but our aim is always to use the Ashram money impartially.
('57', 229, 1, 15, 374152) The public has a right to inspect every pie of the Ashram’s accounts.
('57', 229, 1, 16, 374222) The Ashram is not a private institution.

('57', 229, 1, 18, 374307) The Ashram will run even if it does not get a single pie, and it will spend even crores if someone gives so much.
('57', 229, 1, 19, 374421) People will give as long as they have trust in us.
('57', 229, 1, 20, 374472) The institution is run by God.
('57', 229, 1, 21, 374503) It is He who prompts people to donate.
('57', 229, 1, 22, 374542) According to me, anyone who goes out of the Ashram should first obtain the Secretary’s permission to do so.

('57', 229, 5, 26, 374764) October 15, 1932 Eradication of untouchability does not imply inter dining and intermarriage with Antyajas.
('57', 229, 5, 27, 374872) But I don’t believe that those who inter dine with the so called untouchables, Harijans, violate dharma.
('57', 229, 5, 28, 374977) Restrictions on inter dining and intermarriage among communities are not an inseparable part of Hinduism.
('57', 229, 5, 29, 375083) They are only a matter of custom.
('57', 229, 5, 30, 375117) We cannot treat Harijans differently from other communities.
('57', 229, 5, 31, 375178) Since there will be no coercion in this matter, there is no reason for anybody to feel hurt.

('57', 230, 8, 11, 375905) I badly need a small dictionary that will give me spelling of Urdu words and a small grammar.

('57', 230, 13, 18, 376302) I may say that during the fast I kept repeating God’s holy name with greater concentration, since I enjoyed great peace in spite of physical suffering.
('57', 230, 13, 19, 376454) It is possible, in certain circumstances, that a person suffering from an incurable disease would not be committing the sin of suicide if he gave up food.
('57', 230, 13, 20, 376609) But such a person, if his mind is clear, has no right to take that step, since he can serve even with his

('57', 231, 2, 3, 376816) Whichever that may be, as far as I remember every illness has proved to be a blessing to me.
('57', 231, 2, 4, 376909) And so it must be to one devoted to God even though the illness may have resulted from his own folly.
('57', 231, 2, 5, 377011) Whether consciously or mechanically, I go on repeating Ramanama every day, but whenever I am in difficulty and feel helpless, I do so consciously and with my whole mind.
('57', 231, 2, 6, 377181) As far as I remember, the repetition on the name has always given me peace.
('57', 231, 2, 7, 377257) I cannot say that I keep some fixed time of period for Ramanama.

('57', 231, 5, 12, 377508) I wished to know the details because they tell me a number of things.
('57', 231, 5, 13, 377578) Everyone must keep an account of every pie spent, even though the money might be one’s own.
('57', 231, 5, 14, 377670) For the truth is that nothing in this world is our own but all belongs to God, as we realize from experience every day.
('57', 231, 5, 15, 377790) Hence, we should not be attached to whatever we enjoy or spend.
('57', 231, 5, 16, 377854) A person who does so will gladly keep an account of every pie for his own satisfaction.
('57', 231, 5, 17, 377942) If you have not kept a detailed account of the expenditure of Rs. 125 in this manner, you should from now on form the habit of keeping such account.
('57', 231, 5, 18, 378091) I remember that Devbhabhi used to keep a full account of her expenses mentally.

('57', 233, 2, 3, 380528) Silence Day, October 17, 1932 This is just 4.20 a.m.
('57', 233, 2, 4, 380581) after morning prayer.
('57', 233, 2, 5, 380603) I got your letter of the 7th instant yesterday.
('57', 233, 2, 6, 380651) The value I attach to your letter you will perceive from the fact that I am devoting to the reply my most precious hour.
('57', 233, 2, 7, 380772) The value lies in that it is an expression of your love and sincerity.
('57', 233, 2, 8, 380843) It has little or no value as an agency designed to carry conviction.
('57', 233, 2, 9, 380912) If I have erred, I should love to have the conviction even after the event since it would serve to protect me against repetition of the error.
('57', 233, 2, 10, 381055) But I miss that conviction.
('57', 233, 2, 11, 381083) I see that though our mutual love remains the same, our view points have become different, our way of approaching things has also become different.
('57', 233, 2, 12, 381231) We have therefore to agree to differ.
('57', 233, 2, 13, 381269) In this matter, I had thought that even if everybody else would not understand my action, you and Millie would instinctively perceive it and become my shield.
('57', 233, 2, 14, 381428) But that pleasure was not to be mine.
('57', 233, 2, 15, 381466) I derive however the richer pleasure that our love can persist even in spite of political and spiritual differences.
('57', 233, 2, 16, 381583) I was unprepared for the latter.
('57', 233, 2, 17, 381616) But I see that political, social and the like are inextricably mixed up with and derived from the spiritual outlook.
('57', 233, 2, 18, 381733) Therefore when we have sharp political differences, the odds are that they are traceable to the spiritual.
('57', 233, 2, 19, 381840) You seem to have missed the very core of the fast.
('57', 233, 2, 20, 381891) You have to go back to my speech 1 at the Minorities Committee.
('57', 233, 2, 21, 381955) It was not a prepared speech.
('57', 233, 2, 22, 381985) The end of it came irresistibly.
('57', 233, 2, 23, 382018) The fast was an inevitable result of that solemn declaration.
('57', 233, 2, 24, 382080) I little knew how that declaration was to find fulfilment.
('57', 233, 2, 25, 382139) I say that the declaration was from God and so was the fulfilment.
('57', 233, 2, 26, 382206) If it was so, all argument is useless.
('57', 233, 2, 27, 382245) If it was a hallucination, friends who believe it to be such are bound to drive home the truth to me with all the love and persistence they can summon to their assistance.
('57', 233, 2, 28, 382417) Everything that happened since confirms me in the opinion that the fast was a God given trust.
('57', 233, 2, 29, 382512) Not the Premier but Sir Samuel was the vehicle through whom the message of the fast had necessarily to go.
('57', 233, 2, 30, 382619) But if you had followed all the statements I have made and even my letter to the Premier you

('57', 234, 1, 2, 382840) would have seen that the fast was addressed to the millions who had faith in me, and who had surrounded me with their undying affection whenever I went in their midst.
('57', 234, 1, 3, 383008) They understood the fast with all its implications without any argument.
('57', 234, 1, 4, 383081) For them, the political part of it was trivial; internal reform was everything.
('57', 234, 1, 5, 383161) The latter is still going on.
('57', 234, 1, 6, 383191) And remember the fast is only suspended, it may have to be resumed if people go off to sleep.
('57', 234, 1, 7, 383285) When a lover fasts to prevent the loved one from going astray, it is not blackmail, it is the cry of an anguished heart ascending to heaven.
('57', 234, 1, 8, 383426) Of such, in your language, is the music of the spheres made.
('57', 234, 1, 9, 383487) My fast was a whip administered to lethargic love.
('57', 234, 1, 10, 383538) You ask why it was not administered ten years ago.
('57', 234, 1, 11, 383589) The answer is: God did not call me to it.
('57', 234, 1, 12, 383631) He comes to wake you up when you least except Him.
('57', 234, 1, 13, 383682) His ways are not our ways.
('57', 234, 1, 14, 383709) You will of course believe me when I say that I had then the same capacity for sacrifice that I seem to have now.
('57', 234, 1, 15, 383823) Lastly, you should accept my judgment based on much ampler data than yours that the same settlement could not have been arrived at in London and that the Premier was not called upon in any way to decide on any question outside the Hindu Muslim Sikh tangle.
('57', 234, 1, 16, 384080) Love to you all.

('57', 235, 6, 18, 385423) When Father Elwin was leaving, he thought that it would be a good thing if my Christian friends could mentally be in communion with me once every week.
('57', 235, 6, 19, 385575) For that purpose, he asked me to suggest a hymn which all of them might sing at a fixed hour one day every week.
('57', 235, 6, 20, 385688) I selected Newman’s hymn.
('57', 235, 6, 21, 385714) It is now sung by friends in America, Europe, India and other countries on every Friday at 7.30 p.m.

('57', 236, 7, 14, 386791) October 18, 1932
('57', 236, 8, 15, 386808) DEAR MR. HUDSON 2,
('57', 236, 9, 16, 386827) You will, I hope pardon this presumption.
('57', 236, 9, 17, 386869) The restriction you conveyed to Dr. Ambedkar and me in connection with his interview, I had no difficulty in understanding from the Government standpoint.
('57', 236, 9, 18, 387024) 3 It was faithfully carried out, and so far as I am concerned I shall breathe not a word to the public about it.
('57', 236, 9, 19, 387137) But the threat conveyed at the end of your note was, I think, gratuitously offensive.
('57', 236, 9, 20, 387223) You said that if either of us did not carry out the restriction, all such future interviews would be stopped.
('57', 236, 9, 21, 387333) So far as I am concerned, it is easy enough for you to verify that I have meticulously observed the prison regulations.
('57', 236, 9, 22, 387453) And the threat pre supposes that such interviews are a concession, whereas in my opinion they are the necessary consequence of the Yeravda Pact.
('57', 236, 9, 23, 387598) Surely untouchability reform should be, if it is not, common cause between the Government and the people.
('57', 236, 9, 24, 387704) Again a prison was assuredly not the place to spring upon Dr. Ambedkar, a free man, restrictions
('57', 236, 10, 25, 387801) 1 The letter, according to the sources, was in Urdu.
('57', 236, 10, 26, 387854) 2 Home Member in the Viceroy’s Executive Council 3 The addressee in his note had desired Gandhiji and Dr. Ambedkar to be informed that Government would not allow any report of the discussions to find their way into the Press, “or any manifesto to be issued by Mr. Gandhi”.

('57', 237, 1, 2, 388169) accompanied by a threat of which he was not informed in the telegram acceding to his request for an interview with Srimati Sarojini Naidu and me.
('57', 237, 1, 3, 388315) May I in this personal note ask now for a definite reply to my letter 1 of the 29th ult.
('57', 237, 1, 4, 388404) addressed to Major Bhandari and forwarded to the Home Department?
('57', 237, 1, 5, 388470) In view of your said memorandum, a clear definition of the Government policy has become doubly necessary.
('57', 237, 1, 6, 388576) I hold it to be essential that I should be permitted to see people and carry on correspondence, stirctly regarding untouchability, without let or hindrance.
('57', 237, 1, 7, 388733) You may know that my fast is only suspended.
('57', 237, 1, 8, 388778) It has to be resumed if the Hindu public do not play the game by the Harijans.
('57', 237, 1, 9, 388857) My contact with the public therefore is inevitable if the reform is to be carried out in all its thoroughness.
('57', 237, 1, 10, 388968) A. V. Thakkar, the Secretary of the newly formed League has already asked for instructions.
('57', 237, 1, 11, 389060) I have informed him that I am awaiting clear definition of Government policy before I could send any instructions.
('57', 237, 1, 12, 389175) I would therefore esteem an early reply.
('57', 237, 2, 13, 389216) Yours sincerely,

('57', 237, 7, 19, 389421) MANILAL,
('57', 237, 8, 20, 389430) I got your letter.
('57', 237, 8, 21, 389449) You may come whenever you wish.
('57', 237, 8, 22, 389481) It would be good if Sushila can accompany you, but she need not come if she is weak.
('57', 237, 8, 23, 389566) Bring Sita if she comes.
('57', 237, 8, 24, 389591) You should take care and see that your bowels move regularly.
('57', 237, 8, 25, 389653) Take only light food.
('57', 237, 8, 26, 389675) It will help you if you can take more milk.
('57', 237, 8, 27, 389719) Take care and safegurard your health.
('57', 237, 8, 28, 389757) Tell Ba that I have asked for a prescription from Major Advani.

('57', 238, 6, 9, 390237) October 19, 1932
('57', 238, 7, 10, 390254) MIRA, Your letter came in today.
('57', 238, 7, 11, 390287) My progress continues.
('57', 238, 7, 12, 390310) There is no change in the food.
('57', 238, 7, 13, 390342) The weight has gone up to 99 1/2. I have almost reached the normal strength.
('57', 238, 7, 14, 390419) I had a long letter from Kisen giving a graphic description of your activities.
('57', 238, 7, 15, 390499) Naturally you miss her and she misses you.
('57', 238, 7, 16, 390542) She says she profited much by your company.
('57', 238, 7, 17, 390586) You mentioned criminals as your companions now.
('57', 238, 7, 18, 390634) The word criminal should be taboo from our dictionary.
('57', 238, 7, 19, 390689) Or we are all criminals.
('57', 238, 7, 20, 390714) ‘Those of you that are without sin cast the first stone’.
('57', 238, 7, 21, 390772) And no one was found to dare cast the stone at the sinning harlot.
('57', 238, 7, 22, 390839) As a jailor once said all are criminals in secret.
('57', 238, 7, 23, 390890) There is profound truth in that saying half uttered in jest.
('57', 238, 7, 24, 390951) Let them be therefore good companions.
('57', 238, 7, 25, 390990) I know that this is easier said than done.
('57', 238, 7, 26, 391033) And that is exactly what the Gita, and as a matter of fact all religions, enjoin upon us to do.
('57', 238, 7, 27, 391129) Did I not tell you that during the fast we were removed to another yard where there could be more seclusion.
('57', 238, 7, 28, 391238) Our feline companions were therefore left behind us.
('57', 238, 7, 29, 391291) We have now been brought back to the old yard much to the joy of these gay four footed companions.
('57', 238, 7, 30, 391390) They are all purring round about us.
('57', 238, 7, 31, 391427) I understand what you say about your studies.

('57', 239, 6, 13, 391926) You do not write how you are.
('57', 239, 6, 14, 391956) Has Manu forgotten me because he does not live in the Ashram now?
('57', 239, 6, 15, 392022) He has to send me some more descriptions, and has still to pass the examination in good handwriting.
('57', 239, 6, 16, 392123) It will not do, therefore, if he stops writing to me.

('57', 239, 10, 20, 392297) October 19, 1932
('57', 239, 11, 21, 392314) BHAISHRI VALJI, I got your letter and the book.
('57', 239, 11, 22, 392362) Expecting that this letter will reach you, I am not sending it by registered post to save the cost.
('57', 239, 11, 23, 392462) Do write to me, however, when you get it.
('57', 239, 11, 24, 392504) I may say that almost as soon as I got the book I went through it.
('57', 239, 11, 25, 392571) I find your language sweet, so I did not pay attention to it.
('57', 239, 11, 26, 392633) If I did I might, in my wisdom, want to suggest a few corrections, but they seem to be immaterial.
('57', 239, 11, 27, 392732) I was not favourably impressed by the book.
('57', 239, 11, 28, 392776) You call it Ishucharita 1, but I do not see anything in it to justify the title.
('57', 239, 11, 29, 392857) If I remember correctly, you once told me or I told somebody that I believed you thought yourself too humble to produce anything

('57', 240, 1, 2, 393054) original and that you were satisfied with translating the best that the ancestors had left to us.
('57', 240, 1, 3, 393152) If I accept this argument, I would perhaps approve your book.
('57', 240, 1, 4, 393214) But I do not accept the argument.
('57', 240, 1, 5, 393248) If it is accepted in your case, it should be accepted for others too.
('57', 240, 1, 6, 393318) And if all acted accordingly, the only result would be that we would drown ourselves in the waters of our ancestors’ well.
('57', 240, 1, 7, 393441) I believe that it is our duty to augment the legacy of the ancestors and to change it into current coin and make it acceptable to the present age.
('57', 240, 1, 8, 393588) Mere translation cannot achieve this.
('57', 240, 1, 9, 393626) What you have given in your book is already available in Gujarati.
('57', 240, 1, 10, 393693) The translations brought out after immense industry by Christians themselves are not bad.
('57', 240, 1, 11, 393783) Why should we put them in people’s hands?
('57', 240, 1, 12, 393825) I am sure you do not write such books so that people may read your sweet language.
('57', 240, 1, 13, 393908) Even if you do, your purpose will not be served.
('57', 240, 1, 14, 393957) In my view this book is an example of a kind of lethargy.
('57', 240, 1, 15, 394015) I am sure that you would not call a man industrious merely because he reads much and writes much.
('57', 240, 1, 16, 394113) As for you, I believe that you have a mania for reading and translating.
('57', 240, 1, 17, 394186) You ought to get rid of it.
('57', 240, 1, 18, 394214) What I should like you to do is this.
('57', 240, 1, 19, 394252) Give us by all means a book on the life of Jesus.
('57', 240, 1, 20, 394302) Read the New Testamant as often as you please, but then put the book on a shelf and create a living picture of Jesus from what you have read.
('57', 240, 1, 21, 394444) Do not think that because the book has been printed, you must give it to the people.
('57', 240, 1, 22, 394529) If you find substance in my view, cancel the printed matter and don’t mind if so much money is wasted.
('57', 240, 1, 23, 394632) Try to write something original as I have suggested.
('57', 240, 1, 24, 394685) If you feel that it would be too much trouble to do so, keep quiet; give up reading and engage yourself in physical activity to improve your health.
('57', 240, 1, 25, 394834) I have seen many persons both in India and elsewhere who suffer from the mania of reading.
('57', 240, 1, 26, 394925) You also have that disease.
('57', 240, 1, 27, 394953) To get rid of it take walks, contemplete the beauty of God’s creation, read the book of nature, learn the language of trees, listen to the music of spheres in the sky, watch the drama enacted in it every night; and during the day spin, when you feel tired, do sewing or, if you can, carpentry or shoe making.
('57', 240, 1, 28, 395262) I know that your hand gets benumbed if you strain it, but with practice that will disappear.
('57', 240, 1, 29, 395355) There are in English many beautifully written books on the life of Jesus.
('57', 240, 1, 30, 395429) We can get some material even from them, but I would not put that burden on you.
('57', 241, 0, 1, 395510) 242 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 241, 1, 2, 395552) The portion relating to Angels, etc., in your book should be left out.
('57', 241, 1, 3, 395623) Why add to the superabundance of things that we already have.
('57', 241, 1, 4, 395685) Even if in fact the Angels and the wise men had not come, Jesus’s fame would not suffer.
('57', 241, 1, 5, 395774) My complaint is that you have failed to raise before the reader a vivid image of Jesus.
('57', 241, 1, 6, 395862) You have merely given the teaching of Jesus and that, too, through quotations.
('57', 241, 1, 7, 395941) Will anyone disbelieve you if you give it in your own words?
('57', 241, 1, 8, 396002) I do not know what type of readers you had in view in writing this book.
('57', 241, 1, 9, 396075) If you have the general mass in view, you should not have inflicted foreign names on them.
('57', 241, 1, 10, 396166) A man like me whose reading is very limited cannot make out whether you have decked the Biblical names in clothes of your make or in borrowed clothes.
('57', 241, 1, 11, 396317) I am afraid there is not much to be gained from things of this kind.
('57', 241, 1, 12, 396386) If your intention was to give names that might sound well in Gujarati, you should have coined fitting Gujarati names suggesting the same meanings as the corresponding Biblical names, as the latter are always significant.
('57', 241, 1, 13, 396607) If, regardless of my criticism, you decide that the book should be published, it is not necessary to offer the book free, charging only postage.
('57', 241, 1, 14, 396752) Do not mind if people do not buy it even at cost price.
('57', 241, 1, 15, 396808) The book is bound to sell as it will bear your name.
('57', 241, 1, 16, 396861) (But don’t take that as test of the quality of the book.) Your work ended with the writing, it will be up to some philanthropic institution which distributes such books free among people to give copies of this one, if it so wishes, to those who cannot afford to buy it even at cost price.
('57', 241, 1, 17, 397150) It is best that one person should not attempt to ride two horses at a time.
('57', 241, 1, 18, 397226) Let that sum of Rs. 150 grow with compound interest.
('57', 241, 1, 19, 397279) I have written much more than I had intended.
('57', 241, 1, 20, 397325) Moreover, I have let myself go in my criticism, which means that I have yielded to ignorant nature and so I have decided to spend money on registering this.
('57', 241, 1, 21, 397482) Do you like the takli because you can spin on it while walking?
('57', 241, 1, 22, 397546) One can spin on it while resting.
('57', 241, 1, 23, 397580) Excessive greed for anything is the root of all evil.
('57', 241, 1, 24, 397634) Your present task is to make your body as strong as steel.

('57', 242, 2, 3, 397868) October 19, 1932
('57', 242, 3, 4, 397885) BHAISHRI KHAMBHATTA, I have read your letter to Mahadev.
('57', 242, 3, 5, 397942) I do not know at all what blue brain is.
('57', 242, 3, 6, 397983) When Dr. Gilder left after examining me the blood pressure was normal.
('57', 242, 3, 7, 398054) My health is quite all right, and I have nearly regained my former strength.
('57', 242, 3, 8, 398131) I have my daily walks, spin as much as I used to and can also write a large number of letters.
('57', 242, 3, 9, 398226) I spend all the twenty four hours in the open.
('57', 242, 3, 10, 398273) What is blue brain, and who told you that I had high blood pressure and that there was a danger of my getting blue brain?
('57', 242, 3, 11, 398395) Why should I be prejudiced against Bhai Mehta?
('57', 242, 3, 12, 398442) Was it not I who sent Vidya to him?
('57', 242, 3, 13, 398478) But it was not necessary to send for him daily during the fast.
('57', 242, 3, 14, 398542) And that could not be done either, in jail.
('57', 242, 3, 15, 398586) It would have been improper for me to call him when so many other doctors were visiting me.
('57', 242, 3, 16, 398678) Moreover, he could not have helped me much.
('57', 242, 3, 17, 398722) Having had experience of many fasts, I am bound to know my body.
('57', 242, 3, 18, 398787) Mehta could only suggest some simple measures and I had asked him if he knew any.
('57', 242, 3, 19, 398869) Even now he may send his suggestions, if he has any.
('57', 242, 3, 20, 398922) Please send me his address.
('57', 242, 3, 21, 398950) I will certainly write to him to please him.
('57', 242, 3, 22, 398995) In any case you should write to him and tell him that he may send me any suggestions he wishes to and write to me freely.
('57', 242, 3, 23, 399117) And you also should not worry.
('57', 242, 3, 24, 399148) I will let you know if there is any difficulty.
('57', 242, 3, 25, 399196) I am returning today the books about massage.
('57', 242, 3, 26, 399242) As I had a slight fear that the pain in the hand might come back, I have given up spinning with the left hand and rotate the wheel with the foot.

('57', 243, 3, 6, 399751) I did not receive Surendra’s letter (postcard).
('57', 243, 3, 7, 399799) I will certainly inquire now.
('57', 243, 3, 8, 399829) I am all right.

('57', 243, 7, 13, 400049) October 19, 1932 I got your letter of the 8th and the accompanying note.
('57', 243, 7, 14, 400122) I have gone through the latter.
('57', 243, 7, 15, 400154) I don’t think that it should be published.
('57', 243, 7, 16, 400197) It leaves out a great deal, and what it includes is put in a form which can be easily misunderstood.
('57', 243, 7, 17, 400298) I am, therefore, of the opinion that no part of it should be published.
('57', 243, 7, 18, 400370) All that is necessary to state is that the relation between Baba and me is not that of guru and disciple but is that of two ordinary friends, and that most of the conversation related to spiritual matters.
('57', 243, 7, 19, 400576) Thus, the public here or in the West need not attach any importance to our meeting or conversation.

('57', 243, 10, 22, 400739) October 19, 1932 We should not insist on taking a Harijan to a hospital or temple at a place where public opinion is against such action.
('57', 243, 10, 23, 400877) However, those who wish to serve Harijans may provide such facilities in their own locality or near it and also invite other Hindus, if they wish, to avail themselves of such hospitals or temples.
('57', 243, 10, 24, 401074) Meanwhile we should continue to plead with the people gently.
('57', 243, 10, 25, 401136) We shall not help our cause by getting angry with the people or by indulging in bitter criticsm of them.
('57', 243, 10, 26, 401241) We can overcome their ignorance by showing perfect love towards them.
('57', 243, 10, 27, 401311) We should make Herculean efforts to provide for

('57', 244, 1, 3, 401448) The State authorities can do a great deal.
('57', 244, 1, 4, 401491) It may give them lands, improve the localities where they live, build them good houses, pay them better salaries, etc.
('57', 244, 1, 5, 401610) People should not give left overs to Harijans.
('57', 244, 1, 6, 401657) We should try to teach them rules of cleanliness, etc.
('57', 244, 1, 7, 401712) In short, we should take all necessary measures, without creating any conflict, for improving their conditions of life.

('57', 244, 4, 12, 401990) I can understand your hardships 1. I have had a long discussion with Babasaheb Ambedkar.
('57', 244, 4, 13, 402079) I can do little service from here.
('57', 244, 4, 14, 402114) All I can do is to advise you to acquaint the newly formed association 2 with your tale of woes.
('57', 244, 4, 15, 402211) And of course keep writing to me.
('57', 244, 4, 16, 402245) That you remain Hindu is no favour to others.
('57', 244, 4, 17, 402291) Hence how can I advise you to forsake Hinduism because of the hardships?
('57', 244, 4, 18, 402364) It is in tribulation that one’s dharma is put to test.
('57', 244, 4, 19, 402419) But I can certainly assure you that I have staked my life for the amelioration of your lot.
('57', 244, 4, 20, 402511) If other Hindus do not treat you justly, I shall atone for it by resuming my suspended fast.
('57', 244, 4, 21, 402604) May God give me the strength to do this.

('57', 245, 2, 3, 403019) October 19, 1932 If abolition of castes means the abolition of the varna I do not approve of it.
('57', 245, 2, 4, 403116) But I am with you if your aim is to end the innumerable caste distinctions.
('57', 245, 2, 5, 403192) All the same eradication of untouchability and abolition of castes are separate problems.
('57', 245, 2, 6, 403282) Eradication of untouch ability requires that we deal with the untouchables in the way we do with other Hindus.
('57', 245, 2, 7, 403393) Mixing up the two problems would jeopardize the success of both.
('57', 245, 2, 8, 403458) For this reason intermarriage and inter dining with untouchables are not an integral feature of the removal of untouch abliity, but their practice is not against religion either.

('57', 245, 5, 13, 403813) The other is stupid but learns by constant effort.
('57', 245, 5, 14, 403864) Both by individual effort triumph over fate.
('57', 245, 5, 15, 403909) Fasting usually does not result in permanent weakening of the system; on the contrary frequent fasts bring an ultimate improvement of health.
('57', 245, 5, 16, 404051) Every man can judge by experience his limits for fasting.
('57', 245, 5, 17, 404109) Everything can be set right if the trade is carried on by setting up a loom and charkha in the home.
('57', 245, 5, 18, 404210) I have not seen the Hindi translations.
('57', 245, 5, 19, 404250) But it has been my feeling for a long time that even sesame oil cannot supplant olive oil.
('57', 245, 5, 20, 404341) Some people do use linseed oil but I have no knowledge in this respect.
('57', 245, 5, 21, 404413) I have heard great praises of triphala 2 but I have very little faith in medicines.
('57', 245, 5, 22, 404497) I believe in nature cure.
('57', 245, 5, 23, 404523) Devdas has no intention at present of marrying.
('57', 245, 5, 24, 404571) No one in my knowledge has married for the purpose of realizing God.
('57', 245, 5, 25, 404640) Devdas is not free from passion.
('57', 245, 5, 26, 404673) It is not a matter of surprise or regret to me.
('57', 245, 5, 27, 404721) Marriage is a means of regulating passion but it has a sublime purpose too.

('57', 247, 2, 3, 406602) October 20, 1932
('57', 247, 3, 4, 406619) MY DEAREST CHARLIE, I have your letter.
('57', 247, 3, 5, 406659) God’s grace has been wonderful.
('57', 247, 3, 6, 406691) Those days were days of basking in the sunshine of His presence.
('57', 247, 3, 7, 406756) There was not one step taken out of self will.
('57', 247, 3, 8, 406803) Never have I experienced such an immediate response to prayer.
('57', 247, 3, 9, 406866) Yes, it was well you stayed there.
('57', 247, 3, 10, 406901) I knew what it would mean for you to remain there.
('57', 247, 3, 11, 406952) And yet I did not take a moment to decide the reply to your cable.
('57', 247, 3, 12, 407019) Vallabhbhai and Mahadev too had never any doubt about the correctness of the decision.
('57', 247, 3, 13, 407106) Indeed it is wonderful how they instinctively felt the soundness of all the fateful decisions that had to be taken during those terrible days.
('57', 247, 3, 14, 407249) But the work has only just begun.
('57', 247, 3, 15, 407283) It is a life and death struggle for me.
('57', 247, 3, 16, 407323) The fast has to be a fast to the finish or untouchability has to go now.
('57', 247, 3, 17, 407396) It is a tremendous task.
('57', 247, 3, 18, 407421) I must test the affection of the millions who have flocked to those meetings, I have to wrestle with God Himself.
('57', 247, 3, 19, 407535) But He is both indulgent and exacting.
('57', 247, 3, 20, 407574) He will have full surrender or none.
('57', 247, 3, 21, 407611) The late fast was possibly only a prelude to what is yet to come.
('57', 247, 3, 22, 407677) But no more of speculation.
('57', 247, 3, 23, 407705) His will, not mine be done.
('57', 247, 3, 24, 407733) I can but try to prove worthy of the sacrifice if it has to come.
('57', 247, 3, 25, 407799) And you have still to be there.
('57', 247, 3, 26, 407831) The untouchability you speak of is far subtler and wears the cloak of respectability.
('57', 247, 3, 27, 407917) Ours in India looks what it is and therefore in a way less difficult perhaps to fight.
('57', 247, 3, 28, 408004) I have almost regained my lost strength.
('57', 247, 3, 29, 408045) Our love to you and all the members of the ever growing family.

('57', 248, 1, 4, 408644) And why do you think that we can serve only with the body?
('57', 248, 1, 5, 408703) Mind is a far more powerful instrument of service.
('57', 248, 1, 6, 408754) Those serve best who have perfect purity of heart.
('57', 248, 1, 7, 408805) Indeed, we serve so as to attain perfect purity.
('57', 248, 1, 8, 408854) Thoughts of the pure in heart can do what the bodies with corrupt hearts can never do.
('57', 248, 1, 9, 408941) Therefore in no case have you the slightest cause for despair.
('57', 248, 1, 10, 409004) Do not seek to prove how thoughts work.
('57', 248, 1, 11, 409044) Enough for you to believe that they do work and produce mighty results.
('57', 248, 1, 12, 409116) Therefore, always cultivating purity of heart, you should be perfectly at peace whether you are well in body or not.

('57', 248, 5, 19, 409439) Real praying from the heart brings the real work behind it.
('57', 248, 5, 20, 409499) For in the end work itself becomes prayer.
('57', 248, 5, 21, 409542) I like your simple affirmation ‘I am clean now’.

('57', 249, 10, 20, 411246) Essential religion has nothing to do with the regulation of such social relations.

('57', 249, 12, 22, 411363) 1 The addressee had said that in Madras they objected to the untouchables being called ‘Harijans’ because they were Shaivas and not Vaishnavas.
('57', 249, 12, 23, 411507) They ought, therefore, to be called ‘Harajans’—men of Shiva—or Adi Hindus.

('57', 251, 8, 9, 412830) BHAI NARAYAN KULKARNI,
('57', 251, 9, 10, 412853) I have your letter.
('57', 251, 9, 11, 412873) I regret my inability to write in Marathi.
('57', 251, 9, 12, 412916) I hope that you will find no difficulty in following my Hindi.
('57', 251, 9, 13, 412979) Several vaidya friends of mine had informed me three or four years ago that honey should not be taken in warm water.
('57', 251, 9, 14, 413096) My other friends, the allopathic doctors have no objection to it.
('57', 251, 9, 15, 413162) But I am not influenced by their opinion as they have not made a close study of the effects of articles of food.
('57', 251, 9, 16, 413275) In their system they do not observe much 1
('57', 251, 10, 17, 413318) distinction between what may be eaten and what eschewed.
('57', 251, 10, 18, 413375) But I am writing of my personal experience.
('57', 251, 10, 19, 413419) I have found no harm but rather benefit by taking honey with warm water.
('57', 251, 10, 20, 413492) I started taking honey on a doctor’s advice which came about in this way.
('57', 251, 10, 21, 413566) Owing to a lack of carbohydrates in my system sugar was needed.
('57', 251, 10, 22, 413630) The best sugar in his opinion was obtained from honey.
('57', 251, 10, 23, 413685) I have taken honey since then and he never objected to my taking it in warm water.
('57', 251, 10, 24, 413768) My complaint against our vaidyas is that they hold on to whatever is expounded in the ancient texts even if it be contrary to experience as they consider them the last word.
('57', 251, 10, 25, 413942) I am sure in the Ayurvedic system there is need for further research.
('57', 251, 10, 26, 414012) It should be revised in the light of experience.
('57', 251, 10, 27, 414061) Does honey lose its property by being poured into hot water?
('57', 251, 10, 28, 414122) Have you made a chemical analysis of honey?
('57', 251, 10, 29, 414166) Obesity and leanness are relative 2 terms.
('57', 251, 10, 30, 414209) For which kind of leanness is warm honey undesirable and why so?
('57', 251, 10, 31, 414274) To conclude, have you proved by experience what you write?

('57', 252, 17, 31, 415456) Do you get clear motions?
('57', 252, 17, 32, 415482) If there is pain you should eat only leafy vegetables, fruit and a little milk, or only leafy vegetables and fruit.
('57', 252, 17, 33, 415598) To reduce her obesity Amina should eat only bread and leafy vegetables.

('57', 253, 10, 15, 416212) October 21, 1932
('57', 253, 11, 16, 416229) MY DEAR MARY,
('57', 253, 12, 17, 416243) I have your letter.
('57', 253, 12, 18, 416263) Devdas has been overworking himself.
('57', 253, 12, 19, 416300) He had therefore a slight attack of fever.
('57', 253, 12, 20, 416343) He is, I understand, better again.
('57', 253, 12, 21, 416378) It is true I do not believe in idol worship in the sense generally understood.
('57', 253, 12, 22, 416457) But I do not disbelieve in others worshipping God through idols.
('57', 253, 12, 23, 416522) In one sense we are all idol worshippers.
('57', 253, 12, 24, 416564) We worship God of our image.
('57', 253, 12, 25, 416593) That image need not have a physical form.
('57', 253, 12, 26, 416635) Each one has his own imagination of and attributes for God.
('57', 253, 12, 27, 416695) And yet God in reality is without attributes and beyond our imagination.
('57', 253, 12, 28, 416768) Hence when we form our own picture of God, we are idol worshippers.
('57', 253, 12, 29, 416836) Therefore my mind does not condemn those who conceive God as residing in a stone or metal image.
('57', 253, 12, 30, 416933) They are not wrong for God is everywhere and in everything.
('57', 253, 12, 31, 416993) Now whenever we want to worship God in everything we consecrate it.
('57', 253, 12, 32, 417061) But if a man excludes his fellows from participation in common worship we are entitled to say that God flees from such worship.
('57', 253, 12, 33, 417189) And He is installed when there is repentance and the bar against one’s fellows is removed.
('57', 253, 12, 34, 417280) I hope this explanation is

('57', 254, 1, 3, 417424) In my opinion it covers a profound truth.
('57', 254, 1, 4, 417466) If the truth is not seen, the fault lies in my inability to express clearly what I want to say.

('57', 256, 11, 27, 421515) I have made one improvement.
('57', 256, 11, 28, 421544) I changed your spindle frame and fixed that of the Gandiv Charkha in its place.
('57', 256, 11, 29, 421624) I therefore introduced a spring.
('57', 256, 11, 30, 421657) The result was that yarn was easily drawn fine.
('57', 256, 11, 31, 421705) I used to spin yarn of twenty counts with great difficulty and then had made some progress.
('57', 256, 11, 32, 421797) Now I can easily spin yarn of thirty counts.
('57', 256, 11, 33, 421842) The speed is still the same, that is, a hundred rounds per hour.
('57', 256, 11, 34, 421907) Even a little more at times.
('57', 256, 11, 35, 421936) I may be able to increase
('57', 257, 0, 1, 421962) 258 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 257, 1, 2, 422004) the speed as also the count.
('57', 257, 1, 3, 422033) The spindle frame still needs some changes.
('57', 257, 1, 4, 422077) But I have now no carpenter.
('57', 257, 1, 5, 422106) The carpenter prisoners have been released on the completion of their terms.
('57', 257, 1, 6, 422183) You seem to have lost control over your expenditure and seem to be asking for money as you please.
('57', 257, 1, 7, 422282) This is not right.
('57', 257, 1, 8, 422301) You have vowed to keep within your budget.
('57', 257, 1, 9, 422344) You must not go beyond that.
('57', 257, 1, 10, 422373) You must always keep this in mind and consult the statement before asking even for one extra rupee.
('57', 257, 1, 11, 422473) If it does not provide for any particular amount, you should not ask for it no matter how big the temptation before you.
('57', 257, 1, 12, 422594) If there is something very important, you must take prior permission and should not, if you do not get it, feel peeved even inwardly but remain undisturbed.
('57', 257, 1, 13, 422751) If you do not maintain such firmness, the work will come to a stop.Narandas must be having the budget which I had sent to you, and you also must have kept a copy.
('57', 257, 1, 14, 422914) If you have not, send for one.
('57', 257, 1, 15, 422945) Do not work beyond your strength.
('57', 257, 1, 16, 422979) Be satisfied with a little.
('57', 257, 1, 17, 423007) I have almost regained my previous strength.
('57', 257, 2, 18, 423052) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] Will a popgun not be enough for wild animals?
('57', 257, 2, 19, 423124) I think it does not require a licence.
('57', 257, 2, 20, 423163) I once saw an advertisement about it.

('57', 258, 5, 6, 423845) October 22, 1932 By a constant study of the Gita, you should learn to shed all care.
('57', 258, 5, 7, 423930) When God is the caretaker for us all, why need we carry the burden?
('57', 258, 5, 8, 423998) Ours is but to do the task that falls to our lot.
('57', 258, 5, 9, 424048) Hence I would urge you not to think of retirement.
('57', 258, 5, 10, 424099) True retir ement is not a physical state, it comes from within.
('57', 258, 5, 11, 424163) We have to find retirement in the midst of ceaseless work.
('57', 258, 5, 12, 424222) And, are not the minds of those who are living in caves, oftner than not ceaselessly at work?
('57', 258, 5, 13, 424316) We should not brood on our hard lot.
('57', 258, 5, 14, 424353) The lot of those who would serve is generally, if not always, hard.

('57', 258, 9, 18, 424501) SHARDA,
('57', 258, 10, 19, 424509) You can certainly take hip baths even when you have fever.
('57', 258, 10, 20, 424568) I had given hip baths to a coughing old man of 75 years and his asthma was cured.
('57', 258, 10, 21, 424650) While taking a hip bath the upper portion of the body should be covered and also the legs if you feel cold.
('57', 258, 10, 22, 424758) Only the portion between the abdomen and the thighs is kept in water and during the treatment the abdomen in gently rubbed with a small towel.
('57', 258, 10, 23, 424901) The patient enjoys this bath.
('57', 258, 10, 24, 424931) He shivers while getting into the tub but once in it, he enjoys it.
('57', 258, 10, 25, 424999) Diet should be simple and the bowels must clear daily.
('57', 258, 10, 26, 425054) Continue to have oil message as usual.
('57', 258, 10, 27, 425093) And you should not let yourself be tired.
('57', 258, 10, 28, 425135) Then see how healthy your body becomes.
('57', 258, 10, 29, 425175) I have no objection to idol worship by any one who has need of it.
('57', 258, 11, 30, 425242) 1 The addressee had asked Gandhiji why he did not resort to satyagraha against terrorists as he did against untouchability.

('57', 259, 1, 2, 425408) not feel the need of it.
('57', 259, 1, 3, 425433) Millions can do without it.
('57', 259, 1, 4, 425461) Moreover, all of us are idol worshippers in a sense.
('57', 259, 1, 5, 425514) Anyone who worships God by attributing virtues to them is an idol worshipper.
('57', 259, 1, 6, 425592) I have written this very briefly.
('57', 259, 1, 7, 425626) Ask me again if you have not understood.
('57', 259, 1, 8, 425667) I shall explain at greater length.
('57', 259, 1, 9, 425702) But before that, try to understand from Narandas.
('57', 259, 1, 10, 425752) Consult Chimanlal too.

('57', 259, 6, 15, 425940) The report is good.
('57', 259, 6, 16, 425960) It is a matter of regret that not much khadi was sold during the Puja season.
('57', 259, 6, 17, 426038) Consult Ghanshyamdasji about this and see if he can do something.
('57', 259, 6, 18, 426104) Arun must have got my letter 1. All this touring should not affect yourhealth.

('57', 259, 10, 24, 426364) You can give up hip bath but not sitz bath.
('57', 259, 10, 25, 426408) You can take it between two and three in the afternoon.
('57', 259, 10, 26, 426464) The water can be first warmed in the sun and the bath may last for two or three minutes only.
('57', 259, 10, 27, 426558) It is good that you are re reading Talash e Haq 2. You must not work to excess.
('57', 259, 10, 28, 426638) Purification will come by and by, you must be patient.
('57', 259, 10, 29, 426693) It is very good that Kudsia has become equable.
('57', 259, 10, 30, 426741) Can you understand fully what I have written?
('57', 259, 10, 31, 426787) Tell me if you find any difficulty.

('57', 260, 2, 4, 427127) 1 You have almost converted me.
('57', 260, 2, 5, 427159) I knew the sinfulness (for me) of taking wild honey.
('57', 260, 2, 6, 427212) But stupidly and lazily I went on taking it.
('57', 260, 2, 7, 427257) Your graphic description of the manner in which wild honey is prepared has almost driven me to the abjuring of wild honey.
('57', 260, 2, 8, 427380) So you see what you would have me to do when, if ever, I am outside Yeravda, I am likely to do almost immediately.
('57', 260, 2, 9, 427495) But surely there must be places in India where innocent honey is prepared.
('57', 260, 2, 10, 427570) What about the Himalayan honey which we see in the market?
('57', 260, 2, 11, 427629) It was good of you to have sent the different varieties of honey 2. The parcel has not yet been received.
('57', 260, 2, 12, 427735) I know we shall all eat it with relish and without any sense of guilt.
('57', 260, 2, 13, 427806) Do you stock these honeys or have you specially brought the specimens sent by you?
('57', 260, 2, 14, 427889) With regards from us all,
('57', 260, 3, 15, 427915) Your sincerely, M. K. GANDHI PS.
('57', 260, 3, 16, 427948) Do I gather from your letter that it is possible to extract honey by scientific means from wild honeycombs without injuring the comb or the bees?
('57', 260, 3, 17, 428094) If it is not, must wild honey be beyond human reach unless one is prepared to destroy the comb and the bees?

('57', 260, 8, 21, 428280) You should not despair.
('57', 260, 8, 22, 428304) We ought to be able to overcome a simple complaint like constipation.
('57', 260, 8, 23, 428374) It can be cured by determined effort.
('57', 260, 8, 24, 428412) One should not neglect it, nor worry about it.
('57', 260, 8, 25, 428459) The argument you had with Dr. Talwalkar was unfortunate.
('57', 260, 8, 26, 428516) I am writing to him.
('57', 260, 9, 27, 428537) 1 In a long letter the addressee had described how wild honey was extracted, how impure it was and how it involved destruction of bees.
('57', 260, 9, 28, 428673) 2 The addressee had sent Gandhiji’s specimens of Palestinian honey, American honey, New Zealand honey and French honey.
('57', 261, 0, 1, 428793) 262 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 261, 1, 2, 428835) Read the letter 1 and understand it.
('57', 261, 1, 3, 428872) Narandas will show it to you if he thinks fit.
('57', 261, 1, 4, 428919) Bhaji is certainly worth trying.
('57', 261, 1, 5, 428952) Try the suggestions I made in my last letter to Narandas.
('57', 261, 1, 6, 429010) Fast for three days or more.
('57', 261, 1, 7, 429039) Take short walks when fasting and do some light work.
('57', 261, 1, 8, 429093) Drink as much water as you can, mixing in it, if necessary, a few drops of sour lemon.
('57', 261, 1, 9, 429180) There will be no harm if you drink with water the juice of two or three lemons in the course of the day.
('57', 261, 1, 10, 429285) Eat or drink nothing else.
('57', 261, 1, 11, 429312) Take an enema every morning.
('57', 261, 1, 12, 429341) Take in 2 pints (2 1/2 lb.) of lukewarm water putting in it 40 grains of soda bicarb and 20 grains of salt.
('57', 261, 1, 13, 429449) Retain the water for 20 minutes if you can.
('57', 261, 1, 14, 429493) You should take the enema lying on the floor.
('57', 261, 1, 15, 429539) If you do not pass stool even then, you may repeat the enema in the evening.
('57', 261, 1, 16, 429616) Do not worry if you still do not pass stool.
('57', 261, 1, 17, 429661) Take an enema in the same way next day.
('57', 261, 1, 18, 429701) Take Kuhnebath at noon.
('57', 261, 1, 19, 429725) If you do not feel too weak and the tongue is still coated, continue the fast.
('57', 261, 1, 20, 429804) If you begin to feel weak, break the fast with fruit juice, such as orange juice, juice of sour lemons with honey, juice of black raisins.
('57', 261, 1, 21, 429943) They should be soaked overnight in water and squeezed the next morning, and the juice should be strained.
('57', 261, 1, 22, 430049) It would be better to warm the juice.
('57', 261, 1, 23, 430087) On the first day drink as much juice as you can.
('57', 261, 1, 24, 430136) You may also eat grapes if you wish.
('57', 261, 1, 25, 430173) The next day you may take bhaji, gourd or some other vegetable.
('57', 261, 1, 26, 430237) Let two days pass in this way.
('57', 261, 1, 27, 430268) Probably, you will pass stool in the natural course.
('57', 261, 1, 28, 430321) If you don’t you may have recourse to the enema again.
('57', 261, 1, 29, 430376) Thereafter begin taking milk.
('57', 261, 1, 30, 430406) Milk may be taken with green vegetables.
('57', 261, 1, 31, 430447) I mix with gourd or pumpkin the milk I wish to take and eat the dish.
('57', 261, 1, 32, 430517) Start bread or rotli only after you begin passing regular stools.
('57', 261, 1, 33, 430583) Fasting in this way will most probably overcome constipation and, in any case, it will do no harm at all.
('57', 261, 1, 34, 430689) If this does not help you, we will think of some other way.
('57', 261, 1, 35, 430749) You are right in deciding not to take the medicine prescribed by Dr. Talwalkar.
('57', 261, 1, 36, 430829) You should not think at all of leaving the Ashram whether at Sabarmati or at Wardha (they are not distinct from each other).
('57', 261, 1, 37, 430954) A person who wishes to serve others, whose thoughts are pure and who works to the best of his ability, should never think that he is a burden on others.
('57', 261, 1, 38, 431107) Write to me regularly and in detail.
('57', 261, 1, 39, 431144) I shall not weary of your letters.
('57', 261, 1, 40, 431179) Carry out with faith whatever measures I suggest from time to time.

('57', 262, 2, 3, 431442) 3 p.m., October 23, 1932
('57', 262, 3, 4, 431467) NARANDAS,
('57', 262, 4, 5, 431477) Ghelabhai’s wire about Punjabhai having passed away reached me yesterday at 9 p.m.
('57', 262, 4, 6, 431560) Who is this Ghelabhai?
('57', 262, 4, 7, 431583) I will expect detailed information about him.
('57', 262, 4, 8, 431629) I am sure all the inmates of the Ashram attended the funeral.
('57', 262, 4, 9, 431691) I will give my reminiscences of Punjabhai in a separate article.
('57', 262, 5, 10, 431756) Read my letter to Champa.
('57', 262, 5, 11, 431782) What is her problem?
('57', 262, 5, 12, 431803) If Kotwal 1
('57', 262, 6, 13, 431815) comes and stays with her, it will certainly be good.
('57', 262, 6, 14, 431868) A letter for him also is enclosed.
('57', 262, 6, 15, 431903) Champa writes in her letter about her desire to go to Rangoon.
('57', 262, 6, 16, 431966) Think over this.
('57', 262, 6, 17, 431983) The Ashram does not seem to be a fortunate place for Jamna.
('57', 262, 6, 18, 432043) She seems to be keeping all right in Rajkot.
('57', 262, 6, 19, 432088) Why, then, should she not continue to live there?
('57', 262, 6, 20, 432138) Those who live outside the Ashram but follow its rules, really live in the Ashram itself.
('57', 262, 6, 21, 432228) On the other hand, those who live in the Ashram but follow its rules unwillingly and only in their letter, and who in their thoughts live outside the Ashram, do not really live in the Ashram.
('57', 262, 6, 22, 432420) It would be far better that Jamna, instead of living in the Ashram and remaining ill all the time, should keep good health outside and do what service she can.
('57', 262, 6, 23, 432580) I am not writing a separate letter to her today.
('57', 262, 6, 24, 432629) But both of you should think over what I have said and do what seems proper.
('57', 262, 6, 25, 432706) I duly got both your postcards regarding Mohan.
('57', 262, 6, 26, 432754) I should have received Anandi’s postcard earlier, but I got it at the same time as yours.
('57', 262, 6, 27, 432844) We should not feel surprised at such things happening here.
('57', 262, 6, 28, 432904) I was glad that Mohan was out of it, soon.
('57', 262, 6, 29, 432947) We should thank God if there is no relapse.
('57', 262, 6, 30, 432991) That Kusum, Navin, Dhiru and Manju, all four of them are ill is a terrible thing.
('57', 262, 6, 31, 433073) I have already explained my ideas conce rning them.
('57', 262, 6, 32, 433125) Do what you think best.
('57', 262, 6, 33, 433149) Read my letter 2 to Bhau.
('57', 262, 6, 34, 433175) That letter made it necessary for me to write to Talwalkar.
('57', 262, 6, 35, 433235) Read the letter which I have written to him also.
('57', 262, 6, 36, 433285) Pass it on to him if you approve it and think it is all right.
('57', 262, 6, 37, 433348) Bhau should see whether the facts are stated correctly.
('57', 262, 6, 38, 433404) If you do not approve of the letter, tear it up.

('57', 263, 1, 5, 433670) Anandi may take the injection.
('57', 263, 1, 6, 433701) I see that your list does include a letter from the Jain muni.
('57', 263, 1, 7, 433764) I had replied to him directly.
('57', 263, 1, 8, 433795) If you have got his address, drop a postcard to him and tell him that I sent a direct reply to him.
('57', 263, 1, 9, 433895) I have advised him not to give up his muni’s dress.
('57', 263, 1, 10, 433947) I don’t remember having seen Ramniklal’s letter.
('57', 263, 1, 11, 433996) It must have been left behind there.

('57', 263, 1, 15, 434191) She is quite cheerful now.
('57', 263, 1, 16, 434218) Her letter had given me the impression that she must have been in a daze during my fast.
('57', 263, 1, 17, 434307) She was of course working, but could not concentrate on anything.
('57', 263, 1, 18, 434373) I see that your list includes a letter from Chhaganlal Joshi also.
('57', 263, 1, 19, 434440) I did not get that letter either.
('57', 263, 1, 20, 434474) I saw your list of primus stoves.
('57', 263, 1, 21, 434508) It took me aback.
('57', 263, 1, 22, 434526) We certainly live in no ordinary style.
('57', 263, 1, 23, 434566) However, it will be enough now if the women agree that only men may light these stoves.
('57', 263, 1, 24, 434654) If they don’t they should be ready to sacrifice one victim at least on the altar of this demon god.
('57', 263, 1, 25, 434754) The Ashram has no licence of exemption from such accident.
('57', 263, 1, 26, 434813) In this age of freedom, I should be satisfied with this warning.
('57', 263, 1, 27, 434878) Read my letter to Lilavati.

('57', 263, 1, 30, 434991) You should certainly be strict.

('57', 263, 1, 32, 435055) If it is absolutely necessary to spend more, he should get your previous permission.
('57', 263, 1, 33, 435140) If there is no provision in his budget for a gardener, I think we should make it.

('57', 264, 1, 2, 435728) 474. LONG LIVE PUNJABHAI!
('57', 264, 2, 3, 435754) [October 23, 1932] 1
('57', 264, 3, 4, 435775) Once when speaking of Punjabhai I had used before his name the prefix chiranjivi 2 a child had asked me in suprise: “Since Punja bhai is older than you, how can you refer to him as chiranjivi?” I had answered somewhat as follows: “In age Punjabhai is certainly older than I, but he trusts me like a child.
('57', 264, 3, 5, 436081) And he offers me even his devotion in the same way.” This was literally true.
('57', 264, 3, 6, 436159) I had my doubts about my fitness for that trust and that devotion.
('57', 264, 3, 7, 436226) But I had not even an iota of doubt about Punjabhai’s trust and devotion to me.
('57', 264, 3, 8, 436306) In any kind of difficulty Punjabhai would accept my advice as gospel truth.
('57', 264, 3, 9, 436382) Punja bhai was not himself without a sense of discrimination but he had deliberately decided to put his trust in me.
('57', 264, 3, 10, 436499) Punjabhai may well not be here today in the sense in which I had addressed him when I called him chiranjivi, but he is chiranjivi in a wider sense than that.
('57', 264, 3, 11, 436657) Though I used to address him as chiranjivi, there was nothing I could teach him.
('57', 264, 3, 12, 436738) I for one was a worshipper of his virtues.
('57', 264, 3, 13, 436781) In my view, no one could surpass Punjabhai in humility, in devotion to religion, in devotion to truth and in generosity.
('57', 264, 3, 14, 436902) Punjabhai had the capacity to sacrifice everything.
('57', 264, 3, 15, 436954) The poet Raichand was all in all to Punjabhai.
('57', 264, 3, 16, 437001) I myself was an admirer of Raichandbhai, so Punjabhai was drawn towards me.
('57', 264, 3, 17, 437077) That I, unlike Punjabhai, could not look upon Raichandbhai as my guru did not pain him.
('57', 264, 3, 18, 437165) Punjabhai knew that no one could become a guru merely by being offered that status.
('57', 264, 3, 19, 437249) A guru attracts a disciple just as a magnet attracts iron.
('57', 264, 3, 20, 437308) Punjabhai greatly liked what I used to say about Raichandbhai and what he liked more was the fact that I tried to assimilate what I extolled.
('57', 264, 3, 21, 437450) As a consequence that bond between us became stronger and stronger every day.
('57', 264, 3, 22, 437528) Punjabhai was closely associated with the Ashram right from itsinception and though he did not become an inmate of the Ashram, He lived as one.
('57', 264, 3, 23, 437672) Punjabhai had shared in the ups and downs of the Ashram.
('57', 264, 3, 24, 437729) He would explain to us the intricacies of the Ahmedabad
('57', 264, 4, 25, 437785) 1 From “Diary, 1932” ; Punjabhai Shah died on October 22. 2 Literally long lived, a term usually applied by people to those younger than themselves

('57', 265, 1, 2, 437975) market.
('57', 265, 1, 3, 437983) He would bring whatever was required.
('57', 265, 1, 4, 438021) We could draft Punjabhai’s men for the service of the Ashram at any time.
('57', 265, 1, 5, 438095) Punja bhai’s shop and house had become the inmates’ place of refuge in the city.
('57', 265, 1, 6, 438176) He would indicate where anything from a broomstick to cereals could be had at a reasonable price.
('57', 265, 1, 7, 438274) The Ashram has saved a lot of money owing to his supervision and his advice.
('57', 265, 1, 8, 438351) It was Punjabhai who found and purchased the piece of land where the Ashram now stands.
('57', 265, 1, 9, 438439) For these and other services he did not ever expect even a few words of thanks.
('57', 265, 1, 10, 438519) Punjabhai worked till his last moment as though the Ashram were his own.
('57', 265, 1, 11, 438592) Though I had occasion to come into very close contact with him, I never found him given to impatience or exage ration at any time.
('57', 265, 1, 12, 438723) He would not speak unless it was necessary.
('57', 265, 1, 13, 438767) How could he ever take part in idle gossip?
('57', 265, 1, 14, 438811) His conversation ever concerned dharma, and he loved to dwell on the lives of virtuous men.
('57', 265, 1, 15, 438903) I never sensed any hatred for anyone in Punjabhai’s heart.
('57', 265, 1, 16, 438962) I never heard him speak harsh words about anyone.
('57', 265, 1, 17, 439012) Punjabhai was skilled in business.
('57', 265, 1, 18, 439047) He earned much.
('57', 265, 1, 19, 439063) He could have earned more had he so desired.
('57', 265, 1, 20, 439108) But it is my impression that after coming into contact with Raichandbhai, he had reduced his business operations.
('57', 265, 1, 21, 439222) His credit was first class.
('57', 265, 1, 22, 439250) The monies kept with him were perfectly secure.
('57', 265, 1, 23, 439298) It was Punjabhai who administerd the finances of the Ashram.
('57', 265, 1, 24, 439359) He was for a long time even the treasurer of the Gujarat Provincial Congress Committee.
('57', 265, 1, 25, 439447) Punjabhai was pious; he aspired for moksha.
('57', 265, 1, 26, 439491) In the Ashram one could count on one’s fingers the men who are as free from covetousness as Punjabhai was.
('57', 265, 1, 27, 439598) Punjabhai’s touch sanctified the Ashram.
('57', 265, 1, 28, 439639) His religion was not narrow.
('57', 265, 1, 29, 439668) It had a place in it for all other faiths.
('57', 265, 1, 30, 439711) Such a man as Punjabhai will live for ever.
('57', 265, 1, 31, 439755) As far as we are concerned, we should remember his virtues and prove worthy of our association with him.

('57', 266, 3, 7, 440116) Where is he lodged?
('57', 266, 3, 8, 440136) I put up with your negligence in writing to me till now.
('57', 266, 3, 9, 440193) I will not do so any longer.
('57', 266, 3, 10, 440222) You should write to me regularly.
('57', 266, 3, 11, 440256) Have you recovered strength now?

('57', 266, 8, 16, 440410) PREMA, I have your letter.
('57', 266, 8, 17, 440437) Jamnadas’s case is a painful one.
('57', 266, 8, 18, 440471) What can we do?
('57', 266, 8, 19, 440487) No one can escape his fate do what he will.
('57', 266, 8, 20, 440531) I had a long letter from Kisan.
('57', 266, 8, 21, 440563) She has given a good description of her daily life.
('57', 266, 8, 22, 440615) Hard work comes so naturally to her that she got up at three in the morning to write that letter.
('57', 266, 8, 23, 440713) I thought I was the only one who worked so hard.
('57', 266, 8, 24, 440762) It seems even girls can humble my pride.
('57', 266, 8, 25, 440803) You cannot do so, for in the Ashram it is a rule that everyone should get up early and so it is not surprising that you should do so.
('57', 266, 8, 26, 440937) In Bombay, however, to get up at six in the morning will be a favour to one’s family.
('57', 266, 8, 27, 441023) This is, of course, not true of labourers.
('57', 266, 8, 28, 441066) But Kisan is not one of them.
('57', 266, 8, 29, 441096) You should, if you can, spare some time and learn the art of ridding the Ashram of its frequent illnesses.
('57', 266, 8, 30, 441203) But your first task is to learn how to make your body strong.
('57', 266, 8, 31, 441265) If maize doesn’t grow on our farms, can we not buy it?
('57', 266, 8, 32, 441320) If that is what you require to increase your weight, the matter is very simple.
('57', 266, 8, 33, 441400) Here in jail they do say that maize gruel helps easy evacuation and increases one’s weight.
('57', 266, 8, 34, 441492) Prisoners always get maize gruel in the morning.
('57', 266, 8, 35, 441541) They add salt to it.
('57', 266, 8, 36, 441562) Bran does not have to be removed frommaize flour.
('57', 266, 8, 37, 441612) It is worth while to make this experiment for a few days for its own sake and feel one with the prisoners.
('57', 266, 8, 38, 441719) What do you
('57', 267, 0, 1, 441731) 268 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 267, 1, 2, 441773) serve in the morning these days?
('57', 267, 1, 3, 441806) If you have been serving wheat gruel as formerly, it should be easy to switch on to jowar gruel.
('57', 267, 1, 4, 441903) The women, Vithal, Kanti and others are familiar with it from experience.
('57', 267, 1, 5, 441977) Their judgment should be final.
('57', 267, 1, 6, 442009) I am only writing what I hear from others.
('57', 267, 1, 7, 442052) I did not follow anything of what Shanta said.
('57', 267, 1, 8, 442099) She has told me nothing.
('57', 267, 1, 9, 442124) It would be good if she confided in you.
('57', 267, 1, 10, 442165) Now that I remember, ‘confides’ is an English word.
('57', 267, 1, 11, 442217) The Gujarati idiom is ‘to open out the heart’.
('57', 267, 1, 12, 442264) If Shanta wants anything to be kept confidential, you should certainly respect her wishes.
('57', 267, 1, 13, 442355) I cannot just now answer the questions which you have put to me.
('57', 267, 1, 14, 442420) Have patience for some time.
('57', 267, 1, 15, 442449) There is no limit to your capacity and fitness for work.
('57', 267, 1, 16, 442506) But these can be seen only if I give you an opportunity to display them.
('57', 267, 1, 17, 442579) For the time being they waste their sweetness on the desert air like the flowers in Gray’s poem 1 .
('57', 267, 1, 18, 442679) Our cat was really mad with joy when she saw us.
('57', 267, 1, 19, 442728) She simply would not leave us.
('57', 267, 1, 20, 442759) She must have keenly felt the separation from us.
('57', 267, 1, 21, 442809) She is contented now.

('57', 268, 3, 7, 443790) You should do only as much work as you can without getting exhausted.
('57', 268, 3, 8, 443860) Do not worry about anything.
('57', 268, 3, 9, 443889) I do not know of any complaint having been made to me against you.

('57', 268, 8, 20, 444540) My companions also are not men who would gladly eat whatever fruit they are given.
('57', 268, 8, 21, 444623) They, too, wish to observe the restrictons proper for prisoners and for human beings in general.
('57', 268, 8, 22, 444720) Hence it seems improper on my part to let you send me fruit in a continous stream.
('57', 268, 8, 23, 444803) Let me, therefore, have my own way about fruit as I had about honey.
('57', 268, 8, 24, 444872) I shall ask for it as and when I need it.
('57', 268, 8, 25, 444914) The pomegranates which you sent are enough for me just now, and the oranges and the apples brought by Manilal are also there.
('57', 268, 8, 26, 445040) I will trouble you when all this stock is exhausted.
('57', 268, 8, 27, 445093) I have written to Trivedi about honey.
('57', 268, 8, 28, 445132) I have sent him a letter

('57', 269, 0, 1, 445178) 270 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 269, 1, 2, 445220) from a friend named David.
('57', 269, 1, 3, 445247) You may read that letter.
('57', 269, 1, 4, 445273) I have no choice but to give up the use of wild honey.
('57', 269, 1, 5, 445328) Mr. David’s letter gives a vivid description of the sin of consuming such honey.
('57', 269, 1, 6, 445409) I am sure one must be able to get innocent honey in some part of India.
('57', 269, 1, 7, 445481) If we cannot get it, I think we ourselves should arrange with some people to produce it.
('57', 269, 1, 8, 445570) You will get a clearer idea of all this if you read Mr. David’s letter.
('57', 269, 1, 9, 445642) However, drop the matter if you do not feel interested in it.
('57', 269, 1, 10, 445704) I don’t wish to give you unnecessary trouble.
('57', 269, 1, 11, 445750) These facts are worth knowing only if one is interested in the subject.
('57', 269, 1, 12, 445822) Ba has told me much about your kindness and love.
('57', 269, 1, 13, 445872) But, to be able to accept all that love without hesitation, I must have a strong desire to serve humanity.

('57', 269, 6, 20, 446226) You have refrained from remarrying out of your own volition.
('57', 269, 6, 21, 446287) You have come to the Ashram on your own.
('57', 269, 6, 22, 446328) You will rise by your own strength.
('57', 269, 6, 23, 446364) Therefore, do whatever you think proper.
('57', 269, 6, 24, 446405) Come to the Ashram and stay there as if it was your father’s house.
('57', 269, 6, 25, 446473) Of course, even in one’s father’s house rules must be followed.
('57', 269, 6, 26, 446537) You can consider yourself totally free and leave the Ashram.
('57', 269, 6, 27, 446598) Whatever you do, do after due consideration.
('57', 269, 6, 28, 446643) I regard Mridu’s company as satsang for you.

('57', 270, 15, 20, 447598) DEAR COL.
('57', 270, 15, 21, 447608) DOYLE, Your communication regarding my request 2 for a definition of Government policy about my interviewing and carrying on corres pondence in the matter of untouchability and another matter was read to me by Major Bhandari this morning.
('57', 270, 15, 22, 447847) I was allowed to make a copy of it.
('57', 270, 15, 23, 447883) According to the communication, “Government are prepared to allow me a reasonable number of interviews (with persons approved
('57', 270, 16, 24, 448009) 1 Vide “Telegram to Abul Kalam Azad”, 20 10 1932. 2 Vide “Letter to E.E. Doyle”, 6 10 1932.

('57', 271, 1, 3, 448262) It is clear to me that Government could not be aware that my fast is only suspended and that may have to be resumed if the work of removal of untouchability is not thoroughly done.
('57', 271, 1, 4, 448443) Moreover, so far as a temple in the South is concerned, I might be obliged to join Sjt.
('57', 271, 1, 5, 448531) Kelappan in his fast, if by or before the 2nd of January next that temple is not opened to the so called untouchables.
('57', 271, 1, 6, 448650) This the Government has known.
('57', 271, 1, 7, 448681) Three weeks have already passed without mybeing able to do much work, apart from being permitted after long delay to send two telegrams.
('57', 271, 1, 8, 448818) Despatch and publicity are essential, if I am to overtake the work of reform in due time.
('57', 271, 1, 9, 448908) Every day counts.
('57', 271, 1, 10, 448926) I therefore submit that all restrictions on the choice of visitors and publication of correspondence should be removed.
('57', 271, 1, 11, 449046) I can have no objection to the presence of an official or officials at the interviews and inspection there and then of correspondence.
('57', 271, 1, 12, 449181) If assistance is supplied to me, the Government may have copies of all corres pondence and short hand notes of interviews.
('57', 271, 1, 13, 449304) Naturally these inter views and correspondence should have no reference to civil diso bedience and must be strictly limitied to the removal of untou chability.
('57', 271, 1, 14, 449464) Unless therefore these restrictions, as submitted above, are removed, before the 1st November next, I shall be reluctantly obliged to withdraw, subject to the limitations imposed by the law of satyagraha, such co operation as is possible for me to do.
('57', 271, 1, 15, 449716) And as a preliminiary I shall deny myself all the feeding facilities permitted to me and restrict myself to such ‘C’ class diet as I can within my vow consistenly take and so long as my body can accommodate itself to such food.
('57', 271, 1, 16, 449944) I do hope the Government will not regard this as a threat.
('57', 271, 1, 17, 450003) The contemplated step is the natural consequence of the Government attitude.
('57', 271, 1, 18, 450080) I can have no interest in life if I cannot prosecute, without let or hindrance, work for which the fast was undertaken and suspended.
('57', 271, 1, 19, 450214) I would have said nothing if this moral and religious reform had anything to do with civil disobedience.
('57', 271, 1, 20, 450319) With reference to my personal letter 1 to the Honourable Mr. Hudson, the reply comes upon me as a painful surprise.
('57', 271, 1, 21, 450435) If the warning read out to me at the interview with Dr. Ambedkar was by way of

('57', 272, 1, 2, 450607) punishment for what I am alleged to have done regarding the telegram to Maulana Shaukat Ali, common justice even to a prisoner demanded that the cause of the punishment should have been conveyed to me at the time of the warning, and before the punishment was pronounced explanation should have been called for from me.
('57', 272, 1, 3, 450926) I never knew that a prisoner could be condemned unheard.
('57', 272, 1, 4, 450983) Nor had I the remotest idea that the letter to my son which I had seen was intended to convey any warning to me.
('57', 272, 1, 5, 451096) Let me say that my son told me definitely in offical presence that Mr. Hudson had in a generous manner not only quickly granted him permission to see me as often as he liked but that he had permitted him to talk to me about anything and carry any messages from me, so long as he gave no interviews to the Press and published nothing.
('57', 272, 1, 6, 451430) In view of this conversation I saw nothing wrong in asking my son to tell Mr. Shaukat Ali that I had seen his wire and that I had replied to it, and that he was likely to receive the reply in the course of a day or two, the delay being due to the fact that it had gone to the Government for being passed.
('57', 272, 1, 7, 451735) I had not then the remotest idea that the utterly innocent telegram would not be passed.
('57', 272, 1, 8, 451824) I did therefore give my son also the purport of the reply.
('57', 272, 1, 9, 451883) Let me however correct two mis statements in the paragraph of your communication regarding this matter.
('57', 272, 1, 10, 451987) I had no knowledge at the time of talking to my son that the telegram had not been “passed for transmission”.
('57', 272, 1, 11, 452097) Nor is it correct to say that the text of the reply has been published in the Press.
('57', 272, 1, 12, 452182) What I have seen is only the substance.
('57', 272, 1, 13, 452222) I did not give my son a copy of the reply.
('57', 272, 1, 14, 452265) I add that my son out of nobility of his nature wrote a gentlemanly letter to Mr. Hudson regretting that Maulana Shaukat Ali had published his conversation with him in spite of his caution.
('57', 272, 1, 15, 452455) He had expected a letter of thanks in reply for his frankness but unfortunately he received a reprimand, and he remained quiet under it.
('57', 272, 1, 16, 452592) I should be sorry if after this very full explanation Mr. Hudson does not revise his opinion and think that as man to man he has done me a grave injustice.
('57', 272, 2, 17, 452748) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI
('57', 272, 3, 18, 452778) [PS.] Since it is obviously impossible for me to guarantee non publication by my correspondents, known and unknown, of letters I may write to them, whilst the bar referred to lasts, I have to suspend what correspondence on untouchability I have hitherto carried on.

('57', 273, 5, 8, 453360) RUKMINI, As my elbow needs rest, I am now dictating my letters.
('57', 273, 5, 9, 453424) You have married a well known man indeed!
('57', 273, 5, 10, 453466) For there is only one ‘Bazaj’ family in Banaras, and it is so famous that the mere word ‘Bazaj’ is enough for a letter to reach.
('57', 273, 5, 11, 453595) Do you know how much that increases your responsibility?
('57', 273, 5, 12, 453652) Having been married into such a family, you have to shine with the power of your character and enhance the prestige of the family too.
('57', 273, 5, 13, 453787) May God give you the strength to do so.
('57', 273, 5, 14, 453827) What good fortune that you got a medal at the blessed hands of Malaviyaji!
('57', 273, 5, 15, 453902) If the sitar is not in order, get it repaired.
('57', 273, 5, 16, 453949) You should not get out of practice.
('57', 273, 5, 17, 453985) Your cough will have gone by the time you get this letter.
('57', 273, 5, 18, 454044) It is easy to cure it.
('57', 273, 5, 19, 454067) For a day or two, take every one or two hours some hot water—just bearably hot—with a small teaspoonful of lemon juice and as much clean salt as you can tolerate.
('57', 273, 5, 20, 454230) The cough will subside in only one day if it has not become chronic.
('57', 273, 5, 21, 454299) But you should eat nothing whatever for that day.
('57', 273, 5, 22, 454349) Take an enema if you do not get a clear motion on that day.
('57', 273, 5, 23, 454409) The next day you may take milk and sweet grapes or musambis.

('57', 273, 8, 28, 454794) We are after full consideration recommending to His Majesty’s Government that Gandhi should be allowed complete freedom in regard to visitors and correspondence on matters strictly confined to removal of untouchability and that there should be no restriction on publicity.
('57', 273, 8, 29, 455067) Conditions suggested by Gandhiji himself about right to have official present at interviews and inspection of correspondence would be accepted, though it might not be necessary to enforce them.
('57', 273, 8, 30, 455261) Meantime we regard it as of utmost impor tance that in these conditions Gandhi should not start restriction of his diet.

('57', 274, 2, 3, 455460) October 24, 1932 The comparison with Banabhatta and Valmiki is not right.
('57', 274, 2, 4, 455534) 1 One may compare the two types of yarn with “Balakanda” and “Kishkindhakanda,” or better still, with “Kishkindhakanda” and “Uttarkanda”.
('57', 274, 2, 5, 455672) Fine yarn of 200 counts or more is “Uttarkanda” in the absence of which “Kishkindhakanda” would lose all value.
('57', 274, 2, 6, 455784) Our forefathers forced the poor to produce Dacca Shabnam 2 to gratify the delicate tastes of people who loved luxury.
('57', 274, 2, 7, 455902) Let us atone for their sin by spinning as yajna yarn of the finest count and offer it to the Lord.
('57', 274, 2, 8, 456001) The art in both cases is the same, but in olden times it ministered to selfishness.
('57', 274, 2, 9, 456085) Let our art help in spreading the spirit of service, it is necessary to revive the old skill in order to popularize khadi among all classes of people.
('57', 274, 2, 10, 456236) We should prove that what was possible then in the days of slavery can be done in the age of freedom too.
('57', 274, 2, 11, 456342) Will not the devotee do for God what a libertine would do for a prostitute?
('57', 274, 2, 12, 456418) This involves neither great trouble nor any expense; for, all that we wish to do is to learn slowly to spin fine yarn in a spirit of self sacrifice.
('57', 274, 2, 13, 456567) I have also found from experience that, if we try to spin finer and finer yarn, we shall more likely discover ways of producing better and cheaper khadi.
('57', 274, 2, 14, 456721) Here we have the practical application of the Gita verse beginning with “Yavanartha udapane” .
('57', 274, 2, 15, 456816) If this reasoning appeals to you, I need not explain to you why I put down 20 counts as the minimum for a voluntary spinner to achieve.
('57', 274, 2, 16, 456952) There is however nothing sacrosanct about this figure; it is not laid down as a rigid rule.
('57', 274, 2, 17, 457044) It is only a test of the devotion of the voluntary spinner.
('57', 274, 2, 18, 457104) An institution must lay down some such rule.
('57', 274, 2, 19, 457149) Drawing out any sort of yarn should not pass for yajna.
('57', 274, 2, 20, 457205) There ought to be some rule, some standard.
('57', 274, 2, 21, 457249) If this is admitted, then 20 counts is
('57', 274, 3, 22, 457288) .inform him immediately that his letters only reached Government of India yesterday, that the matter is under closest consideration, and that we hope to communicate decision within two or three days.

('57', 274, 3, 25, 457762) He had compared coarse yarn with Valmiki’s Ramayana and fine yarn with Banabhatta’s Kadambari.
('57', 274, 3, 26, 457857) He had also mentioned the difficulties one had to face in the villages.

('57', 275, 1, 2, 458014) not a high requirement.
('57', 275, 1, 3, 458038) A voluntary spinner should not spin as if he was doing forced labour.
('57', 275, 1, 4, 458108) He should enrich his yajna with devotion and art and beauty, identifying himself with the work, that which is offered as sacrifice should be of the purest quality, shoudn’t it?
('57', 275, 2, 5, 458285) If I have not been able to explain my point of view, you may write to me again and ask me.
('57', 275, 2, 6, 458376) I have no doubt in the matter, but I cannot rest at ease till I have satisfied you.
('57', 275, 2, 7, 458460) The problem of working in the villages is a very difficult one.
('57', 275, 2, 8, 458524) We need not worry what the smriti has to say regarding onions.
('57', 275, 2, 9, 458587) We should go by our experience.
('57', 275, 2, 10, 458619) As medicine, they are good.
('57', 275, 2, 11, 458647) I have tried them very often.
('57', 275, 2, 12, 458677) I also dislike their odour and generally do not eat them, though I certainly would if I found it necessary.
('57', 275, 2, 13, 458785) One may eat them with the last meal of the day, for one meets few people thereafter.
('57', 275, 2, 14, 458870) If eaten in small quantities as medicine, the odour will probably be less acute.
('57', 275, 2, 15, 458951) If we cannot get cow’s milk anywhere at all, I would say that the country is heading towards bankruptcy.
('57', 275, 2, 16, 459056) If a person touring villages carried with him mawa of cow’s milk, he would get both ghee and protein in it and, if he should dissolve the powdered mawa in hot water, it would then be as good as milk.
('57', 275, 2, 17, 459256) I do not suggest the addition of sugar or jaggery to the mawa, since, in the first place, that is not necessary and, secondly, it may mean indulging the palate.
('57', 275, 2, 18, 459417) Thus, one can live on rotlas 1, pendas 2, onions and tamarind or sour lemon.
('57', 275, 2, 19, 459494) Public workers should not have their dinner late in the evening.
('57', 275, 2, 20, 459559) The only things which they may accept from the village people are rotlas and onions, or they may cook their own food.
('57', 275, 2, 21, 459677) Wherever they go, they should boil water for their use and drink only that.
('57', 275, 2, 22, 459753) This way they will not have to depend on others, and no one will be put to trouble as nothing will have to be specially prepared for them.
('57', 275, 2, 23, 459892) They should sleep in the open, accepting if available a charpoy to keep themselves, so far as is humanly possible, safe from the danger of snakes etc.
('57', 275, 2, 24, 460043) I am giving all this advice without experience of course.
('57', 275, 2, 25, 460101) I know that the facilities which were offered to me in the villages may not be available to others.
('57', 275, 2, 26, 460201) Follow from this whatever is practicable and desirable, and reject the rest.
('57', 275, 2, 27, 460278) I have made all these suggestions so that you may be prompted to think more about the problem.
('57', 275, 2, 28, 460373) I realize very well how exceedingly difficult it is to go into the villages.
('57', 275, 2, 29, 460450) However,

('57', 276, 1, 2, 460597) despite the difficulties, we must go.
('57', 276, 1, 3, 460635) I therefore, very much like the beginning you are making.
('57', 276, 1, 4, 460693) Every public worker ought to have some knowledge of simple remedies.

('57', 276, 4, 9, 460896) BHAISHRI KHAMBHATTA, I got your letter.
('57', 276, 4, 10, 460936) Since the pain in the elbow has returned, I have again started dictating as many of the letters as I can to give rest to my arm.
('57', 276, 4, 11, 461065) None of us was scared by your letter in which you spoke of “blue brain”.
('57', 276, 4, 12, 461138) I had not the least idea what “blue brain” was and as I had been lying under a tree when your letter came, I said: “Who knows what ‘blue brain’ is!
('57', 276, 4, 13, 461286) But living under a tree might cause ‘green brain’, and it would certainly be good to have it.” Thus we had some fun about it, as I showed no symptom at all of what you feared.
('57', 276, 4, 14, 461462) And we have more cause for fun now that we can understand how you came to have the fear.
('57', 276, 4, 15, 461551) There is absolutely no reason why I should not let myself be examined by Bhai Mehta.
('57', 276, 4, 16, 461636) I would like him to examine me and make some suggestions.
('57', 276, 4, 17, 461694) Why should not I learn from Mehta, when I am always ready to learn from anybody who has something to give?
('57', 276, 4, 18, 461801) But the truth is that I would have to obtain special permission to get myself examined by him, and I am really afraid I would not get such permission if I asked for it.
('57', 276, 4, 19, 461970) I do not ask the permission to spare myself the shock of the refusal.
('57', 276, 4, 20, 462040) However, I would certainly think about whatever suggestions he sends in writting on the basis of any likely causes that occur to him.
('57', 276, 4, 21, 462174) Like him, I also believe that disease is lurking somewhere in me, despite all the self control I exercise, and that the disease expresses itself through the pain in the elbow or otherwise.
('57', 276, 4, 22, 462363) The bowels certainly are weak.
('57', 276, 4, 23, 462394) After all I have not been a man of self control all my life.
('57', 276, 4, 24, 462455) I lived a life of self indulgence for a number of years, and who can measure the self indulgence that must have mixed with self control after I consiously started to lead such a life?
('57', 276, 4, 25, 462639) It would be very good indeed if both of you could go to a quiet place.
('57', 276, 4, 26, 462710) Do not fight nature.

('57', 277, 3, 4, 462927) DEAR COL.
('57', 277, 3, 5, 462937) DOYLE, I thank you for your letter of 24th inst.
('57', 277, 3, 6, 462986) I appreciate your assurance about the health of my several friends.
('57', 277, 3, 7, 463054) But you will perhaps agree that it does not give the same satisfaction as a personal letter.
('57', 277, 3, 8, 463147) So far as Sjt.
('57', 277, 3, 9, 463162) N. D. Parikh is concerned, my letter was sent during the fast and you are under promise to get me a letter from him in reply as you were good enough to secure from others.
('57', 277, 3, 10, 463334) So far as Shrimati Manibehn Patel is concerned, her ordinary letter is overdue.
('57', 277, 3, 11, 463414) She unfailingly writes either to Sardar Vallabhbhai or to me, and neither of us has heard from her.
('57', 277, 3, 12, 463514) As for Swami Anand’s letter, I can only rely upon your goodwill.
('57', 277, 3, 13, 463579) There is no letter due from him in the ordinary course.
('57', 277, 3, 14, 463635) If, therefore, you do not mind, I would like to know whether I may have the promised reply sent by Sjt.

('57', 277, 8, 23, 464094) I have almost regained my normal health.
('57', 277, 8, 24, 464135) I go through the usual daily routine without much difficulty.
('57', 277, 8, 25, 464197) We all feel glad that your son has nearly recovered and that his injuries were not so serious as they were reported in the Press.

('57', 278, 3, 4, 464847) MY DEAR PLAYMATE AND SLAVE, I was shocked to hear from Devdas about the accident.
('57', 278, 3, 5, 464929) You have to be a good girl and a better slave and listen to the slave driver.
('57', 278, 3, 6, 465007) You must go to the hospital and be properly treated there.
('57', 278, 3, 7, 465066) Do not consider Father and Mother to be so soft as to be shaken to bits by a very simple an necessary act.
('57', 278, 3, 8, 465173) After all your own bravery is surely derived from them.
('57', 278, 3, 9, 465229) I therefore expect a reply to this from the hospital.
('57', 278, 3, 10, 465283) You should do as Devdas says.
('57', 278, 3, 11, 465313) He is very good and very noble about such services.
('57', 278, 3, 12, 465365) May God be with you and keep you.

('57', 278, 9, 22, 465702) Sushila and Tara can also come.
('57', 278, 9, 23, 465734) Surendra too.
('57', 278, 9, 24, 465748) Has he not lived in the Ashram?
('57', 278, 9, 25, 465780) Moreover, being related to your father in law, he is a relation of ours as well.
('57', 278, 9, 26, 465861) There should not be more than five at a time.
('57', 278, 9, 27, 465907) Your tour of Madras, etc., should start soon.
('57', 278, 9, 28, 465953) The account of the interview with you which has appeared in newspapers does not seem to be correct.
('57', 278, 9, 29, 466053) If you have not seen it, do so.
('57', 278, 9, 30, 466085) It has appeared in The Hindu.
('57', 278, 9, 31, 466115) I hope you have fully recovered now.

('57', 279, 4, 8, 466458) October 25, 1932 We must not look upon young men and women with suspicion.
('57', 279, 4, 9, 466533) We must not deliberately tempt them.
('57', 279, 4, 10, 466570) Here there is no such thing.
('57', 279, 4, 11, 466599) 1 is careful.
('57', 279, 4, 12, 466613) He is not a young boy any more; he is about thirty two.
('57', 279, 4, 13, 466669) too is a sensible girl and .
('57', 279, 4, 14, 466698) 2 has a commendable habit.
('57', 279, 4, 15, 466725) He hides nothing from me; if he is a prey to passion he confesses it to me.
('57', 279, 4, 16, 466801) Their relationship, therefore, causes me no anxiety.
('57', 279, 4, 17, 466854) I am to some extent acquainted with the Roman Catholic injunctions.
('57', 279, 4, 18, 466922) Our experiment is unique, it is open to many risks.
('57', 279, 4, 19, 466974) It is also not in conformity with the prevalent atmosphere in India.
('57', 279, 4, 20, 467043) But the service we want to render to the women of India and the freedom that we want for them, are not possible without incurring risks.
('57', 279, 4, 21, 467180) We must proceed fearlessly, cautiously, and with faith in God.
('57', 279, 4, 22, 467243) And this is why we must be very careful in choosing the Ashram manager.
('57', 279, 4, 23, 467315) In my judgment we cannot find a purer, more patient, disciplined and balanced person than Narandas.
('57', 279, 4, 24, 467415) As long as he is there, I need not worry.

('57', 280, 2, 5, 468160) But who knows whether it is for your well being 1
('57', 280, 3, 6, 468210) that you have had this attack leaving you completely prostrate.
('57', 280, 3, 7, 468274) And since we are so hopelessly ignorant as to the truth of things, I suppose the Gita teaches us to be equi minded, no matter what fate overtakes us.
('57', 280, 3, 8, 468424) So on the one hand we have to learn to be equi minded, and on the other we have to apply natural remedies within our means in order to get well when we are ill.

('57', 280, 6, 15, 468871) Some of them are penetrating.
('57', 280, 6, 16, 468901) The quotation about Chrirstianity is of a different order.
('57', 280, 6, 17, 468960) It hardly does justice to the Christian doctrine.
('57', 280, 6, 18, 469010) Sonship has no literal meaning.
('57', 280, 6, 19, 469042) Nor does trinity mean three gods.

('57', 280, 6, 24, 469254) I pour my milk over the vegetable which is just now alternatively marrow and pumpkin.
('57', 280, 6, 25, 469340) These are the only two vegetables to be had just now in the prison garden.
('57', 280, 6, 26, 469415) And I try to restrict myself just to the vegetables grown there.
('57', 280, 6, 27, 469480) They seem to suit the body quite well.

('57', 280, 6, 31, 469656) The seven years seem like a dream.

('57', 280, 6, 33, 469737) And I derive such comfort as is possible from the fact that it was love that was scolding; but I know that there was a

('57', 281, 1, 2, 469969) better way.
('57', 281, 1, 3, 469981) As I look back upon the past I realize that my love was impatient.
('57', 281, 1, 4, 470048) To that extent it was ignorant.
('57', 281, 1, 5, 470080) Enlightened love is ever patient.
('57', 281, 1, 6, 470114) Ignorant love is a crude translation of the word moha in Sanskrit.
('57', 281, 1, 7, 470181) I shall learn to be patient.
('57', 281, 1, 8, 470210) As I watch myself in little things, I know that I have not yet acquired that measure of patience which true love demands.
('57', 281, 1, 9, 470332) That patience shall come.
('57', 281, 1, 10, 470358) You remember Shanti, the Chinese young man?
('57', 281, 1, 11, 470402) I had a wire from him during the fast and now I have a penitent letter from him.
('57', 281, 1, 12, 470483) Poor boy!
('57', 281, 1, 13, 470493) He could not keep his vows and so kept silent.
('57', 281, 1, 14, 470540) He is father of many children.
('57', 281, 1, 15, 470571) He gives a desolate picture of China and is impatient to come back to India by way of penance for the past.
('57', 281, 1, 16, 470679) His English has improved wonderfully.
('57', 281, 1, 17, 470717) Devdas was here yesterday.
('57', 281, 1, 18, 470744) He is much better.
('57', 281, 1, 19, 470763) Pyarelal obstinately refuses to take milk and butter and confines himself to oil.
('57', 281, 1, 20, 470845) Fruit too he will not take.
('57', 281, 1, 21, 470873) The result is that he has a sore throat.
('57', 281, 1, 22, 470914) I have asked him not to be so obstinate.

('57', 281, 1, 24, 470977) Sushila is also better.
('57', 281, 1, 25, 471001) And Ba will be going to the Ashram.
('57', 281, 1, 26, 471037) She was anxious to see you.
('57', 281, 1, 27, 471065) But I weaned her.

('57', 281, 4, 33, 471358) If you analyse each word of the Gita in detail and reflect over its meaning, that itself will give you more than enough strength.
('57', 281, 4, 34, 471488) That is what I find happens to me.
('57', 281, 4, 35, 471523) Do you try and understand the Gita in the original Sanskrit?
('57', 281, 4, 36, 471584) Do you study Sanskrit?
('57', 281, 4, 37, 471607) Among other books, Tolstoy’s essays.
('57', 281, 4, 38, 471644) Imitation of Christ is worth reading.
('57', 281, 4, 39, 471682) You must read an account of the life of the Buddha, and The Light of Asia 1, if you can understand it.
('57', 281, 4, 40, 471785) It will of course be very good if you read the Ramayana.
('57', 281, 4, 41, 471842) There is a booklet in Hindi entitled Brahmachayra which is very good.
('57', 281, 4, 42, 471912) If you wish to read it, I will get it from the Ashram and

('57', 282, 1, 2, 472042) send it to you.
('57', 282, 1, 3, 472058) There is a collection of articles by me entitled Nitinashne Marge, 1 which also is worth reading.
('57', 282, 1, 4, 472156) For the present, this reading list is enough.
('57', 282, 1, 5, 472202) Instead of worrying how you will be able to carry out your resolution, tell yourself that you are bound to succeed in carrying it out and that God will help you.
('57', 282, 1, 6, 472364) Fix this thought firmly in your mind and keep yourself absorbed in your work.
('57', 282, 1, 7, 472442) Do not be impatient even in reading.
('57', 282, 1, 8, 472479) If you do not follow anything, read it over again.
('57', 282, 1, 9, 472530) It does not matter if this takes more time.
('57', 282, 1, 10, 472574) Even if you do not remember what you read, do not brood; always remain cheerful.
('57', 282, 1, 11, 472655) Do not worry however slow your progress is.
('57', 282, 1, 12, 472699) One day you will find everything easy.
('57', 282, 1, 13, 472738) Do not do anything at the cost of your health.
('57', 282, 1, 14, 472785) Put only as much burden on your mind as it can bear.
('57', 282, 1, 15, 472838) Your eagerness about the children is right.
('57', 282, 1, 16, 472882) But you need not worry about them right now.
('57', 282, 1, 17, 472927) Just now it is necessary that they should improve in health and become very strong.
('57', 282, 1, 18, 473011) For that we require Nimu’s co operation.
('57', 282, 1, 19, 473052) I will write to her about them.
('57', 282, 1, 20, 473084) Recently, I have been getting her letters fairly regularly.
('57', 282, 1, 21, 473144) You also should write to her often.
('57', 282, 1, 22, 473180) If their bodies become strong and if they grow up in a healthy atmosphere, they will automatically become what you want them to become.
('57', 282, 1, 23, 473316) You are of course right when you say that you two should exercise self control at least for their sake.
('57', 282, 1, 24, 473420) What pure education means, how it can be imparted and what kind of education will suit the present age, all this requires careful thinking.
('57', 282, 1, 25, 473560) But there is plenty of time for that.
('57', 282, 1, 26, 473598) You may ask me any questions which occur to you concerning these problems.
('57', 282, 1, 27, 473673) If you wish, I will send you a short note which may help you.
('57', 282, 1, 28, 473735) I suppose Surendra is busily occupied with his shoemaking.
('57', 282, 1, 29, 473794) Tell him that God may be found even in shoes and the leather of dead cattle.
('57', 282, 1, 30, 473871) The leather for soles which I recently received was excellent.
('57', 282, 1, 31, 473934) I see in it God in a beautiful form.
('57', 282, 1, 32, 473971) He is not to be found only in scriptures.
('57', 282, 1, 33, 474013) Ask Surendra to explain to you the story of Tuladhar, and let him also reflect again over its meaning.
('57', 282, 1, 34, 474116) It is not necessary to search for Him in inaccessible places.
('57', 282, 1, 35, 474178) We carry Him under our arm, but, forgetting that, we go about the whole town looking for Him.
('57', 282, 1, 36, 474272) When at last we remember that He is in our arm, we weep and laugh over our foolishness.

('57', 283, 3, 6, 474680) And as you are allowed to do more reading, the time is drawing near when you will also be permitted to leave the bed.

('57', 283, 7, 12, 475078) October 26, 1932
('57', 283, 8, 13, 475095) MATHURADAS, This time I was waiting for a letter from you every day and wondering why there was none, when I got it.
('57', 283, 8, 14, 475212) You have caught the point regarding the testing of yarn.
('57', 283, 8, 15, 475269) An understanding of such practical aspects saves us much time.
('57', 283, 8, 16, 475332) Some of the methods followed by the mills are devised with a purely commercial aim and some others to help in mass production.
('57', 283, 8, 17, 475459) These methods are of no use to us in our rural industry, though some of them do deserve to be adopted by us too.
('57', 283, 8, 18, 475572) We have to use our discrimination and judge which ones we should adopt.
('57', 283, 8, 19, 475644) I suggest that Mahadev’s fine yarn may be passed through doubling before weaving, if you feel that it is unfit for weaving only becuase of its lack of strength.
('57', 283, 8, 20, 475805) If you think, however that we do not have the type of rach and heddles required to weave such fine yarn, we should manufacture them.
('57', 283, 8, 21, 475938) Perhaps Ramji’s experience may not help us much in this matter as he may not have the intelligence necessary for dealing with yarn of such fine count.
('57', 283, 8, 22, 476089) To get this yarn woven, you should approach other skilled workers in
('57', 283, 9, 23, 476158) 1 Son of Vallabhbhai Patel
('57', 284, 0, 1, 476185) VOL. 57 : 5 SEPTEMBER, 1932 15 NOVEMBER, 1932 285
('57', 284, 1, 2, 476235) Ahmedabad who weave very fine cloth.
('57', 284, 1, 3, 476272) Again, it is likely that the method for testing the strength of very fine yarn is a different one, and the tools for that purpose and also the knocker required for weaving fine yarn must be especially delicate so that there is the least possible strain on the yarn.
('57', 284, 1, 4, 476538) The method of starching fine yarn must also be different.
('57', 284, 1, 5, 476596) It is likely, however, that the skilled weavers in Ahmedabad weave only fine silk yarn and do not know enough about very fine cotton yarn.
('57', 284, 1, 6, 476735) If that is so, we should procure the necessary tools from Andhradesha or Bengal where they weave very fine yarn, or we may send to them a specimen of our yarn and inquire about the method of weaving it.
('57', 284, 1, 7, 476938) Have you seen the Andhra weavers at work?
('57', 284, 1, 8, 476980) Did you observe the starching and other processes which they demonstrated at our exhibitions?
('57', 284, 1, 9, 477074) But I think that after reading what I have written you yourself will be able to find a better solution.
('57', 284, 1, 10, 477178) We must acquire the skill to weave our finest yarn ourselves in the Ashram.
('57', 284, 1, 11, 477254) You will perhaps be able to see from all this that only voluntary spinners can fully master all aspects of the art of spinning and that, when we have mastered it, it will be quite easy for us to produce ordinary khadi of the best possible quality.
('57', 284, 1, 12, 477502) You will also see, if you cast a glance at other crafts and skills, that when the people themselves had not learnt the required skill the craft remained poor, and that it was only amateurs who became experts in it.
('57', 284, 1, 13, 477717) It is because our people neglected hand spinning that the country lost a cottage industry which gave work to millions in their homes.
('57', 284, 1, 14, 477851) Now the craft can be revived as an occupation only if we do hard tapascharya and cultivate the art once again in a spirit of yajna.
('57', 284, 1, 15, 477983) Looking at the matter from this point of view, I was very happy that you had finally decided to cling to your work and overcome your restlessness.
('57', 284, 1, 16, 478130) Keshu’s carding bow will of course be useful.
('57', 284, 1, 17, 478176) As it cannot be installed in a village home, the old carding bow will remain as the old spinning wheel has remained.
('57', 284, 1, 18, 478293) The best thing to do is to make improvements in it, and I believe that such improvements are possible.
('57', 284, 1, 19, 478396) Mirabehn has been working fairly hard with that aim.
('57', 284, 1, 20, 478449) She has been carding in jail too, and has made some improvements.
('57', 284, 1, 21, 478515) You are quite right in applying yourself to that task.
('57', 284, 1, 22, 478570) Your test report on the yarn spun by both of us will help us very much.
('57', 284, 1, 23, 478642) I saw the justice of most of your criticism.
('57', 284, 1, 24, 478687) I myself have observed the defects which you have pointed out, but I ignore them sometimes when I am tired.
('57', 284, 1, 25, 478795) I often observe that the yarn is rough because of an occasional bad sliver or because of uneven tension
('57', 285, 0, 1, 478899) 286 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 285, 1, 2, 478941) when spinning.
('57', 285, 1, 3, 478956) Instead of cutting off and taking out that part, I let it pass.
('57', 285, 1, 4, 479020) I do know that this will mean a lot of trouble for the weaver, and that, therefore, by letting that yarn remain I also commit violence.
('57', 285, 1, 5, 479156) However, while I am actually spinning, partly through lack of vigilance at the time, partly through greed, partly through lethargy and partly through fatigue I may ignore defects in the yarn.
('57', 285, 1, 6, 479348) But now that I have received your criticism, I know that the quality of my yarn will automatically improve.
('57', 285, 1, 7, 479456) If, therefore, I receive further criticism when the yarn is woven, it will certainly help both Mahadev and me, for both of us wish to spin yarn of the finest count and of the finest quality that we can.
('57', 285, 1, 8, 479659) As we cannot get here other yarn for comparison, some defects will of course remain; but we will keep up our efforts to reach as high a standard as possible.
('57', 285, 1, 9, 479817) I hope you are keeping good health.
('57', 285, 1, 10, 479853) I don’t write anything about Meghaji.

('57', 286, 7, 16, 481551) What you can experience in seclusion is certainly difficult, if not impossible, to experience in a group.
('57', 286, 7, 17, 481657) I have also noticed that some people cannot pray except in a group.
('57', 286, 7, 18, 481725) For such people individual prayer is essential.

('57', 287, 2, 3, 482360) October 27, 1932 I confess that I do not feel the same afflatus as you do, for I do not share the view that you hold about the Brahminical influence.
('57', 287, 2, 4, 482510) 1 Whilst the Brahmins have undoubtedly a great deal to answer for, I am sure that they have been much more sinned against than sinning.
('57', 287, 2, 5, 482646) Every religion has produced its own Brahmins.
('57', 287, 2, 6, 482692) That they have not been known as such makes no difference.

('57', 287, 2, 10, 483064) I believe with Vivekananda that Shankara never drove Budhism from India for he was himself a prachchhanna 2 Buddha.
('57', 287, 2, 11, 483180) He merely rid it of the bad things that were creeping into it, and prevented its alienation from Hinduism.
('57', 287, 2, 12, 483287) In my opinion nowhere has the influence of the teaching of Buddha been more abiding than in India.

('57', 288, 2, 3, 484372) October 27, 1932
('57', 288, 3, 4, 484389) VASUMATI,
('57', 288, 4, 5, 484399) I got your letter.
('57', 288, 4, 6, 484418) It is a mark of intellectual laziness to believe that whoever can give an account of every moment of his life can become a mahatma.
('57', 288, 4, 7, 484550) There are in the West many hard woking men and women who can give an account of every moment of their lives, but they are not fortunate enough to have become mahatmas.
('57', 288, 4, 8, 484718) Under the pretext that only a mahatma can do it, you cannot escape your duty to give an account of every moment.
('57', 288, 4, 9, 484831) Every one of us should from the habit of keeping such an account.
('57', 288, 4, 10, 484897) And no great credit should be given for it either.
('57', 288, 4, 11, 484948) The phrase, ‘one’s duty however defective ‘should not be interpreted to mean a duty which violates morality.
('57', 288, 4, 12, 485057) ‘Defective’ here means what seems to be inferior.
('57', 288, 4, 13, 485107) According to the Gita all duties have equal value, for Mother Gita attaches importance only to people’s hearts and, therefore, her standards are bound to be faultless.
('57', 288, 4, 14, 485275) For example, if a grain dealer who feels that his occupation is inferior to a clerk’s, gives up his trade and tries to become a clerk, wouldn’t he be a loser both ways?
('57', 288, 4, 15, 485444) In the same way, if Titus, who looks after the dairy, leaves the cows in order to serve Antyajas because Antyaja service has become fashionable just now, he will be said to have given up his duty and acted contrary to the teaching of the Gita.
('57', 288, 4, 16, 485688) Similarly, if you women who have bound yourselves by vows to do certain work, leave it and take up some other work of service, you will be guilty of forsaking your duty.
('57', 288, 4, 17, 485858) Is this quite clear?
('57', 288, 4, 18, 485879) I see nothing wrong in a person going out of the Ashram to improve his health and returning to it after it has improved.
('57', 288, 4, 19, 486000) Don’t I myself ask many to do so?
('57', 288, 4, 20, 486034) But anybody who vows not to return to the Ashram and keeps the vow, as Gangadevi did, deserves all honour.
('57', 288, 4, 21, 486141) Only a rare person can do that, and only if he has accepted the idea with his whole heart.
('57', 288, 4, 22, 486232) Such a person, even if he or she has to be looked after by others, does great service by setting an example of immense patience and non attachment to life.
('57', 288, 4, 23, 486388) Moreover, our aspiration is to live as simply as poor people do.
('57', 288, 4, 24, 486453) The latter, even when they suffer extreme pain through some disease, cannot leave either their home or their village.
('57', 288, 4, 25, 486571) They remain satisfied with whatever their friends and
('57', 289, 0, 1, 486625) 290 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 289, 1, 2, 486667) relations can do for them and some do not get even that much service.
('57', 289, 1, 3, 486737) We should bow in reverence to a person who, being a man of knowledge, voluntarily suffers with similar patience.
('57', 289, 1, 4, 486850) He serves the people even by setting an example of such patience.
('57', 289, 1, 5, 486916) That is why I had suggested to Punjabhai that it would be good both for him and for the Ashram if he died in it, nursed by the inmates.
('57', 289, 1, 6, 487052) And for the same reason, I told Kishorelal that he should not mind having to be looked after by other people in the Ashram, for a man like him served the Ashram by his mere presence.
('57', 289, 1, 7, 487235) I have only stated a principle 1 in my letter to Narandas.
('57', 289, 1, 8, 487294) You need not think much about it.
('57', 289, 1, 9, 487328) If anybody is inspired by that highest sense of dharma, let him take such a step.
('57', 289, 1, 10, 487410) You should do only what you can.

('57', 289, 6, 14, 487591) LILAVATI, I have your letter.
('57', 289, 6, 15, 487621) I wrote 2 what I wrote to satisfy you, but I see that you are not satisfied.
('57', 289, 6, 16, 487698) My intention in writing that you were free was that nobody could force you, but you could do as you wished.
('57', 289, 6, 17, 487806) No other meaning was implied.
('57', 289, 6, 18, 487836) I have actually said that I have trust in you and that ultimately you will attain stability.
('57', 289, 6, 19, 487929) There have been numerous complaints.
('57', 289, 6, 20, 487966) They are all about your impatience, your indecision and your anger.
('57', 289, 6, 21, 488034) But I have not heeded them.
('57', 289, 6, 22, 488062) I did not mean to suggest that you had no respect for Narandas.
('57', 289, 6, 23, 488126) But my words can be interpreted to suggest that in spite of your respect for Narandas you are unable to follow his instructions.
('57', 289, 6, 24, 488255) And if you are unable to doso, I see nothing wrong in your considering yourself free.
('57', 289, 6, 25, 488341) I wish you would give up your craving for a bicycle.
('57', 289, 6, 26, 488394) You should do whatever you can without it and be content.

('57', 290, 5, 8, 488889) October 27, 1932 The atman, as everyone will agree, is not destroyed with the body.
('57', 290, 5, 9, 488973) Similarly the atman exists prior to the birth of the body.
('57', 290, 5, 10, 489032) If we accept this, we have no reason to believe that the atman will not be reborn in a body or that it did not occupy a body in the past.
('57', 290, 5, 11, 489170) But to hold that the atman will necessarily inhabit a form because it is inhabiting one at present would be merely falling in with the popular belief.

('57', 290, 9, 17, 489478) You must finish whatever you take up.
('57', 290, 9, 18, 489516) I do not see any need for observing a weekly fast.

('57', 290, 9, 20, 489627) You may take my word in all this.
('57', 290, 9, 21, 489661) Your good lies in doing with all sincerity whatever work Narandas may assign to you.
('57', 290, 9, 22, 489746) Give up worrying about Kudsia.
('57', 290, 9, 23, 489777) Let Narandas do what is his duty.

('57', 292, 7, 12, 491961) PARASRAM, No parallel can be drawn at all between what was said during the conversation with Acharya Gidwani and the question of inter dining with Harijans.
('57', 292, 7, 13, 492118) Those who arrange such dinners have already goodwill in their hearts for the latter.
('57', 292, 7, 14, 492203) Hence the students who join such dinners for sharing in their pleasure cannot be compared with them.
('57', 292, 7, 15, 492304) And in any case the Harijans cannot be compared with such students who are attracted to the parties by the thought of enjoyment, for what we do for Harijans cannot be described as temptation held out to them.
('57', 292, 7, 16, 492513) Those who do prayaschitta do it not as a temptation to anybody but for self purification.
('57', 292, 7, 17, 492603) Is not all this as clear as daylight?
('57', 292, 7, 18, 492641) Whether or not mixed dinner parties are proper is a separate issue.
('57', 292, 7, 19, 492709) In certain circumstances such a party may be proper and in certain other circumstances it may not be so.
('57', 292, 7, 20, 492814) Thus it is entirely a question of the circumstances of each case.

('57', 293, 4, 5, 493534) I have your beautifully written letter but it gives no news about you or Amina.
('57', 293, 4, 6, 493614) You should give that information in the next letter.
('57', 293, 4, 7, 493667) There should be no trace of the piles trouble left.
('57', 293, 4, 8, 493719) It is very necessary, so long as the pain persists, to be very careful about food.
('57', 293, 4, 9, 493802) Those who get operated upon for piles some times make the serious mistake of thinking that after the operation they can eat anything they like.
('57', 293, 4, 10, 493946) It is not so at all.
('57', 293, 4, 11, 493967) Those afflicted with piles cannot eat even simple food.
('57', 293, 4, 12, 494023) After the piles have been removed they can eat such food.
('57', 293, 4, 13, 494081) But those who after the operation eat heavy food or food which they cannot digest or hot foods like chillies and other spices invariably have a relapse.
('57', 293, 4, 14, 494234) And for two or three months after the operation, the greatest care has to be exercised.
('57', 293, 4, 15, 494322) Amina also should pay careful attention to what I have written.
('57', 293, 4, 16, 494386) I wish of get much service from both of you.

('57', 295, 13, 25, 497894) If, however, deep in your heart you desire to marry, you should yield to your mother’s wish.
('57', 295, 13, 26, 497987) The way out of the problem created by the number of eligible young men in your community 1 being smaller than that of girls is to marry the girls outside the community.

('57', 296, 1, 3, 498305) It is true that it is an age old tradition among the Hindus but traditions change with time.
('57', 296, 1, 4, 498398) I have replied to your questions because your letter was so very sincere.

('57', 296, 3, 8, 498587) 519. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
('57', 296, 4, 9, 498618) Padavo [October 30] 1 1932
('57', 296, 5, 10, 498645) NARANDAS,
('57', 296, 6, 11, 498655) This time I got your packet on Tuesday.
('57', 296, 6, 12, 498695) By the time you get this letter, I am sure Mohan will be on his feet again.
('57', 296, 6, 13, 498771) I don’t suppose you read Balbhadra’s 2 long letter.
('57', 296, 6, 14, 498823) Pass on my letter to him without reading it, since that is his wish.
('57', 296, 6, 15, 498892) It is desirable that we should respect children’s wishes in such matters.
('57', 296, 6, 16, 498966) Send for him and tell him that, as suggested by me, the letter is given to him without being read.
('57', 296, 6, 17, 499065) That will make him happy.
('57', 296, 6, 18, 499091) He had mentioned two things in his letter.
('57', 296, 6, 19, 499134) One, that he was very much afraid of his father, and two, that every time he did something wrong you and Prema threatened to send him away to his father.
('57', 296, 6, 20, 499288) The complaint seemed exaggerated to me.
('57', 296, 6, 21, 499328) But he is an obstinate child and likely to get on one’s nerves.
('57', 296, 6, 22, 499392) I would not, therefore, be surprised if he had really been scolded in that manner.The child has no one to care for him.
('57', 296, 6, 23, 499512) And, morever, he is dull witted, so that everybody makes fun of him.
('57', 296, 6, 24, 499581) Not being able to realize his foolishness, he is uspet when people make fun of him.
('57', 296, 6, 25, 499665) Such children deserve great pity.
('57', 296, 6, 26, 499699) Talk to him casually and find out all this from him and give what sympathy you can.
('57', 296, 6, 27, 499783) If his fear of us, whether or not he has reason for such fear, leaves him, the fear of his father also will not remain much longer.
('57', 296, 6, 28, 499915) At present he is very much afraid that, if he is sent away from the Ashram, he will have to go to his father.
('57', 296, 6, 29, 500025) One more complaint which he makes is that students do not now enjoy the freedom which they formerly had.
('57', 296, 6, 30, 500130) I don’t think there is any truth in this complaint, and I have told him so in my letter.
('57', 296, 6, 31, 500219) However, you may think about the matter if there is any element of

('57', 297, 1, 2, 500440) truth in it.
('57', 297, 1, 3, 500453) I have a very angry letter from Ratilal.
('57', 297, 1, 4, 500494) He says in it that you got very angry with him, insulted him, and so forth.
('57', 297, 1, 5, 500570) Champa also has joined in the complaint.
('57', 297, 1, 6, 500611) I do not understand why she is angry with you.
('57', 297, 1, 7, 500658) I understand what you say in regard to money.
('57', 297, 1, 8, 500704) I have a letter from Mahavir in which he says he will return to the Ashram in a few days, and also that he has asked for your permission to come and see me on his way to Ahmedabad.
('57', 297, 1, 9, 500885) On my part, I have asked him to give up the idea.
('57', 297, 1, 10, 500935) For one thing, it is still uncertain whether I shall start seeing visitors again.
('57', 297, 1, 11, 501017) And a visit here would mean an unnecessary expense of about thirty rupees.
('57', 297, 1, 12, 501092) How can it be justified?
('57', 297, 1, 13, 501117) I think it would be desirable if Navin goes to Almora as soon as he can.
('57', 297, 1, 14, 501190) In my letter 1 to Mathuradas, I have written at length about spinning fine yarn.
('57', 297, 1, 15, 501271) Read that letter.
('57', 297, 1, 16, 501289) Did you find Tilakam’s health very much improved when he returned there?
('57', 297, 1, 17, 501362) What is his diet at present?
('57', 297, 1, 18, 501391) I think Mirabehn’s diet will suit him.
('57', 297, 1, 19, 501430) His body is built on non vegetarian diet.
('57', 297, 1, 20, 501472) I have often observed that persons who have been used to non vegetarian diet cannot preserve strength on pulses.
('57', 297, 1, 21, 501585) But they can live on milk, rotli, green vegetables and sour lemons.
('57', 297, 1, 22, 501653) The reason is this.
('57', 297, 1, 23, 501673) Non vegetarians do not require much starch.
('57', 297, 1, 24, 501717) When they give up flesh, they eat plenty of starch to satisfy their hunger and a good quantity of pulses to provide nourishment to the tissues.
('57', 297, 1, 25, 501861) Naturally they cannot digest all this food and in consequence fall ill.
('57', 297, 1, 26, 501933) If, when giving up non vegetarian food, such persons take milk in sufficient quantity, it would supply them the nourishment which they previously got from flesh.
('57', 297, 1, 27, 502095) And their hunger would be satisfied by whole flour bread.
('57', 297, 1, 28, 502153) The bran contained in surch bread and the natural water of the green vegetables would help them to keep their bowels clean.
('57', 297, 1, 29, 502277) This is the theory.
('57', 297, 1, 30, 502297) Vegetarian diet agreed with Mirabehn immediately because I did not permit her to eat pulses at all.
('57', 297, 1, 31, 502397) Of course her firm determination also was an important factor.
('57', 297, 1, 32, 502460) She had resolved, from the very day she came into contact with me through letters, that she would not eat non vegetarian food even if she died without it.
('57', 297, 1, 33, 502615) But her resolution and faith are unusual.
('57', 297, 1, 34, 502657) I have written to Jamna a long sermon on the primus stove.
('57', 297, 1, 35, 502716) Ask the other women also to read it, and then they may do as they like.
('57', 297, 1, 36, 502788) Their renouncing the use of the primus stove will benefit them only if

('57', 298, 1, 2, 502964) they do so willingly.
('57', 298, 1, 3, 502986) Read my letter to Jethalal.
('57', 298, 1, 4, 503014) I need not write more about the subject here.
('57', 298, 1, 5, 503060) That letter contains the answers to your questions.
('57', 298, 1, 6, 503112) I hope Purushottam’s health has not deteriorated after his arrival there.
('57', 298, 1, 7, 503186) You will notice that I have dictated quite a large number of the letters this time.
('57', 298, 1, 8, 503270) The right elbow is in the same condition now as the left was.
('57', 298, 1, 9, 503332) I may say that I took too much freedom in writing letters after the last fast.
('57', 298, 1, 10, 503411) Besides the letters to people in the Ashram, I wrote a great number of other letters too.
('57', 298, 1, 11, 503501) Moreover, I wrote every day.
('57', 298, 1, 12, 503530) Add to that spinning for two and a half hours.
('57', 298, 1, 13, 503577) The exertion proved too much.
('57', 298, 1, 14, 503607) I, therefore, decided to spare the right hand from writing work as much as possible.
('57', 298, 1, 15, 503692) As a result, the condition of the elbow is a little better now.
('57', 298, 1, 16, 503756) But you need not worry at all.
('57', 298, 1, 17, 503787) At this age, I cannot expect to regain lost fat and tissue very soon.
('57', 298, 1, 18, 503857) In six days the body had thinned visibly.
('57', 298, 1, 19, 503899) It cannot become as it was before the fast in a month.
('57', 298, 1, 20, 503954) There is no reason in this to feel concerned.
('57', 298, 1, 21, 504000) I can do all ordinary work as usual.
('57', 298, 1, 22, 504037) If I have been writing for the whole life, there is nothing wrong in my giving a long rest to the hand, and no cause whatever to feel surprised or concerned.
('57', 298, 1, 23, 504195) There is certainly no disease in the hand.
('57', 298, 1, 24, 504238) It does not pain when I do not work with it.
('57', 298, 1, 25, 504283) I do not feel the pain even when I am working but afterwards as it starts paining I feel that that part is exhausted.
('57', 298, 1, 26, 504401) Hence, as a measure of precaution, I am giving rest to it.
('57', 298, 1, 27, 504460) All the inmates have my blessings for the New Year as a matter of course.
('57', 298, 1, 28, 504534) Even children who can understand things know very well now what I expect from the Ashram.
('57', 298, 1, 29, 504624) It is my hope that all the inmates, grown ups and children, may acquire the strength of character and devotion to service which would fulfil my expectations and my prayer to God that He may grant such strength to you all.

('57', 300, 1, 2, 506426) 523. LETTER TO MOHANLAL M. BHATT
('57', 300, 2, 3, 506459) October 30, 1932
('57', 300, 3, 4, 506476) I don’t think that I can lay down rules for indefinite fasting which would satisfy you.
('57', 300, 3, 5, 506564) I might say only this.
('57', 300, 3, 6, 506587) A fast should be characterized by perfect truth and non violence, and should be undertaken only upon the prompting of one’s inner voice and not in blind imitation of somebody.
('57', 300, 3, 7, 506763) One should never undertake a fast for a selfish end; the aim behind a fast should always be common good.
('57', 300, 3, 8, 506868) A fast should never be undertaken for any object which is inspired by ill will towards somebody.
('57', 300, 3, 9, 506965) But what is inner voice?
('57', 300, 3, 10, 506990) Can everybody claim it?
('57', 300, 3, 11, 507014) These are important questions.
('57', 300, 3, 12, 507045) Of course the inner voice speaks to everybody; but he whose ear has not learnt to recognize and listen to the inner voice will not be able to hear it, just as a deaf person cannot hear even the sweetest music.
('57', 300, 3, 13, 507255) The ears of one who lacks self control cannot recognize the true inner voice.
('57', 300, 3, 14, 507333) Only that person will be fit to recognize it who possesses the charactertistics of the sthitaprajna given in Ch. II of the Gita, or of the devotee in Ch. XII, or of the gunatita in Ch. XIV or the one in whom all the three gunas blend.
('57', 300, 3, 15, 507568) The question put by Sundaram is improper.
('57', 300, 3, 16, 507610) 1 But now that he has asked it, I ought to say that, according to me, on the whole the Hindu religion is “nearest to the truth”.
('57', 300, 3, 17, 507739) But at the same time I admit unhesitatingly that in holding this view I may be making a mistake through ignorance or partiality.
('57', 300, 3, 18, 507868) The mistake, if any, is paradonable and one which has its use, because, in the absence of all ignorance and partiality it would be impossible for any man to cling to his religion, and he would, and ought to, embrace another religion in which he saw more of truth.
('57', 300, 3, 19, 508132) Call it God’s maya or know it by any other name you choose, but all human beings have this weakness.
('57', 300, 3, 20, 508233) And yet, in spite of such attachment to one’s own religion, one ought to hold all religions in equal regard.
('57', 300, 3, 21, 508342) In other words, I should, as a Hindu, accept it as natural for a Christian to believe that Christianity is nearer to the truth and for a Muslim to believe that about Islam, and also that it is necessary for them to do so if they are to follow their respective religions sincerely.
('57', 300, 3, 22, 508623) I ought to bear them no ill will for such a belief, nor should I regard their belief as mistaken.
('57', 300, 3, 23, 508721) I hope that what I have said will be clear to Bhai Sundaram and to all of you.
('57', 300, 3, 24, 508800) Probably this view of mine about equality towards all religions is a new idea.
('57', 300, 4, 25, 508879) 1 He had asked which religion, in Gandhiji’s view, was nearest to the truth.

('57', 301, 1, 4, 509172) My view enables me to cling to Hinduism and to hold other religions in reverence at the same time, and adopt from them without hesitation whatever is good in them.

('57', 302, 5, 9, 511106) October 30, 1932
('57', 302, 6, 10, 511123) Vidya means knowledge and avidya means activity.
('57', 302, 6, 11, 511172) The mean ings of sambhooti and asambhooti are related to the meanings vidya and avidya.
('57', 302, 6, 12, 511260) Hence asambhooti means the body and sambhooti means the self.
('57', 302, 6, 13, 511322) I interpret the expressions thus for my own satisfaction.
('57', 302, 6, 14, 511380) I feel that this interpretation explains the meaning of the Ishopanishad easily and satisfactorily.

('57', 303, 13, 18, 512837) October 30, 1932 There is no uniformity of policy in public institutions because the workers lack charity and the men at the head do not have perfect humility.
('57', 303, 13, 19, 512997) Generally no difficulty is experienced in an institution in which the head is a man of self control.
('57', 303, 13, 20, 513098) From these facts, we can deduce one rule at any rate, namely, that the greater the self control on the part of the workers the greater the chances of unity in that institution will be.

('57', 304, 12, 15, 513818) Doyle of the 24th inst.
('57', 304, 12, 16, 513842) and unless it comes in the course of the day, the progressive non co operation adumbrated in that letter will commence from tomorrow.
('57', 304, 12, 17, 513976) As stated in that letter, I shall begin by denying myself the special food issued to me.
('57', 304, 12, 18, 514065) Will you kindly therefore have the goat’s milk stopped as from tomorrow?
('57', 304, 12, 19, 514138) Besides this, just now I am only drawing sour limes and vegetables in common with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and sometimes taking a little brown bread from Sjt.
('57', 304, 12, 20, 514297) Mahadev Desai’s ration.
('57', 304, 12, 21, 514321) Sardar Vallabhbhai sends for the limes and vegetables and I have asked him not to send for my portion.
('57', 304, 12, 22, 514424) In lieu of this, I shall take, for the time being and if they are issued to me, the morning kanji and the noon and the afternoon bhakri out of the ‘C’ class rations.
('57', 304, 12, 23, 514590) I may not take anything else from the ‘C’ class rations, and I can only take during any twenty four hours five ingredients besides salt, soda and water.
('57', 304, 12, 24, 514743) The vegetables and dholl generally issued to ‘C ‘class prisoners contain more than three or four ingredients.
('57', 304, 12, 25, 514853) These therefore I may not take.
('57', 304, 12, 26, 514885) I do not propose to take anything specially prepared for special ‘C’ class prisoners 2.

('57', 304, 13, 28, 515035) 2 On receiveing this letter, Mahadev Desai says, Major Bhandari saw Gandhiji and tried to dissuade him saying that by refusing food he was used to he would become weak and might even get dysentery.

('57', 305, 1, 2, 515322) As a large amount of correspondence on untouchability, some of which is very important, has accumulated, and requires answering with a view to publication, I think that it is incumbent upon Govern ment either to publish my correspondence with Government on the matter or to inform the public, in any other manner Government may choose, of my request and their refusal to accede to it.
('57', 305, 1, 3, 515707) It is needless to add that I have scrupulously avoided, either directly or indirectly, the leakage of any information about the correspondence.

('57', 305, 6, 13, 516308) I cannot live and not work for the removal of untouchability.

('57', 307, 7, 19, 519108) October 31, 1932 Patients observe silence on account of their suffering, some orators observe it to give rest to their throats and some observe it when in a mood for introspection.
('57', 307, 7, 20, 519289) All three can benefit each in his own way.
('57', 307, 7, 21, 519332) The introspective persons will, ordinarily, spend the day in seclusion, fast or have a light meal.
('57', 307, 7, 22, 519431) If necessary they will study writings inducing calm thoughts.
('57', 307, 7, 23, 519493) Observing silence for its own sake does little good and may cause harm.

('57', 317, 1, 10, 532922) Why does she not write to me at all?
('57', 317, 1, 11, 532959) There is not much difference between pure love and universal love.

('57', 317, 10, 27, 533795) You have been detained in order to nurse the patients.
('57', 317, 10, 28, 533850) If we look at it objectively this is wrong.
('57', 317, 10, 29, 533894) But we cannot always do so.
('57', 317, 10, 30, 533922) So it is all right that you are detained.
('57', 317, 10, 31, 533964) Try to free yourself at the first opportunity.
('57', 317, 10, 32, 534011) But give service without hesitation so long as it is necessary.

('57', 318, 5, 11, 534473) Do I not know the situation in Sind?
('57', 318, 5, 12, 534510) I know Sindhi women well.
('57', 318, 5, 13, 534536) Through love even this situation can be improved.
('57', 318, 5, 14, 534586) In work, the most important thing is to do ourselves what we want others to do.
('57', 318, 5, 15, 534666) This you are doing.
('57', 318, 5, 16, 534686) But remember that Mother Gita teaches us to keep on doing work without worrying about the fruit thereof.
('57', 318, 5, 17, 534791) It is for God to worry about the fruit.
('57', 318, 5, 18, 534831) Anand remains sad.

('57', 318, 5, 21, 534999) But this will happen once Anand get out.

('57', 319, 11, 21, 536244) MIRA, I got your letter yesterday afternoon.
('57', 319, 11, 22, 536289) It is now 5.15 a.m.
('57', 319, 11, 23, 536309) We have had the prayer, then the honey, hot water and a pinch of soda.
('57', 319, 11, 24, 536380) Then we three together prepared my fruit, viz., two musambis which Mahadev peeled, two santras which I peeled and juice of a pomegranate which Sardar extracted.
('57', 319, 11, 25, 536541) I added a pinch of salt to the juice and put the musambi and the santra pulp into the juice.
('57', 319, 11, 26, 536634) They two went out for a stroll and I ate the salad.
('57', 319, 11, 27, 536686) It was then 5.15. And I began this letter.
('57', 319, 11, 28, 536729) The left hand writing is by way of change and rest for the right hand.
('57', 319, 11, 29, 536800) Writing of the fruit salad, I give you my discovery.
('57', 319, 11, 30, 536853) I find that fruit to produce the greatest effect should be taken by itself and on an empty stomach.
('57', 319, 11, 31, 536953) You might almost say, the same law applies to juicy fruit that applies to opening medicines.
('57', 319, 11, 32, 537046) In fact all food should be taken as medicine.
('57', 319, 11, 33, 537092) The Sanskrit for food and medicine is a common word aushadh.
('57', 319, 11, 34, 537153) Kisen will explain this more fully to you.
('57', 319, 11, 35, 537196) Medicine need not be nasty to taste; nor is it taken for the pleasure of the palate.

('57', 320, 1, 2, 537331) Food should be treated exactly in the same manner, i.e., suitable food in suitable proportion in suitable manner and at suitable times.
('57', 320, 1, 3, 537467) Here I interrupted the writing for the morning walk and now resume at 6.45. There are many books on the life of the Prophet.
('57', 320, 1, 4, 537592) The first place must be given to Amir Ali’s Spirit of Islam.
('57', 320, 1, 5, 537653) Then there is WashingtonIrving’s Mahomet and His Successors, a very well written work.
('57', 320, 1, 6, 537740) Carlyle’s Mahomet as Hero is also well worth reading.
('57', 320, 1, 7, 537794) I am glad you have Kisen with you.
('57', 320, 1, 8, 537829) She should get the most out of you and you of her.
('57', 320, 1, 9, 537880) I wonder if she got my letter in reply to hers.
('57', 320, 1, 10, 537928) I sent it to the address she gave.
('57', 320, 1, 11, 537963) Whether she received it or not, tell her never to write a bad hand whether there is hurry or not.
('57', 320, 1, 12, 538061) This lesson everyone should learn from my misfortune.
('57', 320, 1, 13, 538115) Bad writing and bad everything is truly himsa.
('57', 320, 1, 14, 538162) We have a rare opportunity of learning the virtue of patience in prison life.
('57', 320, 1, 15, 538240) I think your comparison between Jesus and Muhammed is striking and partly true.
('57', 320, 1, 16, 538320) You have heard the saying comparisons are odious.
('57', 320, 1, 17, 538370) In my opinion all revolutionaries are reformers and all reformers are revolutionaries.
('57', 320, 1, 18, 538457) Both were great teachers and each was in response to his age and its requirements.
('57', 320, 1, 19, 538540) And each made a unique contribution to the advance of mankind.
('57', 320, 1, 20, 538603) They have an equal place in the universal pantheon.
('57', 320, 1, 21, 538655) Your description of yourself as an ashramite is perfect.
('57', 320, 1, 22, 538712) You do not deny Christ but you affirm yourself as an ashramite who denies no teacher.
('57', 320, 1, 23, 538798) We are not concerned much with the interpretations of the different teachers.
('57', 320, 1, 24, 538876) Each fashioned his or her own.
('57', 320, 1, 25, 538907) I am sending by registered post Amir Ali’s book.
('57', 320, 1, 26, 538956) When you have finished it, post it to Raihana.
('57', 320, 1, 27, 539003) It belongs to the Tyabjee’s.

('57', 321, 20, 25, 540077) As soon as I was in a position, the first thing I did was to send you a telegram which I hope you received in due time.
('57', 321, 20, 26, 540197) I am glad you have written at length.
('57', 321, 20, 27, 540235) It has enabled me to get an idea of the difficulties that face us.
('57', 321, 20, 28, 540302) But this movement is taken up in God’s name.
('57', 321, 20, 29, 540347) He is our guide and I am positive that if we do not lose faith in Him, He will remove all difficulties in our path and if we would conduct ourselve in the spirit of service we would not be uncharitable towards those who may

('57', 322, 1, 3, 541090) After all we do not know his difficulties.
('57', 322, 1, 4, 541133) We must therefore step into his shoes and look at the position even from his point of view.
('57', 322, 4, 5, 541225) found that this is the quickest method of reaching a goal.
('57', 322, 4, 6, 541284) We may not take our gaze off the goal for one single minute but in pursuing it we may not judge those who do not see eye to eye with us.
('57', 322, 4, 7, 541421) After all, as you very properly say, we have but ourselves to die in the attempt to deliver our suppressed brethern from the yoke.
('57', 322, 4, 8, 541552) Whatever happens, therefore, the people who are for the reform must remain strictly non violent in every sense of the term.

('57', 322, 6, 23, 542838) As they do not wish to interpose obstacles to Mr.Gandhi’s efforts in connection with the problem of untouchability, they are removing all restrictions on visitors correspon dence and publicity in regard to matters which in Mr. Gandhi’s own words have no reference to civil disobedience and are strictly limited to the removal of untouchability.

('57', 323, 2, 3, 543579) November 3, 1932 I am becoming more convinced from experience that, as one’s faith in God grows, one finds greater joy in doing one’s duty, becomes more efficient and vigilant, and also more calm and patient.
('57', 323, 2, 4, 543788) Since I have unlimited faith in God, I believe that it is He who enables us to do any work, small or big.
('57', 323, 2, 5, 543894) I do not know how He does that.
('57', 323, 2, 6, 543926) If a person who claims to have dedicated his all, body, mind and possessions, to God, believes that he himself has done something, he would be a thief.
('57', 323, 2, 7, 544078) I would not sin by ignorantly believing that I have done anything.
('57', 323, 2, 8, 544145) If I sometimes believe that or say that in ordinary conversation in joking or in order not to seem different from other people, it is foolishness on my part.
('57', 323, 2, 9, 544303) The truth is that I am daily growing more humble and, therfore feel pained whenever I think in pride that I have done something .

('57', 324, 4, 5, 544949) I have your letter.
('57', 324, 4, 6, 544969) I can understand your shock at the plight of the Harijans.
('57', 324, 4, 7, 545028) But there is not need to be agitated.
('57', 324, 4, 8, 545066) You should get what workers you can and try to improve the condition of the Harijan localities.
('57', 324, 4, 9, 545162) Meet the Harijan men.
('57', 324, 4, 10, 545184) Ultimately, ours is only to make the effort to the utmost, the result rests with God.
('57', 324, 4, 11, 545270) Give up worrying.
('57', 324, 4, 12, 545288) The Gita forbids us to worry.
('57', 324, 4, 13, 545318) I am awaiting Arun’s reply.

('57', 325, 5, 8, 546422) 571. STATEMENT ON UNTOUCHABILITY 1 I
('57', 325, 6, 9, 546459) November 4, 1932 For reasons over which I had no control I have not been able to deal with the question of untouchability, as I had fully intended to after the breaking of the fast.
('57', 325, 6, 10, 546641) The Government having now granted me permission to carry on public propaganda in connection with the work, I am able to deal with the numerous correspondents who have been writing to me either in criticism of the Yeravda Pact, or to seek guidance, or to know my views about the different questions that arise in the course of the campaign against untouchability.
('57', 325, 6, 11, 547004) In this prelim inary statement I propose to confine myself to the salient questions only, deferring for the time being other questions which do not call for immediate disposal.
('57', 325, 6, 12, 547181) I take up first the question of the possibility of my resuming the fast.
('57', 325, 6, 13, 547254) Some correspondents contend that the fast savours of coercion and should not have been undertaken at all and that, therefore, it should never be resumed.
('57', 325, 6, 14, 547408) Some others have argued that there is no warrant in Hindu religion, or any religion for that matter, for a fast like mine.
('57', 325, 6, 15, 547531) I do not propose to deal with the religious aspect.
('57', 325, 6, 16, 547583) Suffice it to say that it was at God’s call that I embarked upon the last fast and it would be at His call that it would be resumed, if it ever is.
('57', 325, 6, 17, 547731) But when it was first undertaken, it was undoubtedly for removal of untouch ability, root and branch.
('57', 325, 6, 18, 547833) That it took the form it did was no choice of mine.
('57', 325, 6, 19, 547885) The Cabinet decision precipitated the crisis of my life, but I
('57', 325, 7, 20, 547948) 1 Following the lifting of restrictions by the Government on Gandhiji’s inter views and his carrying on propaganda in connection with anti untouchability work, Gandhiji issued a series of statements to the Press.
('57', 325, 7, 21, 548161) This is the first of them.
('57', 326, 0, 1, 548188) VOL. 57 : 5 SEPTEMBER, 1932 15 NOVEMBER, 1932 327
('57', 326, 1, 2, 548238) knew that the revocation of the British Cabinet’s decision was to be but the begining of the end.
('57', 326, 1, 3, 548336) A tremendous force could not be set in motion merely in order to alter a political decision, unless it had behind it a much deeper meaning even unknown to its authors.
('57', 326, 1, 4, 548504) The people affected instinctively recognized that meaning and responded.
('57', 326, 1, 5, 548577) Perhaps no man within living memory has travelled so often from one end of India to the other or has penetrated so many villages and come into contact with so many millions as I have.
('57', 326, 1, 6, 548761) They have all known my life.
('57', 326, 1, 7, 548790) They have known that I have recognized no barriers between ‘untouchables’ and ‘touchables’ or caste and outcaste.
('57', 326, 1, 8, 548904) They have heard me speak often in their own tongues denouncing untouchability in unmeasured terms, describing it as a curse and a blot upon Hinduism.
('57', 326, 1, 9, 549054) With rare exceptions, at hundreds of these mass meetings or at private meetings in all parts of India, there has been no protest against my presentation of the case against untouchability.
('57', 326, 1, 10, 549243) Crowds have passed resolutions denouncing untouchability and pledging themselves to remove it from their midst and they have on innumerable occasions called God as witness to their pledge and asked for His blessing that He may give them strength to carry out their pledge.
('57', 326, 1, 11, 549516) It was against these millions that my fast was undertaken and it was their spontaneous love that brought about a transformation inside of five days and brought into being the Yeravda Pact.
('57', 326, 1, 12, 549705) And it will be against them that the fast will be resumed if that Pact is not carried out by them in its fullness.
('57', 326, 1, 13, 549820) The Government are now practically out of it.
('57', 326, 1, 14, 549866) Their part of the obligation they fulfilled promptly.
('57', 326, 1, 15, 549920) The major part of the resolutions of the Yeravda Pact has to be fulfilled by these millions, the so called caste Hindus, who have flocked to the meetings I have described.
('57', 326, 1, 16, 550092) It is they who have to embrace the suppressed brethren and sisters as their very own, whom they have to invite to their temples, to their homes, to their schools.
('57', 326, 1, 17, 550255) The ‘untouchables’ in the villages should be made to feel that their shackles have been broken, that they are in no way inferior to their fellow villagers, that they are worshippers of the same God as other villagers, and are entitled to the same rights and privileges that the latter enjoy.
('57', 326, 1, 18, 550547) But if these vital conditions of the Pact are not carried out by caste Hindus, could I possibly live to face God and man?
('57', 326, 1, 19, 550669) I ventured even to tell Dr. Ambedkar, Rao Bahadur Raja and other friends belonging to the suppressed group that they should regard me as a hostage for the due fulfilment by caste Hindus of the conditions of the Pact.
('57', 326, 1, 20, 550886) The fast, if it has to come, will not be for the coercion of
('57', 327, 0, 1, 550947) 328 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 327, 1, 2, 550989) those who are opponents of the reform, but it will be intended to sting into action those who have been my comrades or who have taken pledges for the removal of untouchability.
('57', 327, 1, 3, 551166) If they belie their pledge, or if they never meant to abide by them, and their Hinduism was a mere camouflage, I should have no interest left in life.
('57', 327, 1, 4, 551317) My fast, therefore, ought not to affect the opponents of reform, nor even fellow workers and the millions who have led me to believe that they were with me and the Congress in the campaign against untouchability, if the latter have on second thoughts come to the conclusion that untouchability is not after all a crime against God and humanity.
('57', 327, 1, 5, 551662) In my opinion, fasting for purification of self and others is an age long institution and it will subsist so long as man believes in God.
('57', 327, 1, 6, 551800) It is the prayer to the Almighty from an anguished heart.
('57', 327, 1, 7, 551858) But whether my argument is wise or foolish, I cannot be dislodged from my position so long as I do not see the folly or the error of it.
('57', 327, 1, 8, 551995) It will be resumed only in obedience to the inner voice, and only if there is manifest breakdown of the Yeravda Pact, owing to the criminal neglect of caste Hindus to implement its conditions.
('57', 327, 1, 9, 552188) Such neglect would mean a betrayal of Hinduism.
('57', 327, 1, 10, 552236) I should not care to remain its living witness.
('57', 327, 1, 11, 552284) There is another fast which is a near possibility and that is in connection with the opening of the Guruvayur temple in Kerala.
('57', 327, 1, 12, 552412) It was at my urgent request that Sjt.
('57', 327, 1, 13, 552450) Kelappan suspended his fast for three months, a fast that had well nigh brought him to death’s door.
('57', 327, 1, 14, 552551) I would be in honour bound to fast with him if on or before the first January next that temple is not opened to the ‘untouchables’ precisely on the same terms as the ‘touchables’, and if it becomes necessary for Sjt.
('57', 327, 1, 15, 552768) Kelappan to resume his fast.
('57', 327, 1, 16, 552797) I have been obliged to dwell at some length upon these possible fasts because of the receipt of hot correspondence from two or three quarters.
('57', 327, 1, 17, 552940) Co workers, however, should not be agitated over the possiblity.
('57', 327, 1, 18, 553005) To become unnerved over a prospect one would not like face very often results in its materializing.
('57', 327, 1, 19, 553105) The best way of averting it is for all affected by it to put forth their whole strength into the work that would render the occurence impossible.
('57', 327, 1, 20, 553251) Correspondents have asked whether inter dining and inter marriage are part of the movement against untouchability.
('57', 327, 1, 21, 553366) In my opinion they are not.
('57', 327, 1, 22, 553394) They touch the caste men equally with the outcastes.
('57', 327, 1, 23, 553447) It is, therefore, not obligatory on an anti untouchability
('57', 328, 0, 1, 553506) VOL. 57 : 5 SEPTEMBER, 1932 15 NOVEMBER, 1932 329
('57', 328, 1, 2, 553556) worker to devote himself or herself to inter dining and intermarriage reform.
('57', 328, 1, 3, 553634) Personally, I am of opinion that this reform is coming sooner than we expect.
('57', 328, 1, 4, 553712) Restriction on inter caste dining and inter caste marriage is no part of Hindu religion.
('57', 328, 1, 5, 553801) It is a social custom which crept into Hinduism when perhaps it was in its decline, and was then meant perhaps to be temporary protection against disintegration of Hindu society, and emphasis on them has turned the attention of mass mind from the fundamentals which are vital to life’s growth.
('57', 328, 1, 6, 554095) Wherever, therefore, people voluntarily take part in functions where ‘touchables’ and ‘untouchables’, Hindus and in non Hindus are invited to join dinner parties, I welcome them as a healthy sign.
('57', 328, 1, 7, 554292) But I should never dream of making this reform, however desirable in itself it may be, part of an all India reform which has been long overdue.
('57', 328, 1, 8, 554436) Untouchability in the form we all know it is a canker eating into the very vitals of Hinduism.
('57', 328, 1, 9, 554531) Dining and marriage restrictions stunt Hindu society.
('57', 328, 1, 10, 554585) I think the distinction is fundamental.
('57', 328, 1, 11, 554625) It would be unwise in a hurricane capmaign to overweight and thus endanger the main issue.
('57', 328, 1, 12, 554716) It may even amount to a breach of faith with the masses to call upon them suddenly to view the removal of untouchability in a light different from what they have been taught to believe it to be.
('57', 328, 1, 13, 554911) On the one hand, therefore, whilst inter dining may go on where the public is itself ready for it, it should not be part of the India wide campaign.
('57', 328, 1, 14, 555060) I have letters, some of them angrily worded, from those who style themselves sanatanists.
('57', 328, 1, 15, 555150) For them untouchability, is the essence of Hinduism.
('57', 328, 1, 16, 555203) Some of them regard me as a renegade.
('57', 328, 1, 17, 555241) Some others consider that I have imbibed notions against untouchability and the like from Christianity and Islam.
('57', 328, 1, 18, 555355) Some again quote scriptures in defence of untouchability.
('57', 328, 1, 19, 555413) To these I have promised a reply through this statement.
('57', 328, 1, 20, 555470) I would venture, therefore, to tell these correspondents that I claim myself to be a sanatanist.
('57', 328, 1, 21, 555567) Their definition of a sanatanist is obviously different from mine.
('57', 328, 1, 22, 555634) For me sanatan dharma is the vital faith handed down from generations belonging even to prehistoric period and based upon the Vedas and the writings that followed them.
('57', 328, 1, 23, 555803) For me the Vedas are as indefinable as God and Hinduism.
('57', 328, 1, 24, 555860) It would be only partially true to say that the Vedas are the four books which one finds in print.
('57', 328, 1, 25, 555959) These books are themselves remnants of the discourses left by the unknown seers.
('57', 328, 1, 26, 556040) Those of later generations added to these original treasures according to their lights.
('57', 328, 1, 27, 556128) There then arose a great and lofty minded man, the composer of the Gita.
('57', 329, 0, 1, 556201) 330 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 329, 1, 2, 556243) gave to the Hindu world a synthesis of Hindu religion at once deeply philosophical and yet easily to be understood by any unsophisticated seeker.
('57', 329, 1, 3, 556389) It is the one open book to every Hindu who will care to study it, and if all the other scriptures were reduced to ashes, the seven hundred verses of this imperishable booklet are quite enough to tell one what Hinduism is and how one can live up to it.
('57', 329, 1, 4, 556641) And I claim to be a sanatanist because for forty years I have been seeking literally to live up to the teachings of that book.
('57', 329, 1, 5, 556768) Whatever is contrary to its main theme I reject as un Hindu.
('57', 329, 1, 6, 556829) It excludes no faith and no teacher.
('57', 329, 1, 7, 556866) It gives me great joy to be able to say that I have studied the Bible, the Koran, Zend Avesta and the other scriptures of the world with thesame reverence that I have given to the Gita.
('57', 329, 1, 8, 557052) This reverent reading has strengthened my faith in the Gita.
('57', 329, 1, 9, 557113) They have broadened my outlook and therefore my Hinduism.
('57', 329, 1, 10, 557171) Lives of Zoroaster, Jesus and Mohammed, as I have understood them, have illumined many a passage in the Gita.
('57', 329, 1, 11, 557281) What, therefore, these sanatani friends have hurled against me as a taunt has been to me a source of consolation.
('57', 329, 1, 12, 557395) I take pride in calling myself a Hindu becuase I find the term broad enough not merely to tolerate but to assimilate the teachings of prophets from all the four corners of the earth.
('57', 329, 1, 13, 557578) I find no warrant for untouchability in this book of life.
('57', 329, 1, 14, 557637) On the contrary it compels me, by an appeal to my reason and a more penetrating appeal to my heart, in language that has a magnetic touch about it, to believe that all life is one and that it is through God and must return to Him.
('57', 329, 1, 15, 557868) According to sanatan dharma taught by that venerable Mother 1, life does not consist in outward rites and ceremonial, but it consists in the uttermost inner purification and merging oneself, body, soul and mind, in the divine essence.
('57', 329, 1, 16, 558103) I have gone to the masses in their millions with this message of the Gita burnt into my life.
('57', 329, 1, 17, 558197) And they have listened to me, I am quite sure, not for any political wisdom or for eloquence, but because they have instinctively recognized me as one of them, as one belonging to their faith.
('57', 329, 1, 18, 558390) And as days have gone by, my belief has grown stronger and stronger that I could not be wrong in claiming to belong to sanatan dharma, and if God wills it, He will let me seal that claim with my death.

('57', 330, 2, 3, 558706) November 4, 1932
('57', 330, 3, 4, 558723) MY DEAR CHARLIE, I have two letters to answer.
('57', 330, 3, 5, 558770) Of course your decision is right.
('57', 330, 3, 6, 558804) Your problem of untouchability is in a way more complex than mine.
('57', 330, 3, 7, 558871) Untouchability is a dying cult and has an ever growing army of reformers to deal it death blows.
('57', 330, 3, 8, 558968) Yours shows no signs of dying and claims many supporters in the name of science.
('57', 330, 3, 9, 559049) And you have very few workers.
('57', 330, 3, 10, 559080) But as you and I have repeatedly found, what is difficult for man is easy for God.
('57', 330, 3, 11, 559163) Anyway, we have but to do our part of work, and I shall pray for success in your work.
('57', 330, 3, 12, 559250) I assure you I do not want to kill brother ass.
('57', 330, 3, 13, 559298) He is in God’s safe keeping.
('57', 330, 3, 14, 559327) If He means to starve him, neither your effort nor mine can save him.
('57', 330, 3, 15, 559397) For the present he is flourishing on goat’s milk and plenty of fruit with some home made bread thrown in.
('57', 330, 3, 16, 559503) Gurudev is still at it.
('57', 330, 3, 17, 559527) That little fast brought me many undreamt of treasures.
('57', 330, 3, 18, 559583) Gurudev was the richest find.
('57', 330, 3, 19, 559613) If someone had said “fast to find Gurudev” I should have done it without a second thought.
('57', 330, 3, 20, 559704) I was dying to find a corner in his heart.
('57', 330, 3, 21, 559747) Thank God I found it through the fast.
('57', 330, 3, 22, 559786) Love from us all.

('57', 330, 6, 24, 559831) 573. STATEMENT ON UNTOUCHABILITY–II
('57', 330, 7, 25, 559867) November 5, 1932 A correspondent, in spite of having received liberal education suggests that before Harijans are put on a level with caste Hindus, they should become fit for such reception, shed their dirty habits, give up eating carrion; another goes the length of saying that Bhangis and Chamars who are engaged in what he considers are, ‘dirty occupations’ should give them up.
('57', 330, 7, 26, 560249) These critics forget that caste men are responsible for whatever bad habits are to be observed amongst the Harijans.
('57', 330, 7, 27, 560366) The so called higher castes have deprived them of facilities for keeping themselves clean and also the incentive for doing so.
('57', 330, 7, 28, 560493) As for the occupations of scavenging and tanning, they are no more dirty than many other occupations I can name.
('57', 330, 7, 29, 560606) What may be
('57', 331, 0, 1, 560618) 332 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 331, 1, 2, 560660) admitted is that these occupations like several others are carried on in a dirty manner.
('57', 331, 1, 3, 560749) That again is due to the high handed indifference and criminal neglect of the ‘high castes’.
('57', 331, 1, 4, 560842) I can say from personal experience that both scavenging and tanning can be done in a perfectly healthy and clean manner.
('57', 331, 1, 5, 560963) Every mother is a scavenger in regard to her own children and every student of modern medicine is a tanner in as much as he has to dissect and skin human carcases.
('57', 331, 1, 6, 561127) But we consider theirs to be sacred occupations.
('57', 331, 1, 7, 561176) I submit that the ordinary scavengers’ and tanners’ occupations are no less sacred and no less useful than those of mothers and medical men.
('57', 331, 1, 8, 561317) We shall go wrong if caste men regard themselves as patrons distributing favours to the Harijans.
('57', 331, 1, 9, 561415) Whatever is done now by the caste Hindus for the Harijans will be but a tardy reparation for the wrongs done to them for generations, and if now they have to be received in their existing state, as they must be received, it is a well deserved punishment for the past guilt.
('57', 331, 1, 10, 561689) But there is this certain satisfaction that the very act of receiving them with open hearts would be a sufficient incentive to cleanliness, and the caste men will for their own comfort and convenience provide Harijans with facilities for keeping themselves clean.
('57', 331, 1, 11, 561953) It is well to remind ourselves of what wrongs we have heaped upon the devoted heads of the Harijans.
('57', 331, 1, 12, 562054) Socially they are lepers.
('57', 331, 1, 13, 562080) Economically they are worse than slaves.
('57', 331, 1, 14, 562121) Religiously they are denied entrance to places we miscall ‘houses of God’.
('57', 331, 1, 15, 562196) They are denied the use, on the same terms as the caste men, of public roads, public hospitals, public wells, public taps, public parks and the like, and in some cases their approach within a measured distance is a social crime, and in some other rare enough cases their very sight is an offence.
('57', 331, 1, 16, 562493) They are relegated for their residence to the worst quarters of cities or villages where they practically get no social services.
('57', 331, 1, 17, 562623) Caste Hindu lawyers and doctors will not serve them as they do other members of society.
('57', 331, 1, 18, 562712) Brahmins will not officiate at their religious functions.
('57', 331, 1, 19, 562770) The wonder is that they are at all able to eke out an existence or that they still remain within the Hindu fold.
('57', 331, 1, 20, 562883) They are too downtrodden to rise in revolt against their suppressors.
('57', 331, 1, 21, 562953) I have recalled these tragic and shameful facts in order to make the workers vividly realize the implications of the Yeravda Pact.
('57', 331, 1, 22, 563084) It is only ceaseless effort that can raise these downtrodden fellow beings from degradation, purify Hinduism, and raise the whole Hindu society and with it the whole of India.
('57', 332, 0, 1, 563260) VOL. 57 : 5 SEPTEMBER, 1932 15 NOVEMBER, 1932 333
('57', 332, 1, 2, 563310) Let us not be stunned by this simple recital of the wrongs.
('57', 332, 1, 3, 563370) If the demonstration during the last week was a genuine expression of repentance on the part of caste Hindus, all will be well, and every Harijan will soon feel the glow of freedom.
('57', 332, 1, 4, 563552) But before this much desired end can be achieved the message of freedom will have to be carried to the remotest village.
('57', 332, 1, 5, 563673) Indeed the work in the village is far more difficult than in the big cities where it is possible quickly to mobilize public opinion.
('57', 332, 1, 6, 563806) Now that there is the All India Anti untouchability League, workers should work in co ordination with that League.
('57', 332, 1, 7, 563921) And here I would like to recall what Dr. Ambedkar told me.
('57', 332, 1, 8, 563980) He said, “Let there be no repetition of the old method when the reformer claimed to know more of the requirements of his victims than the victims themselves”, and therefore, he added “tell your workers to ascertain from the representatives of the Harijans what their first need is and how they would like it to be satisfied.
('57', 332, 1, 9, 564305) Joint refreshments are good enough by way of demonstration, but they may be overdone.
('57', 332, 1, 10, 564391) There is a flavour of patronage about them.
('57', 332, 1, 11, 564435) I would not attend them by myself.
('57', 332, 1, 12, 564470) The more dignified procedure would be to invite us to ordinary social functions without any fuss.
('57', 332, 1, 13, 564568) Even temple entry, good and necessary as it is, may wait.
('57', 332, 1, 14, 564626) The crying need is the raising of the economic status and decent behaviour in the daily contact.” I must not repeat here some of the harrowing details given by him from his own bitter experiences.
('57', 332, 1, 15, 564823) I felt the force of his remarks.
('57', 332, 1, 16, 564856) I hope every one of my readers will do likewise.
('57', 332, 1, 17, 564905) Many suggestions have been sent to me for adoption by the reformers.
('57', 332, 1, 18, 564974) One is a repetition of what Swami Shraddhanandji used to repeat so often, namely, that every Hindu should have in his home a Harijan who would be for all practical purposes a member of the family.
('57', 332, 1, 19, 565171) The second comes from a non Hindu friend deeply interested in India’s welfare.
('57', 332, 1, 20, 565250) He says that every well to do Hindu should bear the expense of giving, if possible under his own observation, higher education to a Harijan young man or girl so that these after finishing their education might work for the uplift of fellow Harijans.
('57', 332, 1, 21, 565500) Both the suggestions are worthy of consideration and adoption.
('57', 332, 1, 22, 565563) I would ask all who have made fruitful suggestions to pass them on to the newly established League.
('57', 332, 1, 23, 565663) Correspondents should recognize my limitations.
('57', 332, 1, 24, 565711) From behind the prison gates, I can only tender advice to the League and the people.
('57', 332, 1, 25, 565796) I can take no part in the real execution of plans.
('57', 332, 1, 26, 565847) They should also recognize that my opinions, based as they must be on insufficient data, and often on second hand information, are liable to
('57', 333, 0, 1, 565988) 334 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 333, 1, 2, 566030) revision in the light of new facts and should, therefore, be received with caution.
('57', 333, 1, 3, 566114) Though it is now past history I would devote a paragraph to the objection raised by a correspondent and even voiced in suppressed tones in the Press.
('57', 333, 1, 4, 566264) Referring to the political part of the Pact they ask, ‘What have you gained by it?
('57', 333, 1, 5, 566347) The Harijans have surely got much more than the Prime Minister gave’.
('57', 333, 1, 6, 566417) Well, that is exactly the gain.
('57', 333, 1, 7, 566449) My objection to the decision was that it gave stone instead of bread.
('57', 333, 1, 8, 566519) This Pact has given bits of bread.
('57', 333, 1, 9, 566554) I personally would have rejoiced with Dr. Moonje if the Harijans had got all the seats allotted to the Hindus.
('57', 333, 1, 10, 566665) That would have been the greatest gain to caste Hindus and Hinduism.
('57', 333, 1, 11, 566734) What I wanted and what I still want is their complete merger in the caste Hindus and the latter’s in the former.
('57', 333, 1, 12, 566847) It is my deliberate opinion, not likely to be altered by any fresh fact that may come to light, that the more the suppressors give to the suppressed the more they gain.
('57', 333, 1, 13, 567016) They gain pro tanto discharge from overdue debts.
('57', 333, 1, 14, 567066) Unless the caste Hindus approach the question in that humble, penitent, religious and right spirit, the remaining part of the Pact will never be observed in the spirit that seemed to pervade Hindu society during the fast week.
('57', 333, 1, 15, 567293) I would like to tender my congratulations to those Princes who have opened their State temples to the Harijans and have otherwise proclaimed banishment of untouchability from their States.
('57', 333, 1, 16, 567482) If I may say it, they have thereby done some penance on their own behalf and their people’s.
('57', 333, 1, 17, 567575) I hope that the Hindus residing in these States will carry out the terms of these proclamations and so fraternize with them as to make the Harijans feel that they never were the despised outcastes of Hindu humanity.
('57', 333, 1, 18, 567791) We are too near the scene of tragedy to realize that this canker of untouchability has travelled far beyond its prescribed limits and has sapped the foundations of the whole nation.
('57', 333, 1, 19, 567973) The touch me not spirit pervades the atmosphere.
('57', 333, 1, 20, 568022) If, therefore, this white ant is touched at its source, I feel sure that we shall soon forget the differences with regard to caste and caste and religion and religion and begin to believe that even as all Hindus are one and indivisible, so are all Hindus, Mussalmans, Sikhs, Parsis, Jews and Christians, branches of the same parent tree.
('57', 333, 1, 21, 568360) Though religions are many, Religion is one.
('57', 333, 1, 22, 568404) That is the lesson I would have us learn from the campaign against untouchability.
('57', 333, 1, 23, 568487) And we will learn it, if we prosecute it in the religious spirit with a determination that will not be resisted.

('57', 334, 2, 4, 568816) 1 It is God’s.
('57', 334, 2, 5, 568831) But God has given it to you for the time being to keep it clean and healthy and use it for His service.
('57', 334, 2, 6, 568935) You are therefore the trustee, not the owner.
('57', 334, 2, 7, 568981) An owner may abuse or misuse his property.
('57', 334, 2, 8, 569024) A trustee or keeper has to be very careful and make the best use of the property left to his care.
('57', 334, 2, 9, 569123) So whilst you must not be anxious about the body you have to take every care you can of it.
('57', 334, 2, 10, 569215) God will take it away when He wishes.

('57', 334, 5, 13, 569325) November 5, 1932 I have endeavoured to explain the position 2 in the Press state ment which you must have seen.
('57', 334, 5, 14, 569437) I wonder whether it gives you satis faction.
('57', 334, 5, 15, 569482) I draw, as I have always done, a sharp distinction between castes and varnas.
('57', 334, 5, 16, 569560) Castes are inumerable and in their present condition they are a drag upon Hinduism.
('57', 334, 5, 17, 569644) Therefore you and I do not observe caste distinctions.
('57', 334, 5, 18, 569699) Varna stands on a different footing, and it means profession.
('57', 334, 5, 19, 569761) It has nothing to do with inter dining and intermarriage.
('57', 334, 5, 20, 569819) People belonging to the four professions used formely to inter dine and even to intermarry and by so doing they naturally could not and did not leave their varna.
('57', 334, 5, 21, 569982) This is absolutely clear from the definitions of the different varnas in the Bhagavad Gita.
('57', 334, 5, 22, 570074) A man falls from his varna when he abandons his hereditary profession.
('57', 334, 5, 23, 570145) Today, however, varnashrama is a lost treasure and there is utter confusion.
('57', 334, 5, 24, 570222) Therefore so far as I can see there is only one varna and that is Shudra.
('57', 334, 5, 25, 570296) That there is confusion of varnas is humiliating.
('57', 334, 5, 26, 570346) That we should call ourselves Shudras is no humiliation, for in religion there is none high and none low.
('57', 334, 5, 27, 570452) Profession of Shudra is just as honourable and necessary as that of Brahmin.
('57', 334, 5, 28, 570529) Equally so of Kshatriya and Vaishya.
('57', 334, 5, 29, 570566) But even if it should hurt our pride to consider ourselves as Shudra, there is no escape from it as a moment’s reflection will show.
('57', 334, 5, 30, 570699) This fortunate circumstance if it is generally accepted solves the difficulty

('57', 335, 1, 2, 570912) of ranking the Harijans.
('57', 335, 1, 3, 570937) To what varna, should they belong on admission?
('57', 335, 1, 4, 570985) If we say, ‘to the Shudra varna’ we immediately accept the gradation in varna dharma and the Harijans will have every right to resent the lowest rank being given to them.
('57', 335, 1, 5, 571156) If we are all Shudras there is no difficulty left.
('57', 335, 1, 6, 571207) I remember a learned Shastri in 1915 suggesting at a Social Reform gathering in Nellore that there was confusion of varnas and that as originally there was only one varna, viz., that of Brahmins, we should all now call ourselves Brahmins.
('57', 335, 1, 7, 571446) I could not reconcile myself to that proposition then and I could do so less now.
('57', 335, 1, 8, 571528) Whilst we can all serve and hence be called Shudras, we do not all posses learning nor do we posses divine knowledge.
('57', 335, 1, 9, 571646) Therefore it would be untruthful to regard ourselves as Brahmins.
('57', 335, 1, 10, 571712) If we rob inter dining and intermarriage of religious significance in the manner it is understood, it becomes purely a matter of option, where we dine and where our children marry.
('57', 335, 1, 11, 571893) And removal of untouchability would then have exactly the meaning I have always given it.
('57', 335, 1, 12, 571983) This ought to be quite clear.

('57', 337, 2, 3, 574051) November 5, 1932 I was glad to get your letter.
('57', 337, 2, 4, 574099) Let me know more about yourself.
('57', 337, 2, 5, 574132) How much Sanskrit have you studied?
('57', 337, 2, 6, 574168) For how many years?
('57', 337, 2, 7, 574188) What is your age?
('57', 337, 2, 8, 574206) How long have you been teaching?
('57', 337, 2, 9, 574239) What is the number of boys studying Sanskrit and how many are Muslims and how many Hindus?
('57', 337, 2, 10, 574330) Are your parents living?
('57', 337, 2, 11, 574355) If so, what is your father’s occupation?
('57', 337, 2, 12, 574396) Now I shall attempt to answer your queries.
('57', 337, 2, 13, 574440) The special feature of Hinduism is that it permits considerable freedom of thought.
('57', 337, 2, 14, 574524) And since tolerance towards other religions is implicit in it, Hindus may adopt such good points as they find in other religions.
('57', 337, 2, 15, 574654) Indeed it is their duty to do so.
('57', 337, 2, 16, 574688) That is why the exegesis of Hindu scriptures isever developing.
('57', 337, 2, 17, 574752) There is nothing new in what I have said regarding the characters of the Mahabharata and the Gita.
('57', 337, 2, 18, 574851) I have taken it from the commentaries.
('57', 337, 2, 19, 574890) The idea has been very well developed by Sadanand Mishra in his commentary on the Gita.
('57', 337, 2, 20, 574978) I am told that some Prakrit works contain similar views.
('57', 337, 2, 21, 575035) Not all that is contained in works popularly known as Hindu scritpures is gospel truth, and it is not necessary for the Hindus to accept everything laid down in the scriptures.
('57', 337, 2, 22, 575212) I am in no way prepared to accept as religion, even though it might have a historical basis, the punishment of pouring molten lead into the ears of the Shudra listening to Vedic recitations.
('57', 337, 2, 23, 575403) And there are innumerable Hindus who do not accept it as religious injunction.
('57', 337, 2, 24, 575482) There is one simple test laid down in Hinduism which even a child can understand: anything which is not acceptable to reason, anything which goes contrary to reason cannot be religion; so also anything that violates truth and ahimsa.
('57', 337, 2, 25, 575716) Now for the Yeravda Pact.
('57', 337, 2, 26, 575742) To me at any rate votes were no consideration.
('57', 337, 2, 27, 575789) To me the question was one of undoing the harm that had been done to Harijans by the declaration of the British Cabinet.
('57', 337, 2, 28, 575910) What explanation can I give you about my fast?
('57', 337, 2, 29, 575957) I can only say that it was inspired by God and that I could not have avoided it.

('57', 338, 2, 3, 576171) November 5, 1932 1
('57', 338, 3, 4, 576190) BHAI HANUMANPRASAD, I have your letter.
('57', 338, 3, 5, 576230) It does not matter that it is long.
('57', 338, 3, 6, 576266) I shall make good use of it.
('57', 338, 3, 7, 576295) What you write about Devdas becomes you.
('57', 338, 3, 8, 576336) I still stand by my statements which you have quoted from Navajivan.
('57', 338, 3, 9, 576405) To understand what I say one needs to understand my conduct for I try to avoid saying anything that contradicts my conduct and doing anything contrary to what I say.
('57', 338, 3, 10, 576571) And I admit my own weakness when ever my conduct is inconsistent with the opinion I express.
('57', 338, 3, 11, 576664) Here I do not see any inconsistency between my profession and my conduct.
('57', 338, 3, 12, 576738) Those who taunt and slander sanatanists commit himsa and undoubtedly injure the cause of the removal of untouchability.
('57', 338, 3, 13, 576858) Thiswhole work is purely religious and should be performed in a religious spirit.
('57', 338, 3, 14, 576940) Those sanatanists who see untouchability as a part of religion should not be subjected to attacks of any kind.
('57', 338, 3, 15, 577051) They have as much right to stand firm on their belief as we have to stand on ours.
('57', 338, 3, 16, 577134) Even in inter dining, cleanliness and some code of conduct are always desirable.
('57', 338, 3, 17, 577215) It is a sin to use coercion in this matter or to despise those who refuse to inter dine.
('57', 338, 3, 18, 577304) Similarly to force one’s way into the temples against the wishes of the trustees is an act of sin.
('57', 338, 3, 19, 577403) And even if the Harijans should manage to enter the temples in this manner and some Hindus should inter dine with them, I would never accept it as removal of untouchability.
('57', 338, 3, 20, 577577) Rather than be a witness to such reform I would prefer death, because I am convinced that complusion can neither remove untouchability nor safeguard Hinduism.
('57', 338, 3, 21, 577736) Let me make myself clear: I am not opposed to inter dining in any way and I consider it adharma for anyone to refuse to eat in the company of a person out of contempt for him or on account of his birth.
('57', 338, 3, 22, 577939) Assuredly it would be an exaggeration to assert that dining together necessarily promotes friendly feeling.
('57', 338, 3, 23, 578047) But to refuse to dine with someone who is clean and is a vegetarian because he follows another religion or he belongs to another province or is an untou chable, would be adharma.
('57', 338, 3, 24, 578226) It cannot be considered proper to attribute to the untouchables as such insanitation and such other defects and to refuse to dine with them.
('57', 338, 3, 25, 578367) We must bear in mind one thing if we are to consider the question in a religious spirit.
('57', 338, 3, 26, 578456) The caste Hindus, having created a class of outcastes, have up to the present day been treating

('57', 339, 1, 2, 578643) them in a most irreligious and brutal manner.
('57', 339, 1, 3, 578689) This has caused uncleanliness and other vices to creep in among them.
('57', 339, 1, 4, 578759) Sooner or later the Hindus have to atone for it.
('57', 339, 1, 5, 578808) The time has now come when we can no longer deprive them of temple entry, etc., by attributing to them vices of which we ourselves were the cause.
('57', 339, 1, 6, 578955) Our atonement consists in meeting them as they are, allowing them to enter the temples and behaving decently with them.
('57', 339, 1, 7, 579075) We must have the faith that our contact will exercise a purfying influence on their habits and that they too will make an effort to that end.
('57', 339, 1, 8, 579217) There is no other way of reforming them and of the caste Hindus doing atonement.
('57', 339, 1, 9, 579298) It is essential to remember that uncleanliness and similar short comings found in Harijans are common to lacs of other Hindus who are not prevented on that accout from entering the temples or joining other public institutions.
('57', 339, 1, 10, 579525) Why should we sit in judgement on the Harijans?
('57', 339, 1, 11, 579573) Ultimately to whom does God belong?
('57', 339, 1, 12, 579609) Does He belong to the meritorious and the rich or to thesinners who can hardly lisp His name.
('57', 339, 1, 13, 579703) We must not judge others.
('57', 339, 1, 14, 579729) Our duty is to judge ourselves.
('57', 339, 1, 15, 579761) Read and ponder calmly over what I have written and if still there is anything to ask, do not hesitate to ask me.
('57', 339, 1, 16, 579875) I want to satisfy you, and that from self interest for I expect a great deal of work from you in this cause.
('57', 339, 1, 17, 579984) To me the question is purely a religious one and I want full co operation from religious minded people like you.
('57', 339, 1, 18, 580097) How long will you be in Ratangarh?

('57', 339, 4, 22, 580304) The letter which I wrote to calm you only upset you.
('57', 339, 4, 23, 580357) I have already declared my faith in you.
('57', 339, 4, 24, 580398) How can I forsake a daughter who became such to me on her own?
('57', 339, 4, 25, 580461) I believe that I have always protected you, and will continue to do so.
('57', 339, 4, 26, 580533) Do not worry at all.
('57', 339, 4, 27, 580554) God will assuredly lead you to your good.
('57', 339, 4, 28, 580596) But have patience and be calm.
('57', 339, 4, 29, 580627) Do not be greedy.
('57', 339, 4, 30, 580645) Continue to write to me.

('57', 340, 2, 3, 580862) November 6, 1932
('57', 340, 3, 4, 580879) DEAR BOYS AND GIRLS, I got Sharda’s letter giving a beautiful description of how you enjoyed the five holidays.
('57', 340, 3, 5, 580991) I can give only a short reply to it.
('57', 340, 3, 6, 581028) Harijan work now takes up a great deal of my time, so that neither much time nor enough strength is left to me to write a long letter to you.
('57', 340, 3, 7, 581170) You also should do whatever service you can to Harijans.

('57', 340, 8, 11, 581320) JAMNA, Your letters please me.
('57', 340, 8, 12, 581351) Keep up the fearlessness which you show in them.
('57', 340, 8, 13, 581400) I thought you kept better health in Rajkot.
('57', 340, 8, 14, 581444) If you keep well in the Ashram both mentally and physically, I would not like you to leave it even for a moment.

('57', 340, 12, 17, 581637) November 6, 1932
('57', 340, 13, 18, 581654) KESHU, You have asked me why I felt unhappy to learn that Ba had kept the spinning wheel for herself.
('57', 340, 13, 19, 581756) I have so much faith in you and in your impartiality that I readily tell you the reason.
('57', 340, 13, 20, 581845) I was happy that Santok wished to use my spinning wheel.
('57', 340, 13, 21, 581902) Ba’s wish to have it made me unhappy because I smelt jealously in it.
('57', 340, 13, 22, 581972) I have assumed in this that she knew that that spinning wheel was earmarked for Santok.
('57', 340, 13, 23, 582060) If my assumption is not correct, I must say that I have done great injustice to Ba.
('57', 340, 13, 24, 582144) She has suffered so much at my hands in the past that I could not bring myself to ask her about the matter.
('57', 340, 13, 25, 582252) You will understand that I was doubly unhappy.
('57', 340, 13, 26, 582299) Santok did not get the spinning wheel and Ba showed jealousy.
('57', 340, 13, 27, 582361) But how could we alter what was destined to happen?
('57', 341, 0, 1, 582413) 342 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 341, 1, 2, 582455) Do not feel even inwardly angry with Ba.
('57', 341, 1, 3, 582496) I know I need not tell you even this.
('57', 341, 1, 4, 582534) If you have as much goodness in you as I want you to have, go to Ba and say to her: ‘I had asked for this spinning wheel from Bapu for my mother, and Bapu had promised it.
('57', 341, 1, 5, 582706) I will get a new one made for you.
('57', 341, 1, 6, 582741) Will you kindly give me this?’ This is worth doing provided you have courage enough.
('57', 341, 1, 7, 582826) I spin with the slivers sent by you.
('57', 341, 1, 8, 582863) I find them quite good.
('57', 341, 1, 9, 582887) There is one defect in them: they are very hard.
('57', 341, 1, 10, 582936) That was the experience of both of us.
('57', 341, 1, 11, 582975) From one tola of cotton, we should make thirty two soft slivers.
('57', 341, 2, 12, 583040) BAPU [PS.] Mahadev believes that Ba did not know.
('57', 341, 2, 13, 583090) I would be very happy if that was so.
('57', 341, 2, 14, 583128) All the same, I should like you to go and see her.

('57', 341, 5, 17, 583265) November 6, 1932
('57', 341, 6, 18, 583282) NARANDAS, I got the mail from you in due time.
('57', 341, 6, 19, 583329) I understand what you say about Champa.
('57', 341, 6, 20, 583369) If it is necessary to get the bungalow painted, you may do so.
('57', 341, 6, 21, 583432) Let me know how much it will cost to put up a stone fence.
('57', 341, 6, 22, 583491) At the present time whom else need you ask for permission?
('57', 341, 6, 23, 583550) The brothers 1 are in no fit state of mind to think about such matters, and so it is I who will have to decide.
('57', 341, 6, 24, 583662) But as I am dictating these lines Mahadev reminds me about the necessity to secure permission from the Govenment.
('57', 341, 6, 25, 583776) He believes that that is what you have referred to.
('57', 341, 6, 26, 583828) I do not think you mean that.
('57', 341, 6, 27, 583858) All the same, you should ascertain whether such permission is necessary for putting up a stone or brick wall.
('57', 341, 6, 28, 583968) In that case, we shall have to decide two questions: whether, if the expense is too much, we should incur it, and, if the Government’s permission is necessary, whether we should apply for it at the present time.
('57', 341, 6, 29, 584180) I hope Mohan’s fever has now completely left him.
('57', 341, 6, 30, 584230) Even then, it will be necessary to nurse him carefully for some time.
('57', 341, 6, 31, 584300) I cannot overcome my fear about Kusum.

('57', 342, 1, 2, 584455) cannot control her mind.
('57', 342, 1, 3, 584480) I have written a letter to you about her and Bhau, which I suppose you will have got before you get this.
('57', 342, 1, 4, 584586) After writing that letter, I also wrote a postcard to Kusum.
('57', 342, 1, 5, 584647) If you have not already discussed with Bhau the subject about which he wrote to me, do so now.
('57', 342, 1, 6, 584742) I have still not heard from Dr. Talwalkar.
('57', 342, 1, 7, 584785) Ramniklal’s and Joshi’s letters were received, but they were kept back here.
('57', 342, 1, 8, 584862) I had detailed information about Jamnalal.
('57', 342, 1, 9, 584905) His health cannot be described as very good.
('57', 342, 2, 10, 584950) Read my letter to Ratubhai.
('57', 342, 2, 11, 584978) Persuade him to go to Rangoon immediately.
('57', 342, 2, 12, 585021) After reading Bhau’s letter this is what I think.
('57', 342, 2, 13, 585071) The food which prisoners get in South Africa is wholesome from the point of view of health and self control.
('57', 342, 2, 14, 585180) In the Ashram, we serve at break fast whole wheat flour boiled in water and with jaggery mixed in it.
('57', 342, 2, 15, 585282) Here they give to every prisoner gruel of five tolas of jowar flour with salt.
('57', 342, 2, 16, 585361) This experiment seems worth trying there.
('57', 342, 2, 17, 585403) Perhaps we may not be able to digest five tolas of flour.
('57', 342, 2, 18, 585461) We can start with 2 1/2 tolas.
('57', 342, 2, 19, 585492) Salt is better than jaggery.
('57', 342, 2, 20, 585521) Moreover, by replacing jaggery with salt we shall put ourselves in the same condition as the prisoners.
('57', 342, 2, 21, 585625) Rice may be served on alternate days instead of daily as now.
('57', 342, 2, 22, 585687) It follows that dal also should be served on alternate days.
('57', 342, 2, 23, 585748) In the jails in South Africa, they served dal only on two days in a week, and that too with one meal only.
('57', 342, 2, 24, 585855) Vegetable should be served daily.
('57', 342, 2, 25, 585889) Mostly it should be leaves.
('57', 342, 2, 26, 585917) It would be better if only one vegetable was served every day.
('57', 342, 2, 27, 585980) It may change from day to day.
('57', 342, 2, 28, 586011) In South Africa, they served in the evening the same kind of gruel which they did in the morning.
('57', 342, 2, 29, 586109) I am sure that there would be no difficulty if we followed the same practice.
('57', 342, 2, 30, 586187) Discuss this suggestion with others.
('57', 342, 2, 31, 586224) The food which the well to do outside and we in the Ashram eat certainly does not keep us healthy.
('57', 342, 2, 32, 586323) In jail a good proportion of prisoners maintain good health.
('57', 342, 2, 33, 586384) Why cannot we make suitable modifications and discover a diet which would be conducive to self control and help to pre serve our health?
('57', 342, 2, 34, 586521) Just now our chief motive for doing this should be to live in the same way as the prisoners do and thereby learn greater self control.
('57', 342, 2, 35, 586656) Even if we adopt these suggestions, we shall retain ghee and milk, which prisoners do not get.
('57', 342, 2, 36, 586751) I am at any rate convinced that we do not need rice very much, and also that, if we consume milk and ghee, we do not need much dal either.
('57', 342, 2, 37, 586890) If whole wheat flour, milk and green vegetables are available, we need little else.
('57', 342, 2, 38, 586974) Yes, I do believe that some fruit in the
('57', 343, 0, 1, 587015) 344 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 343, 1, 2, 587057) diet is essential.
('57', 343, 1, 3, 587076) It is desirable, and even necessary, that everybody should get sour lemons, tomatoes, radish, carrots, radish pods, etc., in small quantities and uncooked.
('57', 343, 1, 4, 587232) Besides ghee, we may use fresh oil also.
('57', 343, 1, 5, 587273) If you feel interested in these sugges tions, discuss them with other people.
('57', 343, 1, 6, 587351) Introduce, by way of experiment, such changes as appeal to you.
('57', 343, 1, 7, 587415) And the rest you may discuss with me in your letters.
('57', 343, 1, 8, 587469) Actually, I have been thinking about many other changes.
('57', 343, 1, 9, 587526) I have mentioned here only a few more important ones from among them.
('57', 343, 1, 10, 587596) If you wish, I will discuss the others too.
('57', 343, 1, 11, 587640) If you ultimately decide to introduce any of these changes, you will have of course to discuss them with the others.
('57', 343, 1, 12, 587757) However, if you feel that even a tentative discussion of them will upset the people, you may leave them aside.
('57', 343, 1, 13, 587868) I would certainly not press you to experiment with any changes, since I cannot be there to help in implementing them.
('57', 343, 1, 14, 587986) I go on making such suggestions to you, knowing that they are not likely to frighten you.
('57', 343, 1, 15, 588076) In all there are 46 letters, 41 tied in a bundle and 5 separate.

('57', 343, 6, 19, 588274) RAMA, I hope you got the letter which I wrote to you after the last post and have started acting as I advised.
('57', 343, 6, 20, 588385) Not to show anger against anger or speak ill of one who speaks ill of us, but to meet anger with patience, to speak well of one who speaks ill of us and to do good in return for evil—this is dharma and this is the ideal which guides our relations in the Ashram.
('57', 343, 6, 21, 588647) See that you do not stray from it.

('57', 344, 2, 3, 588855) November 6, 1932
('57', 344, 3, 4, 588872) PREMA, The burden on me is so heavy now that I cannot possibly write long letters to the Ashram.
('57', 344, 3, 5, 588969) You will be the first victim.
('57', 344, 3, 6, 588999) But I know that you will be satisfied to read the long letters I shall be writing in the journal.
('57', 344, 3, 7, 589097) After reading the different accounts of the Diwali days there, I felt like flying away from here to be in your midst.
('57', 344, 3, 8, 589215) But I found that the cage was closed on all sides.
('57', 344, 3, 9, 589266) So I merely fluttered my wings and remained where I was.
('57', 344, 3, 10, 589323) If you increase butter in your diet and improve your health, I think the medicine would be cheap enough.
('57', 344, 3, 11, 589428) I know that your responsibilities are increasing.
('57', 344, 3, 12, 589478) God will protect you.
('57', 344, 3, 13, 589500) Do not give up faith in yourself.
('57', 344, 3, 14, 589534) My only advice to you is that you should not lose patience.
('57', 344, 3, 15, 589594) Ramabehn has made one complaint, which seems to be justified.
('57', 344, 3, 16, 589656) You got irritated and told Dhiru, “You may go to Palanpur”.
('57', 344, 3, 17, 589716) You should not speak thus to anyone.
('57', 344, 3, 18, 589753) One should always be courteous to children.
('57', 344, 3, 19, 589797) If anyone who lives in the Ashram makes a mistake, we insult him if we tell him to leave the Ashram and go his way.
('57', 344, 3, 20, 589913) Take care not to speak thus to anyone and win over Ramabehn.
('57', 344, 3, 21, 589974) Krishnan Nair’s conversation with you was interesting.
('57', 344, 3, 22, 590029) If I had the power of attorney from you, I would have given the very replies which you did.
('57', 344, 3, 23, 590121) You have given a good description of Kisen.
('57', 344, 3, 24, 590165) Our song 1 is the one that becomes us most.
('57', 344, 3, 25, 590209) I cannot analyse the dream.
('57', 344, 3, 26, 590237) Did you understand Narandas’s intention behind the presents which he gave?
('57', 344, 3, 27, 590312) There is no uniform rule for all occasions when one may express the emotion in one’s heart.
('57', 344, 3, 28, 590404) I would say that one may do so when prompted by Satyanarayan 2.

('57', 345, 2, 3, 590669) November 6, 1932
('57', 345, 3, 4, 590686) PARASRAM, I understand about Father.
('57', 345, 3, 5, 590723) You can write about me on these conditions: (1) Your writing should not interfere with the work there.
('57', 345, 3, 6, 590826) (2) You should not write at the cost of your health.
('57', 345, 3, 7, 590879) (3) You should not mention any facts about my life here which the people do not know.
('57', 345, 3, 8, 590965) (4) You should not let yourself be carried away and become hyperbolical.
('57', 345, 3, 9, 591038) If you have realy put your life in my hands, your statement that you have no joy in life has no meaning—or, if it has any, it is this, that you have put your life in my hands unwillingly and, therefore, it has become uninteresting.
('57', 345, 3, 10, 591270) Anybody who has willingly accepted the pathof service must feel his life to be full of joy, for he finds joy in service itself.
('57', 345, 3, 11, 591398) Grams are pulses.
('57', 345, 3, 12, 591416) No one can digest roti made of gram flour.
('57', 345, 3, 13, 591459) Give up the idea.

('57', 345, 8, 19, 591700) You forgot to mention the name of the village where you have taken up work.
('57', 345, 8, 20, 591776) Mention it in your next letter.
('57', 345, 8, 21, 591808) We can meet the Chamars’ objection.
('57', 345, 8, 22, 591844) I think there is substance in it.
('57', 345, 8, 23, 591878) We should arrange to carry away the carcasses of dead cattle.
('57', 345, 8, 24, 591940) Mention the name of the village, population etc.
('57', 345, 8, 25, 591989) We have started this work in the Ashram with that very aim.
('57', 345, 8, 26, 592049) We can carry away the carcasses in carts.
('57', 345, 8, 27, 592091) It is only a matter of planning and organization.
('57', 345, 8, 28, 592141) I am glad that you have started working among the Harijans.
('57', 345, 8, 29, 592201) Get as much help from the villages as possible and carry on the work.
('57', 345, 8, 30, 592271) Send me detailed report from time to time.
('57', 345, 8, 31, 592314) If necessary, you should devote even more time to the work.

('57', 346, 3, 4, 592511) BHAU, I do not have time to write much today.
('57', 346, 3, 5, 592557) I hope you got the letter which I wrote after the last weekly post.
('57', 346, 3, 6, 592625) I am eager to know the effect of the fast.
('57', 346, 3, 7, 592668) You should know how to resume food gradually after the fast has ended.
('57', 346, 3, 8, 592739) Please remember that in connecting one’s food with dharma one is likely to go to an extreme.

('57', 346, 8, 12, 592964) SHANTA, You seem to be as mischievous as ever.
('57', 346, 8, 13, 593011) A mother who does not listen to her daughter’s complaints is no mother; similarly, a daughter who feels shy in opening her heart to her mother, thinking that she is too busy to listen to her, is no true daughter.
('57', 346, 8, 14, 593224) Even in your long letter to me you have only beaten about the bush.
('57', 346, 8, 15, 593292) Mahadev will, no doubt, agree to guide you, but do you think you will let yourself be controlled by anybody?
('57', 346, 8, 16, 593401) You want to work.
('57', 346, 8, 17, 593419) Well, there is plenty of work even in the Ashram.
('57', 346, 8, 18, 593469) Besides, the Ashram supports all the three of you.
('57', 346, 8, 19, 593520) Why then do you worry?
('57', 346, 8, 20, 593543) If you want paid work, how much more do you expect to earn through it than what you require for your needs?
('57', 346, 8, 21, 593651) You know that, generally, however much a person may earn, he feels that it is too little.
('57', 346, 8, 22, 593741) He always wants to earn a little more.
('57', 346, 8, 23, 593780) It is the aim of the Ashram to cure its inmates of such a desire.
('57', 346, 8, 24, 593846) Are you sure in your heart of hearts that you do not want to have a home of your own?
('57', 346, 8, 25, 593932) I can see even from your letter that whether you know it or not, all your discontent springs from your desire to marry.
('57', 346, 8, 26, 594052) It is not certain, of course, that you will be happy even after marriage.
('57', 346, 8, 27, 594126) To marry, however, is to let yourself be bound.
('57', 346, 8, 28, 594174) Then, the question of happiness or unhappiness does not arise at all.
('57', 346, 8, 29, 594244) So great is the spell of this wonderful thing, marriage.

('57', 347, 1, 2, 594388) whether you want to marry.
('57', 347, 1, 3, 594415) If the answer is no, then, you must remain in the Ashram till your headstrong temper and your childishness disappear.
('57', 347, 1, 4, 594533) If you trust Premabehn, you may talk to her and open your heart.
('57', 347, 1, 5, 594598) You may write to me, too, or to Mahadev, if you wish.
('57', 347, 1, 6, 594652) But please write seriously, to whomsoever you write.
('57', 347, 1, 7, 594705) I was not happy to learn about Kamala’s laziness.
('57', 347, 1, 8, 594755) The remedy I have suggested for Mangala is the only one for her.

('57', 348, 3, 7, 595571) You wrote utasva.

('57', 350, 3, 5, 598224) Your first duty now is to regain your health and strength.
('57', 350, 3, 6, 598283) You should resume work only after you are completely all right.
('57', 350, 3, 7, 598347) Those who take cover behind khadi work out of fear of imprisonment are hypocrites, but those who though convinced of the importance of khadi work prefer to go to jail out of fear of being looked upon as hypocrites, are conceited.
('57', 350, 3, 8, 598577) We should avoid both, such hypocrisy and conceit.

('57', 350, 3, 10, 598722) Your conscience alone can tell you what is best for you now.

('57', 350, 7, 16, 599028) November 7, 1932
('57', 350, 8, 17, 599045) A correspondent whom I know well and who is in sympathy with the movement against untouchability, though he does not accept the whole of the programme, wrote a long letter in Hindi from which I condense the following: I fear that the campaign is not being kept within bounds in all parts of the country.
('57', 350, 8, 18, 599349) I understand in some cases those who claim to be workers in the cause are making use of questi onable methods such as resorting to abuse of adherents of the old order, and pouring ridicule on sacred names.
('57', 350, 8, 19, 599555) Anyone who dares to analyse your sayings or writings or to oppose the
('57', 350, 9, 20, 599625) 1 From the contents it appears that this letter was written before the letter to addressee dated November 7, 1932; vide “Letter to Kapilari M. Mehta”, 7 11 1932 2 Editor, Gujarat Samachar and then Sandesh.

('57', 351, 0, 1, 599929) 352 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 351, 1, 2, 599971) extreme forms that the campaign is taking, immediately becomes a butt of ridicule and is labelled a traitor to his religion and even threatened with dire consequences.
('57', 351, 1, 3, 600139) They do not seem to care for the material or moral welfare of the outcastes.
('57', 351, 1, 4, 600216) They think that their effort begins and ends with promiscuous dinners and marching crowds of Harijans to temples even in defiance of the wishes to the contrary of the trustees.
('57', 351, 1, 5, 600393) I am sure you do not want the movement to degenerate into mere spectacular demonstrations calculated merely to wound the feelings of the orthodox without doing the least service to the Harijans.
('57', 351, 1, 6, 600588) Out of nearly a hundred letters on untouchability received by me during the past month this is the first letter complaining of workers’ conduct bordering on violence.
('57', 351, 1, 7, 600755) I, however, felt the necessity for giving publicity to the complaint, if only out of regard for my correspondent’s warning to workers.
('57', 351, 1, 8, 600890) I know he will not indulge in wilful exaggeration.
('57', 351, 1, 9, 600941) There can be no complusion in matters of religion, I should say in any matter.
('57', 351, 1, 10, 601020) The public know my very strong views against violence in any shape or form against anyone, no matter what his caste, creed, or nationality may be.
('57', 351, 1, 11, 601167) Let those in charge of the movement, therefore, understand that even in their impatience to save me from the prospective fast they may not force the pace by adopting questionable methods.
('57', 351, 1, 12, 601355) If they do so, they will merely hasten my end.
('57', 351, 1, 13, 601402) It would be living death for me to witness the degeneration of the movement on whose behalf, as I believe, God had prompted that little fast.
('57', 351, 1, 14, 601544) The cause of the Harijans and Hinduism will not be served by methods of rabble.
('57', 351, 1, 15, 601624) This is perhaps the biggest religious reform movement in India, if not in the world, involving as it does the well being of nearly sixty million human beings living in serfdom.
('57', 351, 1, 16, 601801) The orthodox section that disapproves of this is entitled to every courtesy and consideration.
('57', 351, 1, 17, 601896) We have to win them by love, by self sacrifice, by perfect self restraint, and by letting purity of our lives produce its own silent effect upon their hearts.
('57', 351, 1, 18, 602055) We must have faith in our truth and love for converting our opponents to our way.
('57', 351, 1, 19, 602137) There is no doubt whatsoever that the deliverance of sixty million human beings from age long suppression will not be brought about by mere showy demonstrations.
('57', 351, 1, 20, 602299) There has to be solid and constructive programme contemplating an attack on all fronts.
('57', 351, 1, 21, 602387) This enterprise requires concentrated energy of thousands of men, women, boys and girls who are actuated by the loftiest of religious motives.
('57', 351, 1, 22, 602530) I would, therefore, respectfully urge those who don’t appreciate the purely religious character of the movement to retire from it.
('57', 351, 1, 23, 602661) Let those who

('57', 352, 1, 2, 602725) have the faith and fervour, be they a few or many, work the movement.
('57', 352, 1, 3, 602795) The removal of untouchability may produce, indeed it will produce, great political consequences; but it is not a political movement.
('57', 352, 1, 4, 602928) It is a movement purely and simply of the purification of Hinduism and that purification can only come through the purest instruments.
('57', 352, 1, 5, 603063) Thanks be to God there are hundreds if not thousands of such instruments working in all parts of India.
('57', 352, 1, 6, 603167) Let impatient sceptics watch, wait and see; but let them not mar the movement by hasty and ill conceived interference even though it may be prompted by laudable motives.

('57', 352, 4, 10, 603437) THE SECRETARY OF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA HOME DEPARTMENT NEW DELHI
('57', 352, 5, 11, 603504) DEAR SIR, My thoughts having been hitherto concentrated simply upon what threatened to be an impasse about untouchability, I was unable to think of any other matter.
('57', 352, 5, 12, 603670) Now that it is happily over, I would like to approach the Government of India on certain decisions of theirs which I have not been able to understand.
('57', 352, 5, 13, 603821) I should, if I may, like to know why my reply telegrams to Maulana Shaukat Ali 1 and Abul Kalam Azad 2 and to Dr. Ansari, expressing my hope of Hindu Muslim unity being achieved, were disallowed.
('57', 352, 5, 14, 604017) I saw in the Press the correspondence between His Excellency the Viceroy and Maulana Shaukat Ali regarding his request for permission to interview me on the same question.
('57', 352, 5, 15, 604189) If the reasons given to him for refusal to let him see me are also the reasons for disallowing my telegrams I fail to see the connection between my association with civil disobedience and Hindu Muslim unity.
('57', 352, 5, 16, 604397) My association with civil disobedience appears to the Government to be bad.
('57', 352, 5, 17, 604473) But I hope my views on Hindu Muslim unity and my desire to promote it do not so appear to them.
('57', 352, 5, 18, 604569) If I am right in my assumption, I can only understand the ban on the interview and my telegrams on the

('57', 353, 1, 2, 604810) supposition that it is a punishment meted out to me and those who would see me or correspond with me, even on matters that have no connection with civil disobedience, only because I would not set aside the dictates of my conscience and my reason and would not dissociate myself from it.
('57', 353, 1, 3, 605097) I hope Government of India have not contemplated any such punishment.
('57', 353, 1, 4, 605167) The Government of India will admit that as a prisoner I have given the authorities willing co operation.
('57', 353, 1, 5, 605272) I should like it also to be intelligent.
('57', 353, 1, 6, 605313) Wherever it is possible, I should know why particular requests are refused.
('57', 353, 1, 7, 605389) So far as in me lies I endeavour to make no unreasonable requests.
('57', 353, 1, 8, 605456) They have been generally either in the interests of my health or of public good as distinguished from selfish gratification.
('57', 353, 1, 9, 605581) So far as the telegrams which are the subject matter of this letter are concerned, they do not now need to be sent.
('57', 353, 1, 10, 605697) But occasions for dealing with public matters outside untouchability and having no connection with civil disobedience will undoubtedly arise.
('57', 353, 1, 11, 605839) I should like therefore not only to know the reasons for the disallowance in the cases mentioned, but also to know the future policy of the Government on similar occasions.
('57', 353, 2, 12, 606012) I remain, Yours faithfully, M. K. GANDHI

('57', 354, 3, 5, 607134) After a long interval, you write a letter.
('57', 354, 3, 6, 607177) You promise that you will not be lazy again, and then forget and break your promise.
('57', 354, 3, 7, 607262) This is bad.
('57', 354, 3, 8, 607275) One should always keep one’s promise, and should never make a promise which one cannot keep.
('57', 354, 3, 9, 607368) You should write a letter every Sunday and post it to the Ashram.
('57', 354, 3, 10, 607434) You should give in it a report of the work done by you during the preceding week, what you studied, what other work you did and how much yarn you spun.
('57', 354, 3, 11, 607586) I hope you know that we should wear khadi even at home.

('57', 354, 9, 16, 607761) NARANDAS, I got the mail from you yesterday, the day of the week on which I usually get it.
('57', 354, 9, 17, 607853) I send with this a letter from Vithal.
('57', 354, 9, 18, 607892) I have replied to him and told him that he should trust you and forget Liladhar.
('57', 354, 9, 19, 607973) If his sense of devotion to his father draws him towards Liladhar, he may join him and find out some means of earning.
('57', 354, 9, 20, 608092) He should not divide his interest between the Ashram and his father.
('57', 354, 9, 21, 608161) If you think you should reply to anything in his letter, you may do so.
('57', 354, 9, 22, 608233) I had a letter from Jethalal too.
('57', 354, 9, 23, 608267) He does admit his mistake.
('57', 354, 9, 24, 608294) But he thinks it was unjust to ask him to leave.
('57', 354, 9, 25, 608343) I see no trace of repentance on his part.
('57', 354, 9, 26, 608385) I have written to him a rather strong letter and told him that, as long as he does not feel sincere repentance, I would not advise him to return to the Ashram.
('57', 354, 9, 27, 608545) But I have also said that, if he can satisfy you and if you wished to take him back, I would not oppose you either.
('57', 354, 9, 28, 608661) I did not wish to waste your time by sending his letter to you, and so tore it up.
('57', 354, 9, 29, 608744) Kanti’s letter was painful to read.
('57', 354, 9, 30, 608780) His body seems to have
('57', 355, 0, 1, 608803) 356 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 355, 1, 2, 608845) become very weak.
('57', 355, 1, 3, 608863) I have, therefore, sent him a wire today and advised him to go to Rajkot.
('57', 355, 1, 4, 608937) I have advised in the same wire that Prema also should get herself operated upon.
('57', 355, 1, 5, 609019) Remember one rule of mine.
('57', 355, 1, 6, 609046) Anybody who gets fever should be given nothing to eat except fruit.
('57', 355, 1, 7, 609114) If it is necessary that he should be given some nourishing food, he should be given milk only.
('57', 355, 1, 8, 609209) If this rule is not followed and if the fever afterwards turns out to be typhoid, the consequences can be dangerous.
('57', 355, 1, 9, 609326) I also repeat one rule which I have mentioned concerning the experiments in food which are going on.
('57', 355, 1, 10, 609427) Anybody who finds that a certain item upsets him, may stop eating it for a day or two, and not ask for anything in its place.
('57', 355, 1, 11, 609553) If this is done, most probably the thing will agree with him afterwards.
('57', 355, 1, 12, 609626) I am sure you must have got Madan’s book now.

('57', 355, 5, 16, 609831) November 7, 1932 Since you do not like the name Kahandas, may I conclude that you do not like the name Ramdas, either?
('57', 355, 5, 17, 609950) You should then find a new name for Ramdas also—a man of thirty two.
('57', 355, 5, 18, 610019) As Ramdas himself is a das, he will like a name only if it ends in das.
('57', 355, 5, 19, 610091) But choosing such a name will not help.
('57', 355, 5, 20, 610131) After all, it is you I should please.
('57', 355, 5, 21, 610169) Suppose we chose the name Nirmaldas?
('57', 355, 5, 22, 610206) How would you like it?
('57', 355, 5, 23, 610229) Or Nirmallal?
('57', 355, 5, 24, 610243) Send me some other names also which you like.
('57', 355, 5, 25, 610289) And a new one for Ramdas too.
('57', 355, 5, 26, 610319) One should not meet anger with anger or repay ill with ill.
('57', 355, 5, 27, 610379) One should meet anger with forbearance, repay ill with good, abuse with love and injury with kindness.
('57', 355, 5, 28, 610482) That is dharma and that is the rule followed in the Ashram.
('57', 355, 5, 29, 610542) Take care that neither of you depart from it.

('57', 356, 1, 2, 610712) 603. LETTER TO RAMDAS GANDHI
('57', 356, 2, 3, 610741) November 7, 1932 I am replying to your letter today.
('57', 356, 2, 4, 610794) I had wanted to reply to it much earlier, but while searching for verses [from the Gita] as desired by you, I thought that it would be better if I selected at one time all such verses which you could follow in life without difficulty.
('57', 356, 2, 5, 611029) I could do that today, and send with this the verses which I have selected.
('57', 356, 2, 6, 611105) I have mentioned the chapter and number of the verse in each case, so that you can also look up the Gita and see where the verse occurs.
('57', 356, 2, 7, 611242) You will see that all the verses appeal directly to the heart and are easy even for children to understand, and also that the Lord has assured not once but several times that He himself will awaken knowledge in the man who cultivates bhakti for Him and will provide his needs.
('57', 356, 2, 8, 611519) Bhakti means selfless service of every living creature, in all of whom dwells the Lord.
('57', 356, 2, 9, 611607) This includes repetition of Ramanama for one’s own peace of mind.
('57', 356, 2, 10, 611673) Moreover, you will see that even the verses selected from Chapter VI contain what I wish to teach you just now.
('57', 356, 2, 11, 611785) The verses from Chapter XI are the sublimest part of Arjuna’s sublime praise of the Lord.
('57', 356, 2, 12, 611875) And the last verse of Chapter XVIII explains the reward of studying the Gita and of an earnest effort to put its teaching into practice.
('57', 356, 2, 13, 612012) That is, where there is Shri Krishna, who stands for perfect knowledge, and Arjuna, who stands for action informed with knowledge, everything else will follow.
('57', 356, 2, 14, 612172) If you meditate over these verses, you will see that one must never worry.
('57', 356, 2, 15, 612247) A student of the Gita ought not to worry any time.
('57', 356, 2, 16, 612298) We are enjoined to offer up everything as sacrifice to the Lord.
('57', 356, 2, 17, 612363) Everything means everything without exception.
('57', 356, 2, 18, 612410) Do you think anybody who does that would carry a load of worries in his head?
('57', 356, 2, 19, 612488) You must have discovered by now whether your disturbed digestion is the result of too much thinking and excessive worry, or whether it indicates the necessity of some change in your food.
('57', 356, 2, 20, 612676) Do not be overambitious, either, in your reading and study.
('57', 356, 2, 21, 612736) The resol utions which you have formed in your mind will now go on slowly maturing.
('57', 356, 2, 22, 612820) You will know your strength when you are released.
('57', 356, 2, 23, 612871) Why should you worry now whether or not you will really know it?
('57', 356, 2, 24, 612936) There is no need at all to do so.
('57', 356, 2, 25, 612970) You will find the meanings of the verses in the Anasaktiyoga, and in any case Surendra is there with you.
('57', 356, 2, 26, 613076) Youmay, on your own or on the advice of Surendra or others like him, add some more to the verses which I have selected.
('57', 356, 2, 27, 613196) I had made a
('57', 357, 0, 1, 613209) 358 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 357, 1, 2, 613251) note of the verses which I wished to select.
('57', 357, 1, 3, 613296) While doing so in my copy of the Gita.
('57', 357, 1, 4, 613335) I gave them the title“Ramdas Gita”.
('57', 357, 1, 5, 613371) Let us see how much they help you.
('57', 357, 1, 6, 613406) I will now tell you about something which will amuse you.
('57', 357, 1, 7, 613464) Nimu asked me to suggest a name for your son.
('57', 357, 1, 8, 613510) Sarita has already christened him Kahanji.
('57', 357, 1, 9, 613553) I suggested Kahandas, thinking that it would go well with your name and would also satisfy Sarita’s wish.
('57', 357, 1, 10, 613659) But I should have known that Nimu would not like a name ending with das.
('57', 357, 1, 11, 613732) She disapproved of Kahandas and asked me to suggest another name, but said that if you approved of Kahandas, she also would accept it.
('57', 357, 1, 12, 613867) Vasumati, claiming her right, as aunt, to name the child, wrote to me and said that I, being an old man, would naturally suggest a name which an old man would like, but that she would not approve of any such name.
('57', 357, 1, 13, 614081) She, therefore, asked for a name which would please people in this twentieth century.
('57', 357, 1, 14, 614167) I have replied to her and told her that it was the exclusive right of an aunt to name a baby and that, therefore, she might give the child any name she liked.
('57', 357, 1, 15, 614326) I have suggested a few names for her approval such as Fakkadlal, Chhogalashankh, Lakhtarlal, Bardolikar and Sabarmatiwala.
('57', 357, 1, 16, 614449) 1 In my letter to Nimu, I have suggested Nirmallal, and also told her that, if she did not like the name Kahandas, she was hardly likely to be pleased with the name Ramdas either.
('57', 357, 1, 17, 614629) I have, therefore, asked her to suggest a new name for you too.
('57', 357, 1, 18, 614693) I was about to suggest one but checked myself.
('57', 357, 1, 19, 614740) She should call you Nirmalkant.
('57', 357, 1, 20, 614772) But we would then be going back to the age of the Ramayana, instead of living in the twentieth century, for in that age husbands were known by the names of the wives.
('57', 357, 1, 21, 614939) Ramachandra was called Sitapati, Krishna was called Lakshmikant and Mahadev was called Parvatipati.
('57', 357, 1, 22, 615039) We find a number of such instances.
('57', 357, 1, 23, 615075) If you wish to throw any light on this profound subject, you are welcome to do so.
('57', 357, 1, 24, 615158) You ask how I cultivated non attachment.
('57', 357, 1, 25, 615199) The thing was very easy for me since everything I did was spontaneous, that is, arose naturally from my devotion to truth.
('57', 357, 1, 26, 615322) If one is filled with a desire to serve the whole world, one can easily cultivate non attachment.
('57', 357, 1, 27, 615420) If I had chosen to serve only our family, I would certainly have been filled with ignorant love and even developed attachment.
('57', 357, 1, 28, 615547) I would also have suffered because of illnesses and deaths.
('57', 357, 1, 29, 615607) But suffering runs away from you if you dedicate yourself to the service of the countless
('57', 357, 2, 30, 615697) 1 All these are fanciful and extremely funny names.
('57', 358, 0, 1, 615749) VOL. 57 : 5 SEPTEMBER, 1932 15 NOVEMBER, 1932 359
('57', 358, 1, 2, 615799) millions.
('57', 358, 1, 3, 615809) Over whose illness would you worry and over whose death would you grieve?
('57', 358, 1, 4, 615883) It would be almost impossible to do either.
('57', 358, 1, 5, 615927) However, non attachment does not mean insensitivity, or cruelty, for after all one does wish to serve the people, and, therefore, compassion becomes stronger instead of becoming weaker, and one’s efficiency and concentration in work also increases.
('57', 358, 1, 6, 616176) All these are signs of non attachment.
('57', 358, 1, 7, 616215) Moreover, the beauty of the thing lies in the fact that by serving the world, one does not cease to serve one’s family, for service of the family is included in service of the world.
('57', 358, 1, 8, 616398) I am perfectly sure in my mind that I have served Ba, you and your brothers and other members of the family no whit less than I could have done otherwise.
('57', 358, 1, 9, 616553) The service was pure because attachment was replaced by equality of mind.
('57', 358, 1, 10, 616627) I am sure that none of you has lost anything in consequence and that I myself have gained much.
('57', 358, 1, 11, 616723) Thus I found non attachment easy to cultivate.
('57', 358, 1, 12, 616770) The word anasakti occurred to me when, after I had finished the translation of the Gita, Kaka asked me to suggest a title.
('57', 358, 1, 13, 616893) It is not that I started cultivating non attachment after realizing that, if one wished to serve the whole world, one could do so only with non attachment.
('57', 358, 1, 14, 617049) I understood only gradually that I was acting without attachment.
('57', 358, 1, 15, 617115) Those around me saw that before I did.
('57', 358, 1, 16, 617154) When I returned to India, people started describing me as a karmayogi.
('57', 358, 1, 17, 617225) I used to read and study the Gita even in South Africa.
('57', 358, 1, 18, 617281) But I had not then thought about the meaning of karmayogi.
('57', 358, 1, 19, 617340) But other people saw all that in my life, and afterwards I also felt that their description had truth in it.
('57', 358, 1, 20, 617449) All cannot have such good fortune.
('57', 358, 1, 21, 617484) I had it because I think I have always loved truth right from my childhood.
('57', 358, 1, 22, 617560) But you need not go into these deep waters just now.
('57', 358, 1, 23, 617613) At present you should try to cultivate non attachment without attachment even to that aim.
('57', 358, 1, 24, 617704) That is, you should do with a light and happy heart any service for which you get an opportunity and read and study at the same time whatever you can manage.
('57', 358, 1, 25, 617862) You need not worry either for Nimu or for the children.
('57', 358, 1, 26, 617918) You will now see, with the new eyes which “Ramdas Gita”will give you, that God is there to worry for them and for you.
('57', 358, 1, 27, 618037) You should not only believe this with your reason, but have faith in it and live accordingly.
('57', 358, 1, 28, 618131) You will then be happy and learn everything you wish to.
('57', 358, 1, 29, 618188) Fix firmly in your mind the Lord’s assurance in Chapter IX, that even the most sinful man will have become a good man if he cultivates single minded bhakti for Him.
('57', 358, 1, 30, 618353) The entire world might perish, but anassurance by the Lord never proves false.
('57', 358, 1, 31, 618432) I think I have written enough.

('57', 360, 6, 15, 620652) 607. INTERVIEW TO THE PRESS 1
('57', 360, 7, 16, 620682) November 7, 1932
('57', 360, 8, 17, 620699) In a special interview given to the Associated Press inside the Yeravda Jail Mr. Gandhi emphasized that South India has become the storm centre and explained the reasons why the Guruvayur question was worth the price he had expressed his determination to pay.
('57', 360, 9, 18, 620959) Replying to preliminary enquires he said, for the present his campaign would be confined to the issue of a statement but he was in correspondence with the Birla Committee and would meet them at the end of the month when other plans would be decided.
('57', 360, 10, 19, 621209) Asked about Dr. Ambedkar’s declaration that the temple entry was not worth risking his life, Mr. Gandhi said : I do not take the same light view that Dr. Ambedkar does of the temple entry question.
('57', 360, 10, 20, 621407) In my opinion it is a deciding test as to whether the orthodox Hindu mind has responded to the call of time or not and whether it is prepared to purge Hinduism of the blackmark of untouchability.
('57', 360, 10, 21, 621603) Nothing in my opinion will strike the imagination of the Hindu mass mind including Harijans as throwing open all public
('57', 360, 11, 22, 621723) 1 The interview took place in the Superintendent’s office.
('57', 360, 11, 23, 621782) Also present in the room were Mahadev Desai, Pyarelal and P. Kodandarao of the Servants of India Society.
('57', 361, 0, 1, 621888) 362 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 361, 1, 2, 621930) temples to them precisely on the same terms as caste Hindus.
('57', 361, 1, 3, 621991) I can understand Dr. Ambedkar’s comparative indifference, but I am not thinking of a few cultured men belonging to the depressed classes, but I am thinking of the uncultured, dumb many.
('57', 361, 1, 4, 622177) After all Hindu temples play a most important part in the life of the masses and I who have been trying all my life to identify myself with the most illiterate and downtrodden cannot be satisfied until all temples are open to outcastes of Hindu humanity.
('57', 361, 1, 5, 622432) This, however, does not mean that I belittle in any shape or form other disabilities under which they are labouring.
('57', 361, 1, 6, 622549) I feel about them just as keenly as Dr. Ambedkar.
('57', 361, 1, 7, 622599) Only I feel the evil is so deep rooted that one must not make the choice between different disabilities, but must tackle them all at once.
('57', 361, 1, 8, 622738) That is the burden of my corresp ondence with the Anti untouchability League also.
('57', 361, 1, 9, 622821) The Guruvayur temple has come in my way by accident and I have no option left to me.
('57', 361, 1, 10, 622906) After all, Mr. Kelappan is in my opinion one of the noblest of India’s silent servants.
('57', 361, 1, 11, 622994) A distinguished public career was open to him any day.
('57', 361, 1, 12, 623049) He is a well known worker of Malabar but he deliberately threw in his lot with unapproachables and invisibles.
('57', 361, 1, 13, 623160) I had the pleasure and honour of working with him at the time of the Vykom Satyagraha 1. Long before that time and ever since he has been devoting himself to the uplift of suppressed humanity.
('57', 361, 1, 14, 623353) As the public know, after long waiting he made a fixed determination to give up his life in an attempt to have the Guruvayur temple opened to Harijans.
('57', 361, 1, 15, 623505) I discovered, however, a flaw in his fast and I immediately pointed it out to him and although he believed that victory was within sight, he nobly responded and let it slip from his hands; he retraced his steps and suspended his fast.
('57', 361, 1, 16, 623740) When I telegraphed to him 2 I bound myself to fast with him if resumption became necessary on the termination of three months’ notice he gave.
('57', 361, 1, 17, 623883) I should be an unworthy servant of India and an unworthy comrade if I now flinched and abandoned Kelappan to his fate, but there is something more than the life of a comrade or my own personal honour.
('57', 361, 1, 18, 624084) Everyone recognizes that the depressed classes question has to be solved now or never, not at any rate within the present generation or several generations to come.
('57', 361, 1, 19, 624249) There are thousands of men and women like me who cling to
('57', 361, 2, 20, 624307) 1 This took place in March April 1925 and was aimed at having certain roads thrown open to untouchables from which they had been barred.

('57', 362, 0, 1, 624489) VOL. 57 : 5 SEPTEMBER, 1932 15 NOVEMBER, 1932 363
('57', 362, 1, 2, 624539) Hinduism, because they believe that there is in it the amplest scope for mental, moral and spiritual expansion.
('57', 362, 1, 3, 624651) This bar sinister put upon nearly sixty million human beings is a standing demonstration against that claim.
('57', 362, 1, 4, 624760) Men like me feel that untouchability is no integral part of Hinduism.
('57', 362, 1, 5, 624830) It is an excrescence, but if it is found to be otherwise, and if the Hindu mass mind really hugs untouchability, reformers like me have no other option but to sacrifice ourselves on the altar of our convictions.
('57', 362, 1, 6, 625042) I have patiently and silently listened to the taunt that such a fast is tantamount to suicide and I don’t believe it to be such.
('57', 362, 1, 7, 625171) On the contrary for men with deep religious convictions there is no other outlet for the soul than this final sacrifice when every other effort seems perfectly hopeless.
('57', 362, 1, 8, 625341) This campaign therefore in my opinion is an acid test of what I have claimed for Hinduism and I can only repeat what I said at the Round Table Conference that Hinduism dies if untouchability lives and untouchability has to die if Hinduism is to live and today I make bold to say that there are hundreds if not thousands of Indian men and women who would lay down their lives even as Kelappan and I propose to do to vindicate the claim for Hinduism that it is not a narrow creed or dogma, but a living faith, designed to satisfy the most exacting conscience of the deepest thinker and the godliest person.

('57', 362, 4, 12, 626025) DEAR MAJOR BHANDARI, During the fast week there were two telegrams received from Egypt, one from Madam Zaghloul and the other from Nahas Pasha.
('57', 362, 4, 13, 626169) I cabled suitable replies to both.
('57', 362, 4, 14, 626204) 1 During that week all the important telegrams and my replies to them were handed to the Press.
('57', 362, 4, 15, 626300) But just at present I observe that garbled versions of the telegrams mentioned above in a somewhat ludicrous form are going the round of the Press as if they were the true versions.
('57', 362, 4, 16, 626482) They appear to be translations from Egyptian vernacular newspapers.
('57', 362, 4, 17, 626550) I should like to supply the Press with true copies.

('57', 363, 1, 3, 626798) Of course they have reference to untouchability.

('57', 363, 6, 12, 627484) Now that I am permitted to do propaganda work regarding untouchability, I shall want these and other publications in order to enable me to keep myself in touch with public opinion as expressed in the Press and to combat, where necessary, criticism that may appear therein.
('57', 363, 6, 13, 627757) You seem to doubt whether these papers and magazines that are already coming and which may come in answer to my appeal may under the recent decision of the Government of India be given to me.

('57', 364, 6, 9, 628686) There is not much time to lose.
('57', 364, 6, 10, 628718) I do not know how far your health will let you organize the battle on behalf of the reformers.
('57', 364, 6, 11, 628813) To the extent it is possible I would like you to put your great Sanskrit learning at the disposal of the cause.
('57', 364, 6, 12, 628925) I am sure you have been thinking of the thing yourself.
('57', 364, 6, 13, 628981) But I could not restrain myself from sending you a line when I am writing to many friends about the impending storm.
('57', 364, 7, 14, 629098) It gives me great joy that I am able to take some work out of the Servants 3 here.

('57', 365, 2, 3, 629757) November 8, 1932
('57', 365, 3, 4, 629774) JAMNALAL, Your letter was delivered to me just now.
('57', 365, 3, 5, 629826) It was immediately read out to me and I am now dictating this reply.
('57', 365, 3, 6, 629895) May you have, on your birthday, all the blessings you desire, basketfuls of them.
('57', 365, 3, 7, 629977) Why should we fear death, which comes to all sooner or later—to the great and the humble, to the white and the black, to human beings and other creatures?
('57', 365, 3, 8, 630132) Why grieve over it either?
('57', 365, 3, 9, 630159) I often feel that death must be a less painful event than birth.
('57', 365, 3, 10, 630224) I leave aside the pain which the baby suffers in the mother’s womb before birth.
('57', 365, 3, 11, 630305) But all of us know the suffering in this world which commences from the moment of birth.
('57', 365, 3, 12, 630394) Consider the helplessness of the baby at the moment of birth—every baby as helpless as any other.
('57', 365, 3, 13, 630492) On the other hand, if our life has been pure we shall have no such experience at the moment of death.
('57', 365, 3, 14, 630594) A baby does not seek knowledge, nor can it have any.
('57', 365, 3, 15, 630647) At the time of death, on the other hand, it is not only possible for one to be in a state of union with the Brahman but we actually know that many persons die in such a state.
('57', 365, 3, 16, 630823) Birth always means entering a world of suffering, whereas death can be complete deliverance from suffering.
('57', 365, 3, 17, 630931) We can thus think from many points of view about the beauty and the benefits of death, and can also meet our death in that spirit.
('57', 365, 3, 18, 631062) I bless you that your death may be of this type.
('57', 365, 3, 19, 631111) This wish includes everything else which is for your good.
('57', 365, 3, 20, 631170) The two friends join me in wishing this.
('57', 365, 3, 21, 631211) Even after knowing all the facts about your health, I adhere to the view which I have expressed.
('57', 365, 3, 22, 631308) If you are permitted to obtain your food at your own expense, I see nothing wrong in your doing so.
('57', 365, 3, 23, 631408) We should regard our body as a trust, and it is our duty as its trustee to take care of it to the best of our ability.
('57', 365, 3, 24, 631527) You should not ask for or accept even a grain of jaggery to gratify your palate, but I see nothing wrong in your trying and getting even the costliest variety of grapes if you need them as medicine and if they can be had.
('57', 365, 3, 25, 631749) You need not, therefore, feel unhappy if you have to eat such food.
('57', 365, 3, 26, 631817) If we can, we should also help others who may be placed in similar circumstances to secure such food.
('57', 365, 3, 27, 631919) In my view you don’t require all the wheat that is supplied to you.
('57', 365, 3, 28, 631987) I also think it desirable for you to banish jaggery altogether from your food.
('57', 365, 3, 29, 632066) Your body does not require it at all.
('57', 365, 3, 30, 632104) It is better to take innocent honey instead.
('57', 365, 3, 31, 632149) Mixing any form of sugar in milk affects its digestibility.
('57', 365, 3, 32, 632209) It would be better to increase the quantity of milk instead.
('57', 365, 3, 33, 632270) You are doing right in eating butter and not olive oil.
('57', 365, 3, 34, 632326) The olive oil available in India is not always pure, and of course it cannot be fresh.
('57', 365, 3, 35, 632413) Moreover, olive oil does not contain the vitamins

('57', 366, 1, 2, 632513) which butter does.
('57', 366, 1, 3, 632532) The vegetables which you eat should always be green vegetables.
('57', 366, 1, 4, 632596) Potatoes and similar vegetables are practically a substitute for rotli.
('57', 366, 1, 5, 632668) They contain starch.
('57', 366, 1, 6, 632689) You require very little starch, and whatever little you require you will get from wheat.
('57', 366, 1, 7, 632778) You should not eat pulses in any circumstances.
('57', 366, 1, 8, 632826) If you eat a sufficient quantity of butter, two pounds of milk will be enough for you.
('57', 366, 1, 9, 632913) Whether you should increase or diminish their quantity will depend upon your weight at the time.
('57', 366, 1, 10, 633010) You should go on increasing the quantity of either or both to as much as you can digest, till your weight becomes steady.
('57', 366, 1, 11, 633132) Among the green vegetables, gourd, pumpkin, the different kinds of edible leaves, cabbage, cauliflower, tender bean pods and brinjal are considered good.
('57', 366, 1, 12, 633286) The wheat flour should be whole.
('57', 366, 1, 13, 633319) If the wheat has been properly cleaned before it is ground, no portion of the flour should be thrown away.
('57', 366, 1, 14, 633426) Among fruits, grapes, mosambis, oranges, pomegranates, apples and pineapple are beneficial for health.
('57', 366, 1, 15, 633529) Some experiments being made in America indicate that a meal should not consist of a variety of articles.
('57', 366, 1, 16, 633634) Fruit has the most nourishing value if it is eaten alone, and the best practice is to eat it when the stomach is empty.
('57', 366, 1, 17, 633754) There is even a saying in English to the effect that fruit in the morning is gold and in the afternoon silver.
('57', 366, 1, 18, 633865) Our first meal, therefore, should consist only of fruit, though there would be no harm if it is preceded by a glass of warm water the first thing in the morning.
('57', 366, 1, 19, 634027) If you can get permission to live all the twenty four hours of the day in open air, it would be worth while to secure it.
('57', 366, 1, 20, 634149) It would help you if you can slowly do breathing exercises in open air.
('57', 366, 1, 21, 634221) You need not at all be afraid of the cold at night.
('57', 366, 1, 22, 634273) It will have no harmful effect on your health if you have properly covered yourself up to the neck and wound a piece of cloth over the head so as to keep the ears covered.
('57', 366, 1, 23, 634445) It is essential that the lungs should be supplied with the purest air the whole day and night.
('57', 366, 1, 24, 634540) You should expose your body to the sun in the morning for as long as you can bear.
('57', 366, 1, 25, 634623) Discuss all these suggestions with Dr. Contractor and then do what seems best to you.
('57', 366, 1, 26, 634709) I hope Madhavji is happy and comfortable in every way.
('57', 366, 1, 27, 634764) Give my blessings and regards of all three of us to the co workers who are with you in the jail.
('57', 366, 1, 28, 634861) Probably you know what is going on here in regard to untouchability.
('57', 366, 1, 29, 634930) You can send any suggestions which occur to you.
('57', 366, 1, 30, 634979) You will be permitted by the authorities there to do so.

('57', 367, 3, 8, 635521) Is it not possible to meet the thieves themselves?

('57', 368, 1, 3, 636609) For this reason I have chosen for myself the most universal doctrine of Hinduism, namely, that any conduct that is contrary to truth and ahimsa is to be eschewed and any book that violates these principles is not a Shastra.

('57', 368, 4, 7, 636915) November 9, 1932 A correspondent writes as follows : 1
('57', 368, 5, 8, 636970) I consider your last fast to have been coercion of the worst type.
('57', 368, 5, 9, 637037) I do not want to conceal from you my feeling about Yeravda Pact.
('57', 368, 5, 10, 637102) I know my view is shared by public men who, because of their respect for your personality and because of your detention in the Yeravda Prison, did not like to say anything in public against your action in bringing about the Pact.
('57', 368, 5, 11, 637332) I consider the Pact to be a public misfortune which would never have been brought about but for your unfortunate fast.
('57', 368, 5, 12, 637451) I know of a very esteemed friend of yours who said that if the refusal had not meant your certain death he would never have given his consent to the Pact.
('57', 368, 5, 13, 637606) There is a large number of thinking Hindus who regret having had to accept the Pact, as they think that there would have been no necessity for it if you had only accepted in London what you have done now.
('57', 368, 6, 14, 637811) In a statement you have said, “It was against these millions that my fast wass undertaken.” I take it that was your intention but in actual result it was not these millions but others who had no course left open but to suspend their judgment and feeling in the matter and agree to terms to which nothing in the world would have made them agree, if their refusal had not meant losing your valued life.
('57', 368, 6, 15, 638212) It was their spontaneous love that brought about the transformation inside of five days and brought into being the Yeravda Pact.
('57', 368, 6, 16, 638341) If this is a correct statement of facts, will it not be more correct to say that it was only the fear of your death by starvation which brought about the Pact?
('57', 368, 6, 17, 638501) Remembering the circumstances under which it was brought about I think you will recognize that much need not be made of it; if the Pact is not carried out in its fullness, much less would there be any justification for you to embark on a second fast.
('57', 368, 7, 18, 638752) It gives me no pleasure to have to criticize a public man of your eminence, but the occasion is such that to keep quiet will not be quite honest.
('57', 368, 8, 19, 638898) 1 The correspondent was Radhakant Malaviya; vide p.
('57', 368, 8, 20, 638950) 380, and “Letter to C. Y. Chintamani”, 11 11 1932.
('57', 369, 0, 1, 639001) 370 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 369, 1, 2, 639043) Your assumption that the masses whom you have addressed on the question of untouchability have accepted your views on that question, simply because they did not publicly oppose your views, is not correct.
('57', 369, 1, 3, 639248) Because of their respect for your great personality and because of your political leadership they would hear in silence and, however much they may be opposed to your views, as I know many of them are, at least in Northern India, they would still consider it their duty to give you a respectful hearing.
('57', 369, 1, 4, 639551) As you are aware, these people are not very vocal and they do not go out of their way to oppose the views of those who differ from them, and specially if the views are expressed by one of your eminence.
('57', 369, 1, 5, 639754) I have removed from the letter unnecessary paragraphs and names of public men referred to by the correspondent.
('57', 369, 1, 6, 639866) It would be a matter of great grief to me if public men the correspondent mentions really suppressed their own opinions and accepted proposals which but for the threat of my death they would never have endorsed.
('57', 369, 1, 7, 640078) If they acted as the correspondent suggests, they rendered a great disservice to the country and failed to appreciate the purely religious character of the fast.
('57', 369, 1, 8, 640240) In public life one has often to perform the painful duty of sacrificing friends for the sake of truth or public weal.
('57', 369, 1, 9, 640358) And what was there in the Pact that these friends considered it to be highly objectionable?
('57', 369, 1, 10, 640450) Surely not reservation of seats; not joint electorate, nor the method of nomination of candidates by primary election, as it has been called.
('57', 369, 1, 11, 640592) They could not object to the resolution restoring to Harijans social and religious rights, of which they have cruelly remained dispossessed for ages.
('57', 369, 1, 12, 640742) The only thing remaining is the number of seats allotted to them, but more than that was given to them by the Rajah Moonje Pact, and as I have already said in a previous statement, caste Hindus could never give Harijans too many seats, if they really believed them to be their own kith and kin, whom they had hitherto kept under their heels.
('57', 369, 1, 13, 641084) Sorry indeed is the outlook for them if what the Pact has given them is regarded as an undeserved concession wrung from reluctant caste Hindus by my fast.
('57', 369, 1, 14, 641239) Therefore, if the information given by my correspondent turns but to be true, I would hold my fast to be doubly justified.
('57', 369, 1, 15, 641362) I should not care to live as a member of a society which is chary even of doing a small and tardy measure of justice to its outcastes, who are so through no fault of their own, and my fast was trebly justified if the further statement made by my correspondent is true that millions of whom I have been writing as a matter of fact never endorsed my
('57', 370, 0, 1, 641710) VOL. 57 : 5 SEPTEMBER, 1932 15 NOVEMBER, 1932 371
('57', 370, 1, 2, 641760) vehement condemnation of untouchability and that they remained silent or even signified approval purely out of their respect for my “great personality” or my “political leadership”.
('57', 370, 1, 3, 641942) Life in the midst of such falsity would be a burden to me.
('57', 370, 1, 4, 642001) The sooner public men and people realize the necessity of resisting and asserting themselves even against so called Mahatmas like myself, the better it would be for themselves, the country and for men like me.
('57', 370, 1, 5, 642211) I should gladly fast even to have such a cleansing of the atmosphere.
('57', 370, 1, 6, 642281) My correspondent’s is a timely contribution to the movement.
('57', 370, 1, 7, 642342) Those who are in it should know the implications both of the movement and the prospective fast.
('57', 370, 1, 8, 642438) I can only repeat with all the emphasis at my command that my fast is not intended to coerce anyone to act against what he may consider to be the best interests of society or country.
('57', 370, 1, 9, 642622) My fast is not against persons whom I can name or number.
('57', 370, 1, 10, 642680) It is intended imperceptibly and unconsciously to affect and agitate the millions whom I have in mind and between whom and me, I believe, an indissoluble bond exists.
('57', 370, 1, 11, 642847) How such fasts work I do know from personal experience gained more than once.
('57', 370, 1, 12, 642925) My correspondent suggests that “there would have been no necessity for the Pact if I had only accepted in London what I have done now”.
('57', 370, 1, 13, 643061) I must not rake up the past beyond saying that I could not have done in London what it was possible to do in India.
('57', 370, 1, 14, 643177) The correspondent although he was in London at the time simply does not know all the facts that are in my possession.
('57', 370, 1, 15, 643295) Let not the public, however, run away with the idea that I have many letters protesting against the Pact.
('57', 370, 1, 16, 643401) So far as I can remember, this is the only letter of its kind.
('57', 370, 1, 17, 643464) There are two or three letters complaining of coercion but none suggesting that, therefore, anything was given to Harijans that was not their due, and against this one letter I have hundreds of letters and telegrams warmly approving of the fast itself and the Pact.
('57', 370, 1, 18, 643730) My closest associates both here and in the West with one or two exceptions have endorsed it and themselves felt its spiritual effect.
('57', 370, 1, 19, 643864) But according to my wont and in order to keep the cause I espouse free from any harm, I publish letters containing hostile criticism, especially when it comes from men whom I know to be guided by friendly motives, as my correpondent undoubtedly is.
('57', 370, 1, 20, 644113) As I was handing in this statement, I received a wire from the ever vigilant secretary of the All India Anti Untouchability League, pointing out that the total population of untouchables in India is not
('57', 371, 0, 1, 644316) 372 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

('57', 371, 18, 26, 645351) It is due to my ability to take more milk.
('57', 371, 18, 27, 645394) I turn a portion into what may be called cheese and take it with bread.
('57', 371, 18, 28, 645466) How long I shall be able to do justice to it I do not know.
('57', 371, 18, 29, 645526) You should get rid of your constipation at once.
('57', 371, 18, 30, 645575) And for this fruit should be taken on an empty stomach.
('57', 371, 18, 31, 645631) No other food should be taken for two hours thereafter.

('57', 372, 1, 2, 645929) constipated is to avoid protein foods, i.e., bread and also milk, and take green vegetables cooked alternately with fruit.
('57', 372, 1, 3, 646052) That was how I built up my body after the fast.
('57', 372, 1, 4, 646100) And latterly Vallabhbhai has been correcting his constipation, heaviness and cough by such non nutritious fat free and starch free food.
('57', 372, 1, 5, 646237) It sustains one’s weight fairly well.
('57', 372, 1, 6, 646275) Dried fruit may be taken of course.
('57', 372, 1, 7, 646311) It may be wise not to mix dried fruit with fresh.
('57', 372, 1, 8, 646361) Thus one may take four meals, one consisting of say pomegranate and musambis, the other of vegetables, e.g., dudhi and tomatoes, third of dried figs or dates or prunes soaked in water over night and warmed or cold, the fourth may consist of the same vegetable or pumpkin and lemons squeezed on it or tomatoes repeated or it may consist of salad made of lettuce and tomatoes or grated carrots.
('57', 372, 1, 9, 646754) Such food repeated for a few days should remove obstinate constipation.
('57', 372, 1, 10, 646826) Sometimes mere omission of bread or milk may answer.
('57', 372, 1, 11, 646879) I take it that your bread is real wholemeal bread and when it is chapati it is made of unsifted whole wheat flour.
('57', 372, 1, 12, 646994) The wheat has to be thoroughly cleaned before it is ground.
('57', 372, 1, 13, 647054) The whole of the bran is absolutely necessary if one is to get the fullest advantage from wheat.

('57', 372, 1, 15, 647250) Yes, I am devoting practically the whole of my time to untouchability work.
('57', 372, 1, 16, 647326) The elbows continue to give pain when used in a particular way.
('57', 372, 1, 17, 647390) Most of my letters I now dictate.
('57', 372, 1, 18, 647424) For the few I write I use the hands alternately.
('57', 372, 1, 19, 647473) This seems to answer the purpose.
('57', 372, 1, 20, 647507) I have cut down the spinning just now to 100 rounds from 200. Of course there is not the slightest cause for anxiety over this pain in the elbows.
('57', 372, 1, 21, 647654) They need rest and nothing else.
('57', 372, 1, 22, 647687) With returning strength and the filling in of muscle, probably the pain will disappear.

('57', 373, 1, 2, 648162) 619. LETTER TO MOTILAL ROY
('57', 373, 2, 3, 648189) November 9, 1932
('57', 373, 3, 4, 648206) DEAR MOTIBABU, Just now I must dictate my letters.
('57', 373, 3, 5, 648257) Your book has been received.
('57', 373, 3, 6, 648286) Mahadev knows Bengali quite well.
('57', 373, 3, 7, 648320) The book was received today.
('57', 373, 3, 8, 648349) He has already commenced reading it and fallen in love with it.
('57', 373, 3, 9, 648413) He will read to me extracts from it as soon as possible.
('57', 373, 3, 10, 648470) Your question about varnashrama you will find somewhat answered in one of the statements issued to the Press.
('57', 373, 3, 11, 648580) In my letter to Sureshbabu I never said that varnashrama was in any shape or form an evil, but I did say that caste was a social evil and had to go some day or other.
('57', 373, 3, 12, 648747) I draw a sharp distinction between varna and caste.
('57', 373, 3, 13, 648799) All I have written before on this subject I hold by with perhaps this exception: I have vaguely expressed in my previous writings what I have come to see now clearly, namely, that the four varnas are no longer in actual working order, even as the four Ashrams are not.
('57', 373, 3, 14, 649068) Hence at the present moment there is only one varna in existence.
('57', 373, 3, 15, 649134) We are all Shudras and if we can bring ourselves to believe this, the merger of the Harijans in Savarana Hindus becomes incredibly simple and in course of time, we might be able to reconstruct the old varnas.
('57', 373, 3, 16, 649343) I also seem to see more clearly than before that the law our ancestors discovered was not that the varnas were four and were always to remain four, but that everyone had to follow his own varna which is most nearly expressed by the word profession in English.
('57', 373, 3, 17, 649603) It was no part of varnadharma to regulate dining or marrying, varna determined the profession.
('57', 373, 3, 18, 649698) Custom naturally grew up of people of the same varna restricting marriage to that varna.
('57', 373, 3, 19, 649787) Restriction on inter dining was of a much later growth, but marrying outside one’s varna did not entail forfeiture of the varna.
('57', 373, 3, 20, 649916) I hope to develop my idea of varnadharma in the statements I am issuing, but I think I have said sufficient in my letter to enable you to understand my position.
('57', 373, 3, 21, 650078) Love to you all of the Sangha.

('57', 374, 3, 4, 650258) BHAI SHRI VALJI, I got your note written on a slip of paper.
('57', 374, 3, 5, 650319) Vallabhbhai went through every page of your booklet carefully and said to me: “What came upon Valji?
('57', 374, 3, 6, 650420) Can anyone who cares write this kind of thing?
('57', 374, 3, 7, 650467) Only a Christian can.
('57', 374, 3, 8, 650489) If Valji wants to write, he should write something new which our people can understand.” Mahadev has not offered much criticism as he has not gone further than reading the chapter headings, but he will read the book now.
('57', 374, 3, 9, 650710) I will let you know his opinion after he has read it.
('57', 374, 3, 10, 650764) Personally, I do not think any book should be given free.
('57', 374, 3, 11, 650822) If, however, a person who requires a particular book cannot afford to buy it, you may supply a copy to him from your stock.
('57', 374, 5, 12, 650946) MANU, This time your handwriting was better.

('57', 374, 10, 19, 651292) I had heard about the illness there, and hence I was all the more eager to hear from you.
('57', 374, 10, 20, 651382) I do get reports from Ahmednagar.
('57', 374, 10, 21, 651416) All the prisoners are now out of danger.
('57', 374, 10, 22, 651457) They are being looked after well enough.
('57', 374, 10, 23, 651498) Gangabehn and others even visited them.

('57', 376, 8, 12, 653551) Rewritten November 10, 1932
('57', 376, 9, 13, 653579) DEAR FRIEND, Though you have absolved me from having to write to you in reply to your letter, I must not avail myself of your kindness.
('57', 376, 9, 14, 653715) You have evidently ascribed to the workers against untouchability much more than they have themselves claimed.
('57', 376, 9, 15, 653826) No one has ever thought of destroying varnashrama dharma.
('57', 376, 9, 16, 653884) And you are wholly wrong in thinking that the movement is carried on by or is confined to the English speaking people.
('57', 376, 9, 17, 654003) It is a mass movement in which even utterly illiterate men and women are taking part with religious zeal, and are you sure that varnadharma and Ashrama dharma are being observed to any appreciable degree by even those who regard themselves as orthodox?
('57', 376, 9, 18, 654256) Again I do not know what you wish to convey by the expression “levelling”, and you write of forcible levelling.
('57', 376, 9, 19, 654368) I do not know that anybody has used force to level down anybody else, whatever the latter expression may mean.
('57', 376, 9, 20, 654479) And you are surely libelling the untouchables when you ascribe to them vices from which the touchables, you evidently claim, are free.
('57', 376, 9, 21, 654614) Not all the untouchables trade in toddy or liquor dealing, and what is worse drinking or selling intoxicating liquors?
('57', 376, 9, 22, 654733) Have you any personal experience of the private

('57', 377, 1, 2, 654952) life of untouchables?
('57', 377, 1, 3, 654974) Do you consider them to be guilty of the hideous immorality of the lives of many touchables who disgrace themselves and Hinduism?
('57', 377, 1, 4, 655104) And who is responsible for whatever is bad about untouchables?
('57', 377, 1, 5, 655167) I refrain from saying more.
('57', 377, 1, 6, 655195) From your letter head I see that you are yourself a distinguished product of English learning and have obtained an upadhi for your knowledge of San khya and Vedanta.
('57', 377, 1, 7, 655361) I have never seen anything in either Sankhya or Vedanta that teaches a man to hold in contempt his fellow beings as you seem to do in almost every line of your letter.
('57', 377, 1, 8, 655529) And my grief is enhanced by my strong suspicion that you have never cared to study the lives of those unfortunate fellow Hindus whom you and I and other Hindus who have arrogated superiority for themselves have ground down to dust.
('57', 377, 1, 9, 655761) I invite you to read the signs of the times and join me in thinking that purification of Hinduism will not come through arrogance and slander of innocent people.

('57', 377, 6, 14, 656049) DEAR FRIEND, Your letter of 23rd ultimo was received in due course, but for reasons you now know I was unable to reply earlier.
('57', 377, 6, 15, 656177) Students, if they will work heartily and intelligently, can do much in spite of the orthodox opposition.
('57', 377, 6, 16, 656282) They can go to the quarters of the untouchables, fraternize with them on equal terms, understand their difficulties and remove all those in their power to remove, bring them medical help, teach them the laws of cleanliness, conduct night and day schools for them, invite them to their games and take their children for outings.
('57', 377, 6, 17, 656610) Those difficulties which they cannot remove, they can bring to the notice of the local branch of the newly established League or write to the central body, make a thoroughly critical and scholarly study of their conditions and publish it in pamphlet form.
('57', 377, 6, 18, 656866) This is the most

('57', 378, 3, 7, 657418) November 10, 1932 From what I can see and feel, the battle at Guruvayur is to attain all India importance and orthodoxy is to concentrate all its fire upon the temple.
('57', 378, 3, 8, 657586) I should welcome it.
('57', 378, 3, 9, 657607) It should result in much greater purification than I had expected.
('57', 378, 3, 10, 657674) But that means that all that is best in Hinduism has to consolidate itself and resist the orthodox onrush.
('57', 378, 3, 11, 657781) I am anxious therefore for you, if it is possible for you and if you feel with me, to throw yourself heart and soul into the movement.
('57', 378, 3, 12, 657916) But I observed from your writings on the last fast that you were opposed to such fasting.
('57', 378, 3, 13, 658006) I hold very strong views about it and feel that it is not only a legitimate weapon, but that for one who will not resort to violence in any shape or form it becomes obligatory under given circumstances.
('57', 378, 3, 14, 658209) And now that I am free to receive visitors in connection with this movement I would like you to see me any time next week, at, say, 1 o’clock, so that we can discuss the ethics of penitential public fasts and see whether we cannot agree.
('57', 378, 3, 15, 658447) You know me enough to feel sure that if in the course of our discussion I discover my own error I shall have no hesitation in retracing my step.

('57', 379, 3, 4, 658754) DEAR GURUDEV, You must have seen the statement I have circulated to the Press.1 I want your blessings, if I can have them, for this further effort.
('57', 379, 3, 5, 658902) I do not know whether you feel that this effort is, if possible, purer than before.
('57', 379, 3, 6, 658986) The last fast had a political tinge about it and superficial critics were able to say that it was aimed at the British Government.
('57', 379, 3, 7, 659117) This time if the ordeal has to come, it will not be possible to give any political colour to it.
('57', 379, 3, 8, 659214) You will of course recall that the last fast was broken on the clearest possible notice that I might have to resume it if there was any breach of faith by the so called caste Hindus.
('57', 379, 3, 9, 659397) The prospective fast about Guruvayur temple is absolutely a point of honour.
('57', 379, 3, 10, 659474) It is being made by the orthodox section the centre of attack and is being given an all India significance.
('57', 379, 3, 11, 659582) I rather like it.
('57', 379, 3, 12, 659600) But it makes it all the more necessary for the liberalizing influences to be collected together and set in motion in order to overthrow the monster of untouchability.
('57', 379, 3, 13, 659767) I want your whole hearted co opeartion if you feel as I do.

('57', 379, 7, 19, 659990) November 10, 1932 I agree with most of your views about untouchability, but the reasons which you have given for refusing to join the Committee have not convinced me.
('57', 379, 7, 20, 660157) I do believe that Hindus who are known to be orthodox should join such a committee.
('57', 379, 7, 21, 660241) If, however, as a result of waiting for such Hindus to join, the very work for which the Committee has been formed is held up, we should do without them, and, irrespective of whether or not the Committee includes such

('57', 380, 1, 4, 660926) And now about the point on which we differ.
('57', 380, 1, 5, 660970) Though I admit the usefulness and necessity of meetings, processions, speeches, conferences, etc., I believe that without constructive work we shall not succeed in eradicating untouchability completely nor will large num bers of Harijans learn to hate it.
('57', 380, 1, 6, 661226) It is certainly true that such work will require an army of voluntary workers, both men and women, and much money.
('57', 380, 1, 7, 661341) If, however, you recognize the imperative necessity of the work, you should not refuse to attempt it merely out of fear that we might not get the needed money and such a large number of workers.
('57', 380, 1, 8, 661536) I think that, in a great movement like this, we cannot ignore a single aspect of the task.

('57', 380, 6, 14, 661771) The right method to follow for writing letters or doing any other work is to fix the time for every work.
('57', 380, 6, 15, 661877) If you really wish to write every week, then you should fix in your mind a day and an hour when you will write.
('57', 380, 6, 16, 661989) Then the thought will not be a burden on your mind and you will be able to write regularly without any difficulty.
('57', 380, 6, 17, 662104) What is the name of the vaid from Mathura?
('57', 380, 6, 18, 662147) Do you get cow’s milk there?
('57', 380, 6, 19, 662176) Is the ghee made from cow’s or buffalo’s milk?
('57', 380, 7, 20, 662223) BENARSI, I saw your signature.
('57', 380, 7, 21, 662254) Father writes to me every week.
('57', 380, 7, 22, 662286) How is his work prospering?

('57', 381, 3, 5, 662535) It was very good that you stayed with Sir Kurma.
('57', 381, 3, 6, 662584) Sastri is a man of few words.
('57', 381, 3, 7, 662614) Don’t believe what people may say against him.
('57', 381, 3, 8, 662661) You will find with this a letter from Pragji.
('57', 381, 3, 9, 662707) Read it and think over it.
('57', 381, 3, 10, 662734) Do not get angry with him.
('57', 381, 3, 11, 662761) Try to understand his point of view and then write to me.
('57', 381, 3, 12, 662819) I will write to him only after I hear from you.
('57', 381, 3, 13, 662867) You may observe that what he writes is quite the opposite of what you complain.
('57', 381, 3, 14, 662947) If you have promised to return there in December, you must start making preparations.

('57', 381, 8, 21, 663235) My fear has come true.
('57', 381, 8, 22, 663258) Since you write to me regularly, whenever I do not get a letter from you I feel uneasy.
('57', 381, 8, 23, 663346) When you are not well you can ask Father or Mother to write a postcard.
('57', 381, 8, 24, 663418) Whatever may happen, I certainly do not wish that you yourself should write to me when you are ill.
('57', 381, 8, 25, 663518) How did you fall ill?
('57', 381, 8, 26, 663540) Did you overwork?
('57', 381, 8, 27, 663558) You ought not to fall ill.
('57', 381, 8, 28, 663585) I hope you are better now.
('57', 381, 8, 29, 663612) You need not reply to this letter yourself.

('57', 382, 2, 4, 664024) You have to cultivate public opinion in your favour by the gentlest means.
('57', 382, 2, 5, 664099) You should see whether the temple going population is in favour of Harijans being admitted to the temple on the same terms as the other, and you should also remember that temple entry is not the only thing to be done.
('57', 382, 2, 6, 664317) You have to ascertain the condition of untouchables in your neighbourhood in every walk of life, make a scientific study and pass the results of your study on to me, alleviating at the same time such distress among the Harijans as you are capable of doing.

('57', 382, 5, 10, 664780) The names referred to therein were those of your good self and Pandit Hridayanath Kunzru.
('57', 382, 5, 11, 664870) Radhakant, the writer, has now given me permission upon my request to disclose his name to you and Pandit Kunzru.
('57', 382, 5, 12, 664984) Before I say anything, it is due to you that I should know from you whether you actually felt coerced by my fast and acted against your conscience.

('57', 383, 1, 5, 665945) It was only last week that I invited Urmila Devi 1 to go down to the South in answer to a summons from Kerala.
('57', 383, 1, 6, 666056) She at once wired consent.
('57', 383, 1, 7, 666083) Will you do likewise?
('57', 383, 1, 8, 666105) I do not say go down South, but I do want you to promise to take a due share in the uplift work.

('57', 383, 5, 13, 666361) MY DEAR CHILD,
('57', 383, 6, 14, 666376) I have your latest letter telling me how in ecstasy 2 you would have run to the telegraph office to wire to me and how you subse quently realized that that would have been wrong if only because we are poor people and all the money we had, had to be held in trust for God’s service.
('57', 383, 6, 15, 666658) And I had your long love letter which you had sent to the Ashram address.
('57', 383, 6, 16, 666732) Well, the fast was well worth it even for enabling Menon to give up smoking.
('57', 383, 6, 17, 666809) The value lies in having given up a thing which had so possessed him.
('57', 383, 6, 18, 666879) I know that many young men and young women, old men and old women were moved to such restraint and self denial during the fast week.
('57', 383, 6, 19, 667012) It shows that it was from God.
('57', 383, 6, 20, 667043) I saw and we all admired the group photo with Andrews in it.
('57', 383, 6, 21, 667104) It was very good.
('57', 383, 6, 22, 667122) And the bare bodied Tangai.
('57', 383, 6, 23, 667150) She looks a perfect picture.
('57', 383, 6, 24, 667179) I expect in your next letter to see the account of your visit to the diseased sister.
('57', 383, 6, 25, 667265) I had a long letter from the Sunfield School people giving me an account of the new buildings.
('57', 383, 6, 26, 667360) You must not trifle with your body by putting into it things that will not suit it.
('57', 383, 6, 27, 667444) You cannot build your body on pulses.
('57', 383, 6, 28, 667482) You do not need them at all.

('57', 384, 5, 23, 668842) Naturally friends and co workers who believe in the removal of un touchability will be stirred to action.
('57', 384, 5, 24, 668948) That is no matter for regret.
('57', 384, 5, 25, 668978) Nevertheless, if you have a clear call of conscience you will, of course, fast.

('57', 385, 2, 3, 669550) November 11, 1932
('57', 385, 3, 4, 669568) MY DEAR RAJBHOJ, I was very glad to be able to see you and the friends who came with you and I feel thankful that my advice proved acceptable to you.
('57', 385, 3, 5, 669718) I am quite sure that no satyagraha should be attempted regarding temple entry, nor any fast undertaken by anybody, whilst all attention is being concentrated on Guruvayur.
('57', 385, 3, 6, 669890) Nor should anybody think of undertaking sympathetic fast, should it become necessary for Sjt.
('57', 385, 3, 7, 669984) Kelappan and myself to do so.
('57', 385, 3, 8, 670014) My advice however to suspend satya graha whilst all energy is being devoted to Guruvayur temple does not mean that no other effort should be made about opening the other temples.
('57', 385, 3, 9, 670193) That has to be made unremittingly.
('57', 385, 3, 10, 670228) But just now it is a point of honour with caste Hindus to do so.
('57', 385, 3, 11, 670293) It will be time enough for Harijans to think of it when it is clearly established that caste Hindus will do nothing to secure the opening of public temples to Harijans.
('57', 385, 3, 12, 670462) Fortunately every day brings the news of some temple being spontaneously opened somewhere to the Harijans and from all accounts that I have been receiving such effort is being continued though undoubtedly not with the same enthusiasm that marked the fast week.
('57', 385, 3, 13, 670723) What however Harijans may do to facilitate the work of caste Hindus is to take up, so far as it is possible, internal reform such as observance of the laws of cleanliness, and giving up carrion and drink.
('57', 385, 3, 14, 670928) I have discussed such things exhaustively with you.
('57', 385, 3, 15, 670980) The matter of opening facilities for the technical training of Harijan children and offering scholarships to deserving Harijan youths, I propose to discuss with Seth Ghanshyamdas Birla and the other members of the A.I.A.U. League 1 when they come here to see me.

('57', 387, 1, 4, 673072) I had intended to pass these on to the League.

('57', 387, 6, 22, 673992) BHAI VIYOGI HARI, I have your letter, I was so pleased.
('57', 387, 6, 23, 674048) I like Tandonji’s suggestion the best.
('57', 387, 6, 24, 674087) Your feild is literature and service to the cause of Hindi.
('57', 387, 6, 25, 674147) If while doing this you can also do Harijan service, you will have done all.
('57', 387, 6, 26, 674224) I do not see any reason for reviving Patit Bandhu.
('57', 387, 6, 27, 674275) At the present moment our conduct is the best form of propaganda.
('57', 387, 6, 28, 674341) There are so many newspapers; your articles will always find a place in them.
('57', 387, 7, 29, 674419) Yours, MOHANDAS [PS.] You can certainly come if you wish to meet me.

('57', 387, 9, 31, 674529) 1 Quoting Dr. Kellogg’s opinion, the addressee had suggested that Gandhiji should give up soda bicarb as its daily use was harmful to the stomach and caused nausea.

('57', 388, 1, 2, 674744) 643. INTERVIEW TO P. N. RAJBHOJ 1
('57', 388, 2, 3, 674778) November 11, 1932
('57', 388, 3, 4, 674796) RAJBHOJ: The untouchables are trying to enter the temples by all possible means.
('57', 388, 3, 5, 674877) Suppose the methods of persuasion and mutual goodwill fail, do you think that the untouchables should resort to satyagraha?
('57', 388, 3, 6, 675001) If they may resort to it, what should be the method adopted?
('57', 388, 4, 7, 675062) GANDHIJI: Under the present circumstances I don’t think that satyagraha is at all advisable or needed.
('57', 388, 4, 8, 675165) All efforts should be concentrated on Guruvayur.
('57', 388, 4, 9, 675214) Harijans should for the time being watch what the caste men are doing.
('57', 388, 4, 10, 675285) Whatever happens about Guruvayur is likely to happen to many if not all the other temples.
('57', 388, 5, 11, 675376) R: In the case of the entry into the Parvati temple all methods have been tried, including the attempts of Sjts.
('57', 388, 5, 12, 675489) Jamnalal Bajaj and Mr. N. C. Kelkar.
('57', 388, 5, 13, 675526) May I know how to get out of this fix?
('57', 388, 6, 14, 675565) G. I am aware of your efforts and satyagraha in regard to the Parvati temple.
('57', 388, 6, 15, 675643) Even regarding this I should advise you to wait till the Guruvayur matter is settled one way or the other.
('57', 388, 6, 16, 675750) In the meanwhile you can carry on negotiations with the Parvati Trustees and create public opinion.
('57', 388, 7, 17, 675850) R: Now that Government has permitted you to do untouchability work unfettered what objections have you to come out and devote yourself to this cause alone?
('57', 388, 8, 18, 676006) G. I cannot accept my freedom under any restrictions.
('57', 388, 8, 19, 676060) But this is a matter I must not discuss.
('57', 388, 9, 20, 676101) R: We learn from the correspondence published in the papers that you have announced a fast in suit with Mr. Kelappan.
('57', 388, 9, 21, 676219) Suppose any “touchable” or untouchable announces another fast in connection with some other noteworthy temple, say Kashi Vishveshwar, may I know whether you will be prepared to stake your life in every such case?
('57', 388, 9, 22, 676432) Do you think that your person will be able to cope with this anomalous situation?
('57', 388, 10, 23, 676514) G. I have given my word to Mr. Kelappan, and I am in honour bound to start my fast with him on the 2nd of January, 1933. If somebody else starts a similar fast in respect of another temple, I do not hold myself bound to join him.
('57', 388, 10, 24, 676744) Every case has to be examined on
('57', 388, 11, 25, 676777) 1 The text reproduced here is from a report in The Bombay Chronicle which gives both questions and answers.
('57', 388, 11, 26, 676885) Some of the answers are reproduced from a photostat of a typewritten copy containing corrections in Gandhiji’s own hand.

('57', 389, 1, 2, 677048) its merits.
('57', 389, 1, 3, 677060) And in no case should workers resort to fast without full deliberation and justification.
('57', 389, 2, 4, 677150) R: What are the obligations and duties of the “touchables” and untouchables with regard to indiscriminate use by both of public wells or such other common sources of water, tanks, etc.?
('57', 389, 3, 5, 677336) G. The untouchables have as much right to have water from the public wells and tanks as the “touchables”.
('57', 389, 3, 6, 677442) The matter, in case of any difference of opinion should be settled amicably by persuasion and negotiation.
('57', 389, 3, 7, 677549) All the difficulties which cannot be solved locally should be brought to the notice of the All India Anti Untouchability League.
('57', 389, 3, 8, 677678) I will of course do what I can from here.
('57', 389, 3, 9, 677720) Whereas in the matter of the use of public wells, there is a clear legal right, the untouchables can seek the protection of law courts, but this method does not help downtrodden people.
('57', 389, 3, 10, 677906) The strong will always get round or disregard the law.
('57', 389, 3, 11, 677961) The chief thing therefore is by conciliatory attitude to create favourable local public opinion.
('57', 389, 3, 12, 678058) Mr. Birla and Mr. Thakkar are coming to Poona to confer with me about this problem and the methods to be adopted for its solution.
('57', 389, 3, 13, 678189) You should whole heartedly co operate with and help the League.
('57', 389, 4, 14, 678253) R: It is the desire of the depressed classes that the League should give precedence in spending its funds on technical education for the depressed classes, such as tanning, leather goods, rope making, etc., in foreign countries as well as in India instead of spending it on other propaganda.
('57', 389, 4, 15, 678545) So on behalf of these classes I have to request you to press this point of view for the promotion of this idea.
('57', 389, 5, 16, 678657) It is also our desire that common hostels be opened where “touchables” and untouchables will stay together.
('57', 389, 6, 17, 678765) G. I agree to your proposal about spending some of the funds of the League in scholarships for the untouchables and for technical education such as leather tanning, making leather goods, rope making, etc., in India as well as foreign countries.
('57', 389, 6, 18, 679010) I am wholly with you when you suggest the opening of common hostels for the “touchables” and the untouchables and trying to get the existing ones thrown open to the latter.
('57', 389, 6, 19, 679183) The League will surely try and use its influence in this matter.
('57', 389, 7, 20, 679248) R. Don’t you think that the campaign against untouchability should be
('57', 389, 8, 21, 679318) 1 The questions to which the foregoing three paragraphs are answers are not available.
('57', 390, 0, 1, 679405) VOL. 57 : 5 SEPTEMBER, 1932 15 NOVEMBER, 1932 391
('57', 390, 1, 2, 679455) confined to villages, the centres of orthodoxy, rather than to towns where people are educated and broad minded to a little extent at least?
('57', 390, 1, 3, 679596) Are not some women workers necessary to do propaganda work among village women ?
('57', 390, 2, 4, 679677) G. Yes, the campaign against untouchability should primarily be carried on vigorously in the villages.
('57', 390, 2, 5, 679780) In the East Khandesh District and several other Provinces and districts movement of this sort has been already commenced.
('57', 390, 2, 6, 679902) Women should come forward in large numbers to work for this movement.
('57', 390, 2, 7, 679972) This is a very fine question.
('57', 390, 2, 8, 680002) The untouchables should help much.
('57', 390, 2, 9, 680037) They should observe common cleanliness, should refrain from eating the meat of dead animals and from drink, send their children to schools, remove untouchability among themselves and generally carry on such reform from within as is possible.
('57', 390, 3, 10, 680279) R. Do you feel the necessity of incorporating the question of removal of untouchability as one of the Fundamental Rights in the new constitution of India?
('57', 390, 3, 11, 680434) That is to say, will it be proper to consider it a criminal offence if any Hindu is treated as an untouchable at any public place and, further, will it be proper to punish him under a law for wounding his religious susceptibilities?
('57', 390, 3, 12, 680667) If time comes, will the Indian National Congress be prepared and try to embody this principle in the constitution ?
('57', 390, 3, 13, 680783) G. Removal of untouchability should undoubtedly be one of the Fundamental Rights in the new constitution of India.
('57', 390, 3, 14, 680898) It should be considered a criminal offence to treat any Hindu as an untouchable.
('57', 390, 3, 15, 680979) The Congress will certainly be prepared to embody this principle in the constitution.
('57', 390, 3, 16, 681065) They should see that violence is not resorted to in furtherance of their objects.
('57', 390, 3, 17, 681147) I don’t think that the untouchables only are supposed to do the work of sweepers, of carrying carcases, mending shoes, etc.
('57', 390, 3, 18, 681271) Cases of ill treatment because of the so called untouchables refusing to do any work of this sort should be referred to the local agent of the League.
('57', 390, 3, 19, 681422) Nobody should object to inter caste dinners, but no force should be brought to bear upon persons who don’t wish to attend such functions.
('57', 390, 3, 20, 681560) But I am of opinion that it would not be wise to make inter caste dinners an item in your programme.
('57', 390, 3, 21, 681661) I should not advise the untouchables to leave their trades and professions.

('57', 391, 3, 5, 682112) Please come and see me when you get the time.
('57', 391, 3, 6, 682158) For this work, anybody can see me.
('57', 391, 3, 7, 682193) I think you probably saw Urmiladevi, Deshbandhu Das’s sister, during the week of the fast.
('57', 391, 3, 8, 682284) She will be going to the South in a few days for this work.
('57', 391, 3, 9, 682344) But she will come and see me before going.
('57', 391, 3, 10, 682387) She will stay in Poona for a day or two.
('57', 391, 3, 11, 682428) Will you kindly put her up?
('57', 391, 3, 12, 682456) She is likely to come on any day during the next week.
('57', 391, 3, 13, 682511) Kindly inform me by telephone or postcard, or come and see me personally.

('57', 391, 9, 19, 682734) BHAI SATAVLEKAR, What part are you playing in the task of eradication of untouchability?
('57', 391, 9, 20, 682823) In the face of the attacks by self styled sanatanists we need the religious organization of those who wish to purify and ennoble Hinduism.
('57', 391, 9, 21, 682962) I do not mean an organization such as the ones we see coming up these days.
('57', 391, 9, 22, 683038) But the reformers should declare their considered opinion in one voice.
('57', 391, 9, 23, 683110) I feel that no reformer should sit back out of lethargy or hesitation.
('57', 391, 9, 24, 683181) Please do whatever you consider proper in this matter.
('57', 391, 10, 25, 683236) Yours, MOHANDAS

('57', 392, 1, 2, 683351) 646. INTERVIEW TO “THE HINDU ”
('57', 392, 2, 3, 683382) November 12, 1932
('57', 392, 3, 4, 683400) Asked whether he had seen Lord Sankey’s latest appeal in the Newsletter, Gandhiji observed : So far as I can understand Sir Samuel Hoare’s answer in the House of Commons to a question, letters dissuading me from civil disobedience can pass the jail precincts and be delivered to me.
('57', 392, 3, 5, 683683) But I know that I have no authority to send replies to such letters with the assurance that they will leave the precincts of the jail.
('57', 392, 3, 6, 683818) Under the limits that I have accepted or imposed upon myself, so far as these interviews are concerned, I may not give any reply in answer to questions by reporters or even by private friends who may visit me.
('57', 392, 4, 7, 684028) When reminded that Lord Sankey wanted a gesture and asked how he would get a reply, Gandhiji said he would gladly read Lord Sankey’s appeal with all the respect and attention that an appeal from him would demand.
('57', 392, 4, 8, 684241) The Mahatma observed : After having read it if I come to the conclusion that I can make a useful reply, it will be duly submitted to the Government for despatch to Lord Sankey.
('57', 392, 5, 9, 684418) Gandhiji answering my question regarding Guruvayur, told me that the next fast to be declared was dependent upon Mr. Kelappan’s.
('57', 392, 5, 10, 684547) He said : I can conceive of circumstances when I have to take it up independently.
('57', 392, 5, 11, 684630) Supposing Mr. Kelappan dies, God forbid it, I shall have to carry out the fast.
('57', 392, 5, 12, 684710) I have taken an extreme illustration.
('57', 392, 5, 13, 684748) Ordinarily speaking, I do not expect to take it independently of Mr. Kelappan.
('57', 392, 6, 14, 684827) Asked what his attitude would be if Mr. Kelappan felt satisfied that steps were being taken in right earnest, and the temple was bound to be opened shortly, though not exactly on January 1st next, say, one or two weeks later.
('57', 392, 6, 15, 685053) Gandhiji said : Supposing Mr. Kelappan comes to such a conclusion, he will have to reason it out with me and satisfy me that there is no occasion for fasting.
('57', 392, 6, 16, 685212) Let me say I do not expect Mr. Kelappan ever to say that.
('57', 392, 6, 17, 685270) But assume that Mr. Kelappan weakens and wants to wriggle out of the vow taken before God and man; if there is the slightest suspicion of that character, I would require some satisfaction for my reason.
('57', 392, 6, 18, 685473) But I have always believed Mr. Kelappan to be inflexible in his
('57', 392, 7, 19, 685537) 1 For Gandhiji’s reply to Lord Sankey, Vide “Cable to Lord Sankey”, 13 11 1932.
('57', 393, 0, 1, 685617) 394 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 393, 1, 2, 685659) determination and unbending in the good cause.
('57', 393, 2, 3, 685706) Questioned whether he had examined, as was his wont, the Guruvayur temple entry question in all its details before deciding on a fast, Gandhiji replied: I cannot pretend that I have examined the question in all its details.
('57', 393, 2, 4, 685930) I have entirely depended upon Mr. Kelappan having done so though, generally speaking, I have been undoubtedly satisfying myself as to the correctness of the claim for opening the temple to the untouchables.
('57', 393, 2, 5, 686137) But if anyone were to ask me whether I have seen the trust deed, if there is any, of the Guruvayur temple or whether I have critically examined the customs or conditions governing the mana gement of that celebrated temple, I must confess my ignorance.
('57', 393, 3, 6, 686389) When his attention was drawn to the Zamorin’s latest letter published in The Hindu dated 7th November that the Zamorin stood no longer bound by the assurance given to Mr. Kelappan when he commenced his fast, to go into the question if in the meanwhile Mr. Kelappan broke his fast, as Mr. Kelappan had rejected the offer and continued the fast, Gandhiji observed : The Zamorin’s charge against Mr. Kelappan of discourtesy and his refusal on that ground to carry out his assurance appears to be incomprehensible.
('57', 393, 3, 7, 686900) His assurance though given to Mr. Kelappan was quite an assurance to the general public and it amounted to a declaration that he was alive to the duty that rested upon him, of making every endeavour to find a way out.
('57', 393, 3, 8, 687118) As a responsible person, and as a trustee, in my opinion, he is bound, irrespective of Mr. Kelappan’s conduct, to carry out that assurance.
('57', 393, 4, 9, 687258) The trustee of a Hindu temple is not merely to guard the customs or so called privileges of a particular caste, but to guard the purity of Hinduism itself, and to respond to the daily growing spiritual aspirations of the Hindus.
('57', 393, 4, 10, 687487) Such a trustee cannot afford to be ruffled by what one or even many men may say against him.
('57', 393, 4, 11, 687580) And so far as the legal aspect of the question is concerned, I know the Zamorin’s contention, but the legal difficulties are there to be combated and overcome when they stand in the way of a great moral reform.
('57', 393, 4, 12, 687791) Therefore neither the Zamorin nor any other per son can be allowed to plead legal difficulties as a sufficient answer against the opening of the temple.
('57', 393, 4, 13, 687944) If public opinion itself is morally justified, a responsible trustee like the Zamorin is expected to remove the legal obstacles in the way of the moral demand of the public being

('57', 394, 1, 2, 688234) satisfied.
('57', 394, 2, 3, 688245) Q. Would you postpone your fast, if efforts are made to amend the Act to admit
('57', 394, 3, 4, 688324) untouchables into the temple, but the legislature is not able to find time to get the Bill through before 1st January?
('57', 394, 4, 5, 688443) A. Supposing it is physically impossible to secure an amendment of the Act before 1st January, that would be sufficient justification for the postponement of the fast.
('57', 394, 4, 6, 688611) That presupposes that all the steps that could be taken have been taken, and that humanly speaking, there is every chance of the legislation going through.
('57', 394, 4, 7, 688767) That again presupposes that the public, trustees and everybody have to be of one mind.
('57', 394, 5, 8, 688854) Asked whether he would entertain the suggestion to invite a body of orthodox sanatanists to meet him and attempt to reach an amicable settlement of the issue, Mahatmaji said : I would consider it a presumption to invite a body of great people to come to me.
('57', 394, 5, 9, 689112) It is out of respect to them that I say that I won’t invite them.
('57', 394, 5, 10, 689178) I don’t invite these people not because I do not want to see them, nor because I think they can have nothing to say to me.
('57', 394, 5, 11, 689301) I refrain from inviting them out of regard for their status.
('57', 394, 5, 12, 689362) But if I discover that if I only issued an invitation to them they would gladly come, I would have no hesitation in sending such an invitation.
('57', 394, 6, 13, 689506) Asked how he was disposed towards those who sympathized with the temple entry movement, and at the same time wanted to respect the feelings of the orthodox sanatanists that the so called untouchables should be allowed to go into the temples as far as the Dhwajastambham and the deity brought down there on festive days for darshan, the Mahatma said : This movement is to remove untouchability.
('57', 394, 6, 14, 689900) Therefore, the un touchables should enjoy precisely the same rights as the “touch ables”, but that does not mean that they should have access to the sanctuary, which is only open to those who are in charge of the ceremonial.
('57', 394, 6, 15, 690125) If non Brahmins are prevented from going because they are considered untouchables, then undoubtedly that untouchability must go.
('57', 394, 6, 16, 690254) But if there is no black mark of untouchability against them, but it is only the Brahmins who are allowed to go as far as certain parts of the sanctuary, I should have nothing to say against it as a part of this movement.
('57', 394, 6, 17, 690476) The question of the exclusive rights of the Brahmins in connection with religious ceremonies stands on a different footing, and if that exclusiveness has to go, that question will have to be separately examined.
('57', 394, 6, 18, 690688) I am not prepared, off hand, to condemn the practice of reserving certain functions exclusively for a
('57', 395, 0, 1, 690790) 396 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 395, 1, 2, 690832) particular class.
('57', 395, 1, 3, 690850) This won’t be a matter of right, but of duty, to be performed by a body of experts, having the required qualifications.
('57', 395, 2, 4, 690970) Referring to Mr. V. V. Srinivasa Iyengar’s remark that temple entry is being urged as generous gesture of political conciliation, Gandhiji observed : I had the privilege of knowing Mr. V. V. Srinivasa Iyengar even before he became a Judge of the Madras High Court, and it is astonishing to me how temple entry can, by any stretch of imagination, be regarded as a political question.
('57', 395, 2, 5, 691353) I simply cannot understand it.
('57', 395, 3, 6, 691384) Concluding, Gandhiji said : If Hinduism could cure itself of the age long curse without outside intervention the cause of Hinduism would be better served.
('57', 395, 3, 7, 691539) Non Hindus will immediately begin to think that there is something very vital in Hinduism.
('57', 395, 3, 8, 691630) I feel that the removal of untouchability is such a tremendous reform in Hinduism that it must have a reaction throughout the world.
('57', 395, 3, 9, 691763) It will be a total denial of my existence if my method of approach proves a failure.
('57', 395, 4, 10, 691848) At the end of the conversation, I found Gandhiji exhausted.
('57', 395, 4, 11, 691908) When I expressed my doubt as to whether he would be able to successfully undergo another fast, Gandhiji remarked that he was hopeful of it.
('57', 395, 5, 12, 692048) To another remark as to what he would do if the Madras Council rejected the proposed Bill, the Mahatma remarked : I don’t anticipate such a failure.
('57', 395, 5, 13, 692197) A House which adopted Dr. Subbaroyan’s resolution will not reject a Bill amending the present Act if introduced.
('57', 395, 5, 14, 692310) I don’t believe in dying before my days.
('57', 395, 6, 15, 692351) Gandhiji is pleased with the Madras Council’s action in passing Dr. Subbaroyan’s resolution and is watching what steps are taken to give effect to the same.

('57', 396, 1, 2, 692580) 647. LETTER TO CHAMPABEHN R. MEHTA 1
('57', 396, 2, 3, 692617) [Before November 13, 1932] 2
('57', 396, 3, 4, 692646) If you think that being appointed one of the trustees 3 will make you free, you are mistaken.
('57', 396, 3, 5, 692740) The word “trust” means responsibility, and I would certainly welcome a person becoming a trustee of his own property.
('57', 396, 3, 6, 692858) He then ceases to be the owner of his property.
('57', 396, 3, 7, 692906) He must then live within the commission which as a trustee he gets from the property.
('57', 396, 3, 8, 692992) This is the meaning of trust.
('57', 396, 3, 9, 693022) I am not talking here about trustees who abuse their office and misappropriate the property.
('57', 396, 3, 10, 693115) I am only explaining here the duties of a trustee.
('57', 396, 3, 11, 693166) You say that you want to acquire strength to stand on your own feet.
('57', 396, 3, 12, 693235) Do you understand what that means?
('57', 396, 3, 13, 693270) To stand on your feet means that you will not depend on your father’s earnings, nor on your father in law’s, nor your husband’s but subsist on your own earnings, however small they may be.
('57', 396, 3, 14, 693459) You have never shown evidence of such strength in you.
('57', 396, 3, 15, 693514) Nor did I ever observe any such desire in you.
('57', 396, 3, 16, 693561) In the past I have congratulated persons whose houses had been burgled.
('57', 396, 3, 17, 693633) My attitude is the same in this case.
('57', 396, 3, 18, 693671) We have no moral right to possess a single pie.
('57', 396, 3, 19, 693719) Whatever we possess is as good as stolen property.
('57', 396, 3, 20, 693770) Since all people in the world are thieves, possessions are not looked upon as theft.
('57', 396, 3, 21, 693855) That, however, should not blind us to the truth.
('57', 396, 3, 22, 693904) Is it any matter for wonder if other thieves rob us of some of the stolen property in our possession?
('57', 396, 3, 23, 694006) The lesson you should draw from this theft is that you should not possess things which would tempt a thief, and that you may use the few things which you possess as long as they are not stolen.
('57', 396, 3, 24, 694200) If you learn that lesson from the theft, you will have lost nothing but on the contrary gained wisdom.

('57', 396, 5, 28, 694399) The reference to the theft in the letter however indicates that this was written to Champabehn Mehta, wife of Ratilal Mehta, whose house had been burgled.

('57', 397, 21, 27, 695780) 1 In “Letter to an Indian Friend” published in News letter, Lord Sankey had observed : “I believe that if Gandhi dropped the weapon of civil disobedience and offered to co operate with the British Government the whole situation would be trans formed.
('57', 397, 21, 28, 696031) “The problem will be solved by a united effort to secure agreement among Indians.
('57', 397, 21, 29, 696113) Their refusal to assist the cause of peace is as much a weapon of war as tanks and aeroplanes.
('57', 397, 21, 30, 696208) No federation can be successful if the people refuse to federate.
('57', 397, 21, 31, 696274) Twice in the past few years while we were doing our utmost to arrive at an agreed solution through consultation and co operation others endeavoured to achieve their ends by a civil disobedience movement.
('57', 397, 21, 32, 696478) So long as this is your work, mine is made more difficult.
('57', 397, 21, 33, 696537) “Gandhi has power to change the situation and can do much to restore peace.
('57', 397, 21, 34, 696613) Civil disobedience does not strike individuals but ordinary organized Governments and civilized society.
('57', 397, 21, 35, 696718) I believe that if Gandhi made the great gesture and dropped the weapon of civil disobedience and with his followers offered to co operate with the British Government the whole situation would be transformed.” The Statesman, 12 11 1932. 2 For Gandhiji’s correspondence with the Viceroy on the subject.

('57', 400, 9, 15, 701636) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('57', 400, 9, 16, 701669) Your argument seems to be this: Bhagavad Gita refers the devotee to shastravidhi and since Shastras support untouchability, Bhagavad Gita must be said to support it.
('57', 400, 9, 17, 701835) The question then is what are Shastras?
('57', 400, 9, 18, 701875) And I have answered that question by the answer that whatever is contrary to the main theme of the Gita must be rejected as being no Shastra.
('57', 400, 9, 19, 702017) And since the main theme is oneness and therefore equality of all life, there is no warrant for untouchability in the Gita.
('57', 400, 10, 20, 702141) Yours sincerely,

('57', 401, 13, 21, 703203) JAMNADAS,
('57', 401, 14, 22, 703213) You are blaming me, instead of yourself.
('57', 401, 14, 23, 703254) You wrote to me after many months and are now impatient to get a reply.
('57', 401, 14, 24, 703326) The fact, however, is that I did reply to your letter by return of post.
('57', 401, 14, 25, 703399) I got your second letter.
('57', 401, 14, 26, 703425) You will continue to have difficulty about money, but I am sure that at the critical hour God will send you what you need.
('57', 401, 14, 27, 703548) If somehow you can improve your health, I would regard it as a

('57', 402, 1, 3, 703837) Do not be unnecessarily diffident.
('57', 402, 1, 4, 703872) Why do you not rest happy after doing your best?
('57', 402, 1, 5, 703921) Why do you think that you should have as much strength as you desire?
('57', 402, 1, 6, 703991) Your experience about Harijans is both interesting and painful.
('57', 402, 1, 7, 704055) But that is the state of affairs everywhere.
('57', 402, 1, 8, 704100) You can come whenever you like and see me in connection with this work.
('57', 402, 1, 9, 704172) Now that you have started writing to me, keep it up.
('57', 402, 1, 10, 704225) It is for me to judge whether what you write is foolishness or wisdom.

('57', 402, 11, 22, 704697) If you think that you should go and stay with your aunt’s people for a few days after her death, you may do so.
('57', 402, 11, 23, 704809) As regards the taunt to Dhiru, you should not get angry or be upset if anybody has said that.
('57', 402, 11, 24, 704903) Just as we should not take it seriously if somebody asks us to leave our own home, so also you should not take it seriously if anybody, who has known you long enough, still asks a woman like you to leave the Ashram, much less so if that is said to a child.
('57', 402, 11, 25, 705160) There is no doubt, however, that nobody should utter such threats.

('57', 403, 3, 13, 705862) Now that you have discovered the cause of your disease, you should find the remedy too.
('57', 403, 3, 14, 705950) You ask me about my feelings, but you can learn nothing about them.
('57', 403, 3, 15, 706018) No one can analyse his own feelings.
('57', 403, 3, 16, 706055) When we seem unable to follow a principle in life, we should conclude that we have not understood the principle correctly.
('57', 403, 3, 17, 706178) A principle which is correct ought to be capable of being followed in life.
('57', 403, 3, 18, 706254) Of course no principle can be perfectly acted upon.
('57', 403, 3, 19, 706306) But a way of life which does not conform to a principle as nearly as possible is insincere and we should avoid it.

('57', 407, 3, 5, 710312) I got another small packet too.
('57', 407, 3, 6, 710344) You will find with this a letter for Champa.
('57', 407, 3, 7, 710389) Read it before you pass it on to her, for it contains my views on thefts and so, if you read it, I need not write the same thing again.
('57', 407, 3, 8, 710525) You should explain my advice to others too, for I have repeated it every time there has been a theft.
('57', 407, 3, 9, 710627) It is also necessary that you should glance through what I have advised Champa concerning her duty.
('57', 407, 3, 10, 710727) In the existing circumstances, I will not include your name among the trustees.
('57', 407, 3, 11, 710807) I will never knowingly take any step which will put you in an embarrassing position.
('57', 407, 3, 12, 710892) Our ideal is to do a duty which comes to us unsought.
('57', 407, 3, 13, 710946) We have no other interest.
('57', 407, 3, 14, 710973) In any case, we should never seek a position of authority or influence for its own sake.
('57', 407, 3, 15, 711062) If you remember, and if available, please send some oranges and mosambis from there as samples with anybody who may be coming here.
('57', 407, 3, 16, 711194) I am very happy though the trees yield only a few.
('57', 407, 3, 17, 711245) I do not mind the expenditure on trees and other farming activities.
('57', 407, 3, 18, 711314) It is possible that some of the expenditure was unnecessary, but my impression is that on the whole it was all right.
('57', 407, 3, 19, 711432) I hope you have written to Prabhudas and made the necessary inquiries for Navin.
('57', 407, 3, 20, 711513) Damodar should have informed you that he had not gone to the bungalow to sleep at night.
('57', 407, 3, 21, 711602) If you feel that it is impossible to influence the Chharas 2 go and see Mavalankar and do whatever is possible.
('57', 407, 3, 22, 711714) In the last resort, we can of course endure the present state of things.
('57', 407, 3, 23, 711787) I hope that Shelat’s children have recovered.
('57', 407, 3, 24, 711833) I know from a letter of Chhaganlal Joshi that Shelat has got a book entitled Flowers of St. Francis.
('57', 407, 3, 25, 711934) If he has it, get it from him and send it to me with somebody who may be coming here.
('57', 407, 3, 26, 712020) Its value lies in the fact that it was a loving gift from somebody.

('57', 408, 1, 2, 712289) I understand what you say about Balbhadra.
('57', 408, 1, 3, 712332) I got a postcard from Ramji, in which he says that, after reading my recent statements about untouchability, he wished to come and see me.
('57', 408, 1, 4, 712471) I am sure he will also take the opportunity to pour out his complaints.
('57', 408, 1, 5, 712543) Even then, it seems to me that it will be good to let him come here once.
('57', 408, 1, 6, 712617) Moreover, he will be permitted to see me whenever he comes.
('57', 408, 1, 7, 712677) As regards the rach and heddle which we require for weaving khadi from fine yarn, I have just remembered that we had these implements which were made for weaving khadi from very fine yarn.
('57', 408, 1, 8, 712866) We had got them from Adamji Miankhan.
('57', 408, 1, 9, 712904) I also remember that Maganlal had made a number of heddles for weaving khadi from coarse yarn by breaking up this same heddle.
('57', 408, 1, 10, 713031) In any case, we had quite a large number of heddles.
('57', 408, 1, 11, 713084) They are probably lying in some corner among old discarded things.
('57', 408, 1, 12, 713151) Ask somebody to search for them and, if you cannot get them inquire at Miankhan’s place.
('57', 408, 1, 13, 713240) They may be able to find another heddle of that type, or at any rate get one manufactured.
('57', 408, 1, 14, 713331) They were four brothers, Adamji, Gulam Husain, Chandabhai, and one more whose name I do not recollect.
('57', 408, 1, 15, 713434) Of these Adamji is dead, Gulam Husain lives mostly in Natal and Chandabhai divides his time between Natal and Ahmedabad.
('57', 408, 1, 16, 713555) Chhaganlal knows him personally.
('57', 408, 1, 17, 713588) Even if none of you knows his address in Ahmedabad, Chhaganlal is sure to know it.
('57', 408, 1, 18, 713671) Most probably his house is in Vohravad in Kalupur and he has also a bungalow near Ellis Bridge.
('57', 408, 1, 19, 713767) The elder Kusum is your neighbour.
('57', 408, 1, 20, 713802) Try to get some news about her if you can.
('57', 408, 1, 21, 713845) And also go and see her if any of you is permitted to do so, and send her books, etc., if she wants them.
('57', 408, 1, 22, 713951) Rice and potatoes are like poison for Tilakam.
('57', 408, 1, 23, 713998) Moreover, both contain pure starch.
('57', 408, 1, 24, 714034) Then how can he feel energetic?
('57', 408, 1, 25, 714066) Starch does not make one energetic, on the contrary it produces acidity in the stomach.
('57', 408, 1, 26, 714154) Tilakam should only drink milk, as much as he can digest, and eat fruit and green vegetables.
('57', 408, 1, 27, 714248) After he is able to digest these things, he can add bread.
('57', 408, 1, 28, 714307) Do what you think proper about Jethalal.
('57', 408, 1, 29, 714348) As soon as Purush ottam feels constipated, you should understand that the trouble has started.
('57', 408, 1, 30, 714443) Trying city water will most probably not help him.
('57', 408, 1, 31, 714494) It would be much better for him to drink the Ashram water itself after boiling it.
('57', 408, 1, 32, 714577) To cure the weakness of his bowels, pranayama excercises and light massage of the abdomen are necessary.

('57', 409, 1, 2, 714724) If Kusum herself can live cheerfully in the Ashram and follow the three important rules which I have suggested, I would be relieved of my fear and worry on her account irrespective of what the final result might be.
('57', 409, 1, 3, 714940) Why did not Raojibhai write the revised letter?
('57', 409, 1, 4, 714988) So you explained to Kasumba, with logical arguments, that by eating in your company she had lost caste.
('57', 409, 1, 5, 715092) If a person thus states the plain truth, instead of deceiving himself or anybody else, he would enjoy much greater peace of mind and also earn greater merit.
('57', 409, 1, 6, 715250) The mendicant could have been the cause of so much fuss only in the Ashram.
('57', 409, 1, 7, 715326) Even if we do not discover the true meaning of the Vedas, I am sure we shall be able to call ourselves vedias 1. It is a mercy that in this world things people do are more foolish than wicked.
('57', 409, 1, 8, 715519) You know this very well indeed, otherwise you would have had to be sent to an asylum long ago.
('57', 409, 1, 9, 715614) I have not yet read Parasram’s letter, but even without reading it, after reading your letter and your recommendation, I give my consent for giving him the things which he has asked for.
('57', 409, 1, 10, 715801) Sunday Afternoon, November 13, 1932 [PS.] I give to the hand as much rest as it needs.
('57', 409, 1, 11, 715888) My weight has reached 102 pounds this week.
('57', 409, 1, 12, 715932) But my strength has not increased to the same extent.
('57', 409, 1, 13, 715986) I hope my articles do not upset people there.
('57', 409, 1, 14, 716032) It is an occasion for rejoicing.
('57', 409, 1, 15, 716065) I will ask Rajaji about Ba.
('57', 409, 1, 16, 716093) Urmiladevi is certain to go there.
('57', 409, 1, 17, 716128) Read my letter to Liladhar.
('57', 409, 1, 18, 716156) Morning, Silence Day [November 14, 1932] [PPS.] Vinoba’s explanation of the importance of the takli is worth pondering over by everybody.
('57', 409, 1, 19, 716294) He should learn from Bhau the art of spinning on it.

('57', 410, 1, 2, 716528) 668. STATEMENT ON UNTOUCHABILITY V
('57', 410, 2, 3, 716563) November 14, 1932 In this fifth statement to the Press, in which I would like to express my gratefulness for the publicity they are giving to my statements and movement generally, I want to summarize a part of what I said last week to Sjt.
('57', 410, 2, 4, 716803) Rajbhoj and his friends, 1 who met me to discuss practically the whole movement.
('57', 410, 2, 5, 716884) One of their questions related to what Harijans could do in order to help the movement.
('57', 410, 2, 6, 716972) They could do a great deal in the direction.
('57', 410, 2, 7, 717017) They could anticipate the charges brought against them in justification of the refusal of some caste Hindus to associate with them on terms of absolute equality.
('57', 410, 2, 8, 717179) I have already said in emphatic language that the caste Hindus are wholly to blame for the undoubtedly deplorable condition of the vast mass of Harijans and that the improvement will follow the removal of untouchability as a matter of course.
('57', 410, 2, 9, 717422) It should never be made a condition of removal.
('57', 410, 2, 10, 717470) Nevertheless, it is the obvious duty of Harijan workers to carry on internal reform to the extent it is possible even in the face of the existing state of things.
('57', 410, 2, 11, 717633) Harijan workers should therefore devote all their energy to : (1) the promotion of cleanliness and hygiene among Harijans, (2) to improve the method of carrying on what are known as unclean occupations, such as scavenging and tanning, (3) giving up of carrion and beef, if not meat altogether, (4) giving up of intoxicating liquors, (5) inducing parents to send their children to day schools wherever they are available and parents themselves to attend night schools wherever such are opened, and (6) abolition of untouchability among themselves.
('57', 410, 2, 12, 718180) Let me go through the items to indicate what is meant by them.
('57', 410, 2, 13, 718243) A daily bath is necessary at least in our climate, and clean clothes are necessary under all climates.
('57', 410, 2, 14, 718346) I know that water is not easily available in Harijan quarters.
('57', 410, 2, 15, 718409) They have, as a rule, no access to public wells and tanks, and they are too poor to afford a change of clothing.
('57', 410, 2, 16, 718522) It is not generally realized that even a lota full of water can give one a clean bath.
('57', 410, 2, 17, 718609) It is taken by thoroughly wetting a clean towel and vigorously
('57', 410, 3, 18, 718672) 1Vide “Interview to P.N. Rajbhoj”, 11 11 1932.
('57', 411, 0, 1, 718719) 412 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 411, 1, 2, 718761) rubbing the body, including the head, all over, and then wiping with a dry towel.
('57', 411, 1, 3, 718843) If the bath is taken daily, the wet towel after wringing out all water from it can serve the purpose of drying the body.
('57', 411, 1, 4, 718964) In this climate again, the same clothes can be easily washed and dried there and then, whilst one has merely the langoti on.
('57', 411, 1, 5, 719089) I know there is nothing new in what I am saying, and yet I have been obliged to explain these very elementary things to hundreds of workers.
('57', 411, 1, 6, 719230) Even graduates have been found to be ignorant of these elementary aids to hygiene as to the improved method of scavenging.
('57', 411, 1, 7, 719353) Selfish, ignorant caste men make it well nigh impossible to remove human remains in a decent manner.
('57', 411, 1, 8, 719454) The closets, because of the untouchability, are unclean beyond description.
('57', 411, 1, 9, 719530) They are dark and ill ventilated and so constructed that only a portion is somewhat capable of being cleaned and that too under filthy conditions.
('57', 411, 1, 10, 719677) To use these closets is a positive daily descent to Hell and but for the beneficent climate many more thousands than already do will find an early cremation.
('57', 411, 1, 11, 719835) Owing to the superstitious refusal to see one’s own faeces and to permit the untouchables or themselves to clean the interior of the closet, the Harijans who have to perform the very necessary social service can even in the existing unfavourable circumstances at least have their bath immediately after the cleaning is done and use plenty of dry earth for cleaning instead of just a little straw that they use.
('57', 411, 1, 12, 720246) Being an expert scavenger that I claim to be, I could show many very cheap, efficient and thoroughly clean methods of performing this service, especially if the villagers and city people would help, but I cannot deal with this interesting subject in this cursory statement.
('57', 411, 1, 13, 720520) The curious may look up my writings on sanitation in general, and village sanitation in particular.
('57', 411, 1, 14, 720620) Scavengers should wear a professional dress, while they are doing the cleaning work.
('57', 411, 1, 15, 720705) Every employer or a group of employers can supply such a dress for his or their scavengers.
('57', 411, 1, 16, 720797) Clean tanning is a far more difficult proposition.
('57', 411, 1, 17, 720848) Our tanners do not know the modern method of skinning carcases nor of tanning.
('57', 411, 1, 18, 720927) Tanning I have here used in a comprehensive sense.
('57', 411, 1, 19, 720978) The so called higher classes having criminally neglected this useful body of their co religionists and fellow countrymen, the whole of the process from the carrying of the carcase to the dressing of the hide is done in a crude manner resulting in the loss to the country of untold wealth and the production of inferior hide.
('57', 412, 0, 1, 721303) VOL. 57 : 5 SEPTEMBER, 1932 15 NOVEMBER, 1932 413
('57', 412, 1, 2, 721353) The late Madhusudan Das, 1 who was a great philanthropist and had himself learnt the modern process of tanning, had prepared statistics to show what the country was losing annually owing to the superstition of untouchability masquerading under the name of religion.
('57', 412, 1, 3, 721619) Harijan workers can learn the modern method and acquaint the tanners with it in so far as it is practicable.
('57', 412, 1, 4, 721728) The scavengers should be taught resolutely not to accept the remains of the householder’s daily food which is virtually thrown at them in the cruellest manner possible.
('57', 412, 1, 5, 721897) Years of habit have dulled the aesthetic sense of the scavengers and they see nothing wrong in eating the remains of another man’s dishes.
('57', 412, 1, 6, 722036) They crave for what they regard as dainties from their employers’ dishes.
('57', 412, 1, 7, 722110) I have known Bhangis having removed their children from school because the latter were taught not to touch these leavings and be satisfied with the jowar or the bajri bread baked in their homes.
('57', 412, 1, 8, 722305) Tanners should be induced to give up carrion and beef.
('57', 412, 1, 9, 722360) As a vegetarian, I would like Harijans to give up, as many have done, meat altogether, but if they are not ready for this reform they should be taught to give up carrion as being unhygienic, besides being taboo by the rest of mankind and beef as being forbidden in Hinduism.
('57', 412, 1, 10, 722635) I know that carrion is part of the price they get for removing the carcases.
('57', 412, 1, 11, 722712) Dr. Ambedkar told me that in some places villagers beat those who had given up carrion, telling them it was their religion to eat it.
('57', 412, 1, 12, 722846) The fact was that they were afraid that if the tanners gave up carrion eating they would demand an equivalent price or give up carrying dead cattle.
('57', 412, 1, 13, 722995) Whatever the difficulty, carrion and beef eating must be given up.
('57', 412, 1, 14, 723062) That one self restraint will at once raise the Harijans in the estimation of the caste men and make the task of caste reformers comparatively easy in the campaign against untouchability.
('57', 412, 1, 15, 723249) Items four and five do not call for any remarks.
('57', 412, 1, 16, 723298) They are self explained.
('57', 412, 1, 17, 723323) The last item is abolition of untouchability among untouc hables themselves.
('57', 412, 1, 18, 723400) This is an urgent need.
('57', 412, 1, 19, 723424) Removal of untouchability will become most difficult if this double untouchability is not removed with one sweep.
('57', 412, 1, 20, 723538) It is an uphill task for Harijan reformers.
('57', 412, 1, 21, 723582) But if they will realize that this movement is predominantly religious and
('57', 412, 2, 22, 723657) 1 In fact, Madhusudan Das was not dead.
('57', 412, 2, 23, 723697) Gandhiji came to know of his mistake later from a member of the Ashram and at once apologized to Madhusudan Das.
('57', 412, 2, 24, 723810) Vide Vol. LII, “Telegram to Madhusudan Das”, 18 11 1932.
('57', 413, 0, 1, 723867) 414 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 413, 1, 2, 723909) is designed to purge Hinduism of the uncleanness that has crept into it, they will have the necessary courage and self confidence to carry out the great reform.
('57', 413, 1, 3, 724070) It is needless for me to stress the point that workers in such a movement must be selfless and pure in character.
('57', 413, 1, 4, 724184) I have given here a constructive programme that should satisfy the most ambitious reformer among Harijans and occupy the whole of his time and energy.
('57', 413, 1, 5, 724335) But there are one or two things he and the Harijans may not do during this period of grace.
('57', 413, 1, 6, 724427) At any rate, no Harijan need fast against anyone nor need satyagraha be offered by them.
('57', 413, 1, 7, 724516) Let them watch the caste Hindus who are on their trial and see what they do to remove the bar that separates the Harijans from them.
('57', 413, 1, 8, 724649) Let them not engage in quarrels with local caste Hindus.
('57', 413, 1, 9, 724706) Their behaviour should be at all times courteous and dignified, much more so at this time.
('57', 413, 1, 10, 724797) Religion can only be vindicated by self suffering, never by violence done to the oppressors though there may be many things they may get by force.
('57', 413, 1, 11, 724944) Their credit will lie in getting their rights by the conversion of caste Hindus and today they have ample reason for deriving hope from the knowledge that there are tens of thousands of caste Hindus who have a lively sense of their guilt and are straining every nerve to do reparation to Harijans.
('57', 413, 1, 12, 725242) Let them have perfect confidence in the absolute justice of their cause and in the ability of self suffering to win it.
('57', 413, 1, 13, 725362) In the next statement 1 I must give my reply to caste men who have asked what they can do to help the movement.

('57', 414, 6, 9, 726025) BHAU, I am afraid I am writing this letter very late, as you will get it twelve days after the fast was ended.
('57', 414, 6, 10, 726136) I wrote to you in my previous letter what food you should eat.
('57', 414, 6, 11, 726199) You may make a few changes in it to suit your constituion.
('57', 414, 6, 12, 726258) The fast may be said to have succeeded only if you pass stool naturally without enema in six or seven days or before that, feel sufficiently hungry, can easily digest simple food, put on weight and also regain your strength.
('57', 414, 6, 13, 726483) If, however, you do not pass stool without enema, then you should take a purgative.
('57', 414, 6, 14, 726567) Castor oil is very good.
('57', 414, 6, 15, 726592) Take about two tea spoon fuls of it immediately after brushing your teeth in the morning.
('57', 414, 6, 16, 726682) If you put a little salt in the mouth, then swallow the castor oil and then again lick some salt, you will not feel the unpleasant flavour of castor oil.
('57', 414, 6, 17, 726836) After this, you are sure to pass stool without taking enema.
('57', 414, 6, 18, 726897) If you do not, you may conclude that your bowels are still not clear.
('57', 414, 6, 19, 726967) You may, in that case, fast again after a few days when you are strong enough.
('57', 414, 6, 20, 727046) But this is the only method of curing constipation.
('57', 414, 6, 21, 727098) I fully believe in the importance of takli explained by Vinoba in his letter.
('57', 414, 6, 22, 727176) I have no doubt whatever that a person who spins on the takli in a spirit of service and as yajna will attain deliverance.
('57', 414, 7, 23, 727299) BAPU [PS.] Can you teach your method of spinning on a takli by explai ning it in a letter?

('57', 415, 2, 3, 727597) November 14, 1932
('57', 415, 3, 4, 727615) DEAR MAJOR BHANDARI, You know by now the late Dr. Mehta about whom I received so many telegrams when he died recently.
('57', 415, 3, 5, 727734) 1 I am trying to look after his affairs as far as possible from here.
('57', 415, 3, 6, 727804) I have now to advise the members of Dr. Mehta’s family about the disposal of the estate he has left behind him.
('57', 415, 3, 7, 727916) He was a diamond merchant and landed proprietor in Rangoon where he had settled many years ago.
('57', 415, 3, 8, 728012) It is necessary for me to see some or all of those in the enclosed list 2 in connection with his affairs.
('57', 415, 3, 9, 728118) None of them has ever been engaged in politics, and with the exception of two the rest have business in Burma.
('57', 415, 3, 10, 728229) As you are aware, before the fast I had dropped receiving weekly visits altogether.
('57', 415, 3, 11, 728313) After the fast I have occasionally had such visits chiefly from my wife and children.
('57', 415, 3, 12, 728399) But with reference to the enclosed list it might be necessary for me to see those who will come continually from day to day till the matter is settled.
('57', 415, 3, 13, 728551) I trust that the Government will have no objection to my request being granted as early as possible.

('57', 415, 7, 19, 728816) November 14, 1932 You have done well in sending your letter and also copies of letters and telegrams passed between the Zamorin and Kelappan.
('57', 415, 7, 20, 728958) Your letter and the enclosures have been most valuable to me.
('57', 415, 7, 21, 729020) The fast if it has to come won’t be against the Zamorin.
('57', 415, 7, 22, 729077) If the vast mass of Savarna Hindus are really in favour of the temple being opened to the Avarnas, do you not feel that the temple cannot be closed against them even by the Zamorin?
('57', 415, 7, 23, 729259) It is not his property.
('57', 415, 7, 24, 729283) It should be remembered that he does not make any claim himself and admits that he is only a trustee.
('57', 415, 7, 25, 729385) And let us assume for the moment that he is a
('57', 415, 8, 26, 729431) 1 Dr. Pranjivan Mehta died in Rangoon on August 3. 2 This is not available.
('57', 415, 8, 27, 729507) 3 The request was granted by the Government.

('57', 416, 1, 2, 729602) trustee only for the Savarna Hindus, who alone are the temple goers.
('57', 416, 1, 3, 729671) Then the key to the temple is in their hands and the Zamorin holds the key for them.
('57', 416, 1, 4, 729756) Then if the Savarnas are in earnest, there are many ways of their showing their wish in unmistakable terms.
('57', 416, 1, 5, 729864) Has an attempt ever been made to take a referendum of all the Savarnas, men and women, making use of the temple?
('57', 416, 1, 6, 729977) If the position is not as I imagine it to be, and if the Savarnas have no rights, if the trust is not held for them, I should then be informed of the correct position.
('57', 416, 1, 7, 730145) It would then be time for you to ask me to revise my decision.
('57', 416, 1, 8, 730208) If, for instance, the temple is the private property of the Zamorin, if in other words he could shut the doors of the temple against anybody entering it, if he is so willed, the whole of the agitation for opening Guruvayur to the Harijans was wrong from the commencement and we have to retrace our steps.
('57', 416, 1, 9, 730513) Let all the workers examine the position from this viewpoint.
('57', 416, 1, 10, 730575) If a mistake has been made there need be no shame in an open confession.

('57', 417, 2, 3, 731141) November 14, 1932 I quite agree with you that no one should be treated as untou chable and I am sure that when we have ceased to treat forty millions of Hindus as such, we shall cease to treat Christians and Mussalmans as such.

('57', 417, 5, 7, 731506) The real way to pray to Lord Krishna is to do in His name some little service to those who are less fortunate than ourselves; and when we show the spirit of service in daily life, unbelieving neighbours will begin to believe in God.
('57', 417, 5, 8, 731739) You can do untouchability work by yourself going among untouchables and rendering such service as is possible to them as if, they were members of our own family.
('57', 417, 5, 9, 731901) If you do not know Hindi, you should quickly learn it.

('57', 417, 8, 12, 732029) November 15, 1932
('57', 417, 9, 13, 732047) If, among the Harijans, Sjt.
('57', 417, 9, 14, 732076) Rajbhoj has yet been the only one to have asked me what Harijans might do to advance the movement, I have scores of letters from all parts of India, from caste Hindus, both men and women, students and others, inquiring in what way they can help without interfering with their other preoccupations; and since anti untouchability is a movement, as applied to the masses, of merely change of heart and changing their attitude towards Harijans, the vast majority of the caste Hindus do not need to interrupt their daily activities in order to serve the Harijans.
('57', 417, 10, 15, 732635) 1 The addressee, not identified in the source, had asked: “Do we not treat others—such as Christians, etc.—also as untouchables?” 2 The addressee, a young boy not identified in the source, had asked in what way he could do service.
('57', 418, 0, 1, 732867) VOL. 57 : 5 SEPTEMBER, 1932 15 NOVEMBER, 1932 419
('57', 418, 1, 2, 732917) The first thing is for everyone to understand the implications of the removal of untouchability in his or her own life, and if the answer is that he or she has not only no objection to, but is desirous of, seeing them entering public temples, using public places, such as schools, serais, roads, hospitals, dispensaries and the like, in short, to Harijans being put precisely on the same footing as themselves religiously, socially, economically and politically, he or she has personally taken the full step.
('57', 418, 1, 3, 733426) But that is not all that the questioners want or all that I should be satisfied with.
('57', 418, 1, 4, 733512) Having gone so far, they want to know what more they can do in the furtherance of the cause.
('57', 418, 1, 5, 733605) Such inquirers need not extend their activities beyond their immediate neighbourhood.
('57', 418, 1, 6, 733691) Let them canvass the opinion of those with whom they come in daily contact, and if the former are not convinced of the necessity of removal of untouchability, they should, if they have critically studied the movement, endeavour to convince their neighbours or, if they are not competent, they should procure the necessary literature, supply them with it and put them in touch with those full time workers who are specially qualified for such propaganda work.
('57', 418, 1, 7, 734150) If they find that their neighbourhood is not touched by the spirit of the movement, and if they have any influence, they should arrange public lectures and demonstrations.
('57', 418, 1, 8, 734322) So much for the work among caste Hindus.
('57', 418, 1, 9, 734363) But the real work that this large body of men and women can do is undoubtedly among the Harijans.
('57', 418, 1, 10, 734461) Those caste Hindus who have studied my fifth statement could not fail to have noticed that there is a vast amount of silent and effective service to be rendered by caste Hindus without much expenditure of time, energy or money.
('57', 418, 1, 11, 734689) Caste Hindus can effectively supplement the effort of Harijan workers in inculcating habits of cleanliness and by procuring facilities for having easy access to the required water supply.
('57', 418, 1, 12, 734877) They can find out public wells and tanks situated near Harijan quarters and canvass the opinion of caste Hindus who may be using such wells or tanks, pointing out to them that Harijans have a legal right to the use of all such public services.
('57', 418, 1, 13, 735121) And they can, at the same time, see to it that when the consent of caste Hindus has been secured for the use by Harijans of these services, the latter use them in a manner not offensive to the former.
('57', 418, 1, 14, 735322) As to scavenging, they can visit the owners of houses served by Harijans in their neighbourhood and explain to them the necessity of making it easy for Harijans to do the cleaning work in a hygienic
('57', 419, 0, 1, 735521) 420 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 419, 1, 2, 735563) manner.
('57', 419, 1, 3, 735571) To this end, it would be naturally necessary for them to study the scientific method of constructing closets and disposing of night soil.
('57', 419, 1, 4, 735709) Thy can also procure from the householders special dresses to be supplied to the scavengers and make the Harijans feel by unhesitatingly doing the scavenging themselves that there is nothing low or undignified about rendering such service.
('57', 419, 1, 5, 735949) Such workers should also carry on propaganda against caste men giving to their scavengers leavings from their daily food and, where they are ill paid persuading the employers to pay them a decent wage.
('57', 419, 1, 6, 736151) As to tanning, not much help can be rendered, unless someone of such voluntary leisure time workers has humanity and enthusiasm enough to study the hygienic method of skinning carcases and having done so, will spread the knowledge among tanners.
('57', 419, 1, 7, 736397) They certainly can do one thing.
('57', 419, 1, 8, 736430) They can find out the custom about the disposal of such carcases and see that the tanners are assured of a proper wage for the service they rendered.
('57', 419, 1, 9, 736580) Those who have capacity and time can conduct day or night schools, take Harijan children for picnics and sightseeing on holidays or whenever an opportunity occurs, visit Harijans in their own homes, procure medical aid where necessary and generally let them feel that a new page has been opened in their lives and that they need no longer regard themselves as the neglected and despised portion of Hindu humanity.
('57', 419, 1, 10, 736994) All that I have described can be most easily and efficiently done by the student world.
('57', 419, 1, 11, 737082) If this work is done with silent zeal, determination and intelligence by a large body of men and women, I have no doubt that we shall have taken many steps in our progress towards the goal, and it would be found too that there are more things than I have described that require attention.
('57', 419, 1, 12, 737371) I have but chosen a few of the many things that have come under my observation in the course of my journeyings.

('57', 420, 15, 18, 738179) DEAR COL.
('57', 420, 15, 19, 738189) DOYLE, Sjt.
('57', 420, 15, 20, 738201) Dahyabhai is the only son of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
('57', 420, 15, 21, 738256) He has been suffering from fever for the last eight days.
('57', 420, 15, 22, 738314) Doctors have now pronounced it to be typhoid.
('57', 420, 15, 23, 738360) It is necessary to inform his sister Manibehn Patel who is in the Central Prison, Belgaum, of Dhaybhai’s illness from day to day.
('57', 420, 15, 24, 738490) I enclose draft of a telegram to be sent to her.
('57', 420, 15, 25, 738539) I hope you will kindly send it with instructions to the Superintendent to deliver it to Manibehn Patel and to receive from her whatever message she wishes to give.
('57', 420, 15, 26, 738703) And could I, whilst the fever lasts, give her detailed information from day to day and receive from her whatever

('57', 421, 1, 3, 738958) My reason for wishing her to send even a daily postcard is to pass it on to the patient.
('57', 421, 1, 4, 739047) It must cheer him to know that his only sister is being kept informed of the progress of his illness and that she sends him messages of love.

('57', 421, 8, 11, 739366) Anyway, if there is legal difficulty we must patiently create public opinion that would demand even legislative interference.
('57', 421, 8, 12, 739492) You have therefore to mobilize Savarna opinion in favour of the opening of the Guruvayur temple.
('57', 421, 8, 13, 739589) Do not mix up the issue by raising the cry of general entry into all temples.
('57', 421, 8, 14, 739667) Mr. Kelappan’s fast 3 was directed to the opening of the Guruvayur temple and if it has to be resumed, it must be restricted to that purpose.
('57', 421, 8, 15, 739809) If that temple is opened it will be only a question of time for other temples also to be opened, but we must be true to ourselves.
('57', 421, 8, 16, 739940) There should be no abuse hurled at the Zamorin.
('57', 421, 8, 17, 739988) Combat his position by all means when that is necessary.
('57', 421, 8, 18, 740045) I have read his statement.
('57', 421, 8, 19, 740072) If Kelappan has been discourteous, he should apologize.
('57', 421, 8, 20, 740128) But in my opinion, the Zamorin is wrong in saying that his assurance was cancelled by Mr. Kelappan’s discourtesy.

('57', 422, 2, 4, 740543) I am quite clear in my mind as to the course you have to follow.
('57', 422, 2, 5, 740608) You should forget the man and the deed.
('57', 422, 2, 6, 740648) God alone punishes and rewards.
('57', 422, 2, 7, 740680) It was open to you, as I suppose it is even now, to prosecute the offender.
('57', 422, 2, 8, 740756) But that is clearly not what you intend to do.
('57', 422, 2, 9, 740803) After all he was not in his senses.
('57', 422, 2, 10, 740839) Who knows that some day he may not learn the lesson and become a better man?
('57', 422, 2, 11, 740916) If an opportunity offers for you to do a good turn to him you will not omit to do it.
('57', 422, 2, 12, 741002) You should console your wife and induce her to forget the incident.
('57', 422, 2, 13, 741070) Your daughter should not even be allowed to remember the incident.
('57', 422, 2, 14, 741137) I suppose she has no knowledge of what was attempted to be done to her.
('57', 422, 2, 15, 741209) But even if she has, she should be brought up so as to forget it altogether.

('57', 422, 5, 19, 741496) Nothing in this world remains fixed; things either progress or decline.
('57', 422, 5, 20, 741568) I did not write about people whom you imagine to be wicked.

('57', 437, 3, 4, 768950) (A) DISCUSSION WITH VALLABHBHAI PATEL September 6, 1932
('57', 437, 4, 5, 769006) GANDHIJI: You were, of course, joking in the morning, but if you really have any questions to ask please ask them.
('57', 437, 5, 6, 769121) VALLABHBHAI PATEL : What do you think will these people do?
('57', 437, 6, 7, 769181) G. I still feel that they will release me on or before the 19th.
('57', 437, 6, 8, 769246) It will be the limit of wickedness if they let me fast, let no one know about it and then say that I did what I as a prisoner ought not to have done, and that they could do nothing about it.
('57', 437, 6, 9, 769437) I do not say that they cannot go that far, only they will not find it necessary.
('57', 437, 6, 10, 769518) And they certainly are not the people to go further than it is necessary.
('57', 437, 7, 11, 769592) V. P. Then what will you do?
('57', 437, 8, 12, 769621) G. The fast cannot commence on the 20th.
('57', 437, 8, 13, 769662) We cannot stick to the 20th.
('57', 437, 9, 14, 769691) V. P. Does is not mean then that we have got time till the new constitution is drawn up?
('57', 437, 9, 15, 769780) Or that you can give a longer notice to the people and the Government?
('57', 437, 10, 16, 769851) G. Yes, but that depends on how much the people will allow me to do after I get out.
('57', 437, 10, 17, 769936) I cannot tell what the situation will be.
('57', 437, 10, 18, 769978) I have no idea of the kind of letter I may have to write.
('57', 437, 10, 19, 770036) But I shall have to consider everyparty—the Hindu society, the Antyajas, the Government, the Muslims.
('57', 437, 10, 20, 770138) It will be necessary for the Hindus to hold meetings along with the Antyajas at every place and reject this thing.
('57', 437, 10, 21, 770253) The Government has done this thing as a Christian Government and hence I shall have to tell both the Government and the Christians the same thing—that as Christians they cannot do this thing.
('57', 437, 10, 22, 770445) Let our swaraj come into being, then they may influence the Antyajas in any way they like, but they should not divide us today.
('57', 437, 10, 23, 770573) I had said this to the Muslims even in England.
('57', 437, 10, 24, 770621) I shall say the same thing here also.
('57', 437, 10, 25, 770659) I shall explain to the Hindu society that now the Antyajas have no choice but to turn Muslims or Christians.
('57', 437, 11, 26, 770768) V. P. But where are the Muslims here who will listen to you?
('57', 437, 12, 27, 770829) G. It does not matter if there aren’t any.
('57', 437, 12, 28, 770872) But we should hope that those people too will wake up.
('57', 437, 12, 29, 770927) The root of satyagraha lies in faith in human nature, in the faith that it will be possible to melt the cruellest of men.
('57', 437, 12, 30, 771049) So there will surely be some Muslim who will say that if things go to that length he will not be able to bear it.
('57', 437, 12, 31, 771163) To accomplish all this, I shall have to call certain people.

('57', 438, 1, 2, 771318) do not know whether all of them will be permitted to come here.
('57', 438, 1, 3, 771382) But they may even insult me.
('57', 438, 1, 4, 771411) They may say that they have released me because they will not take the responsibility for my death.
('57', 438, 1, 5, 771511) However, if I launch civil disobedience, they will have to put me back into prison.
('57', 438, 2, 6, 771595) MAHADEV DESAI : Among the people who will come will also be Christian friends and they will say to you that before accusing the Government you should accuse yourself.
('57', 438, 2, 7, 771762) Why does Hindu society regard the Antyajas as untouchables?
('57', 438, 3, 8, 771822) G. That is up to me to explain.
('57', 438, 3, 9, 771854) That is not a difficult thing.
('57', 438, 3, 10, 771885) We can say to them: ‘Allow us to settle our problems ourselves, why do you interfere?
('57', 438, 3, 11, 771971) After we have set about managing our own affairs, you may do what you like.
('57', 438, 3, 12, 772047) Why do you divide us and then argue over things?
('57', 438, 3, 13, 772096) Today the Antyajas have either to turn to Muslims or to you.
('57', 438, 3, 14, 772157) The question of women is similar to that of the Antyajas.
('57', 438, 3, 15, 772215) But women are not untouchables.
('57', 438, 3, 16, 772247) Even if they wish to become untouchables, men will go and sit on their beds.
('57', 438, 3, 17, 772324) They cannot be separated even by having a separate electorate.
('57', 438, 3, 18, 772387) Today the Antyajas have been separated permanently.
('57', 438, 3, 19, 772439) What would be the outcome of it?
('57', 438, 3, 20, 772472) There would be internal strife.
('57', 438, 3, 21, 772504) There are people like .
('57', 438, 3, 22, 772528) He would collect bad characters in the community and get them to attack Hindus, poison wells and do other things.
('57', 438, 4, 23, 772642) The duty of those of you who have remained here is merely to inform everyone in the Camp jail that fasting is wholly prohibited and that everyone must remain calm.

('57', 438, 6, 26, 772856) (B) DISCUSSION WITH B.R. AMBEDKAR
('57', 438, 7, 27, 772890) September 22, 1932
('57', 438, 8, 28, 772909) AMBEDKAR : We must accept that in the country there are two groups belonging to two different ideologies and act accordingly, and I should get my compensation.
('57', 438, 8, 29, 773069) I also want that a clear understanding should be arrived at which would recompense me in other respects also.
('57', 438, 8, 30, 773179) The decision of the Government gives me seventy one seats and I feel that is a just, reasonable and definite allocation.
('57', 438, 9, 31, 773300) GANDHI : According to you.
('57', 438, 10, 32, 773327) A. Over and above that I get the right to vote and contest elections in the general constituencies.
('57', 438, 10, 33, 773427) I also have a franchise in the labourers’constituencies.
('57', 438, 10, 34, 773484) We do realize that you are of immense help to us.
('57', 438, 11, 35, 773534) G. Not to you personally.
('57', 438, 12, 36, 773560) A. But I have only one quarrel with you, that is, you work for the so called national welfare and not for our interests alone.
('57', 438, 12, 37, 773687) If you devoted yourself entirely to the welfare of the Depressed Classes, you would then become our hero.
('57', 439, 0, 1, 773793) 440 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('57', 439, 1, 2, 773835) G. Very sweet of you to say so.
('57', 439, 2, 3, 773867) A. I want political power for my community.
('57', 439, 2, 4, 773911) That is indispensable for our
('57', 439, 3, 5, 773941) survival.
('57', 439, 3, 6, 773951) The basis of the agreement therefore should be: I should get what is due to
('57', 439, 4, 7, 774027) I wish to tell the Hindus that I should be assured of my compensation.
('57', 439, 5, 8, 774098) G. You have clarified your position very beautifully.
('57', 439, 5, 9, 774152) However, I should like to ask you one question.
('57', 439, 5, 10, 774200) You say that if there is any genuine party among the Depressed Classes it should be given sufficient scope to rise.
('57', 439, 5, 11, 774316) Therefore their refusal to accept joint electorates without primary elections is quite reasonable.
('57', 439, 5, 12, 774415) What I do not understand is why you have not said so far that there should be a separate election of this kind.
('57', 439, 5, 13, 774527) I feel from whatever study I have made of the subject that if I accept the primary election, the letter of my vow is not violated.
('57', 439, 5, 14, 774658) I therefore accept the Clause [of primary election] but I would most certainly have to scrutinize its wording.
('57', 439, 5, 15, 774769) At the moment, I say only this, that the idea of separate primary elections does not go against my vow.
('57', 439, 5, 16, 774873) But I suspect something when you insist that the panel should consist only of three candidates.
('57', 439, 5, 17, 774969) It does not give me sufficient place to turn in.
('57', 439, 5, 18, 775018) Moreover, you consider panel system for some seats only, thereby satisfying both the parties [among Harijans].
('57', 439, 5, 19, 775129) There would be one election, i.e., of the primary nature by the Harijan voters only.
('57', 439, 5, 20, 775214) The other would be by the joint electorate.
('57', 439, 5, 21, 775258) I have to safeguard without any discrimination not the interest of one group alone but of the Depressed Class as a whole.
('57', 439, 5, 22, 775380) I want to serve the untouchables.
('57', 439, 5, 23, 775414) That is why I am not at all angry with you.
('57', 439, 5, 24, 775458) When you use derogatory and angry words for me, I tell myself that I deserved that.
('57', 439, 5, 25, 775542) I will not get angry even if you spit on my face.
('57', 439, 5, 26, 775592) I say this with God as witness.
('57', 439, 5, 27, 775624) I know that you have drunk deep of the poisoned cup.
('57', 439, 5, 28, 775677) However, I make a claim which will seem astounding to you.
('57', 439, 5, 29, 775736) You are born an untouchable but I am an untouchable by adoption.
('57', 439, 5, 30, 775801) And as a new convert I feel more for the welfare of the community than those who are already there.
('57', 439, 5, 31, 775901) At the moment I have before my eyes the dumb untouchables—unapproachables and unseeables—of South India.
('57', 439, 5, 32, 776006) I am scrutinizing the scheme to see how these people will be affected by it.
('57', 439, 5, 33, 776083) You will of course say why I should worry about that.
('57', 439, 5, 34, 776137) All of you will either accept Christianity or Islam.
('57', 439, 5, 35, 776190) I say that you may do whatever you like after my body falls.
('57', 439, 5, 36, 776251) What I say is that if the panel system is good for the Depressed Classes it should be good for the entire electorate.
('57', 439, 5, 37, 776369) I do not like it from the beginning that the community should be divided into two groups.
('57', 439, 5, 38, 776459) I will raze to the ground the fort of sanatanists with dynamite if all the untouchables are one and united.
('57', 439, 5, 39, 776567) I want that the entire untouchable community should unitedly rebel against the sanatanists.
('57', 439, 5, 40, 776659) You should not worry about the number as long as the appointing power is in your hands.
('57', 439, 5, 41, 776747) I am a lifelong democrat.
('57', 439, 5, 42, 776773) The whole world will agree that I was the foremost among the democrats after my ashes are scattered in the air or, if that does not happen, after they are immersed in the Ganga.
('57', 439, 5, 43, 776951) I do not say this out of pride but tell the truth with humility.
('57', 439, 5, 44, 777016) I learnt the lesson of

('57', 440, 1, 2, 777089) democracy at the tender age of 12. I quarrelled with my mother for treating the domestic sweeper as an untouchable.
('57', 440, 1, 3, 777205) That day I saw God in the form of a Bhangi.
('57', 440, 1, 4, 777249) You spoke the truth when you said that the welfare of untouchables is dearer to you than my own life.
('57', 440, 1, 5, 777351) Now be honest and stick to it.
('57', 440, 1, 6, 777382) You should not care for my life.
('57', 440, 1, 7, 777415) But do not be false to Harijans.
('57', 440, 1, 8, 777448) My work will not die with me.
('57', 440, 1, 9, 777478) I have asked my son to convey my message to the Conference.
('57', 440, 1, 10, 777538) In that, I have said that they should not be tempted to forsake the interests of the Harijans in order to save my life.
('57', 440, 1, 11, 777658) I am sure that if I die my son will definitely follow me.
('57', 440, 1, 12, 777716) Not only he but many others also will lay down their lives, for I do not have only one son, I have thousands.
('57', 440, 1, 13, 777826) He would not be my worthy son if he did not lay down his life for the honour of Hinduism.
('57', 440, 1, 14, 777916) Without eradicating untouchability root and branch the honour of Hinduism cannot be saved.
('57', 440, 1, 15, 778007) That can only happen when untouchables are treated on par with caste Hindus in every respect.
('57', 440, 1, 16, 778101) A person who is regarded as ‘unseeable’ today should also have the opportunity to become the Viceroy of India.
('57', 440, 1, 17, 778212) I had said, in the first political speech I made on coming to India that I would like to make a Bhangi the President of the Congress.
('57', 440, 2, 18, 778346) So I appeal to you not to haggle.
('57', 440, 2, 19, 778380) Do not bring to me something which is so bad that I would not even like the look of it.
('57', 440, 2, 20, 778468) Bring to me some nice present which would inspire life into a person who is willingly courting death.
('57', 440, 2, 21, 778570) However you will do that only if you are convinced that my co operation has some value.

('57', 440, 6, 25, 778723) September 22, 1932
('57', 440, 7, 26, 778742) I do not see any objection from the point of view of my vow in the system of primary elections which Dr. Ambedkar has explained to me and which has been laid down in Clause B of the scheme given to me.
('57', 440, 7, 27, 778944) But before I finally accept any scheme, I would like to see it drafted in very clear language.
('57', 440, 7, 28, 779039) After that I will give my final decision on Clause B. I do not like its language.
('57', 440, 7, 29, 779121) It requires many changes.
('57', 440, 7, 30, 779147) I give below my objections against Clause B and its language.
('57', 440, 8, 31, 779209) (1) The system of primary elections and reserved seats should terminate automatically after 10 years.
('57', 440, 9, 32, 779311) (2) The number of votes should be ascertained from the Lothian Committee Report.
('57', 440, 9, 33, 779392) I have double objection against Clause B. Not only that it nullifies the object for which I have staked my life but it is harmful to the nation also.

('57', 441, 6, 10, 780039) Your love for me is inspired by my determination, my strength to give up my life.
('57', 441, 6, 11, 780121) Hence those of you who love me should let me go.
('57', 441, 6, 12, 780170) My life is in the hands of God.
('57', 441, 6, 13, 780202) Even if I wish to depart I cannot, and if I am to depart, even expert doctors will not be able to save me.
('57', 441, 6, 14, 780309) It will be a great thing if you bear witness to the fact that I died for truth.
('57', 441, 6, 15, 780389) It is not that the blot to remove which I have been fasting disfigures Hindu religion alone it disfigures the whole of India, because the entire country is witness to it.
('57', 441, 6, 16, 780560) Hence you should all pray that Gandhi’s pledge be fulfilled.
('57', 441, 6, 17, 780621) It is not as if the Hindus could not pray for Muslims and vice versa.
('57', 441, 6, 18, 780691) That sort of belief is hypocritical.

('57', 441, 11, 24, 780865) They should not take hasty steps on my account.
('57', 441, 11, 25, 780913) They should endorse only that which they feel is right.
('57', 441, 11, 26, 780969) They as well as I will be doing a wrong thing if later on I had to be persuaded to change my opinion.
('57', 441, 11, 27, 781071) We should not stand on our honour as far as our duty is concerned.
('57', 441, 11, 28, 781138) They should therefore cling to what is true, proper and just.
('57', 441, 11, 29, 781200) If in doing so my body falls, let it be so.
('57', 441, 11, 30, 781244) Everyone should do what he thinks is proper.
('57', 441, 11, 31, 781289) My stand is: either agree to referendum after five years or let me die.
('57', 441, 11, 32, 781361) Anyone who feels that this condition is not proper and is harmful should not accept it.

('57', 442, 2, 3, 781718) October 17, 1932
('57', 442, 3, 4, 781735) AMBEDKAR: I have not come to discuss untouchability but political matters.
('57', 442, 4, 5, 781810) GANDHIJI: That is true.
('57', 442, 4, 6, 781834) I cannot talk about it with you; even if you do I shall not be able to express an opinion—my mind does not work in that direction.
('57', 442, 5, 7, 781965) A. I have come here for this.
('57', 442, 5, 8, 781995) I want to request you to give up civil disobedience and to join the Round Table Conference.
('57', 442, 5, 9, 782087) The point is that if you do not come, we shall get nothing in England and everything will be upset.
('57', 442, 5, 10, 782187) People like Iqbal who are enemies of the country will come to the forefront.
('57', 442, 5, 11, 782264) We have to work any sort of constitution.
('57', 442, 5, 12, 782306) Hence though I am a small man, I request you to come.
('57', 442, 6, 13, 782360) G. If you elabroate your argument, I shall think over it.
('57', 442, 6, 14, 782418) I suggest you go and write about it at length in the newspapers.
('57', 442, 6, 15, 782483) I shall think over it.
('57', 442, 7, 16, 782506) A. It is not a thing that can be put down in writing.
('57', 442, 7, 17, 782560) In it I shall have to say a lot that will hurt the Muslims and I cannot say that publicly.
('57', 442, 7, 18, 782651) But I shall write anonymously or have someone write in a different way.
('57', 442, 7, 19, 782723) Please have a look at it and, taking it to be mine, think over it.
('57', 442, 8, 20, 782790) G. It will be good if you write under your own name.
('57', 442, 8, 21, 782843) But of course you may do as you wish.
('57', 442, 9, 22, 782881) A. I must honestly say that I have no interest in the temples being thrown open, common dinners and the like, becuase we suffer thereby.
('57', 442, 9, 23, 783018) My people have to put up with beatings and bitterness increases.
('57', 442, 9, 24, 783083) After the common dinner at Vile Parle, the Maratha workers went on strike.
('57', 442, 9, 25, 783158) If the caste Hindus had the strength they would have engaged untouchables as servants.
('57', 442, 9, 26, 783245) But that has not been so.
('57', 442, 9, 27, 783271) Hence I do not feel interested in the thing.
('57', 442, 9, 28, 783316) I only want that social and economic hardships should end.
('57', 442, 10, 29, 783375) G. Give examples.
('57', 442, 11, 30, 783393) A. The untouchables do not get houses to live in; they continue to suffer injustice and oppression.
('57', 442, 11, 31, 783493) In one case, an untouchable was accused of having murdered a Maratha.
('57', 442, 11, 32, 783563) I could have taken the case to Sessions and got him acquitted, but the magistrate changed the charge of murder to one of grievous injury.
('57', 442, 11, 33, 783701) Now he will receive some punishment.
('57', 442, 11, 34, 783738) You may not know what even I have to face.
('57', 442, 11, 35, 783781) I do not get any other place to live in Bombay except the Port Trust chawl.
('57', 442, 11, 36, 783857) In my village, I have to stay in the midst of the Mahars.
('57', 442, 11, 37, 783915) In Poona, all others stay with their friends.
('57', 442, 11, 38, 783961) I have to stay at the National Hotel and have to spend Rs. 7 and transport fare.
('57', 442, 12, 39, 784042) G. Servants of India?
('57', 442, 13, 40, 784064) A. Yes, I can perhaps stay there.
('57', 442, 13, 41, 784098) But only perhaps.
('57', 442, 13, 42, 784116) You will know if you ask Vaze.
('57', 442, 13, 43, 784147) Once Vaze’s servant insulted me in his presence.
('57', 442, 13, 44, 784196) I want to do away with all these hardships.

('57', 443, 1, 2, 784282) G. I am at one with you.
('57', 443, 1, 3, 784307) You ought to know that my fast has not ended yet, it is still on.
('57', 443, 1, 4, 784373) To correct the agreement was a minor thing.
('57', 443, 1, 5, 784417) The main thing still remains to be done.
('57', 443, 1, 6, 784458) I am ready to give my life for it.
('57', 443, 1, 7, 784493) All the injustices you mention ought to end.
('57', 443, 2, 8, 784538) A. Birla said that I should be taken on the Committee for the Abolition of Untouchability.
('57', 443, 2, 9, 784629) I declined to join, because what can I alone do?
('57', 443, 2, 10, 784678) I would have to agree to the work of abolishing untouchability being done in accordance with your wishes.
('57', 443, 2, 11, 784784) If we are in a majority we can get the reforms that we wish brought about.
('57', 443, 2, 12, 784859) You wish that temples should be erected or wells should be dug.
('57', 443, 2, 13, 784923) We might feel that that would be a waste of money, that there should be another way out for it.
('57', 443, 3, 14, 785019) G. I understand your point of view, and I shall keep it in mind and shall see what can be done.

('57', 445, 26, 27, 789223) GANDHIJI : The Zamorin does not say that it is impossible to throw open the temple but he goes on pointing out his difficulties.
('57', 445, 26, 28, 789352) If he fails in his efforts Kelappan and I have to resort to fast unless I see some flaw in the claim advanced.
('57', 445, 26, 29, 789463) In fact there is no flaw in it.
('57', 445, 26, 30, 789495) There are difficulties in the way of the Zamorin but they are not such that they cannot be got over.
('57', 445, 26, 31, 789596) The real test is whether the sanatanists, those who have the privilege of entering the temple, have any objection to untouchables entering the temple.
('57', 445, 26, 32, 789747) All the information I have received shows that the majority of the temple goers have no objection.
('57', 445, 26, 33, 789846) The whole movement is based on the belief that the temple

('57', 446, 1, 2, 790138) goers, i.e., sanatanists are prepared for the reform.
('57', 446, 1, 3, 790192) Our fast would be premature if they are not prepared for the reform.
('57', 446, 2, 4, 790261) Question : There won’t be any fast if the difficulties regarding the opening of these temples are removed.
('57', 446, 2, 5, 790368) Isn’t that so?
('57', 446, 3, 6, 790383) G. The proposed fast is above all for the opening of this temple.
('57', 446, 3, 7, 790449) To make it a test case Kelappan had concentrated all his efforts on this temple alone.
('57', 446, 3, 8, 790536) They have made their utmost effort to get the temple opened.
('57', 446, 3, 9, 790597) After I began my fast Kelappan also decided to follow me.
('57', 446, 3, 10, 790655) But he had not given due notice.
('57', 446, 3, 11, 790688) I pointed out this fault and advised him to postpone the fast.
('57', 446, 3, 12, 790751) He agreed to it.
('57', 446, 3, 13, 790768) Now therefore I am honour bound to fast with him.
('57', 446, 3, 14, 790818) This is the reason why we have concentrated our efforts on Guruvayur.
('57', 446, 4, 15, 790888) Q. The Zamorin says that thousands of people are willing to lay down their lives.
('57', 446, 5, 16, 790970) G. That statement of his is not true.
('57', 446, 5, 17, 791008) However, I won’t be worried if thousands of people who call themeslves sanatanists go on a fast.
('57', 446, 5, 18, 791105) Truth is more precious than thousands of lives.
('57', 446, 5, 19, 791153) I feel that a fast is a means to self purification and awakening the inner self.
('57', 446, 5, 20, 791234) It cannot be a means of coercion.
('57', 446, 6, 21, 791268) Q. Won’t this movement divide the Hindu community?
('57', 446, 6, 22, 791319) Won’t the sanatanists be separated from the rest of the Hindus?
('57', 446, 7, 23, 791383) G. I entertain no such fear.
('57', 446, 7, 24, 791412) Being a democrat, I would not oppose as I am doing now the movement known as the sanatanist movement if I am satisfied that it has the support of the majority.
('57', 446, 7, 25, 791572) The whole movement of eradication of untouchability rests on the belief that the opposition does not have a formidable support.
('57', 446, 7, 26, 791700) It is well known that it does not have any moral support.
('57', 446, 8, 27, 791758) Q. Don’t you feel that you would be more effective if you were outside?
('57', 446, 8, 28, 791830) Do you consider eradication of untouchability less important than civil disobedience?
('57', 446, 9, 29, 791916) G. I do not give anyone of them either less or more importance.
('57', 446, 9, 30, 791980) For me both are religious principles and so I cannot consider one inferior to the other.
('57', 446, 9, 31, 792069) Here I am talking about civil disobedience as a principle, not as a movement.
('57', 446, 9, 32, 792147) I cannot give any opinion on the civil disobedience that is going on the country.
('57', 446, 10, 33, 792229) Q. It seems that the movement is not as effective as it should be.
('57', 446, 11, 34, 792296) G. I cannot say that.
('57', 446, 11, 35, 792318) I am not in a position to say anything.
