('70', 0, 2, 3, 70) SEGAON, WARDHA, Octorber 21, 1936 MY DEAR REBEL, You have certainly provided me with excellent material for Harijan.
('70', 0, 2, 4, 187) 1 Mahadev will see your letter.
('70', 0, 2, 5, 219) I shall make judicious use of portions of it.
('70', 0, 2, 6, 265) You must then do a little propaganda work, even write to the papers and invite other women to do likewise.
('70', 0, 2, 7, 372) If you women would only realize your dignity and privilege, and make full use of it for mankind, you will make it much better than it is.
('70', 0, 2, 8, 510) But man has delighted in enslaving you and you have proved willing slaves till the slaves and the slave holders have become one in the crime of degrading humanity.
('70', 0, 2, 9, 674) My special function from childhood, you might say, has been to make woman realize her dignity.
('70', 0, 2, 10, 769) I was once slave holder myself but Ba proved an unwilling slave and thus opened my eyes to my mission.
('70', 0, 2, 11, 872) Her task was finished.
('70', 0, 2, 12, 895) Now I am in search of a woman who would realize her mission.
('70', 0, 2, 13, 956) Are you that woman, will you be one?
('70', 0, 2, 14, 993) If Shummy will be happy and healthy going to Europe and won’t go without you, why should you not accompany him?
('70', 0, 2, 15, 1105) No time for more.
('70', 0, 2, 16, 1123) Gave you a long letter yesterday.
('70', 0, 3, 17, 1157) TYRANT [PS.] Yes, you should write to Natesan without doubt.

('70', 0, 6, 22, 1334) LILA, I have been thinking of you, though I have been unable to wirte to you of late.
('70', 0, 6, 23, 1420) Are you aware, or aren’t you, that you have taken upon yourself a much greater burden by asking to be released from the conditions?
('70', 0, 6, 24, 1552) You do not intend to become a self indulgent person.

('70', 1, 6, 9, 2007) Rajkumari’s letter, which I send you, is for you to read.
('70', 1, 6, 10, 2065) It should be returned as I shall want it for Harijan.
('70', 1, 6, 11, 2119) Next week it is going to be a question what to write and what not to write.
('70', 1, 6, 12, 2195) Both the patients are fine— subnormal.
('70', 1, 6, 13, 2234) Mirabehn’s complaint has toned down today.

('70', 1, 11, 20, 2487) Take it for certain that you will be there.
('70', 1, 11, 21, 2531) The accompanying is for Raja 2. Write to S. saying that I have written to Raja.
('70', 1, 12, 22, 2611) I can’t see how I may write on Premchandji 3. If we suggest it to Viyogi Hari, he might draft a brief note.
('70', 1, 12, 23, 2719) We take no editorial notice of men of letters.
('70', 1, 12, 24, 2766) Lallubhai’s 4 case, however, deserves to be considered.
('70', 1, 12, 25, 2822) For my part, I propose to leave here at six o’clock.

('70', 2, 7, 13, 3713) There is no reason for Kamala to confine herself where she is.

('70', 3, 3, 4, 4412) AMTUL SALAAM, I got your letter just now.
('70', 3, 3, 5, 4454) I had Kanti’s letter expressing his happiness on the Rentia Baras Day.
('70', 3, 3, 6, 4525) It is not worth sending to you.
('70', 3, 3, 7, 4557) I don’t bother him since he has no time to spare.
('70', 3, 3, 8, 4607) It is good that you went to hospital.
('70', 3, 3, 9, 4645) Khurshedbehn had written to me.
('70', 3, 3, 10, 4677) I should of course be glad if you helped her.
('70', 3, 3, 11, 4723) I myself never undertake a pilgrimage.
('70', 3, 3, 12, 4762) There is so much hypocrisy prevailing in places of pilgrimage.
('70', 3, 3, 13, 4825) I know several persons who have been to Mecca Sharif.
('70', 3, 3, 14, 4879) I couldn’t see that they had regained health by going there.
('70', 3, 3, 15, 4940) But since you have the faith, why should I stop you?
('70', 3, 3, 16, 4993) By all means go, and return more firm of mind, healthier and (free from attachment).
('70', 3, 3, 17, 5078) What more need I say?
('70', 3, 3, 18, 5100) I am leaving for Kashi today.
('70', 3, 3, 19, 5130) I shall spend two days there and then a few hours in Rajkot.
('70', 3, 3, 20, 5191) I reach Ahmedabad on the 30th.

('70', 3, 7, 26, 5371) [Before October 24, 1936]
('70', 3, 8, 27, 5397) A friendly Englishman asked Gandhiji the other day a question which rather surprised me: “You are a Gujarati, you belong to Gujarat.
('70', 3, 8, 28, 5530) Why should you have selected a Marathi speaking part for your work and experiments?
('70', 3, 8, 29, 5614) And why Wardha of all places?” Gandhiji was no less surprised, but he calmly replied: I do not belong to Gujarat, I belong to the whole of India.
('70', 3, 8, 30, 5760) Wardha I selected because it afforded so many facilities for work.
('70', 3, 8, 31, 5827) There is Jamnalal Bajaj who is interested in my programme of work and my experiments, and he gave me his valuable garden and his garden house for the Village Industries Association of which I made Wardha the headquarters.

('70', 4, 1, 2, 6164) 9. ALL ROUND RISE?
('70', 4, 2, 3, 6183) Sri Krishnadas Gandhi of Maharashtra Charkha Sangh informs me that the rise in the spinners’ wage has necessitated a rise in the twisters’ wage.
('70', 4, 2, 4, 6328) Experiments are therefore now being made how without raising the price of khadi the efficiency of the twister can be raised so as to enable her to make 3 as per day.
('70', 4, 2, 5, 6494) He has therefore started using the double spindle Magan Rentiyo for the purpose.
('70', 4, 2, 6, 6575) If all the workers engaged in khadi production will work with the spirit that fires Krishnadas Gandhi and a few such workers, we shall attain the ideal rise in wages in all the departments of khadi without putting an undue strain upon the consumers purse.
('70', 4, 2, 7, 6831) And if we succeed in giving the full wage to all the khadi artisans, we shoud have no difficulty in reaching the level for all other village industries.
('70', 4, 2, 8, 6984) What is needed is a scientific spirit that will take nothing for granted, that will brook no laziness of body or mind, that will have an undying faith in its mission.
('70', 4, 2, 9, 7151) All work is dead without faith.

('70', 4, 5, 12, 7218) Those who are engaged in saving the cow from the swift destruction that awaits her if measures are not taken betimes to save her, are often confronted with the question whether, apart 1 from the religious sentiment, the buffalo is not the cheaper animal to keep.
('70', 4, 5, 13, 7481) As a layman I have always hazarded the opinion that the cow is the cheaper to keep, at any rate in the long run, that it is impossible to save the two animals, and that if we would but concentrate attention on saving the cow, the buffalo will take care of herself.
('70', 4, 5, 14, 7746) But if the cow goes, the buffalo will never be able to take the cow’s place and the struggling, starving farmer will have in the deprivation of the cow and her male progeny a handicap that will leave him prostrate.
('70', 4, 5, 15, 7961) Those who are interested in this important problem will get some help form the following opinion 2 of Sardar Datar Singh M.D.D.(Eng.) of the Montgomery Dairy Farm sent to me by a friend.

('70', 5, 6, 19, 9061) I have read your letters.

('70', 5, 6, 21, 9138) Let us see what happens.

('70', 5, 6, 25, 9309) But the expenses for bringing them will have to be borne by you.
('70', 5, 6, 26, 9374) It has been decided not to spend more than Rs.5,000 for the Exhibition this time and so all who come will meet their own expenses.
('70', 5, 6, 27, 9505) The Committee will bear the expenses of their lodging and boarding.
('70', 5, 6, 28, 9573) If there is any profit after these expenses are met, it will be distributed among those who would have incurred the expenses.
('70', 5, 6, 29, 9699) If you bring any tools or have them made, I shall arrange for thier sale up to Rs. 200 at a profit of 20 per cent over their cost price.
('70', 5, 6, 30, 9836) This would give you a net profit of Rs. 40. I am interested in testing the strength of the Gandhi tools.

('70', 6, 9, 17, 10903) October 25, 1936 The temple contains no image of any God or Goddess.
('70', 6, 9, 18, 10972) It has only a relief map of India made of marble stone in it.
('70', 6, 9, 19, 11034) I hope this temple, which will serve as a cosmopolitan platform for people of all religions, castes and creeds including Harijans, will go a great way in promoting religious unity, peace and love in the country.
('70', 6, 10, 20, 11246) I can hardly express my sentiments in declaring open this shrine.
('70', 6, 10, 21, 11312) I have left Segaon, and my dear patients and my work in the village, to come to Kashi in obedience to the irresistible call of love— love which, in Saint Mirabai’s language, is as soft and fragile as a
('70', 6, 11, 22, 11514) 1 Vide “ Silk and Cotton”, 7 11 1936 2 Gandhiji performed the opening ceremony in the afternoon before a vast gathering of over 25,000 people which included Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Parsis, Jains , Buddhists and Harijans from all parts of the country.

('70', 7, 0, 1, 11812) 8 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('70', 7, 1, 2, 11852) weak thread, but as strong as life itself.
('70', 7, 1, 3, 11895) It draws men together from thousands of miles, and I could not possibly resist Shivprasad’s affection.
('70', 7, 1, 4, 11998) I am in no way worthy of opening the shrine, but Shivprasad’s affection has made me forget my limitations.
('70', 7, 1, 5, 12105) 1 Babu Shivprasad lives on the bank of the Ganga which purifies his body, but even in his heart flows another Ganga—that of emotion and imagination.
('70', 7, 1, 6, 12254) One can fly on the wings of emotion and imagination right up to Heaven, and also sink to hell when they are unhealthy.
('70', 7, 1, 7, 12373) Shivprasad’s pure and noble imagination has prompted him to think of the shrine of Mother India and to dedicate a portion of his wealth to its making.
('70', 7, 1, 8, 12524) In the temple about to be opened he has given a concrete shape to his imagination which he conceived in Prof.
('70', 7, 1, 9, 12634) Karve’s Home for Widows 2. He rallied craftsmen, sculptors and engineers who could appreciate his sentiment.
('70', 7, 1, 10, 12743) There was a time when he had despaired of life, but God has enabled him to live to see his dream take shape.
('70', 7, 2, 11, 12852) As I was asked to perform the opening 4 ceremony in the morning, and as I listened to the chanting of the Vedic mantras, I thought of a verse in our morning prayer which we have been repeating now for 20 years: ‘Mother Earth, Spouse of Vishnu, ocean clad and mountain breasted, I bow to Thee.
('70', 7, 2, 12, 13145) Forgive me the touch of my feet.’ It is this Mother Earth to the service and devotion of which we are dedicating ourselves today.
('70', 7, 2, 13, 13275) The Mother who gave us birth was bound to die some day; not so the Universal Mother who bears and sustains us.
('70', 7, 2, 14, 13386) She must die some day, but when she passed away she would take all her children also along with her.
('70', 7, 2, 15, 13487) She therefore demands a life long dedication.
('70', 7, 2, 16, 13533) Shivprasad had dedicated this shrine for the worship by all, irrespective of creed.
('70', 7, 2, 17, 13617) He had imposed no conditions whatsoever.
('70', 7, 2, 18, 13658) Everyone who loved Mother India was welcome to the shrine to offer his or her worship according to his or her light and capacity.
('70', 7, 2, 19, 13788) Therefore, I could not resist Shivprasad’s affectionate summons.

('70', 8, 4, 7, 14783) October 25, 1936
('70', 8, 5, 8, 14800) It strikes me as peculiarly inappropriate to ask a man like me to make this presentation 1. I am wholly unfit for the task 2. I am neither a Hindi scholar nor a poet.
('70', 8, 5, 9, 14967) I do not even like celebrating jubilees of great or small people.
('70', 8, 5, 10, 15033) If we must celebrate somebody’s jubilee we should do so when he is no more among us.
('70', 8, 5, 11, 15118) I regard it as peculiarly inappropriate if not impertinent for people to present great men with a book of what I should call certificates of merit.
('70', 8, 5, 12, 15266) I therefore refused to contribute anything to the Commemoration Volume; but the word Mahatma covers a multitude of disqualifications and so, I suppose, I was asked to present the Volume.
('70', 8, 5, 13, 15453) It is my innermost conviction that a man cannot be called a poet or a Mahatma or an avatar so long as he is alive 3. Ramchandraji was not considered an avatar during his lifetime.
('70', 8, 5, 14, 15633) Tulsidas’s birth anniversary was not celebrated when he was living.
('70', 8, 5, 15, 15701) It is we who have made them avatars.
('70', 8, 5, 16, 15738) After all the Gita maxim, “To work thou hast the right, not to the fruit thereof”, applies peculiarly to poets and Mahatmas.
('70', 8, 5, 17, 15863) I should therefore have a bone to pick with Maithilisharanji if he were to believe that he was a great poet of India.
('70', 8, 6, 18, 15981) So this anniversary should have been celebrated when the Poet was no more.
('70', 8, 6, 19, 16056) People would have then known that something was being done for honouring him.
('70', 8, 6, 20, 16134) You will please forgive me.

('70', 9, 1, 3, 16540) Such a poet’s work does not call for an expression of opinions.
('70', 9, 1, 4, 16604) If ever I had delivered myself of an opinion on Gurudev or Malaviyaji or Dwivediji, it was always under pressure.
('70', 9, 1, 5, 16718) If you ask me, I have never felt like writing about great men.
('70', 9, 1, 6, 16781) The fact that I did so on former occasions is no reason why I should repeat the mistake.
('70', 9, 1, 7, 16870) If you also press me I might write something for you too, but not willingly.
('70', 9, 1, 8, 16947) I know Maithilisharanji very well.
('70', 9, 1, 9, 16982) Even if I refused to write about him he would not misunderstand me.
('70', 9, 1, 10, 17050) I had the honour of having his hospitality in Chirgaon.
('70', 9, 1, 11, 17106) A poet writes under inspiration and not to the dictation of any one.
('70', 9, 1, 12, 17175) He therefore does not write for applause.
('70', 9, 1, 13, 17217) His work is its own joy and compensation.

('70', 11, 3, 5, 19318) You need not have included yourselves among those to whom my appeal for sparing me was addressed.
('70', 11, 3, 6, 19416) Letters from informal friends and co workers like you living in distant lands are always welcome.
('70', 11, 3, 7, 19514) That you cannot come again to India owing to your duty keeping you there is no cause for regret.
('70', 11, 3, 8, 19611) Where hearts are one, physical separation is of no moment.
('70', 11, 3, 9, 19670) Truth and ahimsa are truer than many so called scientific facts.
('70', 11, 3, 10, 19735) Only they are difficult to put into practice.

('70', 12, 3, 6, 20944) Now I have read it carefully.
('70', 12, 3, 7, 20974) There is one very big historical error in it.
('70', 12, 3, 8, 21020) You will evidently think that the vast majority of Mussalmans are immigrants and their descendants.
('70', 12, 3, 9, 21120) The truth is just the opposite.
('70', 12, 3, 10, 21152) The vast majority are converts and their descendants and therefore inheritors of the Vedic civilization and culture.
('70', 12, 3, 11, 21269) And why should not the immigrants take pride in the achievements of the ancestors of the original inhabitants?
('70', 12, 3, 12, 21380) Your note contains several other glaring inaccuracies and faulty conclusions or inferences.
('70', 12, 3, 13, 21472) I detect much haste in its preparation.
('70', 12, 3, 14, 21512) I wish I had time to point out these.
('70', 12, 3, 15, 21550) But I have no time.
('70', 12, 3, 16, 21570) You should reread your note and perhaps you will detect some errors yourself.
('70', 12, 3, 17, 21648) To conclude, I should even now refuse to go to heaven without Mussalmans nor has my effort for unity abated in any way.
('70', 12, 3, 18, 21768) Only my method is different but deeper and more substantial.

('70', 13, 7, 13, 22890) RAJKOT, October 29, 1936
('70', 13, 8, 14, 22915) Gandhiji said to them that in view of cases of impurity of Harijan workers having come to his notice, he had been confirmed in his conviction that no Harijan ashrams should look to the central office for any financial help; that they may be, if they would; under the discipline and control of the Central Body; and that the impurity had so far alarmed him that he had not the courage to ask individuals to support these institutions financially.
('70', 13, 8, 15, 23361) It was the clearest duty of those in charge of these institutions to put the public at ease about the purity of the institutions before they approached them for financial help.
('70', 13, 9, 16, 23538) Harijan, 7 11 1936

('70', 13, 10, 19, 23633) This was evidently written the next day.
('70', 13, 10, 20, 23674) 2 This and the following two items have been extracted from Mahadev Desai’s “Weekly Letter”

('70', 14, 2, 3, 23867) October 30, 1936
('70', 14, 3, 4, 23884) I ought not to have been asked to speak on this occasion, inasmuch as my presence is enough to show that the institution has my blessings.
('70', 14, 3, 5, 24023) Besides, I already blessed the institution when I came here last year 2 to lay the foundation stone.
('70', 14, 3, 6, 24124) But now that I have been asked to speak, let me say that my blessings are conditional.
('70', 14, 3, 7, 24211) I should like to impress on those in charge of this institution, the teachers and the girls that the institution will not last without a moral foundation.
('70', 14, 3, 8, 24366) The workers should all be selfless workers and the education imparted here should be true education, that is to say, which draws out the best in the character of the taught.
('70', 14, 3, 9, 24540) Every one of us has good inherent in the soul, it needs to be drawn out by the teachers, and only those teachers can perform this sacred function whose own character is unsullied, who are always ready to learn and to grow from perfection to perfection.
('70', 14, 3, 10, 24793) The girls also will have to be receptive, they will not think of showing themselves off but of enabling their teachers to draw out the best in themselves.
('70', 14, 3, 11, 24948) I have had bitter experience of institutions of this character and therefore hesitate to bless newly opened institutions.
('70', 14, 3, 12, 25070) I am even doubtful about the teachers needing my blessings.
('70', 14, 3, 13, 25130) Some of them, I dare say, think of me a back number, not in touch with the spirit of the age and modern tendencies and not at all competent to speak to the modern youth.
('70', 14, 3, 14, 25300) Well, let those who think like that reject what I have said.

('70', 14, 7, 18, 25428) The girls of the institution 3 gathered in the afternoon to give Gandhiji their yarn spun on the occasion of his birthday.
('70', 14, 7, 19, 25551) There were boys, too, of the Vallabh Vidyalaya of Bochasan.
('70', 14, 7, 20, 25611) The girls gave 122,475 yards of yarn but, what is more, 60 of them took pledge to spin 100,000 yards during the year for their own clothing needs.

('70', 15, 1, 2, 25943) [GANDHIJI:] You know that Seth Jamnalal Bajaj has opened your hostel today.
('70', 15, 1, 3, 26019) You must try to be worthy of that good man.

('70', 15, 2, 5, 26103) [GIRLS:] Oh, yes.
('70', 15, 2, 6, 26121) No ‘oh, yes’ but ‘yes, please’.

('70', 15, 3, 8, 26194) But if he is a good man, what about the rest?

('70', 15, 6, 15, 26343) Well, then, now tell me if any of you tell lies.
('70', 15, 7, 16, 26392) ‘We do,’ said some of them.
('70', 15, 7, 17, 26420) Always or on occasions?
('70', 15, 8, 18, 26444) On certain occasions.
('70', 15, 8, 19, 26466) And don’t you quarrel?
('70', 15, 9, 20, 26489) Always?
('70', 15, 10, 21, 26497) ‘Yes’, which was drowned in hearty laughter.
('70', 15, 10, 22, 26542) Well, but I must say that you are good, because you are ready to confess that you sometimes tell lies and quarrel amongst yourselves.
('70', 15, 10, 23, 26676) And the rest of us are also good only in that sense and no other.
('70', 15, 10, 24, 26742) But what about those who go about saying that everyone must tell the truth but who, themselves never do so?
('70', 15, 11, 25, 26850) They are hypocrites.
('70', 15, 11, 26, 26871) That’s perfect.
('70', 15, 11, 27, 26887) Let us never be hypocrites.
('70', 15, 11, 28, 26915) Now, one more question.
('70', 15, 11, 29, 26939) You have taken a pledge to spin 100,000 yards during the year.
('70', 15, 11, 30, 27002) What if you break the pledge?
('70', 15, 12, 31, 27032) ‘No fear,’ they emphatically protested.
('70', 15, 12, 32, 27072) But if you do?
('70', 15, 13, 33, 27087) ‘We know we will not,” they rejoined with even greater emphasis.
('70', 15, 13, 34, 27152) But supposing you do?
('70', 15, 14, 35, 27174) (One voice) ‘Fasting !’ Who is to fast?
('70', 15, 14, 36, 27214) I or you?
('70', 15, 15, 37, 27224) We of course.
('70', 16, 0, 1, 27238) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 17
('70', 16, 1, 2, 27285) Fasting on milk and fruit?
('70', 16, 2, 3, 27312) No, Sir, We shall take only water.
('70', 16, 2, 4, 27347) But how many days will you fast?
('70', 16, 3, 5, 27380) So long as we do not finish our promised quota.
('70', 16, 3, 6, 27428) Splendid.
('70', 16, 3, 7, 27438) But know that there are reporters here who will publish this talk of ours and you will have to rue it if you fail.
('70', 16, 4, 8, 27553) Then came the turn of Vallabh Vidyalaya boys—boys of the Dharala community who are being taught and given their board and lodging free.
('70', 16, 4, 9, 27689) The teacher presented to Gandhiji cloth woven out of the yarn spun from slivers carded on the 12th of October, from cotton purchased out of the wages they had earned from carding.
('70', 16, 4, 10, 27869) The teacher said that the boys did cleaning and sweeping of the streets as well.
('70', 16, 4, 11, 27950) Every day?
('70', 16, 5, 12, 27961) No, we did so on Gandhiji’s birthday.
('70', 16, 5, 13, 27999) Well, I tell you, if you do it every day you will make Bochasan a model village from the standpoint of sanitation and you may some day be Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
('70', 16, 5, 14, 28163) Even if you fail to be Sardar Vallabhbhai, you will have done something good.
('70', 16, 5, 15, 28241) But you may take it from me that if you do not do this street cleaning, you will never be Sardar Vallabhbhai.
('70', 16, 6, 16, 28351) But,’said one of the boys, ‘ours is a bad village.
('70', 16, 6, 17, 28402) It does not deserve these heroic measures.
('70', 16, 6, 18, 28445) We may clean the streets, but they will go on spoiling them.’ Now, now, don’t say so.
('70', 16, 6, 19, 28531) All villages are like that, and it is our duty to persevere the more, the more they persist in defiling the streets.
('70', 16, 6, 20, 28648) And you must not forget that you belong to the village.

('70', 17, 2, 3, 29177) Let not the word Bhangi frighten any reader as it does many.
('70', 17, 2, 4, 29238) [The] Bhangi is probably the most useful member of society.
('70', 17, 2, 5, 29298) Its health depends more upon proper sanitation than perhaps on proper food.
('70', 17, 2, 6, 29374) Needless to say I am not thinking of the Bhangi caste.
('70', 17, 2, 7, 29429) I am thinking purely of the occupation that the word ‘Bhangi’ connotes.
('70', 17, 2, 8, 29501) I regard the scavenger’s or the cleaner’s as a noble ‘profession’, nobler than the professions known as ‘honourable’.
('70', 17, 2, 9, 29619) They may easily become dishonourable; this never can.
('70', 17, 2, 10, 29673) Well, Shri Appa Patwardhan who is an M.A. has become commander of a corps of volunteer Bhangis which he is trying to form for attending to the sanitation of the Congress camp at Faizpur.
('70', 17, 2, 11, 29860) The issue before the Reception Committee was whether to employ professional Bhangis or to have the sanitation attended to by volunteers.
('70', 17, 2, 12, 29997) Someone pointed out that at the previous Congress the work was done by the town Bhangis.
('70', 17, 2, 13, 30086) But the volunteer scheme won the day.
('70', 17, 2, 14, 30124) The task could not have been allotted to fitter hands.
('70', 17, 2, 15, 30179) Appasaheb has qualified himself for it by long previous training and, what is more, by his love of the most despised member of society.
('70', 17, 2, 16, 30315) His love has not been purely sentimental.
('70', 17, 2, 17, 30357) He has done the work of sanitation side by side with Bhangis, and he knows that proper scavenging is as much a science as any other.
('70', 17, 2, 18, 30490) He has invited applications for the free services of two hundred persons not under 18 years of age for the work.
('70', 17, 2, 19, 30603) They must be willing and ready to attend to the cleaning of latrines and the whole camp while the Congress work lasts.
('70', 17, 2, 20, 30722) They must be zealous youths who won’t neglect the duty entrusted to them for the sake of seeing the tamasha or the Congress delegates at work.
('70', 17, 2, 21, 30865) Theirs will be the privilege of making the work of the delegates possible by attending to their sanitary comforts.
('70', 17, 2, 22, 30980) Maharashtra is a bee hive of good hardy workers.
('70', 17, 2, 23, 31029) It should not be difficult for the province to supply two hundred good and true young men to do the work.
('70', 17, 2, 24, 31135) Not that young men from other provinces may not apply.
('70', 17, 2, 25, 31190) But for the sake of economy, if nothing more, it is better to have young men from the province and, better still, the taluq or the district in which the Congress is held.

('70', 18, 0, 1, 31381) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 19
('70', 18, 1, 2, 31428) 30. WHOSE IS THE HUMILIATION?
('70', 18, 2, 3, 31458) From a long letter of a worker among Harijans I take the following paragraph:
('70', 18, 3, 4, 31536) There is a growing discontent on the part of educated Harijans to call themselves Hindus.
('70', 18, 3, 5, 31626) Because if they say they are Hindus, they have to disclose their caste also, and the inferiority complex makes this unpleasant.
('70', 18, 3, 6, 31754) They would rather call themselves Christians than undergo humiliation by calling themselves Hindus.
('70', 18, 3, 7, 31854) Why may we not then ask them to become Sikhs or Buddhists and end the humiliation?
('70', 18, 3, 8, 31937) For Sikhs and Buddhists are as good as Hindus.
('70', 18, 3, 9, 31984) The correspondent gives up his case when he says that Sikhs and Buddhists are as good as Hindus.
('70', 18, 3, 10, 32081) For if that is so, there is no occasion to prompt Harijans or anyone else in the direction.
('70', 18, 3, 11, 32173) Any Hindu is free to call himself a follower of any one of the innumerable Hindu sects and yet remain Hindu.
('70', 18, 3, 12, 32282) And why should a Hindu disclose his caste if he does not want to or if he has renounced caste?
('70', 18, 3, 13, 32377) Many Hindus do not believe in caste.
('70', 18, 3, 14, 32414) I have endeavoured to show that caste is no part of Hinduism.
('70', 18, 3, 15, 32476) Varna is not caste, it is class.
('70', 18, 3, 16, 32509) A man may call himself a Brahmin, i.e., a teacher of religion, if he is one in fact; or a Kshatriya, i.e., a soldier, if he is one; or a Vaishya, i.e., a merchant or a farmer, if he is that; or a Shudra, i.e., an employee, if he is one.
('70', 18, 3, 17, 32746) These divisions are not castes but classes and have reference to callings.
('70', 18, 3, 18, 32821) There is no such class as untouchable.
('70', 18, 3, 19, 32860) Hence an untouchable is not bound to say he is one.
('70', 18, 3, 20, 32912) He may say if he wishes that Hindu society has regarded him as such but he does not recognize that distinction.
('70', 18, 3, 21, 33024) I may say that though I have been classified by Hindu society as belonging to the Bania caste, I am not that, as I do not believe in caste, but that if I must call myself anything more than mere Hindu, I am a Harijan by choice, having made, so far as in me lies, common cause with Harijans.
('70', 18, 3, 22, 33315) And why is there any humiliation in a Harijan disclosing his classification made by Hindu Society?
('70', 18, 3, 23, 33414) Surely the humiliation is of the society that reduces its members to the condition of helots, consigned to ghettos and shunned by society.
('70', 18, 3, 24, 33553) The very education of the Harijan should make him proud of the fact that he can truthfully call himself a Hindu even though so called higher castes have denied their religion in their lives and persecuted him in a manner beyond description.
('70', 18, 3, 25, 33794) If untouchability is destroyed root and branch and Hinduism lives, the future historian will assign the place of honour to Harijans who will have stood by their faith in spite of heartless persecution by their
('70', 19, 0, 1, 34004) 20 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('70', 19, 1, 2, 34045) fellows.
('70', 19, 1, 3, 34054) Each time, therefore, a Harijan has to say what he is classed as in Hindu society, the humiliation is not his but of his persecutors—the so called caste Hindus.
('70', 19, 2, 4, 34215) Harijan, 31 10 1936
('70', 19, 3, 5, 34235) 31. SPEECH AT LABOURERS’ MEETING, AHMEDABAD
('70', 19, 4, 6, 34279) October 31, 1936 In 1918 some workers had become indifferent and had also weakened.
('70', 19, 4, 7, 34363) To carry on a strike for twenty one days—remaining peaceful, not even throwing a little stone at anyone—is a hard test for anyone.
('70', 19, 4, 8, 34494) You passed through the test lasting 21 days.
('70', 19, 4, 9, 34539) Then you weakened somewhat.
('70', 19, 4, 10, 34567) Do you know what I had to do then and what the results were?
('70', 19, 4, 11, 34628) For 21 days you carried the banner on which were written the words” Unbreakable Vow”.
('70', 19, 4, 12, 34714) Every day I asked you to remember God and do everything with Him as your witness; otherwise the time would have come for a person like me to die.
('70', 19, 4, 13, 34860) As on the banner, so in the heart, “Unbreakable Vow” was written.
('70', 19, 4, 14, 34926) You had all lost heart but you played your part well.
('70', 19, 4, 15, 34980) Anyone who wishes to keep a pledge should take it only after due deliberation and recognizing his limitations.
('70', 19, 4, 16, 35091) One should know one’s own capacity and, as the saying goes, “You should stretch yourself according to the length of your bedspread.” Do I need to explain this to labourers?
('70', 19, 4, 17, 35264) For you always huddle up when you go to sleep.
('70', 19, 4, 18, 35311) Everyone should have a seven foot long bed; the labourer’s may well be made of coir strings and the rich man’s have silk webbing.
('70', 19, 4, 19, 35441) The rich may have a painted cot and yours may be [made of] babul wood, but everyone needs to stretch himself full length while sleeping.
('70', 19, 4, 20, 35578) I can see that this is not the case today.
('70', 19, 4, 21, 35621) Where is the room in your house for such a bed?
('70', 19, 4, 22, 35669) Some of you may have it, but the majority do not.
('70', 19, 4, 23, 35719) And, moreover, even if there is room for one such bed, the houses are not big enough to hold beds for your mother, wife, children, sister, and so on.
('70', 19, 4, 24, 35869) You live in hovels.
('70', 19, 4, 25, 35889) You have always to live huddled up as one does when shivering with cold.
('70', 19, 4, 26, 35962) You have not room enough even to stretch your legs.
('70', 19, 4, 27, 36014) At present this is the case everywhere.
('70', 19, 4, 28, 36054) Here too we are able to huddle up.
('70', 19, 4, 29, 36089) We do not have the strength to soar high into the skies.
('70', 19, 4, 30, 36146) Means have been invented for killing thousands of people with an explosion from the sky, but I do not want such power.
('70', 19, 4, 31, 36265) We should not even wish for it.
('70', 19, 4, 32, 36297) Even if it were possible to acquire the strength to destroy everything by a whiff, I
('70', 20, 0, 1, 36382) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 21
('70', 20, 1, 2, 36429) would refuse such strength.
('70', 20, 1, 3, 36457) But we should have the strength to keep a pledge, if we have taken one.
('70', 20, 1, 4, 36529) It is enough if we secure this strength.
('70', 20, 1, 5, 36570) We are all children of the earth and it is only if we keep our vows that we can live on this earth preserving our self respect.
('70', 20, 1, 6, 36698) You had for twenty years that capacity to keep your vow.
('70', 20, 1, 7, 36755) If tomorrow you lose this capacity which is your capital, you shall have lost your twenty years’ earnings.
('70', 20, 1, 8, 36862) It would be an asset if you could keep it unto death; otherwise all your achievements will come to nothing.
('70', 20, 1, 9, 36970) Today there are multi millionaires who become insolvent and take poison to end their lives.
('70', 20, 1, 10, 37062) Isn’t that so?
('70', 20, 1, 11, 37077) A vow is worth more than a hundred millions.
('70', 20, 1, 12, 37122) Its value can never be measured.
('70', 20, 1, 13, 37155) You treasured that capital for twenty years.
('70', 20, 1, 14, 37200) With the interest on it, it must have now doubled or trebled itself.
('70', 20, 1, 15, 37269) We, however, cannot live on interest.
('70', 20, 1, 16, 37307) We should be satisfied with what we have.
('70', 20, 1, 17, 37349) It is enough that our principle remains intact.
('70', 20, 1, 18, 37397) However, when this capital is lost you will become bankrupt.
('70', 20, 2, 19, 37458) The question facing you seems to be this: whether you have grown in strength or the mill owners.
('70', 20, 2, 20, 37555) If the mill owners close the doors against arbitration, you may have to resort to a strike.
('70', 20, 2, 21, 37647) They may want to try your strength.
('70', 20, 2, 22, 37683) Now I should like to suggest to the mill owners that if you grow in strength, they have nothing to be afraid of.
('70', 20, 2, 23, 37796) If they grow in strength you have everything to be afraid of.
('70', 20, 2, 24, 37858) But let us see what differentiates us from the mill owners.
('70', 20, 2, 25, 37918) Their strength lies in their wealth.Ours in our capacity to work.
('70', 20, 2, 26, 37984) Whereas they have the strength of money we have the strength of labour.
('70', 20, 2, 27, 38056) They depend upon their money, we upon our labour.
('70', 20, 2, 28, 38106) If labour did not co operate with capital, not a single mill could function.
('70', 20, 2, 29, 38183) If you and I do not work in their mills, your brothers will go and work there.
('70', 20, 2, 30, 38262) They will be able to procure workers with the help of money, threats, coercion or force.
('70', 20, 2, 31, 38351) But the co operation of labour will have to be secured.
('70', 20, 2, 32, 38407) Otherwise their mills will come to a standstill.
('70', 20, 2, 33, 38456) It is labour that holds the key.
('70', 20, 2, 34, 38489) The labour union may not have it but you, the labourers do have it.
('70', 20, 2, 35, 38557) Although there may be crores of you, what could you do if you had no capital?
('70', 20, 2, 36, 38635) What could you achieve if you had crores of rupees but not the talent to use them?
('70', 20, 2, 37, 38718) You will also need people to manage these mills.
('70', 20, 2, 38, 38767) I should not be able to run the industry even if someone gave me a crore of rupees.
('70', 20, 2, 39, 38851) I would know how to use the sum for Harijan work or for producing khadi.
('70', 20, 2, 40, 38924) But I cannot run a model mill.
('70', 20, 3, 41, 38955) 1 The paragraph that follows is from Mahadev Desai’s “Weekly Letter” in Harijan
('70', 21, 0, 1, 39035) 22 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('70', 21, 1, 2, 39076) It may well happen that a mill owner might hand over a mill to me if I pleaded with him to do so.
('70', 21, 1, 3, 39174) But even if someone did it I would not have the capacity to run it.
('70', 21, 1, 4, 39242) I wish you to acquire this capacity some day.
('70', 21, 1, 5, 39288) But in twenty years you have not acquired it, and in another twenty you may not be able to do so.
('70', 21, 1, 6, 39386) It may well happen that one labourer may learn the trick and make the others his slaves.
('70', 21, 1, 7, 39475) But the working class as a whole does not have this ability today.
('70', 21, 1, 8, 39542) If you believe that you have now developed this capacity, you will no longer require a leader.
('70', 21, 1, 9, 39637) I do not think you have it.
('70', 21, 1, 10, 39665) And the day you do so, there will cease to be two isms.
('70', 21, 1, 11, 39721) If you have it today, you have become capitalists.
('70', 21, 1, 12, 39772) Capital and labour will become one when you become aware of your own capital.
('70', 21, 1, 13, 39850) I am imagining a time when we shall bring about such a situation through a vow and this would be done not by breaking the heads of capitalists.
('70', 21, 1, 14, 39994) Let those who preach class war say what they will.
('70', 21, 1, 15, 40045) If I appreciated what they said, I would become one of them.
('70', 21, 1, 16, 40106) However, even if I came to profess class wars I would while doing so have to bring in many of my fads such as non violence, truth and so on.
('70', 21, 1, 17, 40247) To me, of course, these are invaluable principles and not fads.
('70', 21, 1, 18, 40311) Even if we fight mill owners, we are not to bear them ill will.
('70', 21, 1, 19, 40375) If we fight them, we should do so in the same way as we would fight our father, mother, wife or children.
('70', 21, 1, 20, 40481) We should struggle against them in the same way and for the same reason, as lovingly and reluctantly and with as much respect and politeness as we do against our blood relations.
('70', 21, 1, 21, 40660) The lessons which you learnt twenty years ago have still to be kept in mind.
('70', 21, 1, 22, 40737) Mill owners belong to the opposite camp.
('70', 21, 1, 23, 40778) But we have to consider others besides them.
('70', 21, 1, 24, 40823) Those who are known to all as blacklegs are traitors.
('70', 21, 1, 25, 40877) Within no time they undo the labour of years.
('70', 21, 1, 26, 40923) Instead of fighting them, we should plead with them, reason with them.
('70', 21, 1, 27, 40994) It may well happen that they do not listen to you.
('70', 21, 1, 28, 41045) It is all right if they walk away after hearing you; it would be even better if they came over to your side, but even if they do not, we have to bear with them.
('70', 21, 1, 29, 41206) There is another union here.
('70', 21, 1, 30, 41235) It has sent me an open letter.
('70', 21, 1, 31, 41266) Its substance is that you should merge in that union.
('70', 21, 1, 32, 41320) Otherwise there will be two unions.
('70', 21, 1, 33, 41356) I agree that in a place like Ahmedabad there is no room for two unions.
('70', 21, 1, 34, 41428) It is easy to undo the work you have been doing for twenty years; it is not so easy to carry it on.
('70', 21, 1, 35, 41528) If you wish to undo it, the Sabarmati is handy.
('70', 21, 1, 36, 41576) It may be that one may become a president quicker in the new union, you may even achieve some success, but do not yield to that temptation.
('70', 21, 1, 37, 41716) The protagonists of class war may claim that co operation is harmful.
('70', 21, 1, 38, 41786) For us, co operation is the first lesson.
('70', 22, 0, 1, 41828) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 23
('70', 22, 1, 2, 41875) When non co operation with the Government was advocated it was not implied that there could be no co operation in future.
('70', 22, 1, 3, 41997) In fact non co operation with the Government was launched so that co operation could at last become possible.
('70', 22, 1, 4, 42107) The day the Government becomes the servant of the people we should certainly co operate with it.
('70', 22, 1, 5, 42204) Similarly, these people—mill owners—can become our friends, but that will be when they give up their ism.
('70', 22, 1, 6, 42310) My association with you is a lifelong one.
('70', 22, 1, 7, 42353) If unfortunately you have to non co operate, it should only be in order to return to co operation.
('70', 22, 1, 8, 42452) If we do not co operate, both the parties will suffer.
('70', 22, 1, 9, 42507) You will be put to hardship for nothing and the mill owners too will suffer loss.
('70', 22, 1, 10, 42589) It is my desire that Ahmedabad should become a thousand times greater than it is today and the prestige this city has today should be greatly multiplied.
('70', 22, 1, 11, 42743) It is a heterogeneous place.
('70', 22, 1, 12, 42772) It is my function to bring about harmony among its varied elements.
('70', 22, 1, 13, 42840) It is the function of us all.
('70', 22, 1, 14, 42870) It is not for us to accentuate distinctions; it could be the work of class war enthusiasts.
('70', 22, 1, 15, 42962) We should on our part plead with them to bear with a single union.
('70', 22, 1, 16, 43029) I am one of the arbitrators and as such I may not say anything regarding justice or injustice.
('70', 22, 1, 17, 43124) After all I am an optimist.
('70', 22, 1, 18, 43152) I hope you will not be obliged to resort to a strike.
('70', 22, 1, 19, 43206) 1 The mill owners have not thrown their reason into the Sabarmati that they would be prepared to fight it out.
('70', 22, 1, 20, 43317) If for twenty years they regarded this course of action as harmful, would it become all right overnight?
('70', 22, 1, 21, 43422) I shall strain every nerve to avert a crisis.
('70', 22, 1, 22, 43468) However, what shall I do if the strain tells on the nerves?
('70', 22, 1, 23, 43528) I shall then understand that God is going to give us a test.
('70', 22, 1, 24, 43589) God perhaps wants to see whether or not the labourers keep their vow.
('70', 22, 1, 25, 43659) Only then will it be known whether your pledge was a flute made of a carrot, which could be eaten if it did not work, or a real flute.
('70', 22, 1, 26, 43794) Will a drunkard, a gambler or a dissolute character be able to keep his vow?
('70', 22, 1, 27, 43871) We are after all your servants.
('70', 22, 1, 28, 43903) We shall suffer for your sake.
('70', 22, 1, 29, 43934) We shall receive blows along with you, if that becomes necessary.
('70', 22, 1, 30, 44000) However, it may happen that we shall be spared and you alone will be beaten.
('70', 22, 1, 31, 44077) If you are beaten, we will nurse you.
('70', 22, 1, 32, 44115) You yourselves will have to bear the final burden.
('70', 22, 1, 33, 44166) We are only going to help you when you bear that
('70', 22, 2, 34, 44215) 1 The Bombay Chronicle reprots here: “ He was optimistic.
('70', 22, 2, 35, 44273) He believed that they would not have to go on strike.
('70', 22, 2, 36, 44327) Sheth Kasturbhai Lalbhai, the President of the Mill owners’ Association, was going to see him today.”
('70', 23, 0, 1, 44429) 24 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('70', 23, 1, 2, 44470) burden.
('70', 23, 1, 3, 44478) Whatever you do, do it intelligently and not through blind faith.
('70', 23, 1, 4, 44544) I believed that the key to swaraj lay with the labourers; but I now feel that it is not with them alone.
('70', 23, 1, 5, 44649) Swaraj will not come so long as our poverty is not wiped out.
('70', 23, 1, 6, 44711) The magic cure for achieving this is in Segaon—in the villages.
('70', 23, 1, 7, 44775) It is a village of six hundred people.
('70', 23, 1, 8, 44814) Three out of every four persons there are Harijans.
('70', 23, 1, 9, 44866) It has no railway station.
('70', 23, 1, 10, 44893) I have settled there because I believe it is untouched and not for my own pleasure.
('70', 23, 1, 11, 44977) The happiness of the poor, of Daridranarayana, is all my pleasure.
('70', 23, 1, 12, 45044) They do not get even rotlo.
('70', 23, 1, 13, 45072) And if they do, it is of poor quality, unbuttered and savoured with dirty salt.
('70', 23, 1, 14, 45152) I can testify to this.
('70', 23, 1, 15, 45175) We must find out how we can rid them of thier misery.
('70', 23, 1, 16, 45229) How can it be done while sitting here?
('70', 23, 1, 17, 45268) You are in a much better position than they.
('70', 23, 1, 18, 45313) There are no chawls 1, no schools, no hospitals like yours.
('70', 23, 1, 19, 45373) Even for Mirabehn, no doctor would be available if we looked for one.
('70', 23, 1, 20, 45443) On both sides there would be patients suffering from infectious diseases, and we lying between them.
('70', 23, 1, 21, 45544) My faith, however, grows day after day.
('70', 23, 1, 22, 45584) The people of Segaon hold the key to your liberation.
('70', 23, 1, 23, 45638) You are well aware of your plight.
('70', 23, 1, 24, 45673) Those who have this awareness are not unhappy.
('70', 23, 1, 25, 45720) But one who is not conscious of his plight is truly unhappy.
('70', 23, 1, 26, 45781) He is himself a slave but knows not that he is one.
('70', 23, 1, 27, 45833) His predicament is such that if you put ghee on his bread, he will get stomachache.
('70', 23, 1, 28, 45917) As you go farther from Segaon.
('70', 23, 1, 29, 45948) you find the villages more and more exploited.
('70', 23, 1, 30, 45995) If I find the magic cure, I shall achieve everything.
('70', 23, 1, 31, 46049) I am not fond of making speeches.
('70', 23, 1, 32, 46083) If you depend upon me, I shall prove a false support.
('70', 23, 1, 33, 46137) You will have to forget me.
('70', 23, 1, 34, 46165) I am going farther and farther away, and my interest in you is drying up because you do not have that key.
('70', 23, 1, 35, 46272) I shall have to go far to find that key.
('70', 23, 1, 36, 46313) For me, there is no other happiness.
('70', 23, 1, 37, 46350) There is only one joy for me and that is to get a glimpse of God.
('70', 23, 1, 38, 46416) This will be possible when I become one with the poor.
('70', 23, 1, 39, 46471) I can be one with the whole world if I can merge myself in the poor people of a poor country.
('70', 23, 1, 40, 46565) This is my defence before the public.
('70', 23, 1, 41, 46603) I am running away only to find the right key.
('70', 23, 1, 42, 46649) I have been a villager for years.
('70', 23, 1, 43, 46683) I am a villager by temperament.
('70', 23, 1, 44, 46715) I am therfore happy there.
('70', 23, 1, 45, 46742) You cannot afford what I can.
('70', 23, 1, 46, 46772) Today I am being tested.
('70', 23, 1, 47, 46797) I do not know whether or not I shall be able to live for a year in Segaon, how then can I advise others?

('70', 24, 1, 2, 46967) I have run far away.
('70', 24, 1, 3, 46988) I have now served you notice not to depend upon me.
('70', 24, 1, 4, 47040) Even if I have a telegram that I am needed, I may refuse to come.
('70', 24, 1, 5, 47106) Even if the mill owners request me to come, I may say no.
('70', 24, 1, 6, 47164) Anyone who comes to Segaon will get whatever services I can give.
('70', 24, 1, 7, 47230) My sadhana and my samadhi are at Segaon.
('70', 24, 1, 8, 47271) Even if the people of Segaon throw stones at me, my place will be there.
('70', 24, 1, 9, 47344) At first, they did not even let me have water, now we are on slightly better terms.
('70', 24, 1, 10, 47428) But the way is not clear.
('70', 24, 1, 11, 47454) I am not the person to run away from the thorny path.
('70', 24, 1, 12, 47508) I shall sleep there as I would on a bed of flowers if I could get one.
('70', 24, 1, 13, 47579) You have to depend upon your own strength.
('70', 24, 1, 14, 47622) You shall triumph if you fight with God’s strength; if you fight with mine, you will fall into the ditch.
('70', 24, 1, 15, 47728) We are all servants, we serve to the best of our capacity.
('70', 24, 1, 16, 47787) You should depend upon your own and God’s strength.

('70', 24, 5, 20, 47944) AHMEDABAD, October 31, 1936
('70', 24, 6, 21, 47972) What Bhai Munshi told you was not quite ture.
('70', 24, 6, 22, 48018) He told you that in 1925 I resolutely turned down the offer and refused the president ship and further said that if such a request was repeated I would plead helplessness.
('70', 24, 6, 23, 48190) So far so good.
('70', 24, 6, 24, 48206) But Munshi hastened to add that on this occasion I had accepted the presidentship as resolutely as I had declined it earlier.
('70', 24, 6, 25, 48332) But this is not a fact, it is far from the truth.
('70', 24, 6, 26, 48382) I was then not worthy of this honour and I am much less so now.
('70', 24, 6, 27, 48446) I was not at all eager to accept this honour.
('70', 24, 6, 28, 48492) However, I have accepted it, but reluctantly.
('70', 24, 6, 29, 48538) I came because I was faced with a dilemma.
('70', 24, 6, 30, 48581) When friends from whom I expect to take work put some burden on me, I persuade myself to assume it.
('70', 24, 6, 31, 48681) After accepting it I feel ill.
('70', 24, 6, 32, 48712) 1 I sent word asking to be excused and suggesting that they should go ahead with this session without me.
('70', 24, 6, 33, 48818) But as I am a Mahatma, who would accept this suggestion?
('70', 24, 6, 34, 48875) Who knows in whose heart I may be a Mahatma !
('70', 24, 6, 35, 48921) However, to my own self I have already become an alpatma 2. The Mahatma’s word did not avail.
('70', 24, 7, 36, 49015) 1 On December 7, 1935; vide “Letter to Fulchand K. Shah”, 7 12 1935 2 One with a small soul, as opposed to mahatma.
('70', 25, 0, 1, 49131) 26 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('70', 25, 1, 2, 49172) Once I fell ill and could not attend the session.
('70', 25, 1, 3, 49222) And now another difficulty came up.
('70', 25, 1, 4, 49258) Two of my friends in Segaon fell ill and I thought that if I failed to go , I would now be an alpatma for the alpatmas too.
('70', 25, 1, 5, 49382) The Shastras say that a commitment made under certain circumstances may not be operative under certain other circu mstances.
('70', 25, 1, 6, 49507) But I am in the habit of keeping my word to the letter; so I have come.
('70', 25, 1, 7, 49579) But the patients have survived and I am sitting here.
('70', 25, 1, 8, 49633) I had hoped that, before coming to the Conference, I would gather all the literature and read it and prepare my speech after reading it all.
('70', 25, 1, 9, 49774) Today, however, I am bankrupt.
('70', 25, 1, 10, 49805) I could not prepare my speech and sent word that they should not hope for a written address.
('70', 25, 1, 11, 49898) At Segaon, I could not leave my patients unattended; I had then hoped for some peace in Rajkot, where however, every minute was occupied.
('70', 25, 1, 12, 50036) When I came here, I learnt that there was a conflagration— the dispute between the mill owners and the labour was raging.
('70', 25, 1, 13, 50158) I had also hoped that I would look through something at night.
('70', 25, 1, 14, 50221) I even had the necessary material sorted out, but I was engaged in important matters right up to the time of my arrival here.
('70', 25, 1, 15, 50347) Hence I have not even made the necessary preparation for an impromptu speech.
('70', 25, 1, 16, 50425) Has the conference ever made a worse choice?
('70', 25, 1, 17, 50470) This is said to be the twelfth session.
('70', 25, 1, 18, 50510) But I am afraid I won’t be performing the twelfth day rites 1 of the Conference!
('70', 25, 1, 19, 50591) That inauspicious word has fallen to my lot.
('70', 25, 1, 20, 50636) I am however in fact lucky.
('70', 25, 1, 21, 50664) Various kinds of hopes are kindled wherever I happen to go.
('70', 25, 1, 22, 50724) It is hoped I would help give things a new form.
('70', 25, 1, 23, 50773) And if this happens, will it not be as good as doing away with the present idea of the session?
('70', 25, 1, 24, 50869) I have received some Press clippings 2. Twelve amendments to the constitution have been sent to me.
('70', 25, 1, 25, 50969) Although I have gone through them, I have come here without studying the constitution.
('70', 25, 1, 26, 51056) Hence if some legal pundit raises any problem, I shall be perplexed.
('70', 25, 1, 27, 51125) There are twelve items before us on today’s agenda.
('70', 25, 1, 28, 51177) My speech is one of them.
('70', 25, 1, 29, 51203) All these have to be completed before half past five.
('70', 25, 2, 30, 51257) 1 The pun is on barmun which as an adjective means ‘twelfth’ and as a noun ‘the twelfth day rites after death’.
('70', 25, 2, 31, 51369) 2 There had been much criticism in the Press about the so called ‘undemocratic’ character of the constitution of the Gujarati Literary Conference, and it was also said that the constitution was too rigid or too cleverly drafted by Munshi to permit any improvement.
('70', 26, 0, 1, 51634) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 27
('70', 26, 1, 2, 51681) Having made these introductory remarks, I express my gratitude for the burden imposed on me.
('70', 26, 1, 3, 51774) Even if the master gives a kick, the servant apologizes to the former and admits that he had made some mistake and had to be kicked.
('70', 26, 1, 4, 51907) My masters number 33 crores.
('70', 26, 1, 5, 51936) They have not elected me to serve them but I regard myself as their servant.
('70', 26, 1, 6, 52013) You too are included in those crores.
('70', 26, 1, 7, 52051) And, you are doubly my masters as you have elected me.
('70', 26, 1, 8, 52106) However, I have come in the hope that you will some how put up with me.
('70', 26, 2, 9, 52178) I have been unable to go through what appeared in the newspapers about me and the Press clippings which were sent to me.
('70', 26, 2, 10, 52299) I must, however, read the lettters which I get.
('70', 26, 2, 11, 52347) I should read them if only for the sake of courtesy.
('70', 26, 2, 12, 52400) I am regarded as a democrat and I am one.
('70', 26, 2, 13, 52442) Hence these people put their faith in me.
('70', 26, 2, 14, 52484) They pleaded that Munshi was responsible for the constitution of the Conference, that it might be regarded as his monopoly.
('70', 26, 2, 15, 52608) As he is a legal expert, he has so constructed it that we cannot alter a single brick.
('70', 26, 2, 16, 52695) Something can be done, however, if I can shift one or two bricks.
('70', 26, 2, 17, 52761) I may effect certain changes by exercising pressure, willingly or otherwise.
('70', 26, 2, 18, 52838) Besides this, there were some other suggestions too.
('70', 26, 2, 19, 52891) I have not been able to digest these suggestions.
('70', 26, 2, 20, 52941) 1I believe I am a democrat and as such I understand what can be democratic and what not.
('70', 26, 2, 21, 53030) Even when the Congress consitution was drafted, someone objected that they did not want to pay four annas as membership fee.
('70', 26, 2, 22, 53155) I told them that if they had a conscientious objection to paying the fee, they need not want to be members of the Congress.
('70', 26, 2, 23, 53279) Supposing we had a people’s bank—not the usual type of a business concern, but a real people’s bank—how should we run it on democ ratic principles?
('70', 26, 2, 24, 53427) We should have to employ there men not democrati cally elected, but men of proved integrity and character, ready to work for the people’s welfare.
('70', 26, 2, 25, 53574) Then take the instance of High Courts, which we will have even under Ramarajya.
('70', 26, 2, 26, 53654) Must the constitution of a High Court also be democratic?
('70', 26, 2, 27, 53712) Even under true democracy there will be institutions which, in the interests of democracy itself, will have to be run on other than democratic lines.
('70', 26, 2, 28, 53862) I do know where democracy can function and where it cannot.
('70', 26, 2, 29, 53922) Similarly, literary conferences too cannot be run on wholly democratic lines.

('70', 27, 1, 2, 54135) Though I am joking, I want to talk to you of serious matters.
('70', 27, 1, 3, 54197) But by telling you of such things, should I make you cry?
('70', 27, 1, 4, 54255) I do not have such seriousness.
('70', 27, 1, 5, 54287) I should be incapable of such seriousness even if I was about to be hanged.
('70', 27, 1, 6, 54363) Hence, even if I make you laugh, you must listen to me in all seriousness.
('70', 27, 1, 7, 54438) Although I am a democrat, I say such conferences cannot be run on democratic lines.
('70', 27, 1, 8, 54522) They may have the spirit of democracy, but not its procedures.
('70', 27, 1, 9, 54585) I shall be dead by the time the children, women and old men who are now regarded as totally illiterate come to understand the meaning of democracy.
('70', 27, 1, 10, 54733) But those who will be living then should remember that democratic practices cannot apply to such an instituion.
('70', 27, 1, 11, 54845) If they were applied, it would cease to be democracy and become mobocracy.
('70', 27, 1, 12, 54920) Hence I must say all this in all humility to those who have wirtten to me asking me to make these changes if I want democracy.
('70', 27, 1, 13, 55047) This however does not mean that the present consitution which is the creation of Munshi is his monopoly.
('70', 27, 1, 14, 55152) I have read that consitution.
('70', 27, 1, 15, 55182) I am famous for drawing up consitutions at a moment’s notice.
('70', 27, 1, 16, 55244) But I am hardly a legal expert!
('70', 27, 1, 17, 55276) Hence my language is that of the villager, but I can mould it so that both legal experts as well as the common man can understand it.
('70', 27, 1, 18, 55410) I have not yet mortgaged my senses, I can therefore say that Munshi has no monopoly in this constitution.
('70', 27, 2, 19, 55516) You say it has been framed with such consummate cleverness that no one may change a comma or colon in it.
('70', 27, 2, 20, 55622) I refuse to believe it.
('70', 27, 2, 21, 55646) No such constitution has ever been drafted.
('70', 27, 2, 22, 55690) There is no constitution through which one may not drive a coach and four if one so wills.
('70', 27, 2, 23, 55781) I do not know of a perfect constitution having ever been drafted.
('70', 27, 2, 24, 55847) Perfection is the attribute of the Almighty, and yet what a great democrate He is!
('70', 27, 2, 25, 55930) What an amount of wrong and humbug He suffers on our part!
('70', 27, 2, 26, 55989) He even suffers us, insignificant creatures of His, to question His very existence, though He is in every atom about us, around us and within us.
('70', 27, 2, 27, 56135) But He has reserved to Himself the right of becoming manifest to whomsoever He chooses.
('70', 27, 2, 28, 56223) He is a Being without hands and feet and other organs, yet He can be seen by him to whom He chooses to reveal Himself.
('70', 27, 2, 29, 56342) We are a subject nation and Munshi is one of us.
('70', 27, 2, 30, 56391) Munshi cannot conjure into being a constitution of the kind you suggest.
('70', 27, 2, 31, 56464) But even in Russia, Italy and elsewhere there is no constitution which cannot be

('70', 28, 1, 2, 56688) altered.
('70', 28, 1, 3, 56697) Constitutions may indeed be upheld by force of arms, but a flawless constitution is an impossibility.
('70', 28, 1, 4, 56799) I shall therefore make certain suggestions in order to help you to introduce whatever changes you deem necessary.
('70', 28, 1, 5, 56913) All that will be under the constituion.
('70', 28, 1, 6, 56953) You will please trust me to suggest a proper via media.
('70', 28, 1, 7, 57009) I have a suggestion for those who wish to make changes in the constitution of this Parishad.
('70', 28, 1, 8, 57102) Worth while amendments cannot be made within these two days.
('70', 28, 1, 9, 57163) However reluctantly, I am the president.
('70', 28, 1, 10, 57204) I know the President’s prerogative.
('70', 28, 1, 11, 57240) And, I am well aware of the responsibilities, But who is the real president?
('70', 28, 2, 12, 57317) Turning towards Anandshankarbhai: This Vice president is the real person.
('70', 28, 2, 13, 57391) I am only a figurehead.
('70', 28, 2, 14, 57415) He had written to me that he would spare me although I was the President.
('70', 28, 2, 15, 57489) Hence he will take care of all that is to be done.
('70', 28, 2, 16, 57540) The constitution cannot be amended in a couple of days.
('70', 28, 2, 17, 57596) Nor can we burden Anandshankarbhai with this responsibility.
('70', 28, 2, 18, 57657) In order that the Conference may not come to nothing—and this shall not happen so long as I am the President—I shall summon all the skill that I can and recommend amendment of the constitution.
('70', 28, 2, 19, 57851) But I cannot be sure that I shall succeed.
('70', 28, 2, 20, 57894) Whatever I shall point out will be in conformity with the constitution.
('70', 28, 2, 21, 57966) I would never say anything deceitful.
('70', 28, 2, 22, 58004) I have always had the strength to tell the plain truth straight.
('70', 28, 2, 23, 58069) I shall point out those changes which may be made in a straightforward manner, in a manner which will be a hundred per cent straight.
('70', 28, 2, 24, 58203) Now, my address.
('70', 28, 2, 25, 58220) What should I say to the litterateurs?
('70', 28, 2, 26, 58259) Sir Chinubhai has already said that I am neither a scholar nor a litera ry figure.
('70', 28, 2, 27, 58342) However, I am the Kulapati 1 of the Vidyapith; I was instru mental in having the Jodanikosha 2 prepared.Sir Chinubhai referred to the Vidyapith in the past tense.
('70', 28, 2, 28, 58505) I shall beg leave to inform him that the Vidyapith still exists and will continue to exist.
('70', 28, 2, 29, 58597) It is not a passing phase.
('70', 28, 2, 30, 58624) The Vidyapith will continue to function so long as we do not forget the mantra of swaraj.
('70', 28, 2, 31, 58714) The Vidyapith may become a mobile institution like the Ashram.
('70', 28, 2, 32, 58777) Someone happened to donate two and a half lakhs of rupees, and there was a building.
('70', 28, 2, 33, 58862) But would not the Vidyapith have functioned had this building not been there?
('70', 28, 2, 34, 58940) The Vidyapith existed even when there were no funds.
('70', 28, 2, 35, 58993) It was founded in the past, it exists in the present and shall do so in the future.

('70', 29, 1, 2, 59153) undergone transformations and these will continue.
('70', 29, 1, 3, 59204) Gidwani 1 is no longer there, nor are Kripalani 2 or Kaka.
('70', 29, 1, 4, 59263) There are villagers in it.
('70', 29, 1, 5, 59290) But may only scholars run the Vidyapith?
('70', 29, 1, 6, 59331) A man may well be a villager.
('70', 29, 1, 7, 59361) He should be a villager at heart and not merely posing as one.
('70', 29, 1, 8, 59424) There is a community in Kathiawar called Validas who will perform any part they are asked to perform.
('70', 29, 1, 9, 59526) It is not people such as these but those who truly have the heart of a villager who can run the Vidyapith.
('70', 29, 1, 10, 59633) The Vidyapith is not meant for the painted dolls and dandies of Ahmedabad.
('70', 29, 1, 11, 59708) Bhai Ambalal’s daughter 3 may have joined it.
('70', 29, 1, 12, 59754) But the Vidyapith is not a ‘depot’ to which dolls would come to be decorated only to be ‘delivered’ to their parents just as they had come, i.e., returned to their care.
('70', 29, 1, 13, 59924) The Vidyapith has been formed to build up countrymen and countrywomen.
('70', 29, 1, 14, 59995) They do not know how to do it, but they are trying all the same.
('70', 29, 1, 15, 60060) Of such people, it is said in the sixth chapter of the Gita, that they will not ‘meet with a sad end’.
('70', 29, 1, 16, 60163) 4 This is a Divine assurance and it must apply in the case of the faithful.
('70', 29, 1, 17, 60239) Through its contribution in the past, the Vidyapith has fully rewarded those who donated funds to it.
('70', 29, 1, 18, 60341) But, Sir Chinubhai, I wish to tell you that, if the Vidyapith has fully rewarded donors, you will see that it will also continue to do so in the future.
('70', 29, 1, 19, 60494) Now with regard to the Conference.
('70', 29, 1, 20, 60529) What should it do?
('70', 29, 1, 21, 60548) What hopes should I have of it?
('70', 29, 1, 22, 60580) Kaka had written nine pages for my benefit about this.
('70', 29, 1, 23, 60635) Although I have gone through these, I cannot recall anything.
('70', 29, 1, 24, 60697) Dr. Hariprasad wrote a letter, but it is running around somewhere.
('70', 29, 1, 25, 60764) It must be safe somewhere but I could not get at it when starting for this place.
('70', 29, 1, 26, 60846) I asked him to write it down again.
('70', 29, 1, 27, 60882) He did and sent it to me but I received it after I had gone to bed and I have not brought it here.
('70', 29, 1, 28, 60981) Hence, I cannot give anything that he has suggested.
('70', 29, 1, 29, 61034) Such is my misfortune.
('70', 29, 1, 30, 61057) Do I have the time to cook and lay the table?
('70', 29, 1, 31, 61103) But, whatever I say just now is appropriate for me, if not altogether so.
('70', 29, 1, 32, 61177) Because I speak what comes from my heart, without gilding my words.
('70', 29, 1, 33, 61245) The Chairman of the Reception Committee has lightened my burden.
('70', 29, 1, 34, 61310) He has repeated to you what I had earlier told the Literary Conference.
('70', 29, 1, 35, 61382) he did so on the assumption that perhaps I might have to

('70', 30, 1, 3, 61575) But, would a devotee of non violence resort to whipping?
('70', 30, 1, 4, 61632) I would not possess a whip.
('70', 30, 1, 5, 61660) I had then been only polite.
('70', 30, 2, 6, 61689) For whose sake are we going to have our literature?
('70', 30, 2, 7, 61741) For Kasturbhai & Co.?
('70', 30, 2, 8, 61763) For Ambalalbhai or Sir Chinubhai?
('70', 30, 2, 9, 61797) Not certainly for the great gentry of Ahmedabad.
('70', 30, 2, 10, 61846) They can afford to engage literary men and have great libraries in their homes.
('70', 30, 2, 11, 61926) But what about the poor man at the well who with unspeakable abuse is goading his bullocks to pull the big leather bucket?
('70', 30, 2, 12, 62049) Years ago I had asked Sjt.
('70', 30, 2, 13, 62076) Narasinharao, 2 who I am sorry is too aged and ill to be here in our midst, if he could give me something, some inspired tunes or ditties, which this man at the well could lustily sing and forget for ever the filthy abuse in which he indulged without knowing that it was abuse?
('70', 30, 2, 14, 62354) What can I say to him?
('70', 30, 2, 15, 62377) Anyone who is a poet should approach him.
('70', 30, 2, 16, 62419) Munshi is a novelist, he cannot do so.
('70', 30, 2, 17, 62458) Only an extraordinary artist can go and persuade him.
('70', 30, 2, 18, 62512) A couple of words here and a couple of words there and he would put the thing in a way that he will be able to catch the meaning.
('70', 30, 2, 19, 62642) And, Ramanbhai 3 is not even alive today.
('70', 30, 3, 20, 62684) That man belonged to Kochrab, where we had the beginnings of our Satyagr Ahashram.
('70', 30, 3, 21, 62767) But Kochrab is no village, it is a slum of Ahmedabad.
('70', 30, 3, 22, 62821) Jivanlalbhai had a bungalow there.
('70', 30, 3, 23, 62856) Who else but a ghost like me would go to live there?
('70', 30, 3, 24, 62909) Moreover, who could have given him a higher rent in those days?
('70', 30, 3, 25, 62973) But they wanted me to stay there and so Jivanlalbhai offered me his bungalow and Sheth Mangaldas promised monetary help.
('70', 30, 3, 26, 63094) Now I have hundreds of such folks for whom I want real life giving literature.
('70', 30, 3, 27, 63173) How am I to do so?
('70', 30, 3, 28, 63192) I live in Segaon today where in a population of 600 a little over ten are literate, certainly not more than fifty, very likely less.
('70', 30, 3, 29, 63325) Of the ten or more who can read, there are scarcely three or four who can understand what they read, and among the women there is not one who is literate.
('70', 30, 4, 30, 63480) The place is absolutely untouched by Wardha.
('70', 30, 4, 31, 63525) I would have moved farther away had that been the case.
('70', 30, 4, 32, 63581) There we have only malaria.
('70', 30, 4, 33, 63609) But I have an understanding with malaria that it cannot stay on wherever I go.
('70', 30, 4, 34, 63688) There are many puddles there.
('70', 30, 4, 35, 63718) But I came across a

('70', 31, 1, 2, 64022) wealthy person 1 who had a road built.
('70', 31, 1, 3, 64061) People like Anandshankarbhai could not have visited the place under the conditions prevailing six months ago.
('70', 31, 2, 4, 64171) Seventy five per cent of the population are Harijans.
('70', 31, 2, 5, 64225) I have to justify my position as Kulapati of the Vidyapith.
('70', 31, 2, 6, 64285) Now I thought of setting up a little library for them.
('70', 31, 2, 7, 64340) The books had to be of course within their understanding, and so I begged a dozen school books from two or three girls who had no use for them.
('70', 31, 2, 8, 64484) I could make you laugh a great deal if I spoke to you about the authors of those worthless text books and I could talk about them for hours but we don’t have the time.
('70', 31, 2, 9, 64652) The place is a part of Maharashtra.
('70', 31, 2, 10, 64688) There is not as much illiteracy as in Gujarat, but Segaon is almost entirely illiterate.
('70', 31, 2, 11, 64777) I have with me a young man 3 who is an L.L.B. but who has forgotten all his law and cast in his lot with me.
('70', 31, 2, 12, 64886) He is from Gujarat but knows some Marathi.
('70', 31, 2, 13, 64929) He goes to the village and reads to those who come to him from these books whatever they can follow and digest.
('70', 31, 2, 14, 65041) He takes a newspaper or two with him.
('70', 31, 2, 15, 65079) But how is he to make them follow our newpapers?
('70', 31, 2, 16, 65128) What do they know of Spain and of Russia?
('70', 31, 2, 17, 65170) What do they know of geography?
('70', 31, 2, 18, 65202) The place which houses these books worth three and half rupees is such that one cannot sit under the roof during the monsoon.
('70', 31, 2, 19, 65328) If anyone applied a match stick, it would go up in flames.
('70', 31, 2, 20, 65387) It was really Mirabehn’s hut.
('70', 31, 2, 21, 65417) Mirabehn is a self sacrificing person but foolish.
('70', 31, 2, 22, 65468) I had told her that she would not be able to live in a place where people defecated.
('70', 31, 2, 23, 65553) I would live only on the outskirts.
('70', 31, 2, 24, 65589) I must have pure air, pure water and pure food.
('70', 31, 2, 25, 65637) That is my condition for living in a village.
('70', 31, 2, 26, 65683) Fortunately the open place where I live is not used by the people for answering nature’s call.
('70', 31, 2, 27, 65778) But in that hut belonging to Mirabehn we set up a library.
('70', 31, 2, 28, 65837) What am I to read to them?
('70', 31, 2, 29, 65864) Munshi’s novels?
('70', 31, 2, 30, 65881) Or Krishnacharita which Sjt.
('70', 31, 2, 31, 65910) Krishnalal Zaveri has translated from the Bengali?
('70', 31, 2, 32, 65961) It is a good book but I am afraid I cannot place it before these illiterate folks.
('70', 31, 2, 33, 66044) They would take time to understand it.
('70', 31, 2, 34, 66083) This is unfortunate no doubt but ought not you writers to know it from me?
('70', 31, 2, 35, 66158) Who else will tell you this?

('70', 32, 1, 2, 66346) You must know that much as I should have loved to bring with me a Segaon boy here, I have not done so.
('70', 32, 1, 3, 66449) I would have brought one if I paid his fare.
('70', 32, 1, 4, 66494) But what would he do here?
('70', 32, 1, 5, 66521) He would find himself in a strange world.
('70', 32, 1, 6, 66563) But I am here as his representative, as those village folks’ representative, unsolicited, unelected.
('70', 32, 1, 7, 66664) That is true democracy.
('70', 32, 1, 8, 66688) I shall one day ask you to go with me there.
('70', 32, 1, 9, 66733) I am clearing the way for you.
('70', 32, 1, 10, 66764) Of course the road is strewn with thorns, but I shall see that the thorns will not be without roses too.
('70', 32, 1, 11, 66869) As I am speaking to you just now, I am put in mind of Dean Farrar and his book on the life of Christ.
('70', 32, 1, 12, 66971) I may fight the British rule, but I do not hate the English or their language.
('70', 32, 1, 13, 67050) In fact I appreciate their literary treasures.
('70', 32, 1, 14, 67097) And Dean Farrar’s book is one of the treasures of the English language.
('70', 32, 1, 15, 67169) You know how he laboured to produce that book?
('70', 32, 1, 16, 67216) He read everything about Jesus in the English language, and then he went to Palestine, saw every place and spot in the Bible that he could identify, and then wrote the book in faith and prayer, for the masses in England, in a language which all of them could understand.
('70', 32, 1, 17, 67487) It is not in Dr. Johnson’s style but in the easy style of Dickens.
('70', 32, 1, 18, 67554) Have we men like Farrar who will produce great literature for the village folk?
('70', 32, 1, 19, 67634) Our literary men will pore over Kalidasa and Bhavabhuti, and English authors, and will give us imitations.
('70', 32, 1, 20, 67741) I want them to go to villages, study them and give something life giving.
('70', 32, 1, 21, 67815) If, while enjoying such works they develop consumption, sprue or blood pressure, they will still be tempted to go on.
('70', 32, 1, 22, 67933) If then they set out to write books for the villages, their works will be as diseased as they are themselves.
('70', 32, 1, 23, 68043) Villages have no use for such persons.
('70', 32, 1, 24, 68082) They need thoroughly practical men such as described by Narmadashankar.
('70', 32, 1, 25, 68154) Those who go and live in villages as true villagers are needed there more than persons like me who go there with their own thermos flasks; such persons can provide living literature to the people.
('70', 32, 1, 26, 68351) Men like Ravishankar Raval splash their brushes comfortably in Ahmedabad; what would they do if they went to the villages?
('70', 32, 1, 27, 68474) Though I was happy and proud to see what I saw in the exhibition this morning, and felt that I had not seen anything of the kind before in Gujarat, let me tell you that I missed what I would call a painting that speaks.
('70', 32, 1, 28, 68694) Why sould I need an artist to explain a work of art to me?
('70', 32, 1, 29, 68753) Why should it not speak out to me itself?
('70', 32, 1, 30, 68795) I tell you what I mean.
('70', 32, 1, 31, 68819) I saw in the Vatican art collection a stature of Christ on the Cross which simply captured me and kept me spell bound.
('70', 32, 1, 32, 68938) I saw it
('70', 33, 0, 1, 68947) 34 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('70', 33, 1, 2, 68988) five years ago but it is still before me.
('70', 33, 1, 3, 69030) There was no one there to explain its charm to me.
('70', 33, 1, 4, 69081) Here in Belur in Mysore, I saw in the ancient temple a bracket in stone made of a little statuette which spoke out to me without anyone to help me to understand it.
('70', 33, 1, 5, 69246) It was just a woman, half naked, struggling with the folds of her clothes to extricate herself from the shafts of Cupid who is after all lying defeated at her feet in the shape of a scorpion.
('70', 33, 1, 6, 69438) I could see the agony on the form—the agony of the stings of the scorpion.
('70', 33, 1, 7, 69513) That at any rate was my interpretation of it, though Sjt.
('70', 33, 1, 8, 69571) Ravishankar may have another to offer.
('70', 33, 1, 9, 69610) I could speak on to you for hours telling you what I want.
('70', 33, 1, 10, 69669) I want art and literature that can speak to the millions.
('70', 33, 1, 11, 69727) I have given you an outline of the picture.
('70', 33, 1, 12, 69771) You will fill in the details.
('70', 33, 1, 13, 69801) I have said my say.
('70', 33, 1, 14, 69821) My heart is weeping at the present moment, but time has made it hard enough not to break even when there are occasions for it.
('70', 33, 1, 15, 69948) As I think of Segaon and its skeletons.
('70', 33, 2, 16, 69988) At this stage he did, however, break down!
('70', 33, 2, 17, 70031) After a little pause he continued:
('70', 33, 3, 18, 70066) as I think of Segaon and its folk, I can’t help saying that our literature is a miserable affair.
('70', 33, 3, 19, 70164) Principal Anandshankar Dhruva sent me a list of a hundred books, but none of them would do for them.
('70', 33, 3, 20, 70265) What am I to place before them?
('70', 33, 3, 21, 70297) And their women!
('70', 33, 3, 22, 70314) Is there any relation, I wonder, between them and the Ahmedabad ladies I see in front of me?
('70', 33, 3, 23, 70407) The Segaon women know no literature.
('70', 33, 3, 24, 70444) They cannot even repeat the Ramadhun with me.
('70', 33, 3, 25, 70490) They simply know how to drudge and slave away.
('70', 33, 3, 26, 70537) Reckless of sun or rain, of snakes or scorpions, they fetch water, they cut grass and hew wood, and look upon me as their benefactor if I give them work and a few coppers.
('70', 33, 3, 27, 70709) They don’t have an Ambalalbhai to help them with a few coppers.
('70', 33, 3, 28, 70773) What am I to take to these dumb sisters?
('70', 33, 3, 29, 70814) Those dumb millions do not live in Ahmedabad but in the Indain villages.
('70', 33, 3, 30, 70887) The five percent who are literate have a vocabulary of hardly a hundred words or two .
('70', 33, 3, 31, 70974) I know what to take to them.
('70', 33, 3, 32, 71003) But I cannot tell you.
('70', 33, 3, 33, 71026) I am no speaker, neither is the pen my profession.
('70', 33, 3, 34, 71077) I have wirtten what I have, because I could not help it, and at one time I was dumb, so much so that my friends used to call me a dunce, until I went to the courts where too it was with difficulty that I opened my lips.
('70', 33, 3, 35, 71297) It is not my business to speak or to write.
('70', 33, 3, 36, 71341) My business is to live amongst them and show them how to live.
('70', 33, 3, 37, 71404) The key to swaraj is not in the cities but in the villages, and so I have settled in a village—a

('70', 34, 1, 2, 71548) village, too, which I did not go seeking, but which came to me.
('70', 34, 2, 3, 71612) Likewise I had not gone around looking for satyagraha.
('70', 34, 2, 4, 71667) Many of the women from this village gave their love to me much against my will.
('70', 34, 2, 5, 71747) If, however, I were to accept their love, my vow of faithfulness to my wife would be put to shame; hence, I regard them as my mothers.
('70', 34, 2, 6, 71882) I know them as such and worship them as such.
('70', 34, 2, 7, 71928) I invite you to the temple of these mothers.
('70', 34, 3, 8, 71973) Turning towards Keshavlal Dhruva: Keshavlalbhai, I invite you too.
('70', 34, 4, 9, 72040) [K.] Then please grant me longer life as well.
('70', 34, 4, 10, 72087) But then I also must live equally long.
('70', 34, 4, 11, 72127) There is not much difference in our ages.

('70', 34, 8, 15, 72267) AHMEDABAD, November 2, 1936
('70', 34, 10, 16, 72295) Please explain my predicament to the Harijan brethren who would be disappointed at my not coming.
('70', 34, 10, 17, 72393) My soul is in Segaon, and I came here because I had to.
('70', 34, 10, 18, 72449) I will leave for Segaon as soon as the work here is finished.
('70', 34, 10, 19, 72511) I shall certainly try to come to Godhra if God grants me another opportunity.
('70', 34, 10, 20, 72589) There is nothing wrong in putting away the money that the Harijan brethren have raised for the temple.
('70', 34, 10, 21, 72692) Only it should be seen to that it is safe.
('70', 34, 10, 22, 72735) It should bring in interest which should then be added to the principal.
('70', 34, 10, 23, 72808) The simplest possible temple of my imagination would be for us to find a priest with a pure heart and the place where he conducts the worship should be our temple.
('70', 34, 10, 24, 72972) We may make this idea as vivid as we like.
('70', 34, 10, 25, 73015) We should not be in a hurry to spend money on building a temple.
('70', 34, 10, 26, 73080) It would be all right spending money, if there was any, on building a temple if it could be used as a place of worship, a

('70', 35, 3, 5, 73518) 34. SPEECH AT THE CONCLUDING SESSION OF THE TWELFTH GUJARATI SAHITYA PARISHAD, AHMEDABAD 1
('70', 35, 4, 6, 73609) November 2, 1936
('70', 35, 5, 7, 73626) At the outset, I must thank you all.
('70', 35, 5, 8, 73663) Ordinarily, a president always expresses his gratitude, but I do not do so as a matter of tradition.
('70', 35, 5, 9, 73764) I came here because of your love for me.
('70', 35, 5, 10, 73805) I did not even give you the time which I should have given you.
('70', 35, 5, 11, 73869) I made an extempore, undigestedextempore, undigested and worthless speech.
('70', 35, 5, 12, 73944) 2 For this, I should beg your forgiveness.
('70', 35, 5, 13, 73987) I express my heart felt gratitude to you for having put up with me.
('70', 35, 5, 14, 74055) It is not that I do not like to read good essays.
('70', 35, 5, 15, 74105) I have some interests which I cannot satisfy.
('70', 35, 5, 16, 74151) A good many of these have become extinguished, but those that are still alive will keep showing up on every occasion so long as I have not been able to see God.
('70', 35, 5, 17, 74312) Anandshankarbhai told me that a poetry symposium was held here and even young men participated fully.
('70', 35, 5, 18, 74414) I had wished to go to the lecture on the archaeological work in Indore.
('70', 35, 5, 19, 74486) But I neither went to the lecture nor attended the poetry symposium.
('70', 35, 5, 20, 74555) What can it be but generosity on your part that you have put up with all these failings of mine?
('70', 35, 5, 21, 74652) On hearing about the donations for prizes, I was reminded of Carnegie who endowed a large library in Scotland.
('70', 35, 5, 22, 74763) Professors in Scotland told him: ‘If you want to make a donation, why insist on a library?
('70', 35, 5, 23, 74854) You know about business; what can you know of these matters?’ I, too, would tell our philanthropists that if they want to make sure that their money would be well spent they should give us donations without attaching any conditions.
('70', 35, 5, 24, 75087) Today, we have a spate of novels.
('70', 35, 5, 25, 75121) Reading of novels has become a passion.
('70', 35, 5, 26, 75161) These are sprouting like mushrooms.
('70', 35, 5, 27, 75197) If you want to know how a novel is written, I can tell you a good deal about it.
('70', 35, 5, 28, 75278) But it cannot be described before civilized men and women.

('70', 36, 1, 2, 75541) ation can run riot, it knows no restraints.
('70', 36, 1, 3, 75585) However, we can do without these novels.
('70', 36, 1, 4, 75626) The Gujarati language will not be widowed without them.
('70', 36, 1, 5, 75682) At present it is indeed in a state of widowhood.
('70', 36, 1, 6, 75731) When I went to South Africa, I took some Gujarati books with me.
('70', 36, 1, 7, 75796) Taylor’s Gujarati Grammar was one of them.
('70', 36, 1, 8, 75839) I liked it very much.
('70', 36, 1, 9, 75861) This time, too, on the critical night before the Conference, I had taken it out in order to read it.
('70', 36, 1, 10, 75962) But where was the time to read it?
('70', 36, 1, 11, 75997) I remember the epilogue to that grammar.
('70', 36, 1, 12, 76038) Taylor asks in it, “Who said that Gujarati was inade quate?’’“Gujarati, the accomplished daughter of Sanskrit, how could it be inadequate?” And he concluded: “ As the speaker, so the lang uage.
('70', 36, 1, 13, 76232) “It is not its inherent poverty that Gujarati reflects but the poverty of the people speaking it.
('70', 36, 1, 14, 76330) That poverty cannot be wiped out through novels.
('70', 36, 1, 15, 76379) Our language is hardly going to be redeemed through an increase of books like Nandabatrisi.
('70', 36, 1, 16, 76471) I live in a village and so I can acquaint you with my hunger as a villager.
('70', 36, 1, 17, 76547) While doing my matriculation I read a book on astronomy, but no one then asked me to look at the sky.
('70', 36, 1, 18, 76649) Kakasaheb is a man of keen interests.
('70', 36, 1, 19, 76687) In Yeravda jail, he used to gaze at the stars every night.
('70', 36, 1, 20, 76746) I wondered what he could be gazing at.
('70', 36, 1, 21, 76785) But after his release I too asked for books on the subject.
('70', 36, 1, 22, 76845) I wanted a Gujarati book and I even found one although worthless.
('70', 36, 1, 23, 76911) But how could that appease my hunger?
('70', 36, 1, 24, 76949) Could we not give to our villagers a book on astronomy which they could understand?
('70', 36, 2, 25, 77033) But not to speak of astronomy, do we even have books on geography which they could understand?
('70', 36, 2, 26, 77128) The fact is that we have not paid any attention to the villages.
('70', 36, 2, 27, 77193) Although we are dependent upon them for our food and clothing, we behave as if we were their masters.
('70', 36, 2, 28, 77295) We have given no thought whatsoever to their requirements.
('70', 36, 2, 29, 77354) Is there any other country which is so impoverished that it carries on its business in a foreign language while ignoring its own?
('70', 36, 2, 30, 77484) It is for this very reason that our country continues to be poor and our language is in a state of widowhood.
('70', 36, 2, 31, 77594) There is not a single book in French or German, which soon after its publication is not translated into English.
('70', 36, 2, 32, 77707) Abridged versions of the best classics are produced in large numbers for children.
('70', 36, 2, 33, 77790) Have we anything like that in Gujarati?
('70', 36, 2, 34, 77830) If that were the case, I would bless it.
('70', 36, 2, 35, 77871) I had wanted to introduce a resolution on this subject, but now I shall be content with merely making the suggestion.
('70', 36, 2, 36, 77989) I entreat our writers to begin writing for our dumb masses rather than for our city dwellers.
('70', 36, 2, 37, 78083) I am the self appointed representative of that dumb public.
('70', 36, 2, 38, 78143) On their behalf, I ask you to take a plunge into that field.
('70', 36, 2, 39, 78204) You may be writing entertaining stories but these are not going
('70', 37, 0, 1, 78268) 38 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('70', 37, 1, 2, 78309) to make any impression upon their minds.
('70', 37, 1, 3, 78350) We have a school for village workers.
('70', 37, 1, 4, 78388) I asked its teacher to study the tools used in a craft before teaching it, to understand how a basala 1 is made.
('70', 37, 1, 5, 78501) if you wish to develop your mind, you should study village implements, understand their good points and bad points and then write about them.
('70', 37, 1, 6, 78643) Those whose minds are fresh will find new things to see and to learn in villages.
('70', 37, 1, 7, 78725) It is not true that your mental development becomes stunned when you go to the villages.
('70', 37, 1, 8, 78814) My reply to those who say this would be that they must have gone there with close minds.
('70', 37, 1, 9, 78903) Actually the village, and not the city, is the place for the development of the mind.
('70', 37, 1, 10, 78989) I shall say something here which I said yesterday in the Subjects Committee.
('70', 37, 1, 11, 79066) I received a letter from Shrimati Lilavati Desai on behalf of the Jyoti Sangh.
('70', 37, 1, 12, 79145) Although I approve of the substance of the letter I did not like its language.
('70', 37, 1, 13, 79224) Its substance was that what was written about women was painful to them.
('70', 37, 1, 14, 79297) The description of women which was found in current literature was a destorted one.
('70', 37, 1, 15, 79381) These women in exasperation asked whether God had created them in order that men could describe their bodies?
('70', 37, 1, 16, 79491) When they were dead would they embalm their bodies?
('70', 37, 1, 17, 79543) There was no reason to believe that they were created to cook and clean untensils.
('70', 37, 1, 18, 79626) Someone had picked out some striking quotations from Manusmriti and sent these to her.
('70', 37, 1, 19, 79713) He had picked out from Manusmriti whatever disparaging things could be said against women.
('70', 37, 1, 20, 79804) Some women, poor soul, themselves admitted that they were helpless, uncouth and like cattle—but for this reason, could that description apply to all women?
('70', 37, 1, 21, 79960) Why could not someone else have interpolated such ugly verses in Manusmriti?
('70', 37, 1, 22, 80037) Now these women ask the question why they are not described as they really are.
('70', 37, 1, 23, 80117) They are neither Rambhas, celestial maidens, nor slave girls.
('70', 37, 1, 24, 80179) They too are independent human beings like men.
('70', 37, 1, 25, 80227) Why should the latter describe them as if they were dolls?
('70', 37, 1, 26, 80286) Why do not men think of their mothers when they talk of women?
('70', 37, 1, 27, 80349) There was a time when a large number of women stayed with me.
('70', 37, 1, 28, 80411) In South Africa I had become a father or brother of women belonging to about sixty families.
('70', 37, 1, 29, 80504) There were pretty women as well as plain ones amongst them.
('70', 37, 1, 30, 80564) Although these women were illiterate, I brought out the courage in them and they went to jail as bravely as men.
('70', 37, 2, 31, 80677) I ask you to change your point of view.
('70', 37, 2, 32, 80717) I am told that current literature is full of apotheosis of women.
('70', 37, 2, 33, 80783) I do not want such worng apotheosis, such descriptions of

('70', 38, 1, 2, 80930) their eyes, nose, ears and other features.
('70', 38, 1, 3, 80973) Do you ever describe your mother’s features?
('70', 38, 1, 4, 81018) I suggest that before you put your pens to paper keep your mother before your eyes.
('70', 38, 1, 5, 81102) If you do that the literature which will flow from your pen will be like the rain which nurtures the thirsty mother earth.
('70', 38, 1, 6, 81225) But today,
('70', 38, 2, 7, 81236) 35. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS 1
('70', 38, 3, 8, 81263) SABARMATI, [November 2, 1936] 2
('70', 38, 4, 9, 81295) Q. The work of removing untouchability seems to be insuperable.
('70', 38, 4, 10, 81359) How exactly are we to tackle it?
('70', 38, 5, 11, 81392) A. Silent plodding.
('70', 38, 5, 12, 81412) I better tell you how I am doing it in Segaon.
('70', 38, 5, 13, 81459) I do not preach to them, but work away never thinking of the result.
('70', 38, 5, 14, 81528) The one condition is that you should not harbour untouchability in any shape or form .
('70', 38, 5, 15, 81615) I have made it a point to have as many Harijans about me as possible.
('70', 38, 5, 16, 81685) They come as servants but they soon know that they are brothers to us.
('70', 38, 5, 17, 81756) We tolerate no distinction between Harijans.
('70', 38, 5, 18, 81801) Though I cannot present you with tangible results of this silent service, I may safely say that there is a marked change for the better among all—Harijans and the orthodox Hindus.
('70', 38, 6, 19, 81981) It is not quite easy for the Harijans to leave their village where they feel like doing so, as in Kavitha.
('70', 38, 6, 20, 82088) How can they get work?
('70', 38, 7, 21, 82111) A. I still adhere to my advice.
('70', 38, 7, 22, 82143) We should be ashamed of asking them to stay on in the village and suffer the continuing persecution.
('70', 38, 7, 23, 82244) It should not be impossible for us to find work for them.
('70', 38, 7, 24, 82302) The number of those who will migrate will never be large.
('70', 38, 8, 25, 82360) Q. The Bhangis’ lot is pitiable in many places.
('70', 38, 8, 26, 82408) How can they secure their elementary rights from Municipalities?
('70', 38, 9, 27, 82473) A. They must know that they are not bound to serve under all conditions.
('70', 38, 9, 28, 82546) They may leave the work if the Municipality will not listen to them.
('70', 38, 9, 29, 82615) But we have to settle down in their midst and educate them and not make reckless attempts to drive them to strike work.
('70', 38, 9, 30, 82735) They must be taught to know that they have friends.
('70', 38, 9, 31, 82787) Whilst they like others have the right to go on strike, they should know its limitations.
('70', 38, 10, 32, 82877) 1 Extracted from Mahadev Desai’s “Weekly Letter”.
('70', 38, 10, 33, 82927) The questions were asked by a group of Harijan workers of Gujarat and Kathiawar who were spending a month at Harijan Ashram, Sabarmati, learning carding and spinning.
('70', 38, 10, 34, 83094) 2 The date is from Gandhi: 1915 48
('70', 39, 0, 1, 83129) 40 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('70', 39, 1, 2, 83170) should be taught to regard their work as equally dignified with all other social services.
('70', 39, 1, 3, 83261) I have no doubt that they are the most neglected social servants and deserve every assistance we can render them.
('70', 39, 2, 4, 83375) Q. What is the outlook, in view of the precarious financial position of our Ashrams and institutions today?
('70', 39, 3, 5, 83483) A. It is not our financial position but our moral position that is precarious.
('70', 39, 3, 6, 83562) You know the instances of moral lapse that have occurred.
('70', 39, 3, 7, 83620) Purity is the only social foundation.
('70', 39, 3, 8, 83658) No movement or activity that has the sure foundation of purity of character of its workers, is ever in danger of coming to an end for want of funds.
('70', 39, 3, 9, 83807) Then we in Gujarat have to realize that we must not always depend only on our monied men.
('70', 39, 3, 10, 83897) We have to tap humbler resources.
('70', 39, 3, 11, 83931) Our middle classes and even poor classes support so many beggars, so many temples, why will they not support a few good workers?
('70', 39, 3, 12, 84060) We must beg from door to door, beg grain, beg copper coins, do as they do in Bihar and Maharashtra.
('70', 39, 3, 13, 84160) In Maharashtra they have paisa funds and mushti 1 funds.
('70', 39, 3, 14, 84217) It will be the finest form of propaganda among caste Hindus.
('70', 39, 3, 15, 84278) But remember everything will depend on the singleness of your purpose, your devotion to the task and the purity of your character.
('70', 39, 3, 16, 84409) People won’t give for such work unless they are sure of our selflessness.
('70', 39, 4, 17, 84483) Q. What about the Harijans turned Christians who are today no better than Harijans?
('70', 39, 5, 18, 84567) A. Everything will be all right the moment untouchability disappears.
('70', 39, 5, 19, 84637) When there is no untouchability, there will be no occasion for them to label themselves otherwise than as Hindus.
('70', 39, 5, 20, 84751) I am talking of nominal Christians.
('70', 39, 5, 21, 84787) If we put our own house in order, we need have no anxiety about Harijans changing religion as people change clothes.
('70', 39, 6, 22, 84904) Q. If it is impossible to get the caste Hindus’ co operation in antiuntouchability work, would it not be better to take up the village industries work?
('70', 39, 7, 23, 85056) A. That is a delusion.
('70', 39, 7, 24, 85079) You may be sure that he who gives up Harijan work on a pretext like that will be able to do less for the village industries work .
('70', 39, 7, 25, 85210) You can’t settle down in a village and miss the Harijans who are the foundation of society.

('70', 40, 2, 3, 85419) ON THE TRAIN TO BHUSAVAL, November 3, 1936
('70', 40, 3, 4, 85462) MY DEAR IDIOT,
('70', 40, 4, 5, 85477) You have been good in that you have been sendingme letters without receiving anything from me.
('70', 40, 4, 6, 85572) I had simply no time after leaving Segaon.
('70', 40, 4, 7, 85615) And in Ahmedabad I was washed out.
('70', 40, 4, 8, 85650) Last night there was hardly 3 hours’ sleep for I had to detrain at 12 p.m.
('70', 40, 4, 9, 85725) at Baroda to see the Tyabjis and entrain at 2.30 a.m.
('70', 40, 4, 10, 85779) for Surat.
('70', 40, 4, 11, 85790) On the train for Baroda I had to revise Mahadev’s notes and so there was no time to sleep on the train.
('70', 40, 4, 12, 85894) Thank God it is all over and now I have made up for the lost rest.
('70', 40, 4, 13, 85961) For I have been sleeping off and on since 8.30 a.m.
('70', 40, 4, 14, 86013) I have commenced attending to correspondence only just now (4 p.m.).
('70', 40, 4, 15, 86082) I had a long chat with Lady Vidyagauri, Hansa 1 and others.
('70', 40, 4, 16, 86142) I had no time to talk to Mridula 2 after the interview and not at all on the Conference matter.
('70', 40, 4, 17, 86238) I have now written to her 3. I am glad S[hummy] 4 has agreed to your being with me for two months.
('70', 40, 4, 18, 86337) Let us hope and pray that you would be all the better in health for being with me.
('70', 40, 4, 19, 86420) Ba’s hut is being built.
('70', 40, 4, 20, 86445) She went with me from Delhi.
('70', 40, 4, 21, 86474) She will leave A[hmedabad] today for Bombay and pass about a week with Ramdas who is not keeping extra well.
('70', 40, 4, 22, 86583) She will be there about a week.
('70', 40, 4, 23, 86615) Mahadev will also be going to Bombay tonight.
('70', 40, 4, 24, 86661) He had a touch of fever.
('70', 40, 4, 25, 86686) I have kept very fit in spite of overwork.
('70', 40, 4, 26, 86729) I wish you were with me for some functions which were interesting.
('70', 40, 4, 27, 86796) I had gone to Rajkot not to see my sister, though she, too, is there.
('70', 40, 4, 28, 86866) I had gone specially to see my aged cousin 5 and his wife 6, Kanu’s 7 grandparents who gave all his [sic] children for the cause.

('70', 41, 1, 4, 87318) They require hardly any nursing.
('70', 41, 1, 5, 87351) For the most part they are now able to help themselves.

('70', 41, 4, 12, 87611) BHAI KASTURBHAI, I have gone through the papers concerning Gordhanbhai’s demands.
('70', 41, 4, 13, 87693) He has no right to ask for the money.
('70', 41, 4, 14, 87731) Assistance can be given for the labourers’ school in Nadiad but its [accounts] should be scrutinized and the school should function under the supervision of the Majoor Mahajan and your association.
('70', 41, 4, 15, 87929) Such is my firm opinion.
('70', 41, 4, 16, 87954) The correspondence suggests that, according to the resoultion passed, a trust deed should immediately be made.
('70', 41, 4, 17, 88065) I am returning the papers.

('70', 41, 6, 22, 88261) Narmada 2 and Ramnarayan saw me.
('70', 41, 6, 23, 88294) Both of them said they would come to me, would try to understand each other and perhaps follow my suggestion, that is to say, they would break the marriage bond.
('70', 41, 6, 24, 88456) I have no doubt that this is an unholy marriage.
('70', 41, 6, 25, 88505) Their account of it suggests only that.
('70', 41, 6, 26, 88545) Now, if Narmada wishes to live with you according to her under standing with you, have it in writing and then keep her with you.
('70', 41, 6, 27, 88674) Narmada need not come to me at all.

('70', 42, 1, 3, 89073) You told me that you had written a letter to Rajkumari inviting her to stay with you.
('70', 42, 1, 4, 89159) She has not received the letter.
('70', 42, 1, 5, 89192) I have written to her that it is impossible that you would not even reply to her letter.
('70', 42, 1, 6, 89281) I do not insist that you should invite her if you have not done so.
('70', 42, 1, 7, 89349) But you should at least write to her.
('70', 42, 1, 8, 89387) Vidyabehn 1, Sharadabehn 2, Hansabehn 3, etc., had come to me.
('70', 42, 1, 9, 89450) They tell me that you not only refuse to join them in their work but also carry on a campaign against them.
('70', 42, 1, 10, 89558) I told them that I could understand your not joining them but that I was not aware of your carrying on any campaign against them.
('70', 42, 1, 11, 89688) If you think it is proper, meet them in this connection or inform them about whatever you may be doing.
('70', 42, 1, 12, 89792) Or you can write to me.
('70', 42, 1, 13, 89816) I have not been able to understand the meaning of the comment about Pramodabehn’s temple.

('70', 43, 3, 4, 90733) Concerning the financial position of the Harijan Ashrams, you should start doing as I suggested in my reply.
('70', 43, 3, 5, 90842) A defeatist outlook here will lead us nowhere.
('70', 43, 3, 6, 90889) Work should at once begin on the lines I have suggested, and then it should be continued in the manner of the charity box kept in Shriji’s temple.
('70', 43, 3, 7, 91036) I hope you know of Shriji’s box.
('70', 43, 3, 8, 91069) I am very eager to discuss in Harijanbandhu such questions as you have asked but I am not able to manage it.

('70', 43, 8, 16, 91485) How could I when my mind was in Segaon?
('70', 43, 8, 17, 91525) I keep on receiving complaints from Rajaji.
('70', 43, 8, 18, 91569) Give him the enclosed letter.
('70', 43, 8, 19, 91599) I have asked Joshi of Bhavnagar to discuss his scheme with you.

('70', 44, 8, 15, 92563) Hope he is all right.
('70', 44, 8, 16, 92585) I follow what you say about your health.
('70', 44, 8, 17, 92626) I told you that you could come to Segaon when you got well.
('70', 44, 8, 18, 92686) How does it mean that you should not do Khurshedbehn’s work?
('70', 44, 8, 19, 92747) I should be glad if you did.
('70', 44, 8, 20, 92776) I do give you the permission to come but I shall like it better if you take up Khurshedbehn’s work.
('70', 44, 8, 21, 92876) What I should like most is for you to be fully recovered.
('70', 44, 8, 22, 92934) Even the nails should be healthy.
('70', 44, 8, 23, 92968) You will be able to share other people’s sufferings if you yourself are healthy.
('70', 44, 8, 24, 93049) If you don’t regain health, you will make others suffer for you.

('70', 45, 2, 4, 93459) I certainly do not want you to give up any of your vows.
('70', 45, 2, 5, 93516) But a vow means a good vow, i.e., one fit to be taken.
('70', 45, 2, 6, 93571) Your vow to eat only uncooked starchy foods is a bad one.
('70', 45, 2, 7, 93629) One who eats unripe bananas would be regarded a monster.
('70', 45, 2, 8, 93686) You should know that it is the same in the case of uncooked wheat.
('70', 45, 2, 9, 93753) Why should you withhold anything when you have entrusted everything to me?
('70', 45, 2, 10, 93828) When you have enough faith to entrust your future to me why can’t you entrust your present, too?
('70', 45, 2, 11, 93925) I do expect penance not only from you but from all.
('70', 45, 2, 12, 93977) I am therefore, not asking you to pamper the palate when I ask you without hesitation to make some necessary changes in your diet.
('70', 45, 2, 13, 94108) On the contrary I want you to build up your body so as to exact hard work from you.

('70', 45, 5, 17, 94395) The wire will be despatched tomorrow and this, too, will be posted only tomorrow.
('70', 45, 5, 18, 94477) I feel that even writing a confidential letter is very risky.
('70', 45, 5, 19, 94539) Whatever we want to do can be done only after the proclamation 1 is issued.
('70', 45, 5, 20, 94615) And even after it is, it will be befitting to have the celebration only in Travancore.
('70', 45, 5, 21, 94702) It would be too much to give it too big a publicity outside the State.
('70', 45, 5, 22, 94773) However, we shall be able to organize a movement all over India if the proclamation is up to our expectations.
('70', 45, 5, 23, 94884) Whatever it may be, we should not be impatient.
('70', 45, 5, 24, 94932) For my part I don’t at all believe that all temples will be thrown open.
('70', 45, 5, 25, 95005) It will not be dharma but a mere administrative measure if the main temples are not thrown open.
('70', 45, 5, 26, 95102) Calculating policy has no place in dharma.
('70', 45, 5, 27, 95145) We must show a sense of proportion.

('70', 46, 5, 6, 95504) MY DEAR VAKIL, I am thankful for your transparent letter just received.
('70', 46, 5, 7, 95576) I have been in touch with spiritualists for years including, I think, Rishi.
('70', 46, 5, 8, 95653) I do not disbelieve their experiences.
('70', 46, 5, 9, 95692) But I know that the spirits which talk to them are themselves not infallible.
('70', 46, 5, 10, 95770) They are blind guides leading the blind.
('70', 46, 5, 11, 95811) It is of no moment that they say they are not harmed by these conversations.
('70', 46, 5, 12, 95888) That the spiritualists who hold them are harmed I see daily.
('70', 46, 5, 13, 95949) I have painful experiences of some of them becoming unhinged and those who seem to have retained their faculties have certainly suffered weakness of mind.
('70', 46, 5, 14, 96104) If one has faith in God, one should be independent of these spirits than whom there are undoubtedly higher orders of beings.
('70', 46, 5, 15, 96229) Contact with these spirits is a hindrance between God and ourselves.
('70', 46, 5, 16, 96298) I may not carry this argument any further.

('70', 48, 0, 1, 98504) VOL. 70: 21 OCT0BER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 49
('70', 48, 1, 2, 98551) 50. SILK AND COTTON
('70', 48, 2, 3, 98571) There is a subtle rivalry going on just now between hand manufactured silk and khadi hand made from cotton.
('70', 48, 2, 4, 98679) So far as the A.I.S.A. is concerned the matter was settled long ago.
('70', 48, 2, 5, 98748) Certified khadi stores were permitted to stock indigenous silk cloth only to attract more customers for khadi and to enable the stores to make up somewhat for loss on khadi by charging fancy prices for silk cloth.
('70', 48, 2, 6, 98962) The line was often overstepped by overzealous store keepers but never with the approval of the A.I.S.A. Now the manufacturers of silk cloth have discovered that they can easily displace Andhra khadi because they can afford to undersell Andhra saris, and now silk merchants are to be found defying the A.I.S.A. in pushing their wares.
('70', 48, 2, 7, 99296) So far nothing can be said against these merchants for no one is bound to respect the policy of the A.I.S.A. unless its virtue is recognized.
('70', 48, 2, 8, 99438) But in Bombay as elsewhere, too, perhaps, silk merchants have been found doing their business so as to lead the credulous public to believe that they, the merchants, are doing their business with the approval of the A.I.S.A. and in the interest of khadi.
('70', 48, 2, 9, 99693) It is necessary, therefore, to warn the public against being deceived by such devices.
('70', 48, 2, 10, 99780) The public should know that the A.I.S.A. has adopted no arbitrary policy.
('70', 48, 2, 11, 99854) Trade in indigenous silk had not died out when khadi revival was ushered in.
('70', 48, 2, 12, 99931) Khadi can give employment to crores whereas silk hardly to more than a few thousand.
('70', 48, 2, 13, 100016) Khadi is a necessity for both the poor and the rich.
('70', 48, 2, 14, 100069) Silk is a necessity for none but a few who, in order to nourish a religious sentiment, insist on silk garments on certain occasions.
('70', 48, 2, 15, 100202) Hence when it is a question of choice between silk and khadi, naturally those who have the welfare of starving millions at heart will always choose khadi.
('70', 48, 2, 16, 100357) And the very object of the All India Spinners’ Association requires it to give the first place always to khadi made of cotton.
('70', 48, 2, 17, 100484) I say khadi made of cotton in order to avoid confusion in the minds of those who have seen the wider definition of khadi as being cloth hand spun and hand woven out of cotton, silk or wool.This wide definition was and is necessary in order to cover woollen and silken hand spuns when the latter two are used not to supplant cotton hand spuns but to supplement them.
('70', 48, 2, 18, 100850) Thus in winter many people want the warmer woollen or silken stuff.
('70', 49, 0, 1, 100918) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 50
('70', 49, 1, 2, 100959) No one need run away with the idea that the policy I have advocated in these lines disregards the welfare of silk spinners and weavers.
('70', 49, 1, 3, 101095) Nothing can be farther from my thoughts than this.
('70', 49, 1, 4, 101146) For I know that if khadi dies, indigenous silk dies automatically.
('70', 49, 1, 5, 101213) Japanese silk and the artificial imitation from the West will sweep every piece of indigenous cloth out of existence.
('70', 49, 1, 6, 101331) It is the khadi spirit which has enabled Kashmir woollens and Bengal Assam silks to hold their own.
('70', 49, 1, 7, 101431) It is the far seeing policy of the A.I.S.A. which in protecting cotton khadi against all odds automatically protects indigenous hand spuns made of wool or silk.
('70', 49, 1, 8, 101592) Put the three in competition with one another and you dig the grave of all the three.
('70', 49, 1, 9, 101678) Lastly, let it be remembered that if cotton khadi lives but silk dies, the hands left idle due to the death of silk can easily take up cotton spinning and weaving, but if silk displaces cotton, it cannot employ the crores that will be without occupation or chance of it due to the death of cotton khadi.
('70', 49, 1, 10, 101982) It seems to me, therefore, to be the obvious duty of all lovers of Daridranarayana to prefer cotton khadi always when the question of making a choice confronts them.
('70', 49, 1, 11, 102148) It will be economical in the long run to pay for the present dearer prices for fine cotton khadi than for the corresponding fine silk wear.
('70', 49, 2, 12, 102288) Harijan, 7 11 1936
('70', 49, 3, 13, 102307) 51. ONE THING NEEDFUL
('70', 49, 4, 14, 102329) The one thing needful for effective Harijan service and, for that matter, all service of the poor, the forlorn, the helpless, is purity of personal character in the servant.
('70', 49, 4, 15, 102503) Without it possession of even the highest intellectual ability and administrative capacity is of no account.
('70', 49, 4, 16, 102612) It may even prove a hindrance, whereas possession of a pure character combined with love of such service will assuredly develop or provide the requisite intellectual and administrative capacity.
('70', 49, 4, 17, 102807) This reflection is prompted by the discovery of very painful instances of grave moral lapses on the part of two well known workers in the Harijans’ cause.
('70', 49, 4, 18, 102962) They were both regarded by all who knew them to be above suspicion and of unsullied character.
('70', 49, 4, 19, 103057) They have both been betrayed into conduct unworthy of those occupying the positions they did.
('70', 49, 4, 20, 103151) They were no doubt victims of lust that was hiding like a deadly snake in a dark corner of their hearts.
('70', 49, 4, 21, 103256) But poor mortals that we are, we cannot read into others’ hearts.
('70', 49, 4, 22, 103322) We can but, and we must, judge other fellow men by their acts which we can see and handle.
('70', 49, 4, 23, 103413) In these two
('70', 50, 0, 1, 103426) VOL. 70: 21 OCT0BER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 51
('70', 50, 1, 2, 103473) cases they are such as to make it impossible for them to remain as workers in the Harijan Sevak Sangh.
('70', 50, 1, 3, 103576) This would be no punishment.
('70', 50, 1, 4, 103605) Their withdrawal would be necessary for the protection of the Sangh and its cause if not also for themselves.
('70', 50, 1, 5, 103715) I can safely say that it will be unnecessary for the Sangh to take any step against them.
('70', 50, 1, 6, 103805) These workers will themselves retire from the Sangh and, I hope, from all public activity.
('70', 50, 1, 7, 103896) The duty of service is denied to none.
('70', 50, 1, 8, 103935) A person who has had a grievous moral fall but has come to his senses will serve no matter where he is placed.
('70', 50, 1, 9, 104046) His very reformation will be a service of society.
('70', 50, 1, 10, 104097) But performance of such service that comes of itself and is rendered almost secretly is wholly different from being in an organization and enjoying all its privileges.
('70', 50, 1, 11, 104265) For such re entry into public life a complete restoration of public confidence is absolutely necessary.
('70', 50, 1, 12, 104369) There is in modern public life a tendency to ignore altogether the character of a public worker so long as he works efficiently as a unit in an administrative machinery.
('70', 50, 1, 13, 104539) It is said that everybody’s character is his own private concern.
('70', 50, 1, 14, 104605) Though I have known this view to have been often taken I have never been able to appreciate, much less to adopt, it.
('70', 50, 1, 15, 104722) I have known the serious consequences overtaking organizations that have counted private character as a matter of no consequence.
('70', 50, 1, 16, 104852) Nevertheless the reader will have, observed that for my immediate purpose I have restrictecd the application of my proposition only to organizations like the Harijan Sevak Sangh which make themselves trustees for the welfare of the dumb millions.
('70', 50, 1, 17, 105099) I have no manner of doubt that possession of a spotless character is the indispensable requisite of such service.
('70', 50, 1, 18, 105213) Workers in the Harijan cause or for khadi or for village industries must come in closest touch with utterly unsophisticated, innocent, ignorant men and women who might be likened to children in intelligence.
('70', 50, 1, 19, 105421) If they have not character, they must fail in the end and for ever damn the cause they espouse in the surroundings in which they are known.
('70', 50, 1, 20, 105561) I write from experience of such cases.
('70', 50, 1, 21, 105600) Happily they are rare enough for the numbers engaged in such services, but frequent enough to call for publc warning and caution on the part of organizations and workers who are engaged in such services.
('70', 50, 1, 22, 105804) These last cannot be too watchful or too exacting of themselves.

('70', 51, 3, 4, 105987) MY DEAR IDIOT, Your letter.
('70', 51, 3, 5, 106015) I hope this will reach you in Simla.
('70', 51, 3, 6, 106052) It is joyous news that S[hummy] denied himself aspirin for full one week and you were gracious enough to have only two tabloids during the whole Simla season.
('70', 51, 3, 7, 106211) Let us hope now you won’t need even two during your lifetime which extend to 100 years.
('70', 51, 3, 8, 106299) Your sales of khadi certainly went beyond even my expectations.
('70', 51, 3, 9, 106363) All this due to the effort of a mere woman—frail in body and idiot mentally !!!
('70', 51, 3, 10, 106443) No, wonder poor khadi workers in Simla are trembling over the prospect of you absence during the next Simla season.
('70', 51, 3, 11, 106559) But we need not worry about the future which is in God’s hands.
('70', 51, 3, 12, 106623) You will give a good account of yourself no matter where you are.
('70', 51, 3, 13, 106689) Nanavati is so well that he is leaving today to pass a few days among the members of his family and friends whilst he is gaining strength.
('70', 51, 3, 14, 106828) He is a wonderful worker.
('70', 51, 3, 15, 106854) Mira is chirpy.
('70', 51, 3, 16, 106870) Balwant Singh is weak.
('70', 51, 3, 17, 106893) He must overwork himself and take chapati even when he must not.
('70', 51, 3, 18, 106958) You were extravagant in buying the thermos, the magnificent apples.
('70', 51, 3, 19, 107026) But you would not be a Rajkumari if you were not extravagant.
('70', 51, 3, 20, 107088) You are none the less so because you spend on others.
('70', 51, 3, 21, 107142) If you counted yourself a trustee, as you should, of all you possess including your body, you would be balanced in using them even for your trust.
('70', 51, 3, 22, 107289) You may not philosophically smile this simple truth away.
('70', 51, 3, 23, 107347) Remember the value of a rupee in terms of the poor.
('70', 51, 3, 24, 107399) It means 64 solid meals which millions do not have.
('70', 51, 3, 25, 107451) Many in Segaon live on a rupee per month, i.e., only two meals a day costing one pice each.
('70', 51, 3, 26, 107543) But millions do not get this much.
('70', 51, 3, 27, 107578) How can you and I, knowing this as well as that I am writing this, mis spend a pice?
('70', 51, 3, 28, 107663) Will you be wise for a while?
('70', 51, 3, 29, 107693) If you will become the—or a—woman of my imagination, you will have to develop all your faculties, not excluding account keeping.
('70', 51, 3, 30, 107822) And how about your Hindi?
('70', 51, 3, 31, 107848) Will you send me a good portable copy of Granth Sahib in Hindi with translation?

('70', 53, 15, 25, 110097) Your remark was fully justified.
('70', 53, 15, 26, 110130) The request had come to me before I went to Benares.
('70', 53, 15, 27, 110183) I pooh poohed it then.
('70', 53, 15, 28, 110206) It was repeated on my return with greater emphasis.
('70', 53, 15, 29, 110258) The reason was indifferent health.
('70', 53, 15, 30, 110293) I believed it and capitulated.
('70', 53, 15, 31, 110324) This is no separate kitchen.
('70', 53, 15, 32, 110353) They want no facilities involving expense.

('70', 54, 1, 3, 110537) At the same time I have told Zaverbhai that he should not rest content with the withdrawal of these young men from his kitchen.
('70', 54, 1, 4, 110665) He must so arrange that he can find suitable food for them.
('70', 54, 1, 5, 110725) Is my position clear and sound?

('70', 54, 7, 10, 110844) You have entirely stopped writing to me because of my tours.
('70', 54, 7, 11, 110905) I returned on the 4th and am writing this after waiting for your letter.
('70', 54, 7, 12, 110978) Both the patients are well.
('70', 54, 7, 13, 111006) Nanavati left for Bombay yesterday to see the members of his family.
('70', 54, 7, 14, 111075) Ba is in Bombay.
('70', 54, 7, 15, 111092) Nimu 1 has become quite weak.
('70', 54, 7, 16, 111122) Vasumati has come to Segaon for a few days.
('70', 54, 7, 17, 111166) Khan Saheb and Mehrtaj are of course with me.

('70', 54, 13, 23, 111393) MY DEAR REBEL,
('70', 54, 14, 24, 111408) You are nasty and of little faith.
('70', 54, 14, 25, 111443) Why should you always know that your letters are welcome?
('70', 54, 14, 26, 111501) Taken to its logical extent, it means that you have always to wire whether your letter will be welcome.
('70', 54, 14, 27, 111605) Why can you not take it for granted?
('70', 54, 14, 28, 111642) So somehow or other you have succeeded in sending me an instrument case!

('70', 56, 2, 3, 113040) November 9, 1936
('70', 56, 3, 4, 113057) NARANDAS,
('70', 56, 4, 5, 113067) It is good that you wrote to me.
('70', 56, 4, 6, 113100) The letter 1 for Vithal is enclosed herewith.
('70', 56, 4, 7, 113146) Give him a spinning wheel worth about Rs. 5 or khadi or books of the same value, whichever he prefers.
('70', 56, 4, 8, 113249) If you find Rs. 5 too much, then make it less.
('70', 56, 4, 9, 113296) It was Vallabh’s suggestion to take Balkrishna to Jamnagar.
('70', 56, 4, 10, 113356) I accepted it deliberately as I like sun bath treatment which I understand is given to everyone at Jamnagar.
('70', 56, 4, 11, 113465) I would rather that Balkrishna was given drugs orally than through injections.
('70', 56, 4, 12, 113544) As Balkrishna has no preference of his own, the whole burden rests on me.
('70', 56, 4, 13, 113618) I thought it proper to accept the Jamnagar suggestion which happened to present itself.
('70', 56, 4, 14, 113706) I thought it a duty to do at least this much for Balkrishna, seeing that I had to do much more for others who showed themselves more impatient.
('70', 56, 4, 15, 113850) Ultimately the hut is there as the last resort.
('70', 56, 4, 16, 113898) However, if Talwalkar insists and he is not cured by the time, his treatment will have to be tried.
('70', 56, 4, 17, 113998) I have sent the clarification about the purse for Harijanbandhu 2. I would be glad if you take up the khadi activity in Kathiawar.
('70', 56, 4, 18, 114129) Maganlal Patel was chosen because an uncle only in name is better than no uncle.
('70', 56, 4, 19, 114210) If you take up the work in Kathiawar and do not ask for any financial help from the central office of the Sangh, you will be able to organize your activities as you wish.
('70', 56, 4, 20, 114381) You ought to have the zest and be able to see your way clearly.
('70', 56, 4, 21, 114445) If you take up the work, you may perhaps be able to get more help from the Indian States.
('70', 56, 4, 22, 114535) You may even make Ramjibhai take interest in the work again.
('70', 56, 4, 23, 114596) For my part I leave everything to you.
('70', 56, 4, 24, 114635) I could not recognize Tara.
('70', 56, 4, 25, 114663) I shall of course write to her.

('70', 57, 3, 5, 115152) I shall see what to do about the honey and the bottle.
('70', 57, 3, 6, 115207) I should have given you Khakharis 1 for the journey.
('70', 57, 3, 7, 115260) You should increase your diet gradually.
('70', 57, 3, 8, 115301) I think your weight is all right and for the present you should go up by at least 2 lb.
('70', 57, 3, 9, 115389) per week.
('70', 57, 3, 10, 115399) I hope you are getting fairly good fruit there.
('70', 57, 3, 11, 115447) Things here go on well.

('70', 57, 7, 16, 115690) [On or after November 9, 1936] 3
('70', 57, 8, 17, 115723) GANDHIJI: Their behaviour has been as bad as that of the rest who are in the field to add to their numbers.
('70', 57, 8, 18, 115831) What pains one is their frantic attempt to exploit the weakness of Harijans.
('70', 57, 8, 19, 115908) If they said, ‘Hinduism is a diabolical religion and you come to us,’ I should understand.
('70', 57, 8, 20, 115999) But they dangle earthly paradises in front of them and make promises to them which they can never keep.
('70', 57, 8, 21, 116103) When in Bangalore 4 a deputation of Indian Christians came to me with a number of resolutions which they thought would please me, I said to them: ‘This is no matter for bargain.
('70', 57, 8, 22, 116281) You must say definitely that this

('70', 57, 9, 24, 116412) Andrews had just returned from a visit to New Zealand, Fiji and Australia and had been, since his return, in correspondence with various missionaries.
('70', 57, 9, 25, 116563) He wanted to know Gandhiji’s reaction to the attitude of the missionaries.
('70', 57, 9, 26, 116638) 3 According to Gandhi—1915 1948: A Detailed Chronology, Andrews arrived in Segaon on November 9. Vide also “Letter to Amrit Kaur”, 9 11 1936 4 Gandhi was in Bangalore from 31 5 1936 to 13 6 1936.
('70', 58, 0, 1, 116834) VOL. 70: 21 OCT0BER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 59
('70', 58, 1, 2, 116881) is a matter to be settled by the Hindus themselves.
('70', 58, 1, 3, 116933) Where is the sense of talking of a sudden awakening of spiritual hunger among the untouchables and then trying to exploit a particular situation?
('70', 58, 1, 4, 117079) The poor Harijans have no mind, no intelligence, no sense of difference between God and no God.
('70', 58, 1, 5, 117175) It is absurd for a single individual to talk of taking all the Harijans with himself.
('70', 58, 1, 6, 117261) Are they all bricks that they could be moved from one structure to another?
('70', 58, 1, 7, 117337) If Christian Missions here want to play the game, and for that matter Mussalmans and others, they should have no such idea as that of adding to their ranks whilst a great reform in Hinduism is going on’.
('70', 58, 2, 8, 117541) C.F.A. Let me ask one question.
('70', 58, 2, 9, 117573) I said in Australia that all the talk of Dr. Ambedkar and his followers was not in terms of religion, and I said also that it was cruelty to bargain with unsophisticated people like the Harijans as they are in most parts of India.
('70', 58, 2, 10, 117804) Then came the London Missionary Society’s statement that the Ezhavas in Travancore had asked for Christian instruction.
('70', 58, 2, 11, 117924) I said then that the Ezhavas were quite enlightened and if they had really asked to be instructed in Christianity, it would be an entirely different matter.
('70', 58, 2, 12, 118081) Was I right?
('70', 58, 3, 13, 118094) GANDHIJI: I do not think so.
('70', 58, 3, 14, 118123) Whilst there are individual Ezhavas who are doctors and barristers and so on, the vast majority of them are just the same as the Harijans elsewhere.
('70', 58, 3, 15, 118272) I can assure you that no one representing the vast body of Ezhavas could have asked for Christian instruction.
('70', 58, 3, 16, 118383) You should ascertain the fact from our principal workers there.
('70', 58, 4, 17, 118447) C.F.A. I see what you mean.
('70', 58, 4, 18, 118475) Only I wanted to say that the London Missionary Society was a liberal body and would not make an irresponsible statement.
('70', 58, 5, 19, 118597) GANDHIJI: But they at the centre cannot know, as the Parliament cannot know the truth of what is happening in India.
('70', 58, 6, 20, 118714) C.F.A. But that apart, I should like to discuss the fundamental position with you.
('70', 58, 6, 21, 118797) What would you say to a man who after considerable thought and prayer said that he could not have his peace and salvation except by becoming a Christian?
('70', 58, 7, 22, 118951) GANDHIJI: I would say that if a non Christian, say a Hindu, came to a Christian and made that statement, he should ask him to become a good Hindu rather than find goodness in change of faith.
('70', 58, 8, 23, 119143) C.F.A. I cannot in this go the whole length with you, though you know my own position.
('70', 58, 8, 24, 119230) I discarded the position that there is no salvation except through Christ long ago.
('70', 58, 8, 25, 119314) But supposing the Oxford Group Movement people changed the life of your son, and he felt like being converted, what would you say?
('70', 58, 9, 26, 119445) GANDHIJI: I would say that the Oxford Group may change the lives of as many as they like, but not their religion.
('70', 58, 9, 27, 119559) They can draw
('70', 59, 0, 1, 119573) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 60
('70', 59, 1, 2, 119614) their attention to the best in their respective religions and change their lives by asking them to live according to them.
('70', 59, 1, 3, 119737) There came to me a man, the son of Brahmin parents, who said his reading of your book had led him to embrace Christianity.
('70', 59, 1, 4, 119860) I asked him if he thought that the religion of his forefathers was wrong.
('70', 59, 1, 5, 119934) He said ‘No.’ Then I said: ‘Is there any difficulty about your accepting the Bible as one of the great religious books of the world and Christ as one of the great teachers?’ I said to him that you had never through your books asked Indians to take up the Bible and embrace Christianity, and that he had misread your book—unless of course your position is like that of the late Maulana Mahomed Ali’s, viz., that a believing Mussalman, however bad his life, is better than a good Hindu.
('70', 59, 2, 6, 120419) C.F.A. I do not accept Maulana Mahomed Ali’s position at all.
('70', 59, 2, 7, 120481) But I do say that if a person really needs a change of faith I should not stand in his way.
('70', 59, 3, 8, 120573) GANDHIJI: But don’t you see that you do not even give him a chance?
('70', 59, 3, 9, 120641) You do not even cross examine him.
('70', 59, 3, 10, 120676) Supposing a Christian came to me and said he was captivated by a reading of the Bhagavata and so wanted to declare himself a Hindu, I should say to him: ‘No.
('70', 59, 3, 11, 120834) What the Bhagavata offers the Bible also offers.
('70', 59, 3, 12, 120883) You have not yet made the attempt to find it out.
('70', 59, 3, 13, 120933) Make the attempt and be a good Christian.’
('70', 59, 4, 14, 120976) C.F.A. I don’t know.
('70', 59, 4, 15, 120997) If someone earnestly says that he will beocme a good Christian, I should say, ‘You may become one’, though you know that I have in my own life strongly dissuaded ardent enthusiasts who came to me.
('70', 59, 4, 16, 121194) I said to them, ‘Certainly not on my account will you do anything of the kind.’ But human nature does require a concrete faith.
('70', 59, 5, 17, 121322) GANDHIJI: If a person wants to believe in the Bible let him say so, but why should he disregard his own religion?
('70', 59, 5, 18, 121436) This proselytization will mean no peace in the world.
('70', 59, 5, 19, 121490) Religion is a very personal matter.
('70', 59, 5, 20, 121526) We should, by living the life according to our light, share the best with one another, thus adding to the sum total of human effort to reach God.
('70', 59, 5, 21, 121672) Consider whether you are going to accept the position of mutual toleration or of equality of all religions.
('70', 59, 5, 22, 121780) My position is that all the great religions are fundamentally equal.
('70', 59, 5, 23, 121849) We must have the innate respect for other religions as we have for our own.
('70', 59, 5, 24, 121925) Mind you, not mutual toleration, but equal respect.

('70', 60, 9, 13, 122406) Get hold of Harbhai’s monthly and send it to me.
('70', 60, 9, 14, 122455) By a happy coincidence, just as I was leaving, Jivanji put into my hands your work Sukhmani and Kaka’s Jivanno Anand.
('70', 60, 9, 15, 122573) When I started on Sukhmani it so engaged my attention that I could not put it down.
('70', 60, 9, 16, 122657) I write this after finishing it—except for the “Ashtapadis”.
('70', 60, 9, 17, 122718) I did that in the “Library”.
('70', 60, 9, 18, 122747) What else could I have done?
('70', 60, 9, 19, 122776) I have now begun reading the “Ashtapadis” too!
('70', 60, 9, 20, 122823) But that I will do at my leisure.

('70', 60, 9, 23, 122932) In the language of your essays I feel there is something lacking, though I cannot lay my finger on it.
('70', 60, 9, 24, 123035) However I found your translation of the essays of Puran Singh and Vaswani quite pleasing.
('70', 60, 9, 25, 123125) Only you can tell why it should be so, or maybe it is only my feeling.
('70', 60, 9, 26, 123196) This is, however, an unimportant point and your book is useful for students as also others.
('70', 60, 9, 27, 123288) You have done well in raising a doubt about the words which McAuliffe puts into Guru Arjun’s mouth on the subject of the Shastras.
('70', 60, 9, 28, 123419) McAuliffe has no doubt put in great labour into his work.
('70', 60, 9, 29, 123477) But I suspected him as far back as 1922 when I read all his chapters in Jail.
('70', 60, 9, 30, 123555) Later I heard that it was thanks to him that Hindus and Sikhs became disunited.
('70', 60, 9, 31, 123635) You should write a Sikh history if you have the

('70', 61, 1, 3, 123802) You have to read a vast amount of literature on the subject for the purpose, move among the Sikhs, ransack the library of the Khalsa community and meet Sir Joginder Singh.
('70', 61, 1, 4, 123974) Probably you know that he is a great writer.
('70', 61, 1, 5, 124019) It is not a small thing to write a good history.
('70', 61, 1, 6, 124068) I greatly appreciate your study as revealed in Sukhmani.
('70', 61, 1, 7, 124125) I see that you are interested in the subject and therefore you may be able to undertake the task.
('70', 61, 1, 8, 124223) A superficial book will not satisfy me.
('70', 61, 1, 9, 124263) May be for many years to come this is the work cut out for you.

('70', 61, 13, 24, 124726) Why are you in a hurry to send me the shawl?
('70', 61, 13, 25, 124771) Whenever it comes, depend upon it I shall wear it.
('70', 61, 13, 26, 124822) Therefore deliver it yourself or send it through someone who may be coming and save the postage for a better purpose.
('70', 61, 13, 27, 124940) I won’t be any party to your becoming a miser nor can I tolerate criminal extravagance at the expense of the poor.

('70', 62, 6, 14, 125630) I could stay at Rajkot for just a few hours.
('70', 62, 6, 15, 125675) I reached there in the morning and left at night.
('70', 62, 6, 16, 125725) I had a long meeting with Bali 2 and Kumi 3. Aunt 4 too had come.
('70', 62, 6, 17, 125791) I missed you much at Ahmedabad.
('70', 62, 6, 18, 125823) Ba arrived here today bringing Kana 5 with her.

('70', 62, 6, 20, 125961) Vasumati is here.
('70', 62, 6, 21, 125979) She will leave for Bochasan in two or three days.

('70', 63, 7, 23, 127569) Therefore his activities are bound to bear good fruit.
('70', 63, 7, 24, 127624) I hope his faith in khadi has not diminished.
('70', 63, 7, 25, 127670) I got the feeling that he was exhausted somewhat.

('70', 64, 3, 4, 128251) Your letter is very good.
('70', 64, 3, 5, 128277) My right hand needs rest.
('70', 64, 3, 6, 128303) I consider .
('70', 64, 3, 7, 128316) .’s 1 error a serious one.
('70', 64, 3, 8, 128343) There is certainly no place for guess work in the matter of food.
('70', 64, 3, 9, 128409) One should know for certain every item one eats.
('70', 64, 3, 10, 128458) If you have the necessary facility have hip bath early in the morning and then go out for a walk.
('70', 64, 3, 11, 128556) Eat after that.
('70', 64, 3, 12, 128572) Mirabehn has her bath at 5.45 a.m.; then walks two to three miles and after that she takes milk, etc.
('70', 64, 3, 13, 128674) Now keep up the quantity of rotli, ghee and leafy vegetables in your diet and increase gradually the intake of milk and curd up to 3 lb.
('70', 64, 3, 14, 128811) Do not give up garlic.
('70', 64, 3, 15, 128834) Take whatever honey is available there.
('70', 64, 3, 16, 128874) See if you can get it in the Khadi Bhandar.
('70', 64, 3, 17, 128918) However, if grapes are available honey is not so necessary.
('70', 64, 3, 18, 128978) For my part, these days I take jaggery, which you saw here, with water.
('70', 64, 3, 19, 129050) I may be taking about two tolas of it.
('70', 64, 3, 20, 129089) I like it, but you should do whatever suits you.
('70', 64, 3, 21, 129138) I shall see about Gajanan.
('70', 64, 3, 22, 129165) Now we are finding things here interesting.
('70', 64, 3, 23, 129209) The experiments continue.

('70', 64, 3, 25, 129257) Harilal’s letter has no effect on me.
('70', 64, 3, 26, 129295) The motive behind it is to get money out of me.
('70', 64, 3, 27, 129343) However, I would not be surprised if doing that he should come to his senses one day.
('70', 64, 3, 28, 129429) Of course you did well in writing to me as I knew nothing of it before I got your letter.

('70', 65, 1, 3, 129986) In any case I am more and more drawn to crafts.
('70', 65, 1, 4, 130034) It is my feeling that for getting rid of your illness you should give up writing as a literary activity.
('70', 65, 1, 5, 130139) Wherever you may be, I would like to make a labourer of you.
('70', 65, 1, 6, 130200) But you do not find this to your taste.
('70', 65, 1, 7, 130240) It is also my feeling that you should get married and practice what self control you can while leading a married life.
('70', 65, 1, 8, 130359) Your nature being what it is I see no other course.
('70', 65, 1, 9, 130411) You have been partial to me and you have felt drawn to me.
('70', 65, 1, 10, 130470) but this is attachment.
('70', 65, 1, 11, 130494) It seems to me that your ideal is somewhat different from mine.
('70', 65, 1, 12, 130558) Therefore even if you come to Wardha you will again become restless.
('70', 65, 1, 13, 130627) The best thing for you would be to forget me.
('70', 65, 1, 14, 130673) If you cannot do so, keep your self away and digest what you can.
('70', 65, 1, 15, 130739) Even loha bhasma can be taken only in prescribed doses, which are different for different people.
('70', 65, 1, 16, 130837) The same may be said of a teacher.
('70', 65, 1, 17, 130872) All teaching cannot be assimilated by all in the same quantity.
('70', 65, 1, 18, 130936) Very few people have gained anything by staying near me.
('70', 65, 1, 19, 130993) I know nothing about Dandekar.
('70', 65, 1, 20, 131024) It will be no use speaking to Sethji now.

('70', 66, 8, 10, 132374) What can I do.?
('70', 66, 8, 11, 132390) I do not remember anything about Harilal.
('70', 66, 8, 12, 132432) Why should you not write short letters?
('70', 66, 8, 13, 132472) 1. You may go to see Harilal.
('70', 66, 8, 14, 132502) You can take Ramdas or anybody else to accompany you.
('70', 66, 8, 15, 132556) I hope no one will prevent you.
('70', 66, 8, 16, 132588) In my eyes Harilal’s conversion is meaningless.
('70', 66, 8, 17, 132636) 2. I expect Kanti came to see you.
('70', 66, 8, 18, 132671) It is not as if I forbade him thinking that you were no good, but he himself does not want to see you.
('70', 66, 8, 19, 132774) He does not wish to enter into argument with you.
('70', 66, 8, 20, 132824) What then is the sense in your insisting on seeing him?
('70', 66, 8, 21, 132880) Think of Kanti’s happiness and calm down.
('70', 66, 8, 22, 132922) 3. I would soon send for you if I could improve your health by having you with me, but I just don’t believe I can.

('70', 67, 2, 3, 133297) [After November 12, 1936] 2
('70', 67, 3, 4, 133325) The modern miracle in Travancore is mainly due to the influence of women, or if you please, to the influence of one woman, Her Highness the Maharani of Travancore.
('70', 67, 3, 5, 133489) When I was in Travancore some years ago 3, I met the Maharani.
('70', 67, 3, 6, 133552) She was determined to do what was the purest act of justice, and it is she who is really at the back of the Maharaja’s decision.
('70', 67, 3, 7, 133681) It was a most courageous act to issue the proclamation and still more courageous to carry it out to the letter.
('70', 67, 3, 8, 133793) The Maharaja could not have done it without the support of his mother.
('70', 67, 3, 9, 133864) So I see the hand of woman in this miracle.
('70', 67, 3, 10, 133908) The opening of temples would not have been possible without the widest co operation of the caste Hindus.
('70', 67, 3, 11, 134013) It is a unique demonstration of the power of non violence.
('70', 67, 3, 12, 134072) I had thought that the State would at least have to post a strong police force at the main temples, and that at least a few heads would be broken.
('70', 67, 3, 13, 134219) The process began with the biggest State temple, the one that the Maharaja visits himself.
('70', 67, 3, 14, 134310) There was no political pressure here.
('70', 67, 3, 15, 134348) It could not be imposed on a million people.
('70', 67, 3, 16, 134393) I had no idea that there were nearly 2,000 temples in Travancore.
('70', 67, 3, 17, 134459) I only knew that ten years ago our volunteers had been severely hammered for even crossing a forbidden road near the temple at Vaikom.
('70', 67, 3, 18, 134594) Now the humblest of the humble have entered the Vaikom temple without the slightest difficulty.
('70', 67, 3, 19, 134690) The proclamation did not enthuse me, though it was a solid thing.
('70', 67, 3, 20, 134756) For I had feared that there might be a political motive behind it.
('70', 67, 3, 21, 134823) But all my fears have been dispelled.
('70', 67, 3, 22, 134861) That the orthodoxy, who used to swear by the letter of the ritual and made so much of the efficacy of temple worship being destroyed by even the shadow of a pariah, would fall in with the proclamation, is a thing I was not prepared for, so soon at any rate.
('70', 67, 3, 23, 135119) But God has made possible what man could not have done.

('70', 68, 2, 3, 135529) SEGAON, WARDHA, November 13, 1936
('70', 68, 3, 4, 135563) AMTUL SALAAM,
('70', 68, 4, 5, 135577) I got your long letter.
('70', 68, 4, 6, 135601) I feel very sorry for Bari’s health.
('70', 68, 4, 7, 135638) What is the reason of his ill health?
('70', 68, 4, 8, 135676) I got the honey and fruit as also the Koran.
('70', 68, 4, 9, 135721) Why did you send the fruit?
('70', 68, 4, 10, 135749) If you have so much money, why don’t you send it to me?
('70', 68, 4, 11, 135805) It will be very good if you can settle the quarrel between the two brothers.
('70', 68, 4, 12, 135882) Make an effort.
('70', 68, 4, 13, 135898) May God help you.
('70', 68, 4, 14, 135916) How foolish you are !
('70', 68, 4, 15, 135938) Who said you were bad when you were told not to write to Kanti or see him?
('70', 68, 4, 16, 136013) Of late I have neither written to him nor got a letter from him.
('70', 68, 4, 17, 136078) For my part I know no Diwali and how could there be any in Bombay where a holi is raging?
('70', 68, 4, 18, 136168) I do not like festivals at all.
('70', 68, 4, 19, 136200) Are we worthy of the festivals?
('70', 68, 4, 20, 136232) This is what I think about you.
('70', 68, 4, 21, 136264) You should stay there, improve your health and then come to me.
('70', 68, 4, 22, 136328) Where else can you be treated?
('70', 68, 4, 23, 136359) If you are prepared to go to Bangalore, I can arrange for that.
('70', 68, 4, 24, 136423) You can certainly get medical aid there.
('70', 68, 4, 25, 136464) But you will not get anywhere the facilities available in Bombay.
('70', 68, 4, 26, 136530) Do not even think of observing the Ramzan fast.
('70', 68, 4, 27, 136578) Get well and then observe as many fasts as you like.
('70', 68, 4, 28, 136631) I would have allowed you to obrerve the Ramzan fast at Segaon, had you recovered fully.
('70', 68, 4, 29, 136719) I shall write a letter to Dinshaw if you want to consult him.
('70', 68, 4, 30, 136781) What was the point in deciding to go to Mecca and giving it up soon after?
('70', 68, 4, 31, 136856) I think now you have the answers to all your questions.
('70', 68, 5, 32, 136912) Blessings from BAPU

('70', 68, 8, 35, 137002) A sister 1 sending me a cutting from a well known magazine containing the advertisement of a most objectionable book writes:
('70', 68, 9, 36, 137127) 1 Amrit Kaur; vide “Letter to Amrit Kaur”, 21 10 1936
('70', 69, 0, 1, 137181) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 70
('70', 69, 1, 2, 137222) The enclosed came under my eye when glancing over the pages of .
('70', 69, 1, 3, 137287) I do not know if you get this magazine.
('70', 69, 1, 4, 137327) I do not suppose you ever have time to glance at it even if it is sent to you.
('70', 69, 1, 5, 137406) Once before I spoke to you about ‘obscene advertisements’.
('70', 69, 1, 6, 137465) I do so wish you would write about them some time.
('70', 69, 1, 7, 137516) That books of the type advertised are flooding the market today is only too true, but should responsible journals like .
('70', 69, 1, 8, 137637) encourage their sale?
('70', 69, 1, 9, 137659) My woman’s modesty is so utterly repelled by these things that I cannot write to anyone but you.
('70', 69, 1, 10, 137756) To think that what God has given to woman with intent for an express purpose should be advertised for abuse is too degrading for words.
('70', 69, 1, 11, 137892) I wish you would write about the responsibility of leading Indian newspapers and journals in this respect.
('70', 69, 1, 12, 137999) This is not the first by any means that I could have sent to you for criticism.
('70', 69, 2, 13, 138079) From the advertisement I do not propose to reproduce any portion except to tell the reader that it describes as obscenely as it can the suggestive contents of the book advertised.
('70', 69, 2, 14, 138259) Its title is Sexual Beauty of the Female Form and the advertising firm tells the reader that it will give away free to the buyer two more books called New knowledge for the Bride and the Sexual Embrace or How to Please Your Partner.
('70', 69, 3, 15, 138492) I fear that in relying on me in any way to affect the course of the advertisers of such books or to move the editors or publishers from their purpose of making their productions yield profits, she relies on a broken reed.
('70', 69, 3, 16, 138714) No amount of appealing by me to the publishers of the objectionable books or advertisements of them will be of any use.
('70', 69, 3, 17, 138834) But what I would like to tell the writer of the letter and other learned sisters like her is to come out in the open and to do the work that is peculiarly and specially theirs.
('70', 69, 3, 18, 139011) Very often a bad name is given to a person and he or she in course of time begins to believe in the badness.
('70', 69, 3, 19, 139120) To call a woman member of ‘the weaker sex’ is a lible.
('70', 69, 3, 20, 139175) In what way is woman the weaker sex I do not know.
('70', 69, 3, 21, 139226) If the implication is that she lacks the brute instinct of man or does not possess it in the same measure as man, the charge may be admitted.
('70', 69, 3, 22, 139368) But then woman becomes, as she is, the nobler sex.
('70', 69, 3, 23, 139419) If she is weak is striking, she is strong in suffering.
('70', 69, 3, 24, 139475) I have described woman as the embodiment of sacrifice and ahimsa.
('70', 69, 3, 25, 139541) She has to learn not to rely on man to protect her virtue or her honour.
('70', 69, 3, 26, 139614) I do not know a single instance of a man having ever protected the virtue of a woman.
('70', 69, 3, 27, 139700) He cannot even if he would.
('70', 69, 3, 28, 139728) Rama certainly did not protect the virtue of
('70', 70, 0, 1, 139773) VOL. 70: 21 OCT0BER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 71
('70', 70, 1, 2, 139820) Sita, nor the five Pandavas of Draupadi.
('70', 70, 1, 3, 139861) Both these noble women protected their own virtue by the sheer force of their purity.
('70', 70, 1, 4, 139947) No person loses honour or self respect but by his consent.
('70', 70, 1, 5, 140006) A woman no more loses her honour or virtue because a brute renders her senseless and ravishes her than a man loses his because a wicked woman administers to him a stupefying drug and makes him do what she likes.
('70', 70, 1, 6, 140218) It is remarkable that there are no books written in praise of male beauty.
('70', 70, 1, 7, 140293) But why should there always be literature to excite the animal passions of man?
('70', 70, 1, 8, 140373) May it be that woman likes to live up to the titles that man has chosen to bestow upon her?
('70', 70, 1, 9, 140465) Does she like to have the beauty of her form exploited by man?
('70', 70, 1, 10, 140528) Does she like to look beautiful of form before man and why?
('70', 70, 1, 11, 140588) These are questions I would like educated sisters to ask themselves.
('70', 70, 1, 12, 140657) If these advertisements and litreature offend them, they must wage a relentless war against them and they will stop them in a moment.
('70', 70, 1, 13, 140791) Would that woman will realize the power she has latent in her for good if she has also for mischief.
('70', 70, 1, 14, 140892) It is in her power to make the world more livable both for herself and her partner, whether as father, son or husband, if she would cease to think of herself as weak and fit only to serve as a doll for man to play with.
('70', 70, 1, 15, 141112) If society is not to be destroyed by insane wars of nations against nations and still more insane wars on its moral foundations, the woman will have to play her part not manfully, as some are trying to do, but womanfully.
('70', 70, 1, 16, 141334) She won’t better humanity by vying with man in his ability to destroy life mostly without purpose.
('70', 70, 1, 17, 141433) Let it be her privilege to wean the erring man from his error which will envelop in his ruin that of woman also.
('70', 70, 1, 18, 141546) This wretched advertisement is merely a straw showing which way the wind is blowing.
('70', 70, 1, 19, 141631) It is a shameless exploitation of woman.
('70', 70, 1, 20, 141672) It would not leave alone even “the beauty of female form of savage races of the world”.
('70', 70, 2, 21, 141760) Harijan, 14 11 1936
('70', 70, 3, 22, 141780) 79. TEMPLE ENTRY
('70', 70, 4, 23, 141797) A co worker writes:
('70', 70, 5, 24, 141817) A worker in the Harijan cause came in the other day and wanted money for a Harijan temple and school in Phagwara (Jullundur) District).
('70', 70, 5, 25, 141953) I resolutely refused money for a ‘temple’, because I am dead against the building of all such, especially exclusive ones for the Harijans, for it is one form of perpetuating their ‘untouchability’, and just as he was vehemently arguing
('70', 71, 0, 1, 142189) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 72
('70', 71, 1, 2, 142230) with me the postman brought in Harijan with your article 1 on this theme.
('70', 71, 1, 3, 142304) It was quite a godsend.
('70', 71, 1, 4, 142328) Some sanatanists, I understand, are trying to induce Harijans to build a temple for themselves, so that they need not then claim entry into existing temples.
('70', 71, 1, 5, 142486) The Harijans really need protection in this respect and your article has not come a bit too soon.
('70', 71, 2, 6, 142584) I had a huge discussion the other day with a mutual acquaintance about your advocating ‘temple entry’ for Harijans.
('70', 71, 2, 7, 142700) The friend maintained:
('70', 71, 3, 8, 142723) ‘(a) The Mahatma never goes to worship in a temple himself; why, then, does he encourage Harijans to do so?
('70', 71, 3, 9, 142831) For advocating ‘temple entry’ is an indirect means of encouraging worship in temples.
('70', 71, 4, 10, 142917) (b) Our ‘temples’ are in the vast majority of cases solely means of livelihood for priests who are incapable of earning an honest living in any other way.
('70', 71, 4, 11, 143072) Why encourage them?
('70', 71, 5, 12, 143092) (c) To every priest in charge of such temples the entrance of Harijans will mean more money because no one can go to a temple without putting in a pice (minimum).
('70', 71, 6, 13, 143255) (d) Why impoverish the Harijan community?
('70', 71, 7, 14, 143297) (e) Why can’t the Mahatma teach Harijans to worship in the open air as he does himself?’
('70', 71, 8, 15, 143386) I do not know if these questions have been specifically put to you by others and whether you have ever answered them and think it worth while doing so.
('70', 71, 8, 16, 143538) I do feel, however, that Harijans must not be allowed to build separate temples for themselves and that the removal of the ban on temple entry will purify the caste Hindu only.
('70', 71, 8, 17, 143715) The Harijan has to raise himself in other ways with his own as well as our help.
('70', 71, 8, 18, 143796) This letter contains the answer, too, to the questions raised therein.
('70', 71, 8, 19, 143867) Nevertheless it invites publicity and discussion.
('70', 71, 8, 20, 143917) These questions have been often raised and equally often discussed in these columns in some shape or other.
('70', 71, 8, 21, 144025) The worker who wanted a donation for a separate temple for Harijans, and the one who put the various conundrums before the writer of the letter reproduced above, missed the main reason for temple entry.
('70', 71, 8, 22, 144228) The demand for opening all temples to the Harijans is made not because the Harijans desire entry, or that when the temples are thrown open to them they will become changed beings.
('70', 71, 8, 23, 144408) The demand is made for the purification of caste Hindus.
('70', 71, 8, 24, 144465) It is made
('70', 71, 9, 25, 144476) 1 “Task before Harijan Sevaks”, vide “Task Before Harijan Sevaks”, 10 10 1936
('70', 72, 0, 1, 144554) VOL. 70: 21 OCT0BER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 73
('70', 72, 1, 2, 144601) because Harijans are deprived wrongfully of a right that belongs to every Hindu.
('70', 72, 1, 3, 144682) Even though not a single Harijan enters Hindu temples, it is the duty of caste Hindus to throw them open to their brethren the Harijans.
('70', 72, 1, 4, 144819) It is the truest sign of removal of untouchability from the caste Hindu heart.
('70', 72, 1, 5, 144898) The other disabilities have undoubtedly to go, but if this one remains untouchability does not die.
('70', 72, 1, 6, 144998) The civil disabilities will go in course of time, whether caste Hindus wish it or not, but the temples cannot be opened without their free will.
('70', 72, 1, 7, 145143) There is nothing to prevent a Harijan from drawing water from a public well or demanding at a public school equal treatment with the other pupils.
('70', 72, 1, 8, 145290) He does not do so today in a vast majority of cases, only because he is yet too timid to assert his legal right.
('70', 72, 1, 9, 145403) He has reason to be afraid of physical hurt and worse from the caste Hindus.
('70', 72, 1, 10, 145480) But as he grows from strength to strength, he will certainly assert himself and exercise the right which, owing to his helplessness, he has been hitherto unable to exercise.
('70', 72, 1, 11, 145654) Not so, however, about temple entry.
('70', 72, 1, 12, 145691) If Harijans in a body marched to a temple, they would be prevented by law from entering that temple.
('70', 72, 1, 13, 145792) Hence the necessity for agitation by caste Hindu reformers for opening their temples to Harijans.
('70', 72, 1, 14, 145890) As to temples designed specially for Harijans, I have always opposed such projects.
('70', 72, 1, 15, 145974) But there have always been reservations.
('70', 72, 1, 16, 146015) I would not oppose a movement among Harijans themselves for building a temple accessible to both themselves and the caste Hindus.
('70', 72, 1, 17, 146145) Nor would I oppose the building of such temples by caste Hindus.
('70', 72, 1, 18, 146210) In other words I do not always oppose the building of temples as such.
('70', 72, 1, 19, 146281) I think that they play an important and useful part in the lives of millions of people.
('70', 72, 1, 20, 146369) That I do not go to the orthodox temples is irrelevant to the issue before us.
('70', 72, 1, 21, 146448) In order to prove my belief in temples, I need not be a visitor myself.
('70', 72, 1, 22, 146520) Surely it is enough that I believe in God and offer daily worship not as a mere formality but as an integral part of my spiritual food.
('70', 72, 1, 23, 146656) Of course I go out of my way to invite Harijans to attend the daily open air worship.
('70', 72, 1, 24, 146742) I do so, however, not to wean them from the desire to visit orthodox temples.
('70', 72, 1, 25, 146820) Corruption in the temples there undoubtedly is.
('70', 72, 1, 26, 146868) The illiteracy and cruel ignorance of the priests in charge of most temples is deplorable.
('70', 72, 1, 27, 146959) But that is a reason for their reformation, not condemn ation to destruction.
('70', 72, 1, 28, 147037) Nor need Harijans pay anything to the priests.
('70', 72, 1, 29, 147084) Thousands visit temples without paying even a pie.
('70', 72, 1, 30, 147135) I verily believe that

('70', 73, 3, 5, 147422) [November 13/14, 1936] 2
('70', 73, 4, 6, 147447) JOHN MOTT: You have been one that has given a great initiative to the movement, you have put your life blood into it, you have suffered and triumphed, and I want you to help me to a profound understanding of what the issues are and tell me how I may help, for I do not want to hinder.
('70', 73, 4, 7, 147732) What is happening in India is going to have a profound effect on the world.
('70', 73, 4, 8, 147808) We are in front of forces the influence of which it would be difficult to prophesy or predict.
('70', 73, 4, 9, 147903) Give me your own diagnosis of the problem.
('70', 73, 5, 10, 147946) GANDHIJI: So far as I am concerned with the untouchability question, it is one of life and death for Hinduism.
('70', 73, 5, 11, 148057) As I have said repeatedly, if untouchability lives Hinduism perishes, and even India perishes; but if untouchability is eradicated from the Hindu heart root and branch, then Hinduism has a definite message for the world.
('70', 73, 5, 12, 148278) I have said the first thing to hundreds of audiences, but not the latter part.
('70', 73, 5, 13, 148357) Now that is the utterance of a man who accepts Truth as God.
('70', 73, 5, 14, 148418) It is therefore no exaggeration.
('70', 73, 5, 15, 148451) If untouchability is an integral part of Hinduism, the latter is a spent bullet.
('70', 73, 5, 16, 148532) But untouchability is hideous untruth.
('70', 73, 5, 17, 148571) My motive in launching the [anti ] untouchability campaign is clear.
('70', 73, 5, 18, 148640) What I am aiming at is not every Hindu touching an untouchable, but every touchable Hindu driving untouchability from his heart, going through a complete change of heart.
('70', 73, 5, 19, 148811) Inter dining or intermarrying is not the point.
('70', 73, 5, 20, 148859) I may not dine with you, but I ought not to harbour the feeling that if I dined with you I should be polluted.
('70', 73, 5, 21, 148970) If I was a woman to be married, I should not say ‘I cannot marry a man because he is an untouchable.’ I am making this clear to you because in the programme of the Harijan Sevak Sangh we say we
('70', 73, 6, 22, 149164) 1 Extracted from Mahadev Desai’s report “Dr. Mott’s Visit”.
('70', 73, 6, 23, 149224) John Mott was an American evangelist, a prominent Y.M.C.A. leader and Chairman, International Missionary Council.
('70', 73, 6, 24, 149338) 2 The source gives no date.
('70', 73, 6, 25, 149366) Vide, however, “Letter to Amrit Kaur”, 14 11 1936, where Gandhiji says: “I gave over four hours to Dr. or Mr. Mott with Andrews between yesterday and today”.
('70', 73, 6, 26, 149524) Mahadev Desai’s evidence seems to contradict this.
('70', 73, 6, 27, 149575) He says: This talk was taking place exactly at the moment when the Travancore Proclamation was being issued” which was on the 12. But Mahadev Desai was writing several days after the talks.
('70', 74, 0, 1, 149765) VOL. 70: 21 OCT0BER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 75
('70', 74, 1, 2, 149812) don’t ask the orthodox Hindus to inter dine or intermarry with the ‘untouchables’.
('70', 74, 1, 3, 149895) Many of us have no scruples about inter dining or intermarriage.
('70', 74, 1, 4, 149960) That untouchability is an ancient custom I admit, but there are many such things intertwined with Hinduism because it is an ancient religion, even a prehistoric religion.
('70', 74, 1, 5, 150131) Instead of being the dead faith that it threatens to be, I want it to be a living faith, so that it may exist side by side with other religions of the world.
('70', 74, 2, 6, 150289) With this he explained, the genesis of the Harijan Sevak Sangh, and how he could not be a member of the Sangh, and yet that he had directed and guided the policy of the Sangh.
('70', 74, 3, 7, 150465) “The world looks upon you,” said Dr. Mott, “as a front line prophet, conscience, initiator and warrior, and we pray that you may be spared long for this most fateful period in the life of the world.”
('70', 74, 4, 8, 150665) The conversation led to the genesis of the Yeravda Pact 1 beginning with Gandhiji’s declaration, at the Round Table Conference, to lay down his life to stop the vivisection of Hinduism.
('70', 74, 5, 9, 150851) G. But I had no political axe to grind, I have none.
('70', 74, 5, 10, 150904) Nor have the other Hindus a political motive.
('70', 74, 5, 11, 150950) For instance, the Pact has been a kind of bombshell thrown in the midst of Bengalis.
('70', 74, 5, 12, 151035) They have their own Hindu Muslim problem which has been rendered difficult by the Yeravda Pact.
('70', 74, 5, 13, 151131) The original Premier’s ‘Award’ 3, as it was called, gave fewer seats to the Harijans than the Pact gives.
('70', 74, 5, 14, 151237) It is almost an overwhelming number.
('70', 74, 5, 15, 151274) But I said Hinduism loses nothing if all the seats were captured by the Harijans.
('70', 74, 5, 16, 151356) I would not alter a comma in the Pact unless the Harijans themselves wanted it.
('70', 74, 6, 17, 151436) JOHN MOTT: Removal of untouchability is the business of your life time.
('70', 74, 6, 18, 151508) The importance of this movement lies beyond the frontiers of India, and yet there are few subjects on which there is more confusion of thought.
('70', 74, 6, 19, 151652) Take for instance the missionaries and missionary societies.
('70', 74, 6, 20, 151713) They are not of one mind.
('70', 74, 6, 21, 151739) It is highly desirable that we become of one mind and find out how far we can help and not hinder.
('70', 74, 6, 22, 151838) I am Chairman of the International Missionary Council which combines 300 missionary societies in the world.
('70', 74, 6, 23, 151946) I have on my desk reports of these societies, and I can say that their interest in the untouchables is deepening.I should be interested if
('70', 74, 7, 24, 152085) 1 Of September 1932 between Hindu leaders and the Depressed Classes; vide Vol. LI, Appendix II.
('70', 74, 7, 25, 152181) 2 Vide “Speech at West Minster School”,13 11 1931 3 This announced the British Government’s scheme of providing separate electorate for the Depressed classes.

('70', 75, 0, 1, 152390) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 76
('70', 75, 1, 2, 152431) you would feel free to tell me where, if anywhere, the missionaries have gone along wrong lines.
('70', 75, 1, 3, 152528) Their desire is to help and not to hinder.
('70', 75, 2, 4, 152571) I cannot help saying that the activities of the missionaries in this connection have hurt me.
('70', 75, 2, 5, 152665) They with the Mussalmans and the Sikhs came forward as soon as Dr. Ambedkar threw the bombshell, and they gave it an importance out of all proportion to the weight it carried, and then ensued a rivalry between these organizations.
('70', 75, 2, 6, 152896) I could understand the Muslim organizations doing this, as Hindus and Muslims have been quarrelling.
('70', 75, 2, 7, 152997) The Sikh intervention is an enigma.
('70', 75, 2, 8, 153033) But the Christian mission claims to be a purely spiritual effort.
('70', 75, 2, 9, 153099) It hurt me to find Christian bodies vying with the Muslims and Sikhs in trying to add to the numbers of their fold.
('70', 75, 2, 10, 153215) It seemed to me an ugly performance and a travesty of religion.
('70', 75, 2, 11, 153279) They even proceeded to enter into secret conclaves with Dr. Ambedkar.
('70', 75, 2, 12, 153349) I should have understood and appreciated your prayers for the Harijans, but instead you made an appeal to those who had not even the mind and intelligence to understand what you talked; they have certainly not the intelligence to distinguish between Jesus and Mohammed and Nanak and so on.
('70', 75, 3, 13, 153639) Dr. Mott referred to the Archbishop of Canterbury’s speech 1, and the talks he
('70', 75, 4, 14, 153718) had with him, and other bishops and missionary leaders in England, and emphasized the fact that the Christians should in no way seem to be bidding with others for the souls of the Indian people.
('70', 75, 4, 15, 153913) He said he had a reassurance from the Free as well as the State Church leaders, but in the secular papers it had got abroad that Dr. Ambedkar could hand over 50 million people to those who were prepared to accept them.
('70', 75, 4, 16, 154132) He had sensed that it might mean a tremendous disservice.
('70', 75, 4, 17, 154190) He said: “The most trustworthy leaders of Protestant missionary forces would give to what you have said great heed.
('70', 75, 4, 18, 154306) They do believe increasingly in work for the untouchables.
('70', 75, 4, 19, 154365) Tell us what we can wisely do and what we cannot wisely do.”
('70', 75, 5, 20, 154426) G. So far as this desire of Dr. Ambedkar is concerned, you can look at the whole movement with utter calmness and indifference.
('70', 75, 5, 21, 154554) If there is any answer to Dr. Ambedkar’s appeal and if the Harijans and he take the final step and come to you, you can take such steps as your conscience suggests.
('70', 75, 5, 22, 154719) But today it seems unseemly and precipitate to anticipate what Dr. Ambedkar and Harijans are going to do.
('70', 75, 6, 23, 154825) Deenabandhu Andrews referred with condemnation to the Lucknow Conference and Dr. Mott said that what the Conference did was not authoritative.
('70', 75, 7, 24, 154968) 1 Vide “What Is a Miracle?”, 19 12 1936.
('70', 76, 0, 1, 155009) VOL. 70: 21 OCT0BER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 77
('70', 76, 1, 2, 155056) G. It becomes authoritative owing to the silence of Christian bodies.
('70', 76, 1, 3, 155126) If they had disowned all that happened it would have been well, but those who met at Lucknow perhaps felt that they were voicing the views of the missionary bodies who, in their opinion, were not moving fast enough.
('70', 76, 2, 4, 155342) J. M. But there was a disclaimer.
('70', 76, 3, 5, 155376) G. If there was, it did not travel beyond the English Channel.
('70', 76, 4, 6, 155439) J. M. But there is a deplorable confusion of thought and divided counsel even amongst friends.
('70', 76, 4, 7, 155534) The Devil would like nothing better.
('70', 76, 4, 8, 155571) My life has been mostly spent for the intellectual classes, and I feel very much conscience moved to help in this movement.
('70', 76, 5, 9, 155695) Gandhiji cited the example of good Christians helping by working under the Hindu banner.
('70', 76, 5, 10, 155784) There was Mr. Keithahn 1 who was trying hard to smooth the path of the untouchables.
('70', 76, 5, 11, 155869) There were Miss Barr and Miss Madden who had thrown themselves into the rural reconstruction movement.
('70', 76, 5, 12, 155972) He then adverted to the problem in Travancore where an indecent competition was going on for enticing away the Ezhavas from the Hindu fold.
('70', 76, 6, 13, 156112) G. The Ezhavas in Travancore want temple entry.
('70', 76, 6, 14, 156160) But it is no use your asking me whether they want temple entry.
('70', 76, 6, 15, 156224) Even if they do not want it, I must see that they enjoy the same rights as I enjoy, and so the reformers there are straining every nerve to open the temple doors.
('70', 76, 7, 16, 156387) J. M. But must we not serve them?
('70', 76, 8, 17, 156421) G. Of course you will, but not make conversion the price of your service.
('70', 76, 9, 18, 156495) J. M. I agree that we ought to serve them whether they become Christians or not.
('70', 76, 9, 19, 156576) Christ offered no inducements.
('70', 76, 9, 20, 156607) He offered service and sacrifice.
('70', 76, 9, 21, 156641) G. If Christians want to associate themselves with this reform movement they should do so without any idea of conversion.
('70', 76, 10, 22, 156763) J. M. Apart from this unseemly competition, should they not preach the Gospel with reference to its acceptance?
('70', 76, 11, 23, 156875) G. Would you, Dr. Mott, preach the Gospel to a cow?
('70', 76, 11, 24, 156927) Well, some of the untouchables are worse than cows in understanding.
('70', 76, 11, 25, 156996) I mean they can no more distinguish between the relative merits of Islam and Hinduism and Christianity than a cow.
('70', 76, 11, 26, 157111) You can only preach through your life.
('70', 76, 11, 27, 157150) The rose does not say: ‘Come and smell me.’
('70', 76, 12, 28, 157194) 1 R. R. Keithahn, an American missionary
('70', 77, 0, 1, 157235) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 78
('70', 77, 1, 2, 157276) J. M. But Christ said: ‘Preach and Teach,’ and also that Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
('70', 77, 1, 3, 157390) There was a day when I was an unbeliver.
('70', 77, 1, 4, 157431) Then J. E. K. Studd of Cambridge, a famous cricketer, visited my University on an evangelistic mission and cleared the air for me.
('70', 77, 1, 5, 157562) His life and splendid example alone would not have answered my question and met my deepest need, but I listened to him and was converted.
('70', 77, 1, 6, 157700) First and foremost we must live the life; but then by wise and sympathetic unfolding of essential truth we must shed light on processes and actions and attitudes, and remove intellectual difficulties so that it may lead us into the freedom which is freedom indeed.
('70', 77, 1, 7, 157965) You do not want the Christians to withdraw tomorrow?
('70', 77, 2, 8, 158018) But I do not want you to come in the way of our work, if you cannot help us.
('70', 77, 3, 9, 158095) J. M. The whole Christian religion is the religion of sharing our life, and how can we share without supplementing our lives with words?
('70', 77, 4, 10, 158232) G. Then what they are doing in Travancore is correct?
('70', 77, 4, 11, 158286) There may be a difference of degree in what you say and what they are doing, but there is no difference of quality.
('70', 77, 4, 12, 158402) If you must share it with the Harijans, why don’t you share it with Thakkarbapa and Mahadev?
('70', 77, 4, 13, 158495) Why should you go to the untouchables and try to exploit this upheaval?
('70', 77, 4, 14, 158567) Why not come to us instead?
('70', 77, 5, 15, 158595) J. M. The whole current discussion since the Ambedkar declaration has become badly mixed with other unworthy motives, which must be eliminated.
('70', 77, 5, 16, 158739) Jesus said: ‘Ye shall be witnesses unto Me’.
('70', 77, 5, 17, 158784) A good Christian has to testify what he has experienced in his own life or as a result of his own observation.
('70', 77, 5, 18, 158895) We are not true as His followers, if we are not true witnesses of Christ.
('70', 77, 5, 19, 158969) He said: ‘Go and teach and help through the mists and lead them out into larger light.’
('70', 77, 6, 20, 159057) Deenabandhu Andrews here asked to be permitted to put forward a concordat.
('70', 77, 6, 21, 159132) He said: “There are fundamental differences between you and the missionaries, and yet you are the friend of missionaries.
('70', 77, 6, 22, 159254) But you feel that they are not playing the game.
('70', 77, 6, 23, 159303) You want the leaders of the Church to say: ‘We do not want to fish in troubled waters; we shall do nothing to imply that we are taking advantage of a peculiar situation that has arisen’.”
('70', 77, 7, 24, 159491) G. I do not think it is a matter which admits of any compromise at all.
('70', 77, 7, 25, 159563) It is a deeply religious problem and each should do what he likes.
('70', 77, 7, 26, 159630) If your conscience tells you that the present effort is your mission, you need not give any quarter to Hindu reformers.
('70', 77, 7, 27, 159750) I can simply state my belief that what the missionaries are doing today does not show spirituality 1.
('70', 77, 8, 28, 159852) 1 The talks reproduced above took place on the 13th.
('70', 77, 8, 29, 159905) What follows is a report of the talk on the 14th.
('70', 78, 0, 1, 159955) VOL. 70: 21 OCT0BER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 79
('70', 78, 1, 2, 160002) J. M. What are the governing ideals and aims of this Indian Village Industries movement?
('70', 78, 1, 3, 160091) What is the object of your settling down in this little village?
('70', 78, 2, 4, 160156) G. The immediate object of my stay in Segaon is to remove to the best of my ability the appalling ignorance, poverty and the still more appalling insanitation of the Indian villages.
('70', 78, 2, 5, 160339) All these really run into one another.
('70', 78, 2, 6, 160378) We seek to remove ignorance not through imparting the knowledge of the alphabet by word of mouth, but by giving them object lessons in sanitation, by telling them what is happening in the world, and so on.
('70', 78, 3, 7, 160584) J. M. What you are doing here has great industrial significance.
('70', 78, 3, 8, 160649) Japan with about as high a rate of literacy as any country in the world is not exempt from the sins of industrialism.
('70', 78, 4, 9, 160767) G. But I am not seeking to industrialize the village.
('70', 78, 4, 10, 160821) I want to revive the village after the ancient pattern, i.
('70', 78, 4, 11, 160880) e., to revive hand spinning, hand ginning, and its other vital handicrafts.
('70', 78, 4, 12, 160956) The village uplift movement is an offshoot of the spinning movement.
('70', 78, 4, 13, 161025) So great was my ignorance in 1908 that I mixed up the spinning wheel with the loom in my small book on Indian Home Rule 1.
('70', 78, 5, 14, 161148) J. M. What is the cause of your greatest concern, your heaviest burden?
('70', 78, 6, 15, 161220) G. My greatest worry is the ignorance and poverty of the masses of India, and the way in which they have been neglected by the classes, especially the neglect of the Harijans by the Hindus.
('70', 78, 6, 16, 161410) This criminal neglect is unwarranted by any of the scriptures.
('70', 78, 6, 17, 161473) We are custodians of a great religion and yet we have been guilty of a crime which constitutes our greatest shame.
('70', 78, 6, 18, 161588) Had I not been a believer in the inscrutable ways of Providence, a sensitive man like me would have been a raving maniac.
('70', 78, 7, 19, 161710) J. M. What affords you the greatest hope and satisfaction?
('70', 78, 8, 20, 161769) G. Faith in myself born of faith in God.
('70', 78, 9, 21, 161810) J. M. In moments when your heart may sink within you, you hark back to this faith in God?
('70', 78, 10, 22, 161900) G. Yes.
('70', 78, 10, 23, 161908) That is why I have always described myself as an irrepressible optimist.
('70', 78, 11, 24, 161981) J. M. So am I .
('70', 78, 11, 25, 161997) Our difficulties are our salvation.
('70', 78, 11, 26, 162033) They make us hark back to the living God.
('70', 78, 12, 27, 162075) G. Yes.
('70', 78, 12, 28, 162083) My difficulties have strengthened my faith which rises superior to every difficulty, and remains undimmed.
('70', 78, 12, 29, 162190) My darkest hour
('70', 78, 13, 30, 162206) 1 Hind Swaraj, which, however, was written in 1909 and not in 1908
('70', 79, 0, 1, 162273) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 80
('70', 79, 1, 2, 162314) was when I was in Bombay a few months ago 1. It was the hour of my temptation.
('70', 79, 1, 3, 162393) Whilst I was asleep I suddenly felt as though I wanted to see a woman.
('70', 79, 1, 4, 162464) Well a man who had tried to rise superior to the sex instinct for nearly 40 years was bound to be intensely pained when he had this frightful experience.
('70', 79, 1, 5, 162618) I ultimately conquered the feeling, but I was face to face with the blackest moment of my life and if I had succumbed to it, it would have meant my absolute undoing.
('70', 79, 1, 6, 162784) I was stirred to the depths because strength and peace come from a life of continence.
('70', 79, 1, 7, 162871) Many Christian friends are jealous of the peace I possess.
('70', 79, 1, 8, 162930) It comes from God who has blessed me with the strength to battle against temptation.
('70', 79, 2, 9, 163015) J. M. I agree.
('70', 79, 2, 10, 163030) ‘Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.’
('70', 79, 3, 11, 163087) The talk now was switched on to subjects vastly different—those of current politics and other subjects.
('70', 79, 3, 12, 163191) But Gandhiji would not allow a discussion on current politics in the columns of Harijan.
('70', 79, 3, 13, 163280) I am therefore reluctantly obliged to omit this very important part of the discussion.
('70', 79, 4, 14, 163367) J. M. If money is to be given to India, in what ways can it be wisely given without causing any harm?
('70', 79, 4, 15, 163469) Will money be of any value?
('70', 79, 5, 16, 163497) When money is given it can only do harm.
('70', 79, 5, 17, 163538) It has got to be earned when it is required.
('70', 79, 5, 18, 163583) I am convinced that the American and British money which has been voted for missionary societies has done more harm than good.
('70', 79, 5, 19, 163710) You cannot serve God and mammon both.
('70', 79, 5, 20, 163748) And my fear is that mammon has been sent to serve India and God has remained behind, with the result that He will one day have His vengeance.
('70', 79, 5, 21, 163890) When the American says, ‘I will serve you through money,’ I dread him.
('70', 79, 5, 22, 163961) I simply say to him: ‘Send us your engineers not to earn money but to give us the benefit of their scientific knowledge.
('70', 79, 6, 23, 164082) J. M. But money is stored up personality.
('70', 79, 6, 24, 164124) It can be badly used as well as well used.
('70', 79, 6, 25, 164167) Through money you can get the services of a good engineer.
('70', 79, 6, 26, 164226) But far more dangerous than money is human personality.
('70', 79, 6, 27, 164282) It makes possible the good as well as the bad use of money.
('70', 79, 6, 28, 164342) Kagawa of Japan admits the use of money and machinery is attended with peril but insists, and I agree with him, that Christ is able to dominate both the money and the machine.
('70', 79, 7, 29, 164518) G. I have made the distinction between money given and money earned.
('70', 79, 7, 30, 164587) If an American says he wants to serve India, and you packed

('70', 80, 1, 2, 164798) him off here, I should say we had not earned his services.
('70', 80, 1, 3, 164857) But take Pierre Ceresole who came at his own expense, but after our consent, to serve earthquake stricken Bihar.
('70', 80, 1, 4, 164970) We would love to have as many Ceresoles as could possibly come to our help.
('70', 80, 1, 5, 165046) It is my certain conviction based on experience that money plays the least part in matters of spirit.
('70', 80, 2, 6, 165148) J. M. If money is the root of evil, we are living in a time when there is more money than ever was before.
('70', 80, 3, 7, 165255) G. Which means that there is more evil in the world.
('70', 80, 4, 8, 165308) J. M. This makes it supermely important that we study more profoundly than ever how to dominate this power both among the rich and the poor with spiritual purpose, motive and passion .
('70', 80, 5, 9, 165493) The greatest thing you have ever done is the observance of your Monday silence.
('70', 80, 5, 10, 165573) You illustrate thereby the storing up and releasing of power when needed.
('70', 80, 5, 11, 165647) What place has it continued to have in the preparation of your spiritual tasks?
('70', 80, 6, 12, 165727) G. It is not the greatest thing I have done, but it certainly means a great thing to me.
('70', 80, 6, 13, 165816) I am now taking silence almost every day.
('70', 80, 6, 14, 165858) If I could impose on myself silence for more days in the week than one I should love it.
('70', 80, 6, 15, 165947) In Yeravda Jail I once observed a 15 days’ silence.
('70', 80, 6, 16, 165999) I was in the seventh heaven during that period.
('70', 80, 6, 17, 166047) But this silence is now being utilized to get through arrears of work.
('70', 80, 6, 18, 166118) It is a superficial advantage after all.
('70', 80, 6, 19, 166159) The real silence should not be interrupted even by writing notes to others and carrying on conversation through them.
('70', 80, 6, 20, 166277) The notes interrupt the sacredness of the silence when you should listen to the music of the spheres.
('70', 80, 6, 21, 166379) That is why I often say that my silence is a fraud.

('70', 83, 3, 4, 169490) SHRILAL, I have gone through your letter carefully.

('70', 83, 3, 6, 169627) I do like your writing.

('70', 83, 3, 8, 169700) 1 find the way out.
('70', 83, 3, 9, 169720) For the present do not insist on carrying on without a servant.
('70', 83, 3, 10, 169784) It facilitates things if we treat a servant not as a servant but as a companion and we get the desired help immediately.
('70', 83, 3, 11, 169905) It takes time and unnecessary expenditure for half baked, burdened and weak persons like us to find companions.
('70', 83, 3, 12, 170017) I on my part keep gathering such persons round me and if I do not have them, then I will have no one for my experiments.
('70', 83, 3, 13, 170138) Now about the women.
('70', 83, 3, 14, 170159) I would prefer husbands and wives.
('70', 83, 3, 15, 170194) I believe that women can make their full contribution.
('70', 83, 3, 16, 170249) But I feel that if a woman only goes on bearing children, she will not be able to do anything else.
('70', 83, 3, 17, 170349) My idea of married brahmacharya was born out of these kinds of difficulties.
('70', 83, 3, 18, 170426) If your group believes in the present methods of birth control, then it is obvious to me that you are on the way to ruin.
('70', 83, 3, 19, 170548) Moreover, a woman is not as well trained and educated as her husband.

('70', 84, 3, 5, 171314) Oil may be used by those who can digest it.
('70', 84, 3, 6, 171358) But the quantity of milk should certainly be increased to make up for the lack of ghee.
('70', 84, 3, 7, 171446) With some effort pure ghee ought to be available.
('70', 84, 3, 8, 171496) In the matter of spices the attitude should be liberal.
('70', 84, 3, 9, 171552) Students should go only as far as they can.
('70', 84, 3, 10, 171596) Give them black pepper if it seems necessary, even green chillies if they are habituated to them.
('70', 84, 3, 11, 171694) But the value of simple pure food should be explained to them and they should go as far as they can in the matter.
('70', 84, 3, 12, 171809) It would be best for the students to grind the flour themselves; it will be cheaper, too, in the end.

('70', 84, 9, 22, 172206) His bill was exorbitant.

('70', 84, 9, 25, 172324) In spite of having been told not to, he has sent the fruit again.

('70', 85, 1, 2, 172531) 90. AN EXAMPLE FOR HINDU PRINCES AND THEIR ADVISERS
('70', 85, 2, 3, 172583) [Before November 16, 1936] 1
('70', 85, 3, 4, 172612) The Travancore Durbar have earned the congratulations of the whole Hindu world and all thoughtful men by issuing the following proclamation:
('70', 85, 4, 5, 172753) Profoundly convinced of the truth and validity of our religion, believing that it is based on Divine guidance and on all comprehending toleration, knowing that in its practice it has throughout the centuries adapted itself to the need of the changing times, solicitous that none of our Hindu subjects should, be reason of birth, caste or community, be denied the consolation and solace of the Hindu faith, we have decided and hereby declare, ordain and command that, subject to such rules and conditions as may be laid down and imposed by us for preserving their proper atmosphere and maintaining their rituals and observances, there should henceforth be no restriction placed on any Hindu by birth or religion on entering or worshipping at temples controlled by us and our Government.
('70', 85, 4, 6, 173539) The action has been long overdue.
('70', 85, 4, 7, 173573) But better late than never.
('70', 85, 4, 8, 173601) It may be said without pride that the way for the great step was prepared by the gentle but persistent efforts of the Travancore branch of the Harijan Sevak Sangh headed by Shri K. Parameswaran Pillai.
('70', 85, 4, 9, 173803) The workers of the Sangh had awakened the conscience of the savarna Hindus who had sent numerous petitions to the Durbar praying for the opening of the State temples to Harijans on the same terms as they were to caste Hindus.
('70', 85, 4, 10, 174029) Untouchability, though an excrescence, has taken such hold of the Hindu world that whenever a Hindu breaks through it and declares against it, he excites admiration among reformers and becomes the object of fierce criticism from the orthodox.
('70', 85, 4, 11, 174272) This is much more so when the action is taken by one in high authority as H. H. the Maharaja of Travancore, an ancient orthodox Hindu State.
('70', 85, 4, 12, 174413) Let us hope all criticism will be hushed before this well thought out, deliberate act of piety and justice.
('70', 85, 4, 13, 174521) Let us hope, too, that no attempt will be made to whittle away the hard earned freedom of Harijans by hedging it round by any the least distinction between one Hindu and another.
('70', 85, 4, 14, 174700) If the proclamation
('70', 85, 5, 15, 174720) 1 Though this was first published in The Bombay Chronicle on November 17, it is clear from the following item that it was ready for release on the 16th.
('70', 86, 0, 1, 174873) VOL. 70: 21 OCT0BER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 87
('70', 86, 1, 2, 174920) means anything it means that in the temples conducted under the State aegis Harijans will offer worship precisely on the same terms as the highest caste Hindus so called.
('70', 86, 1, 3, 175091) In other words, in the house of God in Travancore henceforth there will be no distinction between man and man, there will be no Harijans and no high caste, all will be Harijans— children of God.
('70', 86, 1, 4, 175286) If these are not the implications of the great proclamation, it is nothing but a mere scrap of paper.
('70', 86, 1, 5, 175388) But we have no reason to doubt its sincerity or suspect any mental reservations.
('70', 86, 1, 6, 175469) Travancore has a large and important Christian community.
('70', 86, 1, 7, 175527) Christian missions are flirting with Harijans, rightly no doubt from their own standpoint, they are spending money on them and holding out hope of real freedom and equality of social status.
('70', 86, 1, 8, 175718) It is beside the present discussion that for Harijans there is no social equality, no real freedom anywhere except when it is first obtained in Hinduism.
('70', 86, 1, 9, 175872) I am not thinking of individuals.
('70', 86, 1, 10, 175906) I am thinking of the whole mass.
('70', 86, 1, 11, 175939) The latter are so intertwined with the other Hindus that unless they become brothers with them instead of remaining serfs which they are, no change of label can avail anything.
('70', 86, 1, 12, 176116) But this apart, let us realize that the working of the proclamation will be narrowly watched and criticized by the sister communities.
('70', 86, 1, 13, 176251) It therefore behoves the State authorities as well as the caste Hindus to give full effect to the letter and the spirit of the proclamation.
('70', 86, 1, 14, 176392) The main duty of working the proclamation, however, devolves in a way upon the reformers and Harijans.
('70', 86, 1, 15, 176495) They should avail themselves of the freedom in a religious, becoming and humble spirit.
('70', 86, 1, 16, 176583) Reformers should see to it that Harijans enter these temples after proper ablutions and in a clean condition.
('70', 86, 1, 17, 176693) I know that this primary rule is observed more in the breach than in the performance by the vast majority of temple going caste Hindus.
('70', 86, 1, 18, 176829) Harijans may not copy the bad manners of caste Hindus.
('70', 86, 1, 19, 176884) They should take pride in setting a good example in cleanliness both of body and heart.
('70', 86, 1, 20, 176972) The proclamation should have no political significance, as it has none.
('70', 86, 1, 21, 177044) I regard it as the performance of a purely religious duty by the State.
('70', 86, 1, 22, 177116) And it should be so taken and so treated by all the Hindus of the State.
('70', 86, 1, 23, 177189) To give it any other colour will be to destroy its great spiritual purpose and effect.
('70', 86, 1, 24, 177276) Let us hope that the example of Travancore will prove infectious and all the othere Hindu States will follow suit.
('70', 86, 1, 25, 177391) There is no reason why they should not.
('70', 86, 1, 26, 177431) It is the privilege and duty of a Hindu prince to
('70', 87, 0, 1, 177481) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 88
('70', 87, 1, 2, 177522) propound religious codes which are not inconsistent with the fundamental principles of Hinduism as derived from the Vedas and which are demanded by the spirit of the times.
('70', 87, 1, 3, 177695) This must be true of all the progressive and living religions.
('70', 87, 1, 4, 177758) This rule accounts for apparent inconsistencies of the different smritis and also obvious departures from the original tenets as even a careless student will detect even in the same smriti.
('70', 87, 1, 5, 177948) If the Hindu princes do not perform this primary function, it is not so much their fault as of the lost Brahminhood.
('70', 87, 1, 6, 178065) If the Brahminical spirit was restored, princes would be rishis, who would take from the revenues the honest minimum necessary to support them as a commission for their labours on behalf of the ryots, and hold their revenue in trust for the ryots.
('70', 87, 1, 7, 178313) They would not have private property as they possess today and feel independent of their ryots and their wishes.
('70', 87, 1, 8, 178426) But whether we reach the ideal state outlined here during the present generation or ever, surely there is nothing to prevent the Hindu princes from following the example set by Travancore, and thus hastening the day of the total removal of untouchability from Hinduism, and helping to save it from certain destruction.
('70', 87, 1, 9, 178745) I would advise the responsible Hindus in every Hindu State to approach their princes and their advisers to initiate the overdue reform.

('70', 88, 3, 4, 179368) NARANDAS,
('70', 88, 4, 5, 179378) I am enclosing Prema’s letter.
('70', 88, 4, 6, 179409) Keshu has sent me your letter to him.
('70', 88, 4, 7, 179447) Do you believe that Lakshmidas is unjust to him?
('70', 88, 4, 8, 179496) Can Keshu acquire a patent in his indivdual capacity?
('70', 88, 4, 9, 179550) Isn’t what Lakshmidas writes of Arjun correct?
('70', 88, 4, 10, 179597) Is Lakshmidas jealous of you or Keshu?
('70', 88, 4, 11, 179636) Is he partial?
('70', 88, 4, 12, 179651) Which are the special points about Keshu’s machine?
('70', 88, 4, 13, 179703) Has he stolen any points from the machine which Lakshmidas has made?
('70', 88, 4, 14, 179772) I have come to believe that Keshu is prejudiced against Lakshmidas.
('70', 88, 4, 15, 179840) Please throw whatever light you can on the matter.

('70', 88, 10, 23, 180076) Consider this as a footnote to Lilavati’s letter.
('70', 88, 10, 24, 180126) Kanaiyo is happy here.
('70', 88, 10, 25, 180149) He has taken upon himself a big job.
('70', 88, 10, 26, 180186) If he sticks to it his life will certainly be rewarded.
('70', 88, 10, 27, 180242) Jamna 1 should not pester him for coming there.

('70', 89, 4, 7, 180562) You must obtain permission to come here for improving your health.

('70', 89, 10, 23, 181107) Nevertheless if I am asked, I say what I feel.
('70', 89, 10, 24, 181154) Here everyone believes that proposing Vallabhbhai’s name will not be proper.
('70', 89, 10, 25, 181231) There would be no difficulty at all if Rajaji were agreeable.
('70', 89, 10, 26, 181293) There is already talk of having Rajendra Babu for a second term.
('70', 89, 10, 27, 181358) I am not particular about anyone.
('70', 89, 10, 28, 181392) When I suggested Jawaharlal’s name, I had only the country’s good in mind.

('70', 90, 4, 5, 181897) I saw Prabha in Benares.
('70', 90, 4, 6, 181922) It gave me much pain to see that she had become very weak.
('70', 90, 4, 7, 181981) She appeared to be in a much worse condition than before.

('70', 90, 10, 16, 182306) But for whom is it Diwali?
('70', 90, 10, 17, 182333) You have a Holi burning there.
('70', 90, 10, 18, 182364) Who can remain untouched by its sparks?
('70', 90, 10, 19, 182404) How is Jijima?
('70', 90, 10, 20, 182419) Her illness has been prolonged.
('70', 90, 10, 21, 182451) It is better that we get along with the appointment of the Constitution Committee.
('70', 90, 10, 22, 182534) It would serve us well if the work begins.

('70', 91, 2, 3, 182887) SEGAON, November 17, 1936 CHI.
('70', 91, 2, 4, 182918) AMRITLAL, I got your letter after Vasumati had left.
('70', 91, 2, 5, 182971) So the address for the information of the relatives could not be given.
('70', 91, 2, 6, 183043) I am sending Kanu your address.
('70', 91, 2, 7, 183075) Among other fruits are pomegranate, custard apple, pineapple, jambu, sweet guavas, mangoes, fully ripe rayan, sweet berries, etc.
('70', 91, 2, 8, 183205) There is no harm in taking bananas occasionally.
('70', 91, 2, 9, 183254) But it is better to take them in place of rotli.
('70', 91, 2, 10, 183303) You may wash them and add butter or ghee.
('70', 91, 2, 11, 183345) It is possible that some of these fruits may not suit you as the apples did not.
('70', 91, 2, 12, 183426) You should give up such fruits.
('70', 91, 2, 13, 183458) I follow the point about soap.
('70', 91, 2, 14, 183489) Chhotelal says that even soap powder is more expensive than the soap made at Maganwadi.
('70', 91, 2, 15, 183577) Can you say anything on this matter?
('70', 91, 2, 16, 183614) You are gaining weight satisfactorily.
('70', 91, 2, 17, 183653) It should go on.
('70', 91, 2, 18, 183670) See that you do not have the slightest indigestion.
('70', 91, 2, 19, 183722) Mirabehn is also recouping her health and she does not feel tired while walking.
('70', 91, 2, 20, 183803) She does some work also.
('70', 91, 2, 21, 183828) Although sometimes she does transgress the limit.
('70', 91, 2, 22, 183878) One day she even had fever.
('70', 91, 2, 23, 183906) I was scared and so was she.
('70', 91, 2, 24, 183935) She took almost nothing on that day and remained on honey, water and lemon juice and was well again.
('70', 91, 2, 25, 184036) Amtul Salaam lives at Santa Cruz.
('70', 91, 2, 26, 184070) Do go there.
('70', 91, 2, 27, 184083) The address is Easter Villa, 7th Road.
('70', 91, 2, 28, 184122) See Kanti if you can.
('70', 91, 2, 29, 184144) Your recipe for making gruel is correct.
('70', 91, 2, 30, 184185) No lumps will form even if you put paste of flour made in cold water into the boiling water.
('70', 91, 2, 31, 184278) I had made gruel for 75 prisoners at a time by this method.
('70', 91, 2, 32, 184338) It cooks in a very short time.
('70', 91, 2, 33, 184369) It takes quite a long time if we put the cold mixture on the fire and it requires stirring continuously.
('70', 91, 2, 34, 184474) Do you understand what I write?
('70', 91, 2, 35, 184506) I hope you do.
('70', 91, 2, 36, 184521) You must pour into boiling water the thick paste of flour, stirring the while.
('70', 91, 2, 37, 184600) The intake of milk should be up to 120 tolas.
('70', 91, 2, 38, 184646) Make a habit of taking lemons.
('70', 91, 2, 39, 184677) There is nothing about Harilal in the newspapers.
('70', 91, 2, 40, 184727) I do wish to know, however, what he said on the occasion, where it was and what happened there, and so on.

('70', 92, 3, 4, 185123) RAMDAS,
('70', 92, 4, 5, 185131) Why, indeed, need you write to me.
('70', 92, 4, 6, 185166) Kanu is fine.
('70', 92, 4, 7, 185180) As l am writing this, he is cycling about.
('70', 92, 4, 8, 185223) He eats quite well.
('70', 92, 4, 9, 185243) He accompanies me on my evening walks.
('70', 92, 4, 10, 185282) He is still coughing a little.
('70', 92, 4, 11, 185313) Everybody says that Nimu has very badly gone down in health.
('70', 92, 4, 12, 185374) If finally she does not keep well, send her over to me.
('70', 92, 4, 13, 185430) Let her go to Lakhtar if she so wishes.
('70', 92, 4, 14, 185470) Or, she may go to Sabarmati.
('70', 92, 4, 15, 185499) You ought to observe regular eating habits.
('70', 92, 4, 16, 185543) If you all constantly fall ill, it would be too great a price to pay for living in Bombay.
('70', 92, 4, 17, 185634) I do wish that you should not pay such a price.
('70', 92, 4, 18, 185682) What came of your plan for a store?
('70', 92, 4, 19, 185718) Ba keeps worrying a good deal on your account.
('70', 92, 4, 20, 185765) Have you discovered the meaning of the mystery of Harilal’s new change?
('70', 92, 4, 21, 185837) 1 The papers are keeping completely quiet about it.

('70', 92, 10, 27, 186075) So after all you did fall ill there!
('70', 92, 10, 28, 186112) But then, are you so ill that you cannot even write?
('70', 92, 10, 29, 186165) Ba worries so much.
('70', 92, 10, 30, 186185) You went there to look after Ramdas, to see that he gets his meals at the appointed hours and to share in his work, but Ba tells me that you have become so weak that Ramdas has to prepare his morning meal himself.
('70', 92, 10, 31, 186399) Of course there is nothing wrong in it.
('70', 92, 10, 32, 186439) But these days, Ramdas too, is a cripple.
('70', 92, 10, 33, 186481) Now, you two may do what you deem best.
('70', 92, 10, 34, 186521) It will be well if you come over here or go either to Sabarmati or Lakhtar.
('70', 92, 10, 35, 186597) Do whatever you like but
('70', 92, 11, 36, 186622) 1 Harilal had embraced Islam about May 14 of the year and then changed over to Arya Samaj about 12th November.

('70', 93, 5, 9, 187031) SEGAON, WARDHA, November 17/19, 1936
('70', 93, 7, 10, 187068) I would of course be glad if you insist on writing to me only a postcard every week.
('70', 93, 7, 11, 187153) I do not wish to disturb you at all in your studies.
('70', 93, 7, 12, 187206) I wrote the above the day before yesterday and then there was an interruption.
('70', 93, 7, 13, 187285) Nor do I wish to waste even a moment of your time.
('70', 93, 7, 14, 187336) However, I do not regard five minutes given to me every week an unnecessary waste of time.
('70', 93, 7, 15, 187427) I very often think of writing to you but fail to find the time.
('70', 93, 7, 16, 187491) Amtul Salaam writes much about you and sends messages but I write nothing of it to you.
('70', 93, 7, 17, 187579) I write this on purpose.
('70', 93, 7, 18, 187604) Sardar told me that you had been to Harilal and there you saw such a tragic sight that you could not coutrol your tears and wept and came away.
('70', 93, 7, 19, 187748) How will you help me by keeping unhappiness from me?
('70', 93, 7, 20, 187801) I must learn to endure unhappiness and get used to it.
('70', 93, 7, 21, 187856) Write to me, therefore, all that happened there.
('70', 93, 7, 22, 187905) Also tell me what that Arya Samaj business was.
('70', 93, 7, 23, 187953) Is there any truth in it?
('70', 93, 7, 24, 187979) Does anyone look after him?
('70', 93, 7, 25, 188007) I put these questions to you because you still take interest in Harilal.
('70', 93, 7, 26, 188080) How are things with you?

('70', 94, 2, 3, 188268) MY DEAR IDIOT, I write never to make you weep but always to make you laugh.
('70', 94, 2, 4, 188344) After your letter I realized the meaning you gave to your previous letter.
('70', 94, 2, 5, 188419) At the same time your paragraph did bear the meaning I put upon it.
('70', 94, 2, 6, 188487) But why should my play make you weep?
('70', 94, 2, 7, 188525) Why don’t you weep over the many choice adjectives I apply to you?
('70', 94, 2, 8, 188592) You must develop a thick skin, if you will be well, both physically and mentally, and will take up the task for which you seem to be cut out.
('70', 94, 2, 9, 188734) I am not going to Faizpur on 1st December but I may on 10th or 11th, certainly about 20th.
('70', 94, 2, 10, 188825) If you come after 27th it will be very late.
('70', 94, 2, 11, 188870) Why not come earlier and go from there to Ahmedabad.
('70', 94, 2, 12, 188923) Then you may be a little late, if you like.
('70', 94, 2, 13, 188967) But you will see what is possible.
('70', 94, 2, 14, 189002) I am not touring after the Congress.
('70', 94, 2, 15, 189039) My destination is Segaon.
('70', 94, 2, 16, 189065) I shall have to go to Belgaum in March or April, whenever Gandhi Seva Sangh meets.
('70', 94, 2, 17, 189148) This gives you all the information you need and ask for.
('70', 94, 2, 18, 189205) The session begins on 27th and ends 29th.
('70', 94, 2, 19, 189247) I shall certainly read your article if it comes to me in time for suggestions.

('70', 94, 6, 23, 189426) November 19, 1936
('70', 94, 7, 24, 189444) PREMA, There was nothing in your previous letter which called for a reply.
('70', 94, 7, 25, 189519) I would welcome any pretext for writing to you.
('70', 94, 7, 26, 189567) But I had no time at all.
('70', 94, 7, 27, 189593) I must, however, reply to your last letter.
('70', 94, 7, 28, 189637) Kaka had told me about your illness in the course of a minute’s conversation, but I did not know that it was as serious as you describe it to be.
('70', 94, 7, 29, 189783) How did you manage to fall ill like that?
('70', 94, 7, 30, 189825) I see your carelessness in this.
('70', 94, 7, 31, 189858) If you looked upon your body as a trust from God and used it accordingly, you would not fall ill as you did.
('70', 94, 7, 32, 189967) Why don’t you content yourself with what you can do within the limits of your strength?
('70', 95, 0, 1, 190055) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 96
('70', 95, 1, 2, 190096) I have no plan of camping there from December 1 or of starting on a tour in January.
('70', 95, 1, 3, 190181) Yes, I should certainly like to go to Faizpur before the Exhibition starts.
('70', 95, 2, 4, 190257) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] Lilavati has returned to Segaon.
('70', 95, 2, 5, 190316) She is unpredictable.
('70', 95, 2, 6, 190338) Her aspirations are no doubt high.
('70', 95, 2, 7, 190373) She works hard, too.
('70', 95, 2, 8, 190394) But she will make no real progress until she overcomes her impatience.
('70', 95, 2, 9, 190465) Still, if I do not give up hope of swaraj why should I give up hope of Lilavati?
('70', 95, 2, 10, 190546) It will be difficult for you to find another optimist like me.
('70', 95, 2, 11, 190609) Has not Harilal fallen into a deep pit?
('70', 95, 2, 12, 190649) But I have not given up hope even about him.
('70', 95, 2, 13, 190694) What more can I say?
('70', 95, 2, 14, 190715) Becoming an Arya Samajist means nothing.

('70', 95, 7, 18, 190897) BHAI DAHYABHAI,
('70', 95, 8, 19, 190913) I have your letter.
('70', 95, 8, 20, 190933) The picture of you sitting in front of me is still vivid before my eyes.
('70', 95, 8, 21, 191006) How helpless I am!
('70', 95, 8, 22, 191025) I was so hard pressed for time that I did not even dare to ask you how you were.
('70', 95, 8, 23, 191106) I wanted to save every moment of my time and every particle of my energy.

('70', 96, 3, 4, 191403) RAOJIBHAI,
('70', 96, 4, 5, 191414) I have your letter.
('70', 96, 4, 6, 191434) I wish your Conference success.
('70', 96, 4, 7, 191466) The yardstick of success is not resolutions however grand but firm follow up action on the part of the youth.
('70', 96, 4, 8, 191576) They should not pass any resolution which they are not prepared to implement.

('70', 96, 8, 12, 191845) November 19, 1936
('70', 96, 9, 13, 191863) BHAI RAMNARAYAN,
('70', 96, 10, 14, 191880) Your first statement is not an indication of truth.
('70', 96, 10, 15, 191932) It fails to incorporate many points that should have been there.
('70', 96, 10, 16, 191997) Even my opinion has not been quoted correctly.
('70', 96, 10, 17, 192044) How can a person ignorant of the background understand it?
('70', 96, 10, 18, 192103) I have to join issue with you, should I not, when you do not accept my opinion and at the same time publish it?
('70', 96, 10, 19, 192215) If you wish, you may publish your second statement.
('70', 96, 10, 20, 192267) However, you need not do anything under pressure from me.
('70', 96, 10, 21, 192325) Write and do only what your mind and your heart permit.
('70', 96, 10, 22, 192381) I expect nothing more than that you will weigh calmly the words of one like me.
('70', 96, 10, 23, 192461) It is not up to me to forsake or ignore you.
('70', 96, 10, 24, 192506) To the end of my life I shall hope, as I do in the case of Harilal, that you will be reformed.
('70', 96, 10, 25, 192601) To me Narmada’s staying in Jyoti Sangh, her being considered a pious woman, your staying near her and other things are like branding one who has already burnt himself.
('70', 96, 10, 26, 192769) I do not know what kind of morality you accept.
('70', 96, 10, 27, 192817) Probably you do not find any immorality in your conduct and therefore my simile would hurt you as everything I say hurts Harilal.
('70', 96, 10, 28, 192947) However, there is no other way before me to awaken
('70', 97, 0, 1, 192998) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 98
('70', 97, 1, 2, 193039) either him or you.
('70', 97, 1, 3, 193058) I do not know you but I do know Narmada a little.
('70', 97, 1, 4, 193108) She is a foolish girl and has very little understanding.
('70', 97, 1, 5, 193165) She is ignorant of truth and untruth.
('70', 97, 1, 6, 193203) Any young man can mislead her.
('70', 97, 1, 7, 193234) You became her husband instead of being a brother or father to her and did obvious injustice to Ganga.
('70', 97, 1, 8, 193337) Narmada could not even stand the talk she had with me before leaving.
('70', 97, 1, 9, 193407) I keep on receiving laments from your brother, Ganga and Hemubhai.
('70', 97, 1, 10, 193474) It is terrible if all that they write is true.
('70', 97, 1, 11, 193521) And if it is—and from what you yourself write it seems to be— one shouldn’t be surprised if you were playing false with them.
('70', 97, 1, 12, 193647) I know young men who feel satisfied that they have done their duty when they partially acknowledge their sins and if other people are not satisfied with it they get angry.
('70', 97, 1, 13, 193819) They think that society is ungrateful to them.
('70', 97, 1, 14, 193866) I wish you would not make such a mistake.
('70', 97, 1, 15, 193908) Believe it that whatever I have written is for your good and for your guidance.
('70', 97, 1, 16, 193988) You may forsake me but I do not forsake myself.
('70', 97, 1, 17, 194036) So how can I do that with you or anyone else?
('70', 97, 1, 18, 194082) 1 is not only a scriptural statement; it has been woven into my life.
('70', 97, 2, 19, 194152) Blessings from BAPU

('70', 97, 7, 23, 194301) I have been terribly behind hand in my correspondence.
('70', 97, 7, 24, 194356) No time unless I would work outside the permitted hours.
('70', 97, 7, 25, 194413) But I won’t.
('70', 97, 7, 26, 194426) How long that ‘won’t’ will last remains to be seen.
('70', 97, 7, 27, 194478) I hardly think Maria’s 2 case will apply to you.
('70', 97, 7, 28, 194527) But no one knows what may happen.
('70', 97, 7, 29, 194561) About return passage I shall try.
('70', 97, 7, 30, 194595) I do not want you to collect in London for the A.I.V.I.A. I suppose you have Indians in mind.
('70', 97, 7, 31, 194689) It is no use your going to them with the beggar’s bowl even for Daridranarayana.

('70', 98, 1, 3, 194949) I do not think you need to thank donors who give through agencies like me.
('70', 98, 1, 4, 195024) I do not at all like the idea of your earning anything by giving takli lessons unless they are given to some rich people who want to learn takli spinning as a hobby.
('70', 98, 1, 5, 195190) I would far rather supply your small wants from other sources.
('70', 98, 1, 6, 195253) My policy of not asking or expecting friends of the West to join any C.D. movement still abides.
('70', 98, 1, 7, 195350) They can do much by doing what I call constructive work on behalf of A.I.S.A., A.I.V.I.A. and the like.
('70', 98, 1, 8, 195454) Now I think I have answered all your questions.

('70', 100, 1, 2, 197471) 112. SEX EDUCATION 1
('70', 100, 2, 3, 197492) Maganbhai Desai, who received the other day the degree equivalent to Master of Arts from the Gujarat Vidyapith, wrote to me a Gujarati letter dated 7th October from which I cull the following: 2
('70', 100, 3, 4, 197687) May I invite you to discuss in the columns of Harijanbandhu a question which you have so far left more or less untouched, I mean the question of imparting sex instruction to young people?
('70', 100, 4, 5, 197875) Should sex education be included in the educational curricula of our children?
('70', 100, 4, 6, 197954) Who should impart it?
('70', 100, 4, 7, 197976) What would be the necessary qualification for the task?
('70', 100, 4, 8, 198032) Should this subject be taught in a matter of fact manner to all and sundry just like geography or arithmetic?
('70', 100, 4, 9, 198142) Or is there any limit?
('70', 100, 4, 10, 198165) And if so, who is to draw the line and where?
('70', 100, 4, 11, 198211) Again, should the aim of sex education be to combat the onset of libido or simply to recognize it as an inevitable fact of nature which has to be accepted and submitted to?
('70', 100, 5, 12, 198384) May I also take leave to make a special request in this connection?
('70', 100, 5, 13, 198452) Apart from what you may write on this subject in English, won’t you write something for the Gujarati reader in Gujarati?
('70', 100, 5, 14, 198573) You know it is an old standing grievance of ours that you have ceased to give your original contributions in Gujarati.
('70', 100, 6, 15, 198692) I kept this letter for such a long time hoping that one day I should write something on the subject discussed in it.
('70', 100, 6, 16, 198809) Meanwhile I had to go to Ahmedabad to preside at the Twelfth Gujarati Sahitya Parishad 3. During my stay of four days at the Vidyapith and in course of contact with Gujarati men and women there, past incidents came afresh to me.
('70', 100, 6, 17, 199038) I was confronted by the man who had gently castigated me in the above mentioned letter.
('70', 100, 6, 18, 199126) He even asked me, “What about that letter?” I pacified him by saying that I was carrying it everywhere with me and that I would definitely write about it.
('70', 100, 6, 19, 199281) At that time I wanted to write in English.
('70', 100, 6, 20, 199324) On reaching Segaon, I felt the impact of Maganbhai’s castigation.
('70', 100, 6, 21, 199390) I was reminded of the bitter but affectionate
('70', 100, 7, 22, 199436) 1 Translated from Gujarati by Pyarelal.
('70', 100, 7, 23, 199476) The original appeared in Harijanbandhu, 22 11 1936. 2 Only extracts have been reproduced here.

('70', 101, 1, 2, 199772) quarrel with Swami Anand in the days of Navajivan.
('70', 101, 1, 3, 199823) He could not bear that I should contribute my original ideas to Young India while only stale versions should go to Navajivan.
('70', 101, 1, 4, 199949) I also felt the same.
('70', 101, 1, 5, 199971) Yet my insistence on writing in Young India was not out of place.
('70', 101, 1, 6, 200037) I think at long last Swami Anand got tired and stopped troubling me.
('70', 101, 1, 7, 200106) Even after the lapse of such a long time I cannot say definitely which of us two was right.
('70', 101, 1, 8, 200198) Be it as it may, having said this much by way of introduction I wish to tell the readers of Harijanbandhu that I fully agree with Shri Maganbhai’s complaint.
('70', 101, 1, 9, 200356) And from now onwards, every week I will try to give something new to the Gujarati readers.
('70', 101, 1, 10, 200447) I appeal to them to encourage me in my effort.
('70', 101, 2, 11, 200494) Preoccupation with sex is daily becoming more marked in Gujarat as in the rest of India.
('70', 101, 2, 12, 200583) And what is more, those who fall under its sway feel as if there is something meritorious about it.
('70', 101, 2, 13, 200683) When a slave begins to take pride in his fetters and hugs them like precious ornaments, the triumph of the slave owner is complete.
('70', 101, 2, 14, 200815) But this success of Cupid, spectacular though it may be, will, I am convinced, prove to be short lived and ignoble, and at long last end in inanition even like a scorpion whose venom is spent.
('70', 101, 2, 15, 201008) But that does not mean that we can in the meantime afford to sit with folded hands.
('70', 101, 2, 16, 201092) The certainty of its defeat need not, must not, lull us into a false sense of security.
('70', 101, 2, 17, 201180) The conquest of lust is the highest endeavour of a man’s or a woman’s existence.
('70', 101, 2, 18, 201261) Without overcoming lust man cannot hope to rule over self.
('70', 101, 2, 19, 201320) And without rule over self there can be no swaraj or Ramarajya.
('70', 101, 2, 20, 201384) Rule of all without rule of oneself would prove to be as deceptive and disappointing as a painted toy mango, charming to look at outwardly but hollow and empty within.
('70', 101, 2, 21, 201552) No worker who has not overcome lust can hope to render any genuine service to the cause of Harijans, communal unity, khadi, cow protection or village reconstruction.
('70', 101, 2, 22, 201718) Great causes like these cannot be served by intellectual equipment alone, they call for spiritual effort or soul force.
('70', 101, 2, 23, 201838) Soul force comes only through God’s grace, and God’s grace never descends upon a man who is a slave to lust.
('70', 101, 2, 24, 201947) What place has then instruction in sexual science in our educational system, or has it any place there at all?
('70', 101, 2, 25, 202058) Sexual science is of two kinds, that which is used for controlling or overcoming the sexual passion and that which is used to stimulate and feed it.
('70', 101, 2, 26, 202207) Instruction in the former is as necessary a part of a child’s education
('70', 101, 3, 27, 202279) 1 This paragraph has been taken from Harijanbandhu.
('70', 102, 0, 1, 202331) VOL. 70: 21 OCT0BER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 103
('70', 102, 1, 2, 202379) as the latter is harmful and dangerous and fit therefore only to be shunned.
('70', 102, 1, 3, 202456) All great religions have rightly regarded Kama as the arch enemy of man, anger or hatred coming only in the second place.
('70', 102, 1, 4, 202578) According to the Gita, the latter is an offspring of the former.
('70', 102, 1, 5, 202643) The Gita of course uses the word kama in its wider sense of desire.
('70', 102, 1, 6, 202711) But the same holds good of the narrow sense in which it is used here.
('70', 102, 1, 7, 202781) This, however, still leaves unanswered the question, viz., whether it is desirable to impart to young pupils a knowledge about the use and function of generative organs.
('70', 102, 1, 8, 202951) It seems to me that it is necessary to impart such knowledge to a certain extent.
('70', 102, 1, 9, 203033) At present they are often left to pick up such knowledge anyhow, with the result that they are misled into abusive practices.
('70', 102, 1, 10, 203159) We cannot properly control or conquer the sexual passion by turning a blind eye to it.
('70', 102, 1, 11, 203246) I am therefore strongly in favour of teaching young boys and girls the significance and right use of their generative organs.
('70', 102, 1, 12, 203372) And in my own way I have tried to impart this knowledge to young children of both sexes for whose training I was responsible.
('70', 102, 1, 13, 203498) But the sex education that I stand for must have for its object the conquest and sublimation of the sex passion.
('70', 102, 1, 14, 203611) Such education should automatically serve to bring home to children the essential distinction between man and brute, to make them realize that it is man’s special privilege and pride to be gifted with the faculties of head and heart both; that he is a thinking, no less than a feeling, animal, as the very derivation of the word manushya shows, and to renounce the sovereignty of reason over the blind instincts is therefore to renounce a man’s estate.
('70', 102, 1, 15, 204064) In man reason quickens and guides the feeling, in brute the soul lies over dormant.
('70', 102, 1, 16, 204148) To awaken the heart is to awaken the dormant soul, to awaken reason, and to inculcate discrimination between good and evil.
('70', 102, 1, 17, 204272) Who should teach this true science of sex?
('70', 102, 1, 18, 204315) Clearly, he who has attained mastery over his passions.
('70', 102, 1, 19, 204371) To teach astronomy and kindred sciences we have teachers who have gone through a course of training in them and are masters of their art.
('70', 102, 1, 20, 204509) Even so must we have as teachers of sexual science, i.e., the science of sex control, those who have studied it and have acquired mastery over self.
('70', 102, 1, 21, 204658) Even a lofty utterance that has not the backing of sincerity and experience will be inert and lifeless, and will utterly fail to penetrate and quicken the hearts of men, while the speech that springs from self realization and genuine experience is always fruitful.
('70', 103, 0, 1, 204923) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 104
('70', 103, 1, 2, 204965) Today our entire environment—our reading, our thinking, our social behaviour—is generally calculated to subserve and cater for the sex urge.
('70', 103, 1, 3, 205106) To break through its coils is no easy task.
('70', 103, 1, 4, 205150) But it is a task worthy of our highest endeavour.
('70', 103, 1, 5, 205200) Even if there are a handful of teachers endowed with practical experience, who accept the ideal of attaining self control as the highest duty of man, are fired by a genuine and undying faith in their mission, and are sleeplessly vigilant and active, their labour will light the path of the children of Gujarat, save the unwary from falling into the mire of sexuality and rescue those who might be already engulfed in it.

('70', 103, 5, 10, 205779) The havoc caused by the terrible cyclone that burst over the coastal districts of Andhradesa, especially Guntur District, cannot be adequately measured in terms of money.
('70', 103, 5, 11, 205950) The official estimate is one crore of rupees.
('70', 103, 5, 12, 205996) I am writing this to you specially on behalf of Harijans who have been terribly hard hit.
('70', 103, 5, 13, 206086) Their plight is very pitiable and calls for prompt and adequate relief.
('70', 103, 5, 14, 206158) Over 3,000 weavers have lost homes and looms.
('70', 103, 5, 15, 206204) Fishermen on the coast, aboriginal tribes, Harijans and other Depressed Classes have lost their all— food, clothing and shelter .
('70', 103, 5, 16, 206334) .A sum of Rs. 25,000 is the bare minimum required to give them immediate relief .
('70', 103, 5, 17, 206416) Donations may be sent to Deshbhakta Konda Venkatapayya, Guntur.
('70', 103, 5, 18, 206480) I gladly publish this letter.
('70', 103, 5, 19, 206510) Calamities such as the one that has overtaken Guntur have become part of our life.
('70', 103, 5, 20, 206593) There is no doubt that philanthropists will be helping cyclone stricken people in Guntur, but the call of the Harijans affected by the cyclone required special emphasis, and I hope that those who are interested in Harijans will not fail to respond to this call.

('70', 104, 1, 4, 207258) He has not done so this time; and he knows too that there are grave allegations against him into which I am investiagating.

('70', 104, 12, 26, 208563) However, I shall be happy if you meet your own expenses.

('70', 105, 1, 4, 208993) Most probably there won’t be any need to bring the workers from there.
('70', 105, 1, 5, 209064) I will let you know if there is.

('70', 105, 7, 16, 209478) As for you, I have nothing to say.

('70', 105, 7, 18, 209602) Ramnarayan’s action has made me very unhappy 1. There have no doubt been such incidents but this was the limit.
('70', 105, 7, 19, 209714) The question is how our minds react to such incidents.
('70', 105, 7, 20, 209769) It is possible that my views are unsuited to the new mind.

('70', 105, 13, 28, 210069) Why should Mahadev keep back your letter from me?

('70', 105, 13, 30, 210186) Isn’t that so?
('70', 105, 13, 31, 210201) I too love them equally but there is a difference between the two of us.

('70', 106, 1, 3, 210454) For the time being it is enough for me to say that I have given due thought to what I have done and therefore we are not going to lose anything.
('70', 106, 1, 4, 210599) Do we ever prevent those who wish to say something or do more work?
('70', 106, 1, 5, 210667) A true celebration consists only in increasing our purity and other virtues.
('70', 106, 1, 6, 210744) The simile of the cow at that time 1 was quite appropriate.
('70', 106, 1, 7, 210804) It was not an insult to the Harijans.

('70', 106, 6, 19, 211301) Your duty is clear.
('70', 106, 6, 20, 211321) You should either engage yourself in some honest work to earn money or plunge into the field of service with a determined will.
('70', 106, 6, 21, 211449) If you do the latter you have to give up all hope of earning money.
('70', 106, 6, 22, 211517) You should be interested in service for the sake of service.
('70', 106, 6, 23, 211578) If it is not so it is hypocrisy, and what can be worse than that?
('70', 106, 6, 24, 211644) A father in law has been given the same status as a father in our religion.
('70', 106, 6, 25, 211720) Consult Shastriji, therefore, and do as he suggests.

('70', 108, 10, 15, 214404) You seem to be a pretty good reporter of news.
('70', 108, 10, 16, 214451) Your progress may be regarded fair.
('70', 108, 10, 17, 214487) No one can put on 5 lb.
('70', 108, 10, 18, 214511) in a week.
('70', 108, 10, 19, 214522) I shall be satisfied if henceforth you put on 2 lb.
('70', 108, 10, 20, 214574) every week.
('70', 108, 10, 21, 214586) Mirabehn’s diet at present is just the same as you have written.
('70', 108, 10, 22, 214651) Apples cure many persons of their constipation.
('70', 108, 10, 23, 214699) However every constitution has its own characteristics.
('70', 108, 10, 24, 214755) Formerly Mirabehn had no such thing as constipation.
('70', 108, 10, 25, 214808) I am the main cause of her illness, am I not?
('70', 108, 10, 26, 214854) Anyway, things are getting on well now at any rate.
('70', 108, 10, 27, 214906) Gur made from the date juice has been a complete success now.
('70', 108, 10, 28, 214968) The cause of the earlier failure seems to be the carelessness in applying lime to the earthen pot.
('70', 108, 10, 29, 215067) There is a scarcity of ghee here at present.
('70', 108, 10, 30, 215112) The number of bachelors has increased.
('70', 108, 10, 31, 215151) Now Balkrishna has joined them.
('70', 108, 10, 32, 215183) I shall definitely arrange to send ghee to you.
('70', 108, 10, 33, 215231) My method of making the gruel definitely saves time and there is no difficulty in cooking.
('70', 108, 10, 34, 215322) Some items need boiling water and some other should be put in cold water when being placed on the fire, for instance, potatoes.

('70', 109, 1, 3, 215575) But now I have received more information.
('70', 109, 1, 4, 215617) His condition is miserable.
('70', 109, 1, 5, 215645) There is no change in him at all.
('70', 109, 1, 6, 215679) He only needs money for liquor.
('70', 109, 1, 7, 215711) I understand about Kana.
('70', 109, 1, 8, 215736) Train him when you come here.
('70', 109, 1, 9, 215766) None of your letters are pending now.
('70', 109, 1, 10, 215804) Lilavati has taken over the charge of the kitchen and the accounts.

('70', 109, 5, 15, 216109) Now you will be coming here soon, so perhaps there won’t be any need for a letter.
('70', 109, 5, 16, 216192) If there is, let me know.
('70', 109, 5, 17, 216218) I am carrying on brisk correspondence about the leather.
('70', 109, 5, 18, 216275) You must see the correspondence even if nothing comes of it.
('70', 109, 5, 19, 216336) I shall get the news about the appeal by telegram tomorrow.
('70', 109, 6, 20, 216396) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] I have collected some village instruments which you will see.
('70', 109, 6, 21, 216484) They are no more to be found in the villages but of this later.

('70', 109, 10, 26, 216711) The Bhajan Mandali’s object is the same as yours.
('70', 109, 10, 27, 216761) But of course, you must arrange things as you want.
('70', 109, 10, 28, 216813) Both ways are good.

('70', 110, 2, 3, 216970) SEGAON, WARDHA, November 24, 1936
('70', 110, 3, 4, 217004) MY DEAR REBEL,
('70', 110, 4, 5, 217019) I am quite clear that women shold not seek favours from men.
('70', 110, 4, 6, 217080) Therefore the fittest should rely upon their being wanted for the parliamentary work.
('70', 110, 4, 7, 217166) I like the idea of some women at least declining to be on the reserved list.
('70', 110, 4, 8, 217243) Those who will come on the Congress ticket must sign the Congress pledge.
('70', 110, 4, 9, 217317) I do not know what is possible at this stage.
('70', 110, 4, 10, 217363) Dr. M. should have no difficulty if she would sign the pledge and if there is room for her.
('70', 110, 4, 11, 217455) But I know nothing of what is happening.
('70', 110, 4, 12, 217496) You have done well in writing to J.N. I think this covers all your questions on this head.
('70', 110, 4, 13, 217587) If not you will ask again.
('70', 110, 4, 14, 217614) Faizpur is 25 miles’ motor drive from Bhusaval and 7 from a station before B. I forget the name.
('70', 110, 4, 15, 217711) If you can start from J. 1 two days earlier, you can easily drop in at Faizpur.
('70', 110, 4, 16, 217791) You can even stay there two or three days if you can afford to leave J. earlier still.
('70', 110, 4, 17, 217878) I should not accept any fixtures in J. after 12th December.
('70', 110, 4, 18, 217938) You will watch my programme about that time and act accordingly.
('70', 110, 4, 19, 218003) I did ask Mrs. S. to withdraw but I do not remember whether she acted up to my advice.
('70', 110, 4, 20, 218090) Dr. M. should know.

('70', 110, 10, 26, 218245) I quite forgot your [letter].
('70', 110, 10, 27, 218275) Jamnalalji will no doubt contribute whatever he can afford.
('70', 110, 10, 28, 218335) If he asks for a note there is no harm in giving it.
('70', 110, 10, 29, 218388) However, tell him to consult me about the matter.
('70', 110, 10, 30, 218438) I had indeed opened an account for you but at the same time had instructed them not to harass you.

('70', 111, 1, 2, 218620) As for Diwali, I am not even aware of it.
('70', 111, 1, 3, 218662) The sentiment behind it has died out.
('70', 111, 1, 4, 218700) When there is a fire raging all around, how can there be a Diwali celebration?
('70', 111, 1, 5, 218779) As long as Harilal has not freed himself of his addiction, his conversion and reconversion can have no value.

('70', 111, 7, 12, 219086) BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
('70', 111, 8, 13, 219104) Nobody here shares your view.
('70', 111, 8, 14, 219134) Personally I liked Jawaharlal’s statement.
('70', 111, 8, 15, 219177) How could he have said less?
('70', 111, 8, 16, 219206) What more could we expect?
('70', 111, 8, 17, 219233) This time there is no question of remaining in the Cabinet.
('70', 111, 8, 18, 219293) We shall see about that at the proper time.
('70', 111, 8, 19, 219337) I didn’t wish to send any draft, but who am I to say no to Mathuradas?
('70', 111, 8, 20, 219408) After all he is my nephew and has been able to coax me into agreeing with a number of things .
('70', 111, 8, 21, 219503) If you don’t approve of the draft write out another, and if you think it your duty to contest the election do so.
('70', 111, 8, 22, 219617) If you think it necessary to make any changes, by all means do so.
('70', 111, 8, 23, 219684) Whatever you do, do with confidence for we have to cross many more deserts yet.
('70', 111, 8, 24, 219764) Improve your health.
('70', 111, 8, 25, 219785) If you can, come to Wardha on your way back from the Frontier Province.

('70', 112, 1, 2, 219983) 129. DISCUSSION WITH BASIL MATHEWS AND OTHERS 1
('70', 112, 2, 3, 220031) [November 24, 1936] 2
('70', 112, 3, 4, 220053) I cannot speak with either the definiteness or the confidence of a Stalin or a Hitler, as I have no cut and dried programme which I can impose on the villagers.
('70', 112, 3, 5, 220214) My method, I need not say, is different.
('70', 112, 3, 6, 220255) I propose to convert by patient persuasion.
('70', 112, 3, 7, 220299) This is a kind of practical adult education to be put to use as it progresses.
('70', 112, 3, 8, 220378) The centre is automatically shifted from the cities to the villages.
('70', 112, 3, 9, 220447) They will be taught to know what they should want and how to obtain it in the shape of sanitation and hygiene, improvement of material conditions and social relations.
('70', 112, 3, 10, 220615) If this primary education is taken by them in its fullness everything else follows.
('70', 112, 3, 11, 220699) But in indicating the ideal I have told you of the difficulties of this stupendous task.
('70', 112, 3, 12, 220788) For you should know that we have smaller, more illiterate villages even than Segaon, where people hug their ignorance and dirt as they do their untouchability.
('70', 112, 4, 13, 220948) With this he gave Mr. Mathews a vivid idea of the village and its inhabitants and surroundings, and spoke on the problem of utilization of waste hours and waste products or of products that were going to waste.
('70', 112, 4, 14, 221159) He described how a successful experiment was now being made of tapping palm trees for gur which were either being used for toddy or not used at all.
('70', 112, 4, 15, 221308) And he gave Mr. Mathews and Mr. Hodge and others present a sample of the gur made that morning.
('70', 112, 4, 16, 221404) A palm tapper had to be engaged, he dictated his own terms.
('70', 112, 4, 17, 221464) Gandhiji said: I want them to dictate their own terms.
('70', 112, 4, 18, 221519) He charges Rs. 10 a month for tapping 25 trees, but when more people begin doing the thing and have learnt how to utilize their idle hours, the adjustment will take place of itself.
('70', 112, 5, 19, 221701) He next talked of sanitation .
('70', 112, 5, 20, 221732) He said: Lionel Curtis 3 when he wrote that the Indian village consisted of dilapidated structures built on dung heaps did not overdraw the picture.
('70', 112, 5, 21, 221881) We have to remove the dung heaps, turn them to good account and make the village site a smiling garden.
('70', 112, 6, 22, 221985) Mr. Basil Mathews .
('70', 112, 6, 23, 222005) .discussed the place of the money lender and the zamindar in the village economy.
('70', 112, 6, 24, 222087) Gandhiji said:
('70', 112, 7, 25, 222102) 1 Extracted from Mahadev Desai’s “Weekly letter” 2 The date is from the manuscript of Mahadev Desai’s Diary.
('70', 112, 7, 26, 222211) 3 Vide “Interview to “The Star”, 6 1 1908
('70', 113, 0, 1, 222253) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 114
('70', 113, 1, 2, 222295) The money lender who is inevitable today will gradually eliminate himself.
('70', 113, 1, 3, 222370) Nor are co operative banks needed, because when I have taught Harijans the arts I want to teach them they will not need much ready money.
('70', 113, 1, 4, 222508) Besides, those who are today deep down in mire cannot make use of co operative banks.
('70', 113, 1, 5, 222594) I am not so much concerned in getting them loans of money or plots of land as I am about getting them bread and butter and even a little cheese.
('70', 113, 1, 6, 222739) When people have learnt the art of turning idle hours to wealth all the adjustment we need will follow.
('70', 113, 2, 7, 222843) But what about the zamindar?
('70', 113, 2, 8, 222872) Would you eliminate him?
('70', 113, 2, 9, 222897) would you destroy him?
('70', 113, 2, 10, 222920) I do not want to destroy the zamindar, but neither do I feel that the zamindar is inevitable.
('70', 113, 2, 11, 223014) I will illustrate how I work out my trusteeship theory here.
('70', 113, 2, 12, 223075) In this village Jamnalalji has a 75 per cent share.
('70', 113, 2, 13, 223127) Of course I have come here not by design but by accident.
('70', 113, 2, 14, 223185) When I approached Jamnalalji for help he built me the required hut and outhouses and said, “Whatever profit there is from Segaon you may take for the welfare of the village.” If I can persuade other zamindars to do likewise village improvement becomes easy.
('70', 113, 2, 15, 223443) Of course the next question is that of the land system and that of Government exploitation.
('70', 113, 2, 16, 223535) I regard the difficulties surrounding that aspect of the question as for the moment necessary evils.
('70', 113, 2, 17, 223636) If the present programme is carried through, I shall perhaps know how to deal with the Government exploitation.
('70', 113, 2, 18, 223748) Your actual economic policy would differ from Mr. Nehru’s?
('70', 113, 2, 19, 223807) He, so far as I understand him, would wipe out the zamindar.
('70', 113, 2, 20, 223868) Yes, we seem to differ in our ideas of village uplift and reconstruction.
('70', 113, 2, 21, 223942) The difference is of emphasis.
('70', 113, 2, 22, 223973) He does not mind the village uplift movement.
('70', 113, 2, 23, 224019) He believes in industrialization; I have grave doubts about its usefulness for India.
('70', 113, 2, 24, 224105) He believes in the ultimate inevitability of class conflict, though he would avoid it if he could.
('70', 113, 2, 25, 224204) I expect to convert the zamindars and other capitalists by the non violent method, and therefore there is for me nothing like an inevitability of class conflict.
('70', 113, 2, 26, 224366) For it is an essential part of non violence to go along the line of least resistance.
('70', 113, 2, 27, 224452) The moment the cultivators of the soil realize their power, the zamindari evil will be sterilized.
('70', 113, 2, 28, 224551) What can the poor zamindar do when they say that they will simply not work the land unless they are paid enough to feed and clothe and educate themselves and their children in a decent manner?
('70', 113, 2, 29, 224744) In reality the toiler is the owner of what he produces.
('70', 113, 2, 30, 224800) If the toilers intelligently
('70', 114, 0, 1, 224829) VOL. 70: 21 OCT0BER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 115
('70', 114, 1, 2, 224877) combine, they will become an irresistible power.
('70', 114, 1, 3, 224926) That is how I do not see the necessity of class conflict.
('70', 114, 1, 4, 224984) If I thought it inevitable I should not hesitate to preach it and teach it.
('70', 114, 2, 5, 225060) Mr. Mathews referred to the Archishop of Canterbury’s speech at the Central Hall, Westminster.
('70', 114, 2, 6, 225155) Gandhiji said: That is a question to which I have given great thought and I am convinced that if Christian missions will sincerely play the game, no matter what may be their policy under normal circumstances, they must withdraw from the indecent competition to convert the Harijans.
('70', 114, 2, 7, 225438) Whatever the Archbishop of Canterbury and others may say, what is done here in India in the name of Christianity is wholly different from what they say.There are others in the field also, but as a devotee of truth I say that if there is any difference between their methods, it is one of degree and not of kind.
('70', 114, 2, 8, 225750) I know of representatives of different religions standing on the same platform and vying with one another to catch the Harijan ear.
('70', 114, 2, 9, 225882) To dignify this movement with the name of spiritual hunger is a travesty of truth.
('70', 114, 2, 10, 225965) Arguing on the highest plane I said to Dr. Mott, if they wanted to convert Harijans had they not better begin to convert me?
('70', 114, 2, 11, 226090) I am a trifle more intelligent than they, and therefore more receptive to the influences of reason that could be brought to bear upon me.
('70', 114, 2, 12, 226228) But to approach the Pulayas and Pariahs with their palsied hands and paralysed intelligence is no Christianity.
('70', 114, 2, 13, 226340) No, whilst our reform movement is going on, all religious minded people should say: Rather than obstruct their work let us support them in their work.
('70', 114, 3, 14, 226491) M. Do not the roots of the reform movement go back to the missionary movement?
('70', 114, 3, 15, 226570) Did not the missionaries wake up the reformers and make a certain amount of stir among the untouchables?
('70', 114, 4, 16, 226675) G. I do not think that the missionary movement was responsible for a stirring of the right kind.
('70', 114, 4, 17, 226772) I agree that it stung the reformers to the quick and awakened them to their sense of duty.
('70', 114, 4, 18, 226863) They say: ‘Here is some good work being done by these missionaries; they open schools and hospitals, train nurses.
('70', 114, 4, 19, 226978) Why don’t we do these things for our own people?’ And they try to do something in indifferent imitation.
('70', 114, 5, 20, 227083) M. You have spoken of some good work being done by missionaries.
('70', 114, 5, 21, 227148) Should not we go on with it?
('70', 114, 6, 22, 227177) G. Oh yes.
('70', 114, 6, 23, 227188) Do, by all means.
('70', 114, 6, 24, 227206) But give up what makes you objects of suspicion and demoralizes us also.
('70', 114, 6, 25, 227279) We go to your hospitals
('70', 115, 0, 1, 227303) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 116
('70', 115, 1, 2, 227345) with the mercenary motive of having an operation performed, but with no object of responding to what is at the back of your mind, even as our children do when they go to Bible classes in their colleges and then laugh at what they read there.
('70', 115, 1, 3, 227587) I tell you our conversation at home about these missionary colleges is not at all edifying.
('70', 115, 1, 4, 227679) Why then spoil your good work with other motives?
('70', 115, 2, 5, 227729) Mr. Mathews was curious to know if Gandhiji followed any spiritual practices and what special reading he had found helpful.
('70', 115, 3, 6, 227853) G. I am a stranger to yogic practices.
('70', 115, 3, 7, 227892) The practice I follow is a practice I learnt in my childhood from my nurse.
('70', 115, 3, 8, 227968) I was afraid of ghosts.
('70', 115, 3, 9, 227992) She used to say to me: ‘There are no ghosts, but if you are afraid, repeat Ramanama.’ What I learnt in my childhood has become a huge thing in my mental firmament.
('70', 115, 3, 10, 228156) It is a sun that has brightened my darkest hour.
('70', 115, 3, 11, 228205) A Christian may find the same solace from the repetition of the name of Jesus and a Muslim from the name of Allah.
('70', 115, 3, 12, 228320) All these things have the same implications and they produce identical results under identical circumstances.
('70', 115, 3, 13, 228430) Only the repetition must not be a lip expression, but part of your very being.
('70', 115, 3, 14, 228509) About helpful readings we have regular readings of the Bhagavad Gita and we have now reached a stage when we finish the Gita every week by having readings of appointed chapters every morning.
('70', 115, 3, 15, 228701) Then we have hymns from the various saints of India, and we therein include hymns from the Christian hymn book.
('70', 115, 3, 16, 228813) As Khan Saheb is with us, we have readings from the Koran also.
('70', 115, 3, 17, 228877) We believe in the equality of all religions.
('70', 115, 3, 18, 228922) I derive the greatest consolation from my reading of Tulsidas’s Ramayana.
('70', 115, 3, 19, 228996) I have also derived solace from the New Testament and the Koran.
('70', 115, 3, 20, 229061) I don’t approach them with a critical mind.
('70', 115, 3, 21, 229105) They are to me as important as the Bhagavad Gita, though everything in the former may not appeal to me—everything in the Epistles of Paul for instance, nor everything in Tulsidas.
('70', 115, 3, 22, 229285) The Gita is a pure religious discourse given without any embellishment.
('70', 115, 3, 23, 229357) It simply describes the progress of the pilgrim soul towards the Supreme Goal.
('70', 115, 3, 24, 229436) Therefore there is no question of selection.
('70', 115, 4, 25, 229481) M. You are really a Protestant.
('70', 115, 5, 26, 229513) G. I do not know what I am or not; Mr. Hodge will call me a Presbyterian!
('70', 115, 6, 27, 229587) M. Where do you find the seat of authority?
('70', 115, 6, 28, 229631) Pointing to his breast, Gandhiji said:
('70', 116, 0, 1, 229670) VOL. 70: 21 OCT0BER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 117
('70', 116, 1, 2, 229718) It lies here.
('70', 116, 1, 3, 229732) I exercise my judgment about every scripture, including the Gita.
('70', 116, 1, 4, 229798) I cannot let a scriptural text supersede my reason.
('70', 116, 1, 5, 229850) Whilst I believe that the principal books are inspired, they suffer from a process of double distillation.
('70', 116, 1, 6, 229957) Firstly, they come through a human prophet, and then through the commentaries of interpreters.
('70', 116, 1, 7, 230052) Nothing in them comes from God directly.
('70', 116, 1, 8, 230093) Mathew may give one version of one text and John may give another.
('70', 116, 1, 9, 230160) I cannot surrender my reason whilst I subscribe to Diving revelation.
('70', 116, 1, 10, 230230) And above all, ‘the letter killeth, the spirit giveth life.’ But you must not misunderstand my position.
('70', 116, 1, 11, 230335) I believe in Faith also, in things where Reason has no place e.g., the existence of God.
('70', 116, 1, 12, 230424) No argument can move me from that faith, and like that little girl who repeated against all reason ‘yet we are seven’ I would like to repeat, on being baffled in argument by a very superior intellect, ‘Yet there is God.’

('70', 116, 4, 15, 230690) WARDHA, November 25, 1936
('70', 116, 5, 16, 230716) DEAR MR. HOGG,
('70', 116, 6, 17, 230731) Thank you for your letter of the 21st instant.
('70', 116, 6, 18, 230778) I am sorry we have not made much headway with papermaking.
('70', 116, 6, 19, 230837) An expert whose services we had secured left us three or four months ago and we are unfortunately now where we were.
('70', 116, 6, 20, 230954) Our students are manufacturing paper of a sort, but it is not up to much.
('70', 116, 6, 21, 231028) I could send you samples of various varieties of hand made paper that we use, but I could not tell you how they are made and the materials from which they are made.
('70', 116, 6, 22, 231193) We here use waste paper clippings from the local press.
('70', 116, 6, 23, 231249) We have now here with us a chemist who can make paper out of gunnybag waste, cotton seed waste, white rags and such other raw materials available in villages.
('70', 116, 6, 24, 231408) But he is still a novice and I am afraid I have nothing to communicate to you which you can profitably pass on to your friend in Egypt.
('70', 116, 6, 25, 231544) For experts in this direction, we have to look to China.
('70', 116, 6, 26, 231601) The paper on which this is being typed is from a village in the neighbourhood of Poona.
('70', 116, 6, 27, 231689) It is the best that I have.
('70', 116, 6, 28, 231717) Our own paper which used to be good when we had our expert here is no good at the present moment.
('70', 116, 6, 29, 231815) I enclose herewith one sheet of Nepal paper made out of bamboo pulp and another of Junnar paper made
('70', 117, 0, 1, 231916) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 118
('70', 117, 1, 2, 231958) out of, I think, tailors’ waste which is identical with the one on which this is being typed.
('70', 117, 1, 3, 232052) The Nizam’s State produces very good hand made paper.
('70', 117, 1, 4, 232106) Perhaps if you write to the Director of Industries, Hyderabad (Dn.), he would send you a descriptive report on paper making as cottage industry.
('70', 117, 1, 5, 232251) I am sorry about the Harijan.
('70', 117, 1, 6, 232281) I am asking the Manager to see that you get your copy regularly.
('70', 117, 1, 7, 232346) Yours sincerely, ENCL.

('70', 117, 5, 16, 232620) I had your previous letter but I had no time.
('70', 117, 5, 17, 232666) I do hope your mother and your pet have come.
('70', 117, 5, 18, 232712) I do hope you won’t have to shift from your present quarters.
('70', 117, 5, 19, 232774) Your earnings are good.
('70', 117, 5, 20, 232798) You must not starve yourself.
('70', 117, 5, 21, 232828) Take plenty of milk, fruit and greens.

('70', 118, 1, 3, 233371) Our village work whets the appetite for knowledge required for the service.
('70', 118, 1, 4, 233447) Mirabai is a lover of cattle as also farming.
('70', 118, 1, 5, 233493) She has a natural aptitude for such work.
('70', 118, 1, 6, 233535) She is anxious to come as quickly as she can if you can take her.
('70', 118, 1, 7, 233601) Of course she will pay the necessary charges.
('70', 118, 1, 8, 233647) The question of housing her may be a difficulty.
('70', 118, 1, 9, 233696) If she has a room in a professor’s house, she will be satisfied.

('70', 118, 4, 12, 233871) MY DEAR ANAND, Your two letters stay for me.
('70', 118, 4, 13, 233916) How could you be so cruel to Vidya or she to you and herself and to her progeny?
('70', 118, 4, 14, 233997) Must love find such unlovely expression!
('70', 118, 4, 15, 234038) Or are the protagonists of contraceptives justified in their furious advocacy of them?
('70', 118, 4, 16, 234125) Can love not deny itself?
('70', 118, 4, 17, 234151) Has it no such power?
('70', 118, 4, 18, 234173) Or is there absence of love where there is absence of self restraint?
('70', 118, 4, 19, 234243) [sic] Or is love powerless before the demands of animal passion?
('70', 118, 4, 20, 234308) You and Vidya are embodiments of emotion.
('70', 118, 4, 21, 234350) Should emotion take such undesirable turns?
('70', 118, 4, 22, 234394) What is done cannot be undone.
('70', 118, 4, 23, 234425) You have now to nurse the child to maturity and nurse Vidya to such health as may be still her lot.
('70', 118, 4, 24, 234525) That is the least you would do.
('70', 118, 4, 25, 234557) But I ask you to consider calmly the questions I have framed.
('70', 118, 4, 26, 234619) If Vidya had no appetite but she could not resist your approach, I would far rather tolerate bigamy than a stormy satisfaction of the animal in you through a helpless mate.
('70', 118, 4, 27, 234792) I am powerless to say more or to say anything less.
('70', 118, 4, 28, 234844) You will share this with Jeramdas.
('70', 118, 4, 29, 234879) I am not writing to him separately.
('70', 118, 4, 30, 234915) Love to you both.

('70', 120, 3, 5, 236489) I have always held myself responsible for Harilal’s being what he is.
('70', 120, 3, 6, 236559) I no doubt have a share in his sins.
('70', 120, 3, 7, 236596) I am undergoing punishment for that and will have to do so in the future also.
('70', 120, 3, 8, 236675) I will not consider that a punishment at all which is inflicted by others.
('70', 120, 3, 9, 236750) I am being punished by my own conscience.
('70', 120, 3, 10, 236792) I do not see anything confidential in your letter though I will not take up the pages of Harijan to reply to it.

('70', 120, 8, 17, 237212) I await your further letter as also information about the images.
('70', 120, 8, 18, 237278) You were good enough to tell me that I was free to make use of your workshops etc., to make researches and get such assistance as was easily available.
('70', 120, 8, 19, 237430) I know Mr. M. Frydman 1 of your electrical depart ment.
('70', 120, 8, 20, 237486) He is a lover of villages and has the village mind.
('70', 120, 8, 21, 237538) Though he has been helping me with his ideas for some years and has recently made me some village tools, I would like you, if it is proper, to instruct him and the Director of Industries to give me or the Village Industries Association such assistance as they can appropriately render.
('70', 120, 8, 22, 237824) Being in a village myself I do need such assistance fairly often.

('70', 122, 4, 9, 239587) There will be no difficulty if she learns things and adopts clean habits.

('70', 122, 7, 12, 239725) 142. A SPUR TO FURTHER PURIFICATION
('70', 122, 8, 13, 239761) If the Travancore proclamation of the religious freedom of Harijans is a matter for great rejoicing, it is also an event calling us to greater humiliation, greater effort and greater purification.
('70', 122, 8, 14, 239958) It is not the end of untouchability.
('70', 122, 8, 15, 239995) It is certainly, as C. Rajagopalachari says, ‘an indication of the potentiality that exists in us, if only we seek His aid’.
('70', 122, 8, 16, 240120) It inspires us with hope and faith in our mission.
('70', 122, 8, 17, 240171) But on no account will it warrant relaxation of effort and vigilance over ourselves.
('70', 122, 8, 18, 240256) If the proclamation is a result of prayer and purification, if the mute prayer of the selfless workers of Travancore aided by kindred spirits all over India, rather than the advertised meetings and their resolutions, inspired H.H. the Maharaja and his advisers to issue the proclamation (it does not matter whether consciously or unconsciously to them), it follows that greater selflessness and devotion of workers must do the rest.
('70', 122, 8, 19, 240689) Let us realize the contents of the rest.
('70', 122, 8, 20, 240730) We do not yet know how the orthodoxy of Travancore and the Harijans will react to the proclamation.
('70', 122, 8, 21, 240830) If it is not followed up by suitable response on the part of the public, it can easily become a dead letter.
('70', 122, 8, 22, 240939) The mere opening of temples will mean nothing, if it does not lead to their purification and that of the priesthood.

('70', 123, 0, 1, 241104) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 124
('70', 123, 1, 2, 241146) The opening of temples in Travancore must lead to their opening in the sister State Cochin and must also lead to the opening of the sister temple of Guruvayyur.
('70', 123, 1, 3, 241307) These are of a piece, guided by the same tradition and ceremonial.
('70', 123, 1, 4, 241374) Then come the great temples of Tamil, Telugu and Canarese India.
('70', 123, 1, 5, 241439) Kashi Vishwanath, Dwarika and Puri temples in the North, West and East still remain closed to the Harijans.
('70', 123, 1, 6, 241547) Of the big black patches of India Travancore, though a big patch in itself, considered relatively, was a small speck.
('70', 123, 1, 7, 241665) It has, by the grace of God showing itself through the proclamation of H. H. the Maharaja, become suddenly a bright spot radiating its light throughout India.
('70', 123, 1, 8, 241824) Will the radiation prove strong enough to affect the big patches I have mentioned?
('70', 123, 1, 9, 241907) And the religious freedom, if it is real in the sense that it comes from the heart of orthodoxy, must be followed by the economic and social betterment of the Harijans all over India.
('70', 123, 1, 10, 242091) A mere mention of these most important things should be sufficient to chasten us.
('70', 123, 1, 11, 242173) But it cannot frighten us if we have a living faith in God and our cause.
('70', 123, 1, 12, 242247) For this great and glorious task we want more workers—men and women, boys and girls.
('70', 123, 1, 13, 242332) We want more money, paper, gold, silver, copper, even handfuls of grain, but these too will surely, as also only, come if the workers whom we already have are, like Caesar’s wife, above suspicion.
('70', 123, 1, 14, 242529) Are we all pure in heart?
('70', 123, 1, 15, 242555) Are we faithful to our trust?
('70', 123, 1, 16, 242585) Have we faith in the purely spiritual nature of our mission?
('70', 123, 1, 17, 242646) If the answers can be in the affirmative, all is well.
('70', 123, 1, 18, 242701) But the cases I have somewhat discussed 1 in these columns and which I am still following up, make me cautious.
('70', 123, 1, 19, 242813) How will it fare if we have other black sheep among us?
('70', 123, 1, 20, 242869) We are none without sin.
('70', 123, 1, 21, 242894) But if we are not men enough publicly and without any attempt to underestimate it, to own up to our guilt, again I ask, how will it fare with us and the cause we have dared to represent?
('70', 123, 1, 22, 243081) My rejoicing over the proclamation is thus tempered by the necessary sadness induced by a vivid knowledge of what is happening in our midst.
('70', 123, 1, 23, 243222) No cause for gloom, equally no warrant for over exultation but the greatest cause for vigilant introspection and a vivid sense of our responsibility rendered greater by the proclamation.

('70', 124, 2, 3, 243536) A correspondent sends me an issue of Indian Swarajya published at Bezwada.
('70', 124, 2, 4, 243611) It contains an article on the place of woman in the Smritis.
('70', 124, 2, 5, 243672) From it I copy the following few extracts without any alteration:
('70', 124, 3, 6, 243738) The wife should ever treat the husband as God, though he be characterless, sensual and devoid of good qualities.
('70', 124, 3, 7, 243851) (Manu 5. 154)
('70', 124, 4, 8, 243865) Women should follow the word of their husbands.
('70', 124, 4, 9, 243913) This is their highest duty.
('70', 124, 4, 10, 243941) (Yajnavalkya 1. 18)
('70', 124, 5, 11, 243961) A woman has no separate sacrifice, ritual or fasting.
('70', 124, 5, 12, 244015) She gains a high place in heaven by serving the husband.
('70', 124, 5, 13, 244072) (Manu 5. 145)
('70', 124, 6, 14, 244086) She who fasts and performs rituals, while the husband lives, cuts off the life of the husband.
('70', 124, 6, 15, 244181) She goes to hell.
('70', 124, 6, 16, 244199) A woman who is after the sacred waters should wash the feet or the whole body of the husband and drink the water; and she attains the highest place (Atri 136 137)
('70', 124, 7, 17, 244362) There is no higher world for the woman than that of the husband.
('70', 124, 7, 18, 244427) She who displeases the husband cannot go to his world after death.
('70', 124, 7, 19, 244494) So she should never displease the husband.
('70', 124, 7, 20, 244537) (Vasistha 21 14)
('70', 124, 8, 21, 244554) That woman who prides in her father’s family and disobeys the husband should be made by the king a prey to the dogs in the presence of a big assembly of people.
('70', 124, 8, 22, 244715) (Manu 8. 371)
('70', 124, 9, 23, 244729) None should eat the food offered by a woman who disobeys the husband.
('70', 124, 9, 24, 244799) Such a woman is to be known as a sensualist.
('70', 124, 9, 25, 244844) (Angiras 69)
('70', 124, 10, 26, 244857) If the wife disobeys the husband when he is given to bad habits or becomes a drunkard or is suffering from physical ailment, then, for three months she should be deprived of her valuable clothes and jewels and kept away.
('70', 124, 10, 27, 245078) (Manu 10. 78) It is sad to think that the Smritis contain texts which can command no respect from men who cherish the liberty of woman as their own and who regard her as the mother of the race; sadder still to think that a newspaper published on behalf of orthodoxy should publish such texts as if they were part of religion.
('70', 124, 10, 28, 245404) Of course there are in the Smritis texts which give woman her due place and regard her with deep veneration.
('70', 124, 10, 29, 245513) The question arises as to what to do with the Smritis that contain texts that are in conflict with other texts in the same Smritis and that are repugnant to the moral sense.
('70', 124, 10, 30, 245687) I have already suggested often enough in these columns that all that is printed in the
('70', 125, 0, 1, 245774) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 126
('70', 125, 1, 2, 245816) name of scriptures need not be taken as the word of God or the inspired word.
('70', 125, 1, 3, 245894) But everyone can’t decide what is good and authentic and what is bad and interpolated.
('70', 125, 1, 4, 245981) There should therefore be some authoritative body that would revise all that passes under the name of scriptures, expurgate all the texts that have no moral value or are contrary to the fundamentals of religion and morality, and present such an edition for the guidance of Hindus.
('70', 125, 1, 5, 246262) The certainty that the whole mass of Hindus and the persons accepted as religious leaders will not accept the validity of such authority need not interfere with the sacred enterprise.
('70', 125, 1, 6, 246446) Work done sincerely and in the spirit of service will have its effect on all in the long run and will most assuredly help those who are badly in need of such assistance.

('70', 125, 3, 8, 246636) 144. THE IDEAL BHANGI 1
('70', 125, 4, 9, 246660) The ideal Bhangi of my conception would be a Brahmin par excellence, possibly even excel him.
('70', 125, 4, 10, 246754) It is possible to envisage the existence of a Bhangi without a Brahmin.
('70', 125, 4, 11, 246826) But without the former the latter could not be.
('70', 125, 4, 12, 246874) It is the Bhangi who enables society to live.
('70', 125, 4, 13, 246920) A Bhangi does for society what a mother does for her baby.
('70', 125, 4, 14, 246979) A mother washes her baby of the dirt and insures his health.
('70', 125, 4, 15, 247040) Even so the Bhangi protects and safeguards the health of the entire community by maintaining sanitation for it.
('70', 125, 4, 16, 247152) The Brahmin’s duty is to look after the sanitation of the soul, the Bhangi’s that of the body of society.
('70', 125, 4, 17, 247258) But there is a difference in practice; the Brahmin generally does not live up to his duty, the Bhangi does, willy nilly no doubt.
('70', 125, 4, 18, 247388) Society is sustained by several services.
('70', 125, 4, 19, 247430) The Bhangi constitutes the foundation of all services.
('70', 125, 4, 20, 247485) And yet our woebegone Indian society has branded the Bhangi as a social pariah, set him down at the bottom of the scale, held him fit only to receive kicks and abuse, a creature who must subsist on the leavings of the caste people and dwell on the dung heap.
('70', 125, 4, 21, 247744) He is without a friend, his very name has become a term of reproach.
('70', 125, 4, 22, 247813) This is shocking.
('70', 125, 4, 23, 247831) It is perhaps useless to seek the why and wherefore of it.
('70', 125, 4, 24, 247890) I certainly am unaware of the origin of the inhuman conduct, but I know this much that by looking down upon the Bhangi we—Hindus,

('70', 126, 1, 2, 248160) Mussalmans, Christians and all—have deserved the contempt of the whole world.
('70', 126, 1, 3, 248238) Our villages have today become seats of dirt and insanitation and the villagers come to an early and untimely death.
('70', 126, 1, 4, 248355) If only we had given due recognition to the status of the Bhangi as equal to that of a Brahmin as in fact and justice he deserves, our villages today no less than their inhabitants would have looked a picture of cleanliness and order.
('70', 126, 1, 5, 248590) We would have to a large extent been free from the ravages of a host of diseases which directly spring from our uncleanliness and lack of sanitary habits.
('70', 126, 1, 6, 248745) I therefore make bold to state without any manner of hesitation or doubt that not till the invidious distinction between the Brahmin and the Bhangi is removed will our society enjoy health, prosperity and peace, and be happy.
('70', 126, 1, 7, 248971) What qualities should such an honoured servant of society exemplify in his person?
('70', 126, 1, 8, 249054) In my opinion an ideal Bhangi should have a thorough knowledge of the principles of sanitation.
('70', 126, 1, 9, 249150) He should know how a right kind of latrine is constructed and the correct way of cleaning it.
('70', 126, 1, 10, 249244) He should know how to overcome and destroy the odour of excreta and the various disinfectants to render them innocuous.
('70', 126, 1, 11, 249364) He should likewise know the process of converting night soil and urine into manure.
('70', 126, 1, 12, 249448) But that is not all.
('70', 126, 1, 13, 249469) My ideal Bhangi would know the quality of night soil and urine.
('70', 126, 1, 14, 249533) He would keep a close watch on these and give a timely warning to the individual concerned.
('70', 126, 1, 15, 249625) Thus he will give a timely notice of the results of his examination of the excreta.
('70', 126, 1, 16, 249709) That presupposes a scientific knowledge of the requirements of his profession.
('70', 126, 1, 17, 249788) He would likewise be an authority on the subject of disposal of night soil in small villages as well as big cities and his advice and guidance in the matter would be sought for and freely given to society.
('70', 126, 1, 18, 249994) It goes without saying that he would have the usual learning necessary for reaching the standard here laid down for his profession.
('70', 126, 1, 19, 250126) Such an ideal Bhangi, while deriving his livelihood from his occupation, would approach it only as a sacred duty.
('70', 126, 1, 20, 250240) In other words, he would not dream of amassing wealth out of it.
('70', 126, 1, 21, 250305) He would consider himself responsible for the proper removal and disposal of all the dirt and night soil within the area which he serves and regard the maintenance of healthy and sanitary condition within the same as the summum bonum of his existence.
('70', 127, 0, 1, 250557) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 128
('70', 127, 1, 2, 250599) How may we have this ideal Bhangi?
('70', 127, 1, 3, 250634) Only when we have produced an army of Appa Patwardhans 1. To clothe the Bhangi with the dignity and respect due to him is the especial task and privilege of the educated class.
('70', 127, 1, 4, 250811) Some members of the class would first themselves master the science of sanitation to educate the Bhangi round them in the same.
('70', 127, 1, 5, 250939) They would carefully study their present condition and the causes underlying it and set themselves to the task of eradicating the same by dint of inexhaustible perserverance and patience that never looks back and knows no defeat.
('70', 127, 1, 6, 251169) They would teach them the laws of cleanliness.
('70', 127, 1, 7, 251216) Our Bhangis do not today possess even good brooms or other suitable means for the removal of night soil.
('70', 127, 1, 8, 251321) The latrines themselves are wretched.
('70', 127, 1, 9, 251359) The site round the Bhangis’ quarters is no better than a cesspool of dirt.
('70', 127, 1, 10, 251434) All this can only go if some of the educated class give themselves up to the task of redeeming the Bhangi from his present plight and thus redeeming society from its terrible insanitation.
('70', 127, 1, 11, 251623) Surely this is work enough to satisfy the highest ambition of one who has the spirit of service in him.

('70', 127, 6, 18, 251944) You must get rid of this tiredness.

('70', 128, 4, 8, 252624) Where is the need for my coming there early?
('70', 128, 4, 9, 252669) I promised Dev and Dastane that I should be there towards the first week of December, but the stipulation was that you felt the need of my presence there.
('70', 128, 4, 10, 252824) My coming causes unnecessary excitement.
('70', 128, 4, 11, 252865) Do you think I should come?
('70', 128, 4, 12, 252893) I do not think so.
('70', 128, 4, 13, 252912) When I come, possibly a few good workers will get tied up on my account.

('70', 128, 10, 26, 253445) How can I conceal my feelings when I must speak out?
('70', 128, 10, 27, 253498) 1 I am so heartily thankful that I have assumed the responsibility for having the order carried out.
('70', 128, 10, 28, 253599) Now read the laws that have been enacted for temple goers and tell me if my caution was justified or not.
('70', 128, 10, 29, 253705) Do we not see everywhere that an order says one thing while the laws framed for its implementation are such as to negate it?

('70', 129, 2, 4, 254369) I did not have the occasion to express my views on the above subject.
('70', 129, 2, 5, 254439) But, as mentioned by the correspondent, I certainly believe that birth control can be made effective only through self control.
('70', 129, 2, 6, 254567) Any other means of birth control is likely to result in harm.
('70', 129, 2, 7, 254629) One can easily discern the evil effects of artificial birth control methods where they have taken root.
('70', 129, 2, 8, 254733) It is not surprising that those who advocate birth control without abstention cannot see these, as it has gained footing in the name of morality.
('70', 129, 2, 9, 254879) It is an exaggeration to say that the object of the committee formed in Ahmedabad is what the correspondent states it to be.
('70', 129, 2, 10, 255004) But whatever its aim may be, its activities will definitely result in an increase in sexual indulgence.
('70', 129, 2, 11, 255108) Water when thrown on the ground is bound to follow a downward course; similarly, if means are invented to facilitate sexual indulgence, it is bound to increase.
('70', 129, 2, 12, 255269) Similarly, it is an exaggeration to believe that doctors and vaidyas do not preach self restraint as it is likely to affect their incomes adversely.
('70', 129, 2, 13, 255418) Doctors and vaidyas have never considered it their field to advocate self restraint.
('70', 129, 2, 14, 255503) But I see clear signs of these men tending more and more to do so.
('70', 129, 2, 15, 255570) Their field is to diagnose diseases and cure them.
('70', 129, 2, 16, 255621) If they do not assign primary importance to indulgence and lack of self restraint as a cause of disease, a time will come when they will have to stop their practice.
('70', 129, 2, 17, 255787) As society becomes increasingly intelligent, it will not rest satisfied unless diseases are completely eradicated.
('70', 129, 2, 18, 255902) And, so long as society does not turn towards self restraint and does not observe the rules to prevent diseases, it is impossible for it to remain healthy.
('70', 129, 2, 19, 256058) This is so clear that ultimately everyone will be able to see it and honest doctors will give it the utmost importance.
('70', 129, 2, 20, 256178) I have no doubt that birth control without self control will contribute largely towards increase in sexual indulgence.
('70', 129, 2, 21, 256297) Hence, it is my humble opinion that the Ahmedabad League can obtain the desired results if it goes deeper into the problem and, taking into account the dangerous consequences of lack of self

('70', 129, 3, 23, 256512) The correspondent had noted with disapproval the setting up of a Birth control League in Ahmedabad which in his view must lead to an increase of licentiousness.

('70', 130, 3, 4, 256871) 149. ONE ENEMY ALONE
('70', 130, 4, 5, 256892) A man has only one enemy and only one friend: and that is himself.
('70', 130, 4, 6, 256959) These are not my words but of all the Shastras.
('70', 130, 4, 7, 257007) A person becomes his own enemy when he deceives himself.
('70', 130, 4, 8, 257064) He becomes his own friend when he puts himself in the hands of the God who is within him.
('70', 130, 4, 9, 257154) The necessity for writing this has arisen from the two instances of fall which I have mentioned and other such instances, major as well as minor, which I come across.
('70', 130, 4, 10, 257321) As I go deeper into these, I find that the persons concerned are practising self deception.The results of my investigations have yet to be known.
('70', 130, 4, 11, 257467) All of us commit sins.
('70', 130, 4, 12, 257490) But we degrade ourselves more when we try to appear innocent though we are really guilty.
('70', 130, 4, 13, 257580) A man degrades himself with two women who regard him as a brother, a saint, a sincere worker, a teacher or guru, and then marries one of them.
('70', 130, 4, 14, 257723) I regard it as a device to hide one’s licentious conduct.
('70', 130, 4, 15, 257781) To call such a relationship marriage is to abuse the sacrament of marriage.
('70', 130, 4, 16, 257857) I know such things are happening at many places these days.
('70', 130, 4, 17, 257917) But any adding to sin or multiplying it will not make it accepted as virtue.
('70', 130, 4, 18, 257994) If the whole world practises sin it may well become a custom, nevertheless it will remain sin.
('70', 130, 4, 19, 258089) I am aware that this does not apply to all acts which are regarded as sins.
('70', 130, 4, 20, 258165) I have in mind things which have been regarded as sinful for generations and which are considered as such by society today.
('70', 130, 4, 21, 258289) Teachers develop secret relationships with their women students.
('70', 130, 4, 22, 258354) That in some cases these relationships are given the form of marriage does not make them virtuous.
('70', 130, 4, 23, 258453) It is my firm opinion that just as husband wife relationship is not possible between brothers and sisters, so should it not be possible in the case of teachers and pupils.
('70', 130, 4, 24, 258625) If this golden rule is not faithfully adhered to, educational institutions will eventually collapse; no girl will be safe from her men teachers.
('70', 130, 4, 25, 258770) A teacher’s position is such that students—both boys and girls—are constantly under his influence; they regard the teacher’s words as gospel truth.
('70', 130, 4, 26, 258918) So they do not entertain any doubts about any liberties taken by the teacher.
('70', 130, 4, 27, 258996) Hence such relationships are regarded, and
('70', 131, 0, 1, 259039) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 132
('70', 131, 1, 2, 259081) should be regarded, as uncondonable where the soul is respected as something apart from the body.
('70', 131, 1, 3, 259179) When such relationship creeps into an institution such as the Harijan Sevak Sangh, it has far reaching evil effects and ruins its activities.
('70', 131, 1, 4, 259321) I am thoroughly convinced that behind the unexpected event of the temples of Travancore being thrown open to Harijans lies the strength of the service of silent workers.
('70', 131, 1, 5, 259491) Such workers are scattered all over the country.
('70', 131, 1, 6, 259540) They do not want fame, they have no false sense of pride.
('70', 131, 1, 7, 259598) They find their fulfilment in service alone.
('70', 131, 1, 8, 259643) As a result of their punya God came to dwell in the heart of the Maharaja of Travancore and made him throw open the temples to Harijans.
('70', 131, 1, 9, 259780) This step is the first glimpse of the glory of God.
('70', 131, 1, 10, 259832) It is an invitation to the workers to become more alert, purer and more dedicated.
('70', 131, 1, 11, 259915) No workers, whether men or women, can rest in peace as long as all the temples are not thrown open to Harijans, hypocrisy, wickedness and filth are not banished from all the temples and untouchability is not eradicated from the very marrow of Hinduism.
('70', 131, 1, 12, 260168) And, they should realize that the delay caused in washing away the sin which has existed since time immemorial is due to the sins of the workers which have come to light recently.
('70', 131, 1, 13, 260348) Who knows, there may be other such workers concealing their sins.
('70', 131, 1, 14, 260414) The workers should not cling to their weaknesses by looking upon their sins as virtues, they should not fall and drag their work with them by hiding their sins, nor should they satisfy themselves with admitting their sins only partially.
('70', 131, 1, 15, 260652) Some persons are hesitant to acknowledge publicly their own sins, some others put a gloss over them while acknowledging them.
('70', 131, 1, 16, 260778) Religion proclaims: Magnify your sins into mountains even when they are as small as mustard seeds.
('70', 131, 1, 17, 260877) If you sincerely confess your guilt you will look as clean as a cloth after its dirt has been washed off.
('70', 131, 1, 18, 260983) And your public confession and repentence will be like a shield to guard you in future.

('70', 132, 1, 2, 261326) handed over to Sardar Vallabhbhai for use in Kathiawar.
('70', 132, 1, 3, 261382) I was to decide how that money should be disbursed.
('70', 132, 1, 4, 261434) Those who collected the fund had thought that this sum could be utilized for khadi and Harijan work.
('70', 132, 1, 5, 261535) I have been given to understand that at the moment money is not needed for khadi work.
('70', 132, 1, 6, 261622) The Spinners’ Association is doing its utmost to meet the needs of khadi work in Kathiawar.
('70', 132, 1, 7, 261714) Moreover, I understand that there is a provision in the late Mohanlal Pandya Memorial Fund for developing khadi activities in Kathiawar.
('70', 132, 1, 8, 261851) I know, however, that funds are badly needed for Harijan work in Kathiawar.
('70', 132, 1, 9, 261927) Hence, I have decided to hand over the above mentioned purse for the welfare of the Harijans to Shri Nanalal Kalidas Jhaveri, the Sangh’s representative from Kathiawar.
('70', 132, 1, 10, 262096) Let me correct an error along with this.
('70', 132, 1, 11, 262137) Shri Narandas writes to say that he had contributed 200,000 yards and not an equal number of rounds 1. A round measures four feet whereas a yard is only three feet.
('70', 132, 1, 12, 262302) And spinning had been carried on in the school for three months, not two.

('70', 135, 7, 24, 267389) (4) The Harijan members of the Congress party will have full freedom of opinion and vote in respect of matters specially affecting the Harijan community, where they differ from the policy adopted by the party, should any such difference arise.

('70', 136, 1, 8, 268274) I still have my fear.
('70', 136, 1, 9, 268296) It seems that so far you have been able to keep your head above water.
('70', 136, 1, 10, 268367) If you succeed in doing that till the end, it will be a triumph for you and I shall be immensely satisfied.
('70', 136, 1, 11, 268475) Take it that for me it will have no value if you drain your energies and come first in all the subjects.
('70', 136, 1, 12, 268580) It has been truly said that the body is verily the first means necessary for the performance of dharma.
('70', 136, 2, 13, 268684) Eat wherever you want.
('70', 136, 2, 14, 268707) Stay where you wish.
('70', 136, 2, 15, 268728) But remain healthy.
('70', 136, 2, 16, 268748) I have not given permission to Amtul Salaam to go anywhere.
('70', 136, 2, 17, 268808) However, I have not debarred her from going to Trivandrum although I have issued several other injunctions.
('70', 136, 2, 18, 268916) It was of course good that you did not see her.
('70', 136, 2, 19, 268964) There is no doubt that she is childish and foolish.
('70', 136, 2, 20, 269016) She would squander one lakh of rupees if she had that amount.
('70', 136, 2, 21, 269078) Do not encourage her but at the same time do not neglect her.
('70', 136, 2, 22, 269140) She has been asking me to withdraw the injunction against her seeing you but I did not pay any heed to her.
('70', 136, 2, 23, 269248) Your examination result is very good.
('70', 136, 2, 24, 269286) I had no doubt about it.
('70', 136, 2, 25, 269311) You have given a good account of Harilal.
('70', 136, 2, 26, 269353) God alone can guide him.
('70', 136, 2, 27, 269378) That is why I do not say anything to him.
('70', 136, 2, 28, 269420) I had a letter from him recently.
('70', 136, 2, 29, 269454) There was nothing in it.
('70', 136, 2, 30, 269479) I have replied to it, an Arya Samajist is carrying on correspondence with me.
('70', 136, 2, 31, 269557) He may improve if the Arya Samajists guide him properly, although the correspondent writes that that probability is remote.
('70', 136, 2, 32, 269681) I have forgotten his name but I have noted it down somewhere.
('70', 136, 2, 33, 269743) Harilal still wants to marry.
('70', 136, 2, 34, 269773) He wants money and a life of ease and enjoyment.
('70', 136, 2, 35, 269822) You probably know about his talk with Surendraji.
('70', 136, 2, 36, 269872) However, it is impossible to set store by his word because he is not consistent.

('70', 137, 5, 12, 270420) December 1, 1936
('70', 137, 6, 13, 270437) TARI, 1
('70', 137, 7, 14, 270445) I have your letter.
('70', 137, 7, 15, 270465) Do I have to return any of the books you have sent?
('70', 137, 7, 16, 270517) I shall write to you even if you don’t.
('70', 137, 7, 17, 270557) I cannot bear to see you despair.
('70', 137, 7, 18, 270591) You ought to make an effort.
('70', 137, 7, 19, 270620) How old are you that you should lose hope?
('70', 137, 7, 20, 270663) Come to me if you would not get yourself treated there.
('70', 137, 7, 21, 270719) For my part I like Dr. Oommen’s suggestion.
('70', 137, 7, 22, 270763) You will have a change of place and also the help of that kind gentleman.
('70', 137, 7, 23, 270837) And also by the time you return you would have learnt something.
('70', 137, 7, 24, 270902) Be guided by me.
('70', 137, 7, 25, 270919) I understand about the Mahila Ashram.
('70', 137, 7, 26, 270957) I think you wrote a little about it earlier.
('70', 137, 7, 27, 271002) You should never give up writing to me.
('70', 137, 7, 28, 271042) How can we lower the value of our word?
('70', 137, 7, 29, 271082) By insisting on writing to me, maybe you will become steady and will not accept defeat.

('70', 137, 10, 33, 271349) [December 1, 1936] 3
('70', 137, 11, 34, 271370) QUESTION: Do you see a reason for Christian workers in the West to come here, and if so what is their contribution?
('70', 137, 12, 35, 271486) 1 Sister of Sushila Gandhi, Gandhiji’s daughter in law.
('70', 137, 12, 36, 271542) 2 Extracted from Mahadev Desai’s “Weekly Letter”.
('70', 137, 12, 37, 271592) The questions were asked by visitors interested in Christian mass movements.
('70', 137, 12, 38, 271669) 3 From the manuscript of Mahadev Desai’s Diary
('70', 138, 0, 1, 271716) VOL. 70: 21 OCT0BER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 139
('70', 138, 1, 2, 271764) ANSWER: In the manner in which they are working, there would seem to be no room for them.
('70', 138, 1, 3, 271854) Quite unconsciously they do harm to themselves and so to us.
('70', 138, 1, 4, 271915) It is perhaps impertinent for me to say that they do harm to themselves, but quite pertinent to say that they do harm to us.
('70', 138, 1, 5, 272040) They do harm to those amongst whom they work and those amongst whom they do not work, i.e., the harm is done to the whole of India.
('70', 138, 1, 6, 272172) They present a Christianity of their belief but not the message of Jesus as I understand it.
('70', 138, 1, 7, 272265) The more I study their activities the more sorry I become.
('70', 138, 1, 8, 272324) There is such a gross misunderstanding of religion on the part of those who are intelligent, very far advanced and whose motives need not be questioned.
('70', 138, 1, 9, 272477) It is a tragedy that such a thing should happen in the human family.
('70', 138, 2, 10, 272546) Q. You are referring to things as they are at present.
('70', 138, 2, 11, 272601) Do you visualize a situation in which there is a different approach?
('70', 138, 3, 12, 272670) A. Your ability is unquestioned.
('70', 138, 3, 13, 272703) You can utilize all those abilities for the service of India which she would appreciate.
('70', 138, 3, 14, 272792) That can only happen if there are no mental reservations.
('70', 138, 3, 15, 272850) If you come to give education, you must give it after the Indian pattern.
('70', 138, 3, 16, 272924) You should sympathetically study our institutions and suggest changes.
('70', 138, 3, 17, 272995) But you come with preconceived notions and seek to destroy.
('70', 138, 3, 18, 273055) If people from the West came on Indian terms, they would supply a felt want.
('70', 138, 3, 19, 273132) When Americans come and ask me what service they could render, I tell them: ‘If you dengle your millions before us, you will make beggars of us and demoralize us.’ But in one thing I do not mind being a beggar.
('70', 138, 3, 20, 273343) I would beg of you your scientific talent.
('70', 138, 3, 21, 273386) You can ask your engineers and agricultural experts to place their services at our disposal.
('70', 138, 3, 22, 273479) They must not come to us as our lords and masters but as voluntary workers.
('70', 138, 3, 23, 273555) A paid servant would throw up his job any day, but a volunteer worker could not do so.
('70', 138, 3, 24, 273642) If such come, the more the merrier.
('70', 138, 3, 25, 273678) A Mysore engineer who is a Pole 1 has sent me a box of hand made tools made to suit village requirements.
('70', 138, 3, 26, 273784) Supposing an engineer of that character comes and studies our tools and our cottage machines and suggests improvements in them, he would be of great service.
('70', 138, 3, 27, 273942) If you do this kind of work in a religious spirit you will have delivered the message of Jesus.
('70', 138, 4, 28, 274038) Q. There is this mood abroad in the world.
('70', 138, 5, 29, 274081) A. I would like to see it amongst missionaries in general in India.
('70', 138, 6, 30, 274149) 1 Maurice Frydman
('70', 139, 0, 1, 274167) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 140
('70', 139, 1, 2, 274209) Q. What would happen if there is an increase in the process of multiplying Christians?
('70', 139, 2, 3, 274296) A. If there is an appreciable increase, there would be blood feuds between Harijans themselves, more savage than the feuds we have in Bombay.
('70', 139, 2, 4, 274438) Fifty per cent of the residents in Segaon are Harijans.
('70', 139, 2, 5, 274494) Supposing you stole away 10 Harijans and built a church for them you would set up father against son, and son against father, and you would find texts in the Bible to support your action.
('70', 139, 2, 6, 274682) That would be a caricature of Christianity.
('70', 139, 3, 7, 274726) Here Gandhiji explained that the whole story of the sudden uprush of spiritual hunger among the millions of untouchables was absurd.
('70', 139, 3, 8, 274859) A speech at Central Hall, Westminster, made by Bishop Pickett, of which he had read a report in the Church Times, had greatly shocked him.
('70', 139, 3, 9, 274998) He said: He has made such extravagant statements that I would want a demonstration of them—even of the statement that millions were seeking to be converted.
('70', 139, 4, 10, 275155) Q. Apart from the contribution through the realm of scientific achievement, evangelism seems to be out of the question in establishing relationships between East and West?
('70', 139, 4, 11, 275327) A. I do say that.
('70', 139, 4, 12, 275345) But I speak with a mental reservation.
('70', 139, 4, 13, 275384) I cannot only reconcile myself to—I must recognize—a fact in nature which it is useless to gainsay—I mean proper evangelization.
('70', 139, 4, 14, 275513) When you feel you have received peace from your particular interpretation of the Bible, you share it with others.
('70', 139, 4, 15, 275627) But you do not need to give vocal expression to it.
('70', 139, 4, 16, 275679) Your whole life is more eloquent than your lips.
('70', 139, 4, 17, 275728) Language is always an obstacle to the full expression of thought.
('70', 139, 4, 18, 275794) How, for instance, will you tell a man to read the Bible as you read it, how by word of mouth will you transfer to him the light as you receive it from day to day and moment to moment?
('70', 139, 4, 19, 275979) Therefore all religions say: ‘Your life is your speech.’ If you are humble enough you will say you cannot adequately represent your religion by speech or pen.
('70', 139, 5, 20, 276138) Q. But may not one in all humility say, ‘I know that my life falls far short of the ideal; let me explain the ideal I stand for’?
('70', 139, 6, 21, 276268) You bid good bye to humility the moment you say that life is not adequate and that you must supplement it by speech.
('70', 139, 6, 22, 276385) Human species need not go to animals and shout to them: ‘We are humans.’ The animals know them as humans.
('70', 139, 6, 23, 276491) The language of the

('70', 140, 1, 2, 276606) soul never lends itself to expression.
('70', 140, 1, 3, 276645) It rises superior to the body.
('70', 140, 1, 4, 276676) Language is a limitation of the truth which can be only represented by life.
('70', 140, 2, 5, 276753) Q. How then is experience to be passed on from generation to generation without some articulate expression?
('70', 140, 3, 6, 276861) A. There is no occasion for articulate expression.
('70', 140, 3, 7, 276912) Life is its own expression.
('70', 140, 3, 8, 276940) I take the simile of the rose I used years ago.
('70', 140, 3, 9, 276988) The rose does not need to write a book or deliver a sermon on the scent it sheds all around, nor on the beauty which every one who has eyes can see.
('70', 140, 3, 10, 277137) Well, spiritual life is infinitely superior to the beautiful and fragrant rose, and I make bold to say that the moment there is a spiritual expression in life, the surroundings will readily respond.
('70', 140, 3, 11, 277336) There are passages in the Bible, the Gita, the Bhagavata, the Koran, which eloquently show this.
('70', 140, 3, 12, 277433) “Wherever”, we read, “Krishna appeared, people acted like those possessed.” The same thing about Jesus.
('70', 140, 3, 13, 277537) But to come nearer home, why are people touched as if by magic wherever Jawaharlal goes?
('70', 140, 3, 14, 277626) They sometimes do not even know he has come, and yet they take sudden fire from the very thought that he is coming.
('70', 140, 3, 15, 277742) Now there it may not be described as a spiritual influence, but there is a subtle influence and it is unquestionably there, call it by what name you like.
('70', 140, 3, 16, 277897) They do not want to hear him,they simply want to see him.
('70', 140, 3, 17, 277955) And that is natural.
('70', 140, 3, 18, 277976) You cannot deal with millions in any other way.
('70', 140, 3, 19, 278024) Spiritual life has greater potency than Marconi waves.
('70', 140, 3, 20, 278079) When there is no medium between me and my Lord and I simply become a willing vessel for his influences to flow into it, then I overflow as the water of the Ganges at its source.
('70', 140, 3, 21, 278257) There is no desire to speak when one lives the truth.
('70', 140, 3, 22, 278311) Truth is most economical of words.
('70', 140, 3, 23, 278346) There is thus no truer or other evangelism than life.
('70', 140, 4, 24, 278400) Q. But if a person were to ask the source of such a life, what then?
('70', 140, 5, 25, 278469) A. Then you will speak, but your language will be well thought out.
('70', 140, 5, 26, 278537) You will yourself feel that.
('70', 140, 5, 27, 278566) It defies expression.
('70', 140, 5, 28, 278588) But then the questioner probes further, if he is a searcher.
('70', 140, 5, 29, 278649) Then you will draw him to you.
('70', 140, 5, 30, 278680) You will not need to go to him.
('70', 140, 5, 31, 278712) Your fame will so spread that people from all parts of the world will flock to see you and listen to you.
('70', 140, 5, 32, 278818) You will then speak to them.
('70', 140, 5, 33, 278847) Take Aurobindo Ghose.
('70', 140, 5, 34, 278869) Many from all parts go to him.
('70', 140, 5, 35, 278900) He does not even see them, except on two days during the year, and never talks to them.
('70', 140, 6, 36, 278988) Q. You see any indication that there is a drawing together of those who have
('70', 140, 7, 37, 279065) intimations of a higher life?
('70', 141, 0, 1, 279095) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 142
('70', 141, 1, 2, 279137) A. Yes.
('70', 141, 1, 3, 279145) But not through these organizations.
('70', 141, 1, 4, 279182) They are a bar to the process.
('70', 141, 1, 5, 279213) Why am I at Segaon?
('70', 141, 1, 6, 279233) Because I believe that my message will have a better chance of penetrating the masses of India, and maybe through them to the world.
('70', 141, 1, 7, 279366) I am otherwise not a man capable of shutting myself up.
('70', 141, 1, 8, 279422) But I am so downright natural that once I feel a call I go forward with it, whatever happens.
('70', 141, 1, 9, 279516) Mr. Hofmeyer 1 of the South African Delegation appreciated my desire not to move out; he did not resent it as price or indifference.
('70', 141, 1, 10, 279649) Economy of words and action has therefore its value.
('70', 141, 1, 11, 279702) Only it has to be natural.

('70', 141, 4, 15, 279818) BAPA, Your letters have kept coming.
('70', 141, 4, 16, 279855) I have had no misgivings so far about the propriety of the steps taken in connection with Travancore.
('70', 141, 4, 17, 279957) Only harm and no good can come if the limit laid down by me is not adhered to.
('70', 141, 4, 18, 280036) I am enclosing the correspondence with Bapi Needu.
('70', 141, 4, 19, 280087) Keep the Valunjkar report in a file there.
('70', 141, 4, 20, 280130) The duplicity of Govind Babu is becoming obvious.
('70', 141, 4, 21, 280180) He himself wrote that he would come and make a clarification.
('70', 141, 4, 22, 280242) I invited him and now he writes: “I do not wish to come to you.
('70', 141, 4, 23, 280306) Your ideas and mine differ.
('70', 141, 4, 24, 280334) I am not satisfied with social activities” and so on.
('70', 141, 4, 25, 280388) On the other hand evidence against him is piling up with me.
('70', 141, 4, 26, 280449) I write this since you have taken interest in this case.

('70', 141, 7, 31, 280650) Parameshwari Prasad has been here for the last two days.
('70', 141, 7, 32, 280707) He had a talk with Jamnalalji and myself.

('70', 142, 1, 3, 280980) Go through it if you can find the time.
('70', 142, 1, 4, 281020) Parameshwari Prasad suggests that all share holders should donate their shares, thereby turning the limited company into a public association.
('70', 142, 1, 5, 281163) With this donation a start would be made and public donations would be asked for the rest of the capital.
('70', 142, 1, 6, 281269) Jamnalalji and I have decided to go by what you decide in the matter.
('70', 142, 1, 7, 281339) Now about the loan you have advanced.
('70', 142, 1, 8, 281377) I have advised that it may be treated as all other loans and that it should be repaid.
('70', 142, 1, 9, 281464) Even if the whole set up should have to be wound up, it would remain a first charge along with Nathuramji’s money.
('70', 142, 1, 10, 281579) And if it turned into a public association it would perforce have to assume the responsibility for all debts.
('70', 142, 1, 11, 281689) Parameshwari Prasad is going to Calcutta.
('70', 142, 1, 12, 281731) He will explain the matter to you.
('70', 142, 1, 13, 281766) Having heard him you will do what you think best.
('70', 142, 1, 14, 281816) This has been taken down by your daughter Anasuya.

('70', 142, 4, 19, 282071) Does death spare anyone?

('70', 143, 8, 15, 283518) [Before December 5, 1936]
('70', 143, 9, 16, 283544) For some time past a party of students of Village Workers Training School has been visiting villages in the neighbourhood on appointed evenings reciting the Tulsi Ramayana and bhajans.
('70', 143, 9, 17, 283729) Now that the boys, examinations are drawing near, a proposal came to drop the visits for the time being.
('70', 143, 9, 18, 283834) Said Gandhiji to them: This has shocked me.
('70', 143, 9, 19, 283878) If your studies cannot stand this brief relaxation, and you must pore over your books all the twenty four hours because of the approach of the examination, those studies are worth nothing.
('70', 143, 9, 20, 284067) But apart from this, your proposal augurs ill for the villagers.
('70', 143, 9, 21, 284132) You have promised to go to them on appointed evenings,
('70', 143, 10, 22, 284187) 1 Gandhiji had nursed Mirabehn and Nanavati when they were ill in October.
('70', 143, 10, 23, 284262) 2 This was a joint statement issued by Gandhiji and Kasturbhai Lalbhai, an industrialist and mill owner of Ahmedabad.
('70', 143, 10, 24, 284380) 3 For Gandhiji’s Award, vide “Award in Labour Dispute”, 26 12 1936. 4 Extracted from Mahadev Desai’s “Weekly Letter”
('70', 144, 0, 1, 284497) VOL. 70: 21 OCT0BER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 145
('70', 144, 1, 2, 284545) and now you are going to break the promise.
('70', 144, 1, 3, 284589) I tell you the few visits you have paid to them will be as inauspicious as the appearance of the comet is supposed to be.
('70', 144, 1, 4, 284711) They may be worse.
('70', 144, 1, 5, 284730) The comet appears suddenly almost without notice, Nature’s known laws do not seem to govern it.
('70', 144, 1, 6, 284826) But you gave them a promise and now if you go back on it, they will feel that it is not for them that you go there but just to please your own fancies.
('70', 144, 1, 7, 284978) That feeling will breed indifference and ultimatley disgust.
('70', 144, 1, 8, 285039) I tell you these visits are more impotrant than the visits to distribute medicines to the villages.
('70', 144, 1, 9, 285139) The medicines are good for their physical ailments, Ramayana is good for their spiritual ailments.
('70', 144, 1, 10, 285238) If you had not made the beginning I should not have asked you to do so.
('70', 144, 1, 11, 285310) They never invited you or expected you to go there, but now that the beginning has been made you should keep it up.
('70', 144, 1, 12, 285426) These visits give you a living touch with the people; rather than drop them you must think out how you can make them more and more useful and successful.
('70', 144, 2, 13, 285580) He next spoke to them in answer to a question about the profession of the Bhangi.
('70', 144, 2, 14, 285662) He asked them to study the article 1 on the Ideal Bhangi that he had written for the current issue of Harijan and to fill in the details if they were wanting.
('70', 144, 2, 15, 285821) He regaled them with stories of the Bhangi who was serving the village, and who was now being asked to go for negligent work, and of the new Bhangi who asked for Rs. 30 a month and ultimately became ready to accept Rs. 15. [He said:] Now it is your work to mend these people’s ways, and you cannot do so unless you are good Bhangis yourselves.
('70', 144, 2, 16, 286165) As I have explained in my article, I do not want the Bhangi to be the indifferent and perfunctory scavenger that he is today.
('70', 144, 2, 17, 286291) I want him to be a healer of ailments, and a physicians besides being an ideal scavenger.
('70', 144, 2, 18, 286381) In ancient times the village barber used to be also the village surgeon.
('70', 144, 2, 19, 286454) I want the good Bhangi to be the village health inspector and physician.
('70', 144, 2, 20, 286527) You have to pave the way for this.
('70', 144, 2, 21, 286562) Today we have reduced him to the lowest level and we have gone down with him.
('70', 144, 2, 22, 286640) He is content to live in squalor and dirt, we are doing no better.
('70', 144, 2, 23, 286707) You cannot reform him unless you reform yourselves, unless you set about the task with a passion that you momentarily import into your studies.
('70', 144, 2, 24, 286851) The task of rural sanitation is no easy one, it means nothing less than raising the village Bhangi to the status of an ideal Bhangi.
('70', 144, 2, 25, 286984) The whole subject is unexplored; the profession, far from being a dirty one, is a purifying, life protecting one.
('70', 144, 2, 26, 287098) Only we have debased it.
('70', 144, 2, 27, 287123) We have to raise it to its true status.
('70', 144, 2, 28, 287163) I have indicated the lines in my article and I will not repeat here what I have said there.

('70', 145, 2, 3, 287379) The reader will find in this issue the full text of the rules 1 framed under the famous Travancore Proclamation opening the State temples to Harijans.
('70', 145, 2, 4, 287530) It is not possible to criticize the rules in anticipation of their application.
('70', 145, 2, 5, 287610) As with all rules, naturally they lend themselves to an interpretation and application as liberal as the Proclamation itself, and to so narrow an interpretation and application as to make the Proclamation wholly ineffective and thus make things worse than before.
('70', 145, 2, 6, 287874) There is no warrant whatsoever for fearing any calamitous result.
('70', 145, 2, 7, 287940) The Proclamation, as I believe it, is in response to the Time Spirit by a Prince imbued with the spirit of reform.
('70', 145, 2, 8, 288055) It has behind it the sanction of popular approval, if what appears in the Press and what I have learnt from persons who should know can be relied upon.
('70', 145, 2, 9, 288207) But as I have already said in these columns the brunt of making the working of the reform successful will fall on the shoulders of the reformers of Travancore.
('70', 145, 2, 10, 288367) It should be possible to create an atmosphere whereby the rules may never need enforcement by authority.
('70', 145, 2, 11, 288472) Temples are generally visited by sincere devotees or hypocrites.
('70', 145, 2, 12, 288537) The former are meticulous in their observance of rules prescribed by custom for fear of losing all merit of temple worship, and the latter have to observe the rules equally meticulously for fear of their being found out.
('70', 145, 2, 13, 288758) Framing of rules such as we have now to deal with is a novelty of the modern age though absolutely necessary.
('70', 145, 2, 14, 288868) When the temple doors are opened by a secular proclamation to thousands of people, it becomes necessary also to frame secular rules for its due enforcement.
('70', 145, 2, 15, 289025) There is no doubt the whole of this great experiment of Travancore requires careful, sympathetic and prayerful handling by all concerned.
('70', 145, 2, 16, 289163) If the spirit behind is purely religious all will be well.
('70', 145, 2, 17, 289222) Who can lead in that direction better than the reformers and the Harijans whom they will bring to those temples?

('70', 146, 2, 6, 289599) I am living in Segaon near Wardha.
('70', 146, 2, 7, 289634) It is not a railway station.
('70', 146, 2, 8, 289663) It has no post office, and no telegraph office.
('70', 146, 2, 9, 289711) All letterrs and telegrams should therefore be addressed to Wardha.

('70', 146, 5, 13, 289842) DEAR DAUGHTER AMTUL SALAAM, I have your letter.
('70', 146, 5, 14, 289890) How shall I please you?
('70', 146, 5, 15, 289914) I have already told you that you can join me after you have recovered.
('70', 146, 5, 16, 289985) I cannot, under present conditions, give you the care you can get at home.
('70', 146, 5, 17, 290060) It is for this reason that I say that your coming to me for the present may not be the right thing.
('70', 146, 6, 18, 290160) I felt tired after writing this, and the letter remained unfinished as visitors came.
('70', 146, 6, 19, 290246) You yourself are the source of your misery.
('70', 146, 6, 20, 290290) When I speak something frankly you take it in the wrong light.
('70', 146, 6, 21, 290353) You fail to see the turn my life has taken.
('70', 146, 6, 22, 290397) I am running no Ashram here and I cannot accommodate here any number of persons I may wish.
('70', 146, 6, 23, 290489) How could it be that I should call you here and not be able to nurse you?
('70', 146, 6, 24, 290563) You might say that you need no nursing, but how could I put up with that?
('70', 146, 6, 25, 290637) I keep no ailing persons here, and to those that are already here I have spoken to the effect that they should go either to Wardha or to their villages.
('70', 146, 6, 26, 290790) Under such conditions what can I tell you?
('70', 146, 6, 27, 290833) Recover and then come.
('70', 146, 6, 28, 290856) If not, tell me where I may arrange to send you for improving you health and I shall do so.
('70', 146, 6, 29, 290948) It was for this reason that I suggested sending you to Bangalore 2. For falling ill also you yourself are to blame.
('70', 146, 6, 30, 291064) You do not even see the reason why I asked Kanti to go to you.

('70', 147, 8, 11, 291851) From far off Kenya, Shri Badiyani, who is a teacher in the Government Indian School there, writes to say: 1
('70', 147, 9, 12, 291959) The tendency of this correspondent of using adjectives such as “the great child educationist” with reference to Shri Gijubhai and of running down an uneducated person like myself, is not worth emulating at all.
('70', 147, 9, 13, 292170) Gijubhai wishes to grow old teaching young boys and girls, so why should he not hand over poor girls to the control of men like himself by piercing or allowing them to pierce their ears and noses?
('70', 147, 9, 14, 292367) If Gijubhai claims to be a great child educationist and does not allow anyone else to share this title, his opinions will have to be carefully weighed.
('70', 147, 9, 15, 292519) In that case it is necessary to know under what circumstances and in which year he had the noses and ears of his own daughters pierced and in which year and in what context he wrote the above letter.
('70', 147, 9, 16, 292719) Let us, for the sake of argument, accept that Gijubhai is a great child educationist.
('70', 147, 9, 17, 292805) Nevertheless, why should we take it for granted that his views can never be wrong?
('70', 147, 9, 18, 292888) Why should we regard utterances of Mahatmas on every occasion as gospel truth?
('70', 147, 9, 19, 292967) How did my advice, which was being acted upon so far, become wrong after the correspondent had seen and read a letter appearing
('70', 147, 10, 20, 293095) 1 The letter is not translated here.
('70', 147, 10, 21, 293132) The correspondent had stated that having read Gijubhai’s views on the subject of piercing the nose and the ears he could no longer agree with Gandhiji’s views on the matter.
('70', 148, 0, 1, 293306) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 149
('70', 148, 1, 2, 293354) under Gijubhai’s name?
('70', 148, 1, 3, 293377) Had Shri Badiyani found anything wrong with the young girls whos noses and ears had not been pierced?
('70', 148, 1, 4, 293479) My advice is that is no matter, whether small or big, should anyone’s opinion be given the importance of a gospel truth.
('70', 148, 1, 5, 293600) Every statement—whether coming from a ‘Mahatma’ like myself or a great child educationist like Gijubhai—should be weighed in the scales of intelligence and one which is more reasonable should be accepted.
('70', 148, 1, 6, 293805) If, later, one comes across even a greater ‘Mahatma’ or a greater Shastri, one should not immediately prostrate oneself before him but remain faithful to the person whom one’s intelligence has accepted.
('70', 148, 1, 7, 294008) This is the meaning of an unwavering intelligence.
('70', 148, 1, 8, 294059) If we do not learn to do so, we shall be left with no faith and our poor intelligence will be rendered ineffective from confusion.
('70', 148, 1, 9, 294190) Let us now consider the basic issue.
('70', 148, 1, 10, 294227) Are only girls fond of jewellery?
('70', 148, 1, 11, 294261) Is this not true of boys?
('70', 148, 1, 12, 294287) What can love of jewellery have to do with the piercing of the nose and the ears?
('70', 148, 1, 13, 294369) In the West, there are innumerable girls whose noses and ears are not pierced, but we do not hear of their lamenting the fact when they grow up.
('70', 148, 1, 14, 294514) If the nose and the ears are to be pierced, how many holes are to be made and why only a specified number of holes?
('70', 148, 1, 15, 294630) What kind of ornaments can be regarded as adornment and when should these be regarded as ugly?
('70', 148, 1, 16, 294725) If the practice of piercing noses and ears is good, then why should we not leave it to the girls to get that done when they are grown up?
('70', 148, 1, 17, 294863) Why increase artificial differences between boys and girls?
('70', 148, 1, 18, 294923) Are there many parents amongst us who get the ears of both their boys and girls pierced?
('70', 148, 1, 19, 295012) Why then show this favour to or inflict this tyranny on girls alone?
('70', 148, 1, 20, 295081) Let me now give my opinion briefly.
('70', 148, 1, 21, 295117) In both my ears, taken together, there were six holes.
('70', 148, 1, 22, 295172) These are still there and I do not like them.
('70', 148, 1, 23, 295218) But how am I to close these up?
('70', 148, 1, 24, 295250) My wife’s nose and ears were pierced.
('70', 148, 1, 25, 295288) She must have resented taking off her ornaments.
('70', 148, 1, 26, 295337) Neither of us feels that either one of us looks less comely for having taken them off.
('70', 148, 1, 27, 295424) If we do not appear comely in the eyes of others, should we have pity for them even in such matters?
('70', 148, 1, 28, 295525) The piercing of the nose and the ears and adorning these with ornaments results in dirt collecting at these places and this sometimes even leads to pus formation.
('70', 148, 1, 29, 295688) The fact that time is wasted in keeping
('70', 149, 0, 1, 295728) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 150
('70', 149, 1, 2, 295770) these clean to avoid such harmful consequences, is also not an unimportant consideration.
('70', 149, 1, 3, 295860) Doctors alone can measure the effect of the pain caused to little children by the piercing of their noses and ears.
('70', 149, 1, 4, 295976) Women, as it is, are slaves.
('70', 149, 1, 5, 296005) In the act of piercing their noses and ears, I have never seen anything but a symbol of their slavery.
('70', 149, 1, 6, 296108) By tying a string to her ear rings, woman can be pulled like a bullock.
('70', 149, 1, 7, 296180) Instances exist of cruel husbands having cut off both the ears and the noses of their wives along with the ornaments in them.
('70', 149, 1, 8, 296306) I invite those who advocate the piercing of the nose and the ears to look at the frightful ornaments on the noses and ears of Indian women and the dirt in them and then advise me as to what I should do.
('70', 149, 1, 9, 296509) Should I have them remove their ornaments or should I advise them to wear ear pendants of pearls in holes large enough for my finger to go through?

('70', 149, 4, 12, 296724) SEGAON, December 6, 1936
('70', 149, 5, 13, 296749) MY DEAR REBEL, Your letters.
('70', 149, 5, 14, 296778) Agatha came in last evening.
('70', 149, 5, 15, 296807) Andrews is here and so is Carl Heath.
('70', 149, 5, 16, 296845) Your two parcels have come.
('70', 149, 5, 17, 296873) I see in them two blankets!
('70', 149, 5, 18, 296901) The white one is in use already.
('70', 149, 5, 19, 296934) Is any of them for the Exhibition?
('70', 149, 5, 20, 296969) The rest, I take it, is for [the] Exhibition.
('70', 149, 5, 21, 297015) The books are valuable.
('70', 149, 5, 22, 297039) What is the letter about articles?
('70', 149, 5, 23, 297074) I think I told you they were not worth publishing—such, i.e., as I had read.
('70', 149, 5, 24, 297151) Shummy’s reply has been received.
('70', 149, 5, 25, 297185) It is good.
('70', 149, 5, 26, 297197) But he can’t bear the separation and he is anxious about your health.
('70', 149, 5, 27, 297267) I have to reach Faizpur not before 20th.
('70', 149, 5, 28, 297308) Hence you will pass through Wardha on your way to Ahmedabad.
('70', 149, 5, 29, 297369) I leave Wardha on 19th evening.
('70', 149, 5, 30, 297401) The weather here is very good.
('70', 149, 5, 31, 297432) I have not seen the lace yet.
('70', 149, 5, 32, 297462) Is it coming in a separate parcel?
('70', 149, 5, 33, 297497) Too busy to say more.
('70', 150, 0, 1, 297519) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 151
('70', 150, 1, 2, 297567) [PS.] Yes, J.’s appeal is splendid.
('70', 150, 1, 3, 297603) I understand what you say about V.S. and Manganwal.
('70', 150, 1, 4, 297655) We must talk about it.

('70', 150, 4, 8, 297782) December 6, 1936
('70', 150, 5, 9, 297799) NARMADA,
('70', 150, 6, 10, 297808) You unworthy girl, you sat before me for hours but could not see that I was pained.
('70', 150, 6, 11, 297892) Could you not see my unshed tears?
('70', 150, 6, 12, 297927) You even forgot what you had told me.
('70', 150, 6, 13, 297965) Carried away by an impulse, you have cast away abiding happiness.
('70', 150, 6, 14, 298031) And now you feel ashamed even to write to me.
('70', 150, 6, 15, 298077) What were your words when you came to the Ashram 1 and what have you done?
('70', 150, 6, 16, 298152) I do not resent your marriage 2. You yourself admit that your relationship cannot be called a marriage.
('70', 150, 6, 17, 298256) Both of you have to seek dharma in this sin.
('70', 150, 6, 18, 298301) I do not say that what I have suggested is the right course.
('70', 150, 6, 19, 298362) At the same time I have no doubt that the path you have chosen is wrong.
('70', 150, 6, 20, 298435) Wake up.
('70', 150, 6, 21, 298444) Perhaps your intellect will fail to understand this but your heart, if it is sound, certainly will.
('70', 150, 6, 22, 298544) This is only in reply to your message.

('70', 150, 10, 26, 298714) SEGAON, WARDHA, December 6, 1936
('70', 150, 11, 27, 298747) BHAI RAMNARAYAN,
('70', 150, 12, 28, 298764) I have your letters.
('70', 150, 12, 29, 298785) Instead of drafting a statement for you from these letters I will write an article 3 and publish it.
('70', 150, 12, 30, 298886) Believe me I weep more than both of you could be doing because all my expectations have been belied.
('70', 150, 12, 31, 298987) Nothing is lost if your repentance is sincere.
('70', 150, 12, 32, 299034) But you cannot atone for what you have done by indulging in pleasure.
('70', 150, 13, 33, 299104) 1 In July 1932; vide “ Letter to Narandas Gandhi”, and “Letter to Narmadabehn Rana”, 16 7 1932 2 With Ramnarayan Pathak.

('70', 151, 1, 2, 299316) still stick to my views.
('70', 151, 1, 3, 299341) You were the guardian of Narmada’s chastity.
('70', 151, 1, 4, 299386) You violated that chastity and while doing so you never thought of what you were doing or what the after effects would be.
('70', 151, 1, 5, 299509) Still, the problem of doing justice to Gangabehn remains.
('70', 151, 1, 6, 299567) If you can become Narmada’s teacher, her life, and also yours, will be saved from ruin and Gangabehn will have peace of mind.
('70', 151, 1, 7, 299693) I do not know Gangabehn.
('70', 151, 1, 8, 299718) Her letter has not impressed me much, though I see that she feels hurt.
('70', 151, 1, 9, 299790) To your brother and Hemubhai the blow is still fresh.
('70', 151, 1, 10, 299844) You will be able to see the light not by lamenting over what you have done but by thinking calmly over it.
('70', 151, 1, 11, 299951) Nothing but ruin can result if you are carried away by your present notion of marriage.
('70', 151, 1, 12, 300039) Will you not pay off your debt to the Harijans?
('70', 151, 2, 13, 300087) Blessings from BAPU

('70', 151, 4, 15, 300183) 174. DISCUSSION WITH STUDENTS OF VILLAGE WORKERS TRAINING SCHOOL 1
('70', 151, 5, 16, 300250) [December 6, 1936] 2
('70', 151, 6, 17, 300271) I have no doubt that this penance 3 willingly undertaken and cheerfully gone through had something to do in bringing about the settlement.
('70', 151, 6, 18, 300410) I do not mean to imply that it had any direct influence upon the Union Government.
('70', 151, 6, 19, 300493) It is my firm belief that all real penances produce unseen but sure effects.
('70', 151, 6, 20, 300570) The penance was undertaken for self purification, for sharing, however humbly, in the suffering of the strikers.
('70', 151, 6, 21, 300683) That was the only way in which I could prayerfully appeal to God.
('70', 151, 7, 22, 300749) 1 Extracted from Mahadev Desai’s “Weekly Letter” 2 According to the source, students of Village Workers’ Training School met Gandhiji on “Sunday last”, which would be December 6. 3 Gandhiji had been asked about the fasts he had undertaken on various occasions, and he had referred to his first fast in connection with a public movement which he had undertaken in 1913, when he had imposed on himself a triple vow of self suffering till the £ 3 tax was abolished: (i) to adopt the labourers’ dress; (ii) to walk barefoot; (iii) to have only one meal during the day—a meal which during those days consisted of fruits untouched by fire.
('70', 151, 7, 23, 301383) This penance went on for some months till the tax was removed.
('70', 152, 0, 1, 301446) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 153
('70', 152, 1, 2, 301494) The man who performs such penances throws himself wholly and solely on God.
('70', 152, 1, 3, 301570) He does not undertake such a penance lightly, never in anger, and not certainly with a view to winning any advantage for himself.
('70', 152, 1, 4, 301700) Then it must not be against an opponent with whom there is no bond of affection.
('70', 152, 1, 5, 301781) Then it presupposes personal purity and a living belief in non violence and truth.
('70', 152, 1, 6, 301864) Obviously there can be no room for pride in such penances.

('70', 152, 3, 10, 302152) The cool weather permits such adventures.
('70', 152, 3, 11, 302194) Andrews was here for four days.
('70', 152, 3, 12, 302226) Dr. Mott and B. Mathews have been to Segaon.
('70', 152, 3, 13, 302271) The discussion centres round the untouchability question, i.e., the propriety of Christian Mission interfering with the internal reform movement which has received a tremendous lift by the action of the Travancore State opening all the temples to Harijans.
('70', 152, 3, 14, 302528) I hope you are keeping extra fit.

('70', 153, 9, 14, 303666) MY DEAR ANAND, I am not angry.
('70', 153, 9, 15, 303697) I am filled with pain and dismay.
('70', 153, 9, 16, 303731) Your letter does not mend matters.
('70', 153, 9, 17, 303766) If you felt for Vidya, your duty was clear even if she was the temptress.
('70', 153, 9, 18, 303840) You were the guardian of her health.
('70', 153, 9, 19, 303877) What I stated about contraceptives was not to suggest that you believed in them.
('70', 153, 9, 20, 303958) It was the measure of my grief that if noble natures like you could not exercise self restraint, the case for contraceptives came to wear the robe of respectability.
('70', 153, 9, 21, 304124) Suppose I yield so to some temptation or pity and a frail woman conceives, will not the case for contraceptives seem to be overwhelming?
('70', 153, 9, 22, 304261) The difference between the two cases will be only one of degree except that my fall will be infinitely more unpardonable than yours.
('70', 153, 9, 23, 304394) You must be as practical as you are sentimental, otherwise your sentiment will be nonsensical and may easily become a weakness and a vice.
('70', 153, 9, 24, 304533) Of course poor Vidya has my blessings.
('70', 153, 9, 25, 304572) Let his name connote your and Vidya’s victory 2 over the flesh.
('70', 153, 9, 26, 304636) Love to you all.

('70', 154, 4, 5, 304938) SEGAON, [December 8, 1936] 2
('70', 154, 5, 6, 304967) Some time ago a group of friends 3who had come from the World Committee of the Y.M.C.A. were on a visit to Segaon .
('70', 154, 5, 7, 305083) these friends, questions were refreshingly fresh .
('70', 154, 5, 8, 305134) .Gandhiji had sat down in the village to better the social and economic condition of the villagers, especially Harijans.
('70', 154, 5, 9, 305255) How exactly was this being done?
('70', 154, 6, 10, 305288) ANSWER: By living in their midst, by having them to work with us and by working for them.
('70', 154, 7, 11, 305378) QUESTION: That is very good.
('70', 154, 7, 12, 305407) But does that create in them any ambition to live higher?
('70', 154, 8, 13, 305465) A. It does.
('70', 154, 9, 14, 305477) Q. Do they have any big hopes for the future?
('70', 154, 10, 15, 305523) A. I do not know but I think it is better that it comes naturally and gradually.
('70', 154, 10, 16, 305604) You may be sure that they feel and know that better times are ahead of them.
('70', 154, 11, 17, 305681) Q. Our problem is quite different; we have a number of difficult problems like secularism, nationalism and immigration.
('70', 154, 11, 18, 305801) Could you give some advice to our young folk?
('70', 154, 12, 19, 305847) A. It would be sheer presumption on my part to offer advice to those whom I do not know except through hearsay, and I am so constituted that I cannot send advice to people whom I do not know through people I do not know.
('70', 154, 13, 20, 306068) Q. We have here delegates from various countries.
('70', 154, 13, 21, 306118) Some of them will go out in separate groups to the people of India and would like to speak to them about conditions in their countries.
('70', 154, 13, 22, 306254) I wonder what Indians would be particularly interested in hearing about?
('70', 154, 14, 23, 306327) 1 Extracted from Mahadev Desai’s “Weekly Letter” 2 The date is from the manuscript of Mahadev Desai’s Diary.

('70', 155, 0, 1, 306494) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 156
('70', 155, 1, 2, 306536) A. I suppose I may say, subject to correction, that they would be more interested in politics than in questions economic or spiritual.
('70', 155, 1, 3, 306671) It may be sad, but that I think is the state of things.
('70', 155, 2, 4, 306727) Q. In connection with the political situation, I dare say they have heard of communism and fascism, about which we are at loggerheads.
('70', 155, 2, 5, 306862) Would they like to hear about Spain?
('70', 155, 3, 6, 306899) A Indeed.
('70', 155, 3, 7, 306909) Our President would not let us remain without hearing about Spain 1
('70', 155, 4, 8, 306977) Q. I see.
('70', 155, 4, 9, 306987) Now I would put the question from the point of view of our own learning things from India.
('70', 155, 4, 10, 307078) We will be going back to America, Europe, Far East.
('70', 155, 4, 11, 307130) What shall we look for here?
('70', 155, 4, 12, 307159) How can we take back with us something of the imperishable asset of the Indian civilization?
('70', 155, 4, 13, 307252) Can we hope to get at the heart of things?
('70', 155, 5, 14, 307295) A. It is a very difficult question, and yet perhaps not so difficult to answer.
('70', 155, 5, 15, 307375) I would ask you to ignore big cities if you would see the heart of India.
('70', 155, 5, 16, 307449) The big cities here are but poor editions of your big cities.
('70', 155, 5, 17, 307511) Therefore you have to go to the villages, and those too not close to cities or to the railway line, but unspoilt by them.
('70', 155, 5, 18, 307633) Go thirty miles from the railway line where people are untouched by post and telegraphs, and you will see that the people show a kind of culture which you miss in the West.
('70', 155, 5, 19, 307806) You will have to see people with the help of the interpreters.
('70', 155, 5, 20, 307869) You will find there relics of art which has not yet perished, you will find culture which is unmistakable but far different from that of the West.
('70', 155, 5, 21, 308016) Then you will take away something that may be worth taking.
('70', 155, 5, 22, 308076) But of course it depends on the angle from which you would see things.
('70', 155, 6, 23, 308147) Q. But how would you describe the elements of culture we should find in the villages?
('70', 155, 7, 24, 308233) A. Will you explain what you mean?
('70', 155, 8, 25, 308268) Q. A gentleman said we should find in Indian villages qualities of age old culture which we should not find in the West.
('70', 155, 8, 26, 308389) Is it in the philosophy of life, or art, or what?
('70', 155, 9, 27, 308439) A. You would therefore want me to describe to you the predominant aspect of our culture.
('70', 155, 9, 28, 308528) Is that what you want?
('70', 155, 10, 29, 308551) Q. Yes.
('70', 155, 11, 30, 308559) A. I would say it is spiritual.
('70', 155, 12, 31, 308591) 1 Civil War had broken out in Spain and Jawaharlal Nehru had been voicing concern for the Spanish Republic.
('70', 156, 0, 1, 308699) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 157
('70', 156, 1, 2, 308747) Q. That leads us to another question.
('70', 156, 1, 3, 308785) One of the questions we are going to discuss is the ‘Impending Challenge of the Will of God to the Youth’.
('70', 156, 1, 4, 308892) Even in the same religion people have different ways of finding the will of God.
('70', 156, 1, 5, 308973) Could you tell us whether the people here are conscious that they are working out the will of God?
('70', 156, 2, 6, 309072) A. They are not, and I am thankful that they are not, because it is natural with them.
('70', 156, 2, 7, 309159) They are not conscious that they are breathing or using their eyesight and yet they are doing it every moment.
('70', 156, 2, 8, 309270) A healthy man will not be thinking or talking of his health.
('70', 156, 2, 9, 309331) In the same way the spirituality here is unconscious of itself.
('70', 156, 2, 10, 309395) It is an inherited culture.
('70', 156, 2, 11, 309423) Thus in a good home they do not know what spirituous liquor is.
('70', 156, 2, 12, 309487) They do not know what it is to be a teetotaller, for they have been that all their lives.
('70', 156, 2, 13, 309577) The words do not occur in their dictionary.
('70', 156, 3, 14, 309621) Q. Japan and India have many things in common.
('70', 156, 4, 15, 309668) A. Well, East is East, but not now.
('70', 156, 4, 16, 309704) Jap an is Americanized.
('70', 156, 4, 17, 309728) In fact Japan is beating America and England hollow in exploiting India.
('70', 156, 4, 18, 309801) You know the quantity of fents that are dumped here by Japan?
('70', 156, 5, 19, 309863) Q. (Taken rather aback) We provide cheap goods, Sir.
('70', 156, 5, 20, 309916) Are they harmful?
('70', 156, 6, 21, 309934) A. I will not say that they are harmful because they are cheap.
('70', 156, 6, 22, 309998) But they leave us poorer.
('70', 156, 7, 23, 310024) Q. It is not good to provide cheap goods?
('70', 156, 8, 24, 310066) You have no business to deprive us of our hands and feet.
('70', 156, 9, 25, 310124) Q. So, then, you are against this machine age.
('70', 156, 10, 26, 310171) A. To say that is to caricature my views.
('70', 156, 10, 27, 310213) I am not against machinery as such, but I am totally opposed to it when it masters us.
('70', 156, 10, 28, 310300) Japan and America and England are doing it today.
('70', 156, 10, 29, 310350) The agreement between India and Japan is a misnomer.
('70', 156, 10, 30, 310403) It is an agreement between England and Japan.
('70', 156, 10, 31, 310449) Japan must wash its hands of this competition.
('70', 156, 10, 32, 310496) It is harmful to us and harmful to you.
('70', 156, 10, 33, 310536) No one can make bond slaves of others without degrading himself.
('70', 156, 10, 34, 310601) Only a few years ago we manufactured our own cloth, and now we get it from Japan and England.
('70', 156, 10, 35, 310695) It is an unnatural position.
('70', 156, 10, 36, 310724) We could make enough cloth for ourselves and the whole world.
('70', 156, 10, 37, 310786) Our country abounds in natural resources.
('70', 156, 10, 38, 310828) There is something most hideously wrong in sending one’s own cotton out and getting manufactured goods.
('70', 156, 10, 39, 310932) Nine crore rupees
('70', 156, 11, 40, 310950) 1 This was said by Mr. Saito.
('70', 157, 0, 1, 310980) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 158
('70', 157, 1, 2, 311022) worth of cattle hides are exported from here only to return to us as manufactured products.
('70', 157, 1, 3, 311114) There is no reason why this should happen.
('70', 157, 2, 4, 311157) Q. You would not industrialize India?
('70', 157, 3, 5, 311195) A. I would indeed, in my sense of the term.
('70', 157, 3, 6, 311239) The village communities should be revived.
('70', 157, 3, 7, 311282) Indian villages produced and supplied to the Indian towns and cities all their wants.
('70', 157, 3, 8, 311368) India became impoverished when our cities became foreign markets and began to drain the villages dry by dumping cheap and shoddy goods from foreign lands.
('70', 157, 4, 9, 311523) Q. You would then go back to the natural economy?
('70', 157, 5, 10, 311573) A. Yes.
('70', 157, 5, 11, 311581) Otherwise I should go back to the city.
('70', 157, 5, 12, 311621) I am quite capable of running a big enterprise, but I deliberately sacrificed the ambition, not as a sacrifice, but because my heart rebelled against it.
('70', 157, 5, 13, 311775) For I should have no share in the spoliation of the nation which is going on from day to day.
('70', 157, 5, 14, 311869) But I am industrializing the village in a different way.
('70', 157, 5, 15, 311926) I shall show you a village product which I am sure compares favourably with American toffee.
('70', 157, 5, 16, 312019) Tell me if you do not prefer this gur (palm juice gur) to American toffee.
('70', 157, 6, 17, 312094) Here a little supply of palm juice gur is distributed to the guests who enjoy it.
('70', 157, 6, 18, 312176) The American lady thoroughly enjoys it .
('70', 157, 6, 19, 312217) her artistic eye catches sight of the palm trees drawn in relief on the wall above the niche in front of her.
('70', 157, 6, 20, 312327) She appreciates it much.
('70', 157, 6, 21, 312352) But there Japan has got plenty to give us.
('70', 157, 6, 22, 312395) In your arts and handicrafts you are matchless.
('70', 157, 7, 23, 312443) Q. But I like the mud floor and the mud walls here.
('70', 157, 8, 24, 312495) A. Oh yes, it keeps us warm in winter and cool in summer.
('70', 157, 9, 25, 312553) Q. That’s what the Germans say about their beer.
('70', 157, 10, 26, 312602) A. So mother earth is our beer.
('70', 157, 10, 27, 312634) Is not that splendid?
('70', 157, 11, 28, 312656) But the American friend was not going to while away the time joking.
('70', 157, 11, 29, 312725) He asked earnestly if Gandhiji would not give a message to youths.
('70', 157, 12, 30, 312792) A. Simply this that 50 years of unbroken practice of non violence to the best of my ability has deepened my faith in it, instead of diminishing it.
('70', 157, 12, 31, 312940) And if my faith is any worth to them, let them not get weak hearted, but be heartened by my faith.
('70', 157, 12, 32, 313039) If that faith went away I should bury myself alive.
('70', 157, 13, 33, 313091) Q. You like the Sermon on the Mount?
('70', 157, 14, 34, 313128) A. Oh yes.
('70', 157, 14, 35, 313139) Even my declaration that I like it is exploited by Christian friends.
('70', 157, 14, 36, 313209) But let that be.
('70', 157, 14, 37, 313226) What do you want to ask?
('70', 158, 0, 1, 313251) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 159
('70', 158, 1, 2, 313299) Q. I would like you to tell me one passage which has given you more satisfaction than any other.
('70', 158, 1, 3, 313396) A. I do not know.
('70', 158, 1, 4, 313414) But I shall give you a passage that I have often quoted to those who came to convert me to Christianity: ‘Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and everything will be added unto you.’ I saw this emphasized in one of Tolstoy’s beautiful stories.
('70', 158, 1, 5, 313677) It gripped me, and also what he wrote underneath it.
('70', 158, 2, 6, 313730) The talk then turned to the modern miracle in Travancore, which Gandhiji said was entirely due to the influence of a great woman.
('70', 158, 2, 7, 313860) The work of the great woman prompted the lady visitor to ask one final question about the women in America.
('70', 158, 3, 8, 313968) Q. Our own women and girls unfortunately do not represent the finest and best in us.
('70', 158, 3, 9, 314053) I wonder if we can reorient our curricula of education for woman, so as to keep her the preserver of the best in us and to enable her to become a good co worker of man.
('70', 158, 3, 10, 314222) Could you give us a thought for our girls?
('70', 158, 3, 11, 314265) A. I believe in the proper education of women.
('70', 158, 3, 12, 314312) But I do believe that woman will not make her contribution to the world by mimicking or running a race with men.
('70', 158, 3, 13, 314425) She can run the race, but she will not rise to the great heights she is capable of by mimicking man.
('70', 158, 3, 14, 314526) She has to be the complement of man.

('70', 158, 6, 17, 314616) SEGAON, WARDHA, December 10/11, 1936
('70', 158, 7, 18, 314653) BHAI KASTURBHAI,
('70', 158, 8, 19, 314670) I am sending herewith my draft of the Award.
('70', 158, 8, 20, 314715) 1 I am still going through the papers.
('70', 158, 8, 21, 314754) As I read them I find that the mill owners do not have any case for the cut, and if they have they have not been able to argue it.
('70', 158, 8, 22, 314885) If you feel that the papers we have received prove their case it is your duty to guide me.
('70', 158, 8, 23, 314976) I will in any case be receiving your Award, which will contain your arguments also.
('70', 158, 8, 24, 315060) If I can understand them I will certainly change my decision.
('70', 158, 8, 25, 315122) I of course take it that in your Award you will not make use of anything that you may know but of which I am ignorant because in that case I will not be able to understand it at all.
('70', 158, 8, 26, 315305) I may have heard many things from the Labour Association, but what can I do so long as they are not recorded in the

('70', 159, 0, 1, 315467) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 160
('70', 159, 1, 2, 315509) I write this not by way of warning but just to know your mind because I shall feel unhappy if both of us do not arrive at the same decision.
('70', 159, 1, 3, 315650) I want to understand your point of view fully but only on the strength of the evidence we have received.
('70', 159, 1, 4, 315755) I do not understand how you can demand a cut in wages so long as the Delhi settlement 1 is not proved unworkable.
('70', 159, 1, 5, 315869) So for me the doors are closed.
('70', 159, 1, 6, 315901) You will realize my difficulties better after reading my Award.
('70', 159, 1, 7, 315965) If you think it is necessary for you to come here, do come.
('70', 159, 1, 8, 316025) If you find that it is necessary to send me a telegram, do that.
('70', 159, 1, 9, 316090) As I hear that you have gone to Ahmedabad, I am sending this to two addresses.
('70', 159, 1, 10, 316169) Send back to me one of the two copies.
('70', 159, 1, 11, 316208) See that we adhere to the time limit of the 15th.

('70', 159, 3, 13, 316285) December 11, 1936 [PS.] I wrote this yesterday.
('70', 159, 3, 14, 316333) As it missed the train in spite of all efforts, I opened it to write about the Umpire.
('70', 159, 3, 15, 316420) That was left out.
('70', 159, 3, 16, 316439) Besides Shri Madgavkar, the other names suggested are Shri Motilal Setalvad and Shri Patkar.
('70', 159, 3, 17, 316532) Shankerlal told me that you approve of Shri Govind Ballabh Pant.

('70', 159, 7, 23, 316744) MY DEAR REBEL,
('70', 159, 8, 24, 316759) I have a moment just now for a love letter.
('70', 159, 8, 25, 316803) I don’t understand the possibility of your missing Wardha en route to Ahmedabad.
('70', 159, 8, 26, 316884) If it is to be with Shummy as long as possible you may drop Wardha assuredly.
('70', 159, 8, 27, 316962) The quickest route from Delhi to Ahmedabad is by metre gauge.
('70', 159, 8, 28, 317024) From Wardha to Ahmedabad, for you Bombay is more convenient.
('70', 159, 8, 29, 317085) Tapti valley is cheaper and quite good.
('70', 159, 9, 30, 317125) 1 Of 13 1 1935. This provided for a reduction of 6 1/2 per cent in the earnings of all time and piece workers and further promised that wages would be standardized and a scheme for adjustment of wages would be framed.

('70', 160, 1, 6, 317521) You will like it except for its somewhat city appearance.
('70', 160, 1, 7, 317579) It has cost more than my hut.
('70', 160, 1, 8, 317609) I am sure that at least Rs. 100 could have been saved on it.
('70', 160, 1, 9, 317670) But I could not control the operations unless I was to give my time which I could not afford.
('70', 160, 1, 10, 317764) But of all this when we meet.

('70', 160, 6, 20, 318110) Who has arranged that?
('70', 160, 6, 21, 318133) Every alternate day I get a basket of fifty.
('70', 160, 6, 22, 318178) That should be stopped.
('70', 160, 6, 23, 318202) What do they cost?
('70', 160, 6, 24, 318221) We should make a deeper study of Mott’s correction 1. I hope Bablo is doing well.

('70', 161, 1, 4, 318962) And after all you wanted to come to me only to pay your respects.
('70', 161, 1, 5, 319028) So what would it have mattered even if I did not speak to you?
('70', 161, 1, 6, 319091) Or even if I despised you?
('70', 161, 1, 7, 319118) It was your duty to pay me your respects, was it not?
('70', 161, 1, 8, 319172) Why should you then have hesitated in observing your dharma?
('70', 161, 1, 9, 319233) You wanted to talk to me, we could have done that also.

('70', 161, 1, 13, 319489) Now you have entered the vana 1. You should be happy.
('70', 161, 1, 14, 319543) You can now hold converse with the trees.

('70', 161, 7, 28, 320066) His office is in Fort, Bombay.
('70', 161, 7, 29, 320097) Maybe Ramdas knows about it.

('70', 162, 2, 3, 320572) December 11, 1936
('70', 162, 3, 4, 320590) BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS,
('70', 162, 4, 5, 320609) I have your two letters in front of me.
('70', 162, 4, 6, 320649) I understand about Parameshwari and I have sent him a copy of your letter advising him to give up the Delhi farm.
('70', 162, 4, 7, 320763) I too understand that the financial aspect is not important.
('70', 162, 4, 8, 320824) The important question for me is one of honour and right judgement.
('70', 162, 4, 9, 320892) I must not abuse your confidence and generosity nor permit anyone else to do so.
('70', 162, 4, 10, 320973) Let us see what happens.
('70', 162, 4, 11, 320998) I understand your point about Travancore.
('70', 162, 4, 12, 321040) Nevertheless it was unnecessary for me to do more than I did.
('70', 162, 4, 13, 321102) I express my impressions as they occur.
('70', 162, 4, 14, 321142) As regards the current developments you will read what I have written in the Harijan.
('70', 162, 5, 15, 321228) Thakkar Bapa writes that you are somewhat indisposed.
('70', 162, 5, 16, 321282) What is it?
('70', 162, 5, 17, 321294) Andy why?
('70', 162, 5, 18, 321304) Dates are coming regularly and the rug has been received.
('70', 162, 5, 19, 321362) It is quite warm.

('70', 162, 10, 24, 321513) BRAJKISAN,
('70', 162, 11, 25, 321524) Mother must have recovered by now.
('70', 162, 11, 26, 321559) Why do you wish to go to the Congress?
('70', 162, 11, 27, 321598) I shall probably reach there on the 20th.
('70', 162, 11, 28, 321640) At present I have no idea where I shall be lodged or how I shall go.
('70', 162, 11, 29, 321709) My idea is to walk from the station.
('70', 162, 11, 30, 321746) If I have room enough and if you have to come you can certainly stay with me.
('70', 162, 11, 31, 321824) But if it is not really necessary for you to come, you should remain there and do some work of service.

('70', 163, 2, 3, 322095) Shri Ishverbhai Amin, Chief Chemist and Technical Superintendent of the Alembic Chemical Works of Baroda, has prepared a chemical analysis of principal cereals and pulses commonly used in Gujarat and a note thereon.
('70', 163, 2, 4, 322311) I give the important part 1 of it below, omitting the detailed analysis as being too technical for the reader.

('70', 163, 4, 7, 322509) 188. GOD IS GREAT
('70', 163, 5, 8, 322527) The following telegram 2 was received at Poona from the Harijan Sevak Sangh, Trivandrum, on the 3rd instant:
('70', 163, 6, 9, 322636) Actual working Proclamation most successful.
('70', 163, 6, 10, 322681) Has disproved all fears entertained certain quarters.
('70', 163, 6, 11, 322735) No part of temple open to any devotee is barred against Ezhavas and Harijans now.
('70', 163, 6, 12, 322817) Excepting innermost chamber which has been always used only by offciating priest, all other places including mandaps, enclosed platforms, corridors are as freely used by newly admitted devotees as by caste Hindus.
('70', 163, 6, 13, 323031) What is of the greatest importance is that waters in sacred tanks attached to temples are also freely used now by Ezhavas and Harijans.
('70', 163, 6, 14, 323167) Sense of horror at approach of Harijans seems completely overcome.
('70', 163, 6, 15, 323234) Harijan devotees do not seem to excite any special reaction in devotees of other castes who engage in worship at the same time.
('70', 163, 6, 16, 323362) Hardly necessary to say that no special hour or any other distinction made against new entrants.
('70', 163, 6, 17, 323459) A hopeful feature is priests and other temple officials genuinely wholeheartedly co operating.
('70', 163, 6, 18, 323554) They do not seem to suffer any mental strain .
('70', 163, 7, 19, 323601) Orthodox people including Namboodiris have as groups or individuals displayed no hostility, most of them expressing themselves in terms of full approval of Proclamation.
('70', 163, 7, 20, 323771) We see no signs whatever of resentment.
('70', 163, 7, 21, 323811) Their behaviour is such as if nothing extraordinary had happened, which from what we know of previous orthodoxy is an astonishing achievement.
('70', 163, 7, 22, 323954) The noble Proclamation has been followed up by thorough execution.
('70', 163, 8, 23, 324021) 1 Not reproduced here.
('70', 163, 8, 24, 324044) 2 Only extracts are reproduced here.
('70', 164, 0, 1, 324081) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 165
('70', 164, 1, 2, 324129) The telegram was received too late for publication in the last issue.
('70', 164, 1, 3, 324199) That is the handicap of having different places of printing and editing.
('70', 164, 1, 4, 324272) When the Temple Entry Proclamation was issued, I had misg ivings which I could not and would not suppress.
('70', 164, 1, 5, 324379) Was it a political document with loopholes and reservations?
('70', 164, 1, 6, 324440) What would be its effect on the caste Hindus, if it was a superimposed thing?
('70', 164, 1, 7, 324518) What would be its effect on Harijans?
('70', 164, 1, 8, 324556) Would it not leave them cold?
('70', 164, 1, 9, 324586) Friends took me to task for not sharing their enthusiasm.
('70', 164, 1, 10, 324644) I could not help it.
('70', 164, 1, 11, 324665) 1 Not that I had any doubt about the genuine desire of H.H. the Maharani, or the Maharaja, or the Diwan Sir C.P. Ramaswamy Ayyar.
('70', 164, 1, 12, 324795) Indeed I had the privilege of meeting the Maharani and her young hope, the present Maharaja, when I was in Travancore years ago.
('70', 164, 1, 13, 324924) The Maharani had even then professed her belief in the reform.
('70', 164, 1, 14, 324987) I had even jokingly asked the boy, as the Maharaja then was, whether he would remove untouchability and throw open temples when he mounted the gadi of Travancore.
('70', 164, 1, 15, 325150) He had enthusiastically said ‘of course’.
('70', 164, 1, 16, 325192) Have I not known Sir C.P. Ramaswamy Ayyar since 1915 or 1916 as a reformer?
('70', 164, 1, 17, 325268) My misgivings had a deeper meaning which I had tried to express.
('70', 164, 1, 18, 325333) It may be that it was my want of faith in the people.
('70', 164, 1, 19, 325387) There certainly was in the adequacy of the effort and purity of reformers working under the aegis of the Harijan Sevak Sangh.
('70', 164, 1, 20, 325513) But the latest happening described in the foregoing telegram with such wealth of detail has dispelled all doubt.
('70', 164, 1, 21, 325626) The rules 2
('70', 164, 2, 22, 325638) reproduced last week have lost their formidableness.
('70', 164, 2, 23, 325691) The actuality has surpassed all expectations.
('70', 164, 2, 24, 325737) The enthusiasm of the Harijans, the absence of all opposition to their entrance to the farthest limit permissble to the highest caste, and the willing, nay, the hearty, co operation of the officiating priests, show the utter genuineness of the great and sweeping reform.
('70', 164, 2, 25, 326008) What seemed impossible for man has been made possible by God.
('70', 164, 2, 26, 326070) Royal proclamations cannot convert tens of thousands of people.
('70', 164, 2, 27, 326134) Here, therefore, is an instance of mass conversion of caste Hindus.
('70', 164, 2, 28, 326202) It is real because it is spontaneous.
('70', 164, 2, 29, 326240) Only a few years ago in Vaikom the caste Hindus had threatened violence if Harijans crossed even certain roads leading to

('70', 165, 1, 3, 326483) Now that very temple has been opened to Harijans on absolutely the same terms as to any caste Hindu.
('70', 165, 1, 4, 326584) And all this without the slightest pressure from anybody.
('70', 165, 1, 5, 326642) What was quoted to me as the Sankara Smriti has given place to the Maharaja Smriti whose validity is proved by the unequivocal response of the caste Hindus as a whole and the equally unequivocal response in another sense by the Harijans.
('70', 165, 1, 6, 326880) Truly, God is great, if we would but open the eyes of our understanding.
('70', 165, 1, 7, 326953) My congratulations to the Maharaja and his good mother and his great Diwan, as also the Hindus of Travancore.
('70', 165, 1, 8, 327063) Let us hope that all caste distinctions, in so far as they connote high and low grades, are things of the past in Travancore.
('70', 165, 1, 9, 327189) If we garner the enthusiasm of Travancore, it cannot be long before the whole of India catches the Travancore spirit.

('70', 165, 5, 17, 327583) My blessing was not available for the act.
('70', 165, 5, 18, 327626) 1 It was and is ever available for you and Vidya.
('70', 165, 5, 19, 327676) And if it means anything let it be a shield against repetition of the blunder.
('70', 165, 5, 20, 327755) Your case has turned me upside down.
('70', 165, 5, 21, 327792) Both of you have led me to bank so much upon you.

('70', 166, 3, 4, 328127) AMTUL SALAAM,
('70', 166, 4, 5, 328141) I am returning your letter.
('70', 166, 4, 6, 328169) There is no doubt that you are mad.
('70', 166, 4, 7, 328205) And you are as suspicious as you are mad.
('70', 166, 4, 8, 328247) How you have completely misread my meaning in the letter.
('70', 166, 4, 9, 328305) I wrote to you about Kanti and you vexed yourself.
('70', 166, 4, 10, 328356) It becomes difficult even to help you.
('70', 166, 4, 11, 328395) Neither Hindus nor Mussalmans despise you.
('70', 166, 4, 12, 328438) Both like you.
('70', 166, 4, 13, 328453) Your brothers love you.
('70', 166, 4, 14, 328477) Then consider Thakkar Bapa, Malkani, Narandas, Prabhavati, Ba, Mira, Mahadev and the rest.
('70', 166, 4, 15, 328568) To Kanti you are a mother.
('70', 166, 4, 16, 328595) There was a time when Kanti could not live without you.
('70', 166, 4, 17, 328651) Now he has got over that infatuation but he still worships you.
('70', 166, 4, 18, 328715) Is there anything which Dr. Ansari has not done for you?
('70', 166, 4, 19, 328772) Khan Saheb is always thinking about you.
('70', 166, 4, 20, 328813) He even hoped that you would spend Ramzan with him.
('70', 166, 4, 21, 328865) Your sister in law worships you.
('70', 166, 4, 22, 328898) Your brothers love you.
('70', 166, 4, 23, 328922) What more do you expect?
('70', 166, 4, 24, 328947) There are very few as fortunate as you.
('70', 166, 4, 25, 328987) A person like Khurshedbehn fawns upon you and Madam Wadia is eager to help you.
('70', 166, 4, 26, 329067) If you wake up and look you will realize that you are mad and therefore unhappy.
('70', 166, 4, 27, 329148) I will leave on the 19th.
('70', 166, 4, 28, 329174) If you wish you can come and see me before that.
('70', 166, 4, 29, 329223) But how will the meeting help you?
('70', 166, 4, 30, 329258) If you want to get treated here, I can definitely make the arrangement.
('70', 166, 4, 31, 329330) In that case you can’t keep running from place to place and will have to live as I say, eat what I prescribe and do what I ask you to do.

('70', 167, 1, 3, 329951) He could not satisfy me and I could not satisfy him.
('70', 167, 1, 4, 330004) I told him that you did everything after consulting me and with my consent and that therefore if he had any differences of opinion with you he should discuss them with me.
('70', 167, 1, 5, 330176) After this there was nothing for him but to argue with me.
('70', 167, 1, 6, 330235) Then I learnt that there was a great gulf between his views and mine.
('70', 167, 1, 7, 330305) Ultimately he left.
('70', 167, 1, 8, 330325) I gave him the return fare.
('70', 167, 1, 9, 330353) He had said that in order to get justice he might resort to satyagraha, that is, undertake a fast.
('70', 167, 1, 10, 330452) Of course I explained to him the impropriety and the immorality of such a step.
('70', 167, 1, 11, 330532) Let me know if he does anything or says anything.
('70', 167, 1, 12, 330582) I am hoping that he will be quiet now and find some other work.
('70', 167, 1, 13, 330646) I understand about Keshu.
('70', 167, 1, 14, 330672) I have always held your opinion in high esteem and therefore I will have to consider the whole episode again.
('70', 167, 1, 15, 330782) I went through the letters of Lakshmidas, but I was not impressed by them as you were.
('70', 167, 1, 16, 330869) The reason may be that I was not able to read them carefully.
('70', 167, 1, 17, 330931) Now I will do so.

('70', 167, 6, 28, 331413) If you nurse anger even in your heart, you will lose the merit or reward of living under a tree.

('70', 168, 1, 3, 331979) How many we shall be will depend on the reply that we get from there.
('70', 168, 1, 4, 332049) You seem to be entertaining Vinoba very well.
('70', 168, 1, 5, 332095) See that you do not fall ill again.
('70', 168, 1, 6, 332131) If one works within one’s limits, one can do more work and the work shines out.

('70', 168, 6, 12, 332438) AMBUJAM, I am very happy that Tulsidas’s Ramayana is being translated into Tamil by you.
('70', 168, 6, 13, 332527) Your noble effort will enable the Tamil knowing people to have the benefit of the unrivalled prasadi of Tulsidas.

('70', 168, 9, 17, 332749) 194. NEED FOR CLEANSING OF HEART
('70', 168, 10, 18, 332782) One of the two Harijan workers about whose downfall I have been writin is Shri Ramnarayan Pathak, who was the soul of the Porbundar Chhaya Harijan Ashram.
('70', 168, 10, 19, 332937) I had some talk and some correspondence with him.
('70', 168, 10, 20, 332987) He has now written me the following letter: 1
('70', 168, 11, 21, 333033) The letter of December 3 is really long.
('70', 168, 11, 22, 333074) I have not summarized it.
('70', 168, 11, 23, 333100) It is not easy to do so.
('70', 168, 11, 24, 333125) Even if I published the whole letter it could possibly serve no useful purpose.
('70', 168, 11, 25, 333205) I believe it is harmful to satisfy a morbid curiosity which seeks pleasure in finding faults with others.
('70', 168, 11, 26, 333311) I do not therefore wish to put unnecessary details before the readers.
('70', 168, 11, 27, 333382) Some persons calling themselves friends and well wishers of Shri
('70', 168, 12, 28, 333447) 1 Not translated here.
('70', 168, 12, 29, 333470) The correspondent, anxious to atone for his misdemeanour, had requested Gandhiji to prepare a confession on his behalf and if he so chose to publish it in Harijanbandhu.
('70', 169, 0, 1, 333640) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 170
('70', 169, 1, 2, 333682) Ramnarayan have gently chided me.
('70', 169, 1, 3, 333716) This was out of place as I had not given the name or address.
('70', 169, 1, 4, 333778) What I had written was not written without thought or cause.
('70', 169, 1, 5, 333839) However, what Shri Ramnarayan, unable to bear the burden of his guilt, has confessed is far more serious than I had realized.
('70', 169, 1, 6, 333965) I do not repent the habit I have formed since many years of not hiding my own faults or of those dear to me.
('70', 169, 1, 7, 334074) This has only been to the good of the persons concerned and others.
('70', 169, 1, 8, 334142) I have not concealed the failings of my late father, nor those of my wife, nor those of my sons.
('70', 169, 1, 9, 334239) My own failings every reader knows by heart.
('70', 169, 1, 10, 334284) Lest I forget, people, some in good faith, some others to condemn me, keep on reminding me of them.
('70', 169, 1, 11, 334384) By making my failings public I have learnt to avoid them.
('70', 169, 1, 12, 334442) However hard anyone may try secretly to be pure, he will never succeed.
('70', 169, 1, 13, 334514) Why should God’s creation not see the faults which God sees?
('70', 169, 1, 14, 334575) Anyone who is really ashamed of his failings will be safe only by making them public and having his own co workers to protect him.
('70', 169, 1, 15, 334706) This is what is meant by depending on God.
('70', 169, 1, 16, 334749) I must confess that many a time if I have saved myself from a heinous deed it was because of my friends and children.
('70', 169, 1, 17, 334867) If I gave in to weakness what would happen to them?
('70', 169, 1, 18, 334919) If they came to know of it in the case of a man to whom they looked for support, the support would collapse.
('70', 169, 1, 19, 335028) This reflection saved me.
('70', 169, 1, 20, 335054) This is what is called God’s protection.
('70', 169, 1, 21, 335095) This is what is meant by Rama being the strength of the weak.
('70', 169, 1, 22, 335157) We can escape from the net spread by the senses only if we admit our failings.
('70', 169, 1, 23, 335236) It is for this very reason that making public our faults is the first step towards purification.
('70', 169, 1, 24, 335333) Bhai Ramnarayan was already well established in the field of social service when I came to know him.
('70', 169, 1, 25, 335434) Even at that first meeting, I did not see frankness or innocence in his eyes or on his face.
('70', 169, 1, 26, 335527) But Thakkar Bapa had recommended him so strongly that disregarding the impression he had made on me I gave him my blessings.
('70', 169, 1, 27, 335652) After that, however, I too like Thakkar Bapa became an admirer of Shri Ramanarayan.
('70', 169, 1, 28, 335736) When I wanted to give an instance of an ideal Harijan worker I often cited the name of Shri Ramnarayan.
('70', 169, 1, 29, 335840) Just as I regard many young men and women as my sons and daughters, even so did I regard Shri Ramnarayan as my son.
('70', 169, 1, 30, 335956) As for Narmada, she may be said to have come to me while still an infant.
('70', 169, 1, 31, 336030) I became her father and also her mother, as she needed a mother’s affection as well.
('70', 169, 1, 32, 336115) So the readers can well imagine the blow which I suffered.
('70', 169, 1, 33, 336174) They will also understand the purpose of this article.
('70', 169, 1, 34, 336229) The hopes which I had
('70', 170, 0, 1, 336251) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 171
('70', 170, 1, 2, 336299) entertained about Narmada have now been blown away within a fraction of a second like a particle of dust in the wind.
('70', 170, 1, 3, 336417) When the first complaint against Ramnarayan reached me, my heart would not let me to believe it.
('70', 170, 1, 4, 336514) I smelt Kathiawari rivalry in these.
('70', 170, 1, 5, 336551) I, therefore, sent those letters for verification.
('70', 170, 1, 6, 336602) I was showered with evidence.
('70', 170, 1, 7, 336632) Much of the twofold sin which Shri Ramnarayan had been concealing for a long time came to light and he left Chhaya, along with Narmada.
('70', 170, 1, 8, 336768) Narmada is still a child.
('70', 170, 1, 9, 336794) I still consider her to be innocent.
('70', 170, 1, 10, 336831) She has a kind of courage, but lacks determination.
('70', 170, 1, 11, 336883) I do not think she is one who would deliberately commit a sin.
('70', 170, 1, 12, 336946) That girl became the victim of Shri Ramnarayan’s lust.
('70', 170, 1, 13, 337001) Although she strove with him she fell.
('70', 170, 1, 14, 337040) Now both of them have married.
('70', 170, 1, 15, 337071) Another girl who was also involved with him at the same time is left in the lurch.
('70', 170, 1, 16, 337154) In giving this account my aim is not to dwell on Shri Ramnarayan’s failings.
('70', 170, 1, 17, 337231) I believe that he has done all this because he was blinded by lust.
('70', 170, 1, 18, 337299) It could not possibly have happened without the parctice of falsehood, and so the thing continued undetected.
('70', 170, 1, 19, 337409) But seldom can one hide one’s guilt till the very end.
('70', 170, 1, 20, 337464) Those whose failings come to light, should be regarded as blessed.
('70', 170, 1, 21, 337531) This is precisely what has happened in the case of Shri Ramnarayan.
('70', 170, 1, 22, 337599) He is right in saying that he will be unable to purify himself even by the most candid confession.
('70', 170, 1, 23, 337698) He has fallen so deep into the pit of lust that he has become almost incapable of coming out of it.
('70', 170, 1, 24, 337798) Marriage gives a kind of outward peace.
('70', 170, 1, 25, 337838) Indulgence assumes a new and fuller form.
('70', 170, 1, 26, 337880) I know that those who hold modern views regarding the relationship between man and woman will not like this language.
('70', 170, 1, 27, 337998) However, nothing is written in this journal with a view to pleasing anyone.
('70', 170, 1, 28, 338074) I on my part do not have this aim in writing.
('70', 170, 1, 29, 338120) I would be happy if I could please everyone while keeping Satyanarayana 1 with me.
('70', 170, 1, 30, 338203) However, even if I cannot do so, I would not write anything which Satyanarayan would not tolerate.
('70', 170, 1, 31, 338302) I do know what Bhai Ramnarayan’s views are at the moment.
('70', 170, 1, 32, 338360) According to his letter of December 3, Shri Ramnarayan does not regard his marriage with Narmada as something improper.
('70', 170, 1, 33, 338480) However, his letter which I have published suggests that he is restless in his mind, he cannot see his way clearly.

('70', 171, 0, 1, 338613) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 172
('70', 171, 1, 2, 338655) I believe that his mental agitation is sincere.
('70', 171, 1, 3, 338703) Narmada is not his sahadharmini 1 Where there is no dharma, how can there be anyone to share it?
('70', 171, 1, 4, 338800) She is truly a helpless woman.
('70', 171, 1, 5, 338831) It is only by guiding her and by making her dreams of service come true that he can serve her and atone for the wrongs done to her.
('70', 171, 1, 6, 338963) Shri Ramnarayan can also fulfil his dharma of doing justice to the other girl by shedding impurity from his heart.
('70', 171, 1, 7, 339078) And what about the debt to the harijans?
('70', 171, 1, 8, 339119) My heart fills with pain when I think of this.
('70', 171, 1, 9, 339166) What a wide gap between Ramnarayan, the mature servant of Harijans and Ramnarayan the slave to sexual desire!
('70', 171, 1, 10, 339276) However, many slaves of this kind have attained liberation through sustained effort.
('70', 171, 1, 11, 339361) Many have extricated themselves from the pit of sins.
('70', 171, 1, 12, 339415) What alligator had caught the king of elephants?
('70', 171, 1, 13, 339464) The latter was not a four footed elephant with a trunk.
('70', 171, 1, 14, 339520) He was a human being with two feet, like any one of us.
('70', 171, 1, 15, 339576) The elephant was getting more and more entangled because of his own strength.
('70', 171, 1, 16, 339654) But when his strength failed him, God came to his rescue and liberated him.
('70', 171, 1, 17, 339730) The Gajendramoksha is not merely a poem.
('70', 171, 1, 18, 339771) For those like us it is a consolation, it is a protecting hedge.
('70', 171, 1, 19, 339836) Those readers who, on reading this article, condemn Ramnarayan will not gain anything.
('70', 171, 1, 20, 339923) All readers should pray for his purity, but even more important than this is that keeping this incident in mind, they should ever remain vigilant, should never conceal a weakness, should never entertain pride and think that if ever they should be in a similar predicament they would not get caught in the net.
('70', 171, 1, 21, 340233) Pride has never helped anyone.
('70', 171, 1, 22, 340264) He alone is triumphant whose heart is in the right place till the very end.

('70', 172, 7, 13, 341228) I have your letter.
('70', 172, 7, 14, 341248) Yes, I do study your figures.
('70', 172, 7, 15, 341278) I write nothing, as I have nothing to complain about.
('70', 172, 7, 16, 341332) I did remark about Tyagiji and asked V. Hari to speak to you about him.
('70', 172, 7, 17, 341404) His goodness is undoubted.
('70', 172, 7, 18, 341431) But he is lazy and lives in dreamland.
('70', 172, 7, 19, 341470) Why does he need Rs. 15 when he gets food and lodging?
('70', 172, 7, 20, 341525) He used to ask for nothing at the Ashram.
('70', 172, 7, 21, 341567) He has no needs.
('70', 172, 7, 22, 341584) His son is working.
('70', 172, 7, 23, 341604) Rajkishori is well able to support herself.

('70', 172, 7, 25, 341770) I fear he is getting more.
('70', 172, 7, 26, 341797) If you like I shall write to him.
('70', 172, 7, 27, 341831) I did write to him about his work.

('70', 174, 6, 10, 344306) SURENDRA, 1
('70', 174, 7, 11, 344318) Manu writes to your regularly, so I do not write.
('70', 174, 7, 12, 344368) I write today because of two things Kanti has mentioned in his letter.
('70', 174, 7, 13, 344439) You do not take milk and you have become somewhat impatient to get married.
('70', 174, 7, 14, 344515) I do not say that the two things are related.
('70', 174, 7, 15, 344561) You should never give up milk.
('70', 174, 7, 16, 344592) The reason given by Kisorelal is also not correct.
('70', 174, 7, 17, 344643) For one who is having discharges the thing required is purity of mind and, as external remedy, the hip bath.
('70', 174, 7, 18, 344752) When do you wish to get married?
('70', 174, 7, 19, 344785) As Kanti understands it, you think the sooner it is the better.
('70', 174, 7, 20, 344849) Let me know your wishes frankly.
('70', 174, 7, 21, 344882) I can then consult the other elders and do what is proper.
('70', 174, 7, 22, 344941) Where would you prefer to have the wedding soleminzed, at Wardha only or would Segaon also do?
('70', 174, 7, 23, 345036) Write to me without hesitation.

('70', 174, 11, 28, 345266) Yes, have the meeting on the dates mentioned.
('70', 174, 11, 29, 345312) I was told the opening was on 23rd.

('70', 175, 10, 12, 345968) I do hear about you but it is good that you yourself wrote.
('70', 175, 10, 13, 346028) It is indeed welcome news to me that you are getting steadier in mind and that all three of you keep quite well.
('70', 175, 10, 14, 346141) May all your noble aspirations be fulfilled.
('70', 175, 10, 15, 346186) Those who have grown up in the Ashram or have been supported by it are for the present at any rate abandoning the Ashram ideals.
('70', 175, 10, 16, 346315) I feel very good when at such a time I find anyone clinging to those ideals.
('70', 175, 10, 17, 346392) You seem to have greatly improved your handwriting.

('70', 176, 4, 5, 346703) I have prepared a reply to your telegram.
('70', 176, 4, 6, 346745) It will be despatched tomorrow.
('70', 176, 4, 7, 346777) It is now 8. 30 p.m.

('70', 176, 4, 9, 346890) If I find the need of discussion, I will give you trouble.
('70', 176, 4, 10, 346949) I on my part have not showed my draft to anyone connected with the Labour Association.
('70', 176, 4, 11, 347036) I thought I might acquaint Shankerlal with it after we had given our Awards.
('70', 176, 4, 12, 347113) Whether that happens or not, I quite agree with you that if we have to go to the Umpire neither of the parties should divulge anything about our decision till the Award is made public.
('70', 176, 4, 13, 347298) Please write and inform the parties concerned on behalf of both of us from there.
('70', 176, 5, 14, 347380) Vandemataram from MOHANDAS [PS.] I will reach Faizpur on the 20th.
('70', 176, 5, 15, 347447) My stay there will last at least for nine days.

('70', 176, 9, 21, 347725) MY DEAR IDIOT,
('70', 176, 10, 22, 347740) How idiotic of you to disappoint me at the last moment.
('70', 176, 10, 23, 347796) But it is good.
('70', 176, 10, 24, 347812) Duty before everything else.
('70', 176, 10, 25, 347841) To pass through Wardha was no part of duty.
('70', 176, 10, 26, 347885) It was pleasure to be derived in the course of due performance of duty.
('70', 176, 10, 27, 347957) From what you say it seems that the two cotton quilts are also for me, not for the Exhibition.
('70', 176, 10, 28, 348052) When J. comes he shall have the fulkaris.
('70', 177, 0, 1, 348094) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 178
('70', 177, 1, 2, 348136) Yes, I know Natesan very well.
('70', 177, 1, 3, 348167) I can certainly write to him.
('70', 177, 1, 4, 348197) But I would like you to tackle him once more.
('70', 177, 1, 5, 348243) Let me know the result.
('70', 177, 1, 6, 348267) I shall try if you fail.
('70', 177, 1, 7, 348292) Your account of the Manga[n]wal visit with Agatha is interesting.
('70', 177, 1, 8, 348358) But you must not get tired.
('70', 177, 1, 9, 348386) Why strain yourself?
('70', 177, 1, 10, 348407) You won’t acquire merit by overstraining or even straining yourself.
('70', 177, 1, 11, 348476) Why not be satisfied with the use of energy God has given?
('70', 177, 1, 12, 348535) Overuse is as much abuse as wrong use or underuse.
('70', 177, 1, 13, 348586) Does this penetrate your idiotic brain?
('70', 177, 1, 14, 348626) If it does, why not act accordingly?
('70', 177, 1, 15, 348663) I leave here on 19th for Faizpur.
('70', 177, 1, 16, 348697) They are pressing me to go to Travancore to follow up the temple entry.
('70', 177, 2, 17, 348769) ROBBER [PS.] It seems now certain that I must go to Travancore during first week of January.

('70', 177, 7, 26, 349203) If Dharmadhikari is there he should come and see me, otherwise anyone who is there.

('70', 178, 3, 8, 349769) I also want a wall calendar.
('70', 178, 3, 9, 349798) This was a digression.

('70', 178, 6, 15, 350049) December 15, 1936 When our speech and actions strive faithfully to follow our thoughts, our speech cannot fully describe those thoughts nor is the meaning of our actions fully conveyed by our words.
('70', 178, 6, 16, 350248) When I describe in words a table of my conception the description falls short of the conception and, when it is made, the product falls short of the description.
('70', 178, 6, 17, 350410) Euclid’s straight line exists only in conception.
('70', 178, 6, 18, 350460) Its definition is only a part of the conception and its figure again a part of the definition.
('70', 178, 6, 19, 350555) If this cannot explain what I want to say, you can delete the bracketed portion without fear of break in the continuity of thought.

('70', 180, 2, 3, 351937) [December 16, 1936] 2
('70', 180, 3, 4, 351959) The chief value of Hinduism lies in holding the actual belief that all life (not only human beings, but all sentient beings) is one, i.e., all life coming from the One universal source, call it Allah, God or Parameshwara.
('70', 180, 3, 5, 352181) There is in Hinduism a scripture called Vishnus ahasranama which simply means ‘one thousand names of God’.
('70', 180, 3, 6, 352288) These one thousand names do not mean that God is limited to those names, but that He has as many names as you can possibly give Him.
('70', 180, 3, 7, 352421) You may give Him as many names as you like provided it is one God without a second, whose name you are invoking.
('70', 180, 3, 8, 352534) That also means that He is nameless too.
('70', 180, 3, 9, 352575) This unity of all life is a peculiarity of Hinduism which confines salvation not to human beings alone but says that it is possible for all God’s creatures.
('70', 180, 3, 10, 352732) It may be that it is not possible, save through the human form, but that does not make man the Lord of creation.
('70', 180, 3, 11, 352845) It makes him the servant of God’s creation.
('70', 180, 3, 12, 352889) Now when we talk of brotherhood of man, we stop there, and feel that all other life is there for man to exploit for his own purposes.
('70', 180, 3, 13, 353023) But Hinduism excludes all exploitation.
('70', 180, 3, 14, 353063) There is no limit whatsoever to the measure of sacrifice that one may make in order to realize this oneness with all life, but certainly the immensity of the ideal sets a limit to your wants.
('70', 180, 3, 15, 353255) That, you will see, is the antithesis of the position of the modern civilization which says: ‘Increase your wants’.
('70', 180, 3, 16, 353371) Those who hold that belief think that increase of wants means an increase of knowledge whereby you understand the Infinite better.
('70', 180, 3, 17, 353502) On the contrary Hinduism rules out indulgence and multiplication of wants as these hamper one’s growth to the ultimate identity with the Universal Self.

('70', 181, 3, 4, 354050) MY DEAR IDIOT, So you will receive this in Ahmedabad.
('70', 181, 3, 5, 354104) You will go to the Harijan Ashram and speak to the girls, the cattle and the trees of which there was not a trace when I took the land.
('70', 181, 3, 6, 354240) There was a solitary neem tree, I think.
('70', 181, 3, 7, 354281) You will see old Ramji, the Harijan, and his tall wife.
('70', 181, 3, 8, 354337) And you will see also some familiar faces.
('70', 181, 3, 9, 354380) Anandi, I think you know.
('70', 181, 3, 10, 354406) And you must see the Vidyapith and the labour work of Anasuyabai.
('70', 181, 3, 11, 354472) You should see her indigenous kindergarten for the Harijan brats.
('70', 181, 3, 12, 354538) Of course you will see Mridula’s Jyoti Sangh.
('70', 181, 3, 13, 354584) The other things will be shown to you in the usual manner.
('70', 181, 3, 14, 354643) Don’t bury yourself in the routine work, though that can’t be neglected, I know.
('70', 181, 3, 15, 354724) But you must learn the art of doing things without fretting and feeling the strain.
('70', 181, 3, 16, 354808) What a long drawn out sermon this letter has become?
('70', 181, 3, 17, 354861) You will be quite comfortable with me in Faizpur.

('70', 181, 8, 25, 355166) AMTUL SALAAM, I have received your telegram.
('70', 181, 8, 26, 355211) Why do you insist on coming to Faizpur?
('70', 181, 8, 27, 355251) Come to see me at Segaon and talk to me there.
('70', 181, 8, 28, 355298) You may stay on if you like the place.
('70', 181, 8, 29, 355337) Why do you have misgivings when I have already told you that I shall keep you in Segaon?
('70', 181, 8, 30, 355426) In spite of all this if you want to come to Faizpur do come.
('70', 181, 8, 31, 355487) I expect to be back in Segaon on the 29th.
('70', 181, 8, 32, 355530) Blessings from BAPU

('70', 182, 1, 2, 355641) 214. LETTER TO LILAVATI ASAR
('70', 182, 2, 3, 355670) December 18, 1936
('70', 182, 4, 4, 355688) I have your letter.
('70', 182, 4, 5, 355708) Why do you worry?
('70', 182, 4, 6, 355726) Worrying will not help you to lessen your brother’s suffering.
('70', 182, 4, 7, 355789) Why should you worry?
('70', 182, 4, 8, 355811) Death, life and recovery from illness depend on God alone.
('70', 182, 4, 9, 355870) It is our dharma to live, to get well or to make an effort in that direction, and we have to discharge it.
('70', 182, 4, 10, 355977) Why should you worry while discharging your dharma?
('70', 182, 4, 11, 356029) Know for certain that worry is an obstacle in the path of dharma.
('70', 182, 4, 12, 356095) Take it that prayers, bhajans, and so on are useless if they do not teach us to remain unperturbed under all circumstances.
('70', 182, 4, 13, 356219) Why can’t you call Dinshaw to the hospital?
('70', 182, 4, 14, 356263) Seek the doctor’s permission.
('70', 182, 4, 15, 356293) He will give it.
('70', 182, 4, 16, 356310) Take his permission for the treatment also.
('70', 182, 4, 17, 356354) At least meet Dinshaw.
('70', 182, 4, 18, 356377) Talk to him, get the necessary information, find out his visiting days.
('70', 182, 4, 19, 356449) We should build the dam before the floods.
('70', 182, 4, 20, 356492) We should not start digging a well when the house catches fire; we should have one ready beforehand.
('70', 182, 4, 21, 356593) Do not create unnecessary trouble.
('70', 182, 4, 22, 356628) Do not talk loudly.
('70', 182, 4, 23, 356648) Give thought to whatever you do.
('70', 182, 4, 24, 356681) Do not blurt out whatever comes to your mind.
('70', 182, 4, 25, 356727) Put up with what you cannot help.
('70', 182, 4, 26, 356761) I hope that Damayanti has patience and courage.
('70', 182, 4, 27, 356809) You have not given the name of the hospital.

('70', 182, 9, 32, 357006) MAHADEV,
('70', 182, 10, 33, 357015) Babla’s handwriting, one can say, has improved.
('70', 182, 10, 34, 357063) But he has forgotten quite a lot of what he had learnt.
('70', 182, 10, 35, 357119) I hope you have received and despatched the telegram to Kasturbhai.
('70', 182, 10, 36, 357187) I have received a fair number of copies of Ishopanishad.

('70', 183, 1, 2, 357286) I expect to reach there at about 7.30 tomorrow.
('70', 183, 1, 3, 357334) Navin will come with Ba.
('70', 183, 1, 4, 357359) So for the present three of us and Mehrtaj will go.

('70', 183, 5, 9, 357546) December 18, 1936
('70', 183, 6, 10, 357564) BHAI NANABHAI, 1
('70', 183, 7, 11, 357581) I am glad you wrote me the two letters.
('70', 183, 7, 12, 357621) You should not have any hesitation in writing to me.
('70', 183, 7, 13, 357674) About the first letter, Kishorelal has taken the responsibility.
('70', 183, 7, 14, 357739) Now about the second letter.
('70', 183, 7, 15, 357768) I feel that it is right that we should know even our seniors as they are.
('70', 183, 7, 16, 357842) It has been my experience that since we do not know many of them, we form an exaggerated opinion of them, and as a result the significance of brahmacharya is undermined.
('70', 183, 7, 17, 358012) The idea of brahmacharya will lose its lustre if people consider me a brahmachari since childhood.
('70', 183, 7, 18, 358111) A man who is pure of mind, speech, body and temper has a lustre all his own.
('70', 183, 7, 19, 358188) Where can we find such brahmacharis these days?
('70', 183, 7, 20, 358236) The influence of our seniors does not suffer if we know them as they are, but if they conceal their shortcomings the impression they make on us will only be superficial.
('70', 183, 7, 21, 358406) The question of self control does not arise as I am against artificial means of birth control.
('70', 183, 7, 22, 358501) However, I quite agree with your view that even if that knowledge is worth acquiring it should be disseminated in a restrained manner.
('70', 183, 7, 23, 358636) There is no doubt whatsoever that the friendship between men and women should not exceed a limit.
('70', 183, 7, 24, 358734) Of course it is difficult to draw a line.
('70', 183, 7, 25, 358776) Moreover, such a limit cannot be universal and absolute.
('70', 183, 7, 26, 358833) I hope you are keeping well.

('70', 184, 3, 4, 359114) TARI, I feel like writing: ‘How shall I make you understand?’ Will you wake up only when your condition becomes utterly hopeless?
('70', 184, 3, 5, 359244) To improve your health you should make up your mind to get well at least to the extent of two annas in a rupee.
('70', 184, 3, 6, 359356) Why do you lose hope?
('70', 184, 3, 7, 359378) If you are giving much help there, then do stay on.
('70', 184, 3, 8, 359430) I will not say anything.
('70', 184, 3, 9, 359455) Tell Nanabhai that Kishorelal has taken the responsibility of dealing with his long letter, so I have not written anything to him.

('70', 184, 7, 13, 359713) December 18, 1936
('70', 184, 8, 14, 359731) BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS, I am glad that you liked my article this time.
('70', 184, 8, 15, 359797) But the fact is that I can write only what I feel and that is as it should be.
('70', 184, 8, 16, 359876) As soon as I received Ramachandran’s telegram from Travancore I felt it was my duty to go.
('70', 184, 8, 17, 359967) Why not see Sir Akbar, too, as you saw the Travancore authorities?
('70', 184, 8, 18, 360034) Why should we not discuss with the Viceroy and other officials the need for a law?
('70', 184, 8, 19, 360117) Maybe a law is necessary to open the Guruvayur temple.
('70', 184, 8, 20, 360172) What is needed is for someone to offer the advice.
('70', 184, 8, 21, 360223) Will not Malaviyaji agree even now?
('70', 184, 8, 22, 360259) I completely forgot about Parnerkar.
('70', 184, 8, 23, 360296) I shall try to send him.
('70', 184, 8, 24, 360321) I leave tomorrow for Faizpur.
('70', 184, 8, 25, 360351) Parnerkar is there.
('70', 184, 8, 26, 360371) I shall write to you further after seeing him.
('70', 184, 8, 27, 360418) I have accepted your opinion regarding Parameshwari for I have nothing definite to suggest.
('70', 184, 8, 28, 360510) I do have a feeling, thorough, that Param eshwari might be allowed to conduct his experiment by turning the present company into a public association.
('70', 184, 8, 29, 360661) I think his idea of improving the breed is not ill founded and he is interested in the
('70', 185, 0, 1, 360748) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 186
('70', 185, 1, 2, 360790) He has also obtained favourable opinions of the other experts.
('70', 185, 1, 3, 360853) My bias is certainly in his favour but how can I be certain?
('70', 185, 1, 4, 360914) I know him only through you people.

('70', 185, 4, 8, 361081) 219. A PAINFUL DUTY
('70', 185, 5, 9, 361101) I publish the following without any alteration: 1
('70', 185, 6, 10, 361151) An open letter to Mahatma Gandhi:
('70', 185, 7, 11, 361185) DEAR MAHATMAJI,
('70', 185, 8, 12, 361201) I was shocked to read your note 2 about myself in the Harijan of 21 11 1936 which contains untrue statements about me.
('70', 185, 8, 13, 361320) I am not “carrying on Harijan work near Cuttack” nor did I “come down to Bombay to make the usual collections” nor “as a rule, I consult you before going out for collections”.
('70', 185, 9, 14, 361496) I make the following statements in repudiation and correction of your statement which appeared in Harijan of 21 11 1936. Though I was at one time at Sabarmati Ashram, never received any help from you nor any mandate to carry on Harijan work or any other work near Cuttack or anywhere else.
('70', 185, 9, 15, 361786) I have not been carrying on Harijan work near Cuttack.
('70', 185, 9, 16, 361841) I never consulted you before going out for colleciton for Sevashram started by me and named by me in your honour.
('70', 185, 9, 17, 361955) It has no connection with or dependence on any Congress institution nor with you.
('70', 185, 9, 18, 362037) On my return from Sabarmati in the year 1921, I had an idea of serving the country on the line which you were preaching.
('70', 185, 9, 19, 362158) When some complaints reached you 18 months ago, you wrote to me and I gave you a suitable reply, solemnly negativing the allegations.
('70', 185, 9, 20, 362292) There the duty which I owe to you has ended as far as I and my Ashram are concerned.
('70', 185, 9, 21, 362377) You are free to make any investigation you like .
('70', 185, 9, 22, 362427) I remain, Dated Cuttack, Yours truly, the 6th Dec.
('70', 185, 9, 23, 362478) 1936 GOVIND CHANDRA MISRA
('70', 185, 10, 24, 362504) I would have suppressed the letter if the author had not invited publicity.
('70', 185, 10, 25, 362580) To publish it is a painful task, to comment on it a painful duty.
('70', 185, 11, 26, 362646) 1 Only extracts are reproduced here.
('70', 185, 11, 27, 362683) 2 Vide “Beware of Beggars”, 21 11 1936
('70', 186, 0, 1, 362722) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 187
('70', 186, 1, 2, 362770) Govind Babu first came to me sent by Deenabandhu Andrews when he was in the greatest need.
('70', 186, 1, 3, 362861) He was not wanted in Orissa.
('70', 186, 1, 4, 362890) My weakness for Orissa compelled me to keep him in Sabarmati.
('70', 186, 1, 5, 362952) His incoherent conversation did not prepossess me in his favour.
('70', 186, 1, 6, 363017) And but for his being from Orissa and his description of his sufferings I would not have harboured him in spite of Deenabandhu’s recommendation.
('70', 186, 1, 7, 363162) Like everyone else he straight way became like my sons.
('70', 186, 1, 8, 363218) Indeed his manners were so unattractive that the other inmates did not take to him kindly.
('70', 186, 1, 9, 363309) So he was my extra care.
('70', 186, 1, 10, 363334) He went to Orissa after consultation with me.
('70', 186, 1, 11, 363380) He opened the Ashram in consultation with me.
('70', 186, 1, 12, 363426) He used to send his reports regularly to me.
('70', 186, 1, 13, 363471) He did do Harijan work and khadi work under my supervision.
('70', 186, 1, 14, 363531) He collected monies in Bombay principally from those who know me and him as an inmate of Sabarmati.
('70', 186, 1, 15, 363631) I went out of my way to visit his Ashram.
('70', 186, 1, 16, 363673) On going there I was deeply pained to see the bungalow he had built there and publicly condemned it.
('70', 186, 1, 17, 363774) He pleaded guilty.
('70', 186, 1, 18, 363793) The only work worth naming that I saw being done was a well stocked dispensary which was kept in a slovenly condition.
('70', 186, 1, 19, 363912) I rebuked him severely for belying my hopes, for absence of proper accounts and any constructive work.
('70', 186, 1, 20, 364015) The dispensary was certainly not a need.
('70', 186, 1, 21, 364056) I told him it was the easiest thing for anybody to establish if he got some funds.
('70', 186, 1, 22, 364139) He had promised to mend but he did not.
('70', 186, 1, 23, 364179) Then Baba Raghavdas was sent to inquire into the working and his report was adverse.
('70', 186, 1, 24, 364264) Then came grave allegations about his morals.
('70', 186, 1, 25, 364310) These are still under investigation.
('70', 186, 1, 26, 364347) I knew nothing about his being a candidate for the Assembly.
('70', 186, 1, 27, 364408) He never consulted me about it.
('70', 186, 1, 28, 364440) He knew that I would disapprove of the step for him.
('70', 186, 1, 29, 364493) It was only after the paragraph about him had appeared that he felt compelled to disclose the secret to me.
('70', 186, 1, 30, 364601) His first letter was suppression of truth, the second an admission.
('70', 186, 1, 31, 364669) After the paragraph was published he offered to come to Segaon to clear himself.
('70', 186, 1, 32, 364750) I had a number of declarations from his erstwhile friends making most damaging statements.
('70', 186, 1, 33, 364841) I therefore accepted his offer.
('70', 186, 1, 34, 364873) But he backed out of it saying he no longer subscribed to my philosophy.
('70', 186, 1, 35, 364946) In the light of this honest outline of my connection with Govind Babu, I can only say that his letter is a gross perversion of truth.
('70', 186, 1, 36, 365080) It has been no pleasure to me to have to write a word against one in whose making I had a great deal to do and who was at one time ready to do as I would like him to.
('70', 186, 1, 37, 365247) The only relieving feature in this episode is that Govind Babu is so hysterical that he often does not know what he is speaking or that
('70', 187, 0, 1, 365383) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 188
('70', 187, 1, 2, 365425) he is speaking an untruth.
('70', 187, 1, 3, 365452) May he detect in this writing the anguish of a parent who has suddenly lost an obedient son and repent of the wound he has inflicted on me.
('70', 187, 1, 4, 365592) In spite of all his limitations I had never doubted his loyalty and readiness to carry out my wishes in the interest of the cause which bound him to me.
('70', 187, 1, 5, 365745) His two recent letters and this last have come upon me as a thunderbolt.
('70', 187, 2, 6, 365818) Harijan, 19 12 1936
('70', 187, 3, 7, 365838) 220. A CONTRAST
('70', 187, 4, 8, 365854) Thakkar Bapa sends me the following four cases from Gwalior:
('70', 187, 5, 9, 365915) (1) In the diary for October last, Sjt.
('70', 187, 5, 10, 365955) K. V. Datey, the chief Harijan worker of Gwalior State, reports that there was a great commotion amongst the audience in a public meeting held in the Town Hall at Ujjain where Jain Guru Anantsagar was speaking to an audience of about five to six hundred people, because some Harijans entered the hall to hear the religious sermon.
('70', 187, 5, 11, 366286) The orthodex section amongst the audience wanted the Harijans to go out, but the speaker and the reformists were firm, with the result that the orthodox section went away displeased.
('70', 187, 5, 12, 366469) (2) At the end of October the Suba or the Collector of Ujjain issued an order that Harijan sevaks, even of ‘high caste’, were thereafter prohibited from worshipping in the chief temple of Ujjain, because of their close contact with Harijans.
('70', 187, 5, 13, 366711) Neccessary representation has been made to the State in connection with this order.
('70', 187, 5, 14, 366795) (3) A Chamar girl in a village named Mahudia had the audacity to put a golden ring on one of her ears.
('70', 187, 5, 15, 366898) This was resented by some orthodox people who had it removed.
('70', 187, 5, 16, 366960) This came to the notice of one of the workers who went to the village and had them reconciled and the girl was allowed to put the ring on her ear.
('70', 187, 5, 17, 367107) (4) The mother of Shri Moolchand Agrawal, a khadi worker, died on 27th October at Neemuch.
('70', 187, 5, 18, 367198) Dhaniram Sagar, a Harijan and a worker, joined the funeral procession and carried the bier for a short distance out of respect for the deceased.
('70', 187, 5, 19, 367343) The orthodox amongst the funeral party resented this very much, but Sjt.
('70', 187, 5, 20, 367416) Moolchand remained firm and so the matter did not go further.
('70', 187, 5, 21, 367478) What a contrast with what is going on in Travancore!
('70', 187, 5, 22, 367531) The present Maharaja of Gwalior has only just mounted the gadi.
('70', 187, 5, 23, 367595) He made a generous statement about the Harijans.
('70', 187, 5, 24, 367644) If he follows it up by action such as Travancore’s, his Subas won’t issue the rediculous orders such

('70', 188, 1, 2, 367793) as the Suba of Ujjain is reportecd to have done, nor will caste Hindus molest Harijans as they have done according to Thakkar Bapa’s report.
('70', 188, 1, 3, 367934) The bulk of the caste Hindus are torn between two conflictiong opinions.
('70', 188, 1, 4, 368007) In the Indian States, the thing appears to be simple.
('70', 188, 1, 5, 368061) If the other Hindu princes like Travancore will issue authoritative proclamations, they will have the validity of Smritis and all opposition will be silenced.
('70', 188, 2, 6, 368220) Harijan, 19 12 1936
('70', 188, 3, 7, 368240) 221. WHAT IS A MIRACLE?
('70', 188, 4, 8, 368264) About the 9th of October last there was a meeting of Christian denominations in London.
('70', 188, 4, 9, 368352) His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury presided.
('70', 188, 4, 10, 368401) The following occurs in the report of the meeting published in the Church Times of 16th October:
('70', 188, 5, 11, 368498) The next speaker was dressed as a layman, without even the smallest discernible purple patch to indicate that he was Dr. J. W. Pickett, a Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, U.S.A. For some years past, Dr. Pickett has been studying the mass movements on the spot in India, and has published the results of his observations in Christian Mass Movements in India, described by the Archbishop of Canterbury as a remarkable and valuable book.
('70', 188, 5, 12, 368942) Dr. Pickett is profoundly impressed with the spiritual significance of the movement.
('70', 188, 5, 13, 369027) He said that four and a half millions of the depressed classes in India have become the disciples of our Lord, and the witness they bear to Him in their lives is making the multitudes in India marvel.
('70', 188, 5, 14, 369228) Even Brahmins have testified—albeit reluctantly—to the power of Christianity to transform the characters and lives of people whom they once thought incapable of religious feelings, and to whom they denied the right of entrance to the temples of Hinduism.
('70', 188, 5, 15, 369483) It is people of this kind, said Dr. Pickett, who have now standards of church attendance and worship difficult to equal in Western Christendom.
('70', 188, 5, 16, 369627) He quoted an example in the Telugu area, where 900,000 people now profess the Christian faith.
('70', 188, 5, 17, 369722) Out of 1,026 villages, 1,002 hold a service for the worship of God every evening of the year, and more than two hundred also a daily morning service.
('70', 188, 5, 18, 369872) It appeared to satisfy Dr. Pickett entirely as a test of the reality of the faith of the converts to hear a surprisingly high proportion of them speak of a sense of mystical union with God and their belief that God had come into their lives.
('70', 188, 5, 19, 370114) Even their Hindu neighbours admitted that the religion of Jesus Christ had lifted them to a new standard of cleanliness of person and home, and made them a trustworthy people.
('70', 188, 5, 20, 370290) More impressive still is the fact that high cast people are now coming into the church, literally by dozens and
('70', 189, 0, 1, 370402) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 190
('70', 189, 1, 2, 370444) hundreds, in areas where this transformation of life has occurred among the untouchables.
('70', 189, 1, 3, 370534) “It is a miracle,” he declared, “one of the great miracles of Christian history.” I have rarely seen so much exaggeration in so little space.
('70', 189, 1, 4, 370676) A reader ignorant of conditions in India would conclude that the figures relate to the conversions due to the movement led by Dr. Ambedkar.
('70', 189, 1, 5, 370816) I am sure Dr. Pickett could not have made any such claim.
('70', 189, 1, 6, 370874) He has in mind the figures to date commencing from the establishment of the first church in India hundreds of years ago.
('70', 189, 1, 7, 370995) But the figures are irrelevant to the general claim said to have been advanced by the Bishop.
('70', 189, 1, 8, 371089) Where are “the multitudes in India who marvel” at the transformation in the lives of “four and a half millions of the depressed classes”?
('70', 189, 1, 9, 371227) I am one of the mul titudes having practically travelled more than half a dozen times all over India, and have not seen any transformation on the scale described by Dr. Pickett, and certainly none of recent date.
('70', 189, 1, 10, 371440) I have had the privilege of addressing meetings of Indian Christians who have appeared to me to be no better than their fellows.
('70', 189, 1, 11, 371569) Indeed the taint of untouchability persists in spite of the nominal change of faith so far as the social status is con cerned.
('70', 189, 1, 12, 371696) Needless to say I am referring to the masses, not individuals.
('70', 189, 1, 13, 371759) I should like to know the Brahmins “who have testified—albeit reluctantly—to the power of Christianity to transform the characters and lives of people whom they once thought incapable of religious feeling.” But if it is of any consequence, I can show many Brahmins who can testify to the power of the reform movement to make a radical change in the lives and outlook of Harijans who were neglected by caste Hindus.
('70', 189, 1, 14, 372174) I must pass by the other unbelievable generalizations.
('70', 189, 1, 15, 372229) But I should like to know the hundreds of high caste Hindus who “are now coming into the church in areas where this transformation of life has occurred among the untouchables.” If all the astounding statements Dr. Pickett has propounded can be substantiated, truly it is “one of the great miracles of Christian history”, nay, of the history of man.
('70', 189, 1, 16, 372578) But do miracles need an oratorical demonstration?
('70', 189, 1, 17, 372628) Should we in India miss such a grand miracle?
('70', 189, 1, 18, 372674) Should we remain untouched by it?
('70', 189, 1, 19, 372708) Miracles are their own demonstration.
('70', 189, 1, 20, 372746) As witness the miracle in Travancore.
('70', 189, 1, 21, 372784) Nobody believed a month ago that the more than 2,000 temples of Travancore could be opened to Harijans and that Harijans would enter them in their hundreds without let or hindrance from the most orthodox Hindus.
('70', 189, 1, 22, 372996) Yet that event has happened in Travancore
('70', 190, 0, 1, 373038) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 191
('70', 190, 1, 2, 373086) which even he who runs may see.
('70', 190, 1, 3, 373118) It is beside the point whether it can be called a miracle or not.
('70', 190, 1, 4, 373184) I see in it the visible finger of the Invisible God.
('70', 190, 2, 5, 373237) I believe in the Bible as I believe in the Gita.
('70', 190, 2, 6, 373286) I regard all the
('70', 190, 3, 7, 373303) great faiths of the world as equally true with my own.
('70', 190, 3, 8, 373358) It hurts me to see any one of them caricatured as they are today by their own followers and as has been done by the learned Bishop, assuming of course that the report reproduced above is substantially correct.

('70', 190, 5, 10, 373588) 222. WHAT IS NON VIOLENCE?
('70', 190, 6, 11, 373615) A friend
('70', 190, 7, 12, 373624) 1 writes.
('70', 190, 8, 13, 373634) You enjoin on all your disciples to be non violent not only in acts but
('70', 190, 9, 14, 373706) also in words and thoughts.
('70', 190, 9, 15, 373734) In the Harijan of Nov.
('70', 190, 9, 16, 373757) 262, you are reported to have said to Mr. Andrews on his wanting to know from you your reaction to the present attitude of the missionaries, “Their behaviour has been as bad as that of the rest who are in the field to add to their numbers.
('70', 190, 9, 17, 373997) What pains one is their frantic attempt to exploit the weakness of Harijans.
('70', 190, 9, 18, 374074) If they said, ‘Hinduism is a diabolical religion and you come to us,’ I should understand.
('70', 190, 9, 19, 374165) But they dangle earthly paradises in front of them and make promises to them which they can never keep.”3
('70', 190, 10, 20, 374271) If you are reported correctly, I ask—is this not violence in words against
('70', 190, 11, 21, 374346) the missionaries as a class?
('70', 190, 12, 22, 374375) I have no disciples, being myself an aspirant after discipleship
('70', 190, 13, 23, 374440) and in search of a guru.
('70', 190, 13, 24, 374465) But that is irrelevant to the issue raised by my friend.
('70', 190, 13, 25, 374522) To say or write a distasteful word is surely not violence, especially when the speaker or writer believes it to be true as I did when I spoke to Deenabandhu as reported in the quotation.
('70', 190, 13, 26, 374709) But even if it were found that what I said was an exaggeration, or worse still, an untruth, it would not be violent in the sense used by my correspondent.
('70', 190, 13, 27, 374864) The essence of violence is that there must be a violent intention behind a thought, word, or act, i.e., an intention to do harm to the opponent so called.
('70', 190, 13, 28, 375019) Here there was and could be no such

('70', 191, 0, 1, 375182) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 192
('70', 191, 1, 2, 375224) intention.
('70', 191, 1, 3, 375235) I was engaged in a friendly conversation with two good Christians, both missionaries in their own way.
('70', 191, 1, 4, 375338) I have used much stronger language about sanatanist behaviour towards Harijans and quite latterly about the acts of dear co workers.
('70', 191, 1, 5, 375471) But there has been no violent intention behind the use of my language.
('70', 191, 1, 6, 375542) And generally I have been acquitted by my critics of any violent intention.
('70', 191, 1, 7, 375618) Indeed the acid test of non violence is that one thinks, speaks and acts non violently, even when there is the gravest provocation to be violent.
('70', 191, 1, 8, 375764) There is no merit in being non violent to the good and the gentle.
('70', 191, 1, 9, 375831) Non violence is the mightiest force in the world capable of resisting the greatest imaginable temptation.
('70', 191, 1, 10, 375937) Jesus knew ‘the generation of vipers’, minced no words in describing them, but pleaded for mercy for them before the Judgment Throne, ‘for they knew not what they were doing.’ I gave the company chapter and verse in support of the statements I made.
('70', 191, 1, 11, 376187) I regard myself as a friend of the missionaries.
('70', 191, 1, 12, 376236) I enjoy happy relations with many of them.
('70', 191, 1, 13, 376279) But my friendships have never been blind to the limitations of my friends or the systems or methods they have supported.
('70', 191, 1, 14, 376400) False notions of propriety or fear of wounding susceptibilities often deter people from saying what they mean and ultimately land them on the shores of hypocrisy.
('70', 191, 1, 15, 376563) But if non violence of thought is to be evolved in individuals or societies or nations, truth has to be told, however harsh or unpopular it may appear to be for the moment.
('70', 191, 1, 16, 376736) And mere non violent action without the thought behind it is of little value.
('70', 191, 1, 17, 376814) It can never be infectious.
('70', 191, 1, 18, 376842) It is almost like a whited sepulchre.
('70', 191, 1, 19, 376880) Thought is the power and the life behind it.
('70', 191, 1, 20, 376925) We hardly know that thought is infinitely greater than action or words.
('70', 191, 1, 21, 376997) When there is correspondence between thought, word and deed, either is a limitation of the first.
('70', 191, 1, 22, 377095) And the third is a limitation of the sceond.
('70', 191, 1, 23, 377140) Needless to say that here I am referring to the living thought which awaits translation into speech and action.
('70', 191, 1, 24, 377252) Thoughts without potency are airy nothings and end in smoke.

('70', 192, 2, 3, 377423) A correspondent who saw my article 2 on obscene advertisements writes:
('70', 192, 3, 4, 377494) You can do much in preventing obscene advertisements by exposing the names of the papers and magazines which advertise such shameless things as you have mentioned.
('70', 192, 3, 5, 377658) I can’t undertake the censorship my correspondent advises, but I can suggest a better way.
('70', 192, 3, 6, 377749) If public conscience is alive, subscribers can write to their respective papers, if they contain objectionable advertisements, drawing their attention to them and stopping their subscriptions if the offence is not cured.
('70', 192, 3, 7, 377970) The reader will be glad to know that the sister who complained to me about the obscene advertisement wrote also to the editor of the offending magazine who expressed his regret for the inadvertent admission of the obnoxious advertisement and promised to remove it forthwith.
('70', 192, 3, 8, 378245) I am glad also to be able to say that my caution has found support from some other papers.
('70', 192, 3, 9, 378336) Thus the editor of Nispruha of Nagpur writes:
('70', 192, 4, 10, 378382) I have not only read with great care your article in the Harijan regarding obscene advertisements but have given a detailed translation of it in the Nispruha.
('70', 192, 4, 11, 378541) I have also added a short editorial comment thereon.
('70', 192, 5, 12, 378594) I am enclosing a typical advertisement which though not obscene is yet immoral in a sense.
('70', 192, 5, 13, 378685) The advertisement is obviously bogus and it is generally the villager who falls a prey to it.
('70', 192, 5, 14, 378779) I have always refused such advertisements and I am also writing to this party similarly.
('70', 192, 5, 15, 378868) If an editor must supervise the reading matter that he will allow, it is as much his duty to supervise the advertisements, and no editor can permit his paper to be used by people desirous of duping the simple villagers.

('70', 193, 5, 11, 379662) KISHORELAL, As per the instructions I gave you yesterday: (1) Send to Bhai Chhaganlal Joshi Rs. 1,000 received from Manilal Kothari for khadi work, to be used for the Harijan Sevak Sangh in Kathiawar.
('70', 193, 5, 12, 379863) (2) I have sanctioned a budget of nearly Rs. 19,000 for the Nalwadi tannery for the coming year.
('70', 193, 5, 13, 379960) It is estimated that it will involve investment of nearly Rs. 9,000. Give that amount to Valunjkar as and when he needs it from the Gandhi account.
('70', 193, 5, 14, 380108) From this amount, pay back Mahadev Desai Rs. 500 taken from him.
('70', 193, 5, 15, 380173) Besides that, I have approved a 1,200 rupee plan for a building for a students’ hostel.
('70', 193, 5, 16, 380261) And then we shall also need a store room, etc., to keep the stocks of goods.
('70', 193, 5, 17, 380338) We will need to spend the necessary amounts for these constructions.
('70', 193, 5, 18, 380407) Discuss with Ramanlalji and decide from what source the amounts should be drawn.
('70', 193, 5, 19, 380488) But in the mean time spend the money from the Gandhi account.
('70', 193, 5, 20, 380550) (3) Credit Rs. 1,264 4 3 to the account of Satyagraha Ashram, Sabarmati, from the amount of the Goseva Sangh.
('70', 193, 5, 21, 380660) And Bhai Narahari has suggested that Rs. 500 (five hundred) should be sent to him.
('70', 193, 5, 22, 380743) Do accordingly.
('70', 193, 5, 23, 380759) (4) Sanction the budget for Kager from that fund to the extent it may seem necessary to you.
('70', 193, 5, 24, 380852) In this connection, have the difference between the Kamrej and Mangarol talukas clarified.

('70', 194, 3, 7, 381308) 226. WHAT SHOULD THOSE FAILING IN DUTY DO?
('70', 194, 4, 8, 381351) Some friends have posed the question arising out of the sad incident which I have had to relate: 2 “You bring to light such cases, and suggest to the persons concerned to give up their posts.
('70', 194, 4, 9, 381543) You have been unable to find fault with their work from the material point of view.
('70', 194, 4, 10, 381627) You have even praised their work.
('70', 194, 4, 11, 381661) Have they now lost their ability as well?
('70', 194, 4, 12, 381703) Should the public be deprived of their services?
('70', 194, 4, 13, 381752) Who is to fill the vacancies caused by their going?” This question is worth considering.
('70', 194, 4, 14, 381841) For myself I answered it years ago and on innumerable occasions I have acted accordingly.
('70', 194, 4, 15, 381931) I have not used the adjective ‘innumerable’ thoughtlessly.
('70', 194, 4, 16, 381990) I have acted on my belief so many times that I have lost count of them.
('70', 194, 4, 17, 382062) I believe and I have repeatedly found in experience that however able a person may be, his secret immorality cannot but leave a stamp upon his work.
('70', 194, 4, 18, 382211) This rule does have a limitation on its field of application, namely, that the type of work in question requires moral integrity.
('70', 194, 4, 19, 382341) The work done by those who lack ability but are faultless in character, has shone out.
('70', 194, 4, 20, 382428) There should be no need to give instances of this.
('70', 194, 4, 21, 382479) Doing so is a delicate task.
('70', 194, 4, 22, 382508) But if one looks at the activities which have been founded on morality, one cannot fail to be convinced by what I have said.
('70', 194, 4, 23, 382633) There should be no hesitation in believing that the removal of untouchability is impossible with the help of men who lack character.
('70', 194, 4, 24, 382766) How can even the best orator, well versed in the Shastras, change the beliefs of an orthodox sanatanist Hindu?
('70', 194, 4, 25, 382877) Attacking the intellect is futile.
('70', 194, 4, 26, 382912) The influence of such persons as Chaitanya, Ramakrishna, Rammohan Roy, Dayanand and others, still persists today.
('70', 194, 4, 27, 383026) Is this through any force?
('70', 194, 4, 28, 383053) We may perhaps come across numerous persons

('70', 195, 1, 2, 383204) more intelligent than they.
('70', 195, 1, 3, 383232) But they will not be able to convert people’s hearts.
('70', 195, 1, 4, 383286) The history of the world is replete with such instances.
('70', 195, 1, 5, 383343) Despite this, if we ask for proofs we will be justifying the saying that a bad dancer finds the courtyard uneven.
('70', 195, 1, 6, 383457) However, it must be admitted that even a person of character must have industry, a keen desire for the necessary knowledge and discernment.
('70', 195, 1, 7, 383597) However, the question asked by the correspondent still remains unanswered.
('70', 195, 1, 8, 383672) Those who have left public institutions do not and cannot give up service even if they want to.
('70', 195, 1, 9, 383768) No one can take a person away from his dharma.
('70', 195, 1, 10, 383815) Dharma belongs to him who practises it.
('70', 195, 1, 11, 383855) Dharma is for those who are engaged in the service of Harijans, in khadi work, in serving the villages.
('70', 195, 1, 12, 383959) If those who had fallen, but have come out of their swoon, will render service wherever they happen to be, who can prevent them from living in a village?
('70', 195, 1, 13, 384113) Who can prevent them from silently doing scavenging in villages while living in obscurity?
('70', 195, 1, 14, 384204) What is there to prevent them from spinning and teaching others to spin or in serving Harijans?
('70', 195, 1, 15, 384300) While doing all this, they would purify themselves to such an extent that they would not find it difficult to face society.
('70', 195, 1, 16, 384424) Even if they lived unnoticed wherever they are, the aura which they would create would spread far and wide.
('70', 195, 1, 17, 384532) I have never said or believed that there is no redemption from sin.
('70', 195, 1, 18, 384600) Even the first among the fallen can become a saint.
('70', 195, 1, 19, 384652) A historian has said this of Tulsidas.
('70', 195, 1, 20, 384691) The Gita proclaims that even for the very sinful the path of devotion leads to liberation.
('70', 195, 1, 21, 384782) It is for this reason that one of the names of God is Patitapavan.

('70', 195, 4, 24, 384891) 227. THE IDEAL AND THE ACTUAL
('70', 195, 5, 25, 384921) A gentleman has written a long letter on reading my article 2 on the ideal Bhangi.
('70', 195, 5, 26, 385004) The substance 3 of it is as follows:
('70', 195, 6, 27, 385041) 1 Purifier of the fallen 2 Vide “The Ideal Bhangi”, 28 11 1936 3 Not reproduced here.
('70', 195, 6, 28, 385127) The correspondent had written to say that he disagreed with Gandhiji’s views on the ideal Bhangi.
('70', 195, 6, 29, 385225) He felt that Gandhiji could not differentiate between the ideal and the actual and he would not be sucessful in turning anyone into an ideal Bhangi.
('70', 196, 0, 1, 385374) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 197
('70', 196, 1, 2, 385422) The correspondent has embellished his letter with many arguments.
('70', 196, 1, 3, 385488) There is nothing new in them.
('70', 196, 1, 4, 385518) The letter merely attempts to convince me.
('70', 196, 1, 5, 385561) Hence I shall not involve the reader in these arguments.
('70', 196, 1, 6, 385618) I intend to make some observations in reply in order to make my stand clearer.
('70', 196, 1, 7, 385697) An ideal which cannot be put into practice at all is not worth the name.
('70', 196, 1, 8, 385770) There will always be a gulf between the ideal and the actual.
('70', 196, 1, 9, 385832) Man’s supreme effort should be directed towards bridging this gulf.
('70', 196, 1, 10, 385900) Even today, we come across many Bhangis who are highly educated and who are carrying on their occupation and are striving to come up to my description of an ideal Bhangi.
('70', 196, 1, 11, 386071) Their number is constantly increasing.
('70', 196, 1, 12, 386110) If some of the carpenters remain carpenters all their lives, some of the farmers remain farmers, some stone cutters and some barbers continue to follow their vocations, then why can’t some of the Bhangis remain Bhangis?
('70', 196, 1, 13, 386330) Do not all these persons have a right to knowledge?
('70', 196, 1, 14, 386382) Actually every doctor and every nurse is a Bhangi.
('70', 196, 1, 15, 386433) He or she has to handle human excreta, smell, clean and analyse it.
('70', 196, 1, 16, 386501) Will it be humiliating to them if we regard them as Bhangis?
('70', 196, 1, 17, 386562) Why should that be so?
('70', 196, 1, 18, 386585) What sin has the Bhangi committed that his occupation is regarded as the lowliest of all?
('70', 196, 1, 19, 386675) This is not the case everywhere in the world.
('70', 196, 1, 20, 386721) Even in England some persons have to sweep the streets and carry away garbage.
('70', 196, 1, 21, 386800) That occupation is not regarded as demeaning by anyone there.
('70', 196, 1, 22, 386862) Any vocation scientifically pursued is as interesting as any scientific pursuit.
('70', 196, 1, 23, 386943) It is in our country that society has not allowed the vocations to grow into sciences by looking down upon them.
('70', 196, 1, 24, 387056) Hence, the carpenter does not compile technical documents on carpentry.
('70', 196, 1, 25, 387128) We import these from the West.
('70', 196, 1, 26, 387159) At present Dr. Fowler is doing the work of a Bhangi in Bangalore.
('70', 196, 1, 27, 387225) He collects all the garbage in the hotel where he stays and is minutely studying how to convert it into manure in the simplest way.
('70', 196, 1, 28, 387357) In the West the disposal of the garbage in the big cities is demanding work.
('70', 196, 1, 29, 387434) Those who do it and devise new methods for doing it are also Bhangis, aren’t they?
('70', 196, 1, 30, 387517) In Darjeeling and Simla, enormous sums are spent on the disposal of garbage.
('70', 196, 1, 31, 387594) Is it not a matter of shame and sorrow that none among our Bhangi brothers have acquired any knowledge of this?
('70', 196, 1, 32, 387706) This is a heinous sin on the part of those who are said to belong to the higher castes.
('70', 196, 1, 33, 387794) Our looking down upon Bhangis, has made them the
('70', 197, 0, 1, 387843) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 198
('70', 197, 1, 2, 387885) object of the disdain of the world.
('70', 197, 1, 3, 387921) I have not the slightest doubt in my mind that there cannot be any happiness or independence, whether economic, social or political, in the country as long the Bhangis do not get the same respect as the Brahmins.
('70', 197, 1, 4, 388134) What I have said here is not about ideals—but purely about what is practicable.
('70', 197, 1, 5, 388214) I ask for respect for the Bhangi as he is today.
('70', 197, 1, 6, 388263) When a Bhangi gains knowledge of the Brahman, we shall perforce worship him.
('70', 197, 1, 7, 388340) But we shall become purified only when we recognize a Bhangi as our own brother even as he is.

('70', 197, 5, 11, 388522) A. SALAAM,
('70', 197, 6, 12, 388533) You have indeed started writing a good deal in Hindi.
('70', 197, 6, 13, 388587) What is the use of sending a telegram to you?
('70', 197, 6, 14, 388633) There is no limit to your foolishness.
('70', 197, 6, 15, 388672) If you are not patient with the treatment, then please come to Segaon.
('70', 197, 6, 16, 388743) I will give you the treatment I desire.
('70', 197, 6, 17, 388783) I will reach Segaon on the 29th, or, at the latest, on the 31st.

('70', 197, 10, 21, 388946) FAIZPUR, December 20, 1936
('70', 197, 11, 22, 388973) BHAI KASTURBHAI,
('70', 197, 12, 23, 388990) As per our talk I have carefully examined the papers which are to be submitted to the Umpire.
('70', 197, 12, 24, 389084) I have removed all the papers connected with the three issues.
('70', 197, 12, 25, 389147) I am sending herewith the list of the papers which will have to be sent to the Umpire.
('70', 197, 12, 26, 389234) I have also appended to Nos.
('70', 197, 12, 27, 389263) 2, 7, 8, 9, 14, 15 and 16 the latest replies from the Mill owners’ Association.
('70', 197, 12, 28, 389343) The documents Nos.
('70', 197, 12, 29, 389362) 10, 11 and 12 are independent notes submitted by the Labout Association.
('70', 197, 12, 30, 389435) So far we
('70', 198, 0, 1, 389445) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 199
('70', 198, 1, 2, 389493) have not received any reply from the Association.
('70', 198, 1, 3, 389543) Those notes relate to the discussion held at Wardha.
('70', 198, 1, 4, 389596) You will see that one of them is a corrigendum.
('70', 198, 1, 5, 389644) As in the case of the other notes, the copy of this note has also been sent to the Association; so it has to be retained.
('70', 198, 1, 6, 389766) However, I will not have any objection if you feel that all these three notes should be removed.
('70', 198, 1, 7, 389863) As far as I am concerned, I have not gone into the merits and demerits of the case.
('70', 198, 1, 8, 389947) So I do not require to note mistakes or the figures mentioned in the notes in order to arrive at a decision.
('70', 198, 1, 9, 390056) I have all the papers mentioned in the list ready in case we are fated to go to the Umpire.
('70', 198, 1, 10, 390148) I have not made any notes, etc., on them, so that those can be sent to the Umpire.
('70', 198, 1, 11, 390231) However, I do hope that you, independently or with the help of some lawyer friend, have been convinced of the three basic issues I have raised and will be taking effective steps in the direction we had thought of while arranging the papers.
('70', 198, 1, 12, 390472) Naturally I had to read the papers again but I could do that only very casually.
('70', 198, 1, 13, 390553) I feel that my decision is as clear as daylight.
('70', 198, 1, 14, 390602) But that has no meaning.
('70', 198, 1, 15, 390627) However, if, and only if, you reach the same conclusion, we can save ourselves from going to the Umpire.

('70', 201, 14, 21, 394156) December 21, 1936
('70', 201, 15, 22, 394174) Mahatma Gandhi broke his silence tonight with an exhortation to the Congress volunteers, particularly those in charge of conservancy.
('70', 201, 15, 23, 394308) About 500 men and women listened to him in cloistral silence.
('70', 201, 15, 24, 394370) Speaking in quiet persuasive tones, Gandhiji dwelt at length on what he described as the science of Bhangis’ work.
('70', 201, 15, 25, 394485) He started by pointing out that he had begun his work as a Bhangi long ago in South Africa.
('70', 201, 15, 26, 394577) To be born as a ‘Bhangi’ was the result of great punya in previous birth.
('70', 201, 15, 27, 394651) He did not know what qualifications determined the birth of one man as Bhangi and another as Brahmin, but from the

('70', 202, 1, 2, 394891) point of view of benefit to society the one was no whit lower than the other.
('70', 202, 1, 3, 394969) Those who considered Bhangis’ work as mean did so in their ignorance.
('70', 202, 1, 4, 395039) Every mother acted as a Bhangi for her children; every doctor often acted as a Bhangi for his patients.
('70', 202, 1, 5, 395143) But the doctors received fat fees, while the Bhangi who was equally working for the benefit of society got very little in comparison.
('70', 202, 1, 6, 395277) Society regarded the work of Bhangis as demeaning, while the wholesome work done by the doctors was considered ennobling.
('70', 202, 1, 7, 395399) One who could not and did not do the work of the Bhangi in the proper spirit and in a thorough fashion and with pride in it could never be expected to do any other item of national service to the country effectively.
('70', 202, 1, 8, 395616) The Congress could go on with its deliberations and win success only if sanitary work was carried out properly.
('70', 202, 1, 9, 395728) Congress deliberations might end in success, but no session of the Congress could be called a success if the sanitary work was not a success.
('70', 202, 1, 10, 395870) One could go without food for two or three days and could do so without serious trouble but no one could do without the Bhangi’s services for that length of time or even less.
('70', 202, 1, 11, 396046) The greatest cause of worry for those in charge of arrangements for Congress sessions was the anxiety to see that there was no complaint on the score of food and sanitary arrangements.
('70', 202, 1, 12, 396231) Other things need not worry them so much.
('70', 202, 2, 13, 396273) Mahatma Gandhi proceeded to refer critically to the actual work he had seen some of the volunteers do.
('70', 202, 2, 14, 396376) What struck him was that they were very slow.
('70', 202, 2, 15, 396422) He did not blame them.
('70', 202, 2, 16, 396445) It was not their fault.
('70', 202, 2, 17, 396469) They were sincere, but there seemed to be none to attend to their training.
('70', 202, 2, 18, 396545) With training he was confident that they would do splendidly.
('70', 202, 2, 19, 396607) Hisconception of Ramarajya, which he said, was certain to come to India, was a dispensation under which there would be no distinction between a Brahmin and a Bhangi or even a Brahmin and a Maharaja.
('70', 202, 2, 20, 396806) They would be treated from the point of view of the usefulness to society of their respective work.
('70', 202, 2, 21, 396906) Re emphasizing the importance of Bhangi in the scheme of things, Gandhiji declared that swaraj would come to India not through the Congress parliamentarians in the legislatures, but through efficient and conscientious discharge of their work by Bhangis and other workers without looking for reward or praise in municipal and public addresses.
('70', 202, 2, 22, 397249) He exhorted the workers as well as the delegates and visitors to Faizpur to make it an ideal village.
('70', 202, 3, 23, 397351) Passing on to the number of volunteers placed at his disposal, Gandhiji said that fifteen volunteers who accompained him during his walks seemed to be too many.
('70', 202, 3, 24, 397512) He would be satisfied if one volunteer came with him just to show him the way.
('70', 202, 3, 25, 397591) Faizpur was a village, not a big city and there was no fear of big crowds requiring the attention of a large posse of volunteers.

('70', 203, 12, 12, 398092) Your letter.
('70', 203, 12, 13, 398105) Ba I expect on 24th.
('70', 203, 12, 14, 398126) It is well I did not bring her with me.
('70', 203, 13, 15, 398166) fewer there are here to look after the better.
('70', 203, 13, 16, 398213) If I could have, I [would] have prevented Ba from coming.
('70', 203, 13, 17, 398271) But that was not possible.
('70', 203, 13, 18, 398298) I do not mind how much work you do so long as you do not

('70', 203, 22, 25, 398548) December 22, 1936
('70', 203, 23, 26, 398566) Gandhiji said how happy he was to come to the village.
('70', 203, 23, 27, 398621) He regarded it as a
('70', 203, 24, 28, 398641) pilgrimage, remembering as he did the s acrifices and services of Dhanaji Nana Choudhary of the village who resigned a job in the Police department and took an important part in Congress work.
('70', 203, 24, 29, 398834) He also recalled the work of 75 men and women who kept company with Mr. Choudhary in his achievements.
('70', 203, 25, 30, 398937) 1 The report carrying the item bears the date December 22. 2 Gandhiji was presented with a purse of Rs. 100 and an address in Marathi.
('70', 203, 26, 31, 399072) Gandhiji spoke in Hindi.
('70', 203, 26, 32, 399097) Reports of the speech also apeared in The Hindu, The Hindustan Times and The Hitavada.
('70', 204, 0, 1, 399184) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 205
('70', 204, 1, 2, 399232) He had come, said Gandhiji, to congratulate the village on that record of service and he was glad to see how clean the surroundings had been kept.
('70', 204, 1, 3, 399379) If the Congress session had come nearer to them, the reason was perhaps their part in the struggle.
('70', 204, 1, 4, 399479) While I am glad to see the way in which you have kept your village clean, I am sorry to say that differentiation of man from man is bad.
('70', 204, 1, 5, 399616) The other motto says real Hinduism does not recognize discrimination between Harijans and caste Hindus.
('70', 204, 1, 6, 399720) But during my walk round the village and round the Harijan quarter I found they are differentiating between Harijans and caste Hindus.
('70', 204, 1, 7, 399855) You are not treating Harijans in the same way as you declare in your motto.
('70', 204, 1, 8, 399931) You do not allow them to have water from your wells and they are driven to have recourse to tank water which I understand is occasionally also drunk by cattle.
('70', 204, 1, 9, 400091) This is bad.
('70', 204, 1, 10, 400104) Our country has been under foreign domination.
('70', 204, 1, 11, 400151) We are not a free people.
('70', 204, 1, 12, 400177) Though all of us agree that swaraj is our birthright, we have not been able to win it so far.
('70', 204, 1, 13, 400271) Mere membership of Congress means nothing.
('70', 204, 1, 14, 400314) How many members of Congress are there today in the country?
('70', 204, 1, 15, 400375) At the most one crore.
('70', 204, 1, 16, 400398) Then what about the rest of the 34 crores?
('70', 204, 1, 17, 400441) I have left the Congress.
('70', 204, 1, 18, 400467) I am not even a four anna member of the Congress, as I have decided to educate the public—I remain in the 34 crores.
('70', 204, 1, 19, 400584) For example, there are only 250 out of 2,500 residents of your village as Congress members.
('70', 204, 1, 20, 400676) Nothing would be lost if you are all not members.
('70', 204, 1, 21, 400726) Not that I do not want you to become Congress members, but I feel there is no use in your merely becoming Congress members.
('70', 204, 1, 22, 400850) I am in favour of all of you becoming members of the Congress.
('70', 204, 1, 23, 400913) I have no objection even if you want to enter legislatures but in your attempt to do so you need not create differences and quarrels amongst yourselves.
('70', 204, 1, 24, 401066) I leave the work in the legislatures to those who have the desire, resources and leisure for such work.
('70', 204, 1, 25, 401170) I have said that nothing substantial could be achieved by entering the legislatures but if Congress decided to capture them and asked Congress members of the legislatures to carry the Congress flag even into the Council Chambers, it is because Congress wants to prevent undesirables capturing those seats and using them in a way detrimental to the national interests.
('70', 204, 1, 26, 401538) If real swaraj is to be achieved we must give up quarrelling amongst ourselves.
('70', 204, 1, 27, 401618) There should be perfect equality and fraternity.
('70', 204, 1, 28, 401667) All artificial differences between man and man, community and
('70', 205, 0, 1, 401729) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 206
('70', 205, 1, 2, 401771) community, class and class should be immediately obliterated.
('70', 205, 1, 3, 401833) After all we are all human beings, all children of the same God.
('70', 205, 1, 4, 401898) The moment we realize this and translate this in our daily lives swaraj will be within our grasp.

('70', 205, 4, 7, 402080) [Before December 23, 1936]
('70', 205, 5, 8, 402107) I have grown old but will give a message still, if you need one from me.
('70', 205, 5, 9, 402180) I can only say that until women establish their womanhood, the progress of India in all directions is impossible.
('70', 205, 5, 10, 402294) When woman whom we call abala 2 becomes sabala 3, all those who are helpless will become powerful.

('70', 205, 8, 14, 402484) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your pamphlet.
('70', 205, 8, 15, 402528) The argument appeared to me to be sound so far as it went.
('70', 205, 8, 16, 402587) Perhaps there is not sufficient emphasis on personal individual conduct irrespective of what society does or does not do.
('70', 205, 8, 17, 402709) Non violent action does not depend upon another’s co operation.
('70', 205, 8, 18, 402773) Violent action is ineffective without the co operation of others.
('70', 205, 8, 19, 402839) Here both the forces are conceived in terms of the ultimate good of society.
('70', 205, 9, 20, 402916) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI RONALD DUNCAN, ESQ.

('70', 206, 2, 3, 403219) TILAKNAGAR, December 23, 1936
('70', 206, 3, 4, 403249) AMRITLAL, The sun has not risen yet and my hand is numb with cold, but I am writing this as your postcard is lying before me.
('70', 206, 3, 5, 403375) Now you should have more strength than before.
('70', 206, 3, 6, 403422) There is a competition between you and Mira.
('70', 206, 3, 7, 403467) She has no doubt regained her strength.
('70', 206, 3, 8, 403507) She takes four pounds of milk daily and also eight to ten tolas of butter and fifteen tolas of flour, vegetable and fruit.
('70', 206, 3, 9, 403630) However, she has not put on weight; it is the same as before.
('70', 206, 3, 10, 403692) Now she washes her own clothes.
('70', 206, 3, 11, 403724) Ba, Manu and Kanu arrived here yesterday on their way to Segaon.

('70', 206, 7, 16, 403987) December 23, 1936
('70', 206, 8, 17, 404005) NARMADA,
('70', 206, 9, 18, 404014) I am writing to you since you have asked me to.
('70', 206, 9, 19, 404062) Those who think you are mature or capable of taking decisions are mistaken.
('70', 206, 9, 20, 404138) Your intellect is raw and your mind unsteady.
('70', 206, 9, 21, 404184) Your ideals are good but you do not have the ability to put them into practice.
('70', 206, 9, 22, 404264) This is my reading of you.
('70', 206, 9, 23, 404291) The person who could have guided you on the right path himself cast evil eyes on you and you fell a prey to him.
('70', 206, 9, 24, 404404) As a result, great injustice was done to the woman for whom you had a soft corner and you abetted in the crime.
('70', 206, 9, 25, 404516) How can such an immoral relationship inspire in you a spirit of service?
('70', 206, 9, 26, 404589) Why can’t you understand this?
('70', 206, 9, 27, 404620) There is no clarification either in your letter or in Ramnarayan’s letter.
('70', 206, 9, 28, 404695) This much seems clear to me: either you should forget that you are husband and wife or you should go ahead and indulge in carnal pleasures as you wish.
('70', 206, 9, 29, 404847) I believe that it is almost impossible to practise brahmacharya while calling yourselves husband
('70', 207, 0, 1, 404944) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 208
('70', 207, 1, 2, 404986) and wife.
('70', 207, 1, 3, 404996) At least your thoughts are bound to be carnal.

('70', 207, 5, 8, 405199) December 23, 1936
('70', 207, 6, 9, 405217) BHAI RAMNARAYAN,
('70', 207, 7, 10, 405234) I received the letters of you both.
('70', 207, 7, 11, 405270) I hope you have not done anything in a fit of excitement.
('70', 207, 7, 12, 405328) When both of you have decided to practise brahmacharya, the marriage does not exist at all.
('70', 207, 7, 13, 405420) It is clear from your letter that at the root of your marriage was the desire to satisfy your passion.
('70', 207, 7, 14, 405523) The married couple who voluntarily observe brahmacharya are only brother and sister.
('70', 207, 7, 15, 405608) But you were not even fit to be husband and wife.
('70', 207, 7, 16, 405658) How can a man who had relations with a woman ever marry her?
('70', 207, 7, 17, 405719) I have nothing to say if the sanctity of marriage rites has no importance in your eyes.
('70', 207, 7, 18, 405807) In that case your relations with Ganga and Narmada should be considered innocent and such a word as immorality should disappear from the language.
('70', 207, 7, 19, 405954) I am still striving with you because you respect my opinion.
('70', 207, 7, 20, 406015) However, do not take any step as long as you are not convinced of my arguments.
('70', 207, 7, 21, 406095) Whatever you do, it is bound to be difficult.
('70', 207, 7, 22, 406141) I know that it is not easy to overcome passion.
('70', 207, 7, 23, 406189) My duty is to help you to purify your thoughts.
('70', 207, 7, 24, 406237) One should not see morality in sin.
('70', 207, 7, 25, 406273) Passion makes one see right in wrong.
('70', 207, 7, 26, 406311) Now do whatever you think is proper and stick to whatever you do.
('70', 207, 7, 27, 406377) It is easy to say this but difficult to put it into practice.

('70', 208, 3, 6, 406722) Kanti has not arrived here so far and I do not know when he will.
('70', 208, 3, 7, 406788) He has gone to Poona to see one of his friends.
('70', 208, 3, 8, 406836) Come to Segaon and have a discussion with me.
('70', 208, 3, 9, 406882) If you stay on, I will give you treatment or have it given to you.
('70', 208, 3, 10, 406949) It would be right for you to come there for the peace of your mind at least.

('70', 208, 8, 16, 407186) Mahatma Gandhi said that he could not conscientiously continue to serve any longer as the President of the League 1, as he could not do without goat’s milk.
('70', 208, 8, 17, 407343) He, however, promised to continue to take interest and guide the activities of the League in the same way as he had been doing in the case of the All India Village Industries Association.

('70', 208, 12, 22, 407696) I take it that you have obtained legal opinion on the basic issues I have raised and that it has gone against me.
('70', 208, 12, 23, 407810) If it is so, one can easily understand that there is nothing you can do in this connection.

('70', 209, 1, 4, 408217) I was not bound in any way and therefore it was my duty to hear the Labour Association.
('70', 209, 1, 5, 408305) My decision no doubt goes against them but their protest is a part of the representation they have made against us and therefore it must go to the Umpire.
('70', 209, 1, 6, 408460) I did ask for paper No.
('70', 209, 1, 7, 408484) 6 and you had no objection to it.
('70', 209, 1, 8, 408518) I have no objection to dropping Nos.
('70', 209, 1, 9, 408555) 10 and 11. Both of us had asked for No.
('70', 209, 1, 10, 408595) 12. We had certainly agreed that the mistakes should be rectified.
('70', 209, 1, 11, 408662) Therefore in my record I have kept all the papers except Nos.
('70', 209, 1, 12, 408724) 10 and 11. I can say that I have even used them for arriving at my decision.
('70', 209, 1, 13, 408801) Paper No.
('70', 209, 1, 14, 408811) 12 is of no use to me, but as your opinion is based on the merits and demerits of the case I believe it is necessary for you.
('70', 209, 1, 15, 408937) If there is difference of opinion between us even over this, let it also be decided by the Umpire.
('70', 209, 1, 16, 409036) As a lot of time has already been taken up we should not delay matters further by prolonging our correspondence.
('70', 209, 1, 17, 409149) About the Rajnagar mill, my opinion is that Chimanbhai has made a serious mistake.
('70', 209, 1, 18, 409232) I feel that my decision is correct and therefore it is wrong to change it.
('70', 209, 1, 19, 409307) Had Chimanbhai allowed us to take the decision regarding the remaining mills, I would have imposed a fine on the workers so that the account would have been squared.
('70', 209, 1, 20, 409473) We should go deeper into the question of reinstating the workers.
('70', 209, 1, 21, 409539) I shall try to send my Award with addtions and alterations by tomorrow.
('70', 209, 1, 22, 409611) Kindly arrange to send it along with yours to the Umpire there or wherever he may be.
('70', 209, 2, 23, 409697) Vandemataram from MOHANDAS [PS.] I forgot one point.
('70', 209, 2, 24, 409750) We should give copies of our Awards to both the parties.
('70', 209, 2, 25, 409807) Even if we do not do so the Press will continue to write about it.
('70', 209, 2, 26, 409874) I went through the cutting you have sent.
('70', 209, 2, 27, 409916) How can we say from which side the names were leaked out?
('70', 209, 2, 28, 409974) Are newspapermen averse to indulging in guess work?
('70', 209, 2, 29, 410026) Sometimes something is bound to come true.
('70', 209, 2, 30, 410069) Don’t you think so?

('70', 210, 1, 2, 410181) 249. SPEECH AT OPENING OF KHADI AND VILLAGE INDUSTRIES EXHIBITION 1
('70', 210, 2, 3, 410249) December 25, 1936
('70', 210, 3, 4, 410267) You must have seen from the newspapers that the responsibility for having this session of the Congress in a village is wholly mine.
('70', 210, 3, 5, 410399) They had also announced that I would go to Faizpur in the beginning of December and supervise all the arrangements about the Exhibition.
('70', 210, 3, 6, 410536) The latter half of the statement is true, and without any false modesty or exaggeration I would say that I am wholly responsible for whatever shortcomings you see here.
('70', 210, 3, 7, 410705) The idea of having the Congress and the Exhibition in a village originated with me, and I must shoulder the responsibility for whatever defects or shortcomings you will notice here.
('70', 210, 3, 8, 410887) The credit for anything good that you will see belongs to those who were in charge of the arrangements here.
('70', 210, 3, 9, 410996) It was Dastane and Dev who accepted my suggestion to have the Congress and Exhibition in a village and with the thoroughness and determination that characterize the Maharashtrians they have carried out their promise.
('70', 210, 3, 10, 411213) The Exhibition was bound to be according to my conception because it is organized by the All India Spinners’ Association of which I am the President and the All India Village Industries Association which I am guiding and directing.
('70', 210, 3, 11, 411445) I had to warn them against creating a Lucknow or Delhi in a Maharashtra village.
('70', 210, 3, 12, 411526) Why not in that case have the Congress and the Exhibition both in Poona?
('70', 210, 3, 13, 411599) But if they were to be in a village, they must be in keeping with an Indian village.
('70', 210, 3, 14, 411684) And no one could do it better than I, because, as I said to them, I had long been a villager by choice, whereas they had become villagers only recently.
('70', 210, 3, 15, 411837) Of course, I too settled in Segaon only a few months ago, and as I was actually born and bred and educated in a town, my body found it difficult to adjust itself automatically to village life.
('70', 210, 3, 16, 412030) I had, therefore, malaria there.
('70', 210, 3, 17, 412063) But, as you know, I threw it off immediately, recovered quickly and am alive and kicking.
('70', 210, 3, 18, 412153) Part of the reason of course is that I am now care free, having cast all my cares on the broad shoulders of
('70', 210, 4, 19, 412261) 1 The exhibition was opened at 8.30 a.m.
('70', 210, 4, 20, 412302) Among those present were Kasturba Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Vallabhbhai Patel, Sarojini Naidu, Rajendra Prasad, Abul Kalam Azad, Govind Ballabh Pant, J.B. Kripalani, Jamnalal Bajaj and Mahadev Desai.
('70', 210, 4, 21, 412522) Reports of the speech appeared in The Hindustan Times, The Bombay Chronicle and other newspapers.
('70', 210, 4, 22, 412620) What follows is Mahadev Desai’s resume of the speech.
('70', 211, 0, 1, 412674) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 212
('70', 211, 1, 2, 412716) Jawarharlal and the Sardar.
('70', 211, 1, 3, 412744) However, let me yield up the real secret of my health, which is that my body happens to be where I had set my heart.
('70', 211, 1, 4, 412861) Credit for the arrangements here belongs to the architect Sjt.
('70', 211, 1, 5, 412924) Mhatre and the artist Sjt.
('70', 211, 1, 6, 412951) Nandalal Bose.
('70', 211, 1, 7, 412966) When Nanda Babu responded to my invitation a couple of months ago I explained to him what I wanted, and left it to him to give concrete shape to the conception.
('70', 211, 1, 8, 413127) For he is a creative artist and I am none.
('70', 211, 1, 9, 413170) God has given me the sense of art but not the organs to give it concrete shape.
('70', 211, 1, 10, 413250) He has blessed Sjt.
('70', 211, 1, 11, 413270) Nandalal Bose with both.
('70', 211, 1, 12, 413295) I am thankful that he agreed to take upon himself the whole burden of organizing the artistic side of the Exhibition and he came and settled down here some weeks ago to see to everything himself.
('70', 211, 1, 13, 413491) The result is that the whole Tilaknagar is an exhibition in itself, and so it begins not where I am going to open it but at the main gateway which is a fine piece of village art.
('70', 211, 1, 14, 413670) Of course our thanks are due also to Sjt.
('70', 211, 1, 15, 413712) Mhatre who has spared no pains in bringing the entire plan to completion.
('70', 211, 1, 16, 413786) Please remember that Nanda Babu has depended entirely on local material and local labour to bring all the structures here into being.
('70', 211, 1, 17, 413920) Now I want you to go and see the Exhibition with, if possible, my eyes.
('70', 211, 1, 18, 413992) If you will realize that it is organized under the auspices of the A.I.S.A. and A.I.V.I.A., you will know what to expect there.
('70', 211, 1, 19, 414120) The object of the former is to make the whole of India khadi clad, a goal which we are unfortunately still far from having reached.
('70', 211, 1, 20, 414252) The object of the latter is to revive the moribund cottage industries of India.
('70', 211, 1, 21, 414332) Both khadi and the other cottage industries are vital to the economic welfare of our villages.
('70', 211, 1, 22, 414427) This Exhibition is no spectacular show, it is not intended either to dazzle the eyes of the public or to delude them.
('70', 211, 1, 23, 414545) This is a genuine village Exhibition which has been brought into being by the labour of villagers.
('70', 211, 1, 24, 414644) It is a pure educative effort.
('70', 211, 1, 25, 414675) It simply shows the villagers how to double their income if only they will use their hands and feet and the resources around them.
('70', 211, 1, 26, 414806) I would ask our President to take me to a village in U.P. and I would offer to reconstruct the village not out of Jamnalalji’s money but with the help of the hands and feet of the men and women living there, on condition that he induces the villagers to work according to instructions.
('70', 211, 1, 27, 415092) Our President will perhaps say that as soon as these poor folk begin adding to their income, a zamindar like Jamnalalji would enhance the rent and thus rob the
('70', 212, 0, 1, 415252) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 213
('70', 212, 1, 2, 415300) extra income out of their hands.
('70', 212, 1, 3, 415333) Well, we will not allow the zamindar to do anything of the kind.
('70', 212, 1, 4, 415398) There is no doubt in my mind that in a country like ours teeming with millions of unemployed, something is needed to keep their hands and feet engaged in order that they may earn an honest living.
('70', 212, 1, 5, 415595) It is for them that khadi and cottage industries are needed.
('70', 212, 1, 6, 415656) It is clear to me as daylight that they are badly needed at the present moment.
('70', 212, 1, 7, 415736) What the future has in store for them I do not know, nor do I care to know.
('70', 212, 2, 8, 415812) With this Gandhiji proceeded to describe some of the exhibits that had been placed before him—small tools from the blacksmith’s smithy which had been made overnight, articles made by Andhra workmen out of grass growing on river banks (e.g.
('70', 212, 2, 9, 416052) pouches and spectacle cases), fox’s hide cured and tanned and lined with khadi at the Wardha tannery, and so on.
('70', 212, 2, 10, 416165) These little things add substantially to the income of the poor villagers.
('70', 212, 2, 11, 416240) If you can ensure them three annas instead of the three pice that they get today, they will think they have won swaraj.
('70', 212, 2, 12, 416360) That is what khadi is trying to do for the spinners today.
('70', 212, 2, 13, 416419) In brief we have to teach them how to turn waste into wealth, and that is what the Exhibition is meant to teach them.
('70', 212, 2, 14, 416537) When I met Nanda Babu two months ago I asked him not to bring from Santiniketan costly paintings from his own school of art, lest untimely rain should ruin them.
('70', 212, 2, 15, 416699) He accepted my advice and has collected things from the neighbourhood of this place.
('70', 212, 2, 16, 416784) He launched out to the villages with the eye of an artist that is his, and picked up numerous things from the peasants’ households, things that never catch an ordinary eye as striking objects of art, but which his discerning eye picked up and arranged and thus clothed with a new meaning.
('70', 212, 2, 17, 417073) Vaikunth Mehta has apologized for the small size of the Exhibition as compared with the previous ones, but there was no occasion for apology.
('70', 212, 2, 18, 417215) It does not contain one superfluous exhibit and the crafts represented mean so much additional production.
('70', 212, 2, 19, 417322) Look, for instance, at the samples of hand made paper out of munj grass, banana bark and bamboo.
('70', 212, 2, 20, 417419) Bamboo has indeed played a prominent part in all the structures you see here, and you may be sure that after this Congress camp breaks up all the bamboo will be turned to good account.
('70', 212, 2, 21, 417604) You could not but have noticed the grand simplicity of the procession that was organized for our President, especially the beau tifully designed and decorated chariots drawn by six pairs of bullocks.
('70', 213, 0, 1, 417804) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 214
('70', 213, 1, 2, 417846) Well, all that was designed in order to prepare you for what awaited you here.
('70', 213, 1, 3, 417925) No city amenities or comforts, but everything that poor villagers could provide.
('70', 213, 1, 4, 418006) The place is thus a place of pilgrimage for us all, our Kashi and our Mecca, where we have come in order to offer our prayers for freedom and to consecrate ourselves to the nation’s service.
('70', 213, 1, 5, 418197) You have not come here to lord it over the poor peasants but to learn how to get off their backs by participating in their daily toil, by doing the scavenger’s job, by washing for yourselves, by grinding your own flour, etc.
('70', 213, 1, 6, 418422) For the first time in the history of the Congress you are being given here rice unpolished of its substance and chapatis made out of hand ground flour, plenty of fresh air and clean mother earth to rest your limbs upon.
('70', 213, 1, 7, 418642) But you will please bear with all the poor organizers’ shortcomings, for in Khan Saheb’s language we are all Khudai Khidmatgars—servants of God, come here not to take but to tender service.
('70', 213, 2, 8, 418832) Harijan, 2 1 1937
('70', 213, 3, 9, 418850) 250. HALF A DOZEN OR SIX
('70', 213, 4, 10, 418875) The following Press cutting 1 has been sent to me by Thakkar Bapa.
('70', 213, 4, 11, 418942) Whether the Harijan is nominally a Christian, Muslim or Hindu and now Sikh, he is still a Harijan.
('70', 213, 4, 12, 419041) He can’t change his spots inherited from Hinduism so called.
('70', 213, 4, 13, 419102) He may change his garb and call himself a Catholic Harijan, or a Muslim Harijan or neo Muslim or neo Sikh, his untouchability will haunt him during his lifetime.
('70', 213, 4, 14, 419264) It is one and the same thing whether you call the numeral after five half a dozen or six.
('70', 213, 4, 15, 419354) Not until untouchability is removed from Hinduism will the taint be removed from Harijans, no matter what label they adopt.
('70', 213, 4, 16, 419478) Therefore Harijans have it in their hands either to save Hinduism or to destroy it, as caste Hindus have it in theirs.
('70', 213, 4, 17, 419597) It is no doubt easier for Harijans to change labels than for caste Hindus to change their hearts, but it may be easier for Harijans to rise superior to every earthly temptation and be consciously steadfast in the faith in which they have been denied by their fellows the most elementary human rights.
('70', 213, 4, 18, 419898) It is no doubt difficult for anybody to resist the temptations to which Harijans are
('70', 213, 5, 19, 419983) 1 Not reproduced here.
('70', 213, 5, 20, 420006) It reported that during the Sunday service in St. Mary’s Cathedral at Kumbakonam caste Catholics withdrew from the service on Catholic Harijans entering in an organized body and distributing themselves among caste Catholics instead of occupying the portion intended for them.

('70', 214, 1, 2, 420330) exposed today.
('70', 214, 1, 3, 420345) It will therefore be a marvel if they prove true and cling to their ancestral faith with the determination to purify it by a conscious supreme effort.
('70', 214, 1, 4, 420496) They can do this as they could not before for they know that there is a growing body of caste Hindus who are making common cause with them and making reparation for their own past wrongs and the continuing wrongs of fellow caste Hindus.
('70', 214, 1, 5, 420733) Thus viewed, the Kumbakonam incident is as much a shame of the Roman Church as it is of Hinduism.
('70', 214, 2, 6, 420831) Harijan, 26 12 1936
('70', 214, 3, 7, 420851) 251. THE SECRET OF IT
('70', 214, 4, 8, 420873) The Deputy President of the Travancore Assembly has written a long article to disprove my statement that “the way for the great step (the Proclamation) was prepared by the gentle but persistent effort of the Travancore Branch of the Harijan Sevak Sangh”.
('70', 214, 4, 9, 421128) 1 The writer even asks the local Sangh to desist from organizing public meetings and importing outsiders like Shri C. Rajagopalachari to advertise their work.
('70', 214, 4, 10, 421287) He contrasts my utter failure to have temples opened in Ahmedabad where I must be presumed to have the greatest influence.
('70', 214, 4, 11, 421410) What I meant was clear from my language that the savarna mind was made responsive by the unremitting zeal of the local Sangh in educating and preparing it.
('70', 214, 4, 12, 421566) To my knowledge there was no other body or organization in Travancore working among the savarnas to awaken their conscience.
('70', 214, 4, 13, 421691) There was nothing in my writing to suggest that the act of the Maharaja was influenced by the activity of the Harijan Sevak Sangh.
('70', 214, 4, 14, 421822) For the rest the local workers know best what to do and how to act.
('70', 214, 4, 15, 421890) So far as my own influence is concerned I must plead guilty to the Deputy President’s charge.
('70', 214, 4, 16, 421984) Not only have I not succeeded in having temples opened in Ahmedabad but I have not succeeded in having temples opened even in Wardha after my having established myself there.
('70', 214, 4, 17, 422159) And what is still more damaging to my reputation is that I have not succeeded in having the only two caste temples in Segaon opened to the Harijans of the little village.
('70', 214, 4, 18, 422330) But this confession leaves me unrepentant.
('70', 214, 4, 19, 422373) My failure is a stepping stone to the success in which
('70', 214, 5, 20, 422428) 1 Vide “An Example for Hindu Princes and Their Advisers”, 16 11 1936
('70', 215, 0, 1, 422497) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 216
('70', 215, 1, 2, 422539) I have full faith.
('70', 215, 1, 3, 422558) But it will come in God’s own time.
('70', 215, 1, 4, 422594) “Mine is but to do and die”.
('70', 215, 1, 5, 422623) Therefore the glory of the miracle of Travancore belongs undoubtedly to the Maharaja, his good mother, and his able Diwan.
('70', 215, 1, 6, 422746) And herein is a lesson for us all who are interested in the root and branch removal of untouchability.
('70', 215, 1, 7, 422849) Rightly or wrongly the tradition in Hinduism is that a Hindu Prince has the authority, as it is his duty, to propound Smritis known to the moderns as laws or rules consistent with the fundamentals of religion for the due fulfilment by the people of their moral obligations.
('70', 215, 1, 8, 423123) When years ago I had discussions with the Pandits of Vykom they had assured me that in spite of the Smriti they had produced in support of their contention, they would obey regulations to the contrary if they were promulgated by their ruler.
('70', 215, 1, 9, 423365) This belief probably accounts for the happy phenomenon we are witnessing in Travancore where its population is whole heartedly giving full effect to the Proclamation.
('70', 215, 1, 10, 423532) If the other Hindu States will follow the example of Travancore they will also perhaps discover that their people will carry out the rules that may be issued.
('70', 215, 1, 11, 423691) Anyway, the people of the respective States might well prepare public opinion in the direction.
('70', 215, 1, 12, 423787) But they must not relax their effort for having temples opened by their repective trustees without waiting for Princely lead.
('70', 215, 1, 13, 423913) For the reformers’ argument is that no new Smriti is required for opening temples to Harijans or for removing untouchability.
('70', 215, 1, 14, 424039) Only we may not leave out any honourable avenue open to us for fulfilling our purpose.
('70', 215, 1, 15, 424126) And appealing to the Princes to take the lead is an honourable avenue and most likely to hasten success.

('70', 216, 2, 3, 424330) The Church Missionary Society of England has published a pamphlet prepared by Prebendary W.W. Cash, in which
('70', 216, 3, 4, 424439) The C.M.S. is appealing for an emergency fund of £ 25,000 to enable extra grants to be made during the next five years to those areas where this big movement is taking place, and the Society appeals to the whole Church to support it in this effort.
('70', 216, 3, 5, 424688) Not for ourselves do we ask people to give, but for the sake of the hundreds of thousands who are dimly groping after Christ, and who are finding spiritual life and social uplift through the Gospel.
('70', 216, 3, 6, 424887) ‘The big movement’ referred to is the movement for the conversion of Harijans.
('70', 216, 3, 7, 424966) The money is wanted for work in the Telugu area and Travancore.
('70', 216, 3, 8, 425030) The appeal ends thus:
('70', 216, 4, 9, 425052) The movement among the outcastes is spreading to the caste people, and within the last five years it is estimated that no less than 30,000 caste peple from fifty one different castes have become Christians.
('70', 216, 4, 10, 425259) This is a movement of such far reaching consequences that we dare not refuse help.
('70', 216, 4, 11, 425342) The thousands of today may become millions tomorrow.
('70', 216, 4, 12, 425395) Will you help us to go forward in a great advance that the harvest may be reaped?
('70', 216, 4, 13, 425477) Its opening sentences run as follows:
('70', 216, 5, 14, 425515) Recent news in the papers has attracted widespread attention to the untouchable of India.
('70', 216, 5, 15, 425605) We have read of great conferences of outcaste people who have decided to break away from Hinduism.
('70', 216, 5, 16, 425704) We have heard of mass movements towards Christianity and of baptisms of tens of thousands of converts in recent years.
('70', 216, 5, 17, 425823) We have followed with growing interest the development of the young churches in these rural areas, particularly in the Dornakal and Travancore Dioceses.
('70', 216, 5, 18, 425976) We are therefore compelled to examine more closely what is happening in India and to see how far we are reaping the harvest which has come.
('70', 216, 5, 19, 426116) It contains among others these three headlines:
('70', 216, 6, 20, 426164) 1. What is happening among these people?
('70', 216, 7, 21, 426205) 2. Who is Dr. Ambedkar?
('70', 216, 8, 22, 426229) 3. What does India say to Dr. Ambedkar’s advice?
('70', 216, 8, 23, 426278) I cull the following from what appears under the third headline:
('70', 216, 9, 24, 426343) There is no doubt that there have been important repercussions all over India from the conference of untouchables.
('70', 216, 9, 25, 426458) Mr. Gandhi had previously carried
('70', 217, 0, 1, 426492) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 218
('70', 217, 1, 2, 426534) on a campaign for the removal of untouchability, but he has signally failed because he clung to the Hindu system which has been the cause of the trouble.
('70', 217, 1, 3, 426688) In passing I may remark that I am utterly unconscious of “signal failure”.
('70', 217, 1, 4, 426763) I have not clung to “the Hindu system which has been the cause of the trouble”.
('70', 217, 1, 5, 426843) On the contrary I have rejected that which has been the cause of the trouble, namely, untouchability.
('70', 217, 1, 6, 426945) And I have not abandoned the campaign as suggested in the quesiton.
('70', 217, 1, 7, 427013) Under the same headline occurs also this paragraph:
('70', 217, 2, 8, 427065) In the C.M.S. area of the Dornakal Diocese there are no less than three hundred villages appealing for teachers; they represent forty thousand people definitely asking for baptism.
('70', 217, 2, 9, 427246) The Bishop reckons that probably about a million people in his diocese are moving Christward.
('70', 217, 2, 10, 427340) Though I have travelled in the Telugu area often enough I have never heard of forty thousand Harijans or any figure near it asking for baptism.
('70', 217, 2, 11, 427484) Under the same headline occurs also this precious paragraph:
('70', 217, 3, 12, 427545) In Travancore, the Ezhava community are definitely on trek.
('70', 217, 3, 13, 427605) They are a superior type of the ‘exterior’ castes.
('70', 217, 3, 14, 427656) Many of them are educated; some are landowners, others lawyers, doctors, officials and teachers; but they are excluded from the temples and suffer from the disabilities of the outcaste community.
('70', 217, 3, 15, 427852) The leaders of one section of these people numbering over 850,000 have waited on the Bishop in Travancore, because they are anxious that their entire comm unity should become Christians.
('70', 217, 3, 16, 428039) This is by no means entirely due to Dr. Ambedkar, but is another incident in a situation which is growing in magnitude from day to day.
('70', 217, 3, 17, 428175) I dare not speak for the Ezhava leaders.
('70', 217, 3, 18, 428216) The papers report them to have congratulated the Maharaja on his Proclamation.
('70', 217, 3, 19, 428295) But that may not be inconsistent with their anxiety that their entire community should become Christians.
('70', 217, 3, 20, 428401) Let them speak if they will on the contents of the quotation.
('70', 217, 3, 21, 428463) The exaggerations of Bishop Pickett, with which I had the misfortune of dealing last week, 1 are beaten perhaps by those contained in the appeal.
('70', 217, 3, 22, 428609) There is no other way to deal with the exaggerations of which the appeal is full than by living them down and by the truth working through the lives of the reformers.
('70', 217, 3, 23, 428776) The appeal deals not with the past but with contemporary events.
('70', 217, 3, 24, 428841) And if millions are waiting to bear

('70', 218, 4, 5, 429225) TILAKNAGAR, December 26, 1936 I. The Ahmedabad Mill owners’ Association has referred to arbitration the following questions: (a) The M. O.A.’s demand for a 20% cut in wages.
('70', 218, 4, 6, 429399) (b) Complaint against the New Maneckchowk Mill.
('70', 218, 4, 7, 429447) (c) Complaint against Motilal Hirabhai Mill.
('70', 218, 4, 8, 429492) (d) Complaint against Rajnagar Mills No.
('70', 218, 4, 9, 429533) 1. The reference is subject to two conditions, viz., 1. The Arbitrators should give a simultaneous award on all the questions referred to them.
('70', 218, 4, 10, 429677) 2. With reference to the mill which might have resigned from the M.O.A. whether the Arbitrators have any jurisdiction in respect of complaints against them before they enter upon merits.
('70', 218, 4, 11, 429864) Sheth Chamanlal Girdhardas Parekh was Permanent Arbitrator on behalf of the M.O.A. but he having resigned the M.O.A. has appointed Sheth Kasturbhai in his place only with reference to the questions referred to above.
('70', 218, 4, 12, 430081) The absence of Sheth Chamanlal has been felt by all.
('70', 218, 4, 13, 430134) The Arbitrators had conversations with representatives of the M.O.A. and T.L.A. on 2nd, 3rd and 4th instant at Wardha and Segaon.
('70', 218, 4, 14, 430264) At these meetings no evidence was taken or registered beyond consultations.
('70', 218, 4, 15, 430340) But at my instance and for my edification certain particulars were supplied as embodied in Appendices 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9. With reference to the admission of these Appendices as part of the record to be submitted to the Umpire, it is likely that my brother Arbitrator will object to their admission.
('70', 218, 4, 16, 430638) I had asked for the information embodied in these Appendices in Wardha and Segaon.
('70', 218, 4, 17, 430721) There was no objection raised by my brother at the time.

('70', 219, 0, 1, 430938) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 220
('70', 219, 1, 2, 430980) was asked for by us jointly and if that also is objected to, I do not mind its exclusion as it is unnecessary for my decision.
('70', 219, 1, 3, 431107) The evidence that is submitted to the Umpire is embodied in the fourteen appendices attached hereto.
('70', 219, 1, 4, 431208) V. From the evidence submitted it appears that the T.L.A. has been obliged reluctantly to agree to the restricted reference (Appendix II).
('70', 219, 1, 5, 431347) In my opinion, if all the points of dispute between the two parties had been referred to arbitration, the Arbitrators would have found it easier to give their Award because such questions are as a rule closely related to each other.
('70', 219, 1, 6, 431580) Although therefore there seems to me to be validity in the T.L.A’s protest, its letter dated November 30th (Appendix I) is a clear acceptance, however involuntary, of the restriction.
('70', 219, 1, 7, 431764) Nevertheless the T.L.A. has a perfect right to have all these questions referred to arbitration.
('70', 219, 2, 8, 431861) ON WAGE CUT
('70', 219, 3, 9, 431873) After having read the papers herewith and having given full consideration to them on the question of the M.O.A.’s demand for a wage cut, I have come to the conclusion that evidence submitted furnishes no cause for any cut.
('70', 219, 3, 10, 432096) The last Arbitration Award was given on the 17th January 1935 (Appendix IV, sub appendix 1).
('70', 219, 3, 11, 432189) In that Award the Arbitrator has thrown certain responsibilities on both the parties of which three are as follows: (a) Earnest efforts should be made to standardize the wages of piece workers as soon as possible after 1st January 1936. (b) With a view to providing for a prompt settlement of all wages questions on either side in future the parties will meet and try to evolve a scheme for automatic adjustment of wages.
('70', 219, 3, 12, 432611) (c) The mills which are desirous of adopting rationalization will prepare before 30the June 1935 a register of workers who are working and who are likely to be unemployed in the departments to which such schemes will apply.
('70', 219, 3, 13, 432835) From the evidence submitted to the Arbitrators it appears that the M.O.A. has not discharged its share of these responsibilities nor has it taken sufficient pains to do so.
('70', 219, 3, 14, 433008) In my opinion it is possible, with sufficient endeavour, to standardize wages and although it is difficult to evolve a scheme whereby the question of increasing or decreasing wages can be automatically regulated, I do not consider it
('70', 220, 0, 1, 433242) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 221
('70', 220, 1, 2, 433290) to be impossible.
('70', 220, 1, 3, 433308) It was the obvious duty of the M.O.A. to keep a registry of hands in connection with rationalazation.
('70', 220, 1, 4, 433410) In all these three matters either party could have availed itself of the assistance of the Arbitrators but it does not apper to have occurred to them to do so.
('70', 220, 1, 5, 433570) X. It is necessary to bear this in mind that the Award of 1935 was originally a voluntary agreement between the parties.
('70', 220, 1, 6, 433691) To give it the form of an Award was obviously in the natural course but in view of the fact that the Award was merely a stabilization of the voluntary agreement, it was doubly the duty of the parties to give effect to it and is so today.
('70', 220, 1, 7, 433929) In my opinion, not until the M.O.A. has made a serious attempt to carry out the terms of the last settlement and the impossibility of its being carried out has been proved is it open for the M.O.A. to ask for a wage cut.
('70', 220, 1, 8, 434150) However, the general understanding arrived at between the two parties has the same value as the Award in determining the question of wage cut.
('70', 220, 1, 9, 434293) The fact that in spite of the admission of the necessity of having a sub arbitrator appointed to adjudicate upon petty disputes arising from time to time the appointment has not been made is injurious to the harmonious relations between the parties and becomes a cause of mutual distrust and this in its turn harms the industry.
('70', 220, 1, 10, 434622) It seems improper that the workmen’s complaints may not be disposed of in time or not at all and that the question of wage cut can still be referred to arbitration.
('70', 220, 1, 11, 434787) That the permanent Arbitrators cannot investigate every complaint is self evident.
('70', 220, 1, 12, 434870) Those who seek justice have to come with clean hands.
('70', 220, 1, 13, 434924) In my opinion the M.O.A. has not performed its duty in this matter and has no right to ask for a wage cut until this duty of appointing a sub arbitrator is discharged.
('70', 220, 1, 14, 435092) Such being my opinion it is unnecessary for me to enter into the merits of the case for wage cut.
('70', 220, 1, 15, 435190) But a study of the papers submitted by the parties has left on me the impression that the period that has elapsed since the last Award was given is too short to warrant a case for wage cut.
('70', 220, 1, 16, 435380) Besides, the M.O.A.’s statement does not substantiate its claim.
('70', 220, 1, 17, 435445) At this stage I would like to restate the principles that for the good of both parties I have presented to them as a result of my close and unbroken contact with the industry for a period of 18 years in the capacity of Arbitrator.
('70', 220, 1, 18, 435676) (a) No cut should be made till the mills have ceased to make any profit and are obliged to fall back upon their capital for continuing the industry.
('70', 221, 0, 1, 435825) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 222
('70', 221, 1, 2, 435867) (b) There should be no cut till the wages have reached the level adequate for maintenance.
('70', 221, 1, 3, 435958) It is impossible to conceive a time when the workmen have begun to regard the industry as if it were their own property and they would then be prepared to help it out of a crisis by taking the barest maintenance consisting of a dry crust and working day and night.
('70', 221, 1, 4, 436223) That would be a voluntary arrangement.
('70', 221, 1, 5, 436262) Such cases are irrelevant to the present consideration.
('70', 221, 1, 6, 436318) (c) There should be a common understanding as to what should be included in determining a living wage.
('70', 221, 1, 7, 436421) (d) The consideration of the deterioration in individual mills cannot form part of a case for a cut in wages of labour in general.
('70', 221, 1, 8, 436552) (e) It is vital to the well being of the industry that workmen should be regarded as equals with the shareholders and that they have therefore every right to possess an accurate knowledge of the transactions of the mills.
('70', 221, 1, 9, 436774) (f) There should be a register of all available mill hands acceptable to both the parties and the custom of taking labour through any agency other than the T.L.A. should be stopped.
('70', 221, 1, 10, 436956) I have not presented these principles in the belief that they will be acceptable either to the brother Arbitrator or to the mill owners or even to the workmen.
('70', 221, 1, 11, 437116) These have not guided my decision in the present case but I am convinced that without the acceptance of these principles the industry, i.e., the owners and the workmen, are in danger.
('70', 221, 1, 12, 437300) Before concluding the discussion on the wage cut it seems to be necessary for me to allude to a thing that has come under my observation in the course of the proceedings.
('70', 221, 1, 13, 437471) The control of the M.O.A. over individual mills appears to have slackened.
('70', 221, 1, 14, 437546) When the M.O.A’.s decisions appear repugnant to individual mill owners, they are tempted to secede.
('70', 221, 1, 15, 437646) This is undoubtedly a regrettable state of things and requires to be mended.
('70', 221, 1, 16, 437723) But it cannot be cited in support of a case for wage cut.
('70', 221, 1, 17, 437781) The burden of maintaining such mills cannot be laid on the shoulders of labour.
('70', 221, 1, 18, 437861) The deterioration of individual mills has been found to be due to the shortcomings of managers, out of date machinery or such other internal defects.
('70', 221, 2, 19, 438011) NEW MANECKCHOWK MILL
('70', 221, 3, 20, 438032) The reduction of wages by this mill is not denied but no mill has any right to initiate a reduction of its own will.
('70', 221, 3, 21, 438149) M.O.A. says
('70', 222, 0, 1, 438161) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 223
('70', 222, 1, 2, 438209) that this mill has retired from the Association and the Arbitration has, therefore, no jurisdiction to entertain the case.
('70', 222, 1, 3, 438332) One notice of reduction was issued on 8th August last and the other on the 2nd October last.
('70', 222, 1, 4, 438425) Meanwhile the mill seceded from the Association on the 20th August last.
('70', 222, 1, 5, 438498) The M.O.A’s statement that the reduction was made on September 30th is evidently a slip of the pen.
('70', 222, 1, 6, 438598) Whether it is or not, the fact of the resignation does not debar the T.L.A. from bringing the case before Arbitration.
('70', 222, 1, 7, 438717) If, whenever a mill so acts as to have its action impeached by the Arbitrators and therefore resigns with a view to escaping discipline, the system of arbitration becomes meaningless.
('70', 222, 1, 8, 438901) How the M.O.A. can enforce discipline against a seceder is another question.
('70', 222, 1, 9, 438978) Such a question, when it arises, can be dealt with by resort to arbitration if it becomes necessary.
('70', 222, 1, 10, 439079) In my opinion the mill in question should restore the reduced amount and withdraw the notice.
('70', 222, 1, 11, 439173) If the defaulting mill does not carry out this decision the M.O.A. should co operate with the T.L.A. in adopting all legitimate measures against the defaulter.
('70', 222, 2, 12, 439333) MOTILAL HIRABHAI MILL XX.
('70', 222, 2, 13, 439359) I can give no definite opinion on the papers submitted.
('70', 222, 2, 14, 439415) If the owners of this mill do not furnish the required information the M.O.A. should procure it without delay and if it is not procured the T.L.A. is at liberty to come before the Arbitrators.
('70', 222, 2, 15, 439608) Although the M.O.A. and the mill do not appear to have given the necessary help to the T.L.A., the latter erred in assisting the workmen in resorting to the strike if such assistance was in fact given.
('70', 222, 2, 16, 439810) However provoking the circumstances might be, workmen cannot cease work without due notice nor can owners impose reduction of their own motion.
('70', 222, 2, 17, 439954) This is inherent in the acceptance of the principle of arbitration.
('70', 222, 3, 18, 440022) THE DECISION Thus on the points submitted to arbitration my decision is as follows: 1. The case for wage cut is dismissed for the reason that the M.O.A. has failed to prove it.
('70', 222, 3, 19, 440199) 2. The alleged resignation by the New Maneckchowk Mill does not put it outside the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Board.
('70', 222, 3, 20, 440321) The mill should restore the reduced wages and withdraw the cut notice.
('70', 222, 3, 21, 440392) If the owners do not carry out this decision, the M.O.A. should co operate with the T.L.A., in taking all legitimate steps to enforce discipline and should seek the assistance of the Arbitration Board, if necessary.
('70', 222, 3, 22, 440608) 3. I am unable to give a definite decision about the complaint against Motilal Hirabhai Mill

('70', 223, 3, 4, 440862) BHAI KASTURBHAI,
('70', 223, 4, 5, 440879) I am enclosing herewith my Award 1 with two extra copies, one for the Labour Association and the other for the Mill owners’ Association.
('70', 223, 4, 6, 441016) Please go through the additions and alterations made therein.
('70', 223, 4, 7, 441078) There is a reference to sub appendices in the Appendix.
('70', 223, 4, 8, 441134) As desired by you I have droped sub appendices and have made a note to that effect in the Appendix.
('70', 223, 4, 9, 441234) Please see.
('70', 223, 4, 10, 441246) After writing to you yesterday, I thought about the question at night and while writing this it has occured to me that greater justice would be done by not recommending payment of arrears of the wages and therefore I am revising the decision.
('70', 223, 4, 11, 441489) I have only made a recommendation concerning the wages, which you will see.
('70', 223, 4, 12, 441565) You will also find therein my reasons for not paying the arrears.
('70', 223, 4, 13, 441631) It is in conformity with my nature.
('70', 223, 4, 14, 441667) If you had not drawn my attention to it, I would not perhaps have noticed the error in my approach.
('70', 223, 4, 15, 441767) However, you drove me to hard thinking.
('70', 223, 4, 16, 441807) I very much wanted to accept your suggestion.
('70', 223, 4, 17, 441853) You demonstrated your friendship by drawing my attention to my error.
('70', 223, 4, 18, 441923) Should I thank you for that?
('70', 223, 4, 19, 441952) Truth will cease to exist in this world if friends do not fulfill their duty of cautioning one another.
('70', 223, 4, 20, 442056) I hope you have received the telegram I have sent to you.
('70', 223, 4, 21, 442114) It is good if you are able to act accordingly.
('70', 223, 4, 22, 442161) It hurts me that hundreds of workers are unemployed.
('70', 223, 4, 23, 442214) It also pains me that we are not allowed to hear their case.
('70', 223, 4, 24, 442275) Therefore please do not a waste a single minute.
('70', 223, 4, 25, 442324) I do not have a copy of the letter to the Umpire.
('70', 223, 4, 26, 442374) Has he been given fifteen days’ time limit?
('70', 223, 4, 27, 442418) Whatever it may be, please request the Umpire on behalf of us both that he should give the decision as early as possible even within that time limit.

('70', 224, 2, 3, 442738) December 26, 1936
('70', 224, 3, 4, 442756) MIRA, Your two letters before me.
('70', 224, 3, 5, 442790) You have to live down the hottest tempers if you are to express ahimsa in your life.
('70', 224, 3, 6, 442875) It makes no difference whether the temper is directed towards you personally or towards your wards or dear friends.
('70', 224, 3, 7, 442991) They, Balwantisinha and Munnalal, would not have been with me if they were perfect men or very nearly so.
('70', 224, 3, 8, 443097) May reach there 30th inst.
('70', 224, 4, 9, 443124) From the original: C.W. 6370. Courtesy: Mirabehn.
('70', 224, 4, 10, 443174) Also G.N. 9836.
('70', 224, 5, 11, 443190) 256. MESSAGE TO STUDENTS1
('70', 224, 6, 12, 443216) FAIZPUR, [December 26, 1936] 2
('70', 224, 7, 13, 443247) What new message can I give you at the age of 68?
('70', 224, 7, 14, 443297) And where is the use of my giving you a message if you pass a resolution there of assassinating me or burning my effigy?
('70', 224, 7, 15, 443418) Assassinating the body of course does not matter, for out of my ashes a thousand Gandhis will arise.
('70', 224, 7, 16, 443519) But what if you assassinate or burn the principles I have lived for?
('70', 224, 8, 17, 443588) Harijan, 16 1 1937
('70', 224, 9, 18, 443607) 257. HINDU CODE OF CONDUCT
('70', 224, 10, 19, 443634) I have preserved the following letter 3 for the past seven months.
('70', 224, 10, 20, 443701) I have been keeping the letter suppressed in the belief that it would be better if I got some learned scholar to reply to it instead of doing so myself.
('70', 224, 10, 21, 443854) Shri Anandshankarbhai has at my request taken the
('70', 224, 11, 22, 443904) 1 Extracted from Mahadev Desai’s “Weekly Letter”.
('70', 224, 11, 23, 443954) The message was in response to a request from the secretary of a students’ conference.
('70', 224, 11, 24, 444041) 2 Mahadev Desai says the message was given the day before Gandhiji made his “great speech on the cult of the Charkha”, which was on December 27. 3 Not translated here.
('70', 224, 11, 25, 444209) The correspondent had written to say that it was better to teach Harijans how to observe Hindu religion in day to day life than to give them lectures on culture
('70', 225, 0, 1, 444370) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 226
('70', 225, 1, 2, 444412) work in hand now.
('70', 225, 1, 3, 444430) However, the book which will result will not solve the above question in the manner desired by the correspondent.
('70', 225, 1, 4, 444544) It is my hope that he will glean the required information from the book.
('70', 225, 1, 5, 444617) I am putting forward something of that sort here; because I have spent years working amongst Harijans.
('70', 225, 1, 6, 444720) My experience, therefore, may be useful to other workers like the correspondent.
('70', 225, 1, 7, 444801) I do not talk to Harijans about the basic tenets of Hinduism.
('70', 225, 1, 8, 444863) If they had separate temples I would certainly visit them.
('70', 225, 1, 9, 444922) I would jest with the priest there.
('70', 225, 1, 10, 444958) Ordinarily, the poor man is very ignorant.
('70', 225, 1, 11, 445001) This does not mean that a caste Hindu priest knows more.
('70', 225, 1, 12, 445058) But why should the latter listen to me?
('70', 225, 1, 13, 445098) A Harijan priest would regard me as a great man and lend me an ear at least.
('70', 225, 1, 14, 445175) It is a different thing if he lets my words go out through the other ear.
('70', 225, 1, 15, 445249) I would say the following to a band of Harijans: So far, we have spurned you; we did not even look at you, we did not share your joys and sorrows.
('70', 225, 1, 16, 445396) Let me now tell you what our religion expects of us.
('70', 225, 2, 17, 445449) 1. If we are not in the habit of waking up before dawn, we should form it.
('70', 225, 2, 18, 445524) 2. There are many persons who start smoking immediately on waking up, others, little better, make the whole house aware of their having woken up by talking profanities.
('70', 225, 2, 19, 445693) Instead of doing this, one should take the name of God before leaving the bed and thank Him for the night having passed safely.
('70', 225, 2, 20, 445821) 3. On leaving the bed we should immediately awaken our children and then, sitting in a place which is not frequented by people, we should clean our teeth with babul or some other twig.
('70', 225, 2, 21, 446006) We should use either salt or powdered charcoal which we must keep ready at home to clean our teeth and with the halves of the twig we should scrape the tongue and rinse the mouth well.
('70', 225, 2, 22, 446191) We should sprinkle water over our eyes and remove mucus if there is any.
('70', 225, 2, 23, 446264) Having done that we must wash our face, nose, ears, etc., carefully and wipe these with a clean cloth.
('70', 225, 2, 24, 446367) 4. If one has to evacuate one’s bowels and that particular village has no latrine, or if there is one, but one does not like to use it, this function should be performed in a remote place which people do not frequent.
('70', 225, 2, 25, 446585) The excreta should be properly covered with earth and the organs concerned should be properly cleansed with water.
('70', 225, 2, 26, 446700) As both the excretory organs throw out waste, these should be properly cleansed and the waste material eliminated.
('70', 225, 2, 27, 446815) Thereafter the hands should be
('70', 226, 0, 1, 446846) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 227
('70', 226, 1, 2, 446894) washed with water and earth, and the water pot should also be cleaned well.
('70', 226, 1, 3, 446970) 5. While performing this daily routine one should either hum Ramdhun or some devotional song.
('70', 226, 1, 4, 447064) If one does not know any of these, one should merely keep repeating the name of Rama.
('70', 226, 1, 5, 447150) 6. It would be daylight by the time one returns home.
('70', 226, 1, 6, 447204) Other members of the family will also have performed their natural functions as mentioned above.
('70', 226, 1, 7, 447301) All should then get together and sing bhajans or kirtans for five minutes to half an hour.
('70', 226, 1, 8, 447392) So long as one does not know any such thing, one can at least repeat the name of Rama.
('70', 226, 1, 9, 447479) 7. Thereafter, everyone should set out for work after taking breakfast.
('70', 226, 1, 10, 447551) Children who do not work should go to school.
('70', 226, 1, 11, 447597) 8. Before taking the midday meal, everyone should bathe with clean water and scrub the entire body.
('70', 226, 1, 12, 447697) Dhoti, sari and such other garments should be washed.
('70', 226, 1, 13, 447751) The poor who do not have the facility of daily change should wear a loin cloth while bathing.
('70', 226, 1, 14, 447845) The body should be rubbed and wiped after a bath.
('70', 226, 1, 15, 447895) 9. In this manner, when night falls while performing one’s daily tasks, God’s name should be uttered after the evening meal and before going to bed and He should be thanked that the day passed without any mishaps.
('70', 226, 1, 16, 448109) 10. The hands should be washed after every meal and after performing any task which soils the hands.
('70', 226, 1, 17, 448210) After a meal, one should gargle and rinse one’s mouth.
('70', 226, 1, 18, 448265) 11. We should realize that God knows our every thought, sees everything we do.
('70', 226, 1, 19, 448344) Hence no one can deceive Him.
('70', 226, 1, 20, 448374) How then can we deceive out brothers and sisters who are His creatures?
('70', 226, 1, 21, 448446) It may well be that these persons are unaware of our deception.
('70', 226, 1, 22, 448510) If they come to know of the latter, how can we cheat them at all?
('70', 226, 1, 23, 448576) 12. Hence we should sincerely serve those under whom we work and not deceive them.
('70', 226, 1, 24, 448659) 13. And, if we do not deceive anyone, how can we commit any theft?
('70', 226, 1, 25, 448726) Even cheating while weighing goods amounts to theft.
('70', 226, 1, 26, 448779) 14. We certainly would not like anyone to abuse us or beat us or misbehave with our mother or sisters.
('70', 226, 1, 27, 448882) Hence we should not abuse anyone, not even our wives and children.
('70', 226, 1, 28, 448949) 15. Nor should we beat anyone.
('70', 226, 1, 29, 448980) This includes our wives and children.
('70', 226, 1, 30, 449018) These persons have to be separately mentioned because many men regard their wives and children as their property.
('70', 226, 1, 31, 449132) But it is a
('70', 227, 0, 1, 449144) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 228
('70', 227, 1, 2, 449186) grave error.
('70', 227, 1, 3, 449199) In our religion the wife has been regarded the equal of the husband.
('70', 227, 1, 4, 449268) Hence, she is known as the other half, co partner in religion, a goddess.
('70', 227, 1, 5, 449342) Children are not our property.
('70', 227, 1, 6, 449373) Parents are the protectors of children.
('70', 227, 1, 7, 449413) Hence, even with them, we should be gentle, tolerant and patient.
('70', 227, 1, 8, 449479) 16. Just as we should have goodwill towards our wives and children, similarly we should treat our elders and our parents with respect.
('70', 227, 1, 9, 449614) 17. And, as shown in 14 above, it is obvious that a man should treat another man’s wife as his sister or mother and, similarly, a woman should regard another man as her father or brother.
('70', 227, 1, 10, 449802) 18. Just as all men are creatures of God, so also animals are His creatures; hence they are also a part of the family.
('70', 227, 1, 11, 449921) We should therefore be good towards them too.
('70', 227, 1, 12, 449967) We cannot misuse even mud or stones.
('70', 227, 1, 13, 450004) Our religion teaches us even such prayer: “Oh!
('70', 227, 1, 14, 450051) Mother Earth, we walk upon you every day.
('70', 227, 1, 15, 450093) We depend upon your support.
('70', 227, 1, 16, 450122) Forgive us for touching you with our feet.” Having said this, we put a pinch of dust upon our heads.
('70', 227, 1, 17, 450223) 19. And hence we should be kind towards our animals; we should feed them properly; we should certainly not overload them with burdens, we should keep them in clean places; and refrain from beating them.
('70', 227, 1, 18, 450426) 20. Similarly, we should pluck leaves and cut trees only as much as we must.
('70', 227, 1, 19, 450503) We should use discretion while doing so.
('70', 227, 1, 20, 450544) We should not destroy wantonly.
('70', 227, 1, 21, 450576) 21. So far as possible, we should avoid eating meat.
('70', 227, 1, 22, 450629) Beef should be totally shunned.
('70', 227, 1, 23, 450661) Cow protection occupies a very prominent place in our religion.
('70', 227, 1, 24, 450725) 22. In accordance with clause 19, all living creatures are our brothers and sisters.
('70', 227, 1, 25, 450810) Hence, our rishis and munis taught us that we should regard the cow as our mother and should develop friendly relations towards all living beings including non human creatures.
('70', 227, 1, 26, 450987) It is in the fitness of things to regard the cow as our mother as she, like the mother, gives us milk.
('70', 227, 1, 27, 451090) One who gets milk does not require fish or meat.
('70', 227, 1, 28, 451139) Moreover, the cow provides us with bullocks and even after death gives us leather, manure, fat for carts, etc., and such other things.
('70', 227, 1, 29, 451274) Hence, we should never kill a cow.
('70', 227, 1, 30, 451309) 23. And if we may not kill a cow, how can we eat her flesh after her death?
('70', 227, 1, 31, 451385) No sensible people in the world eat carrion.
('70', 228, 0, 1, 451430) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 229
('70', 228, 1, 2, 451478) 24. By becoming an addict, a man renders himself virtually insane; sometimes, he completely loses his senses.
('70', 228, 1, 3, 451588) Hence liquor, toddy, bhang, ganja, opium and tobacco should be eschewed.
('70', 228, 1, 4, 451661) 25. Gambling involves deception and the money obtained through it is tainted.
('70', 228, 1, 5, 451739) Hence we should not gamble.
('70', 228, 1, 6, 451767) 26. Others are as fond of their religion as we are of ours.
('70', 228, 1, 7, 451827) Hence we should respect all religions eqully.
('70', 228, 1, 8, 451873) And, therefore we should bear no ill will or have disputes with Muslims, Christians and followers of other faiths.
('70', 228, 1, 9, 451988) 27. If religion teaches us that all are children of God, there can be no high or low among them and there should not be even the faintest trace of untouchability.
('70', 228, 1, 10, 452151) 28. Finally, our religion also tells us that anyone who does not earn his living with the sweat of his brow, eats stolen food.
('70', 228, 1, 11, 452278) Hence, everyone should earn his bread by engaging himself in such manual tasks as farming, or making cloth, etc., and it is for this very reason that each person should produce foodgrains, khadi and such other articles of food and clothing in his own village.
('70', 228, 1, 12, 452538) These things which I have often said on different occasions have been put down in written form here.
('70', 228, 1, 13, 452639) Other clauses may be added to these when the occasion arises bearing in mind the universal elements like truth and non violence, which are involved in them.
('70', 228, 1, 14, 452796) [From Gujarati] Harijanbandhu, 27 12 1936
('70', 228, 2, 15, 452838) 258. DUTY TOWARDS CHRISTIAN HARIJANS
('70', 228, 3, 16, 452875) A worker in the cause of Harijans has asked me what should be the duty of the Harijan Sevak Sangh towards Christian Harijans.
('70', 228, 3, 17, 453001) His letter contains many subsidiary questions which need not be reproduced here.
('70', 228, 3, 18, 453082) This article is intended to answer those very questions.
('70', 228, 3, 19, 453139) Ordinarily it may be said that the special duty which the Sangh has taken upon itself and attempts to fulfil towards Hindu Harijans, does not hold good in case of those who have become Christians.
('70', 228, 3, 20, 453336) However, the goodwill that one human being should have towards another should also be shown towards Christian Harijans.
('70', 228, 3, 21, 453456) This rule applies to people of all faiths.
('70', 228, 3, 22, 453499) We cannot be displeased with a Harijan because he calls himself a Christian.
('70', 228, 3, 23, 453576) However, if he is in receipt of a
('70', 229, 0, 1, 453610) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 230
('70', 229, 1, 2, 453652) scholarship or any such special assistance from the Sangh, that should be discontinued.
('70', 229, 1, 3, 453740) But if, despite having become a Christian, he is in a Harijan school and wishes to continue in it, he cannot be turned out.
('70', 229, 1, 4, 453864) Perhaps he may be asked to pay his fees.
('70', 229, 1, 5, 453905) He cannot be given the usual free clothes, etc., as the Sangh’s funds are meant for Hindu Harijans only.
('70', 229, 1, 6, 454010) Hindus, other than Harijans, can be admitted to Harijan schools, but they cannot join them withour paying fees.
('70', 229, 1, 7, 454122) The same rule should apply to those who have become Christians.
('70', 229, 1, 8, 454186) Christian Harijans should not be offered temptations to embrace Hinduism again.
('70', 229, 1, 9, 454266) However, if a person wishes to return to his own faith we should not prevent him from doing so.
('70', 229, 1, 10, 454362) But if Christian Harijans ask for facilities such as the use of wells or medical help during illness, it is our common dharma to render such service.
('70', 229, 1, 11, 454512) However, even in these instances assistance cannot be given from Harijan funds.
('70', 229, 1, 12, 454592) But facilities should be provided for these persons to draw water from wells which are used by Hindu Harijans.
('70', 229, 1, 13, 454703) Sangh workers should provide Christian Harijans also the services of a doctor or worker who renders free service to Hindu Harijans.
('70', 229, 1, 14, 454835) It is their dharma to do so.

('70', 229, 5, 18, 454963) AMTUL SALAAM,
('70', 229, 6, 19, 454977) I got your letter.
('70', 229, 6, 20, 454996) I have to go to Travancore on the 10th.
('70', 229, 6, 21, 455036) Kanti arrived the day before yesterday.
('70', 229, 6, 22, 455076) I had a three minutes’ talk with him last night.
('70', 229, 6, 23, 455125) You must reach Segaon on the 3rd.
('70', 229, 6, 24, 455159) I am in a great hurry.
('70', 229, 7, 25, 455182) Blessings from BAPU

('70', 230, 1, 2, 455293) 260. SPEECH AT EXHIBITION GROUND, FAIZPUR
('70', 230, 2, 3, 455335) December 27, 1936
('70', 230, 3, 4, 455353) This speech was scheduled for 8.30. I am sorry that it is being delivered so late at 9.15. But there was no alternative.
('70', 230, 3, 5, 455474) People have turned up here in such large numbers and as our exhibition has only screens of unseasoned bamboo for walls, if everyone makes a rush for it they would collapse.
('70', 230, 3, 6, 455647) Hence, arrangements had to be made to protect things and the organizers took some time in doing this.
('70', 230, 3, 7, 455749) They were not prepared for such an onrush.
('70', 230, 3, 8, 455792) You will feel that there has been a trick in putting my speech on the programme.
('70', 230, 3, 9, 455873) This was deliberate.
('70', 230, 3, 10, 455894) If for no other reason, people would come to hear me and give two annas for the exhibition.
('70', 230, 3, 11, 455986) While doing so if they by accident or mistake purchase some khadi and have a glimpse of rural art, they will earn some merit without any particular effort and so will I. You must have seen that the whole of Tilaknagar is like an exhibition.
('70', 230, 3, 12, 456227) The credit for this goes to Shri Nandalal Bose.
('70', 230, 3, 13, 456275) It was he who decided that the plan for both the exhibition and the Congress should be the same.
('70', 230, 3, 14, 456372) Only a paltry sum has been spent in doing so.
('70', 230, 3, 15, 456418) I do not know of any Congress session which has been organized at such a low cost.
('70', 230, 3, 16, 456501) Of course, in my opinion, some expenses have been unnecessarily incurred, but, then, is this not the first Congress to be held in a village?
('70', 230, 3, 17, 456642) A fair amount had to be spent in obtaining land.
('70', 230, 3, 18, 456691) But we have done something which will encourage us to hold the future sessions of the Congress in villages.
('70', 230, 3, 19, 456799) You can see the crowd is increasing.
('70', 230, 3, 20, 456836) There are many volunteers, but they seem to get lost in the crowd.
('70', 230, 3, 21, 456903) There are so many persons who have to be fed that it has become difficult to make arrangements for them.
('70', 230, 4, 22, 457008) I am going to say nothing new today.
('70', 230, 4, 23, 457045) The cult of the spinning wheel is 18 years old.
('70', 230, 4, 24, 457093) I said in 1918 that we could win swaraj through the spinning wheel.
('70', 230, 4, 25, 457161) My faith in the ability of the spinning wheel is as bright today as when I first declared it in 1918. It has become richer for the experience and experiment of all these years.
('70', 230, 5, 26, 457338) 1 This is taken from the Gujarati version published in Harijanbandhu.
('70', 230, 5, 27, 457408) What follows is reproduced from Mahadev Desai’s report in Harijan, “A Restatement of Faith”.
('70', 230, 5, 28, 457501) The report was revised by Gandhiji.
('70', 231, 0, 1, 457537) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 232
('70', 231, 1, 2, 457579) But you should know the implications of the wheel or khadi, its product.
('70', 231, 1, 3, 457652) It is not enough that one wears khadi on ceremonial occasions or even wears it to the exclusion of all other cloth if he surrounds himself with videshi in everything else.
('70', 231, 1, 4, 457824) Khadi means the truest swadeshi spirit, identification with the starving millions.
('70', 231, 1, 5, 457907) Let there be no mistake about my conception of swaraj.
('70', 231, 1, 6, 457962) It is complete independence of alien control and complete economic independence.
('70', 231, 1, 7, 458043) So at one end you have political independence, at the other the economic.
('70', 231, 1, 8, 458117) It has two other ends.
('70', 231, 1, 9, 458140) One of them is moral and social, the corresponding end is dharma, i.e., religion in the highest sense of the term.
('70', 231, 1, 10, 458255) It includes Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, etc., but is superior to them all.
('70', 231, 1, 11, 458333) You may recognize it by the name of Truth, not the honesty of expedience but the living Truth that pervades everything and will survive all destruction and all transformation.
('70', 231, 1, 12, 458509) Moral and social uplift may be recognized by the term we are used the term we are used to, i.e., non violence.
('70', 231, 1, 13, 458620) Let us call this the square of swaraj, which will be out of shape if any of its angles is untrue.
('70', 231, 1, 14, 458718) In the language of the Congress we cannot achieve this political and economic freedom without truth and non violence, in concrete terms without a living faith in God and hence moral and social elevation.
('70', 231, 1, 15, 458922) By political independence I do not mean an imitation of the British House of Commons, or the Soviet rule of Russia or the Fascist rule of Italy or the Nazi rule of Germony.
('70', 231, 1, 16, 459095) They have systems suited to their genius.
('70', 231, 1, 17, 459137) We must have ours suited to ours.
('70', 231, 1, 18, 459171) What that can be is more than I can tell.
('70', 231, 1, 19, 459213) I have described it as Ramarajya i.e., sovereignty of the people based on pure moral authority.
('70', 231, 1, 20, 459309) The Congress constit utions of Nagpur and Bombay for which I am mainly responsible are an attempt to achieve this type of swaraj.
('70', 231, 1, 21, 459439) Then take economic independence.
('70', 231, 1, 22, 459472) It is not a product of industrialization of the modern or the Western type.
('70', 231, 1, 23, 459548) Indian economic independence means to me the economic uplift of every individual, male and female, by his or her own conscious effort.
('70', 231, 1, 24, 459683) Under that system all men and women will have enough clothing—not the mere loin cloth, but what we understand by the term necessary articles of clothing and enough food including milk and butter which are today denied to millions.
('70', 231, 1, 25, 459914) This brings me to socialism.
('70', 231, 1, 26, 459943) Real socialism has been handed down to us by our ancestors who taught: “All land belongs to Gopal, where then is the boundary line?
('70', 231, 1, 27, 460075) Man is the maker of the line and he can therefore unmake it.” 1 Gopal literally means shephred; it also
('70', 232, 0, 1, 460179) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 233
('70', 232, 1, 2, 460227) means God.
('70', 232, 1, 3, 460238) In modern language it means the State, i.e., the people.
('70', 232, 1, 4, 460295) That the land today does not belong to the people is too true.
('70', 232, 1, 5, 460358) But the fault is not in the teaching.
('70', 232, 1, 6, 460396) It is in us who have not lived up to it.
('70', 232, 1, 7, 460437) I have no doubt that we can make as good an approach to it as is possible for any nation, not excluding Russia, and that without violence.
('70', 232, 1, 8, 460576) The most effective substitute for violent dispossession is the wheel with all its implications.
('70', 232, 1, 9, 460672) Land and all property is his who will work it.
('70', 232, 1, 10, 460719) Unfortunately the workers are or have been kept ignorant of this simple fact.
('70', 232, 1, 11, 460797) Let us now see how India came to be utterly impoverished.
('70', 232, 1, 12, 460855) History tells us that the East India Company ruined the cotton manufacture and by all kinds of means made her dependent upon upon Lancashire for her cloth, the next great necessity of man.
('70', 232, 1, 13, 461044) It is still the largest item of import.
('70', 232, 1, 14, 461084) It thus created a huge army of partially unemployed men and women counted in millions and gave them no other employment in return.
('70', 232, 1, 15, 461215) With the destruction of hand ginning, carding, spinning and weaving to a certain extent, perished the other industries of India’s villages.
('70', 232, 1, 16, 461355) Continuous unemployment has induced in the people a kind of laziness which is most depressing.
('70', 232, 1, 17, 461450) Thus whilst the alien rule is undoubtedly responsible for the growing pauperism of the people, we are more responsible for it.
('70', 232, 1, 18, 461577) If the middle class people, who betrayed their trust and bartered away the economic independence of India for a mess of pottage, would now realize their error and take the message of the wheel to the villagers and induce them to shed their laziness and work at the wheel, we can ameliorate the condition of the people to a great extent.
('70', 232, 1, 19, 461914) It would be a terrible thing if laziness replaces industry and despair triumphs over hope.
('70', 232, 1, 20, 462005) The parliamentary programme is in the air.
('70', 232, 1, 21, 462048) It has come to stay and rightly.
('70', 232, 1, 22, 462081) But it cannot bring us independence.
('70', 232, 1, 23, 462118) Its function is strictly limited though quite necessary.
('70', 232, 1, 24, 462175) Its success will prevent the Government from claiming that Ordinance rule or any measure restricting our progress to the goal was sanctioned by popular representatives.
('70', 232, 1, 25, 462344) Hence the necessity for voters voting for the Congress candidates who dare not vote for unpopular measures without being liable to Congress discipline.
('70', 232, 1, 26, 462496) The success of that programme may also bring some relief in individual cases such as the release of Shri Subhas Bose or the detenus.
('70', 232, 1, 27, 462629) But that is not independence, political or economic.
('70', 232, 1, 28, 462682) Then look at it in another way.
('70', 232, 1, 29, 462714) Only a limited number of men and women can become members of legislatures, say 1,500. How many from this audience can become legislators?
('70', 232, 1, 30, 462852) And just now no
('70', 233, 0, 1, 462868) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 234
('70', 233, 1, 2, 462910) more than 3 1/2 crores can vote for these 1,500 members.
('70', 233, 1, 3, 462967) What about the remaining 31 1/2 crores?
('70', 233, 1, 4, 463007) In our conception of swaraj they are the real masters and the 3 1/2 crores are the former’s servants who in their turn are masters of the 1,500. Thus the latter are doubly servants, if they will be true to their trust.
('70', 233, 1, 5, 463226) But the 31 1/2 crores have also a trust to discharge towards themselves and the nation of which they as individuals are but tiny parts.
('70', 233, 1, 6, 463362) And if they remain lazy, know nothing of swaraj and how to win it, they will themselves become slaves of the 1,500 legislators.
('70', 233, 1, 7, 463490) For my argument the 3 1/2 crores of voters here belong to the same category as the 31 1/2 crores.
('70', 233, 1, 8, 463588) For if they do not become industrious and wise, they will be so many pawns in the hands of 1,500 players, it is of little consequence whether they are Congressmen or otherwise.
('70', 233, 1, 9, 463765) If the voters wake up only to register their votes every three years or more and then go off to sleep, their servants will become their masters.
('70', 233, 1, 10, 463910) The only way I know to prevent such a catastrophe is for the 35 crores to be industrious and wise.
('70', 233, 1, 11, 464009) This they can only be if they will take up the spinning wheel and the other village industries.
('70', 233, 1, 12, 464105) They will not take to them unintelligently.
('70', 233, 1, 13, 464149) I can tell you from experience that the effort means adult education of the correct type and requires possession of patience, moral fibre and a scientific and practical knowledge of the industry the worker seeks to introduce in the village of his choice.
('70', 233, 1, 14, 464404) In such a scheme the spinning wheel becomes its centre.
('70', 233, 1, 15, 464460) If you call it the solar system, the wheel becomes the golden disc and the industries the planets revolving round it in obedience to the inviolable law of the systems.
('70', 233, 1, 16, 464628) When the sun lost its illuminating power by the action of the East India Company, the planets lost their power and became invisible or almost so.
('70', 233, 1, 17, 464774) The sun is being reinstated in his past status now and the planets are regaining their motion in exact proportion to the strength of the sun.
('70', 233, 1, 18, 464916) Now perhaps you will understand the meaning and the message of the charkha.
('70', 233, 1, 19, 464992) I said in 1920 that if the Congress truly and successfully worked the programme laid down in 1920 including the fourfold constructive programme of khadi, communal unity, prohibition of intoxicants and removal by Hindus of untouchability, the attainment of swaraj within a year was a certainty.
('70', 233, 1, 20, 465286) I am neither sorry for nor ashamed of having made that declaration.
('70', 233, 1, 21, 465354) I would like to repeat that declaration before you today.
('70', 233, 1, 22, 465412) Whenever the fourfold programme is achieved in its fulness, you can have swaraj for the
('70', 234, 0, 1, 465500) VOL. 70: 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 235
('70', 234, 1, 2, 465548) asking.
('70', 234, 1, 3, 465556) For you will then have attained the power to take it.
('70', 234, 1, 4, 465610) Just think for a moment where the charkha stands today in your faith or action.
('70', 234, 1, 5, 465690) Is the mutual secret assasination of Bombay a sign of communal unity?
('70', 234, 1, 6, 465760) Where is total prohibition?
('70', 234, 1, 7, 465788) Have the Hindus rid themselves of untouchability root and branch?
('70', 234, 1, 8, 465854) One swallow does not make a summer.
('70', 234, 1, 9, 465890) Travancore’s great Proclamation may be the beginning of the end, but it is not the end.
('70', 234, 1, 10, 465978) If we remove the untouchability of Harijans, but treat Mussalmans or others as such, we have not removed the blot.
('70', 234, 1, 11, 466093) “All land belongs to God” has a deeper meaning.
('70', 234, 1, 12, 466141) Like the earth we, of it, also belong to God, and hence we must all feel like one and not erect boundary walls and issue prohibition decrees against one another.
('70', 234, 2, 13, 466303) This is the non violent way in action.
('70', 234, 2, 14, 466342) If we could fulfil this programme, there would be no need to offer civil disobedience, there would certainly be no need to do violence.
('70', 234, 2, 15, 466478) Thirty five crores of people conscious of their numerical strength as one man would be ashamed of doing violence to 70, 000 white men in India, no matter how capable they are of dealing destruction and administering poison gas to millions in a moment.
('70', 234, 2, 16, 466730) The charkha understood intelligently can spin not only economic salvation but can also revolutionize our minds and hearts and demonstrate to us that the non violent aproach to swaraj is the safest and the easiest.
('70', 234, 2, 17, 466944) Though the progress may seem slow, it will prove quickest in the long run.
('70', 234, 3, 18, 467019) Believe me if Jawaharlal is not in jail today, it is not because he is afraid of it.
('70', 234, 3, 19, 467104) He is quite capable of walking into prison doors as of mounting the gallows with a smile on his lips.
('70', 234, 3, 20, 467206) I do not think I have lost the power or faith in the efficacy of such suffering.
('70', 234, 3, 21, 467287) But there is no issue for it today as far as I can see.
('70', 234, 3, 22, 467343) But what I feel is that all that suffering can be avoided if by united faith and will we achieve the constructive programme.
('70', 234, 3, 23, 467468) If we can, I promise that we won’t need to struggle with or against the British nation, but Lord Linlithgow will come to us and own that he was mistaken in his disbelief of our non violence and truth and will undertake on behalf of his nation to abide by our decisions.
('70', 234, 3, 24, 467738) Whether he does or not, I am working towards that and no other.
('70', 234, 3, 25, 467802) “All belong to God”.

('70', 235, 2, 3, 467944) December 27, 1936
('70', 235, 3, 4, 467962) Mahatma Gandhi said that he expected that they would be tired by this time.
('70', 235, 3, 5, 468038) He himself had nothing much to say.
('70', 235, 3, 6, 468074) What he had to say he had already said in the morning at the exhibition.
('70', 235, 3, 7, 468147) He did not want to repeat it.
('70', 235, 3, 8, 468177) He was happy to see such a big assembly there, because the responsibility of bringing the Congress to a village was his.
('70', 235, 3, 9, 468298) When the Reception Committee authorities came to him he told them certain things.
('70', 235, 3, 10, 468380) He told them to throw the responsibility on God and start work.
('70', 235, 3, 11, 468444) There had been several criticisms against the step taken in holding the Congress in a village.
('70', 235, 3, 12, 468539) Several newspapers had criticized it and had dwelt upon the shortcomings.
('70', 235, 3, 13, 468613) The Reception Committee did not have sufficient money.
('70', 235, 3, 14, 468668) Nevertheless they all saw that the Congress here was the same as before.
('70', 235, 3, 15, 468741) In fact the village Congress had turned out to be a bigger one than previous Congresses.
('70', 235, 3, 16, 468830) He had told the Reception Committee to be prepared for the needs of one lakh of people.
('70', 235, 3, 17, 468918) During the flag salutation this morning alone, according to the estimate of some, two lakhs of people were present.
('70', 235, 3, 18, 469034) Allowing for differences of estimate, he was sure there must have been at least one lakh of people.
('70', 235, 3, 19, 469134) Such a large influx of people had made the Reception authorities fear whether they would be able to meet their needs.
('70', 235, 3, 20, 469252) Proceeding, Gandhiji paid a compliment to the ‘Bhangis’ and said that there were people among those who came to Faizpur who did what they should not do in the interests of sanitation.
('70', 235, 3, 21, 469436) They no doubt had a hospital, but it was not big enough for a large number of people to be treated at once.
('70', 235, 3, 22, 469544) He had in fact suggested that the Reception Committee should now ask people to begin to leave.
('70', 235, 3, 23, 469639) He felt, however, that they should hereafter continue to hold the Congress in a village.
('70', 235, 3, 24, 469728) They should take a vow there and then not to hold the Congress in towns in future.
('70', 235, 3, 25, 469811) The drawbacks that they saw there could easily be obviated.
('70', 235, 3, 26, 469871) There was no doubt in his mind that it would be very easy to hold the Congress in a village.
('70', 235, 3, 27, 469964) By doing so the amount they spent could be considerably economized.
('70', 235, 3, 28, 470032) But according to him even that amount was big enough.
('70', 235, 3, 29, 470086) He had wanted the Faizpur session to be completed within Rs. 5,000 but that was found to be not possible.
('70', 235, 3, 30, 470192) They did not get sufficient support and they had to pay a big rent for ground.
('70', 235, 3, 31, 470271) His idea was that no rent should be paid for the ground on which the Congress was held.
('70', 235, 3, 32, 470359) The Reception Committee were also compelled to hold the Congress in Khandesh because they could not have got the same number of volunteers elsewhere.
('70', 235, 3, 33, 470509) However, in spite of the impediments, the Reception Committee had carried on their work and though there was rain, they did not lose heart.
('70', 235, 3, 34, 470649) If they really wanted to go into the villages and take the message of the Congress to the villagers they should take a vow to hold all future Congresses in villages.
('70', 235, 3, 35, 470815) Mahatma Gandhi said that villagers also would have to understand what the people who wanted to get swaraj wanted them to do.
('70', 235, 3, 36, 470940) The President and the Socialists were saying: “You merely sleep after paying four annas.
('70', 235, 3, 37, 471029) Mere payment of four annas does not show that you are real Congressmen.”

('70', 236, 1, 2, 471151) Preparations for the Congress are not over in a day but they take a number of months.
('70', 236, 1, 3, 471237) They have to go round and get things ready.
('70', 236, 1, 4, 471281) This sort of connection that has been established should be continued all the year through.
('70', 236, 1, 5, 471373) If you want this you must take a vow that you will hold future Congresses in villages.
('70', 236, 2, 6, 471460) The decision of the Constituent Assembly can be taken only when you have swaraj at your door.
('70', 236, 2, 7, 471554) You can call a Constituent Assembly when you have got full strength.
('70', 236, 2, 8, 471623) It cannot meet in Delhi but in the remotest village.
('70', 236, 2, 9, 471676) Swaraj can be got only by increasing our strength on all sides.
('70', 236, 2, 10, 471740) If we increase that strength, we can see swaraj coming soon.
('70', 236, 2, 11, 471801) What I asked you to do in 1920 still remains unaccomplished—charkha, prohibition and removal of untouch ability.
('70', 236, 2, 12, 471914) If you leave these things unaccomplished, hear an old man saying: You will have lost swaraj.

('70', 236, 5, 15, 472072) December 28, 1936
('70', 236, 6, 16, 472090) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL,
('70', 236, 7, 17, 472110) If you finish today, as I hope you will, you will perhaps let me go away tomorrow after midday.
('70', 236, 7, 18, 472206) If you have appreciated my suggestion about holding the Congress in villages hereafter, I would like you to ask the Congress to revert to the old rule of holding it in between February and March.
('70', 236, 7, 19, 472402) The sufferings of the thousands in wintry weather should be avoided if possible.
('70', 236, 7, 20, 472483) Parliamentarians should fit in with this arrangement.
('70', 236, 7, 21, 472537) There is no reason why, if the Congress secures a majority in the legislatures, they should not have vacation as they have during Xmas, Easter, etc.
('70', 236, 7, 22, 472686) I have told Sarup 1 that land somewhere must be secured soon and then house to house collections started for Kamala memorial.

('70', 237, 4, 7, 473181) You pray for him.
('70', 237, 4, 8, 473199) But forget about seeing him.
('70', 237, 4, 9, 473228) Whatever he had to get from you he has got.
('70', 237, 4, 10, 473272) You can come to Segaon on the 1st instead of the 3rd.
('70', 237, 4, 11, 473326) Intimate the date to Mahadev so that the carriage may take you straight to Segaon from the station.
('70', 237, 4, 12, 473426) If you want, you may stop at Maganwadi to see Kumarappa.
('70', 237, 4, 13, 473483) You cannot go to Travancore with me.
('70', 237, 4, 14, 473520) We shall think about the future at Segaon.

('70', 237, 8, 18, 473675) December 28, 1936 1
('70', 237, 9, 19, 473695) I am sorry that it being my day of silence I may not speak today.
('70', 237, 9, 20, 473761) I have no doubt in my mind that we must have a common language for intercommunication throughout India.
('70', 237, 9, 21, 473865) And I have also no doubt that that language can only be Hindi, i.e., Hindustani.
('70', 237, 9, 22, 473946) It is the language that is understood by the Hindus and Muslims alike in northern India.
('70', 237, 9, 23, 474035) English can never take its place.
('70', 237, 10, 24, 474069) From a photostat of the Hindi: G.N. 10995

('70', 238, 2, 3, 474279) [December 29, 1936] 2
('70', 238, 3, 4, 474301) I know the ordeals through which you have had to pass.
('70', 238, 3, 5, 474356) Whether I congratulate you or not is going to make not the slightest difference.
('70', 238, 3, 6, 474437) You all worked not for praise or reward but for the love of it, and such people do not need any congratulation.
('70', 238, 3, 7, 474549) And how dare I congratulate those who are my peers in the service of the country?
('70', 238, 3, 8, 474631) But I would ask of you one thing.
('70', 238, 3, 9, 474665) I would ask every one of you to make a note of your experiences, especially the difficulties you had to contend against, and pass it on to Sardar Vallabhbhai and me.
('70', 238, 3, 10, 474831) You must give me a detailed account of the way in which you gathered your material, the expenses, and your own failures and successes.
('70', 238, 3, 11, 474966) They should prove very useful for future guidance.
('70', 238, 3, 12, 475017) Nandalal Bose ought to teach us a little of his art.
('70', 238, 3, 13, 475070) You are all pioneers in this great experiment and your genius for organization has made it a success.
('70', 238, 3, 14, 475172) This is a distinct step towards the attainment of swaraj by non violent means, and it is a great thing that Maharashtra has led the way.

('70', 238, 6, 17, 475360) [December 29, 1936]
('70', 238, 7, 18, 475380) You are all mute servants, and you have earned the praise of everyone who has come here.
('70', 238, 7, 19, 475469) I have been told that you were always quick to carry out orders, never to issue them, that you did not hesitate to do what are supposed to be meanest jobs.
('70', 238, 7, 20, 475625) But that is the great merit of Maharashtra which has a very great number of selfless workers who have kept before themselves not the ideal to lead but to serve.
('70', 238, 7, 21, 475786) If Tilak Maharaj taught us that swaraj is our birth right, he also taught us that selfless service is the key to win it.
('70', 238, 7, 22, 475907) Selfless service may have been in existence before Tilak Maharaj came, but he it was who systematized it.
('70', 238, 7, 23, 476013) He began public life by pledging himself to work on a mere pittance, and ever since Maharashtra has had a galaxy of workers who have been content to work on a pittance.
('70', 238, 7, 24, 476182) They do not need Rs. 75 or
('70', 238, 8, 25, 476209) 1 This and the two items that follow have been extracted from Mahadev Desai’s account “The Week at Faizpur II”.
('70', 238, 8, 26, 476321) 2 Gandhiji left Faizpur on this date.
('70', 239, 0, 1, 476359) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 240
('70', 239, 1, 2, 476401) 100 a month like, for instance, workers in Gujarat, but Rs. 15 a month suffices for them.
('70', 239, 1, 3, 476491) In some cases contact with Gujarat has spoilt them, but in the majority of cases they are still unspoilt.
('70', 239, 1, 4, 476597) The credit for the noble way in which you volunteers have acquitted yourselves, therefore, belongs to the well known workers who have set a great example.
('70', 239, 1, 5, 476752) They are the pride and the honour of Maharashtra.
('70', 239, 1, 6, 476802) May you all follow in their footsteps.

('70', 239, 4, 9, 476894) [December 29,1936]
('70', 239, 5, 10, 476913) Why should I congratulate you?
('70', 239, 5, 11, 476944) You should thank me that I gave you this opportunity to atone for our sins.
('70', 239, 5, 12, 477020) And congratulations too you will deserve when you fulfil the whole task.
('70', 239, 5, 13, 477093) It is a noble profession, and one which our graduates and educated men might well turn to in order to earn their living.
('70', 239, 5, 14, 477214) We have to reduce the thing to a science and to prepare treatises on sanitation.
('70', 239, 5, 15, 477295) The ordinary Bhangi cannot do this.
('70', 239, 5, 16, 477331) It is only educated Bhangis who can do this, and only those who will dedicate themselves to this work.
('70', 239, 5, 17, 477434) That will also mean the end of untouchability which is as bad amongst the untouchables themselves as between them and the so called touchables.
('70', 239, 5, 18, 477578) Do not forget what you have learnt here.
('70', 239, 5, 19, 477619) I would ask you to make it your duty wherever you are and wherever you go to be ministers of cleanliness.
('70', 239, 5, 20, 477725) You did creditable work, but you might have done better.
('70', 239, 5, 21, 477782) What about the villages in our vicinity like Faizpur, Khiroda and Savda?
('70', 239, 5, 22, 477855) They are as filthy as ever.
('70', 239, 5, 23, 477883) The Congress in future will have to be a permanently civilizing influence so far at least as sanitation is concerned, in the whole of the area where it is held.
('70', 239, 5, 24, 478044) ‘Bhangi’ will then not be a name to be disliked or tolerated, but to be coveted.
('70', 239, 5, 25, 478125) For ‘Bhangi’ will no more mean the doer of a dirty job, but a purifier and a disinfector, a preventor of disease and epidemics.

('70', 241, 7, 14, 480230) I have your letter and a copy of your Award.

('70', 241, 7, 16, 480374) Shouldn’t we, therefore, withdraw its case from the Umpire?

('70', 241, 7, 20, 480594) We will send whichever is ready earlier.

('70', 241, 12, 26, 480894) GANDHIJI: Do you therefore say that other religions are untrue?
('70', 241, 13, 27, 480958) KRZENSKI: If others are convinced that their religions are true they are saved.
('70', 241, 14, 28, 481038) 1 Not available 2 Extracted from Mahadev Desai’s “Weekly Letter”.
('70', 241, 14, 29, 481104) Krzenski was a Polish professor of philosophy.
('70', 241, 15, 30, 481151) 3 From the manuscript of Mahadev Desai’s Diary 4 Krzenski had said that according to him Catholicism was the only true religion.
('70', 242, 0, 1, 481280) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 243
('70', 242, 1, 2, 481329) G. Therefore you will say that everyone would be saved even through untruth.
('70', 242, 2, 3, 481406) For you say that if a man really and sincerely believes in what is as a matter of fact untruth, he is saved.
('70', 242, 2, 4, 481515) Would you not also hold, therefore, that your own way may be untrue but that you are convinced that it is true and therefore you will be saved?
('70', 242, 3, 5, 481659) K. But I have studied all religions and have found that mine is the only true
('70', 242, 4, 6, 481737) religion.
('70', 242, 5, 7, 481747) G. But so have others studied other religions.
('70', 242, 5, 8, 481794) What about them?
('70', 242, 5, 9, 481811) Well, I go further and tell you that religion is one and it has several branches which are all equal.
('70', 242, 6, 10, 481913) K. I accept that no religion lacks divine inspiration but all have not the same
('70', 242, 7, 11, 481993) truth, because all have not the same light.
('70', 242, 8, 12, 482037) G. It is an essentially untrue position to take, for a seeker after truth, that he alone is in absolute possession of truth.
('70', 242, 8, 13, 482162) What is happening to the poor astronomers today?
('70', 242, 8, 14, 482211) They are changing their position every day, and there are scientists who impeach even Einstein’s latest theory.
('70', 242, 9, 15, 482323) But I have examined the arguments in favour of other religions.
('70', 242, 10, 16, 482387) G. But it is an intellectual examination.
('70', 242, 10, 17, 482429) You require different scales to weigh spiritual truths.
('70', 242, 10, 18, 482485) Either we are all untrue—quite a logical position to take—but since truth does not come out of untruth it is better to say that we all have truth but not the complete truth.
('70', 242, 10, 19, 482659) For God reveals His truth to instruments that are imperfect.
('70', 242, 10, 20, 482720) Raindrops of purest distilled water become diluted or polluted as soon as they come in contact with mother earth.
('70', 242, 10, 21, 482834) My submission is that your position is arrogant.
('70', 242, 10, 22, 482883) But I suggest to you a better position.
('70', 242, 10, 23, 482923) Accept all religions as equal, for all have the same root and the same laws of growth.
('70', 242, 11, 24, 483010) K. It is necessary to examine every religion philosophically and find out
('70', 242, 12, 25, 483084) which is more harmonious, more perfect.
('70', 242, 13, 26, 483124) G. That presupposes that all religions are in watertight compartments.
('70', 242, 13, 27, 483195) That is wrong.
('70', 242, 13, 28, 483210) They are always growing.
('70', 242, 13, 29, 483235) Let us not limit God’s function.
('70', 242, 13, 30, 483268) He may reveal Himself in a thousand ways and a thousand times.
('70', 243, 0, 1, 483331) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 244
('70', 243, 1, 2, 483373) Now the professor switched on to the next question, viz., that of fighting
('70', 243, 2, 3, 483448) materialism.
('70', 243, 3, 4, 483461) G. It is no use trying to fight these forces without giving up the idea of conversion, which I assure you is the deadliest poison that ever sapped the fountain of truth.
('70', 243, 4, 5, 483631) K. But I have a great respect for your religion.
('70', 243, 5, 6, 483680) G. Not enough.
('70', 243, 5, 7, 483695) I had that feeling myself one day, but I found that it was not enough.
('70', 243, 5, 8, 483766) Unless I accept the position that all religions are equal, and I have as much regard for other religions as I have for my own, I would not be able to live in the boiling war around me.
('70', 243, 5, 9, 483951) Any make believe combination of spiritual forces is doomed to failure if this fundamental position is not accepted.
('70', 243, 5, 10, 484067) I read and get all my inspiration from the Gita.
('70', 243, 5, 11, 484116) But I also read the Bible and the Koran to enrich my own religion.
('70', 243, 5, 12, 484183) I incorporate all that is good in other religions.
('70', 243, 6, 13, 484234) K. That is your goodwill.
('70', 243, 7, 14, 484260) G. That is not enough.
('70', 243, 8, 15, 484283) K. But I have great respect for you.
('70', 243, 9, 16, 484320) G. Not enough.
('70', 243, 9, 17, 484335) If I were to join the Catholic Church you would have greater respect for me.
('70', 243, 10, 18, 484412) K. Oh yes, if you became a Catholic you would be as great as St. Francis.
('70', 243, 11, 19, 484486) G. But not otherwise?
('70', 243, 11, 20, 484508) A Hindu cannot be a St. Francis?
('70', 243, 11, 21, 484541) Poor Hindu!
('70', 243, 12, 22, 484553) K. But may I take your photograph?
('70', 243, 13, 23, 484588) G. No, surely you don’t care for materialism!
('70', 243, 13, 24, 484634) And it is all materialism, isn’t it?

('70', 244, 2, 3, 484771) SEGAON, WARDHA, January 3, 1937
('70', 244, 3, 4, 484803) DEAR FIELDEN,
('70', 244, 4, 5, 484817) I welcome the confidence you have given me.
('70', 244, 4, 6, 484861) My sympathies are with you in your troubles.
('70', 244, 4, 7, 484906) But you have to take them philosophically if you must stick to the post 2 even though it be to the good of the country.
('70', 244, 4, 8, 485026) Any attack on your personal character is a vile thing.
('70', 244, 4, 9, 485081) But every society has its share of blackmailers.
('70', 244, 4, 10, 485130) These you should laugh at.
('70', 244, 4, 11, 485157) Then there are the critics.
('70', 244, 4, 12, 485185) You must not expect informed criticism.
('70', 244, 4, 13, 485225) Very few write for the public good; most write for money.
('70', 244, 4, 14, 485283) Then there is the third class who don’t come to you as you would have them do.
('70', 244, 4, 15, 485362) They don’t in spite of themselves.
('70', 244, 4, 16, 485397) Those who know you would like to avail themselves of the facilities you may give them, but they know that the harm done by such co operation will be greater than the good intended.
('70', 244, 4, 17, 485578) Take Rajkumari herself.
('70', 244, 4, 18, 485602) Even she could go only a certain distance and no further.
('70', 244, 4, 19, 485660) You must not grieve over this but take it as inevitable in the circumstances surrounding us.

('70', 244, 8, 23, 485846) January 3, 1937
('70', 244, 9, 24, 485862) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL,
('70', 244, 10, 25, 485882) I wish I could have gone with you to Ajanta.
('70', 244, 10, 26, 485927) Before I received your letter, I had spoken strongly to Khan Saheb and urged him to send Mehrtaj to Vakil’s school.
('70', 244, 10, 27, 486043) But he was adamant.
('70', 244, 10, 28, 486063) He does not want her to go to a mixed school.
('70', 244, 10, 29, 486109) I spoke to Mehrtaj too.
('70', 244, 10, 30, 486133) She is undoubtedly restless.
('70', 244, 10, 31, 486162) But Khan Saheb is sanguine and believes that Mehrtaj will recover her usual cheerfulness.
('70', 244, 11, 32, 486252) 1 Extracted from the addressee’s article “You Must Not Grieve”.
('70', 244, 11, 33, 486316) The letter, he says, was in response to a sort of “last appeal” against attacks on him from the Government of India, the Congress and the Press.
('70', 244, 11, 34, 486461) 2 The addressee was the Director General of the All India Radio.

('70', 245, 1, 3, 486636) I had a brief talk with Sarup over the memorial 1. I am sure that before anything else, at least the ground must be acquired.
('70', 245, 1, 4, 486762) There need be no insistence on having the plot you described to me or another near Anand Bhawan.

('70', 245, 6, 10, 486997) It seems I have not to come to Tr 3. Just yet at any rate.
('70', 245, 6, 11, 487056) Kanti could hardly come even if I have to go there.
('70', 245, 6, 12, 487108) He was with me for three days at Faizpur.

('70', 245, 12, 21, 487517) The Umpire should not be given the trouble of coming here in his present delicate state of health.
('70', 245, 12, 22, 487616) I will, therefore, keep myself ready to go to Poona.
('70', 245, 12, 23, 487669) While sending him the translation of my Award, I have asked him to give the dates convenient to him 4. Which dates will suit you?
('70', 245, 12, 24, 487799) I have been delaying my going to Travancore.
('70', 245, 12, 25, 487844) I can now cancel that programme and go to Poona on the 7th.

('70', 247, 3, 6, 489452) You cannot celebrate the ‘Mohamed Ali Day’ better than by all of you resolving to establish heart unity with Hindus.
('70', 247, 3, 7, 489569) Brotherhood which Islam teaches is a mockery if it excludes people belonging to the other faiths.

('70', 247, 12, 20, 490151) January 4, 1937
('70', 247, 13, 21, 490167) MAHADEV, My memory is daily getting more confused.
('70', 247, 13, 22, 490218) I did have a vague recollection that I had written to Duncan, but I dictated a letter to him since his letter was lying in the file.
('70', 247, 13, 23, 490351) It was good that you remembered.
('70', 248, 0, 1, 490384) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 249
('70', 248, 1, 2, 490433) My memory has gone but my laxity has not.
('70', 248, 1, 3, 490475) I could have saved time and paper and myself from shame if I had noted down on the letter itself while replying to Duncan.
('70', 248, 1, 4, 490598) “Crooked are all the limbs of a camel; how can they be kept hidden, do what one will?” Akte, with a straight face denied four or five times his boorish conduct.
('70', 248, 1, 5, 490759) But afterwards he felt remorse, confessed everything and repented of his conduct very much.
('70', 248, 1, 6, 490851) However, he stuck to what he had said regarding Buva.
('70', 248, 1, 7, 490905) The witness that he had produced also boldly stuck to his statement before Buva.
('70', 248, 1, 8, 490986) My suspicion against Buva is deepening.
('70', 248, 1, 9, 491026) He seems to be a very strange man.
('70', 248, 1, 10, 491061) The letter to Pingle and the papers to be forwarded to him which I sent with Rajkumari will throw more light.
('70', 248, 1, 11, 491171) But it is enough that you know.
('70', 248, 1, 12, 491203) Don’t spend time in reading the papers.
('70', 248, 1, 13, 491243) You can tell all this to J. Agatha didn’t speak at all yesterday.
('70', 248, 1, 14, 491309) Polak asked one or two questions in public.
('70', 248, 1, 15, 491353) The rest of the time was spent on titbits.
('70', 248, 1, 16, 491396) Fortunately Polak and others came very late: at 4.30. You haven’t, therefore, missed anything.
('70', 248, 1, 17, 491491) Polak’s talk was private and as such it cannot be reported.
('70', 248, 1, 18, 491551) I am going to make you laugh when we meet.
('70', 248, 1, 19, 491594) Dinkar’s talk means a speech.
('70', 248, 1, 20, 491624) I will tell you about that also some time.
('70', 248, 1, 21, 491667) Agatha has come today.
('70', 248, 1, 22, 491690) But she can’t even look at me.
('70', 248, 1, 23, 491721) Tomorrow she will come for a talk.
('70', 248, 1, 24, 491756) You also may come and spend the day here.
('70', 248, 1, 25, 491798) Durga and Bablo also may come if they want to.

('70', 248, 1, 27, 491890) Write to Burbage and tell him that I have referred to his letter in Harijan.
('70', 248, 1, 28, 491967) Send him a copy also.
('70', 248, 1, 29, 491989) I will break my silence late at 9.45. If, therefore, the students wish to have a talk with me, they can do so only tomorrow.

('70', 249, 1, 4, 492747) That will prevent in some measure the destruction of the cattle wealth that is taking place today.

('70', 249, 11, 19, 493551) The agitation in Cochin goes on.

('70', 249, 11, 22, 493680) All the same I have asked the Dewan to send me a telegram.
('70', 249, 11, 23, 493739) If it comes, I will go.
('70', 249, 11, 24, 493763) I have also written to Ramachandran to consult Rajaji.
('70', 249, 11, 25, 493818) Do you wish anything more than this?
('70', 249, 11, 26, 493855) I will read the book you have sent.
('70', 249, 11, 27, 493891) I will try to find Rajaji’s article.
('70', 249, 11, 28, 493928) Meanwhile the talks I am conducting are going on.

('70', 251, 4, 7, 495535) And that too after assuring me that you were indifferent to such things.
('70', 251, 4, 8, 495608) However, let the past be buried.
('70', 251, 4, 9, 495641) This is merely to inform you that Ramachandran wires you and Khan Saheb could go with me.
('70', 251, 4, 10, 495731) I do not want to bank on that wire.
('70', 251, 4, 11, 495767) I expect confirmation from C.P. I hope you had a good journey and that you have no trouble.

('70', 252, 7, 8, 496631) You may continue to write in English by all means, but permit me to write in Gujarati.
('70', 252, 7, 9, 496718) Teach your assistant to read my handwriting.
('70', 252, 7, 10, 496763) I don’t want you to waste your time in doing so.
('70', 252, 7, 11, 496812) Just as you are conscious of the value of my time, I am conscious of that of yours.
('70', 252, 7, 12, 496896) I also know that my handwriting is not easy to read.
('70', 252, 7, 13, 496949) How can I disregard your request?
('70', 252, 7, 14, 496983) But you know that I don’t accept any responsibility in a casual manner.
('70', 252, 7, 15, 497055) I agree to be the president of a meeting only when I have control over its proceedings and have faith in it.
('70', 252, 7, 16, 497164) Perhaps you do not know how much I contributed to the formation of the Association 1 and to carrying on through it the agitation against the indenture system.
('70', 252, 7, 17, 497323) Probably Natarajan is acquainted with the history of it.
('70', 252, 7, 18, 497380) Vaze was not there at that time.
('70', 252, 7, 19, 497413) I am aware of the great injustice about to be done to the Zanzibar Indians.
('70', 252, 7, 20, 497489) But that injustice cannot be prevented by one meeting or by my presiding over it.
('70', 252, 7, 21, 497571) Before that I myself should do something.
('70', 252, 7, 22, 497613) I should enter into correspondence with the Government, study the Binder Report, see a representative of Zanzibar if there is any here.
('70', 252, 7, 23, 497749) Our people there are divided just as they are here and are selfish and lethargic.
('70', 252, 7, 24, 497831) If we cannot get them to do any work, then also we will not succeed.
('70', 252, 7, 25, 497900) How can all this be done?
('70', 252, 7, 26, 497926) Where am I to find the necessary time?
('70', 252, 7, 27, 497965) “Better one’s own duty, bereft of merit, than another’s well performed; better death in the dicharge of one’s duty, another’s duty is fraught with danger.” 2 For me at present the work about overseas Indians is another’s duty.
('70', 252, 7, 28, 498192) Why do you involve me in it?
('70', 252, 7, 29, 498221) Nothing will be achieved by my becoming the president.
('70', 252, 7, 30, 498276) Please don’t dismiss my argument as advanced by an impractical man.

('70', 253, 1, 4, 498569) If, however, you cannot swallow my argument, send me the Binder Report and explain to me whatever you feel it is necessary to explain.
('70', 253, 1, 5, 498704) If there is anybody who knows all the facts send him to explain them to me.
('70', 253, 1, 6, 498780) If you can spare the time and wish to come, you may do so.

('70', 253, 5, 16, 499302) A correspondent from Greenville, S.C., U.S.A., writes enclosing a clipping from an American newspaper: 1
('70', 253, 6, 17, 499407) The clipping contains an account of my illness of last year and ends.
('70', 253, 7, 18, 499477) The recently powerful spokesman, Gandhi, flying in the face of all modern scientific knowledge and ignoring the tremendous number of human beings slain by such small insects, is reported as having stated in The Times of India, June 1935: “We have no right to take the lives of mosquitoes, flies, lice, rats or fleas.
('70', 253, 7, 19, 499794) They have as much right to live as we.” I am afraid my correspondent cannot have the pleasure of espousing my cause in the manner he proposes.
('70', 253, 7, 20, 499937) For I did make the statement attributed to me, though I qualified it by saying that in the present state of modern ignorance, and especially my own ignorance, I did countenance campaigns of killing rats, fleas, mosquitoes and the like.
('70', 253, 7, 21, 500173) But I do believe that all God’s creatures have the right to live as much as we have.
('70', 253, 7, 22, 500258) Instead of prescribing the killing of the so called
('70', 253, 8, 23, 500310) 1 The letter is not reproduced here.
('70', 253, 8, 24, 500347) The correspondent had expressed his disbelief in the newspaper report of Gandhiji’s views concerning killing of flies and mosquitoes and said if Gandhiji would disavow “such nonsense” he would have the disavowal placed in all the newspapers of America.
('70', 254, 0, 1, 500600) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 255
('70', 254, 1, 2, 500649) injurious fellow creatures of ours as a duty, if men of knowledge had devoted their gift to discovering ways of dealing with them otherwise than by killing them, we would be living in a world befitting our status as men—animals endowed with reason and the power of choosing between good and evil, right and wrong, violence and non violence, truth and untruth.
('70', 254, 1, 3, 501009) I prefer to be called a coward or a fool or worse, to denying for the sake of being considered a wise man what I believe to be a fundamental truth of life.
('70', 254, 1, 4, 501165) Marvellous as the progress of physical sciences undoubtedly is, it only humbles us and enables us to know that we know hardly anything of the mysteries of Nature.
('70', 254, 1, 5, 501328) In the spiritual realm, we make little or no progress.
('70', 254, 1, 6, 501383) The physical has overwhelmed the spiritual in us.
('70', 254, 1, 7, 501433) We hardly like to own the latter’s existence.
('70', 254, 1, 8, 501479) And yet the question of killing and non killing, of man’s relation to his human 1 fellow creatures, belongs to the spiritual realm.
('70', 254, 1, 9, 501611) Its proper solution will surely revolutionize our thoughts, speech and action.
('70', 254, 1, 10, 501690) Both my intellect and heart refuse to believe that the so called noxious life has been created for destruction by man.
('70', 254, 1, 11, 501809) God is good and wise.
('70', 254, 1, 12, 501831) A good and wise God cannot be so bad and so unwise as to create to no purpose.
('70', 254, 1, 13, 501910) It is more conducive to reason to own our ignorance and assume that every form of life has a useful purpose which we must patiently strive to discover.
('70', 254, 1, 14, 502062) I verily believe that man’s habit of killing man on the slightest pretext has darkened his reason and he gives himself liberties with other life which he would shudder to take if he really believed that God is a God of Love and Mercy.
('70', 254, 1, 15, 502297) Anyway, though for fear of death I may kill tigers, snakes, fleas, mosquitoes and the like, I ever pray for illumination that will shed all fear of death and, thus refusing to take life know the better way for “Taught by the Power that pities me I learn to pity them.”

('70', 254, 4, 18, 502614) It was stated in Faizpur during the Congress Week that there are nearly 3 1 2 crores of voters who will vote for candidates for the provincial legislatures.
('70', 254, 4, 19, 502771) Harijan workers can utilize the occasion of the elections for educating the voters on the question of untouchability
('70', 254, 5, 20, 502888) 1 This should be “sub human”; vide “Notes” sub title “An Important Correction”, 16 1 1937
('70', 255, 0, 1, 502978) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 256
('70', 255, 1, 2, 503020) and of committing the candidates definitely to one side or the other.
('70', 255, 1, 3, 503090) They can be asked for instance these questions: Are you in favour of complete removal of untouchability?
('70', 255, 1, 4, 503195) Are you in favour of removing the legal bar on the grounds of custom and legislation permitting temple authorities to open temples to Harijans where savarna Hindu opinion is ripe for the step?
('70', 255, 1, 5, 503388) Are you in favour of enforcing the common law in the matter of Harijans freely using public wells, schools, and the like?
('70', 255, 1, 6, 503510) A correspondent writes to say that there is a conspiracy of silence among candidates on this question.
('70', 255, 1, 7, 503613) If there is, it can be broken by energetic Harijan workers simply putting at voters’ meetings questions like those I have suggested.
('70', 255, 1, 8, 503746) Enlightened voters interested in the purification of Hinduism can do a great deal to educate and mould pubic opinion in this matter.
('70', 255, 1, 9, 503879) It is a pity that the question of untouchability can at all become an issue between rival candidates or between candidates and electors.
('70', 255, 1, 10, 504016) But pity or no pity, we have to face the facts as they are today.

('70', 255, 3, 12, 504100) 292. ‘A HUMBLE VILLAGER OF BIRBHUM’
('70', 255, 4, 13, 504136) ‘A Humble Villager of Birbhum’ living in Santiniketan sends me through Deenabandhu Andrews the following questions: 1. What is an ideal Indian village in your esteemed opinion and how far is it practicable to reconstruct a village on the basis of an ‘Ideal Village’ in the present social and political situation of India?
('70', 255, 4, 14, 504458) 2. Which of the village problems should a worker try to solve first of all and how should he proceed?
('70', 255, 4, 15, 504560) 3. What should be the special theme of village exhibitions and museums in a miniature form?
('70', 255, 4, 16, 504652) How should such exhibitons be best utilized for the reconstruction of villages?
('70', 255, 4, 17, 504732) 1. An ideal Indian village will be so constructed as to lend itself to perfect sanitation.
('70', 255, 4, 18, 504823) It will have cottages with sufficient light and ventilation built of a material obtainable within a radius of five miles of it.
('70', 255, 4, 19, 504951) The cottages will have courtyards enabling householders to plant vegetables for domestic use and to house their cattle.
('70', 255, 4, 20, 505071) The village lanes and streets will be free of all avoidable dust.
('70', 255, 4, 21, 505137) It will have wells according to its needs and accessible to all.
('70', 255, 4, 22, 505202) It will have houses of worship for all; also a common meeting place, a village common for
('70', 256, 0, 1, 505292) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 257
('70', 256, 1, 2, 505341) grazing its cattle, a co operative dairy, primary and secondary schools in which industrial education will be the central fact, and it will have panchayats for settling disputes.
('70', 256, 1, 3, 505520) It will produce its own grains, vegetables and fruit, and its own khadi.
('70', 256, 1, 4, 505593) This is roughly my idea of a model village.
('70', 256, 1, 5, 505637) In the present circumstances its cottages will remain what they are with slight improvements.
('70', 256, 1, 6, 505731) Given a good zamindar, where there is one, or co operation among the people, almost the whole of the programme other than model cottages can be worked out at an expenditure within the means of the villagers including the zamindar or zamindars, without Government assistance.
('70', 256, 1, 7, 506006) With that assistance there is no limit to the possibility of village reconstruction.
('70', 256, 1, 8, 506091) But my task just now is to discover what the villagers can do to help themselves if they have mutual co operation and contribute voluntary labour for the common good.
('70', 256, 1, 9, 506258) I am convinced that they can, under intelligent guidance, double the village income as distinguished from individual income.
('70', 256, 1, 10, 506383) There are in our villages inexhaustible resources not for commercial purposes in every case but certainly for local purposes in almost every case.
('70', 256, 1, 11, 506530) The greatest tragedy is the hopeless unwillingness of the villagers to better their lot.
('70', 256, 1, 12, 506619) 2. The very first problem the village worker will solve is its sanitation.
('70', 256, 1, 13, 506694) It is the most neglected of all the problems that baffle workers and that undermine physical well being and breed disease.
('70', 256, 1, 14, 506817) If the worker became a voluntary Bhangi, he would begin by collecting night soil and turning it into manure and sweeping village streets.
('70', 256, 1, 15, 506955) He will tell people how and where they should perform daily functions and speak to them on the value of sanitation and the great injury caused by the neglect.
('70', 256, 1, 16, 507114) The worker will continue to do the work whether the villagers listen to him or no.
('70', 256, 1, 17, 507197) 3. The spinning wheel should be the central theme of all such village exhibitions and the industries suited to the particular locality should revolve round it.
('70', 256, 1, 18, 507357) An exhibition thus arranged would naturally become an object lesson for the villagers and an educational treat when it is accompanied by demonstrations, lectures and leaflets.

('70', 257, 2, 3, 507604) THE COW AND THE HARIJAN In my conversations with Dr. Mott, at one stage of it I said, “Would you preach the Gospel to a cow?
('70', 257, 2, 4, 507729) Well, some of the untouchables are worse than cows in understanding.
('70', 257, 2, 5, 507798) I mean they no more distinguish between the relative merits of Islam and Hinduism and Christianity than a cow.” 1 Some Missionary friends have taken exception to the analogy.
('70', 257, 2, 6, 507973) I have no remorse about the propriety of the analogy.
('70', 257, 2, 7, 508027) There could be no offence meant to Harijans because the cow is a sacred animal.
('70', 257, 2, 8, 508107) I worship her as I worship my mother.
('70', 257, 2, 9, 508145) Both are givers of milk.
('70', 257, 2, 10, 508170) And so far as understanding is concerned I do maintain that there are, be it said to the discredit of superior class Hindus, thousands of Harijans who can no more understand the merits and demerits of different religions than a cow.
('70', 257, 2, 11, 508403) That after a long course of training Harijans can have their intelligence developed in a manner a cow’s cannot, is irrelevant to the present discussion.
('70', 257, 3, 12, 508556) A STUDENT’S DIFFICULTY A student asks:
('70', 257, 4, 13, 508595) What should a matriculate or an undergraduate who is unfortunately father of two or three children do in order to procure a living wage, and what should he do when he is forced to marry against his will and before even the age of twenty five?
('70', 257, 4, 14, 508838) The simplest answer that occurs to me is that a student who does not know how to support his wife and children or who marries against his will has studied to no purpose.
('70', 257, 4, 15, 509008) But that is past history for him.
('70', 257, 4, 16, 509042) The perplexed student deserves a helpful answer.
('70', 257, 4, 17, 509091) He does not say what is his requirement.
('70', 257, 4, 18, 509132) If he does not pitch it high because he is a matriculate and will put himself on a level with the ordinary labourer, he should have no difficulty in earning a livelihood.
('70', 257, 4, 19, 509303) His intelligence should help his hands and feet and enable him to do better than the labourer who has not had the opportunity of developing his intelligence.
('70', 257, 4, 20, 509461) This is not to say that a labourer who has never learnt English is devoid of intelligence.
('70', 257, 4, 21, 509552) Unfortunately labour has never been helped to develop the mind, and those who pass through schools do have their minds opened even though under a handicap not to be
('70', 257, 5, 22, 509717) 1 Vide “Discussion with John R. Mott”, 13/14 11 1936

('70', 258, 1, 2, 509819) found in any other part of the world.
('70', 258, 1, 3, 509857) Even this mental equipment is counter balanced by false notions of dignity inculcated during school and college days.
('70', 258, 1, 4, 509975) And so students think that they can earn their living only at the desk.
('70', 258, 1, 5, 510047) The inquirer has therefore to realize the dignity of labour and seek the maintenance of himself and his family in that field.
('70', 258, 1, 6, 510173) And there is no reason why his wife should not add to the family income by utilizing her spare hours.
('70', 258, 1, 7, 510275) Similarly if the children are at all able to do any work, they too should be inspanned for productive work.
('70', 258, 1, 8, 510383) The utterly false idea that intelligence can be developed only through book reading should give place to the truth that the quickest development of the mind can be achieved by artisan’s work being learnt in a scientific manner.
('70', 258, 1, 9, 510611) True development of the mind commences immediately the apprentice is taught at every step why a particular manipulation of the hand or a tool is required.
('70', 258, 1, 10, 510766) The problem of the unemployment of students can be solved without difficulty if they will rank themselves among the common labourers.
('70', 258, 1, 11, 510900) As for marriage against one’s will, all I can say is that students should develop sufficient strength of purpose to resist any marriage that is sought to be forced on them.
('70', 258, 1, 12, 511073) Students should learn the art of standing alone and resisting in every legitimate manner any attempt to force them to do anything against their will much more so to marry against their will.

('70', 258, 6, 20, 511541) The weather here is good—but not so bracing as at Segaon.

('70', 259, 3, 4, 511854) MIRA, I must rest the right hand.
('70', 259, 3, 5, 511888) No time left here for much writing.
('70', 259, 3, 6, 511924) I hope you are now quite well and happy in mind.
('70', 259, 3, 7, 511973) There was a basket of fruit lying in Maganwadi when I reached there.

('70', 259, 11, 24, 512803) If Sikhism is not part and product of Hinduism you are simply creating a conflict among the Harijans without achieving any noble purpose.

('70', 260, 2, 3, 513094) [Before January 10, 1937] 2
('70', 260, 3, 4, 513122) GANDHIJI: Passive resistance is a misnomer for non violent resis tance.
('70', 260, 3, 5, 513194) It is much more active than violent resistance.
('70', 260, 3, 6, 513242) It is direct, ceaseless, but three fourths invisible and only one fourth visible.
('70', 260, 3, 7, 513324) In its visibility it seems to be ineffective, e.g., the spinning wheel which I have called the symbol of non violence.
('70', 260, 3, 8, 513443) In its visibility it appears ineffective, but it is really intensely active and most effective in ultimate result.
('70', 260, 3, 9, 513558) This knowledge enables me to detect flaws in the way in which the votaries of non violence are doing their spinning.
('70', 260, 3, 10, 513675) I ask for more vigilance and more untiredness.
('70', 260, 3, 11, 513722) Non violence is an intensely active force when properly understood and used.
('70', 260, 3, 12, 513799) A violent man’s activity is most visible while it lasts.
('70', 260, 3, 13, 513856) But it is always transitory.
('70', 260, 3, 14, 513885) What can be more visible than the Abyssinians done to death by Italians?
('70', 260, 3, 15, 513958) There it was lesser violence pitted against much greater.
('70', 260, 3, 16, 514016) But if the Abyssinians had retired from the field and allowed themselves to be slaughtered, their seeming inactivity would have been much more effective though not for the moment visible.
('70', 260, 3, 17, 514204) Hitler and Mussolini on the one hand and Stalin on the other are able to show the immediate effectiveness of violence.
('70', 260, 3, 18, 514323) But it will be as transitory as that of Jhenghis’s slaughter.
('70', 260, 3, 19, 514385) But the effects of Buddha’s non violent action persist and are likely to grow with age.
('70', 260, 3, 20, 514473) And the more it is practised, the more effective and inexhaustible it becomes, and ultimately the whole world stands agape and exclaims, ‘a miracle has happened’.
('70', 260, 3, 21, 514636) All miracles are due to the silent and effective working of invisible forces.
('70', 260, 3, 22, 514714) Non violence is the most invisible and the most effective.
('70', 260, 4, 23, 514773) MAYS: I have no doubt in my mind about the superiority of non violence but the thing that bothers me is about its exercise on a large scale, the difficulty of so disciplining the mass mind on the point of love.
('70', 260, 4, 24, 514984) It is easier to discipline individuals.
('70', 260, 4, 25, 515024) What should be the strategy when they break out?
('70', 260, 4, 26, 515073) Do we retreat or do we go on?
('70', 260, 5, 27, 515103) GANDHIJI: I have had that experience in the course of our movement here.
('70', 260, 5, 28, 515176) Pepole do not gain the training by preaching.
('70', 260, 6, 29, 515222) 1 Extracted from Mahadev Desai’s “A Discourse on Non violence”.
('70', 260, 6, 30, 515286) Mays was an American Negro who had come to India along with Dr. Tobias to attend the World’s Meeting of the Committees of Y.M.C.A. 2 According to Mahadev Desai, this interview took place before the meeting with Dr. Tobias; vide “Interview to Dr. Tobias”, 10 1 1937
('70', 261, 0, 1, 515551) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 262
('70', 261, 1, 2, 515593) violence cannot be preached.
('70', 261, 1, 3, 515622) It has to be practised.
('70', 261, 1, 4, 515646) The practice of violence can be taught to people by outward symbols.
('70', 261, 1, 5, 515715) You shoot at boards, then at targets, then at beasts.
('70', 261, 1, 6, 515769) Then you are passed as an expert in the art of destruction.
('70', 261, 1, 7, 515829) The non violent man has no outward weapon and, therefore, not only his speech but his action also seems ineffective.
('70', 261, 1, 8, 515946) I may say all kinds of sweet words to you without meaning them.
('70', 261, 1, 9, 516010) On the other hand I may have real love in me and yet my outward expression may be forbidding.
('70', 261, 1, 10, 516104) Then outwardly my action in both cases may be the same and yet the effect may be different.
('70', 261, 1, 11, 516196) For the effect of our action is often more potent when it is not patently known.
('70', 261, 1, 12, 516277) Thus the unconscious effect you are making on me I may never know.
('70', 261, 1, 13, 516344) It is, nevertheless, infinitely greater than the conscious effect.
('70', 261, 1, 14, 516411) In violence there is nothing invisible.
('70', 261, 1, 15, 516451) Non violence, on the other hand, is three fourths invisible, so the effect is in the inverse ratio to its invisibility.
('70', 261, 1, 16, 516571) Non violence, when it becomes active, travels with extraordinary velocity, and then it becomes a miracle.
('70', 261, 1, 17, 516677) So the mass mind is affected first unconsciously, then consciously.
('70', 261, 1, 18, 516745) When it becomes consciously affected there is demostrable victory.
('70', 261, 1, 19, 516812) In my own experience, when people seemed to be weakening there was no consciousness of defeat in me.
('70', 261, 1, 20, 516913) Thus I was fuller of hope in the efficacy of non violence after the renunciation of Civil Disobedience in 1922, and today I continue to be in the same hopeful mood.
('70', 261, 1, 21, 517078) It is not a mere emotional thing.
('70', 261, 1, 22, 517112) Supposing I saw no signs of dawn coming I should not lose faith.
('70', 261, 1, 23, 517177) Everything has to come in its proper time.
('70', 261, 1, 24, 517220) I have discussions here with my co workers about the scavenging work we are doing.
('70', 261, 1, 25, 517303) ‘Why can’t we do it after swaraj?
('70', 261, 1, 26, 517337) they say.
('70', 261, 1, 27, 517347) ‘We may do it better after swaraj’.
('70', 261, 1, 28, 517383) I say to them, ‘No.
('70', 261, 1, 29, 517403) The reform has to come today, it must not wait for swaraj; in fact the right type of swaraj will come only out of such work.’ Now I cannot show you, as perhaps I cannot show some of my co workers, the connection between swaraj and scavenging.
('70', 261, 1, 30, 517646) If I have to win swaraj non violently I must discipline my people.
('70', 261, 1, 31, 517713) The maimed and the blind and the leprous cannot join the army of violence.
('70', 261, 1, 32, 517788) There is also an age limit for serving in the army.
('70', 261, 1, 33, 517840) For a non violent struggle there is no age limit; the blind and the maimed and the bed ridden may serve, and not only men but women also.
('70', 261, 1, 34, 517978) When the spirit of non violence pervades the people and actually begins to work, its effect is visible to all.
('70', 261, 1, 35, 518089) But now comes your poser.
('70', 261, 1, 36, 518115) There are people, you say, who do not believe in non violence as you do.
('70', 261, 1, 37, 518188) Are you to sit quiet?
('70', 262, 0, 1, 518210) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 263
('70', 262, 1, 2, 518259) friends ask: ‘If not now, when will you act?’ I say in reply: “I may not succeed in my lifetime, but my faith that victory can only come through non violence is stronger than ever.
('70', 262, 1, 3, 518440) When I spoke on the cult of the spinning wheel at Faizpur, a newspaper correspondent imputed astuteness to me.
('70', 262, 1, 4, 518551) Nothing could be further from my mind.
('70', 262, 1, 5, 518590) When I came to Segaon I was told the people might not co operate and might even boycott me.
('70', 262, 1, 6, 518682) I said: ‘That may be.
('70', 262, 1, 7, 518704) But this is the way non violence works.
('70', 262, 1, 8, 518744) If I go to a village which is still farther off, the experiment may work better.
('70', 262, 1, 9, 518825) This thing has come in my search after the technique of non violence.
('70', 262, 1, 10, 518895) And each day that passes makes my faith brighter.
('70', 262, 1, 11, 518945) I have come here to bring that faith to fruition and to die in the process if that is God’s will.
('70', 262, 1, 12, 519043) Non violence to be worth anything has to work in the face of hostile forces.
('70', 262, 1, 13, 519120) But there may be action in inaction.
('70', 262, 1, 14, 519157) And action may be worse than inaction.
('70', 262, 2, 15, 519196) MAYS: Is it ever possible to administer violence in a spirit of love?
('70', 262, 3, 16, 519266) I shall give you an illustration from my own experiment.
('70', 262, 3, 17, 519323) A calf was lame and had developed terrible sores; he could not eat and breathed with difficulty.
('70', 262, 3, 18, 519420) After three days’ argument with myself and my co workers I put an end to its life.
('70', 262, 3, 19, 519503) 1 Now that action was non violent because it was wholly unselfish, inasmuch as the sole purpose was to achieve the calf’s relief from pain.
('70', 262, 3, 20, 519643) Some people have called this an act of violence.
('70', 262, 3, 21, 519692) I have called it a surgical operation.
('70', 262, 3, 22, 519731) I should do exactly the same thing with my child, if he were in the same predicament.
('70', 262, 3, 23, 519817) My point is that non violence as the supreme law of our being ceases to be such the moment you talk of exceptions.
('70', 262, 4, 24, 519932) MAYS: How is a minority to act against an overwhelming majority?
('70', 262, 5, 25, 519997) G. I would say that a minority can do much more in the way of non violence then a majority.
('70', 262, 5, 26, 520089) I had an English friend called Symonds.
('70', 262, 5, 27, 520129) He used to say: ‘I am with you so long as you are in a minority.
('70', 262, 5, 28, 520194) After you are in a majority we are quits.’ I had less diffidence in handling my minority in South Africa than I had here in handling a majority.
('70', 262, 5, 29, 520339) But it would be wholly wrong therefore to say that non violence is a weapon of the weak.
('70', 262, 5, 30, 520428) The use of non violence requires greater bravery than that of violence.
('70', 262, 5, 31, 520500) When Daniel defied the laws of the Meads and Persians, his action was non violent.
('70', 262, 6, 32, 520583) 1 For a fuller account of the episode, vide “The Fiery Ordeal”, 4 10 1928
('70', 263, 0, 1, 520657) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 264
('70', 263, 1, 2, 520699) MAYS: Should the thought of consequences that might accrue to the enemy as a result of your non violence at all constrain you?
('70', 263, 2, 3, 520826) G. Certainly.
('70', 263, 2, 4, 520840) You may have to suspend your movement as I did in South Africa when the Government was faced with the revolt of European labour.
('70', 263, 2, 5, 520969) The latter asked me to make common cause with them.
('70', 263, 2, 6, 521021) I said ‘no’.
('70', 263, 3, 7, 521034) MAYS: And non violence will never rebound on you, whereas violence will be self destroyed?
('70', 263, 3, 8, 521125) G. Yes.
('70', 263, 3, 9, 521133) Violence must beget violence.
('70', 263, 3, 10, 521163) But let me tell you that here too my argument has been countered by a great man who said: ‘Look at the history on non violence.
('70', 263, 3, 11, 521291) Jesus died on the Cross, but his followers shed blood.’ This proves nothing.
('70', 263, 3, 12, 521368) We have no data before us to pass judgement.
('70', 263, 3, 13, 521413) We do not know the whole of the life of Jesus.
('70', 263, 3, 14, 521460) The followers perhaps had not imbibed fully the message of non violence.
('70', 263, 3, 15, 521533) But I must warn you against carrying the impression with you that mine is the final word on non violence.
('70', 263, 3, 16, 521639) I know my own limitations.
('70', 263, 3, 17, 521666) I am but a humble seeker after truth.
('70', 263, 3, 18, 521704) And all I claim is that every experiment of mine has deepened my faith in non violence as the greatest force at the disposal of mankind.
('70', 263, 3, 19, 521841) Its use is not restricted to individuals merely but it can be practised on a mass scale.
('70', 263, 4, 20, 521930) Harijan, 20 3 1937
('70', 263, 5, 21, 521949) 299. THE NEXT CONGRESS SESSION
('70', 263, 6, 22, 521980) Perhaps at the moment it is too early and not proper to write anything about the next Congress session.
('70', 263, 6, 23, 522084) This, however, holds good only if one wishes to write about political matters; that is because politics is constantly changing.
('70', 263, 6, 24, 522212) But I wish to write about the manner in which a rural session of the Congress should be held.
('70', 263, 6, 25, 522306) That is a subject which may be discussed at any time, and preparations should begin from today.
('70', 263, 6, 26, 522402) There is no doubt that the success of the Faizpur Congress has surpassed everyone’s expectations.
('70', 263, 6, 27, 522500) Despite this, the unavoidable drawbacks from which it suffered should and can be remedied in the future.
('70', 263, 6, 28, 522605) No one can be held reponsible for some of the things which were found at Faizpur.
('70', 263, 6, 29, 522687) No one had expected people would come in such large numbers.
('70', 263, 6, 30, 522748) At no other session of the Congress were volunteers made to work as hard as at this session.
('70', 263, 6, 31, 522841) Hence, it may be said that at Faizpur, the ship of the Congress had to be steered through an uncharted sea.
('70', 263, 6, 32, 522949) I give below a few improvements which I feel are necessary as a result of my experiences at Faizpur.
('70', 264, 0, 1, 523050) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 265
('70', 264, 1, 2, 523099) 1. It does not matter how small the village is.
('70', 264, 1, 3, 523147) It should not be more than seven miles from the nearest railway station.
('70', 264, 1, 4, 523220) 2. The necessary site should be obtained free.
('70', 264, 1, 5, 523267) 3. The village must co operate.
('70', 264, 1, 6, 523299) 4. The soil should not be black as at Faizpur, but sandy, capable of soaking up water quickly.
('70', 264, 1, 7, 523394) 5. Water should be provided in sufficient quantity and at various places.
('70', 264, 1, 8, 523468) 6. There should be an adequate number of latrines and urinals at various convenient spots.
('70', 264, 1, 9, 523559) 7. At various places, posters in Gujarati, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu and other languages, written in a bold hand, should be put up, saying: “Please use for latrines and urinals only the places provided”.
('70', 264, 1, 10, 523764) The roads should bear names or numbers, preferably the latter.
('70', 264, 1, 11, 523827) Bhangi volunteers should be in attendance on all the roads.
('70', 264, 1, 12, 523887) They should have a map of the Congress Nagar and should constantly guide the visitors.
('70', 264, 1, 13, 523974) They should also have brooms, buckets and small shovels.
('70', 264, 1, 14, 524031) If anyone urinates or defecates outside the urinals or latrines these volunteers should warn him, and remove the filth immediately and dispose of it.
('70', 264, 1, 15, 524181) A Bhangi should be in attendance at each urinal and latrine, whose duty should be to clean these up after they have been used.
('70', 264, 1, 16, 524308) Buckets and shovels made of tin may serve the purpose.
('70', 264, 1, 17, 524363) These are inexpensive and may be used even later.
('70', 264, 1, 18, 524413) If shovels are shaped like winnows they would be cheap and easy to use.
('70', 264, 1, 19, 524485) 8. There must be a good and well built hospital attached to the Congress Nagar.
('70', 264, 1, 20, 524565) It is necessary that it should have walls of unbaked bricks and a tiled roof.
('70', 264, 1, 21, 524643) It should accommodate at least twenty beds with a separate wing for women.
('70', 264, 1, 22, 524718) 9. There should not be one but several kitchens.
('70', 264, 1, 23, 524767) Things should become much easier if selected cooks are engaged.
('70', 264, 1, 24, 524831) It would facilitate matters to have blocks which would accommodate a hundred persons each for meals.
('70', 264, 1, 25, 524932) There should be separate charges for those who have their meals in the blocks and those who prefer to carry their meals away.
('70', 264, 1, 26, 525058) The menu should be simple and such as to suit all the provinces.
('70', 264, 1, 27, 525123) It is necessary to abandon the temptation to serve meals to a large number of people in one place.
('70', 264, 1, 28, 525222) Everyone must have his meal served in his own utensils.
('70', 264, 1, 29, 525278) It is never possible to make arrangements for serving thousands of people at any one place at the same time.
('70', 265, 0, 1, 525387) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 266
('70', 265, 1, 2, 525429) 10. At Faizpur, it was practically impossible to procure cow’s milk and cow’s ghee.
('70', 265, 1, 3, 525513) I think that even from the economic point of view, at Congress gatherings, if not elsewhere , we must make it a rule to use only cow’s milk.
('70', 265, 1, 4, 525654) It is no simple matter to provide cow’s milk to thousands of persons.
('70', 265, 1, 5, 525724) This task can be accomplished if preparations are taken in hand right from today.
('70', 265, 1, 6, 525806) 11. Flour, rice, etc., must be ground and pounded in the Congress Nagar itself.
('70', 265, 1, 7, 525886) 12. The Faizpur exhibition, to my mind, was the best held so far.
('70', 265, 1, 8, 525952) Its success was clearly evident and yet there is scope for improvement.
('70', 265, 1, 9, 526024) These are the principal points which occur to me at the moment.
('70', 265, 1, 10, 526088) Two changes seem to be necessary.
('70', 265, 1, 11, 526122) Under the new constitution, the Working Committee and the A.I.C.C. meet before the Congress session.
('70', 265, 1, 12, 526223) Taking advantage of this, other meetings are also held before the opening session of the Congress.
('70', 265, 1, 13, 526322) This is not proper.
('70', 265, 1, 14, 526342) It puts an unnecessary burden on the Reception Committee and lengthens the period of the session from three to ten days.
('70', 265, 1, 15, 526463) Either all meetings before the Congress session should be stopped or preparations should be made beforehand for a rush of people lasting ten days.
('70', 265, 1, 16, 526610) And if the Congress is to meet in a village only, it should not meet in December.
('70', 265, 1, 17, 526692) There is very little substance in the plea that the Congress session must be held towards the end of December because railway fare concessions are available during Christmas week and the Assembly has a holiday.
('70', 265, 1, 18, 526903) There is a much stronger case for holding the Congress session after the winter is over, for it suits the convenience of the lakhs of people who attend it.
('70', 265, 1, 19, 527059) I feel that the inconvenience suffered by people in winter, farmers being busy with the harvest in December and the difficulty of getting a large area of open ground on account of the standing crops are three difficulties which cancel out the two advantages.
('70', 265, 1, 20, 527318) I believe that the number of persons who came to Faizpur on foot from surrounding areas far exceeded the number who spent money on railway fare to come there.
('70', 265, 1, 21, 527477) Religious fairs such as Kumbh, Magh, etc., are not regulated by such considerations as railway fare concessions.
('70', 265, 1, 22, 527590) Regardless of whether these are available or not, these fairs are held at the appointed time and are attended by millions.
('70', 265, 1, 23, 527713) The Congress session should not be a lesser attraction than these.

('70', 266, 1, 2, 527870) 300. VAGUE LANGUAGE
('70', 266, 2, 3, 527890) A gentleman who is a careful reader of Harijanbandhu likes my article “Hindu Code of Conduct” 1 in its issue of December 27, but he is not satisfied with clause 14 therein.
('70', 266, 2, 4, 528063) That clause is as follows:
('70', 266, 3, 5, 528090) We certainly would not like anyone to abuse us or beat us or misbehave with our mother or sisters.
('70', 266, 3, 6, 528189) Hence, we should not abuse anyone, not even our wives and children.
('70', 266, 3, 7, 528257) Many of the clauses of this article are interrelated.
('70', 266, 3, 8, 528311) Clause 14 has a bearing on clauses 15, 16 and 17. If read along with these clauses the implication of clause 14 becomes clear.
('70', 266, 3, 9, 528438) Despite this, I must admit that one is likely to get confused if one reads clause 14 by itself.
('70', 266, 3, 10, 528534) I regard its language as vague and inelegant.
('70', 266, 3, 11, 528580) On rereading it I find that its clarity of meaning is lost because I have overburdened it.
('70', 266, 3, 12, 528671) Clauses 15, 16 and 17 have been written to clarify what is contained in clause 14. In order to relieve the burden on clause 14 and for the sake of clarity of thought and language, I write clauses 14, 15 and 17 as follows.
('70', 266, 3, 13, 528893) There is no scope for improvement in clause 16. 14. If anyone abused us or beat us, we would not like it.
('70', 266, 3, 14, 528999) Why then should we abuse others or beat them?
('70', 266, 3, 15, 529045) 15. We cannot abuse our wives and children if we do not abuse others.
('70', 266, 3, 16, 529115) Many men regard their wives and children as their property.
('70', 266, 3, 17, 529175) This is a grave error.
('70', 266, 3, 18, 529198) In our religion, the wife has been regarded as the equal of the husband.
('70', 266, 3, 19, 529271) It is for this reason that she is known as ardhangini and also as sahadharmini.
('70', 266, 3, 20, 529351) She is addressed as devi.
('70', 266, 3, 21, 529377) 2 Parents are the protectors of the children.
('70', 266, 3, 22, 529423) Hence they should be gentle, tolerant, and patient towards them also.
('70', 266, 3, 23, 529493) 17. We shall not tolerate anyone misbehaving with our wife or mother or sister.
('70', 266, 3, 24, 529573) How then can we misbehave with anyone else’s wife?
('70', 266, 3, 25, 529624) To cast a lustful glance at a woman, to pass obscene remarks about her, to touch her with wicked intention—all this would be regarded as misconduct.
('70', 266, 3, 26, 529773) All women except one’s wife are one’s mothers and sisters.

('70', 267, 4, 4, 530016) Your two letters came together.
('70', 267, 4, 5, 530048) They were enough to make me weep.
('70', 267, 4, 6, 530082) How can I console you?
('70', 267, 4, 7, 530105) If you cannot have your peace there you can certainly go to Varoda or Wardha and pass the few days usefully.
('70', 267, 4, 8, 530214) I have no other Manager to appoint.
('70', 267, 4, 9, 530250) I have to be satisfied with Munnalal so long as I consider him to be a clean man.
('70', 267, 4, 10, 530332) The noise is there in my absence but no more than is observable in an Indian home.
('70', 267, 4, 11, 530415) You can remedy these things, if you can be calm within and treat these noises as also abuses to be remedied.
('70', 267, 4, 12, 530524) We do not become impatient over ravings of maniacs.
('70', 267, 4, 13, 530576) For we treat them as diseases to be tolerated till they are remedied.
('70', 267, 4, 14, 530646) Why can’t you treat the aberrations of the Segaon home in exactly the same light?
('70', 267, 4, 15, 530728) I am, I hope, not leaving Segaon again quite so soon.
('70', 267, 4, 16, 530782) Belgaum is there.

('70', 267, 9, 26, 531096) His remedies are not inhuman, but are such as the poor can afford and tolerate.
('70', 267, 9, 27, 531176) I would advise you to consult him for Durga.
('70', 267, 9, 28, 531221) We may not carry out his treatment if we don’t want to.
('70', 267, 9, 29, 531277) The remedies prescribed by Mehta and Gaurishankar are royal.
('70', 267, 9, 30, 531338) This is a hakim for the poor and a godly man.

('70', 268, 2, 4, 531589) [January 10, 1937] 2
('70', 268, 3, 5, 531610) TOBIAS: Your doctrine of non violence has profoundly influenced my life.
('70', 268, 3, 6, 531683) Do you believe in it as strongly as ever?
('70', 268, 4, 7, 531725) GANDHIJI: I do indeed.
('70', 268, 4, 8, 531748) My faith in it is growing.
('70', 268, 5, 9, 531775) Negroes in U.S.A. —12 million—are struggling to obtain such fundamental rights as freedom from mob violence, unrestricted use of the ballot, freedom from segregation, etc.
('70', 268, 5, 10, 531947) Have you, out of your struggle in India, a word of advice and encouragement to give us?
('70', 268, 5, 11, 532035) I had to contend against some such thing, though on a much smaller scale, in South Africa.
('70', 268, 5, 12, 532126) The difficulties are not yet over.
('70', 268, 5, 13, 532161) All I can say is that there is no other way than the way of non violence, a way, however, not of the weak and ignorant but of the strong and wise.
('70', 268, 6, 14, 532308) Travancore indicates that your full identification with the untouchables is bearing fruit.
('70', 268, 6, 15, 532399) 3 Do you think Travancore’s example will be followed by other States in the near future?
('70', 268, 6, 16, 532488) I shall be surprised if it is not.
('70', 268, 7, 17, 532523) What word shall I give my Negro brethren as to the outlook for the future?
('70', 268, 7, 18, 532598) With right which is on their side and the choice of non violence as their only weapon, if they will make it such, a bright future is assured.

('70', 269, 5, 14, 534206) You seem to have become careless as ever about your health.

('70', 271, 4, 7, 536979) January 12, 1937
('70', 271, 5, 8, 536996) As you have in your address very properly said, this is not my first visit to Travancore or its capital Trivandrum.
('70', 271, 5, 9, 537112) Every time I have come to Travancore, I have come almost as a crusader trying to wean savarna Hindus from the curse of untouchability.
('70', 271, 5, 10, 537247) I have had many occasions to address savarna Hindus and avarna Hindus, miscalled untouchables or depressed classes, also on this subject.
('70', 271, 5, 11, 537385) This time, however, I have come as a humble pilgrim to tender my congra tulations to H.H. the Maharaja and his good mother Her Highness the Maharani and his able Dewan.
('70', 271, 5, 12, 537554) With the co operation of this trinity, if I might so describe the distinguished persons, the great Proclamation has been a settled fact and has now been working with success.
('70', 271, 5, 13, 537729) The temples have been sealed to me so far, perhaps voluntarily, and I do not know that if I had made the attempt to enter them I should not have been thrown out of them.
('70', 271, 5, 14, 537899) But even if I had the liberty, having made common cause with the Harijans I could not avail myself of it.
('70', 271, 5, 15, 538005) But now that the doors have been flung open to the Harijans also, I shall for the first time take the opportunity of entering your beautiful temple.
('70', 271, 5, 16, 538154) I take your address as a token of your goodwill.
('70', 271, 5, 17, 538203) I shall have several occasions to speak on the great act of the Maharaja, and I shall therefore refrain from making anything like a speech here.
('70', 271, 5, 18, 538348) This Proclamation throws a tremendous responsibility on the people of Travancore.
('70', 271, 5, 19, 538430) Rajas and Maharajas can make good laws, but they cannot make the people give proper effect to them.
('70', 271, 5, 20, 538530) Even tyrants cannot control the hearts of those over whom they hold sway.
('70', 271, 5, 21, 538604) It all depends on your hearts to give proper effect to the Proclamation.
('70', 271, 5, 22, 538677) I would ask you to go to the temples not as curiosity mongers, but in a proper prayerful spirit.
('70', 271, 5, 23, 538774) If savarnas go there with mental reservations, the Proclamation will not be properly carried out.

('70', 272, 4, 8, 539481) January 13, 1937
('70', 272, 5, 9, 539498) I am glad to have been asked to distribute the certificates and prizes to those who have passed the examination.
('70', 272, 5, 10, 539611) I do not know whether you will follow even my simple Hindi.
('70', 272, 5, 11, 539671) I see that some of those who have received their certificates today do not follow it.
('70', 272, 5, 12, 539757) But that is nothing to be ashamed of.
('70', 272, 5, 13, 539795) Not living in the midst of a Hindi speaking public, it is quite natural that you should find it difficult to follow spoken Hindi.
('70', 272, 5, 14, 539925) What is gratifying is that you are taking some pains over learning Hindi in this Southernmost part of India.
('70', 272, 5, 15, 540034) But please remember that your objective is not to win certificates but to obtain a working knowledge of Hindi.
('70', 272, 5, 16, 540145) A certificate can but stimulate you to further effort, in order that you may be induced to put up a serious endeavour for an ever increasing knowledge of Hindi.
('70', 272, 5, 17, 540306) The first thing that you have to bear in mind is that you belong to India, that India is as much your motherland as of those whose mother tongue is Hindi.
('70', 272, 5, 18, 540461) You have therefore to think of your country not as extending up to a part of the Arabian sea in the west and to the Ghats on the east but to the Hindukush in the north, Karachi in the west and Assam in the east.
('70', 272, 5, 19, 540673) If you went to those remote parts of your country where other languages are spoken, what would you speak there but Hindi?
('70', 272, 5, 20, 540795) You will not find many people capable of understanding English.
('70', 272, 5, 21, 540859) The temple priest in the great Ananthapadmanabha temple here was speaking perfect Hindi this morning when I was shown over by him through the precincts of that vast temple.
('70', 272, 5, 22, 541032) His Hindi was certainly more flawless than mine and he made me forget for a moment that I was in Travancore.
('70', 272, 5, 23, 541141) The uppermost feeling in my mind is not that I am a Gujarati but that I belong to the whole of India.

('70', 273, 1, 2, 541285) I would appeal to H.H. the Maharaja and Her Highness the Maharani to promote the development of Hindi studies in Travancore and encourage those who are going in for the study of Hindi.
('70', 273, 1, 3, 541470) Let the objective of Travancore be to make every literate man and woman here Hindi knowing.

('70', 273, 4, 6, 541634) January 13, 1937
('70', 273, 5, 7, 541651) I wish I were able to speak to you in your own mother tongue.
('70', 273, 5, 8, 541713) I am sorry that I have not yet been able to learn the very musical language that you speak, and it is a matter of equal sorrow to me that you do not understand the national language of India—Hindi Hindustani.
('70', 273, 5, 9, 541922) Therefore we have to fall back on the cumbrous process of translation.
('70', 273, 5, 10, 541993) But it is inevitable if I am at all to reach your hearts somewhat.
('70', 273, 5, 11, 542060) I assure you I do not want to make here an idle speech, nor am I fond of hearing my own voice.
('70', 273, 5, 12, 542155) I know that silence is often better than speech.
('70', 273, 5, 13, 542204) But I know also from experience that there are occasions when speech becomes a necessity, and probably this is one of those occasions.
('70', 273, 5, 14, 542339) I thank you very much for having asked me to preside over this celebrations meeting.
('70', 273, 5, 15, 542424) I thank you also for presenting me with this address.
('70', 273, 5, 16, 542478) You have already tendered your hearty congratulations to His Highness the Maharaja and Maharani and Sachivottama Sir C.P. Ramaswami Iyer.
('70', 273, 5, 17, 542616) I want to associate myself fully with the expression of your joy and congratulations.
('70', 273, 5, 18, 542702) The joy is written on the numerous faces of this assembly over the restoration of a right which was taken away from you, no one knows how many years ago.
('70', 273, 5, 19, 542856) You have done well also in tracing the historical sequence of the agitation for opening all the temples to the avarna Hindus in Travancore, and I again associate myself with you in the praise you have bestowed upon His Holiness the late Narayanaguru Swami and also upon that brave soul Madhavan.
('70', 273, 5, 20, 543152) You will also let me recall in this connection two names—I mean the late Krishnaswami who at the time of the Vykom Satyagraha used to lead the prayer in his own inimitable manner with recitations of verses from Gita Govinda.
('70', 273, 5, 21, 543377) Though a staunch Brahmin and lover of his religion, he made common cause with all the avarnas.
('70', 273, 5, 22, 543472) And I may not forget also one who is still in our midst—Sjt.

('70', 274, 0, 1, 543548) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 275
('70', 274, 1, 2, 543597) These brave men laid the foundation of the thing we see today in our midst.
('70', 274, 2, 3, 543673) But I think that we may not forget the orthodoxy which has come to our assistance at this hour, and in this connection I suppose I may not omit to mention the Namboodiri orthodox people whom I had found to my great regret very difficult to convert to the obvious truth.
('70', 274, 2, 4, 543943) If they and the other orthodox people had not recognized the spirit of the times, it might be that they would have rendered the task of their Highnesses well nigh impossible or, at least, ineffective.
('70', 274, 2, 5, 544144) In this connection let me recall also a meeting I had with the Senior Maharani years ago.
('70', 274, 2, 6, 544234) That meeting took place when the Vykom Satyagraha was going on, and I appealed to her, with all the earnestness at my command, to come to the assistance of all those who were fighting a forlorn battle, to issue a new Smriti and to declare all the temples open.
('70', 274, 2, 7, 544495) She and her husband, who was present at the interview, expressed their sympathy with this movement.
('70', 274, 2, 8, 544595) They both welcomed the movement that was going on in Travancore for the liberation of avarnas.
('70', 274, 2, 9, 544690) But they felt burdened with the responsibility of a great State and told me that the time had not come for taking that great step.
('70', 274, 2, 10, 544821) She than thought that it was still necessary to sound savarna opinion and to convert it to the reform.
('70', 274, 2, 11, 544924) Several years have passed by since that interview.
('70', 274, 2, 12, 544975) Thanks be to God that you did not remain idle during all these years, and but for the sustained efforts on your part to arouse both avarna and savarna public opinion, even the Maharaja with all the goodwill in the world would have found it impossible to issue the Proclamation.
('70', 274, 2, 13, 545253) I hope that the Senior Maharani is today rejoicing over the great change that has come over Travancore and over the fact that the Proclamation is being welcomed by all and sundry—both avarnas and savarnas.
('70', 274, 2, 14, 545459) I am hoping also that with the incoming of this great change over the State of Travancore the savarna Hindus are as enthusiastic in visiting temples as the avarna Hindus.
('70', 274, 2, 15, 545630) I want to tell all savarnas, men and women, who have from day to day gone to these temples in search of blessings and in the hope that their prayers will be answered; I want to assure them that the temples have gained in efficacy and not lost one whit from the efficacy they enjoyed.
('70', 274, 2, 16, 545914) Our Shastras teach us—I am not giving you any new truth—that efficacy lies in our hearts, not in stone however well carved it may be, and I do hope that your faith will not fail you because a large part of your co religionists have had an ancient right
('70', 275, 0, 1, 546167) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 276
('70', 275, 1, 2, 546209) restored to them of offering their prayers in the same manner and on the same conditions as you have offered them.
('70', 275, 1, 3, 546324) I would like to mention one sorrow that has oppressed me ever since I came here.
('70', 275, 1, 4, 546405) I have wondered why you have called this celebration Ezhava Temple entry Proclamation Celebrations.
('70', 275, 1, 5, 546505) I wonder if presently we shall have All Travancore Pulaya and Pariah Celebrations!
('70', 275, 1, 6, 546588) I know and I grant that Ezhavas are a great and growing and important community in Travancore, but have I not seen the Pulayas and Pariahs of Travancore?
('70', 275, 1, 7, 546742) When I have met them I have not been able to stare them straight in their faces.
('70', 275, 1, 8, 546823) I have felt deeply humiliated.
('70', 275, 1, 9, 546854) I shall never forget the sight of an old Pulaya man shaking with fear, as he was brought to me, and as he tried to hand me a sheet of paper which had been put into his hands.
('70', 275, 1, 10, 547029) He was brought to me in Cochin as I was passing through the crowds in the streets.
('70', 275, 1, 11, 547112) I was told that he held in his hand an address to be given me on behalf of the Pulayas.
('70', 275, 1, 12, 547200) His withered hands, as they were shaking, could not deliver that address in my hands.
('70', 275, 1, 13, 547286) There was no lustre in his eyes.
('70', 275, 1, 14, 547319) I do not know that I saw even a ray of hope in those deep sunken eyes.
('70', 275, 1, 15, 547390) He did not know what he was being called upon to do.
('70', 275, 1, 16, 547443) I do not know that he could understand the choice Malayalam which the Namboodiri volunteer was speaking.
('70', 275, 1, 17, 547548) I seized the situation at a glance.
('70', 275, 1, 18, 547584) I hung my head in shame and sorrow, and I felt it my duty to snatch that precious paper from his hands.
('70', 275, 1, 19, 547688) Why is he not a member of today’s Celebration Committee?
('70', 275, 1, 20, 547745) I know that he is nameless.
('70', 275, 1, 21, 547773) Most probably he is dead.
('70', 275, 1, 22, 547799) If he is alive perhaps he does not know what is happening in Travancore today.
('70', 275, 1, 23, 547878) And also I asked myself whether you members of this Celebration Committee, you members of this vast gathering, do or do not represent such men.
('70', 275, 1, 24, 548022) And I must tell you with all respect and humility that if this vast assembly does not represent these Pulayas, then I am certain that there is no place in your midst for me.
('70', 275, 1, 25, 548196) If this is a purely religious movement, if this is a purely religious revival, if it has no taint of base ‘self’ in it, then you will be denying yourselves and nullifying the effect of this great Proclamation if you do not represent the lowest and the least in our midst.
('70', 275, 1, 26, 548468) You heard with what force Sir C.P. Ramaswami Iyer spoke to this meeting.
('70', 275, 1, 27, 548541) The Maharaja has given you a Smriti, but it is for you to carry it out and breathe life into it , and you will hopelessly fail to do that unless you rise to the occasion and see to it that this religious spirit pervades the whole of Travancore—both avarnas and savarnas.
('70', 275, 1, 28, 548812) I tell you if you approach this great step, each with his own mental
('70', 276, 0, 1, 548881) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 277
('70', 276, 1, 2, 548930) reservation, and not give effect to it whole heartedly, you will find this Proclamation a nine days’ wonder.
('70', 276, 1, 3, 549039) Therefore I want you to under stand, whilst you are properly rejoicing over this Proclamation and celebrating it with the joy and zeal that I see on your faces, that you will not be doing your duty if you do not realize your responsibility to the whole of the community that had been so far excluded.
('70', 276, 1, 4, 549340) I see that you are now getting restless.
('70', 276, 1, 5, 549381) I do not propose to keep you longer than is absolutely necessary .
('70', 276, 1, 6, 549448) I am speaking to you from the fulness of my heart, and when heart is speaking to hearts, it expects to find a lodgment in those hearts.
('70', 276, 1, 7, 549584) I do not want to keep you more than perhaps ten minutes now.
('70', 276, 1, 8, 549645) I shall try to omit many of the things I wanted to say this evening, and shall seek another occasion for doing so.
('70', 276, 1, 9, 549760) I must mention what I saw at the great Padmanabha Temple.
('70', 276, 1, 10, 549818) It will perhaps best illustrate what I am saying about the pure and spiritual revival.
('70', 276, 1, 11, 549905) In the days of my youth I went to so many temples with the faith and devotion with which my parents had fired me.
('70', 276, 1, 12, 550019) But of late years I have not been visiting temples, and ever since I have been engaged in anti untouchability work I have refrained from going to temples unless they were open to everyone called untouchable.
('70', 276, 1, 13, 550227) So what I saw this morning at the temple dawned upon me with the same newness with which it must have dawned upon so many avarna Hindus who must have gone to the temple after the Proclamation.
('70', 276, 1, 14, 550420) In imagination my mind travelled back to the prehistoric centuries when they began to convey the message of God in stone and metal.
('70', 276, 1, 15, 550552) I saw quite clearly that the priest who was interpreting each figure in his own choice Hindi did not want to tell me that each of those figures was God.
('70', 276, 1, 16, 550705) But without giving me that particular interpretation he made me realize that these temples were so many bridges between the Unseen, Invisible and Indefinable God and ourselves who are infinitesimal drops in the Infinite Ocean.
('70', 276, 1, 17, 550932) We the human family are not all philosophers.
('70', 276, 1, 18, 550978) We are of the earth very earthy, and we are not satisfied with contemplating the Invisible God.
('70', 276, 1, 19, 551074) Somehow or other we want something which we can touch, something which we can see, something before which we can kneel down.
('70', 276, 1, 20, 551199) It does not matter whether it is a book, or an empty stone building, or a stone building, inhabited by numerous figures.
('70', 276, 1, 21, 551320) A book will satisfy some, an empty building will satisfy some others, and many others will not be satisfied unless they see something inhabiting these empty buildings.
('70', 276, 1, 22, 551488) Then I ask you to approach these temples not as if they represented a
('70', 277, 0, 1, 551558) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 278
('70', 277, 1, 2, 551600) body of superstitions.
('70', 277, 1, 3, 551623) If you will approach these temples with faith in them, you will know each time you visit them you will come away from them purified, and with your faith more and more in the living God.
('70', 277, 1, 4, 551809) Anyway, I have looked upon this Proclamation as a pure religious act.
('70', 277, 1, 5, 551879) I have regarded this visit to Travancore in the spirit of a pilgrimage, and I am going to these temples as an untouchable suddenly made touchable.
('70', 277, 1, 6, 552026) If all of you will approach this Proclamation in this spirit, you will abolish all distinctions between savarnas and avarnas as also all those distinctions which unfortu nately still exist between avarnas and avarnas.
('70', 277, 1, 7, 552244) Finally you will not be satisfied until you have lifted up your brothers and sisters who are supposed to be the least and the lowest, to heights which you have attained yourselves.
('70', 277, 1, 8, 552425) True spiritual regeneration must include economic uplift and the removal of ignorance and everything that goes to retard human progress.
('70', 277, 1, 9, 552562) May God enable you to realize to the full the possibilities that are embedded in this Proclamation of the Maharaja.
('70', 277, 1, 10, 552678) I thank you for giving me this patient hearing.

('70', 277, 4, 13, 552774) January 14, 1937 1
('70', 277, 5, 14, 552793) I thank you for the three addresses you have read or partially read here.
('70', 277, 5, 15, 552867) I wish there was time to listen to all the addresses in full.
('70', 277, 5, 16, 552929) I have read the Hindi address in full and the second, which is really a report of the Harijan work, I promise to read in full.
('70', 277, 5, 17, 553056) Needless to say that I associate myself with you in your congratulations to the trinity responsible for the Proclamation over which Travancore is rejoicing, and I congratulate the savarnas of this place who unanimously and heartily endorsed the Proclamation.
('70', 277, 5, 18, 553315) Of course, it is open to the savarnas and avarnas to make the gracious Proclamation perfectly useless—the savarnas may be sullenly discontented and not purity their hearts of untouchability, and the avarnas can make it perfectly ineffective by misunderstanding the grace of the Proclamation and by not going to temples in the right spirit.

('70', 278, 1, 2, 553783) not going to temples in the right spirit.
('70', 278, 1, 3, 553825) The Maharaja, the Maharani and the Dewan have done their duty by issuing the Proclamation which has no reservation, mental or otherwise, behind it; and if both savarnas and avarnas prove by their real religious conduct that they were worthy of this high act of State, believe me Travancore will go down in history as the saviour of Hindu religion which was in danger of perishing.
('70', 278, 1, 4, 554206) For I have seen nothing during these long years of struggle against untouchability to modify my opinion that if untouchability lives Hinduism dies.
('70', 278, 1, 5, 554354) I wish I could infect all of you with the same belief and in every one of your acts you would show that the taint of untouchability has been removed from your hearts.

('70', 278, 4, 8, 554574) January 14, 1937
('70', 278, 5, 9, 554591) It gives me great pleasure to be in your midst and greater pleasure still to realize under what auspices I am touring Travancore today.
('70', 278, 5, 10, 554727) I have in mind the great Proclamation that has practically removed untouchability from Travancore.
('70', 278, 5, 11, 554826) I say “practically removed” because the Proclamation cannot do everything, although it has worked wonders.
('70', 278, 5, 12, 554933) To remove untouchability root and branch from this soil and, for that matter, from India, rests with you and me.
('70', 278, 5, 13, 555046) In Ayyan Kali, whom you half in jest and half in endearment call the Pulaya Rajah, you have an indefatigable worker.
('70', 278, 5, 14, 555163) I understand that under his leadership you have been making steady progress and I have no doubt that this gracious Proclamation will quicken the progress you are making.
('70', 278, 5, 15, 555333) I must not keep you or keep myself long as I have a heavy day in front of me.
('70', 278, 5, 16, 555411) If I had the time, I would love to pass a whole day with you and know many of you intimately.
('70', 278, 5, 17, 555505) As it is, I have to be satisfied with having seen your beaming faces and making such acquaintances as I can within the few minutes I have in your midst.
('70', 278, 5, 18, 555658) I would like to leave just one thought with you before I go.
('70', 278, 5, 19, 555719) I hope you will make a wise and religious use of this opportunity to go to the temples.
('70', 278, 5, 20, 555807) It depends upon our mental condition whether we gain something or do not gain anything by going to the temples.
('70', 278, 5, 21, 555919) We have to approach these temples in a humble penitent mood.
('70', 278, 5, 22, 555980) They are so many houses of God.
('70', 278, 5, 23, 556012) Of course God resides in every human form, indeed in every particle of His creation, in everything that is on

('70', 279, 1, 2, 556164) this earth.
('70', 279, 1, 3, 556176) But since we very fallible mortals do not appreciate the fact that God is everywhere, we impute special sanctity to temples and think that God resides there.
('70', 279, 1, 4, 556334) And so when we approach these temples we must cleanse our bodies, our minds and our hearts, and we should enter them in a prayerful mood and ask God to make us purer men and purer women for having entered their portals.
('70', 279, 1, 5, 556554) And if you will take this advice of an old man, this physical deliverance that you have secured will be a deliverance of the soul.

('70', 279, 4, 8, 556736) January 14, 1937
('70', 279, 5, 9, 556753) I thank you for the addresses, but I must remind you that they should be brief, to the point and written either in Hindi or in Malayalam.
('70', 279, 5, 10, 556891) Surely an address written in English cannot be understood by large masses of people whom we want to serve.
('70', 279, 5, 11, 556998) If they were written in Hindi, they could catch at least a few words common to both Hindi and Malayalam.
('70', 279, 5, 12, 557103) You will perhaps say that just as the masses do not understand English, neither do they understand Hindi.
('70', 279, 5, 13, 557209) But I tell you it does not come to the same thing.
('70', 279, 5, 14, 557260) Those who are innocent of English surely can pick up a few words of Hindi.
('70', 279, 5, 15, 557335) And then why should you enclose these addresses in hideous frames?
('70', 279, 5, 16, 557402) How am I to take all these home?
('70', 279, 5, 17, 557435) The glass is sure to be damaged, as indeed this one has been damaged and it has thus become a dangerous article to carry.
('70', 279, 5, 18, 557557) One word about the Proclamation which has brought me here.
('70', 279, 5, 19, 557616) I know that your presence here is a sign that you are sharing the celebrations going on in Travancore.
('70', 279, 5, 20, 557719) Every one of you should understand the significance of the Proclamation.
('70', 279, 5, 21, 557792) If all men and women here think or harbour untouchability in their hearts, they have not given effect to the Proclamation.
('70', 279, 5, 22, 557915) That Proclamation tells you— every man and woman and child—that henceforth there is no untouchability in Travancore, that in the sight of God and man, Nairs and Nambudiris, Ezhavas and Pulayas and Pariahs and what not are all equally children of God.
('70', 279, 5, 23, 558166) And when they get entrance to the Holy of Holies, naturally all other distinctions fall to the ground.
('70', 279, 5, 24, 558269) Therefore, those who are better off will take care to see that they will raise those who are worse off economically and socially.
('70', 279, 5, 25, 558399) And if you have flatte

('70', 280, 1, 3, 558610) But I know that even the savarnas have forgotten the art of worship.
('70', 280, 1, 4, 558679) However, now that the Proclamation has purified the atmosphere, you must learn the art and teach it to the avarnas.
('70', 280, 1, 5, 558795) I hope and pray that you will do so.

('70', 280, 4, 8, 558887) January 14, 1937 1
('70', 280, 5, 9, 558906) I was at this place not many years ago when the forbidding looking walls of this temple seemed to say, “not yet for you this place.” Nobody had thought some months ago that there would be a Proclamation of H.H. the Maharaja of Travancore and that all temples would be flung open to the untouchables.
('70', 280, 5, 10, 559206) The sins of past ages have been obliterated by literally a stroke of the pen.
('70', 280, 5, 11, 559284) Though it was the hand of the Maharaja that traced the signature over the Proclamation, the spirit behind it was that of the Lord Padmanabhaswami.
('70', 280, 5, 12, 559431) I understood only today the beautiful legend that passes current in Travancore about the Maharaja.
('70', 280, 5, 13, 559530) As you all know—I suppose every child in Travancore knows—that the Maharajas in Travancore are known as Padmanabhadas.
('70', 280, 5, 14, 559649) They are so many Viceroys of Padmanabhaswami, and as I understood yesterday the Maharaja has to go from day to day to that temple and receive instructions about the day’s work from Padmanabhaswami.
('70', 280, 5, 15, 559847) That the thing does not happen as I have described to you as between man and man is true, but the spirit behind the legend is an excellent spirit.
('70', 280, 5, 16, 559994) It means that the Maharaja may not do anything that is wrong or sinful and has not the stamp of God’s approval.
('70', 280, 5, 17, 560106) And so, as I said, it is the spirit of God that moved the Maharaja to take the great step he has taken and I wish to congratulate you who are the beneficiaries under the great Proclamation.
('70', 280, 5, 18, 560296) It is a great act whose significance we are yet too near in time to realize.
('70', 280, 5, 19, 560373) During my last tour I addressed a gathering outside the forbidding looking temple walls as they then appeared to me.
('70', 280, 5, 20, 560490) I regard myself voluntarily as a Pulaya or a Pariah, the lowest amongst the low, a Harijan amongst Harijans.
('70', 280, 5, 21, 560599) But the Maharaja himself, as I have now learnt, bears the title of Servant of God, i.e., Harijan, and

('70', 281, 1, 3, 560826) No doubt he is the first among God’s servants, let us hope by right of service.
('70', 281, 1, 4, 560906) He is not the first lord among lords and masters.
('70', 281, 1, 5, 560956) In service there is always open and meritorious competition.
('70', 281, 1, 6, 561017) It demands no reward, no distinction.
('70', 281, 1, 7, 561055) Let us look at the Proclamation in this light.
('70', 281, 1, 8, 561102) Let Nambudiris and other Brahmins and the so called high caste people of Travancore rise to the occasion and be voluntarily Harijans amongst Harijans, servants of God, and let all the world know by their action that in virtue of the Proclamation there is none high and none low but all are equal in the eyes of God.

('70', 281, 4, 11, 561489) January 14, 1937
('70', 281, 5, 12, 561506) I am not a stranger to Nagercoil and for that matter to the whole of Travancore.
('70', 281, 5, 13, 561587) You have more than once made me acquainted with the Nagercoil crowds.
('70', 281, 5, 14, 561657) You have on more than one occasion shown your boundless enthusiasm, if it was only in point of attendance.
('70', 281, 5, 15, 561764) You do not expect me to give you lengthy replies to the addresses you have been good enough to present to me.
('70', 281, 5, 16, 561874) Indeed you need not have presented me with any address at all on this occasion.
('70', 281, 5, 17, 561954) No doubt I have come to share in your rejoicings over the Proclamation.
('70', 281, 5, 18, 562026) But I have come more as a penitent pilgrim than anything else.
('70', 281, 5, 19, 562089) And my mind just now is so full of the duty that lies in front of you in virtue of that Proclamation that I cannot divide my attention among other things.
('70', 281, 5, 20, 562244) Nevertheless I must express my astonishment at getting double addresses from those who are engaged in carriying on Hindi propaganda.
('70', 281, 5, 21, 562377) I have not been able to find out the reason for this overlapping of energy, but I dare not give time to unravelling this mystery.
('70', 281, 5, 22, 562507) Let us consider the duty devolving on those for whom the Proclamation has been designed.
('70', 281, 5, 23, 562596) You may take this Proclamation as an ordinary act of the State to which for the most part people are indifferent, or you may regard it as an extraordinary act of the State on which the future of Hinduism depends; and if you assimilate the spirit of the Proclamation, the result will be astonishing not only for
('70', 281, 6, 24, 562907) 1 The meeting was attended by no less than 50,000 people.
('70', 281, 6, 25, 562965) Addresses of welcome were presented to Gandhiji on behalf of the Municipal Council, the Hindi Prachar Sabha, Nanjinad Sambar Sangam and Hindi Prem Sabha.
('70', 282, 0, 1, 563119) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 283
('70', 282, 1, 2, 563168) Travancore but for the whole of India.
('70', 282, 1, 3, 563207) This untouchability was, and I suppose I must still say is, a weedy growth upon Hinduism, so much so that it threatened to smother the finest flowers of Hinduism.
('70', 282, 1, 4, 563370) I regard this Proclamation as a very brave attempt—an outstanding attempt—to rid Hinduism of the curse of untouchability, and issuing the Proclamation the Maharaja and his advisers have laid the axe at the root of untouchability.
('70', 282, 1, 5, 563600) But the Proclamation will be of no use if there is no response on the part of the savarna and avarna Hindus.
('70', 282, 1, 6, 563709) Ever since my coming to Travancore I have been doing nothing but visiting temples which were until a little while ago forbidden ground to me by my own choice.
('70', 282, 1, 7, 563868) So long as these temples were barred against the major part of the Hindu population to Travancore, the temples could go on as they liked.
('70', 282, 1, 8, 564006) The Proclamation is the beginning of the process of purification of Hinduism, and in the process both savarnas and avarnas have to play their due part.
('70', 282, 1, 9, 564158) It would be a great reflection on savarna Hindus if the untouchables of yesterday were to be left to their own resources.
('70', 282, 1, 10, 564280) It is therefore absolutely necessary for you and me to find out the place temples have in the growth of Hinduism.
('70', 282, 1, 11, 564394) You and I have to find out whether a living God resides in these temples.
('70', 282, 1, 12, 564468) I assure you that our search will be in vain unless we put our hearts into it and apply our minds to it.
('70', 282, 1, 13, 564573) In all humility I fancy that I know how that search is to be made.
('70', 282, 1, 14, 564640) But during this hurried tour and hurriedly got up meeting, it is not possible to dilate on the search.
('70', 282, 1, 15, 564743) I must seek some other and better opportunity for making that enquiry.
('70', 282, 1, 16, 564814) It may be sufficient for the time being if I have succeeded in stimulating your appetite for that search.
('70', 282, 1, 17, 564920) It will give me great satisfaction if I have succeeded in convincing you that we may not take this Proclamation in the ordinary way.
('70', 282, 1, 18, 565053) It will be enough if every man and woman realizes his and her duty with reference to the working of this Proclamation.
('70', 282, 1, 19, 565172) With this thought I propose to leave you to night.

('70', 282, 5, 23, 565306) MIRA, I had your two letters received last night at the Cape—the end of the earth.
('70', 282, 5, 24, 565389) And I had reply by wire to my telegraphic inquiry about you, Shanta and Kumarappa.
('70', 282, 5, 25, 565472) I hope you showed your foot to the C.S.
('70', 283, 0, 1, 565512) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 284
('70', 283, 1, 2, 565554) I am anxious about it.
('70', 283, 1, 3, 565577) You have severe cold there and we here melt on the slightest pretext.
('70', 283, 1, 4, 565647) I hope you are at peace with youself.
('70', 283, 1, 5, 565685) I am not in favour of your going in for new experiments in charkha making.
('70', 283, 1, 6, 565760) The charkha which is the simplest and the best is the cheapest in the long run.
('70', 283, 1, 7, 565840) But if you want to make the experiment you can make it.
('70', 283, 1, 8, 565896) The question of money does not weigh with me.
('70', 283, 1, 9, 565942) It is that of postponing the progress of the boys under training.
('70', 283, 1, 10, 566008) The highest speed has been attained on the flat thing.
('70', 283, 1, 11, 566063) The vertical is cumbersome.
('70', 283, 1, 12, 566091) Remember you are training boys who are unused to any spinning.
('70', 283, 1, 13, 566154) If I were you, I should make them as fit as they can be on the wheel which has proved its worth as the best all round charkha.
('70', 283, 2, 14, 566281) I must not give much time to correspondence, as I want to devote what I have today to Harijan.

('70', 283, 7, 18, 566468) [January 15, 1937] 1
('70', 283, 8, 19, 566489) I am writing this at the Cape in front of the sea where three waters meet and furnish a sight unequalled in the world.
('70', 283, 8, 20, 566608) For this is no port of call for vessels.
('70', 283, 8, 21, 566649) Like the goddess the waters around are virgin.
('70', 283, 8, 22, 566696) The Cape has no population worth the name.
('70', 283, 8, 23, 566739) The place is therefore eminently fitted for contemplation.
('70', 283, 8, 24, 566798) This is the third day of the pilgrimage.
('70', 283, 8, 25, 566839) Having mentally and voluntarily become an untouchable and therefore shunned the temples which were barred against fellow untouchables, I feel like them the joy of the removal of the bar.
('70', 283, 8, 26, 567026) I approached the great temple in Trivandrum with awe and due veneration.
('70', 283, 8, 27, 567099) Curiosity had given way to the incoming of something that was to fill the void of years.
('70', 283, 8, 28, 567188) As I write these lines I am reminded of the peace I felt in the Cathedral in Madras to which Bishop Whitehead had taken me now over twenty years ago.
('70', 283, 8, 29, 567338) In that Cathedral on the particular morning, so far as I remember, we were the only two persons present.
('70', 283, 8, 30, 567443) In the Trivandrum Temple there were thousands awaiting the arrival of my party.
('70', 283, 8, 31, 567523) But there was no noise, no bustle.
('70', 283, 8, 32, 567558) Untouchables of yesterday were in the silent concourse in perhaps
('70', 283, 9, 33, 567624) 1 Gandhiji was at Cape Comorin on this date,
('70', 284, 0, 1, 567669) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 285
('70', 284, 1, 2, 567718) equal numbers.
('70', 284, 1, 3, 567733) I could not distinguish between the two.
('70', 284, 1, 4, 567774) All had almost the same marks on their bodies, all had the same kind of garments.
('70', 284, 1, 5, 567856) Evidently the custom is to have only seamless wear which need not be more than a lungi, never more than a wrapper added to it.
('70', 284, 1, 6, 567983) The majority, including the priests, were bare bodied.
('70', 284, 1, 7, 568038) In the midst of this vast assemblage, I seemed to enjoy the kind of peace I had felt in the Madras Cathedral.
('70', 284, 1, 8, 568148) And yet the two were quite different.
('70', 284, 1, 9, 568186) The Madras peace had no background.
('70', 284, 1, 10, 568222) This the Padmanabha Temple had.
('70', 284, 1, 11, 568254) And I would not have experienced it if the crowd had been boisterous or at all in a non spiritual mood.
('70', 284, 1, 12, 568358) All those bare bodies in spotlessly white lungis standing row upon row in perfectly silent and reverent attitude produced an impression upon me which will endure till life lasts.
('70', 284, 1, 13, 568537) The entry into the very spacious temple, crowded with images which the guiding priest in his choice Hindi made almost to speak, was no less soul stirring.
('70', 284, 1, 14, 568692) Then we reached the great central image.
('70', 284, 1, 15, 568733) It was all like a day dream.
('70', 284, 1, 16, 568762) The knowledge that I was visiting the temple designed specially for the Maharajas of Travancore and that too in the company of the hitherto despised untouchables, heightened the effect which the images and the surroundings had produced upon me.
('70', 284, 1, 17, 569007) The silence and the attitude of worship have continued at the three temples I visited between Trivandrum and the Cape.
('70', 284, 1, 18, 569126) And this morning I visited the famous temple at the Cape, dedicated to the Virgin.
('70', 284, 1, 19, 569209) Accompained by a large party of Harijans who were singing bhajans, we passed through the street leading to the temple.
('70', 284, 1, 20, 569328) The street like the temple was forbidden to the untouchables.
('70', 284, 1, 21, 569390) But now, without any opposition from anywhere, we walked through it and then into the temple as if we had never been prohibited.
('70', 284, 1, 22, 569519) It is a dream realized in a manner and in a place where the realization seemed almost unthinkable before it was realized elsewhere.
('70', 284, 1, 23, 569651) “You may have temples opened in the North, but you will never succeed in having them opened in Cochin and Travancore—the citadels of orthodoxy,” I used to be told before.
('70', 284, 1, 24, 569822) Now one citadel has yielded with rare generosity and grace.
('70', 284, 1, 25, 569882) The genuineness of the generosity and grace seems to have disarmed all opposition.
('70', 284, 1, 26, 569965) The legend attached to the acts of the Maharajas of Travancore had perhaps its due share in the conversion of the people.
('70', 284, 1, 27, 570087) The Maharajas are called ‘Padmanabhadas’, meaning servants of Padmanabha, i.e., God.
('70', 284, 1, 28, 570172) The Maharajas are supposed to visit the temple every morning (and I understand they do whilst in Trivandrum) and receive instructions for the day’s work from God.
('70', 284, 1, 29, 570335) The Proclamation is therefore an act of God through His servant the present Maharaja.
('70', 284, 1, 30, 570421) Whatever may be the cause, the fact of the Proclamation being given effect to by an overwhelming number of savarnas and being availed of by avarnas stands out as a miracle.
('70', 285, 0, 1, 570594) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 286
('70', 285, 1, 2, 570636) But the very miracle weighs me down with a sense of responsibility which chastens me and affects my elation.
('70', 285, 1, 3, 570745) If what is going on today is to be consolidated, there must be continued effort by all true Harijan workers for the education of both savarnas and avarnas on the meaning of the Proclamation.
('70', 285, 1, 4, 570936) But a few months ago it was the fashion on the part of savarnas to say that avarnas did not want temple entry.
('70', 285, 1, 5, 571047) It was equally the fashion on the part of some vocal members among the avarnas to say that they did not care for temple entry and that they cared only for economic uplift.
('70', 285, 1, 6, 571219) Both mistook the meaning of the anti untouchability campaign.
('70', 285, 1, 7, 571281) The Travancore experience has opened their eyes.
('70', 285, 1, 8, 571330) The right of entering temples abolishes untouchability at a stroke—untouchability that prevented a large section of Hindus from sharing with the rest the privilege of worship in the same manner as the latter.
('70', 285, 1, 9, 571539) Economic uplift was there.
('70', 285, 1, 10, 571566) But the best among the avarnas felt the sting of the deprivation.
('70', 285, 1, 11, 571632) It soured them and angered them against the haughty savarnas.
('70', 285, 1, 12, 571694) Now all that has changed.
('70', 285, 1, 13, 571720) The avarnas feel the glow of freedom which they had never felt before.
('70', 285, 1, 14, 571791) All this marvellous result may easily be nullified if it is not followed up to its logical conclusion.
('70', 285, 1, 15, 571894) Before avarnas can forget the past, they must be made conscious of what they have come to.
('70', 285, 1, 16, 571985) The message of freedom must be carried to the humblest hut.
('70', 285, 1, 17, 572045) The minds of the Pulayas and the Pariahs should be opened to the implications of the suddenly acquired freedom.
('70', 285, 1, 18, 572157) This does not need an elaborate programme of literacy.
('70', 285, 1, 19, 572212) That must come.
('70', 285, 1, 20, 572228) But what is needed is immediate human contact.
('70', 285, 1, 21, 572275) For this an army of volunteer workers of the right type is needed.
('70', 285, 1, 22, 572342) And just as the message of freedom has to be taken to the avarna huts, so has it to be taken to the savarna homes.
('70', 285, 1, 23, 572457) Then there is the question of reform of temples from within.
('70', 285, 1, 24, 572518) Here I cannot do better than quote from a long letter from a Mussalman friend who believes in Hinduism as much as he believes in Islam:
('70', 285, 2, 25, 572654) You will soon be going to Travancore to celebrate the entry of Harijans into the temples thrown open to them.
('70', 285, 2, 26, 572764) It is indeed a step forward.
('70', 285, 2, 27, 572793) But what we need most is the restoration of the temples to their pristine purity and sanctity.
('70', 285, 2, 28, 572888) The ideal thing behind temples is most holy.
('70', 285, 2, 29, 572933) In the temples of ancient India resided great rishis who imparted divine wisdom.
('70', 285, 2, 30, 573014) Today the priest sit there barring the way to those who need instruction and help to solve the problems of life.
('70', 285, 2, 31, 573127) the priests of all religions are more in need of instruction than the poor masses.
('70', 285, 2, 32, 573210) These words are true.
('70', 285, 2, 33, 573232) Never was the need for temple reform more urgent than today.
('70', 285, 2, 34, 573293) Fortunately in Travancore the vast majority

('70', 286, 1, 2, 573386) of temples belong to the State and are under special management.
('70', 286, 1, 3, 573451) They are kept clean and often undergo improvement and addition.
('70', 286, 1, 4, 573515) They are never empty.
('70', 286, 1, 5, 573537) They supply a felt want.
('70', 286, 1, 6, 573562) If the priests had better education and would be custodians of the spirituality of the people, the temples would be houses both of worship and spiritual instruction as they were before.

('70', 286, 4, 9, 573796) KANYAKUMARI, January 15, 1937
('70', 286, 6, 10, 573826) I have your letter.
('70', 286, 6, 11, 573846) You can stay with Dwarkadas as long as you please.
('70', 286, 6, 12, 573897) Your staying there does not mean that you should become lazy.
('70', 286, 6, 13, 573959) Your spinning, reading, praying, etc., should regularly go on.
('70', 286, 6, 14, 574022) It will not do to start on them afresh when you come to me.
('70', 286, 6, 15, 574082) And it will not be right if you do not follow rules in eating and drinking.
('70', 286, 6, 16, 574158) I would rather that Dwarkadas was not taken to another hospital or another doctor.
('70', 286, 6, 17, 574241) You are absolutely right in saying that all doctors belong to the same brotherhood.
('70', 286, 6, 18, 574325) Hence, so long as a patient is willing to stick to the same doctor, it is not right to create doubts in his mind.
('70', 286, 6, 19, 574439) Even the desire to go to a vaidya should be overcome.
('70', 286, 6, 20, 574493) Nature cure is another matter.
('70', 286, 6, 21, 574524) But in my view even for that the time has passed.
('70', 286, 6, 22, 574574) So there is no need to insist on it.
('70', 286, 6, 23, 574611) I am also a believer in fate.
('70', 286, 6, 24, 574641) There is considerable truth in the saying “what fate has decreed cannot be otherwise”.
('70', 286, 6, 25, 574728) Only such a belief can give us strength for endurance.
('70', 286, 6, 26, 574783) Human effort has its limitations.

('70', 287, 1, 2, 575274) 321. WHAT IS KHADI SCIENCE?
('70', 287, 2, 3, 575302) I have often said that if khadi is a sound economic proposition it is also a science and a romance.
('70', 287, 2, 4, 575402) I believe there is a book called The Romance of Cotton wherein the origin of cotton has been traced and an attempt made to show how its discovery altered the course of civilization.
('70', 287, 2, 5, 575584) Everything can be turned into a science or a romance if there is a scientific or a romantic spirit behind it.
('70', 287, 2, 6, 575694) Some people scoff at khadi and betray signs of impatience or disgust when one talks of hand spinning.
('70', 287, 2, 7, 575796) But it ceases to be an object of disgust or ridicule immediately you attribute to it the power of removing India wide idleness, unemployment and consequent pauperism.
('70', 287, 2, 8, 575963) It need not be, as a matter of fact, a panacea for the three ills.
('70', 287, 2, 9, 576030) To be absorbingly interesting, the mere honest attributing of the power is enough.
('70', 287, 2, 10, 576113) But you cannot attribute that potency to khadi and pursue it, as some do, in the manner of an ignorant needy artisan who gins, cards, spins or weaves because he must for his bread.
('70', 287, 2, 11, 576294) A believer in its potency will pursue it in a deliberate, wise, methodical manner and in a scientific spirit, taking nothing for granted, testing every proposition, checking facts and figures, undaunted by defeats, unelated by petty successes, never satisfied till the goal is reached.
('70', 287, 2, 12, 576580) The late Maganlal Gandhi had a living faith in the potency of khadi.
('70', 287, 2, 13, 576649) It was for him a thrilling romance.
('70', 287, 2, 14, 576685) And he wrote the elements of the science of khadi.
('70', 287, 2, 15, 576736) No detail was too trifling for him, no scheme was too big for him.
('70', 287, 2, 16, 576803) Richard Gregg had and has the same fire in him.
('70', 287, 2, 17, 576851) He has given it a universal meaning.
('70', 287, 2, 18, 576888) His Economics of Khaddar is an original contribution to the movement.
('70', 287, 2, 19, 576958) He recognizes the spinning wheel as the symbol par excellence of non violence.
('70', 287, 2, 20, 577037) It may or may not be all that.
('70', 287, 2, 21, 577068) But their belief gave Maganlal Gandhi and gives Richard Gregg all the joy and pleasure derivable from any fascination theme.
('70', 287, 2, 22, 577193) A science to be science must afford the fullest scope for satisfying the hunger of body, mind and soul.
('70', 287, 2, 23, 577297) Sceptics have wondered how khadi can afford such satisfaction or, in other words, what I mean when I use the expression “Science of Khadi”.
('70', 287, 2, 24, 577437) I cannot better answer the question than by copying below the questions framed by me hurriedly for a khadi worker who offered to be examined by me.
('70', 287, 2, 25, 577585) The questions were not framed in their logical sequence nor were they exhaustive.
('70', 287, 2, 26, 577667) They admit of rearrangement and addition.
('70', 287, 2, 27, 577709) But I reproduce a translation made for me by a friend from the original in Hindi.

('70', 290, 2, 3, 581880) FOR KHADI ORGANIZATIONS
('70', 290, 3, 4, 581904) The year 1936 is just over and all khadi organizations would do well to examine promptly and carefully the results of the year’s work and submit their statements to the A.I.S.A. office.
('70', 290, 3, 5, 582090) I have asked the latter to produce a brief but full report of the work of the Association during the last year, particularly with reference to the working of the new scheme of increased spinning wages.
('70', 290, 3, 6, 582292) Such a report can be had only if all the branches and the various organizations affiliated to the Association readily co operate and send without delay accurate particulars regarding work done and results achieved by them to the Central Office.
('70', 290, 3, 7, 582537) The plans and programme for the current year have to be prepared at once, and for this, too, full information regarding the previous year’s working is indispensable.
('70', 290, 3, 8, 582703) I hope therefore that khadi organizations will realize the urgency and supply all available information to the A.I.S.A. office at the earliest moment.
('70', 290, 3, 9, 582854) Let them remember that time is of the essence in this matter.
('70', 290, 4, 10, 582916) SPINNERS’ WAGES
('70', 290, 5, 11, 582932) The council of the A.I.S.A. has decided that the A.I.S.A. branches and its certified organizations should give spinning wages on the basis of a scale sufficient to enable the spinner to have, besides minimum clothing requirements, adequate nutritive diet for eight hours’ efficient work.
('70', 290, 5, 12, 583220) The various branches and organizations have, in accordance with this decision, fixed suitable standards of spinning rates which are calculated to enable the spinner to earn a daily wage of Rs. 2 to 2 1/2 .
('70', 290, 5, 13, 583426) This wage is, however, related to efficient work and can be actually earned only if the requisite standard of output and quality of yarn is attained by the spinner.
('70', 290, 5, 14, 583591) The standard fixed, though high, is not difficult to attain, but it must be admitted that at the present time only a small percentage of the spinners has come up to it, partly because of the crudeness of the spinning wheels and slivers they use and partly because of their lack of skill.
('70', 290, 5, 15, 583879) The real objective of the scheme is, however, not merely to lay down a reasonable scale for wage basis but to enable the bulk of the spinners to actually earn the same.
('70', 290, 5, 16, 584048) It, therefore, becomes the duty of all workers engaged in production activity to do all that they can to help the spinners to attain the requisite skill besides securing satisfactory wheels and slivers so as to ensure the actual earning of the desired wage by them.
('70', 290, 5, 17, 584314) It is hoped
('70', 291, 0, 1, 584326) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 292
('70', 291, 1, 2, 584368) the khadi workers will not rest content until the majority of the spinners on their registers actually earn the amount aimed at.
('70', 291, 1, 3, 584497) Let them also realize that the higher scale is not the highest aimed at.
('70', 291, 1, 4, 584570) The real aim in terms of present values is to ensure eight annas for eight hours’ attentive and skilled spinning.
('70', 291, 1, 5, 584684) That may be a far off event.
('70', 291, 1, 6, 584713) But it will never come unless very early ten pice become as natural as three are today.
('70', 291, 1, 7, 584801) Let it be also remembered that in the new scale the increase is roughly distributed half and half between the effort of the spinner and the rise given by the A.I.S.A.
('70', 291, 2, 8, 584968) AN IMPORTANT CORRECTION
('70', 291, 3, 9, 584992) I know there are readers of Harijan who study many articles that appear from time to time in Harijan.
('70', 291, 3, 10, 585094) The weekly is not published for providing momentary amusement or pleasure for the reader.
('70', 291, 3, 11, 585184) It is designed to be a serious contribution to the Harijan cause in the widest sense of the term.
('70', 291, 3, 12, 585282) It therefore often contains writings of more than transitory value.
('70', 291, 3, 13, 585350) Hence serious errors need to be corrected.
('70', 291, 3, 14, 585393) Such an error was detected in the Harijan of the 9th inst.
('70', 291, 3, 15, 585452) at page 382, 2nd column, line 2. Read ‘sub human’ for ‘human’.

('70', 292, 2, 3, 586185) January 16, 1937
('70', 292, 3, 4, 586202) It gives me very great pleasure to be in your midst for the third time.
('70', 292, 3, 5, 586274) The first time I was here, I had the pleasure of paying my respects to your Guru, the great Swami.
('70', 292, 3, 6, 586373) 1 You have invited me to study his work in your midst.
('70', 292, 3, 7, 586428) Well, I did so as fervently as I could even on the first occasion I was here.
('70', 292, 3, 8, 586506) I had long and serious discussions with him over matters of common interest, and I had no difficulty in agreeing with him on many subjects of which we spoke.
('70', 292, 3, 9, 586664) I had discussions also at that time with his first and learned disciples.
('70', 292, 3, 10, 586738) After his lamented death, his disciples sent me many things including a collection of the Swami’s sayings.
('70', 292, 3, 11, 586845) I studied them with the respect that the work of such a great man demanded.
('70', 292, 3, 12, 586921) You are quite right in saying that every time I have come here I have taken away something for myself.
('70', 292, 3, 13, 587024) I admit that I have no title whatsoever to the title of “Mahatma”.
('70', 292, 3, 14, 587091) That title has often embarrassed me, sometimes it has stunk in my nostrils.
('70', 292, 3, 15, 587167) This has happened whenever with the name of ‘Mahatma’ on their lips people have done something unworthy.
('70', 292, 3, 16, 587272) I have no new religion to give, no new truth to expound.
('70', 292, 3, 17, 587329) My humble role is that of a scavenger both literally and spiritually.
('70', 292, 3, 18, 587399) I know the outward art of cleaning the streets, commodes and latrines, and I am endeavouring to the extent of my ability to clean my inside also, so that I may become a faithful interpreter of the truth as I may see it.
('70', 292, 3, 19, 587619) Of course I had many things in common with the teachings of the Swami.
('70', 292, 3, 20, 587690) I do believe that there is only one religion in the world, but I also believe that although it is one mighty tree, it has many branches.
('70', 292, 3, 21, 587827) I tried to explain this thing to the Swami as I recollect even today.
('70', 292, 3, 22, 587897) And even as all the branches take their sap from one source, even so all religions derive their essence from one fountain source.
('70', 292, 3, 23, 588027) Of course there can be only one God if there is one religion, and God who is one complete whole cannot have many branches.
('70', 292, 3, 24, 588150) But He is invisible and indefinable and, one might literally say that He has as many names as there are human beings on earth.
('70', 292, 3, 25, 588277) No matter by what name we describe Him, He is the same without a second and if we are all children of the same Creator, naturally there cannot be any caste amongst us.
('70', 292, 3, 26, 588445) We are one brotherhood and sisterhood, and there cannot
('70', 292, 4, 27, 588501) 1 Narayanguru Swami
('70', 293, 0, 1, 588521) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 294
('70', 293, 1, 2, 588563) be any distinction of high and low amongst us.
('70', 293, 1, 3, 588610) There are no savarnas and avarnas, or all are savarnas or all are avarnas.
('70', 293, 1, 4, 588685) But each one of us has his or her occupation cut out for himself or herself.
('70', 293, 1, 5, 588762) This occupation is not caste, but it is known in Hinduism as varna, which has nothing in common with caste as we understand it today.
('70', 293, 1, 6, 588896) Caste is a man made institution only, fit to be destroyed, but varna is a divine law.
('70', 293, 1, 7, 588982) We may disregard it to our harm, and we will profit by it if we follow it.
('70', 293, 1, 8, 589057) A carpenter, a blacksmith, a mason, a scavenger, a bricklayer, a teacher, a soldier—these have different occupations, but none is high and none is low among them.
('70', 293, 1, 9, 589220) And if we begin to overlap one another, we create a sankara (confusion) of all varnas.
('70', 293, 1, 10, 589307) Therefore immediately you take away the sting of distinction from different varnas, it becomes not only a law, but it gives us an opportunity of doing what we are particularly fitted for.
('70', 293, 1, 11, 589495) That is what Hinduism teaches us.
('70', 293, 1, 12, 589529) That is my interpretation of all true religions.
('70', 293, 1, 13, 589578) That is my interpretation of Hinduism pure and undefiled.
('70', 293, 1, 14, 589636) So far as I understood the great Swami, he did not dissent from the view I have just expounded to you.
('70', 293, 1, 15, 589739) You have tickled me by inviting me to come and settle down here.
('70', 293, 1, 16, 589804) The temptation is really great.
('70', 293, 1, 17, 589836) This is one of the pleasantest spots in India and the weather here is magnificent.
('70', 293, 1, 18, 589919) I know that if I should come here I should be surrounded by friends who would provide me with all my needs.
('70', 293, 1, 19, 590027) But the path of life, if taken religiously, is strait and narrow.
('70', 293, 1, 20, 590093) It has been described as sharp as the edge of a sword.
('70', 293, 1, 21, 590148) You cannot look this side or that side without stumbling into an abyss.
('70', 293, 1, 22, 590220) And the Gita says that better by far is the religion which is cut out for you than one for which you are not born.
('70', 293, 1, 23, 590335) Therefore, although the temptation you have held forth is very great, I must resist it just now.

('70', 293, 4, 27, 590493) January 16, 1937
('70', 293, 5, 28, 590510) It gives me great pleasure to be in your midst.
('70', 293, 5, 29, 590558) I see from your address, which I have already read, that many of you have walked nearly 22 miles to come to this meeting.
('70', 293, 5, 30, 590680) I am sorry that it was not possible for the managers of this tour to enable me to go to your places in the hills.
('70', 294, 0, 1, 590794) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 295
('70', 294, 1, 2, 590843) I have heard something of the great work that is being done by Sjt.
('70', 294, 1, 3, 590911) Raman Pillai among the hill tribes of Kadakal and Paripalli.
('70', 294, 1, 4, 590972) Evidently from his hoary beard he appears to be as old as I, if not older.
('70', 294, 1, 5, 591047) But from the energy with which he addressed this meeting, I thought he was a young old man.
('70', 294, 1, 6, 591139) It gives me great joy to know that in him you have an indefatigable worker, guide and friend.
('70', 294, 1, 7, 591233) I am glad to find that several activities are being conducted for your benefit.
('70', 294, 1, 8, 591313) You are right in saying that this Proclamation is epoch making and glorious.
('70', 294, 1, 9, 591390) It is like a gift suddenly come into the possession of a man who is not fit to receive it.
('70', 294, 1, 10, 591481) The suddenness of it shows that it is something for which neither you nor I were prepared.
('70', 294, 1, 11, 591572) Not that what has been given was not due to us.
('70', 294, 1, 12, 591620) But the deprivation of many long years seemed to make us unfit to receive the gift when it came.
('70', 294, 1, 13, 591717) But what I have been witnessing round me shows that you were fit for the gift, and having got the gift it appears you were never deprived of it.
('70', 294, 1, 14, 591862) For I know that wherever I have visited temples—where there were Harijans and non Harijans—I failed to see any distinction between the two.
('70', 294, 1, 15, 592002) The demeanour and attitude of the Harijans seemed to be as if they were to the manner born.
('70', 294, 1, 16, 592094) They were spotlessly clean and their attitude of reverence left nothing to be desired.
('70', 294, 1, 17, 592181) There was among all these men and women a dignity that was truly captivating.
('70', 294, 2, 18, 592259) But we should be making a serious mistake if we thought that nothing now remains to be done.
('70', 294, 2, 19, 592352) The present gives the promise of a bright future if we take the full advantage of the opportunities given to us by reason of the Proclamation.
('70', 294, 2, 20, 592495) I do hope that many savarna Hindu workers will come forward to carry the message of the Proclamation to the avarnas, to take them out of their huts, accustom them to going to the temples, and explain to them the implications of the Proclamation.
('70', 294, 2, 21, 592741) For sceptics and heretics the temples have no meaning, but for one who has believed in temples there is no mistaking the fact that constant temple going changes the whole outlook on life of temple goers.
('70', 294, 2, 22, 592945) May this be realized among all these so called avarnas.

('70', 295, 2, 3, 593109) QUILON, January 16, 1937
('70', 295, 3, 4, 593134) BRAJKISAN,
('70', 295, 4, 5, 593145) I have your letter.
('70', 295, 4, 6, 593165) You did indeed commit an error.
('70', 295, 4, 7, 593197) It has done no good either to Damodar or to Vishwanath.
('70', 295, 4, 8, 593253) Its doing you any good was of course out of the question.
('70', 295, 4, 9, 593311) But telling you this will not undo the error, nor will your giving up salt, which in any case has no bearing upon this error arising from attachment.
('70', 295, 4, 10, 593461) I have already told you that the allowance you receive is for your maintenance and is not to be spent for the satisfaction of your personal cravings.
('70', 295, 4, 11, 593611) And that if anything is left over it should be spent for public service.
('70', 295, 4, 12, 593684) I have no hopes of Damodar or Vishwanath.
('70', 295, 4, 13, 593726) What you now propose to do is the right thing.
('70', 295, 4, 14, 593773) Sell the books and such other things and repay the debt.
('70', 295, 4, 15, 593830) If the amount thus obtained is insufficient you may earn some by your own labour; otherwise be patient.
('70', 295, 4, 16, 593934) Your best repentance will be to make sure that you do not ever again make the same mistake and are careful in everything.
('70', 295, 4, 17, 594056) I return you the letter.
('70', 295, 4, 18, 594081) Mother, I hope, is well.
('70', 295, 4, 19, 594106) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] I shall probably return to Wardha on the 24th.

('70', 295, 6, 21, 594220) 327. SPEECH AT QUILON
('70', 295, 7, 22, 594242) January 16, 1937 I am deeply grateful to you for having waived your undoubted right of reading your address.
('70', 295, 7, 23, 594351) 1 You have been good enough to save your time and my time.
('70', 295, 7, 24, 594410) I am no stranger to this place.
('70', 295, 7, 25, 594442) I have many a happy recollection of my stay here.
('70', 295, 7, 26, 594492) When I came here last it was thought a presumption for an avarna to enter a temple, but now I have come to share with you your rejoicing over the Proclamation.
('70', 295, 7, 27, 594652) It is a brave, generous and gracious act and it combines the enthusiasm of the young Maharaja with the wisdom and courage of Her Highness
('70', 295, 8, 28, 594790) 1 The address was presented by K. S. Parameswara Pillay, Chairman of the Municipal Council.
('70', 296, 0, 1, 594882) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 297
('70', 296, 1, 2, 594931) the Maharani, his mother.
('70', 296, 1, 3, 594957) As you may be aware, I had the pleasure and privilege of waiting upon them in their palace and renewing their acquaintance.
('70', 296, 1, 4, 595081) The Maharani’s queenly heart was full of joy over the manner in which the avarnas and the savarnas had received the Proclamation, and I saw the young Maharaja nodding his assent to everything that his gracious mother was saying to him.
('70', 296, 1, 5, 595317) And every lover of the State, from one end of India to the other, has testified to the fact that the Proclamation lacks nothing in completeness.
('70', 296, 1, 6, 595462) By a stroke of the pen, it opens all State temples to all those who call themselves Hindus without the slightest reservation.
('70', 296, 1, 7, 595588) As I have said so often, such an act could not be prompted by any purely worldly considerations.
('70', 296, 1, 8, 595685) There must have been the spirit of God inspiring both the wise mother and the brave son.
('70', 296, 1, 9, 595774) As I have been going from temple to temple and looking at beaming faces of perhaps tens of thousands of men and women, mingling together without the slightest distinction, I confess I have not been able to restrain my joy at the sight.
('70', 296, 1, 10, 596010) I have called it a great religious revival that is going on in Travancore.
('70', 296, 1, 11, 596085) That religious revival began some years ago, but we had no visible sign, no visible demonstration of it.
('70', 296, 1, 12, 596190) But this Proclamation is a visible demonstration of the revival which he who runs may read.
('70', 296, 1, 13, 596282) To me it is a great sign of purification of our ancient faith.
('70', 296, 1, 14, 596345) I have held for now close on half a century that untouchability is the greatest blot on Hinduism, and therefore you can only imagine—I cannot describe it fully—my joy over the Proclamation.
('70', 296, 1, 15, 596535) I congratulate all the Travancorians on this signal gift which you have received from your Prince.
('70', 296, 1, 16, 596634) I only hope that you, who have begun so well, will also end well, till the light that has been lit in Travancore will spread throughout Bharatvarsha.
('70', 296, 1, 17, 596784) The Maharani and the Maharaja and the Dewan have done their duty.
('70', 296, 1, 18, 596850) They can do no more.
('70', 296, 1, 19, 596871) But if this light is to spread throughout India, it will be purely as a result of your response to the Proclamation.
('70', 296, 1, 20, 596988) You have to understand the implications of this great act and your response must not be purely formal, but must come from the bottom of your heart and then, and not till then, will be manifested the great change of heart for which I have been pining all these years and for which I have always been fervently praying.
('70', 296, 1, 21, 597306) Let me for a few moments consider what Hinduism consists of, what it is that has fired so many saints about whom we have historical record.
('70', 296, 1, 22, 597446) Why has it contributed so many philosophers to the world?
('70', 296, 1, 23, 597504) What is it in Hinduism that has so enthused its devotees for centuries?
('70', 296, 1, 24, 597576) Did they see untouchability in Hinduism and still enthuse over it?
('70', 296, 1, 25, 597643) In the midst of my struggle against untouchability I have been asked by
('70', 297, 0, 1, 597715) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 298
('70', 297, 1, 2, 597757) several workers as to the esssence of Hinduism.
('70', 297, 1, 3, 597805) We have no simple Kalema 1, they said, that we find in Islam, nor have we 3.16 St. John 2 of the Bible.
('70', 297, 1, 4, 597909) Have we or have we not something that will answer the demands of the most philosophic among the Hindus or the most matter of fact among them?
('70', 297, 1, 5, 598051) Some have said, and not without good reason, that the Gayatri answers that purpose.
('70', 297, 1, 6, 598135) I have perhaps recited the Gayatri mantra thousands of times, having understood the meaning of it.
('70', 297, 1, 7, 598234) But still it seems to me that it did not answer the whole of my aspirations.
('70', 297, 1, 8, 598311) Then as you are aware I have, for years past, been swearing by the Bhagavad Gita, and have said that it answers all my difficulties and has been my Kamadhenu, the Cow of plenty, my guide, my open sesame, at hundreds of moments of doubt and difficulty.
('70', 297, 1, 9, 598563) I cannot recall a single occasion when it has failed me.
('70', 297, 1, 10, 598620) But it is not a book that I can place before the whole of this audience.
('70', 297, 1, 11, 598693) It requires a prayerful study before the Kamadhenu yields the rich milk she holds in her udder.
('70', 297, 2, 12, 598789) But I have fixed upon the mantra that I am going to recite to you, as containing the whole essence of Hinduism.
('70', 297, 2, 13, 598901) Many of you, I think, know the Ishopanishad.
('70', 297, 2, 14, 598946) I read it years ago with translation and commentary.
('70', 297, 2, 15, 598999) I learnt it by heart in Yeravda Jail.
('70', 297, 2, 16, 599037) But it did not then captivate me as it has done during the past few months, and I have now come to the final conclusion that if all the Upanishads and all the other scriptures happened all of a sudden to be reduced to ashes and if only the first verse in the Ishopanishad were left intact in the memory of Hindus, Hinduism would live for ever.
('70', 297, 3, 17, 599381) Now this mantra divides itself in four parts.
('70', 297, 3, 18, 599427) The first part is.
('70', 297, 4, 19, 599446) It means, as I would translate: All this that we see in this great Universe is pervaded by God.
('70', 297, 4, 20, 599542) Then come the second and third parts which read together, as I read them:
('70', 297, 5, 21, 599616) I divide these into two and translate them thus: Renounce it and enjoy it.
('70', 297, 5, 22, 599691) There is another rendering which means the same thing, though: Enjoy what He gives you.
('70', 297, 5, 23, 599779) Even so you can divide it into two parts.
('70', 297, 5, 24, 599821) Then follows the final and most important part:
('70', 297, 6, 25, 599869) which means: Do not covet anybody’s wealth or possession.
('70', 297, 6, 26, 599927) All the other mantras of that ancient Upanishad are a commentary or an attempt to give us the full meaning of the first mantra.
('70', 297, 6, 27, 600055) As I read the mantra in the light of the Gita or the Gita in the
('70', 297, 7, 28, 600120) 1 “There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is His Prophet.” 2 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
('70', 298, 0, 1, 600325) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 299
('70', 298, 1, 2, 600374) light of the mantra I find that the Gita is a commentary on this mantra.
('70', 298, 1, 3, 600447) It seems to me to satisfy the cravings of the socialist and the communist, of the philosopher and the economist.
('70', 298, 1, 4, 600560) I venture to suggest to all who do not belong to the Hindu faith that it satisfies their cravings also.
('70', 298, 1, 5, 600664) And if it is true—and I hold it to be true—you need not take anything in Hinduism which is inconsistent with or contrary to the meaning of this mantra.
('70', 298, 1, 6, 600816) What more can a man in the street want to learn than this that the one God and Creator and Master of all that lives pervades the Universe?
('70', 298, 1, 7, 600955) The three other parts of the mantra follow directly from the first.
('70', 298, 1, 8, 601023) If you believe that God pervades everything that He has created, you must believe that you cannot enjoy anything that is not given by Him.
('70', 298, 1, 9, 601162) And seeing that He is the Creator of His numberless children, it follows that you cannot covet anybody’s possession.
('70', 298, 1, 10, 601279) If you think that you are one of His numerous creatures, it behoves you to renounce everything and lay it at His feet.
('70', 298, 1, 11, 601398) That means that the act of renunciation of everything is not a mere physical renunciation but represents a second or new birth.
('70', 298, 1, 12, 601526) It is a deliberate act, not done in ignorance.
('70', 298, 1, 13, 601573) It is therefore a regeneration.
('70', 298, 1, 14, 601605) And then, since he who holds the body must eat and drink and clothe himself, he must naturally seek all that he needs from Him.
('70', 298, 1, 15, 601733) And he gets it as a natural reward of that renunciation.
('70', 298, 1, 16, 601790) As if this was not enough, the mantra closes with this magnificent thought: Do not covet anybody’s possession.
('70', 298, 1, 17, 601901) The moment you carry out these precepts you become a wise citizen of the world, living at peace with all that lives.
('70', 298, 1, 18, 602018) It satisfies one’s highest aspirations on this earth and hereafter.
('70', 298, 1, 19, 602086) No doubt it will not satisfy the aspirations of him who does not believe in God and His undisputed sovereignty.
('70', 298, 1, 20, 602198) It is no idle thing that the Maharaja of Travancore is called Padmanabhadas.
('70', 298, 1, 21, 602275) It is a great thought.
('70', 298, 1, 22, 602298) We know that God Himself has taken the title of Dasanudas—servant of servants.
('70', 298, 1, 23, 602377) If all the princes would call themselves servants of God, they would be correctly describing themselves, but they cannot be servants of God unless they are servants of the people.
('70', 298, 1, 24, 602557) And if zamindars and monied men and all who have possessions would treat themselves as trustees and perform the act of renunciation that I have described, this world would indeed be a blessed world to live in.
('70', 298, 1, 25, 602767) I must not labour the meaning of this mantra any longer.
('70', 298, 1, 26, 602824) I know that many of you here are learned men.
('70', 298, 1, 27, 602870) My knowledge of Sanskrit is poor and I am a man of the street having no pretensions to learning, but what little I have read and what little has commended

('70', 299, 1, 2, 603067) itself to me I have assimilated.
('70', 299, 1, 3, 603100) I suggest to you that this mantra has nothing abstruse in it.
('70', 299, 1, 4, 603162) Anybody can understand its meaning and follow it out in daily life.
('70', 299, 1, 5, 603230) Therefore I want to suggest to the whole of this audience that they should carry the whole of this mantra in Malayalam to every home and help everyone to shape their lives in accordance with this mantra; and I make bold to say that having done so they may, without reading any other scriptures, call themselves Hindus.
('70', 299, 1, 6, 603549) Disputes and differences arise when you begin to read big tomes and discuss interpretations of varying dictums contained in them.
('70', 299, 1, 7, 603679) But now that, in virtue of this Proclamation, the distinction between high and low is abolished in Travancore, and there are no avarnas and savarnas, you will see that this mantra will satisfy all your wants.
('70', 299, 1, 8, 603888) You will model your conduct in the spirit of this mantra and you will not find it difficult to live in the spirit of this Proclamation.
('70', 299, 1, 9, 604024) I am saying this with a full sense of my responsibility.
('70', 299, 1, 10, 604081) It is for you the people of Travancore to make or unmake this act of the great king.
('70', 299, 1, 11, 604166) The opportunity for serving one’s faith or one’s fellowmen does not easily occur.
('70', 299, 1, 12, 604248) That opportunity has come to you all of a sudden.
('70', 299, 1, 13, 604298) May God grant you the measure of understanding that is necessary to live up to the spirit of this Proclamation.

('70', 299, 4, 17, 604483) We find that many of the things we do are contrary to our beliefs or our religion.
('70', 299, 4, 18, 604566) We believe that we should speak the truth, yet we practise untruth; we believe that we should not indulge in immoral activities but we do indulge in them; we believe that we should refrain from violence, yet we practise it at every moment; we believe that we should win swaraj, yet do much which is contrary to this belief.
('70', 299, 4, 19, 604890) We do not even do khadi work which will promote swaraj.
('70', 299, 4, 20, 604946) The human race would perish if it always acted against its beliefs in all matters.
('70', 299, 4, 21, 605029) Innum erable persons thoughtlessly do what should not be done.
('70', 299, 4, 22, 605092) The foregoing describes the plight of those who have formed the habit of thinking.
('70', 299, 4, 23, 605175) Failure to serve the cow is an instance of conduct contrary to religion.
('70', 299, 4, 24, 605248) Every Hindu believes that it is his special dharma to serve the cow.
('70', 299, 4, 25, 605317) But only a handful of Hindus will be found to observe the basic rules of goseva.
('70', 299, 4, 26, 605398) Many persons believe that they have done their duty once they have put a couple of pice into the cow protection fund.
('70', 299, 4, 27, 605516) These thoughts came to my mind while reading a letter written by Shri
('70', 300, 0, 1, 605586) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 301
('70', 300, 1, 2, 605635) Purushottam Narhar Joshi who calls himself a “gosevak”.
('70', 300, 1, 3, 605691) Shri Joshi is not only the head of the State goshala of Bhavnagar but also takes interest in cattle development.
('70', 300, 1, 4, 605804) His letter 1 runs as follows.
('70', 300, 1, 5, 605834) Who will not believe while reading this letter that cowslaughter is being practised under the guise of cow protection?
('70', 300, 1, 6, 605953) We do not become murderers only when we commit actual murder with a knife.
('70', 300, 1, 7, 606028) We commit murder even when we watch someone else being murdered and do not attempt to prevent it even though it is within our power to do so.
('70', 300, 1, 8, 606170) Many of the suggestions made by the gosevak Shri Joshi can be put into practice anywhere in India.
('70', 300, 1, 9, 606269) His letter is mainly addressed to Kathiawar and particularly the ruling princes there, as they can easily take up this work.
('70', 300, 1, 10, 606394) Every State can set up one or more dairies, keep good stud bulls for the benefit of the people, castrate each and every male calf, supply good cows to whosoever needs them, provide facilities for training in animal husbandry, maintain pastures within their own States and prevent the cruel slaughter of buffalo bulls which is being practised.
('70', 300, 1, 11, 606737) I shall take up later the suggestions which Shri Joshi has made about the activities of the Goseva Sangh.

('70', 300, 4, 14, 606914) January 17, 1937 As a matter of fact I am ill able to speak to you this morning.
('70', 300, 4, 15, 606995) Ever since my arrival in Travancore I have been suffering from a bad cold and I am afraid I cannot give you a considered speech.
('70', 300, 4, 16, 607124) I am glad Hindi is making steady progress.
('70', 300, 4, 17, 607167) I wish everyone knowing English will hold it a crying shame not to be able to speak Hindi as well as English.
('70', 300, 4, 18, 607277) I tell you it will not take as many years as the study of English does.
('70', 300, 4, 19, 607349) One reason why it is easier than English is that it has a vocabulary which is common to Malayalam and, even like geographical and climatic conditions, the religious conditions of this great country make all tongues of India in many respects common.
('70', 300, 4, 20, 607598) The sound of different languages does not strike as strange to our ears.
('70', 300, 4, 21, 607671) When I hear Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, Oriya or Bengali, I
('70', 300, 5, 22, 607730) 1 Not translated here.
('70', 300, 5, 23, 607753) The correspondent had said that though cows played a very important part in the national life of India, they were neglected.
('70', 300, 5, 24, 607878) Because of poor breeding bullocks were unsuitable for draught purposes.
('70', 300, 5, 25, 607950) He had suggested that the Goseva Sangh should draw up a plan for improving the condition and breed of cows.
('70', 301, 0, 1, 608058) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 302
('70', 301, 1, 2, 608100) assure you my ears do not notice any foreign element in that sound and although I do not know these languages I can very often gather the drift because of the common words in these languages.
('70', 301, 1, 3, 608292) Now if I were to read this Hindi address to you, I am sure you will notice that many words in it are common to Malayalam.
('70', 301, 1, 4, 608414) Addressing a meeting in Bangalore, I showed that the majority of words in Hindi were quite common to Kannada.
('70', 301, 1, 5, 608524) Now I have not said all these things in order to worry you for nothing.
('70', 301, 1, 6, 608596) From an all India point of view, it is a foregone conclusion that you must know Hindi.
('70', 301, 1, 7, 608683) But it has something to do with the Proclamation also.
('70', 301, 1, 8, 608738) If the savarnas are to give effect to the Proclamation, they must be blood brothers with the avarnas, and for that you must spread yourselves amongst avarnas.
('70', 301, 1, 9, 608897) And if there is any spirituality in you, it will overflow in many directions.
('70', 301, 1, 10, 608975) I had a Pulaya girl coming to me this morning with a petition in her hand.
('70', 301, 1, 11, 609050) She was a very good specimen of humanity, but she presented her petition in bad English.
('70', 301, 1, 12, 609139) She wanted some help for her English studies.
('70', 301, 1, 13, 609185) The person who wrote the petition for her had misrepresented things, but I could not ascertain the correct position from her as she could neither talk Hindi nor English.
('70', 301, 1, 14, 609355) I have of course handed over her petition to the local Harijan Sevak Sangh.
('70', 301, 1, 15, 609431) But if this girl had been taught Hindi, I am sure she would have been able to talk to me fluently.
('70', 301, 1, 16, 609530) I must tell you that a girl of thirteen should be able to call herself an Indian, not merely a Travancorian.
('70', 301, 1, 17, 609639) Had she known Hindi, she would have been able to travel from one end of India to another without much difficulty.
('70', 301, 1, 18, 609753) Now fly with me on the wings of your imagination to the Hindukush.
('70', 301, 1, 19, 609820) What would happen to the girl there?
('70', 301, 1, 20, 609857) She would be as much at home in Kashmir as here.
('70', 301, 1, 21, 609906) Here is the point I am trying to make.
('70', 301, 1, 22, 609945) Supposing you have understood the point of my remark and decided to go about amongst avarnas, you will teach them not English but Hindi, and thereby you will enrich yourselves and enrich the boys and girls you will take up, and you will broaden your outlook and theirs, and not commit the atrocious blunder of giving them a modicum of bad English, but straight away you will give them the treasures hidden in Tulsidas.
('70', 301, 1, 23, 610364) For believe me the Proclamation can become a dead letter not through any fault of the Maharaja but through sins of omissions and commissions on your part.

('70', 302, 1, 2, 610604) 330. SPEECH AT HARIPAD
('70', 302, 2, 3, 610627) January 17, 1937 At this meeting I would love to detain you for a few minutes on the message of Hinduism I gave to the meeting in Quilon last night.
('70', 302, 2, 4, 610776) I ventured at that meeting to say that the whole of Hinduism could be summed up in the first verse of Ishopanishad.
('70', 302, 2, 5, 610892) I suggested then that if all other Hindu scriptures happened to be reduced to ashes and to go out of the memory of men and if only that one verse were to abide with us, the destruction would be no loss.
('70', 302, 2, 6, 611095) Hinduism would even then remain with us.
('70', 302, 2, 7, 611136) The original Sanskrit of the mantra is perhaps as easy as anybody learning Sanskrit could possibly wish.
('70', 302, 2, 8, 611241) This Upanishad enjoys the reputation of being part of the original Vedas.
('70', 302, 2, 9, 611315) It is the shortest Upanishad known to us.
('70', 302, 2, 10, 611357) But, as I have said, if we had only the first verse of that Upanishad remaining with us, it would be enough to supply all our wants.
('70', 302, 2, 11, 611490) Let me repeat that mantra in my faulty Sanskrit pronunciation:
('70', 302, 3, 12, 611553) Those who know a little bit of Sanskrit will find that there is nothing abstruse there that you find in other Vedic mantras, and its meaning is simply this: All that there is in this Universe, great or small, including the tiniest atom, is pervaded by God, known as Creator or Lord.
('70', 302, 3, 13, 611836) Isha means the Ruler, and He who is the Creator naturally by very right becomes the Ruler, too.
('70', 302, 3, 14, 611932) And here in this verse the seer has chosen no other epithet for the Deity but that of the Ruler, and he has excepted nothing from His jurisdiction.
('70', 302, 3, 15, 612080) He says everything that we see is pervaded by the Deity, and from that naturally the other parts of the mantra follow.
('70', 302, 3, 16, 612199) Thus he says: Renounce everything, i.e., everything that is on this Universe, the whole of the Universe, and not only this tiny globe of ours, renounce it.
('70', 302, 3, 17, 612355) He asks us to renounce it as we are such insignificant atoms that if we had any idea of possession it would seem ludicrous.
('70', 302, 3, 18, 612479) And then, says the rishi, the reward of renunciation is
('70', 302, 4, 19, 612535) i.e., enjoyment of all you need.
('70', 302, 4, 20, 612568) But there is a meaning about the word ‘enjoy’—you might as well say use, eat, etc.,—but it means that you may not take more than is necessary for your growth.
('70', 302, 4, 21, 612727) Therefore this enjoyment or use is limited by two conditions.
('70', 302, 4, 22, 612789) One is the act of renunciation or, as the author of the Bhagavata would say, enjoy in the spirit And every day in the morning everyone who believes in Bhagavata Dharma has to dedicate his thoughts, words
('70', 303, 0, 1, 612993) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 304
('70', 303, 1, 2, 613035) thoughts, words and deeds to Krishna, and not until he has performed that daily act of renunciation or dedication has he the right of touching anything or drinking even a cup of water.
('70', 303, 1, 3, 613220) And when a man has performed that act of renunciation and dedication, he derives from that act the right of eating, drinking, clothing, and housing himself to the extent necessary for his daily life.
('70', 303, 1, 4, 613420) Therefore take it as you like, either in the sense that the enjoyment or use is the reward or renunciation, or that the renunciation is the condition of enjoyment, renunciation is essential for our very existence, for our soul.
('70', 303, 1, 5, 613648) And as if that condition given in the mantra was incomplete, the rishi hastened to complete it by adding: ‘Do not covet what belongs to another’.
('70', 303, 1, 6, 613794) Now I suggest to you that the whole of the philosophy or religion found in any part of the world is contained in this mantra, and it excludes everything contrary to it.
('70', 303, 1, 7, 613963) According to the canons of interpretation, anything that is inconsistent with Shruti—and the Ishopanishad is a Shruti—is to be rejected altogether.
('70', 303, 1, 8, 614111) Now I should like to apply this mantra our own condition in virtue of the Proclamation.
('70', 303, 1, 9, 614199) Whilst I have unstintingly associated myself with your rejoicings over this great Proclamation and in tendering my thanks and congratulations to His Highness, Her Highness and their Dewan, in terms of this mantra I am obliged also to say that this Proclamation is a tardy carrying out of the behest contained in this verse of the Ishopanishad that I have recited.
('70', 303, 1, 10, 614563) Only yesterday we were unfit to call ourselves Hindus.
('70', 303, 1, 11, 614618) For if all that there is in the Universe is pervaded by God, that is to say, if the Brahmin and the Bhangi, the learned man and the scavenger, the Ezhava and the Pariah, no matter what caste they belong to—if all these are pervaded by Lord God, in the light of this mantra, there is none that is low, all are absolutely equal, equal because all are the creatures of that Creator.
('70', 303, 1, 12, 614998) And this is not a philosophical thing to be dished out to Brahmins or Kshatriyas, but it enunciates an eternal truth which admits of no reduction, no dilution 1. Therefore the Maharaja himself and the Maharani are not one whit superior to the lowliest being in Travancore.
('70', 303, 1, 13, 615271) We are all creatures and servants of one God.
('70', 303, 1, 14, 615317) If the Maharaja is the first among equals, as he is, he is so not by right of overlordship but by right of service.
('70', 303, 1, 15, 615433) And therefore how nice, how noble it is that that very Maharaja is called ‘Padmanabhadas’.
('70', 303, 1, 16, 615524) It is a proud title and I congratulate those who bestowed that title on the
('70', 303, 2, 17, 615600) 1 The source has “palliation”.
('70', 304, 0, 1, 615631) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 305
('70', 304, 1, 2, 615680) Maharaja of Travancore.
('70', 304, 1, 3, 615704) Therefore when I told you that the Maharaja or the Maharani were not one whit superior to any one of us I told you what was the actual truth accepted by their Highnesses themselves.
('70', 304, 1, 4, 615886) And if that is so, how can anyone here dare to arrogate superiority to himself or herself over any other human being?
('70', 304, 1, 5, 616004) I tell you, therefore, that if the mantra holds good, if there is any man or woman here who believes that the temples are defiled by those called avarnas, that person I declare would be guilty of a grave sin.
('70', 304, 1, 6, 616213) I tell you that the Proclamation has purified our temples of the taint that had attached to them.
('70', 304, 1, 7, 616311) I would like the mantra I have recited to be enshrined in the hearts of all our men and women and children, and if this contains, as I hold, the essence of Hinduism, it should be inscribed on the portals of every temple.
('70', 304, 1, 8, 616532) Don’t you then think that we should be belying that mantra at every step if we excluded anyone from those temples?
('70', 304, 1, 9, 616647) Therefore if you will prove yourselves deserving of the gracious Proclamation and if you will be loyal to yourselves and to those who preside over your destinies, you will carry out the letter and spirit of this Proclamation I regard it as such a great spiritual act that it ought to remove scepticism from the hearts of sceptics or doubt from the hearts of those who doubted the truth of Hinduism or religion itself.
('70', 304, 1, 10, 617065) Rightly understood this Proclamation should dispel the ignorant atheism of so called atheists.
('70', 304, 1, 11, 617160) From the date of the Proclamation the Travancore temples, which, as I once said, were not abodes of God, have become abodes of God, since no one who used to be regarded as untouchable is any more to be excluded from them.
('70', 304, 1, 12, 617382) I therefore hope and pray that throughout Travancore there may be no man or woman who will abstain from going to the temples for the reason that they have been opened to those who were regarded as Pariahs of society.

('70', 305, 11, 20, 618712) I remember you often.
('70', 305, 11, 21, 618734) I very much wanted to take you with me, but I felt that it would not be right to do so.
('70', 305, 11, 22, 618822) You must be getting letters from Nimu.
('70', 305, 11, 23, 618861) I want to reach there on the 24th.
('70', 305, 11, 24, 618896) Let us see what happens.
('70', 305, 11, 25, 618921) There it is cold; here it is terribly hot.

('70', 306, 3, 4, 619214) MUNNALAL, There is no letter from you.
('70', 306, 3, 5, 619253) You must have impressed Mirabehn.
('70', 306, 3, 6, 619287) It is an easy task.
('70', 306, 3, 7, 619307) There seems to have been some confusion regarding fruit.
('70', 306, 3, 8, 619364) The reply to this I shall get when I reach there, which I expect to do on the 24th.

('70', 306, 7, 13, 619612) January 17, 1937
('70', 306, 9, 14, 619629) Half an hour’s trip in a boat has become protracted into one of three or four hours.
('70', 306, 9, 15, 619714) I am therefore writing this on whatever paper I could lay my hands on.
('70', 306, 9, 16, 619785) When would I get again so much time to write to you if I insist on using hand made paper?
('70', 306, 9, 17, 619875) Saraswati went about with me for three days.
('70', 306, 9, 18, 619920) We spent one afternoon at Ramachandran’s father’s place.
('70', 306, 9, 19, 619977) I have talked over the matter with Saraswati and Ramachandran.
('70', 306, 9, 20, 620040) We have fully discussed about Santiniketan.
('70', 306, 9, 21, 620084) Ramachandran is not at present willing to send Saraswati to Santiniketan and he never was.
('70', 306, 9, 22, 620175) If Saraswati had continued in the Mahila Ashram, then after her course there was finished he would have agreed to send her to Santiniketan.
('70', 306, 9, 23, 620315) Now Ramachandran wishes that she should not go anywhere till she has finished her matriculation.
('70', 306, 9, 24, 620412) He told me that Saraswati was no more keen about Santiniketan.
('70', 306, 9, 25, 620475) I told both of them that if they desired that she should go to Santiniketan, I would not oppose the plan.
('70', 306, 9, 26, 620581) Ba desired that the betrothal should take place while I was here.
('70', 306, 9, 27, 620647) But Ramachandran and I felt that so long as you two were staying apart and occupied with your studies, there was no need for betrothal.
('70', 306, 9, 28, 620783) The idea, therefore, has been dropped for the present.
('70', 306, 9, 29, 620838) I see from what Ramachandran said and from my talk with Saraswati that though she is not very intelligent, she is not likely to weaken in her resolve regarding you.
('70', 306, 9, 30, 621003) The attitude of Ramachandren’s parents is the same.
('70', 306, 9, 31, 621055) I had a talk with Saraswati’s father also and saw that he was no more
('70', 307, 0, 1, 621125) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 308
('70', 307, 1, 2, 621167) opposed to the proposal.
('70', 307, 1, 3, 621192) I had asked Mahadev also to talk with him.
('70', 307, 1, 4, 621235) He has already done so.
('70', 307, 1, 5, 621259) He will write to you.
('70', 307, 1, 6, 621281) He did tell me one thing, however, that you were sensitive about every little thing, take offence even when there is no cause for any offence and hurt those who love you.
('70', 307, 1, 7, 621452) It is my complaint against you that you don’t take care of your health.
('70', 307, 1, 8, 621524) I repeatedly advise you that you should not study at the cost of your health.
('70', 307, 1, 9, 621602) Do study as much as you can but remember that good health is the first condition of happiness.
('70', 307, 1, 10, 621697) Please write to me so that I get your letter on the 24th at Wardha.
('70', 307, 1, 11, 621765) I expect to reach there on that day.

('70', 307, 5, 17, 622026) The cows here are even smaller than our cows and their milk yield is also very poor.

('70', 308, 2, 3, 622713) January 18, 1937
('70', 308, 3, 4, 622730) MANILAL AND SUSHILA, I am writing this letter at 9.30 p.m.
('70', 308, 3, 5, 622789) while crossing one of the numerous creeks in Travancore.
('70', 308, 3, 6, 622846) Half an hour’s trip has proved to be one of three hours.
('70', 308, 3, 7, 622903) Let us see when we reach our destination.
('70', 308, 3, 8, 622945) As we are not carrying hand made paper with us, I am using this.
('70', 308, 3, 9, 623010) If I don’t write now, I don’t know when again I shall be able to.
('70', 308, 3, 10, 623076) My companions are Rajkumari, Prabhavati, Mahadev, Pyarelal and Kanaiyo.
('70', 308, 3, 11, 623148) This is a real pilgrimage.
('70', 308, 3, 12, 623175) I never visited as many temples as I am doing now.
('70', 308, 3, 13, 623226) Besides, the devotion with which I visit them was not there before.
('70', 308, 3, 14, 623294) The throwing open of hundreds of temples to Harijans after the launching of the temple entry agitation for Harijans is no ordinary event.
('70', 308, 3, 15, 623432) You will read about all this in both Harijan and Harijanbandhu.
('70', 308, 3, 16, 623496) I am hoping to reach Wardha on 24th.
('70', 308, 3, 17, 623533) I hope your affairs are going on well.
('70', 308, 3, 18, 623572) Sushila, you must have recovered completely and must have found out the cause of the miscarriage.
('70', 308, 3, 19, 623670) I hope Sita also is well.
('70', 308, 3, 20, 623696) Here comes the place where we land and this letter writing must stop for the present.
('70', 308, 3, 21, 623782) Here I stop.

('70', 308, 6, 24, 623859) 339. SPEECH AT SHERTHALAI 1
('70', 308, 7, 25, 623887) January 18, 1937
('70', 308, 8, 26, 623904) It is a matter of the greatest pleasure to me to be in your midst this afternoon.
('70', 308, 8, 27, 623986) It is unnecessary for me now to say that I associate myself entirely in the expression of gratefulness to the Maharaja of Travancore.
('70', 308, 8, 28, 624120) There can be no doubt that but for his solicitude for the faith of his ancestors and but for the wise guidance of Her Highness the Maharani and the able assistance of Sachivottama.
('70', 308, 8, 29, 624301) Sir C.P. Ramaswami Aiyar, we should not have seen this Proclamation.
('70', 308, 9, 30, 624370) 1 The occasion was the Proclamation celebration organized by the S.N.D.P. Yogam, the principal Ezhava organization.
('70', 309, 0, 1, 624486) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 310
('70', 309, 1, 2, 624528) would like to repeat to you what I have said on other occasions: that if the hand that traced the signature to the Proclamation was that of the Maharaja, the spirit which moved the hand to sign it was that of God.
('70', 309, 1, 3, 624742) In spite of the brave guidance of his wise mother, the youthful ruler of Travancore might well have quailed before taking the unprecedented step of removing, by one stroke of the pen, untouchability which was double distilled in Travancore.
('70', 309, 1, 4, 624983) But whilst many things are impossible for mere man, nothing is impossible for God.
('70', 309, 1, 5, 625066) And in pursuance of the divine voice within, the Maharaja bravely took up the pen and signed the Proclamation which was drafted for him by the Sachivottama.
('70', 309, 1, 6, 625223) I would like you to look on the Proclamation as a divine gift and therefore respond to it in the spirit in which it has been given to you.
('70', 309, 2, 7, 625362) My interpretation of the Proclamation is that it removes the age long, and yet irreligious, distinction of high and low.
('70', 309, 2, 8, 625483) There is before God, whose creatures we are all, absolute equality of all.
('70', 309, 2, 9, 625558) It is man who in his arrogance has disturbed the even justice of his great Deity.
('70', 309, 2, 10, 625640) The Maharaja has now removed the taint of untouchability and declared once for all to all his subjects that all have equal rights in the matter of temple entry, and it follows that if they have equality in the matter of temple entry, they should have equality in all other matters of life.
('70', 309, 2, 11, 625930) And as I have begun to say for the last two or three days, the Proclamation is wholly consistent with the essence of Hinduism which is very briefly, but equally brilliantly, given in the first mantra of Ishopanishad.
('70', 309, 2, 12, 626147) I commend that Upanishad, or at least its first mantra, to the attention of every one of you here.
('70', 309, 2, 13, 626246) I will give you only a free translation of that mantra.
('70', 309, 2, 14, 626302) It means this: God the Ruler and Creator pervades everything that is in the Universe down to the tiniest atom.
('70', 309, 2, 15, 626413) There is nothing, without a single exception, where God is not.
('70', 309, 2, 16, 626477) And naturally therefrom follows what the seer has said in the other part of this mantra, viz., dedicate all at the feet of the Almighty or, in the language of the Gita, renounce everything.
('70', 309, 2, 17, 626667) But renunciation cannot, must not, mean suicide.
('70', 309, 2, 18, 626716) Therefore, the rishi or the seer says in the same breath: renounce or dedicate and then use or enjoy.
('70', 309, 2, 19, 626818) But he felt that he had still not given the whole essence so that even a small child could understand it.
('70', 309, 2, 20, 626924) Therefore, he wound up by saying: “Do not covet anybody’s riches”.
('70', 309, 2, 21, 626991) Therefore your use and enjoyment is limi ted in two ways.
('70', 309, 2, 22, 627049) The first condition is that we should consider nothing, not even our bodies, as our own, because we have got to dedicate or surrender everything to God the Ruler.
('70', 309, 2, 23, 627212) The second condition is that we must not steal what belongs to others.
('70', 309, 2, 24, 627283) That does not mean that we
('70', 310, 0, 1, 627310) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 311
('70', 310, 1, 2, 627359) will not, merely physically, help ourselves to what belongs to our neighbours, but that we will not even cast hungry eyes on it.
('70', 310, 1, 3, 627488) If we really want to enjoy the things we eat or the clothes we wear or the houses we live in, we must make up our minds definitely that the things are not more than we need for our sustenance and for the praise of our Maker.
('70', 310, 1, 4, 627713) Then as creatures or children of God we realize that what we eat or clothe ourselves with or live in, does not belong to us but to God.
('70', 310, 1, 5, 627849) And this advice is not given to a few chosen creatures of God, but to everyone in the world.
('70', 310, 1, 6, 627942) You will see that the dominant part of the mantra is that every atom is pervaded by God.
('70', 310, 1, 7, 628031) Therefore, the advice as to the renunciation or dedication or surrender is given to all His creatures.
('70', 310, 1, 8, 628134) It is, therefore, not as if it was a command given to a few people, but the enunciation of a universal law or universal truth.
('70', 310, 1, 9, 628261) Just imagine if all of us were to live faithfully in accordance with the great law of our being, what a happy world it would be in which we should be living.
('70', 310, 1, 10, 628419) Then there would be no mutual jealousies, no mutual strife.
('70', 310, 1, 11, 628479) And those who are blessed, if I might say so, with certain possessions would constitute themselves trustees for such of those as might want them.
('70', 310, 1, 12, 628625) In virtue of the law that I have endeavoured to explain to you, those who have much possession will use it only to the extent of their own limited requirements.
('70', 310, 1, 13, 628786) And evidently because the tradition among the Maharajas of Travancore is that they are to constitute themselves servants of Padmanabha, the practice that is in vogue today is that the Maharaja goes to the temple and dedicates himself to the Deity and as His agent and viceroy takes definite instructions to conduct his affairs from day to day.
('70', 310, 1, 14, 629130) It is perfectly true that these instructions are not given and taken as from man to man, but that even as I suggested to you, it was the spirit of God which moved the Maharaja to take this action.
('70', 310, 1, 15, 629327) Similarly if he goes to the temple for instructions in a spirit of prayer and humility, he clothes himself with the spirit of God.
('70', 310, 1, 16, 629458) I do not want, therefore, to deceive myself or you into a false belief or superstition.
('70', 310, 1, 17, 629546) Far be it from me to suggest that the Maharaja is an infallible being or that he never commits any error of judgment.
('70', 310, 1, 18, 629664) I do not know what errors of judgment he has committed if any, but assuming that he is a mortal being and, like any one of us, liable to commit errors of judgment, the fact is that he has got to live up to this mantra, and, as it is recognized in the blue blood of Travancore, that tradition requires the Maharaja from day to day to perform this act of dedication, and to the extent that he does so his acts must become infallible.
('70', 310, 1, 19, 630096) Whatever may be the
('70', 311, 0, 1, 630116) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 312
('70', 311, 1, 2, 630158) fact about the acts of the Maharaja, I have used the thing as an illustration to show how this law operates with us in India.
('70', 311, 1, 3, 630284) Consciously or unconsciously, however imperfectly, it must express itself in our acts and our lives.
('70', 311, 1, 4, 630385) Your temple going means that and nothing else or nothing less.
('70', 311, 1, 5, 630448) If you approach the temples in that spirit, you will renew yourselves day by day as you go to the temples.
('70', 311, 1, 6, 630555) And hitherto a large part of the Hindus who were deprived of the opportunities of daily surrender and dedication will get that opportunity.
('70', 311, 1, 7, 630695) The Proclamation has not removed this very great and serious discrepancy or defect.
('70', 311, 1, 8, 630779) You have done right in rejoicing over this Proclamation.
('70', 311, 1, 9, 630836) It was undoubtedly your duty to tender your loyal congratulations to Their Highnesses, but that is merely the beginning of your response to the Proclamation.
('70', 311, 1, 10, 630994) You must now realize the fullest significance and implication of this Proclamation.
('70', 311, 1, 11, 631078) You have to make a spiritual use of the opportunity given to you, and I assure you if you realize the deep spirituality of this Proclamation everything else will follow from it as day follows night.
('70', 311, 1, 12, 631277) The winter of your despair is over, the spring of your hope is now in front of you, and if you will really blossom forth and fully enjoy the fruits of the Proclamation, you will not sit idle but you will live up to the meaning I have given you of the first mantra of Ishopanishad, and what is equally important is that you will take the message of hope to those who do not even realize what the Proclamation means.
('70', 311, 1, 13, 631692) Heaven knows there may be thousands who do not realize this.
('70', 311, 1, 14, 631753) It is your duty to take the message to those less fortunate than you are.
('70', 311, 1, 15, 631827) Whatever you may have done in the past, I do hope you will not commit the fatal mistake of making any distinction between Ezhava and Pulaya, but you will resolutely make up your minds to think and act in such a manner that you will raise them to the same common platform.
('70', 311, 1, 16, 632099) I want you to believe me when I tell you that the essence of Hinduism is contained in the single mantra which I have given you.
('70', 311, 1, 17, 632227) I want you to believe me when I tell you that anything that is inconsistent with the meaning of that mantra is not Hinduism.
('70', 311, 1, 18, 632352) It does not matter in the least what other things inconsistent with the mantra are to be found in what is known as Hinduism.
('70', 311, 1, 19, 632477) I suggest to you that if you believe in this mantra, it ought to satisfy your highest aspirations.
('70', 311, 1, 20, 632576) The last time when I passed through Cochin and Travancore I had the pleasure of meeting several Ezhava friends.
('70', 311, 1, 21, 632688) Many of them were very bitter against Hinduism and Hindus.
('70', 311, 1, 22, 632747) They took pride in
('70', 312, 0, 1, 632766) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 313
('70', 312, 1, 2, 632815) describing themselves as atheists and not Hindus.
('70', 312, 1, 3, 632865) They were prepared to burn the books which passed under the name of Hindu scriptures.
('70', 312, 1, 4, 632951) I know that this Proclamation has steadied those unbelievers.
('70', 312, 1, 5, 633013) I sympathized with them at that moment as those who discussed with me will bear testimony.
('70', 312, 1, 6, 633104) They could not help being bitter and atheistic when they believed that it was the hand of the savarna that was held against the reform.
('70', 312, 1, 7, 633240) They were bound to take the savarna belief and conduct as a correct expression of the true Hindu belief, but now they know that the savarna’s heart is changed.
('70', 312, 1, 8, 633400) Therefore in passing through so many places in Travancore I have found no opposition among savarnas.
('70', 312, 1, 9, 633501) I have met during this tour tens of thousands of people and I have not known any distinction being made between man and man.
('70', 312, 1, 10, 633626) If these crowds contained thousands of erstwhile untouchables they also contained thousands of so called savarnas.
('70', 312, 1, 11, 633741) But assume for one moment that the savarna’s heart is not changed.
('70', 312, 1, 12, 633808) Our religion ought to be totally independent of the conduct of other people towards us.
('70', 312, 1, 13, 633896) For its source is derived from God within, and if we will be true to our God, we will never forsake the faith we derive from Him.
('70', 312, 1, 14, 634026) With God as our Guide, Master; Ruler in everything that we do, we may defy the whole world’s opposition and stick to our faith.
('70', 312, 1, 15, 634154) And I dare say that the mantra whose meaning I have given you is calculated to satisfy the highest aspiration of any being on earth.
('70', 312, 1, 16, 634287) May it satisfy your aspiration also and may God give you the strength to live up to it.
('70', 312, 1, 17, 634375) I thank you.

('70', 312, 4, 20, 634456) January 18, 1937
('70', 312, 5, 21, 634473) I suppose you can better imagine than I can describe my joy for being a second time in your midst and under such happy auspices as you all know.
('70', 312, 5, 22, 634618) Only a few years ago one had to struggle hard to get the roads leading to the great temple thrown open to avarna Hindus.
('70', 312, 5, 23, 634739) Good Madhavan, assisted by Krishnaswami of revered memory and by Kelappan, laid the foundation of that struggle.
('70', 312, 5, 24, 634852) It is a matter of
('70', 312, 6, 25, 634870) 1 The meeting was held in the Satyagraha Ashram ground.
('70', 312, 6, 26, 634926) According to Mahadev Desai, over twenty five thousand people attended.
('70', 313, 0, 1, 634997) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 314
('70', 313, 1, 2, 635039) deep sorrow to me—as it must be to you—that neither Madhavan nor Krishnaswami is here to share your rejoicings.
('70', 313, 1, 3, 635151) Now I am on a pilgrimage, as I have called the present tour of Travancore.
('70', 313, 1, 4, 635226) Throughout the whole course of my life I do not remember having entered so many temples as I have during these few days of pilgrimage, and only an hour more and I shall have the privilege of entering the forbidding looking walls, as they then were, which surround the great temple of this place.
('70', 313, 1, 5, 635522) And all these good things have come to pass because the Maharaja and the Maharani resolved to carry out the sacred resolve under the inspiration of Padmanabhaswami.
('70', 313, 1, 6, 635687) But the Proclamation can be rendered fully ineffective if the savarnas and avarnas of Travancore do not make an adequate response to this Proclamation.
('70', 313, 1, 7, 635839) It is not enough that the savarnas and the avarnas continue to go to the temples just as they are doing now.
('70', 313, 1, 8, 635948) Hitherto people have gone to the temples more by way of formality than from conviction.
('70', 313, 1, 9, 636036) They had not reasoned out for themselves why they needed to go to the temples.
('70', 313, 1, 10, 636115) Largely throughout India the temples have been popular more with women than men, and they have gone there in order to ask some boon of the God residing in those temples.
('70', 313, 1, 11, 636285) But now if you have rightly understood the Proclamation and all it means, I expect much more from you than a mere formal going to the temples.
('70', 313, 1, 12, 636428) In my opinion the Proclamation is a call to purification addressed to every Hindu in Travancore, whether savarna or avarna.
('70', 313, 1, 13, 636552) It was the savarnas who for a thousand years— maybe several thousand years—had deprived their own fellow religionists of the right of worshipping the same God in the same manner that they worshipped.
('70', 313, 1, 14, 636752) And in order to justify such an atrocious injustice—no matter for what causes—a whole class of human beings were held as untouchables.
('70', 313, 1, 15, 636887) Now that the sinful distinction has been abolished by a stroke of the pen, in order that you may render some reparation to avarna Hindus you have got to adopt some measure to let them know that you are no longer the superior beings that you have claimed to be all these years.
('70', 313, 1, 16, 637164) Therefore I would expect all savarnas to take the glorious message of liberation to every avarna home.
('70', 313, 1, 17, 637267) It can be done very easily and without much effort on your part.
('70', 313, 1, 18, 637332) Only one condition is indispensable.
('70', 313, 1, 19, 637369) You should believe from the bottom of your heart in the necessity of the Proclamation and every Hindu—savarna and avarna, man and woman—should make it his or her individual work to get hold of some avarnas, to take to them the message of the Proclamation and
('70', 314, 0, 1, 637628) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 315
('70', 314, 1, 2, 637677) take them to the temples.
('70', 314, 1, 3, 637703) And since the spiritual regeneration of an individual or a nation must include all the departments of life— economic, religious, social,—uplift in those departments is bound to follow.
('70', 314, 1, 4, 637888) You will be vastly mistaken if you labour under the delusion that all these things are going to be done by the Proclamation.
('70', 314, 2, 5, 638013) I think that the Maharaja’s and the Maharani’s task is finished, so far as untouchability is concerned, by issuing this Proclamation.
('70', 314, 2, 6, 638147) That there would be financial aid by the State for the education of these classes is a foregone conclusion.
('70', 314, 2, 7, 638255) But that can never bring about the regeneration that I am picturing to myself.
('70', 314, 2, 8, 638334) That requires a hearty and willing co operation of the savarna Hindus as a class.
('70', 314, 2, 9, 638416) You can therefore understand my sorrow when I heard—I do not know with what truth—that some women and even men were hesitating to enter the temple which they used to do regularly.
('70', 314, 2, 10, 638596) In order to disabuse such doubters, if there are any here, of their doubts, I want to quote one historical fact that took place when I was here in connection with [the] Vaikom Satyagraha.
('70', 314, 2, 11, 638784) Some of you may remember that I had more than one serious discussion with the Shastris who were then residing within the temple precincts, and who were attached, if I remember rightly, to the temple in some shape or other.
('70', 314, 2, 12, 639007) I am trying to give you as correct a version of that discussion as I can recall at the present moment.
('70', 314, 2, 13, 639110) In support of the proposition that even roads leading to the temples were barred against avarna Hindus although they were not barred against non Hindus, they produced a book called Shankara Smriti.
('70', 314, 2, 14, 639308) I had never heard of such a Smriti before I came to Vaikom and heard it quoted.
('70', 314, 2, 15, 639388) You will be astonished to find that when I had that Smriti translated for me, I could not find in it any authority for closing the roads.
('70', 314, 2, 16, 639526) But I grant that it was enough for them that they believed that the Shankara Smriti supported their contention.
('70', 314, 2, 17, 639638) Then, as I was negotiating through the then Commissioner of Police and with the Senior Maharani, I just asked the question that supposing result of the negotiations the Maharani issued orders to open the roads to the avarna Hindus, what would be their attitude to them?
('70', 314, 2, 18, 639908) Then without the slightest hesitation they said: ‘Oh!
('70', 314, 2, 19, 639962) that is a different thing altogether; a Hindu Prince or Princess has every right to issue an order which has the authority of a Smriti!’ They said that was implied in Hinduism as Hindu kings are repositories of Hindu faith and they
('70', 315, 0, 1, 640194) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 316
('70', 315, 1, 2, 640236) have every right to issue orders which are not inconsistent with Shruti.
('70', 315, 1, 3, 640309) I asked them whether the same thing applied to the opening of the temples.
('70', 315, 1, 4, 640384) They said, ‘Most decidedly.’ Let me tell you that these shastris were not the only shastris that gave this reply.
('70', 315, 1, 5, 640498) I asked the same question to shastris in Cochin and Tamilnad and they gave the same answer.
('70', 315, 1, 6, 640590) As a matter of fact that is the historical evolution of Smritis and for that matter of the eighteen Puranas.
('70', 315, 1, 7, 640699) They were all produced or inspired in response to the want of those times.
('70', 315, 1, 8, 640774) They do not always express eternal verities.
('70', 315, 1, 9, 640819) The eternal verity is summed up in one verse of the Ishopanishad as I have been saying.
('70', 315, 1, 10, 640907) And without fear of contradiction I am here to say that every believer in this verse is wholly a Hindu, and if he acts up to what is taught by this mantra he will find his freedom here and hereafter.
('70', 315, 1, 11, 641107) I know no other road or better road to happiness than is contained in this first mantra of Ishopanishad.
('70', 315, 1, 12, 641212) And if a Hindu Prince, in conformity with the implications and teaching of this mantra, issued a Proclamation, such as has been issued by the Maharaja of Travancore, it would carry such authority.
('70', 315, 1, 13, 641409) And I invite those who know anything of the Ishapanishad to tell me whether this Proclamation is in any way inconsistent with this mantra.
('70', 315, 1, 14, 641548) If they will make a prayerful search within and examine it, they will find that the Proclamation is a tardy fulfilment of its requirements.
('70', 315, 1, 15, 641688) Therefore with all the earnestness that I can command I want to ask every doubter—man and woman—to throw away those doubts and heartily respond to the Proclamation.
('70', 315, 1, 16, 641853) I must not take this theme any further, as I want to introduce another subject.
('70', 315, 1, 17, 641933) I shall conclude this part by hoping that the Proclamation will have your hearty, not lukewarm, support and that you will carry it out in letter and spirit.
('70', 315, 1, 18, 642090) And now I want to take you all on the wings of your imagination to Cochin.
('70', 315, 1, 19, 642165) I have come to the borders of Cochin, as far as it was possible, and I understand on the other side of the waters at a distance of less than ten miles lies Cochin.
('70', 315, 1, 20, 642329) I suppose the last time I came to Vaikom I came through Cochin.
('70', 315, 1, 21, 642393) But since I am not going to Cochin, I may permit myself to refer to Cochin which is so intimately connected with Travancore.
('70', 315, 1, 22, 642518) Conditions in both the States are identical and the practices and usages in the two States are the same.
('70', 315, 1, 23, 642623) I understand that the Maharaja of Cochin has even some rights and privileges with regard to the Vaikom temple.
('70', 315, 1, 24, 642734) I must confess to you
('70', 316, 0, 1, 642756) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 317
('70', 316, 1, 2, 642805) that I am impatient to see that the Cochin Maharaja follows in the footsteps of the Maharaja of Travancore.
('70', 316, 1, 3, 642913) I have no desire whatsover to embarrass His Highness.
('70', 316, 1, 4, 642967) I am myself an old man—awaiting any day the warrant of Yamaraja 1. The Maharaja is older than I by six years.
('70', 316, 1, 5, 643077) I assure you that whilst I am overjoyed over the Proclamation and the celebrations in Travancore, I am oppressed by the responsibility which touches every savarna Hindu—not that it devolves any the less on the devoted heads of avarna Hindus.
('70', 316, 1, 6, 643319) Only just now what I want to be done has got to be done, and can only be done, by the savarna Hindus.
('70', 316, 1, 7, 643421) I want you to adopt a respectful and prayerful attitude towards the old Maharaja of Cochin.
('70', 316, 1, 8, 643513) But with due regard to his age and rank, we should be false to the faith we hold in common with him, we should be false to truth, if we did not convey to him our deepest wishes.
('70', 316, 1, 9, 643691) I claim to have understood the tenets of Hinduism and for an unbroken period of 50 years followed them as far as an imperfect being like me can.
('70', 316, 1, 10, 643836) And when I have repeated from every platform that untouchability is a blot on Hinduism I have weighed every word of it and I have based my opposition to untouchability on the Hindu Shastras and nothing else.
('70', 316, 1, 11, 644044) Therefore I venture to convey to the Maharaja of Cochin that what the Maharaja of Travancore guided by his mother has done is no new fangled venture of a youthful sovereign.
('70', 316, 1, 12, 644218) I verily believe that when all else about Travancore is forgotten, this one act of the Maharaja will be remembered by future generations with gratitude.
('70', 316, 1, 13, 644371) I hold that this Proclamation must not begin and end with the border of Travancore.
('70', 316, 1, 14, 644455) Then let me give you a little tip.
('70', 316, 1, 15, 644490) I want you to be at Cochin in imagination.
('70', 316, 1, 16, 644533) That means that your conduct should affect the decision of the Maharaja of Cochin.
('70', 316, 1, 17, 644616) How can this be done?
('70', 316, 1, 18, 644638) By prayerful and religious spirit, as expressed in your own individual conduct, you can influence His Highness.
('70', 316, 1, 19, 644750) I do not suggest sending petitions to the Maharaja of Cochin.
('70', 316, 1, 20, 644812) Petitions may be submitted by the people of Cochin, but you the people of Travancore can do something better.
('70', 316, 1, 21, 644922) Old men are never moved from their purpose by appeals to the intellect.
('70', 316, 1, 22, 644994) I tell you there are many young men after me to convert me to their views, and they find that they cannot easily take me with them.
('70', 316, 1, 23, 645126) But the hearts of old men become increasingly responsive with age and so whenever young men or young women want me to do anything they have to get round not my intellect or reason but my heart.
('70', 316, 1, 24, 645320) So also must it happen to the old Maharaja of Cochin, and you

('70', 317, 0, 1, 645397) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 318
('70', 317, 1, 2, 645439) can touch his heart, not through any newspaper propaganda, but by becoming better Hindus under the liberties granted by the Proclamation, by showing that you savarna Hindus have not lost a title of your religious fervour, nor have the temples a tittle of the sanctity attached to them by the readmission of avarnas to them.
('70', 317, 1, 3, 645763) I have so often said, and certainly held the belief, that our temples were losing their sanctity by reason of our criminal neglect of our untouchable brethren.
('70', 317, 1, 4, 645923) If you realize your responsibility under the Proclamation, you will at once think with me that you cannot be indifferent to what temples mean to you and whether you go there or no.
('70', 317, 1, 5, 646104) And when the best of you continue to go to the temples and see to it that temples undergo a process of regeneration and the life of avarnas becomes purified, no Maharaja can help being moved by such a spectacle.
('70', 317, 1, 6, 646316) I tell you if you have really understood the spirit of the Proclamation, the silent revolution that the Hindu life will undergo in Travancore will be irresistible and will overtake not only Cochin but every corner of Hindustan.
('70', 317, 1, 7, 646544) May God grant that even as the foundation of temple entry in Travancore was laid in this place by humble workers like Madhavan and the late Krishnaswami and Kelappan, may God grant that you people of Vaikom will lay the foundation of the purification of Hinduism, and thus induce the Maharaja of Cochin to open all the temples in his State and thus render an equally great service to Hinduism with the Maharaja of Travancore.

('70', 317, 4, 10, 647033) [January 18, 1937] 2
('70', 317, 5, 11, 647054) I have not been a temple goer but now that this liberty has come to me all of a sudden, I feel fascinated, and the divine stillness that surrounded the prayer meeting under the ashwattha tree in the temple yard now stimulates me to find new ways and means for attracting people to temples.
('70', 317, 5, 12, 647344) My temple going is not an idle thing.
('70', 317, 5, 13, 647382) It is a definitely sacred thing that has come to me in my life at an opportune moment.
('70', 317, 6, 14, 647469) QUSTION: Would you say anything about the mode of worship?
('70', 317, 7, 15, 647528) 1 The trustee in question had earlier opposed the opening of temples to Harijans.
('70', 317, 7, 16, 647610) Now he had come to express his satisfaction over what had happened.

('70', 318, 1, 2, 647766) ANSWER: I will not criticize it.
('70', 318, 1, 3, 647799) The new thing has come upon me with a newness which humbles me.
('70', 318, 1, 4, 647863) I refuse to look at it with the eye of a critic.
('70', 318, 1, 5, 647912) One thing certainly I have noticed, viz., the want of intelligence and devoutness on the part of priests.

('70', 318, 4, 8, 648071) January 19, 1937
('70', 318, 5, 9, 648088) I am deeply grateful to you for your beautifully worded Sanskrit address and the gift of the bark tree cloth.
('70', 318, 5, 10, 648198) I cannot say that I am going to wear this cloth.
('70', 318, 5, 11, 648247) For one thing it is too dear for me to wear, but it will adorn the museum that we have set up in Maganwadi containing specimens of village crafts.
('70', 318, 5, 12, 648394) As I was being taken round the temple and as I approached the central part of the temple, I had a Pulaya boy shown to me, and he boldly mounted up the steps with me.
('70', 318, 5, 13, 648560) A few months ago, I should not have considered such a thing possible in my lifetime, but what often is impossible for man is easily possible for God to fulfil.
('70', 318, 5, 14, 648720) And as I said last night and have repeated at several meetings, I see in this Proclamation the spirit of God working through the hand of the Maharaja.
('70', 318, 5, 15, 648871) As a man, however highly placed he was, he could not have possibly worked the wonders that I see about me in Travancore.
('70', 318, 5, 16, 648992) If he was a perfect autocrat, heedless of the feeling of his people, he could have issued this Proclamation, but he could by that act no more have touched your hearts than I could have by sending this Proclamation to you.
('70', 318, 5, 17, 649214) He could not have made tens of thousands of savarnas brush shoulders with the so called avarnas and go to the temples in a prayerful mood.
('70', 318, 5, 18, 649353) For this change of heart—for I cannot call this thing by any other name—only God is responsible.
('70', 318, 5, 19, 649450) Was I not here only a few years ago and did I not see the hardened features of thousands of people whom I could not move from the citadel of untouchability?
('70', 318, 5, 20, 649607) That citadel at that time seemed to me to be harder than the hardest steel.
('70', 318, 5, 21, 649683) And had I not a living faith in God, I should have despaired of your hearts ever being touched.
('70', 318, 5, 22, 649779) But evidently the age of miracles is not gone.
('70', 318, 5, 23, 649826) And I see today those very hard hearts having melted.
('70', 318, 5, 24, 649880) I met last night a Nambudiri Shastri, intimately connected with the Vaikom temple, who, as I saw during our conversation, was the old friend with whom I had discussions during the Temple entry Satyagraha at
('70', 319, 0, 1, 650087) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 320
('70', 319, 1, 2, 650129) Vaikom.
('70', 319, 1, 3, 650137) And I asked him whether he could confirm the conversation between him and me which took place then and which I recalled during my speech last evening.
('70', 319, 1, 4, 650288) Well, in a few years’ time, that old man’s heart has melted like snow under the Travancore sun, and he and I, instead of finding ourselves in opposite camps, found ourselves last night congratulating the Government upon the Proclamation.
('70', 319, 1, 5, 650526) But congratulations are not enough.
('70', 319, 1, 6, 650562) It would have been monstrous if you had not tendered congratulations to both the Maharaja and the Maharani.
('70', 319, 1, 7, 650670) It is not enough that on an occasion like this thousands of you gather and without any distinction go to the people.
('70', 319, 1, 8, 650787) This expression of joy, this meeting of savarnas’ and avarnas’ hearts must not be a matter of momentary enthusiasm.
('70', 319, 1, 9, 650903) The process must be continued with redoubled vigour so that nobody would have the misfortune of describing Travancore as a land possessing unapproachables, invisibles and what not.
('70', 319, 1, 10, 651084) The literature dealing with Pulaya and Pariah should be a thing of the past, to be recalled, if it is ever to be recalled, as relics of the past.
('70', 319, 1, 11, 651230) And I assure you that this Proclamation will fail of its purpose if this change is not brought about in every department of life.
('70', 319, 1, 12, 651360) The Maharaja and the Maharani have done their task.
('70', 319, 1, 13, 651412) It is now reserved for you, the savarna men and women of Travancore, to go down to them whom we have persecuted as the outcastes of society, to fraternize with them and own them as members of our families.
('70', 319, 1, 14, 651618) It must be heart felt, real, genuine acceptance, without mental reservations, of the Proclamation.
('70', 319, 1, 15, 651717) It must not be allowed to become a dead letter.
('70', 319, 1, 16, 651765) It is not meant to be a dead letter.
('70', 319, 1, 17, 651802) From the heart to heart conversations that I had the privilege of having with the Maharani and the Maharaja and the Dewan, I know they want it to be given full effect to.
('70', 319, 1, 18, 651973) Take this, therefore, as an honest and herculean effort to purify Hinduism.
('70', 319, 1, 19, 652049) That process of purification is no one man’s concern.
('70', 319, 1, 20, 652103) It is the individual concern of every one of you here.
('70', 319, 1, 21, 652158) May God give you enough strength for fulfilling the purpose behind the Proclamation.

('70', 320, 2, 3, 652351) January 19, 1937
('70', 320, 3, 4, 652368) There is a special joy that I am experiencing this morning, having come to this temple and having seen what I have seen.
('70', 320, 3, 5, 652489) I was duly prepared for this upliftment.
('70', 320, 3, 6, 652530) I was told that this was one of the oldest and most important of private temples, that it was the sole property of the Nambudiris, and that when this temple was declared open, people thought that there remained nothing now to be done in connection with temple entry.
('70', 320, 3, 7, 652797) But when I came here and saw what I did see, the joy which was reserved for me was considerably enhanced.
('70', 320, 3, 8, 652903) Here behind me is the trustee of the temple who took me to the temple with great affection.
('70', 320, 3, 9, 652995) For this I was not unprepared, because it has been my rare good fortune to experience that personal affection throughout this pilgrimage.
('70', 320, 3, 10, 653133) But what gladdened my heart was to see that he invited the so called avarnas to come and enter the gates before he took me.
('70', 320, 3, 11, 653257) And it did not appear to me an artificial act, but perfectly natural.
('70', 320, 3, 12, 653327) Nowhere else has it happened like that during these seven days of my pilgrimage.
('70', 320, 3, 13, 653408) Of course I do not notice the omission anywhere, for the so called avarnas, or as I call them by the term of endearment ‘Harijans’, mixed freely with the others, and there was nothing more required by way of coaxing them to go into the temples.
('70', 320, 3, 14, 653653) But it was most striking for me to observe that here our friend the trustee would not be satisfied until he drew the hesitating avarnas and brought them to my notice.
('70', 320, 3, 15, 653820) I felt then that this was really the proper manner of giving effect to the Proclamation.
('70', 320, 3, 16, 653909) The Proclamation does not say that the hitherto proud Nambudiris should take avarnas by their arms and give them the place of preference in the temples.
('70', 320, 3, 17, 654062) Of course I own that the spirit of the Proclamation demands what this friend has done this morning, but then no prince can possibly dictate to the hearts of his people.
('70', 320, 3, 18, 654231) All responses from the heart must be in their very nature spontaneous, and in this, for him, very natural act of expression of brotherhood I saw a proper fulfilment of the spirit of the Proclamation.
('70', 320, 3, 19, 654431) My joy was further enhanced by my knowledge that Nambudiris occupy in this State, as in Cochin, a place of pride and privilege.
('70', 320, 3, 20, 654559) If they even showed secret, sullen opposition to the Proclamation, it could be rendered ineffective.
('70', 320, 4, 21, 654660) 1 Delivered on the occasion of the opening to Harijans of a private Nambudiri temple, about two thousand years old, to which Gandhiji was specially invited
('70', 321, 0, 1, 654816) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 322
('70', 321, 1, 2, 654858) But here in this private temple, the stronghold of orthodox Nambudiris, the Proclamation is evidently being carried out both in letter and spirit.
('70', 321, 2, 3, 655005) I must here tell you a little secret.
('70', 321, 2, 4, 655043) I tell you that I was most disinclined to visit Travancore and it required much effort on the part of Sjts.
('70', 321, 2, 5, 655151) Govindan and Ramachandran to draw me out of Segaon, and at one time it seemed as though all their labours would be in vain.
('70', 321, 2, 6, 655275) But things happened to melt my heart and I am being led, as a docile man or woman may be led, by the nose by Ramachandran and company.
('70', 321, 2, 7, 655410) But the heartening experience that I have undergone here tells me that it would have been a stupid act of foolishness on my part if I had not visited Travancore, if only to see this temple and to see Harijans being led into it.
('70', 321, 2, 8, 655638) Let this be an example to all Nambudiris and other savarnas to follow.
('70', 321, 2, 9, 655709) That is a very fair illustration of what I mean when I say at so many meetings that the Proclamation is to be carried out in its full effect by the savarnas.
('70', 321, 2, 10, 655867) You must know that the avarna Hindus, except those who have undergone training, do not know what the Proclamation is and what it means for them.
('70', 321, 2, 11, 656012) The burden of drawing them out of the ghettos, to which our ignorance and folly have confined them, and letting them see the sunlight which is meant for all, and letting their hearts be warmed up by being led to the temples, lies on the savarnas.
('70', 321, 2, 12, 656259) Let it not be said of Travancoreans that what Nambudiris who are supposed to be the highest caste in Travancore did, others failed to do.
('70', 321, 2, 13, 656397) This burden of drawing the avarna brethren and sisters out of their dens depends no less on savarna women than on men.
('70', 321, 2, 14, 656516) I do hope and pray that all savarna Hindus of Travancore will carry out the Proclamation to the fullest extent and deserve to be called the liberators of Hinduism, if not its saviours.

('70', 321, 5, 18, 656763) January 19, 1937
('70', 321, 6, 19, 656780) I am told that this place was the scene of satyagraha and suffering.
('70', 321, 6, 20, 656849) Whatever sufferings were gone through can be recalled with pleasure, now that the Proclamation has brought delight which the satyagrahis had not expected at the time they were going through suffering.
('70', 321, 6, 21, 657050) I have no time today to give you a long speech nor do you need a long speech from me.
('70', 321, 6, 22, 657136) All I had to say, all I could say, has been
('70', 322, 0, 1, 657180) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 323
('70', 322, 1, 2, 657229) mostly said already, but this I cannot help saying that if you are to reap the rich fruits of the Proclamation, every one of you individually will have to work for it.
('70', 322, 1, 3, 657397) This Proclamation ought not to be allowed to remain, as many rules and regulations are allowed to remain in their portfolios.
('70', 322, 1, 4, 657523) This Proclamation is a charter of freedom to all avarnas and it washes out the sins of savarnas against avarnas.
('70', 322, 1, 5, 657636) But it can only wash out these sins if the savarnas realize the full significance of the Proclamation.
('70', 322, 1, 6, 657739) Therefore the savarnas should fraternize with the avarnas, not for demonstration but from their very hearts.
('70', 322, 1, 7, 657848) You will then find that Travancore will be a place of pilgrimage for all the Hindus of India and it will also be a great landmark in the history of Hinduism.
('70', 322, 1, 8, 658006) The burden of taking the message of Hinduism to everyone rests on the broad shoulders of savarnas; and remember that you will fail to do so unless your hearts respond to the Proclamation.
('70', 322, 1, 9, 658194) May God give you the wisdom and strength to do so.

('70', 322, 4, 12, 658333) January 19, 1937
('70', 322, 5, 13, 658350) Bishop Moore received Gandhiji cordially and welcomed the Temple entry Proclamation as an important event.
('70', 322, 5, 14, 658457) He inquired if the savarnas and Brahmins also welcomed it, or if there was any opposition on their part.
('70', 322, 6, 15, 658562) Gandhiji said he had seen no signs of opposition.
('70', 322, 6, 16, 658612) He had met several thousands of people, visited several temples, and had found savarnas and avarnas entering the temples in perfect friendliness.
('70', 322, 7, 17, 658758) Bishop Abraham asked if the Ezhavas were ready to treat the Depressed Classes of lower castes on terms of equality.
('70', 322, 8, 18, 658874) Gandhiji said he could not reply with confidence but he was striving to emphasize that point everywhere, and he hoped that the Proclamation would be carried out in that spirit.
('70', 322, 9, 19, 659051) Bishop Moore .
('70', 322, 9, 20, 659066) said that he had heard that Mr. Gandhi was disturbed over reports of Christian missionary work in Travancore, and that he was ready to remove any misunderstanding that it was possible for him to remove.
('70', 322, 10, 21, 659269) Gandhiji said that he was indeed surprised at the report of conversions of thousands of people in the Telugu country and in Travancore made in Bishop Pickett’s
('70', 322, 11, 22, 659429) 1 The interview took place at Bishop Moore’s house at Kottayam.
('70', 322, 11, 23, 659493) The object was to clear up misunderstandings.
('70', 323, 0, 1, 659539) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 324
('70', 323, 1, 2, 659581) speech in England and in a statement of the Church Missionary Society appealing for funds over the signature of Prebendary Cash.
('70', 323, 1, 3, 659710) He could not understand how responsible Christians could make extravagant statements to the effect that thousands had experienced a spiritual awakening and accepted the Gospel.
('70', 323, 1, 4, 659887) The Bishop of Dornakal had even stated that those thousands included not only the Depressed Classes but a large number of so called high caste Hindus.
('70', 323, 1, 5, 660038) Gandhiji said he had challenged the truth of these statements in the columns of Harijan 1 and had invited them to prove that he was wrong.
('70', 323, 1, 6, 660177) He had also met leaders working in Andhra and asked them to make inquiries into the truth of these extravagant statements.
('70', 323, 1, 7, 660300) Bishop Moore confessed that he had not read either the appeal for funds or Bishop Pickett’s speech and could not, therefore, express any opinion thereon.
('70', 323, 1, 8, 660454) He was quite sure, however, that no responsible missionary journal should ever publish statements that were not based on actual facts, and he wanted to assure Mr. Gandhi that no wrong information had ever been supplied from his diocese for which alone he could speak.
('70', 323, 1, 9, 660722) During the last year they could record 530 persons as having been baptized into the Anglican faith.
('70', 323, 1, 10, 660822) Bishop Abraham said he had been to the Andhra country and had seen with his own eyes that there was a tremendous awakening there even among the middle class savarnas .
('70', 323, 1, 11, 660990) he had addressed meetings which were attended by many of the high caste people.
('70', 323, 2, 12, 661070) GANDHIJI: But that means nothing.
('70', 323, 2, 13, 661104) Hundreds of students attend meetings addressed by Dr. Stanley Jones, but they cannot be said to seek conversion to Christianity.
('70', 323, 2, 14, 661233) To say that hundreds attended meetings addressed by Christian preachers is very different from saying that hundreds have accepted the message of Jesus and from making an appeal for money in anticipation of people becoming Christians in large numbers.
('70', 323, 3, 15, 661484) Mr. Kuruvilla here put in whether Mr.Gandhi had any objection to their stimulating and responding to the spiritual hunger of people.
('70', 323, 3, 16, 661617) Gandhiji said it was wholly irrelevant to the issue.
('70', 323, 3, 17, 661670) Bishop Abraham said they were responding to the spiritual hunger of the people.
('70', 323, 3, 18, 661750) Mr. Gandhi could have no objection to that?
('70', 323, 3, 19, 661794) Gandhiji said he could have no objection to responding to spiritual hunger, provided it was genuinely felt and expressed.
('70', 323, 3, 20, 661916) But the matter was quite irrelevant to the discussion which was entirely about extravagant statements made by responsible people.
('70', 323, 3, 21, 662046) He said to Bishop Moore that he would furnish him with a copy of the C.M.S. statement and he would like to know what Bishop Moore would have to say regarding it.

('70', 324, 2, 3, 662359) January 19, 1937
('70', 324, 3, 4, 662376) I am delighted to address for the first time during my pilgrim age a women’s meeting.
('70', 324, 3, 5, 662462) I should therefore have given you much longer time and tried to make fuller acquaintance of you who have gathered together in such a larger number and where, for the first time, a sister has made her reception speech in Hindi.
('70', 324, 3, 6, 662689) I thank you both for the welcome and for the Hindi address.
('70', 324, 3, 7, 662749) I shall rest content with saying a few words on the Proclamation.
('70', 324, 3, 8, 662815) Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, who will speak to you after I have done, will address herself to women’s problems as you may know that she is the Secretary of the All India Women’s Conference.
('70', 324, 3, 9, 662998) I have often said that untouchability is a great blot on Hinduism and one that threatened the very life of Hinduism.
('70', 324, 3, 10, 663115) The Proclamation has come in very good time to enable us to wipe out the blot.
('70', 324, 3, 11, 663194) But by itself it cannot do so.
('70', 324, 3, 12, 663225) The Maharaja’s work was finished with the Proclamation.
('70', 324, 3, 13, 663281) It is for you to root out untouchability by carrying the Proclamation into full effect.
('70', 324, 3, 14, 663369) This work of carrying through the process of purification devolves principally on savarna Hindus.
('70', 324, 3, 15, 663467) I have often said that it is women alone who can be protectors of religion in as much as they are the custodians of the purity of the people.
('70', 324, 3, 16, 663609) It is particularly women’s work because the purification of religion is ultimately a matter of the purification of one’s heart.
('70', 324, 3, 17, 663737) And if the women have realized the true spirit of the Proclamation, they can give better effect to it then men.
('70', 324, 3, 18, 663849) We have up to now regarded avarnas as untouchables, not only in our homes and our temples, but in our hearts.
('70', 324, 3, 19, 663959) We have to regard them as our own kith and kin.
('70', 324, 3, 20, 664007) If, therefore, there is anyone amongst you who thinks that the Maharaja has defiled the Hindu religion and the temples by issuing this Proclamation, she will err against humanity and her Maker.
('70', 324, 3, 21, 664201) I must tell you that these temples were impure so long as the temple doors were closed against Harijans.
('70', 324, 3, 22, 664306) This Proclamation has purified them all.
('70', 324, 3, 23, 664347) None of you will, therefore, cease to go to these temples in the belief that they have been defiled.
('70', 324, 3, 24, 664448) I hope that you will discard that superstition and fraternize with Harijan women and actively help in raising them to a level of social equality with you.

('70', 325, 2, 3, 664757) January 19, 1937 I know that this great assemblage is one of the many signs of rejoicings over the Proclamation which H.H. the Maharaja has given to the people of Travancore.
('70', 325, 2, 4, 664932) Whilst it was but natural and your duty to tender congratulations to Their Highnesses and the Dewan, it would be wholly wrong if you exhausted your effort with these celebrations.
('70', 325, 2, 5, 665112) Let your congratulations Their Highnesses be an earnest of your determination to make every effort to make the Proclamation as successful as human effort can make it.
('70', 325, 2, 6, 665279) As I have suggested at various gatherings, the main burden of successfully working out the Proclamation must fall on the shoulders of those who have been regarded as savarnas.
('70', 325, 2, 7, 665455) It is they who have to carry the message of liberation and hope to the desolate homes of those who are miscalled avarnas.
('70', 325, 2, 8, 665577) It is their privilege and their duty to approach the humble huts of the so called avarna brothers and sisters and take the message to them in a humble and prayerful mood.
('70', 325, 2, 9, 665748) That would be some measure, however tardy, of reparation for wrongs done to those whom we have suppressed.
('70', 325, 2, 10, 665855) It is and should be their proud privilege to stoop in order to raise those whom they have helped to sink lower and lower from day to day.
('70', 325, 2, 11, 665993) So much today for the savarna Hindus.
('70', 325, 2, 12, 666031) I know Kottayam is a stronghold of the Christians of Travancore.
('70', 325, 2, 13, 666096) Christians know there is between them and me an invisible but unbreakable bond.
('70', 325, 2, 14, 666176) I venture, therefore, to suggest to Indian Christians, whether they are born Christians or have been converted to Christianity, that they too may not stand aside but take part in advancing the cause that the Proclamation implies.
('70', 325, 2, 15, 666406) And as briefly as possible I propose to tell you what I mean.
('70', 325, 2, 16, 666468) That document abolishes all distinctions between high and low that reigned supreme in Travancore as in other parts of India.
('70', 325, 2, 17, 666593) If a human document can raise by a stroke of the pen all avarnas to the status of the savarnas— and this Proclamation does really do so—then the Christians in the State owe a duty to the Hindus which they dare not neglect.
('70', 325, 2, 18, 666816) If you believe with me, as I know a large body of Christian opinion today does believe, that all the principal religions of the world are true, then you will aid savarna Hindus in the process of penitence and reparation they are expected to go through under the Proclamation.
('70', 325, 3, 19, 667092) 1 The meeting was held in front of the Krishna temple and was attended by about 1,000 people.
('70', 325, 3, 20, 667186) The Hindu, 20 1 1937, also carried a report of the speech.
('70', 326, 0, 1, 667245) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 327
('70', 326, 1, 2, 667294) It undoubtedly grieved me when some of the Depressed Classes felt in disgust towards Hinduism like going out of Hinduism and embracing some other faith.
('70', 326, 1, 3, 667447) It was a matter of equal grief to me to hear of efforts made by people belonging to different faiths to catch, as it were, the Depressed Classees and remove them from the faith to which they have belonged for centuries.
('70', 326, 1, 4, 667667) If you believe, as I know some do, that Hinduism is nothing but a body of hideous usages and superstitions, that Hinduism is a fraud upon humanity, then you cannot render better service to the avarna and savarna Hindus than by exposing this ‘fraud’.
('70', 326, 1, 5, 667917) In the estimation of those who so believe, this Proclamation is an act which it would be their duty to resist and to show to the Maharaja that by issuing the Proclamation of liberation he is simply prolonging the agony and giving a new lease of life to a body of superstitions which were bound to die their natural death.
('70', 326, 1, 6, 668239) But I know many Christians throughout the length and breadth of India do not regard Hinduism as a fraud upon humanity or a body of bad usages and superstitions.
('70', 326, 1, 7, 668400) A religion which has produced Ramakrishna, Chaitanya, Shankara and Vivekanand cannot be a body of superstitions.
('70', 326, 1, 8, 668513) As you know, and if you do not know it I want to declare, that I personally hold all principal religions of the world to be not only true but also to be equal.
('70', 326, 1, 9, 668673) I have endeavoured to study the Bible with the eyes of a devout Christian and the Koran with the eyes of a devout Mussalman, and I have not hesitated to assimilate whatever I have found to be good in both these scriptures.
('70', 326, 1, 10, 668896) I have studied other scriptures of the world also.
('70', 326, 1, 11, 668947) But I have singled these out for the sake of illustration.
('70', 326, 1, 12, 669006) But, you might well ask, if I declare all these religions to be equally true and equally demanding my respect, what is the meaning of my remaining a Hindu?
('70', 326, 1, 13, 669162) I shall tell you why.
('70', 326, 1, 14, 669184) Latterly I have been endeavouring to describe to vast assemblages of men and women I have addressed what I regard as the essence of Hinduism, and I have been suggesting to them one incredibly simple mantra of the Ishopanishad and, as you know, it is one of the Upanishads that enjoy the sanctity of the Vedas.
('70', 326, 1, 15, 669494) The very first verse of the Ishopanishad means simply this: God pervades everything that is to be found in this universe down to the tiniest atom.
('70', 326, 1, 16, 669641) The mantra describes God as the Creator, the Ruler and the Lord.
('70', 326, 1, 17, 669706) The seer to whom this mantra or verse was revealed was not satisfied with the magnificent statement that God was to be found everywhere.
('70', 326, 1, 18, 669843) But he went further and said:‘Since God pervades everything nothing belongs to you, not even your own body.
('70', 327, 0, 1, 669951) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 328
('70', 327, 1, 2, 669993) the undisputed, unchallengeable Master of everything you possess.’ And so when a person who calls himself a Hindu goes through the process of regeneration or a second birth, as Christians would call it, he has to perform a dedication or renunciation of all that he has in ignorance called his own property.
('70', 327, 1, 3, 670300) And then when he has performed this act of dedication or renunciation, he is told that he will win a reward in the shape of God taking good care of what he will require for food, clothing or housing.
('70', 327, 1, 4, 670500) Therefore the condition of enjoyment or use of the necessaries of life is their dedication or renunciation.
('70', 327, 1, 5, 670608) And that dedication or renunciation has got to be done from day to day, lest we may in this busy world forget the central fact of life.
('70', 327, 1, 6, 670744) And to crown all, the seer says: ‘Covet not anybody’s riches.’ I suggest to you that the truth that is embedded in this very short mantra is calculated to satisfy the highest cravings of every human being— whether they have reference to this world or to the next.
('70', 327, 1, 7, 671008) I have in my search of the scriptures of the world found nothing to add to this mantra.
('70', 327, 1, 8, 671096) Looking back upon all the little I have read of the scriptures—it is precious little I confess—I feel that everything good in all the scriptures is derived from this mantra.
('70', 327, 1, 9, 671270) If it is universal brotherhood—not only brotherhood of all human beings, but of all living beings—I find it in this mantra.
('70', 327, 1, 10, 671394) If it is unshakable faith in the Lord and Master—and all the adjectives you can think of—I find it in this mantra.
('70', 327, 1, 11, 671509) If it is the idea of complete surrender to God and of the faith that He will supply all that I need, then again I say I find it in this mantra.
('70', 327, 1, 12, 671653) Since He pervades every fibre of my being and of all of you, I derive from it the doctrine of equality of all creatures on earth and it should satisfy the cravings of all philosophical communists.
('70', 327, 1, 13, 671850) This mantra tells me that I cannot hold as mine anything that belongs to God, and if my life and that of all who believe in this mantra has to be a life of perfect dedication, it follows that it will have to be a life of continual service of our fellow creatures.
('70', 327, 1, 14, 672114) This, I say, is my faith and should be the faith of all who call themselves Hindus.
('70', 327, 1, 15, 672198) And I venture to suggest to my Christian and Mussalman friends that they will find nothing more in their scriptures if they will search them, and I want the aid of every body on earth— whether he is a Christian or a Mussalman or what else—to help the Hindus of Travancore to realize the lofty purpose that lies in this mantra.
('70', 327, 1, 16, 672525) I do not wish to hide from you the fact that I am not unaware of many superstitions that go under the name of Hinduism.
('70', 327, 1, 17, 672645) I am most painfully conscious of all superstitions that are to be found masqu 
('70', 328, 0, 1, 672724) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 329
('70', 328, 1, 2, 672773) erading as Hinduism and I have no hesitation to call a spade a spade.
('70', 328, 1, 3, 672843) I have not hesitated to describe untouchability as the greatest of these superstitions.
('70', 328, 1, 4, 672931) But in spite of them all, I remain a Hindu.
('70', 328, 1, 5, 672975) For I do not believe that these superstitions form part of Hinduism.
('70', 328, 1, 6, 673044) The very canons of interpretation laid down by Hinduism teach me that whatever is inconsistent with the truth I have expounded to you and what is hidden in the mantra I have named, must be summarily rejected as not belonging to Hinduism.
('70', 328, 1, 7, 673282) And I want you non Hindus to help the so called savarna Hindus to spread this truth in the midst of those whom they have hitherto regarded as untouchables, unapproa chables, invisibles.
('70', 328, 1, 8, 673468) I felt that I could not do justice to this great meeting, especially a meeting that is held in a Christian stronghold, unless I was prepared to utter a truth I held dear as life itself.
('70', 328, 1, 9, 673654) We all consciously or unconsciously pine and strive for peace on earth and goodwill amongst mankind.
('70', 328, 1, 10, 673755) I am convinced that we shall find neither peace nor goodwill among men and women through strife among men of different religions, through disputation among them.
('70', 328, 1, 11, 673917) We shall find truth and peace and goodwill if we approach the humblest of mankind in a prayerful spirit.
('70', 328, 1, 12, 674022) Anyway that is my humble appeal to Christians who may be present in this great meeting.
('70', 328, 1, 13, 674110) It is a privilege that may not occur again to any of you in your lifetime.
('70', 328, 1, 14, 674185) As I have said so often elsewhere, whilst the hand that traced the signature on the Proclamation was that of the Maharaja, the spirit that moved him to do so was that of God.
('70', 328, 1, 15, 674360) Would to God that that spirit might also fire everyone in Travancore to realize the implications of this Proclamation and to fire every one of you to advance the cause that the Proclamation enunciates.
('70', 328, 1, 16, 674562) I thank you from the bottom of my heart for the exemplary silence with which you have listened to my speech.

('70', 329, 2, 3, 674761) January 20, 1937
('70', 329, 3, 4, 674778) It is the partiality of the President of the Travancore Harijan Sevak Sangh that has made it possible for you to read one of your addresses.
('70', 329, 3, 5, 674919) I do not wonder at his partiality, because Changanacheri is his place.
('70', 329, 3, 6, 674990) But then I see that this address is an entrapping address, because if it really represents your views the partiality of the President can be easily excused.
('70', 329, 3, 7, 675147) This is the very comforting statement that you have made in your address: “Our religion has been purified.” Then you proceed to say: “All social inequalities have been removed.
('70', 329, 3, 8, 675324) Fatherhood of God and brotherhood of man has been established and we are in the happy land of Ramarajya in every sense of the term.” Well, if I was an inhabitant of Changanacheri and this address was read in my name and I had been asked to sign it, I should have to undergo various nights of vigil before I could subscribe to the statements therein.
('70', 329, 3, 9, 675674) If you had rested content with saying that all these things had been implied in the Proclamation, of which you have spoken in enthusiastic terms, it would have been quite in place and I should have said that you were right in reading all these implications in the Proclamation and that God might help you to live up to those implications.
('70', 329, 3, 10, 676013) But you have with a due sense of responsibility gone forward to make the bold assertions I have read out to you.
('70', 329, 3, 11, 676126) I know you have made them in pardonable enthusiasm.
('70', 329, 3, 12, 676178) But now I would ask you to abide by your statements and prove the validity of the assertions made here by your worthy conduct.
('70', 329, 3, 13, 676305) I should not wonder if you were to prove equal to the assertions you have made here, because, as you have given me the information, this is a Nambudiri stronghold and this is a private Nambudiri temple that they have generously and whole heartedly opened to the Harijans.
('70', 329, 3, 14, 676577) The way to live up to every assertion is by every individual doing these very things in his or her own life, and I tell you that a life of spirituality truly lived is far more infectious than all the microbes put together can prove on this earth.
('70', 329, 3, 15, 676824) And whereas we dread all these infections and would rather escape them, this is an infection which we would all welcome.
('70', 329, 3, 16, 676945) Let me hope and pray that all that you have said in this address may prove true in Travancore, and if it does so, I promise that it will prove true in the whole of India.

('70', 330, 2, 3, 677221) January 20, 1937
('70', 330, 3, 4, 677238) Lest I should forget them, you have been good enough to remind me of my many virtues.
('70', 330, 3, 5, 677324) If I had them, really they would have taken care of themselves without your reminding me of them.
('70', 330, 3, 6, 677422) And I am none the wiser for having been reminded of them.
('70', 330, 3, 7, 677480) But one thing you have omitted to do which was really necessary.
('70', 330, 3, 8, 677545) After reminding me of my virtues, you have gone into raptures over the Proclamation but you have failed to tell me what you propose to do with the Proclamation.
('70', 330, 3, 9, 677706) As I have been telling at every meeting, it is not the Maharaja’s work, it is the work of every man and woman in Travancore to do his or her duty, viz., to go down to the dens of Harijans, pull them out of them and raise them to the same status and level that you occupy in society.
('70', 330, 3, 10, 677989) Not till then will you have done your duty in terms of the Proclamation.

('70', 330, 6, 13, 678115) January 20, 1937
('70', 330, 7, 14, 678132) I am grateful to you for the address 2 that you have given to me.
('70', 330, 7, 15, 678198) Of course it is all very well for you to present me with addresses.
('70', 330, 7, 16, 678266) They have their value if they are properly coined and presented with the proper spirit behind them.
('70', 330, 7, 17, 678366) When I say that they should be properly coined, I say that they should express the sentiment you really cherish.
('70', 330, 7, 18, 678479) They should not contain fulsome praise of those to whom you present the address, but what you have done or are about to do should be stated therein for the information of the person to whom you present the address.
('70', 330, 7, 19, 678694) And today, as the central theme of our rejoicing is the graceful Proclamation issued by the Maharaja, naturally you will express your aspirations and actions in terms of this Proclamation.
('70', 330, 7, 20, 678883) And it does not matter in the least whether it is from the little children or from the Hindu public or the Youth League.
('70', 330, 7, 21, 679004) You have not really drafted your address in that way but that does not matter.
('70', 330, 7, 22, 679083) I am here to remind you of things that are expected of you
('70', 330, 8, 23, 679142) 1 This was in reply to several addresses presented to Gandhiji at this place.
('70', 330, 8, 24, 679220) 2 This had been presented to Gandhiji by the Nambudiris of Tazhman Mathan temple.
('70', 331, 0, 1, 679302) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 332
('70', 331, 1, 2, 679344) not only by the Maharaja and the Maharani, but of the things that the whole of India expects you to do.
('70', 331, 1, 3, 679448) At the present moment the whole of India is really dumbfounded.
('70', 331, 1, 4, 679512) It does not know whether such a thing could happen in this age.
('70', 331, 1, 5, 679576) Orthodoxy is shaken to its foundations.
('70', 331, 1, 6, 679616) It trembles to think of the consequences, not in a spirit of hostility by any means, but it is no doubt filled with suspicion and amazement.
('70', 331, 1, 7, 679757) It wonders whether untouchability was not after all a sin and a crime against humanity.
('70', 331, 1, 8, 679845) Now I can tell you what can be a net result of this doubt having entered the orthodox mind.
('70', 331, 1, 9, 679937) One of the results is bound to follow, and it will wholly depend upon the condition of the savarna Hindus.
('70', 331, 1, 10, 680044) The doubts of the orthodoxy will be dispelled like the morning mist at sunrise if the orthodoxy can really see that the savarnas of Travancore have washed themselves of the sin of untouchability.
('70', 331, 1, 11, 680240) On the contrary, if they come to know or feel that you are not playing the game and that you are secretly harbouring untouchability in your hearts, then the orthodoxy will also harden their hearts.
('70', 331, 1, 12, 680438) You will admit that such a result will be worse than that in which we are.
('70', 331, 1, 13, 680513) Therefore let not the enthusiasm that I have seen vanish like smoke immediately these celebrations are over.
('70', 331, 1, 14, 680622) On the contrary let it be said of you, savarna Hindus, that you have harnessed the energy born of this enthusiasm for the purification of Hinduism.
('70', 331, 1, 15, 680770) And I am flattering myself with the belief that I am leaving with you the golden key for the solution of all the difficulties that may linger in your hearts.
('70', 331, 1, 16, 680928) And that is to remember the first verse of the Ishopanishad and forget all about other scriptures.
('70', 331, 1, 17, 681027) You can really drown yourself and be suffocated in the ocean of literature known as the scriptures.
('70', 331, 1, 18, 681127) They are good for the learned and the wise, for they will humbly approach them, but I am sure that for the ordinary man in the street they are nothing but a burden.
('70', 331, 1, 19, 681292) It is not I who say these things, it is what those who wrote these scriptures have said.
('70', 331, 1, 20, 681381) I shall therefore leave this meeting with a free translation of that mantra.
('70', 331, 1, 21, 681458) It simply means this: “God pervades everything that we see” Therefore it is literally true what the Western science tells us, that Nature abhors a vacuum, for there is nothing on earth where God is not.
('70', 331, 1, 22, 681661) And if He occupies everything that is, there is nothing for us to occupy.
('70', 331, 1, 23, 681735) Therefore, the mantra says: “You must renounce everything.” But it does not say: “Renounce everything and perish.” On the contrary it says: “Renounce everything if you want to live.” For that act of renunciation or dedication to God will result in God taking the responsibility of feeding you, of housing you and of clothing you.
('70', 332, 0, 1, 682065) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 333
('70', 332, 1, 2, 682114) And then the mantra closes with this beautiful advice or injunction: “Do not covet anybody’s riches.” That does not mean that you must not take away these addresses from me.
('70', 332, 1, 3, 682288) But it means that your eyes must be single and pure, otherwise you would be criminals.
('70', 332, 1, 4, 682375) There never was anything yours nor could there be.
('70', 332, 1, 5, 682426) That applies to all our organs and if you follow what I say, action in terms of the Proclamation will be easy.
('70', 332, 1, 6, 682537) If you understand this formula of Hinduism—this distilled wisdom of all the sages that lived—you will go and fraternize with Harijans, pull them out of their dens and raise them to the same social level that you enjoy.

('70', 332, 6, 11, 682865) I understand what you say in them.
('70', 332, 6, 12, 682900) I do not know that I shall be able to give more time to the village work than I am giving.
('70', 332, 6, 13, 682991) My life has to be taken with its amazing limitations.
('70', 332, 6, 14, 683045) It is enough that I live in the village and think out things in terms of the village.
('70', 332, 6, 15, 683131) I must act as opportunity comes.
('70', 332, 6, 16, 683164) I do not mind Harijans working in the kitchen.
('70', 332, 6, 17, 683211) Of course the attitude towards them has to be progressively as towards members of the same family.
('70', 332, 6, 18, 683310) I am satisfied that that attitude is there.
('70', 332, 6, 19, 683354) It only requires growing emphasis.
('70', 332, 6, 20, 683389) As to Munnalal he will leave if he is not satisfied with the work as it comes to him.
('70', 332, 6, 21, 683475) I have to be patient.
('70', 332, 6, 22, 683497) I am glad you are quicker than before.

('70', 333, 2, 3, 683707) January 20, 1937 The scene at this meeting is a visible demonstration of the fact that what I am just now doing is nothing but a pilgrimage.
('70', 333, 2, 4, 683848) There is the river Pampa, there is the temple and here are thousands of people gathered together to rejoice over the Proclamation.
('70', 333, 2, 5, 683979) Such are the scenes which are witnessed during the progress of pilgrims all over India.
('70', 333, 2, 6, 684067) But then, if pilgrimages are undoubtedly matters that furnish joy for the soul, they must at the same time continue to remind us that we should purify ourselves continually in order to satisfy our Maker.
('70', 333, 2, 7, 684271) All the more so because of the gracious Proclamation that His Highness the Maharaja has given us.
('70', 333, 2, 8, 684369) I know that here we are all Harijans and non Harijans united without the slightest distinction.
('70', 333, 2, 9, 684465) It is well if our hearts are also equally united.
('70', 333, 2, 10, 684515) But if they are not united and we cherish all kinds of distinctions that have for ages past disfigured Hindu society, we are unworthy of that great Proclamation.
('70', 333, 2, 11, 684677) Great is the responsobility that lies upon the shoulders of those who hitherto regarded themselves as belonging to the superior castes.
('70', 333, 2, 12, 684813) The Proclamation invites such people to descend from the pedestal which they have occupied with no credit but with utter discredit to themselves and the faith which they have hopelessly misrepresented.
('70', 333, 2, 13, 685015) Let me therefore hope and pray that all who have been called savarna Hindus will make the determination to get rid of untouchability from their hearts and make common cause with those whom they have suppressed for ages.
('70', 333, 2, 14, 685235) I must, as the pilgrimage is about to finish, put before you for your consideration and assimilation the Ishopanishad which I have been doing for the last four or five days.
('70', 333, 2, 15, 685409) Let the mantra be your guide and your inspiration in everything you do.
('70', 333, 2, 16, 685481) Its meaning can be understood by even a little child and it is this: God pervades the tiniest atom in this mighty universe, and seeing that He is the sole Ruler and indispensable Master of everything that can be conceived and that there is in this universe, we are called upon to dedicate everything to Him.
('70', 333, 2, 17, 685789) In our ignorance we have fancied that so many things belong to us and that we possess them to the exclusion of everybody else.
('70', 333, 2, 18, 685916) So long as we entertain such a belief, we are not really Hindus, though being born of Hindu parents we may call ourselves Hindus.
('70', 333, 2, 19, 686046) Therefore, to be truly, deliberately and consciously Hindus, we have got to act according to this key mantra of all Upanishads and the whole of
('70', 334, 0, 1, 686190) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 335
('70', 334, 1, 2, 686239) Hinduism and renounce everything, even our body, and all that we hold near and dear to us, and dedicate it at the feet of God.
('70', 334, 1, 3, 686366) Then the mantra says if you do this, but not otherwise, God will give you your daily bread, a house to live in and clothes to cover your limbs with.
('70', 334, 1, 4, 686515) And it proceeds further by saying that since God is all powerful and nothing is impossible for Him and since you have surrendered everything to Him, He is not going to neglect you.
('70', 334, 1, 5, 686696) And hence you shall not covet anything that belongs to others, even a needle.
('70', 334, 1, 6, 686774) Now you can easily understand that in the presence of God, the Ruler of the Universe, who pervades everything—even those whom we have called the lowest of the low—all are equal.
('70', 334, 1, 7, 686952) So you will see how necessary it was for His Highness to issue this Proclamation, if he was to make good his title to be called a Hindu prince.
('70', 334, 1, 8, 687096) Now as I leave you I would like to leave this mantra with you, and if anybody challenges you and says anything in the name of Hinduism which is contrary to this mantra, you can tell him that you know everything about Hinduism and everything contrary to it is not Hinduism.

('70', 334, 4, 11, 687422) January 20, 1937
('70', 334, 5, 12, 687439) This is a typical village.
('70', 334, 5, 13, 687466) I tender you my congratulations for having of your own initiative got rid of untouchability even before the issue of the Proclamation.
('70', 334, 5, 14, 687601) The Proclamation now sets the seal of approval upon your work and makes your work acceptable to the whole of Travancore.
('70', 334, 5, 15, 687722) Now if your village has been as advanced as you claim it to be in this address, I would expect marvellous results in virtue of this Proclamation.
('70', 334, 5, 16, 687868) And I would tell you what I would expect you to do.
('70', 334, 5, 17, 687920) It will not satisfy me—it ought not to satisfy you—that isolated Hindus calling themselves savarnas mix with those whom they call avarnas.
('70', 334, 5, 18, 688059) I would now expect not only you, but the whole village, and all the surrounding villages, to forget all distinctions between Ezhavas, Pulayas, Pariahs and others, and that even in your hearts you do not harbour any such distinction.
('70', 334, 5, 19, 688292) If you will do this, I will also expect that there will be no Harijans perishing for want of food or clothing or for want of opportunities for education.
('70', 334, 5, 20, 688446) I would

('70', 335, 1, 2, 688496) expect your schools to be attended by Harijans as much as by non Harijans.
('70', 335, 1, 3, 688571) I hope you will bring about this result in no time.
('70', 335, 1, 4, 688623) If this Proclamation has, as if by magic, changed the hearts of the so called savarnas, then you will not measure the progress of the so called Harijans—socially, morally, economically—in driblets.
('70', 335, 1, 5, 688821) But the progress will be so phenomenal that it will be noticed by any observer in the way.
('70', 335, 1, 6, 688912) In my opinion that is the implication of the Proclamation and nothing else.
('70', 335, 1, 7, 688988) May I hope that you will live up to this implication?

('70', 335, 4, 10, 689096) January 20, 1937
('70', 335, 5, 11, 689113) Many glorious meetings I have had in Travancore have now accustomed me to meetings, however large they may be, and to what I may call pin drop silence.
('70', 335, 5, 12, 689265) It is a unique phenomenon that I have witnessed in this piligrimage of mine.
('70', 335, 5, 13, 689342) I have a vivid and happy recoll ection of meetings addressed in Travancore during my three previous visits.
('70', 335, 5, 14, 689450) I well remember they were very orderly and gave me great satisfaction.
('70', 335, 5, 15, 689521) But somehow or other this being in my opinion a purely religious pilgrimage of a humble penitent, I have been in need of perfect silence and I have been amply rewarded for my prayers.
('70', 335, 5, 16, 689705) At Kottayam I saw before me about this time last evening a vast assemblage of men and women whose number no one could calculate.
('70', 335, 5, 17, 689834) It was a sea of human faces.
('70', 335, 5, 18, 689863) I simply approached it in fear and trembling, because there was unfortunately no microphone arrang ement there.
('70', 335, 5, 19, 689975) The organizers had tried their best to make the arrang ement, but they had failed.
('70', 335, 5, 20, 690058) And yet, you will be pleased to learn from me that in that meeting, which was nearly ten times as large as this, there was wonderful silence for an hour or more.
('70', 335, 5, 21, 690220) I was amazed at this absolutely unexpected silence and patience of thousands of men and women at this vast meeting.
('70', 335, 5, 22, 690336) I am not mentioning these facts in order to satisfy idle curiosity or fill in the idle moments.
('70', 335, 5, 23, 690432) I mention this in order to emphasize the fact that these meetings have a religious character, and I hope I am not wrong to infer from the behaviour of these vast crowds that they were fired within, perhaps unconsciously,
('70', 335, 6, 24, 690653) 1 A report of the speech also appeared in Harijan, 6 2 1937.
('70', 336, 0, 1, 690714) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 337
('70', 336, 1, 2, 690763) by a religious spirit.
('70', 336, 1, 3, 690786) Whatever may have been the cause of this divine silence that you have given me, I know that for me there can be no other meaning.
('70', 336, 1, 4, 690916) I have regarded this, Proclamation as an act of Divinity, though outwardly it is the act of a great prince.
('70', 336, 1, 5, 691024) Any man, if possible even braver than the young Maharaja and his wise mother, would have quailed if he had reasoned out the pros and cons of a Proclamation of this character, and yet it was this young Maharaja who signed the Proclamation which was complete for the purpose for which it was intended.
('70', 336, 1, 6, 691324) And therefore it is that I have often said that though it was his hand that put the signature to the Proclamation, the spirit behind it was that of God working through the Maharaja.
('70', 336, 1, 7, 691506) Having, therefore, looked at the Proclamation in that light and having approached this pilgrimage in fear and trembling, I have pined for the opening out of your hearts.
('70', 336, 1, 8, 691676) I have not made a conscious effort to make any appeal to your reason, but I have made a conscious effort to make an appeal to your hearts and penetrate them, and unless I have deluded myself I fancy that I have made some approaches to your hearts.
('70', 336, 1, 9, 691924) Whether I have done so or not, I want to repeat what I have said at the previous meetings: that the burden of carrying out the Proclamation in letter and in spirit rests principally on savarna Hindus.
('70', 336, 1, 10, 692125) And the implication is emphatically this, that the savarna Hindus have to forget their wrong understanding of the message of Hinduism and the distinctions that they have up to now drawn between themselves and the avarna Hindus.
('70', 336, 1, 11, 692353) The Proclamation emphatically means that untouchability, unapproachability and unseeability are all relics of the past and that those Hindus who have arrogated superiority for themselves will forget that they were superior human beings and will remember that they are the children of the same God and that all savarnas and avarnas are equal.
('70', 336, 1, 12, 692695) The Proclamation is addressed to every Hindu, and every one of you is expected to show that he has understood it and he has to carry it out in his day to day dealings with those whom he has hitherto regarded as Pariahs of socity.
('70', 336, 1, 13, 692925) I do not propose to carry on this appeal to the savarna Hindus any further tonight.
('70', 336, 1, 14, 693009) The Maharaja had nothing to do beyond issuing the Procla mation.
('70', 336, 1, 15, 693074) It was cent per cent truthful in so far as one would want to know his opinion in regard to untouchability.
('70', 336, 1, 16, 693181) So far as I can see, there is nothing to amplify the Proclamation.
('70', 336, 1, 17, 693248) Therefore, in your presence I propose to address a few words to His Highness, Her Highness and to their advisers.
('70', 337, 0, 1, 693362) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 338
('70', 337, 1, 2, 693404) Great as this Proclamation is and great as is its religious merit, greater still is the responsibility that His Highness has taken upon his shoulders, and also that of his advisers.
('70', 337, 1, 3, 693586) Whilst without the effort of every savarna Hindu the Proclamation can undoubtedly be rendered ineffective, I must also say that the Proclamation will not have its full effect unless it is backed in an ample measure by State action.
('70', 337, 1, 4, 693818) So far as I can see the Proclamation demands State activities in all departments of life.
('70', 337, 1, 5, 693908) Of these I propose to take the religious first; because from it must follow activities in all the other departments.
('70', 337, 1, 6, 694025) Temples have been matters of indifference, except to women, who have no capital save divine faith, and to men who from many mixed motives have been going to them.
('70', 337, 1, 7, 694188) They have been neglected by what may be called the intelligentsia.
('70', 337, 1, 8, 694255) The result has been that they have almost ceased to be repositories of Hinduism and have ceased to impart spiritual power to those who have followed the faith.
('70', 337, 1, 9, 694415) They have ceased to shed unmistakeble spiritual fragrance in and about and around them.
('70', 337, 1, 10, 694503) Then I venture to suggest that it is the duty of the State or of the Maharaja—if there is any distinction betweem the two, for he is the custodian of the vast majority of Hindu temples—that he should see to it that the temples are renovated spiritually and have the authority and sanctity that they used undoubtedly to have at one time.
('70', 337, 1, 11, 694840) And I believe that it can only be done if they are in charge of priests who know what they have to do, who know something of the sanctity of them and of the duties to which they are called.
('70', 337, 1, 12, 695030) In other words, they should not be ignorant people following their calling for a livelihood but they should be men who are proud of their privilege of bringing the message of God to temple goers, showing by their own conduct and their life that these temples are abodes of Divinity.
('70', 337, 1, 13, 695313) Then there should be the correct kind of instruction given in these temples.
('70', 337, 1, 14, 695390) The Harijans will be taken by the hand by someone in charge of temples and they will be told what they are expected to gain by temple worship.
('70', 337, 1, 15, 695533) This means undoubtedly, according to modern thought, a revolution in the upkeep and conduct of these temples.
('70', 337, 1, 16, 695643) But the Proclamation itself is nothing short of a revolutionary document and if that revolution is to touch, as it ought to touch, the lives of all Hindus, naturally temples have to be abodes of the living God and not abodes of a mere mass of gold or other metals worked into figures.
('70', 337, 1, 17, 695928) Then I should expect a history of these temples, understandable by the common folk, to be distributed free or at a cheap price to all who want to know what these temples are.
('70', 337, 1, 18, 696103) That means a training school for
('70', 338, 0, 1, 696136) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 339
('70', 338, 1, 2, 696185) training the right kind of teachers who will be entrusted with the religious training of the people.
('70', 338, 1, 3, 696286) If some such thing does not happen, I fear that the purpose of the Proclamation, viz., to expect and to induce lakhs and lakhs of Harijans to go to these temples in a religious spirit, will fail.
('70', 338, 1, 4, 696482) So much for the religious department.
('70', 338, 1, 5, 696520) Then I take the economic.
('70', 338, 1, 6, 696546) The economic life of the Harijans has got to be lifted out of its miserable state.
('70', 338, 1, 7, 696629) I venture to think that by a judicious and thoughtful working out of the programme, it can be prosecuted in a short time and with a limited financial outlay, in such a manner that Harijans may be easily able to hold their own by being taught to turn an honest chakram.
('70', 338, 1, 8, 696898) Nor can the State now dare neglect the mental training—I mean literary—of these people.
('70', 338, 1, 9, 696986) I know to my cost that today it is very difficult to carry on a connected conversation with Pulayas and Pariahs so that you can get a ready response even about simple facts of life.
('70', 338, 1, 10, 697168) Similarly, the State has to raise the social status of these people.
('70', 338, 1, 11, 697237) They should be invited to all State occasions and functions, as for instance Durbars.
('70', 338, 1, 12, 697323) They must not be allowed to feel that these functions are a sealed book to them, and that they should have to have another agitation before they can attain a social status entitling them to be invited or allowed to take part in those functions.
('70', 338, 1, 13, 697568) But if the Proclamation bears the meaning I have given to it, then the social uplift of the Harijans has to come as if by magic, as the religious status of going to the temples has come.
('70', 338, 1, 14, 697755) In my humble opinion, in suggesting this fourfold programme of the uplift of the Harijans in the State I have not suggested any programme beyond the capacity or resources of a State like Travancore.
('70', 338, 1, 15, 697954) But having addressed these few words to the State in all humility, I want to come back to you.
('70', 338, 1, 16, 698049) The State may resolve to do all these things, but its resolution will not mean the coming in of manpower in order to carry out all these things.
('70', 338, 1, 17, 698194) And if, from the few words I have addressed to Their Highnesses and their advisers, you think that after all it is Their Highnesses who have to do everything and you have to do nothing, then I am afraid that my labours will have gone in vain.
('70', 338, 1, 18, 698437) The resquisite manpower has got to be supplied by you, and as a man of experience I will tell you that manpower cannot come by offers of money.
('70', 338, 1, 19, 698581) Thus, for instance, men who are capable of taking the
('70', 339, 0, 1, 698635) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 340
('70', 339, 1, 2, 698677) management of temples cannot be had by offering scholarships of hundreds of rupees.
('70', 339, 1, 3, 698761) For such people have got to be fired by a religious spirit, by love of their own work, and should therefore be ready to work for a bare maintenance.
('70', 339, 1, 4, 698910) It should be their proud privilege to take this training and to fit themselves for this highest task in life.
('70', 339, 1, 5, 699020) Similarly, unless the State gets men required for giving Harijans educational training, the State can do nothing.
('70', 339, 1, 6, 699134) After all, there is a world of meaning about the title that the Maharajas of Travancore have adopted for themselves, viz., Padm anabhadas.They pride themselves in calling themselves servants of God, but that means that they are also servants of their people.
('70', 339, 1, 7, 699393) So, as I said at one of these meetings, the Maharajas are not the first lords among the people of Travancore, but they are the first servants among the people who are also servants.
('70', 339, 1, 8, 699575) But the first servants of the people will fare badly unless they are ably assisted by the people who are their fellow servants.
('70', 339, 1, 9, 699703) Therefore the meaning of His Highness the Maharaja going to the temple every day and taking instructions as to his daily duties from Shri Padmanabhaswami means nothing less than that he should be assisted by his people for their own good—spiritual, religious, social, economic.

('70', 339, 5, 15, 700140) K.M.M. Narayan Nambudiripad deserves the very best congratulations from me, and I hope you will associate yourselves with me in giving him congratulations for following the great example of His Highness the Maharaja.
('70', 339, 5, 16, 700357) Thereby he is simply living up to the best traditions of Hinduism.
('70', 339, 5, 17, 700424) He is, therefore, by opening this and seventeen other temples belonging to him, rendering a distinct service in the process of purification of Hinduism.
('70', 339, 5, 18, 700577) I have great pleasure in declaring the temple open.

('70', 340, 2, 3, 700748) January 21, 1937
('70', 340, 3, 4, 700765) This is the very last stage of my pilgrimage in Travancore.
('70', 340, 3, 5, 700825) I said elsewhere that I came here with great hesitation, equal reluctance, and in fear and trembling; and but for the very pressing and urgent wire of Sjt.
('70', 340, 3, 6, 700981) Govindan you would not have seen me in your midst today.
('70', 340, 3, 7, 701038) The telegrams were sent under the joint signatures of Sjt.
('70', 340, 3, 8, 701097) Govindan and Sjt.
('70', 340, 3, 9, 701115) Ramachandran.
('70', 340, 3, 10, 701129) But Ramachandran being a child of Sabarmati, I might not have listened to him; but I dreaded the signature of an ex judge of Travancore and, more than that , a leader of the Ezhavas.
('70', 340, 3, 11, 701312) And so at last very reluctantly I capitulated; but having done so, I am free to confess that I am very glad that I capitulated.
('70', 340, 3, 12, 701440) I am taking away with me spiritual treasures of which I had not dreamt before.
('70', 340, 3, 13, 701519) Your magnificent temples were as much closed against me, by a voluntary effort on my part, as they were against the tallest amongst the Ezhavas, Pulayas and Pariahs, who were until the other day despised by the savarna Hindus.
('70', 340, 3, 14, 701746) But having found the doors of these temples flung open by the very generous act of His Highness, I entered them with the same joy that must have been felt by the thousands of Ezhavas, Pulayas and Pariahs who must have gone to these temples since the Proclamation.
('70', 340, 3, 15, 702010) After having entered responsible [sic] life, I cannot say that I ever was a habitual temple goer.
('70', 340, 3, 16, 702108) But the possibility for spiritual growth by entering these temples in a spiritual and devotional mood has dawned upon me, as it never before had, after all these visits to these temples in a devotional and prayerful mood.
('70', 340, 3, 17, 702330) But, of course, one needs a proper attitude of mind before one can derive the highest consolation and spiritual joy from visiting these temples.
('70', 340, 3, 18, 702475) As it is, I have just now come from having performed the opening ceremony of a private temple belonging to Sjt.
('70', 340, 3, 19, 702587) K.M.M. Narayan Nambudiripad.
('70', 340, 3, 20, 702616) The ceremony of opening this temple was equal to opening his other temples in Travancore, and I derived the keenest joy in the privilege to open this temple.
('70', 340, 3, 21, 702774) I have opened several temples before now, but I cannot say that I had such joy in opening those temples.
('70', 340, 3, 22, 702879) I had missed in those temples the presence of God.
('70', 340, 3, 23, 702930) There seemed to me to be a kind of artificiality about the opening of those temples.
('70', 340, 3, 24, 703015) Here, on the contrary, wherever I have gone, I have seen a spontaneity that I was not prepared for.
('70', 340, 3, 25, 703115) Nor was I prepared for thousands of people waiting for my entry in these temples.
('70', 340, 3, 26, 703197) No doubt they had come in order to see what must have been to them a
('70', 341, 0, 1, 703266) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 342
('70', 341, 1, 2, 703308) zoological specimen.
('70', 341, 1, 3, 703329) But I am quite certain that that was not the sole motive in thousands of them coming here and standing in silent and absolutely devotional mood.
('70', 341, 1, 4, 703474) A scoffer and a sceptic might be easily misled in saying that all this is a figment of my imagination, and has no correspondence to reality.
('70', 341, 1, 5, 703615) But if such is really the case, I am here to tell you that the whole of my life and growth are due to such figments of imagination and it would be true at least to say of me that I have needed these figments for my growth.
('70', 341, 1, 6, 703838) And after all imagination is not such a despicable thing that you can neglect it altogether in mundane affairs of life.
('70', 341, 1, 7, 703958) Whatever it may be, I leave this word with you that if you will translate the Proclamation that His Highness the Maharaja, guided by Padmanabhaswami, has given you, you will have to identify yourselves completely with all and abolish the distinctions of high and low, savarnas and avarnas; and in order to assist you to do so, I want to translate for you the verse I have been putting before the people for the last four or five days.
('70', 341, 1, 8, 704393) The meaning of that verse is this: God the Ruler, our Master and Lord, pervades everything in the universe down to the tiniest atom.
('70', 341, 1, 9, 704526) It means that He is not merely in your heart or my heart but he is literally and absolutely in every one of the innumerable pores of our skin and the hair of our head.
('70', 341, 1, 10, 704694) And, therefore, He is nearer to you and to me than our dearest ones.
('70', 341, 1, 11, 704763) Then the first essential of Hinduism is that we realize the truth of this magnificent statement as we realize that we are sitting here and you are listening to me.
('70', 341, 1, 12, 704927) Having realized the truth, the seer proceeds to say that since God is so near to us and dominates all our actions, we must voluntarily renounce and dedicate at His feet all that we have regarded as our own.
('70', 341, 1, 13, 705134) But even after that act of conscious and deliberate dedication and renunciation , we shall want to eat, clothe ourselves and house ourselves, and so the seer says you can only after this dedication use these necessaries of life as if they were given to you by God Himself.
('70', 341, 1, 14, 705407) That requires the same trust, the same faith and the same love that a child without reasoning it out for himself has for his parents.
('70', 341, 1, 15, 705541) He never reasons out for himself that it is all well with them and for him so long as his parents are there and so long as they continue to anticipate and supply his wants.
('70', 341, 1, 16, 705714) Our parents are as much mortal as we ourselves, and therefore it is infinitely more logical and necessary for us that we should have as much faith in God to anticipate and supply our wants.
('70', 341, 1, 17, 705904) And having told us these three things, the seer proceeds to warn us against coveting anybody’s possessions.
('70', 341, 1, 18, 706012) Now you will see that if we
('70', 342, 0, 1, 706040) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 343
('70', 342, 1, 2, 706089) believe in this mantra—and every Hindu is bound to believe in it— there would be no distinctions like those which have been sapping the very foundations of Hinduism and Hindu society.
('70', 342, 1, 3, 706273) Now you can also at once realize why temples are and must be an integral part of our lives.
('70', 342, 1, 4, 706365) We are so easily forgetful of our obligations that we have to renew our vows of loyalty to God, renew our renunciation and dedication from day to day.
('70', 342, 1, 5, 706516) These temples are the visible symbols of God’s power and authority.
('70', 342, 1, 6, 706584) They are, therefore, truly called the houses of God, the houses of prayer.
('70', 342, 1, 7, 706659) We go there in a prayerful mood and perform, first thing in the morning after ablutions, the act of dedication and surrender.
('70', 342, 1, 8, 706785) Scoffers and sceptics may say that all these are figments of imagination, that we are imagining God in the images we see.
('70', 342, 1, 9, 706907) I will say to these scoffers that it is so.
('70', 342, 1, 10, 706951) I am not ashamed of confessing that imagination is a powerful factor in life.
('70', 342, 1, 11, 707029) The temple is not a house of God for, say, my cow, although the cow is as much my fellow being as any human being.
('70', 342, 1, 12, 707144) But God has not blessed the cow with imagination, and her presence in the temple has no effect on her, but my presence has a well defined effect, because I have imagined that the particular temple contains the presence of God.
('70', 342, 1, 13, 707371) Therefore, I would love to leave this mantra with you and tell you that whatever is inconsistent with this mantra you must summarily reject as not Hinduism, and having assimilated all that there is in this mantra, you need not worry about other books that pass by the name of Hindu scriptures.
('70', 342, 1, 14, 707665) Far be it from me to suggest that all else is absolutely worthless or harmful.
('70', 342, 1, 15, 707744) There are undoubtedly worthless things that are current as Hindu Shastras, but there are also priceless treasures hidden in these books.
('70', 342, 1, 16, 707881) But you and I have not the time to study them and even if you had the time, I would utter a word of caution to the effect that if a study of the scriptures confuses your mind, it would be well to leave them alone and derive your comfort from this mantra to the exclusion of everything else.
('70', 342, 1, 17, 708172) And now with a brief reference to my happy experience in Travancore and courteous performance of the obligation that a visitor owes to his hosts, I shall close the proceedings.
('70', 342, 1, 18, 708349) I and the whole of my company owe a deep debt of gratitude to the organizers of this pilgrimage who left no stone unturned to make it as comfortable as possible under the circumstances.
('70', 342, 1, 19, 708535) I am deeply grateful to Their Highnesses and to Sachivottama Sir C.P. Ramaswami
('70', 343, 0, 1, 708615) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 344
('70', 343, 1, 2, 708657) Aiyar for having extended to me and to my party the hospitality of the State.
('70', 343, 1, 3, 708735) Naturally this hospitality made my passage through Travancore—and it has been such a rush—free of difficulties and afforded me comforts which otherwise I should not have received.
('70', 343, 1, 4, 708915) But more than to these high personages and the managers of this pilgrimage, our thanks are due to those who were in actual charge of my day to day programme.
('70', 343, 1, 5, 709073) For instance, the chauffeurs of the three cars that were placed at our disposal were unremitting in their attention, and I am happy to tell you that they did their work without a single untoward accident.
('70', 343, 1, 6, 709278) They willingly did their work, never minding whether it was night or day.
('70', 343, 1, 7, 709352) And so also did the cooks, for whom, I assure you, it was a laborious task to prepare our meals from stage to stage.
('70', 343, 1, 8, 709469) We were never at one place for more than 24 hours.
('70', 343, 1, 9, 709520) Almost invariably the breakfast had to be taken at one place, the lunch at another place and the dinner at a third place.
('70', 343, 1, 10, 709642) But these cooks were ever ready for the tasks allotted to them.
('70', 343, 1, 11, 709706) And there was the officer in charge of these who accompanied us from Trivandrum and supervised everything.
('70', 343, 1, 12, 709813) He has been equally unremitting in his attention and studiously courteous.
('70', 343, 1, 13, 709888) But for the hearty co operation of all these friends whom I have named, we could not have negotiated this pilgrimage without anyone of us getting ill.
('70', 343, 1, 14, 710039) And then I may not omit the Tahsildars at every place who were ready to render every assistance required.
('70', 343, 1, 15, 710145) My thanks are due to every one of them and to others whom I may have inadvertently omitted to mention.
('70', 343, 1, 16, 710248) I am just reminded that I had neglected that necessary limb of the law, I mean the Police.
('70', 343, 1, 17, 710339) The Police have not acted after the proverbial manner to which we are accustomed in India.
('70', 343, 1, 18, 710430) They really acted in the most gentlemanly manner for which the Police in England are celebrated throughout the world.
('70', 343, 1, 19, 710548) Whatever Englishmen may be here in India, the English Police constable in England is really a gentleman.
('70', 343, 1, 20, 710653) I understand that every morning when he is sent out on duty, he is required to repeat the formula that he is not a master but a servant of the people.
('70', 343, 1, 21, 710804) He has to deal courteously with innumerable people with whom he has to come in daily contact and he may not handle even criminals roughly.
('70', 343, 1, 22, 710943) And as English law, like all law, requires that no man should be considered guilty unless he is so adjudged by law, the Police in England are taught to be courteous even to people who may be found guilty of murder and caught red handed.
('70', 343, 1, 23, 711180) And so you understand what high praise I am bestowing on
('70', 344, 0, 1, 711237) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 345
('70', 344, 1, 2, 711286) the Police here when I say that they behaved in the same gentlemanly manner as they behave in London.
('70', 344, 1, 3, 711388) Naturally, therefore, they are entitled to the same thanks that I have given to the others I mentioned before.
('70', 344, 1, 4, 711499) Lastly, I would thank you, the present audience, and ask you not to forget that the carrying out of the Proclamation rests with every one of you individually.

('70', 344, 4, 7, 711742) [January 12/21, 1937] 2
('70', 344, 5, 8, 711766) I suppose it is true of temples in India—in the South as well as in the North—that there are courtyards attached to them where bhajan parties give their bhajans and teachers give their discourses.
('70', 344, 5, 9, 711963) But what I propose to do here and what I have been doing for some days is somewhat different from what I have described to you.
('70', 344, 5, 10, 712091) Ever since my return to India we have had, in our Ashram and wherever I have gone, prayers about this time every evening, and I have been so very much enthused over my pilgrimage that I had been longing to have my prayers under the shadow of your grand temples.
('70', 344, 5, 11, 712353) So I enquired of the trustees whether I could have a prayer meeting under the shadow of the presiding deity of the temple which I am visiting for the first time in my life.
('70', 344, 5, 12, 712526) The permission was readily given and I am grateful to the trustees for it.
('70', 344, 5, 13, 712601) I shall now explain to you the various part of the prayer we have every evening.
('70', 344, 5, 14, 712682) I am going to commence by reciting the first verse of the Ishopanishad which I have been explaining at various meetings.
('70', 344, 5, 15, 712803) I must give you the gist of the verse which I consider to be the bedrock of Hinduism without which Hinduism is nothing and with which Hinduism need not be anything else.
('70', 344, 5, 16, 712973) God the Creator and Ruler pervades every atom, ever so tiny, in the universe, and therefore seeing that it is all God’s and God pervades everything, we have to surrender
('70', 344, 6, 17, 713143) 1 Mahadev Desai says: “Whenever we happened to be near a temple in the evening, we used to have our evening prayer in the temple precincts.
('70', 344, 6, 18, 713283) Gandhiji explained everywhere in brief the meaning of various parts of the prayer.
('70', 344, 6, 19, 713366) This is what he said at these prayer meetings.” 2 Gandhiji was in Travancore from January 12 to January 21.
('70', 345, 0, 1, 713474) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 346
('70', 345, 1, 2, 713516) everything and renounce everything in His favour and eat or enjoy or use just what He gives from day to day.
('70', 345, 1, 3, 713625) The verse closes by saying: “Do not covet anybody’s riches.” There is nothing so satisfying and beautiful in all the scriptures of the world as this mantra and it enunciates a universal truth applicable to all.
('70', 345, 1, 4, 713836) This will be followed by a recitation of the 19 last verses of the second chapter of the Bhagavad Gita.
('70', 345, 1, 5, 713940) They tell us what we should do to become good Hindus, how we should behave towards one another and towards ourselves.
('70', 345, 1, 6, 714058) Then since all cannot understand Sanskrit we have a simple bhajan or hymn from one of our saints who devised this beautiful medium to convey to us the essence of Hinduism.
('70', 345, 1, 7, 714230) We draw our bhajans from the exhaustless stores of Kabir, Tulsidas, Surdas, Nanak, Mirabai, Tyagaraja, Tukaram, and other saints of India.
('70', 345, 1, 8, 714369) But there are others who cannot understand even these simple bhajans, and so to direct their attention Godward we simply repeat the name of Rama.
('70', 345, 1, 9, 714515) And then since our recent penetration into the villages we have readings from Tulsidas’s Ramayana which is one of the gems of our religious literature.
('70', 345, 1, 10, 714667) It is known to millions of villagers in North India, and its music is such that even listening to its chant will uplift you.
('70', 345, 1, 11, 714792) Now I hope you will follow the prayer somewhat intelligently.

('70', 345, 4, 14, 714912) MADRAS, January 22, 1937
('70', 345, 5, 15, 714937) This visit to Travancore has been in every sense of the term a pilgrimage for me.
('70', 345, 5, 16, 715019) The Harijan tour of Orissa, which in part I made on foot, I did describe as a pilgrimage.
('70', 345, 5, 17, 715109) But it was not a pilgrimage in the orthodox sense of the term, except perhaps in the language of Nandana.
('70', 345, 5, 18, 715215) Has it not been said that he walked miles in order to see God face to face in the temple of his imagination, while knowing that the temple doors would be shut in his face?
('70', 345, 5, 19, 715387) The difference, however, is that he succeeded in being admitted to the temple, whereas in Orissa, I failed hopelessly.
('70', 346, 0, 1, 715506) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 347
('70', 346, 1, 2, 715555) To Travancore I went in the spirit of an orthodox pilgrim knowing beforehand that the very temples that were closed to me because they were closed to fellow Harijans, were open for me and them.
('70', 346, 1, 3, 715749) In this sense this was the very first pilgrimage I had ever undertaken in my life.
('70', 346, 1, 4, 715832) Though before I decided not to visit temples that were closed to Harijans, I visited some temples, it was not as a pilgrim.
('70', 346, 1, 5, 715956) It was part of the tour or tours undertaken for other purposes, for instance khadi and Khilafat.
('70', 346, 1, 6, 716053) But this was definitely to visit numerous temples in Travancore.
('70', 346, 1, 7, 716118) And I must say that my most sanguine expectations were more than realized.
('70', 346, 2, 8, 716193) The so called savarnas and the so called avarnas mingled without distinction, in their thousands, everywhere I went.
('70', 346, 2, 9, 716310) They entered the numerous temples without let or hindrance.
('70', 346, 2, 10, 716370) The officiating priests conducted their service and distributed flowers, sandal paste and prasadam without the slightest hesitation.
('70', 346, 2, 11, 716503) I saw no sullenness in their faces.
('70', 346, 2, 12, 716539) The whole scene seemed to me to be a spontaneous response to the Proclamation and a recognition of the fact that it was meeting a long felt want.
('70', 346, 2, 13, 716685) I had the fear that Harijans would not flock to the temples as they did.
('70', 346, 2, 14, 716758) I had also the fear that this long deprivation might have made them indifferent to temple worship, nay, indifferent to religion itself.
('70', 346, 2, 15, 716894) Evidently it was not so.
('70', 346, 2, 16, 716919) They must have felt the craving, consciously or unconsciously, for the worship of which they were deprived, when the other Hindus, called savarnas, were not.
('70', 346, 2, 17, 717077) So it appeared to me that they came into their own naturally; and, therefore, there was no difficulty about their knowing what a devotional spirit was or how they should worship.
('70', 346, 3, 18, 717256) I know thousands came to the temples, and lined the roads leading to them.
('70', 346, 3, 19, 717331) The silence that they observed was exemplary and worthy of the sacredness of the occasion.
('70', 346, 3, 20, 717422) This moved me to my innermost depths and I could not help giving vent to some of the expressions that I did in my speeches.
('70', 346, 3, 21, 717546) They came, all of them, out of the feeling in my heart.
('70', 346, 3, 22, 717602) I was called to the many meetings fully unprepared.
('70', 346, 3, 23, 717654) There was no time left by the organizers for me to think out what I should say.
('70', 346, 3, 24, 717734) When, therefore, I said that though the hand that traced the signature to the Proclamation was that of the young Maharaja, the spirit behind was that of God, I meant it literally.
('70', 346, 4, 25, 717914) I can only hope that this great step taken by the Maharaja, under the wise guidance of his mother and the advice of his Dewan, will be followed up by Cochin and the other Indian States and even in British
('70', 347, 0, 1, 718119) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 348
('70', 347, 1, 2, 718161) I was therefore delighted to read in The Hindu of yesterday that Professor K. Sundararaman, who is known to be a sanatanist, has suggested that there should be enabling legislation in British India, empowering trustees, wherever they think it desirable and necessary, to open temples under their charge to the so called untouchables, precisely on the same terms as they are open today to other Hindus.
('70', 347, 1, 3, 718563) The sooner such legislation is brought about, the better it is for Hinduism and for Hindus.
('70', 347, 1, 4, 718655) What is happening in Travancore is likely to happen in all the other parts of India, because Hindu nature in Travancore cannot be different from Hindu nature elsewhere.
('70', 347, 1, 5, 718824) After all, only a few months ago, nobody was prepared for the great event in Travancore.
('70', 347, 1, 6, 718913) As a matter of fact, it was thought then that Travancore would not give the lead as it has bravely done; but that it would be the last to throw open its mighty temples to Harijans.
('70', 347, 1, 7, 719094) But the unexpected has happened; and that constitutes a miracle of modern times.
('70', 347, 1, 8, 719175) Travancore has shown the way and it would be a great pity if it is not followed, as I have suggested, by the other Indian States, and by British India, as Prof.
('70', 347, 1, 9, 719336) Sundararaman has suggested.
('70', 347, 2, 10, 719364) The Hindu representative desired Gandhiji to say a word to the orthodox.
('70', 347, 2, 11, 719437) Of course, orthodox opinion can do a great deal.
('70', 347, 2, 12, 719486) I see that some meetings have been held in Tamil Nad, disapproving of the Proclamation.
('70', 347, 2, 13, 719574) I hope, however, that this disapproval is no proof of general disapproval by the orthodoxy.
('70', 347, 2, 14, 719666) They ought to recognize the time spirit.
('70', 347, 2, 15, 719707) No true religion can tolerate distinctions between man and man.
('70', 347, 2, 16, 719771) The sooner, therefore, the orthodox people recognize the necessity of a change, the better it would be for the faith of which they regard themselves as special custodians.
('70', 347, 2, 17, 719943) I hope, therefore, that they will follow the lead given by Prof.
('70', 347, 2, 18, 720008) Sundararaman.
('70', 347, 3, 19, 720022) Replying to a question regarding the State action he desired to be taken, following the Proclamation, in the directions he mentioned in his speech at Pandalam, Gandhiji remarked: It is not an ambitious programme.
('70', 347, 3, 20, 720235) I have not the least doubt it can be easily worked.
('70', 347, 3, 21, 720287) Only there must be the will.

('70', 348, 2, 3, 720440) January 22, 1937
('70', 348, 3, 4, 720457) Gandhiji said that he was glad to remain in their midst even for a few hours.
('70', 348, 3, 5, 720535) If they were wise and prudent, they ought to keep the premises of the institution spick and span.
('70', 348, 3, 6, 720633) He saw a number of cobwebs in the roofing and also pits in the compound.
('70', 348, 3, 7, 720706) The residential students should see that these defects were removed.
('70', 348, 3, 8, 720775) The management was paying a heavy rent of Rs. 40 per mensem for the building and if the students made a wise use of the place, they could get that amount out of it.
('70', 348, 3, 9, 720940) Another thing he noticed was that there was no spinning and weaving.
('70', 348, 3, 10, 721009) If they took to spinning and weaving, say, at least, for an hour a day, it would doubly benefit them.
('70', 348, 3, 11, 721111) They could make their own cloth and sell also the extra cloth woven by them.
('70', 348, 3, 12, 721188) Those who were in control of this institution should consider whether it was practicable to adopt his suggestion.
('70', 348, 3, 13, 721302) He would like the inmates to remember the two things he had mentioned.

('70', 348, 6, 16, 721421) January 22, 1937
('70', 348, 7, 17, 721438) While I was in Travancore, offering prayers in the presence of huge assemblies, pin drop silence prevailed.
('70', 348, 7, 18, 721546) A divine silence pervaded the atmosphere.
('70', 348, 7, 19, 721588) But here, even in this small assembly, there is not that silence.
('70', 348, 7, 20, 721654) I do not think that the devotion I saw at Travancore was due to a fit of enthusiasm.
('70', 348, 7, 21, 721739) If you here have , on a modest scale, that kind of religious spirit which is now in Travancore, you will also see the same silence pervading devotional meetings here.
('70', 348, 7, 22, 721906) I hope you will remember it.
('70', 348, 7, 23, 721935) If Hinduism in the future is to live as one of the great religions on earth, a religious revival such as the one in Travancore has got to be brought about throughout the length and breadth of India.
('70', 348, 7, 24, 722134) I invite you to reason out the pros and cons of it by your individual conduct.
('70', 348, 7, 25, 722213) I shall now say a few words about the prayer recited.
('70', 348, 7, 26, 722267) The first recital was of the last nineteen verses of the second chapter of the Bhagavad Gita.
('70', 348, 7, 27, 722361) These verses are being sung at evening prayers because they are reminders to every Hindu of how he should conduct himself on earth.
('70', 348, 7, 28, 722493) The second part of the prayer is a bhajan from old saints, which is for those who do not understand Sanskrit.
('70', 348, 7, 29, 722603) Since there are millions in this country who cannot even recite bhajans, our forefathers have discovered a method which is a mere recital of the
('70', 349, 0, 1, 722748) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 350
('70', 349, 1, 2, 722790) name of God whom you recognize as Rama, Krishna or by thousands of other names.
('70', 349, 1, 3, 722870) Then the last thing is a recitation from Tulsidas’s Ramayana.
('70', 349, 1, 4, 722932) This is a later introduction; since the village movement has been started, it has been found necessary to take some such thing to the villagers.
('70', 349, 1, 5, 723077) Tulsidas’s Ramayana is known to millions of Indians north of the Vindhya Range.
('70', 349, 1, 6, 723157) I regard this Ramayana as one of the richest spiritual treasures that humanity possesses.
('70', 349, 1, 7, 723247) Its music is lofty and its language equally lofty.
('70', 349, 1, 8, 723298) Some sort of evening prayer before retiring to bed is necessary.
('70', 349, 1, 9, 723363) Just as we require food for the body, so also we require, in the shape of prayers, food for the soul, for we know and recognize that there is something besides our body.
('70', 349, 1, 10, 723533) If you try prayer for some time sincerely, you will discover with me that whereas you may go without bodily food for some time, even with profit, you may not desire to go without the spiritual food.
('70', 349, 1, 11, 723732) If prayers are offered both in the morning and evening, you will soon find that a time will come when you will be disgusted if you omit to offer prayers.
('70', 349, 2, 12, 723886) In conclusion, Gandhiji appealed to the gathering to give donations to the Harijan Institute which was doing useful work for the Harijans.
('70', 349, 3, 13, 724025) Small cash, jewels, watches and fountain pens were offered.
('70', 349, 3, 14, 724085) Gandhiji humorously asked Srimati Lakshmi, daugther of Mr. Satyamurti, “What are you going to give?” She immediately took out a pair of gold bangles from her hands and gave them to Gandhiji.

('70', 349, 6, 19, 724392) Do you think it would be good for India?
('70', 349, 7, 20, 724433) ANSWER: Communism of the Russian type, that is communism which is imposed on a people, would be repugnant to India.
('70', 349, 7, 21, 724549) I believe in non violent communism.
('70', 349, 8, 22, 724585) Q. But communism in Russia is against private property.

('70', 350, 1, 2, 724983) A. If communism came without any violence, it would be welcome.
('70', 350, 1, 3, 725047) For then no property would be held by anybody except on behalf of the people and for the people.
('70', 350, 1, 4, 725144) The millionaire may have his millions, but he will hold them for the people.
('70', 350, 1, 5, 725221) The State could take charge of them whenever they would need them for the common cause.
('70', 350, 2, 6, 725309) Q. Is there any difference of opinion between you and Jawaharlal in respect of socialism?
('70', 350, 3, 7, 725399) A. There is, but it is a difference in emphasis.
('70', 350, 3, 8, 725448) He perhaps puts an emphasis on the result, whereas I put on the means.
('70', 350, 3, 9, 725519) Perhaps according to him I am putting over emphasis on non violence, whereas he, though he believes in non violence, would want to have socialism by other means if it was impossible to have it by non violence.
('70', 350, 3, 10, 725729) Of course my emphasis on non violence becomes one of principle.
('70', 350, 3, 11, 725793) Even if I was assured that we could have independence by means of violence, I shall refuse to have it.
('70', 350, 3, 12, 725896) It won’t be real independence.
('70', 350, 4, 13, 725927) Q. But do you think the English will leave India to you and go back peacefully as a result of your non violent agitation?
('70', 350, 5, 14, 726049) A. I do think so.
('70', 350, 6, 15, 726067) Q. What is the basis of your belief?
('70', 350, 7, 16, 726104) A. I base my faith in God and His justice.
('70', 350, 8, 17, 726147) Q. You are more Christian than we so called Christians.
('70', 350, 8, 18, 726203) I will write these words down in block letters.
('70', 350, 9, 19, 726251) A. You must, otherwise God would not be God of Love but God of violence.

('70', 350, 13, 23, 726384) PYARELAL,
('70', 350, 14, 24, 726394) I passed quite a few days considering whether I should write to you or talk to you.
('70', 350, 14, 25, 726478) I am merely putting on a brave front.
('70', 350, 14, 26, 726516) My fear of you does not allow me to do anything.
('70', 350, 14, 27, 726565) But lest I should repent later I am overcoming my fear of writing to you.
('70', 350, 14, 28, 726639) Why am I afraid?
('70', 350, 14, 29, 726656) Is it because you have always been scared of me?
('70', 350, 14, 30, 726705) But you had no reason to do so, while I have every reason to fear
('70', 351, 0, 1, 726771) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 352
('70', 351, 1, 2, 726813) Must you still torment me?
('70', 351, 1, 3, 726840) Have some pity on me.
('70', 351, 1, 4, 726862) Why do you not believe that even man’s actions are prompted by the will of God?
('70', 351, 1, 5, 726942) Who has been unfair to you, the world or God?
('70', 351, 1, 6, 726988) Why should you fight against God?
('70', 351, 1, 7, 727022) Suicide is an affront to God.
('70', 351, 1, 8, 727052) Dispel my fear if you can.
('70', 351, 1, 9, 727079) Allow me to sit in peace and work.
('70', 351, 1, 10, 727114) I would be satisfied even if you only made rotis for me.
('70', 351, 1, 11, 727171) I would be content even if you just remained before my eyes.
('70', 351, 1, 12, 727232) Why should you believe that only what you think is knowledge?
('70', 351, 1, 13, 727294) What should I write?
('70', 351, 1, 14, 727315) I am always praying to God that He may grant you good sense and I may not lose you !

('70', 351, 7, 22, 727618) I want you to be strictly honest with me and tell me how many of you have suffered and how many have not.
('70', 351, 7, 23, 727724) I have worked on many an occasion in distressed areas, e.g., in Bihar, where the distress was infinitely greater than here, but even there cent per cent people had not suffered.
('70', 351, 7, 24, 727902) If several thousands had suffered, several hundreds had escaped.
('70', 351, 7, 25, 727967) Now I would ask such of you as have actually suffered to raise their hands 3. I am glad, and I know that those who have suffered would not come to attend these meetings.
('70', 351, 7, 26, 728137) I should have to go to them.
('70', 351, 7, 27, 728166) Then please make the beginning, and those of you who have not suffered please pay for the sufferers as much as you can.

('70', 351, 9, 30, 728355) Mahadev Desai says: “Gandhiji was invited .
('70', 351, 9, 31, 728399) .to give a day for the cyclone area.
('70', 351, 9, 32, 728436) Gandhiji could not resist the request .
('70', 351, 9, 33, 728476) and he hurried through 129 miles from Nidubrole to Bezwada, taking on his way places like Chirala, Bapatla, Vetapalem, Gollapalem, Timmasundaram, Paruchuru, Chilakaluripeta and Guntur, making collections.” 2 According to Gandhi—1915 1948, Gandhiji was in Andhra on this date.

('70', 352, 1, 2, 728831) 364. SPEECH IN AN ANDHRA VILLAGE 1
('70', 352, 2, 3, 728866) [January 23, 1937]
('70', 352, 3, 4, 728885) I have been wandering from 6.30 through the cyclone area, but I cannot say that I have seen much.
('70', 352, 3, 5, 728983) If I really wanted to see the cyclone area, I should not have gone about like a lord in a car but should have walked through it.
('70', 352, 3, 6, 729112) But I had only a few hours and there is no time left for anything like a study of the situation.
('70', 352, 3, 7, 729209) The only thing I can do, having come here, is to say a word of comfort.
('70', 352, 3, 8, 729281) I know that my voice cannot reach the Government.
('70', 352, 3, 9, 729331) I have no influence with them, nor have I any with those in charge of affairs here.
('70', 352, 3, 10, 729415) But I can certainly say that though everyone else may forsake you, God never forsakes people in distress.
('70', 352, 3, 11, 729521) When I studied Tamil many years ago I came across a proverb which I cannot forget.
('70', 352, 3, 12, 729604) This is it: Tikkattravannukku Daivametunai, which means, ‘for those who are helpless, God is the help.’ But it should not remain merely on our lips, it should enter our hearts, and then no matter how many cyclones we have, we shall rejoice within.
('70', 352, 3, 13, 729852) That also does not mean that you will be lazy.
('70', 352, 3, 14, 729899) A man who has faith in God works twenty four hours, for He has given us hands and feet.
('70', 352, 3, 15, 729987) And if we use them, He will give us food and clothing too.
('70', 352, 3, 16, 730046) So you must not expect me to weep with you.
('70', 352, 3, 17, 730090) My function is to make those who weep forget their sorrow and smile.
('70', 352, 3, 18, 730159) And I know you know how to smile.
('70', 352, 3, 19, 730193) But those only can smile well who know how to labour with their hands and feet for others and, especially in a place like this, those can smile who divide their good fortune with others.
('70', 352, 3, 20, 730380) If the powers that be give us help, we shall receive it gratefully, but if it does not come, we will not commit suicide or swear at them, nor become misanthropes instead of philanthropes.
('70', 352, 3, 21, 730568) You must therefore be cheerful and help your less fortunate brethern.
('70', 352, 3, 22, 730638) I am coming from a place where a gentleman has given away six acres of land for Harijans.
('70', 352, 3, 23, 730728) Those who are wealthy will, I hope, follow his example.

('70', 353, 2, 3, 730918) [January 23, 1937] I cannot estimate the actual extent of the damage, but I may say that I have seen many a house utterly destroyed, more houses where the roofs had been blown off, many huts remain utterly uninhabitable even after three months.
('70', 353, 2, 4, 731163) Mighty trees have been bent from their roots and there were innumerable fields from which crops were swept away.
('70', 353, 2, 5, 731276) It seems to me that the relief granted by Government and sent to the Committee by the public was wholly inadequate to this emergency.
('70', 353, 2, 6, 731410) At Vinayashramam, when it was quite dark, hundreds of men and women were eager to see me and when I started my mission of begging, there was not a man or woman that did not pay.
('70', 353, 2, 7, 731588) Some sisters gave away their jewels.
('70', 353, 2, 8, 731625) I have no influence with Government.
('70', 353, 2, 9, 731662) I can only make an appeal to them, if my voice can reach them.

('70', 353, 5, 13, 731797) [ January 23, 1937]
('70', 353, 6, 14, 731817) Mahatmaji, at the outset, referred to the heavy damage done to a portion of the Guntur District by the recent cyclone and regretted that he had no time to narrate his experiences of his tour in that affected area.
('70', 353, 6, 15, 732031) When Guntur was affected, people in Andhradesha thought that the whole of Andhradesha was afflicted and so there was not sufficient contribution to the Cyclone Relief Fund.
('70', 353, 6, 16, 732204) Proceeding he said: I hold it is not true.
('70', 353, 6, 17, 732247) I commenced collecting subscriptions even at Vinayashramam and other affected areas.
('70', 353, 6, 18, 732332) In God’s dispensation, even in the most affected areas, there are some who escaped affliction and can contribute to the relief of the distressed.
('70', 353, 6, 19, 732478) Necessarily people from the unaffected areas also came to see me.
('70', 353, 6, 20, 732544) As it is usual in Andhradesha they contributed liberally.
('70', 353, 6, 21, 732602) I have been rushing through space and so I had no time to count the collections.
('70', 353, 6, 22, 732683) Many ladies gave away their jewels.
('70', 353, 6, 23, 732719) I can say I have collected roughly Rs. 1,500. If I had more time, I would have collected more money.
('70', 353, 6, 24, 732820) Because several weeks have passed by, do not think no further relief is necessary.
('70', 353, 6, 25, 732903) Some of the vast damages are irreparable.
('70', 353, 6, 26, 732945) There are some humble

('70', 354, 1, 2, 733184) huts which require adequate and immediate relief.
('70', 354, 1, 3, 733234) For want of sufficient funds, they are still left in the same state.
('70', 354, 1, 4, 733303) Some are roofless and some wall less.
('70', 354, 1, 5, 733341) If money comes, they will be repaired.
('70', 354, 1, 6, 733380) I want you to give at this meeting as much as possible.
('70', 354, 1, 7, 733436) Even afterwards, continue sending liberal contributions to the Cyclone Relief Fund.
('70', 354, 1, 8, 733520) Let it not be said of the people in Andhradesha that homes were destroyed, crops were swept away, trees were uprooted, men and cattle killed, and yet no person in Andhradesha lifted his finger to organize relief.
('70', 354, 1, 9, 733733) Because a part has been affected, let no one say that the whole of the province has been affected.
('70', 354, 1, 10, 733832) It is altogether wrong to expect that Bombay would relieve the distress.
('70', 354, 1, 11, 733905) People in Bombay will not see the havoc.
('70', 354, 1, 12, 733946) You can see it within a few miles of you.
('70', 354, 1, 13, 733988) You must do all in your power before you look to any other province for help.

('70', 354, 4, 16, 734130) A friend has addressed me the following conundrums:
('70', 354, 5, 17, 734182) (1) If temples are thrown open to the Harijans, there is danger of their next insisting on being admitted to all the parts where the priest is admitted, only because they satisfy the test of personal cleanliness.
('70', 354, 6, 18, 734395) (2) Your statement that God does not reside in temples where Harijans are not admitted seems to me to be a one sided and therefore misleading statement.
('70', 354, 6, 19, 734548) In my opinion it is as untrue to say that God is not in temples where Harijans are not admitted as that God is to be found only in temples and not outside.
('70', 354, 6, 20, 734704) It challenged, as it were, the omnipresence of God.
('70', 354, 6, 21, 734756) He is everywhere; there is no place where He is not.
('70', 354, 7, 22, 734809) (3) Then, you say that Hinduism must perish if untouchability lives.
('70', 354, 7, 23, 734878) But Hinduism has continued to exist all these years in spite of the institution of untouchability, and there is no reason why it should be otherwise now or in future.
('70', 354, 7, 24, 735045) Nor should you forget that it is Hinduism with its much abused institution of untouchability that, on your own admission, has in the past brought you spiritual peace and consolation.
('70', 354, 7, 25, 735228) Now, for my reply.
('70', 354, 7, 26, 735247) A man of faith may not shrink from his present duties or deviate from the right path for fear of possible difficulties in the future.
('70', 354, 7, 27, 735381) The only thing for us, therefore, is to
('70', 354, 8, 28, 735421) 1 The Gujarati original of this was published in Harijanbandhu, 24 1 1937. This translation is by Pyarelal.
('70', 355, 0, 1, 735529) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 356
('70', 355, 1, 2, 735571) proceed by implicitly accepting absolute equality between ourselves and the harijans and to give them the same credit for reasonableness as we claim for ourselves.
('70', 355, 1, 3, 735735) All past experience goes to show that they do not resent such restrictions as are reasonable and apply equally to the savarna Hindus, but they naturally do not and cannot be expected to appreciate and accept ex cathedra usages that discriminate between savarnas and avarnas, and between the different groups among the avarnas themselves, as these smack of invidiousness and offend against reason.
('70', 355, 1, 4, 736132) (2) True, the statement that God does not dwell in temples from which Harijans are excluded is one sided and therefore true in a certain and limited sense only.
('70', 355, 1, 5, 736293) But does that not apply to human speech itself?
('70', 355, 1, 6, 736341) But we have not on that account condemned or discarded the use of human speech.
('70', 355, 1, 7, 736421) With all its imperfections as a vehicle for the expression of truth, we must rely on it for all practical purposes, or it would spell an end of all human intercourse.
('70', 355, 1, 8, 736588) Tulsidas has made Rama say in his Ramayana that God dwells only in the hearts of the good and the pure, not of those who are wicked or evil minded.
('70', 355, 1, 9, 736736) Now this statement, again, is only partly true.
('70', 355, 1, 10, 736784) But still more untrue and mischievous in its pragmatic effect would be its reverse, viz, that God dwells in the hearts of the wicked and evil minded too and actuates them in their evil deeds, though as a strictly scientific statement of truth it would be perhaps nearer the mark.
('70', 355, 1, 11, 737064) In a strictly scientific sense God is at the bottom of both good and evil.
('70', 355, 1, 12, 737139) He directs the assassin’s dagger no less than the surgeon’s knife.
('70', 355, 1, 13, 737206) But for all that good and evil are, for human purposes, from each other distinct and incompatible, being symbolical of light and darkness, God and Satan, Ahriman and Ormuzd respectively.
('70', 355, 1, 14, 737393) My statement, therefore, that where Harijans are excluded there God is not, must stand.
('70', 355, 1, 15, 737481) (3) My correspondent’s argument here altogether lacks point.
('70', 355, 1, 16, 737542) The slow disintegration of Hinduism one can see even today taking place under our very nose, mainly and principally in consequence of the curse of untouchability.
('70', 355, 1, 17, 737705) Anyone who has eyes can see it.
('70', 355, 1, 18, 737737) A moribund, life in death sort of existence should not be mistaken for life; in fact it is more distressing than death itself.
('70', 355, 1, 19, 737864) If a person like me can today derive spiritual force and consolation from Hinduism, it is because I have never regarded untouchability as an integral part of Hinduism.
('70', 355, 1, 20, 738032) It may perhaps be objected that the term ‘disintegration of Hinduism’ which I have used is misleading since disintegration of Hindu society need not necessarily mean the disintegration of Hindu

('70', 356, 1, 2, 738275) religion.
('70', 356, 1, 3, 738285) The objection is based on a fallacy and is only partly valid.
('70', 356, 1, 4, 738347) In mundane sense a faith can have no existence apart from its votaries.
('70', 356, 1, 5, 738419) It may personally console me even if I can bear witness to my faith as its sole surviving representative; but of what avail would it be to those millions who fell away from it?

('70', 356, 4, 8, 738649) My help is expected in raising of funds for these Ashrams.
('70', 356, 4, 9, 738708) I am sorry to say that my plight is as pitiable as that of the man who having once burnt his tongue with milk, blows even on buttermilk before drinking it.
('70', 356, 4, 10, 738864) This does not mean that no one should help those ashrams.
('70', 356, 4, 11, 738922) I can no longer request people or write to them as I did in the past.
('70', 356, 4, 12, 738992) I do not have the courage to do so.
('70', 356, 4, 13, 739028) But those who have been supporting such ashrams should make inquiries for their own satisfaction and continue to help them if they are satisfied.
('70', 356, 4, 14, 739174) It has never happened with regard to any institution in the world that all the workers have turned out good.
('70', 356, 4, 15, 739283) This should not stop all the public activities.
('70', 356, 4, 16, 739331) If some workers have proved to be false coin, there are others who have been carrying on their work in keeping with moral principles and have brought credit to their institutions.
('70', 356, 4, 17, 739511) The work of Harijan welfare will go on and it should go on.
('70', 356, 4, 18, 739571) All that is necessary is that the organizers who have so far depended on me should give up all hopes of me.
('70', 356, 4, 19, 739679) I am alive today, but may not be tomorrow.
('70', 356, 4, 20, 739722) How long can one trust one’s physical frame?
('70', 356, 4, 21, 739767) Hence the organizers should consider my pitiable condition and, relying on themselves, bring credit to the institutions to which they belong.
('70', 356, 4, 22, 739909) Those who are engaged in Harijan welfare activities or any other service should never give up faith or their work.

('70', 357, 4, 5, 740184) We reached here today.
('70', 357, 4, 6, 740207) Kanti went to Poona taking Saraswati with him.
('70', 357, 4, 7, 740254) He will come to Bombay with her.
('70', 357, 4, 8, 740287) Paparamma had been to Bangalore but could not come here.
('70', 357, 4, 9, 740344) Sharma has met you.
('70', 357, 4, 10, 740364) If you wish to come and see Saraswati you may.

('70', 357, 10, 16, 740544) You did not write to me probably because I was touring.

('70', 357, 10, 18, 740623) Write and tell me how you are.

('70', 357, 16, 30, 740947) We returned from the tour yesterday.
('70', 357, 16, 31, 740984) I had a letter from Nanavati from which I learnt that your brother could not be said to have improved yet.
('70', 357, 16, 32, 741091) You will have got my last letter.
('70', 357, 16, 33, 741125) I hope you are following the suggestions I made in it.

('70', 358, 5, 7, 741679) SEGAON, WARDHA, January 25, 1937
('70', 358, 6, 8, 741712) BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS,
('70', 358, 7, 9, 741731) I had been hesitating to go to Travancore but it was good I did.
('70', 358, 7, 10, 741796) God knows what the others got but I for one got more than money.
('70', 358, 7, 11, 741861) You will find an account in Harijan.
('70', 358, 7, 12, 741898) Double it and you will have an idea of what I mean.
('70', 358, 7, 13, 741950) I saw the Maharaja and the Maharani.
('70', 358, 7, 14, 741987) The interview was good.
('70', 358, 7, 15, 742011) We talked fully and frankly.
('70', 358, 7, 16, 742040) Such unprecedented awakening among Harijans, and of such a natrue, would not have been possible in any other way.
('70', 358, 7, 17, 742154) My belief is getting stronger that the branches can get from the centre not funds but moral support and prestige.
('70', 358, 7, 18, 742268) If they are not satisfied with this they may well close down or work independently.
('70', 358, 7, 19, 742352) In that eventuality we may do what we can through the agency.
('70', 358, 7, 20, 742414) Those branches should be regarded useless that cannot collect funds to meet their expenditure.
('70', 358, 7, 21, 742509) I feel no necessity for waiting for a year in this respect.
('70', 358, 7, 22, 742569) Whatever changes in Harijan Nivas are contemplated need not be put off for a year.
('70', 358, 7, 23, 742652) Why not reduce the unnecessary expenses from now?
('70', 358, 7, 24, 742702) But of course Thakkar Bapa’s assent is required and Malkani too must be consulted.
('70', 358, 7, 25, 742785) I am trying to draw Dinkar and have already sent a letter to him.
('70', 358, 7, 26, 742851) The correspondence with Parameshwari is still continuing.
('70', 358, 7, 27, 742909) I am awaiting one more letter from him and shall write to you further when I receive it.
('70', 358, 7, 28, 742998) I have now agreed that he may be authorized to form a new institution and that he may do what he wants so long as our work goes on.
('70', 358, 7, 29, 743130) The condition solely is that he should be able to carry on with the funds available and without seeking loans.

('70', 359, 4, 5, 743441) 373. LETTER TO KANTILAL GANDHI
('70', 359, 5, 6, 743472) SEGAON, WARDHA, January 26, 1937
('70', 359, 7, 7, 743505) I got your letter.
('70', 359, 7, 8, 743524) It does not become you to say that you should like to go Rasik’s way.
('70', 359, 7, 9, 743594) If you believe that you are taking due care of your health, I would have nothing to say.
('70', 359, 7, 10, 743683) I thought you were joking when you said that you wished to fly to Paparamma.
('70', 359, 7, 11, 743760) On the subject being mentioned casually, Prabhavati told me that you really wanted to fly to Trivandrum.
('70', 359, 7, 12, 743865) If this is true, then it is something I don’t like.
('70', 359, 7, 13, 743917) The aeroplane is not for the poor or for a man who is patient.
('70', 359, 7, 14, 743980) You probably know that I don’t like even cars, though I do use them when I can’t help it.
('70', 359, 7, 15, 744070) This may be described as a weakness of mine.
('70', 359, 7, 16, 744115) Moreover, where is the plane fare to come from?
('70', 359, 7, 17, 744163) If any friend offers to pay it, I wouldn’t like you to accept it, nor even if Paparamma sends it.
('70', 359, 7, 18, 744261) I can’t stand your becoming a beggar.
('70', 359, 7, 19, 744299) But this is my philosophy.
('70', 359, 7, 20, 744326) You need not ask for my permission to fly in a plane.
('70', 359, 7, 21, 744380) You are free and I should like you to act freely.
('70', 359, 7, 22, 744430) It would be a different thing if you deferred to my views voluntarily and with faith.
('70', 359, 7, 23, 744516) Your freedom will not be compromised thereby.
('70', 359, 7, 24, 744562) But I shouldn’t like it if you did something to please me or out of fear of me.
('70', 359, 7, 25, 744642) That will not be for your good.
('70', 359, 7, 26, 744674) I would rather that you acted upon only those ideas of mine which you can readily accept.
('70', 359, 7, 27, 744764) How can you help it if you can’t like my ideas?
('70', 359, 7, 28, 744812) If I were to find fault with you for that, I myself would be guilty of a wrong.
('70', 359, 7, 29, 744892) You may, therefore, do as you please as regards flying to Trivandrum.

('70', 360, 7, 8, 745315) MY DEAR HENRY, Owing to the pilgrimage to Travancore, it has not been possible for me to write to you earlier.
('70', 360, 7, 9, 745426) Your question is whether I retain the same opinion as I did at the R.T.C. of 1931. I said then and repeat now that so far as I am concerned, if Dominion Status were offered in terms of the States of Westminister, i.e., the right to secede at will, I would unhesitatingly accept it.

('70', 360, 11, 19, 746043) Daily accompanies me on my walks.
('70', 360, 11, 20, 746077) Drinks plenty of milk these days.

('70', 361, 1, 6, 746515) Lilavati teaches him arithemetic.

('70', 361, 1, 8, 746616) I got a letter from Mr. Kallenbach written on his way.
('70', 361, 1, 9, 746671) My previous letter had remained at Maganwadi through oversight.

('70', 361, 1, 16, 747107) Or, stay in the Mahila Ashram here.

('70', 361, 6, 24, 747447) BHAI MUNSHI, My right hand is disabled and it would take more time to write with the left.
('70', 361, 6, 25, 747538) Today I can’t spare that much time.
('70', 361, 6, 26, 747574) I didn’t write anything to Rajaji.
('70', 361, 6, 27, 747609) The newspapers are nowadays cultivating very efficiently the art of telling lies.
('70', 361, 6, 28, 747691) When Mahadev and I first read the news about Rajaji contesting the election, we just laughed at it.
('70', 361, 6, 29, 747791) I was taken aback by the news about my consent.
('70', 361, 6, 30, 747839) Rajaji did explain to me in Madras why he had come to that decision.
('70', 361, 6, 31, 747908) I am not ready to believe that his candidature is necessarily for the good.
('70', 361, 6, 32, 747984) Since I have respect for his decisions, I do hope that this decision of his will benefit the country.
('70', 361, 6, 33, 748086) But my mind is not ready at present to go further than this.
('70', 361, 6, 34, 748147) I will welcome it if you can spare me in regard to the late Narasinhrao.
('70', 361, 6, 35, 748220) I have already conveyed to his family members my homage to his sacred memory.
('70', 361, 6, 36, 748298) I had great respect for him and it was increasing day by day.
('70', 361, 6, 37, 748360) I admired his faith in God.

('70', 362, 6, 8, 748680) DEAR AIYAMUTHU,
('70', 362, 7, 9, 748696) Shankerlal Banker has sent me a copy of your letter which I consider hysterical.
('70', 362, 7, 10, 748777) I had given you some credit for possessing a sense of humour but I see I was thoroughly mistaken.
('70', 362, 7, 11, 748875) Chelaswami must have been particularly dense seeing that he could not appreciate the very delicate compliment which I really paid you when he told me that he was not Aiyamuthu.
('70', 362, 7, 12, 749052) The compliment was this.
('70', 362, 7, 13, 749077) You did not consider it necessary to rush up to Faizpur 1 and abandon your post of duty in Tirupur.
('70', 362, 7, 14, 749177) All the while I was talking to Chelaswami I was smiling and cracking jokes.
('70', 362, 7, 15, 749253) So I said, as far as I can recollect, something like this.
('70', 362, 7, 16, 749312) ‘Why should Aiyamuthu come here?
('70', 362, 7, 17, 749345) He sends you here and himself loafs about in Tirupur’.
('70', 362, 7, 18, 749400) Chelaswami’s densen ess I can excuse but I cannot excuse yours.
('70', 362, 7, 19, 749464) Surely you should have at once said to Chelaswami: ‘You do not understand what Bapu meant.
('70', 362, 7, 20, 749555) He liked my restraint in not going to Faizpur’.
('70', 362, 7, 21, 749603) Now tell me if you understand this letter and whether it helps you out of your agony?
('70', 362, 7, 22, 749689) And do you now understand what the poets all over the world have said, viz., that a man is the maker of his own hapiness and misery.
('70', 362, 8, 23, 749822) Yours, BAPU SJT.

('70', 363, 10, 13, 750595) January 29, 1937
('70', 363, 11, 14, 750612) DEAR KALIDAS NAG,
('70', 363, 12, 15, 750630) I have your letter written on the boat taking you to Honolulu.
('70', 363, 12, 16, 750693) I have no inspiring message to give to anybody if non violence is not its own message.
('70', 363, 12, 17, 750780) But I can state my own experience of nearly fifty years of practice that there is no force known to mankind which is equal to non violence.
('70', 363, 12, 18, 750920) It cannot, however, be learnt through books.
('70', 363, 12, 19, 750965) It has got to be lived.
('70', 363, 13, 20, 750989) You ask me to mention books.
('70', 363, 13, 21, 751018) For the reason just stated it is difficult to single out books purely dedicated to an exposition of non violence.
('70', 363, 13, 22, 751132) Richard Gregg’s Power of Non violence may be studied with

('70', 364, 1, 3, 751250) Tolstoy’s later writings are also aids to a contemplation of non violence.

('70', 364, 7, 10, 751523) What have you been doing?
('70', 364, 7, 11, 751549) Have you asked Trivediji for Rs. 100?
('70', 364, 7, 12, 751587) Devdas is deeply pained.
('70', 364, 7, 13, 751612) Is it right for you to ask for money in this manner without his permission?
('70', 364, 7, 14, 751688) What was your promise to me?
('70', 364, 7, 15, 751717) What has happened to it?
('70', 364, 7, 16, 751742) What do you want Rs. 100 for?
('70', 364, 7, 17, 751772) Won’t you open your heart to me?
('70', 364, 7, 18, 751805) I feel much worried about you.
('70', 364, 7, 19, 751836) Won’t you free me from my worry and fear?
('70', 364, 7, 20, 751878) Please reply immediately and write to Devdas also.

('70', 364, 10, 23, 752020) 382. A CHRISTIAN LETTER
('70', 364, 11, 24, 752044) Rajkumari Amrit Kaur was with me during the Travancore pilgrimage.
('70', 364, 11, 25, 752111) Though she could not enter the temples, she followed the pilgrimage in all other respects.
('70', 364, 11, 26, 752202) She has felt moved by what she observed during the pilgrimage, and has placed in my hands the following letter 1 which I dare not withhold from the reader:
('70', 364, 12, 27, 752358) I am of opinion that the missionary with the best intention in the world—for we must credit him with honesty of purpose—has wronged Indian Christians in more ways than one.
('70', 364, 12, 28, 752531) Many converts here have been denationalized, e.g., even their names have been changed in many instances
('70', 364, 13, 29, 752635) 1 Only extracts have been reproduced here.
('70', 365, 0, 1, 752678) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 366
('70', 365, 1, 2, 752720) to those of Europeans; they have been told that there is no true light to be found in the religion of their forefathers.
('70', 365, 1, 3, 752841) The ancient scriptures of their ancestors are a closed book to them .
('70', 365, 1, 4, 752911) At the same time, while there has been no conscious effort to purge the Indian Church of the taint of untouchability that exists within its own doors, the untouchability that exists in Hinduism has been exploited to the extent of so called Christianity of the Depressed Classes.
('70', 365, 1, 5, 753190) I say ‘so called Christianity’ advisedly, because I know that not one of these poor people to whom I have spoken—and I have spoken to many— has been able to tell me anything of the spiritual implications of his change of faith.
('70', 365, 1, 6, 753418) That he is equally ignorant of the faith of his forefathers and has been sadly neglected by his own community does not seem to me to be ample or any reason for transplanting him to an alien soil where he can find no root.
('70', 365, 2, 7, 753640) Your utterances during your pilgrimage of penitence in Travancore have been a great joy.
('70', 365, 2, 8, 753729) In particular do I rejoice in your special message to the Christian community at Kottayam 1. In admitting once again the equality of all religions you have given Christians much food for thought, and I hope and pray that this will be the beginning of an era of self purification for them no less than for the members of the Hindu fold.
('70', 365, 2, 9, 754065) Are we not all Hindus in as much as we are the children of Hind?
('70', 365, 2, 10, 754130) Is there not room for Jesus in Hinduism?
('70', 365, 2, 11, 754171) There must be.
('70', 365, 2, 12, 754186) I cannot believe that any who seek to worship God in spirit and in truth are outside the pale of any of the great religions which draw their inspiration from Him who is the fountain head of all Truth.
('70', 365, 2, 13, 754387) I am sure I am not the only Indian born in the Christian faith who holds these views, but I feel that if the teaching and example of Jesus are to enrich the life of our country, Indian Christians must turn the searchlight inwards and seek to serve in that spirit of humility and tolerance which is the essence of all true religion and without which there can be no unity and no peace and goodwill on earth.
('70', 365, 3, 14, 754794) Will you not help the Indian Christian to realize his mission?
('70', 365, 3, 15, 754857) You can, because you have drawn inspiration from Jesus’ undying teachings as embodied in the Sermon on the Mount.
('70', 365, 3, 16, 754971) We assuredly stand in need of guidance.
('70', 365, 3, 17, 755011) Owing to her close contact with me there was hesitation on my part over the publication.
('70', 365, 3, 18, 755100) But the knowledge that she has very imperfectly voiced what other Christian friends have told me has overcome my hesitation.
('70', 365, 3, 19, 755225) But I do not feel competent to guide Indian Christians.
('70', 365, 3, 20, 755281) I can, however, appeal to them as I did at Kottayam and as I have done before then through these columns.
('70', 365, 3, 21, 755387) I am on safer ground in responding to the Rajkumari’s belief that there is in Hinduism room enough for Jesus, as there is for Mahomed, Zoroaster and

('70', 366, 0, 1, 755591) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 FEBRUARY, 1937 367
('70', 366, 1, 2, 755640) For me the different religions are beautiful flowers from the same garden, or they are branches of the same majestic tree.
('70', 366, 1, 3, 755763) Therefore they are equally true, though being received and interpreted through human instruments equally imperfect.
('70', 366, 1, 4, 755879) It is impossible for me to reconcile myself to the idea of conversion after the style that goes on in India and elsewhere today.
('70', 366, 1, 5, 756008) It is an error which is perhaps the greatest impediment to the world’s progress towards peace.
('70', 366, 1, 6, 756103) ‘Warring creeds’ is a blasphemous expression.
('70', 366, 1, 7, 756149) And it fitly describes the state of things in India, the mother as I believe her to be of religion or religions.
('70', 366, 1, 8, 756262) If she is truly the mother, the motherhood is on trial .
('70', 366, 1, 9, 756319) Why should a Christian want to convert a Hindu to Christianity and vice versa?
('70', 366, 1, 10, 756398) Why should he not be satisfied if the Hindu is a good or godly man?
('70', 366, 1, 11, 756466) If the morals of a man are a matter of no concern, the form of worship in a particular manner in a church, a mosque or a temple is an empty formula, it may even be a hindrance to individual or social growth, and insistence on a particular form or repetition of a credo may be a potent cause of violent quarrels leading to bloodshed and ending in utter disbelief in religion, i.e., God Himself.

('70', 366, 3, 13, 756879) 383. WANT OF THOROUGHNESS
('70', 366, 4, 14, 756905) There is in Travancore an association called The All Kerala Young Folks’ League.
('70', 366, 4, 15, 756986) Its ambitious motto is ‘We serve’.
('70', 366, 4, 16, 757021) They have also a ‘League of Pity’ as a branch activity.
('70', 366, 4, 17, 757077) For want of time, during the nine days’ rush in Travancore, for a personal discussion, the members sent me a letter from which I cull the following:
('70', 366, 5, 18, 757226) Boys and girls are encouraged to learn some handicrafts by which they can earn some money.
('70', 366, 5, 19, 757317) We are quite glad to tell you that many of our boys have taken to spinning as one of their hobbies.
('70', 366, 5, 20, 757417) As beginners in this field, we have also several problems to be solved and difficulties to be encompassed.
('70', 366, 5, 21, 757524) The one thing that is troubling us much regarding the spinning of yarn is its disposal.
('70', 366, 5, 22, 757612) We submit that the yarn produced by our boys and girls is of a low type and cannot find a good market.
('70', 366, 5, 23, 757715) But the difficulty even for the good type of yarn is that we cannot sell even that to our advantage.
('70', 366, 5, 24, 757816) And hence many of our members have begun to drop the hobby.
('70', 366, 5, 25, 757876) We shall be grateful if you please tell us of some method to dispose of it.
('70', 366, 5, 26, 757952) A portion of the money thus earned by the members is given to the poor.
('70', 367, 0, 1, 758024) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 368
('70', 367, 1, 2, 758066) On every Onam day all our members, regardless of caste or creed, collect together to celebrate our Goodwill Day.
('70', 367, 1, 3, 758179) On that day, they burn in public a devil’s form made of straw to represent untouchability, the day’s programme closing with a common dinner.
('70', 367, 1, 4, 758320) The League has a very ambitious programme and a high sounding motto.
('70', 367, 1, 5, 758389) It seems to me that they will neither serve themselves nor society unless they are thorough in whatever they take up.
('70', 367, 1, 6, 758507) In trying to be thorough they may have to cut out some or even many activities.
('70', 367, 1, 7, 758587) If such be the case, they should not hesitate to do so.
('70', 367, 1, 8, 758643) They seek my advice on spinning as they rightly think I, as the author of the movement, should be able to guide them.
('70', 367, 1, 9, 758761) They call it one of their hobbies.
('70', 367, 1, 10, 758796) But even hobbies need to be thoroughly cultivated if they are to yield the greatest amount of enjoyment.
('70', 367, 1, 11, 758901) They are mistaken in thinking that good yarn has no market.
('70', 367, 1, 12, 758961) If they produce strong and even yarn of 8 counts, it will have a market in Nagercoil.
('70', 367, 1, 13, 759047) I suggest a better use, however, of their yarn.
('70', 367, 1, 14, 759095) They should add weaving to their hobby of spinning.
('70', 367, 1, 15, 759147) If they will do so, the coarse yarn which the beginners will turn out can be woven into tape, nevar, asana, carpets, etc., and the fine into dhotis for men and women.
('70', 367, 1, 16, 759314) They need not seek a market for such wares.
('70', 367, 1, 17, 759358) For they will hardly produce enough for their own personal use.
('70', 367, 1, 18, 759422) If they will specialize in this one hobby, they will sufficiently live up to their motto of service and many young men will most certainly earn a living if they become whole time workers.
('70', 367, 1, 19, 759610) The League has 7,000 members.
('70', 367, 1, 20, 759640) They make a nucleus of true co operative society.
('70', 367, 1, 21, 759690) They can run a store or stores which will sell articles manufactured by the members, and they will be mainly only such articles as the members themselves will require.
('70', 367, 1, 22, 759858) Khadi can assuredly come first in any such co operative activity.
('70', 367, 1, 23, 759924) And Travancore or rather the whole of Kerala is a place where khadi can easily become universal, for the Kerala people, both men and women, have the simplest dress of all India and it is all white.
('70', 367, 1, 24, 760122) Even the border is a late innovation.
('70', 367, 1, 25, 760160) But let the League members remember that spinning includes all the anterior processes beginning with picking of cotton, disengaging it from pods, cleaning, ginning and carding it and turning it into slivers.
('70', 367, 1, 26, 760368) If they are all well done, they are fascinating occupations giving exercise both to the body and the mind.
('70', 367, 1, 27, 760475) If they will turn to spinning in the spirit of scientists, let them read the article ‘What Is Khadi Science?’ 1 in Harijan of the 16th inst.

('70', 368, 3, 4, 760788) SUSHILA,
('70', 368, 4, 5, 760797) You have been shouldering heavy responsibility.
('70', 368, 4, 6, 760845) May God help you.
('70', 368, 4, 7, 760863) But God will help you only if you help yourself.
('70', 368, 4, 8, 760912) If your health is not good nor Sita’s, how long can you keep yourself up?
('70', 368, 4, 9, 760986) If your health improves you can take up a lot of work.
('70', 368, 4, 10, 761041) But you do not observe self control.
('70', 368, 4, 11, 761078) How did you have the miscarriage?
('70', 368, 4, 12, 761112) You two are not children.
('70', 368, 4, 13, 761138) One’s life should become reflective.
('70', 368, 4, 14, 761175) One should acquire control over the senses.
('70', 368, 4, 15, 761219) Why should the senses drag us?
('70', 368, 4, 16, 761250) Is there anything more shameful than that?
('70', 368, 4, 17, 761293) If you exercise control over your food and your personal habits, then your body will become healthy and both of you will be happy.
('70', 368, 4, 18, 761424) And you will be able to handle a lot of Manilal’s work.
('70', 368, 4, 19, 761480) Instead of making Sita a doll, you should start giving her training in domestic chores right from now.
('70', 368, 4, 20, 761583) If your own life is methodical, she will automatically learn a great deal.
('70', 368, 4, 21, 761658) Sita and you should take both types of Kuhne baths.
('70', 368, 4, 22, 761710) You must take to walking for exercise.
('70', 368, 4, 23, 761749) In diet, you should take fruit and things made from whole wheat flour, drink fresh milk and eat green vegetables in moderate quantities.
('70', 368, 4, 24, 761886) If you get fresh milk, there is not much need for ghee.
('70', 368, 4, 25, 761942) You can make such changes in this as experience may suggest.
('70', 368, 4, 26, 762003) Do not feel unhappy about Shanti.
('70', 368, 4, 27, 762037) Be content with whatever service anyone renders.
('70', 368, 4, 28, 762086) If we do not fail in our duty we shall be able to overcome all obstacles.
('70', 368, 5, 29, 762160) Blessings from BAPU [PS.]
('70', 368, 6, 30, 762186) I won’t write a separate letter to Manilal now.

('70', 369, 1, 2, 762362) 385. NEED FOR TOLERANCE 1
('70', 369, 2, 3, 762388) A Mussalman friend had addressed me a long letter of which the following is the gist: 2
('70', 369, 3, 4, 762476) (1) I turned a vegetarian several years ago, being struck by the iniquitous cruelty of slaughtering God’s dumb creatures to provide meat for our tables.
('70', 369, 3, 5, 762629) Ever since then I have completely abjured the taking of meat though meat eating is allowed by Islam.
('70', 369, 3, 6, 762730) But I have not been able to induce my children to abjure meat eating likewise, with the result that I have still to procure meat for them from the bazzar.
('70', 369, 3, 7, 762885) Sometimes, however, I am troubled by a doubt whether this is not all wrong.
('70', 369, 3, 8, 762961) Would I remain a silent witness, if my children took to theft and murder, for instance?
('70', 369, 4, 9, 763049) (2) What I have said with regard to meat also holds good in respect of tea, betel leaf, soda water, lemonade, etc.
('70', 369, 5, 10, 763164) (3) I belong to the trader class and hence am quite conversant with the various shadowy tricks and devices that are in vogue among this class, e.g., how to exploit the inexperience and weakness of the buyer in order to palm off upon him goods that are utterly worthless, charging prices not according to the cost or to any fixed principle but according to what an unwary customer can be made to fork out and so on.
('70', 369, 5, 11, 763579) For years I have felt an innate repugnance against all this which Mrs. Besant once described as “white loot”.
('70', 369, 5, 12, 763689) But I feel utterly helpless.
('70', 369, 6, 13, 763718) (4) You regard Mahomed as a Prophet of God and hold him in high regard.
('70', 369, 6, 14, 763790) You have even publicly spoken of him in the highest terms.
('70', 369, 6, 15, 763849) I have heard and even seen reports in cold print to the effect that you have studied the Koran itself.
('70', 369, 6, 16, 763952) All this, I must confess, has puzzled me.
('70', 369, 6, 17, 763994) I am at a loss to understand how a person like you, with all your passion for truth and justice, who has never failed to gloss over [sic ] a single fault in Hinduism or to repudiate as unauthentic the numerous corruptions that masquerade under it, can holus bolus accept all that is in the Koran.
('70', 369, 6, 18, 764291) I am not aware of your ever having called into question or denounced any iniquitous injunction of Islam.
('70', 369, 6, 19, 764396) Against some of these I learnt to revolt when I was scarcely 18 or 20 years old and time has since only strengthened that first feeling.
('70', 369, 6, 20, 764533) I have tried as far as was possible to retain the language of the original, taking liberty only to soften a few expressions here and there, but have otherwise scrupulously kept the sense intact.
('70', 369, 6, 21, 764728) To come to the

('70', 370, 1, 2, 764937) various points mentioned by my correspondent.
('70', 370, 1, 3, 764983) He deserves to be congratulated on his giving up meat eating and on the various other disciplines that he has cultivated.
('70', 370, 1, 4, 765105) But he may not impose the same on his unwilling or half willing relations or dependents.
('70', 370, 1, 5, 765194) Let him try to touch their hearts and reason by the means of persuasion at his command; but anything more than that before the desired conversion has come about would be compulsion and therefore unjustifiable.
('70', 370, 1, 6, 765404) It would obviously be too much for him to expect the members of his family all of a sudden to break with a life long habit that has never been regarded as contrary to Islam, which is almost universal among the Mussalmans today and till yesterday was followed by the friend in question himself.
('70', 370, 1, 7, 765698) Let him not forget the long years of strenuous introspection and struggle which he took before he arrived at his decision.
('70', 370, 1, 8, 765821) To require now his dependents to adopt that decision at a stroke would only betray impatience on his part.
('70', 370, 1, 9, 765928) The golden rule to be observed always in this connection is that you can never be too severe in dealing with yourself but you must be deliberately liberal in judging others.
('70', 370, 1, 10, 766102) For, experience has shown that no matter how severe we may try to be with regard to ourselves, we shall, in the result, still be found to have acted partially towards ourselves, for the simple reason that our unconscious bias always prepossesses us in our favour and seldom allows the test to be carried beyond our capacity for endurance.
('70', 370, 1, 11, 766441) But in the case of others we do not know their weaknesses and limitations, which are known only to God who alone can read our hearts.
('70', 370, 1, 12, 766575) There is therefore always a danger, with all our desire to be liberal, of our being betrayed into a hollow harshness and intolerance when we proceed to apply our personal standards to others; and paradoxical though it may sound, the more liberal, the more patient, the more considerate we are in such cases, the quicker the results are likely to be; they will certainly be more permanent and lasting.
('70', 370, 2, 13, 766976) The analogy between meat eating and theft or murder drawn by the correspondent in question is altogether untenable.
('70', 370, 2, 14, 767092) Theft and murder, unlike meat eating, are universally held to be crimes and are heavily punishable under the law.
('70', 370, 2, 15, 767206) But even so one may not, in the hypothetical case cited above, try to wean dependents and relations from their career of theft and murder through compulsion.
('70', 370, 2, 16, 767364) My correspondent must, therefore, try to convert members of his household to his view by patient argument alone, tempered by love, and pending their conversion, cultivate an attitude of the broadest tolerance and forbearance towards them.
('70', 371, 0, 1, 767603) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 372
('70', 371, 1, 2, 767645) To proceed to the next question.
('70', 371, 1, 3, 767678) I do not hold dishonest practices in business to be warranted or excusable.
('70', 371, 1, 4, 767754) The principle of unconditional honesty is as binding in this as in any other field of life, and it is up to a business man never to compromise his principle no matter what it may cost him.
('70', 371, 1, 5, 767943) In the end, of course, honesty pays, though that can hardly be a consideration for observing it.
('70', 371, 1, 6, 768040) One has a perfect right to fix and regulate the scale of prices that he shall charge from a particular set of customers, but it must be done according to a clear fixed principle and not out of mere opportunism or immoral expediency.
('70', 371, 1, 7, 768273) There should be in it no room for fraud, sharp practice or finesse, to bamboozle the simple, unsuspecting customer.
('70', 371, 1, 8, 768389) Now for Islam.
('70', 371, 1, 9, 768404) I stand by every word that I have written in that connection.
('70', 371, 1, 10, 768466) I have nowhere said that I believe literally in every word of the Koran, or for the matter of that of any scripture in the world.
('70', 371, 1, 11, 768596) But it is no business of mine to criticize the scriptures of other faiths or to point out their defects.
('70', 371, 1, 12, 768701) It is and should be, however, my privilege to proclaim and practise the truths that there may be in them.
('70', 371, 1, 13, 768807) I may not, therefore, criticize, or condemn things in the Koran or the life of the Prophet that I cannot understand.
('70', 371, 1, 14, 768924) But I welcome every opportu nity to express my admiration for such aspects of his life as I have been able to appreciate and understand.
('70', 371, 1, 15, 769061) As for things that present difficulties, I am content to see them through the eyes of devout Mussalman friends, while I try to understand them with the help of the writings of eminent Muslim expounders of Islam.
('70', 371, 1, 16, 769273) It is only through such a reverential approach to faiths other than mine that I can realize the principle of equality of all religions.
('70', 371, 1, 17, 769409) But it is both my right and duty to point out the defects in Hinduism in order to purify it and to keep it pure.
('70', 371, 1, 18, 769522) But when non Hindu critics set about criticizing Hindu ism and cataloguing its faults they only blazon their own ignorance of Hinduism and their incapacity to regard it from the Hindu viewpoint.
('70', 371, 1, 19, 769717) It distorts their vision and vitiates their judgement.
('70', 371, 1, 20, 769772) Thus my own experience of the non Hindu critics of Hinduism brings home to me my limitations and teaches me to be wary of launching on a criticism of Islam or Christianity and their founders.

('70', 372, 4, 5, 770090) I cannot write with the right hand.
('70', 372, 4, 6, 770126) I will therefore write only a few lines.
('70', 372, 4, 7, 770167) How could I get the time to write during the journey?
('70', 372, 4, 8, 770221) Why do you send your letters by express delivery?
('70', 372, 4, 9, 770271) It was such a long letter and yet there was no substance to it.
('70', 372, 4, 10, 770335) When will you learn to write letters?
('70', 372, 4, 11, 770373) The trip to Belgaum will probably be fixed in the middle of April.
('70', 372, 4, 12, 770440) Let it be when it will.
('70', 372, 4, 13, 770464) I should advise you to come over here and tell me whatever you wish to.

('70', 372, 10, 21, 770754) I will discuss Vinoba’s opinion with him.
('70', 372, 10, 22, 770796) I have not been able to understand it.
('70', 372, 10, 23, 770835) The Goseva Sangh can take over the Goshala of Dhulia without assuming financial responsibility for it.
('70', 372, 10, 24, 770938) But the present trustees of Dhulia would not like it.
('70', 372, 10, 25, 770992) When are you leaving for the Kathiawar tour?
('70', 372, 10, 26, 771037) I think the opinion that you have expressed to Rameshwar regarding ghee is perfectly correct.

('70', 373, 4, 4, 771293) I got your letter.
('70', 373, 4, 5, 771312) Take Rs. 15 from Ramdas.
('70', 373, 4, 6, 771337) Prabhavati will stay on for this month at any rate.
('70', 373, 4, 7, 771389) You may come.
('70', 373, 4, 8, 771403) I am very much afraid of you.
('70', 373, 4, 9, 771433) You are very touchy.
('70', 373, 4, 10, 771454) Even Paparamma is afraid of you, to say nothing of Saraswati.
('70', 373, 4, 11, 771516) Ramachandran is the only one who is not afraid of you.
('70', 373, 4, 12, 771571) But you do not spare him either.
('70', 373, 4, 13, 771604) I absolutely did not understand the meaning of your letters.
('70', 373, 4, 14, 771665) You may read any meaning in my letters that you like.
('70', 373, 4, 15, 771719) I do not at all like the transaction with Kunvarjibhai.
('70', 373, 4, 16, 771775) Please bear in mind that we always go down in the eyes of those from whom we borrow money.
('70', 373, 4, 17, 771866) But there is no question of going down in the eyes of one’s parents.
('70', 373, 4, 18, 771935) We may, therefore, take from them whatever they can give and be satisfied.
('70', 373, 4, 19, 772010) But my yardstick seems to you too big.
('70', 373, 4, 20, 772049) Does it not?
('70', 373, 4, 21, 772062) Big or small, know that that is the only right yardstick for human beings.
('70', 373, 4, 22, 772137) It is not a yardstick for gods.
('70', 373, 4, 23, 772169) Instead of dismissing me as a superhuman being, if you coolly weigh what I am writing in the scales of your reason, it will assuredly do you good.
('70', 373, 4, 24, 772316) When you read and remember it for examination, it is called memory.
('70', 373, 4, 25, 772384) Perhaps it can be cultivated.
('70', 373, 4, 26, 772414) But reason can only be developed by discriminating between good and bad.
('70', 373, 4, 27, 772487) Prabhavati is sleeping.
('70', 373, 4, 28, 772511) But why need I detain the letter?
('70', 373, 4, 29, 772545) I am, therefore, sending it for being posted.
('70', 373, 4, 30, 772591) I myself have sealed it.

('70', 374, 2, 3, 772781) February 1, 1937
('70', 374, 3, 4, 772798) BHAI GOKULBHAI,
('70', 374, 4, 5, 772814) I have your letter about Surajbehn and also the note about Faizpur.
('70', 374, 4, 6, 772882) I have much to say about the kitchen.
('70', 374, 4, 7, 772920) I believe that the work will become very easy if it is entrusted to persons who have the experience of running large messes.
('70', 374, 4, 8, 773045) They too form a part of the nation.
('70', 374, 4, 9, 773081) It is our duty to encourage them and train them.
('70', 374, 4, 10, 773130) They have many short comings.
('70', 374, 4, 11, 773160) Their talent should on no account be ignored.
('70', 374, 4, 12, 773206) I think it is easy to supervise a hundred catering experts and get work from them than to train a thousand volunteers for the kitchen.
('70', 374, 4, 13, 773341) And that is good for the nation as a whole.
('70', 374, 4, 14, 773385) It is true that caterers should be highly efficient.
('70', 374, 4, 15, 773438) I shall be happy if they can serve food to five thousand persons at a time and manage it efficiently.
('70', 374, 4, 16, 773540) I do not think it is an impossible task.
('70', 374, 4, 17, 773581) We do arrange feasts for nine communities.
('70', 374, 4, 18, 773624) Even then it requires training to manage it efficiently.
('70', 374, 4, 19, 773681) The work becomes easy when there is a division of labour.
('70', 374, 4, 20, 773739) Sikhs’ langars are also worth giving thought to.
('70', 374, 4, 21, 773788) You seem to aspire to become the kitchen expert.
('70', 374, 4, 22, 773837) There is nothing wrong in that.
('70', 374, 4, 23, 773869) Wasn’t cooking one of the many accomplishments of Nala?
('70', 374, 4, 24, 773925) So you may become an expert.

('70', 374, 9, 30, 774091) BHAGWANJI,
('70', 374, 10, 31, 774102) I got your letter.
('70', 374, 10, 32, 774121) Chitre’s goodness is beyond doubt.
('70', 374, 10, 33, 774156) But his goodness is now eating him away.
('70', 374, 10, 34, 774197) His sacrifice has become purely egoistic.
('70', 374, 10, 35, 774239) There should be detachment and knowledge even behind sacrifice.
('70', 374, 10, 36, 774303) One sees neither in Chitre at present.
('70', 374, 10, 37, 774342) I have tried very hard to bring him round but have failed completely.
('70', 374, 10, 38, 774412) Perhaps the best service to him may be not to interfere with him in anything he does but give him whatever help he may ask for.
('70', 374, 10, 39, 774540) Perhaps he will learn from

('70', 375, 1, 2, 774608) experience.
('70', 375, 1, 3, 774620) Through egoistic fasts, etc., he has made his mind blank and his body weak.
('70', 375, 1, 4, 774696) He has, therefore, remained fit for nothing.
('70', 375, 1, 5, 774741) If he takes to socialism and can remain cheerful, even then it will be all right.
('70', 375, 1, 6, 774823) I am writing a letter to him and sending it with this.
('70', 375, 1, 7, 774878) Give it to him.
('70', 375, 1, 8, 774894) Please do not worry as you have been doing.
('70', 375, 1, 9, 774938) God is there to look after all.
('70', 375, 1, 10, 774970) He makes some people foolish and some wise.
('70', 375, 1, 11, 775014) His ways are inscrutable.
('70', 375, 1, 12, 775040) Our dharma is simple.
('70', 375, 1, 13, 775062) We should do the duty that has come to us unsought and not worry about the result.
('70', 375, 1, 14, 775145) We need not carry the burden of the world’s woes on our heads nor lose our balance of mind at the sight of its pomp.
('70', 375, 1, 15, 775262) We should not give pain to anybody nor harbour ill will towards anybody.
('70', 375, 1, 16, 775335) We should not grab anybody’s property and should keep our hands clean.
('70', 375, 1, 17, 775406) If we live thus, we have done our duty.
('70', 375, 1, 18, 775446) We can then say like king Janaka: “What does it matter if the city is in flames?”

('70', 375, 7, 26, 775758) Do go abroad but don’t be too eager.
('70', 375, 7, 27, 775795) Do earn money but not for yourself, only for the poor.
('70', 375, 7, 28, 775850) People generally give for the poor from whatever is left after spending on their luxuries.
('70', 375, 7, 29, 775941) Justice lies in earning money for the poor furst and then for ourselves.
('70', 375, 7, 30, 776014) Those who have the talent for earning money should certainly make use of it.
('70', 375, 7, 31, 776091) But the entire earning should be spent in the service of the people.
('70', 375, 7, 32, 776160) I know all your brothers have such an inclination.

('70', 376, 4, 6, 776588) What would happen if you were to get a third?
('70', 376, 4, 7, 776634) It was good that I sealed the letter 1 about the Rs. 15 while Prabha was asleep.
('70', 376, 4, 8, 776715) If I hadn’t done that you would definitely have thought that I had sent you Rs. 15 as fine.
('70', 376, 4, 9, 776807) But why should you demand a fine?
('70', 376, 4, 10, 776841) It was another Kantilal Gandhi that Trivedi saw.
('70', 376, 4, 11, 776890) Thus everbody got a reason to smile after a time of sorrow.
('70', 376, 4, 12, 776950) But what is the difference between Kunvarji and Trivedi?

('70', 376, 4, 14, 777067) I haven’t written to him.
('70', 376, 4, 15, 777093) If, however, I have been able to convince you rationally you should not borrow a single pie from anybody without Devdas’s permission.
('70', 376, 4, 16, 777227) Nor should you spend more than necessary.
('70', 376, 4, 17, 777269) I have no doubt that this will be for your good.

('70', 377, 4, 7, 778063) Here also Krishna 2 and Kanaiyo 3 behaved very well.
('70', 377, 4, 8, 778116) I hope the school is going on all right.
('70', 377, 4, 9, 778157) How is Purushottam 4?

('70', 377, 9, 16, 778350) KRISHNACHANDRA,
('70', 377, 10, 17, 778366) You have been well saved.
('70', 377, 10, 18, 778392) If self control does not come easily to you, you may marry.
('70', 377, 10, 19, 778452) You must practise restraint over food.
('70', 377, 10, 20, 778491) It is very necessary to make slivers with your own hands.
('70', 377, 10, 21, 778549) You should do it.
('70', 377, 10, 22, 778567) What can you gain by further studies?
('70', 377, 10, 23, 778605) You can readily obtain a teaching job provided you do not require a high salary.
('70', 377, 10, 24, 778686) Will you be satisfied with Rs. 75 a month?
('70', 377, 10, 25, 778729) You must now compose yourself.

('70', 378, 2, 3, 779067) SEGAON, February 4, 1937
('70', 378, 4, 4, 779092) It is surprising that you did not receive the letter that I wrote to you from here.
('70', 378, 4, 5, 779176) I have definitely written one.
('70', 378, 4, 6, 779207) I looked into my diary also.
('70', 378, 4, 7, 779236) I wrote the letter on the 25th, i.e., on the next day after my arrival in Segaon.
('70', 378, 4, 8, 779318) Please inquire now.
('70', 378, 4, 9, 779338) After reading this letter Mahadev also will inquire at Maganwadi.
('70', 378, 4, 10, 779404) Do stay on as long as necessary.
('70', 378, 4, 11, 779437) When you come I will treat you as a newcomer.
('70', 378, 4, 12, 779483) All that I want you to do is that while you are there you should strictly follow the rules of this place.
('70', 378, 4, 13, 779589) Take every step after careful thinking.
('70', 378, 4, 14, 779629) The prayer must not be missed, nor should spinning be omitted.
('70', 378, 4, 15, 779692) Only indigenous paper should be used.
('70', 378, 4, 16, 779730) I am glad that Dr. Yodh holds out the fullest hope and is confident.
('70', 378, 4, 17, 779799) If he recovers, Damayanti will be free, from worry.
('70', 378, 4, 18, 779851) If you fix a particular day of the week for writing to me, you will be able to write regularly.
('70', 378, 4, 19, 779947) It would be an excellent thing to fix a definite time for every activity and the practice saves time and the strain of thinking.
('70', 378, 4, 20, 780076) My right hand needs rest.
('70', 378, 4, 21, 780102) On Monday, it has to be used for Harijan work.
('70', 378, 4, 22, 780149) I write a little with my left hand but it consumes more time.
('70', 378, 4, 23, 780211) I, therefore, dictate Gujarati and English letters whenever I can get hold of somebody.

('70', 378, 9, 28, 780462) SUSHILA, MANILAL,
('70', 378, 10, 29, 780480) How is it that you suffer miscarriages so often?
('70', 378, 10, 30, 780529) Both of you should think over this.
('70', 378, 10, 31, 780565) This is a matter in which no one else’s wisdom can help you.
('70', 378, 10, 32, 780626) Those who lead a thoughtful life and are filled with devotion to God, always succeed in finding the right path for themselves.

('70', 379, 1, 2, 780845) You did not have much hope for Shanti from the very beginning.
('70', 379, 1, 3, 780908) You got his services so long as he owed you a debt from his previous life.
('70', 379, 1, 4, 780983) You will have to wind up everything there if you do not succeed in finding anyone to take up your work.
('70', 379, 1, 5, 781087) Isn’t that so?
('70', 379, 1, 6, 781102) I hope Sita is better now.
('70', 379, 1, 7, 781129) Accustom her to hip baths and friction baths.
('70', 379, 1, 8, 781175) Haven’t I already written to you about her food?
('70', 379, 1, 9, 781224) Milk, whole wheat flour in very small quantities, green vegetables like gourd, bitter gourd, amaranth lettuce, etc.
('70', 379, 1, 10, 781340) I see that it is better to eat onions and garlic uncooked.
('70', 379, 1, 11, 781399) Starchy foods like potatoes, etc., should be eaten sparingly or excluded altogether.
('70', 379, 1, 12, 781484) Among fruits, pineapple, oranges, mosambis, grapes and similar juicy fruits.
('70', 379, 1, 13, 781561) I remembered both of you in Faizpur.
('70', 379, 1, 14, 781598) The Congress session in a village was a great success.

('70', 379, 4, 18, 781787) BHAI PRABHASHANKAR,
('70', 379, 5, 19, 781807) As I was touring Travancore, I have been much in arrears with my correspondence.
('70', 379, 5, 20, 781888) Moreover, my hand needs rest nowadays and so I cannot write readily.
('70', 379, 5, 21, 781957) Nor am I able to dictate letters whenever I wish to.
('70', 379, 5, 22, 782010) It seems that you are not taking necessary treatment for your health.
('70', 379, 5, 23, 782080) A disease should be put down the moment its symptoms appear.
('70', 379, 5, 24, 782141) What can I do regarding the suggestions you have made?
('70', 379, 5, 25, 782196) Where is the need to advise the teeth to be considerate to the tongue?
('70', 379, 5, 26, 782267) Champa is your daughter.
('70', 379, 5, 27, 782292) Ratilal is your son in law and so he also is like a son to you.
('70', 379, 5, 28, 782356) Moreover, Ratilal is a cripple, so to say.
('70', 379, 5, 29, 782399) He is, therefore, in no position to oppose you in whatever you do.
('70', 379, 5, 30, 782466) I regard it as your goodness that you consult me.
('70', 379, 5, 31, 782516) But Nanalal is near you, and you have been consulting him.
('70', 379, 5, 32, 782575) That is enough.
('70', 379, 5, 33, 782591) I understand about Balwant.
('70', 379, 5, 34, 782619) One cannot expect much improvement in his mother’s health at this age.
('70', 379, 5, 35, 782690) However, I see in many instances that old age can be made bearable by following nature cure remedies and making necessary changes in diet.
('70', 379, 5, 36, 782829) A diet like a child’s suits best in old age.

('70', 380, 2, 5, 783171) He will write to the latter.
('70', 380, 2, 6, 783200) How is Titus working?
('70', 380, 2, 7, 783222) He has asked for a certificate from me.
('70', 380, 2, 8, 783262) He wants a job somewhere.
('70', 380, 2, 9, 783288) Of course he says that his dairy is doing very well but that he doesn’t get any experience about cattle.
('70', 380, 2, 10, 783393) I have asked him of what use a certificate from me in a technical matter can be.
('70', 380, 2, 11, 783474) How many girls are there?
('70', 380, 2, 12, 783500) What does the expenditure on education, food, etc., come to?

('70', 380, 4, 16, 783700) PANNALAL, I have your letter.
('70', 380, 4, 17, 783730) I will certainly write.
('70', 380, 4, 18, 783754) You will remember I had quoted the doctor’s opinion about milk.
('70', 380, 4, 19, 783818) But what can one do when someone has a strong preference for buffalo milk and ghee?
('70', 380, 4, 20, 783902) If ghee is in demand you must separate milk first and sell the separated milk at a very low price.
('70', 380, 4, 21, 784001) You must bring out pamphlets pointing out its qualities.
('70', 380, 4, 22, 784058) That milk can be sold at a very low price among the working classes and the poor.
('70', 380, 4, 23, 784140) It can also be turned into curds.
('70', 380, 4, 24, 784174) Many delicacies can be prepared from it.
('70', 380, 4, 25, 784215) Many things can be devised in times of difficulty.
('70', 380, 4, 26, 784266) The primary thing is to persuade the people that it is their duty not to use buffalo milk and have only cow’s milk.
('70', 380, 4, 27, 784382) Once they are convinced, we shall have found a key to solve whatever difficulties may arise and however insurmountable they may seem.
('70', 380, 4, 28, 784516) I shall await your letter regarding the new charkha.

('70', 381, 2, 3, 784766) Unnrevised SEGAON, February 5, 1937
('70', 381, 4, 4, 784802) My right hand needs rest and it takes time to write with the left hand.
('70', 381, 4, 5, 784874) How can I spare that much time?
('70', 381, 4, 6, 784906) The burden of work has increased considerably and so I dictate most of the things I have to write.
('70', 381, 4, 7, 785005) On Mondays I make full use of my right hand.
('70', 381, 4, 8, 785050) The amanuenses are Vijaya and Manu, and also sometimes Prabhavati.
('70', 381, 4, 9, 785117) Probably you do not know Vijaya.
('70', 381, 4, 10, 785150) She is a Patel woman and hails from Bardoli.
('70', 381, 4, 11, 785195) She has, so to say, forced herself on us, for we had made a firm rule not to make any fresh admission.
('70', 381, 4, 12, 785298) Vijaya prevailed upon us to break that rule.
('70', 381, 4, 13, 785343) She put her case in such a manner that I could not send her away.
('70', 381, 4, 14, 785409) So far I have not regretted admitting her.
('70', 381, 4, 15, 785452) She goes on doing her work silently and makes up for Lilavati’s absence.
('70', 381, 4, 16, 785525) Shankarrao must be all right now.
('70', 381, 4, 17, 785559) I have asked Haribhau Phatak to give me news about his health.
('70', 381, 4, 18, 785622) But I think you will be able to give detailed news.
('70', 381, 4, 19, 785674) I had told Patwardhan that he could come whenever he wished.
('70', 381, 4, 20, 785735) But, then, don’t the hills seem beautiful only from a distance, as they say?
('70', 381, 4, 21, 785812) You seem to be going through a fairly severe test.
('70', 381, 4, 22, 785863) It is at once easy and difficult to put more money in villagers’ pockets.
('70', 381, 4, 23, 785937) If they follow our advice, we can, without any capital or with a minimum of it, double the earnings of all villages.
('70', 381, 4, 24, 786054) I am not including in this the money earned from villages by those who exploit the villagers.
('70', 381, 4, 25, 786148) If, however, they do not follow our advice, that is, refuse to do the work suggested by us or to learn the crafts we try to teach them, it is not only difficult but impossible to increase their earnings.
('70', 381, 4, 26, 786352) Another big difficulty is this.
('70', 381, 4, 27, 786384) Only a handful of workers are willing to go to villages, and they, too, are inexperienced.
('70', 381, 4, 28, 786475) Their bodies are not accustomed to the hardships of village life.
('70', 381, 4, 29, 786541) They don’t know the villagers’ nature and are ignorant of their needs.
('70', 381, 4, 30, 786612) They cannot use their hands or their intelligence.
('70', 381, 4, 31, 786663) The knowledge acquired by them in schools and colleges is of little use to them.
('70', 381, 4, 32, 786744) In these circumstances we have to be patient.
('70', 381, 4, 33, 786790) We should have faith in ourselves.
('70', 381, 4, 34, 786825) If the villagers
('70', 382, 0, 1, 786842) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 BEBRUARY, 1937 383
('70', 382, 1, 2, 786891) possess sound health, even without Government help we can improve the economic condition of villages considerably, say, to the extent of 50 per cent.
('70', 382, 1, 3, 787041) I mention 50 per cent as the minimum.
('70', 382, 1, 4, 787079) My belief is that we can improve it to the extent of 90 per cent.
('70', 382, 1, 5, 787145) Improvement in physical health, social reform and moral uplift, these are the three main things.
('70', 382, 1, 6, 787242) They require no Government help at all.
('70', 382, 1, 7, 787282) If we get a little Government help only in economic improvement, our task would be very much easier.
('70', 382, 1, 8, 787383) But in the absence of progress in respect of the foregoing three things, Government help will be of little use.
('70', 382, 1, 9, 787495) If, therefore, you become a real expert in the science of khadi and refuse to leave the village despite all temptations, you will realize from first hand experience the truth of all that I have said above.
('70', 382, 1, 10, 787701) You are not doing right in not insisting on cow’s milk.
('70', 382, 1, 11, 787757) Whenever you go out, you can carry with you ghee and pendas made from cow’s milk.
('70', 382, 1, 12, 787839) The pendas should be without sugar, i.e., made from mava only.
('70', 382, 1, 13, 787902) If you wish, you may eat jaggery with it.
('70', 382, 1, 14, 787944) This keeps down the expense and fully meets one’s requirement of milk.
('70', 382, 1, 15, 788015) Instead of eating dry pendas you can turn them into powder and mix them in warm water to make milk.
('70', 382, 1, 16, 788115) Such milk lacks only vitamins, but absence of vitamins from the diet for a few days does no harm.
('70', 382, 1, 17, 788213) Narmada is Narmada Rana.
('70', 382, 1, 18, 788238) This whole episode is a pitiable one.
('70', 382, 1, 19, 788276) It is perfectly easy to understand that everybody cannot observe life long brahmacharya.
('70', 382, 1, 20, 788365) Those who cannot curb their physical senses may by all means marry.
('70', 382, 1, 21, 788433) But I cannot tolerate secret indulgence.
('70', 382, 1, 22, 788474) Man falls through such secret indulgence for no restraints are observed then.
('70', 382, 1, 23, 788552) I have no prejudice at all against grihasthashrama.
('70', 382, 1, 24, 788604) It is a necessary state, and a beautiful one.
('70', 382, 1, 25, 788650) But, being an ashrama, it has dharma at its heart.
('70', 382, 1, 26, 788701) Grihasthadharma is a fine thing, but self indulgence is reprehensible.
('70', 382, 1, 27, 788772) My opposition is solely to self indulgence.
('70', 382, 1, 28, 788816) Jamnalal’s question to you was perfectly right.
('70', 382, 1, 29, 788864) He wanted to know your point of view as a woman.
('70', 382, 1, 30, 788913) Whatever Vinoba, I or others may say, it is very necessary to know what a mature and pure woman feels.
('70', 382, 1, 31, 789016) And ultimately the real contribution has to be made by the woman.
('70', 382, 1, 32, 789082) The burden of demonstrating the importance and necessity of brahmacharya should not be on man alone.
('70', 382, 1, 33, 789183) Till now it has been mostly shouldered by him, and in consequence it has become his
('70', 383, 0, 1, 789267) THE COLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 384
('70', 383, 1, 2, 789308) This has earned a bad name for Brahmacharya.
('70', 383, 1, 3, 789353) What is more, though it should have been easy to observe, it has proved so difficult that most people find it impossible to observe.
('70', 383, 1, 4, 789486) In this, too, I blame mostly man.
('70', 383, 1, 5, 789520) He has done his best to keep woman his inferior.
('70', 383, 1, 6, 789569) Flattery and brute force have played an equal part in this.
('70', 383, 1, 7, 789629) Be that as it may, one half of man’s body became and has remained weak.
('70', 383, 1, 8, 789701) The result has been that man has failed in most of his endeavours, as he deserved to do.
('70', 383, 1, 9, 789790) There is some awakening among women now.
('70', 383, 1, 10, 789831) But at present it is assuming a perverted form.
('70', 383, 1, 11, 789879) Man has been indulging her whims and feeding her ego under the pretext of respecting her freedom and woman has taken freedom to mean self indulgence.
('70', 383, 1, 12, 790029) Let those men and women who can save themselves from this do so.
('70', 383, 1, 13, 790094) Save yourself.

('70', 383, 7, 18, 790246) February 5, 1937
('70', 383, 8, 19, 790263) BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
('70', 383, 9, 20, 790281) My right hand needs rest.
('70', 383, 9, 21, 790307) I must keep it fit for Monday.
('70', 383, 10, 22, 790338) therefore, give it rest on the other days.
('70', 383, 11, 23, 790381) You are ruthlessly tyrannizing over your body.
('70', 383, 11, 24, 790428) But who can call
('70', 383, 12, 25, 790445) a Sardar to account or restrain him?
('70', 383, 12, 26, 790482) If you impair your health, you will have to hear quite a few things from me.
('70', 383, 12, 27, 790559) So much by way of a preface.
('70', 383, 13, 28, 790588) Chandrashanker1 writes to Mahadev and says that you didn’t
('70', 383, 14, 29, 790647) like my letter2 to Polak.
('70', 383, 14, 30, 790673) I had no option but to give him a letter.
('70', 383, 14, 31, 790715) I had to give a reply.
('70', 383, 14, 32, 790738) If he wanted a letter, I couldn’t but give it.
('70', 383, 14, 33, 790785) I didn’t know that he would immediately publish it.
('70', 383, 14, 34, 790837) But no harm has been done by its publication.
('70', 383, 14, 35, 790883) Even if some harm results, it can only be temporary, for the publication of what is true can never do any real harm.
('70', 383, 15, 36, 791000) Chandrashanker’s letter also mentions the conversation with .
('70', 383, 16, 37, 791062) The report was certainly reprehensible.
('70', 383, 16, 38, 791102) But I am not responsible for it.

('70', 384, 1, 2, 791294) He did exactly the opposite of what I had told him.
('70', 384, 1, 3, 791346) I had plainly declined to express any opinion and had advised him to complain to you.
('70', 384, 1, 4, 791432) I also explained to him that I had no right to intervene in the matter.
('70', 384, 1, 5, 791504) In the end I dictated a general principle.
('70', 384, 1, 6, 791547) He has done no harm in publishing that , of course.
('70', 384, 1, 7, 791599) What are we to do when somebody thus publishes a false report?
('70', 384, 1, 8, 791662) As soon as I saw the report, I wrote a strong letter of protest to him.
('70', 384, 1, 9, 791734) But the man is shameless.
('70', 384, 1, 10, 791760) He has not even acknowledged the letter.
('70', 384, 1, 11, 791801) Do you wish that I should issue contradiction?
('70', 384, 1, 12, 791848) If I do so, he will be ruined.
('70', 384, 1, 13, 791879) If you want, you may tell anybody that I had categorically refused to intervene.
('70', 384, 1, 14, 791960) When are you coming this way?
('70', 384, 1, 15, 791990) Where do you wish the Congress to be held?
('70', 384, 1, 16, 792033) The prepara tions must start from now on.

('70', 384, 4, 19, 792153) 403. WHAT IS NON VIOLENCE?
('70', 384, 5, 20, 792180) MY DEAR MAHATMAJI,
('70', 384, 6, 21, 792199) As you were fully engaged with the Congress affairs these past few weeks, I did not before now acknowledge your postcard which you kindly wrote in reply to my query about ‘non violence in word’ nor thanked you for your courtesy in discussing at length the point at issue in the Harijan of December 19th.
('70', 384, 6, 22, 792503) 1 I have carefully read and weighed your argument, but I cannot help believing that you were not non violent in the words you used with reference to the missionaries in general who have been working, and working so nobly, for the good of our motherland for the past hundred years.
('70', 384, 7, 23, 792784) You say: ‘The essence of violence is that there must be a violent intention behind a thought, word or act, i.e., an intention to do harm to the opponent so called’.
('70', 384, 7, 24, 792949) I don’t think you are right here.
('70', 384, 7, 25, 792983) Take, for instance, a father smacking the face of his unruly and intractable child for some offence or other.
('70', 384, 7, 26, 793093) No one could for a moment believe that there was ‘a voilent intention behind’ that act of the father or that he had ‘an intention to do harm’ to his own child.
('70', 384, 7, 27, 793253) Nevertheless that smacking of the child was an act of violence,
('70', 384, 8, 28, 793317) 1 Vide “What is Non violence?”, 19 12 1936
('70', 385, 0, 1, 793360) THE COLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 386
('70', 385, 1, 2, 793401) pure and simple, because it hurt the child’s face.
('70', 385, 1, 3, 793452) Similarly, when a man uses words against his ‘opponent so called’ which are likely to hurt his feelings or, as you put it, wound his susceptibilities, then quite regardless of his non violent intention behind his word, he has been violent in word simply because he has hurt his so called opponent’s feelings, just as the father hurt his child’s face in the instance given.
('70', 385, 1, 4, 793825) You say further on: ‘The acid test of non violence is that one thinks, speaks and acts non violently even when there is the gravest provocation to be violent.’ Here again I do not agree with you.
('70', 385, 1, 5, 794021) The acid test of non violence is that one thinks, speaks and acts in a manner so as not to hurt ‘the opponent so called’ in body, mind or spirit, even when there is the gravest provocation to be violent.
('70', 385, 1, 6, 794225) It is true where you say: “If non violence of thought is to be evolved in individuals or societies or nations, truth has to be told, however harsh or unpopular it may appear to be for the moment.’ But it is not true that harsh truth must be told in harsh words, when a gentler mode of expressing the same ideas might have, with a little more patience, self control and goodwill, been used against the party opposing.
('70', 385, 1, 7, 794642) In that discussion how strong in contrast stood Mr. Andrews’ gentler mode of arguing to the harsh mode of your expression!
('70', 385, 1, 8, 794765) In this harshness which you, Mahatmaji, with your habitual and exemplary calm, patience and self control might have easily avoided, lay, I repeat, your ‘violence in word’ against the missionaries in general.
('70', 385, 2, 9, 794973) With my best wishes for your health and strength,
('70', 385, 3, 10, 795023) As always yours, A. S. WADIA POONA Jan.
('70', 385, 3, 11, 795063) 10, 1937 PS.
('70', 385, 4, 12, 795076) You are at liberty to print this letter in my name in the Harijan, if you so
('70', 385, 5, 13, 795153) I gladly publish the foregoing.
('70', 385, 5, 14, 795185) But I profoundly differ from the view presented by Shri Wadia.
('70', 385, 5, 15, 795248) The smacking of a boy, if it is not done out of anger and impatience, is most decidedly not violence as when he is, say, bitten by a snake and it is necessary to keep him awake or as when a youngster in high fever was running amuck and came to his senses only after he was severely smacked.
('70', 385, 5, 16, 795539) It caused hurt, but he would most assuredly have died if he had not been smacked.
('70', 385, 5, 17, 795621) Every surgeon causes hurt, but he is every time not only not violent but benevolent and receives thanks and heavy fees for causing hurt, sometimes very serious indeed.
('70', 385, 5, 18, 795789) He does not conform to Shri Wadia’s
('70', 386, 0, 1, 795825) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 BEBRUARY, 1937 387
('70', 386, 1, 2, 795874) definition, he does wholly conform to mine.
('70', 386, 1, 3, 795918) According to my learned correspondent, Jesus Christ was hopelessly violent when he called some people of his times ‘a generation of vipers’.
('70', 386, 1, 4, 796059) His phrases and his actions so hurt his generation that they compassed his death.
('70', 386, 1, 5, 796141) And if truth can be harsh, as the writer admits it can be, what is the gentle way of uttering it so that you can render it proof against your opponent’s wrath?
('70', 386, 1, 6, 796301) If a man utters a downright lie or commits a daylight robbery or a murder, am I to call this brother of mine, as he most assuredly is, a liar or a thief or a murderer, or am I to use Churchillian language and say ‘he perambulates round the suburbs of veracity,’ or ‘he helps himself to the goods that do not belong to him without perhaps any intention of stealing,’ or, ‘he spills innocent blood, though perhaps he does not want to kill?’ And if I were to use such circumlocutory speech, is there the slightest guarantee that I shall never hurt the party of whom I may be speaking?
('70', 386, 1, 7, 796883) Harsh truth may be uttered courteously and gently, but the words would read hard.
('70', 386, 1, 8, 796965) To be truthful you must call a liar a liar—a harsh word perhaps, but the use is inevitable.
('70', 386, 1, 9, 797057) In the instance to which Shri Wadia has taken exception, I have no sense of repentance.
('70', 386, 1, 10, 797145) I suggest to my friend that like many good people he has allowed his judgment to be warped by the nobility of the actions of missionaries in that they have founded schools, hospitals and the like.
('70', 386, 1, 11, 797342) Whereas, giving the fullest due for their philanthropic activities, my sober judgment tells me that the lustre of their deeds is diminished by the motive of proselytizing that lies behind them.
('70', 386, 1, 12, 797536) I may be wrong in my estimate of religious conduct and proselytizing itself.
('70', 386, 1, 13, 797613) That does not make my characterization in any sense violent.
('70', 386, 1, 14, 797674) Therefore I am not going to subscribe to Shri Wadia’s judgment or his comparison of Deenabandhu Andrews at my expense in matters of non violence.
('70', 386, 1, 15, 797820) And if he really believes that I am gifted with ‘habitual and exemplary calm, patience and self control’, I want to assure him that on the occasion referred to I had not lost any of the virtues he imputes to me.
('70', 386, 1, 16, 798032) This is not to say that I never lose self control.
('70', 386, 1, 17, 798083) I do indeed, and those are occasions of my shame.
('70', 386, 1, 18, 798133) If Shri Wadia has had no occasion to observe them it is because of the hard training I have given myself of exercising self control in public life and especially in respect of those who regard me as their enemy.
('70', 386, 1, 19, 798345) But I cannot say the same of my private life.
('70', 386, 1, 20, 798391) Those who are nearest me do alas!
('70', 386, 1, 21, 798425) know how impatient I can be with them, even to the extent of behaving like a wild bear let loose.
('70', 386, 1, 22, 798523) I know that even with them I must
('70', 387, 0, 1, 798557) THE COLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 388
('70', 387, 1, 2, 798598) not lose patience.
('70', 387, 1, 3, 798617) They very generously suffer me for they are quite sure that I mean no ill to them but am their best friend and guide.
('70', 387, 1, 4, 798735) Their certificate, however, is of little worth to me.
('70', 387, 1, 5, 798789) It has never deceived me.
('70', 387, 1, 6, 798815) I know that I would be a better man and their better guide if I could regard them with sufficient detachment and not take it amiss when, in my opinion, they fall short of the standard they have themselves accepted for their daily conduct.
('70', 387, 1, 7, 799054) But the detachment prescribed by the Gita is the hardest thing to achieve, and yet it is so absolutely necessary for perfect peace for the vision of both the little self and the greatest Self.

('70', 387, 3, 9, 799265) 404. KHADI IN ANDHRADESH
('70', 387, 4, 10, 799290) Whilst I was taking the meeting on the 23rd January last at Guntur, the following letter from Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya was put in my hands:
('70', 387, 5, 11, 799430) Your programme in Andhradesh is so short and so congested that I do not feel justified in obtruding myself upon your notice to the detriment of others’ chances.
('70', 387, 5, 12, 799591) But I am tempted to request you to make a pointed reference if possible in your Bezwada speech in regard to the position of khaddar in Andhradesh where some of the certified producers are taking advantage of the increase in prices without observing the conditions essential to such increase.
('70', 387, 5, 13, 799883) But both the certified and A.I.S.A. sales have fallen on account of competition of the uncertified producers who are obviously at an advantage, even granting that they sell pure khaddar.
('70', 387, 5, 14, 800070) A manifesto has been drafted and is being influentially signed by friends representing all shades of opinion in Andhra, a copy of which is enclosed.
('70', 387, 5, 15, 800219) In one word the sales have gone down in certified shops, and the public may therefore be warned by you against the purchase of uncertified cloth; and the new definition of khaddar as ‘hand spun and hand woven cloth prepared on the increased wage’ may be given publicity once again.
('70', 387, 5, 16, 800501) I may add that while most of the certified people are being decertified on account of lapses, a few have sought decertification voluntarily for the obvious advantages it brings under the present conditions, and that is a lesson by itself to us that their sales not only do not suffer but improve by decertification.
('70', 387, 5, 17, 800817) So it is the public that must cultivate the right judgment in the matter.
('70', 387, 5, 18, 800891) There was no time to refer to it at the meeting and I would not mix up khadi work with an appeal for funds for cyclone relief.
('70', 388, 0, 1, 801018) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 BEBRUARY, 1937 389
('70', 388, 1, 2, 801067) not therefore refer to it even in my subsequent speech at Bezwada.
('70', 388, 1, 3, 801134) The subject matter of the letter is nevertheless very important.
('70', 388, 1, 4, 801199) Andhra has possibilities not open to any other province.
('70', 388, 1, 5, 801256) It has an innate skill which the other provinces do not possess.
('70', 388, 1, 6, 801321) But some Andhra merchants, as elsewhere, are greedy and for a paltry coppers would injure even khadi, the mainstay of the villagers, the staff of Daridranarayana and the indispensable friend of the widow.
('70', 388, 1, 7, 801526) What is worse, however, is want of co operation among even the tallest khadi workers.
('70', 388, 1, 8, 801612) Among the causes of Andhra’s fall in the matter of khadi I had a painful eye opener at Vinaya Ashram.
('70', 388, 1, 9, 801714) Everybody in Andhradesh knows my partiality for Sitarama Sastry and my regard for Deshabhakta Venkatappayya.
('70', 388, 1, 10, 801823) The former is the disciple of the latter.
('70', 388, 1, 11, 801865) Deshabhakta’s word is law for Sitarama Sastry.
('70', 388, 1, 12, 801912) Both are all the emotion in which Andhra seems to have specialized.
('70', 388, 1, 13, 801980) But Venkata ppayya is a weak guru—generous and forgiving to a fault.
('70', 388, 1, 14, 802049) My partiality for Sitarama Sastry kept me in ignorance of what in my opinion was an unpardonable omission in a khadi lover and representative of the A.I.S.A. On reaching Vinaya Ashram in the dark hours of the morning of 23rd ultimo, I asked for a wheel and was shocked to discover that they had 19 wheels which were out of order and not in use.
('70', 388, 1, 15, 802394) They had a Yeravda Chakra which was produced but which was also out of order, though not wholly unworkable.
('70', 388, 1, 16, 802502) They had no carding bow.
('70', 388, 1, 17, 802527) And to my dismay I found that no one knew carding in Vinaya Ashram and that those who span did so with slivers purchased in the market.
('70', 388, 1, 18, 802663) My heart wept.
('70', 388, 1, 19, 802678) I gave vent to my feeling of grief and disppointment.
('70', 388, 1, 20, 802732) I quoted in bitterness, ‘if the salt loseth its savour, wherewith shall it be salted?’ Poor Sitarama Sastry was dumb.
('70', 388, 1, 21, 802850) Tears trickled down Venkatappayya’s cheeks.
('70', 388, 1, 22, 802894) And during our rush in motor cars Venkatappayya promised to repair the blunder in two months’ time, and said in tones of confidence that Sastry would prepare himself in the manner I expected and that the Vinaya Ashram would hum with the sweet sound of the charkha and the carding bow.
('70', 388, 1, 23, 803179) Sitarama Sastry was present and he vowed to redeem the promise of his chief.
('70', 388, 1, 24, 803256) To err—even grievously—is human.
('70', 388, 1, 25, 803289) But it is human only if there is a determination to mend the error and not to repeat it.
('70', 388, 1, 26, 803378) The error will be forgotten if the promise is fully redeemed.
('70', 388, 1, 27, 803440) And I know both these friends too well to fear that it will not be redeemed.
('70', 388, 1, 28, 803517) Now the reader will realize why khadi has not made the progress it should have.
('70', 388, 1, 29, 803597) It has made progress worthy of note because it has
('70', 389, 0, 1, 803648) THE COLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 390
('70', 389, 1, 2, 803689) innate virtue.
('70', 389, 1, 3, 803704) But it cannot cover every village unless the agents of the A.I.S.A. fulfill the expectations they know they have to fulfil.
('70', 389, 1, 4, 803828) They must know at least the elements of the science of khadi in terms of the questions I published the other day.
('70', 389, 1, 5, 803942) Much more searching questions have to be answered by a master of the science of khadi.
('70', 389, 1, 6, 804029) Let not any reader run away with the idea that I have strayed from the simple subject matter of Dr. Pattabhi’s letter.
('70', 389, 1, 7, 804148) That is merely a symptom of the disease whose root cause I have ventured to bring to light.
('70', 389, 1, 8, 804240) When Vinaya Ashram installs the wheel as the central sun in its fulness, uncertified dealers will for the very shame cease to stab Daridranarayana in the back by hampering the experiment of giving the lowest paid workers, the spinners, their due.

('70', 389, 10, 23, 805021) CHIMANLAL, I got your letter.
('70', 389, 10, 24, 805051) Sharda has reached an age when, unless she offers her sincere co operation, she cannot improve.
('70', 389, 10, 25, 805147) In my opinion, at present her only duty is to build up good health.
('70', 389, 10, 26, 805215) For that she should give up study.
('70', 389, 10, 27, 805250) This does not mean that she should read nothing.
('70', 389, 10, 28, 805299) She may by all means read something that she will enjoy reading.
('70', 389, 10, 29, 805364) But she should feel no strain at all in that.
('70', 389, 10, 30, 805410) She should stop reading the
('70', 390, 0, 1, 805438) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 BEBRUARY, 1937 391
('70', 390, 1, 2, 805487) moment she feels tired.
('70', 390, 1, 3, 805511) She should read nothing regularly but should do physical labour daily.
('70', 390, 1, 4, 805582) She should take slow walks in the open air at regular hours.
('70', 390, 1, 5, 805643) She should have hip baths and friction baths.
('70', 390, 1, 6, 805689) She should do slow pranayama.There is no harm at all in having hip baths in the condition that you have described, provided that at the time of taking the bath she does not feel cold.
('70', 390, 1, 7, 805873) After leaving the tub she should do light exercise and pour warm water over the body.
('70', 390, 1, 8, 805959) The whole body should be massaged daily.
('70', 390, 1, 9, 806000) She should take sun bath, without any clothes on.
('70', 390, 1, 10, 806050) This can be easily done in any open place.
('70', 390, 1, 11, 806093) An enclosure can be made by hanging mats all round to ensure privacy.
('70', 390, 1, 12, 806163) If sun bath is taken on a sand covered ground like what we have in a gymnasium, she can take the bath even rolling on the ground.
('70', 390, 1, 13, 806293) This treatment involves no expense.
('70', 390, 1, 14, 806329) All that is neccessary is to have faith and to spare the necessary time.
('70', 390, 1, 15, 806402) If there is no faith, the treatment may become a burden and cause strain on the mind.
('70', 390, 1, 16, 806488) An asthmatic person can never afford strain.
('70', 390, 1, 17, 806533) Nerves play a very important part in causing asthma.
('70', 390, 1, 18, 806586) If Sharda’s diet does not include milk and butter, she should get suffcient ghee.
('70', 390, 1, 19, 806668) She may eat fenugreek leaves, amarnath, mustard leaves, dabho and other green leaves, uncooked ripe tomatoes, gourd, brinjals, pumpkin, etc.
('70', 390, 1, 20, 806809) These things should be steam cooked.
('70', 390, 1, 21, 806846) No condiment should be used not even oil or ghee for frying.
('70', 390, 1, 22, 806907) Ghee or butter may be added afterwards.
('70', 390, 1, 23, 806947) She should eat some juicy friut if available.
('70', 390, 1, 24, 806993) She may eat fresh garlic crushed and mixed with vegetables.
('70', 390, 1, 25, 807053) Ler her start with half a tola.
('70', 390, 1, 26, 807085) It must not be cooked at all.
('70', 390, 1, 27, 807115) She may eat onions also, either cooked or raw.
('70', 390, 1, 28, 807162) Both will benefit her.
('70', 390, 1, 29, 807185) You may ask about anything else if you want to.

('70', 390, 5, 33, 807329) Some of the points of dispute which arose between the mill owners and mill workers of Ahmedabad, were referred for arbitration and its result has been announced.
('70', 390, 5, 34, 807491) Both the parties deserve to be congratulated on their having agreed to refer the issue to arbitration in this manner.
('70', 390, 5, 35, 807609) And the mill owners also on having accepted the Award.
('70', 390, 5, 36, 807664) The Umpire also deserves to be congratulated on having given his Award along with many arguments merely out of a spirit of service
('70', 391, 0, 1, 807795) THE COLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 392
('70', 391, 1, 2, 807836) without charging any fee.
('70', 391, 1, 3, 807862) All of us hope that all disputes arising between the two parties will always be speedily resolved through arbitration.
('70', 391, 1, 4, 807981) It is clear enough for everyone to understand that by accepting the Award of the Umpire both the parties, as also the industry on which the prosperity of Ahmedabad depends, have gained.
('70', 391, 1, 5, 808167) But my object in writing this article is not to examine the situation in the past or to praise the principal parties concerned.
('70', 391, 1, 6, 808295) My object is to find means by which future security could be ensured.
('70', 391, 1, 7, 808365) I have hinted at these means in clause 16 of my Award.
('70', 391, 1, 8, 808420) I quote it below along with the clause that follows:
('70', 391, 2, 9, 808473) At this stage I would like to restate the principles that for the good of both parties I have presented to them as a result of my close and unbroken contact with the industry for a period of 18 years in the capacity of Arbitrator.
('70', 391, 3, 10, 808704) (a) No cut should be made till the mills have ceased to make any profit and are obliged to fall back upon their capital for continuing the industry.
('70', 391, 4, 11, 808853) (b) There should be no cut till the wages have reached the level adequate for maintenance.
('70', 391, 4, 12, 808944) It is impossible to conceive a time when the workmen have begun to regard the industry as if it were their own property and they would then be prepared to help it out of a crisis by taking the barest maintenance consisting of a dry crust and working day and night.
('70', 391, 4, 13, 809209) That would be a voluntary arrangement.
('70', 391, 4, 14, 809248) Such cases are irrlevant to the present consideration.
('70', 391, 5, 15, 809303) (c) There should be a common undestanding as to what should be included in determining a living wage.
('70', 391, 6, 16, 809405) (d) The consideration of the deterioration in individual mills cannot form part of a case for a cut in wages of labour in general.
('70', 391, 7, 17, 809536) (e) It is vital to the well being of the industry that workmen should be regarded as equals with the shareholders and that they have therefore every right to possess an accurate knowledge of the transactions of the mills.
('70', 391, 8, 18, 809758) (f) There should be a register of all available mill hands acceptable to both the parties and the custom of taking labour through any other than the T.L.A. should be stopped,
('70', 391, 9, 19, 809933) I have not presented these principles in the belief that they will be acceptable either to my brother Arbitrator or to the mill owners or even to the workmen.
('70', 391, 9, 20, 810092) These have not guided my decision in the present case but I am convinced that without the acceptance of these principles the industry i.e., the owners and the workmen are in danger.
('70', 392, 0, 1, 810274) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 BEBRUARY, 1937 393
('70', 392, 1, 2, 810323) The Umpire has described these principles as idealistic and incapable of being implemented.
('70', 392, 1, 3, 810415) 1 He did not have to pass judgment on those points.
('70', 392, 1, 4, 810467) I had merely jotted them down in my Award for my own satisfaction and with the object that they might prove useful to both parties in future.
('70', 392, 1, 5, 810609) Hence, it is possible that the Umpire has not given serious thought to them.
('70', 392, 1, 6, 810686) And as I have a reputation for being an idealist, a dreamer and an unpractical person, the Umpire did not fully examine these principles, as he was not bound to do, and it is likely that he did not approve of them because of the unfavourable impression he had of the person who had put them forward.
('70', 392, 2, 7, 810986) I must accept the allegation that I make my ideal the standard by which to judge others.
('70', 392, 2, 8, 811075) But I must also say that I am no enemy of what is practical.
('70', 392, 2, 9, 811136) My life has been spent, and is still being spent, in putting the ideal into practice.
('70', 392, 2, 10, 811222) I believe that I have achived some success in my effort.
('70', 392, 2, 11, 811279) I entreat the two parties and the readers to forget me and examine the principles which I have put forward independently.
('70', 392, 3, 12, 811401) The Umpire has strongly recommended that mill owners should speedily take a decision regarding the scale of wages applicable to all mills and with the same speed frame a scheme whereby an increase or decrease in wages can be effected automatically.
('70', 392, 3, 13, 811650) In my humble opinion, while trying to implement these two points speedily, the assistance of the principles suggested by me in one form or another will become indispensable.
('70', 392, 3, 14, 811824) In addition to the principles put forward by me, others no doubt will have to be thought out.
('70', 392, 3, 15, 811918) Nevertheless a consideration of the principles suggested by me is necessary.
('70', 392, 4, 16, 811995) The first point that has to be settled in the scheme for automatic decrease or increase in wages is the lowest point in wage reduction.
('70', 392, 4, 17, 812131) While deciding this one factor, all my six points will have to be taken into consideration.
('70', 392, 4, 18, 812223) It may well not be accepted that a wage cut can be made only when mills have ceased to make any profit; but a ceiling on profits should definitely be laid down.
('70', 392, 4, 19, 812384) In giving a practicable shape to this there is no escape from making absence of profit, that is to say, the ideal, our standard.
('70', 392, 5, 20, 812513) 1 The Umpire’s Award said “Even while I do homage to their idealistic and humanitarian spirit, they are, I think, inconsistent with the hard realities of economic poduction for profit and survival by competiation in an open market.
('70', 392, 5, 21, 812745) (History of Wage Adjustments in the Ahmedabad Industry, Vol. IV, p.
('70', 393, 0, 1, 812813) THE COLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 394
('70', 393, 1, 2, 812854) Before fixing a standard for wage cut it is necessary to decide what should be called a living wage.
('70', 393, 1, 3, 812955) (16 B) If a consideration of the living wage is regarded as essential, it is absolutely necessary to consider what are the items to be included in it.
('70', 393, 1, 4, 813106) (16 C) While considering a cut in the wages of the entire body of workers a consideration of the plight of any individual mill necessarily becomes irrelevant.
('70', 393, 1, 5, 813265) (16 D) In order that workers may be able to accept the demands of the mill owners they should have the right to know about the detailed working of the mill.
('70', 393, 1, 6, 813422) (16 E) And, in order that workers may willingly accept a cut in wages and to reassure them, it will become absolutely necessary to keep a register of all possible labourers.
('70', 393, 1, 7, 813596) (16 F) The Mill owners’ Association will have to gain greater control over the mills than it enjoys at present if the principle of arbitration is to become permanent.
('70', 393, 1, 8, 813763) It will collapse if the individuals ignore the Mill owners’ Association while pursuing their own interests alone.
('70', 393, 1, 9, 813877) Similarly, if workers pursue their own interest and violate the rules of the Labout Association the principle of arbitration will cease to operate.
('70', 393, 1, 10, 814025) In order to prevent such an eventuality uniform scales of pay should be introduced everywhere.
('70', 393, 1, 11, 814120) If, while doing so, a particular mill is put to a strain, the other mill should get together and compensate it.
('70', 393, 1, 12, 814232) Similarly, whenever it is found that workers have to suffer, those among them who stand to gain should compensate the loss to those who would be adversely affected.
('70', 393, 1, 13, 814397) I am also of the opinion that the practice of having different scales of wages for labourers working in different departments should be abolished and uniform wages should be accepted for all labourers.
('70', 393, 1, 14, 814599) I know that this may seem to be an impossibele task, but a further consideration will show that the need for this will become obvious if the united strength of labourers is to be made invincible.
('70', 393, 1, 15, 814795) Why should anyone working the power loom for sixty hours get Rs. 30, while a person looking after the spindle for the same number of hours gets Rs. 13?
('70', 393, 1, 16, 814947) It whould not be proper to conclude that the former has to work more than the latter.
('70', 393, 1, 17, 815033) If is not also fitting for one labourer to say that he has to use more intelligence than another.
('70', 393, 1, 18, 815131) So long as such discrepancies exist, jealousies are bound to be there and, as long as there is jealousy, there can be no true unity.
('70', 393, 1, 19, 815264) This problem, at root, is of some educational value to labourers and to
('70', 394, 0, 1, 815336) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 BEBRUARY, 1937 395
('70', 394, 1, 2, 815385) society as a whole.
('70', 394, 1, 3, 815405) In my view, the key to socialism lies in equal pay for equal work.
('70', 394, 1, 4, 815472) Everyone’s basic needs are more or less the same.
('70', 394, 1, 5, 815522) The larger part of the world will always consist of labourers, hence the only way for their uplift is to accept the principle of equal wages.
('70', 394, 1, 6, 815664) There is no other way but to do so.
('70', 394, 1, 7, 815700) It is likely that all this may appear to be the talk of someone who lives in a dream world.
('70', 394, 1, 8, 815792) But unless workers make such dreams come true, their real authority, which is only a dream today, will always remain so.
('70', 394, 1, 9, 815913) Yes, there is one exception.
('70', 394, 1, 10, 815942) If workers wish to establish their authority with the use of arms, that is, through force, it may appear to be possible.
('70', 394, 1, 11, 816063) This article is based on the assumption that the workers of Ahmedabad have given up violence on principle.
('70', 394, 1, 12, 816170) But, for the moment, let us, assume that the working class is even prepared to use force.
('70', 394, 1, 13, 816260) My contention is that there is every likelihood of a struggle taking place amongst them as soon as they get power.
('70', 394, 1, 14, 816375) Be that as it may, because I am a worshipper of non violence alone, I can wield my pen only to uphold non violent means.
('70', 394, 1, 15, 816496) My mind cannot even conceive of the triumph of any other means.
('70', 394, 1, 16, 816560) Hence, I shall have betrayed the workers if I do not put before them for their consideration what has been uppermost in my mind while reflecting upon their plight during the past three or four months.
('70', 394, 1, 17, 816761) If workers cannot digest these important changes all at once, let them move step by step.
('70', 394, 1, 18, 816851) But they must set it as their aim that there should be the same scale of wages for all workers.
('70', 394, 1, 19, 816947) This much is sufficient for today.

('70', 395, 7, 17, 818315) On the other days I dictate letters, as writing with the left hand is rather time consuming.
('70', 395, 7, 18, 818408) Parameshwari has drafted and sent a proposal which is in accordance with the opinion I have come to form regarding his future.
('70', 395, 7, 19, 818535) If you have no objection please sign it and send it to me.
('70', 395, 7, 20, 818594) No one knows what it will come to in the end.

('70', 396, 3, 9, 819641) Why should you become so discouraged in only two or three days?
('70', 396, 3, 10, 819705) Your letter smacks of lack of faith.
('70', 396, 3, 11, 819742) You have a few boils, you do not even give yourself full treatment and you become frightened that they will never go.
('70', 396, 3, 12, 819860) What is this?
('70', 396, 3, 13, 819874) You must have the conviction that you are going to get well, and that quickly, and that in order to get well you will scrupulously obey the doctor’s or the vaidya’s advice in so far as you have no conscientious objection to it.
('70', 396, 3, 14, 820102) You should not become a prey to gloomy thoughts.
('70', 396, 3, 15, 820151) Why should you worry about carrying out my decision?

('70', 396, 9, 29, 820723) What I expect you to do is to pull your weight in the right direction.

('70', 397, 5, 8, 821336) February 8, 1937
('70', 397, 6, 9, 821353) MY DEAR BHARATAN,
('70', 397, 7, 10, 821371) I have just read your note 2. It is good so far as it goes.
('70', 397, 7, 11, 821431) It is going in just as it is.
('70', 397, 7, 12, 821461) Read my article 3 in the current issue and offer your comments if any or write more.
('70', 397, 7, 13, 821546) Love to you both.

('70', 397, 10, 16, 821621) SEGAON, February 9, 1937
('70', 397, 11, 17, 821646) LILA, I got your letter.
('70', 397, 11, 18, 821671) It was good to hear that your brother’s health was improving fast.
('70', 397, 11, 19, 821738) When he is permitted to leave Bombay, I would prefer Matheran to Rajkot if he is quite fit then to go out for walks.
('70', 397, 11, 20, 821855) The water at Matheran contains iron and is, therefore, supposed to be heavy.
('70', 397, 11, 21, 821932) But it is very good for those who can take walks.
('70', 397, 11, 22, 821982) The climate of course is good.
('70', 397, 11, 23, 822013) But Matheran is not a good place if one has to remain in bed.
('70', 397, 11, 24, 822075) From the point of view of expenses, there is no doubt that Rajkot is cheaper than Matheran.
('70', 397, 11, 25, 822167) As regards eating, there is only one way for you: you should ponder over the eleven vows every morning and evening.
('70', 397, 11, 26, 822283) That means
('70', 397, 12, 27, 822294) 1 The addressee was Dewan of Cochin and had written to Gandhiji that there was no persecution in Cochin.

('70', 398, 1, 2, 822644) you tell God, with the world as your witness, that you ceaselessly strive to keep them.
('70', 398, 1, 3, 822732) These vows include the vow of non indulgence of the palate.
('70', 398, 1, 4, 822792) You and I, therefore, and all others who regularly ponder on that vow cannot eat a single morsel for gratifying the palate.
('70', 398, 1, 5, 822916) We can eat merely to sustain the body and keep it alive.
('70', 398, 1, 6, 822973) The sole reason for the exclusion of condiments from our food is the vow of non indulgence of the palate.
('70', 398, 1, 7, 823079) One can eat even chillies as medicine.
('70', 398, 1, 8, 823118) But one cannot take even salt for the pleasure of the palate.
('70', 398, 1, 9, 823180) If you keep pondering over the meaning of these vows and live accordingly, you will earn the merit of living here no matter where you are staying.
('70', 398, 1, 10, 823327) On the contrary, even if you live here and go on repeating the vows in words but do not strive constantly to keep them, you will only be deceiving yourself by living here.
('70', 398, 1, 11, 823499) It will not, therefore, be proper if, having gone there for service, you become negligent in keeping the vows.

('70', 398, 5, 15, 823740) February 9, 1937
('70', 398, 6, 16, 823757) BHAI NATHUBHAI,
('70', 398, 7, 17, 823773) I got both your letters.
('70', 398, 7, 18, 823798) I am replying 1 to the first question in Harijanbandhu.
('70', 398, 7, 19, 823854) Please see it.
('70', 398, 7, 20, 823869) Very few persons would be interested in the other questions, and so I am replying to them here.
('70', 398, 7, 21, 823965) The vegetarians may keep meat eating animals, but they should not procure meat for them, e.g., the cat and the dog.
('70', 398, 7, 22, 824081) Both are carnivorous, but we do not procure meat for them.
('70', 398, 7, 23, 824140) I know the Jain belief.
('70', 398, 7, 24, 824164) I knew the ideas of Raichandbhai, but I am convinced that they are not consistent with the ethics of ahimsa.
('70', 398, 7, 25, 824273) From the point of view of ahimsa, uncooked things should be considered sufficient for the needs of the body.
('70', 398, 7, 26, 824382) Drying, pickling and cooking are forms of violent possessiveness and should, therefore, be eschewed.
('70', 398, 7, 27, 824483) I see no meaning in the distinction that is made between tubers and other vegetables.
('70', 398, 7, 28, 824569) In Jain literature ahimsa has been

('70', 399, 1, 2, 824691) confined only to a discussion of what should be eaten and what should not be eaten.
('70', 399, 1, 3, 824775) This, in my view, is a travesty of ahimsa.
('70', 399, 1, 4, 824818) I have seen non vegetarians who are the very images of compassion and hence I consider them to be votaries of ahimsa in spite of their being non vegetarians.
('70', 399, 1, 5, 824976) I have also seen people who, although avoiding green vegetables, etc., gratify their palate in all sorts of ways and are full of cruelty.
('70', 399, 1, 6, 825114) I believe that they are a disgrace to dharma.
('70', 399, 1, 7, 825160) I also believe that had Raichandbhai not died prematurely, he would have fully endorsed what I am saying here now.
('70', 399, 1, 8, 825275) To say that a fast is broken by cleaning the teeth or by taking a bath is, in my opinion, sheer ignorance.
('70', 399, 1, 9, 825382) Those who are completely free from passions and are living in uninhabited forests, wearing no clothes and eating only fruit, etc., yielded by the trees, who meditate on God and roam about, for them it might not matter if they did not clean the teeth or take bath because leaves of neem trees are both their food and their means of cleaning the teeth.
('70', 399, 1, 10, 825733) Earth and sun rays are their bath.
('70', 399, 1, 11, 825768) It would be sheer ignorance to apply this, during a fast, to persons who are full of evil emotions, hold all kinds of possessions and whose every pore emits foul smell.
('70', 399, 1, 12, 825937) As in curds, there are countless bacteria in milk also, a far greater number of them than in plants, tubers, etc.
('70', 399, 1, 13, 826051) To distinguish among vegetables as some that may be eaten and others that must be avoided, and at the same time to take milk, etc., freely, is like stealing an anvil and giving a needle in alms.

('70', 399, 6, 18, 826378) I have your letter.

('70', 399, 6, 20, 826424) I have not cons ulted anyone so far but my feeling is that you can be accommodated in the high school here.
('70', 399, 6, 21, 826532) You can be useful for teaching Hindi, English or Mathematics.
('70', 399, 6, 22, 826594) Or you can be given some other work, such as would justify Rs. 75 a month being paid to you.
('70', 399, 6, 23, 826687) It is also possible that I may not be able to fix you at Wardha.
('70', 399, 6, 24, 826752) Then I can find some other place.
('70', 399, 6, 25, 826786) But I can make enquiries only when I know that you are ready.
('70', 399, 6, 26, 826848) But please understand that Rs. 75 is the beginning and the end of it.

('70', 400, 1, 3, 827023) Your asking for more would lead to your degradation.
('70', 400, 1, 4, 827076) Think well and tell me if I should start working in this direction?

('70', 400, 1, 7, 827293) Only then shall I try to do something.

('70', 400, 6, 13, 827498) MY DEAR KRAUSE,
('70', 400, 7, 14, 827514) I am ashamed of myself.
('70', 400, 7, 15, 827538) It will be difficult to forgive myself if you have to leave without our meeting.

('70', 400, 7, 18, 827785) You can go to Calcutta via Wardha.
('70', 400, 7, 19, 827820) It is the most direct route from Bombay.
('70', 400, 7, 20, 827861) You can also go from Calcutta to Madras via Wardha though that does become a little indirect.
('70', 400, 7, 21, 827955) You can also go from Calcutta to Delhi via Wardha.
('70', 400, 7, 22, 828006) If you find you simply cannot do it I shall not blame you.
('70', 400, 7, 23, 828065) It will be my stupidity that will be to blame.
('70', 400, 7, 24, 828112) I am glad to receive all the messages that you have brought for me.
('70', 400, 7, 25, 828180) They revive old memories.

('70', 400, 7, 27, 828290) I expect you will be going to Delhi.
('70', 400, 7, 28, 828327) If you do, you should ask your guides to take you to the Harijan Colony, Kingsway, Delhi.
('70', 400, 7, 29, 828417) You will meet my youngest son there.
('70', 400, 7, 30, 828454) But what I want you to see is the work going on in the colony amongst the so called untouchables.

('70', 401, 6, 10, 829206) 418. AHMEDABAD MILL INDUSTRY
('70', 401, 7, 11, 829235) Now that the Ahmedabad Mill Industry has tided over the difficulty that had arisen over the mill owners’ demand for a cut in the wages of labour, it is well to examine the conditions of its stability.
('70', 401, 7, 12, 829436) The Umpire, Sir Govindrao Madgavkar, deserves the thanks of both the parties for his great labour of love.
('70', 401, 7, 13, 829543) The public do not know that he undertook the onerous burden without any fees which he might have insisted upon, if he had so chosen.
('70', 401, 7, 14, 829676) Having entered upon the task he might have lightened it by merely giving his decision without any argument.
('70', 401, 7, 15, 829784) Instead he has reasoned out his Award and made valuable suggestions for the guidance of both capital and labour.
('70', 401, 7, 16, 829897) It is to be hoped that both parties will whole heartedly act up to the Umpire’s suggestion and work out the Delhi agreement.
('70', 401, 7, 17, 830022) The Umpire has made it perfectly clear that no cut is possible without fully implementing the Delhi agreement which has also the merit of being turned into an award of the then Umpire, Mr. Patkar, retired High Court Judge.
('70', 401, 7, 18, 830245) The essential conditions of that agreement are that wages must be standardized for the whole mill industry and that there should
('70', 402, 0, 1, 830374) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 BEBRUARY, 1937 403
('70', 402, 1, 2, 830423) be a scheme for automatic adjustment whenever there is a demand for a cut or a rise in the wages.
('70', 402, 1, 3, 830521) It has been argued on behalf of the mill owners that neither standardization not automatic adjustment is a practical proposition.
('70', 402, 1, 4, 830651) The Umpire has rejected that argument.
('70', 402, 1, 5, 830690) Indeed he could not do otherwise.
('70', 402, 1, 6, 830724) Surely the parties knew what they were doing when they entered into the agreement at Delhi.
('70', 402, 1, 7, 830816) They would never have introduced the two clauses if they had thought them to be unworkable.
('70', 402, 1, 8, 830908) It may be that the parties may not agree to a common scheme.
('70', 402, 1, 9, 830969) It is for them to refer their differences then to the arbitrators and, the latter failing, to an Umpire.
('70', 402, 1, 10, 831074) Standardization of wages is a mechanical or arithmetical proposition.
('70', 402, 1, 11, 831144) It may be that an intermediate stage is necessary before all the mills can be induced to adopt an even scale of wages or labour can in all cases be induced to accept a level which in some cases must mean a large reduction in wages though the whole total remains unaffected.
('70', 402, 1, 12, 831418) But a scheme of automatic adjustment of wages is undoubtedly a complicated matter.
('70', 402, 1, 13, 831501) It demands for its fruition a spirit of give and take on both sides.
('70', 402, 1, 14, 831570) And any such scheme must, in the nature of things, be of a temporary character subject to periodical revision.
('70', 402, 1, 15, 831681) No scheme of automatic adjustment is possible without reference to the maxims I have ventured to mention in my Award and which Sir Govindrao has been pleased to dismiss as idealistic.
('70', 402, 1, 16, 831865) Of course it was no part of his duty as Umpire to examine or refer to them at all.
('70', 402, 1, 17, 831948) I have myself stated in my Award that the maxims have not guided my decision.
('70', 402, 1, 18, 832026) But having referred to them at all, the learned Umpire might have shown how or why they were idealistic.
('70', 402, 1, 19, 832131) I propose to show that whether they are idealistic or otherwise it is impossible to arrive at a satisfactory scheme of automatic adjustment without reference to them.
('70', 402, 1, 20, 832298) They must be the measuring rod for action which may and will probably fall short of it.
('70', 402, 1, 21, 832386) Let me reproduce below a translation 1 of the original which is in Gujarati: Now take the first maxim.
('70', 402, 1, 22, 832489) Why should mills desire a cut so long as they have profits?
('70', 402, 1, 23, 832549) It would be like a man desiring to cut off his feet to ease some derangement of the belly, Do they cut out machinery in order to ensure a certain percentage of profits?
('70', 402, 1, 24, 832718) Are men and women who may be called living machines less than inert machinery?
('70', 402, 1, 25, 832797) Is there anything very idealistic in the suggestion that the wages of the
('70', 402, 2, 26, 832871) 1 Not reproduced here.
('70', 402, 2, 27, 832894) For the text, vide clauses XVI and XVII of Award in Labout Dispute, 26 12 1936
('70', 403, 0, 1, 832973) THE COLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 404
('70', 403, 1, 2, 833014) operatives, who are at least as much a foundation of the industry as the machinery and buildings, may not be reduced to ensure a minimum of profits?
('70', 403, 1, 3, 833163) I make bold to say that if the votes of humane shareholders (and I regard the shareholders of mills as humane) were taken, they would summarily reject the proposition that their profits should be preferred to the wages of labour on whom depend their profits.
('70', 403, 1, 4, 833422) And if the first maxim must at least be seriously considered, the second about the living wage follows from it.
('70', 403, 1, 5, 833534) If there can be no cut before profits are on the brink of sinking, it is necessary to know the limit beyond which reduction in wages cannot go.
('70', 403, 1, 6, 833678) In other words, there must be a decision as to what constitutes a living wage.
('70', 403, 1, 7, 833757) I am not concerned with the name.
('70', 403, 1, 8, 833791) Call it the minimum wage, if that expression sounds sweeter.
('70', 403, 1, 9, 833852) The process is the same.
('70', 403, 1, 10, 833877) Living wage to my mind is the most accurate description for an irreducible wage.
('70', 403, 1, 11, 833958) And the acceptance of the principle of a living wage implies an examination of what may be included in it.
('70', 403, 1, 12, 834065) Should intoxicants form part, should tobacco be included, may milk or ghee or gur be excluded?
('70', 403, 1, 13, 834160) These are no visionary things.
('70', 403, 1, 14, 834191) They touch the very existence of labour.
('70', 403, 1, 15, 834232) Its efficiency depends very largely upon the right kind of living.
('70', 403, 1, 16, 834299) And the greater the efficiency, the greater the possibility of enhanced profits.
('70', 403, 1, 17, 834380) Maxim (d) is self evident and accepted by the arbitrators as well as the Umpire.
('70', 403, 1, 18, 834461) Who can deny the reasonableness of the statement (Maxim c) that workmen should be regarded as equal owners with the shareholders?
('70', 403, 1, 19, 834591) If conflict between capital and labour is to be avoided, as I believe it can and must be, labour should have the same status and dignity as capital.
('70', 403, 1, 20, 834740) Why should a million rupees put together be more than a million men or women put together?
('70', 403, 1, 21, 834831) Are they not infinitely more than metal, white or yellow?
('70', 403, 1, 22, 834889) Or should holders of metal always assume that labour cannot be organized and put together as metal can?
('70', 403, 1, 23, 834993) For the past eighteen years, consciously or unconsciously, capital and labour have acted in Ahmedabad on the assumption that there is no inherent conflict between the two.
('70', 403, 1, 24, 835165) It is true that peace between the two has been precarious.
('70', 403, 1, 25, 835224) But it has been so because the parties have not recognized the full validity of the maxims as the conditions of an abiding peace.
('70', 403, 1, 26, 835354) If then labourers are co equal owners, their organization should have the same access to the transactions of mills as the shareholders.
('70', 404, 0, 1, 835490) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 BEBRUARY, 1937 405
('70', 404, 1, 2, 835539) Indeed there can be no confidence on the part of labour if material information is withheld from it.
('70', 404, 1, 3, 835640) The last maxim admits of no weakening.
('70', 404, 1, 4, 835679) If the Labour Union is regarded as a desirable organization as much as is the mill owners’, and is not merely tolerated as a necessary evil, it follows that there should be an agreed register of available hands and that the mill owners should not accept or engage any person outside the Labour Union.
('70', 404, 1, 5, 835980) Thus it seems to me that the maxims are not visionary, but on examination they are found to be absolutely essential to the healthy existence or growth of the great industry in whose interest they have been humbly suggested.
('70', 404, 1, 6, 836204) It need not be stated that the list submitted is by no means exhaustive.
('70', 404, 1, 7, 836277) I must suggest some more, when I am able to revert to the question.

('70', 404, 6, 11, 836428) Your letter dated 16 1 37 reached my hands only three days ago.
('70', 404, 6, 12, 836492) You are of course aware that I had been touring in Travancore.
('70', 404, 6, 13, 836555) What should I write now?
('70', 404, 6, 14, 836580) I have already written to Dr. Roy.
('70', 404, 6, 15, 836615) He will of course admit you.
('70', 404, 6, 16, 836644) Why do you insist on a letter written in my own hand?
('70', 404, 6, 17, 836698) These days my right hand needs rest.
('70', 404, 6, 18, 836735) Writing with the left hand takes time.

('70', 405, 2, 3, 836956) The following 1 was received just after I had finished the Travancore pilgrimage: The letter is from a retired principal of a college and deserves attention.
('70', 405, 2, 4, 837114) I have already drawn attention to the many implications of the Proclamation.
('70', 405, 2, 5, 837191) But I have not touched in that connection the question of inter dining.
('70', 405, 2, 6, 837263) My views in the matter are well known.
('70', 405, 2, 7, 837302) Restrictions on inter dining have no vital connection with varnadh arma.
('70', 405, 2, 8, 837375) They were, in my opinion, hygienic rules in origin.
('70', 405, 2, 9, 837427) Given a proper conformity with the rules of cleanliness there should be no scruple about dining with anybody.
('70', 405, 2, 10, 837537) And training Harijan boys and girls as members of a family ensures cleanliness and raises their status and removes in the safest manner the insane caste restrictions on inter dining.
('70', 405, 2, 11, 837720) I fully agree with the writer of the letter quoted that equality all along the line is implied in the Proclamation.
('70', 405, 2, 12, 837836) The young Maharaja has given the lead.
('70', 405, 2, 13, 837875) Will the people of Travancore follow it in all its implications?

('70', 405, 4, 15, 837959) 421. WHAT KHADI WORKERS SHOULD KNOW 2
('70', 405, 5, 16, 837997) In previous article I have tried to explain what should be covered by the science of khadi.
('70', 405, 5, 17, 838089) In my opinion it should be made obligatory on every khadi worker engaged in any of the production centres of the A.I.S.A. to know the elements of this science.
('70', 405, 5, 18, 838249) Lakshmidas is a khadi lover and one of the most careful students of the science of khadi that we have.
('70', 405, 5, 19, 838352) But I would not call even him a master of the science.
('70', 405, 5, 20, 838407) In the course of a letter which he addressed me in November 1935, he laid down what he considered to be the minimum test which every khadi worker ought to satisfy.
('70', 405, 5, 21, 838571) The test is reproduced below:
('70', 405, 6, 22, 838601) (1) The worker should know how to distinguish between superior and inferior grades of cotton, cotton seed and lint.
('70', 405, 7, 23, 838717) 1 Not reproduced here.
('70', 405, 7, 24, 838740) The correspondent had suggested that to make the Proclamation a real success people should introduce inter dining and also employ poor Harijans as cooks and domestic servants.
('70', 405, 7, 25, 838916) 2 Translated by Pyarelal from the original in Gujarati
('70', 406, 0, 1, 838971) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 BEBRUARY, 1937 407
('70', 406, 1, 2, 839020) (2) He should be able to fix in position the rolling pin of a hand ginning machine and to make the necessary correction and adjustment to make it exactly fit with the fixed roller, when the former happens to be bent or of unequal thickness.
('70', 406, 1, 3, 839261) (3) He should be able to fit up a carding bow and to prepare the gut and the hide piece for the shoulder blade.
('70', 406, 1, 4, 839373) (4) He should be able to show a ginning speed of five pounds an hour on a hand ginning machine over a period of four hours.
('70', 406, 1, 5, 839497) (5) He must show a carding speed of ten tolas of cotton wool per hour, excluding the time required for making slivers.
('70', 406, 1, 6, 839616) (6) He must know the construction of every type of spinning wheel and how to assemble it.
('70', 406, 1, 7, 839706) He must be able to straighten a spindle gone out of shape and to prepare the mal and the daman the cross bands of the motor wheel.
('70', 406, 1, 8, 839837) (7) He must be able to maintain a spinning speed of 300 rounds (400 yards) of yarn of 20 s, with a tensile strength of over 80% and evenness 95% in a four hours’ test.
('70', 406, 1, 9, 840005) (8) He should know the Andhra process of spinning and must be able to spin 200 rounds of 70 s to 80 s , strength 80% and evenness 95% during a two hours’ test.
('70', 406, 1, 10, 840165) (9) He should know the construction of a pit loom as well as a fly shuttle loom and be able to prepare together the reeds, the healds and the sizing brush.
('70', 406, 1, 11, 840321) (10) He should be able to weave khadi of 50” width on a fly shuttle loom from yarn of 20 s and to make all necessary adjustments to produce at least five different kinds of border designs for saris.
('70', 406, 1, 12, 840520) (11) The speed of weaving should come up to one square yard in an hour from yarn of 20 s .
('70', 406, 1, 13, 840611) (12) He should know all about the growing of different varieties of cotton and should be able to get hand gins, carding bows, spinning wheels, looms and their accessories locally prepared, preferably out of local material.
('70', 406, 1, 14, 840834) This would involve a knowledge of: (a) Rainfall, its extent and distribution over different parts of the year, and a knowledge of manures and the nature of the soil.
('70', 406, 1, 15, 841000) (b) Different kinds of wood and of calculations relating to measurement.
('70', 406, 1, 16, 841073) (c) A workable knowledge of drawing for the above mentioned needs.
('70', 406, 1, 17, 841140) (13) A knowledge of carpentry sufficient for repairing the various machines.
('70', 406, 1, 18, 841217) It is not quite easy to fulfil this test.
('70', 406, 1, 19, 841259) But given sufficient earnestness and a measure of diligence, anyone who has had a fair education in this should be able to satisfy Sjt.
('70', 406, 1, 20, 841395) Lakshmidas’s test.
('70', 406, 1, 21, 841414) That would, however, still leave uncovered the commercial aspect of the science of khadi.
('70', 406, 1, 22, 841504) That is covered by the questions drawn up by me.
('70', 406, 1, 23, 841553) The syllabus prepared by Sjt.
('70', 406, 1, 24, 841583) Lakshmidas is calculated to cover the technical side.
('70', 406, 1, 25, 841637) One must be an adept in both these fields before he can
('70', 407, 0, 1, 841693) THE COLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 408
('70', 407, 1, 2, 841734) be said to be versed in the elements of the science of khadi.
('70', 407, 1, 3, 841796) I shall feel thankful if such khadi workers as may happen to read this article, and can satisfy the technical or the commercial test or both, will send me their full names and addresses.
('70', 407, 1, 4, 841983) Similarly those who are eager to qualify themselves in the elementary science of khadi should also communicate with me.
('70', 407, 1, 5, 842103) Unluckily today we have no suitable text books that could be used to impart the required knowledge.
('70', 407, 1, 6, 842203) The only available book that somewhat answers the purpose is that of late Sjt.
('70', 407, 1, 7, 842282) Maganlal Gandhi.
('70', 407, 1, 8, 842299) But even that book is now out of date owing to the advance that the science of khadi has made since that book was written.
('70', 407, 1, 9, 842422) A revised edition of that book is therefore urgently needed.
('70', 407, 1, 10, 842483) That can come about only if we have lovers of khadi who would devote themselves to the revision and have the leisure for the work.

('70', 407, 4, 17, 842823) But I think I ought to reply.
('70', 407, 4, 18, 842853) Since you yourself have become a devi 1, need I suffix ‘devi’ to your name?

('70', 408, 1, 2, 843562) 424. MY NOTES
('70', 408, 2, 3, 843576) THE PROBLEM IN REVERSE
('70', 408, 3, 4, 843599) A Hindu gentleman having read my reply 1 to a Muslim gentleman’s letter in the Harijanbandhu of 31 1 1937 writes to say.
('70', 408, 4, 5, 843720) I feel that the reply to this question is contained in what I had written previously.
('70', 408, 4, 6, 843806) In that case, the Muslim gentleman had introduced a new custom and consequently had to put up with the orthodoxy of his relations.
('70', 408, 4, 7, 843937) In this case, people wish to give up their existing tradition and eat meat.
('70', 408, 4, 8, 844013) A vegetarian Hindu is by no means bound to encourage them.
('70', 408, 4, 9, 844072) It depends on each individual as to how far he is prepared to abandon existing tradition in such matters.
('70', 408, 4, 10, 844178) Those who regard giving up meat as a part of religion are likely to find it intolerable if other members of the family eat meat.
('70', 408, 4, 11, 844307) We should follow ahimsa dharma or the religion of love in all our conduct.
('70', 408, 4, 12, 844382) There should be no anger towards those who give up their religion, they should be won over through love alone.
('70', 408, 4, 13, 844493) How this may be done, is to be considered in each particular case.
('70', 408, 5, 14, 844560) WRONG THINKING
('70', 408, 6, 15, 844575) A co worker committed an error in a fit of rage.
('70', 408, 6, 16, 844624) I explained to him that it was a grave error and that he should atone for it by apologizing to the person he had wronged.
('70', 408, 6, 17, 844746) He admitted his fault and also the need for apologizing but he told me that he was not worthy of what I had asked him to do, that he had not risen so high and was not capable of doing so at one stroke.
('70', 408, 6, 18, 844948) After that, this co worker, saw his mistake.
('70', 408, 6, 19, 844993) He is a mature and balanced person.
('70', 408, 6, 20, 845029) The object of writing this is merely to show that like this co worker many of us are given to erroneous thinking.
('70', 408, 6, 21, 845143) To apologize for an offence which has already been committed is even less than paying back a debt without any interest.
('70', 408, 6, 22, 845263) It can be compared to a promise to repay a debt, as an offence already committed is not wiped out by an apology; but it does imply a promise not to commit such an offence in the future.
('70', 408, 6, 23, 845449) No debtor to this day has argued that he is not fit to repay his debts.
('70', 408, 7, 24, 845521) 1 Vide “Need for Tolerance”, 13 3 1937 2 The letter has not been translated here.
('70', 408, 7, 25, 845603) The correspondent had stated that Gandhiji’s reply to the Muslim gentleman might be in conformity with Islam but it was not in conformity with Hinduism.
('70', 408, 7, 26, 845756) He had asked whether it was proper for a vegetarian to buy meat for his family members.
('70', 409, 0, 1, 845844) THE COLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 410
('70', 409, 1, 2, 845885) may happen that at that moment he does not have a sufficient sum to repay his debts.
('70', 409, 1, 3, 845970) However, it would provoke laughter if a debtor argued that he was unworthy of repaying his debts.
('70', 409, 1, 4, 846068) This may even be regarded as impudence.
('70', 409, 1, 5, 846108) But in moral matters, very often people deceive themselves.
('70', 409, 1, 6, 846168) Impatience and subtle pride lie at the root of this.
('70', 409, 1, 7, 846221) If this were not the case, how could we fail to see something which is as clear as daylight?
('70', 409, 1, 8, 846314) We do not have the capacity to do many things.
('70', 409, 1, 9, 846361) And there is no room for any effort if, because of this want of ability, we regard ourselves as unfit for that task.
('70', 409, 1, 10, 846478) Hence no one should consider himself unworthy of doing any good work.
('70', 409, 1, 11, 846548) No one should doubt that repeated efforts are certain to make us capable of doing it.

('70', 409, 3, 14, 846707) SEGAON, WARDHA, February 14, 1937
('70', 409, 4, 15, 846741) CHHAGANLAL,
('70', 409, 5, 16, 846753) I got your letter.
('70', 409, 5, 17, 846772) Whatever Valji may do, you cannot come out of Saurashtra in the manner suggested by you.
('70', 409, 5, 18, 846861) I can understand your resorting to satyagraha just to oppose the Foreigners’ Act, after giving the Government a sufficiently long notice, though I wouldn’t approve even of that.
('70', 409, 5, 19, 847039) I do not think you will have to wait long now.
('70', 409, 5, 20, 847086) After the new constitution starts functioning, the Government will probably find it difficult to keep such notices in force.
('70', 409, 5, 21, 847211) Meanwhile, you should write to the persons named by you and ask them what their aim is in disobeying the law.
('70', 409, 5, 22, 847321) If I could write to them, I should be glad to do so, for that might lead to an opportunity for a pure fight and the Foreigners’ Act might even go.
('70', 409, 5, 23, 847468) But it is outside my present sphere of work to collect material for such a fight.
('70', 409, 5, 24, 847550) However, if you have learnt anything from me, you can form an intelligent and firm plan on these few words of mine.
('70', 409, 5, 25, 847666) Nineteen persons can do a lot.
('70', 409, 5, 26, 847697) The views which you have expressed are a sign of cowardice.
('70', 409, 5, 27, 847757) It does not befit a satyagrahi to think of quietly disobeying a law out of desperation and submitting to imprisonment or other consequences which might follow.
('70', 409, 5, 28, 847917) The line, “Bathe and wash yourself and dress
('70', 410, 0, 1, 847962) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 BEBRUARY, 1937 411
('70', 410, 1, 2, 848011) your hair, for the time has come to go to live with the beloved one”, holds true of all satyagrahis.
('70', 410, 1, 3, 848112) When a satyagrahi goes to battle, he does so after full preparation and with beating of drums, for he goes to jail as he would go to live in a palace.
('70', 410, 1, 4, 848263) To be merely ready to suffer the punishment if caught is not the right attitude for a satyagrahi to adopt.
('70', 410, 1, 5, 848370) Even thieves and dacoits do that.
('70', 410, 1, 6, 848404) Everyone who follows the way of violence risks his life when he embarks on his venture.
('70', 410, 1, 7, 848492) Is not being confined to Kathiawar a form of imprisonment?
('70', 410, 1, 8, 848551) If you are weary of such imprisonment, how would you bear banishment to the Andamans?
('70', 410, 1, 9, 848637) But I will not dwell further on this subject.
('70', 410, 1, 10, 848683) If I were to go on writing about it, I have so much to say that I would fill pages.
('70', 410, 1, 11, 848767) Your letter has opened not a small window but a big door in my brain, from which can pour out a flood of thoughts.
('70', 410, 1, 12, 848882) But, however unwillingly, I must shut that door.
('70', 410, 1, 13, 848931) I am giving rest to my right hand these days, and so dictate the letters.
('70', 410, 1, 14, 849005) On Mondays I cannot do without using the right hand.
('70', 410, 1, 15, 849058) I can write with the left, but at present I cannot spare the time that this would require.

('70', 410, 7, 21, 849278) There is no reason for you to be overwrought.
('70', 410, 7, 22, 849324) It is good you have placed yourself under the doctor’s care.
('70', 410, 7, 23, 849385) You are bound to be cured.
('70', 410, 7, 24, 849412) Only do not give up patience.
('70', 410, 7, 25, 849442) Doctors, vaidyas and hakims all make mistakes.
('70', 410, 7, 26, 849489) The system precluding any posibility of mistake is nature cure.
('70', 410, 7, 27, 849553) But very few people have the faith to carry it on and there are very few experienced practitioners.

('70', 411, 3, 4, 849831) MANILAL AND SUSHILA,
('70', 411, 4, 5, 849852) I feel ashamed that I am not able to write to you.
('70', 411, 4, 6, 849903) I do remember that I have to write but can’t because of the pressure of work.
('70', 411, 4, 7, 849981) I will be more careful hereafter, even if it is only two lines that I can write, as is the case today.
('70', 411, 4, 8, 850084) But please be content since there are long letters from Ba and Manu.
('70', 411, 4, 9, 850153) Krause has arrived.
('70', 411, 4, 10, 850173) Probably he will be going back without seeing me because of two day’s delay on my part.
('70', 411, 4, 11, 850261) He got my letter late.
('70', 411, 4, 12, 850284) I have a long letter from him.
('70', 411, 4, 13, 850315) I have suggested that he should see Devdas.

('70', 411, 8, 17, 850469) BALWANTSINHA,
('70', 411, 9, 18, 850483) How angry you can get!
('70', 411, 9, 19, 850506) Such rage and such rudeness at a remark from an ignorant and idle boy 1!
('70', 411, 9, 20, 850579) You have broken all the vows!
('70', 411, 9, 21, 850609) What do you know of my conversation with Prabhu Dayal?
('70', 411, 9, 22, 850664) Shall I laugh or weep over your letter or be angry in return?
('70', 411, 9, 23, 850726) Your letter is one to be wept over but I shall not weep.
('70', 411, 9, 24, 850783) To give way to anger would be a sin and a bad example.
('70', 411, 9, 25, 850838) I shall therefore laugh over this folly of yours.
('70', 411, 9, 26, 850888) If you are tired you may certainly leave Segaon.
('70', 411, 9, 27, 850937) But you should first come over with Prabhu Dayal and let me explain what happened.
('70', 411, 9, 28, 851020) You may then do what you like.
('70', 411, 9, 29, 851051) You need not come today.
('70', 411, 9, 30, 851076) Come when you are all right.
('70', 411, 9, 31, 851105) Consider as taboo the food prepared by Prabhu Dayal.

('70', 412, 2, 4, 851561) February 16, 1937
('70', 412, 3, 5, 851579) DEAR DR.
('70', 412, 3, 6, 851588) GOPICHAND,
('70', 412, 4, 7, 851599) Surely there is nothing intrinsically wrong in seeking election to Legislative Councils or Assemblies.
('70', 412, 4, 8, 851702) Therefore, if there were any sin in your having done so it could only be if you felt that it was wrong to do so.
('70', 412, 4, 9, 851815) Not because I had said so but because you had come to that conclusion independently.
('70', 412, 4, 10, 851900) No prayaschitta 1 is necessary beyond this obvious thing that in terms of the constitution you should retire from the A.I.V.I.A. That retirement will be severely felt at least by me.
('70', 412, 4, 11, 852083) But your not doing so will be still more terrible.
('70', 412, 4, 12, 852134) You will still do whatever you can for the Association, guiding whoever may be the agent of the Association.
('70', 412, 4, 13, 852243) I know that this will not be the same thing as your being an active member but it will be the next best thing to do.
('70', 412, 4, 14, 852360) You cannot be both a parliamentarian and an active worker in the cause of village uplift.
('70', 412, 4, 15, 852450) A good parliamentarian’s work is cut out for him—he too can make himself busy all day long if he is conscientious and wants to become an efficient parliamentarian.
('70', 412, 4, 16, 852614) Of course our personal relations will remain unaffected no matter what happens.
('70', 412, 4, 17, 852694) In my opinion you have undoubtedly erred but you have erred in what you considered was a good cause.
('70', 412, 4, 18, 852795) And the cause was good, only not for you because of your previous, definite and unequivocal commitment.
('70', 412, 5, 19, 852899) Yours sincerely, BAPU DR.

('70', 412, 9, 26, 853095) You cannot be more sorry than I am about the resignation.
('70', 412, 9, 27, 853153) I like him immensely.
('70', 412, 9, 28, 853175) He is one of the most selfless men I have known and he is a most conscientious worker— absolutely reliable.
('70', 412, 9, 29, 853283) He would never handle a thing which he cannot

('70', 413, 1, 2, 853382) But he and Kumarappa cannot hit it off.
('70', 413, 1, 3, 853422) They are temperam entally different and their method of work is different and Kumarappa finds it very hard to get on with him.
('70', 413, 1, 4, 853549) Kumarappa too has the qualities that Jajuji possesses.
('70', 413, 1, 5, 853604) We cannot do without either.
('70', 413, 1, 6, 853633) Jajuji still remains a member of the Board.
('70', 413, 1, 7, 853677) I thought, therefore, that the best way of dealing with the difficult situation that has arisen was to accept Jajuji’s resignation but, of course, it is for the Board to decide.
('70', 413, 1, 8, 853855) If there is any other way of dealing with the difficulty that way should be adopted.
('70', 413, 1, 9, 853940) When the meeting takes place we shall consider all the ways and means.
('70', 413, 1, 10, 854011) I will send you as much gur as I can when I know of someone going to Bombay.
('70', 413, 1, 11, 854088) You don’t want to incur railway charges.
('70', 413, 1, 12, 854129) I shall probably get Duncan to take it to you.
('70', 413, 1, 13, 854176) He is a new member of the family and I am sure you will like him when you meet him.
('70', 413, 1, 14, 854260) He has come all the way from England to see me.
('70', 413, 1, 15, 854308) Chhotelal tells me you took away one Karad chakki some time ago.
('70', 413, 1, 16, 854373) If that is so, you don’t want another.
('70', 413, 1, 17, 854412) If you do, let me know.

('70', 413, 4, 24, 854697) LILA, I got your letter.
('70', 413, 4, 25, 854722) After you have become used to writing with a reed pen you wouldn’t like the steel nib.
('70', 413, 4, 26, 854809) The latter became popular merely because of people’s laziness, for it does not need to be mended whereas the reed pen frequently does.
('70', 413, 4, 27, 854944) Besides, the steel nib probably seems cheaper, though a reed pen must prove cheaper if used carefully.
('70', 413, 4, 28, 855047) Moreover, mending a reed pen is an art by itself; and a steel nib can never write as beautifully as a reed pen.
('70', 413, 4, 29, 855159) It is difficult to write Indian scripts with the steel nib, which is made for the Western scripts.
('70', 413, 4, 30, 855258) Of course I do not mean to say that steel nibs that can write the Indian scripts cannot be made.
('70', 413, 4, 31, 855355) So much for the steelnib philosophy!

('70', 414, 7, 12, 855946) I got your letter.

('70', 414, 7, 14, 856021) Would you like to add anything?
('70', 414, 7, 15, 856053) Revise the summary and send it back.
('70', 414, 7, 16, 856090) I am enclosing another letter also.
('70', 414, 7, 17, 856126) The writer’s full name is Nanubhai Desai.
('70', 414, 7, 18, 856168) He had given his address in his previous letter.
('70', 414, 7, 19, 856217) He has forgotten to give it in this.
('70', 414, 7, 20, 856254) Nanavati knows him.
('70', 414, 7, 21, 856274) He has given the address of Ramanlal Engineer who stays near Ellis Bridge.
('70', 414, 7, 22, 856349) Puratan would probably know him since he is working among the Harijans.
('70', 414, 7, 23, 856421) Ask him.
('70', 414, 7, 24, 856430) My purpose in sending his letter to you is this: I have advised him to get married.
('70', 414, 7, 25, 856514) He says he is ready to marry even a Harijan girl.
('70', 414, 7, 26, 856564) Perhaps he may be a suitable match for Dudhabhai’s Mani.
('70', 414, 7, 27, 856621) Please inquire about it.
('70', 414, 7, 28, 856646) That is, call him to you and have a talk with him.
('70', 414, 7, 29, 856697) Ask him about his family.
('70', 414, 7, 30, 856723) And if you find everything all right, do what may be necessary.
('70', 414, 7, 31, 856787) Write to Nanubhai and tell him that because he didn’t give his address in his second letter I couldn’t write to him direct.
('70', 414, 7, 32, 856911) I was going to advise him to go to you in any case.

('70', 415, 3, 4, 857219) SURENDRA,
('70', 415, 4, 5, 857229) When I said ‘yatra’ I meant a pilgrimage.
('70', 415, 4, 6, 857271) Otherwise I would have used the word ‘musafari’ 1. We are trying to include in the morning prayer, not the whole Upanishad, but certainly the first verse.
('70', 415, 4, 7, 857426) Tena tyaktena 2 is more pregnant with meaning.
('70', 415, 4, 8, 857473) “Left over from yajna” 3 can be derived from it.
('70', 415, 4, 9, 857522) Tena tyaktena can bear two meanings: one, that which is given by God, and two, that one must renounce everything.
('70', 415, 4, 10, 857636) But when one has renounced everything, what is left over?
('70', 415, 4, 11, 857694) However, life must go on and so we have “bhunjitha” 4. That is to say that one must partake, like a medicine, of what God has given.
('70', 415, 4, 12, 857827) And this applies not only to the food that we must eat but to all the needs of body, mind and soul that we must satisfy.

('70', 415, 9, 19, 858133) Perhaps you do not know that my understanding of modern poetry is very limited.
('70', 415, 9, 20, 858213) So I cannot easily understand the kind of poems you write.
('70', 415, 9, 21, 858272) That you went over it again and meticulously rectified the mistakes shows your love for me.
('70', 415, 9, 22, 858364) But on whom do you shower such love?
('70', 415, 9, 23, 858401) Of what value is music to a deaf man?
('70', 415, 9, 24, 858439) I will try to read the poem once again with the help of your notes and try to understand it.
('70', 415, 9, 25, 858532) The other thing is certainly my subject.
('70', 415, 9, 26, 858573) The verses quoted by Shri Wadia are not appropriate.
('70', 415, 9, 27, 858626) What he wants is impossible.
('70', 415, 9, 28, 858655) You did not see this.
('70', 415, 9, 29, 858677) And the only meaning which can be deduced from what you quote is that truth should not be told in a pleasant manner.
('70', 415, 9, 30, 858794) It may not be a violation of truth to call the father the husband of the mother.
('70', 415, 9, 31, 858875) But it is certainly a violation of social usage.

('70', 416, 6, 10, 859421) I had never thought you capable of such fury.
('70', 416, 6, 11, 859467) I sent a message through Jhaverbhai.
('70', 416, 6, 12, 859504) You will have acted upon it.
('70', 416, 6, 13, 859533) Chanchalbehn will be cooking for you; you will accept it with humility.
('70', 416, 6, 14, 859605) Do what the doctor says and get well soon.
('70', 416, 6, 15, 859648) You may do what you like after you are well.

('70', 416, 12, 26, 860134) You did not even follow what I told you.
('70', 416, 12, 27, 860175) When you advanced the excuse that you could not give full time to paper making because you had to serve Balvantsinha, you made a grievous blunder.
('70', 416, 12, 28, 860322) You only added fuel to the fire of his anger.
('70', 416, 12, 29, 860368) Were you not told that even after giving six hours to your work you could do anything else you wanted to, even cook for Balvantsinha?
('70', 416, 12, 30, 860502) Now I am left with no alternative but to give you railway fare and tell you to go home.
('70', 416, 12, 31, 860590) You are not fit to do honest labour.
('70', 416, 12, 32, 860627) You cannot distinguish between truth and untruth, Do not harass me further by insisting on living in Wardha.
('70', 416, 12, 33, 860736) Go away tomorrow if
('70', 417, 0, 1, 860756) THE COLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 418
('70', 417, 1, 2, 860797) possible.
('70', 417, 1, 3, 860807) I have explained everything to Kanu.
('70', 417, 1, 4, 860844) He will pay you the money.
('70', 417, 1, 5, 860871) There is no need to see me.
('70', 417, 1, 6, 860899) You may write to me if you wish after going home.
('70', 417, 1, 7, 860949) You will not be able to achieve anything till you start being earnest in doing physical labour, till you begin to learn to speak less, stop speaking and writing without cause and learn to tell the truth.
('70', 417, 1, 8, 861153) Hence it will be very good if after going home you do these three things well.

('70', 417, 5, 12, 861330) SEGAON, February 17, 1937
('70', 417, 6, 13, 861356) BHAI DILKHUSH,
('70', 417, 7, 14, 861371) I am happy to have your letter.
('70', 417, 7, 15, 861403) You should certainly make an effort.
('70', 417, 7, 16, 861440) Better still, write a small book.
('70', 417, 7, 17, 861474) If you want you can consult me.
('70', 417, 7, 18, 861506) I will certainly give you guidance.
('70', 417, 7, 19, 861542) You may make some alterations in my questions.
('70', 417, 7, 20, 861589) I put down the questions as they occurred to me.
('70', 417, 7, 21, 861638) So there is scope for amplifying them and arranging them more systematically.
('70', 417, 7, 22, 861716) Maybe you will like to leave out carpentry and weaving sections for the time being.
('70', 417, 7, 23, 861800) Proceed as follows: history of cotton, varieties of cotton, how to recognize them, when and how to collect them, shelling of the pods, uses of the shells, ginning wheel, description of its parts, methods of ginning.
('70', 417, 7, 24, 862016) Similarly about carding, sliver making and spinning.
('70', 417, 7, 25, 862069) If you follow this order the work will be easy.
('70', 417, 7, 26, 862117) If you have written anything as a specimen, send it to me.
('70', 417, 7, 27, 862176) I will go through it.
('70', 417, 7, 28, 862198) I will make suggestions if they are called for.
('70', 417, 7, 29, 862246) Do not write anything unless you can do so from personal experience.
('70', 417, 7, 30, 862315) I have seen some books written without personal experience and I have found that they are not at all useful.
('70', 417, 7, 31, 862424) So make use of whatever you read only after testing it in practice.
('70', 417, 7, 32, 862492) This however applies only to the actual working.
('70', 417, 7, 33, 862541) There are certain things which we cannot learn by experience.
('70', 417, 7, 34, 862603) In such cases our duty is to find out how reliable the writer is.
('70', 417, 7, 35, 862669) It is good there are so few writers on the subject, so there is not much choice.

('70', 418, 3, 4, 862901) BHAI SOHANLAL,
('70', 418, 4, 5, 862916) Telling lies is not less of a sin than lechery.
('70', 418, 4, 6, 862964) But one who is a libertine in secret is guilty of three sins: he falls himself, he brings about another’s fall, and he also lies.

('70', 418, 9, 11, 863225) DEAR SISTER,
('70', 418, 10, 12, 863238) My son sent me your letter to him in which you have asked for my autograph for the purpose of selling it in aid of the stricken women and children of Spain.
('70', 418, 10, 13, 863395) While that unhappy people has my whole hearted sympathy I am not sending you my autograph.
('70', 418, 10, 14, 863486) I am not convinced of the right of employing such means for obtaining money for a good cause.
('70', 418, 10, 15, 863580) People should subscribe willingly for such without expecting any return.
('70', 418, 11, 16, 863653) My affection to you both.

('70', 418, 15, 20, 863794) February 18, 1937
('70', 418, 16, 21, 863812) I am an idealist.
('70', 418, 16, 22, 863830) I am also a practical man.
('70', 418, 16, 23, 863857) I have no enmity toward foreign countries but I cannot harm my country for their sake.
('70', 418, 16, 24, 863944) I first began using Indian dates in South Africa and kept up the practice on my return to India.
('70', 418, 16, 25, 864041) But I found that the preference was
('70', 418, 17, 26, 864077) 1 A khadi worker of the Punjab
('70', 419, 0, 1, 864108) THE COLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 420
('70', 419, 1, 2, 864149) meaningless.
('70', 419, 1, 3, 864162) And what a number of calendars we have!
('70', 419, 1, 4, 864202) One in Bengal, three in Maharashtra, your own yet another, one in Bihar, one observed by the Arya Samaj, Hijrj for the Mussalmans.
('70', 419, 1, 5, 864333) I should have so many panchangs 1 with me; only then can I possibly be impartial towards the people of other provinces.
('70', 419, 1, 6, 864453) Alongside I have to take note of the western calendar.
('70', 419, 1, 7, 864508) Under the circumstances I gave up the use of the Indian calendar and it has resulted in no harm to anyone; in fact I have only benefited.
('70', 419, 1, 8, 864646) I have no resentment towards protagonists like you of the solar calendar though not to be resentful is indeed difficult.
('70', 419, 1, 9, 864767) If I resent your partiality I should return your letter and supplememt the date Magh 24 with the Christian year.
('70', 419, 1, 10, 864880) Love holds me back from such impertinence.
('70', 419, 1, 11, 864923) The Gregorian calendar is not solely English, it is used far and wide in the West.
('70', 419, 1, 12, 865006) We do adopt many things Western, many of them are harmful while some are beneficial.
('70', 419, 1, 13, 865091) As for the Gregorian calendar, if it is not of benefit, it is not harmful either.
('70', 419, 1, 14, 865173) Now for the second question.
('70', 419, 1, 15, 865202) You believe in Ekantvad while I believe in Anekantvad.
('70', 419, 1, 16, 865257) If I am granted Dominion Status along with the right to secede from the Empire whenever I choose to do so, then the heart of an Ekantvadi like yourself will certainly undergo a change.
('70', 419, 1, 17, 865442) But the day when we shall be thus blessed is in the distant future.
('70', 419, 1, 18, 865510) For the present we are only the sufferers.
('70', 419, 1, 19, 865553) But take it that as soon as India gets Dominion Status the word Ramarajya will go.
('70', 419, 1, 20, 865636) When the authority comes to be vested in Indians the occasion will spark off internecine strife.
('70', 419, 1, 21, 865733) You will want the capital in Kashi while I shall favour Segaon.
('70', 419, 1, 22, 865797) But the day is far too distant, why need we quarrel about it now?
('70', 419, 1, 23, 865863) Disregard my views and improve your health with the help of asanas and concentration upon Ramanama.
('70', 419, 1, 24, 865963) Rest assured that the sacrifices made by Indians will not go in vain because of my shortcomings; neither will your imprisonment prove fruitless.

('70', 420, 6, 15, 867080) DEAR GURUDEV,
('70', 420, 7, 16, 867094) I got your letter of the 10th instant five days ago.
('70', 420, 7, 17, 867147) Your trust in me and affection for me are there to be seen in every line but what about my amazing limitations?
('70', 420, 7, 18, 867259) My shoulders are too weak to bear the burden you wish to impose upon me.
('70', 420, 7, 19, 867332) My regard to you pulls me in one direction, my reason in the opposite, and it would be folly on my part to surrender reason to emotion in a question like the one that faces me.
('70', 420, 7, 20, 867509) I know that if I undertake the trust I would not need to go into details of administration but it does imply capacity for financing the Institution 2 and what I heard two days ago has deepened my reluctance for I understand that in spite of your promise 3 to me in Delhi you are about to go to Ahmedabad on a begging expedition.
('70', 420, 7, 21, 867838) I was grieved and I would ask you on bended knees to forgo the expedition if it is really decided upon.
('70', 420, 7, 22, 867942) And in any case I would beg of you to recall my appointment as one of the Trustees.

('70', 421, 2, 3, 868451) MAHADEV, You surely know that I did not refuse merely out of courtesy.
('70', 421, 2, 4, 868522) Hence it is altogether wrong for you to take the blame on yourself.
('70', 421, 2, 5, 868590) It was but proper for you at that time not to press me.
('70', 421, 2, 6, 868646) I enjoyed myself thoroughly that night.
('70', 421, 2, 7, 868686) I did not get nervous when I discovered that I had lost the way.
('70', 421, 2, 8, 868751) I realized the error in just five minutes.
('70', 421, 2, 9, 868794) There was a sudden change in the landscape and so I stopped the car and got down.
('70', 421, 2, 10, 868876) I looked around me on all sides and enjoyed the pleasure of solitude that chance had given me.
('70', 421, 2, 11, 868971) Looking round, I observed the changed position of the stars and retraced my way.
('70', 421, 2, 12, 869052) I hardly took ten minutes to find the point where I had taken the wrong turn.

('70', 421, 5, 16, 869307) You should be satisfied with what God gives you.
('70', 421, 5, 17, 869356) Do not forsake what he has given you.
('70', 421, 5, 18, 869394) Do not envy others what they have or do not have.
('70', 421, 5, 19, 869444) That is the meaning of the last line.
('70', 421, 5, 20, 869482) Wealth does not mean money and riches.
('70', 421, 5, 21, 869521) One man’s wealth is scholarship, another’s is physical health while that of a third is sacrifice.
('70', 421, 5, 22, 869619) Do not feel envious of all these things.
('70', 421, 5, 23, 869660) That is to say, you should not feel disturbed by others’ intelligence, efficiency, sacrifice etc.
('70', 421, 5, 24, 869758) You should never think about it.
('70', 421, 5, 25, 869791) We should sacrifice what we can without any difficulty and feel happy about it.
('70', 421, 5, 26, 869871) But you are doing just the opposite.
('70', 421, 5, 27, 869908) You are angry because others are not doing anything.
('70', 421, 5, 28, 869961) You go on asking yourself—why isn’t the Travancore Maharaja a great saint?
('70', 421, 5, 29, 870036) Why isn’t an immoral person pure?
('70', 421, 5, 30, 870070) Why do the zamindars not become sensible?
('70', 421, 5, 31, 870112) Why do the poor not occupy palaces?
('70', 421, 5, 32, 870148) To think in this manner is contrary to the mantra.
('70', 421, 5, 33, 870199) The popular meaning of the mantra is: Let the world do what it wants.
('70', 421, 5, 34, 870269) Watch it.
('70', 421, 5, 35, 870279) Whatever you do, do it in the name of God and only as much as He allows you to in the name of God and only as much as He allows you to do.
('70', 421, 5, 36, 870418) Take as much as He allows you to take and be happy.

('70', 422, 7, 9, 870794) 446. SO CALLED INCONSISTENCIES
('70', 422, 8, 10, 870825) I have some very persistent correspondents who put posers before me.
('70', 422, 8, 11, 870894) Here is a specimen letter from one such correspondent:
('70', 422, 9, 12, 870949) Whenever economic troubles arise and whenever questions have been put to you on the economic relations of capital and labour, you have put forth the theory of trusteeship which has always puzzled me.
('70', 422, 9, 13, 871149) You want the rich to hold all their property in trust for the poor and expend it for their benefit.
('70', 422, 9, 14, 871249) If I ask you whether this is possible, you will tell me that my question arises from a belief in the essential selfishness of human nature and that your theory is based on the essential goodness of human nature.
('70', 422, 9, 15, 871461) However, in the political sphere, you do not hold such views without at the same time losing your faith in the fundamental goodness of human nature.
('70', 422, 9, 16, 871610) The British claim the same trusteeship for their domination of India.
('70', 422, 9, 17, 871680) But you have lost faith in the British Empire long ago, and today there is no greater enemy to it than you.
('70', 422, 9, 18, 871788) Is it consistent to have one law for the political world and another for the economic world?
('70', 422, 9, 19, 871881) Or, do you mean to say that you have not lost faith in capitalism and capitalists just as you have lost faith in British Imperialism and the British?
('70', 422, 9, 20, 872031) For your trusteeship theory sounds very much like the Divine Right theory of kings which has been exploded long ago.
('70', 422, 9, 21, 872148) When one man, who was allowed to hold political power in trust for all the others and who derived it from them, misused it, people revolted against it and democracy was born.
('70', 422, 9, 22, 872323) Similarly now, when a few, who ought to hold the economic power in trust for the others from whom they derive it, use it for their own self aggrandisement and to the detriment of the rest, the inevitable result is the deprivation of the few of the means of economic power by the many, i.e., the birth of socialism.
('70', 423, 0, 1, 872638) THE COLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 424
('70', 423, 1, 2, 872679) Hitherto violence was the only recognized means to attain anything good or bad.
('70', 423, 1, 3, 872759) When violence is employed even with a view to achieve good, it brings evil in its train and compromises the good achieved.
('70', 423, 1, 4, 872882) Now I take it that your definite contribution to the world lies in your having successfully demonstrated the efficacy of another means, namely, non violence, which is superior to violence and does not poison human relations.
('70', 423, 1, 5, 873107) Therefore my fondest hope is that you should fight and end the present economic order non violently and help to create a new one.
('70', 423, 2, 6, 873237) Secondly, you may answer another question agitating my mind.
('70', 423, 2, 7, 873298) In 1930 when you launched your Satyagraha campaign, you declared that the fight was a fight to the finish and you would either return victorious or your dead body would float on the waters of the sea.
('70', 423, 2, 8, 873499) Even in your subsequent statements you emphasized this and called upon all Indians to fight determinedly.
('70', 423, 2, 9, 873605) Now, though you have reserved the right to civil disobedience to yourself, you have abandoned the fight against the Government.
('70', 423, 2, 10, 873733) At the present moment you are devoting yourself heart and soul to the infusing of life into and raising the standard of the Indian village.
('70', 423, 2, 11, 873873) I do not know whether you consider this phase of your activity as fight against the Government.
('70', 423, 2, 12, 873969) The A.I.V.I.A. is divorced from all politics, and therefore your activity in the promotion of the objects of the A.I.V.I.A. cannot be called a part of the political fight to win political freedom for our country.
('70', 423, 2, 13, 874182) Or do you think there can be gaps, intervening periods of lull in a fight called a fight to the finish?
('70', 423, 2, 14, 874286) If so, why did you differentiate the fight of 1930 from that of 1920 and call the former a fight to the finish?
('70', 423, 3, 15, 874398) To take the first part, I see no inconsistency in my treatment of capitalism or imperialism.
('70', 423, 3, 16, 874491) My correspondent has been led into a confusion of thought.
('70', 423, 3, 17, 874550) I have not talked or thought of what kings, imperialists or capitalists claim and have claimed.
('70', 423, 3, 18, 874646) I have talked and written of how capital may be treated.
('70', 423, 3, 19, 874703) And then it is one thing to make a claim and another to live up to it.
('70', 423, 3, 20, 874774) Not everyone like me (say) who claims to be a servant of the people becomes that by the mere assertion.
('70', 423, 3, 21, 874878) And yet all would appreciate persons like me if we were found to be living up to our claim.
('70', 423, 3, 22, 874970) Similarly would all rejoice if a capitalist were to divest himself of exclusive ownership and declare himself to be in possession as a trustee for the people.
('70', 423, 3, 23, 875129) It is highly probable that my advice will not be accepted and my dream will not be realized.
('70', 423, 3, 24, 875222) But who can guarantee that the socialists’ dream will be realized?
('70', 423, 3, 25, 875289) Socialism was not born with the discovery of the misuse of capital by capitalists.
('70', 423, 3, 26, 875372) As I have contended, socialism, even
('70', 424, 0, 1, 875409) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 BEBRUARY, 1937 425
('70', 424, 1, 2, 875458) communism, is explicit in the first verse of Ishopanishad.
('70', 424, 1, 3, 875517) What is true is that when some reformers lost faith in the method of conversion, the technique of what is known as scientific socialism was born.
('70', 424, 1, 4, 875663) I am engaged in solving the same problem that faces scientific socialists.
('70', 424, 1, 5, 875738) It is true, however, that my approach is always and only through unadulterated non violence.
('70', 424, 1, 6, 875831) It may fail.
('70', 424, 1, 7, 875844) If it does, it will be because of my ignorance of the technique of non violence.
('70', 424, 1, 8, 875925) I may be a bad exponent of the doctrine in which my faith is daily increasing.
('70', 424, 1, 9, 876004) The A.I.S.A. and the A.I.V.I.A. are organizations through which the technique of non violence is being tested on an all India scale.
('70', 424, 1, 10, 876137) They are special autonomous bodies created by the Congress for the purpose of enabling me to conduct my experiments without being fattered by the vicissitudes of policy to which a wholly democratic body like the Congress is always liable.
('70', 424, 1, 11, 876376) Trusteeship, as I conceive it, has yet to prove its worth.
('70', 424, 1, 12, 876435) It is an attempt to secure the best use of property for the people by competent hands.
('70', 424, 1, 13, 876522) Now for the second part of the letter.
('70', 424, 1, 14, 876561) I do not divide life into water tight compartments.
('70', 424, 1, 15, 876613) The life of a nation like that of individuals is an indivisible whole.
('70', 424, 1, 16, 876684) My retirement from the Congress or political life so called does not mean the slightest diminution in my yearning for India’s complete independence; nor is civil disobedience any distinct process of non violence.
('70', 424, 1, 17, 876897) It is one of the many non violent processes which are in no way inconsistent with one another.
('70', 424, 1, 18, 876992) What I have to do is to give a clear demonstration of non violence in all my actions.
('70', 424, 1, 19, 877078) I claim to be conducting my experiment in a scientific spirit.
('70', 424, 1, 20, 877141) In the garden of non violence are many plants.
('70', 424, 1, 21, 877188) They are all from the same parent.
('70', 424, 1, 22, 877223) They may not be all used simultaneously.
('70', 424, 1, 23, 877264) Some are less powerful than others.
('70', 424, 1, 24, 877300) All are harmless.
('70', 424, 1, 25, 877318) But they have to be handled skilfully.
('70', 424, 1, 26, 877357) I am applying such skill to their use as God has given me.
('70', 424, 1, 27, 877416) But because I use one plant rather than another at any time, it does not follow that I give up the fight.
('70', 424, 1, 28, 877522) It is a fight to the finish.
('70', 424, 1, 29, 877551) Defeat has no place in the dictionary of non violence.

('70', 425, 2, 3, 877685) An advocate from Tamil Nad writes: 1
('70', 425, 3, 4, 877722) I write this letter to you since we want you to advise us on a problem which vitally affects us and which is in all respects like the Harijan problem— the problem of pollution.
('70', 425, 4, 5, 877899) The Bar Association of this place is nearly 100 strong.
('70', 425, 4, 6, 877955) All members of the Association are Brahmins except fot three, of whom one is a Christian.
('70', 425, 4, 7, 878045) The members pay a monthly subscription and the Association is maintained from the subscriptions.
('70', 425, 4, 8, 878142) The Association maintains a water pot for drinking purposes which is kept in a room.
('70', 425, 4, 9, 878227) On account of this there was an uproar in the Association and the Brahmin members objected to our taking water from the pot kept in the room on the sentimental ground of pollution .
('70', 425, 5, 10, 878409) I am writing this to you so that you can give us the lead and valuable advice for us to follow, lest we should err.
('70', 425, 5, 11, 878525) This is an old letter.
('70', 425, 5, 12, 878548) Probably the Bar Association referred to by my correspondent has settled the differences in an honourable manner.
('70', 425, 5, 13, 878662) But I know the evil persists in many places.
('70', 425, 5, 14, 878707) What is true of bar associations is equally true of schools and colleges.
('70', 425, 5, 15, 878781) I have no manner of doubt that the setting up of such a bar in public schools and associations is a usurpation wholly indefensible, and I should be surprised if it is not also illegal.
('70', 425, 5, 16, 878966) Those who have prejudices such as the correspondent describes may make their own individual arrangements but cannot deprive fellow members and fellow students of the right of using common property in a manner common to all.

('70', 425, 8, 19, 879227) A young man who is trying to live in a village and earn his livelihood has sent me a pathetic letter.
('70', 425, 8, 20, 879329) He does not know much English.
('70', 425, 8, 21, 879360) I am therefore giving the letter below in an abridged form:
('70', 425, 9, 22, 879420) Three years ago when I was 20 years old I came to this village after spending 15 years in a town.
('70', 425, 9, 23, 879518) My domestic circumstances did not allow me to have college education.
('70', 425, 9, 24, 879588) The work you have taken up for village revival has
('70', 425, 10, 25, 879639) 1 Only extracts are reproduced here.
('70', 426, 0, 1, 879676) VOL. 70 : 21 OCTOBER, 1936 24 BEBRUARY, 1937 427
('70', 426, 1, 2, 879725) encouraged me to pursue village life.
('70', 426, 1, 3, 879763) I have some land.
('70', 426, 1, 4, 879781) My village has a population of nearly 2,500. After close contact with this village I find the following among more than three fourths of the people:
('70', 426, 2, 5, 879930) (1) Party feelings and quarrels,
('70', 426, 3, 6, 879963) (2) Jealousy,
('70', 426, 4, 7, 879977) (3) Illiteracy,
('70', 426, 5, 8, 879993) (4) Wickedness,
('70', 426, 6, 9, 880009) (5) Disunion,
('70', 426, 7, 10, 880023) (6) Carelessness,
('70', 426, 8, 11, 880041) (7) Lack of manners,
('70', 426, 9, 12, 880062) (8) Adherence to the old meaningless customs,
('70', 426, 10, 13, 880108) (9) Cruelty.
('70', 426, 11, 14, 880121) This is an out of the way place.
('70', 426, 11, 15, 880154) No great man has ever visited such remote villages.
('70', 426, 11, 16, 880206) The company of great ones is essential for advancement.
('70', 426, 11, 17, 880262) So I am afraid to live in this village.
('70', 426, 11, 18, 880302) Shall I leave this village?
('70', 426, 11, 19, 880330) If not, what guidance will you give me?
('70', 426, 12, 20, 880370) Though no doubt there is exaggeration in the picture drawn by the young correspondent, his statement may be generally accepted.
('70', 426, 12, 21, 880498) The reason for the tragic state is not far to seek.
('70', 426, 12, 22, 880550) Villages have suffered long from neglect by those who have had the benefit of education.
('70', 426, 12, 23, 880639) They have chosen the city life.
('70', 426, 12, 24, 880671) The village movement is an attempt to establish healthy contact with the villages by inducing those who are fired with the spirit of service to settle in them and find self expression in the service of villagers.
('70', 426, 12, 25, 880884) The defects noticed by the correspondent are not inherent in village life.
('70', 426, 12, 26, 880959) Those who have settled in villages in the spirit of service are not dismayed by the difficulties facing them.They knew before they went that they would have to contend against many difficulties including even sullenness on the part of villagers.
('70', 426, 12, 27, 881205) Only those, therefore, who have faith in themselves and in their mission will serve the villagers and influence their lives.
('70', 426, 12, 28, 881330) A true life lived amongst the people is in itself an object lesson that must produce its own effect upon immediate surroundings.
('70', 426, 12, 29, 881459) The difficulty with the young man is, perhaps, that he has gone to the village merely to earn a living without the spirit of service behind it.
('70', 426, 12, 30, 881603) I admit that village life does not offer attractions to those who go there in search of money.
('70', 426, 12, 31, 881698) Without the incentive of service village life would jar after the novelty has worn out.
('70', 426, 12, 32, 881786) No young man having gone to a village may abandon the pursuit on the slightest contact with difficulty.
('70', 427, 0, 1, 881890) THE COLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 428
('70', 427, 1, 2, 881931) Patient effort will show that villagers are not very different from city dwellers and that they will respond to kindliness and attention.
('70', 427, 1, 3, 882069) It is no doubt true that one does not have in the villages the opportunity of contact with the great ones of the land.
('70', 427, 1, 4, 882188) With the growth of village mentality the leaders will find it necessary to tour in the villages and establish a living touch with them.
('70', 427, 1, 5, 882324) Moreover, the companionship of the great and the good is available to all through the works of saints like Chaitanya, Ramakrishna, Tulsidas, Kabir, Nanak, Dadu, Tukaram, Tiruvalluvar, and others too numerous to mention though equally known and pious.
('70', 427, 1, 6, 882575) The difficulty is to get the mind tuned to the reception of permanent values.
('70', 427, 1, 7, 882653) If it is modern thought—political, social, economical, scientific—that is meant, it is possible to procure literature that will satisfy curiosity.
('70', 427, 1, 8, 882800) I admit, however, that one does not find such as easily as one finds religious literature.
('70', 427, 1, 9, 882891) Saints wrote and spoke for the masses.
('70', 427, 1, 10, 882930) The vogue for translating modern thought to the masses in an acceptable manner has not yer quite set in.
('70', 427, 1, 11, 883035) But it must come in time.
('70', 427, 1, 12, 883061) I would, therefore, advise young men like my correspondent not to give in but persist in their effort and by their presence make the villages more livable and lovable.
('70', 427, 1, 13, 883229) That they will do by serving the villages in a manner acceptable to the villagers.
('70', 427, 1, 14, 883312) Everyone can make the beginning by making the villages cleaner by their own labour and removing illiteracy to the extent of their ability.
('70', 427, 1, 15, 883451) And if their lives are clean, methodical and industrious, there is no doubt that the infection will spread in the villages in which they may be working.

('70', 427, 5, 19, 883680) It is not impossible to say when the reformers irritate people and when they dispel their misapprehension.
('70', 427, 5, 20, 883787) By a single act or word alone it is possible to cause irritation as well as to dispel misapprehension.
('70', 427, 5, 21, 883890) It should be left to each individual to make his own decision regarding this.
('70', 427, 5, 22, 883968) This much can be said with certainty, that we should do nothing
('70', 427, 6, 23, 884032) 1 This appeared under “Notes”.
('70', 427, 6, 24, 884063) 2 The letter is not translated here.
('70', 427, 6, 25, 884100) The correspondent had said that while reformers readily accepted food and drink from Harijans in public they did not do so in their homes for fear that doing so might irritate people.

('70', 428, 1, 2, 884333) with a view to irritating anyone; and at the same time we must certainly endeavour to dispel any misapprehension.
('70', 428, 1, 3, 884447) When the work of reform has become a second nature with one, the question of wanting to irritate anyone does not arise.
('70', 428, 1, 4, 884567) For who can give up his own nature?
('70', 428, 1, 5, 884603) And when action or word becomes natural no one will feel irritated by it.
('70', 428, 1, 6, 884677) Therefore, the proper thing would be for the reformer to pursue his duty as duty, and not with any other motive.
('70', 428, 1, 7, 884790) By doing so, misappreh ension will be dispelled automatically.

('70', 428, 4, 10, 884917) A correspondent writes: 1
('70', 428, 5, 11, 884943) It certainly is necessary.
('70', 428, 5, 12, 884970) If in all Harijan schools the caste Hindu boys are admitted in large numbers there is certainly a danger of Harijan boys being deprived of education.
('70', 428, 5, 13, 885120) Therefore some fees must be collected from every caste Hindu boy.
('70', 428, 5, 14, 885186) It is possible that caste Hindu boys are also poor like Harijan boys.
('70', 428, 5, 15, 885256) If that is the case, then the Bihar Harijan Sevak Sangh should hold consultations with the Bihar Vidyapith and ask the Vidyapith to bear the expense of all the caste Hindu boys attending the schools.
('70', 428, 5, 16, 885456) The Vidyapith’s field is unrestricted whereas the Harijan Sevak Sangh’s is restricted and it should be so.
('70', 428, 5, 17, 885563) Therefore it would be wrong for the Harijan Sevak Sangh to impart free education to caste Hindu boys, while in the case of the Vidyapith it may be a duty.

('70', 428, 7, 20, 885793) The correspondent had complained that in Bihar a certain Harijan school had more non Harijan boys than Harijan boys because the school charged no fee.
('70', 428, 7, 21, 885944) The policy of the Harijan Sevak Sangh, he had pointed out, was to charge fees from non Harijan boys and had asked if it was necessary further to clarify the point.

('70', 429, 3, 5, 886359) I see that you are labouring under a sense of injustice and irritation.
('70', 429, 3, 6, 886431) Let me give you my assurance that no one has the slightest intention of giving you any cause for offence.
('70', 429, 3, 7, 886537) Jajuji and Kumarappa have appreciated your co operation and the benefit you have given the A.I.V.I.A. of your expert knowledge and guidance.
('70', 429, 3, 8, 886678) Of course I know that you undertook to come and organize the paper department at my instance and request.
('70', 429, 3, 9, 886784) I know your worth and I do not want to lose your services so patriotically given.
('70', 429, 3, 10, 886866) I know, too, that in our country we have very few experts.
('70', 429, 3, 11, 886925) Of these those who will give their free service for the benefit of the villagers can be counted on one’s finger tips and you are one of them.
('70', 429, 3, 12, 887067) It will not do for you, therefore, to be offended.
('70', 429, 3, 13, 887118) Do please, therefore come as soon as you can spare the time and I will personally see to it that every cause of offence is removed.
('70', 429, 3, 14, 887250) With your assistance I want the paper department to be put in a first class condition.

('70', 430, 7, 10, 888118) I could have written more had I detained Kumarappa’s car which did not seem proper and writing with the left hand is an extremely slow business.
('70', 430, 7, 11, 888263) Impatience will only delay the cure, it is possible only through patience.
('70', 430, 7, 12, 888338) The civil surgeon says that impurity in your blood is not recent but of a long standing, which makes treatment prolonged.
('70', 430, 7, 13, 888460) What are you doing there?
('70', 430, 7, 14, 888486) How do you pass your time and what is the diet?
('70', 430, 7, 15, 888534) A cheerful spirit is a great contributing factor towards recovery.
('70', 430, 7, 16, 888601) A student of the Gita should be content whatever be his lot.
('70', 430, 7, 17, 888662) This is said in Chapter XII.

('70', 431, 1, 2, 888959) 455. MY NOTES
('70', 431, 2, 3, 888973) INNOCENT HUMOUR Last year, Shri Kishorelal Mashruwala had gone on a tour of Bihar on behalf of the Gandhi Seva Sangh.
('70', 431, 2, 4, 889091) He had also visited the Santhal Paragana.
('70', 431, 2, 5, 889133) Generally the people there are very poor.
('70', 431, 2, 6, 889175) It can be said that they are largely untouched by modern civilization.
('70', 431, 2, 7, 889246) During his tour of the Paragana Kishorelal happened to go to a village.
('70', 431, 2, 8, 889318) The headman of the village, although illiterate, knew his work well.
('70', 431, 2, 9, 889387) Shri Kishorelal writes about him as follows:
('70', 431, 3, 10, 889432) Though he is illiterate, he told me his tale in a very touching manner.
('70', 431, 3, 11, 889504) It did not appear that he was repeating someone else’s words.
('70', 431, 3, 12, 889566) I found in this headman the naive humour which is characteristic of villagers.
('70', 431, 3, 13, 889645) He said: “We have only one difficulty: when there is famine in our parts, the crops die, the cattle die, human beings die, well water dies but revenue and interest—these two never die.
('70', 431, 3, 14, 889830) This is our only sorrow.” Man cannot survive without humour.
('70', 431, 3, 15, 889891) Moreover, people in the villages do not have the means to kill time which city dwellers have.
('70', 431, 3, 16, 889985) I do not believe that these are necessary.
('70', 431, 3, 17, 890028) Wherever things are well planned, there is no need to kill time.
('70', 431, 3, 18, 890093) Man hardly has time enough to spare.
('70', 431, 3, 19, 890130) He has sufficient time just to carry out his duties.
('70', 431, 3, 20, 890183) Instead, we waste a great deal of time and, as a result, suffer starvation.
('70', 431, 3, 21, 890259) Human beings do not get worn out through work.
('70', 431, 3, 22, 890306) It is by working that man remains fresh and makes progress in every direction.
('70', 431, 3, 23, 890385) He gets worn out through worry, by doing that which should not be done and by wasting time.
('70', 431, 3, 24, 890477) That headman was capable of laughing despite bitter experiences because he would not have been idle in his own work.
('70', 431, 3, 25, 890594) His humour may be taken as a sign of the joy he could feel in the midst of difficulties.
('70', 431, 3, 26, 890683) SELF SUFFICIENCY IN CLOTH In the very same letter, Shri Kishorelal writes as follows about other Santhals: 1
('70', 431, 4, 27, 890792) What has been made possible with these simple Santhals should be possible at any place if the effort is made.
('70', 431, 4, 28, 890902) Despite this, self sufficiency in cloth has made little progress in our society.
('70', 431, 4, 29, 890983) It is the
('70', 431, 5, 30, 890993) 1 The letter is not translated here.
('70', 431, 5, 31, 891030) Mashruwala had stated that the Manjhi Santhals of Hazaribagh district were the only industrious people he found in Bihar.
('70', 431, 5, 32, 891152) They were truly self sufficient in the matter of clothing.

('70', 432, 1, 2, 891260) task of the khadi worker to find out its causes.
('70', 432, 1, 3, 891309) How could self sufficiency be attained in the above mentioned village?
('70', 432, 1, 4, 891380) Was it there even before khadi activity started?
('70', 432, 1, 5, 891429) Was it done through the inspiration of some workers?
('70', 432, 1, 6, 891482) How much khadi do they use?
('70', 432, 1, 7, 891510) What is the count of the khadi which they make?
('70', 432, 1, 8, 891558) What is their speed in spinning and carding?
('70', 432, 1, 9, 891603) What are their tools like and what other activities do they pursue?
('70', 432, 1, 10, 891671) Answers to these and similar questions should be obtained with regard to this village.
('70', 432, 1, 11, 891758) If we have this information we shall know why self sufficiency has not been achieved elsewhere.
('70', 432, 1, 12, 891854) Whatever the conditions in this village may be, it is my confirmed belief that we can certainly succeed in such work if we can produce experts in the science of khadi for there is no flaw to be seen in the idea of self sufficiency.
('70', 432, 1, 13, 892086) And it is a historical fact that at one time India was self sufficient in cloth.

('70', 432, 6, 18, 892268) Your letter.
('70', 432, 6, 19, 892281) Although I do not see any reason why honey or dates should cause boils you may consult the doctor.
('70', 432, 6, 20, 892380) The reasons were the lack or insufficiency of milk and green vegetables, excess of wheat and, above all, your fiery temper.
('70', 432, 6, 21, 892504) Knowledge of English is not required of village workers though knowledge of any language is of course good; but I do not think this was the idea behind your question.

('70', 434, 13, 18, 894744) The hardness of my heart is only apparent.
('70', 434, 13, 19, 894787) I would not apply hair oil to a wound from which Kanu was suffering.

('70', 434, 13, 23, 894919) But in truth I was kind.
('70', 434, 13, 24, 894944) What is the use of my calling you here without cause?

('70', 436, 5, 6, 896760) 1. The expression ‘temple’ occurring in these rules shall include not only the temple and sub shrines but also mandapams and other buildings as well as tanks or wells appurtenant to the temple.
