('66', 0, 1, 2, 44) 1. LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK December 16, 1934
('66', 0, 3, 3, 92) Your letters I shall send on to Narandas.
('66', 0, 3, 4, 134) Today also I got up at 1.45 a.m.
('66', 0, 3, 5, 167) and started writing letters.
('66', 0, 3, 6, 196) It has become a habit with me now to wake up at about 2. I go to bed before 9 p.m.
('66', 0, 3, 7, 279) During the day, I take a nap once or twice and get half an hour to one hour.
('66', 0, 3, 8, 356) That seems to be enough for me.
('66', 0, 3, 9, 388) By writing “not revised” I ensure—and do—justice to myself and to the person to whom the letter is addressed.
('66', 0, 3, 10, 498) If by chance I have written “aaj mar gaya” instead of “Ajmer gaya”, the other party may correct the mistake or, in case of doubt, ask me.
('66', 0, 3, 11, 636) A letter which has not been revised should always be regarded as incomplete.
('66', 0, 3, 12, 713) But I would prefer, and so would you, that I write an incomplete letter to you rather than not write any.
('66', 0, 3, 13, 819) Most probably I shall be going to Delhi on or about the 27th.
('66', 0, 3, 14, 881) Continue to write to me at the Wardha address till you hear from me or you read in the papers.
('66', 0, 3, 15, 976) The atonement for any violation of a vow in a dream is generally greater vigilance and Ramanama on waking up from the dream.
('66', 0, 3, 16, 1101) Such violations of vows or moral rules in dreams are signs of our imperfection.
('66', 0, 3, 17, 1181) Unconsciously we harbour deep in our hearts the desires which we gratify in dreams.
('66', 0, 3, 18, 1265) We should not despair because of such dreams, but should become more and more vigilant.
('66', 0, 3, 19, 1353) Despair may be a sign of the person being attached to the senses; it is certainly a sign of his lack of faith.
('66', 0, 3, 20, 1464) If a person tires of repeating Ramanama— despairs about its usefulness—shouldn’t we say that he has lost faith in it?
('66', 0, 3, 21, 1582) When Columbus’s companions lost faith, they wanted to kill him.
('66', 0, 3, 22, 1646) But with his eyes of faith Columbus could clearly see the coast and he asked his companions to give him some more time, and he reached America!
('66', 0, 3, 23, 1790) If a person dreams that he is eating forbidden food, such a dream also means what I have explained above.
('66', 0, 3, 24, 1896) There may be external causes for such dreams and, whenever we discover any, we should remove them.
('66', 0, 3, 25, 1995) “I am the spotless Brahman that is witness of all the states.” This is what we sing.
('66', 0, 3, 26, 2080) We can sing thus only if we strive ceaselessly to be that.
('66', 0, 3, 27, 2139) The dreams that we get are a signthat we have not succeeded in becoming spotless.
('66', 0, 3, 28, 2221) They are a warning light for us.
('66', 1, 0, 1, 2254) 2 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 1, 1, 2, 2294) Not a leaf can stir without God’s grace, but we cannot dispense with human effort either, which is the means through which God’s grace works.
('66', 1, 1, 3, 2436) Realization means nothing but pure and selfless service of all living creatures.
('66', 1, 1, 4, 2517) It is very good indeed that Kisan 1 has decided to stay with you.

('66', 1, 5, 8, 2741) SHIVABHAI, I got your letter.
('66', 1, 5, 9, 2771) Give your wife the freedom that you have reserved for yourself.
('66', 1, 5, 10, 2835) In matters in which both do not agree, each must be free to go his or her own way.
('66', 1, 5, 11, 2918) She should, therefore, get training for using her freedom well.
('66', 1, 5, 12, 2982) I see the good of you both in that.
('66', 1, 5, 13, 3018) Take the fullest interest in village industries work.
('66', 1, 5, 14, 3072) And do not forget that khadi is the center of such work.

('66', 1, 10, 20, 3345) Give me their ages, etc.
('66', 1, 10, 21, 3370) I think you should be content with only so much education as the poor can hope to provide their children.
('66', 1, 10, 22, 3476) Can you do ordinaryreading with your eyes?
('66', 1, 10, 23, 3519) Do you maintain good health in other ways?

('66', 2, 1, 2, 3697) 4. LETTER TO LABHUBEHN A. SHETH
('66', 2, 2, 3, 3729) December 16, 1934
('66', 2, 3, 4, 3747) LABHU, If I had included your name in my letter to Amritlal, I would have been made a fool by your letter, wouldn’t I?
('66', 2, 3, 5, 3866) This is the plight of one who leaves the trodden path.
('66', 2, 3, 6, 3921) Who can tell whether your letter conveys your genuine desire for knowledge or is mere idle prattle?
('66', 2, 3, 7, 4021) But I want to look great in your eyes, hence I must measure up to your yardstick!
('66', 2, 3, 8, 4103) If anything, I am at least four times older than you.
('66', 2, 3, 9, 4157) Am I not?
('66', 2, 3, 10, 4167) How can I tell you where you can find steadiness, as though it were some commodity to be bought in a shop?
('66', 2, 3, 11, 4274) If I were running a grocer’s shop here, this being my ancestral business, I would have sent it over to you without your asking for it.
('66', 2, 3, 12, 4409) You have even sent an advance of one anna.
('66', 2, 3, 13, 4452) You have wasted your years.
('66', 2, 3, 14, 4480) Amritlal is no more worthy of being your father because he has failed to show me something that you have within you.
('66', 2, 3, 15, 4597) But hasn’t the poet said, “The dear ones of the embodied soul are all selfish.” After all isn’t he only your embodied father?
('66', 2, 3, 16, 4723) The one without a body that is your real Father dwells in your own heart.
('66', 2, 3, 17, 4797) Know Him and you will not have to spend even an anna.
('66', 2, 3, 18, 4851) Your learning is illusory if it does not lead you to Him.
('66', 2, 3, 19, 4909) But if you are learning with this aim, you will be able to secure the release of Khan Saheb 1, Sheikh, Jawahar and the others.
('66', 2, 3, 20, 5036) But if you want to indulge in idle talk and play as with dolls then you must cast away the idea of greatness you associate with me or humbly confess that you never had genuine thirst for knowledge.
('66', 2, 3, 21, 5234) Remember in this connection the story of Indra and Virochana.
('66', 2, 3, 22, 5296) If you don’t know it yourself, ask Amritlal and let him also enjoy it and add to your knowledge.

('66', 2, 6, 26, 5500) DEAR SISTER,
('66', 2, 7, 27, 5513) I do hope that your meeting in Karachi 2 will be a full success and that the sisters assembled there will rise above the petty quarrels of men by setting the example of refusing to divide themselves into

('66', 3, 1, 3, 5861) Surely religions are not made to set up quarrels among ourselves.
('66', 3, 1, 4, 5927) I hope too that the meeting will give full support to the activities of the newly formed Village Industries Association.
('66', 3, 1, 5, 6048) It is essentially women’s work.
('66', 3, 1, 6, 6080) Let it not be said of the city women that they cared not for their millions of sisters living in the 700,000 villages.
('66', 3, 1, 7, 6199) Here is a letter 1 for Dr. Maude Royden.
('66', 3, 1, 8, 6240) Your note has just come in.
('66', 3, 1, 9, 6268) The cutting is interesting.
('66', 3, 1, 10, 6296) C.F. Andrews comes in today.
('66', 3, 1, 11, 6325) It was a great joy to meet you both.
('66', 3, 1, 12, 6362) I hope you were physically none the worse for your stay.
('66', 3, 1, 13, 6419) BAPU [PS.] I find that I shall not be in Delhi on 20th as I had intended to be.
('66', 3, 1, 14, 6499) I am likely to be there between 27th 29th.
('66', 3, 1, 15, 6542) Having gone there, I am supposed to stay there two weeks at least and four at the most.

('66', 3, 5, 21, 6877) You have lost yourself in the exuberance of your own language.
('66', 3, 5, 22, 6940) You have missed the spirit of non co operation and civil resistance.
('66', 3, 5, 23, 7009) You have glorified slavery; our vice has become virtue in your estimation.
('66', 3, 5, 24, 7084) I may not argue with you.
('66', 3, 5, 25, 7110) Time will show us the true way.

('66', 5, 8, 16, 9227) The office is not going to be a small one.
('66', 5, 8, 17, 9270) If you are here, I also can use your services in a good many ways if I am free.
('66', 5, 8, 18, 9350) What you say regarding Shankaran is true.
('66', 5, 8, 19, 9392) What can we do if Vijaya herself has become impatient to get married.
('66', 5, 8, 20, 9462) According to me, she is not as yet at all fit to get married.
('66', 5, 8, 21, 9524) Try to dissuade her.
('66', 5, 8, 22, 9545) Most probably I will be leaving for Delhi on the 27th.

('66', 6, 3, 4, 9788) SHARMA, I feel apprehensive in writing to you.
('66', 6, 3, 5, 9835) I got your letter just now.
('66', 6, 3, 6, 9863) I had written nothing that could have provoked you to write such a letter.
('66', 6, 3, 7, 9938) How can a son suspect his father?
('66', 6, 3, 8, 9972) Perhaps I am not worthy of being a true father!
('66', 6, 3, 9, 10020) If no one is keeping well in Khurja, why do you stay on there?
('66', 6, 3, 10, 10083) Go to the Harijan Ashram [Delhi] and live in a separate house there.
('66', 6, 3, 11, 10152) It will not be very expensive.
('66', 6, 3, 12, 10183) Or stay in a village here.
('66', 6, 3, 13, 10210) I cannot put up with your falling ill and continuing to be ill.
('66', 6, 3, 14, 10274) Ramdas will not stay with me.
('66', 6, 3, 15, 10304) He no longer has faith in my treatment though he consults me occasionally.
('66', 6, 3, 16, 10379) He has given up eggs and takes ordinary diet.
('66', 6, 3, 17, 10425) Since yesterday he has resumed living withNimu.
('66', 6, 3, 18, 10473) He is preparing to go to Bombay, for which he has my permission.
('66', 6, 3, 19, 10538) He has gained a fair amount of strength and moves about by himself.
('66', 6, 3, 20, 10606) I am not worried on his account.
('66', 6, 3, 21, 10639) In the end it will be all right for him.
('66', 6, 3, 22, 10680) Amtul left for Bombay the day before yesterday and will probably reach Delhi by the end of this month.
('66', 6, 3, 23, 10783) May be I shall be able to go to Delhi only after the 27th.
('66', 6, 3, 24, 10842) Your note appeared in last week’s Harijanbandhu and in this week’s Harijan.
('66', 6, 3, 25, 10918) Owing to an oversight it was delayed for a week.
('66', 6, 3, 26, 10967) As soon as your letter came I sent instructions for a copy of the Harijan to be sent to you.
('66', 6, 3, 27, 11060) I got a letter today from Dr. Ansari and among other things he writes this about you:
('66', 6, 4, 28, 11146) As regards Dr. Sharma, I would like to see him and find out his exact requirements and then I may be able to help him.
('66', 6, 5, 29, 11265) It would be good if you went to Delhi.
('66', 6, 5, 30, 11304) If you wish you may go there after my arrival.
('66', 6, 5, 31, 11351) You yourself told me that you were responsible for your brothers not writing to me.
('66', 6, 5, 32, 11435) Can they be so lacking in manners as not even to reply to me?
('66', 6, 5, 33, 11497) If you have not seen them so far, is it not an instance of your haphazard ways?
('66', 6, 5, 34, 11577) But if you do not yourself realize this, I can hardly make you see it.
('66', 6, 5, 35, 11648) I see nothing but lack of coherence in your talk, your actions and your letters.
('66', 6, 5, 36, 11729) I was under the impression that you were conscious of it.

('66', 7, 13, 31, 12843) The enclosed letter is for your perusal.
('66', 7, 13, 32, 12884) If the land required by Kshitishbabu is not of use to you and is not too valuable either, you may give it away to him and take back Rs. 1,500. If, however, it is valuable, I have nothing to say.

('66', 8, 3, 4, 13279) Of the many happy memories of the late Maulana, the one that persists most with me, is the gift by him, on the conclusion of my fast of 21 days at Delhi, of a cow as an earnest of his intense desire to see heart unity among Hindus and Mussalmans.
('66', 8, 3, 5, 13526) 2 If he had been with us, he would have raised his voice against the recent deliberate murder of the two Hindus 3 who foolishly criticized the Prophet of Islam.
('66', 8, 3, 6, 13687) Now— alas!—one hears these murders being extolled publicly as if they were meritorious acts.
('66', 8, 3, 7, 13780) I wonder whether you and your League have taken any steps to educate the public along the right path.

('66', 8, 8, 20, 14236) Yes, we must meet.
('66', 8, 8, 21, 14255) Since you have time, you have to be humble enough to ask for the responsibility you can shoulder — work of the highest order, with or without office, whichever is better for your work.
('66', 8, 8, 22, 14440) In this service of the destitute, there is no room for ceremony.
('66', 8, 8, 23, 14505) And this business of rice, flour, gur, oil, ghee, etc., is a vast business.

('66', 11, 3, 4, 18764) The Board of Management has framed a set of rules defining the duties of agents under bye law No.

('66', 11, 3, 6, 19000) After he has made a fair start with the Central Office programme, he will be expected to make a survey of all such industries that may be revived, improved or introduced in his area and shall forthwith report to the Central Office results of his investigations and submit a programme of work based thereon for examination by the Office.
('66', 11, 3, 7, 19337) (2) Every agent will be expected to attend to the sanitation and hygiene of the villages within his area.
('66', 11, 3, 8, 19443) (3) With a view to finding markets for the surplus products of the villages, he should induce reliable merchants to store village products for sale, at prices mutually fixed between the merchants and the agent and so as to ensure the genuineness of such products.
('66', 11, 3, 9, 19707) (4) He should carry on an intensive propaganda to create a favourable public opinion for the programme in his area.
('66', 11, 3, 10, 19823) (5) He may invite and receive subscriptions and donations to meet the expenses in connection with his work and should not expect any financial aid from the Central Office.
('66', 11, 3, 11, 19995) But he shall not utilize any part of the funds so collected by him for his own personal require ments.
('66', 11, 3, 12, 20098) (6) He may appoint, whenever necessary, and if funds at his disposal permit, paid workers needed for his work.
('66', 11, 3, 13, 20209) (7) He shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements, which will be subject to audit by the Central Office.
('66', 11, 3, 14, 20334) (8) His work will be subject to the inspection and supervision of the Central Office.
('66', 11, 3, 15, 20420) (9) He shall submit a report of his work and an abstract of receipts and payments for every month so as to reach the Central Office not later than the 15th of the month following.

('66', 12, 1, 6, 21157) The chief thing to bear in mind is that no one should take charge of more villages than he can manage, with or without the help of co workers whom he has to find, and that the Board is to undertake no financial responsibility.
('66', 12, 1, 7, 21384) It is felt that the Board can never cover all the seven hundred thousand villages of India, if it is to employ paid agency.
('66', 12, 1, 8, 21508) It has started work with the belief that there are self sacri ficing men and women enough who realize the necessity of serving the villages, which have remained long neglected, though everyone knows that city life would be impossible if there were no villages to serve them.

('66', 12, 5, 12, 21851) MY DEAR AGATHA, I have your doleful letter.
('66', 12, 5, 13, 21895) The situation does not disturb us here as much as it disturbs you.
('66', 12, 5, 14, 21962) The thing is you do not know Sir Samuel Hoare.
('66', 12, 5, 15, 22009) The Indian Government has always been a one man rule.
('66', 12, 5, 16, 22063) Sir Samuel Hoare’s philosophy demands that Indian wishes should not be consulted, much less respected, except when they reflect those of his advisers.
('66', 12, 5, 17, 22214) The latter have made up their minds that the White Paper 1, now the J. P. C. 2 Report, is the last word.
('66', 12, 5, 18, 22319) The Congress has decided that nothing is acceptable unless its wishes are taken into account.
('66', 12, 5, 19, 22413) The Congress also recognizes that Sir Samuel holds the power and that the Congress must not use the little power that it has got.
('66', 12, 5, 20, 22543) Therefore you friends on your side should, if you can, resolutely saythat the existing state should remain till time has arrived for a change by consent of the ‘governed’.
('66', 12, 5, 21, 22715) Not that even your effort will succeed.
('66', 12, 5, 22, 22755) But you will at least have the satisfaction of knowing that you had done the right

('66', 13, 1, 2, 23118) If, on the other hand, the friends over there think that they cannot conscientiously take up that attitude and that they must accept the Report if it cannot be changed, you must prosecute that plan.
('66', 13, 1, 3, 23317) If I were they, I should sit silent, since I could not represent the Indian view.
('66', 13, 1, 4, 23399) The friends at least may be no party directly or indirectly to ‘imposing’ by force a constitution on India, which would be the case if the constitution is passed.
('66', 13, 1, 5, 23562) Read Chintamani’s warning enclosed.
('66', 13, 1, 6, 23598) Not that it means much.
('66', 13, 1, 7, 23622) The Home Member was quite clear on the point.
('66', 13, 1, 8, 23668) But his being clear was a cruel reminder of India’s present helpless ness.

('66', 13, 1, 14, 23884) He is fighting like a Trojan against the heaviest odds and he will presently give you all the latest news.
('66', 13, 1, 15, 23991) Meanwhile you and other friends should rest assured that I shall take no hasty step.
('66', 13, 1, 16, 24076) Ample warning will be given of my intentions.
('66', 13, 1, 17, 24122) But what are my intentions worth!

('66', 14, 1, 2, 24859) 20. EXPANSION OF “HARIJAN”
('66', 14, 2, 3, 24886) Some readers have taken exception to the way in which the columns of Harijan are being occupied with the development of the village industries scheme, and some others have welcomed the change in what they had thought was monotony of presentation.
('66', 14, 2, 4, 25133) Either opinion is probably hasty.
('66', 14, 2, 5, 25167) Any problem connected with the welfare of villages as a whole must be intimately related to the Harijans, who represent over a sixth part of India’s population.
('66', 14, 2, 6, 25328) If villages get good rice and flour, Harijans will benefit by the change as much as the rest of the population.
('66', 14, 2, 7, 25440) But there is a special sense in which Harijans will benefit.
('66', 14, 2, 8, 25501) Tanning and the whole of the raw hide work is their monopoly, and economically this will occupy perhaps the best part of the new scheme.
('66', 14, 2, 9, 25638) Indeed, Harijans, in so far as they have given their opinion, have welcomed the expansion.
('66', 14, 2, 10, 25729) Those who were tired of monotony were also in my opinion wrong.
('66', 14, 2, 11, 25793) The pages of Harijan could not be filled with matters that had no connection, direct or indirect, with those in whose interest it was being published.
('66', 14, 2, 12, 25944) Those who complained of monotony were perhaps not sufficiently interested in the cause.
('66', 14, 2, 13, 26032) No doubt it would be true criticism if I were told that the columns of Harijan were not as interesting as they might be made.
('66', 14, 2, 14, 26158) There are causes for this which are inherent in the movement itself.
('66', 14, 2, 15, 26227) It must be confessed that removal of untouchability is not a popular cause in the sense in which great political movements have been and become popular all over the world.
('66', 14, 2, 16, 26399) Removal of untouchability is a mighty social reform.
('66', 14, 2, 17, 26452) But it cannot furnish sensations.
('66', 14, 2, 18, 26486) It is a plodder’s work.
('66', 14, 2, 19, 26510) And record of the work of plodders requires editorial gifts of a high order to make it interesting.
('66', 14, 2, 20, 26610) Plodders can only attract plodding editors.
('66', 14, 2, 21, 26654) Therefore, the only way before those who are inti mately connected with the Harijan movement is to continue to work with an ever increasing faith in the cause and leave the result to take care of itself.
('66', 14, 2, 22, 26858) A little time ago there appeared in the Press a paragraph that the Gujarati edition of Harijan known as Harijanbandhu was about to be stopped, because it was being run at a loss.
('66', 14, 2, 23, 27037) The news was premature and unauthorized.
('66', 14, 2, 24, 27078) There was indeed a talk about it.
('66', 14, 2, 25, 27112) But when Thakkar Bapa heard of it, he soon smashed it by saying that noneof the three editions, Hindi, Gujarati and English, could be stopped.
('66', 14, 2, 26, 27255) The remedies available for avoiding losses on these weeklies are three:
('66', 15, 0, 1, 27327) 16 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 15, 1, 2, 27368) (1) Raising of subscription; (2) Voluntary reduction by the printing and editorial staff in the remuneration they receive for their labours; (3) An appeal for increase in the number of subscribers.
('66', 15, 1, 3, 27566) The second remedy has been, and is still being, tried.
('66', 15, 1, 4, 27621) Reduction in the expense of publishing the papers is being steadily pursued.
('66', 15, 1, 5, 27698) There is limitless scope for increase in the number of subscribers.
('66', 15, 1, 6, 27766) And now that village industries and general village uplift is to occupy a fair portion of Harijan, there should be an automatic increase in the number of subscribers.

('66', 15, 4, 9, 27970) The much talked of All India Village Industries Association was born amid calm surroundings and without any fuss or ceremony on the 14th instant at Wardha, which will be its headquarters by reason of the munificence of Sheth Jamnalalji, who has set apart ample ground with buildings for the use of the Association.
('66', 15, 4, 10, 28285) Of this, however, here after.
('66', 15, 4, 11, 28315) Let us make the acquaintance of the foundation members who are the first Board of Management.
('66', 15, 4, 12, 28409) Shri Shrikrishnadas Jajooji, the President, is a lawyer who had a distinguished career during his school and college days.
('66', 15, 4, 13, 28532) He left a lucrative practice long ago.
('66', 15, 4, 14, 28571) He has been identified with the philanthropic activities of Sheth Jamnalalji and is the President of the All India Spinners’ Association, Maharashtra Branch.
('66', 15, 4, 15, 28729) Shri Kumarappa, the Organizer and Secretary, is a Chartered Accountant, who years ago left a growing practice in Bombay and took up under Kakasaheb Kalelkar honorary appointment as Pro fessor at the Gujarat Vidyapith.
('66', 15, 4, 16, 28947) He served, with Sjts.
('66', 15, 4, 17, 28969) Bhulabhai Desai and D. N. Bahadurji, ex Advocate Generals, on the Public Debts Committee appointed by the Congress, and has been the financial adviser of the Bihar Central Relief Committee.
('66', 15, 4, 18, 29159) Shri Gosibehn Captain is one of the four indefatigable Naoroji sisters who have for years been completely identified with khadi and been responsible for conducting khadi embroidery classes for poor girls in Bombay started by Shri Mithubehn Petit, who has dedicated herself to the service of the poor in the villages of Gujarat.

('66', 16, 1, 2, 29532) Sheth Shoorji Vallabhdas is a well known merchant of Bombay.
('66', 16, 1, 3, 29593) He has been organizing khadi centres and has brought into being the Swadeshi Bazaar, of which the dividend, if any, is to be devoted solely to the promotion of village industries.
('66', 16, 1, 4, 29773) Dr. Khan Saheb (ex I. M. S.) is the elder brother of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan.
('66', 16, 1, 5, 29851) He takes the place of his brother who, but for his incarceration, would have been a member of the Board.
('66', 16, 1, 6, 29956) Shri Lakshmidas Purushottam was a well known merchant in Malabar before he gave up his business to join the Satyagraha Ashram at Sabarmati.
('66', 16, 1, 7, 30096) It was he who organized khadi in Gujarat, became the right hand man of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel during the terrible floods of Gujarat in the year 1927 and has been likewise to Rajendrababu in the earthquake relief work in Bihar.
('66', 16, 1, 8, 30325) Dr. Profulla Ghosh (D. Sc.) is among the favourite early pupils of Dr. P. C. Ray, who, leaving a high post at the Government Mint, has for years been living on a mere pittance and has devoted his life to public service.
('66', 16, 1, 9, 30545) Shri Shankerlal Banker (M. A.) studied advanced chemistry in England and on return entered public life in 1916. He is the Secretary and soul of the All India Spinners’ Association and possesses an all round knowledge of khadi and, therefore, of the condition of villages, possessed, perhaps, by no one in the same extensive manner as he does.
('66', 16, 1, 10, 30888) Thus, with the exception of Sheth Shoorjibhai, the Board contains members who have no private finance or business to look after and whose sole concern would be in one way or another to consult the welfare of the villagers in everything they do.
('66', 16, 1, 11, 31133) They are all on the Board solely to shoulder the tremendous responsibility of striving to carry out the object of the Association.
('66', 16, 1, 12, 31264) The reader will study the simple constitution of the Association.
('66', 16, 1, 13, 31330) 1 If it is assisted by the public in a tangible manner, it will give hope to the millions of villagers; it will turn the city dwellers who are today their exploiters, into real helpers and servants; it will establish a living link between the intelligentsia and the illiterate masses; it will be instrumental in abolishing all distinctions between man and man, and it will turn the villagers from being mere creaters of raw produce, which they have

('66', 17, 1, 2, 31886) practically become, into self sustained units and caterers for most of the requirements of city dwellers.
('66', 17, 1, 3, 31992) In a task such as this, naturally political differences are sunk, all who will assist are invited to join asmembers, agents, workers, associates or advisers, according to their wishes and capacity.
('66', 17, 1, 4, 32190) The task is tremendous.
('66', 17, 1, 5, 32214) Nothing but Divine Grace can fulfill the expectations raised about the work of the Association.
('66', 17, 1, 6, 32310) And Divine Grace only attends intelligent, tireless effort.
('66', 17, 1, 7, 32370) The members of the Board are pledged to such effort.
('66', 17, 1, 8, 32423) Their past record is an earnest of the future.
('66', 17, 1, 9, 32470) The Association, though it is a creation of the Congress, has been deliberately made non political and autonomous.
('66', 17, 1, 10, 32585) Its members are pledged, whilst they remain such, to abstain from any campaign of civil disobedience.
('66', 17, 1, 11, 32687) As its adviser and guide, I can say that the Asso ciation has no further aim than that of bringing about the economic, physical and moral betterment of the villagers.
('66', 17, 1, 12, 32854) The reader will observe that the work of the Board of Management is to be done through honorary agents, at least in the first instance.
('66', 17, 1, 13, 32990) The agents have to select their own areas of operation, and they will be expected to confine themselves to, and to concentrate their attention on, those areas only.
('66', 17, 1, 14, 33155) There may thus be an agent even for one single village.
('66', 17, 1, 15, 33211) The Association may, therefore, have as many agents as there are villages in India.
('66', 17, 1, 16, 33295) Therefore, no honest person, however humble, need be deterred from offering his or her services.
('66', 17, 1, 17, 33392) The idea is to decentralize the work as much as possible.
('66', 17, 1, 18, 33450) Thus alone can intensive work be done with the utmost economy consistent with efficiency.
('66', 17, 1, 19, 33540) I hope that willing and honest workers will be found all over the country to take part in this glorious work of voluntary village reconstruction.

('66', 17, 5, 26, 33913) And Mira wanted to express through her speech nothing but what she believed to be the whole truth.

('66', 21, 4, 7, 37993) Gomati is better now.
('66', 21, 4, 8, 38015) Kishorelal still has a temperature.
('66', 21, 4, 9, 38051) It is coming down, however.
('66', 21, 4, 10, 38079) Preparations are under way for shifting the Industries Association to the garden.
('66', 21, 4, 11, 38161) It has been planned to add two rooms on the top of the building.
('66', 21, 4, 12, 38226) Radhakisan had suggested one.
('66', 21, 4, 13, 38256) Now they are thinking of two.
('66', 21, 4, 14, 38286) The plan involves an expenditure of about Rs. 2,000. It is not absolutely necessary of course to build the rooms.
('66', 21, 4, 15, 38400) They will be useful mostly during the monsoon.
('66', 21, 4, 16, 38447) During day time I can remain on the ground floor.
('66', 21, 4, 17, 38497) But at night I would certainly go up to sleep.
('66', 21, 4, 18, 38544) These rooms should be built only in view of their usefulness for the future.
('66', 21, 4, 19, 38621) Since the suggestion was made, I was tempted to give my consent.
('66', 21, 4, 20, 38686) If you refuse yours, the matter will end and Rs. 2,000 will be saved.
('66', 21, 4, 21, 38756) You know that the money is no longer yours.
('66', 21, 4, 22, 38800) As I write this, I feel that I myself ought to be firm and forbid the construction of the rooms for the present at any rate.

('66', 21, 4, 24, 38939) Please treat as cancelled what I have written above.

('66', 22, 1, 22, 40762) It is an extremely difficult problem.
('66', 22, 1, 23, 40800) Since our outlooks are completely different, we have no option but to endure things.
('66', 22, 1, 24, 40885) We should be satisfied if we do the best we can.

('66', 23, 8, 20, 42490) With me it is not a matter of sacrificing anything for anything else.
('66', 23, 8, 21, 42560) Is not the vast meaning of sacrifice self purification?

('66', 23, 13, 30, 42909) Harakhchand and Vijaya passed through here today.

('66', 24, 1, 2, 43152) You must have observed that Jamna 1 is not happy at the thought of your leaving the place.
('66', 24, 1, 3, 43243) It is for you to decide.
('66', 24, 1, 4, 43268) If your presence there is essential, then I would not think at all of drawing you away from there.
('66', 24, 1, 5, 43367) I once put this question to you.
('66', 24, 1, 6, 43400) Think over it again if necessary.
('66', 24, 1, 7, 43434) Ramdas is very eager that his two children should secure admission to an infant school somewhere.
('66', 24, 1, 8, 43532) If that is done, Nimu should stay with them.
('66', 24, 1, 9, 43577) Ramdas thinks that Bhavnagar will suit very well.
('66', 24, 1, 10, 43627) But, then, where would Nimu stay in Bhavnagar?
('66', 24, 1, 11, 43674) What would happen if any of them was taken ill?
('66', 24, 1, 12, 43722) I, therefore, have advised him to send the children to Rajkot and the idea has appealed to Nimu.
('66', 24, 1, 13, 43819) I have told him that the Bal Mandir there will continue to run whether or not you remain.
('66', 24, 1, 14, 43909) Am I right?
('66', 24, 1, 15, 43921) Send me a report about its affairs and let me know whether you would advise Nimu to bring the children there.
('66', 24, 1, 16, 44031) Address the reply to me at Birla Mills, Delhi.
('66', 24, 1, 17, 44078) Drop a brief note to Nimu as well.
('66', 24, 1, 18, 44113) I think Ramdas must have gone to Bombay.
('66', 24, 1, 19, 44154) He cannot be said to have fully recovered yet.
('66', 24, 1, 20, 44201) He is following a treatment of his own choice at present.
('66', 24, 1, 21, 44259) He can move about a little.
('66', 24, 1, 22, 44287) Nimu also wants to learn.
('66', 24, 1, 23, 44313) She is taking lessons in playing on the sitar and learning English.
('66', 24, 1, 24, 44381) I have told her that it can be done even there.
('66', 24, 1, 25, 44429) A letter for Aunt 2 is enclosed.

('66', 25, 13, 22, 45889) I am no represen tative of the domain of literature.
('66', 25, 13, 23, 45942) I have no University qualifica tions.
('66', 25, 13, 24, 45980) I cannot write after my name even a “a failed B. A.”, having never gone beyond the London Matriculation.
('66', 25, 13, 25, 46085) Nor can I call myself a literary man by training.
('66', 25, 13, 26, 46135) I am no judge of prose, much less of poetry.
('66', 25, 13, 27, 46180) Some of the latter I cannot understand.

('66', 29, 1, 3, 50845) Do the majority need to die, so that the few city people may live?
('66', 29, 1, 4, 50912) My humble attempt is to show that the villagers do not need to die and that they have an inherent capacity to live if they would but shed their laziness and make a corporate effort to live.
('66', 29, 1, 5, 51102) City people have no such inherent capacity.
('66', 29, 1, 6, 51146) Hence like Genghis they have to produce human hecatombs.

('66', 30, 6, 9, 52817) JAMNALAL,
('66', 30, 7, 10, 52827) Please do not insist on the construction of the two rooms just now.
('66', 30, 7, 11, 52895) I have refused my consent after thinking about the matter very carefully.
('66', 30, 7, 12, 52969) Isn’t all your money a Trust now?
('66', 30, 7, 13, 53003) It will continue to yield sufficient income only if we save every pie that we can.
('66', 30, 7, 14, 53086) This is true whether the property belongs to a private firm or to a Trust for the poor.
('66', 30, 7, 15, 53174) In fact, we should exercise more care in the case of the latter.
('66', 30, 7, 16, 53239) I have not been able to prepare a draft for the Maganlal Memorial.
('66', 30, 7, 17, 53306) Most probably I shall draw up one.
('66', 30, 7, 18, 53341) I shall be very happy if nothing happens to Abhyankar.
('66', 30, 7, 19, 53396) Tell him when you meet him that I frequently think of him.
('66', 30, 7, 20, 53455) Khan Saheb is going to Delhi with me.
('66', 30, 7, 21, 53493) Mehr too will be there.
('66', 30, 7, 22, 53517) She also is doing well.
('66', 30, 7, 23, 53541) At present Anand’s father and Vaikunth Mehta are here.
('66', 30, 7, 24, 53596) The latter has returned after a world tour.

('66', 31, 3, 4, 53907) BHAISHRI VALLABHBHAI, I got your letter.
('66', 31, 3, 5, 53948) I have written to Gangadharrao.
('66', 31, 3, 6, 53980) Jamnalal had sent me his letter.
('66', 31, 3, 7, 54013) I was not convinced by his argument.
('66', 31, 3, 8, 54050) I have, therefore, asked him to come to Delhi.
('66', 31, 3, 9, 54097) How long can we go on meeting the deficit in this manner?
('66', 31, 3, 10, 54155) And from whom are we to beg the money?
('66', 31, 3, 11, 54194) You must have read Brelvi’s article about the murders in Karachi and Lahore.
('66', 31, 3, 12, 54271) I will see now what can be done in Delhi.
('66', 31, 3, 13, 54313) There was a letter from Andrews.
('66', 31, 3, 14, 54346) He is hopeful.
('66', 31, 3, 15, 54361) He is expected today.
('66', 31, 3, 16, 54383) I don’t think his being hopeful means anything.
('66', 31, 3, 17, 54431) Dr. Khan Saheb was served an order by the Punjab Government too.
('66', 31, 3, 18, 54496) But he had to go to Delhi.
('66', 31, 3, 19, 54523) So he asked me what he should do, since he would have to pass through the Punjab on his way.
('66', 31, 3, 20, 54616) I, therefore, sent a wire to the Punjab Government asking whether the order also covered the railway stations.
('66', 31, 3, 21, 54727) A reply to that has been received saying that the order was being withdrawn with effect from the 28th.
('66', 31, 3, 22, 54830) And the Frontier order is expiring on the 29th in the natural course.
('66', 31, 3, 23, 54900) If, therefore, they don’t renew it, Khan Saheb will be able to enter the Frontier Province also.
('66', 31, 3, 24, 54997) Mehr, as has already been arranged, is coming along with me.
('66', 31, 3, 25, 55058) She will have no company—except mine, of course.
('66', 31, 3, 26, 55107) Vaikunth Mehta is here in connection with the Village Industries Association.
('66', 31, 3, 27, 55185) He will stay for two more days yet.
('66', 31, 3, 28, 55221) I understand what you say regarding the nose.
('66', 31, 3, 29, 55267) Since the doctors forbid you, we are helpless.
('66', 31, 3, 30, 55314) Be quite firm about the constructive work.
('66', 31, 3, 31, 55357) If the people do not overcome their lethargy and attend to the essential tasks, there will be no Satyagraha movement and no swaraj.

('66', 32, 5, 10, 56239) Dr. Ansari’s is the latest reasoned opinion received on unpolished rice, whole wheatmeal and gur.
('66', 32, 5, 11, 56337) I share it with the readers.
('66', 32, 5, 12, 56366) The same kind of categorical replies have been received also from other eminent medical men.
('66', 32, 5, 13, 56459) A digest of these is being prepared by Sjt.
('66', 32, 5, 14, 56503) Kumarappa and will be duly published in these columns.
('66', 32, 5, 15, 56558) Mean while let workers and others ponder over the following: 1
('66', 32, 6, 16, 56621) In the process of polishing rice, all outer coverings of the grain are removed, consisting of the husk as well as the pigmented covering containing Vitamin B, fat and protein, which are necessary for health and growth.
('66', 32, 6, 17, 56840) It has been proved that the absence of Vitamin B from polished rice has been instrumental in causing beri beri.
('66', 32, 6, 18, 56952) Unpolished rice, on the other hand, not being subjected to the boiling process used in polishing rice in the mills, retains Vitamin B as well as the protein, fat and mineral matter.
('66', 32, 7, 19, 57134) The wheat grain consists of bran or outer envelope, mainly composed of cellulose, the kernel consisting of starch and the germ consisting of soluble starch, protein and some fat.
('66', 32, 8, 20, 57313) In the process of milling, the germ and the bran are rejected, and with it undoubtedly are discarded some of the most useful chemical constituent of the wheat, for with the germ a considerable amount of protein and fat are lost, and with the bran are lost mineral matter as well as some protein.
('66', 32, 9, 21, 57609) Gur, jaggery or molasses is produced as by product in the manufacture of crystallized sugar.
('66', 32, 9, 22, 57702) Gur, consisting of cane sugar and fruitsugar in the

('66', 33, 0, 1, 57791) 34 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 33, 1, 2, 57832) proportion of 2 to 1, would be assimilated more rapidly than cane sugar alone taken in the same quantity.
('66', 33, 1, 3, 57938) Therefore, the nutritive value of gur is at least 33 p.c.
('66', 33, 1, 4, 57996) superior to refined sugar.
('66', 33, 1, 5, 58023) The truth of the opinion can be tested by everybody for himself by trying pure gur, chakki ground whole wheatmeal and hand pounded unpolished rice.

('66', 33, 4, 14, 58427) But do try to gin the cotton there.
('66', 33, 4, 15, 58463) Take curds instead of milk if food produces wind.
('66', 33, 4, 16, 58513) Take a little rice instead of chapatis.
('66', 33, 4, 17, 58553) Do not give up leafy vegetables and fruit.

('66', 33, 8, 25, 58926) WARDHA, December 28, 1934
('66', 33, 9, 26, 58952) PRABHUDAS, I have dictated acknowledgment of your letter long before.
('66', 33, 9, 27, 59022) The figure of thirteen yards as average consumption per person, is quite correct.
('66', 33, 9, 28, 59104) That figure certainly includes the consumption by the naked millions.
('66', 33, 9, 29, 59174) It would not therefore be surprising if in Guleria where persons like you can live, the average figure comes to fifty yards per person.
('66', 33, 9, 30, 59310) It is possible that the quantity purchased by the families you
('66', 34, 0, 1, 59373) VOL.66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 35
('66', 34, 1, 2, 59418) surveyed was higher.
('66', 34, 1, 3, 59439) What surprised all of us was that according to your figures, Japanese calico is dearer than Indian calico and khadi is cheaper than any variety of calico.
('66', 34, 1, 4, 59594) In the towns and all over Gujarat, the situation is quite the reverse of what your figures suggest.
('66', 34, 1, 5, 59694) In Ras, khadi will certainly be dearer than mill cloth.
('66', 34, 1, 6, 59750) Look further into this matter.
('66', 34, 1, 7, 59781) After ascertaining what the Harijan Sangh can do for Tika ramji write to me again.
('66', 34, 1, 8, 59864) I will arrange something for him.
('66', 34, 1, 9, 59898) Why should not the Harijan Sangh itself give him all he needs?
('66', 34, 1, 10, 59961) Write to me, after arranging for the agency for that place.
('66', 34, 1, 11, 60021) We are today leaving for Delhi.
('66', 34, 1, 12, 60053) We will return any day between the 20th and the 29th.
('66', 34, 1, 13, 60107) Write to me at Delhi.
('66', 34, 1, 14, 60129) If Kashi finds the cold unbearable, send her away soon.
('66', 34, 1, 15, 60185) If the daughter is to be named with a word beginning with the letter ‘I’ and if she has not already been given a name, I think ‘Indumati’ will be quite good.

('66', 35, 6, 8, 61330) December 29, 1934
('66', 35, 7, 9, 61348) Mahatma Gandhi said that he hoped to leave Delhi on January 28, 1935, as he must be at Wardha positively on the 29th.
('66', 35, 7, 10, 61466) His work here is primarily concerned with Harijan uplift in this area, and also the promotion of village industries nearabouts.
('66', 35, 7, 11, 61594) He wished to make it perfectly clear that his visit had no connection with the work in the new Assembly, which begins on January 21. It was by pure accident that the Assembly work of Congressmen commences at a time when Mahatma Gandhi is here in connection with Harijan and village uplift work.
('66', 35, 8, 12, 61889) Questioned about his proposal to visit the Frontier in view of the Viceroy’s advice against it, Mahatma Gandhi said: It is beyond me and I have nothing to say at present.

('66', 35, 12, 17, 62249) Why this height of 16 feet, and these heavy pillars and this high plinth?
('66', 35, 12, 18, 62323) A simple cutcha hut with grass thatched roof was the one I had in mind and had expected to find here.
('66', 35, 12, 19, 62425) It should not have cost more than Rs. 500, whereas this has cost Rs. 2,500.
('66', 35, 13, 20, 62501) [MALKANI:] The thing had to be hurriedly arranged.
('66', 35, 13, 21, 62552) We have not had more than two rooms, we thought we should have a small terrace where we could have a little

('66', 36, 1, 3, 62882) We went in for iron beams and rafters, as wooden ones would have taken much time.
('66', 36, 1, 4, 62964) [G.] No excuse at all.
('66', 36, 1, 5, 62987) If you knew that this thing was going to cost so much, why did you not give up the idea altogether?
('66', 36, 1, 6, 63087) I should have been perfectly comfortable in a tent.
('66', 36, 1, 7, 63139) The pity is that you for got that you were the representative of Harijans and villagers.
('66', 36, 1, 8, 63228) You acted as Sjt.
('66', 36, 1, 9, 63246) Ghanshyamdas’s representative.
('66', 36, 1, 10, 63277) If you had engaged some villa gers to put up a genuine, bonafide village hut, you would have had a sample of the work that our villagers can still do, and it would have conformed to our standard.
('66', 36, 1, 11, 63473) And why this spiral staircase?
('66', 36, 1, 12, 63504) You might easily have procured a wooden staircase!
('66', 36, 2, 13, 63555) [M.] No Bapu, it has been borrowed and will be returned as soon as we do not need it.
('66', 36, 3, 14, 63641) In the evening, to cap the tale of our woe, came a newly bought spittoon, and it was placed on his table by an unwary friend.
('66', 36, 3, 15, 63767) That was the signal for a final explosion.
('66', 36, 3, 16, 63810) [G.] Who ordered this end why was it purchased?
('66', 36, 4, 17, 63858) [BRIJKRISHNA:] I had asked for one.
('66', 36, 4, 18, 63894) I thought it would be borrowed.
('66', 36, 5, 19, 63926) [G.] But did you not also know that if it could not be imme diately borrowed, the friends in the town were sure to purchase it?
('66', 36, 6, 20, 64054) [B.] I knew, but I had not thought that a thing costing a rupee and a half would be purchased.
('66', 36, 6, 21, 64149) I should have gone in for one costing four annas or so.
('66', 36, 7, 22, 64205) [G.] And you would not have minded four annas!
('66', 36, 7, 23, 64252) Well, send this back at once.
('66', 36, 7, 24, 64282) I should be satisfied with a small earthen cup which costs almost nothing.
('66', 36, 7, 25, 64357) I thought you would instinctively understand these things.
('66', 36, 7, 26, 64416) Well, now let me tell you that if anything is purchased without my permission, I might be driven to non co operation with you.
('66', 36, 8, 27, 64543) It was bed time.
('66', 36, 8, 28, 64560) Beds were being brought, and immediately Gandhiji said:
('66', 36, 9, 29, 64616) No bed stead necessary.
('66', 36, 9, 30, 64640) The cotton mattress over the mat is quite enough.
('66', 36, 9, 31, 64690) Not that I should not use it if health made it imperative, but I should do without it as long as I could.
('66', 36, 10, 32, 64796) But, Bapu, even the poorest villagers have got their charpais.
('66', 36, 11, 33, 64859) [G.] I know, I know.
('66', 36, 11, 34, 64880) Does that mean that we should imitate them in that convenient matter, when we cannot possibly imitate them in other things?
('66', 36, 11, 35, 65004) If we cannot live like them, must have better food and better clothing, let us at least have the poor consolation of doing without a bed stead.

('66', 37, 2, 3, 65234) DELHI, BIRLA HOUSE, December 30, 1934
('66', 37, 3, 4, 65272) SWAMI ANAND,
('66', 37, 4, 5, 65285) l have been able to read your letter only today after I started my silence.
('66', 37, 4, 6, 65361) You may get the Trust Deed for the Thana land registered in your, Jabirali’s and Shrilal’s names or in the names of any other persons suggested by you as soon as you are ready with the necessary arrangements.
('66', 37, 4, 7, 65570) Meanwhile you may use the land for purposes of village industries, khadi, service of Harijans and such other work of public service.
('66', 37, 4, 8, 65703) Continue to pay the revenue dues of the land.
('66', 37, 4, 9, 65749) Send copies of this letter to Narandas and Chhaganlal so that they may know what is happening.
('66', 37, 4, 10, 65844) If you think I should write anything more besides this, ask me.
('66', 37, 4, 11, 65908) The pit in which water collects should either be filled up or the space surrounding should be dug up and levelled to form a drain.
('66', 37, 4, 12, 66039) If we work with our own hands, this is an easy and cheap way of doing the thing.
('66', 37, 4, 13, 66120) But this can be decided only after inspecting the land.
('66', 37, 4, 14, 66176) This method is not practicable in the case of every type of land.
('66', 37, 5, 15, 66242) Blessings from BAPU

('66', 37, 8, 18, 66353) December 30, 1934
('66', 37, 9, 19, 66371) Crores of women who can spin and weave are starving at present.
('66', 37, 9, 20, 66435) We should wear khadi so that they may get a piece of bread, if nothing more.
('66', 37, 9, 21, 66512) We regard it as a matter of dharma to treat crores of Harijans as untouchables.
('66', 37, 9, 22, 66592) By boycotting Chamars, Dheds, etc.
('66', 37, 9, 23, 66627) we alienate them from our culture.
('66', 37, 9, 24, 66662) No industry or profession through which one tries to earn an honest livelihood, can be regarded as degrading.
('66', 37, 9, 25, 66772) It will be impossible to protect the cow if we do not win over the Harijans.
('66', 37, 9, 26, 66849) Hides worth crores of rupees are exported from our country.
('66', 37, 9, 27, 66909) It is our folly that we export more hides than any other

('66', 38, 1, 3, 67033) By doing that, we deprive the Harijans of a means of livelihood.
('66', 38, 1, 4, 67098) It is a great sin, a crime, to consider any human being as inferior to ourselves.

('66', 38, 5, 8, 67246) BIRLA MILLS, DELHI, December 31, 1934
('66', 38, 6, 9, 67284) PREMA, It is about 6 a.m.
('66', 38, 6, 10, 67310) now, but it is pitch dark outside.
('66', 38, 6, 11, 67345) My hands are stiff with cold.
('66', 38, 6, 12, 67375) It is waste land all around where I am staying.
('66', 38, 6, 13, 67423) A Harijan Ashram is to be established here.
('66', 38, 6, 14, 67467) Two rooms have been built for special use.
('66', 38, 6, 15, 67510) In addition there are three or four tents.
('66', 38, 6, 16, 67553) I got your letter.
('66', 38, 6, 17, 67572) You may go on asking me any questions that you like.
('66', 38, 6, 18, 67625) I will reply to as many of them as I can when I get time.
('66', 38, 6, 19, 67683) How is Kisan?
('66', 38, 6, 20, 67697) She was to come and stay with you for some time.
('66', 38, 6, 21, 67746) What happened about that?
('66', 38, 6, 22, 67772) I am sure your work will go on and you will receive monetary help as and when needed.
('66', 38, 6, 23, 67858) Since you have unshakable faith in the power of Ramanama, you will certainly experience the truth of your faith.
('66', 38, 6, 24, 67971) Go on repeating it even if you see darkness all around.
('66', 38, 6, 25, 68027) If you do that, all will be well with you.
('66', 38, 6, 26, 68070) The small size of land holdings is a big problem.
('66', 38, 6, 27, 68120) It will present difficulties even when we have power in our hands.
('66', 38, 6, 28, 68187) Just now our experiments are intended to find out what we can do without power.
('66', 38, 6, 29, 68267) Even small plots can be profitable if they are cultivated intelligently.
('66', 38, 6, 30, 68340) We can demonstrate this only through experiments.
('66', 38, 6, 31, 68390) But our own superficial knowledge in this field is a handicap.
('66', 38, 6, 32, 68453) That is why we do not take up directly problems relating to agriculture.
('66', 38, 6, 33, 68526) Our present aim is to popularize such crafts and industries as we can think of and aswould be easy for the villagers to learn, so that we may teach cultiva tors to shed their lethargy and may also promote the application of intelligence to crafts.
('66', 38, 6, 34, 68774) The rest will follow.
('66', 38, 6, 35, 68796) I am certain that the people’s condition was better formerly than
('66', 39, 0, 1, 68862) 40 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 39, 1, 2, 68903) it is today.
('66', 39, 1, 3, 68916) This can be proved.
('66', 39, 1, 4, 68936) In the past, the country drew wealth from outside.
('66', 39, 1, 5, 68987) Land holdings had not become fragmented to the extent that they have today, and wealth was not drained out of the country as it is today.
('66', 39, 1, 6, 69125) Nature did her work in her own way.
('66', 39, 1, 7, 69161) Now we interfere with her work without full knowledge of her laws, and we do this in an organized manner.
('66', 39, 1, 8, 69267) The result is that we are completely impoverished.
('66', 39, 1, 9, 69318) Ramarajya is certainly an imaginary ideal, but it can also be proved that something approximating to it did exist in former times.
('66', 39, 1, 10, 69449) It is true, however, that at no time in the past were untruth and poverty completely absent and they are not likely to be so at any time in the future.
('66', 39, 1, 11, 69601) The practice of retiring into mountain caves was undoubtedly inspired by despair about the world.
('66', 39, 1, 12, 69699) It may have had some use in the past, but it has none today.
('66', 39, 1, 13, 69760) To give one’s life in the service of one’s fellow beings is as good a thing as living in a cave.
('66', 39, 1, 14, 69857) Our attitude towards other people should be the same as towards ourselves.
('66', 39, 1, 15, 69932) Though we may remain unattached to things concerning ourselves, we shall certainly feel cold and heat and try to relieve cold with heat and heat with cold.
('66', 39, 1, 16, 70088) If we don’t succeed, however, we shall not sit down and start crying.
('66', 39, 1, 17, 70158) That is non attachment.
('66', 39, 1, 18, 70182) Our attitude to others shivering with cold should be the same.
('66', 39, 1, 19, 70245) We must try to relieve their suffering.
('66', 39, 1, 20, 70285) Seeing them shivering, we will give them or share with them what we have.
('66', 39, 1, 21, 70359) If they still continue to shiver, we will suffer with them but will not lose our patience and resort to violence or untruth.
('66', 39, 1, 22, 70484) That will be non attachment on our part.
('66', 39, 1, 23, 70525) Khadi both is and is not a means of livelihood.
('66', 39, 1, 24, 70573) It has been described as Annapurna 1. Excepting violence, I think there are many things in Russia which seem worth accepting.
('66', 39, 1, 25, 70699) It is possible, however, that the changes which now seem realizable only through force will not be accepted by people voluntarily in the very same form.
('66', 39, 1, 26, 70852) But, then, it is not right to draw inferences, as all of us do, from what we read.
('66', 39, 1, 27, 70935) We should think about our problems independently for ourselves.
('66', 39, 1, 28, 70999) The person who is affected by a problem can solve it best.
('66', 39, 1, 29, 71058) It is impossible to eliminate inequality completely.
('66', 39, 1, 30, 71111) But we can bring about the maximum measure of equality only by following

('66', 40, 1, 2, 71286) the path which I have shown.
('66', 40, 1, 3, 71315) It is not a new truth I am holding up before the country but an old one (though perhaps in a new manner).
('66', 40, 1, 4, 71421) Cultivators can derive great hope from the fact that, by engaging themselves in subsidiary industries in their spare time, they can add considerably to their income.
('66', 40, 1, 5, 71587) The economic interests of cultivators should be safeguarded through proper organization.
('66', 40, 1, 6, 71676) We can explain to them that economic betterment will not be possible unless they learn to organize.
('66', 40, 1, 7, 71776) The law of karma is easy to understand.
('66', 40, 1, 8, 71816) It is similar to the law which we learn in mechanics.
('66', 40, 1, 9, 71870) When several material forces operate simultaneously, we see only one result of their operation.
('66', 40, 1, 10, 71966) That is also how karma operates.
('66', 40, 1, 11, 71999) You may, if you wish, go to a very small village.
('66', 40, 1, 12, 72049) But it will be enough if you stick to the present place.
('66', 40, 1, 13, 72106) If you can achieve complete success in one place, it will have the same effect that a right angle has.
('66', 40, 2, 14, 72209) At present we have no right angle.

('66', 40, 6, 21, 72514) Have you kept up any study there?
('66', 40, 6, 22, 72548) If you become lethargic, you will not be able to run your home when you have one.
('66', 40, 6, 23, 72630) Do not, therefore, remain idle a single minute.
('66', 40, 6, 24, 72678) You should spend some time in good reading and some in doing useful work.

('66', 42, 2, 3, 74437) DELHI, January 1, 1935
('66', 42, 3, 4, 74460) It is true that I enjoy friendly relations with General Smuts.
('66', 42, 3, 5, 74523) 1 We even met in London during the Second Round Table Conference and had discussions about India’s goal.
('66', 42, 3, 6, 74628) It is true also that he had advised acceptance of the proposals adumbrated in the White Paper, as distinguished from the J. P. C. Report.
('66', 42, 3, 7, 74766) General Smuts had given that advice with certain reservations.
('66', 42, 3, 8, 74829) I might state that to General Smuts’s letter I had sent no reply.
('66', 42, 3, 9, 74895) His was an informal private letter calling for no reply.
('66', 42, 3, 10, 74952) I would advise the public not to attach any importance to a matter of purely personal concern, carrying no public significance, especially when my opinion 2 on the White Paper proposals remains unchanged.
('66', 42, 4, 11, 75157) On his attention being drawn to recent newspaper reports suggesting that Mr. Andrews’s recent visit to India was in connection with the J. P. C. Report, Gandhiji emphatically stated that it had nothing to do with the Report, nor was Mr. Andrews the bearer of any letter from General Smuts.
('66', 42, 4, 12, 75447) His visit was predominantly in connection with his forthcoming broadcast this month.
('66', 42, 4, 13, 75532) So far as the J.P.C. Report is concerned, we had the briefest casual conversation, not extending over a few minutes, during which I gathered that Mr. C. F. Andrews was in substantial agreement with my opinion that the proposals are utterly unaccep table.

('66', 43, 2, 3, 76211) DELHI, January 2, 1935
('66', 43, 3, 4, 76234) MANILAL AND SUSHILA, I got your letters as also the cable regarding Ramdas and Nimu.
('66', 43, 3, 5, 76319) I wanted something like this, but I had not asked for a cable.
('66', 43, 3, 6, 76382) It is difficult to say if Ramdas will go [to South Africa].
('66', 43, 3, 7, 76442) At present he is looking for an opening in some business in Bombay.
('66', 43, 3, 8, 76510) Anyway Manilal has, though belatedly, discharged his obligation.
('66', 43, 3, 9, 76575) Harilal has for some time now settled in Rajkot.
('66', 43, 3, 10, 76624) He seems to have undergone a metamorphosis.
('66', 43, 3, 11, 76668) I have noted what Sushila writes about Sita.
('66', 43, 3, 12, 76713) It will be enough if she is educated as you four brothers were educated by me.
('66', 43, 3, 13, 76792) I don’t repent it.
('66', 43, 3, 14, 76811) It does not matter that they had no formal schooling.
('66', 43, 3, 15, 76865) They have lost nothing thereby.
('66', 43, 3, 16, 76897) Harilal was stubborn and did eventually go to school, doing himself harm.
('66', 43, 3, 17, 76971) What children get in the loving company of their parents they can get nowhere else.
('66', 43, 3, 18, 77055) Sita need not be sent here.
('66', 43, 3, 19, 77083) Know that you have a duty towards Sita as you have your other duties.
('66', 43, 3, 20, 77153) When you try to discharge this duty you will learn the lesson of pure brahmacharya.
('66', 43, 3, 21, 77237) Just by her trying to pick up your calling she will train herself.
('66', 43, 3, 22, 77304) She will pick up your speech whether decent or indecent.
('66', 43, 3, 23, 77361) If you know your grammar she will learn it.
('66', 43, 3, 24, 77405) If you can keep your accounts, she will learn her arithmetic.
('66', 43, 3, 25, 77467) She will dust, cook, fetch water, tend the plants, learn press work.
('66', 43, 3, 26, 77536) In this way by learning yourselves and helping others learn, you will all rise higher and higher.
('66', 43, 3, 27, 77634) When she grows up you can send her elsewhere where she can learn more.
('66', 43, 3, 28, 77705) This is the purport of the varnashrama dharma and there is economics underlying it.
('66', 43, 3, 29, 77789) This is true education.
('66', 43, 3, 30, 77813) Give up your fondness for schools.
('66', 43, 3, 31, 77848) It is my firm belief that although the schools may offer you a free play for the intellect they do little towards character building.
('66', 43, 3, 32, 77982) I myself know many who have suffered in character by going to school.
('66', 43, 3, 33, 78052) I do not know of many people who could add luster to their character by attending schools.
('66', 43, 3, 34, 78143) I for one believe that those parents who send their children to school do not observe their dharma.
('66', 43, 3, 35, 78243) Yes, when the children grow up, that is, say, attain the age of sixteen, they can do whatever they like.
('66', 43, 3, 36, 78348) Hence, let Sitaremain under your personal care till she is sixteen so that she turns

('66', 44, 1, 2, 78478) out an accomplished girl and may not suffer any kind of handicap.
('66', 44, 1, 3, 78544) To achieve this she should participate in all your activities and play her part intelligently.
('66', 44, 1, 4, 78639) With this you will have observed your dharma.
('66', 44, 1, 5, 78685) The purport of all that I have said is only this: Forget for the time being your obsession with schooling for Sita.
('66', 44, 1, 6, 78801) Let her have as much English, Hindi, Gujarati as you two can give her.
('66', 44, 1, 7, 78872) Teach her your calling.
('66', 44, 1, 8, 78896) You can impart to her plenty of knowledge through everyday conversation.
('66', 44, 1, 9, 78969) In this way she will be making rapid progress.
('66', 44, 1, 10, 79016) The right thing for her is to stick right there.
('66', 44, 1, 11, 79065) Teach her the prayers, bhajans, etc.
('66', 44, 1, 12, 79102) She should learn the Ramayana and other stories.
('66', 44, 1, 13, 79151) Let her know about the Gita and other books.
('66', 44, 1, 14, 79196) Some books you and Sushila have to read just for Sita’s sake.
('66', 44, 1, 15, 79258) None of you need think of the country for the time being.
('66', 44, 1, 16, 79316) When you come you should all come together.
('66', 44, 1, 17, 79360) Having thought over all this “do as you like” 1.

('66', 44, 7, 23, 79524) I have your letter.
('66', 44, 7, 24, 79544) Certainly I am responsible 2 but I had understood that you had nothing to hide.
('66', 44, 7, 25, 79624) Do not read the letters that you get or don’t let them affect you.

('66', 45, 1, 2, 80073) 64. DISCUSSION AT CENTRAL BOARD, HARIJAN SEVAK SANGH 1
('66', 45, 2, 3, 80128) [January 2, 1935] 2
('66', 45, 3, 4, 80148) ‘Why’, some of them asked, ‘should this be put into a pledge?’ 3 And this pledge seems more sociological than humanitarian.
('66', 45, 3, 5, 80272) Eradication of untouchability is one thing, but this levelling of status seems to be altogether a different thing.
('66', 45, 3, 6, 80387) Are we to regard our servants as equal to us in status?
('66', 45, 3, 7, 80443) You seem to be driving us slowly to social and economic revolution.
('66', 45, 3, 8, 80511) [GANDHIJI:] I am surprised that the truth dawns upon you so late.
('66', 45, 3, 9, 80577) You are very much mistaken if you feel that Harijans expect anything less from you.
('66', 45, 3, 10, 80661) You may be quite ready to treat a few Harijans on terms of equality, but unless you are prepared to treat all—the sweeper and the scavenger—and not merely a Harijan Judge sitting on a Court Bench—you have not rid yourselves of the evil.
('66', 45, 3, 11, 80898) The very idea of superiority is most loathsome.
('66', 45, 3, 12, 80946) It is at the back of most of the race feuds in the world.
('66', 45, 3, 13, 81004) The thing is universal, I am afraid, but among us, it is in its cruellest form, because it is claimed to have got a religious sanction.
('66', 45, 4, 14, 81140) ‘You are right, Mahatmaji,’ said one of the members, ‘there are some members on our Board who feel that Brahmins are superior to Vaishyas.’ [G.] They have no business to be on our Board.
('66', 45, 4, 15, 81327) Removal of untouchability means one thing for a Harijan, another thing for a caste Hindu, and quite another for a Harijan Sevak.
('66', 45, 5, 16, 81456) ‘I quite see the thing,’ said Shrimati Rameshwari Nehru, ‘but how can I sign the pledge when I know that I do not treat my servant as equal to me in status?
('66', 45, 5, 17, 81613) My peace of mind will go.’ [G.] It need not go.
('66', 45, 5, 18, 81661) You will treat him as a member of your family.
('66', 45, 6, 19, 81708) [R. N.] It is easier said than done, Mahatmaji.
('66', 45, 6, 20, 81756) How can I claim to treat him as a member of my family when I sleep on a cot or a sofa, and he stands at the door?
('66', 45, 7, 21, 81870) [G.] You can, for the simple reason that you will sleep on your feather bed, not because you are superior to him, but because it has become a need with you.
('66', 45, 7, 22, 82027) No, no.
('66', 45, 7, 23, 82035) You are unnecessarily afraid.
('66', 45, 7, 24, 82065) It is more a mental adjustment than physical.
('66', 45, 7, 25, 82111) I shall give you just one or
('66', 45, 8, 26, 82140) 1 Extracted from Mahadev Desai’s “Self introspection week”
('66', 45, 9, 27, 82199) 2 The pledge which was a part of the constitution was discussed and adopted on January 2.
('66', 45, 10, 28, 82289) 3 It read: “I do not consider any human being as inferior to me in status and I shall strive my utmost to live up to that belief.”

('66', 46, 1, 2, 82465) two instances.
('66', 46, 1, 3, 82480) When I went to Lady Astor’s, she brought out all her servants to shake hands with me.
('66', 46, 1, 4, 82566) They hesitated, but then they saw that they did not need to do so.
('66', 46, 1, 5, 82633) Lloyd George, when I was his guest for a few hours, encouraged all his servants, as he would his own children, to hand me their autograph books for my signature.
('66', 46, 2, 6, 82795) [R. N.] I know, Mahatmaji, I know.
('66', 46, 2, 7, 82830) Bertrand Russell also treats his servants as equals.
('66', 46, 2, 8, 82883) [G.] Well, then, why should you be any less than Bertrand Russell?
('66', 46, 2, 9, 82950) You have a father who will place no obstacles in your way and a husband who will go the whole length with you.
('66', 46, 2, 10, 83061) No, no.
('66', 46, 2, 11, 83069) This pledge is absolutely essential.
('66', 46, 2, 12, 83106) You cut at the root of the movement if you do not have it, and you will justify the attitude of the sanatanists.
('66', 46, 2, 13, 83219) As you have to discharge the financial obligations, you have to discharge the moral also, and I must say that, just as I should rue the day on which I collected money if I found that the money was ill spent, in the same way I should feel guilty if I found that I was not discharging the moral obligation.
('66', 46, 2, 14, 83524) You ought to have realized the implications of the movement when you joined it.
('66', 46, 2, 15, 83604) I am not after extinguishing all differences.
('66', 46, 2, 16, 83650) Who can destroy natural differences?
('66', 46, 2, 17, 83687) Is there no difference between a Brahmin, a dog and a dog eater?
('66', 46, 2, 18, 83752) And yet the Gita says:
('66', 46, 3, 19, 83775) i.e., ‘The men who have realized the Truth look with an equal eye on a learned and cultured Brahmin, on a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog eater.’ There is a difference between them but the man who knows the science of life will say that there is no difference between them in status, as there is none between an elephant and an ant, a savage and a savant.
('66', 46, 3, 20, 84133) Of course, the savage may be awe struck before a savant; but the latter should not have any sense of superiority.
('66', 46, 3, 21, 84247) No, we are all equal in the eyes of the law and God.
('66', 46, 3, 22, 84300) That is the ideal we have to live up to.
('66', 46, 4, 23, 84341) But, then, there should be no master, no servant?
('66', 46, 4, 24, 84391) There is a beautiful Latin saying—Primus inter pares— first among equals, and the Master or the President will be the first among equals.
('66', 46, 4, 25, 84529) I can see that it is difficult to practise the thing; that is why you will say in your pledge that you will strive your utmost to live up to your belief.
('66', 46, 4, 26, 84683) That we cannot practise it at once, or fully, does not show that the pledge is wrong; it shows that human nature can be despicable.
('66', 46, 4, 27, 84815) No, you have got to understand that this is a fundamental
('66', 47, 0, 1, 84873) 48 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 47, 1, 2, 84914) thing of the movement.
('66', 47, 1, 3, 84937) Otherwise, you will justify the charge that it is a dodge.

('66', 47, 4, 6, 85054) January 2, 1935
('66', 47, 5, 7, 85070) The whole idea originated with Sjt.
('66', 47, 5, 8, 85106) Ghanshyamdas Birla, and he had now donated the grounds for the Colony.
('66', 47, 5, 9, 85177) As President of the Board and as a moneyed man, he was always thinking of ways and means for the economic uplift of the Harijans, and his ambition was to make this Colony a centre from which would radiate inspiration and all kinds of activity.
('66', 47, 5, 10, 85421) However, it is no use talking of one’s ambition.
('66', 47, 5, 11, 85470) Everything will depend on us, workers.
('66', 47, 5, 12, 85509) No work will suffer for want of money, that much I can say, from my own experience of several institutions.
('66', 47, 5, 13, 85617) Remember that we are debtors and Harijans are creditors.
('66', 47, 5, 14, 85674) We have until today delighted in mounting on their backs, like ‘the old man of the sea’.
('66', 47, 5, 15, 85763) We have exacted labour from them and have not scrupled to belabour them, and even to kill them, when they raised a voice of protest.
('66', 47, 5, 16, 85896) A Meerut zamindar is said to have seriously injured [some Harijans] and one has died.
('66', 47, 5, 17, 85982) In Kathiawar, a similar thing happened, and there, too a Harijan died.
('66', 47, 5, 18, 86053) The poor folks would seem to have been born in order to toil and moil for us!
('66', 47, 5, 19, 86131) We have been guilty of a heinous sin, and it is time we expiated it.
('66', 47, 5, 20, 86200) It is for that purpose that the Sangh was created.
('66', 47, 5, 21, 86251) It is a stupendous task, but it has to be done.
('66', 47, 5, 22, 86299) I have said it several times, and shall repeat it today, that, unless we discharge our debt, Hinduism will perish.
('66', 47, 5, 23, 86414) Untouchability must be destroyed, or else it will destroy Hinduism.
('66', 47, 5, 24, 86482) That is why I am giving myself no rest.
('66', 47, 5, 25, 86522) Not that I do not need it.
('66', 47, 5, 26, 86549) I may say that I have several years of arrears of rest to cover, but how can I have rest?
('66', 47, 5, 27, 86639) How can one have rest with a raging fire within?
('66', 47, 5, 28, 86688) How can any Hindu, knowing that Hinduism is on the brink Of an active volcano, afford to have a moment’s rest?
('66', 47, 5, 29, 86799) Not, surely, until the volcano is extinguished.
('66', 47, 5, 30, 86847) In a stupendous task of this character, a gift of Rs. 3,500, like the one given by Ghanshyamdasji today, is as a drop in the ocean.
('66', 47, 5, 31, 86979) Hundreds of millionaires like him will have to empty their treasures for this sacred task.
('66', 47, 5, 32, 87070) If only you are consumed with a passion for it, the task will be done.
('66', 47, 5, 33, 87141) There is no lack of money, as Ghanshyamdasji said.
('66', 47, 5, 34, 87192) There will be none.
('66', 47, 5, 35, 87212) All that is needed is the will and passion for it.
('66', 47, 5, 36, 87263) The service of the Harijans is the service of Hinduism, and the service of Hinduism is the service of humanity.
('66', 47, 5, 37, 87375) Hinduism is no exclusive religion, it tolerates no

('66', 48, 1, 2, 87534) intolerance.
('66', 48, 1, 3, 87547) Intolerance it holds to be a sin.
('66', 48, 1, 4, 87581) But unless and until we befriend the Harijan, unless and until we treat him as our own brother, we cannot treat humanity as one brotherhood.
('66', 48, 1, 5, 87722) The whole movement for the removal of untouchability is a movement for the establishment of universal brotherhood, and nothing less.

('66', 48, 8, 15, 88216) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter of 21st ultimo.
('66', 48, 8, 16, 88273) Your previous letter was read by Mirabehn, Mahadev and later by Andrews.
('66', 48, 8, 17, 88346) All of them puts independently of me, the same construction that I had.
('66', 48, 8, 18, 88418) Of course, I unreservedly accept your correction.
('66', 48, 8, 19, 88468) I simply want to say that it was after carefully reading your letter more than three times that I sent you the reply 2 I did.
('66', 48, 8, 20, 88594) Andrews also read my reply to you, and he hadnothing to suggest by way of alteration.
('66', 48, 8, 21, 88680) Of course, you knew the existence of the repressive laws.
('66', 48, 8, 22, 88738) But you did not know, nor do you know now, what their continuance meant or means to us here.
('66', 48, 8, 23, 88831) A strange confirmation of this comes from Dr. Maude Royden who is reported to have said at Karachi that the people in England knew nothing, through the daily Press or otherwise, of the amazing things which she heard during the two or three days she found herself amongst the very sober women of India.
('66', 48, 8, 24, 89133) Andrews will be able to give you first hand testimony of what he saw and learnt in Bengal.
('66', 48, 8, 25, 89224) You seem to regard the possibility of withdrawal of the

('66', 49, 0, 1, 89367) 50 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 49, 1, 2, 89408) forthcoming Bill 1 as a calamity.
('66', 49, 1, 3, 89442) In my opinion, if the withdrawal comes even at the last moment, it will be a blessing both for England and India, for the simple reason that persistence in the measure in the face of an almost unanimous Indian opposition to it would mean an unbending attitude on the part of the British Parliament and utter contempt for Indian public opinion.
('66', 49, 1, 4, 89786) I hope you have seen the bitter comment made by Rt.
('66', 49, 1, 5, 89838) Sastri, who was at one time a persona grata at the India Office whose complete confidence he enjoyed, and the equally bitter comment of Hon.
('66', 49, 1, 6, 89979) C. Y. Chintamani, who has been regarded as a moderate among moderates and who has, in season and out of season, condemned the Congress attitude in unmeasured language.
('66', 49, 1, 7, 90147) Now for the briefest summary of my own personal objections to the J. P. C. Report.
('66', 49, 1, 8, 90230) I read that Report and the White Paper as one document.
('66', 49, 1, 9, 90286) Whatever new there is in the former is not regarded at this end as an improvement, but quite the contrary, and it is the last straw which has broken the back of the Liberals.
('66', 49, 1, 10, 90461) They had cherished the fond hope that the Joint Memorandum signed under the leadership of the Aga Khan would receive the favourable consideration of the Joint Parliamentary Committee and that some, if not all, of its recommenda tions would be accepted by it.
('66', 49, 1, 11, 90720) The contemptuous dismissal of that Memorandum, beyond a mere courteous reference to it, has extorted the following remark from Sastri:
('66', 49, 2, 12, 90855) No, Sir, it is impossible for the Liberal Party to give an atom of co operation.
('66', 49, 2, 13, 90936) Co operation with friends that wish well of us will be worth while, but co operation with those who have displayed the utmost distrust ofus, who do not care for our views and demands, and who enact a constitution in utter disregard of our wishes, what is co operation with them, I ask?
('66', 49, 2, 14, 91222) I should call it a suicide.
('66', 49, 3, 15, 91250) SUMMARY
('66', 49, 4, 16, 91258) 1. There is no suggestion in the J. P. C. Report that there should be a clause in the constitution providing for automatic advance to complete independence or whatever the elected representatives of India may decide to have.
('66', 49, 4, 17, 91483) 2. The contemplated constitution saddles India with a greater financial burden than she is bearing today without any prospect of economic or political betterment.
('66', 49, 5, 18, 91646) 1 The Government of India Bill on a new constitution for India.
('66', 49, 5, 19, 91710) It received Royal assent and became an Act on August 2, 1935.
('66', 50, 0, 1, 91772) VOL.66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 51
('66', 50, 1, 2, 91817) 3. At the centre, 80 per cent of the revenue is reserved out of any popular control.
('66', 50, 1, 3, 91902) 4. There is no popular control over the military, whether as to policy or as to expenditure.
('66', 50, 1, 4, 91995) 5. There is no popular control over the currency or the exchange of the country.
('66', 50, 1, 5, 92076) 6. Even the control over the 20 per cent proposed to be left in the hands of the Finance Minister is subject to suspension by the Governor General.
('66', 50, 1, 6, 92224) 7. The provincial autonomy adumbrated in the Report is purely nominal, as the Governors of the provinces have such wide powers that they can, whenever they choose, make an end of responsibility.
('66', 50, 1, 7, 92419) It would be utterly wrong for any Britisher to infer from Colonial precedents that these powers will be rarely, if ever, exercised.
('66', 50, 1, 8, 92551) Indian past experience is quite the contrary.
('66', 50, 1, 9, 92597) 8. Responsible Ministers have no right even to transfer any member, either of the all India service or of the provincial service.
('66', 50, 1, 10, 92727) 9. The so called autonomous legislatures will have no right to amend the Police Acts or even Police Regulations.
('66', 50, 1, 11, 92840) 10. British exploitation is made firmer than ever.
('66', 50, 1, 12, 92891) The overwhelming effect of all the foregoing objections consi dered together leaves an indelible impression upon the mind that, bad as the existing constitution is, the threatened new one will be infinitely worse.
('66', 50, 1, 13, 93105) And what is more, if the threatened new constitution is passed, it would be most difficult for years to come to undo the mischief that will be done under it.
('66', 50, 1, 14, 93263) To clinch the whole of the objections, it is well to remember that the constitution is sought to be imposed upon the people who are already groaning under repression, such as, perhaps, has not been equalled in British Indian history.
('66', 50, 1, 15, 93497) I am making this statement with the full sense of my responsibility.
('66', 50, 1, 16, 93566) I have a vivid memory of Jallianwala Bagh.
('66', 50, 1, 17, 93609) I have read Kaye and Malleson’s volumes on the Sepoy Revolt, as it has been called, of 1857. Both make gruesome reading.
('66', 50, 1, 18, 93730) Then, it was the naked sword.
('66', 50, 1, 19, 93760) The repression represents the gloved fist, but deadlier on that account.
('66', 50, 1, 20, 93833) You may make whatever private use you wish of this letter.
('66', 50, 1, 21, 93892) Nobody else is responsible for the opinion I have expressed in this.
('66', 50, 1, 22, 93961) It has been shown to no friend beyond Mahadev, Mira and the typist.
('66', 50, 1, 23, 94029) My writing may seem bitter; but I would like to warn you against putting any such interpretation upon it.
('66', 50, 1, 24, 94135) The language
('66', 51, 0, 1, 94148) 52 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 51, 1, 2, 94189) represents the truth and nothing but the truth as I have seen and felt it.
('66', 51, 1, 3, 94264) It does not represent the whole truth.
('66', 51, 1, 4, 94303) If I had the time and the capacity to give you the whole truth, the version would be even worse than it is.
('66', 51, 1, 5, 94411) In spite, however, of the black picture that I see in it, I have no bitterness in me against a single Englishman.
('66', 51, 1, 6, 94525) I believe that the English Ministers are pursuing what they believe to be an honest policy to be adopted in the interest of India.
('66', 51, 1, 7, 94656) It is their honest belief that British rule in India has been, on the whole, for her good.
('66', 51, 1, 8, 94747) They honestly believe that under it India has advanced in economic progress and in political capacity, and that if India received the constitution that the vast number of the intelligentsia wish for, it would be a bad day for her.
('66', 51, 1, 9, 94978) It is difficult to combat an honest belief, however erroneous it may be, as, in my opinion, it is in this case.
('66', 51, 1, 10, 95090) But it would also be wrong to be angry over an honest belief of any person.
('66', 51, 1, 11, 95166) Whilst, therefore, I hold the strong opinion that I have expressed in the foregoing summary I would ask you to believe me implicitly when I give you my assurance that, God helping, I shall take no step in haste or in anger.
('66', 51, 1, 12, 95390) I have retired from the Congress because, among other reasons, I want to impose silence upon myself, so far as it is humanly possible, about the political measures of the Government.
('66', 51, 1, 13, 95573) I want, in my volun tary isolation, to explore the yet hidden possibilities of non violence.
('66', 51, 1, 14, 95666) Every action I am taking, no matter in what department of life, is being taken with that end in view.
('66', 51, 1, 15, 95768) The only axe that I have to grind on this earth is to try to understand the ultimate truth of things which, at present, I seem to see only dimly.
('66', 51, 1, 16, 95914) And after a laborious search I have come to the conclusion that if I am to see it in any fullness I can only do so by non violence in thought, word and deed.
('66', 51, 1, 17, 96072) What this search will lead me to, I really do not know myself, nor have I the slightest desire to see it before its time.
('66', 51, 1, 18, 96194) For me, therefore, it is an incessant waiting upon God to show me the next step, and I shall be grateful if any of you friends can, with your full hearts, help me in that search.

('66', 52, 7, 10, 96865) A happy New Year to you all.
('66', 52, 7, 11, 96894) Your letter reached me just in time to enable me to send you this little note.
('66', 52, 7, 12, 96973) I often think of you and my Oxford visits but the work in hand crowds out all love letters.
('66', 52, 7, 13, 97065) We have very difficult times here in every way.
('66', 52, 7, 14, 97113) But I don’t lose hope.
('66', 52, 7, 15, 97136) I know that winter must be followed by summer.
('66', 52, 7, 16, 97183) It is loving thought to regard one’s cats and dogs as members of one’s family.
('66', 52, 7, 17, 97262) You know that Andrews was in our midst for a few days.
('66', 52, 7, 18, 97317) He expects to return in April.
('66', 52, 7, 19, 97348) Dr. Maude Royden is in Karachi.
('66', 52, 7, 20, 97380) I expect to see her in Delhi where I am just now and where I expect to be for over three weeks.
('66', 52, 7, 21, 97476) Mira, Mahadev and Devdas are here.
('66', 52, 7, 22, 97511) Pyarelal is away near Bombay.

('66', 53, 2, 3, 97938) January 3, 1935 In Mr. Abhyankar, a brave and intrepid man has passed away.
('66', 53, 2, 4, 98014) His death is a distinct loss to the nation.
('66', 53, 2, 5, 98058) My own relations with him were growing day by day so intimate that his passing away I feel like a personal loss.

('66', 53, 5, 8, 98211) A CORRECTION
('66', 53, 6, 9, 98224) In reference to the figures of production and sale given by the Secretary, A.I.S.A., in the self sufficiency report published in our issue of the 9th November, he writes: 1
('66', 53, 7, 10, 98397) In Harijan dated 9 11 34, on page 312, figures of khadi production and sale of A.I.S.A. branches have appeared.
('66', 53, 7, 11, 98509) Therein, with reference to Karnatak and Utkal Branches, it has been stated in the footnote that ‘the production of the branches being inadequate, khadi had to be imported from [other] branches to meet the demand’.
('66', 53, 7, 12, 98723) This remark does not apply to Utkal.
('66', 53, 7, 13, 98760) The purchases of the Utkal Branch from other branches during 1933 amounted to only Rs. 557, and not over Rs. 17,000 as would appear from the remark made.
('66', 53, 7, 14, 98914) We regret the error.
('66', 53, 8, 15, 98935) HARIJAN REPRESENTATION
('66', 53, 9, 16, 98958) At the request of a correspondent, I had asked Thakkar Bapa to tell me how many Harijans there were in Harijan Sevak Boards in all India.
('66', 53, 9, 17, 99096) The returns so far received show, for ten provinces, 171 Harijan members against 1,158 non Harijans.
('66', 53, 9, 18, 99197) I give the figures by way of information only.
('66', 53, 9, 19, 99244) It would be wrong to infer that these figures are a sign of solid work.
('66', 53, 9, 20, 99316) They are undoubtedly evidence of two things: (1) The Boards have tried to take as their co members as many Harijans as they could find to help them.
('66', 53, 9, 21, 99465) (2) There are enough Hindus of standing who are prepared to lend their names to the Boards, whose avowed object is to seek forHarijans equality with the rest of their fellow Hindus in matters social, economical, political and religious.
('66', 53, 9, 22, 99702) I wish it were possible for me to add also that the number of so

('66', 54, 1, 2, 99850) many caste Hindus and Harijan Hindus on the Boards is a sign of solid progress.
('66', 54, 1, 3, 99930) Indeed, the large number of members on the Boards adds to the expenses of administration without increasing efficiency or the output of work.
('66', 54, 1, 4, 100072) Means are being devised to increase efficiency and output, even if it should involve reduction of the number of members.
('66', 54, 1, 5, 100193) In the service of the poor and the down trodden, limitation of overhead expenses to a minimum is absolutely necessary.
('66', 54, 1, 6, 100312) For the helpless can exercise no check on the extravagance, be it unconscious, of their helpers, no matter how benevolent, and the latter, unless they would put checks on their unconscious extravagance in the name of better management, are likely to spend more than they need.
('66', 54, 1, 7, 100589) A critical examination of the administration of many charitable organizations would either reveal woeful extravagance or hopeless mismanagement and a criminal neglect of their trust by the trustees.
('66', 54, 1, 8, 100788) Harijan Boards have to escape both misfortunes, if they are to render a good account of themselves to the Harijans, whom it is their sole aim to serve.

('66', 55, 3, 5, 101681) 72. ITS MEANING
('66', 55, 4, 6, 101697) To my unaided mind you appear to be opening the first campaign of an endless and quixotic war against modern civilization.
('66', 55, 4, 7, 101820) Long ago you proclaimed yourself its sleepless enemy, and now you would, if you could, turn it back on the course it has pursued for some millennia.
('66', 55, 4, 8, 101969) I reel at the mere thought.
('66', 55, 5, 9, 101997) This is from an intimate letter from a dear friend who wrote in reply to my letter, inquiring if he could extend his co operation in the effort.
('66', 55, 5, 10, 102142) As the view expressed so frankly by the friend is, I know, shared by quite a number of friends, it is well for me to explain my position.
('66', 55, 5, 11, 102280) It would be impertinent for me to do so if my position was not also that of the A.I.V.I.A. In seeking to revive such village industries as are capable of being revived, I am making no such attempt as the friend ascribes to me.
('66', 55, 5, 12, 102507) I am trying to do what every lover of village life, everyone who realizes the tragic meaning of the disintegration of villages, is doing or trying to do.
('66', 55, 5, 13, 102661) Why am I turning back the course of modern civilization when I ask the villager to grind his own meal, eat it whole, including the nourishing bran, or when I ask him to turn his sugar cane into gur for his own requirements, if not for sale?
('66', 55, 5, 14, 102902) Am I turning back the course of modern civilization when I ask the villagers not merely to grow raw produce, but to turn it into marketable products and thereby add a few more pies to their daily income?
('66', 55, 5, 15, 103106) And surely modern civilization is not millennia old.
('66', 55, 5, 16, 103159) We can almost give its birth an exact date.
('66', 55, 5, 17, 103203) If I could do it, I would most assuredly destroy or radically change much that goes under the name of modern civilization.
('66', 55, 5, 18, 103326) But that is an old story of life.
('66', 55, 5, 19, 103360) The attempt is undoubtedly there.
('66', 55, 5, 20, 103394) Its success depends upon God.
('66', 55, 5, 21, 103424) But the attempt to revive and encourage the remunerative village industries is not part ofsuch an attempt, except in so far as every one of my activities, including the propagation of non violence, can be described as such

('66', 56, 1, 2, 103758) an attempt.
('66', 56, 1, 3, 103770) The revival of village industries is but an extension of the khadi effort.
('66', 56, 1, 4, 103845) Hand spun cloth, hand made paper, hand pounded rice, home made bread and jam, are not uncommon in the West.
('66', 56, 1, 5, 103953) Only, there they do not have one hundredth of the importance they have in India.
('66', 56, 1, 6, 104034) For, with us, their revival means life, their destruction means death, to the villagers, as he who runs may see.
('66', 56, 1, 7, 104147) Whatever the machine age may do, it will never give employment to the millions whom the wholesale introduction of power machinery must displace.

('66', 56, 6, 25, 104876) You will know from Harijan the activities here.
('66', 56, 6, 26, 104924) If any Harijan workers can take up other work besides khadi and arrange it round the latter like the planets revolving round the sun, there could be no objection at all to their doing so.
('66', 56, 6, 27, 105112) On the contrary, it is desirable.
('66', 56, 6, 28, 105146) If you have grasped this principle, follow it.

('66', 57, 9, 23, 106589) As the mentality of the people has changed today towards khadi, so I hope to turn their mind in favour of indigenous industries.

('66', 58, 7, 9, 107788) DELHI, January 5, 1935
('66', 58, 8, 10, 107811) MY DEAR CHILD,
('66', 58, 9, 11, 107826) If this letter can intensify the wishes, then this is to reciprocate your wishes.
('66', 58, 9, 12, 107908) It is freezingly cold here.
('66', 58, 9, 13, 107936) The 4 o’clock prayer bell has gone.
('66', 58, 9, 14, 107972) Of course, Harijans need ever so much more than mere temple entry for their spiritual satisfaction.
('66', 58, 9, 15, 108072) Temple entry is not so much their spiritual need, as its grant is that of the arrogant caste Hindus.
('66', 58, 9, 16, 108173) They can have no spiritual grace so long as they deny to their fellows in faith the same right of worship that they claim for themselves.
('66', 58, 9, 17, 108311) Is not this quite clear?
('66', 58, 9, 18, 108336) With love and kisses added for the children,
('66', 58, 10, 19, 108381) Yours, BAPU [PS ] In Delhi till 20th at least, 28th at the most.

('66', 59, 1, 2, 108827) 78. SPEECH AT MEETING OF CENTRAL BOARD, HARIJAN SEVAK SANGH 1
('66', 59, 2, 3, 108889) [January 5, 1935] 2
('66', 59, 3, 4, 108909) It is impossible to over estimate the value of meticulous detail in your estimates.
('66', 59, 3, 5, 108993) The path of service to the Harijans is strait and sharp as the razor’s edge, simply because the goal is that of complete self purification.
('66', 59, 3, 6, 109133) We can never be too critical of ourselves and every pie we get must be received as a dedication to God and used as a sacred trust.
('66', 59, 3, 7, 109264) Broad heads, therefore, will never do, there is no room in your estimates for ‘etceteras’ and ‘sundries’.
('66', 59, 3, 8, 109370) For instance, I could not tolerate the item ‘books, slates, etc., given free’.
('66', 59, 3, 9, 109449) Supposing someone gave us a free gift of intoxicating drugs?
('66', 59, 3, 10, 109510) Would they come under the item?
('66', 59, 3, 11, 109542) No ‘post, telegrams, etc.’, either, nor newspapers, nor expenditure on rent.
('66', 59, 3, 12, 109619) For you should be in a position to say: ‘We do not need to spend money on telegrams, we send messages through kind messengers who will take them; we need spend nothing on rent, for we have persuaded some good friends to give us a house.’ Expenditure on administration I can tolerate only to a certain extent, and I do not see any need for separate propaganda.
('66', 59, 3, 13, 109979) Actual solid work is the most eloquent propaganda.
('66', 59, 3, 14, 110030) I confess I allowed myself to be used for the purpose in that I suffered Thakkar Bapa to carry me about in his circus for about a year; but though I went from place to place under his directions, I must say that the best and the only part I could reconcile myself to was the walking tour in Orissa.
('66', 59, 3, 15, 110329) Emulate me there if you can.
('66', 59, 3, 16, 110358) The mutest servant is the most eloquent propagandist.
('66', 59, 3, 17, 110412) Run a school yourself for Harijans, open a well or temple, help in digging a well or building a village school house for Harijans.
('66', 59, 3, 18, 110543) That will be true propaganda.
('66', 59, 3, 19, 110573) I would ask you to copy the example of Mr. Frazer Hoyland, a schoolmaster from South Wales, who has come to work with his own hands in the Bihar earthquake area under M. Pierre Ceresole.
('66', 59, 3, 20, 110760) He has worked among the unemployed people in England and Wales, and knows that writing books and pamphlets is no propaganda, but that manual work and sharing in the toil of people one would serve is true propaganda.
('66', 59, 3, 21, 110976) I should, therefore, not hesitate to drop the column for propaganda.
('66', 59, 3, 22, 111045) You have a column showing office expenses.
('66', 59, 3, 23, 111088) I can understand that in our poor country we cannot run our offices free of cost, but even there, run it through Harijans.
('66', 59, 3, 24, 111211) If we must have peons, have only Harijans for the purpose,

('66', 60, 1, 2, 111405) not treating them as peons but as your sons or members of your family.
('66', 60, 1, 3, 111476) Expenditure on ashrams is a thing I must strongly warn you against.
('66', 60, 1, 4, 111544) Let us drop the name of ‘ashram’ for it cannot be run without a solid fund of moral and spiritual capital.
('66', 60, 1, 5, 111651) One of the branch Sanghs has budgeted Rs. 8,000 for an ashram.
('66', 60, 1, 6, 111714) Well, I should rule it out, unless they can show that they are doing work worth 8 lacs.
('66', 60, 1, 7, 111802) Broadly I might say that you should not spend a rupee until you are sure that you are getting ten rupees’ worth of work out of it.

('66', 60, 5, 12, 112086) It is a bad habit to write while eating and it is equally bad to write with a pencil.

('66', 60, 5, 14, 112220) It seems that your ear is still giving you trouble.

('66', 60, 9, 23, 112515) Yes you can start with the girls who may come from Wardha.
('66', 60, 9, 24, 112574) But all this you should do only if you and Janammal are sure of sticking to your work.
('66', 60, 9, 25, 112661) You must not rely upon others helping you.
('66', 60, 9, 26, 112704) They may come and afterwards leave you.
('66', 60, 9, 27, 112744) Of course if you go in for the ashram you have to adopt the ashram life more or less.

('66', 61, 5, 12, 113422) JAMNALAL, The Delhi cold, instead of helping me to work harder, makes me do less work when so much work has piled up.
('66', 61, 5, 13, 113540) What you say about Abhyankar is indeed what has happened.
('66', 61, 5, 14, 113598) His loss is bound to be felt.
('66', 61, 5, 15, 113628) It seems that your ear is taking quite a lot of time to be fully cured.
('66', 61, 5, 16, 113700) It will not matter at all if you cannot come.
('66', 61, 5, 17, 113746) Nothing should be done which may interfere with the cure of your ear.
('66', 61, 5, 18, 113816) Kamalnayan 1 cannot be sent to Ceylon now, not as long as malaria is raging there.
('66', 61, 5, 19, 113899) The discharge from Om’s ear persists.
('66', 61, 5, 20, 113937) Last week, I had sent her a wire and asked her to go to Bombay immediately and consult a doctor there.
('66', 61, 5, 21, 114040) She doesn’t seem yet to have done so.
('66', 61, 5, 22, 114078) I would advise you to call her and get her ear examined by some doctor.
('66', 61, 5, 23, 114150) Lali seems to have settled down.
('66', 61, 5, 24, 114183) Mehr’s case is difficult.
('66', 61, 5, 25, 114209) She has been staying at Dr. Ansari’s place from the day she arrived here.
('66', 61, 5, 26, 114283) She just dropped in casually once.
('66', 61, 5, 27, 114318) She has come to develop a feeling of revulsion against the Ashram.
('66', 61, 5, 28, 114385) We shall have to leave her here.
('66', 61, 5, 29, 114418) Fortunately, Dr. Khan Saheb’s wife is arriving here.
('66', 61, 5, 30, 114471) Mehr will perhaps stay with her.
('66', 61, 5, 31, 114504) I wish to return to Wardha on the 22nd, and in any case on the 29th at the latest.

('66', 62, 7, 10, 115209) I have not yet been able to write about the incidents in the Ramayana.
('66', 62, 7, 11, 115280) In fact I have forgotten all that I was told about them.
('66', 62, 7, 12, 115337) Now I shall have to write anew.
('66', 62, 7, 13, 115369) I therefore want to consider some incidents.
('66', 62, 7, 14, 115414) We must find that essay of Shastri on cow protection.
('66', 62, 7, 15, 115468) If you can find another secretary devoted to the cow, l shall entrust this task to him.
('66', 62, 7, 16, 115556) If you cannot, you should start doing some work yourself instead of being there merely in name.
('66', 62, 7, 17, 115652) Here again what is required is strength of character, not physical strength.
('66', 62, 7, 18, 115729) How are your eyes?
('66', 62, 7, 19, 115748) Try wet sheet packs soaked in fresh milk when you go to sleep at night— whether or not your eyes are all right—will you?
('66', 62, 7, 20, 115869) There is no harm in it.
('66', 62, 7, 21, 115893) I have your Ramakatha in front of me and I am going to read it.

('66', 63, 1, 2, 116287) As for the question where you are to stay, it would be highly improper for me to write to Manibhai while you are still there.
('66', 63, 1, 3, 116413) Ask him yourself.
('66', 63, 1, 4, 116431) If you see any sign of unwillingness on his part, write to me.
('66', 63, 1, 5, 116494) Still if you feel that you cannot talk to him, use the accompanying letter.
('66', 63, 1, 6, 116570) You may go to Lakhtar or Bardoli whenever you feel you should do so.
('66', 63, 1, 7, 116639) I am writing to Jamnalalji 1 about the expense.
('66', 63, 1, 8, 116687) Since you say nothing about your health, I assume it is good enough.
('66', 63, 1, 9, 116756) I have had a letter from the Vaidayaraj which is enclosed.
('66', 63, 1, 10, 116815) As for the particulars about your health, it is for you to supply them.
('66', 63, 1, 11, 116887) If you do feel the need to put yourself under somebody’s treatment, it would be advisable to meet Kuvalaynand or Gaurishanker.
('66', 63, 1, 12, 117014) You may then go for treatment to whichever of the two places you like.
('66', 63, 1, 13, 117085) I take it that you will get yourself X rayed by Dr. Jivraj.
('66', 63, 1, 14, 117145) Nimu does not seem inclined to leave Wardha, for the present at any rate.
('66', 63, 1, 15, 117219) She herself must have written to you about Narandas’s letter.
('66', 63, 1, 16, 117281) It is quite cold here, so much that one is unable to write as much as one would want to.
('66', 63, 1, 17, 117370) We are camping in the countryside.
('66', 63, 1, 18, 117405) The air is pure.
('66', 63, 1, 19, 117422) Both the place and the air are ideal for physical work.

('66', 65, 3, 26, 120570) Do not give any cause to Lilavatibehn for being unhappy.
('66', 65, 3, 27, 120627) Untruth does certainly follow truth; but ultimately it is left behind.
('66', 65, 3, 28, 120698) Certainly even indigenous mills will render thousands of people unemployed, so only hand pounded rice should be used.
('66', 65, 3, 29, 120816) Your mind is full of so many things that unless you act spiritedly, you won’t be able to achieve anything.
('66', 65, 3, 30, 120923) It is better if you ponder over it and do what you feel is necessary.

('66', 66, 14, 19, 121882) I was glad to hear from you after so many years.
('66', 66, 14, 20, 121931) I am keeping myself in touch with Shantilal.
('66', 66, 14, 21, 121976) I shall do what I can to help him.
('66', 66, 14, 22, 122011) But to give personal attention to anybody has become almost impossible for me.
('66', 66, 14, 23, 122090) That chapter of my life seems to have closed altogether.

('66', 67, 4, 11, 122913) C. KUTTAN NAIR 2
('66', 67, 5, 12, 122930) January 8, 1935
('66', 67, 6, 13, 122946) NAIR: It is my feeling, especially after attending the All India Women’s Conference at Karachi, that the women’s movement in India is not a representative one.
('66', 67, 6, 14, 123106) It only represents the aristocracy and upper middle class.
('66', 67, 6, 15, 123165) Can you suggest practical measures to make it a real mass movement?
('66', 67, 7, 16, 123233) GANDHIJI: The obvious remedy would be for the existing members to throw themselves in the khaddar and other village industry movements and thus develop the village instinct and take pride in depending on villages for all their wants.
('66', 67, 8, 17, 123467) N. Do you not think that co education from very early days till the end of the educational career will help a great deal in removing the sex obsession that we see in our midst today?
('66', 67, 9, 18, 123650) G. I cannot definitely state as yet whether it would be successful or not.
('66', 67, 9, 19, 123725) It does not seem to have succeeded in the West.
('66', 67, 9, 20, 123773) I tried it myself years ago when I even made boys and girls sleep in the same verandah with no partition between them, Mrs. Gandhi and myself sharing the verandah with them.
('66', 67, 9, 21, 123947) I must say that it brought about undesirable results.
('66', 67, 10, 22, 124001) N. But do not worse things happen in purdah ridden communities?
('66', 67, 11, 23, 124065) G. Yes, of course, but co education is still in an experimental stage and we cannot definitely say one way or the other as to its results.
('66', 67, 11, 24, 124204) I think that we should begin with the family first.
('66', 67, 11, 25, 124256) There, boys and girls should grow together freely and naturally.
('66', 67, 11, 26, 124321) Then co education will come by itself.
('66', 67, 12, 27, 124360) 1 Omission as in the source 2 A leading social worker of Cochin.
('66', 67, 12, 28, 124425) The notes of the interview prepared by the interviewer were revised by Gandhiji.
('66', 68, 0, 1, 124506) VOL. 66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 69
('66', 68, 1, 2, 124552) N. As a teacher who has moved rather intimately with her students I have had occasion to come across some who, through ignorance and through information gathered from unhealthy sources during the period of adolescence, resorted to practices that were not conducive either to their physical or moral well being.
('66', 68, 1, 3, 124863) Will not the teaching of sex hygiene in schools in the most scientific and informal manner be really beneficial to our boys and girls.
('66', 68, 2, 4, 124998) G. Yes.
('66', 68, 2, 5, 125006) And there should be no reason why one should not be able to talk freely on this matter.
('66', 68, 3, 6, 125094) N. On discussing very freely the question of birth control with many a married woman, I find in many cases, specially in the case of those with large families, that motherhood is often thrust upon them.
('66', 68, 3, 7, 125297) Woman has no freedom in the real sense of the word if she has no right over her body.
('66', 68, 3, 8, 125383) So for the sake of the mother, whose health is drained away by the bringing forth of too many children and for the sake of children themselves, who should be a joy to us, but who now come forth unwanted in such large numbers, may not birth control through contraceptives be resorted to, as the next best thing to self control, which is too high an ideal for the ordinary man or woman?
('66', 68, 3, 9, 125768) G. Do you think that the freedom of the body is obtained by resorting to contraceptives?
('66', 68, 3, 10, 125857) Women should learn to resist their husbands.
('66', 68, 3, 11, 125902) If contraceptives are resorted to as in the West, frightful results will follow.
('66', 68, 3, 12, 125983) Men and women will be living for sex alone.
('66', 68, 3, 13, 126027) They will become soft brained, unhinged, in fact mental and moral wrecks, if not also physical.
('66', 68, 3, 14, 126123) Then, while I believe man to be the worse sinner, woman is not very far behind him.
('66', 68, 3, 15, 126207) Both sin, on the whole.
('66', 68, 3, 16, 126231) Woman is not always the victim.
('66', 68, 3, 17, 126263) She should realize her majesty and train herself to say “No” when she means it.
('66', 68, 4, 18, 126343) N. But is there not too much of sex indulgence even now and is the introduction of contraceptives going to make so much difference in the sex life of the individual?
('66', 68, 4, 19, 126509) G. Undoubtedly there is already much of sex indulgence and even sex perversion.
('66', 68, 4, 20, 126589) But contraceptives would be putting the cap on them.
('66', 68, 4, 21, 126642) They will give a status to intemperate connection which it does not enjoy now.
('66', 68, 5, 22, 126721) N. Even in exceptional cases where a woman is too weak for child bearing or where either of the parents is diseased, cannot this method be resorted to?
('66', 68, 6, 23, 126873) One exception will lead to another till it finally becomes general.
('66', 68, 6, 24, 126941) In the cases stated above, it is better that the husband and the wife live apart.
('66', 68, 6, 25, 127023) Contraceptives which are being tried in the West are leading to hideous immorality and I am sure after a few years, the Westerners themselves will realize their mistake.
('66', 68, 6, 26, 127193) Do you not know that Mussolini in Italy is giving donations to parents with large families?
('66', 69, 0, 1, 127285) 70 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 69, 1, 2, 127326) N. Perhaps Mussolini wants more fodder for cannon.
('66', 69, 2, 3, 127377) G. What about the English and the Dutch among whom contraceptives are popular?
('66', 69, 2, 4, 127456) Are they against war?
('66', 69, 3, 5, 127478) N. Can a poor country like India afford to have its present vast population, which seems to increase at a tremendously rapid pace?
('66', 69, 4, 6, 127609) G. Nature will solve the problem for us, if we allow Nature to have free play.
('66', 69, 4, 7, 127688) Contraceptives are an unnatural interference with her laws.
('66', 69, 4, 8, 127748) If people want to multiply like rabbits, they will have also to die like rabbits.
('66', 69, 4, 9, 127830) If we become licentious, there will undoubtedly be Nature’s punishment descending upon us.
('66', 69, 4, 10, 127921) It will be a blessing in disguise.
('66', 69, 5, 11, 127956) N. But is self control possible for the ordinary man and woman?
('66', 69, 6, 12, 128020) G. Yes, under well regulated conditions.
('66', 69, 6, 13, 128061) Contraceptives are really for the educated people, who are the “sick” of humanity.
('66', 69, 6, 14, 128144) I call them “sick” because their food and drink and the exceedingly artificial life that they are leading have made them weak willed and slaves to their passions.
('66', 69, 7, 15, 128307) N. Do you then suggest, Mahatmaji, as a practical remedy for the over indulgence in sex today, the releasing of the creative energy in man, through channels other than sex, by concentrating on matters like art, science, literature, etc.?
('66', 69, 8, 16, 128545) G. That is true so far as it goes.
('66', 69, 8, 17, 128580) You have to be very careful in the choice of your food and drink and to keep both mind and body clean.
('66', 69, 8, 18, 128683) Just as it is important to know what goes to the mind it is equally necessary to know what goes into the body.
('66', 69, 8, 19, 128794) These are simple things, which will help you a great deal in the matter of self control.
('66', 69, 9, 20, 128883) N. You know that in India there is no bar for physically unfit people to marry and bring forth children.
('66', 69, 9, 21, 128988) Moreover, Hindu religion enjoins that none could get salvation without there being some male member to perform shraddha ceremony.
('66', 69, 9, 22, 129118) This in normal circumstances is resulting in degeneration of the Hindu race.
('66', 69, 9, 23, 129195) Are you, under these conditions, in favour of sterilization as is being done in Germany under Hitler?
('66', 69, 10, 24, 129297) G. There are crores of Hindus, especially untouchables who do not perform the shraddha ceremony.
('66', 69, 10, 25, 129394) As regards sterilization I consider it inhuman to impose it as a law on the people.
('66', 69, 10, 26, 129478) But in the case of individuals with chronic diseases, it is desirable to have them sterilized if they are agreeable to it.
('66', 69, 10, 27, 129601) Sterilization is a sort of contraceptive and though I am against the use of contraceptives in the case of women, I do not mind voluntary sterilization in the case of
('66', 70, 0, 1, 129767) VOL. 66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 71
('66', 70, 1, 2, 129813) man, since he is the aggressor.
('66', 70, 2, 3, 129845) N. Mahatmaji, you say that a woman should not allow motherhood to be thrust upon herself but that she should be able to assert herself and definitely say “No” to her husband.
('66', 70, 2, 4, 130020) Have you considered the fact that a Hindu woman especially has no economic status, and her defying her “Lord and Master” may result in disastrous consequences for her, and according to law she may be denied even maintenance, not to speak of a second home?
('66', 70, 3, 5, 130276) G. If you study statistics, you will find that what you say about the economic condition of a Hindu woman holds good only in the case of a microscopic minority.
('66', 70, 3, 6, 130437) Do you not know that in Indian houses it is the woman that is generally the real master?
('66', 70, 4, 7, 130526) N. May I know how far your experiments in self control in the Sabarmati Ashram have been successful?
('66', 70, 5, 8, 130627) G. It is very difficult to say.
('66', 70, 5, 9, 130659) We have had individual cases of terrible tragedy, but those who visited the Ashram were much impressed by the general atmosphere of freedom, without sex consciousness, that prevailed there.

('66', 70, 9, 13, 130938) [HALIDE EDIB:] How will you fight the curse of mechanization, Gandhiji?
('66', 70, 9, 14, 131010) How will you keep human beings human souls?
('66', 70, 9, 15, 131054) [GANDHIJI:] It is all implied in my non violence, Hindu Muslim unity, the removal of untouchability and giving back to the villagers what belongs to them.
('66', 70, 9, 16, 131209) The Harijan activity and the movement for the revival of village industries come naturally to me because of non violence.
('66', 70, 9, 17, 131331) It is cruel, it is sinful, to think of mechanizationin a country of 350 million human beings.
('66', 70, 9, 18, 131425) Every human being is a machine, only it should be kept oiled and in proper trim.

('66', 71, 0, 1, 131929) 72 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 71, 1, 2, 131970) I am trying to do.
('66', 71, 2, 3, 131989) Political freedom, I am sure, you are going to win but mechanization, I am afraid, might get hold of India.
('66', 71, 2, 4, 132097) Then, there is no escape from violence.
('66', 71, 2, 5, 132137) I saw it as long ago as 1908, and ever since I have shaped all my activities in terms of non violence.
('66', 71, 2, 6, 132240) Complete mechanization is impossible in India without its resulting in violence in some shape or other.
('66', 71, 3, 7, 132344) I know, I know.
('66', 71, 3, 8, 132360) But it’s so difficult.
('66', 71, 3, 9, 132383) The soul has to be preserved.
('66', 71, 3, 10, 132413) I have written a play called Masques and Souls.
('66', 71, 3, 11, 132461) There are more masques than souls, but if you will prepare a nursery of souls, it would be all to the good.
('66', 71, 3, 12, 132569) Oh yes, if we can find even one true witness to the Truth.
('66', 71, 4, 13, 132628) I am not very optimistic, for the opposite side is very strong.
('66', 71, 4, 14, 132692) I have never lost my optimism.
('66', 71, 4, 15, 132723) In the seemingly darkest hours, hope has burnt bright within me.
('66', 71, 5, 16, 132788) You cannot kill your own hope, I know.
('66', 71, 5, 17, 132827) You are absolutely right.
('66', 71, 5, 18, 132853) I cannot kill the hope myself.
('66', 71, 5, 19, 132884) I must say I cannot give an ocular demonstration to justify the hope.
('66', 71, 5, 20, 132954) But there is no defeat in me.
('66', 71, 6, 21, 132984) There will never be, I am sure, there will never be.

('66', 72, 7, 10, 133916) The socialists met him again and discussed the village industries problem from the socialist point of view.
('66', 72, 7, 11, 134024) They are stated to have said that the first step in village programme should be to improve the condition of kisans who were being downtrodden by the zamindars and propaganda should be carried on amongst the kisans not to submit to the unfairness they are at present subjected to.
('66', 72, 7, 12, 134304) Gandhiji, it is understood, did not agree with this view and opined that attempts should be made to retain cordial relations between the two parties.
('66', 72, 7, 13, 134454) Any split should be avoided and zamindars’ sympathies should not be alienated in order to make the present programme succeed.
('66', 72, 7, 14, 134580) He said that the time was not ripe to bring about a complete change all of a sudden, though that stage might be reached after some time.
('66', 72, 7, 15, 134717) He said that the socialists’ idea to revolutionize the present state of things might result in the zamindars seeking shelter with the third party.

('66', 72, 10, 18, 134923) January 10, 1935
('66', 72, 11, 19, 134940) What do you think about the latest move of the Government regarding your Village Industries scheme?
('66', 72, 12, 20, 135040) I should be very glad if Government were to take the wind out of my sails.
('66', 72, 12, 21, 135115) Much of the work that I propose doing is what Government ought to do.
('66', 72, 12, 22, 135185) Let Government do whatever they can do, only let not anything be superimposed on the people.
('66', 72, 12, 23, 135278) If Government helped me, I could produce magical results; but it could be possible
('66', 72, 13, 24, 135361) 1 The subscription is in Gujarati.
('66', 72, 13, 25, 135396) 2 The Government had proposed allotment of one crore of rupees to the provinces for the economic development and improvement of the rural areas in order to forestall Congress activities in the villages and had issued a confidential circular in this connection.

('66', 73, 1, 2, 135698) only if they helped me in the right spirit.
('66', 73, 1, 3, 135742) In other words, the Government should understand and appreciate the secrets of the programme.
('66', 73, 1, 4, 135836) 1 There are so many ways in which they could help.
('66', 73, 1, 5, 135887) They could help with the necessary legislation.
('66', 73, 1, 6, 135935) But pray don’t ask me to express any opinion on what Government are doing.
('66', 73, 1, 7, 136010) I do not want to criticize their work.
('66', 73, 1, 8, 136049) If it were necessary, I should write to them.
('66', 73, 1, 9, 136095) So far as I am concerned my life is an open book, and there is absolutely nothing that I would keep secret from them.
('66', 73, 1, 10, 136213) I have necessarily chosen items to which nobody’s attention has been drawn and where I do not trench on ground covered by others.
('66', 73, 1, 11, 136343) Thus, in my campaign for unpolished rice, hand ground flour and village made gur, I am simply asking people not to pay for undermining their health.
('66', 73, 1, 12, 136492) For that is what they are at present doing, and I am thankful to say that I am supported in my view by the highest experts in the land.
('66', 73, 1, 13, 136628) I dare not think of land improvement and improvement in the methods of agriculture, for I know my limitations, and I want people to do all that they can do without any outside help.
('66', 73, 1, 14, 136810) My only object is to abolish idleness, to help people to turn their time to good account, to prevent misfeeding and to stop all economic waste.
('66', 73, 1, 15, 136954) The whole of my campaign for unpolished rice, for hand ground flour, for gur, for hand pressed oil and for the economic disposal of carcasses should be looked at in that light.
('66', 73, 2, 16, 137131) The village uplift programme is not a new idea though the Congress, at its Bombay session recently, adopted it as one of the channels of its constructive programme of work.
('66', 73, 2, 17, 137304) 3 I have spoken of it to the public during the last eight months.
('66', 73, 3, 18, 137370) Gandhiji spoke eloquently on the powers of takli and said that recently a spinner from Manchester had examined it and testified to its potentialities.
('66', 73, 3, 19, 137521) The takli which once hardly exceeded the speed of a hundred yards per hour now operated at four hundred yards: It is a marvellous thing and with intelligence applied to it can produce an enormous change for the better.
('66', 73, 4, 20, 137740) Proceeding, Mahatmaji emphasized that the Village Industries Association had excluded politics from its ken.
('66', 73, 4, 21, 137849) Questioned as to the progress he had made in his work at Delhi Gandhiji said he was presently going slow in collecting materials and liked to see its great

('66', 73, 5, 23, 138062) 2 What follows is from The Hindustan Times report.
('66', 73, 5, 24, 138113) 3 In the circular the Government had described the Bombay session of the Congress as the greatest personal triumph of Gandhiji.

('66', 74, 1, 3, 138303) The Spinners’ Association had distributed one and a half crores of rupees among 160,000 people of which 120,000 were spinners, 24,000 washermen, and the rest weavers.
('66', 74, 1, 4, 138470) From the competitive point of view there was no reason why the village industries meant to promote villagers’ welfare should not hold their own against mechanized industries, provided it was clearly understood that village production was for its own consumption.
('66', 74, 1, 5, 138733) This policy had been recognized as economic even outside India and if followed would do great good to India.
('66', 74, 1, 6, 138842) It was important not only from the general economic point of view but from other considerations so far as rice, wheat and sugar were concerned, for village products contained more vitamins and proteins whereas in industrialized products these were absent.

('66', 74, 5, 10, 139205) AMBUJAM 1, I have your letter.
('66', 74, 5, 11, 139236) You must put your body in perfect order by taking the food that suits you best.
('66', 74, 5, 12, 139316) You should be the best judge of what suits you if you choose your food for health and not for the pleasure of the palate.
('66', 74, 5, 13, 139438) I have no fear that you will make your choice from the latter standpoint.
('66', 74, 5, 14, 139512) We have here a good variety of bhaji—pea leaves, mustard leaves, carrot leaves, fine radish leaves, palak.
('66', 74, 5, 15, 139619) It is good you are taking butter.
('66', 74, 5, 16, 139653) Are you taking enough exercise?
('66', 74, 5, 17, 139685) It will not do for you to open an ashram without Janammal.
('66', 74, 5, 18, 139744) If, therefore, she can’t come to the village, you should fix your ashram in Madras, unless Father desires otherwise.
('66', 74, 5, 19, 139861) I like the idea of Father settling down in a village, even if it be for a time.
('66', 74, 5, 20, 139941) We are sleeping in an open verandah with a roof on it.
('66', 74, 5, 21, 139996) There is danger of morning dew here and there is not convenience enough for me here to try the experiment of sleeping right under the sky.
('66', 74, 5, 22, 140135) It is good you saw Kakasaheb and discussed with him the question of the best method of learning Hindi.
('66', 74, 5, 23, 140238) Do come in close contact with him.
('66', 74, 5, 24, 140273) He will be a good guide in educational matters.
('66', 74, 5, 25, 140321) The bill for the paper and envelopes amounted I think to nearly Rs. 22. I thought it was sent to you.
('66', 74, 5, 26, 140423) I shall inquire.
('66', 74, 5, 27, 140440) Do not send me any envelopes.
('66', 74, 5, 28, 140470) I have some myself.
('66', 74, 5, 29, 140490) But I am using those made by us out of waste paper so long as it lasts.

('66', 75, 6, 12, 140954) I still feel that it would be better for you to go to Bombay once and consult an ear specialist.

('66', 76, 2, 3, 141697) DELHI, January 13, 1935
('66', 76, 3, 4, 141721) I hope you will gladly welcome the compromise arrived at in the dispute that was going on regarding your wages.
('66', 76, 3, 5, 141833) 1 It will be in your interest to accept willingly the cut in your wages —that will enhance your credit too, I have no doubt about it.
('66', 76, 3, 6, 141967) I do not consider it a small matter that the main principle of the policy which we wanted to adopt years ago has been accepted in this compromise.
('66', 76, 3, 7, 142114) Now we have to make a scheme at our earliest convenience to implement it.
('66', 76, 3, 8, 142188) I need not tell you that its success mostly depends on your pure intentions and conduct.
('66', 76, 3, 9, 142277) The welfare of both the employees and the employers lies in the mill continuing to function.
('66', 76, 3, 10, 142370) He who understands this will never find it difficult to understand this compromise.
('66', 76, 3, 11, 142454) I have been telling you from the very beginning of our acquaintance that the industry exclusively belongs neither to the mill owners nor to the labourers.
('66', 76, 3, 12, 142609) The capital of the owners is money while yours is labour.
('66', 76, 3, 13, 142667) Both of these are useless unless there is unity between the two.
('66', 76, 3, 14, 142732) If you have grasped what I am saying you will realize that the good of both lies in this compromise.
('66', 76, 3, 15, 142833) You will also know how much progress we have made and how near we are towards the realization of the dream that we had been cherishing all along.
('66', 76, 3, 16, 142979) I therefore hope that all the sisters and brothers will unanimously accept the compromise.

('66', 76, 6, 20, 143153) [Before January 14, 1935] 2
('66', 76, 7, 21, 143181) Your campaign 3 is taking away from the Missionary’s popularity.
('66', 76, 7, 22, 143246) [GANDHIJI:] I see what you mean but I do not know why it should disturb them.
('66', 76, 7, 23, 143324) We are not traders trenching on one another’s province.
('66', 76, 7, 24, 143380) If it is a matter of serving oneself, I should understand their attitude, but when it is entirely a matter of serving others, it should not worry them or me as to who serves them.

('66', 77, 1, 2, 143726) But, perhaps, the authorities in charge of a Mission hospital would rightly feel worried if you sent your people to go and open a hospital in the same place.
('66', 77, 1, 3, 143884) But they should understand that ours is a different mission.
('66', 77, 1, 4, 143945) We do not go there to afford them simple medical relief or a knowledge of the three R’s; our going to them is a small proof of our repentance and our assurance to them that we will not exploit them any more.
('66', 77, 1, 5, 144153) I should never think of opening a hospital where there is already one; but if there is a Mission school, I should not mind opening another for Harijan children, and I would even encourage them to prefer our school to the other.
('66', 77, 1, 6, 144381) Let us frankly understand the position.
('66', 77, 1, 7, 144421) If the object is purely humanitarian, purely that of carrying education where there is none, they should be thankful that someone whose obvious duty it is to put his own house in order wakes up to a sense of his duty.
('66', 77, 1, 8, 144639) But my trouble is that the Missionary friends do not bring to bear on their work a purely humanitarian spirit.
('66', 77, 1, 9, 144750) Their object is to add more members to their fold, and that is why they are disturbed.
('66', 77, 1, 10, 144837) The complaint which I have been making all these years is more than justified by what you say.
('66', 77, 1, 11, 144932) Some of the friends of a Mission were the other day in high glee over the conversion to Christianity of a learned pandit.
('66', 77, 1, 12, 145054) They have been dear friends, and so I told them that it was hardly proper to go into ecstasies over a man forsaking his religion.
('66', 77, 1, 13, 145184) Today it is the case of a learned Hindu, tomorrow it may be that of an ignorant villager not knowing the principles of his religion.
('66', 77, 1, 14, 145317) Why should Missionaries complain if I open a school which is more liked by Harijans than theirs?
('66', 77, 1, 15, 145414) Is it not natural?
('66', 77, 2, 16, 145433) But does it mean that you would say the same thing about a Christian who embraces Hinduism?
('66', 77, 2, 17, 145525) I would.
('66', 77, 2, 18, 145534) Here is Mirabehn.
('66', 77, 2, 19, 145552) I would have her find all the spiritual comfort she needs from Christianity, and I should not dream of converting her to Hinduism, even if she wanted to do so.
('66', 77, 2, 20, 145712) Today it is the case of a grown up woman like her, tomorrow it may be that of a European child trusted to my care by a friend.
('66', 77, 2, 21, 145839) Take the case of Khan Saheb’s daughter entrusted to my care by her father.
('66', 77, 2, 22, 145914) I should jealously educate her in her own faith and should strive my utmost against her being lured away from it if ever she was so inclined.
('66', 77, 2, 23, 146056) I have had the privilege of having children and grown up persons of other faiths with me.
('66', 77, 2, 24, 146146) I was thankful to find them better Christians, Mussalmans, Parsis or Jews by their contact with me.
('66', 77, 3, 25, 146246) But if it was a pure case of conscience?
('66', 78, 0, 1, 146287) VOL. 66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 79
('66', 78, 1, 2, 146333) I am no keeper of anybody’s conscience, but I do feel that it argues some sort of weakness on the part of a person who easily declares his or her failure to derive comfort from the faith in which he or she is born.

('66', 78, 3, 5, 146606) DELHI, January 14, 1935 Though I had always longed for it, I was never able to be with Khan Saheb Abdul Ghaffar Khan for any length of time before the closing months of last year.
('66', 78, 3, 6, 146786) Good fortune, however, brought me not only the younger brother but also the elder, Dr. Khan Saheb, very soon after their discharge from Hazaribagh prison.
('66', 78, 3, 7, 146941) As luck would have it, they were under orders not to enter the Frontier Province till 28th December last.
('66', 78, 3, 8, 147047) They were under discipline not to offer Civil Disobedience.
('66', 78, 3, 9, 147107) And so they accepted the hospitality of Seth Jamnalal Bajaj in Wardha.
('66', 78, 3, 10, 147178) I was thus privileged to come in intimate touch with the brothers.
('66', 78, 3, 11, 147245) The more I knew them the more attracted I felt towards them.
('66', 78, 3, 12, 147306) I was struck by their transparent sincerity, frankness and utmostsimplicity.
('66', 78, 3, 13, 147383) I observed, too, that they had come to believe in truth and non violence, not as a policy but as a creed.
('66', 78, 3, 14, 147489) The younger brother, I found, was consumed with deep religious fervour.
('66', 78, 3, 15, 147561) His was not a narrow creed.
('66', 78, 3, 16, 147589) I found him to be a universalist.
('66', 78, 3, 17, 147623) His politics, if he had any, were derived from his religion.
('66', 78, 3, 18, 147684) The Doctor had no politics.
('66', 78, 3, 19, 147712) This privileged contact led me to the conclusion that the brothers were much misunderstood.
('66', 78, 3, 20, 147804) I, therefore, asked Mahadev Desai to note all he could from them of their lives and prepare for the public a sketch introducing them as men.
('66', 78, 3, 21, 147945) He was to leave politics alone and avoid criticism of the Government.
('66', 78, 3, 22, 148015) The result is this character sketch.
('66', 78, 3, 23, 148052) Let the reader judge whether the brothers’ claim to be known as simple Khudai Khidmatgars (i.e., Servants of God) is vindicated by the following pages, assuming that they give an accurate and truthful recital of the events of their lives as the brothers gave them to Mahadev Desai.

('66', 79, 7, 13, 149038) Do not overstrain yourself.
('66', 79, 7, 14, 149066) Ramdas feels that Manilal 1 is not very eager that the former should continue to stay at Manibhuvan 2. It is best, therefore, that he should leave the place.
('66', 79, 7, 15, 149224) He wishes to rent a separate room for himself and has asked for Rs. 25 as rent for it.
('66', 79, 7, 16, 149311) I think we should let him have it.
('66', 79, 7, 17, 149346) I know that all this is wrong.
('66', 79, 7, 18, 149377) But Ramdas’s illness is of such a nature that in his case wrong seems right.
('66', 79, 7, 19, 149454) I do not know how far a father’s love is misleading me in this matter.
('66', 79, 7, 20, 149525) If you disapprove of this demand of Ramdas, by all means tell him so.
('66', 79, 7, 21, 149595) You earned the privilege of doing so many years ago.
('66', 79, 7, 22, 149648) Do what seems proper to you.
('66', 79, 7, 23, 149677) I understand what you say about Swaruprani.
('66', 79, 7, 24, 149721) Sarup wires to me from time to time.
('66', 79, 7, 25, 149758) I must stay on here till the 25th at any rate, although we must leave here latest by the 28th.
('66', 79, 7, 26, 149853) Rajaji is coming tomorrow with Lakshmi.
('66', 79, 7, 27, 149893) Do you see Jayaprakash?

('66', 80, 4, 6, 150181) You are economizing very well.
('66', 80, 4, 7, 150212) You must no more fall ill.
('66', 80, 4, 8, 150239) Accept Narandas’s advice in matters of food, studies, etc.
('66', 80, 4, 9, 150298) I obviously cannot guide you from this distance.

('66', 80, 9, 15, 150551) NARANDAS,
('66', 80, 10, 16, 150561) I got your three letters.
('66', 80, 10, 17, 150587) I had asked Mahadev to reply to the first.
('66', 80, 10, 18, 150630) I understand about Aunt 1. I shall be happy if she feels satisfied.
('66', 80, 10, 19, 150698) It was good that the leg was operated on.
('66', 80, 10, 20, 150740) Send me separately the figure of the expenditure incurred on this treatment.
('66', 80, 10, 21, 150817) Pay the money from the balance of the Ashram funds with you.
('66', 80, 10, 22, 150878) I think the monthly allowance is paid by Behcharlal.
('66', 80, 10, 23, 150931) Am I right?
('66', 80, 10, 24, 150943) I have a faint impression that it is so.
('66', 80, 10, 25, 150984) Inquire and let me know.
('66', 80, 10, 26, 151009) Is Aunt calm?
('66', 80, 10, 27, 151023) Does Manu go to help her?
('66', 80, 10, 28, 151049) Is Phuli 2 there?
('66', 80, 10, 29, 151067) Does she faithfully follow her dharma?
('66', 80, 10, 30, 151106) If we understand the real meaning of illness, it is a test of the person who is ill as also of his neighbours and relations.
('66', 80, 10, 31, 151231) If God had ordered an even life for all, who would have tested whom?
('66', 80, 10, 32, 151300) Who is Dr. Jadavrai?
('66', 80, 11, 33, 151321) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] There was nothing serious with my feet.
('66', 80, 11, 34, 151387) The skin had cracked because I had been careless during the cold.
('66', 80, 11, 35, 151453) Stopping walks and proper care of the wound have cured it.

('66', 81, 2, 3, 151707) January 14, 1935
('66', 81, 3, 4, 151724) RAMDAS, I have your letter.
('66', 81, 3, 5, 151752) One ought not to stay where one feels oneself to be a burden on the hosts.
('66', 81, 3, 6, 151827) I understand what you say about your having to find a separate room.
('66', 81, 3, 7, 151896) I see that the Rs. 25 per month shall not now be sufficient to meet your needs.
('66', 81, 3, 8, 151976) You need not mind that.
('66', 81, 3, 9, 152000) Your peace of mind is what matters most.
('66', 81, 3, 10, 152041) I am writing to Jamnalalji 1
('66', 81, 4, 11, 152070) but at the same time you also should talk to him frankly.
('66', 81, 4, 12, 152128) He will immediately understand your need.
('66', 81, 4, 13, 152170) Pyarelal writes and tells me that you are much better than you were at Wardha.
('66', 81, 4, 14, 152249) I was pleased indeed to hear that.
('66', 81, 4, 15, 152284) You must have got my letter in which I mentioned the suggestion made by the Delhi tailor.
('66', 81, 4, 16, 152374) You need not get agitated by such a letter from me.
('66', 81, 4, 17, 152426) You may do what you yourself wish to do.
('66', 81, 4, 18, 152467) I will be perfectly satisfied with that.
('66', 81, 4, 19, 152508) Your good lies in following the inclination of your own nature.
('66', 81, 4, 20, 152572) You alone can know what will satisfy your nature.
('66', 81, 4, 21, 152622) There was really nothing.
('66', 81, 4, 22, 152648) 2 Does one talk about the chilblains one suffers from in winter?
('66', 81, 4, 23, 152713) But then, I am a Mahatma as they say, and so I must be an exception.
('66', 81, 4, 24, 152782) But now there is some relief even from that.
('66', 81, 4, 25, 152827) I had been somewhat careless and had therefore to stop going out for a walk for about four days.
('66', 81, 4, 26, 152924) Today I took one.
('66', 81, 4, 27, 152942) Your aunt has been ailing rather badly in Rajkot.
('66', 81, 4, 28, 152992) Harilal looks after the nursing.
('66', 81, 4, 29, 153025) I will probably be able to leave here 3 on the 25th; if not on 25th, then on the 28th certainly.
('66', 81, 4, 30, 153122) Do you visit Mathuradas?
('66', 81, 4, 31, 153147) I am sure you know that you can have a place in Jamnalalji’s store.
('66', 81, 4, 32, 153215) I should like you to be more regular in writing to me.
('66', 81, 4, 33, 153270) I had a letter from Sharma.
('66', 81, 4, 34, 153298) He is better now.
('66', 81, 4, 35, 153316) He has arranged for a separate house for himself.
('66', 81, 4, 36, 153366) He will come over by about the 20th.
('66', 81, 4, 37, 153403) I went and saw the school run by Giriraj.
('66', 81, 4, 38, 153445) It did not appeal to me.
('66', 81, 4, 39, 153470) He is of course working hard, but how can he show the concern that a mother or a father would?

('66', 82, 4, 8, 154058) Do those on whom you had pinned your hopes fulfil them?
('66', 82, 4, 9, 154114) How is Kalyandas faring?
('66', 82, 4, 10, 154139) At Kevalram’s, do they maintain the degree of cleanliness I insist on being maintained?
('66', 82, 4, 11, 154227) How many customers does he get?
('66', 82, 4, 12, 154259) How do you go there and return?
('66', 82, 4, 13, 154291) The eating house must be quite a distance from Manibhuvan.
('66', 82, 4, 14, 154350) I have already written and told you that Kanti 1 is here, haven’t I?
('66', 82, 4, 15, 154419) I have written to Harilal 2 to come over here.
('66', 82, 4, 16, 154466) Now a days I have taken charge of the kitchen at the new quarters.
('66', 82, 4, 17, 154533) Some new experiments are being tried.

('66', 83, 4, 15, 155387) What is the rent of the new house?
('66', 83, 4, 16, 155422) Have you taken it on lease?
('66', 83, 4, 17, 155450) I shall understand things better when you come here.
('66', 83, 4, 18, 155503) Ramdas and the children too will come, I suppose.

('66', 84, 6, 11, 156648) RAMDAS,
('66', 84, 7, 12, 156656) I got your letter.
('66', 84, 7, 13, 156675) Personally I like your taking your meals in Kevalram’s eating house.
('66', 84, 7, 14, 156744) I should like to know what you eat, but I am not particular about it.
('66', 84, 7, 15, 156814) All that I wish is that you may eat whatever pleases you and agrees with you and build up your body.
('66', 84, 7, 16, 156915) Of Dhiru, it is as you write.
('66', 84, 7, 17, 156945) You may certainly go whenever you wish to.
('66', 84, 7, 18, 156988) You have kept your bedding at Kalyandas’s place, but for sleeping you surely go to Manibhuvan, don’t you?
('66', 84, 7, 19, 157094) How much distance do you cover in your walks every day?
('66', 84, 7, 20, 157150) If you like to help Kevalram in his work in the eating house, doso.
('66', 84, 7, 21, 157218) I quite understand your being disinclined to go to Natal.
('66', 84, 7, 22, 157276) You must have written to Manilal accordingly.

('66', 85, 3, 4, 157828) GANGABEHN,
('66', 85, 4, 5, 157839) This, being hand made paper, is more expensive than ordinary paper and I, therefore, use it economically.
('66', 85, 4, 6, 157945) Since I started using it, consumption of paper has gone down to one half, just as consumption of khadi cloth has gone down to one tenth or even lower than that.
('66', 85, 4, 7, 158106) Everything indigenous is always cheaper in the end.
('66', 85, 4, 8, 158158) I am writing with a reed pen.
('66', 85, 4, 9, 158188) You are a keen observer.
('66', 85, 4, 10, 158213) Examine everything in your surroundings carefully.
('66', 85, 4, 11, 158264) Every article of food and clothing must, as far as possible, be indigenous.
('66', 85, 4, 12, 158340) Learn to eat fresh leaves uncooked, to drink milk without boiling it, to use wheat flour without sifting it and rice without polishing it.
('66', 85, 4, 13, 158479) If you learn only this and no more and teach the villagers to do likewise, crores of rupees will be saved.

('66', 85, 10, 20, 158772) I got your letter yesterday.
('66', 85, 10, 21, 158801) I am writing this reply the first thing in the morning, that is at 3.15. If it is your own wish to help Chandubhai, do so with pleasure.
('66', 85, 10, 22, 158938) I have no right to stop altruistic actions.
('66', 85, 10, 23, 158982) Pay him whatever sum you wish to without expecting that it will be returned.
('66', 85, 10, 24, 159059) No one would be at fault if it is not returned.
('66', 85, 10, 25, 159107) Business is like that.
('66', 85, 10, 26, 159130) Sometimes the dice throw is in one’s favour and then it goes on; and when it is not, it persists against one.
('66', 85, 10, 27, 159240) But then can we know what is good and what isbad for us?
('66', 85, 10, 28, 159297) Don’t therefore hesitate to do what your own atman bids you do.
('66', 85, 10, 29, 159361) The inclination to give away is always worth cultivating.
('66', 85, 10, 30, 159419) Do we really own what we regard as our own?

('66', 86, 1, 2, 159509) Don’t believe what you might hear regarding my feet or any other newspaper stories.
('66', 86, 1, 3, 159593) Great men’s boils become magnified into tumours.
('66', 86, 1, 4, 159642) We should therefore give no thought to the boils of mahatmas.
('66', 86, 1, 5, 159704) I am as well as I was in Wardha.
('66', 86, 1, 6, 159737) I shall be leaving behind a bad tooth!

('66', 86, 7, 13, 159991) I have your letter.
('66', 86, 7, 14, 160011) The only thing for treating chilblain is to keep the affected parts warm, even to the exclusion of open air exercise.
('66', 86, 7, 15, 160129) The newspapers are too amusing.
('66', 86, 7, 16, 160161) You must not put any faith in what you read in the newspapers, especially about events in the life of mahatmas.
('66', 86, 7, 17, 160273) Their pimples are turned into carbuncles and a simple headache becomes a sign of hastening end 1. .
('66', 86, 7, 18, 160373) I am glad you like Santiniketan so well and the people in it.
('66', 86, 7, 19, 160435) I am glad too that you are adding Bengali to your knowledge of languages.
('66', 86, 7, 20, 160509) You should ask Indira to write to me.
('66', 86, 7, 21, 160547) Get her mother’s address in Almora and write to her mother that you are teaching Indira French.
('66', 86, 7, 22, 160643) How many girls are you nursing?
('66', 86, 7, 23, 160675) What are they suffering from?
('66', 86, 7, 24, 160705) What is your time table?
('66', 86, 7, 25, 160730) Are you cooking your own food or are you taking only bread, raw vegetables and milk?

('66', 87, 8, 16, 161794) It is surprising that your weight is not increasing.

('66', 87, 8, 20, 162004) I hope you drink the milk as soon as it is extracted.
('66', 87, 8, 21, 162058) Is the vessel kept quite clean?

('66', 87, 8, 23, 162188) Do you wash your hands before milking?
('66', 87, 8, 24, 162227) Do you rub the cow’s body gently with a gunny bag?

('66', 88, 2, 3, 162552) DELHI, [January 17, 1935] 1
('66', 88, 3, 4, 162580) MY DEAR HARIBHAU,
('66', 88, 4, 5, 162598) I have your letter.
('66', 88, 4, 6, 162618) I can’t remember the letter you are referring to.
('66', 88, 4, 7, 162668) It is just likely that the tremendous pressure at which I am dealing with my correspondence has put your letter out of my mind and it is lying buried in the heap before me.
('66', 88, 4, 8, 162841) I have not said that there should be no propaganda.
('66', 88, 4, 9, 162893) Propaganda there must be.
('66', 88, 4, 10, 162919) I have said, and I still maintain, that there should be no paid propaganda or if there is, there ought to be a separate collection about it.
('66', 88, 4, 11, 163060) It is the business of savarna Hindus to organize such propaganda.
('66', 88, 4, 12, 163126) Therefore funds should be raised, if funds are necessary, earmarked for that purpose.
('66', 88, 4, 13, 163212) My own impression is that paid propaganda creates no effect whatsoever.
('66', 88, 4, 14, 163284) We conduct schools and hostels with a definite object, which is to discharge the obligation we owe to the Harijans.
('66', 88, 4, 15, 163400) It is wholly different in scope, therefore, from the establishment of schools, etc., under the old regime.
('66', 88, 4, 16, 163507) Every school we open is a fresh nail in the coffin of untouchability, and having travelled all over India in that cause you will let me judge the result.
('66', 88, 4, 17, 163661) It is therefore that I have said that the opening of schools and hostels [is] 2 the best propaganda for conducting the campaign against untouchability.
('66', 88, 4, 18, 163813) We have plenty of money; but where are the schoolmasters to be had?
('66', 88, 4, 19, 163881) Savarna schoolmasters are not to be picked up in the streets.
('66', 88, 4, 20, 163943) Now, reverse the process.
('66', 88, 4, 21, 163969) If you utilize 90 per cent of the funds for propaganda and reserve 10 per cent for schools, how will you measure the success you would have attained in the conversion of savarna Hindus as we are able to measure the result by the number of schools and hostels that we succeed in opening and conducting?
('66', 88, 4, 22, 164271) Daily I have letters from Harijans complaining of our spending money for purposes other than opening schools, hostels and the like.
('66', 88, 4, 23, 164403) I have no letter from anywhere complaining that we do not carry on enough propaganda.
('66', 88, 4, 24, 164489) Yours is the first letter received by me.
('66', 88, 5, 25, 164531) 1 The source has ‘17 1 1934’ which is evidently a slip.
('66', 88, 5, 26, 164587) In January, 1934 Gandhiji was on tour in the South.
('66', 88, 5, 27, 164639) 2 The source has ‘are’.
('66', 89, 0, 1, 164663) 90 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 89, 1, 2, 164704) In Maharashtra I do not know what you will do in the matter of propaganda even if the whole of the collections were to be used by you for propaganda work.
('66', 89, 1, 3, 164859) Show me a programme and I am prepared to examine it on its own merits.
('66', 89, 1, 4, 164930) I have no bias.
('66', 89, 1, 5, 164946) One way or the other, my sole concern is to see that untouchability is removed.
('66', 89, 1, 6, 165026) I wonder if I have made my point perfectly clear.
('66', 89, 1, 7, 165076) If not, you must write again developing your views.
('66', 89, 1, 8, 165128) The complaint you make about the composition of the Maharashtra Provincial Board is, of course, your own speciality.
('66', 89, 1, 9, 165245) It has nothing to do with propaganda.
('66', 89, 1, 10, 165283) You have simply to get Deodhar to give you a minimum of time or ask him to retire in favour of one who can give the time, or have him as the ornamental head but have a Vice Chairman who would conduct the proceedings and actually organize the work from month to month, and even from day to day.
('66', 89, 1, 11, 165577) If you suggest any such Vice President, I will discuss the thing with Thakkar Bapa in the first instance.
('66', 89, 1, 12, 165683) Now about mill rice and hand pounded rice.
('66', 89, 1, 13, 165726) When you say that mill pounded polished rice is [not] dearer than hand pounded, I know that there is a flaw in your statement.
('66', 89, 1, 14, 165853) Hand pounded rice is as much polished as mill pounded polished rice.
('66', 89, 1, 15, 165922) You have to test the thing for yourself.
('66', 89, 1, 16, 165963) If you will take hand pounded unpolished rice, it would be any day and everywhere cheaper than mill polished rice when we compare the prices of unpolished mill pounded rice and unpolished hand pounded.
('66', 89, 1, 17, 166165) But you will never have the mills to produce unpolished rice in large quantities.
('66', 89, 1, 18, 166247) From the health standpoint, I have universal medical testimony that mill pounded unpolished rice suffers in vitamin when compared with hand pounded unpolished rice.
('66', 89, 1, 19, 166412) To remove the outermost husk is a very simple and expeditious process.
('66', 89, 1, 20, 166483) It is the polishing process by the hand which sends up the price of labour which I obliterate in my calculation because I do not want to go beyond the process of removing the outermost husk.
('66', 89, 1, 21, 166674) Make the investigation for yourself and then give me the prices.
('66', 89, 1, 22, 166739) You are not the only person who have committed the error if you have committed it.
('66', 89, 1, 23, 166822) It is most natural because we have never investigated these processes nor have we ever troubled to know the distinction between polished and unpolished rice.
('66', 89, 1, 24, 166980) Unpolished rice is a most beautiful grain.
('66', 89, 1, 25, 167023) It is either yellow, red or dark white, never white like the polished rice.
('66', 89, 1, 26, 167099) The red variety is the best, and sweet to taste, and cheaper withal.
('66', 89, 1, 27, 167168) I opened out one grain from the paddy and showed to those around me the full
('66', 90, 0, 1, 167245) VOL. 66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 91
('66', 90, 1, 2, 167291) unpolished grain.
('66', 90, 1, 3, 167309) I had not seen it before.
('66', 90, 1, 4, 167335) But in a heap of half polished rice I saw a whole paddy grain.
('66', 90, 1, 5, 167398) I immediately removed the husk with my finger nails.
('66', 90, 1, 6, 167451) Out came the beautiful red grain from its husk.
('66', 90, 1, 7, 167499) I would defy anyone to show that such unpolished rice is dearer than mill polished rice.
('66', 90, 1, 8, 167588) Test again for your satisfaction and then tell me if you still claim to be right in your supposition that polished rice is cheaper than hand pounded unpolished rice.

('66', 90, 6, 13, 167886) MY DEAR SISTER,
('66', 90, 7, 14, 167902) I must dictate if I am to write to you at all today.
('66', 90, 7, 15, 167955) You must not overwork yourself.
('66', 90, 7, 16, 167987) You must give yourself proper rest and build up your body to the extent it is possible.
('66', 90, 7, 17, 168075) As a confirmed believer in the natural mode of living, I think that we can rebuild shattered bodies by conforming to the laws of nature.
('66', 90, 7, 18, 168212) Very often I have known persons who have succeeded in getting better where medical assistance has failed.
('66', 90, 7, 19, 168318) This is no reflection on the doctor brother.
('66', 90, 7, 20, 168363) I hope you got copies of the A.I.V.I.A. constitution and have sent in your form to Kumarappa.
('66', 90, 7, 21, 168457) I would like the Raizada to convince me that it is proper for ourselves to prosecute poor Harijans for breach of the Sarda Act.
('66', 90, 7, 22, 168585) In the mean time, I am certain, we must not undertake these prosecutions.
('66', 90, 7, 23, 168659) Prosecutions must be preceded by educative propaganda.

('66', 91, 4, 5, 168882) I have your letter and the children’s.
('66', 91, 4, 6, 168921) Tangai 1 is a wise girl and so she has learnt to resign herself to the sorrows that come to her.
('66', 91, 4, 7, 169018) 2 The spirit of resignation is bad when sorrows come out of our conscious errors; but when they come for reasons we do not know and cannot know, resignation is the proper thing.
('66', 91, 4, 8, 169196) In other words, constant endeavour and surrender to the will of God have to go hand in hand.
('66', 91, 4, 9, 169289) Your description of your visit to Porto Novo and Maria’s losing herself in her work is very good.
('66', 91, 4, 10, 169387) My feet won’t let me walk, because immediately I try, the crack reopens.
('66', 91, 4, 11, 169460) C. F. Andrews could not write to you as he had no time whatsoever.
('66', 91, 4, 12, 169527) It was touch and go whether he would be able to catch the steamer he did.
('66', 91, 4, 13, 169601) Both A.I.S.A. and A.I.V.I.A. are absolutely non political associations.
('66', 91, 4, 14, 169673) You must come to Wardha some day.
('66', 91, 4, 15, 169707) Delhi is too far for you.

('66', 92, 13, 20, 170951) [On or before January 18, 1935] 1
('66', 92, 14, 21, 170985) Official announcement has been made that the Silver Jubilee of His Britannic Majesty’s reign is to be celebrated in India.
('66', 92, 14, 22, 171108) It is necessary for the Working Committee to guide the public as to the attitude to be adopted on the occasion.
('66', 92, 15, 23, 171220) 1 The Working Committee of the Congress met on January 16 and 18, 1935, during which time Gandhiji had discussions with the Committee and also drafted this resolution in connection with the Silver Jubilee celebrations of the Coronation of King George V
('66', 93, 0, 1, 171473) 94 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 93, 1, 2, 171514) The Congress has and can have nothing but good wishes for the personal well being of His Majesty, but the Congress cannot ignore the fact that the rule in India with which His Majesty is naturally identified has been a positive hindrance to the political, moral and material growth of the nation.
('66', 93, 1, 3, 171811) It now threatens to culminate in a Constitution which, if enforced, promises to exploit the Nation, to drain her of what she still possesses of wealth and to harden her political subjection as has perhaps never been attempted before.
('66', 93, 1, 4, 172045) It is, therefore, impossible for the Working Committee to advise any participation in the forthcoming celebrations.
('66', 93, 1, 5, 172161) At the same time, the Working Committee has no desire by hostile demonstrations to wound the susceptibilities of Englishmen and others who will want to take part in the celebrations.
('66', 93, 1, 6, 172344) The Working Committee therefore, advises the general public, including Congressmen who may be members of elected bodies, to be satisfied with mere abstention from the events that may be arranged for celebration.
('66', 93, 1, 7, 172556) The Working Committee trusts that the authorities and responsible Englishmen will recognize and appreciate the honest and inevitable attitude of the Working Committee and refrain from unnecessarily wounding national self respect by compelling, directly or indirectly, participation in the forthcoming celebrations.

('66', 93, 5, 11, 172969) MY DEAR MURIEL,
('66', 93, 6, 12, 172985) You have been moving from place to place with such rapidity that I have not known where to send you my letters.
('66', 93, 6, 13, 173097) Hence my silence.
('66', 93, 6, 14, 173115) I believe that I have received all the letters you have written — not more than four, not less than three.
('66', 93, 6, 15, 173222) Of three I have a distinct recollection.
('66', 93, 6, 16, 173263) I have forwarded your cheque to Thakkar Bapa for Harijan funds.
('66', 93, 6, 17, 173327) I am dictating this letter in Delhi where I have come in order to pass a few days at the Harijan Home for which Shri Ghanshyamdas Birla has donated 20 acres of land costing Rs. 30,000. I am living on

('66', 94, 1, 2, 173573) that piece of ground.
('66', 94, 1, 3, 173595) I expect to return to Wardha on the 28th instant, at the latest.
('66', 94, 1, 4, 173660) You see I have not yet gone to jail, and you can depend upon my not forcing the pace.
('66', 94, 1, 5, 173746) My application for permission to go to the Frontier Province has been turned down.
('66', 94, 1, 6, 173829) That, of course, is not the last word.
('66', 94, 1, 7, 173868) Even if you do not hear from me, you have to continue to write.
('66', 94, 1, 8, 173932) Love from us all.

('66', 94, 5, 12, 174034) DELHI, January 18, 1935
('66', 94, 6, 13, 174058) DEAR LALA DUNICHAND, I have your letter with the enclosure.
('66', 94, 6, 14, 174118) I have glanced through it.
('66', 94, 6, 15, 174145) It was unnecessary, in my opinion, to publish it.
('66', 94, 6, 16, 174195) Dr. Satyapal needs no defence from you; and if he does, I think your letter has spoiled his case.
('66', 94, 6, 17, 174293) Public workers have to possess the hide of a rhinoceros.
('66', 94, 6, 18, 174350) They cannot afford to be sensitive to the extent of being thin skinned.
('66', 94, 6, 19, 174422) But I must confess to you that though I have not talked to more than two or three persons and that too when the talk became relevant, I have laid the blame of the Punjab defeats at Dr. Satyapal’s door.
('66', 94, 6, 20, 174624) His inexhaustible energy, courage and suffering are undeniable.
('66', 94, 6, 21, 174688) But he has a knack of often estranging good people from him.
('66', 94, 6, 22, 174749) I intended to talk to him about it, but unfortunately he went to jail before I could do so.
('66', 94, 6, 23, 174841) It is my opinion that if Dr. Satyapal had been wise and judicious, not one of the Punjab seats would have been lost.
('66', 94, 7, 24, 174958) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI LALA DUNICHAND, B.A. KRIPA NIVAS AMBALA CITY

('66', 95, 1, 2, 175102) 124. LETTER TO JAGDISH SHASTRI January 19, 1935 BHAI JAGDISH SHASTRI,
('66', 95, 2, 3, 175172) A list of the chapters of the essay on cow protection is enclosed herewith.
('66', 95, 2, 4, 175248) You can add to it, you may even change the order.
('66', 95, 2, 5, 175298) 1. Origin of cow protection.
('66', 95, 2, 6, 175327) 2. The position in the Vedic Age.
('66', 95, 2, 7, 175361) 3. The position in the Age of the Smritis.
('66', 95, 2, 8, 175404) 4. The position in the Age of the Epics.
('66', 95, 2, 9, 175445) 5. The attitude of other religions.
('66', 95, 2, 10, 175481) 6. Origin of dispute with the Muslims.
('66', 95, 2, 11, 175520) 7. Is cow protection an essential feature of Hinduism?
('66', 95, 2, 12, 175575) If it is, then what does it signify?
('66', 95, 2, 13, 175612) Does the tradition date back to the ancient times?
('66', 95, 2, 14, 175663) Difference between the attitudes of the Arya Samajists and sanatanists and its critical appreciation.
('66', 95, 2, 15, 175765) 8. The present position—census of goshalas.
('66', 95, 2, 16, 175809) Difference between Jain pinjarapoles and Marwari goshalas and feasibility of cow protection through them.

('66', 95, 4, 19, 175977) 125. SPEECH AT SANSI BASTI, DELHI January 19, 1935 I had promised to Thakkar Bapa that I would visit this Harijan Colony some time for half an hour.
('66', 95, 4, 20, 176126) Today I have the opportunity to come here.
('66', 95, 4, 21, 176169) It is deplorable that first Hindu society has sinned against these Sansi brethren, regarding them as untouchables and then the Government on its part has declared them a criminal tribe.
('66', 95, 4, 22, 176355) It is a matter of shame for us Hindus that because of negligence on our part these people were left without work, and since they must make a living some of them adopted crime as a profession.
('66', 95, 4, 23, 176547) But not every one of them is a criminal, nor can it be so.
('66', 95, 4, 24, 176606) Nevertheless the whole community came to be called a criminal tribe.
('66', 95, 4, 25, 176675) I would ask the Sansi brethren to eschew the evil that has crept into their midst due to our indifference.
('66', 95, 4, 26, 176782) You should give up drink and gambling, and carrion too, if anyone takes it.
('66', 95, 4, 27, 176858) You should also give up stealing, etc., so that you can be recommended for exemption from reporting at police stations.
('66', 95, 4, 28, 176978) May God grant you the good sense to follow my advice.

('66', 96, 3, 4, 177184) He was taken upstairs as soon as Gandhiji was free to see him.
('66', 96, 3, 5, 177247) The neatly dressed old man placed before Gandhiji ten neatly arranged wads of currency notes and said: “This is for the poorest and the most deserving.
('66', 96, 3, 6, 177399) You know them better than anyone else.” [GANDHIJI:] That’s very good.
('66', 96, 3, 7, 177469) But how many years’ savings does this mean?
('66', 96, 4, 8, 177513) Many years.
('66', 96, 4, 9, 177525) But I sent a hundred for the earthquake and a hundred to Assam, and in Allahabad four years ago I gave Rs. 500 for the peasants.
('66', 96, 4, 10, 177654) Oh, then tell me what was your salary and what is your pension?
('66', 96, 4, 11, 177718) And what were you?
('66', 96, 5, 12, 177737) I was a schoolmaster.
('66', 96, 5, 13, 177759) When I retired after many years’ service, my salary was Rs. 52 a month.
('66', 96, 5, 14, 177831) I get no pension, but I was given a gratuity of Rs. 2,700. And how long ago did you retire?
('66', 96, 6, 15, 177923) Five years ago.
('66', 96, 6, 16, 177939) And how much do you spend on your own living?
('66', 96, 7, 17, 177985) Oh, my living!
('66', 96, 7, 18, 178000) Hardly much.
('66', 96, 7, 19, 178013) But still one has to live.
('66', 96, 7, 20, 178040) Tell me how much you need.
('66', 96, 8, 21, 178067) A little dal roti does not cost much.
('66', 96, 8, 22, 178105) I can do with Rs. 10 a month.
('66', 96, 8, 23, 178135) I have no one to take care of.
('66', 96, 8, 24, 178166) I used to have nephews whom I supported and educated, but now I am free.
('66', 96, 8, 25, 178239) I have also a Sanskrit school to which I devote most of my time now.
('66', 96, 8, 26, 178308) It is a free school.
('66', 96, 8, 27, 178329) So you saved a few thousands out of your small salary and have been devoting it to the service of the poor.
('66', 96, 8, 28, 178437) A great thing.
('66', 96, 8, 29, 178452) How I wish everyone could learn the art from you.
('66', 96, 9, 30, 178502) Yes, Mahatmaji, I have spent very little on myself and I have often been able to give away what I had to the poor.
('66', 96, 10, 31, 178617) Admiring his padded clothing, which did not need to be supplemented by shawls or blankets, Gandhiji asked: And where did you get this khadi?
('66', 96, 11, 32, 178758) It is home made khadi.
('66', 96, 11, 33, 178781) You make me envy you.
('66', 96, 12, 34, 178803) “I have still some savings left, Mahatmaji,” said the old man, his face suffused
('66', 96, 13, 35, 178884) 1 According to Mahadev Desai’s “Weekly Notes”, from which this has been extracted, the discussion took place on the day on which Gandhiji spoke at Jamia Millia; vide the following item.

('66', 97, 1, 4, 179177) I do not know where to give the money.
('66', 97, 1, 5, 179216) I know you, and you know the poorest who deserve help.
('66', 97, 1, 6, 179271) I am deeply thankful.”

('66', 97, 4, 9, 179349) January 19, 1935 2
('66', 97, 5, 10, 179368) I do not know whether, while you listened to the story unfolded by the Begum Saheba, you were, like me, drawing a comparison between the history of Turkey and India.
('66', 97, 5, 11, 179534) I could not fail to draw many a parallel between the two stories.
('66', 97, 5, 12, 179600) No birth comes without agony, and as I listened to the story, not yet finished by the speaker, and not yet finished in action, I found that all is in the melting pot, all is transitory in this transitory world.
('66', 97, 5, 13, 179811) One could not say what would be the end of the world in which Turkey and India were but insignificant spots.
('66', 97, 5, 14, 179920) But it is best to know that what matters to India and to everybody is his or her own individual action.
('66', 97, 5, 15, 180024) For we must know that true history is not the history of kings and dynasties, but of individual men and women in general.
('66', 97, 5, 16, 180146) Some who died in utter neglect and misery were great heroes and heroines, not great kings, however big the empires they had founded and whatever the destruction they wrought on the face of the earth.
('66', 97, 5, 17, 180346) 3 The history of man and woman is still in the making.
('66', 97, 5, 18, 180401) What are a thousand or even a million years in the limitless cycle of time?
('66', 97, 5, 19, 180477) They are but a speck, and as I listened to the story of Turkey, I derived hope that, if we modelled our action according to the Right and nothing but the Right, there would be nothing but a bright future for us all.
('66', 97, 5, 20, 180693) There is an indissoluble tie that binds India to Turkey, not because we have suffered alike, but because Turkey has a Muslim population which has so much in common with India because of her millions of Muslims, who are flesh of our flesh and blood of our blood and bone of our bone.
('66', 97, 5, 21, 180976) May Begum Saheba’s coming in our

('66', 98, 5, 6, 181585) BHAI ANAND SWARUP 1,
('66', 98, 6, 7, 181606) Do come, except on Monday.
('66', 98, 6, 8, 181633) You will be shown the new way of plying the takli.
('66', 98, 6, 9, 181684) I shall give you a few minutes if possible.
('66', 98, 6, 10, 181728) It takes half an hour to teach the new way to those who bring their own takli.
('66', 98, 6, 11, 181807) Afterwards it is only a matter of practice.
('66', 98, 6, 12, 181851) You can come on or before the 27th.

('66', 98, 10, 16, 182057) [Before January 21, 1935] 2
('66', 98, 11, 17, 182085) She talked of her experience of the British slums and put in a strong plea for the “poor woman” who had to submit to the strong man.
('66', 98, 11, 18, 182218) [GANDHIJI:] There is no poor woman.
('66', 98, 11, 19, 182254) Poor woman is mightier than man, and I am quite prepared to demonstrate it to you if you come to the villages of India.
('66', 98, 11, 20, 182374) Any woman there would tell you that, if she did not want it, there was no man born of woman who could compel her.
('66', 98, 11, 21, 182488) I can say this from my own experience in relation to my wife, and mine is no solitary instance.
('66', 98, 11, 22, 182584) If the will to die rather than to yield is there, no monster can make the woman yield.
('66', 98, 11, 23, 182671) No, it is a mutual affair.
('66', 98, 11, 24, 182698) Men and women both are a mixture of the brute and the divine, and if we can subdue the brute, it is well and good.
('66', 98, 12, 25, 182813) But what is the woman to do, if the man for the sake of not having more children goes to another woman?
('66', 98, 12, 26, 182917) So now you are shifting your own ground.

('66', 99, 1, 2, 183213) your premises, you are bound to come to wrong conclusions.
('66', 99, 1, 3, 183272) Don’t assume things and try to unman man and unwoman woman.
('66', 99, 1, 4, 183332) Let me understand the basis of your gospel.
('66', 99, 1, 5, 183376) When I said your birth control propaganda was sufficient introduction, there was some seriousness behind the joke, for I know that there are some men and women who think that in birth control lies our salvation.
('66', 99, 1, 6, 183588) Let me, therefore, understand the basis from you.
('66', 99, 2, 7, 183638) I do not see in it the salvation of the world, but what I say is that without some form of birth control there is no salvation.
('66', 99, 2, 8, 183766) You would do it in one way, I would do it in another.
('66', 99, 2, 9, 183820) I advocate your method as well, but not in all cases.
('66', 99, 2, 10, 183874) You seem to regard a beautiful function as something objectionable.
('66', 99, 2, 11, 183942) Two animals are nearest to the divine when they are going to create new life.
('66', 99, 2, 12, 184020) There is something very beautiful in the act.
('66', 99, 2, 13, 184066) Here again you are labouring under a confusion.
('66', 99, 2, 14, 184114) The creation of a new life is nearest the divine, I agree.
('66', 99, 2, 15, 184173) All I want is that one shouldapproach that act in a divine way.
('66', 99, 2, 16, 184237) That is to say, man and woman must come together with no other desire than that of creating a new life.
('66', 99, 2, 17, 184341) But if they come together merely to have a fond embrace, they are nearest the devil.
('66', 99, 2, 18, 184426) Man unfortunately forgets that he is nearest the divine, hankers after the brute instinct in himself and becomes less than the brute.
('66', 99, 3, 19, 184560) But why must you cast aspersion on the brute?
('66', 99, 4, 20, 184606) I do not.
('66', 99, 4, 21, 184616) The brute fulfils the law of his own nature.
('66', 99, 4, 22, 184661) The lion in his majesty is a noble creature and he has a perfect right to eat me up, but I have none to develop paws and pounce upon you.
('66', 99, 4, 23, 184799) Then I lower myself and become worse than the brute.
('66', 99, 5, 24, 184852) I am sorry.
('66', 99, 5, 25, 184864) I have expressed myself very badly.
('66', 99, 5, 26, 184900) I confess that in a majority of cases it is not going to be their salvation, but a factor which will conduce to higher life.
('66', 99, 5, 27, 185025) You understand what I mean, though I am afraid I have not been able to make myself quite clear.
('66', 99, 5, 28, 185121) Oh, no.
('66', 99, 5, 29, 185129) I do not want to take any undue advantage of you.
('66', 99, 5, 30, 185179) But I want you to understand my view point.
('66', 99, 5, 31, 185223) Do not run away with misconceptions.
('66', 99, 5, 32, 185260) Man must choose either of the two courses, the upward or the downward, but as he has the brute in him, he will more easily choose the downward course than the upward, especially when the downward course is presented to him in a beautiful garb.
('66', 99, 5, 33, 185504) Man easily capitulates when sin is presented in the garb of virtue, and that is what Marie Stopes 1 and others are doing.
('66', 99, 5, 34, 185626) If I were to popularize the

('66', 100, 1, 2, 185841) religion of indulgence, I know that men would simply clutch at it.
('66', 100, 1, 3, 185908) I know that, if people like you in selfless zeal cried themselves hoarse upholding your doctrine, you might even ride to apparent victory, but I also know that you will ride to certain death, of course totally unconscious of the mischief you are doing.
('66', 100, 1, 4, 186161) The downward instinct requires no advocacy, no argument.
('66', 100, 1, 5, 186218) It is there embodied in them, and unless you regulate and control it, there is danger of disease and pestilence.
('66', 100, 2, 6, 186331) Mrs. Howe Martyn, who until now seemed to accept the distinction between the divine and the devilish, contended that there was really none and that they were much more allied than people imagined.
('66', 100, 2, 7, 186528) So you think the devil and the divine are the same?
('66', 100, 2, 8, 186580) Do you believe in the sun?
('66', 100, 2, 9, 186607) And if you do, don’t you think you must believe in the shadow?
('66', 100, 3, 10, 186670) Why should you call ‘shadow’ devil?
('66', 100, 4, 11, 186706) You may call it ‘no God’, if you like.
('66', 100, 5, 12, 186745) I do not think there is no God in the shadow.
('66', 100, 5, 13, 186791) There is life every where.
('66', 100, 6, 14, 186818) There is a thing like absence of life.
('66', 100, 6, 15, 186857) Do you know that Hindus will reduce the body of the dearest one to ashes as soon as life in it is extinct?
('66', 100, 6, 16, 186964) There is an essential unity in all life, but there is diversity, too, and one has to penetrate it and find the unity behind—but not by intellect, as you are trying to do.
('66', 100, 6, 17, 187135) Where there is truth, there must be untruth; where there is light, there must be shadow.
('66', 100, 6, 18, 187224) You cannot realize the wider consciousness, unless you subordinate completely reason and intellect, and the body, too.
('66', 100, 7, 19, 187343) Mrs. Howe Martyn looked puzzled, and time was fast running against her.
('66', 100, 7, 20, 187415) But Gandhiji said:
('66', 100, 8, 21, 187434) I am prepared to give you more time.
('66', 100, 8, 22, 187471) But for that you must come to Wardha and stay with me.
('66', 100, 8, 23, 187526) I am as great an enthusiast as you, and you must not leave India until you have converted me or converted yourself.

('66', 101, 2, 4, 187825) You shall be your own judge as to the enforcement of rules 9 and 10 1 in your own person.
('66', 101, 2, 5, 187915) What I expect you to do is not a visit to every village in your district, but acquisition of a right knowledge of the villagers’ wants and organization of the effort to meet them.
('66', 101, 2, 6, 188095) For this you are fully fitted in spite of your dilapidated body of which we must talk when we meet.
('66', 101, 2, 7, 188195) I leave on 28th which is my silence day.
('66', 101, 2, 8, 188236) Come if you easily can between 26 and 27 The cold spell has meant more than the loss of a crore of rupees for the starving millions.

('66', 101, 6, 12, 188492) I think you should discuss everything but making it clear that you have no mandate 2. You could only convey the purport of the conversations to the Committee 3 and its decision.
('66', 101, 6, 13, 188670) It should be strictly understood that though you would meet as representatives, the talks must be regarded as informal till they reach the stage of some concrete proposal to be discussed by the respective committees.

('66', 103, 3, 4, 191051) AMBUJAM 1,
('66', 103, 4, 5, 191062) Your letter to hand.
('66', 103, 4, 6, 191083) I think that the parental affection was there all the while.
('66', 103, 4, 7, 191144) Only you were not ready to want or receive it.
('66', 103, 4, 8, 191191) Anyway now that you feel the warmth of it, you should never let it cool down.
('66', 103, 4, 9, 191269) The best way is not to resist them.
('66', 103, 4, 10, 191305) Resistance may become a duty when obedience has been implicitly volunteered and cheerfully rendered in a systematic manner.
('66', 103, 4, 11, 191429) Knowing as I do both Father and Mother I cannot imagine any occasion when you might have to cross their path.
('66', 103, 4, 12, 191539) Their one concern is to see you and help you to be happy.
('66', 103, 4, 13, 191597) I tried to sound Ba.
('66', 103, 4, 14, 191618) She does not like the idea of leaving me just now even for a few days.
('66', 103, 4, 15, 191689) But I shall tempt her again, though I do not expect success.
('66', 103, 4, 16, 191750) You may write to her.
('66', 103, 4, 17, 191772) Vasumati can come when you are quite ready.
('66', 103, 4, 18, 191816) The name of the ashram may be Sevashramam or Sevi kashramam.
('66', 103, 4, 19, 191877) You know the distinction.
('66', 103, 4, 20, 191903) I think you should not worry about your husband.
('66', 103, 4, 21, 191952) Think of him purely as a friend.
('66', 103, 4, 22, 191985) Let Father and Mother do what they think is proper.
('66', 103, 4, 23, 192037) When you know that you can render no help, where is the use of worrying?
('66', 103, 4, 24, 192110) If you were of any service in bringing him to his senses, it would be your primary duty to look after him and set aside every other task.
('66', 103, 4, 25, 192248) But I have understood that this is not possible.
('66', 103, 4, 26, 192297) Hence my advice to you to forget him altogether and devote your whole energy to such service as it is possible for you to render.
('66', 103, 4, 27, 192427) You should learn to derive joy from service.
('66', 103, 4, 28, 192472) Universal selfless service absolves one from special service.
('66', 103, 4, 29, 192534) For the greater includes the less.
('66', 103, 4, 30, 192569) Of course one has to be careful to see that there is no selfishness behind universal service.
('66', 103, 4, 31, 192663) It must be self evident.
('66', 103, 4, 32, 192688) These are my views.
('66', 103, 4, 33, 192708) But I advise you to discuss this matter freely with Father and Mother and be guided by them.
('66', 103, 4, 34, 192801) You must get rid of constipation.
('66', 103, 4, 35, 192835) It generally means more proteid than necessary.
('66', 103, 4, 36, 192883) You may therefore omit dhall and then if necessary reduce the quantity of milk or curds.
('66', 103, 4, 37, 192972) What bhaji are you taking?
('66', 103, 4, 38, 192999) Palak or luni is excellent.

('66', 104, 10, 13, 193455) I was delighted to have your letter and to find that Ambujam was giving you both satisfaction and that you were interesting yourselves in her mission of service.
('66', 104, 10, 14, 193617) If she settles down to it, I am sure her moroseness will go and she will have an ennobling occupation.
('66', 104, 10, 15, 193720) Please dismiss from your mind the thought that Ambujam can ever be a burden on my mind.
('66', 104, 10, 16, 193808) It is a matter of deep joy to me that I enjoy your confidence and her affection.
('66', 104, 10, 17, 193889) I draw no distinction between such personal service and public service.

('66', 106, 10, 24, 196439) I disposed of your letter soon.
('66', 106, 10, 25, 196471) We are bound to have such experiences.
('66', 106, 10, 26, 196510) When you are all right, write to me from time to time about the developments.
('66', 106, 10, 27, 196588) For the present at any rate let us not take the matter to the Press.
('66', 106, 10, 28, 196657) I have suggested to Jamnalalji to solve the question at a domestic level.
('66', 106, 10, 29, 196731) Let me know if anything has happened since then.
('66', 106, 10, 30, 196780) Keep Jamnalalji also informed about it.
('66', 106, 10, 31, 196820) Even if the police do not give us the number, we may answer them as often as they may ask us.

('66', 107, 1, 2, 197089) they came to question me seven or eight times.
('66', 107, 1, 3, 197136) Since I looked like a fakir, there was no question of their enquiring about my name, although they would persistently ask for my ticket number.
('66', 107, 1, 4, 197280) When I reached Madras their vehicle would invariably follow mine.
('66', 107, 1, 5, 197346) Others used to be annoyed; I was only amused.
('66', 107, 1, 6, 197392) The law says that people are in duty bound to give their name, address, etc., to the police as often as they might ask for them.
('66', 107, 1, 7, 197521) When we are fighting we may do anything that the rules permit.

('66', 107, 5, 14, 197836) January 21, 1935
('66', 107, 6, 15, 197853) QUESTION: When do you think you will be able to give an actual start to the work of the Village Industries Association?
('66', 107, 7, 16, 197973) GANDHIJI: It is difficult to say what is meant by start.
('66', 107, 7, 17, 198030) But if by it is meant actual work through different agencies in villages, I am unable to fix the exact date, because we are moving very cautiously— cautiously in the sense that we do not want to make any mistakes so long as it is possible to avoid them—because of the varied nature of the work to be done.
('66', 107, 7, 18, 198336) This work is like sailing on an uncharted sea.
('66', 107, 7, 19, 198383) The Central Board is meeting in Wardha on the 1st of the next month, when perhaps a definite step will be taken.
('66', 107, 7, 20, 198496) Meanwhile, not a moment has been lost.
('66', 107, 7, 21, 198535) We have been collecting valuable information, and we are having promises of support from many quarters.
('66', 107, 8, 22, 198639) Q. Do you intend to start branches of the Association in all the provinces simultaneously, or do you intend to make a beginning in a few selected places?
('66', 107, 8, 23, 198793) Which will be the headquarters of the Association?
('66', 107, 8, 24, 198844) Will a branch be established here before you leave?
('66', 107, 9, 25, 198896) G. We aim at having no branches, but agencies all over India, the ideal being to have as many agents as there are villages, so as to ensure

('66', 108, 1, 2, 199135) perfect distribution of work.
('66', 108, 1, 3, 199165) The secret of success of this effort lies in decentralization.
('66', 108, 1, 4, 199228) I do not know if an agency will be formally established in Delhi before I leave.
('66', 108, 1, 5, 199309) But I am collecting all the information that is available.
('66', 108, 1, 6, 199368) The final appointment will be made by the Central Board.
('66', 108, 1, 7, 199425) The headquarters are in Wardha, where Seth Jamnalalji has given a valuable garden with a large bungalow in it, and he has promised more land, if it is required for subsequent arrange ments.
('66', 108, 2, 8, 199615) Q. Is the Association likely to depend on its unaided strength for all information, statistical or otherwise, in respect of the dead or dying industries you seek to revive, or will it invite the co operation of all official and non official agencies operating in India at Present?
('66', 108, 3, 9, 199896) G. The Association will do nothing unaided, so vast is the work to be done.
('66', 108, 3, 10, 199972) Therefore it will invite and receive co operation of all agencies, not excluding the official agencies.
('66', 108, 4, 11, 200076) Q. Will the Association seek to revive only those industries whose revival is not reasonably calculated to come in conflict with the various world economic and commercial forces now acting and reacting on India; or will the Association try to revive the dead industries irrespective of such considerations and merely because in their ancient flourishing condition they used to give food to millions of villages?
('66', 108, 5, 12, 200488) G. The Association will certainly seek to revive and encourage as many industries as are necessary for the moral and material growth of village life.
('66', 108, 5, 13, 200638) It will not be deterred by the so called conflicting world forces.
('66', 108, 6, 14, 200705) Q. It is generally agreed that the cotton mills of India have not taken very kindly to the khadi industry.
('66', 108, 6, 15, 200812) If the Association attempts to resuscitate those dead, dying or unorganized industries which are likely to clash with the interests of more organized, indigenous industries, is it not your apprehension that the Association will meet with opposition?
('66', 108, 7, 16, 201062) G. It is likely that the Association will meet with opposition from mechanized industries, such as sugar mills, rice mills and flour mills.
('66', 108, 7, 17, 201202) It is for us to find a way out of the difficulty.
('66', 108, 7, 18, 201252) I have every hope that we shall be able to overcome these difficulties.
('66', 108, 8, 19, 201324) Q. Take, for instance, the question of sugar versus gur.
('66', 108, 8, 20, 201381) Sugar is a protected industry and is now fairly well organized.
('66', 108, 8, 21, 201445) It was stated in the Press some time ago that the Association will try to increase the consumption of gur.
('66', 108, 8, 22, 201552) If it is true, do you not think that by doing so it will evoke the opposition of the sugar industry?
('66', 108, 9, 23, 201653) G. That may be so.
('66', 108, 9, 24, 201672) If the consumption of gur increases and the consumption of sugar decreases, it would be a blessing for India, because medical testimony goes to show that gur is superior to sugar

('66', 109, 1, 2, 201893) in nutritive value; and it is the business of the Association, as also of the public, to see to it that no mechanized industry is allowed to interfere with the health of the people.
('66', 109, 2, 3, 202075) Q. May I have your views on whether or not the Association should supplement the existing large scale industries, without antagonizing them?
('66', 109, 3, 4, 202216) G. The answer to it has already been given.
('66', 109, 4, 5, 202260) Q. Am I wrong in suggesting that, from the resuscitation of dead village industries, such as you contemplate, to the industrialization of India on human, rational and intelligent lines (as opposed to greedy capitalism), it is but a step?
('66', 109, 5, 6, 202498) G. I do not know if a vast country like India, with her millions of people having four months of enforced idleness on their hand, can afford to have large scale industries and yet live a life of tolerable comfort.
('66', 109, 5, 7, 202712) Large scale, centralized industries in India, except such industries as cannot be possibly carried on in villages, must mean starvation of millions, unless honourable employment is found for the displaced millions.
('66', 109, 6, 8, 202927) Q. If what the Press says about the Government circulars 1 forestalling the activities of the Village Industries Association is true, do you think there is any chance of the Association coming in conflict with the Government?
('66', 109, 7, 9, 203153) G. There is no possibility of the Association coming in conflict with Government, because the ideal that the Association has set before it appears to me to be different from that of the Government effort if I have understood it rightly, except, perhaps, in the matter of sanitation.
('66', 109, 7, 10, 203436) We should certainly not take up the work of sanitation in villages where the Government agencies might be doing it.
('66', 109, 7, 11, 203552) There is no idea whatsoever to supplant the Government agency.
('66', 109, 7, 12, 203615) It may be to supplement the work.
('66', 109, 8, 13, 203649) Q. I suppose you have read the Government circular.
('66', 109, 9, 14, 203701) G. Yes.
('66', 109, 10, 15, 203709) Q. You must have noticed that the Government suspect that through this Association you will have greater opportunities of coming in closer contact with the villages, which you will utilize to prepare for organizing civil disobedience on a far more gigantic scale.
('66', 109, 11, 16, 203973) G. It never crossed my mind; I have never worked it in that indirect fashion.
('66', 109, 11, 17, 204051) It would defeat the very end that I have in view.
('66', 109, 11, 18, 204101) I want the material and moral growth of the villages for itself, and if it is achieved, it would be a full satisfaction of my ambition.

('66', 110, 1, 2, 204324) Similarly, if ever I should have to organize civil disobedience, it would be organized independently of any other activity.
('66', 110, 1, 3, 204448) If full effect is given to the word “civil”, all this suspicion should be dispelled.
('66', 110, 1, 4, 204533) But I have patience enough, and I am convinced that, if what I have said is true, all the suspicion will be dispelled without any further effort on my part.
('66', 110, 2, 5, 204690) Q. I. would ask another question.
('66', 110, 2, 6, 204724) You said that you could show a miracle if Government understood the spirit of your village industries scheme and lent its help to you.
('66', 110, 2, 7, 204859) What do you mean by help?
('66', 110, 2, 8, 204885) Is it financial assistance?
('66', 110, 3, 9, 204913) G. I simply say that, if Government understand the secret of my methods and give me complete co operation in the work I am doing, I undertake to show miracles.
('66', 110, 3, 10, 205073) I do not want financial co operation.
('66', 110, 3, 11, 205111) I want moral, enthusiastic endorsement from Government.

('66', 110, 8, 15, 205259) Panditji 2 writes to me that you have exceeded all limits.
('66', 110, 8, 16, 205318) You have been incurring debts in spite of your good income and you also steal.
('66', 110, 8, 17, 205397) You behave as it pleases your own sweet will.
('66', 110, 8, 18, 205443) If all this is true, it is painful.
('66', 110, 8, 19, 205479) You would remember what I had told you in Bombay.
('66', 110, 8, 20, 205529) You had taken a pledge before me not to practise deceit—do you remember?
('66', 110, 8, 21, 205602) Panditji is likely to reach there in a day or two.
('66', 110, 8, 22, 205653) Wake up from your swoon and see that you do not tarnish Panditji’s reputation and that of the Ashram.
('66', 110, 8, 23, 205755) Remember your promises.
('66', 110, 8, 24, 205779) Satisfy Panditji.
('66', 110, 8, 25, 205797) Write to me in detail.
('66', 110, 8, 26, 205820) Wrongdoing is not as great a sin as trying to hide it.
('66', 110, 8, 27, 205875) We all sin but one who confesses and wipes it away is sure to be blessed.

('66', 111, 1, 2, 206199) 143. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 1
('66', 111, 2, 3, 206228) [About January 23, 1935] 2
('66', 111, 3, 4, 206255) I have been asked by Sir S. Radhakrishnan to answer the following three questions: (1) What is your religion?
('66', 111, 3, 5, 206365) (2) How are you led to it?
('66', 111, 3, 6, 206392) (3) What is its bearing on social life?
('66', 111, 3, 7, 206432) My religion is Hinduism which, for me, is religion of humanity and includes the best of all the religions known to me.
('66', 111, 3, 8, 206551) I take it that the present tense in the second question has been purposely used instead of the past.
('66', 111, 3, 9, 206652) I am being led to my religion through Truth and Non violence, i.e., love in the broadest sense.
('66', 111, 3, 10, 206748) I often describe my religion as religion of Truth.
('66', 111, 3, 11, 206799) Of late, instead of saying God is Truth I have been saying Truth is God, in order more fully to define my religion.
('66', 111, 3, 12, 206915) I used at one time to know by heart the thousand names of God which a booklet in Hinduism gives in verse form and which perhaps tens of thousands recite every morning.
('66', 111, 3, 13, 207083) But nowadays nothing so completely describes my God as Truth.
('66', 111, 3, 14, 207145) Denial of God we have known.
('66', 111, 3, 15, 207174) Denial of Truth we have not known 3. The most ignorant among mankind have some truth in them.
('66', 111, 3, 16, 207268) We are all sparks of Truth.
('66', 111, 3, 17, 207296) The sum total of these sparks is indescribable, as yet Unknown Truth, which is God.
('66', 111, 3, 18, 207380) I am being daily led nearer to it by constant prayer.
('66', 111, 3, 19, 207434) The bearing of this religion on social life is, or has to be, seen in one’s daily social contact.
('66', 111, 3, 20, 207532) To be true to such religion one has to lose oneself in continuous and continuing service of all life.
('66', 111, 3, 21, 207634) Realization of Truth is impossible without a complete merging of oneself in and identification with this limitless ocean of life.
('66', 111, 3, 22, 207764) Hence, for me, there is no escape from social service; there is no happiness on earth beyond or apart from it.
('66', 111, 3, 23, 207875) Social service here must be taken to include every department of life.
('66', 111, 3, 24, 207946) In this scheme there is nothing low, nothing high.
('66', 111, 3, 25, 207997) For all is 4 one, though we seem 5 to be many.

('66', 111, 5, 27, 208079) 1 The questions and answers have also been reproduced in F. Mary Barr’s Bapu, International Book House, Bombay, 1949, with slight variations.
('66', 111, 5, 28, 208221) 2 According to Mary Barr Radhakrishnan’s questions came at the time when Gandhiji was about to set out on a village tour from Delhi where he was camping.
('66', 111, 5, 29, 208375) This Gandhiji did on January 23, 1935. 3 Mary Barr’s version does not include this sentence and the one preceding.

('66', 112, 2, 3, 208621) January 23, 1935
('66', 112, 4, 4, 208638) I got your letter yesterday evening.
('66', 112, 4, 5, 208675) Devdas had told me nothing earlier.
('66', 112, 4, 6, 208711) Yesterday I aked him about it and learnt that he had told me nothing because he had wished to spare me.
('66', 112, 4, 7, 208815) He had spoken to Mahadev yesterday morning.
('66', 112, 4, 8, 208859) I have passed on your letter to Devdas so that he can study it in the context of your earlier letters and guide me accordingly.
('66', 112, 4, 9, 208987) Since Mahadev had come to know everything before I did he will read this.
('66', 112, 4, 10, 209061) He has not read your letter received yesterday.
('66', 112, 4, 11, 209109) Have no fears about your letters.
('66', 112, 4, 12, 209143) No one will read anything surreptitiously without my permission.
('66', 112, 4, 13, 209208) Nor have I around me anyone who would do such a thing.
('66', 112, 4, 14, 209263) But I do wish you would learn to shed this reserve soon.
('66', 112, 4, 15, 209320) This reserve is an obstruction to your progress.
('66', 112, 4, 16, 209369) But then I would of course not insist on it.
('66', 112, 4, 17, 209414) The alliance you contemplate is not a great shock to me.
('66', 112, 4, 18, 209471) I shall surely not be shocked if you choose your partner from Kerala.
('66', 112, 4, 19, 209541) I have only to examine the reason for your choice.
('66', 112, 4, 20, 209592) We have to think whether you can do anything staying in Ramachandran’s house.
('66', 112, 4, 21, 209670) It is not proper to decide this question or your future programme on the basis of your letter.
('66', 112, 4, 22, 209765) It no doubt involves some expense but I wish you to come to Wardha and see me.
('66', 112, 4, 23, 209844) I shall arrive there on the 29th evening.
('66', 112, 4, 24, 209886) It will do if you come on the morning of the same day.
('66', 112, 4, 25, 209941) This letter will reach you only on Saturday morning, not leaving you much time.
('66', 112, 4, 26, 210021) You have no reason to be uneasy.
('66', 112, 4, 27, 210054) I am not likely to forsake you.
('66', 112, 4, 28, 210086) I trust you.
('66', 112, 4, 29, 210099) You have found the noble company of Maganbhai, Kaka, etc.
('66', 112, 4, 30, 210157) You have respect for Devdas.
('66', 112, 4, 31, 210186) You yearn for my blessings.
('66', 112, 4, 32, 210214) All will surely be well with you.
('66', 112, 4, 33, 210248) I am writing this before the prayers.

('66', 113, 3, 4, 210555) BHAI MAMA,
('66', 113, 4, 5, 210566) Shouldn’t we say that you are but a luckless fellow?
('66', 113, 4, 6, 210619) I had your letters all right and I had also replied to them.
('66', 113, 4, 7, 210680) The answer to your first is Congress; the second I had asked Mahadev to answer.
('66', 113, 4, 8, 210760) As I am short of time and so that you may have it promptly here is my answer to your third.
('66', 113, 4, 9, 210852) Your treatment should consist of water cure, hip bath, sitz bath; but in your diet you should have milk, uncooked vegetables and wheat.
('66', 113, 4, 10, 210988) The sun bath should be had with full exposure of the body.
('66', 113, 4, 11, 211047) And rest.
('66', 113, 4, 12, 211057) Your health must improve.

('66', 113, 4, 14, 211097) I discontinued my [daily] walks because I developed cracks on the skin of my feet owing to the cold and partly also owing to carelessness on my part.

('66', 113, 7, 21, 211483) 146. HOW TO BEGIN?
('66', 113, 8, 22, 211502) Correspondents have been writing, and friends have been seeing me, to ask me how to begin the village industries work and what to do first.
('66', 113, 8, 23, 211642) The obvious answer is, “Begin with yourself and do first that which is easiest for you to do.” This answer, however, does not satisfy the enquirers.
('66', 113, 8, 24, 211791) Let me, therefore, be more explicit.
('66', 113, 8, 25, 211828) Each person can examine all the articles of food, clothing and other things that he uses from day to day and replace foreign makes or city makes by those produced by the villagers in their homes or

('66', 114, 1, 2, 212179) fields with the simple inexpensive tools they can easily handle and mend.
('66', 114, 1, 3, 212253) This replacement will be itself an education of great value and a solid beginning.
('66', 114, 1, 4, 212336) The next step will be opened out to him of itself.
('66', 114, 1, 5, 212387) For instance, say, the beginner has been hitherto using a tooth brush made in a Bombay factory.
('66', 114, 1, 6, 212483) He wants to replace it with a village brush.
('66', 114, 1, 7, 212528) He is advised to use a babul twig.
('66', 114, 1, 8, 212563) If he has weak teeth or is toothless, he has to crush one end of it, with a rounded stone or a hammer, on a hard surface.
('66', 114, 1, 9, 212685) The other end he slits with a knife and uses the halves as tongue scrapers.
('66', 114, 1, 10, 212761) He will find these brushes to be cheaper and much cleaner than the very unhygienic factory made tooth brush.
('66', 114, 1, 11, 212870) The city made tooth powder he naturally replaces with equal parts of clean, finely ground wood charcoal and clean salt.
('66', 114, 1, 12, 212990) He will replace mill cloth with village spun khadi, and mill husked rice with hand husked, unpolished rice, and white sugar with village made gur.
('66', 114, 1, 13, 213137) These I have taken merely as samples already mentioned in these columns.
('66', 114, 1, 14, 213210) I have mentioned them again to deal with the difficulties that have been mentioned by those who have been discussing the question with me.
('66', 114, 1, 15, 213349) Some say, with reference to rice for instance, ‘Hand husked rice is much dearer than mill husked rice.’ Others say, ‘The art of hand husking is forgotten, and there are no huskers to be found.’ Yet others say, ‘We never get mill husked rice in our parts.
('66', 114, 1, 16, 213604) We can supply hand husked rice at 19 seers to the rupee.’ All these are right and all are wrong.
('66', 114, 1, 17, 213701) They are right so far as their own experience in their own district is concerned.
('66', 114, 1, 18, 213783) All are wrong because the real truth is unknown to them.
('66', 114, 1, 19, 213840) I am daily gathering startling experiences.
('66', 114, 1, 20, 213884) All this comes from beginning with oneself.
('66', 114, 1, 21, 213928) The following is the result of my observations to date.
('66', 114, 1, 22, 213984) Whole unpolished rice is unprocurable in the bazaars.
('66', 114, 1, 23, 214038) It is beautiful to look at and rich and sweet to the taste.
('66', 114, 1, 24, 214098) Mills can never compete with this unpolished rice.
('66', 114, 1, 25, 214149) It is husked in a simple manner.
('66', 114, 1, 26, 214182) Most of the paddy can be husked in a light chakki without difficulty.
('66', 114, 1, 27, 214252) There are some varieties the husk of which is not separated by grinding.
('66', 114, 1, 28, 214325) The best way of treating such paddy is to boil it first and then separate the chaff from the grain.
('66', 114, 1, 29, 214425) This rice, it is said, is most nutritious and, naturally, the cheapest.
('66', 114, 1, 30, 214497) In the villages, if they husk their own paddy, it must always be cheaper for the peasants than the corresponding mill husked rice, whether polished or unpolished.
('66', 114, 1, 31, 214660) The majority of rice found ordinarily in the bazaars is always more or lesspolished, whether hand husked or mill husked.
('66', 114, 1, 32, 214781) Wholly unpolished rice is always hand husked and is every time cheaper than the
('66', 115, 0, 1, 214861) 116 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 115, 1, 2, 214903) mill husked rice, the variety being the same.
('66', 115, 1, 3, 214949) Subject to further research, the observations so far show that it is because of our criminal negligence that rice eating millions eat deteriorated rice and pay a heavy price into the bargain.
('66', 115, 1, 4, 215141) Let the village worker test the truth of these observations for himself.
('66', 115, 1, 5, 215214) It won’t be a bad beginning.
('66', 115, 1, 6, 215243) Next week I must take up gur and other articles of diet and another part of village work.

('66', 115, 3, 8, 215352) 147. HIS ECONOMIC FAITH
('66', 115, 4, 9, 215376) Professor Sam Higginbottom, Director of the Agricultural Institute, Allahabad, and a member of the Board of Advisers of the All India Village Industries Association, writes in the course of a letter: 1
('66', 115, 5, 10, 215578) I enunciate my economic faith which is at the base of all my economic and spiritual efforts for India.
('66', 115, 6, 11, 215681) The two primary factors of production are land and labour.
('66', 115, 6, 12, 215740) These are united or married, and the offspring is all material things needful and desirable for man’s physical well being.
('66', 115, 6, 13, 215863) We call it ‘capital’.
('66', 115, 7, 14, 215885) Capital is the offspring of the union of land and labour.
('66', 115, 7, 15, 215943) India has land and labour in great abundance.
('66', 115, 7, 16, 215989) Both need wise use and guidance to be most beneficial to India.
('66', 115, 7, 17, 216053) This they have lacked very largely up to the present.
('66', 115, 7, 18, 216107) Hence I stress the training of village workers who will not waste all their time complaining of what they do not have, and, therefore, get discouraged and beaten at the start; but workers who will take the village as it is, with all its resources or lack of them, and, by making better use of the existing resources and the potential resources that are within the present financial grasp of the villager, create, with the land and their labour, the capital within the village suited to the village needs.
('66', 115, 7, 19, 216612) This is a long, slow, educative process that means hard work, but certain success.
('66', 115, 8, 20, 216695) The details of the programme will include proper use of all village wastes for soil enrichment; the prevention of erosion; the right system of rotation of crops; the selection of better seed, methods and implements; cattle improvement through selective breeding and proper feeding; co operation for purchasing and marketing of village products, for road improvement;

('66', 116, 1, 3, 217315) There is a great deal in this with which every lover of the movement for the restoration of village life to its proper status must heartily agree.

('66', 116, 4, 6, 217492) ANOTHER HARIJAN SEVAK GONE
('66', 116, 5, 7, 217519) Acharya Gidwani was a staunch Harijan sevak.
('66', 116, 5, 8, 217564) He was deeply interested in Harijan work.
('66', 116, 5, 9, 217606) He was bringing up a Harijan girl as a member of his own family.
('66', 116, 5, 10, 217671) With him there was none low none high.
('66', 116, 5, 11, 217710) Love of Harijan service was an integral part of his nature.
('66', 116, 5, 12, 217770) I had known him fight for Harijans when he first came to me.
('66', 116, 5, 13, 217831) He never hesitated whenever the call to service came.
('66', 116, 5, 14, 217885) Such servants of humanity never die.
('66', 116, 5, 15, 217922) They live through their service.
('66', 116, 5, 16, 217955) The deceased leaves a brave widow and a large family.
('66', 116, 5, 17, 218009) I tender them my respectful sympathy.
('66', 116, 6, 18, 218047) CREDIT v.
('66', 116, 6, 19, 218057) CASH The question repeatedly arises in the management of the numerous khadi bhandars of the All India Spinners’ Association whether khadi should be sold on credit.
('66', 116, 6, 20, 218221) For years past I have held the opinion that it is a wrong principle to have credit sales in businesses conducted on purely philanthropic lines.
('66', 116, 6, 21, 218365) Such philanthropic manage ment should be able to teach the public that credit sales mean an advance upon the prices that would be asked for cash sales.
('66', 116, 6, 22, 218517) Only such sales can become an index of public patronage of a business run on philanthropic lines.
('66', 116, 6, 23, 218615) I have found in the end that, whilst there may be some heart burning in the beginning, there is a decided advantage.
('66', 116, 6, 24, 218732) Philanthropy has to be detached from immediate results.
('66', 116, 6, 25, 218788) It has got to work on simple, unchallengeable faith.
('66', 116, 6, 26, 218841) I would, therefore, strongly advise all managers of stalls under the All India Spinners’ Association and allied organizations, and the All India Village Industries Association, which will be presently at work, to adhere to the principle of cash sales, and elimination of credit altogether.

('66', 117, 4, 7, 219353) You regard it as a firm friend.
('66', 117, 4, 8, 219385) I do not therefore send you any condolences.
('66', 117, 4, 9, 219430) But if you are in need of a companion at this moment, then you know that you are to count me as one among many who would be silently sharing with you whatever it may be called—grief, separation, loss, etc.
('66', 117, 4, 10, 219636) I do not come to pay a ceremonial visit.

('66', 118, 1, 4, 220377) Khan Saheb is here today.
('66', 118, 1, 5, 220403) I read out your telegram to him.
('66', 118, 1, 6, 220436) You must have received the long telegram of blessings which he sent after reading it.
('66', 118, 1, 7, 220522) You appear to be specializing in arranging marriages.
('66', 118, 1, 8, 220576) This marriage will be remembered as a historical event.
('66', 118, 1, 9, 220632) Poor Sophia could never have thought that she would marry a Pathan.
('66', 118, 1, 10, 220700) Nor could Saadulla have imagined that he would marry a Khoja girl.
('66', 118, 1, 11, 220767) I like your selection very much.
('66', 118, 1, 12, 220800) Both will be happy and Sophia will be able to do public work as much as she wishes.
('66', 118, 1, 13, 220884) All of us will reach Wardha on Tuesday.
('66', 118, 1, 14, 220924) There will be no new face in our party.
('66', 118, 1, 15, 220964) A nice girl engaged to Chand Tyagi’s Balbir is with us.
('66', 118, 1, 16, 221020) Both Marys will get down at Betul.
('66', 118, 1, 17, 221055) It seems that Sardar, Rajaji and Rajenbabu will have to stay on till February 8. The discussion on the Bill will be over by then.

('66', 118, 3, 28, 221818) It would be worth while to have the Trust deed executed.

('66', 119, 8, 19, 222969) Acharya Gidwani’s death has left a void among good workers in the Harijan cause.
('66', 119, 8, 20, 223050) It is not one which can be easily filled.
('66', 119, 8, 21, 223092) Acharya Gidwani made no distinction whatever between high and low.
('66', 119, 8, 22, 223159) He never believed in exclusiveness as between Harijans and non Harijans.
('66', 119, 8, 23, 223232) He was a born worker.
('66', 119, 8, 24, 223254) For the last few years, he had a Harijan girl in his house brought up as his own daughter.
('66', 119, 8, 25, 223345) This is not the occasion to describe his other services.
('66', 119, 8, 26, 223402) His capacity for renunciation was very great.
('66', 119, 8, 27, 223448) He was the first Principal of the Gujarat Vidyapith.
('66', 119, 8, 28, 223501) He had the knack of stealing the hearts of his students.
('66', 119, 8, 29, 223558) In order to perpetuate his sacred memory, the Gidwani Memorial Fund is being instituted under the chairmanship of Shri Parikshitlal Majmudar.

('66', 121, 3, 5, 225689) Read the accompanying letter and give it to Keshu.
('66', 121, 3, 6, 225740) This match seems good to me if you all approve it.
('66', 121, 3, 7, 225791) Whatever the final decision, inform me at Wardha immediately.
('66', 121, 3, 8, 225853) Let me know what changes you noticed in this year’s budget for the dairy.
('66', 121, 3, 9, 225927) Valji has sent in his resignation as Secretary because he doesn’t have the necessary knowledge for looking after the dairy and the tannery and is not inclined to take the trouble to acquire it.
('66', 121, 3, 10, 226121) Kanu is happy here.
('66', 121, 3, 11, 226141) Panditji is here just now and Kanu is even learning a little music with his help and English with Marybehn’s help.
('66', 121, 3, 12, 226256) Since his needs are few and simple, he gets along all right.
('66', 121, 4, 13, 226317) Blessings from BAPU

('66', 121, 7, 17, 226465) January 27, 1935
('66', 121, 8, 18, 226482) Facing the mild afternoon sun, Mahatma Gandhi referred to the twin legislations sought to be promoted in the last Assembly, and said: As regards the Temple entry Bill, this need not be pursued at the present moment, because obviously public opinion must be sufficiently cultivated in its favour.
('66', 121, 8, 19, 226778) The Harijan workers are doing this, the mass mind of the Hindu is passively in favour of it.
('66', 121, 8, 20, 226871) Yet the intelligentsia among sanatanists, especially the pundits are still against it.
('66', 121, 9, 21, 226958) In a matter of this kind, they could not force the pace by a majority of votes alone.
('66', 121, 9, 22, 227044) Those interested in the subject might meanwhile make a special study of the subject.
('66', 121, 9, 23, 227129) As for the Removal of Untouchability Bill, Mahatma Gandhi advised, this could be pursued to the end.
('66', 121, 9, 24, 227230) It concerned the civic rights of the Harijans and so could
('66', 121, 10, 25, 227289) 1 Held in the Harijan Colony, Kingsway Camp.
('66', 121, 10, 26, 227334) Thirty five M. L. A.s attended the meeting at the invitation of G. D. Birla.
('66', 122, 0, 1, 227411) VOL.66:16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 123
('66', 122, 1, 2, 227455) be taken by all legislators, whether Hindus, Mussalmans or others.
('66', 122, 1, 3, 227522) Even if the whole body of Hindu opinion were to be against the removal of untouchability, still he would advise a secular legislature like the Assembly not to tolerate that attitude, for in this matter there was no interference with religious rights or religious observance, but simply the removal of untouchability from the statute law of this country.
('66', 122, 1, 4, 227876) Take for instance the use of public wells which was the sorest point with the Harijans.
('66', 122, 1, 5, 227964) Cattle could approach these wells and tanks, but not the Harijans.
('66', 122, 1, 6, 228031) It bordered on inhumanity when it was known that in Rajputana thousands of rupees had to be spent for boring wells, and yet there the Harijans were not allowed to use them.
('66', 122, 1, 7, 228204) Similarly about schools.
('66', 122, 1, 8, 228229) He could quote chapter and verse on this matter.
('66', 122, 1, 9, 228278) There was the Bill promoted by Mr. M. R Jayakar 1 and another Bill recently drafted by Mr. C. Rajagopalachari.
('66', 122, 1, 10, 228389) Such a Bill could be further elucidated and amended, if necessary, but it should be pursued as quickly as possible.
('66', 122, 1, 11, 228505) It was the bounden duty of the Hindus after the resolution passed 2 by the Conference in Bombay under the chairmanship of Malaviyaji, to support a Bill of this kind and for the Hindu members of the Assembly to actively pursue it.
('66', 122, 2, 12, 228735) The services of Harijan Sevak Sangh would be available to the members in this matter.
('66', 122, 3, 13, 228821) There were other directions in which the Assembly could help in the Harijan welfare.
('66', 122, 3, 14, 228906) No doubt provincial Governments were wide awake and trying to do several things for the Harijans.
('66', 122, 3, 15, 229004) The activities of the Harijan Sabha perhaps stimulated their efforts.
('66', 122, 3, 16, 229074) All that was for the good of the Harijans.
('66', 122, 3, 17, 229117) The Harijans should take aid from whatever quarter it came, provided it in no way compromised their essential interests.
('66', 122, 3, 18, 229238) But the Government could give only according to regulations and no more.
('66', 122, 3, 19, 229311) The Harijan Sevak Sangh however was not bound by such restrictions.
('66', 122, 3, 20, 229379) The Assembly was a fit enough body for exercising legitimate pressure upon the Government to see that funds were allotted for the purpose of the Harijan uplift.
('66', 122, 3, 21, 229540) This could be done perhaps by moving a resolution.
('66', 122, 3, 22, 229591) They could also consult Mr. M. C. Rajah and give him any help he might require.
('66', 122, 3, 23, 229671) Lastly, Mahatma Gandhi referred to the cruel treatment of the Harijans in certain parts of India recently.
('66', 122, 3, 24, 229778) He instanced a case of recent assault by zamindars in Meerut on the Harijans over the begar (forced labour) question in which one Harijan was reported to have died.
('66', 122, 3, 25, 229943) There was yet another report of tragedy from Cawnpore the full facts of which are not known yet.
('66', 122, 3, 26, 230040) Then there was the ancient quarrel in Chettinad between the Nattars and the Harijans, the latter of whom were not allowed to wear the cloth they liked.
('66', 122, 3, 27, 230192) Some of the Nattars were very unreasonable and tried to defend their attitude on the ground of custom.
('66', 122, 3, 28, 230295) On these and other instances of cruel treatment, the Assembly members might put questions and try to do something.

('66', 123, 1, 2, 230779) 159. ADVICE TO STUDENTS 1
('66', 123, 2, 3, 230805) DELHI, [Before January 28, 1935]
('66', 123, 3, 4, 230838) We propose doing medical work there.
('66', 123, 3, 5, 230875) How shall we go about our business, Mahatmaji?
('66', 123, 3, 6, 230922) Could you give us some hints?
('66', 123, 4, 7, 230952) GANDHIJI: I have experience of this work since my early days in South Africa.
('66', 123, 4, 8, 231030) Let me then begin with a warning.
('66', 123, 4, 9, 231064) By taking a littlemedical aid to them, you do not really help them.
('66', 123, 4, 10, 231132) You must teach them sanitation and hygiene, which alone can prevent malaria.
('66', 123, 4, 11, 231209) Quinine does seem to subdue malaria, but will not root it out.
('66', 123, 4, 12, 231272) What is essential is the preventive treatment and the after care of patients.
('66', 123, 4, 13, 231350) They do not know that careless diet often prepares the breeding ground for malaria germs.
('66', 123, 4, 14, 231440) They eat anything and everything.
('66', 123, 4, 15, 231474) But a malaria patient must eschew starch, too much protein, and live mainly on milk during convalescence.
('66', 123, 4, 16, 231580) That is what you have to tell them.
('66', 123, 4, 17, 231616) Teach them how to prevent disease.
('66', 123, 4, 18, 231651) I will not congratulate you if you tell me that you have distributed a thousand quinine pills.
('66', 123, 4, 19, 231746) Give them practical lessons in sanitation if you can.
('66', 123, 4, 20, 231800) Go there with spades and shovels, fill up stagnant pools, see to the drainage, see that their wells are properly dredged and that their tank is not contaminated.
('66', 123, 4, 21, 231962) The late Principal Rudra, under whose hospitable roof I have had the privilege of living, used to tell me how Delhi had fought a successful battle against the swamps and mosquito breeding pools around Delhi.
('66', 123, 4, 22, 232170) We have now to teach the people to do what the municipality or the local boards may not do, for want of funds or any other reason.
('66', 123, 4, 23, 232301) Above all, teach them to rid their village of filth and dirt.
('66', 123, 4, 24, 232363) It is the most difficult part of your work, unless you would be willing scavengers.
('66', 123, 4, 25, 232447) For days you must sweep the streets and teach them to preserve health and conserve their golden manure at one and the same time.
('66', 123, 4, 26, 232576) Poore’s Rural Hygiene used to be a precious little book on this subject.
('66', 123, 4, 27, 232649) You have to teach them to bury their night soil in nine inch deep pits and cover it up with earth, the principle being that such earth is full of life and that the sun’s rays penetrate that depth.

('66', 123, 5, 30, 232924) Winsor of St. Stephen’s College along with a dozen students had called on Gandhiji one evening.
('66', 124, 0, 1, 233020) VOL.66:16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 125
('66', 124, 1, 2, 233064) while the whole will be converted into rich manure, and you can grow the finest vegetables on this ground.
('66', 124, 1, 3, 233171) I had better tell you about internal hygiene, too.
('66', 124, 1, 4, 233222) You must study the problem of food from the point of view of health; know the foods charged with vitamins and persuade them to eat hand husked unpolished rice, whole wheatmeal, whole sugar, greens grown on their own patch of ground, and oil fresh pressed in the village oil press.
('66', 124, 1, 5, 233503) Every doctor nowadays insists on prescribing a few green leaves to be eaten raw.
('66', 124, 1, 6, 233584) Every peasant could grow all kinds of bhaji for nothing and eat it raw as part of his normal diet.
('66', 124, 1, 7, 233683) It was discovered during the War that compressed and dried vegetables were harmful and that, not lime juice, but the juice pressed out of fresh limes, was the preventive of scurvy.
('66', 124, 1, 8, 233864) We are very thankful.
('66', 124, 1, 9, 233886) Could you tell us what we should teach in a little Harijan school we are running?
('66', 124, 1, 10, 233968) All that I have told you.
('66', 124, 1, 11, 233994) Let me assure you that education in three R’s is as nothing compared to a sound grounding in the elements of hygiene and sanitation.
('66', 124, 1, 12, 234127) I happened to see a number of Harijan girls learning in a Daryaganj school.
('66', 124, 1, 13, 234203) As soon as I saw them, my eyes caught sight of their dirty nails, dirtier noses and dirt accumulating little trinkets on their noses and their ears.
('66', 124, 1, 14, 234352) This thing had apparently never struck the good woman who was in charge of them.
('66', 124, 1, 15, 234433) Teach them first the lessons of cleanliness.
('66', 124, 1, 16, 234478) Literary training by itself is not of much account.
('66', 124, 1, 17, 234530) Take care of the essentials I have told you.
('66', 124, 1, 18, 234575) Remember that unlettered persons have found no difficulty in ruling over large States.
('66', 124, 1, 19, 234662) President Kruger could hardly sign his own name.
('66', 124, 1, 20, 234711) Teach them the three R’s by all means, but don’t make a fetish of them.
('66', 124, 2, 21, 234783) One more question.
('66', 124, 2, 22, 234802) We have a little Cold Weather Fund.
('66', 124, 2, 23, 234838) How are we to find the most deserving folk for this?
('66', 124, 2, 24, 234891) Well, hand it over to me or to the Harijan Sevak Sangh.
('66', 124, 3, 25, 234947) We would administer it ourselves, Well, then, go to the slums of the city, seek out the poorest and give them.
('66', 124, 4, 26, 235058) To the slums?
('66', 124, 4, 27, 235072) Certainly.
('66', 124, 4, 28, 235083) Surely not the Viceregal quarters, for you will find the stables there warmer and cleaner and more comfortable than our hovels.
('66', 124, 4, 29, 235211) No, you need not go very far.
('66', 124, 4, 30, 235241) You will find people around you wanting the things which you can spare and they most need.

('66', 125, 1, 3, 235457) She gave him her blanket, as Dr. Ansari had given her his shawl in England.
('66', 125, 2, 4, 235533) But, Sir, sometimes these people pretend to be poor when they are not.
('66', 125, 2, 5, 235604) How are we to find out the bona fide cases?
('66', 125, 2, 6, 235648) So you must be God!
('66', 125, 2, 7, 235668) Pray don’t think you have a monopoly of honesty.
('66', 125, 2, 8, 235717) Concentrate on one village—Wazirabad; 1 make it a model village and then ask me to come and inspect your work.

('66', 125, 6, 13, 235966) “My heart’s desire is fulfilled”, he uttered in ecstasy and gave the hundred rupee note and yarn to Gandhiji.
('66', 125, 6, 14, 236076) Gandhiji asked him: What are you doing?
('66', 125, 6, 15, 236116) I remember to have seen you before.
('66', 125, 6, 16, 236152) Where have you come from?
('66', 125, 7, 17, 236178) [s.] I am coming from Madras.
('66', 125, 7, 18, 236208) I am doing nothing.
('66', 125, 7, 19, 236228) I am happy taking your name.
('66', 125, 7, 20, 236257) [G.] But if you are doing nothing, where did you get the hundred rupees from?
('66', 125, 8, 21, 236335) Oh, Mahatmaji, I have something more.
('66', 125, 8, 22, 236373) Then, why not give that, too?
('66', 125, 9, 23, 236403) He pulled out another hundred rupee note and handed it to me.
('66', 125, 9, 24, 236465) But let me know what you are doing?
('66', 125, 10, 25, 236501) I was a shroff.
('66', 125, 10, 26, 236517) But I am one no longer.
('66', 125, 10, 27, 236541) I divided the property between my three sons and am now free, free to do your work.
('66', 125, 10, 28, 236625) Have me as your scavenger, I want nothing else.
('66', 125, 10, 29, 236673) So you divided all the property between your sons and left no share for me?
('66', 125, 11, 30, 236749) Oh, no.
('66', 125, 11, 31, 236757) Everything is yours.
('66', 125, 11, 32, 236778) I had thought of bringing a thousand rupees for you.
('66', 125, 11, 33, 236831) My son did give thousand rupees, but he did so reluctantly.
('66', 125, 11, 34, 236891) He had lost something this year and would not cheerfully part with a big amount.
('66', 125, 11, 35, 236972) I said: ‘Take back half of it, and send it to me when I ask for it.’

('66', 126, 1, 2, 237245) And with this he took out all the rest of the notes and gave them to me.
('66', 126, 1, 3, 237318) Laughing heartily Gandhiji said: But how will you go back?
('66', 126, 1, 4, 237377) Keep something for your fare.
('66', 126, 2, 5, 237407) I can send a telegram for money.
('66', 126, 2, 6, 237440) I do not need anything.
('66', 126, 2, 7, 237464) Take it all, Mahatmaji, it is all yours.
('66', 126, 2, 8, 237505) What do you propose to do now?
('66', 126, 3, 9, 237536) Nothing.
('66', 126, 3, 10, 237545) Have me as your humblest servant.
('66', 126, 3, 11, 237579) If not, let me stay here a couple of days and then I will go to my home in Rajputana.
('66', 126, 3, 12, 237665) Gandhiji gave instructions for putting him up and gently said: Mahadev, return to him all the notes.
('66', 126, 3, 13, 237766) How can we take all that?
('66', 126, 3, 14, 237792) Or have one and return the rest.
('66', 126, 4, 15, 237825) “Nonsense,” said the proud donor.
('66', 126, 4, 16, 237859) “I will not touch again what I have given.
('66', 126, 4, 17, 237902) Mahatmaji, believe me, all is yours.
('66', 126, 4, 18, 237939) I wanted to bring a thousand, but could not.” If you will give me all I want, give me a crore.
('66', 126, 5, 19, 238034) I will, but I must send the hundi to God, and if I were saint Narasinha Mehta, God might cash it.
('66', 126, 5, 20, 238132) Well, well, I wish all Marwaris were like you.
('66', 126, 5, 21, 238179) You are giving me all you have, whereas millionaires give me a paltry hundred or a thousand.
('66', 126, 6, 22, 238272) Gandhiji said, in childlike mirth, which he simply could not repress: But, why not, why not ask your sons also to give me something?
('66', 126, 6, 23, 238405) Why must they enjoy their wealth?
('66', 126, 7, 24, 238439) They will give, you may be sure.
('66', 126, 7, 25, 238472) I have still kept some silver.
('66', 126, 7, 26, 238503) It is yours.
('66', 126, 7, 27, 238516) Naught is mine.
('66', 126, 7, 28, 238532) All my desires have had their full fruition today, now that I have seen you and touched your feet.

('66', 126, 10, 33, 238789) Spend as much time with Nathji as necessary.
('66', 126, 10, 34, 238834) It will not have been wasted.
('66', 126, 10, 35, 238864) You are not going to be scared because the work in the villages is new to you, just as we are not to be discouraged whether the eleven vows 2 are new or old.

('66', 127, 4, 14, 240065) Learn about it from the local agricultural department if it can be done without difficulty.

('66', 129, 6, 11, 242988) MY DEAR DINSHAW, I have not been able to reach your letter to Mahadev earlier.
('66', 129, 6, 12, 243067) I do not know how I can make your appeal bear fruit.
('66', 129, 6, 13, 243120) The only scheme that I can suggest for the financial management of the institution apart from its trust is your almost cent per cent success.
('66', 129, 6, 14, 243262) But that does not depend purely upon skill.
('66', 129, 6, 15, 243306) There must be the hand of God in it also.
('66', 129, 6, 16, 243348) If He blesses you with success, that would be sufficient scheme.
('66', 129, 6, 17, 243413) If He does not, nothing that you can do personally will avail.
('66', 129, 6, 18, 243476) I know that this can give you little satisfaction.
('66', 129, 6, 19, 243527) But what you call my mature judgment makes me say this without any hesitation.
('66', 129, 6, 20, 243606) I was grieved to hear about Khambhatta.
('66', 129, 6, 21, 243646) 3 I hope that he is gaining ground quickly.
('66', 129, 6, 22, 243690) Your advice for a radical change is certainly sound.
('66', 129, 6, 23, 243743) He should surely adopt it.
('66', 129, 6, 24, 243770) I entirely agree with you that he should leave Bombay at any cost.
('66', 129, 6, 25, 243837) You can show this letter to him.
('66', 129, 6, 26, 243870) Please write to me at Wardha.
('66', 129, 6, 27, 243900) This is being dictated on the train that is taking us to Wardha.

('66', 130, 2, 3, 244419) WARDHA, January 29, 1935
('66', 130, 3, 4, 244444) MY DEAR HARIBHAU,
('66', 130, 4, 5, 244462) I have your postcard.
('66', 130, 4, 6, 244484) Evidently you have not been reading Harijan.
('66', 130, 4, 7, 244529) I have reproduced the testimony of Dr. Ansari and other doctors in its pages.
('66', 130, 4, 8, 244607) 1 Medical testimony in favour of unpolished rice is universal.
('66', 130, 4, 9, 244670) It is being eaten even now in Sambalpur and many parts of Bengal.
('66', 130, 4, 10, 244736) Proof of the pudding is in the eating.
('66', 130, 4, 11, 244775) You should try the thing yourself.
('66', 130, 4, 12, 244810) You are quite right in saying that unpolished rice is harder to cook.
('66', 130, 4, 13, 244880) But it is not harder to digest if it is well cooked.
('66', 130, 4, 14, 244933) It must take longer to cook for the simple reason that unpolished rice contains organic salts and protein.
('66', 130, 4, 15, 245040) Polished rice is practically starch.
('66', 130, 4, 16, 245077) Starch always takes less time to cook.
('66', 130, 4, 17, 245116) Unpolished rice is like unskinned pulses or vegetables.
('66', 130, 4, 18, 245172) If you skin your dal and your vegetables they are easily cooked, but they are also less nutritious.
('66', 130, 4, 19, 245272) A nutritious article takes a longer time to digest, as it must, but it is not on that account considered to be indigestible.
('66', 130, 4, 20, 245397) If you say that you cannot eat the same quantity of unpolished rice as that of polished, you will be quite right.
('66', 130, 4, 21, 245511) Our object, however, is not to fill the belly with as much as can be put into it, but to take a proper proportion of balanced foods.
('66', 130, 4, 22, 245644) The habit of eating polished rice is waste of national health and wealth.
('66', 130, 4, 23, 245718) You will remember you sent me medical opinion which you thought was in favour of cow’s milk in preference to buffalo’s milk.
('66', 130, 4, 24, 245843) I think I showed to you that the authority you sent was not conclusive.
('66', 130, 4, 25, 245915) The authority in question merely showed that cow’s milk was better for infants than buffalo’s milk.
('66', 130, 4, 26, 246015) I want decisive opinion in favour of cow’s milk to buffalo’s milk even for adults if that opinion can be honestly sustained.

('66', 131, 4, 5, 246319) Kodanda Rao has been in America for some time.
('66', 131, 4, 6, 246366) He is a member of the Servants of India Society founded by the late G. K. Gokhale whom I have regarded and often described as my political guru.
('66', 131, 4, 7, 246511) Kodanda Rao was private secretary to the Right Hon.
('66', 131, 4, 8, 246563) Srinivasa Sastri when he was appointed the Agent General of Govern ment of India in South Africa.
('66', 131, 4, 9, 246661) He was editor of the Servant of India when he left for America.
('66', 131, 4, 10, 246725) He is a moderate in politics and an ardent social reformer holding advanced views on many social problems.
('66', 131, 4, 11, 246832) He rendered me great assistance whilst I was permitted to carry on the anti untouchability movement from the Yeravda Prison.
('66', 131, 4, 12, 246957) I have no doubt that he will receive a patient and courteous hearing wherever he goes.
('66', 131, 4, 13, 247044) Any assistance rendered to him will be deeply appreciated by me.

('66', 131, 10, 19, 247226) I had your three letters, two of which do not call for any answer.
('66', 131, 10, 20, 247293) Have you sent Kumarappa your form duly filled in?
('66', 131, 10, 21, 247343) If the experiment that is being made in the use of groundnut oil for lighting purposes is successful, it will have far reaching consequences.
('66', 131, 10, 22, 247485) I hope that whoever is carrying on the experiment will persevere in spite of failures.
('66', 131, 10, 23, 247572) I am sorry that you could not collect much funds.
('66', 131, 10, 24, 247622) But the absence of response ought not to cause any worry to you.
('66', 131, 10, 25, 247687) You should simply cut your coat according to the cloth.

('66', 132, 2, 3, 247921) January 29, 1935
('66', 132, 3, 4, 247938) DEAR KHAN SAHEB,
('66', 132, 4, 5, 247955) By the courtesy of the authorities I was able to get your prompt reply.
('66', 132, 4, 6, 248027) I have now come to Wardha.
('66', 132, 4, 7, 248054) Here I shall be for some time at least.
('66', 132, 4, 8, 248094) I was obliged to leave Mehrtaj with Dr. Khan Saheb in Delhi where he has taken a house for the Assembly session.
('66', 132, 4, 9, 248207) Mrs. Khan Saheb has arrived.
('66', 132, 4, 10, 248236) Both she and her daughter are quite well.
('66', 132, 4, 11, 248278) Your letter was translated to Mehrtaj, but she will not come to Wardha.
('66', 132, 4, 12, 248350) Her difficulty is this: She is so gentle and wants to be so appropriate that she would not take advantage of the facilities that are offered to her.
('66', 132, 4, 13, 248499) She wants to live in Wardha as the others are living.
('66', 132, 4, 14, 248553) She is physically and mentally unable to do so; and she won’t live as she would like to although she knows that she has the fullest liberty to do so.
('66', 132, 4, 15, 248703) In Mariam she has a companion of her age and habits.
('66', 132, 4, 16, 248756) So she would not leave her.
('66', 132, 4, 17, 248784) And she had become fast friends with Zohra 1 who has showered all her affection on Mehrtaj.
('66', 132, 4, 18, 248876) She had under Dr. Ansari’s roof all the little things to which she was accustomed and she had no hesitation in taking them, because the whole family also did as she was doing.
('66', 132, 4, 19, 249052) It was, therefore, impossible for Mehrtaj to tear herself away from the surroundings she liked and return to those which she did not like 2. We all therefore felt that for the time being it was best to leave Mehrtaj with Dr. Khan Saheb.
('66', 132, 4, 20, 249289) Urdu tuition will be provided for her.
('66', 132, 4, 21, 249328) She has promised to write to me regularly.
('66', 132, 4, 22, 249371) I hope that you will be satisfied with what I have done and that you will not worry about her.
('66', 132, 4, 23, 249466) Afterall, God acts through children as through grown up people, and we can but try gently to lead girls like Mehrtaj who are still growing.
('66', 132, 4, 24, 249606) Nor need you be anxious about Ghani.
('66', 132, 4, 25, 249643) We are doing everything that is possible in the circumstances.
('66', 132, 4, 26, 249706) You will be pleased to know that through Jamnalalji’s effort Sadullah Khan was engaged to Sofia Somji.
('66', 132, 4, 27, 249809) 3 The engagement was announced on the 26th instant.
('66', 132, 4, 28, 249861) We have all wired our blessings.
('66', 132, 4, 29, 249894) 4 Sadullah is still in Bombay.

('66', 133, 4, 12, 250755) Another letter is necessitated by Khan Saheb’s reply, and exchange of letters may have to be continued before the matter of his children can be finally fixed up.
('66', 133, 4, 13, 250917) I now enclose herewith my reply 1 to Khan Saheb’s letter which, I hope, will be delivered to him.
('66', 133, 4, 14, 251015) In the letter received from Khan Saheb there occur the following paragraphs:
('66', 133, 5, 15, 251092) The conditions here do not agree with me.

('66', 133, 5, 17, 251217) Maybe that my health will improve as a result of the change.
('66', 133, 5, 18, 251278) There was a letter from Mrs. Dr. Khan Saheb to the Superin tendent of the jail, for an interview with me.
('66', 133, 5, 19, 251384) I wonder why those peopledid not afterwards turn up here.
('66', 133, 5, 20, 251442) If Dr. Khan Saheb should come and see me, I shall tell him all about Mehrtaj.
('66', 133, 5, 21, 251520) I wonder if Khan Saheb Abdul Ghaffar Khan will be or can be transferred to a Frontier Province or Punjab jail.
('66', 133, 5, 22, 251631) May Dr. Khan Saheb or any of his relatives see Khan Saheb Abdul Ghaffar Khan in the jail?

('66', 134, 3, 4, 251967) MY DEAR GHANI, I have your letter.
('66', 134, 3, 5, 252002) For the time being, you will draw what money you need from Rameshwar.
('66', 134, 3, 6, 252072) Here is a free translation of a letter I have received from Father.
('66', 134, 3, 7, 252140) Just now Father’s dream about his children cannot be fully realized.
('66', 134, 3, 8, 252209) As you will see from a copy of my letter 1 to Father, Mehrtaj won’t be educated as Father wants.
('66', 134, 3, 9, 252306) Dr. Khan Saheb will do the best that is possible.
('66', 134, 3, 10, 252356) Her natural inclination is to be where Dr. Khan Saheb is.
('66', 134, 3, 11, 252414) I have, therefore, left her and Lali with the Doctor in Delhi.
('66', 134, 3, 12, 252477) Lali will probably go to Dehra Dun.
('66', 134, 3, 13, 252513) You are now the one who can, if you will, carry out Khan Saheb’s wishes.
('66', 134, 3, 14, 252586) But there can be no compulsion, whether for you or for any other.
('66', 134, 3, 15, 252652) I hope you will do the best you can to come up to Khan Saheb’s expectations.
('66', 134, 3, 16, 252729) You should send me regular letters, so that when I write business letters to Father, I can incorporate portions from yours.

('66', 134, 8, 23, 253078) So far as the Congress constitution is concerned, I can do very little in the matter.
('66', 134, 8, 24, 253164) But I am of opinion that the Working Committee of the Congress will not favour any scheme of relaxing the constitution.
('66', 134, 8, 25, 253284) The requirements are surely minimum.
('66', 134, 8, 26, 253321) As for the reflection cast upon the Ahmadiya community by Ahrars 2, I have absolutely no knowledge about it.

('66', 135, 6, 11, 254079) Every consideration was shown to you.

('66', 135, 12, 20, 254564) I had your long letter.
('66', 135, 12, 21, 254588) Surely I did not want you to give so much time to my letter.
('66', 135, 12, 22, 254649) Of course, I understand you.
('66', 135, 12, 23, 254678) There was nothing by way of complaint in my letter, and you may be sure that nobody has complained to me about the Prabartak Sangh.
('66', 135, 12, 24, 254810) If I had written to you on the basis of any such complaint, I would have certainly given you the name or at least told you that I had such a complaint.
('66', 135, 12, 25, 254962) What I wrote arose solely from your own letter.

('66', 136, 6, 10, 255506) MY DEAR SASTRI,
('66', 136, 7, 11, 255522) I have not read your long report about Ganesan.
('66', 136, 7, 12, 255570) But Mahadev has given me its contents.
('66', 136, 7, 13, 255609) I propose to read the whole of it myself.
('66', 136, 7, 14, 255651) Thakkar Bapa has read it.
('66', 136, 7, 15, 255677) Here is a copy of my letter 1 to Ganesan.
('66', 136, 7, 16, 255719) I want you to act with decision and firmness.
('66', 136, 7, 17, 255765) We have to help Ganesan against himself.
('66', 136, 7, 18, 255806) I have a very weak corner for him.
('66', 136, 7, 19, 255841) But he is incorrigible about financial transactions.
('66', 136, 7, 20, 255894) He must not be supported.
('66', 136, 7, 21, 255920) I am anxiously awaiting your letter about Harijan.
('66', 136, 7, 22, 255971) I now find that by re transferring it to Poona it is possible to save Rs. 2,400 per year—not a small thing; and if the estimate is correct, it will be sinful if we incur the additional expense of Rs. 2,400 per year for the luxury of publishing it in Madras.
('66', 136, 7, 23, 256229) If you think it worth while to come down to Wardha for this purpose, you could do so.
('66', 136, 7, 24, 256315) I am writing freely and briefly to you in this matter because I rely upon your capacity to look at things philosophically and detachedly, even where you are yourself concerned.
('66', 136, 7, 25, 256492) You should finish off arrears of matter left over even though you may have to print a double number.
('66', 136, 7, 26, 256593) We cannot afford to have much arrears.
('66', 136, 7, 27, 256632) And now that the scope of Harijan is extended, demand on the space will be greater than before.

('66', 140, 9, 19, 261403) January 30, 1935
('66', 140, 10, 20, 261420) MY DEAR PATWARDHAN, You have done well in bringing the weavers’ case to my notice.
('66', 140, 10, 21, 261503) I had a similar case in Orissa during the walking tour.
('66', 140, 10, 22, 261559) It was a question affecting 10,000 weavers.
('66', 140, 10, 23, 261603) I have resolutely set my face against doing anything for weavers who weave mills spun yarn, for they cut their own throat by weaving mill spun yarn, and they know it.
('66', 140, 10, 24, 261770) But they wrongly plead helplessness.
('66', 140, 10, 25, 261807) As I told the weavers of Orissa, in a weaving family where there is one weaver, the rest of the members help in attending to the different processes through which yarn has to pass before it comes to the loom.
('66', 140, 10, 26, 262016) My suggestion then is that every weaver family should spin its own yarn, that is to say, it should do the ginning, carding and spinning.
('66', 140, 10, 27, 262153) Such a family should use for itself the khadi woven by it and put the surplus on the market.
('66', 140, 10, 28, 262246) This will ensure spinning of a high order, because all the members of the family would be interested in spinning as strong and even yarn as is possible.
('66', 141, 0, 1, 262399) 142 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 141, 1, 2, 262441) course, the income of the weaver would increase in exact proportion to the skill employed in producing good yarn.
('66', 141, 1, 3, 262555) Withefficient management, I can show that such a family stands to gain by taking up spinning.
('66', 141, 1, 4, 262649) The gain will be threefold.
('66', 141, 1, 5, 262677) It will be independent of the middleman who sells yarn and the fluctuations of the yarn market, and save a portion of the money spent in buying cloth required for the family, for, except when the price of cotton goes down very low, the value of cotton required for domestic use will always be less than the price of cloth purchased in the market.
('66', 141, 1, 6, 263024) Moreover, it has been found by experience that a man and woman use less yards of khadi than of mill cloth, and less still where khadi and yarn are respectively hand woven and hand spun.
('66', 141, 1, 7, 263210) And it is the universal testimony of practised spinners that when they have khadi woven out of their own yarn it lasts three times as long as manufactured cloth.
('66', 141, 1, 8, 263372) If this thing appeals to you, you can organize [the work].
('66', 141, 1, 9, 263431) A. I. S. A. can come to the assistance by purchasing the surplus khadi that these families will weave.
('66', 141, 1, 10, 263534) I am telling the weaver friend whose letter you have enclosed that you would explain my scheme to him.
('66', 141, 1, 11, 263637) If you like the scheme and any of the weavers will take it up under the conditions mentioned by me, you should, in order to save time, place yourself in touch with Gangadharrao, who, officially or unofficially, I do not remember which, represents the Karnatak branch of the A. I. S. A. Yours sincerely, SHRI ACHYUT PATWARDHAN COURT ROAD AHMEDNAGAR

('66', 143, 3, 4, 266104) DEAR THAKKAR BAPA, With reference to your question embodied in your letter of 21st instant, the only thing I can recommend is that the local reformers should zealously support persecuted Harijans as if they were their own blood brothers and sisters.
('66', 143, 3, 5, 266354) If even this much cannot be guaranteed to them, we may not wonder that from motives of self protection they go over to some other religion where they believe they can get some degree of protection.

('66', 143, 9, 15, 266922) I got your letters on arrival here.
('66', 143, 9, 16, 266958) Your ear seems to be giving you a good deal of trouble.
('66', 143, 9, 17, 267014) All of us here feel anxious.
('66', 143, 9, 18, 267043) Ghanshyamdas also is worried.
('66', 143, 9, 19, 267073) He has great faith in his Jew doctor in Calcutta.
('66', 143, 9, 20, 267123) His operation seems to have proved successful.
('66', 143, 9, 21, 267170) That is another reason why he is pressing that if your ear trouble is not cured soon, you should consult that doctor.
('66', 143, 9, 22, 267288) I have asked Dr. Jivraj to let me have his opinion in detail.
('66', 143, 9, 23, 267350) You also may think over this suggestion.
('66', 143, 9, 24, 267391) I do not like the repeated postponements.
('66', 143, 9, 25, 267433) Would you like Janakidevi to come overthere?
('66', 143, 9, 26, 267478) Last evening, it appeared as though she wished to do so.
('66', 143, 9, 27, 267535) She also felt that perhaps you wanted her there.
('66', 143, 9, 28, 267584) If that is so, she would certainly want to go.
('66', 143, 9, 29, 267631) I have suggested that she should wait for your reply to this letter.

('66', 148, 4, 9, 274013) 203. ESCAPING THE OBVIOUS
('66', 148, 5, 10, 274039) When I was addressing a mixed conference of Harijans and non Harijans the other day, I happened to deplore the fact that at railway stations one heard the cry ‘Mussalman milk, Mussalman water’; ‘Hindu milk, Hindu water’.
('66', 148, 5, 11, 274260) ‘Hindu chapati’ and ‘Mussalman chapati’ I could bear, though I did not believe in anything like it; but Mussalman and Hindu milk, with the making of which man had nothing to do, I could neither understand nor tolerate.
('66', 148, 5, 12, 274479) I added that those who believed in the total removal of untouchability had to be free from superstitions like ‘Mussalman and Hindu milk and water’.
('66', 148, 5, 13, 274627) I have already remarked in these columns that those who refuse to take water and the like touched by Harijans may not claim that they are free from the taint of untouchability.
('66', 148, 5, 14, 274804) It would be preposterous to justify the practice of differentiating between Mussalman and Hindu water and milk, when we do away with the difference between Harijan water and milk and non Harijan water and milk.
('66', 148, 5, 15, 275015) The great movement for the removal of untouchability would lose all its charm if it became a mere salve for conscience without truth behind it.
('66', 148, 5, 16, 275159) The virus of untouchability is all pervasive, and those who believe in it cannot be said to be free till they have ceased to regard any single individual as untouchable or in any way inferior in status by reason of his birth, community or faith.
('66', 148, 5, 17, 275405) A letter has just come to emphasize the necessity of a proper understanding of the implications of the movement.
('66', 148, 5, 18, 275518) It describes how there was a public dinner arranged over the celebration of the silver jubilee of a high school in Berar.
('66', 148, 5, 19, 275640) Harijan students were invited to it.
('66', 148, 5, 20, 275677) The letter informs me that the Harijan students were provided with separate seats, the guests drawn from all the other castes and communities sitting in one row.
('66', 148, 5, 21, 275839) Here was a wanton insult needlessly offered to the cultured Harijan students, who could not be recognized
('66', 149, 0, 1, 275945) 150 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 149, 1, 2, 275987) as such from their appearance.
('66', 149, 1, 3, 276018) Such insults at this time of the day at a high school function show that, though much headway has been made in the campaign against untouchability, the superstition persists even in the least expected quarters and in the least expected manner.
('66', 149, 1, 4, 276262) It should be borne in mind that here there was no question of inter dining, there was noquestion of mixed cooking, it was a question merely of sitting in the same row.
('66', 149, 1, 5, 276430) If sitting on the same bench in the same compartment in a railway train and eating one’s food in that condition is not inter dining, surely this was not.
('66', 149, 1, 6, 276584) But in the dictionary of untouchability, inter dining has a specific meaning which excludes sitting at meal time in the same row with people.

('66', 149, 4, 9, 276763) In answer to an inquiry, Shri J. N. Jayakaran of Y. M. C. A. Rural Reconstruction Centre, Ramnathpuram, Coimbatore, gives the following interesting information:
('66', 149, 5, 10, 276924) Krishnaswami Naidu, a small holder, knows, and demonstrates to his neighbours, that the total outturn from a coriander crop is represented not merely by the usual quantity of coriander which it can produce without the help of bees, but also by the increase in the quantity of production caused by better pollination by these busy insects plus 42 pounds of A 1 golden honey, this latter alone bringing to his pocket a decent sum of Rs. 63. He has but 10 hives of bees, which he has caught from nature and hived in cheap dealwood boxes.
('66', 149, 5, 11, 277459) Bee keeping seems to me to possess immense possibilities.
('66', 149, 5, 12, 277517) Apart from its village value, it may be cultivated as a hobby by moneyed young men and women.
('66', 149, 5, 13, 277611) They will add to the wealth of the country and produce the finest health giving sugar for themselves.
('66', 149, 5, 14, 277713) If they are philanthropically inclined, they can distribute it as health giving food among sickly Harijan children.
('66', 149, 5, 15, 277829) There is no reason why it should be a luxury of the rich or an expensive medicinal vehicle in the hands of the hakims and vaidyas.
('66', 149, 5, 16, 277960) No doubt, my hope is based on inferences drawn from meagre data.
('66', 149, 5, 17, 278025) Experiments that may be made in villages and in cities by young men and women should show whether honey can become a common article of food or has to remain an uncommon article, which it is today

('66', 150, 2, 3, 278338) Last week I dealt with rice.
('66', 150, 2, 4, 278367) Let us now take up wheat.
('66', 150, 2, 5, 278393) It is the second most important article of diet, if not the first.
('66', 150, 2, 6, 278460) From the nutritive stand point, it is the king of cereals.
('66', 150, 2, 7, 278519) By itself it is more perfect than rice.
('66', 150, 2, 8, 278559) Flour bereft of the valuable bran is like polished rice.
('66', 150, 2, 9, 278616) That branless flour is as bad as polished rice is the universal testimony of medical men.
('66', 150, 2, 10, 278706) Whole wheat flour ground in one’s own chakki 2 is any day superior to, and cheaper than, the fine flour to be had in the bazaars.
('66', 150, 2, 11, 278836) It is cheaper because the cost of grinding is saved.
('66', 150, 2, 12, 278889) Again, in whole wheat flour there is no loss of weight.
('66', 150, 2, 13, 278945) In fine flour there is loss of weight.
('66', 150, 2, 14, 278984) The richest part of wheat is contained in its bran.
('66', 150, 2, 15, 279036) There is a terrible loss of nutrition when the bran of wheat is removed.
('66', 150, 2, 16, 279109) The villagers and others who eat whole wheat flour ground in their own chakkis save their money and, what is more important, their health.
('66', 150, 2, 17, 279248) A large part of the millions that flour mills make will remain in and circulate among the deserving poor when village grinding is revived.
('66', 150, 2, 18, 279387) But the objection is taken that chakki grinding is a tedious process, that often wheat is indifferently ground and that it does not pay the villagers to grind wheat themselves.
('66', 150, 2, 19, 279564) If it paid the villagers formerly to grind their own corn, surely the advent of flour mills should make no difference.
('66', 150, 2, 20, 279683) They may not plead want of time, and when intelligence is allied to labour, there is every hope of improvement in the chakki.
('66', 150, 2, 21, 279809) The argument of indifferent grinding can have no practical value.
('66', 150, 2, 22, 279875) If the chakki was such an indifferent grinder, it could not have stood the test of time immemorial.
('66', 150, 2, 23, 279975) But to obviate the risk of using indifferently ground whole wheat flour, I suggest that, wherever there is suspicion, the flour of uneven grinding may be passed through a sieve and the contents may be turned into thick porridge and eaten with or after chapati.
('66', 150, 2, 24, 280236) If this plan is followed, grinding becomes incredibly simple, and much time and labour can be saved.
('66', 150, 3, 25, 280337) All this change can only be brought about by some previous

('66', 151, 0, 1, 280452) 152 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 151, 1, 2, 280494) preparation on the part of workers and instruction of villagers.
('66', 151, 1, 3, 280559) This isa thankless task.
('66', 151, 1, 4, 280584) But it is worth doing, if the villagers are to live in health and elementary comfort.
('66', 151, 1, 5, 280670) Gur 1 is the next article that demands attention.
('66', 151, 1, 6, 280720) According to the medical testimony I have reproduced in these columns 2, gur is any day superior to refined sugar in food value, and if the villagers cease to make gur as they are already beginning to do, they will be deprived of an important food adjunct for their children.
('66', 151, 1, 7, 280996) They may do without gur themselves, but their children cannot without undermining their stamina.
('66', 151, 1, 8, 281093) Gur is superior to bazaar sweets and to refined sugar.
('66', 151, 1, 9, 281148) Retention of gur and its use by the people in general means several crores of rupees retained by the villagers.
('66', 151, 1, 10, 281260) But some workers maintain that gur does not pay the cost of production.
('66', 151, 1, 11, 281332) The growers who need money against their crops cannot afford to wait till they have turned cane juice into gur and disposed of it.
('66', 151, 1, 12, 281463) Though I have testimony to the contrary, too, this argument is not without force.
('66', 151, 1, 13, 281545) I have no ready made answer for it.
('66', 151, 1, 14, 281581) There must be something radically wrong when an article of use, made in the place where also its raw material is grown, does not pay the cost of labour.
('66', 151, 1, 15, 281734) This is a subject that demands local investigation in each case.
('66', 151, 1, 16, 281799) Workers must not take the answer of villagers and despair of a remedy.
('66', 151, 1, 17, 281870) National growth, identification of cities with villages, depend upon the solution of such knotty problems as are presented by gur.
('66', 151, 1, 18, 282001) We must make up our mind that gur must not disappear from the villages, even if it means an additional price to be paid for it by city people.

('66', 152, 6, 17, 283491) February 1, 1935
('66', 152, 7, 18, 283508) DEAR FRIEND,
('66', 152, 8, 19, 283521) I have your letter.
('66', 152, 8, 20, 283541) I do not know what I have done with the verse sent by Sastri.
('66', 152, 8, 21, 283603) Most probably they are still lying in the Harijan file.
('66', 152, 8, 22, 283659) There is a great deal of matter still lying awaiting attention.
('66', 152, 8, 23, 283723) If you have a copy, you may send it to me.
('66', 152, 8, 24, 283766) It may be that I might have examined the verse, and not finding it suitable for the columns of Harijan, might have destroyed it.
('66', 152, 8, 25, 283895) For the answer to your question I would refer you to my Introduction to Anasaktiyoga 3 published in Gujarati.
('66', 152, 8, 26, 284005) I translated the Preface into English for the benefit of the readers of Young India.
('66', 152, 8, 27, 284090) If you get hold of the old file of Young India, you will find the translation in it.
('66', 152, 8, 28, 284175) The answer briefly is this:
('66', 152, 9, 29, 284203) 1 The addressee had stayed with Gandhiji during his visit to Delhi in January.
('66', 152, 9, 30, 284282) 2 The subscription is in Hindi.

('66', 153, 0, 1, 284373) 154 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 153, 1, 2, 284415) The Gita was written not to establish ahimsa, but to show a groping world a way of acting truly in every conceivable circumstance.
('66', 153, 1, 3, 284546) But nevertheless you can gather that the Gita leads you infallibly to ahimsa.
('66', 153, 1, 4, 284624) Remember that Arjuna was not striving to follow ahimsa, but he was struggling to get out of the duty in front of him because of his partiality which he had suddenly developed for his kinsmen.
('66', 153, 1, 5, 284816) The question before him was not whether to kill or not to kill, but whether to kill one’s kinsmen or not to kill them.
('66', 153, 1, 6, 284935) Then, again, nigraha 1 in the verse quoted by you means a fruitless fight against one’s fundamental nature.
('66', 153, 1, 7, 285043) Fight against one’s weakness is repeatedly enjoined in the Gita, but where a weakness becomes settled nature with a person all fighting becomes vain.
('66', 153, 1, 8, 285193) Arjuna’s nature was that of a fighter, not because he was born to fight but because his own individual nature loved fighting.
('66', 153, 1, 9, 285319) When, what may appear to us, weakness in a man becomes part of his being, it ceases to have the quality of weakness with him; and if at the behest of someone such a person begins to fight against his nature, he is bound to fail or else he would become a hypocrite.
('66', 153, 1, 10, 285584) To ask such a person to go against his nature would be to expect a leopard to change his spots.

('66', 155, 4, 5, 287773) I like your very thorough report on the allegations of the Meghs of the Arya Nagar Colony.
('66', 155, 4, 6, 287864) Can you now follow it up by seeing the members of the Sabha 1, finding out how the negotiations go and do whatever is possible on behalf of the poor Meghs?
('66', 155, 4, 7, 288020) I suppose the corresponding Salvation Army Colony is flourishing, well managed and that the Christian settlers or tenants, whatever they be, are quite happy.

('66', 155, 10, 14, 288375) There was a long complaint from the Meghs of the Arya Nagar Colony of the Punjab.

('66', 156, 3, 5, 289023) MURARILAL,
('66', 156, 4, 6, 289034) Your letter is most businesslike and valuable.
('66', 156, 4, 7, 289081) It will be very helpful.
('66', 156, 4, 8, 289106) I am passing it on to Sjt.
('66', 156, 4, 9, 289133) Kumarappa who will write to you fully about it.

('66', 156, 9, 20, 289739) MY DEAR SUBRAMANIAM,
('66', 156, 10, 21, 289760) If the teachers are truly repentant, I suppose they must be allowed to remain.
('66', 156, 10, 22, 289839) It is difficult for me to give you infallible guidance without knowing the parties and knowing the method under which the institution is being run.
('66', 156, 10, 23, 289987) There can never be too much purity in teachers.
('66', 156, 10, 24, 290035) And the problem of getting the right type of teachers and managers for institutions where boys or girls receive training is proving more and more baffling.

('66', 159, 9, 20, 293501) BHAI JAINENDRA,
('66', 159, 10, 21, 293517) This may be the brief answer to your letter.
('66', 159, 10, 22, 293562) You yourself have given it.
('66', 159, 10, 23, 293590) For a belief in rebirth, it is necessary to believe in the existence of ‘I’.
('66', 159, 10, 24, 293667) If I do not exist and God alone exists, then who is to be reborn and how?
('66', 159, 10, 25, 293741) This realization itself is rebirth, isn’t it?
('66', 159, 10, 26, 293787) The possibility of rebirth is there only as long as the ‘I’ exists.
('66', 159, 10, 27, 293855) When you truly believe—merely saying it is not enough—that ‘God alone exists’, then there is no rebirth for you.
('66', 159, 10, 28, 293968) The man who becomes one with God is liberated.
('66', 159, 10, 29, 294015) This much your reason will certainly accept.
('66', 159, 10, 30, 294060) But it will not be realized in experience.
('66', 159, 10, 31, 294103) Realization may take even thousands of years.
('66', 159, 10, 32, 294149) Realization comes through the heart.
('66', 159, 10, 33, 294186) The head can provide only logic.
('66', 159, 10, 34, 294219) But what is the worth of logic?
('66', 159, 10, 35, 294251) Service alone can bring about realization.

('66', 160, 3, 4, 294463) DEAR AMRIT,
('66', 160, 4, 5, 294475) Here is my message for the Harijans who are troubled about child marriages.
('66', 160, 4, 6, 294551) “In these days of self purification, Harijans ought to know that they are to avoid all the bad customs of caste Hindus.
('66', 160, 4, 7, 294671) They should therefore avoid child marriages.
('66', 160, 4, 8, 294716) But reformers may not be impatient.
('66', 160, 4, 9, 294752) Sarda Act is, in my opinion, a wise step.
('66', 160, 4, 10, 294794) But it may not be strictly enforced against Harijans when it is very laxly enforced against caste Hindus.
('66', 160, 4, 11, 294900) There should be effective enlightened propaganda by Harijans among fellow Harijans on the evil of child marriages and the bearing of the Sarda Act on them.
('66', 160, 4, 12, 295056) And then when it is made certain that people wilfully ignore that Act, a few prosecutions may be undertaken.
('66', 160, 4, 13, 295165) But even then they must be the sole concern of Harijans.
('66', 160, 4, 14, 295222) They may not ask for or receive even financial assistance in this matter from caste Hindus.
('66', 160, 4, 15, 295314) In any case at least one year should be given to concentrated propaganda.” If this is not the message you want you may withhold publication and let me know what you want.
('66', 160, 5, 16, 295485) There is no cold here.
('66', 160, 5, 17, 295508) We have been having rains instead.

('66', 161, 4, 7, 295855) Rani Vidyavati is the wife of a poor broken down zamindar in Hardoi district.
('66', 161, 4, 8, 295933) I have known her for years as a staunch Congress worker.
('66', 161, 4, 9, 295990) She has been to jail.
('66', 161, 4, 10, 296012) She is now ailing from some disease which the local doctors opine requires special treatment, probably even an operation.
('66', 161, 4, 11, 296134) They have advised her to seek the shelter of Chittaranjan Seva Sadan.
('66', 161, 4, 12, 296204) Naturally the request came to me some months ago that I should write to you and inquire whether you could accommodate her at the Seva Sadan as a poor patient.
('66', 161, 4, 13, 296363) But later, there seemed to be an improvement in her health, and therefore she postponed her going to Calcutta.
('66', 161, 4, 14, 296474) Now, evidently, she has to undergo special treatment.
('66', 161, 4, 15, 296528) If you find that she can be admitted to the Seva Sadan, please write to me and telegraph to her at Barua House, Wazir Hasan Road, Lucknow.
('66', 161, 4, 16, 296667) It might be as well to telegraph to her directly even if you cannot admit her.

('66', 162, 7, 24, 298434) Be at ease.
('66', 162, 7, 25, 298446) Do not come.
('66', 162, 7, 26, 298459) Look within yourself, be calm and good.
('66', 162, 7, 27, 298499) Live independently and rise high.
('66', 162, 7, 28, 298533) That is my hope and my blessing.
('66', 162, 7, 29, 298566) My letter must have reached you.

('66', 163, 3, 4, 298887) SHIVABHAI, I have your letter.
('66', 163, 3, 5, 298918) It seems that a beginning has been made.
('66', 163, 3, 6, 298959) In my opinion there is no place for buffaloes or ghee made out of buffalo’s milk in our village industries.
('66', 163, 3, 7, 299067) What shall we gain by interfering in the activities which are going on quite systematically?
('66', 163, 3, 8, 299160) We do not want to make a business out of it.
('66', 163, 3, 9, 299205) One who understands the dharma of cow protection would not speak for the buffalo.

('66', 163, 8, 14, 299405) AMBUJAM 1, You are being well tried.
('66', 163, 8, 15, 299442) It is good for you if you will take this trial in good part.
('66', 163, 8, 16, 299503) You must not be defeated.
('66', 163, 8, 17, 299529) Shower your affection on Krishnasamy.
('66', 163, 8, 18, 299567) Do not brood over his melancholia, never mind if he will not study.
('66', 163, 8, 19, 299635) Give him some occupation.
('66', 163, 8, 20, 299661) Let him spin, weave or learn carpentry.
('66', 163, 8, 21, 299701) Walk with him.
('66', 163, 8, 22, 299716) Play with him.
('66', 163, 8, 23, 299731) Have joy in your countenance.
('66', 163, 8, 24, 299761) It will infect him.
('66', 163, 8, 25, 299781) Put him with Ramachandran for a time.
('66', 163, 8, 26, 299819) Let him play games.
('66', 163, 8, 27, 299839) Let him learn Hindi.
('66', 163, 8, 28, 299860) In other words his mind and body must be joyfully occupied and all would be well.
('66', 163, 8, 29, 299942) The two Malayali girls and Silavati will not leave Wardha.
('66', 163, 8, 30, 300001) I tempted them but they are so happy here just now that they will not move.
('66', 163, 8, 31, 300077) It is no use my pressing them.
('66', 163, 8, 32, 300108) Vasumati will be ready in the middle of this month if you are.
('66', 163, 8, 33, 300171) You do not want a formal public opening ceremony, do you?
('66', 163, 8, 34, 300229) It should be a silent prayerful opening.
('66', 163, 8, 35, 300270) Let it grow naturally and without any flourish of trumpets.
('66', 163, 8, 36, 300330) Ba is disinclined to move out just now.
('66', 163, 8, 37, 300370) I do not want to press her.
('66', 163, 8, 38, 300398) And since the opening must be strictly private, Ba’s presence is wholly unnecessary.

('66', 164, 5, 9, 300807) PREMA, I am very late this time in replying to your letter.
('66', 164, 5, 10, 300867) I get no time at all.
('66', 164, 5, 11, 300889) I have been writing so much today that the right hand feels tired and I am now writing with the left hand.
('66', 164, 5, 12, 300996) The body must have lost some strength but I have no such feeling.
('66', 164, 5, 13, 301062) The fast 2 has not in the least led to an increase of weakness.
('66', 164, 5, 14, 301126) Fasting never does if one knows how to return to normal diet after wards.
('66', 164, 5, 15, 301200) I believe that the effect of my diet on my health has been nothing but beneficial.
('66', 164, 5, 16, 301283) But I cannot give reasons for this belief.
('66', 164, 5, 17, 301326) I am very glad that Father, Mother and others came and saw you.
('66', 164, 5, 18, 301390) There is certainly a remedy for the frequent pimples which you get.
('66', 164, 5, 19, 301458) For a few days live only on fruit and uncooked bhaji.
('66', 164, 5, 20, 301512) Take steam treatment and the pimples will then immediately shrink.
('66', 164, 5, 21, 301579) Havingdone this, bathe in cold water.
('66', 164, 5, 22, 301617) The skin will probably clear up in three or four days.
('66', 164, 5, 23, 301672) Then start taking milk or curd which is not sour along with fruit and uncooked bhaji.
('66', 164, 5, 24, 301758) Among the different bhajis, fenugreek leaves, spinach, luni and lettuce are the best.
('66', 164, 5, 25, 301844) I eat even the leaves and twigs of mustard.
('66', 164, 5, 26, 301888) To pray to God for anything means to aspire for it intensely.
('66', 164, 5, 27, 301950) God is both different and not different from us.
('66', 164, 5, 28, 301999) He is different because He is perfect, and He is not different because we are portion of Him.
('66', 164, 5, 29, 302093) If a drop of water separated from the sea may not pray to the sea, to whom else may it pray?
('66', 164, 5, 30, 302186) But does the sea have to do anything to

('66', 165, 1, 2, 302413) answer the prayer?
('66', 165, 1, 3, 302432) Prayer is the anguished cry of one who cannot bear separation.
('66', 165, 1, 4, 302495) The embodied soul cannot help uttering such a cry.
('66', 165, 1, 5, 302546) The key to the nation’s progress both is and is not in our hands.
('66', 165, 1, 6, 302612) We can help in its progress if we reduce ourselves to a cipher.
('66', 165, 1, 7, 302676) It is in our hands to do that.
('66', 165, 1, 8, 302707) But the progress itself is not in our hands, because our reducing ourselves to a cipher means leaving ourselves entirely in the hands of God who alone is the digit of unity.
('66', 165, 1, 9, 302881) “O Udho, the secret of karma is beyond human under standing” is an absolute truth.
('66', 165, 1, 10, 302964) We can know that there is a law of karma, but we do not know how it works.
('66', 165, 1, 11, 303039) That is God’s mercy.
('66', 165, 1, 12, 303060) We do not know the laws of even an earthly king.
('66', 165, 1, 13, 303109) How then can we know the laws of God who is Law personified?
('66', 165, 1, 14, 303170) The appearance of victory in the early part of this struggle was an illusion, and the appearance of defeat also is nothing but an illusion.
('66', 165, 1, 15, 303310) In the lexicon of one who has unshakable faith in the ultimate victory of truth, there is no such word as “defeat”.

('66', 166, 10, 19, 304606) I have your letter.
('66', 166, 10, 20, 304626) Your account of the two interviews 1 is good.
('66', 166, 10, 21, 304672) I see it all now very clearly.
('66', 166, 10, 22, 304703) Nothing more remains to be done.
('66', 166, 10, 23, 304736) But I am toying with the idea of writing to Sir Henry Craik.
('66', 166, 10, 24, 304797) If I do, of course I shall send the letter on to you.
('66', 166, 10, 25, 304851) If you don’t like it, you need not forward it.
('66', 166, 10, 26, 304898) Bhulabhai 2 cannot sign his name in the visitors’ book.
('66', 166, 10, 27, 304954) In these matters we gain nothing by swerving from the golden mean.
('66', 166, 10, 28, 305021) Bhulabhai’s courteous rejoinder should be regarded sufficient.

('66', 167, 1, 2, 305325) The courtesy and goodwill of the Home Member are personal.
('66', 167, 1, 3, 305384) The policy in the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee is that of the bureaucracy.
('66', 167, 1, 4, 305474) The policy of the bureaucracy shows no courtesy.
('66', 167, 1, 5, 305523) There is in it deliberate discourtesy.
('66', 167, 1, 6, 305562) I expect nothing good to accrue from it.
('66', 167, 1, 7, 305603) When the policy of the bureaucracy changes, any sort of constitution can be made to do for a long while.
('66', 167, 1, 8, 305708) Today the question is of a new thing being imposed, and that too by force.
('66', 167, 1, 9, 305783) No one holds a good opinion of it.
('66', 167, 1, 10, 305818) You may well stick to your attitude.
('66', 167, 1, 11, 305855) I am writing at such length only to tell you that I see no ray of hope in the atmosphere.
('66', 167, 1, 12, 305945) My personal optimism of course remains constant even in the face of darkness.
('66', 167, 1, 13, 306023) It has no other basis save the truth of our position.
('66', 167, 1, 14, 306077) You may get Vallabhbhai to decide as to what attitude Bhulabhai should adopt.
('66', 167, 1, 15, 306155) Even as I am writing this, my desire to write to the Home Member is becoming less keen.

('66', 168, 9, 17, 307515) MY DEAR KANETKAR,
('66', 168, 10, 18, 307533) It is only when you remind me that I think of the printed card or letter.
('66', 168, 10, 19, 307607) I hope I have never been found so churlish as to resent printed appeals by throwing at editors contemptible messages.

('66', 168, 11, 22, 307820) If I have repeated myself in my message to your paper, it is again because what I had originally given was of the best.
('66', 168, 11, 23, 307940) I am sorry I can’t give you anything more or better.
('66', 168, 11, 24, 307993) Better I shall never succeed in giving you; more I could give if I had the leisure to recall the past things between good Abhyankar and myself and weave them into a readable story.
('66', 168, 11, 25, 308174) For that I have no leisure.
('66', 168, 11, 26, 308202) Although I have been a journalist, so called, for nearly thirty years I have not acquired the knack of writing long things at will.
('66', 168, 11, 27, 308334) I am a bad spinner.
('66', 168, 11, 28, 308354) You should thank me that I have given to this letter so much of my time, every second of which, I assure you, is precious to me.
('66', 168, 11, 29, 308483) But I have given it for the memory of an old co worker and for your sake, as in sending the book you had sent me his introduction.
('66', 168, 11, 30, 308614) I wish I could say even now that I have read your book.

('66', 169, 6, 10, 309047) BIDHAN,
('66', 169, 7, 11, 309055) I send you herewith a questionnaire 1 on milk which you will please answer at your early convenience.
('66', 169, 7, 12, 309157) I am now in a position to seek your concrete assistance for the A.I.V.I.A. The Board has been sitting for the last four days continuously and has given instructions to its members to prosecute the programme of inducing the villagers to take to hand husking of unpolished rice and pressing their own oil and cane, and grinding their own corn wherever these four primary employments have been given up, and to attend to village sanitation and hygiene.
('66', 169, 7, 13, 309607) Now, in all this work you can give the greatest assistance by securing the co operation of medical men, medical students and other students.
('66', 169, 7, 14, 309748) You can cover the whole of Bengal with an army of workers, paid or honorary; and if the workers are good, they will repay tenfold whatever they might get, in a visible and immediate improvement in the economic condition and health of the villagers.
('66', 169, 7, 15, 309997) You can even produce a village literature that may become the model for the whole of India.
('66', 169, 7, 16, 310089) I say this deliberately, because no province has so much chemical skill as Bengal; and is it not that which is principally required in the prosecution of this programme?
('66', 169, 7, 17, 310259) I have asked Profullababu to see you in this matter.
('66', 169, 7, 18, 310312) I know you will help him.
('66', 169, 8, 19, 310338) Yours sincerely,

('66', 170, 2, 3, 310496) February 5, 1935
('66', 170, 3, 4, 310513) Ayurvedic physicians say that cow’s milk is the prince among milks from the health point of view.
('66', 170, 3, 5, 310611) They give buffalo’s milk an inferior place.
('66', 170, 3, 6, 310655) Does modern medical science sustain that view?
('66', 170, 3, 7, 310702) If so, in what way?
('66', 170, 3, 8, 310722) One hears it stated often that all fats do not act alike on the system.
('66', 170, 3, 9, 310794) Is there any distinction between butter extracted from cow’s milk and that from buffalo’s milk?
('66', 170, 3, 10, 310890) If so, what is it?
('66', 170, 3, 11, 310909) That pound per pound buffalo’s milk yields a larger quantity of fat or butter than cow’s milk is irrelevant to the inquiry.

('66', 170, 7, 16, 311126) DEAR SISTER,
('66', 170, 8, 17, 311139) I have your letter.
('66', 170, 8, 18, 311159) The best way you can help the Association is to carry on propaganda amongst the members advocating the use by them of village products and manufactures wherever they are available, and secondly to send out women workers to the villages near their place of residence to do sanitary work amongst the villagers and to induce them to take up hand husking of rice, etc.
('66', 170, 8, 19, 311524) If you are not reading or taking Harijan which gives information every week about the activities of the All India Village Industries Association, I would recommend your going in for it.
('66', 170, 8, 20, 311710) I would also ask you to put yourself in touch with Shrimati Gosibehn Captain who is a member of the A.I.V.I.A. Board.
('66', 170, 8, 21, 311828) As she happens to be here just now for the Board meetings, I am asking her to write to you.

('66', 171, 3, 6, 312161) ANSARI,
('66', 171, 4, 7, 312169) Here is another questionnaire 1 for you to answer at your early convenience.
('66', 171, 4, 8, 312246) Do please send me a list of the English books you want Sharma to read.
('66', 171, 4, 9, 312317) You need not wait for giving me any exhaustive list.
('66', 171, 4, 10, 312370) If you give me a preliminary list of the books 2 that he must read in order to qualify himself for making experiments on this very complicated human machine, that is enough.
('66', 171, 4, 11, 312544) I hope you are not wearing yourself out with work so as again to necessitate your going to Europe just for a cure.

('66', 171, 9, 17, 312784) DEAR JADHAV,
('66', 171, 10, 18, 312797) I should never have thought that over there people are killing goats in the name of religion.
('66', 171, 10, 19, 312891) Surely it is bad to have to kill them for food; but I hold it to be a blasphemy to kill any animal in the name of religion.
('66', 171, 10, 20, 313015) It is bringing down God to our level when we think that He can possibly be pleased by our sacrificing dumb animals for our sins.
('66', 171, 10, 21, 313144) The only way of pleasing God is, in my opinion, to sacrifice ourselves.

('66', 175, 4, 5, 316990) I have just finished reading the chapter on population bogey.
('66', 175, 4, 6, 317052) I must confess that it is not at all convincing.
('66', 175, 4, 7, 317101) You have given away the whole of your case by saying that pestilence and other visitations will keep the growth under check.
('66', 175, 4, 8, 317226) Their case is that modern science reduces the death rate.
('66', 175, 4, 9, 317284) Every day produces new discoveries for conservation of life.
('66', 175, 4, 10, 317345) Therefore the increase will be unbearable.
('66', 175, 4, 11, 317388) This argument seriously brought has to be seriously answered.
('66', 175, 4, 12, 317450) You have not even studied your subject.
('66', 175, 4, 13, 317490) Able writers have combated the theory of Malthus and its later developments.

('66', 175, 9, 22, 317879) I have your letter.
('66', 175, 9, 23, 317899) I am satisfied with Dr. Jivraj’s letter.
('66', 175, 9, 24, 317940) He has suggested some changes in your food.
('66', 175, 9, 25, 317984) He asks you to increase the quantity of butter in food.
('66', 175, 9, 26, 318040) Discuss the matter with him and take more butter if necessary.
('66', 175, 9, 27, 318103) I fear that you talk too much and do very little exercise.
('66', 175, 9, 28, 318162) If that is true, then you should change in both respects.
('66', 175, 9, 29, 318220) Write to me in detail.
('66', 175, 9, 30, 318243) I had a talk with Kamalnayan.
('66', 175, 9, 31, 318273) I am firmly of the view that, if he agrees, he should go to England only after getting married.
('66', 175, 9, 32, 318369) But he should not take his wife with him.
('66', 175, 9, 33, 318411) It will be almost impossible for him to study if he takes his wife with him.
('66', 175, 9, 34, 318488) It is also improper for him to lead a family life while abroad.
('66', 175, 9, 35, 318552) It would be a different matter if theywere going only on a pleasure trip.
('66', 175, 9, 36, 318626) But that is not so in this case.
('66', 175, 9, 37, 318659) My opinion is this: he should get engaged just now, go to Colombo

('66', 176, 1, 3, 318942) He may enjoy married life for some time if he wishes, but he should go to England alone.
('66', 176, 1, 4, 319031) If he wants, he may pay short visits to India.
('66', 176, 1, 5, 319078) I think the experience in Colombo will help him a lot.
('66', 176, 1, 6, 319133) He has not cultivated studious habits yet.
('66', 176, 1, 7, 319176) If he does that, there will be no difficulty whatever.

('66', 177, 7, 14, 320917) If unpolished rice is soaked in cold water for three hours as is done in the case of pulses, it will cook in very little time.

('66', 177, 7, 16, 321126) Unpolished rice should become one mass after being cooked.
('66', 177, 7, 17, 321185) As long as the grains remain separate, you must know that it is not cooked.

('66', 177, 7, 19, 321275) You will have to inhale it only as a medicine, so take small pinches of it.
('66', 177, 7, 20, 321351) The snuff for medicinal purposes should be perfectly pure.
('66', 177, 7, 21, 321410) You may be knowing that the snuff available in the market is very much adulterated.

('66', 180, 1, 4, 325110) It will have to force itself upon me.

('66', 180, 1, 6, 325227) I can’t remove this suspicion unless I hasten slowly or not hasten at all.
('66', 180, 1, 7, 325302) I have taken no further step in the way of sounding the Government as to alternatives.
('66', 180, 1, 8, 325389) I am taking my own time.

('66', 180, 6, 17, 325918) You have given me a long letter which you could have finished in four lines, but failed to answer the very relevant question that I put to you in my letter.
('66', 180, 6, 18, 326075) What is this purchase of a motor car?
('66', 180, 6, 19, 326113) Will you answer it now?
('66', 180, 6, 20, 326137) I shall be no party to making you stop publication of your newspaper against your will.
('66', 180, 6, 21, 326225) I can simply say that Kodambakkam is 1mouthful enough.
('66', 180, 6, 22, 326280) There is no room for any other.

('66', 180, 6, 25, 326496) But I am sure that you will not want others to do that which you would not have them to get done by you.

('66', 184, 5, 7, 331068) February 7, 1935
('66', 184, 6, 8, 331085) I have your two letters.
('66', 184, 6, 9, 331110) I am giving rest to the right hand.
('66', 184, 6, 10, 331146) I can write with the left, but it is a slow process.
('66', 184, 6, 11, 331199) Therefore I must, in order to catch today’s mail, dictate this to you.
('66', 184, 6, 12, 331270) I can only say ditto to all the thoughts you have expressed in both your letters.
('66', 184, 6, 13, 331352) I entirely agree that in an ideal condition there should be perfect correspondence between thought and action.
('66', 184, 6, 14, 331463) Then and then only is it possible to see truth face to face.
('66', 184, 6, 15, 331524) Amtul Salaam is in Patiala.
('66', 184, 6, 16, 331552) She is tortured by her own mind.
('66', 184, 6, 17, 331585) I wish you to overcome your objection to eggs.
('66', 184, 6, 18, 331632) I think I told you that it was possible now to have sterile eggs.
('66', 184, 6, 19, 331698) They are to be had from Sangli, Salvation Depot in Bombay, some place in Poona and Salvation Depot in Ahmedabad.
('66', 184, 6, 20, 331811) These eggs are obtained without the hens having to be mated.
('66', 184, 6, 21, 331872) As an article of daily food, from the spiritual standpoint, that would be perhaps objectionable.
('66', 184, 6, 22, 331969) But as a medical agent, sterile eggs might not be objected to.
('66', 184, 6, 23, 332032) Perhaps you know that Kamala had a set back and lost 2 lb.

('66', 185, 18, 27, 333072) Kamala has no weight to lose.
('66', 185, 18, 28, 333102) Yet I suppose there will be these ups and downs whilst she is still convalescing.

('66', 186, 3, 4, 333404) DEAR FRIEND, I have your two letters.
('66', 186, 3, 5, 333442) I hope you will excuse the delay.
('66', 186, 3, 6, 333476) My time is not my own, and I never knew that there was any hurry.
('66', 186, 3, 7, 333542) I hold totally different views from yours.
('66', 186, 3, 8, 333585) We have not to deal with the family of the great Queen as individuals, but we have to deal with them as representatives of a mighty government.
('66', 186, 3, 9, 333729) We have to celebrate an event in connection not with the private vitrues of an autocrat, but we have to deal with the events of an empire for a period of twenty five years during which King George has been the nominal head but which as an individual he has perhaps no more power to influence than you or I, and infinitely less than the Collector of your district in his own district.
('66', 186, 3, 10, 334113) I, therefore, feel that the resolution of the Working Committee 1 was the only correct thing to do.
('66', 186, 3, 11, 334213) It preserves the self respect of the nation without hurting the susceptibilities of anybody.
('66', 186, 3, 12, 334306) Lastly I have to own to you that the resolution was drafted by me as I happened to be in Delhi at the time, not by design but by accident.
('66', 186, 3, 13, 334445) They would not deal with such a delicate matter without conferring with me.
('66', 186, 3, 14, 334521) Possibly, had I not been there the resolution would have been bitter and perhaps offensive.
('66', 186, 3, 15, 334613) Everybody has owned that the present resolution is purged of any offence.

('66', 187, 16, 27, 336142) A Harijan sevak writes:
('66', 187, 17, 28, 336166) On the occasion of the Jaipur Rajya Sammelan, which was held on 25 12 34, a khadi exhibition stall was set up on the first floor of a building
('66', 187, 18, 29, 336309) 1 The note, addressed to the brother of Rajkishori, the widowed daughter in law of Chand Tyagi, was written on a letter Rajkishori wrote to her brother on February 7, 1935.
('66', 188, 0, 1, 336482) VOL.66:16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 189
('66', 188, 1, 2, 336526) overlooking the chowk, where the Sammelan was held.
('66', 188, 1, 3, 336578) A Harijan boy was first in charge of the sales, and could be seen sitting in the gallery above by the savarna Hindus who were assembled in the chowk.
('66', 188, 1, 4, 336728) The fact that a Harijan boy was allowed to sit at a higher level than themselves was very much resented by the savarna Hindus, who resolved at a Panchayat meeting that:
('66', 188, 2, 5, 336897) (1) No one from the village should attend the khadi exhibition on pain of excommunication.
('66', 188, 3, 6, 336988) (2) No one should send his girls to the local Kanya Pathshala, as it was connected with the Rajya Sammelan people.
('66', 188, 4, 7, 337103) (3) No one should permit teachers of the Harijan Pathshala to enter his home.
('66', 188, 5, 8, 337181) In spite of this ukase of the Panchayat, as many as 28 young men took part in the Sammelan.
('66', 188, 5, 9, 337273) They were fined Re.
('66', 188, 5, 10, 337293) 1 each, which they refused to pay.
('66', 188, 5, 11, 337328) From three to four hundred persons used to dine together in the Sammelan kitchen without any distinction of caste.
('66', 188, 5, 12, 337443) This fact has been seized upon by the reactionaries, who have raised the usual cry of ‘Religion in danger’.
('66', 188, 5, 13, 337551) The conduct of the orthodox section in this instance is only a proof of our abysmal ignorance.
('66', 188, 5, 14, 337646) A religion that cannot get rid of such invidious and inequitous distinctions between man and man is doomed to perish.
('66', 188, 5, 15, 337764) The fact that the savarna reformers have remained undaunted by the threat of the boycott must be regarded as a happy augury.
('66', 188, 5, 16, 337889) Let not those who may be affected by the boycott harbour any ill feeling towards the orthodox party.
('66', 188, 5, 17, 337990) At the same time, let no one be turned away from his duty by the threat of coercion.
('66', 188, 5, 18, 338075) The reformers must proceed with their work with patient, silent determination, unaffected by anger or fear.
('66', 188, 6, 19, 338183) Harijan, 8 2 1935
('66', 188, 7, 20, 338201) 274. HOW TO BEGIN?
('66', 188, 8, 21, 338220) I have dealt with some chief articles of food and shown what they mean to the villagers in health and wealth.
('66', 188, 8, 22, 338330) There is, however, the equally important subject of sanitation and hygiene.
('66', 188, 8, 23, 338406) Proper attention to these means increase in health, energy and wealth, directly and indirectly.
('66', 188, 8, 24, 338502) Some foreign observers have testified that, of all the nations of the earth, India comes, perhaps, to the top in the observance of personal cleanliness.
('66', 188, 8, 25, 338655) But I fear that it is not possible to say the same of corporate, in other words, village cleanliness.
('66', 188, 8, 26, 338757) In yet other words, we have not made much advance beyond the family interest.
('66', 188, 8, 27, 338835) We would
('66', 189, 0, 1, 338844) 190 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 189, 1, 2, 338886) sacrifice everything for the family as distinguished from the village, i e., in a sense, the nation.
('66', 189, 1, 3, 338987) Members of a family will keep their own home clean, but they will not be interested in the neighbour’s.
('66', 189, 1, 4, 339091) They will keep their courtyard clean of dirt, insects and reptiles, but will not hesitate to shove all into the neighbour’s yard.
('66', 189, 1, 5, 339221) As a result of this want of corporate responsibility, our villages are dung heaps.
('66', 189, 1, 6, 339304) Though we are an unshod nation, we so dirty our streets and roads that for a sensitive person it is painful to walk along them barefoot.
('66', 189, 1, 7, 339441) It is difficult to get clean, drinkable water in village wells, tanks and streams.
('66', 189, 1, 8, 339524) The approaches to an ordinary village are heaped with muck and rubbish.
('66', 189, 1, 9, 339596) Village sanitation is, perhaps, the most difficult task before the All India Village Industries Association.
('66', 189, 1, 10, 339705) No Government can change the habits of a people without their hearty co operation.
('66', 189, 1, 11, 339788) And if the latter is forthcoming, a Government will have little to do in the matter.
('66', 189, 1, 12, 339873) The intelligentsia—medical men and students—can deal with the problem successfully if they would conscientiously, intelligently, jealously and regularly do the work in the villages.
('66', 189, 1, 13, 340055) Attention to personal and corporate hygiene is the beginning of all education.
('66', 189, 1, 14, 340134) The things to attend to in the villages are cleaning tanks and wells and keeping them clean, getting rid of dung heaps.
('66', 189, 1, 15, 340254) If the workers will begin the work themselves, working like paid Bhangis from day to day and always letting the villagers know that they are expected to join them so as ultimately to do the whole work themselves, they may be sure that they will find that the villagers will sooner or later co operate.
('66', 189, 1, 16, 340556) At least such is my experience of South Africa and Champaran, and even during the quick walking tour in Orissa last year.
('66', 189, 1, 17, 340678) Lanes and streets have to be cleansed of all the rubbish which sould be classified.
('66', 189, 1, 18, 340762) There are portions which can be turned into manure, portions which have simply to be buried and portions which can be directly turned into wealth.
('66', 189, 1, 19, 340909) Every bone picked up is valuable raw material from which useful articles can be made or which can be crushed into rich manure.
('66', 189, 1, 20, 341036) Rags and waste paper can be turned into paper, and excreta picked up are golden manure for the village fields.
('66', 189, 1, 21, 341147) The way to treat the excreta is to mix them, liquid as well as solid, with superficial earth in soil dug no deeper than one foot at the most.
('66', 189, 1, 22, 341289) In his book on rural hygiene, Dr. Poore says that excreta should be buried in earth no deeper than nine to twelve inches (I am quoting from memory).
('66', 189, 1, 23, 341438) The author contends that the superficial earth is charged with minute life, which, together with light and air which
('66', 190, 0, 1, 341555) VOL.66:16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 191
('66', 190, 1, 2, 341599) easily penetrate it, turn the excreta into good, soft, sweet smelling soil within a week.
('66', 190, 1, 3, 341689) Any villager can test this for himself.
('66', 190, 1, 4, 341729) The way to do it is either to have fixed latrines, with earthen or iron buckets, and empty the contents in properly prepared places from day to day, or to perform the functions directly on to the ground dug up in squares.
('66', 190, 1, 5, 341951) The excreta can either be buried in a village common or in individual fields.
('66', 190, 1, 6, 342029) This can only be done by the co operation of the villagers.
('66', 190, 1, 7, 342089) At the worst, an enterprising villager can collect the excreta and turn them into wealth for himself.
('66', 190, 1, 8, 342191) At present, this rich manure, valued at lakhs of rupees, runs to waste every day, fouls the air and brings disease into the bargain.
('66', 190, 1, 9, 342324) Village tanks are promiscuously used for bathing, washing clothes and drinking and cooking purposes.
('66', 190, 1, 10, 342425) Many village tanks are also used by cattle.
('66', 190, 1, 11, 342469) Buffaloes are often to be seen wallowing in them.
('66', 190, 1, 12, 342519) The wonder is that, in spite of this sinful misuse of village tanks, villages have not been destroyed by epidemics.
('66', 190, 1, 13, 342635) It is the universal medical evidence that this neglect to ensure purity of the water supply of villages is responsible for many of the diseases suffered by the villagers.
('66', 190, 1, 14, 342806) This, it will be admitted, is a gloriously interesting and instructive service, fraught with incalculable benefit to the suffering humanity of India.
('66', 190, 1, 15, 342956) I hope it is clear from my description of the way in which the problem should be tackled, that, given willing workers who will wield the broom and the shovel with the same ease and pride as the pen and the pencil, the question of expense is almost whollyeliminated.
('66', 190, 1, 16, 343222) All the outlay that will be required is confined to a broom, a basket, a shovel and a pickaxe, and possibly some disinfectant.
('66', 190, 1, 17, 343349) Dry ashes are, perhaps, as effective a disinfectant as any that a chemist can supply.
('66', 190, 1, 18, 343435) But here let philanthropic chemists tell us what is the most effective and cheap village disinfectant that villagers can improvise in their villages.

('66', 193, 2, 3, 346686) DEAR SATISBABU,
('66', 193, 3, 4, 346702) I have not heard from you for ages as it were.
('66', 193, 3, 5, 346749) This I write to you to say that in spite of the pressure of work, I could not day after day face the two files of your book and yet pass them by.
('66', 193, 3, 6, 346895) I have therefore taken up the first part, and I shall religiously devote a few minutes to it till I have finished.
('66', 193, 3, 7, 347010) As it is unrevised, I see there are many errors.
('66', 193, 3, 8, 347059) I shall not attempt to correct them all, because that will mean a great deal of time.
('66', 193, 3, 9, 347145) But I will correct those which I can without having to give more time.
('66', 193, 3, 10, 347216) I want to open a questions column in Harijan if you will answer them regularly yourself or by deputy.
('66', 193, 3, 11, 347318) You can coin questions yourself, as, for instance, how to make soap out of crude village soda and seed oil.
('66', 193, 3, 12, 347426) How can you substitute paraffin by some village oil?
('66', 193, 3, 13, 347479) How can you make good durable ink out of village material?
('66', 193, 3, 14, 347538) Many such questions will arise as the movement progresses.

('66', 194, 4, 9, 348212) Therefore, if Kalibabu relieves you earlier, you should come at once so that I can allot your task whilst we are still settling down.

('66', 194, 9, 16, 348654) MY DEAR ABDUL ALIM,
('66', 194, 10, 17, 348674) I had your letter of 12th December last which was lying hidden in the file of letters left by Satisbabu for me to read.
('66', 194, 10, 18, 348794) On taking up the file, I found your letter.
('66', 194, 10, 19, 348838) I hope the effects of famine have lessened.
('66', 194, 10, 20, 348882) Though you say that a sound mind cannot be generally in an unsound body, we often see that mind triumphs over the body and becomes sound even though the body may not respond.
('66', 194, 10, 21, 349057) Therefore you have to strive and achieve your triumph over the diseased body, and it may be that even the body will respond to the mind.
('66', 194, 10, 22, 349194) But whether it does or not, your mind will be free.

('66', 195, 2, 12, 350268) You did not go in search of the responsibility which has fallen on you.
('66', 195, 2, 13, 350340) On the contrary it has been thrust upon you.
('66', 195, 2, 14, 350385) You have modestly accepted it as your duty and your good lies in the fulfilment of it.
('66', 195, 2, 15, 350472) Moreover the work you have taken up is clearly defined.
('66', 195, 2, 16, 350528) So you will have no difficulty.

('66', 196, 10, 19, 352050) I want to look at it and examine it after removing the husk.
('66', 196, 10, 20, 352111) It is not very necessary to have a man for pounding.
('66', 196, 10, 21, 352164) The husk can be removed by grinding ordinary paddy in a small hand mill and separating the husk.
('66', 196, 10, 22, 352261) Anyone can do this.
('66', 196, 10, 23, 352281) The necessity of a man for pounding arises only for polishing the rice.
('66', 196, 10, 24, 352353) That needs a little skill.
('66', 196, 10, 25, 352380) But we do not want to polish the rice.
('66', 196, 10, 26, 352419) There is a variety of paddy whose husk is so stuck to the grain that it can only be removed with great difficulty.
('66', 196, 10, 27, 352534) The husk from such paddy can be easily separated by steaming it first as in the case of whole pulses.
('66', 196, 10, 28, 352636) This is how it is usually done.

('66', 197, 7, 11, 353246) I have your very kind letter.
('66', 197, 7, 12, 353276) My considered opinion on your suggestion is that if you still think that its publication is required in the common interest, you should refer the question to Sir Samuel Hoare and Lord Halifax.
('66', 197, 7, 13, 353469) If both of them desire publication, as distinguished from merely permitting it, you may publish it with an adequate preface.
('66', 197, 7, 14, 353594) At this end, my presentiment tells me that its circulation amongst the politicians whose opinion counts should be enough.

('66', 197, 13, 21, 353948) I have just received and read your letter of 29th ultimo.
('66', 197, 13, 22, 354006) Please send the enclosed 1 to Mr. Heath.
('66', 197, 13, 23, 354047) I am sending it under the same cover to save a few good annas.
('66', 197, 13, 24, 354110) This letter will be airmailed to you.

('66', 198, 1, 2, 354219) One part of your letter, therefore, is answered in my letter to Mr. Heath.
('66', 198, 2, 3, 354294) Now for the non attendance at Mr. Raza Ali’s tea party.
('66', 198, 2, 4, 354350) Whenever such invitations have come to me by design, there has been intimation given to me of it.
('66', 198, 2, 5, 354448) Here it was a most casual invitation.
('66', 198, 2, 6, 354486) Two days before the receipt of it, Raza Ali himself had seen me and engaged me in a heart to heart conversation about his mission in South Africa.
('66', 198, 2, 7, 354633) He had arranged for the party already before he came to me.
('66', 198, 2, 8, 354693) But he did not even inquire whether I would attend it.
('66', 198, 2, 9, 354748) If I had received the invitation when he came, I would have opened the conversation myself.
('66', 198, 2, 10, 354840) But I knew nothing of the party then, naturally nothing therefore of the invitation.
('66', 198, 2, 11, 354925) The invitation card was buried in a heap of papers unacknowledged.
('66', 198, 2, 12, 354992) Suddenly, the evening previous to the function, I thought that I must at least acknowledge it.
('66', 198, 2, 13, 355087) And so, early in the morning (it was bitterly cold) I sent the note of which you have a copy.
('66', 198, 2, 14, 355181) It was delivered by Pyarelal personally to Raza Ali.
('66', 198, 2, 15, 355234) It was so delivered and sent so early in order that if there was any meaning behind the invitation I should know.
('66', 198, 2, 16, 355348) Pyarelal saw Raza Ali.
('66', 198, 2, 17, 355371) The latter beyond expressing his regret that I was not going said nothing.
('66', 198, 2, 18, 355446) I concluded that there was no meaning behind it, and I had no time to waste in going to a function in which I could have no interest, and the like of which I never attend except [those] with some honourable purpose behind them.
('66', 198, 2, 19, 355674) Here there was none.
('66', 198, 2, 20, 355695) Indeed I felt that the Viceroy and everybody might even be embarrassed if I responded to a courteous invitation which the sender felt bound to send but would be glad if it was not accepted.
('66', 198, 2, 21, 355885) This is the whole of the reason behind my non acceptance.
('66', 198, 3, 22, 355943) At the time I wrote the letter, so far as I can now recall, I knew nothing of the invitations to Congress M. L. A. s.
('66', 198, 3, 23, 356061) In any case, my non acceptance had no connection with their non acceptance.
('66', 198, 3, 24, 356137) For them there was no other way.
('66', 198, 3, 25, 356170) I was consulted about their attitude and I had given the opinion that they could not accept the invitation.
('66', 198, 3, 26, 356278) But had I known that I was wanted at the meeting for the purpose of breaking the ice, I would unhesitatingly have gone.
('66', 198, 3, 27, 356398) I am no longer a Congress member; and whilst I do nothing that would compromise the Congress because of my past connection with it, I would not hesitate to take action that Congressmen could not possibly take without diminishing the prestige of the Congress.
('66', 198, 3, 28, 356657) I hope this explains to you the whole of my position.
('66', 198, 3, 29, 356711) I have since learnt that the Viceroy would
('66', 199, 0, 1, 356754) 200 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 199, 1, 2, 356796) have been glad if I had gone.
('66', 199, 1, 3, 356826) But I do not know whether that was a thought after the event or before.
('66', 199, 1, 4, 356898) If it was before, a mere hint would have sufficed to send me to the tea party.
('66', 199, 1, 5, 356977) And previous hints have invariably been given to me on such occasions I have C. F. Andrew’s letter.
('66', 199, 1, 6, 357077) If he is still there, you will tell him, if not there, you will write to him saying that I shall not act hastily in whatever I may do and that ought to free him from all anxiety complex.

('66', 199, 6, 11, 357407) February 10, 1935
('66', 199, 7, 12, 357425) MY DEAR SASTRI,
('66', 199, 8, 13, 357441) I have your long letter, but none too long for your argument.
('66', 199, 8, 14, 357503) The only argument that will be decisive is about the desirability of publication in Madras from the Harijan point of view itself.
('66', 199, 8, 15, 357633) From your letter I gather that the existence of Harijan in Madras is a good thing and has proved its usefulness during the time it has been published there.
('66', 199, 8, 16, 357790) I would like you to develop the argument further and show me if you can, in a concrete manner, why you think that it would be good to retain it in Madras.
('66', 199, 8, 17, 357945) You won’t say that publication in Poona will not, in any shape or form, influence public opinion.
('66', 199, 8, 18, 358043) The question, therefore, will be one of degree only.
('66', 199, 8, 19, 358096) But I would accept the validity of the argument even if you convince me that its usefulness is greater in Madras than in Poona.
('66', 199, 8, 20, 358224) Since you have raised that question, for which I was not prepared, I am writing 1 to Dewan Bahadur Bhashyam Iyengar and Shri Venkatasubbayya.
('66', 199, 8, 21, 358366) So far as your own emoluments and your connection with me are concerned, both will be unaffected.
('66', 199, 8, 22, 358464) Your living connection will remain as it is whilst you are

('66', 200, 1, 3, 358635) Therefore that consideration has to be eliminated.
('66', 200, 1, 4, 358686) But if you are to be paid as editor, then your expenses should come from the Harijan receipts, and you have to make your editorship a living factor, which, so far as I can see today, it is not.
('66', 200, 1, 5, 358880) Please send a bound copy of all the numbers of Harijan, if we have copies from the start or from the time that they are procurable, to Prof.

('66', 200, 4, 15, 359362) February 10, 1935 DEAR NARAYANA REDDY,
('66', 200, 5, 16, 359401) I have your letter.
('66', 200, 5, 17, 359421) I am sorry I can’t send your suggestion for publication in Harijan.
('66', 200, 5, 18, 359489) You are altogether wrong in thinking that I have started the village industries work because I believe that Harijan work is finished or because I have now transferred my love to something else.
('66', 200, 5, 19, 359683) Village industry is a natural consequence of intense Harijan propaganda and complementary of it.
('66', 200, 5, 20, 359780) You will see from the items that I have taken up that they affect Harijans first and foremost.
('66', 200, 5, 21, 359875) It is they who live only on rice or atta and salt.
('66', 200, 5, 22, 359926) If they get wholesome atta and rice, surely it is good, and if I agitated that they alone should eat unpolished rice and whole ground wheats they won’t understand it and the proposition can never be carried.
('66', 200, 5, 23, 360134) Then again, the majority of those who were engaged in the husking of paddy were Harijans.
('66', 200, 5, 24, 360224) It is they who have been displaced by the monstrous mills.
('66', 200, 5, 25, 360283) You ought to under stand that if the movement for better sanitation succeeds, so far as the Harijan scavengers are concerned the problem is solved, as it can be solved in no other fashion.
('66', 200, 5, 26, 360472) All the four items with which you would start your mission are having attention for over two years.
('66', 200, 5, 27, 360572) I am loath to believe that up to now you have not been following the

('66', 201, 8, 11, 360983) I have your letter.
('66', 201, 8, 12, 361003) Agricultural improvement, I am fully aware, is essential for the prosperity of India’s millions.
('66', 201, 8, 13, 361100) But I see many difficulties in our way if there is no active State aid.
('66', 201, 8, 14, 361172) Nevertheless, if you will send me your first bulletin, I will go through it, and if I find it to be suitable for the pages of Harijan, I will gladly publish it.
('66', 201, 8, 15, 361333) It will have to be authentic, that is, with authority for every assertion made in it.

('66', 201, 14, 22, 361601) In my haste to send you my reply by return post I forgot to refer to one matter which you mentioned in your first letter, namely, your desire to be with me for some time, if not for the balance of the evening of your life.
('66', 201, 14, 23, 361824) Of course, you will be welcomed, whether you come for a few days or whether you come and take up your abode permanently.
('66', 201, 14, 24, 361945) As you may know, I am now living with the staff of the All India Village Industries Association on a site that has been donated by Jamnalalji.
('66', 201, 14, 25, 362088) We are running a common kitchen.

('66', 202, 16, 26, 362924) I see that paddy is first husked.
('66', 202, 16, 27, 362958) Let me know what kind of mill stones are used for it?

('66', 202, 16, 31, 363236) Or can it be husked immediately after it has been harvested?
('66', 202, 16, 32, 363297) How much is the husk?
('66', 202, 16, 33, 363319) How much paddy can be husked in an hour?
('66', 202, 16, 34, 363360) What is its cost?

('66', 203, 9, 11, 363730) I read both your letters and was distressed.
('66', 203, 9, 12, 363775) I have not done a thing for you and what could I have possibly done?
('66', 203, 9, 13, 363844) It was not right to go [and live] in the jungle.
('66', 203, 9, 14, 363893) If you will but listen to me, you will come here.
('66', 203, 9, 15, 363943) All your troubles will disappear.
('66', 203, 9, 16, 363977) I have written to Devdas to send you here.

('66', 203, 9, 18, 364086) You can go back when all the rest have shifted to Harijan Colony.
('66', 203, 9, 19, 364152) What can you do by living there at present except cause me anxiety?
('66', 203, 9, 20, 364220) If you are not agreeable to my suggestion, you may live with Devdas.
('66', 203, 9, 21, 364289) But you must leave Harijan Colony whether or not you agree even to the latter course.
('66', 203, 9, 22, 364375) And I reiterate that I cannot compel Sharma.

('66', 204, 4, 6, 364810) I must tackle the manuscript only when I get the time.
('66', 204, 4, 7, 364865) I do not favour the ideal of village dispensaries.
('66', 204, 4, 8, 364916) What I would like is to give the villagers sound instruction in elementary hygiene and sanitation.
('66', 204, 4, 9, 365015) It is easy enough to give them instruction in preventive measures.
('66', 204, 4, 10, 365082) And side by side with that, they may be given a knowledge of bazaar medicines and their effective use.
('66', 204, 4, 11, 365185) So far as the use of bazaar medicines is concerned, the more I understand village life the more I realize how much they know of the value of indigenous drugs.
('66', 204, 4, 12, 365344) Dispensaries for the7,00,000 villages of India is almost an impossible proposition unless we have State control.
('66', 204, 4, 13, 365457) Drugs, whether allopathic or ayurvedic, are expensive even when they are sold cheap—I mean expensive compared to the cost of bazaar medicines.

('66', 204, 10, 21, 365936) Your Hindi writing is quite good.
('66', 204, 10, 22, 365970) You have no difficulty in expressing yourself correctly.
('66', 204, 10, 23, 366027) And why do you expect me to laugh at your English?
('66', 204, 10, 24, 366078) It is a wretched habit we have cultivated of not merely wanting to write perfectly grammatical English but also criticizing those who do not, whereas the very best men on the Continent think nothing of their mistakes in writing English.
('66', 204, 10, 25, 366315) They concentrate only on correctly giving their meaning.

('66', 205, 1, 2, 366414) I am glad you are arranging to have the device put up at the Ashram for the hand pounding of rice.
('66', 205, 1, 3, 366513) But evidently you are all still labouring under a mistake.
('66', 205, 1, 4, 366572) You do not want the pestle and mortar that is required for polishing.
('66', 205, 1, 5, 366642) The removing of husk is done by grinding on a very light chakki.
('66', 205, 1, 6, 366707) I have now discovered that chakkis for grinding are made of wood or pure mud for the simple reason that it is only the outer husk we want to remove without damaging the inner grain which can’t bear much weight.
('66', 205, 1, 7, 366918) It is, therefore, a performance which even a child can undertake without any strain.
('66', 205, 1, 8, 367003) No further process is required for preparing the rice for cooking.
('66', 205, 1, 9, 367070) My food is tomatoes, milk, almond paste and some bhaji, ordinarily palak, methi or luni.
('66', 205, 1, 10, 367159) I have given up fruit just to reduce the cost.
('66', 205, 1, 11, 367206) It is purely an experiment.
('66', 205, 1, 12, 367234) I am keeping up weight at 109 lb.
('66', 205, 1, 13, 367268) We are now living in the garden which you once visited.
('66', 205, 1, 14, 367324) Prabhavati comes here every evening and passes the night here.
('66', 205, 1, 15, 367387) Ramdas is in Bombay trying to regain health and confidence in himself.
('66', 205, 1, 16, 367458) He is not doing badly.
('66', 205, 1, 17, 367481) Ambujam must have told you that the three girls who were to come to Madras do not want to, and I do not want to force them.
('66', 205, 1, 18, 367605) Therefore, if you are opening the Ashram, you should do so without any fuss or ceremony.
('66', 205, 1, 19, 367694) In that case you can start even with one girl as I have said to Ambujam in my talks with her.
('66', 205, 1, 20, 367788) Vasumati will gladly come if she is still required.
('66', 205, 1, 21, 367840) She is here for the purpose of going to Madras.
('66', 205, 1, 22, 367888) It may be inadvisable to bring her down there merely for the sake of two girls.
('66', 205, 1, 23, 367968) They can have such carding and ginning as Ambujam herself knows.
('66', 205, 1, 24, 368033) But if both of you require Vasumati, she will fulfil her promise.
('66', 205, 1, 25, 368099) I have just received Ambujam’s letter.
('66', 205, 1, 26, 368138) She may have to give more attention to her son than she expected.
('66', 205, 1, 27, 368204) In that case you should be prepared to take charge of the Ashram.
('66', 205, 1, 28, 368270) Can you do so?
('66', 205, 1, 29, 368285) I hope you can.

('66', 206, 3, 4, 368510) DEAR GIRIJABABU,
('66', 206, 4, 5, 368527) I have your letter.
('66', 206, 4, 6, 368547) I have never asked Harijans to give up their poultry or anything else but carrion, beef eating and intoxicants.
('66', 206, 4, 7, 368659) They are certainly at liberty to take poultry, goats, sheep and whatever else they like and whatever other Hindus can lawfully take.
('66', 206, 4, 8, 368792) It will certainly be a great thing if you succeed in getting Harijan weavers to do their own spinning amongst their families.
('66', 206, 4, 9, 368918) Every one of such families will always be able to keep the wolf from the door if they will adopt this method of combining spinning with weaving.
('66', 206, 4, 10, 369063) I suggested it to nearly 10,000 weavers during the march near Sakhigopal.

('66', 206, 10, 20, 369550) It requires a great deal of thinking out and can only be done under very strict discipline.

('66', 210, 7, 22, 374668) Even though the temple dates back to 1907 the real pranpratistha 2 of Shri Laxminarayan, according to Gandhiji took place on the day when the trustees of the temple opened it to Harijans.
('66', 210, 7, 23, 374856) Since that day, Shri Laxminarayan could as well be called Daridranarayana, meaning God of the most helpless, as untouchables are today.
('66', 210, 8, 24, 374992) With the word Daridranarayana, villagers who are at present most discarded and heavily oppressed, came before his vision.
('66', 210, 8, 25, 375114) He said that service of villagers was service of God.

('66', 211, 2, 4, 375514) He referred to the five items of the A.I.V.I.A. programme, and asked the people to use chakki flour, unpolished village husked rice, gur and country ghani oil.
('66', 211, 3, 5, 375674) He told them of the advantages of using hand chakki flour, etc., and convinced the audience that their use would benefit the village producers and consumers.
('66', 211, 4, 6, 375832) He also referred to village sanitation and its importance in relation to village health.
('66', 211, 4, 7, 375921) He directed the attention of the public to the fact that people in Sindh, near Wardha, eased on roadsides, and said that they should refrain from this habit.
('66', 211, 5, 8, 376079) He concluded his speech with the hope that Wardha would co operate with the A. I. V. I. A. in the village work undertaken by it.

('66', 211, 8, 11, 376268) WARDHA, February 12, 1935
('66', 211, 9, 12, 376294) MY DEAR MALKANI,
('66', 211, 10, 13, 376311) You must have thought that I had forgotten all about the bye laws, or perhaps, having gone to Assam, you have forgottenthem altogether.
('66', 211, 10, 14, 376447) And if you did so, you would be quite right, for I had taken over the burden from your shoulders.
('66', 211, 10, 15, 376545) But I had not forgotten them at all.
('66', 211, 10, 16, 376582) I returned to them again and again, but could not do anything.
('66', 211, 10, 17, 376645) I had to read up the whole of the constitution anew in order to reply to the three posers from Dewan Bahadur Bhashyam Iyengar.
('66', 211, 11, 18, 376772) And I realize why I could not frame them.
('66', 211, 11, 19, 376814) There is nothing more to do than what you have done already.
('66', 211, 11, 20, 376875) The constitution itself is so full that, beyond what you have drawn up about accounts and the like, no further provision is necessary.
('66', 211, 11, 21, 377010) The function of bye laws is to provide for certain routine work which cannot very well be provided for in the main law.
('66', 211, 11, 22, 377130) Bye laws, therefore, are framed from time to time as the necessity for them arises.
('66', 211, 11, 23, 377214) They must not take the place of administrative instructions or of resolutions that may be passed from time to time.
('66', 211, 11, 24, 377330) Early this morning, I was reading your instructions on the

('66', 212, 1, 2, 377510) constitution.
('66', 212, 1, 3, 377524) You will remember you gave a copy to me two or three days before I left Delhi.
('66', 212, 1, 4, 377603) I was never able to read them before early this morning.
('66', 212, 1, 5, 377660) Having read them, I felt confirmed that neither I nor you had to draw anything just now.
('66', 212, 1, 6, 377749) Your instructions are good and very business like.
('66', 212, 1, 7, 377800) Even what you have drawn up in the name of bye laws are hardly such.
('66', 212, 1, 8, 377869) But if you want to have something which you should call by the name of bye laws, what you have drawn up will pass muster.
('66', 212, 1, 9, 377991) I take it that you have kept copies of your draft.
('66', 212, 1, 10, 378042) If you have not, I can send it.
('66', 212, 1, 11, 378074) It is not yet destroyed.
('66', 212, 1, 12, 378099) Did I write to you that I had already written to Dialdas, and asked Thakkar Bapa to transfer his donation to the account for which he wanted it to be used?
('66', 212, 2, 13, 378255) An account of your Assam experiences I expect in the form of a note for Harijan.
('66', 212, 2, 14, 378336) When do you shift the office to the Harijan Home?
('66', 212, 2, 15, 378386) What is it to be finally known as?

('66', 212, 7, 21, 378587) February 12, 1935
('66', 212, 8, 22, 378605) MY DEAR JAYARAMDAS,
('66', 212, 9, 23, 378625) It was good to have something from you after so many years even though it was a telegram.
('66', 212, 9, 24, 378715) You are surely very unpractical.
('66', 212, 9, 25, 378748) Malaria has been raging in Ceylon for some months now.
('66', 212, 9, 26, 378803) Why not a word from you up to now?
('66', 212, 9, 27, 378838) And then, a telegram?
('66', 212, 9, 28, 378860) You should know that I had made investigations, and I was told that there was no need to send anything from here, that all the relief work was being done by government and that there were enough doctors also.
('66', 212, 9, 29, 379069) Of course, all this may be fully wrong.
('66', 212, 9, 30, 379109) But what can I do?
('66', 212, 9, 31, 379128) Those who sent me appeals have been able to send me nothing except newspaper cuttings.

('66', 213, 1, 2, 379307) It means that they themselves know nothing of the affected areas.
('66', 213, 1, 3, 379373) If you know something, you should give chapter and verse which I can publish.
('66', 213, 1, 4, 379451) It must be the evidence of your own senses, not any hearsay.
('66', 213, 1, 5, 379512) You must say also who are the villagers that are affected.
('66', 213, 1, 6, 379571) Not that it matters who they are, but surely the public ought to know who are affected, why they are affected, why their neighbours were not affected, or is the disease universal in Ceylon?
('66', 213, 1, 7, 379761) These are all relevant questions.
('66', 213, 1, 8, 379795) After all, I have no money of my own.
('66', 213, 1, 9, 379833) I call only make an appeal to the charitable public.
('66', 213, 1, 10, 379886) I cannot do so unless I can certify the veracity of the statements that come to me.
('66', 213, 1, 11, 379970) If you can do that thing for me, it will be good.

('66', 213, 8, 19, 380206) I have your letter.
('66', 213, 8, 20, 380226) I have already written to Janammal.
('66', 213, 8, 21, 380262) 1 If you devote your remaining time to your son, it will be the best service you can render to the country.
('66', 213, 8, 22, 380370) He has got to be looked after by somebody as a member of the State as much as the tallest citizen, and therefore demands State attention.
('66', 213, 8, 23, 380508) Who can be better fitted than his mother to give it?
('66', 213, 8, 24, 380561) All this argument would be mischievous and hypocritical if he had a selfish mother.
('66', 213, 8, 25, 380645) If, as a result of tender care, he turns out to be a good servant of the country, surely it would be no small gain.
('66', 213, 8, 26, 380761) I should not mind, therefore, your making his welfare your main purpose at the present moment.
('66', 213, 8, 27, 380856) That would not interfere with your other services.
('66', 213, 8, 28, 380907) You will still be able to give some attention to Hindi, some attention to Harijans, some attention to khadi and some attention to village industries.
('66', 213, 8, 29, 381057) Your whole personal life would be guided always in accordance with the principles underlying these things.
('66', 213, 8, 30, 381164) If your son can remain with you in the proposed Ashram, he should be with you, for at the present moment it is wholly unnecessary for you to advertise

('66', 214, 1, 3, 381412) You can quietly take in a few girls and look after them.
('66', 214, 1, 4, 381469) But if a settled life is impossible and you have to travel about with your son, you should give up the idea of taking in the girls unless Janammal will shoulder the responsibility.
('66', 214, 1, 5, 381650) In all circumstances you must keep cheerful.

('66', 215, 12, 20, 383557) DEAR MEHRTAJ,
('66', 215, 13, 21, 383571) You ought to have written to me long ago.
('66', 215, 13, 22, 383613) Nevertheless I was glad to have your letter.
('66', 215, 13, 23, 383658) I am awaiting a reply from Father to my last letter 1, which is due to reach me any day.
('66', 215, 13, 24, 383747) I had a cursory glance through Baba’s speech.
('66', 215, 13, 25, 383793) I saw that it was well received and that it was to the point.
('66', 215, 13, 26, 383855) Did you get from Zohra or Dr. Ansari the shawl you wanted and I had promised?
('66', 215, 13, 27, 383933) It was chosen by Zohra.
('66', 215, 13, 28, 383957) If you got it, did you like it?
('66', 215, 13, 29, 383989) Of course it was paid for by Zohra.
('66', 215, 13, 30, 384025) That is how I fulfil my promises, for I have no money of my own.
('66', 215, 13, 31, 384090) I can only beg.
('66', 215, 13, 32, 384106) And now Father too has very little money of his own.

('66', 216, 12, 24, 385067) I have your letter.
('66', 216, 12, 25, 385087) I liked it immensely.
('66', 216, 12, 26, 385109) Mistrust had arisen because Amtussalaam had written very strongly.
('66', 216, 12, 27, 385176) It is no ordinary matter to be my associate.
('66', 216, 12, 28, 385221) To renounce everything, to renounce attachment and to rejoice in the renunciation is not within everyone’s power.
('66', 216, 12, 29, 385335) You have given up numerous things but so long as you do not have inner realization how can you have inner joy?
('66', 216, 12, 30, 385446) And one who lacks inner joy is prone to anger, to sickness and may be up to anything.

('66', 217, 1, 2, 385574) I shall now consider all that you write as coming from the heart.
('66', 217, 1, 3, 385640) You must understand that there is a little difficulty here and the reason for the difficulty is your hastiness, your anger, and if, in your haste and anger you should write something and I accept it as trulymeant, it will not be right.
('66', 217, 1, 4, 385876) But I see no alternative if I am to deal with you.
('66', 217, 1, 5, 385927) I like your keeping a cow but bear in mind that you are not to incur any debt.
('66', 217, 1, 6, 386006) Your contact with the Harijans is also to the good.
('66', 217, 2, 7, 386058) The thought of your medical studies occurs to me daily.
('66', 217, 2, 8, 386114) I have written to Dr. Ansari but there is no saying when he will answer.
('66', 217, 2, 9, 386187) 1 And how can we complain?
('66', 217, 2, 10, 386214) He takes up more work than he is equal to.
('66', 217, 3, 11, 386257) I do not know which is the better thing.
('66', 217, 3, 12, 386298) I have no information regarding the curriculum in Madras but I can find out.
('66', 217, 3, 13, 386375) It will not be possible for you to live with a surgeon.
('66', 217, 3, 14, 386431) Would you be willing to go alone?
('66', 217, 3, 15, 386465) I could not bear to have Draupadi living in Khurja all by herself.
('66', 217, 3, 16, 386532) What appeals to me most is for her to be with me, work for me and put up with Ba’s temper.
('66', 217, 3, 17, 386623) Your task and mine will become easier when she is prepared for this.
('66', 217, 3, 18, 386692) I have built many hopes on you.
('66', 217, 3, 19, 386724) I feel I can take much service from you once you have rid yourself of all your blemishes.
('66', 217, 3, 20, 386814) After all even if you go to the West I could never agree to Draupadi and the children accompanying you, because I consider it unnecessary.
('66', 217, 3, 21, 386953) If I am prepared to send you, it is only to disillusion you about the West.
('66', 217, 3, 22, 387029) True nature cure is to be found in the villages.
('66', 217, 3, 23, 387078) All the knowledge the West has to offer can be got from the books.
('66', 217, 3, 24, 387145) The rest is to come only from the villages.
('66', 217, 3, 25, 387189) And in the end the service we wish to render will be to the villagers.
('66', 217, 3, 26, 387260) Think over all this and tell me what you consider it is best to do.
('66', 217, 3, 27, 387328) Can Draupadi stay with me?
('66', 217, 4, 28, 387355) Your time table is good.
('66', 217, 4, 29, 387380) What books do you read and what do you teach the children?
('66', 217, 5, 30, 387439) Is the flour ground at home?
('66', 217, 5, 31, 387468) Is the rice unpolished?
('66', 217, 5, 32, 387492) I have only now learnt that unpolished rice does not come to the market at all.
('66', 217, 5, 33, 387572) I hear that it is very easy to husk rice without polishing it.
('66', 217, 5, 34, 387635) I have grown some paddy and intend to try and get it husked here.

('66', 218, 8, 10, 388104) I have your separate letters.
('66', 218, 8, 11, 388134) I will reply to Dool’s letter.
('66', 218, 8, 12, 388165) You should both get acquainted with the new agent.
('66', 218, 8, 13, 388216) I had a casual talk with him about you.
('66', 218, 8, 14, 388256) I have most probably written to you about it.
('66', 218, 8, 15, 388302) Manilal can be said to have done well in Rhodesia.
('66', 218, 8, 16, 388353) Sushila has given a considerably good account of settlers there.
('66', 218, 8, 17, 388418) What do the expenses of the two of you come to?
('66', 218, 8, 18, 388466) You must be making up a statement of accounts every year or every six months.
('66', 218, 8, 19, 388544) So send me a copy of the latest.
('66', 218, 8, 20, 388577) Sushila has asked me a question about sugar cane juice.
('66', 218, 8, 21, 388633) It has the same properties as jaggery, only in a larger measure.
('66', 218, 8, 22, 388698) A man can retain strength and survive for some time on sugar cane juice only.
('66', 218, 8, 23, 388776) It is laxative if taken hot.
('66', 218, 8, 24, 388805) One who takes sugar cane juice does not need sugar or jaggery at all.
('66', 218, 8, 25, 388875) Either hot or cold sugar cane juice should be taken with a lemon squeezed into it.
('66', 218, 8, 26, 388958) What its other qualities are over and above this I do not know.
('66', 218, 8, 27, 389022) You must have received a lengthy letter I wrote to you about Sita’s education.
('66', 218, 8, 28, 389101) 2 Ramdas has completely given up the idea of going there.
('66', 218, 8, 29, 389159) At present there is no question of my going to jail.
('66', 218, 8, 30, 389212) One could say it is not likely till the month of May.
('66', 218, 8, 31, 389266) The German who called on you was Khuro.
('66', 218, 8, 32, 389306) However, there was also an Englishman who stayed with me.
('66', 218, 8, 33, 389364) His name is Rees Jones.
('66', 218, 8, 34, 389388) He stays permanently in Durban and I had asked him to go to Phoenix.

('66', 219, 6, 18, 390109) The previous one was also received.
('66', 219, 6, 19, 390145) Perhaps it is still lying in the office.

('66', 219, 6, 21, 390317) You have done well in reducing the quantity of milk.
('66', 219, 6, 22, 390370) You will get the necessary nourishment if you continue to take raw vegetables and fruit.
('66', 219, 6, 23, 390459) By way of raw vegetables you can have spinach, luni, cabbage, radish, carrots, turnips, fenugreek leaves and mustard leaves.
('66', 219, 6, 24, 390584) You can also have tender leaves of radish, turnips and carrots.
('66', 219, 6, 25, 390648) You can increase the intake of raw vegetables gradually by an ounce every day, but do not take more than 8 ounces of it.
('66', 219, 6, 26, 390769) You can have with it papawa, lemons, bananas, raisins, etc.

('66', 220, 3, 4, 391374) BHAI RAJENDRABABU, I replied to your letter by a telegram but Rajaji arrived here yesterday.
('66', 220, 3, 5, 391467) The fact is that on hearing the news I sent a wire and a letter too in reply to the correspondent’s wire.
('66', 220, 3, 6, 391573) He has sent the following reply:
('66', 220, 4, 7, 391606) We have no further information than what has appeared in the newspapers which may be consulted.
('66', 220, 4, 8, 391702) The funds are collected by the Government.
('66', 220, 4, 9, 391745) Upon this I telegraphed to Rajaji to send someone to Ceylon.
('66', 220, 4, 10, 391806) He either wrote or sent a wire to his friend who answered that no outside help was needed.
('66', 220, 4, 11, 391897) Since then I have been silent.
('66', 220, 4, 12, 391928) In my opinion someone should be sent there before any appeal is issued and that we have to do.
('66', 220, 4, 13, 392023) Only a man of standing should go.
('66', 220, 4, 14, 392057) Anyway my mind is at peace.
('66', 220, 4, 15, 392085) The day before yesterday a wire reached me from someone who had been at the Ashram.
('66', 220, 4, 16, 392169) He too has supplied no facts.
('66', 220, 4, 17, 392199) I have asked 1 him to let me know what exactly happened and shall write to you further on hearing from him.
('66', 220, 4, 18, 392307) I have had a talk with Rajaji.
('66', 220, 4, 19, 392338) He expresses the same opinion as he did before.
('66', 220, 4, 20, 392386) You will do what you think best.
('66', 220, 4, 21, 392419) I hope you are keeping well.

('66', 220, 9, 27, 392607) MY DEAR RAMACHANDRAN, Devdas told me all about it.
('66', 220, 9, 28, 392658) Then I read the correspondence and now Kanti is here.
('66', 220, 9, 29, 392712) He will remain with me.
('66', 220, 9, 30, 392736) So far as I can see it has been all a mental, one sided affair, the poor little girl knowing nothing.

('66', 221, 1, 3, 393053) Of course for me, Kanti has fallen from the ideal which I had hoped he would live up to.
('66', 221, 1, 4, 393142) But what does his fall matter in the debris of many of my hopes?
('66', 221, 1, 5, 393207) I do not blame him, for he could not go against his fundamental being.
('66', 221, 1, 6, 393278) I do not know how far his conduct has hurt you.
('66', 221, 1, 7, 393326) I know you have forgiven him.
('66', 221, 1, 8, 393356) Good will come out of it if this discovery of his affection for the girl steadies him and makes him firm in his resolution that even if she makes another choice, he will love no other girl.
('66', 221, 1, 9, 393546) I see no harm in Kanti harbouring her in his bosom.
('66', 221, 1, 10, 393598) He is on corresponding terms with your sister.
('66', 221, 1, 11, 393645) You will now tell me without reserve what you will have me or Kanti to do.

('66', 222, 4, 5, 394655) You have been writing fairly regularly.
('66', 222, 4, 6, 394695) I certainly like your having stayed on there.
('66', 222, 4, 7, 394741) I want to see you glowing with health.
('66', 222, 4, 8, 394780) Body and mind are so closely connected with each other that the purity of one is to a large extent dependent on the purity of the other.
('66', 222, 4, 9, 394917) There is even a saying in English in support of this.
('66', 222, 4, 10, 394971) In one Upanishad a similar thing is said about food.
('66', 222, 4, 11, 395024) A man’s character is determined by the food he eats.
('66', 222, 4, 12, 395077) Doesn’t the line in the Gita, which says that from food grow living beings, suggest the same thing?
('66', 222, 4, 13, 395177) You should therefore become— you can become—perfectly healthy.
('66', 222, 4, 14, 395240) Consider this also a part of your study.

('66', 225, 7, 17, 399434) These leaves are to be had in every village for the trouble of picking.
('66', 225, 7, 18, 399506) And yet greens are supposed to be only a delicacy of cities.
('66', 225, 7, 19, 399567) Villagers in many parts of India live on dal and rice or roti, and plenty of chillies, which harm the system.
('66', 225, 7, 20, 399677) Since the economic reorganization of villages has been commenced with food reform it is necessary to find out the simplest and cheapest foods that would enable villagers to regain lost health.
('66', 225, 7, 21, 399870) The addition of green leaves to their meals will enable villagers to avoid many disease from which they are now suffering.
('66', 225, 7, 22, 399993) The villagers’ food is deficient in vitamins; many of them can be supplied by fresh green leaves.
('66', 225, 7, 23, 400091) An eminent English doctor told me in Delhi that a proper use of green leaves was calculated to revolutionize the customary notions of food and that much of what was today being supplied by milk might be supplied by green leaves.
('66', 225, 7, 24, 400320) That, of course, means elaborate research and examination in detail of the nourishing properties of the innumerable leaves that are to be found hidden among the grasses that grow wild in India.

('66', 226, 1, 2, 400590) For nearly five months I have been living entirely on uncooked foods.
('66', 226, 1, 3, 400660) I used to take what appeared to me an enormous quantity of a vegetable every day.
('66', 226, 1, 4, 400742) For the past five months I have been taking green leaves in the place of cooked leaves or other vegetable.
('66', 226, 1, 5, 400849) It then seemed to me monstrous that I should have to depend upon the Wardha bazaar for the few ounces of leaves I needed.
('66', 226, 1, 6, 400971) One fine morning Sjt.
('66', 226, 1, 7, 400993) Chhotelalji of the Wardha Ashram brought to me a leaf that was growing wild among the Ashram grasses.
('66', 226, 1, 8, 401095) It was luni.
('66', 226, 1, 9, 401108) I tried it, and it agreed with me.
('66', 226, 1, 10, 401143) Another day he brought chakwat.
('66', 226, 1, 11, 401175) That also agreed.
('66', 226, 1, 12, 401193) But before recommending these jungle leaves to the public, I thought I would have them botanically identified.
('66', 226, 1, 13, 401304) Here is the result, through the kind courtesy of Prof.
('66', 226, 1, 14, 401359) J. P. Trivedi.
('66', 226, 1, 15, 401374) The quotations are from Watt’s monumental volumes on The Economic Products of India.
('66', 226, 2, 16, 401459) Since these were received, I had introduced to me the leaves of sarsav, suva, turnip tops, carrot tops, radish tops and pea plant leaves.
('66', 226, 2, 17, 401597) Besides these, it is hardly necessary to state that the radish, turnip and carrot tubers are also known to be edible in their raw state.
('66', 226, 2, 18, 401734) It is waste of money and ‘good’ taste to cook these leaves or tubers.
('66', 226, 2, 19, 401804) The vitamins contained in these vegetables are wholly or partially lost in cooking.
('66', 226, 2, 20, 401888) I have called cooking these waste of ‘good’ taste, because the uncooked vegetables have a natural good taste of their own which is destroyed by cooking.

('66', 226, 5, 25, 402231) There is the literature on village industries, on indigenous herbs found for the picking on village fields, and specimens of articles manufactured in villages.

('66', 227, 3, 7, 403547) 332. ALL ABOUT RICE
('66', 227, 4, 8, 403567) The problem of rice is daily presenting interesting features.
('66', 227, 4, 9, 403629) Shri Shankerlal Banker has already commenced experiments unpolished rice.
('66', 227, 4, 10, 403703) He writes: 1
('66', 227, 5, 11, 403716) The only comment I would like to offer on this letter is that I do not think that any further medical opinion will help.
('66', 227, 5, 12, 403837) The opinion I have gathered and reproduced in these columns is emphatic in favour of unpolished rice.
('66', 227, 5, 13, 403939) But so far as I am aware we have nothing in medical literature describing experiments on which Shri Banker has, like many of us, made the commencement.
('66', 227, 5, 14, 404091) Proof of the pudding is in the eating; let everyone make the experiment for himself.
('66', 227, 5, 15, 404176) One caution, however, as a practised cook, I would like to utter.
('66', 227, 5, 16, 404242) Among the many domestic quarrels I used to have with my wife was one over rice cooking.
('66', 227, 5, 17, 404330) She would have every grain separated.
('66', 227, 5, 18, 404368) I had developed into a dietetic reformer and I knew that that rice was not half as good as that which was well and properly cooked.
('66', 227, 5, 19, 404500) Not an ounce of water in which I cooked rice was thrown away.
('66', 227, 5, 20, 404562) But at that time I knew no distinction between polished and unpolished rice.
('66', 227, 5, 21, 404639) I simply took the ordinary bazaar rice and cooked it through till it became one mass.
('66', 227, 5, 22, 404725) The reader will be glad to know that the quarrel ended in a victory for the reform, and the wife became a convert to properly cooked rice.
('66', 227, 5, 23, 404864) The precaution about unpolished rice is all the
('66', 227, 6, 24, 404912) 1 The quotation is not reproduced here.
('66', 227, 6, 25, 404952) Banker had asserted that contrary to the opinion of some, unpolished.
('66', 227, 6, 26, 405022) rice was not difficult to digest and suggested that Gandhiji might elicit authentic information on the point.
('66', 228, 0, 1, 405132) VOL.66: 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 229
('66', 228, 1, 2, 405177) more necessary, because the pericarp of rice, which contains all its richer constituents, requires to be cooked thoroughly.
('66', 228, 1, 3, 405301) Therefore, if un polished rice is soaked in cold water for at least three hours before cooking, and then well boiled, there is not only no danger of its proving indigestible, but it will be decidedly more palatable, as has already been found at Maganwadi, the abode of the Association in Wardha.
('66', 228, 1, 4, 405597) We have been having here what may be called half polished rice, not the perfect variety that is described in the foregoing letter.
('66', 228, 1, 5, 405728) Ne vertheless, the rice is well cooked.
('66', 228, 1, 6, 405768) Nobody has complained about its indigestibility.
('66', 228, 1, 7, 405817) But, being far more nutritious than polished rice, which is about pure starch, naturally unpolished rice cannot be, and must not be, eaten in the same quantity as polished rice.
('66', 228, 1, 8, 405995) This is true of all conservative cookery.

('66', 228, 3, 10, 406056) 333. MEANING OF ‘STATUS’
('66', 228, 4, 11, 406081) A very valued Harijan sevak puts the following question arising out of the working of the recently passed 1 new constitution.
('66', 228, 5, 12, 406207) The term ‘status’ in the pledges A and B. If by this term is meant that in the eye of God there is no superior or inferior human being, as in the eye of law there is none, our members are prepared to subscribe to it.
('66', 228, 5, 13, 406424) That is to say, they accept it as a religious or philosophical doctrine, the status referred to being spiritual.
('66', 228, 5, 14, 406537) But if by it is meant that no difference in worldly status should be recognized as between master and servant, teacher and pupil, husband and wife, judge and prisoner and so on, it is difficult for us to sign the pledge.
('66', 228, 5, 15, 406758) Kindly let me know if it is spiritual and not wordly status that is meant here.
('66', 228, 5, 16, 406838) Here is the portion of the pledge referred to.
('66', 228, 6, 17, 406885) I do not consider any human being as inferior to me in status and I should strive my utmost to live up to that belief.
('66', 228, 6, 18, 407004) I should think that the answer is given in the pledge itself.
('66', 228, 6, 19, 407066) Evidently, however, equality has been confused by the writer with obliteration of differences.
('66', 228, 6, 20, 407161) If there were no differences or no varieties, there would be no phenomenal world, and the question of equality, i.e., inferiority and superiority, would not arise at all.
('66', 228, 6, 21, 407332) But when God became many, differentiation became a necessity of the case, it would be surely rebellion against the Maker for any of the component parts
('66', 228, 7, 22, 407484) 1 The constitution of the Harijan Sevak Sangh was adopted on January 2, 1935.
('66', 229, 0, 1, 407562) 230 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 229, 1, 2, 407604) to claim superiority over others.
('66', 229, 1, 3, 407638) They must be all equal in status, though different in stature, colour, form, qualities, etc.
('66', 229, 1, 4, 407731) Husband and wife, pupil and teacher, master and servant, judge and criminal, jailor and prisoner are undoubtedly different, but woe betide the husband who considers himself as superior to his wife, or the master as superior to his servant, of the judge as superior to the condemned criminal.
('66', 229, 1, 5, 408023) All the misery in the world is born of the belief in inequality.
('66', 229, 1, 6, 408088) Untouchability as Hindus practise it is its extreme form.
('66', 229, 1, 7, 408146) And what can be more appropriate than that a Harijan sevak should, whilst purging himself of the ancestral taint, think inwardly and get rid altogether of the poison of inequality?
('66', 229, 1, 8, 408327) But what is to be the mark of a master who considers his servant to be his inferior and of the one who considers him to be his equal?
('66', 229, 1, 9, 408461) Well, the one has no consideration for his servant, for he has no interest in him save that he wants service from him against the pay he receives.
('66', 229, 1, 10, 408608) The other treats him as a member of his family.
('66', 229, 1, 11, 408656) Old servants in godfearing families take the place of parents to their masters’ children.
('66', 229, 1, 12, 408746) The masters are sharers in their servants’ misfortunes and trials.
('66', 229, 1, 13, 408813) The servants do not feel that they are any different from their masters, whom they will even upbraid if they go wrong.
('66', 229, 1, 14, 408932) The difference between the superior master and the humble master is the difference between chalk and cheese.
('66', 229, 1, 15, 409041) It is a difference in kind, not merely in degree.
('66', 229, 1, 16, 409091) We are all far from the attainment of this equality, though it is natural and becoming to us as human beings endowed with reason and heart.
('66', 229, 1, 17, 409231) But it is our duty, as also privilege, to strive to enforce that belief in daily life and not merely hope to live it in the world hereafter.
('66', 229, 1, 18, 409372) If we do not make an honest effort, what can be the meaning of equality in the eye of the law?
('66', 229, 1, 19, 409467) This friend, who is a conscientious honorary and honoured worker in the cause, has also difficulty in understanding the implications of the expression ‘whole time workers’ occurring in Rule 10 of the constitution, which provides for one third of Provincial Boards being whole time workers.
('66', 229, 1, 20, 409757) His difficulty is real, because there is nothing to suggest in the rule that they should or may be paid workers.
('66', 229, 1, 21, 409870) As I was present when the constitution was being patiently hammered into shape, I can easily fill in the gap which was purposely left there.
('66', 229, 1, 22, 410011) A permanent paid service by whole time workers is in contemplation.
('66', 229, 1, 23, 410079) It is already in the process of formation.
('66', 229, 1, 24, 410122) It will not exclude honorary whole time workers who have means enough to enable them to give their whole time to the work.
('66', 229, 1, 25, 410245) The word ‘paid’ seemed also to be offensive in this connection.
('66', 229, 1, 26, 410309) Hence it was dropped.
('66', 230, 0, 1, 410331) VOL.66: 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 231
('66', 230, 1, 2, 410376) But it is clearly contemplated that one third of the workers should be drawn from paid whole time workers wherever they might be available, always assuming that they possess other qualifications for the responsible office.
('66', 230, 1, 3, 410599) The friend has a third difficulty which he states as follows:
('66', 230, 2, 4, 410661) The members of our Board, and especially the Harijan members, desire that Rule 24 should be modified by inserting a minimum proportion of one third in the place of “as many Harijan members as it is possible to secure”.
('66', 230, 2, 5, 410880) In a place like Madras, it is e asily possible to secure 15 Harijanmembers, and as the rule now stands, it would not be permissible to put any others on the Board.
('66', 230, 2, 6, 411044) That would defeat the very object of the Sangh, which is the service of Harijans by non Harijan Hindus.
('66', 230, 2, 7, 411148) The difficulty arises, perhaps, from his overlooking the clause consistently with its maximum”.
('66', 230, 2, 8, 411244) Let me give the whole sentence in the rule.
('66', 230, 2, 9, 411288) “Every Board or Committee shall have as many Harijan members as it is possible to secure consistently with its maximum.” The qualifying clause was intentionally put to avoid the interpretation sought to be placed upon the rule.
('66', 230, 2, 10, 411516) The suggested alteration was con sidered by the Board at Delhi.
('66', 230, 2, 11, 411580) But many members had ex perienced difficulties in securing suitable Harijans to make one third of the membership of their Boards.
('66', 230, 2, 12, 411710) The existing rule meets both the diffi culties.
('66', 230, 2, 13, 411758) I must, however, reiterate my own faith here.
('66', 230, 2, 14, 411804) I was opposed, as I am even now, to the inclusion of Harijans in Harijan Sevak Boards.
('66', 230, 2, 15, 411891) If the Harijan Sevak Sangh is a society of penitent debtors, as it has been conceived to be, it can contain no creditors.
('66', 230, 2, 16, 412013) Creditors are there.
('66', 230, 2, 17, 412034) They will some day or other dictate their terms.
('66', 230, 2, 18, 412083) Today the vast majority are helpless.
('66', 230, 2, 19, 412121) Some even believe that they would commit a heinous sin if they regarded themselves as anything but the meanest and tabooed creation of God.
('66', 230, 2, 20, 412261) The penitent caste Hindu has to render service in all humility.
('66', 230, 2, 21, 412325) It may or may not be accepted.
('66', 230, 2, 22, 412356) His repentance may be too late.
('66', 230, 2, 23, 412388) But whether late or in time, he must perform it.
('66', 230, 2, 24, 412437) He can’t have Harijans to do for him.
('66', 230, 2, 25, 412475) No wonder, with the possible interpretation put upon the rule, the Harijan friends were frightened to shoulder the burden.
('66', 230, 2, 26, 412598) Were they to do penance themselves or to impose it on caste Hindus, who would not be on the Board at all?
('66', 230, 2, 27, 412704) But the tangible difficulty of members from the different provinces who wanted some Harijans on their Boards overbore my opposition.
('66', 230, 2, 28, 412837) My ideal had to recede before their hard experience.
('66', 231, 0, 1, 412890) 232 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 231, 1, 2, 412932) proper, unstrained interpretation of the rule, therefore, is that the Harijan Sevak Boards are to contain as many Harijans as possible, but always containing a preponderating majority of caste Hindus who shall not be less than two thirds of the whole Board.
('66', 231, 1, 3, 413190) But they are not bound to have even one third Harijans if duly qualified persons cannot be secured.
('66', 231, 1, 4, 413290) The pledge to be signed by them has been purposely made extremely light and simple.
('66', 231, 1, 5, 413374) There should, therefore, be no difficulty in securing one third Harijan members.
('66', 231, 1, 6, 413455) The rule being there, it must be honestly worked.

('66', 233, 1, 4, 415841) And before you entitle yourself to do soyou will have to follow the prescription, “Physician heal thyself”.
('66', 233, 1, 5, 415949) I hope you will not desert the Board or the Committee.
('66', 233, 1, 6, 416004) You need not take any great active part requiring much strain.

('66', 233, 7, 21, 416480) He should seek the assistance of places nearest his abode.

('66', 233, 7, 24, 416620) You will examine him, make his acquaintance, find out his credentials, and do whatever is needed.

('66', 235, 14, 20, 419013) Your letter of 5th instant is still before me.
('66', 235, 14, 21, 419060) A parcel of envelopes was sent to you the other day.
('66', 235, 14, 22, 419113) The writers’ cramp is still there.
('66', 235, 14, 23, 419148) I wrote today for Harijan and a few brief letters.
('66', 235, 14, 24, 419199) But that was about all I could do for the day with the right hand.
('66', 235, 14, 25, 419266) I know that your entry and that of women like you into the village movement will make it artistic and attractive.

('66', 236, 1, 4, 419950) But I see you have a special gift for writing work.
('66', 236, 1, 5, 420002) Your organization perhaps can’t do without the quantity of work you are giving it.

('66', 236, 1, 10, 420500) I was therefore distressed to find that child marriages were as common among them as among some caste Hindus.
('66', 236, 1, 11, 420610) It is a cruel custom having nothing of good in it.
('66', 236, 1, 12, 420661) They should also know that it has been declared illegal by special legislation.
('66', 236, 1, 13, 420741) I hope therefore that Harijans will make a great effort to rid themselves of this evil custom.” 1

('66', 236, 2, 20, 421028) They were all thrown up in the air.
('66', 236, 2, 21, 421064) It was a miraculous escape.

('66', 238, 7, 9, 423496) NARAHARI,
('66', 238, 8, 10, 423506) I have been the defaulter.
('66', 238, 8, 11, 423533) Every day I think of writing to you but have to postpone it.
('66', 238, 8, 12, 423594) Today I have set aside other letters and have taken up yours.
('66', 238, 8, 13, 423656) My right hand is out of form.
('66', 238, 8, 14, 423686) That also is a handicap.
('66', 238, 8, 15, 423711) What is one to do when life is so short and the things to do so many?
('66', 238, 8, 16, 423781) Now I have again become a cook.
('66', 238, 8, 17, 423813) 1. Take it that I have a right to appoint a Gram Seva Samiti and I appoint Jugatram a member as well as trustee of the Fund in place of Kakasaheb.
('66', 238, 8, 18, 423960) 2. If Sardar also desires it, then let the Gram Seva Samiti and Jain Sahitya Prachar Samiti form a part of Vidyapith.
('66', 238, 8, 19, 424078) I assume that Kakasaheb has no suggestions to make in this matter.
('66', 238, 8, 20, 424145) I write this because I often forget what happened in the past.
('66', 238, 8, 21, 424208) 3. I would definitely like it if the children of Ras and other places who are scattered over different places are brought to one placeand a school is started for them.
('66', 238, 8, 22, 424376) I shall concur if you all and Sardar do that.
('66', 238, 8, 23, 424422) 4.The question of girls’ education is worth considering.
('66', 238, 8, 24, 424479) Savarna Hindus should not dominate in a Harijan Ashram.
('66', 238, 8, 25, 424535) Its buildings should never be used in a way which would put us to shame later.
('66', 238, 8, 26, 424614) And who would look after that work?
('66', 238, 8, 27, 424650) Do not involve yourself in any other activity.
('66', 238, 8, 28, 424697) The person who went to Godhra Ashram found the work dull there.
('66', 238, 8, 29, 424761) Bear in mind that so far that work has been most despised.
('66', 238, 8, 30, 424820) I am, therefore, doubtful about starting something exclusively for girls.
('66', 238, 8, 31, 424894) Raojibhai has started something.
('66', 238, 8, 32, 424927) What about that?

('66', 240, 10, 13, 426940) DEAR SIR,
('66', 240, 11, 14, 426950) Dhirendra Chandra Mukerji is a detenu in the Deoli Camp.
('66', 240, 11, 15, 427007) He has been as son to Shrimati Urmiladevi, of 335 Jitendas Road, Calcutta, widowed sister of the late Deshbandhu C. R. Das.
('66', 240, 11, 16, 427131) I know the lady well.
('66', 240, 11, 17, 427153) She has motherly affection for my companion Sjt.
('66', 240, 11, 18, 427202) Mahadev Desai.
('66', 240, 11, 19, 427217) The latter had recently gone to Gosaba and was therefore able to pass a day with Shrimati Urmiladevi.
('66', 240, 11, 20, 427319) She is most anxious about Sjt.
('66', 240, 11, 21, 427350) Dhirendra Chandra Mukerji.
('66', 240, 11, 22, 427377) She has not seen him for three years and not heard from him since June last.
('66', 240, 11, 23, 427454) She is unable to see him, but would be delighted if Sjt.
('66', 240, 11, 24, 427511) Mahadev Desai could be permitted to see one whom she calls her son.
('66', 240, 11, 25, 427579) I may state that both Sjt.
('66', 240, 11, 26, 427606) Mahadev Desai and I know Sjt.
('66', 240, 11, 27, 427636) Dhirendra Chandra Mukerji, who was with me for some time at the late Sabarmati Ashram, and would very probably have joined it had he not been arrested.
('66', 240, 11, 28, 427788) I shall be obliged if you would kindly let me know if Sjt.
('66', 240, 11, 29, 427847) Mahadev Desai could have permission to visit Sjt.

('66', 241, 6, 8, 428186) DEAR ZAKIR,
('66', 241, 7, 9, 428198) It is a great idea to have the foundation of the Jamia 2 laid by its youngest child.
('66', 241, 7, 10, 428283) My congratulations on the originality of the conception.
('66', 241, 7, 11, 428340) I know that the Jamia has a great future.
('66', 241, 7, 12, 428382) Through it I expect the seed of Hindu Muslim union to grow into a majestic tree.
('66', 241, 7, 13, 428463) I therefore wish every success to the enterprise.
('66', 241, 7, 14, 428513) I hope that the appeal for funds made by Dr. Ansari will meet with the success it deserves.
('66', 241, 7, 15, 428605) You have every right to expect me to do whatever is in my power.
('66', 241, 7, 16, 428670) Jamnalalji is coming today.
('66', 241, 7, 17, 428698) I shall share your letter with him.

('66', 241, 10, 21, 428795) 1 The Government of Bengal were against the request being granted as neither Mahadev Desai nor Urmiladevi was a relative of the detenu.
('66', 241, 10, 22, 428931) They feared also that the detenu was “a dangerous terrorist” and the interview might be used for political purposes.
('66', 241, 10, 23, 429048) However, on advice from the Government of India the interview was allowed.

('66', 242, 3, 4, 429246) RAMDAS,
('66', 242, 4, 5, 429254) I received your letter.
('66', 242, 4, 6, 429278) I get time for writing letters only before the morning prayer.
('66', 242, 4, 7, 429341) I therefore reply to you before the prayer.
('66', 242, 4, 8, 429385) Jamnalalji will of course see you today.
('66', 242, 4, 9, 429426) I cannot say that I like the printing press work you have taken up.
('66', 242, 4, 10, 429494) I would have liked your tailor’s job more.
('66', 242, 4, 11, 429537) But what pleasure can I take in what 1 like?
('66', 242, 4, 12, 429582) My pleasure lies in what you like and can do.
('66', 242, 4, 13, 429628) You like the work you have taken up and so does Jamnalalji.
('66', 242, 4, 14, 429688) Swami has liked it, too.
('66', 242, 4, 15, 429713) I am therefore content.
('66', 242, 4, 16, 429737) You would not have made money quickly as a tailor, but may do so from the printing press.
('66', 242, 4, 17, 429827) Patil is a good man and is intelligent.
('66', 242, 4, 18, 429867) It is therefore likely that he will acquit himself well.
('66', 242, 4, 19, 429924) Your need just now is not only to keep your mind occupied but also to earn enough money.
('66', 242, 4, 20, 430013) By all means take up the work and make a success of it.
('66', 242, 4, 21, 430069) It cannot but give me pleasure if your health is restored, you stand on your own feet, and acquire self confidence.
('66', 242, 4, 22, 430185) There is nothing demeaning in the printing press work.
('66', 242, 4, 23, 430240) Take care of your health.
('66', 242, 4, 24, 430266) Harilal is arriving today.
('66', 242, 4, 25, 430293) I thought it best to keep him under my care for the present.
('66', 242, 4, 26, 430354) Quite a few are not convinced that he has reformed himself.
('66', 242, 4, 27, 430414) He has been reassuring me and I felt that I should keep him with me.
('66', 242, 4, 28, 430483) My daily life is gradually returning to its former manner.
('66', 242, 4, 29, 430542) I do not at all like to leave this place.
('66', 242, 4, 30, 430584) I have taken over charge of the kitchen from today.
('66', 242, 4, 31, 430636) All work is done by hand.
('66', 242, 4, 32, 430662) Ba is helping me more than I had expected.
('66', 242, 4, 33, 430705) She makes there rotlis for one meal every day, keeps all the grains clean and washes the utensils.
('66', 242, 4, 34, 430804) She does not lack enthusiasm, does nothing unwillingly.
('66', 242, 4, 35, 430860) Thus things are going on all right just now.

('66', 244, 4, 7, 432397) You did not come even after my wire.

('66', 244, 4, 9, 432474) Under the changed circumstances your letter does not need a reply.

('66', 245, 3, 4, 433672) NARANDAS,
('66', 245, 4, 5, 433682) Kale himself has brought the machine.
('66', 245, 4, 6, 433720) It is being worked in front of me.
('66', 245, 4, 7, 433755) It seems all right.
('66', 245, 4, 8, 433775) It is not good enough for a prize, but can be very useful.
('66', 245, 4, 9, 433834) The owner is arriving today.
('66', 245, 4, 10, 433863) I wish to have a long talk with him.
('66', 245, 4, 11, 433900) One length of cloth has already been woven from its yarn.
('66', 245, 4, 12, 433958) A second one is about to be ready.
('66', 245, 4, 13, 433993) It can spin 16,000 yards in eight hours.
('66', 245, 4, 14, 434034) The yarn is of 20 count.
('66', 245, 4, 15, 434059) If paddy is ground in an ordinary quern, the husk is separa ted.
('66', 245, 4, 16, 434124) A large quantity can thus be husked with little labour.
('66', 245, 4, 17, 434180) This may be said to be my discovery.
('66', 245, 4, 18, 434217) The quern can be made as light as desired by fixing a washer to the axle.
('66', 245, 4, 19, 434291) This saves a lot of time.
('66', 245, 4, 20, 434317) The work has been rendered very easy.
('66', 245, 4, 21, 434355) The rice obtained thus is always cheaper than mill rice.
('66', 245, 4, 22, 434412) It tastes verysweet and one gets more satisfaction from a smaller quantity.
('66', 245, 4, 23, 434488) Paddy is easier to preserve and one can, if one wishes, eat freshly husked rice every day.
('66', 245, 4, 24, 434579) Kanu tells me that respected Khushalbhai’s collection contains other translations of the Gita, too.

('66', 245, 4, 26, 434727) I required the verse translation to compare it with Kishorelal’s verse translation.
('66', 245, 4, 27, 434811) It has nothing of special interest in regard to the meaning or anything else.

('66', 246, 1, 2, 435250) 359. MEMBERSHIP OF ALL INDIA VILLAGE INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION
('66', 246, 2, 3, 435310) From the abstract of the proceedings, to be found elsewhere 1, of the last meeting of the All India Village Industries Association (Headquarters: Wardha, C. P.), readers will find out how one can become a Member or Associate of the Sangh.
('66', 246, 2, 4, 435549) It is to be hoped that those who can fulfil the conditions of Membership or Associateship, will send in the forms duly filled in to the Secretary, Wardha.
('66', 246, 2, 5, 435704) It will be wrong to wait for invitations.
('66', 246, 2, 6, 435746) People await invitations when it is a matter of getting power or prestige.
('66', 246, 2, 7, 435821) They do not, when it is a matter of seeking the privilege of service.
('66', 246, 2, 8, 435891) Let the intending members realize that, unless they are registered as such before 31st March next, they lose in certain eventualities the opportunity of appointment as trustees.
('66', 246, 2, 9, 436069) In the event of a trusteeship becoming vacant before the expiry of five years of the existence of the Association, the remaining trustees should have as long a range of choice as possible.
('66', 246, 2, 10, 436258) This is not possible if many members are not registered before 31st March.
('66', 246, 2, 11, 436333) Without a wide range of choice, the progress of the movement towards its ideal would suffer a check.
('66', 246, 2, 12, 436434) For, the trustees are not merely custodians of the funds, but they are also custodians of the ideal for which the Association stands.
('66', 246, 2, 13, 436568) But even they, however capable they may be of representing the ideal, will be a shaky foundation unless they have the knowledge that they have the support of a large number of men and women from whom they can draw inspiration and strength and on whom they can rely when they have to choose a successor or successors.
('66', 246, 2, 14, 436885) Trusteeship of the Association has been made a position of heavy responsibility by the trustees being made finally responsible for the protection of the ideal, in the remote but not altogether impossible event of its being lowered in the process of democratization of the Association.
('66', 246, 2, 15, 437170) And yet democratization is as necessary for the growth of the movement as the permanence of the ideal, which must not be put in the melting pot.
('66', 246, 2, 16, 437315) But the working out of the ideal is so put.
('66', 246, 2, 17, 437359) For, it is made to rest solely in the hands of a Board which seven years hence becomes subject to election by voters whose sole qualification is

('66', 247, 0, 1, 437633) 248 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 247, 1, 2, 437675) subscribing to the creed of the Association.
('66', 247, 1, 3, 437720) It is true that the application for membership is subject to rejection by the Board.
('66', 247, 1, 4, 437805) That is a precaution merely to prevent an unbeliever becoming a member only to shatter the ideal to pieces.
('66', 247, 1, 5, 437913) The franchise is more extensive than even adult franchise.
('66', 247, 1, 6, 437972) Every villager who is conscious of the dignity of village life and its infinite capacity for promoting the happiness of mankind can belong to the Association.
('66', 247, 1, 7, 438131) Let those, therefore, who believe in the policy and the ideal of the Association become members and work for the economic, moral and physical welfare of the villagers of India, irrespective of differences in political faith, religion, caste or race.
('66', 247, 1, 8, 438381) The Association recognizes no caste, religious, political or racial differences.

('66', 247, 3, 11, 438500) BUFFALO’S
('66', 247, 4, 12, 438510) The question whether cow’s milk is superior to buffalo’s has come up for inquiry in considering that of village reconstruction.
('66', 247, 4, 13, 438638) I have addressed friends on the subject.
('66', 247, 4, 14, 438679) Shri Haribhau Phatak has forwarded to me a letter received by him from Prof.
('66', 247, 4, 15, 438756) Rao Bahadur Sahasrabuddhe, which reads as follows: 1
('66', 247, 5, 16, 438809) With regard to your enquiry about the differences between cow milk and buffalo milk, I have to say that the fat and casein of cow milk are more easily digestible than those of buffalo millk.
('66', 247, 6, 17, 439000) The cow milk has also greater amount of vitamins than buffalo milk.
('66', 247, 6, 18, 439068) These qualities affect children and adults equally, but an adult can digest buffalo milk while a child cannot.
('66', 247, 6, 19, 439179) I think this is all that you want.
('66', 247, 6, 20, 439214) He has also received an opinion from Dr. S. K. Apte of Sholapur, Vice President, Gopalak Sangh, which is reproducedbelow, 2
('66', 247, 7, 21, 439338) the names of those who sent replies to his questionnaire and some of the replies themselves being omitted.
('66', 247, 8, 22, 439445) The question whether cow milk is superior to buffalo milk is being discussed during the last three years, and this has had a good effect in attracting the public attention to the utility of cow milk.
('66', 247, 8, 23, 439645) The burden of proving that it is superior lies on those who assert so.
('66', 247, 8, 24, 439716) There are several ways of proving this scientifically.
('66', 247, 8, 25, 439771) They can be enumerated as follows:
('66', 247, 9, 26, 439806) 1 Only extracts are reproduced here.

('66', 248, 0, 1, 439880) VOL.66: 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 249
('66', 248, 1, 2, 439925) 1. To compare the merits and demerits of both milks by analysis of their components.
('66', 248, 1, 3, 440010) It is possible chemically to ascertain the nutritive value of their components.
('66', 248, 1, 4, 440090) Such an experiment has been made by Prof.
('66', 248, 1, 5, 440132) Rao Bahadur D. L. Sahasrabuddhe of the Agricultural College, Poona, the details of which he has published in the Dhyanprakash dated 11 9 1934. He has made it clear therein not only that cow milk is very useful for the nutrition of young children but that buffalo milk is actually harmful to them.
('66', 248, 2, 6, 440429) 2. To make two equal groups of boys or men live under the same conditions and to provide one batch with about a seer of cow milk and the other with an equal amount of buffalo milk for a certain period and to watch and record the physical, mental and intellectual development of each member of both the groups.
('66', 248, 2, 7, 440739) The Gopalak Sangh of Sholapur had written to the Hoard s Dairy man for information as to which countries except India use buffaloes as dairy animals.
('66', 248, 2, 8, 440889) The reply to this query shows that buffalo milk is used outside India only in the Philippine Islands and the southern part of China.
('66', 248, 2, 9, 441022) An experiment of the above nature is, therefore, not likely to be made anywhere outside India.
('66', 248, 2, 10, 441117) This experiment will have to be made on some students residing in a boarding house.
('66', 248, 3, 11, 441201) 3. This comparative experiment on human beings is a matter of great expense.
('66', 248, 3, 12, 441278) It is possible to try this experiment on animals, especially rats and guinea pigs kept in experimental laboratories.
('66', 248, 3, 13, 441395) As the Gopolak Sangh has no material available for this sort of experiment, it has written to the Government Pasteur Institute at Coonoor to try such an experiment; but no reply has yet been received from the authorities there.
('66', 248, 4, 14, 441623) 4. The Gopalak Sangh, Sholapur, took recourse to a fourth, and the easiest, way towards this end.
('66', 248, 4, 15, 441721) A questionnaire regarding cow and buffalo milks was prepared and sent some six months back to various doctors, physicians, research experts, newspapers and periodicals, and Government officers in Medical and Health Departments in and outside India.
('66', 248, 4, 16, 441970) About seven hundred copies in Marathi and English of this questionnaire were then sent out.
('66', 248, 4, 17, 442062) About fifty replies have been received so far.
('66', 248, 5, 18, 442109) The following are the conclusions deducible from the replies:
('66', 248, 6, 19, 442171) 1. Buffalo milk is injurious to the development of children, and only cow milk is, in the absence of mother’s milk, useful to them.
('66', 248, 7, 20, 442303) 2. Cow milk, being easily digestible, is more beneficial to patients than buffalo milk.
('66', 248, 8, 21, 442391) 3. There is no definite evidence to show that the use of buffalo milk by adults is in any way injurious.
('66', 248, 8, 22, 442496) Mr. Bruen, the livestock expert to the Government of Bombay, says that buffalo milk is hard to digest for a person of any age, because the excess fat in buffalo milk when it forms soap in the intestine, is hard to digest with the usual amount of salts, and it takes the
('66', 249, 0, 1, 442766) 250 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 249, 1, 2, 442808) deficient quantity of the mineral salts from bones, which are consequently weakened.
('66', 249, 1, 3, 442893) This does not occur in the digestion of cow milk.
('66', 249, 2, 4, 442943) 4. Cow milk is useful for intellectual growth, mainly of children.
('66', 249, 2, 5, 443010) No definite conclusion can be drawn regarding better effect of cow milk on the intellectual growth of adults.
('66', 249, 2, 6, 443120) 5. If, instead of rearing up buffaloes, cows are kept in the city, it will produce a beneficial effect on the general hygiene of that city, with less expense.
('66', 249, 2, 7, 443279) The experiment that Dr. Apte has suggested is worth making.
('66', 249, 2, 8, 443339) The question of the comparative merits of the cow and the buffalo is of national importance from many points of view.
('66', 249, 2, 9, 443457) In no other country in the world do these animals play the part that they do in the life of the nation in India.
('66', 249, 2, 10, 443570) Even without further experiment, the opinions collected by Dr. Apte of eminent medical men and dairy experts sufficiently prove the superiority of cow’s milk over buffalo’s.

('66', 249, 8, 20, 444219) Take either fenugreek leaves, spinach, white goosefoot or purslane.
('66', 249, 8, 21, 444287) Along with radish its leaves can also be taken, also those of carrots.
('66', 249, 8, 22, 444358) Radish might perhaps aggravate constipation.
('66', 249, 8, 23, 444403) It is believed that leaves are very good as laxative.

('66', 250, 5, 7, 444945) [February 22, 1935] 2
('66', 250, 6, 8, 444967) I have been a cook all my life.
('66', 250, 6, 9, 444999) I began experimenting with my diet in my student days in London.
('66', 250, 6, 10, 445064) I ran the kitchen throughout my stay in South Africa, and some of you know how much I had to do with the kitchen in Sabarmati.
('66', 250, 6, 11, 445191) Now we have embarked on a mission the like of which we had not undertaken before.
('66', 250, 6, 12, 445273) We have got to be ideal villagers, not the villagers with their queer ideas, or absence of ideas, about sanitation and giving no thought to how they eat and what they eat.
('66', 250, 6, 13, 445445) Let us not, like most of them, cook anyhow, eat anyhow, liveanyhow.
('66', 250, 6, 14, 445513) Let us show them the ideal diet.
('66', 250, 6, 15, 445546) Let us not go by mere likes and dislikes, but get at the root of those likes and dislikes.
('66', 250, 6, 16, 445637) Don’t rest content with simply saying, ‘ The food disagrees with me.’ Find out the reason why it disagrees.
('66', 250, 6, 17, 445745) Whether you like a thing or not will depend on the ideal of village life that you have kept before yourselves.
('66', 250, 6, 18, 445856) The bulk of the villagers, we know live on wheat, jowari, bajri, or rice and dal, but they don’t have green leaves and other vegetables.
('66', 250, 6, 19, 445993) We have got to show them that they can grow their vegetables, their greens, without much expense, and keep good health.
('66', 250, 6, 20, 446113) We have also to show them that most of the vitamins are lost when they cook the leaves.
('66', 250, 6, 21, 446201) These are not my fads.
('66', 250, 6, 22, 446224) I am simply trying to put into effect what all the doctors are saying and prescribing, and I am asking you to do what hundreds have done to their great benefit.
('66', 250, 7, 23, 446385) 1 Extracted from Mahadev Desai’s “Weekly Notes”.
('66', 250, 7, 24, 446434) The meeting was held to discuss the changes introduced in the Ashram food by which spices were completely discarded and cooked vegetables were replaced by vegetable salad at least once a day, and to consider various suggestions.
('66', 250, 7, 25, 446663) 2 According to Mahadev Desai the meeting was held on the eve of Gandhiji’s departure for Nagpur.
('66', 250, 7, 26, 446760) He was in Nagpur on February 23.

('66', 251, 1, 2, 446835) Therefore, if you agree with my reasoning that the villagers ought to eat the green stuffs raw, that they must cook their rice just husked and not pounded or polished, you must set them the example.
('66', 251, 1, 3, 447034) But also remember that we have to show them an inexpensive way of getting all the best part of our food products and of thus gaining in health.
('66', 251, 1, 4, 447178) We have to teach them how to economize in time, health and money.
('66', 251, 1, 5, 447244) If I could carry you all with me, I could make even the present menu simpler.
('66', 251, 1, 6, 447322) But I want your hearty and intelligent consent and I want you to feel that, in doing what we are doing, we are discharging a sacred trust.
('66', 251, 1, 7, 447461) We want agents to carry on the work of the Village Industries Association.
('66', 251, 1, 8, 447536) Well, in that case, we must start with becoming agents for our own surroundings.
('66', 251, 1, 9, 447617) Lionel Curtis described our villages as dung heaps.
('66', 251, 1, 10, 447669) We have to turn them into model villages.
('66', 251, 1, 11, 447711) Our village folk do not get fresh air, though they are surrounded by fresh air; they don’t get fresh food, though they arc surrounded by the freshest foods.
('66', 251, 1, 12, 447868) I am talking like a missionary in this matter of food, because my mission is to make villages a thing of beauty.
('66', 251, 1, 13, 447981) Let all that we do be in consonance with our mission.
('66', 251, 1, 14, 448035) Even jokes have a meaning hidden in them, and when Jamnalalji twitted Mirabehn with the remark that she was reconnoitring the villages driving in a motor car, he certainly pointed our attention to glaring inconsistencies in our lives.
('66', 251, 1, 15, 448270) People pardon inconsistencies in their own lives, but remember that they will not pardon them in us, their servants.

('66', 251, 4, 18, 448449) February 23, 1935
('66', 251, 5, 19, 448467) In declaring the third Khadi Bhandar in Nagpur open, Mahatmaji hoped that the public would support the new Bhandar as they had done in the case of the two Bhandars already opened.
('66', 251, 5, 20, 448647) He said: Do not suppose that I will be elated with the opening of this Bhandar or that my hopes will be fulfilled with this.
('66', 251, 5, 21, 448772) My expectations will be fulfilled only when everyone in Nagpur is clad in khadi and when no piece of cloth other than khadi is found in every house in Nagpur.
('66', 251, 6, 22, 448931) Proceeding Gandhiji said that khadi was the mainstay of the rural population and it was the duty of everyone to stand by them.
('66', 251, 6, 23, 449058) The only way to help the rural population was to wear khadi so extensively that Khadi Bhandars would be opened in

('66', 252, 1, 2, 449219) every locality of Nagpur.
('66', 252, 1, 3, 449245) He hoped that the day when Khadi Bhandars would be opened in every locality of Nagpur would not be far off.
('66', 252, 1, 4, 449353) Concluding, he appealed to the audience not to leave the place after his departure but to purchase khadi from the newly opened Bhandar.

('66', 252, 5, 8, 449585) Mahatma Gandhi, in declaring the newly erected building of the Bhandar open, said that as it was his first visit to Nagpur after the death of Mr. Abhyankar, he thought it his duty to say a few words about him.
('66', 252, 5, 9, 449795) It was no exaggeration that in Mr. Abhyankar Gandhiji himself had lost a near relative.
('66', 252, 5, 10, 449883) It was on the fitness of things that the Nagpur Congress Committee had decided to raise a suitable memorial to him and he hoped that everyone would contribute his mite towards the memorial fund.
('66', 252, 6, 11, 450078) He also appealed to the Memorial Committee to complete the work under taken by them as quickly as possible.
('66', 252, 6, 12, 450186) He thanked the Nagpur Municipality for allotting a piece of land on nominal rent and expressed the desire that not only its members but even its servants would become khaddar clad.
('66', 252, 6, 13, 450367) He reminded theaudience that the Khadi Bhandar in Sitabuldi sold khadi produced in Maharashtra which was held in high esteem both for its price, durability and fineness.

('66', 252, 10, 17, 450629) I am afraid I must repeat the gospel to you and remind you that, when you demand swaraj, you do not want swaraj for yourself alone, but for your neighbour, too.
('66', 252, 10, 18, 450790) The principle is neither metaphysical nor too philosophical for comprehension.
('66', 252, 10, 19, 450869) It is just good common sense.
('66', 252, 10, 20, 450899) If you love thy neighbour as thyself, he will do likewise with you.
('66', 252, 10, 21, 450967) What you say about the difficulties of a worker in the villages is too true, 2 but we have got to falsify it.

('66', 252, 11, 24, 451155) The meeting was held at the residence of Ganpatrao Tikekar.
('66', 252, 11, 25, 451215) 2 A worker had said that he had found it very difficult to live like a villager in a village and make both ends meet.

('66', 253, 1, 2, 451375) without their shortcomings and failings, and I am quite sure that, when we do so, there would be no difficulty for an honest labourer to earn a living wage.
('66', 253, 1, 3, 451532) But let no one come and tell me: ‘I have a mother, three widowed sisters, a brother who has to be sent to England to be called to the Bar, another reading in Muir College and a third to be sent to the Indian Sandhurst.’ Sure enough, work in the villages will not give such a one a ‘ living’!
('66', 253, 1, 4, 451824) But it is possible to earn a genuine living for all the members of one’s family, if all those members also will work, as do all the members in a peasant’s family.
('66', 253, 1, 5, 451987) There is a conflict of interest between capital and labour, but we have to resolve it by doing our own duty.
('66', 253, 1, 6, 452096) Just as pure blood is proof against poisonous germs, so will labour, when it is pure, be proof against exploitation.
('66', 253, 1, 7, 452213) The labourer has but to realize that labour is also capital.
('66', 253, 1, 8, 452274) As soon as labourers are properly educated and organized and they realize their strength, no amount of capital can subdue them.
('66', 253, 1, 9, 452402) Organized and enlightened labour can dictate its own terms.
('66', 253, 1, 10, 452462) It is no use vowing vengeance against a party because we are weak.
('66', 253, 1, 11, 452529) We have to get strong.
('66', 253, 1, 12, 452552) Strong hearts, enlightened minds and willing hands can brave all odds and remove all obstacles.
('66', 253, 1, 13, 452648) No, ‘Lovethy neighbour as thyself’ is on counsel of perfection.
('66', 253, 1, 14, 452712) The capitalist is as much a neighbour of the labourer as the latter is a neighbour of the former, and one has to seek and win the willing co operation of the other.
('66', 253, 1, 15, 452877) Nor does the principle mean that we should accept exploitation lying down.
('66', 253, 1, 16, 452952) Our internal strength will render all exploitation impossible.

('66', 253, 4, 19, 453073) February 23, 1935
('66', 253, 5, 20, 453091) Gandhiji referred in feeling terms to the late Sjt.
('66', 253, 5, 21, 453143) Abhyankar and asked those in charge of the memorial to collect quickly the money necessary for a memorial worthy of the departed leader: They did not seem to be definite regarding the shape it was to take, but Gandhiji said: No memorial in these days can be a memorial in name.
('66', 253, 5, 22, 453421) It must be such as would yield ten times the result of the money expended on it, and it must be such as would satisfy not only sentiment but the need
('66', 253, 6, 23, 453571) 1 Extracted from Mahadev Desai’s “Weekly Letter”.
('66', 253, 6, 24, 453621) The meeting was held at the Chitnis Park.
('66', 253, 6, 25, 453663) Mrs. Kale presided.
('66', 254, 0, 1, 453683) VOL. 66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 255
('66', 254, 1, 2, 453730) of the city and the country.
('66', 254, 2, 3, 453759) It was during my walk in Orissa, in the course of my Harijan tour, that it was clearly brought home to me that the village industries must be revived if khadi is to be universal.
('66', 254, 2, 4, 453938) I could not have realized this in any tour by rail or car.
('66', 254, 2, 5, 453997) As the late Madhusudan Das had said, our villagers were fast being reduced to the state of the brutes with whom they worked and lived as a result of the forced idleness in which they passed their days.
('66', 254, 2, 6, 454199) If they continued in that state, not even independence would improve the state of India.
('66', 254, 2, 7, 454288) I, therefore, decided that I must, even in the evening of my life, make a heroic effort to end this idleness, this inertia.
('66', 254, 2, 8, 454412) This may be considered to be quixotic, but it is my firm faith that he who undertakes to do something in the name of God, and in full faith in Him, even at the end of his days, does not work in vain, and I am sure that the work I have undertaken is not mine, it is God’s.
('66', 254, 2, 9, 454684) The principles of economics are not, like the principles of mathematics, for instance, immutable, and for all times and climes.
('66', 254, 2, 10, 454812) England will not accept the economics of France, nor France that of Germany, nor Germany that of America, and they would be wrong if they did so.
('66', 254, 2, 11, 454958) A country which produces no food stuffs and producesonly minerals must have different economics from that which produces food stuffs but has no mineral resources.
('66', 254, 2, 12, 455121) India, therefore, cannot afford to go by the economics of France, England, America or Germany.
('66', 254, 2, 13, 455216) India was once the land of gold.
('66', 254, 2, 14, 455249) Not that it produced much gold, but it had such treasures of art, it produced cloth of such rich quality and spices of such value that other lands paid for them in treasures of gold.
('66', 254, 2, 15, 455432) We have lost that proud position today and have become mere hewers of wood and drawers of water.
('66', 254, 2, 16, 455529) But even now we can regain that proud position, for, our natural resources are unique and no other country in the world, excepting China, can boast of the crores of living machines we have.
('66', 254, 2, 17, 455719) Now, how can a country with crores of living machines afford to have a machine which will displace the labour of crores of living machines?
('66', 254, 2, 18, 455859) It would spell their unemployment and their ruin.
('66', 254, 2, 19, 455909) We have to employ all these crores of human machines that are idle, we have to make them intelligent machines, and unless cities decide to depend for the necessaries of life and for most of their other needs on the villages, this can never happen.
('66', 254, 2, 20, 456157) We are guilty of a grievous wrong against the villagers, and the only way in which we can expiate it is by
('66', 255, 0, 1, 456264) 256 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 255, 1, 2, 456306) encouraging them to revive their lost industries and arts by assuring them of a ready market.
('66', 255, 1, 3, 456400) There is no one more patient and forbearing than God, but there comes a limit even to His patience and forbearance.
('66', 255, 1, 4, 456516) If we neglect our duty to our villagers, we shall be courting our own ruin.
('66', 255, 1, 5, 456592) This duty is no onerous one.
('66', 255, 1, 6, 456621) It is incredibly simple.
('66', 255, 1, 7, 456646) We have to be rural minded and think of our necessities and the necessities of our household in the terms of rural mindedness.
('66', 255, 1, 8, 456773) The task does not involve much expenditure either.
('66', 255, 1, 9, 456824) Volunteers are needed to go to the nearest villages to assure them that all that they produce would find a ready market in the towns and cities.
('66', 255, 1, 10, 456969) This is a task which can be undertaken by men and women of all castes and creeds, of all parties and all faiths.
('66', 255, 1, 11, 457082) It is in consonance with the true economics of our country.
('66', 255, 1, 12, 457142) I have no time to expatiate on this, but I would ask you to read what is written in the columns of Harijan, English and Hindi, from week to week.

('66', 255, 4, 15, 457344) Rice from which merely its husk has been removed is known as unpolished rice, whereas, that from which a part of the grain has been rubbed off, is known as polished rice.
('66', 255, 4, 16, 457515) It seems that in Gujarat, ordinarily, the latter is consumed in greater quantities.
('66', 255, 4, 17, 457599) Medical opinion, however, states that only the former should be used, the reason being that polished rice has no nutritional value.
('66', 255, 4, 18, 457731) One doctor is of the opinion that eating polished rice is one of the causes of constipation.
('66', 255, 4, 19, 457824) In all cases of constipation he has cured his patients by prescribing unpolished rice to them.
('66', 255, 4, 20, 457919) However, rice eaters will not give up their deplorable habit of eating polished rice on account of medical opinion alone.
('66', 255, 4, 21, 458041) What they need is their own experience as well as that of others.
('66', 255, 4, 22, 458107) And this is as it should be.
('66', 255, 4, 23, 458136) A statement is meaningless to anyone whose experience contradicts it.
('66', 255, 4, 24, 458206) Hence, I am collecting the experiences of those who are making experiments.
('66', 255, 4, 25, 458282) Shri Shankerlal Banker’s experiment is the best amongst these.
('66', 255, 4, 26, 458345) I have described it in the last issue.
('66', 255, 5, 27, 458384) Shri Banker has suggested that if necessary medical opinion should be sought to prove that unpolished rice is not harmful to the

('66', 256, 1, 3, 458613) That, however, is not necessary.
('66', 256, 1, 4, 458646) All doctors claim with one voice that only unpolished rice should be eaten.
('66', 256, 1, 5, 458722) But this cannot be regarded as a statement based on experience.
('66', 256, 1, 6, 458786) They should either give their own experience or that of their patients.
('66', 256, 1, 7, 458858) There is little of such experience from them.
('66', 256, 1, 8, 458904) Hence, we should rely on the experience only of rice eaters.
('66', 256, 1, 9, 458965) Anyone undertaking the experiment should bear in mind that as unpolished rice contains all the nutritional elements, it should be properly cooked.
('66', 256, 1, 10, 459112) We should give up the habit of keeping the grains separate.
('66', 256, 1, 11, 459172) These may appear pleasing to the eye but there is no sweetness in them.
('66', 256, 1, 12, 459244) Unpolished rice is cooked in the offices of the Village Industries Association in Wardha.
('66', 256, 1, 13, 459334) Everyone eats it with relish.
('66', 256, 1, 14, 459364) But this rice cannot be eaten in the same quantity as white, shiny, polished rice.
('66', 256, 1, 15, 459447) A small quantity is enough to satisfy both the palate and the appetite.
('66', 256, 1, 16, 459519) The monetary gain is obviously twofold.
('66', 256, 1, 17, 459559) As husking is a simple operation, the cost of labour is much less.
('66', 256, 1, 18, 459626) The pounding requires more effort and skill; hence the labour charges are higher.
('66', 256, 1, 19, 459708) However, the greatest benefit lies in the maximum strength and satisfaction derived from eating unpolished rice in small quantities.
('66', 256, 1, 20, 459841) Mill rice can never equal these benefits.
('66', 256, 1, 21, 459883) No one could have a mill merely for the sake of husking rice.
('66', 256, 1, 22, 459945) One cannot afford it.
('66', 256, 1, 23, 459967) The experiments will be pure and productive of results if those making them observe the following rules: 1. Only the husk should be removed from the paddy.
('66', 256, 1, 24, 460123) It should not be pounded at all.
('66', 256, 1, 25, 460156) 2. Unpolished rice should be cleaned, little stones and other impurities should be removed from it and it should then be washed a couple of times in clean cold water.
('66', 256, 1, 26, 460323) It should not be rubbed while washing.
('66', 256, 1, 27, 460362) Rubbing is bound to remove some of the nutritious upper coating.
('66', 256, 1, 28, 460427) 3. The washed rice should be soaked in cold water for three hours.
('66', 256, 1, 29, 460494) Only a little water should be used.
('66', 256, 1, 30, 460530) 4. This soaked rice, along with the water used for soaking, should be added to boiling water and allowed to cook on a slow fire and removed only after it acquires a homogeneous consistency.
('66', 256, 1, 31, 460720) If too much water has been added, it should not be drained but allowed to be soaked up by the rice.
('66', 256, 1, 32, 460820) The next time a more proportionate quantity of water should be used.

('66', 257, 6, 7, 461109) DEAR SISTER, 1
('66', 257, 7, 8, 461124) I have your letter.
('66', 257, 7, 9, 461144) You will come whenever you wish and can.
('66', 257, 7, 10, 461185) If you can, wait until you can.
('66', 257, 7, 11, 461217) I would like to hold over my opinion on the constitution.
('66', 257, 7, 12, 461275) It will require some amendments.
('66', 257, 7, 13, 461308) I return Shoorjibhai’s letter.
('66', 257, 7, 14, 461339) I do not put the meaning upon it that you do.
('66', 257, 7, 15, 461385) It reads perfectly harmless.
('66', 257, 7, 16, 461414) It does not in any shape or form interfere with your initiative or responsibility.
('66', 257, 7, 17, 461497) Your inherent right of making mistakes is unaffected if you accept his services.
('66', 257, 7, 18, 461578) I think he is quiteright in saying that there was no question of his making a contribution.
('66', 257, 7, 19, 461670) You wanted a room or rooms in Cutch Castle.
('66', 257, 7, 20, 461714) He offered to find some other rooms.
('66', 257, 7, 21, 461751) And in addition, to give you such goods as you would care to take.
('66', 257, 7, 22, 461818) There was no question of his controlling your activities in any shape or form.
('66', 257, 7, 23, 461897) You would be either wholesale purchaser of goods that he might supply or his commission agent selling goods on his behalf or running your own shop wholly independently of him.
('66', 257, 7, 24, 462073) There is no third way of conducting the store.
('66', 257, 7, 25, 462120) That you may not wish to accept his offer and may dispense with his services is a separate thing altogether.
('66', 257, 7, 26, 462229) But it should not arise from his letter.
('66', 257, 7, 27, 462270) As a co worker in the same line and as a co member on the Managing Board, you should allow him the correctness of the attitude taken up by him in his letter.

('66', 259, 9, 13, 464267) February 24, 1935
('66', 259, 10, 14, 464285) We have no right to judge anyone a sinner as we are all full of imperfections.
('66', 259, 10, 15, 464364) We have no reason or means to judge whether those we regard as greater sinners than ourselves are truly so.
('66', 259, 10, 16, 464472) A person stealing a mere pice can be a greater sinner than a person indulging in sexual immorality.
('66', 259, 10, 17, 464572) Possibly the thief committed a deliberate theft while the licentious person put up great but unsuccessful resistance against the temptation.
('66', 259, 10, 18, 464713) Who can know of his good efforts?
('66', 259, 10, 19, 464747) God alone knows the secrets of the human heart.
('66', 259, 10, 20, 464795) Thus we must not make comparative reckoning of others’ sins but only increase the spirit of forgiveness.
('66', 259, 10, 21, 464900) This is one of the aims of the doctrine of ahimsa.

('66', 260, 3, 4, 465155) DEAR DAUGHTER AMTUSSALAAM,
('66', 260, 4, 5, 465182) I had your letter.
('66', 260, 4, 6, 465201) There was nothing worth wiring about.
('66', 260, 4, 7, 465239) And does my wire carry any weight now?
('66', 260, 4, 8, 465278) If you would heed me, you would (1) come to me or (2) go to Bombay or (3) to Indore or (4) to Patiala.
('66', 260, 4, 9, 465381) Going or living anywhere else should be considered a sin.
('66', 260, 4, 10, 465439) Otherwise you may do what you like.
('66', 260, 4, 11, 465475) What can I say to you or do about you?
('66', 260, 4, 12, 465514) God alone can help you.

('66', 260, 9, 17, 465645) MY DEAR MALKANI,
('66', 260, 10, 18, 465662) I have written to Dialdas.
('66', 260, 10, 19, 465689) 1 Wrote in the train after leaving Delhi.
('66', 260, 10, 20, 465731) Why these proceedings although the H. Q. had given the permission?
('66', 260, 10, 21, 465798) If the building operations are to take more than a month to commence, you do not need to detain Brijkishen.
('66', 260, 10, 22, 465906) As it is, he is not free to come immediately.
('66', 260, 10, 23, 465952) Supposing a man is bed ridden, has all his people orthodox, he is able to pay and does pay a Harijan fund, that is not personal service.
('66', 260, 10, 24, 466089) But I agree that it would be better to add “also by employing Harijans wherever possible”.
('66', 260, 10, 25, 466180) By confining the mention to monetary contribu tions he has erred on the side of strictest honesty.

('66', 261, 6, 10, 466647) Your letter.
('66', 261, 6, 11, 466660) Why apologize for the length of your letter?
('66', 261, 6, 12, 466705) You do not write too often.
('66', 261, 6, 13, 466733) Mrs. S. 2 was here for a day.
('66', 261, 6, 14, 466763) She is a good, well meaning woman.
('66', 261, 6, 15, 466798) She told me she was with you.
('66', 261, 6, 16, 466828) Yes, the children have to be in Kodai for their health’s sake.
('66', 261, 6, 17, 466891) It grieves me to think that Menon has still to draw funds from Denmark.
('66', 261, 6, 18, 466963) But of this we must talk when we meet.
('66', 261, 6, 19, 467002) So Maria cannot go home!
('66', 261, 6, 20, 467027) It is no easy work to love India with all one’s heart.
('66', 261, 6, 21, 467082) Send my love to Nellie Ball when you write to her.

('66', 262, 4, 5, 467545) Kirloskar and his principal staff are with me today.
('66', 262, 4, 6, 467598) They are all eager to have the decision about their machine one way or the other.
('66', 262, 4, 7, 467680) I have told them that it is not for me to give a decision.
('66', 262, 4, 8, 467739) That can be given solely by the judges.
('66', 262, 4, 9, 467779) I have told them too that whatever the decision, it will be given effect to.
('66', 262, 4, 10, 467856) If it is in their favour, they will get the prize money at once against the legal transfer of patent rights and the other necessary formalities.
('66', 262, 4, 11, 468001) They are anxious to have the decision as early as possible.
('66', 262, 4, 12, 468061) Please, therefore, expedite the matter as much as possible.

('66', 262, 9, 21, 468463) BHAI THAKKAR BAPA,
('66', 262, 10, 22, 468482) I did not like your letter regarding Surajbehn.
('66', 262, 10, 23, 468530) What will I do if both you and Karsandas wash your hands of her?
('66', 262, 10, 24, 468595) I have nothing to say if you feel that I am doing injustice to that woman, however slight it may be.
('66', 262, 10, 25, 468696) My strength lies in my devotion to truth and my sense of justice.
('66', 262, 10, 26, 468762) Remember that you are bound by your word to put an end to this episode.
('66', 262, 10, 27, 468834) If the debt incurred by Ganesan is in connection with Kodamakam [Ashram] alone, then pay it off and hand over the charge with a clean slate to the new manager.
('66', 262, 10, 28, 468994) Advise me about taking Harijan to Poona.
('66', 262, 10, 29, 469035) I am not able to see my way very clearly.
('66', 262, 10, 30, 469077) I see it clearly that it is my duty to retain the services of Harijan Shastri but I cannot decide whether to entrust him

('66', 263, 8, 11, 469533) I have your letter.
('66', 263, 8, 12, 469553) I learn from Devdas’s letter from Delhi that Kelkar is in Delhi and doing well.
('66', 263, 8, 13, 469633) The account of the yajna at Kurundwad is painful.
('66', 263, 8, 14, 469683) All the news about the Village Industries Association appears in Harijan and Harijansevak.
('66', 263, 8, 15, 469774) If you are not getting them, shall I send them?
('66', 263, 8, 16, 469822) Would it suit you to become a member and agent of the Association?
('66', 263, 8, 17, 469889) The silk industry has not been left out of the programme of the Association.
('66', 263, 8, 18, 469966) That work is carried on through the Spinners’ Association.

('66', 264, 6, 8, 470743) I have just finished reading your precious letter.
('66', 264, 6, 9, 470794) My heart was weeping as I was reading it.
('66', 264, 6, 10, 470836) Do you know this Tamil proverb— “ Thikkatravanukku theivamay thunai”?
('66', 264, 6, 11, 470906) It means God is the help of the helpless.
('66', 264, 6, 12, 470948) He will help you and comfort you.
('66', 264, 6, 13, 470982) You must not lose faith in His mercy and His healing power.
('66', 264, 6, 14, 471042) You should have written to me much earlier than you have done.
('66', 264, 6, 15, 471105) But better late than never.
('66', 264, 6, 16, 471133) You should tell Menon all that the children feel.
('66', 264, 6, 17, 471183) What is done is done.
('66', 264, 6, 18, 471205) God had a purpose behind this marriage.
('66', 264, 6, 19, 471245) You are neither spent nor bent.
('66', 264, 6, 20, 471277) You way is clear.
('66', 264, 6, 21, 471295) You should take the children to Denmark or England if your expenses can be easily found.
('66', 264, 6, 22, 471384) If you cannot stand that climate, you should return to India leaving the children to the care of those who would take them.
('66', 264, 6, 23, 471508) If this is not possible, you should live on a hill where you can be all the year round and bring them up as Indians in Indian surroundings.
('66', 264, 6, 24, 471648) I think they are too good to resist this.
('66', 264, 6, 25, 471690) To bring them up in India in a European school is fatal for their moral growth.
('66', 264, 6, 26, 471770) Of course I should love to have you and the children by my side.
('66', 264, 6, 27, 471835) But they won’t stand the climate and probably the surroundings also.
('66', 264, 6, 28, 471904) Do not hesitate to write to me as often as you need.
('66', 264, 6, 29, 471957) I am well enough to attend to your letters.
('66', 264, 6, 30, 472001) I tried to secure something good for Menon but failed, i.e., I could not secure the salary he would need.
('66', 264, 6, 31, 472107) But if he is freed of the care of the children and even you, he can take up an ill paid post but one in which he will have ample experience.

('66', 265, 6, 12, 472857) Many young men today are not even prepared to listen to the words of their parents, whereas there are others who would not tolerate anything from their parents but would put up with a great deal from those whom they regard as their friends.
('66', 265, 6, 13, 473098) Thus, everything depends on individuals and circumstances.
('66', 265, 6, 14, 473157) You have taken the right step.
('66', 265, 6, 15, 473188) Rambhau will be leaving today.

('66', 266, 3, 4, 473709) MANILAL, I have received your letter.
('66', 266, 3, 5, 473747) There is a verse 1 in Sanskrit.
('66', 266, 3, 6, 473779) It means: “Speak the truth, speak the pleasant and do not speak unpleasant truth.” It means that the truth should always be non violent.
('66', 266, 3, 7, 473916) One should learn non violent language for criticism.
('66', 266, 3, 8, 473969) You or anyone else writing it could have expressed the same thing in a sweet language.
('66', 266, 3, 9, 474056) One cannot acquire sweet language without getting rid of anger.
('66', 266, 3, 10, 474120) In your article and letter I see marks of anger.
('66', 266, 3, 11, 474169) I write this not as a reproach but only to caution you.
('66', 266, 3, 12, 474225) Otherwise there is no point in criticizing you from this distance.
('66', 266, 3, 13, 474292) I feel, however, that it is proper to tell you what impression your language creates.
('66', 266, 3, 14, 474378) Take it that Ramdas has settled here.
('66', 266, 3, 15, 474416) He will be a partner in the press.
('66', 266, 3, 16, 474451) He is keeping well.

('66', 267, 5, 8, 475428) [Before March 1, 1935] 3
('66', 267, 6, 9, 475453) Q. You do not seem to have regard to the question of leisure.
('66', 267, 6, 10, 475515) Too much work Ieaves little leisure to the poorer classes for any intellectual thinking and recreation, and you are now seeking to make them work more.
('66', 267, 7, 11, 475667) A. Is that really so?
('66', 267, 7, 12, 475689) I am trying to deal with people who do not know what to do with their enforced leisure.
('66', 267, 7, 13, 475777) It is their enforced idleness that has made them like so many lifeless stones.
('66', 267, 7, 14, 475856) There is such inertia that some of them do not want to be disturbed.
('66', 267, 8, 15, 475925) Q. You will certainly give employment where it is needed.
('66', 267, 8, 16, 475983) But are you not putting an excessive emphasis on dull monotonous work when you ask them to grind their own corn and husk their own rice?
('66', 267, 9, 17, 476120) A. It is no more monotonous than the idle hours hanging heavy on their hands, and it will cease to be monotonous when they realize that they not only earn a few coppers but preserve their own health and that of their countrymen.
('66', 267, 9, 18, 476349) It is certainly not more monotonous than working away in modern factories.
('66', 267, 9, 19, 476424) Any work, however humdrum, which does not take away the joy of creating something, is not monotonous.
('66', 267, 9, 20, 476526) You go to a huge shoe making factory.
('66', 267, 9, 21, 476564) Some people would be engaged in making soles, some in making the uppers, some in doing other parts.
('66', 267, 9, 22, 476664) This is monotonous, for they work without intelligence, but there is no monotony about the work of the shoe maker who makes the whole shoe himself.
('66', 267, 9, 23, 476812) His work will bear the impress of his skill, and he will have the joy of having created
('66', 267, 10, 24, 476900) 1 G. D. Birla was at this time acting as intermediary between Malaviya and Gandhiji.

('66', 267, 10, 26, 477034) Desai does not identify Gandhiji’s interlocutor.
('66', 267, 10, 27, 477083) 3 Mahadev Desai left Wardha for Bombay on March 1, 1935, vide “Letter to Narahari D. Parikh”, 2 3 1935

('66', 268, 1, 2, 477233) something himself.
('66', 268, 1, 3, 477252) No, almost everything depends on the spirit in which a thing is done.
('66', 268, 1, 4, 477322) I would not mind being my own drawer of water and hewer of wood, provided I am doing the work intelligently and not because someone compels me to do so.
('66', 268, 1, 5, 477475) All labour when done intelligently and to some high purpose becomes at once re creation and recreation.
('66', 268, 2, 6, 477579) Q. Pardon me, but when you insist on pure and simple physical work all day long, don’t you run the risk of making them intellectually dull?
('66', 268, 2, 7, 477719) How many hours of physical work you think are necessary?
('66', 268, 3, 8, 477776) A. I would not mind working eight hours myself.
('66', 268, 4, 9, 477824) Q. I do not mean yourself.
('66', 268, 4, 10, 477851) You have enough intellectual energy and creative talent to fill the rest of your hours.
('66', 268, 4, 11, 477939) Yours should be regarded as an exceptional case.
('66', 268, 4, 12, 477988) I know you can derive joy from eight hours’ spinning.
('66', 268, 5, 13, 478042) A. No, I want everyone to derive joy out of eight hours’ work.
('66', 268, 5, 14, 478105) Everything depends on the spirit in which work is done, and an eight hours’ day of honest, clean labour leaves one enough time for intellectual pursuits.
('66', 268, 5, 15, 478259) My object is to put an end to inertia and lethargy, and I would be immensely satisfied when I tell the world that every villager of India is earning Rs. 20 a month by the sweat of his brow.

('66', 268, 7, 17, 478467) 386. NOTE
('66', 268, 8, 18, 478477) ECONOMICS, FALSE AND TRUE
('66', 268, 9, 19, 478503) A friend has sent me the following extract from Dr. F. D. Farrell, President of the Kansas State College:
('66', 268, 10, 20, 478609) Social values must not be sacrificed for economic values.
('66', 268, 10, 21, 478667) One of the greatest futilities is to progress economically and retrogress socially.
('66', 268, 10, 22, 478751) We all need to recognize that we work and strive so that we may live better, rather than that we live solely that we may work and strive.
('66', 268, 10, 23, 478889) If we live badly, we are poor, no matter how much money we have.
('66', 268, 11, 24, 478954) Adversity is impressing large numbers of farm people with this fact.
('66', 268, 11, 25, 479023) Thus, it is laying the foundation for the acceptance of a rural philosophy that seems likely in the end to prevail.
('66', 268, 11, 26, 479139) This philosophy holds that the chief objective of farming is not to accumulate monetary wealth, but to promote human happiness in the countryside that the farm should be regarded primarily as a home and only incidentally as a business enterprise.
('66', 268, 12, 27, 479386) Adversity is teaching many of us to enjoy the non monetary wealth with which we are surrounded.
('66', 268, 12, 28, 479482) This wealth includes an endless variety of things
('66', 269, 0, 1, 479532) 270 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 269, 1, 2, 479574) from which happiness and satisfaction may be extracted: things ranging all the way from gorgeous sunsets to the companionship of children.
('66', 269, 1, 3, 479713) By living simply and depending largely on our non monetary wealth, we may find not only health and l happiness, but also a large measure of economic security.
('66', 269, 1, 4, 479872) Indeed, economics that ruins one’s health is false, because money without health has no value.
('66', 269, 1, 5, 479967) Only that economy is true which enables one to conserve one’s health.
('66', 269, 1, 6, 480037) The whole of the initial programme of village re construction is, therefore, aimed at true economy, because it is aimed at promoting the health and vigour of the villagers.
('66', 269, 2, 7, 480210) A SHAME
('66', 269, 3, 8, 480218) A strongly built young man of about 25 years presented himself to me only yesterday and asked me whether he could stay with me for two or three days.
('66', 269, 3, 9, 480368) He hails from Bahraich.
('66', 269, 3, 10, 480392) His people have a few acres of land.
('66', 269, 3, 11, 480429) He attended the Bombay Congress.
('66', 269, 3, 12, 480462) Ever since he has been travelling and living on the hospitality of strangers.
('66', 269, 3, 13, 480540) He mixes with Ramanujis.
('66', 269, 3, 14, 480565) They, he tells me, give him food andsomething towards his railway fare.
('66', 269, 3, 15, 480637) On my telling him that living as he was doing on charity was not right, his retort was: “I see nothing wrong in my begging for my food and expenses, as I expect to serve the people.” He could see no incongruity in demanding his maintenance first and then expecting, at some distant date, to render service against maintenance plus, of course wages.
('66', 269, 3, 16, 480986) As he had come at the dinner hour, I invited him to share the meal with us.
('66', 269, 3, 17, 481062) I told him after the meal that he could not stay with us any longer, unless he was prepared to labour with us the whole day long and do the work allotted to him.
('66', 269, 3, 18, 481224) Up to the time of writing he has not been seen by any of us.
('66', 269, 4, 19, 481285) I wish it was possible to say that this was the first case of its kind that came under my observation.
('66', 269, 4, 20, 481388) Young men and women should be ashamed of begging for the supply of their wants.
('66', 269, 4, 21, 481468) If the sense of shame that wrongly attaches to physical labour could be got rid of, there is work enough and to spare for young men and women of average intelligence.

('66', 270, 1, 2, 481830) 387. MANURE PITS
('66', 270, 2, 3, 481847) Mr. Brayne, Commissioner, Rural Reconstruction, Punjab has sent me, at my request, a parcel of literature published by him.
('66', 270, 2, 4, 481971) This contains useful leaflets of general information to the villagers.
('66', 270, 2, 5, 482042) From these, I propose to publish a selection from time to time.
('66', 270, 2, 6, 482106) I take first the bulletin 1 on Manure Pits: One can subscribe to all that is said here.
('66', 270, 2, 7, 482194) I know that the pits such as Mr. Brayne suggests are generally recommended.
('66', 270, 2, 8, 482270) In my opinion, however, superficial burial recommended by Poore is more scientific and more remunerative.
('66', 270, 2, 9, 482376) The cost of digging is lessened and that of removal avoided altogether or certainly lessened.
('66', 270, 2, 10, 482470) Add to this the fact that the excreta are turned into manure in almost a week’s time, for the reason that the bacteria, which live within six or nine inches of the surface of the earth, and the air and the rays of the sun act upon the excreta and turn them into sweet manure much more quickly than when the refuse is buried deep.
('66', 270, 2, 11, 482800) But the chief thing to remember is not the various methods of disposing of refuse so much as the necessity of burying all the refuse for the double purpose of promoting the villagers’ health and their material condition through the better yield of their crops which the manure must produce.
('66', 270, 2, 12, 483091) It should be remembered that organic rubbish other than excreta must be separately buried.
('66', 270, 2, 13, 483182) Attention to hygiene is undoubtedly the first step to village reconstruction.

('66', 270, 7, 19, 483437) Sumitra is a good, hard working woman.
('66', 270, 7, 20, 483476) But you will test for yourself.

('66', 271, 4, 5, 483946) I have your very wonderful letter.
('66', 271, 4, 6, 483981) You must shed this fear complex of your inability to earn your bread by the sweat of your brow.
('66', 271, 4, 7, 484077) I am not going to criticize anything just now.
('66', 271, 4, 8, 484124) You must continue to give me a vivid description of your labours and I will tell you whenever I think you are going the wrong way.
('66', 271, 4, 9, 484255) Only both of you, all of you, must keep well.

('66', 271, 9, 14, 484448) Mahadev left for Bombay last night.
('66', 271, 9, 15, 484484) I am forwarding your letter there.
('66', 271, 9, 16, 484519) Do you know Hira Singh’s relatives?
('66', 271, 9, 17, 484555) You must have informed them.
('66', 271, 9, 18, 484584) I am sure he must have been cremated.
('66', 271, 9, 19, 484622) Who attended the funeral?
('66', 271, 9, 20, 484648) Where was Hira Singh sleeping?
('66', 271, 9, 21, 484679) Is the place all right?
('66', 271, 9, 22, 484703) Was he sleeping on the cot or on the ground?
('66', 271, 9, 23, 484748) I for one believe that everyone dies at his appointed hour.
('66', 271, 9, 24, 484808) But since one does not know that hour and death is unpleasant, one has to take treatment.
('66', 271, 9, 25, 484898) That being so, when one does not know what has bitten one, one should presume it was a snake and take remedies accordingly.
('66', 271, 9, 26, 485022) Of course the patient can be taken to a doctor but if a doctor is not available there is always the remedy of stopping the flow of the blood in the vessel, making an incision over the bite thus letting out blood, filling it with potassium permanganate, covering it with a mud pack and making the patient keep awake.

('66', 272, 7, 14, 486170) I have your two letters.
('66', 272, 7, 15, 486195) Yes, the Khan Brothers are truly servants of God.
('66', 272, 7, 16, 486245) I am glad you were able to go through the book at a single sitting.
('66', 272, 7, 17, 486313) You should get some copies from Devdas, free if you like, and send them to your English friends.
('66', 272, 7, 18, 486410) The paper that Jugulkishore has sent you has the defect you point out.
('66', 272, 7, 19, 486481) I am making investigations to see if improvement can be made.
('66', 272, 7, 20, 486543) Envelopes should present no difficulty.
('66', 272, 7, 21, 486583) They can be neatly prepared by hand.
('66', 272, 7, 22, 486620) The making of them may by itself become an occupation.
('66', 272, 7, 23, 486675) Do the ones I have sent you lack the finish?
('66', 272, 7, 24, 486720) You may not wait for adopting khaddar till you have used up all your mill made saris.
('66', 272, 7, 25, 486806) There is any amount of beauty to be found among hand spun stuffs.
('66', 272, 7, 26, 486872) Of course hand spun silk is khadi.
('66', 272, 7, 27, 486907) Please give my love to Maharaj Singh and his wife.
('66', 272, 7, 28, 486958) You may not know that my second son is editor of a S. A. paper called Indian Opinion.
('66', 272, 7, 29, 487044) He is a good young man.
('66', 272, 7, 30, 487068) He did net like Maharaj Singh’s policy and attacked him fiercely in his paper.
('66', 272, 7, 31, 487147) Andrews and I reasoned with the boy for the manner of his attack but we failed to convince him of the error of his method.
('66', 272, 7, 32, 487270) He is an obstinate boy.
('66', 272, 7, 33, 487294) I told him I did not mind his criticism where he disapproved of a policy but I reasoned with him as to the manner of his approach.
('66', 272, 7, 34, 487425) I am still trying.
('66', 272, 7, 35, 487444) I remain unconvinced by Mrs. B. Nehru’s argument.

('66', 273, 0, 1, 487503) 274 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 273, 1, 2, 487545) is that we as reformers may not do the work of prosecution.
('66', 273, 1, 3, 487605) The sanatanists will pay the fines and put up the Harijans against us.
('66', 273, 1, 4, 487676) I am quite clear in my mind that we have to begin with the so called higher classes who are the real culprits.
('66', 273, 1, 5, 487787) That Harijans know sometimes that they are contravening the Sarda Act does not affect my argument.
('66', 273, 1, 6, 487886) They are still ignorant of the wrongdoing.
('66', 273, 1, 7, 487929) Mere defiance of law has ceased to be a wrong in itself.
('66', 273, 1, 8, 487986) My argument holds good even for the women’s organization.
('66', 273, 1, 9, 488044) You may show this to Mrs. B. N. Naturally, if my reasoning does not convince you, you will ignore it.

('66', 273, 6, 27, 488722) Will it do if I send it with someone who is going there?
('66', 273, 6, 28, 488779) I am not surprised that Devdas and Lakshmi look after you and love you.
('66', 273, 6, 29, 488851) If it was otherwise, I should have been surprised as well as unhappy.

('66', 274, 2, 3, 489087) March 4, 1935
('66', 274, 3, 4, 489101) BHAI PARIKSHITLAL,
('66', 274, 4, 5, 489120) If we talk of ideals, the Harijan workers who participated in the Santaram celebrations can be said to have violated the rule.
('66', 274, 4, 6, 489247) But it can be argued that perhaps it was proper under the prevailing circumstances there.
('66', 274, 4, 7, 489337) This issue is not at all worth discussing in public.
('66', 274, 4, 8, 489390) The workers had the right to do what they felt was proper in the situation existing there.
('66', 274, 4, 9, 489481) We cannot set ourselves up as judges of the world.

('66', 274, 8, 13, 489631) March 4, 1935 It will not be necessary for you to attend any function that may be arranged in connection with the Silver Jubilee celebrations.
('66', 274, 8, 14, 489774) If it is clear, however, that your not attending will harm the Corporation, you ought to go.
('66', 274, 8, 15, 489867) The same rule applies to social functions.
('66', 274, 8, 16, 489910) You should remember that we are not practising non co operation these days.
('66', 274, 8, 17, 489986) That part of the programme has been suspended.
('66', 274, 8, 18, 490033) A municipal councillor, therefore, may serve the city in whatever manner he can consistently with his freedom, self respect and popularity.
('66', 274, 8, 19, 490173) Having said this, I need not give illustrations.
('66', 274, 8, 20, 490222) If you want, however, I shall think up some.
('66', 274, 8, 21, 490267) When you feel that you are not in a position to serve but on the contrary are likely to endanger your self respect, it will be your duty to resign and give reasons for your action.
('66', 274, 8, 22, 490448) Do whatever you can in the fields of Harijan work, prohibition, khadi, village industries, etc.
('66', 274, 8, 23, 490544) The Government it is true has not left much scope for such work.
('66', 274, 8, 24, 490609) But we also are a good deal to blame for that.
('66', 274, 8, 25, 490656) As you see, we are able to do nothing about Hindu Muslim unity.
('66', 274, 8, 26, 490720) However, this fact is not a reason for yielding to despair but for intensifying our efforts.

('66', 275, 10, 17, 491363) If she is not in a hurry, she should come after the 18th.
('66', 275, 10, 18, 491421) The meetings will continue till then.
('66', 275, 10, 19, 491459) Here everyone eats unpolished rice and with great relish.
('66', 275, 10, 20, 491517) It cooks well.
('66', 275, 10, 21, 491532) It is first soaked in water for twelve hours and then put in boiling water.
('66', 275, 10, 22, 491608) Washing the rice vigorously two or three times has the same effect as pounding.
('66', 275, 10, 23, 491688) Such washing, therefore, is tantamount to polishing, and is therefore harmful.
('66', 275, 10, 24, 491767) I only wanted to point out this easy method to those who eat their rice polished.

('66', 277, 4, 7, 493565) You know that though I have not always been able to accept the political views propounded by The Leader, I have always had a very high regard for it.

('66', 277, 9, 13, 493866) MY DEAR AGATHA,
('66', 277, 10, 14, 493882) I have your letter of 24th ultimo.
('66', 277, 10, 15, 493917) You are quite clear.
('66', 277, 10, 16, 493938) I have no difficulty in reaching the heart of your letters.
('66', 277, 10, 17, 493998) I know why you want me not to precipitate matters.
('66', 277, 10, 18, 494049) Sometimes l may appear to others to do so, but it is contrary to my nature to act hastily; and at the present moment I am doubly circumspect, for the simple reason that my own ahimsa is on trial.
('66', 277, 10, 19, 494245) It is not enough for me to protest my innocence.
('66', 277, 10, 20, 494294) If I have it in me, it must be self luminous even as the sun.
('66', 277, 10, 21, 494356) I suppose even the blind, though they do not see the sun, feel the dawn when it is coming.
('66', 277, 10, 22, 494447) The noon day heat, of course, they cannot help feeling.
('66', 277, 10, 23, 494503) And when a man is filled with love, it must be like the noon day sun.
('66', 277, 10, 24, 494573) I may fail to express such ahimsa during this lifetime.
('66', 277, 10, 25, 494629) I shall proclaim that failure from the housetops rather than alter by a hair’s breadth the standard I have set before me.
('66', 277, 10, 26, 494751) Just at the present moment, therefore, I can say that any action hastening Civil Resistance is highly improbable.
('66', 277, 10, 27, 494865) But if it does come, I have no doubt that you will say that

('66', 281, 8, 19, 500110) You will be going to England in a few months.
('66', 281, 8, 20, 500156) It would be proper then to talk to Barlow and others.
('66', 281, 8, 21, 500210) But it cannot possibly result in any rights being granted 1. At the same time it is also necessary to make clear that anything workable can be negotiated only with the political leaders.
('66', 281, 8, 22, 500397) In the prevailing atmosphere no agreement unrelated to politics is possible.
('66', 281, 8, 23, 500474) Writing this will not lead to any misunderstanding.

('66', 282, 1, 2, 500673) 409. WELL BEGUN
('66', 282, 2, 3, 500689) A sister 1 who in conjunction with another 2 has just begun work in a little village in C. P. writes a deeply interesting and earnest letter from which I take the following extract: 3
('66', 282, 3, 4, 500873) There is much more that is valuable in the letter before me.
('66', 282, 3, 5, 500934) But I resist the temptation to quote more.
('66', 282, 3, 6, 500977) I must not divide with other items 4 the emphasis which I wish to lay on the necessity for village workers of labouring like the villagers, which the quotation so clearly recognizes.
('66', 282, 3, 7, 501160) If these two sisters are blessed by God with health and can stick to their work for long, if not for life, they will certainly make of their village a model—not merely because they have begun with physical labour, but also because of the propriety of their whole scheme of work and the selfless love of the villagers which fires them.

('66', 282, 4, 9, 501513) 410. A BAFFLING PROBLEM
('66', 282, 5, 10, 501537) An honours graduate writes:
('66', 282, 6, 11, 501565) I am a native of Rayalaseema 5 now in the grip of famine.
('66', 282, 6, 12, 501623) The reasons for the deplorable distress which should move the hearts of all the people of India are:
('66', 282, 7, 13, 501724) (1) The awful neglect of the minor irrigation works essential for water supply for daily and irrigation purposes in this rainless uplands region.
('66', 282, 8, 14, 501870) (2) Awful neglect of the domestic industries including hand spinning and weaving, which were brought to life by your work in the other parts of the country but not in this region.
('66', 282, 9, 15, 502050) (3) Awful ignorance and want of education, ancient or modern, among the people and their everlasting engagement in factious fights and criminal litigation.
('66', 282, 9, 16, 502206) Hence, more than famine relief work, famine protection work is absolutely necessary to making the life of the people of this region worth living at all.
('66', 282, 9, 17, 502359) The third is, perhaps, not a cause but a result of the first two causes.
('66', 282, 9, 18, 502432) And if the first is substantial and cannot be or is not remedied,

('66', 282, 10, 20, 502589) The correspondent had written about the manual labour she had been doing constructing a verandah in her house.
('66', 282, 10, 21, 502700) She had further added that after completing the verandah she intended to take up gardening.

('66', 283, 1, 2, 502889) the alternatives before the unhappy inhabitants of these regions are death from starvation or migration from that waterless land.
('66', 283, 1, 3, 503019) It is, however, likely that the situation is not so hopeless as my correspondent describes.
('66', 283, 1, 4, 503111) In any case, I expect that the improvement in the matter of water supply is beyond the ability of private workers.
('66', 283, 1, 5, 503226) But if the conditions of life are at all tolerable, much can undoubtedly be done by right and honest effort in the direction of finding employment for the people.
('66', 283, 1, 6, 503389) There is so much waste material and waste labour in the country that if the two can be utilized, no one need starve.
('66', 283, 1, 7, 503506) There is no doubt that relief measures without simultaneous preventive measures are worse than useless.
('66', 283, 1, 8, 503610) They pauperise the people and turn them away from honest labour.
('66', 283, 1, 9, 503675) Relief measures can themselves be preventive.
('66', 283, 1, 10, 503721) Thus, instead of giving doles, organizers can organize local industries and invite the sufferers to engage in them.
('66', 283, 1, 11, 503837) No one who is not disabled should be fed unless he performs his allotted task.
('66', 283, 1, 12, 503916) In my opinion, intelligent labour is for the time being the only primary and adult education in this land of starving millions.
('66', 283, 1, 13, 504044) Literary education should follow the education of the hand—the one gift that visibly distinguishes man from beast.
('66', 283, 1, 14, 504159) It is a superstition to think that the fullest development of man is impossible without a knowledge of the art of reading and writing.
('66', 283, 1, 15, 504294) That knowledge undoubtedly adds grace to life, but is in no way indispensable for man’s moral, physical or material growth.
('66', 283, 1, 16, 504418) It is, therefore, to be wished that the graduate correspondent and all the workers whom we can muster together would live in the midst of the sufferers and apply themselves to the constructive task of finding work on the spot for them, so as to enable them to feel the dignity that belongs to the man who earns his bread honestly.

('66', 289, 5, 10, 512100) March 9, 1935
('66', 289, 6, 11, 512114) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('66', 289, 6, 12, 512147) I think the letter from the secretary of the A. I. V. I. A. is quite proper.
('66', 289, 6, 13, 512224) What we want to do is not to carry on a campaign of prohibition, which can only come through the State and which is the proper subject to be taken up by somebody.
('66', 289, 6, 14, 512387) But what the A. I. V. I. A. seeks to do is to convert the drunkard to abstemiousness.
('66', 289, 6, 15, 512473) After all you yourself do admit that your picketing could not produce a permanent effect.
('66', 289, 6, 16, 512563) Picketing is a valuable thing up to a point and for a time.
('66', 289, 6, 17, 512623) It cannot become a permanent institution and then according to the principle of the division of labour it cannot be done by one and the same organization.
('66', 289, 6, 18, 512778) A. I. V. I. A. is purely constructive and therefore it must confine itself to teaching people abstemiousness.
('66', 289, 6, 19, 512888) It cannot take up also the work of picketing and move the State to declare prohi bition.
('66', 289, 6, 20, 512977) For that another body has to be created.
('66', 289, 6, 21, 513018) You have therefore to make your choice.
('66', 289, 6, 22, 513058) Either work from without or work from within.
('66', 289, 6, 23, 513104) Both are necessary and no rule can be laid down as to what a person should do.
('66', 289, 6, 24, 513183) That choice has to be made by each one for himself.

('66', 290, 4, 6, 513443) I am sorry that Sastri or Ganesan took all these many months to discharge a small amount.

('66', 290, 10, 18, 513976) The telegram said: “Do come.

('66', 290, 10, 20, 514080) In view of your circumstances it seemed the correct thing.
('66', 290, 10, 21, 514139) But do come if thatis your wish.

('66', 291, 3, 5, 514813) He proposes to sail for England about the 23rd April next.
('66', 291, 3, 6, 514872) If the decision is to be arrived at before he sails, the matter has to be expedited.
('66', 291, 3, 7, 514957) I am under promise to you not to give my opinion to the judges.
('66', 291, 3, 8, 515021) I would strictly abide by that promise, so long as you wish me to do so, but if Sheth Ambalal represents the opinion of the other judges, there is just a danger of their either declining to give their decision, or give it against you on the grounds of insufficiency of evidence.
('66', 291, 3, 9, 515300) I felt therefore that I should let you know what was happening.
('66', 291, 3, 10, 515364) You will please let me know what you would like me to do.

('66', 293, 1, 3, 517808) I have advised that if the liabilities were incurred properly on behalf of the institution and if in spite of irregularities dishonesty could not be imputed to you and if the institution is found to be necessary for the cause, the whole of the liabilities should be discharged.
('66', 293, 1, 4, 518086) I have also said that if your honesty was questioned or your promises were proved to be entirely unreliable but the institution was useful, all the liabilities legitimately incurred on behalf of the institution should be discharged and you should be relieved of all connection with the institution.
('66', 293, 1, 5, 518385) And if the institution was not useful, the Harijan Sevak Sangh should withdraw its support or connection with it altogether.

('66', 293, 7, 12, 518631) I have your letter.
('66', 293, 7, 13, 518651) I am quite clear in my mind that the Sangh must not identify itself with any election campaign.
('66', 293, 7, 14, 518747) Its service of the cause must be judged on its own merits.
('66', 293, 7, 15, 518806) This does not mean that the public should not support deserving Harijan candidates or that parties which are interested in such things should not promote the election of suitable Harijan candidates to municipalities and local boards.
('66', 293, 7, 16, 519040) My only point is that the Harijan Sangh has a much superior task to claim its attention.

('66', 294, 3, 4, 519347) DEAR NIRMALBABU,
('66', 294, 4, 5, 519364) I have your note as also two numbers of Congress Socialist containing your articles which you will be glad to know I had already seen, Masani having brought them to my notice and given me the two copies.
('66', 294, 4, 6, 519568) I should not say that any of the articles contains an exposition of Varnashrama or non violence but in so far as you have touched upon either I can say that you have given a fairly correct representation of the two doctrines as I have known them.
('66', 294, 4, 7, 519815) As to the rest of the articles whilst you have made an endeavour to be fair to me, there are several things in them on which I do not agree that they are accurate.
('66', 294, 4, 8, 519979) I don’t think they correctly set forth the true state of things.
('66', 294, 4, 9, 520044) This is, however, of no importance.
('66', 294, 4, 10, 520080) It is enough that you have made your best endeavour to examine my position in an impartial spirit.
('66', 294, 4, 11, 520179) You will be glad to know that I have not forgotten your questions and answers.

('66', 294, 8, 19, 520537) 14) he says: “In February 1935, I had written two articles in the Congress Socialist, entitled ‘Is Gandhi a nationalist?’ The opinion had been expressed that he was after all, more of an internationalist, and more intimately tied to the poor people’s cause to be a ‘nationalist’, in the usual sense of the term.
('66', 294, 8, 20, 520849) But for the sake of India’s freedom, there had come about an alliance between the radical Gandhi and the nationalist forces; and the prediction was made that as Gandhi became more and more radical in action, the nationalist forces would tend to drop away from his company.
('66', 294, 8, 21, 521122) Copies of these two articles were despatched to Gandhi who wrote back from Wardha on the 11th of March 1935.”

('66', 295, 3, 5, 521373) It grieved me.

('66', 295, 3, 7, 521506) I am the cause of your anger, am I not?
('66', 295, 3, 8, 521546) After all Prabhavati only conveyed to you what instructions I had given her.
('66', 295, 3, 9, 521623) You ought to understand that a vow if taken must be observed too.
('66', 295, 3, 10, 521689) And why such contempt for the Ashram?
('66', 295, 3, 11, 521727) Can anyone contemptuous of the Ashram have any respect for me?
('66', 295, 3, 12, 521790) If there is no love for the Ashram, how can there be any love for me?
('66', 295, 3, 13, 521860) But can one argue against anger?
('66', 295, 3, 14, 521893) Anger is a kind of madness andwhen it subsides you will laugh at yourself.
('66', 295, 3, 15, 521968) After all we can be angry only with our own people, and who am I if not one of your own people?
('66', 295, 3, 16, 522064) The anger will have abated by now.
('66', 295, 3, 17, 522099) You must tell me of Mummy’s condition.
('66', 295, 3, 18, 522138) You will obey me in this at least, won’t you?
('66', 295, 3, 19, 522184) The ayah’s work will be done by the ayah and what Prabha was doing can be done by some other girl like her.
('66', 295, 3, 20, 522292) Just as you accepted Prabha on better acquaintance, so will you accept any other girl.
('66', 295, 3, 21, 522379) Supposing Khorshed or even Ba herself comes in place of Prabha!
('66', 295, 3, 22, 522443) Anyway I shall pull you by the ear and settle the score when we meet.

('66', 296, 4, 11, 523490) The process is not very troublesome.
('66', 296, 4, 12, 523527) If cold water cannot be tolerated, the washing can be done with lukewarm water.
('66', 296, 4, 13, 523607) If Father is willing to try this remedy and take the necessary trouble, let him practise it.
('66', 296, 4, 14, 523700) The only real means of purification, however, is Ramanama.

('66', 296, 9, 20, 523917) NARAHARI,
('66', 296, 10, 21, 523927) I have your letter.
('66', 296, 10, 22, 523947) I find it is a difficult task to rescue Kesar.
('66', 296, 10, 23, 523994) It is obviously impossible for you or for me to detain her against the wishes of her father.
('66', 296, 10, 24, 524087) Kesar should live wherever Uttamchand lives.
('66', 296, 10, 25, 524132) You should correspond with the person who intends to marry her.
('66', 296, 10, 26, 524196) Perhaps he might be induced to give up the thought of Kesar.
('66', 296, 10, 27, 524257) I think it is not proper to put Kesar in the Kanya Ashram here.
('66', 296, 10, 28, 524321) As for me, I am now in an entirely independent house.
('66', 296, 10, 29, 524375) It can be said that I am doing wholly different work.
('66', 296, 10, 30, 524429) How can a thirteen year old girl be accommodated in a place like the office where there is no provision for education and the like?
('66', 296, 10, 31, 524561) Uttamchand can protect Kesar provided she remains firm; but if she falters, no one can save her.
('66', 296, 10, 32, 524658) It seems Bhagwanji is tired and wants to spend some time with me.
('66', 296, 10, 33, 524724) If you can relieve him for a short time, the duration of which you

('66', 297, 1, 3, 524871) You alone should be responsible for the decision.

('66', 297, 13, 19, 525529) On inquiring of Kamala Devi about you, she told me that you were suffering from T.B. I was distressed.

('66', 298, 2, 3, 525891) [Before March 14, 1935] 2
('66', 298, 3, 4, 525917) Just a number of six inches wide and a foot deep trenches would do with open space in between, on which the earth dug out should be banked up in ridges, the people to use the two banks of the trench as seats.
('66', 298, 3, 5, 526126) This is the simplest device.
('66', 298, 3, 6, 526155) You have done the thing without any sense of shame all these years, and you may do without latrines.
('66', 298, 3, 7, 526256) But if you do want them, we could easily help in building them for you out of your own village materials.
('66', 298, 3, 8, 526362) All that you have to do is to cover the evacuations with the earth near by.
('66', 298, 3, 9, 526438) In eight days you will see that it is converted into rich manure, and you can have a rotation of suitable fodder or vegetable crops all the year round.
('66', 298, 3, 10, 526590) I am telling you from my own experience.
('66', 298, 3, 11, 526631) Your crops will be increased without any extra expense or effort, your health will improve, for the flies will carry no disease germs, and your village will be turned intoa clean spot.
('66', 298, 3, 12, 526816) Come along, then, will you come with your spades and shovels, or not?
('66', 298, 4, 13, 526886) ‘We will, we will,’ they exclaimed.

('66', 298, 8, 17, 526993) I shall explain it to you in a minute.
('66', 298, 8, 18, 527032) One of these ghanis probably costs nothing less than 50 rupees to make.
('66', 298, 8, 19, 527104) Now, if all stopped home pressing, there would be over 100,000 ghanis lying idle in the country.
('66', 298, 8, 20, 527201) I have allowed one press to seven villages —surely, an underestimate.
('66', 298, 8, 21, 527271) Think what it means.
('66', 298, 8, 22, 527292) Allow 30 rupees per ghani.
('66', 298, 8, 23, 527319) That means
('66', 298, 9, 24, 527330) 1 Extracted from Mahadev Desai’s “Weekly Notes”.
('66', 298, 9, 25, 527379) In the course of a sanitation campaign in the neighbourhood of Wardha, Gandhiji and party visited Ramnagar and Sindi and found the streets littered with excreta.
('66', 298, 9, 26, 527541) Gandhiji armed the party with shovels and buckets and began to remove the dirt.
('66', 298, 9, 27, 527621) The villagers joined.
('66', 298, 9, 28, 527643) He then addressed the villagers.
('66', 298, 9, 29, 527676) 2 Vide “Letter to Premabehn Kantak”,14 3 1935 3 Extracted from Mahadev Desai’s “Weekly Notes”.
('66', 298, 9, 30, 527771) Gandhiji had advised purchase of an idle village ghani (oil press).
('66', 298, 9, 31, 527839) But the friend who was asked to get this ghani and to install it had failed to see the rationale of the whole adventure.

('66', 299, 1, 2, 528029) that three millions of rupees worth of capital is lying idle!
('66', 299, 1, 3, 528091) Is it not a tragedy?
('66', 299, 1, 4, 528112) How can we allow this to run to waste?
('66', 299, 1, 5, 528151) And if we had all of them working, fancy the number of men they would employ, at the rate of only one man per each.
('66', 299, 1, 6, 528267) And, then, the tons and tons of oil cake that would be released for the half starved cows and bullocks.
('66', 299, 1, 7, 528371) The same is the case about our wooden sugar cane crushers.
('66', 299, 2, 8, 528430) But will the people listen?
('66', 299, 2, 9, 528458) It is to make them listen to us that we are having this ghani on our own land, that we are husking our own rice and grinding 1 our own flour.
('66', 299, 2, 10, 528600) But even if they will not listen, what then?
('66', 299, 2, 11, 528645) Supposing people will not listen to the gospel of truth and non violence, shall we ask them, then, to take to untruth and violence?
('66', 299, 2, 12, 528777) We have to go on doing what is the best thing for the nation and for the poor, who compose the nation, no matter what others do, or will not do.

('66', 299, 5, 16, 528998) PREMA, Now that there has been a second letter from you, I abandon the desire of writing in my own hand and dictate this.
('66', 299, 5, 17, 529120) Why should you apologize for the fact that the yarn with you is not enough?
('66', 299, 5, 18, 529196) If the yarn I sent is not enough for the purpose, what can you do?
('66', 299, 5, 19, 529263) Arun’s birthday comes some time in April.
('66', 299, 5, 20, 529305) I don’t remember the exact date.
('66', 299, 5, 21, 529338) It was mentioned in Sushila’s letter.
('66', 299, 5, 22, 529376) Your hand can probably be likened to Mira’s.
('66', 299, 5, 23, 529421) Of what use is a hand which has never become rough or developed sores through work?
('66', 299, 5, 24, 529505) No new car has arrived here at Jamnalalji’s place; he has only a horse carriage and a bullock cart.
('66', 299, 5, 25, 529605) Take unboiled milk, uncooked leafy vegetables and tamarind and see what happens.
('66', 299, 5, 26, 529686) Perhaps all the pimples will subside.

('66', 300, 1, 4, 530168) I am thinking of going again.
('66', 300, 1, 5, 530198) The problem of cleanliness in villages can be solved only if we ourselves become scavengers.
('66', 300, 1, 6, 530291) The picture of the village which you have given is as pathetic as it is true.
('66', 300, 1, 7, 530369) We have to transform such villages.
('66', 300, 1, 8, 530405) The task can be accomplished neither by intellectual power nor by physical force but only through the power of love.
('66', 300, 1, 9, 530522) You should derive what comfort you can from so much today.

('66', 300, 7, 18, 530865) I consider your staying on here futile; I shall not be able to endure your illness.
('66', 300, 7, 19, 530949) Go and stay where you can maintain your health.
('66', 300, 7, 20, 530997) I deem it best that you leave today.
('66', 300, 7, 21, 531034) If you have any questions to ask, ask them by post.
('66', 300, 7, 22, 531086) I certainly want to be a mother to you, but I have not the requisite ability.
('66', 300, 7, 23, 531164) A mother serves; she never expects service.
('66', 300, 7, 24, 531208) I have always taken service from you.
('66', 300, 7, 25, 531246) I don’t remember ever having served you.
('66', 300, 7, 26, 531287) A mother never commands; I have always commanded you.
('66', 300, 7, 27, 531341) What reassurance can I then give you?
('66', 300, 7, 28, 531379) Do go to the South with your mother.
('66', 300, 7, 29, 531416) There is no harm in your going to Pondicherry.
('66', 300, 7, 30, 531463) I do not like the idea of Banaras.
('66', 300, 7, 31, 531498) Where is there any Rajayoga there?
('66', 300, 7, 32, 531533) If not to Pondicherry, you may go to Dehra Dun, Almora, etc.
('66', 300, 7, 33, 531594) For the present Delhi will do.
('66', 300, 7, 34, 531625) Do whatever service you like to in Delhi.

('66', 301, 6, 8, 532040) Untouchability is responsible for more things than we know.
('66', 301, 6, 9, 532100) Now that attention is being drawn to village sanitation, it is becoming clear that the insanitation of villages and towns is chiefly due to the belief in untouchability.
('66', 301, 6, 10, 532270) For fear of touching our own dirt and, therefore, cleaning it, we wallow in dirt and have consigned our obvious duty to a portion of our kith and kin, and because they are rendering what is the most important service of all, we have made them lepers of society, untouchable and uncared for.
('66', 301, 6, 11, 532561) The only remedy for the removal of this social evil and curse is for every one of us to be his own scavengers.
('66', 301, 6, 12, 532672) We would then soon learn the art of cleanliness.
('66', 301, 6, 13, 532721) We would miss many of the most common diseases which are due to filth.
('66', 301, 6, 14, 532792) And we should at the same time serve an economic end.
('66', 301, 6, 15, 532846) G. I. Fowler states, in his Wealth and Waste, that a proper disposal of human excreta would realize Rs. 2 per head per year.
('66', 301, 6, 16, 532971) In the vast majority of cases, all this rich manure is being wasted and disease invited.
('66', 301, 6, 17, 533060) He quotes Prof.
('66', 301, 6, 18, 533076) Brultini, from his volume The Use of Waste Materials, who says that “nitrogen derived from the 282,000 residents of Delhi is sufficient to fertilize a minimum of 10,000 and maximum of 95,000 acres.” Because we do not know how to treat our scavengers, Delhi of ancient fame has pestilential spots of which we have to feel ashamed.
('66', 301, 6, 19, 533406) If we all become scavengers, we would know how to treat ourselves and how to turn what today is poison into rich food for plant life.
('66', 301, 6, 20, 533540) Thirty crores of the population of India should mean, according to Dr. Fowler, an annual gain of 60 crores of rupees to the country if we would but make a wise use of human excreta.
('66', 301, 6, 21, 533722) Let no one be appalled by the magnitude of the problem.
('66', 301, 6, 22, 533778) Those who have the conviction have to begin with themselves in the full faith that everybody else is bound to follow their example if their faith

('66', 302, 1, 2, 534007) outlasts the first flush of enthusiasm.
('66', 302, 1, 3, 534047) The word “faith” is, perhaps, not the proper word.
('66', 302, 1, 4, 534098) For the proposition that human excreta are as valuable as those of cattle is not a matter of faith but of daily experience.
('66', 302, 1, 5, 534222) What is required is eradication of age long inertia.
('66', 302, 1, 6, 534275) Sustained, intelligent application of a few today will be the common property of the many tomorrow.

('66', 302, 5, 10, 534440) MY DEAR HARIBHAU, I have your letter.
('66', 302, 5, 11, 534478) When I get the particulars from you, I shall try to write something on Paisa Mandal for the Harijan.
('66', 302, 5, 12, 534579) I hope that you have made it clear that you are the donor, though it is likely that I may acquire the merit.
('66', 302, 5, 13, 534688) You should not have had even a slight attack of dysentery from trying whole unhusked rice.
('66', 302, 5, 14, 534779) If it was under cooked, that rice should not have been eaten.
('66', 302, 5, 15, 534841) This rice is not to be taken as an infliction, but as an aid to health.
('66', 302, 5, 16, 534913) Every one of the workers if he honestly can, after thorough experimenting, must testify that whole rice is sweeter to the taste, that it requires to be eaten in smaller quantities than polished rice to produce the same satisfaction, and that it cannot in any way be injurious to the body.
('66', 302, 5, 17, 535202) I have no doubt that you will be the better for taking your milk with gur.
('66', 302, 5, 18, 535277) I hope you do not share the common superstition that gur cannot be taken with milk.
('66', 302, 5, 19, 535361) The situation of the Harijans in your part of the country has to be handled delicately and tactfully.
('66', 302, 5, 20, 535463) There can be no doubt that unless we have the general principle of drawing our workers from the villages, we shall make no headway, and in my opinion real swaraj consists in successfully tackling this age long problem.
('66', 302, 5, 21, 535682) Where have you procured the paper on which you have written?

('66', 302, 8, 26, 535846) March 15, 1935
('66', 302, 9, 27, 535861) BHAI THAKKAR BAPA, I have received your letter.
('66', 302, 9, 28, 535909) l have no objection to giving you some more time.
('66', 302, 9, 29, 535959) But I will find it objectionable if you sleep over the
('66', 303, 0, 1, 536014) 304 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 303, 1, 2, 536056) matter.
('66', 303, 1, 3, 536064) How much more time do you want?
('66', 303, 1, 4, 536096) The work will not be finished unless you fix a time limit.
('66', 303, 1, 5, 536155) Surajbehn had asked for a maximum of six months when she had come here.
('66', 303, 1, 6, 536227) She had told me that if it was possible she would vacate in only a month.
('66', 303, 1, 7, 536301) As far as I remember I had this talk in November.
('66', 303, 1, 8, 536351) Should I consider this the fourth month and May 31 as the final date?
('66', 303, 1, 9, 536421) I feel that it is improper to give in to that woman’s persistence.
('66', 303, 1, 10, 536488) Harijan’s Sastri is your responsibility.
('66', 303, 1, 11, 536529) I will shift Harijan to Poona and will see that the Sangh does not have to incur an expense of even one paisa on that.
('66', 303, 1, 12, 536648) But is it not our duty to maintain Sastri after making him leave his job?
('66', 303, 1, 13, 536722) He must be maintained if he is not a wholly useless person.
('66', 303, 1, 14, 536782) I am proceeding in the belief that he is not a worthless person.
('66', 303, 1, 15, 536847) Guide me, as you are my eyes as well as my ears.
('66', 303, 1, 16, 536896) I still adhere to what I wrote to you about Ganesan.
('66', 303, 1, 17, 536949) It will be a great achievement if you can settle the dispute between the Nattars and the Harijans.

('66', 303, 6, 21, 537149) VASUMATI,
('66', 303, 7, 22, 537159) I have your letter.
('66', 303, 7, 23, 537179) I had received the previous letter also but was waiting for the second one.
('66', 303, 7, 24, 537255) See that you do not have constipation.
('66', 303, 7, 25, 537294) I hope you do know that leafy vegetables can be grown anywhere.
('66', 303, 7, 26, 537358) The leaves certainly come up within seven days of the sowing.
('66', 303, 7, 27, 537420) If you take a farmer to a field in the vicinity of Bochasan, he will show you a few varieties of eatable leafy vegetables.
('66', 303, 7, 28, 537543) Some of these grow like grass—they are in fact grass.
('66', 303, 7, 29, 537597) It will serve your purpose even if you get ten or twenty leaves.
('66', 303, 7, 30, 537662) The people there are bound to have seeds of leafy vegetables.
('66', 303, 7, 31, 537724) Which house will not have fenugreek, mustard and coriander seeds?
('66', 303, 7, 32, 537790) Who are the guests?
('66', 303, 7, 33, 537810) What do you cook for them?
('66', 303, 7, 34, 537837) Is the rice you use unpolished?
('66', 303, 7, 35, 537869) How much time does it take to cook?
('66', 303, 7, 36, 537905) Does it take more time than polished rice?
('66', 303, 7, 37, 537948) You should measure time by a watch.

('66', 304, 6, 8, 538248) GANGABEHN,
('66', 304, 7, 9, 538259) Why do you long for my letters?
('66', 304, 7, 10, 538291) I do not write to you because I feel that you do not need my letters so much and that also saves time.
('66', 304, 7, 11, 538394) I do write if there is anything to say.
('66', 304, 7, 12, 538434) Moreover Kishorelal is here, so I get to know things from him and also let you know anything I want to convey through him.
('66', 304, 7, 13, 538557) I hope you are keeping well.
('66', 304, 7, 14, 538586) Know it for certain that you are making a big mistake if you are spending too much time with thedoctors.
('66', 304, 7, 15, 538691) Medical science is not the greatest need of the people of India or that of the world.
('66', 304, 7, 16, 538777) Perhaps you are aware that common experience does not prove that people are more healthy and freer from diseases where there are many doctors.
('66', 304, 7, 17, 538920) But they are more healthy when they strictly observe the laws of nature, i.e., cleanliness.
('66', 304, 7, 18, 539012) There was a Turkish woman here.
('66', 304, 7, 19, 539044) She said that in Turkey villagers were told to shun six things and one of these was doctors.
('66', 304, 7, 20, 539137) This does not mean that one should not make use of the knowledge one has obtained.
('66', 304, 7, 21, 539220) It only means that it should be used very sparingly and even while doing that people should be taught to prevent diseases.

('66', 305, 2, 3, 539531) March 16, 1935
('66', 305, 3, 4, 539546) MY DEAR ANAND AND BHAKTI, Though you have given me a long love letter I can only dictate and then too be brief.
('66', 305, 3, 5, 539658) Allow me to do so because I have hardly any time and because just now I can only write with the left hand.
('66', 305, 3, 6, 539765) I have what may be called the writer’s cramp.
('66', 305, 3, 7, 539811) You will be surprised to learn that I have never been able to read Utopia, though I have heard much in praise of it.
('66', 305, 3, 8, 539928) We are getting on with village work and trying to convert the 13 acres of ground that Jamnalalji has given us in Wardha into a model village.
('66', 305, 3, 9, 540070) We are very far from it.
('66', 305, 3, 10, 540095) But we are only just settling down.
('66', 305, 3, 11, 540131) You must some day not very far revisit India.
('66', 305, 3, 12, 540177) You know that third class travelling is not so difficult and that it is comparatively cheaper.
('66', 305, 3, 13, 540272) I hope you are getting your Harijan regularly.
('66', 305, 3, 14, 540319) Devdas is getting on very well: He and his wife are devoted to their baby.

('66', 305, 8, 21, 540578) DEAR FRIEND, I have now been able to trace the file you sent to me.
('66', 305, 8, 22, 540646) I am returning it to you by registered book post.
('66', 305, 8, 23, 540696) I have already expressed my sorrow for the destruction of the two samples that you had kindly sent me.
('66', 305, 8, 24, 540799) If you would send them again, I shall try them and report to you.
('66', 305, 8, 25, 540865) I would, however, say that preparation of these juices can hardly ever be part of any village industry.
('66', 305, 8, 26, 540969) They are not of any great value from the health point of view.
('66', 305, 8, 27, 541032) The latest researches show that these juices do not retain the vitamins of the fruits from which they are

('66', 306, 5, 8, 541364) MARY, I wonder if I replied to your previous letter.
('66', 306, 5, 9, 541417) Now I have your second letter.
('66', 306, 5, 10, 541448) You cannot always make people pay for medicines.
('66', 306, 5, 11, 541497) Always tell them that they ought to pay, whatever they can, not by way of fees but in order that people who cannot afford anything might be helped.
('66', 306, 5, 12, 541645) Where you find that people are taking advantage of you, you should resolutely refuse to let them have any medicines without payment.
('66', 306, 5, 13, 541778) Do not encourage people to come to you for medicines but lead them to a natural life and point out to them household nature cure remedies.
('66', 306, 5, 14, 541917) Of course cripples are to be fed and clothed without being expected to do any work.
('66', 306, 5, 15, 542001) They are a first charge on a well ordered society.
('66', 306, 5, 16, 542052) I understand what you say about the coolie question.
('66', 306, 5, 17, 542105) You were certainly entitled to ask your neighbour to help you without feeling dependent upon him.
('66', 306, 5, 18, 542203) There was no principle at stake.
('66', 306, 5, 19, 542236) Mary C.’s 2 method of doing everything herself even at the risk of losingtime is not to be lightly disposed of.
('66', 306, 5, 20, 542348) Local circumstances should determine the choice of a particular way where more than one are open to us.
('66', 306, 5, 21, 542452) If you have the slightest trace of dysentery it is absolutely necessary for you not to strain yourself in any way.
('66', 306, 5, 22, 542567) You have to do only light work.
('66', 306, 5, 23, 542599) I am not doing physical work.
('66', 306, 5, 24, 542629) What I am doing is the superintendence of the kitchen so as to bring it in line with village surroundings.
('66', 306, 5, 25, 542736) All servants have been dispensed with.
('66', 306, 5, 26, 542775) One only has been retained because he has undergone training enough himself to become one with us.
('66', 306, 5, 27, 542874) He is a member of the family.
('66', 306, 5, 28, 542904) He works side by side with everybody else.

('66', 307, 1, 3, 543185) Mary C. is quite wrong in holding that foreign industrialists are to be preferred to Indian industrialists.
('66', 307, 1, 4, 543293) I admit that there is not much room for choice but such as there is in favour of the indigenous gentry, for the simple reason that they cannot drain the wealth of the country and it is easier to deal with them than with the foreign industrialists who do not hesitate to make good their position by force of arms which they are able to wield effectively.
('66', 307, 1, 5, 543647) Their Indian counterpart is unarmed, and knows that he cannot play fast and loose with his dependents.
('66', 307, 1, 6, 543750) If you saw that your neighbours were in need of assistance during the harvesting season, it would certainly be your duty to offer your help without any expectation of return in the shape of helping you to build the verandah.
('66', 307, 1, 7, 543975) I have now your letter of 9th March in front of me.
('66', 307, 1, 8, 544027) I have a vivid recollection of our discussion over Duncan’s two chapters.
('66', 307, 1, 9, 544101) They had reference to the village worker.
('66', 307, 1, 10, 544143) You told me in the course of our discussion whilst you endorsed his views generally there were portions about which you thought he was over enthusiastic and highly emotional.
('66', 307, 1, 11, 544318) It was not a perfunctory discussion either.
('66', 307, 1, 12, 544362) You laid special stress upon his suggestion of wandering teachers who would go from village to village.
('66', 307, 1, 13, 544466) I think that this was the only point which would have been overlooked 1 had I not come across your letter of the 9th.

('66', 308, 5, 13, 545737) So I decided to reply by letter as there was no particular hurry about it.
('66', 308, 5, 14, 545812) Rajendrababu is going to Calcutta.
('66', 308, 5, 15, 545847) He will form his opinion after consultations there.

('66', 308, 5, 17, 545967) How can it be “joint action”?

('66', 308, 5, 19, 546045) A joint meeting of non Congressmen and Congressmen is understandable.

('66', 309, 2, 3, 546754) [On Or before March 18, 1935] 2
('66', 309, 3, 4, 546786) The pledge does bear a spiritual stamp.
('66', 309, 3, 5, 546826) The very fact that we are coming again and again to it indicates that the Board wants to discharge its duties strictly, consistently with the objects of the Association.
('66', 309, 3, 6, 546996) The Pledge was arrived at after the fullest deliberation, and the question whether it will affect the number of our members need not worry us at all.
('66', 309, 3, 7, 547146) The Board can go on with half a dozen members.
('66', 309, 3, 8, 547193) All that we have to do is to explain the implications of the pledge and then it should be left to him or her who subscribes to it to find out whether he or she can satisfy all the conditions.
('66', 309, 3, 9, 547385) The member will certainly ask himself at every step whether he is applying the best part of his energy and talent to the objects of the Association, that is to say, even whilst he is eating or travelling.
('66', 309, 3, 10, 547590) If you think it is a vague pledge, you may make it more concrete, but I do not think it is vague.
('66', 309, 3, 11, 547688) It is a gentlemen’s pledge, and each member is put upon his honour as to the interpretation of the pledge.
('66', 309, 3, 12, 547795) We may not pry into the details of a man’s life.
('66', 309, 3, 13, 547844) Let the man be his own judge.
('66', 309, 3, 14, 547874) Let me tell you that it is possible for an active solicitor to give all his talent and energy to the objects of the Association.
('66', 309, 3, 15, 548003) Thus he will give a different shape tohis office.
('66', 309, 3, 16, 548053) He will invest in reams and reams of hand made paper and village made ink and see that all the documents issuing from his office are on that paper and written in that ink.
('66', 309, 3, 17, 548225) He has a large staff in his office.
('66', 309, 3, 18, 548261) Whenever he has leisure, he will try to interest them in the Association and persuade them to confine themselves, as far as possible, to village made things.
('66', 309, 3, 19, 548419) And so on and so forth.

('66', 310, 1, 2, 548740) 456. DISCUSSION WITH MEMBERS OF A. I. V. I. A. 1
('66', 310, 2, 3, 548789) [On or before March 18, 1935] 2
('66', 310, 3, 4, 548821) A regular battle raged between Gandhiji and the scientist members from Bengal on the meaning of unpolished rice.
('66', 310, 3, 5, 548934) Some of the members ate for the first time here the full unpolished rice of Gandhiji’s definition, and some had understood by it the hand pounded, part polished rice which is still to be found in our villages.
('66', 310, 3, 6, 549144) But Gandhiji, who had taken his stand on medical opinion refused to yield an iota of his ground and contended that the pericarp, aleurone and embryo, containing vitamins that, according to medical opinion, were destroyed in mill polished rice, were all retained only in unhusked rice and could be retained in no other.
('66', 310, 3, 7, 549463) That they were so retained or could be so retained in once pounded or twice pounded rice had to be proved by the chemists and scientists.
('66', 310, 4, 8, 549601) [A MEMBER:] But rice pounded only once by the hand in the village dhenki is almost unpolished.
('66', 310, 4, 9, 549696) [GANDHIJI:] That is not how a scientist would talk.
('66', 310, 4, 10, 549748) Do we talk of an almost complete right angle?
('66', 310, 4, 11, 549794) A right angle is a right angle of 90 degrees, not less, not more.
('66', 310, 5, 12, 549860) But the people are so accustomed to the slightly polished rice that it is difficult to persuade them to take to the use of wholly unpolished rice.
('66', 310, 5, 13, 550007) A reformer will not argue like that.
('66', 310, 6, 14, 550044) It does not cook easily, and when cooked, it all becomes a lump and scares people away.
('66', 310, 6, 15, 550132) That it takes more time to cook is true, that it is delicious, and more delicious than the polished rice, has been proved beyond doubt; and after all, what is handsome to the eye may not be handsome after all.
('66', 310, 6, 16, 550342) Handsome is that handsome tastes.
('66', 310, 7, 17, 550376) [GOSIBEHN:] Don’t you murder good age old proverbs, Bapu, in the heat of your argument.
('66', 310, 7, 18, 550464) Well, what else can I do, when I am out to murder age old prejudices and superstitions?
('66', 310, 8, 19, 550552) The scientist members were adamant too.
('66', 310, 8, 20, 550592) Pericarp, they conceded, was lost in the part polished, once pounded rice, but was it essential to health?

('66', 311, 0, 1, 550774) 312 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 311, 1, 2, 550816) [G.] If you can prove that it is not essential to health, I shall readily capitulate.
('66', 311, 2, 3, 550902) But the problem of food does not simply consist in the calculation of vitamins and proteins.
('66', 311, 2, 4, 550995) Biological experiments must also be made, and it is those experiments that should finally determine the matter.
('66', 311, 2, 5, 551107) It is for you to make those biological experiments.
('66', 311, 2, 6, 551159) Don’t say off hand that Bengalis need half a pound of rice every day and must digest half a pound.
('66', 311, 2, 7, 551258) Devise a scientifically perfect diet for them.
('66', 311, 2, 8, 551305) Determine the quantity of starch required for an average human constitution.
('66', 311, 2, 9, 551382) I would not be satisfied until I have been able to add some milk and milk fat and greens to the diet of our common village folk, and I want chemists who would starve in order to find an ideal diet for their poor countrymen.
('66', 311, 2, 10, 551606) Unfortunately for us, our doctors have never approached the question from the humanitarian standpoint, at any rate from the poor man’s standpoint.
('66', 311, 3, 11, 551753) The upshot of the discussion was the decision to suspend the issue of certificates and cancel the ones already issued, so far as unpolished rice is concerned, and the members were urged to carry on further inquiry and research, in order to place the matter beyond a shadow of doubt.

('66', 311, 5, 14, 552097) Unrevised March 18, 1935
('66', 311, 6, 15, 552122) MANILAL AND SUSHILA, You have given a good description of the agent.
('66', 311, 6, 16, 552191) I am able to form an idea.
('66', 311, 6, 17, 552218) You should write “Saiyed Sahib” and not just “Saiyed”.
('66', 311, 6, 18, 552273) I do not want to annoy you by persistently criticizing you.
('66', 311, 6, 19, 552333) I trust that you would do nothing with deliberate malice but I also know that you could be led astray or provoked into saying or writing thoughtless words.
('66', 311, 6, 20, 552489) Moreover you do allow your opinions to be based on unconfirmed reports.
('66', 311, 6, 21, 552561) But it is difficult to change your habit forthwith.
('66', 311, 6, 22, 552613) Yes, if you regularly pray as in the ashram and recite Chapter XII [of the Gita] which both of you were made to memorize before your marriage and if you meditate on all this, your heart will soften without any effort and your words will be full of humility, love and truth.
('66', 311, 6, 23, 552887) Then you will not sit in judgment upon what others do.
('66', 311, 6, 24, 552942) You will rather examine your own conduct.
('66', 311, 6, 25, 552984) God has not equipped us very fully with the faculty of judging others.
('66', 311, 6, 26, 553055) Who has been able to

('66', 312, 1, 3, 553227) That is why the sages have said that we should never sit in judgment over others.
('66', 312, 1, 4, 553309) We will have done our duty if we can weigh our own deeds dispassionately.
('66', 312, 1, 5, 553383) The maxim that if we are good, the whole world is good is but a corollary of this statement.
('66', 312, 1, 6, 553476) I have no time to write about other things.
('66', 312, 1, 7, 553520) I will definitely send for Aruna khadi woven from yarn spun by me.
('66', 312, 1, 8, 553587) But I am afraid you may not get it in time.

('66', 312, 5, 12, 553728) March 18, 1935
('66', 312, 6, 13, 553743) BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
('66', 312, 7, 14, 553761) It is difficult to advise.
('66', 312, 7, 15, 553788) Ballubhai seems to have committed himself to some extent.
('66', 312, 7, 16, 553846) If he has agreed to have prayers, why should he object to distribution of sweets?
('66', 312, 7, 17, 553928) Are the conditions for free grants the same as for grants in aid?
('66', 312, 7, 18, 553994) The Government’s demand makes no distinction between the two.
('66', 312, 7, 19, 554056) Be that as it may, Ballubhai should now consult friends.
('66', 312, 7, 20, 554113) If they are all firm, they should send a reply to this effect: “The people’s fight against the Government has not stopped.
('66', 312, 7, 21, 554236) It is not a private individual’s birthday, but a king’s reign which is being celebrated.
('66', 312, 7, 22, 554325) The Government, therefore, would be rewarding hypocrisy on our part if we joined in the celebration of a rule which we denounce.
('66', 312, 7, 23, 554454) Since civil disobedience has been suspended, the Government may issue any orders it likes and get them obeyed, but most people will do nothing willingly.
('66', 312, 7, 24, 554608) It would hardly be proper for the Government to force the people to participate in such celebrations against their will.
('66', 312, 7, 25, 554729) As far as possible, we don’t wish to hurt anybody’s feelings.
('66', 312, 7, 26, 554791) The Government, therefore, should not force us to do so.
('66', 312, 7, 27, 554848) We, on our part, will not start an agitation.
('66', 312, 7, 28, 554894) Those who wish to join the celebrations will be free to do so.
('66', 312, 7, 29, 554957) The Government should not write to the Municipality asking it do anything, and the Municipality would write nothing to the Government nor pass any resolution.”
('66', 313, 0, 1, 555117) 314 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 313, 1, 2, 555159) I think that, even if the Government offers some special facilities to the Municipality on this occasion, the latter cannot participate in the celebrations.
('66', 313, 1, 3, 555316) As for the larger question, Ballubhai ought not to raise it.
('66', 313, 1, 4, 555377) This is only my general view.
('66', 313, 1, 5, 555407) If the circumstances in Ahmedabad require a different policy, of course I can’t judge about it.
('66', 313, 1, 6, 555503) You may now advise Ballubhai as you think fit.

('66', 313, 8, 15, 555777) I require two lacs but I also understand the circumstances.
('66', 313, 8, 16, 555837) Jamnalalji too is insistent.
('66', 313, 8, 17, 555866) How can I resist so much love?
('66', 313, 8, 18, 555897) God willing I shall reach on the 20th.
('66', 313, 8, 19, 555936) Please do your best to collect the amount.
('66', 313, 8, 20, 555979) Leave out all pomp and show.
('66', 313, 8, 21, 556008) Do this work as a religious duty.
('66', 313, 8, 22, 556042) Send me a copy of the rules and regulations of the Sammelan, past addresses and the history of the Sammelan, etc.

('66', 314, 3, 4, 556508) CHI AMBUJAM 1,
('66', 314, 4, 5, 556523) You are right.
('66', 314, 4, 6, 556538) I have been too busy to write, though you have always been in my thoughts.
('66', 314, 4, 7, 556613) I have a huge parcel of delicacies.
('66', 314, 4, 8, 556649) Honey and fruit alone may be sent.
('66', 314, 4, 9, 556684) What is the use of your sending papar, murabba, etc.
('66', 314, 4, 10, 556737) And as you know I get enough fruit locally.
('66', 314, 4, 11, 556781) Therefore learn to save every pice.
('66', 314, 4, 12, 556817) Put it by and send the savings to me for the poor.
('66', 314, 4, 13, 556868) If there is anything I want, I shall surely ask for it.
('66', 314, 4, 14, 556924) Just now I am taking raw milk, raw leaves, honey, fresh tamarind and oranges.
('66', 314, 4, 15, 557002) My weight last week was 108 lb.
('66', 314, 4, 16, 557034) Amtul is in Delhi with Devdas.
('66', 314, 4, 17, 557065) Gomtibehn is here.

('66', 314, 4, 20, 557169) Your yarn was quite good.

('66', 314, 4, 22, 557254) You can do service there as well as anywhere else.
('66', 314, 4, 23, 557305) You have Hindi, khadi and other village industries.
('66', 314, 4, 24, 557357) I know Kengheri Ashram.
('66', 314, 4, 25, 557381) Do you interest K. in such things?
('66', 314, 4, 26, 557416) We had many sisters here for the A. I. V. I. A. meeting.
('66', 314, 4, 27, 557473) Now we have Rajkumari Amrit Kaur.
('66', 314, 4, 28, 557507) I have accepted the invitation to preside at the Hindi Sammelan on April 20th.
('66', 314, 4, 29, 557586) There will be at the same time a Mahila Sammelan.
('66', 314, 4, 30, 557636) You should come if you can.
('66', 314, 4, 31, 557664) You can bring K. with you, if he will come.

('66', 315, 2, 3, 557926) WARDHA, March 19, 1935
('66', 315, 3, 4, 557949) MY DEAR SHANKERLAL,
('66', 315, 4, 5, 557969) I have already handed to you Messrs Kirloskar Bros.
('66', 315, 4, 6, 558021) letter of 14th instant addressed to me.
('66', 315, 4, 7, 558061) I commend their letter to the earnest attention of the examiners.
('66', 315, 4, 8, 558127) As Messrs Kirloskar Bros.
('66', 315, 4, 9, 558153) have permitted me to give my own opinion, 1 do so for the guidance of the examiners.
('66', 315, 4, 10, 558238) The numbers against the following paragraphs refer to those in their letter.
('66', 315, 4, 11, 558315) (2) The trial at Wardha is not yet complete.
('66', 315, 4, 12, 558360) In so far as it has gone, I can say that a capable worker did succeed once or twice in spinning over 8,000 yards in 4 hours.
('66', 315, 4, 13, 558485) There never has yet been an output of 16,000 in eight hours at Wardha.
('66', 315, 4, 14, 558556) No woman has worked at it for eight hours at a stretch here.
('66', 315, 4, 15, 558617) My trial of it is still proceeding.
('66', 315, 4, 16, 558653) I should like to try it for six months before pronouncing an opinion onits average capacity.
('66', 315, 4, 17, 558746) But if the examiners are satisfied on this point, absence of a conclusive opinion from me need not in any way delay or otherwise affect the examiners’ award.
('66', 315, 4, 18, 558904) (5) I am unable to subscribe to the opinion that the machine “has fulfilled all the important and major conditions of the competition”.
('66', 315, 4, 19, 559040) I have up to now only applied myself to two conditions, viz., 1st and 4th.
('66', 315, 4, 20, 559115) I do not regard the 1st condition as to handiness as a minor one.
('66', 315, 4, 21, 559181) Indeed it is in my opinion the one unalterable condition.
('66', 315, 4, 22, 559239) Without that condition, there would surely be no difficulty in producing a machine that would give more than 16,000 yards in 8 hours.
('66', 315, 4, 23, 559373) Handiness has to be proved with reference to the crores of cottages scattered in 700,000 villages of India.
('66', 315, 4, 24, 559481) Accepting Webster’s definition of ‘convenient’, a mere look at the machine would convince one who has any knowledge of Indian cottages and conditions that the machine cannot be called handy in any shape or form.
('66', 315, 4, 25, 559693) For an Indian cottage it is without doubt a cumbersome piece of machinery.
('66', 315, 4, 26, 559768) As to conditions 5 and 6, I am wholly incompetent to pronounce an opinion.
('66', 315, 4, 27, 559843) As to condition 2, it is yet too early for me to pronounce an opinion.
('66', 315, 4, 28, 559914) I understand from Shri Kale as also from the machine of the

('66', 316, 1, 2, 560021) firm who were good enough to visit me that the machine is not capable of being reduced in size any further than it is already.
('66', 316, 1, 3, 560148) I am quite satisfied that the machine cannot be accommodated in an Indian cottage of the average size.
('66', 316, 1, 4, 560251) The firm’s suggestion that cottages should be specially built in order to house the machine is too unpractical to need refutation.
('66', 316, 1, 5, 560382) In my opinion, therefore, the machine does not satisfy what to me is one of the vital conditions of the prize.
('66', 316, 1, 6, 560493) But it may not be considered as more than the evidence of a witness before the judges.

('66', 316, 8, 17, 560967) I was tempted to add a paragraph about the lower use which in my discussion with you I showed could be made of the machine.

('66', 317, 2, 3, 561451) March 19, 1935
('66', 317, 3, 4, 561466) PANDITJI, I got your letter.
('66', 317, 3, 5, 561495) I was waiting for it.
('66', 317, 3, 6, 561517) Do whatever you can for Rambhau.
('66', 317, 3, 7, 561550) Do not be angry.
('66', 317, 3, 8, 561567) Conciliate Mridulabehn.
('66', 317, 3, 9, 561591) I had a very good letter from her.
('66', 317, 3, 10, 561626) I do appreciate that you have started cooking separately.
('66', 317, 3, 11, 561684) Teach Rambhau to cook also.

('66', 317, 8, 16, 561825) NARAHARI, I have your letter.
('66', 317, 8, 17, 561855) I have already heard something about Neelmani.
('66', 317, 8, 18, 561902) I shall know something more from Bhagwanji.
('66', 317, 8, 19, 561946) I am afraid such things will go on happening and we have to overcome them as best we can.
('66', 317, 8, 20, 562036) It is no doubt good to remove all young men without exception.
('66', 317, 8, 21, 562099) Our safety lies only in young girls and responsible men remaining.
('66', 317, 8, 22, 562166) Bhagwanji will compete his thirty five days there.

('66', 318, 6, 9, 562865) DEAR DR.
('66', 318, 6, 10, 562874) GODBOLE,
('66', 318, 7, 11, 562883) I thank you for your letter enclosing your valuable note on the comparative merit of cow butter fat and buffalo butter fat.
('66', 318, 7, 12, 563007) The carefulness with which you are approaching this question tempts me to put further questions.
('66', 318, 7, 13, 563104) I am using tamarind as part of food, of course in measured quantities, for those who are suffering from constipation and who are on uncooked green leaves such as methi, chakvat and the like.
('66', 318, 7, 14, 563295) The popular belief in these parts, however, seems to be that tamarind produces boils and induces rheumatism.
('66', 318, 7, 15, 563404) Is there any warrant for these beliefs?
('66', 318, 7, 16, 563444) Can you also tell me what leaves are edible in an uncooked state?
('66', 318, 7, 17, 563510) I am using just now the bhajis one gets in the market including cabbage, cauliflower, in an uncooked state.
('66', 318, 7, 18, 563618) One thing more.
('66', 318, 7, 19, 563634) If you are following the pages of Harijan, you must have noticed the opinion I have published on unpolished rice.
('66', 318, 7, 20, 563748) 2 It seems that there is no such thing as whole unpolished rice to be had in the market.
('66', 318, 7, 21, 563837) I had difficulty in procuring whole unpolished rice.
('66', 318, 7, 22, 563890) And I am now grinding my own paddy and have now whole unpolished rice.
('66', 318, 7, 23, 563961) Chemists, however, say that there is no proof to show that whole unpolished rice is meant by those who have given their opinion in its favour.
('66', 318, 7, 24, 564104) I have, however, contended that in a matter of such importance medical men who have given me their considered opinion could not have used the expression ‘unpolished rice, in a loose unscientific manner.
('66', 318, 7, 25, 564307) There can be degrees of polished rice but surely not of unpolished.
('66', 318, 7, 26, 564375) They contend that it is highly likely that the pericarp which even a slight polishing removes, is unnecessary for the system if

('66', 319, 1, 3, 564671) Of course they admit that they have no authority for their statement.
('66', 319, 1, 4, 564741) They simply say that the testimony in favour of unpolished rice has reference only to the partly polished, hand pounded bazaar rice which passes as unpolished.
('66', 319, 1, 5, 564901) Can you throw any light on this controversy?
('66', 319, 1, 6, 564946) Is the pericarp of rice lndigestible?
('66', 319, 1, 7, 564984) Is it harmful to the system?
('66', 319, 1, 8, 565013) Can it be that this matter has escaped investigation up till now?

('66', 319, 6, 15, 565229) MY DEAR KRISHNADAS, I have your letter.
('66', 319, 6, 16, 565269) I think it is worth while incurring the air mail expense if we incur any expense at all in sending the weekly letter.
('66', 319, 6, 17, 565387) I think that it is a good thing to send the weekly letter.
('66', 319, 6, 18, 565446) Edith Hunter is a fine worker.
('66', 319, 6, 19, 565477) She is the soul of the Society.

('66', 319, 6, 22, 565572) You have drawn a full and pathetic picture of Satisbabu’s life.
('66', 319, 6, 23, 565636) I am quite clear in my mind that there is nothing to be done.
('66', 319, 6, 24, 565698) There are men enough to take loving care of him in Benares.
('66', 319, 6, 25, 565758) But he must be allowed to live out his life in the manner he likes best.
('66', 319, 6, 26, 565831) After all God concerns Himself about the tiniest life.
('66', 319, 6, 27, 565886) How much more so about those who are conscious of His power as also His benevolence.

('66', 320, 1, 3, 566335) I hope you are now completely restored.
('66', 320, 1, 4, 566375) We cannot be party to prosecution against Harijans who indulge in marriages in breach of the Sarda Act.
('66', 320, 1, 5, 566479) It is a reform which Harijans must tackle for themselves.
('66', 320, 1, 6, 566537) We have no right to undertake prosecution until savarna Hindus have proved themselves abovereproach in this matter and until there is no distinction between savarnas and avarnas.
('66', 320, 1, 7, 566716) What is this complaint about a separate silk store being conducted under your patronage and supervision and by a man discharged by the A. I. S. A.?
('66', 320, 1, 8, 566864) There is a long complaint made by three writers from Sialkot.

('66', 320, 7, 18, 567180) Now today the time has come for giving you some trouble.
('66', 320, 7, 19, 567237) A Harijan who is a favourite of Mama and whom Mama gives first rank in integrity and who shares half of your name—being called Haribhai—seems to have become your neighbour to satisfy your wishes.
('66', 320, 7, 20, 567433) He is building a house under your inspiration.
('66', 320, 7, 21, 567480) Now all this is beyond my comprehension.
('66', 320, 7, 22, 567521) Leave aside Harijans.
('66', 320, 7, 23, 567543) How many men of such integrity have we among non Harijan workers?
('66', 320, 7, 24, 567609) When there is such a shortage of workers why did you choose to bury such a worker as Haribhai by getting him build a house in Sachin?
('66', 320, 7, 25, 567743) Mama has asked me to help him.
('66', 320, 7, 26, 567774) Solve my problem to my satisfaction; and only after that the question of assistance can be thought of.

('66', 323, 2, 3, 570552) [Before March 22, 1935] 2
('66', 323, 3, 4, 570578) A missionary friend who was on a visit to us asked Gandhiji what was the most effective way of preaching the gospel of Christ, for that was his mission.
('66', 323, 3, 5, 570731) [GANDHIJI:] To live the gospel is the most effective way— most effective in the beginning, in the middle and in the end.
('66', 323, 3, 6, 570852) Preaching jars on me and makes no appeal to me, and I get suspicious of missionaries who preach.
('66', 323, 3, 7, 570949) But I love those who never preach but live the life according to their lights.
('66', 323, 3, 8, 571028) Their lives are silent yet most effective testimonies.
('66', 323, 3, 9, 571083) Therefore I cannot say what to preach, but I can say that a life of service and uttermost simplicity is the best preaching.
('66', 323, 3, 10, 571207) If, therefore, you go on serving people and ask them also to serve, they would understand.
('66', 323, 3, 11, 571298) But you quote instead John 3, 16 and ask them to believe it.
('66', 323, 3, 12, 571359) That has no appeal to me, and I am sure people will not understand it.
('66', 323, 3, 13, 571430) Where there has been acceptance of the gospel through preaching, my complaint is that there has been some motive.
('66', 323, 4, 14, 571544) [Q.] But we also see it and we try our best to guard against it.
('66', 323, 4, 15, 571609) [A.] But you can’t guard against it.
('66', 323, 4, 16, 571646) One sordid motive vitiates the whole preaching.
('66', 323, 4, 17, 571694) It is like a drop of poison which fouls the whole food.
('66', 323, 4, 18, 571750) Therefore I should do without any preaching at all.
('66', 323, 4, 19, 571802) A rose does not need to preach.
('66', 323, 4, 20, 571834) It simply spreads its fragrance.
('66', 323, 4, 21, 571867) The fragrance is its own sermon.
('66', 323, 4, 22, 571900) If it had human understanding and if it could engage a number of preachers’ the preachers would not be able to sell more roses than the fragrance itself could do.
('66', 323, 4, 23, 572063) The fragrance of religious and spiritual life is much finer and subtler than that of the rose.

('66', 323, 6, 26, 572298) 2 Gandhiji commenced his four week silence on March 22. The interview, therefore, must have taken place before that date.
('66', 323, 6, 27, 572420) 3 Mahadev Desai says: “But all this apparently failed to be of effect and the reverend gentleman retired with the imprecation, .
('66', 323, 6, 28, 572549) ‘Mr. Gandhi .

('66', 324, 3, 4, 572792) Q. When you concentrate on the health and welfare of the villages, are you going in for medical relief to any extent?
('66', 324, 4, 5, 572910) GANDHIJI: We are not going in for medical relief but for prevention.
('66', 324, 4, 6, 572979) Therefore we concentrate on sanitation and hygiene.
('66', 324, 4, 7, 573031) I am of opinion that a good deal of medical help is given ‘only in order to make people more helpless.
('66', 324, 4, 8, 573134) Medical help, in most cases, is practically thrown at them, and so it is lost on them.
('66', 324, 4, 9, 573221) Some of my co workers are going to a village close by where the streets are covered with filth.
('66', 324, 4, 10, 573317) No wonder if the eyes of the children there are bad and there are all kinds of diseases.
('66', 324, 4, 11, 573406) Just now our workers’ efforts do not seem to make any impression on the villagers; but when they find that, as a result of their village having become cleaner and free from filth, they are also comparatively free from disease, they will appreciate the difference.
('66', 324, 4, 12, 573670) Now, if you had a free dispensary there and were giving doses of medicine to all that came, you would make no headway.
('66', 324, 4, 13, 573789) Tackling the village sanitation is the only really substantial work.
('66', 324, 4, 14, 573858) There is an evil at our doors which is perfectly preventible, and yet we have suffered our villagers to tolerate it for scores of years.
('66', 324, 4, 15, 573995) It is an uphill task, whilst the distribution of free medicines is much easier.
('66', 324, 4, 16, 574075) But I am asking my co workers to avoid the easy thing and cheap applause.
('66', 324, 4, 17, 574149) We must first concentrate on the prevention of disease, we can tackle the disease itself later on.
('66', 324, 5, 18, 574248) Q. Then you won’t have doctors?
('66', 324, 6, 19, 574280) A. No, if you will not misunderstand me.
('66', 324, 6, 20, 574321) I have done medical relief work myself.
('66', 324, 6, 21, 574361) Only last month Harijans in Kathia war were given free medical relief by doctors, who performed operations for cataract and other diseases of the eyes.
('66', 324, 6, 22, 574513) But I am just now talking of measures for the preservation of general health, and even when my workers have achieved the preliminary task of cleaning the villages, I should equip them with just four things— quinine, castor oil, bicarbonate of soda and iodine.
('66', 324, 6, 23, 574773) No fifth thing is necessary.
('66', 324, 7, 24, 574802) Q. You seem to give the last place in your programme to schools?
('66', 324, 8, 25, 574867) 1 Extracted from Mahadev Desai’s report of the interview published in Harijan under the title “The Most Effective Way”.
('66', 324, 8, 26, 574987) The missionary ladies had come from Nagpur.
('66', 324, 8, 27, 575031) 2 Vide the preceding item.
('66', 325, 0, 1, 575058) 326 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 325, 1, 2, 575100) We are conducting numerous schools for Harijans and giving numerous scholarships to Harijan boys.
('66', 325, 1, 3, 575198) What is the use of my adding the school programme to the work of the Industries Association?
('66', 325, 1, 4, 575291) It is intended to supplement the work of the Harijan Sangh and the Spinners’ Association.
('66', 325, 1, 5, 575381) This last has a capital of Rs. 20 lakhs to operate upon, and the Harijan Sangh has also a fair amount of funds.
('66', 325, 1, 6, 575493) I must now launch a campaign, I said to myself, which needs very little funds and which adds to the pockets of the poor.
('66', 325, 1, 7, 575614) Thus, if I could simply ask the villagers not to waste the human manure but to turn it to good account, I should, without any capital outlay, help them to save Rs. 50 crores every year.
('66', 325, 1, 8, 575800) This turning of human evacuations to rich manure by superficial burial I learnt from Dr. Poore, and it is the simplest and the most effective method, whereas the activated sludge plan and the septic tank are comparatively expensive things.
('66', 325, 2, 9, 576040) Q. Does your Harijan Sangh do anything for the spiritual welfare of the people?
('66', 325, 3, 10, 576120) A. With me, moral includes spiritual, and so my answer to your question will be ‘everything, and ‘nothing’.
('66', 325, 3, 11, 576228) Nothing, because we have no department to look after their spiritual welfare.
('66', 325, 3, 12, 576306) Everything, because we expect the personal touch of the workers to transform the men among whom they are working.
('66', 325, 3, 13, 576420) Even as it is, we are caught in the coil of hypocrisy; but when you set apart a department for the work, you make the thing doubly difficult.
('66', 325, 3, 14, 576562) In my career as a reformer I have regarded everything from the moral standpoint.
('66', 325, 3, 15, 576643) Whether I am engaged in tackling a political question or a social or economic one, the moral side of it always obtrudes itself and it pervades my whole attitude.
('66', 325, 3, 16, 576805) But I admit I have no special department to look after the Harijans’ spiritual welfare.
('66', 325, 4, 17, 576893) Q. But we, Christians, feel that we, who have something to share, must share it with others.
('66', 325, 4, 18, 576986) If we want consolation, we find it from the Bible.
('66', 325, 4, 19, 577037) Now, as for the Harijans, who have no solace to get from Hinduism, how are we to meet their spiritual needs?
('66', 325, 5, 20, 577146) A. By behaving just like the rose.
('66', 325, 5, 21, 577181) Does the rose proclaim itself, or is it self propagated?
('66', 325, 5, 22, 577238) Has it an army of missionaries proclaiming its beauties?
('66', 325, 6, 23, 577295) Q. But supposing someone asked us, ‘Where did you get the scent?’
('66', 325, 7, 24, 577361) A. The rose, if it had sense and speech, would say, ‘Fool, don’t you see that I got it from my Maker?’
('66', 325, 8, 25, 577464) Q. But if someone asks you, ‘Then, is there no book?’
('66', 326, 0, 1, 577518) VOL. 66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 327
('66', 326, 1, 2, 577565) A. You will then say, ‘Yes, for me there is the Bible.’ If they were to ask me, I would present to some the Koran, to some the Gita, to some the Bible and to some Tulsidas’s Ramayana.
('66', 326, 1, 3, 577749) I am like a wise doctor prescribing what is necessary for each patient.
('66', 326, 2, 4, 577821) Q. But I find difficulty in getting much from the Gita.
('66', 326, 3, 5, 577877) A. You may, but I do not find any difficulty in getting much from the Bible as well as from the Koran.

('66', 326, 6, 8, 578032) [Before March 22, 1935] 1
('66', 326, 7, 9, 578058) DEAR MADELEINE,
('66', 326, 8, 10, 578074) I have just read your letter to Pyarelal.
('66', 326, 8, 11, 578116) Thank God I am about to observe complete silence, thus I can reply to your letter immediately.
('66', 326, 8, 12, 578211) Yes, I ought to write a complete letter in reply to the long letter of the Sage 2. But the very adjective “complete” frightens me.
('66', 326, 8, 13, 578342) I have no time to compose a letter which will do sufficient justice to this letter from there.
('66', 326, 8, 14, 578437) I must try to do it during my days of silence.
('66', 326, 8, 15, 578484) Your question is simple.
('66', 326, 8, 16, 578509) My opposition is to socialism as it is interpreted here in its official programme.
('66', 326, 8, 17, 578592) I can have nothing to say against the theory or the philosophy of socialism.
('66', 326, 8, 18, 578669) The programme as it is put here cannot be achieved without violence.
('66', 326, 8, 19, 578738) The socialists here do not exclude violence under all circumstances whatsoever.
('66', 326, 8, 20, 578818) They would take to arms openly if they saw there was a chance to usurp power by it.
('66', 326, 8, 21, 578902) There are in the programme some details into which I need not enter.
('66', 326, 8, 22, 578971) I wonder if this reply will answer your difficulties.
('66', 326, 8, 23, 579025) However, you must write about your difficulties more concretely.
('66', 326, 8, 24, 579090) Love to you both.
('66', 326, 10, 25, 579108) From a copy: C.W. 9737. Courtesy: R. K. Prabhu
('66', 326, 11, 26, 579155) 1 The source has “March 28”.
('66', 326, 11, 27, 579184) However it is clear from the text that the letter was written before Gandhiji had started his silence, which he did on March 22. 2 Romain Rolland

('66', 327, 2, 3, 579383) DEPLORING ‘CONVERSIONS’
('66', 327, 3, 4, 579407) A Harijan sevak in Devakottah writes deploring the so called conversions to Christianity of Harijans in that locality.
('66', 327, 3, 5, 579526) The public know how they are systematically persecuted by the Nattars.
('66', 327, 3, 6, 579597) If, afflicted by the persecution and losing hope of ever receiving help from the other savarna Hindus, the poor Harijans seek shelter in Christianity, we may not be surprised.
('66', 327, 3, 7, 579773) And our grief is worse than useless if we cannot turn it into powerful energy.
('66', 327, 3, 8, 579852) Conversion under the stress of physical discomfort is no spiritual conversion.
('66', 327, 3, 9, 579931) But we may not grumble if Harijans change their faith in order to better their material condition and to secure protection from persecution.
('66', 327, 3, 10, 580072) What we need deplore is the cause of conversion.
('66', 327, 3, 11, 580121) Let us realize and own that savarna Hindus are the cause.
('66', 327, 3, 12, 580179) If the savarna Hindus of Devakottah were alive to a sense of duty by the Harijans of their locality the Nattars, who are themselves savarna Hindus, would not dare persecute Harijans as if the latter were not members of the same human family as the former.
('66', 327, 3, 13, 580435) The correspondent suggests that some persons from outside Devakottah might go and work among the Nattars and the Harijans.
('66', 327, 3, 14, 580558) It would be good if this happened.
('66', 327, 3, 15, 580593) But I doubt if ever substantial results will be obtained by stray outsiders going there temporarily.
('66', 327, 3, 16, 580694) Any such effort must be vain, as will be that of doctors going among and seeking to cure patients who would not help themselves with the medicines prescribed for them.
('66', 327, 3, 17, 580862) Both the wings of the savarna Hindus, those who stand aloof and the Nattar savarna Hindus, are suffering from illnesses, the latter from hankering after the persecution of their fellows, and the former from criminal apathy.
('66', 327, 3, 18, 581086) Outsiders can at best go among them, diagnose the disease and prescribe the remedy.
('66', 327, 3, 19, 581170) It is for the patients to adopt the remedy.
('66', 327, 3, 20, 581214) The young savarnas of Devakottah know the cause and the remedy.
('66', 327, 3, 21, 581278) Will they apply it?
('66', 327, 3, 22, 581298) Thakkar Bapa is in their midst or will be presently.
('66', 327, 3, 23, 581351) Will they listen to his advice?
('66', 327, 3, 24, 581383) Conversions are but one small result of the disease.
('66', 327, 3, 25, 581436) Remove the cause, and the conversions will cease, as also many worse results.
('66', 327, 4, 26, 581514) ‘TAKLI’ FOR VILLAGE WORKERS
('66', 327, 5, 27, 581542) I would request the several workers in various parts of India who
('66', 328, 0, 1, 581608) VOL. 66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 329
('66', 328, 1, 2, 581655) have been seeking to deliver the message of self reliance in the matter of cloth in villages, to pay their attention to the potentialities of the takli as a means of spinning.
('66', 328, 1, 3, 581831) This subject has been referred to previously in these columns some time back, and it deserves to be studied with great attention.
('66', 328, 1, 4, 581961) It has been demonstrated by the inmates of the Satyagraha Ashram and sister institutions of Wardha that for an average spinner the productive capacity of the takli, if rightly handled, is equal to that of the charkha in every respect.
('66', 328, 1, 5, 582196) For a person who is not altogether weak and who wants to spin only during leisure hours, and not with a view to remuneration, the takli is capable of completely replacing the charkha.
('66', 328, 1, 6, 582380) The workers should, therefore, learn the new method of plying the takli, and introduce it in the villages in preference to the charkha.
('66', 328, 1, 7, 582516) For the aged and the weak the charkha would still be necessary.
('66', 328, 1, 8, 582580) For, the charkha, according to the principles of mechanics, is but a takli worked by a system of levers.
('66', 328, 1, 9, 582685) And as one whose muscles are not strong enough to lift up a weight by hand would need the help of a lever to do so, so one who cannot give the necessary momentum to the takli by the muscles of his palm, or cannot bear the strain of constantly raising and lowering the arm, would need the charkha.
('66', 328, 2, 10, 582982) A WORKER’S PILGRIMAGE
('66', 328, 3, 11, 583004) Shri Sitarama Sastry has been organizing what may be called pilgrimages of workers who convey the message of village service, among their surroundings.
('66', 328, 3, 12, 583156) He sends me a brief report of the second pilgrimage from which I take the following:
('66', 328, 4, 13, 583241) The second ‘march, commenced on the morning of the 17th February and ended in the evening of the 4th March.
('66', 328, 4, 14, 583349) The party consisted of 8 men led by Srijut N. Venkatachellapaty and Ramineni Appayya.
('66', 328, 4, 15, 583435) Two worked for 4 days, one for 11 days, and the other 5 worked continuously.
('66', 328, 5, 16, 583512) They visited 13 villages in the Bapatla 1 taluq, one village in Tenali 2
('66', 328, 6, 17, 583585) taluq, and another in Repalle taluq, in all 15 places.
('66', 328, 6, 18, 583640) They travelled by rail, motor, country carts and on foot; and the distance covered by them is 75 miles.
('66', 328, 7, 19, 583744) They delivered lectures in 4 villages with the aid of the magic lantern and gave gramophone performances in 5 villages.

('66', 329, 10, 12, 584198) Razors were made in Cherukumpalem, Ongole 1 taluq, and the tailam and shoes and sandals were made in the Vinayasramam.
('66', 329, 10, 13, 584317) The sales commanded in this ‘march’ were greater than those in the first ‘march’.
('66', 329, 10, 14, 584399) The expenses incurred come to Rs. 36 3 3.
('66', 329, 11, 15, 584441) This is a step in the right direction.
('66', 329, 11, 16, 584480) I would suggest that the pilgrims should avoid all travelling by rail, motor, or even village carts.
('66', 329, 11, 17, 584581) If they will adopt my advice, they will observe that their work will be more effective and that the expenses will be practically nil.
('66', 329, 11, 18, 584715) No more than two or three should form a party.
('66', 329, 11, 19, 584762) I would expect villagers to house and feed the parties.
('66', 329, 11, 20, 584818) Small parties will be no tax on the resources of villagers, as large ones are likely to be.
('66', 329, 11, 21, 584910) The work of the parties should be more in the nature of sanitary service, survey of village conditions and instruction of the villagers as to what they can do without much, if any, outlay of money to improve their health and economic conditions.
('66', 329, 11, 22, 585156) If we seek to make villages self dependent to the utmost extent possible, there is not much scope for sale, in the villages visited, of articles made in other villages, except where it is clear that villagers do not or cannot make such articles in their own villages.
('66', 329, 11, 23, 585424) Village service as conceived by the A. I. V. I. A. has a unique mission.
('66', 329, 11, 24, 585497) Town parties go out to villages to clean, instruct and purchase.
('66', 329, 11, 25, 585562) Parties of villagers can be organized to go to towns to sell articles made in their villages and demonstrate their usefulness.
('66', 329, 11, 26, 585689) This village movement is one of decentralization and restoration of health and comfort and the skill of the artisan to villagers.

('66', 330, 2, 3, 585915) Dr. Profullla Ghosh has been examining the comparative value of cow’s milk ghee and buffalo’s milk ghee.
('66', 330, 2, 4, 586020) He writes: 1
('66', 330, 3, 5, 586033) This opinion is too technical for the lay reader.
('66', 330, 3, 6, 586083) Opinion about the two varieties of ghee is not as decisive as about the two milks.
('66', 330, 3, 7, 586166) This much is, however, clear—that chemical analysis shows no superiority of buffalo ghee over cow ghee.
('66', 330, 3, 8, 586270) It is impossible to support both the animals.
('66', 330, 3, 9, 586316) We have, therefore, to make the choice.
('66', 330, 3, 10, 586356) The balance of opinion, all things considered, lies with the cow which, with proper care and selective breeding, is capable of giving as rich and sweet milk as anyone can desire.

('66', 330, 5, 12, 586554) 478. TEMPLE ENTRY
('66', 330, 6, 13, 586572) Readers of Harijan know that Thakkar Bapa has been touring in the South for the Harijan cause.
('66', 330, 6, 14, 586667) Taking advantage of his presence in Travancore, the workers had arranged a conference at Aranmula, with Thakkar Bapa as President.
('66', 330, 6, 15, 586798) The conference met on the 10th instant and was very largely attended.
('66', 330, 6, 16, 586868) There were present as many Harijans as other caste Hindus.
('66', 330, 6, 17, 586927) An address was presented to Thakkar Bapa on behalf of Harijans.
('66', 330, 6, 18, 586991) It contained this important reference to temple entry:
('66', 330, 7, 19, 587046) It is our deepest conviction that untouchability can and will never die as long as the temple doors are closed against us.
('66', 330, 7, 20, 587169) Temple entry is to us the acid test of success of the Harijan movement.
('66', 330, 7, 21, 587241) All other efforts at our uplift are bound to appear to us insincere so long as temple entry is denied to us.
('66', 330, 7, 22, 587350) We implore you to employ all the strength of the Harijan Sevak Sangh to secure for us temple entry.
('66', 330, 7, 23, 587450) Of course, there is no abolition of untouchability till every public temple is open to every Hindu precisely on the same terms as to the other Hindus.
('66', 330, 7, 24, 587601) A common place of worship is the surest test of a common faith.
('66', 330, 7, 25, 587665) No wonder all other efforts appear as insincere to Harijans.
('66', 330, 7, 26, 587726) But they are not necessarily insincere because they appear so.

('66', 331, 1, 3, 588238) The seed has beensown, never to die.
('66', 331, 1, 4, 588275) It is bound to bear fruit in its own time.
('66', 331, 1, 5, 588318) Seeds of hardy trees take long to sprout.
('66', 331, 1, 6, 588360) None the less they are growing every minute.
('66', 331, 1, 7, 588405) So is the seed of temple entry growing.
('66', 331, 1, 8, 588445) The reformers will not rest till every public temple is open to Harijans.
('66', 331, 1, 9, 588519) All ameliorative measures are steps in the direction of temple entry.
('66', 331, 1, 10, 588589) The Harijan address is a timely reminder to every one of us desiring to serve the cause that we are not to think that the temple entry question is shelved because there is nowadays no mention of it in the Press.
('66', 331, 1, 11, 588801) While they may not carry on a public agitation in the matter, workers should do personal canvassing in their neighbourhood and persuade trustees and temple goers to open the temples within their beat.

('66', 331, 4, 14, 589072) The Pledge 1 was purposely drawn up as it is.
('66', 331, 4, 15, 589118) It is of a general character.
('66', 331, 4, 16, 589148) It is a gentleman’s pledge, each member being put upon his or her honour as to the interpretation of the expression ‘the best part of my energy and talents to the furtherance of its object, which is the all round welfare of villagers of India’.
('66', 331, 4, 17, 589393) Members are also pledged, not only to work for the furtherance of the object, but also ‘to strive to live up to the ideals and prefer the use of village manufactures to any other’.
('66', 331, 4, 18, 589574) The recommending Member of the Board will, therefore, see to it that the candidate for Membership has, in everything he does, welfare of villagers at heart.
('66', 331, 4, 19, 589731) It follows that such a person will give to village work at least some time every day, not necessarily in villages, but may be, for villages.
('66', 331, 4, 20, 589872) Thus, a Member living in a city on a particular day, who sells to or induces a person to buy village manufactures, has done some village work for that day.
('66', 331, 4, 21, 590028) The Member recommending will also see to it that the candidate, wherever possible, uses for himself articles of village manufacture, e.g., khadi in the place of mill cloth, village earthen pots instead of factory made china, reed pen instead of steel pen, hand made paper instead of ordinary paper, wholesome babul, neem or such other twigs

('66', 332, 4, 7, 590955) Maha dev had gone to Calcutta and some correspondence remained un attended to.
('66', 332, 4, 8, 591034) What is the date of the exhibition?
('66', 332, 4, 9, 591070) In any case, if anybody there wants to attain the speed on the takli, he should be sent here for a week.
('66', 332, 4, 10, 591175) Mere demonstration for a day or two in Poona won’t serve the purpose you have in mind.
('66', 332, 4, 11, 591262) What about rice?
('66', 332, 4, 12, 591279) We are preparing unpolished rice ourselves.

('66', 332, 9, 17, 591408) DEAR HUKERIKAR, I think that when Congress village workers are invited, they should go and put their viewpoints at the meeting.
('66', 332, 9, 18, 591536) If there is agreement on any items, we should work in co operation.
('66', 332, 9, 19, 591604) For a true village worker the question of prestige does not come in at all; he does not work in order to acquire influence or prestige.
('66', 332, 9, 20, 591740) He works because he must.
('66', 332, 9, 21, 591766) He cannot help serving the villagers.
('66', 332, 9, 22, 591804) What under certain definite circumstances one should do depends solely upon one’s own judgment based on those circum stances.

('66', 333, 4, 8, 592351) She has been here for four days but I could have a real discussion with her only today.
('66', 333, 4, 9, 592439) I think it would be better if you wrote to Delhi to tell them what is happening on your side.

('66', 333, 4, 11, 592558) I am writing to him.
('66', 333, 4, 12, 592579) It would certainly not be advisable for you to call him to you.

('66', 333, 4, 14, 592712) You will know from it what I do.
('66', 333, 4, 15, 592745) I will not write more today.

('66', 339, 8, 15, 601150) We may disapprove of the present education but that is all that is available to our young people.
('66', 339, 8, 16, 601248) We have not so far presented any substitute before the public or the Harijans.
('66', 339, 8, 17, 601327) Thus we have to grant scholarships till we have a living scheme to offer.
('66', 339, 8, 18, 601401) There is ample scope for improvement in our own schools.

('66', 340, 7, 16, 602313) It is much easier than spinning.
('66', 340, 7, 17, 602346) You must be well versed at least in ginning and carding.

('66', 341, 4, 6, 603129) How can there be no feeling in renting out [the Ashram]?
('66', 341, 4, 7, 603186) Were there no feelings when Harischandra sold himself and his wife?
('66', 341, 4, 8, 603254) It in letting out the Ashram for the sake of Harijans it is not feelings that are respected, then what else is it?
('66', 341, 4, 9, 603369) I was impelled by feelings when I left the Ashram.
('66', 341, 4, 10, 603420) Instead of so many houses getting eaten up by termites and going to ruin, how much nicer it would be if they were rented out and looked after.
('66', 341, 4, 11, 603563) Do you know that the non Harijans who are not Harijan workers now pay rent?
('66', 341, 4, 12, 603639) I hope you do.
('66', 341, 4, 13, 603654) A golden dagger may well adorn the waist, but what if it is thrust into the stomach?
('66', 341, 4, 14, 603739) I would certainly demand rent if any literature pertaining to the Ashram history, etc., is kept within the premises.
('66', 341, 4, 15, 603856) That land is meant for the Harijans.
('66', 341, 4, 16, 603893) If it is put to any other use, the sanctity of it can be preserved only by charging rent.

('66', 341, 10, 24, 604206) We should be content with introducing whatever changes we can in the institutions where our children study.
('66', 341, 10, 25, 604314) That is my intention, but how do I know about the atmosphere there?
('66', 341, 10, 26, 604382) I am not well equipped for taking a definite decision.
('66', 341, 10, 27, 604437) That is why I agreed so readily to accept what Sardar wanted.
('66', 341, 10, 28, 604499) All workers, therefore, should do that if they find that it is practicable.
('66', 341, 10, 29, 604575) You cannot give your time to any activity other than Harijan work.
('66', 341, 10, 30, 604642) The dairy is one of those activities.
('66', 341, 10, 31, 604680) Give Titus Harijan assistants as far as possible.
('66', 341, 10, 32, 604730) Do not rest so long as a good tanneryis not set up there.

('66', 345, 3, 4, 609101) MY DEAR AMRIT,
('66', 345, 4, 5, 609116) You are as good as your word.
('66', 345, 4, 6, 609146) You have given me a wire, a postcard and a good letter.
('66', 345, 4, 7, 609202) Your overlooking Kumarappa’s notice is therefore excused.
('66', 345, 4, 8, 609260) It was not meant for you.
('66', 345, 4, 9, 609286) You were no guest of the Association.
('66', 345, 4, 10, 609324) You came as a member of the family.
('66', 345, 4, 11, 609360) Among the commissions for Shummy please add the medicinal and food value of tamarind if I did not ask you to note it.
('66', 345, 4, 12, 609478) As I am making extensive use of it and as there is a superstition against its use in these parts, I am anxious to have medical opinion as early as possible.
('66', 345, 4, 13, 609635) Heat is daily growing here.
('66', 345, 4, 14, 609663) It does not worry me.

('66', 346, 3, 4, 610405) BHAI THAKKAR BAPA, Do argue with me over Ganesan.
('66', 346, 3, 5, 610455) I can fully convince you.
('66', 346, 3, 6, 610481) I have not given you advice, as you take it, to favour anyone.
('66', 346, 3, 7, 610544) My only consideration was the welfare of the Harijans.
('66', 346, 3, 8, 610599) I believe that it is more advantageous to get work from Ganesan.
('66', 346, 3, 9, 610664) He has no talent for collecting money.
('66', 346, 3, 10, 610703) But he has the talent for work and for looking after people.
('66', 346, 3, 11, 610764) However, all this is useless if he is dishonest.
('66', 346, 3, 12, 610813) The Committee alone will collect the funds, but that pertains to the future.
('66', 346, 3, 13, 610890) Who will pay the past debt?
('66', 346, 3, 14, 610918) If it was on account of Harijan, who has incurred it?
('66', 346, 3, 15, 610972) Will Sastri pay it?
('66', 346, 3, 16, 610992) We shall discuss all this when we meet.
('66', 346, 3, 17, 611032) There will be a Hindi Sammelan in Indore from the 19th to 25th.
('66', 346, 3, 18, 611096) I have to go there.
('66', 346, 3, 19, 611116) If you come there, we shall do something about Harijan and have porridge together.

('66', 346, 7, 22, 611296) SHRIPATRAO, Those who wish to observe brahmacharya should not marry.
('66', 346, 7, 23, 611365) But if a person does wish to marry, he should do so treasuring the thought of brahmacharya in his heart.
('66', 346, 7, 24, 611470) He should then consult the wishes of his wife and observe as much self control as possible.
('66', 346, 7, 25, 611562) The insistence on marrying outside the caste does not mean that one should not consider a girl belonging to the same caste.
('66', 346, 7, 26, 611686) One should marry her if she is most suitable.
('66', 346, 7, 27, 611732) It is natural that one who marries will beget children.
('66', 346, 7, 28, 611788) I had known about Appa.
('66', 346, 7, 29, 611812) Never mind what he has taken away.
('66', 346, 7, 30, 611847) I won’t call it an illmatched marriage if a thirty five year old man marries a girl of twenty five.
('66', 346, 7, 31, 611947) This answers all your questions, doesn’t it?

('66', 347, 4, 5, 612230) I read your letter to Mahadev.
('66', 347, 4, 6, 612261) We have to devote four columns to the Charkha Sangh.
('66', 347, 4, 7, 612314) I have written to Shankerlal about this, saying that he should either secure a certain number of subscribers or pay a certain sum.
('66', 347, 4, 8, 612445) We should guarantee the columns but must not immediately raise the number of columns in the paper.
('66', 347, 4, 9, 612544) Many items we publish are much too lengthy.
('66', 347, 4, 10, 612588) The expansion should come about as we go along.

('66', 347, 9, 16, 612782) BHAI RAJENDRA PRASAD,
('66', 347, 10, 17, 612804) The Bengal affair today is the most tangled and shameful one.
('66', 347, 10, 18, 612866) Nothing can be accomplished by our forming a committee.
('66', 347, 10, 19, 612922) None of the leaders of Bengal will co operate in this and who will listen to other workers?
('66', 347, 10, 20, 613014) Yet I feel that we ought to observe an all India day.
('66', 347, 10, 21, 613068) Other things can be considered when the report from Calcutta comes in.
('66', 347, 10, 22, 613139) We can do nothing in Ceylon.
('66', 347, 10, 23, 613168) Whatever is done there is only through the Government.
('66', 347, 10, 24, 613223) Poor Jayaramdas does his little bit but I do not see anything more being done.
('66', 347, 10, 25, 613302) If you can catch hold of a doctor there, do send him.
('66', 347, 10, 26, 613356) I tried to send Bhaskar, but he is unable to leave.

('66', 348, 4, 6, 613633) My present mood is such that I do not command even children.
('66', 348, 4, 7, 613694) If I could form a judgment, I would even give orders but I find it impossible day by day to judge what would be best for others.
('66', 348, 4, 8, 613823) For the present you may stay on there.
('66', 348, 4, 9, 613862) The hunt for the book is going on.
('66', 348, 4, 10, 613897) This is all part of the economy.
('66', 348, 4, 11, 613930) But I may say that if you are both so inclined you are at liberty to come here.
('66', 348, 4, 12, 614010) You may come also if that place does not suit every one’s health.
('66', 348, 4, 13, 614076) There is no question of your going away once you have come here.
('66', 348, 4, 14, 614141) Going to the West is, of course, another thing.

('66', 351, 12, 15, 618128) NARANDAS,
('66', 351, 13, 16, 618138) April is drawing near.
('66', 351, 13, 17, 618161) I assume that you are still ready to come here.
('66', 351, 13, 18, 618209) I have been discussing the matter with Jamnalalji.
('66', 351, 13, 19, 618260) I discussed it today with Vinoba.
('66', 351, 13, 20, 618294) All three of us are of the view that if you can come without endangering the work which you have been doing there and without hurting Father and Mother, you should come and take charge of the girls’ school.
('66', 351, 13, 21, 618501) The moral responsibility will remain Vinoba’s.
('66', 351, 13, 22, 618548) But running this girls’ ashram is a difficult job.
('66', 351, 13, 23, 618599) It is with great difficulty that we can make up our minds to refuse admission to new applicants.
('66', 351, 13, 24, 618696) All of us believe
('66', 352, 0, 1, 618714) VOL. 66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 353
('66', 352, 1, 2, 618761) that you will be able to do that job well.
('66', 352, 1, 3, 618804) And, moreover, if you are here, you can help me, and also Jamnalal, in a number of small ways.
('66', 352, 1, 4, 618899) Just now Babaji Moghe is in charge.
('66', 352, 1, 5, 618935) Vinoba has entrusted him with this work as a last resort.
('66', 352, 1, 6, 618993) He himself loves village uplift work and had even taken it up.
('66', 352, 1, 7, 619056) But after the Ashram at Sabarmati was disbanded, we were suddenly faced with the necessity of running the girls’ ashram.
('66', 352, 1, 8, 619177) Vinoba, therefore, entrusted Babaji with the job.
('66', 352, 1, 9, 619227) If he can be released from this responsibility, Vinoba wants to use him for village uplift work.
('66', 352, 1, 10, 619324) If you come, I assume that Jamna also will come.
('66', 352, 1, 11, 619373) Purushottam will look after Father and Mother, and he is also doing public work there.
('66', 352, 1, 12, 619460) I also assume, therefore, that he will remain there.
('66', 352, 1, 13, 619513) But if he can come too, I would certainly be happy.

('66', 352, 5, 18, 619698) March 28, 1935
('66', 352, 6, 19, 619713) BHAI SHRI MUNSHI,
('66', 352, 7, 20, 619731) I have not forgotten about your preface.
('66', 352, 7, 21, 619772) Your book is lying in front of me.
('66', 352, 7, 22, 619807) It is for such work alone that I have taken to silence, but so far I have not been able to do it.
('66', 352, 7, 23, 619905) Writing with the left hand takes quite a lot of time, so today I have started writing with the right hand.
('66', 352, 7, 24, 620012) I shall see now how it works.
('66', 352, 7, 25, 620042) My health is no doubt good.
('66', 352, 7, 26, 620070) Quite a lot of Hindi activities are carried on by the A.I.C.C. But who will engage the interest of the members?
('66', 352, 7, 27, 620182) Is all our work carried on in Hindi?
('66', 352, 7, 28, 620219) Do the people from the South and Bengal learn Hindi?
('66', 352, 7, 29, 620272) A script conference will be held at Indore alone with the Sahitya Sammelan.
('66', 352, 7, 30, 620348) Kakasaheb will preside over it.
('66', 352, 7, 31, 620380) Will you be able to go?
('66', 352, 7, 32, 620404) Whether you do so or not please send your suggestions.
('66', 352, 7, 33, 620459) If you can close the mint for six days, both of you must come.
('66', 352, 8, 34, 620522) Blessings from BAPU

('66', 353, 1, 2, 620633) 522. LETTER TO JETHALAL G. SAMPAT
('66', 353, 2, 3, 620667) March 28, 1935
('66', 353, 3, 4, 620682) JETHALAL,
('66', 353, 4, 5, 620692) I have received your detailed letter.
('66', 353, 4, 6, 620730) I will pass it on to Vinoba.
('66', 353, 4, 7, 620759) You should train the women who are staying there.
('66', 353, 4, 8, 620809) There is only one department of our work which needs to be understood.
('66', 353, 4, 9, 620880) It will be difficult to evaluate our strength if we do not start the publicity work at home.
('66', 353, 4, 10, 620973) Vinoba has gone deep.
('66', 353, 4, 11, 620995) My assessment of his work from the shortcomings he could discern, can never be proved wrong.
('66', 353, 4, 12, 621088) We are all like castor oil plants becoming important in the absence of other trees.
('66', 353, 4, 13, 621172) In comparison, in my opinion, your work is outstanding.
('66', 353, 4, 14, 621228) Take it that it is the end of your work if you are satisfied with it.
('66', 353, 4, 15, 621298) However I am sure that such a thing will never happen.
('66', 353, 4, 16, 621353) Vinoba’s aim in staying here is that he can explain to us our shortcoming.
('66', 353, 4, 17, 621428) Both the departments those of self sustained khadi and commercial khadi, are important for you.
('66', 353, 4, 18, 621524) Commercial khadi, without self sustained khadi will remain ineffective.
('66', 353, 4, 19, 621596) The latter will not satisfy the poor.
('66', 353, 4, 20, 621634) How much of it can they wear?
('66', 353, 4, 21, 621664) They can certainly produce more than that.
('66', 353, 4, 22, 621707) If the poor do not wear it, then there is a fear that they will even cease to produce commercial khadi.
('66', 353, 4, 23, 621811) It is possible that even if one has faith in prayer, one cannot sing well.
('66', 353, 4, 24, 621886) In such cases it is all right if there are no bhajans and slokas.
('66', 353, 4, 25, 621952) Ramdhun will certainly serve the purpose.
('66', 353, 4, 26, 621994) The slokas should be correctly articulated if they are recited.
('66', 353, 4, 27, 622058) Otherwise their translation should be read out.
('66', 353, 4, 28, 622106) However, it should be dropped if it is found to be dull.
('66', 353, 4, 29, 622163) For singing bhajans it is necessary to have a good voice.
('66', 353, 4, 30, 622221) If that is not available, bhajans should also be dropped.
('66', 353, 4, 31, 622279) Everyone would know how to sing Ramadhun.
('66', 353, 4, 32, 622321) But that also requires a little practice.
('66', 353, 4, 33, 622363) Purbai will bring credit to herself if left alone.
('66', 353, 4, 34, 622414) She will be a misfit in a group.
('66', 353, 4, 35, 622447) It is unlikely that Gangabehn will leave Bochasan.
('66', 353, 4, 36, 622498) We do not have so many trained women, so for the time being thereis no other course for you but to manage your work alone.
('66', 353, 4, 37, 622621) It is likely that the urinal which you have devised underground will cause great damage one day, while it will serve both the purposes if instead you make it on heaps of mud which can be thrown into the
('66', 354, 0, 1, 622824) VOL. 66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 355
('66', 354, 1, 2, 622871) fields daily.
('66', 354, 1, 3, 622885) Urine is a valuable manure and the less we use it the greater is the harm done.
('66', 354, 2, 4, 622965) Blessings from BAPU

('66', 354, 4, 6, 623039) 523. SELF SUSTAINED KHADI
('66', 354, 5, 7, 623065) Shri Shankerlal Banker has been travelling in the villages, in order to ascertain the possibilities of self sustained khadi and of the development of other industries.
('66', 354, 5, 8, 623233) Self sustained khadi means khadi spun and woven in the first instance by the villagers for themselves and, wherever possible, out of cotton grown, ginned and carded in the respective villages.
('66', 354, 5, 9, 623426) This is the true mission of khadi.
('66', 354, 5, 10, 623461) The end can only be achieved by persistent human contact with the villagers.
('66', 354, 5, 11, 623538) They should know the dignity and value of work apart even from its economic value.
('66', 354, 5, 12, 623621) Khadi under this scheme will be manufactured to suit the village taste.
('66', 354, 5, 13, 623693) Bleaching, even washing, will be avoided, for every villager will wash for himself or herself.
('66', 354, 5, 14, 623788) Khadi thus produced will be cheaper than any cloth if its durability is taken into account.
('66', 354, 5, 15, 623880) The town khadi carries all the incidental charges, e.
('66', 354, 5, 16, 623934) g., extra processes, stocking, transport, rents, commissions.
('66', 354, 5, 17, 623996) The village khadi eliminates all these charges.
('66', 354, 5, 18, 624044) The towns and cities should rely for their supplies on the surplus that may be saved after village use.
('66', 354, 5, 19, 624148) Hence no khadi store should be run at a loss.
('66', 354, 5, 20, 624194) A. I. S. A. stores should aim primarily at quality, never at mere show, masquerading under the name of art.
('66', 354, 5, 21, 624302) Who knows what true art is?
('66', 354, 5, 22, 624330) At best it is a relative term.
('66', 354, 5, 23, 624361) A. I. S. A. stores should be original, should introduce village art in towns and have confidence that they will win the day.
('66', 354, 5, 24, 624486) Every piece of khadi must be strong and durable.
('66', 354, 5, 25, 624535) We must not procure fineness at the cost of durability Flimsiness will kill khadi in the end.
('66', 354, 5, 26, 624629) If we cannot produce fine counts without sacrificing strength, we must own our inability.
('66', 354, 5, 27, 624719) I have noticed, often enough to frighten me out of bleaching, that bleached khadi gives way almost at the first wear.
('66', 354, 5, 28, 624837) It is not suggested that this is true in every case.
('66', 354, 5, 29, 624890) It is enough for my purpose to be able to say that cases of bleached khadi having proved undurable have been frequent enough to cut out customers.
('66', 354, 5, 30, 625037) Let all Khadi Bhandars, therefore, revise their standard in so far as it may be necessary in the light of what I have said here.
('66', 355, 0, 1, 625166) 356 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 355, 1, 2, 625208) what is true of khadi is more or less true of tanning and other village industries.
('66', 355, 1, 3, 625292) Workers must not, without considerable experience, interfere with the old tools, old methods and old patterns.
('66', 355, 1, 4, 625403) They will be safe if they think of improvements retaining intact the old existing background.
('66', 355, 1, 5, 625497) They will find that it is true economy.

('66', 355, 3, 7, 625556) 524. TEMPLE ENTRY
('66', 355, 4, 8, 625574) A few days ago a conference of the Pallas of Kulitalai taluk in Trichinopoly District was held, at which the following two resolutions were passed:
('66', 355, 5, 9, 625722) 1. That this Conference views with regret and great disappointment the attitude evinced by the Mahatma towards the Temple Entry Bill in the Assembly and, therefore, requests him to withdraw his present views on the subject and to kindly see that this subject is brought into the Assembly at any cost, irrespective of results thereof.
('66', 355, 6, 10, 626056) 2. That this Conference has intended to request all the members of the Depressed Classes of the country either to convert themselves as Muslims or Christians, if the Mahatma is not pleased to change his present views on the Temple Entry Bill or to agitate for a separate electorate to the Depressed Classes as it has been awarded by the Premier of the British Cabinet.
('66', 355, 6, 11, 626425) I like the first resolution.
('66', 355, 6, 12, 626454) I wish all Harijans will take the same interest in the temple entry question as this conference seems to have done.
('66', 355, 6, 13, 626570) Then my task would be less difficult than it now is.
('66', 355, 6, 14, 626623) Whether it is difficult or easy, I shall pursue the course I think best in order to have every public Hindu temple thrown open to Harijans.
('66', 355, 6, 15, 626763) For, in my opinion, untouchability cannot be claimed to have been removed, unless all temples are accessible to Harijans as they are to other Hindus.
('66', 355, 6, 16, 626913) But the second resolution gives away the whole case for temple entry, so far as the conference is concerned.
('66', 355, 6, 17, 627022) Men who threaten to leave their religion, because some other men, pretending to be of the same faith as they, prevent them from entering temples, have little religion about them.
('66', 355, 6, 18, 627201) Such men cannot be said to be actuated by the religious spirit.
('66', 355, 6, 19, 627265) Temples are houses of worship.
('66', 355, 6, 20, 627296) They are for allwho believe in them.
('66', 355, 6, 21, 627333) Religious persecution is not a thing of today.
('66', 355, 6, 22, 627380) It is as ancient as religion itself.
('66', 355, 6, 23, 627417) It tries and purifies the persecuted who prove themselves staunch in their faith.
('66', 355, 6, 24, 627499) If Harijans can patiently bear persecution, they are bound to come triumphant in the end.
('66', 356, 0, 1, 627589) VOL. 66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 357
('66', 356, 1, 2, 627636) But the threat to desert the faith they have uncomplainingly professed from time immemorial, if their right of temple entry is not recognized, puts them out of court.
('66', 356, 1, 3, 627803) Sanatanists probably do not care if Harijans leave the Hindu fold.
('66', 356, 1, 4, 627870) Reformers will be nonplussed if they have no case to fight for.
('66', 356, 1, 5, 627934) Fortunately, there are tens of thousands of Harijans whose faith remains unshakable in spite of persecution.
('66', 356, 1, 6, 628043) Religion is an essentially personal matter.
('66', 356, 1, 7, 628087) It is one between oneself and one’s God.
('66', 356, 1, 8, 628128) It should never be made a matter of bargain.
('66', 356, 1, 9, 628173) I would respectfully advise the leading spirits behind the conference of the Pallas of Kulitalai to treat the question of temple entry on its merits and not to confuse the issue by the threat contained in their second resolution.

('66', 356, 2, 11, 628422) 525. NOTES
('66', 356, 3, 12, 628433) A GENEROUS DONATION
('66', 356, 4, 13, 628453) During Thakkar Bapa’s tour in Travancore, we received on behalf of the Central Sangh, from Shri Parmeswaran Pillai, President of the local Harijan Sevak Sangh, a donation of a portion of his ground for Harijan Ashram.
('66', 356, 4, 14, 628671) It is situated at Vithura Nedumangad.
('66', 356, 4, 15, 628709) The following brief speech 1 he made at the meeting announcing the gift sufficiently describes it.
('66', 356, 4, 16, 628808) It is now over fourteen years since a school was started here.
('66', 356, 4, 17, 628871) Ten months ago I rebuilt the school house at a cost of about Rs. 800. The school has now three classes with a total attendance of 75. Of these, 40 are Harijans.
('66', 356, 4, 18, 629032) Of these Harijans 34 are boys and 6 girls.
('66', 356, 4, 19, 629075) The number of Kani children in the school now is 16. I have long thought that a school of this kind cannot fully serve its purpose without being made part of an ashram where one or two workers will stay all the time and undertake daily a programme of co ordinated Harijan uplift work.
('66', 356, 4, 20, 629360) I have, therefore, now put up a small building for the Ashram.
('66', 356, 4, 21, 629423) I have also set apart 10 acres of land for the Ashram, 8_ acres of which are planted with about 2,000 cashewnut trees.
('66', 356, 4, 22, 629542) These trees will begin to bear in another 2 years, and as cashewnuts are fetching a good price, this will constitute a tangible item of income.
('66', 356, 4, 23, 629686) I intend taking at once 5 Harijan boys, including 3 Kanis, as residential students in the Ashram.
('66', 356, 4, 24, 629784) A worker has been appointed and he will stay with the boys in the Ashram.
('66', 356, 4, 25, 629858) After 6 months I propose to take 5 more boys, making the total of residential students 1 0 .
('66', 356, 5, 26, 629951) 1 Only extracts are reproduced here.
('66', 357, 0, 1, 629988) 358 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 357, 1, 2, 630030) Thinking that an institution of this kind will work better as part of the Harijan Sevak Sangh, I have handed over the school, the Ashram building and the ten acres of land to the Kerala Board of the Harijan Sevak Sangh .
('66', 357, 1, 3, 630251) I congratulate the donor for his generous gift and hope that the Harijans will make good use of the Ashram which is to receive the personal care and affection of the donor.
('66', 357, 2, 4, 630424) PAISA FUND
('66', 357, 3, 5, 630435) Paisa Fund is a unique institution in India, if not in the world.
('66', 357, 3, 6, 630501) Its creator, Shri Antaji D. Kale, is a poor man.
('66', 357, 3, 7, 630550) Twenty five years ago, he conceived the idea of establishing what might be otherwise called a poor man’s fund.
('66', 357, 3, 8, 630661) For he meant literally to collect paisas—quarter annas—for the promotion of industries and thus help the poor.
('66', 357, 3, 9, 630772) Its visible monument is the Talegaon Glass Works near Poona, which have been a means of providing decent livelihood to hundreds of young men.
('66', 357, 3, 10, 630914) The committee of this Fund celebrated the other day its silver jubilee amid the blessings of many friends.
('66', 357, 3, 11, 631021) I wish this enterprise, brilliant as it has been, a still more brilliant career.
('66', 357, 3, 12, 631102) The committee have issued a sumptuous and readable volume, in commemoration of the silver jubilee, which gives a history of the whole enterprise and a fund of information about glass works throughout India.
('66', 357, 3, 13, 631309) It can be had on application to the Secretary, 626, Shanvar, Poona 2.
('66', 357, 4, 14, 631379) BUFFALO MILK FAT V. COW MILK FAT
('66', 357, 5, 15, 631412) Dr. Godbole, professor of Industrial Chemistry in the Benares Hindu University, has sent me at my request an elaborate and critical analysis of these two fats.
('66', 357, 5, 16, 631572) It is far too technical for the lay reader.
('66', 357, 5, 17, 631616) I shall gladly lend it to any student of this important subject.
('66', 357, 5, 18, 631681) Meanwhile I content myself with giving his conclusions.
('66', 357, 6, 19, 631737) I. Cow butter fat is known to have iodine in its composition, whereas no data are available on this point in the case of buffalo butter fat.
('66', 357, 7, 20, 631878) Both cow butter fat and buffalo butter fat contain vitamins A and D; but cow butter fat is richer in vitamin A, while the other is richer in vitamin D.
('66', 357, 8, 21, 632030) Butter fat as such is any time better than tallow, lard or vegetable ghee.
('66', 357, 9, 22, 632105) Cow butter fat is richer than the buffalo butter fat in the total assimilable and digestible part and is, therefore, comparatively more suitable for children and weaklings.
('66', 357, 10, 23, 632278) V. From an economic point of view, the buffalo is a better butter producing machine than the cow.
('66', 358, 0, 1, 632376) VOL. 66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 359
('66', 358, 1, 2, 632423) We are of opinion that it is worth while trying physiological experiments in India on oils like sesame, cocoanut, etc., which are rich in assimilables, although poor in vitamins.
('66', 358, 2, 3, 632602) Of the two butter fats, cow’s is in a sense nearer to the composition of human body fat than the buffalo butter fat.

('66', 358, 5, 6, 632769) WARDHA, March 29, 1935
('66', 358, 6, 7, 632792) DEAR AGATHA,
('66', 358, 7, 8, 632805) Because I am silent I am able to reply to your letter just as it is received.
('66', 358, 7, 9, 632883) As usual, the newspaper report is an unintelligent anticipation of an event that was not to come.
('66', 358, 7, 10, 632981) Yes, you shall have notice of any contemplated step unless it comes absolutely unperceived by me.
('66', 358, 7, 11, 633079) I remember Joshuah Oldfield well.
('66', 358, 7, 12, 633113) He was of the greatest help to me when I went to London as a lad.
('66', 358, 7, 13, 633179) He is a fellow crank.
('66', 358, 7, 14, 633201) Rajkumari has promised to hunt out Watts’ volumes for me.
('66', 358, 7, 15, 633259) But Henry 1 must be dispossessed if he has them.
('66', 358, 7, 16, 633308) Mahadev’s book 2 is having a wonderfully good reception.
('66', 358, 7, 17, 633365) All village paper is not as bad as this.
('66', 358, 7, 18, 633406) This was given as the very first product after revival.
('66', 358, 7, 19, 633462) Since then much improvement has been made.
('66', 358, 7, 20, 633505) Mahadev is probably telling you how vindictively they are acting.
('66', 358, 7, 21, 633571) It is all being done to consolidate power!!!
('66', 358, 7, 22, 633616) Little do they realize how it is undermined.
('66', 358, 7, 23, 633661) A scholar who has renounced everything, who is as non violent as anyone can be, had undergone his full term of imprisonment.
('66', 358, 7, 24, 633786) He had also a fine against him.
('66', 358, 7, 25, 633818) This they had recovered from his brother who had separated.
('66', 358, 7, 26, 633878) The fine had to be refunded.
('66', 358, 7, 27, 633907) This happened perhaps a year ago.
('66', 358, 7, 28, 633941) Now the scholar who was doing village work has been arrested and is serving six weeks in lieu of fine.
('66', 358, 7, 29, 634044) This is not the only instance of its kind.

('66', 359, 2, 3, 634219) Unrevised March 29, 1935
('66', 359, 3, 4, 634244) MY DEAR AMRIT,
('66', 359, 4, 5, 634259) I have your letter.
('66', 359, 4, 6, 634279) You have been prompt about sugar.
('66', 359, 4, 7, 634313) If you want Ba’s thanks, you can have them.
('66', 359, 4, 8, 634357) Though ‘Thanks’ is a good custom, somehow among members of a family it seems artificial.
('66', 359, 4, 9, 634446) There you are, you have your choice.
('66', 359, 4, 10, 634483) I am sure the thali 1 and katora 2 is a sound investment.
('66', 359, 4, 11, 634541) I hope the plague in Khan Khana has abated.
('66', 359, 4, 12, 634585) It is just a punishment for our flagrant breach of the fundamentals of sanitation and hygiene.
('66', 359, 4, 13, 634680) I have no doubt that the method adopted by you regarding the erring servant is the correct method.
('66', 359, 4, 14, 634779) It is a thousand times better to be deceived for having trusted than to be able to boast of never having been deceived by having been strict and suspicious.
('66', 359, 4, 15, 634936) Only trusting should never mean tempting.
('66', 359, 4, 16, 634978) But this calculated deception by the president is insufferable.
('66', 359, 4, 17, 635042) You should find out means of exposing the deceit.
('66', 359, 4, 18, 635092) No law of secrecy can protect fraud on the part of a trustee.
('66', 359, 4, 19, 635154) And lawyers say that there is no wrong but has a remedy.
('66', 359, 4, 20, 635211) Therefore you should discover a remedy for the public wrong done by your president.
('66', 359, 4, 21, 635295) I sent yesterday some more questions for Shummy.
('66', 359, 4, 22, 635344) Tell him with my love that he will have no rest from me and that he will have questions put to him which perhaps he never had to face in the course of practice.
('66', 359, 4, 23, 635505) You need not worry about your slow progress in spinning.
('66', 359, 4, 24, 635562) You can’t be more stupid than I. Love.

('66', 362, 7, 9, 638356) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, I never gave my consent to anybody.
('66', 362, 7, 10, 638410) I was surprised when I read the news in the paper.

('66', 362, 7, 13, 638570) It suits me very well.
('66', 362, 7, 14, 638593) Whenever necessary, I speak and give instructions.
('66', 362, 7, 15, 638644) But can anybody refuse a request from you?
('66', 362, 7, 16, 638687) Nobody else would have been able to draw me out of my retreat at present.

('66', 362, 7, 19, 638944) I shall enjoy camping in the open.
('66', 362, 7, 20, 638979) We will visit Ras on foot.
('66', 362, 7, 21, 639006) Use my services for four types of work: removal of untouchability, khadi, village industries and plague control.
('66', 362, 7, 22, 639119) Comforting the cultivators can hardly be described as a programme.
('66', 362, 7, 23, 639186) Don’t take me anywhere else.

('66', 364, 6, 14, 642225) There can be no greater hypocrisy than marrying again for the sake of the children or to have someone to cook.
('66', 364, 6, 15, 642336) I would prefer anyone marrying after humbly admitting that he wanted to marry to satisfy his passions.

('66', 365, 13, 20, 643920) It is good you are having treatment there.
('66', 365, 13, 21, 643963) Your leaving this place was also to the good.
('66', 365, 14, 22, 644009) You may certainly ask me any questions arising out of my reply.

('66', 366, 2, 3, 644417) March 31, 1935
('66', 366, 3, 4, 644432) I have your second letter and now the pamphlet 1. I have gone through the letter carefully.
('66', 366, 3, 5, 644524) Your case is undoubtedly strong.
('66', 366, 3, 6, 644557) I feel flattered by your compliment that there is no domestic circle to which I do not belong.
('66', 366, 3, 7, 644652) Even so, my duty would often compel non interference.
('66', 366, 3, 8, 644706) So long as there are divisions even in the same family, they will have to be respected.
('66', 366, 3, 9, 644794) We are one vast human family.
('66', 366, 3, 10, 644824) You have gone further, and rightly.
('66', 366, 3, 11, 644860) All God’s creation is one family.
('66', 366, 3, 12, 644894) But we accept our limitations.
('66', 366, 3, 13, 644925) In this quarrel of yours I am quite sure that you ought not to invite outside aid—outside the Borah group.
('66', 366, 3, 14, 645032) If you break through the fence, you have no complaint to make.
('66', 366, 3, 15, 645095) If you recognize Borahs as a distinct group, the quarrel should be adjusted among the members of the group.
('66', 366, 3, 16, 645203) Any extension of the doctrine is sure to land us in trouble.
('66', 366, 3, 17, 645264) Then, were you right in disregarding excommunication?
('66', 366, 3, 18, 645318) Mind, I am not examining the position from the legal standpoint.
('66', 366, 3, 19, 645383) It is the moral that concerns me.
('66', 366, 3, 20, 645417) From the ahimsa standpoint, you should have respected the order of excommunication.
('66', 366, 3, 21, 645501) There is too much violence in the air.
('66', 366, 3, 22, 645540) Your object was and is to convert the high priest and if not him, at least the fellow Borahs.
('66', 366, 3, 23, 645634) This you could have done without forcing the entry into the mosque.
('66', 366, 3, 24, 645702) Your motive is triumph of truth, not assertion of rights.
('66', 366, 3, 25, 645760) I wonder if what I have said appeals to your reason.

('66', 367, 4, 7, 646466) I note what you say about Amtul Salaam.
('66', 367, 4, 8, 646506) She is also a burnt brick—very much so.

('66', 367, 10, 16, 646768) There was some confusion.
('66', 367, 10, 17, 646794) I have received a part of the letter addressed to Devdas and a part of mine has gone to him.
('66', 367, 10, 18, 646887) I understand about the new Agent 1. You should not even think about Maharaj Singh’s criticism of you.
('66', 367, 10, 19, 646989) A public worker has to put up with all such things.
('66', 367, 10, 20, 647041) Do fearlessly what you consider to be your duty.
('66', 367, 10, 21, 647090) Ramdas’s business is again off the rails.
('66', 367, 10, 22, 647132) The person with whom he was to enter into partnership has himself broken it off.

('66', 369, 11, 21, 649779) And where no principles are involved, is it not one’s duty to respect the opinion of the majority?
('66', 369, 11, 22, 649878) If everybody insisted on his point of view being the right one, we would have neither unity among the people nor any organization.

('66', 371, 10, 17, 652181) What can one do?
('66', 371, 10, 18, 652198) There is no need for me to expound upon it.

('66', 373, 4, 7, 654376) The new glasses sent by you fit very well and now those are the ones I use every day.

('66', 373, 9, 13, 654587) BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
('66', 373, 10, 14, 654605) Send me a copy of the reply received by Manilal 1. Its wording will help me decide what to write to Delhi.
('66', 373, 10, 15, 654712) Such replies are not yet the worst.
('66', 373, 10, 16, 654748) Much worse insults are going to follow.
('66', 373, 10, 17, 654788) That is why we should only go on doing what we can without coming into contact with the Government.
('66', 373, 10, 18, 654888) I think that that is the only way to conserve our strength.
('66', 373, 10, 19, 654948) To yield to anger is of course very easy.
('66', 373, 10, 20, 654990) Perhaps it would be safer to ignore my views regarding vaccination against the plague.
('66', 373, 10, 21, 655077) I myself have always taken such risks and made others take them.
('66', 373, 10, 22, 655142) But, then, I was on the spot on every such occasion.
('66', 373, 10, 23, 655195) It may be dangerous to act upon the suggestions which I have been making from a distance on the present occasion.
('66', 373, 10, 24, 655309) I, therefore, would advise you to be guided by Dr. Bhaskar.
('66', 373, 10, 25, 655369) I have of course placed my views before him.
('66', 373, 10, 26, 655414) Maybe you have even read that letter.

('66', 375, 13, 16, 657584) PATTABHI,
('66', 375, 14, 17, 657594) You have placed me in a most awkward position by sending two young men without notice, without any pots, without bedding.
('66', 375, 14, 18, 657716) We have hardly settled down here.
('66', 375, 14, 19, 657750) There is not enough accommodation for our requirements.
('66', 375, 14, 20, 657806) Is it fair to dump down people in an institution?
('66', 375, 14, 21, 657856) Supposing others followed your example, where would I be?
('66', 375, 14, 22, 657914) We have not yet begun to entertain learners.
('66', 375, 14, 23, 657959) There is little to teach.
('66', 375, 14, 24, 657985) I have taken them and told them they will work as scavengers and labourers as we all do consistently with our other duties.
('66', 375, 14, 25, 658109) Only please do not repeat the performance.
('66', 375, 14, 26, 658152) If you can get money from their homes or from friends, send me enough for their return fares and initial expenses.
('66', 375, 15, 27, 658267) 1 The addressee explains: “In 1935 a satyagrahi, who had been in jail, came to see me and asked for a letter of introduction to Wardha where he wanted to see the Ashram.
('66', 375, 15, 28, 658437) I gave one readily.
('66', 375, 15, 29, 658457) At the railway station he wanted to take a companion, and I included his name also in the letter.”

('66', 377, 4, 6, 659528) There is no need at all for hurry.
('66', 377, 4, 7, 659563) Kamalnayan’s assurance that he will not go to the West till after his betrothal should be enough for us.
('66', 377, 4, 8, 659668) He has to learn a great deal to acquire maturity.
('66', 377, 4, 9, 659718) It is our duty to see that neither he nor the girl is unhappy afterwards.
('66', 377, 4, 10, 659792) If Kamala does not particularly want your presence in Bhowali, perhaps it might be better for you to go to Sinhagad.
('66', 377, 4, 11, 659909) Think over the matter, however.

('66', 377, 10, 24, 660554) The people who had approached me in connection with the Sammelan had talked about the exhibition.

('66', 378, 4, 9, 661257) How did you like crushed vegetable yesterday?
('66', 378, 4, 10, 661303) If you like whole leaves you may take them or you may take them crushed.
('66', 378, 4, 11, 661376) Take only bhakhari.
('66', 378, 4, 12, 661396) Are you used to taking rice?
('66', 378, 4, 13, 661425) For the evening bhakhari and vegetable and tomatoes if they are available.

('66', 379, 4, 9, 662783) WARDHA, April 4, 1935
('66', 379, 5, 10, 662805) MY DEAR AGATHA,
('66', 379, 6, 11, 662821) I have your maid.
('66', 379, 6, 12, 662839) I am supporting your suggestion about sending Rajaji.
('66', 379, 6, 13, 662893) 1 But I must confess to you I have no faith in these deputations.
('66', 379, 6, 14, 662959) The British policy is fixed and rigid.
('66', 379, 6, 15, 662998) They want to carry their Bill at any cost.
('66', 379, 6, 16, 663041) They will placate any opinion but the advanced Indian political opinion.
('66', 379, 6, 17, 663114) They honestly believe that if they give the Indian politicians an inch, they will want an ell and grumble even when they get their ell.
('66', 379, 6, 18, 663250) This belief is not only honest, it is well founded.
('66', 379, 6, 19, 663302) The Indian wants his independence as of right.
('66', 379, 6, 20, 663349) The official says he has no right save that of being governed.
('66', 379, 6, 21, 663412) The official has the firm opinion that India is incapable of governing herself.
('66', 379, 6, 22, 663492) Hence whatever he concedes is given grudgingly.
('66', 379, 6, 23, 663540) Hence no advance will satisfy the Indian advanced politician.
('66', 379, 6, 24, 663602) He may take it only to agitate for more.
('66', 379, 6, 25, 663643) The policy has now been definitely adopted of never conceding to the popular demand.
('66', 379, 6, 26, 663728) They will give only what they honestly think is proper.
('66', 379, 6, 27, 663784) This does not irritate me.
('66', 379, 6, 28, 663811) We have to develop internal strength to take what we need.
('66', 379, 6, 29, 663870) Now see what is happening here.
('66', 379, 6, 30, 663902) Read the enclosed latest ordinance—a whole population being degraded for the sake ofcrushing a few “terrorists”.
('66', 379, 6, 31, 664015) They won’t attempt to know why young men and women are ready to throw away their lives.
('66', 379, 6, 32, 664103) They are now doing what they have never dared before.
('66', 379, 6, 33, 664157) They have evolved a new philosophy.
('66', 379, 6, 34, 664193) Things will right themselves but not by your importing even our best men.
('66', 379, 6, 35, 664267) You must plough the lonely furrow for the time being.

('66', 380, 1, 3, 664567) Those like Dr. Ansari or Bhulabhai will go on business.
('66', 380, 1, 4, 664623) And then they may do a little political work.
('66', 380, 1, 5, 664669) In spite, however, of my opinion, I am not going to throw any obstacle in the way of Rajaji going.
('66', 380, 1, 6, 664768) In fact, I am making the first move.
('66', 380, 1, 7, 664805) I would like him to go even for your sake.

('66', 380, 5, 10, 664903) April 4, 1935
('66', 380, 6, 11, 664917) DEAR FRIEND,
('66', 380, 7, 12, 664930) Monday is my day of silence.
('66', 380, 7, 13, 664959) But I do not mind if no other day is possible.
('66', 380, 7, 14, 665006) I want to see and listen, not speak.
('66', 380, 8, 15, 665043) Yours, M. K. GANDHI

('66', 380, 12, 19, 665139) BHUJANGILAL,
('66', 380, 13, 20, 665152) If you are obliged to write to me without your father’s knowledge, it is the duty of us both not to write to each other.
('66', 380, 13, 21, 665273) Anybody who is unwilling to perform a modest duty facing him in the immediate present in the hope of being able to perform a more important one in future is sunk in moha.
('66', 380, 13, 22, 665444) “Make the best of today, for who has foreseen tomorrow?” But even if you decide to take up the smaller duty, you should do so after consulting your father.

('66', 381, 2, 3, 665735) April 4, 1935
('66', 381, 3, 4, 665749) NARANDAS,
('66', 381, 4, 5, 665759) I got your letter.
('66', 381, 4, 6, 665778) Father’s unwillingness to me is sufficient reason why you should not leave Rajkot.
('66', 381, 4, 7, 665861) I can understand his feelings.
('66', 381, 4, 8, 665892) Now that Jamnadas has gone there, he may perhaps agree to your leaving.
('66', 381, 4, 9, 665964) But just now that makes no difference.
('66', 381, 4, 10, 666003) Also, you cannot leave till you can find somebody to take charge of the school.
('66', 381, 4, 11, 666083) What you write about the school is perfectly correct.
('66', 381, 4, 12, 666137) The right course is to let those who wish to leave go and do the best that you can.
('66', 381, 4, 13, 666221) I will remember about the English teacher.
('66', 381, 4, 14, 666264) Till you get one, do whatever you can.
('66', 381, 4, 15, 666303) I could not convince Vinoba.
('66', 381, 4, 16, 666332) The idea was to lighten the final responsibility on your head or on that of anybody else who might take your place.
('66', 381, 4, 17, 666448) Mathew’s problem was a difficult one.
('66', 381, 4, 18, 666486) I think I have been able to solve it.
('66', 381, 4, 19, 666524) For everybody else it was a difficult job.
('66', 381, 4, 20, 666567) If there is still something which I can persuade him to accept, please let me know.
('66', 381, 4, 21, 666651) But now there is no need for that, either, for the present.
('66', 381, 4, 22, 666711) The question which I asked you amounts to this: that excepting for father’s consent, you should arrange all your affairs in such a manner that you are able to leave immediately.
('66', 381, 4, 23, 666889) At present Amtul is with her brother Miya Rashid in Indore.
('66', 381, 4, 24, 666949) I am going to Indore.
('66', 381, 4, 25, 666971) She has, therefore, gone there in advance.
('66', 381, 4, 26, 667014) Does Qureshi still draw money?
('66', 381, 4, 27, 667045) If you wish to buy land for the school, you may do so.
('66', 381, 4, 28, 667100) If I have not already given my opinion about the Trust Deed, send me a copy.
('66', 381, 4, 29, 667177) My impression is that I have already written to Jamnadas about it.
('66', 381, 4, 30, 667244) A letter for Lilavati is enclosed.

('66', 382, 2, 3, 667480) BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
('66', 382, 3, 4, 667498) So you have been laid low.
('66', 382, 3, 5, 667525) I had a letter from Mani.
('66', 382, 3, 6, 667551) It seems unpolished rice will not agree with you.
('66', 382, 3, 7, 667601) Here everybody can digest it.
('66', 382, 3, 8, 667631) It can’t possibly cause constipation.
('66', 382, 3, 9, 667669) But experiments in food are not for you.
('66', 382, 3, 10, 667710) It will be enough if you can keep yourself fit.
('66', 382, 3, 11, 667758) If you take proper nourishment, you will be all right.
('66', 382, 3, 12, 667813) There was a letter from Agatha.
('66', 382, 3, 13, 667845) She has strongly urged that Rajaji should go to England.
('66', 382, 3, 14, 667902) Whoever goes, nobody will be able to do anything just now.
('66', 382, 3, 15, 667961) But a visit by a person like Rajaji may perhaps be useful for the future.
('66', 382, 3, 16, 668035) Let me have your opinion.

('66', 382, 8, 21, 668186) HARIBHAU,
('66', 382, 9, 22, 668196) I understand about the exhibition.
('66', 382, 9, 23, 668231) Please try your best.
('66', 382, 9, 24, 668253) If the Maharaja and the Maharani feel embarrassed in sitting in chairs while I do not use one, I will not mind doing so for the occasion.
('66', 382, 9, 25, 668391) No matter how much is collected in Indore for Hindi propaganda, I will expect only one lakh for work in South India, that is, the part of the country where the four Dravidian languages, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannad, are spoken.
('66', 382, 9, 26, 668626) This means that a purse of one lakh should be earmarked for Hindi propaganda in South India or in any other part that I like.
('66', 382, 9, 27, 668752) I give the second alternative for earmarking contributions so that I may be able to spend the money in provinces like Assam if I wish to do so.
('66', 382, 9, 28, 668896) I don’t want such freedom, but if we can get more contributions in that way, I don’t mind.

('66', 383, 7, 9, 669295) I got your letter.
('66', 383, 7, 10, 669314) You ought to have written to .
('66', 383, 7, 11, 669345) 1 to soothe her.
('66', 383, 7, 12, 669362) Please write even now, no matter if the problem is still being discussed with me.
('66', 383, 7, 13, 669444) I am not making use of your letter.
('66', 383, 7, 14, 669480) You are still labouring under an error.
('66', 383, 7, 15, 669520) To say that you would adopt the same attitude towards .
('66', 383, 7, 16, 669576) shows that you have not thought carefully about the matter.
('66', 383, 7, 17, 669636) If you adopted such an attitude, I would say that you did not understand your dharma towards .
('66', 383, 7, 18, 669731) as her father.
('66', 383, 7, 19, 669746) As a father you should at least insist that even your dearest friend should consult you before he talks about any delicate matter to .
('66', 383, 7, 20, 669881) How can anybody else understand .
('66', 383, 7, 21, 669915) as well as you, a thoughtful father, can?
('66', 383, 7, 22, 669957) For anyone to talk to .
('66', 383, 7, 23, 669981) about such a matter, and that without her parents’ knowledge, is certainly immoral.
('66', 383, 7, 24, 670065) For the present, however, it will or suffice?
('66', 383, 7, 25, 670111) if you write a reassuring letter to .

('66', 383, 7, 28, 670199) But there is nothing we can do about it now.
('66', 383, 7, 29, 670244) I have no doubt that her mind ought to have been allowed to remain unsullied.
('66', 383, 7, 30, 670322) has been following a wrong path.
('66', 383, 7, 31, 670355) But I have not for that reason stopped doing my duty as a parent as I understand it, though it is possible that he might not like it just now.
('66', 383, 7, 32, 670498) And moreover, isn’t there the true Father of us all above?

('66', 384, 4, 6, 670869) Day in and day out you din into the ears of your patients: “Stop eating polished rice; start unpolished rice; and your constipation will go.” But the unfortunate patient comes back with a sample and asks: ‘Sir, here is what I have got from the bazaar.
('66', 384, 4, 7, 671121) Is that unpolished rice?’ I suppose you will tell him: ‘It is not my business to answer that question.
('66', 384, 4, 8, 671224) You must go and consult an expert in industrial chemistry.’ Nothing very difficult.
('66', 384, 4, 9, 671308) Another fat fee and he can get the opinion.
('66', 384, 4, 10, 671352) What a wonderful age we are living in!
('66', 384, 4, 11, 671391) Now let me ask Mrs. Jenabehn 4 what rice she cooks for you.

('66', 386, 1, 8, 674399) You are not likely to run away from me while Harilal avoids me.

('66', 386, 1, 14, 674763) I cannot discriminate between mine and outsiders.
('66', 386, 1, 15, 674813) Whosoever follows my path is mine.

('66', 386, 4, 20, 675046) 580. THE EXTENT OF MEDICAL AID
('66', 386, 5, 21, 675077) With the commencement of the activities of the A. I. V. I. A., medical aid finds a prominent, if not almost an exclusive, place on the programme of many workers.
('66', 386, 5, 22, 675239) The aid consists in distributing among the villagers free medicines, allopathic, ayurvedic, unani or homoeo pathic, or all combined.
('66', 386, 5, 23, 675372) Druggists selling these medicines are quite ready to oblige workers approaching them for a few medicines, which cost them a trifle and which, in their opinion, may, if they look at the gift selfishly; bring them more buyers.
('66', 386, 5, 24, 675597) The poor patients become the victims of well intentioned but ill informed or over enthusiastic workers.
('66', 386, 5, 25, 675701) More than three fourths of these drugs are not only useless but imperceptibly, if not perceptibly, harmful to the bodies into which they are put.
('66', 386, 5, 26, 675847) Where they do bring some temporary relief to the patients, their substitutes are as a rule to be found in the village bazaar.
('66', 386, 5, 27, 675973) Medical men of the West are slowly but surely finding out that the less drugs they prescribe the better it is for their patients.
('66', 386, 5, 28, 676103) The best of them never keep their patients in ignorance of what is prescribed.
('66', 386, 5, 29, 676182) Instead of overloading their prescriptions, they give some simple harmless drug.
('66', 386, 5, 30, 676263) The best part of their work consists in steadying their
('66', 387, 0, 1, 676319) 388 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 387, 1, 2, 676361) patients, removing their fears and insisting on careful nursing and a change of diet.
('66', 387, 1, 3, 676447) They are more and more veering round to the belief that nature is the best healer.
('66', 387, 1, 4, 676530) Therefore, A. I. V. I. A. is leaving medical relief of the kind I have described severely alone.
('66', 387, 1, 5, 676627) Its primary care is education in matters of health as well as of economy.
('66', 387, 1, 6, 676701) Are not both interrelated?
('66', 387, 1, 7, 676728) Does not health mean wealth for the millions?
('66', 387, 1, 8, 676774) There bodies, not their intellects, are the primary instruments of wealth.
('66', 387, 1, 9, 676849) The Association, therefore, seeks to teach people how to prevent disease.
('66', 387, 1, 10, 676923) It is well known that the food of the millions is very deficient in its nourishing value.
('66', 387, 1, 11, 677013) What they do eat they misuse.
('66', 387, 1, 12, 677043) Their knowledge of hygiene is practically nil.
('66', 387, 1, 13, 677090) Village sanitation is as bad as it well can be.
('66', 387, 1, 14, 677138) If, therefore, these defects can be put right and the people imbibe the simple rules of hygiene, most of the ailments they suffer from must disappear without further effort or any outlay of money.
('66', 387, 1, 15, 677335) Hence the Association does not contemplate opening dispensaries.
('66', 387, 1, 16, 677400) Investigations are now being made to find out what the villages can supply in the shape of drugs.
('66', 387, 1, 17, 677498) Satisbabu’s cheap remedies are an effort in that direction.
('66', 387, 1, 18, 677558) But incredibly simple though they are, he is experimenting with a view to making drastic reduction in the number of these remedies, without diminishing their efficacy.
('66', 387, 1, 19, 677726) He is studying the bazaar drugs and testing them and comparing them with the corresponding drugs in the British pharmacopoeia.
('66', 387, 1, 20, 677853) The desire is to wean the simple villagers from the awe of my sterious pills and infusions.

('66', 387, 4, 23, 677998) A correspondent from Sibasagar writes: 1
('66', 387, 5, 24, 678039) When I was touring in Assam last year in the Harijan cause, I had understood that the tea garden coolies were regarded as untouchables and that the Miris were also almost so regarded.
('66', 387, 5, 25, 678223) Be that as it may, it is a serious question whether, where the priests exploit the superstition of the people and where innocent birds and animals are offered as sacrifice, it is right to agitate for the entry of Harijans to
('66', 387, 6, 26, 678448) 1 The letter to not reproduced here.
('66', 387, 6, 27, 678485) The correspondent had reported about a temple at Dergaon, Assam, where innocent birds and animals were offered as sacrifice and which barred the entry of tea labourers and Miris because they were regarded as untouchables.
('66', 388, 0, 1, 678707) VOL. 66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 389
('66', 388, 1, 2, 678754) such a temple.
('66', 388, 1, 3, 678769) No doubt temple reform is a separate question.
('66', 388, 1, 4, 678816) Entry of Harijans into temples cannot await reform.
('66', 388, 1, 5, 678868) But I would draw the line at temples where animal sacrifices are offered.
('66', 388, 1, 6, 678942) I would not touch these temples till animal sacrifices are stopped.
('66', 388, 1, 7, 679010) Inward corruption in temples cannot affect the devotee who knows nothing about it.
('66', 388, 1, 8, 679093) But with animal sacrifice every worshipper is intimately connected.
('66', 388, 1, 9, 679161) For, he or she hasto offer such sacrifice.
('66', 388, 1, 10, 679204) And a Harijan admitted for the first time in such a temple would naturally be expected to bring some poor bird or animal as sacrifice.
('66', 388, 1, 11, 679339) He may or may not be a meat eater, but who will make himself responsible for the sin of teaching an unsophisticated Harijan that God expects His worshippers to propitiate Him with the blood of innocent dumb animals who have never sinned, who have no sense of sin?
('66', 388, 1, 12, 679603) I wish that the leaders of Assam will purge the Dergaon temple of the stain of bloody sacrifice.
('66', 388, 1, 13, 679700) Let no one retort that the beginning should be made, not with an unknown temple like that of Dergaon, but it should be with the temple of Kali.
('66', 388, 1, 14, 679844) Most reforms have had their origin in small beginnings.
('66', 388, 1, 15, 679900) The citadel of Kali will fall by its own weight, if the minor temples wash themselves clean of innocent blood.

('66', 388, 4, 18, 680055) April 5, 1935
('66', 388, 5, 19, 680069) MY DEAR AMRIT,
('66', 388, 6, 20, 680084) The gur and shakkar 1 are both good.
('66', 388, 6, 21, 680121) What Ba would ultimately say of shakkar I do not know.
('66', 388, 6, 22, 680176) I shall give you her opinion when she gives it.
('66', 388, 6, 23, 680224) Shummy’s note on gur and imli 2 is valuable and I am using it for Harijan.
('66', 388, 6, 24, 680299) 3 He must, or you would for him, warn me when I put an undue strain on him.
('66', 388, 6, 25, 680375) I am having so many medical and chemical conundrums for solution.
('66', 388, 6, 26, 680441) The papers you sent me are going back.
('66', 388, 6, 27, 680480) They make interesting reading.
('66', 388, 6, 28, 680511) But we will have to work out our own salvation.

('66', 389, 1, 2, 680675) When you get used to it, you would prefer loosely woven khadi sheets to glossy linen.
('66', 389, 1, 3, 680761) The softness of the khadi sheets I have in mind is all its own.
('66', 389, 1, 4, 680825) It is light and airy.
('66', 389, 1, 5, 680847) This is no exaggeration.
('66', 389, 1, 6, 680872) The proof of the pudding is in the eating.
('66', 389, 1, 7, 680915) You get the right kind.
('66', 389, 1, 8, 680939) If you can’t procure it, you must tell me.
('66', 389, 1, 9, 680982) Shall I send you good slivers from here?
('66', 389, 1, 10, 681023) Next time you come, I must teach you carding.
('66', 389, 1, 11, 681069) It is quite easy.
('66', 389, 1, 12, 681087) You must not have slivers sent for you.
('66', 389, 1, 13, 681127) You should make them yourself.

('66', 389, 5, 18, 681296) April 5, 1935
('66', 389, 7, 19, 681310) I have taken up for reply both your letters of 8 2 ’35 and 30 3 ’35. How is Kisan now?
('66', 389, 7, 20, 681397) Is she doing anything?
('66', 389, 7, 21, 681420) How does she keep herself occupied?
('66', 389, 7, 22, 681456) Do you still go on with your self chosen occupation of ploughing the fields and working the water lift?
('66', 389, 7, 23, 681560) You should try and persuade those over whom you have influence to save the expenditure on births and deaths.
('66', 389, 7, 24, 681669) All may not listen to you, but a few certainly will.
('66', 389, 7, 25, 681722) You had a good discussion with Nariman.
('66', 389, 7, 26, 681762) It is true that most people follow ahimsa only as a policy.
('66', 389, 7, 27, 681822) 1 But there are a few at least like you who strive their utmost to follow it as a dharma.
('66', 389, 7, 28, 681912) Ultimately it is such ahimsa that will work.
('66', 389, 7, 29, 681957) There will be an army even after the country has become free.
('66', 389, 7, 30, 682019) I don’t feel that my ahimsa is sufficiently strong to convince the people that there will be no necessity for an army.
('66', 389, 7, 31, 682138) If the army remains, military training also will remain.
('66', 389, 7, 32, 682195) But this is only speculation.
('66', 389, 7, 33, 682225) It is not inconceivable that, if we really and truly win freedom through ahimsa,
('66', 389, 8, 34, 682306) 1 Nariman had argued that the Congress had adopted ahimsa only as a policy and not as a creed and that, therefore, when the country became free it would have to maintain an army.
('66', 390, 0, 1, 682485) VOL. 66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 391
('66', 390, 1, 2, 682532) we may not need an army afterwards.
('66', 390, 1, 3, 682568) There is no limit to the power of ahimsa, as there is none to that of the votary of ahimsa.
('66', 390, 1, 4, 682660) The latter does nothing of his own will.
('66', 390, 1, 5, 682701) All his actions are prompted by God.
('66', 390, 1, 6, 682738) That being so, how can he say in advance what God will prompt him to do at a future time?
('66', 390, 1, 7, 682828) There is thus no question of compromise in this matter.
('66', 390, 1, 8, 682884) It is only a question of recognizing the limit of one’s strength.
('66', 390, 1, 9, 682950) My killing a snake through fear is no compromise but merely an exhibition of my lack of strength.
('66', 390, 1, 10, 683048) One might say that God has given me only so much strength and no more, or that I have not purifiedmyself sufficiently—have not adequate tapascharya—to make myself fit for greater strength.
('66', 390, 1, 11, 683237) A compromise, on the other hand, is a deliberate and voluntary act.
('66', 390, 1, 12, 683305) A perfect satyagrahi means a perfect avatar of God.
('66', 390, 1, 13, 683357) Do you doubt that such a perfect avatar can shake the whole world?
('66', 390, 1, 14, 683424) It is no exaggeration to say that this world is a laboratory for preparing the ground for such an avatar.
('66', 390, 1, 15, 683530) If all of us prepare overselves for a partial manifestation of the Divine, we may rest assured that the perfect avatar will come some day.
('66', 390, 1, 16, 683669) If you have such faith, you will not need to ask about the necessity or otherwise of an army.
('66', 390, 1, 17, 683763) The Government may indeed be a machine, but is not the machine controlled by an engineer?
('66', 390, 1, 18, 683853) There is no harm in attending a music or dance performance, provided there is nothing obscene in it.
('66', 390, 1, 19, 683954) But I would certainly mind going when somebody else pays for us.
('66', 390, 1, 20, 684019) It may be possible to pay for one person, but who will pay for the millions?
('66', 390, 1, 21, 684096) We are among the millions.
('66', 390, 1, 22, 684123) In this matter, however, everyone should act according to his or her own strength.
('66', 390, 1, 23, 684206) Preserve carefully Mahadev’s article about bread.
('66', 390, 1, 24, 684256) The problem of keeping the wells clean is a big one.
('66', 390, 1, 25, 684309) It will be a great achievement if you can persuade the people to stop using the steps on wells wherever they exist.
('66', 390, 1, 26, 684425) Write to me in detail the method of straining oil so that I may try it.
('66', 390, 1, 27, 684497) Don’t mind if your weight is increasing.
('66', 390, 1, 28, 684538) Acid things are necessary in one’s food.
('66', 390, 1, 29, 684579) I have introduced here both tamarind and onions.
('66', 390, 1, 30, 684628) If Sushila has been appointed an Examiner, she should share her fees and set a question paper that will be easy to answer and that will test originality.
('66', 390, 1, 31, 684782) My remark about menstruation is correct.

('66', 391, 1, 2, 684883) passion takes a very long time to acquire.
('66', 391, 1, 3, 684926) Passion is so subtle a thing that we are not always able to recognize it.
('66', 391, 1, 4, 685000) It would be proper for Europe to carry on an agitation for the release of Jawaharlal.
('66', 391, 1, 5, 685086) The disregard of the Assembly voting does not fill me with disappointment.
('66', 391, 1, 6, 685161) This contingency was taken into account.
('66', 391, 1, 7, 685202) Entering the Assembly was necessary and remains so.
('66', 391, 1, 8, 685254) I keep silent about Hindu Muslim unity because I can do nothing about it.
('66', 391, 1, 9, 685328) When the Elephant King had realized his helplessness, he started praying and his prayer was answered.
('66', 391, 1, 10, 685430) My condition is like his.
('66', 391, 1, 11, 685456) My prayer continues.
('66', 391, 1, 12, 685477) Let deliverance come when it will.
('66', 391, 1, 13, 685512) Why should an anasakta 1 be impatient to know its exact time?
('66', 391, 1, 14, 685574) We have a large number of newcomers here.
('66', 391, 1, 15, 685616) Cooking has been drastically simplified.
('66', 391, 1, 16, 685657) Everything is cooked in steam.
('66', 391, 1, 17, 685688) Containers for all the three articles of food are put into the cooker at the same time.
('66', 391, 1, 18, 685776) This saves a lot of time.
('66', 391, 1, 19, 685802) Cooking now practically means only making rotlis.
('66', 391, 1, 20, 685852) I am trying to discover some method of simplifying this work too.
('66', 391, 1, 21, 685918) The oil press is still working.
('66', 391, 1, 22, 685950) We continue the cleaning of the neighbouring village every day.
('66', 391, 1, 23, 686014) I visited it only once.
('66', 391, 1, 24, 686038) Mahadev goes there daily.
('66', 391, 1, 25, 686064) You can come when you get time and wish to do so.
('66', 391, 1, 26, 686114) You may come to Indore, too, if you wish.

('66', 395, 4, 5, 690428) It is good that you asked the question.
('66', 395, 4, 6, 690468) There is nothing wrong in my believing that no one can feel as strongly as I. It is no more than an expression of one’s own strong feeling.
('66', 395, 4, 7, 690608) I do not believe that anyone else can have greater love for my mother than I have.
('66', 395, 4, 8, 690691) Do you find anything wrong with this statement?
('66', 395, 4, 9, 690739) The same is true of the other sentence.
('66', 395, 4, 10, 690779) There could be millions of people who practise more austere penance.
('66', 395, 4, 11, 690848) But just the same I can say that I do not know of any such, can’t I?
('66', 395, 4, 12, 690917) Would you look upon it as claiming omniscience I said that I hadn’t heard anyone speak the language of the seers?
('66', 395, 4, 13, 691031) There could be millions speaking the language of the seers, but must I not say it if I have not met any?
('66', 395, 4, 14, 691136) If you don’t follow, ask again.

('66', 397, 4, 5, 692905) How foolish you are!
('66', 397, 4, 6, 692926) When you first suspected that I was displeased with you, you could have had your doubt resolved immediately.
('66', 397, 4, 7, 693035) In the instances which you have cited, there was no question at all of my being displeased.
('66', 397, 4, 8, 693127) I take work from you that is hard enough, and that as exactingly as I can, because I am pleased with you.
('66', 397, 4, 9, 693233) I am not at all angry with you.
('66', 397, 4, 10, 693265) If I were, I would say so immediately and not hide the fact from you.
('66', 397, 4, 11, 693335) You have, therefore, no cause to feel unhappy or disheartened.
('66', 397, 4, 12, 693398) You need not believe that you will never be able to learn English.
('66', 397, 4, 13, 693465) And even if you cannot, why should you give way to despair?
('66', 397, 4, 14, 693525) Is there anything else to make you feel despondent?
('66', 397, 4, 15, 693577) You need not hide anything from me.
('66', 397, 4, 16, 693613) I am fully satisfied with you.
('66', 397, 4, 17, 693644) You have given me no cause to feel dissatisfied.
('66', 397, 4, 18, 693693) You need not, therefore, leave and go away somewhere else.
('66', 397, 4, 19, 693752) After this, do you want any explanation about the instances which upset you?
('66', 397, 4, 20, 693829) I am returning your letter.

('66', 397, 6, 23, 693927) Your decision to improve your Gujarati thoroughly is perfectly correct.
('66', 397, 6, 24, 693999) Master the grammar.
('66', 397, 6, 25, 694019) English will then come of itself.
('66', 397, 6, 26, 694053) If you make a systematic study of Gujarati, you will be able to learn any other language without much difficulty.
('66', 397, 6, 27, 694167) You should do your best to memorize the eighteen chapters [of the Gita].
('66', 397, 6, 28, 694240) Give more time to the study of Sanskrit.

('66', 398, 4, 5, 694486) I learnt only today that Purushottam’s health is again giving trouble.
('66', 398, 4, 6, 694557) He should stay in Santa Cruz and put himself under Gaurishankar’s treatment or he may try Kuvalayanand’s treatment.
('66', 398, 4, 7, 694673) If he wishes to try Sharma’s treatment, he can go to Khurja.
('66', 398, 4, 8, 694734) But I think at present he is not interested in treating patients.
('66', 398, 4, 9, 694800) Purushottam may go to Mehta also if he is so inclined.
('66', 398, 4, 10, 694855) I have an impression, however, that he was not satisfied with Mehta’s treatment.
('66', 398, 4, 11, 694936) He may, if he wishes, come here.
('66', 398, 4, 12, 694969) I have not accepted defeat.
('66', 398, 4, 13, 694997) It is very hot here, but I do not think it can be less hot there.
('66', 398, 4, 14, 695063) Let him try any treatment he likes, but he must get well.

('66', 399, 3, 4, 695778) BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
('66', 399, 4, 5, 695796) The reply 1 received by Manilal is the limit of arrogance.
('66', 399, 4, 6, 695855) Let the Government follow its own nature.
('66', 399, 4, 7, 695897) We shall follow ours.
('66', 399, 4, 8, 695919) I see in the reply the utmost limit of violence.

('66', 399, 4, 12, 696098) But why this philosophizing before you?
('66', 399, 4, 13, 696138) It is not mere philosophizing, though.
('66', 399, 4, 14, 696177) That is how I spontaneously feel.
('66', 399, 4, 15, 696211) I place before you whatever thoughts come to me.
('66', 399, 4, 16, 696260) As you know, I never wish to hide any thought of mine from you.
('66', 399, 4, 17, 696324) The letter received today was accompanied by a copy of yesterdays leaflet.

('66', 400, 1, 5, 697414) Do you realize the need for it?
('66', 400, 1, 6, 697446) Have you any reason to doubt that the amount will be spent on the popularization of Hindi?
('66', 400, 1, 7, 697537) Your remark that the funds will be spent on political workers does not become you.

('66', 400, 5, 14, 697833) Concerning the Khudi incident justice should be demanded from where it is due.
('66', 400, 5, 15, 697912) Can truthful testimonies be got?
('66', 400, 5, 16, 697945) Can any impartial man go there?
('66', 400, 5, 17, 697977) Many such questions arise.

('66', 400, 9, 22, 698161) The funds I have asked for are for the propagation of Hindi in the South.
('66', 400, 9, 23, 698235) Thus I can spare you nothing out of that one lakh.
('66', 400, 9, 24, 698286) If there are any further donations they can be put down.
('66', 400, 9, 25, 698343) Of course the work undertaken by your committee is commendable.

('66', 401, 11, 17, 699085) How can you charge me when you yourself do not write?

('66', 401, 11, 20, 699234) Instead of trying to speed up progress from form to form and save years, it would be better to try to master what you learn in every form.
('66', 401, 11, 21, 699373) Write to me regularly from now on.

('66', 402, 8, 17, 700385) He can’t refuse anybody, rich or poor.
('66', 402, 8, 18, 700424) He was once visited by a woman out to rob him, and he emptied his purse into the fold of her sari.
('66', 402, 8, 19, 700523) It will, therefore, be a mercy to him to free him.
('66', 402, 8, 20, 700574) Personally I am all in favour of the policy of doing silently what we can and saying nothing to or begging nothing from the Government.
('66', 402, 8, 21, 700710) Let them plunder Ras.
('66', 402, 8, 22, 700732) We will get back every inch of the land.
('66', 402, 8, 23, 700773) When to have me there is entirely in your hands.
('66', 402, 8, 24, 700822) But please do not take me out in a procession.
('66', 402, 8, 25, 700869) You may, if you wish, have me at Borsad.
('66', 402, 8, 26, 700910) I hope you will not have a relapse.
('66', 402, 8, 27, 700946) Mani tells me in her letter that the nose has been giving trouble.

('66', 403, 7, 13, 701702) If there is anything you want to ask me you may.
('66', 403, 7, 14, 701751) You make the corrections in the language on this itself.
('66', 403, 7, 15, 701808) I shall then see it and a copy can be made out.
('66', 403, 7, 16, 701856) If you find any looseness of thought you should make a note of it.

('66', 403, 10, 23, 702187) Tamarind can be a substitute for oranges.
('66', 403, 10, 24, 702229) Tamarind, raw vegetables, papaw and tomatoes are enough.

('66', 404, 2, 3, 702795) [April 8, 1935] 2
('66', 404, 3, 4, 702813) GANDHIJI: Does this diet suit you?
('66', 404, 4, 5, 702848) BHANSALI: Quite.
('66', 404, 5, 6, 702865) G. Perhaps the neem leaves are a great help?
('66', 404, 6, 7, 702910) B. Undoubtedly.
('66', 404, 6, 8, 702926) In winter I have to drop them, as these limbs have a rheumatic tendency.
('66', 404, 7, 9, 702999) G. Don’t you find the leaves too bitter?
('66', 404, 8, 10, 703040) B. Well, there are varieties even among neem trees, and while some leaves are very bitter, some are not.
('66', 404, 8, 11, 703145) The palate gets accustomed to this diet, so much so that it relishes it.
('66', 404, 8, 12, 703218) There again crops up the question of the control of the palate!
('66', 404, 9, 13, 703282) G. And where do you sleep?
('66', 404, 9, 14, 703309) You have nothing to spread or cover yourself with.
('66', 404, 10, 15, 703360) B. Just where I chance to be, and have just what I chance to get.
('66', 404, 11, 16, 703426) G. You won’t mind a mattress and a bedsheet and a wrap?
('66', 404, 12, 17, 703482) But I have slept often under the trees, often on bare earth and under the open sky, and often on the burning ground.
('66', 404, 13, 18, 703599) G. Ever troubled by dangerous reptiles or animals?
('66', 404, 14, 19, 703650) B. Hardly ever.
('66', 404, 14, 20, 703666) I was once stung by a scorpion, but it was no more than an insect bite.
('66', 404, 14, 21, 703738) Snakes I have come across and once a leopard, but none of them meant any harm and there was no fear in me.
('66', 404, 15, 22, 703845) G. Any queer experiences on the burning ground?
('66', 404, 16, 23, 703893) B. I must own that there is a species of disembodied beings, but one need not believe in them.
('66', 404, 16, 24, 703988) I have met them, and that is the fear that sometimes lurks in me.
('66', 404, 16, 25, 704054) But soon I pull myself together.
('66', 404, 17, 26, 704087) G. Do you have to speak, if only to beg for your flour?
('66', 404, 19, 27, 704143) G. Do you manage to get it always?
('66', 404, 20, 28, 704178) I have often had to go without any food.
('66', 404, 20, 29, 704219) Once for three days
('66', 404, 21, 30, 704239) 1 Extracted from Mahadev Desai’s “Weekly Letter”.
('66', 404, 21, 31, 704289) Gandhiji had many rounds of talks with Bhansali, an old co worker and member of the Ashram.
('66', 404, 21, 32, 704381) He had been silent for three years and wanted to break his silence only to talk to Gandhiji.
('66', 404, 21, 33, 704474) He had walked for months, barefoot and bare bodied, to see Gandhiji at Wardha.
('66', 404, 21, 34, 704553) His diet consisted of corn flour with water and neem leaves.
('66', 404, 21, 35, 704614) 2 From the manucript of Mahadev Desai’s Diary.
('66', 404, 21, 36, 704661) This source however mentions only one date, while Gandhiji had at least three interviews with Bhansali.
('66', 405, 0, 1, 704765) 406 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 405, 1, 2, 704807) running I had no food.
('66', 405, 1, 3, 704830) Whilst some would willingly feed me, some have doubted my bonafides, some have taken me to be a cheat, and some a member of the C.I.D.
('66', 405, 2, 4, 704965) G. Do you think of any of your old friends or relations that were once a source of worry to you?
('66', 405, 3, 5, 705062) B. Never.
('66', 405, 3, 6, 705072) All memory is gone.
('66', 405, 4, 7, 705092) G. Does the grinding poverty of the villagers oppress you?
('66', 405, 5, 8, 705151) B. Rather.
('66', 405, 5, 9, 705162) That reminds me of all you have written about it.
('66', 405, 5, 10, 705212) I think of some of the most heart moving of your writings like “Death Dance” in Young India, and feel that the “Death Dance” is going on, more relentlessly if possible, and feel that I have no right even to the handfuls of flour I eat.
('66', 405, 5, 11, 705448) I am glad that I do not rob them any more, and the living presence of Death in the burial ground is somewhat of a consolation.
('66', 405, 6, 12, 705575) G. Then, you will some day come back to me and yet fulfil my cherished dream about you?
('66', 405, 6, 13, 705663) Won’t you?
('66', 405, 7, 14, 705674) B. I wish I could say it.
('66', 405, 7, 15, 705700) I do not know.
('66', 405, 7, 16, 705715) God alone knows.
('66', 405, 7, 17, 705732) Maybe there is a lingering chance.
('66', 405, 8, 18, 705767) G. What do you think of the whole day?
('66', 405, 9, 19, 705806) B. I have my mantras which I constantly repeat.
('66', 405, 9, 20, 705854) Nothing disturbs me, nothing worries me
('66', 405, 10, 21, 705894) G. Then all fear is gone?
('66', 405, 11, 22, 705920) B. Indeed.
('66', 405, 11, 23, 705931) I swim in the ocean of peace.
('66', 405, 11, 24, 705961) All that is due to you.
('66', 405, 11, 25, 705985) You taught me all this.
('66', 405, 11, 26, 706009) I have forgotten most of my past but not the discourses on the Gita you used to give us, nor your discourses on Pilgrim’s Progress.
('66', 405, 11, 27, 706141) Undisturbed peace is my privilege.
('66', 405, 11, 28, 706176) Sleep practically untroubled by dreams.
('66', 405, 11, 29, 706216) I have been often held up to ridicule and contempt.
('66', 405, 11, 30, 706268) I have rejoiced in it and often craved for it.
('66', 405, 11, 31, 706315) All I now want is the extinction of even that craving.
('66', 405, 11, 32, 706370) Why should I rejoice over ridicule if I do not rejoice over praise?
('66', 405, 11, 33, 706438) Undisturbed equanimity I want—that equability to praise and blame and heat and cold.
('66', 405, 11, 34, 706523) I wish, if I could, not to delight even in travail.
('66', 405, 11, 35, 706575) But what a dandy I used to be, Bapu!
('66', 405, 11, 36, 706612) Oh, the days of my dandyism!
('66', 405, 11, 37, 706641) It is the mind that makes a heaven of hell and hell of heaven.
('66', 405, 11, 38, 706704) There is no end to my peace now, and yet what a dandy I used to be once!
('66', 405, 12, 39, 706777) With this he laughed a hearty laugh.
('66', 405, 13, 40, 706814) G. Where do you sit all day?
('66', 405, 14, 41, 706843) B. Downstairs, in the room.
('66', 405, 14, 42, 706871) Friends come and go.
('66', 405, 14, 43, 706892) I am perfectly untroubled and peaceful.
('66', 405, 14, 44, 706932) I do not even know who comes and goes.
('66', 405, 15, 45, 706971) G. That is real victory.

('66', 406, 7, 12, 707476) But I shall have to go as far as Indore for my examination, and as for the number of examiners, the very thought of it frightens me.
('66', 406, 7, 13, 707609) Let us see what happens.

('66', 413, 4, 5, 716322) I have been wanting to write to you all these days, but for one thing and another I never got the time.
('66', 413, 4, 6, 716426) I have snatched a little time somehow today.
('66', 413, 4, 7, 716471) Mahadev had had a little talk with me.
('66', 413, 4, 8, 716510) Kishorelal wrote and acquainted me with the matter.
('66', 413, 4, 9, 716562) I understand your problem.
('66', 413, 4, 10, 716589) You don’t wish to deceive yourself or me.
('66', 413, 4, 11, 716631) You still crave for sex pleasure.
('66', 413, 4, 12, 716665) If so, you must satisfy your craving.
('66', 413, 4, 13, 716703) You can suppress it only when you feel a strong aversion to worldly pleasures.
('66', 413, 4, 14, 716782) My difficulty is this.
('66', 413, 4, 15, 716805) How can I, who have always advocated renunciation of sex, encourage you to gratify it?
('66', 413, 4, 16, 716892) How can I help you to do so?
('66', 413, 4, 17, 716921) I can tolerate your remarrying.
('66', 413, 4, 18, 716953) But how can you carry on your search for a wife while staying with me?
('66', 413, 4, 19, 717024) If I invited you to come and stay with me, even though I knew your desire to remarry, I did so not with the intention of helping you to get married but with the hope that your staying with me might help your mind to calm down.
('66', 413, 4, 20, 717251) Besides, I also wanted to understand your change of heart.
('66', 413, 4, 21, 717310) I do wish to help you as much as I can.
('66', 413, 4, 22, 717350) But wouldn’t you on your part that I did so only within my limits?
('66', 413, 4, 23, 717417) Think over this andwrite frankly to me now.
('66', 413, 4, 24, 717461) You may say whatever you wish to.
('66', 413, 4, 25, 717495) Are your efforts to give up smoking nearing success, or do you think you will never be able to give it up?
('66', 413, 4, 26, 717602) Do not employ Mirabehn’s labourers in cleaning those buildings or washing the baths.
('66', 413, 4, 27, 717687) Clean whatever you can with your own hands.
('66', 413, 4, 28, 717731) I am not happy about the labourers being employed even in the orchard.
('66', 413, 4, 29, 717802) I tolerate that being done because of my helplessness.
('66', 413, 4, 30, 717857) Avadhesh has informed me of his final decision not to accept the sum of Rs. 15. I felt that day that you were unnecessarily hurting him.
('66', 413, 4, 31, 717994) He had already yielded.
('66', 413, 4, 32, 718018) Where was the need, then, to go on lecturing?

('66', 414, 3, 5, 718318) If you can go to Sabarmati for two or three days and inspect the accounts, I would feel easy in my mind and also know what I should do.
('66', 414, 3, 6, 718454) Is Titus inefficient or dishonest, or is Ramanlal’s letter without basis?

('66', 414, 8, 13, 718721) MAMA, I have written to Parikshitlal, but have received no reply so far.
('66', 414, 8, 14, 718794) I am sure that the leaf plates made by you must be excellent.
('66', 414, 8, 15, 718856) Show me a specimen some time.
('66', 414, 8, 16, 718886) About bhaji, what you say is correct.
('66', 414, 8, 17, 718924) You certainly need not select a village in a hurry, but you should not delay through lethargy, either.

('66', 415, 1, 2, 719555) 631. INTERVIEW TO LORD FARINGDON 1
('66', 415, 2, 3, 719590) [Before April 13, 1935]
('66', 415, 3, 4, 719614) LORD FARINGDON: What is the real object of the Village Industries Associa tion?
('66', 415, 4, 5, 719694) GANDHIJI: To show the people how to turn waste into wealth.
('66', 415, 5, 6, 719754) L. F. How do you propose to achieve it?
('66', 415, 6, 7, 719794) G. By having an army of self effacing workers who will show the people how they can avoid slow starvation.
('66', 415, 6, 8, 719901) There is no other constructive programme before the people.
('66', 415, 7, 9, 719961) L. F. You should need a very large number of workers.
('66', 415, 7, 10, 720015) And how would you be able to get them?
('66', 415, 8, 11, 720054) G. If the moment has come, we shall find the workers.
('66', 415, 9, 12, 720108) L. F. How do you propose to tackle the problem of rural indebtedness?
('66', 415, 10, 13, 720178) G. That we are not dealing with.
('66', 415, 10, 14, 720211) It requires State effort.
('66', 415, 10, 15, 720237) I am just now discovering things people can do without State aid.
('66', 415, 10, 16, 720303) Not that I do not want State aid.
('66', 415, 10, 17, 720337) But I know I cannot get it on my terms.
('66', 415, 11, 18, 720377) Lord Faringdon was anxious to get Gandhiji’s views on the communal question.
('66', 415, 11, 19, 720454) How was it to be solved?
('66', 415, 12, 20, 720479) G. That has just now become insoluble.
('66', 415, 12, 21, 720518) I fear that time alone can solve it.
('66', 415, 12, 22, 720555) If I can persuade the Hindus to give a blank card to the Muslims, the solution can be had today.
('66', 415, 12, 23, 720652) But there is too much mutual distrust to admit of any such heroic solution in the immediate future.

('66', 415, 14, 25, 720771) 632. NO DISAPPOINTMENT
('66', 415, 15, 26, 720794) Har Dayal Nag, probably the oldest leader at work in all India, writes: 2
('66', 415, 16, 27, 720868) I feel disappointed to notice want of sufficient rally round you in the work of your All India Village Industries Association.
('66', 415, 16, 28, 720995) I have been studying the economic aspect of the problem of village industries since the beginning of my public life.
('66', 415, 16, 29, 721112) Your programme does not enthuse me much simply because I miss in it that economic aspect.
('66', 415, 17, 30, 721202) 1 Extracted from Mahadev Desai’s “Weekly Notes”.
('66', 415, 17, 31, 721251) Since Gandhiji was observing silence he gave his answers in writing.
('66', 415, 17, 32, 721320) 2 Only extracts are reproduced here.
('66', 416, 0, 1, 721357) VOL. 66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 417
('66', 416, 1, 2, 721404) Imagine for a while that India is flooded with cottage made goods; but manufacture of goods without consumers or purchasers is nothing but a loss.
('66', 416, 1, 3, 721551) The hand loom can produce khaddar but it cannot produce its buyer.
('66', 416, 1, 4, 721618) My painful experience is that many of those who spin do not wear any cloth made out of their self spun.
('66', 416, 1, 5, 721722) The gur producer may taste a bit of it for the sake of lip loyalty to the country, but will he mix it with his tea or milk?
('66', 416, 1, 6, 721846) Will the owner of a village shoe factory use rough shoes of his own factory in preference to fine pleasurable cheap imported shoes?
('66', 416, 1, 7, 721978) The Indian cottagers will never eschew foreign goods unless and until they are taught to learn that no foreign goods can be cheaper than the goods which they can produce with their own raw materials and spare labour and for their own use.
('66', 416, 1, 8, 722217) Har Dayalbabu has earned his rest, and no one will complain if he retires from all public work.
('66', 416, 1, 9, 722313) But like his three competitors, Pandit Malaviyaji, Abbas Tyabji and Vijayaraghavachariar, he insists on working.
('66', 416, 1, 10, 722426) He can, therefore, expect no indulgence from critics on the ground of age.
('66', 416, 1, 11, 722501) I know he wants none.
('66', 416, 1, 12, 722523) His body and his intellect remain unimpaired and are ever at the disposal of the nation.
('66', 416, 1, 13, 722612) Let me then tell him that those who are actually working have no sense of disappointment.
('66', 416, 1, 14, 722702) The ground is so new that it takes long to prepare.
('66', 416, 1, 15, 722754) The workers are not able to cope with what they have on their hands.
('66', 416, 1, 16, 722823) I suggest then that Har Dayalbabu has the sense of disappointment for the very reason he has given.
('66', 416, 1, 17, 722923) He pleads guilty to the charge of neglect of duty.
('66', 416, 1, 18, 722974) If he had, as is his wont, taken up thework, he would no doubt have found it very difficult but he would certainly not have been disappointed.
('66', 416, 1, 19, 723117) He misses the economic aspect because he has not worked to see it.
('66', 416, 1, 20, 723184) Having been immersed in Harijan work, I discovered that if India was not to perish, we had to begin with the lowest rung of the ladder.
('66', 416, 1, 21, 723320) If that was rotten, all work done at the top or at the intermediate rungs was bound ultimately to fail.
('66', 416, 1, 22, 723424) There is more than the economic aspect in the programme before the country.
('66', 416, 1, 23, 723500) To provide nourishing food for the nation in the manner sketched in the programme is to give it both money and health.
('66', 416, 1, 24, 723619) For the villagers to pound their own rice and eat it unpolished whole, means saving at least thirty crores of rupees per year and promoting health.
('66', 416, 1, 25, 723767) But the tragedy of it is that we have no such thing as unpolished whole rice to be had in the ordinary bazaar.
('66', 416, 1, 26, 723878) And the Association has to wait some days before it can give a clear lead to the
('66', 417, 0, 1, 723959) 418 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 417, 1, 2, 724001) nation.
('66', 417, 1, 3, 724009) The nation requires education as to the food to be taken and the manner in which it has to be prepared.
('66', 417, 1, 4, 724113) This is no programme of preparing shoddy goods in the villages and forcing them on unwilling buyers.
('66', 417, 1, 5, 724214) There is to be no competition, foredoomed to failure, with foreign or swadeshi corresponding articles.
('66', 417, 1, 6, 724317) The villagers are to be their own buyers.
('66', 417, 1, 7, 724359) They will primarily consume what they produce.
('66', 417, 1, 8, 724406) For they are ninety per cent of the population.
('66', 417, 1, 9, 724454) They will manufacture for the cities what the latter want and what they can usefully manufacture.
('66', 417, 1, 10, 724552) Most undoubtedly people will be advised to use gur for their milk and tea.
('66', 417, 1, 11, 724627) They will be told, as they are being told, that it is a superstition to think that gur taken in milk or tea is injurious to health.
('66', 417, 1, 12, 724759) One correspondent says that on his wife beginning to take gur with her tea instead of sugar she lost her constipation.
('66', 417, 1, 13, 724878) I am not surprised, because gur has a mild laxative effect which sugar certainly has not.
('66', 417, 1, 14, 724968) The middle class people have exploited the villages.
('66', 417, 1, 15, 725021) Some of them are now making reparation by making them realize their dignity and importance in the national evolution.
('66', 417, 1, 16, 725139) Then take the question of sanitation.
('66', 417, 1, 17, 725177) Proper attention to it gives the country two rupees per year per head.
('66', 417, 1, 18, 725248) That means sixty crores of rupees per annum in addition to better health and greater efficiency.
('66', 417, 1, 19, 725345) The present programme is the foundation of an all round improvement in the tottering condition of the seven lacs of India’s villages.
('66', 417, 1, 20, 725479) It is work that is long overdue.
('66', 417, 1, 21, 725512) It has to be done, no matter what India’s political condition is.
('66', 417, 1, 22, 725578) It includes every class of villagers from the scavenger to the sowcar.
('66', 417, 1, 23, 725649) It is work in which all partiescan whole heartedly join.
('66', 417, 1, 24, 725706) Its future is assured if a supply of workers can be assured.

('66', 417, 4, 27, 725809) Seth Achalsingh of Agra wrote to me two months ago a letter describing a scene he had witnessed for the first time in his life.
('66', 417, 4, 28, 725937) He had seen pigs, with their mouths gagged, being roasted alive by Harijans.
('66', 417, 4, 29, 726014) I was horrified by the description.
('66', 417, 4, 30, 726050) But I know that pigs are used as food by Sikhs, and also by thousands of Hindus in Andhra Desha.
('66', 417, 4, 31, 726147) It is possible that pig flesh is eaten in the other parts of India by non Harijans.
('66', 417, 4, 32, 726231) The only thing that can be said with certainty is that, apart from vegetarians, Mussalmans alone never eat pig’s flesh.
('66', 418, 0, 1, 726351) VOL. 66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 419
('66', 418, 1, 2, 726398) Co workers in Wardha, who have been eyewitnesses, tell me that humaner people suffocate pigs to death and immediately proceed to roast them whole.
('66', 418, 1, 3, 726545) Those who are devoid altogether of the humane instinct roast them alive.
('66', 418, 1, 4, 726618) A party, armed with powerful lathis, surrounds the fire to which the poor animal is consigned, and hits him with lathis as, writhing in pain, he is trying to run out of the burning fire.
('66', 418, 1, 5, 726805) Here is the reply received from Sjt.
('66', 418, 1, 6, 726842) Bapineedu to whom I referred for information as to the practice in Andhra.
('66', 418, 2, 7, 726917) “In killing pigs, various methods are adopted in various places of Andhra, but all the methods are extremely cruel.
('66', 418, 2, 8, 727033) They are as follows:
('66', 418, 3, 9, 727054) 1. A pig is caught, and its legs are tied fast with a long rope.
('66', 418, 3, 10, 727119) Then another cord is tied very tightly round its mouth above the nostrils.
('66', 418, 3, 11, 727194) This disables the animal from breathing, and it dies after some time due to asphyxiation.
('66', 418, 3, 12, 727284) This method is most common.
('66', 418, 4, 13, 727312) 2. As stated in the former paragraph the animal’s legs are tied fast, and, instead of tying another cord round its mouth, it is submerged in water, and allowed to die of drowning.
('66', 418, 5, 14, 727492) 3. A third method is to tie its legs, and to pierce it with a spear and hold it thus till it dies.
('66', 418, 5, 15, 727591) The pig, being a very sturdy animal, does not die easily, and suffers for a long time.
('66', 418, 6, 16, 727678) 4. Another method is that its forelegs and hind legs are tied separately and two persons hold them tightly after laying the pig upside down.
('66', 418, 6, 17, 727819) A third man then beats it to death by dealing blows on its chest.
('66', 418, 6, 18, 727885) The animal suffers much more terribly in this case than in the previous cases.
('66', 418, 7, 19, 727964) I am also informed that nowadays some people shoot it with a gun, but it is very rare.
('66', 418, 8, 20, 728051) Harijans eat pork rather rarely on account of its being dear.
('66', 418, 8, 21, 728113) But it is an indispensable item on the menu on festive occasions.
('66', 418, 8, 22, 728179) In some places, Harijans purchase them at a very young age, and rear them till they are fit to be slaughtered.
('66', 418, 8, 23, 728290) Then the whole village combines itself, and purchases the animal from the owner.
('66', 418, 8, 24, 728371) After it is killed, it is shared among the whole village, its cost being borne by them equally.”
('66', 418, 9, 25, 728468) Bapineedu supplements his letter with an American bulletin entitled “We can kill a hog”.
('66', 418, 9, 26, 728557) I had to perform the painful task of reading the bulletin containing for me the most repelling description of how pigs are killed for meat.
('66', 418, 9, 27, 728697) There is not much to choose in the methods described above.
('66', 418, 9, 28, 728757) If one is to consider the degrees of cruelty, the pig seems to require the most cruelty before it can be killed.
('66', 418, 9, 29, 728870) My purpose in writing this is to show that Harijans are the least offenders in this matter, not, I admit, from choice but from sheer necessity.
('66', 419, 0, 1, 729014) 420 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 419, 1, 2, 729056) question raised by Seth Achalsingh therefore resloves itself into one not of Harijan reform but of broad humanitarian reform.
('66', 419, 1, 3, 729182) We must not take up any stick that comes our way to beat the poor Harijan with.
('66', 419, 1, 4, 729262) But the reform is not the less urgent because it does not specially concern Harijans.
('66', 419, 1, 5, 729348) If our sense of right and wrong had not become blunt, we would recognize that animals had rights, no less than men.
('66', 419, 1, 6, 729464) This education of the heart is the proper function of humanitarian leagues.
('66', 419, 1, 7, 729540) I know that the lower creation groans under the arrogant lordship of man.
('66', 419, 1, 8, 729614) He counts no cruelty too repulsive when he wants to satisfy his appetite, whether lawful or unlawful.

('66', 419, 4, 11, 729746) FULL REPENTANCE
('66', 419, 5, 12, 729762) Some time ago I referred in these columns to the case of a young man from Bahraich who was living on public charity.
('66', 419, 5, 13, 729879) 1 As has already been stated, he returned to me fully repentant.
('66', 419, 5, 14, 729944) He is still at Maganwadi regularly working with us and doing his share of physical labour.
('66', 419, 5, 15, 730035) He will soon earn his fare for going to Bahraich.
('66', 419, 5, 16, 730085) But having found himself in Maganwadi, he does not want to leave as soon as he has earned his fare.
('66', 419, 5, 17, 730185) He proposes to learn something and benefit by his stay in our midst.
('66', 419, 5, 18, 730254) His friends in Bahraich have been pained over the criticism of his conduct.
('66', 419, 5, 19, 730330) Avadhesh, for that is the young man’s name, admits the justness of my criticism though he says in extenuation that he had no guilty conscience when he was travelling and living on charity as, he says, is the custom among Ramanujis.
('66', 419, 5, 20, 730562) But now that he has discovered his error, he promises never to repeat it.
('66', 419, 5, 21, 730636) He has thus turned the error to good account and purged himself of any stigma that might have been brought on him by my criticism.
('66', 419, 5, 22, 730767) It is to be wished that many others, who like Avadhesh are living on charity, will profit by his example and like him turn over a new leaf of the book of life.
('66', 419, 5, 23, 730927) To err is human; it is noble after discovery to correct the error and determine never to repeat it.
('66', 419, 6, 24, 731027) A RESULT OF UNTOUCHABILITY
('66', 419, 7, 25, 731054) The readers of Harijan are familiar with the story of the

('66', 420, 0, 1, 731158) VOL. 66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 421
('66', 420, 1, 2, 731205) persecutions of Harijans by Nattars in Karaikudi.
('66', 420, 1, 3, 731255) Now comes a similar story from Rajputana.
('66', 420, 1, 4, 731297) Khudi is a little village attached to Sikar, an understate to Jaipur.
('66', 420, 1, 5, 731367) The letters that have come to me allege that on 28th March last a horde of Rajputs surrounded a marriage party of Jats and delivered a terrible lathi charge on the defenceless Jats for their effrontery in taking the bridegroom in procession on horseback.
('66', 420, 1, 6, 731622) The custom in this part of the world seems to have been that the Jats should not on ceremonial occasions make use of elephants or horses.
('66', 420, 1, 7, 731760) It was believed that the matter was adjusted between the rival parties and that the Jats could make use of these animals for riding on any occasion.
('66', 420, 1, 8, 731909) But events seem to have shown that whosoever made the pact could not compel its observance by the Rajputs as a whole.
('66', 420, 1, 9, 732027) It is said that the charge was preceded by the premeditated murder of a Jat.
('66', 420, 1, 10, 732104) Over 40 persons are reported to have been seriously injured during the charge, one of the victims having succumbed to the injuries.
('66', 420, 1, 11, 732236) Let us hope that the State authorities will carry on full investigation into the matter and afford due protection to the poor Jats in the exercise of rights common to all humanity.
('66', 420, 1, 12, 732417) What concerns us here is the fact that this senseless persecution is a direct result of untouchability—the belief that God has created beings of whom some are superior to others, so much so that in the extreme limit the inferior beings become untouchable or even unseeable.
('66', 420, 1, 13, 732691) The alleged persecution of the Jats of Khudi is a species of untouchability different only in degree from the form familiar to the readers of Harijan.
('66', 420, 1, 14, 732842) If we succeed in dealing with the extreme form, the rest will certainly disappear.
('66', 420, 1, 15, 732925) It is therefore necessary to deal with the fiend in a summary and most expeditious manner.
('66', 420, 2, 16, 733016) A REWARD OF SERVICE
('66', 420, 3, 17, 733036) A worker of Darbhanga writes:
('66', 420, 4, 18, 733066) During the Holi holidays I went to my village.
('66', 420, 4, 19, 733113) Finding the streets very dirty, I thought I would clean them, and accordingly I invited the young men to turn the holiday to good account by helping me to clean up the dirt.
('66', 420, 4, 20, 733287) About thirty of them responded.
('66', 420, 4, 21, 733319) Shovels in hand we worked for four hours, gathered the dirt and buried it in a pit.
('66', 420, 4, 22, 733403) We thought we had done a good day’s work.
('66', 420, 4, 23, 733445) Not so thought the village elders.
('66', 420, 4, 24, 733480) They thought that we had degraded ourselves by becoming scavengers—untouchables of the worst type.
('66', 420, 4, 25, 733579) So they met and pronounced an order of excommunication against all who had done the work.
('66', 420, 4, 26, 733669) I am glad to say that the young men are not frightened.
('66', 421, 0, 1, 733725) 422 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 421, 1, 2, 733767) This worker and his young helpers deserve warm congratula tions for their very meritorious service.
('66', 421, 1, 3, 733867) The order of excommunication shows with what ignorance reformers have to deal.
('66', 421, 1, 4, 733946) The only way to bear down the opposition is on the one hand not to resent persecution and on the other to persevere in the service regardless of personal consequences.
('66', 421, 1, 5, 734114) Workers may be sure that if they preserve their equanimity and continue the service, those who are cursing them today will be blessing them tomorrow when they realize what a precious and noble service scavenging is.
('66', 421, 1, 6, 734330) It will presently come to be regarded as a service of the highest order.
('66', 421, 2, 7, 734403) ABOUT NIGHT SOIL PITS
('66', 421, 3, 8, 734425) A correspondent asks:
('66', 421, 4, 9, 734447) 1. what is the length of time that should lapse before a pit one foot deep could be dug in the same place for a second time, for evacuation?
('66', 421, 4, 10, 734588) 2. Usually fields are ploughed immediately after paddy is sown.
('66', 421, 4, 11, 734652) If night soil is buried in the fields about a week prior to sowing, will it not come up to the surface when the field is ploughed and thus contaminate the feet of the workmen and of the bulls?
('66', 421, 4, 12, 734845) (1) When superficial burial takes place, according to Poore’s formula, seeds may be safely sown after a fortnight’s at the most.
('66', 421, 4, 13, 734974) The same soil will used for further burial after a year’s use.
('66', 421, 4, 14, 735037) (2) The question of soiling the feet, whether of human beings or of cattle can never arise, as nothing can or should be sown without the night soil being turned into good sweet smelling manure, which one handles freely without any hesitation.

('66', 421, 6, 16, 735299) 635. SILENT WORK
('66', 421, 7, 17, 735316) Jayaramdas, an old Ashram inmate from Ceylon, through whom I have endeavoured to keep myself somewhat in touch with the recent outbreak of virulent malaria in Ceylon, writes: 1
('66', 421, 8, 18, 735493) I am glad to be able to state that the epidemic is now on the wane and we have closed 6 out of the 11 convalescent homes.
('66', 421, 8, 19, 735615) The following number of patients have been attended to by us without a single casualty.
('66', 421, 9, 20, 735703) 1 Only extracts are reproduced here.
('66', 421, 9, 21, 735740) 2 The table is not reproduced.
('66', 421, 9, 22, 735771) 1896 patients were admitted, 1729 were cured and released 167 were still under treatment.
('66', 422, 0, 1, 735861) VOL. 66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 423
('66', 422, 1, 2, 735908) The number of volunteers now working is 85 composed of 21 Bhikkus and 64 laymen; besides we have 12 Bhikkus and 78 laymen as helpers.
('66', 422, 2, 3, 736042) Appeals for help were received by me from Ceylon.
('66', 422, 2, 4, 736092) I had made such inquiries as I could.
('66', 422, 2, 5, 736130) There is a large Tamilian settlement in Ceylon.
('66', 422, 2, 6, 736178) Such aid as was possible was being given by it.
('66', 422, 2, 7, 736226) Most of the relief measures were in the hands of the Government of Ceylon.
('66', 422, 2, 8, 736301) But the poverty of the people and their ignorance of the first principles of hygiene rendered effective aid impossible.
('66', 422, 2, 9, 736421) Some voluntary aid was organized by workers like Sjt.
('66', 422, 2, 10, 736475) Jayaramdas.
('66', 422, 2, 11, 736487) The greatest good that the severe outbreak of malaria did was to discover the Bhikkus of Ceylon.
('66', 422, 2, 12, 736584) ‘They toil not, neither do they spin.’ They do a little bit of teaching.
('66', 422, 2, 13, 736657) If they wished, they could, by serving society in a tangible way, rid the beautiful Island of want and disease and restore the beauty with which Nature has endowed it and which man has ravished.
('66', 422, 2, 14, 736852) It should be the duty and the privilege of the Bhikkus to carry the message of goddess Hygeia to every cottage of Ceylon.
('66', 422, 2, 15, 736974) It is criminal to go off to sleep when disease in its virulent form abates and to wake up when it revives.
('66', 422, 2, 16, 737081) Real service consists in devising measures that would make a recurrence impossible.
('66', 422, 2, 17, 737165) An object lesson is being taught us by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel who has just now buried himself in Borsad where plague has broken out.
('66', 422, 2, 18, 737300) Assisted by Dr. Bhasker Patel and a band of volunteers, he is giving medical aid to those in need.
('66', 422, 2, 19, 737399) But his enduring work consists in doing scavenging work.
('66', 422, 2, 20, 737456) One by one, he is cleaning, theinfected villages; he is bringing people out of their dark houses and inducing them to live in the open, in their fields, while he is opening out roofs and letting in light, sunshine and air, removing debris, clearing out filth, disinfecting insanitary places and destroying vermin.
('66', 422, 2, 21, 737770) He is flooding the villagers with crisply written leaflets giving them instruction in preventive measures.
('66', 422, 2, 22, 737877) He has made no appeal for funds or volunteers.
('66', 422, 2, 23, 737924) Volunteers have been recruited locally.
('66', 422, 2, 24, 737964) All villages are not plague infected.
('66', 422, 2, 25, 738002) And if the spirit of help cannot be locally roused, it is a moot question whether one should not wait till it is.
('66', 422, 2, 26, 738116) It is possible to bring from a distance experts who would teach.
('66', 422, 2, 27, 738181) But workers should surely be coming from walking distances.
('66', 422, 2, 28, 738241) And so should funds from near neighbours.
('66', 422, 2, 29, 738283) It is good for Bombay and such big places to keep their purses open for all causes that do not admit of

('66', 423, 6, 7, 738601) I have your letter.
('66', 423, 6, 8, 738621) I will start from here on the 19th evening.
('66', 423, 6, 9, 738665) It will be more convenient for you to go directly to Indore.
('66', 423, 6, 10, 738726) The train from here is inconvenient.
('66', 423, 6, 11, 738763) We have to change at Khandwa for the train to Indore.
('66', 423, 6, 12, 738817) It is possible we shall run into each other there.
('66', 423, 6, 13, 738868) I shall reach Indore on the 20th morning.
('66', 423, 6, 14, 738910) You may do what is convenient to you.
('66', 423, 6, 15, 738948) I have been daily reading a few pages from your history.
('66', 423, 6, 16, 739005) If I read the Gita or the Ramayana with the same perseverance, wouldn’t my life be blessed?
('66', 423, 6, 17, 739097) Rajaji is extremely tired.
('66', 423, 6, 18, 739124) He has been after me for two months.
('66', 423, 6, 19, 739161) Let him have rest.
('66', 423, 6, 20, 739180) And it is certainly not as if his help would not be available whenever needed.

('66', 426, 3, 4, 742306) The idea behind giving you tamarind today is to make vegetable palatable.
('66', 426, 3, 5, 742380) In the end you must find the leaves tasty as Mirabehn does and as many I think do.
('66', 426, 3, 6, 742463) Although I have consulted physicians regarding tamarind, people take me to task for it.
('66', 426, 3, 7, 742551) My experience is that I can take four large spoonfuls of it.
('66', 426, 3, 8, 742612) So far no adverse effect has been seen.
('66', 426, 3, 9, 742652) But it is yet too early to say anything.

('66', 427, 3, 13, 744312) One motor car will suffice.

('66', 427, 9, 18, 744453) MY DEAR AMRIT,
('66', 427, 10, 19, 744468) I have two letters to acknowledge.
('66', 427, 10, 20, 744503) Your circular is good.
('66', 427, 10, 21, 744526) It is weak on sanitation.
('66', 427, 10, 22, 744552) No refuse need be burnt.
('66', 427, 10, 23, 744577) It is like burning a currency note.
('66', 427, 10, 24, 744613) Shummy can tell you what I mean.
('66', 427, 10, 25, 744646) When you come here in July, you will know much more about this.
('66', 427, 10, 26, 744710) K. has gone to Andhra.
('66', 427, 10, 27, 744733) He returns next week.
('66', 427, 10, 28, 744755) Fancy Shummy having an ache.
('66', 427, 10, 29, 744784) ‘Physician, heal thyself.’ Your yarn has come in.
('66', 427, 10, 30, 744834) It is quite good for a beginner.
('66', 427, 10, 31, 744867) I could not do as much in the time you have done.
('66', 427, 10, 32, 744917) But then I am more stupid

('66', 428, 1, 3, 745078) Please tell Miss Reynolds that the 2 guineas will be used for the benefit of Harijan girls —the most neglected of Indian humanity and that too where starvation is great just now.
('66', 428, 1, 4, 745257) Of course you will write what you like to Agatha.
('66', 428, 1, 5, 745307) I know what you are going to write.
('66', 428, 1, 6, 745343) But this perhaps you do not know that our Chairman and Secretary are among the most competent accountants in India.
('66', 428, 1, 7, 745459) The accounts are public property.
('66', 428, 1, 8, 745493) Yes, Agatha has brought us so close to each other.
('66', 428, 1, 9, 745544) It is a matter of sorrow to me that I cannot give her the satisfaction she wants in the shape of sending a man like Rajaji to England.
('66', 428, 1, 10, 745679) She does not realize that it is all one man’s show.
('66', 428, 1, 11, 745731) Sir S. 1 does not want to placate the Congress at all.
('66', 428, 1, 12, 745786) He is riding for a fall.
('66', 428, 1, 13, 745811) He does not know what terrorism is being employed in order to enforce his will.
('66', 428, 1, 14, 745891) If non violence is the remedy, as it is, against this evil, we must have patience and all will be well.
('66', 428, 1, 15, 745995) I wish you could let Agatha see why nobody can be usefully sent just now.
('66', 428, 1, 16, 746069) I am sending you some slivers.
('66', 428, 1, 17, 746100) You will tell me how they work.
('66', 428, 1, 18, 746132) You ought to get hold of a boy or a girl who would learn these processes and then teach others.
('66', 428, 1, 19, 746228) I could soon train anyone you may send.
('66', 428, 1, 20, 746268) I have overtaken the arrears of correspondence.
('66', 428, 1, 21, 746316) I am enjoying my silence and dread having to break it on Friday.
('66', 428, 1, 22, 746381) Arrears will pile up in no time.
('66', 428, 1, 23, 746414) You have captivated the Ashram girls.

('66', 429, 3, 5, 746737) You should persuade the Harijans not to pay a single pice to the Pandas.
('66', 429, 3, 6, 746810) Your complaint about temples is just but they cannot be opened by compulsion.
('66', 429, 3, 7, 746888) The act of persuasion is being tried.
('66', 429, 3, 8, 746926) You can depend upon it that there can be no rest without the temples being opened.

('66', 429, 14, 21, 747464) Is it proper that Magan Kutir should be a haunt of snakes, with white ants eating holes in the walls and pigeons building nests inside, or should it rather be inhabited by living human beings?
('66', 429, 14, 22, 747657) Having gifted away the whole place for Harijan work, is it proper for you to retain such attachment as you do?
('66', 429, 14, 23, 747768) Only such people as can fit into our discipline are likely to come.

('66', 434, 9, 25, 754044) 659. LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK
('66', 434, 10, 26, 754076) April 18, 1935
('66', 434, 11, 27, 754091) PREMA, Today is the last day of my silence.
('66', 434, 11, 28, 754135) During this period I disposed of considerable arrears of work.
('66', 434, 11, 29, 754198) I got your letter only today.
('66', 434, 11, 30, 754228) What you say about your coming here is correct.
('66', 434, 11, 31, 754276) Do I force anybody to eat rice, jaggery, onions, etc.?
('66', 434, 11, 32, 754331) I only point out the virtues and defects of the things people eat.
('66', 434, 11, 33, 754398) I consume tamarind when eating uncooked vegetables.
('66', 434, 11, 34, 754450) I soak it in water and squeeze out the nutritive elements in it.
('66', 434, 11, 35, 754515) Even raw vegetables I have to get crushed before eating.
('66', 434, 11, 36, 754572) Onion occupies an important place in the diet of the village
('66', 435, 0, 1, 754633) 436 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 435, 1, 2, 754675) people.
('66', 435, 1, 3, 754683) It is the one vegetable that is of inestimable value for them.
('66', 435, 1, 4, 754746) While it is present in their diet, they don’t very much need ghee, etc.
('66', 435, 1, 5, 754818) I, therefore, have included it in our food on an experimental basis.
('66', 435, 1, 6, 754887) Those who like eat it.
('66', 435, 1, 7, 754910) I have indeed revised my view about onions to this extent, that those who eat them as medicine will not find them an obstacle to the practice of brahmacharya.
('66', 435, 1, 8, 755069) I have no evidence for this, however.
('66', 435, 1, 9, 755107) Teaching of lathi exercises, etc., is certainly likely to weaken the desire to cling to ahimsa.
('66', 435, 1, 10, 755203) Wouldn’t they be taught as training in self defence?
('66', 435, 1, 11, 755256) But I don’t feel inclined to make a rule forbidding those who wish to teach them to do so.
('66', 435, 1, 12, 755347) I have never said that people should not use coloured khadi instead of plain khadi.
('66', 435, 1, 13, 755431) If I have, it was an error.
('66', 435, 1, 14, 755459) Many things will change so completely when we get swaraj that it is difficult to say anything today with certainty about the Indian States.
('66', 435, 1, 15, 755599) But in a general way it can be stated that the swaraj Govern ment will do nothing to impede the growth of their strength.
('66', 435, 1, 16, 755721) Blacksmiths, goldsmiths, etc., are Vaishyas.
('66', 435, 1, 17, 755766) I am leaving for Indore tomorrow and will return on the 25th

('66', 437, 14, 23, 758035) I have asked for your opinion about Haribhai.

('66', 437, 14, 25, 758100) I didn’t approve of his having spent so much.
('66', 437, 14, 26, 758146) All the same, your opinion will help me to come to a decision.

('66', 437, 14, 28, 758244) I don’t remember anything about the matter.

('66', 438, 1, 2, 758460) 667. SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING 1
('66', 438, 2, 3, 758492) April 19, 1935
('66', 438, 3, 4, 758507) My silence 2 was taken just with a view to clearing off heavy arrears, but I now see that that was but one of the many good things I have got out of it.
('66', 438, 3, 5, 758660) As I do nothing except with an ultimate spiritual end in view, this silence obviously carried with it its spiritual advantage.
('66', 438, 3, 6, 758787) Silence is essential for one whose life is an incessant search for truth.
('66', 438, 3, 7, 758861) But such silence is a much more serious affair than this.
('66', 438, 3, 8, 758919) Even writing as a means of communication must stop.
('66', 438, 3, 9, 758971) Truth would speak, if it must, in every act and not through the written word.
('66', 438, 3, 10, 759049) I had a letter the other day from Vinoba who wrote in connection with the slivers which Bhau had made for me and which I had warmly praised.
('66', 438, 3, 11, 759190) Vinoba wrote: “Bhau of course deserves all the praise you have given him, but I want your slivers to be still better.
('66', 438, 3, 12, 759308) The cotton that he has used is not unbaled cotton.
('66', 438, 3, 13, 759359) You should use no other cotton.
('66', 438, 3, 14, 759391) It will have an effect all its own.” I had a sure proof of this some days ago when Nanibehn, who had gone to Nanded to study the processes of fine spinning, came here and gave me some of her specially prepared slivers from unpressed cotton.
('66', 438, 3, 15, 759632) When I tried these, the difference was great.
('66', 438, 3, 16, 759678) The thread did not break at all.
('66', 438, 3, 17, 759711) Not that I spun with extra care, but the cotton had been cleaned and carded with exquisite care.
('66', 438, 3, 18, 759808) I am trying to show what care truth requires and that action is more eloquent than speech.
('66', 438, 3, 19, 759899) Some years ago in Calcutta I contented myself with telling my auidence that they must listen to the silent speech of my fingers which were plying the takli.
('66', 438, 3, 20, 760056) There is another merit in silence which these four weeks demonstrated to me unmistakably.
('66', 438, 3, 21, 760146) I am prone to anger like anyone else, but I can successfully suppress it.
('66', 438, 3, 22, 760220) Well, I found out that silence helps one to suppress one’s anger as perhaps nothing else does.
('66', 438, 3, 23, 760315) How is one to give vent to one’s wrath if one is silent?
('66', 438, 3, 24, 760372) Not by eyes.
('66', 438, 3, 25, 760385) Surely not by physical violence, when one is pledged to non violence.
('66', 438, 3, 26, 760455) Not by writing, for the wrath would disappear in the very process of writing.
('66', 438, 3, 27, 760533) There are a number of other uses of silence that I could mention, but these should suffice.
('66', 438, 3, 28, 760625) Let me tell you that I was not

('66', 439, 1, 2, 760827) looking forward to the termination of this silence.
('66', 439, 1, 3, 760879) I was dreading it, and I should often like to go into silence, if not quite for a month or months, at least for brief periods.

('66', 439, 5, 7, 761088) I am sorry I cannot attend the Conference.

('66', 439, 9, 12, 761295) GANDHIJI: As you sit in your meditation, are you troubled by extraneous thoughts?
('66', 439, 10, 13, 761377) BHANSALI: No, never.
('66', 439, 11, 14, 761398) G. Never during the day?
('66', 439, 12, 15, 761423) B. Not so.
('66', 439, 12, 16, 761434) Whilst I am not engaged in my meditation, I think of the talks we are having, and I put your questions to myself again and again.
('66', 439, 13, 17, 761564) G. You do.
('66', 439, 13, 18, 761575) Well, then, you said the other day that when you see all the surrounding misery, you are considerably agitated.
('66', 439, 13, 19, 761687) Don’t you feel like doing your little bit to lessen it?
('66', 439, 14, 20, 761743) B. No, though it may seem strange.
('66', 439, 15, 21, 761778) G. But, then, what is the meaning of being agitated?
('66', 439, 16, 22, 761831) B. I feel the misery myself, but also feel that I am powerless to do anything.
('66', 439, 17, 23, 761910) G. When a thorn pierces your foot, you pull it out, don’t you?
('66', 439, 18, 24, 761973) B. Yes.
('66', 439, 19, 25, 761981) G. When you feel hungry, you eat, don’t you?
('66', 439, 20, 26, 762026) B. I do.
('66', 439, 21, 27, 762035) 1 The report in the source is dated April 20. 2 Extracted from Mahadev Desai’s “Weekly Letter” 3 In the manuscript of Mahadev Desai’s Diary this is reported under April 10.
('66', 440, 0, 1, 762208) VOL. 66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 441
('66', 440, 1, 2, 762255) G. Then if you find a thorn piercing someone else’s foot, would you not help him to pull it out?
('66', 440, 1, 3, 762352) If you find someone suffering from the pangs of hunger, would you not feed him?
('66', 440, 2, 4, 762432) B. I would, if I could.
('66', 440, 3, 5, 762456) G. If there was someone who was going through agonies and there was none but you to tend him, would you not sit down to do so?
('66', 440, 4, 6, 762583) B. I should, but I could not do much.
('66', 440, 4, 7, 762621) I should confess my helplessness .
('66', 440, 5, 8, 762656) G. Surely, one like you would not shirk a responsibility so lightly?
('66', 440, 6, 9, 762725) The recluse smiled a winsome smile in reply.
('66', 440, 7, 10, 762770) G. But we started with the premise that the surrounding misery agitates you, and that, as you yourself said, you see the Death Dance in ever fiercer reality.
('66', 440, 8, 11, 762928) B. I do.
('66', 440, 8, 12, 762937) But I declare my helplessness.
('66', 440, 9, 13, 762968) G. Only he who has exhausted all efforts may say that he can do nothing more.
('66', 440, 9, 14, 763046) If he has a lame person to attend to, he will give him all the attention that he is capable of.
('66', 440, 9, 15, 763142) This one act of service will mean the service of humanity.
('66', 440, 10, 16, 763201) B. But I could not exclusively devote my attention to relieving the misery of the distressed.
('66', 440, 10, 17, 763295) I would do a little bit, but I should soon feel powerless.
('66', 440, 11, 18, 763354) G. The world is sustained by sacrifice and service.
('66', 440, 11, 19, 763406) As the Gita says, “The Lord created the beings with the duty of sacrifice cast on them.”
('66', 440, 12, 20, 763495) B. I know.
('66', 440, 12, 21, 763506) But are not meditation and worship too a sacred duty?
('66', 440, 13, 22, 763560) G. Meditation and worship are not exclusive things like jewels to be kept locked up in a strong box.
('66', 440, 13, 23, 763661) They must be seen in every act of ours.
('66', 440, 13, 24, 763701) But I will not press you for a reply today.
('66', 440, 13, 25, 763745) I simply want to set you thinking about this.
('66', 440, 13, 26, 763791) You know that you are always in my thoughts.
('66', 440, 14, 27, 763836) G. Not a bit of it.
('66', 440, 14, 28, 763856) 1 I felt I must share my feelings with you, and so I asked you those questions.
('66', 440, 15, 29, 763936) B. Please don’t think of giving me up.
('66', 440, 16, 30, 763975) G. I will not think of giving you up.
('66', 440, 16, 31, 764013) But I want you to do

('66', 441, 1, 2, 764246) nothing that does not appeal to you.
('66', 441, 1, 3, 764283) At the same time let me also plead with you.
('66', 441, 1, 4, 764328) However, I am sure that, whether you are in a cave or working in the midst of multitudes, all is well with you.
('66', 441, 2, 5, 764440) The talk was continued the next evening.
('66', 441, 3, 6, 764481) G. Though you have told me that all that I have said does not alter your conviction, you will please let me harp on the same subject a little while longer.
('66', 441, 4, 7, 764637) B. You have every right, Bapu.
('66', 441, 4, 8, 764668) Only I thought I might tell you how my mind was working.
('66', 441, 5, 9, 764725) G. Of course I know your mind.
('66', 441, 5, 10, 764756) But knowing your mind, how is it that I do not feel like copying your example?
('66', 441, 5, 11, 764835) Of course I should love to trudge about like you from one end of the country to the other; and, if my body allowed it, I should like to live on uncooked flour and neem leaves.
('66', 441, 5, 12, 765011) But I find there is a serious flaw in your way of life.
('66', 441, 5, 13, 765067) As a seeker after truth, if I find that yours is the true way, it would be my duty to adopt it.
('66', 441, 5, 14, 765163) On the other hand, if I feel that there is some serious error in it, it is my duty to draw your attention to it.
('66', 441, 5, 15, 765276) As I have told you I have no quarrel with your flour or with your neem leaves.
('66', 441, 5, 16, 765355) What I cannot understand is that you should ignore a vital condition of our very existence, I mean the principle of sacrifice with which we are born.
('66', 441, 6, 17, 765505) B. I should like you to make this a little clearer.
('66', 441, 7, 18, 765557) G. You know that the Gita says that he who eats without offering the daily sacrifice steals his food.
('66', 441, 7, 19, 765659) To beg one’s food is a good thing, but only after one has offered one’s sacrifice.
('66', 441, 8, 20, 765742) B. I have heard it.
('66', 441, 8, 21, 765762) I was pondering the whole day over what you said the other day.
('66', 441, 8, 22, 765826) I wondered if I had any right to eat my flour and neem leaves, as I did no work.
('66', 441, 9, 23, 765907) G. Yes, you have heard it.
('66', 441, 9, 24, 765934) But the world accepts the principle and acts up to it, e.g., Jain munis and sannyasis.
('66', 441, 9, 25, 766021) They live on alms, but they do so because they persuade themselves that they are offering sufficient sacrifice in the shape of the teaching they impart.
('66', 441, 9, 26, 766174) Here they are somewhat mistaken, as I think.
('66', 441, 9, 27, 766219) It is their duty to impart spiritual teaching, but all the same they must offer some sacrifice in the shape of bread labour, and rather than expect their food as a reward of their sacrifice, they should, like true Brahmins, live on the charity of the people.
('66', 441, 9, 28, 766478) All, therefore, that I have to tell you again and again is that you must shake yourself of this illusion.
('66', 441, 9, 29, 766584) To do no work is norenunciation.
('66', 441, 9, 30, 766617) It is inertia.
('66', 441, 9, 31, 766632) What I have written has universal

('66', 442, 1, 2, 766713) experience in support of it, and my own life is an eloquent witness to it.
('66', 442, 1, 3, 766788) You interrupted your wanderings and came here out of love for me.
('66', 442, 1, 4, 766854) God sent you here.
('66', 442, 1, 5, 766873) How best am I to requite your love?
('66', 442, 1, 6, 766909) Not by treating you to good food.
('66', 442, 1, 7, 766943) You would not care to have it, I would not care to give it.
('66', 442, 1, 8, 767003) But I must pour out to you what the purest love bids the heart to do.
('66', 442, 2, 9, 767073) B. I am deeply thankful.
('66', 442, 2, 10, 767098) I must go over all that you have said.
('66', 442, 3, 11, 767137) There was one more talk on the subject, which for the moment may be regarded as final.
('66', 442, 4, 12, 767224) G. Well, have you thought over what I said?
('66', 442, 5, 13, 767268) B. I have, but, I confess, to no effect.
('66', 442, 5, 14, 767309) The fact is that for ten years my views have run along this line.
('66', 442, 5, 15, 767375) Even when I was in England, I said to myself I should adopt sannyasa on my return, and, if anything, the years that have elapsed have strengthened the old conviction.
('66', 442, 6, 16, 767542) G. I know the conviction has been long with you.
('66', 442, 7, 17, 767591) B. Yes, and I have not yet found any reason to alter it.
('66', 442, 7, 18, 767648) Pray pardon me, if I am rude.
('66', 442, 8, 19, 767678) G. There is no question of rudeness.
('66', 442, 8, 20, 767715) If plain speaking were rudeness, I am simply saturated with it.
('66', 442, 8, 21, 767779) No, I am glad you are speaking to me your mind quite frankly.
('66', 442, 8, 22, 767841) But there I will leave you.
('66', 442, 8, 23, 767869) I do not want to tax you any further.

('66', 442, 10, 25, 767926) 670. WAGES OF SIN
('66', 442, 11, 26, 767944) ‘The wages of sin is death,’ says the Bible.
('66', 442, 11, 27, 767989) That by reason of our sin of untouchability we are daily courting economic death is exemplified by a letter received from a correspondent in Rajputana.
('66', 442, 11, 28, 768141) In a Hindi letter he says in substance:
('66', 442, 12, 29, 768181) “Here, in our parts, wherever I look I find bones of animals strewing the paths.
('66', 442, 12, 30, 768262) No one cares to collect them.
('66', 442, 12, 31, 768292) Village surroundings therefore look like neglected crematoria.
('66', 442, 12, 32, 768355) Dogs make worse what is already so bad.
('66', 442, 12, 33, 768395) You have written now and again on this subject in the pages of Harijan.
('66', 442, 12, 34, 768467) Will you not give summary instructions for guiding Harijan, and even village workers?
('66', 442, 12, 35, 768553) It will be useless if you advise us to send the bones to some bonegrinding mill; for the expense would be prohibitive.
('66', 442, 12, 36, 768672) Then you have to consider the religious prejudice against the use of articles made of bones, etc.” The waste that is going on in this country is truly terrific.
('66', 442, 12, 37, 768833) If, however, an economist were to work out figures of waste caused by
('66', 443, 0, 1, 768903) 444 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 443, 1, 2, 768945) the curse of untouchability, they will be staggering.
('66', 443, 1, 3, 768999) The wages we are paying for the luxury of committing the sin of untouchability will comfortably feed the starving millions.
('66', 443, 1, 4, 769123) It is no small waste deliberately to stunt the mental and moral growth, and to make the least economic use, of one sixth of the population of India.
('66', 443, 1, 5, 769272) But to state the problem in such large terms baffles one.
('66', 443, 1, 6, 769330) For workers who need not think in terms of millions, either of money or men, it is simple enough.
('66', 443, 1, 7, 769428) Religious values have to change.
('66', 443, 1, 8, 769461) In a country like India, where animal life is held sacred, we must learn to regard as sacred the use, other than for food, of all parts of naturally dead animals.
('66', 443, 1, 9, 769624) Harijan workers I regard as having advanced to the position here set forth.
('66', 443, 1, 10, 769700) If they have, they would collect all the bones they thus see strewn about on village paths and put them by till they receive further instructions.
('66', 443, 1, 11, 769847) I am trying to find out easy methods of grinding bones to powder.
('66', 443, 1, 12, 769913) To turn them into manure seems to me to be the cheapest method of disposal.
('66', 443, 1, 13, 769989) Experiments are being made by Satisbabu of Khadi Pratisthan to find out the best way open to villagers of making the most economic use of all parts of carcasses.
('66', 443, 1, 14, 770151) I hope to acquaint the readers of Harijan with the result of Satisbabu’s researches.

('66', 443, 3, 16, 770255) 671. A WORKING SUB COMMITTEE
('66', 443, 4, 17, 770284) Most committees or sub committees are appointed to make investigations.
('66', 443, 4, 18, 770356) But I have come across a sub committee that was appointed to take prompt action.
('66', 443, 4, 19, 770437) A. A. Paul, the Hon.
('66', 443, 4, 20, 770458) General Secretary of the Federation of International Fellowships, sends me a report of a sub committee appointed by the Federation to deal with rural indebtedness in a confined area in Karnataka.
('66', 443, 4, 21, 770654) From the report of the sub committee I take the following interesting particulars: 1
('66', 443, 5, 22, 770739) The extortion evil is like the weather; everybody talks about it, but nobody does anything about it.
('66', 443, 5, 23, 770840) Eight months ago our International Fellowship awoke to the menace of this evil to the life of our under privileged village brethren.
('66', 443, 5, 24, 770973) This is not to say that this menace is peculiar to the villages, but due to the generally defenceless position of the villager, with the ranks of privilege arrayed against him, he is especially victimized.
('66', 443, 5, 25, 771179) Our attention was directed to a certain village which had a vicious nest of extortioners.
('66', 443, 5, 26, 771269) The chief
('66', 443, 6, 27, 771279) 1 Only extracts are reproduced here.
('66', 444, 0, 1, 771316) VOL. 66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 445
('66', 444, 1, 2, 771363) one had come there with next to nothing a few years ago and now owned the only storied building in the place, with almost everybody in his debt.
('66', 444, 1, 3, 771508) His prevailing rate of interest was 75% per annum.
('66', 444, 1, 4, 771559) Roving Pathans extorted up to 300%.
('66', 444, 2, 5, 771595) Finally, a committee was appointed with two leaders, one a Muslim and the other a Hindu, volunteering to serve.
('66', 444, 2, 6, 771707) The next step was to get from one of our Matric students, resident in the village, a long list of debtors; with particulars of their debts.
('66', 444, 2, 7, 771847) After studying this, our committee visited the village and questioned each debtor.
('66', 444, 2, 8, 771930) In the case of those whose testimony at their own risk showed that they had paid back the principal plus a decent rate of interest, our pleader members served a free legal notice on their behalf, acknowledging no further debt.
('66', 444, 2, 9, 772157) At the same time, the debtors stopped payments.
('66', 444, 2, 10, 772205) About fifty such notices were served in course of time.
('66', 444, 2, 11, 772261) The movement of rebellion spread to other villages, even without the process of legal notice.
('66', 444, 2, 12, 772355) We found it necessary to send a carefully written note of warning to the Police Sub Inspector as well as the money lender, enclosing the annual report of our Fellowship, which gave a more or less imposing array of names of members.
('66', 444, 3, 13, 772587) During the last eight months approximately a hundred debtors have been relieved, and thousands of rupees turned into the building of their families.
('66', 444, 4, 14, 772736) After prejudicing their cases by not replying to the legal notice for six months, the extortioners have at last filed three or four suits.
('66', 444, 4, 15, 772875) But they are at a great disadvantage, as the evidence at hand shows, in the fact of their high handed and careless methods of doing business.
('66', 444, 5, 16, 773017) The latest development, and the most encouraging one in view of the initial apathy, is the fact that a formerly sceptical pleader friend is quietly getting together a group of the more idealistic young pleaders for the formation of a Legal Aid Society.
('66', 444, 5, 17, 773270) He has a vision of taking such pleaders (who ordinarily rot around the bar room waiting for touts to stir up a case) to the surrounding villages where, through various means of propaganda, they will awaken the villagers, especially the debtors, to their legal rights, and offer them very reasonable and incorruptible legal aid.
('66', 444, 5, 18, 773598) This is, happily, in line with Gandhiji’s recent call to village reconstruction.
('66', 444, 5, 19, 773679) It is our conviction that the vigilance on the part of the privileged classes, such as those who compose our International Fellowship, is the price of liberty for these victims of extortion.
('66', 444, 5, 20, 773870) This is an example to copy.
('66', 444, 5, 21, 773898) No capital expenditure was required here.
('66', 444, 5, 22, 773940) All that was evidently necessary was to hearten thevillagers and tell their creditors (while such was the case) that most of them had paid more than was due by them.

('66', 445, 1, 2, 774167) 672. SELF SUSTAINED KHADI
('66', 445, 2, 3, 774193) Mysore has always appreciated the worth of hand spinning as an aid to the farmer.
('66', 445, 2, 4, 774275) It runs several such centres.
('66', 445, 2, 5, 774305) The managers keep themselves in touch with the A. I. S. A. so as to keep their centres abreast of the latest researches and improvements made by the Association.
('66', 445, 2, 6, 774467) The following letter from the Badanval Spinning Circle addressed to the Secretary, A. I. S. A., will be read with interest:
('66', 445, 3, 7, 774591) I beg to inform you that Government sanction was received to pursue a policy of developing local market: and for popularizing khadi in villages.
('66', 445, 3, 8, 774736) This was in accordance with the new policy which was followed to keep pace with the changes introduced by the A.I.S.A. Khadi cloth is given at cost price to bonafide weavers and spinners of this Circle.
('66', 445, 3, 9, 774939) Since the month of November, 1934, work was started in this direction.
('66', 445, 3, 10, 775010) Till now we have sold just over Rs. 2,000 worth of khadi to about a thousand spinners.
('66', 445, 3, 11, 775097) We issue cloth and recover the value thereof in weekly instalments at the time of yarn purchase.
('66', 445, 3, 12, 775194) From April onwards, we propose to launch the sales again.
('66', 445, 3, 13, 775252) Our aim is to sell another Rs. 2,000 worth of khadi, this time mainly consisting of village sarees.
('66', 445, 3, 14, 775352) We find that the programme is working quite normally here.
('66', 445, 3, 15, 775411) Similar encouraging reports are coming from many quarters.
('66', 445, 3, 16, 775470) I would suggest to the workers that now that the true message of khadi has been understood they should take all the steps simultaneously.
('66', 445, 3, 17, 775608) A commencement has to be made with cotton growing with a fair knowledge of the conditions of cotton cultivation.
('66', 445, 3, 18, 775721) It should be possible to grow cotton for village use almost anywhere.
('66', 445, 3, 19, 775791) Concentration in the most favourable soil is necessary when the ambition is to supply the world.
('66', 445, 3, 20, 775888) But the reverse holds good where the ambition is to supply the village need.
('66', 445, 3, 21, 775965) A corner in a field can easily grow rough cotton for the village farmer; or a village may grow cotton for itself in co operation.
('66', 445, 3, 22, 776095) If this is done, it is simple enough to see that no imported cloth can beat cloth thus produced locally, either in cost or durability.
('66', 445, 3, 23, 776230) The process induces the greatest conservation of energy.
('66', 445, 3, 24, 776287) Under such ideal conditions ginning, carding and spinning become pleasurable and simple.
('66', 445, 3, 25, 776376) The spinning wheels, too, require overhauling.
('66', 445, 3, 26, 776423) There is greatwaste of energy when the revolutions of the spindle are not up to the standard.
('66', 445, 3, 27, 776517) With this however, I propose to deal shortly in an article specially devoted to it.

('66', 446, 2, 3, 776715) April 20, 1935
('66', 446, 3, 4, 776730) BROTHERS AND SISTERS, God’s ways are inscrutable.
('66', 446, 3, 5, 776780) I had been avoiding this burden since October.
('66', 446, 3, 6, 776827) This honour belonged to the venerable Malaviyaji Maharaj.
('66', 446, 3, 7, 776885) But because his health is not good, and also because he has to go abroad, he sent in his resignation.
('66', 446, 3, 8, 776987) You found some difficulty in choosing another president.
('66', 446, 3, 9, 777044) The Reception Committee had my name before it of course.
('66', 446, 3, 10, 777101) When the Reception Committee’s difficulty was explained to me I was compelled to accept the office.
('66', 446, 3, 11, 777201) I had no doubt other reasons, too, for my acceptance.
('66', 446, 3, 12, 777255) Last year when the question of presidentship of this session came up before me, I asked for two lakhs of rupees for the propagation of Hindi in South India.
('66', 446, 3, 13, 777412) Who can afford to give two lakhs of rupees for this purpose, nowadays?
('66', 446, 3, 14, 777483) “Yes, we shall try.
('66', 446, 3, 15, 777503) If you accept the office success will follow.” I was never so naive as to be deceived by such talk by the Committee.
('66', 446, 3, 16, 777620) I insisted on the guarantee of two lakhs.
('66', 446, 3, 17, 777662) I thought friends had given me up on this issue.
('66', 446, 3, 18, 777711) But God had willed otherwise.
('66', 446, 3, 19, 777741) He had to take from me some service for the cause of Hindi.
('66', 446, 3, 20, 777801) Malaviyaji Maharaj could not come.
('66', 446, 3, 21, 777836) May God make him live a hundred years.
('66', 446, 3, 22, 777875) 1 have seen some portions of the report of your sessions.
('66', 446, 3, 23, 777933) The first session was held in 1910. The president of that session was Malaviyaji Maharaj himself.
('66', 446, 3, 24, 778031) Someone having a greater love of Hindi than he is not to be found anywhere in India.
('66', 446, 3, 25, 778116) How wonderful it would have been if he were in the chair today!
('66', 446, 3, 26, 778180) His sphere of work for Hindi is the whole of India.
('66', 446, 3, 27, 778232) His knowledge of Hindi is very deep.
('66', 446, 3, 28, 778269) My sphere is very limited.
('66', 446, 3, 29, 778296) My knowledge of Hindi is almost nil.
('66', 446, 3, 30, 778333) I cannot pass your Prathama examination.
('66', 446, 3, 31, 778374) But my love of Hindi is not less than anybody else’s.
('66', 446, 3, 32, 778428) My sphere of work is the spread of Hindi in the South.
('66', 446, 3, 33, 778483) It was in 1918, when you held a session here thatthe task of the spread of Hindi in the South was first undertaken.
('66', 446, 3, 34, 778599) From thereon it has been systematically progressing.
('66', 446, 3, 35, 778652) It should not
('66', 446, 4, 36, 778666) 1 This was Gandhiji’s prepared address as President of the Sammelan.
('66', 446, 4, 37, 778735) He did not read it out.
('66', 447, 0, 1, 778759) 448 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 447, 1, 2, 778801) stop for want of funds.
('66', 447, 1, 3, 778825) Pandit Harihar Sharma is always pestering me for more funds.
('66', 447, 1, 4, 778886) I tell him, “Now, please do not bother me.
('66', 447, 1, 5, 778929) You should obtain your funds from the South itself.
('66', 447, 1, 6, 778981) If you have not the capacity to do even this much, you may consider yourself a failure.” It is easy for me to say so.
('66', 447, 1, 7, 779099) But so large an organization must have the right to remain a minor for 21 years.
('66', 447, 1, 8, 779180) Therefore, when the opportunity came, I made the demand for two lakh rupees.
('66', 447, 1, 9, 779257) This is not too large a sum.
('66', 447, 1, 10, 779286) But the gentlemen who came to me expressed their inability to promise two lakhs because there had been a fall in the price of cotton.
('66', 447, 1, 11, 779420) It was quite true.
('66', 447, 1, 12, 779439) Jamnalalji also took their side.
('66', 447, 1, 13, 779472) I admitted defeat and accepted the promise of one lakh rupees.
('66', 447, 1, 14, 779535) Now by some means or other, but by fair means, you have to give me one lakh rupees.
('66', 447, 1, 15, 779619) You may ask why it should be exclusively for the spread of Hindi in the South?
('66', 447, 1, 16, 779698) My answer is that South India is not a small area.
('66', 447, 1, 17, 779749) It is like a continent.
('66', 447, 1, 18, 779773) There are four provinces and four languages—in it Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada.
('66', 447, 1, 19, 779861) Its population is nearly seven and a quarter crores.
('66', 447, 1, 20, 779914) If we can secure the foundation of the propagation of Hindi among so many people, we shall find it the easier to do so in other provinces.
('66', 447, 1, 21, 780053) Although I consider these languages daughters of Sanskrit, they are nevertheless different from Hindi, Oriya, Bengali, Assamese, Punjabi, Sindhi, Marathi and Gujarati.
('66', 447, 1, 22, 780221) Their grammar is quite different from the Hindi grammar.
('66', 447, 1, 23, 780278) I call them the daughters of Sanskrit because they all abound in Sanskrit words.
('66', 447, 1, 24, 780359) When they are in difficulty they call out to their mother Sanskrit and drink her milk in the form of new words.
('66', 447, 1, 25, 780471) They may well have been independent languages in the past, but now they add to their glory by borrowing words from Sanskrit.
('66', 447, 1, 26, 780596) Besides this, there are several other reasons for calling them the daughters of Sanskrit, but we shall not go into them at present.
('66', 447, 1, 27, 780728) Be it as it may, it is an indisputable fact that the task of spreading Hindi in the South is the most difficult.
('66', 447, 1, 28, 780841) But still, as a result of the systematic work we have been doing there during the past eighteen years, six lakh South Indians endeavoured to learn Hindi, 42,000 sat for various Hindi examinations, Hindi was taught in 3,200 places, 600 teachers were trained, and today this work is being carried on in 450 places.
('66', 447, 1, 29, 781154) The Snataka examination was started in 1931 and today there are 300 Snatakas.
('66', 447, 1, 30, 781232) Seventy Hindi books were published there and in Madras 8 lakh copies of them were printed.
('66', 447, 1, 31, 781323) Seventeen
('66', 448, 0, 1, 781333) VOL. 66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 449
('66', 448, 1, 2, 781380) years ago Hindi was not taught even in a single high school in the South but today it is taught in 70 high schools.
('66', 448, 1, 3, 781496) All told, there are 70 workers carrying on the work there and so far four lakh rupees have been spent on this task, a little less than half of which was obtained from South India itself.
('66', 448, 1, 4, 781683) It is necessary to mention one fact here.
('66', 448, 1, 5, 781725) After his tour of inspection Kakasaheb claims that women of the South worked very hard for the spread of Hindi there.
('66', 448, 1, 6, 781843) They have realized its importance.
('66', 448, 1, 7, 781878) They are so keen that some of the menfolk are wondering who would look after the homes if women become so active in this work.
('66', 448, 1, 8, 782005) Is not such progress a matter for satisfaction?
('66', 448, 1, 9, 782053) Should we not encourage the growth of such a tree?
('66', 448, 1, 10, 782104) Even today when I have been given this office, if I do not make efforts to make this organization permanent then there is no greater fool than I. If I have a claim to be elected president for a second time, it is because of my work of spreading Hindi in the South.
('66', 448, 1, 11, 782369) I may not have held any office but in any event I have played a great part in watering that tree.
('66', 448, 1, 12, 782467) Its custodians are Shri Jamnalal Bajaj, Shri Rajagopalachari, Shri Ramnath Goenka, Shri Pattabhi Sitaramayya and Shri Harihar Sharma.
('66', 448, 1, 13, 782601) The accounts of this work are kept to the last pie, and are published from time to time.
('66', 448, 1, 14, 782690) I have presented to you a picture of the bright side of this organization.
('66', 448, 1, 15, 782765) It does not mean that it does not have a dark side as well.
('66', 448, 2, 16, 782825) God has filled the world with animate and inanimate good and bad things.
('66', 448, 2, 17, 782898) A good man is like the swan which drinks the milk and discards the water.
('66', 448, 2, 18, 782972) We have had to face failures too in abundance.
('66', 448, 2, 19, 783019) It cannot be claimed also that all the workers were good.
('66', 448, 2, 20, 783077) Had the work been well done from the beginning to the end, we should have had still better results.
('66', 448, 2, 21, 783177) But it can be definitely stated that when compared to the work done in other provinces in this respect, what has been done in South India is the best.
('66', 448, 2, 22, 783328) Now remains the question of how this one lakh should be spent.
('66', 448, 2, 23, 783391) Is it not necessary that this amount should be spent through the Central office at Allahabad?
('66', 448, 2, 24, 783485) Would it not be an insult to the Sammelan if it were not so spent?
('66', 448, 2, 25, 783552) In answer to these questions, I humbly submit that no insult is implied.
('66', 448, 2, 26, 783625) But for the existence of the Sammelan, the Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha would not be there.
('66', 448, 2, 27, 783723) This organization was born in 1918 in this very town, under the aegis of the Sammelan.
('66', 448, 2, 28, 783810) It is not necessary to trace its history from
('66', 449, 0, 1, 783856) 450 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 449, 1, 2, 783898) then on.
('66', 449, 1, 3, 783907) In the end, the Sammelan made it an independent organization, or, you may say, it gave it “Dominion Status”.
('66', 449, 1, 4, 784016) By doing so the Sammelan did not lose any prestige; it only gained it.
('66', 449, 1, 5, 784087) If all the organizations connected with the Sammelan become self supporting, what can be more fortunate than that?
('66', 449, 1, 6, 784202) The donation of a lakh of rupees which is being asked for from you is for this independent organization.
('66', 449, 1, 7, 784307) They will also have to fly the flag of the Sammelan.
('66', 449, 1, 8, 784360) Then the question arises: “Should we neglect the other provinces?
('66', 449, 1, 9, 784426) Is there no need for the propagation of Hindi in other provinces?” There certainly is.
('66', 449, 1, 10, 784513) I am not partial to the South, nor do I have any grudge against other provinces.
('66', 449, 1, 11, 784594) I have put in great efforts as regards other provinces as well.
('66', 449, 1, 12, 784658) But for want of workers the degree of success there has not been the same; it has, in fact, been negligible.
('66', 449, 1, 13, 784767) Poor Baba Raghavdas is striving untiringly to spread Hindi in Utkal, Bengal and Assam.
('66', 449, 1, 14, 784854) He has had some success although it is slight.
('66', 449, 1, 15, 784901) I tried my very best to give him whatever help I could.
('66', 449, 1, 16, 784957) Through Babaji’s efforts work is going on in Gauhati, Jorhat, Shivsagar and Naogaon in Assam.
('66', 449, 1, 17, 785051) A hundred and sixty pupils are studying there.
('66', 449, 1, 18, 785098) Two boys and two girls have been given scholarships and are studying in the Kashi Vidyapith and the Prayag Mahila Vidyapith.
('66', 449, 1, 19, 785223) One gentleman from Assam is studying Hindi in Barhaj (Gorakhpur) and teaching Assamese to the people there.
('66', 449, 1, 20, 785331) People of social standing in Assam do not show much interest in the work for the spread of Hindi.
('66', 449, 1, 21, 785429) The help that Babaji is getting is also for one year only.
('66', 449, 1, 22, 785488) In Utkal, some efforts are being made in Cuttack, Puri and Burhampur.
('66', 449, 1, 23, 785558) It is very gratifying to learn that in Utkal Shri Gopabandhu Chowdhury and his wife Shrimati Ramadevi are keenly interested in the spread of Hindi.
('66', 449, 1, 24, 785706) They have made their family learn a fair amount of Hindi.
('66', 449, 1, 25, 785764) They are now staying in a village, engaged in this useful work.
('66', 449, 1, 26, 785828) There are also some other selfless workers in Utkal.
('66', 449, 1, 27, 785881) One may surely hope that the spread of Hindi in Utkal will be a success.
('66', 449, 1, 28, 785954) In Bengal even a Committee was formed.
('66', 449, 1, 29, 785993) Everything was done.
('66', 449, 1, 30, 786014) There are also many Bengalis who love Hindi.
('66', 449, 1, 31, 786059) Ramanandbabu assisted by Shri Benarsidas Chaturvedi is bringing out Vishal Bharat.
('66', 449, 1, 32, 786142) This is not a small thing.
('66', 449, 1, 33, 786169) There is also no dearth in Calcutta of Hindi loving Marwaris.
('66', 449, 1, 34, 786231) Still what is being done may be considered too little.
('66', 449, 1, 35, 786286) I shall leave out the Punjab, for Urdu is understood by everyone
('66', 450, 0, 1, 786351) VOL. 66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 451
('66', 450, 1, 2, 786398) The only question is that of the script.
('66', 450, 1, 3, 786439) A script conference under the presidentship of Kakasaheb will be looking into the question.
('66', 450, 1, 4, 786531) So I shall not say anything about it here.
('66', 450, 1, 5, 786574) Now remain Sind, Maharashtra and Gujarat.
('66', 450, 1, 6, 786616) What is being done in these provinces scarcely deserves mention.
('66', 450, 1, 7, 786681) But I hope in this Sammelan we shall be able to decide on some constructive work to be taken up there.
('66', 450, 1, 8, 786784) The whole difficulty is that though the propagation of Hindi in the other provinces has an important place among the aims of the Sammelan, I do not think I shall be wrong in saying that the Sammelan has not given as much importance to the spread of Hindi as to conducting examinations.
('66', 450, 1, 9, 787070) I humbly suggest that we deliberate carefully on this question in this Sammelan and adopt a clear policy.
('66', 450, 1, 10, 787176) In my opinion, the Sammelan’s main task in the other provinces should be the propagation of Hindi.
('66', 450, 1, 11, 787275) If Hindi is to be made the national language, then the work of propagation of Hindi has to be widespread and well organized.
('66', 450, 1, 12, 787400) We do not have enough teachers.
('66', 450, 1, 13, 787432) In the Sammelan headquarters there should be a training college for Hindi teachers in which on the one hand teachers from Hindi provinces are trained and are also taught the language of the province to which they would like to be posted; and on the other hand students from other provinces should be admitted and taught Hindi.
('66', 450, 1, 14, 787759) Such an effort was made for the South, as a result of which we have Pandit Harihar Sharma and Hrishikesh.
('66', 450, 1, 15, 787865) You know that, on my advice, Kakasaheb Kalelkar went to the South to inspect the work and to help Pandit Harihar Sharma.
('66', 450, 1, 16, 787986) He toured Tamil Nadu, Malabar, Travancore, Mysore, Andhra and Utkal; he met Hindi lovers and also collected some funds.
('66', 450, 1, 17, 788106) From this tour he gathered the impression that there is a feeling among a section of the people that we wish to do away with the regional languages and make Hindi the sole language of India.
('66', 450, 1, 18, 788297) Under this misapprehension they oppose our efforts to spread Hindi.
('66', 450, 1, 19, 788365) I feel that we must make a clear statement of our policy in this matter and dispel such misapprehesions.
('66', 450, 1, 20, 788470) I have always maintained that we do not wish under any circumstances to do away with the regional languages.
('66', 450, 1, 21, 788579) All we want is that for maintaining inter provincial relations we must all learn Hindi.
('66', 450, 1, 22, 788667) This does not indicate any bias in favour of Hindi.
('66', 450, 1, 23, 788719) We consider Hindi the national language of India.
('66', 450, 1, 24, 788769) It deserves to become the national language.
('66', 450, 1, 25, 788814) Only that language can become the national
('66', 451, 0, 1, 788857) 452 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 451, 1, 2, 788899) language which is known and spoken by a majority of people and which is easy to learn.
('66', 451, 1, 3, 788986) Such a language is Hindi and no other.
('66', 451, 1, 4, 789025) This Sammelan has beensaying this since 1910 and there has been no significant opposition to it up till now.
('66', 451, 1, 5, 789134) The other provinces too have accepted this fact.
('66', 451, 1, 6, 789183) Kakasaheb found among the people a second misapprehension, namely, that we wish to install Hindi in the place of English.
('66', 451, 1, 7, 789305) Some indeed feel that only English can be and has in fact become the national language.
('66', 451, 1, 8, 789393) If Hindi could take the place of English I for one should be happy.
('66', 451, 1, 9, 789461) But we realize full well the importance of the English language.
('66', 451, 1, 10, 789526) We need the knowledge of English for the study of science and of modern literature, for contact with the rest of the world, for trade and commerce, for keeping in touch with the officials and for various other things.
('66', 451, 1, 11, 789744) We have to learn English whether we wish or not.
('66', 451, 1, 12, 789793) And this is exactly what is happening.
('66', 451, 1, 13, 789832) English is an international language.
('66', 451, 1, 14, 789870) But English can never become the national language.
('66', 451, 1, 15, 789922) Today it looks like having the sway.
('66', 451, 1, 16, 789959) Notwithstanding our great efforts to free ourselves from it, English continues to occupy a very large place in the national work.
('66', 451, 1, 17, 790089) But from this we should not fall into the delusion that English is becoming our national language.
('66', 451, 1, 18, 790188) We can easily test this in each province.
('66', 451, 1, 19, 790230) Take Bengal or South India where the influence of English is the greatest.
('66', 451, 1, 20, 790305) There if we wish to get anything done through the masses, we may not be able to get it done through Hindi, but we certainly cannot get it done in English.
('66', 451, 1, 21, 790460) We certainly can express ourselves a little bit with the help of a few words of Hindi.
('66', 451, 1, 22, 790547) We cannot do so at all in English.
('66', 451, 1, 23, 790582) Yes, it may be admitted that up till now no language has become the national language.
('66', 451, 1, 24, 790669) English is the official language.
('66', 451, 1, 25, 790703) It is only natural.
('66', 451, 1, 26, 790723) I cannot see English advancing any further however strenuous the efforts that may be made in this regard.
('66', 451, 1, 27, 790829) If India is to become one nation, whether one admits it or not Hindi alone can be our national language, because no other language can have the place Hindi has.
('66', 451, 1, 28, 790990) Hindi, i.e., Hindustani, with some variations here and there, is the language of 22 crores of people, Hindus and Muslims taken together.
('66', 451, 1, 29, 791127) Therefore it is proper and practicable that there should be a regional language within each province, Hindi for the inter provincial communications and English for international intercourse.
('66', 451, 1, 30, 791318) The number of people speaking Hindi will run into
('66', 452, 0, 1, 791368) VOL. 66 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 453
('66', 452, 1, 2, 791415) crores, whereas those speaking English will never exceed a few lakhs.
('66', 452, 1, 3, 791485) It will be an injustice to the masses even to try.
('66', 452, 1, 4, 791536) I just now used the expression “Hindi Hindustani”.
('66', 452, 1, 5, 791587) In 1918 when you honoured me with this office, I had said the same thing, namely, that Hindi is that language which is spoken both by Hindus and Muslims naturally and without effort.
('66', 452, 1, 6, 791770) There is no difference between Hindustani and Urdu.
('66', 452, 1, 7, 791822) Written in the Devanagari script it is called Hindi, and written in the Arabic script it is called Urdu.
('66', 452, 1, 8, 791927) The writer or the speaker who deliberately uses too many Sanskrit or Persian or Arabic words does a disservice to the country.
('66', 452, 1, 9, 792054) Our national language should contain all the words that are in common use.
('66', 452, 1, 10, 792129) Shri Ghanshyamdas Birla has rightly said that advocates of Hindi should adopt words of other provincial languages which have become conventional.
('66', 452, 1, 11, 792275) Every living language has this capacity to absorb words from other languages.
('66', 452, 1, 12, 792353) That is how it acquires universality.
('66', 452, 1, 13, 792391) What has English not adopted?
('66', 452, 1, 14, 792421) There are so many Latin and Greek idioms that have been absorbed into English.
('66', 452, 1, 15, 792500) They have not spared even modern languages.
('66', 452, 1, 16, 792544) Their impartiality in this is praiseworthy.
('66', 452, 1, 17, 792588) English has borrowed many Hindustani words.
('66', 452, 1, 18, 792632) Some words taken from African languages are also found in English.
('66', 452, 1, 19, 792699) In this the English have maintained their policy of “free trade”.
('66', 452, 1, 20, 792765) In saying this I do not mean that we should indiscriminately introduce words from other languages into Hindi as English educated youths of today do.
('66', 452, 1, 21, 792914) This should be done with discretion.
('66', 452, 1, 22, 792951) We are not paupers, but we shall not also be miserly.
('66', 452, 1, 23, 793005) We shall call a chair a “kursi” not “chatushpadapith” .
('66', 452, 1, 24, 793061) Let me take this opportunity to tell you of my own distress.
('66', 452, 1, 25, 793122) Whether Hindi becomes the national language or not, I cannot give it up.
('66', 452, 1, 26, 793195) As a worshipper of Tulsidas my love for Hindi will remain.
('66', 452, 1, 27, 793254) But where is a Rabindranath among those who speak Hindi?
('66', 452, 1, 28, 793311) Where is a Profulla Chandra Ray?
('66', 452, 1, 29, 793344) Where is a Jagdish Bose?
('66', 452, 1, 30, 793369) I can name several others.
('66', 452, 1, 31, 793396) I Know such men are not born by my merely wishing it, or thousands like me wishing it.
('66', 452, 1, 32, 793483) But it is only natural to expect that if a language has to become the national language it will have to produce a few such men.
('66', 452, 1, 33, 793611) There is in Wardha a girls’ school.
('66', 452, 1, 34, 793647) Several girls are preparing there for the Sammelan examinations.
('66', 452, 1, 35, 793712) Both teachers and girls complain that not all the prescribed text books are fit to be read.
('66', 452, 1, 36, 793804) It has been complained that they are too full of erotic matter.
('66', 452, 1, 37, 793868) There is erotic literature in Hindi.
('66', 452, 1, 38, 793905) Shri Benarsidas Chaturvedi had drawn my attention to this a few years ago.
('66', 452, 1, 39, 793980) The literature of the language which
('66', 453, 0, 1, 794017) 454 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 453, 1, 2, 794059) we wish to make our national language should be pure, radiant and lofty.
('66', 453, 1, 3, 794132) there is a good deal of obscene literature in Hindi.
('66', 453, 1, 4, 794185) Editors of periodicals are either not careful or they deliberately encourage obscenity in the writings.
('66', 453, 1, 5, 794289) In my opinion the Sammelan should not remain indifferent in this matter.
('66', 453, 1, 6, 794362) Good writers should get encouragement from the Sammelan.
('66', 453, 1, 7, 794419) People should also get some help from the Sammelan in choosing the right books.
('66', 453, 1, 8, 794499) The task no doubt is difficult but we cannot run away from difficulties.
('66', 453, 1, 9, 794572) A Muslim who knows the Devanagari script well has a complaint about one of the text books.
('66', 453, 1, 10, 794663) It contains disparaging things about Mogul emperors which are not even historically true.
('66', 453, 1, 11, 794753) I humbly submit that great care should be exercised in the choice of text books; they should have a nationalistic bias and the syllabus should be drawn up keeping in view the modern needs.
('66', 453, 1, 12, 794942) I know that all this that I have said is outside my province.
('66', 453, 1, 13, 795004) But I considered it my duty to put before you the complaints that were brought to me.

('66', 453, 6, 18, 795204) SHRIMAN MAHARAJA SAHEB, MAHARANI SAHEBA, CHAIRMAN OF THE RECEPTION COMMITTEE, SISTERS AND BROTHERS,
('66', 453, 7, 19, 795304) On behalf of you all and on my own behalf I thank the Maharaja Saheb for declaring this session open.
('66', 453, 7, 20, 795406) I consider it my good fortune that when I last came to Indore to preside over another session of the Sammelan, Your Highness was the Crown Prince.
('66', 453, 7, 21, 795553) It was as Crown Prince that you had opened the proceedings of that Sammelan and now as the Maharaja you have performed the same office for this Sammelan.
('66', 453, 7, 22, 795707) You have all heard the speech of His Highness and so have I, most attentively.
('66', 453, 7, 23, 795786) If I can give anything in return for it, it can only be my thanks.
('66', 453, 7, 24, 795853) If the sentiments that the Maharaja Saheb has expressed for the Hindi language are to be acted upon all over India, then Maharajas like His Highness will also have to do some real work.
('66', 453, 7, 25, 796039) As the Chairman of the Reception Committee has
('66', 453, 8, 26, 796086) 1 Gandhiji delivered this speech as president of the Sammelan in addition to the written address, the preceding item.
('66', 454, 0, 1, 796204) VOL. 60 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 455
('66', 454, 1, 2, 796251) recalled in his speech, when the 8th session of the Samme lan was held in Indore, Your Highness had donated Rs. 10,000 for the propagation of Hindi.
('66', 454, 1, 3, 796400) I sincerely hope that in the same manner now, in order to fulfil the request made by the Reception Committee, full help will be forthcoming.
('66', 454, 1, 4, 796541) I consider it our good fortune that while Your Highness then gave help as the Crown Prince, now Your Highness will be doing so as the Maharaja.
('66', 454, 1, 5, 796685) Our millionaire Seth Hukumchandji is also present here.
('66', 454, 1, 6, 796741) He garlanded me this morning.
('66', 454, 1, 7, 796771) Although the garland was of yarn, its worth is the worth of the person who garlands.
('66', 454, 1, 8, 796856) Rai Bahadur Dr. Sarjuprasadji is also present here.
('66', 454, 1, 9, 796908) He is ill, and, like all of you, I feel sorry about it.
('66', 454, 1, 10, 796964) There is no question of his lacking in love for the Hindi language or the Sammelan.
('66', 454, 1, 11, 797048) I have full confidence that whatever has to be done will meet with success.
('66', 454, 1, 12, 797124) In spite of this, there is some commotion in the Hindi world.
('66', 454, 1, 13, 797186) I had had an inkling of it in Wardha and after coming here I have understood the situation more fully.
('66', 454, 1, 14, 797289) It is not still known how this commotion started.
('66', 454, 1, 15, 797339) It is not true that the spread of Hindi in South India is not connected in any way with the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan; because that work is an inalienable part of the work of Hindi Sahitya Sammelan.
('66', 454, 1, 16, 797535) The Hindi Sahitya Sammelan is the mother or the father, whatever you may choose to call it, of Hindi Prachar in South India.
('66', 454, 1, 17, 797660) If it were not so, it would have been impossible for 6,00,000 people in South India to have learnt to speak or write Hindi as they do.
('66', 454, 1, 18, 797795) For this spread of Hindi thanks are due to Hindi Sahitya Sammelan.
('66', 454, 1, 19, 797862) No thanks are due to me for this, because whatever I did I did as President of the Sammelan.
('66', 454, 1, 20, 797955) There was nothing personal in it.
('66', 454, 1, 21, 797989) I can say this much that, propagation of Hindi is an inalienable part of the work of the Sammelan.
('66', 454, 1, 22, 798088) If the Sahitya Sammelan should concern itself only with the growth of literature and not propagate Hindi, how can Hindi become the national language?
('66', 454, 1, 23, 798238) Yes, it is our bounden duty to promote the growth of literature, but growth of literature cannot make Hindi the national language.
('66', 454, 1, 24, 798369) Bengali is rich in literature, so rich that no other language can stand comparison with it.
('66', 454, 1, 25, 798461) Marathi occupies the second place in literature.
('66', 454, 1, 26, 798510) Hindi would perhaps be placed third or even fourth.
('66', 454, 1, 27, 798562) Even that I doubt.
('66', 454, 1, 28, 798581) But Hindi is spoken by a majority of people and it is an easy language to learn and to read, and therefore only Hindi has a claim to becoming the national language.
('66', 454, 1, 29, 798746) If the propagation of Hindi were not a part of the work of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, then a person like me would be unfit to be its President, because I have done nothing for Hindi literature.
('66', 454, 1, 30, 798941) I wanted to read out
('66', 455, 0, 1, 798962) 456 THE COLLECECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 455, 1, 2, 799006) my written address, but speakers put up resolutions and took up the time.
('66', 455, 1, 3, 799080) It was pointless to move resolutions because no one could snatch away my rights.
('66', 455, 1, 4, 799161) The programme of the Sammelan will continue only for a few minutes.
('66', 455, 1, 5, 799229) So, I wish to end this session by 7.30. From the point of view of Hindi literature I am most unsuited as President.
('66', 455, 1, 6, 799345) Of the few girls that are present here, many have passed Prathama and are preparing to sit for the Madhyama.
('66', 455, 1, 7, 799454) Even if I sat only for the Prathama, Purushottamdasji here may not give me enough marks to pass it because I do not know grammar.
('66', 455, 1, 8, 799584) I have not the least objection to agree to what Jayaswalji has said.
('66', 455, 1, 9, 799653) I am not partial to the Gujarati language.
('66', 455, 1, 10, 799696) I have been made the President so that, through me some work for the spread of Hindi may get done.
('66', 455, 1, 11, 799795) If the criterion was qualification, then even one of the girls could have been in this chair even as was the case with Queen Victoria.
('66', 455, 1, 12, 799930) The Secretary just said, “I shall do everything.
('66', 455, 1, 13, 799979) You have only to assent.” That is not quite so.
('66', 455, 1, 14, 800027) I have been chosen President and my condition that you will give me a lakh of rupees has been accepted so that through me Hindi Prachar should be well conducted.
('66', 455, 1, 15, 800189) Poetry now has many branches.
('66', 455, 1, 16, 800219) You can hear about them from poets to your hearts’ content; but through me you will hear only about the spread of Hindi because I have no mastery over other fields.
('66', 455, 1, 17, 800384) When I had come to Indore on an earlier occasion to assume the presidentship of the Sammelan, I had craved the blessings of Malaviyaji Maharaj and he had sent me a long letter of blessings.
('66', 455, 1, 18, 800574) Now that he is stricken with illness and also overburdened with work, I crave blessings from all of you.
('66', 455, 1, 19, 800679) Malaviyaji, on account of ill health and also because he has to go abroad, could not assume the president ship of the Sammelan.
('66', 455, 1, 20, 800807) The Reception Committee was therefore obliged to choose me.
('66', 455, 1, 21, 800867) Malaviyaji’s telegram has also come, in which he has sent me his blessings.
('66', 455, 1, 22, 800943) It is not necessary to translate the full text of the tele gram.
('66', 455, 1, 23, 801008) I pray to God that he may live for a hundred years and may enjoy good health all through.
('66', 455, 1, 24, 801098) He is seventy years of age, and when he works, he does so like a youth of seventeen.
('66', 455, 1, 25, 801183) May God give him a long life.
('66', 455, 1, 26, 801213) May he continue to serve India as he is doing.
('66', 455, 1, 27, 801260) I have come here with his blessings and as his deputy.
('66', 455, 1, 28, 801315) His efforts for the spread of Hindi in South India and other provinces are well known.
('66', 455, 1, 29, 801402) He loves the work as much as you and I do.
('66', 455, 1, 30, 801445) There are three questions before us today; it is necessary to make them clear.
('66', 455, 1, 31, 801524) There are three things before people who wish to donate money.
('66', 455, 1, 32, 801587) The first concerns the
('66', 456, 0, 1, 801610) VOL. 60 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 457
('66', 456, 1, 2, 801657) university, of which the Maharaja Saheb has made a mention with satisfaction.
('66', 456, 1, 3, 801735) Donations have to be sought for it also.
('66', 456, 1, 4, 801776) People can either donate money for the university or for the spread of Hindi.
('66', 456, 1, 5, 801854) He who has three cowries to give, for him there is no problem.
('66', 456, 1, 6, 801917) But he who has a single cowrie, to whom shall he give it?
('66', 456, 1, 7, 801975) For a cowrie cannot be split.
('66', 456, 1, 8, 802005) The Maharaja Saheb, Seth Hukumchandji and Dr. Sarjuprasad are all present here.
('66', 456, 1, 9, 802085) Even if they say no, I can answer that the people of Indore should first help the university if they are fully convinced that this work is good, that there is spirit in the workers and they have the desire to work earnestly.
('66', 456, 1, 10, 802310) Many people say all sorts of things, but when they are asked what they can do, they answer that they have poetic talents.
('66', 456, 1, 11, 802432) This should not be so.
('66', 456, 1, 12, 802455) Once you are convinced that everything for the university is ready and only money is needed, donating money should be your first concern.
('66', 456, 1, 13, 802593) After this comes the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan and the propagation of Hindi in South India.
('66', 456, 1, 14, 802682) I am saying this as President of the Sammelan.
('66', 456, 1, 15, 802729) Because while I am the President I should not do anything that would harm the Sammelan or hinder collection of funds and I would certainly do nothing against the rules of the Sammelan.
('66', 456, 1, 16, 802914) Because, in accepting this office, I have taken on a very heavy responsibility as I have realized within the last few hours.
('66', 456, 1, 17, 803039) To make it a success is my duty.
('66', 456, 1, 18, 803072) I can, therefore, assure you that all the strength I possess, all the strength God can give me, shall be used to make this enterprise a success.
('66', 456, 1, 19, 803217) There has to be one script if Hindi is to spread everywhere.
('66', 456, 1, 20, 803278) There is going to be a script conference for this purpose about which you shall hear more from Kakasaheb.
('66', 456, 1, 21, 803384) Hindi is born from Sanskrit.
('66', 456, 1, 22, 803413) Assamese and Bengali too are related to it.
('66', 456, 1, 23, 803457) The South Indian languages are believed to be of Dravidian origin.
('66', 456, 1, 24, 803524) My own belief is that they too have sprung from Sanskrit.
('66', 456, 1, 25, 803582) Regarding the Dravidians, some assert that they were uncivilized in the beginning and became civilized later.
('66', 456, 1, 26, 803692) But the Tamilians say that they were not uncivilized but had enjoyed a high degree of culture.
('66', 456, 1, 27, 803787) Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and other languages are replete with Sanskrit words.
('66', 456, 1, 28, 803863) Bengali too is rich in Sanskrit words.
('66', 456, 1, 29, 803902) When they are short of words, these languages borrow from Sanskrit.
('66', 456, 1, 30, 803970) Thus, therefore, a common script for all the languages is necessary.
('66', 456, 1, 31, 804039) In order to achieve this, modifications in Devanagari may be necessary.
('66', 456, 1, 32, 804111) But I do not wish to involve myself in this.
('66', 456, 1, 33, 804156) I have just put forth an idea before you, since I believe that a common script will make the languages easy to learn.
('66', 456, 1, 34, 804274) Kakasaheb has taken the responsibility and he will carry on the work for this, When Kakasaheb went to Assam and Utkal from South India, he had to face
('66', 457, 0, 1, 804425) 458 THE COLLECECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 457, 1, 2, 804469) a difficulty of the magnitude of the Vindhyas.
('66', 457, 1, 3, 804516) People began to murmur that he planned to supplant their languages with Hindi.
('66', 457, 1, 4, 804595) But that is not so.
('66', 457, 1, 5, 804615) What is intended is that while the regional languages should continue to be used Hindi should be specially learnt so that it may become the national language.
('66', 457, 1, 6, 804774) Bengali for that matter is rich in literature but it can never become the national language.
('66', 457, 1, 7, 804867) But I wish to have it clearly stipulated that Hindi shall not supplant any regional language.
('66', 457, 1, 8, 804961) Hindi Sahitya Sammelan should, through a resolution, make a clear statement on the question.
('66', 457, 1, 9, 805054) Hindi is our national language.
('66', 457, 1, 10, 805086) It should not be packed with words from Sanskrit.
('66', 457, 1, 11, 805136) One comes across writings which are full of Sanskrit words which village folk cannot understand at all.
('66', 457, 1, 12, 805240) Trying to make Hindi the national language while ignoring our seven crore Muslim brethren would be like trying to plant flowers in the void and smelling their scent.
('66', 457, 1, 13, 805406) Village folk are simple people.
('66', 457, 1, 14, 805438) They understand plain and simple language only.
('66', 457, 1, 15, 805486) In the exhibition put up here we are told what is done in Indore State.
('66', 457, 1, 16, 805558) What do your brethren in villages wish to make?
('66', 457, 1, 17, 805606) Are those things useful to us or not?
('66', 457, 1, 18, 805644) It is also necessary to ask whether there is a contact between us—the townsmen and the villagers.
('66', 457, 1, 19, 805742) Many in the towns believe that they have very little connection with the villages but as far as I know, there is a very strong connection between the townsmen and the villagers.
('66', 457, 1, 20, 805920) I shall even say that everything India has comes from the peasantry.
('66', 457, 1, 21, 805989) If they refuse to do our work, then we shall have to starve and this is true of the Maharaja Saheb and of Seth Hukumchandji as well.
('66', 457, 1, 22, 806122) For no one can feed on gold and silver.
('66', 457, 1, 23, 806162) They need not resort to satyagraha as I do.
('66', 457, 1, 24, 806206) They can just say that since they do not have enough to eat they cannot work and the townspeople will have a hard time of it.
('66', 457, 1, 25, 806332) In India everything depends on the villagers.
('66', 457, 1, 26, 806378) Therefore it is necessary that we use a language that they can understand.
('66', 457, 1, 27, 806453) It is also not right for us to exclude words of Arabic or Persian origin.
('66', 457, 1, 28, 806527) Because, by doing so we cannot make Hindi the national language.
('66', 457, 1, 29, 806592) For this work I wish to beg funds from all of you.
('66', 457, 1, 30, 806643) This task can be accomplished with the blessings of the Maharaja Saheb.
('66', 457, 1, 31, 806715) Whether you call anyone a Mahatma or by any other title, only making efforts can we make a success of this work.
('66', 457, 1, 32, 806828) I shall not run away with your one lakh rupees.
('66', 457, 1, 33, 806876) But I shall endeavour to bring glory to this work.
('66', 457, 1, 34, 806927) Harihar Sharma learnt some Hindi in Prayag and went to Madras.
('66', 457, 1, 35, 806990) There he carried on some Hindi Pracher.
('66', 457, 1, 36, 807030) What he has

('66', 458, 1, 2, 807089) achieved is shown at the exhibition.
('66', 458, 1, 3, 807126) If you wish to see it, you can do so even today.
('66', 458, 1, 4, 807175) It was my duty to draw your attention to it.
('66', 458, 1, 5, 807220) How much work remains to be done in the ten minutes that remain or when to close the session, is left to the Maharaja Saheb and is not my concern.

('66', 458, 5, 9, 807497) INDORE, April 20, 1935
('66', 458, 6, 10, 807520) Exhibition does not mean collecting artisans and indigenous products of villages in the vicinity of cities dependent upon villages.
('66', 458, 6, 11, 807652) The civilization of India rests on seventy lakhs of villages, not cities.
('66', 458, 6, 12, 807726) Our English Amaldars say ten per cent of the people of India do not get food at all and the rest get only a small quantity of rice, salt and flour.
('66', 458, 6, 13, 807874) Chemists inform us that the scanty food which Indians get cannot help to develop their mental, physical and spiritual power.
('66', 458, 6, 14, 807999) Whatever we eat does not nourish us; we and the villagers both are dying.
('66', 458, 6, 15, 808073) People say village uplift in India is impossible, but foreign lands like America give an example to the contrary.
('66', 458, 6, 16, 808187) When there were no machines in India, a single work was done by a hundred hands and all of them remained employed, but today growth of machinery has left 98 people out of 100 unemployed.
('66', 458, 6, 17, 808374) Look at America, where sweeping engines are lying useless on roads.
('66', 458, 6, 18, 808442) In the Western world unemployment means not getting even salt and rice.
('66', 458, 6, 19, 808514) Experts say the land of India is not sufficient for the increasing population, but it is not so.
('66', 458, 6, 20, 808611) The Exhibition should consist of things of everyday use and not of things which we either like or want to use, like wine, etc.
('66', 458, 6, 21, 808738) It is better to buy pure ghee at double the price.
('66', 458, 6, 22, 808789) It is cheaper for us than to use cheap but adulterated ghee.
('66', 458, 7, 23, 808850) Mahatma Gandhi declared that mere demonstration of rural products would be insufficient to help the cause of Village Industries Association.
('66', 458, 7, 24, 808991) It was high timemethods were devised by means of which the masses could be clothed and fed.
('66', 458, 7, 25, 809083) Village industries in India were in a dying state today and the responsibility for it
('66', 458, 8, 26, 809169) 1 The exhibition was held at Biscoe Park.
('66', 459, 0, 1, 809211) 460 THE COLLECECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('66', 459, 1, 2, 809255) mainly lay with the people.
('66', 459, 1, 3, 809283) They could expiate their sin only by actively supporting the revival of the decaying village industries.
('66', 459, 1, 4, 809388) He opined that Indian rural regeneration could only come by falling back on the old system of making every small unit of population self supporting in all its needs.

('66', 459, 4, 8, 809644) BHAI RAJENDRA SINGH,
('66', 459, 5, 9, 809665) I hope the Harijan Conference will be an all round success.
('66', 459, 5, 10, 809725) That is to say that the savarna Hindus will realize their dharma and abide by it and Harijans will also realize theirs.
('66', 459, 5, 11, 809845) Both should know that without this kind of two way self purification it is difficult for Hinduism to survive.

('66', 459, 10, 17, 810111) BHAI PURUSHOTTAM BHAVISHI,
('66', 459, 11, 18, 810138) I saw your letter yesterday.
('66', 459, 11, 19, 810167) You may come with your friend today at two.
('66', 459, 11, 20, 810211) I shall of course be observing silence, but that will not matter.
('66', 459, 11, 21, 810277) For most of the time you will be doing the explaining.
('66', 459, 12, 22, 810332) Blessings from BAPU

('66', 459, 15, 25, 810475) April 22, 1935
('66', 459, 16, 26, 810490) HARILAL,
('66', 459, 17, 27, 810499) There is no need at all to be in a hurry to come to a decision about Amala’s letter.
('66', 459, 17, 28, 810584) I think you will have to drop the idea.
('66', 460, 0, 1, 810624) VOL. 60 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 461
('66', 460, 1, 2, 810671) should write and tell her plainly that any children that may be born will have to be brought up in a simple manner.
('66', 460, 1, 3, 810787) And whatever means of livelihood the Lord provides will probably be in Wardha.
('66', 460, 1, 4, 810866) If you start going to women or drinking, she should be free to leave you immediately.
('66', 460, 1, 5, 810952) And even this you may write only if you are sure that you wish to marry her.
('66', 460, 1, 6, 811029) Amala’s letter seems a good one to me, but I didn’t know her as she reveals herself in it.
('66', 460, 1, 7, 811120) I am, therefore, of the view that you will not be happy unless she comes to feel strongly that she cannot live without you.
('66', 460, 1, 8, 811244) It is certainly a good thing that you have not become impatient.
('66', 460, 1, 9, 811309) Have patience and do only what is proper.

('66', 460, 5, 13, 811471) April 22, 1935
('66', 460, 6, 14, 811486) MANUDI, I got your letter in Indore.
('66', 460, 6, 15, 811523) You need not ask me whether or not you should go to Bombay.
('66', 460, 6, 16, 811583) Respect the wishes of your aunt.
('66', 460, 6, 17, 811616) I did read about your having entered the nineteenth year.
('66', 460, 6, 18, 811674) But what you write were only fancies of your mind.
('66', 460, 6, 19, 811725) What made you write it?
('66', 460, 6, 20, 811749) I haven’t thought even once from that point of view.
('66', 460, 6, 21, 811802) But now perhaps I may think.
('66', 460, 6, 22, 811831) Does all that you write mean that you wish to get married now?
('66', 460, 6, 23, 811894) If so, you should say so plainly.
('66', 460, 6, 24, 811928) We don’t regard it as anything to be ashamed of.
('66', 460, 6, 25, 811977) It is a quite natural desire.
('66', 460, 6, 26, 812007) Yes, to me you seem to be a girl of twelve or so.
('66', 460, 6, 27, 812057) But it is possible that your body has changed recently.
('66', 460, 6, 28, 812113) If you feel that you have grown up, there is nothing more to be said about it.
('66', 460, 6, 29, 812192) Write to me openly what you wish.
('66', 460, 6, 30, 812226) We shall return to Indore 1 on Wednesday or Thursday.

('66', 461, 2, 3, 812539) INDORE, April 22, 1935
('66', 461, 3, 4, 812562) BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
('66', 461, 4, 5, 812580) I have gone through your speech.
('66', 461, 4, 6, 812613) It won’t do.
('66', 461, 4, 7, 812626) We should not criticize the Government’s policy in that tone at the present time.
('66', 461, 4, 8, 812708) This is not the time for examining the Government’s policies or of the zemindars; it is a time for introspection, for putting and keeping our house in order.
('66', 461, 4, 9, 812866) You should not, therefore, expect me to discuss anything just now except what we ourselves ought to do.
('66', 461, 4, 10, 812970) After these prefatory remarks, I would point out the duty of cultivators without so much as mentioning the Government even once.
('66', 461, 4, 11, 813099) We had better forget New Delhi for the present.
('66', 461, 4, 12, 813147) If, however, this does not appeal to you, you may say what the Lord in your heart prompts you to say.

('66', 461, 9, 17, 813375) BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
('66', 461, 10, 18, 813393) I wrote a letter to you this morning.
('66', 461, 10, 19, 813431) After that I had to write so much that I cannot write with the right hand any more today.
('66', 461, 10, 20, 813521) If you think it necessary to make Munshi the secretary of the Board 1, you may consider doing so.
('66', 461, 10, 21, 813619) Now that Ansari has resigned, will Bhulabhai become the President?
('66', 461, 10, 22, 813686) If you can persuade Raja by some means, do so.

('66', 462, 3, 4, 813958) JAMNALAL, I have had a fairly long talk with Kamalnayan.
('66', 462, 3, 5, 814015) 1 can come here before the engagement takes place, I think I may also examine her a little.
('66', 462, 3, 6, 814107) Kamalnayan also has approved of this.
('66', 462, 3, 7, 814145) I have, therefore, given him a letter to that effect addressed to .

('66', 462, 11, 19, 814811) Mahatmaji expressed his regrets to the delegates and the assembled public for having been late.
('66', 462, 11, 20, 814907) He said the election of members of the Standing Committee and the resolutions, etc., had taken up so much time that with all the will in the world he was not able to arrive in time.

('66', 463, 1, 2, 815340) Prachar, he said: The alms for which I am appealing to you could be split up into three parts.
('66', 463, 1, 3, 815435) If you wish, you may deposit your donation in the office of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, or you may donate for the Hindi University which is being planned for Indore, or you may give money to help in the propagation of Hindi in South India and other provinces.
('66', 463, 1, 4, 815695) While donating, if you do not specify whether it is for the Hindi University or for the promotion of Hindi in non Hindi speaking States, the donation will automatically be sent to the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan office.
('66', 463, 1, 5, 815910) You should specially donate for the Hindi University, and thepropagation of Hindi.
('66', 463, 1, 6, 815993) I do not mean that you should ignore the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan.
('66', 463, 1, 7, 816058) But the first two tasks are of primary importance and should be started very soon.
('66', 463, 1, 8, 816141) The Hindi Sahitya Sammelan is self supporting.
('66', 463, 1, 9, 816188) Its programme of examinations is financed from the fee charged from students, small though it may be.
('66', 463, 1, 10, 816290) It has started independent institutions like the Hindi Prachar Sabha for the spread of Hindi in South India which are no burden to it.
('66', 463, 1, 11, 816425) They are self supporting.
('66', 463, 1, 12, 816451) The cost of publishing Hindi literature is met fully from the sale of books.
('66', 463, 1, 13, 816528) The cost of printing and other expenses of the Ojha Welcome Volume which has been presented to me, is met by donations from Rajas and Maharajas.
('66', 463, 1, 14, 816673) Because the cost of printing, cost of articles therein and the cost of illustrations are very heavy in such books, the articles in this volume have been obtained free of charge.
('66', 463, 1, 15, 816851) And so the expense of bringing out this volume is less.
('66', 463, 1, 16, 816907) It is also priced low at Rs. 12 per copy.
('66', 463, 1, 17, 816949) Otherwise such a volume would cost not less than Rs. 50 or Rs. 60. My contention is that, whatever is spent in bringing out this work, is got from Rajas and Maharajas and later from the sale of it.
('66', 463, 1, 18, 817147) I am sure you will have now understood what I have said.
('66', 463, 1, 19, 817204) Some money is needed for the museum whose foundations were laid by the Sahitya Sammelan, and on which more than half the construction work is over.
('66', 463, 1, 20, 817352) Otherwise, it will remain incomplete.
('66', 463, 1, 21, 817390) Wood and other material bought for the construction is lying idle.
('66', 463, 1, 22, 817457) Unless a work which is begun is completed in a short time, it goes to waste.
('66', 463, 1, 23, 817534) To complete the building, ten to fifteen thousand rupees are needed.
('66', 463, 1, 24, 817603) Until you donate towards its construction its doors will remain closed.
('66', 463, 1, 25, 817675) In addition to this I beg you for donations for the spread of Hindi in the South, the burden of which is not upon the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan.
('66', 463, 1, 26, 817817) As the Sanskrit saying goes, “plenty yields plenty”, the more you give the more will be the benefits you will get.
('66', 463, 1, 27, 817932) Now, I wish to repeat to you that before you give your donation,
('66', 464, 0, 1, 817997) VOL. 60 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 465
('66', 464, 1, 2, 818044) please state whether it is to be deposited in the office of the Sammelan, or is for the Hindi University or meant for the spread of Hindi in other provinces.
('66', 464, 1, 3, 818202) It is up to you if you do not wish to make any donation at all.
('66', 464, 1, 4, 818266) It is neither against the law nor a matter for regret.
('66', 464, 1, 5, 818321) If you donate nothing for the spread of Hindi but only give your contribution to the office or to the University, I shall understand that you have given your donation to me.
('66', 464, 1, 6, 818495) I shall not feel hurt by that.
('66', 464, 1, 7, 818526) This year, even as an obligation, I must ask you for donations for the Sammelan.
('66', 464, 1, 8, 818607) I do not wish to say more to you, and before I start my work with the speed of a railway train, I request you to give your donations quietly.
('66', 464, 1, 9, 818749) If you have the money on you, you can give your donations now.
('66', 464, 1, 10, 818812) But if you have not brought it with you, please give your names and addresses.
('66', 464, 1, 11, 818891) Later, members of the Reception Committee can collect them from you and send them to the office.
('66', 464, 1, 12, 818988) There are volunteers here.
('66', 464, 1, 13, 819015) They will come round to you.
('66', 464, 1, 14, 819044) Whatever you wish to donate you can either give or put the amount against your name.
('66', 464, 1, 15, 819129) You know that I am ready to snatch away even the jewellery from the sisters.
('66', 464, 1, 16, 819206) So they have realized that they should wear no jewellery in my presence.
('66', 464, 1, 17, 819279) If they want to take to stealing in this way, they may.
('66', 464, 1, 18, 819335) But I will say to you sisters, that by the establishment of a University in Indore, and with the spread of Hindi in other provinces the service rendered to the brothers and sisters who are poor brings its benefits to you also.
('66', 464, 1, 19, 819562) Therefore, those sisters who wish to give their ornaments can do so.
('66', 464, 1, 20, 819631) Whatever you give as charity should be given whole heartedly and not grudgingly.
('66', 464, 1, 21, 819712) The volunteers will come to you now because there are many representatives who are unable to donate anything themselves.
('66', 464, 1, 22, 819833) So, those among the onlookers who have money, please donate quickly.
('66', 464, 1, 23, 819902) I shall have to hurry with the remaining work like a train after this because I shall have to end this by half past five and quit.
('66', 464, 1, 24, 820033) Pandit Lakshminarayanji of Indore has presented his house Jagannath Trivedi Bhavan worth fifty thousand rupees to the Hindi University.
('66', 464, 1, 25, 820169) And, therefore, he deserves our thanks.
('66', 464, 1, 26, 820209) If the people here follow his example, and if we have the goodwill of the Maharaja, then your University can become the Indore Hindi University like the Osmania University.
('66', 464, 1, 27, 820382) I shall now end my speech with this and volunteers will be approaching you.
('66', 464, 1, 28, 820458) Please give whatever you wish.

('66', 465, 1, 2, 820606) 685. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, INDORE 1
('66', 465, 2, 3, 820646) April 23, 1935
('66', 465, 3, 4, 820661) The bulk of those who have come here are citizens of Indore.
('66', 465, 3, 5, 820722) There are people from the villages too, but the majority are from Indore.
('66', 465, 3, 6, 820796) You must have seen the exhibition which untimely rain has unfortunately spoilt.
('66', 465, 3, 7, 820876) It was organized in order to remind the city dweller of his duty to the villager.
('66', 465, 3, 8, 820958) We have been oblivious of it all these years, but we can ill afford to be so now.
('66', 465, 3, 9, 821040) We may not know it, but it is certain that we are slowly perishing individually and as a nation.
('66', 465, 3, 10, 821137) It is no use laying the blame at other people’s door—the Government, the State, or the Zemindar.
('66', 465, 3, 11, 821234) They are certainly respons ible for our sorry plight, but we are no less responsible, and we had better bethink ourselves of our responsibility.
('66', 465, 3, 12, 821379) The reason why our average life rate is deplorably low, the reason why we are getting more and more impoverished is that we have neglected our 700,000 villages.
('66', 465, 3, 13, 821540) We have indeed thought of them, but only to the extent of exploiting them.
('66', 465, 3, 14, 821615) We read thrilling accounts of the glory that was India, and of the land that was flowing with milk and honey; but today it is a land of starving millions.
('66', 465, 3, 15, 821770) We are sitting in this fine pandal under a blaze of electric lights, but we do not know that we are burning these lights at the expense of the poor.
('66', 465, 3, 16, 821919) We have no right to use the lights if we forget that we owe these to them.
('66', 465, 3, 17, 821994) There is a difference between the civilization of the East—the civilization of India—and that of the West.
('66', 465, 3, 18, 822101) It is not generally realized wherein the difference lies.
('66', 465, 3, 19, 822159) Our geography is different, our history is different, our ways of living are different.
('66', 465, 3, 20, 822247) Our continent, though vast, is a speck on the globe, but it is the most thickly populated, barring China.
('66', 465, 3, 21, 822353) Well, now, the economics and civilization of a country where the pressure of population on land is greatest are and must be different from those of a country where the pressure is least.
('66', 465, 3, 22, 822540) Sparsely populated America may have need of machinery.
('66', 465, 3, 23, 822595) India may not need it at all.
('66', 465, 3, 24, 822625) Where there are millions upon millions of units of idle labourit is no use thinking of labour saving devices.
('66', 465, 3, 25, 822735) If someone devised a machine which saved us the trouble of using our hands to
('66', 465, 4, 26, 822813) 1 Extracted from Mahadev Desai’s report under the caption “Our Duty to the Villagers”.
('66', 465, 4, 27, 822900) The meeting was held in the pandal of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan and was largely attended.
('66', 465, 4, 28, 822991) The speech, of which this is a condensed summary, was in Hindi.
('66', 466, 0, 1, 823055) VOL. 60 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 467
('66', 466, 1, 2, 823102) eat, eating would cease to be a pleasure, it would become a torture.
('66', 466, 1, 3, 823171) The reason of our poverty is the extinction of our industries and our consequent unemployment.
('66', 466, 1, 4, 823266) Some years ago India’s agricultural population was said to be 70 per cent.
('66', 466, 1, 5, 823341) Today it is said to be 90 per cent.
('66', 466, 1, 6, 823377) It does not mean that 90 per cent are agriculturists, but that, instead of 70 per cent who depended on land, 90 per cent are now driven to depend on land.
('66', 466, 1, 7, 823532) In other words, whereas there were industries and crafts enough to feed the 20 per cent some time ago, these are no longer there and the people have thus been thrown on land.
('66', 466, 1, 8, 823707) They thus steal their living, not because they want to, but because there is no more land.
('66', 466, 1, 9, 823798) Not that there is not enough land to feed our 35 crores.
('66', 466, 1, 10, 823855) It is absurd to say that India is overpopulated and that the surplus population must die.
('66', 466, 1, 11, 823945) I am sure that if all the land that is available was properly utilized and made to yield up to its capacity, it would surely maintain the whole population.
('66', 466, 1, 12, 824101) Only we have got to be industrious and to make two blades of grass grow where one grows today.
('66', 466, 1, 13, 824196) The remedy is to identify ourselves with the poor villager and to help him make the land yield its plenty, help him produce what we need, and confine ourselves to use what he produces, live as he lives, and persuade him to take to more rational ways of diet and living.
('66', 466, 1, 14, 824466) We eat mill ground flour, and even the poor villager walks with a head load of half a maund grain to have it ground in the nearest flour mill.
('66', 466, 1, 15, 824609) Do you know that in spite of the plenty of food stuffs we produce, we import wheat from outside and we eat the ‘superfine’ flour from Australia?
('66', 466, 1, 16, 824754) We will not use our hand ground flour, and the poor villager also foolishly copies us.
('66', 466, 1, 17, 824841) We thus turn wealth into waste, nectar into poison.
('66', 466, 1, 18, 824893) For whole meal is the proper meal.
('66', 466, 1, 19, 824928) Mill ground flour is vitaminless flour, mill ground flour kept for days is not only not vitaminless, but poison.
('66', 466, 1, 20, 825041) But we will not exert ourselves to produce flour which we must eat fresh every day, and will pay for less nutritious things and purchase ill health into the bargain.
('66', 466, 1, 21, 825207) This is not any abstruse economic truth, it is a fact which is daily happening before our eyes.
('66', 466, 1, 22, 825303) The same is the case with rice and gur and oil.
('66', 466, 1, 23, 825351) We will eat rice, polished of its substance, and eat less nutritious sugar and pay more for it than more nutritious gur.
('66', 466, 1, 24, 825472) We have suffered thevillage oilman to be driven to extinction and we eat adulterated oils.
('66', 466, 1, 25, 825563) We idolize the cow, but kill her by slow degress.
('66', 466, 1, 26, 825613) We eat honey and kill the honey bee, with the result that honey is such a rare commodity today

('66', 467, 1, 3, 825891) If we took the trouble of learning scientific and harmless bee keeing, we should get it cheaper and our children would get out of it all the carbohydrates they need.
('66', 467, 1, 4, 826057) In all our dietetics we mistake the shadow for the substance, preferring bone white sugar to rich brown gur and pale white bread to rich brown bran bread.
('66', 467, 1, 5, 826212) We are said to be a nation of daily bathers.
('66', 467, 1, 6, 826257) That we are, to be sure, but we are none the better for it.
('66', 467, 1, 7, 826317) For we bathe with unclean water, we foul our tanks and rivers with filth and use that water for drinking and bath.
('66', 467, 1, 8, 826432) We lawyers and degree holders and doctors will not learn the elementary principles of sanitation and hygiene.
('66', 467, 1, 9, 826542) We have not yet devised the most economic method of disposal of our evacuations and we turn our open healthy spaces into breeding grounds of disease.
('66', 467, 1, 10, 826692) I implore you to throw off your inertia, to bestir yourselves to study these elementary facts and live more rational lives and learn how to turn waste into wealth.
('66', 467, 1, 11, 826856) I have told you simple truths which we would soon realize and act up to if we threw off the inertia of ages.
('66', 467, 1, 12, 826965) But we have shunned body labour to the detriment of our brains, and thus rest content with the irrational way of diet and living.
('66', 467, 1, 13, 827095) Let us pull ourselves together and resolve to make our bodies and brains more active.
('66', 467, 1, 14, 827181) I thank you for the patient attention you have given me.

('66', 467, 4, 17, 827295) INDORE, [April 24, 1935] 2
('66', 467, 5, 18, 827322) I am glad that my visit should have been instrumental in the ending of the two factions said to have been existing amongst you.
('66', 467, 5, 19, 827450) But I would now ask you to go a step further.
('66', 467, 5, 20, 827496) You must think of the interests of the area where you earn your living.
('66', 467, 5, 21, 827568) You must not think of sending out the whole of your savings to your families, but should use a portion for the Marathi and Hindi speaking people among

('66', 467, 6, 23, 827788) The Gujaratis of Indore had organized a function in Gandhiji’s honour and presented him a purse.
('66', 467, 6, 24, 827885) 2 The date is supplied from Gandhijini Dinwari.
('66', 468, 0, 1, 827933) VOL. 60 : 16 DECEMBER, 1934 24 APRIL, 1935 469
('66', 468, 1, 2, 827980) whom you live.
('66', 468, 1, 3, 827995) It is wrong to think that business is incompatible with ethics.
('66', 468, 1, 4, 828059) I know that it is perfectly possible to carry on one’s business profitably and yet honestly and truthfully.
('66', 468, 1, 5, 828167) The plea that business and ethics never agree is advanced only by those who are actuated by nothing higher than narrow self interest.
('66', 468, 1, 6, 828301) He who will serve his own ends will do so by all kinds of questionable means, but he who will earn to serve the community will never sacrifice truth or honesty.
('66', 468, 1, 7, 828462) You must bear in mind that you have the right to earn as much as you like, but not the right to spend as much as you like.
('66', 468, 1, 8, 828585) Anything that remains after the needs of a decent living are satisfied belongs to the community.
('66', 468, 1, 9, 828682) There should be no Gujarati here who is ignorant of Hindi.
('66', 468, 1, 10, 828741) When I say this I am thinking of women too.
('66', 468, 1, 11, 828785) For they must associate with Hindi speaking women here and give their share in the work of general social uplift.
('66', 468, 2, 12, 828899) The Gujarati Youth League asked for permission to take part in the function by separate speeches.
('66', 468, 2, 13, 828997) To them Gandhiji said: Would it not be better that I give you a couple of minutes than that you take a couple of minutes for speech making?
('66', 468, 2, 14, 829137) Well, I should like to leave you a message of silence.
('66', 468, 2, 15, 829192) Speech without the backing of experience based on action will lack chastity and refinement.
('66', 468, 2, 16, 829284) I would ask you to curb your tongues and make use of your hands and feet forthe service of the community.
('66', 468, 2, 17, 829390) After you have done so for a few years, you will speak the speech that counts and never fails.

('66', 468, 6, 21, 829562) Do not mind what the caste Hindus do or say.
('66', 468, 6, 22, 829607) Think of what you have to do.
('66', 468, 6, 23, 829637) It is no small thing that you still care for a religion which keeps you suppressed.
('66', 468, 6, 24, 829721) I do not know whether I should attribute it to the greatness of the religion or to your great power of suffering.

('66', 468, 7, 26, 829956) But in the report Mahadev Desai makes a reference to the day being crowded with functions and Gandhiji going without food till the train started.

('66', 469, 1, 2, 830174) But whatever it may be due to, I would ask you to be patient a little longer and to glorify the religion that you have adhered to through thick and thin.
('66', 469, 1, 3, 830328) You can do so by purifying your lives, by internal and external cleanliness, by giving up carrion and drink if you are given to them, and by prayer to God.
('66', 469, 1, 4, 830484) The name ‘Rama’ has a miraculous power if it is repeated from a faithful and pure heart.
